<p>〔本報南京六日電〕卅七年度上半年中央與地方財政之劃分辦法，於六日政務會議中通過，俟國務會中通過後即可付之實施。茲悉中央爲充裕地方財政，決定增加地方之稅收，卅六年度業將營業稅全部劃歸地方，現決將田賦收入亦全部劃歸地方。</p>

<h3>關於郵電加價案　政院報告國務會之決議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕關於郵電加價，前經國務會議通過後，據立院建議國務會議，請令飭政院將郵電加價案迅送本院審議，當由國府交法制審査委會審查，據報吿稱：「國務會議依法爲國府之最高國務機關，有制定立法原則之職權，幷依歷辦成案，國務會議以決議修正法律規定而先　執行者巳有實例，屬會以爲府委會依照國府組織法第十六條之規定，現爲國府之最高國務機關，而實例又如上述，故國務會議應認爲有權作權宜之處理，其第十六次會議關於郵電加價案之決議，應認爲合法有效」等語。經提出第十八次國務會議決議，「照審查意見通過，幷飭政院將郵電加價案補送立院完成，立法程序」。分令行政立法兩院知照。政院已於六日第卅七次會議提出報吿，幷送請立院完成立法程序。</p>

<h3>棉紗糧食狂漲經會硏討對策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全經會鑒於最近棉紗及糧食之先後狂漲，領導物價，特由該會秘書處研究其原因所在，經逐層分析，一一佔量其生產，加工，運轍，銷售，對貨價之影響，結果已大致斷定係在商塲銷售時額外利潤過大，共所佔貨價中之百分比，顯屬由於不合理之操縱而致超出合法營利範圍。現該會柲書處對此問題仍繼續硏討實際詳情及有效對策中。</p>
<h3>對日貿易指委會決定簽證記賬辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕對日貿易指導委會六日午舉行第九次會，由經次童季齡主持，會中討論簽證記賬辦法，當決定由我駐日商務專員簽發證明書後，中央信託局即根據此項蹬明書予以記賬，然後進出口貿易委會再據以簽發進出口許可證。該會定七日續舉行會議討論各貿易計劃中貿易貨品之種類及其數量之限制等問題</p>
<h3>外部情報司長　張沅長返京　暢談美國一般情形</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕外部情報司長張沅長，六日下午一時許自滬返抵南京，張夫人及外部秘書王德芳，魏學智，周書楷等均赴車站迎迓，張氏至部中晤見王外長後，即返邸休息，渠健康業已大好，日內即將開始辦公。據氏語本報記者，渠離美返國時，美國朝野對大局關切之情日益緊張，此際國會已行復會，情况想更熱烈，對國際與國內諸項問題諒多討論。美國物價雖云較前高漲，然國民平均收入，仍可滿足衣食所需，生活程度並未低落，可稱行有餘力，物價問題並不足影響重大事項之決策。關於美國對華態度，一般均極友善，馬歇爾曾宣布之援華數字及業經擬訂之方案，均美政府主動提出，且得國會兩院有力份子支持，如更能對我國現况多所了解，各方一致企望之結果，當不難　得。張氏盛　華僑在美國，夏威夷，菲律賓各地之奮鬥成績，彼等事業才能之表現，已　得中外人士交口稱通。按張氏係隨王外長赴美出席聯大會，嗣以牙症留美就醫，最近始搭「美琪」輪返國。</p>
<h3>滇緬邊界開始勘測</h3>
<p>〔中央社昆明六日電〕內政部疆界勘測隊一行，由方域司傳司備前往滇緬邊界實地勘測。數日準備工作，業已就緒，今晨八時，分兩隊出發，一隊向南，一隊向北，分赴龍陵，耿馬，鎭康，潞西，瑞　，　川，盈江，蓮山，騰衝等九縣工作，並將往高良坡，松南山等區域。傳司長原擬率隊親往，　因京中要公待理，現留昆候機返京。</p>
<h3>處理日賠償問題　三强間並無密約　美國務院發言人聲稱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕國務院發言人今日招待記者時，有人間以共和黨參議員諾蘭德昨致副國務卿洛維特一函，要求說明美，英，蘇三國間是否有密約准許蘇聯取得日本大批工廠設備事，政府方面有何意見。該發言人答稱：「絕無其事」，並謂日本機器指定作爲初步賠償之百分之三十中，蘇聯無份。關於分配日本賠償問題，美國曾在十一國遠東委員會提出數種方案，迄未成立何種決議，美國每次提出方案，輒為蘇聯代表所反對。美國主張分配日本賠償應以戰勝日本出力最多損失最大者爲尺度。截至現在爲止，美國對此問題所行政策，盡見於向麥帥所發出之訓令。</p>
<h3>日首批賠償機器六千餘部即啓運</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕日本賠償物資我國應得第一批機器，最初抽　總數為九四四七部，　因平衡各盟國分得機器之價値及等級關係，屢經調整，最後修正爲九三九八部。此次先行接收計六五四四部，已由招商局派「海康」，「海浙」兩輪，即日駛日裝運。此項分得之機器，在當初駐日賠償及歸還物資接收委員會派專家檢騐時，以東京區爲最差，而名古屋，長崎兩區，因平均品質最爲良好，故此次先行接收之機器，以名古屋陸軍造兵廠，千種製作所，所佔百分數爲最大，其次則爲長崎，川棚海軍工廠與第廿一海軍航空工廠。</p>
<p>〔本報台北六日電〕「海浙」輪定八日離基隆駛滬轉日，載運賠償物資。</p>
<h3>九龍城居民被迫遷事　我外部提出抗議　要求港府停止强制措施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕外部代理情報司司長時昭瀛六日晚稱：關於九龍城居民被迫拆屋遷移事，外部六日曾向英駐華大使館提出抗議，並要求英大使即電香港政府，停止一切强制措施。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京六日電〕英大使館參事拉波契爾稱：「九龍事件僅爲香港政府當地之行政問題」，要求居民之撤移，無非公衆之衛生與預防火警。據未證實之報吿稱：外交部將派這新代表赴香港，前所派遣之代表均遭香港常局之拒絕。</p>
<p>〔路透社杳港六日電〕港府當周六日晨究成九龍舊城區之拆隊茅屋木屋工作，未曾再有意外事件發生，昨日開始拆屋時被捕之中國人二名，已依煽動羣衆及抗不遵從警察命令之罪，在九龍法庭提起公訴，兩被吿均還押。</p>
<h3>參與商議援華計劃　貝祖詒明日飛美　兪大維因母病延期成行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕我國應邀派遣赴美之技術顧問團兪大維，貝祖詒兩氏，頃仍在京向各有關方面搜集材料，準備携美。據貝氏左右語記者，因此行任務極爲重大，同時行期忽促，不得不愼重與有關方面獲得充分之資料，尤與金融界之接觸爲多。渠幾竟日與國行總裁張嘉璈晤商。據權威方面稱，我國所提對美貸使用計劃中，仍將以穩定金融，平抑物價等爲原則。現貝氏已決定搭乘八日中航公司由滬起飛之中美班機赴美，貝氏僅帶隨員一人，即現任中國銀行國外部經理陳長桐，陳氏定七日晨抵京協助貝氏準備資料，並定七日下午趕返上海。俞大維氏於六日晨八時半再度晋謁蔣主席請示。渠原定與貝氏同行，茲以其太夫人臥病京中央醫院，兪氏隨時前往侍奉，故延期成行。</p>
<h3>援華款項總數可能爲五億元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕消息靈通人士稱：計劃中之長期美國援華計劃之總額達七億元，然此數字中數獨立項目，無疑將大受削減。彼等表示，國務院可能最後提出五億元之數。</p>
<p>六日有跡象顯示：援華計劃之起草，一月中旬將正式開始。美；得有遠東返國之官員，如前駐滬總領事台維斯等，均接獲馬歇爾之訓令即赴華盛頓，以備諮詢，且應在一月十日前到達。目前若千部中正草擬援華之各項細則，華府一般之展望爲各項細則將在於一月十二日開始舉行之各會議中合併提出，然後加以修改。</p>
<h3>千八百萬美貸商討動用細則</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓五日合衆電〕據悉：國務院專家及中國官方人士，將於此次國會中擬定美國對華緊急援助一千八百萬美元之動用細則。會商之結果，料將就此項信用貨款下供應之種類，作具體決定，並將決定各項供應之確實比較，在緊急計劃下，至今僅有兩項物資業已確琮，一為糧食，一爲肥料。如中國方面在上述計劇之三月期限內，不能自美國獲得充分足用之糧食　則其未足之數中，料將列入石油及棉花。今年前六個月內，中國已獲食米分配額五萬八千頓，故預料緊急援助之款項一部份，將作償付半數上述食米之用。據消息靈通人士稱：國務院官員同時正就十五個月對葉長期援助計劃，擬具詳細辦法，傳所需已超過三億美元</p>
<h3>穗取締非法錢莊　漢非法錢莊猶圖掙扎</h3>

<p>〔本報漢口六日電〕漢市取締非法錢莊事，經金管局斷然執行後，該業所採要挾行動，均經當局嚴厲制止，今晨起，不法錢狀五十九家推代表赴市參議會情願，意欲另圖　扎，又金管局此次措施周密，市塲金融旣無不良影響，物價亦　趨下跌，一般　為施政上一大成就。</p>

<h3>張治中談新疆問題　政府決邀阿合買提江來京否則就近至迪化洽談亦可</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕政府對新疆問題之解　辦法，決定邀請阿合買提江蒞京一談，如不來京，即就近至迪化洽談亦可。此爲張治巾將軍六日接見本報記者時所談　張氏稱：渠返新之期尙未確定，目前正期待伊寗方面之　函，　知阿氏是否接受政府之　請來京商談，張氏認為新省問題並不嚴重，至民選省主席　其在原則上已不成問題，惟以選舉之手續及辦法尙待中央擬定公佈後始可有所遵行。張氏稱：新省縣長專員早經民選，故主席之選舉決不至有何困難，至其實現時期，則尙難確定，據推測，總在三月以後。記者復詢以外傳鮑爾漢府委可能返新競選主席，不知是否確實？張氏笑稱：此事將取決於新省之選民。又張氏日前曾普　蔣主席，記者特詢以主席最近有無對新省問過之指示？據答，無。</p>

<p>〔中央社華盛頓五日電〕美國務院今接獲聯對中國復文之副本一份。蘇聯之復文，建議參加遠東委會各國，應在限制之方式下，出席擬議中之對日預備和會。預備和會並應於本月間在中國舉行。國務院對蘇聯之照會，尙在硏究中，最近不致對此表示問題之態度，迄無改變。英政府之意見，已在去年十二月十二日致送中蘇兩國政府之照會中明白說明。</p>
<h3>津烟旅大海岸各小港　幽靈船隊夜航忙　所載貨物現尙無法獲知</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕某中國權威人士五日稱：東北蘇聯所控制各港口及華北烟台，天津間海岸各小港間，每夜有幽靈船隊往來，運載貨物，此項船隻不能證明是否係蘇聯抽有，而政府亦無法獲知所載為何物，船隻悉屬土製，大多數係巨型，且有可載貨一萬噸者，往來時均載滿貨物，由於途中島嶼星列，遂得在夜間暗中往返。「彼等永遠在夜間航行，吾人不知其所載之物，然吾人確知彼等常小泊華北海岸各點，吾人亦知回程中船艙毫無空隙」。僉信，此船隊自華北運出大豆，棉花煤斤及日人不及取去之鎢絲，至於自旅大運出之物，則中國政府自承不明。「吾人無法可知或證明是否蘇聯在接濟中共，然吾人確知華北海岸及旅大間交通　繁」。一次，船隊中有一巨型船漆有聯總標幟，然中國方面情報以爲全屬假冒。蓋權威人士對報載中共及蘇聯在東北北部舉行會議，討論由蘇聯接濟中共以槍械一事，表示不信，政府以爲，蘇聯不致公開破壞一九四五年莫斯科協定，然暗中協助中共則係另一事。蘇聯一日不公開有所舉動，中國政府一日自覺無策對付除非有確證，即使要淾聯合國調查，亦屬勞而無功，中國海軍或海岸砲隊臺採直接行動，蘇聯反嚮必甚劇烈，中國政府竭力希望少釀意外，免得造成再一次世界大戰，中國牢記　溝橋之敎訓。</p>

<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕據悉：中國政府去年曾有四高級官員赴大連·旅順視察，彼等歸來後報吿該區兵工廠—製造日本式武器及軍火，國防部至今未將該報告透露　字，然權威人士稱：政府調查團係　彥平將軍所領導，在旅大受蘇聯之嚴密監視，並不准進入工廠，然調查團由於身臨當地，故獲得確證知各工廠當時在開工中。日本在戰時即利用上述工廠供應其關東軍，調查團並稱：業獲充分證據，中共在該區受蘇聯之訓練，中國方面情報稱：各工廠至今尙在繼續開工。中國調查團報告之要點如下：「前時獲知係軍火廠之各工廠及訓練中共軍隊各中心，均由蘇聯當局禁止視察，該區全體共軍均有新製日本式軍器，其訓練則純屬蘇聯式，由外表觀察，如無制服，則中共傀儡軍及外蒙軍隊幾無法予以判別」。</p>

<h3>美國八十屆國會開幕　——美國朝野將對全世界負起榮譽的責任</h3>
<p>美國第八十屆國會，於今日開幕，杜魯門總統將以咨文送遠國會，對於英國現所面臨的若干嚴重問題，例如防制通貨膨脹，長期援助歐洲復興經濟，以及援助中國復興建國等，均將提出其體方案。預料美國國會對此，必將發生熱烈的辯論。</p>
<p>我們展望一九四八年·無論就美國的內政言，或就整價的世界大局言，均認爲將有重大決定的一年，而此決定的趨向如何，則大率可就今日開幕的第八十屈國會覘之。以美國的內政而論，總統　選就在這一年內舉行，民主共和兩黨的義爭，漸至白　化的程度。雙方對於外交政策，雖有兩黨一致的協議，但其中仍有緩急輕重之分。尤其對於如何防制通貨膨脹，以及如何避免國內經濟恐慌這些問題，兩黨的見解大不相同，幾已成為兩黨竸選宜傳的主題。將來大選的結果如何，對於美國今後內政外交的動向，自有極重大的影響。再以世界大局而言，自去歲倫敦四國外長會議不歡而散之後，世界和平的前途似乎益趨黯淡，而前日小型大會開幕，蘇聯及其附庸國家的代表又一致拒不出席，美國代表奧斯汀雖仍呼籲蘇聯合作，並保證小型大會決不削弱安全理事會的職權，但聯合國能否爲維持世界和平的有效機構，實在大成問題。美國究將如何應付當前的世界問題，不僅爲美國朝野所考慮，而且也是最爲全世界人民所關切的。這次美國國會開會，就要討論道些迫切問題，而且還要代表一萬四千萬的人民作一切必要的決策，自然格外値得我們甯切的注視。</p>
<p>美國是一個資本主義的國家，但同時是一個實行民主政治的國家。美國一方面因爲得天獨厚，使其資本主義的生產發展到登峯造極的境界，可是還在百尺竿頭，更求進步。另一方面，美國是代表自由主義的民主思想最盛行，惟恐二次大戰以後的世界仍爲他種極權勢力所籠罩，故處處要爲世界和平作有力的保障。因爲美國發展的基礎建立在世界和平與經濟繁榮之上的，不特世界動亂美國獨享太平爲不可能，就使要天下皆貧而美國獨當也不可得。歷史的事實旣可爲之明證，未來的發展也有　象可知。到了今天，美國已無孤立派立脚之點；他們朝野日夜所企求的，將不是美國的獨善其身，也不是美國的獨享太平與當庶，而是世界和平與繁榮。同樣，美國朝野日夜所憂慮的，與其說是蘇聯勢力的擴張，或愿子秘密的洩瀾，無寗說是美國可能發生的經濟恐慌。戰後美國的外交政策，以世界和平與國際合作爲基調，說得好聽些，自不無出發於悲天憫人的情懷，說得露骨些，一半也實在含有自保自救的動機。美國在，寶在是美國內在的　憂。即在杜魯門總統本人也說，美國通貨膨脹如果不能及時制止，則經濟恐慌在本年內勢必發生。所以美國政府當局，不論在內政外交上，今後將無不以此爲準繩。在內政方面，杜魯門總統主張管制工資與物價以及恢復戰時的配給制度；在外交上，則擬實行全面援外計劃。其心目中的所謂援外，在積極方面，協助歐亞各國復興建國，在消極方面，務使歐亞各國不發生經濟恐慌以免波及美國的經濟。更說得透澈些，美國在戰後如果還要維持其戰時飽和的生產景氣，必須設法使歐亞的貧乏國家均能免於饑節，均能蓄有餘力以購買美國輸出的生產品。否則各國一槪缺乏「美元」，美國工業又何能長此繁榮？</p>
<p>在一九四七年的一年裏，我們固已目諸美國政府，跨開大步，向着這個援外的目標邁進，所謂援助希土兩國的杜魯門主義，所調馬歇爾的緊急援歐計劃，均已次第實行，誠可謂美國救人救己的英明打算。但是，這些計劃在去年尙在開始的階段，而且祇限於歐洲一隅，反而把足以構成世界亂源的亞洲忽視了。不僅援華計劃遲遲未能實現，而且以反共爲骨幹的杜魯門主義也尙未推行及於亞洲，使站在反對共產黨極權政治農前綫的四萬五千萬人民，對於美國政策的統一性，深深地感覺到懷疑。這次國會開幕，據路透社合衆社的報道，杜魯門總統咨文將提出三僮美元的援華計劃，其內容如何，戴至執筆爲止，猶不得而知，但按之我國政府的準備，已派遺交通部長渝大維與前任中央銀行總裁貝祖詒二氏前往華府，俾就我國金融經濟交通軍事之一般現狀，向美國國會提供資料，並可供美國　會　員隨時諮詢，可見美國援華的重點，當不外協助我　改善經濟及國内交通建設。</p>
<p>美國一般人士對於戰後中國在遠東所處地位的重要，本來均有相當的認識，尤其是杜魯門總統與馬歌爾國務卿，深知欲維持遠東和平，則非有一個强大，統一，和平，而民主的中國不可。但是也有少數人認識不淸遠東局勢的嚴重性，忽視了中國在遠東所處地位的重要，不時發表不切實際的言論，阻撓美國援華計劃的實行。因爲美國是一個極民主的國家，美國共產黨自易爲「中共」張目，以淆亂美國一般人的視聽。所以在美國國會開幕行將討論援華問題之際，我們誠懇的要請美國國會議員以及全國朝野人士，大家平心靜氣地想一想，戰後的世界已變成了什麼世界？今日的遠東已是什麼局面？</p>
<p>世界大戰已經停止了兩年多，而對生要敵國的和約猶未簽訂，甚至還未起草，這是什麼怪現象！成功湖雖爲聯合國倉義的吉祥之地，而聯合國會議至今卻距離「成功」之路似乎愈遠，道又是什麼怪現象！中蘇條約雖在莫斯枓簽訂了兩年多，　國民政府還因爲共匪有外力背景的後援，不能和平順利的接收整個東北，東北的戰火中卻有日本人朝鮮人蒙古人……之類替共匪帮兇，這更是什麼怪現象！美國前在抗戰時期爲全世界民主國家的兵工廠，現在恢復和平時期，更應該是全世界民主國家的大護法。總之一句話，在這個民主與極權，建設與破壞，人性與反人性的兩種力量的鬥爭中，不諭在全世界任何一地區，——在歐洲或在中國，美國今天均有挺身而出，義不容辭的榮譽責任。美國本屆國會討論援歐計劃與援華計劃，我們都認爲就是美國朝野表示負起他們的榮譽責任的最好機會。徐水西方激戰終宵匪遺屍盈野</p>

<h3>日政局動盪不寗　片山遲命將取决於社會黨大會全農派結黨運動首次遭遇阻力</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京六日電〕日本政局現以本年度　算之編製，平野前農相之整肅問題，以及十六日行將舉行之社會黨大會等事件爲中心而更趨動議。蓋去年第一屆國會閉幕後之片山內閣，一方面固由西尾與蘆田外相之個人交涉，成立以民主黨案爲中心之石炭國家管理法案，而使社民兩黨關係表面上趨於議和，但另方面以和田爲中心而推進之所謂「經濟安定本部案」，在一千八百圓基準工資一點，即與片山意見鑿枘，隨之決定平野農相後任之際，由於協同黨之反對，而中山野溝繼任，致使社會黨左派採取黨內之野黨立劣，而加深其惡劣環境。片山雖強調在無媾和會議以前，內閣不致絲毫變動，然實際之動搖早已天始，何況尙有外來之保守勞農新黨運動之積極化等等因素，使片山　不下臺，亦必須有改變政策之必要。因此在十六日舉行之社會黨大會上之動向，殊堪注目，亦可謂決定片山內閣運命之第一關。</p>

<p>首席檢察官季楠質問柬條是否曾犯道德上及法律上之罪，東條怒聲答謂：「余認爲余並未犯罪，余且認爲余所採取之行動皆爲正當而合法者。」季楠復追問：「如將汝開釋則汝是否將與舊日同僚再度採取與往日相同之行動？」東條尙未及回答，法庭即不准季楠提出此問題。東條對於使溥儀這滿氏國傀儡皇帝一舉，頗為懊悔。彼承認溥儀爲人奸惡，當時實欠缺遠見。柬條並稱，彼獲悉溥儀出庭作證後，對溥儀之任何言論皆不置信。東條復再度爲日皇申辯，而將一切過去歸咎於其本人。彼謂日皇始終願望和平，縱戰事殆不可免時，日皇之態度仍爲如此。日皇係勉強接受東條及次本營之意見者。</p>
<h3>審訊東條旁聽券每張售價五百圓</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕東條比好萊塢女星桃樂賽拉摩更有號召力。遠東國際法庭的日本人旁聽劵入座劵約兩百張，外交部方面免費發給列隊索取的人，但轉入黑市。每張售五百圓。國際法庭上下午各開庭一次，共六小時，看東條受審的代價為一千圓，但日人的旁聽席上還是常常客滿。</p>

<h3>繁華上海市中　出現原始人類生活　半裸其身穴居野食天寒地凍待哺嗷嗷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕數千年前原始人類穴居野食之生活，竟在二十世紀物質享受高度發展之上海市區中出現。南市南火車站舊址附近，戰時受砲火摧毀，迄今創痍未復，遍地垃圾糞草，一片荒凉。近有外地流亡來滬難民一二百人麕集該處，除一部份用稱草泥土搭成低矮之棚屋以蔽風雨外，大部份難民則就原來車站月台地點挖地穴而居。</p>
<p>月台殘跡今已蕩然無存，僅見凹凸不平之隆起土堆及若干水泥殘塊而已。難民即就此處土堆挖穴爲家。洞穴大小不一，小者僅能容身，大者可入二三人，高度皆僅及半身，故須匍匐出入。穴內除舖以若千稀疏之稻草外無常物，其潮濕陰暗自不待言，如遇雨水冲降，慘狀　可想像矣。</p>
<p>穴居難民均呈半裸狀態。彼等大都來自安徽災區，抵滬後在市區求乞爲警察所驅逐，現每日僅能在穴居附近拾取菜邊雜物等充飢。不久以前，曾有某校學生前往發放若干寒衣及米糧，故現時彼等見有衣冠整齊之人物經過時，即以爲係前往放賑者而苦苦哀求，深望當局予以救濟收容。（附圖爲半身尙在穴中之難民，本報攝）</p>

<h3>市民大學　爲廣州社會敎育　開闢一條新蹊徑</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州四日訊〕廣州的「市民大學」，開課有一個多月了，這不單是廣州敎育上的一個創舉，而且像這樣的敎育機構，恐怕在全國也不多見。這所「大學」，並不像敎育部立案的普通大學，它的修業期間僅是六個月，入學祇需報名，不用經過考試，而畢業後也沒有學士位的給予，所以道所雖然名爲「大學」，它的性質實在是一個綜合性的學術講座吧了。</p>
<p>促進社會敎育養成硏究風氣</p>
<p>這所「大學」主辦者是穗市敎育局，局方對各項敎育的推進，可謂不遺餘力，如市立各中小學校，恢復已達戰前數字，而且所收容學生超出了戰前三分之一，這可說有了相當的成續，同時，學校敎育也可算是達到穩定的階段，所以他爲求平衡發展，便　而致力於社會敎育方面。除了民敎館，圖書館，博物館等早已成立，其餘如國民體育委會，廣播擂台，　化敎育　　處等，亦已先後恢復或設立。最近，爲了提高市民智識水準，促進社會敎育，養成硏究風尙，便適庫社會環境的需要，而創辦這所「市民大學」。</p>
<p>沒有院不分系共設廿二講座</p>
<p>這所「大學」院」，也不分「系」，它祗有二十二個講座，就是：國父遺敎，生席言論，新生活，國際問題，黨政問題，憲政問題，社會問題，經濟問題，衛生敎育，社會敎育，兒童問題，婦女問題，靑年問題，市政問題，華僑問題，邊疆問題，時事述評，中國歷史，中國文化史，外國史綱，哲學，新聞學等。每一講座聘有中外名流負責主講，學生可以自由選讀那幾個講座。</p>
<p>每晚七時上課每週舉行晚會</p>
<p>至於校內的組織，祗有一個教育委員會，主任委員由祝局長兼任，敎育局社會敎育科長郭經綸，市立師範校長任學明都是委員。他們上課時間，是每晚七時至九時半，每星期舉行新生活晚會一次，以資調劑。現在學生有四百餘人，這裏包括有失學靑年，公務員，商店店員，以及一般好研究學習的社會各界人士，所以他們的學識程度，自然是參差不齊的了。</p>
<p>本期辦有成效一定續辦幾所</p>
<p>據祝局長語記者：這種一市民大學」的組織，在歐洲好幾個國家很盛行的，不過，在中國，還沒有舉辦過。去年國府孫副主席返穗，曾談起他前長穗市時，便擬設立這種「大學」，並指示立即籌辦，所以這所「市民大學」，可以說是秉承孫副主席的指示而成立的。他又說：這消息發出後，報名的人非常踴躍，現在有四百多人，故先行開學，其實報名的人還有許多，因爲地址關係不能容納太多人，致使一部份熱心學習的人士失望，深感遺憾！最後他還表示：如這一期辦得有成續，將來一定繼續多辦幾所。</p>
<p>在敎育問題嚴重的今天，這種「市民大學」的舉辦能够有成績的話，相信不單對敎靑有了莫大的帮助，就對整個社會風氣，多少也會有良好的影響。（特派員梁風）</p>

<h3>錢維清借槍擊蘇靑學生緣何自相殘殺</h3>
<p>〔本報武進六日訊〕本邑於元旦隔夜，傍晚六時左右，在暮色蒼茫中，在西門城脚下發生一學生槍殺學生案。此事頗曲折離奇，案情以年首停止辦公，至今尙未判明，經過情形如次：繳有私立柏　中學高二學生蘇靑，平日在校並不認眞讀書，據稱參加某種組織，不時在外開會，卅一日下午一時，邀同同學少年岳峯，暨西郊中學之錢維淸，無錫人，年十八歲，至西門大　電影看　完畢，至懷德橋十字路口各散。下午六時三刻，錢維淸又應約至覓　橋小學門口看蘇靑，未値，在大街兜轉，途遇蘇靑與岳峯，於是錢偕蘇至西門遊玩，岳峯別去，走至西門城脚下，邊走　談之際，錢維淸清然舉出借自蘇靑之手槍，向蘇靑開放一槍，　巾蘇之下顎及　部，蘇啊　一聲，例臥於地，錢即逸去。蘇經行人舁送武進醫院救治，尙能言語，即將經過陳述警局，當將錢在西部中學拘獲，幷搜出土造手槍一支，彈四發。經審訊及檢騐結果，認錢維淸有預謀殺人嫌疑，即解送城防部法辦。惟據蘇靑供與錢維情平時爲極好友，錢維淸供在城脚南首忽見前面城牆上跳下二個人，這時蘇靑走在前面，我對跳下的人很驚駭，就急忙出手槍，誤觸保險，子彈出膛，誤繫蘇靑。出事後，驚慌不知所措，就砲掉了，平時與蘇感情很好云云。現被擊傷之蘇靑，面部腫脹，子彈尙未取出，一說係三角　愛，激起殺意，究竟是何實情，尙待審訊。</p>
<h3>無錫法院派員　覆騐姦殺案　喉間一刀身首幾斷屍旁有缸冀圖滅跡</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫五日訊〕去年十二月廿七日晨，縣屬蕩口區鴻　里鎭居民蔡近山，因與鄒福渭之妻王氏通姦，被用鐵棍擊死。案發後兇手鄒福渭夫婦，即向當地警察局自首，移送地檢處偵訊，翌日，即派員下鄉臉屍，檢驗結果，發現疑點甚多，此事似不類　殺，而與兇手口供亦多不符。地檢處爲爲重計，復指派檢察官朱國華率同宗檢驗員，於前日下鄉覆驗。經朱氏詳細査勘出事地點，及訊問死者家屬及鄰居後，已發現可疑之處甚多，顯非　殺，而兇手更有毁屍滅跡之企同。</p>
<p>處處血痕</p>
<p>緣犯罪處所，在鴻聲弄內，該屋共有七造進深，每造均有天井隔開，平日出入均走腰門　弄，兇手住最後一造。檢察官踏堪結果，發現　所住之屋子，前天井中，有斑斑血跡，客堂內牆壁上及地上，亦均有血痕。屍身橫臥於鄒之臥室內，地上流有大量血液，已擬結成塊。頭頗除被亂刀砍傷外，頭項聞復被砍二刀，喉嚨間一刀尤深，約有三寸餘，且創口甚整齊，身首幾將分離，屍旁置有中型水缸一只。</p>
<p>夫妻自首</p>
<p>檢察官檢驗畢，即在屋內傳訊屍妻蔡華氏，同居小根等，據施供稱：上月　七晨九時許，施外出泡水歸家，見腰門已閉上，即猛力敲擊，約歷十分鐘始開，當入門後，即見鄒福渭滿身血汚，鄒妻王氏，正在揩拭地面上血跡，施知已出事，即隨血跡步至客堂，突遙見鄒之房門口有屍足一只，露於房門外，乃駭極奔出報吿鎭公所，鄒亦知罪責難逃，即偕妻外出，向警局自首云云。繼據屍妻供稱：乃夫生前與鄒並無重大寃仇，僅因細故吵架一次，然亦不致謀殺。又蔡生前會患有瘋癱病，現已痊愈，惟氣力仍弱等語。</p>
<p>砍屍移屍</p>
<p>朱氏傳訊畢，繼在室內巡視一週，並將當時情形，摘錢卷內，所有證件，亦一併帶院存案。朱返城後，即提訊在押之兇手鄒福渭夫婦。鄒猶堅稱蔡因與其妻通姦，憤而在房內擊斃，後經檢察官翻覆敲擊，　加　訊，並將踏堪情形吿知，鄒始承認在天井中砍斃後移屍房內，惟死因仍堅持係姦殺。鄒妻王氏之口供，與乃夫相問，惟稱並未帮兇等語。訊畢，仍還押，現此案以事出離奇，轟傳全縣，其真相尚待繼續偵查後始可分　。</p>

<h3>柏林大學新校長盼我國派遣學生</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員柏林航訊〕斷坦殘壁，彈痕累累之柏林大學，正步向新生之途。記者廿二日晨得蕭雲來博士之介紹，驅車訪問新校長德希Dersch敎授，據談：柏林大學現己恢復十個學院，醫，法，哲學，數理，經濟，神，獸醫，農，森林，及敎育學院。</p>
<p>德希敎授稱：柏林大學於戰爭期間，遭受極嚴酷之焚燒與破壞，除房屋毁壞外，最可惜者爲柏大之藏書。德希敎授原爲勞工法之著名學者，渠稱：「即以勞工法之書籍爲例，雖經戰後多方搜集，己不及原有者萬分之一。」</p>
<p>渠又稱：目前蘇聯軍政當局甚有興趣於柏林大學之重建，蘇駐德軍政府，允許於一年內全部修復柏大之房舍。希望明年（一九四八）秋季開學之時，與戰前狀態一般，其經費則由俄方期分供給。</p>
<p>談到敎授問題，德希校長稱：昔日參加納粹或傾向納粹之敎授，大半己被驅逐，僅有極少數在學術上有特殊硏究者，仍留大學工作，彼等或仍爲敎授，或改稱硏究員，但數目極少。目前全校學生總數約五千至六千人，敎授，副教授，講師總數約一百五十人左右。</p>
<p>德希校長强調「學術國際化」，歡迎中國學生仍能本以往作風，源源來柏林大學求學，若能大批派遣來德更佳。渠個人之東方學生甚多，渠過去常深感中國學生較日本學生爲可愛。渠稱：當渠於一九三三年以前任敎柏大時，某中國學生畢業返國，臨別辭行時，黨袖出其聽課時之筆記本，因此，渠對於中國學生「動學」之印象，無時或忘。</p>
<p>柏林大學現在蘇軍區，受蘇聯之控制極深。外　學生入學，例須經蘇軍政府核准，但從未有無故拒絕者。德希敎授於一九三三年以前，爲柏大名敎授，因思想左傾，希特勒登台後被逐。最近　斯屈洛克斯，出任柏林大學之校長。</p>

<h3>敎部令各級教育機關　注意學童營養問題　免使影響整個民族健康</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局頃奉教育部訓令，略謂兒童正當發育成畏時期，除需要營養維特日常生活外，更賴以供給生長及發育之原料，關係至為切要。抗戰期間，物價高漲，生活困難，國民營養缺乏，抗戰勝利後，以戰時破壞，一切建設，恢復不易，加之奸匪作亂，民不聊生，國民營養仍感不足，影響個人一生及整個民族康健至鉅，故學校對於學童之營養亟應特別加以注意。關於學童營養問題，各國極爲重視，竟有由學校供給學童飲食補充營養，或由學校向當地慈善團體或學生家長捐募經費辦理，並由敎育行政委員會負責支配，聘請專家料理其事，成績斐然。我國國民經濟向不發達，敎育經費尤屬拮据，學校旣不能負担學童膳食或補充營養，多數學童家長亦無力擔負，為求促進此項重要設施，各級教育機關應竭力設法督導。辦理小學實施公民訓練，　舉行學童家長集會時，應就經濟環境下，因時因地因人，施以各種日常生活所必需之營養知識，如食物之分配與選擇等，使學童及其家長知所注意。如兒童自帶午膳到校，學校備膳堂及廚房，為兒童服務云。聞市教局頃已轉飭各校遵照。</p>

<p>郝更生致請</p>

<p>自由談我看日本人  靖文　　日本投降不過兩年餘，而且至今尙未正式簽訂和約，可是關於日本的消息，又逐漸在中外報紙上以重要的地位出現了。關心「日本問題」的人，也一天天多了起來。　　過去西洋人曾一度視日本是東方的一個「謎」國，日本人的性格更難呌人捉摸。穿得花蝴蝶一般的日本女人，溫順得猶如一隻馴貓，而日本的男人，却又有經殺人常做競賽取樂的。但你說日本的男子個個野蠻，日本的女子個個溫順，却又未必。譬如日本的小商人，對顧客的恭順態度，就不輸於上海的猶太商人，而日本的女子中，也曾有過把情人慘殺以滿足獨佔慾的殘酷行爲。　　其實日本人並沒有甚麼不可思議或神秘處。日本的國家過去也許帶有幾分神秘色彩，但這祗是日本的封建歷史背景以及她的國敎神道敎所交織成的罷了。將神道敎與國政分離，將封建的背景加以淸算，日本就是日本，你就再不會覺得她有什麼神秘了。　　不過這件工作不是短時期內所能完成，而其是否能完成，才是今天的眞正日本問題。　　但日本民族確有一個特點，即是善於投機取巧，說得好聽些，就是適應環境的力量極强。這也許是日本民族的物理生存條件所造成。因爲日本是一個地小物不豐的小國，要不是善於適應環境，就不能有發展。因此在她的民族性格上就養成了善於投機取巧，更發展而成强取豪奪的特性。　　日本人的氣量奇小，而對外的佔有悠則極大，就是此種性格的表現。在閉關政策時代，日本人一而嚴格排斥一切外來的東西，同時則組織所謂倭寇，向中國及朝鮮海岸作偸刦行爲；但經美國的大砲轟開日本門戶之後，她又一變而一切都摹仿西洋，因而產生了明治維新時代；蘇聯革命及中國大革命後的十年左右，日本的思想界與政黨方面，曾一時發生過左傾份子大活躍的現象，但法西斯主義與納粹主義興起之後，日本又跟着跳下水去。道一切雖是日本政治上的冒險，但同樣是證明了日本民族善於投機取巧。　　今天的日本雖已受過原子炸彈的洗禮，可是看看最近日本人的言行，却又不禁令人懷疑日本人究有幾分覺悟。也許我們不能責備日本人，因爲世事雖多幻變，而可令日本利用爲投機資本的條件則仍舊存在。而日本的武士道精神又是講究復仇的。要是日本人眞是抱着這種心理，那麼眞正的日本悲劇，恐怕還在後面！　　如果日本人能從他們的花道，茶道，能樂，歌舞伎，櫻花，溫泉等特色方面發展，成爲一個東方的瑞士，用他們潔凈精巧的「障子」來隔絕一切非份之想，則不僅是日本之福，也是世界和平之福。從一個島國而完成過征服世界覇業的，歷史上僅有過一個英帝國，但現在的英國也早在急流勇退了。此後的世界，恐怕不再會有這樣的奇蹟，聰敏如日本人，還是多做些「綠化」日木的工作吧。賀年片  柯曼　　年假開始了，得幾日休閒，可是想到無錢可化，便覺興意索然；無聊地打開抽屜，翻翻孩子送來的一堆賀年片，彷彿看到一張張天眞的笑臉，一雙雙肥白的小手，有的是大方地行了禮送上，也有丟下含羞逃跑的，尤其低年級的孩子更可愛，他們有些不寫名字，也有一個人給你兩三張的。——翻着翻着，心頭浮起一點溫馨，這是粉筆生在者特有僅有的安慰。　　勞作和圖畫敎師很早利用年節施行設計敎學，指導孩子們自製賀年片，結果，一張不實用，因爲送者受者都嫌不飄亮，不鄭重，而且，有一個孩子吿訴我，買一張白卡片紙，要比賀年片貴一倍以上。一側文具店夥計客氣地向我打招呼，說：「五千多張賀年片，都承貴校小朋友銷完的！」啊！五千張，以每張五百元來算，該是怎樣一個數字啊！　　國語敎師也在作文課裏敎學寫賀年信，但孩子們根本不知道賀年的意義，寫文章又是乏味的事，雖然「紅梅辭歲，白雪迎春——」材料提供了一大串，還是沒有用，甚至無從批改，結果，自己賀了自己。　　孩子們向家長「順利」或「哭泣」地拿錢買賀年片趕時風，有的孩子因買得少，竟也不得不「揀廟燒香」，要分出「大小」，「好壞」來表示人情的厚薄了。　　然而，拿到上好賀年片的敎師，過一時便漸漸忘了，未必就會給孩子什麼好處，但因爲未收到賀年片而不滿意的敎師，却就有些人向無罪的孩子存下了惡感，找麻煩，諷刺，扣分數，也許還會偸偷地「搥爆栗」……　　在純潔，天眞的孩子們的天堂中，賀年片竟使他們學習了勢利和虛僞！「獨木橋」  王百里　　山陰朱瓣香先生，才藻絕俗，嘗於秋夜枕上，戲詠「聲」字，用「獨不橋」體，作「醉太平」調十二解，殊有別情。詞云：「高槐怒聲，修葺恨聲，蕭騷葉墮堦聲，破窓兒紙聲。沈沈鼓聲，寥寥磐聲，小樓橫笛聲聲，接長街柝聲。鄰猧吠聲，池魚躍聲，啾啾獨鳥棲聲，竹籠鵝鴨聲。蟲娘給聲，狸奴趕聲，墻根蟋蟀吟聲，又空梁鼠聲。重門喚聲，層樓應聲，村夫被酒歸聲，聽雙扉闔聲。蘭窗剪聲，芸窗讀聲，孀闔少婦吞聲，雜兒啼乳聲。喁喁暱聲，喃喃夢聲，吚唔小女嬌聲，有耶娘惜聲。盤珠算聲，機絲織聲，松風隱隱濤聲，是茶爐沸聲。風鳴瓦聲，人離坐聲，窗盤叩　速聲，想殘烟管聲。床鈎觸聲，窓環蕩聲，　前正馬飛聲，似丁常珮聲。空堂颯聲，虛廊淅聲，花陰濕土蟲聲，作爬沙蟹聲。遙聲近聲，長聲短聲，孤衾挨到鷄聲，盼晨鐘寺聲。」（見冷廬雜識卷四）憶「廠甸」（下）  季永　　我雖是北平人，可是手頭一本講舊京風土的書也沒有，只記得震鈞的天咫偶聞，更早的劉侗帝京景物略，對這裏都有很好的文字，閒園鞠農的一歲貨聲，富察敦崇的燕京歲時記，更寫得切近民間。恰好淸代的三種又都是旗人之作，文中所寫盛袞之感，大可引人深思。這代表着長期民俗的廟市約分爲三大部分，自和平門至南新華街的南北一綫，爲書畫集中地，自海王村至楊梅竹斜街東西一帶爲食品玩具及吃茶遊賞的巾心，文化商塲專賣高貴玉器，除達官貴人及姨太太闊妓女外，少有涉足，殆可稱爲另一中心也。　　書並不便宜，因爲也是內行所設的攤子。畫則以假的爲正宗，眞的可遇而不可求。張飛的大作「美人」，關雲長的法書，這裏都會碰到的，你可別上當以爲「與古人遊」了。賣畫的照例比書攤神氣，搭着很長很大的　蓆棚，不像書攤　終日吃西北風。李慈銘越縵堂日記及翁文恭日記中都有許多「閱廠」的紀載，勝朝的文士風流，如今也很難說了，作官的不知在鑽什麽，大學敎授在聽着九十萬一包的麵粉打冷戰。劉半農在此得「何典」，好像也是三代以上之事。總之，這不但須有錢，而且必須「有閒」，踱來踱去，可以終日不獲一，可是一旦有了「詭遇」，一朝而獲十也不稀奇。早年讀諸家的信札日記，常常可以讀到和疑古玄同，劉牛農，馬隅卿等人角賽所得的談話，這曾令嘗呆子神往的。　　且說遊賞與飲食。我眞不懂，那麽多人都在　什麼，大約也不出水滸傳所說，「車馬往來人看人」罷？這一看不要緊，朱仝丟了小衙內，而我的經驗，至少有三四次遇到家屬　了找尋失人的黃旗，敲着銅　在尋覓丟了的孩子。不過，說是無意義，意義也就在此，我們所要的是歲時伏臘一點熱鬧，一點鬆弛，有點新聞，有點變故，也仍舊是太平景象，明朝人詩句云：「花無桃李非春色，人有笙歌是太平」，實在有點俗得雅。海王村公園中央有吃茶的攤子，用木板搭着台，四面並無遮蔽，居高臨下，一覽無餘，你聽，那賣輕氣球的尖銳放氣聲，和賣糖葫蘆的吆喝聲。糖葫蘆是大得出奇，不爲的吃，專爲了玩，這倒也與進廠甸的心情是一致的。每一輛回家的洋車上若不捆幾支抹着白色飴糖的這東西或是一個嘩嘩響的秫稽作的風車，總不够意思。以前我非常討厭孩子們買了風車回來，插在門窗上吵得四鄰不安，如今是「此情可待成追憶」，反而心嚮往之了。　　還有更爲小孩所寵愛的東西呢，便是木刀槍，鬼臉及琉璃喇叭。帝京景物略有一段記這些東西，（未必是廠甸，大約各處正月廟會皆有之）眞是好極了，只好請你去査一查，我是沒法引用。吃的當然最流行「蘇造肉」，把肉和小型的面燒餅煮在一起，說是蘇造，例不見得有吳門的餘風，也就不必考査其來源了。還有一種「艾窩窩」，以　熟糯粉隨時裏糖　賣之，滿洲點心也，雖不好吃，而其名大有意思，去年南京也有售者，橘生淮北則爲枳，無論如何是不對口味的。你更可以冲一盌八寳茶湯，或是一盌道地西湖藕粉。在茶座上「白相」半日，也不過五六角錢吧。自然，這是十五年前的話。　　北平那有一件不是可愛的？從高大的前箭門樓以至小的白灰火爐。溫暖，有人情，有北方的博大寬和而又有南方的明麗輕情。但這是北方呀。匪離這兒三千里的北方呀，假使此地有寒流的襲擊，北平就得裂膚墮指，堅冰在　。聽說今年竟沒有煤，即使有，也升不起火，在寒冷包圍中的舊京不是値得懷念，而是値得憑弔了，沒有消息自北方來，竟不敢斷定年年開市的廠甸今年尙能「循俗」否？　　離婚的理由　　在伊里薩斯，法官批准了八十三歲奧斯本夫人的離婚要求，因爲她每次出門後回家，她的丈夫都堅持要知道她究竟和誰在一起消磨時光。　　美國意利諾斯州，有一個女子在法院裹控訴她的丈夫，要求離婚的原因是她和他在路上走時，有一次他讓她走在靠馬路的一邊。　　美國卡里斯頓城，一個女子要求和她丈夫離婚，理由是她的丈夫用脚踢她，結果她敗訴了，因爲法官發現那男子祗有一腿（志成）。朱子家訓之疑  鄭過宜　　朱柏　以理學自命，其治家格言尤爲世所誦習，流俗有不知朱用純者，而少有不能舉朱柏廬之名者也。（柏廬名用純，空致一，柏廬其號也。）然柏廬於治家格言外，其他文字，頗不多概見，至其生平，則知者尤鮮。據歸玄恭（莊）致邱顯若書云：「朱家壽文承命作跋，弟素不能虛譽，不過道其實，但措辭略少蘊藉耳。何意致一遂積怨深怒至此也。前聞其逢人輒愬，固已怪之，亦置之不足較，昨遇於季重兄家，弟整衣冠將與之揖，彼不不禮而極口肆駡，弟見其勢猛氣强，非復可理喩者，走避之，猶追駡不已，異哉。」又云：致一粗知文義，欲自附於淸流，一旦忽與歸玄恭爲難，咄咄怪事，且昨日情狀，竟類市儈無賴所爲，當年以發表叔醇謹家風，一變至此，可歡！」玄恭與顧炎武（亭林）齊名，時有歸奇顧怪之目，蓋淸節之士也，其述柏廬如此，當可徵信，是柏　之面且盡見，殆　滯而又剛愎之俗儒，與其治家格言溫厚之旨，殊不相似。柏　顧以此文埀名不朽，至今流傳弗已，豈非奇事？治家格言亦有稱之爲朱子家訓者，　年嘗有人於報章撰文，涉及朱子家訓，以家訓冠以朱子，遂認爲晦翁（朱熹）所作，一時騰笑衆口，羣起　摘，其人自承疏忽，卒無辭答辯。然吾閱「朱子大全」，卷未實載有此文，惟其月爲「居家要言」，不謂之爲「治家格言」與「朱子家訓」也。晦翁文集不必竄襲柏廬之作以增重，果誤入邪？抑柏廬攫自朱子大全以欺世盜名？頗疑莫能釋，朱子大全爲淸代儒生所必涉覽之書，而自來未見有是正之者，斯亦可異。附此質之淹博考古之士，亦有以怯吾惑否？惜前人不知朱子大全之載有此文，致爲人指斥，　恧而已，不敢更置一喙，思之亦頗可噱。但吾亦終不信朱柏廬之無行至此，矧剿晦翁之作以爲己有，其附於道學者尤不應爾也。談口香糖  毛毅　　美國人與口香糖的關係，可說和中國人與瓜子一樣的密切。美國所以變成了一個嚼口香糖的國家，主要的由於三個人：湯姆士·阿常姆斯－他把「奇可利」（Chicle一種似樹膠的物質）做成條糖；約翰，柯爾剛－他把香料放入奇可利中；另外一人是小威廉·李格蒙－他把香糖放在美國人的嘴裏。　　阿當姆斯是一個業餘的發明家，在一八六九年的某一天，他在傑西域的一家藥房中聽到一個小姑娘要買一些石蠟樹膠去嚼，他便對橡皮糖發生了興趣。阿當姆斯回憶到他曾經看見過被放逐在司推坦島上的墨西哥的獨裁者山塔，安那撕裂一片片的奇可而大嚼，於是他和他的兒子當晚便開始用他先前原欲用作一種橡皮代替品的奇可利硏究；他們把奇可利放在熟水中軟化，搓揑，然後　成二百個小丸。這點出品以每粒一分錢的定價放在藥房內出售，很快的就傾銷一光。　　不過阿當姆斯父子所做出來的「口香糖」實在祗能稱之爲「嚼用的奇可利」，因爲它們是毫無滋味的，確是「味同嚼蠟」。加香料的約翰·柯爾剛原是路易士維爾城的一個藥商，他把「香脂」放在奇可利巾，命名爲「太妃糖」，生意亦甚興隆。　　但是，大規模的製造和推銷口香糖要以小李格萊爲鼻祖。他在一八九二年將推銷術帶入口香糖。在經濟蕭條的一九〇七年，他居然還決定「在廣吿上投資一百萬美金。他當不時要說沒有百萬金元，就是二十五萬塊錢也沒有，但是，他用賒帳的方法做廣吿，不久，李格萊的廣告招貼就貼在全美的每一輛街車上了。一年的功夫，他的口香糖銷售額從十七萬元增加到一百三十四萬五千元。他的公司自創辦迄今，售（出的口香糖有一千一百三十多億條，所付的紅利有一百八十五億餘元美金。　　美國人消耗口香糖的數量，在一九一四年是平均每人每年嚼三十九根，到一九二五年這個平均數增加到一百根，而在今天則已超過一百三十根。雖然其他國家的人民也有嚼口香糖的，但是，美國的消耗量比全世界其他國家的消耗量的總和還大六倍。數年以來，「李格萊」（一譯留闌香糖」）「別趣納」和「美國奇可利」三大口香糖公司賺了三億三千多萬元－他們所賣的全都是一分錢一根的東西，不過成本平均却祗有半分錢。　　美國人何以特別喜歡嚼口香糖呢？菲利浦·李格萊曾於一九三二年懸賞徵求答案，時間先後有三年之久。應徵者雖多，但是他們所列舉的理由大多數都是抄自李格萊在當時所特別强調的廣吿詞句。直到如今尙難發掘新的理由。大多數用的，從「增加效率」和「振興工業」到「解除厭煩」與「保持嘴唇年靑」，樣樣都有。立志  仲明　　一般人都喜歡把元旦這一天作爲自己「新生」的日子，而在新歲開始的第一天，爲自己立下了「宏願」。把一切美麗的希望都寄托在這一個「開頭」的日子，希望從元旦起，開始過「新」的生活；做「新」的工作；創「新」的事業。什麽都要使牠革「新」一下使這一年不再如往年般似夢幻地過去，而能够達到自己的「宏願」。可是曾幾何時，他們的希望又幻滅了，一切「新」的都照例變成舊的了；於是自己又埀頭喪氣說：「今年又完了，待明年再開始罷！」他們的心目中彷彿祗有在元旦這一天纔提得起他們的精神，祗有從元旦做起的一切工作才有價値似的，所以寫日記從元旦開始；鍜鍊身體也要從元旦開始；讀書做事也無不以元旦開始爲可貴。元旦過去了，精神煥散了，一切又停頓了下來。　　我以爲這是莫大的錯誤。因爲，元旦固然是一個可以立志的日子，但苟欲立志，並不一定要在元旦。從元旦開始的工作可以有輝煌的成功，但不是從元旦開始的一切工作也同樣可以獲致偉大的成就。一個最普通最平凡的日子，祗要你肯立志，肯用堅毅不拔的精神去貫澈到底，一樣會使它成爲最有價值最有意義的一天；反之，一個有價直有意義的節目，如果你所立的「宏願」不能貫澈始終，一樣會使這可貴的日子，變得沒有絲毫的意義和價値。　　立志做事的人，決不應該選擇從那一天做起。因爲祗要你的「志」立得穩，每一個日子都可能是成功的開始。什麽時候肯下決心去開始你的工作，什麽時候便將奠下成功的基石。祗有從「現在」起便拿出力量來實踐擬的工作，才永遠不會使你失望。眞正肯立志做事的人，是決不會讓時間騙過自己許多要做的工作的。逍遙花  陳慎言　　　　第六章　如此良宵（三四）　　綺紈用　指在　上拿一個橄欖給渚齋道：「諫果回甘，你吃這個好了，我不敢給你梨吃，梨是分離，不是好兆頭。」渚齋道：「你這話太迷信了，我偏愛吃它一點，看能分離不能分離？」因用手取了一片梨，塞在嘴裏。綺紈道：「你笑我迷信，我們梨園迷信的事太多了。」說時，小王媽又走進來道：「現在已經快到三點鐘，外面又刮風。」說時向渚齋看了一眼。渚齋見說，向腕上手錶一看，果然已經二點三刻，驚道：「沒想到已徑這　晚，明天一早你就要走，我到車站送你。」綺紈道：「你還打算回去嗎？」渚齋給她一問，覺得很不好答覆，小王媽在旁揷嘴道：「外面風很大，人力車也不好僱。」綺紈道：「現在距離天亮，祗有三個鐘頭，你這時候回去，明天一早又要趕到車站，太累了，不如就在這裏和我談談。王媽，你托那隻小床放在外間屋內，沒事你先睡好了，明天我們還耍早起呢。」小工媽點點頭，向渚齋掃了一眼，含笑出去。綺紈拉住渚齋的手道：「渚！我認爲這時問是寳貴的，再過三個鐘頭，我們就要分手了！」渚齋道：「是的，你的行李都收拾好了沒有？」綺紈道：「一切行頭等等，都收拾好了，由我哥哥帶去，祗有我隨身衣服，還沒理好，現在我心裏亂雜雜的，覺得幹什麼都不好。」說着，緊握着渚齋的手。渚齋由碟內檢一粒橄欖送給綺紈，因說：「你酒喝太多了，酒能亂性，不是好東西，你以後在外面，不要再喝酒。」綺紈速連應道：「是的，是的，我這次出外，絕對不喝酒，等我回來，再和你痛飮。」說完這一句，舉起兩手搭在渚　渭上道：「你看我今天眞醉了嗎？我沒醉啊！」因含笑凝神，兩眼看在渚齋險上，渚齋見她滿面含春，星眸如醉，呼吸間微微急促噴出一股酒氣，這時兩個人的臉，凑很極近，一股脂香粉氣，撲到渚齊鼻裏，渚齋不禁如痴如醉。突然下意識裏，似在警吿他：「不耍如此，不該如此！章小姐還在那兒等你呢。」渚齋立時身子往後一退，綺紈却向他掃了一眼，立時紅雲布滿臉上，急趕到瓷臉盆邊，將龍頭一擰，嘩嘩冷水，冲滿一盆，綺紈又把一條冷手巾，放在盆內，擰了一把，向臉上兩頰上熨一熨，又擦了一把，然後對渚齋道：「你也擦一把吧！」渚齋走過去，用冷水洗一洗頭臉，立時覺得腦筋淸醒，這時綺紈已坐在沙發上，用小手絹慢慢擦着嘴角。渚齋走過去說道：「現在祗有兩個鐘頭了，你行李還沒收拾，我帮着你收拾收拾，好不奸？」綺紈道：「對！對！」立時由櫃內提了一隻手提箱出來，打開衣櫃，把應帶的衣服，呌渚齋一件一件取出，綺紈一一疊好，隨疊隨放，沒放多少件，把一隻手提箱，已裝滿了，櫃內剩下好幾件衣服，還沒裝進去。渚齋道：「你帶幾隻手提箱？」綺紈道：「我祗帶一隻呀，還有這些衣服沒裝進去，怎麼辦？現在時候太晚，不然，我呌人送給我哥哥，裝在他衣箱裏。」說時急得搓着雙手，把脚蹂得地上登登的嚮。社會服務　中報「社會服務」　過去一年的業務概况　寄萍　　〔續昨〕　慈善救濟這一年來委託我們代收捐款，或代爲宣傳的團體，也爲數不少。　寒衣運動去年春天及冬天，曾爲難民徵　寒衣及寒衣捐，直接爲難民服務。　讀者聯絡這一項工作，做得相當滿意，我們每日收到讀者來信至少五十件以上，內容非常複雜，除醫藥，法律，與敎育文化，請十餘位專家顧問解答者外，其餘必經多方研討或調査，然後直接作復，一年來發函達二千三百餘件；有的就在「讀者信箱」公開答復；計三百餘件，每天還有很多讀者，電話諮詢或來館面詢的，我們將是推誠相見，給他們滿意的答復。　　讀者意見　本報讀者每有多方面的事，付託由本欄轉致各主管當局核辦或參考的，爲數極多。　　特種事件　平時常有與「社會服務」有關的事件，只要能力所及，無不悉力以赴。綜上所述，爲大槪情形，過去一年來已在區區篇幅中，略紀梗概，想爲讀者所瞭然。我們所抱憾的，實以人力物力有限，還未盡服務之能事。但是對於本報各方面的讀者，給　　　　神上物質上種種的協助與鼓勵，我們是萬分感佩，沒齒不忘的。　　今而後，深望讀者諸君，賜予更大的協力與督敎，我們自當匪勉從事，勞怨勿辭，爲讀者服務，爲社會服務，以盡報人的天職。　　大學得獎學生　茶點費救難胞　震旦學生提議一致通過　　本報昨接上海獎學金統一審核委員會正副主委潘公展李熙謀函云：「逕啓者，查本會於三十六年十二月二十八日上午九時在市立體育館召開本市專科以上學校得獎學生第一次聯歡大會，依照收回入塲券計算，當時出席學生共計二五六八名，本會原擬發給每名茶點費二萬元，共計五千一百三十六萬元，　因震　大學醫學院得獎學生胡同增君提議，並經全體出席學生一致贊同，將該項茶點費全數捐助本市冬令救濟委員會，充作救濟難胞經費，相應檢附中國通商銀行支票一紙，計國幣五千一百三十六萬元，函請貴報査收惠予轉交木市冬令救濟委員會，並請掣據見復以憑核銷爲荷。（按）本報已將捐款照轉並函復矣。　　捐款上海市敎育會徼來本市專科以上學校得獎學生聯歡大會出席學生茶點費移助五千一百三十六萬元，劉丹園七十三萬元，徐林氏十萬元，徐雲卿十萬元，徐范氏，徐惠英，文英，榮芳，信芳，義芳各五萬元，以上共收五千二百五十九萬元，連前共計九千五百五十二萬七千七百九十元。</p>

<p>文學本世紀的英國小說  諾門·尼古爾遜作　吳靖文譯　　上海文藝作家協會主編　第六期　每逢星期三出版　　蕭伯納與威爾斯　　十九世紀的英國小說家，多數對於社會的構造是不大視爲問題的，甚至可說不大瞭解，但至世紀末，對於社會問題就產生了一種新的態度。人們開始分析社會問題了，視社會之健康與人體健康一樣，提出處方，運用，甚至外科手術等種種建議了。　　這種新態度自亦可從當時的文學界中見到。其典型人物就是蕭伯納，他打開了窗戶讓陽光進爲維多利亞時代的偏見所封鎖的滿是塵埃的室隅。不過蕭主要還是一個劇作者；講到最足代表廿世紀黎明期的小說家，恐怕應推威爾斯。威爾斯本人的幼年生活就是自我敎育的苦鬥，他設法從一家縫衣舖的長期監禁生活中逃了出來。他的能够逃脫他的命運，就是全賴他的堅志苦學，這樣才使他後來能到倫敦當一名科學敎師；後來他開始寫作時，他自然把科學視作爲人類的唯一解放者了。在一八九〇年代，人們對於自然界的現象激起了一種好奇心對將來懷着極大的憧憬，威爾斯就能把這表現之於他的許多科學狂想中。　　可是不顧這些作品怎樣的富於發明，然尙不足發揮他創造人物的天才，不足表現他當時日益重視社會問題的興趣。他因此即放棄了幻想，根據他早年生活的經騐，寫了許多偉大的滑稽小說。其中最好的兩篇是「吉潑斯」（Ripps）及「潘萊先生」（Mr.　Polly），這兩篇作品的中心人物都是服裝商。吉潑斯有一筆祖傳的財產，他的主顧都是中上層階級的人物，他在他們的影響之下，幾乎把他自己弄成了一個　　人物，最後他終於感到厭　而恢復了樸實的自我本來面目。至於潘萊先生，在一家從沒有賺過錢的商店中混了幾有半世之後，他承認是失敗了，他把他的房子放了一把火，背棄了所謂高尙　　，最後在一家鄉下小客棧中做了一名散工而始覺得安心。　　「潘萊先生」是一九一〇年出版的，後來威爾斯又寫了許多更是野心，更嚴肅的作品，但他始終未能恢復他最初的輕快精神了。他視他自己是一個記者而非藝術家，就領導他時代的思想一點言，是沒有人比他做得再多的；他的小說雖缺少藝術氣氛，然其活力却補償有餘，其最善之處可說是遠勝於今日的許多經過磨琢的小說。　　高爾斯華綏　　威爾斯的兩個同時代人——安　　·本尼脫和約翰·高爾斯華綏，也顯示了當時對於社會問題的懸念。本尼脫有一些像印象派的畫家；他注意的是世事的表面，他在他最優良的作品中給我們勾　出了一幅英國密特　陶器工業城的詳圖。高爾斯華綏的視界較受限制，他寫的多半是工業革命產物而在世紀末已現衰退的資本家和職業階級的人物。　　一般說來，上面這幾位英國小說家也許可以視作是唯物主義者，但另外有一輩人却打算用不同的方法去探討各色的經驗：如約瑟芬·康拉特（Joseph　Fonral）（波蘭藉出身）對海的羅曼　　深思，再有契斯探登（G.　K.　Che　terton），他的怪異的煽情小說，實是基督敎　的諷喻。此外　　斯脫（E.　M.　Gorster）殆是一個大生的小說家。他五部作品中的第四部『哈華德之末日』（Howard's　End），是與『潘萊先生』同在一九一〇年出版的可是他的精巧的諷刺，幽默，以及對人物關係影形的敏感，　作品是應該與一九二〇年代小說家並列的。　　勞侖斯　　一般來說，對唯物主義人生觀的反對，是由勞侖斯（D.　H.　Lowrence）的新時代開始了的。勞侖斯的第一本重要小說『子與愛』（Sons　and　Lovers），一部份就是自轉式的故事，內容是講一個母親怎樣的愛着她的兒子，她和她兒子愛人間怎樣的起着感情的鬥爭。就作品的佈局與結構言，很有些像『寫實主義』的小說家，可是就其描述感象與情緒的生動而言，則完全是簇新的。勞侖斯所眞正關心的是非智能的生活——即感覺，神經與情緒的生活。他的散文常常充滿了含蓄和過甚的形容，但却很美聯社他對自然界，烏獸花草的描寫，　如對現代的文學投射了一道光芒。　　勞侖斯矚望的新生命就是自然界，尤其是在性的方面，這是他視爲人能恢復其自然自我的首要經驗。他對理性俞覺得不可信賴，他就愈轉向非理性的『血肉之軀』了。他說他的頭腦就像黑森林中的一塊空地，等待着『黑色之　』去佔有他。他對於他所謂垂死的文明厭惡之餘，就打算逃出工業的英國。他最先到義大利，再到澳洲，最後到了墨西哥哥。他於一九三〇年患肺疾而死，他的最後幾件作品中顯示了他疾病的影響，特別是『華朶蘭夫人的愛人』（Lecy　Chatterley's　Louer）一書，將性生活的經驗那塊的暴露無遺，竟至令人不忍卒　。　　勞侖斯與他同時代者間的衝突是很厲害的。許多人罵他，許多人抄襲他，然而眞正瞭解他的人則很少。在他的知己中有一個呌赫胥黎（Al　ous　Hu　ley）的靑年人，頭腦伶敏，但很少勞侖斯的神秘主義成份，可是很能享受生活，例如在「滑稽舞」（Antlc　Hay）中所表現的快樂主義即是。不久一顆濃厚的批評色彩在他的作品中出現了，在他的「勇敢的新世界」（Brane　New　Worid）中，他用嘲笑威可斯式烏托邦的佈局，寫了一首我們時代的最無力的諷刺詩。嗣此以後，他就受了準佛敎的靜寂主義的影響，他後來的許多小說，尤其如「終有結束時」（Gime　Must　Hawa　Stop），就是他的新觀點的表現。一九二〇年另有幾個著名的諷刺家，像劉易士（Wyndham　Lewis）和潘惠士（T.　F.　Powys），他們的諷喻奇特而曖昧，一若哈代小說中所講到的　薩克斯地方的境界，實即是介於瘋人院與地獄之間了。　　喬埃斯（James　Joyce）　　在一九二〇年代中勢力足與勞侖斯相抗衡的另一個小說家，是喬埃斯。喬埃斯是愛爾蘭人，生於都柏林，他像勞侖斯一樣，也是反對唯物主義進步的自由原理的，可是他又與勞侖斯不同，他並不羅曼的克，而是悲觀主義更帶着一些好心腸，這使他變成了一個不可知論的天主敎徒。他的大作就是『優萊栖斯』（Ulysses），內容是講都柏林或名人物的一天故事。他原想把這本書寫我和奧特賽一樣的故事，書中的人與事都具有荷馬的出典。我們祗有用「內心獨語」的方法，始能去跟縱書中人物的複雜，有時且是野陋的思想。而且書中的每一章都是用適於這一章內容的特殊技巧寫成的，全書簡實就是一本技巧實習的敎科書。這似乎是說喬埃斯的主要性格是其愛美性。這一點在某種種程度內雖然是對的，但他也具有豐富的人性，幽默感以及觀察力（不過並不是視覺的觀察力，因在他生命的末期，他殆乎已成瞎眼），他確是本世紀中最有功勞的作者之一。　　在別的許多實驗『內心獨白』的作家中，要孫烏夫太太（Virgina　Woolf　Mrs）是獲得成功了。不過烏夫太太的方法是精選式的，反之喬埃斯則是攏統式的。因此她的小說較欠粗壯，較不普遍，事實上書中人物也確乎是生活在一種精緻的空氣中，個個人物似乎都具有他們的創作者本人所特有的精確和銳利的睿智。像「陶洛　太太」（Mrs.　Dalloway）「到燈塔去」（Go　The　Lighthouse），『波』（The　Waves）等小說，都是高度琢磨過的藝術佳作，就其各自的主題言都是十分精巧的。但將這些和喬埃斯所苦心構思，但有時使人觸耳的樂隊相較之下，那就等於是室內音樂了。　　報吿文學　　在最近的十五年或二十年間尙沒有地位足值稱道的英國新小說家出現。但也有許多有趣味的東西。法朗士·卡夫卡（Franz　Kafka）的影響即出現於雷克斯·瓦納（Rex　Warner）的政治小說與威廉·沙遜（William　Sunson）的短篇故事中。在一九三〇年代出現了一羣專志於『報吿文學』的靑年作家，他們企圖將某種的生活形態——通常是工人階級的生活——加以如實的獨立的報導出來。這一運動的結果雖然產生了若干優秀的短篇故事作者，可是却很少產生小說家，雖說其方法也許影響及亨利·葛萊恩（Henry　Green）的小說，他最近的作品如「美人計」（Canght　and　Loning）即以對白生動著稱。現代英國小說的另一個特點是認眞的作家們都好用煽情式的故事。像加拉罕，葛萊恩（Graham　Greenc）的“Brghton”　（講跑馬黨）及「權力與榮耀」（The　Power　and　the　Glory）（講一個被鬼迷的墨西哥哥牧師）中，都使用煽情的塲面來表現天主敎的生活觀，及其對罪惡的意識等，使人容易想起莫里亞克（Francois　Mauriac）的作品；但另有一個也呌葛萊恩（F.　L.　Green）的，則產生了許多研究犯罪者思想的東西。　　我們得承認一九四〇年代是英國小說的轉移期。靑年的一代現在全神灌注於詩，而老的一代則已終止生產了。未來雖然充滿着希望不過其形式則尙不能預言批評語錄  汪揚　　好的批評家便是一個記述他的心靈在傑作間冒險的人。　—法郎士　　最好的批評是比創作更其創作的。　—王爾德　　偉大的作品是批評家和作家協力完成的。　—盧那卡爾斯基　　批評家應該比思想家聰明而比藝術家有天才。　—託爾斯基　　人們是不能禁止批評的，如人們不能禁止視覺，語言，和批斷的行使一樣。　—巴爾扎克　　批評家的眼睛被淚水所糢糊的時候，他的斷判便沒有很大的價值了。　—海湼　　批評家的第一任務，是將藝術作品的思想從藝術的言語譯成社會學的言語，而從這裏發現出文學現象的社會學等值。　—蒲列汗諾夫白描仕女  溥心畬最近的世界文壇  趙景深　　英國文學在蘇聯　　據「三十年來的蘇聯」中「三十年來的蘇聯書籍」，「外國文學最好的代表者的作品，在蘇聯人民中非常地流行。蘇維埃政權存在的二十九年中間，共印了拜倫的作品四十九萬九千冊，狄更司的作品二百二十八萬七千冊，莎士比亞的作品一百六十一萬一千冊。我們可以說，這些作品在這同時期之內，就是它們的本國也沒有印過這麼多的冊數。對於世界各國人民建立的一切最好而最進步的東西，蘇聯的人民從來也不曾敵視過。」這些話都是確實的，我們可以再舉幾件事來作爲證明：　　一　喬叟的新譯本　　喬叟（Geoffrey　Chaucer）的「剛脫保萊故事」（The　C	anterbury　Tales）出版，無疑地是蘇聯文藝界的一件大事。　　俄國讀者以前對於喬叟的知識，限於前世紀末所譯的故事的斷片，無論從　理或詩趣看，都不是合適的。　　最近的譯本是卡西金（Lvan　Kashkin）和路馬（Osip　Rumer）譯的，特點是完全譯出和忠實於著。計者竭力保持原文的特點，讀來極爲流暢。注釋極多，有歷史的，文化的和文學的注脚。並附錄論喬叟的語言一篇。序言是卡西金寫的，講的是喬叟的時代，詩人的性格和他在英國文學史上的地位。喬叟的民土精神直到現在都還是新鮮溫暖的。　　卡西金說，喬叟在「剛脫保萊故事」裏歌唱，向封建制度的英國吿別，他帶着不可隱瞞的感傷，哀悼過去尊貴的精神。他是第一個向新時代的人民說話的，但他也曾毫不遲疑地指摘他們的弱點和罪行。　　二　史維夫特二百年死祭　　英國史維夫特（Jonathan　Swift,　1667-1745）在我國不是一個陌生的人物。他的「格列佛遊記」（Gulliver's　Travels）我國先有林紓的文言譯本，題作「海外軒渠錄」，後來又有未名社的話譯本。似乎只譯了小人國和大人國的部分，第三次所遊歷的飛人島都不曾譯出。前年正是他的二百年死祭，在十月廿五日那天，蘇聯對外文化協會開了一個紀念會，紀念這位英國的大諷刺文學家。　　克曼諾夫（Vlaoimir　S.　Kemenov）首先致詞云：『史維夫特是被善良的人們所深切理解的。但對於僞善者，滑頭，蠢人和陰謀者却是太危險了，他發出勇敢的聲音來反對他們，他們爲報復起見，就揑造了史維夫特厭世的傳說。』　　『滋育史維夫特的天才的不是對於人類的憎恨，而是對於人類的摯愛。』　　『史維夫特是蘇聯所喜愛的一個作家，從一九一七年到一九四五年，他的作品印過九十八種不同的本子，譯成三十八種蘇聯的語言。總印數達一百七十萬零九千五百本。』　　後來傑夫里戈夫（A.　K.　Jivelegov）敎授報吿史維夫特的生平和作品。　　查斯來夫斯基（D.　Zaslavsky）說起史維夫特對於俄國大諷刺家的影響，特別是莎爾條加夫（Saltykov）筆名謝特林（Schecrin）品。他强調大部分的諷刺可適用於現在。　　摩羅佐夫（Morozov）談到史維特文藝作品的特殊作風。詩人馬夏克（Samuel　Marshak）朗誦史維夫特給批評家的一封信，得到溫暖的讚美。英國公使的全權代表羅伯慈（Roberts）演說，談到蘇聯人民對於英國文學有這樣豐富的知識，他非常高興。又說起英蘇文化應該相互交流。　　這集會的參加者，除上述六位外，還有英國的白萊士（Philip　Price）對外文化協會文學部分的會員，作家，演員，學者以及蘇聯外國印刷局的代表。蘇州小記  林咏泉　　記得十幾年前曾到過蘇州，不，那只是能說是經過蘇州吧，一些糢糊的影子，現在都忘記了，都隨着戰爭的砲火，一同消逝了，因此我依然如一個陌生人來到這兒，來到這從多少年以來被稱爲地上的天堂。　　但情景顯然不同了，當我　離開車站時，迎接着的首先便是碎石舖成的鄉村路，路側有些小草棚，城牆邊躺着一條不算窄的河，幾隻無聲的木船，在平靜的水流中划行着。城牆的側面畫着標語與廣吿，古舊的磚石的顏色和那些耀眼的采澤配起來，總覺得不合適。雖然時常有列車到臨的煩　聲，也不能打破這一片荒涼，這許多彷彿走入古代圖畫中的蕭疎與寂靜，想起「姑蘇城外寒山寺，夜半鍾聲到客船」之句。却正是對此景之寫照了。　　城內的路和城外是一樣的—石子路，不管那一條都是一樣的，想起那些打石的人，不過爲了生活，胡亂地把牠打碎裂再由築路的人，胡亂地舖在地上罷了，所好，那兩旁的房屋，兩旁的住宅與商店，都落在時代的後面太遠了，和這些路配合起來，總還相稱。　　也正由於這觸目皆是的石子路，和這陳舊的中國形式的城市，便令人不知不覺的忘記「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」那句使人艷美的話了，而且逐漸的因爲不能和那句話符合，使一些人把從前的驕傲也消逝了，實在，這不過是一座城，一座普通的漸漸使人忘記牠的令譽的古城罷了。　　在蘇州，處處不要忘記一個「小」字，到處是小巷，到處是小橋，一向爲人讚頌的獅子林，滄浪亭與拙政園，也都是彎彎曲曲的小欄杆，一座一座的小假山，一處一處的小小亭閣與台榭，一小灣一小灣的池塘，與一條一條的小徑……這正是描寫着小說中後花園才子仕人相會的故事，寫着红楼夢中聯詩對句的塲所，如果能够耐心忍性用一種隱士的心情去欣賞，稱牠爲「巧小玲瓏」却是最恰當的了。　　我最怕蘇州的小巷，長長的小巷又接着陡窄的小橋，我想到那些列戶相對的人家，眞該都是些溫文儒雅的人，因爲那是不能奔跑，不許可跳躍啊，因此那些白面書生，大概也都因爲門遮戶掩沒有寬敞的庭院，使陽光無法照臨，使粗手粗脚的風無從吹到所致，還有這一種細聲細氣的「蘇州話」，怕也因爲相鄰的人太近了，相對的人太近了，聲音不能大，大則震動四鄰，波及全街。　　長巷是悠閑嗎？像那些古舊的門壁與圍牆，有時誠然會予人以不少沉默安靜，但總嫌侷促啊，時代的風浪太大了，多少舊的形式都要重新改過，重新翻倒，重新樹立，……　　如果你要到蘇州，爲了牠的令譽來看看，請先在那靠北門外的橋上站一站，尤其在這個秋天，寬廣的石橋，連結着古城牆與平原，跨越着清澈的河水，傱然不會使你生出多少美妙的想像，但這種靜默蕭疎的景象，確會使人生着懷古之情。然後你乘着一輛蒙上雨天的簾子的人力車，一直拖到天賜莊，去看看那紅樓與綠樹，看看那空闊的草坪，那可使你任意於奔跑與跳躍，狂嘯與高歌，更因爲時常嗚奏　鍾聲與琴聲以及鳥雀的歌聲，會把你底靈魂引向遠處，引向葱　與活躍，引向壯　與前進，引向一所莊嚴肅穆的人生領域裏去。</p>

<h3>The Land Tax Revenue is Fully Allocated to Local Authorities; Supplementary Implementation Rules for Curbing the Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities Will Be Formulated Separately: Two Important Cases Resolved at Yesterday's Political Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The method of dividing central and local finances for the first half of the 37th year was passed at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 6th, and it can be implemented after it is passed at the State Council meeting. It is learned that in order to enrich local finances, the central government has decided to increase local tax revenues. In the 36th year, all business tax revenue was allocated to local authorities, and now it has been decided that all land tax revenue will also be allocated to local authorities.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] After the government adopted comprehensive control over current finances and finance, the implementation of financial management was carried out first, followed by the control of cotton yarn and cloth. Now, it is further expanding to the control of daily necessities for people's livelihood, so that prices can be suppressed and currency values ​​stabilized. It is learned that this method was formulated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, entitled "Measures for Curbing the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Essential Goods for People's Livelihood." After discussion at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 6th, the political committee members all agreed that the "Measures for Curbing the Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times," promulgated in February of the 30th year of the Republic of China, already had complete regulations and that there was no need to formulate new laws separately and could save the legislative procedure and formalities. Subsequently, it was resolved that the currently drafted proposal would be cancelled, and the method of the extraordinary period in Sichuan (full text published on page 2) would still be used to formulate implementation rules, which would then be sent to the Executive Yuan for review.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Postal and Telecommunications Price Increase Case, the Executive Yuan Reports the Resolutions of the State Council</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Regarding the postal and telecommunications price increase, after it was previously passed by the State Council, the Legislative Yuan suggested to the State Council that the Executive Yuan be instructed to promptly submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan for review. The National Government then handed it over to the Legal System Review Committee for review. According to the report: "The State Council is the highest state organ of the National Government according to law and has the power to formulate legislative principles. According to past precedents, the State Council has amended legal provisions by resolution and executed them first. The commission believes that the government committee, in accordance with Article 16 of the National Government Organization Law, is currently the highest state organ of the National Government, and the precedents are as mentioned above. Therefore, the State Council should be considered to have the power to make expedient decisions, and the resolution of its 16th meeting regarding the postal and telecommunications price increase case should be considered legal and effective." This was submitted to the 18th State Council meeting for a resolution, "Passed according to the review opinions, and instructed the Executive Yuan to submit the postal and telecommunications price increase case to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures." Orders were issued to the executive and legislative branches. The Executive Yuan submitted a report at its 37th meeting on the 6th and sent it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures.</p>
<h3>Constructing Postal Routes in the Northwest and Urgent Repairs of Provincial Highways: The Political Affairs Meeting Approves the Allocation of Huge Sums of Money</h3>
<p>[Correspondent Report from Nanjing, 6th] The plan to construct postal routes in the Northwest was approved at the Political Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 6th, and it was decided to allocate 18.47 billion yuan as the initial funds to build the Lanzhou-Dihua Line, the Lanzhou-Ningxia Line, and the Guanzhong-Xi'an Line. According to the Ministry of Transportation's plan for the construction of postal routes in the Northwest, which was formulated in accordance with the outline of the first phase of construction plan in the Northwest region, the Northwest postal automobile route construction plan is divided into four lines: (A) Lanzhou to Dihua Line, (B) Lanzhou to Ningxia Line, (C) Ningxia to Baotou Line, (D) Lanzhou to Xining Line, with a total length of 3.406 kilometers. The Lanzhou-Dihua Line is the main artery of postal transportation in the Northwest, and it has been gradually and strenuously promoted and completed. The Ningxia Provincial Government has repeatedly requested the opening of automobile services on the Lanzhou-Ningxia Line. Secondly, the Ningxia-Baotou and Ningxia-Xining Lines, one is to connect North China and the Northwest, and the other is to connect the provincial capitals of the two provinces. However, they have no economic value to the postal service, but in order to develop the frontier postal routes, they are still being strenuously repaired. The estimated budget is 13.97 billion yuan for the Lanzhou-Dihua Line, 3.7 billion yuan for the Lanzhou-Ningxia Line, 4.53 billion yuan for the Ningxia-Baotou Line, and 800 million yuan for the Lanzhou-Xining Line, totaling 23 billion yuan. It has now been decided to postpone the Ningxia-Baotou Line, so the allocation of funds has been reduced to 18.47 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] In order to meet the needs of suppressing bandits and striving for military victory, the Shanxi authorities plan to urgently repair the Taiyuan-Fenlin, Taiyuan-Ningxia, and Taiyuan-Lanzhou three highways, and submitted the engineering plan and budget to the Executive Yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Food Prices Soar: The Economic Council Discusses Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] In view of the recent successive surges in cotton yarn and food prices, which are leading the price increases, the All-China Economic Council (全經會) Secretariat has studied the underlying causes. After layer-by-layer analysis, the impact of production, processing, transportation, and sales on commodity prices has been assessed. The results have largely determined that excessive profits at the point of sale in the market account for a percentage of the commodity price that clearly exceeds the scope of legitimate profit due to unreasonable manipulation. The secretariat of the council is continuing to study the actual details and effective countermeasures for this issue.</p>
<h3>The Guidance Committee for Trade with Japan Decides on Visa and Accounting Procedures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The Guidance Committee for Trade with Japan held its ninth meeting at noon on the 6th, presided over by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Tong Jiling. The meeting discussed the visa and accounting procedures, and it was decided that after the Chinese commercial commissioner stationed in Japan issues a certificate, the Central Trust Bureau will record the transaction based on this certificate, and then the Import and Export Trade Committee will issue the import and export permits accordingly. The committee is scheduled to hold another meeting on the 7th to discuss the types of trade goods and the quantity limits in various trade plans.</p>
<h3>Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Yuan, Returns to Beijing: Speaks Freely About the General Situation in the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Zhang Yuan, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at about 1:00 PM on the 6th. Mrs. Zhang and Wang Defang, Wei Xuezhi, and Zhou Shukai, secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all went to the station to greet him. After Zhang met with Foreign Minister Wang at the ministry, he returned to his residence to rest. His health has greatly improved, and he will start working again in the next few days. According to what he told our reporter, when he left the United States to return to China, the concern of the American government and public about the overall situation was becoming increasingly tense. At this time, Congress has resumed its sessions, and the situation is thought to be even more heated. Many discussions are expected on international and domestic issues. Although commodity prices in the United States are said to be higher than before, the average income of the people can still meet their needs for food and clothing, and the standard of living has not declined. It can be said that they have enough resources, and the problem of commodity prices is not enough to affect the decision-making of major issues. Regarding the attitude of the United States toward China, in general, they are very friendly. The amount of aid to China announced by Marshall and the plans that have been drafted were all actively proposed by the US government and supported by influential members of both houses of Congress. If there is more understanding of the current situation in our country, the result that all parties unanimously hope for will not be difficult to obtain. Zhang praised the achievements of overseas Chinese in the United States, Hawaii, and the Philippines. The performance of their business talents has been praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. It is reported that Zhang accompanied Foreign Minister Wang to the United States to attend the UN General Assembly, and then stayed in the United States for medical treatment due to a tooth ailment. He recently returned to China on the "Meiqi" ship.</p>
<h3>Surveying of the Yunnan-Burma Border Begins</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 6th] A group from the Boundary Survey Team of the Ministry of Interior, led by Director Chuan Si of the Topography Department, is heading to the Yunnan-Burma border to conduct on-site surveying. After several days of preparation, everything is ready. At 8:00 AM this morning, they set off in two teams, one heading south and the other heading north, to work in nine counties: Longling, Gengma, Zhenkang, Luxi, Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianshan, and Tengchong, and will also go to areas such as Gaoliangpo and Songnanshan. Director Chuan Si originally planned to lead the team in person, but due to important official duties in the capital, he is currently staying in Kunming to wait for a flight back to Beijing.</p>
<h3>There is No Secret Agreement Among the Three Powers on Handling the Japanese Reparations Issue, Says US State Department Spokesperson</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] At a press briefing today, a State Department spokesperson was asked about a letter from Republican Senator Knowland to Under Secretary of State Lovett yesterday, requesting clarification on whether there was a secret agreement among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union allowing the Soviet Union to obtain a large amount of Japanese factory equipment. What is the government's opinion? The spokesperson replied, "Absolutely not," and said that the Soviet Union has no share in the 30% of Japanese machinery designated as initial reparations. Regarding the issue of distributing Japanese reparations, the United States has proposed several plans in the Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission, but no resolution has been reached. Every time the United States proposes a plan, it is opposed by the Soviet representative. The United States maintains that the distribution of Japanese reparations should be based on the extent of contribution and the magnitude of losses in defeating Japan. To date, the US policy on this issue can be found in the instructions issued to MacArthur.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Japanese Reparation Machinery, More Than 6,000 Units, is About to be Shipped</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The initial total number of machines to be received by our country as Japanese reparation goods was 9,447 units. Due to the need to balance the value and grade of the machines received by the various Allied countries, it has been repeatedly adjusted, and finally revised to 9,398 units. The first batch of 6,544 units will be received first, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the "Hai Kang" and "Hai Zhe" ships to sail to Japan to load them. When experts from the驻日赔偿及归还物资接收委员会 (Commission for Receiving Reparations and Returned Materials Stationed in Japan) inspected these machines, the Tokyo area was found to be the worst, while the Nagoya and Nagasaki areas were found to be the best in average quality. Therefore, the machines to be received first this time are mainly from the Nagoya Army Arsenal and the Chigusa Manufacturing Plant, followed by the Nagasaki, Kawatana Naval Factory, and the 21st Naval Air Factory.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Correspondent, 6th] The "Hai Zhe" ship is scheduled to leave Keelung on the 8th and sail to Shanghai to transfer to Japan to transport reparation goods.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Residents of Kowloon Walled City Being Forced to Move, Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Protest, Demanding that the Hong Kong Government Stop Coercive Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Shi Zhaoying, Acting Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on the evening of the 6th: Regarding the residents of Kowloon Walled City being forced to demolish their houses and move, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the British Embassy in China on the 6th and requested the British Ambassador to immediately cable the Hong Kong government to stop all coercive measures.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Lapochel, a counselor at the British Embassy, said, "The Kowloon incident is only a local administrative issue for the Hong Kong government." The relocation of residents is nothing more than for public health and fire prevention. According to unconfirmed reports, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a new representative to Hong Kong, as the representatives previously sent have been rejected by the Hong Kong authorities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 6th] The Hong Kong government completed the work of demolishing thatched and wooden houses in the old urban area of Kowloon on Saturday morning. No more accidents occurred. Two Chinese who were arrested yesterday when the demolition began have been charged in the Kowloon Court with inciting the public and disobeying police orders. Both defendants have been remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Participating in Discussions on Aid to China Plans: Bei Zuyi Flies to the United States Tomorrow, Yu Dawei Postpones His Trip Due to His Mother's Illness</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Yu Dawei and Bei Zuyi, the two technical advisors from our country invited to the United States, are still collecting materials from various relevant parties in Beijing in preparation for their trip to the United States. According to sources close to Bei, because this mission is extremely important and the trip is suddenly approaching, they have to carefully obtain sufficient information from the relevant parties, especially contact with the financial community. He almost spent the whole day meeting with Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank. According to authoritative sources, the plans for the use of US loans submitted by our country will still be based on the principles of stabilizing finances and suppressing prices. Bei has now decided to take the China National Aviation Corporation's Sino-US flight from Shanghai on the 8th to the United States. Bei is only taking one attendant, Chen Changtong, the current manager of the International Department of the Bank of China. Chen is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the morning of the 7th to assist Bei in preparing materials and will rush back to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 7th. Yu Dawei paid another visit to President Chiang at 8:30 AM on the 6th to ask for instructions. He was originally scheduled to travel with Bei, but because his mother is ill in the Central Hospital in Beijing, Yu is visiting and caring for her at any time, so his trip has been postponed.</p>
<h3>The Total Amount of Aid to China Funds May be 500 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Well-informed sources say: The total amount of the planned long-term US aid to China plan will reach 700 million US dollars, but several independent items in this figure will undoubtedly be greatly reduced. They indicated that the State Department may finally propose a figure of 500 million US dollars.</p>
<p>On the 6th, there were signs indicating that the drafting of the aid to China plan will officially begin in mid-January. US officials who have returned to the Far East, such as former Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, have received instructions from Marshall to go to Washington for consultation and should arrive before January 10. Currently, several departments are drafting the details of the aid to China. The general outlook in Washington is that the details will be merged and proposed at various meetings to be held on January 12 and then revised.</p>
<h3>The Use of 18 Million US Dollars in Loans is Being Discussed in Detail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th, United Press] It is reported that State Department experts and Chinese officials will formulate detailed rules for the use of the US$18 million in emergency aid to China during this congressional session. The outcome of the consultations is expected to make concrete decisions on the types of supplies to be provided under this line of credit and will determine the accurate comparison of various supplies. Only two items have been determined under the emergency plan so far: food and fertilizer. If China cannot obtain sufficient food from the United States within the three-month period of the above-mentioned plan, the shortage is expected to include oil and cotton. China has obtained a rice allocation of 58,000 tons in the first six months of this year, so it is expected that part of the emergency aid funds will be used to pay for half of the above-mentioned rice. According to well-informed sources, State Department officials are also preparing detailed measures for a 15-month long-term aid plan, which is said to require more than 300 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Cracks Down on Illegal Underground Banks; Illegal Underground Banks in Hankou are Still Trying to Struggle</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 6th] In order to strictly control the market, the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau has decided to crack down on underground banks that have not been legally registered in the near future and has ordered all banks and financial institutions in the city to submit daily statements on a daily basis starting from the 5th for verification. Also, the financial market in Guangzhou has been relatively stable recently. The Hong Kong dollar has been hovering around 27,000, and gold has been around 8.4 million.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Correspondent, 6th] Regarding the crackdown on illegal underground banks in Hankou, after the Financial Management Bureau resolutely implemented it, the authorities severely stopped the coercive actions taken by the industry. Starting this morning, 59 illegal underground banks sent representatives to the Municipal Assembly to petition, intending to find another way to struggle. Also, the Financial Management Bureau's measures were thorough this time. The market's finances were not adversely affected, and prices have also fallen. It is generally considered a major achievement in governance.</p>
<h3>Ice and Snow Melt in Dihua; The New Year Turns Warm, Unseen for Many Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 6th] Since the New Year, the temperature in Dihua has risen, and the ice and snow have melted in the past few days, and the streets are muddy, which already has a hint of the vernal equinox. Today it is one degree below zero, which has not been seen for many years. With the warming of the season, people here hope that the Shanghai-Dihua route of the China National Aviation Corporation, which was suspended due to the severe cold, can resume operations.</p>
<h3>An Officer, Liu Leshan, who Embezzled Military Pay was Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of National Defense executed an officer, Liu Leshan, by firing squad today for embezzling military pay. Liu was from Yishui County, Shandong Province, and was 28 years old. He was a captain in the Ministry of National Defense. In March of last year, he privately sold more than 200 catties of staple food rice received by his group for February, along with more than 30 catties of five bags of flour received in March, and falsely reported and embezzled hundreds of thousands of yuan in salaries and allowances for all levels of personnel in the group.</p>
<h3>Barbershops in the Capital Closed; The Issue of Requesting a Price Increase Has Not Yet Been Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] Millions of citizens in the capital had no haircuts on the 6th because barbers went on strike to demand a price increase. All barbershops were closed. Those who did not close were blamed by their peers and were even vandalized. Barbershop owners and barbers demanded a 150% increase in haircut prices. They went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition on the morning of the 5th without success. They went on strike on the same day. Starting on the morning of the 6th, all barbershops in the city were closed. Only a few barbershops in extremely remote areas were still open. More than 200 barbershop owners and barbers went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition again. The bureau planned to submit the matter to the deliberation meeting to be held on the 8th for discussion. The petitioners insisted that the price increase must be made on the 6th. The commotion did not end until the afternoon. It is not yet determined whether they will resume business on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Talks About the Xinjiang Issue; The Government Decides to Invite Ahmatjan to Beijing or, If Not, Negotiate Nearby in Dihua</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 6th] The government has decided to invite Ahmatjan to Beijing to discuss the solution to the Xinjiang issue, or, if he does not come to Beijing, negotiate nearby in Dihua. This is what General Zhang Zhizhong said when he met with our reporter on the 6th. Zhang said: The date of his return to Xinjiang has not yet been determined. He is currently waiting for a letter from Yining to find out if Ahmatjan has accepted the government's invitation to come to Beijing for talks. Zhang believes that the Xinjiang issue is not serious, and the election of a provincial governor is not a problem in principle, but the election procedures and methods are still to be formulated and announced by the central government before they can be followed. Zhang said: The county magistrates and commissioners of Xinjiang Province have already been elected by the people, so the election of the governor should not be difficult. As for the time of its realization, it is still difficult to determine. It is speculated that it will be after March. The reporter asked again whether it was true that Burhan Shahidi, a member of the government committee, might return to Xinjiang to run for governor. Zhang smiled and said: This matter will depend on the voters of Xinjiang Province. Also, Zhang had an audience with President Chiang a few days ago. The reporter specifically asked whether the president had recently given any instructions on the Xinjiang issue. He replied, no.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's Proposal for a Peace Conference Has Not Yet Been Responded to by the United States; The British Government Maintains its Original Stance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The US State Department today received a copy of the Soviet Union's reply to China. The Soviet Union's reply suggests that countries participating in the Far Eastern Commission should attend the proposed preparatory peace conference with Japan in a limited manner. The preparatory peace conference should also be held in China this month. The State Department is still studying the Soviet Union's note and will not express its attitude on the issue recently. The British government's opinion has been clearly stated in the notes sent to the Chinese and Soviet governments on December 12 of last year.</p>
<h3>On the Coasts of Tianjin, Yantai, Dalian and Other Small Ports, Ghost Ship Fleets are Busy Sailing at Night; The Goods They Carry Cannot Yet Be Known</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] A Chinese authority said on the 5th: Between the ports controlled by the Soviet Union in the Northeast and the small ports on the coasts of Yantai, Tianjin, and North China, ghost ship fleets travel every night, carrying goods. It cannot be proven whether these ships are controlled by the Soviet Union, and the government cannot know what they are carrying. The ships are all locally made, most of them are huge, and some can carry 10,000 tons of cargo. They are fully loaded when traveling back and forth. Because of the many islands along the way, they can travel back and forth secretly at night. "They always sail at night, and we don't know what they are carrying, but we know for sure that they often dock at various points on the coast of North China, and we also know that there is no space in the cabins on the return trip." It is believed that this fleet is transporting soybeans, cotton, coal, and tungsten filaments left behind by the Japanese from North China. As for what is being transported from Dalian and Lushun, the Chinese government admits that it is unclear. "We have no way of knowing or proving whether the Soviet Union is supplying the Chinese Communists, but we know for sure that the traffic between the coast of North China and Dalian is very busy." Once, a huge ship in the fleet was painted with the UN symbol, but Chinese intelligence believed that it was completely fake. It is believed that the authority does not believe reports that the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union held a meeting in northern Northeast China to discuss the Soviet Union supplying the Chinese Communists with weapons. The government believes that the Soviet Union would not publicly violate the 1945 Moscow Agreement, but secretly assisting the Chinese Communists is another matter. As long as the Soviet Union does not publicly take any action, the Chinese government feels helpless to deal with it, unless there is solid evidence. Even if the United Nations is asked to investigate, it would be a waste of effort. If the Chinese Navy or coastal artillery units take direct action, the Soviet Union's reaction would be very strong. The Chinese government is trying its best to avoid accidents and avoid causing another world war. China remembers the lesson of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident.</p>
<h3>Factories in Dalian and Lushun Manufacture Military Equipment; The Soviet Union Trains Communist Troops in Northeast China</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] It is reported that four senior Chinese government officials went to Dalian and Lushun last year to inspect the area. After they returned, they reported that the ordnance factories in the area were manufacturing Japanese-style weapons and ammunition. The Ministry of National Defense has not yet revealed a word of the report, but authoritative sources said that the government investigation team was led by General Yan Ping and was under strict Soviet surveillance in Dalian and Lushun and was not allowed to enter the factories. However, because the investigation team was on the scene, it obtained confirmation that the factories were in operation at the time. The Japanese used the above-mentioned factories during the war to supply their Kwantung Army. The investigation team also said that it had obtained sufficient evidence that the Chinese Communists were being trained by the Soviet Union in the area. Chinese intelligence said that the factories are still in operation. The main points of the report of the Chinese investigation team are as follows: "All the factories previously known to be ammunition factories and the centers for training the Chinese Communist troops are prohibited from inspection by the Soviet authorities. All the Communist troops in the area have newly made Japanese-style military equipment, and their training is purely Soviet-style. From the outside, if there are no uniforms, it is almost impossible to distinguish between the Chinese Communist puppet army and the Mongolian army."</p>
<h3>Soviet Radio Denies Military Assistance to the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, Broadcasting on the 6th: Moscow Radio broadcast that Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of the Northern China Headquarters of the Kuomintang, recently said that the Soviet Union had supplied the Chinese Communists in the Northeast with weapons, ammunition, and military advisors. TASS has now been authorized to deny this.</p>
<h3>Hubei Troops Recapture Hao Xue, Bandits Invading Shayang Also Repelled by National Army</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The bandit Liu's Jianghan Independent Brigade, led by Luo Houfu, invaded Hao Xue. On the 5th, they were crushed by our local troops, and Hao Xue has been recovered. More than a thousand bandits invading Shayang were also crushed by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Military News: The main force of the bandit Zhang Jian's troops in central Hubei has moved west from Honghu, attempting to invade Jianli. The National Army had made early arrangements and will definitely not let them succeed. Separately, a band of scattered bandits occupying Zhoujiaji Chang fled southeast towards Shayang in disarray on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 6th] Executive Headquarters News: Mianyang, which was once recovered, has recently been invaded again by bandit troops.</p>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 5th] The Da Shi Qiao station south of Xuchang on the Pinghan Railway was invaded by Chen Yi's bandit troops on the 4th. The National Army stationed in Xuchang went south to attack and is currently surrounding them. The engineering train for the Pinghan Railway repair project returned to Zhengzhou. [Another Dispatch, 6th] The situation in Xuchang was unclear on the 6th. A small number of remnant bandits were discovered in Xuchang and Xinzheng. [Our Dispatch, 6th] The remnant troops of Chen Yi in the Hao County area between Anhui and Henan are being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, their territory is shrinking and they are in dire straits. Chen Yi recently convened a cadre meeting and decided to plow up the wheat seedlings in the fields to cut off the livelihood of the farmers.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Opening of the 80th United States Congress—The American Government and People Will Assume an Honorable Responsibility to the World</h3>
<p>The Eightieth Congress of the United States opens today. President Truman will send a message to Congress outlining a systematic plan regarding several serious problems currently facing Britain, such as preventing inflation, providing long-term aid for European economic recovery, and assisting China in its recovery and national reconstruction. It is expected that the U.S. Congress will engage in heated debates on these issues.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 1948, we believe it will be a year of major decisions, both for American domestic affairs and for the overall world situation, and the direction of these decisions can largely be seen from the Eighth Congress which opens today. Regarding American domestic affairs, the presidential election will be held within this year, and the rivalry between the Democratic and Republican parties is gradually intensifying. Although both parties have a consensus on foreign policy, they still differ on the urgency and importance of various issues. In particular, there are major differences in opinion between the two parties on how to prevent inflation and avoid domestic economic panic, which have almost become the main themes of the two parties' election campaigns. The outcome of the upcoming election will have a significant impact on the future direction of American domestic and foreign policy. Regarding the overall world situation, since the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference ended unhappily last year, the prospects for world peace seem to have become increasingly bleak. And at the opening of the Small Assembly the day before yesterday, representatives of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries unanimously refused to attend. Although the American representative Austin still called for Soviet cooperation and guaranteed that the Small Assembly would not weaken the authority of the Security Council, whether the United Nations can be an effective organization for maintaining world peace is indeed a major question. How the United States will deal with the current world problems is not only being considered by the American government and people but is also of the utmost concern to people all over the world. This time, the U.S. Congress will discuss these pressing issues and will also make all necessary decisions on behalf of 140 million people, which naturally deserves our close attention.</p>
<p>The United States is a capitalist country, but it is also a country that practices democratic politics. On the one hand, the United States is blessed by nature, allowing its capitalist production to develop to a peak, but it is still seeking further progress. On the other hand, the United States represents the most prevalent democratic ideals of liberalism and fears that the world after World War II will still be dominated by other totalitarian forces, so it is constantly seeking to provide a strong guarantee for world peace. Because the foundation of American development is based on world peace and economic prosperity, it is impossible for the United States to enjoy peace alone in a world of turmoil, and it is impossible for the United States to be prosperous while the world is poor. Historical facts can prove this, and future developments also have signs that can be known. Today, there is no foothold for isolationists in the United States; what their government and people seek day and night is not the self-interest of the United States, nor the exclusive enjoyment of peace and wealth by the United States, but world peace and prosperity. Similarly, what the American government and people worry about day and night is not so much the expansion of Soviet influence or the leaking of atomic secrets, but rather the economic panic that may occur in the United States. The foreign policy of the United States after the war is based on world peace and international cooperation. To put it nicely, it is not without compassion and concern for humanity; to put it bluntly, half of it really contains motives for self-preservation and self-salvation. America's anxiety lies in America's inherent worries. Even President Truman himself said that if American inflation cannot be stopped in time, an economic panic is bound to occur within this year. Therefore, the American government, whether in domestic or foreign affairs, will adhere to this as a criterion in the future. In domestic affairs, President Truman advocates controlling wages and prices and restoring the wartime rationing system; in foreign affairs, he plans to implement a comprehensive foreign aid plan. The so-called foreign aid in his mind, in a positive aspect, is to assist European and Asian countries in their recovery and reconstruction, and in a negative aspect, to ensure that European and Asian countries do not experience economic panic to avoid affecting the American economy. To put it more clearly, if the United States wants to maintain its wartime saturated production boom after the war, it must find ways to ensure that the poor countries in Europe and Asia are free from hunger and have surplus capacity to purchase American exports. Otherwise, if all countries lack "dollars," how can American industry continue to prosper?</p>
<p>In the year 1947, we have indeed seen the American government take big strides towards this goal of foreign aid. The Truman Doctrine of assisting Greece and Turkey and the Marshall Plan for emergency aid to Europe have been implemented one after another, which can be said to be an enlightened plan for America to save others and save itself. However, these plans were still in the initial stages last year and were limited to one corner of Europe, neglecting Asia, which is sufficient to constitute a source of world turmoil. Not only has the aid plan to China been delayed, but also the Truman Doctrine, which takes anti-communism as its backbone, has not been extended to Asia, causing the 450 million people standing on the front line of opposing communist totalitarian politics to deeply feel doubts about the unity of American policy. At this time when Congress is about to open and discuss the issue of aid to China, according to reports from Reuters and the Associated Press, President Truman's message will propose a three-billion-dollar aid plan to China. What the content will be is still unknown as of this writing, but according to the preparations of our government, it has dispatched Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and former Governor of the Central Bank Bei Zuyi to Washington to provide the U.S. Congress with information on the general situation of our country's finance, economy, transportation, and military, and to be available for consultation by U.S. congressmen at any time. It can be seen that the focus of U.S. aid to China will be to assist us in improving the economy and domestic transportation construction.</p>
<p>The general American public has always had a considerable understanding of the importance of China's position in the Far East after the war, especially President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall, who know that to maintain peace in the Far East, there must be a strong, unified, peaceful, and democratic China. However, there are also a few people who do not clearly understand the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, ignore the importance of China's position in the Far East, and occasionally make unrealistic remarks, hindering the implementation of the American aid plan to China. Because the United States is a very democratic country, the American Communist Party can easily speak for the "Chinese Communist Party" to confuse the views of the general American public. Therefore, as the U.S. Congress is about to open and discuss the issue of aid to China, we sincerely ask the members of the U.S. Congress and the national government and people to calmly think about what the world has become after the war and what the situation in the Far East is today.</p>
<p>The World War has been over for more than two years, but the peace treaty with the main enemy countries has not yet been signed, or even drafted. What a strange phenomenon this is! Lake Success is the auspicious place for the founding of the United Nations, but the United Nations conference seems to be getting farther and farther away from the road to "success." What a strange phenomenon this is! Although the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed in Moscow more than two years ago, the National Government still cannot peacefully and smoothly take over the entire Northeast because the communist bandits have the backing of external forces. In the flames of war in the Northeast, there are Japanese, Koreans, Mongolians... and others helping the communist bandits. What a strange phenomenon this is! The United States was the arsenal of the world's democratic countries during the Anti-Japanese War, and now, in this time of peace, it should be the great protector of the world's democratic countries. In short, in this struggle between two forces, democracy and totalitarianism, construction and destruction, humanity and anti-humanity, no matter in any region of the world—in Europe or in China—the United States today has an honorable responsibility to step forward and not shirk its duty. We believe that the current session of the U.S. Congress discussing aid plans to Europe and China is the best opportunity for the American government and people to show that they are shouldering their honorable responsibility.</p>

<h3>UN Small General Assembly Resolves; to Establish a Special Committee; to Draft Rules of Procedure and Regulations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Success Lake 5th dispatch] The United Nations Small General Assembly convened its first meeting today, with the Soviet Union and six Yugoslav countries refusing to attend. The committee was first opened by UN Secretary-General Lai Yi, followed by a speech by US Representative Austin, expressing the hope that the absent countries could quickly participate in cooperation. Subsequently, various matters related to the organization of the committee were approved, and Mexico's Nair Fu was elected as chairman, Belgium's Langen Zhai Fu as vice-chairman, and Iran's Antessa as secretary. The meeting resolved to establish a special committee composed of China, France, Denmark, India, Lebanon, Liberia, Britain, and the United States to draft its procedural charter and report on the 9th. The committee postponed action on the US's proposed work plan pending instructions from the governments of the member states. The US plan suggested that member states submit recommendations on the veto issue so that they could be circulated to member states for later debate on March 15. The US plan also suggested to the Small General Assembly to discuss the general principles of international political history. Although some representatives advocated immediately debating the veto issue, the committee, in view of the fact that most of the representatives in the meeting were "extremely confused and unwilling to speak," voted to postpone the debate until the 9th.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Wins Congressional Confidence; Tax Collection and New Economic Plan Finally Passed; All Amendments Unanimously Rejected</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris 5th dispatch] The Schumann cabinet, which has been in power for six weeks, has already defeated the Communist Party and extreme right-wing members of Congress.

<h3>Japanese Political Situation is Turbulent; Katayama's Delayed Fate Will Depend on the Socialist Party Congress; The Pan-Agricultural Faction's Party Formation Movement Encounters Resistance for the First Time</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency Tokyo 6th dispatch] The Japanese political situation is currently centered on the compilation of the annual budget, the issue of the reorganization of former Agriculture Minister Hirano, and the Socialist Party Congress to be held on the 16th, and is becoming more proactive. After the closing of the first Congress last year, the Katayama cabinet, on the one hand, established the Coal National Management Bill centered on the Democratic Party case through personal negotiations between Nishiwei and Foreign Minister Ashida, making the relationship between the Social Democratic and Democratic parties superficially tend to reconciliation. However, on the other hand, the so-called "Economic Stabilization Headquarters Case" promoted by Wada as the center contradicted Katayama's opinion on the point of the 1,800-yen standard wage. As a result, when deciding on the successor to Agriculture Minister Hirano, the National Cooperative Party opposed it, and Nakayama Nomizo succeeded, causing the Socialist Party's left wing to take the position of the opposition party within the party and deepen its adverse environment. Although Katayama emphasized that the cabinet would not change in the slightest before the reconciliation conference, the actual shake-up had already begun. Moreover, there were external factors such as the active Conservative Labor-Farmer New Party movement, which made it necessary for Katayama to change policies, even if he did not step down. Therefore, the trend at the Socialist Party Congress to be held on the 16th is particularly noteworthy, and it can also be said to be the first hurdle that determines the fate of the Katayama cabinet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 6th dispatch] Conservative political parties in Japan are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards former Prime Minister Hirano's appeal to organize a new party. Hirano and the fifteen right-wing elements who withdrew from the Socialist Party at the same time encountered their first adverse reaction today. Minister of Communications and concurrently President of the National Cooperative Party, Miki, said that he would not participate in Hirano's new party. Informed sources said that Hirano had consulted with the National Cooperative Party and left-wing members of the Socialist Party on the organization of the new party. Miki denied that the National Cooperative Party had any cooperation with Hirano's movement to organize the new party. The Liberal Party also adopted a wait-and-see attitude, which was obviously because Hirano's qualifications for assuming official positions had not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Burmese President Announces; Major Policies; Building an Army to Resist Aggression; Promoting Friendly Relations with Foreign Countries</h3>

<h3>East Jo Maintains Arrogant Demeanor Throughout Trial; Claims Aggressive Actions Were Legal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] First-class war criminal Hideki Tojo still maintains that his actions were just and legal. The International Tribunal's four days of interrogation have failed to shake him. Tojo maintained a calm and arrogant demeanor throughout the trial.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Keenan questioned Tojo on whether he had committed any moral or legal crimes. Tojo retorted angrily, "I believe I have not committed any crimes, and I believe that the actions I took were just and legal." Keenan further pressed, "If you were released, would you take the same actions as before with your former colleagues?" Before Tojo could answer, the court disallowed Keenan from asking the question. Tojo expressed considerable regret about making Puyi the puppet emperor of Manchukuo. He admitted that Puyi was a treacherous person and that he lacked foresight at the time. Tojo also stated that after learning of Puyi's testimony, he did not believe any of Puyi's statements. Tojo again defended the Japanese Emperor, attributing all past blame to himself. He stated that the Emperor consistently desired peace, and even when war was unavoidable, the Emperor's attitude remained the same. The Emperor reluctantly accepted the opinions of Tojo and the General Staff.</p>
<h3>Audition Tickets for the Tojo Trial Sell for 500 Yen Each</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Tojo has even more appeal than Hollywood starlet Dorothy Lamour. The roughly two hundred spectator tickets for the Far East International Military Tribunal are being distributed for free by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to those who line up to request them, but they are being resold on the black market. Each ticket sells for 500 yen. The International Tribunal holds court once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for a total of six hours. The price to watch Tojo's trial is 1,000 yen, but the Japanese spectator seats are still often full.</p>

<h3>Substitute Senator from Jiangyin Arrested in Shanghai for Kidnapping; Unsuccessful Extortion of 5 Billion; Hostage Rescued in Wuxi; Reunion of Huang Baokun, Owner of Runfeng Rubber Factory, and Son</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Huang Baokun, 34 years old, the owner of the Runfeng Rubber Factory at No. 44, Lane 22, Changning Branch Road (i.e., Kangbianli), a native of Jiangyin, lived in the factory. His eldest son, Desheng, 7 years old, was a student in the second grade at Mige Elementary School in Caojia Wujiaochang. He was exceptionally intelligent, and his teachers favored him. On November 29th of last year, at 3:00 PM, after Desheng returned home from school, he was loitering at the entrance of the lane when he suddenly went missing. On that day, Desheng was wearing a dark-colored knitted shirt over a blue velvet vest and work pants. After the family discovered his disappearance, they sent people out in all directions to search for him, but to no avail. That evening, they reported the information to the Jiangning Police Branch Bureau. Unbeknownst to them, Desheng had already been kidnapped by bandits. That evening, they received an anonymous letter from the kidnappers, stating, "Your son has accompanied us, and he is safe and sound. Although he is lightly clothed, please do not worry and try to keep him warm." The letter also urged them to keep the matter secret. After receiving the letter, Huang Baokun was extremely frightened and knew that he had been kidnapped, so he reported to the bureau again. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Wang immediately ordered Section Chief Lin De to investigate the case urgently. Thus, detectives were dispatched in all directions, but without success. Until December 1st, they received another letter from the kidnappers, bearing the name "All Officers of the Southern Jiangsu Investigation Group, Jiangnan Branch." The letter stated that they were ordered from Northern Jiangsu to work in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, but they lacked funds. They demanded 2 billion legal tender. They said that it would be difficult to prepare this amount immediately and that they could negotiate. They would notify them again in the next letter. On the 8th, another letter arrived, bearing the name "Jiangnan Advance Command Headquarters, Nanjing-Shanghai Area General Headquarters." The letter stated that they assumed the previous letter had been received and automatically reduced the price to 1 billion yuan. They arranged to meet at the Baxian Garden in Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 11th and instructed the representative to carry a medium-sized leather bag in his hand. Their representative would hold a folded newspaper as a signal. They also instructed not to send factory employees or fellow villagers and that the number of people should not exceed three, otherwise, it would be detrimental to the hostage. After the victim sent the letter to the bureau, Section Chief Lin personally led Police Chief Li Zunzhi, Wu Dequi, police officers Xu Jintang, Zhu Enhui, and Lu Tianci on the evening of the 10th.</p>
<p>Travel by train to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Disguised, he coordinated with the provincial police bureau to dispatch a female police officer to lie in wait in the Baxian Garden. After waiting for a long time, the bandits did not appear. On the 11th, the family received a fourth letter, stating, "We are very grateful that you sent someone to negotiate, but the number of people was too large, and it was inconvenient to negotiate. If you are sincere, you must pay 5 billion yuan in legal tender and wait at the head of the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou, one li to the north, on the afternoon of the 15th." The police officers went to the reported location, but still found no clues. Section Chief Lin and others had no choice but to return to Shanghai and determine a new plan. On the evening of December 31st, the branch bureau suddenly learned that a fellow villager of Huang, named Bao Juxin, had recently come to Shanghai and was living in the factory. His actions were suspicious. Therefore, they ordered police officers Wang Qi, Gu Yin Xuan, and Zhang Yanxin to conduct a household registration check. They claimed that Bao had no identification and took him to the bureau for questioning. Unexpectedly, he confessed after being interrogated, admitting that he, his cousin Bao Kunru, and fellow villager Zhang Zhongyi</p>
<p>(From left) Bao Juxin, Bao Kunru (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Three individuals planned the kidnapping.</p>
<p>The hostage is currently being held at Bao Kunru's home at No. 10 Taqiao Bridge in Wuxi. On New Year's Day, police officers set off and rushed to Wuxi, where they successfully rescued the hostage and arrested Bao Kunru together. According to Bao's confession, Zhang Zhongyi lived in Room 15, Sanyizhan, Rixin Street, Zhenjiang. Police officers rushed to the location, but unexpectedly, Zhang had already left that morning at 8:00 AM, leaving a letter to Bao Juxin, which roughly stated, "I have been waiting for you for three days and am very worried. I am concerned if anything has happened to the goods (referring to the hostage). I am now in a hurry to leave and will come again tomorrow." The police officers stayed in the inn for two days, but Zhang did not appear. They then went to Zhang's home on Xinmalu Road, Huxi Road, Wuxi, but he had already fled with his family. It was later learned that he had gone to Maozhuang, Xiyang Bridge, Jiangyin. They rushed to investigate and arrest him, but still came up empty. The investigating police officers then took a train back to Shanghai. Later, it was discovered that the main culprit, Bao Juxin, was formerly the chairman of the Jiangyin County Farmers' Association and a candidate for senator. Moreover, the victim, Huang Shikun, was his nephew. Because he failed in business in Wuhu last winter and incurred losses, they secretly discussed the plan twice. The secret discussions took place in Anhui Xuan City in mid-September of last year and in Wuxi Park. It was not until November 29th that they began to carry out the kidnapping. In addition to him, Bao Kunru and Zhang Zhongyi were also present at the time. He identified the young hostage, and then Zhang stepped forward and falsely claimed that his parents were watching a movie and had asked him to pick him up. Desheng did not suspect anything and took a rickshaw to Zhenru, then a train to Nanxiang, where they stayed for two days, and then took him to Bao Kunru's home in the countryside of Wuxi. He then went to the Suzhou Beiju and stayed in the Nanyang Hotel for a few days before going to Wuxi. Later, because the situation was urgent, he came to Shanghai to inquire about the news, which led to his arrest. The police bureau is currently pursuing the escaped Zhang.</p>

<h3>Unite and Cooperate with Fellow Professionals; China Publishing Association Holds Inaugural Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Publishing Association held its inaugural meeting at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 100 representatives from various bookstores, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, World Book Company, Datong, Zhengzhong, and Kaiming, attended. Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, and Director of Education Li Ximou also attended. The presidium consisted of 17 people, including Zhu Jingnong, Tao Baichuan, Li Shihui, Lin Susu, Yu Wen, Ye Zhong, Pan Gongzhan, Liu Baimen, Ji Xu, Yin Weilian, Li Hongqiu, Zhang Che, Zhang Yiqu, Xu Weinan, and Li Bojia. Pan Gongzhan was publicly elected as the chairman.</p>
<p>Concentrate Efforts to Contribute to the Country</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Pan delivered a speech, stating: The Publishing Association has been preparing for several months, and it is now established. We should jointly review our past work and hope that in the future, we can achieve the effect of "collaboration" and work together with one heart. The cultural undertaking should make contributions to the country and the nation. Taking publishing raw material paper as an example, the quality of domestic paper is poor and the quantity is small. Most of the paper used for publishing relies on foreign goods. The preciousness of paper can be seen, and if it is not used properly, wouldn't it be a waste of foreign exchange? At present, world peace has not yet been established, the international situation is turbulent, and domestic wars are frequent. The publishing industry should be vigilant. The chairman clearly announced in his New Year's Day broadcast that the communist rebellion is a domestic rebellion with foreign involvement, and suppressing the rebellion and suppressing the communists is the spearhead of resisting future foreign aggression. The publishing industry and the cultural world should be the beacon of the people, so that the country and the nation do not go astray. It is hoped that all colleagues in the publishing industry will concentrate human resources, material resources, and intellectual power, unite as one, and make contributions to the country and the nation, and to suppressing the rebellion and quelling the chaos.</p>
<p>Encourage Colleagues to Eliminate Bad Elements</p>
<p>Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee then delivered a speech, stating that publishing and culture are the spiritual food of mankind. As an example, he said that he lived in a small village on the border of Hunan and Guizhou for two days during the Anti-Japanese War. There were only four families in the village, and there were no books or newspapers available for reading, which was extremely depressing. Later, he found a remnant page of the Shenbao from more than ten years ago, which contained several short articles. He read it again and again and cherished it as a treasure. This is enough to prove the importance of the publishing industry. The communists destroy the five relationships, massacre intellectuals, and destroy culture. The Publishing Association should severely attack them and protect culture. At the same time, colleagues should encourage each other and eliminate bad elements, etc. After this</p>

<h3>Suspected Case of an Old Nun Beaten to Death in Zhoupu; Coffin Opened for Inspection at Fu Yuan Hall</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of an old nun in Zhoupu's Wangguang Nunnery being beaten to death with a wooden stick by a nun from the Niangniang Temple, which caused a sensation, was reported by the Nanhui County Government.

<h3>Shanghai This Year's Conscription Division Garrison Received Orders; Conscription Method to Be Decided After Discussion by the Mayor, etc.; Commander Fu Zhengmo Announces at Reception</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Garrison District has been established for a year. Commander Zhengmo Fu held a reception at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon for leaders from all walks of life and reporters from various newspapers. Commander Fu gave a speech, expressing his gratitude to all sectors of society for their assistance in the conscription work over the past year, and presented three points, stating: The people in the communist-controlled areas are in dire straits, and we cannot sit idly by. To save people and save ourselves, there is no other way than to quell the chaos. The outcome of war depends on the coordination of politics and economy, but the main strength lies in eliminating the communist troops. Therefore, the replenishment of soldiers and the promotion of military service are the guarantees of constitutional governance and the foundation of national construction. This year's conscription will be based on past experience and strive to be more reasonable and ideal. Then, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, and others successively gave speeches. Subsequently, newsreels of new recruits enlisting in the army were shown, and the meeting ended at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>(Another report) Commander Zhengmo Fu of the Shanghai Garrison District answered reporters' questions at the reception yesterday, saying: The order for the first phase of conscription this year has been received. Except for Shanghai, the remaining counties under its jurisdiction will begin conscription work this month and must be completed before the end of March. The number of conscripts has generally increased compared to last year. The situation in Shanghai is more special. Last year, the conscription work adopted a method of enlisting volunteers, which was completed as scheduled. However, this method revealed some drawbacks. This year's conscription work will be carried out more cautiously. The method of conscription, whether it is lottery conscription or still enlisting volunteers, will be decided after discussion between Mayor Wu and the Military Service Association. The conscription work in this city will also begin after the method has been agreed upon. As for the quota for the first phase of this year in this city, it was learned from other sources by reporters that it is double the 3,000 names last year. According to Fu's disclosure, the second phase of conscription this year will begin in the second half of the year.</p>
<h3>Primitive Human Life Appears in Prosperous Shanghai; Half-Naked Cave Dwellers Subsisting on Wild Food; Waiting to Be Fed in Freezing Weather</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The life of primitive humans living in caves and eating wild food thousands of years ago has actually appeared in the highly developed Shanghai urban area with 20th-century material enjoyment. Near the old site of the South Railway Station in Nanshi, which was destroyed by artillery fire during the war, the wounds have not yet healed. Rubbish, dung, and grass are everywhere, a desolate scene. Recently, one or two hundred refugees from other places have gathered there. Except for a part of them who have built low-lying shacks with turf and mud to shield themselves from the wind and rain, most of the refugees dig holes in the ground and live in them at the original location of the station platform.</p>
<p>The remains of the platform have now disappeared, leaving only uneven mounds of earth and some cement remnants. The refugees dig holes in the mounds of earth to make their homes. The size of the caves varies, with the smaller ones only able to accommodate one person and the larger ones able to accommodate two or three people. The height is only half a body, so they must crawl in and out. Inside the cave, there are only a few sparse straws, and the dampness and darkness are self-evident. If it rains, the misery</p>
<p>Can be imagined.</p>
<p>The cave-dwelling refugees are all half-naked. Most of them come from disaster areas in Anhui. After arriving in Shanghai, they were expelled by the police for begging in the urban area. Now, they can only pick up vegetable scraps and other things near their caves to fill their stomachs every day. Not long ago, some students from a certain school went to distribute some winter clothing and rice. Therefore, when they see well-dressed people passing by, they assume that they are going to distribute relief and beg bitterly, hoping that the authorities will provide relief and shelter.

<h3>Suspected Secret Radio Stations in Two Locations; Cipher Codes and Gold Bullion Seized</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau received a report that someone was privately operating a secret radio station for foreign exchange speculation at 1340 Sichuan North Road, second floor.

<h3>Preliminary Decision by Three-Person Group to Discuss Food Relief Allocation Prices</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) The United States is donating 125,000 tons of relief supplies to China, including 75,000 tons of rice and 50,000 tons of flour and wheat. The first batch of 22,000 tons has already arrived in the city and the rest will arrive successively. The relief supplies are allocated to the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and this city has established the U.S. Relief Supplies Allocation Committee to handle the matter. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Wu Kaixian, representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ye Shifu, representative of the Ministry of Food, and Mattite, representative of the United States, held a small group meeting at the Social Bureau to discuss allocation methods. Wu Kaixian proposed a distribution plan based on the rice distribution method of the People's Food Allocation Committee, using the relief supplies to replenish the rice allocation for the poor, public educators, and professional groups. The U.S. representative agreed to the distribution principle but believed that the allocation price was slightly lower than the market price, in order to use the proceeds as a relief fund for our country's relief endeavors. Wu Kaixian stated that if the allocation price was too high, it would lose the original intention of the allocation. After exchanging opinions, regarding the allocation price, it was proposed to adopt a compromise figure based on the adjusted rice price to be decided at the People's Food Allocation Committee's regular meeting to be convened within the month, in order to imbue the relief supplies and relief endeavors with the same meaning. This draft plan will be formally decided after being submitted to the general meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Words of Non-Prosecution Document for Lou Guowei and Others to Be Published Today</h3>
<p>Lou Guowei, the former Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau, Wang Mingyi, the chief of the First Section, and other officials of the bureau, who were accused of suspicion of corruption, have been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Gu Ruilin of the District Procuratorate, and a decision was made not to prosecute them due to insufficient suspicion of criminal activity. The reasons for the non-prosecution are explored below: Regarding the collection of income tax for the previous year, former Director Lou Guowei adopted an auditing method and organized a review committee. After the Ministry of Finance and the District Procuratorate reviewed the committee's past records, they were found to be factual, and everything was carried out in accordance with the resolutions. As for the allegation that the committee extorted gold from businesses during audits, the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to investigate and found it to be untrue. Furthermore, the District Procuratorate's investigation also revealed that all businesses denied this matter. As for the allegation that Lou Guowei and Wang Mingyi led extravagant lives, this is a matter of private life and cannot constitute criminal punishment. Regarding the extortion of 24 gold bars from the exchange, calculated at the market price at the time, it would amount to hundreds of millions of yuan, which is obviously inconsistent with reason and lacks factual basis.</p>
<p>(Another Report) According to the District Procuratorate, the full text of the non-prosecution document for Lou Guowei and others is over 10,000 words long and has not yet been finalized. It has been decided to postpone the full publication until the afternoon of the 7th.</p>

<h3>The Municipal University: Pioneering a New Path for Social Education in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Guangzhou on the 4th] Guangzhou's "Municipal University" has been open for more than a month. This is not only a pioneering initiative in Guangzhou's education, but such an educational institution is probably rare in the whole country. This "university" is not like an ordinary university registered with the Ministry of Education. Its study period is only six months, and enrollment only requires registration without an examination. No bachelor's degree is granted after graduation, so although it is named a "university," its nature is really a comprehensive academic lecture series.</p>
<p>Promoting Social Education and Fostering a Research Ethos</p>
<p>The sponsor of this "university" is the Guangzhou Municipal Education Bureau. The bureau can be said to spare no effort in promoting various aspects of education. For example, the number of municipal primary and secondary schools has been restored to pre-war figures, and the number of students enrolled exceeds pre-war levels by one-third. This can be said to have achieved considerable success. At the same time, school education can also be regarded as reaching a stable stage, so in order to achieve balanced development, it has turned its attention to social education. In addition to the People's Education Center, library, museum, etc., which were established long ago, the National Sports Commission, the Broadcasting Arena, and the Cultural Education Department have also been restored or established one after another. Recently, in order to improve the intellectual level of citizens, promote social education, and foster a research ethos, it has established this "Municipal University" in accordance with the needs of the social environment.</p>
<p>No Colleges, No Departments, Only Twenty-Two Lecture Series</p>
<p>This "university" has no "colleges" and no "departments." It only has twenty-two lecture series, namely: Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Teachings, Public Opinion, New Life, International Issues, Party and Government Issues, Constitutional Government Issues, Social Issues, Economic Issues, Health Education, Social Education, Children's Issues, Women's Issues, Youth Issues, Municipal Issues, Overseas Chinese Issues, Border Issues, Current Affairs Commentary, Chinese History, History of Chinese Culture, Outline of Foreign History, Philosophy, and Journalism. Each lecture series employs famous figures from China and abroad to be responsible for lecturing. Students can freely choose which lecture series to attend.</p>
<p>Classes at 7:00 PM Every Night, Evening Parties Held Every Week</p>
<p>As for the internal organization of the school, there is only an Education Committee. The director of the bureau, Director Zhu, serves concurrently as the chairman of the committee. The head of the Social Education Section of the Education Bureau, Guo Jinglun, and the principal of the Municipal Normal School, Ren Xueming, are all members. Their class time is from 7:00 PM to 9:30 PM every night. A New Life evening party is held once a week for relaxation. There are currently more than 400 students, including out-of-school youths, civil servants, shop assistants, and people from all walks of life who generally enjoy research and learning, so their level of knowledge is naturally uneven.</p>
<p>If This Session Is Successful, Several More Will Definitely Be Continued</p>
<p>According to Director Zhu, this type of "Municipal University" organization is very popular in several countries in Europe. However, it has not been held in China before. Last year, Vice Chairman Sun of the National Government returned to Guangzhou and mentioned that when he was the mayor of Guangzhou, he planned to establish this type of "university" and instructed it to be prepared immediately. Therefore, this "Municipal University" can be said to have been established in accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Sun. He also said: After this news was released, there was a very enthusiastic response to registration. There are now more than 400 people, so classes have started first. In fact, there are still many people who have registered, but due to space limitations, too many people cannot be accommodated, which is a disappointment to some enthusiastic learners and a great regret! Finally, he also stated that if this session is successful, several more will definitely be continued in the future.</p>
<p>In today's serious education problem, if the organization of this type of "Municipal University" can be successful, it is believed that it will not only be of great help to education, but it will also have a positive impact on the overall social atmosphere to some extent.

<h3>Winter Congee Distribution in Bengbu</h3>

<h3>Why Did Qian Weiqing Borrow a Gun and Shoot Su Qing? Student Self-Destruction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Wujin on the 6th] In this county, on the night after New Year's Day, around 6:00 PM, in the dim twilight, a student shooting of a student occurred at the foot of the West Gate. This matter is quite tortuous and bizarre. The case has not yet been clarified as of the beginning of the year due to the suspension of office. The details are as follows: Su Qing, a high school student at the private Baiyi Middle School, does not study seriously at school on weekdays. It is said that he participates in some kind of organization and often attends meetings outside. On the afternoon of the 31st, he invited his classmate Yue Feng and Qian Weiqing from West Suburb Middle School in Wuxi, 18 years old, to see a movie at the West Gate Grand Theater. After the movie was over, they parted ways at the Huaide Bridge intersection. At 6:15 PM, Qian Weiqing was again invited to see Su Qing at the entrance of the Miqiao Elementary School, but he was not there. He circled around on the street and met Su Qing and Yue Feng. Then Qian accompanied Su to play at the West Gate, and Yue Feng left. Walking to the foot of the West Gate, while walking and talking, Qian Weiqing suddenly raised a handgun borrowed from Su Qing and fired a shot at Su Qing, hitting Su's lower jaw and head. Su let out a cry and fell to the ground. Qian immediately fled. Su was carried by passersby to Wujin Hospital for treatment and was still able to speak. He immediately reported the incident to the police station, which arrested Qian at West Suburb Middle School and seized a homemade handgun and four bullets. After interrogation and investigation, Qian Weiqing was suspected of premeditated murder and was sent to the city defense department for handling. However, according to Su Qing, Qian Weiqing was usually a very good friend. Qian Weiqing stated that he suddenly saw two people jumping down from the city wall in front of him at the south end of the city foot. At this time, Su Qing was walking in front, and he was very frightened by the people who jumped down, so he hurriedly took out the handgun, accidentally touched the safety, and the bullet came out, mistakenly hitting Su Qing. After the incident, he panicked and did not know what to do, so he threw it away. He usually has a very good relationship with Su, and so on. Su Qing, who was shot, has a swollen face, and the bullet has not yet been removed. One theory is that he developed murderous intentions out of jealousy. What is the actual situation is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Court Dispatches Personnel to Re-examine Rape and Murder Case; One Knife to the Throat, Head and Body Almost Severed, Jar Next to Corpse to Attempt to Destroy Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Wuxi on the 5th] On the morning of December 27 last year, Cai Jinshan, a resident of Hongshengli Town in the Dangkou District of this county, was beaten to death with an iron rod because of his adultery with Wang, the wife of Zou Fuwei. After the incident, the murderers Zou Fuwei and his wife surrendered to the local police station and were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The next day, personnel were dispatched to the countryside to examine the body. The results of the examination revealed many suspicious points. This matter did not seem like adultery, and the murderer's confession was also largely inconsistent. In order to re-investigate, the District Procuratorate appointed Prosecutor Zhu Guohua to lead the forensic examiner to re-examine the body in the countryside the day before yesterday. After Zhu carefully inspected the scene of the incident and questioned the victim's family and neighbors, he discovered many suspicious points. It was obvious that it was not a case of adultery, and the murderer had the intention of destroying evidence.</p>
<p>Bloodstains Everywhere</p>
<p>The location of the crime was in Hongsheng Lane. The house had seven courtyards, each separated by a courtyard. Usually, people entered and exited through the side doors. The murderer lived in the last courtyard. The prosecutor's examination revealed bloodstains in the front courtyard of the house where Zou lived. There were also bloodstains on the walls and floor of the living room. The corpse was lying in Zou's bedroom, and a large amount of blood flowed on the ground, which had coagulated. In addition to being cut by random knives, the victim's head was also cut twice, especially deep at the throat, about three inches long, and the wound was very clean, almost separating the head from the body. There was a medium-sized water jar next to the corpse.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Surrender</p>
<p>After the prosecutor finished the examination, he summoned Cai Hua, the wife of the deceased, and Tongju Xiaogen in the room. According to Shi, around 9:00 AM on the 27th of last month, Shi went out to soak clothes and returned home, seeing that the side door was closed. She knocked hard for about ten minutes before it opened. When she entered, she saw Zou Fuwei covered in blood, and Zou's wife, Wang, was wiping the bloodstains on the floor. Shi knew that something had happened and followed the bloodstains to the living room. Suddenly, she saw a foot of a corpse protruding from the door of Zou's room, so she ran out in horror to report to the town office. Zou also knew that he could not escape the crime, so he went out with his wife and surrendered to the police station, and so on. According to the deceased's wife, her husband had no major grudges with Zou during his lifetime, only a quarrel over trivial matters, which would not lead to murder. Also, Cai had suffered from paralysis before, but has now recovered, but his strength is still weak, and so on.</p>
<p>Chopping the Corpse and Moving the Corpse</p>
<p>After Zhu finished questioning, he continued to inspect the room and extracted the situation at the time. All the evidence was also taken to the court for storage. After Zhu returned to the city, he interrogated the detained murderers Zou Fuwei and his wife. Zou still insisted that he killed Cai in the room because of his adultery with his wife. After the prosecutor repeatedly questioned him and told him about the examination, Zou admitted that he chopped him to death in the courtyard and moved the corpse into the room, but he still insisted that the cause of death was adultery. Zou's wife, Wang, answered similarly to her husband, but claimed that she did not help him. After the interrogation, they were still detained. The truth of this case, which is bizarre and sensational throughout the county, remains to be investigated further before it can be clarified.</p>
<h3>Blood Case at Feilai Peak: Tea Drinker Chen Liugen Poisoned Female Hostess Tang Yuying</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Hangzhou on the 5th] At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, a blood case of murdering for money occurred in the air-raid shelter behind Feilai Peak. Tang Yuying, a female hostess from Shanghai Yong'an Company, met Chen Liugen, a tea drinker, while drinking tea. One day, Chen suddenly went to Yong'an and invited her to Hangzhou for fun. She politely refused, but Chen grabbed her collar and said that the tickets had already been bought and she had to go with him. Helplessly, she accompanied him to Hangzhou, where they stayed together at the Liangjiang Hotel for two nights. In the afternoon, Chen invited her to Lingyin Temple. At around 3:00 PM, they entered the air-raid shelter at Feilai Peak. Chen hugged her and took out a knife, stabbing her throat. She fell to the ground due to serious injuries. Chen then hit her left cheek, knocking her to the ground, and stole the cash of 3,277,000 yuan, three gold rings, a gold lock, a gold chain, and a one-tael gold bar from her purse. The police station at Lingyin Substation learned of the incident and immediately launched a search, arresting Chen on a rickshaw near Yue Tomb. Chen claimed that he and Tang were married and that his wife's death in the cave was an accident. The police station found Chen's statement suspicious and went to the scene of the incident and the Municipal Hospital to question the injured party. Only then did they learn the truth. Chen is currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Wujin Zhaizhai Town Security Squad Unsafe, Town Strike Demands Punishment of Culprits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Wujin on the 5th] Pan Zhe, the captain of the Second Squad of the Third Regiment of the County Security Forces, was stationed in Zhaizhai Town, Qianhuang District. Pan usually commanded the troops without proper method, and discipline was lax, which caused deep resentment among the people. On New Year's Day, the town had no rewards due to commercial depression and economic difficulties. The squad leader, Pan, held a grudge and, on New Year's Day, used gambling as an excuse to go to a teahouse where Pan Guozhen, the father of the deputy township chief, was settling taxes. He was beaten severely. He then went to the township office and beat Liu Shiyuan, a township official, severely. At this time, the Winter Defense Committee was holding a meeting to discuss expenses, and everyone was shocked by the situation, suspecting that the squad had mutinied and dispersing in confusion. The next day, Township Chief Qian, based on the information, reported to the district office and the regiment headquarters for handling. Unexpectedly, squad leader Pan Zhe had no remorse and instead kidnapped the deputy township chief under the pretext of inviting the township chief to talk, wandering in the wilderness all night. Upon learning of this, the district office strictly stopped them and sent a letter to the regiment headquarters. All the merchants and people of Zhaizhai Town believed that the squad was acting perversely and arbitrarily arresting civil servants. A strike began on the 3rd, and over 150 representatives were sent to the district office and county government to petition, demanding strict punishment of the squad leader. The security brigade leader, who was in Shanghai, made a long-distance phone call to mediate, promising withdrawal and punishment. The representatives then dispersed.</p>

Once collected, materials will be purchased and stored so that construction can be started actively during this agricultural off-season.</p>

<p>Li Huitang Visits Kunming, Discusses Participation in World Games Football Qualifying Round</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch] Although Kunming is said to be like spring all year round, the temperature has dropped since the winter solstice. According to incomplete statistics from the police, over twenty corpses of those who froze to death have been found near the city walls in recent days. Proportionally, this is a serious issue in Kunming.</p>
<p>Therefore, a winter relief campaign has been actively launched in Kunming. After several discussions among enthusiastic members of society and relevant authorities, it was decided to initiate a winter relief football and tennis charity match. Relying solely on local teams was deemed insufficient, so sports figures here thought of the "King of Football," Li Huitang. After numerous letters urging him to come, Li agreed, and on the 23rd, the "Air Overlord" plane brought Li Huitang and his second son, Li Yude, to Kunming.</p>
<p>(Photo of Li Huitang and his son Yude in Kunming - sent by our special correspondent Xu Jilian)</p>
<p>The Excitement of the Fans</p>
<p>This was a great excitement for the 300,000 citizens of Kunming, especially the football fans. The sporting atmosphere in the three Yi regions has always been very low, but the arrival of the "King of Football" was like a stone thrown into a calm lake, creating waves and ripples, attracting much attention and satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 25th, when the match began at the Zhizhou Sports Association, the crowding and excitement were probably only seen once before after a victory parade. It happened to coincide with Yunnan National Protection Memorial Day, which was a holiday, and the place was packed. Both the 20,000 and 50,000 admission tickets were sold out, and even the walls were full of spectators who didn't buy tickets, all to see the splendor of the "King of Football."</p>
<p>According to the charity match schedule, the Youxing team formed by the "King of Football" in Kunming will play a total of five football matches, in addition to four tennis matches. With the warm winter sun shining every day, three football matches and two tennis matches have already been played. Li Huitang's personal skills are beyond question, and although he is not as brave as he used to be, his son, Li Yude, has a "surpassing the father" feel. The Li father and son team has indeed caused a sensation throughout the mountain city. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Li Huitang and Son Leave Kunming for Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Our Kunming Office, 5th] The "King of Football," Li Huitang, and his son concluded their charity football and tennis performances in Kunming on the 5th. They played a total of seven football matches and four tennis matches, losing only one match by a small margin. The winter relief fund raised reached 600 million yuan. The Li family decided to leave Kunming for Hong Kong on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 6th] "King of Football" Li Huitang and his son, who were invited to Kunming before Christmas to participate in the winter relief charity match, returned to Hong Kong by plane today.</p>

<p>Resumption of Gold Ornament Trading: Silverware Industry Association Board Meeting Prepares for Business Resumption; Social Affairs Bureau Says It Has Not Received Official Documents from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Silverware Industry Association convened a board meeting yesterday to discuss the resumption of gold ornament trading, as approved by the authorities, and to prepare for the resumption of business. The meeting aimed to calculate the percentages for legal profits, operating expenses, wages, etc. After the meeting, all board members, led by Chairman Wu Pengnian, paid a visit to Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu stated that the bureau had not yet received official documents from the Ministry of Finance regarding the resumption of gold ornament trading, nor had the Silverware Industry Association received them. Therefore, discussions on the resumption of business seemed to lack a basis. It was decided to wait for the official documents to be issued before further discussions.</p>
<p>Measures to Strengthen Financial Controls to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>[Our Report] After the Executive Yuan approved measures to strengthen financial controls, the Financial Management Bureau drafted implementation steps and prepared various forms to be submitted to the ministry for review. As the ministry's order had not yet been approved, Deputy Director Bi Delin made a special trip to Beijing last week to seek instructions. He returned to Shanghai today and stated that the Ministry of Finance had received the Yuan's order and distributed it to various bureaus. The measures to strengthen financial controls would arrive soon. The Ministry of Finance has specific regulations for all forms. Once the bureau receives them, it will immediately notify all financial institutions to comply. The main focus of strengthening financial controls is to audit loans and remittances. Banks and financial institutions are required to submit daily reports and conduct weekly inspections to understand the movement of funds and find ways to channel them into production. Banks and financial institutions should pay special attention to whether borrowers meet the regulations when granting loans. If any violations are found, they will be dealt with according to law, and serious cases may be subject to a fine of up to 50% of their turnover.</p>
<p>Silver and Money Businesses Still Cannot Use Bonds to Meet Reserve Requirements</p>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the payment of reserve funds by silver and money businesses, the Ministry of Finance, based on the provisions of the Banking Law and considering the current actual situation, decided to implement six measures, effective from January 1st of this year. Subsequently, it was feared that the use of government bonds to partially offset reserve requirements would cause the outflow of cash used for reserve requirements, which would have a significant impact on the market. Therefore, it was specifically ordered that item 5 be temporarily suspended. The original six measures are listed as follows:</p>
<p>The reserve funds to be paid by silver and money businesses for ordinary deposits and savings deposits should be uniformly renamed "guarantee reserve funds" in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law.</p>
<p>The provisional ratios for deposit guarantee reserve funds for commercial banks and savings banks in various regions are set at 15% for current deposits and 10% for time deposits.</p>
<p>The ratios for deposit guarantee reserve funds for industrial banks should be determined after the business is legally adjusted and its nature is determined. Currently, they should temporarily be paid in accordance with the commercial bank standards mentioned above.</p>
<p>The ratios for deposit guarantee reserve funds for provincial, county, and city banks should temporarily be handled in accordance with the industrial bank regulations in the Banking Law. The payment ratios are temporarily set at 12% for current deposits and 8% for time deposits.</p>
<p>Silver and money businesses may use government bonds to offset deposit guarantee reserve funds in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Law. However, the government bonds used to offset deposit guarantee funds may not exceed 50% of the total amount payable. As for the valuation of bonds, national currency bonds should be calculated at 70% of their face value, and foreign currency bonds should be calculated at 50% of the foreign exchange market price published on the date of payment or adjustment.</p>
<p>The adjustment of guarantee reserve funds should still be carried out once a month, as in the past. Previously, the guarantee reserve for savings deposits was adjusted every three months, and it should be changed to once a month.</p>
<p>National Bonds Soar, Foreign Stocks Mediocre</p>
<p>Government bonds soared yesterday due to the stimulus of currency system reform. National Bond C rose from 31,200 yuan to close at 37,500 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, A and B bonds rose by 5,400 yuan, C bonds rose by 6,600 yuan, D bonds rose by 6,000 yuan, and E bonds also rose by 6,300 yuan. The transaction volume was 6 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks reported 3.1 yuan for Hong Kong Shanghai Electric Power, forming a mediocre situation, with narrow fluctuations and a lack of change. Foreign firms and securities firms had mixed activities. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Jardine Matheson paper and Carlsberg beer rose by half a percent, while Jardine Matheson textile, British and Chinese Corporation, and Wheelock Marden &amp; Co. fell slightly. Jardine Matheson rose slightly, and the rest remained peaceful.</p>
<p>Goods Exported from Hong Kong Must Prove They Have Been Settled in Foreign Exchange; Includes Tung Oil, Pig Bristles, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Sino-Hong Kong Agreement has been implemented since January 5th of this year. According to the agreement, for tung oil, pig bristles, tea, tin, cotton yarn, and vegetable oil exported from Hong Kong to any third country, Form CBC Sa (Revised) must be provided to prove that the relevant foreign exchange for the exported goods has been settled or agreed to be settled with a designated bank. The Hong Kong government will only allow the export after verification. The Business Department of the Central Bank recently issued Circular No. 122 to all designated banks, stipulating that from now on, businesses exporting the above-mentioned goods from the country to Hong Kong must submit the above form in five copies. After being signed by the designated bank, the applicant will retain one copy, which must first be stamped by the customs tax officer at the port of export. When the goods are re-exported from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government will use this copy for verification to allow the export.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 6th] After the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, there has been no significant reaction in the market here, and everyone is waiting for the next step from the government. According to economist Huang Yuanbin, who recently returned from the south, the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement mainly aims to prevent smuggling. However, the key to preventing smuggling lies in the excessively low exchange rate. Therefore, to prevent smuggling, the exchange rate should be adjusted first to increase exports.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Fluctuate; Yong Yarn Sees New Prices; Short Sellers Active Again</p>

<p>Cotton Merchants Host Meeting, Request Support, Cotton Stock Registration Not Yet Completed</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Cotton Commercial Association believes that the government's unified purchase of raw cotton hinders the industry's survival. It will host a tea party at 2:00 PM today on the 6th floor of the China Merchants Bureau to invite members of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, private yarn factories, economic experts, and the press to issue an urgent appeal, requesting unified support from all sectors.</p>
<p>Another report: The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee instructed the Cotton Commercial Association on the 27th of last month to handle the cotton stock registration, with a deadline of the 7th of this month. As of yesterday (the 6th), the association had not yet carried out the procedure. According to the person in charge of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the association's failure to comply with the law is inappropriate. The committee will adhere to the government's established policy and take effective measures if the legal procedures are not completed by the deadline.</p>
<p>Various Regulations for Yarn Management Expected to be Fully Implemented by the 15th</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yuan Liang, chairman of the Yarn Management Committee, met with reporters yesterday and stated that since the establishment of the Yarn Management Committee, there have been no established rules to follow, and everything is of an innovative nature. Therefore, efforts are being made to make various preparations to ensure that the execution of the committee's affairs is without omission. The committee is currently continuing to convene internal directors to expedite the drafting of detailed implementation rules and procedures for the collection and transportation of raw cotton, contract spinning and weaving, and distribution. It is expected that all regulations will be finalized and passed by the first committee meeting in ten days, and will hopefully be implemented by the 15th. At the same time, the committee will submit the regulations to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The committee currently has branch offices in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Tianjin oversees Shandong, Henan, and Hebei provinces. Hankou oversees Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. Guangzhou oversees Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Fujian provinces. More branches will be added as needed in the future.</p>
<p>Sales Are Brisk, Inventories Are Depleted, Fine Yarn Prices Rise, Cotton Cloth Allocation Prices Fall, People's Hearts Calm Down</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened steadily. As manufacturers on this street still had strong demand and buyers from other regions were also active, prices rose. The 42-count fine yarn was particularly active, with a significant price increase. Around 11:30 AM, the Textile and Construction Company suddenly announced its prices and accepted applications from the industry, which slightly softened people's sentiment. However, transactions continued to be brisk, and prices rose again. In the end, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn rose by 3.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 700,000 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened with continuous replenishment by the industry and wholesalers, and buyers from other regions remained active, leading to higher prices. 12-pound Lanji fine cloth opened at 1.285 million yuan. Buyers from the north and the Yangtze River region were very active, and prices rose to 1.295 million yuan. After 10:00 AM, the number of fabrics released by the Textile and Construction Company increased compared to the previous period, and the allocation price was also lower than the market price, which immediately caused people's sentiment to calm down and buyers to wait and see. In the end, Longtou fine cloth was 1.515 million yuan, a slight increase of 20,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths showed mixed trends, with the underlying tone being weak but firm.</p>

Digestion in the south market remained sluggish, and medium-grade white japonica rice and early indica rice fell by more than 20,000 yuan. Indica rice generally saw little change. White silver dollars were temporarily inactive. Flour was active in the north and continued to surge by 10,000 yuan. Bingchuan rice was up more than 10,000 yuan. Wheat bran was increasingly scarce, remaining firm. Soybean cake supply was low, and the trend was stable. Soybean buyers were active, but oil mills were cautious. The market was sluggish, and the price of soybeans was stable. Du Huang was sluggish and lost its luster, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung beans arrived in small quantities and rose by 10,000 yuan. Red beans had flat sales, and the price fell by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas saw a decrease in transactions and also fell by 10,000 yuan.

<p>Free Talk: My View of the Japanese - Jingwen</p>
<p>It has been just over two years since Japan surrendered, and a peace treaty has not yet been officially signed. However, news about Japan is gradually appearing in both domestic and foreign newspapers in important positions. The number of people concerned about the "Japan problem" is also increasing day by day.</p>
<p>In the past, Westerners once regarded Japan as an "enigmatic" country in the East, and the Japanese character was even more difficult to fathom. Japanese women, dressed like butterflies, were as docile as trained cats, while Japanese men often enjoyed killing and competition for pleasure. However, it is not necessarily true that all Japanese men are barbaric and all Japanese women are docile. For example, Japanese small businessmen are no less respectful to customers than Jewish businessmen in Shanghai, and some Japanese women have committed cruel acts of brutally murdering their lovers to satisfy their possessive desires.</p>
<p>In fact, there is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious about the Japanese. Japan's country may have had some mystery in the past, but this was only woven by Japan's feudal historical background and its national religion, Shinto. Separating Shinto from state affairs and liquidating the feudal background, Japan is just Japan, and you will no longer find her mysterious.</p>
<p>However, this work cannot be completed in a short period of time, and whether it can be completed is the real Japanese problem today.</p>
<p>But the Japanese nation does have one characteristic, that is, they are good at opportunism. To put it nicely, they have a strong ability to adapt to the environment. This may be caused by the physical living conditions of the Japanese nation. Because Japan is a small country with scarce resources, it cannot develop without being good at adapting to the environment. Therefore, their national character has fostered opportunism, which has further developed into a characteristic of grabbing and plundering.</p>
<p>The Japanese have a remarkably small mind, but their desire to possess external things is extremely great, which is a manifestation of this character. During the era of the closed-door policy, the Japanese strictly rejected all foreign things, while organizing so-called "Wokou" (Japanese pirates) to commit acts of theft and robbery on the coasts of China and Korea; but after the United States opened Japan's doors with cannons, she changed and imitated everything Western, thus giving rise to the Meiji Restoration era; During the decade or so after the Soviet Revolution and the Chinese Revolution, the Japanese intellectual and political circles once experienced a phenomenon of great activity among left-leaning elements, but after the rise of Fascism and Nazism, Japan followed suit. Although everything was a political adventure for Japan, it equally proved that the Japanese nation is good at opportunism.</p>
<p>Although Japan has been baptized by atomic bombs today, looking at the recent words and deeds of the Japanese, one cannot help but doubt how much the Japanese have awakened. Perhaps we cannot blame the Japanese, because although the world is full of illusions, conditions that Japan can use as opportunistic capital still exist. And the Japanese Bushido spirit emphasizes revenge. If the Japanese really harbor this psychology, then the real Japanese tragedy is probably still to come!</p>
<p>If the Japanese can develop from their unique characteristics such as flower arrangement, tea ceremony, Noh, Kabuki, cherry blossoms, and hot springs, and become an oriental Switzerland, using their clean and exquisite "shoji" (paper screens) to isolate all non-essential thoughts, then it will not only be a blessing for Japan, but also a blessing for world peace. Only one British Empire has completed the conquest of the world from an island nation in history, but the current Britain has long been retreating from the rapids. The world after this will probably no longer have such miracles. As intelligent as the Japanese, they should do more work to "green" Japan.</p>
<p>New Year's Cards - Koman</p>
<p>The New Year holiday has begun, and I have a few days of leisure. However, when I think about not having any money to spend, I feel disinterested. Bored, I open the drawer and rummage through a pile of New Year's cards sent by children, as if seeing innocent smiling faces and pairs of chubby little hands. Some were sent generously with a bow, and some were dropped off and then they ran away shyly. Especially the lower graders are more lovable. Some of them don't write their names, and some give you two or three cards. Flipping through them, a warmth rises in my heart. This is a unique and rare comfort for those who live by chalk dust.</p>
<p>Labor and drawing teachers use the New Year holiday to implement design teaching, guiding children to make their own New Year's cards early on. As a result, one is not practical, because both the sender and the recipient dislike them for not being beautiful and not being serious enough. Moreover, one child told me that buying a white card costs more than twice as much as a New Year's card. The clerk at the stationery store greeted me politely and said, "More than five thousand New Year's cards have all been sold out by your school's children!" Ah! Five thousand cards. If each card costs 500 yuan, what a number that would be!</p>
<p>The Chinese language teacher also teaches how to write New Year's letters in composition class, but the children don't know the meaning of New Year greetings at all. Writing articles is also a boring thing. Although "red plums bid farewell to the old year, white snow welcomes the spring" - a lot of materials were provided, it was still useless, and it was even impossible to grade. As a result, I congratulated myself.</p>
<p>Children "smoothly" or "tearfully" get money from their parents to buy New Year's cards to catch up with the trend. Some children, because they bought too few cards, have no choice but to "burn incense at whatever temple is available" and have to distinguish between "big and small" and "good and bad" to express the thickness or thinness of human relationships.</p>
<p>However, teachers who receive good New Year's cards gradually forget about them after a while and may not give the children any benefits. But some teachers who are dissatisfied because they did not receive New Year's cards bear ill feelings towards the innocent children, find trouble, satirize them, deduct points, and may even secretly "thump their foreheads"...</p>
<p>In the paradise of pure and innocent children, New Year's cards actually teach them to learn snobbery and hypocrisy!</p>
<p>"Single-Plank Bridge" - Wang Baili</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Banxiang of Shanyin was exceptionally talented. Once, on an autumn night, while lying on his pillow, he playfully composed a poem on the character "声" (sound) in the "single-plank bridge" style, creating twelve interpretations of the "Drunk in Peace" tune, each with unique feelings. The words read: "Loud locust trees make noise, regret for repairs makes noise, rustling leaves fall on the steps, broken window paper makes noise. Deep drums make noise, sparse chimes make noise, a flute across the small building makes noise, connected to the night watchman's clapper on the long street. The neighbor's dog barks, fish leap in the pond, chirping solitary birds roost, bamboo cage with geese and ducks makes noise. Insect girls give noise, tabby cats chase each other, crickets at the base of the wall chirp, rats in the empty beams make noise. The heavy door calls, the high building responds, villagers return drunk, listening to the closing of double doors. Orchid window scissors make noise, scholarly window reading makes noise, widowed young women sob, mixed with children's cries for milk. Buzzing intimate noises, mumbling dream noises, lilting small girl's charming noises, with parents' loving noises. Abacus beads clatter, silk looms weave, pine wind faintly roars, like the sound of a tea stove boiling. Wind rattles tiles, people leave their seats, window panels knock rapidly, imagining the lingering sound of a pipe. Bed hooks clink, window rings swing, galloping horses before the hall, like Ding Chang's jade pendants chime. Empty halls rustle, empty corridors whisper, wet soil under flower shadows with insect noises, making crawling crab noises. Distant noises, close noises, long noises, short noises, lonely quilts until the rooster crows, hoping for the morning bell from the temple." (See "Miscellaneous Records from the Cold Hut," volume 4)</p>
<p>Recalling "Changdian" (Part 2) - Ji Yong</p>
<p>Although I am from Beijing, I don't have any books on the local customs of the old capital. I only remember Zhen Jun's "Anecdotes of the Capital," and the earlier Liu Tong's "A General Survey of the Imperial Capital," both of which have excellent writing about this place. Xian Yuan Ju Nong's "Sounds of Goods in a Year" and Fucha Dun Chong's "Chronicles of the Capital" are even closer to the people. It just so happens that the three kinds from the Qing dynasty were all written by Manchus, and the sense of prosperity and decline described in them is thought-provoking. The temple market, which represents long-term folk customs, is roughly divided into three parts: the north-south line from Hepingmen to South Xinhua Street is a concentration of calligraphy and painting; the east-west area from Haiwang Village to Yangmeizhu Diagonal Street is the center of food, toys, tea, and sightseeing; and the cultural market, which specializes in expensive jade wares, is rarely visited except by high-ranking officials, concubines, wealthy prostitutes, and can almost be called another center.</p>
<p>Books are not cheap, because the stalls are also set up by insiders. Paintings are genuine only when they are fake, and genuine ones are hard to come by. Zhang Fei's masterpiece "Beauty" and Guan Yunchang's calligraphy can all be encountered here, but don't be fooled into thinking you are "traveling with the ancients." The sellers of paintings are usually more impressive than the book stalls, setting up very long and large reed mats, unlike the book stalls, which are exposed to the northwest wind all day long. Li Ciming's "Diary from the Yue Mantang" and Weng Wengong's diary both have many records of "visiting Changdian." The literary style of the Qing dynasty is now difficult to describe. Officials don't know what they are scheming, and university professors are shivering at the thought of 900,000 yuan per bag of flour. Liu Bannong obtained "He Dian" here, which seems to be a matter of more than three generations ago. In short, this requires not only money, but also "leisure." Walking around, you may not get anything all day long, but once you have a "strange encounter," it is not uncommon to gain ten in one day. In my early years, reading the letters and diaries of various families, I often read conversations with Yi Gu Xuan Tong, Liu Niu Nong, and Ma Yu Qing about their winnings, which once made the dull child yearn for them.</p>
<p>Let's talk about sightseeing and food. I really don't understand what so many people are doing there. Perhaps it's just what the "Water Margin" says, "Carriages and horses come and go, people watching people." This watching is important. Zhu Tong lost the young official, and in my experience, there were at least three or four times when I encountered families searching for lost people with yellow flags, knocking on bronze gongs to find their lost children. However, although it seems meaningless, the meaning lies in this. What we want is a little excitement, a little relaxation, a little news, a little change in the festivals and sacrifices, and it is still a peaceful scene. A poem by a person from the Ming dynasty says, "Flowers without peaches and plums are not spring, people with music and singing are peaceful." It is really a bit vulgar but elegant. In the center of Haiwang Village Park, there is a tea stall, built with wooden boards and without any shelter on all sides, offering a panoramic view from a high vantage point. Listen to the sharp deflation sound of the balloon sellers and the shouts of the candied hawthorn sellers. The candied hawthorns are surprisingly large, not for eating, but for playing. This is consistent with the mood of entering Changdian. If every rickshaw returning home does not have a few of these things smeared with white maltose or a sorghum windmill that makes a rustling sound, it is not enough. I used to hate children buying windmills and sticking them on doors and windows, disturbing the neighbors. Now, "this feeling can only be recalled," and I yearn for it instead.</p>
<p>There are also things that are more favored by children, such as wooden swords, ghost masks, and glass trumpets. The "A General Survey of the Imperial Capital" has a passage</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education, Following the Chairman's Instruction, Offers Relief to Students Coming from Border Regions, Starting in Beijing and Expanding to Other Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Ministry of Education, following Chairman Chiang's instruction to find ways to provide relief to young students from Xinjiang and other border regions coming inland to pursue education, has decided to provide subsidies. It will start with Beijing and then expand to other regions. This relief is due to the fact that many young students from border regions who come inland for education are facing extreme hardship due to financial difficulties at home. After consultations with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Organization Department, the Ministry of Education has been approved to allocate 113 million yuan. The funds for the relief of Mongolian and Tibetan students will soon be jointly distributed. Subsidy measures have also been drafted for students from other regions, and they are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the Chairman for approval.</p>

<h3>Municipal Normal College Students Accuse the Principal of Embezzling Public Funds; Strike Continues Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The issue of the reasonable treatment of students at the Municipal Normal College remains unresolved, and the strike continues today. The students are demanding that, starting yesterday, the meals be calculated at 300,000 yuan per month per person, according to the new standards issued by the Ministry of Education. They are requesting that the school temporarily cover the cost until the Ministry of Education releases the funds, and that the outstanding balance of the public funds for October, November, and December be issued. As of last night, the school had not provided a concrete response, only stating that the Bureau of Education had already issued all the additional funds for these three months. However, the school believes that the school suffered losses from the meal service provided by the school in October and November, and therefore withheld the funds. The school did not mention or issue the additional fees for December. Students are deeply indignant, accusing the principal of illegally embezzling student public funds. It is reported that the students of the school have announced that today's meal costs are gone as public funds have disappeared, and they have no choice but to continue the strike today. Furthermore, during the strike, the students are voluntarily holding various extracurricular activities, and the school order is good.</p>

<h3>The New President of the University of Berlin Hopes Our Country Will Send Students</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, Berlin (Airmail)] The University of Berlin, with its broken walls and bullet marks, is moving towards a new life. This reporter, introduced by Dr. Xiao Yunlai on the morning of the 22nd, drove to visit the new President, Professor Dersch. According to him, the University of Berlin has now restored ten colleges: Medicine, Law, Philosophy, Mathematics and Physics, Economics, Theology, Veterinary Medicine, Agriculture, Forestry, and Education.</p>
<p>Professor Dersch said that the University of Berlin suffered extremely severe burning and destruction during the war. In addition to the damage to the buildings, the most regrettable thing was the loss of the University of Berlin's collection of books. Professor Dersch, who was originally a well-known scholar of labor law, said, "Even taking books on labor law as an example, despite various efforts to collect them after the war, they are less than one ten-thousandth of what they were originally."</p>
<p>He also said that the Soviet military government is currently very interested in the reconstruction of the University of Berlin. The Soviet military government stationed in Germany has allowed all the University of Berlin's buildings to be repaired within one year. It is hoped that when school starts next fall (1948), it will be in the same condition as before the war, and the funds will be provided by the Russian side in installments.</p>
<p>Talking about the issue of professors, President Dersch said that most of the professors who participated in or were inclined to Nazism in the past have been expelled. Only a very small number who have special research in academics still work at the university. They may still be professors, or they may be renamed researchers, but the number is extremely small. At present, the total number of students in the school is about 5,000 to 6,000, and the total number of professors, associate professors, and lecturers is about 150.</p>
<p>President Dersch emphasized "academic internationalization" and welcomed Chinese students to continue to come to the University of Berlin to study as they have done in the past. It would be even better if they could be sent to Germany in large numbers. He personally had many oriental students, and he often felt that Chinese students were more lovely than Japanese students in the past. He said that when he taught at the University of Berlin before 1933, a certain Chinese student graduated and returned to his country. When he said goodbye, the party leader took out his notebook from his class. Therefore, his impression of Chinese students being "motivated to study" is unforgettable.</p>
<p>The University of Berlin is now in the Soviet military district and is deeply controlled by the Soviet Union. Foreign students must be approved by the Soviet military government to enroll, but there has never been a case of unjustified refusal. Before 1933, Professor Dersch was a famous professor at the University of Berlin. He was expelled after Hitler came to power because of his left-leaning ideas. Recently, Strucks was appointed as the president of the University of Berlin.</p>
<h3>The Public Education Center Will Hold an Exhibition of Modern Writers' National Paintings Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Public Education Center has recently collected more than 100 pieces of national paintings recently created by modern painters Wang Jiyuan, Yu Xiaolian, Zhu Nianxiao, Tang Yifang, Lu Yuanding, Huang Zongxiang, Chen Jiaxu, etc., and will hold a "Modern Writers' National Painting Exhibition" in the Dacheng Hall of the center from January 7th to 14th.

<h3>Elementary School Student Picks Up Money and Does Not Keep It</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wang Mingren, the physical education director of Qilu Elementary and Middle School on Ximen Road in this city, accidentally lost his gold ring when he was teaching physical education yesterday morning (6th). Miao Fang, a fourth-grade girl in the elementary school, accidentally found it and immediately handed it over to the school. The school recognized that the student picked up money and did not keep it, and her honesty was commendable. In addition to recording a major merit, she was also exempted from tuition for the next semester as a reward.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders All Levels of Education Institutions to Pay Attention to the Nutritional Problems of School Children to Avoid Affecting the Health of the Entire Nation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Bureau of Education has recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Education, which states that children are in a period of proper development and growth, and in addition to needing nutrition to maintain daily life, they also rely on it to provide the raw materials for growth and development, which is extremely important. During the Anti-Japanese War, prices rose and life was difficult, and the nutrition of the people was lacking. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, due to wartime destruction, all construction and recovery were not easy, and coupled with the chaos of the bandits, the people did not live in peace, and the nutrition of the people was still insufficient, which greatly affected the life of individuals and the health of the entire nation. Therefore, schools should pay special attention to the nutrition of school children. All countries attach great importance to the nutritional problems of school children, and some schools even provide food and nutritional supplements to school children, or the schools raise funds from local charities or student parents to handle it, and the Educational Administration Committee is responsible for the allocation and hires experts to take care of it, and the results are remarkable. My country's national economy has never been developed, and education funding is particularly stretched. Schools cannot afford to provide meals or nutritional supplements for school children, and most student parents are also unable to afford it. In order to promote this important facility, all levels of education institutions should do their best to supervise and guide. When conducting civic training in primary schools and holding meetings for school children's parents, various nutritional knowledge necessary for daily life should be imparted according to the economic environment, the time, the place, and the people, such as the distribution and selection of food, so that school children and their parents know what to pay attention to. If children bring their own lunch to school, the school should have a dining hall and kitchen to serve the children. It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau has recently ordered all schools to comply.</p>
<h3>The National Sports Committee of This City Employs Various Committee Members; The First Committee Meeting Was Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Municipal National Sports Committee held its first meeting at the Bureau of Education at 3:00 PM yesterday. Li Ximou, Xi Yuqi, Lv Guang, Peng Zhenqiu, Qian Xucang, Chen Mengyu, Jin Zhaojun, Shi Zhiqian, Xie Enshou, Shao Rugan, Wu Bangwei, Jiang Xiangqing, Shen Kunnan, Zhou Jiaqi, Qian Fugong, and more than 30 others attended. Hao Gengsheng, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, came from Beijing to attend.</p>
<p>Li Ximou's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Li Ximou reported on the past operations of the National Sports Committee and said that national sports in this city are still limited to a small number of people. In the future, we should strive for popularization. The current school sports performance is very different from that before the war and should be guided. National sports, as the name suggests, is not limited to schools or a small number of people, so sports halls and sports fields should be vigorously developed. A portion of the park should also be set aside as a children's sports field. The funding problem can be included in the city budget. In addition, popular games and ancient Chinese games can be promoted to make them popular.</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng's Speech</p>
<p>Supervisor Hao of the Ministry of Education then gave a speech, saying: Today's sports only have activities on the surface of large cities and have not penetrated deeply, so we should take schools as the starting point and work hard to promote them. After the implementation of the constitution, education funding will be secured, and a sports funding item must be included. The current school sports must be improved, and we must grasp school sports and develop social sports, so that people can continue to love sports for life after leaving school. Supervisor Hao also said that the National Games are scheduled to be held on May 5, and a preparatory meeting will be held at the Municipal Education Bureau on January 17.</p>
<p>Five Important Resolutions</p>
<p>After Xi Yuqi, Jin Zhaojun, and Peng Zhenqiu spoke successively, the discussion began and the following resolutions were made: It was decided to appoint Jin Zhaojun, Wu Bangwei, Shao Rugan, Xi Yushu, Jiang Xiangqing, Qin Xingshi, and Xu Tianxi as design committee members. It was decided to invite Wang Zhengting, Hao Gengsheng, Ling Xianyang, E Sen, Zhang Yi, Ou Yuanhuai, Zhu Jingnong, Xu Chongzhi, Huang Shaoxiong, Qian Muyin, Li Peitian, Shi Yuqing, and Xuan Tiewu as consultants. It was decided to appoint Shao Rugan, Xi Yushu, Chen Mengyu, and Lv Guang to nominate and hire economic committee members. It was decided to additionally appoint Rong Shizhao and Liang Zhaoan as members of this committee. It was decided to submit to the municipal government a letter to the China Textile Company for the allocation of cloth for uniforms. It was decided to submit a request to the municipal government to set up children's playgrounds and sports fields in various parks.</p>
