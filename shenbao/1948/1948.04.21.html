<h3 id="c1">國大提案全部審竣　提出今日大會討論　副總統候選人正式公告 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國大主席團廿日晚八時舉行第廿四次會議，劉峙主席，決議廿一日上下午均舉行大會，討論各組提案審査報吿，並推定薛岳·沈慧蓮分任上下午大會主席。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國大廿日除公吿副總統候選人外，竟日舉行分組審査會，全部提案八五八件，除十六·十七兩日審査約一五〇件外，餘均於廿日以最高速度悉數審査完畢，提出審査意見，定廿一日起由大會討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕副總統候選人孫科·于右任·李宗仁·程潛·莫德惠·徐傳霖，廿日上午九時在國大會堂門前公吿，其述署人數爲孫科五四〇人，于右任五一二人，李宗仁四七九人，程潛三三八人，莫德惠二一一人，徐傅霖二三二人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕關於國大閉幕後增設一常設機構之原則問題，業經審査委會審査通過，交廿一日大會中討論。廿日審查會中，對該機構之名稱，組織及任務均詳予討論，有關之提案共廿件，多數根據國大組織法第七條設立特種委會之規定，認爲在閉會期間應設立類似駐委會性質之機構，以繼續其責任。本日會中審査時，各代表就此問題發表意見甚多，最後通過之審査意見，係決定設兩特種委會，審査意見全文如次：「本會閉會後，爲考核憲政，硏議憲法，以供臨時會討論修改憲法時之準備起見，似有設立憲政考核委會及憲法研討委會之必要，全體代表參加，組織詳細辦法由主席團提請大會決定之」。討論時，有對此機構之設立恐陷憲政實施促進委會之覆轍，無所成就，反耗費公帑不貲，故常經多數人發表意見，均認爲該兩委會之組成必須愼重，且必須係無給職，認眞做事，認眞硏究，俾兩年後臨時會中之修憲問題不致草率從事。</p>
<h3 id="c2">第一審委會建議　國大閉會期間　增置常設機構　通過革新政治嚴懲貪污案 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕第一審査委會廿日晨九時四十分在大會堂舉行，出席代表三五七人，林紫貴主席，宣布開會後，首先由主席說明本審查委會應行審査之提案共一六三件，以性質分，共爲六類：（一）有關國民大會本身問題者，計廿四件。（二）有關憲法者十件。（三）有關行政者五十九件。（四）有關司法考試者十一件。（五）有關地方自治者廿件。（六）其他不屬以上各部份者卅九件。茲因案件過多，如逐案討論，勢所不能，故經召集人會議決定採取分類討論。其後，（一）召集人說明，（二）各委員發表意見，（三）召集人歸納意見後提大會討論。旋即開始由各召集人說明：張知本說明有關憲法部門之提案。張氐稱：分析其中有關於下次大會會期者，有關於修憲者，有關於臨時條款者等共五類十案。富伯平說明有關國民大會及一般行政兩部份。有關國大者約分修改國大組織法，修改國代選罷法，大會閉幕期間增設機構者及國代待遇問題。共中尤以增設機構案件最多，所擬定之名稱即達七種。有關一般行政者，爲刷新政治之原則，行政機構之增設等。林彬說明有關地方自治部份，爲省縣自治通則及迅速完成地方自治等數點。鍾介民說明司法考試部份，共計十一案，較爲簡單。羅文謨說明其他各案，共計卅九案，因包括廣闊，無法分類，故較複雜。各召集人於說明完畢後，即開始發言，廣泛發表意見，綜計全部發言人數爲廿二人，其中大多對憲法修正案之轉移問題有所引伸，而認爲閉會後之增設機構勢所必要。惟發言者所提意見中，對該機構之名稱均不一致，對委會組成人數之多寡及應爲有給職或無給職，亦各有見地。如李鴻儒所稱，籌組憲法審議委會，由國府騁任本屆代表，即屬有給職。潘公展則稱，組織機構，審査硏究憲法，爲事實所必需，且在國大組織法第七條內亦已列入「於必要時得設特種審査委員會」故可請大會設特審會即可，其名稱或爲「憲法審査委會」，由該會經常就修憲案予以硏討後，於卅九年臨時大會時，提出具體報告，交臨大討論。潘氏反對駐會委會之設立，因與憲法及國大組織法無所依據。其次潘氏認爲人數應少，且爲無給職。劉家樹則認爲應設立憲政實施督導機構，由國府聘請全體國代担任之·孫亞夫認爲常設機構可以設立，但必須人數少，不必政府騁任，更不必爲憲政實施促進委會之龐大組織。史尙寬亦認爲特種委會可以成立，但必須不支薪。最後由主席宣布時間已遲，頃發言代表中曾有若干人提出將　　各項意見交由召集人整理，擬就審査意見草案後，再交審委會討論，徵詢會中之同意，主席並稱：草擬時必特別重視各代表之意見，對組織機構等問題予以包括，旋即散會。</p>
<p>下午三時五十分繼續舉行，富伯平主席，將召集人會議所整理之初步審査意見提會討論，計共一六〇案，己分別擬具初步審査意見，一一提出討論，其中最重要者爲大會閉會期間之增設機構問題，經較長時間之討論，始獲通過。「關於從速完成地方自治案」，多數對省縣自治之實行均甚積極，故希望對各項準備能從速完成，其餘各案則均順利獲得通過，重要者有關於革新政治，嚴懲貪汚，整飭吏治，裁併駢枝機關，建立人事制度，改善公敎人員待遇，確保人民基本自由權利，均分肌送請政府辦理或參考。至有關決定下次會期，有關修改憲法部份，有關制定動員戡亂臨時條款及授權總統等案，則以大會均已有所決定，不再討論。</p>
<h3 id="c3">請願案件　國大依法不接受 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕第一屆國民大會第一次會議以來，先後收受之請願案件己有多起，大都屬於治權範圍之事項，依照憲法所賦予大會職權之範圍，均不能有所決定。頃悉：大會主席團於討論此類請願案件時，除將收受各案轉送政府外，並決議凡請願事項大會依法不予接受，應逕向政府主管機關呈訴。</p>
<h3 id="c4">主席電謝居正 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕蔣主席頃電復居院長正稱：居覺生先生道鑒，十九日電誦悉，忝膺推選，念時會之艱難，感責任之益重，先生老成碩望，尙盼時惠南針，俾匡不逮，爲幸，敬電肅謝，蔣中正，四月廿日府交。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江廿日電〕蘇主席王懋功頃奉元首手啓，以行憲伊始，國難正殷，實非慶祝之時，而人民困苦如斯，尤不宜有舖張塲面，浪費人力，財力，物力之舉動，對於新政府選出及總統就職萬不可有所舖張，務望共體時艱，切實遵照，即或民衆團體自行發動，亦望切勸從備，從儉，省府奉電後已通令所屬，仰體元首意旨，一體遵照。</p>

<h3 id="c18">社論　希望早日召開對日和會 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>國民大會十七日舉行的審査會，修正通過「爲請政府確定對日和約原則，早日召關和會，以資奠定世界和平而衛國權案」一案，送請政府注意。本案全文己誌十八日本報，內容計分兩部份：一是對日和約之準備，即和會召集的程序問題；一是和約內容及序文要點，即和約條款的重點問題。正當對日和會預備會的召開問題陷於分歧，我國朝野冀求打開此一僵局的時候，國民大會通過本案，足以說明我國億萬人民對於日本問題的關切，以及對於日本和約內容的重視。</p>
<p>對日和會召開問題，是現階段遠東外交最複雜最緊要的問題，在過去半年之間，美英蘇爲了程序問題的爭執，意見紛歧，險象環生，已經到了僵持的局面。君目前種種的跡象，美蘇胸有成竹，各有打算，祗有我們中國在兩極夾攻中，形勢最感不利。近月來美國扶助日本的積極，幷不惜變更遠東委員會管制日本的計劃，是爲了對抗和會的僵局。美國似乎不需要對日和會的召開了。如果這個僵局不亟謀打開，美國扶日政策必將繼續發展，其結果，必將造成盟國的分裂，甚而擴大遠東的危機。我們中國不願見盟國的分裂，尤不願見遠東再度的烽火，所以我們的立塲，是冀求美蘇對於日本和約問題的協調，而早日完成和約的簽訂。國民大會通過的提案，表徵了這個呼聲的强大，我們希望當局，同時也呼籲美英蘇三國，運用智慧，放大眼光，覓求妥協，迅速召開對日和會，以免遠東危機的滋長。中國人民的呼聲，是誠摯而洪亮的聲音，國民大會通過本案的原則，是最低限度的要求，無論如何，都應該得到回響的。</p>
<p>關於對日和會的程序，國民大會通過的本案，有兩項原則，切實而合理。其一，表決方式，四强應完全保有否決權；其二，和會地點，應在中國境內召開。這兩項原則，與去年十一月廿八日，蘇聯答覆我國通牒的內容，大致相同。蘇聯同意我國十一月十七日建議，表示對日和約之決定，必須經中美蘇英四國代表之同意，但牠强調和會預備會議之前，四强應在中國舉行一次外長會議，討論對日和會的籌備事項。中蘇聲明所不同的，中國主張由遠東委員會担任和約之起草，四强保有否決權；而蘇聯主張四國除外的其他會員會，參加和會可能設立的各委員會及小組會工作，和約起草由四外長會議負責。因爲美英反對中蘇兩案，致和會預備會之召開陷於僵局。這次我國國大的建議案，並未涉及遠東委員會的關係，是否與蘇聯的意見較接近一步，冀以中蘇一致的原則，去換取四國一致，圖謀打開和會預備階段的僵局，尙有待外交當局的研討。</p>
<p>關於對日和約的內容，國民大會通過的本案，共分政治，經濟，軍事，領土，賠償，思想，管制，監督執行八類，是一部完備和約的綱目。細視各項原則，是以開羅宣言波茨坦宣言的規定爲精神，以澈底消滅日本經濟武裝，思想武裝爲主幹，而達到和平的民主的日本之建立，是很合乎理想的。除少數原則有待商榷外，大多是合乎我國人民要求的主張。例如：政治方面，確立和平民主之政體，所以必須廢除天皇制；經濟方面，澈底消滅軍事工業之潛力，所以要擴大賠償。至於工業水準之保留，以一九二八八—三〇年為度，是否正確，則有待專家硏究。領土方面，主張限於本州四國九州北海道，則比較稍苛。因爲開羅及波茨坦宣言，日本本土「鄰近之小鳥」，在不包括琉球在內的原則下，均應爲日本所有，這是與日本人民生存與滋長有關的一個問題，實有待縝密硏討的必要；軍事上注意取締武裝潛力之存在思想上注意防止軍國思想之復活，更配合以嚴厲之管制，這都是爲了澈底消滅日本經濟武裝和思想武裝而設定的。至於管制時間，本案主張五十年管制，似覺過是。管制日本之目的，乃爲監督和約條款的有效實施，並不需要五十年。過去有人主張以廿五年至三十年，爲監州督日本對和約之履行，是比較合理的。</p>
<p>總之，國大通過的本案各項原則，大體是正確的，它是我國民間的要求，而且是比較有條理的一種主張，値得中外的重視。現在對日和會召開問題，由於美蘇意見的分歧，成了僵持之勢這個僵局繼續發展下去，遠東前途將不堪設想。我國希冀此一僵局的打開，無論在朝在野的人士，都拘有同一的希望。國大通過本案後，送請政府注意，採擇辦理，我們願望本案的提出，外交當局再謀打開對日和會僵局而努力。同時，我們也期望盟國政治家，珍視我國民間的呼驟，爲重建遠東和平負起責任，打開目前的僵局，早日召開對日和會！</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕最近若干專科以上學校學生向政府當局請求全公費，甚至發生絕食遊行等行動，茲據敎育界某權威與記者談稱，世界各國絕無供給專科以上學校學生全部伙食的先例。而有志向學之靑年，大抵皆以其目身勞力之所得，供其求學費用。各國因半工半讀而獲有成就的偉大人物比比皆是，即我國在抗戰以前，亦復如是。且公費制度實施的結果，使學生膳費及公費在整個敎育經費項下佔了一個驚人的數字。根據最近的統計，全國公私立專科以上學校學生公費四月份即需二千八百六十億元，（連同省私立專科以上學校己有公費生在內）而同月專科以上學校經常費臨時費僅七百九十一億元，員工生活補助費爲四千零五十五億元，共爲四千八百四十六億元，與學生公費相較爲一·六與一之比，，即學生公費佔高等敎育經臨費百分之三十五强。</p>
<p>最近蔣主席和各國立大學校長聚餐時，曾說敎育經費決定再行增加，余（某權咸自稱）認爲以後敎育經費應以最大比數用在基本敎育上，用在掃除文盲上，因爲一假子女受到基本敎育的公民，要他納稅來供給一個大學生的伙食，不但不合理，而且不公平。國家進入憲政階段，如有財力應該以全力推動國民敎育，才是正當合理的辦法。</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕國民大會堂莊嚴偉麗的門首壁上，在四天前，張貼起總統候選人公吿的地方，廿日又換上了副總統候選人公吿。公吿的式樣和文字，大體相同，所不同的，是副總統候選人名單共列了六位：孫科·于右任·李宗仁·程潛·莫德惠·徐傅霖·總統競選只有二人央加，用一句俗語來說，當然是一面倒。昨天選舉的結果已證實了這點。副總統競選是六人爭雄，職位仍祗是一個，這六位中祗能有一位是當選者，這幸運究將落在誰的頭上呢？選舉要在廿三日舉行，結果要廿三日中午以後揭曉，選舉的前幾天，競選白熱化，當無疑義。</p>
<p>其實，副總統競選活動，早在一個月以前便展開了。由宣傳而進入實際活動，則是大會開幕以後的事，尤其距選舉日期愈近，活動愈熱烈。在這六位競選者中，正如次序先後所到，在前者活動最多，在後者活動最少。孫副主席以一迎串的分批招待國大代表，每次招待都發表一篇不同的演說：于院長，李主任，程主任的招特較遲，但亦一一舉行了，祇有莫委員招待最遲；徐委員的競選，正如他自己所說：「爲避免許多麻煩起見，不如自己參加競選。」所以他的活動最少，少到幾乎沒有。除了宴會之外，還有廣播，演講，拜會，訪問等等。孫副主席和于院長的宣傳攻勢最猛烈，大會堂對面左右兩側的巨幅油畫像，最能獲得代表和市民們的注意。廿日淸晨，于院長的宣傳車也出現在街頭，巨幅汕畫像之外，還加上擴音廣播，引起不少市民圍觀。報紙宣傳顯然也分開了陣營，明限人對他們的態度可一望而知。</p>
<p>當簽署提名辦法公布時，第一回合的短兵相接在會塲裏展開。簽署書是要代表們簽名的，吃飯，招待，看電影，送墨寳，效力似乎抵銷了，簽署要憑當塲拉。有的單位用平均分配法，每位分配若干代表簽署，有的代表用來者不拒法，人人照簽，不管有無效力。當時活動簽署的人固是滿心鞦喜，但到十九日午夜，却使主席團大傷腦筋。當顧毓琇等十二位主席負責檢査提名書的簽署時，却發現八百八十四個重複的名字，用「來者不拒」法的代表，全在三份，四份乃至六份提名書上簽了字，孫科提名書上作廢的名字最多，是二百五十人，徐傅霖也有十八個作廢。這還是廿日淸晨二時的統計，主席團這時還有五十封信沒有拆。這種信件都是對簽署有所聲明的。某代表在給洪蘭友的信中便寫道：「我本來是簽署孫副主席，爲了情面，不能不簽署了于院長，請洪在審核名單時，以簽署孫副主席的爲準·」由此，可見這第一回合競爭的熟烈。</p>
<p>到候選人提名公吿時，這六位競選者的身份算是確定了。激烈的競爭，則將於未來的三天中展開；投票與簽署不同，依照選舉時的單記名辦法，每位代表祗能選定一人，除非打算　選票作廢。而每位代表的抉擇，將在拿起選票拿起筆來的一霎那間。除了眞正的群眾，眞正的擁護者，在圈選時不會有疑義外，其他遊離代表的抉擇，將決定這六位的未來命運。</p>
<p>選舉結果如何，現在無法預測，但簽署人數的多少，可以作爲參考資料；依照總統，副總統選舉罷免法的規定，副總統選舉程序與總統選舉程序相同：「以得代表總額過半數之票選者爲當選。如無人得前項所規定之過半數票得，就得票比較多數之首三名重行投票，圈選一名，如無人當選時，舉行第三次投票，圈選一名，如仍無人當選時，就第三次得票比較多數之首二名圈選一名，以得較多票數者爲當選。」許多人估計：副總統選舉，因爲這六位中，除去一二位實力較差外，其餘大多相等，將不若總統選舉之簡單，可能進行投票四次。</p>
<p>候選人的命運如何？代表們的抉擇如何？還要看選舉前夕三天中的努力。（四月廿日於南京）</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十九日電〕美國原子能委員會頃發表簡短文吿，宣布美國業己在太平洋內之馬紹爾羣島之埃尼威托克珊湖島上，舉行新原子武器之試驗，成續殊佳。該文吿並曰，由於安全理由，試驗日期未能宣布。此次試驗係根據一九四六年原子能法案之安全限制規則而進行。關於該次試驗之其他情報，一時不允公開發表。</p>
<p>原子能委會之文吿，繼乃檢討此次試驗前之發展，謂自去。年十二月起，埃尼妙托克島即開始新原子武器試驗塲之建造，陸海空軍合組之機動部隊，於一九四七年冬末即己完成在該試驗塲之建築，大規模的設備，已安置在該處，以供科學及技術團之用。該試驗塲之主要目的爲對於改良後的設計，予以科學及工程上的保護。該試驗塲之科學及按術試驗，可提供新的基本情報，對核心分裂供和平使用的原理及原子能之軍事效能，能獲更廣泛的諒解。原子能委會之官員對該次試驗詳情，均拒絕有所透露。科學界人士確信所試驗之新武器，已使核心分解原理，較原子彈己有更進一步的發展，在原子能的發展方面已完成驚人的進步。最近數週來最普遍的揣測，乃爲美國將作原子彈深水爆炸之試驗，其主要目標在試驗潛水艇對於原子武器之抵抗力。按前此已爆炸之原子彈，外界所知者共有五枚。第一枚於一九四五年七月十六日在新墨西哥之沙漠中試投，第二枚投於廣島，第三枚於一九四五年八月九日投於長崎，一九四六年六月及七月在比基尼島試驗原子彈時共投兩枚。此次在埃尼托威克所試驗者，係原子炸彈抑其他形式之武器，尙無從探悉。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十九日電〕科學家愛因斯坦現表示擁護第三黨華萊士當選總統，該黨認爲美國已具有充分之軍事優勢不應再有其他野心，故愛因斯坦是否仍願爲改進原子彈而努力，殊成問題。科學家咸信增加現有原子彈之威力，或另行製造千百倍强烈之新型原子彈，均屬可能之事，但此事目前尙無實現之望。政府前曾宣佈原子彈效率大爲增加，僅指生產過程而非指其效率而言。若干人士咸信此次不過係普通之實驗，並無任何新型武器在內，此次實驗結果證信陸海軍特種部隊有實行合作之必要。此特種部隊之存在，迄今尙保守秘密，此次試驗結束後，其他試驗仍將陸續舉行。原子能委會提出警吿，埃尼威托克區在一九四八年將永爲危險區域，杜魯門總統下令原子能委會指導員之任期延長，其意圖至屬明顯，彼蓋欲保守原子發展之秘密，使此項智識僅爲極少數一部份人所獲悉。</p>

<p>路局員工待遇向依公敎人員指數計算，另加事業津貼三成，及米貼八斗，（職員技工八斗，普通工人六斗，藝徒與侍應生四斗）。房貼一律米二斗五升，四月份起指數增漲爲二十四萬倍，交部訓令所有房貼，米貼一律取銷，鐵路工人得悉此訊後，屢次集曾商討對策。局方因恐此項規定對工人過於刺激，暫不公開發表，因此工人情緒愈不安定。昨日爲路局之發薪日，（發薪日原定每月十日，廿日，但習慣上常提早一二日發給）工人急於明瞭究竟，晨八時半機務工務兩處工人即在烏鎮路橋工人俱樂部舉行會議。此時局方亦已得訊，該局謝副局長即召集局中高級職員會商對策，並電吿在京之陳局長。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥工業公會，爲使外界明瞭當前水泥工業處境，特由會員工廠中國水泥公司，招待記者實地參觀該公司所屬龍潭水泥工廠。該廠三面環山，面積二千餘畝，廠址所在各山，屬石灰石性質，業由該廠取得開採權，估計可連續開採達二百年以上，水泥主要原料之供應，殆可長期供應無虞。</p>
<p>該廠現有經常工人三百餘，臨時工人四百餘，最高產量爲每日四千五百桶。近向美購得新設備全副，運華安裝後，每日又增產三千桶。該廠現共有巨型　四座，惜因電力不敷，未能全面開足。記者實地參觀時，見部份生產設備，均吿呆擱。</p>
<h3 id="c82">配給日用必需品　事實上困難殊多　審議結果暫緩辦理　建議中紡平價配布疋 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕生活指數編製問題硏究會日用必需品配給審議小組，昨在社會局舉行會議，由顧炳元處長主席，討論具體配給計劃，結果認爲計劃中擬辦理配給之日用品醬油，紙烟，木柴，食鹽，肥皂，草紙，火柴，綫襪等八項，配給時技術上困難過多，而在生活指數中所佔份量甚少，若必欲辦理，恐將得不償失，因此決定暫緩辦理。至棉布一項所佔比率最重，佔九種日用品總額三分之一，但民營各紡織廠以缺乏原料，無法供給布疋，故決議建議政府由中國紡建公司舉辦平價配布。據顧處長表示：九種日用品在指數中之總百分比，僅佔百分之十八，縱全數配給，對指數影響甚小。照指數計算方式中，每月有火柴四盒，木柴卅三市斤，坯布一尺，色布四尺，綫襪半雙，紙烟十五包，肥皂四塊半，草紙一·三三刀，醬油六斤，食鹽四斤半，若以全市工人六十萬人（產業工人四十萬，職業工人廿萬）計算，全部資金需六千二百五十六億元，平均每工人約需一百零四萬元，如所配物品稍不合用，反而不甚實惠，現爲工人利益與配給時事實上之困難，故決定打消辦理日用品配給之原意云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據有關人士表示：經濟部接收之日本賠償物資，迄今己有工作機器一千件以上，但民營廠家申請配購之數量，至少在三倍以上。故將來之審査工作，異常煩重，下月內未必能完全辦竣。至於審査之標準，一方面視申請工廠之成績與歷史，決定其是否有能力運川賠償物資，同時亦視其是否有充分財力，能按照契約如期付款。目前抵滬之民用物資，仍全部保存於招商局第七碼頭倉庫。工作機器中，大型有重達八九噸者，平均亦達四噸左右。將來配售民廠之價格，決以美元計算，但評價委員會之工作，此間尙無所悉。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕滬西大西路三四五弄卅五號好萊糖果廠經理兼技師楊景周，上月間由中合產物保險公司介紹，赴台灣興合企業公司管理之六一糖廠考察，本月三日，由該公司派員陪同搭中興輪赴台，九日接自基隆來電謂十日搭輪返滬，不料延至十三日好萊廠中突接本埠民生公司電稱，該公司之民衆輪，由合啓椗來滬，有旅客楊景周者已於中途失蹤，遺有皮包一只，嗣經好來廠派員至當時同艙返滬之旅客烏鶴鳴（寓寗波東路十二號）吳長生（寓老大沽路一八三弄十六號）等處調査，證明當楊登輪之時，曾見數人阻其離台，並奪其船票，雙方爭執良久，該船啓程後，楊曾與彼等談話，比至翌晨二時後，突告失蹤，不知所終云云。廠方現已派員赴台調査此一離奇失蹤案，一方投報港務緝査警衛組及警察局飭査內幕眞相。昨據好萊廠中負責人云：楊係上海人，年四十七歲，早年畢業於聖約翰大學，對於製造巧格力糖，獨具心得，冠生園延爲顧問，前曾在外商沙利文廠爲技師四年，一度由該廠派往日本考察，製造巧格力糖，回國後悉心硏討，精益求精，華商糖廠倣造巧格力糖，內部坯料，大都向其購買，故廠方聞耗後，亟派專員塔機飛臺調査眞相，大致今日可返滬。在其遺留皮包中置有日記簿新約聖經及信件數通，致其廠中友人一函云「我在他響，無法可想等……」而夾入聖經內一字條，上寫「天父！天父！有救無救，生死大數」等數語。復翻閱其日記薄僅誌事至九日爲止，現上述證件已交由律師代爲保管，聞楊有簡單行李，尙在台灣六一廠中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市七浦路三一四號胡興華翻砂廠技工文光廷，前因被新市街警察分局以盜匪與竊盜罪移解地方法院偵審，經曹祖慰推事審理後，於一月二十四日宣判無罪，其餘部份不受理，當庭諭知交保，由法警徐敬寬帶至昆明路五九四號合興翻砂廠覓保。據法警回報，該廠不肯作保，曹推事遂諭知繼續覊押。</p>
<p>近文光廷在思南路看守所中，具呈市參議會人權保障委員會控訴新市街警察分局義警曹保生及該局便衣警士等惡意誣陷，非刑逼供，曹祖慰推事與法警徐敬寬有勾結索賄情形。</p>
<p>記者爲求明瞭該案內幕，昨至思南路看守所擬與在押之文光廷一談，據田立勛所長吿稱：「己於上午八時被地院提去」，遂又趕赴地院，惟地院方面堅稱未提，此事乃愈令人有迷離之感。</p>
<p>據地院院長査良鑑談稱：該案係由新市街警察分局送來，被吿文光廷，金鑫生二人，被控於上年十二月及本年一月十二日，先後在吳淞路寳山路黄興路等處，持刀划奪單身女子財物，又曾竊盜朱巧寳家之洋風爐等物，經曹推事審理後，盜匪部份，因傳被害人無着，遂於一月二十四日諭知被告無罪。至於竊盜部份，不屬特種刑事，依法應由地檢處偵査，故諭知不受理。法警帶出交保，金有保釋放，文無保仍予繼續覊押。因文無人肯保，致會推事對其人之行爲表示懷疑，且因盜匪案由重大，推本雖判決無罪，或許檢察官認爲不當，聲請覆判，故被吿在上訴期間，繼續覊押，於法幷無不合。至於曹推事爲人，決不至出此，是否法警假藉名義敲詐，在未得確實證據以前，亦未能隨便加以斷語。判決書送達稍遲之原因，係由於推事辦理之案件太多。末査院長表示，被吿文光廷如有股實鋪保，隨時可以　　云。</p>

<h3 id="c107">審議小組商討結果　收購剩米暫緩實施 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配會收購市塲食米辦法，巳經市政會議通過，各方反應不佳，認爲足以刺激市價。民食調配會及其他有關機構合組之審議小組，特於昨日下午三時假南京西路七三號開會商討。出席市參議會秘書長項昌權，社會局糧食科長吉明齋等，主席調配會主任委員任顯羣，經交換意見後，認爲收購政策，事關重大，需從長計議，暫緩實施。</p>
<p>據任主委與記者談：就事論事，米在政府手中，總較在商人手中好。收購之理由爲：（一）配售食米工作開始後，在目前之經濟情形下，不能中斷。收購食米即可使配售工作繼續，（二）保持大消費都市之正當來源，俾原來供給上海米糧者，仍能繼續供給。收購政策雖不可能不刺激糧價，但看運用技術，可使刺激减小。其利弊互有，但實爲長久之計。現輿情旣表示反對，爲民服務者，自當順從民意，暫緩實施。靜待各方硏議結果，再決定收購與否。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據民調會發表，上週自十二日至十七日止，計續配撥美國米一二九·〇三五石，連四月份已撥第一二一兩批美米及政府儲備米連同三月滾存米店食米，共已撥發食米四八三·八三一石二斗五升。續收米款三百十萬元者五九·一一五石四斗五升，二百五十萬元者一六·七〇三石零九升，兩共法幣二一三·八八二·六三九·〇〇〇元，連前共收回米款四七八·一五六·七〇二·四六五元正。食油部份，上週發出食油二九四桶（每桶凈重三百六十斤）連別共發出一二·七八九桶，上週共收油款六一·一七〇·五一一·九五〇元。</p>

<p>米市轉趨上漲，晨開繼上日收市之堅勢，加以無錫報價上漲，且民調會可能收購餘米，人心一致轉活，價上漲十萬元。南市場粳薄稻及秈米，糯米一致升十萬元。北市堪挺升更多，粳薄稻及羊秈等均漲十五萬元，特高粳高至四百十五萬元，白元上漲二十萬，爲四百十萬元。民調會售出白米價，最高三百六十五萬。昨日到貨南市塲一千七百九十四石，北市三千二百六十六石。</p>

<p>雜糧大致轉平，黃豆以隔日餅油上漲較多，故挺五萬。苞米回退十五萬二十萬。紅糧平疲，揀靑轉疲二三萬。茶豆南北二帮續納，獨再挺十餘萬。芝蔴當局干涉，以上漲十萬爲限，明平暗堅。生仁亦有當局査問上漲原因，人心大虛，劇瀉近百萬。</p>
<p>食油初市徘徊，終吿回低。晨市貨主仍欲喊高，惟進戶見價過高生畏，趦趄不前，初市雖高，後市轉降五萬元。大統豆油廠開八百八十五萬，收市退爲八百八十萬。生油降十萬元，江北吉桶生油退回至千萬，淸油市上無交易，生菜油八百七十萬，生蔴油挫十萬元，小車蔴油先升後小，結果軋平。豆餅皮球交易較多，昨因外匯之謠未實現，散戶頻吐，終跌三萬元。</p>

<p>華股昨突然反動下瀉，牌價未更，銀根轉緊，物資回低，竟迫使多方一窩風了結，每况愈下，若干種雜股竟吿跌停板。</p>
<p>晨開時人心因國營事業及國庫劵即將問訊而見疲，永紗以二〇九五元登塲，被賣到二〇三〇元，五六號一四號一一六號雖進至二〇五〇元，一七九號等咸賣，代辦費開高至二〇元及二三元，退至一九六五元，經買進至一九九〇元，業外起回風，銀根大緊，再降至一九三〇元。六一號等趁低雖進至一九五〇元，以脫手不已，低價見一八九〇元。華新信誼跌停板，午收爲一九〇五元，除信誼跌停，榮豐跌半成，永紗華新中法信和勤興永公統益景綸火柴麗安中絲商務閘北跌一成，新華國貨跌一成半。</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>一，太湖陰影</p>
<p>帶着三分小恙到無錫，一則爲了久仰太湖景色，未嘗身歷其境；二則爲了想疏散疏散數月來苦悶窒息的心情。</p>
<p>慕太湖之名遠在十年前，記得我的第一個多幕劇本「女傑」，就是取材太湖綠林英雌蔡金花的故事，當時，寫於巴蜀的北溫泉。由於這個劇本，我常常響往太湖的雄偉；壯麗；又由於蔡金花其人，我常常幻想着太湖許多不平凡的豪傑；因此，最近我的電影劇本「綠林好女兒」，仍然是太湖的背景。</p>
<p>我憧憬着，有一天，我也會變成了太湖的好漢！</p>
<p>我是以多麼熱烈的情緒邁上旅程呵，像渴望着投向一個神交已久的愛人底懷抱！</p>
<p>當我跳下火車的時候，我發現這裏的烟雲罩住了太陽，我的心開始迷茫，晦暗起來。</p>
<p>耗費了許多的人力才找到一個下榻之處。每家旅館都掛着「客滿」的牌子，大家都瘋了似的擠向太湖來。</p>
<p>四點多鐘，巳經是濃霧的黄昏了，朋友駕着吉普卡陪我和惠遊梅園。——梅園，這又是我所　念已久的地方，因爲我愛梅。</p>
<p>第一個印象，無錫的城內毫無風景區的特點，牠十足是工業區，牠煩囂；骯髒；街道上沒有一棵樹；一根草。出了城，馬路顚波不平，我的肋骨都快裂開來！田畦間看不見半朶野花</p>
<p>行行復行行，到了梅園，天更陰沉了，同我一般，帶着三分病的樣子。</p>
<p>這裏除了一片梅叢以外，毫無可取。然而梅叢密密，只剩下殘紅瓣瓣，落英成陣，却徒增悽愴蕭索之感！未敢多逗留，邁步林蔭小徑，雨濛濛，恰似流向我心裏的眼淚！穿過石洞，登高峯遠眺，才瞥見湖山春色，正如我夢中的境界。本想飽餐此景，怎奈遍體淋漓，只好匆匆離去。</p>
<p>一宵大雨傾盆，第二天意興闌珊，不願再躭擱，下午就又踏上了歸途。</p>
<p>回到上海，雨過天晴，病也好了，可是太湖只留給了我一個不愉快的陰影。</p>
<p>二，姑蘇艷陽</p>
<p>十四年前的夏天到蘇州寫生作畫；兩年前的秋天再來訪候舊地風景；今年的春天却是三度重遊。人事不同，心情各異！但每次都給了我良好的印象。我曾寫過「小巧玲聽話蘇州」，說明我愛蘇州的悠閒恬靜，我愛蘇州的小巧玲　。</p>
<p>車抵蘇州，逕赴　門外之一家旅社下榻，旅社靜得連貓叫的聲音都沒有。第二天淸晨就被小院的鳥省喚　。這小院種着幾棵桃花，幾株冬靑。起身在小院裏換換空氣，心神爲之一爽。</p>
<p>中午偕惠進城逛玄妙觀，吃了些蘇州特色的點心。然後到獅子林品茗。只是遊客太多，舉目不見山水只見人頭鑽動。不免有些煞風景！於是小坐即去，再到拙政園。</p>
<p>拙政園現在是社會敎育學院的校舍，適逢春假，學生都出去玩了。有幾位朋友在這裏執敎，不願驚動他們，自己隨隨便便地暢遊一週。在這裏，才充分欣賞了艷陽春己，荷池裏已經發了芽，兩岸的楊柳倒垂在水邊上。過曲橋，是一條林蔭幽道，踏着茸茸青苔的石徑，尋覓着夢痕足迹。一排粉垣墻横在眼前，又是一條綠茵茵的山路，路傍成行的桃樹，正開滿着姸紅似火的花，花瓣層次數疊，宛如小朶的玫瑰，毫無「薄命」之感。也有三五棵白海棠參差其間，冲淡了濃郁的春色，顯得滿園的情調更超逸，更美雅。我和惠竟而留連忘返，躑躅於花前日下久之。</p>
<p>至此，惠—一個常住蘇州的人，才承認蘇州確實可愛，她還是第一次發現蘇州有這樣好的地方。</p>
<p>倦遊迄晚，買醉於名酒館元太昌，與同飲者論壺對酌，一時高興，不覺四斤黄湯下肚！於是酩酊爛醉，備極狼狽！回到旅社，通宵嘔吐，連累惠爲我辛苦扶持。翌午醒來，頭重脚輕，猶如大病之後，疲應不堪。臥床竟日，捫心忖思，不勝懊惱，蓋豪氣雖存，而量非昔比矣！</p>
<p>第三天，精神體力恢復健壯，乃又響導惠與東平兄登虎邱，遊西園，進留園。日暖風和，心情亦爲之舒暢曠怡。</p>
<p>虎邱也是人多嘈雜，沒有西園淸靜，西園放生池中魚大，可惜水渾不易見。必須以饅頭引誘始躍出水面。池心建亭，兩端架曲橋，橋頭老楊蒼柳相映成趣。石洞蜿蜓，不似獅子林之雕琢。園外有廟，和尙俗不可耐，爲修五百羅漢金身，借題强紫香資，拒予，即遭辱罵，殊無菩薩胸襟。</p>
<p>留園房屋多被拆毁，墻上到處畫滿了日本兵操練的姿勢，想來淪陷期間曾爲敵人駐軍，勝利之後，地方當局原應稍加修復，其奈官吏之輩只知愛名利，不知愛風景何？致於大好園林荒蕪依然，觸目傷心！</p>
<p>小池僅存臭水，靑萍數點漣漪，顯得一味的悽凉，沮喪。也有小橋；也有石洞；也有假山；只缺少樹木花草。因此，在這裏嗅不到春的氣息，像兩年前，我又徜徉於蕭瑟的秋天裏。</p>
<p>離開留園，春又復活了！我們踏着田野，邁過一塊塊蠶豆的園地，步伐唱和了掠空的鳥鳴，有節奏地走向姑蘇城內。</p>
<p>當夕陽掛住虎邱塔脚的時候，我才別了友人；別了天堂；載着滿身的塵土；滿心的歡愉；滿目的春色；又回到了煩囂的海上。（三七年四月十二日）</p>
<h3 id="c147">美術評介　童星們畫竹 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 朱應鵬</p>
<p>童星門敎授是三十年前的老友，素不知其能畫，直到最近，纔知道擅長畫竹，出於家學，高曾祖父相傳，至意君而四世。</p>
<p>他曾對我談到畫竹之理，覺得竹種之多，竹態之美，實推西南，江南之竹，並無足觀。他的畫竹，多取寫實，所以有竹幹甚長而枝葉稀疏者，乃西南所見；又有於竹上畫鳥巢者，乃緬甸所見。原來緬甸多蛇，鳥爲避蛇，不巢於樹而巢於竹，非親見者不知。他又說到竹葉的上向與下垂，是竹稱的不同，不關晴雨。普通以垂葉爲雨竹，是不確實的。</p>
<p>他又談到山水畫，以爲古人所有山石皴法，如披蔴，劈斧，荷葉之類，全是由眼見的眞景得來。先見山而後有　法，並非先有皴法而後畫山，山石之皴，完全是地質學的關係。所以不應該說某種皴法是屬於某一家的；應該說是屬於地理的。又如山水上各種樹木，亦有地理上的關係。如果以荷葉皴法，來作江南山景，以拳曲的樹木，來點綴西北山景，不免近於玩笑。</p>
<p>藝術不能離開科學，亦猶科學之不能離開藝術一般，我素來抱此見解。今見意君對於畫竹及山水的研究，能把握物理學的地理學的根據，眞是同人中難得的一位。</p>
<h3 id="c148">刃鋒畫展 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 范泉</p>
<p>在文藝界的朋友之中，大家知道刃鋒兄是一位木刻作家，但看了這次展覽會以後，却使我們知道，作者同時也是一位國畫家，而且也是一位西洋畫家。</p>
<p>從這次大新畫廊展覽的作品上看，我們覺得有以下幾種不同凡俗而値得注意的特點：第一，就全部作品的題材上說，作者是採用了社會的下曆物事爲主題。例如木刻中的「爲了生存」，「吿地狀」，「賣兒」，國畫中的「小販」，「鳳陽花鼓」，「縫窮者的母女」，「鞋匠」，一賣藥的夷人」，「流動的鐵工們」，永墨畫中的「羣像」，素描中的「瞎孩子」，「紡工」，「山家」等等。這種藝術的創作傾向，無異開闢了歷來畫家們所沒有走過的新的路徑。這是一種可喜的現象。第二，就作品的構圖上說，作者對於人物的解剖，理解得非常深刻，從而使他以速寫爲基礎而完成的各種構圖，非特有力而明朗，毫無浪費的筆墨，而且創造的人物，看來更是栩栩如生。正由於作者對於人物解剖的理解力的深刻，所以能够使作者完成了第三種特點，那就是：表現手段的多面性。同一種題材，作者可以用木刻的刀，墨水或五彩，以至油畫的筆，恰到好處地表現出來。作者非但致力於「專」，同時還顧到「博」。像這樣的努力和成績，也是爲　一般畫家所不可同日而語的。</p>
<h3 id="c149">池塘 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 綠風</p>
<p>綠萍浮起來了呀，片片的，片片的，很小的面積和體積。若是你遠一點看去，看不到它們圓形的時候：有綠萍的地方便像草地，沒有綠萍的地方便像琉璃。池塘起了幻變了！</p>
<p>晴空和樹枝倒在那上面，而且又擁抱長長的柳條。遊人和嬰孩，成羣的少女們，間或飛來一兩隻小鳥，以及漆得很亮的兒童的手推車，繁多的影子都在池塘裏……</p>
<p>春天的池塘是蘇醒了的池塘。它肥沃得綠油油的，擁有强烈生侖的色素。然而最神妙的是它所搜羅的影子依然保有各自本來的色調，這不同於任何地方的影子！於是有讚美聲，驚嘆聲，小孩的狂叫聲，都落在這春天的池塘裏呵。</p>
<p>委實太美了，看池塘的老人也忘了禁止小孩頑皮的舉動：讓菓皮拋在池塘裏，讓石子拋在池塘裏，讓包糖的紙片揉成飯粒般的紙團拋在池塘裏，讓樹枝和葉子和那長在池塘邊的草都拋在池塘裏……因此你能說他是不盡職守的老人嗎，而對他加以無情的呵責，這顯然是一種錯誤。</p>
<p>眞的，你只能說春天太美了，它美化了池塘，美化了池塘邊的一切。（四，十二，文廟）</p>
<h3 id="c150">一葉航船上的遐想 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>這是一隻放空的回程船，除了底艙堆滿了樟木箱子和南豐橘子之外，乘客和船員不到三十個人。</p>
<p>我所看見的只是能見度很低的嚴冬的天空，不時出現於天際的雁羣，混濁而不安分的江水，高而孤獨的彷彿已經劃破了天空的桅桿，横七豎八的粗粗細細的繩索；我所聽得的只是一聲兩聲汽笛。</p>
<p>堤岸有時近得可以數得出濱岸的寳塔的層數，有時遠得只能隱約地看到一些糢糊的灰色的影子，讓你費盡精神去猜測那裏是樹木？那裏是房屋？那裏是牧塲？有時候更遠了，索興連糢糊的灰色的影子也在若有若無之間了。</p>
<p>假定你是船隻，對方是堤岸，這情形不正像愛情的塲合麽？有時她允許你拉着她的手在偏僻的小徑上散一次步，有時她一看見你總是縐眉，總是說「頭痛得利害」，有時你想得到她一點消息比登天還難千萬倍。所不同的是船隻終究要靠攏堤岸的，而終其一身愛情沒有歸宿的人多如恒河沙數。</p>
<p>我常常在駕駛裏用望遠鏡向兩岸凝視，由於這兩塊玻璃片所起的物理作用，遠的景物變成近的，本來近的就更近了，固然事實上我和堤岸的距離並未因此减少分毫我遇到很多人用錯覺或幻覺來代替自己沒有勇氣承認的事實你找一個環境或一個理由來自我欺騙自我滿足的事實，你可以保存一個業己死在異鄉的親屬底臥房陳設，相信他終有一天會活着回來，儘管你的愛人已經和別人組織了一個相當幸福的家庭，可以相信她還不分晝夜地眷念着你，這些，我都不反對，人要堅持着不自我滿是自我欺騙，那宋免太苦了。</p>
<p>像船上的横七豎八的繩索一樣，我的心裏毫無條理的想到這些事情，我想學習那一支桅桿的冷靜，然而竟抑止不住自己的遐想。</p>

<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>—揚州續夢之二十七</p>
<p>筆者於「茶客」一文中曾說：「俗謂揚人喜愛「早上皮包水，晚止水包皮。「皮包水」是指赴茶社吃茶，「水包皮」則指赴浴堂洗浴」。關於『皮包水』事，己多有道及，現在更一談『水包皮』。</p>
<p>該是便因爲揚人喜愛『晚上水包皮』之故，揚州浴堂，比之別處似乎都要多些。畫舫錄上說：『浴池之風，開於邵伯鎭之郭堂，後徐寗門外之張堂效之，城內張氏復於興敎寺效其製以相競尙，由是四城內外皆然。如開明橋之小蓬萊，太平橋之白玉池，缺口門之螺絲結頂，徐寗鬥之陶堂，廣儲門之白沙泉，埂子上之小山園，北河下之淸纓泉，東關之廣陵濤，各極其盛，而城外則壇巷之顧堂，北門街之新豐泉最著。』這『各極其盛』的若干浴堂名稱，至今也還有保留着的，祗是時移事變，今昔不能相比而已。</p>
<p>先就池子說，畫舫錄上的記載是『幷以白石爲池，方丈餘，間爲大小數格。其大者近鏤水熱爲大池，次者爲中池，小而水不甚熱者爲娃娃池。』這大池，中池以及娃娃池的名稱，在筆者幼年時已不復聽到，祗知是頭池，二池和三池，幷且三池大於二池，二池又大於頭池。該因為娃娃池　是溫水，便於一般澡客，不僅限於娃娃，所以名稱須變，面積也須擴大，而『近鏤水熟』的頭池，不是人人所需，自然在供求的原則下縮小其範圍了。</p>
<p>次就座位說，畫舫錄上的記載是『貯衣之贋，環而列於廳事者爲座廂，在兩旁者爲站廂。內通小室，謂之暖房，茶香酒碧之餘，侍者折枝按摩，備極豪侈。』所謂站廂，筆者幼年還能見到，其顧客，以苦力居多。此外座廂便比較好些，而暖房則更針服了。白沙惺庵居士揚州好百調中所寫：『揚州好：沐浴有跟池。扶掖隨身人作杖，摹挲徧體客忘疲，香茗沁心脾！』也是指一些暖房裏的顧客而言。這類顧客多有固定的『跟池』，每遇洗浴，那固定的『跟池』，會抉掖着入浴出浴，幷且能熟知其顧客的習性，像脚如何燙法，背如何擦法，在池子裏悶的功夫要多大，喜歡不喜歡燙水，都會代爲調排得妥妥帖帖，使顧客舒舒適適，這當然也是『備極豪侈』的事。</p>
<p>更就習俗說，畫舫錄上的記載是『男子親迎前一夕入浴，動費數十金。除夕浴謂之洗蹧蹋，端午謂之百草水。』這『洗臘蹋』和洗『百草水』的習俗，至今小的浴堂還是有的，大而新的浴堂則都不復有此名目。至於親迎前入浴費錢，時至今日，已不再見，可是筆者幼年時却還遇到。因爲親迎者入浴時，總是有人陪伴着，幷且要換上一身新的所謂『裝親褂褲』，訛都會看到和知道，堂倌等等自會趁機討索喜錢，「動費數十金」，便是這樣費去的。此外還有敷事亦爲筆者幼年所親歷而今却已沒有的。在每一浴堂進門時，迎面粉壁上都寫有一個很大的『忍』字。又每一小兒初入浴池時，領帶的大人會帶幾枚『順治』錢投到池裏，後來順治錢難找，便改用銅元。寫『忍』字是何意義，殊令人費解。或謂這是因爲在浴池裏人皆是「袒裼裸裎』，擠擠碰碰，所不能免，如竟動輒生氣，從相罵到相打，池裘水熱，池外永滑，是極易發生危險。因此，於顧客入門時，使其觸目便見『忍』字，藉以提高其警覺性。至於小兒初入浴池，必投銅錢，或者意在討吉利。原來我國人是相信多神論的，以爲無處無神，浴池自也有神司理，雖是賄賂公行，却正是求其保佑哩！</p>

<h3 id="c154">瑪薩里克的心情 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 玄玄</p>
<p>最近在「觀察」上讀到蕭乾的擬　。瑪薩里克遺書，寫得是够「生動」的，如果算它是文藝作品呢，那也就罷了，可是我想作者決不會承認當它是文藝作品來寫作和發表的，作者所要表現的，是代表作者的一種思想，或是立塲，正是借瑪薩里克的嘴，來說自己的話。</p>
<p>蕭乾先生主要地是說，瑪薩里克自信是民主的朋友，自信「新」「舊」兩種民主的社會是可以相安無事的，他不但願見兩種民主的協調，還願童做一種介乎其間的橋樑。可是他畢竟是「不適於離開本土渦久」的，七八年間，他終於還是與捷克「脫了節」，爲了一種糊裏糊塗的解脫，他祗能毁滅他自己。</p>
<p>蕭先生的文章，我說過，是寫得相當「生動」的，但並不眞實。瑪薩里克同然夢想過東西間的協調，但他的夢想畢竟爲現實打破了，夢想打破以後，他不得不想到自己以後的出處問題。在捷克，他是代表捷克與所謂西方世界之間的聯繫的，也便是說，他跟英美的關係是那樣地密切，沒有了他，也便是西方世界的失去了捷克．這一點，在某一部分的捷克人是看得很重要的，在瑪薩里克自己，看得也很重要，但英美那樣的民主國家却並不重視一個孱弱的遠方的友人的那一份嚮往之情，它們只是論斤估價，完全是一副做生意人的面孔，只注重商品的價値，却不講究人與人之間的交情。在流亡的幾年中，瑪薩里克是嘗透了這一種辛酸的滋味的。</p>
<p>他夢想中的和平並沒有到來，不但不曾到來，而且局勢又到了使他非當機立斷的階段，他如果不　捷克這一新興的勢力合作，那祗有再度流亡，而流亡的滋味畢竟是辛酸的：寄人籬下，看人臉色，惟恐自己於人無所用。他是嘗够那種滋味的，因此他不敢再嘗。</p>
<p>在白天思索，晚間失眠的緊張情形下，他接受了捷共政府的外交部長一職，他想：我是當了這麽多年的外長了，如今捷克還是捷克，這一個外交部長，並沒有接受得可恥。</p>
<p>但他總覺得不舒服，不合式，跟他們一班人搞不來，自己也不知道是什麼緣故。其實是他的敎育和社會背景使然，不論你想如何「開明」，總是沒有辦法遷就這宿命似的新環境。於是他思前想後，苦惱着，痛苦着。</p>
<p>如果他對於他的西方友人有着較大的信心的話，他是願意再度流亡的，可是不然，他最懂得一個弱者向强者乞食的難過。再想到自己乘埀老矣，眼底的滄桑也看得够了，他不想再到外國去餐風宿露，受人的頤指氣使了，大槪有了一點年紀的人總不大高興多走動，他要重溫一下童年的好夢，貪戀着這舊時的一切，於是他決定留了下來。</p>
<p>可是他自己也明白自己在這新的環境中是扮着怎樣一個角色。他是高傲的，思索了這許多天，他覺得祗有一死了之，正像名將和美人一樣，不到頭白的時候先下塲，給人一個永遠的好印象。我想瑪薩里克便是在這種心情下自殺的。</p>
<p>如說他的自殺只是解決他自己的心理一的矛盾，那是不對的一，他的自殺是抗議！一抗議不可抗的勢力的製來，也便是表示不合作。在另一方而，他的自殺是警吿，警吿一些僞善的人們，他對於他們並不存着多少希望。因爲他是過來人，希望愈大，失望可能也愈大。</p>
<p>瑪薩里克的死是時代的悲劇，幾乎是宿命的，以瑪氏這樣的思想和地位，處於這環境，殘酷一點地說，死也許是他處置自己最適當的方式。所應該深省和體味的，是自稱是瑪薩里克友人的一羣，他們究竟對於他和他所代表的主張有過多少帮助？帮助的動機是否不堪一問？他的死，一半是你們逼死的！</p>
<p>這也許是比較近似的解釋，我在這麽想。</p>

<p>— 喬齡</p>
<p>金山寺於風和日暖之四月六日突然失愼，精華付之一炬，火由庫房燒起，延及方丈室，藏經樓，玉佛樓，大雄寳殿，知客室等，僅法海洞，觀音閣與七級浮屠依然無恙。因地勢關係，救火隊無法可施，全力僅保住一座山門。惟目前遊客不但並不减少，反而增加，蓋咸欲憑弔此一刧後名勝也。從山門前望去，遊客熙熈攘攘，毫無被焚跡像，進門後則祗見一片瓦礫，幾根枯木，階沿石以脚踏之可碎。四面火牆，搖搖欲倒，令人惴惴。大雄寳殿前香鼎一座，未曾熔去，遊客有撫之嘆息者。另有兩三遊客俯身於大殿壁前，若有所覓，盛傳佛像中有無價之寳藏也。大殿後玉佛樓，玉佛俱碎，瓦亦不全。經樓下枯木横亙，上置火烙水漬之殘餘經典，曝曬於日光中。遊客有謂方丈和尙有師弟某事前曾有警吿，並敎以避劫之法，惜未經採納云云，實屬荒誕無稽。金山失愼係人爲之過，其原因如下：（一）庫房中因儲有大量助燃之石油與煤炭等危險物品，加以通風不良，不須燃點亦能自動着火，糊有科學常識者不難料及。（二）缺乏防火設備：此次失愼係在白天，如有防火設備，一經發覺不難撲滅。（三）樓殿毗連相接，易於延燒。法海洞觀音閣寳塔所以未曾殃及者，皆因離其他建築高遠之故。（四）火起山腰，救火機無從　揮力量。人謀不減，遂令名跡遭刧，可扼腕也。登臨間忽來一僧，披破衲，曳敝屣，揖余而問曰：「金山焚矣，君其奈何？」言時吃吃笑。余訝其無狀，漫應曰：「問佛去！」有識之者吿余曰：「此瘋僧也。」遂攝影數幀，憮然而歸，臨行回首，山門內彌勒佛猶嘻嘻笑於夕陽中。</p>

<p>— 海燕</p>
<p>不管孔丘先生的思想給予後世帝王統治者以多大利用的機會來壓制人民，但孔子本身是無罪而且是有功的，他生長在封建（狹義）時代，而又是封建制度逐漸崩潰的時代，他的主張恰恰適合當時，後世的統治者抹煞了他「聖之時者也」的精神，企圖「行之萬世而皆準」，自有其別有用心處。</p>
<p>但他的「有敎無類」的精神，却無論如何是偉大的思想，學術的跟着他礙固起來固然是阻碍進步的，然而他的敎育精神，一個三千弟子的敎育家的偉大精神，仍然値得我們今天的敎育家效法。但自然，常年洙泗之風，杏壇氣象，決非一袋平價麵粉都買不起，而必須天天論斤稱麵粉吃絲糕如北平最高學府的敎授所能造成。孔子也曾在饑餓當中，可是那是在陳蔡途中，一車兩馬，栖栖皇皇的追求政治理想實施境地的時代，而非杏壇講學時代。如果孔子的敎學精神仍不失爲今天的敎學精神，敎育家們也必需爭取一個安定的不天天在陳在蔡中的環境。倘不然，便是孟子所謂緣木求魚。</p>
<h3 id="c157">愛迪生的癖好 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 國平</p>
<p>愛迪生除掉在實驗室中工作的硏究外，他對於文藝和音樂，是十分愛好的。</p>
<p>他在巴黎時參觀了幾個博物館，他對於古代的藝術作品並不十分認爲至高無上。他曾說：「古代藝術作品之所以著稱於世，所以價値連城，祗是爲了『物希爲貴』的原因。」同時，他對於盧森堡的近代岡畫的作品却很讚賞，他自己家中也收藏了許多圖畫。</p>
<p>愛迪生對於音樂極感興趣，由於他的熱忱和酷愛的心，他發明了留聲機器。愛迪生特別醉心於悲多芬的第九交響曲，他曾請人家灌製這套唱片，每當空閒時，便坐着側耳細聽。愛迪生自己也能奏得一手好風琴和梵啞鈴。</p>
<p>對於維多利亞時期中的作品，愛迪生極滿意朗佛洛和泰尼生兩位詩人。然而愛迪生最崇拜的卻是莎士比亞。愛迪生曾親：「啊，莎士比亞！他有着偉大和深玄的理想！如果他從事於研究科學，他一定是一位超特的大發明家。他似乎認淸了每一件事物的內心。他描摹事物的創作能力是沒有一天會窮盡的。」不過愛迪生以爲莎士比亞的文字太深奧，應該改編爲通俗化的文句。</p>
<p>愛迪生對於大自然的美有深切的愛好。他愛花成癖，每到郊外去散步時，總喜歡帶了一大束各色各樣的花朵回來。他在郊野中常常留戀忘返，他愛那蒼翠的樹木，樊幻的雲霞，和起伏的山巒……。</p>
<p>在這些事物中，愛迪生才體味了生活的意義，人生的眞諦。當他每天早晨起身時，他總懷着愉快的心志來企待着新的一天；當他每天晚上睡覺時，他總覺得一天的工作是有目的地完成了。</p>
<h3 id="c158">「手續」 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 餐霞</p>
<p>凡是「官僚」，都很講究「手續」，「手續」二字，原來也是應該有的，有些地方，確實也是應該要講究的，可是一到了「官僚」們的手裏，就有點不同了。</p>
<p>在貪汚方面說：只要手續做得完全，別人就不容易找到犯罪的證據。在辦公事方面說：手續却變成了卸責推任的工具。</p>
<p>最使人可惡的，是官　們處處講手續，時時講手續，「只要自己手續做到，那怕死人不管！」這一句話已成爲公務員們的口頭禪，於是乎弄得變成了「手續政治」。</p>
<p>我說，手續好像禮節，少不了的地方是應該要的，正像對客人的迎送要行禮一樣。可是這禮節你如果用得太多了，就會使人討厭，明明最敬禮也只消三鞠躬，你却要行六鞠躬九鞠躬。明明送客時只要送到門外行一個禮就够，你却要走一步行一個禮，這豈非太討厭，太可笑！</p>
<p>話還得分開來說，這所謂手續也者，只是官僚們對付別人和牽制別人而講究的，對自己却又會疎忽起來了。譬如我們的副秘書，人家請假逾期了，常會摸出他的假條，指着說：「這傢伙不行，逾了期又不請續假，手續也不做，媽的！」而自己呢？明明只請三天假，倒常會二星期不來。</p>
<p>於此也可想像到所謂「法」者，也只是爲管人而設的，對自己好像就用不着，而且也不需要了，「手續」也者，如此而己！</p>

<p>春秋佳日，海上人士游虞山者，每羣集王四酒家宴飲；車水馬龍，極一時之盛。王四酒家在破山寺山門，民國初年時，僅爲一邨店，主人王四以黄鷄白酒山肴野　供客，頗具眞味，酒尤醇厚。所費不巨，而能得陶然之趣。迨後生意日益鼎盛，翻造高樓三楹，兼備盛宴；外埠人士，趨之若騖，身價日高，寒士不敢問津。民國二十四五年間，易君左來虞，醉後對客揮毫，贈以一絕句，王四酒家之名，乃傳遍江南。聞去歲主席夫人輕車簡從，來此小酌，亦盛稱其肴羞之不惡。今歲店前更闢汽車塲，一日所入，不啻中人之產。其酒菜雖仍以「黄鷄白酒山肴野蔌」相號召，實則山珍海味，叱嗟即辦，食前方丈，其味亦同凡俗矣。眞味終爲流俗所汚，於是亦可覘世變焉。然常熟消費過於生產，工商業俱難有所樹立，幸賴王四酒家曁馬泳齋得吸收外資，今王四己歿，其子恂恂儒雅，任小學教員。</p>

<p>江南諸省市中所屬之小縣城頗多，但城區之小如贛東横峯者，誠爲罕見。横峯縣有淸時爲興安縣，今爲浙贛鐵路所經，其縣治設一山谷中，城內屋只數百家，猶未及他縣之一大鎭。東西不過一里，故當地人有諺曰：「小小横峯縣，三家豆腐店；城裏打屁股，城外聽得見。」</p>

<p>川省又有汽車司機打毁報館之事，據傳是因「嗟夫先生」一文而起，紀事又有「汽車夫」等事，遠道不得其詳，或者游戯之筆，不無輕謔之辭，致反感而演武劇，亦未可知。至於「夫」之一字，原是貴重身分之稱，未有卑下之義。孔子之所以稱「夫子」者。因爲他老先生做過「大夫」，故加一「夫」字，即表尊敬。否則只一「子」字就是。彼時學者身分，雖學生對先生（未仕者）亦只稱某子，不能稱『夫』。戯台上好些丞相自稱「老夫』，其僅止鄉老富翁，如桑園寄子之鄧伯道，捉放曹之呂伯奢，亦只自稱「老漢」，不能稱「老夫」。又如前代封誥，女子自三品以下，只稱淑人，恭人，宜人，安人，孺人，至一品二品方得稱「夫人」。男子一品至五品爲「大夫」，六品以下只稱「郞」矣。禮記曰：「夫者，以知帥人者也。」其字爲「一大」，其義爲「以知識領導旁人」，故可倚仗謂之「丈夫」，光明磊落見義勇爲鋼之「大丈夫」，豪傑之士也。至於轎夫，馬夫，車夫，亦是各司其職，各負其責，前淸及舊代一般人側重官紳，乃將「夫」字硬加立人旁爲「伕」，妄作聰明，不足爲據。</p>
<p>又聞有力主改「夫」爲「駕駛員」者，按「員」乃指數用字，如「幾員大將」「一員官」，一般記載及小說戯劇中常有之。「官員」，「職員」固是官階一流，「會員」「雇員」即是平民風味。民國以來，方戒官僚習氣，改「官」爲「公務員」（此三字合音讀之仍是一「官」字），言其爲公事服務之人員，別於「私務員」而言也。如是則凡爲機關爲遞送公件而開車者，亦可名「公務員」矣，又豈止「駕駛員」而己哉？三十年來，洋車夫，馬車夫等稱，早已流行，從無異詞。惟近年「空航」大興，其司機每稱駕駛而不稱「夫」。或曰，飛機固有發動機，汽車何嘗沒有發動機？司機而飛於空者旣不「夫」矣，司機而駛於陸者又何不「員」乎？以皆有「機」也，是固然矣，然汽車若如飛機之例，則「三輪」自亦可援汽車之例，以其皆爲「車」，雖無機可司，而未嘗不駕而駛之也。於是「兩輪」車又可援三輪之例，因爲三輪二輪，等是一輪」也，都無「機」也。爲公益爲同行道誼計，皆應通盤籌畫，代兩輪設想。若亦稱駕駛員，則係拖拉而行，實在說不上駕駛二字，若任其向隅，不獲與以上三項一律，則有失義氣。現在北方的兩輪車仍不在少數，必須爲斟酌一適當名稱，以彰公道。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Assembly Proposals All Reviewed; Submitted for Discussion at Today's General Meeting; Vice Presidential Candidates Officially Announced <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The National Assembly Presidium held its 24th meeting at 8 PM on the 20th. Chairman Liu Zhi presided and resolved that a general meeting would be held both in the morning and afternoon of the 21st to discuss the review reports of proposals from various groups. Xue Yue and Shen Huilian were designated to serve as chairmen of the morning and afternoon general meetings, respectively.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] In addition to the public announcement of vice-presidential candidates, the National Assembly held group review meetings throughout the 20th. All 858 proposals were reviewed at the highest speed, except for the approximately 150 proposals reviewed on the 16th and 17th. Review opinions were submitted, and it was decided that the general meeting would begin discussing them on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The vice-presidential candidates, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin, were publicly announced at 9 AM on the 20th in front of the National Assembly Hall. The number of signatories supporting each candidate was: Sun Ke, 540; Yu Youren, 512; Li Zongren, 479; Cheng Qian, 338; Mo Dehui, 211; and Xu Chuanlin, 232.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The principle question of establishing a permanent organization after the National Assembly adjourns has been reviewed and passed by the Review Committee and submitted for discussion at the general meeting on the 21st. During the review meeting on the 20th, the name, organization, and responsibilities of the organization were discussed in detail. Among the 20 related proposals, the majority, based on the provisions of Article 7 of the National Assembly Organization Law regarding the establishment of special committees, believed that a body similar in nature to a standing committee should be established during the adjournment to continue its responsibilities. During today's review meeting, many representatives expressed their opinions on this issue. The final review opinion that was passed decided to establish two special committees. The full text of the review opinion is as follows: "After the adjournment of this Assembly, in order to examine constitutional governance and discuss the Constitution in preparation for the discussion and amendment of the Constitution at the extraordinary session, it seems necessary to establish a Constitutional Governance Examination Committee and a Constitutional Research Committee, with the participation of all representatives. Detailed organizational methods should be proposed to the General Assembly by the Presidium for decision." During the discussion, there were concerns that the establishment of this organization would follow the path of the Committee for the Promotion of Constitutional Implementation, achieving nothing and wasting public funds. Therefore, the majority of people expressed the opinion that the composition of the two committees must be prudent, and they must be unpaid positions, doing serious work and serious research, so that the issue of constitutional amendment at the extraordinary session in two years will not be dealt with hastily.</p>
<h3 id="e2">First Review Committee Suggests Adding a Permanent Organization During the National Assembly Adjournment; Approves Proposal for Reforming Politics and Severely Punishing Corruption <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The First Review Committee held a meeting at the Assembly Hall at 9:40 AM on the 20th. 357 representatives attended. Chairman Lin Zigui announced the opening of the meeting and first explained that the review committee should review a total of 163 proposals, which were divided into six categories based on their nature: (1) those related to the National Assembly itself, totaling 24; (2) those related to the Constitution, totaling 10; (3) those related to administration, totaling 59; (4) those related to judicial examinations, totaling 11; (5) those related to local autonomy, totaling 20; (6) others not belonging to the above categories, totaling 39. Because there were too many cases, discussion of each case individually would be impossible. Therefore, the convener's meeting decided to adopt categorized discussion. Afterwards, (1) the conveners explained, (2) the committee members expressed their opinions, (3) the conveners summarized the opinions and submitted them to the General Assembly for discussion. Then, each convener began to explain: Zhang Zhiben explained the proposals related to the constitutional section. Zhang said: Analyzing them, there are five categories totaling ten cases: those related to the next Assembly session, those related to constitutional amendment, those related to temporary provisions, etc. Fu Boping explained the National Assembly and general administrative sections. Those related to the National Assembly were roughly divided into amending the National Assembly Organization Law, amending the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, establishing an organization during the Assembly's adjournment, and the issue of National Assembly representatives' compensation. Among them, the case for establishing an organization was the most numerous, with as many as seven proposed names. Those related to general administration were the principles of reforming politics and the establishment of administrative organizations, etc. Lin Bin explained the local autonomy section, which included several points such as provincial and county autonomy general rules and the rapid completion of local autonomy. Zhong Jiemin explained the judicial examination section, totaling eleven cases, which were relatively simple. Luo Wenmo explained the other cases, totaling thirty-nine cases, which were more complicated because they covered a broad scope and could not be categorized. After each convener finished explaining, they began to speak and express opinions widely. In total, 22 people spoke, most of whom elaborated on the issue of transferring constitutional amendments, and believed that it was necessary to establish an organization after the adjournment. However, among the opinions raised by the speakers, there was no consensus on the name of the organization, and there were different views on the number of members of the committee and whether they should be paid or unpaid positions. For example, Li Hongru stated that forming a Constitutional Review Committee, with the National Government employing the current representatives, would be a paid position. Pan Gongzhan stated that organizing an organization to review and study the Constitution was a factual necessity, and it was also included in Article 7 of the National Assembly Organization Law, which stated that "special review committees may be established when necessary." Therefore, he suggested that the General Assembly establish a special review committee, which could be called the "Constitutional Review Committee," and that the committee should regularly discuss constitutional amendment proposals and submit a concrete report to the Extraordinary General Assembly in the 39th year for discussion. Pan opposed the establishment of a resident committee because it had no basis in the Constitution or the National Assembly Organization Law. Secondly, Pan believed that the number of members should be small and unpaid. Liu Jiashu believed that a constitutional implementation supervision organization should be established, with the National Government inviting all National Assembly representatives to serve. Sun Yafu believed that a permanent organization could be established, but it must have a small number of members, without the need for government employment, and certainly not the large organization of the Committee for the Promotion of Constitutional Implementation. Shi Shangkuan also believed that a special committee could be established, but it must be unpaid. Finally, the Chairman announced that the time was late, and that some of the representatives who had spoken had proposed that the various opinions be handed over to the conveners for collation, to draft a review opinion, and then hand it over to the review committee for discussion, seeking the agreement of the meeting. The Chairman also stated that special attention would be paid to the opinions of the representatives during the drafting, and that issues such as organizational structure would be included. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>The meeting resumed at 3:50 PM. Chairman Fu Boping presented the preliminary review opinions collated by the convener's meeting for discussion. A total of 160 cases had been provisionally drafted with preliminary review opinions, which were presented for discussion one by one. Among them, the most important was the issue of establishing an organization during the adjournment of the General Assembly, which was passed after a relatively long period of discussion. Regarding the "Proposal to Complete Local Autonomy as Soon as Possible," the majority were very active in implementing provincial and county autonomy, and hoped that the various preparations could be completed as soon as possible. The rest of the cases were passed smoothly. Important ones included those related to reforming politics, severely punishing corruption, rectifying officialdom, streamlining redundant agencies, establishing a personnel system, improving the treatment of public school teachers, and ensuring the basic freedoms and rights of the people, all of which were sent to the government for handling or reference. As for the proposals related to determining the next session, amending the Constitution, formulating the Temporary Provisions for Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, and authorizing the President, they were no longer discussed because the General Assembly had already made decisions on them.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The Second Review Committee met on the morning of the 20th, still dividing into four groups to review the 121 proposals related to national defense. The review ended at noon, and the comprehensive review was held in the afternoon. The National Defense Military General Reform Group reviewed 49 cases, all of which were passed and divided into eight categories: (1) summoning retired and transferred military officers to return to service, (2) improving conscription administration, (3) improving the treatment of officers and soldiers and improving the life of the troops, (4) rectifying military discipline and clarifying rewards and punishments, (5) improving military food transportation and supply methods, (6) improving military shortcomings, (7) exempting military service, (8) others. Please refer to the government for reference and consideration. The Strengthening Anti-Rebellion Military Organization Group reviewed 16 cases, all of which were passed and sent to the government for reference, consideration, or earnest handling. The most important one was the proposal to quickly send a large army to stabilize Henan and recover Luoyang as soon as possible. The review opinion was: It is recommended that the government handle it quickly and recover Luoyang within a time limit. The Strengthening Border Defense Group reviewed 18 cases, all of which were also passed. Among them, the six cases regarding strengthening transportation were merged.

<p>[Another Cable] The case of requesting the government to severely punish Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng has been reserved. The case was jointly proposed by He Foqing and 115 others. It was reviewed by the Second Review Committee on the afternoon of the 16th, and the review opinion was decided to be sent to the government for reference. However, among the 35 original proposers, 19 people, including Song Tong, Wu Xietang, Wang Canli, Xu Zhizhong, Hai Jing, and Zhu Jinzhong, recently sent a letter to the General Assembly stating that they had not heard the government's military report before the proposal, so they believed that the military's failure could not be attributed to the Chief of General Staff. Now, listening to the government's report, all military measures were decided by the Supreme Military Conference and handed over to the Chief of General Staff for execution. This responsibility cannot be entirely borne by the Chief of General Staff. The first proposed method in the original proposal is to be reserved. (Note: The first method of the original proposal was "Resolved by the General Assembly, please order the government to remove the Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng from office, and investigate the facts of delaying military opportunities and submit them to military justice for trial." During the comprehensive review by the Third Review Committee on the afternoon of the 20th, the case was submitted and it was decided that the first method would be reserved, and the second method "The General Assembly shall elect representatives to form an investigation team to investigate the senior generals above the division commander who violated military orders and were ineffective in combat, list the facts, and send them to the government for separate punishment, and authorize the Supervisory Yuan to supervise the implementation." was also reserved in conjunction.)</p>

<p>Heated Debate at Fifth Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] The Fifth Review Committee reviewed proposals related to social security on the morning of the 20th. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and Western medicine practitioners had a major dispute over the two cases of revising the Doctors Law and promoting China's inherent medicine, creating the only disturbance in the review meetings of various groups on the morning of the 20th. Among the proposals related to social security, there were 19 cases belonging to the relief business, which were merged into one case: "Please ask the government to earnestly carry out relief business," and its methods have detailed provisions for regular relief and emergency relief. The review opinion was to send it to the General Assembly for reconsideration and transfer it to the government for handling. In addition, cases such as banning opium and drugs, assisting Yongji refugees, helping workers, promoting rural women's health, implementing children's welfare policies, and confiscating the assets of the wealthy and powerful for use in relieving refugees were all passed smoothly and sent to the government for verification. During the discussion of revising the Doctors Law, Hu Dingan, Jiao Yitang, Chen Cunren, and Xu Zinan stood up and spoke. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners advocated reservation, and Western medicine practitioners advocated passage. The two sides disputed, pounding the table with fists and yelling loudly.

The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM, and all proposals have been reviewed.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Seventh Review Committee Passes Proposal to Establish Border Policy: Adapt to Local Conditions to Consolidate National Unity <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Seventh Review Committee held a full-day meeting on the 20th, chaired by convener Bai Chongxi, to continue processing 34 proposals related to the border regions. Among them, more than 10 proposals concerned the development of border education, and it was resolved to send them to the government for reference and implementation, striving to provide convenience for young people of all ethnic groups in the border regions to pursue their studies, and to quickly and effectively supplement their facilities. More than 10 proposals concerned border agencies, local organizations, and the appointment of talents from various ethnic groups. It was resolved to either send them to the government for future reference by the Legislative Yuan, or to request the government to strengthen border institutions and recruit talents from various ethnic groups to strengthen ties and consolidate national unity. In addition, during the afternoon session, after heated discussion and amendment, the committee passed the proposal submitted by Muti Yi, a representative from Xinjiang, "Requesting the government to establish a permanent border policy for ethnic minorities in the border regions, so that ethnic minorities in the border regions can achieve the goal of autonomy." Representatives from Xinjiang and Mongolia and Tibet spoke enthusiastically, criticizing the central government's lack of a permanent border policy for ethnic minorities in the border regions in the past, which led to border officials having nothing to follow, and even violating Sun Yat-sen's policy of ethnic equality, discriminating against border compatriots, and causing unrest. In the future, the key to governing the border regions lies in facing reality, recognizing the natural differences between ethnic groups, and promoting various enlightened policies adapted to local conditions to enhance the centripetal force of border compatriots towards the country and consolidate the unity of the Chinese nation. Finally, after Luo Jialun suggested removing the word "self-determination" from the proposal, it was unanimously passed amidst warm applause. Subsequently, the committee also amended and passed Wu Tiekuer's proposal, resolving to request the government to allow the use of the name "Chinese Turkestan" when local people in Xinjiang use the Uyghur language, but this name does not involve the units of political organizations, so that Uyghur and other Turkic compatriots feel that they can legally and freely use the original name of their homeland in their own language within the motherland, and to prevent ambitious people from using this geographical name to engage in incitement. As for other proposals related to various border constructions, they were also reviewed and sent to the government for attention and reference or retained, respectively. By dusk, all 41 proposals related to the border regions had been processed.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Editorial: Hoping for an Early Convocation of the Peace Conference with Japan <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Review Committee of the National Assembly, held on the 17th, amended and passed the proposal "Requesting the government to determine the principles of the peace treaty with Japan and to convene the peace conference as soon as possible, in order to lay the foundation for world peace and safeguard national rights," and sent it to the government for attention. The full text of the proposal was recorded in this newspaper on the 18th. The content is divided into two parts: one is the preparation for the peace treaty with Japan, that is, the procedural issues of convening the peace conference; the other is the main points of the content and preamble of the treaty, that is, the key points of the treaty clauses. Just as the issue of convening the preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan is mired in division, the government and the people of our country hope to break this deadlock. The passage of this proposal by the National Assembly is sufficient to show the concern of hundreds of millions of people in our country about the Japanese issue, as well as the importance they attach to the content of the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>The issue of convening the peace conference with Japan is the most complex and critical issue in Far Eastern diplomacy at the current stage. In the past six months, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have been arguing over procedural issues, with divergent opinions and dangerous situations, and have reached a stalemate. Judging from the current indications, the United States and the Soviet Union have well-thought-out plans and their own intentions. Only our China is in the most unfavorable situation in the pincer attack of the two poles. In recent months, the United States has been actively supporting Japan and has not hesitated to change the plan of the Far Eastern Commission to control Japan in order to counter the stalemate of the peace conference. The United States seems to no longer need to convene the peace conference with Japan. If this stalemate is not urgently sought to be broken, the US policy of supporting Japan will continue to develop, and the result will inevitably lead to the division of the Allied countries, and even expand the crisis in the Far East. We Chinese do not want to see the division of the Allied countries, and even more do not want to see the flames of war in the Far East again. Therefore, our position is to hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will coordinate on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, and complete the signing of the treaty as soon as possible. The proposal passed by the National Assembly represents the strength of this call. We hope that the authorities, and also appeal to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, to use their wisdom, broaden their horizons, seek compromise, and quickly convene the peace conference with Japan, so as to avoid the growth of the Far East crisis. The voice of the Chinese people is a sincere and loud voice. The principles passed by the National Assembly in this proposal are the minimum requirements and should be responded to in any case.</p>
<p>Regarding the procedure of the peace conference with Japan, the proposal passed by the National Assembly has two principles, which are practical and reasonable. First, regarding the voting method, the four powers should fully retain the right of veto; second, regarding the location of the conference, it should be convened within Chinese territory. These two principles are roughly the same as the content of the Soviet Union's reply to our country's note on November 28 last year. The Soviet Union agreed with our country's suggestion on November 17, stating that the decision on the peace treaty with Japan must be agreed upon by the representatives of the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain. However, it emphasized that before the preparatory meeting of the peace conference, the four powers should hold a meeting of foreign ministers in China to discuss the preparations for the peace conference with Japan. The difference between the Chinese and Soviet statements is that China advocates that the Far Eastern Commission be responsible for drafting the peace treaty, and the four powers retain the right of veto; while the Soviet Union advocates that member states other than the four powers participate in the work of various committees and subcommittees that may be established by the peace conference, and the drafting of the peace treaty be the responsibility of the four foreign ministers' meetings. Because the United States and Britain opposed the Chinese and Soviet proposals, the convening of the preparatory meeting for the peace conference was mired in a stalemate. This time, the suggestion of our National Assembly does not involve the relationship of the Far Eastern Commission. Is it closer to the Soviet Union's opinion, hoping to use the principle of Chinese-Soviet unity to exchange for the unity of the four countries, and to seek to break the stalemate in the preparatory stage of the peace conference, which remains to be studied by the diplomatic authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding the content of the peace treaty with Japan, the proposal passed by the National Assembly is divided into eight categories: political, economic, military, territorial, compensation, ideological, control, and supervision of implementation. It is a complete outline of the peace treaty. Looking closely at the various principles, it takes the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration as its spirit, and thoroughly eliminating Japan's economic armament and ideological armament as its main goal, in order to achieve the establishment of a peaceful and democratic Japan. It is very ideal. Except for a few principles that need to be discussed, most of them are propositions that meet the requirements of the people of our country. For example, in the political aspect, to establish a peaceful and democratic political system, it is necessary to abolish the Emperor system; in the economic aspect, to thoroughly eliminate the potential of military industry, it is necessary to expand compensation. As for the retention of the industrial level, whether it is correct to set it at the level of 1928-30, it needs to be studied by experts. In terms of territory, the claim is limited to Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Hokkaido, which is relatively harsh. Because the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations stipulate that Japan's "adjacent small islands" in the mainland, under the principle of not including Okinawa, should all belong to Japan. This is an issue related to the survival and growth of the Japanese people, and it is necessary to study it carefully; militarily, attention should be paid to eliminating the existence of armed potential, and ideologically, attention should be paid to preventing the revival of militaristic thought, and these should be combined with strict control. These are all set up to thoroughly eliminate Japan's economic armament and ideological armament. As for the time of control, this proposal advocates 50 years of control, which seems excessive. The purpose of controlling Japan is to supervise the effective implementation of the treaty clauses, and it does not require 50 years. In the past, some people advocated 25 to 30 years to supervise Japan's compliance with the peace treaty, which is more reasonable.</p>
<p>In short, the various principles of the proposal passed by the National Assembly are generally correct. It is the requirement of the people of our country, and it is a more organized proposition, which deserves the attention of both China and foreign countries. Now, the issue of convening the peace conference with Japan has become a stalemate due to the divergence of opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union. If this stalemate continues to develop, the future of the Far East will be unimaginable. Our country hopes to break this stalemate. People in both the government and the opposition hold the same hope. After the National Assembly passed this proposal, it was sent to the government for attention and adoption. We hope that the diplomatic authorities will make further efforts to break the deadlock in the peace conference with Japan. At the same time, we also hope that Allied politicians will cherish the calls of the people of our country and take responsibility for rebuilding peace in the Far East, break the current stalemate, and convene the peace conference with Japan as soon as possible!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Tang Jusheng, a representative of the trade group of our country's delegation to Japan, issued a statement this afternoon after visiting MacArthur, head of the Economics and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, for the second time, saying that the Sino-Japanese trade deadlock would be broken soon and could be restarted. According to Tang, MacArthur had agreed to our government's decision to separate the accounts of various private merchants from the 10 billion yuan of legal tender owed by the Central Trust Bureau. The Allied Headquarters hoped that this debt would be cleared by the Central Trust Bureau. MacArthur had frankly overturned the suggestion made by the Central Trust Bureau to allocate the debt as part of Japan's compensation to China. MacArthur agreed that Sino-Japanese private trade would adopt a barter system due to China's shortage of foreign exchange, and allowed the issuance of entry permits to another twelve Chinese businessmen so that they could understand the trade situation between China and Japan. Tang continued to say that the Allied Headquarters will soon compile a table of the debts owed by the Central Trust Bureau, and he himself will study the method of repaying this debt. This debt is the main reason why Sino-Japanese trade has almost fallen into a deadlock.</p>
<h3 id="e32">An Authoritative Figure in the Education Community Talks About the Irrationality of the Public Funding System: Believes that Most of the Education Funds Should Be Used for Basic Education <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Recently, some students in colleges and universities have requested the government to provide full public funding, and even engaged in hunger strikes and parades. According to an authoritative figure in the education community who spoke to reporters, there is no precedent in the world for providing all food expenses to students in colleges and universities. Most young people who are determined to study use the income from their own labor to pay for their education expenses. In various countries, there are many great people who have achieved success through part-time work and study. This was also the case in our country before the War of Resistance. Moreover, the implementation of the public funding system has resulted in student food expenses and public funding accounting for a shocking figure in the entire education expenditure item. According to recent statistics, the public funding for students in public and private colleges and universities across the country in April alone required 286 billion yuan (including public-funded students in provincial private colleges and universities), while the regular expenses and temporary expenses for colleges and universities in the same month were only 79.1 billion yuan, and the living allowance for employees was 405.5 billion yuan, totaling 484.6 billion yuan, which is a ratio of 1.6 to 1 compared with student public funding, that is, student public funding accounts for more than 35% of the cost of higher education.</p>
<p>When President Chiang and the presidents of various national universities recently had a dinner, he said that education funding would be increased again. I (the person in authority claimed) believe that in the future, education funding should be used to the greatest extent on basic education and on eliminating illiteracy, because it is not only unreasonable but also unfair for a citizen whose children have received basic education to pay taxes to provide food for a college student. When the country enters the constitutional stage, if there is financial strength, it should do its best to promote national education, which is the proper and reasonable way.</p>

<h3 id="e50">National Assembly Chronicle; Vice Presidential Election Heats Up <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Special] On the majestic and beautiful wall above the entrance of the National Assembly Hall, where the presidential candidates were announced four days ago, the announcement of the vice-presidential candidates was replaced on the 20th. The style and wording of the announcement are generally the same. The only difference is that the list of vice-presidential candidates includes six people: Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Fulin. Only two people ran for president, which, in colloquial terms, was a foregone conclusion. Yesterday's election results have confirmed this. Six people are competing for the vice-presidency, but there is only one position. Only one of these six can be elected. On whose head will this luck fall? The election will be held on the 23rd, and the results will be announced after noon on the 23rd. There is no doubt that the competition will heat up in the days leading up to the election.</p>
<p>In fact, the vice-presidential campaign began as early as a month ago. It went from publicity to actual activity after the opening of the conference. Especially as the election date approached, the activity became more intense. Among these six candidates, as the order progresses, the more active were the first names, and the least active were the last names. Vice Chairman Sun hosted the National Assembly representatives in batches, giving a different speech at each reception. Dean Yu, Director Li, and Director Cheng hosted them later, but they were also held one by one. Only Committee Member Mo hosted the latest. Committee Member Xu's campaign, as he himself said, "To avoid a lot of trouble, it is better to participate in the campaign myself." So his activities are minimal, almost non-existent. In addition to banquets, there were also broadcasts, speeches, visits, and interviews, etc. Vice Chairman Sun and Dean Yu's propaganda offensives were the most intense. The huge oil portraits on both sides of the National Assembly Hall attracted the most attention from the representatives and citizens. On the morning of the 20th, Dean Yu's propaganda car also appeared on the streets. In addition to the huge油画 oil painting portrait, there was also amplified broadcasting, which attracted many citizens to watch. Newspaper publicity was also clearly divided into camps, and people's attitudes toward them were obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>When the nomination signing method was announced, the first round of close combat began in the venue. The signature book required the representatives to sign their names. Eating, entertaining, watching movies, and giving墨寳 ink treasures seemed to offset the effect. Signing required on-the-spot persuasion. Some units used the average distribution method, allocating a certain number of representatives to each person to sign. Some representatives used the method of accepting everyone, signing for everyone, regardless of whether it was valid. At that time, the people who were actively signing were full of秋喜 joy, but by midnight on the 19th, it gave the presidium a headache. When Gu Yuxiu and other twelve chairmen were responsible for checking the signatures on the nomination forms, they found 884 duplicate names. The representatives who used the "accept everyone" method had signed on three, four, or even six nomination forms. The nomination form of Sun Ke had the most invalid names, with 250 people, and Xu Fulin also had 18 invalid names. This was still the statistics at 2:00 AM on the 20th. The presidium still had 50 letters that had not been opened at this time. These letters all contained statements about the signing. A representative wrote in a letter to Hong Lanyou: "I originally signed Vice Chairman Sun, but for the sake of politeness, I had to sign Dean Yu. Please Hong take the signature of Vice Chairman Sun as the standard when reviewing the list." From this, we can see the熟烈 intensity of the competition in the first round.</p>
<p>When the candidate nominations were announced, the identities of these six candidates were confirmed. The fierce competition will unfold in the next three days. Voting is different from signing. According to the single-name method during the election, each representative can only choose one person, unless they intend to invalidate the ballot. The choice of each representative will be made at the moment when they pick up the ballot and pick up the pen. Except for the truly mass, truly supporters, there will be no doubt when choosing, the choices of other free representatives will determine the future destiny of these six.</p>
<p>It is impossible to predict the election results now, but the number of signatures can be used as a reference. According to the provisions of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the vice-presidential election procedure is the same as the presidential election procedure: "The candidate who receives more than half of the total number of votes of the representatives is elected. If no one receives the prescribed majority of votes, the top three candidates with the most votes will be revoted, selecting one candidate. If no one is elected, a third vote will be held, selecting one candidate. If no one is still elected, the top two candidates with the most votes in the third vote will be revoted, selecting one candidate, and the one with the most votes will be elected." Many people estimate that because the vice-presidential election has six candidates, excluding one or two with relatively weak strengths, most of the others are equal, it will not be as simple as the presidential election and may require four votes.</p>
<p>What will be the fate of the candidates? What will be the choices of the representatives? We still have to look at the efforts in the three days before the election. (April 20th, Nanjing)</p>

The press release also pointed out that the British and French governments believe that once the hostilities have ended, the wartime agreement should be terminated and normal peacetime relations should be restored.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons on the 19th that Britain will demand compensation from the Soviet Union for the loss of a British Viking transport plane that collided with a Soviet Yak fighter plane over Berlin on April 5, destroying the British plane and killing all 14 people on board. One member suggested that if the Soviet Union interferes with British aircraft again, the British side should not hesitate to deploy jet-propelled fighter planes to escort them. Bevin replied that he believed that the Soviet Union would be more rational and that there would not be any further threats in any way. Bevin also said that copies of the investigation report of the plane crash court of inquiry have been sent to the British, American, and French military commanders in Berlin.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The American China Policy Association accused Wallace on the 19th of influencing US policy toward China with his secret report made in 1944. Colbert, chairman of the association's committee, has written to President Truman requesting the release of the report. At that time, Wallace was Vice President. After traveling to Siberia and China in the summer of 1944, he submitted the report to the late President Roosevelt. Colbert said at a press conference that the suggestions in Wallace's report were implemented at that time and continue to this day, leading to the victory of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, London, 19th] According to the Daily Telegraph's foreign correspondent, a conservative newspaper, officialdom here is giving great importance to the increasing communist activities in the various colonies. The author claims that the Communist Information Bureau is intensifying its movements to incite riots and sabotage the economies of the colonial territories of Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands by means of slowdowns. According to news from the Southeast Asian areas that are under the greatest threat, it is believed that the Far East Communist Information Bureau, under the leadership of Communist Party elements in China, will soon be established. Malaya is the place where communist infiltration is deepest. They use the Malayan People's United Front as a cover. The United Front is mostly controlled by Communist Party members and has established contact with Communist Parties in Burma, Australia and other places in the Far East.</p>

<h3 id="e65">US Secretly Tests Atomic Bomb on Eniwetok Island to Gain a Broader Understanding of its Military Effectiveness <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The US Atomic Energy Commission has issued a brief statement announcing that the United States has conducted a test of new atomic weapons on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean, with excellent results. The statement also said that the date of the test could not be announced for security reasons. The test was conducted in accordance with the safety restrictions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. Other information about the test will not be released publicly for the time being.</p>
<p>The Atomic Energy Commission's statement then reviewed the developments prior to the test, saying that since last December, construction of a new atomic weapons test site has begun on Eniwetok Island. A mobile unit composed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force completed the construction of the test site in the late winter of 1947. Large-scale equipment has been installed there for use by scientific and technical teams. The main purpose of the test site is to provide scientific and engineering protection for improved designs. The scientific and technical tests at the test site can provide new basic information and a broader understanding of the principles of nuclear fission for peaceful use and the military effectiveness of atomic energy. Officials of the Atomic Energy Commission have refused to disclose any details about the test. Scientists believe that the new weapon tested has made further progress in the principle of nuclear fission compared to the atomic bomb, and has completed amazing progress in the development of atomic energy. The most common speculation in recent weeks has been that the United States will conduct a deep-water atomic bomb test, the main goal of which is to test the resistance of submarines to atomic weapons. According to what is known to the outside world, there have been a total of five atomic bombs detonated before this. The first was tested in the desert of New Mexico on July 16, 1945, the second was dropped on Hiroshima, the third was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, and two were dropped during atomic bomb tests on Bikini Island in June and July 1946. It is still unknown whether the one tested this time on Eniwetok was an atomic bomb or another form of weapon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Scientist Albert Einstein now supports Third Party candidate Wallace for president. The party believes that the United States already has sufficient military superiority and should not have other ambitions, so whether Einstein is still willing to work to improve the atomic bomb is questionable. Scientists believe that it is possible to increase the power of existing atomic bombs or to manufacture new types of atomic bombs that are hundreds or thousands of times stronger, but this is not expected to be realized at present. The government had previously announced that the efficiency of atomic bombs had been greatly increased, referring only to the production process and not to their efficiency. Some people believe that this is just an ordinary experiment and that there are no new types of weapons involved. The results of this experiment prove the necessity of cooperation between special units of the Army and Navy. The existence of this special unit has been kept secret until now. After the completion of this test, other tests will continue to be held. The Atomic Energy Commission has issued a warning that the Eniwetok area will be a dangerous area forever in 1948. President Truman ordered the extension of the term of office of the Atomic Energy Commission's instructors, and his intention is very clear. He wants to keep the secrets of atomic development and ensure that this knowledge is only obtained by a very small number of people.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 20th] The 55-nation Freedom of Information Conference unanimously passed three resolutions in cheers on the 19th: eliminating war, fascist or Nazi propaganda; banning false or distorted news; and prohibiting the dissemination of propaganda promoting racial or national hatred. Indian representative Mukherjee earnestly urged the governments of the participating countries to avoid actions that could cause war debates in newspapers and radio stations. When referring to the so-called term "war mongers," he expressed doubts about its true definition. He believes that news reporters who point out war crises are not necessarily war mongers. To prevent war-mongering behavior, it is necessary to pay attention to the true causes of war-mongering behavior. The reason lies in the uneven distribution of national power, so the strong feel the temptation to use pressure, while the weak feel the temptation to succumb. Succumbing to these temptations is enough to cause incidents, which eventually lead to war-mongering behavior. Mr. Mukherjee also believes that the best way to guarantee freedom of information is to promote a sense of discipline in newspapers and to establish tribunals to enforce these disciplines to encourage them.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Geneva, 19th] The World Freedom of Information Conference, which opened here on March 23, is expected to conclude its work tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Deputy Director and Union Representatives Go to Nanjing <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, railway workers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines went on strike to protest the cancellation of rice subsidies. Starting at 12 noon, more than 1,500 workers from the Railway Bureau's machinery and works departments went on strike and gathered at the North Railway Station, sitting and lying on the tracks to prevent trains from departing. Deputy Director Xie of the Bureau immediately convened an emergency meeting with worker representatives. Around 4 PM, the workers accepted the persuasion of Chief Wang Zhaohuai of the police department and others, and left the tracks. The first train, the "Jinling" express, departed at 4 PM under the armed protection of more than a hundred police officers, and traffic on the two lines resumed after a four-hour interruption. Director Chen Bozhuang of the Bureau had departed a few days ago to inspect stations in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang. Yesterday, after receiving the news by telephone in Nanjing, he immediately met with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation to request instructions on the issue of compensation. Railway union representative Pan Bingsheng, Deputy Director Xie Zhen, Personnel Director Sun Dangyue, and Police Chief Wang Zhaohuai took the night train to Nanjing to report the situation to Director Chen in person.</p>
<p>The compensation of Railway Bureau employees has been calculated based on the public education personnel index, plus a 30% business allowance and a rice subsidy of eight dou (eight dou for staff and technicians, six dou for ordinary workers, and four dou for apprentices and waiters). The housing subsidy is uniformly two dou and five sheng of rice. Starting in April, the index increased to 240,000 times, and the Ministry of Transportation ordered that all housing and rice subsidies be canceled. After learning of this news, railway workers repeatedly gathered to discuss countermeasures. Fearing that this regulation would be too stimulating for the workers, the Bureau temporarily did not make it public, which made the workers' emotions even more unstable. Yesterday was the Bureau's payday (payday was originally scheduled for the 10th and 20th of each month, but it was customary to pay one or two days earlier). Anxious to understand the situation, the workers from the machinery and works departments held a meeting at the Wuzhen Road Bridge Workers' Club at 8:30 AM. The Bureau also received the news at this time, and Deputy Director Xie immediately convened a meeting of senior Bureau officials to discuss countermeasures and telegraphed Director Chen in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Marched to the Station and Blocked Trains from Entering and Leaving</p>
<p>At 12 noon, the workers marched to the North Railway Station, demanding that the rice subsidy be maintained, and blocked various trains from leaving and arriving at the station, creating a very serious situation. Driver Wang Apei attempted to drive train number 25 himself, but was dragged down and beaten by the workers. Union director Zhou Lansheng was injured by a stone while trying to persuade the workers to leave. A temporary curfew was imposed at the North Station, and all trains arriving in Shanghai were stopped at Zhenru and the West Station, with passengers transported by trucks dispatched by the Bureau. Railway Bureau Deputy Director Xie Zhen, Chief of General Affairs Wang Yunsun, Deputy Chief Chen Fenke, Personnel Director Sun Dangyue, Police Chief Wang Zhaohuai, Chief of the Road News Section Peng Fenggang, Commissioner Zhang Yunhe, and union representatives Yuan Qiaofu, Wang Cheng, Pan Bingxin, Shi Zhi'an, Lin Changgen, and Zhou Lansheng held an emergency meeting and decided to first persuade the workers to resume work, express sympathy for their demands for rice and housing subsidies, and be willing to be responsible for striving for them with the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>Persuade Workers to Resume Work, Guarantee Negotiations on Compensation</p>
<p>The twelve people went to the end of platform six at the North Station to persuade the workers to resume work, guaranteeing that they would be responsible for negotiating the compensation issue. Chief Wang Zhaohuai further emphasized the importance of transportation during the suppression of the rebellion, and warned them to be careful to prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to infiltrate and disrupt. The workers also deeply understood the importance of their own duties, so they agreed to resume work first and wait for a reply by 12 noon today. The traffic on the two lines, which had been deadlocked for four hours, was finally restored. Yesterday, the delayed trains included train number 25, which was delayed by three hours and eight minutes, train number 2 ("Jinling"), which was delayed by two and a half hours, train number 74, which was delayed by two hours and two minutes, train number 1 ("Qiantang"), which was delayed by two hours and twenty-five minutes, train number 41, which was delayed by one hour and twenty-five minutes, train number 58, which was delayed by two hours and twenty minutes, and train number 43, which was delayed by forty minutes. Train number 1 ("Jinling") arrived two hours and ten minutes late, train number 5 arrived one hour and five minutes late, and train number 77 arrived one hour and twenty minutes late. The remaining trains number 84, 82, 80, 51, 44, and 7 were also delayed.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Pan Gongzhan Claims Ignorance <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 20th] Mr. Pan Gongzhan told reporters on the 20th regarding the Shanghai Infant Welfare Association that he believes infant welfare should be managed by the public sector, as private management may not achieve the best results due to manpower and financial resources. Therefore, the Infant Welfare Association agreed with Mayor Wu last winter to change it to a municipal institution, to be taken over by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The board of directors of the association was dissolved, and his title as chairman of the board no longer exists. He has not interfered in whether the association will continue to operate after being taken over by the Bureau of Social Affairs. When the Bureau of Social Affairs took over the association, it promised to repay part of the debt. Recently, President Tan Boqin came to Nanjing and said that the debt has not been fully paid. He will write to Director Wu Kaixian to request payment. He recently received a reply from Wu, stating that the debt has been fully paid. Now President Yun intends to reclaim the association for self-management. He knows nothing about this matter and has not written to Director Wu to request the return of the association's buildings.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to information from the Bureau of Social Affairs, the details about the closure of the Infant Welfare Association published in various newspapers and attributed to Tan Boqin are largely inconsistent with the facts. Since its establishment, the association has not been registered in accordance with the law. Last September, according to Tan Boqin's report, due to financial difficulties, it was impossible to continue operating, and he requested the Bureau to take over and repay the debts. The Bureau considered the difficulties stated to be factual and approved its closure. The Bureau has since repaid the association's debts to the bank and paid severance fees to the employees. After the closure of the association, the vacant buildings were occupied. It was not until January of this year that the Bureau was able to take over after several negotiations. After consulting with the Bureau of Health, it was determined that the buildings were too small to operate a childcare facility. According to Tan Boqin, the original main building of the association was privately leased and could not be transferred, so the branch building was allocated to the Shanghai Workers' Welfare Association. There was no approval for municipalization in the original case.</p>

<p>The factory currently has more than 300 regular workers and more than 400 temporary workers. The highest output is 4,500 barrels per day. Recently, new equipment was purchased from the United States, shipped to China, and installed, increasing daily production by 3,000 barrels. The factory now has four giant furnaces, but unfortunately, due to insufficient power, they cannot be fully operational. When reporters visited the site, they saw that some of the production equipment was idle.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Suggest that China Textile Corporation Distribute Cloth at Par Prices <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Daily Necessities Rationing Review Subcommittee of the Cost of Living Index Compilation Research Association held a meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, chaired by Director Gu Bingyuan, to discuss the specific rationing plan. As a result, it was considered that there were too many technical difficulties in the proposed rationing of the eight items of daily necessities: soy sauce, cigarettes, firewood, salt, soap, toilet paper, matches, and socks. The weight in the cost of living index is very small. If it is necessary to do so, it is feared that the gains will not outweigh the losses, so it was decided to postpone it temporarily. Cotton cloth has the highest proportion, accounting for one-third of the total of nine daily necessities. However, private textile factories are unable to supply cloth due to a lack of raw materials, so it was decided to recommend that the government organize par price distribution through the China Textile Construction Corporation. According to Director Gu, the total percentage of the nine daily necessities in the index is only 18%, and even if all of them are rationed, the impact on the index will be very small. According to the calculation method of the index, each month requires four boxes of matches, 33 jin of firewood, one chi of plain cloth, four chi of colored cloth, half a pair of socks, fifteen packs of cigarettes, four and a half pieces of soap, 1.33 dao of toilet paper, six jin of soy sauce, and four and a half jin of salt. If calculated based on 600,000 workers in the city (400,000 industrial workers and 200,000 vocational workers), the total capital required would be 625.6 billion yuan, averaging about 1.04 million yuan per worker. If the allocated items are not suitable, it would not be very practical. For the benefit of the workers and the practical difficulties of rationing, it was decided to abandon the original intention of rationing daily necessities.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Applications for Compensation Machinery Exceed Three Times the Number Available <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to relevant sources, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has received more than 1,000 pieces of working machinery as compensation from Japan, but the number of applications from private factories is at least three times that number. Therefore, the review work in the future will be extremely tedious and may not be completed within the next month. As for the review criteria, on the one hand, the performance and history of the applicant factory will be considered to determine whether it has the ability to use the compensation materials. At the same time, it will also be considered whether it has sufficient financial resources to pay on time according to the contract. Currently, all civilian materials arriving in Shanghai are still stored in the China Merchants Bureau's No. 7 Wharf warehouse. Among the working machinery, the large ones weigh up to eight or nine tons, and the average is about four tons. In the future, the price of reselling to private factories will be calculated in US dollars, but nothing is known here about the work of the valuation committee.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yang Jingzhou, manager and technician of the Hollywood Candy Factory at No. 35, Lane 345, Daxi Road, Shanghai West, was introduced by the China United Property Insurance Company last month to go to Taiwan to inspect the No. 61 Sugar Factory managed by the Xinghe Enterprise Company. On the 3rd of this month, he was accompanied by a staff member of the company on the Zhongxing wheel to Taiwan. On the 9th, a telegram was received from Keelung stating that he would take a boat back to Shanghai on the 10th. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, Hollywood Factory suddenly received a telegram from the Shanghai Minsheng Company stating that the company's Minzhong wheel, which came to Shanghai from Heqi, had a passenger named Yang Jingzhou who had gone missing en route, leaving behind a handbag. After Hollywood Factory sent staff to investigate the passengers who returned to Shanghai in the same cabin at the time, Wu Heming (resident at No. 12, Ningbo East Road) and Wu Changsheng (resident at No. 16, Lane 183, Laodagu Road), it was proven that when Yang boarded the ship, several people were seen preventing him from leaving Taiwan and snatching his ticket. The two sides argued for a long time. After the ship departed, Yang had talked to them, but suddenly went missing after 2 AM the next morning. The factory has now sent staff to Taiwan to investigate this bizarre disappearance case, and reported it to the Port Investigation and Guard Team and the Police Bureau to investigate the truth. According to the person in charge of the Hollywood Factory yesterday, Yang is a Shanghainese, 47 years old, graduated from St. John's University in his early years, and has unique insights into the manufacture of chocolate candy. Guanshengyuan hired him as a consultant. He used to be a technician at the foreign firm Sullivan Factory for four years, and was once sent to Japan by the factory to inspect the manufacture of chocolate candy. After returning to China, he studied carefully and strived for perfection. The internal billet materials of Chinese candy factories that imitate chocolate candy are mostly purchased from him. Therefore, after hearing the news, the factory urgently sent a special commissioner to take a plane to Taiwan to investigate the truth, and is expected to return to Shanghai today. In his abandoned handbag were a diary, a New Testament Bible, and several letters. One letter to a friend in his factory said, "I am in his ring, there is no way to think..." and a note inserted in the Bible read, "Father! Father! Is there salvation? Life and death are great numbers." The diary only recorded events up to the 9th. The above-mentioned documents have now been handed over to a lawyer for safekeeping. It is said that Yang has simple luggage, which is still in the Taiwan No. 61 Factory.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Acquittal but Continued Detention, Wen Guangting Files Complaint with City Council, Detention Center Says He Was Taken to District Court, District Court Says He Was Not Taken, Cha Liangjian Says He Can Be Released at Any Time <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wen Guangting, a technician at the Hu Xinghua Foundry at No. 314 Qipu Road in this city, was previously transferred to the local court for investigation and trial by the Xinshi Street Police Station on charges of banditry and theft. After Judge Cao Zuwei tried the case, he pronounced Wen Guangting not guilty on January 24, and the remaining parts were not accepted. He ordered bail in court, and the bailiff Xu Jingkuan took him to the He Xing Foundry at No. 594 Kunming Road to find bail. According to the bailiff's report, the factory refused to provide bail, so Judge Cao ordered continued detention.</p>
<p>Recently, Wen Guangting, in the Sinan Road Detention Center, filed a complaint with the Human Rights Protection Committee of the City Council, accusing Cao Baosheng, a volunteer police officer of the Xinshi Street Police Station, and plainclothes police officers of the station of malicious framing and forced confessions, and Judge Cao Zuwei and bailiff Xu Jingkuan of colluding to solicit bribes.</p>
<p>In order to understand the inside story of the case, the reporter went to the Sinan Road Detention Center yesterday to talk to Wen Guangting, who was in custody. According to Director Tian Lixun, "He was taken to the district court at 8 AM this morning." So he rushed to the district court, but the district court firmly stated that he had not been taken. This matter is even more confusing.</p>
<p>According to Cha Liangjian, the president of the district court, the case was sent by the Xinshi Street Police Station. The defendants, Wen Guangting and Jin Xinsheng, were accused of using knives to rob single women of their property in Wusong Road, Baoshan Road, and Huangxing Road in December last year and January 12 this year, and of stealing a foreign-style stove from Zhu Qiaobao's home. After Judge Cao tried the case, the banditry part was dismissed because the victims could not be found. As for the theft part, it did not belong to special criminal cases and should be investigated by the district prosecutor's office according to law, so it was ordered not to be accepted. The bailiff took him out for bail. Jin was released on bail, but Wen was continued to be detained without bail. Because no one was willing to bail Wen, the judge expressed suspicion about his behavior. Moreover, because the banditry case was serious, even though the judge ruled him not guilty, the prosecutor might consider it inappropriate and apply for a retrial. Therefore, the defendant continued to be detained during the appeal period, which is not illegal. As for Judge Cao's character, he would never do this. Whether the bailiff used his name to extort money, he could not make a casual judgment before obtaining definite evidence. The reason for the late delivery of the judgment was that the judge was handling too many cases. Finally, President Cha said that if the defendant Wen Guangting had a substantial guarantor, he could be released at any time.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The civil part of the Yan Peixing case is actively undergoing mediation with the help of powerful people. The lawyers of both parties formally negotiated at the Yu Shun Law Firm yesterday, but it is reported that no agreement has been reached. Yan's condition is to recover the lost items from the factory, of which 40 boxes of hardware materials were recovered a few days ago from the home of Hong in No. 31, Sipailou, Nanshi. He is forcing the woman to hand over the remaining ten boxes. The woman's condition is that Yan Peixing give Yuan Baoying 5 billion yuan and break off relations from then on. Because there is a wide gap between the opinions of both parties, the negotiations have not reached a result. However, even if the civil part of the case is settled, the police bureau has transferred all the files of the criminal part to the district prosecutor's office for investigation. Whether it can also be settled with the civil part will depend on how the district prosecutor's office proceeds.</p>

Tang was detained for investigation. Tang confessed that he had temporarily embezzled more than 10 million yuan of business taxes last year due to heavy expenses and a large family. Later, due to meager income, he could not make up for it. He personally wrote a confession, admitting that he had mistakenly stepped into the legal net due to temporary confusion and requested leniency. After the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, the prosecutor briefly questioned him. Due to conclusive evidence, he was ordered to be detained.</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessel "Hai Zhou," which arrived yesterday from Kaohsiung with a large shipment of sugar, arrived at the port around 12:00 noon. When turning around in the Bailianjing River area to dock at Yangjiadu Wharf, it went against the current. Near Yangjiadu Wharf, there was a sailboat that, due to unfavorable wind conditions, was maneuvering and sailing. Initially heading from west to east, the "Hai Zhou" steered to the left to avoid it. In a moment, the sailboat turned again and headed from east to west. Upon seeing this, the "Hai Zhou" quickly steered to the right to avoid it, but unexpectedly the wharf was very close. The ship's hull collided with the wharf, with great force, destroying three pontoon piers, one floating bridge, and one mooring dolphin. Fortunately, the ship's hull was not damaged. After berthing the vessel, the captain reported the details of the incident to the Shipping Affairs Section. Furthermore, the company's vessel "Hai Huang," returning to Shanghai from Huludao, ran aground in Tongsha on the 16th of this month. The "Guoqiang" vessel was dispatched to tow it to safety, and details were reported in previous newspapers. According to reliable news from the company yesterday, the "Hai Huang" vessel floated on its own and was out of danger during high tide at 8:30 AM yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e116">Three Japanese War Criminals Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Three Japanese war criminals were executed by firing squad yesterday by the military tribunal: (1) Kari Satoru, former chief of the Chinese Section of the Special High Police of the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters in Vietnam and Deputy Captain of the Hanoi Gendarmerie Platoon, with the rank of captain. His crime was that in 1945 he arrested overseas Chinese Pan Yongchang and Wu Zhisheng and inflicted cruel torture on them. Wu Zhisheng died as a result. (2) Tajima Nobuo, former sergeant major of the Special High Police of the Da Nang Gendarmerie Platoon in Vietnam, and (3) Konishi Shin Saburo, a sergeant. These two criminals arrested overseas Chinese Xu Wenmao and Li Zhongxun on April 5, 1943, and tortured them to death. The above three criminals were sentenced to death by the Guangzhou Headquarters Military Tribunal after the victory, and the sentences had been approved by the Ministry of National Defense. As the original trial court had been closed, they were transferred to Shanghai for execution. Yesterday at noon, Wang Jiamei, Chief Prosecutor of the Military Tribunal, interpreter Wang Renming, and clerk Wang Chenghua, led armed military police to the Tilanqiao Prison to bring forth the three criminals and inform them that they were ordered to be executed. The three criminals were very calm. Each wrote a will and asked to smoke cigarettes. In his will, Kari Satoru even extravagantly talked about "hoping to realize Sino-Japanese cooperation." The three criminals were then escorted to the execution ground by military police and each was killed with one shot.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Valuation of China Merchants Bureau Assets; Total Value Exceeds US$200 Million; Two Ministries to Form a Joint Committee for Official Valuation <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The nationalized China Merchants Bureau's sale to private enterprise has been decided in principle. The sale would be half of its total assets. Last week, the bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Communications to first evaluate all its assets and equipment itself and submit this information to the ministry for reference. As for the official valuation, it will be officially determined by a valuation committee jointly formed by the Ministries of Communications and Finance, which will come to Shanghai to conduct an on-site investigation. According to internal estimates of the China Merchants Bureau, the total value of the bureau's assets is over US$200 million, with ships and real estate accounting for the largest part. If half of its assets are sold as shares, the amount will also be over US$100 million. According to related sources, whether the sale will be smooth is still difficult to predict at present. Due to the unstable situation, the shipping industry's freight transport has been greatly affected, and income has sharply decreased. Therefore, it is uncertain whether private shipping companies have the financial capacity to purchase, and whether those with financial resources are willing to invest in the shipping industry is also a problem.</p>

While they were negotiating prices, Wu suddenly asked Chen about the check and said that Shanghai has many pickpockets and he should be careful to keep it safe. He added it would be safer to leave it to him to look after. Chen then handed the check to Wu, who took the opportunity to escape without a trace. More than an hour later, Chen realized he had been deceived and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, who sent officers to the Xie Mao Shen money exchange to stop payment. They found that the check had already been paid to the Yi Feng Money Exchange. The next morning, the handling officer and Chen waited at the Yi Feng Money Exchange. At 10:00 AM, Wu actually came to cash the check and was immediately arrested. After interrogation at the station, he confessed to the fraud and was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office to be prosecuted for fraud.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Review Group Discusses; Postponement of Surplus Rice Purchase <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The measure for the Food Distribution Committee to purchase rice on the market has been passed by the Municipal Council, but the response from all parties has been negative, believing that it will stimulate market prices. The review group, jointly formed by the Food Distribution Committee and other relevant institutions, held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon at No. 73 Nanjing West Road to discuss the matter. Xiang Changquan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and others attended. Chairman Ren Xianqun of the Distribution Committee presided over the meeting. After exchanging opinions, it was believed that the purchase policy was a major matter and needed to be considered at length, and its implementation was postponed.</p>
<p>According to Chairman Ren's conversation with reporters: Speaking objectively, it is better for rice to be in the hands of the government than in the hands of merchants. The reasons for the purchase are: (1) After the work of allocating and selling rice begins, it cannot be interrupted under the current economic situation. Purchasing rice can allow the allocation work to continue. (2) Maintaining a proper source for large consumption cities so that those who originally supplied rice to Shanghai can continue to supply it. Although the purchase policy cannot help but stimulate grain prices, it is possible to reduce the stimulation by using technical skills. There are advantages and disadvantages, but it is a long-term plan. Now that public opinion has expressed opposition, those who serve the people should follow public opinion and postpone the implementation. We will wait for the results of discussions from all parties before deciding whether to purchase or not.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the Food Distribution Committee, from the 12th to the 17th of last week, a total of 129,035 piculs of American rice were allocated. Including the first and second batches of American rice allocated in April and the government's reserve rice, along with the rice in rice stores carried over from March, a total of 483,831 piculs and 2.5 dou of rice have been allocated. A total of 59,115 piculs and 4.5 dou of rice were collected at 3.1 million yuan, and 16,703 piculs and 0.9 dou of rice were collected at 2.5 million yuan, totaling 213,882,639,000 yuan in legal tender. The total amount of rice collected so far is 478,156,702,465 yuan. In terms of edible oil, 294 barrels of edible oil (each barrel weighing 360 catties net) were issued last week, bringing the total number of barrels issued to 12,789. A total of 61,170,511,950 yuan in oil payments were collected last week.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Rice Market Sentiment Turns Firm; Japonica and Indica Rice Rise Together; Premium Japonica Rises to 4.15 Million Yuan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The rice market turned upward. The opening price in the morning continued the firm momentum of the closing price on the previous day. In addition, Wuxi quoted a higher price, and the Food Distribution Committee may purchase the remaining rice, so the public sentiment unanimously turned active, and the price rose by 100,000 yuan. Japonica paddy and Indica rice and glutinous rice in the South Market all rose by 100,000 yuan. The North Market was even more firm, with Japonica paddy and Japonica Indica, etc., all rising by 150,000 yuan. Premium Japonica rose to 4.15 million yuan, and Baiyuan rose by 200,000 yuan to 4.1 million yuan. The Food Distribution Committee sold white rice at a maximum price of 3.65 million yuan. Yesterday's arrivals were 1,794 piculs in the South Market and 3,266 piculs in the North Market.</p>
<p>Flour has been quiet for a long time and is thinking of moving. Yesterday, because the demand from the North gangs was stronger, the holders were very firm in raising prices. Bingchuan flour opened at 1.42 million yuan. Midway, the North gangs bought in a lot, and it rose all the way to 1.45 million yuan. At the close, floating goods were released, and it fell back to 1.43 million yuan, a rise of 20,000 yuan. Lao Che closed at 1.435 million yuan, up 35,000 yuan. Hong Feng and Jiancheng each gained 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The trading of miscellaneous brands turned active. Bran was similar to the previous day, and flour mills raised the bid price by 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains generally turned flat. Because bean cake oil rose more the day before, soybeans rose by 50,000 yuan. Corn fell back by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Red sorghum was flat and weak, and selected green sorghum turned weak by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Tea beans continued to be accepted by the north and south gangs, and they rose by another 100,000+ yuan alone. The authorities intervened in sesame, limiting the increase to 100,000 yuan, ostensibly flat but secretly firm. The authorities also inquired about the reasons for the rise in raw peanuts, and the public sentiment was very uncertain, resulting in a sharp decline of nearly 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The edible oil market hovered in the early market and eventually reported a decline. In the morning market, the holders still wanted to call for higher prices, but the entrants were afraid of the high prices and hesitated to move forward. Although the early market was high, the later market turned down by 50,000 yuan. Datong Soybean Oil Factory opened at 8.85 million yuan and closed at 8.8 million yuan. Raw oil fell by 100,000 yuan, and Jiangbei Ji Barrel Raw Oil fell back to 10 million yuan. There was no trading on the clear oil market. Rapeseed oil was 8.7 million yuan, and raw sesame oil fell by 100,000 yuan. The small vehicle sesame oil rose first and then fell slightly, resulting in a breakeven. There were more trades in soybean cake futures. Yesterday, because the rumors of foreign exchange did not materialize, retail investors frequently released, and finally fell by 30,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessel "Hai Zhou" transported a large batch of sugar from Kaohsiung, totaling 8,100 tons, or 85,840 bags. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and berthed at Yangjiadu, Pudong, for unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Taiwan Sugar Initially Tight, Then Soft <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially tight and then soft, with ups and downs ranging from 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. As the New Taiwan dollar and allocation prices increased at the same time, the market had already heard the news and risen first. Yesterday, the market rose again, and actual sales inevitably stalled, so the later market unanimously turned small.</p>
<p>Spot No. 24 coarse white was initially 5.85 million yuan, then fell back to 6.8 million yuan, a slight increase of 80,000 yuan from the previous day. No. 45 white was 6.5 million to 6.4 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan. Straw bags were 6.4 million to 6.35 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan. No. 20 medium-grain white was 5.5 million to 5.4 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan. Taiwan red was 5.25 million to 5.15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Native sugar was more stable. Shantou green opened at 3.5 million yuan for 300 to 400 bags. Xinghua white was short of high-quality goods, and it rose another 400,000 yuan, opening at 5.8 million yuan. Xinghua red was 3.55 million yuan, up another 150,000 yuan, with several hundred pieces traded. Diao green rose by more than 100,000 yuan, finally at 2.95 million yuan. Hainan red was 2.9 million to 2.95 million yuan, with limited transactions.</p>

<p>Chinese stocks suddenly moved in reverse and fell sharply yesterday. The listed prices did not change, the money supply tightened, and the prices of goods fell, forcing multiple parties to close positions en masse. Several miscellaneous stocks fell to the limit.</p>
<p>The morning opening was weak because people were concerned about the upcoming inquiry into state-owned enterprises and treasury bonds. Yongsha opened at 2,095 yuan and was sold to 2,030 yuan. Although Nos. 56, 14, and 116 advanced to 2,050 yuan, Nos. 179, etc. were sold. The agency fee opened high at 20 yuan and 23 yuan, and fell back to 1,965 yuan. After buying in to 1,990 yuan, the market rebounded outside the industry. The money supply tightened greatly, and it fell again to 1,930 yuan. Although No. 61, etc. took advantage of the low price to advance to 1,950 yuan, the selling continued and the low price reached 1,890 yuan. Huaxin and Xinyi fell to the limit. The noon closing was 1,905 yuan. Except for Xinyi, which fell to the limit, Rongfeng fell by half a percent. Yongsha, Huaxin, Zhongfa, Xinyi, Xinhe, Qinxing, Yonggong, Tongyi, Jinglun, Huochai, Lian, Zhongsi, Shangwu, and Zhabei fell by 10 percent. Xinhua Guohuo fell by 15 percent.</p>
<p>The market was slightly stable in the afternoon. Yongsha opened at 1,950 yuan and was sold to 1,920 yuan. Nos. 119, etc. all advanced. Trading was once stagnant. The national banks did not intervene much, and it once rebounded to a high price of 1,975 yuan. The closing price fell back to 1,942 yuan. Huaxin reported another fall to the limit. Compared with the morning closing price, Huaxin fell to the limit, Hengfeng shrank by a little over 10 percent, Rongfeng fell slightly, Lian and Yonggong were still flat, and the rest rose slightly. Various unlisted stocks in the off-market market all reported slight declines.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Government Bonds Stable; Foreign Stocks Weak <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds were stable yesterday. Series C opened at 111,000, and fell from 113,000 to close at 105,000. About 4 million yuan was traded. Compared with the previous closing price, Series A and B were still flat, Series C and E were lower by 2 yuan, and Series D fell by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were forced by tight money to sell actively yesterday. There was no shortage of rebounds outside the circle, which was extremely unfavorable midway. However, with the help of Hong Kong Electric Power and news, it was slightly stable in the end. Jardine Matheson opened at 2.85 million in the morning, rising to 2.87 million, and fell back to 2.74 million. In the end, it was slightly firm, struggling around 2.8 million. As a result, Steel Corporation fell by 10 percent compared with the previous closing price. Jardine Matheson, Jardine Matheson Spinning and Weaving, and Paper Edition each fell by a little less than half a percent, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Foreign Tea Traders Firm <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign tea market, exporters continued to inquire about 1947 Pingshui pearl tea, but the holders' minds were still optimistic and they were reluctant to part with it. As a result of the discussions between the two parties, there was no progress, and transactions remained narrow, but the potential remained firm. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, since the real needs of the Tianjin gangs have turned sluggish, the market is currently only relying on the dissipation of goods in this street and in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, so the market is still not lonely. In terms of prices, this year's new goods have become softened in the presence of more arrivals and active supply. However, various old teas are consistently firm and energetic due to the depletion of stocks.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Local Business Conditions <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou [Our Newspaper Guangzhou 20th] The rising trend in the financial market here has stabilized slightly. The Hong Kong dollar hovers around 133, and gold is 4,530. However, rice prices continue to rise unabated. The public is panicking. The Provincial Field Grain Office is currently selling stored grain in succession to stabilize grain prices.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Our Newspaper Hangzhou 20th] The Hangzhou silk market is rising wildly, and transactions are frequent. Prices are called out without any standards. Factory silk rose sharply to 390 million, dried cocoons closed at 300 million, and artificial silk showed firm intention to rise sharply. Rice, with production areas still firm, has risen more than it has fallen in the Hangzhou market, with machine-milled rice reporting 370,000.</p>
<p>Wuxi [Our Newspaper Wuxi 20th] The actual sales of goods here are sluggish and have seen a decline. However, grain prices have risen suddenly and soared straight up. White Japonica opened at 4.404 million, Baiyuan was 3.944 million, Yang Indica was 3.804 million, Pu Indica was 3.814 million, Waijiang Indica was 3.774 million, Xinghua Indica was 3.824 million, Japonica rice was 1.863 million, Yang Indica rice was 1.717 million, Yuan rice was 1.845 million, wheat was 3.6 million, white wheat was 3.75 million, Bingchuan flour was 1.416 million, and soybean oil was 8.56 million.

<p>Yesterday, in the yarn market, rumors of a rise in foreign exchange rates had been circulating for days, but this did not materialize yesterday, causing sentiment to turn negative. Furthermore, tangible sales were thin and sparse, and the local market was also weak. The market experienced a comprehensive decline yesterday. At the opening, all grades started low, with 42-count Blue Phoenix immediately breaking the 240 million mark. Subsequently, due to retail investors releasing their holdings and those with short positions taking the opportunity to sell, market prices entered a sluggish trajectory, once falling to 234 million. Near closing, there was a slight rebound, ultimately closing at 245 million, a drop of 5 million compared to the previous day. The trend for 21-count Double Horse became increasingly unsustainable, opening at 157 million in the morning and falling to 151 million, a sharp drop of 13 million. Other grades all experienced general declines ranging from 3.5 million to 7 million.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth advanced rapidly and retreated sharply yesterday. New longs from the previous day competed to sell, with industry insiders selling successively due to unbearable interest burdens. Buyers held back, and retail investors took the opportunity to sell short. Each cloth was down more than 200,000 yuan from its peak, while cloth from private factories tended to stabilize. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached as high as 5.17 million yuan, ultimately closing at 4.94 million, and finally at 4.91 million yuan. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company offered 37 types of cotton cloth and 2 types of bedsheets for sale. Blue Chicken fine cloth was priced at 4.53 million yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Piji at 4.62 million yuan, with few applicants.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday (the 20th), the Textile Construction Company, as usual, opened sales of cotton cloth, totaling 37 types, and 3 types of bedsheets. Applicants were extremely enthusiastic, with a total of 609 applications. 28,860 bolts of cotton cloth and 320 bedsheets were sold. Except for 10 factory applications, purchasing 2,480 bolts of cloth, all were purchased by cloth merchants.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to rise. Supply from traders was scarce, and the market's inventory was depleted. Bids were repeatedly raised, with all grades rising by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, as cotton yarn advanced rapidly and retreated sharply, sentiment softened slightly. The Flower Management Committee took this opportunity to raise purchase prices along with the market. Cargo owners sold at the highs, and trading became more active, with about 1,000 bales changing hands. The prices for delivery to the public treasury were: Chongming flower at 19 million, Hankou fine velvet at 22 million, and Jingyang at 24.7 million, with 700 bales traded. The factory price for fire machine was 18.5 million, with 300 bales traded. Zhoupu cottonseed was priced at 4.67 million.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Rayon Declines; Factory Silk Firm, but High <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The rayon market declined yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand, etc., with luster, opened in the morning and immediately fell to 239 million yuan. Trading was very thin, and fluctuations were slight. The noon close fell further to 236 million yuan. The afternoon continued to be weak, and the closing price was 235 million yuan for the selling price.</p>
<p>The factory silk market initially showed firmness yesterday, but soon declined, ultimately being slightly weaker than the previous day. High Zero Load opened at 380 million yuan at the highest in the morning, and 60 million yuan at the lowest in the afternoon. There were no transactions for each grade of five-load goods. Various factories were unwilling to sell because loan measures had not yet been decided. Dry warp stocks were very depleted, and the price of silk in the countryside was very high, so the asking price for High Zero Load reached 320 million yuan in the morning, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>The silk market rose and then fell yesterday. Huaqiang real silk quilt covers rose to 156 million yuan at the opening in the morning, reaching a maximum of 157 million yuan. Later, it was heard that the stock market was frequently falling, raw materials were declining, and sentiment gradually weakened. The closing price fell to 149 million yuan. Dacheng checkered Biji was priced at 540,000 yuan. The afternoon market continued to be weak.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Tea Merchants Provide Opinions on This Year's Tea Loan Business <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Tea is one of China's important exports. The government's tea loan business for this year has already had a detailed plan drafted by the Farmers Bank of China, which will be approved at the board meeting to be held tomorrow (the 22nd) at the Four Banks Joint Office. According to the consolidated opinions of the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association of China Tea Association, the First and Second District Tea Making Association, and the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association: (1) The total cost of production funds for export tea this year is estimated to be 10% self-funded by tea merchants and 90% government-loaned. (2) Regarding the government loan portion, please consider the actual needs and make appropriate changes to the 36th year's method. That is, the tea loan for this year should be changed to be issued in four phases, and distributed according to the total cost ratio as follows: 1. The first phase loans 40% for the purchase of raw tea (combined with the tea merchant's self-funded 10% for a total of 50%). 2. The second phase loans 20% for processing. 3. The third phase loans 10% for transportation. 4. The fourth phase loans 20% for mortgage (that is, handled according to 90% of the total cost). (3) The mortgage loan period is set at three months. If the market is stagnant or the export price cannot meet the requirements, it can be extended by two months.

<p>A Reader Reports Being Cheated</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: I am a department store merchant, with a shop on North Henan Road. At around 2:00 PM on April 16th, a person wearing a dark-colored coat, an old-fashioned western suit, a duckbill hat, and pockmarks on his face came to my store to purchase goods in bulk, totaling 11 million yuan. The person placed a bundle of cash, totaling 10 million yuan, on the counter. My apprentice Xing Xue checked the cash and found no shortage. I said to the person that the price of the goods was 11 million yuan, and paying 10 million yuan now was too far off, and the transaction could not be completed. The person then bundled up the cash and put it in a bag. However, as he approached the door, he turned back and entered, saying that he would reduce the purchase of Panda men's socks by three dozen, so that the deal could be done. I thought there was still a small profit of 100,000 yuan to be made in this kind of business, so I agreed. Who knew that later it was discovered that the cash he had paid had already been switched, the outer packaging was the same, but the inside was all small notes of 50 yuan and 100 yuan, so I lost money. This kind of swindler has clever methods and is very easy to fool. I hope you will allow me to disclose this, so that all industries will be wary, so that the treacherous schemes will not succeed. Sincerely, Huang Mianqian</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>One, The Shadow of Tai Lake</p>
<p>Bearing a slight illness, I went to Wuxi, partly because I had long admired the scenery of Tai Lake but had never experienced it personally; partly because I wanted to alleviate the depression that had been suffocating me for months.</p>
<p>My admiration for Tai Lake dates back more than ten years. I remember that my first multi-act play, "Heroine," was based on the story of Cai Jinhua, a female outlaw hero of Tai Lake. At that time, I wrote it in Beibei Hot Springs in Sichuan. Because of this play, I often yearned for the magnificence and splendor of Tai Lake; and because of Cai Jinhua, I often fantasized about the many extraordinary heroes of Tai Lake. Therefore, my recent film script "Good Daughter of the Green Forest" still has Tai Lake as its backdrop.</p>
<p>I dreamed that one day, I would also become a hero of Tai Lake!</p>
<p>With what fervent emotions I embarked on the journey, as if longing to throw myself into the embrace of a lover I had long known in spirit!</p>
<p>When I jumped off the train, I found that the smoke and clouds here covered the sun, and my heart began to feel lost and gloomy.</p>
<p>It took a lot of effort to find a place to stay. Every hotel had a "Full" sign, and everyone was flocking to Tai Lake as if they were crazy.</p>
<p>At just past four o'clock, it was already a foggy dusk. A friend drove a jeep to accompany me and Hui to visit Meiyuan Park. — Meiyuan Park, this is another place I have long missed, because I love plum blossoms.</p>
<p>My first impression was that the city of Wuxi had none of the characteristics of a scenic area. It was purely an industrial area, noisy and dirty; there was not a single tree or blade of grass on the streets. Once out of the city, the road was bumpy and uneven, and my ribs almost cracked! I couldn't see half a wildflower in the fields.</p>
<p>Walking and walking, when we arrived at Meiyuan Park, the sky became even gloomier, just like me, carrying a bit of illness.</p>
<p>Apart from a grove of plum trees, there was nothing worthwhile here. However, the plum trees were densely packed, and only a few remaining red petals were left, with fallen petals forming a阵, only adding to the desolate feeling! I dared not linger, and stepped onto the shady path. The rain was misty, like tears flowing into my heart! Passing through a stone cave, climbing to a high peak for a distant view, I only caught a glimpse of the spring scenery of the lake and mountains, just like the realm in my dream. I wanted to feast on this scene, but I was soaked to the bone, so I had to leave in a hurry.</p>
<p>A torrential rain poured down all night. The next day, I was in low spirits and unwilling to linger any longer, so I embarked on the return journey in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Back in Shanghai, the rain had cleared and the sky was clear, and my illness had also improved, but Tai Lake only left me with an unpleasant shadow.</p>
<p>Two, The Bright Sun of Gusu</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, I went to Suzhou in the summer to sketch and paint; two years ago, I came again in the autumn to visit the old scenic spots; this spring is my third visit. The people are different, and the mood is different! But each time it gave me a good impression. I once wrote "Small and Exquisite Suzhou," explaining my love for Suzhou's leisure and tranquility, and my love for Suzhou's smallness and exquisiteness.</p>
<p>The car arrived in Suzhou, and went straight to a hotel outside the 葑門 to stay. The hotel was so quiet that even the sound of a cat meowing could not be heard. The next morning, I was awakened by the birds singing in the small courtyard. This small courtyard had several peach trees and several holly bushes. I got up and changed the air in the small courtyard, and my mind was refreshed.</p>
<p>At noon, Hui and I went into the city to visit Xuanmiao Temple and ate some Suzhou-style snacks. Then we went to Lion Grove Garden to enjoy tea. However, there were too many tourists, and all I could see was the movement of people's heads instead of mountains and rivers. It was a bit of a nuisance! So we left after a short sit and went to Humble Administrator's Garden.</p>
<p>Humble Administrator's Garden is now the campus of the Social Education College. It happened to be spring break, and the students were all out playing. Several friends were teaching here, but I didn't want to disturb them, so I casually strolled around for a week. Here, I fully appreciated the beauty of the bright spring. The lotus pond had already sprouted, and the willows on both sides hung upside down on the water. Crossing the winding bridge, there was a shady path. Stepping on the mossy stone path, I searched for traces of dreams. A row of pink walls lay in front of me, and then another green mountain road. The rows of peach trees beside the road were full of bright red flowers, with multiple layers of petals, like small roses, without any feeling of "ill fate." There were also three or five crabapple trees interspersed among them, diluting the rich spring colors, making the mood of the whole garden more detached and beautiful. Hui and I lingered and forgot to return, hesitating in front of the flowers for a long time.</p>
<p>At this point, Hui—a person who often lived in Suzhou—finally admitted that Suzhou was indeed lovely, and she had discovered such a good place in Suzhou for the first time.</p>
<p>Tired of traveling until late at night, I bought drunk at the famous liquor store Yuantai Chang, and discussed the壶 while drinking with my companions. I was so happy for a while that I unknowingly drank four catties of yellow soup! So I was drunk and extremely embarrassed! Back at the hotel, I vomited all night, which made Hui work hard to support me. When I woke up the next afternoon, my head was heavy and my feet were light, as if after a serious illness, and I was extremely tired. I lay in bed all day, reflecting on myself, and I was very annoyed, because although the heroic spirit remained, my capacity was not what it used to be!</p>
<p>On the third day, my spirit and physical strength recovered, so I led Hui and Brother Dongping to climb Tiger Hill, visit Xiyuan Temple, and enter Lingering Garden. The sun was warm and the wind was gentle, and my mood was also relaxed and happy.</p>
<p>Tiger Hill was also crowded and noisy. Xiyuan Temple was not as quiet. The fish in the Xiyuan Temple's liberation pond were large, but unfortunately the water was turbid and difficult to see. You have to use steamed buns to lure them out of the water. A pavilion was built in the center of the pool, with curved bridges on both ends. The old willows at the bridgehead were interesting. The stone caves were winding, unlike the carvings in Lion Grove Garden. There was a temple outside the garden, and the monks were unbearably vulgar. They used the excuse of repairing the golden bodies of the five hundred Arhats to extort donations, and when refused, they were scolded, which was completely devoid of the compassion of a Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>Many of the buildings in Lingering Garden were demolished, and the walls were covered with drawings of Japanese soldiers practicing. It seems that it was used as a garrison by the enemy during the occupation. After the victory, the local authorities should have repaired it slightly, but the officials only knew how to love fame and wealth and did not know how to love the scenery. As a result, the beautiful garden remained barren and desolate, which was heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Only a small pond of smelly water remained, with a few duckweeds rippling, showing a sense of bleakness and depression. There were also small bridges; there were also stone caves; there were also rockeries; only trees and flowers were missing. Therefore, I could not smell the breath of spring here, just like two years ago, when I wandered in the bleak autumn.</p>
<p>Leaving Lingering Garden, spring was revived! We stepped on the fields, crossed one piece of broad bean garden after another, and our steps echoed the chirping of the birds in the sky, rhythmically walking towards the city of Suzhou.</p>
<p>When the setting sun hung on the foot of the Tiger Hill Pagoda, I said goodbye to my friends; said goodbye to paradise; carrying a body full of dust; a heart full of joy; and eyes full of spring colors; and returned to the noisy sea. (April 12, 1937)</p>
<h3 id="e163">Art Review Child Stars Paint Bamboo <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>Professor Tongxingmen is an old friend of thirty years ago. I didn't know he could paint until recently, when I learned that he was good at painting bamboo, which was passed down from his family. From his great-great-grandfather, his family has engaged in the art for four generations.</p>
<p>He once talked to me about the principles of painting bamboo, and felt that the variety of bamboo and the beauty of bamboo postures were best found in the southwest. The bamboo in the south of the Yangtze River was not worth mentioning. His bamboo paintings mostly take realism, so there are some with very long bamboo trunks and sparse branches and leaves, which is what he saw in the southwest; and some with bird nests painted on bamboo, which is what he saw in Burma. It turns out that there are many snakes in Burma. To avoid snakes, birds do not nest in trees but in bamboo, which those who have not seen it personally do not know. He also talked about the upward and downward direction of bamboo leaves, which is due to the different names of bamboo and has nothing to do with sunny or rainy weather. It is not accurate to commonly regard drooping leaves as rainy bamboo.</p>
<p>He also talked about landscape paintings, believing that all the ancient mountain stone wrinkle methods, such as hemp fiber, axe splitting, and lotus leaves, all came from the real scenes seen with the eyes. First see the mountain and then have the wrinkle method, not first have the wrinkle method and then paint the mountain. The wrinkles of mountain rocks are entirely related to geology. Therefore, it should not be said that a certain wrinkle method belongs to a certain family; it should be said that it belongs to geography. Similarly, the various trees in landscape paintings also have geographical relationships. If you use the lotus leaf wrinkle method to create the scenery of the south of the Yangtze River, or use tortuous trees to embellish the scenery of the northwest, it is inevitably close to a joke.</p>
<p>Art cannot be separated from science, just as science cannot be separated from art. I have always held this view. Now I see that Yijun's research on painting bamboo and landscapes can grasp the physical and geographical basis, and he is truly a rare person among his peers.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Renfeng's Painting Exhibition <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Quan</p>
<p>Among friends in the art world, everyone knows that Renfeng is a woodcut artist, but after seeing this exhibition, we know that the author is also a Chinese painter and a Western painter.</p>
<p>Looking at the works exhibited at the Daxin Gallery this time, we feel that there are several unusual and noteworthy features: First, in terms of the subject matter of all the works, the author uses the things of the lower strata of society as the theme. For example, "For Survival," "Suing the Landlord," and "Selling a Child" in woodcuts, "Vendors," "Fengyang Flower Drum," "Mother and Daughter Sewing for the Poor," "Shoemaker," "Itinerant Medicine Seller" in Chinese paintings, "Group Portrait" in Yongmo paintings, and "Blind Child," "Spinster," and "Mountain Family" in sketches, and so on. This artistic creation tendency is no different from opening up a new path that painters in the past have not taken. This is a gratifying phenomenon. Second, in terms of the composition of the works, the author's understanding of human anatomy is very profound, so that the various compositions he completes based on sketches are not only powerful and clear, with no wasted ink, but also create figures that look even more lifelike. It is precisely because of the author's profound understanding of human anatomy that the author is able to complete the third feature, which is: the versatility of expression methods. The author can use woodcut knives, ink or colored inks, and even oil painting brushes to express the same subject matter appropriately. The author not only focuses on "specialization," but also takes care of "breadth." Such efforts and achievements are also unmatched by ordinary painters.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Pond <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Feng</p>
<p>Green duckweed floats up, in pieces, in pieces, with very small area and volume. If you look at it from a distance, you can't see their roundness: where there is green duckweed, it looks like grass, and where there is no green duckweed, it looks like glass. The pond has changed its appearance!</p>
<p>The clear sky and branches are upside down on it, and it also embraces the long willow branches. Tourists and babies, groups of girls, and occasionally one or two small birds, as well as children's strollers that are painted very brightly, many shadows are all in the pond...</p>
<p>The pond in spring is a pond that has awakened. It is fertile and green, with strong 生侖 pigments. However, the most wonderful thing is that the shadows it collects still retain their original colors, which is different from the shadows anywhere else! So praises, exclamations, and children's screams all fall into this pond in spring.</p>
<p>It is really too beautiful, and the old man watching the pond has also forgotten to prohibit the children's naughty behavior: let fruit peels be thrown into the pond, let stones be thrown into the pond, let candy wrappers be rubbed into rice-like paper balls and thrown into the pond, let branches and leaves and the grass growing by the pond all be thrown into the pond... Therefore, can you say that he is a derelict old man, and mercilessly reprimand him, this is obviously a mistake.</p>
<p>Really, you can only say that spring is too beautiful. It beautifies the pond and beautifies everything by the pond. (April 12, Wenmiao)</p>
<h3 id="e166">Reverie on a Sailing Boat <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>This is an empty return boat. Except for the camphor wood boxes and Nanfeng oranges piled in the bottom cabin, there are fewer than thirty passengers and crew members.</p>
<p>All I can see is the very low visibility of the severe winter sky, flocks of geese that appear from time to time on the horizon, turbid and restless river water, tall and lonely masts that seem to have pierced the sky, and thick and thin ropes crisscrossing. All I can hear is the sound of a whistle once or twice.</p>
<p>Sometimes the embankment is close enough to count the number of floors of the pagoda on the bank, and sometimes it is far enough to only vaguely see some blurry gray shadows, making you strain your spirit to guess where are the trees? Where are the houses? Where is the pasture? Sometimes it is even farther, and even the blurry gray shadows are almost imperceptible.</p>
<p>Suppose you are the boat and the other party is the embankment, isn't this situation just like love? Sometimes she allows you to hold her hand and take a walk on a secluded path, sometimes she always frowns when she sees you, always saying "I have a terrible headache," sometimes you want to get a little news from her, which is a thousand times more difficult than climbing to heaven. The only difference is that the boat will eventually approach the embankment, and there are as many people whose love has no destination throughout their lives as there are sands in the Ganges.</p>
<p>I often stare at the two banks in the pilot house with binoculars. Due to the physical effect of these two pieces of glass, distant scenery becomes near, and scenery that is originally near becomes even closer. Of course, in fact, the distance between me and the embankment has not decreased by a single point. I have met many people who use illusions or hallucinations to replace the facts that they have no courage to admit. You find an environment or a reason to deceive yourself and satisfy yourself. You can preserve the bedroom furnishings of a relative who has died in a foreign land, believing that he will one day come back alive. Even if your lover has already formed a fairly happy family with someone else, you can believe that she still misses you day and night. I don't object to any of this. It's too bitter for people to insist on not being self-satisfied and self-deceiving.</p>
<p>Like the crisscrossing ropes on the boat, I thought of these things in my heart without any order. I wanted to learn the calmness of that mast, but I couldn't suppress my reverie.</p>

<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>—Yangzhou Continued Dreams, Twenty-seven</p>
<p>The author once said in the article "Tea Drinkers": "It is commonly said that the people of Yangzhou love 'skin wrapped in water in the morning, and water wrapped in skin in the evening.' 'Skin wrapped in water' refers to going to a tea house to drink tea, and 'water wrapped in skin' refers to going to a bathhouse to bathe." Regarding the matter of "skin wrapped in water," it has been mentioned many times, and now I will talk about "water wrapped in skin."</p>
<p>Perhaps because the people of Yangzhou love "water wrapped in skin in the evening," the bathhouses in Yangzhou seem to be more numerous than elsewhere. The Records of Painted Boats says: "The fashion of bathhouses began with Guo Tang in Shaobo Town. Later, Zhang Tang outside Xuning Gate followed suit. Zhang in the city followed its system in Xingjiao Temple to compete. Therefore, it was the same inside and outside the four cities. For example, Xiaopenglai at Kaiming Bridge, Baiyu Pond at Taiping Bridge, Luosiding at Quekoumen, Tao Tang at Xuningdou, Baisha Spring at Guangchumen, Xiaoshanyuan at Gengzishang, Qingying Spring at Beihexia, and Guanglingtao at Dongguan, each reached its peak. Outside the city, Gu Tang in Tanxiang and Xinfeng Spring in Beimen Street were the most famous." Some of these names of bathhouses that "each reached its peak" are still retained today, but times have changed, and the past and the present cannot be compared.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the pool. The Records of Painted Boats records: "And use white stone as the pool, more than a square zhang, divided into several large and small grids. The large one near the carved hot water is the large pool, the next is the medium pool, and the small one with not very hot water is the baby pool." The names of the large pool, medium pool, and baby pool were no longer heard in the author's childhood. All that was known were the first pool, the second pool, and the third pool, and the third pool was larger than the second pool, and the second pool was larger than the first pool. It must be because the baby pool is warm water, which is convenient for ordinary bathers, not just limited to babies, so the name had to be changed, and the area also had to be expanded. The first pool, which was "close to carved hot water," was not needed by everyone, so naturally its scope was reduced under the principle of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the seats. The Records of Painted Boats records: "The imitation clothes, arranged around the hall, are called seat compartments, and those on both sides are called standing compartments. The inside leads to a small room, called a warm room. After tea, fragrance, and wine, the waiter breaks off branches and massages, which is extremely luxurious." The so-called standing compartments could still be seen in the author's childhood, and most of their customers were coolies. In addition, the seat compartments were better, and the warm rooms were even more comfortable. Jushi Baisha Xing'an's Yangzhou Hao Baidiao wrote: "Yangzhou is good: bathing has a pool attendant. Those who support and follow the body act as crutches, and those who stroke the body make the guest forget fatigue, and the fragrant tea沁心脾!" This also refers to some customers in the warm rooms. These customers often have fixed "pool attendants." Whenever they take a bath, the fixed "pool attendant" will hold them in and out of the bath, and will be familiar with their customer's habits, such as how hot the feet should be, how to scrub the back, how long to stay in the pool, and whether they like hot water or not, and they will arrange everything properly so that the customer is comfortable, which is of course an "extremely luxurious" thing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, let's talk about customs. The Records of Painted Boats records: "Men enter the bath the night before the wedding, which costs dozens of gold. Bathing on New Year's Eve is called washing away the old, and bathing on the Dragon Boat Festival is called hundred herb water." The customs of "washing away the old" and washing "hundred herb water" still exist in small bathhouses today, but large and new bathhouses no longer have these names. As for spending money to bathe before the wedding, it is no longer seen today, but the author encountered it in his childhood. Because when the bridegroom enters the bath, someone always accompanies him, and he has to put on a new set of so-called "wedding clothes." Everyone sees and knows this, and the attendants and others will take the opportunity to ask for wedding money, and "dozens of gold" are spent in this way. In addition, there are customs that the author experienced in his childhood but no longer exist today. At the entrance of every bathhouse, there is a large "忍" (ren, meaning "endurance") written on the white wall facing you. Also, when every child first enters the bath, the adult leading him will bring a few "Shunzhi" coins and throw them into the pool. Later, Shunzhi coins became difficult to find, so copper coins were used instead. The meaning of writing "忍" is very puzzling. Some say that this is because everyone in the bath is "袒裼裸裎" (tan xi lu cheng, meaning "naked"), and collisions are inevitable. If you get angry, from cursing to fighting, the pool skin is hot, and the outside of the pool is eternally slippery, it is very easy to cause danger. Therefore, when customers enter the door, they are made to see the word "忍" so as to raise their awareness. As for children throwing copper coins when they first enter the bath, perhaps the intention is to seek good luck. Originally, the Chinese believed in polytheism, thinking that there were gods everywhere, and the bath also had gods in charge. Although bribery was rampant, it was precisely seeking their blessing!</p>

<h3 id="e170">Masaryk's Mood <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Xuanxuan</p>
<p>Recently, I read Xiao Qian's imitation "The Will of Masaryk" in "Observer." It is written "vividly" enough. If it is considered a literary work, that's fine, but I think the author will never admit that it was written and published as a literary work. What the author wants to express is a kind of thought or position that represents the author, precisely borrowing Masaryk's mouth to say his own words.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Qian mainly said that Masaryk was confident that he was a friend of democracy, and confident that the two kinds of democratic societies, "new" and "old," could coexist peacefully. He not only wanted to see the coordination of the two democracies, but also wanted to act as a bridge between them. But after all, he was "unfit to leave his native land for long." After seven or eight years, he finally "broke away" from Czechoslovakia. For a muddled liberation, he could only destroy himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao's article, as I said, is written quite "vividly," but not truthfully. Masaryk did dream of coordination between the East and the West, but his dream was ultimately shattered by reality. After the dream was shattered, he had to think about his future. In Czechoslovakia, he represented the link between Czechoslovakia and the so-called Western world, that is to say, his relationship with Britain and the United States was so close that without him, the Western world would lose Czechoslovakia. This point was seen as very important by a part of the Czech people, and it was also seen as very important by Masaryk himself. But democratic countries like Britain and the United States did not value the longing of a weak friend in the distance. They only valued him by the pound, completely with the face of a businessman, only paying attention to the value of the goods, but not paying attention to the relationship between people. In the years of exile, Masaryk tasted this kind of bitterness to the full.</p>
<p>The peace he dreamed of did not come, not only did it not come, but the situation reached a stage where he had to make a decisive decision. If he did not cooperate with the newly emerging force of the Czech Communists, he would have to go into exile again, but the taste of exile was bitter after all: living under someone else's roof, looking at their faces, fearing that he would be of no use to others. He had tasted that kind of taste enough, so he dared not taste it again.</p>
<p>Under the tension of thinking during the day and losing sleep at night, he accepted the post of Foreign Minister of the Czech Communist government. He thought: I have been a foreign minister for so many years, and now Czechoslovakia is still Czechoslovakia. Accepting this position of foreign minister is not shameful.</p>
<p>But he always felt uncomfortable, unsuitable, and unable to get along with them, and he didn't know why. In fact, it was his education and social background that made it impossible for him to adapt to this fateful new environment, no matter how "enlightened" you wanted to be. So he thought back and forth, distressed and in pain.</p>
<p>If he had greater confidence in his Western friends, he would be willing to go into exile again, but no. He understood best the difficulty of a weak person begging for food from a strong person. Thinking again that he was old and had seen enough of the vicissitudes of life, he didn't want to go abroad again to suffer the wind and dew and be bossed around. People of a certain age generally don't like to move around. He wanted to relive the good dreams of his childhood and cherish everything of the past, so he decided to stay.</p>
<p>But he also understood what role he was playing in this new environment. He was proud. After thinking about it for so many days, he felt that there was only one way to die. Just like famous generals and beauties, they leave the stage before they are old, giving people a good impression forever. I think Masaryk committed suicide in this mood.</p>
<p>To say that his suicide was only to resolve a psychological contradiction is incorrect. His suicide was a protest! A protest against the suppression of irresistible forces, which also meant non-cooperation. On the other hand, his suicide was a warning, warning some hypocritical people that he did not have much hope for them. Because he had been there, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment might be.</p>
<p>Masaryk's death was a tragedy of the times, almost a destiny. With Masaryk's thoughts and position, in this environment, to be cruel, death might have been the most appropriate way for him to deal with himself. What should be reflected on and understood deeply is the group of people who claim to be Masaryk's friends. How much help did they give him and the ideas he represented? Is the motive for helping beyond reproach? Half of his death was forced by you!</p>
<p>This may be a more approximate explanation. That's what I think.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Aftermath of Jinshan <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Qiaoling</p>
<p>Jinshan Temple, in a moment of carelessness on the peaceful and sunny sixth day of April, saw its essence reduced to ashes. The fire started in the storage room, spreading to the abbot's residence, the Sutra Repository, the Jade Buddha Hall, the Great Buddha Hall, and the reception room, etc. Only the Dharma Cave, the Guanyin Pavilion, and the seven-story pagoda remained unharmed. Due to the terrain, the fire brigade was helpless, managing only to save the mountain gate. However, the number of tourists not only did not decrease but actually increased, as everyone wanted to pay respects to this famous site after the disaster. Looking from the front of the mountain gate, the tourists were bustling and crowded, with no sign of the fire. After entering the gate, all that could be seen was rubble, a few withered trees, and steps that crumbled underfoot. The surrounding fire walls were tottering and about to collapse, causing anxiety. In front of the Great Buddha Hall, an incense tripod remained intact, and tourists sighed as they touched it. In addition, two or three tourists bent over in front of the walls of the Great Hall, as if searching for something, as it was rumored that there were priceless treasures hidden in the Buddhist statues. Behind the Great Hall, the Jade Buddha in the Jade Buddha Hall was broken, and the tiles were incomplete. Withered trees lay across the floor of the Sutra Repository, with the remaining scriptures, scorched by fire and stained with water, exposed to the sunlight. Some tourists said that a disciple of the abbot had warned of the disaster in advance and taught a method to avoid it, but it was not adopted, which is absurd and unfounded. The Jinshan incident was due to human error, for the following reasons: (1) The storage room contained a large amount of flammable materials such as petroleum and coal, and the ventilation was poor, so it could ignite spontaneously without a flame, which is easily predictable to those with scientific knowledge. (2) Lack of fire prevention equipment: The incident occurred during the day, and if there had been fire prevention equipment, it would not have been difficult to extinguish once discovered. (3) The buildings were adjacent and easily spread the fire. The Dharma Cave, Guanyin Pavilion, and Pagoda were not affected because they were far away from other buildings. (4) The fire started on the hillside, and the fire engines could not exert their power. Human planning was lacking, leading to the disaster of a famous site, which is regrettable. During my visit, a monk suddenly came, wearing a tattered robe and worn-out sandals, greeted me and asked: "Jinshan has been burned, what can you do?" He laughed as he spoke. I was surprised by his appearance and casually replied: "Ask the Buddha!" Someone knowledgeable told me: "This is a mad monk." So I took a few photos, felt disappointed and returned, and as I left and looked back, the Maitreya Buddha inside the mountain gate was still smiling in the setting sun.</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Spirit of Zhushui <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Haiyan</p>
<p>Regardless of how much the thoughts of Mr. Confucius were used by later emperors and rulers to suppress the people, Confucius himself was innocent and meritorious. He lived in a feudal era (in the narrow sense), and also an era of the gradual collapse of the feudal system. His propositions were precisely suited to the time. Later rulers obliterated his spirit of "being timely," attempting to "apply them to all ages," which had their own ulterior motives.</p>
<p>But his spirit of "education for all," is, in any case, a great idea. Although the rigid adherence to scholarship following him certainly hindered progress, the educational spirit, the great spirit of an educator with three thousand disciples, is still worthy of emulation by today's educators. But naturally, the wind of Zhushui and the scene of Apricot Altar over the years, can never be created by professors from the highest institutions in Beiping who cannot afford a bag of cheap flour and must weigh every ounce of flour to eat silk cakes every day. Confucius also experienced hunger, but that was on the road to Chen and Cai, driving a cart with two horses, anxiously pursuing the political ideal of implementing the realm, not the time of lecturing at the Apricot Altar. If Confucius's teaching spirit is still today's teaching spirit, educators must also strive for a stable environment where they are not in Chen and Cai every day. Otherwise, it is what Mencius called climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Edison's Hobbies <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Guoping</p>
<p>In addition to working in the laboratory, Edison loved literature, art and music very much.</p>
<p>When he was in Paris, he visited several museums, but he did not think that ancient works of art were supreme. He once said: "The reason why ancient works of art are famous in the world and so valuable is only because of the principle of 'rarity makes things valuable'." At the same time, he greatly appreciated the modern works of the Luxembourg, and he also collected many paintings in his own home.</p>
<p>Edison was extremely interested in music. Due to his enthusiasm and love, he invented the phonograph. Edison was particularly fascinated by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He asked someone to make a record of this set, and whenever he was free, he would sit down and listen carefully. Edison could also play a good organ and violin himself.</p>
<p>Edison was extremely satisfied with the works of the Victorian period, especially the two poets Longfellow and Tennyson. However, Edison's most admired was Shakespeare. Edison once said: "Ah, Shakespeare! He has great and profound ideals! If he engaged in scientific research, he would definitely be a super inventor. He seems to recognize the heart of everything. His creative ability to portray things will never be exhausted." However, Edison thought that Shakespeare's words were too profound and should be adapted into popular sentences.</p>
<p>Edison had a deep love for the beauty of nature. He loved flowers so much that he always liked to bring back a large bouquet of flowers of various colors when he went for a walk in the countryside. He often lingered in the countryside, loving the green trees, the fancy clouds, and the rolling mountains....</p>
<p>In these things, Edison realized the meaning of life and the true meaning of life. When he got up every morning, he always looked forward to the new day with a happy mind; when he went to bed every night, he always felt that the work of the day was purposefully completed.</p>
<h3 id="e174">"Procedures" <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Canxia</p>
<p>All "bureaucrats" are very particular about "procedures". The word "procedure" is originally something that should exist, and in some places, it is indeed something to be emphasized. However, once it falls into the hands of "bureaucrats", it becomes somewhat different.</p>
<p>In terms of corruption: as long as the procedures are complete, it is not easy for others to find evidence of crime. In terms of handling official business: the procedure has become a tool for shirking responsibility.</p>
<p>What is most annoying is that officials talk about procedures everywhere and at all times, "As long as my own procedures are done, I don't care if people die!" This sentence has become a mantra of civil servants, and as a result, it has become "procedure politics".</p>
<p>I say that procedures are like etiquette, and they should be required in places where they are indispensable, just like bowing when welcoming and seeing off guests. But if you use this etiquette too much, it will be annoying. It is clear that the most respectful salute only requires three bows, but you have to do six bows and nine bows. It is clear that when seeing off a guest, it is enough to walk to the door and give a bow, but you have to take a step and give a bow. Isn't this too annoying and too ridiculous!</p>
<p>I still have to say it separately. These so-called procedures are only emphasized by bureaucrats to deal with and restrain others, but they will neglect themselves. For example, our deputy secretary often takes out the leave slips of people who have overstayed their leave and points at them, saying: "This guy is no good, he overstayed his leave and didn't ask for an extension. He didn't do the procedures, damn it!" But what about himself? He often doesn't come for two weeks when he only asked for three days of leave.</p>
<p>From this, one can also imagine that the so-called "law" is only set up to manage people, and it seems that it is not needed for oneself, and it is not needed. "Procedures" are just like that!</p>

<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Life certainly does not need pearls and necklaces to embellish it, but it does not need too much garbage either.</p>
<p>There is no perfect thing in the world, because even if it is perfect, it is still missing a little bit - the beauty of imperfection.</p>
<p>It is impossible to live forever. In fact, even death is not very easy.</p>

<p>Contentment</p>
<p>The most precious thing in life is contentment, and contentment broadens the mind. Cool clouds rise at the end of the sky, wandering alone. Have a cup of tea to drink, have a glass of wine to taste, have a poem to chant, have a book to read, sleep soundly at night, walk back and forth in the painting, peach blossoms smile charmingly, green willows are planted in the wind, the spring light is荡荡, but the spring mood is gradually destroyed. Only the endless war makes people sad!</p>
<p>Worldly Fate</p>
<p>Killing aura fills the passes and rivers, what can be done with the remaining life! Often shed tears when facing flowers, sing aloud alone when watching the moon. White hair fills the head, yellow dust chases the shadow, there is nothing to love in the world, and loving brings much sorrow.</p>
<p>Rhyming with Jingzhai</p>
<p>Peach blossoms in twos and threes, a window of spring, willow branches with thousands of strands, fresh with rain. Today there is enough poetic material in the sunny garden, full of charm, beauty surpassing the dust.</p>

<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>In the fine days of spring and autumn, people from Shanghai who visit Yushan gather in Wangsi Restaurant for banquets; the traffic is heavy, reaching the height of the moment. Wangsi Restaurant is located at the mountain gate of Poshansi Temple. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was just a village shop. The owner, Wangsi, provided guests with yellow chicken, white wine, mountain delicacies and wild vegetables, which were quite authentic, and the wine was particularly mellow. The cost was not high, but one could get the pleasure of Tao Ran. Later, the business became more and more prosperous, and he rebuilt a three-room tall building, also equipped for grand banquets; people from other places flocked to it, and its value rose day by day, so that poor scholars did not dare to ask about it. Around 1935 and 1936, Yi Junzuo came to Yu, and after getting drunk, he waved his pen to the guests and presented a quatrain, and the name of Wangsi Restaurant spread throughout Jiangnan. It is said that last year, the Chairman's wife came here for a small drink in a light car and simple attire, and also praised its dishes as not bad. This year, a car park has been opened in front of the store, and the daily income is no less than that of a middle-class family. Although its dishes are still advertised as "yellow chicken, white wine, mountain delicacies and wild vegetables", in fact, mountain delicacies and seafood are available at a moment's notice, and the food is as big as a zhang, but its taste is also ordinary. The true taste is finally polluted by the popular custom, and thus the change of the world can also be glimpsed. However, Changshu's consumption is too high compared to its production, and it is difficult to establish any industry or commerce. Fortunately, Wangsi Restaurant and Ma Yongzhai can absorb foreign capital. Now that Wangsi has passed away, his son is humble and refined and works as an elementary school teacher.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Small Town <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Jiansheng</p>
<p>There are many small county towns under the jurisdiction of the provinces and cities in Jiangnan, but it is rare for a town like Hengfeng in eastern Jiangxi to be so small. Hengfeng County was Xing'an County in the Qing Dynasty, and is now passed through by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Its county seat is located in a valley, and there are only hundreds of houses in the city, which is not as big as a large town in other counties. It is only one li from east to west, so the locals have a saying: "Small Hengfeng County, three tofu shops; farting in the city, can be heard outside the city."</p>
<h3 id="e181">Ling <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that in Sichuan Province, another incident occurred in which a car driver destroyed a newspaper office, allegedly due to an article titled "Alas, Mr.". There are also events such as "car drivers", and details are not available from afar. Perhaps it was a playful piece of writing, with some light teasing, which caused resentment and evolved into a martial drama, which is also possible. As for the word "夫", it was originally a title for a noble status, without any humble meaning. The reason why Confucius was called "夫子" was because the old gentleman had been a "大夫", so adding the word "夫" to express respect. Otherwise, just the word "子" would be enough. In those days, scholars, even students to teachers (unemployed), only called so-and-so "子", and could not call them "夫". In operas, some prime ministers call themselves "老夫", but those who are only village elders and rich people, such as Deng Bodao, who sent his son to Sangyuan, and Lu Boshe, who captured and released Cao, only call themselves "老漢", and cannot call themselves "老夫". Also, in the previous dynasties, women below the third rank were only called Shuren, Gongren, Yiren, Anren, Ruren, and only those of the first and second rank could be called "夫人". Men of the first to fifth rank were "大夫", and those below the sixth rank were only called "郞". The Book of Rites says: "夫者, 以知帥人者也." The character is "一大", and its meaning is "to lead others with knowledge", so it can be relied upon and called "丈夫", a man of integrity and courage, a steel "大丈夫", a hero. As for sedan chair carriers, coachmen, and drivers, they are also in charge of their duties and responsible for their responsibilities. In the past, people generally valued officials and gentry, so they forcibly added a "亻" to the word "夫" to make "伕", presumptuously pretending to be clever, which is not sufficient as evidence.</p>
<p>It is also heard that some people strongly advocate changing "夫" to "駕駛員". According to the word "員" is a counting word, such as "幾員大將" "一員官", which is often seen in general records and novels and dramas. "官員" and "職員" are indeed in the official rank, while "會員" and "雇員" are civilian in style. Since the Republic of China, we have been wary of bureaucratic habits and changed "官" to "公務員" (the combined sound of these three characters is still the word "官"), saying that they are personnel serving public affairs, different from "私務員". If so, then anyone who drives for an organization to deliver official documents can also be called a "公務員", not just a "駕駛員"? For thirty years, terms such as rickshaw puller and coachman have been popular for a long time, and there has never been any objection. Only in recent years, "air travel" has become popular, and its drivers are often called drivers and not "夫". Some say, airplanes have engines, why don't cars have engines? Drivers who fly in the air are no longer called "夫", so why shouldn't drivers who drive on land be called "員"? Because they all have "engines", this is true, but if cars follow the example of airplanes, then "three-wheelers" can also follow the example of cars, because they are all "cars", although there is no engine to drive, but they have never driven without driving. Therefore, "two-wheelers" can also follow the example of three-wheelers, because three-wheelers and two-wheelers are the same "wheel", and there is no "engine". For the sake of public welfare and the friendship of peers, we should plan comprehensively and think for the two-wheelers. If they are also called drivers, then they are dragged along, and it is really impossible to talk about driving. If they are allowed to be in the corner and not to be treated the same as the above three items, then there is a loss of integrity. There are still quite a few two-wheelers in the north now, and we must consider a proper name for them to show justice.</p>
