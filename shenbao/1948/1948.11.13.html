<h3>當前的嚴重情勢　不是危機是轉機　傅作義在總理誕辰紀念會演講</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十二日電〕北平紀念國父八三誕辰大會，傅總司令作義在會中講話：「今天是總理八十三歲誕辰紀念日，我們紀念總理，眞有無限慚愧·我們革命幾十年，到今天還不能完全實現總理的主義，民生凋敝，國運艱危，言念及此，實不勝其感慨</p>
<p>現在華北每一個人心裏都感到嚴重的威脅，由於東北戰局的變化，會使東北的敵人加到華北來，給華北增加了壓力，我們檢討東北軍事的失利是否戰敗，只能說是由於我們本身的潰亂，並不能證明是匪軍厲害，共匪叛亂以來，我們軍事失利部份，政治的失敗，誠然是事實，但都是失敗在本身的腐敗無能上，使共匪得到局部一時的便宜，共匪能打了腐敗無能，因爲貪汚腐化就應該失敗，有人打，他會失敗，沒有人打，也會失敗，但共匪的極權恐怖殘忍，絕不能戰勝我們民主自由和平的理想，在目前情勢之下，展望華北前途，我認爲與其說是危機，母寗說是生機，目前有困難，但我們却有更大的信心克服困難，渡過困難，從無數慘痛的血淚事實中，華北人民的認識已經提高了，對問題眞的深刻瞭解的，切實知道中國今日的戡亂戰爭不是簡單的普通內戰，不是政權的爭奪，更不應該是爲保護豪門，保護特權，而是民生自由和平與極權恐怖殘忍兩種不同生活方式的鬥爭，只有戡亂成功，中國人民才有民主自由，才能享受獨立自主國家國民的權利，才能延續我們良好的文化傳統，倫常道德，和諧的家庭生活和宗敎信仰的自由，才能保持，如果共匪統治了中國，中國人民將不會再有民主再有自由，把中國人民關進鐵幕內，陷入極權暴處殘忍恐怖和無止境的戰爭中去。共匪最近又宣傳他們有些地方可以停止淸算鬥爭，表示他們所謂的「寬大政策」，但華北人民對匪區的眞實情形，知道的太淸楚了，對共匪淸算鬥爭的殘酷，永遠不會忘記，也能織透共匪所謂停止淸算鬥爭的宣傳是毒計，是欺騙，共匪本身的歷史，就是最好的證明。共匪的背景和他所師承，所學習的一套策略，更足以說明共匪的所謂「寬大政策」，只是一個很短時期的利用和手段，越是被共匪統治時間較久的地方，人民痛苦越深，恨匪越甚，對共匪眞面目知道的越澈底，正確認識就會成爲有力的行動，形勢越嚴重，華北人民的意志越集中，任務越艱鉅，我們的力量越强大。</p>
<p>華北國軍，我敢親最大多數不是腐化的，他們都是有目的，有理想，爲主義，爲人民犧牲奮鬥的，爲他們自己沒有任何要求，正因爲如此他們吃最粗的飯，穿最不好的衣服，走最難走的路，打最激烈的仗，他們永遠不頹喪，永遠不失望，各部隊之間，充滿了協同友愛互助合作的精神，常能自動支援完成共同的整體的要求·此次東北作戰，如果友軍間能按計劃互相支援，不惟不是敗仗，而且是一個大勝仗，我們可以肯定的說，爲享受·爲個人的軍官必失敗，爲主義，爲人民·有目的，有理想的軍隊必成功，必勝利。（下文轉第二版）</p>

<h3>恢復硬幣的流通以後</h3>
<p>近來物資缺乏的恐慌，特別是米，柴，雜糧農產品·大家知道，是由於各地方的擅加攔阻，和農民的不願出售。關於前者，只消中央漢汗大號，執法以繩，就不難消弭了，關於後者，却非從挽回幣信上着手不能奏效。因為貨幣原具有兩種作用，一為交換的尺度，二為價値的儲藏；在這通貨膨脹，物價劇烈波動的時候，這兩種作用，幾於完全失效，無怪「重物輕幣」的觀念，更深入於一般人心了。</p>
<p>當局諱言發行政策的失敗，從前常把這項責任，全部轉嫁到投機操縱的奸商們身上去，以為物價飛漲，和物資缺乏，完全是他們作祟的結果。非到各地農民留產品，拒絕不賣，造成了目前那樣普徧糧荒的現象，大約還不願率直地承認錯誤，而在貨幣的本身問題上，採取有效的補救辦法。</p>
<p>準備鑄發硬幣，准許銀元流通，這就是徐財長上台後所定的有效補救辦法。不管恢復硬幣，乃至依舊恢復銀幣，在幣制上，是不是開倒車，而在這紙幣信用，顯然發生了動搖之時，這項措置，自不失其對症發藥的作用。因為這是一種硬幣，其本身原具有相當高貴的價値，與濫發的紙幣不同；法幣的流通雖已經過了十餘年的歷史，而一般人民對於它的信仰，仍沒有完全失去。在金圓券尙未問世之前，內地有許多地方，還宣把它作為交易的媒介，並且還零星地搜藏起來，作為保持剩餘購買力的對象。所以把銀元准許流通，作為法定的通貨之一，這不但是投其所好，可以改變其「重物輕幣」的觀念，而且以銀元與金圓券確定了相互間的比率卽一對十以後，亦可以間接地提高金圓券的價値，從而穩定了目前極度混亂中的物價；至於這一部份硬幣和生金銀之廢物利用，和無數持有人之免蹈法網，尤其餘事。</p>
<p>所困難的，是：（一）根據良貨幣驅逐惡貨幣的原則，此類硬幣，一經公開流通，恐怕爭相收藏，依舊得不到理想中的效用，試看最近一分銅幣的紛紛擠兌，朱見流通，便是一個實例；（二）廿四年推行法幣時，各地銀幣，大部份已經收回，運往國外，而在「八·一九」至十月底前，又重行收兌了一批，民間藏銀，恐已為數無幾；（三）現在雖決定開鑄一至百圓的金銀硬幣，但新幣原料之補充，與開廠鼓鑄的手續，俱不是一件很簡單的事。因此要恢復幣信，使大家樂於接受，把物資照常地流通出來，其關鍵仍在於發行額的確實節制，與爽快地准予兌換金銀。</p>
<p>「八·一九」後所收兌的金銀外幣，聞其總額達到美金二億元左右，按照現在重訂的比率，金圓券的價値，無形中，已貶低了四倍，那麽，只消動用此數的二分之一，巳不難將巳發行的金圓券悉數收回。所以在金圓未鑄成以前，如能酌定辦法，迅速地准予兌取黃金或銀幣，而不作存滿一年等額兌現的硬性規定，則金圓券自可迅速回籠，而其價値亦卽可立時增高起來，從而物資的交流，和薪資的水準，均不難於短期內重行調整。此次所附存滿一年等額兌現的兌換條件，在吸收通貨，與防止資金的外逃上，雖容有其相當的意義，但就金圓券持有人的方面看來，究嫌美中不足。</p>
<p>至於金圓券的發行總額，此次巳不作硬性規定，而改為「另以命令定之」，其唯一的節制辦法，為發行準備監理委員.，如發現準備不足時，得通知央行伴止發行。故此項監理委員會之組織，我們認為應由立院監院及全國性的金融工商業組織分別派員參加，以資監察，而昭大信。好得該會的組織規程，尙待政院擬定，一項建議，深盼當局卽予採納，以慰衆望。</p>
<p>自翁內閣成立以來，所作經濟上的重大改革，此次已屬第三次，人民在創鉅痛深之餘；咸抱有一種迅求安定的急切心理·因為每經一度改革，卽不免發生一度紛擾與損失，而最近各地所普徧發生的物資缺乏現象，巳使一般民衆，不論是有錢的或無錢的，同樣地這受到生活上的痛苦，俱惶惶然不可終日·現在政府旣已覺察到過去貨幣政策的失敗，因而恢復硬幣，拿出實物來挽救幣信；對於目前瘋狂上漲的物價，自能發生穩定的作用，尤其在銀根逼緊的今日，更容易發生抑平物價的功效·但政府對於發行硬幣，必須具有絕大的決心，務須做到不再發行金圓券的先決條件·我們相信，唯有在不再發行金圓券的條件下，鑄發金銀硬幣，才能奏收縮通貨抑平物價的功效·反之，如若一面鑄發金銀硬幣，一面又聰任通貨繼續膨脹，金圓券與硬幣同時流通市面，必發生「劣幣驅逐良幣」的現象，市面流通的仍是金圓券，對於物價自亦不能發生穩定的作用。</p>

<p>我剛說過，中國今日的剿匪戡亂是兩種不同生活方式的鬥爭，我們是在維護國家獨立與尊嚴，爭取政治民主，經濟平等，生活自由，實現三民主義這一崇高的政治理想，為世界和平而戰，為自由民主而戰，為中國人民眞正的和平與普遍的生活安定而戰，所以今天剿匪戡亂意義不是消極的，而是積極的，不是保守的，而是革命的，這就是剿匪戡亂戰爭的本質，也就是我們力量的源泉，我們如果不顧做關在鐵幕裏的奴隸，而選擇民主自由和平這個生活方式，就應該把自己的力量參加到剿匪戡亂的陣營裏來，因為力量是大家的，不是一個人的，自己的願望，要由自己來爭取，也祗有自己的力量最可靠，華北國軍的力量是堅强的，在人民的團結支持之下，必能達到人民的願望，完成剿匪戡亂的任務。</p>
<p>目前我們要以下列各項重點，普遍深入地展開軍事，政治，經濟，文化密切配合總體戰的工作：（一）澈底淸匪除奸，安定內部，鞏固後方，把製造謠言，挑撥是非，陰謀破壞的奸匪潛伏份子，用人民的力量淸除出去·（二）發揮堅强的戰鬥力，士氣高漲，技術純熟，殲滅敵人。（三）經濟與人民利益一致，工作與生活連結起來，權利與義務連結起來，尤其要特別保障勞苦同胞的生活。（四）反貪汚，反腐化，保證政治廉能。（五）打破私人派系恩怨，所有的人員，所有的部份主動的配合工作，把所有的力量都變成戰鬥力量。（六）人民的力量團結起來，軍政民協同一致，密切配合，爭取勝利。</p>
<p>今天情勢的嚴重，是嚴重到要我們急起直追，發揮最大力量，必可創造最大成就的時候，並不是嚴重到不可作為，今天嚴重的局面，不是危機，正是轉機，正是生機，我們要堅定信心，使出決心，用團結的力量，一致的意志，勇敢的行動，增强我們力量，壯大我們力量，一切智慧用於剿匪，一切力量用於前綫，努力必然成功，勝利不是坐待的，一切退後的想法，都是死路。我們華北人民團結起來，一致奮起，前途是無限光明，無窮希望的。</p>
<p>剿匪戡亂，是為拯救中國人民現在的苦難和創造眞正和平，永久幸福·並不是為了某一個人或某一部份人，以作義個人來說，我沒有財產需要保護，也不是為維持我的官來打仗，更不是為了個人的享受，如果說我是為了享受，相信大家都知道我享受了些什麼，可以說只有議牲，但是我很堅決，很努力，堅決努力是基於對主義的信仰，對時代的認識，對理想的追求，完全出於對國家和人民的眞誠，為了國家人民，甘願犧牲自己，我也相信我們的軍政幹部和全體戰友與我是同一的認識，不是為了一個位置和幾個錢，而是有理想，有認識，有抱負，有志氣，為革命盡忠，為人民服務，大家可隨時不預先通知，看看我們軍師長的生活，他們雖然苦，但是他們從不懂得苦悶，從不消極，幹得非常有勁。</p>
<p>眞理只有一個，救國救民救自己的剿匪戡亂戰爭，必然勝利，當抗戰初期，我們就相信廿世紀是民族復興的時代，不管日本力量多麼强大，抗戰最後也成功·今天我們也確信，民主自由一定能戰勝極權恐怖，雖然艱苦在所不免，但只要有決心，準備迎擊艱難，華北同胞富有堅苦勇毅的精神，大家團結起來，作義願意追隨華北同胞，在蔣總統領導之下，在人民的意志之下，為實現我們的願望來努力來奮鬥·（完）</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎十二日電〕美代表奧斯朋今日在聯大政委會中指出蘇聯軍力龐大，據稱，蘇聯有軍隊四百萬名，蘇聯控制下各國復有二百八十萬名，兩者共同戰鬥部隊二首五十師，等於西方國家軍隊總額之五倍·第二次世界大戰結束以來，蘇聯並未幫助促成國際信賴，例如柏林問題卽直接拒絕六中立國之調處方案。奧氏最後對比利時所提建議表示支持。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十二日電〕美代表奧斯朋，又指賈蘇聯企圖製造世界革命·渠稱，蘇聯武備充份，且正企圖推翻世界各地逍剩之代議制政府·蘇聯力能發動侵略戰爭，以繼續攻侵其他國家。蘇聯以其人力及資源之大部用於備戰，西方國家則異於是·發動政府控制下之宣傳機構，促令人民備戰者，亦僅蘇聯一國·奧氏演說時，正値聯大政委會辯論蘇聯所提五强在一年內裁軍三分之一之建議，其言亦兼以答覆蘇代表維辛斯基十一日之長篇譴責美國計劃侵略性戰爭之演說。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕在第一次大戰停戰紀念日，法總統歐禮和發表演說稱，「我人必須贏得和平，我人不應忘記第一次大戰後引向第二次慘禍之錯誤，我人決不能予以重犯。全歐洲在精神與物質方面深受德國之蹂躪，如使德國逃避賠償之義務。又對德國再侵略之控制無確切之保證，宣欠公允」。歐禮和總統强調德國之重工業區必須由國際管制，渠稱，「我人堅持決不允許任何藐視經驗公理與謹愼之經濟措置存在。德國固然應對歐洲之復興有所貢獻，然吾人不能允許魯爾之軍火廠重入希特勒徒衆或日後將威脅世界和平之德人手中·魯爾為國際共有，由國際共管，乃保證歐洲及德人民本身之安全之唯一辦法。」</p>

<p>蘇文學報評美國大選</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十一日合衆電〕文學報載稱：美國人民代表和平與民主百由，而反對戰爭販子，與資本主義之暴政。該報解釋此次美國大選之結果且謂，事實昭示吾人，此次結果並非對於杜魯門較為親切，但人民係選舉「禍害較小」者，「杜魯門較偽裝之反動份子之杜威為佳，因杜威係具有明顯之法西斯觀念，萬惡不赦之好戰者之一也」。</p>

<h3>蔣廷黻舌戰維辛斯基　責蘇干涉我內戰　驅使日戰俘助共黨作亂</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十一日電〕中國代表蔣廷黻今日在聯大政委會指責蘇聯所提裁軍案，實為間接干涉中國內政，渠繼稱蘇聯政策乃造成亞洲最大憂患之一種因素，蘇聯提議五大國裁軍三分之一，事實上削弱中國戡亂力量。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十一日電〕在所有外交家一致認為注定失敗之裁軍問題討論中，蔣廷黻與蘇代表維辛斯基大起衝突。蔣氏率直反對蘇聯最近所提出五强裁减三分之一軍備之建議，在宣佈中國不能在對共黨作戰中削减實力時，渠指出聯合國對達到世界和平目的所採取之首要步驟，應為「解除中國，希臘，朝鮮境內第五縱隊之武裝，及世界各地所有第五縱隊之武裝」。蔣廷黻控斥蘇聯在第二次大戰中所獲之八萬日戰俘，現正在協助中共，其中五萬人係在東北作戰，三萬人作為共黨之技術專家。此為在公開辯論中對蘇聯援助中共之最率直之譴責。</p>
<p>維辛斯基在答覆時宣稱，渠懷疑中國之裁軍，『將否對中國「人民」與中國軍隊間大戰之結果有任何影響，此一戰爭現顯示「人民」之煌輝勝利』。渠指斥中國深恐將裁軍，因中國需要「每輛坦克每枚砲彈每一兵士及每枝槍械，以應付及處置中國「人民」。蔣廷黻宣稱。「此間蘇聯代表團之言與蘇聯政府之熊度，其距離猶如南轅北轍」。蔣氏復解釋稱，「中國目前正在進行嚴重之內戰，與八十八年前之美國及一九一七年時之蘇聯正復相同。倘有任何人向林肯提議裁軍，林肯定當認為不友好行為。假如國際聯盟在三十年前勸吿列寗裁軍，列寗亦必付之一笑，斥此議含有惡意」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十一日電〕蔣廷黻氏攻擊蘇聯利用日戰俘一事，引起蘇代表維辛斯基之猛烈抨擊，維氏向該會主席史巴克氏謂，主席竟容忍此「對蘇聯之無恥攻擊」，實令人不解。維辛斯基强調主席之不能使代表表示禮節，且謂「余僅能獲得一結論，卽蘇聯代表必須自行保衛其尊嚴，而不復能依賴主席擔任工作」。史巴克僅請各代表停止其他意外，使此事吿一段落。</p>
<h3>遠委會美方代表拒絕蘇對日要求</h3>
<p>日已解除武裝蘇儘可放心</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕遠東委員會今日例會，美代表麥考埃以强硬語氣拒絕蘇聯大使潘友新加緊參加管制日本之要求。麥氏聲明要點有三：（一）日本早已澈底解除武裝，美國認為日本不會再度發動侵略，蘇聯儘可放心。（二）美國已一再提議及早恢復日本平時經濟，恰如蘇聯期望，</p>
<h3>由於自由黨內部分裂　希臘內閣總辭職　蔡爾達里斯繼任閣揆呼聲最高</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典十二日電〕希臘總理蘇福理斯十二日終於實踐宿諾，提出內閣總辭職。希王保祿可望立卽開始物色新閣揆，外長蔡爾達里斯繼任之呼聲最高，按蔡氏為議會第一大黨人民黨黨魁。蘇氏之辭職起因，由於自由黨之內部分裂，副黨魁委尼瑞洛斯十一日自動宣布不再信任政府，而加速蘇氏之去職。然渠最近亦多次揚言辭職，上週末最後一次表示辭意，然同意在聯合國辯論希臘問題終了前，繼續供職。</p>
<h3>暹內閣改組　部長數人將更換</h3>
<p>因國會及人民指政府無能</p>
<p>〔聯合社盤谷十一日電〕暹羅總理鑾披汶今日宣布，內閣將局部改組，更換新部長數人。因國會及民間指斥政府之無能，引起各部長個別辭職·預料財政·商務·內政·與交通各部均將更換人事。</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯提議由關係各國管制日本工業數年，勢必繼續至對日和約簽訂之後，此非遠東委員會職權所及。和約成立後，日本卽當受和約之節制，遠東委員會已無權管轄。麥氏最後稱，蘇聯之提議無補實際，本委員會對解除日本軍備已有遠大政策，由麥帥執行。再者蘇聯在遠東委員會及東京盟國管制委員會中均有直接發言權，自無更張旗幟必要。至於所謂美軍正在重建橫須賀軍港一節，並無其事。</p>
<h3>李承晚宣布　韓閣將局部改組</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十二日電〕韓國總統李承晚今日向報界談稱：聯合國大會討論韓國閱題之後，韓國丙閣或將局都改組。按國會日前要求總統加强內閣陣容。</p>

<h3>總統關懷滬市糧食　吳市長提二點建議　當晚離京返滬對物價前途表示樂觀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕滬市長吳國楨奉召來京出席糧食會議，十二日晨自滬抵京，因糧食會議已展期至十三日舉行，吳氏十二日在京晋謁總統及翁院長後，巳於十二日夜車返滬。吳氏十二日晨十時半晋謁總統，報吿滬市情况，總統對滬市目前物價糧食等問題，垂詢甚詳。吳氏並提出有關糧食之建議二項：（一）各省不得阻運糧食出境。（二）糧食不應征稅。總統均表示首肯。旋復晋謁翁院長，作相同之報吿與建議。據吳氏十二日晚談，滬市糧食問題，已有通盤解決辦法，港米運抵滬後，十月份之糧食配售不足之額，卽可補足，以後美援糧食源源運到，滬市糧食決可無虞。最近數日滬市糧食供應已趨正常，糧價日有下跌，適於此時政府復公佈修正金元券發行辦法，金銀外幣人民可以持有，相信以後物價糧價均可有較長時期之穩定。</p>

<p>自修正金圓券發行辦法及人民所有金銀外幣處理辦法發佈後，本市一般情形，反響均好，昨日各種物價，多未續漲，尤以香烟一項，價格慘跌，零售捲烟如三砲台曾一度每包售至十八元，昨日每包七元，白錫包每包從十七元跌至八元，二十支前門每包從十元跌至五元五角。至於食米情形，更形穩定，昨日本市各米店，均有雪白大米出售，每祖標價八百元，但甚少問津，究其原因，乃因數額甚巨之洋米，日內卽可抵滬，贛省南昌食米一批，亦已空運來滬，而本市各戶，因市區不易購得，日來均紛紛自行赴附近各鄉收買，故米價之漲勢已挫。昨日本市北站一帶，沿寳山路北河南路臨時米攤密佈，均以斗及升零售，每斗喊價七十元，然問津者依然寥寥。</p>

<h3>淮南煤鑛全貌</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　竇白萍</p>
<p>〔本報九龍崗七日訊〕在戰局沉重國內許多工鑛事業遭受毀滅的今天，我們對於與南京直綫距亂一百六十公里的皖北淮河南岸的淮南煤鑛，格外珍視它的繁榮和滋長。提起淮礦，從它的歷史過程，生產實况和未來美景，面對着目前普遍煤荒的現實，記者首先籲請政府對距離首都最近的這個淮礦，應該特別加以扶持協助，使它在建國道途上充份發揮所能付出的力量。淮鑛現有九龍崗，大通，八公山三個鐵塲，全鑛區佔地上面積有四十七萬公畝。</p>
<p>採煤情形現在九能大通兩塲共有豎井十二座，斜井兩座，分別供應煤斤，提升材料，輸送人員上下，及通風之用。井下開拓工程，在石層或頂底堅固的煤層，開擊大巷，每隔一百至一百五十公尺，開石門一道，穿透各煤層，再沿煤層開煤巷，由煤巷每三十至四十公尺，向上開煤眼，並開四十五度的上山眼，用便運料。然後每高十五公尺，開順槽一道，順槽間的煤限，左右錯開三四公尺，計開順槽五道，達到上位的老硐。到今天，各鑛塲地下開拓工程，最深的已有三百三十公尺了。</p>
<p>鑛工採煤，在煤限和順槽開妥後，分煤為若干方，利用陷落法，由上之順槽開始回採，土名為「落垜」，就是先把最內的一方下部掘空，使其上部自行落下，由內向外逐步回採。據說鑛工對這種方法倒很熟練，不過回採率只百分之六十左右，採頂底堅固煤層時，打算完全用倉柱法，這種方法去年八月在大通鑛東部二百四十公尺位六道石門南一槽已經使用，成績還好，只因鑛工技術生疏，現在仍在改進中。</p>
<p>搬運煤斤，在順槽內全賴人工，由煤眼放下到煤巷，裝進煤車，車行鋼軌上，由人力推經石門到大巷，再用絞車罐籠提升到地面。九龍南礦塲三百三十公尺位現改用柴油機車運煤，正裝置中，大通礦塲三百三十公尺位用無極繩拖車運煤，並有無極帶運送機四套，由井口直送篩選機，篩選後送至煤倉。</p>
<p>設備一斑</p>
<p>採煤設備，經過一點一滴血汗的累積，現在各式鍋爐二十九座，各式電氣和蒸氣絞車二十四部，壓風機七部，電泵三十部，煤車一千二百零二輛，風鍋風錘以及機廠設備，都應有盡有。</p>
<p>電力取給於田家菴的淮南電廠，該廠發電容量九二〇〇KM，用二二〇〇〇弗高壓輸送至各礦，經各礦變電站變為三三〇〇弗，或三八〇——二二〇弗，分別發動大小機器。</p>
<p>卅五年在九龍南用土法煉焦，三十六年又增大通練焦塲，經過努力與改良，今年八月底共產焦一二七八噸，聽說銷行南京頗受歡迎。</p>
<p>三年有成</p>
<p>從三十四年勝利接收到今年，時間恰成」淮鑛在三年中充實設備，增產煤量，現在規模已具。一個生產事業，它的發展就在增加產量淮礦接收後經過整理，便增建新井，計增加三座新井和一座新風井，値得特別提出報道。</p>
<p>大通三號井，日本人佔領期間，巳擬定開鑿，復員後繼續施工，去年年底已鏧至三四六公尺位，內徑六公尺，石砌井圈，鋼筋混凝土的井樓，設自動換車爬車，井架高四十公尺，全用鋼料，一千匹馬力汽絞車一部，罐籠上釘雙軌，可容零點八五噸煤車四部，井下大巷開在石層內，全部工程設備已吿完成，今年十月開始使用，日出煤斤三千噸。這個井是淮礦設備最新的。記者到時不幸正停工修理，原打算下井參觀的願望，乃致吿吹。七號井是去年一月開工，今年十月已發三三〇公尺，礦長張光正說：預計總深四二〇公尺，明年六月完成。內徑五公尺，也是石砌井圈，石旋後注以四十公分混凝土，電絞車一部，六百匹馬力。九龍崗礦塲三號井原深一七七點五公尺，三十五年七月開工接深，去年底完工，接深至三三〇公尺，絞車房已完工，自動罐在設計製造中，預計日出煤斤二千五百噸。</p>
<p>大通九龍崗兩礦之間，開大風井一座，預定總深三三〇公尺，去年五月開工，現已達一八〇公尺，內徑五公尺，分兩口出風，裝離心式抽風機兩部，三七五匹馬力，每分鐘旋轉六百次，風量每分鐘四萬一千六十立方公尺，風壓二百五十公分。</p>
<p>新的計劃</p>
<p>淮礦現有三個礦場，煤的蘊藏量共有五億五千萬噸，照目前日產量四千噸計算，可開採三百八十二年，礦局日夜殫精竭慮在求增產，而本身為一公營事業，限於財力，煤斤不會自動出井，値此動亂年頭，貸款困難殊多，現在芷指望於明年三月三百五十萬的美援貸款，新計劃初稿業已完成，王局長說如果按計劃前進，兩年後日產量可遠一萬五千噸，這個數字正相等開深目前的產量·就這樣下去，可開採一百年。</p>

<p>原子核心的研究，在美國長島的布羅克哈溫（離紐約六十五英里處）突飛猛進地進行着，該地已成為原子核心研究的中心地·美國東北各地的天才科學家，均在該地的國立布羅克哈溫實驗所裏，集中全力增進人類對於原子核心力的智識及其有利之用途，同時，並訓練許多靑年科學家，繼續研究這個工作。</p>
<p>增進應用知識</p>
<p>此項工作研究主要之目的，是原子力及其物質本身性質之基本研究，亦卽致力研究原子對於文化及建設方面之用途，預料此項工作能在醫藥，農業及工業各方面的應用智識均有所增進。</p>
<p>在醫藥方面，放射性碘，目下已可用於治療各種毒瘤症，放射性磷，亦可為醫藥治療之用。該實驗所的科學家，將研究該兩元素各個放射性的微亳之差。將來更希望與外問各醫院合作，共同研究放射性，對於動脈之硬化，糠尿病及退化病各方面，可有更大的發現。放射性同位素，對於農業的研究，業已由科學家分區實驗。據布羅克哈溫的理事長摩爾斯博士說：關於農業方面之前途，確有令人興奮之處。</p>
<p>研究工作目標</p>
<p>關於許多撰述原子能的作家的「原子夢」，卽如何利用小如蠶豆的原子發動機駕使橫渡大西洋的輪船，雖然科學家們尙未加以研究，可是布羅克哈溫的科學家不能地在研究放射性碳的，已經過相當時間了。放射性碳是由爆炸性氣及中性電子製成，故當其研究工作完成時，預料可簡化煉油的方法。</p>
<p>據摩爾斯博士宣稱：布羅克哈溫有三個目標：</p>
<p>（一）澈底尋求一種新的智識，使原子能應用于和平與幸福之途（二）訓練靑年科學家去繼續工作（三）掃除人類對「原子」的恐懼心理。</p>
<p>戰勝恐怖心理</p>
<p>美國長島的居民，當他們聽到「原子研究中心建在布羅克哈温」的消息後，他們曾很恐怖地說：原素的放射性會殺死長島的「　」，趕掉長島的「鴨」，毀壞長島的土壤，以及使畏島的咖啡變成苦味。其實，布羅克哈溫並不是炸彈實驗室，也絕對不是軍事性的機關。</p>
<p>布羅克哈溫實騐所的產生已有一年多了。所內的設備雖未充份完成，但是工作却穩健地進行着。</p>
<p>現在該所雇用了一千多人，大多數係長島從事工程工作的土人，他們已戰勝對原子的恐懼心理，從事於建築一個巨大的核子反應器。</p>
<p>科學家二百人</p>
<p>該實驗所內經常研究的科學家，將有二百人，此外尙有見習人員二百餘人。他們將由美國東北各地的大學及教育機關抽派來此。科學家中有許多是美國物理學會的會員，化學調味專家，天文學家及生物化學家等，他們大多數都是四十歲以下的靑年</p>
<p>管制尙稱自由</p>
<p>該實驗所的職員雖然被國會的條例管制得很嚴，尤其在原子能方面，依規定須嚴密監視，但是，與軍事管理比較起來，却相當的自由，因為該實騐所的大門，僅有一個警察及一位中年的土著在守衛着。遊客可在該所附近地區遊覽，絲毫不受干涉。在原子堆製造的位置，遊客，旅行者及其他參觀者，當然要在相當的距離外止步，然而，一切的治安條例却形成了布羅克哈溫的空氣輕鬆而偷快。</p>
<p>摩爾斯博士說：「當我們開始工作的時候，我們很難羅致科學家，因為他們不願意在政府監視下工作。因此，我們便根除監視的束縛，發展成為一種「大學的自由作風」，所以到現在為止，工作的表現相當優異」。（廣新譯）</p>

<h3>黔省調整縣級機構　待遇將予提高</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉孟痴</p>
<p>〔太報貴陽八日航訊〕黔省此次調整縣級機構，其旨趣之一是在提高待遇，因為邊地省份的縣級機構人員的待遇之低，實遠非京滬平津等大都市的人們所能想像。目前黔省附近省垣的縣份公敎人員，如秘書科長之類在縣鄉之間已屬相當顯赫的人物，可是他們母月所得還不超過金圓六元。這次調整方案規定，職員部份，規定暫按底薪以金圓十元為基數，十元以上每超過十元折發金圓一元，如縣府秘書科長委任一級待遇底薪為二百元，則可獲薪金廿九元。其有財政充裕縣份，生活程度較高，則可自行提高，以至比照省級待遇為止，藉以達到同工同酬的目的。兵警部份，月給主食費一元，副食費一元，餉四元。主食費按定量發給實物，收回價款轉賬。技工伏役部份，則月給工資五元。</p>
<p>裁汰冗員整頓稅捐</p>
<p>調整方案，黔省府規定自卅八年一月份起實行，但方案內容，省府卽於最近頒發各縣作為準備實施的張本，各縣於奉令之後，卽一面着手裁員，所有被裁人負薪金，一律發至本年年底為止，以示體卹。一面切實整頓各項稅捐，澈底革除中飽，根絕偷漏，以期收入增加·各縣如能於調整公敎人負待遇之外，分配一部事業經費，以為推進各項建設事業之用，最為適合理想。至於貧瘠縣份，由省府另行設法統籌補助，並希望於短期之內，達到自給自足的境地。</p>
<p>振作精神奉公守法</p>
<p>谷氏最後報告他這次之所以大刀闊斧不顧一切地調整縣級機構的旨趣說：過去常有不盡職守的縣長和縣級人員，對於地方行政總是敷衍塞責，要不然就以待遇太薄，不够溫飽來作為貪汚舞幣玩法凟職的藉口。他說此種惡劣風氣一天不鏟除，地方庶政便一天不得進步。至於縣級機構的設置，過去多係一些不知下情的人，每於中央或省因一時需要設立機構興辦一事，仙要縣也設一機構來辦理這件事，日子一久，縣級機構重疊累贅，確屬實情，倘不加切實調整，當然不能使誠心想作點事的有為之士，得到推行盡利的方便。谷氏希望他全省的各縣縣長及縣級人員，今後在此調整方案寶行之日起，務須振作精神，認眞從事，同時，縣級人員更應廉潔自守。</p>

<h3>贛省舉辦　征屬授田</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　劉藻</p>
<p>〔本報南昌十日航訊〕江西省政府為了增進丘役行政與設法維持出征剿匪軍人家屬，特擬訂荒田授與出征剿匪軍人家屬及代耕辦法·該辦法中規定享受與授田的對象，是依照征兵程序征集之新丘蒙屬為準，並以縣（市）政府交兵名册為其家屬配授荒田的依據，如自動投入部隊服務者，則憑其服務部隊（軍師部或獨立旅團部）塡發之直接參與作戰士兵證明書予以比照配授。</p>
<p>田地配授的標準，據原辦法第四條規定：按征屬直系親屬如祖父母，父母，配偶子女弟（未滿十八歲者）每人配授以不超過五畝為原則，如其本身原有自耕田者，應按數减成配授，以足維持最低生活為準。</p>
<p>各縣（市）配授給軍人家屬的田地，係儘光將縣境以內可資耕種的荒地荒山，分由鄉鎭保甲，翔實調查，如係私有，由政府收買歸公，按照當地現有征屬戶口人數，平均分配，並應控制一部份，以備繼續配授，各縣（市）之田地不足配授時，在原辦法第六條有如下的規定：應詳查當地富戶所有田地之數量，按所需配授之田數，勸其讓出一部，由政府依法價購，以資配授出征家屬</p>
<p>由政府配授給征屬的田地，當地政府應發給配授執照，交征屬收執，並於配授日起，豁免五年的田糧賦稅，及其他一切的附稅，俟屆滿之後，由政府將配授執照收回，至換正式管業證（依照一般規定辦理），這算是田地的所有權，完全歸征屬掌有，所以一般的征收賦稅亦比照慣例負祖，但是，征屬對政府配授的田地，如因人力不敷耕作時，原辦法第七條後段規定：應以保為單位組織代耕隊保長為隊長，甲長為班長，凡屬保內年滿十八歲至屆滿四十五歲之男子，（征屬除外）均編為隊員有銀行代替本保征屬田地耕種（包括農事上所有一切工作之勞作）之義務。</p>
<p>代耕隊由保長任隊長，負責指揮，代替本保征屬耕作，隊員中如有不能從事耕作時得出資僱工代替，但不得以老稚或不堪服勞役者代替，並且在第十條辦法中規定，代耕隊不得接受征屬之任何報酬，或招待，惟征屬如有自動願意設備茶水者例外。關於征屬耕種所需的工具肥料與種籽，如資力不敷時，應由當地保長酌費與資金或代購置，俟秋收後無息歸還，如缺乏耕牛時照原辦法第十一條的規定，應由保長向保內有耕牛之家平允借用。</p>
<p>但是，征屬如觸犯動員時期軍人及其家屬優待條例第四章（除第十四條第三款者外）各條款規定之一者，原辦法第十四條明白的規定，應將其配援之田地，完全收回，並按情節之輕重追繳其已得之利益，撥充征屬優待金。</p>

<h3>金圓金鈔比率改訂　一般物價均下跌　白粳六百成交食米來源增加</h3>
<p>行政院政務會議通過金圓券與黃金外幣新比率後，各種物價均見平定。昨日因總理誕辰休假，各業無市，故無正式行情，但塲外做開價亦虛軟。米價因單帮運滬日多，一部份米號亦有米供應，米荒情形已好轉，白粳喊六百元一石，單帮已肯出售，同時糧食緊急購儲會所採購之食米，正分電催運，均在途中，亦將陸續到滬，故米荒問題已可漸獲解決。</p>
<h3>准許銀元流通　金融界態度一斑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自前日政院臨時會議決定，准許銀元自由流通，調整金銀官價，及有條件允許以金圓券兌換硬幣後，此間金融界人士，對其穩定幣値之可能性，咸抱保留態度。渠等認為如申央銀行能按規定收兌金銀比率，兌出金圓及銀元，並能大量供應，使此規硬幣能流通市面，則於幣信之提高，自有貢獻。</p>
<p>同時新辦法中以金圓券兌換金圓之規定，在目前銀根奇緊之情形下，是否能收進大量金圓劵，恐亦難有把握云。</p>
<h3>恢復市場自由買賣　物價當可逐漸降低</h3>
<p>當局依據經濟補充辦法，規定實施「議價」及「核本定價」後，所有物價曾一度形成混亂局面。其主要原因，乃為糧食開放自申買買後，食米價格狂漲，致各種物價亦跟隨提高，因而各業交易亦無法根據議價。其中例如以一般工業成品而言，廠盤議價僅高於「八一九」限價數倍，而市面上售價超出十餘倍以上，如此不正常狀態，對「議價」一節，有若具文而不發生效力。其他工業成品「核本定價」，在廠方所受損失當更鉅大。據一般工界意見，在目前形勢下，所謂「議價」「核本定價」似均多此一舉，現時政府如能解決糧食調節，及原料供應等問題，在穩定經濟原則下，一律恢復自由市塲交易，則各種物價自可逐漸降低，而工業成本品生產，亦可趨於正常。</p>
<h3>造幣廠將展開工作　加鑄金銀本位幣　韋廠長飛京謁徐財長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政院臨時會議通過修正金圓券發行辦法，決定在金圓券之外，同時發行以金銀鑄造之金圓後，中央造幣廠此後之造幣工作，除現鑄之輔幣外，將大量加鑄金銀本位幣，以供流通之需。</p>
<p>茲悉：該廠韋廠長，業於昨晨乘機飛京，據吿：此行重要任務，係晋謁新任財長徐堪。惟一般推測，當與請示開鑄新幣之事有關。</p>
<p>據韋氏稱：該廠在未奉新指令前，開鑄之輔幣，仍僅限於一分銅幣及五角銀幣二種云。</p>
<p>五角銀將先發行</p>
<p>又訊：金圓券發行辦法修正，決定開鑄金圓，中央造幣廠已準備開始鑄造新金銀硬幣，一俟財部金圓新模型及正式命令到達，卽可開工鑄造，因該廠鑄造硬幣，設備齊全，隨時可以開鑄。至於該廠所籌造之五角銀幣，已鑄有相當數額，如該項銀輔幣仍可發行，則日內當可先金硬幣而發行。</p>

<h3>米市</h3>
<p>— 莘人</p>
<p>這幾天，米行老闆們的臉上，又露出得意的微笑了·一淸早，大家都擠軋在市梢口，守住着侮一隻進口的農船，只要發現上面有五斗或一石的，準會得這個招手喊：「來啊，糶給我，包你不會責輸！」那個拍着腿，乾急着：「怎麼樣，阿春叔，不認得人了嗎？」即使有些自知之明的，在接不到主顧時，也會做着手勢，表示米價已大跳特跳；更有的，會輪着手指，把價開得駭人聽聞的。</p>
<p>米舖子裏的人們，幾乎全體出動，男的女的，川流不息，他們的眼光，却放在肩挑的農人身上，只要有一袋白米出現，便會有好多隻手，同時摸到這上面，於是「老主顧，糶給我！」一片聲嚷着，把鄉人們擁得手足無措了。結果，自然伶俐的佔了先，搶起袋子，便默默地走向舖子去了。</p>
<p>從火車中，跳下了短打的主顧，一批又一批的，彷彿是嗅逐米子的蝗虫。他們把白的倒空了，又開始要買進糙的。老闆們一轉手，二十元的白米，便三十元倒進了他們的袋子。憑你怎樣要價，只要一脫了手，隔一宿醒來，準會得連糙的都補不進。</p>
<p>今天的情况又有點不同了，因為隔夜到了七八十短打主顧，一淸早也擠在米老闆中間，直接跟農人們打交道了。白米一斗斗的接收去，米價頓時由三十，四十，五十猛跳起來。老闆們的喊聲，似乎已不及客路人靈騐了。</p>
<p>於是有人在為本地人的生活着想了。「這樣攬下去，窮人怎麽好活命！」便動手把他們趕攔釗馬路東面去。但是，那邊也有鄉人背米上市的，他們便簇擁着，懇求說：「謝謝你，把你的米糶給我！」鄉人們自然也看得出「苗頭」的，把價開得老老高，但脫了手，跑進市裏，才知自己已吃了虧。</p>
<p>所有的人們，似乎全都為了米，在着了瘋，表演出一幕幕的悲喜劇。（寄自正儀）</p>
<h3>天平舊游</h3>
<p>— 細侯</p>
<p>天平山蘇州人又呌它「范墳山」，說有宋朝「范文正公」的墳在，後來才知道是范希文的先塋之誤。還說是一夜天風吹得山石矗立，至今山頭上尙留有「萬笏朝天」四字。那樣幽邃隱秀的好去處，因范家出了個把人物，便造作得那麽富貴偪人，氣勢薰大，眞使我有點恨這位「窮寨主」，雖說與他無關，而且他寫的詞又很可愛。不過我七上天平，從沒有想到繞近范墳去看看，總是一直上山。</p>
<p>向天平去的路，大致分兩泌，一由木凟，一出楓橋，從前者去的居多。我初游是一個冷天，水淺舟遲，自胥門外向楓橋這而去，離山還遠就上岸跑步，越過「潼梓鬥」登山。道條水路祗走過一次，好像太寂寞了。從木凟去就翻過靈巖後山，穿村傍舍，迎着大平正面行進。有一次，自木凟至天乎，再越「潼梓門」尋路向楓橋入城，那就比較走得吃力。下一次，更反其道而行，從楓橋步行登山，繞至木凟搭船回。大抵玩山步行可以多收樓些，五步一景，卡步一勝，沿途領略，亦足償勞。</p>
<p>記得最酬暢的一次是結隊山行。踏過古老的楓橋，循着人字形的「御通」，先至觀音山，跨過大池山，花山，直登天平極頂。天池以石峯勝，雄奇瑰偉，而窮僻少有人至。相傳明人徐元歎的落木庵就在天池山，卽錢牧齊詩中的「江東留得一徐彼」。座址已無尋處，前閱梁某的落葉詩有一聯：「荒庵漸老徐元歎，濁酒相於崔不離」。下句運用「黃葉聲多酒不辭」的「崔黃葉」詩話，俱稱佳妙。附記於此。</p>
<p>天平石筍林立，積鐵森然，有的又枕藉縱橫，天然位置。在蘇州東南諸山中，天平特異獨立，百看不厭。山腰藏一寺，終日滴着「缽盂泉」水，內有「兼山閣」，倚閣聽楓，渾忘世慮。春夏之交，坐「一綫天」下，時聞山中「烏春」呌，脆響穿林，饒有石韻。再上為「中白雲」，大石橫出盈丈，古苔皴駁，俛臥石上，下視楓林，紅葉潮湧，蒼鷹掠過，手觸其背。最高處則為「上白雲」，環望遠山起伏，太湖浩淼，蒼茫獨立，興盡悲來。山中數數往還，不獨寺僧識面，山烏迎人；據石尋吟，亦嘗憶坡公「已覺來多釣石溫」之句。</p>
<p>天平紅葉已成為秋遊者的目標。可是天平的丹楓都是千百年物，矗立平谷，巨可合抱，老幹枚椏，大葉紛披，經霜脫落，燦若雲霞。不比籬落間一樹雞楓，粧點成冷艷小景。</p>
<p>不到天平，已十二年，每一憶及，便覺苔石霜林，湧現眼底。前幾天孩子們說將遠足天平去，我還囑咐他們不要忘了拾幾片紅葉回來。</p>
<h3>海紅樓詞</h3>
<p>— 半夢</p>
<p>浣溪紗</p>
<p>瘦馬西風踏古原，荒鴟老屋呌秋烟，拍橋流水泊歸船。寂寞黃昏常獨自，畫欄　處惜殘年，濁醪凉　問蒼天。</p>
<p>釣船笛</p>
<p>白眼對江天，幾片碎震空闊，一棹沙洲漁父，釣黃蘆寒月。好風吹送半星愁，一點自明滅。携得錦鱗沾酒，弄梅花長笛。</p>
<p>虞美人</p>
<p>秋來春去何時了？一任年華老。悲歡離合總成空，却信古今興廢一般同。天涯奮事休重省！沒底安排定·萬千心緒鎖眉頭，只恐落花身世减風流。</p>
<h3>清查戶口</h3>
<p>— 曉影</p>
<p>這次本市實行户口總淸查，動員了四萬餘的高中以上學生參加工作。筆者也蒙校中訓育處提名當選，被派在常熟區徐家匯路的某保某甲，做了一夜的「公務人員」。</p>
<p>說也可憐，上面發下的三圓津貼費，當夜配兩節乾电池就用去四圓，夜點心和車錢就只能掏自已的腰包了。</p>
<p>我淸查的那甲，却又多所謂「聞人」之流。行前蒙保長先生再三叮囑小心行事，「弦外之音」，自然「心照不宣」。</p>
<p>隨了甲長小姐開始執行「公務」。開始查的幾户是看弄巡捕，弄口小裁縫之流。踏進矮屋，椅茶立刻安放，如接待貴賓，招待周到，使我有些兒侷促不安。雖然是深秋之夜，在那溫暖的人情中，一些也感覺不到寒意，查畢出來，恭送如儀，可說一聲「賓主盡歡」。</p>
<p>接着要查的是那些「聞人」的府上了。保長之言猶在耳，倒覺戰戰兢兢起來，比做一個數學難題更覺傷腦筋。</p>
<p>「聞人」的府上的確是氣象不凡，依着保長先生所叮囑的「小心」行事，總算顺利過去。只是漸覺有些高處不勝寒。</p>
<p>有一位「聞人」的府上，也許好夢正酣，甲長小姐敲酸了她的王臂，才見有人出來開門，在客廳上等候了十餘分鐘，方才到齊，將新舊身份證及索引卡擲下。對我這位不及他身價百分之一的一介書生，愛睬不睬，愛理不理的，好像深怪我不該攪醒他們的好夢，那能度比西伯利亞的氣候更冷上十倍，幾乎將我的血液都凍住。倘不是那位甲長小姐的笑容可掬，溫和可親，我可眞想效學關羽的「掛印封金」而去。</p>
<p>轉而想到「聞人」們作事大多如此，這是他們的所謂架子，並非專門對我而發。阿Q在我心底復活。幸而這「精神安慰」，才使我心曠神怡，在回家時步子也輕鬆些。不然，也許要癱在半路上了。</p>
<h3>喜帖</h3>
<p>— 珊詩</p>
<p>前幾天，接到一個親戚的喜帖，說句老實話，看了這大紅的顏色，委實有些刺目，又要送禮了。</p>
<p>可惜這是中國的習俗，一時不易加以消減，事實上，舉辦一次婚禮，在當事人方面旣是勞民傷財，在賓客方面論，更是得不償失，女太太們又是非穿一襲簇新的衣服不肯赴宴的，試想這是多麼的浪費？</p>
<p>且說關於喜帖的事吧。</p>
<p>戰前，我在工部局立華童公學讀書的時候，一位老師舉行婚事，那位英國校長羅白先生也接到了一張喜帖，可是洋人不懂這是什麼玩意兒，就去请敎一位書記室的辦事員，也許是這位先生忠實於原文，他這樣翻譯：「請你全家的人都來參觀這個結婚典禮。」這一來可急得羅白校長大搔頭皮，說：「怎麼辦？我的太太在倫敦，孩子在美國讀書，我的女兒更無法通知，她跟了夫婿在比利時呢！」結果，他十分鄭重地寫了一封道歉的信給那位老師。這是「闔第光臨」鬧出來的笑話。</p>
<p>有一種喜帖也很特別，結婚的地點不在本市，還要為「恭請光臨」的話，我想很少會有客人從外埠趕來的吧！</p>
<p>還有一種是在報紙上登一則結婚啓事，除了年月日與地點，及恭請光臨以外，再有一句「恕不另柬」，然而事實上，到塲觀禮的人却十九都收到了喜帖。</p>

<h3>爭取時間</h3>
<p>— 談客</p>
<p>諺云：「一寸光陰一寸金」。又云：「時間卽金錢」。還有「未雨綢繆」。可見爭取時間的重要性。其說非今日始，而於今则更顯出其正確性。</p>
<p>據報載，兩路員工因提出緊急救濟未獲順利解決，乃全面怠工，兩路交通停頓五小時，而且北站秩序紊亂，沿綫多處失事。</p>
<p>員工的困難，當局決不會不明瞭，也決不能漢然置之。如果於發動请求之前，先給他們以相當的助力，使困難解除全部或一部份，那從人情上講，員工一定感到愉快，工作效率自必增高。及時的帮助最是收服人心之法。然而不此之圖，於「緊急救濟」的請求提出後尙想拖一拖再說，於是員工全面怠工，於是兩路交通停頓五小時，於是……</p>
<p>這只是我國當前許多事件中之一例，也正是國人漠視爭取時間的一個具體說明。你想：當人的理智給飢火控制以後，會做出什麽事來呢？彈壓會有澈底的效果嗎？怪實怪西又有什麽用呢？要緊的是正視事實，預為之謀，則大事可以化小，小事可以化無。</p>

<h3>Another Great Victory on the Outskirts of Xuzhou: Eastern Flank National Army Annihilates 37,000 Bandits; Chen Yi's Nine Columns Routed</h3>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Xuzhou Front Station, 1:30 PM, 12th] Military News: The bandit Chen Yi, with a force of more than nine columns, launched an offensive against the positions of Huang Baitao's army corps in Nianzhuang and Bayiji to the east of Xuzhou. From the evening of the 10th, fierce fighting continued until 5:00 AM this morning. The bandits employed human wave tactics, charging more than twenty times each night, but were ultimately bravely repulsed by our forces. In two days and nights, the bandits and our troops engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat, advancing and retreating without a moment's respite. More than ten thousand bandit corpses were left in front of our lines. By the afternoon of the 11th, our large air force formations, in coordination, heavily bombed the bandit artillery positions and fortifications, destroying 70 percent of them. The National Army then seized the opportunity to launch a brave and fierce attack. As of 5:00 AM this morning, more than 4,000 bandits had been disarmed by our forces. It has now been confirmed that the bandit's 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, New 8th, 9th, 11th, and 12th Columns, along with the Huaihai and Huaibei Independent Brigades, a total of over 160,000 men, have all participated in the fighting on this front. In the past three days of combat, the bandits have suffered more than 37,000 casualties, marking an unprecedented great victory in the Xuzhou campaign.</p>
<p>[Urgent Telegram from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2:00 PM, 12th] After our Huang Corps achieved a glorious victory this morning by completely routing the bandit forces of more than nine columns on the entire Nianzhuang and Bayiji line, the bandit momentum faltered, and although they attempted to attack again, their sharp edge was greatly diminished. Currently, our morale is high, and the people of Xuzhou are extremely excited. There will be even greater progress in the peripheral battles. The eight columns of bandits under the combined forces of Liu and Chen (Yi) on the western front, after suffering heavy blows on the Jieshan and Huangkou lines in recent days, have now avoided a frontal confrontation and dare not engage our main forces in a decisive battle. At present, in addition to the four columns of bandits gathering between Dangshan and Huangkou, Chen Yi's 3rd and Liangguang Columns are now scattered near Yongcheng, and Liu's 3rd and 9th Columns are now scattered near Linhuanji, southeast of Yongcheng, attempting to threaten the flanks and rear of the National Army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, our forces in the Suxian area are strong, and if the bandits attempt to attack from the flanks, they will inevitably suffer heavy blows. At the same time, the people of various counties in the Funiu Mountain area of western Henan and the local militias of Wanxi have also risen up in response. The former military region units of the bandits in the counties west and north of Nanyang, which were originally our local militias forcibly reorganized, have now jointly revolted, and by the 8th, the number of people had reached more than 7,000, creating a very large momentum. In the past two days, our local militias have launched widespread attacks, seizing 1,185 bandit rifles, 11 light machine guns, 3 heavy machine guns, 17,000 jin of grain, more than 700 sets of cotton uniforms, and a large quantity of other military supplies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced: A strong corps of the National Army advancing west of the Grand Canal has launched a counterattack against the bandits, recovering dozens of villages such as Wuzhuang and Qinjialou, and annihilating more than 5,000 men from Ye Fei's First Corps of bandits in the Qianhou Wuzhuang area northwest of Nianzhuang.</p>

<h3>Northeastern National Army All Arrives at Designated Locations; Defenses Between Tianjin and Yuzhou Further Consolidated; Unprecedentedly Strong Force; Jidong Absolutely Safe from Worry</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tangshan, 12th] After the end of the Northeast war, communist bandits have been entering the pass in a steady stream, and although their traces have been frequently reported, there has been no action. According to military authorities who spoke to reporters: The National Army that withdrew from the Northeast has arrived at its designated locations. Currently, large armies are gathered in Qinhuangdao and Yuguan, and strong troops have been added to the Tianjin-Yuzhou line. The force is stronger than ever before, so Jidong can be guaranteed to be safe from worry. Moreover, with the outbreak of the major battle in East China, the defense of Taiyuan, and the rumors of bandit harassment in Chahar and Suiyuan, the communist bandits' attempt to infiltrate Jidong is for the purpose of supplementing troop strength and provisions, and to use the route to reinforce another battlefield. As for launching a war in Jidong, it is feared that they currently do not have the strength.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 12th] Tianjin News reports: (1) In addition to some ships from Huludao being transferred to Qinhuangdao, the rest sailed directly to Shanghai.

(4) Telecommunications between Tianjin and Tangshan were temporarily disrupted yesterday but have been restored.</p>
<h3>The Current Serious Situation is Not a Crisis But an Opportunity; Fu Zuoyi's Speech at the Commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's Birthday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] At the Beiping Commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's 83rd Birthday, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi said in his speech: "Today is the 83rd anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday. When we commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we are truly filled with endless shame. We have been revolutionizing for decades, and to this day we have not been able to fully realize Sun Yat-sen's principles. The people's livelihood is declining, and the nation's destiny is in peril. Just thinking about this fills us with immeasurable emotion.</p>
<p>Everyone in North China now feels a serious threat. Due to the changes in the Northeast war situation, the enemies from the Northeast will be added to North China, increasing the pressure on North China. We must examine whether the military setbacks in the Northeast were defeats. We can only say that they were due to our own internal disorder, and they cannot prove that the communist bandits are formidable. Since the communist rebellion, our military setbacks and political failures are indeed facts, but they have all failed due to our own corruption and incompetence, which has allowed the communist bandits to gain temporary local advantages. The communist bandits were able to defeat corruption and incompetence because corruption and incompetence should fail. If someone fights, they will fail. If no one fights, they will also fail. However, the communist bandits' totalitarian terror and cruelty can never defeat our ideals of democracy, freedom, and peace. Under the current situation, looking forward to the future of North China, I believe that it is not so much a crisis as it is an opportunity. We currently have difficulties, but we have even greater confidence in overcoming these difficulties and getting through them. From countless painful and bloody facts, the people of North China have already raised their awareness. They have a truly deep understanding of the problem and know for sure that today's suppression of rebellion in China is not a simple ordinary civil war, not a struggle for political power, and even less should it be to protect the wealthy and privileged. Rather, it is a struggle between two different ways of life: the people's livelihood, freedom, and peace versus totalitarian terror and cruelty. Only with the success of the suppression of rebellion will the Chinese people have democracy and freedom, be able to enjoy the rights of citizens in an independent and autonomous country, be able to continue our good cultural traditions, ethical morality, harmonious family life, and freedom of religious belief. If the communist bandits rule China, the Chinese people will no longer have democracy or freedom. They will confine the Chinese people behind an iron curtain, plunging them into totalitarian tyranny, cruelty, terror, and endless war. The communist bandits have recently been promoting that they can stop liquidation and struggle in some places, expressing their so-called "lenient policy." However, the people of North China know the true situation in the bandit areas all too well. They will never forget the cruelty of the communist bandits' liquidation and struggle, and they can also see through the communist bandits' propaganda of stopping liquidation and struggle as a poisonous trick and a deception. The communist bandits' own history is the best proof. The communist bandits' background and the set of strategies they have inherited and learned are enough to show that the communist bandits' so-called "lenient policy" is only a short-term exploitation and means. The longer the communist bandits have ruled a place, the deeper the people's suffering, the greater their hatred of the bandits, and the more thoroughly they know the true face of the communist bandits. Correct understanding will become powerful action. The more serious the situation, the more concentrated the will of the people of North China. The more arduous the task, the stronger our strength.</p>
<p>I dare to say that the vast majority of the National Army in North China is not corrupt. They all have a purpose, an ideal, and are sacrificing and struggling for the principles and for the people. They have no demands for themselves. Precisely because of this, they eat the coarsest food, wear the worst clothes, walk the most difficult roads, and fight the most intense battles. They are never despondent, never disappointed. The various units are full of a spirit of coordination, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and they can often automatically support and fulfill the requirements of the common whole. In the recent Northeast campaign, if the friendly forces had been able to support each other according to plan, it would not only not have been a defeat, but it would have been a great victory. We can say with certainty that officers who are for enjoyment and for themselves will inevitably fail, while armies that are for principles, for the people, and have a purpose and an ideal will inevitably succeed and win."

<h3>Nationwide Expanded Troop Morale Boosting; Comfort Association and Relevant Agencies Launch; Also Sends Telegrams of Condolence to Frontline Army and Air Force Soldiers in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Xuzhou campaign is unfolding fiercely, and our army and air force are bravely killing the enemy, with frequent great victories.

This time, they are scrambling to harass Xuzhou. Fortunately, the generals have met them head-on with a severe blow, and good news is frequently reported. We are about to encircle and annihilate them, achieving the effect of sweeping them away in one fell swoop, eradicating the red threat, and restoring the people to a safe haven. We eagerly await your banners and sing your praises. The people of the whole country pledge to be your support. In addition to collecting a large number of comfort items and organizing comfort groups to depart for the front lines as soon as possible, we would like to send our condolences in advance. Respectfully, the National Association for Comforting Soldiers Suppressing the Rebellion. (Printed on the 12th) The association also believes that the defense of Taiyuan has lasted for more than two months, and the loyal and courageous national army, under the leadership of Director Yan, has repeatedly defeated the bandit forces.

<h3>The Executive Yuan Convenes a Meeting of Provincial Governors and Mayors; Conference to be Held Today in Nanjing; Discussions on Total War and Dredging Grain Sources</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The National Grain Conference convened by the Executive Yuan was originally scheduled to open on the morning of the 12th.

Attendees will include the chairmen, mayors, speakers, and relevant ministries and departments of the provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Fujian, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan.

<h3>After Restoring the Circulation of Coins</h3>
<p>The recent panic over the shortage of materials, especially rice, firewood, and miscellaneous grains, is, as everyone knows, due to the arbitrary obstruction by various localities and the unwillingness of farmers to sell. Regarding the former, it can be easily eliminated as long as the central government issues a clear order and enforces the law strictly. Regarding the latter, it will not be effective unless efforts are made to restore confidence in the currency. Because currency originally has two functions: one is a measure of exchange, and the other is a store of value. During this period of inflation and drastic price fluctuations, these two functions have almost completely failed. No wonder the concept of "valuing goods over currency" has become more deeply rooted in people's minds.</p>
<p>The authorities shy away from admitting the failure of the issuance policy. In the past, they often shifted all responsibility to speculative merchants, believing that soaring prices and material shortages were entirely the result of their actions. It was not until farmers in various places retained their products and refused to sell, creating the current widespread food shortage, that they were willing to frankly admit their mistakes and take effective remedial measures on the currency issue itself.</p>
<p>Preparing to mint and issue coins and allowing the circulation of silver dollars are effective remedial measures determined by Finance Minister Xu after taking office. Regardless of whether restoring coins or even restoring silver dollars is a step backward in the currency system, at a time when the credit of paper money has obviously been shaken, this measure is undoubtedly a targeted remedy. Because this is a hard currency, which itself has a fairly high intrinsic value, and is different from the over-issued paper money. Although the legal tender has been in circulation for more than ten years, the general public has not completely lost faith in it. Before the Gold Yuan Notes were introduced, many places in the interior still used it as a medium of exchange, and even collected it sporadically as a means of preserving surplus purchasing power. Therefore, allowing silver dollars to circulate as one of the legal currencies is not only catering to people's preferences and changing their concept of "valuing goods over currency," but also indirectly increasing the value of the Gold Yuan Notes by determining a ratio between silver dollars and Gold Yuan Notes of one to ten, thereby stabilizing prices in the current extremely chaotic situation. As for the waste utilization of this part of coins and raw gold and silver, and the exemption of countless holders from legal penalties, those are all secondary matters.</p>
<p>The difficulties are: (1) According to the principle of good currency driving out bad currency, once these coins are put into public circulation, they may be snapped up for collection, and the desired effect may not be achieved. The recent rush to exchange one-cent copper coins, making them difficult to circulate, is a case in point. (2) When the legal tender was promoted in 1935, most of the silver coins in various places had already been recovered and shipped abroad. Moreover, another batch was re-collected and exchanged before the period from "August 19th" to the end of October. The amount of silver hidden among the people is probably very small. (3) Although it has now been decided to mint gold and silver coins ranging from one to one hundred yuan, the replenishment of raw materials for the new coins and the procedures for starting factories and minting coins are not very simple matters. Therefore, to restore confidence in the currency and make everyone happy to accept it, allowing materials to circulate as usual, the key still lies in the real control of the amount of issuance and the prompt permission to exchange for gold and silver.</p>
<p>It is said that the total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency collected after "August 19th" reached about US$200 million. According to the newly revised exchange rate, the value of the Gold Yuan Notes has been devalued four times in disguise. In that case, it would not be difficult to recover all the Gold Yuan Notes that have already been issued by using only one-half of this amount. Therefore, before the Gold Yuan Notes are minted, if a method can be determined to quickly allow the exchange for gold or silver coins, without making a rigid requirement of redeeming at the same amount after one year of deposit, then the Gold Yuan Notes can be quickly withdrawn from circulation, and their value can be increased immediately. As a result, the exchange of materials and the level of wages can be easily readjusted in the short term. The exchange conditions attached this time, such as redeeming at the same amount after one year of deposit, may have a certain significance in absorbing currency and preventing the outflow of funds, but from the perspective of Gold Yuan Note holders, it is still somewhat unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>As for the total amount of Gold Yuan Notes to be issued, this time it is not rigidly stipulated, but changed to "determined by order separately." The only way to control it is that the supervisory committee for the issuance reserve can notify the Central Bank to stop issuing if it discovers that the reserve is insufficient. Therefore, we believe that the organization of this supervisory committee should be composed of representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and national financial, industrial, and commercial organizations to supervise and demonstrate public trust. Fortunately, the organizational regulations of the committee are still to be drafted by the Executive Yuan. We sincerely hope that the authorities will adopt this suggestion to satisfy public expectations.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Weng cabinet, this is the third major economic reform. After experiencing great pain, the people generally have an urgent desire for stability. Because every reform inevitably causes disturbance and loss, and the widespread material shortage that has recently occurred in various places has caused the general public, whether rich or poor, to suffer equally in their lives, and they are all filled with anxiety. Now that the government has realized the failure of its past monetary policy, it has restored coins and taken out physical objects to restore confidence in the currency. It can naturally have a stabilizing effect on the current soaring prices, especially in today's tight money market, it is more likely to have the effect of suppressing prices. However, the government must have great determination in issuing coins and must achieve the prerequisite of no longer issuing Gold Yuan Notes. We believe that only under the condition of no longer issuing Gold Yuan Notes can the minting and issuing of gold and silver coins have the effect of contracting currency and suppressing prices. Conversely, if gold and silver coins are minted and issued while the currency continues to inflate, and Gold Yuan Notes and coins are circulating in the market at the same time, the phenomenon of "bad money driving out good money" will inevitably occur. The currency circulating in the market will still be Gold Yuan Notes, and it will naturally not have a stabilizing effect on prices.</p>
<h3>Good Response After the Revision of the Gold Yuan Note Measures; Prices Fall; Victory Reported from Xuzhou; People's Morale Boosted in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] After the revised measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes and the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people were announced, the response in the capital's market on the 12th was extremely positive. Especially since the temporary martial law began on the 11th, rumors have subsided, order has been stabilized, and the empty shelves and store closures during the period of price limits and panic buying have completely become a thing of the past. On the morning of the 12th, 19 out of 10 stores opened for business, and inventories that had not been seen for many days emerged one after another, as did rice and food. Commodity prices generally fell across the board. The price of food rice fell relatively less due to rice source relations, while the decline in Wuyang Department Store was the most significant, reaching about 30%. Some stores even advertised with a 10% discount. The supply of vegetables and meat in the vegetable market exceeded demand, so many reduced prices to seek sales. In addition, since the 12th was the birthday of the National Father and banks were closed, the money market was extremely tight and cash was very scarce, which was also the main reason for the price drop. Silver coin transactions reappeared on the streets. Silver coins, which had reached more than 30 yuan on the black market two days ago, had fallen to around 20 yuan on the morning of the 12th, with many transactions being made at around 18 yuan, but there were few buyers. The black market for gold and foreign currency was also said to have fallen significantly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] The response in Hangzhou was good after the supplementary measures for currency reform were announced. Rice has fallen nearly 300 due to the abundance of sources, and vegetables have generally fallen by 20%. Meat prices are still as high as 16 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 12th] Rice and grain rose and then fell, then turned firm again, as did soybean oil. Other items all fell.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 12th] Victory was reported again from the Battle of Xuzhou, and people's morale was more stable. Commodity prices continued to decline, with rice at 280 yuan per picul and 20-count Hongkui cotton yarn at 6,800 yuan. Daily necessities also fell slightly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 12th] Southern Anhui has been peaceful in recent days, and the Yangtze River defense has also been consolidated.

The first batch of rice was purchased with a loan from the Central Bank, providing 3,000 piculs of rice.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] After the revised measures for the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes were announced, commodity prices here have all trended downward, and goods that had been hidden have also emerged one after another.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 12th] The citizens of Xi'an responded very well to the government's announced measures for the issuance of coins. Prices of various goods generally fell by 20%, and yarn and cigarettes were no exception.</p>

The market was stable, but according to financial circles, the current Gold Yuan and U.S. dollar ratio has increased by 3 yuan based on the current market price, and commodity prices may be affected by this.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 12th] On the 12th, prices in Chengdu rose due to the increase in the price of gold and silver. The money market was tight and transactions were deserted.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Fu Zuoyi's Speech Continued from Page One</h3>
<p>I just said that China's current suppression of bandits and rebellion is a struggle between two different ways of life. We are defending national independence and dignity, striving for political democracy, economic equality, and freedom of life, realizing the lofty political ideal of the Three Principles of the People, and fighting for world peace, for freedom and democracy, and for the Chinese people's genuine peace and universal stability of life. Therefore, the meaning of suppressing bandits and rebellion today is not passive, but active; not conservative, but revolutionary. This is the essence of the war to suppress bandits and rebellion, and it is also the source of our strength. If we do not want to be slaves locked in an iron curtain, and choose the democratic, free, and peaceful way of life, we should add our strength to the camp of suppressing bandits and rebellion, because strength belongs to everyone, not to one person. We must strive for our own wishes, and only our own strength is the most reliable. The strength of the National Army in North China is strong, and with the united support of the people, it will surely achieve the people's wishes and complete the task of suppressing bandits and rebellion.</p>
<p>At present, we must universally and thoroughly carry out the work of a total war with close military, political, economic, and cultural coordination, focusing on the following points: (1) Thoroughly eradicate bandits and eliminate traitors, stabilize the internal situation, and consolidate the rear. Use the power of the people to eliminate the hidden elements of bandits and traitors who create rumors, stir up trouble, and conspire to sabotage. (2) Give full play to strong combat effectiveness, high morale, and pure skills to annihilate the enemy. (3) Economic interests should be consistent with the interests of the people, work should be linked to life, and rights should be linked to obligations, especially to protect the lives of the hard-working compatriots. (4) Anti-corruption and anti-degradation, to ensure political integrity and competence. (5) Break down private factional grievances. All personnel and all departments should actively cooperate with the work, and turn all forces into combat forces. (6) Unite the power of the people, and cooperate closely between the military, government, and people to strive for victory.</p>
<p>The seriousness of the current situation is so serious that we must catch up quickly and exert our greatest strength, so that we can create the greatest achievements. It is not so serious that we cannot do anything. The serious situation today is not a crisis, but an opportunity, a chance for survival. We must strengthen our confidence, make up our minds, use the power of unity, the unified will, and courageous action to enhance our strength and expand our strength. All wisdom should be used to suppress bandits, and all strength should be used on the front lines. Hard work will inevitably lead to success. Victory is not to be waited for. All thoughts of retreat are a dead end. The people of North China should unite and rise up together. The future is infinitely bright and full of hope.</p>
<p>Suppressing bandits and rebellion is to save the Chinese people from their current suffering and create genuine peace and lasting happiness. It is not for the sake of one person or one part of the people. As far as I, Fu Zuoyi, am concerned, I have no property to protect, and I am not fighting to maintain my official position, let alone for personal enjoyment. If you say that I am for enjoyment, I believe everyone knows what I have enjoyed. It can be said that there is only sacrifice, but I am very determined and hardworking. This determination and hard work is based on my belief in the doctrine, my understanding of the times, and my pursuit of ideals, and comes entirely from my sincerity to the country and the people. For the sake of the country and the people, I am willing to sacrifice myself. I also believe that our military and government cadres and all our comrades-in-arms share the same understanding as I do. It is not for a position or a few dollars, but to have ideals, understanding, ambitions, and aspirations, to be loyal to the revolution, and to serve the people. Everyone can come and see the lives of our military commanders at any time without prior notice. Although they are suffering, they never know what depression is, never become negative, and work very hard.</p>
<p>There is only one truth: the war to suppress bandits and rebellion to save the country, save the people, and save ourselves will surely be victorious. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we believed that the 20th century was an era of national rejuvenation. No matter how strong Japan was, the War of Resistance would eventually succeed. Today, we are also convinced that democracy and freedom will surely defeat totalitarian terror. Although hardship is inevitable, as long as we are determined and prepared to face difficulties, the people of North China are rich in the spirit of perseverance and courage. Everyone should unite, and I, Zuoyi, am willing to follow the people of North China, under the leadership of President Chiang, and under the will of the people, to work hard and struggle to realize our aspirations. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Political Committee Debates Disarmament Issues; The United States Refutes Soviet Accusations; Announces that Soviet Military Strength is Five Times Greater Than That of the West</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] U.S. Representative Osborn stated in the Political Committee of the United Nations today that Soviet military strength is enormous. Reportedly, the Soviet Union has 4 million troops, and the countries under Soviet control have another 2.8 million troops. The total of the two is 250 divisions of common combat forces, which is equal to five times the total amount of troops of Western countries. Since the end of World War II, the Soviet Union has not helped to promote international trust. For example, the Berlin issue directly rejected the mediation plan of six neutral countries. Osborn finally expressed support for the proposal made by Belgium.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] U.S. Representative Osborn also accused the Soviet Union of attempting to create a world revolution. He said that the Soviet Union is fully armed and is attempting to overthrow the remaining representative governments throughout the world. The Soviet Union is capable of launching an aggressive war to continue attacking other countries. The Soviet Union is using most of its manpower and resources for war preparations, which is different from Western countries. The Soviet Union is the only country that launches propaganda institutions under government control to urge people to prepare for war. Osborn's speech came as the Political Committee of the United Nations debated the Soviet proposal for the five powers to disarm by one-third within a year. His remarks were also a response to Soviet Representative Vyshinsky's lengthy speech on the 11th, condemning the United States for planning an aggressive war.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 12th] The Political Committee will consider two proposals in the current disarmament debate: one is the Soviet proposal to reduce armaments and ban atomic bombs, and the other is the Belgian proposal supported by Western countries, which advocates that the Regular Armaments Committee put forward a plan to reorganize international control.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Re-evaluate Its Policy Toward the Soviet Union; Secretary Marshall Meets With Forrestal and Smith Separately in Paris; The United States and Canada Will Hold Talks on a Security Alliance Next Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th, Associated Press] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Secretary of Defense Forrestal began consultations here today. Well-informed sources said that this move may be a precursor to the United States re-evaluating its policy toward the Soviet Union. The sources said that reviewing U.S.-Soviet relations is one of the main tasks after Truman's election. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith is expected to arrive here from Moscow on Friday or Saturday to participate in this review. However, Forrestal will likely leave before Smith's arrival, and Marshall will synthesize the opinions of the two.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that Forrestal's mission is to bring the latest views on the Cold War plan in Washington to Secretary Marshall, while Smith will report on Moscow's reaction after Truman's election to Marshall. Marshall, Forrestal, and other U.S. officials here also discussed the proposed North Atlantic defense agreement.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] After arriving here, U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal held three consecutive talks with Secretary of State Marshall. Forrestal also had lengthy conversations with Harriman, the European director of the Marshall Plan, Caffery, the U.S. Ambassador to France, and Ramadier, the French Minister of Defense. U.S. officials here said that Forrestal's talks were a comprehensive survey of military and diplomatic issues around the world. They did not express whether the Atlantic alliance was one of the topics discussed.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Canada, 11th] According to authoritative sources, the United States and Canada will hold talks next week to decide on coordinating military industries and exchanging military equipment within the scope of the future collective security alliance.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Visits the Netherlands and Then Proceeds to Brussels</h3>

<h3>The Soviet Peace Offensive; The West Will Not Be Fooled</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 12th] A major representative to the United Nations General Assembly said today that the rumors about a meeting between Truman and Stalin are a Soviet propaganda peace offensive. The Soviet Union is clearly uneasy about the unified front of major powers in the United Nations General Assembly, so it wants to use this offensive to weaken the position of Western countries.</p>
<h3>French President's Speech Reaffirms Policy Toward Germany</h3>
<p>Insists on International Co-Management of the Ruhr</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] On the anniversary of the armistice of World War I, French President Auriol delivered a speech stating, "We must win peace. We must not forget the mistakes after World War I that led to the second disaster. We must never repeat them. All of Europe has been deeply ravaged by Germany in spirit and material. It would be unfair if Germany escapes the obligation to compensate and there is no definite guarantee of control over Germany's re-aggression." President Auriol emphasized that Germany's heavy industrial zone must be under international control. He said, "We insist that we will never allow any economic measures that disregard experience, principle, and prudence to exist. Germany should contribute to the reconstruction of Europe, but we cannot allow the armaments factories in the Ruhr to return to the hands of Hitler's followers or Germans who will threaten world peace in the future. The Ruhr should be internationally owned and co-managed internationally. This is the only way to guarantee the security of Europe and the German people themselves."</p>
<h3>Millions of German Workers Launch a One-Day General Strike</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Frankfurt, 12th] Millions of German workers launched the largest 24-hour general strike in postwar Germany on the 12th, following orders from the trade union, to protest the high cost of living. Boerner, the head of the trade union in the British occupation zone, estimated that 8 million people had gone on strike, including 3 million non-union members, who could not go to work due to traffic disruptions. The initial order was quite good.</p>
<h3>The American People's Aversion to War Led to the Rejection of Dewey</h3>
<p>A Soviet Literary Newspaper Comments on the U.S. Election</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th, Associated Press] The Literary Gazette stated that the American people represent peace and democracy, and oppose war-mongers and the tyranny of capitalism. The newspaper explained the results of the U.S. election and said that the facts show us that the results are not because the people are more fond of Truman, but because the people are electing the "lesser of two evils." "Truman is better than Dewey, a disguised reactionary, because Dewey has obvious fascist ideas and is one of the unforgivable warmongers."</p>

<h3>Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Armistice; A Chorus of Prayers for Peace; French Veterans Demonstrate and Clash With the Military Police</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] The 11th is the anniversary of the armistice of World War I. The world celebrated amid turmoil, praying for a lasting peace that two world wars had failed to achieve. The United States, Britain, France, and other countries paid tribute to their fallen soldiers with solemn ceremonies. The sound of prayers for peace could be heard everywhere in the United States, but there were also speeches implying the need to be prepared for the worst. The traditional center of Armistice Day in the United States is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery near Washington. President Truman's military aide placed a wreath on the white marble tomb at 11:00 a.m. today, the time when World War I ended thirty years ago. Dozens of other wreaths and various flowers were placed on the tombs of the fallen soldiers in World War II.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chaillot Palace, 11th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie delivered a speech here today commemorating the 30th anniversary of the armistice of World War I, praising the brave men and women who sacrificed themselves for world peace in that war. Lie said, "We hope that those who still remain today will continue to strive for peace." Emphasizing the difficulties faced by the United Nations, Lie said that the United Nations organization can save the world from another catastrophe. He also said, "A strong, effective, and sufficient United Nations to maintain peace and welfare is the best monument that mankind can build."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] France and North Africa solemnly held ceremonies today to commemorate the armistice of World War I. All churches held special services. Unfortunately, an incident occurred during the memorial parade in this city this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] Fierce fighting broke out here this afternoon during the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the armistice of World War I. It is said that one of the participants in the parade was injured by a police bullet, and several others were also injured at the same time. Dozens of people were arrested, which greatly dampened the celebration. The conflict arose because two to three thousand left-wing veterans disregarded the police's obstruction and instructions and marched towards the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. After being stopped by the police, it became a melee. The crowd attacked the police and police cars with stones, and the chaos gradually subsided by evening.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] After the clash between demonstrators and military police at the Place de la République today during the celebration of the anniversary of the armistice of World War I, representatives of the "Free Combatants" League and the Federation of Journalists affiliated to the General Confederation of Labor appealed to President Auriol, protesting against the measures taken by Interior Minister Moch. Representatives of the "Free Combatants" strongly argued that the police attempted to cut the parade into two sections, which led to the conflict. Representatives of the Federation of Journalists said that one journalist and one photographer covering the event were beaten and injured by the police. The representatives demanded that the Ministry of the Interior guarantee that such incidents would not happen again. The conflict area is currently calm.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 11th] Two veteran soldiers from Siam who participated in World War I will march today wearing their medals to commemorate Armistice Day. A banquet will be held in the gardens of the Grand Palace tonight. Veteran soldiers from China, Britain, France, and other Allied countries have been invited to attend. It is estimated that there were 1,400 Siamese soldiers who participated in World War I, some of whom served in French mechanical units. It is believed that only about 400 of them are still alive, and most of the rest died in France because they were born in the tropical climate of Siam and died from the cold.</p>

<h3>Chiang Ting-fu's Heated Debate with Vyshinsky: Accuses the Soviet Union of Interfering in China's Civil War and Driving Japanese POWs to Aid the Communists in Rebellion</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, November 11] Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu today criticized the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal in the UN Political Committee, asserting that it indirectly interfered in China's internal affairs. He further stated that Soviet policy was a factor in creating one of Asia's greatest anxieties and that the Soviet proposal to reduce the military strength of the five major powers by one-third would, in effect, weaken China's efforts to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, November 11] In discussions about disarmament, a problem that all diplomats unanimously considered destined to fail, Chiang Ting-fu clashed sharply with Soviet representative Vyshinsky. Chiang bluntly opposed the recent Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third. In declaring that China could not reduce its strength in the war against the Communists, he pointed out that the primary step the United Nations should take to achieve world peace should be "to disarm the fifth columns within China, Greece, and Korea, and the fifth columns throughout the world." Chiang Ting-fu accused the Soviet Union of using the 80,000 Japanese prisoners of war it obtained in World War II to assist the Chinese Communists, with 50,000 of them fighting in Manchuria and 30,000 serving as technical experts for the Communist Party. This was the most direct condemnation in a public debate of Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>In response, Vyshinsky declared that he doubted whether China's disarmament "would have any effect on the outcome of the great war between the 'people' of China and the Chinese army, a war which now shows the brilliant victory of the 'people.'" He accused China of being deeply afraid of disarmament because China needs "every tank, every shell, every soldier, and every firearm to cope with and deal with the 'people' of China." Chiang Ting-fu declared, "The distance between the words of the Soviet delegation here and the conduct of the Soviet government is as far as the north is from the south." Chiang further explained, "China is currently engaged in a serious civil war, just like the United States eighty-eight years ago and the Soviet Union in 1917. If anyone had proposed disarmament to Lincoln, Lincoln would certainly have considered it an unfriendly act. If the League of Nations had advised Lenin to disarm thirty years ago, Lenin would have laughed and denounced the proposal as malicious."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, November 11] Chiang Ting-fu's attack on the Soviet Union's use of Japanese prisoners of war provoked a fierce attack from Soviet representative Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky told the chairman of the committee, Mr. Spaak, that it was incomprehensible that the chairman would tolerate this "shameless attack on the Soviet Union." Vyshinsky emphasized that the chairman was unable to make the representatives express politeness, and said, "I can only come to one conclusion, that the Soviet representative must defend his own dignity and can no longer rely on the chairman to do the work." Spaak only asked the representatives to stop other incidents so that the matter could be brought to a close.</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative to the Far Eastern Commission Rejects Soviet Demands on Japan</h3>
<p>Japan has Already been Disarmed; The Soviet Union can Rest Assured</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, November 11] At today's regular meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, U.S. representative McCoy rejected Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin's request to intensify participation in the control of Japan with a stern tone. McCoy's main points were three: (1) Japan has already been thoroughly disarmed. The United States believes that Japan will not launch an aggression again, and the Soviet Union can rest assured. (2) The United States has repeatedly proposed the early restoration of Japan's peacetime economy, just as the Soviet Union hopes.</p>
<h3>Greek Cabinet Resigns Due to Internal Divisions within the Liberal Party; Tsaldaris is the Most Popular Candidate to Succeed as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, November 12] Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis finally fulfilled his long-held promise on the 12th, submitting the resignation of the entire cabinet. King Paul is expected to immediately begin searching for a new prime minister, with Foreign Minister Tsaldaris being the most popular candidate to succeed him, as Tsaldaris is the leader of the People's Party, the largest party in parliament. Sophoulis' resignation was caused by internal divisions within the Liberal Party, with Deputy Party Leader Venizelos automatically announcing on the 11th that he no longer had confidence in the government, which accelerated Sophoulis' departure. However, he had also repeatedly threatened to resign recently, and last expressed his intention to resign last weekend, but agreed to continue in office until the United Nations debate on the Greek issue concluded.</p>
<h3>Siamese Cabinet Reshuffle; Several Ministers to be Replaced</h3>
<p>Due to the Parliament and People's Criticism of the Government's Incompetence</p>
<p>[United Press International, Bangkok, November 11] Siamese Prime Minister Luang Phibunsongkhram announced today that the cabinet will be partially reshuffled, replacing several new ministers. The individual resignations of various ministers were triggered by criticism of the government's incompetence by parliament and the public. It is expected that the ministers of finance, commerce, interior, and transportation will all be replaced.</p>
<p>(3) The Soviet proposal that various countries involved control Japanese industry for several years would inevitably continue until after the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, which is beyond the authority of the Far Eastern Commission. After the establishment of the peace treaty, Japan should be subject to the control of the peace treaty, and the Far Eastern Commission no longer has the right to jurisdiction. McCoy finally stated that the Soviet proposal does not provide practical solutions. This committee already has a far-reaching policy for disarming Japan, which is being implemented by MacArthur. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has direct speaking rights in the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Control Council in Tokyo, so there is no need to change the direction. As for the so-called U.S. military rebuilding the Yokosuka naval port, that is not the case.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Announces Partial Reshuffle of the Korean Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, November 12] Korean President Syngman Rhee told the press today that after the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Korean issue, the Korean cabinet may undergo a partial reshuffle. The parliament recently requested the president to strengthen the cabinet lineup.</p>

<h3>The President Cares About Shanghai's Food Supply; Mayor Wu Proposes Two Suggestions; Returns to Shanghai the Same Evening and Expresses Optimism about the Future of Prices</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, November 12] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen was summoned to Beijing to attend the food conference. He arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. Because the food conference had been postponed to the 13th, Wu paid his respects to the President and President Weng in Beijing on the 12th, and returned to Shanghai on the night train on the 12th. Wu paid his respects to the President at 10:30 on the morning of the 12th, reporting on the situation in Shanghai. The President inquired in detail about the current price and food problems in Shanghai. Wu also put forward two suggestions regarding food: (1) Provinces should not prevent the transport of food out of the province. (2) Food should not be taxed. The President agreed with both suggestions. He then paid his respects to President Weng, making the same report and suggestions. According to Wu's remarks on the evening of the 12th, there is a comprehensive solution to the food problem in Shanghai. After the Hong Kong rice arrives in Shanghai, the insufficient amount of food rationing in October can be made up. In the future, American aid food will be shipped in steadily, and there is no need to worry about the food supply in Shanghai. In the past few days, the food supply in Shanghai has become normal, and food prices have been falling day by day. At this time, the government announced the revised method of issuing gold yuan notes, and people can hold gold, silver and foreign currencies. It is believed that both prices and food prices can be stable for a longer period of time in the future.</p>
<h3>Grand Gathering at the Cultural Hall Commemorates the National Day; More Than a Thousand Representatives from Various Agencies and Students Attended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, amid widespread price declines, all walks of life in the city commemorated the birthday of the founding father of the nation. All agencies, schools, and businesses followed the usual practice of taking a day off, and the markets were closed. Under the bright sunshine, national flags flew throughout the city. All public parks were open to the public free of charge. The citizens shook off the tension of the past few days and spent this holiday in a relaxed and cheerful mood. The Shanghai Municipality Celebration of the Founding Father's Birthday Commemoration Conference was held at 9:30 yesterday morning at the Cultural Hall on Zhapu Road. More than a thousand representatives from various agencies, citizens, and students attended.</p>
<p>Stabilize the Economy, Ensure Public Safety</p>
<p>The meeting was opened by Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang, who stated: "If there were no Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, there would be no Three Principles of the People, nor would there be the Republic of China. When we commemorate the birthday of the founding father of the nation today, we should always review how to commemorate the founding father of the nation and how to be a loyal follower of the founding father of the nation. China is now a democratic country. The Constitution stipulates that the Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People. All Chinese people should be loyal followers of the founding father of the nation. At a time when the country is in difficulty, we must remember that the founding father of the nation overcame all kinds of hardships to create the Republic of China, and we must constantly review the current difficult environment, cooperate with the evolution of military affairs and economy, and strengthen our efforts and vigilance." Fang then solemnly and firmly put forward three points: "(1) The Communist bandits are supported by red imperialism, seizing cities and territories, and endangering the people. We must understand that protecting the country and protecting our families is the responsibility of everyone, immediately arm ourselves, and strengthen our determination. (2) The Communist bandits are launching a rumor offensive in an attempt to disrupt the public's minds. They recently claimed that the city would cut off electricity and water. Facts have proven that this is absolutely not the case. We must always be vigilant and combat this conspiracy, and cooperate with the front-line military operations. If we discover underground Communist bandits who spread rumors and confuse the public, we should report them to the relevant authorities and severely punish them in accordance with martial law. (3) Maintaining economic stability and ensuring local security is the government's greatest determination. The phenomenon of economic turmoil during the past period of price limits is hoped not to be repeated. In the future, merchants must show conscience, only seek not to lose money, and must not seek excessive profits, hoarding and raising prices, which is tantamount to being a puppet for the bandits. The authorities will impose severe punishments."</p>
<p>Training Work, Rapid Development Followed by a speech by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, who, after exposing various Communist bandit conspiracies, stated: After the establishment of the Shanghai Self-Defense Force Headquarters, the training work in various districts will be rapidly launched from the 15th of this month, so that the citizens of the city can jointly participate in the sacred work of defending Shanghai. He also suggested that Chairman Fang should follow the late president's exhortation of "Consult with the multitude of talents and be the vanguard of the people" and take the lead in joining the self-defense force, arming all, and being a role model for the citizens. After the speech, everyone shouted slogans under the leadership of Chairman Fang, and movies were shown, and the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Celebration Conference of Party Departments at All Levels</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang and its affiliated party departments at all levels held a celebration conference in memory of the anniversary of the birth of the premier at the auditorium of Gezhi Middle School in the city at 2:00 pm yesterday. More than 800 members of the Municipal Party Department and cadres at all levels attended the meeting, which was chaired and addressed by Director Fang. Then Secretary Xie Renzhao and others delivered speeches successively, and the meeting adjourned at about 4 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Frequent Welcoming and Sending Off for the Comfort of Troops Transiting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Committee for Welcoming and Comforting Troops Transiting for the Suppression of Rebellion has been working extremely hard in recent days.

The officers and soldiers were all inspired by what they heard.

<h3>The Industry Federation Met to Discuss Land and Had No Proper Solution</h3>
<p>The representatives of the National Federation of Industries residing in Shanghai continued to hold a meeting at the 5th floor of the Enterprise Building at 3 pm yesterday. More than 100 representatives from Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Qing, Gan, Min, Shu, Jin, Su, Han and other places attended the meeting, including Pan Yangshan, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongzhu, Li Zhuchen, Wang Taizhen, Zhang Jian, Peng Shihong, Yu Putian, and Liu Dongye. Li Zhuchen served as the temporary chairman. Among the representatives from Nanjing, Chen Yunzhang was also recommended to come to Shanghai to convey opinions, hoping that the representatives residing in Shanghai would go to Nanjing to hold a meeting. After discussion, the representatives residing in Shanghai believed that there was no preconceived opinion on whether the meeting should be held in Beijing or Shanghai, but because there were more representatives residing in Shanghai, transportation would indeed be a problem if everyone went to Beijing. After a long discussion, there was still no proper solution. It was decided to hold a discussion meeting again at the original location at 10 am today to continue the discussion.</p>
<h3>The Tofu Industry Lacks Soybeans; The Workers' Union Asks for the Source</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Most tofu shops in the city have suspended operations and closed due to the lack of soybeans, causing panic among workers who have lost their jobs. The workers' union in the industry has submitted a request to the authorities to unblock the source of soybeans so that the capitalists can restore normal operations and stabilize the lives of the workers.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Prices Plummet; Rice Stalls are Everywhere, but No One Asks About Them</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the revised method for issuing gold yuan notes and the method for handling gold, silver and foreign currencies owned by the people, the general situation in the city has been good. Yesterday, the prices of various commodities did not continue to rise, especially the price of cigarettes, which plummeted. The retail price of cigarettes, such as Three Cannon Towers, once sold for 18 yuan per pack, but yesterday it was 7 yuan per pack. White tin packs fell from 17 yuan per pack to 8 yuan per pack, and 20-piece Qianmen packs fell from 10 yuan per pack to 5.5 yuan per pack. As for the situation of food rice, it is even more stable. Yesterday, all rice stores in the city sold snow-white rice, with a price of 800 yuan per Dan, but very few people asked about it. The reason is that a huge amount of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai in a few days. A batch of rice from Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, has also been airlifted to Shanghai, and because it is not easy to buy rice in the urban area, the families in the city have been rushing to buy it in the nearby rural areas. Therefore, the rising trend of rice prices has been thwarted. Yesterday, temporary rice stalls were densely distributed along Baoshan Road and North Henan Road in the North Station area of the city, and they were selling rice by the Dou and Sheng, with a price of 70 yuan per Dou, but still few people asked about it.</p>
<h3>Compiling the Index is a Major Key; Rice, Coal, etc. Face Calculating Prices; Must Wait for the Municipal Council to Decide</h3>
<p>Regarding the compilation of the cost of living index for the first half of this month, a person in charge of the Municipal Statistics Office told a Dagongshe reporter yesterday: "Our office has never interrupted the investigation of commodity prices. After the cost of living index is restored for salary calculation, we will follow the past method of investigating commodity prices, investigating once every Tuesday and Friday. Yesterday (12th) was the last time for the commodity price investigation of the cost of living index for the first half of this month. The items of daily necessities calculated are still 45 kinds for workers and 93 kinds for staff. However, after the price limit is lifted this time, there is still a major key in the compilation of the first cost of living index, which needs to be decided by the municipal council to be held today, that is, whether several important daily necessities such as rice and coal are calculated according to the ration price. It is also learned that after the compilation of the cost of living index this time, the cost of living index compilation review committee organized by the original representatives of various agencies and groups will be responsible for reviewing and announcing it."</p>
<h3>The Wage Borrowing Movement in the Knitting Industry Was Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 500 hand-operated knitting machine groups and thousands of workers in the knitting industry requested a wage borrowing movement due to the hardship of their lives. The workers in each factory negotiated directly with the capitalists, resulting in the suspension of work and sitting down to borrow wages in factories such as Xiongdi Er You Zhenghua Rui Da. After learning about this, the Social Affairs Bureau sent staff to mediate overnight and advised the workers to resume work first and return to their homes, and wait for the wage borrowing problem to be handled in accordance with legal procedures. At 10 am yesterday, the Labour-Capital Knitting Industry Workers' Union and the Capital-Knitting Industry Guild were convened to make every effort to mediate, and a satisfactory solution was reached: (1) The wages for October 37 will be issued by each factory in accordance with the method agreed upon by both parties, and one month's wage equivalent to the actual wage earned by each worker in October will be issued. (2) For November 37, each factory will be allowed to borrow wages in advance and give them to the workers. Both parties agreed that the socks produced by each factory will be issued at the factory's price. (3) Small-scale factories that are unable to bear the advance borrowing in November may negotiate on their own between labour and capital. (4) The amount of the advance borrowing stipulated in the second item will be deducted by each factory in instalments starting from November. (5) After the workers of each factory receive the advance borrowing in November, they shall not leave the factory without permission before they are paid off, and the capitalists of each factory shall copy the national identity cards of each worker for reference.</p>

<h3>Traffic Police Officer Beaten Up While on Duty; Compensation and Apologies Result in a Settlement</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] At the intersection of Zhongzheng West Road and Fan Yu Road at about 4:30 pm yesterday, Cao Guangtai, a police officer from the Second Traffic Police Brigade, was in a hurry to board a public bus on official duty, which led to a quarrel with the ticket seller on the bus, and then to a fight.

<h3>Garrison Command Cracks Down on Major Organization Aiding Communists; Nine Key Suspects Arrested for Illicitly Purchasing Large Quantities of Western Medicine</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command recently cracked down on a large-scale organization established in Shanghai by the Jianghai Company of the Third District of the Subei Military Region of the Communist bandits. This organization was dedicated to illicitly purchasing supplies to aid the bandits. Nine key suspects were apprehended. The details of the crackdown are as follows: At the beginning of this month, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command received a confidential report stating that the Jianghai Company of the Third District of the Subei Military Region of the Communist bandits had recently transported pigs to Shanghai to illicitly purchase large quantities of supplies, intending to smuggle them to the bandit areas to support the bandits. The Garrison Command dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed the report. They learned that a bandit ship, Xiaoyuansha (No. 7753), had loaded pigs from the bandit area on the 3rd and arrived in Shanghai. It was preparing to illicitly purchase large quantities of Western medicine and was planning to depart on the 4th, taking advantage of the tide to sail out of the Yangjing estuary and transport the goods back to the bandit area. After receiving the report, Commander Xuan immediately ordered action to be taken. At 3:00 PM on the 4th, he dispatched a large number of officers to Yangjing to prepare. Around 5:00 PM, the bandit ship did indeed set sail with the tide. Personnel from the Garrison Command intercepted and seized the ship as it sailed to the Yangjing estuary. A search revealed a large quantity of Western medicines such as Soothachin and Suddia anti-inflammatory tablets hidden in the ship's lower hold. The captain, Su Zhenglin, and another Western medicine merchant aiding the bandits, Lu Fulin, were immediately arrested and taken to the Garrison Command for interrogation. After rigorous questioning, it was learned that the purchasers in Shanghai for the Jianghai Company of the Third District of the Subei Military Region of the Communist bandits were Liu Jinfu and Ding Zhenghong. Ding lived at No. 317 Gongxing Road, Zhabei, in this city, and the organization for illicitly purchasing supplies to aid the bandits was also located there. However, Ding had falsely established the Zhenchang Knitting Factory as a cover, and Liu Jinfu was posing as a technician at the factory. The Garrison Command immediately dispatched personnel to search and arrest the suspects. Ding Zhenghong had already fled, but Liu Jinfu was arrested on the spot. A large quantity of supplies and evidence were seized. After rigorous interrogation, the following key suspects were arrested: Wang Ruiqing, Sun Yongkang, Wu Wenzhi, Zhang Mengsheng, Chen Yafei, Yang Yu, and Mao Yuqing. They confessed that, in addition to illicitly purchasing Western medicine, they had also smuggled large quantities of military firearms and explosives to the bandit area. Considering the seriousness of the case and the wide range of involvement, the Garrison Command is currently interrogating the suspects overnight and pursuing the remaining criminals. More significant developments may occur in the coming days.</p>

Mayor Wu was attending a meeting in Nanjing, and he sincerely thanked those who led the planning, donated funds, and built this hospital.</p>
<p>Economic Difficulties Finally Overcome</p>
<p>Subsequently, Wu Kaixian, chairman of the Social Welfare Undertakings Committee and director of the Social Affairs Bureau, reported on the construction process, stating that the Labor Hospital's completion ceremony on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth and National Doctors' Day was of profound significance. After the groundbreaking ceremony in October last year, prices fluctuated sharply, but economic difficulties were finally overcome, and this arduous project was completed. A staff dormitory was also added. All construction costs were funded by donations from every citizen without their conscious knowledge. At that time, the household sugar ration was priced low at one jin per person per month. With Mayor Wu's approval, an additional one fen welfare fund was added to each jin of sugar. In this way, grain by grain, through the strength of the masses, this great project was completed. The total construction cost was 111.7 billion legal tender and over 20,000 gold yuan.</p>
<p>Board of Directors Formed for Joint Management</p>
<p>Now that the hospital has been built, representatives from government and industry have been invited to form a board of directors for joint management. By the end of September, a fund of 100,000 gold yuan had been raised as operating expenses. It is hoped that the health authorities will provide more assistance in the future so that the hospital's business can develop and truly benefit the workers. Subsequently, Fang Zhi, Lu Jingshi, Zhang Wei, Liu Ruiheng, Shui Xiangyun, and the labor attachés of the American Embassy and the British Embassy, Zhu Gengsheng and Hede, respectively, delivered speeches. Finally, engineer Wang Ziyang handed over the keys to all the buildings to Director Wu and presented them to Secretary Shen. The meeting was adjourned after a photograph was taken. The first board of directors meeting was then held.</p>

<h3>The Full Picture of the Huainan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Dou Baiping</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Jiulonggang, 7th] Amidst the heavy war situation and the destruction of many industrial and mining enterprises in the country, we especially cherish the prosperity and growth of the Huainan Coal Mine on the south bank of the Huaihe River in northern Anhui, which is only 160 kilometers in a straight line from Nanjing. Speaking of the Huainan Mine, from its historical process, production status, and future prospects, facing the current reality of widespread coal shortage, the reporter first appeals to the government to provide special support and assistance to this Huainan Mine, which is closest to the capital, so that it can fully exert its capabilities on the road to national construction. The Huainan Mine currently has three iron fields: Jiulonggang, Datong, and Bagongshan. The entire mining area occupies a surface area of 470,000 mu.</p>
<p>Coal Mining Situation: Currently, the Jiuneng and Datong fields have a total of twelve vertical shafts and two inclined shafts, which are used to supply coal, hoist materials, transport personnel up and down, and for ventilation. The underground development project involves opening up main roadways in the rock layer or coal seam with a solid top and bottom. A rock door is opened every 100 to 150 meters, penetrating each coal seam. Then, coal roadways are opened along the coal seam. From the coal roadway, a coal eye is opened upwards every 30 to 40 meters, and a 45-degree upward-sloping tunnel is opened for easy material transportation. Then, a counter ditch is opened every 15 meters in height. The coal limits between the counter ditches are staggered by three or four meters to the left and right, for a total of five counter ditches, reaching the upper old tunnel. To date, the deepest underground development project in each mining field is 330 meters.</p>
<p>After the coal limits and counter ditches are opened, the miners divide the coal into several squares and use the collapse method, starting the retreat mining from the upper counter ditch. This is locally known as "luoduo," which means first excavating the lower part of the innermost square, causing the upper part to fall on its own, and then gradually retreating from the inside to the outside. It is said that the miners are very skilled in this method, but the recovery rate is only about 60%. When mining coal seams with solid tops and bottoms, it is planned to use the complete warehouse pillar method. This method was used in the eastern part of Datong Mine at the 240-meter level, south of the sixth rock door, in August last year, and the results were good. However, due to the miners' lack of technical proficiency, it is still being improved.</p>
<p>The coal is transported within the counter ditch entirely by manual labor. It is dropped from the coal eye to the coal roadway, loaded into coal cars, which run on steel rails, and pushed manually through the rock door to the main roadway. Then, it is hoisted to the surface by a winch cage. At the 330-meter level of the Jiulong South Mine field, diesel locomotives are now being used to transport coal, and they are being installed. At the 330-meter level of the Datong Mine field, endless rope trolleys are used to transport coal, and there are four sets of endless belt conveyors, which send the coal directly from the wellhead to the screening machine, and then to the coal bin after screening.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Equipment</p>
<p>Through the accumulation of bit by bit of blood and sweat, the current coal mining equipment includes 29 various types of boilers, 24 various types of electric and steam winches, 7 air compressors, 30 electric pumps, 1,202 coal cars, air pots, air hammers, and machine factory equipment, all of which are available.</p>
<p>Electricity is supplied by the Huainan Power Plant in Tianjia'an. The plant has a generating capacity of 9,200 KW, which is transmitted to each mine at 22,000 volts high voltage. The substations in each mine transform it into 3,300 volts or 380-220 volts, which are used to power the large and small machines.</p>
<p>Coking was done using indigenous methods in Jiulong South in 1946. In 1947, the Datong coking field was expanded. Through efforts and improvements, a total of 1,278 tons of coke was produced by the end of August this year. It is said that it is popular in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Achievements in Three Years</p>
<p>From the victory in 1945 to this year, just enough time has passed. Huainan Mine has enriched its equipment and increased its coal production in three years, and its current scale has been established. The development of a production enterprise lies in increasing production. After the takeover of the Huainan Mine, new wells were built after rectification, adding three new wells and a new air shaft, which is worth special mention.</p>
<p>Datong No. 3 well was planned to be excavated during the Japanese occupation. Construction continued after the restoration. By the end of last year, it had been mined to 346 meters, with an inner diameter of 6 meters, a stone-built well ring, and a reinforced concrete well building. It is equipped with automatic car-changing crawlers. The well frame is 40 meters high and is made entirely of steel. It has a 1,000-horsepower steam winch, and the cage is nailed with double rails, which can hold four 0.85-ton coal cars. The underground main roadway is opened in the rock layer. All engineering equipment has been completed and began to be used in October this year, with a daily output of 3,000 tons of coal. This well has the newest equipment in the Huainan Mine. Unfortunately, when the reporter arrived, it was shut down for repairs, and the original plan to go down the well to visit was called off. No. 7 well started construction in January last year and had reached 330 meters in October this year. Mining Director Zhang Guangzheng said: It is estimated that the total depth is 420 meters and will be completed in June next year. The inner diameter is 5 meters, and it is also a stone-built well ring, with a 40 cm concrete injection after the stone rotation, and an electric winch of 600 horsepower. The original depth of No. 3 well in Jiulonggang mining field was 177.5 meters. The deepening work started in July 1946 and was completed at the end of last year, deepening to 330 meters. The winch room has been completed, and automatic tanks are being designed and manufactured. It is estimated that the daily output of coal will be 2,500 tons.</p>
<p>An air shaft is being opened between the Datong and Jiulonggang mines. It is planned to be 330 meters deep. Construction started in May last year and has now reached 180 meters, with an inner diameter of 5 meters. It has two outlets for air, equipped with two centrifugal fans, 375 horsepower, rotating 600 times per minute, with an air volume of 41,600 cubic meters per minute and an air pressure of 250 cm.</p>
<p>New plans</p>
<p>The Huainan Mine currently has three mining fields, with a total coal reserve of 550 million tons. Based on the current daily output of 4,000 tons, it can be mined for 382 years. The Mining Bureau is working day and night to increase production, but as a public enterprise, it is limited by financial resources. Coal cannot automatically come out of the well. In this turbulent year, it is very difficult to obtain loans. The focus is now on the US$3.5 million aid loan in March next year. The initial draft of the new plan has been completed. Director Wang said that if it proceeds according to the plan, the daily output can reach 15,000 tons in two years, which is exactly the same as deepening the current output. If this continues, it can be mined for 100 years.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Gazetteer of Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 10th] The Gazetteer of Jiangxi Province has now been compiled and completed in its first draft by the Jiangxi Literature Committee. However, due to the committee's financial difficulties, it lacks the funds for printing. The chief editor, Wu Zongci, has written to the Provincial Assembly, requesting them to find a way to raise funds to print 500 copies, with the principle of distributing an average of five copies to each county. The entire book is divided into: (1) eight chapters belonging to historical reference materials; (2) nine chapters belonging to arts and literature; (3) thirty volumes belonging to literary collections; (4) biographies of historical figures; (5) five chapters belonging to geography; (6) four chapters belonging to clans; (7) one chapter belonging to ethnic groups; (8) two chapters belonging to chronicles of major events; (9) one chapter belonging to literary inquisitions in Jiangxi; (10) two chapters belonging to religion; (11) three chapters belonging to dialects and folk rhymes; (12) two chapters belonging to foreign affairs; and (13) three chapters belonging to maps. The chief editor, Wu Zongci, is a veteran journalist who is now in his seventies.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The veteran journalist Wu Zongci has recently completed his "Chronicle of the Xinhai Revolution and the Restoration of Jiangxi." The content is divided into: the revolutionary movement before the Xinhai Uprising, the restoration of Jiujiang, the restoration of Nanchang, a special record of the deeds of sending troops to aid other provinces after the uprising, other important events, the Battle of Hukou, and the Chronicle of the Campaign Against Yuan Shikai. This manuscript is the only record of the history of Jiangxi's sacrifices for the revolution. Unfortunately, due to the Literature Committee's financial difficulties, it cannot be printed for the time being.</p>
<h3>Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, USA Actively Researches the Atomic Nucleus, Which Will Bring New Contributions to Medicine, Agriculture, and Industry</h3>
<p>Research on the atomic nucleus is progressing rapidly at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, USA (65 miles from New York), which has become the center of atomic nucleus research. Talented scientists from all over the northeastern United States are concentrating their efforts at the National Brookhaven Laboratory to increase human knowledge of atomic nuclear forces and their beneficial uses, and to train many young scientists to continue this work.</p>
<p>Increasing Applied Knowledge</p>
<p>The main purpose of this work is the basic research on atomic energy and the nature of matter itself, that is, to devote itself to the study of the uses of atoms in culture and construction. It is expected that this work will increase the applied knowledge in medicine, agriculture, and industry.</p>
<p>In medicine, radioactive iodine is now available for the treatment of various tumors, and radioactive phosphorus can also be used for medical treatment. The scientists at the laboratory will study the slight differences in the radioactivity of the two elements. In the future, they hope to cooperate with hospitals abroad to jointly study radioactivity and make greater discoveries in arteriosclerosis, diabetes, and degenerative diseases. Scientists have already conducted regional experiments on the research of radioactive isotopes in agriculture. According to Dr. Morse, the director of Brookhaven, the future of agriculture is indeed exciting.</p>
<p>Research Objectives</p>
<p>Regarding the "atomic dreams" of many writers who have written about atomic energy, such as how to use an atomic engine as small as a broad bean to drive a ship across the Atlantic, although scientists have not yet studied it, Brookhaven scientists have been studying radioactive carbon for quite some time. Radioactive carbon is made from explosive gas and neutral electrons, so when the research is completed, it is expected to simplify oil refining methods.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Morse, Brookhaven has three goals:</p>
<p>(1) To thoroughly seek new knowledge to apply atomic energy to peace and happiness. (2) To train young scientists to continue working. (3) To eliminate the fear of "atoms" in humans.</p>
<p>Overcoming Psychological Fear</p>
<p>When the residents of Long Island, USA, heard the news that "an atomic research center was being built in Brookhaven," they said in horror that the radioactivity of the elements would kill Long Island's "flies," drive away Long Island's "ducks," destroy Long Island's soil, and make Long Island's coffee taste bitter. In fact, Brookhaven is not a bomb laboratory, and it is definitely not a military organization.</p>
<p>Brookhaven Laboratory has been in existence for more than a year. Although the equipment inside is not fully completed, the work is progressing steadily.</p>
<p>The institute currently employs more than 1,000 people, mostly local people from Long Island who are engaged in engineering work. They have overcome their fear of atoms and are engaged in building a huge nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Two Hundred Scientists</p>
<p>There will be 200 scientists regularly studying at the laboratory, in addition to more than 200 trainees. They will be sent here from universities and educational institutions in the northeastern United States. Many of the scientists are members of the American Physical Society, chemical flavor experts, astronomers, and biochemists. Most of them are young people under the age of 40.</p>
<p>Relatively Free Control</p>
<p>Although the staff of the laboratory are strictly controlled by congressional regulations, especially in terms of atomic energy, which is required to be closely monitored, it is relatively free compared to military management, because the gate of the laboratory is guarded by only one police officer and a middle-aged native. Tourists can visit the area near the institute without any interference. In the location where atomic piles are manufactured, tourists, travelers, and other visitors must, of course, stop at a considerable distance, but all the public security regulations form a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere in Brookhaven.</p>
<p>Dr. Morse said: "When we started working, it was difficult for us to recruit scientists, because they were unwilling to work under government supervision. Therefore, we eradicated the shackles of supervision and developed a 'university-style freedom,' so the performance of the work has been quite excellent so far." (Translated by Guangxin)</p>

<h3>Fengxian Holds In-Kind Donation Drive to Stabilize the Lives of Public School Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>[Our Fengxian Dispatch, 10th] The county budget for the second half of this year has been completely disrupted due to drastic fluctuations in prices. In order to stabilize the living standards of public school teachers and staff and soldiers, the authorities have drafted a method for the people to donate goods in kind, which has been submitted to the County Assembly for a decision. The total tax amount for the county is 500,000 yuan, and four shi (pecks) of white rice will be donated for each yuan of tax. The collection will begin on January 5, 1938. The county will hire local people to form a committee to plan and handle the technical aspects of the collection. It is also understood that the county will implement a salary-in-rice system starting next year, with each civil servant receiving an average of 1.6 dan (160 liters) of white rice per month. From then on, their lives should be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Province Adjusts County-Level Organizations and Will Increase Compensation</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our Guiyang Dispatch, 8th] One of the purposes of Guizhou Province's current adjustment of county-level organizations is to increase compensation, because the compensation of personnel in county-level organizations in border provinces is far lower than what people in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, etc. can imagine. Currently, county public school teachers and staff in nearby provincial capitals, such as secretaries and section chiefs, are considered quite prominent figures in the counties and townships, but their monthly income does not exceed six gold yuan. The current adjustment plan stipulates that, for staff positions, the base salary will be tentatively set at 10 gold yuan. For every 10 yuan above 10 yuan, 1 gold yuan will be issued. For example, if the base salary for a county government secretary or section chief at the first level of appointment is 200 yuan, they will receive a salary of 29 yuan. Counties with sufficient finances and higher living standards can increase this on their own, even to the point of matching provincial-level compensation, in order to achieve the goal of equal pay for equal work. For soldiers and police, the monthly food allowance is 1 yuan for staple food, 1 yuan for non-staple food, and 4 yuan for pay. The staple food allowance will be issued in kind according to a fixed quantity, and the proceeds will be transferred to the account. For technicians and corvée laborers, the monthly wage will be 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Reducing Redundancy and Rectifying Taxes</p>
<p>The Guizhou Provincial Government stipulates that the adjustment plan will be implemented from January 1938, but the provincial government issued the contents of the plan to the counties recently as the basis for preparing for implementation. After receiving the order, the counties immediately began to lay off personnel. The salaries of all those laid off will be paid until the end of this year to show compassion. At the same time, they will earnestly rectify various taxes and levies, thoroughly eliminate embezzlement, and eradicate tax evasion in order to increase revenue. If the counties can allocate a portion of business expenses in addition to adjusting the compensation of public school teachers and staff for the purpose of promoting various construction projects, it would be most appropriate and ideal. As for impoverished counties, the provincial government will find other ways to provide overall subsidies and hopes to achieve self-sufficiency in the short term.</p>
<p>Invigorating the Spirit and Abiding by the Law</p>
<p>In his final report, Mr. Gu said that the purpose of his drastic and reckless adjustment of county-level organizations was that in the past, there were often county magistrates and county-level personnel who were not diligent in their duties and were always perfunctory in local administration, or they used the excuse that their compensation was too low and not enough to make ends meet as a pretext for corruption and abuse of power. He said that if this bad atmosphere was not eradicated, the people's administration would not improve. As for the establishment of county-level organizations, in the past, most of them were people who did not know the situation at the grassroots level. Whenever the central government or the province needed to set up an organization to handle something, the county also had to set up an organization to handle it. Over time, the county-level organizations became overlapping and cumbersome, which was indeed the case. If they were not thoroughly adjusted, it would certainly not be possible for people of goodwill who sincerely wanted to do something to have the convenience of promoting their interests. Mr. Gu hopes that all county magistrates and county-level personnel in his province will invigorate their spirits and earnestly engage in their work from the date of the implementation of this adjustment plan. At the same time, county-level personnel should be honest and self-disciplined.</p>
<p>Ningxia's Land Reform Will Be Implemented First in Jinji County</p>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 12th] According to Kang Yushu, a member of the Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai Border Area Supervisory Commission who recently returned from inspecting Ningxia, Ningxia's land reform has selected Jinji County and can be implemented next spring. In addition, there are also major decisions to establish collective farms and eliminate usury. He also said that Mi County is adjacent to bandit areas, so the grassroots organization and militia training are very strict, and the local area is relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Holds Granting of Land to Dependents of Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 10th] In order to promote conscription administration and find ways to support the families of soldiers who are fighting bandits, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has formulated methods for granting wasteland to the families of soldiers who are fighting bandits and for substitute farming. The methods stipulate that the target of those entitled to land grants shall be new conscripts recruited according to the conscription procedures, and the list of soldiers handed over by the county (city) government shall be the basis for allocating wasteland to their families. If those who voluntarily join the army, the certificate of soldiers directly participating in combat issued by the unit they serve in (military division or independent brigade) shall be used as a reference for allocation.</p>
<p>According to Article 4 of the original method, the standard for land allocation is: the direct relatives of the conscripts, such as grandparents, parents, spouses, children, and younger siblings (under the age of 18), shall be allocated no more than 5 mu (0.82 acres) per person. If they already have their own cultivated land, the amount shall be reduced accordingly to ensure that they can maintain a minimum standard of living.</p>
<p>The land allocated by each county (city) to the families of soldiers shall be all the cultivable wasteland and barren hills within the county. The township and village officials shall conduct a detailed survey. If it is privately owned, the government shall purchase it and return it to the public, and it shall be distributed evenly according to the number of soldier dependents in the local area. A portion shall be controlled for continued allocation. If the land in each county (city) is not sufficient for allocation, Article 6 of the original method stipulates as follows: The quantity of land owned by wealthy households in the local area shall be thoroughly investigated, and they shall be persuaded to give up a portion of the required land for allocation. The government shall purchase it at a fair price according to law to allocate to the families of soldiers who are fighting.</p>
<p>The local government shall issue an allocation certificate to the land allocated to the families of soldiers by the government. The soldier's family shall keep the certificate, and the land shall be exempt from land taxes and all other surcharges for five years from the date of allocation. After the expiration, the government shall take back the allocation certificate and exchange it for a formal management certificate (handled according to general regulations). This shall be considered as the ownership of the land, which is completely in the hands of the soldier's family. Therefore, the general collection of taxes shall also be based on the usual practice. However, if the soldier's family lacks the manpower to cultivate the land allocated by the government, the latter part of Article 7 of the original method stipulates: A substitute farming team shall be organized by the village, with the village chief as the captain and the neighborhood chief as the squad leader. All men within the village who are between the ages of 18 and 45 (excluding soldier dependents) shall be organized into the team and have the obligation to cultivate the land for the soldier dependents in this village (including all agricultural work).</p>
<p>The substitute farming team shall be led by the village chief, who shall be responsible for directing and substituting for the farming of the soldier dependents in this village. If any member of the team is unable to engage in farming, they may pay to hire a worker to substitute, but they may not substitute with the old, young, or those who are unable to perform labor. Article 10 stipulates that the substitute farming team shall not accept any remuneration or hospitality from the soldier dependents, except for cases where the soldier dependents voluntarily provide tea and water. If the soldier dependents lack the tools, fertilizer, and seeds needed for cultivation, the local village chief shall, at his discretion, provide funds or purchase them on their behalf, which shall be returned without interest after the autumn harvest. If there is a lack of draft cattle, the village chief shall borrow them fairly from families in the village who have draft cattle in accordance with Article 11 of the original method.</p>
<p>However, if the soldier dependent violates any of the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Soldiers and Their Families During the Mobilization Period (except for Article 14, paragraph 3), Article 14 of the original method clearly stipulates that the allocated land shall be completely recovered, and the benefits already obtained shall be recovered according to the severity of the circumstances and used as a subsidy for soldier dependents.</p>
<p>Dian-Qian-Gui Railway to Begin Construction Next Spring [Our Kunming Dispatch, 12th] The construction of the Dian-Qian-Gui Railway has been under discussion for a long time. The Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to this and has approved the allocation of 2.5 million gold yuan as initial engineering expenses. It has also ordered the establishment of a construction engineering team within the month, and full-scale construction will begin next spring.</p>
<h3>"Rickshaw Boy" to Be Filmed Is a Pipe Dream</h3>
<p>"Moment in Peking" to Be Filmed Instead</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] The filming of "Rickshaw Boy" has become a pipe dream. Huang Zongzhan recently sent a letter from the United States to Ms. Li Bingsun in Beiping (who was scheduled to play the actor Huzi) saying that Pan American Company believes that the book "Rickshaw Boy" is outdated and most people oppose its production. Huang himself does not intend to film it at his own expense due to the huge cost. However, Pan American Company is still considering filming a Chinese film, with Lin Yutang's "Moment in Peking" being the most promising.</p>
<h3>Miniature News</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The local newspapers here on the 10th published a letter from a reader stating that someone at No. 24 Shizi Street was hoarding more than 2,000 dan (200,000 liters) of rice. Chairman Ding read the newspaper and immediately ordered Xie Bi, the magistrate of Zhenjiang County, to investigate thoroughly. However, there was no No. 24 there, and no one nearby was hoarding rice. Later, the county government discovered that the inspection team of the Materials Adjustment Office had found a total of more than 2,000 dan (200,000 liters) of unregistered rice, paddy, and wheat in Wanyou and Xiehexiang Rice Mills on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 3rd of this month. Both mills claimed that it was public grain or military grain, but did not provide proof. The inspection team did not investigate further. Those who knew about this matter believed that it was hoarded by someone powerful. The newspaper reader's letter was a diversion. County Magistrate Xie Bi summoned rice merchants for a discussion on the evening of the 10th and ordered them to report their accounts and provide evidence, otherwise, he would order them to sell at a fixed price.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] The Economic Supervisory Committee, which has been closed, has completed the handling of confiscated materials. Fifty percent will be used for the committee's public expenses, 30 percent will be used as bonuses for informants, and 2 percent will be used for local public works repairs.</p>
<p>Wuhu</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Wuhu County Government previously announced restrictions on the export of materials, which will be lifted with immediate effect. In order to promote the smooth flow of goods, maintain the sales of legal merchants, and understand the market's surplus and deficit, items such as rice, rapeseed, soybeans, flour, and cotton yarn, in quantities of 50 dan (5,000 liters) or five pieces, must be registered and a registration certificate issued to facilitate circulation.</p>
<h3>Gold Yuan to Gold Note Ratio Revised, General Prices Decline, White Rice Traded at 600, Rice Supply Increases</h3>
<p>After the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting passed the new ratio between the gold yuan and gold foreign currencies, various prices have stabilized. Yesterday, due to the Prime Minister's birthday holiday, all industries were closed, so there were no official quotations, but off-site bids were soft. Rice prices have improved due to the increase in peddlers shipping to Shanghai, and some rice shops also have rice to supply. The rice shortage has improved. White rice is quoted at 600 yuan per dan (100 liters), and peddlers are willing to sell. At the same time, the rice purchased by the Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Association is being urged to ship, and is on the way and will arrive in Shanghai one after another, so the rice shortage problem can be gradually solved.</p>
<h3>Allowing Silver Dollars to Circulate: A Glimpse of the Financial Community's Attitude</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting decided the day before yesterday to allow silver dollars to circulate freely, adjust the official prices of gold and silver, and conditionally allow gold yuan notes to be exchanged for hard currency, people in the financial community here have taken a reserved attitude towards the possibility of stabilizing the currency value. They believe that if the Central Bank can exchange gold yuan and silver dollars at the prescribed exchange rate and supply them in large quantities so that hard currency can circulate in the market, it will contribute to the improvement of the currency's credibility.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is doubtful whether the provision in the new method for exchanging gold yuan notes for gold yuan can collect a large number of gold yuan notes under the current situation of tight silver.</p>
<h3>Restoring Free Market Trading: Prices Should Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>After the authorities stipulated the implementation of "negotiated prices" and "cost-based pricing" based on the economic supplementary measures, all prices once formed a chaotic situation. The main reason was that after the opening of food self-application and purchase, rice prices soared, causing various prices to rise as well, so that it was impossible for various industries to trade according to negotiated prices. For example, in terms of general industrial finished products, factory negotiated prices were only a few times higher than the "819" limited price, while the retail price on the market exceeded more than ten times. Such an abnormal state made the "negotiated price" a mere formality and ineffective. The losses suffered by factories for other industrial finished products with "cost-based pricing" were even greater. According to the general opinion of the industrial community, under the current situation, the so-called "negotiated price" and "cost-based pricing" seem to be redundant. If the government can solve problems such as food regulation and raw material supply under the principle of stabilizing the economy, restoring free market trading across the board, then various prices will gradually decline, and the production of industrial cost goods can also tend to be normal.</p>
<h3>Mint to Start Work, Increase Minting of Gold and Silver Standard Coins, Factory Director Wei Flies to Beijing to Visit Finance Minister Xu</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting passed the amendment to the gold yuan note issuance method and decided to issue gold yuan coins made of gold and silver in addition to the gold yuan note, the minting work of the Central Mint after that will be to increase the minting of gold and silver standard coins in large quantities in addition to the auxiliary coins currently minted to meet the needs of circulation.</p>
<p>It is learned that Factory Director Wei flew to Beijing by plane yesterday morning. It is reported that the important task of this trip is to visit the newly appointed Finance Minister Xu Kan. However, it is generally speculated that it is related to asking for instructions on minting new coins.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wei, before the factory receives new instructions, the auxiliary coins to be minted are still limited to the one-cent copper coin and the 50-cent silver coin.</p>
<p>Fifty-Cent Silver Coins Will Be Issued First</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The gold yuan note issuance method has been revised and it has been decided to mint gold yuan coins. The Central Mint has prepared to start minting new gold and silver coins. As soon as the new model of gold yuan from the Ministry of Finance and the official order arrive, minting can begin. Because the factory has complete equipment for minting coins, minting can begin at any time. As for the 50-cent silver coins that the factory has planned to mint, a considerable amount has already been minted. If the silver subsidiary coins can still be issued, they should be issued before the gold coins within days.</p>

<h3>Rice Market</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>In the past few days, the rice merchants' faces have shown a smug smile again. Early in the morning, everyone crowded at the market entrance, watching every incoming farmer's boat. As long as they spotted five dou or one shi (units of volume) of rice, they would wave and shout, "Come here, sell it to me! I guarantee you won't regret it!" Some, stamping their feet, anxiously cried, "What's wrong, Uncle Chun? Don't you recognize me anymore?" Even those with some self-awareness, when unable to attract customers, would gesture to indicate that rice prices had skyrocketed. Some would even use their fingers to quote shockingly high prices.</p>
<p>People from the rice shops were almost entirely mobilized, men and women alike, moving in a constant stream. However, their eyes were fixed on the farmers carrying loads on their shoulders. As soon as a bag of white rice appeared, many hands would simultaneously reach for it. Then, a chorus of "Old customer, sell it to me!" would erupt, leaving the villagers at a loss. In the end, the quick-witted naturally prevailed, snatching the bags and silently heading back to their shops.</p>
<p>Groups of customers in short jackets jumped down from the trains, like locusts chasing after rice. They emptied the white rice, then started buying unpolished rice. With a flick of the wrist, the merchants sold the twenty-yuan white rice for thirty yuan into the customers' bags. No matter how much you wanted, once it was sold, you wouldn't even be able to buy back the unpolished rice the next morning.</p>
<p>Today, the situation is a little different, because seventy or eighty short-jacketed customers arrived overnight and crowded among the rice merchants early in the morning, directly dealing with the farmers. White rice was received dou by dou, and the rice price suddenly jumped from thirty, to forty, to fifty. The merchants' shouts seemed less effective than the transient customers.</p>
<p>Then, some people started thinking about the livelihood of the locals. "At this rate, how can the poor survive!" So they started pushing and blocking them to the east side of the road. However, there were also villagers carrying rice to the market on that side, and they crowded around, begging, "Thank you, sell your rice to me!" The villagers naturally saw which way the wind was blowing and quoted very high prices, but after selling and entering the market, they realized they had been taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to be going crazy for rice, staging scenes of tragicomedy. (Sent from Zhengyi)</p>
<h3>Old Haunts of Tianping</h3>
<p>— Xi Hou</p>
<p>Tianping Mountain is also called "Fan Grave Mountain" by Suzhou people, who say that "Fan Wenzheng Gong" of the Song Dynasty is buried there. Later, it was learned that it was a mistake for Fan Xiweng's ancestral tomb. It is also said that a heavenly wind blew the mountain stones upright overnight, and the words "Ten Thousand笏朝天" (Ten Thousand Tablets Facing the Sky) are still on the mountain top to this day. Such a secluded and beautiful place, because the Fan family produced a few figures, was fabricated to be so rich and imposing, with a domineering aura. It really makes me a little resentful of this "poor village chief," even though it has nothing to do with him, and his lyrics are also very lovely. However, in my seven visits to Tianping, I never thought of going near the Fan Tomb to take a look, always going straight up the mountain.</p>
<p>The road to Tianping is roughly divided into two branches, one from Mudu and one from Fengqiao, with more people going from the former. My first visit was on a cold day. The water was shallow, the boat was slow, and I went from outside Xumen towards Fengqiao. I went ashore and ran before I was far from the mountain, crossing "Tongzi Gate" to climb the mountain. I only took that waterway once; it seemed too lonely. Going from Mudu involved crossing the back of Lingyan Mountain, passing through villages and houses, and approaching Tianping head-on. Once, from Mudu to Tianping, I crossed "Tongzi Gate" again, looking for a way to enter the city towards Fengqiao, which was more strenuous. The next time, I went the other way around, walking from Fengqiao to climb the mountain and going around to Mudu to take a boat back. Generally speaking, walking while playing on the mountain allows you to take in more scenery. Every five steps is a view, every ten steps a wonder. The scenery along the way is enough to compensate for the effort.</p>
<p>I remember the most satisfying time was hiking in a group. Stepping over the ancient Fengqiao, following the herringbone-shaped "Royal Passage," we first went to Guanyin Mountain, crossed Dachi Mountain, Hua Mountain, and climbed straight to the top of Tianping. Tianchi is famous for its stone peaks, magnificent and majestic, but remote and rarely visited. Legend has it that the Luomu Nunnery of the Ming Dynasty's Xu Yuan sighed was on Tianchi Mountain, which is the "Jiangdong Left a Xu Bi" in Qian Muqi's poem. The site is no longer traceable. I recently read a couplet in Liang's poem about falling leaves: "The desolate nunnery is gradually aging, Xu Yuan sighed, and the muddy wine is related to Cui Buli." The second line uses the "Huangye Sheng Duo Jiu Bu Ci" ("The sound of yellow leaves is loud, and I don't refuse wine") poetry of "Cui Huangye," both of which are praised as wonderful. I include this as an aside.</p>
<p>Tianping's stone bamboo shoots stand tall, covered in iron-like rust, some lying horizontally and vertically, in natural positions. Among the mountains in the southeast of Suzhou, Tianping is particularly unique and independent, and never gets old. A temple is hidden halfway up the mountain, with "Boyu Spring" water dripping all day long. Inside is the "Jianshan Pavilion," leaning on the pavilion to listen to the maple trees, completely forgetting worldly worries. In the late spring and early summer, sitting under the "Line of Sky," you can sometimes hear the "Wuchun" bird chirping in the mountain, its crisp sound penetrating the forest, rich in stone rhyme. Further up is "Middle White Cloud," a large stone protruding over a zhang (unit of length), covered in ancient moss. Lying prostrate on the stone, looking down at the maple forest, red leaves surged like a tide, and a goshawk swept past, touching its back with my hand. The highest point is "Upper White Cloud," with a panoramic view of the undulating distant mountains and the vast Lake Tai, standing alone in the vastness, and sorrow comes when the joy ends. Going back and forth in the mountains countless times, not only do the monks recognize my face, but the mountain birds welcome people. Leaning against the stone to find a chant, I also remembered Su Shi's line, "I already feel that the fishing stone is warm from coming so often."</p>
<p>Tianping's red leaves have become the target of autumn tourists. But Tianping's red maples are all hundreds of years old, standing tall in the valley, so huge that they can be embraced, with old branches and large, scattered leaves, turning bright as clouds and mist after frost. It is not like a single chicken maple tree in a hedge, adorning a cold and beautiful small scene.</p>
<p>It has been twelve years since I went to Tianping. Every time I think of it, I feel that the mossy stones and frosty forests emerge before my eyes. A few days ago, the children said they were going to Tianping for a hike, and I also told them not to forget to pick up a few red leaves to bring back.</p>
<h3>Lyrics of Haihonglou</h3>
<p>— Banmeng</p>
<p>Tune: "Washing Brook Silk"</p>
<p>A skinny horse treads on the ancient plain in the west wind,</p>
<p>A desolate owl cries in an old house in the autumn mist.</p>
<p>The sound of water from the bridge where the boats return.</p>
<p>Lonely at dusk, I often sit alone.</p>
<p>Leaning on the painted railing, I cherish my remaining years,</p>
<p>And ask the vast sky with muddy wine.</p>
<p>Tune: "Fishing Boat Flute"</p>
<p>A cold eye to the river and sky,</p>
<p>A few pieces shattered and echoed in the vastness.</p>
<p>A fisherman on a sandbar in a single boat,</p>
<p>Fishing for the cold moon among the yellow reeds.</p>
<p>A good wind blows away half a bit of sorrow,</p>
<p>A little bit, it flickers and disappears.</p>
<p>Carrying brocade scales dipped in wine,</p>
<p>Playing the long flute with plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Tune: "Yu Meiren"</p>
<p>When will autumn come and spring go?</p>
<p>Let the years grow old at will.</p>
<p>Joys, sorrows, partings, and reunions are all empty,</p>
<p>But I believe that the rise and fall of ancient and modern times are the same.</p>
<p>Give up on striving in the world!</p>
<p>It's all predestined.</p>
<p>A thousand worries are locked in my brow,</p>
<p>I only fear that my life, like falling flowers, will lose its charm.</p>
<h3>Census</h3>
<p>— Xiaoying</p>
<p>This time, the city implemented a general census, mobilizing more than 40,000 high school students and above to participate in the work. The author was also nominated by the school's training office and assigned to a certain Bao and Jia (administrative units) on Xujiahui Road in Changshu District to work as a "civil servant" for one night.</p>
<p>Sadly, the three yuan subsidy issued by the superiors was used up in buying two dry batteries that night, costing four yuan. I had to pay for the late-night snacks and transportation myself.</p>
<p>The Jia I was assigned to check had many so-called "prominent people." Before setting off, the Bao chief repeatedly told me to be careful, and the "implication" was naturally "understood."</p>
<p>Following Miss Jia Chang, I began to carry out my "official duties." The first few households I checked were tenement watchmen and small tailors at the entrance of the alley. Entering their low houses, chairs and tea were immediately offered, as if receiving a distinguished guest, with attentive hospitality, making me feel a little uneasy. Although it was a late autumn night, in that warm human atmosphere, I didn't feel any cold. After finishing the check, they saw me off with proper ceremony, and it could be said that "both host and guest were happy."</p>
<p>Next, I had to check the mansions of those "prominent people." The Bao chief's words were still in my ears, and I felt apprehensive, more troubled than solving a difficult math problem.</p>
<p>The mansions of the "prominent people" were indeed extraordinary. Acting "carefully" as instructed by the Bao chief, I managed to get through it smoothly. However, I gradually felt the loneliness of being at a high place.</p>
<p>At the mansion of one "prominent person," perhaps they were sound asleep. Miss Jia Chang knocked her royal arm sore before someone came out to open the door. We waited in the living room for more than ten minutes before they finally arrived, throwing down their old and new ID cards and index cards. They paid no attention to me, a student whose status was less than one percent of theirs, as if blaming me for disturbing their good dreams. The coldness was ten times colder than the Siberian climate, almost freezing my blood. If it weren't for the amiable and kind smile of Miss Jia Chang, I would have really wanted to emulate Guan Yu's "hanging up his seal and retiring with gold."</p>
<p>Turning it over in my mind, "prominent people" mostly act like this. This is their so-called pretense, and it's not directed specifically at me. Ah Q was resurrected in my heart. Fortunately, this "spiritual comfort" made me feel relaxed and happy, and my steps were lighter on the way home. Otherwise, I might have collapsed halfway.</p>
<h3>Wedding Invitation</h3>
<p>— Shan Shi</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a wedding invitation from a relative. To be honest, the bright red color was rather jarring, and it meant I had to give a gift again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a Chinese custom, and it is not easy to reduce it for a while. In fact, holding a wedding is both a waste of money and effort for the parties involved, and even more of a loss for the guests. The ladies refuse to attend the banquet without wearing a brand-new dress. Imagine how wasteful this is!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the wedding invitation.</p>
<p>Before the war, when I was studying at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Li Hua Tong Public School, a teacher held a wedding. The English headmaster, Mr. Robert, also received a wedding invitation, but the foreigner didn't understand what it was, so he asked a clerk in the registry office. Perhaps this gentleman was faithful to the original text, and he translated it like this: "Please have your whole family come to visit this wedding ceremony." This made Headmaster Robert scratch his head in a hurry, saying, "What should I do? My wife is in London, my children are studying in America, and my daughter can't be notified because she's with her husband in Belgium!" As a result, he wrote a very solemn letter of apology to the teacher. This is a joke caused by "阖第光临" (please grace us with your family's presence).</p>
<p>There is also a special type of wedding invitation where the wedding location is not in the city, yet it still says "恭请光临" (respectfully invite your presence). I think very few guests would travel from other places to attend!</p>
<p>There is also a wedding announcement in the newspaper. In addition to the date, location, and "respectfully invite your presence," there is also a sentence that says, "恕不另柬" (no separate invitations will be sent). However, in reality, most of those who attend the ceremony have received wedding invitations.</p>
<h3>Introducing the "China Yearbook"</h3>
<p>— Bin Zhi</p>
<p>The 1948 "China Yearbook" has been published and is sold by the Zhonghua Book Company. The data used in the book is mainly from 1947, and some data after 1947 is also collected, so the content is the latest. The sources of all data have been carefully investigated and statistically analyzed, so they are accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>The entire book, including the appendix, is divided into 40 chapters, with the order of arrangement based on the responsible businesses of various government departments. In terms of nature, it can be divided into seven categories: general, political, international, military, economic, social, and cultural. The general chapters include geography, administrative regions, population, and religion and language. The political chapters include constitutionalism, political parties, the National Assembly, the central political system, the local political system, legislation, judiciary, examinations, supervision, internal affairs, Mongolian-Tibetan affairs, and overseas Chinese affairs. The international chapters include diplomacy and international relations. The military chapters include national defense and the Red Peril and bandit suppression. The economic chapters include transportation, economic policy, finance, banking, commerce, agricultural economy, forestry and fishery, land reclamation, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, food, land administration, water conservancy, industry, and mining. The social chapters include society, post-war relief, and health. The cultural chapters include education, academics, and news and broadcasting. There is also an appendix at the end.</p>
<p>This is the first "China Yearbook" compiled by the China Yearbook Society. Therefore, in addition to detailing the current situation, the materials also include a brief history of the past. This material may seem redundant in other countries, but it is very useful in China because the yearbooks published in our country in the past mostly failed to be published annually. The chronology of major events in the appendix includes not only domestic and foreign events in 1947 but also a list of major events from the first year of the Republic of China to 1946, which is of great help for inspection.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the "China Yearbook" can abide by the name "Yearbook" and be published annually to promote the new and bring forth the old, so that new data is available at any time. This will not only leave a record in the literature, but also serve as a compass for national construction and social progress.</p>
<h3>Seize Time</h3>
<p>— Tan Ke</p>
<p>The proverb says, "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold." It also says, "Time is money." And "Provide for a rainy day." It can be seen the importance of seizing time. This saying did not begin today, but it is even more apparent today that it is true.</p>
<p>According to reports, because the emergency relief requested by the employees of the two railway lines was not resolved smoothly, they went on a full-scale slowdown. Traffic on the two lines was interrupted for five hours, and there was chaos at the North Station, and accidents occurred in many places along the line.</p>
<p>The authorities certainly cannot be unaware of the employees' difficulties, and they certainly cannot ignore them. If they had given them considerable assistance before the request was launched, so that all or part of the difficulties could be resolved, then from a human perspective, the employees would definitely feel happy, and their work efficiency would inevitably increase. Timely help is the best way to win people's hearts. However, they did not do this. After the request for "emergency relief" was made, they still wanted to delay it. As a result, the employees went on a full-scale slowdown, and traffic on the two railway lines was interrupted for five hours, and so on...</p>
<p>This is just one example of the many events currently happening in our country, and it is a concrete illustration of the Chinese people's disregard for seizing time. You think: When a person's reason is controlled by hunger, what will they do? Will suppression have a thorough effect? What's the use of blaming this or blaming that? The important thing is to face the facts, plan for them in advance, then big things can be turned into small things, and small things can be turned into nothing.</p>
