<h3>打擊失敗主義！</h3>
<p>去年魏德邁將軍來華考察之後，臨行時發表了一篇聲明書，指摘中國的知識份子充滿了失敗主義。這是一句逆耳之言，同時也實在是一句金玉之言。</p>
<p>不錯，我們的知識界是充滿了失敗主義的。這並不是指知識份子的全體，但至少有一掣是滿懷着失收情緒的人。因爲他們抱看失敗主義，所以一切只顧個人，只顧目前，只知發牢騷，只知洩怨憤，不肯爲國家民族的遠大前途着想。豈獨若干知識份子如此，就是社會上許多負有物望的人，也不免若隱若現的抱着失敗主義的情緒。一部份官吏，一有機會，卽陷於貪汚，雖有嚴刑峻罰繩共後，亦所不顧。若干本可有爲的工業家，不肯積極生產，却也在暗中作投機暴利的打算。商人不肯吃辛吃苦的寶遷有無，而動於近利，儘是利用時機從事囤積居奇。敎育文化界人士，往往更以「超然」，「中立」相標榜，逃避現實，放言高論，只求自欺欺人。有些自命爲輿論界的權威者，亦不敢指出威脅國家民族的暴力在什麼地方，危害世界和平的罪魁禍首究是那一幫人，反而唱出糢糊影響的「反內戰」「反封建」「民主」「前進等」空口號。知識靑年則更情緒不安，認不淸自己對未來的世界和自己的國家的遠大責任，只知道對現狀表示不滿，好像整個國家除了他們而外沒有一個人好的，沒有一件事看得入眼，以致一受刺激，卽激起學潮，似乎不惜打倒一切以爲快。而更其不肖的，以尚在學府的「讀書種子」，不知「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂，「却沉溺於燈紅酒綠，酣歌恒舞之中。這些麻醉，茍且，萎靡，逃避，以及衝動，頹廢的種種動態，骨子裏無一不是證明失敗主義在作祟</p>
<p>自然，在智識份子羣中，有不少面對現實，堅忍奮鬥，再接再厲，百折不撓的健者，在爲國家爲民族努力工作，埋頭苦幹，但可惜他們被社坐上普遍失敗主義的風氣所掩罩，而不易爲一般皮相觀察者所認識。</p>
<p>但是在這失敗主義的氣氛中，我們的工人，我們的農民，還在那裏不動聲色，艱苦奮鬥，正和前綫將士與禍國殃民的共匪作殊死戰一樣。其在安全區域，工人在不斷的作工，農人在不斷的耕種，以供應軍民的衣食用品。共在剿匪區域，今日鐵路被破壞了，明日修複通車，今日礦塲工廠被破壞了，明日修復生產。廣大的農村，被共匪騷擾，搜刮，屠殺，裏脅，但農民們於匪來之時，奮力抵抗，匪去之後，又在廢墟上重理故業，積極耕種。他們眞正從事於「建設對破壞」，「生存對死亡」的鬥爭。前面的人倒下去，後面的人站起來，他們從來不曾被失敗主義所征服過，這是中華民族的精神，也是那班充滿失敗情緒的智識份子的榜樣。</p>
<p>誠然，現在有許多知識份子意氣消沉了，頹喪了，或者憤激怨世了，然而我們相信他們的精神終有蹶而復起的一天。在五六十年來中國革命的過程中，新中國建設的過程中，智識份子努力的歷史是光榮的，是站在革命運動與建國工作的領導地位的。從辛亥革命到北伐，以至八年抗戰，乃至一切建設事業，智識份子總是站在第一綫。尤其是抗戰這一段悲壯的歷史，我們身歷其境，記憶猶新。在抗戰的前夕，智識份子那一股激昂慷慨，引滿待發之氣，在抗戰的過程中，智識份子那一種堅苦卓絕、沉着奮鬥的情緒　都是人類最神聖偉大的精神表現。這種表現，足以保證中華民族在昔日能禦侮，在今日能戰亂，而永存於世界。</p>
<p>現在，我們又面臨着「九一八」以後「七七」以前的時代了。外力的虎視，比日本更沉重，也更狡獪。共匪製造內亂，出賣祖國的活動，從軍事的，經濟的，各方面普遍而深入的展開着，甚且製造否定國家民族利益高於一切的謬論以淆惑人心。過去漢奸的「東亞共存共榮」的邪說不足以蒙蔽我們，反而引起我們的憤恨，但今日共匪新漢針的謬論，却如包上了糖衣的毒藥，欺騙天眞爛　的靑年。這是目前眞正的危機所在！可是我們國家民族未來命脈所寄託的敎育家中，竟有若干「學者」以爲他們只負責任販賈知識，對這些現象袖手旁觀，熟視無襯，以迎合自由潮流爲幌子，以保全學閥門第爲目的，非至陷害靑年，葬送國家不止。須知在這國脈民命危急存亡的關頭，我們祗有盡力打擊失敗主義，廓淸失敗情緒，重振我們的精神，正視我們的現實，挺起肩膀，整齊步伐，與惡劣環境奮鬥，爲三民主義新中國的建設而努力，纔可使我們國家民族免於覆亡的命運！</p>
<p>我們深信：黑暗是一時的，光明必將到來。嚴冬旣過，春必降臨。人生是短促的，而民族的生命將傳之永久。我們不應該爲黑暗所苦，而應該懷着滿腔熱血，向光明的前途邁進。我們看，以蔣主席的高年，尙且每天要負擔到十八小時以上的工作，而南北飛馳，席不暇暖，這種積極精神，還不能啟示我們嗎？</p>
<p>主席在元旦指示我們：我們應以三年的時光，戡平匪亂，安定社會。把我們抗戰前夕的精神再振作起來，打擊一切失敗主義，消滅一切腐惡勢力，以迎接此一堅決的昭示，盡我們應盡的責任！</p>

<h3>經濟方案水利部門實施辦法草案要點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕經濟改革方案水利部門實施辦法草案，亦經有關機關擬就，茲誌其要點如次：</p>
<p>根據經濟改革方案與水利建設綱領實施辦法有關條文，並配合客觀環境之需要，水利建設之主要目標爲下述五端，並擬定每五年爲一期，按其輕重緩急，分期實施。</p>
<p>一，關於根治各大河流者：</p>
<p>谷大河流已有治本計劃者，應即由國庫撥款或利用外資開始實施。其治本計劃尙未完成者，應迅速加緊趕辦，限期究成。</p>
<p>實施辦法：1注重全國各大河流根本之治導，以根治水患振興水利。2各大河流之治本計劃，應根據各項資料，就「節」·「普」·「疏」「濬」及整理堤防與河　諸方法詳密考慮勘査規劃比較計而擬定。3治黃最大目標，以防洪及灌溉爲主，輔以水力之開發，與航道之改進；其治本計劃，應積極　　限期完成。4長江治本計劃以航運水力爲主，並顧及洪水之調節及灌溉之利用，其計劃應儘速完成；重要支流應配合規劃探要實施。5淮河應先完成導淮防洪工程，同時配合興辦航運及灌溉工程。6永定河治本計劃應即付實施。7其他主要河道之治本計劃，應分別輕重緩急制定實施。</p>
<p>二，關於興只灌漑者：</p>
<p>全國耕地可能興辦或改良灌溉系統者約二億五千萬市畝。過去政府限於經費，農貸有限，無法大量舉辦，今後除農貨外。應視各省需要情形，准予發行水利公債或另籌其他方法，以裕　源而利進行。實施辦法：（甲）國家撥款舉辦工程。1原有大規模灌溉事業政府應設法加以改進，並積極撥款舉辦新灌溉工程，尤應注意西北各省，第一期五年內舉辦灌溉工程爲　黃河，包括陝甘晋豫　綏寗靑八省，灌溉面積九百九十七萬市畝；　內海，包括甘肅之河西及新疆，共三百六十萬市畝，　白河，包括冀晋豫察四省，共三百三十五萬市畝；　淮河，包括豫魯蘇三省，共四百十一萬市畝；　長江及瀾滄江，包括川康黔滇鄂湘贛皖浙蘇十省，共一千六百零七莫市畝；　遼河，包括遼寗遠北二省，共六十六萬市畝；　松花江，吉林，七十八萬市畝；以上共計三千八百五十四萬市畝，第一年可提前完成一百五十萬市畝。2第一年灌溉工程需款，由政府指撥農田水利基金備用；工程完成後，就受益田畝分年徽收水費歸還本息，以資循環應用。3灌溉工程之審核標準以計畫完善，利益優厚，施工條件便利，完工期限不超過三年者為原則。4工程施工，分由中央主管機關及地方政府負責施工兩種方式辦理。5工程完成後，由地方政府負責管理養護。6利用基金完成之工程，次年出省府負責征收消費。所征用水費，除用作管理養護養外，儘先檄還中央工款，餘作地方農田水利基金。（乙）農田水利貸款舉辦工程。1農行應於卅七年度急需興辦灌溉區域，增撥農田水利貸款，並利用各省縣合作社，普遍推行　井　塘貸款。2各省未完成工程，應加緊趕辦限期完成；已完成者應妥為管理養護。於工程完成後之次年開始還本付息。3貨款手績力求簡單，並從　監督貸款用途。4减低現行貸款利率，使各省普遍興辦灌溉工程。5各省於貸款後，應速籌設健全施工機構，按計劃如限完成。（丙）督飭地方興辦灌溉工程。1地方政府斟酌需要，得請准發行水利公債，作爲地方農田水利基金，並由地方政府組設基金保管委會。2督飭各省縣市政府，利用農閒，發動義務勞動普遍興修灌溉渠　及　井挖塘工程，並舉辦工作競賽。3較大灌溉工程人民不能自力興建，可申請小型農田水利貸款，由地方政府協助進行。4重要灌溉地區設水利工程隊，協導人民，自力與建並酌予貨款。5西北東北華北乾旱區，並着軍　井工程，長江珠江流域，應着重挖塘及抽水機灌溉排水工程。6已完成之工程，應督導受益農戶組水利協會管理養護。</p>
<p>三，關於江河修防者：</p>

<h3>一九四九年美財政預算　杜魯門提出國會　總額四百億元包括援歐曁對華貸欵　塔虎脫表求決予以消減</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕國會共和黨十日已拒絕杜魯門總統之徽稅計劃，以便對十二日提出之預算草案加以攻擊。據消息靈通方面稱：杜魯門請求撥款四百億元以作七月一日起一年度之政府經費。衆院撥款委員會主席泰勃率陳　稱，「此數未免過高」，應予减削。參院共和黨政策委員會主席塔虎脫稱，共和黨將全力减削政府開銷，渠稱：「開銷費用，連馬歇爾計劃在內，必須係「絕對必需者」。</p>

<p>莫氏謂蘇聯共黨正採取新方式的帝國主義，威脅歐洲他國之福利及生活方式。他說：「吾人最願者莫若與蘇合作，以維護和平及促進人類之福利，但吾人對於蘇共宣傳機構對我所施之不實而惡意的攻擊，以及世界各地共黨之自願成為蘇外交部的自動前哨站，實不能永遠置若罔聞。東歐及東南歐諸國逐一被置於不民主而非代表性的政府之下，而其他政黨復備受壓迫，出版自由頻受摧殘，非共黨的政治領袖則遭受非法的處決，吾人對於此種之摧殘民生及人類自由的舉動，不僅深感悲痛，且不禁引起憤慨，更甚者乃爲此等不實的暴力方法，竟以民主自由及社會主義為標榜，尤令人萬分痛心。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕法使館發言人稱，法駐美大使龐納，將於下星期一就德境英美區設立新經濟政權事，向國務院提出口頭抗議。預料龐納將吿知國務院以法國政府認爲在法英美三國在柏林討論德境三國佔領區合併之可能性以前，英美不得就德西部單獨成立決議，此間外交界人士深恐法國之抗議，將耽懊柏林之談判而損及其成功之希望。</p>

<p>靑年學子是社會國家未來的棟樑，他們是處處需要人們的援助的。但是在這艱困的局勢中，雖是多數人覺得生計困難，在另一方面我們很淸楚的看到，還有無數有錢的人，還在過着窮奢極侈的生活，他們每天所耗費的錢，就足够一個大學生整年的費用。我們決定從今天起，再度向讀者諸君徽募助「學金」，以便在下學期開始的時候，搶救無數的失學靑年。</p>
<p>我們希望熱心的續者，多多給予清寒學子援助。例如逢到喜慶的酬酢，不妨從節約上着想，省下些錢來，捐作助學金。尤其是工商各業的「集體捐助」，更是衆警易舉，最所歡迎。總之有力出力，有錢出錢。其效果正是殊途而同歸。—（捐款請本報社會服務科）</p>

<h3>兩航空公司急電交部　對油價請作有效控制</h3>
<p>據悉三家汽油公司，於本月一日曾將航空汽油價格提高百分之十，昨又通知中國及中央公司，自昨日起，復提高百分之廿二。按開年以來，飛機票價並未調整，而飛機用油於旬日之內，兩度上漲，使航空公司頗感不勝負担。（按航空公司現須以收入百分之卅五付油價）尤以其隨時漲價時間與數量毫無限制，使航空公司有無從準備之苦。昨兩公司已急電交通部俞部長·中央銀行張總裁，請速謀有效之控制，否則航空運價受油價上漲之刺激，勢須隨時調整，結果影響一般物價上漲，互相循環，影響國民經濟，其惡果不　想　云。</p>

<h3>漁業團體座談會痛陳危機迫眉睫　漁管處鮮魚應製成乾鹹魚銷售</h3>
<p>上海漁業同業公會，上海市漁輪業同業公會籌備處，上海市漁會，全國漁業公司聯合辦事處，浙江水產建設協會，上海漁市塲經紀人同業公會六團體，爲農林部漁業司司長劉發煊，參事候潮海，顧問蔣偉之等來滬，會同上海市政府。江浙漁業督導處調查聯應漁輪與民營漁業糾紛問題，及當前全國漁業危機，廠結所在，加以檢討提供意見，用備政府採擇起見，特於昨日下午二時，在九江路二一〇號三〇二室，召開漁業緊急座談會，到有各單位代表三十餘人，由全國漁聯處理事陸養浩任主席，對目前漁業界</p>
<p>困苦處境　　有所陳述，並指出聯總漁輪與民營漁業糾紛　結所在。渠稱：聯總利用西文作宣傳攻勢，企以烟幕掩飾其特權地位，聯總漁輪捕魚，致市塲供應過剩。勝利後，我同業擁有廿八對漁輪之生產單位，每艘產量近千二百箱左右，較戰前超過五百餘箱，供應滬市</p>
<p>需要已足</p>
<p>卌五年七月聯總輪到滬，至卌六年九月，聯總有四十六艘漁船出海，初意原擬以救濟資金從事有冷藏設施，製造漁業機械，建設我漁業，今則致全力於捕魚，竟將漁獲物集中上海一埠傾銷，陷我漁業界生存於不願，目前狀況，諒非聯合國救濟原意。再漁管處以「大家吃便宜魚」為口號，掩飾其出海捕魚，茲</p>
<p>舉例爲證</p>
<p>該處於卅六年十一月捕魚三十五萬斤，共得價款三十億元，然漁管處開支月須一百五十億元，以钜大經費捕得區區數額，則其魚價平均每斤幾何，實　鷩人。繼由黃振世，朱文奎，胡筆峰等發表意見，最後田各代表一致主張，對於目前鮮魚生產，本市各民營公司，已足够供應民食，至政府規定漁管處每月在市場銷魚五十萬斤，應將該項鮮魚，予以加工製成幹鹹魚，分銷各地，符合該處所提普遍供應廉價民食之原則。</p>

<h3>爪哇內地僑胞　遭遇淒厲的命運</h3>
<p>〔本報吧城六日航訊〕自從本年七月廿一日，印荷談判破裂，雙方搆兵以來，爪哇內地華僑的生命，彷彿如風中殘燭，釜底游魂，東坡「夢繞雲山心似鹿，魂飛湯火命如雞」那兩句詩，恰好道出今日爪哇內地華僑淒慘的處境。據粗略的統計：華僑直接或間資遭受此次戰禍損失，被殘殺的不下數千，變成難民的總數已達十萬以上。僅就是惹（印尼首都）而論，日前已有六千，梭羅也有五千之多。</p>
<p>中華難民所</p>
<p>爪哇內地華僑，是一脈相承的大度泱泱，勸儉安分，或事勞作，或營工商，無不恪守法紀，絕無政治意味，論其貫獻，實大有裨於當地之繁榮。爪哇一島，華僑多至六十餘萬人，一向與印尼人相處，和睦無問，試看華印通婚之多，便可想見。爪哇能有今日的地位，華僑披荆斬棘之功，實不容抹煞。洎自日寇投降印尼狹窄的民族主義抬頭，一般自命為建國興邦的武人，師法日寇統治期間的暴政，「　規曹隨」，作爲印尼新國家施政的綱領。同時，也有不少日寇頭目，潛入印尼軍政各機關，實行其幕後工作，推波助瀾，挑撥離間，明槍啫箭，一齊出動，至令華印雙方密切之感情，遭受中傷，結果誠實安分之萬千華僑，亦不能受到生命財產的保障，慘殺田人，刧掠由人，寗不令人悲憤！</p>
<p>皇皇的命令</p>
<p>今日爪哇內地僑胞，不要說住在窮鄕僻　的小埠，得不到印尼政府的保護，即號稱印尼共和國的首都日惹，和印尼共和國心臟的梭羅，也根本談不上有什麽保障。</p>
<p>鈕副領事壽椿，這次奉命派駐日惹，內地華僑得了這偶喜訊，好像天涯遊子，一旦逢了多年不見的爹娘，悲喜交集，把鈕副領事當作「福星」「菩薩」一樣地歡迎招待。即印尼共和政府，對於堂堂大中華民國的外交使领駐節京華，也引為莫大的光榮，印尼政府不敢簡慢嘉賓，特指定尼梭尼卡山街八號情緻雅潔的屋宇，作為鈕氏的官舍。本月初，鈕副領事因視察僑情，出巡各埠，官舍裹還放下許多文件衣服用具，而且上着鎖，誰料得到，剛剛離開日惹，鈕氏的住宅就被由瑪琅前綫歸來的印尼少校硬搬進去住了。共和政府的招待官，特向該少校辦交涉，反給少校臭駡一頓，絲毫沒有辦法。後來那位招待官聽說鈕副領事快耍回日惹了，急得他手忙脚亂，繞室徬徨，只好鬧到堂堂的內閣總理沙里孚粦跟前去，由沙氏親下手令，叫那位少校搬開”結果，他睬也不睬。最後沙氏情急智生，改用國防部長的名義下令搬遷，那位少校同樣的理也不理。據說沙氏還親自去察着，那位少校仍舊很傲慢的佔據着那個官舍，堂堂內閣總理，一點奈何他不得，只得掉頭便走，趕忙商借同僑李則成君的威嚴，還不能使下級軍官服從最低限度的紀律，中華民國的領事官邸，尙被武人橫霸佔，文武大臣，碰也不敢碰。我們還敢奢望尼政府，有什麼能力保護我們華僑的生命財產嗎？</p>
<p>儘管我們的外交官，在安全理事會控訴印尼暴徒殘殺華僑，儘管蘇加諾總統，沙里孚粦總理，蘇第曼大將頒發保獲華僑的命令，儘管排華最力的馬斯友美黨的主席，（即前任內政部長）倫姆氏，對我們記者說：我們現在每星期，都派了高級幹部人員，到鄕村去宣傳華印親善的主張，儘管在首都的日惹市區，高懸一幅我們國父孫中山先生這歷史巨人的畫像，兩旁還大書特書這樣的語句：「三民主義，主張扶助小民族的獨立」。可是，華僑的生命仍舊得不到絲亳的保障，直到現在，我們從沒聽見過印尼政府，曾經逮捕或斃過一個殘殺華僑搶刧華僑的印尼暴徒。</p>
<p>一幅流民圖</p>
<p>寫積至此，忽有一位別了八年的友人林君來訪，他是剛從芝沙丹尼對岸逃亡出來的，據林君說：「巴隆班　」芝力節，打路，登約，馬夜，芝古耶，芝德拉斯，沙常岸，耶隔哇夜，渣公，等地的華僑，約四千人，被印尼人驅住冷加士勿凍，只准携帶一物一衣，被集中於芝約洛，及那林望等地的荒山曠野之中，與毒蛇猛獸惡蚊　伍，山中向無人烟，爲避雨遮日計，難僑乃搜集樹葉，搭成草亭，暫作退休之所。最可體的，是那林旺的難僑，衣服早經破碎不堪，即麻袋蔽身亦苦不易得，過的完全是「原始人」的生活！」</p>
<p>爪哇內地物資缺乏到了極點，我們華商殘存下來的一點一滴的貨物與用具，便被印尼人在「集中」，「軍用」，「官用」的名裘下給充了公。華僑的工廠和精緻的住宅，都給徵用完了。據可靠消息：梭羅，勿里達的華僑工廠和住家，印尼人都埋好了炸藥，準備荷軍再來一次「衛行動」時，即實行「焦土」政策。誰敢保證戰火不會重開？誰能信任印尼政府有　歷不良份子的本領？誰會妄想印尼的陸軍首腦部有控制一切武武團體的能力？</p>
<p>吧城華僑總會，不斷的向世界廣播印尼暴徒殘害華僑的事實，促請全世界有正義感的人士，和印尼政府本身，應正視現實，共起制裁。照我們身處安全地區的人想，爪哇內地華僑，聽了這個播音，該多麽感激與與奮呀！可是，相反的，身處「危邦」的僑胞們，一致要求吧城華總的廣播，應極力避免含有刺激性的詞句，以防印尼人動了肝火，使內地僑胞大大吃虧，做人家出氣的對象。最近爪哇內地華僑流行有兩句極沉痛的話：「站在天堂上的華僑，說話時也該替地獄裏的人們想想啊！」（特約記者黃海震）</p>

<h3>九龍木屋拆毀以後　慘哉僑胞！寄身何處？</h3>
<p>〔本報香港七日航訊〕九龍事件經兩月來的交涉，而港府卒於五日上午動員警察與工人執行拆卸城內民居後，港中僑報對我外交當局交涉不力，頗多憤慨，而對港府在雙方依循外交途徑進行交涉中而突有此不愉快之舉，亦表示十分　憾。港中僑報這次似已盡了最大力量，在一個特殊環境下發揮。</p>
<p>與論精神</p>
<p>為百萬僑衆一抒胸中的抑　。國民日報六日即以「楚雖三戶，亡秦必楚！」為題，發表正論，作為對九龍居民的寄語。</p>
<p>「在昨天的報章上，看到緬甸宣佈脫離英國統治，正式成爲獨立國家的輝煌消息，但同時也看到「香港武裝警察大規模出動，督拆九龍城木屋」的惡劣新聞，相形之下，眞使人有哭笑不得，莫明其妙之感！」這是工商日報六日社論的第一段。星島日報以「外交的犧牲者」爲題，對事件作一般的檢討後，結論稱：「朱沛堂·劉毅失兩位先生，爲了國權和芳鄰的利益，挺身站在前面，甘冒危險，至堪欽佩，我們談致崇敬的慰問之意，幷望港府勿以普通的違警犯視之。</p>
<p>中英邦交</p>
<p>終歸要敎睦，應　可能減少足以損傷感情的因素，把眼光放遠點看，中國人的友誼，無論如何，究竟是値得珍惜的」其對港府的忠吿，眞可說是語重心長了。</p>
<p>新生晚報「慰九龍城居民」那篇社論，對我外交當局頗多不滿，該報說：「他們本來是祖國的同胞，從今天起，他們已是海外的僑胞了！當灰飛　頹之會，他們自然會感到「最後一課」的心情，這心情，我們是深切了解的，我們不能怨人而祗能自怨我們的外交官！……我們頋向政府呼竄，必須要珍惜海外</p>
<p>僑胞內向</p>
<p>之心！僑胞之內向，其首要之條件是國家給予他們以保護，這保護的責任，無論大小，在僑胞看來是極度感廄的！」</p>
<p>六日下午，九龍城的民居，已遭完全拆毁，昔日家家戶戶，頓成一片荒圩，許多流離失所的居民，瑟縮於頹垣斷瓦之中，四無遮攔，寒風砭骨，有婦女多人，產期剛渡，面無血色，手抱幼嬰，徘徊山頭，不知今夕寄身何處？這是義民，祖國對他們怎能予以忽視。（特約記者子健）</p>
<h3>故都一疑案　利用法律的罅隙推事被停職查辦</h3>
<p>〔本報北平日航訊〕行憲開始的第二天，北平便發生了一樁玩弄法律致人於死的疑案，玩法者太聰明了，看來天衣無縫，不想反被一位蠢笨的執法者弄出了破綻主辦的推事等已被停職査辦。北平人正極感興趣的注意這一疑案的發展。</p>
<p>〔截至今天（六日）爲止，此案經過是這樣：一個多月以前北平的刑事警官隊根據楊梅竹斜街同發生銀號經理寗文軒的控吿，捉護了所謂「勒贖擄人」的犯人利華金店經理任國瑞，王蘊華，宋仁浩，及二個退伍憲兵田湯池，田慶榮。刑警隊旋將一干人犯移送北平地方法院，承辦此案的推事林幹</p>
<p>一審定讞</p>
<p>原定本月二日正午十二時宣判，屆時遲遲不見法官，直到五時要下班了，承辦此案的林推事還不見出來，而由另一位書記官朱承鈴怱忽出來，代理出庭，拿出了縐成一團的判決書宣佈了宋仁浩的死刑，其他四人無期徒刑。消息傳出，與論大譁，各報指摘此案大有疑問，根據判決書所述事實，係宋仁浩曾介紹其姑母劉王氏以黃金一百十餘兩，貸與本市利華金店，該店總經理任國瑞，經理王蘊華，店友張鶴鳴，則以之轉貨與本市同發長銀號及該號經理陳澤民。　因該號於三十六年五月間倒閉，經理陳澤民逃亡，債務正待股東淸算，宋仁浩任國瑞王蘊華與在逃之張鶴鳴，以債權損失堪處，乃共謀綁擄該號總經理寗文軒，意國勒　，三十六年十月二十一日午後九時許，先由宋仁浩任國瑞二人雇汽車請寗文軒出外，另夥由田湯池田慶榮二人冒充憲兵，手持偽造恐嚇信一封，預伏北兵馬司胡同東口　截，聲稱寗文軒爲共黨邊區銀行經理，因有人吿發，特來辦，須將寗文軒事實我憲兵隊等語相恐嚇。旋由寧仁浩偽裝代為請恕，乃共同將寗文軒擄至香餌胡同新安里六號，宋仁浩所有之空房內。</p>
<p>勒索贖款</p>
<p>一億元，因無現款，乃迫令簽立借欠忠義堂名下國幣一億元之字據，並由宋仁浩以電話招王總華張鶴鳴至，須迫令簽立借欠宋仁浩名下黃金二百八十兩之字據一紙，由任國瑞宋季氏於翌日持往北兵馬司十八號寗宅，要求加蓋舖保，允將寗文軒送回，但不允吿知寗文軒所在。十一月一日，宋仁浩任國瑞王蘊華張鶴鳴復先後將寗文軒移至東皇城根七號宋仁浩住所，前外延壽寺街花枝胡同二十二號張宅，同日午後又移回宋宅，再次迫令簽立以其所有北兵馬司十八號房屋担保償付黃金二百八十兩之抵押契據一紙，始將寗文軒釋回，案經北平市警察局査獲，在偵査中，復據自訴人提起自訴到院。」</p>
<p>但根據被吿所供，則是原吿故意做成的圈套，　他們掉了進去。原來寗曾說：「各股東不肯輕易拿錢，應當用假意扣人的辦法威脅我，給各股東君，他們就肯出錢了。「一切都是設定的圈套，利用法律漏隙。</p>
<p>陷人於罪　　宋仁浩被捕後，警察告訴他是寗文軒告了他，宋還說：「寗五爺，我們有師生之誼，那能吿我？」</p>
<p>此案被社會論指摘的是：　宋　是當有資　者，不會是綁架勒贖的匪犯，而况他是寗的債權人。　寗有姑母寗樹　在地院任林幹推事的書記官，寗是律師高學敏亦有子博生任候補推事。　判刑鍋重。</p>
<p>果然，與論發生了力量，督察團首先派員段木且，五日冀高院下令所有嫌疑者，推事林幹，警記官寗樹華，朱　鈐，全被停職澈查。</p>
<p>此案尙在發展中，容後讀報。（記者宋紹柏）</p>

<p>〔本報長沙七日航訊〕湘省府秘書處人事室主任周臨之套講湘救濟分署油毛毡三百餘捲一案，眞相業經大白。緣三十大年七月間湘救濟分署公吿招售油毛毡訂價每捲國幣一十四萬元，每人限購二十捲，並先期塡具購售申請書，其購買入如係普通平民，則須當地保甲證明，如係公務人員，則須服務機關證明，當時人事室科員張鶴齡等十六人，各就所需，分別塡具由請書各一份，一併送請湘救分署洽購。經核定後，向銀行繳款領取收款通知書，再至救署簽發提貨通知單，始到儲運站提貨。惟爾時湘救分署以張鶴齡等係同一機關服務，爲簡化手續，僅以張鶴齡等簽發總通知單，故提貨時亦僅張鶴齡一人蓋章，提出後再行分發各本人。詎料日前湘救分署以亥冬代電附抄配發省縣市各機關救濟物資數量表，送達省府會計處時，誤將張鶴齡等私購之油毛毡列爲配發）秘書處之數，其備考欄內附註「帳篷十件未發」字樣，會計處比以亥删代電轉達秘書處行查，致引起各方誤會，以爲配發秘書處之物資係被少歡職員所套領，又以張鶴齡係人事室職員，主任周臨之同鄕，致誤爲周臨之盜購。當時秘書長劉公武一時亦不明內情，大為震怒，旋輕省府派員赴救濟分署澈査，確爲私人價購，案情乃吿大白。惟張鶴齡等動用秘書處印章，以作證明服務機關，事前未報吿秘書長，殊屬不合，劉秘書長正在追究將予處分。</p>

<h3>極光</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>世界就是一個產生或蘊藏神秘的地方，那裏存在着許多使人不可捉摸或推測的事物。從使其中也還生長有一種自稱智慧的人們，然而對於他們自己的來源問題，至今無法回答。或者他們會推到迭物身上去不過造物本身也成問題，於是袛有委諸神秘了。</p>
<p>極光是神秘的東西，但看那摺曲的姿態，奇艷的色彩，眞可稱爲萬紫千紅，百般妖麗，幕乘天壁，綽約多姿，像落日時　美的流霞，又如太空中繞了一條彩帶。</p>
<p>瑞典，那威，加拿大及阿拉斯加等地，時常有北極光的奇觀出現，並且發生的次數並不如想像的那樣少。普通人都認爲極光的發現，一定要至南北兩極。事實上並不如此，因爲我們知道地磁是有　動的，這種地磁的變遷，用普通的磁針測驗，如與某地成　直，於是那個地方就是磁極地，而這種地磁變更的引起，原由太陽中的黑點而來。但極光本因地磁而發生的，所以極光訂以隨南地磁而移位。</p>
<p>極光不但是在色彩上表現出它的美，而形狀上亦極奇特。最普通的一種形狀，大致如螺旋，有時並無色彩發出，祗有光芒流射，閃燦曜目，有時五彩交呈，華　萬分，大部份的位置，是固定的，小部分却在上下左右的快速跳動，好像彈簧受力而彈動向上，並且發出一種如針狀　光，長短不一，沾着主帶的上　，濃淡參差，高低均宜。還有一種形狀　扇面的，又像皇冠式的，惟通常不易見到。而此種形式的極光，或比前者更動人，但是可惜這種極光的發生，常在極高的空中，大約在六百哩以上，普通人目恐怕不易淸晰看見。</p>
<p>從前一般人都認爲極光是一種不可測而且玄妙異常的現　象正好像見了日蝕的情形一樣。據現在一般從事硏究極光的科家，由觀察和探討而得到了兩種理論：一種是以太陽所幅射出來的光綫，波長極短，也就是一種輻射波能，如紫外錢等，而高空大氣　比較稀薄，極易和此種短波的射綫撞擊，而其本身成游離，即帶有電荷的質點。這些由各種氣體分子所集合成的一大　質點，是被短波射綫之能而使其帶電。吾人假定氫原十係由一個核即質子及其周圍之一個電子所構成，令其在眞空管中外通以高電壓，使氣在此管中放電而發生光。現在且設想核外電子可以拈許多一定之能平面　飛述運動，自核起將此種能平面分成數曆，分別爲一·二·三·四·五等氫原子，平時在正常狀　時，電子在第一　上，但經能加在原子上，此時氫即在眞空管中放電，於是第一　那一個電子，就躍入外層較高之能平面或竟完全躍出原子外，氫則成爲氫游子，即所謂游離如於此時將外加之能立即去掉則電子即由較高之能平面回入於內層，如此電子由較高能平面跳入較低之能平面時，外加之能，即釋出轉變成爲光。能層之降落愈大，則發光之消長也愈短，紫外錢之成因也在此。現在我們明白了光之生成，於是也就不難知道氣體游離，而生成極光的道理。</p>
<p>還有一種理論，是直接由太陽發出高能的帶電質點，其速度很大，大槪一種有一千哩，這麽高速的質點，很可能被極弱的磁塲所偏轉，所以這些質點　在離地球很遠的地方，就生成極光，然後再沿着磁力錢下來，愈接近地面，則質點發前受的磁力愈强，於是其偏轉程度也愈大，故極光就被形成底盤很大，面上頂尖小的螺旋形。極光的高度最低者有四十五哩，最高達六百哩，極光又能影響無綫電通訊，因爲氣體的游離能發生與導電體同樣的性質，並且能使照相乾片感光，由此可以測得其高度與距離。</p>

<h3>原子時代的原素　鐠94</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>分離鈾的司素體中存在着的困難，像缺乏各種性質上的分別，重量的極端近似等，也都解決了；就因爲是另外的一個原素，在化學性和物理性二方面都和鈾有着不同點，因此可能地比較　單的方法來獲得。</p>
<p>可是那時候，用擊破機產生的鐠實是太少了。幾星期的工作，不過給我們幾微克（Wicro·gram）的鐠而已。要知道，一克是二十八分之一盎斯，一微克則是一百萬分之一克，約相當於三萬五千萬分之一盎斯；人肺裏的空氣容量是二十五萬微克，也將將十萬倍於那時鐠的樣品，我們常可想見他的少了。</p>
<p>不過科學家是不會氣餒的，在一九四二年的秋季，旗寗（Cunnigham）和韋南（Weruer）稱出了第一個純　監的重量，而在年尾，更得到了五百微克的純鐠監。這還是不足蓋沒一個釘子的頭的，但在鐠的研究上，正是非凡地重要；靠了這些微的收獲，才能開始龐大的研究工作。而有田納西州克林頓（Clinton　Teun）的鐠分離工塲（Plutonium-Seperationplant）的建立。</p>
<p>因爲現代科學中有硏究微最物質的方法。那使是探跡化學（Tracer　Chemiotry）。他們用盡戈的計數器來簡接地從微量鐠和他種元素化合物同時存在的溶液　測得放射性而推其性質;用精密的脈動分析機來探測放射元素的質點速度以分別各種放射質點。更用各種精細的儀器，天平，容器來記錄他的重量，和作各種實驗。因此，微量的物質，也依舊可以用來作各種試驗的。</p>
<p>科學家更進一步的改造探跡化學而成立一種更精密的方法，那便是超微　化學(Ultra-Microchemistry），他們把微量（Micro-Chemistry）的一切技術和方法再度地縮小精密度重量用微量天平（Micro-balance）稱得，加熱和沈　在微電　，微坩鍋和微管。加州大學實驗室，最　敏的天平，可以稱出一微克的物質而錯誤不及百分之一。</p>
<p>結果使人類充分地明瞭了鈾鐠分開的化學作用，取得縉的純化物。也熟悉了一切的性質。</p>
<p>進一步的擴大，就使第一個製造鐠的原子堆（Pile）能在華盛頓州的漢福特（Hanlordi　Washington）工作，分出了　而製成原子炸彈。</p>
<p>克林頓工塲的司麥斯教授（Prof．Smyth）曾有一個詳綱的報吿，從那裏我們可以知道鐠在原子堆裏是一條純鈾棒，經過許多混礙土造成的地下室，那就是稱爲「夾谷」（Cauyon）的。每一部分有需要的熔解池，沈　池，和攪擾器（Centrifuges）。而發生再三的變化，熔解，沈學作用，而在　後分出鐠來。</p>
<p>科學家在一九四四年已完成了製造鐠量比他們作實騐　取得的十萬萬倍大的規模。和達到損失不到百分之二十的地步。一九四五年的夏天，漢福特城製鐠工塲更達到了相當完美的境界，能產生足够的鐠以作爲原子炸彈的原料。</p>
<p>但是科學家所希望鐠能眞正做到爲人福利的地步，前途正還有重重的艱難。要達到每天二磅的目的，眞不知還要費多少心力。</p>
<p>司麥斯敎授的計劃，就是希望能得到每天二磅的產量，以從此獲得五十萬至一千五百萬旺的電能。這巨大的動力。</p>
<p>站在經濟的立塲上看，如果每　電以美金三分計算，每月就可省刦二千二百萬美元的燃煤得到的電力。</p>
<p>在動力廠的觀點上，那供電量的充沛，要比世界大的大古力（Crand　Coulec）水閘所能運用水力發生的電量，更要　足。（續完）</p>

<h3>補充數字分節的漢化</h3>
<p>— 張子采</p>
<p>讀三十六年十二月廿二日。本刊第廿一期所載周實民君所撰：「數字分節的漢化」一文，所言即數學中之「命數法」（Numerotion），亟宜改進，鄙人甚表贊同且早有記戰，記在私人册中，然遲遲未敢發表。今據舊記，特爲局君補充之。考淸季德淸俞曲園先生所著雜纂，有「通李』一文，蓋疏通元季李仁卿所作之「古今　」也。李於算學極有硏究，多引國語及韋昭註　，而曲園以李所說爲古數，與今數不同。今數者，即指淸季當時所用之命數法也。今我民國之命數法，似接淸季之舊，而排演阿拉伯數字算式多遵西法，以三位加一撇（，）。然我國今數之命數法之排演，實四位爲一檔。但政府對於現行之數爲三位，而於舊時命數爲四位爲不合，早已有鑒於此，曾於民國二十年六月間，由敎育部頒布通令，在記數名詞未確定前，將算學中有歧義之「億」，「兆」等字，暫行取消，所右萬以上之數目，即在「萬」字以上，累冠數字，如十萬·百萬·千萬·萬萬·十萬萬·百萬萬等，而曲園所述，本有兩表，一爲古數，一爲今數，古數者以十「萬」爲「億」，十「億」爲「兆」，當時已不適用，今不追述。今錄今數表於后：</p>
<p>一　十一爲十　十十爲百　十百爲千</p>
<p>十千爲萬　十萬爲十萬　百萬爲百萬　千萬爲千萬</p>
<p>萬萬爲億　十億爲十億　百億爲百億　千億爲千億</p>
<p>萬億爲兆　十兆爲十兆　百兆爲百兆　千兆爲千兆</p>
<p>萬兆爲經　十經爲十經　百經爲百經　千經爲千經</p>
<p>萬經爲咳　十咳爲十咳　百咳爲百咳　千咳爲千咳</p>
<p>今政府旣早有通令，則此表似已不適用今日，近來數日，愈演愈大，鄙人嘗見人以億開支票時，曾即吿以政府之令，認用「億」字爲不合法令。嗣問諸專於會計事業者，　「億」字可用，曾有通令，然鄙人疏忽，未之見也。考西文名稱，以百萬爲「密林」（Million），以十萬萬爲「別林」（Billion），今如周君所舉，六十三億九千萬之數，照今三位爲檔寫之如下。。</p>
<p>十億　億　千萬　百萬　十萬　萬　千　百　十　一</p>
<p>6,390,000,000.</p>
<p>若照四位為檔寫之如下：</p>
<p>十億　億　千萬　百萬　十萬　萬　千　百　十　一</p>
<p>63,9000,0000.</p>
<p>別　密</p>
<p>林　林</p>
<p>由此觀之，周君所言三點，　可避免不規則的記憶;　改良後有助於科學通俗化；　我們不能永遠隨着人的觀念，應該努力自奮，些二點甚有意義，鄙人極爲贊同，故特爲補充之。</p>
<p>又我國算數之命數名稱，考各書所載，皆據徐岳所著「數術記遺」一編，其名稱爲「一·十·百·千·萬·億·兆·京·垓·秭·稪·溝·　·正·載」等字，自「億」字爲始，至「載」字爲十位，再上則又有「恒河沙」「無量數」等名稱。</p>
<p>曲國之表，以「京」爲「經」，以「核」爲「咳」，亦作「姟」，其所述雖皆右根據，然不若徐岳所記之名稱爲通俗。吾想政府於最短期內，當有命數之令也。</p>
<p>曲園分古數與今數兩種，或云命數法分三等，一爲曲園古數，一爲曲國今數，而另一以萬萬爲「億」，億億爲「兆」者，今不適用，故不詳述，然學者不可不知。</p>
<h3>地球年齡機何？</h3>
<p>— 張長慶</p>
<p>地球究有多大年紀了？這　有　的問題以前也有過許多推测。硏究古生物　的專家說：人類已有五萬年歷史了，如果以人猿時代也計算在內，足足有數十萬年，所以地球的年齡約在百萬年左右。</p>
<p>地質學家研究各種的岩石，繼產，火山的結果，覺得地球上最老的岩石，已有二萬萬年了。</p>
<p>又有人根據積聚在海　　負類骨灰的多少，證明海　早在幾萬萬　　前，就有生物了。但在沒有生物之前，究竟地球已存在了多少年，却無從知道，沒有準確的計算。</p>
<p>現在爲了大家研究原子彈，對原子彈原料鈾　　鋼等稀金屬，大家都注意起來，已經有人發現每一兩鈾在四十五萬萬年之後，會只剩半兩。其餘半兩就變了鉛，這種鉛和普通的鉛有些兩樣了，可以鑒別出來。現在從鈾鑛中算出這種鉛的成分，和　的成分一比較，這可算出一個年分來。</p>
<p>但奇怪得很，雖然鈾鑛石年齡各有不同，可是，算出來的答案總是十九億九千萬年，這樣計算地球的年齡，常然是準確得多了。</p>
<h3>嗅覺的新研究</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>在我們的幾種甫要感覺中，對嗅覺是最後一種被人了解的，多少年來科學曾絞盡腦汁來解剖，試驗以期找出鼻子有嗅覺的來源，結果都未成功。反之，這個神秘的東西倒代香料商人大大的賺了金錢。一九四七年十一月底美國耶魯大學的柏克（Dr．Lloyd　H．Beck）和邁爾士（Dr．Walter　R．Miles）二博士經過多年的研究和試驗後，現在發表了關於鼻子嗅覺一套極新穎的理論。一般人和過去的生理學家總相信鼻子是一個化學試騐室，用化學分折方法去鑑別氣味，其實這是大錯而特錯的。鼻子原來是種儀器，專用來測量被有氣味的氣體所吸收去的紅外錢（Infra-redrays）的。</p>
<p>科學家早就知道有氣味的氣體可以吸收一定波長的紅外綫。在工業上曾利用這種現象去鑑別氣體；而化學家也常把紅外綫放射到有氣味的氣體中去，覜察這種氣體吸收紅外錢後的一些物理反應。由此導使柏邁二博士認爲嗅覺與紅外錢一定有關係，經過多年試驗終久證明了他們的理想是對的。</p>
<p>他們曾收集了許多試驗數據（Data），研究出紅外綫的波長在七·五一萬分之一公分與一四一萬分之一公分之問的都會被有氣味氣體吸收，無氣味的氣體毫無反應。而恰巧人體在普通溫度下輻射出的熟波大部份的波長是在這一範圍內。那麽嗅覺怎樣發生的呢？在鼻孔中，有一個「氣味接收器」橫在氣流通道中，中含特別細胞。在細胞周圍的組織比較的溫度很低，所以這些熱細胞就輻射熱波到周圍組織中去，活像一座小的廣播電台才發送電波似的。當純粹的空氣流過這通道時，細胞毫無反應，輻射熱彼的速率也無變化，假定有氣味的氣體流過通道，牠馬上吸收了一部分細胞放出的熱波，輻射的速率勢必加大因而刺激細胞起一種特殊反應，這就是嗅覺。</p>
<p>爲了證實這個理論，柏邁二傳士先用蟑螂來作試驗，因爲蟑驟的嗅覺是由露在體外的觸聚來祖任的。他們在一個選蔽很密不透氣的窗十外面放出最能誘感蟑螂的丁香花油的蒸氣，牠在窗子內面就會嗅到這氣味，盡力想衝出窗子外面去;原因是牠的觸鬃上輻射的紅外綫可以透射過這窗子。若把窗子換成一個使紅外綫透不過的玻璃板隔在當中，牠就一點也沒嗅到，毫無衝動。同樣用蜜糖去引誘蜜蜂也得到這個結果。牠們的觸鬃露在外邊，可以把熱波放射到遠方，使嗅覺到達極遠的距離。</p>
<p>人類的鼻子構造複雜，現在尙不能試驗，整個的嗅覺儀器是深埋在鼻子內部，無法把細胞輻射出的紅外錢用人工去吸收，柏克和邁爾士二博士宜稱只耍他們能得到一架紅外綫分光計，就可以試騐了。</p>
<p>這個富有革命性的新穎理諭，顯然還需要科學家更深的硏究和最多的試騐，才能確定其價値，如果確實是這樣的話，那在科學中文創建了一門新科學——嗅覺光譜學（Smelling　Spectroscopy）。將來科學家可以使兩種不同氣味的氣體化合而產生能吸收另有一定波長的熱波，即生出第三種新氣味來，使我們的鼻子多得些幸福。關於這些研究和試騐，兩三年前，謠言就傳到那些狐狸似的香料商人耳朶中，目前他們正極力設法得到這種研究的完全報吿，企圖去製造世界上最新最能誘惑男女兩性的香料。</p>
<h3>放射性同位素　最新原子藥的產生</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>震驚世界的原子能，除了原子炸彈給予我們威　和恐怖外，也給我們無限的能量和有希望的新藥醫藥家的研究已經確切證明甲狀腺癌和甲狀腺機能過繳症（Hyperthyroidism）可用放射性碘來治療。造血組織的癌症和赤血球增多症（Polycythemia）　可以放射性磷來治療。美國最近開始將它的原子智職與世界共享，杜魯門總統宣稱可以為外國科學家供給放射性同位素（Radioactive　Isotopes）以便共同對付疾病，增進人類福利。不久以前有一架專機載送亞磷卅二，送到澳洲畢爾缽（Melbourne）的國立X光與　錠實騐室應用。</p>
<p>同位素就是同元素而重量不同的原子。我們知道在一個典型原子裏，電子團燒於一個核的周圈，在核中間有兩種分子，一種具有正的電荷，稱爲陽電子，另一種並無電荷，稱爲中子·當原子以中子撞擊時，中子若被核所吸收，就形成同位素。這元素在化學上與生物學上的性質，均屬不變，但它的重量已發生變化。</p>
<p>某些同位素是不穩定的，它們的核心破裂而放出類似光的放射能，因而產生了放射性。舉例說鈾二三五（原子炸彈的起點）的核中具有九十二個陽電子和一百四十二中子，帶有爆炸性。</p>
<p>某種元素的放射性同位素猶如　微鏡，它們一入入體，即放射出一種可以記錄的能，由此我們可以明白看出它在人體內的過程和變化。例如一種含有同位素的糖，吃了之後，在消化系統內如何旅行？如何變化？如何變成工作的能力？都可以追溯指示出來。</p>
<p>專家們說放射性原素的廣泛使用，也許可以帮助解釋人體怎樣變得　老，由此可以明瞭許多迄未制服的疾病。有些同位素停留在某些組織內，發出短程的放射作用，用以消滅癌症以及惡瘤，不再需要開刀。</p>
<p>到目前為止，有九十六種問位素　已產生。他們的用途正待科學家去研究和利用，這些原子　一定會給予人們幸福和健康。</p>

<h3>出賣殘忍</h3>
<p>— 季庸</p>
<p>通日有人論及冬賑及捐棉衣，頗有所感。恰好今天出外，在我所住的一條雖然名日大都市而實在　得像猪欄狗窠的街道上，除去隨地可以遇到的在「內有水龍頭，禁止小便」的牆脚下，嘩啦嘩啦　個不歇的人們外，便是擴塞不通的菜　。穿行於這爛泥淖似的人羣中的，是一個四十多歲的呌化子，拖了一個裝有小輪的板車，上面臥着一具有似僵屍的中年漢，兩條腿沒有了，只有一段肉棒伸在外面，另外一個年靑一點的人，用喑啞的喉嚨在呌喚着，要求別人給他們同情。我即使還有點惻　之心，可是不知爲何，一見了道窮凶極惡的表演，也只好瞥然而過，不敢伸出「憐憫之手」了。</p>
<p>不料再走過去，在菜攤一邊，更有比這個離奇的玩意兒。五十左右歲的女乞丐在一旁伸手要錢，貼身却跪着一個十二三歲面黃肌瘦的女孩子，端着一只木瓢，在嚼着滿口的稻　，木瓢中盛的也是這僩，女孩眼裏好像還有淚痕，木瓢一邊，已有「慈善家」放了十幾張一千元的票子，好像成續已經不錯了。</p>
<p>我的心動了一下。這女孩吃飽穿暖的事且不談，做母親而肯讓自己的女見表演吞糠粃，藉此斂錢，恐是不大容易有的事。聰明的所羅門王用殺死幼兒以斷定母規的眞假，是眞母親當然會痛哭流涕的。母性之偉大在此，可憐的母性値得我們帮助也在此，若是犧牲了親女兒帶了淚（可能是因爲不肯而被打的）變這種把戲，這母親恐怕身分上大右問題，那些鈔票能否帶給作女兒的以溫暖，則尤其不敢定矣。</p>
<p>中國人也許是最喜歡欣賞殘忍的，所以殺人必須在雲陽市口，示衆，而大盜憨不畏死，亦以「二十年後又是一條好漢」自豪　，「出紅差」時，滿坑滿谷，以　為稀有約熱鬧，新聞記者必拍一照以爲題材，這都是鐵一般的事實。別的國家在五十年前就秘密執行死刑，好像我們熱視無睹，一回事。兩者可以不必混爲一談。司馬還的文章雖好，像刺客列傳那麽「感君恩重許君令，泰山一擲輕鴻毛」的記載，把殺頭自刎當作家常便飯，實在也不是什麽好事，日本人以切腹自嗚得意，什麽赤穗四十七義士等，然而好勇門狠終於召致不　自焚之慘，我覺得「二刀流」的武士道委貴沒什麽了不得，雖然有一股矯戾的忠義之氣。一個民族不能以搏大寛仁和平中正奠定廣大崇高的基礎，總有點「飄風不終朝疾雨不終日」的感覺，至少我是如此，也許我的神經太衰弱。</p>
<p>北方有些乞丐專門在冬天呑食硫磺，至春熱發，遍身潰爛，臥在街頭，賺慈善者的援助，事實上他們有了錢却去買白干酒和薰猪肉吃，再多了便下賭塲，此一事也；還有街頭賣解者，至最後一塲，必有刀殺親子，支解八塊的表演，看者如不覩此，總覺得不算過癮，此又一事也。兩者的目的與方法都是一樣，利用人　好奇心引起變態同情，以達到騙錢的計畫。對於啼飢號寒者，應該「絕少分甘」，人飢己飢的去從事，豈止同情和救濟，直應看作自己的病痛，張橫渠西銘講得好，「民吾同胞物五口與也」，自然不該有刻薄的挑剔，然而若受了作偽者的欺騙，也就等於受了別人的剝削，　蟲們多得一分，即眞正可憐人少受一分，也是不能不加抉擇的。</p>
<p>而且這裏老的民族，到這時已是百病齊發，若沒有淸熱解　的正本淸源之　，以止息許多內在的隱患，危險正在不堪言者。即如社會上可憐蟲如此之多，若一間離為為之，執令致之，恐怕殘忍二字，又不限於令女兒吃糠這一點小事了！鳴呼，尚何言哉！</p>
<h3>母愛</h3>
<p>— 李淸城</p>
<p>前幾年澳洲鬧旱災的時候，森林裏野獸渴得甚至敢到當地居民的大門口來找水喝，但這些居民也在倒霉，他們的牲畜牛羊也因爲缺水，在成羣的死掉，所以居民們遂不得不在大門口預備一枝實彈的槍，隨時注意，以免這點賓貴的水被野獸喝光。</p>
<p>在一個炎熟的夏日，一個居民忽然發現一隻袋鼠從林十里跑出來，肚袋里還有隻小袋鼠。他馬上學槍準備，那袋鼠緩慢的跑過房屋周圍枯焦的空地，越來越近了，牠棕色美歷的眼睛乞求地注視着那居民，直向那水桶跑過去，那桶水是留給未死的家畜喝的。這位居民竟忘了射擊。</p>
<p>牠到了水桶旁邊，立在那裏，柔和的眸子仍然注視着這位居民，此時牠肚袋里的小袋鼠迅速的喝了個够，馬上，牠轉過身，自己一滴水也沒有喝，就越過空地，向着　林深處逃去。這位居民呆看着牠，一直到失了踪跡。他　下了槍，心裏像是塞了一塊沉重的鉛塊。</p>

<h3>想到列寗之死</h3>
<p>— 茂仁</p>
<p>前幾天報上就傳蘇聯史太林元帥患病之訊，晚報更有瑞士京城盛傳已死之說。我想說史氏已死無論如何是種謠傳，因爲史氏若死，蘇聯無秘不發喪之必要。列寗是一九二四年一月二十一日夜逝世的，二十二日早晨加里寗主席就召開全蘇聯議會報吿噩耗。那時期的蘇聯遠較今日風雨飄搖，尙且並不秘不發喪，更何况在今日國泰民安之際。</p>
<p>列寗死後的公報僅寥寥數語：「烏拉第密爾伊利區（按「列寗」原係化名）病狀於一月二十一日突轉沉重。下午五時十分呼吸停止，神志昏迷;至六時五十分因呼吸器中心麻痺逝世。」但在加里寗向全蘇聯議會報吿噩耗剎那，情形殊足動人。議會開會時問爲上午十一時五十分，加里寗昨夜澈宵未眠，眼淚流了一臉。在座諸人情知有異，心神不寗。音樂奏起蘇維埃喪曲，但瞬即停止，因爲加里寗嗚嗚咽咽的發言道：</p>
<p>「我報吿諸位一個關於我們的親愛同志烏拉第密爾伊利區的可怕的消息。」</p>
<p>廊下有一婦人低低啜泣起來，一陣哭聲隨之而起。</p>
<p>「昨天，」加里寗顫聲續說，「昨天他再度麻痺，而│」他說不下去，好像已無力道出下面的千鈞字眼。然後用盡全力吐出「死了」二字。</p>
<p>多情善感的斯拉夫性情立刻發作，整個大廳之中只聞一片泣聲，輕輕的，哀哀的。加里寗說不出話來，好容易等大家安靜下去，才宣讀上面所引的公報。</p>
<p>列寗的病狀除心腹之外，別人固然不知他已入膏肓，即連在他臨死那天還在一起的左右，對於其撒手人間也覺得事出意外。原來廿一日那天上午，列寗還同布哈林及幾個別人外出看獵，他沒有打獵，只坐在　軍上斜靠着枕頭旁觀。過去兩週他的病狀大有進步，外面看看大家以爲當於病體有益。回去的時候精神很好，不過神色疲倦，醫生勸他睡覺。他在三時左右吃了頓　盛的飯，然後上床。就在睡眠之中第三次也是最後一次的麻痹來，從此不再淸醒。</p>
<p>列寗的最後一句話是：「看這隻狗。」原來當他凝神觀獵之際，有一隻獵狗啣來一鳥給站在他身邊的布哈林，列寗舉起手，說：「看這隻狗。」從此就沒有說過話了。</p>

<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　禍不單行　（三九）</p>
<p>綺紈道：「父視這次得病，完全爲我而起，他不放心我們出來，怕我們出事，臨走的時候，再三叮囑我，交我許多名片，呌我拜訪許多人，意思是要託人照應，可見老人家對我們這次出來，是如何不放心。我，上次接到大姊的信，紙說家裏平安，父親也頗健康，嫌家中不淸靜，搬到捨飯寺一家飯店居住，並沒提父親病狀，我心裏就覺可疑。却想不到父親病得這麽重，家裏竟還瞞我們，呌我如何對得住我的父親呀！」說着，又哭。鶴舟雖然口裏安　　紈，也心酸欲絕，兩眼眼淚，也陸讀流下。綺紈哭了一會，拿出一疊鈔票，　給鶴舟道：「哥哥，你把這些錢帶回去，這是我由「小份」，慢慢積蓄成數的錢，你帶回去。父親病體，如有　機，這筆錢可助醫藥費，萬一有個意外，種種花錢更多，拿來應急也好。」說到這裏，兄妹二人又抱頭痛哭起來。最後鶴舟止住哭，說道：「我希望老人家得佛爺保佑，轉危爲安！我明天一早趕回，你爲合同關係，不要亂了心，還是盡心演唱，保特住我們的名譽。」　紈道：「我還有什麼心緒唱戲呀！」鶴舟道：「這是關係我們前途的，你不能不忍痛幹去！」綺紈哭道：「梨園行這碗飯是吃不得的，我這一次合同滿後，我就改行，再不唱戲了！」說着又哭。這一晚他們兄妹二人，說着哭着，整整一夜却沒睡。到第二日，綺紈攬鏡一照，一雙眼睛都紅腫了，對鶴舟遺：「哥哥，我不能到車站送你，你到北平，先來電報，好呌我放心！」鶴舟一一答應，當日趁着快車回去，到達北平，由車站坐着人力車，回到家裏，車子剛剛拉進胡同口，遠遠便看見他家院裏，搭着一座席篷，一陣心酸，料想老父已經不在人世，家裏已經搭起喪棚辦事。及到車子臨近一看，却是隔壁家裏的天篷，急忙忙下車，趕到家裏，老父躺在床上，已在彌留之際，但是，神志尙淸，鶴舟俯在床前，連呌幾聲「爹爹」，他喘着勉強應了一聲，伸出手來，拉着鶴舟的一隻手，嘴裏短促的說着：「孩子，你回來了，好，好！」又勉强睜開沒神的眼睛，向床前一看，又說：「孩子，你的妹妹呢？綺紈，綺紈！只說這幾句話，又陷於昏迷狀態了。直延到次日早最七點，這一代名伶就在子女環跪床前之下，睜開眼睛看看他們，露出不捨的樣子，便拋下兒女，與世長辭了。鶴舟美了一陣，急着籌辦喪事，一面發電通知綺紈。綺紈驟遭大故，向國方請假，園方論人情也不能不答應，祇要求到北平喪事一完，務須即來，這裏局面，無論如何，全仗她維持下去，並送了一份厚禮。</p>
<h3>岳飛詩</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜</p>
<p>坊間刋行之岳忠武王集，爲淸人所輯，類多採自金陀粹編，掇拾頗有未盡。而其序言以武穆之諡爲岳飛奇榮，似若前後無諡武穆以與岳飛競美者然，此尤無職。蓋岳飛初諡武穆，易諡乃員忠武，忠武之諡，固較武穆爲勝，自宜舉忠武爲言，不當斤斤於武穆也。且古之諡武穆者，唐代有李光弼，與飛同時復有劉錡，亦已多人，豈僅岳飛獨膺此諡。淺見如此，毋怪其搜羅之不能廣焉。集中可傳誦之文，惟滿江紅一闋最著人口。而賓退錄載：「紹興癸丑，岳武穆提兵平虔吉發盜，道出新淦，題詩靑泥市蕭寺壁間云：雄氣堂堂貫斗牛，誓將直節報君仇，斬盡頑惡還車駕，不問登壞萬戶候。淳熙問林令（梓）欲慕刻于石，會罷去，不果。今寺廢壁亡矣，其孫類家集，惜未有吿之者。」詩雖不若滿江紅詞之工，然慷慨壯烈，忠武生平志節，亦已自述無遺。集中顧未之載，未免餘憾，轉錄出以補其　。按韓（世忠）岳兩忠武皆起身行伍，而皆能詩詞，亦一奇也。（韓王雖無專集，而其詩詞，一再雜見宋人說部。）惟韓忠武之　與詞，多退隱後所作，故具淸逸淡遠之致，已掩郤氣呑胡處之本眞面目，與岳忠武之悲憤感激，逈不相侔，然非韓王初志也，每　之　不禁三歎。因述岳忠武詩，附此及之。</p>
<h3>療罪新術</h3>
<p>— 吉金</p>
<p>「治」本來有「療」的意思，例如「治病」。但是一向法官們對罪犯「治」罪，却往往祗是給他一種「殺人者死」之類的報復，而並不於根究人們犯罪的原因之後，施以對症發藥的治療，而使犯罪的動機根本消滅。事實上，今日的監獄竟有成爲「犯罪製造所」的傾向，一個初入歧途的人，往往因爲在監獄裏受到了那些感不畏法的積犯的影響，以致胆子倒大了起來，一出獄門，倒反成了更可怕的匪徒。</p>
<p>現在，美國的司法界已經震泛地採納了犯罪學專家們所提供的「把治罪當作治病看」的意見，結果如何是很値得大家注意的，以下是幾個例子，案情雖小，法官所採取的措施却都很有意義。</p>
<p>有一個偸鷄賊，被捕了許多次，可是放出去後他總是「戝性不改」，還是要偸。後來，一個聰明的法官就幫助他辦了一個小小農塲，呌他養鷄。那個偸鷄賊一成了農塲主人之後，變得愛鷄如命，不但從此安分守己，而且現在已成爲當地最痛恨偷鷄賊的人了。他勤懇工作，已成小康。</p>
<p>有一個汽車司機，常常喜歡把汽車開得極快，　次惹禍被捕。後來，他撞死了一個小孩，那位承審的法官就呌他到驗尸所裏去仔細看一看那個孩子的血肉糢糊的尸體。結果，他從此改過了。</p>
<p>有一個婦人控告她的丈夫對她不好，因爲他每一個月祗肯給她二十塊錢做開銷。法官的判決是，那個丈夫的全部收入暫存銀行，除了給他的太太的二十塊錢外，他自己每月也祗准用二十塊錢，結果，果然那位丈夫便痛自悛改，夫妻和好如初。</p>
<p>另有一個婦人，到法庭控訴她的丈夫，說他常常打她，而且從來不肯和她一同出一次門。法官把那個丈夫呌來訊問時，那個丈夫說：「你看她長得這樣醜，偏又不肯答應離婚，呌我如何不氣？」那位法官想出了一　　許祗有美國的法官才想得出的辦法，他呌那男人拿出一筆錢來，呌那個女人到美容院去修飾一番！結果倒也從此太平無事了，不想我國聊　誌異裏的恒娘，倒竞然在海外我到了這一位所見略同的法界知己！</p>
<h3>訪歸震川先生故居</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>遷居安亭已有半年了。一半是爲了它本是我家祖代的故鄕，我雖不是生長在那裏，可是人過中年，不免要起一種木木水源之念；一半却是爲了它是明代大文學家歸震川先生曾經住過的地方，當我每次到那鎭北震川書院的斷垣殘石中盤桓憑弔時，總是使我對于這位平昔景仰萬分的抒情大家引起一種崇敬依戀之念。有了這兩個原因，所以我竞毫不留　那曾經住居過三十多年的故居，而毅然地遷到這裏來了。</p>
<p>我現在住的地方，是在鎭的南梢，離祖居和震川書院約有一里左右路程，可是和這裏只有一永之隔，却是震川先生生前常居在那裏　書的地方！就是世美堂遺址。世美堂本是靈川先生岳家王姓的產業，築於明朝威化年問，「有　百楹，堂宇　敞，極幽雅之致」，可見這所建築是相當宏大的。到了嘉靖年間，王姓中落，把它抵償了欠使。那時震川先生恰住在岳家　書，經夫婦商酌之後，因爲王夫人不忍「頓有黍離之悲」，震川先生也愛它地方幽靜，就決定由他分年償還債款，把它贖了回來。堂西本來有些池林山石之勝，山上還有亭子，震川先生就題亭名爲畏壘亭，作有畏壘亭記，文中頗寓人棄我取，遁世化俗之意。後來那位和他平時常在一處的長公子死了，又在那裏築有思子亭，當我們驤思子亭記，讀到「徘徊四望，長天寥廓，極目于雲烟杏　之問，當必有一日見吾兒翩然來歸者」，便可想見當時歸先生怎樣的舐犢情深，令數百年後的吾們　了，猶爲之欷歔泣下。</p>
<p>可是說來慚怍，遷到這裏已經半年，我對于道近在咫尺，而又是平時萬分景仰的大作家的故居遺址，時時想去拜訪，却是始終沒有實現。雖說是爲了生活，沒有一刻兒放得下筆，然而畢竞也近乎荒庸。近日「寒風慘　，木葉黃落」，終日伏案，手偃足縮，忽然想起了　川先生畏　亭記中的名句，追緬他當時「呼兒酌酒，登事而嘯」的景况，更不禁悠然神往。于是擲　而起，戴帽　中，決定前去走訪。</p>
<p>下樓出門，迎着北風，渡過小橋，向西過了井亭橋，再回身向南，渡過一座木欄小橋，便到了田野。背江西望，除遠處村莊外，平　一片，祗見枯黃顏色。這時胸中早已滿懐着蒼凉之感。於是依照安亭鎭志所載，循路前去，勢　到了所謂世美堂的遺址。但祗有枯竹半林，不見牆基柱礎，似乎久已沒有屋宇。就是堂北那座萬福橋，三接的石梁，衆河北那一接也已經斷掉。走到橋上，回身四顧，滿目荒凉，不堪久望。俯視斷梁之下，流水潺湲，亦莫覩浮鱗來往。這時北風更烈，吹人欲墮，遂退下橋來，想找人問訊。可是這時正是邊暇時節，四下無人，即牧牛村　，也不見形踪。漫步再向南走去，不知不覺走到了公路。偶然回頭觀望。但見鎭上白精黑垣之中，夾露着幾處紅牆，那是這裏著名特多的廟宇。看見了這些，忽然想像歸震川那樣一代文豪，凡是巡過學校的人　都讀過他的文章而知道他的名字，可是他的住　之地，却沒有人崇敬他，甚至只有極少的人知道有他這一個人，不如那社神火神，反而到處有人主廟禮拜，不禁為之憤憤不平！</p>
<p>等到歸來後，靜坐室中，默然深思：歷史上出名的文人，幾乎沒有一個不是生前瀝倒，身後落寞，怪不得魯迅先生的遺囑裏，不頭他自已的兒子做什麽空頭文學家。一想到「空頭」二字，不田惕然一驚。由此盈悟到在鄕野村市之中，爲什麽大多數人祗知尊敬社神火神，而不知崇拜文學家的理由。你想：鄕村生活，全賴土地生產，民生最要的是食與工作，而無火不能熟食，晚上也不能工作。給他們最最切身需要的社神火神，自然不由他們不因感謝而生尊敬。即使文學家的文章是以有益身心，說是什麽人類不可少的精神食糧，然而這些精神食糧，無論怎樣滋補，但在過去和現在，總是少數人才有機會享受，那麽這位一代文人歸震川先生在他的居住地方，反不及當地社神火神的受到萬人愛戴，並非沒有理由了。</p>
<p>此文之寫，本想發抒我的思古幽情，結果却只表現了我的一些　薄的感想，然而我的憤憤之心，遂由此平靜下來了。</p>

<h3>Chairman Returns to Capital from Shenyang; Presides Over High-Ranking Generals Conference in Shenyang; National Army's Offensive in Western Liaoning Alters War Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Chairman Chiang's special plane returned to the capital from Shenyang at 5:40 PM on the eleventh. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Liu Fei, and Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs of the National Government, Yu Jishi, returned together. Yesterday's report that Du Yuming followed the Chairman by plane was inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th] According to someone arriving from Changchun today: Chairman Chiang flew to Changchun yesterday. Chen Cheng did not go to the airport to welcome him due to illness. That night, he convened a conference of high-ranking generals such as Chen and Wei. Xiong Shihui and Du Yuming did not accompany him.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th] Fu Zuoyi flew back to Beiping from Jinzhou at 3:00 PM on the eleventh. He had met with the Chairman several times in Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 11th] Following the National Army's brilliant victory in the large-scale annihilation battles on both sides of the Liao River within the past three days, bandit remnants in the western Shenyang area are still gathering three or four columns, attempting to intrude again. Therefore, the fate of the bandits is still difficult to determine within the week. However, it is generally believed that the war in northwestern Shenyang has opened a new chapter.</p>
<p>[Our Shen Office, 11th] After the National Army's large-scale advance towards the west bank of the Liao River, the war situation has changed. The bandit forces in Dahushan on the northern Jinzhou Line have been cleared. Only a small group raided Xinmin Nanliuhegou on the night of the tenth, but they were repelled by the National Army at dawn on the eleventh.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, Eleventh, Latest] After the great victory in western Liaoning, the 10th Regiment of Lin Biao's 4th Column was completely surrounded and annihilated by the National Army near Faku at 8:00 PM on the eighth. In addition, approximately four thousand bandits from the 34th, 35th, and 36th Regiments were largely captured alive by the National Army after a portion of them were annihilated. A large amount of spoils of war were seized and are currently being inventoried.</p>
<h3>National Army Scores Spring Victory in Xiaozhan, Southeast of Tianjin; Recaptures Mancheng and Annihilates a Bandit Regiment</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 11th] The key point of Xiaozhan in southeastern Tianjin was recovered at 8:00 AM on the eleventh. Three routes of the National Army began operations on the tenth. On the eleventh, one route reached the East-West Garden, three li northeast of Xiaozhan, another route reached Yihe, four li north of Xiaozhan, and another route reached Bali Tai, more than ten li west of Xiaozhan, and the line of Dasunzhuang. They launched a general attack at dawn and entered Xiaozhan at 8:00 AM. In this battle, over eight hundred bandits were killed, and over fifty were captured. The remaining bandits fled southwest. Another route of the National Army simultaneously attacked Chaozong Bridge, a retreat route of the bandits southwest of Xiaozhan. Fierce fighting continued at three li north of Chaozong Bridge until noon.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th] After the National Army in southeastern Tianjin recovered Xiaozhan, the Communists retreated southwest, and the south bank of the Hai River is about to be cleared. In addition, over a thousand bandits sneaked into the vicinity of Langfang the night before last, and the National Army is driving them out. On the Beining Line, a coal train derailed due to a mine explosion between Junliangcheng and Xinhejian last night, and a landmine exploded between Shimen and Anshan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th] Gunfire was heard again in Beiping. Over a thousand Communist bandits raided the Waige area outside the Mentougou mining district again last night, and the National Army is sweeping through the area.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Office, 11th] The National Army achieved victory in the annihilation battle between Baoding and Mancheng. In the battle of Sunjiazhuang, Zhanghaizhuang, and Xiajiaying, twenty li west of Baoding, on the tenth, the entire 29th Regiment of the 10th Brigade of the Communist 4th Column was annihilated. Two bandit battalions were annihilated in Macun, two li west of Mancheng, and one bandit battalion was annihilated in Daguodian, southwest of Baoding. A certain fast-moving elite unit of the National Army entered Mancheng from Dawangdian on the tenth. The bandit leader Nie Rongzhen led the 2nd and 3rd Columns through Wucun, a mountainous area twenty li southwest of Mancheng, and fled in a panic towards Wanxian. The National Army followed closely and engaged in fierce fighting upon reaching Wucun after 3:00 PM on the eleventh. According to reported results, over six hundred were captured alive, and over five hundred rifles, over twenty light machine guns, and two heavy mortar guns were seized. The remainder are still being inventoried. According to a certain military official, the Communist 3rd Column lost two brigades in the western Hebei campaign. The entire 11th Brigade of the 4th Column was annihilated in the Yaocun battle. Two regiments of the Communist 4th Column were annihilated between Baoding and Mancheng on the tenth. In terms of numbers, the Communists have suffered losses of over twenty thousand.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, Eleventh] The National Army in central Hebei achieved brilliant results in the recapture of Mancheng. A total of six bandit regiments were annihilated, over eight hundred were captured alive, and over fifty light and heavy machine guns, over a thousand rifles, and other war spoils were seized. The National Army's cavalry charged through Mancheng and launched an attack on Yaoshan Wucun, a Communist stronghold in the southeast of Wanxian. This village was recaptured around 2:00 PM today, and the search and advance southwestward continues. 　　[Central News Agency, Baoding, Eleventh] The battle on the Pingbao (Beiping-Baoding) section is nearing its end, and it has been verified that the bandit losses amount to ten regiments.</p>
<h3>Jinnan Recaptures Jiexian</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The National Army sweeping through northern Henan after crossing the river recovered Jiexian on the tenth. The remaining bandits fled in defeat towards the northeast.</p>
<h3>Southwest Henan Dengxian City's Local Militia Engages in Hand-to-Hand Combat to Defend Against Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] Thirty thousand bandits in southwestern Henan, led by Chen Geng himself, launched a fierce attack on Dengxian on the evening of the tenth. The defending local militia bravely fought back with vastly inferior forces, repeatedly charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat in the northern and western suburbs of the city over the past two days, inflicting heavy losses on the attacking bandits. After suffering losses, Chen Geng regrouped the follow-up bandit troops and continued to attack the city walls. The local militia are still engaged in fierce battles with the bandits in the suburbs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, Eleventh] Chen Geng's Communist troops besieging Dengxian suffered heavy casualties after being bombed by our air force on the tenth, and scattered to villages more than fifteen li away from the city. After dusk, they repeatedly launched attacks on the city walls, and a portion of them even broke into the south gate. After a brave counterattack by the local militia, the bandits were finally repelled. Another powerful unit of the National Army has been rushing to their aid from a certain location, and it is expected that the bandits attacking Dengxian will be completely defeated by us in the short term.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, Eleventh] A large-scale annihilation battle is currently underway in western Henan, as the two thousand or so troops of Liu Bocheng stationed between Xinye and Dengxian in the Bai River valley are about to be completely annihilated by the National Army prepositioned on the highlands on both sides of the river.</p>
<h3>Heze Garrison Commended by Chairman for Meritorious Service; Chen Bandit Intruding in Ningling, Eastern Henan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, Eleventh] The Heze garrison fought bloodily with the bandits for half a month and achieved a glorious victory. Chairman Chiang and General Commander wished to congratulate them, recognizing that the unit had firmly defended the isolated city, fought against a superior enemy with inferior forces, and achieved brilliant results after half a month of hard fighting. A commendation order was issued, and meritorious officers and soldiers were rewarded.</p>
<p>[Our Bengjing Office, 11th] Chen Yi's 8th Column of bandits suffered extremely heavy losses after being pursued and suppressed by the National Army in western Shandong for days. On the tenth, they fled west of the Liu River after Cao County in the southwest region. They took advantage of the night to cross the railway and fled south. A portion of them arrived at Bodangji (southwest of Liu River) on the morning of the tenth, and a portion of them continued to flee to the vicinity of Ningling in the afternoon. They are currently in battle with the local militia near Ningling.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 11th] Chen Yi's bandit troops stationed in Xiangcheng and Linquan are attempting to invade eastward. The people of Fuyang hope that the Commissioner and County Magistrate of Zhizha will quickly return to govern. The newly added 14th Pacification Headquarters in the Yubei (Henan Border) District of the Ministry of National Defense may be established in Fuyang. The people of Anhui hope that Commander Li Jue will come quickly to preside over the suppression.</p>
<h3>Shandong Bandits Flee Southward, Vainly Attempting to Rebuild Yimeng Old Base</h3>
<p>[Our Weixian Office, 11th] The Communist 2nd, 7th, and 9th Columns have been actively reorganizing in Mazhan, north of Yishui, Guanshiqian, southwest of Zhucheng, and Ma'ershan, southeast of Zhucheng, since fleeing south across the Jiaoji Railway at the end of last month. A portion of them have even infiltrated into Tanbu (northeast of Mengyin), Antiqing (west of Juxian), and Meishi (south of Juxian) in the Yimeng Mountain area, never forgetting their attempt to rebuild their old base in the Yimeng Mountain area. However, since the construction in the mountain area was thoroughly destroyed by the National Army long ago, this move by the Communist bandits only reveals their futile efforts.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 11th] The independent brigade and the new 8th, 9th, and 14th Regiments of bandits attacking the suburbs of Dongping were annihilated by the National Army on the tenth, losing two battalions, and the remaining bandits fled west towards Anshan Town.</p>
<h3>Anhui Southern Local Communist Leader Yang Ming Has Been Killed</h3>

<h3>Clearing Out Scattered Bandits in South China; Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in Five Provinces to Be Established Within the Month; Chairmen of Jiangxi and Fujian to Confer in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 11th] Director Song Ziwen has decided to concentrate all his efforts to deal with this major security problem in order to eliminate bandits in South China, with the intention to pacify the area this year and then discuss reconstruction. He recently held secret talks with Guo Siyuan, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression on the borders of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan, who recently came to Guangzhou, to discuss methods for clearing out bandits on the Guangdong-Hunan border. It is reported that the Guangzhou Xingyuan has decided to establish a headquarters for bandit suppression in the border areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian within the month, with Ye Zhao designated as the Commander-in-Chief. Guo Siyuan has been consulted to be the deputy, but Guo has not yet made a decision.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] It is reported that the Guangzhou Xingyuan has been ordered to expand its authority, with Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi and Guangzhou City all included in its jurisdiction, and all military powers and affairs are under the supervision and command of the Guangzhou Xingyuan. It is also reported that Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji, in order to coordinate the military deployment for bandit suppression between Jiangxi and Guangdong, has decided to come to Guangzhou in the middle of the month to meet with Director Song Ziwen to discuss the joint suppression of bandits in the border areas of the two provinces. Fujian Chairman Liu Jianxu may also come to Guangzhou in the middle of the month.</p>
<p>[Our Guilin Office, 11th] Border defenses along the Hunan-Guangxi border have been actively strengthened. Chen En-yuan, the Commissioner of the Eighth District, has already gone to Daoxian and Yongming on the Hunan border to inspect and deploy, and will immediately launch suppression operations.</p>
<p>[Our Changsha Office, 11th] The Yuehan Railway has recently been re-equipped with one armored train, and armed railway police officers dispatched by the Police Department are equipped with machine guns to patrol the Shaozhou-Guangzhou section.</p>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Office, 11th] A group of bandits, numbering nearly a hundred, was recently discovered in Changtai County, southern Fujian. On the fifth, they invaded Yanxi and were repelled by the police. On the sixth and seventh, they fled to Wachibanmei and other places in the county, engaging in indiscriminate robbery and murder. The National Army has been dispatching troops in recent days to prepare for encirclement and suppression. In other news: the bandits have killed the local self-defense squad leader and a tax bureau employee, and a villager, Cai Zhouyuan, was dismembered.</p>
<h3>We Have the Right to Dispatch Customs Personnel to Be Permanently Stationed at Hong Kong Customs Office to Prevent Smuggling Between Hong Kong and Kowloon as Stipulated in Agreement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed that the agreement between China and Britain on the prevention of smuggling between Hong Kong and Kowloon will be established on the twelfth, but there is no signing ceremony, as the matters involved in this agreement are local and specialized, and there is no need for a formal agreement to be signed. The measures to prevent smuggling between Hong Kong and Kowloon have been agreed upon after repeated negotiations between the two parties, and the treaty will be constituted by the exchange of letters on the twelfth. According to what reporters have learned, according to this exchange of letters, it is stipulated that we have no obligations, but have the right to dispatch customs personnel to be permanently stationed at the Hong Kong Customs Office to handle the inspection of imports and exports and anti-smuggling together with Hong Kong personnel. The British side's agreement to our proposed plan and granting us this right is a purely friendly act without any exchange conditions; this is because smuggling between Hong Kong and Kowloon not only harms our country's interests but also provides no benefit to Hong Kong, and undermines the regulations and credibility of Hong Kong Customs. When Hong Kong Governor Grantham came to Beijing last year, he publicly stated that he was willing to assist in prevention. Now that the agreement is about to be established, the British side acknowledges its treaty obligations, and this cooperation will definitely be more active and achieve greater results. It is said that after the exchange of letters on the twelfth, the main points or the full text will be announced.</p>
<h3>Pei Tsu-yi to Fly to the U.S. the Day After Tomorrow; Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Beijing to Meet with the Financial Community</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Pei Tsu-yi, a member of our technical advisory group to the United States, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday with his entourage. Lu Dingzhong, secretary of the National Bank, and others went to the station to greet him. Pei told reporters: "I have decided to fly to the United States on the fourteenth. The members of the entourage have already been announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and there have been no changes. I have just returned to China from Hong Kong and am somewhat out of touch with the domestic situation. What I know is not as much as you do. Moreover, I am responsible for a mission abroad, and I really have nothing to report at present. I will have to wait until I return to China before I can express my opinions. The information I have collected from various sources is quite rich, but it has been rumored that I am carrying a proposal to reform the currency system to the United States. I cannot confirm this. Only the government can answer that. It is difficult to predict at this time whether U.S. aid may exceed $300 million. From our country's standpoint, of course, the more the better. As for whether the technical advisory group will inquire about U.S. military aid to China, please ask Minister Yu to answer that."</p>
<p>After Pei arrived in Shanghai, many friends from the Bank of China visited him. During his two-day stay in Shanghai, he is scheduled to meet with Chen Guangfu, Li Ming, and other important figures in the financial community, and will also meet with other people from all walks of life as needed to gather ideas and benefit from different perspectives. Pei and his group of three or four people will fly directly to the United States on the fourteenth on a China National Aviation Corporation's "Skymaster" jumbo jet. Chen Changtong, manager of the Bank of China's foreign department, was originally scheduled to go with him, but he has now decided to postpone his departure for a few days due to business. (The picture shows Pei Tsu-yi (with a circle) arriving in Shanghai and posing for a photo at the station. Photo by our newspaper.)</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, Eleventh] Personnel from the National Economic Council told our reporters that adopting a new currency system supplemented by a huge reserve is the only effective way to solve China's economic chaos, but said that implementing currency reform this spring is somewhat wishful thinking. China will not take any action in this regard until it receives a solid guarantee of assistance from the United States.</p>
<h3>Army Training Conference to Be Convened Soon in Nanjing; Sun Liren Flies to Beijing from Taiwan to Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] General Sun Liren, Commander-in-Chief of Army Training, flew to Beijing from Taiwan at approximately 2:00 PM on the eleventh. After Sun returned to his residence for a brief rest, two American military advisors visited him, and a small group meeting was held until 6:00 PM. It is heard that the content of the meeting was related to the problem of the U.S. assisting us in training troops. It is also heard that the issue of the U.S. assisting us in training troops will also be brought up for discussion at the upcoming training conference in Beijing. Moreover, the significance of convening the training conference is very important. A comprehensive review and future improvements will be made regarding the training techniques and guidelines for our new recruits. Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to this, so he may personally preside over it. The attendees will be the Minister of National Defense, the Chief of Staff, the Deputy Chief of Staff, and the heads of the responsible departments. However, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng will not be able to attend. In addition, before Sun left Taiwan, he ordered the preparation of various relevant materials, all of which have been brought to Beijing to be presented for the conference report and study. Sun's Chief of Staff, Tang Shouzhi, is scheduled to come to Beijing from Taiwan on the twelfth. It is reported that since the Training Headquarters moved to Taiwan, it has begun training work, which is divided into three parts: new recruit training, cadre training, and special forces training, all of which are proceeding very smoothly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The new military academy was originally scheduled to begin enrolling students this year, but due to insufficient preparation, it was reported to the Ministry of National Defense that the enrollment period be extended by one year and changed to start next year. This has been approved. The Navy Headquarters originally decided not to recruit new naval students because the new military academy would be established this year. Now that the new military academy has been changed to enroll students next year, it has decided to continue recruiting 200 new students, with examinations scheduled for May.</p>
<h3>Nanjing-Shanghai River Defense Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Office, 11th] The Nanjing-Shanghai River Defense Command continued to hold a river defense conference on the morning of the twelfth. After discussing the proposals, a military working group meeting was held. There were detailed plans for strengthening the defense of southern Jiangsu and eliminating scattered bandits. The meeting closed in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi's Remarks in Shanghai; Luo Longji's Movements Not Restricted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Shao Lizi came to Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning to attend the funeral of Ye Chucang in Suzhou. Reporters greeted him at the station. Shao refused to express any opinions on national affairs. Regarding the rumor that the government will establish a semi-official and semi-private institution to accommodate National Assembly representatives affected by the method of nominating candidates by political parties, he said, "I have not heard of it." When asked about the activities of members of the Democratic League after its dissolution overseas, Shao declined, but said that Luo Longji is currently recuperating in a hospital in this city and his freedom of movement has not been restricted.</p>
<h3>Quota for Imports to South China Increased, Accounting for 22 Percent of the National Total</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Office, 11th] When Vice Chairman Sun came to Guangzhou last year, the industrial and commercial circles of Guangzhou requested that the Executive Yuan be instructed to increase the import quota for South China. The Executive Yuan has now replied, stating that the quota for the South China region has been doubled, totaling 3.3 million US dollars, accounting for 22 percent of the national total. The import of machinery has also been coordinated with the designated amount of foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>We Protest the Kowloon City Incident; British Government Is Considering It; Ye Gongchao Leaves Guangzhou to Return to Beijing to Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, Tenth, United Press] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said that Britain has received the Chinese government's protest and is "considering it," but declined to specify its contents. It is believed that the protest is about the Kowloon City incident.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, Eleventh] Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao left Guangzhou on the morning of the eleventh to return to Beijing to report. Ye and Special Commissioner Guo Dehua visited Director Song on the evening of the tenth to discuss the development of the Kowloon City incident.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Municipal Council Sends Personnel to Console Compatriots in Kowloon City</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, Eleventh] A delegation of eight people from the Kowloon City Compatriots Consolidation Group organized by the Guangdong Provincial Council set off on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway train, carrying five shi of white rice, eighty catties of biscuits, ten million National currency, and a large number of medicines, to be distributed to the afflicted compatriots. All Guangzhou newspapers sent reporters.</p>
<p>[Our Jiyang Office, 11th] When news of the Kowloon incident came, the public here was indignant. The Northeast Branch of the National Diplomacy Association, representing the people of the Northeast, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a stern protest with the Hong Kong government, demanding the immediate release of the arrested residents Zhu and Liu, and the prompt reconstruction of the destroyed houses and compensation for losses.</p>
<h3>We Should Resolutely Demand Compensation for Losses from Demolished Houses; Gan Jiehou Discusses the Kowloon City Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th] The diplomat Gan Jiehou, former Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in the Southwest, who handled the Kowloon City incident in 1938, recently spoke about this matter, saying that our government should resolutely demand that the Hong Kong government compensate for the losses from the demolition of houses. If the Hong Kong government's occupation of Kowloon City is for military needs, then Britain may follow the precedent of the British allowing the United States to use its territory as a military base during the Great War, and consult with us in a friendly manner. It is absolutely impermissible to take unilateral coercive action. If the Hong Kong side uses the excuse that Kowloon City residents do not pay attention to hygiene, then we can accept their intention and rectify it. Gan also recounted the history of the Kowloon dispute, and refuted the Hong Kong side's interference with the residents of Kowloon City based on the 1898 Sino-British "Convention Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory". Public opinion organizations here have also exchanged views on the Kowloon incident for days, and will express their views when necessary.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Actively Constructing Highways; Will First Complete Nine Lines, Five Thousand Kilometers This Year</h3>

<h3>Notice on Adjusting Prices for Eight Public Utilities; Executive Yuan Issued for Implementation in Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th] The National Economic Council believes that prices fluctuate from time to time, and the costs of public utilities inevitably rise and fall accordingly. In order to reasonably adjust prices, it has formulated calculation formulas for various public utilities as a standard for determining their prices. Since August 1947, it has begun to collect relevant data. Based on the draft proposed by the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, it drafted eight calculation formulas for electricity prices, water prices, gas prices, telephone prices, tram fares, small train fares, public bus fares, and ferry fares. It has repeatedly invited the responsible departments of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Communications, and the Resources Commission, as well as the public utilities bureaus of Beijing and Shanghai and related manufacturers in Beijing and Shanghai, to discuss and solicit opinions from the municipal governments of Beijing and Tianjin and the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers, and revised them in detail. It has compiled eight draft calculation formulas for public utility prices and submitted them to the 22nd National Economic Council meeting for detailed discussion, revision, and passage. It was also decided to implement them from January 1948 and use them as the basis for adjusting public utility prices in various places. The responsible authorities have added implementation guidelines to the standards for review, and sent them to the Executive Yuan for issuance to relevant ministries and commissions and provincial and municipal governments for implementation. The full text of these guidelines is as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>Party Members Running for Legislative Yuan Must Be Nominated by Political Parties</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Eleventh] In order to strictly implement the resolutions of the State Council, the Election Headquarters has stipulated that party members participating in elections should be limited to nomination by their respective political parties and may not sign up for election on their own. It has recently telegraphed election offices at all levels across the country to provide restrictions on the members of the elections of the Legislative Yuan of various political parties: The members of the election institutes at all levels have personnel from various political parties participating in them. For any questions of party membership, or the presence or absence of party affiliation for nomination, the election institutes at all levels shall create a copy of the list for review by the provincial level party. They will retrieve the document and submit with the other documents. Where a party member has been confirmed, in absence of political party nomination but rather freedom to election, should be restricted by the provisions and substitutions of the political party, no announcement should be made. Those Legislative Yuan who have signed and had their names substituted under the provisions of a party member, even if an announcement has been made, should be revoked.</p>

<p>Theory</p>
<h3>Defeat Defeatism!</h3>
<p>Last year, after General Wedemeyer came to China to conduct an inspection, he issued a statement before his departure, criticizing Chinese intellectuals for being full of defeatism. This was a harsh statement, but it was also a truly invaluable piece of advice.</p>
<p>Indeed, our intellectual circles are filled with defeatism. This doesn't refer to all intellectuals, but at least a portion of them are filled with pessimistic sentiments. Because they hold onto defeatism, they only care about themselves, only care about the present, only know how to complain, only know how to vent grievances, and are unwilling to think about the long-term future of the nation and the people. It's not just some intellectuals who are like this; many people with high expectations in society also inevitably harbor vague defeatist sentiments. Some officials, given the opportunity, immediately become corrupt, even if there are strict punishments to rein them in. Some industrialists who could be productive are unwilling to actively produce, but are secretly planning speculative profiteering. Merchants are unwilling to endure hardships to engage in trade, but are moved by short-term gains and only use opportunities to engage in hoarding and speculation. People in education and culture often flaunt "detachment" and "neutrality," escaping reality, making high-sounding pronouncements, only seeking to deceive themselves and others. Some self-proclaimed authorities in public opinion also dare not point out where the violence threatening the nation and the people is, who the real culprits endangering world peace are, but instead chant vague "anti-civil war," "anti-feudalism," "democracy," "progress," and other empty slogans. Intellectual youths are even more restless, unable to clearly recognize their great responsibilities to the future world and their own country, only knowing how to express dissatisfaction with the status quo, as if no one in the entire country is good except for them, and nothing is pleasing to the eye, so that once stimulated, they immediately provoke student movements, seemingly willing to overthrow everything for the sake of pleasure. And even more unworthy ones, as "seeds of learning" still in school, do not know to "be the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures," but indulge in the world of wine and women, reveling in singing and dancing. These various states of麻醉(anesthesia), complacency, decline, escape, as well as impulsiveness and decadence, all without exception prove that defeatism is at work.</p>
<p>Naturally, among intellectuals, there are many strong individuals who face reality, persevere in struggle, make continuous efforts, and are indomitable, working hard and diligently for the country and the people, but unfortunately they are overshadowed by the prevailing atmosphere of defeatism in society and are not easily recognized by superficial observers.</p>
<p>However, in this atmosphere of defeatism, our workers and our farmers are still silently struggling arduously, just like the soldiers on the front lines fighting to the death with the Communist bandits who harm the country and the people. In safe areas, workers are constantly working, and farmers are constantly cultivating to supply the military and civilians with clothing, food, and supplies. In bandit suppression areas, today the railway is destroyed, and tomorrow it is repaired and reopened; today the mines and factories are destroyed, and tomorrow they are repaired and put back into production. The vast countryside is harassed, plundered, slaughtered, and coerced by the Communist bandits, but when the bandits come, the farmers fight bravely, and after the bandits leave, they rebuild their old homes on the ruins and actively cultivate. They are truly engaged in the struggle of "construction against destruction" and "survival against death." Those in the front fall, and those in the back stand up. They have never been conquered by defeatism. This is the spirit of the Chinese nation and an example for those intellectuals full of pessimistic sentiments.</p>
<p>Indeed, many intellectuals are now dispirited, depressed, or indignant and resentful of the world, but we believe that their spirit will eventually rise again. In the process of the Chinese revolution over the past fifty or sixty years, in the process of building a new China, the history of intellectuals' efforts has been glorious, standing in the leading position of the revolutionary movement and nation-building work. From the Xinhai Revolution to the Northern Expedition, to the eight-year War of Resistance, and even all construction undertakings, intellectuals have always stood on the front lines. Especially the tragic history of the War of Resistance, we have personally experienced it and our memories are still fresh. On the eve of the War of Resistance, the passionate and indignant spirit of intellectuals, ready to go, and in the process of the War of Resistance, the tenacious and steadfast, calm and struggling emotions of intellectuals, were all the most sacred and great expressions of human spirit. This expression is enough to guarantee that the Chinese nation can resist foreign aggression in the past, can fight against war and chaos today, and can exist forever in the world.</p>
<p>Now, we are facing the era between the "September 18th Incident" and the "July 7th Incident" again. The covetous gaze of external forces is heavier and more cunning than that of Japan. The Communist bandits' activities of creating internal turmoil and selling out the motherland are unfolding universally and deeply in military, economic, and other aspects, and even creating fallacies that deny that national and national interests are above all else to confuse people's minds. In the past, the traitors' evil theory of "East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" was not enough to deceive us, but instead aroused our indignation, but today, the Communist bandits' fallacies, like poison coated with sugar, deceive naive youths. This is where the real crisis lies! However, among the educators on whom the future destiny of our nation and people depends, some "scholars" believe that they are only responsible for peddling knowledge, turning a blind eye to these phenomena, and using the banner of catering to the trend of freedom and preserving the reputation of academic cliques as their purpose, and will not stop until they harm the youth and bury the country. It must be known that at this critical moment of national and popular destiny, we can only do our best to combat defeatism, clear up pessimistic sentiments, revive our spirit, face our reality squarely, stand up our shoulders, align our steps, fight against the harsh environment, and work hard for the construction of a new China based on the Three People's Principles, in order to save our nation and people from the fate of destruction!</p>
<p>We firmly believe that darkness is temporary, and light will surely come. After the severe winter, spring will surely arrive. Life is short, but the life of the nation will be passed on forever. We should not be tormented by darkness, but should move forward to a bright future with enthusiasm. Look, with President Chiang's old age, he still has to undertake more than eighteen hours of work every day, traveling back and forth, with no time to rest. Doesn't this active spirit inspire us?</p>
<p>The President instructed us on New Year's Day: We should use three years to quell the banditry and stabilize society. Let us revive the spirit of the eve of our War of Resistance, combat all defeatism, eliminate all corrupt and evil forces, to welcome this firm declaration, and fulfill our due responsibilities!</p>

<h3>Notes on Utility Pricing</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) The adjustment of prices for eight public utilities, including electricity, tap water, gas, telephone, tram, small train, bus, and ferry, in various regions will be based on the calculation formulas determined by this committee from January 1948. Public utilities in various regions should submit their income and expenditure accounts and cost calculations for the past year to the local competent authorities for thorough investigation and verification, and should continue to report them on a monthly basis. Whether the price determination is appropriate depends entirely on whether the various bases and total coefficients in the formula are reasonable. The verification procedures for the bases and total coefficients are as follows: A. Each public utility calculates its various bases based on its expenses for the past year and reports them to the local competent authority. B. Each public utility calculates the total amount of various taxes, dues, and profits that should be paid, as well as the percentage of this amount to the total production cost, calculates one time the total coefficient, verifies it, and reports it to the local competent authority. C. The local competent authority carefully reviews the obtained information, and if there are any exaggerations, it should be corrected to ensure accuracy, and after proper formulation, it should be submitted to the central competent authority for verification. The fuel prices used in the formula are based on the prices set by the Fuel Management Committee (but transportation costs may be added), the exchange rate is based on the market price announced by the Balance Fund Committee, and the cost of living index and the price index of hardware materials are based on the figures announced by the local government. Regarding the repair and maintenance costs in the formula, the ratio of the part that should be included in the foreign exchange or hardware material costs and the part of the cost of living index should be related to old debts, depreciation, and loan interest, which should be added to the price amortization in several months. The amount and months must first be reviewed by the local competent authority and reported to the central competent authority for approval. When public utility prices must be adjusted, the proposed price adjustment should be repeatedly requested to be verified by the local competent authority and forwarded to the central competent authority for record, but at most once a month, and the adjustment should begin at the beginning of the month. Those who sell tickets or charge fees may adjust them from the first day of the month. The local competent authority should examine the actual local needs at the time of the price calculated according to the formula and may increase or decrease it appropriately, but the increase or decrease rate is limited to 10%. If local public utilities believe that the implementation of the calculation formula is obstructed, they may report the difficulties in detail to the local competent authority and forward them to the central competent authority and this committee for revision. The calculation formulas all have explanations for each item for easy application. Unless otherwise stipulated in the explanations, these notes shall be followed.</p>
<h3>National Government Promulgates University Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] National Government Order: The University Law is hereby formulated and promulgated (see the full text on page 2 of this newspaper on December 23 and 24).

<h3>Inspection of Opium and Drug Trafficking Joint Measures Planned by Ministry of Interior and Submitted for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] In order to prevent the inflow of opium and drugs from Communist bandit areas and remote areas, and to prevent the entry of foreign opium and drugs, the Ministry of Interior has consulted with the Ministry of National Defense and relevant agencies and believes that it is necessary to implement strict inspections. Therefore, it has drafted the "Contact Measures for Local Governments and Military Police to Inspect Opium and Drugs in Various Provinces, Cities, and Counties" and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for circulation to various provinces and cities for implementation. The measures are as follows: All unified inspection agencies for various land and water transportation have been ordered to be abolished. Opium and drug inspection belongs to the general scope of social inspection. The principle is not to set up special agencies. Opium and drug inspection offices or similar agencies that have been set up in various provinces and cities should be abolished. However, in remote provinces or places bordering neighboring countries that are transit distribution centers for opium and drugs, if there are indeed special circumstances and it is necessary to set up special interception agencies, the provincial and municipal governments may draft measures and report them to the Ministry of Interior in conjunction with the Ministry of National Defense for verification and forwarding to the Executive Yuan for approval to set up opium and drug inspection offices or checkpoints. Local police and garrison troops should be invited to send personnel to participate, and they should be abolished when the original special circumstances disappear. At major traffic arteries or important cities and towns, where military police perform security checks or general inspections, the local anti-opium agencies may, if they deem it necessary, designate police officers to participate in the inspections. When military vehicles, ships, aircraft, or other transportation vehicles pass through, if the local anti-opium agency has prior reliable clues about opium and drug trafficking or discovers suspicious signs, and there is no organization that regularly performs security tasks or general inspections in the area, it should jointly conduct temporary inspections with the highest security agency and the local military police to ensure strictness. At ordinary times, the local anti-opium investigation agencies should investigate and inspect suspicious items and remote paths for drug trafficking in various ways according to their responsibilities to avoid omissions.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office Decides on Measures to Expedite the Handling of Traitor Cases</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] The Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office has recently made the following decisions to expedite the handling of traitor cases: Cases where property has been seized but no prosecution is filed should be unsealed and returned immediately.

<h3>Wuxi Also Stops Selling Loose Rice, Common People Feel Panic, Food Prices in Sichuan Province Generally Fall</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wuxi, 11th] The rice market has been deadlocked for four days. Because the authorities have rigidly stipulated a price limit of 1.18 million, each rice store has stopped selling loose rice, and the general public has felt panic.

<h3>Shen Xirui Talks About Taiwan's Economy, Coordination Between Various Business Institutions Can Avoid Any Crisis</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Shen Xirui, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, believes that the economic problems facing the province are not as serious as rumored. If coordination can be achieved between the various business institutions in Taiwan Province, any crisis can be avoided. Shen, who has been in Taiwan for ten days, made a statement after a detailed investigation and research, saying, "The province is not blessed by nature." Various industries are completely based on artificial forces. Over the past two years, the government has sent specialized talents and allocated huge amounts of funds. Various industries have gradually been able to restore their original production capacity. In the future, if coordination can be achieved between the various business institutions in Taiwan Province, whether in terms of management or financial resources, if they can help each other, then the various difficult problems that are currently facing can be solved by themselves. For the remaining difficult points, the Central Government can be asked for assistance. He also said that the province has now shifted from focusing on trade to focusing on production, which is very important and very correct. Regarding the supply and demand of materials in Taiwan Province, those that were matched with Japan in the past must be matched with our country in the future. Shen was ordered by Zhang Jiaao to investigate the economic situation in the province. He has been very busy discussing matters these days. On the evening of the 10th, he met with Chairman Wei Daoming again, and on the 11th, he rushed back to Shanghai to meet with Bei Zuyi.

<h3>Key Points of the Draft Implementation Measures for the Economic Program's Water Conservancy Sector</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The draft implementation measures for the economic reform program's water conservancy sector have also been drafted by relevant agencies. The key points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the relevant provisions of the economic reform program and the implementation measures of the water conservancy construction outline, and in response to objective environmental needs, the main objectives of water conservancy construction are the following five, with plans to implement them in five-year phases, prioritizing them based on urgency and importance.</p>
<p>1. Concerning the fundamental treatment of major rivers:</p>
<p>For major rivers with existing fundamental treatment plans, funds should be allocated from the national treasury or foreign investment should be utilized to begin implementation immediately. For those without complete fundamental treatment plans, efforts should be accelerated to complete them within a set timeframe.</p>
<p>Implementation methods: 1. Focus on the fundamental management of major rivers nationwide to eliminate water disasters and revitalize water conservancy. 2. The fundamental treatment plans for major rivers should be based on various data, considering "control," "universalization," "dredging," "excavation," and embankment and river management methods in detail through careful surveys, planning, comparisons, and calculations. 3. The greatest objective of Yellow River management is flood prevention and irrigation, supplemented by hydropower development and navigation channel improvement; the fundamental treatment plan should be actively completed within a set timeframe. 4. The fundamental treatment plan for the Yangtze River should focus on shipping and hydropower, while also considering flood regulation and irrigation utilization; the plan should be completed as soon as possible; important tributaries should be planned and implemented accordingly. 5. The Huai River should first complete the Huai River diversion and flood prevention project, while also developing shipping and irrigation projects. 6. The fundamental treatment plan for the Yongding River should be implemented immediately. 7. The fundamental treatment plans for other major rivers should be formulated and implemented according to their respective urgency and importance.</p>
<p>2. Concerning irrigation development:</p>
<p>Approximately 250 million mu of arable land nationwide is suitable for developing or improving irrigation systems. In the past, the government was limited by funds, and agricultural loans were limited, making large-scale implementation impossible. In the future, in addition to agricultural products, water conservancy bonds should be approved for issuance or other methods should be explored based on the needs of each province to increase funding and facilitate progress. Implementation methods: (A) The state allocates funds for projects. 1. The government should find ways to improve existing large-scale irrigation projects and actively allocate funds to develop new irrigation projects, paying particular attention to the northwestern provinces. The first five-year phase will focus on irrigation projects in the Yellow River region, including the eight provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Qinghai, with an irrigation area of 9.97 million mu; the inland sea region, including Hexi in Gansu and Xinjiang, with a total of 3.6 million mu; the Bai River region, including the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Chahar, with a total of 3.35 million mu; the Huai River region, including the three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu, with a total of 4.11 million mu; the Yangtze River and Lancang River regions, including the ten provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, with a total of 16.07 million mu; the Liao River region, including the two provinces of Liaoning and Jehol, with a total of 660,000 mu; the Songhua River region, Jilin, with 780,000 mu; totaling 38.54 million mu. 1.5 million mu can be completed ahead of schedule in the first year. 2. The funds needed for irrigation projects in the first year will be allocated by the government from the farmland water conservancy fund for reserve; after the completion of the project, water fees will be collected from the benefited farmland in installments to repay the principal and interest for cyclical use. 3. The audit standards for irrigation projects are based on the principles of complete plans, superior benefits, convenient construction conditions, and completion within three years. 4. Project construction is carried out in two ways: by the central competent authority and by local governments. 5. After the completion of the project, the local government is responsible for management and maintenance. 6. For projects completed with the fund, the provincial government will be responsible for collecting consumption the following year. The water fees collected, in addition to being used for management and maintenance, will be used to repay the central government's project funds first, and the remainder will be used as local farmland water conservancy funds. (B) Agricultural loans are used to carry out projects. 1. Nonghang should increase agricultural water conservancy loans in areas urgently in need of irrigation construction in the 37th year and use cooperative societies in various provinces and counties to promote well and pond loans universally. 2. Projects that have not been completed in various provinces should be accelerated and completed within a set timeframe; those that have been completed should be properly managed and maintained. The principal and interest should be repaid starting the year after the completion of the project. 3. The loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and the use of the loan should be supervised. 4. Reduce the current loan interest rate to enable various provinces to universally carry out irrigation projects. 5. After the loan, each province should quickly establish a sound construction organization and complete the project on schedule according to the plan. (C) Supervise local governments to carry out irrigation projects. 1. Local governments may apply for the issuance of water conservancy bonds as local farmland water conservancy funds, and the local government shall set up a fund management committee. 2. Supervise the governments of various provinces and counties to use slack farming seasons to launch voluntary labor to universally construct irrigation canals and well-digging pond projects and carry out work competitions. 3. For larger irrigation projects that people cannot build on their own, they can apply for small farmland water conservancy loans and the local government will assist in the process. 4. Set up water conservancy engineering teams in important irrigation areas to assist and guide the people in building on their own and provide appropriate loans. 5. In the arid areas of Northwest, Northeast, and North China, focus on well projects, and in the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, focus on pond digging and pumping irrigation and drainage projects. 6. For completed projects, supervise and guide the beneficiary farmers to form water conservancy associations for management and maintenance.</p>
<p>3. Concerning river management and protection:</p>
<p>Although flood prevention focuses on the fundamental management of various rivers, the symptomatic methods should also be given special attention to protect farmland, people's lives, and production.</p>
<p>Implementation methods: 1. Pay attention to the management and protection of various rivers to prevent floods. 2. The competent authorities should pay attention to guarding and strictly prevent breaches, and local officials should organize the masses to prepare materials locally and be responsible for participating in the work. 3. The dikes damaged during the war and those that have not been repaired should be repaired to reach one meter above the highest flood level. 4. The culverts and sluices damaged during the war should be repaired immediately, and those that have not been built should be built as soon as possible. 5. The silted rivers and waterways blocked during the war should be dredged quickly. 6. The following projects should be completed in the first five-year phase: rebuild or repair the dikes of the lower Yellow River; complete the dike projects of the Huai River, Yangtze River, Han River, and North China rivers; complete the dike and sluice projects of the lower Pearl River and Han River; repair the dike projects of the main and tributary streams of the Liao River.</p>
<p>4. Concerning waterway management:</p>
<p>Most of China's major rivers flow from west to east and are rarely interconnected. More north-south canals should be opened to create a network of waterways; inland river ports should be used as strongholds, seaports should be used as hubs between land and sea, and transportation between the north and south rivers and seas should be convenient. Implementation methods: 1. Focus on waterway management, the opening of canals and harbors, and seek to connect water and land transportation. 2. When managing waterways, priority should be given to trunk lines with important economic value for transportation or those that can be combined with other water conservancy construction. 3. Priority should be given to opening canals that connect two adjacent river systems. 4. When opening harbors, they should be coordinated with the water and land transportation network, and priority should be given to harbor projects at the intersection of water and land. 5. Waterways and harbors damaged during the war should be completed as soon as possible, and the navigation depth should be maintained at its necessary scale as a minimum. 6. The waterways that have been managed during the war should be continued and managed and maintained separately. 7. The following projects should be carried out in the first five-year phase: manage waterways and new canals, including the Songliao, Liaohe, Jinshi, Yingkou, Jinbao, and Huangwei canals, and the Yellow River, Wei River, Grand Canal, Huai River, Wei River, Min River, Jialing River, Han River, Xiang River, Gui River, Gan River, Wen River, Qu River, and Xun River, a total of approximately 7,800 kilometers, so that ships of 300 to 1,000 tons can navigate. The inland river ports to be built include Hanyang, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xinxiang, Baotou, Ningxia, Tongguan, Xi'an, Zhenjiang, and the Longhai Railway Canal Station, but 31 locations including Weiyin, Bengbu, Zhengyangguan, Xinpu, Chenjiagang, Yichang, Chongqing, Luxian, Yibin, Leshan, Guangyuan, Xiangyang, Laohekou, Nanzheng, Guilin, Hukou, Nanchang, Ganxian, Nanping, Wuzhou, and Nanling should be completed first. In terms of seaports, the southern major ports, Shanghai, Qinzhou, Yingkou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Xingao Port, Shantou, Dianbai, Dadongjing, Qinhuangdao, Longkou, Yanwei, Lyutian Port, Shipu, Funing, Mawei, and Yulin, totaling 19 locations, should be expanded.</p>
<p>5. Concerning water resources development:</p>
<p>Although China is rich in hydropower reserves, it is still in its infancy. The existing 750,000 kilowatts of hydropower are mostly in the Northeast and Taiwan. In the future, development should be coordinated with the needs of agriculture and industry, and appropriate locations should be selected.</p>
<p>Implementation methods: 1. Hydropower development should be coordinated with flood prevention, harbor, waterway, and irrigation projects of various rivers. 2. When selecting factory sites, priority should be given to the needs of industry. 3. In the first five-year phase, the southwestern provinces will be prioritized for development, with a focus on the Xianggui area. 4. For the Northeast hydropower industry, the initial goal is to restore the power generation capacity when it was under enemy control. 5. In addition to those that should be restored immediately, the projects in Taiwan's hydropower industry that have not been completed should also be reviewed for necessity and selected for resumption of work. 6. The Yongli undertakings in other regions should be developed separately depending on the needs of the situation, with varying degrees of urgency and importance. 7. Private hydropower enterprises should be rewarded and assisted. 8. 748,000 kilowatts of hydropower will be developed in various regions in the first five-year phase.</p>

<h3>U.S. Fiscal Budget for 1949: Truman Submits to Congress; Totaling $40 Billion, Including Aid to Europe and Loans to China; Taft Expresses Desire to Reduce It</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Congressional Republicans rejected President Truman's tax increase plan on the 10th in order to attack the draft budget to be presented on the 12th. According to informed sources, Truman is requesting $40 billion in appropriations for government expenses for the year beginning July 1. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber stated, "This number is too high" and should be reduced. Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft stated that the Republicans will make every effort to reduce government spending. He said, "Expenditures, including the Marshall Plan, must be 'absolutely necessary.'"</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The U.S. fiscal year 1948 will end on June 30 of this year. President Truman submitted a total budget of $39,668,993,983 for the fiscal year 1949 to Congress on the 11th. Truman requested Congress to appropriate $1.27 billion for government expenses and relief expenditures in occupied areas. This exceeds this year's budget by $310 million. The main reason for the increase in expenditure is due to the cost of the U.S. in the American occupied zone of Germany. The budget submitted by the President includes $748,679,482 for the purchase of grains and agricultural products. Truman allocated $112,373,529 to purchase agricultural supplies and fertilizers, and $90,760,993 to purchase petroleum and petroleum products. Truman stated that the United States must have huge expenditures abroad to prevent the "expansion of totalitarian rule." The budget includes $9 billion for worldwide aid programs, including $6.8 billion for the first 15 months of the Marshall Four-Year Plan, and includes $1.25 billion in relief funds for the U.S. Army in occupied countries, and $750 million to aid "several countries under other international aid programs, including China," $71 million for the International Refugee Organization, and $132 million for Philippine rehabilitation and wartime losses. A year ago, Truman stated that large-scale foreign aid undertakings were "mostly over." At that time, he only requested $250,000 to aid a small number of countries. This budget proposal contrasts sharply with Truman's words and deeds at that time. Truman said on the 11th: "The new international plan is our response to the unprecedented challenge. If the international plan fails, totalitarian rule will expand further. At that time, we will re-examine our security plan. Under pressure, we will take all necessary measures. If Europe once succumbs to totalitarian rule, then the United States will increase its military strength, and its expenditure will be even greater than the international aid plan currently submitted to Congress." Truman promised to submit to Congress a "positive recommendation" for a new foreign aid plan including China in the short term. In this respect, the budget exceeds the Marshall Plan by $750,000. It is estimated that China can receive approximately $300 million. Although Truman did not mention the names of other countries, it is generally believed that Korea can receive $75 million.</p>
<h3>Widespread Implementation of the Marshall Plan: Tensions Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union Increase; U.S. Administrative Authorities Publicly Acknowledge</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. authorities admitted on the 10th that the Marshall Plan added fuel to the already tense relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but the authorities firmly opposed Congress's opinion that the plan was too expensive. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, who was also "selling" the Marshall Plan in Congress, was questioned by the bipartisan members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for three hours. He firmly supported the opinion of the administrative authorities, that is, that a European economy built with U.S. aid can achieve "lasting peace." Douglas only admitted that the United States' determination to implement this extensive recovery plan will inevitably cause the Soviet Union to launch a new propaganda offensive. The administrative authorities plan to allocate $6.8 billion in the first 15 months and a total of $17 billion in four years.</p>
<h3>Countries Receiving U.S. Aid: The U.S. Will Send Cooperation Officials; Douglas Announced in the Senate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] U.S. Ambassador to London Douglas reiterated his views to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is examining the Marshall European Recovery Program, on the 10th. When answering questions from Democratic Senator George, he stated that trade between the United States and European countries under the Marshall Plan should be conducted through private, non-governmental channels as much as possible. He also stated that the United States will send one "Economic Cooperation Official" to the embassy of each of the 16 countries receiving assistance. Those sent to larger countries will be ministerial-level officials, and those sent to smaller countries will be counselor-level officials. The State Department plans to send 900 officials dedicated to implementing the Marshall Plan, of which 400 will be stationed abroad and 500 will remain in the country. Douglas also specifically pointed out that resistance to communism west of the Iron Curtain has increased due to the imminent availability of U.S. aid.</p>
<h3>The U.S. State Department Agrees to Divide Aid to Europe Funds: Divided into Two Types: Relief and Recovery</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] At the request of the Senate, the U.S. State Department agreed today to calculate how much of the aid to Europe plan will be used for relief and how much will be used for recovery, and agreed to the Senate's estimate that $2.8 billion of the $6.8 billion requested by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall for the first 15 months can be recovered through debt repayment. According to State Department spokesman Douglas's statement to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg, the relief and recovery aspects of the aid to Europe plan are almost inseparable, but he promised to provide this report within the next week.</p>
<h3>Serious Strike Wave: Conflicts Between Police and Workers; Bank Employees' Strike Mediation Fails</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 10th] After 60,000 bank workers went on strike for eleven days, the third mediation on the 10th failed. The General Confederation of Labor publicly declared that if the government does not immediately force the banks to make concessions, it will implement a nationwide general strike. Millions of workers have been unable to receive their salaries on time due to the strike, and this is the second week. In Frosinone, north of this, fights broke out during the Stojah general strike, and six workers and six policemen were injured. Three hundred demonstrators hid behind obstacles and used hand grenades and automatic rifles to deal with the police's tear gas and tear gas bombs. The police finally opened fire, and the strikers dispersed.</p>
<h3>French Political and Labor Leaders Form a Center Group</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] French political and labor leaders formally organized a "Third Force" after talks on the 11th in order to find a middle ground between the two extremes of the Communist Party and General de Gaulle.

Most of the members are from the Léon Blum faction and some Radical Party members.</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Invites Industrial Giants to Discuss National Defense Matters; State Department Orders Ban on Radar Exports</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The government invited 15 top industrial leaders to a meeting on the 10th to help the country if a future war breaks out. Defense Secretary Forrestal asked them to hold a meeting with the National Security Resources Board next Wednesday to plan the government's future industrial mobilization plan. The Bureau was established in accordance with the Military Unification Act of last year.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] A report by the Aircraft Industries Association in response to the Congressional Aviation Policy Bureau stated that 70 percent of the aircraft currently used by the U.S. Army and Navy are outdated, but there are no new aircraft to replace them, so they are still flying.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The U.S. State Department ordered a ban on the export of war surplus radar on the 10th because Republican Congressman Ross protested that some radar had been imported into the Soviet Union. National Armaments Control Bureau Executive Secretary Kim Minns stated that radar will now be classified as military equipment and will not be allowed to be exported without a special permit. This move means that radar used in the war may not be exported to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in the future. Palestine is also a country to which arms are banned.</p>
<h3>Britain Concludes Regional Military Alliances with Arab Countries Separately; Renegotiation of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Britain's compliance with Middle Eastern public opinion and its engagement in treaty amendment negotiations with Iraq, Transjordan, and Egypt have attracted Moscow's attention. The TASS correspondent in Cairo recently stated that Britain's goal is to conclude a regional military alliance with the Arab countries, but the instructions received in London are that the almost simultaneous holding of these treaty amendment negotiations is only a coincidence in time and has no other function.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Britain and Iraq have agreed to conclude a new alliance treaty to replace the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. The draft treaty was signed by Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr and British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the Foreign Office in London today. Formal signing procedures will be held next week, and then its contents will be announced.</p>
<p>According to informed sources, Britain has made significant concessions to Iraq in the new treaty, including the abolition of the rights stipulated in the original treaty for Britain to station troops at the Habbaniyah and Shaiba airfields in Iraq during peacetime, enjoy extraterritorial jurisdiction, and other conveniences. In the future, control of these two airfields will be transferred to Iraq, but Britain will still be allowed to use these two airfields until other suitable landing sites are available. The provisions of the new treaty will be fully discussed in Parliament after the British Lower House reconvenes on the 20th of this month. The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 stipulated the end of British mandate in Iraq and recognized Iraq's independence. The renegotiation talks began on Wednesday of this week, and the discussion focused on the fifth clause of the treaty. This clause, in addition to stating that the King of Iraq acknowledges that defending the United Kingdom's lines of communication is beneficial to the United Kingdom and Iraq itself, also allows Britain to use the above-mentioned two airfields and station troops in these two locations. The negotiations also involved the military appendix to the 1930 treaty, which stipulated that British troops in Iraq would enjoy certain privileges, including tax exemption and convenience of action and training. The military appendix also stipulated that Britain would sell military supplies and equipment to the Iraqi government and provide the Iraqi army with training facilities. The basic provision of the 1930 treaty is that the signatory countries shall not conclude treaties against each other and shall provide mutual assistance and convenience in the event of war. Except for the Royal Air Force units stationed at the Habbaniyah and Shaiba airfields and the British military delegation stationed in Baghdad, there are no other British troops in Iraq. The last batch of British troops stationed in Iraq due to the war withdrew in October last year. After the Anglo-Iraqi treaty amendment negotiations, a delegation from Transjordan is also scheduled to come to Britain this month to negotiate amendments to the Anglo-Transjordanian Treaty of 1946. Observers also expect the British government to make a positive attempt to break the stalemate in the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations.</p>
<h3>Following Prime Minister Attlee, Morrison Denounces the Soviet Union: Atrocities of Violence and Destruction of Democracy Are Unforgivable</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison delivered the first important speech on British policy toward the Soviet Union by a key member of the British cabinet since the new year at the Labor Party conference here today, severely criticizing the false and malicious attacks on Britain by the Soviet Communist Party and the willingness of communist parties around the world to become outposts of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Morrison said that the Soviet Communist Party is adopting a new form of imperialism, threatening the welfare and way of life of other European countries. He said: "Our greatest wish is to cooperate with the Soviet Union to maintain peace and promote the welfare of mankind, but we cannot forever turn a blind eye to the false and malicious attacks on us by the Soviet Communist propaganda machine and the willingness of communist parties around the world to become automatic outposts of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One after another, countries in Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe have been placed under undemocratic and unrepresentative governments, while other political parties have been severely oppressed, freedom of the press has been frequently destroyed, and non-communist political leaders have been illegally executed. We are not only deeply saddened by this destruction of people's livelihood and human freedom, but also cannot help but feel indignant. What is even more painful is that these false and violent methods are actually advertised as democracy, freedom, and socialism.</p>
<h3>Pravda Criticizes Attlee's Anti-Soviet Remarks in an Article</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 11th] A French embassy spokesman said that French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, will lodge an oral protest with the State Department next Monday regarding the establishment of a new economic regime in the British and American zones of Germany. It is expected that Bonnet will inform the State Department that the French government believes that Britain and the United States should not make independent decisions on the establishment of a West German government before France, Britain, and the United States discuss the possibility of merging the three occupation zones of Germany in Berlin. Diplomatic circles here are deeply concerned that France's protest will delay the Berlin negotiations and undermine their hopes for success.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 11th] The Soviet official newspaper here reported on the 11th that the Soviet Union plans to force the United States and Britain to withdraw from Berlin.

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The British Labour Party will invite socialist parties participating in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, including representatives from Germany and Austria, to a conference. Representatives from France and Belgium advocated that the committee convene a socialist conference on the Marshall Plan. The United Kingdom believed that this move would cause conflict between socialist parties in the East and West. As a result, the Socialist International Committee rejected the French and Belgian proposal by a vote of eleven to five. The Socialist parties of Britain and the Scandinavian countries joined the Eastern European countries in voting against it.</p>
<p>The International Socialist Conference has completed all of its work today, so it will no longer hold meetings on Sunday. Resolutions passed at the meeting included scheduling a plenary session of the Socialist International Congress in Vienna from June 4th to 6th, and establishing a subcommittee to supervise the finances and administration of the Socialist Information and Liaison Bureau, consisting of representatives from Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. Observers attach great importance to the British Labour Party's invitation to Western European socialist representatives to hold a conference, believing that the talks have significant implications for the British government's European policy and the future cooperation of the International Socialist Conference. The Labour Party must have obtained the consent of the British government before initiating this event.</p>

<h3>The Socialist Party is in a Difficult Situation; Katayama Cabinet Will Collapse</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Due to recent political developments, Tets Katayama's Socialist Democratic Party is facing a severe situation. Katayama's coalition cabinet appears likely to collapse by the end of this month. Katayama told a Central News Agency reporter alone that the situation within the party is extremely bad due to Rikizo Hirano's departure from the party. At the same time, the number of right-wing members of the Socialist Democratic Party has decreased since the departure of the Hirano faction, and the right-wing's control within the party has also weakened, further empowering the party's left wing. The key to the current political interregnum in Japan is the attitude of the Central Purge Committee towards the Hirano case. Katayama and his cabinet secretary-general, Suehiro Nishio, both hope that the Central Purge Committee will purge Hirano, in order to give the Social Democratic Party a chance to breathe and stabilize the party's internal organization.</p>

<h3>Police Department Investigation Team Leader's Embezzlement Case: Qi Zaiyu and Others Transferred to Military Law Department</h3>
<p>Numerous offenses have been revealed, with at least two cases already exposed. Commander Xuan has telegraphed Chairman Chiang to request instructions on handling the matter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] Qi Zaiyu, the Sixth Investigation Team Leader of the Songhu Garrison Command Investigation Department, is suspected of extortion, embezzlement, and fraud. After being reported by victims to Commander Tie Wu Xuan, Commander Xuan sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts. On the 5th, he ordered Qi Zaiyu to be brought to the Investigation Department and detained. Jin Runsheng (also known as "Gold Hunchback," Qi's powerful assistant) and seven other accomplices involved in the Qi case were arrested by Inspector Lu Peng on the 5th. After a detailed interrogation, the group of offenders was transferred to the Military Law Department for trial on the 10th.</p>
<p>Qi Zaiyu was known for his intelligence and competence in the Sixth Team, handling or co-handling various cases, and was highly valued by his superiors. Commander Xuan was enraged by the incident and did not show any leniency, a forceful move to rectify discipline. According to a reporter, Qi committed numerous offenses, and multiple crimes have been exposed this time. Two cases have already been revealed: On December 16th of last year, he extorted 455 million yuan from Wu Baokang, the owner of the Baokang Wireless Electric Material Shop in this city, using this money as the year-end bonus for some personnel of the Sixth Team. Qi himself received 60 million yuan. Jin Runsheng, his assistant, facilitated the extortion. Qi secretly reported to the Investigation Department that Wu Baokang had more than a hundred military telephones of unknown origin, requesting that Baokang be summoned for questioning. After the extortion was successful, he reported that the previous secret report was not true. This was reported to Commander Xuan by Wu Baokang as a victim. A Japanese man named Yokoi was a driver for the Hirai Group of the former Japanese Fourth Division (numbered "Noboru Unit") and was responsible for purchasing automobile materials. After the war, he was retained in Shanghai. Introduced by someone to Qi's driver, Qi employed Yokoi and extorted large sums of money from Japanese expatriates in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Stall Vendors Along the Two Railways Petition: Bureau Agrees to Consider</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In view of the fact that stall vendors along the railway lines sell unsanitary food, which is detrimental to the health of passengers, and that the stall vendors are not properly dressed and poorly managed, which detracts from the appearance of the stations, the Railway Bureau has decided to ban them and take over the business itself. It has decided to add station restaurants at the four major stations of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang to provide food and drinks to passengers. It will hire forty new station vendors and assign them to the four stations. The new station vendors will all wear white uniforms and red and white hard-brimmed hats and will be dedicated to selling various foods that have been inspected by the Railway Bureau. However, after the implementation of this measure, the livelihoods of more than two hundred old stall vendors at the four stations have been cut off, causing widespread panic. They have repeatedly sent representatives to the relevant departments of the Railway Bureau and the special party headquarters of the Two Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other agencies to submit petitions requesting permission to continue operating for one year and volunteering to accept the Railway Bureau's regulations and improve their operations.

<h3>Shen Bao Launches Readers' Student Aid Fund Again</h3>
<p>Dear Readers: If you are not forgetful, I think you will definitely remember the "Readers' Student Aid Fund" held by this newspaper four months ago. Time flies, and the winter vacation is approaching again. Facing us is a more urgent and serious problem: the problem of rescuing out-of-school youth. Objective conditions clearly show us that this movement still needs to continue. Due to the continuous rise in prices, every citizen feels economic panic, and students are no exception.</p>
<p>Young students are the future pillars of society and the country, and they need people's assistance everywhere. However, in this difficult situation, although most people feel that making a living is difficult, on the other hand, we clearly see that there are countless wealthy people who are still living extravagant lives. The money they spend every day is enough for a college student's entire year's expenses. We have decided to start today to once again solicit donations from our readers for the "Student Aid Fund" in order to rescue countless out-of-school youth when the next semester begins.</p>
<p>We hope that enthusiastic readers will provide more assistance to poor students. For example, when you encounter celebratory gatherings, you may wish to think about saving money from frugality and donating it to the student aid fund. In particular, "collective donations" from various industries and businesses are the most welcome, as they are easy to achieve with the participation of the community. In short, those with strength should contribute strength, and those with money should contribute money. The effects are the same. —(Please send donations to the Social Service Section of this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Solicitation of Donations Begins Today</h3>
<h3>Two Airlines Send Urgent Telegrams to the Ministry of Transportation: Requesting Effective Control of Oil Prices</h3>
<p>It is learned that three gasoline companies raised aviation gasoline prices by 10% on the 1st of this month, and yesterday notified China and Central Companies that they would raise them again by 22% starting yesterday. Since the beginning of the year, air ticket prices have not been adjusted, but the price of aviation fuel has risen twice within ten days, causing considerable strain on the airlines. (Airlines currently have to pay 35% of their revenue for fuel) In particular, the unlimited timing and quantity of price increases leave airlines with no way to prepare. Yesterday, both companies sent urgent telegrams to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation and President Zhang of the Central Bank, requesting that effective control measures be taken as soon as possible. Otherwise, airfares will be stimulated by rising fuel prices and will have to be adjusted at any time. As a result, general prices will be affected, and the cycle will continue, affecting the national economy, with unimaginable consequences.</p>
<h3>Fake Refugees Are Heartless: Infiltrating Chao Hui Mountain Villa and Other Places, Embezzling Clothing for Self-Enrichment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It has recently been discovered among the refugees in this city that local ruffians and thugs have infiltrated the group. These people rely on their special labor and take advantage of the fact that genuine refugees who have fled to Shanghai from other places are unfamiliar with the area and are easy to deceive. They claim to be representatives of the refugees and monopolize all relief matters, embezzling money and goods distributed by the government and donated by the public, causing serious impact on the benefits received by genuine refugees. These people are exploiting genuine refugees who are on the brink of death for their own enrichment, and their behavior is extremely despicable. It is now learned that the authorities have paid attention to this and have ordered a secret investigation. A few days ago, several fake refugees who had embezzled clothing were arrested in refugee settlements such as Chao Hui Mountain Villa and will be sent to judicial organs for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>New Measures Will Be Taken to Stabilize Grain Prices: Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food Comes to Shanghai to Exchange Opinions; Unregistered Rice Shops Ordered to Cease Operations</h3>
<p>Minister of Food Yu Feipeng arrived in Shanghai from the capital yesterday morning and met with Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to exchange opinions on the city's food problems for two hours. It is learned that major issues have been largely agreed upon, and Yu returned to the capital by night due to important official business. Director Wang of the Ministry of Food, who came with Minister Yu, will temporarily stay in Shanghai to assist in dealing with the city's food problems. In addition to assisting the city authorities in stabilizing grain prices and determining policies, Yu's mission discussed matters related to the prices and supply of rice and flour in the Yangtze River area. Mayor Wu, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Standing Committee Member Ren Xianqun of the People's Food Distribution Committee, and Director Wang of the Ministry of Food are scheduled to convene a meeting with the managers of the city's North and South markets at 9:00 AM today. It is heard that new measures will be announced regarding the supply and prices of rice in the city. According to reliable sources, the authorities decided yesterday to ban some illegal rice shops in the city that have not obtained a grain merchant registration certificate from the Social Affairs Bureau. There are a total of 2,200 rice shops in the city, but only 1,600 have obtained a grain merchant registration certificate. More than 600 have not yet completed the procedures. The city government will notify them to cease operations today. If they do not comply, it will enforce the order.</p>
<h3>Legislative Committee Candidates Launch Campaign War</h3>

When the War of Resistance broke out, she took on important positions in the city's Anti-Enemy Support Association, traveling around and inspiring the people, and her contributions were particularly great. After Shanghai fell into enemy hands, in a dangerous environment, she resolutely took on underground work and fought against the enemy puppets. She published the China Women's Monthly, advocating that women be loyal to the country, which had a significant effect. Two years ago, the National Government elected her as a representative to the National Assembly, and she is currently a member of the Central Women's Movement Committee and the Director of the Municipal Women's Movement Committee.</p>

Wang explained the importance of the Constitution and the people, moving the audience. Wang made many contributions to Shanghai's anti-traitor work and public security after the victory, and the people of Shanghai have benefited from his efforts, so they unanimously expressed their support for Wang as a legislator.</p>
<p>Xie Renzhao</p>
<p>Xie Renzhao, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, will give a campaign speech at the Hubei Grand Theater in Zhabei at 9:00 AM tomorrow, entitled "Why I am Running for Legislative Committee Member."</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Donations Received Nearly 20 Billion</h3>
<p>According to the Winter Relief Committee Fundraising Committee, since the launch of the fundraising campaign, donations received have reached more than 19.144495 billion yuan. The above donations have been successively delivered to the Winter Relief Committee for overall planning, distribution, and utilization. The donations from the Western film charity screenings and the sugar industry are still being solicited. In addition, the donations from the issuance of charity housing lottery tickets are expected to far exceed the achievements of general fundraising, so the disaster relief funds for winter refugees in this city have all been secured.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Civil Servant Salaries: City Government Employee Salaries Increase by 70 Million</h3>
<p>The city government's budget for this year has been completely revised by the city's accounting office, with a total amount of over 1.3 trillion yuan. According to Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongqian, speaking to reporters, starting this month, after the central government approved adjustments to civil servant salaries, the expenditure for city government employee salaries, which was originally 60 billion yuan per month, is estimated to increase by 70 billion yuan based on the rumored civil servant index of over 80,000 times after the adjustment. The total monthly expenditure for salaries alone will be 130 billion yuan. Therefore, the expenditure for employee salaries alone this year will require over 1.6 trillion yuan, exceeding the city government's revised budget this time, which will inevitably require a supplementary budget.</p>
<h3>Melancholy Music and Solemn Rituals: Ye Chucang's Coffin Transported to Gusu; Burial Set for Tomorrow at Lingyan Mountain Cemetery</h3>
<p>The late Kuomintang Committee Member and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Mr. Ye Chucang, passed away in Shanghai two years ago. His coffin was temporarily placed in the China Funeral Home.

You were born in Suzhou, blessed with the essence of nature, answering the call of destiny, a wise and virtuous man was born.

A virtuous man, the foundation of the nation, heaven is unfair, why did you leave us? The Party loses a pioneer, the country mourns a great man, all regions grieve, the stars dim.

<h3>Symposium of Fishery Groups Bitterly Complains of Imminent Crisis: Fishery Administration Should Produce Dried and Salted Fish for Sale Instead of Fresh Fish</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fishery Trade Association, the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Fishing Vessel Trade Association, the Shanghai Fishermen's Association, the Joint Office of the National Fishery Corporation, the Zhejiang Aquaculture Construction Association, and the Shanghai Fish Market Brokers Association, six organizations, held a joint meeting with the Fishery Department Director Liu Faxuan, Councilor Hou Chaohai, and Advisor Jiang Weizhi of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, who came to Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Supervision Office investigated the dispute between the Lianying fishing vessels and private fishing operations, as well as the current national fishery crisis, the reasons for the factory closures, and provided opinions for the government to adopt. A fishery emergency symposium was held at 2:00 PM yesterday at Room 302, 210 Jiujiang Road, with over 30 representatives from various units attending. Lu Yanghao, the director of the National Fishery Federation, served as chairman, and spoke about the</p>
<p>difficult situation of the fishery industry, and pointed out the root cause of the dispute between the Lianying fishing vessels and private fishing operations. He stated: "Lianying is using Western propaganda to cover up its privileged status. Lianying fishing vessels are catching fish, causing an oversupply in the market. After the victory, our industry had 28 pairs of fishing vessels, each with a production of nearly 1,200 boxes, more than 500 boxes higher than before the war, which is sufficient to supply the Shanghai market</p>
<p>needs.</p>
<p>In July 1946, the Lianying vessels arrived in Shanghai. As of September 1947, Lianying had 46 fishing vessels at sea. The original intention was to use relief funds to engage in refrigerated facilities, manufacture fishery machinery, and build our fishery industry, but now they are devoting all their efforts to fishing, concentrating their catches in Shanghai for dumping, putting our fishery industry in a desperate situation. The current situation is not the original intention of the United Nations relief effort. Furthermore, the Fishery Administration uses the slogan "Everyone eats cheap fish" to cover up its fishing activities.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to prove it.</p>
<p>In November 1947, the Fishery Administration caught 350,000 catties of fish, receiving a total of 3 billion yuan. However, the Fishery Administration's monthly expenses are 15 billion yuan. With such huge expenses, the amount of fish caught is so small, so what is the average price per catty? It is truly appalling. Huang Zenshi, Zhu Wenkui, Hu Bifeng, and others also expressed their opinions. Finally, all representatives unanimously advocated that for the current fresh fish production, the private companies in this city are sufficient to supply the public's food needs. The government stipulated that the Fishery Administration should sell 500,000 catties of fish in the market every month, and this fresh fish should be processed into dried and salted fish for distribution throughout the country, which is in line with the principle of providing cheap food for the general public proposed by the Fishery Administration.</p>
<h3>Li Chen Photographic Charity Exhibition Held at the YMCA</h3>

<h3>Details of the Hong Pinliang Case</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Commercial Bank has issued a statement regarding the report on the 10th that Hong Pinliang, the former manager of the Shanghai West Branch of the Ningbo Commercial Bank, took advantage of his position to embezzle all the funds of Japanese people in the branch, and colluded with his superiors and subordinates to commit fraud and arbitrarily alter accounts. The head office stated that this is inconsistent with the facts. It is claimed that: "During the Anti-Japanese War, all banks were forced by the enemy and puppet forces to accept deposits. After the victory, all enemy and puppet deposits in the branches of our bank in the Shanghai area were compiled into a list in accordance with government regulations on January 15, 1946, and submitted to the Central Bank in full, and recorded in the special account for the receipt of cash from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. The accounts handled by Hong Pinliang, the former manager of the West Branch, were also thoroughly investigated by the liquidation office and found to be accurate and in order, with no signs of fraud."</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Java Plunge into a Tragic Fate</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Batavia, June 6th] Since the breakdown of negotiations between the Dutch and Indonesians on July 21st this year, and the subsequent outbreak of conflict, the lives of overseas Chinese in the interior of Java have become as fragile as a candle in the wind, a wandering soul at the bottom of a cauldron. The lines from Su Dongpo's poem, "My dreams circle the cloudy mountains, my heart like a deer; my soul flies through boiling broth and fire, my life like a chicken," perfectly describe the tragic situation of overseas Chinese in Java's interior today. According to rough estimates, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese directly or indirectly due to this war, and those who have been massacred, number no fewer than several thousand. The total number of refugees has reached over one hundred thousand. In just Re (the capital of Indonesia) alone, there are already six thousand, and in Solo, there are five thousand.</p>
<p>Chinese Refugee Center</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in the interior of Java have always been generous and upright, thrifty and law-abiding. Whether engaged in labor or commerce, they have always adhered to the law. They have absolutely no political inclinations. Their contributions have greatly benefited local prosperity. On the island of Java, there are over six hundred thousand overseas Chinese, who have always lived in harmony with the Indonesians. The large number of Chinese-Indonesian marriages is a testament to this. Java's current status is inseparable from the pioneering efforts of the overseas Chinese. However, since the surrender of the Japanese invaders and the rise of narrow nationalism in Indonesia, some militarists who claim to be building and developing the country have adopted the tyrannical policies of the Japanese occupation period, "imitating regulations and following Cao," as the guiding principles for the governance of the new Indonesian state. At the same time, many Japanese ringleaders have infiltrated various Indonesian military and political organs, carrying out their behind-the-scenes work, fueling the flames, sowing discord, and launching both overt and covert attacks. As a result, the close relationship between the Chinese and Indonesians has been damaged. In the end, the honest and law-abiding overseas Chinese have been unable to secure protection for their lives and property. They are being massacred and robbed at will, which is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Solemn Orders</p>
<p>Today, overseas Chinese in the interior of Java, not to mention those living in remote villages, cannot obtain protection from the Indonesian government. Even in Yogyakarta, the self-proclaimed capital of the Indonesian Republic, and Solo, the heart of the Indonesian Republic, there is no security to speak of.</p>
<p>Vice Consul Niu Shouchun's recent assignment to Yogyakarta was met with joy by the local overseas Chinese, like a traveler who has finally met long-lost parents after many years, overcome with mixed emotions. They welcomed Vice Consul Niu as a "lucky star" and "Bodhisattva." The Indonesian Republican government also considered it a great honor to have a diplomatic envoy from the great Republic of China stationed in their capital. The Indonesian government did not dare to slight their guest and specially designated a refined and elegant house at No. 8, Nisunika Mountain Street, as Niu's official residence. Earlier this month, Vice Consul Niu inspected the situation of the overseas Chinese and toured various ports. Many documents, clothes, and utensils were left in the official residence, and it was locked up. Who would have thought that just after he left Yogyakarta, an Indonesian major returning from the Malang front would forcibly move into Niu's residence? The Republican government's reception officer tried to negotiate with the major, but was scolded and humiliated by him, with no way to resolve the situation. Later, when the reception officer heard that Vice Consul Niu was about to return to Yogyakarta, he was so anxious that he paced back and forth, and had no choice but to report to the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Sharifuddin. Sharifuddin personally issued an order for the major to move out. However, the major ignored it. Finally, Sharifuddin, in desperation, used the name of the Minister of Defense to order the relocation, but the major still paid no attention. It is said that Sharifuddin personally went to investigate, but the major still arrogantly occupied the official residence. The Prime Minister of the Cabinet could do nothing about it and had to turn away. He hurriedly sought the prestige of fellow Chinese Li Zecheng, but was still unable to make the lower-ranking military officer obey the minimum level of discipline. The consulate of the Republic of China was brazenly occupied by a military officer, and civilian and military officials did not dare to touch it. How can we expect the Indonesian government to have the ability to protect the lives and property of our overseas Chinese?</p>
<p>Despite our diplomats' accusations in the Security Council against Indonesian thugs for massacring overseas Chinese, despite President Sukarno, Prime Minister Sharifuddin, and General Sudirman issuing orders to protect overseas Chinese, despite the chairman of the Masjumi Party, which is most actively anti-Chinese (the former Minister of the Interior), Mr. Lum, telling our reporters: "We now send senior cadres to the countryside every week to promote the idea of Chinese-Indonesian friendship," despite the fact that in the Yogyakarta city area, a portrait of our national father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, this historical giant, is hung high, with the words: "The Three Principles of the People advocate helping the independence of small ethnic groups," the lives of overseas Chinese still cannot be guaranteed in the slightest. Until now, we have never heard of the Indonesian government arresting or executing a single Indonesian thug who massacred or robbed overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>A Picture of Refugees</p>
<p>As I was writing this, a friend, Mr. Lin, whom I had not seen for eight years, came to visit. He had just fled from the other side of Cisadane. According to Mr. Lin, "About 4,000 overseas Chinese in Balumbang, Cililitan, Tarum, Dengok, Maye, Ciguye, Citras, Sasarengan, Yegawahe, Jagong, and other places were driven by Indonesians to Lengkasbitung. They were only allowed to carry one item and one piece of clothing. They were concentrated in the barren mountains and wilderness of Ciyolo and Narimbang, living alongside poisonous snakes, fierce beasts, and vicious mosquitoes. Since there were no people living in the mountains, the refugees collected leaves to build thatched huts to shelter from the rain and sun, temporarily using them as places to rest. The most pitiable were the refugees in Narimbang. Their clothes were already tattered and torn, and even using sacks to cover their bodies was difficult. They were living the lives of "primitive people!"</p>
<p>The lack of supplies in the interior of Java has reached an extreme. The little bit of goods and supplies left by our Chinese merchants have been requisitioned by the Indonesians in the name of "concentration," "military use," and "official use." Chinese factories and exquisite residences have all been requisitioned. According to reliable sources, the Indonesian have planted explosives in the Chinese factories and homes in Solo and Blitar, preparing to implement a "scorched earth" policy when the Dutch army launches another "police action." Who can guarantee that the war will not reignite? Who can trust the Indonesian government to restrain the evil elements? Who would naively expect the Indonesian army's headquarters to have the ability to control all armed groups?</p>
<p>The Batavia Chinese General Association is constantly broadcasting the facts of Indonesian thugs harming overseas Chinese to the world, urging all people with a sense of justice and the Indonesian government itself to face reality and jointly impose sanctions. As people living in safe areas, we think that overseas Chinese in the interior of Java must be so grateful and inspired to hear this broadcast! However, on the contrary, the compatriots in "dangerous countries" unanimously requested that the broadcasts of the Batavia Chinese General Association should try to avoid containing inflammatory language, so as to prevent the Indonesians from getting angry and causing the compatriots in the interior to suffer greatly, becoming objects of venting anger. Recently, there have been two extremely painful sayings circulating among overseas Chinese in the interior of Java: "Overseas Chinese standing in heaven should also think of the people in hell when they speak!"

<h3>After the Demolition of Wooden Houses in Kowloon: Miserable Overseas Chinese! Where to Settle?</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hong Kong, June 7th] After two months of negotiations regarding the Kowloon incident, the Hong Kong government finally mobilized police and workers on the morning of the 5th to demolish the residences in the city. The Hong Kong Chinese newspapers expressed much indignation at the weak negotiations by our diplomatic authorities and great regret for the Hong Kong government's sudden and unpleasant actions while both sides were pursuing diplomatic channels. The Hong Kong Chinese newspapers seemed to have exerted their greatest efforts this time to express the suppressed feelings of millions of overseas Chinese in a special environment.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Public Opinion</p>
<p>To express the suppressed feelings of millions of overseas Chinese. The Guomin Daily published a commentary titled "Even if Chu Has Only Three Households, It Will Surely Destroy Qin!" on the 6th as a message to the residents of Kowloon.</p>
<p>"In yesterday's newspapers, we saw the glorious news that Burma had declared its independence from British rule and officially become an independent nation. At the same time, we also saw the terrible news that 'Hong Kong armed police were mobilized on a large scale to supervise the demolition of wooden houses in Kowloon City.' In contrast, it really makes people feel like crying and laughing at the same time, feeling inexplicable!" This is the first paragraph of the Industrial and Commercial Daily's editorial on the 6th. The Sing Tao Daily, under the title "Victims of Diplomacy," made a general review of the incident and concluded: "Mr. Zhu Peitang and Mr. Liu Yi stood up to the front for the interests of national sovereignty and neighboring communities, risking danger and deserving admiration. We extend our respectful condolences and hope that the Hong Kong government will not treat them as ordinary offenders.</p>
<p>Friendly Relations Between China and Britain</p>
<p>Will eventually lead to harmony, and efforts should be made to reduce factors that damage feelings as much as possible. Look at things from a broader perspective, the friendship of the Chinese is worth cherishing after all." Its sincere advice to the Hong Kong government can truly be said to be earnest and well-meaning.</p>
<p>The "Condolences to the Residents of Kowloon City" editorial in the New Life Evening News expressed much dissatisfaction with our diplomatic authorities. The newspaper said: "They were originally compatriots of the motherland. From today onwards, they are overseas Chinese! At the time of ashes and ruins, they will naturally feel the mood of "The Last Lesson." We deeply understand this mood. We cannot blame others, but only blame our diplomats!... We appeal to the government to cherish the inward orientation of overseas Chinese! The primary condition for the inward orientation of overseas Chinese is that the country provides them with protection. This responsibility of protection, no matter how small, is extremely grateful in the eyes of overseas Chinese!"</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 6th, the residences of Kowloon City had been completely demolished. The former homes of every household were suddenly turned into a barren wasteland. Many displaced residents huddled among the rubble and broken tiles, with no shelter. The cold wind was piercing. Many women, who had just given birth, were pale and holding their infants, wandering around the hills, not knowing where to settle for the night. These are righteous people. How can the motherland ignore them? (Special correspondent Zi Jian)</p>
<h3>A Suspicious Case in the Old Capital: Judge Suspended for Abuse of Legal Loopholes</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, June 6th] On the second day of the implementation of the Constitution, a suspicious case of playing with the law to cause death occurred in Peiping. The perpetrators were too clever, and it seemed seamless. Unexpectedly, they were exposed by a clumsy law enforcer. The judge in charge has been suspended for investigation. The people of Peiping are paying close attention to the development of this suspicious case with great interest.</p>
<p>[As of today (the 6th), the case has progressed as follows: More than a month ago, the Criminal Police Team of Peiping arrested Ren Guorui, manager of Lihua Gold Shop, Wang Yunhua, Song Renhao, and two retired military policemen, Tian Tangchi and Tian Qingrong, on the accusation of "extortion and kidnapping" by Ning Wenxuan, the manager of Tongfasheng Silver Shop on Yangmeizhu Diagonal Street. The Criminal Police Team then transferred the group of suspects to the Peiping District Court. The judge in charge of the case, Lin Gan,</p>
<p>First Instance Final Judgment</p>
<p>Originally scheduled to pronounce the verdict at 12 noon on the 2nd of this month, the judge was nowhere to be seen at the appointed time. It was not until 5 p.m., when it was time to get off work, that Judge Lin, who was in charge of the case, came out. Instead, a clerk, Zhu Chenglin, hurriedly came out, acted as an agent in court, and announced Song Renhao's death sentence with a crumpled verdict. The other four were sentenced to life imprisonment. The news spread, and public opinion was in an uproar. Various newspapers pointed out that the case was highly questionable. According to the facts stated in the verdict, Song Renhao introduced his aunt, Liu Wang, to lend over 110 taels of gold to Lihua Gold Shop in the city. The general manager of the shop, Ren Guorui, the manager, Wang Yunhua, and the shop partner, Zhang Heming, then transferred the gold to Tongfachang Silver Shop and its manager, Chen Zemin. Because the shop went bankrupt in May of the 36th year of the Republic and manager Chen Zemin fled, the debt was pending shareholder liquidation. Song Renhao, Ren Guorui, Wang Yunhua, and Zhang Heming, who was at large, considering the loss of debt, conspired to kidnap the general manager of the shop, Ning Wenxuan, with the intention of extortion. On October 21st of the 36th year of the Republic, at around 9 p.m., Song Renhao and Ren Guorui first hired a car to invite Ning Wenxuan out. They also hired Tian Tangchi and Tian Qingrong to impersonate military police, holding a forged threatening letter, and ambushed Ning Wenxuan at the east entrance of Beibingmasi Hutong. They claimed that Ning Wenxuan was the manager of the Communist Party Border Region Bank and that they had come to handle the matter because someone had reported him. They threatened Ning Wenxuan, claiming that they were military police, etc. Then, Ning Renhao pretended to intercede and jointly kidnapped Ning Wenxuan to an empty room owned by Song Renhao at No. 6, Xin'an Lane, Xiang'er Hutong.</p>
<p>Extorting Ransom</p>
<p>100 million yuan. Because there was no cash, they forced him to sign a note under the name of Zhongyitang for a debt of 100 million yuan in national currency. Song Renhao then called Wang Zonghua and Zhang Heming to force them to sign a note for a debt of 280 taels of gold under the name of Song Renhao. Ren Guorui and Song Jishi took it to Ning's residence at No. 18, Beibingmasi the next day, asking for a shop guarantee to be added and promising to send Ning Wenxuan back, but refusing to tell Ning Wenxuan's location. On November 1st, Song Renhao, Ren Guorui, Wang Yunhua, and Zhang Heming transferred Ning Wenxuan to Song Renhao's residence at No. 7, Donghuangchenggen, Zhang's residence at No. 22, Huazhi Hutong, Waiyanshousi Street, and then back to Song's residence on the same afternoon. They forced him to sign a mortgage deed to guarantee the repayment of 280 taels of gold with his house at No. 18, Beibingmasi, before releasing Ning Wenxuan. The case was investigated and discovered by the Peiping Municipal Police Bureau. During the investigation, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit with the court."</p>
<p>However, according to the defendants' statements, the plaintiff deliberately created a trap, and they fell into it. It turned out that Ning had said, "The shareholders are unwilling to take out money easily. We should threaten me with a fake detention to give to the shareholders, and they will be willing to pay." Everything was a set-up, using legal loopholes.</p>
<p>Framing Someone</p>
<p>After Song Renhao was arrested, the police told him that Ning Wenxuan had accused him. Song said, "Fifth Master Ning, we have a teacher-student relationship. How could he accuse me?"</p>
<p>What society criticizes about this case is: 1. Song is a wealthy man and would not be a kidnapper, and besides, he is Ning's creditor. 2. Ning has an aunt, Ning Shuhua, who works as a clerk for Judge Lin Gan in the local court. Ning's lawyer Gao Xuemin also has a son, Bosheng, who is a candidate judge. 3. The sentence is too harsh.</p>
<p>Sure enough, public opinion had an effect. The Supervisory Group first sent Duan Muqie to the Higher Court on the 5th, ordering all suspects, Judge Lin Gan, and police clerks Ning Shuhua and Zhu Chenglin, to be suspended for thorough investigation.</p>
<p>This case is still developing and will be reported later. (Reporter Song Shaobo)</p>
<h3>Farmers Shot Dead by Bandits in Jiashan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiashan, June 10th] In Xiwang Village, which belongs to Dingshan Town (adjacent to Qingpu County, Jiangsu), a case of bandits shooting and killing farmers occurred late at night on the 9th.

Jiang is from Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province. He studied politics in Japan in his early years.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Changshu, June 10th] Township funding here will be distributed uniformly by the county from this month, prohibiting apportionment. All deputy township heads will be abolished.</p>
<h3>Officials in Hunan Provincial Government to be Punished for Oil Felt Purchase Scheme</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changsha, June 7th] The truth has been revealed in the case of Zhou Linzhi, director of the personnel office of the Hunan Provincial Government's Secretariat, purchasing over 300 rolls of oil felt from the Hunan Relief Branch. It is reported that in July of the 30th year of the Republic, the Hunan Relief Branch announced the sale of oil felt at a price of 140,000 yuan in national currency per roll. Each person was limited to purchasing 20 rolls and was required to submit a purchase application in advance. If the purchaser was an ordinary civilian, they needed proof from the local Baojia system. If they were civil servants, they needed proof from their service organization. At that time, Zhang Heling and 15 other staff members of the personnel office submitted individual applications based on their needs and sent them to the Hunan Relief Branch for purchase. After verification, they paid the money to the bank, received the receipt notification, and then went to the Relief Branch to issue a delivery notification before going to the storage and transportation station to pick up the goods. However, at that time, the Hunan Relief Branch, in order to simplify the procedures, issued a single total notification signed by Zhang Heling and others because Zhang Heling and others worked in the same organization. Therefore, only Zhang Heling stamped the receipt when picking up the goods and then distributed them to each person. Unexpectedly, the Hunan Relief Branch attached a copy of the distribution list of relief supplies to provincial, county, and municipal agencies with the Hai Dong telegram and sent it to the Provincial Government Accounting Office. It mistakenly listed the oil felt purchased privately by Zhang Heling and others as the amount distributed to the Secretariat. The remarks column included the words "Ten tents not issued." The Accounting Office compared it with the Hai Shan telegram and forwarded it to the Secretariat for investigation, causing misunderstandings among all parties that the materials distributed to the Secretariat had been obtained through a scheme by a few corrupt officials. Furthermore, because Zhang Heling was a staff member of the personnel office and Zhou Linzhi's fellow villager, it was mistakenly believed that Zhou Linzhi had stolen the purchase. At that time, Secretary-General Liu Gongwu was also unaware of the situation and was furious. The Provincial Government immediately sent personnel to the Relief Branch for thorough investigation, confirming that it was a private purchase at a price. The case was then clarified. However, Zhang Heling and others used the Secretariat's seal to certify their service organization without reporting to the Secretary-General in advance, which was highly inappropriate. Secretary-General Liu is currently investigating and will impose punishment.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Develops National Higher Education, Establishes Principles for Adjusting Universities and Colleges, and Develops National Secondary Education by Promulgating an Overall Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education believes that most of the country's colleges, universities, and research institutions are concentrated in coastal cities, making it difficult to improve the level of education and culture in the interior. In order to promote the balanced development of higher education throughout the country, it has decided to make adjustments and has formulated principles, which have been sent to various colleges, universities, research institutions, and provincial and municipal education bureaus for information. The principles of adjustment are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Principles for Adjusting Higher Education</p>
<p>The nation's human and material resources are extremely strained. All public and private colleges, universities, and research institutions should concentrate their efforts to enrich their content and improve their quality. Unless absolutely necessary, no new institutions should be established. Existing colleges, universities, and research institutions should be adjusted appropriately based on local population, economic conditions, transportation, and cultural conditions, paying attention to the establishment of educational and cultural centers in various parts of the country and considering balanced geographical development to achieve a rational distribution. Colleges and universities that were closed or merged during the War of Resistance should not be restored, except for those with a long history and outstanding achievements that are necessary to restore. The departments and faculties of public and private colleges and universities should be located in the same location and should not establish branch campuses. Colleges and universities that should be relocated should be relocated according to the locations stipulated by the Ministry of Education and should not change them on their own. A number of national educational and cultural centers are designated, and existing or relocated universities should be enriched as much as possible to become complete institutions of learning, and libraries, museums, and other independent schools and specialized schools should be allocated appropriately. The Ministry of Education will send personnel to conduct thorough inspections of provincial and private colleges and universities, and adjustment methods will be determined based on their teaching staff, facilities, and performance.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Ministry of Education's entire plan for the development of secondary education has been distributed to provincial and municipal education bureaus for implementation. The main points are outlined below:</p>
<p>Secondary Education Development Plan</p>
<p>(A) Middle School Section: Each province and city should immediately and effectively divide middle school districts. Each district should have at least one provincial complete middle school, and each county should have at least one county middle school. Counties should focus on running junior high schools in principle, but may also run senior high schools when necessary. Those that have already met the above standards should quickly seek to expand the number of schools. Provinces and cities should make full use of existing schools to expand the number of classes, and should prioritize filling the quota of existing classes. Provinces and cities should pay attention to the even distribution of middle schools in the region and should not concentrate them in a few cities. The establishment of private middle schools should be encouraged and management should be strengthened. To coordinate with the development of middle school education, the implementation of advanced normal education should be strengthened. The training institutions for existing middle school teachers should immediately increase their enrollment, and short-term teacher training classes should be established when necessary. By the end of the year, every 100 graduates from central schools should have 25 entering junior high school, and every 100 junior high school graduates should have 50 entering senior high school. For the development of girls' education, each province and city should moderately increase the number of classes. To coordinate with teacher training and economic conditions, 100,000 middle school classes should be added within five years. With 40 students per class, a total of 4 million middle school students will be trained. The funding for provinces and cities to add schools and classes will be included in the budgets of the provinces and cities by the central government in installments, and the funding for counties and cities will be included in the budgets of the counties and cities by the provinces in installments. (B) Normal School Section: Normal school districts in provinces and cities that are too large or too small and inconvenient to implement should be adjusted. Each province and city that has not set up two normal schools in each normal school district should set them up completely. Each school should have at least nine classes, and each class should enroll 50 students. Each province and city must set up a simplified normal school in each county and city, except for particularly remote and impoverished areas. Each school should have at least six classes, and each class should enroll 50 students. The procedure for increasing classes and establishing schools in normal schools throughout the country is that, in order to coordinate with teacher training and economic conditions, it is planned to add approximately 10,000 normal school classes within five years. With 50 students per class, approximately 500,000 students will be trained in normal education. Provinces and cities should formulate plans for establishing schools and increasing classes in normal schools and submit them to the Ministry for approval. The expenses for provinces and cities to establish normal schools and increase classes will be included in the budgets of the provinces and cities by the central government in installments for provincial and municipal schools, and in the budgets of the counties and cities by the provinces in installments for county and municipal schools. (C) Vocational School Section: Vocational school districts that have not been divided in each province and city should be quickly delineated. Those that were temporarily divided in the past due to the impact of the war should be adjusted quickly if necessary. In addition to setting up vocational education subjects in each province and city in accordance with the needs indicated in "China's Destiny", various vocational classes related to life supplementary education (such as sewing, hairdressing, carpentry, etc.) should also be set up, reaching a minimum of training 10% of the number of people who have received national education. Provinces and cities without vocational school districts should establish junior and senior vocational schools with various subjects that meet the needs of the industry according to the production situation in each district. Provinces and cities should urge counties and cities to set up junior practical vocational schools and encourage larger public and private factories, farms, and commercial trade associations to establish vocational school classes. The procedure for establishing schools and increasing classes in vocational schools nationwide is that, in order to coordinate with teacher training and economic conditions, it is planned to add 10,000 vocational school classes within five years. With 50 students per class, approximately 500,000 students will be trained in vocational education.</p>
<h3>The Script of "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" Wins a Cultural Award</h3>
<p>[Nanjing News from Dajiang Press] Since the Central Cultural Movement Committee began awarding excellent original scripts, many have responded enthusiastically. On the 10th, the committee announced that Shi Qihan's "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" had won the award.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaowu Cables the Ministry of Education Again, Requesting That Shandong Normal Specialized School Be Changed to a College</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Jinan, 11th Telegram] The movement to restore Shandong Provincial Normal Specialized School to a college has recently been launched again. A few days ago, Chairman Wang Yaowu stated that the school had repeatedly requested to be changed to a college, but had not been approved. However, considering that Shandong Province is currently in a period of pacification and that transportation is inconvenient, it is extremely important to cultivate teachers for inner schools. He specifically cabled Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, approving the change to Shandong Provincial Normal College starting from the next semester. At the same time, the students of the school also took advantage of the visit of Committee Member Sui of the Ministry of Education to Jinan for inspection and the convening of the Provincial Provisional Assembly. They held a meeting on the 8th and decided to petition all relevant parties again, not giving up until the goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>Cheng Hua Chairman of the Board, Liu Wenhui, Takes Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Ya'an, 11th Telegram] Liu Wenhui has taken office as Chairman of the Board of Chengdu Chenghua University. Mr. Liu has donated 1.1 billion yuan to enrich the school's fund.</p>
<h3>Student Statistics in Peiping: More Than 153,000 Students in the City</h3>

<h3>China Journalism College Commemorates Zhang Ji, Mr. Pan Gongzhan Expresses Infinite Emotion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] China Journalism College held a memorial service for the late Chairman of the Board, Zhang Ji, yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Shaoxing Road in this city. Those from all walks of life who attended to pay their respects included Chairman Fang Xikong, Director Wu Kaixian, Xu Jiyu, Xi Yushu, Chen Baohua, Lin Sushan, Wang Yachen, etc. The service was presided over by Vice Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the school's board of directors. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After a three-minute moment of silence, the National Government's commendation order was read. Mr. Pan Gongzhan said in his speech: Today is the memorial service for Chairman Zhang Puquan. Looking back to the two years since the school was founded, Chairman Zhang devoted his utmost effort to the school, assisting Principal Chen in administering the school. We are here today to commemorate him, and our emotions are many. The words that Chairman Zhang spoke to the students when he came to the school a year ago are still vividly clear in our ears. The scene is like yesterday. His spirit will live forever and will be engraved in our hearts. When good people heard the news of his death, they held a memorial service before the memorial services held by various circles in Shanghai. The meaning of this is not only a private relationship between colleagues, teachers and students, but also a greater relationship, that is, his life's contribution to the party and the country and the spirit of leadership, which we will never forget and admire. Now that he has suddenly passed away, the blows and losses to the country and to us will be self-evident. His life's work can be summarized by two sentences in the National Government's commendation order: "Steadfast but not stubborn, harmonious but not compromising", worthy of being a "model teacher", worthy of our promotion and emulation. Mr. Pan continued: Today, in commemorating Mr. Puquan, we must achieve two goals: Continue the spirit of Chairman Zhang's leadership and Principal Chen's administration of the school, carry it forward, and lay the foundation for a revolutionary journalist academy. Recognize that his life was dedicated to fighting for the country, and we should follow in his footsteps, be loyal to the party and the country, and fulfill the responsibilities of journalists. Before his death, he once said to Director Lin: "China Journalism College should work hard to run well". Unfortunately, these words were his last words. In the future, we must follow this instruction, support the school, cultivate young people, and comfort his spirit in heaven. After Mr. Pan's speech, representatives of guests Fang Zhi, Principal, faculty, alumni, and students spoke in succession. Finally, Ms. Zhang Lin, daughter of Mr. Zhang, gave a reply. The ceremony ended at about 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>Referee was Chen Jixiang, linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Zhang Le. The Blue team kicked off, but their five forwards were blocked. After back and forth play, the White team seemed to have the upper hand with frequent attacks. Tie Funing once headed the ball to save it, almost resulting in a comical own goal. After a stalemate until the 25th minute, Han Longhai of the White team committed a foul on Fei Chunhua on the right wing. Fei dribbled a few steps, then kicked the ball, which flew like an arrow into the net. The White team opened the score. The Blue team launched a full-scale counterattack to no avail. Ten minutes later, Zuo Zhuang hooked the ball in, Hua Yi picked it up, and A Sun kicked it in the air from the left, sending the ball straight to the right corner, a beautiful and clear shot. The White team took a 2-0 lead. A few minutes later, Xiao Fei penetrated again, passed the ball to the center, and Xia Tixian was waiting, scoring another goal, making it 3-0. At this time, Chen Jiawan of the Blue team's foot injury worsened, and he announced his retirement. Zhuang Youren replaced him. Soon after, the first half ended, with the White team leading by three goals.</p>
<p>Lineup Adjustment, Average Strength</p>
<p>After the break, the two teams regrouped, and the rain intensified. Both sides played in the rain. Han Longhai of the White team announced a short break due to his original foot injury. Grinas of the Blue team was transferred to replace him, and Robert Stoff arrived in time to take over the central forward position for the Blue team. With these changes, the strength of the two teams became more balanced, and the Blue team's offensive also increased. After a fierce attack, the Blue team turned the tide. Lu Qingxiang received the ball and passed it to the right, and Mingzhe's nephew Gou followed up in the center. Xiao Huangmao used his skills to break the White team's goal for the first time, making it 1-3. This was followed by a stalemate until the 37th minute, when Grinas fired a cold arrow from 30 yards away, breaking the net. When time ran out, the White team won 4-1.</p>

<h3>Song Yixin Departs for Japan Today to Negotiate the Export of Taiwan Sugar; Will Discuss Payment Issues with the Allied Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Song Yixin, Associate Manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, has scheduled to fly to Japan via Northwest Airlines at 9:00 AM this morning to negotiate the export of Taiwan sugar to Japan. He is expected to return to Shanghai in two weeks. He told reporters before his departure: The export plan for Taiwan sugar this year is tentatively set at 100,000 tons, of which 50,000 tons will be exported to Japan. The selling price of exported Taiwan sugar will be determined by referring to the world sugar market price to compete with foreign sugar. In the past few months, the world sugar price has been around US$200 per ton. Recently, the market price has weakened to about US$150 per ton. The export price of Taiwan sugar to Japan cannot exceed this standard to gain a foothold in the Japanese market. During this trip, he will negotiate with the Allied Headquarters on the procedures for paying for the sugar. Once the negotiations are finalized, the first batch of sugar for export to Japan, amounting to 25,000 tons, can be shipped from the beginning of February.</p>

<h3>South China Import Management Branch Suggests Strengthening Imports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou, 9th Telegram] After the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, imports from Hong Kong to South China have not been relaxed. It is learned that the South China Import Management Branch has formulated six major suggestions to strengthen imports based on the current situation and submitted them to the General Association for implementation. The main points are: (A) Restore the temporary implementation measures of last year, allowing each business to import five times a month, so that accumulated goods in Hong Kong can be easily imported. (B) Relax the import quota for self-provided foreign exchange. The environment in South China is special, and this method may be suitable for current needs. It is also reported that the branch has decided to relax the qualifications for examining importers. It has also decided to set up an appeal committee to accept special requests from merchants and people regarding import and export.</p>
<p>Regarding the liquidation of the Guangdong Industrial Company, the Guangdong Provincial Council had previously resolved to conduct the liquidation directly. However, the Provincial Government recently stated that the Provincial Council has no right to liquidate provincial state-owned industrial organizations, and can only send representatives to participate in the Provincial Government's liquidation organization. After hearing the news, the Provincial Council expressed great indignation and has decided to jointly conduct the liquidation of the company's accounts with the Supervisory Office, the Court, the Audit Office, and other institutions.</p>
<h3>Saying "Auditing New Brokers" is Inaccurate, Says Securities Exchange Authority; Rumors of New Stocks Being Listed are Also Unfounded</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It has recently been rumored that the Shanghai Securities Exchange will approve a batch of new brokers, granting them licenses to operate. It is also rumored that several new stocks have also been reviewed and approved and will be listed one after another. When reporters inquired with the responsible parties of the Securities Exchange yesterday, they were informed that both rumors were completely unfounded. Since its opening, the Securities Exchange has only approved one batch of brokers when it first opened, and has never handled broker audits since then. Even if there is a need to add brokers due to business needs, it should be formally announced publicly to openly accept external applications. However, the Securities Exchange currently feels that there is no need to add brokers. As for those who have applied to list new stocks, although some manufacturers have filled out forms and provided documents to apply for listing, the Securities Review Committee has not been convened recently, and no new stocks have been approved for listing.</p>
<h3>Newsprint Slightly Decreases</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of paper on the market, those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them easily, and buyers cannot purchase goods. As a result, prices have continued to rise in recent days. For example, the highest price of newsprint on the market on Thursday was 2.2 million yuan per ream, 1.9 million yuan for open-faced paper, and other papers also reached new records. It was not until the near weekend that prices gradually fell. Newsprint fell by 300,000 yuan to 1.9 million yuan, and open-faced paper fell to 1.7 million yuan. Compared with the end of the year, the prices of various papers have increased by 30 to 40%.</p>
<h3>Total Export Volume of Taiwan Tea Last Year Was Approximately 10 Million Taiwan Jin</h3>
<p>Through the continuous efforts of the government and tea merchants over the past two years, the export of Taiwan tea has recovered to more than 46% of its peak. According to statistics from the Taiwan Tea Association, the total export volume of Taiwan tea last year was 9,775,450 Taiwan jin, including 4,246,842 Taiwan jin of Pouchong tea, 1,261,270 Taiwan jin of Oolong tea, 3,745,405 Taiwan jin of black tea, and 521,941 Taiwan jin of other tea, an increase of 3,627,738 Taiwan jin compared to the total export volume of 6,147,720 Taiwan jin in the 35th year of the Republic of China. The peak period was in the 28th year of the Republic of China, at 21,099,743 Taiwan jin.</p>
<h3>Imported Cigarettes: Resuming Stamping for Tax Payment</h3>
<p>Regarding foreign-made cigarettes, the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, had been handling the matter of resuming the practice of affixing verification stamps to each package for tax payment. In December of last year, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Cigarette Guild, and representatives of cigarette merchants, citing the excessive burden of stamp affixing and tax supplementation, requested that all existing stocks of cigarettes held by merchants, for each foreign cigarette brand with a quantity of fewer than five thousand cigarettes, be exempted from tax and stamp affixing. The bureau forwarded this request to the Ministry of Finance for approval, but it was not approved. Therefore, strict enforcement will be carried out in the near future. To prevent merchants from breaking up large quantities into smaller ones to evade taxation, assistance has been requested from relevant authorities in the city. Subsequently, if any foreign cigarettes are found without verification stamps, regardless of the quantity, they will be confiscated and forfeited to the government, and the case will be transferred to the court for penalty.</p>
<p>Slight Decrease in Cigarette Prices</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the cigarette market initially saw a decline due to selling pressure from bullish speculators. However, it rebounded because of the support from merchants' hedging activities. Recently, a significant amount of Yizhong and British Old Knife brand cigarettes were resold by counterparts in other cities. As a result, the market price recovered slightly, rising by 300,000 to 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Great Kress cigarettes saw a shipment release, causing a drop of 4,000 yuan, while other brands experienced minor declines.</p>
<p>Soap Price Drops</p>
<p>The price of daily-use soap has fallen due to a large holder facing tight funds and selling off a significant amount of spot goods. As a result, besides the leveling of Guben soap, Xiangmao soap fell by 230,000 yuan, and other brands also saw minor declines of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. However, the market for matches, candles, and kerosene remained stable.</p>

<h3>Aurora</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The world is a place that generates or contains mystery, where there are many things that are elusive or unpredictable. Among them also grow a kind of people who call themselves wise, but to this day cannot answer the question of their own origin. Or they may push it onto the Creator, but the Creator itself becomes a problem, so they can only entrust it to mystery.</p>
<p>The aurora is a mysterious thing, but looking at its folded posture and fantastic colors, it can truly be described as myriad purples and reds, and all kinds of enchanting beauty. Like a curtain on the sky, graceful and charming, like the beautiful streamers of sunset glow, or like a ribbon around the space.</p>
<p>Sweden, Norway, Canada, and Alaska often have the spectacle of the Northern Lights, and the frequency of their occurrence is not as low as imagined. Ordinary people think that the discovery of the aurora must be at the North and South Poles. In fact, this is not the case, because we know that the Earth's magnetic field fluctuates. This magnetic variation can be measured with an ordinary compass. If it aligns with a certain place, then that place is the magnetic pole. The cause of this magnetic change comes from sunspots. But the aurora is caused by the Earth's magnetic field, so the aurora can shift with the southern magnetic field.</p>
<p>The aurora not only expresses its beauty in color, but also in its unique shape. The most common shape is roughly like a spiral, sometimes without color, only radiating light, sparkling and dazzling. Sometimes, all kinds of colors intertwine, it is dazzling. Most of the positions are fixed, but a small part quickly jumps up and down, left and right, like a spring under force, and emits a needle-like light, of varying lengths, adhering to the upper edge of the main band, with varying degrees of darkness and height. There is also a fan-shaped shape, and a crown-like shape, but they are not usually seen. This form of aurora may be more moving than the former, but unfortunately, the occurrence of this type of aurora is often in very high altitudes, about six hundred miles or more, and ordinary people's eyes may not be able to see it clearly.</p>
<p>In the past, people generally believed that the aurora was an unpredictable and extremely mysterious phenomenon, just like seeing a solar eclipse. According to scientists who are currently engaged in the study of the aurora, they have obtained two theories through observation and exploration: one is that the light emitted by the sun has an extremely short wavelength, which is a kind of radiant energy, such as ultraviolet rays. The atmosphere at high altitudes is relatively thin and easily collides with this short-wave radiation, ionizing itself, that is, bearing an electrical charge. These large particles, composed of various gas molecules, are charged by the energy of short-wave radiation. Let us assume that a hydrogen atom is composed of a nucleus, that is, a proton, and an electron around it. Let it pass through a vacuum tube with high voltage, so that the gas discharges in the tube and generates light. Now let us imagine that the electrons outside the nucleus can leap through many energy planes in a certain way. From the nucleus, these energy planes are divided into several levels, marked as one, two, three, four, five, etc. When hydrogen atoms are normally at rest, electrons are on the first plane. But when energy is added to the atom, hydrogen discharges in the vacuum tube, and the electron on the first plane leaps into the outer, higher energy plane, or even completely leaps out of the atom. Hydrogen then becomes a hydrogen ion, that is, it is ionized. If the applied energy is immediately removed at this time, the electron will return to the inner layer from the higher energy plane. In this way, when the electron jumps from a higher energy plane to a lower energy plane, the added energy is released and transformed into light. The greater the drop in the energy layer, the shorter the duration of light emission, which is the cause of ultraviolet rays. Now that we understand the generation of light, it is not difficult to understand the principle of gas ionization and the generation of aurora.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the sun directly emits high-energy charged particles at a very high speed, roughly one thousand miles per second. These high-speed particles may be deflected by a weak magnetic field, so these particles form the aurora far away from the earth, and then go down along the magnetic lines of force. The closer they get to the ground, the stronger the magnetic force they are subjected to, so the degree of deflection is also greater, so the aurora is formed into a spiral shape with a large base and a small pointed top. The lowest aurora is forty-five miles high, and the highest is six hundred miles high. The aurora can also affect radio communication, because the ionization of the gas can have the same properties as a conductor, and it can also make photographic dry plates sensitive, so its height and distance can be measured.</p>

<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>The difficulties in separating plutonium from uranium isotopes, such as the lack of differences in various properties and the extreme similarity in weight, have also been solved. Because it is another element, it has different chemical and physical properties from uranium, so it is possible to obtain it by a relatively simple method.</p>
<p>But at that time, the plutonium produced by the cyclotron was too little. Several weeks of work yielded only a few micrograms of plutonium. You know, one gram is one twenty-eighth of an ounce, and one microgram is one millionth of a gram, which is equivalent to about one three hundred and fifty millionth of an ounce. The air capacity in a human lung is 250,000 micrograms, which is almost 100,000 times more than the plutonium sample at that time. We can often imagine how little it was.</p>
<p>However, scientists will not be discouraged. In the autumn of 1942, Cunnigham and Weruer weighed the first pure plutonium. At the end of the year, they obtained 500 micrograms of pure plutonium. This was not enough to cover the head of a nail, but it was extremely important for the study of plutonium. With these small gains, the large research work could begin, and the establishment of the Plutonium-Seperationplant in Clinton Teun, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Because there are methods for studying the smallest substances in modern science. That is Tracer Chemiotry. They use Geiger counters to indirectly measure radioactivity from a solution in which trace amounts of plutonium and compounds of other elements coexist, and deduce its properties. Precise pulse analyzers are used to detect the velocity of radioactive particles to distinguish various radioactive particles. Various precise instruments, balances, and containers are used to record its weight and perform various experiments. Therefore, trace amounts of substances can still be used for various tests.</p>
<p>Scientists further reformed tracer chemistry and established a more precise method, which is Ultra-Microchemistry. They reduced the precision of all the techniques and methods of Micro-Chemistry again. The weight is weighed with a Micro-balance. Heating and precipitation are carried out in Micro-electrodes, micro-crucibles and micro-tubes. The most sensitive balance in the University of California laboratory can weigh one microgram of substance with an error of less than one percent.</p>
<p>As a result, mankind fully understood the chemical process of separating uranium and plutonium and obtained pure plutonium. It also became familiar with all its properties.</p>
<p>Further expansion enabled the first plutonium-producing Pile to work in Hanlordi Washington, separated it, and made the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Professor Smyth of the Clinton plant had a detailed report. From there, we can know that in the atomic pile, plutonium is a pure uranium rod, passing through many basements made of mixed concrete. That is called the "Cauyon". Each part has the necessary dissolving pool, settling pool, and agitator (Centrifuges). Repeated changes, melting, and sedimentation occur, and plutonium is separated in the end.</p>
<p>Scientists in 1944 had completed the manufacture of plutonium on a scale ten billion times larger than what they had obtained in their experiments. And it reached the point where the loss was less than 20 percent. In the summer of 1945, the Hanford plutonium production plant reached a fairly perfect state, capable of producing enough plutonium to be used as the raw material for atomic bombs.</p>
<p>However, the road ahead is still full of difficulties if scientists hope that plutonium can truly benefit mankind. It is unknown how much effort it will take to achieve the goal of two pounds per day.</p>
<p>Professor Smyth's plan is to hope to obtain a production of two pounds per day, so as to obtain 500,000 to 15 million watts of electrical energy. This huge power.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, if each kilowatt of electricity is calculated at three US cents, then 22 million US dollars of coal can be saved every month to obtain electricity.</p>
<p>From the point of view of power plants, the abundance of power supply is even more sufficient than the power generated by the water power that can be used by the Grand Coulec water gate, which is the largest in the world. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Automatic Switch</h3>
<p>— Hong En</p>
<p>All kinds of automatic switches, such as radios, electric stoves, and electric lights, can be made to turn on and off automatically at a certain time. Its outer surface looks like an old clock. As long as one side is connected to the object and one end is plugged into the socket on the wall, it will automatically turn on or off at the time you set without any mistake.</p>
<p>The sound of the bedside radio often likes to lull listeners into sweet dreams. If there is an automatic switch, it can be turned off for you in the middle of the night, and the radio will be powered on again at 7 o'clock the next day to wake you up. Also, the electric fan will serve you until you fall asleep on hot nights.</p>

<h3>Supplement to the Sinicization of Number Segmentation</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zicai</p>
<p>Read December 22, 1947. The article "Sinicization of Number Segmentation" written by Mr. Zhou Shimin in the 21st issue of this journal, which refers to "Numerotion" in mathematics, urgently needs to be improved. I agree very much and have long had a record of it, recorded in a private book, but I have been hesitant to publish it. Now, according to the old records, I will supplement it for Mr. Zhou. The "Tong Li" written by Mr. Yu Quyuan of Deqing in the late Qing Dynasty is to straighten out the "Gujin Yunhui" written by Li Renqing of the Yuan Dynasty. Li was very studied in arithmetic and cited many national languages and Wei Zhao's notes. Quyuan said that what Li said was the ancient number, which is different from the current number. The current number refers to the numeration method used at that time in the Qing Dynasty. The numeration method of our Republic of China seems to be connected to the old one of the Qing Dynasty, and the calculation of Arabic numeral formulas mostly follows the Western method, with a comma (,) added every three digits. However, the arrangement of the numeration method of our country's current number is actually one level for every four digits. However, the government believes that the current number is three digits, while the old numeration is four digits, which is inconsistent. Having been aware of this for a long time, the Ministry of Education issued a circular in June 1931, before the terms of the number of records were determined. For the time being, the words "yi" (億) and "zhao" (兆), which have ambiguities in arithmetic, will be cancelled. The numbers above "wan" (萬) are crowned with numbers above the word "wan", such as ten wan (十萬), hundred wan (百萬), thousand wan (千萬), wan wan (萬萬), ten wan wan (十萬萬), hundred wan wan (百萬萬), etc. Quyuan said there were two tables, one for ancient numbers and one for current numbers. The ancient numbers take ten "wan" (萬) as "yi" (億), and ten "yi" (億) as "zhao" (兆), which was not applicable at that time, so I will not repeat it now. Now I will record the current number table as follows:</p>
<p>One Ten ones are ten Ten tens are hundred Ten hundreds are thousand</p>
<p>Ten thousands are ten thousands Ten ten thousands are hundred thousands Ten hundred thousands are million Ten million thousands are ten million</p>
<p>Ten thousand ten thousands are hundred million Ten ten million are billion Ten hundred million are ten billion Ten thousand billion are hundred billion</p>
<p>Ten thousand billion are trillion Ten ten trillion are hundred trillion Ten hundred trillion are ten trillion Ten thousand trillion are hundred trillion</p>
<p>Ten thousand trillion are jing Ten ten jing are hundred jing Ten hundred jing are ten jing Ten thousand jing are hai</p>
<p>Ten thousand hai are hai Ten ten hai are hundred hai Ten hundred hai are ten hai</p>
<p>Since the government issued a circular long ago, this table seems to be no longer applicable today. In recent days, it has become increasingly larger. I have seen people using "yi" (億) to write checks, and I immediately informed them of the government's order, recognizing that the use of the word "yi" (億) is illegal. Later I asked those who specialize in accounting, who said that the word "yi" (億) can be used, there was a circular, but I was negligent and did not see it. The Western name takes million as Million and ten thousand ten thousand as Billion. Now, as Mr. Zhou mentioned, the number 6.39 billion is written in three digits as follows:</p>
<p>Ten Billion Billion Ten Million Million Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Thousand Hundred Ten One</p>
<p>6,390,000,000.</p>
<p>If it is written in four digits, it is as follows:</p>
<p>Ten Billion Billion Ten Million Million Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Thousand Hundred Ten One</p>
<p>63,9000,0000.</p>
<p>Bill Mill</p>
<p>ion ion</p>
<p>From this point of view, Mr. Zhou's three points, can avoid irregular memory; improvement will help popularize science; we cannot always follow people's ideas and should strive for self-improvement, these two points are very meaningful, and I agree very much, so I specially supplement them.</p>
<p>Also, the names of the arithmetic numbers in our country, according to the records in various books, are all based on the "Shushu Jiyi" written by Xu Yue. Its names are "yi (一), shi (十), bai (百), qian (千), wan (萬), yi (億), zhao (兆), jing (京), gai (垓), zi (秭), shu (杼), gou (溝), jian (澗), zheng (正), zai (載)", etc. From the word "yi (億)" to the word "zai (載)" is ten digits, and above that there are names such as "Ganges sand" and "immeasurable number".</p>
<p>Quyuan's table takes "jing (京)" as "jing (經)", and "hai (核)" as "hai (咳)", also written as "gai (姟)". Although his description is all based on historical data, it is not as popular as the names recorded by Xu Yue. I think the government should issue an order on the number of lives in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Quyuan divides ancient numbers and current numbers into two types, or it is said that the numeration method is divided into three levels, one is Quyuan's ancient number, one is Quyuan's current number, and the other is to take ten thousand ten thousand as "yi (億)", and ten thousand yi as "zhao (兆)", which is not applicable today, so it will not be described in detail, but scholars must know it.</p>
<h3>How Old is the Earth?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changqing</p>
<p>How old is the earth? There have been many speculations about this problematic question before. Experts who study paleontology say: Humans have existed for 50,000 years. If the age of the ape-man is also included, it is fully hundreds of thousands of years, so the age of the earth is about millions of years.</p>
<p>Geologists have studied various rocks, deposits, and volcanic results, and feel that the oldest rocks on Earth are 200 million years old.</p>
<p>Some people have also used the amount of invertebrate bone ash accumulated in the sea to prove that there was life in the sea tens of millions of years ago. But before there was life, how many years did the earth exist for, no one knows, and there is no accurate calculation.</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of everyone's research on atomic bombs, everyone is paying attention to rare metals such as uranium and steel, which are the raw materials for atomic bombs. It has been found that every two taels of uranium will only have half a tael left after 4.5 billion years. The remaining half tael becomes lead. This lead is somewhat different from ordinary lead and can be identified. Now, by calculating the composition of this lead from the uranium ore and comparing the composition of the uranium, a year can be calculated.</p>
<p>But strangely, although the age of uranium ore varies, the calculated answer is always 1.99 billion years. This method of calculating the age of the Earth is certainly much more accurate.</p>
<h3>New Research on the Sense of Smell</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Of our several primary senses, the sense of smell is the last to be understood. For years, scientists have racked their brains to dissect and experiment, hoping to find the source of the nose's sense of smell, but all have failed. On the contrary, this mysterious thing has made spice merchants a great deal of money. At the end of November 1947, Dr. Lloyd H. Beck and Dr. Walter R. Miles of Yale University in the United States, after years of research and experimentation, now published a very novel theory about the sense of smell of the nose. The average person and past physiologists always believed that the nose is a chemical laboratory that uses chemical analysis methods to identify odors, but this is completely wrong. The nose is originally an instrument specifically used to measure the infrared rays absorbed by odorous gases.</p>
<p>Scientists have long known that odorous gases can absorb infrared rays of a certain wavelength. In industry, this phenomenon has been used to identify gases; and chemists often radiate infrared rays into odorous gases to observe some physical reactions of these gases after absorbing infrared rays. This led Dr. Beck and Dr. Miles to believe that the sense of smell must be related to infrared rays. After years of experimentation, they finally proved that their ideal was correct.</p>
<p>They have collected a lot of experimental data, and researched that infrared wavelengths between 7.5 one ten-thousandth of a centimeter and 14 one ten-thousandth of a centimeter will be absorbed by odorous gases, while odorless gases have no reaction. And it so happens that most of the wavelengths of the heat waves radiated by the human body at normal temperature are within this range. So how does the sense of smell happen? In the nostrils, there is an "odor receptor" that lies across the airflow channel, containing special cells. The temperature of the tissue around the cells is relatively low, so these hot cells radiate heat waves to the surrounding tissue, like a small radio station sending out radio waves. When pure air flows through this channel, the cells have no reaction, and the rate of radiating heat does not change. Assuming that odorous gas flows through the channel, it immediately absorbs a part of the heat waves emitted by the cells, and the rate of radiation must increase, thus stimulating the cells to produce a special reaction, which is the sense of smell.</p>
<p>In order to confirm this theory, Dr. Beck and Dr. Miles first used cockroaches for experiments, because the sense of smell of cockroaches is controlled by antennae exposed outside the body. They released the vapor of clove oil, which is most able to attract cockroaches, outside a tightly sealed window, and it would smell this odor inside the window, trying to rush out of the window; the reason is that the infrared rays radiated from its antennae can pass through this window. If the window is replaced with a glass plate that infrared rays cannot pass through, it will not smell anything and will have no impulse. The same result was obtained by using honey to attract bees. Their antennae are exposed outside, and they can radiate heat waves to distant places, making the sense of smell reach a very far distance.</p>
<p>The structure of the human nose is complex, and it cannot be tested now. The entire olfactory instrument is deeply buried inside the nose, and there is no way to artificially absorb the infrared rays radiated by the cells. Dr. Beck and Dr. Miles claim that as long as they can get an infrared spectrophotometer, they can test it.</p>
<p>This revolutionary new theory obviously needs deeper research and more experiments by scientists to determine its value. If it is indeed the case, then a new science will be created in science—smelling spectroscopy. In the future, scientists can combine two gases with different odors to produce heat waves that can absorb another certain wavelength, that is, produce a third new odor, so that our noses can get more happiness. About these researches and experiments, two or three years ago, rumors spread to the ears of those fox-like spice merchants. Currently, they are trying to obtain the complete report of this research in order to manufacture the world's newest and most seductive spices for both men and women.</p>
<h3>Radioactive Isotopes: The Production of the Latest Atomic Drugs</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>Besides the awe and terror that atomic energy, which has shocked the world, has given us in the form of the atomic bomb, it has also given us unlimited energy and hopeful new drugs. Researchers have definitively proved that thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism can be treated with radioactive iodine. Leukemia and polycythemia can be treated with radioactive phosphorus. The United States has recently begun to share its atomic knowledge with the world. President Truman declared that radioactive isotopes can be supplied to foreign scientists to jointly combat diseases and improve human welfare. Not long ago, a special plane carried phosphorus-32 to the National X-ray and Radium Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia for application.</p>
<p>Isotopes are atoms of the same element but with different weights. We know that in a typical atom, an electron cloud orbits around a nucleus. In the nucleus, there are two kinds of molecules, one with a positive charge, called a proton, and the other with no charge, called a neutron. When an atom is bombarded with neutrons, if the neutron is absorbed by the nucleus, an isotope is formed. The chemical and biological properties of this element remain unchanged, but its weight has changed.</p>
<p>Some isotopes are unstable. Their nuclei break apart and release radiation similar to light, thus producing radioactivity. For example, the nucleus of uranium-235 (the starting point of the atomic bomb) has ninety-two protons and one hundred and forty-two neutrons, and is explosive.</p>
<p>The radioactive isotopes of certain elements are like microscopic mirrors. As soon as they enter the body, they emit a kind of energy that can be recorded, so we can clearly see its process and changes in the human body. For example, how does a sugar containing isotopes travel in the digestive system after being eaten? How does it change? How does it become working ability? All can be traced and indicated.</p>
<p>Experts say that the widespread use of radioactive elements may help explain how the human body becomes old, thus clarifying many unconquered diseases. Some isotopes remain in certain tissues and emit short-range radiation to eliminate cancer and malignant tumors, eliminating the need for surgery.</p>
<p>So far, ninety-six kinds of isotopes have been produced. Their uses are waiting for scientists to study and utilize. These atoms will surely give people happiness and health.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Selling Cruelty</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Someone talked about winter relief and donating cotton clothes today, which made me quite emotional. It happened that I went out today. On a street where I live, which is nominally a big city but is actually as dirty as a pigsty or dog kennel, besides the people who can be encountered everywhere who are "washing endlessly" under the wall with "faucets inside, urinating prohibited," there are also vegetable stalls that are packed and impassable. Walking through this mud-like crowd, there was a beggar in his forties, pulling a cart with small wheels, on which lay a middle-aged man resembling a zombie, with his legs gone, only a piece of flesh sticking out. Another younger person was shouting with a hoarse voice, asking others to give them sympathy. Even if I still have a bit of compassion, I don't know why, but when I saw such a ferocious performance, I had to glance away and didn't dare to extend the "hand of pity."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, walking further past, on one side of the vegetable stall, there was an even more bizarre sight. A female beggar of about fifty years old was reaching out for money, while a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl, yellow-faced and emaciated, was kneeling close to her, holding a wooden bowl, chewing a mouthful of rice bran. The bowl was also full of it. There seemed to be tear stains in the girl's eyes. On the side of the bowl, "philanthropists" had already put down more than a dozen thousand-yuan bills, and it seemed that the results were already good.</p>
<p>My heart moved. Leaving aside the matter of whether the girl was well-fed and warm, it is probably not easy for a mother to let her daughter perform by swallowing chaff, using this to collect money. The wise King Solomon used killing the baby to determine the authenticity of the mother. A true mother would of course cry bitterly. The greatness of motherhood lies in this, and the pitiful motherhood is also worth our help. If she sacrifices her own daughter with tears (possibly because she was beaten for not wanting to) to perform this trick, this mother probably has a big problem in her identity. Whether those banknotes can bring warmth to the daughter is especially uncertain.</p>
<p>Chinese people are perhaps the most fond of appreciating cruelty, so killings must be carried out in the marketplace to show the public, and the great bandit is not afraid of death, also boasting of "being a good man again in twenty years." When "executing prisoners," the pits and valleys are full, taking it as a rare and lively event, and newspaper reporters must take a photo as material. These are all ironclad facts. Other countries have been secretly executing death sentences for fifty years, as if we turn a blind eye, it's all the same. The two can't be confused. Although Sima Qian's articles are good, such as the "Biographies of Assassins," with such records as "Grateful for your kindness and allow you to carry out the order, throwing Mount Tai is as light as a feather," treating beheading and suicide as commonplace, it's really not a good thing. The Japanese are proud of seppuku, such as the Forty-seven Ronin of Ako, etc., but bravery and cruelty eventually led to the tragic self-immolation. I think the "two-sword style" Bushido is nothing great, although there is a perverse spirit of loyalty. A nation cannot establish a broad and lofty foundation on magnanimity, tolerance, peace, and rectitude. There is always a feeling of "a gust of wind does not last the whole morning, a torrential rain does not last the whole day." At least, I feel this way. Maybe my nerves are too weak.</p>
<p>Some beggars in the north specialize in eating sulfur in winter. When spring comes, they develop sores all over their bodies and lie on the streets to earn the assistance of philanthropists. In fact, they use the money to buy white liquor and smoked pork. If they have more, they go to gambling houses. This is one thing. There are also street performers who sell solutions. At the last performance, there must be a performance of killing a son with a knife and dismembering him into eight pieces. If the audience doesn't see this, they always feel that it's not enjoyable. This is another thing. The purpose and method of both are the same: using people's curiosity to arouse abnormal sympathy to achieve the plan of deceiving money. For those who are crying from hunger and cold, we should "share sparingly," and treat the hunger of others as our own, not just sympathy and relief, but directly regard it as our own pain. Zhang Hengqu's "Western Inscription" says it well, "The people are my brothers and sisters, and all things are my companions." Naturally, there should be no harsh picking, but if we are deceived by impostors, it is equivalent to being exploited by others. The more those parasites get, the less the truly pitiful people get. We must make choices.</p>
<p>Moreover, for this old nation, it is now suffering from all kinds of diseases. If there is no clear heat and detoxify the root cause, to stop many internal hidden dangers, the danger is indescribable. For example, there are so many pitiful people in society. If we act arbitrarily and enforce orders, I am afraid that the word "cruel" is not limited to the small matter of making a daughter eat chaff! Alas, what else is there to say!</p>
<h3>Mother's Love</h3>
<p>— Li Qingcheng</p>
<p>A few years ago, when Australia was hit by a drought, wild animals in the forest were so thirsty that they even dared to come to the doors of local residents to find water to drink, but these residents were also in bad luck. Their livestock, cattle and sheep, were also dying in droves due to lack of water, so the residents had to prepare a loaded gun at the door to be careful that this bit of precious water would not be drunk by wild animals.</p>
<p>On a hot summer day, a resident suddenly found a kangaroo running out of the forest, with a joey in its pouch. He immediately learned how to shoot, but the kangaroo slowly ran across the scorched open space around the house, getting closer and closer. Its brown, beautiful eyes were pleadingly staring at the resident, and it ran straight to the bucket of water, which was left for the livestock that had not yet died. The resident actually forgot to shoot.</p>
<p>It reached the bucket, stood there, its gentle eyes still staring at the resident. At this time, the joey in its pouch quickly drank enough. Immediately, it turned around, without drinking a drop of water itself, and ran across the open space towards the depths of the forest. The resident stared at it blankly, until it disappeared. He put down the gun, his heart feeling like it was stuffed with a heavy lead block.</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>

<p>The natural science teacher lectured on the story of Franklin's discovery of electricity. Little John, who was sitting in the back row, said: "You never study hard. After hearing Franklin's story, do you feel ashamed? But if you are willing to change from now on and study hard, you can also become like Franklin one day and become a great inventor."</p>
<p>Little John said softly: "Teacher, did Franklin discover electricity by reading it from books?"</p>
<h3>Thinking of Lenin's Death</h3>
<p>— Mao Ren</p>
<p>A few days ago, the newspaper reported the news that Soviet Marshal Stalin was ill, and the evening newspaper even reported that he had died in the Swiss capital. I think the news that Stalin is dead is just a rumor, because if Stalin dies, the Soviet Union has no need to keep the news secret. Lenin died on the night of January 21, 1924. On the morning of the 22nd, Chairman Kalinin convened the All-Soviet Congress to report the bad news. At that time, the Soviet Union was far more turbulent than it is today, yet it did not keep the news secret, let alone at a time of national prosperity and peace today.</p>
<p>The public announcement of Lenin's death was only a few words: "Vladimir Ilyich (Lenin was originally a pseudonym) suddenly became seriously ill on January 21. Breathing stopped and he fell into a coma at 5:10 pm; he died at 6:50 pm due to paralysis of the respiratory center." But the moment when Kalinin reported the bad news to the All-Soviet Congress was particularly moving. The congress convened at 11:50 am. Kalinin had not slept all night and his face was covered in tears. Everyone present knew that something was wrong and was uneasy. The Soviet funeral music began to play, but stopped immediately because Kalinin said, sobbing:</p>
<p>"I report to you all a terrible piece of news about our dear comrade Vladimir Ilyich."</p>
<p>A woman in the corridor began to sob softly, and a wave of crying followed.</p>
<p>"Yesterday," Kalinin continued in a trembling voice, "yesterday he suffered another paralysis, and—" He couldn't go on, as if he had no strength to utter the heavy words below. Then he spat out the word "died" with all his strength.</p>
<p>The sentimental Slavic temperament immediately broke out. The entire hall was filled with weeping, softly and mournfully. Kalinin couldn't speak. With great difficulty, he waited for everyone to calm down before reading the public announcement quoted above.</p>
<p>Apart from his confidants, others did not know that Lenin was terminally ill. Even those who were with him on the day of his death felt that his passing was unexpected. It turned out that on the morning of the 21st, Lenin went out hunting with Bukharin and a few others. He did not hunt, but sat on a sledge and watched with his head resting on a pillow. In the past two weeks, his condition had greatly improved, and everyone thought that it would be beneficial to his health. He was in good spirits when he returned, but he looked tired. The doctor advised him to sleep. He ate a hearty meal around three o'clock and then went to bed. In his sleep, the third and last paralysis came, and he never regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Lenin's last words were: "Look at that dog." It turned out that when he was concentrating on watching the hunt, a hunting dog brought a bird to Bukharin who was standing beside him. Lenin raised his hand and said: "Look at that dog." He never spoke again after that.</p>
<h3>Strange Eyes</h3>
<p>— Shi Shi</p>
<p>A certain sculptor in the south has eyes constructed like a microscope. He once carved the Eight Poems of Autumn Excitement and signed his name on a grain of rice, but although he could clearly see the tip of an autumn hair, he could not see ordinary objects even when they were only a foot away from him.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Misfortunes Never Come Singly (39)</p>
<p>Qiwan said: "Father got sick this time entirely because of me. He was worried about us coming out, afraid that something would happen to us. When he left, he repeatedly told me, gave me many business cards, and asked me to visit many people, meaning to ask people to take care of us. It can be seen how worried the old man was about us coming out this time. Last time, I received a letter from my eldest sister, which only said that the family was safe and that Father was also quite healthy. He disliked the lack of quiet at home and moved to a hotel in Shefansi. He didn't mention Father's illness at all, so I felt suspicious. But I didn't expect Father to be so ill, and the family was still hiding it from us. How can I be worthy of my father!" Saying this, she cried again. Although Hezhou comforted Qiwan, he was also heartbroken, and tears streamed down his face. Qiwan cried for a while, took out a stack of banknotes, handed them to Hezhou and said: "Brother, take this money back. This is the money that I slowly saved from 'small shares'. Take it back. If Father's illness has a chance of recovery, this money can help with medical expenses. In case of an accident, all kinds of expenses will be even greater. It's good to have it for emergencies." Speaking of this, the brother and sister hugged each other and cried again. Finally, Hezhou stopped crying and said: "I hope the old man will be blessed by the Buddha and turn danger into safety! I will rush back early tomorrow morning. Because of the contract, don't lose heart. You still have to sing hard and protect our reputation." Qiwan said: "How can I have the mood to sing?" Hezhou said: "This is related to our future. You can't help but grit your teeth and do it!" Qiwan cried: "This bowl of rice in the opera industry can't be eaten. After this contract is over, I will change careers and never sing opera again!" Saying this, she cried again. That night, the brother and sister talked and cried, and didn't sleep all night. The next day, Qiwan looked in the mirror, and her eyes were red and swollen. She said to Hezhou: "Brother, I can't go to the station to see you off. When you get to Peiping, send a telegram first, so I can feel relieved!" Hezhou agreed one by one. That day, he took the express train back. When he arrived in Peiping, he took a rickshaw from the station back home. As the rickshaw pulled into the alley, he saw from afar that a shed was set up in his yard. A wave of sadness surged in his heart, and he assumed that his father was no longer in this world and that the family had set up a mourning shed to handle the funeral. When the rickshaw got closer, he saw that it was the canopy of the neighbor's house. He hurriedly got out of the rickshaw and rushed home. His father was lying in bed, already on the verge of death, but his mind was still clear. Hezhou leaned over the bed and called "Father" several times. He gasped and barely replied, reaching out to hold Hezhou's hand, and said shortly: "Child, you're back, good, good!" He barely opened his lifeless eyes and looked at the bed, and said: "Child, where's your sister? Qiwan, Qiwan!" He only said these few words and fell into a coma again. It lasted until seven o'clock the next morning, when this generation of famous actors opened his eyes, looked at his children kneeling around the bed, showed a reluctant look, and left his children behind, passing away. Hezhou cried for a while and hurriedly prepared for the funeral, and sent a telegram to notify Qiwan. Qiwan suffered a sudden disaster and asked Guo Fang for leave. The theater had to agree out of human kindness, only requiring that she come back immediately after the funeral in Peiping was over, no matter what, the situation here relied on her to maintain it, and sent a generous gift.</p>
<h3>Yue Fei's Poems</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi</p>
<p>The Collection of Yue Zhongwu Wang, published in bookstores, was compiled by people of the Qing Dynasty, and mostly collected from the Jintuo Cuibian, which is not exhaustive. And its preface takes the posthumous title of Wumu as Yue Fei's special honor, as if no one before and after was given the posthumous title of Wumu to compete with Yue Fei. This is even more inappropriate. Yue Fei's initial posthumous title was Wumu, and his posthumous title was changed to Zhongwu, which is better than Wumu. It is appropriate to mention Zhongwu, not to quibble about Wumu. Moreover, in ancient times, Li Guangbi of the Tang Dynasty was given the posthumous title of Wumu, and Liu Qi, who lived at the same time as Fei, was also given this title. Is it only Yue Fei who received this posthumous title? With such a superficial view, no wonder their collection is not extensive. Among the articles in the collection that can be passed down, only the Ci of Man Jiang Hong is most popular. But the Bintui Lu records: "In the Gui Chou year of Shaoxing, Yue Wumu led troops to pacify the bandits in Qianji Fa. On the way out of Xin'gan, he inscribed a poem on the wall of the Xiaosi Temple in Qingni City, saying: Heroic spirit towers to the sky, I vow to repay the emperor with integrity, Slay all the stubborn and evil to return the chariot, Not asking to be rewarded with ten thousand households. During the Chunxi period, Lin Ling (Zi) wanted to engrave it on stone, but he was dismissed and failed to do so. Now the temple is abandoned and the wall is gone. His grandson categorized the family collection, but unfortunately, he had no one to tell him." Although the poem is not as good as the Ci of Man Jiang Hong, it is generous and heroic. Zhongwu's life-long ambition and integrity are also fully expressed. The collection does not contain it, which is unavoidable regret. I have transcribed it to make up for it. According to Han (Shizhong) and Yue, both Zhongwu rose from the ranks of soldiers, and both were able to write poetry and Ci, which is also a wonder. (Although King Han has no special collection, his poems and Ci are repeatedly seen in the novels of the Song Dynasty.) However, the Ci of Han Zhongwu were mostly written after retirement, so they have a clear, elegant, and indifferent charm, which has masked the original face of the spirit of swallowing the Hu, and is completely different from the sadness and gratitude of Yue Zhongwu. However, it was not King Han's original intention. Every time I read his Ci, I can't help but sigh three times. Because I talked about Yue Zhongwu's poems, I have added this.</p>
<h3>New Methods of Curing Crime</h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>The word "治" (zhì) originally had the meaning of "healing," such as in "治病" (zhì bìng, to cure an illness). However, judges have always "治罪" (zhì zuì, to punish) criminals, often simply administering retribution like "an eye for an eye," without delving into the reasons behind people's crimes and prescribing appropriate remedies to fundamentally eliminate the motivation for committing crimes. In fact, today's prisons tend to become "crime factories." Someone who initially goes astray is often influenced by hardened criminals who have no fear of the law, becoming bolder and more reckless. Once released, they become even more dangerous bandits.</p>
<p>Now, the American judicial system has widely adopted the opinion offered by criminologists: "Treating crime as treating illness." The results are worth noting. Here are a few examples. Although the cases are small, the measures taken by the judges are very meaningful.</p>
<p>There was a chicken thief who had been arrested many times, but after being released, he always "remained incorrigible" and continued to steal. Later, a clever judge helped him set up a small farm and told him to raise chickens. Once the chicken thief became a farm owner, he loved chickens as much as his own life. He not only became law-abiding but also became the most vehemently anti-chicken thief person in the area. He worked diligently and became moderately wealthy.</p>
<p>There was a car driver who often liked to drive extremely fast and was arrested many times for causing trouble. Later, he ran over and killed a child. The presiding judge told him to go to the morgue and take a good look at the child's bloody corpse. As a result, he changed his ways.</p>
<p>A woman sued her husband for treating her badly because he only gave her twenty dollars a month for expenses. The judge's ruling was that the husband's entire income should be temporarily deposited in the bank. Apart from the twenty dollars given to his wife, he himself was only allowed to use twenty dollars per month. As a result, the husband sincerely repented, and the couple reconciled.</p>
<p>Another woman went to court to sue her husband, saying that he often beat her and never went out with her. When the judge summoned the husband for questioning, the husband said, "Look at how ugly she is, yet she refuses to agree to a divorce. How can I not be angry?" The judge came up with an idea that perhaps only an American judge could come up with: he told the man to take out a sum of money and have the woman go to a beauty salon for a makeover! As a result, everything has been peaceful ever since. I didn't expect that Heng Niang in my country's *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* would have found a like-minded friend in the legal world overseas!</p>
<h3>Visiting the Former Residence of Mr. Gui Youguang (Zhenchuan)</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>I have lived in Anting for half a year. One reason is that it is the ancestral home of my family. Although I was not born there, when one reaches middle age, one cannot help but have a sense of longing for one's roots. Another reason is that it is where the great Ming Dynasty writer Gui Youguang (Zhenchuan) once lived. Every time I wander among the broken walls and rubble of the Zhenchuan Academy north of the town, I am always filled with a sense of reverence and attachment to this lyrical master whom I have admired immensely. With these two reasons, I unhesitatingly left the old residence where I had lived for more than thirty years and resolutely moved here.</p>
<p>The place where I live now is at the southern edge of the town, about a mile away from my ancestral home and Zhenchuan Academy. However, separated by only a single embankment, it is where Mr. Zhenchuan often lived and studied during his lifetime! It is the site of the Shimei Hall. The Shimei Hall was originally the property of the Wang family, the family of Lingchuan's wife, built during the Zhengde reign of the Ming Dynasty, "with hundreds of rooms, spacious halls, and extremely elegant." It can be seen that this building was quite grand. During the Jiajing reign, the Wang family declined and mortgaged it to pay off debts. At that time, Mr. Zhenchuan happened to be living and studying at his wife's family. After discussing it with his wife, because Madam Wang could not bear "the grief of wandering in the fields of millet," and Mr. Zhenchuan also loved its quiet location, they decided that he would repay the debt in installments and redeem it. West of the hall, there were originally some beautiful ponds, forests, rocks, and hills. There was also a pavilion on the hill, which Mr. Zhenchuan named the Weilei Pavilion, and wrote a record of the Weilei Pavilion, which contains the meaning of "people abandon, I take," escaping the world and transforming customs. Later, when his eldest son, who he was often with, died, he also built the Sizi Pavilion there. When we read the "Record of the Sizi Pavilion," and read "Wandering around, looking around, the long sky is vast, stretching my eyes to the clouds and apricot trees, there must be a day when I see my son coming back," we can imagine Mr. Gui's deep love for his son at that time, making us, hundreds of years later, still sigh and weep.</p>
<p>However, to say it is shameful, I have lived here for half a year, and I have always wanted to visit the former residence of the great writer, which is so close at hand and which I admire so much, but I have never realized it. Although it is said that for the sake of life, I cannot put down my pen for a moment, it is still close to abandoning it. Recently, "the cold wind is bleak, and the leaves are falling," I have been working at my desk all day long, hunched over, and suddenly I remembered the famous line in Mr. Zhenchuan's "Record of the Weilei Pavilion," recalling his situation at that time of "calling my son to drink wine and singing on the hill," I could not help but yearn for it. So I threw down my pen, put on my hat, and decided to go for a walk.</p>
<p>Going downstairs and out the door, facing the north wind, crossing the small bridge, and passing the Jingtian Bridge to the west, then turning back south, crossing a small wooden railing bridge, I arrived in the fields. Looking west towards the Yangtze River, except for the distant villages, the ground is flat, and only the withered yellow color can be seen. At this time, my heart was already filled with a sense of desolation. So, according to the Anting Town Chronicle, I followed the road to what is called the site of the Shimei Hall. But there were only withered bamboo and semi-forest, and no sign of wall foundations or pillars. It seemed that there had been no buildings for a long time. Even the Wanfu Bridge north of the hall, a three-section stone beam, had its connecting part on the other side of the river broken. Walking on the bridge, looking back, the view was desolate, and it was unbearable to look at it for long. Looking down at the broken beam, the stream flowed gently, but no fish could be seen swimming. At this time, the north wind was even stronger, blowing people down, so I stepped off the bridge and wanted to ask someone for directions. But this was the time for the evening meal, and there was no one around, not even the cowherds or villagers could be seen. Walking slowly south again, I unknowingly reached the highway. I looked back occasionally and saw several red walls interspersed among the white walls and black tiles of the town. Those were the famous temples here. Seeing these, I suddenly imagined that Gui Zhenchuan, a literary giant of a generation, whose articles were read and whose name was known by all those who inspected the schools, but his residence was not respected by anyone, and only a very few people even knew that he existed. It was not as good as the local gods of the land and fire, who were worshipped everywhere, and I couldn't help but feel indignant!</p>
<p>After returning, sitting quietly in the room, I pondered deeply: Almost all famous writers in history were frustrated in life and lonely after death. No wonder Mr. Lu Xun's will did not allow his own son to become a literary figure. Thinking of the words "literary figure," I couldn't help but be shocked. From this, I realized why most people in rural towns and villages only know to respect the gods of the land and fire and do not worship writers. Think about it: rural life relies entirely on land production, and the most important things for people's livelihood are food and work, and without fire, food cannot be cooked, and work cannot be done at night. The gods of the land and fire, who provide them with the most essential needs, naturally cannot help but feel grateful and respectful. Even if the articles of writers are beneficial to body and mind, and are said to be the spiritual food that mankind cannot do without, these spiritual foods, no matter how nourishing, have always been enjoyed by only a few people in the past and present. So, it is not without reason that Gui Zhenchuan, a literary figure of a generation, is not as loved by the local people in his place of residence as the local gods of the land and fire.</p>
<p>This article was originally intended to express my feelings of longing for the past, but it only expressed some shallow feelings. However, my indignant heart was calmed down by this.</p>

<h3>Saint Dijon Orphanage Appeals for Donations: Foreign Children are Crying for Food and Eagerly Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>The Saint Dijon Orphanage at 95 Shaoxing Road in this city, run by Western expatriates in Shanghai, houses more than 60 orphaned children of White Russian and other nationalities. Recently, due to financial difficulties, it is hard to maintain, so a fundraising committee was formed to appeal for donations from all parties. A reporter from this newspaper visited the orphanage authorities a few days ago, who stated: "Each of the orphans housed in the orphanage requires about one million French francs per month, so the monthly expenses required are at least 60 million francs. If we could obtain sixty philanthropists to donate one million francs per month on a long-term basis, the financial problem could be solved." At this time of severe winter, these homeless foreign vagrant children urgently need the relief of enthusiastic people, which is also a way to express international friendship. The orphanage's office is located at the Cao Zuo Shi Tang Sheng Accounting Firm in the Asia Building, No. 1 Wai Tan, Zhengdong Road, in this city. The person in charge is Mr. Peng Sheng, an Englishman. Readers who are interested in helping can contact him directly at that address, or this column can forward it on your behalf.</p>
