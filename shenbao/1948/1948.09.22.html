<h3>國營事業發售股票　係予人民投資機會　王財長稱商股比例將來可考慮提高</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕財長王雲五離京前發姿談話，略謂：關於國營事業股票之發售，現已開始在滬辦理，因事屬創辦，社會一般認識對於發售辦法之內容及政府之立意容有尙欠明瞭之處，願就此稍有說明，以供人民投資承購時之參考。查此次發售股票之國營事業，共有中紡公司·招商局·台灣糖業公司·台灣紙業公司·天津紙漿公司五單位，均為目前政府管理下設備最佳，營業　甚，而前途最有希望之生產或建設事業，政府為誘　并輔助私人資本獲得正當之發展起見特將上述五單位之股票先以一部份分別出售，藉予人民以一最有利之機會參加投資，故發售股票實爲政府與人民兩方之共同利益着想。關於全部股票之發行金額，係依照其資產總値之最低估計，從嚴核計，共爲金圓券十七億五千三百餘萬元，實際上遠較各該事業之目前市價爲低，且政府所保留之股權部份，須移交金圓劵發行準備監理委會保管，併充金圓券發行準備，是股票價値是否能與票面相稱，該會當有所考核，決不容許高估。至發售民營部份，爲金圓劵五億六千四百萬元，約佔總額三分之一，衡諸過去一般官商合股之銀行或廠鑛，此次比例已不爲少，且依照政府決定，商股部份俟招足十分之一時，卽可召集股東大會。關於公司之行政管理，股票持有人自可在會主張，所推舉之董·監事更可參加實際指導工作，今後公司如何經營，亦當嚴格依據公司法之規定辦理。故政府方面對於公司資產之估價，股權分配之比例，以及商股之合法權益等等，均充分顧及，將來政府幷當考慮提高商股比例，增加發售數額，以便人民有依法控制各公司之機會與權力，而逐漸趨向於全體民營之道路。</p>

<h3>勤儉運動與國民責任</h3>
<p>自本月十五日晚，總統廣播演說，號召動儉建國運動以來，各地人民莫不熱烈響應，以爲這確是配合經濟緊急處分令的必要措施。因爲社會經濟的健全，其基本原則，實不外乎兩項，一為增加生產，一為節約消費，而勤勞乃是積極的增產之要件，節儉又是消極的保產所必　。所以一切經濟改革，惟有實行這勤儉兩字，方是澈首澈尾的精神所在，其餘都不過是技術上的節目而已。</p>
<p>凡稍知自愛的人，大抵皆知道，自食其力，乃是立身處世之必要條件，至於仰人為活，完全倚賴的人，卽六婦人女子，　癃殘廢之徒，亦多認為可恥。所以各盡其力，各取所需，此理理為一般人所易曉，而其陷人最深，誤世最烈則通病，却屬於惡勞好佚，同趨於分利的一羣，換句話說，卽在避開生產，不務正業，而只知千方百計，拾人餘瀝，或竟巧取豪奪，瘠人自肥的那一班人。</p>
<p>說到勤勞，這些不務正業而巧取豪奪的人，亦未始不在加緊工作，甚有觸禁氾法，行險徼倖，不惜拿生命來作孤注一擲的。例如專事投機操縱的奸商，其用心之勸，費力之苦、亦何嘗在一般正當農工商人之下？然而搗亂市而，卽是此輩，破壞經濟，亦卽是此輩。可知勤字的含義，乃專指一切正當職業與正式職務而言，並非任何勤勞，俱値得提倡與稱揚的。</p>
<p>節儉同是美德，而其適用的範圍，亦殊有大小與公私的分別。例如製造一種物品，明明有本國原料可用，而以迎合時尙，增加利潤故，寗可捨國產而用洋貨；又如採辦一種工具或用品，以價或較廉，質或較好故，亦寗可避國貨而趨舶來。這就他個人打算，亦未嘗不可說是節約，而就整個的國民經濟說來，則又未免是大量的浪費了。</p>
<p>因此之故，我們以為勤儉的價値，不應單從其個人的觀點來衡量，而應從社會或國家的立塲來判斷。凡是眞正有裨於國計民生的，其人方嘗動儉可風，方够得上予以讚揚。這是今日提倡儉勸運動時所應當首先注意的。倘如上文所述那些投機奸商的很勁，與只知唯利是圖的洋貨用戶看來，在某種意義上，雖亦或可冠以勤儉的名詞，但斷乎談不上建國，而毋寧說是國民經濟的基礎，反被這些自私自利之徒所摧毀了。</p>
<p>我們日前在「響應勤儉建國運動」的一文中，曾說到，這種運動，要希望它訊速收效，須得當世的大人先生來提倡。這原是要他們以身作則的意思，並不是專靠他們來主持·因為提倡動儉的效果、雖屬於經濟的意義上為多，而這種運動的本質，却是社會性的，敎育性的，不是經濟性的，更不是政治性的。總統說過：「推行之道，要在身體力行，人人以克勤克儉的作風，表現於日常生活之中」·這是何等廣泛的一種運動！要是每一個國民不把這種規律，適用到日常生活的每一角落裏，則其宗旨便不算貫澈，其收效亦决不會甚宏。所以這項運動，總統並不以全國政治首長的身份來發動，而特以國民一分子的資格來提倡，卽明示這是十種社會改革運動，要希望社會各階層的民衆來共同担荷，共同參加，斷不可把這過仔肩完全寄托在少數人的身上。經騐吿訴我們，這一類移風易俗的使命，倘沒有大家的自警自覺來做基礎，而要單靠政治的力量來推動，那是斷不會有十分良好的結果的·他姑不論，單拿過去的什麽什麽運動來看，豈不是一個很明顯的例子？但是這項動儉建國運動，其目的是在配合新經濟的措施；同時亦是配合戡亂的某本工作，同樣是只許成功，不許失敗的·所以一面要一般大人先生自動自覺，躬行實踐，來做表率，做領導，一面仍希望各階層的民衆大家憬然覺悟，共同起來踴躍參加。</p>

<h3>擴大對日貿易制度　除物物將換外日可以現金訂購　對日貿易指會週五復會</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕幣制改革以來，各地收兌黃金白銀及外幣之成績，至為良好，據組略之估計，由八月廿三日迄九月十八日止，共收兌金銀外幣數目，折合美金已達一億三千九百十三萬餘元。其中以第四週之枚兌數目最多，竟達六千三百餘萬美元。收兌期已定於本月廠截止。政府且公開宣佈，絕不延長收兌日期。從下月起，凡人民持有黃金白銀及外幣者，均為犯罪。除將所持金銀外幣沒收外，並得處罰七年以下之有期徒刑。故咸信在本遇及下週初之收兌歡目，尤將激增。又上述收兌數字，僅為中央社記者根據承德，貴陽，昆明，靑島，成都，開封，南昌，重慶，桂林，西安，北平，鎭江，太原，長沙，武漢，杭州，蘭州，廣州，台灣，上海，天津及南京等廿二重要城市刊載於報紙上之每日收兌數目初步統計而得。其正確數目，殊有距離。全國各地之實際收兌數字，當較上述估計者為大。</p>

<h3>莫斯科談判已告失敗　三外長諮商頻繁　駐蘇三使節應召抵巴黎　柏林問題是否提交聯大尙未決定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿一日電〕西方三强駐莫斯科之使節，可望於今日抵此參加三國外長於下午六時在法外交部舉行之第二次會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿一日電〕西方三强駐蘇代表羅伯茲史密斯及夏台岳，今晨在此間乖飛機赴巴黎。在乘機離莫斯科前，法大使夏台岳宣佈渠將在巴黎作短期勾留，以便與法外長許曼會商，然後再返草斯科。英特使羅伯茲亦發表相同之聲明稱，英外相貝文欲知草斯科談判之情形如何，美駐蘇大使史密斯則未有何聲明發表。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿日合衆電〕英美法三國駐莫斯科使節，均已應召赴巴黎，與三國外長有所會商。渠等與莫洛托夫就柏林危機所作之爲期七週之談判已吿終結，打開僵局之企圖可謂完全失敗。柏林及德國一般局勢，現須由馬歇爾貝文及許曼三人與蘇外次維辛斯基商談。維辛斯基為出席巴黎聯大之蘇聯首席代表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿一日電〕如西方三强外長決定正式將柏林問題，列大會或安理會議程，則蘇聯勢將辯認柏林及德國問題係在四强管轄權限之內，而三强則將力稱一切達成協議之努力均吿失敗，蘇聯之封鎖仍朱解除。西方三强尙未決定將柏林問題提出大會抑安理會，　二者實互有短長。在安理會中，蘇聯享有否決權，蘇聯可能再像一九四六年對論伊朗問題時那樣，這出會塲。但是不將柏林問題列入大會議程，俾避免東西間致死結，則可能使大會有更多之時間處理其他問題，一且解決之機會亦將較佳。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎二十日電〕馬歇爾。貝文與許曼今日在法外部會談一小時，對柏林危機作初步談話。傳此次會議可確示柏林問題之莫斯科談判階段，至此已吿終結。在聯大會議上之其他重要問題，亦為東西間危機之陰影所籠罩·三强外長及參加二十晚會議之高級隨員等，均未露一絲笑容。隨馬鄭出席者有共和黨外交專家可能在杜威上合時出任美國務卿之杜爾斯，國務院顧問波倫，駐英大使陶格拉斯及駐法大使賈弗萊。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林二十日電〕德境美軍總司令克萊中將，已於廿日晚飛赴巴黎，與馬歇爾國務卿會談。聯大會於廿一日在巴黎揭幕。圖示法外長許曼（右）將金鑰匙一把交予聯合國秘書長賴依，此卽說明舉行會議之夏樂宮，不屬法國領土之內，該宮内各國代表均得享受治外法機。（英國新聞處）</p>
<h3>蘇聯又一宣傳攻勢　要求德境盟軍撤退</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：柏林蘇聯陸軍官報載稱：蘇聯要求駐於德國及柏林之各國佔領軍隊立刻全部撤回。該報以德國與韓國相比擬，促使德人注意蘇聯在韓國所採之行動，卽準備將蘇軍於本年年底前全部撤離韓國·華盛頓官方認為蘇聯此項要求，乃一種宣傳攻勢，藉以博得德人之同情。</p>
<p>〔合眾社柏林廿一日電〕觀察家評論蘇佔領軍機關報要求一切佔領軍撤出德國事稱，蘇聯之要求，係基於其深信一旦西方盟國軍隊撤出柏林後，共黨行動隊及蘇聯訓練之德國民軍將能輕而易舉地佔領柏林。據最近德國報紙所載消息稱，武裝之德共行動隊正在蘇區工廠內組成，同樣之團體並將立卽在柏林之工廠內開始組織。觀察家並認為蘇聯要求之提出，在時間上採用與巴黎聯大會開幕相吻合的策略，如蘇聯不能阻止聯合國討論柏林危機，則顯將提出一項解決辦法，卽四强同時從柏林撤軍。</p>
<h3>共黨叛亂純為印尼內政　不容荷任何干涉　印尼政府拒絕荷聯合防共建議</h3>

<h3>印尼政府與共黨　未正式開火</h3>
<p>政府宣布已能控制全局</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞二十日電〕馬迪城共黨所控制之電台二十日宣稱：「爪哇蘇維埃共和國」業已成立，由莫斯科訓練之共產黨慕沙任主席。據悉：由於印尼共黨發生政變之危險，此間聯合國官員準備將現在共和國區內之三國代表團遣返。按比·澳·義三國使團，原定在印尼區勾留三個月，又訊：印尼與荷蘭已在爪哇中部發生激戰。共產黨控制之馬迪恩電台斥責印尼共和國走上向荷蘭及英國投降之政策，將印尼出賣與美資本家。該電合幷廣播共黨政府之命令，命守衛隊在城中各主要大樓中佈崗。自共產黨發動政變以還，已歷四十八小時，然尙未接護共和國與共黨間發生戰爭之消息。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿一日電〕印尼共和國政府二十一日稱，軍事當局已阻止共黨在塞馬拉之騷動。報吿中並稱：高級軍事及內政官員至少十四人，正在視察曾有騷動之西海岸城市。據稱：武裝衝突之情形極少，軍方人事極少被殺。最後，該項廣播稱：政府已能控制全部局勢。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華雄頓廿一日電〕一般認為歐洲美空軍司令李梅中將擢升為空軍戰略司令，係警吿蘇聯的一種暗示，蘇聯固深知李梅將軍，卽為主持三閱月來的柏林空運而打破蘇聯封鎖的人物。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿一日電〕美遠東空軍總部頃宣稱：　脫少將業已卸除蘇五航空隊總司令之職務，返美祖任華盛頓美空軍總部之職。其遺缺由現在華府空軍總部之派泰列奇少將繼任，派氏卽將抵日。</p>

<p>張亞民押入看守所後，警備部卽禁止其接見任何親友及家屬，故張直至昨日下午二時許獄卒為其開鐐時，始知死期已至，當卽索取紙筆，預作遺書。三時正，軍法處曾處長親至看守所，設案提張出獄。張經兩月牢獄生活，略見淸瘦，衣白底藍條睡衣褲，黃色絞皮鞋，風度如　。曾處長詢明姓名年齡籍續貫，吿以奉命於今日執行。此時張神經突呈緊張，要求發言，卽謂，「我為上海五百萬市民利益而工作，今被犧牲而未為五百萬市民所瞭解」。似有不勝寃屈然。又謂：「我是爭權奪利傾軋中之犧牲者」。庭上人員為使其减少臨刑痛苦，勸其飮高梁酒一大碗，並為注射麻醉針。曾處長批畢斬條，卽由特務連兵士及憲兵押上刑車，駛赴江灣刑塲。車抵刑塲，張已昏然失去知覺，由憲兵挾持下車，俯臥於地，特務班班長唐少武持步槍瞄凖射擊，一彈畢命，彈自背心入，前胸穿出</p>

<h3>解決肉荒　商定三點　批發價准酌予調整　零售絕對不得逾限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局昨晨十時會局財政局，衛生局，警察局，召集鮮肉，豬行及鮮猪三業公會代表談話，商定：（一）屠宰塲所以後不得作交易，由社會警察二局會銜佈吿，並由警局派員經常監督。（二）在來源缺乏時，務肉批發價在零售價不變之原則下，准予調整爲毛猪每斤公斤七角四分，鮮肉每市斤五角五分。各零售商由鮮肉業公會監督，絕對不得超過八一九限價。（三）菜塲價格由警局嚴密監督。</p>

<h3>南國金圓悲喜劇</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　梁風</p>
<p>這個亞熱帶的南國，早晨和晚上，雖然已有陣陣的金風次送，但在中午，却還是皓日當空，　陽似火，街頭上的人們，違是穿着單衣走來走去。作為消暑勝地的荔枝灣，遊人依然如過江之　，然鬧不减往時。而中秋節的晚上，更有不少人們，到那裏去泛舟賞月，這更是南方特有的景色。</p>
<p>的確，秋在南國，是一個最受人歡迎的季節。特別是今年，隨着秋風吹來幣制改革的消息，使人尤其興奮。這興奮本來是全國各地都一樣，不過在這裏則表現得更加强烈。因為這個華南唯一大都市的廣州，密邇香港澳門，自從復員以後，由於港幣在市塲上作祟，使金融動盪，物價狂昇，近兩年來的一般生活程度，竟高出京滬一倍以上，而華南的工商業，更幾乎完全窒息。誰都彷彿在經濟的第一綫上作戰，迄無喘息的機會，而民生痛苦，更不堪言，所以常這新幣制的命令頒行，華南的人士，正如久旱逢甘露，大家怎會不熱烈歡迎呢？　這次幣制的改革，不消說是中國經濟史上嶄新的一頁，而且是關係到戡亂建國，整個民族的前途，像這樣一個重要的決策推行，自然不能各方面都顧慮得完全週到，所以金圃券在廣州發行以後，到現在將及一月，在這期間裏，也發生過若干的悲喜劇：</p>
<p>痛苦犧牲無可避免在改幣以後，金融不會再波動，正當的工商業可以甦生，民生痛苦的桎梏可以從此解除，可是，在改幣的命令頒布後，在廣東的人們，却先受到一種為其他地方所無的損失。就是「八·一九」那天拿着的法幣，第二天便少了一半，這原因便是：宋子文主粤後，由於實施緊縮通貨，制止游資南流，及取締投機等關係，做成「申電」低跌，八月十九日前，「申電」低至五零，卽是由廣州匯款五十萬元，在上海便可收到一百萬元。當時上海港幣黑市，每元値法幣二百餘萬元，而廣州每元還是値一百一十萬元左右。金圓發行後，一律規定港幣每元値法幣二百二十五萬元，這和上海的原値是相差不遠，但在廣州便增加了一倍，那不是廣州人當時手上拿着的法幣，眼巴巴看住便少了一半嗎？所以宋主席在八月廿三日，金融物價座談會席上，特別指出：「金圓發行後，目前當然有不可避免之困難，而在廣東人民所感受之痛苦，較之其他各地為甚……切望我百粤人士，深明大義，雖因改革幣制而感受相當困難，但此關係於整個國家民族之生存，人人都要有犧牲精神，忠實奉行政府改革幣制實施緊急處分之法令。」這足見他因對廣東人的同情，而要懇切的攱勵。</p>
<p>金融物價平地飛昇正因為這裏有着：規定港幣的差價離得太遠，走私未能戢止，這種種特殊的關係，使改幣一宣布後，金融便發生劇烈變動，物價更平地飛昇，較之歷次金融漲風，祗有過之而無不及。到了八月廿三至廿六幾天，市府將主要的民生必需品先後評定公價，但因檢查不够嚴厲，一般不肖商人，依然高抬物價，而金融投機家，更興風作浪，又做成港幣的黑市，把金圓故意低折，照規定金圓七十五圓直港幣一百元。但有一個很短的時期，黑市港幣竟牽至和金圓平換，這時市面混亂情形，為過去所未有。</p>
<p>市府省參筆墨戰爭同時，市府所評定各物的公價，一般人均認為評得過高，較之八月十九日以前，平均增漲達一倍，使民生增加困苦。粤穗的國代，立委，監委，參議會，市黨部等，均一致指摘。粤省參議會更上電蔣總統，請嚴飭經管督導負澈查究辦，於是又引起省參會和市府的一段筆墨官司：市府九月十一日發表在全市各報刊載其「評價經過及其原則」，洋洋萬言，縷述本市為一消費市塲，一切物品要靠外圍輸入，如定價過低，則恐妨絕市，故物價評定的原則，是按八月十九日價格，及合理的成本，並要顧慮到减縮生產，减少來源等問題；並指省參會為「不顧事實」。於是省參諸公，便更加憤慨，卽決定起草駁斥市府文吿，並搜集證據再呈總統，這由物價而引起的糾紛，現還在發展中</p>
<p>武松來了爆竹歡迎</p>
<p>在這壞，還有一個有趣的插曲：大約在一星期以前，這裏便有蔣經國先生會到廣州來的傳說，他們給蔣先生一個雅號呌做「武松」。在中秋節前兩日，忽然到處燃放鞭爆，有人說今天「武松」來了！所以放爆竹歡迎，連街上的警察都這樣說，使記者也嚇了一跳，因為這消息豈不是要走漏？連忙到處訪查，原來却是一個什麼神誕，才不禁恍然失笑。不過，這也多少可以看出，一般民衆的喁喁望治之心吧。</p>
<p>經濟管制嚴厲執法</p>
<p>本月三四五幾日，上海的資金大量逃港，港匯墨市激增，這裏物價波動仍未稍止。但在八·九兩天以後，則又完全安定下來了。因為廣州區的經濟管制督導員辦公處，是六日才正式辦公，接着並照上海例，成立了物價審議，檢查及物資調節三個委員會·八日宋兼督導負子文，發佈了限制匯款的辦法，以阻止上海資金南逃。其時，霍寳樹更以「戰士」的姿態，担任着經濟管制的協導員，他對人說：他這次回家鄕來辦經管工作，將嚴厲執法，絕不徇私，雖然是斷絕六親，祖墳被人掘去，他也在所不惜，這樣來表示他的祗許成功的決心。而在檢查工作方面，更發出了雷　萬鈞的壓力，動員了全部駐市的憲警軍人員，作普遍的檢查，連日破獲私設的電台達十餘處，拘獲買賣金融及抬高物價者二百餘人。</p>
<p>金圓前途光明璀燦操縱黑市金融的大本營「十三行」，則一片風聲鶴唳，誰再敢以身試法？有些平時專營這勾當的銀縷，也有多家自動的停業了。這樣把黑市的金融活動，完全遏止，物價便安定下來。尤其在中秋節前，銀根緊俏，各行局兌換金圓券的情形，更踴躍空前，雖週日亦不停止兌換，但仍有應接　暇之槪。更有些存得外幣較多的人，因為急於需要金圓週轉，便願將港幣照七一·七二的比率，來兌換給行莊，這種港幣黑市低於公價的現象，實在是復員以來所未有的。從這裏也可以看到金圓券的前金的光明。</p>
<h3>用匪竄擾揚泰公路伏擊汽車阻刧輪船</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿日訊〕揚泰公路廣福橋附近，十六日一度遭匪竄擾，當日晨泰揚汽車公司客車一輛，載客二十餘，午時行經該處突遭伏匪以機槍阻擊，司機仍快速向東疾駛，於一時許抵秦縣。司機唐學士左手指為彈片擊傷，因車行太速，乘客不堪顧簸，三人受碰撞輕傷。同日，由鎭江開秦州之「協　」輪，拖帶木船兩隻，行抵廣福橋附近之王家河·匪徒四名，鳴槍　令停航，停靠後四匪相奉登輪，令旅客登陸檢查，歷一小時，搜去步槍四支，旅客皮包一隻，餘無傷害，該輪晚八時股險抵泰城。又：同日由泰開鎭之班輪，行近王家河時，發現前面有匪警，隨卽轉鎭回泰，故無損失·連日經江都，泰縣兩縣駐軍於揚泰，揚鎭水陸通路一帶捕剿，散匪均已遠　，兩綫交通，恢復常態。</p>
<h3>律師界大集會閉幕前後</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　王公瀚</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日訊〕當立法院九月七日在京復會，憲政督導委員會於九月九日在京成立之際，負有執行國家法律保障人民權利自由使命的律師界，正也進行着一個大集會，這便是：「中華民國律師公會全國聯合會」的在京成立，與該會之「一屆會員代表大會」的相繼召開。</p>
<p>因為這個集會在素質上顯然的是不同於一般職業公會之集會的，從九月九日（該會成立的一天）到九月十四日（該會會員代表大會閉幕的一天）是以它曾一直受着立法院·司法行政部·社會部以及國民黨中央組織部等當局注意。上述諸當局先後舉行茶會招待該會全體代表，六日中共有五次之多，便可見一斑。又司法行政部之廳德顧問，對該集會似更頗感興趣，曾特發表演說數次。</p>
<p>籌組經過</p>
<p>律師界在戰前嘗有「全國律師協會」一組織，係以「自然人」為單位者。戰後，緣於時代背景不同，乃有以「法人」為單位之「全國律師公會聯合會」籌組。查全國各地律師公會現計有百〇四單位，該聯合會的籌組，係由京·滬·平·津·武漢·廣州·西安·成都·長春等廿九個單位所發起，經籌備委員律師戴修瓚·江一平·兪鍾駱·戴天球等半年之奔走計劃，同時在人力物力之配合下，終於完成了這一律師界的時代組織。</p>
<p>大會盛況</p>
<p>該會成立大會，係九月九日上午九時在此間中山北路華僑招待所舉行者，曾到有司法院長王寵惠，立法院長孫科，社會部長谷正綱，司法行政部長謝冠生，行政法院院長張知本等。總統曾特頒訓詞。「代表大會」係十日起假上乘庵營造業公會二樓逐日進行者，到會代表最終總數達百卅三人。其中甚多是法學界權威，有律師與立委雙重身份者計有江一平，朱文德，方冀達，武誓彭，翟念劬，劉蓬瀛等。有律師與國大代表雙重身份者計有戴天球，張旦平，金春華，程神林，王善祥，丘昭文，陳維，兪俊珠，陸惠民，張寰治，蘇尙文等。他如軍士釗，郭衛等，均曾由滬趕來京參加，眞可說是濟濟一堂。</p>
<p>重要決議</p>
<p>在深通法理專家們的心目中，國家現行法律，有些是已不合時效，或根大與民主憲政之現實要求，已大相違背的，因此，他們在他們的大集會上，基於國家民主憲政之法的立塲，提出建議立法與司法行政當局，廢止或修正道些法律，以及訂立新的合乎現實要求的法律之議案，竟有一百數十件之多，其中最重要已經大會通過者計有：（一）「建議立院從速制定寃獄賠償法，」（二）「建議立院廢除各項特種刑事條例及刑事案件訴訟條例」，（三）「建議當局修正陸海空軍審判法」等。</p>
<p>關於（一）——「建議立院從速寃獄賠償法」，據云：曾係過去之「全國律師協會」，民廿年到廿六年歷屆大會努力之一個目標，茲値國家行憲時代庶政一新，創議多年的寃獄賠償法制度，的確有及時建立之必要。據記者探悉：這一決議案，在立院方面已有反應，已經準備即時制定這項法律。</p>
<p>關於（二）「建議立法院廢除各項特種刑事條例及刑事案件訴訟條例」，他們的決定在基點上自然仍係基於民主憲政，以維八權而昭愼重。</p>
<p>關於（三）「建議當局修正陸海空軍審判法」，律師們係鋻於軍人犯了普通刑事罪而每每不受普通法判罪之不合理，而提出者。</p>
<p>首都糾紛</p>
<p>所謂首都糾紛，就是首都律師公會方面的代表底產生合法或不合法之糾紛，問題發生在首都律師公會選派代表的方式上。首都的五個代表，戴修瓚。孫必仁·薛福齊。王洪江·趙文琦，係由公會理事會所推選，會員王龍·崔培均·兪熙祖律師等多人起而反對，認為未經會員大會選派乃不合法。於是，雙方在「中央日報」第一版上互相大登「啓事」，「聯合會」已經結束了，直到現在，糾紛似乎還幷未能有圓滿的解決</p>
<p>十三日該會第四次會，議決九月九日為「律師節」，幷推定出席下屆國際律師協會之代表，為徐士浩·陳耀東·何世楨·陳霆銳·胡經明五人。十四日上午選舉理監事，下午行閉幕禮。十五日該會召開第一　理事會，推選常務理事，結果，江一平·戴天球·鮑祥齡·紀淸漪·張且平·張文伯·薄籌·朱文德·王炳鈞等九人當選。</p>

<h3>葉觀雄直落三慘敗　陶冠球獲冠軍　公開網球決賽盛況空前</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市公開網球冠軍陶冠球，憑其穩健可靠極度準確之長抽短擊，昨日在顚峯狀態中以直落三擊敗本屆全運會冠軍葉觀雄，繼續保持錦標，同時亦報復全運會中敗於葉觀雄一簡之仇。比數為六—二，九—七，六—〇。雙方表演，相當精彩。靑年網球會昨宣吿客滿，座上仕女約計千人，開本屆首次盛况。賽前女子單打決賽，楊渭濱三盤勝朱芝英，蟬聯冠軍，比數三—六，六—〇，六—一。中級單打決賽，馬景榮以六—一，六—二，擊敗魏詩蓀，繼初級單打之後，獲雙重冠軍。比賽經過如</p>
<h3>陶冠球確有精彩</h3>
<p>看台觀衆，對於一個網球新人才的產生，俱寄予熱烈期望，故十九盼葉觀雄能勝，可有一個新的冠軍，於是見葉之失敗，咸予以同聲嘆惜。但陶冠球確有其特長精彩之廣，其穩健直可謂百不失一。第一盤葉觀雄傾全力取攻勢，猛抽上綱，但是結果陶以六—二大勝，天下之大勢，似已大定，已有預測為直落三者，陶冠球之可長，難破者有如此。葉觀雄旣不能憑其上網壓殺取勝，在第一盤中，錯誤累累，觸網出界之球無數。第二盤葉改變作風，屢以長抽短擊進攻，適投入陶之好處，越穩越不行，四比二佔先，被陶追成各四，再以五比四，六比五，七比六佔先，但陶冠球運得三局，九比七，結束第二盤。六比五葉佔先時，葉失去一個得盤點，波扳成各六，不勝可惜。第一盤雙方令力猛鬥，第二盤後半局，兩人都精疲力竭，陶一度有不耐煩樣子，但葉觸網出界爭不過氣來。第三盤葉無心戀戰，已表示放棄，上塲二個滑局，陶冠球連勝六局，完成直落三。、女子單打冠亞軍（右）楊渭濱（左）朱芝英（中國社攝）</p>
<h3>葉觀雄略遜一籌</h3>
<p>葉觀雄勝王文正如此吃力，難勝陶冠球早在意料，足見功夫火候，尙未到家，有待於進步者多多。以今日之陶冠球，必須有卡遜之黃金時代，許承基式之球藝，勝之乃可，速度還得要增加，上網抽擊還要深而準，壓殺擱網還要兇，中塲之球無用，落地之短球近球，祗能偶一用之，如此者直落三勝陶冠球有希望。昨日第一盤陶以四比一佔先，葉勝陶之發球，陶又連得二局，六比二勝來之易，出人意外。第二盤葉以四比二，五比四居先，第八局四比三陶發球時，葉於十五——四十竟迎失五記，造成四比四。其後數局，皆一再平等後，被陶得最後勝利，此乃無把握之徵象。成敗已矣，葉觀雄來日方長，陶冠球確有可取。</p>
<p>女子單打決賽，朱芝英姗姗來遲，上塲第一盤，相當精彩，但第二三兩盤已精力不濟，楊渭濱始終如一，確屬老將。三組成績，彙列於下：</p>
<p>中級單打決賽</p>
<p>女子單打決賽</p>
<p>高級單打決賽</p>
<h3>男女雙打　今日決賽</h3>

<h3>倉頡造字</h3>
<p>— 吳庸</p>
<p>金聖歡謂：「造字不必專於倉頡，造字必專於倉頡，然則倉頡之名不專於一人。」又謂「人人盡能製字。」荀子解蔽篇亦謂：「造字者衆矣，而倉頡獨傳。」此論至為精當。譬如史記一書：令人盡知其為漢太史公司馬遷所作，實則其採引左傳國策及其他諸古藉處頗多，司馬遷是集其大成，班固更是集其大成之大成。</p>
<p>他如印刷之起源於鈐記印韋，碑銘石刻；由碑銘之拓片而悟到印刷，這個想法上的轉彎，據估計就經過了五百年。因此眞正尋根究底起來，印刷之發明也就不能歸功於任何一人。筆墨紙張亦是如此，甚至近代之發明如電燈電話，輪船火車等等，又何嘗不如此。其中多有多人同時異地個別發明者，足見其發明為時代進展之必然結果，馬可尼如不發明電報，自會有牛可尼來出塲。此點W.F.奥本於所著「社會變遷」一書中言之甚詳，繁引博微，證據充足，令人沒法不信服。</p>
<p>又如社會制度之變革，民情風俗之轉移，均可作如是觀。他國政治之日抵於興隆，我國國是之日趨下坡，亦只是過去歷史演化之延續，其由來也漸，非一朝一夕所促成，亦非一人所能獨任其功過。語云：一將成名萬骨枯，此語是同情萬骨，獨責一將。萬骨之該同情也圃矣，然萬骨何以死心塌地，甘為之枯，遂使豎子成名？故據事理言，實亦有未是處。故於評人論事之際，我們須記取：文化是累積的，武化也是累積的。</p>
<h3>氧氣專家</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>我國工業，事事落後，固由於人材的缺乏，但人材未嘗不可由培養而來，只要當軸者極力提倡，凡是出洋留學的人，須揀歐洲國家最新最近所發明的科學從事硏究，歸國後，由政府首先擢用，積極組織最新工業，以為學成者施展本領的地盤，庶可免去「學非所用用非所學」的向來弊病，如此，國家安得不欣欣向榮。</p>
<p>我友錢士靑先生，曾為留歐學生監督，早已洞知此事，故其世兄雲生先生於丁丑歲赴英留學時，即選擇氧氣一種，極力從事硏究，於年前得有機械工程碩士，仍留英實習三年，得有化學工程博士，於氧氣部分，研究成功，可以算得我們中國研究氧氣的第一人。</p>
<p>但聞雲生於未歸國時，已接受北平淸華大學敎授之聘，固可將莫所領取的理論，灌輸到一般大學生的心內，但是國家對於這種人材，不與撥動基金，組織一氧氣化學廠，俾之發揮所學，未免可惜，</p>
<p>雲生於歸國途中，吟有四詩，寄呈乃父，頗多感慨。一云：少年豪邁氣縱橫，游遍寰球與海瀛，歐美諸邦先進國，千秋大業在民生。二云：從來有志竟能成，十載工程學研精，博士虛名今幸獲，欲圓報國尙屛營。三云；萬邦道德皆從舊，科學於今每尙新，原子縱能威四海，欲求郢治在親仁。四云：先王德澤庇雲孫，父母劬勞不勝言，樵採機聲思往昔，何年得報我親恩！</p>
<p>其尊人士靑先生，抄寄同人索和，金息侯云：海外重開陌上花，王孫緩緩賦歸槎，錦衣學作綵花舞，吳越人文第一家。兪靜齋云：十年劬學藝同尊，海外聲名動九閣，絳帳諸生相望切，羨君桃李已盈門。（返國後掌敎淸華大學。）盈庭玉樹更芝蘭，萬里歸航一笑歡，忠孝傳家源有自，堂前喜見舞衣寬。賈荆齋云：重瀛劬學歲頻更，工藝精研期起行，覓得神方能渡世，扶衰救敝挽民生。喬柯茂挺拂雲枝，雨露涵濡蒼翠奇，騷雅傳家尤傑出，趨庭携得海天詩。余亦次韻和作，不及備載</p>
<p>士靑先生題所寄肖像云：「八一三日丁丑年，滬上砲火正連天，二時停戰撤僑民，海輪停泊吳淞前，四兒冒險乘輪去，海外求學意志堅，乘風破浪行萬里，專門學術費討硏。倫敦大學甫一載，疏散人口又重遷，移校名登愛丁堡，倫敦學分不計焉。經兒首先與交涉，暫變章程請從權，疏散本遵當局意，學生不能任過愆，逾額學費　籌足，學業邦交應顧全。上書學校董士會，原有學分准補塡，留英學生多援例，兒之虛名至今傳。四載畢業入工廠，實習氣氣學新鮮，現時廠事已完畢，副工程師忝備員，千載一時好機會，求學刻能達眞筌。學貴比較分擾劣，實地考察再言旋，畢業肖像付置郵，今余見之心欣然，親友不時來相問，聊以一紙報拳拳。四兒至今未婚娶，回時始可言姻緣，出國今已有七載，國內困苦與顚連，河山依舊景全非，惟有江水尙姓錢。」述其留學時事實，，恰似白香山詩體，甚願雲生先生歸國後，將其所學發揮光大，本向來愛國之精神，贊助國家，進而入於科學化的地位，則中國不能說沒有希望吧？</p>
<h3>中秋夜對月長歌</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>老天之心胡可非？日以壯我該，月以濬我機·我有萬古感，對月輙抒揮，抒揮復抒揮，一一發其徵。天不能常晴，雲每掩月明，我為月份雲，此非我私情；浩浩莾人間，誰好夜如盲？屈指幾中秋，地怨天亦愁！怪風與自雨，若與月為仇！去年今日成虛望，今年今日樂如狂。十四夜朗朗，十五日堂堂，糖芋如拳月餅甜，萬事如意皆可忘。入夜果然月一輪，如我之願爛如銀；縱有黑雲如怪獸，旣不相犯，亦不相親，各行其是，互抱其眞，遂使下世　觸仰首民，胡帝胡天而為此夜祭月神。彩廉與香斗，　品色色陳；可憐小兒女，合黨拜頻頻。詢其何所祝？國泰民不貧。吾聞恧吾心，吾心其沉淪，但知玩其色，不知胞與仁。月其今夜臨空照，照見下界多少人！北地如何？東西如何？中原如何？吾何忍問但酸辛！月乎，月乎，汝有手，吾知有物掣其肘。汝有首，吾知但能搖右而搖左。汝有口，吾知但有呻吟而不吼！月乎，月乎，吾已疲，今年再訂明年期。長空尙有萬里程，行行且把蟾蚣騎；吾不能為汝防，吾却為汝思，風正緊，雲正痴！</p>
<h3>李根大殿撰</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>讀九月十四日「自由談」，載有吾友武宗燦「記李根大」（蟠）一文，並及美西溟。金因憶西溟曾有一詩贈根大云：「望重彭城郡，名高進士科。儀容如絳勃，刀筆似蕭何。本下還生子，蟲邊更著番。一般難學處，三十六餑餑。」根大狀貌醜陋若武人·殿試日，懷　　三十六枚，食之且盡。為諸生時，且以刀筆聞·則西溟此詩亦謔而且虐矣。根大西溟均以科塲案而遭凶終，抑亦其平生無行之顯報　？世俗每以狀元皆當翩翩玉貌，根大貌不及中人，文才又不敏捷，其受譏於俗人也固宜。西溟則老名士，且又與根火同科，乃亦對之作惡謔；則不無因嫉而生忌，因忌而報以惡聲也。是亦文人無行之尤者矣。根大無著作傳世，今日尙有知其名氏者，徒以醜貌醜行而已。奇哉！</p>
<h3>怪賊</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>美國愛達荷州河河邊某鎭的鎭長辦事處最近受理了一件竊案，被竊的東西是河上荒僻處的一座鋼橋，重達廿噸，長達四十呎。公路當局因此橋毫無實用，所以派員調查，想把它移往他處，不想到那處一看，竟然業已失竊了。</p>
<p>伊利諾愛州阿爾貢金城，居民品性優良，警察局竟然多日淸閑無事，因此警察當局大表欣慰，特地設宴招待全體警員。不想正在他們興高采烈地共慶昇平之際，却有人倫偷溜進了警察局，偸去手槍兩支，子彈三盒，警員證章十枚——連監獄大門的鑰匙也順手牽羊的拿了去。</p>
<p>巴爾的摩有一人報警，說是他失竊了一只上好警犬，據他說那只警犬最善捉賊，失竊時正在守門云。</p>
<p>米希根州一居民，名呌克拉克，一天返家時，突在汽車間中發見一個小偸，正在偸他的修理汽車的工具·克拉克大怒，不禁破口大駡，奔上去想飽以老拳，那個小賊一看不好，連忙逃走。克拉克追趕不及，回轉身來整理這些差一點被偸的東西，整理了半個鐘頭，抬頭一看，那個小賊倒又在面前了，但見他面目猙獰，拿出手槍，嚇得克拉克而如土色·那個小賊重新動手，把那些修車工具中最好的幾件放在袋中，再走上前把克拉克身邊的兩百七十三塊美金拿走，臨行時還說：「以後你總不會開口就駡人了罷？」</p>
<h3>玉山烟雨</h3>
<p>— 陸清照</p>
<p>玉山又名馬鞍山，是崑山名勝之一，位於縣城之北，景色秀麗，頗負聲譽，每年春秋二季，遊人絡繹不絕。你如果坐京滬路的火車經過崑山車站的時候，探首張望，便隱約可見。</p>
<p>我遠離鄕井已有十餘年了，此番歸來，見玉山如見故人，於是偸得浮生半日閑，鼓與登臨，盡情遊覽。時候雖然已屬新秋，可是天氣還頗有夏意。當我步至半山時，忽而陰雲四合，下起雨來了。誠恐雨越下越大，遂帶緊脚步，趕上山巔，徘徊在寺舍的走廊裏，四顧寂然，別有一番冷靜的滋味。　欄靜觀那籠罩在烟雨中的山景，活像一幅畫，但覺濃淡宜人，美不勝收。</p>
<p>這時候，整個的山峯塗上淡黃淺碧的顏色。裊裊遊雲，自下而上，由白而灰，在空中冉冉飄蕩。極目無際，雲樹蒼茫，很像一個浩瀚無涯的霧海。浮雲吹過樹梢，隨風招展，散向遠方。密集的雨點，擊着鐵質的圍攔，發出一聲聲鳴環般的回響。一陣風吹過綠竹，互相攻迸出裂帛似的聲浪。於是像碎玉戞金的雨聲竹聲，加入了濃淡入畫的山色天色。</p>
<p>玉山多少帶一點人為的點綴，但一經山雨洗刷，則恰如滌盡了奢侈的鉛華，還到了淸白的本色。</p>
<p>烟雨迷濛，林　　忽，眞有無可言喻的美。當我下山的時候，回首望那山頭玲瓏的小塔，在雲海裏若隱隱若現，有如少女的面上蒙了一層輕紗，使遊客格外的低徊不盡·我竟於無意中見之，也可以說是有綠了。</p>
<h3>我國石刻藝術</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>中國藝術最偉大的一種，舉世認為具有世界文化史價値的，便是石刻。翻開任何一種講述中國藝術的書籍，中國石刻總是佔着最光輝的一頁。</p>
<p>第一，因為石刻遺品時代之久遠，為我國藝術之冠。中國的建築非不偉大，中國的繪畫非不壯麗，但是漢代建築久已化為灰燼，六朝唐代的繪畫僅存敦煌石室的壁畫，而漢代石刻則道存甚多，甚至商代石刻像，不久之前在安陽的地下也發掘了出來。其次，石刻工程之偉大簡直莫與比倫，卽如河南洛陽龍門山最初經營石窟三座，費時二十五年，費工八十萬二千三百六十六工，而山四大同雲崗石窟佛像，且數十倍於龍門，其工程如何可驚，　難想像。其次，石刻藝術之豐富與優良以及題材之衆多，亦為任何我國藝術所望塵莫及。石刻之雕琢與裝飾，實集中外雕刻之大成，有中國本色，有印度式，有希臘式，均可於各地的各種石刻見之。至石刻題材之廣博，則有中國最古的神話，戰史，宗敎以及其他種種史蹟。石刻藝術的普遍及悠久也佔我國藹術餌域的尖端，古代石刻發見於山東山西河南四川各地，其就近者則卽如上海浦東陸深墳墓上也尙留有石刻人為；而石刻藝術家在今日蘇州仍可找到一二名匠·此種石刻大匠雖則沒有表明是雕刻家的頭銜，但的確靠了他們才維繫了我們中國數千年來的雕刻藝術。</p>
<p>中國石刻遺品能够如此豐富，其故有二：一為從漢代以來的厚葬風俗始終沒有中斷過，二為佛敎宣傳的普及。前者保存了山東四川等地漢墓石刻，後者保存了河南山西等的佛窟。</p>
<p>我國石刻從雕刻方法上分類，大略可分為兩類：一種是立體的，就是石人石馬，石獅之類，一種是平面的，就是碑石之類。碑石一類的雕刻，有的是陰刻的，有的是陽刻的，可以稱之為浮雕。</p>
<p>我國素來注重金石之學，但是太偏重於文字方面，因之立體石刻之人物，平面雕刻之圖象反被疏忽。從來的金石書籍縱有記述石刻圖象也極疏漏，不加重視。要研究我國這種最偉大的石刻藝術，所以現在還是最好的機會。此次上海美術館籌備處舉辦我國雕塑藝術展覽會，那是勝利後對於石刻藝術宣揚的第一聲，實在値得讚許。所惜展覽塲所不够陳列大塊的畫石，也無足够的牆壁可以懸掛巨大豐富的石刻拓片；此次所出品的石刻拓片，僅取一個人蒐藏品中百分之一二，眞是給參觀者「聊嘗一　」而已。</p>

<h3>City Council Approves Sending Telegram of Support to Jinan Garrison</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan, in its morning session on the 21st, unanimously passed a provisional motion proposed by committee members Kong Lingcan and 47 others. The resolution was to send a telegram in the name of the Yuan to express condolences and support to Wang Yaowu, commander of the Second Pacification Zone, and all the officers and men firmly defending Jinan. Simultaneously, the Yuan will request the Executive Yuan to quickly dispatch a large army for reinforcements to boost morale, annihilate the bandit hordes, and secure the famous city.</p>
<h3>Situation in Jinan Remains Stable; Bandit Plainclothesmen Invading Commercial District Cleared; Powerful Air Force Intensifies Extensive Reconnaissance and Bombing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Wang Yaowu, at 4:00 PM on the 21st, communicated by telephone with his office in Nanjing, reporting that the situation in Jinan was stable and that the plainclothes bandit squads and the Wu Huawen rebel troops who had infiltrated the commercial district had been cleared out by the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the situation in Jinan, as currently known in Nanjing, Wu Huawen's troops were originally stationed to defend the Jinan commercial district. After Wu's defection, bandit forces immediately infiltrated the urban area. The essence of Jinan lies entirely in the commercial district. The unexpected change occurred amidst chaos. Wang Yaowu's headquarters, originally in the commercial district, had been preemptively moved into the city. Important materials and telecommunications equipment had also been moved into the city. After Wu's defection, Wang defended the city. The fighting has extended to the northern part of the city and the area around the commercial district's railway station. The radio stations of general news and communication organizations have been disconnected since the 21st, and telegram services from the telecommunications bureau were also interrupted on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announced that fierce fighting continued yesterday on the outskirts of Jinan. The bandits launched repeated attacks, all of which were thwarted by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 21st] In the battles on the outskirts of Jinan, the bandits have suffered heavy casualties in the past six days and are now desperately gathering reinforcements, attempting to attack again. The bandit Bohai Column and the New Eleventh Column (reorganized from the local communist Cui Ziming's troops) are still engaged in combat with our defending troops at Wangsherenzhuang. Bandit forces attacking Wangsherenzhuang have been found to have tanks participating in the battle, which may be part of the bandit's rapid support force rushing to reinforce. The Chen bandit's 2nd and 12th Columns, which fled from northern Jiangsu to the south of Feixian, are currently gradually moving towards Tai'an. Local bandits near Feixian have also been actively requisitioning grain and laborers to transport to Zouxian. The Liu bandit's Eleventh Column in western Shandong moved south from Duncunji on the 19th to the vicinity of Caomaji (between Yutai and Shanxian). A large number of bandit stretcher-bearers and transport teams in northern Shandong are currently fleeing south from various ferries near Qiji (north of Zouping). Our powerful air force is intensifying extensive reconnaissance and bombing of the bandit forces in transit.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 21st] The Chen bandit's 2nd and 12th Columns, located in the area of Zhu Chen Fujiagang southwest of Linyi, fled to Feixian yesterday.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Improve the Treatment of Public and Educational Personnel; Legislative Yuan Passes for Review; Also Requests the Government to Restrict Excessive Land Requisition; Secret Meeting to Be Held the Day After Tomorrow to Hear Diplomatic and Military Reports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Legislative Yuan's fourth meeting of the second session was held on the morning of the 21st, chaired by Vice President Chen Lifu. After passing the minutes of the third meeting, discussions began. The first case was the report of the Land Administration Committee reviewing the proposal by Chen Cheng and others requesting the government to promptly clear the outstanding payments for land already requisitioned and to clear its taxes, and to restrict further excessive land requisition and suppression of land prices, in order to protect the rights and interests of the people. The decision was to pass it according to the review opinions. The second case was the review committee's report on the case of reviewing the gains and losses of national governance since the victory, proposing to form a special committee, divided into five groups: political, economic, military, diplomatic, and institutional, for long-term review. The decision was to abolish the entire case, and the review work will be carried out separately by each standing committee. The third and fourth cases were two cases proposed by Yu Lingyun and Xie Chengyu, respectively, regarding improving the treatment of public and educational personnel. After combined discussion, the decision was to merge them and submit them to the budget and financial committees for joint review. The fifth case was the proposal by Xie Chengyu and others to improve the purchase and sale of foreign currency from overseas Chinese, facilitating the return to the country and the return to the place of residence of overseas Chinese. The decision was to submit it to the financial, diplomatic, and overseas Chinese committees for joint review. The sixth case was the proposal by Cheng Tianfang and others to request the Executive Yuan to promptly submit the changed tax rates to the Legislative Yuan for review in order to complete the legislative process. The decision was to submit it to the legal and financial committees for joint review.

After the proposer explained, the committee members continued to speak enthusiastically. Except for a few committee members who held completely opposing views, most committee members agreed in principle on the ideal of realizing "those who cultivate the land own it," achieving social revolution and economic equality in a non-bloody way. They also put forward supplementary and revised opinions on the proposal, advocating that it be submitted for review first. By 6:00 PM, about ten committee members had spoken, and 25 were waiting to speak. They believed that this case was of great importance and should be discussed at length, and considered that it should be postponed to the next regular meeting for continued discussion. The meeting agreed, and this case was temporarily suspended. Then, two provisional motions were passed, one proposed by Liu Bokun and 30 others, requesting the Premier of the Executive Yuan to report to the Yuan on the policies adopted by our government on the various agendas of the third session of the United Nations General Assembly, and the other proposed by Du Guangxun and 27 others, requesting the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of National Defense, and the Chief of Staff to report to the Yuan on the Jinan war situation and prepare for inquiries. Both cases were passed unanimously. It was also decided that before the fifth regular meeting on the 24th, a secret meeting would be held first, inviting officials from the Executive Yuan to attend, report on the above two matters, and answer inquiries. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Issuance of Stocks of State-Owned Enterprises; Giving the People Investment Opportunities; Finance Minister Wang Says the Proportion of Commercial Shares Can Be Considered for Increase in the Future</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Before leaving Nanjing, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu made a statement, saying: Regarding the issuance of stocks of state-owned enterprises, it has now begun to be handled in Shanghai. Because this is a pioneering undertaking, the general public's understanding of the content of the issuance methods and the government's intentions may not be clear enough. He is willing to explain this slightly for the reference of the people when investing in the purchase. It has been found that the state-owned enterprises issuing stocks this time include the China Textile Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Taiwan Paper Corporation, and Tianjin Pulp Company, all of which are currently the best-equipped, best-operated, and most promising production or construction enterprises under government management. In order to induce and assist private capital to obtain proper development, the government has specially sold a portion of the stocks of the above five units separately, giving the people a most favorable opportunity to participate in investment. Therefore, the issuance of stocks is actually for the common interests of both the government and the people. The total amount of the issued shares is strictly calculated according to the lowest estimate of its total assets, totaling 1.753 billion Gold Yuan, which is actually much lower than the current market price of each enterprise. Moreover, the equity portion retained by the government must be transferred to the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee for safekeeping and used as a Gold Yuan issuance reserve. The committee will assess whether the stock value is commensurate with the face value and will not allow overvaluation. The publicly issued portion is 564 million Gold Yuan, accounting for about one-third of the total. Compared with the general joint state-private banks or factories and mines in the past, this proportion is not small. Moreover, according to the government's decision, a shareholders' meeting can be convened as soon as one-tenth of the commercial shares are subscribed. Regarding the administrative management of the company, shareholders can make claims at the meeting, and the elected directors and supervisors can participate in the actual guiding work. How the company will be operated in the future should also be strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. Therefore, the government has fully considered the valuation of the company's assets, the proportion of equity allocation, and the legitimate rights and interests of commercial shares. In the future, the government will also consider increasing the proportion of commercial shares and increasing the number of issues, so that the people have the opportunity and power to legally control the companies and gradually move towards the path of complete private operation.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Assists Our Efforts to Stabilize the New Currency; Prohibits Money Changers from Unauthorized Buying and Selling of Gold Yuan; Finance Minister Wang Flies to the U.S. Today, Denies He Will Negotiate Currency Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] The Hong Kong government has formally notified all 141 large and small silver firms in Hong Kong that, with the exception of 23 designated banks such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Standard Chartered, and HSBC, which are permitted to directly conduct official exchange rates with designated mainland banks of the Chinese government, all others are prohibited from directly conducting Gold Yuan business with mainland China. Passengers arriving in or leaving Hong Kong carrying ornamental gold exceeding 20 Gold Yuan will be confiscated and prosecuted.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] In order to help China stabilize the new currency system, the Hong Kong government has recently issued an order that only banks authorized by the Hong Kong government to operate in foreign exchange are allowed to conduct buying and selling of Gold Yuan drafts and telegraphic transfers with designated banks of the Chinese government according to the official exchange rate of the designated banks.

<p>According to a French News Agency report from Hong Kong, officials announced that the buying and selling of Gold Yuan between Hong Kong and Macau and any other foreign countries is prohibited.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Nanjing. He will take a Northwest Airlines flight to the U.S. at 8:20 AM today to attend the third annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Xi Demao, Zhang Yuelian, and others will accompany him. It is reported that Finance Minister Wang will stay in the U.S. for about ten days. Mr. Wang said when meeting with reporters that the bandit's propaganda about the inflation of the Gold Yuan is completely unfounded. According to statistics at the end of last month, the amount of Gold Yuan issued was only 290 million Yuan, half of which was spent on the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The 5-jiao silver auxiliary coins and the 1-fen copper auxiliary coins will be circulated and issued in large quantities starting next month. The government has sufficient preparations in three aspects to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan: (1) Full reserve, limit issuance, (2) Balance of income and expenditure, (3) Stabilize prices. In the future, it is also hoped that the Hong Kong government can cooperate closely with our country to crack down on smuggling in South China.</p>
<p>The management work in Shanghai is very satisfactory, and the control work in Guangzhou is also being improved. Regarding the rumors that this trip will negotiate currency loans, Finance Minister Wang denied it.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Diligence and Thrift Movement and National Responsibility</h3>
<p>Since the President's broadcast speech on the evening of the 15th of this month, calling for a movement to build the country through diligence and thrift, people from all over have responded enthusiastically, believing that this is indeed a necessary measure to cooperate with the economic emergency decree. Because the soundness of a society's economy is based on two principles: increasing production and economizing consumption. Diligence is a key factor in actively increasing production, and thrift is essential for passively preserving it. Therefore, all economic reforms can only be truly thorough if these two words, diligence and thrift, are put into practice. Everything else is just a technical detail.</p>
<p>Anyone with a little self-respect generally knows that supporting oneself is a necessary condition for living in the world. As for those who rely on others for a living, the completely dependent, even women and the disabled, often consider it shameful. Therefore, the principle of "each doing their best and each taking what they need" is easily understood by most people. However, the most deeply ingrained and harmful common malady lies in the group that shuns labor and prefers leisure, all tending towards the division of profits. In other words, they are those who avoid production, do not engage in honest work, and only know how to use every means to pick up scraps left by others, or even to seize by trickery and force, enriching themselves at the expense of others.</p>
<p>Speaking of diligence, these people who do not engage in honest work but seize by trickery and force are not necessarily not working hard. Some even violate prohibitions and laws, take risks, and are willing to stake their lives on a single throw. For example, unscrupulous merchants who specialize in speculation and manipulation, how is their dedication and hard work any less than that of ordinary honest farmers, industrialists, and businessmen? However, it is these people who disrupt the market, and it is these people who destroy the economy. It can be seen that the meaning of the word "diligence" refers specifically to all legitimate occupations and formal duties, and not all diligence is worth promoting and praising.</p>
<p>Thrift is also a virtue, but the scope of its application varies greatly between public and private matters. For example, when manufacturing an item, even though domestic raw materials are available, imported goods are preferred in order to cater to current trends and increase profits. Also, when purchasing a tool or product, domestic goods are avoided and foreign goods are sought because they are cheaper or of better quality. From the individual's perspective, this may be considered thrift, but from the perspective of the overall national economy, it is a great waste.</p>
<p>For this reason, we believe that the value of diligence and thrift should not be measured solely from an individual's point of view, but should be judged from the standpoint of society or the nation. Only those who truly contribute to the national economy and people's livelihood can be praised for their commendable diligence and thrift. This is what should be given priority when promoting the diligence and thrift movement today. If viewed from the perspective of those speculative merchants who are very energetic, as mentioned above, and those users of foreign goods who only know how to seek profit, although they may be given the title of diligence and thrift in a certain sense, they certainly cannot be said to be building the country. Rather, the foundation of the national economy is being destroyed by these selfish and self-serving people.</p>
<p>In our previous article, "Responding to the Diligence and Thrift Movement to Build the Country," we said that in order for this movement to quickly achieve results, it is necessary for contemporary dignitaries to promote it. This was originally meant for them to lead by example, not just to preside over it. Although the effects of promoting diligence and thrift are mostly of economic significance, the nature of this movement is social and educational, not economic or political. The President said: "The way to promote it is to practice it personally, and for everyone to show a style of diligence and thrift in their daily lives." What a broad movement this is! If every citizen does not apply this principle to every corner of their daily lives, then its purpose will not be thoroughly implemented, and its effects will not be very significant. Therefore, the President did not initiate this movement as the head of national politics, but specifically promoted it as a member of the public, making it clear that this is a social reform movement, and that all levels of society should jointly undertake it and participate in it. It is absolutely not possible to entrust this responsibility entirely to a few people. Experience tells us that this kind of mission to change customs and habits will not have very good results if it does not have the foundation of everyone's self-awareness and self-discipline, and relies solely on political power to promote it. Putting aside other things, isn't the past "such and such" movement a very obvious example? However, the purpose of this diligence and thrift movement to build the country is to cooperate with the new economic measures; at the same time, it is also to cooperate with the fundamental work of suppressing the rebellion. It is the same as only allowing success and not allowing failure. Therefore, on the one hand, we want the general dignitaries to be proactive and self-aware, to practice it personally, and to set an example and lead. On the other hand, we still hope that people from all walks of life will become enlightened and actively participate together.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Adjusting Capital: Ministry of Finance Sets Procedures to be Completed Within Two Months Starting from the 6th of This Month</h3>

It is learned that, in order to standardize the procedures for commercial banks to adjust capital and to achieve quick results, the Ministry of Finance has separately formulated a "Procedure for Commercial Banks to Adjust Capital," which is to be followed by all banks. The original text of the procedure is excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) All banks should complete the capital adjustment procedures within two months from September 6th, 37th year of the Republic [1948], the date the government promulgated the "Measures for Commercial Banks to Adjust Capital."</p>
<p>(2) All banks should first convene a general meeting of shareholders in accordance with the relevant provisions on capital increase in Articles 41, 114, 246, 247, 251, 253, 254, 255, and 256 of the Company Law to discuss the capital increase plan. The valuation of existing assets should be handled in accordance with the capital adjustment measures.</p>
<p>(3) The original capital amount of all banks, after being verified as required, can be converted into gold yuan and regarded as part of the capital. No further verification is required.</p>
<p>(4) After the shareholders' meeting approves the capital increase plan, the new capital should be raised immediately, and a "Report Form for Commercial Banks to Adjust Capital" should be filled out in five copies. Two copies, along with the documents and fees required for the capital increase, should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. Two copies, along with the cash for the capital increase, should be sent to the local Central Bank or its entrusted bank for inspection. The remaining copy should be kept for reference.</p>
<p>(5) After receiving the aforementioned report form, the Ministry of Finance will review it. If the reported information is consistent with the regulations, it will immediately send one copy of the original report form to the local Central Bank or its entrusted bank to verify whether the capital is consistent, whether the assets are genuine, and whether the valuation is accurate.</p>
<p>(6) If the local Central Bank or its entrusted bank verifies that the assets and capital are genuine and there is no ambiguity, it will issue a capital verification certificate after the original applying bank issues a guarantee. The original report form will be signed and sealed by the responsible personnel of the inspection bank, and sent to the Ministry of Finance for review along with the guarantee and balance sheet. The cash deposited for the capital increase will be returned to the original depositing bank after three months.</p>
<p>(7) After receiving the aforementioned capital verification report form from the Central Bank or its entrusted bank, if the Ministry of Finance finds no discrepancies, it will approve the change of business registration.</p>

<h3>Expanding the Trade System with Japan: In Addition to Barter, Japan Can Order with Cash: Trade 指会 (zhǐ huì, unclear, potentially, "Guidance Conference") with Japan to Reconvene on Friday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The trade system with Japan is about to undergo new changes. The government originally stipulated that trade with Japan could only be conducted on the basis of barter, but it has now been decided to adopt a cash system in addition to barter. This expansion of the trade system with Japan will be formally decided at the Trade Guidance Committee with Japan to be held this Friday (24th) afternoon. The meeting has been suspended for a long time. This reconvening is specifically to discuss the expanded system of trade with Japan. Two decisions will be made at the meeting: (1) A cash system can be adopted for trade with Japan. Japan can purchase our country's materials and goods with cash, but our country will still adopt barter when purchasing Japanese goods. (2) Chinese private merchants can enter into contracts with Japanese private merchants, provided that the contracts are signed by the trade group of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan and the Japanese Trade Agency. The Chinese delegation stationed in Japan recently sent a message to our Ministry of Industry and Commerce, informing them that Japan will purchase our goods with cash and that the Allied Headquarters has approved it. The Japanese Trade Agency intends to order 2 million US dollars worth of gallnuts, raw lacquer, wheat bran, vegetable seeds, sesame seeds, fat, food, etc. from our country. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will submit this matter for discussion at the Trade Guidance Committee with Japan on the 24th, and it can also be decided at the same time as the issue of expanding the trade system with Japan.</p>

He elaborated in detail on the significance of the Ministry of Food's convening of a meeting on reducing the precision of rice and flour processing in order to respond to the President's advocacy of the diligence and thrift movement to build the country, and made some cautionary remarks on the severity of the current food shortage in various regions and the comparison of general food waste. It was explained that the Ministry of Food has decided to continue to strengthen the implementation of food conservation in various regions, and to focus on banning brewing and reducing the precision of rice and flour processing. In addition to the separate discussion on banning brewing, it is urgent to effectively reduce the precision of rice and flour processing, which can simultaneously achieve the effects of increasing production and economizing consumption. The total output of rice and flour nationwide can be increased, and brown rice and coarse noodles can also reduce the cost of people's purchases, and it is just enough to help people's nutrition and health, so it was decided to jointly study effective methods to complete this policy. Subsequently, the proposal drafted by the Ministry of Food was discussed in detail. The standard for the yield of rice and flour processing is to increase it by 10% compared to the current situation, so as to increase the amount of production, and the prices of rice and flour will also be reduced by about 10% compared to the current prices, in order to reduce the burden on the people. Various detailed decisions have been made and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Food for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3>Total Amount of Gold and Silver Converted Nationwide Reaches Approximately US$140 Million; Possession of Gold and Silver Will Be Considered a Crime Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Since the currency reform, the results of gold, silver, and foreign currency conversion in various regions have been very good. According to preliminary estimates, from August 23rd to September 18th, the total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency converted is equivalent to over US$139,130,000. The number of conversions in the fourth week was the highest, reaching over US$63 million. The conversion period has been set to end this month.

Hundreds of millions of people who hope to preserve their country, freedom, life, and property without fear of future troubles are worried about losing this precious opportunity for peace." Auriol also stated: "Today's peace rests on your strength, that is, the material strength embodied in the UN Charter and the spiritual strength endowed by humanity."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 21st Broadcast: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt was elected President of the UN General Assembly with 31 votes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] Facing a complete breakdown in relations between the East and West blocs over the Berlin and German questions, the United Nations General Assembly opened at 3:00 PM (Paris time) today in the modern streamlined hall of the Palais de Chaillot, attended by representatives from 58 member states. Temporary Chairman, Argentine representative Dr. Bramuglia, delivered the opening remarks. In front of the leaders presiding over the East-West Cold War, Dr. Bramuglia revealed the fact that "We are facing a new and terrible man-made conflict." He appealed to all countries, requesting that they "abandon violence," and relinquish all thoughts tending towards war under the major premise of rebuilding peace. Bramuglia was clearly preoccupied with the Berlin issue, stating: "Resorting to war in the end due to failure to reach an agreement can neither be a target of hope nor a target of despair." He continued: "Any force within any nation that has influence must guide it away from the direction of stimulating war power. Humanity should try to work for peace, which is exactly what all human beings in the world hope for." Finally, Bramuglia concluded his speech solemnly, stating: "I ask you to reflect; I ask you to move towards peace."</p>

<h3>Moscow Talks Have Failed, Three Foreign Ministers Consult Frequently, Three Ambassadors to the Soviet Union Summoned to Paris, Whether Berlin Question Will Be Submitted to the UN General Assembly Still Undecided</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The Western Big Three ambassadors to Moscow are expected to arrive here today to participate in the second meeting of the three foreign ministers at the French Foreign Ministry at 6:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] Western Big Three representatives to the Soviet Union, Roberts, Smith, and Chataigneau, flew to Paris from here this morning. Before boarding the plane to leave Moscow, French Ambassador Chataigneau announced that he would stay in Paris for a short time to consult with French Foreign Minister Schuman, and then return to Moscow. British Envoy Roberts also issued a similar statement, saying that British Foreign Secretary Bevin wanted to know about the situation in the Moscow talks. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith did not make any statement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 20th, Associated Press] The British, American, and French ambassadors to Moscow have all been summoned to Paris for consultations with their foreign ministers. Their seven-week talks with Molotov on the Berlin crisis have concluded, and the attempt to break the deadlock can be said to have completely failed. The general situation in Berlin and Germany must now be discussed by Marshall, Bevin, and Schuman with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who is the Soviet Union's chief representative attending the UN General Assembly in Paris.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] If the Western Big Three foreign ministers decide to formally put the Berlin question on the agenda of the General Assembly or the Security Council, the Soviet Union will definitely argue that the Berlin and German questions are within the jurisdiction of the Four Powers, while the Big Three will strongly assert that all efforts to reach an agreement have failed and the Soviet blockade has not been lifted. The Western Big Three have not yet decided whether to bring the Berlin question before the General Assembly or the Security Council. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. In the Security Council, the Soviet Union has veto power, and the Soviet Union may again walk out of the meeting like it did during the debate on the Iranian question in 1946. However, not putting the Berlin question on the General Assembly's agenda to avoid a deadlock between East and West may give the General Assembly more time to deal with other issues, and the chances of resolving it may be better.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 20th] Marshall, Bevin, and Schuman met for an hour at the French Foreign Ministry today to hold preliminary talks on the Berlin crisis. It is said that this meeting confirmed that the Moscow negotiation stage of the Berlin issue has come to an end. Other important issues at the UN General Assembly are also shrouded in the shadow of the East-West crisis. The three foreign ministers and the senior aides who participated in the evening meeting did not show a trace of a smile. Accompanying Marshall were Republican foreign policy expert Dulles, who may serve as US Secretary of State under Dewey, State Department advisor Bohlen, Ambassador to the UK Douglas, and Ambassador to France Caffery.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] US Commander-in-Chief of the American Zone of Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, flew to Paris on the evening of the 20th to meet with Secretary of State Marshall. The UN General Assembly opened in Paris on the 21st. Pictured: French Foreign Minister Schuman (right) hands a gold key to UN Secretary-General Lie, which explains that the Palais de Chaillot, where the meeting is held, is not within French territory, and representatives of various countries in the palace enjoy extraterritoriality.

<h3>Soviet Union Launches Another Propaganda Offensive, Demands Allied Forces Withdraw from Germany</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: The Soviet Army Official Gazette in Berlin stated: The Soviet Union demands that all occupying troops stationed in Germany and Berlin immediately withdraw. The newspaper compared Germany to Korea, urging Germans to pay attention to the actions taken by the Soviet Union in Korea, that is, preparing to completely withdraw Soviet troops from Korea before the end of this year. Washington officials believe that this Soviet demand is a kind of propaganda offensive to win the sympathy of the Germans.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 21st] Observers commenting on the Soviet occupation forces' newspaper's demand that all occupying forces withdraw from Germany said that the Soviet demand is based on its firm belief that once the Western Allied forces withdraw from Berlin, the Communist action teams and Soviet-trained German national army will be able to easily occupy Berlin. According to recent German newspaper reports, armed German Communist action teams are being formed in Soviet-controlled factories. Similar groups will immediately begin to be organized in factories in Berlin. Observers also believe that the timing of the Soviet demand coincides with the opening of the UN General Assembly in Paris. If the Soviet Union cannot prevent the United Nations from discussing the Berlin crisis, it will obviously propose a solution, that is, the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from Berlin by the Four Powers.</p>
<h3>Communist Rebellion Is Purely Indonesia's Internal Affair, No Interference by the Netherlands Is Permitted, Indonesian Government Rejects Dutch Joint Anti-Communist Proposal</h3>

The Dutch proposal for a joint Dutch-Indonesian resistance to communism was proposed by Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker in Washington, as reported by various newspapers here.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Government and Communists Have Not Officially Opened Fire, Government Announces It Has Been Able to Control the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 20th] The Madiun Communist-controlled radio station announced on the 20th: "The Soviet Republic of Java" has been established, with Moscow-trained communist Muso as chairman.

The missions of Belgium, Australia, and Italy were originally scheduled to stay in the Indonesian area for three months. It is also reported that fierce fighting has broken out between Indonesia and the Netherlands in central Java. The communist-controlled Madiun radio station accused the Republic of Indonesia of pursuing a policy of surrendering to the Netherlands and Britain, and selling Indonesia to American capitalists. The radio broadcast combined with the orders of the communist government, ordering the guards to be stationed in the main buildings in the city. Forty-eight hours have passed since the communists launched the coup, but no news of war between the Republic and the Communists has been received.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 21st] The Indonesian Republican government said on the 21st that military authorities had prevented unrest by the Communists in Semarang.

Finally, the broadcast said: The government has been able to control the entire situation.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker announced on the 20th that he plans to invite Indonesian Prime Minister Hatta to "renegotiate" and "redeploy" the joint Dutch-Indonesian suppression of communists and to resolve the future political system of Indonesia. Stikker told reporters that if Prime Minister Hatta is willing, the new Dutch cabinet is willing to support the current renegotiation. The Dutch cabinet has decided to recognize the legitimate hopes of true nationalists for independence and freedom. But we reject any negotiations that may strengthen communist action.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] It is generally believed that the promotion of Lieutenant General LeMay, Commander of the US Air Force in Europe, to Commander of the Air Force Strategic Command is an implication warning to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is well aware that General LeMay is the person who presided over the Berlin airlift for the past three months, breaking the Soviet blockade.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] US Far East Air Force Headquarters recently announced: Major General Whyte has been relieved of his duties as commander of the 5th Air Force and has returned to the United States to take up a position at the US Air Force Headquarters in Washington.

<h3>For Harboring Greek Guerrillas, Britain, America, and France Protest to Albania</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The governments of the United States, France, and Britain have protested to Albania for allowing Greek guerrillas to launch attacks on the Greek government forces from Albanian territory.

<h3>Former Chief of the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Yamin, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Crime: "Extorting Merchants and Engaging in Stock Trading"; Before Death, He Pleaded to Speak, Repeatedly Saying He Was "Sacrificed"</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhang Yamin, the former chief of the Economic Section of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was escorted to Nanjing for interrogation in July this year due to a corruption case. He was sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and the sentence was approved by the highest authorities. He was returned to Shanghai for execution. Zhang was picked up by the Garrison Headquarters in Shanghai at 8:50 p.m. the day before yesterday, and was temporarily detained in the detention center of the Garrison Headquarters' Military Law Department that night. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Zeng Zhaoyi, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters, personally signed for Zhang, verified his identity, and escorted him to the Jiangwan execution ground for execution by firing squad at 3:45 p.m.</p>
<p>After Zhang Yamin was placed in the detention center, the Garrison Headquarters prohibited him from meeting with any relatives or family members. Therefore, Zhang did not know that his death was imminent until the jailer opened his shackles at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday. He immediately asked for paper and pen to write his will. At 3:00 p.m., Chief Zeng of the Military Law Department personally went to the detention center and set up a table to bring Zhang out of prison. Zhang looked slightly thinner after two months of imprisonment. He wore a white-bottomed blue-striped pajama suit and yellow leather shoes, with his demeanor as before. Chief Zeng inquired about his name, age, and ancestral origin, and informed him that he was ordered to be executed today. At this time, Zhang's nerves suddenly became tense. He asked to speak, saying, "I worked for the benefit of the five million citizens of Shanghai, but now I am being sacrificed and not understood by the five million citizens." He seemed to feel extremely wronged. He also said, "I am a sacrifice in the struggle for power and profit." In order to reduce his pain before execution, the court staff persuaded him to drink a large bowl of sorghum wine and injected him with an anesthetic. After Chief Zeng finished writing the execution order, he was escorted by soldiers of the Special Service Company and military police onto an execution vehicle and driven to the Jiangwan execution ground. When the vehicle arrived at the execution ground, Zhang had already lost consciousness. He was supported off the vehicle by the military police and laid face down on the ground. Tang Shaowu, the squad leader of the Special Service Platoon, aimed and fired a rifle. One shot was fatal, the bullet entering from the back and exiting from the front chest.</p>
<p>Will to Wife</p>
<p>The full text of Zhang's will to his wife is as follows: "Min: I have sacrificed myself for the sake of the lives of five million citizens of Shanghai. The rumors of treacherous merchants and the harsh environment have overwhelmed me like a torrent. My strength alone is too small to fight against the evil forces, but my heart is honest. I hope you cherish your Mao Mao (Zhang's daughter) and educate her well to become a great woman, leading humanity towards goodness and love. Take good care of my foolish old mother and weak younger sister. I will be grateful even in the afterlife. If there are problems with living expenses in the future, you can only borrow from relatives and friends. I only have a reputation for making money, but no real ability to make money for you to live on. I leave behind a watch, a fountain pen, and a ballpoint pen as parting mementos, as well as two photos. Please return them to Hui (Zhang Yamin's lover) so that there will be one more person in the world who understands me. There are also several poems I wrote in prison, which can also be left for the world to see. Farewell, life is like a dream. I didn't expect my dream to be so short, but death is inevitable. I also didn't expect my death to be so misunderstood. You don't have to be too sad. If you can forget, it's best to forget. Finally, I hope you are always happy, and I hope my soul can go to a fearless world, where I can often meet you in dreams. Farewell! Goodbye forever, I wish you peace and happiness. Written by Yamin on July 21st at 3:30 p.m."</p>

The head and deputy head of the delegation, Zhang Fang and Xie Renzhao, met with the President on the 20th to report, and then took a car back to Shanghai. According to their impressions of this trip: 1. The situation in Central China is stable. Our army has changed from defense to offense, and we are confident of victory. The bandits have no chance to attack again. 2. The officers and soldiers were inspired by the comfort from all sectors of Shanghai. Zhang Changfa, a soldier representative from a certain unit in Suxian, said that he hoped to bring the flames of war and the bloody atmosphere back to the rear so that the people of Shanghai would no longer live in a dream and fight alongside them. 3. The distance between the front and the rear is too far.

<h3>Resolving the Meat Shortage, Three Points Agreed Upon; Wholesale Prices May Be Adjusted Appropriately; Retail Prices Absolutely Must Not Exceed the Limit</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Social Bureau, Finance Bureau, Health Bureau, and Police Bureau convened representatives from the Fresh Meat, Pig Trade, and Fresh Pork industries at the bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and agreed on the following: (1) Slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to be used for trading. A public notice will be jointly issued by the Social and Police Bureaus, and the Police Bureau will send personnel to supervise regularly. (2) In the event of a shortage of supply, the wholesale price of meat is allowed to be adjusted, provided that the retail price remains unchanged, to 7.4 jiao per kilogram of live pigs and 5.5 jiao per catty of fresh meat. All retailers will be supervised by the Fresh Meat Industry Association, and are absolutely not allowed to exceed the 819 limit price. (3) The police bureau will strictly supervise the prices in the vegetable markets.</p>
<p>The Psychology of Meat Vendors Should Be Corrected</p>
<p>According to reports from the slaughtering industry, the number of pigs slaughtered recently has not decreased. The main reason why the supply of fresh meat is so abnormal is that there is a misconception in the minds of ordinary retail meat vendors: They believe that if they trade at the limit price every day, the profit is limited. If they hide the meat and wait for the black market price to sell, then even if they are detained for three days, the expenses will be less than the profit from trading at the limit price. This psychology is also very common among ordinary vegetable vendors and should be corrected as soon as possible.</p>

Dadong and Zhendan were unable to provide any evidence to prove the plaintiff's rights had been extinguished. The court ruled as follows: "The publication transfer of 'Educational Measurement and Statistics' by the defendants is invalid. It is confirmed that the Zhendan Bookstore and Dadong Bookstore do not have publishing rights for the above book. Dadong Bookstore shall cease issuing the book and submit relevant ledgers of printing and sales for the plaintiff's inspection. The plaintiff's remaining claims and request for provisional execution are dismissed.

<h3>Chief Accountant of Minfeng Textile Mill Sued for Abandonment by Dancer</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ren Qianping, formerly a dancer at the Dadong Dance Hall, also known as Du Qianping, Yang Xiuying, and Yang Xingzhen, is now 29 years old. Seven years ago, while working as a dance partner at the Dadong Dance Hall, she met Yang Zhihuai, the chief accountant of the Dasimin Textile Mill. They fell in love at first sight and soon discussed marriage. They rented a house together in the Shanqingfang on Jing'an Temple Road. After marriage, their relationship was harmonious, and they have since had two children, Yang Yong and Yang Meimei. Recently, Ren learned that Yang already had a wife named Zhou Meiru, who lived in the Laidefang on Xiafei Road. Ren was unhappy that Yang had concealed this all along and argued with him. She also went to Yang's wife's place to argue. Once, Yang's wife sued her for interference with family, but the matter was settled through mediation. However, recently, Yang suddenly stopped visiting Ren's place. Ren believes that Yang's actions constitute intentional abandonment and has filed a complaint in the District Prosecutor's Office for the crime of abandonment. The case was heard by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. The court ordered another hearing to be scheduled as the defendant Yang Zhihuai claimed illness and did not attend.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Murder Case Unintentionally Solved, Two Killers Stealing for a Living, Confession to Old Case During Assault Complaint</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Thief Xia Caifa (from Changzhou, residing at No. 2, Lane 1084, Yang Road) and Zhou Xijiu (from Taizhou, residing at No. 127, Xin Zhou Road, a cleaner) stole 84 meters of telephone wire from a utility pole on Dalin Road, Lin Yin Road in the South City on the night of the 8th. They hid it at Zhou Xijiu's house. Xia sold the outer lead covering to the Tongchangtai used goods store on Pingjili Road and the bronze and tin shop opened by Huang Quanli at No. 430 Zhihao Bureau Road in the South City. Huang resold it to Jin Guangyan and others at No. 116 Huangjiaque Road. Later, Xia and Zhou fell out over the division of the loot. On the morning of the 14th, Xia and his accomplice Fang Changqing went to Zhou's place, intending to kill Zhou. Zhou resisted fiercely and was only slightly injured. Xia and others fled. A few days ago, Zhou discovered Xia's residence and reported him to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, accusing him of assault. Xia was arrested and transferred to the Penglai Police Station due to jurisdictional reasons. After strict interrogation by Criminal Section Chief Li Dazhi and section members Yang Mianzhi and others, they learned about the theft. Then, Police Chief Huang Shimin, Police Officer Wang Yimin, Zhang Yuting, and others were dispatched to Sanpailou in the city to arrest Fang Changqing and the receivers of stolen goods Huang Quanli and Jin Guangyan. At this point, Xia began to tell the truth and confessed to a previous murder case. He said that in November 1946, while working as an apprentice at Sun Yongxing Iron Shop in Henglin Town, Changzhou, he secretly manufactured a copper pistol, intending to murder his uncle in order to seize his property. However, Sun Huanzhang (14 years old), the shop owner's son, discovered and exposed his secret. Therefore, he harbored resentment and shifted his target, planning to murder the young owner. He once came to Shanghai and discussed it with Zhou, asking for his assistance. On December 16th, the two went to the countryside and lured Sun Huanzhang away from Changzhou, tricking him to the Zhutoubang area in the barren suburbs of Henglin. They first stripped off his clothes, tied him up with a rope, and threw him into the river. After his beloved son disappeared, Sun's teacher reported it to the village office, and Xia and Zhou were detained and investigated, but due to lack of evidence, the two were released. After returning to Shanghai, Zhou forged a letter, impersonating Huanzhang, and sent it back to Changzhou in order to cover up the crime. Sun's body floated up until February 1st of the following year. After investigation, the authorities informed his family to collect the body for burial. After coming to Shanghai, due to a lack of livelihood, they specialized in stealing. The bureau believes that the case is clear and plans to transfer it to the judicial authorities for trial.</p>

<h3>A Gold Yuan Tragedy and Comedy in the South</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>In this subtropical South, although there are bursts of golden wind in the morning and evening, it is still sunny at noon, and the sun is like fire. People on the streets are still walking around in single clothes. As a summer resort, Lychee Bay is still crowded with tourists, and the excitement has not diminished. And on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, many people went there to boat and enjoy the moon, which is a unique scene in the South.</p>
<p>Indeed, autumn is the most popular season in the South. Especially this year, the news of currency reform that came with the autumn wind made people especially excited. This excitement was originally the same all over the country, but it was even more intense here. Because Guangzhou, the only metropolis in South China, is close to Hong Kong and Macau. Since the restoration, due to the trouble caused by the Hong Kong dollar in the market, the financial situation has been turbulent and prices have soared. In the past two years, the general living standards have been more than twice as high as those in Beijing and Shanghai, and the industry and commerce in South China have been almost completely suffocated. Everyone seems to be fighting on the front line of the economy, without any chance to breathe, and the suffering of the people is even more unspeakable, so as soon as this order for the new currency system was issued, the people in South China were like a long drought meeting nectar. How could everyone not welcome it warmly? This currency reform is undoubtedly a brand-new page in Chinese economic history, and it is related to the suppression of chaos and the establishment of the country, and the future of the entire nation. Since such an important decision is implemented, it is naturally impossible to take all aspects into consideration completely. Therefore, the Gold Yuan Certificate has been issued in Guangzhou for nearly a month, and during this period, some tragedies and comedies have occurred:</p>
<p>Painful Sacrifice is Inevitable. After the currency is changed, the financial situation will no longer fluctuate, legitimate industry and commerce can be revived, and the shackles of the people's suffering can be removed from then on. However, after the order to change the currency was issued, the people in Guangdong first suffered a loss that was not found in other places. That is, the Legal Tender in their hands on August 19th was worth half the next day. The reason for this is: After Song Ziwen presided over Guangdong, due to the implementation of a tight currency policy, the prevention of floating capital flowing south, and the crackdown on speculation, the "Shen Telegraph" fell sharply. Before August 19th, the "Shen Telegraph" fell to 50, that is, 500,000 yuan remitted from Guangzhou, and 1 million yuan could be received in Shanghai. At that time, the black market Hong Kong dollar in Shanghai was worth more than 2 million Legal Tender per dollar, while in Guangzhou it was still worth about 1.1 million yuan. After the Gold Yuan was issued, it was stipulated that each Hong Kong dollar was worth 2.25 million Legal Tender, which was not far from the original value in Shanghai, but in Guangzhou it doubled. Wasn't that the Legal Tender in the hands of the people of Guangzhou at that time, watching it lose half its value? Therefore, Chairman Song specifically pointed out at the financial and price symposium on August 23rd: "After the Gold Yuan is issued, there will inevitably be difficulties at present, and the suffering felt by the people of Guangdong is greater than in other places... I sincerely hope that the people of Guangdong will understand the overall situation deeply. Although they feel considerable difficulties due to the currency system reform, this is related to the survival of the entire country and nation. Everyone must have a spirit of sacrifice and faithfully implement the government's currency reform and emergency measures." This shows his sympathy for the people of Guangdong and his earnest encouragement.</p>
<p>Financial and Price Surge. Precisely because there are: The stipulated price difference of the Hong Kong dollar is too far away, smuggling has not been curbed, and these special relationships have caused drastic changes in the financial situation after the announcement of the currency change, and prices have soared, even more than in previous financial surges. From August 23rd to 26th, the municipal government successively assessed the public prices of the main necessities of people's livelihood, but because the inspection was not strict enough, unscrupulous merchants still raised prices, and financial speculators made waves, and also made a black market for the Hong Kong dollar, deliberately discounting the Gold Yuan. According to regulations, 75 Gold Yuan was worth 100 Hong Kong dollars. But for a very short period of time, the black market Hong Kong dollar actually involved exchanging it for Gold Yuan at par. The chaotic situation in the market at this time was unprecedented.</p>
<p>War of Words Between the City Government and Provincial Council At the same time, the public prices of various items assessed by the municipal government were generally considered too high, with an average increase of one time compared with before August 19th, which increased the suffering of the people. The National Assembly representatives, legislators, supervisors, and city party departments of Guangdong and Guangzhou unanimously criticized it. The Guangdong Provincial Council sent a telegram to President Chiang, asking him to strictly order the supervisors in charge to thoroughly investigate and deal with it, which aroused a war of words between the Provincial Council and the City Government: The City Government published in the city's newspapers on September 11th its "Evaluation Process and Principles", totaling tens of thousands of words, stating in detail that the city is a consumer market, and everything has to rely on external imports. If the pricing is too low, it is feared that the market will be blocked, so the principle of price assessment is based on the prices on August 19th, the reasonable cost, and the need to consider reducing production and reducing sources; and it pointed out that the Provincial Council was "ignoring the facts." Therefore, the gentlemen of the Provincial Council became even more indignant and immediately decided to draft a document refuting the City Government and collect evidence to present to the President again. This dispute caused by prices is still developing.</p>
<p>Wu Song is Here, Welcomed with Firecrackers</p>
<p>In this bad situation, there is also an interesting episode: About a week ago, there was a rumor here that Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo would come to Guangzhou. They gave Mr. Chiang the nickname "Wu Song." Two days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, firecrackers were suddenly set off everywhere. Someone said that "Wu Song" was coming today! So they set off firecrackers to welcome him. Even the police on the street said so, which startled the reporter, because wouldn't this news be leaked? I went everywhere to inquire, but it turned out to be some kind of god's birthday, and I couldn't help but smile. However, this also shows the general public's desire for governance.</p>
<p>Strict Enforcement of Economic Controls</p>
<p>On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, a large amount of capital from Shanghai fled to Hong Kong, and the black market exchange rate in Hong Kong increased sharply. The price fluctuations here have not stopped slightly. But after August 8th and 9th, everything completely stabilized. Because the Guangzhou District Economic Control Supervisor's Office officially started work on the 6th, and then, following the example of Shanghai, established three committees for price review, inspection, and material regulation. On the 8th, Song, who was also the Supervisor in charge, Ziwen, issued measures to restrict remittances to prevent Shanghai funds from fleeing south. At that time, Huo Baoshu took on the role of the assistant supervisor of economic control in the posture of a "warrior." He said to people: This time he came back to his hometown to do economic management work, he will strictly enforce the law and never show favoritism. Even if he breaks off relations with his relatives and his ancestral tomb is dug up, he will not hesitate, so as to express his determination to only allow success. In terms of inspection work, it exerted the pressure of thunder and lightning, mobilizing all the resident military police personnel in the city to conduct a general inspection. In recent days, more than a dozen privately set up radio stations have been seized, and more than 200 people who bought and sold financial products and raised prices have been arrested.</p>
<p>The main camp of manipulating the black market finance, "Thirteen Hongs," was in an uproar, who would dare to test the law again? Some silversmiths who usually specialize in this business also voluntarily closed down. This completely curbed the black market financial activities, and prices stabilized. Especially before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the silver market was tight, and the situation of various banks and bureaus exchanging Gold Yuan Certificates was even more enthusiastic than ever. Although they did not stop exchanging on Sundays, there was still not enough time to cope. Some people who had more foreign currency were eager to need Gold Yuan turnover, so they were willing to exchange Hong Kong dollars to the banks at a ratio of 71.72. This phenomenon of the Hong Kong dollar black market being lower than the public price is really unprecedented since the restoration. From here, we can also see the bright future of the Gold Yuan Certificate.</p>
<h3>Bandits Harass the Yangtai Highway, Ambush Cars, and Rob Ships</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 20th] Bandits harassed the area near Guangfu Bridge on the Yangtai Highway on the 16th. That morning, a passenger bus from the Taiyang Automobile Company, carrying over twenty passengers, was ambushed by bandits wielding machine guns as it passed through the area at noon. The driver quickly sped east, arriving in Qin County around 1 p.m. The driver, Tang Xueshi, sustained a shrapnel wound to his left finger. Due to the excessive speed, passengers suffered minor injuries from being jostled about. On the same day, the "Xie Jun" steamship, traveling from Zhenjiang to Qinzhou and towing two wooden boats, was near Wangjia River, close to Guangfu Bridge, when four bandits fired shots, ordering it to stop. After docking, the four bandits boarded the ship and ordered the passengers to disembark for inspection. After an hour, they confiscated four rifles and one passenger's wallet, causing no other harm. The ship safely arrived in Taicheng at 8 p.m. Also: on the same day, a scheduled ship traveling from Tai to Zhen discovered bandit activity ahead near Wangjia River and immediately turned back to Tai, thus avoiding losses. For days, the garrisons of Jiangdu and Taixian counties have been conducting suppression operations by land and water along the Yangtai and Yangzhen routes. The scattered bandits have been driven far away, and transportation on both lines has returned to normal.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion of the Lawyer's Convention and Events Surrounding It</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] As the Legislative Yuan reconvened in the capital on September 7th, and the Constitutional Oversight Committee was established in the capital on September 9th, the legal profession, entrusted with the mission of enforcing national laws and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of the people, was also engaged in a major gathering. This was the establishment of the "National Federation of Lawyers Associations of the Republic of China" in the capital, and the successive convening of the association's "First Member Representative Congress."</p>
<p>Because this gathering was clearly different in nature from the gatherings of general professional associations, it was continuously observed by the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Central Organization Department of the Kuomintang from September 9th (the day the association was founded) to September 14th (the day the association's member representative congress concluded). The fact that the aforementioned authorities held tea parties for all representatives of the association a total of five times in six days is a clear indication of this. Furthermore, Mr. Ting De, an advisor at the Ministry of Judicial Administration, seemed particularly interested in this gathering and gave several speeches.</p>
<p>The Process of Organization</p>
<p>Before the war, the legal profession had an organization called the "National Lawyers Association," which was based on "natural persons." After the war, due to different historical backgrounds, the "National Federation of Lawyers Associations," based on "legal persons," was established. There are currently 104 local lawyers associations nationwide. The establishment of the federation was initiated by 29 units, including Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Changchun. After six months of tireless planning by preparatory committee members Dai Xiuzan, Jiang Yiping, Yu Zhongluo, and Dai Tianqiu, and with the coordination of manpower and resources, this organization for the legal profession was finally established.</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Congress</p>
<p>The founding congress of the association was held at 9 a.m. on September 9th at the Overseas Chinese Hostel on Zhongshan North Road. Those in attendance included Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan; Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan; Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs; Xie Guansheng, Minister of Judicial Administration; and Zhang Zhiben, President of the Administrative Court. The President also issued a special message of instruction. The "Representative Congress" was held daily from the 10th onwards on the second floor of the Builders' Association at Shangsheng Temple. The final total number of delegates attending reached 133. Many of them were authorities in legal circles. Those holding dual roles as lawyers and legislators included Jiang Yiping, Zhu Wende, Fang Jida, Wu Shipeng, Zhai Nianqu, and Liu Pengying. Those holding dual roles as lawyers and National Assembly representatives included Dai Tianqiu, Zhang Danping, Jin Chunhua, Cheng Shenlin, Wang Shanxiang, Qiu Zhaowen, Chen Wei, Yu Junzhu, Lu Huimin, Zhang Huanzhi, and Su Shangwen. Others, such as Jun Shizhao and Guo Wei, traveled from Shanghai to participate. It could truly be said that a great number of talents gathered together.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions</p>
<p>In the eyes of experts deeply versed in legal principles, some of the country's current laws are outdated or fundamentally at odds with the practical demands of democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, at their grand gathering, based on the standpoint of national democratic constitutional law, they submitted more than one hundred proposals to the legislative and judicial administrative authorities to abolish or amend these laws and to enact new laws that meet the demands of reality. Among the most important of these that have been passed by the congress are: (1) "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan promptly enact a law on compensation for wrongful convictions"; (2) "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan abolish various special criminal regulations and criminal case procedural regulations"; and (3) "Recommend that the authorities amend the Law of Court Martial for the Army, Navy, and Air Force."</p>
<p>Regarding (1) – "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan promptly enact a law on compensation for wrongful convictions," it is said that this was a goal that the former "National Lawyers Association" strived for at every congress from 1931 to 1937. Now, in an era of constitutional governance and new beginnings, the system of compensation for wrongful convictions, which has been proposed for many years, truly needs to be established in a timely manner. According to sources, this resolution has already received a response from the Legislative Yuan, which is preparing to enact this law immediately.</p>
<p>Regarding (2), "Recommend that the Legislative Yuan abolish various special criminal regulations and criminal case procedural regulations," their decision is naturally still based on the fundamental principle of democratic constitutionalism, to safeguard human rights and demonstrate prudence.</p>
<p>Regarding (3), "Recommend that the authorities amend the Law of Court Martial for the Army, Navy, and Air Force," the lawyers made this proposal because they saw the unreasonableness of military personnel committing ordinary criminal offenses and often not being judged under ordinary law.</p>
<p>Capital Disputes</p>
<p>The so-called capital dispute refers to the dispute over the legality of the representatives produced by the Capital Lawyers Association. The issue arose from the manner in which the Capital Lawyers Association selected its representatives. The five representatives from the capital, Dai Xiuzan, Sun Biren, Xue Fuqi, Wang Hongjiang, and Zhao Wenqi, were nominated by the association's board of directors. Lawyers Wang Long, Cui Peijun, and Yu Xizu and others rose up in opposition, arguing that it was illegal because the selection had not been made by the general membership meeting. Thus, both sides published "Announcements" on the front page of the "Central Daily News." The "Federation" has already concluded, but until now, the dispute does not seem to have been resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>At the association's fourth meeting on the 13th, it was resolved that September 9th would be "Lawyer's Day," and Xu Shihao, Chen Yaodong, He Shizhen, Chen Tingrui, and Hu Jingming were nominated as representatives to attend the next International Bar Association conference. On the morning of the 14th, the directors and supervisors were elected, and the closing ceremony was held in the afternoon. On the 15th, the association convened its first board of directors meeting and elected standing directors. As a result, Jiang Yiping, Dai Tianqiu, Bao Xiangling, Ji Qingyi, Zhang Qiping, Zhang Wenbo, Bo Chou, Zhu Wende, and Wang Bingjun were elected.</p>
<h3>Strange Event in Anhua, Hunan Province: White-Haired Old Man Loses Love and Seeks Immortality in Shifang Cave</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 18th] A strange incident of seeking immortality has recently occurred in Anhua County, Hunan Province, causing a sensation among pious men and women. It is said that there is a barber named Jiang Pusheng in the south gate of the county, who is 72 years old. He is usually fond of lust, and in recent years has been in love with a young woman named Tao Xian, who is only 18 years old. The romance between the white-haired old man and the beautiful young woman is intense, amazing all who hear of it. But the moon is not always full. Tao Xian has found another lover, and suddenly announced that she would break off relations with Jiang. Jiang was so stimulated that he suddenly disappeared on the night of the 5th of this month. Because he has no relatives, his neighbors are indifferent to it. Until the 9th, someone who came to the city from Zunshang, thirty miles outside the north gate, talked about this matter, saying that he had personally seen Jiang carrying straw alone into the Shifang Cave in that area, and had not seen him come out since, not knowing why. Thereupon, Jiang's neighbors, hearing the news, gathered several people and went to investigate. Arriving at Zunshang, each prepared torches, and shouted as they entered the cave. The cave is located at the foot of a high mountain, and the entrance is about a square zhang wide. After entering fifty or sixty steps, it becomes a dark abyss, its distance unfathomable. When the neighbors risked entering dozens of steps, they found the missing old barber curled up on the straw, snoring loudly, as if he were having a good dream. The neighbors shouted Jiang's name, and after a long time, Jiang slightly opened his eyes. When the neighbors advised Jiang to return home, Jiang suddenly stood up angrily and threw stones. Five of the neighbors, including Wu Xiang, were slightly injured and fled with their heads in their hands. Jiang also cursed loudly, saying, "I have not eaten for five days, and my cultivation of immortality is about to be completed. What is it to you?" Now, people from far and wide have heard the news and are vying to visit this "future immortal" in Shifang Cave. The flow of visitors never stops. Several nearby residents have built temporary shacks outside the cave, running tea shops, wine shops, and hotels, and business is unusually busy.</p>
<h3>The Surrender of the Notorious Bandit Kuang Guojun in Shaoyang: The Process</h3>
<p>[Our Changsha Dispatch, 18th] Kuang Guojun, a notorious bandit who has been harassing the eastern countryside of Shaoyang for many years and is as famous as the bandit Zhang Pengfei, who has already been executed, has recently been formally announced by the Sixth District Commissioner's Office to have surrendered. Fifty-nine men and thirty-one guns, including a light machine gun, have been received. The process of accepting the surrender began in mid-August. At that time, Kuang made several demands, but the Sixth District Commissioner's Office insisted on unconditional surrender. Kuang finally agreed to accept. On August 31st, Commissioner Wei Zhen personally went to the bandit's den in Zhujia Chong to inspect and give instructions. Because the hostages kidnapped by the bandits had not yet been released, they were not formally registered at that time. Wei immediately returned to the city, leaving Deputy Commander Zhang Bohou of the Security Corps to handle matters in the countryside.

<h3>Seclusion of Xue Fen's Family After His Death: Fudan Faculty and Students Discuss Aftercare</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Dr. Xue Fen, professor and head of the Biology Department at National Fudan University, traveled to England for investigation and research at the invitation of the British Council. He left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the first of this month and took a ship to England, where he died in Penang on the 10th. The news has already been reported in this newspaper. It is said that he suffered from asthma on the ship, which later developed into heart disease, leading to his death. Xue passed the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Scholarship in his early years and studied in England, earning a Ph.D. from the University of Liverpool. He also traveled to various European countries. Since 1941, he has taught at National Fudan University. Recently, in view of the long coastline of our country and the urgent need to develop marine science, he was planning a project and went to England for investigation and research again. His great aspirations were not fulfilled, and he died in a foreign land, which is truly regrettable! Xue left behind many children, all of whom are young. His income from teaching during his lifetime was only enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. It is said that the Ministry of Education, President Zhang of Fudan University, and colleagues and students are discussing aftercare and plan to raise an education fund for Xue's children to fulfill the deceased's ambition to dedicate himself to scholarship. Ms. Grant, Chief Representative of the British Council in China, has also sent a letter expressing her condolences and concern for the future life of Xue's family.</p>

<h3>Request to Adjust Salaries: Hope to Restore Pre-War Standards; Municipal School Teachers Welfare Association Issues Written Opinion Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal School Teachers Welfare Association issued a written opinion requesting an adjustment to the salaries of public school teachers. In response to the call from professors at national colleges and universities in the capital and Shanghai to adjust the salaries of public school teachers nationwide, the Shanghai Municipal School Teachers Welfare Promotion Association hereby issues the following written opinion: (Previous content omitted) This association, on behalf of thousands of members of Shanghai's municipal primary and secondary schools, not only expresses its unanimous support for the call from professors at national colleges and universities in Beijing and Shanghai, but also expresses its full and resolute support for the rapid implementation of this demand. We also put forward our minimum requirement, which is simply to restore pre-war standards. As the professors in the capital said, "The salary adjustment for public school teachers nationwide is often unreasonable and the government should adjust it again according to pre-war standards." Taking municipal primary schools as an example, the pre-war salary for ordinary teachers was 45 to 50 yuan. Now, calculating the silver yuan price stipulated by the government at 20%, the base salary should be adjusted to at least 90 to 100 yuan. This requirement is not excessive in the slightest, and we have only put forward this reasonable opinion after deeply understanding the difficulties of the times. We firmly demand that the government consider the lives of public school teachers across the country and make adjustments promptly. Then the improvement of administrative efficiency can be expected, and the stability of society can be gradually realized.</p>

<h3>Ye Guanxiong Suffers Crushing Defeat in Straight Sets Tao Guanqiu Wins Championship Public Tennis Final Sees Unprecedented Spectacle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] City Open Tennis champion Tao Guanqiu, relying on his steady, reliable, and extremely accurate long strokes and short volleys, defeated the current National Games champion Ye Guanxiong in straight sets in his peak condition yesterday to continue to hold the title. At the same time, he also avenged his defeat to Ye Guanxiong in one set in the National Games. The scores were 6-2, 9-7, 6-0. The performances of both sides were quite exciting. The Youth Tennis Club announced yesterday that it was sold out, with an estimated 1,000 ladies and gentlemen in the seats, creating the biggest spectacle of this year's event. Before the match, in the women's singles final, Yang Weibin defeated Zhu Zhiying in three sets to retain the championship, with scores of 3-6, 6-0, 6-1. In the intermediate singles final, Ma Jingrong defeated Wei Shisun 6-1, 6-2, winning the double championship after the preliminary singles. The match details are as follows.</p>
<h3>Tao Guanqiu Indeed Has Brilliance</h3>
<p>The audience in the stands has high hopes for the emergence of a new tennis talent, so many hoped that Ye Guanxiong would win and there would be a new champion. Therefore, when they saw Ye's defeat, they all sighed with regret. However, Tao Guanqiu does have his own unique brilliance. His steadiness can be said to be one in a hundred. In the first set, Ye Guanxiong tried his best to take the offensive, fiercely pulling the ball up to the net, but as a result, Tao won by a large margin of 6-2. The general trend of the world seems to have been largely determined. There were already predictions for a straight-set victory. Tao Guanqiu's strengths are so difficult to break. Since Ye Guanxiong could not win by pressing the net, he made numerous mistakes in the first set, with countless balls touching the net and going out of bounds. In the second set, Ye changed his style, repeatedly using long strokes and short volleys to attack, which happened to be to Tao's advantage. The steadier he played, the worse he performed. He took the lead at 4-2 and was chased by Tao to 4-4. Then he took the lead again at 5-4, 6-5, and 7-6, but Tao Guanqiu won three games and ended the second set at 9-7. When Ye took the lead at 6-5, Ye lost a set point, and the score was leveled at 6-6, which was a pity. In the first half of the second set, both sides fought fiercely. In the second half of the set, both were exhausted. Tao once looked impatient, but Ye touched the net and went out of bounds, unable to catch his breath. In the third set, Ye was unwilling to fight and had already indicated his abandonment. After two sliding games, Tao Guanqiu won six games in a row, completing the straight-set victory. , Women's Singles Champion and Runner-up (Right) Yang Weibin (Left) Zhu Zhiying (China News Agency Photo)</p>
<h3>Ye Guanxiong is Slightly Inferior</h3>
<p>It was expected that Ye Guanxiong would have such difficulty defeating Wang Wenzheng and would have difficulty defeating Tao Guanqiu. This shows that his skill is not yet up to par, and there is much room for improvement. With today's Tao Guanqiu, one must have Carson's golden age and Xu Chengji's ball skills to defeat him. The speed must also be increased, and the net strokes must be deeper and more accurate, and the net kills must be fierce. Mid-court balls are useless, and short balls and close balls landing can only be used occasionally. If this is the case, there is hope for defeating Tao Guanqiu in straight sets. Yesterday, Tao took the lead at 4-1 in the first set. Ye won Tao's serve, and Tao won two more games in a row, winning 6-2 easily, which was unexpected. In the second set, Ye took the lead at 4-2 and 5-4. In the eighth game, when Tao served at 4-3, Ye actually lost five points at 15-40, resulting in 4-4. In the subsequent games, after repeated equalizations, Tao finally won. This is a sign of a lack of confidence. The outcome has been decided, Ye Guanxiong has a long way to go, and Tao Guanqiu does have something to commend.</p>
<p>In the women's singles final, Zhu Zhiying arrived late. The first set was quite exciting, but she was exhausted in the second and third sets. Yang Weibin was consistent throughout and is indeed a veteran. The results of the three groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Intermediate Singles Final</p>
<p>Women's Singles Final</p>
<p>Advanced Singles Final</p>

Tao and Wang were the champions of the previous event and are well-coordinated. The hope of defending the title is very high, but although Cai Guoji is weaker, Ye Guanxiong has already been frustrated in the singles yesterday. If he can achieve something in the evening, he has great ambitions to win the doubles. There is bound to be a fierce battle at that time. With this match, the entire event will be successfully completed. Today's order is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cangjie Invents Characters</h3>
<p>— Wu Yong</p>
<p>Jin Shenghuan said: "The invention of characters does not necessarily depend on Cangjie, but it must depend on Cangjie. In that case, the name of Cangjie does not belong to one person alone." He also said, "Everyone can make characters." Xunzi's "Solution of Obstructions" also said: "There are many who invented characters, but only Cangjie is uniquely passed down." This theory is very appropriate. For example, the "Records of the Grand Historian" is known to everyone as the work of Sima Qian, the Grand Historian of the Han Dynasty. In fact, it quoted many ancient books such as the "Zuo Zhuan" and "Strategies of the States." Sima Qian was the great synthesizer, and Ban Gu was the great synthesizer of the great synthesizer.</p>
<p>Another example is the origin of printing from seals, rubbings from stone inscriptions. The turning point in the idea of ​​printing from rubbings is estimated to have taken 500 years. Therefore, tracing back to the root, the invention of printing cannot be attributed to any one person. The same is true of writing brushes, ink, paper, and even modern inventions such as electric lights, telephones, ships, trains, and so on. There are many cases of simultaneous and individual inventions in different places, which shows that the invention is an inevitable result of the progress of the times. If Marconi did not invent the telegraph, Niukeni would have come out. This point is explained in detail in W.F. Auben's book "Social Change", with extensive references and sufficient evidence, making it impossible not to be convinced.</p>
<p>Changes in social systems and shifts in popular customs can also be viewed in the same way. The prosperity of other countries' politics and the decline of our country's national affairs are only a continuation of past historical evolution. Their origins are gradual, not brought about by one day or one night, nor can one person alone be responsible for their merits and demerits. As the saying goes: "One general succeeds, ten thousand bones wither." This saying sympathizes with the ten thousand bones and blames one general alone. It is indeed worthy to sympathize with the ten thousand bones, but why do the ten thousand bones die wholeheartedly and willingly wither for him, so that the boy becomes famous? Therefore, according to reason, there are still some shortcomings. Therefore, when evaluating people and discussing things, we must remember: culture is cumulative, and martial culture is also cumulative.</p>
<h3>Oxygen Expert</h3>
<p>— Old Man Half-Dream</p>
<p>The backwardness of our country's industry is due to the lack of talent, but talent can be cultivated. As long as the authorities vigorously promote it, all those who study abroad must study the latest and most recent scientific inventions in European countries. After returning to China, the government should first promote them and actively organize the latest industries to provide a place for those who have completed their studies to display their talents, so as to avoid the traditional drawbacks of "not using what they have learned and not learning what they use." In this way, how can the country not flourish?</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Qian Shiqing, who once served as the supervisor of students studying in Europe, had long understood this matter. Therefore, when his brother Mr. Yunsheng went to study in England in the year of Dingchou, he chose oxygen and devoted himself to research. Years ago, he obtained a Master of Mechanical Engineering and still stayed in England for three years of practical training. He obtained a Doctor of Chemical Engineering and achieved success in oxygen research. He can be regarded as the first person in China to study oxygen.</p>
<p>However, it is said that before Yunsheng returned to China, he had already accepted a professorship at Tsinghua University in Beiping. He can indeed instill the theories he has learned into the minds of general university students, but it is a pity that the country does not allocate funds to organize an oxygen chemical plant for him to develop what he has learned.</p>
<p>On his way back to China, Yunsheng composed four poems and sent them to his father, expressing many feelings. One poem says: "In my youth, I was bold and unrestrained, traveling all over the world and the oceans. The advanced countries of Europe and America, the great cause of the ages lies in the people's livelihood." The second poem says: "From the beginning, those who have aspirations can succeed. I have devoted myself to engineering for ten years. I am fortunate to have obtained a doctorate, but I still hesitate to serve the country." The third poem says: "The morals of all nations are from the old, and science is now always new. Even if atoms can threaten the four seas, seeking peace requires benevolence." The fourth poem says: "The virtue of the former kings protects the descendants, and the hard work of parents is beyond words. The sound of the woodcutters' machine reminds me of the past. When will I be able to repay my parents' kindness!"</p>
<p>His respected Mr. Shiqing copied and sent them to colleagues for poems in response. Jin Xihou said: "Overseas, the flowers on the road bloom again. The prince slowly composes poems about returning by raft. He makes colorful flower dances in brocade clothes, and he is the first family in Wu and Yue." Yu Jingzhai said: "Ten years of diligent study, the art is equally respected. His fame abroad moves the nine pavilions. The students in the classroom look forward to him eagerly, admiring him for having a garden full of peaches and plums. (After returning to China, he taught at Tsinghua University.) The jade trees and orchids in the courtyard are even more beautiful. He returns home after thousands of miles of sailing with a smile. Loyalty and filial piety are passed down from the family, and I am happy to see him dancing in brocade clothes in front of the hall." Jia Jingzhai said: "He has been studying diligently overseas for many years, and he is determined to start a career with refined craftsmanship. He seeks a magical way to save the world, and he supports the weak and saves the people." Qiao Kemaoting brushes the clouds with its branches, and the rain and dew nurture the emerald green. He is outstanding in poetry and elegance, and he brings back the poems of the sea and sky to the court." I also followed the rhymes and wrote poems in response, which are not included here.</p>
<p>Mr. Shiqing inscribed on the portrait he sent: "On the 13th day of August, in the year of Dingchou, the artillery fire in Shanghai was continuous. The ceasefire was at two o'clock to evacuate overseas Chinese. The sea wheel docked in Wusong. The four children risked taking the wheel to study overseas with a firm will. They rode the wind and waves for thousands of miles, and the specialized academic expenses were discussed and studied. After only one year at the University of London, the population was evacuated again. The school was moved to Edinburgh, and the credits from London were not counted. Jing'er first negotiated with them, temporarily changing the regulations and asking them to follow the authority. The evacuation was in accordance with the intentions of the authorities, and the students should not be blamed. The excess tuition fees were raised, and academic and diplomatic relations should be taken care of. I wrote to the board of directors of the school, and the original credits were allowed to be supplemented. Many students studying in England cited this as an example, and my false name has been passed down to this day. After four years of graduation, I entered the factory to practice and study the atmosphere of the atmosphere is fresh. Now the factory affairs have been completed, and the deputy engineer is qualified. It is a good opportunity once in a thousand years, and studying can reach the true essence. Learning is valuable to compare and divide the good from the bad, and conduct on-the-spot inspections before returning. I sent the graduation portrait by post, and I am very happy to see it now. Relatives and friends come to ask from time to time, so I will report it with a piece of paper. The four children are still unmarried, and marriage can be discussed when they return. It has been seven years since they went abroad, and the country is in distress and chaos. The rivers and mountains are still the same, but only the river water still has the surname Qian." He described the facts of his study abroad, and the style is like that of Bai Juyi. I sincerely hope that after Mr. Yunsheng returns to China, he will develop and promote what he has learned, uphold his long-standing patriotic spirit, support the country, and move towards a scientific position. Then, can we not say that China has no hope?</p>
<h3>Long Song to the Moon on Mid-Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>How can the heart of the old man be wrong? The sun strengthens me, and the moon deepens my opportunity. I have feelings of eternity, and I often express them to the moon. Express and express again, and express their signs one by one. The sky cannot always be clear, and clouds often cover the moonlight. I am the cloud for the moon, and this is not my personal feeling. Who in the vast world likes the night to be blind? Counting the Mid-Autumn Festivals, the earth complains and the sky is sad! Strange winds and rain seem to be enemies of the moon! Last year's today became a false hope, but this year's today is as happy as crazy. The fourteenth night is bright, and the fifteenth day is dignified. Sugar taro is like a fist and moon cakes are sweet, and everything goes well and can be forgotten. As expected, there is a full moon in the night, as bright as silver as I wish. Even if there are black clouds like monsters, they do not interfere with each other, nor are they close to each other. Each goes its own way, and embraces its own truth, so that the people of the world who look up to the sky, the barbarian emperor and the barbarian sky, make this night the moon god's festival. Colorful curtains and incense burners, the colors and grades are all displayed. It is pitiful to see the children, gathering together to worship frequently. When asked what they wish for? National peace and people's prosperity. When I hear this, I feel ashamed, and my heart sinks, only knowing how to play with its color, not knowing fraternity and benevolence. Moon, shine upon the sky tonight, and see how many people there are in the world! How is the north? How is the east and west? How is the Central Plains? How can I bear to ask, but feel sad! Moon, O Moon, You have hands, and I know that there is something pulling your elbow. You have a head, and I know that you can only shake right and shake left. You have a mouth, and I know that you can only groan and not roar! Moon, O Moon, I am tired, I will re-order this year for next year. There are still ten thousand miles in the long sky, I will ride the toad while walking; I cannot defend you, but I think for you, the wind is strong, and the clouds are foolish!</p>
<h3>Grand Academician Li Gen</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>I read "Free Talk" on September 14, which contained my friend Wu Zongcan's "Remembering Li Gen" (Pan) and mentioned Mei Ximing. Jin recalled that Ximing once wrote a poem to Gen Da, saying: "He is respected in Pengcheng Prefecture, and his name is high in the Jinshi Department. His appearance is like Jiang Bo, and his pen is like Xiao He. The root still produces sons, and a 'fan' is added to the insect. The most difficult thing to learn is thirty-six cakes." Gen Da's appearance was ugly like a martial artist. On the day of the palace examination, he carried thirty-six cakes in his chest, which he ate almost entirely. When he was a student, he was known for his pen. Therefore, Ximing's poem is also teasing and abusive. Gen Da and Ximing both met with misfortune due to the imperial examination case. Is this also the obvious retribution for their lifelong misdeeds? The world always believes that the champion should have a handsome appearance. Gen Da's appearance is not as good as the average person, and his literary talent is not quick. It is appropriate that he is ridiculed by ordinary people. Ximing is a famous scholar, and he is also from the same department as Gen Huo. However, he also made evil jokes about him, so it is not without jealousy and resentment, and he repaid him with evil words. This is also the worst of the unprincipled scholars. Gen Da has no works handed down to the world. Today, those who still know his name are only because of his ugly appearance and ugly deeds. How strange!</p>
<h3>Strange Thief</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The mayor's office in a certain town on the riverside of the Idaho River in the United States recently accepted a theft case. The stolen thing was a steel bridge in a remote area of the river, weighing 20 tons and 40 feet long. The highway authority thought that the bridge was of no practical use, so they sent someone to investigate and wanted to move it elsewhere. Unexpectedly, when they looked at that place, it had already been stolen.</p>
<p>In Algonquin City, Illinois, the residents have good character, and the police station has been idle for many days, so the police authority is very gratified and specially held a banquet to entertain all the police officers. Unexpectedly, while they were happily celebrating peace, someone secretly sneaked into the police station and stole two pistols, three boxes of bullets, and ten police badges - even the key to the prison gate was taken away.</p>
<p>Someone in Baltimore called the police and said that he had lost a good police dog. According to him, the police dog was best at catching thieves and was guarding the door when it was stolen.</p>
<p>A resident of Michigan, named Clark, suddenly found a thief in his garage one day when he returned home. The thief was stealing his car repair tools. Clark was furious and couldn't help but curse loudly, and ran up to try to beat him up. The thief saw that it was not good and quickly ran away. Clark couldn't catch up, turned around and sorted out the things that were almost stolen. After sorting for half an hour, he looked up and saw that the thief was in front of him again. He saw that his face was ferocious and he took out a pistol, scaring Clark to the color of earth. The thief restarted and put the best of the car repair tools in his bag, and then walked up and took away the two hundred and seventy-three US dollars from Clark. Before leaving, he also said: "You won't curse people as soon as you open your mouth in the future, will you?"</p>
<h3>Yushan Misty Rain</h3>
<p>— Lu Qingzhao</p>
<p>Yushan, also known as Ma'anshan, is one of the famous scenic spots in Kunshan. It is located to the north of the county seat. The scenery is beautiful and it enjoys a good reputation. Every spring and autumn, tourists come in droves. If you take the Jinghu Railway and pass through Kunshan Station, you can vaguely see it by looking out.</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for more than ten years. This time I came back, seeing Yushan was like seeing an old friend, so I stole half a day of leisure from my busy life, encouraged myself to climb and enjoy the scenery to my heart's content. Although it was already early autumn, the weather still had the feeling of summer. As I walked to the middle of the mountain, suddenly dark clouds gathered and it started to rain. Fearing that the rain would get heavier and heavier, I quickened my pace and rushed to the top of the mountain, lingering in the corridor of the temple. Looking around, it was quiet, and there was a unique taste of calmness. I leaned on the railing and quietly watched the mountain scenery shrouded in misty rain, which looked like a painting, and I felt that the colors were suitable, and the beauty was overwhelming.</p>
<p>At this time, the entire mountain peak was painted with light yellow and light green colors. The curling clouds floated from bottom to top, from white to gray, and drifted slowly in the air. Looking far away, the clouds and trees were vast, very much like a vast and boundless sea of fog. Floating clouds blew past the treetops, fluttering in the wind and scattering into the distance. Dense raindrops hit the iron railings, making a series of ringing echoes. A gust of wind blew through the green bamboo, and they collided with each other, making a sound like silk being torn. Thus, the sound of rain and the sound of bamboo, like broken jade and metal, joined the mountain colors and sky colors that were rich and light like a painting.</p>
<p>Yushan has some artificial decorations, but once it is washed by the mountain rain, it is like washing away the extravagant makeup and returning to its pure color.</p>
<p>The misty rain is hazy, and the forest and trees are fluttering, which is really an indescribable beauty. When I went down the mountain, I looked back at the exquisite small pagoda on the top of the mountain, faintly visible in the sea of clouds, like a layer of light gauze covering the face of a girl, making the tourists linger endlessly. I saw it unintentionally, and it can also be said that it was destined.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Stone Carving Art</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>One of the greatest arts of China, and regarded by the world as possessing value in the history of world culture, is stone carving. Open any book discussing Chinese art, and Chinese stone carvings always occupy the most glorious page.</p>
<p>Firstly, because the relics of stone carving are of such ancient times, they are the crown of our country's art. Chinese architecture is undoubtedly magnificent, Chinese painting is undoubtedly splendid, but the architecture of the Han dynasty has long since turned to ashes, and the paintings of the Six Dynasties and Tang dynasty only survive in the wall paintings of the Dunhuang grottoes, while many Han dynasty stone carvings still exist, and even stone carvings from the Shang dynasty were excavated not long ago in the underground of Anyang. Secondly, the greatness of the stone carving project is simply unparalleled. For example, the initial construction of the three grottoes at Longmen Mountain in Luoyang, Henan, took 25 years and cost 802,366 workdays. Furthermore, the Buddha statues in the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, Shanxi, are dozens of times larger than those in Longmen, so how astonishing their construction is, it is difficult to imagine. Thirdly, the richness and excellence of stone carving art, as well as the multitude of subjects, are also beyond the reach of any other art in our country. The carving and decoration of stone carvings are truly a synthesis of Chinese and foreign sculpture, with Chinese style, Indian style, and Greek style, all of which can be seen in various stone carvings in various places. As for the breadth of the subjects of stone carvings, there are China's most ancient myths, war history, religion, and various other historical sites. The universality and longevity of stone carving art also occupy the leading edge of our country's art realm. Ancient stone carvings have been discovered in Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Sichuan, and other places. Those nearby include stone carvings of figures still remaining on the tomb of Lu Shen in Pudong, Shanghai. Even today, one or two master craftsmen of stone carving can still be found in Suzhou. Although these great stone carving masters do not explicitly hold the title of sculptor, it is indeed through them that we have maintained our Chinese carving art for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The reason why China's stone carving relics can be so abundant is twofold: one is that the custom of lavish burials from the Han dynasty onwards has never been interrupted, and the other is the popularization of Buddhist propaganda. The former preserved Han tomb stone carvings in Shandong, Sichuan, and other places, and the latter preserved Buddhist grottoes in Henan, Shanxi, and other places.</p>
<p>Classified by carving method, stone carvings in our country can be roughly divided into two categories: one is three-dimensional, such as stone figures, stone horses, and stone lions, and the other is two-dimensional, such as steles. Some of the carvings on steles are intaglio, and some are relief carvings, which can be called relief sculpture.</p>
<p>Our country has always attached importance to the study of epigraphy, but it is too focused on the textual aspect, and thus the figures in three-dimensional stone carvings and the images in two-dimensional carvings have been neglected. The epigraphy books of the past, even if they described stone carving images, were extremely cursory and did not pay attention to them. Therefore, now is still the best opportunity to study this greatest art of stone carving in our country. This time, the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum is holding an exhibition of sculpture art in our country, which is the first voice of publicity for stone carving art after the victory, and is really worthy of praise. It is a pity that the exhibition venue is not large enough to display large stone paintings, nor is there enough wall space to hang huge and rich stone carving rubbings. The stone carving rubbings produced this time only take one or two percent of a collector's collection, which is really only giving visitors "a taste."</p>
<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</p>
<h3>Ten Years of Bigamy - Taking a Concubine Before Marrying a Wife</h3>
<p>Chi Zhonglong asks me: Twelve years ago, I married Ms. Jia in a simple ceremony. Ten years later, I married Ms. Yi. I would like to ask: (1) Does this situation constitute the crime of bigamy? (2) The latter was with the consent of the parents, and the marriage was done under the name of "concurrent wife." Is this legal? (3) Ms. Jia has known about this for ten years. Does she still have the right to sue? (4) Before the former marriage relationship is dissolved, what is the status of the latter in the family? (5) Is there any legal basis for my intention to first take a concubine (Jia) and then marry (Yi)? (6) Is there any way to remedy my relationship with Ms. Yi? (7) If the crime of bigamy is committed, can anyone sue?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Since a ceremony was held, it certainly constitutes the crime of bigamy. (2) There is no legal basis. (3) An invalid marriage can certainly be sued for cancellation. (4) Cohabitation relationship. (5) If the former marriage relationship is indeed non-existent, the latter can naturally be regarded as the formal spouse. (6) Bigamy is not only not legally protected, but should also be punished by law. (7) Not only can the parties involved sue, but others can also report it.</p>
