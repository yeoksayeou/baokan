<p>共軍陣綫後面之小店仍照常營業，由於紙幣缺乏，生意淸呆，麵包價格較北平低百分之二十。政府之貨幣，在共軍區內仍繼續流通，燕京大學之電力，共軍仍予供給。一共軍政工人員稱：假如電綫恢復，共軍願意供應北平電流。毫無問題地，此話含有宣傳用意。記者個人之影象爲：假如傅作義將軍之勇敢善戰之內蒙騎兵與林彪之部隊發生激烈之大戰，則北平之美麗景色將成血色，北平許多宮殿，廟宇及公園將被燬壞，此對世界乃不可彌補之損失。許多華方人士不相信共軍將不顧國內外之譴責，冒險向故都轟擊。</p>

<h3 id="c22">東方聯盟的醞釀 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>英澳官員近鑒於亞洲危機的日益嚴重，紛紛倡議東亞各國應組織一類似西歐聯盟的國際機構，以抵抗及防制共產勞力的席捲整個亞洲。據合衆社二十五日倫教電稱：英澳直接關心於遠東局勢發展之官員，因爲看到蘇聯勢力在東方的迅速的發展，故力言東亞亦需要一類似西歐聯盟的組織以抵抗侵略。他們所持的理由是：中國勢將分裂，孫院長也巳聲明，中國政府將考慮與中共媾和，過去對於統一的中國認爲可以構成一反共堡壘之觀念，也巳粉碎無餘了。所以分裂的中國將使中共控制北方的資源，使其視綫逐漸指向香港；加以馬來亞，緬甸，以及印尼最近之發展，使吾人對於亞洲赤化的憂懼，亦將成爲眼前的事實了。</p>
<p>英澳官員對於亞洲局勢的看法是相當正確的，他們對於亞洲前途所懷的憂懼，並不是杞人憂天的，他們所提出的主張組織東亞聯盟以抵抗侵略也是賢明的。但可惜以時機而論，却不免有失之過晚之誤。因爲所謂「遠東防共的聯合陣綫」，以及所謂「亞洲馬歇爾計劃」，在亞洲各國人民聽來，早已耳熟能詳，而且聯合國亞洲及遠東區經濟委員會於本月初在澳洲拉布斯東城開會時，印度代表台賽也曾在會議席上大聲疾呼，要求英美速在亞洲實施類似歐洲復興計劃之亞洲馬歇爾計劃，爲何英美代表竟充耳不聞呢？尤其他們將犯的錯誤，就是以爲不妨待中國赤化了，再來組織東方聯盟以對付未來赤化的中國！</p>
<p>我們必須知道：東方聯盟在英澳兩國的鼓吹之下即使能見諸事責，但求共能够爲抵抗侵略防制赤化的有效機構，應有兩個先決條件：</p>
<p>第一，東方聯盟沒有中國參加在內，就絕無意義可言。試打開亞洲的地圖，中國在地理上的重要性，是誰都不能忽視的。在第二次大戰之中，美國對日作戰所以能轉敗爲勝，中國的堅苦抗戰始終不屈，實爲具有決定性的因素之一。即至戰後，世人努力締造世界和平，亦莫不承認中國在亞洲地位的重要。亞洲在聯合國安全理事會中，也只有一個中國是常任理事國，一方面固然顯示出中國對於亞洲和平所負的責任特別重大，另一方面也可由此看出中國所處地位的重要。亞洲任何間題的協商，如果沒有中國參加在內，就無法覓致解決方案；尤其是關於整個亞洲安危的區域安全機構，更不可無中國的參加。但很奇怪的，我們看了英澳倡議東方聯盟的動機，似欲置中國於聯盟之外。故我們可以斷言，東方聯盟的倡議，如沒有中國參加在內，決不會有什麼成就！這一層意義，必爲英澳官員所深知，在倡議東方聯盟之初，千萬不能忽視此一事實。</p>
<p>第二，亞洲的復興非有美國的全力援助，是不會成功的。第二次大戰之前，亞洲各國大半是西方的殖民地，不論是她的工商業或其他方面，都比較落後，但經過第二次大戰血的洗禮之後，一方面受了世界潮流的激動，另一方面由於民族意識的覺醒，相繼要求獨立，自由，統一，解放，以致在大戰之後，造成一片動亂的現象，從東北亞的朝鮮起，一直到東南亞的印尼，幾乎沒有一塊安樂土。戰亂，饑餓，寒冷，使亞洲人民生活於水深火熱之中。故欲謀亞洲的復興，則非有取得美國的全力援助不可。誠如印度代表台賽氏所說。。「如若亞洲沒有類似西歐復與計劃的馬歇爾計劃，則共產主義在亞洲終必獲得整個的勝利！」準此而論，英澳倡議東方聯盟，若欲成爲事實，則非取得美國的贊助或默許不可。</p>
<p>要之，英澳的建議，在原則上我們固所贊同，但仍希望英澳的外交家能正視亞洲的現實，作通盤的打算，切不可短視，只知替自己打算，而忘了整個的亞洲。爲今之計，如欲促成東方聯盟的實現，則在積極方面，應向世界與情强調援華的重要；在消極方面，應即停止製造亞洲的亂源，尤應勸告荷蘭速即下令停戰。</p>

<p>（四）（問）倘若共產黨在美國取得政權，那將發生何種情况呢？（答）美國的首都，將自華盛頓移至莫斯科。每一個男人，女人，及兒童，均將身受共產黨的嚴格約束。</p>

<p>（十）（問）到那時候，我能不能擁有我自己的房屋呢？（答）不能的，在共產主義制度下，無論在城市或鄉間的一切不動產，均歸政府所有，轉爲共產黨所把持。你的居所是被派定的，而且你必須照所規定的，付給房租。</p>

<p>（二四）（問）共產黨不是對窮苦的人們允許較好的生活嗎？（答）全世界共產黨政客用盡方法，去打破現有的國家，希冀在紊亂中取得政權。口是心非，是人類歷史中的花樣，在共產黨執政的國家中，共產黨的諾言，與共產黨的行爲之間，請作一比較”</p>
<p>（二五）（問）共產黨諾言與共產黨行爲之間，有何種差別呢？（答）當共產黨謀圖攫取政權時候，允諾多的新給，少的工作，以保障免受戰爭與窮苦災難的安全，在實際上，共產黨並未做出此種任何工作，不諭是否在世界那個地方。</p>
<p>（二六）（問）但共產黨不是允諾消除種族與宗敎的褊狹嗎？（答）是的，但實際上由於宗敎與種族的關係，共產黨曾殘殺了千萬的人民，在共產主義制度下，你的種族將對你亳無帮助，宗敎信仰，只有使你遭到殺害。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華慶頓廿六日電〕全國計劃協會頃公佈聲明一項，列舉美國外交政策之長期目標，並認爲美國負責支持自由一點，並無錯誤。該協會係一超然不以營利爲目的之組織，其組成份子爲美國農工商自由職業各界領袖。其關於美國政策之意見，係向公衆提出作爲參攷。該協會在其外交政策聲明中，强調「美國之最後目標，爲繁榮滋長之世界社會中之自由與和平。」</p>
<p>協會稱，目前之世界不如不戰，此時此種外交政策所遭受之危險須加預防。反對共產主義者並不一定對自由具極端熱誠。「儘爲共產主義之反對者西班牙獨裁者·德國偽裝之納粹·貝爾格勒獨倡異議之共黨並不具備獲得美國支持之條件。」美國人不可因目前之策略而忽視整個大計，從而有損於最後目標。美國外交政策各項步驟，最後必須以其對於自由與和平之貢獻，量度其功罪。</p>
<p>外交政策　九項綱領</p>
<p>該協會列舉美國外交政策之主要目標九項；（一）吾等鄭重說明美國之最後目標，卽爲世界之自由與和平，俾日益趨於繁榮。自由者，意卽承認個人之最高重要性。自由社會卽須使個人在感覺上與事實上享有自由。（二）對自由之爭取，必須繼續進行。惟有在自由國家團體係屬切實存在之情形下，此種爭取自虫始能成功。美國爲維護其本身之自由，故必須維護他人之目由。凡屬自由國家必須獲得充份之保證，卽美國不能充份腹行其責任，努力於自由之維護，其他國家亦必須隨時明瞭此點。美國爲履行此項實任時，其中實應包括多少軍事援助在內，此點務必早日加以決定。吾人不應認爲問題係純屬軍事性質或主要係屬軍事性質者。舉例言之，歐洲卽有若干國家，苟其資源過份用諸軍事目的方面，不但不足以促進安全，而反足以遷怒之。美國所作之援助如偏於軍事方面，將不若裝運食物與給予民間經濟所需之援助爲有效。（三）「目下享有自由制度並設法鼓動爭取自由之國，必須有一組織並相互發生關係，藉使其經濟·生活水準·與生活方式，得以作穩定與有秩序之擴充。西歐在經濟與政治上之最密切結合，必須獲得美國一切可能之鼓勵，西歐之有效團結，仍須爲各地人民之最後目標，努力加以支持。（四）美國政策旣以個人之自由爲目標，故對於主張或實行壓迫之人，決不能與之妥協。反對一種壓迫之方法者，並不能作爲致力於自由之證明。此秘便宜主義之代價，對於美國之道德地位，極易成爲一種不能挽回之損害。」（五）關於國內之自由，亦必須遵守同樣嚴格之原則。由於敎育欠佳，貧窮及種族歧視所造成之剝奪自由，必須繼續奮鬥予以消除。吾人尤其須防止退縮。在緊張時期內，往往容易以刪减個人之自由視爲合理。此種作爲，將犧牲美國所負實保衛之價值。（六）自由不能與責任分離。在緊張之世界中領袖階級所負之責任，極爲重大，恐非美國人民所能瞭解。孤立主義之代價之一，爲對於國內敵人，往往較之對於國外敵人更爲重視。爲覓取國內之政治利益起見，不惜犧牲國家之利益或威望。在此上下文中，對友好國家之必要援助，可能被指爲「出賣美國」，而其發起人之動機或甚至愛國精神，亦可被非難。同樣，經由稅則·配額·及禁運，以犧牲對別國之友誼而換取有限之國內利益，此等態度與行動不再能加以容忍。（七）自由與一種特殊形式之經濟組織聯繫與否，均無不可。但信仰個人自由之人，對於國家在經濟事務中之地位，其觀念元全不同。美國政策一部份之戰略，必須承觀它人亦可能不錯，例如，西歐民主社會主義之合理，不下於美國之民主資本主義。（八）目由國家現擁有世界大部分之資源，（尤以未開發之資源爲甚）此點甚足引以爲幸。美國之重要戰略目標，仍係充分發展並利用此種資源·（九）美國必須向世界說明：自由國家之集團並不閉關自守，排斥他人，任何一國尊重個人自由並渴望和平者皆可加入。美國政策之最終目的，厥爲不斷擴大之自由國家集團。協會著名會員簽字之聲明上，有協會主席阿姆辛基宋尼公司總經理，美國投資公司總經理阿爾杜契爾，經合總署勞工參議哥爾登，美國農莊聯合會主席克林，著名雜誌編輯茂飛，美國公誼服務委員會秘書庇克特，梅西公司董事長魯爾。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第入次大會，於昨日上午九時五十分在塘沽路該會會所隆重揭幕，出席潘議長·徐副議長·及參議員一五九人。列席者吳市長·警備司令陳大慶·市黨部方主委·市府各局處長·及來賓查良鑑·倪　·陶百川·金龍章·魏汝霖等三十餘人。潘議長致開幕詞後，吳市長·陳司令·等相繼致詞。末由參議員代表童行白致答詞。開幕典禮至十一時半告成。預定之第一次會議，因時間不及，延至今日下午三時舉行，將由吳市長作施政報告及參議員質詢與答覆。大會開始，首由潘議長致開會詞稱；時光眞快，今天又是本會召開第入次大會的日期了．猶憶第七次大會在九月間開會時，正值幣制改革之初，限價政策雷厲風行，曾幾何時，因中央的財經政策，一改再改，以致國家財源，社會富力，受了很大影響。至戡亂的軍事情况，則由東北以及濟南之國軍撤守，經過徐蚌會戰，演變至於今日，華東則相持於淮河南北，華北則交鋒於平津郊野，大局之嚴重，社會之浮動，當更非三個月以前可比。</p>
<p>目前的上海市，與主力戰塲祗長江一水之隔，幾已面臨前綫，而非復所謂後方。此時此地，吾人集會一堂，深信回人必都其有警覺，也必能舍其瑣屑的小事，而集中精力，以討論幾個挽救危局的大案。環顧全國大局與本市近况，公展謹就個人感想所及，略舉一二抽象之點，就敎於各位長官與同人。至於如何實現我們的期望，却有待於本會同人的縝密討論了。</p>
<h3 id="c73">人民代表當自審責任之重　盡一切力量挽救難危局面 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>就大局言：自中共發動武裝叛變以來，演變至今，幾使大半個中國龍軍在硝烟砲火愁雲慘霧之中。當三年前政府與中共代表會談及以後政治協商會議時，政府未始不渴求和平，而竟因中共固執己見，終於失敗，雖以馬歇爾將軍之好意調停，亦終苦無能爲力，以致空前浩刦，愈演愈烈。最近孫院長就職之前夕，復以「繼續作戰以迄獲得光榮和平」爲言，然而中共氣燄囂張，絕無反應，料必依然憑恃其殘酷的「人海戰術」，毒辣的「謠言攻勢」，以爲終可控制整個的中國，毀滅寶貴的文化，而達其牽入「鐵幕」之目的。和平原是雙方面的事，中共的態度旣如此，哀吾同胞，其願仍爲中共製造戰爭所犧牲的芻狗，而絲亳不想自拔的方法嗎？然而國家是人民所共有的，人民是國家的主人，到了今天這樣生死存亡的緊急關頭，吾人民還不挺身而出，充分發揮我們自己的主權，保障我們自已的生命，維護我們目己的自由，對此戰爭慘禍，只知袖手旁觀，或只是倉皇逃避，始終讓那些蓄意爭奪政權的野心家，殘民以逞，好像國家就是他們少數人所有的一樣，那麼我們固然沒有做國家主人的資格，而光榮的和平亦必渺不可得。一</p>
<p>但是，中華民國今天還是民國呀，我們做入民的，實在佔着祟高的地位，有着潛在的大力，尤其做人民代表的，更當自審其責任之重，自發其慈悲之願，善用我們的一切力量，千廻百折，堅苦卓絕，挽救艱危局面，遏制殘酷的暴力，庶幾可以出水火，登衹席，自救而救國。</p>
<p>上海與中國</p>
<p>就本市言：上海是中國最大都市，擁有六百萬人口，工商輻輳，敎育發達，它的過去現在和未來，對於中國以及全世界的關係，所處地位的電要，人人知道，母庸多說。近百年來，中國多少次救國運動，或由上海發動，而獲得全國響應，或由他處發動，因得到上海的熱烈資助而大功告成。尤其每當天災人禍，哀鴻遍野之時，救死扶傷，往往倡導於上海。每當兵迎禍結，呻吟憔悴之際，恢復統一和平的努力，也往往成就於上海，這種事例，自更不煩列舉。居住於上海的，不獨是中國人，還有很多很久經商傳敎於此的各國僑民，上海之所以有今天，中國人民與友邦僑民都曾有一番心血和力量。要建設一個富强康樂的中國，必需一個元整繁榮的上海，要希望一個和平自由的世界，也必需一個完整繁榮的上海。如果讓上海毀滅了，中國的建設與復興固然艱難萬倍，就是世界的和平與自由，也必然感到極大的損失。所以愛護上海，保全上海，是全中國人民的責任，全世界人士的義務，而上海市民應該盡力的地方必然獨多。</p>
<h3 id="c74">救上海即是救國家 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>因此，公展願乘本會開會廣播之時，要奉勸我們全市的同胞，大家來合力救上海。救上海，就是救國家，救世界，也就是救自己的每一個人，而旁觀與逃避決不是好辦法。我們今天做上海市民的，要有一種自信，有一種豪氣，有一種犧牲自己救助大衆的宏願，大家團結起來，爲地方的社會安全而服務，爲人民的自由生活而盡力，爲國家民族的獨立生存而奮鬥，堅忍不拔，勇猛精進，敢信必能轉移全國的風氣，獲得友邦的援助，使我們的上海，我們的中國，得以渡過此苦難的一關而屹然無恙。</p>
<h3 id="c75">保全上海　必先保全中國 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>現在有許多人都在問，上海怎樣可以保全，他們甚至只想寄希望於友邦，其實公展很誠懇的奉告大家，保全上海的必須靠我們上海市民自己的努力，保全中國的也必須靠我們中國人民自己的奮鬥。這不是說我們不盼望友邦的同情與援助，正惟其希望人助，尤須先行自助。而且，我們要保全上海，必須以保全中國爲大目的，中國如不能保全，則保全上海有何意義。反之，如以保全上海爲其努力的基點，擴而大之，以達成保全中國的任務，上海市民在此階段所貢獻的才眞是偉大。本會此次大會，應該悉心研討，如何增强上海的自衛力量，如何維持上海的社會秩序，如何使全市警察能够飽食暖衣而忠誠服務，如何使軍隊在軍民</p>
<h3 id="c76">請願兩起 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會昨接請願案二起，（一）豫園攤販聯誼會，爲舊花布業公會爭奪桂花廳攤基事，請參議會救濟以維市產案。（二）大束門警廳路集賢村三十弄全體房客代表，因海陸空糾察隊隊員强佔房屋，並趕走房客事，請予制止案。由參議員黃振世趙公望分別接談。合作之前提下有良好的軍風紀，俾土兵眞能保護人民，人民確能尊敬士兵，如何儲備上海的充分糧食，如何使上海的工廠都能够照常生產而不增加失業，如何使流離失所的難民與流亡學生能受到相當的救濟，如何使傷殘官兵有良好的醫療與看護，而稍减其痛苦，凡此種種，都是要保全上海，在目前所必須共同努力的幾件事。總之，我們要保全上海，我們必須有錢出錢，有力出力，我們務須大澈大悟，來救上海，救國家。</p>
<h3 id="c77">吳市長貢獻三句話　以自衛求安全　以安定求繁榮　以堅定求勝利 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>吳市長致詞：略謂本人今日謹以三句話貢獻於參議員諸公：（一）要以自衛求安全。目前上海的公私文武機關，一致企求安定，但是逃避現實決非謀取安定之道，我們必須發揮全力，要以自衛求安定。（二）要以安定求繁榮。年關卽屆，工商界一片凋零氣象，工人感到生活程度高漲，資方却已覺不勝負担，而商店營業一蹶不振，欲求繁榮，必須先謀得安定。（三）要以堅定求取榮譽的和平。本人所說的和平，是勝利的和平，唯有求得勝利，和平才有望，沒有堅定的信念，決不能得勝，也必定沒有和平。</p>
<p>陳大慶</p>
<p>陳大慶致詞：剛才市長與議長均提出要以自衛求安定，本人認爲自衛必須有組織，須發揮集體的力量才能達到目的。我是上海的新朋友，所能貢獻的也祗是這一點。</p>
<p>倪弼</p>
<p>倪弼致詞。共黨之作亂，雖說是由於國際背景，但却是乘虛而入的。我們不能否認目前政府有貪污荒淫無恥等種種不合理現象的存在，上海更是罪惡的淵藪，而尤以中央駐滬各財政機關爲甚。喧囂一時之揚十公司案件。迄無下文，曾引起不少誤會。僅就報紙所刊戰之各項資料，卽能證實其中確有許多不合法情事存在，如聽其逍遙法外，卽是對不起人民，也必定失去人心。故本人認爲最鞏固之防禦，是屬之於心理上的。一切非法享受及盜取不義之財，均應繩之以法。聖誕前夜之在歡，充分表現了上海人的貧富懸殊，上海參議會是最當正義感的，希望能起領導作用。</p>
<p>查良鑑</p>
<p>查良鑑致詞：在上海這個大都市裏，欲求罪行絕跡是根本不可能的。由於經濟政治及社會的因素，目前在精押中之罪犯達五六千人，這與全市整個人口相比，爲數固不算大，但却是政府很大的負擔。由於國庫拮据，中央曾數次電令設法疏散，但負責治安當局，總設法求取社會安定，一且如將一般有習慣性之罪犯釋放，無疑地將是治安之一大威脅，故本人希望第八次參議會對此」問題，提出加以辯論。</p>
<p>方治</p>
<p>方治致詞：我認爲和謠都是共匪散布的，政府如果妥協，就是上了共匪的當。所謂光榮的和平，就是爭取勝利，妥協就是自殺。但我們要使前方將士及保衛地方軍隊浴血作戰，首須使其飽暖，故慰勞工作是必須盡力進行的，希望參議會能發探最大力量。</p>

<p>末由童行白代表參議員致答辭，略謂：屆此第八次大會開幕之際，得到議長及市長等寶貴啓示，感奮萬狀。我們必須面對現實，求得解決，絕不逃避。我認爲目前亟應解決的有二大問題：（一）經濟方面的，兌金辦法急應改善。其政策之合理與否，影響人民生活甚鉅，政府目前所兌售之黃金，可以說大部份取自上海人，而由於政策之不合理，數十上海人却因擠兌而喪生·可見經濟政策對人民生活及地方治安關係之重大。希望此次參議會中能商討一合理方對，則是本次會議之一大收獲。（二）軍事方面的，雖說軍事支配屬之於當局，人民無法赴前方作戰，但如人人堅守崗位努力間接也可發揮其最大力量，希望參議會能起領導作用，則第入次參議會必有最大的收穫。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sun Ke Announced at a Reception for Legislators: Policy Guidelines Are Being Drafted, Scheduled to Be Presented to the Legislative Yuan on the 31st <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The wartime cabinet, not yet formally established but already operating in practice, has held several informal meetings. Participants include the President and Vice President, as well as the Ministers of National Defense, Transportation, Finance, and Foreign Affairs, and influential cabinet members such as Weng Wenhao, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Lisheng, and Chen Lifu. All important decisions will first be discussed and decided upon by this small group in order to expedite matters.</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 27th] Chairman Song stated to a United Press reporter today: "The report by a certain foreign news agency that the five southern provinces are splitting from the central government in order to oppose communism is clearly false. Since the government is already anti-communist, all anti-communist factions should wholeheartedly support the government; this goes without saying."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 27th] Authoritative sources declared on the 27th: Sun Ke's new cabinet has already begun earnestly discussing the issue of war and peace with President Chiang. Although a final decision has not been reached, the main focus of the new policy has apparently been identified as "continuing the war until an honorable peace is achieved." This new policy of "fighting for peace" is considered a compromise between those who advocate immediately resuming political negotiations and those who advocate fighting to the end until the communist party is completely eliminated. Observers believe that under the new policy, there will be no immediate efforts to reopen peace talks, but rather a wait-and-see approach will be adopted, waiting for an opportune moment.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The policy guidelines of Sun Ke's cabinet, outlining key principles, will be presented to the Legislative Yuan this Friday (the 31st). This policy, beneficial to the country and realistically feasible, is currently being drafted. This was announced by Sun at a tea party held to welcome legislators at 4:00 PM on the 27th. Sun, accompanied by Vice President Wu Tiecheng, held a tea party on the 27th to welcome all legislators. In his impromptu speech, he first stated that he and Vice President Wu were now standing in new positions to welcome their colleagues from the Legislative Yuan. He also mentioned that in this cabinet reshuffle, some positions within the new cabinet were held by members of the Legislative Yuan. He hoped that in the future, the legislative and executive branches could have more understanding and connection with each other in order to revitalize politics. Sun also stated that his decision to form a cabinet was like being drafted into military service. Given the current difficult situation, he should not give too much consideration to personal matters. Sun also asked the legislators to excuse any shortcomings. Vice President Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, also hoping that colleagues in the Legislative Yuan could strengthen their ties with the Executive Yuan in order to collectively support the crisis situation. The new President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian and Liu Jianqun, then gave their thanks. The event ended at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The heads of various ministries and commissions of the new Executive Yuan have successively taken office in recent days.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The newly appointed Minister of Land Administration, Wu Shangying, took office today. In his address to the ministry's staff, Wu emphasized that the equalization of land rights must be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Wu, who also serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived at the ministry to take office at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 27th. Former Minister Wang was absent due to illness. Political Vice Minister Liu Shishun acted as the agent for the transfer. Liu and Ye then accompanied Wu to the auditorium to speak with the ministry's section chiefs and higher personnel, saying: Taking charge of foreign affairs under the current new global situation fills him with apprehension, and he hopes that the ministry's staff will continue to assist in completing the tasks with the same spirit they had when assisting former Minister Wang. He also stated that the establishment of the personnel system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not something that can be accomplished in a day, and that future development will depend on the joint efforts of all colleagues.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] On the evening of the 27th, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs above the rank of senior staff held a potluck supper at the minister's official residence to bid farewell to former Minister Wang. During the dinner, Wang encouraged all participants to continue their established work and assist Wu, who also serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs, in implementing national policies. Wu Tiecheng also told reporters in the afternoon that the personnel system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is already on track, and he does not intend to make many changes. Although both Vice Ministers Liu and Ye have resigned, they are being persuaded to stay. According to reporters, Political Vice Minister Liu Shishun has no intention of working in administration and his intention to resign remains firm. He is expected to be approved in the short term. The vacancy will be filled by Ye Gongchao, the current Permanent Vice Minister, and Zhang Yuanruo, the current Deputy Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, is highly touted for the position of Permanent Vice Minister.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The newly appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce, Liu Weizhi, took office at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 27th. Former Minister Chen Qitian personally handed over the office and introduced Liu to all the ministry's staff and gave a speech. In his speech, Liu announced the four policy guidelines for the future: (1) Regarding industry, he is determined to support the development of private industry, increase production, and ensure that state-owned and private enterprises enjoy equal treatment. (2) Regarding commerce, he emphasizes international trade, promotes exports, and obtains foreign exchange. (3) Regarding mining, he will assist the production of mines in various regions and facilitate transportation. (4) Strengthen administrative efficiency. Enterprises operated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, such as the China Textile Company and the China Tobacco Company, will strive to advance. Liu also stated that although many of the ministry's staff are young party members, he will continue to rely on them and hopes that all colleagues will work with peace of mind.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] After taking office on the 27th, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Liu Weizhi, has appointed Huang Tiezheng as the Chief Secretary of the ministry and Lu Xuezhen as the Director of the General Affairs Department. Both Huang and Lu have arrived at the ministry with Liu to take over their new positions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge of the Far East International Military Tribunal, stated today that he will not accept the appointment as Minister of Judicial Administration in the new Chinese cabinet. It is reported that he has telegraphed this intention to the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke. When meeting with reporters this morning, Mei stated that he was extremely surprised by the new appointment because he was unaware of it beforehand. He only received a telegram from the Chinese government last night urging him to take office. He immediately telegraphed Premier Sun, expressing his inability to accept the new position. He believes that he is not suitable for this position, especially under the current circumstances. Mei is scheduled to leave Japan by ship for Shanghai before the middle of next month, carrying thirty boxes of records and documents from the International Military Tribunal. It is reported that he will spend two or three years translating the judgments of the International Military Tribunal, the dissenting opinions of various judges, and various appendices. He will also write two books, discussing the Tokyo trials from both legal and historical perspectives.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 26th] Li Jishen, regarded as the leader of anti-government groups in Hong Kong, stated on the 26th that Premier Sun Ke sent an envoy to Hong Kong to inquire about peace conditions. Li stated that he told the envoy that there is no basis for equal party negotiations between the KMT and the CCP. He told Sun Ke's envoy that Nanjing must first take practical actions, such as ceasing hostilities, releasing political prisoners, abolishing "repressive laws," and maintaining industrial and commercial institutions. Li also stated that groups in Hong Kong believe that such actions would contribute to a coalition government. He said that there is even a possibility that some people in the Nanjing government will be invited to attend a political consultative conference.

If they are received as scheduled, they can be used for the fishing season next spring.

The policy report by Premier Sun Ke, which has been included in the agenda of the 37th meeting on the 31st, is the last major event of this session.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] Regarding the general budget for the first half of the 38th year, the Executive Yuan has submitted a statement to the Legislative Yuan, explaining that the budget proposed by the previous cabinet under Weng can no longer be applied due to price changes, and the new cabinet has only recently taken office, and its policy guidelines and plans have yet to be determined. Moreover, the new year is approaching, and the second session of the Legislative Yuan is about to end. The preparation and review of the budget cannot be completed in time. Therefore, before the budget is determined, the expenditure for the coming year will be temporarily based on the old budget.</p>
<h3 id="e11">National Troops Launch Fierce Attack on Tanggu, Recapture Xinhe Station and Advance Towards Junliangcheng, Large Numbers of Naval Vessels Reinforce the Tanggu Area <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] The military situation in North China, after two weeks of contact and evolution, has developed into a situation where the National Army is firmly defending the three points of Beiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu. Judging from the military strength of both sides, the focus of the National Army is clearly in Beiping, followed by Tianjin, and then Tanggu. However, the Communist army's military strength is focused on the outskirts of Beiping, followed by Tianjin. In recent days, the seven columns of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen have rushed to the outskirts of Tanggu, with the intention of first occupying this gateway and then slowly plotting for Beiping and Tianjin. For the past few days, Tanggu has been firmly defended by the Youth Army, traffic police, and other units, with the support of the navy and air force, and has not been shaken. The bloody fighting between the two sides is more intense than in Beiping and Tianjin. It is speculated that in order to reverse the declining morale caused by the failure to overcome the defenses, the Communist army will likely adopt its three-stage tactic of "encirclement, approach, and bombardment" to deal with the National Army. According to military news, Huidui and Yangliuqing in the suburbs of Tianjin have been recaptured by National Army troops.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] Military News: Before dawn on the 27th, the National Army in Tanggu launched a fierce attack on the Xinhe Railway Station-Beitang line north of Tanggu. The bandits retreated in panic. The National Army recaptured Xinhe Railway Station and continued to advance towards Junliangcheng. On the line from Honglou to Wanniannan south of Dagu, the 9th Column of the bandits launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 26th, but was ultimately repelled by the combined air and land forces of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] Naval vessels are continuously arriving in Tanggu to reinforce. According to relevant sources, more than sixty large and small vessels have arrived successively on the 25th and 26th, and the situation in Tanggu has changed dramatically.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] There has been no close combat in the Tanggu area. Both sides are busy deploying, and a major battle is about to unfold. After the naval reinforcements arrived, the strength of the National Army was greatly increased. On the morning of the 27th, it began to actively bombard the bandits, putting great pressure on the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 6:30 PM] Semi-official news: A powerful fleet of the National Army arrived along the coast of Tanggu this morning. The ships were equipped with heavy artillery and have already opened fire to assist in the battle. The Communist army attacking Tanggu is showing signs of retreating.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 6:30 PM] The fighting in Tanggu reached its climax from the 26th to the morning of the 27th. The artillery fire from both sides was fierce, and a large number of shells fell into the Hai River. Many civilian houses in the Tanggu area were destroyed. Dagu East and West are still firmly defended by the National Army. The battle on the outskirts of Tianjin is still shrouded in uncertainty, and the National Army is carrying out necessary deployments.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 7:30 PM] Military News: A unit of Lin's bandits launched a fierce attack on the National Army positions on Shandong Road south of Daogou in southwest Dagu, Jiudaogou northeast of Tanggu, and Xinhe Railway Station on the morning of the 26th. The National Army infantry, with the assistance of naval artillery fire, fought fiercely with the bandits all day long. The bandits launched more than ten waves of attacks, suffering more than 3,000 casualties. The fighting subsided at night. This morning, they continued to fight with the bandits at the original positions. The sound of artillery fire in Tanggu was deafening, and the order was good.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The arrival of a strong National Army navy in Tanggu has quickly reversed the tense situation in the Tanggu area, placing the garrison in an extremely advantageous position. It is understood that the number of large and small naval vessels that have arrived in Tanggu in recent days is at least 60. The Supreme Commander, synthesizing the situation on the battlefield, told reporters in an excited and joyful tone that the National Army has now completed all preparations. Our army has dug an unprecedentedly large grave for the bandits. Under these circumstances, we welcome Lin's bandits to come and die.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 6:30 PM] The city defense works of Beiping have been completed after continuous construction in recent days. After 8:00 AM today, the National Army searched the western suburbs, making contact with the bandits in Wanluzhuang, Xiyuan Airport, and the Wanshou Temple area. After a fierce battle until 11:30 AM, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. The battle situation turned quiet.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters issued a statement today regarding the military situation outside Tianjin: (1) The National Army's infantry, cavalry, and artillery units in the suburbs of Beiping launched extensive sweeps in the suburbs in multiple directions and made smooth progress. At 6:00 AM this morning, they launched powerful searches in the areas of Quanggongcun outside Xizhimen, Xiaonanzhuang, Luodaozhuang, Huajiazhuang, Balizhuang, Gongzhufen outside Fuchengmen, and Shifangyuan, Yunhuachi, Caishenmiao, and the northern and southern arcs, 40 li outside Guang'anmen. By 12:00 noon, they had dispersed the scattered bandits and captured all the above-mentioned places, killing and wounding more than 100 bandits. Around 3:00 PM, part of the National Army advanced to Haidian, part continued to search west of Gongzhufen, and another part pursued the bandits in the Baitaan area. (2) There was no change in the military situation on the outskirts of Tianjin. The National Army search and sweep troops extending east and west of Tianjin continued to search in Xiaowangzhuang, Ludong, and Yuzhuangzi west of Tianjin, with only sporadic battles with the bandits.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Huidui Paper Mill on the outskirts of Tianjin, owned by the Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company of the National Resources Commission, is still under the control of the National Army.

<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th] The war has affected the animals and birds in the Beiping Zoo outside Xizhimen. After the war on the outskirts of Beiping began, the zoo staff all evacuated to the city. The remaining monkeys, wolves, cranes, dogs, fish, oxen, etc., cried miserably for several days, but no one paid attention to them. Only one sunflower bird was brought into the city. The rest have probably all starved to death. The little remaining livestock in the zoo have now disappeared.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Personal Account of the Communist Areas on the Outskirts of Beiping, Reported by an Associated Press Reporter <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press Correspondent Leon, Beiping, 27th] The most obvious difference between the National Army defending Beiping and the Communist army besieging it seems to be the hats they wear. The Communist army wears thick, large leather hats, which proves that the Communist army was transferred south from the icy and snowy Northeast. Apart from the leather hats, the National Army and the Communist army have many similarities. Both sides have the same skin color and uniforms, are very young, have good spirits, are equipped with fully automatic weapons, and are very flexible and sensitive. The Communist army political officer whom the reporter met some days ago was the opposite of a typical tight-lipped and suspicious figure, and was very talkative. The first batch of Communist soldiers that the reporter met asked several questions: "Is the reporter an American reporter who is afraid of being regarded as a reactionary and being arrested and shot by the Communist army?" "Are you married?" "Have you been to the Soviet Union?" One Communist soldier pointed to the reporter's coat and asked: "Isn't this American-made?" The reporter replied: "Yes." The Communist soldier picked up an American carbine and said: "This is also American-made."</p>
<p>Small shops behind the Communist army's front line are still operating as usual. Due to the lack of paper money, business is slow. The price of bread is 20% lower than in Beiping. The government's currency continues to circulate in the Communist area. The power of Yenching University is still supplied by the Communist army. A Communist political worker said: "If the power lines are restored, the Communist army is willing to supply Beiping with electricity." Undoubtedly, this statement contains propaganda. The reporter's personal impression is: if General Fu Zuoyi's brave and skilled Inner Mongolian cavalry has a fierce battle with Lin Biao's troops, then the beautiful scenery of Beiping will become bloody, and many palaces, temples, and parks in Beiping will be destroyed. This is an irreparable loss to the world. Many Chinese people do not believe that the Communist army will risk bombarding the ancient capital, regardless of condemnation at home and abroad.</p>

After Yi landed, he also tested the takeoff, and was satisfied with the hardness and length of the runway. For the past two days, flights to Beiping have been hindered by the weather. Today, the sky over Beiping cleared, and the C-46 airlifters have begun to transport members of the educational community south according to the prescribed number.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] The highest military authorities in Tianjin stated today that 40,000 landmines have been buried within ninety li around Tianjin, forming an unparalleled minefield. It will continue to be strengthened in the future. Tianjin has prepared food and coal for half a year, so there is no need to worry about the bandit's encirclement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Chen Changjie, Garrison Commander of Tianjin, announced at the weekly meeting of his unit on the 27th: More than 40,000 landmines have now been buried around Tianjin, and will continue to be strengthened. This measure is not for dead defense, but to control the area with landmines and eliminate the enemy with firepower. Chen also stated: The troops defending Tianjin completed the construction of the inner and outer lines within a few days and repelled the enemy, overcoming the crisis. Due to the calm deployment, the bandits knew that it was difficult to retreat. However, we cannot be complacent because of small victories. We should work harder, be more vigilant, and be prepared to annihilate the bandits at any time. Chen concluded by saying: The productive enterprises in North China, some for thirty or fifty years, and many for sixty or seventy years, are all the achievements of our ancestors' arduous efforts. Everyone should protect them. As for the demolition of houses in Yixingbu and other places on the outskirts of Tianjin, it was caused by the excessive enthusiasm of a small number of troops in defending Tianjin. He deeply regrets this. The refugees in the area have been specially allowed to enter the city defenses and are being assisted by the municipal government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Political Work Office of the Tianjin Garrison Command announced on the 27th: Since the start of the Tianjin defense battle, the number of bandits captured by us is as follows: 139 officers at the regimental level, and 154 privates. As of the 27th, the number of bandits who surrendered with their weapons and have been reported by various units is 3,360. Those who have not yet been reported are being counted.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The snow in the Huaihai war zone stopped on the 27th. Airplanes have been dispatched to airdrop food to support the troops of Du Yuming's army corps. According to a military source, it is imperative to launch airdrops of food to Du's corps and similar beleaguered units. Bread baked by bakeries in major cities like Nanjing and Shanghai, plus cooked beef slices, would be even more suitable for airdropping. If the current mobile warfare is strengthened through control from various aspects, then for the food supply to troops trapped in bandit-controlled areas, innovation must be strived for.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Liu Bocheng and his communist troops seem to have disappeared recently, and the Nationalist generals responsible for defending Nanjing and Shanghai are speculating about their whereabouts.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Military transportation in the capital is frequent today, with more troops arriving than leaving. It is generally believed that the capital will be transformed into a battlefield. Judging from recent troop movements, the Nationalist army seems poised to hold the Nanjing-Shanghai area indefinitely, with the main line of defense set up in Jiangnan, starting from Wuhu in the west and deploying along the railway line. Furthermore, according to news from northern Jiangsu, fierce fighting continues north of Gaoyou.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] According to news from Zhenjiang: Armed village teams are being organized along the Nanjing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways to protect railway bridges and tracks.

<h3 id="e22">The Brewing of an Eastern Alliance <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Recently, British and Australian officials, in light of the increasing severity of the Asian crisis, have been advocating that East Asian countries should organize an international organization similar to the Western European alliance, to resist and prevent the communist labor force from sweeping across the entire Asia. According to a United Press report from London on the 25th: British and Australian officials who are directly concerned about the development of the Far East situation, because they have seen the rapid development of Soviet forces in the East, strongly advocate that East Asia also needs an organization similar to the Western European alliance to resist aggression. The reason they hold is that China is about to split, and President Sun has also declared that the Chinese government will consider making peace with the CCP. The past concept that a unified China could constitute an anti-communist fortress has also been shattered. Therefore, a divided China will allow the CCP to control the resources of the north, gradually turning its gaze toward Hong Kong; coupled with the recent developments in Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, the fear of Asian redification will also become an imminent reality.</p>
<p>The British and Australian officials' view of the Asian situation is quite correct. The fear they have about the future of Asia is not alarmist. The proposal they put forward to organize an East Asian alliance to resist aggression is also wise. But unfortunately, in terms of timing, it is inevitably a mistake to be too late. Because the so-called "Far East anti-communist united front" and the so-called "Asian Marshall Plan" have long been familiar to the people of Asian countries. Moreover, when the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East met in Launceston, Australia, earlier this month, Indian representative Tysoe also shouted loudly at the meeting, demanding that the United Kingdom and the United States quickly implement an Asian Marshall Plan similar to the European Recovery Program in Asia. Why did the British and American representatives turn a deaf ear? In particular, the mistake they will make is to think that they might as well wait for China to be redified before organizing an Eastern Alliance to deal with the future redified China!</p>
<p>We must know that even if the Eastern Alliance can be put into effect under the advocacy of the United Kingdom and Australia, there should be two prerequisites for it to be an effective organization for resisting aggression and preventing redification:</p>
<p>First, the Eastern Alliance is meaningless without China's participation. Open the map of Asia. The geographical importance of China cannot be ignored by anyone. During the Second World War, the reason why the United States was able to turn defeat into victory against Japan was because China's arduous resistance was consistently unyielding, which was a decisive factor. Even after the war, when the world strived to create world peace, it was universally recognized that China's position in Asia was important. In the United Nations Security Council in Asia, only China is a permanent member. On the one hand, it shows that China bears a particularly heavy responsibility for Asian peace. On the other hand, it can also be seen from this the importance of China's position. Any consultation on Asian issues cannot find a solution without China's participation; especially regional security mechanisms related to the safety of the entire Asia, cannot be without China's participation. But strangely, when we look at the motives of the United Kingdom and Australia in advocating the Eastern Alliance, it seems that they want to place China outside the Alliance. Therefore, we can assert that the advocacy of the Eastern Alliance will not have any success without China's participation! This level of significance must be well known to British and Australian officials. At the beginning of advocating the Eastern Alliance, this fact must not be ignored.</p>
<p>Second, the revival of Asia will not succeed without the full assistance of the United States. Before World War II, most of the countries in Asia were colonies of the West. Whether it was her industry and commerce or other aspects, they were relatively backward. However, after the baptism of blood in World War II, on the one hand, they were stimulated by the world trend, and on the other hand, due to the awakening of national consciousness, they successively demanded independence, freedom, unity, and liberation, resulting in a turbulent phenomenon after the war. From Korea in Northeast Asia to Indonesia in Southeast Asia, there is almost no land of peace. War, hunger, and cold have made the people of Asia live in dire straits. Therefore, to seek the revival of Asia, it is necessary to obtain the full assistance of the United States. As Indian representative Tysoe said. "If Asia does not have a Marshall Plan similar to the European Recovery Plan, communism will inevitably win the entire victory in Asia!" Based on this, if the United Kingdom and Australia's advocacy of the Eastern Alliance is to become a reality, it must obtain the support or acquiescence of the United States.</p>
<p>In short, we agree with the suggestions of the United Kingdom and Australia in principle, but we still hope that British and Australian diplomats can face up to the reality of Asia and make comprehensive plans, and must not be short-sighted, only knowing how to plan for themselves, while forgetting the entire Asia. For the present plan, if we want to promote the realization of the Eastern Alliance, then in the active aspect, we should emphasize to the world the importance of aiding China; in the passive aspect, we should immediately stop creating sources of chaos in Asia, and should especially advise the Netherlands to immediately order a ceasefire.</p>

In the 1949 plan, it has been decided to cancel the restrictions and approve them at any time according to actual needs. In addition, the types of export and import goods will also be increased compared to the past.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities, after ten years of research into communism and the American Communist Party, has recently published a booklet in a question-and-answer format, exposing the general situation of communism and the American Communist Party. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) (Q) What is communism? (A) Communism is a system which a small minority uses, hoping to conquer the world.</p>
<p>(2) (Q) Have any countries in the past become communist countries through free elections? (A) No.</p>
<p>(3) (Q) How then do the communists attempt to seize power? (A) They adopt any possible means, whether legal or illegal. The first victory of communism was through a bloody revolution. Since then, every victory of communism has been through military conquest, internal corruption, or related threats. "Conspiracy" is the basic method used by the Communist Party in the countries it attempts to conquer. "Iron pressure" is the basic method used by the Communist Party in the countries it has already conquered.</p>
<p>(4) (Q) If the Communist Party gains power in the United States, what will happen? (A) The capital of the United States will be moved from Washington to Moscow. Every man, woman, and child will be under the strict control of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(5) (Q) Will my life be better then than it is now? (A) Absolutely not. The following seventeen answers will explain everything.</p>
<p>(6) (Q) Can I freely join a labor union then? (A) Under a communist system, all labor unions are run by the government, which is controlled by the Communist Party. At that time, the union will never be able to get you higher wages, shorter working hours, or better working conditions. The Communist Party will only use the union to oppress you.</p>
<p>(7) (Q) Will I be able to change my job then? (A) No, you can only work where you are assigned and receive the wages prescribed by the government.</p>
<p>(8) (Q) Will I be able to go to school then? (A) You can only go to schools prescribed by the Communist Party. You are not free to enter any other school. You can enter any school as long as the Communist Party allows it, and only to that extent. You can only read what the Communist Party allows. You can only hear what they allow. As long as it is within their control, you can only know what they allow you to know.</p>
<p>(9) (Q) Can I join the Elks Club, Rotary Club, or Veterans of Foreign Wars then? (A) No. American Communist Party leader Foster once said: "Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, all capitalist parties—Republican, Democratic, Progressive, Socialist, etc.—will be dissolved, leaving only one Communist Party—the party of the working masses. Similarly, all other groups that are not supporters of bourgeois politics, including chambers of commerce, employers' associations, Rotary Clubs, Veterans of Foreign Wars, YMCA, and various monks and sects, will be dissolved."</p>
<p>(10) (Q) Will I be able to own my own house then? (A) No. Under a communist system, all real estate, whether in cities or in the countryside, is owned by the government and controlled by the Communist Party. Your residence is assigned, and you must pay rent as required.</p>
<p>(11) (Q) Will I be able to own my own land then? (A) No. Under a communist system, the land is the property of the government, which is controlled by the Communist Party. You must farm as prescribed, and you have no right to decide when or where to sell your produce or at what price.</p>
<p>(12) (Q) What will happen to my insurance money then? (A) The Communist Party will take it over.</p>
<p>(13) (Q) What will happen to my savings in the bank then? (A) Amounts above a very small figure will be confiscated, and the remainder will be controlled.</p>
<p>(14) (Q) When I die then, can I leave any property to my family? (A) No, because you will not have any property to leave.</p>
<p>(15) (Q) Will I be able to travel freely within the country then? (A) No, your every movement must be approved by the police station in advance.</p>
<p>(16) (Q) Can I join a church then? (A) In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party has used every means to destroy religion for the past thirty years. Since they have failed in this regard, they are now using religion from within. The Communist Party is now applying this same strategy in the United States.</p>
<p>(17) (Q) Can I start a business and hire people to work for me then? (A) Doing so will be a crime, and you will be severely punished.</p>
<p>(18) (Q) Can I teach what I like to teach in an atmosphere of "academic freedom" then? (A) You can only teach everything that the Communist Party orders you to teach. If you have any other intentions, you are simply courting destruction or imprisonment.</p>
<p>(19) (Q) Can I freely conduct scientific research without government interference or restrictions then? (A) Police and detectives will watch your every move. If you are found to be doing anything that violates orders, you will be liquidated.</p>
<p>(20) (Q) Can I freely make friends then? (A) No, you can only make friends with those approved by the Communist Party. From birth to death, your life is controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(21) (Q) Can I travel abroad or marry a foreigner then? (A) You cannot take such action unless with the permission of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(22) (Q) Can I correspond with friends in other countries then? (A) You may try it under postal and telecommunications censorship—and only try it once.</p>
<p>(23) (Q) Can I vote to remove the Communist Party then? (A) Please examine the political achievements of the Communist Party in other countries and the fact that communism is taking effect within the U.S. government, and you will find that it is impossible.</p>
<p>(24) (Q) Does the Communist Party not promise a better life for the poor? (A) Communist politicians around the world use every means to break down existing countries, hoping to seize power in the chaos. Hypocrisy is a trick in human history. In countries ruled by the Communist Party, please compare the promises of the Communist Party with the actions of the Communist Party."</p>
<p>(25) (Q) What is the difference between the promises of the Communist Party and the actions of the Communist Party? (A) When the Communist Party seeks to seize power, it promises high wages, less work, and security to protect against war and the disasters of poverty. In reality, the Communist Party has not done any of these things, whether it is in any part of the world.</p>
<p>(26) (Q) But doesn't the Communist Party promise to eliminate racial and religious intolerance? (A) Yes, but in fact, because of religion and race, the Communist Party has massacred tens of millions of people. Under a communist system, your race will not help you in the slightest, and religious belief will only cause you to be killed.</p>

<p>[Our Report] New York, 27th Broadcast, Batavia News: An Indonesian secret radio station broadcast that guerilla warfare has occurred in eastern Java. Indonesian troops attacked Dutch troops with swift action, and then fled. Indonesian military commander Songkono in eastern Java ordered troops in various locations to implement a "hit and run" tactic.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 27th Broadcast: The Security Council held a meeting today. The Dutch government told the Security Council that it has released fourteen Indonesian political prisoners, but refused to explain whether this action was in accordance with the Security Council's ceasefire order. The Dutch government also announced that most Indonesian Republic officials will be moved from Java to other locations. Last Friday, the Security Council requested the Dutch government to release the captured Indonesian officials. The Dutch Overseas Colonial Department said that Republic officials will be temporarily moved to several mountainous areas outside Java, but did not specify who the officials involved were. Also, the Dutch cabinet gathered for a long time on the morning of the 27th, but still did not announce whether it would abide by the Security Council's ceasefire order after the meeting. However, the general public in the Netherlands did not attach importance to the suspension of funds by the ECA. Although they recognized this as a major blow to the Dutch economy, they firmly believed that the United States would never want the Indonesian Communist Party to succeed.</p>

<h3 id="e71">The Ultimate Goal of US Foreign Policy: Seeking Freedom and Peace for the World; Anti-Communism without Inclination towards Freedom Cannot Obtain US Aid <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] The National Planning Association recently published a statement outlining the long-term goals of US foreign policy and asserting that there is no error in the US responsibility to support freedom. The Association is a non-partisan, non-profit organization whose members are leaders from the US agricultural, industrial, commercial, and professional sectors. Its opinions on US policy are presented to the public as reference. In its foreign policy statement, the Association emphasized that "America's ultimate goal is freedom and peace in a thriving world society."</p>
<p>The Association stated that the current world is not as good as being at peace, and the dangers faced by this type of foreign policy must be prevented. Those who oppose Communism are not necessarily extremely enthusiastic about freedom. "Dictatorships such as Spain, Nazis in disguise in Germany, and the dissident Communists in Belgrade, who are merely opponents of Communism, do not qualify for US support." Americans must not ignore the overall plan due to current strategies, thereby damaging the ultimate goal. Each step of US foreign policy must ultimately be measured by its contribution to freedom and peace.</p>
<p>Foreign Policy: Nine Principles</p>
<p>The Association listed nine main goals of US foreign policy: (1) We solemnly declare that the ultimate goal of the United States is freedom and peace in the world, so that it will become increasingly prosperous. Freedom means recognizing the supreme importance of the individual. A free society must allow individuals to enjoy freedom in feeling and in fact. (2) The pursuit of freedom must continue. This pursuit can only be successful when a community of free nations is truly in existence. In order to maintain its own freedom, the United States must maintain the freedom of others. All free nations must receive full assurance that the United States cannot fully fulfill its responsibilities and strive to maintain freedom, and other countries must also understand this point at all times. When the United States fulfills this responsibility, it must include the amount of military aid it should include, which must be decided as soon as possible. We should not regard the problem as purely military in nature or primarily military in nature. For example, there are some countries in Europe that, if their resources are used excessively for military purposes, will not only fail to promote security, but may even provoke resentment. US assistance, if biased towards military aspects, will not be as effective as shipping food and providing assistance to the civilian economy. (3) "Countries that currently enjoy free systems and seek to encourage the pursuit of freedom must have an organization and interact with each other so that their economies, living standards, and lifestyles can be expanded in a stable and orderly manner. The closest possible economic and political integration of Western Europe must receive all possible encouragement from the United States. The effective unity of Western Europe must still be supported as the ultimate goal of the people everywhere. (4) Since the goal of US policy is the freedom of the individual, it can never compromise with those who advocate or practice oppression. Opposing one method of oppression cannot be used as proof of dedication to freedom. The price of this expedient is very likely to become an irreparable damage to the moral status of the United States." (5) The same strict principles must be observed regarding domestic freedom. The deprivation of freedom caused by poor education, poverty, and racial discrimination must continue to be eliminated. We must especially prevent regression. During times of tension, it is often easy to view the reduction of individual freedom as reasonable. This will sacrifice the values ​​that the United States is responsible for protecting. (6) Freedom cannot be separated from responsibility. The responsibility of leaders in a tense world is extremely important and may not be understood by the American people. One of the costs of isolationism is that domestic enemies are often valued more than foreign enemies. For the sake of domestic political interests, the interests or prestige of the country are sacrificed. In this context, necessary assistance to friendly countries may be labeled as "selling out America," and the motives or even patriotism of the initiator may be criticized. Similarly, attitudes and actions such as sacrificing friendship with other countries in exchange for limited domestic interests through tariffs, quotas, and embargoes can no longer be tolerated. (7) Freedom is not necessarily linked to a particular form of economic organization. However, those who believe in individual freedom have completely different ideas about the state's position in economic affairs. Part of the strategy of American policy must be to acknowledge that others may also be right. For example, the reasonableness of Western European democratic socialism is no less than that of American democratic capitalism. (8) It is fortunate that free countries now possess most of the world's resources (especially undeveloped resources). The important strategic goal of the United States remains to fully develop and utilize these resources. (9) The United States must explain to the world that the group of free countries is not closed off and excludes others. Any country that respects individual freedom and desires peace can join. The ultimate goal of US policy is a constantly expanding group of free countries. The statement signed by prominent members of the association includes Association Chairman Mr. Amusingki, President of Sony Corporation, Mr. Ardutchel, General Manager of American Investment Corporation, Mr. Golden, Labor Counselor of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Mr. Kling, President of the American Farm Union, Mr. Moufei, editor of the famous magazine, Mr. Beckett, secretary of the American Quaker Service Committee, and Mr. Luer, chairman of Macy's Corporation.</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Inauguration of the Eighth General Assembly of the First Session of the Municipal Council; The Speaker Loudly Appeals: Save Shanghai, Save the Country; The Battlefield is Only a River Away; Major Rescue Cases Awaiting Discussion; The First Meeting will be Held this Afternoon <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Eighth General Assembly of the First Session of the Municipal Council was solemnly inaugurated at 9:50 AM yesterday at the council's headquarters on Tanggu Road. The speaker, Mr. Pan, the deputy speaker, Mr. Xu, and 159 councilors attended. Mayor Wu, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, Party Committee Chairman Fang, directors of various municipal bureaus, and guests Cha Liangjian, Ni Bi, Tao Baichuan, Jin Longzhang, Wei Rulin, and others, totaling more than 30 people, were present. After Speaker Pan delivered the opening speech, Mayor Wu, Commander Chen, and others delivered speeches successively. Finally, Councilor Tong Xingbai delivered a response. The opening ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM. The scheduled first meeting was postponed to 3:00 PM this afternoon due to lack of time. Mayor Wu will deliver a policy report and councilors will ask questions and provide answers. At the beginning of the conference, Speaker Pan delivered an opening speech, saying: Time flies so fast. Today is the date for our council to convene its Eighth General Assembly. I still remember when the Seventh General Assembly was held in September, it was at the beginning of the currency reform, and the price limit policy was vigorously implemented. However, due to the central government's financial policies, which have been changed again and again, the country's financial resources and social wealth have been greatly affected. As for the military situation in the suppression of the rebellion, the national army has withdrawn from the Northeast and Jinan. After the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, it has evolved to this day. In East China, the two sides are facing each other north and south of the Huai River. In North China, the two sides are fighting in the suburbs of Pingjin. The seriousness of the overall situation and the volatility of society are even more incomparable to three months ago.</p>
<p>The current city of Shanghai is only separated from the main battlefield by the Yangtze River, and it is almost facing the front line, rather than the so-called rear. At this time and in this place, we are gathered together. I firmly believe that everyone must be alert, and they must put aside their trivial matters and concentrate their efforts to discuss several major cases to save the critical situation. Looking at the overall situation of the country and the recent situation of the city, I, Gongzhan, would like to briefly mention one or two abstract points based on my personal feelings and teach them to the officials and colleagues. As for how to realize our expectations, it is up to the meticulous discussion of the colleagues of this council.</p>
<h3 id="e73">People's Representatives Should Examine the Importance of Their Responsibilities and Do Everything Possible to Save the Difficult and Dangerous Situation <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>In terms of the overall situation: Since the CCP launched an armed rebellion, it has evolved to this day, almost making most of China's dragon army in the smoke of gunfire, sorrow, and mist. When the government and CCP representatives held talks three years ago and the Political Consultative Conference afterward, the government did not start without longing for peace, but it failed due to the CCP's stubborn adherence to its own views. Even General Marshall's goodwill mediation was ultimately unable to do anything, leading to an unprecedented catastrophe that has become increasingly fierce. Recently, on the eve of President Sun's inauguration, he said "continue to fight until a glorious peace is achieved." However, the CCP's arrogance is rampant and there is no response. It is expected that it will still rely on its brutal "human wave tactics" and poisonous "rumor offensive," believing that it can ultimately control the entire China, destroy the precious culture, and achieve its goal of dragging it into the "Iron Curtain." Peace is originally a two-way thing. The CCP's attitude is like this, alas my compatriots, are they still willing to be sacrificed as straw dogs for the war created by the CCP, and do they not want to find a way to extricate themselves? However, the country is owned by the people, and the people are the masters of the country. At this critical juncture of life and death, why don't we, the people, stand up, fully exert our own sovereignty, protect our own lives, maintain our own freedom, and just stand by and watch this war catastrophe, or just flee in a panic, and always let those ambitious people who deliberately seize power and kill the people to their heart's content, as if the country belongs to only a few of them. Then we are certainly not qualified to be the masters of the country, and the glorious peace must be unattainable.</p>
<p>However, the Republic of China is still the Republic of China today. We, the people, are really occupying a lofty position and have a latent great power. Especially the people's representatives should examine the importance of their responsibilities, spontaneously develop their compassionate wishes, make good use of all our strength, and go through all kinds of twists and turns, with perseverance and extraordinary efforts, to save the difficult and dangerous situation and curb the brutal violence, so that we can escape from the fire and ascend to the throne, saving ourselves and saving the country.</p>
<p>Shanghai and China</p>
<p>In terms of the city: Shanghai is the largest city in China, with a population of six million, with a concentration of industry and commerce, and developed education. Everyone knows the importance of its past, present, and future relationship with China and the world, and there is no need to say more. In the past hundred years, many national salvation movements in China have either been launched by Shanghai and received a national response, or launched elsewhere and achieved great success because of the enthusiastic assistance from Shanghai. Especially whenever there are natural and man-made disasters and cries of sorrow are everywhere, saving the dying and healing the wounded is often initiated in Shanghai. Whenever soldiers are welcomed and disasters are concluded, and there are groans and haggardness, the efforts to restore unity and peace are often achieved in Shanghai. These examples need not be listed in detail. Those who live in Shanghai are not only Chinese, but also many foreign nationals who have been doing business and preaching here for a long time. The reason why Shanghai is what it is today is that the Chinese people and foreign friends have put in a lot of effort and strength. To build a strong, prosperous, and happy China, a complete and prosperous Shanghai is necessary. To hope for a peaceful and free world, a complete and prosperous Shanghai is also necessary. If Shanghai is destroyed, China's construction and revival will certainly be a thousand times more difficult, and the peace and freedom of the world will inevitably feel a great loss. Therefore, loving Shanghai and preserving Shanghai is the responsibility of all Chinese people and the obligation of people all over the world, and the Shanghai citizens must do their best to contribute in more ways.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Saving Shanghai is Saving the Country <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, I, Gongzhan, would like to take advantage of the broadcast of this conference to advise our compatriots in the city to work together to save Shanghai. Saving Shanghai is saving the country, saving the world, and saving every individual. Standing by and fleeing are definitely not good ways. Today, we, as citizens of Shanghai, must have a kind of self-confidence, a kind of heroism, and a kind of great ambition to sacrifice ourselves to help the masses. Let us unite, serve for the local social security, do our best for the people's free life, and strive for the independence and survival of the nation and the nation. With perseverance and bravery, we dare to believe that we can change the atmosphere of the whole country and obtain the assistance of friendly countries, so that our Shanghai, our China, can pass through this difficult stage and stand firm.</p>
<h3 id="e75">To Preserve Shanghai, We Must First Preserve China <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Now many people are asking how Shanghai can be preserved. They even want to pin their hopes on friendly countries. In fact, I, Gongzhan, sincerely tell everyone that the preservation of Shanghai must rely on the efforts of our own Shanghai citizens, and the preservation of China must also rely on the struggle of our own Chinese people. This is not to say that we do not hope for the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries. It is precisely because we hope for human assistance that we must first help ourselves. Moreover, to preserve Shanghai, we must take preserving China as our main goal. If China cannot be preserved, what is the meaning of preserving Shanghai? Conversely, if we take preserving Shanghai as the starting point of our efforts and expand it to achieve the task of preserving China, the contribution of Shanghai citizens at this stage will truly be great. This conference of the Council should carefully study how to enhance Shanghai's self-defense capabilities, how to maintain Shanghai's social order, how to ensure that the city's police can eat well and dress warmly and serve loyally, how to ensure that the military has good military discipline under the premise of cooperation between the military and civilians, so that the soldiers can truly protect the people, and the people can truly respect the soldiers, how to reserve sufficient food for Shanghai, how to enable Shanghai's factories to continue production as usual without increasing unemployment, how to enable displaced refugees and exiled students to receive considerable relief, how to enable wounded and disabled officers and soldiers to have good medical care and nursing, and slightly reduce their suffering. All of these are several things that must be worked on together to preserve Shanghai at the present time. In short, to preserve Shanghai, we must contribute money and effort. We must have a great awakening to save Shanghai and save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Mayor Wu Contributes Three Sentences: Seeking Security through Self-Defense, Seeking Prosperity through Stability, and Seeking Victory through Determination <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech: I would like to contribute three sentences to the councilors: (1) Seek security through self-defense. At present, all public and private civil and military institutions in Shanghai are seeking stability, but escaping reality is definitely not a way to seek stability. We must exert all our strength to seek stability through self-defense. (2) Seek prosperity through stability. The end of the year is approaching, and the industrial and commercial sectors are in a state of decline. Workers feel that the cost of living is rising, but the capital side feels that it cannot afford it, and the business of shops is in a slump. To seek prosperity, we must first seek stability. (3) Strive for a peace of honor through determination. The peace I am talking about is a peace of victory. Only by seeking victory can peace be hoped for. Without a firm belief, we can never win, and there will definitely be no peace.</p>
<p>Chen Daqing</p>
<p>Chen Daqing said in his speech: Just now, the mayor and speaker both proposed to seek stability through self-defense. I believe that self-defense must be organized, and the power of the collective must be exerted to achieve the goal. I am a new friend of Shanghai, and what I can contribute is only this.</p>
<p>Ni Bi</p>
<p>Ni Bi said in his speech: The CCP's rebellion, although said to be due to the international background, is taking advantage of the weakness. We cannot deny the existence of various unreasonable phenomena such as corruption, absurdity, and shamelessness in the current government. Shanghai is the source of sin, especially the central financial institutions stationed in Shanghai. The Yangshi Company case, which was noisy for a while, has no follow-up, which has caused a lot of misunderstandings. Just based on the various war materials published in the newspaper, it can be confirmed that there are indeed many illegal things in it. If they are allowed to get away with it, it will be a disservice to the people and will definitely lose people's hearts. Therefore, I believe that the most solid defense belongs to the psychological one. All illegal enjoyment and theft of ill-gotten wealth should be brought to justice. The joy on Christmas Eve fully demonstrates the disparity between the rich and the poor in Shanghai. The Shanghai Council is the most righteous and hopes to play a leading role.</p>
<p>Cha Liangjian</p>
<p>Cha Liangjian said in his speech: In this big city of Shanghai, it is fundamentally impossible to seek the complete eradication of crimes. Due to economic, political, and social factors, there are currently five to six thousand criminals in prisons. Compared with the entire population of the city, the number is certainly not large, but it is a great burden on the government. Due to the shortage of the national treasury, the central government has repeatedly ordered to find ways to disperse them, but the security authorities are always trying to seek social stability. If a general release of criminals with habitual crimes would undoubtedly be a major threat to security. Therefore, I hope that the Eighth Council will discuss this issue and debate it.</p>
<p>Fang Zhi</p>
<p>Fang Zhi said in his speech: I believe that peace talks are all rumors spread by the communist bandits. If the government compromises, it will be fooled by the communist bandits. The so-called glorious peace is to strive for victory, and compromise is suicide. But we want to enable the soldiers at the front and the troops defending the local area to fight bloody battles, and we must first make them well-fed and warm. Therefore, the work of comforting them must be carried out with all our efforts, and I hope the council can explore the greatest strength.</p>

<p>Finally, Tong Xingbai delivered a reply on behalf of the councilors, saying: At the opening of this Eighth General Assembly, we have been greatly inspired by the valuable insights of the Speaker and the Mayor. We must face reality and find a solution, and we will never escape. I believe that there are two major problems that need to be solved urgently at present: (1) In terms of economy, the gold exchange method should be improved urgently. Whether its policy is reasonable or not has a great impact on people's lives. Most of the gold currently sold by the government is taken from the people of Shanghai, and due to the unreasonableness of the policy, dozens of people in Shanghai have died due to the rush. It can be seen that the economic policy has a significant relationship with people's lives and local security. I hope that a reasonable solution can be discussed in this council, which will be a major gain of this meeting. (2) In terms of military affairs, although military command belongs to the authorities and the people cannot go to the front to fight, if everyone sticks to their posts and works hard indirectly, they can also exert their greatest strength. I hope the Council can play a leading role, and the Eighth Council will definitely have the greatest gains.</p>

<p>Employees Refuse to Accept and Demand Relief</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Stock Exchange suspended operations, there have been repeated requests to reopen, but without success. Wang Zhixin, general manager of the Stock Exchange, announced today a plan for employee dismissal, stating that reopening is uncertain and maintaining the exchange is very difficult. Employees who voluntarily accept dismissal will receive a severance payment of 3,000 to 3,500 yuan for ordinary staff, and 2,000 to 3,000 yuan for laborers. Those who do not wish to be dismissed will have their salaries frozen at the November amount and do not need to come to the office. The November salary for ordinary staff at the exchange is only just over 600 yuan. The exchange's association of colleagues believes that this meager severance pay will not be enough to maintain their future lives, and unanimously refused to accept it. They have sent representatives to General Manager Wang Zhixin and Chairman Du Yuesheng to request relief. Furthermore, stockbrokers and employees of the exchange are also in the process of dissolving and changing professions.</p>

<p>[Our Reporter] Yuan Xingcan, an officer at the Wusong Police Station, discovered on July 26th of this year that Cao Peifu, the owner of the Xie Xingchang Rice Store at the intersection of Wusong's Wai Ma Lu and Zhongxing Road, was smuggling rice out of the country. At that time, Cao entrusted Gu Qixin to intercede with Wang Tiemei, who in turn spoke to Yuan. After the police station approved Cao's bail, he transferred 300 million yuan to Yuan, who personally received it. After being reported, the case was transferred to the District Court for investigation.

<h3 id="e86">Endangering the State; Charges Not Established; University Student, Female Reporter, and Others All Declared Not Guilty <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Wang Shuiquan, Ju Yishi, Ju Tongkui, Yu Shujian, students of Datong University, and Qian Wei (also known as Qian Weizhu), a female reporter of the Free Forum News, were accused of endangering the state. Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court declared them not guilty. The reasons for the verdict are extracted below: "On June 5th of this year, some students in the city participated in a collective parade against the United States supporting Japan. The Municipal Police Department sent the arrested 54 people to this court for interrogation. Wang and the other five, as well as Tao Dazheng and Wang Zuqi, whose whereabouts are unknown, were charged with violating Article 2, Section 1 of the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Crimes of Endangering the State. However, the defendants Ju Yishi and Qian Wei firmly denied participating in the parade. The defendant Ju Tongkui and Yu Shujian stated that they were arrested while preparing to participate. Only the defendant Wang Shuiquan admitted to participating and had a picket certificate. The other evidence against Zhou Yishi is two reactionary publications, but it cannot be actively proven that they were sent by his brother Zhou Gengshi. Although the collective parade against American support for Japan may have been manipulated by the Communist Party, the defendants either claimed to be at the scene for other reasons and did not participate, or admitted to participating because they mistakenly believed its purpose to be pure. The original indictment lacked concrete evidence to prove whether the defendants had any criminal intent. Even if they knowingly participated in the parade, it is not enough to constitute the above crime."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Over 100 Industrial Loans Approved; Over 30 Million Yuan Loaned; Decision to Improve Methods for Purchasing Finished Products <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] To date, the Central Bank has approved over one hundred emergency industrial loan cases, totaling more than 30 million yuan in loans. Furthermore, the Central Bank has formulated several supplements to expedite the application procedures for manufacturers in order to acquire finished products. The fourth meeting of the Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank's Rediscount Association was held at the Central Bank from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 25th. Over ten people including Zhang Ziyue attended, chaired by Lin Jin, to discuss 85 applications for the acquisition of dozens of industries such as machinery, electrical machinery, metal products, automobile materials, hygiene materials, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, leather, papermaking, weaving, and matches. Excluding those rejected and those instructed to apply for loans through banks or financial institutions, 40 cases of finished product acquisition were approved. After the prices are assessed on Monday, the manufacturers will be notified to negotiate with the designated national bank and treasury. In addition, the committee believes that many manufacturers are still unclear about the purpose and procedures of this finished product acquisition. Therefore, although the committee is striving for speed, the coordination in all aspects is still insufficient. In order to improve this, three methods have been decided and will be implemented immediately:</p>
<p>Three Methods</p>
<p>(1) All approved acquisition cases will be handled according to the following procedures: (A) After the acquisition of finished products is approved, the Rediscount Association will notify the manufacturer by phone or in writing to immediately prepare all procedures and send personnel to the meeting when the Evaluation Committee meets. (B) After the Evaluation Committee assesses the price, it will fill out a valuation form in triplicate, one copy will be given to the manufacturer who attended the meeting, and the other two copies will be sent to the Central Bank's Business Bureau and the handling bank for processing. (C) After the manufacturer has agreed to the assessed price, they should expedite the procedures with the bank. If the price changes due to delayed transportation, they may not request a reassessment. If the procedures are not completed within three days of the price assessment, it will be deemed as a voluntary abandonment. (2) Manufacturers who have already been approved for the acquisition of finished products will not be accepted if they apply to acquire other finished products within three months after the previous case was approved. (3) Applications for the acquisition of finished products or mortgage loans from factories that are partially relocated, preparing to relocate, or whose factory负责人 have left Shanghai, affecting production and laying off workers, will not be reviewed, and the handling banks and financial institutions will be requested to conduct thorough investigations in advance.</p>
<p>Various Loan Cases Approved</p>
<p>The 20th meeting of the Rediscount Association was held at the Central Bank at 11:00 AM yesterday, with over ten committee members in attendance, chaired by Liu Gongyun. The meeting discussed multiple loan cases reviewed by the industrial, mining, agricultural, and trade advisory committees last week. Excluding those rejected and those requiring further investigation, ten cases related to transportation and public utilities, five cases of industrial production, and two cases of export trade were approved. In order to promote the export of foreign trade materials and earn foreign exchange, the committee decided that export business loans should be handled through foreign exchange swaps with a term of 30 days, which may be extended by 30 days if necessary. The designated bank will handle the loan, and the Central Bank's Audit Office will conduct strict audits. If anyone is found to be profiting from the loan, the designated bank's license will be immediately revoked.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Controlling Resources is Extremely Abundant, National Bank Decides to Continuously Dump Fake Currency, Implementing Tight Monetary Policy to Crack Down on Speculators <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Since commodity prices in the city started to stir on Friday of last week, the Central Bank, in order to tighten the money supply and crack down on speculators, has dumped a large amount of gauze on the market. This selling policy is still continuing as of yesterday morning. The person in charge of the bank told reporters from the United Press yesterday morning: The recent fluctuations in commodity prices are entirely the result of manipulation by a small number of speculators. The National Bank has decided to fully cooperate with the local authorities' political power to give them a head-on blow, ensuring that speculators have no way to use their skills. He also stated that the resources currently controlled by the National Bank are extremely abundant and sufficient for long-term sales.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the money supply in the market turned loose again. The source of funds became prosperous due to the arrival of floating capital from other places. Although the demand notes were redundant, the turnover was quite easy. The market interbank lending rate hovered around 15 yuan per day, equivalent to 4.5 cents per month, with the highest being 18 yuan, and excessive orders reappeared near noon.</p>

<p>Cash chips were quite popular yesterday, with extremely urgent demand outside the industry. Internal banks and dealers, however, saw a significant reduction in the balance of deposits in the central bank due to a large number of deposit withdrawals in recent days. It is said that after the atmosphere of a standstill in the current situation disappeared, the southward flow of funds from this city became prosperous again, so large banknotes of 50 yuan or more continued to be discounted.</p>
