<h3>國大今選舉副總統　大會預定明日下午閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國民大會定廿三日上午舉行副總統選舉大會，廿二晚主席團開會時，已推定廿三日上午大會主席由戴傳賢担任，並通過副總統選舉票形式，選票係用國產紙，楷書·紅字·精印·一面書中華民國三十七年四月廿三日，副總統選舉票，第一屆國民大會第一次會議團印。另一面爲副總統候選人孫科·于右任·李宗仁·程潛·莫　惠·徐傳霖姓名，主席團會中當推定于學忠·于斌·蘇挺三人監察蓋印，每一選票上並由于·蘇·于三人分別蓋章後密封。廿三日晨再當衆開封，選舉後當時開票，如無人超過半數，先選定前三名，下午四時舉行第二次選舉，已推定張希文主席，如仍無結果，將於廿四日上午舉行第三次選舉，惟大會仍定廿四下午閉幕。廿三日上午選舉情形，仍由中央電台自上午十時半起開始廣播，外賓七十五人亦將親臨觀禮。又副總統選舉開票方式，廿二日晚主席團會議亦曾提出討論，決議改爲唱票方式，每一候選人之票數，均逐票在計票器上表明</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕開幕廿五天之第一屆國民大會第一次會議按照日程，雖已進入結束階段，但中外人士似未因大會閉幕期近，而稍减其密切之注視。蓋大會尙有一選舉副總統之重要工作，將在廿三日舉行。依照中華民國憲法，副總統一職，一般人咸以爲。</p>
<p>有職而無權惟有識之士則深知此表面有職而無碟之副總統，實際上除六年任期內，應對總統盡其輔弼之責任外，在憲法規定之若干情形下，更必須具備隨時可以代行總統職權之條件，故其責任之重大，與其地位之崇高，兩者間實相一致。依據總統。副總統選舉罷免法第三條之規定，總統·副總統必須以得代表總額渦半數之票數，方爲當選，因之如廿三日正午選舉結果揭曉時，六位候選人如無一獲得超過代表總額之半數之票（本屆國大代表總額三零四五人，超過半數至少應爲一五二三票），則依上述選舉罷免法同條第二款之規定，應「就得票比較多數之首三名，重行投票圈選一名，」此爲第二次投票，如仍無得票渦半數者，依法「舉行第三次投票，團選一名，如仍無人當選時，就第三次得票比較多數之首二名圈選一各，以得較多票數者爲當選，票數相同時，重行圈選一名，以得較多票者爲當選。</p>

<h3>大會續通過提案　電海內外同胞共起勘亂　內河及沿海航行權請政府切實維護</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國民大會廿二日繼續討論提案，上午九時三十分舉行第十五次大會，主席團第一組輪値，由李宗黄主席，出席代表一千六百七十人，秘書處報吿第十四次大會紀錄後，即開始討論提案。第七審査委員會審査報吿關於邊疆之提案四十四件，第一審査委員會審査報吿關於憲法之提案一百四十五件，第二審査委員會審査報吿關於國防之提案一百二十四件，均於上午照審査意見順利通過。在上午大開快車通過三百一十三案之過程中，但聞報吿員之報吿聲，主席無異議通過聲，大會平靜無波，各代表均少發言。但爲常設機構提前討論問題，會塲中又起一陣波瀾。臨時動議，提付表決，但經兩次正反表決結果，贊成變更議程歷一刻鐘恢復平靜。休息十分鐘後，繼續討論，盲代表凌鐵庵提出總統。副總統應在國民大會堂中就職，並向全體國大代表宣誓，因已超出所討論提案之範圍，主席未付討論，仍繼續宣讀提案審査結果，均無異議通過。提案中有「以國民大會名義通電全國，號召全國人民共起戡亂」案，「以本大會名義通電全國及海內外同胞，一致擁護動員戡亂國策，並責成民選政府督飭全國文武官兵整肅紀綱，激勵士氣，限期剿平匪亂，收復失地，以固國本，而慰民望」案，均經通過，其通電交由秘書處負責車擬，再提出大會通過，至十二時十分散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國大廿二日下午四時續開大會，由胡靖安主席，出席代表僅一三五〇人，不足法定人數，先開談話會，至四時廿五分出席者達一五四〇人，乃改開大會，當將第三·第四兩審委會之外交·經濟提案審査報吿逐條宣讀通過，僅伍天生等提即以原幣償選華僑在海外購置之節約建國儲蓄券案，審査意見爲送政府參酌辦理，經決定改爲送請政府切實辦理，餘均無異議通過，至五時半共通過二七六案，旋討論第一審委會關於常設機構之審査報吿，未獲結果，至六時散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕朱克勤等所提政府不得藉任何理由開放內河航行權，以維航權，而固國本案，已於廿二日大會中討論通過，決議：送請政府切實注意，該案辦法內特强調請政府切實維護航權，不得藉任何理由將內河及沿海航行權擅自開放，以維航權，無論任何國家如有涉及開放及沿海航行權之要求，應予拒絕，如有侵佔我內河及沿海航行權者，應即根據國際公法，强硬交涉。任何國家之船舶，不得擅自駛入我領海範圍，否則應由海軍部及沿海各要塞視作敵輪，用武力制。</p>
<h3>常設機構未解決　數十國代起紛擾　人會主席胡靖安險遭歐擊</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕國大討論提案，兩日來八百餘案，大都以大江之勢通過，詎於二日下午六時主席台上因一小部代表之激動，幾致大打出手。廿二日討論常設機構案未獲結論，時間已屆，主席胡靖安倉促宣布散會，數十代表要求「無異議通過」，未被採　，乃攘臂高呼，蜂擁而登主席台，提出質詢，紛擾於以開始，然斯時胡主席已離席至台後，正擬走入主席團休息室休息，竟被三代表自台後左角小門曳出，各代表即羣起責難，有謂主席違法，不當散會，有指胡鼻怒喊：「你不配作主席」，有以懇聲相駡，更有呯呯擊案，連聲；「揍你」，胡本擬聲辯，旣見形勢不佳，乃掙出重圍，向台後右角小門逃避。十數代表由雲南順寗代表曾作大理縣長之張廷勛，及本爲退讓簽署代表經奔走後始獲出席之工會李鴻儒等，領先咆哮追逐，滿台鬧成一團。若干新聞記者詢張姓名，張拒不作答，反將其書有姓名號碼之佩條密藏袋中，並繼續向胡追擊，各記者堅欲索看佩條，於爭持間將其佩條扯下，始知乃張廷勛，時胡巳乘間隱去，張乃轉移目標，對各記者横眉豎目，幾欲動武。激起在場記者公憤，同聲斥爲大會恥辱，並即當衆宣佈其姓名號碼，張知理屈，乃於索還佩條後狼狽下台，合上糾紛漸吿平息，而台下代表則羣集，小組議論不一，有謂張廷勛貽羞大會，有謂胡靖安當付懲戒，亦有謂大會職員打代表者，然終以無發洩對象，復嫌記者礙着，無可奈何，劉宜廷乃轉念稱：「明日如不解決常設機構問題，決不敎他選舉」，至下午六時半，衆始散去，一塲擾攘，乃吿終止。</p>

<h3>國大紀程　壓軸好戲的上演</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕照旣定議程，第一屆國民大會第一次會議的壓軸好戲，就是廿三日的選舉副總統大會。從大會揭幕之前，李宗仁在北平首先宣布公開競選副總統始，程潛，孫科，于右任，莫德惠相繼而起，緊接着民社黨推出了徐傅霖，於是候選人公告牌上齊頭列出了六個人的名字。競選的活動，隨着開會而從外地集中首都，更從會外搶先的打入塲裏，至於方式的運用更是各有千秋，宣傅的攻勢，情感的拉攏，理性的說服，處處是力的角逐與對比。在這選舉的前夕，更是無所不用其極，會塲裏傳單亂飛大街上標語滿墻，報紙上廣吿盈版，各色布招和　　競邀注意，廣播的音響隨時把人們的耳朶提起。幾位競選人虛虛實實，大致都能表現一個原則，便是「勢均力敵」。</p>
<p>徐傅霖　照候選人公告的逆順序，先說連署人最少的徐傳霖。他的宣布競選是民社黨的決策，以進爲退，免得民社黨一百四十張票子，東拉西扯，被別人撕的粉碎，結果還得把人開罪。徐老先生說，他沒有政見發表，副總統應以總統的政見爲政見；同時他也沒有請過客。反之，當他率領着民社黨員赴招待宴時他一再希望別人當選，並且在二十一日的晚宴上，他當面說在必要時對程潛作最大支持。</p>
<p>莫德惠　莫德惠是以社會賢達的身分參加競選的，參政會同仁，東北華北的鄕朋是他的基本票。他的競選和他平日爲人作事一樣的謙冲和平，他一樣的請客，但請的不兇；他一樣的有兩幅油畫像，但不太大，色彩也不太刺目：他一樣的笑着和人拉手，但却沒有使人感到急切的神情；最　的是他的競選香烟也是冲淡宜人。柳老的競選，完全是東方式的那麼老成持重，自有兵　。</p>
<p>程潛　程潛的競選委員會發言人曾宣稱：「最後勝利必歸於最不雄辯然最誠實的人。」程頌雲的誠懇木訥，使大會一般的意見都爲之感動，他以無派系，超然大公來號召。何成濬，唐式邀，趙恒惕，范予遂，燕化棠都在爲他活動，他除了向代表們贈送照片外，選用他的「養復園詩集」以文會友，來融洽感情拉攏關係。據說，他在華中很具實力，軍人代表他也可以爭取大半，但是唯一與頌老競選態度不調和的，是自動助選的龔德柏的救國日報，對準了聲聘煊赫的孫科大　其砲。</p>
<p>李宗仁　宣稱公開競選最早的是李宗仁。這位將軍率領了智囊團，在會外多方活動，夫人郭德潔代表則以全力在會塲裏拉票。從運用上來說，李宗仁是最具天才的，他在北平第一次發表的演說就兼顧到各方面，不少蒙古代表們至今還珍重他有關邊胞福利的諾言，他們說他是不輕諾多言的。他運用各方面的分量來加重他的聲望，各國駐華使節的讚譽，敎授學者的推崇，還有平京香港各地報紙與中國民意測驗學會所反映的民意所歸，都以無數明指暗示的傳單來散遍大會。西南，華北都有他的基本實力，苗夷同胞也對他的過去政績與實踐精神信賴很深，壓倒勢的宣傳是用來爭取更多的票的。</p>
<p>于右任　于右老是以「窮」來呼籲的，同時他過去的歷史使他在競選時自然的根深基厚，所以他在最初是謹愼考慮，隨後便堂堂而出。但在衆人影響下，老人除了贈詩詞送墨寳以外，便不得不開始了酬酢，在酬酢裏他又發現了幾十年來種下的善因，現在都成了有力的支助。新疆西藏的邊胞都大部份擁戴他，陜西，上海和職團方面都有他的基本票。老人標榜風度，大會堂門首的巨幅油畫像，是上海知名的靑年畫家宋徵股一日間神來傑構。老人說：「我看了自己的畫像，使我更愛自己，我的名字和我的美髯都是唯一合副總統標準的。」他還說：「這許多參加競選的人士，不但不是我的政敵，而是我的『競友』，如果說我要爭的話，只是一部憲法的完整實現而巳。」</p>
<p>孫科　最後，讓我們來看候選人簽署題名第一的孫科。據他的助選團裏的要員說：「競選的活動裏面，感情要佔很重要的成份，但如果已有自然深厚的感情存在，就不需要活動，否則也是白費力氣。孫副主席所作的是喚醒理智，他要用他本身的政治與學術條件來在這全然不該感情用事的塲合爭勝」。這就是孫科的路綫。從他一切的宣傳品裏，和每天中午分批招待代表們的宴會上的演說裏，很明白地表現出來。和其餘五位代表們比起來，沒有人不承認孫科聲勢浩大。除了廣東海外的基本票子外，從最初起，他的策略便是以他的自信來爭取各地區各單位代表們的信任。他的紅紅綠綠的標語上，說他是「民主的先進，進步的象徵，國際問題權威，制憲的領導者」。對於這種宣傳，客觀的說，代表們沒有人認爲是過分吹擂，相反的，在每次宴會後，他都有收穫。自然，這種煊赫的聲勢，要遭政敵所嫉。救國日報放砲攻擊他，幾次攻勢，使得他聲明放棄立委當選，因爲魚與熊掌兼得的企岡的娥疑，也被政敵們引用施以猛烈的抨擊。有人說，于·李·程·巳聯合起來；更有謠言說，孫科要作國民黨副總裁，在選舉投票的前夕，孫科迭受奇襲，但他所作的仍然是喚醒理性和表示競選的堅決。</p>
<p>誰勝利　六位候選人在今日的局勢，大致是如此，但每個人都仍在費盡心機與氣力，來利用每一分鐘，爭取勝利。孫科夫人陳淑英代表，顯然消瘦了不少，每日裏還要出席會議，聽聽情報，代孫科闢謠。李宗仁夫人郭德潔代表，前天閃了腰，連日還在會塲裏調兵遣將，面授機宜；她眞是運籌帷幄，但永遠說「我們沒有辦法」！于石老熬夜趕墨寳，程頌雲登報贈詩集，莫柳老仍是不聲不響的穩紥穩打，徐傅霖還是充耳不聞的逍遙自在。</p>
<p>但是事到如今，雖然會場里傳單五顏六色滿地滿天亂舞紛飛，靠得住的票子還是靠得住，靠不住的還得看那一舉手一動筆時的一轉念。一般人的看法，第一次選舉決不會有結果，問題是那三位候選人進人　賽？是誰和誰鼎足三分？但無論如何，天下大勢巳定，開始準備活動第二次投票的，不過是二三人。在美國可垂手而獲的副總統，我們却得三番四次的拼。（四月廿二日於南京）</p>

<h3>專論　科學在中國與蘇</h3>
<p>— 胡先驌</p>
<p>——出席中央研究院評議會歸來有感</p>
<p>三月二十五日至二十七日國立中央硏究院第二屆評議會在南京舉行第五次大會，此次大會最主要之任務爲選舉院士，先是在去年十月第四次大會推定院士候選人，由各方提出之四百餘人中推定一百五十人，皆數理生物人文學科中有重大貢獻之績學大儒，推定之後由中央研究院正式公吿，公吿四個月後，再由此次大會各評議員正式以無記名投票法選出共八十一人，經此嚴格鄭重之提名推出選舉之後，當選之院士誠不愧爲今日我國舉術界之領袖，即與世界各國相比，亦無多愧色，故此次選舉，乃中國學術界一空前盛舉。</p>
<p>作者得參與此次盛會，固極感興奮，然盱衡今日之國事，則又愴然欲涕，我國素無科學，嘗憶兒時就傅之日所習者尙爲舉業，歷戊戌政變庚子拳亂之後，至乙巳年淸廷始廢科舉興學校，默西之科學，始得在學校中傳習，然學校初創，課程與設備，至爲簡陋，師資尤爲缺乏，嘗憶宣統元年負笈至京師大學預科就學時，校中以重幣聘請外國敎員敎授今日高級中學所授之課程，學生視之有如天神，期年而考選學生赴美留學，至民國元年作者亦躬與斯選，自是赴歐美求學者漸多，在美國之留學生，乃有中國科學社之奮起，入會者至爲踴躍，數年之後，留學生歸國者多在南北谷大學執敎，而學校以北京大學與東南大學最爲有聲，淸華學校則騙斷派送學生赴美國留學，在此時期科學硏究已漸萌芽，最早成立之科學硏案機關爲丁文江翁文　兩先生所領導之地質調査所，秉志先生與作者則在南京草創中國科學社生物硏究所，各大學之理科各系之敎授亦競領導學生從事硏究，不數年而我國之科學硏究基礎以立，十六年北伐吿成，國民政府創立中央硏究院，，設立各硏究所，國家有此學術機關以領導全國，學術硏究，乃日進不已，不及十年，我國科學家在數學，物理學，化學，地質學，氣象學，生物學，生理學，醫學，農學，莫不有量大之貢獻，差足與歐美各科學先進國家媲美，即我國固有之文字學，語言學，中學，與考古學等，經歐西科學方法薰陶後，亦有劃時代之貢獻，從前所仰視若不可及之外國科學家，已成爲自己之僚友，在短短卅年中，世界上乃有中國之科學與中國之科學家，科學史上乃可載明某項重要之發明，乃中國某某科學家之貢獻，中國乃得由一十八世紀之古老落後之國家，而厠身於二十世紀先進國家之林，回思昔日　路藍縷之艱難，有不竟喜極而涕者矣。</p>
<p>中央硏究院成立已屆二十周年，於是始有院士之選舉，在鄭重籌備之下，使此不滿百數之著名學者博得一舉國承認之終身殊榮，似亦爲政府重視科學之表現，然當此烽火漫天，兵連禍結之際，政府究知重視科學鐫否，尙屬疑問，尤以在此次大會開幕典禮時，政府大員致辭竟不了解此次所選之院士在世界學術界之地位，發言幼稚，令人齒冷，柄國政者對於科學之缺乏認識，與夫平日漠視國內科學進步之情况，於此亦昭然若揭矣。反而觀科學在蘇聯之狀况？蘇聯之通儒院（約等於我國之中央硏究院）爲彼得大帝創立於西歷一七二五年，取法於英國之皇家學會，在一九二五年蘇聯之共產黨攫得政權後更名爲蘇聯科學院，自此以後，政府以全力支特之，遠非他國所能比擬，兼具英國之皇家學會與科學與工業硏究院之功能，硏究之範圍除科學外尙包括語言文學哲學歷史經濟與法律，其「院士」有一百三十九人，通訊院士有一百九十八人，皆學術上之權威，其被選尚較英國皇家學會會員為難，尤有一點與英國皇家學會有別者，即蘇聯科學院院土一經被選，即除其正薪外，每月可另得薪金三千盧布，通訊院士每月可另得一千五百盧布，除此以外，尙可享有優裕之衣料食物配給，並可在特種商店購買一般商店中所無之用品，在普通商店購物亦可享特別之折扣，彼等有汽車，每人在城市中有舒適之房屋，在鄕間有圍以果園之別墅，在莫斯科附近有一宏麗科學院休養院，俾其院士及其家人在暑假休息一月至六星期，在黑海海濱另有一個同樣宏麗之休息院，科學院院士徐其本身爲榮譽職外尙有管理各科學硏究所之權，並爲政府學顧問，科學院管理五十七硏究所，十六研究室，十五博物院，三十一委員會，七十三圖書館，三十五研究站與七學會，在一九四五年科學院中從事科學工作之人員共有四千二百十三人，硏究生六百人，技術員，硏究室助理員，圖書館員，秘書秘書會計員尙不在內，科學院之圖書館藏書一千餘萬岫，在莫斯科有一科學院書店與一科學院印刷所，科學院一九四五至一九四六年之經費為二億盧布。</p>
<p>在一九四五年六月十五日蘇聯科學院慶祝其二百二十週年紀念，自四月起即有此傳說，此後即逐漸籌備，其規權之大劃所罕有，當日蒞會者有代表，一千餘人，包括院士一百四十五人，通信院士二百〇一人，外國科學家一百二十二人，共餘者皆不蘇聯科學家，開幕典禮異常隆重，政府之招待豐盛無比，演說業會旅行參觀亘二星期，紀念會後全國報紙尚　積敘說科學院至數月之久，蘇聯之重視科學，於此可見，說者爲蘇聯視科學如宗敎殆非虛語，此蘇聯所以科學發達，國力强大，短短二十年間一躍而為世最大二強國之一也。</p>
<p>我國之政府固亦未當不知科學之重要，蔣主席在抗戰期間屬次大聲疾呼「無科學即無國防，無國防即無國家」，每年在國慶日必有科學運動週，到處講演宣傳科學之重要，然我國之重視科學至此而止，至於實際之情形，則科學乃視為與國家民族休戚無關之奢侈品，中央研究院與各大學之研究所經費均異常竭　，使我國之著名之科學家有英雄無用武之嘆，科學家之待遇甚至不能及一政府營業機關之工友！以致我國青年有為之科學家寗在國外研究不肯歸國，楚材晉用，言之扼腕，而堂堂之行政院秘書長在中央研究院開幕典禮致辭中竟謂此次選舉院士以後，希望中國之科學研究可以追從外國之碩士博士　此種國家乃欲談「無科學即無國防，無國防即無國家」，寗非蘇木求魚乎？嗚　！</p>
<h3>陜境匪竄渡涇河，川陜鄂聯防佈署竣事</h3>
<p>〔本報西安廿二日電〕據軍息：匪酋彭德懷，刻在枸邑東北之楊家坡，指揮涇河流域戰事。渡河之主力，爲第一縱隊張宗遜，第二縱隊王震，及第四縱隊王世泰等之一部，共僅數千人。武功西北之召公鎭，天渡鎭等地，發生接觸，乾縣無大變化。某方面觀察，認匪僅竄擾性質，國軍大軍雲集，二日內即可將該方面匪擊退。又匪圍攻洛川逾月，始終不得逞，其第三縱隊主力已向東北潰逃，守軍正追擊中。</p>

<h3>軍事觀察家指出　撤防延安　基於戰略</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京二十二日電〕此間消息靈通軍事觀察家相信：國軍之自延安撤防，乃係不久將在各綫變動聯合攻勢之先聲。此舉顯已擊破共產黨方面之原來計劃，共黨原擬以攻下延安作爲其宣傳之藉口，今政府基於戰略計劃而主動放棄延安，一自與共軍攻下該城不同。觀察家一並信延安之放棄，與政府最近所一採放棄孤立據點之戰略計劃有關一。軍界人士並指出下列數點：（一）延安之放棄表示國軍之春季攻勢即將發動，（二）政府苟無再度收復延安之把握，當不致遽予放棄。（三）政府之放棄延安。顯然並非在壓力下所採之行動。觀察家並指出一年零一個月前國軍進佔延安，重要在於該地之爲共黨政治中心，並不在該地之爲戰略要點，政府如有必要，仍將堅守孤立要點，此可由長春·瀋陽之迄在國軍掌握中證之。根據以上種種理由，觀察家相信延安之主動放棄　，爲已定戰略計劃之一部份。</p>

<h3>潛伏楊樹浦發電廠共匪　「六個黨」組織破獲　陰謀造成黑暗上海敗露　警部捕獲十一人供出集會行動經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕淞滬警備司令部昨發表：上月底，上海電力公司楊樹浦發電廠內發電機中，有人放入鐵屑，幾致全市電力停頓，幸於四月一日晚發覺，經公司極力搶修，始告無事。事發後，治安當局極爲注意，經多方調査，卒告破案，確係共匪企圖破壞本市主要發電機器，製造恐怖，使數十萬工人失業，藉以造成混亂局面之陰謀。至今業已逮捕吳世紳，王孝和（鄭縣人），吳國楨（廣城人），談阿四，宋長庚（淮安人），湯蘭生（上海人），馮仁忠，黃洪動，石金根（上海人），戴壽根（宜興人），顧榮生等十一人。茲將該案主犯王孝和與吳國楨二人供詞節錄如下：</p>
<p>工會理事王孝和供詞</p>
<p>王孝和，廿五歲，浙江鄞縣人，上海電力公司三班頭工人，現任工會理事。</p>
<p>問：楊樹浦發電廠用鐵屑破壞機器，是否是你主持的？</p>
<p>答：是根據二次集會，有一個姓沈的叫我做的。</p>
<p>問：你將二次集會經過述一遍</p>
<p>答：第一次在虹鎭徐周良家，一大約在三月廿六日左右，參加者有十餘人，對於此次上海逮捕工人，皆不滿意，一致要求以行動表示，結果並無任何議決。第二次在吳世紳家中，參加者計有沈鴻聲，吳世紳，黄洪勳，王孝和，馮仁忠等五人，我曾談及如破壞機器，可用炸彈，當時黄洪勳表示反對，認爲不能取得社會同情，應當發動羣衆力量爭取。散會後，沈鴻聲對我講，以後如要行動，我另外派人同你接頭並規定接頭暗號「AA」。兩日後，由沈鴻聲派人至我家，呌我設法放置鐵屑在直流電地軸中，如機器爆炸，工人即均離工廠，向政府請願。以後我即找棚格部工人姜杏根，叫他做這個事。因他膽小，推辭不做。我又找油間工人吳國楨，張世寳（銅匠）做，他們就答應了。在三月卅日夜裏，即田張世寳找到鐵屑，由吳國楨放人地軸內，到四月一日晚上十時訐被發覺，因爲放的是粗砂（即鐵屑）故未爆炸。</p>
<p>問：楊樹浦發電廠中，共匪有一個核心組織，呌做「六個黨」是那幾個人？</p>
<p>答：有吳世紳，黄洪勳，馮仁忠，談阿四，沈鴻聲及我共六人。每週集餐一次，討論廠中情形，由沈鴻聲負責的。</p>
<p>加油小工吳國楨供詞</p>
<p>吳國楨，江蘇鹽城籍，二十五歲，上海電力公司加油小工。</p>
<p>問：三月三十日，有人將細砂放入直流電油蓋下。王孝和說：是張世寶給你的細砂，由你放入</p>
<p>答：張世寳跟我說：要我把鐵屑放進去，我起先不願做這事，後來王孝和對我說：你是個很好的孩子，過去你在老工會很不錯，現在你對這次行動一定要做到，因爲現在政府在逮捕我們很多工人，我們要把點顏色給政府看。我在他這些誘惑言語之下，意志搖動，乃接受了他的驅使，仍由張世寳交給我一袋鐵屑，要我放入四部機器內，但是那時我受着良心上的責備，只放入了兩部，就對他們說，通通放好了，實在我只放了兩部，放的時候，由張世寳把風，有人把手一招爲記，即刻放下。</p>
<p>問：王孝和什麽時候呌你加入共產黨的？</p>
<p>答：歐陽祖潤逃走的時候。</p>
<p>問：在什麽地方加入的？</p>
<p>答：在匯山公園，由王孝和聯絡加入的。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕滬西好萊糖果廠經理楊景周受合灣六一糖菓廠之聘，赴台灣數日，歸途在民生公司民衆輪中神秘失踪，詳情業誌二十一日本報。此離奇變故發生後，家屬惶惑異常，其岳父嚴少堂乃於十六日乘華聯輪趕往台灣探詢，於昨日原輪返滬。據談在台兩日，不得要領而返。該六一糖菓廠係興台公司管理，廠址甚爲荒僻，規模雖不小，但設備甚爲窳陋。廠中人稱：楊景周於四月五日抵台，當晚即往廠中，翌日視察廠中設備，商議製糖計劃。七日曾試製絲光糖。八日晨出外訪友至晚始歸，至深夜十時許謂發寒熱，經廠中職員伴往古亭醫院診治。九日又外出，至夜未歸。十日晨重返早餐後，稱將返滬，後即離廠未歸，遺下灰色大衣一件，咖啡色帆布手提包一隻云。楊景周上船之後，夜半失蹤，究係失足落海，抑係被人謀害，成為伶疑案。但彼在船上遺留之皮包中，有記事册內寫「我入虎穴」，「天父天父，有救無救，生死大數」。又據同艙客談，楊上船時曾被數人包圖，將其船票奪去，則顯然楊事先巳知身在險境，但楊本人素來沉默寡實，孜孜硏究，並無仇家，台灣且係初次前住，身邊毫無　　　有何人必欲得其性命而甘心？其家屬悲　之餘，頗感束手無策，深　滬台兩地之治安當局能澈底調査以</p>

<h3>私人貿易代表　二批定期赴日</h3>
<p>一般觀察開展不易</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第二批赴日私人貿易代表，將於本月廿七及下月八日分批赴日。據悉盟總方面，對我國目前管理輸出入之辦法相當隔膜，希望我國政府能提供正式資料，作爲參考。前次赴日商人代表曾紀殷赴京時，亦曾向有關部會提出此項請求，將來可能由我國提出對日准許進出口商品之淸單，以釋盟總之疑。據有資格人士之觀察，現階段之私人對日貿易，爲有限制之易貨性質，開展至屬不昀。例如日本之紡織機，可大量製造輸入我國，但盟總之交換條件，為我國必須以大批煤鐵供給，使其能繼續生產，一如英國以大量印棉輸日，易取日本織造之布疋者然。我國目前欲做到此點，顯有困難。</p>

<h3>吸收游資打擊投機囤積　國庫劵即將發行　國行經濟研究處長發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三十七年短期庫券發行在即，國行經濟硏究處長冀朝鼎對庫券發行之意義，發表其個人觀察如下：（一）短期庫券在原則上，乃依市塲利率吸收游資，以打擊投機囤積。因囤積須負担利息損失，如物價上漲比率趕不上利率，囤積者將自受其害。故發行庫劵將加重投機者之成本負担，並能轉移游資之趨向。（二）發行短期庫券與高利貸不同，僅爲以貨幣計算之市塲利率，且因其能打壓投機囤積，故尙有平抑利率之效能。同時，目前之游資出入投機者之手，政府縱不吸收，正當之工商業亦不能利用，故謂政府此舉在與工商業爭取資金，誠屬似是而非之論。（三）短期庫券之發行，不致影響銀錢業之存款業務。因今日銀錢業之存款均屬活存性質，並無儲蓄意義，眞正儲蓄者均改用存儲物質之方式。短期庫券之發行，將爲儲蓄者開一途徑，但並不影響銀錢業之存款業務。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕央行總裁張嘉璈於昨晨八時乘機晋京，聞此行與短期庫券之發行有關。又據證券業方面消息，短期國庫券之發行手續，已大致決定，時期將在下週。各經紀人均已準備交易，估計可能以八五折見諸證交塲中。</p>

<p>晨初以遞交。幣制。及票據均有助長買氣之訊，上塲見昂，永紗以一九八〇元登塲，被賣到一九四〇元，二三一號等進意尙濃，乃漲到二〇〇五元高價，二二四號等脫手，代辦費開高爲二一元及二四元，而後見回。盤旋之後，物資略回，大戶龔某暗售，六九號等亦奮售，近午終被帶小退至一八八五元低價，午收爲一八九三元。較前收計火柴大通微升，閘北跌半成，餘均少挫。</p>
<p>後市交易零星，永紗始終在一九〇五元至一九二五元間徘徊，四五號買進，一五四號脫售，高低價俱屬此二家所出入。國行差進，亦無多大影響，收市爲一九二〇元。結果較晨收計永公商務國貨新華均平，火柴大通微挫，餘均小升。塲外各未上市股票，升降俱微。</p>
<p>公債昨上落有限，成交約四百萬。統丙晨開一〇萬八，低價止於一〇萬四五，而後稍穩。結果較前收計統丁尙平，丙跌二千元，戊種降落三千元，甲乙小挫一千元。</p>
<p>外股昨初疲後穩，籌碼有限，易升難低，散戶之供給有限，廣帮錢莊有買。怡紗晨開二七九萬，自二八〇萬退至二七七萬左右，而後稍穩。午後回升至二八二萬，而後見平，結果較前收計業廣怡啤航業均平，餘均稍漲。</p>
<h3>保險業增資限期　財部允考慮展緩</h3>
<p>資本保證金額難變更</p>
<p>關於財部規定保險業資本由一億元增爲一百億元，以半數實收，保證金亦改爲十億元，以現金存入國行，並限於本年六月底前增資竣事。經該業派代表晉京請願，要求財部减低資本增加額，保證金改爲實物繳存，並請展緩限期。聞以上三點要求，財部僅對第三點允予考慮，但延期亦不致過久云。</p>
<h3>客銷依然不振　紗布繼續下游</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，勢　盤局，除十六支各級本街稍見去化，市價略　硬紮，其餘各檔繼續盤小。晨開四二支藍鳳開出即回降至二億三千萬，嗣後雖複製業吸收，一度回至二億三千三百萬，奈以供過於求之下，終吿回落，結果仍以開盤行情收市，續疲四百萬。四二支寳光及水月等，亦再挫三四百萬。四〇支及三二支各級，均再小一百萬至四百萬不等。二十支以下各檔，本街及客銷依然不振，喊價繼續下游一百萬至三百萬不一。</p>
<p>昨棉布市况，布商逢高即拋，各地客帮咸拘觀望，散戶進出雖繁，但波動甚微。紡建公司　次開售額子充裕，籌碼頗寬，晨開十二磅龍頭細布四九二萬元，一度挺至四九六萬元，北帮先行賣出，即現疲憊，終以四九一萬收市，昨日紡建公司供售五福細布，價爲四五三萬元，准購單加價三萬元，最後至十二時半實力派賣出龍頭籌碼，復挫至四八八萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售布，共售布三六六八五疋，被單九〇條，申購單共八四〇張，內除廠商廿四張購布一三七〇疋外，餘悉屬布　所購。</p>
<h3>現棉交易清淡</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因產區價格稍高，同業供售稀少，市上籌碼不多、貨主脫意鬆懈。花管會收購價略予提高，一部份散戶軋於銀根，略有脫手，人心尙屬者高，故交易不旺，趨勢穩中帶堅，價格好起三·五萬，成交三五〇包。沙市做開二四〇〇萬，鄭州二四七〇萬，德字二五七〇萬，鷄脚棉一九八〇萬，老河口二二五〇萬，火機一八○〇萬，以上均爲送公庫價，周浦籽花四七一萬。</p>
<p>又訊：紗管會因各地存棉，最近在空·陸·水·三路並運之下，即將湧至上海，因是於昨日又租得裕盈倉庫兩處，專爲儲存上項來棉之用。</p>
<h3>毛紡織業公會　請免調整羊毛稅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市毛紡織業公會，以羊毛貨物稅，自本年一月份起，逐月調整，五月份調整在即，特函呈貨物稅局，列舉理由兩點，請暫免予調整，以維商艱：（一）毛織品夏令滯銷，市價常低於廠盤達三成之多，各廠爲維持開支，不得不削價求售。（二）原料限額分配不足實際用量五分之一，原料上漲率，又多高於成品。故設再行增稅，勢將再行增價，致銷路更呆，反致影響稅收云。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>東北流通券入關通匯地點，原祇限於平，津兩地，嗣應事實上之需要，特增加靑島，濟南，西安等五處，目前仍可酌量增加。</p>

<p>新医与新藥</p>
<h3>農村之敵　鈎蟲病</h3>
<p>— 王完白</p>
<p>近接蘇州滸騔關蠶種製造塲來函，略謂：敝塲自置桑地，雇有桑工，專司培植，每年黄霉季節，工人赤足入桑地工作，不數日即見足背微腫，奇癢難忍，數日後，轉入內病，有微熱，喉癢，咳嗽，以後逐見面色萎黄，精神憔悴，體力不支，終至不能工作。此病俗稱桑葉黄，蘇錫常一帶農村工人，每年罹此病者，不勝其多，影響工作事小，摧殘生命，實不勝悲憫，鄉鎭間醫藥設備，殊爲簡陋，醫治自難奏效，欲往城市求醫，又力有不逮，形成束手無策，聰其自然之局面。憶曩昔貴醫師曾經播音演講，述及在常州主持敎會醫院時，曾有類似之病甚多，不難治愈，夙仰貴醫師醫學精湛，經騐宏富，對此病必有深切之硏究，故函請對此病之起原及其治療預防諸方面，作較詳細之解答，豈獨敝塲之幸福，凡各地有此同病者，必感德無涯云云。</p>
<p>按本病實即鈎蟲病，確爲農村之敵，沿長江流域及京滬一帶，流行極盛，然其他各地，亦多有發見，因其關係頗大，故於福音電台播講之外，特摘要錄出，刋之報端，以喚起衛生當局及社會熟心人士之注意。</p>
<p>病原　此症之原因，係傳染一種細微之寄生蟲而起，名曰鈎蟲，其成蟲細如絲綫，長僅數分，生長在病者小腸中，爲數甚多，附着腸粘膜，吸食人血，故患者有嚴重之貧血，其蟲卵極小，須顯微鏡放大數百倍，方可窺見，病人之糞，每次所含蟲卵有四五兆之多，此即本病傳染之原。</p>
<p>傳染　鈎蟲之卵，在泥土中發育甚速，孵出幼蟲後，四五天即能傳染於人，其途徑由不潔之食物，直接入口者，爲數尙少，大多數係泥中幼蟲由濺人之腿足等處之皮膚，侵入人體，先自靜脈運至心臟，轉入肺部，再循氣管進食道而下至胃腸，寄生吸血，故受染後，先有皮癢，繼而見喉痛，發熱等狀，終則成爲極度貧血，並由蟲所分泌之毒素，而受其毒害，力竭致命。</p>
<p>症狀　成病以後，所顯之主要症狀，爲貧血，面色黄白，怠惰乏力，然胃口仍佳，故亦稱吃食懶黄病，女性病人漸至月經停止，則去死不遠，兒童患此，體實旣弱，學業自不能勝任，脾氣亦壞，令人惹厭，德智體三者並皆失敗，男女農工患此，能吃而不能工作，多被人嘲駡，肉體精神遭受兩野痛苦。</p>
<p>治療　先行檢査糞便，若騐得鈎虫之卵、即須驅虫，普通蛔虫之藥服之無效，專治本病之藥著名者爲藜藿油，服法，前一晚臨睡時，宜先服瀉鹽一磁調羹，化開水四五調羹服之，次晨禁食，在七。八。九點鐘各服藜藿油膠囊五滴裝者一粒，共計三粒，再隔二小時又服瀉鹽二三調羹化開水小半茶杯服下，則虫皆潟出，以糞溶水在陽光中可略見虫形，午間方得進稀粥，以後照常飲食，能進含鐵補血劑更佳，或多食猪肝，可以補血，最好隔二星期再照服虫藥一次以絕根株。</p>
<p>預訪　流行此病二區域，糞便宜用石灰消毒並應久貯坑中，供糞發釀而滅其卵，農作工人必須着鞋襪，勿使皮膚接觸泥土，工畢進食，必先洗凈雙手，皆當嚴格實行，自可避免傳染，望負責之機關廣爲宣傳是幸。</p>
<h3>怎樣控制白喉</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>天花以外，人類研究免疫工作最大的成功，也許要算是戰勝白喉，換句話說也就是人類能控制惡毒白喉的感染。回憶一下歷史，我們就得歌頌羅弗勒（Loeffler）的首先發現白喉桿菌，以後，樂克斯（Roux）及阮新（Yersin）二位專家再作進一步的研究，證明了白喉的症狀，並不是因細菌散佈全身的關係，而是因細菌選集於一處；並不蔓延全身，但其所產生毒素，則被吸入血液循環。一八九二年貝林（Von．Behring）研究結果，證明馬對於白喉有天然免疫性；爲什麽能有免疫性呢？因爲白喉桿菌種在馬身，馬血中便很快的產生了一種抗毒素（Ahtitoxin），這類抗毒素是存在於馬血淸中；若果，再用馬血淸注射於白喉病人體內，則可以發生一種作用，中和細菌所產出的毒素。因着貝林氏的這類新發明，白喉的死亡率從百分之五十降至百分之十以內。如果，我們對於病人救治得早，或者抗毒素的用量適當，那末，死亡率還可减低到百分之二左右。因此，人類能控制白喉，在免疫史上，貝林氏的功績眞是不可毀滅的。</p>
<p>怎樣能控制住惡毒的白喉呢？第一步，是從使用抗毒素開其端，直到一九二〇年預防血淸發現，即白喉菌毒與抗毒素的混合體開始對於小學生注射，保持體中的免疫力。這一項工作的發現，就和詹納發明牛痘一般的偉大，現在我想介紹的便就錫克（Schiek）氏對白喉免疫的豐功偉業。</p>
<p>一九〇八年時錫克氏將微量的毒素注入皮膚內，其分劑爲殺重二五〇克之豚鼠的白喉毒素之最低致死量M.L．D1／50，用0.1　—0.2立糧食鹽液冲淡之，注射於前膊皮內，若在注射處呈現紅暈，即爲陽性；證明我們身體內含有的抗毒素缺乏，容易感染白喉。若爲陰性反應，則表示我們體內每公撮血液內含有三十分之一單位以上的抗毒素，在普通情形下，可以保護我們不致感染白喉。錫克氏這種試騐的結論，至分別可傳染與不傳染兩大類，對於可傳染的則施行預防注射，隔了若干時日，便有免疫性。一九〇二年以後，預防血淸的製法逐漸改良，使用變性的毒素Toxoid實際上其原理還是一樣，用這種預防方法去减輕病勢，確實收到了「事半功倍」之效。據統計，在紐約一地，由一八九〇年至一八九四年時止，那時白喉抗毒素還未普及應用，每年死於白喉的每十萬人中有一百三十四人；再由一九〇〇年到一九〇四年，白喉抗毒素已經普遍採用，白喉的死亡率便由每十萬人中减至爲五十八人。一九一五年至一九一九年間，大家對於白喉抗毒素均有地位，普遍施用，在這幾年中間，死亡率每十萬人中，祗有二十一人。一九二〇年到一九三四年間死亡率僅存二點二，即每年每百萬人中只有二十二人死於白喉。到一九三五年間，紐約一市死於白喉者，每百萬人中祗有九人。在這一年中，美國十九個城市竟沒有一個人死於白喉。由這件事實的結果，證明了，免疫的原理，那就是，白喉抗毒素，祗能保護我們不染白喉，對於其他的傳染病是毫無關係。後來愛立許博士（Dr．Ehrlich）對於免疫性質曾提出過一種側鏈學說（Side　chain　theory）</p>
<p>免疫性，是因人體細胞中產生免疫體（Immunebodies也許有數種器官，如脾，肝，甲狀腺等，對於這種免疫體的製造是特別有力而活動；但，迄今我們知道人體並沒有專造免疫體的器官，或一組的細胞。愛立許博士不過設想傳染病菌或毒質與人體細胞接觸復細胞受了刺激，則造出某一種化學質來中和這個毒素，或者殺死這類細菌。丁惠康</p>
<h3>七千二百〇三人之X光檢查統計</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>國人諱疾忌醫，已爲社會一般之習慣，而尤以肺病爲甚。綜觀虹稱療養院三十六年，七二〇三人之X光檢査統計，發現患肺癆者，在百分之二十二以上。此種現象，實堪痛惜！尤其令人驚異渚，則爲其中發現有兩側肺癆者，共有五六九人之多，幾佔檢査總數百分之八而弱。此等患者，平時大多均不自知，且症象極微；若不經X光檢査，決不知其兩肺均病。故X光診斷，謂爲吾人生命安全之指南針，實不爲過。此其一。此外心臟與大動脈擴張者，有一九五人。若不施行X光檢査，亦決不能知其自身最重要之臟器，已發生重大之病理變化；猶之黑夜航行，危險實甚。此等人若能及早施治，則當能早復健康。此其二。右肺輒較左肺患病者爲多。此其三。以年齡而論，則二十歲至三十歲之靑年，輒爲肺癆侵製之最大日標；而尤以二十四歲，爲人生患肺最危險之年齡。此其四。以職業而論，則無業者與學生界，每爲肺癆之集中點。此其五。</p>
<p>結論：防癆問題之成功與否，與一般國民健康，實有極大聯係。吾人試一思慮，則幾乎每一家庭每一單位，不論爲一商店銀行或學校之間，必有一人至數人爲肺癆所侵襲。故防癆如救火然，吾人決不能任其自然蔓延；非用有效的方法，全力防過之不可。而尤以公共塲所，如學校與工廠，非實施集團檢査，將不自覺的肺癆，一一檢出，方爲澄本淸源之計。猶憶十年以前，在各大學聯合會，愚曾竭力提倡，凡新生考入大學者，必須施行X光檢査。按之近日社會情狀，實爲必要之舉，去秋交大錄取新生三百餘人，在施行X光檢査後，發現患肺癆者七人；一經早期治療，不僅學業不致中輟，個人健康可復；而其家庭，在無形中减少慘劇發生，社會間减少無形傳染。一舉而數利備焉。至於他日學成，爲國致用，尤其餘事。百年樹人，防癆檢査，爲其初步之根本歟！（統計詳附表）</p>

<h3>「橫通」禮讚</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>横通之稱，見於章寶齋文史通義横通篇：</p>
<p>「老實善於販書，舊家富於藏書，好事勇於刻書，皆博雅名流所與把臂入林者也。……然其人不過琴工碑匠，藝術之得接於文雅者耳；所接名流旣多，習聞淸言名論，而胸無智珠，則道聽塗說，根抵之滿陋亦不難窺。周學士長發以比輩人謂之横通，其言奇而確也。……學者陋於見聞，接横通之議論，已如疾雷之破山，遂使魚目混珠，淸濁無別，而其人亦為然自命，不知其通之出於横也！……」</p>
<p>這說法對是對的，但難免有些刻薄。淸代人都是注重窄而深的研究的，漢書藝文志所說東髮受學，皓首不能窮經，或者不錯。陳碩甫爲了一部手詩傳疏，費盡四十年心血，先草長編，後成專著，我們眞得佩服到五體投地，然而拚了偌多時間，不過給極盡附會之能事的手續找出若千不即不離牽强萬狀的證據，這時間也就花得够可憐了。</p>
<p>自然，我們的時代變了，眼光擴大了，與古人的看法，根本不同，可是當時的馬瑞辰等人著述，實有比陳書高明之處，然則我們亦復不能盲目崇拜功夫堆成的虛僞寳塔，固亦彰彰明甚。不過我所要辨的，還不是簡單的時間問題，乃是說今日的社會環境，簡直不允許我們有這些工夫與可能，即使有這樣扛鼎的巨著，恐怕也很少有人能消化得動！從前多說乾嘉學者是受了文字獄的影響，不能不向牛角尖鑽研，於是在經學方面，有赫赫千百卷的皇淸經解正續編，史學更可汗牛充棟，然我的看法，還得歸宗唯物，主要是那時物力豐盈，生活簡易，特別是江南魚米之壽，人人都在極度安適與平定中討生活，學問原來是生產於安定的，古典硏究，更是如此，好像有錢人家修建房屋，畫棟雕　，曲盡藻飾之能事，若是露宿風餐的人，也只有蓋幾間茅棚，聊避風雨而已，古人所說飢者易爲食，寒者利裋褐，亦即是理。乾嘉時代是何等景象？比之今日的米價物價生計狀况，怎麼能够扯到一起？我讀汪龍莊遺書，所記康熙時代鬧水災，米價不過數百文一斗，已竟大聲疾呼，認爲天下不得太平了！若令他們生於今日，正不知如何！陳碩甫，段懋膺，王懷祖一輩大師，倘於今日爲大學敎授，想亦只有呼籲無門，牛衣對泣，說文解字注與經傳釋詞，想來也永無成書之一日也。</p>
<p>照此說來，今日能够横通也就不差。以書賈而論，彼時還可以接儒雅聲刻，道聽而塗說之，雖胸無智珠，畢竟不是低級趣味，目下怎樣？北平是舊書店集中地，不是也都捆載而入於廢紙肆，論斤出售嗎？即使政府曾撥十億之多，搶救這些「物資」，杯水車薪，收效幾何？而且親眼看見多數售舊畫的店家都改爲專賣新書了，所謂新書，實只限於馮××的言情說部，××樓主的劍俠奇談之類，欲求横通，豈可得哉！書賈如楚，再看黌舍的坐擁畢比者流，究有多少眞能以學問領導羣倫，像五四運動時的北大，像戊戌政變時的萬木草堂時務學堂呢？眞有本領的，或去作尊官，或去辦實業，或者索興到太平洋彼岸的哥侖比亞，加州，哈佛等大學去賺美金了，賸下一些啼飢號寒人們，在此掙扎，生活重壓之下，欲求其通之横，已是極難，况專精乎？</p>
<p>這裏還有一層意思，則是純粹理論的了，學問之這，　　而後精深，所謂金字塔式的成就也。換言乏，也就是任何專門　　，都必須建設在常識上。常識不是專門，而是普通的作人必知之理論，這個也未嘗不可以呌做横通，或者名之爲「古今中外派」。我覺得今日爲學，再像漢儒那樣守。「家法」「師法」，定是愚人妄人。一點科學方法，科學知識是每個人所必具，否則就會成爲盲普，（王充論衡，「知今而不知古謂之陸沉，知古而不知今，謂之盲瞽。」）縱使你是專門的漢宋經師，又有什麼功用？爲學問而學問的時代已竟過去了，雖不見得學皆致昂，但目前之用，我們豈能視若無覩？所以横通本身雖要不得，作爲專門學術的底子，則是唯恐失之。頗有人主張學文史的不必知道物理化學，大約是不甚明白常識之重要，倘貫通此意，則中國學術界可以轉入一嶄新時代矣。</p>
<h3>論電影</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>好久不看電影了，竟常有好管閑事的朋友垂詢：「怎麽不看電影了？」言下且有不勝驚奇之狀，好像見我絕食似的。</p>
<p>我之久矣乎不看電影，實際上只因爲—無錢或不懂英文。但我不肯直言談相，却去四面找尋堂皇冠冕的理由，「有志者事竟成」，終於給我找到了說來頗足以寫成一篇論文的理由—而且共有兩個。</p>
<p>第一，看過幾年或幾十百次電影的人而看電影，對不起得很，其愚不及也。電影據說是美國的好，而我的抽屜中却有一條十念年前的華盛頓郵報剪報，是關於好萊塢的，其言曰：「我們總還得讚美好萊塢有若干高明之處。一個故事不管用了多少次數，一張片子倒總有一個不同的名字的。」</p>
<p>第二，我的十歲以上的孩子好看電影甚於愛讀書，一星期沒有電影看就鬱鬱不樂，星期日請他看一次星期二還以未能續看爲不快。我想這孩子多沒出息，隱憂在抱而去有學校的地方察訪察訪，呣，原來一般十四五歲挾書包的少年朋友，不少在談論電影與電影明星，如「某某，那隻某某電影看過沒有？眞『嶄』呢！」「怎麼不看，那主角眞『靈』！」之類。後來在電車上，因爲注意的原故，也就常聽見少年男女的電影談。</p>
<p>於是我就注意到報上的電影廣吿，略加分類，約獲其三：女俠金絲虎，魔俠喋血記，小白龍，金剛，間諜網，大破恐怖彈，兇手，凶宅，寳劍神鞭，閃電大盜，神鞭大俠之類爲一類，屬於神怪武俠；走私美人，釵光劍影，鴛盟，美人計，美人魚之類爲一類，屬於香豔肉感風流愛情；第三類是文藝倫理，惜乎鳳毛麟角，記不下幾個名字來，只好從略。</p>
<p>我不知道一般少年男女最愛看那一類，我也不知道少年男女多看了這種電影的結果是怎樣，我只自己不看，並且多備連環圖畫給孩子們看，以代電影，一則省錢，二則權衡利害，愚意以爲前者或者尙勝於後者一籌。</p>
<h3>男女之間</h3>
<p>— 霜</p>
<p>年長一點的女人，常她們不能再作壞榜樣的時候，便勸年靑一點的女人爲善。—C·E·M·裘特</p>
<p>節儉的丈夫配上了浪費的妻子，家裏難免要吵吵鬧鬧，但跟吵鬧不休的另一家比較，那又算得什麽？原來另一家是一個浪費的丈夫配上了一個節儉的妻子。—E·G·文斯</p>
<p>上等女人—一個能使任何男人見了她容易變成一個上等男人的女人。—佚名</p>
<h3>公醫制</h3>
<p>— 燕父</p>
<p>因了妻的病危，乃彌深地感到公醫制的重要；一個不能保障每一個人的高水準生活的社會還不能算作如何不合理，不能保障每一個人充分就業的社會也還不能充分證明其如何的落後；乃至不能使多數人充分就醫才是最慘的事。科學到今天還沒有進步到「無疾不可醫」的全能地步，但畢竟已在儘量解除人類病理上的危厄與痛苦，若是這一點的可能都因爲人爲的原因，把病人隔難在可能克服的困難以外，拒絕在可能解決條件以外，則應該是最殘酷的實例了。難怪進步的醫學者在大聲疾呼建立公醫制。任何標榜「慈善」性質服務性質的醫藥機構都在伸手向有錢或無錢的病人要錢，錢，錢，錢，有錢的人有福了—沒有錢的人想進醫院，「比駱駝穿針眼還難」，這是現實，這是殘酷的現個！</p>
<p>聽說英國已在實行公　制了，英國的國策是與蘇聯的流血革命政策絕對不相容的，可見公醫制非必源於什麽共產邪說。我們響往着眞的三民主義實現之日，起碼病人不被閉担在孔方型的醫院之門外了——然而，三民主義又何日實現呢？思之愁絕！</p>
<h3>霍夫曼其人</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>美國援外法案執行人保爾霍夫曼，是以賣汽車起家的。他在芝加哥大學念了一年　，就輟學去兜銷汽車，賣貨是他的拿手。他在洛杉磯汽車市塲上，大顯身手。第一次大戰時當了兩年砲兵，又回到洛杉磯，開了一爿史蒂貝克汽車經銷處。</p>
<p>一九二五年，他榮任史蒂貝克副總裁，負責營業。一九三三年，該公司幾瀕破產，霍氏襄助改組。一九三五年，出任總裁，直到現在。</p>
<p>霍夫曼不抽烟，絕對戒飲。是一個實幹的人。他認爲開明的資本主義，是世界上生產力最强大的經濟制度。</p>
<h3>書業神探</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在一九三一年的一個寒冷的早晨，有一個行人駐足在紐約東端的一家舊貨店的門前，他隨意的翻取一堆水漬的舊書，從其中挑出了一本。</p>
<p>「多少錢？」他問店主說。</p>
<p>「五分錢一本。」</p>
<p>一筆交易成功了。那位行人是第五街的狡猾的書商李却華姆薩。他用五分錢所買下來的書是孤本中的最罕見者之一—大詩人愛倫坡的第一段也是最後一段的「塔美連詩集」。華姆薩以兩萬五千元的善價將這本詩集脫手，那個舊貨商後來知道了這件事，竟然氣得自殺。</p>
<p>華姆薩是搜羅孤本和珍本書籍的專家，他從事這項工作已近二十年，有美國第一號書業偵探之稱。這位藍眼珠的「書蛀虫」，吃書，睡書，做夢也忘不了書。他的驚人的偵探書的能力，使他的生意極爲興旺，收藏家，博物院，圖書館，學校，工業機關，廣吿代理商，甚至動物院，都源源的委託他購書。</p>
<p>事主的委託常使華姆薩發現有趣的歷史翻案。例如，大多數的美國人都深信他們的國父華盛頓是一個溫文有禮的大人物。但是，有一部份美國的歷史家都相信他們的第一任大總統是　一個乖戾的，粗暴的，並且無禮的人物。一位美國古代史專家委託華姆薩盡量的搜羅由華盛頓親自寫的文件，他在各地的書市塲中扒掘了幾個月之後，終於找到了一本華盛頓所寫的東西，書名是：「交友與交談的禮貌與合禮的舉止的準繩」，足以證實華盛頓是一個講究禮節的彬彬君子。</p>
<p>華姆薩原是一個經營遠東珠寳的進口商，他爲了想找尋一個能增加他對珠寳的智識的書商，未能成功，便親自銷進　堆裏去，結果發現了許多一般量商所不知道的事體，於是便決心改行，而成爲今天的「書業福爾摩斯」。</p>
<h3>關於婚姻教育</h3>
<p>— 石文</p>
<p>最近滬江大學計劃設置有關婚姻的科目，頗博各界好評，「自由談」上也屢見討論的文章。但是，社會上似乎還有一部份人士是抱着保留態度的，甚至滬江的敎授也不例外。</p>
<p>事實上，美國北卡羅林那大學在二十年前（一九二七），就已經設置關於婚姻在心理的和生理的各方面問題的課程，當時雖也頗受阻撓，而成績斐然，非議者也祗能默爾而息了。最近，美國各大學之設有婚姻科目者，已近六百校之多。</p>
<h3>回憶</h3>
<p>— 平苑</p>
<p>我的心本來是平靜的，沒有波濤，沒有激浪。但是「它」却飛來徘徊在我的身邊，輕柔地叩着我的心扉，向我耳邊一遍又一遍地低唱我已快要遺忘的舊歌。……我不能拒絕，只好允許它「祗一次」鑽進了我的心。</p>
<p>但是這僅僅一次，就決定了後日的煩惱。它不停地向我傾訴過去的愁恨，那些我費了極大苦心才忘去，才維持住了心理的平衡，但是，它用哀傷的聲調把這些都送到我的耳畔，又描繪着一羣我熟悉的面目，來啃嚙我的心。從此我失去了安寗。</p>
<p>是它，使我在漫長深夜，縈迴苦思，在淸醒的日裏，癡望着，失去了活潑的心情，忘掉了眼前的世界，腐蝕着自己—忽略了最眞實的現在，祗知道那被我有偏見的頭腦渲染得極美的過去……</p>
<p>「回憶」！這美麗而專制的魔王—我無法抗拒你，我甘願受你的作弄，但是，我還知道「過去」也是由「眞實」累積而成，讓那些美的，能鼓勵我的因素活在我心中；讓那些使我傷感的糾纏遠離我吧！</p>
<h3>曾孟樸軼事補</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>余營以曾先生逸事揭諸報章，復見海上各報述其瑣事者頗衆，因更補其未備。</p>
<p>先生晚歲息影虛籌園（俗稱曾園，在常熟九萬圩），廣栽花木，羅及泰西異種，萬紫千紅，如入衆芳國中。夏日荷花盛開，池畔遍設茶座，游屐恒滿。先生戴笠策杖，行吟其間；陶寫襟懷，寵辱皆忘。每夜復旦新茶傾入芙蕖花萼中，次晨烹以享客，其香沁鼻，雅事亦韻事也。</p>
<p>先生歿後，金松岑以孽海花爲彼首創，後乃由先生續成，因挽先生一詩，有：「香火緣深交誼淺，此情祗有夜星知」之句。復云：「盧後王前頗費辭」，斯則當特之後世傳文苑者，固不必亟亟爲之論定焉。</p>
<p>先生於淸光緒間中式舉人後，進京會試，相傳因試卷發墨而落第。先生自述，則因喪偶胸懷悒鬱，故不能終塲；試卷潑墨，實無其事。但里中傳聞，先生會得關中關節「元秘史」三字，因吿其密友某，復爲一人竊聽得之，先生與其密友皆下第，竊聽得者乃獨中巍科；今其人尙存，故不欲薯其姓氏。傳聞若是，安得起燕谷老人（續孽海花作者）於九原而證其說乎？然先生於科名利祿素澹泊，平生爲名公子賢宦；終乃兩袖淸風，負債累累，以文學不朽，不愧爲第一流文學家。以林琴南胡適之於文學見解之南轅北轍，乃交口譽孽海花無異詞云。</p>

<h3>National Assembly to Elect Vice President Today; Assembly Scheduled to Close Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold the vice presidential election at its plenary session on the morning of the 23rd. During the presidium meeting on the evening of the 22nd, Dai Chuanxian was designated to chair the morning session on the 23rd. The form of the vice presidential election ballot was also approved. The ballots are made of domestic paper, printed in regular script with red ink, and exquisitely designed. One side reads "Republic of China, April 23, Year 37, Vice Presidential Election Ballot, First Session of the First National Assembly." The other side lists the names of the vice presidential candidates: Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Li Zongren, Cheng Qian, Mo Dehui, and Xu Chuanlin. During the presidium meeting, Yu Xuezhong, Yu Bin, and Su Ting were designated to oversee the stamping and sealing of the ballots, with each ballot bearing the individual seals of Yu, Su, and Yu before being sealed. The sealed ballots will be publicly opened on the morning of the 23rd, and the votes will be counted immediately after the election. If no candidate receives more than half of the votes, the top three candidates will be selected first, and a second election will be held at 4:00 PM. Zhang Xiwen has been designated as the chairman for the afternoon session. If there is still no result, a third election will be held on the morning of the 24th. However, the assembly is still scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 24th. The election proceedings on the morning of the 23rd will be broadcast live by the Central Broadcasting Station starting at 10:30 AM. Seventy-five foreign guests will also be present to observe the proceedings. The method of counting votes for the vice presidential election was also discussed at the presidium meeting on the evening of the 22nd, and it was decided to change to a roll-call voting system, with the number of votes for each candidate displayed on the counting machine for each vote.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The first session of the First National Assembly, which has been in session for 25 days, is entering its final stage according to the schedule. However, it seems that both domestic and foreign observers have not lessened their close attention as the closing date of the assembly approaches, because the assembly still has the important task of electing a vice president, which will be held on the 23rd. According to the Constitution of the Republic of China, the position of Vice President is generally considered by most people to be</p>
<p>a position with authority but no real power. However, enlightened individuals are well aware that this seemingly powerless Vice President, in addition to fulfilling the responsibility of assisting the President during the six-year term, must also be ready to assume the President's powers under certain circumstances stipulated by the Constitution. Therefore, the importance of this responsibility is consistent with the high status of the position. According to Article 3 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the President and Vice President must be elected with a majority of the total number of representatives. Therefore, if no candidate receives more than half of the total number of representatives (the total number of National Assembly representatives in this session is 3,045, and more than half would be at least 1,523 votes) when the election results are announced at noon on the 23rd, then according to the provisions of paragraph 2 of the same article of the aforementioned Election and Recall Law, "the top three candidates with the most votes shall be re-voted to elect one." This is the second ballot. If no one still receives a majority of the votes, a "third ballot shall be held to elect one." If no one is elected, the two candidates with the most votes in the third ballot shall be re-voted, and the candidate with the most votes shall be elected. If the votes are tied, a new election shall be held, and the candidate with the most votes shall be elected.</p>

<h3>Assembly Continues to Pass Proposals; Calls on Compatriots at Home and Abroad to Rise Up and Suppress the Rebellion; Asks the Government to Effectively Protect Navigation Rights on Inland Rivers and Coastal Waters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Assembly continued to discuss proposals on the 22nd. The fifteenth plenary session was held at 9:30 AM, chaired by Li Zonghuang, representing the first group of the presidium. 1,670 representatives were present. After the secretariat reported the minutes of the fourteenth plenary session, the discussion of proposals began. The seventh review committee reported on 44 proposals related to the border areas, the first review committee reported on 145 proposals related to the constitution, and the second review committee reported on 124 proposals related to national defense. All were successfully passed in the morning according to the review opinions. During the process of passing 313 proposals rapidly in the morning, only the reports from the reporters and the chairman's announcement of "no objection" were heard. The assembly was calm and uneventful, and few representatives spoke. However, the issue of discussing permanent institutions in advance caused another wave in the meeting. A temporary motion was submitted for voting, but after two rounds of affirmative and negative votes, the proposal to change the agenda was rejected, and the meeting returned to calm after a quarter of an hour. After a ten-minute break, the discussion continued. Representative Ling Tie'an, who is blind, proposed that the President and Vice President should be inaugurated in the National Assembly Hall and take an oath to all National Assembly representatives. Since this exceeded the scope of the proposals being discussed, the chairman did not put it up for discussion and continued to announce the results of the review of the proposals, which were all passed without objection. Among the proposals were "a proposal to send a telegram to the whole country in the name of the National Assembly, calling on the people of the whole country to rise up and suppress the rebellion" and "a proposal to send a telegram in the name of this assembly to the whole country and overseas compatriots, unanimously supporting the national policy of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, and ordering the elected government to supervise and urge all military and civilian officials to rectify discipline, boost morale, and suppress the bandit rebellion within a time limit, recover lost territory, consolidate the foundation of the country, and comfort the people's expectations." Both were passed, and the telegrams were handed over to the secretariat to be drafted and then submitted to the assembly for approval. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Assembly continued its session at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd, chaired by Hu Jing'an. Only 1,350 representatives were present, which was less than the legal quorum. A discussion session was held first, and when the number of attendees reached 1,540 at 4:25 PM, the plenary session was resumed. The review reports on foreign affairs and economic proposals from the third and fourth review committees were read and passed item by item. Only the proposal submitted by Wu Tiansheng and others to compensate overseas Chinese for the national savings bonds purchased overseas with the original currency was changed from "submitted to the government for reference" to "submitted to the government for effective implementation." The rest were passed without objection. A total of 276 proposals were passed by 5:30 PM. Then, the review report of the first review committee on permanent institutions was discussed, but no result was reached, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The proposal submitted by Zhu Keqin and others that the government shall not open up inland river navigation rights for any reason in order to safeguard navigation rights and consolidate the foundation of the country was discussed and passed in the National Assembly on the 22nd. It was resolved to submit it to the government for effective attention. The method in the proposal specifically emphasized that the government should effectively safeguard navigation rights and shall not open up inland river and coastal navigation rights without authorization for any reason in order to safeguard navigation rights. Any country's request to open up and coastal navigation rights should be rejected. If any country encroaches on our inland river and coastal navigation rights, strong negotiations should be conducted based on international law. The ships of any country shall not enter our territorial waters without authorization, otherwise, they shall be regarded as enemy ships by the naval department and coastal fortresses and forcibly restrained.</p>
<h3>Permanent Institutions Unresolved; Dozens of National Representatives Cause Disturbance; Meeting Chairman Hu Jing'an Nearly Attacked</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly has been discussing proposals, and over 800 cases have been passed like a raging river in the past two days. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, the excitement of a small group of representatives on the podium nearly led to a fight. On the 22nd, the proposal on permanent institutions was discussed without a conclusion, and the time had expired. Chairman Hu Jing'an hastily announced the adjournment of the meeting. Dozens of representatives demanded "no objection to pass," but were not adopted. They raised their arms and shouted, swarming onto the podium to ask questions. The disturbance began. However, at this time, Chairman Hu had already left his seat and went to the back of the stage, intending to enter the presidium lounge to rest. He was dragged out of the small door in the left corner of the stage by three representatives. The representatives then gathered to criticize him, with some saying that the chairman was illegal and should not adjourn the meeting, some pointing their fingers at Hu's nose and angrily shouting, "You are not worthy of being the chairman," some scolding him in a friendly tone, and some banging on the table and shouting "Beat you." Hu originally intended to argue, but seeing that the situation was not good, he broke free and escaped to the small door in the right corner behind the stage. Led by Zhang Tingxun, a representative from Yun'nan Shun'ning who had previously served as the magistrate of Dali County, and Li Hongru, a union representative who had to work hard to attend after being a signatory representative for concession, dozens of representatives roared and chased after him, turning the entire stage into a mess. When some news reporters asked Zhang for his name, Zhang refused to answer and secretly hid his badge with his name and number in his pocket, and continued to pursue Hu. The reporters insisted on seeing his badge, and in the struggle, they tore off his badge, and only then did they know that it was Zhang Tingxun. At this time, Hu had disappeared in the meantime. Zhang then shifted his target, glared at the reporters, and nearly resorted to violence, arousing public outrage from the reporters present, who unanimously condemned him for being a disgrace to the assembly and immediately announced his name and number in public. Zhang knew he was in the wrong, and after asking for his badge back, he left the stage in embarrassment. The dispute gradually subsided, and the representatives under the stage gathered to discuss in small groups, with varying opinions. Some said that Zhang Tingxun had disgraced the assembly, some said that Hu Jing'an should be punished, and some said that the assembly staff had beaten the representatives. However, in the end, because there was no one to vent their anger on and they felt that the reporters were in the way, they had no choice. Liu Yiting then changed his mind and said, "If the issue of permanent institutions is not resolved tomorrow, I will never let him be elected." By 6:30 PM, the crowd began to disperse, and the turmoil came to an end.</p>
<h3>State Council Revises and Approves Supplementary Proposal for National Assembly Elections</h3>
<p>300 Additional Representatives for Occupational and Women's Groups</p>

<h3>Loan Doubts for Tea Processing and Marketing; Four Allied Banks to Provide Loans in Three Phases; Export Locations and Cased Tea Also Used as Collateral</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The 363rd meeting of the board of directors of the Four Allied Banks was held at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd, with Zhang Jia'ao acting as chairman. The meeting discussed the loan methods for tea processing and marketing this year. The banks believe that the previous tea loans have been effective in promoting exports and earning foreign exchange. In addition to the 80 billion yuan for tea production loans that have already been approved in the agricultural loan program, the banks have decided to continue providing loans for tea processing and marketing and export location cased tea loans, referring to past methods, in order to encourage tea merchants to raise their own funds to purchase raw tea, promote tea exports, and protect the outlet for tea produced by tea farmers. The main points of the loan terms are as follows: (1) The total loan amount is 4.9 billion yuan, divided into three phases of loans. The standards for each phase of loans are as follows: A. Raw tea processing loan: a maximum of 3 million yuan per dan (unit of weight). B. Cased tea marketing loan: a maximum of 4 million yuan per dan, deducting the processing loan. C. Export cased tea loan: 5 million to 8 million yuan per dan, deducting the marketing loan. (2) Target: Tea merchants who have a good track record in handling tea loans and foreign exchange settlement in the past should be selected as loan targets. When each factory applies for loans in each stage, the raw tea purchased with its own funds shall not be less than 100 dan, and the cooperative shall not be less than 50 dan. (3) Term: The processing loan is one month, the marketing loan depends on the distance of the route, and the maximum shall not exceed 30 days. The export cased tea loan is also one month. (4) Interest rate: A uniform monthly interest rate of 13%, and overdue payments will be calculated at the market interest rate. (5) Method of handling collateral: If the collateral for each phase of the loan does not meet the standards or the loan is not redeemed by the due date, the lending bank shall handle it by means of public auction and use the proceeds from the auction to repay the loan principal and interest. (6) The rediscount shall be made by the lending bank to the national bank at 90% of the amount. (7) Domestic and border sales tea shall be handled in principle by handling export bills. Another report: This year's large-scale farmland water conservancy project loans in various provinces have been approved for 750 billion yuan in the agricultural loan program. In order to speed up the construction during the current dry season, the board of directors decided today to select 25 new and old projects in ten provinces, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi, which have good economic value, sound engineering design, can be completed in a short period of time, have stable local order, and have sound construction institutions, and which are urgently needed to increase grain production, as well as annual maintenance projects in the three provinces of Ningxia, Chahar, and Suiyuan, for early loan processing in the first half of the year.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Proceedings: The Crowning Act</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] According to the established agenda, the crowning act of the First National Assembly's first session was the vice-presidential election on the 23rd. Before the opening of the assembly, Li Zongren was the first to announce his open candidacy for vice-president in Beiping. Cheng Qian, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, and Mo Dehui followed suit. Then, the Democratic Socialist Party put forward Xu Fulin, so the candidate announcement board listed six names side by side. The campaigning activities, with the start of the meeting, gathered in the capital from all over. Furthermore, they entered the venue ahead of schedule from outside the venue. The use of methods varied. The propaganda offensive, the emotional appeal, and the rational persuasion were all contests and comparisons of strength. On the eve of this election, all means were used. Flyers were flying around the meeting hall, slogans were all over the streets, advertisements filled the newspapers, and various cloth banners competed for attention. The sound of the radio constantly grabbed people's attention. The several candidates, virtual and real, generally expressed a principle, which was "equal strength."</p>
<p>Xu Fulin: Following the reverse order of the candidate announcement, let's first talk about Xu Fulin, who has the fewest co-signers. His announcement of his candidacy was a decision of the Democratic Socialist Party, to advance as a retreat, to avoid the Democratic Socialist Party's 140 votes being torn to pieces by others pulling them in different directions, and ultimately offending people. Mr. Xu said that he had no policy speech, and the vice-president should take the president's policy as his policy; at the same time, he had not hosted any banquets. On the contrary, when he led the Democratic Socialist Party members to the reception banquet, he repeatedly hoped that others would be elected, and at the dinner on the 21st, he said to Cheng Qian in person that he would provide the greatest support when necessary.</p>
<p>Mo Dehui: Mo Dehui participated in the election as a social worthy. Colleagues from the Political Participation Council and fellow villagers from Northeast and North China were his basic votes. His campaign was as humble and peaceful as his usual way of doing things. He hosted banquets, but not aggressively; he had two oil portraits, but they were not too large, and the colors were not too glaring; he shook hands with people with a smile, but he did not make people feel anxious; the most interesting thing was that his campaign cigarettes were also mild and pleasant. Mr. Liu's campaign was completely Eastern, so mature and prudent, with its own hidden strengths.</p>
<p>Cheng Qian: The spokesperson of Cheng Qian's campaign committee once declared: "The final victory will surely belong to the least eloquent but most honest person." Cheng Songyun's sincerity and simplicity moved the general opinion of the assembly. He appealed with no faction and transcendence of impartiality. He Chengjun, Tang Shiyao, Zhao Hengti, Fan Yushui, and Yan Huatang were all active for him. In addition to giving photos to the representatives, he used his "Yangfu Garden Poetry Collection" to make friends through literature, to harmonize emotions and build relationships. It is said that he has great strength in Central China, and he can also win over most of the military representatives, but the only thing that is inconsistent with Song Lao's campaign attitude is Gong Debai's National Salvation Daily, which automatically helps the election, and aims at Sun Ke, who has a prominent reputation.</p>
<p>Li Zongren: Li Zongren was the first to declare an open election. This general led a think tank to carry out various activities outside the venue, and his wife, Guo Dejie, represented the full effort to canvass votes in the venue. In terms of application, Li Zongren is the most talented. His first speech in Beiping took into account all aspects. Many Mongolian representatives still cherish his promise of welfare for border compatriots. They said that he does not make promises lightly. He used the weight of all aspects to increase his reputation. The praise of the ambassadors of various countries to China, the praise of professors and scholars, and the public opinion reflected by the newspapers in Pingjing and Hong Kong and the Chinese Public Opinion Survey Association were all used to spread countless explicit and implicit flyers throughout the assembly. Southwest and North China have his basic strength, and Miao and Yi compatriots also have deep trust in his past achievements and practical spirit. The overwhelming propaganda is used to win more votes.</p>
<p>Yu Youren: Yu Youren appealed with "poverty." At the same time, his past history made him naturally deeply rooted and thick in the campaign, so he was cautiously considering at first, and then came out in a dignified manner. But under the influence of the crowd, the old man had to start socializing in addition to giving poems and calligraphy. In the socializing, he discovered that the good causes planted decades ago have now become a strong support. Most of the border compatriots in Xinjiang and Tibet support him, and Shaanxi, Shanghai, and vocational groups all have his basic votes. The old man flaunts his demeanor. The huge oil portrait at the entrance of the Great Hall is a masterpiece of Shanghai's well-known young painter Song Zhenggu in one day. The old man said: "When I looked at my portrait, it made me love myself more. My name and my beautiful beard are the only ones that meet the standard of vice president." He also said: "These people participating in the election are not only not my political enemies, but my 'competition friends.' If I want to compete, it is only for the complete realization of a constitution."</p>
<p>Sun Ke: Finally, let's look at Sun Ke, who signed and nominated first among the candidates. According to the key members of his campaign team: "In the campaign activities, emotion should occupy a very important component, but if there is already a natural and deep emotion, there is no need to campaign, otherwise it is a waste of effort. What Vice Chairman Sun is doing is to awaken reason. He wants to use his own political and academic conditions to win in this occasion where emotions should not be used at all." This is Sun Ke's route. This is clearly shown in all his publicity materials and speeches at the banquets he hosts for representatives in batches every noon. Compared with the other five representatives, no one denies that Sun Ke is a big force. In addition to the basic votes from Guangdong and overseas, from the beginning, his strategy has been to use his self-confidence to win the trust of representatives from various regions and units. On his red and green slogans, it says that he is "a pioneer of democracy, a symbol of progress, an authority on international issues, and a leader in constitution-making." Objectively speaking, no representative thinks that this kind of propaganda is an exaggeration. On the contrary, he has gains after each banquet. Naturally, this kind of prominent momentum will be envied by political enemies. The National Salvation Daily fired at him, and several offensives made him declare that he would give up being elected as a legislator, because the suspicion of trying to have both fish and bear's paw was also cited and violently criticized by political enemies. Some people say that Yu, Li, and Cheng have united; there are even rumors that Sun Ke will become the vice president of the Kuomintang. On the eve of the election vote, Sun Ke suffered repeated surprise attacks, but what he did was still to awaken reason and express his determination to run for election.</p>
<p>Who Wins: The situation of the six candidates is generally like this today, but everyone is still spending their minds and energy to use every minute to win victory. Sun Ke's wife, Chen Shuying, a representative, is obviously a lot thinner. She still has to attend meetings every day to listen to intelligence and refute rumors for Sun Ke. Li Zongren's wife, Guo Dejie, a representative, sprained her back the day before yesterday, and she is still deploying troops in the venue every day, giving instructions in person; she is really planning strategies, but she always says "we have no way"! Yu Shi Lao stays up late to rush to write calligraphy, Cheng Songyun publishes poetry collections in newspapers, Mo Liu Lao is still steadily playing steadily without making a sound, and Xu Fulin is still carefree and indifferent.</p>
<p>But as things stand now, although flyers of various colors are flying all over the meeting place, the reliable votes are still reliable, and the unreliable votes have to wait and see what happens in the moment of raising a hand and writing. The general view is that there will be no result in the first election. The question is which three candidates will enter the rematch? Who is standing on three legs? But in any case, the general trend of the world has been set, and only two or three people are starting to prepare for the second vote. In the United States, the vice president can be obtained easily, but we have to fight three or four times. (April 22 in Nanjing)</p>

<h3>Commentary: Science in China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Hu Xiansu</p>
<p>——Thoughts on Returning from Attending the Central Research Institute Council Meeting</p>
<p>From March 25th to 27th, the 5th Congress of the 2nd Council of the National Central Research Institute was held in Nanjing. The most important task of this Congress was to elect academicians. First, at the 4th Congress in October last year, candidates for academicians were nominated. 150 people were nominated from more than 400 people submitted by various parties. They were all great Confucian scholars who have made significant contributions in mathematics, physics, biology, and humanities. After the nomination, the Academia Sinica officially announced it. Four months after the announcement, all the council members of this Congress formally elected a total of 81 people by secret ballot. After this rigorous and solemn nomination and election, the elected academicians are worthy of being the leaders of the academic community in our country today. Compared with other countries in the world, there is not much shame. Therefore, this election is an unprecedented event in the Chinese academic community.</p>
<p>The author is very excited to participate in this grand event, but looking at the national affairs today, I am sadly wanting to cry. Our country has no science. I remember that what I learned when I was studying as a child was still to study for the imperial examination. After the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Qing court abolished the imperial examination and established schools in 1905. Science from the West began to be taught in schools, but the schools were newly established, and the curriculum and equipment were very simple, and the teachers were especially lacking. I remember that when I went to study at the preparatory course of Peking University in the first year of Xuantong, the school hired foreign teachers at a high price to teach the courses taught in today's senior high schools. The students regarded them as gods. After a year, students were selected to study in the United States. In the first year of the Republic of China, the author also participated in this election. Since then, more and more students have gone to Europe and the United States to study. The students studying in the United States had the rise of the Science Society of China. Those who joined the association were very enthusiastic. After a few years, many students who returned to China taught at universities in the North and South Valleys, and Peking University and Southeast University were the most famous. Tsinghua School monopolized sending students to study in the United States. During this period, scientific research has gradually sprouted. The earliest established scientific research institutions were the Geological Survey led by Mr. Ding Wenjiang and Mr. Weng Wenhao. Mr. Bing Zhi and the author founded the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China in Nanjing. The professors of the science departments of various universities also competed to lead students to engage in research. In a few years, the foundation of scientific research in our country was established. In 1927, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the National Government established the Central Research Institute and established various research institutes. With this academic institution to lead the country, academic research has made continuous progress. In less than ten years, Chinese scientists have made great contributions in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, meteorology, biology, physiology, medicine, and agronomy, which are enough to be comparable to the advanced scientific countries in Europe and the United States. Even our country's inherent philology, linguistics, middle school, and archeology have made epoch-making contributions after being influenced by Western scientific methods. Foreign scientists who were previously regarded as unattainable have become their own colleagues. In just 30 years, there are Chinese science and Chinese scientists in the world. The history of science can record that a certain important invention is the contribution of a certain Chinese scientist. China has been able to move from an old and backward country in the 18th century to the ranks of advanced countries in the 20th century. Thinking back to the difficulties of pioneering the road in the past, there are those who cannot help but cry with joy.</p>
<p>The Academia Sinica has been established for 20 years, and then there was the election of academicians. Under careful preparation, these famous scholars, less than a hundred in number, won the lifelong honor recognized by the whole country, which seems to be a manifestation of the government's emphasis on science. However, at this time when the flames of war are raging and wars are raging, it is still doubtful whether the government really knows how to value science. Especially at the opening ceremony of this conference, the government officials who delivered speeches did not understand the status of the elected academicians in the world academic community. The immature speech made people feel disdain. The lack of understanding of science by those in power and the usual disregard for the progress of domestic science are also clearly revealed here. Instead, let's look at the situation of science in the Soviet Union? The Soviet Academy of Sciences (approximately equivalent to the Academia Sinica in our country) was founded by Peter the Great in 1725, taking the Royal Society of England as its model. In 1925, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union seized power and renamed it the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Since then, the government has supported it with all its strength, which is far beyond the comparison of other countries. It has the functions of both the Royal Society of England and the Science and Industry Research Institute. The scope of research includes not only science but also language, literature, philosophy, history, economics, and law. There are 139 "academicians" and 198 corresponding academicians, all of whom are academic authorities. Their election is more difficult than that of members of the Royal Society of England. Another point that is different from the Royal Society of England is that once the academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is elected, in addition to his regular salary, he can also get another 3,000 rubles per month, and the corresponding academician can get another 1,500 rubles per month. In addition to this, they can also enjoy generous clothing and food rations, and can buy supplies in special stores that are not available in ordinary stores. They can also enjoy special discounts when shopping in ordinary stores. They have cars, comfortable houses in the city for each person, and villas surrounded by orchards in the countryside. There is a magnificent sanatorium of the Academy of Sciences near Moscow, so that its academicians and their families can rest for one month to six weeks during the summer vacation. There is another equally magnificent sanatorium on the Black Sea coast. The academician of the Academy of Sciences has the right to manage the various scientific research institutes and is a government academic advisor. The Academy of Sciences manages 57 research institutes, 16 research rooms, 15 museums, 31 committees, 73 libraries, 35 research stations, and 7 academic societies. In 1945, there were a total of 4,213 people engaged in scientific work in the Academy of Sciences, 600 graduate students, technicians, research room assistants, librarians, secretaries, and accountants were not included. The library of the Academy of Sciences has a collection of more than 10 million volumes. There is a bookstore of the Academy of Sciences and a printing house of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. The budget of the Academy of Sciences from 1945 to 1946 was 200 million rubles.</p>
<p>On June 15, 1945, the Soviet Academy of Sciences celebrated its 220th anniversary. There was a rumor about this since April, and then preparations were gradually made. The scale of its planning was rare. On the day, there were more than 1,000 representatives, including 145 academicians, 201 corresponding academicians, and 122 foreign scientists. The rest were all Soviet scientists. The opening ceremony was extremely grand, and the government's hospitality was extremely generous. The speeches, academic conferences, travel, and visits lasted for two weeks. After the commemorative meeting, the national newspapers still narrated the Academy of Sciences for several months. The Soviet Union's emphasis on science can be seen from this. It is no exaggeration to say that the Soviet Union regards science as religion. This is why the Soviet Union's science is developed, its national strength is strong, and it has jumped to become one of the two largest powers in the world in just 20 years.</p>
<p>Our government must not know the importance of science. Chairman Chiang repeatedly shouted during the Anti-Japanese War, "Without science, there is no national defense, and without national defense, there is no country." Every year on National Day, there is a Science Movement Week, and lectures are given everywhere to promote the importance of science. But our country's emphasis on science stops here. As for the actual situation, science is regarded as a luxury that has nothing to do with the fate of the country and the nation. The Central Research Institute and the research institutes of various universities have extremely exhausted funds, so that the famous scientists in our country have the sigh of heroes being useless. The treatment of scientists is not even as good as that of a government business agency worker! As a result, young scientists in our country would rather study abroad than return to China. It is heartbreaking to use Chu talents in Jin. And the dignified Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan said in his speech at the opening ceremony of the Central Research Institute that after the election of academicians this time, he hoped that China's scientific research could follow foreign masters and doctors. Is it not like looking for fish from a tree if such a country wants to talk about "Without science, there is no national defense, and without national defense, there is no country"? Alas!</p>
<h3>Bandit Raids Cross the Jing River in Shaanxi, Joint Defense Deployment Completed in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Xi'an on the 22nd] According to military news, the bandit chief Peng Dehuai is currently in Yangjiapo, northeast of Gouyi, commanding the battle in the Jing River basin. The main force crossing the river is the First Column Zhang Zongxun, the Second Column Wang Zhen, and a part of the Fourth Column Wang Shitai, totaling only several thousand people. Contact has occurred in Zhaogong Town, Tiandu Town, and other places northwest of Wugong. There is no major change in Qian County. Some observers believe that the bandits are only harassing in nature. The national army is gathering in large numbers and can repel the bandits in that area within two days. In addition, the bandits besieged Luochuan for more than a month and failed to succeed. The main force of their Third Column has collapsed and fled to the northeast, and the defending army is pursuing them.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Chengdu on the 22nd] The situation on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei is recently more tense. Xunyang and Baihe in southern Shaanxi have fallen.

<h3>Military Observers Point Out: Withdrawal from Yan'an Based on Strategy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 22nd] Well-informed military observers here believe that the National Army's withdrawal from Yan'an is a prelude to a combined offensive with changes on all fronts in the near future. This move has obviously broken the original plan of the Communist Party, which originally intended to use the capture of Yan'an as an excuse for its propaganda. Now the government takes the initiative to abandon Yan'an based on strategic plans, which is different from the Communist Army's capture of the city. Observers also believe that the abandonment of Yan'an is related to the government's recent strategic plan to abandon isolated strongholds. Military personnel also pointed out the following points: (1) The abandonment of Yan'an indicates that the National Army's spring offensive is about to launch. (2) The government would not have abandoned it so quickly if it was not sure that it would recapture Yan'an. (3) The government's abandonment of Yan'an was obviously not an action taken under pressure. Observers also pointed out that the National Army's occupation of Yan'an a year and a month ago was important because the area was the political center of the Communist Party, not because the area was a strategic point. If necessary, the government will still hold isolated strongholds, which can be proved by the fact that Changchun and Shenyang are still in the hands of the National Army. Based on the above reasons, observers believe that the active abandonment of Yan'an is part of a predetermined strategic plan.</p>

<h3>Committee on the Disposal of Sino-American Relief Supplies to End in June-July; US Representatives Hope for Price Controls</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] According to Chen Guangyuan, the full-time officer of the Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan's Committee for the Disposal of American Relief Supplies: The United States has provided 175,000 tons of food aid to China. As of now, 75% has arrived, and the remaining quarter is being transported to central China in succession. It is expected to arrive in China by the end of June. After all the food arrives, it can maintain the rationing in five cities until June. In addition, there is still a portion of medicine and fertilizer among the relief supplies, which will be shipped before the end of June. The committee will end its work at the end of June according to regulations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd dispatch] Mordi, the deputy director of the US delegation to the Sino-American Relief Supplies Disposal Committee, read a work report drafted by the director of the delegation, Patrick, at the Rotary Club luncheon on the 22nd. The report stated that the delegation's work will end between June and July of this year. The delegation was established based on the Sino-American Relief Agreement signed last year, aimed at handling the remaining relief supplies left in China by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), mainly to use the relief food to promote the rationing system in major cities. Mr. Patrick pointed out in the article that experts believe that China should have accurate statistics on its domestically produced and imported food. Domestic war is unavoidable. In order to exert its full power, the government should strive to improve the actual use of its self-produced and imported essential necessities, supplemented by appropriate price controls, and thoroughly reorganize the distribution mechanism to modernize it in order to achieve the goal of making the best use of everything.</p>

However, the Chinese representative stated that these cities are outside the control area of the Chinese central government and said that as soon as these territories are recovered from the CCP, relief supplies will be transported to these places. The Executive Committee of the International Children's Emergency Fund is scheduled to continue discussing the report of the Program Committee on April 28.</p>

<p>[Our dispatch] London 22nd broadcast: Rome news, Pope Pius XII issued a statement today on the end of the Italian election, stating that the victory of the democratic forces in Italy has greatly enhanced the confidence of Europe and the world.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 22nd dispatch] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi announced today that Italy has applied to join the Western European anti-communist alliance. Gasperi's announcement adds an assistant to the US, British, and French side in the "Cold War" between European democracies and communists. Only five countries, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, were originally allied with the Western European Union. Italy is the first country to apply to join. In addition to announcing its intention to participate in the Western European Union, Gasperi also hopes to revise the peace treaty. The Italian Prime Minister also promised that his new government will make major improvements to land issues.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st dispatch] The permanent agency of the Western European Union will discuss the issue of Italy joining the five-nation Western European Union at its first meeting in London on Saturday. London diplomatic circles believe that the victory of the anti-communist parties in Italy's election has cleared the path for Italy to join the five-nation alliance. Since the end of the war, no foreign election has interested London more than this Italian election. Churchill said at a meeting of the Conservative Party on the 21st that Italy has temporarily spared itself from Stalin's Bolshevik dictatorship by its own efforts. Italy has now regained its position as a major European power, no longer like other unfortunate countries that have to live in the same cage as behemoths.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 21st dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference that he had no knowledge of the rumor that the United States had spent $4 million on the Italian election campaign under the "X Anti-Communist Plan."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 22nd dispatch] The new Italian parliament is now scheduled to convene on May 8, elect a president two days later, and then the president will appoint a prime minister to form a new cabinet. It is expected that the position of prime minister will belong to the current prime minister, Gasperi.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 21st dispatch] Now that the Christian Democrats have gained an advantage in the general election, Gasperi said that he will unite with other anti-communist parties to form a stronger right-wing base government. Gasperi delivered a speech today on the balcony of the Christian Democratic Party headquarters here, saying that he will serve democracy with his strength and will reach agreements with other non-communist parties on foreign policy and all matters that contribute to Italy's true restoration. Gasperi stressed that the Christian Democratic Party opposes the implementation of dictatorship by any faction and advocates adopting a foreign policy that is sufficient to cause economic cooperation with nations stronger than Italy and unity with all free and democratic peoples. Gasperi also said that the Christian Democratic Party will, based on its majority in parliament, implement the two major goals of agricultural land reform and relief for unemployment under the conditions of maintaining freedom, respecting freedom, and maintaining the absolute need for independence. Gasperi finally said, "We Catholics are willing to maintain the independence of the church, and our responsibility is to maintain respect for the Pope."</p>
<h3>Italian Communists Denounce Unfree Elections; Declare No Intention to Resort to Force; Future Trends of the Communist International Are Extremely Noteworthy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 22nd dispatch] Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti delivered a speech today to the Anglo-American press conference in Rome, pointing out that the election was full of malpractices, but declaring that the Communist Party did not intend to use force. Togliatti said that the political situation in Italy is very serious and tense. The government is in power by foreign interference, intimidation, and fraud. If we do not accept the election results, it is because we intend to use violence to expel the government that has used violence against the people, then we have no intention of doing so. The use of force, regardless of the outcome, is detrimental to the country and will eventually lead to the loss of its independence. But we will still maintain the demand for free elections so that the people can engage in elections without being interfered with by foreign wars and famine, and intimidated by the church.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd dispatch] A US official said today that the failure of the Italian Communist Party to come to power shows that the Soviet Union's attempt to expand its red control in Europe beyond the Iron Curtain has failed. International communism is now facing an important decision: whether to endure setbacks and wait for opportunities to persevere by political means, or to resort to force at this time.</p>

In addition to requesting the British to compensate the families of the deceased Soviet airmen and the loss of the damaged Soviet aircraft, the report pointed out that after the wreckage of the Soviet aircraft fell into the British military zone, the British had changed the position of the fragmented wreckage several times. The report also advocated the regulation of new air transport methods, requiring British and American aircraft to apply for permission from the Soviet authorities one day before each flight in the air corridor between Berlin and the West to avoid unfortunate incidents. The report also said that before detailed measures to ensure the safety of air transport are in place, night flights over the corridor, or flights when the sky is cloudy and aircraft cannot be seen from the ground, should be completely prohibited.</p>

<h3>U.S. House Committee Submits Report: Soviet Military Production Needs Increase; Forrestal Proposes Compromise Plan for Military Expansion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast: Washington dispatch: The committee specially established by the House of Representatives for foreign aid issues, led by Republican Congressman Herter, submitted a report to Congress today stating that the Soviet Union's capacity to produce military equipment is greater than before the war. The claim that the Soviet Union's strength is not substantial and that it cannot engage in large-scale military operations when needed is obviously inaccurate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The House Select Committee on Foreign Aid recently issued a document stating that the Soviet Union's defense budget for 1948 was 66.2 billion rubles, which is 51% higher than in 1940.</p>

Since Congress and the Army, Navy, and Air Force had a dispute over Forrestal's plan for 55 Air Force groups, the Senate Armed Services Committee had requested a revised plan. Air Force officials strongly advocated expanding to 70 groups, while President Truman supported Forrestal's idea. The new plan submitted by Forrestal to Congress still calls for the enactment of conscription laws for those aged 19 to 25 as soon as possible and the adoption of universal military training, but the revised part of the plan focuses on changes in the requested number of Air Force units.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits Hidden in Yangshupu Power Plant; "Six Parties" Organization Cracked; Plot to Create a Dark Shanghai Exposed; Police Department Arrests Eleven People Who Confessed the Gathering and Action Details</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters announced yesterday: At the end of last month, someone put iron filings into the generator of the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which almost caused a city-wide power outage. Fortunately, it was discovered on the evening of April 1, and the company tried its best to repair it, and it was resolved. After the incident, the security authorities paid close attention and, after many investigations, finally solved the case. It was confirmed that the communist bandits attempted to destroy the city's main power generation machines, create terror, and cause hundreds of thousands of workers to lose their jobs in order to create a chaotic situation. So far, Wu Shishen, Wang Xiaohe (from Zheng County), Wu Guozhen (from Guangcheng), Tan Asi, Song Changgeng (from Huai'an), Tang Lansheng (from Shanghai), Feng Renzhong, Huang Hongdong, Shi Jingen (from Shanghai), Dai Shougen (from Yixing), Gu Rongsheng and other eleven people have been arrested. The following is an excerpt of the confessions of the main culprits in the case, Wang Xiaohe and Wu Guozhen:</p>
<p>Confession of Wang Xiaohe, Director of the Labor Union</p>
<p>Wang Xiaohe, 25 years old, from Yin County, Zhejiang, a worker in the third shift of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, currently a director of the Labor Union.</p>
<p>Question: Did you preside over the destruction of the machine with iron filings in the Yangshupu Power Plant?</p>
<p>Answer: It was based on the second gathering, and a person surnamed Shen told me to do it.</p>
<p>Question: Please state the details of the second gathering.</p>
<p>Answer: The first time was at Xu Zhouliang's house in Hongzhen, around March 26. There were more than ten participants. They were all dissatisfied with the Shanghai arrests of workers this time and unanimously demanded action to show it, but no resolution was reached. The second time was at Wu Shishen's house. The participants included Shen Hongsheng, Wu Shishen, Huang Hongxun, Wang Xiaohe, and Feng Renzhong. I mentioned that if we wanted to destroy the machine, we could use bombs. At that time, Huang Hongxun opposed it, thinking that it would not gain social sympathy and that we should mobilize the masses to strive for it. After the meeting, Shen Hongsheng told me that if we were to take action in the future, he would send someone to contact me and set a secret code "AA." Two days later, Shen Hongsheng sent someone to my house and asked me to find a way to put iron filings in the DC shaft. If the machine exploded, the workers would leave the factory and petition the government. Later, I found Jiang Xinggen, a worker in the canopy department, and asked him to do this. Because he was timid, he refused to do it. I then found Wu Guozhen, an oil room worker, and Zhang Shibao (a coppersmith) to do it, and they agreed. On the night of March 30, Zhang Shibao found the iron filings, and Wu Guozhen put them into the shaft. It was discovered at 10 pm on April 1 because the thing that was put in was coarse sand (i.e., iron filings), so it did not explode.</p>
<p>Question: In the Yangshupu Power Plant, there is a core communist organization called the "Six Parties." Who are those people?</p>
<p>Answer: There are Wu Shishen, Huang Hongxun, Feng Renzhong, Tan Asi, Shen Hongsheng, and myself, six people in total. We have a meal together once a week to discuss the situation in the factory, which is the responsibility of Shen Hongsheng.</p>
<p>Confession of Wu Guozhen, an Oil Filler</p>
<p>Wu Guozhen, from Yancheng, Jiangsu, 25 years old, an oil filler in the Shanghai Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>Question: On March 30, someone put fine sand under the DC oil cover. Wang Xiaohe said: Zhang Shibao gave you the fine sand and you put it in.</p>
<p>Answer: Zhang Shibao said to me: I want you to put the iron filings in. I didn't want to do this at first, but then Wang Xiaohe said to me: You are a very good child. You were very good in the old labor union in the past. Now you must do this action because the government is arresting many of our workers, and we have to show the government some color. Under his enticing words, my will wavered, so I accepted his drive. Zhang Shibao gave me a bag of iron filings and asked me to put it in four machines, but at that time I was being condemned by my conscience, so I only put it in two, and then I told them that all of them were put in. In fact, I only put in two. When I put them in, Zhang Shibao kept watch, and someone would wave his hand as a signal, and I would put it down immediately.</p>
<p>Question: When did Wang Xiaohe call you to join the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Answer: When Ouyang Zurun ran away.</p>
<p>Question: Where did you join?</p>
<p>Answer: In Huishan Park. Wang Xiaohe contacted me to join.</p>

<h3>Captain Wanli Arrives in Tianjin; Will Sail to Rescue Passengers Today; Bandit Side Agrees to Release Personnel and Return Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] Wanli ship captain Sha Yunren flew from Qingdao to Peiping on the 21st and will go to Tianjin today.

(2) All personnel will be released, but they must be inspected. (3) Personal luggage and goods will be returned in full, but items of military use will be detained. (4) Technical matters concerning the rescue mission. Sha also said: The safety of the passengers is not a problem.

As for the ship itself, the local authorities have indicated that they can send people to repair it, and Fumin is prepared to send people from Qingdao. Accompanying Sha are Fumin staff member Wang Yucai, passenger family representative Feng Youshen, and others, four people in total.</p>
<h3>Ship Captain Sha Talks About His Experience</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 22nd] Wanli ship captain Sha Yunren arrived in Tianjin today and said that the Wanli ship arrived near Hailu Island at 8:45 am on the 12th, a quarter of a nautical mile from Guoshi Reef.

Sha said: The Wanli has sailed this line three times, and there is no reef on the nautical chart.</p>
<h3>Wanli Ship Passengers Still Stranded in Rongcheng</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Peiping, 22nd] The 1,234 passengers on the Wanli ship are currently temporarily residing in villages near Rongcheng Bay on the coast of Rongcheng County, where villagers provide food and accommodation. The local area is barren and can only supply sweet potatoes and cornmeal buns. The passengers automatically form large teams, medium teams, and small teams, and the life is united. In addition to the more than 100 crew members on the ship, the maximum number of passengers was originally set at 464, and the rest did not buy tickets. According to Captain Sha Yunren's estimate, the amount of legal tender carried on the ship reached about 300 billion.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 22nd] Wanli ship captain Sha Yunren arrived in Tianjin on the 22nd. The Great Wall ship decided to sail to Rongcheng Bay on the 23rd or 24th carrying medicine and nutritious food to rescue the stranded passengers, and representatives of the families decided to stop going there.</p>
<h3>Volunteers Request Advance Payment of Settlement Allowance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] There are many people registering for volunteer soldiers in the districts of this city, and many of them directly go to the two Civil Affairs Bureaus and the Military Service Association to apply for registration as volunteer soldiers, requesting preferential treatment and advance payment of settlement allowance (seeking shop guarantees) before enlisting. Among them, a citizen named Li Meifu at 1160 Nanjing Road requested that the Public Utilities Bureau be asked to issue a license for a business tricycle so that his family could operate it in Shanghai, and the monthly rental income would be used to maintain household expenses, and he could serve with peace of mind. There are many similar requests. Secretary of the Military Service Association, Shu Kenan, said yesterday that volunteer soldiers in various districts should apply for registration with the local district security office to wait for enlistment. The association is assisting the military service agencies and does not handle registration matters. Regarding letters from volunteer soldiers requesting preferential treatment, they will not be replied to. However, in the future, after volunteer soldiers register and enlist, if there are any requests, they will be assisted as much as possible in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations.</p>

<h3>Suspected Traitor; Returned for Retrial; "Leather King" Surrenders and is Detained</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Huanzhang, the "Leather King," was accused of being a suspected traitor. The High Court recently summoned Gu to court for questioning, and the court ordered him to be temporarily detained and tried in court on the 27th. Gu was the director of Gongyi Leather Factory and chairman of the Pseudo Leather Industry Association during the enemy-puppet period. Tang Shoukun, Hong Zhaoming and others previously reported to the garrison headquarters that Gu had the crime of helping the enemy with leather, and the High Prosecutor's Office investigated and prosecuted him. During the trial in the High Court, a certain agency suddenly sent a letter proving that Gu surrendered to a certain agency in May 34 with Tang Tangming, chief of staff of the Jiangnan Self-Defense Army, carrying 4 Mauser pistols and 10 bullets, and the court ruled that he was allowed to surrender and was exempted from punishment. Chief Judge Liu of the High Court acquitted Gu based on the letter and ordered him to be released after four well-established shops opened for him. The complainants Tang Shoukun and others expressed their dissatisfaction with this ruling and made several points to the High Prosecutor's Office. At the same time, the Supreme Court also considered that there were still doubts about the case and returned it for retrial. Judge Xiao summoned the guarantor to court.

<h3>The Mystery of Yang Jingzhou's Disappearance: Father-in-law's Inquiry in Taiwan Yields No Results; Murder at Sea Suspected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yang Jingzhou, manager of the Huaxi Hollywood Candy Factory in Shanghai, accepted a position at the 61 Candy Factory in Taiwan. He mysteriously disappeared on the Minsheng Company's Minzhong Steamer on his return journey after several days. Details were published in this newspaper on the 21st. After this bizarre event occurred, the family was extremely anxious. His father-in-law, Yan Shaotang, took the Hualian Steamer to Taiwan on the 16th to inquire, returning to Shanghai on the same vessel yesterday. According to him, he returned without any useful information after two days in Taiwan. The 61 Candy Factory is managed by the Xingtai Company. The factory site is very remote. Although the scale is not small, the equipment is very dilapidated. People in the factory said that Yang Jingzhou arrived in Taiwan on April 5th and went to the factory that evening. The next day, he inspected the factory equipment and discussed sugar production plans. On the 7th, he tried to produce mercerized sugar. On the morning of the 8th, he went out to visit friends and returned late in the evening, saying around 10 p.m. that he had a fever and chills. Factory staff accompanied him to the Guting Hospital for treatment. On the 9th, he went out again and did not return that night. On the morning of the 10th, he returned after breakfast, saying he would return to Shanghai. He then left the factory and never returned, leaving behind a gray coat and a coffee-colored canvas handbag. Yang Jingzhou disappeared halfway after boarding the ship. Whether he accidentally fell into the sea or was murdered has become a perplexing case. However, in the leather bag he left on the ship, a notebook contained the phrases "I am entering the tiger's den" and "Father, Father, is there salvation or not, the great number of life and death." Furthermore, according to fellow passengers, Yang was surrounded by several people when he boarded the ship, who took his ticket away. This clearly indicates that Yang knew in advance that he was in a dangerous situation. However, Yang himself was always taciturn and studious and had no enemies. Moreover, it was his first time in Taiwan, and he had no rea       Why would anyone want to take his life? In addition to grief, his family feels at a loss and deeply hopes that the security authorities in Shanghai and Taiwan can thoroughly investigate the matter to</p>

<h3>Private Trade Delegation; Two Groups to Japan on Schedule</h3>
<p>General Observation: Difficult to Develop</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The second group of private trade representatives to Japan will depart in batches on the 27th of this month and the 8th of next month. It is reported that the Allied Headquarters (GHQ) is quite unfamiliar with our country's current import and export management methods and hopes that our government can provide formal information for reference. Zeng Jiyin, a merchant representative who went to Japan previously, also made this request to relevant ministries and commissions when he went to Beijing. In the future, our country may submit a list of goods allowed for import and export to Japan to dispel the doubts of the Allied Headquarters. According to the observation of qualified personnel, the current private trade with Japan is a restricted barter arrangement, and expansion is unlikely. For example, Japanese textile machinery can be manufactured and imported into our country in large quantities, but the Allied Headquarters' condition for exchange is that our country must supply a large amount of coal and iron to enable it to continue production, just as Britain exports large quantities of Indian cotton to Japan in exchange for Japanese-made fabrics. It is currently difficult for our country to achieve this.</p>

<h3>Absorbing Idle Funds, Combating Speculation and Hoarding: National Treasury Bills to be Issued Soon; Director of the National Bank's Economic Research Department Comments</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] With the issuance of short-term treasury bills for the 37th year imminent, Ji Chaoding, Director of the Economic Research Department of the National Bank, expressed his personal observations on the significance of the bill issuance as follows: (1) In principle, short-term treasury bills absorb idle funds based on market interest rates to combat speculation and hoarding. Because hoarding entails interest losses, hoarders will suffer if the price increase rate cannot keep up with the interest rate. Therefore, the issuance of treasury bills will increase the cost burden of speculators and can shift the direction of idle funds. (2) The issuance of short-term treasury bills is different from usury. It is only a market interest rate calculated in currency. Because it can suppress speculation and hoarding, it also has the effect of stabilizing interest rates. At the same time, the current idle funds come in and out of the hands of speculators. Even if the government does not absorb them, legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises cannot use them. Therefore, the argument that the government is competing with industrial and commercial enterprises for funds is specious. (3) The issuance of short-term treasury bills will not affect the deposit business of silver and money shops. Because the deposits of today's silver and money shops are all current account, and have no savings significance, those who truly save have switched to saving in the form of material goods. The issuance of short-term treasury bills will open a path for savers, but it will not affect the deposit business of silver and money shops.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, took a flight to Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday. It is rumored that this trip is related to the issuance of short-term treasury bills. According to news from the securities industry, the procedures for issuing short-term treasury bills have been largely decided, and the timing will be next week. Brokers are prepared for trading and estimate that they may appear on the exchange at an 85% discount.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Rice Prices Reported Declining, Rice Prices Unanimously Dropping, Strong Selling Pressure in Coarse Grain and Oil Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was characterized by a decline in Wuxi. The morning opening continued the sluggishness of the previous day and fell again. Shops in this street were idle and did not replenish from the market, resulting in extremely slow sales. The market was weak and prices dropped. The price drop in the North City Market was greater than that in the South City Market. White indica rice and early rice fell by 150,000 yuan each, while Xian rice and thin rice fell by slightly less than 100,000 yuan. Special high-quality indica rice retreated to 4,050,000 yuan. In the South City Market, thick indica rice, early thin rice, and Xian rice all fell by 100,000 yuan. The People's Livelihood Bureau did not sell rice yesterday. The total arrival of goods in the two markets was approximately 4,183 stones.</p>
<p>Flour dealers were inactive and sales in this street were sluggish. The market was weak and could not recover. Old Car Flour opened at only 1,380,000 yuan. Seeing the low price, the factory bought in, and the price rose to 1,390,000 yuan. The closing price retreated slightly to 1,385,000 yuan, a slight drop of 5,000 yuan. Bingchuan fell by 20,000 yuan. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour fell by 30-40,000 yuan each. Bran large bags fell by 30,000 yuan. Small bags opened at 617,000 yuan. The factory price of wheat decreased by 50,000 yuan to 2,020,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Coarse grains generally declined. The cessation of purchases by dealers caused sales to be sluggish. Transactions were sporadic, and prices fell amid pessimistic sentiment. Soybeans fell by 100,000 yuan. Corn prices in Qingdao were reported to be low, and customer interest decreased, falling by 100,000 yuan. High-quality corn fell by 50-60,000 yuan. Red sorghum was not actively traded, falling by 60-70,000 yuan. Sesame from Tianjin was not purchased, falling sharply by 300-400,000 yuan, with few inquiries. Shelled peanuts had limited interest from dealers in Guangdong, falling sharply by 600-700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The edible oil market was in a slump. The opening price decreased by more than 100,000 yuan amid strong selling pressure. This was due to the fall in rice and oilseed prices, and sentiment could not be sustained. Soybean oil traded at the lowest price of 8,300,000 yuan amid continuous selling of returned goods, a drop of approximately 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. The price drop of crude oil was even greater. Qingdao Jibing crude oil fell to a closing price of 9,550,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 250,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by slightly more than 100,000 yuan. Crude sesame oil fell by more than 200,000 yuan. Small batch sesame oil retreated to within 80 million yuan. Bean cakes were sold more than purchased, falling by 20-30,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sales Still Sluggish, Yarn and Cloth Continue Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market remained in a stalemate. Only 16-count yarns of various grades saw some sales in local stores, and prices were slightly firm. The rest of the grades continued to trade in small volumes. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix immediately fell to 230 million yuan. Although it was absorbed by the duplicating industry and briefly rose to 233 million yuan, it eventually fell back due to oversupply, closing at the opening price, down 4 million yuan. 42-count Baoguang and Shuiyue also fell by another 3-4 million yuan. 40-count and 32-count yarns of various grades all fell by a small amount, ranging from 1 million to 4 million yuan.

There were 840 purchase applications, of which 24 from manufacturers bought 1,370 bolts of cloth, and the rest were purchased by cloth dealers.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was quiet because prices in producing areas were slightly high, and suppliers were scarce. There were few offers in the market, and owners were reluctant to sell. The Flower Management Committee [Hua Guan Hui] slightly increased the purchase price. Some retailers, pressured by finances, sold off slightly. Sentiment remained high, so trading was not active.

<h3>Wool Textile Industry Association Requests Exemption from Adjusting Wool Tax</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association believes that the wool goods tax has been adjusted monthly since January of this year, with the May adjustment approaching. It has sent a letter to the Goods Tax Bureau, listing two reasons, requesting a temporary exemption from the adjustment to maintain business during difficult times: (1) Woolen goods sales are sluggish in the summer, and market prices are often 30% lower than factory prices. Factories have no choice but to lower prices to maintain operations. (2) The raw material quota allocation is less than one-fifth of the actual usage, and the increase rate of raw material prices is much higher than that of finished products. Therefore, if taxes are increased again, prices will increase again, leading to even slower sales, which will affect tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The areas for currency exchange for Northeast circulation currency entering customs were originally limited to Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). Subsequently, in response to actual needs, Qingdao, Jinan, and Xi'an have been added. Further additions may be considered.</p>
<p>If Shenghui funds have legitimate purposes, there is no limit of 200 million, 1 billion, or 10 billion, but reasons and explanations must be provided for approval.</p>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Treasury [Si Lian Zong Chu] has stipulated a gradual adjustment method for deposit interest rates. The original deposit interest rates will be gradually adjusted, aiming to approach market interest rates after a considerable period.</p>
<p>For exports of frozen eggs to the UK, the China Trust Bureau has purchased the sixth batch, totaling 805 tons. The advance payment price will be determined within days. The bureau has now decided to export the first batch of 1,190 tons this year and has scheduled shipment to the UK at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Although the Central Trust Bureau raised the purchase price of tung oil this Monday, the market price also increased accordingly, resulting in the purchase price still being significantly different from the black market price. Therefore, oil merchants have not applied for purchases recently.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Financial Administration continues to conduct inspections of bank operations, but recently, the focus is on follow-up inspections, and fewer specialized inspections are being conducted.</p>

<h3>Methods for Increasing National Education Funding Passed by the Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministries of Finance and Education, in order to seek ways to increase revenue and prevent corruption in national education funding and to maintain it, drafted methods for consolidating and increasing local national education funding, submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan invited the Ministries of Education, Finance, Food, and Interior to hold a meeting to review and amend the methods, which were then passed at the 52nd meeting of the Executive Yuan today. The main points of the methods are recorded as follows: (1) National schools and central national schools (hereinafter referred to as national schools) should, according to law, be affiliated with the county government. Their funding should be incorporated into the county budget for unified allocation, and the county government should, in accordance with constitutional provisions and considering local actual conditions, gradually increase the funding to enrich it. (2) National schools should, in accordance with regulations, earnestly raise funds. Those that have already raised funds should complete the donation procedures within a time limit to determine ownership. (3) If the county-level finances are insufficient to cover the operating expenses of national schools, the following methods should be used to increase revenue: (A) With the resolution of the county council and the approval of the provincial government, a "grain for education" donation can be organized. The donation rate and implementation methods of the grain for education donation should be determined by the county government based on the needs of local national schools, the people's wealth, and their ability to bear the burden, and submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation, and reported to the Ministries of Finance and Education for record. This does not apply to counties and cities in the pacification zone. (B) Fifty percent of the income from public property and the income from production in townships should be allocated to the operating expenses of national schools. (C) The above two sources of income should be used for specific purposes, and the income and expenditure should be publicized, and no misappropriation is allowed. (4) When the temporary expenses of national schools are insufficient, the county government should launch a social donation to raise funds for the construction and equipment of national schools and to enrich books and instruments, based on the principle of voluntary donations from the people. (5) Each county should immediately determine special education funds in accordance with the law, and the original educational funds and properties should be earnestly consolidated, and the surplus should be included in the special fund. (6) Each locality should first increase funding for the existing number of national schools and enrich the content. After the financial resources are abundant, more schools and classes can be added. (7) After the implementation of these methods, all apportionments and various fees collected by schools in the past are uniformly prohibited.</p>

<h3>Secondary and Higher Education Schools in This City Request Exemption from Income Tax for Faculty and Staff</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The principals of secondary and higher education schools in this city held a symposium the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of income tax for faculty and staff. It was generally agreed that the salaries of faculty and staff are calculated according to the index method for public education personnel, with a base salary of 30 yuan, and the remainder is calculated in multiples of one-tenth. The remaining nine-tenths are equivalent to being donated to the government. The difficult living conditions of colleagues are also well-known facts, and they really cannot afford to pay income tax. Therefore, they requested the Municipal Education Bureau to forward the request to the Municipal Government to consult with the Bureau of Direct Taxes of the Ministry of Finance to exempt them.</p>

<h3>Hookworm Disease: An Enemy of the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Wang Wanbai</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from the Suzhou Huxuguan Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant, which stated in brief: "Our plant owns mulberry fields and employs mulberry workers who specialize in cultivation. Every year during the yellow plum season, the workers enter the mulberry fields barefoot. Within a few days, their insteps become slightly swollen and unbearably itchy. After a few days, internal diseases develop, with mild fever, itchy throat, and cough. Later, their complexion gradually turns sallow, their spirits become haggard, and their physical strength becomes unsustainable, eventually leading to their inability to work. This disease is commonly known as 'mulberry leaf yellow.' In the rural areas of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou, countless workers suffer from this disease every year. The impact on work is a minor matter, but the devastation to life is truly heartbreaking. Medical and pharmaceutical facilities in townships are very rudimentary, and treatment is naturally difficult to be effective. They want to seek medical treatment in the city, but they are unable to do so, forming a situation of helplessness and allowing it to take its natural course. I remember that in the past, you, Doctor, once gave a broadcast lecture, mentioning that when you were in charge of the church hospital in Changzhou, there were many similar diseases that were not difficult to cure. I have long admired your profound medical knowledge and rich experience, and you must have in-depth research on this disease. Therefore, I am writing to request a more detailed answer to the origin of this disease and its treatment and prevention. This is not only the happiness of our plant, but all those who have the same disease in various places will feel your boundless virtue."</p>
<p>According to this, the disease is actually hookworm disease, which is indeed an enemy of the countryside. It is extremely prevalent along the Yangtze River basin and the Beijing-Shanghai area. However, it is also found in many other places. Because it is quite important, in addition to broadcasting on the Gospel Radio, I have specially extracted a summary and published it in the newspaper to arouse the attention of health authorities and socially conscious people.</p>
<p>Pathogen The cause of this disease is the transmission of a tiny parasitic worm called hookworm. The adult worm is as thin as a thread, only a few millimeters long, and lives in the small intestine of the patient, in very large numbers, attached to the intestinal mucosa, sucking human blood. Therefore, the patient has severe anemia. The worm eggs are extremely small and can only be seen under a microscope magnified hundreds of times. The patient's feces contain as many as four or five trillion worm eggs each time, which is the source of transmission of this disease.</p>
<p>Transmission Hookworm eggs develop very quickly in the soil. After the larvae hatch, they can infect humans in four or five days. The route of transmission is through unclean food, which directly enters the mouth, but the number is still small. Most of the larvae in the soil invade the human body through the skin of the legs and feet, first entering the veins to the heart, then entering the lungs, and then following the trachea into the esophagus and down to the stomach and intestines, where they parasitize and suck blood. Therefore, after infection, there is first itching of the skin, followed by sore throat and fever, and finally extreme anemia. The toxins secreted by the worms also cause toxicity, leading to exhaustion and death.</p>
<p>Symptoms After becoming ill, the main symptoms are anemia, pale complexion, and fatigue. However, the appetite is still good, so it is also called the "eating but lazy yellow disease." Female patients gradually stop menstruating, then death is not far away. Children who suffer from this disease are physically weak, and their studies are naturally unable to cope with. Their temper is also bad, making them annoying. Morality, intelligence, and physical fitness all fail. Male and female farmers and workers who suffer from this disease can eat but cannot work, and are often ridiculed, suffering both physical and mental pain.</p>
<p>Treatment First, check the stool. If hookworm eggs are found, then deworming is necessary. Ordinary drugs for roundworms are ineffective. The well-known drug for treating this disease is Chenopodium oil. For the method of administration, one should first take a spoonful of Glauber's salt dissolved in four or five spoonfuls of water the night before going to bed. The next morning, abstain from food and take one capsule of Chenopodium oil containing five drops each at seven, eight, and nine o'clock, for a total of three capsules. After another two hours, take two or three spoonfuls of Glauber's salt dissolved in half a teacup of water. Then the worms will all be excreted. The shape of the worm can be slightly seen in the sunlight with the feces dissolved in water. One can only eat thin porridge at noon, and then eat normally afterwards. It is even better to take iron-containing blood tonics, or eat more pork liver, which can replenish blood. It is best to take the deworming medicine again after two weeks to eradicate the roots.</p>
<p>Prevention In areas where this disease is prevalent, feces should be disinfected with lime and stored in pits for a long time for composting to kill the eggs. Farm workers must wear shoes and socks to prevent skin contact with soil. After work and before eating, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly. Strict implementation will avoid infection. It is hoped that the responsible agencies will widely publicize this.</p>
<h3>How to Control Diphtheria</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>Besides smallpox, perhaps the greatest success of human research on immunization work is to conquer diphtheria, in other words, mankind can control the infection of vicious diphtheria. Recalling history, we must praise Loeffler for first discovering the diphtheria bacillus. Later, two experts, Roux and Yersin, made further research and proved that the symptoms of diphtheria are not due to the spread of bacteria throughout the body, but because the bacteria are selected in one place; it does not spread throughout the body, but the toxins it produces are absorbed into the blood circulation. In 1892, Von. Behring's research proved that horses have natural immunity to diphtheria; why can they have immunity? Because diphtheria bacilli are inoculated into the horse's body, the horse's blood quickly produces an antitoxin, which is found in horse serum; if horse serum is injected into the body of a diphtheria patient, it can have an effect of neutralizing the toxins produced by the bacteria. Because of Behring's new invention, the mortality rate of diphtheria has dropped from 50% to less than 10%. If we treat the patient early, or the amount of antitoxin is appropriate, then the mortality rate can be reduced to about 2%. Therefore, mankind can control diphtheria, and Behring's contribution to the history of immunization is truly indelible.</p>
<p>How can we control vicious diphtheria? The first step is to start with the use of antitoxin until the discovery of preventive serum in 1920, that is, the mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin began to be injected into elementary school students to maintain immunity in the body. The discovery of this work is as great as Jenner's invention of cowpox. Now I would like to introduce Schiek's great achievements in diphtheria immunity.</p>
<p>In 1908, Schiek injected a small amount of toxin into the skin, the dose being the minimum lethal dose of diphtheria toxin of a guinea pig weighing 250 grams (M.L.D1/50), diluted with 0.1-0.2 cubic liters of saline solution, and injected into the skin of the forearm. If a red halo appears at the injection site, it is positive, proving that our body lacks antitoxin and is easily infected with diphtheria. If it is a negative reaction, it means that our body contains more than one-thirtieth of a unit of antitoxin in each milliliter of blood, which can protect us from diphtheria infection under normal circumstances. The conclusion of Schiek's experiment is to distinguish between two categories, infectious and non-infectious. Preventive injections are given to those who are infectious, and they will have immunity after a certain period of time. After 1902, the method of preparing preventive serum was gradually improved, using denatured toxin Toxoid. In fact, the principle is still the same. Using this preventive method to reduce the severity of the disease has indeed achieved the effect of "getting twice the result with half the effort." According to statistics, in New York City alone, from 1890 to 1894, when diphtheria antitoxin was not yet widely used, 134 out of every 100,000 people died of diphtheria each year; from 1900 to 1904, diphtheria antitoxin had been widely adopted, and the mortality rate of diphtheria was reduced from 58 per 100,000 people. From 1915 to 1919, everyone had a position on diphtheria antitoxin and it was widely used. During these years, the mortality rate was only 21 per 100,000 people. From 1920 to 1934, the mortality rate was only 2.2, that is, only 22 people per million died of diphtheria each year. By 1935, only nine people per million died of diphtheria in New York City. In this year, not a single person died of diphtheria in 19 cities in the United States. The result of this fact proves that the principle of immunity is that diphtheria antitoxin can only protect us from diphtheria and has nothing to do with other infectious diseases. Later, Dr. Ehrlich proposed a side chain theory for immunity.</p>
<p>Immunity is because immune bodies are produced in human cells (Immunebodies may have several organs, such as the spleen, liver, thyroid, etc., which are particularly powerful and active in the manufacture of this immune body; but, to date we know that the human body does not have a special organ, or a group of cells, for making immune bodies. Dr. Ehrlich only imagined that infectious bacteria or toxins come into contact with human cells, and the revived cells are stimulated, and then make a certain chemical substance to neutralize this toxin, or kill these bacteria.

<h3>Statistics of X-ray Examination of 7,203 People</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Chinese people avoid medical treatment, which has become a common habit in society, especially for lung diseases. Looking at the X-ray examination statistics of 7,203 people in Hongcheng Sanatorium in the 36th year, it was found that more than 22% of them had tuberculosis. This phenomenon is truly regrettable! What is even more surprising is that a total of 569 people were found to have bilateral tuberculosis, accounting for nearly 8% of the total number of examinations. Most of these patients are usually unaware of it, and the symptoms are very mild; if they are not examined by X-ray, they will never know that both lungs are diseased. Therefore, X-ray diagnosis is said to be a compass for our life safety, which is not an exaggeration. This is the first. In addition, there are 195 people with heart and aortic dilation. If X-ray examination is not performed, it will not be possible to know that the most important organs of their body have undergone major pathological changes; just like sailing in the dark night, the danger is very great. If these people can be treated early, they will be able to recover their health soon. This is the second. The right lung is more likely to be diseased than the left lung. This is the third. In terms of age, young people aged 20 to 30 are often the biggest targets of tuberculosis; and especially at the age of 24, it is the most dangerous age for people to suffer from lung disease. This is the fourth. In terms of occupation, the unemployed and students are often the concentration points of tuberculosis. This is the fifth.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The success or failure of the prevention of tuberculosis has a great relationship with the general national health. If we think about it, almost every family and every unit, whether it is a store, a bank, or a school, must have one to several people who are affected by tuberculosis. Therefore, preventing tuberculosis is like fighting a fire, and we must not let it spread naturally; we must use effective methods to prevent it with all our strength. Especially in public places, such as schools and factories, we must implement group inspections to find out the unconscious tuberculosis one by one, which is the way to clarify the source. I remember that ten years ago, in the Federation of Universities, I tried my best to advocate that all new students entering university must undergo X-ray examination. According to the current social situation, it is a necessary measure. Last autumn, Jiaotong University admitted more than 300 new students, and after X-ray examination, it was found that seven of them had tuberculosis; once treated early, not only will their studies not be interrupted, but their personal health can be restored; and their families will invisibly reduce the occurrence of tragedies, and the society will reduce invisible infections. One move has several benefits. As for the future when they complete their studies and serve the country, it is even more of a matter. A hundred years of education, tuberculosis prevention and examination, is the preliminary foundation! (Detailed statistics are attached)</p>

<h3>Homeward Bound Eulogy</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>The title “Homeward Bound” comes from Zhang Baozhai’s “Wen Shi Tong Yi Homeward Bound” chapter:</p>
<p>“An honest person good at selling books, an old family rich in collecting books, an enthusiast brave enough to publish books, are all people of erudite renown who would link arms and enter the forest together… However, these people are nothing more than musical instrument makers and stone tablet craftsmen, their art having only a connection to literary refinement; having associated with many famous people, they are accustomed to hearing pure words and renowned theories, yet their chests are devoid of pearls of wisdom. Thus, their word-of-mouth hearsay and shallow knowledge of fundamentals are not difficult to discern. Scholar Zhou Changfa compared such people to being 'homeward bound,' a strange yet accurate statement… Scholars, limited in their experience and knowledge, upon encountering the arguments of the 'homeward bound,' are shocked as if by thunder splitting a mountain, leading to the mingling of fish eyes and pearls, unable to distinguish between the pure and impure. These people also appoint themselves to be so, unaware that their 'bound' originates from 'homeward'…”</p>
<p>This statement is correct, but inevitably somewhat harsh. People of the Qing dynasty valued narrow and deep research. As stated in the "Han Shu Yi Wen Zhi," Dongfa received instruction, but could not exhaust the classics even with white hair, which might be true. Chen Shuofu spent forty years of painstaking effort on a single book, "Shou Shi Zhuan Shu," first drafting lengthy notes, then completing a monograph. We must truly admire him, but having devoted so much time, he merely found evidence that was neither close nor far, with forced connections, to find procedures that showcased his ability to make forced connections. This time was also spent quite pitifully.</p>
<p>Naturally, our era has changed, our perspectives have broadened, and our views are fundamentally different from those of the ancients. However, the writings of Ma Ruichen and others at that time were indeed superior to Chen's book. Therefore, we cannot blindly worship false treasures built of hard work, which is quite obvious. However, what I want to discuss is not simply a matter of time, but that today's social environment simply does not allow us the time or possibility for such work. Even if there were such weighty works, few people would be able to digest them! It was often said that scholars of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods were influenced by literary inquisitions, forcing them to delve into minutiae. As a result, in the field of classical studies, there were the magnificent "Huang Qing Jing Jie Zheng Xu Bian" with thousands of volumes, and historical studies were even more abundant. However, in my view, we must still adhere to materialism. The main reason was the abundance of material resources and the simplicity of life at that time, especially in the rice-producing regions of Jiangnan, where everyone lived a life of extreme comfort and stability. Learning originally arises from stability, especially classical research. It is like wealthy families building houses, painting beams and carving pillars, exhausting the abilities of decoration. If people are exposed to the elements, they can only build a few thatched huts to avoid wind and rain. The ancients said that the hungry easily become food seekers, and the cold easily wear short clothes, which is the same principle. What was the scene during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras? How can it be compared to today's rice prices, commodity prices, and livelihood situations? I read Wang Longzhuang's posthumous works, which recorded the flooding during the Kangxi era, where rice prices were only a few hundred coins per dou, and he already cried out loudly, believing the world could not be peaceful! If they were born today, who knows what they would think! Chen Shuofu, Duan Mao Ying, Wang Huaizu, and other masters, if they were university professors today, would probably only be able to appeal with no results, weeping in a cow shed. "Shuo Wen Jie Zi Zhu" and "Jing Chuan Shi Ci" would probably never be completed.</p>
<p>According to this, being "homeward bound" today is not so bad. Taking booksellers as an example, at that time, they could still connect with refined scholars, spread rumors and gossip. Although they lacked pearls of wisdom, their tastes were not low. What about now? Beijing is a concentration of old bookstores, but aren't they all being bundled and sold as waste paper by the catty? Even if the government has allocated as much as a billion dollars to rescue these "materials," it is a drop in the bucket, with little effect. Moreover, I have personally seen many old painting shops converted to selling new books exclusively. The so-called new books are really only limited to Feng XX's love novels and XX Louzhu's chivalrous tales. How can one seek to be "homeward bound" in this way? Look at the book dealers, and then look at the educators in schools, how many can truly lead the masses with knowledge, like Peking University during the May Fourth Movement, or the Wumu Caotang and Shiwu Xuetang during the Hundred Days' Reform? Those with true ability either become high officials, start businesses, or simply go to Columbia, California, Harvard, and other universities across the Pacific to earn American dollars. Those who remain are struggling in hunger and cold. Under the heavy pressure of life, it is already extremely difficult to seek even a little “homeward bound,” let alone specialize?</p>
<p>There is another layer of meaning here, which is purely theoretical. Learning is broad before it is profound, which is what we call pyramid achievements. In other words, any specialization must be built on common sense. Common sense is not specialization, but the knowledge that ordinary people must have. This can also be called "homeward bound," or named the "ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign school." I feel that studying today, continuing to adhere to the "family laws" and "master laws" of the Han Confucians is definitely foolish and reckless. A bit of scientific method and scientific knowledge is essential for everyone, otherwise, they will become blind and foolish. (Wang Chong, "Lun Heng": "Knowing the present but not the past is called submersion; knowing the past but not the present is called blindness.") Even if you are a specialist in Han and Song classics, what use is it? The era of learning for the sake of learning has already passed. Although not necessarily learning leads to high rank, how can we ignore its current use? Therefore, "homeward bound" itself is undesirable, but as the foundation of specialized academic studies, we are afraid of losing it. Some people advocate that those who study literature and history do not need to know physics and chemistry, perhaps because they do not fully understand the importance of common sense. If this idea is understood, then the Chinese academic community can enter a new era.</p>
<h3>On Movies</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I watched a movie, and friends who like to meddle often inquire: “Why don’t you watch movies anymore?” Their tone is full of surprise, as if they saw me fasting.</p>
<p>The reason I haven't watched movies for a long time is actually just because—I have no money or I don’t understand English. But I’m not willing to say it directly, and instead search for grand and dignified reasons. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” Finally, I found a reason that is enough to write a paper about—and there are two of them.</p>
<p>First, people who have watched movies for a few years or hundreds of times are sorry to say that their stupidity is unsurpassed. Movies are said to be good in America, but I have a clipping from the Washington Post from ten years ago in my drawer, which is about Hollywood. It says: “We still have to praise Hollywood for some of its merits. No matter how many times a story is used, a film always has a different name.”</p>
<p>Second, my children over ten years old like to watch movies more than they like to read books. They are unhappy if they don’t watch a movie for a week, and they are still unhappy on Tuesdays because they can’t continue watching after watching one on Sunday. I think this child is unpromising, so I went to places with schools to inquire, with hidden worries. Hmm, it turns out that many young friends with schoolbags aged fourteen or fifteen are talking about movies and movie stars, such as "So and so, have you seen that so and so movie? It's really 'zan'!" "How could I not watch it? That protagonist is really 'ling'!" Later, on the streetcar, because I was paying attention, I often heard young men and women talking about movies.</p>
<p>So I paid attention to the movie advertisements in the newspaper and classified them roughly into three categories: "Female Knight Golden Silk Tiger," "Devil Knight's Bloody Record," "Little White Dragon," "King Kong," "Spy Web," "Destroy the Terrorist Bomb," "Murderer," "Haunted House," "Precious Sword Divine Whip," "Lightning Bandit," "Divine Whip Knight," etc., belong to the category of gods and monsters and martial arts; "Smuggling Beauty," "Hairpin Light Sword Shadow," "Marriage Oath," "Operation Beauty," "Mermaid," etc., belong to the category of fragrant, sensual, romantic love; the third category is literary ethics, but unfortunately, they are rare, and I can't remember a few names, so I'll omit them.</p>
<p>I don’t know which category young men and women like to watch the most, and I don’t know what the result will be if young men and women watch too many of these movies. I just don’t watch them myself, and I prepare more comic books for my children to watch instead of movies. First, to save money, and second, to weigh the advantages and disadvantages. In my humble opinion, the former is perhaps better than the latter.</p>

<p>Because of my wife's critical illness, I deeply feel the importance of a public medical system; a society that cannot guarantee a high standard of living for everyone cannot be considered how unreasonable, and a society that cannot guarantee full employment for everyone cannot fully prove how backward it is; even not being able to provide adequate medical care for the majority of people is the most tragic thing. Science has not yet progressed to the omnipotent point of "no disease cannot be cured," but after all, it is doing its best to relieve the dangers and sufferings of human pathology. If this possibility is blocked by human causes, putting patients beyond the difficulties that can be overcome, and rejecting them beyond the conditions that can be solved, then it should be the most cruel example. No wonder progressive medical scholars are loudly calling for the establishment of a public medical system. Any medical and pharmaceutical institutions that boast of "charity" and service are reaching out to ask for money, money, money from patients with or without money. People with money are blessed—it is "harder than a camel passing through the eye of a needle" for people without money to enter the hospital. This is the reality, this is the cruel reality!</p>
<p>It is said that the UK has already implemented a public system. The UK's national policy is absolutely incompatible with the Soviet Union's policy of bloody revolution, which shows that a public medical system does not necessarily originate from any communist heresy. We yearn for the day when the real Three People's Principles will be realized, at least patients will not be shut out of the square-shaped hospital gates—but when will the Three People's Principles be realized? Thinking about it makes me feel hopeless!</p>
<h3>Hoffman, the Man</h3>
<p>— Dao Xian</p>
<p>Paul Hoffman, the executor of the US foreign aid bill, started his career by selling cars. He dropped out of the University of Chicago after studying for a year and went to sell cars. Selling goods is his forte. He showed his skills in the Los Angeles car market. During World War I, he served as an artilleryman for two years, then returned to Los Angeles and opened a Studebaker dealership.</p>
<p>In 1925, he was appointed Vice President of Studebaker, responsible for sales. In 1933, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Hoffman helped to reorganize it. In 1935, he took over as President and has remained so until now.</p>
<p>Hoffman does not smoke and is completely abstinent from alcohol. He is a practical person. He believes that enlightened capitalism is the world's most productive economic system.</p>
<h3>Book Detective</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>One cold morning in 1931, a pedestrian stopped in front of an old bookstore on the east side of New York. He casually picked through a pile of water-stained old books and selected one.</p>
<p>"How much?" he asked the shop owner.</p>
<p>"Five cents a book."</p>
<p>A deal was done. The pedestrian was Lew David Feldam, a cunning bookseller from Fifth Avenue. The book he bought for five cents was one of the rarest of the rare - the first and last collection of poems by the great poet Edgar Allan Poe, "Tamerlane and Other Poems". Feldam sold this collection for a good price of $25,000. The old shop owner was so angry when he found out that he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Feldam is an expert in searching for rare and precious books. He has been engaged in this work for nearly 20 years and is known as the number one book detective in the United States. This blue-eyed "bookworm" eats books, sleeps books, and dreams of books. His amazing ability to detect books makes his business extremely prosperous. Collectors, museums, libraries, schools, industrial institutions, advertising agencies, and even zoos entrust him to buy books.</p>
<p>The client's entrustment often leads Feldam to discover interesting historical reversals. For example, most Americans firmly believe that their Founding Father George Washington was a gentle and courteous person. However, some American historians believe that their first president was a violent, rude, and impolite person. An expert in ancient American history entrusted Feldam to collect as many documents written by Washington himself as possible. After digging through book markets in various places for several months, he finally found something written by Washington, titled: "Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behavior In Company and Conversation," which is enough to prove that Washington was a polite and courteous gentleman.</p>
<p>Feldam was originally an importer of Far Eastern jewelry. In order to find a bookseller who could increase his knowledge of jewelry, he failed, so he personally got into the pile of books, and as a result, he discovered many things that ordinary jewelers did not know, so he decided to change careers and become today's "Sherlock Holmes of the book industry."</p>
<h3>On Marriage Education</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai University's plan to set up a course on marriage has been well received by all sectors of society. Articles discussing it have also appeared frequently in "Free Talk". However, it seems that there are still some people in society who hold a reserved attitude, even professors at Shanghai University are no exception.</p>
<p>In fact, the University of North Carolina in the United States set up courses on various aspects of marriage, both psychological and physiological, twenty years ago (1927). Although it was quite obstructed at the time, it achieved remarkable results, and those who opposed it could only remain silent. Recently, nearly 600 universities in the United States have courses on marriage.</p>
<h3>Memories</h3>
<p>— Ping Yuan</p>
<p>My heart was originally calm, without waves, without raging tides. But "it" flew to hover around me, gently knocking on my heart, and singing the old songs that I had almost forgotten into my ear again and again... I couldn't refuse, so I had to allow "it" to slip into my heart "just once".</p>
<p>But this just once, decided the future troubles. It kept pouring out the sorrows and hatreds of the past, those that I had spent great effort to forget, and maintained the balance of my psychology, but, it sent these to my ears in a sad tone, and depicted a group of faces familiar to me to gnaw at my heart. From then on, I lost my peace.</p>
<p>It is it, which makes me think hard in the long nights, stare blankly in the clear days, lose my lively mood, forget the world in front of me, corrode myself—ignore the most real present, only know the past rendered extremely beautiful by my prejudiced brain...</p>
<p>"Memories"! This beautiful and autocratic demon king - I can't resist you, I am willing to be teased by you, but, I also know that the "past" is also accumulated from "reality", let those beautiful factors that can encourage me live in my heart; let those entanglements that make me sad stay away from me!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Zeng Mengpu (Supplement)</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>I published anecdotes about Mr. Zeng in the newspapers, and I have also seen many reports in Shanghai newspapers about his trivial matters, so I will supplement what was not prepared.</p>
<p>In his later years, Mr. Zeng lived in seclusion in the Xu Chou Garden (commonly known as Zeng Garden, in Jiuwanwei, Changshu), where he widely planted flowers and trees, including foreign varieties from the West, with thousands of purples and reds, as if entering a country of a hundred flowers. In summer, when lotus flowers are in full bloom, tea seats are set up all over the pool, and visitors are always full. Mr. Zeng wears a hat and holds a cane, walking and chanting in between; he expresses his feelings and forgets all honors and humiliations. Every night, he pours new Fudan tea into the calyx of the lotus flower, and cooks it the next morning to enjoy with guests, its fragrance is fragrant, elegant and also rhyme.</p>
<p>After Mr. Zeng passed away, Jin Songcen said that "Nie Hai Hua" was first created by him, and then continued by Mr. Zeng, so he wrote a poem for Mr. Zeng, which said: "The fate of incense is deep, but the friendship is shallow, this feeling only the night stars know." He also said: "It took a lot of words before Lu and after Wang." This is to be especially passed down by future generations of literary circles, so there is no need to rush to determine it.</p>
<p>After Mr. Zeng won the Juren degree in the Qing Guangxu period, he went to Beijing to take the imperial examination. According to legend, he failed because the ink on his examination paper was spilled. Mr. Zeng himself said that it was because he was sad after losing his wife, so he could not finish the exam; there was no spilling of ink on the examination paper. However, it was rumored in the village that Mr. Zeng had obtained the three words "Yuan Mi Shi" (元秘史) from Shaanxi Province, so he told his close friend, and was overheard by one person. Mr. Zeng and his close friend both failed, and the person who overheard it uniquely succeeded. This person still exists today, so I don't want to write his surname. If the rumor is true, how can we ask Elder Yangu (the author who continued "Nie Hai Hua") in the ninth heaven to prove his statement? However, Mr. Zeng has always been indifferent to fame and fortune, and has been a famous son and virtuous official all his life; in the end, he was clean and poor, burdened with debts, and immortal with literature, worthy of being a first-class writer. Lin Qinnan and Hu Shi, whose literary views are completely different, praised "Nie Hai Hua" in unison, without any different words.</p>
<h3>Song of the King of Trees</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Mount Xidam is the sea of ten thousand firs, where lush green clouds gather, and the sun dares not turn red. The branches and trunks are all hundreds or thousands of years old. The most ancient one is called the King of Trees, located below the Immortal Peak, next to the Old Hall of the Mountain Opening. It is large enough to be embraced seven times, comparable to the sacred tree of Alishan in Taiwan. Mr. Yu Youren inscribed a stone to protect the roots, and the ink is dripping and pleasing! When I was living in western Zhejiang, I was actually relying on the foot of the mountain, but I never climbed it for two years, because the path was dangerous and very far. In the winter of Guiwei, I was about to go to Tiantai. Mr. Yang Ling told me that the soldiers had not stopped fighting, and when would I come again? You must have a poem to record the great tree. The next day, I went with my brother Lin Ze, his wife Shi Zhongxing, and a monk, and returned after passing through the clouds and smoke and stroking it, and got several rhymes of seven-character verses. Even now, when I think about the people and events here, the sadness is hard to describe!</p>
<p>The "Shui Jing Zhu" records the Tianmu firs, with countless five-embraces and ten-drags. The green surges into tides for thousands of years, and the clouds do not rain and the wind does not rage. There is also the King of Trees that soars into the sky, with the lower section of the earth held by a dragon as a borer. One branch returns to the southeast with spring, and one leaf falls with frost on the country. The leaves fall and the immortals and mortals grow old one after another. Stroking it, I lament that there is no solid bark. Why ask Nuwa for refining stones? Prince Shen Seng only has tombstones! The traces of the prehistoric times are difficult to check. This mountain has this tree. I was born after ten thousand eons, and when I read it, I understand the admiration of the generals. When I was young, I casually took on the integrity of Pan and Cuo, and when I was strong, I painfully relied on Fuyu! It's not that my hometown's willows are not good, but the Weng Zhong's have sent Cai Jing to his doom. The Kuncai replaces the weapon with the fighting Hu children, and the He boat carries Sichuan to the road of life and death. Coming from the west, I lament the birds and insects, and turning to look at the mountain, I dare not write a poem. The swaying and melancholy resembles Geng Xin's sadness, and the great material is worried like Du Fu? The dim Ruo lamp is two weeks a year, and the wood spirit and poetry spirit are separated by sleep. No wonder the thunder urges by the wine bottle, and the purple dragon often carries the dream away. The fugitive's ink stains Jiangyou, and the withered vine is lazy to stay at the Immortal Peak. Should I know what age the world is now, and why not spit my lungs to Mei Ya? Sincerity and emotion can be the same, and the tree can speak and share the old man's words! I heard it, and I bowed again and tears flowed. At the fifth watch, I wrapped up the green vines. The black winter is bleak, and the crows are tired and crying, with a few residual stars breaking the dawn. The Shahan guest carries the red sleeves to follow, and the poetry official and the thin monk laboriously lead the way. One peak and two peaks pass under the feet, and one journey and two journeys rely on the void. The discussion wheel rises up quickly, chasing after the cave, and looks up to see the yin mist. The higher the steps, the smoother and harder they are. The sharp rise suddenly leads to the fall, abandoning the cane, pulling the cold, and entrusting the climbing, and the previous life has been trained to achieve the tools to overcome the victory. Before anything, the Tianmen opens, and the sea of trees is clear and icy. The sun shines on the head, and the jade dust flies, and the clustered branches of Wu Mian have not been hit by catkins. How can we make a limited magical work, and fly and carry three troops for a moment? There is more ironing of the mourning goose tears, and don't let the reed flowers cry in the wind and dew! The absurd wishes are held before the ancient times, and the lowly travels to the gods towards the wandering. Absolutely laugh at the special etiquette, and the green cover comes out of the high place to meet the cliff. It stands like a copper pillar in the barbarian corner, and the fire is not allowed to look at the Ezo. It is as bright as a brocade-clad hard crossbow, and shoots down the arrogant with a sword. The arms that take the clouds are divided into two hemispheres, and the purple condensation is fragrant and the pendants are jingling. The horizontal and vertical strips are full of patterns, and the solemn atmosphere is like a arsenal. The unicorn sings and the phoenix blows and flies, and the ghosts and monsters are terrifying. The vast giant vein runs through the Qinggang, and is it not the essence of the sun and moon? Holding the shadow to mourn the soul of the ant, the old man is about to meet the old man! The tree is also accumulated for generations and has forgotten words, silently showing the whole history of rise and fall: The east branch hates to send Xu Fu's boat, and the north branch has seen Meng Tian's garrison. The various countries in the west sea have mixed grievances and graces, and the south clothing is now attached. Since ancient times, the country has been protected by loyal hearts, and the mountains and rivers must be protected by swords and soldiers! Guide me to look at Bayu, and lie down for seven years and eat courage; Looking back, I lost my joy at the island city, and the barbarians returned with white hair and the morale was low. The hatred of the ages will be repaid in my body, and the tree will cut you open and cross the sea! Sing barefoot on the summit of Mount Fuji, and the shrine is drunk and messy. Kill the familiar and execute the especially righteous punishment, and watch the falling city and cut off its fate. At this time, my intention wants to be infatuated, and at this time, the monk official sighs many times. Although it is useless from morning to dusk, I finally pity the infatuation of praying to heaven with evidence! The temple and the wild are discussed by future generations, and Yu Ran's ink applies the beard's sentence.</p>
