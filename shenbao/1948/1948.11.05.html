<h3>國防部發表一週戰局　錦西國軍大戰果　犯太原匪傷逾八萬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕國防部政工局四日發表十月廿八日至十一月三日之「一週戰局」稱：本週內各戰塲，除東北華北外，其他華中方面，則比較沉寂。除了國軍在蘇北和募中豫東繼續掃蕩打家刧舍的零股共匪外，所有津浦平漢隴海各綫，亦均無大戰關，茲將東北華北戰局分述於後：</p>
<p>（一）東北戰塲</p>
<p>週內東北戰塲，變化相當的大，國軍爲統籌全局爭取最後勝利，故對局部已失戰略意義的點綫，不再留駐大軍。</p>
<p>東北國軍爲保持國家的領土主權，三年以來已盡最大的責任，自長春，錦州陷匪後，匪又以二·三·四·五·七·八·十等縱隊，與我軍在黑山·新立屯·半拉門·新民等地區，竭力阻止國軍西進，另以一·六·十二·等縱隊及三·四·六·九·十等獨立師及韓共李紅光所部，向我潘陽週邊竄犯，西起新民，北起鐵嶺，東至撫順本溪，南達海城，均在戰鬭中。自十月卅日起，迄十一月一日止，戰事接近東大營·北陵機塲及高力屯。東陵等地，我軍在匪的四面進攻竄擾中，應予匪以重創，戰事持續至二日拂曉，藩陽對外聯絡始吿中斷。據空軍偵察報吿，我軍已照預定計劃，分路移轉。遼西方面，新民以東迄巨流河遼中一帶，一週來均不斷在接觸中，匪在該方面未敢以主力向我進犯，故我軍均能按預定部署，向指定地區安全轉進·錦西方面，高橋以北匪第四·第十一縱隊，正被我軍痛擊，大與堡以西之江家屯復爲我攻克，匪第九縱隊負創向北敗逃，同時踞興城之匪獨四師被我擊潰，該城已爲我收復，目前錦西國軍的活蹋行動，已使匪不敢正視該地。</p>
<p>（二）華北戰塲</p>
<p>太原攻防戰週內愈益激烈，匪新四旅及忻等支隊，第八，第七，第十五等三個縱隊，附砲五十餘門，自廿九日下午起，傾全力再度向我城東淖馬村，小窰頭，及牛頭村以南高地，瘋狂猛撲，我軍分路迎擊，並集中各種火力，制壓犯匪，戰事之烈，爲太原保衛戰開始以來所僅見。迄三十日拂曉，匪以傷亡慘重，攻勢頓挫。卅一日及十一月二日下午，匪又向我城東淖馬村·小窰頭·牛駝寨及城北黃寨鎭等地兩度發動攻勢，除黃寨國軍轉移至附近核心陣地，繼續與匪激戰外，餘均被我擊退。總計一個月來（自十月一日至卅一日止），犯太原的匪，已斃傷達八萬三千八百多名，俘匪三千零四十一名，而我軍傷亡則僅一萬五千三百餘員名，兩相比較，足見犧牲在匪軍「人海戰術」下的無辜生命，是如何的衆多，我雖失去外團若干據點，但所獲代價是有意義的。</p>
<p>流竄在歸緩外圍的聶榮臻匪二·三·四·八·縱隊各一部，及姚喆等匪部，週來潛伏山區，未敢作大規模蠢動，惟近日踞薩縣，包頭之匪，己結集於歸綏之西，距城十五里地區已有散匪活動。</p>
<p>最近在平緩綫懷來以北，龍關以南地區的匪新八師，企圖偷襲懷來，不意反被國軍圍剿於龍關以南的上下豆子營一帶，警半日圍殲，計己斃傷匪二千餘，生俘匪一千四百七十三名，獲步槍七百六十四支，輕重機槍三十四艇，各種砲六門，及其他軍用品甚多，刻猶在擴大戰果中·我沿平保綫南下國軍，曾速克方順橋，望都，淸風店等地，匪第七縱隊負創向平漢路兩側潰竄，國軍此種機動的戰略行動，使匪的第三縱隊和第四縱隊各部主力已由察南被我誘致到冀中，易縣滿城來了，該方面可能會有如理想的戰果·</p>

<h3>賀杜魯門當選連任</h3>
<p>並願吾人學習美國之民主自由的精神</p>
<p>美國總統選舉已於三日午夜揭曉，杜魯門總統在廿六州中佔先，獲得選舉人票三〇四票當選連任，而一般預測可望獲勝的杜威竟吿落選。消　傳出，世人大都驚詫，視爲美國政治上的奇蹟。其實，社魯門總統的當選連任，並不值得　異，不但不能算得是美國政治上的奇蹟，而且正足以表示美國民主政治之眞正精神。</p>
<p>我們且將杜魯門獲勝的原因暫置不論，世人預料杜威競選總統獲勝有十拿九穩的把握，都是受了美國的廣播和報紙作種種預測的暗示所致，殊不知美國的廣播和報紙，未必卽能眞正代表民意，尤其在競選高潮中，廣播和報紙者被人們看做宣傳，就是它想控制民意，也控制不了美國人民的自由意志。惟其美國公民知識程度甚高，對政府政策判別各有其主見，決非人云亦云的盲從軍衆，而且選舉制度又眞能秘密而自由，任何人不能用絲毫强制脅迫的方法去影響他人的投票，故杜魯門總統之獲選連任，正是美國一般人民所享民主自由之崇高表現，值得吾人仰慕和學習。誠如我國駐美大使顧維鈞所說：「美國人民對於選擇統治國家之公僕，有完全絕對的自由·」的確，這次大選的結果，實爲美國政治眞正民主的一個有力明證。</p>
<p>這事在第三者看來非常明白，就是：美國選民擁護杜魯門總統，使其得以當選連任，恐怕因爲杜魯門之富於奮鬥精神。杜魯門總統三年以來的政績如何見仁見智，容有不同，然而目前世界局勢的危急，千鈞一髮，瞬息萬變，客觀的形勢不　許美國政府更迭，更不容許美國政治上有兩個多月的「眞空」時期，而授侵略極權主義者以間隙。誰都知道，近年來美國人民對於世界大事，不僅消息靈通，而且洞若觀火，人人都瞭解「杜魯門主義」的眞諦，個個都懂得「馬歇爾計劃」的作用，而面對美國在「冷戰」中步步忍讓的事實，自不允許杜魯門政府在暴力之前再行退却，而要杜魯門總統繼續努力，以貫澈其初衷。杜魯門總統在這次競選中，一開始外間就散這了杜威可以獲勝的空氣，此種氣氛且與日俱增，而杜魯門總統却我行我素，依然積極奮鬥，直至最後投票的一天，而絲毫無懈怠氣餒之威。這種奮鬥精神，就是美國目前在處理對內對外的大問題中所需要的精神。美國公民之所以選舉杜魯門者未必不由於此。因爲　美國民主共和兩個政黨的政綱政策，在本質上是沒有什麽多大出入的，尤其是杜魯門政府所推行的外交政策，更是兩黨一致的政策，馬歇爾國務卿出席任何國際會議，　和共和黨的要人范登堡杜勒斯等一同與會，遇到任何重大的國際問題，在决定方針之前，亦必與共和黨要人商得共同一致的協議。可見美國選民這次選擇不一定是政策上的選擇，而是應付大局誰更適宜的選擇。他們以爲美國爲應付目前危急萬狀的世界局勢計，與其將重責交給一位新人去冒險嘗試，母寗仍由現政府駕輕就熟去處理，何况杜魯門的連任還可以塡補了二個多月的政治「奠空」。</p>
<p>至於從美國內政的角度去觀察，杜威的失敗，或係受美國第八十屆國會所賜。何以言之？在大戰結束之後，一般人民對於民主黨的長期執政，似感厭倦，對於杜魯門政府的政績，也不無若干失望之處，所以在國會議員改選之時，大多數人傾向了共和黨，而此第八十屆國會乃在共和黨的控制之王·可惜第八十屆國會所通過的法案及其所作的活動，在內政方面，不免與人民的願望相背，尤其是剝奪工人罷工權利的哈特萊法案，爲一般平民所厭棄，誠如美國勞工聯合會主席格林伍所說：「美國人民已淸淸楚楚表示厭棄第八十屆國會之反動精神，民主黨必須發動「進步行動」，取消反動的勞工法案。」由此可知，第八十屆國會無形中造成一種不良的印象，使多數選民又由傾向共和　而移轉於民主黨。但無論如何，民主黨行將走下坡路的時候，由於杜魯門總統的領導而復振聲光，雖爲共和黨對內政策若干點所促成，杜魯門總統畢竟可以自豪了。</p>
<p>總之，今日美國選民的願望，對世界言，希望政府能沉着應付「冷戰」的攻勢，挽回世界的逆流，締造永久性的和平：對美國言，則希望政府繼續推行「新政」，力求經濟的合理化，以消除眼前的經濟恐慌的黑影，保持國內的安定與繁榮。這次杜魯門總統從險惡中獲得勝利，自能格外體認得出人民的願望，對於世界的和平與美國的繁榮，必將以全力爭取，庶不負千萬選民熱烈擁護的期望。</p>
<h3>焚燬沙面英領館嫌犯　穗特刑庭昨開審　檢察官及辯護律師均請予寬宥</h3>
<p>〔中央社廣州四日電〕廣州高等特種刑庭，四日至六日首次公審被控焚毀沙面英領館嫌疑犯十九人。四日上午九時半開庭，庭長符世蘭任審判長，檢察官謝頌雅先起立，陳述起訴理由，謂各被吿犯罪證據，經偵訊確鑿，惟各犯皆屬年少氣盛，犯罪動機或係激於一時義憤，無意獲咎，請審判長體念此點，酌减刑罰。繼以時間關係，先提審駱剛（大光報排字工友），司徒光（聖心中學學生），劉蘇（小販），馮肇　（南武中學學生），梁堅（小販）五人，彼等供稱係今年一月十六日下午一時半英領館被焚後二三小時，始因看熱閙在沙面或六二二路西橋頭，誤被憲警指爲疑犯逮捕者。被吿之辯護律師沈振中，陳玉衡等五人，先後起立，辯稱被吿所陳皆有事實可證，自不能僅聽一二憲警指控，且朱經傳訊有關證人，卽遽斷有罪，又各人籍貫，住所，職業皆不同，起訴書中更不能指爲同謀共犯，抑本案之發生，乃九龍城我國民居被港府拆毀事件之後果，當時我兩廣外交特派員曾聲明，如因此引起不幸之反應，港府應負其責，嗣卽因粤穗九龍事件後援會發動民衆遊行而釀成本案，足見縱屬犯罪，亦非被吿個人問題，何况各被吿旣非共產黨負，又罪證不足，應請宣判無罪。下午二時半續審鄧錦恒，梁昌銘，鄭飛雄，陳億浦，包漢卓，李顯泰六人，餘則分於五日六日偵訊。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨主席張君勱三日由蓉飛返本市，四日接見記者，縱談西南旅行觀感，謂西南各省情形，遠較此間爲安定，而此行最深刻之印像，卽爲各地均切望改革，否則現局難於維持，國民黨自身內部，亦苦悶思變。以政治改革而言，最重要者爲修正過度中央集權之制度，使地方能做事，此項原則對於軍事及黨務，亦同樣週用。現局之不樂觀，爲盡人皆知之事實，總統北巡歸來，所知當尤爲透澈。以美援而論，必需在自助之基礎上，方能有效爭取，絕對不能存依賴心理·今後美國之對華政策，將有所修正，惟其究屬趨於積極或消極，胥視國人之是否振作以爲斷。風人之理解，認爲美國對華之援助，不致超出軍火物資接濟之範圍，軍事援助不會做倒派還志願軍。如我國局勢繼續惡化，美國勢必自華北及青島徹退，對華中華南之行動，亦爲有限度的，因其決不肯與中共發生直接衝突也。無論民主黨或共和黨上台，所奉行者均爲兩黨外交政策，本質上並無歧異，蓋非此不足以應付世界之困難局面·預料杜魯門連任後，卽將與蘇聯進行談判，惟東西僵局之能否打開，將視折衝者之技巧而定，兩國之基本利益固有衝突之處，但尚不致於訴之戰爭。雙方之戰爭宣傳均甚猛烈，但實際上爲另一回事。</p>
<p>張氏本有昆明之行，但局勢緊急，故提早返滬，現正根據黨內之報吿，研究目前局勢，渠表示短期內不擬赴京。</p>

<h3>杜魯門將進行改組政府　加速輸出援外軍火　中國局勢亦在考慮之列　馬歇爾與福萊斯特等明年可能退休</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕由於杜魯門之當選，美國重整歐洲軍備之計劃將予擴大，同時反對美國援外計劃（包括經濟復興的或軍事的）之參議員七人及衆議員十二人，業已落選，故一般預料：行政當局現在將加速完成與西歐之軍事防禦同盟計劃，並加速運出貸與非共產國家之軍火。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社米蘇里州獨立城四日電〕杜魯門總統二日夜在其故鄉發表廣播稱：渠當選後，渠本人深明對世界和平福利之責任重大，此次選舉並非渠個人之勝利，而係民主黨及人民之勝利。杜魯門向國人提供諾言，決實現選舉運動中民主黨所宣佈之政綱，並要求國人對此種任務予以協助。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕杜魯門總統當選連任後之外交政策當着重於一大問題，卽美國願以並能以更多之金錢物資投入對蘇聯之冷戰中至何程度。據外交當局稱，杜氏對此問題如何答復，大致當視其在第二屆任期中全部防共計劃之範圍及效力如何而定。此種問題之發生則與世界三大危險區域有關，一卽西歐欲與美國訂立軍事同盟及租借軍火·據軍事專家估計，其費用每年當在二十億元以上。其二在中國，隨着國民政府遭受共黨軍事勝利之壓迫，美國正遭遇迫切之危機。其三在希臘，美國軍事援助雖使共黨游擊隊無法控制全國，但亦未能加以撲滅，美國會下屆會義或當討論更大之軍事援助計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕杜魯門總統四日自其故鄉還返白宮，準備繼續羅斯福之傳統政治·杜魯門之新政府，勢將推行新政，提高稅收及自由支配費用，政治路綫將針對中產階級。總統將於五日返抵華府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕被視爲大勢已去之杜魯門，今日居然在美國總統選舉中當選連任，眞是美國政治史上一大冷門。新政府將以新面目出現。國務部長馬歇爾平萌退志，據聞準備在明年二月辭職。國防部長福萊斯特或者也將退休。前國務次長艾契森有繼馬氏出長國務部的傳說，共和黨領袖也將換人無疑。十年來兩次競選統失敗的杜威聲明不願再試，暗示或將退出政治舞台。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕外交界方面認爲杜魯門可能委任美國最高法院院長文生爲新國務卿，以繼馬歇爾。據悉在外交政策方面杜魯門與文生之意見較爲接近。</p>

<h3>楊綽庵分析　六大都市配糧情形　上月短少之數　廿日左右撥足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕糧食緊急購儲會主委楊綽庵氏，昨日對記者分析六大都市之配米供應情形，略謂：十月份上海配米，共需五十五萬擔，已到者四十三萬五千擔，尚差十一萬五千擔，除去公敎職工配米七千擔，可以代金撥出外，事實上只差十萬零八千擔，預計本月二十日左右可全數抵達。南京方面，十月份共需十三萬擔，已到者十一萬五千擔，尚短少一萬五千擔，二十左右亦可解決。廣州方面因宋主席之努力，已由地方悉數籌足。平津十月份需麵粉一百三十萬袋，亦已全部籌足，內一百萬袋並已運到，尚短少三十萬袋，其中半數正候輪輸送，其餘之十五萬袋粉廠可於月半前交貨·靑島十月份之配糧無問題。至於配米之價格，十月份不致變動，十一月份則屬難言，因配米價格遠低於市價，全仗政府補貼，國庫固不勝負擔，而配給之目的，在保證人民獲得物資之供給，並非救濟性質，故有人主張提高配米價格，但在另一方面，亦有人主張配價維持不變，因恐由於米價之提高，而致影響整個物價。雙方均有見地，將來尚待會商決定。楊主委認爲政府控制區內，糧食尚堪自足，惟農民因米糧賣出後，所得不足以購進生活必需品，故拒不出賣，實爲當前最大之問題。限價取消後，採購工作較前順利，但因米價劇漲，過去所預定之經費，已有不敷運用之感。目前糧購會之採購區城，以蘇·浙·皖·贛四省爲限。楊主委最後表示，過去之糧源複雜，中信局，美援會，中華救濟團，經合分署，均有食糧供應，售出之米款均繳存央行，並未劃淸，恐日久混淆，故已決定成立糧源糧款淸理委員會，開始加以淸理。</p>

<h3>產區貨少不易採購　米市塲到貨不旺　白粳薄稻杜秈高貨均做百元</h3>
<p>貪米交易，仍因到貨稀少而見停頓。南市塲到貨九百六十九石，由公會議定，白粳薄稻杜秈高貨各爲一百元。北市塲到白粳一百石，以中貨價九十元開出。惟粥少僧多，不够分配，米店均難以購到，市塲缺貨現象頗爲嚴重。到貨不暢原因爲產地貨少，不易採購所致。</p>
<p>麵粉　議價未核定，市塲無貨可作交易，依舊停頓未開。暗中雜牌二號粉喊四十五元，又漲五元。零售甚感缺貨。麩皮供少求多，漲勢驚人，狂升八元，大包麩四十三元。</p>
<p>雜糧　價格騰升，黃豆到少，本街搜購甚勤，鄱陽子豆七十元，又漲十元。苞米紅糧北帮及酒精廠均納，各漲六七元。芝蔴天津帮化活，漲二成。生仁猛升四十元。</p>
<p>食油　無貨應市，上日廠方所供應食油三千一百担，定今日繳款，故昨暫緩開出。但因原料價高，豆油成本在三百元以上，勢難大量供應。豆餅客帮爭取，挺升八元，以三十三元成交。</p>

<h3>食糖靜候議價</h3>
<p>食糖昨日塲內仍無市，公會方面正靜候議價禁止會員內塲。惟因其他商品部份開放，業中人心頗爲活躍·塲內雖不准交易，但塲外則堅俏異常，更以本街門售商在限價期內，市民爭購熱烈，存底售去不少，多單者咸欲抵補，市上求多於供，喊價混亂。</p>

<h3>客幫廠商需求甚殷　紗布喊價俏利</h3>
<p>昨日中紡公司照例開布，計十二磅二十支AB　特細布價六十二元五角，限（門市染廠）由購，又美布〇一四—一七條府綢每公尺四元三角，限（門市）請購。　棉布市塲仍未恢復交易，詎塲外走勢奇暢，因各地布店在搶購潮中存底空虛，客帮需辦甚殷。昨以漢口帮與廣帮搜求較健，北帮及京杭沿綫各地來滬收購亦夥。近來本市供源，中紡公司不多開配，廠方以原料供應不暢，開貨仍有限制，有貨者觀望少售，市乃大俏。聞龍頭細布喊價由一百四十元抬至一百五十元，有人買進，惟成交不多。四君子元嗶嘰喊一百五十五元，本街布號以議價與喊價脫節過遠，脫手不易補進，故門市店家仍在停業中·　又訊，棉布塲外交易，當局對非法抬價仍在取締之列，聞樂園茶會，有三四掮客遭受千涉。</p>

<h3>東北風臨去秋波　三比一大勝志超　客軍表演精彩聯軍意外慘敗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕東北風足球隊來滬，三戰三和，先後與鐵路·靑白·中航打成平手。昨日下午第四戰臨去秋彼，卒大顯威風，以三比一擊敗中西合璧之本市勁旅志超隊，上半時東北風以二比零先佔優勢。昨日雖非週末假日，逸園座上客滿，球迷七千餘人，東北風號召力始終不衰。</p>
<p>志超雄心勃勃，志在必勝，前鋒有埠際名將小黃毛勞勃司托夫，及蘇聯好手諾弗高洛夫，格里納斯，中有鐵伏尼，後有大將吳褀祥坐鎭。昨日踢來，全部脫節，前鋒旣無默契，與後衛亦無呼應，一盤散沙，中路聯絡亦斷，吳褀祥從未發揮作用，守門庸弱。東北風傾全力釘住，活力遂被關煞，一籌莫展。東北風則越踢越有勁，尤以後衛防守之嚴密，守門亦穩，卒獲勝利。昨日之勝，吾謂勝在守得好，誠東北風初見之傑作。</p>
<p>志超開球，接戰十二分鐘，東北風陳動在廿碼外遠射，盛彼得竟接而復失，滑人網內，東北風創首先得球紀錄。此來彼往，又十分鐘，鐵伏尼失脚，郭鴻賓單騎急進，射中志超橫木彈入，東北風連得二球聲勢大振。上半時完畢二比零。下半時開始，志超志在反攻，猛烈進取，前鋒迭有精彩表演，看台上有叫好之聲，惜乎功虧一簣，攻勢又成過去。時去三十分鐘，志超敗局似已大定，此時於洽興猛撞陳勤，又犯十二碼，張吉良主踢，盛彼得雖拍得未能救出，東北風直落三大勝。再七分鐘東北風王承先亦犯手球，格里納斯踢十二碼，竟被閰承寬撲出。直至最後五分鐘，因閻承寬之衝出，格里納斯踢入，志超得以挽回一球，三比一未吃鴨蛋。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>限價取消以後</h3>
<p>— 雷霆</p>
<p>限價取消了，代之而起的是合理的調整。這一改，半月以來的搶購以及十店九空的怪形狀，自將一掃無餘；別的不說，緊張的情緒因之而略能鬆弛下來，落一個眼目淸淨，朱嘗不是一件不快中的快事。</p>
<p>八一九限價的是功是罪？這且不談。卽談也似乎無濟於事。然而一想到調整，如筆者這類「私敎」之流的薪水階級，眞有點不寒而慄，因而鬆弛的情緒又不由已的立刻緊張。</p>
<p>三年來，調整這一名詞，在一般人們心目中已成爲一個極可怕的魔影（當然，富豪們自可漫不關心，囤戶更要目爲「喜訊」；但這只是極少數的例外）。因爲，調整只是加價的另一稱謂。多數民衆旣成爲驚弓之鳥，自然要草木皆兵，我們又何忍譏其懦怯。雖說這次調整之上，更加上了一個頗可人意的「合理」，市民們大可少安毋燥。然而過去的調整，那一次不是經過官家的核准，才成爲合法的手續？試想：不合理，那能獲「准」？不合理，那能合「法」？？然而幸而不死於敵寇的摧殘，幸而不死於共匪的蹂躪的孑遺們，早被一再的「合理」壓得無以聊生了。</p>
<p>以上云云，並不是說限價的不應取消，也不是說搶購之風可任其蔓延，更不是說調整的不需合理；而是說：這一次改革，當局應如何使自然的限價來代替人爲的限價？使合理調整的理成爲多數民衆日夕所　求的「理」？一句話，要使物資的供應平衡，價不限而自限；要使民衆的收支平衡，物價雖漲而不致威脅其最低的生活。再來一句：要使廠商出品銷售得合理，民衆生活得合理。</p>
<p>當然，言之匪艱，行之維艱，寫兩句合理的話，自然是容易的。然而活是人的權利，求活更是人的權利。當局自然不能因爲「艱」而置之不聞不問，也不能因爲「艱」而有所偏頗，因爲這是一偶極嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>根據過去調整物價的經騐，生活指數是平衡薪水階級的唯一辦法。這一辦法的是否再行採用，目前尚不得而知。然單就採用的當時言，也眞是破綻百出。第一，它跟不上物價。第二，它每每不自覺地成爲促進物價的因素之一。第三，它有一定的範圍，而且這範圍又太小——臂如說：公敎人員有享受生活指數的權利，而「私敎人負」則一挺便要半年，卽使你最後兩個月的收入，只够供個人喝白開水，也沒人過問。（這不過是一個例。）如果這次公敎人員待遇的調整，還是這樣「仍舊貫」，這個「理」便有了問題了。</p>
<p>寫到這里，又使人想到搶購的男女「英雄」們了。搶購是不對的，也是不合法的；不搶購的當然是對的，守法的。然而物價一經調整，卽使是極合理的調整，漲，總是事實。物價一漲，佔便宜的還不是搶購的「英雄」們。循正軌的人處處吃虧，事事落後，不循正執的倒往往佔盡便宜；這又是一種什麽「理」？</p>
<p>當然，別人是可以反駁你的。因爲「處非常之變，必須要有非常之才」。反過來說，過去許多發國難財，勝利財以及「無法營業」財的，當然都是非常之才，卽使最容易的搶購，也非有機警敏捷的條件不可。據此，則無以爲生或卽將無以爲生如筆者之流，於懊恨愴痛之餘，只好怪自已的頭不尖，臉不厚，心不狠，手不辣，是一個天生的麻木胚子了。這樣一想，也似乎很合「理」。</p>
<p>這樣一來，「理」似乎是一條四通八達的通衢，在今日至少如此·然而蚩蚩者氓，已不能再忍受公有公的理婆有婆的理的「理」。</p>
<p>希望這次合理是眞正的合理，至少也該比較的合理！</p>
<h3>說夢</h3>
<p>— 斐宇</p>
<p>我們晚上時常做夢，夢的原因不外乎二：一是「日有所思，夜有所夢」，就是說夢是日間欲望的滿足，如財奴夢到金條，　餮夢到魚肉，登徒子夢到女人。二是「夜有所覺，乃有所夢」，就是說夢是睡時對感覺的解釋，如手壓胸前覺悶，就夢到奔跑氣喘；如身露被外覺冷，就夢到落水游泳；如身上某部份覺痛，就夢到打架受傷。</p>
<p>過去人對於夢兆以爲神秘不可思議，其實也很容易解釋。有人夢到遠方的親友死了，結果夢驗，就以爲是「魂遊」。其實我們總因爲好久沒有他的信，白天猜想他或者是出了事，晚上就做到這樣的夢。而這親友的所以沒信來，多半是爲的生了病或出了意外。這是很自然的契合，並沒有什麽神秘。</p>
<p>還有人夢到盜賊破屋而入，驚醒後發覺眞遭了盜竊。這是因爲我們睡時聽到賊進屋的聲音，就加以猜測：「這是什麽聲音？大概是有賊來了。」於是就夢到賊，說破了也不足爲奇的。</p>
<p>我國有一個民間傳說，說是一個人在煮黃粱的時候作了一個夢，夢中過了一生榮華富貴，醒來黃粱竟還未熟。作者知道有一個夢足可與之媲美。一個美國舊金山商人一天晚上作了一個怪夢。他夢見自己殺了人，事發後　察來捉他，他就菲飛機逃往紐約。警探追踪而來，他就再從紐約到加拿大，再經荷蘭到法國，途中受盡苦楚，警探仍是緊追不捨。最後錢也用完，在一所小旅館裏被警探包圍。他冒險從窗口跳下，逃進一個樹林，在林中精疲力盡，終於被捉。然後他又被解回舊金山審判。他被判死刑，不服，請律師上訴。上訴三次，都是敗訴，最後死刑定了。到了行刑的一天，他被架上斷頭臺。那時觀者雲集，他看到自己的親友都在塲，他知道死神已臨，心痛萬分。正在此時，斷頭刀已擊到他頸上。他一驚而醒，頸上眞擱着一個東西，不過不是刀，只是狀旁一個小衣架跌在他頸上而已。他睡中一覺得有東西打在他頸上，就想：「大概是殺頭吧。」爲什麼自己要被殺頭呢？一定是他犯了罪，於是逃呀追呀上訴呀，什麼都到他夢裏來了。黃粱燒熟至少要二三十分鐘，然而衣架的打下，到他的一驚而醒，至多不過二三秒鐘。在這樣短的時間裏，做那樣長的夢，可謂絕無僅有，比我國的黃梁夢更奇怪了。</p>

<h3>家鄉小景</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>每感到了生活的空虛的時候，便想往家鄕去走一趙，家鄉會給我溫情，充實了我的生活。</p>
<p>我的家鄉，在江南的大平原上，鵝黃色的稻田，在秋陽之下閃着金光，這明明表現了豐收的徵象。然而，你走向小城，會見到軋米的長蛇陣，會聽到食米的有價無貨，會看到一個老婆子三天沒有飯吃而在流淚……</p>
<p>假使，你在另一個角度來看：遊虞山的人比往年多，上王四酒家嘗油鷄者每感向隅，汽車，爬山虎（遊山的籐橋）絡繹不絕，公園裏的茶客滿座。這些鏡頭，却表現了家鄉的安謐與舒適。</p>
<p>可是，你再向大街小巷的各種舖子裏望一望，「十室九空」，並不算過分的形容，不要說肥皂，火柴等日用品不易買到，連寫字的藍墨水也發生了恐慌。</p>
<p>這已是新穀登塲的時候了，家鄕是產米的地方，並不是沒有米，就是辛勞的農家，不肯隨便把米賣掉，因爲：他們想把一石米換一箱固本肥皂，他們實在感到有了錢買不到肥皂用哩。</p>
<p>這是矛盾的現象，這也是時代的悲哀與恐懼，我這一次走往家鄕，家鄉使我的生活更覺得空虛。</p>
<h3>關於大戰史的著作</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰是人類的浩刦，戰後世人痛定思痛，無不希望這次大戰是人類最後一次的戰爭；但是前次戰爭的血跡未乾，第三次世界大戰却又在醞釀之中了。不論在歐洲或在亞洲，到處充滿了戰爭的謠言，眞是人類的不幸。在環球氣　低沉的今日，翻閱關於第二次大戰的書籍，覺得格外有意義。</p>
<p>美國出版界關於第二次大戰的著作，戰後紛紛問世，已經汗牛充棟；就是著作貧乏的中國，也已出版了好幾十種，拙著「第二次大戰史」竟銷售了五萬册；可是在英國出版界却不多見，最近英國文化委負會送來「大戰簡史」一册，是倫敦墨書恩出版社最近出版的，作者福爾斯先生，是牛津大學的戰史敎授，大戰期間，曾任倫敦泰晤士報的軍事記者，不僅在槍林彈雨之下採訪軍事新聞，而且每天在BBC向世界廣播大戰消息。</p>
<p>該書僅三百頁，售價十五先令，共分三十章，簡單扼要，將大戰的經過叙述一遍；因爲作者治「戰史」已有十六年的經驗，故其整理頭緒紛繁的戰史，頗能有條不紊；而且應詳盡的地方，特別詳盡；應簡略的地方，特別簡略；可謂「恰到好處」。在大戰簡史中是一部不易多得的名著，正合我們一般人的閱讀，故鄭重向讀者推　。</p>
<p>不過，此書也有它缺陷的地方。正因爲福爾斯是專攻戰史的人，他祗看到戰爭的進行，只知道戰綫的轉移；而忽略了政治經濟的背景，以致對於研究國際政治的學者，沒有什麼重要的貢獻。</p>

<p>緣淺　　騐玉巵，十分白　强禁持，目成幽意小燈知。</p>

<h3>皮肉</h3>
<p>在無處不肉，無餐不肉的故都，除猪牛羊等大牲之外，又有一種「　肉」，一向爲中流身分所不層一顧，即負販工徒之執菜於城市核心者，亦寧吃猪頭肉，羊雜碎，牛蹄筋，而不肯嚐　。惟關鄕內外之勞役民衆，嗜者頗多，所以從來就有此一行，營業亦盛，而不登「小雅之堂」（不但大雅）。</p>
<p>近因猪牛羊肉貨缺價昂，驢肉忽應時代之需要而暢銷，街頭巷尾，時有跨小木盒而大喊大資，或在閙市設攤，不只平民趨之若驚，即紳式男女亦有光顧，藉過肉　。在昔價目與三牲不成比例，如在戰前，猪肉價三角一斤，牛肉二角，驢肉不過二十個銅子（約四分錢），現在的醬　肉則每斤四元八角（金圓）—三毛錢一兩（法幣九十萬元）。（醫猪肉每兩一元上下，醬牛肉則五六毛一兩。）</p>
<p>醬　肉的做法，與牛羊肉一樣，用醬油及香料煮爛，其色紅紫，甚似牛肉，惟肉質較粗，不能混充牛肉（駱駝肉與牛肉相近，奸商偶用以攙合出售）據買食者言，其味亦不亞於牛肉之可口，並不似一般人想像之劣。又聞西北一帶人嗜驢肉，昔見秦腔班一老生角色，藝名「驢肉紅」，可知西俗風味之一斑。</p>
<p>人類之肉食嗜好，因地方而殊，亦有時代之變遷。即如「燕市屠狗」代表古代豪俠慷慨悲歌之士，而近代則狗肉甚少聞見。即今之燕市（平市）狗肉，惟有些特嗜之土人，私宰私食，尚不及馿肉之公然買賣，而淪陷時期之日人，嗜此特甚，命令僞組織的官員代爲搜捕，凡各街巷野狗竟被捉一空，人家豢養者，難免出外，亦往往失踪，以致家家覔犬，到警區吿狀，警區則命各家購買銅脾，掛於犬項，以資識別，此牌由偽官廳製售，又是一筆收入！日本人說吃狗肉是古風，他們國人輕死好武，原來「武士道」與吃狗肉有如許關係！是亦「衣冠唐世界，禮樂漢君巨」之一端歟？</p>
<p>一部水滸傳，許多梁山好漢都是「肉食」大家，不是熟鵝便是肥牛。現在人以「雞鴨」並舉，水滸則有雞有鵝面無鴨，因彼時以「鴨」爲詬辱之詞（如同後來以龜駡人），避鴨用鵝，實亦鴨也。至於多吃牛肉，宰及豬羊，則綠林及村衆大抵如此。舊時官方以私宰耕牛懸爲厲禁；以「牛耕田」有功於農，爲民食所依賴。而人家相戒不殺狗，則以「犬守夜」有功於家，忠於主人。此兩事皆有人畜間崇德報功之倫理觀念，與佛敎之普遍的戒殺生又有不同。</p>
<p>廣東有「龍虎饌」，係以貓與蛇會製，爲極珍貴之盛筵。北方儘多粤館，但從未見於菜單·因北人提及吃貓吃蛇，駭異動色，縱然預備，亦無問津·嗜好之不同，古今南北之變，眞「一言難盡」哉。</p>

<h3>Truman Re-elected as US President; President Chiang Sends Congratulatory Telegram; Dong Xian'guang Says People from All Walks of Life in Our Country Feel Gratified</h3>

President Truman's re-election at this critical juncture in the international situation gives people hope and earnestly anticipate his leadership during these difficult four years."</p>

<h3>Vice President Li's Remarks</h3>
<p>The United States Will Definitely Be Able to Provide More Vigorous Aid to China</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Vice President Li Zongren recently issued the following opinion on Truman's victory in the election and continued re-election: "In this US election, the two major US parties have given speeches, campaigned, held meetings, and organized parades in every corner of the United States over the past few months. This kind of democratic style and competitive method is especially meaningful for political education in our country. Now, at a time when crises pervade the situation in Europe and Asia, President Truman's election by the American people to continue in office is sufficient proof that Mr. Truman's past domestic and foreign policies have gained the support of the American people. Mr. Truman, being well-versed in the matter, will certainly be able to achieve world peace based on his past proposals. Regarding our country, I deeply believe that he will be able to provide more vigorous assistance."</p>
<h3>If China is Conquered, Peace Will Be Paralyzed</h3>
<p>General He Yingqin Calls for US Aid</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] Minister of National Defense General He Yingqin commented on Truman's re-election as US President on the 4th, saying: "The results of this US presidential election will not affect US policy towards China. Given the current situation, China needs a continuous flow of US aid." Mr. He said: "He believes the United States will provide China with economic and military assistance, both of which China urgently needs." When the reporter asked Mr. He to issue a letter to the American people, Mr. He said: "Frankly speaking, China urgently needs assistance. China is located in the key point of the Far East. If China is conquered, peace will be paralyzed." The reporter asked Mr. He whether he had reason to believe that the scope of action of the US military advisory group in China would be broadened, for example, whether US Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel would be permitted to take on more active roles, go to the front lines to observe battles, and give advice. Mr. He replied: "If the United States understands the seriousness of the situation and the opinions of the Chinese civil war, the status of the US military advisory group may change."</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Praises US General Election</h3>
<p>As an Example of the Vitality of American Democracy</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, today praised the results of the US general election as "a touching example of the vitality and vigor of American democracy" and assured the American people that our country "will continue to regard the United States as an old friend and hope that the United States will provide us with timely and generous assistance." In response to a request from the American press, he issued a statement saying that the election results "clearly show that the American people are the true masters of their motherland's destiny." The statement pointed out, "The orderly nature of the voting and the nationwide willingness to accept the opinion of the majority are truly admirable to our country. Our country is just entering the constitutional democratic path and will continue to regard the United States as an old friend, and when it resists the expansion of communism for the purposes of freedom and democracy, it hopes that the United States will provide timely and generous assistance." Officials at our embassy explained that the US election is purely an internal affair of the United States, but since the embassies of other countries had already responded to requests from the press, Ambassador Gu could not refuse to express his reaction.</p>
<h3>US Navy Still Staying in Qingdao; Remarks from Washington Diplomatic Circles</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Diplomatic circles stated on the 4th that the United States still intends to maintain US Navy personnel in Qingdao unless Communist troops approach the area. According to well-informed sources, in the current situation, there is no need for the US Navy to withdraw from Qingdao, as the areas around Qingdao have long been occupied by Communist troops. They stated that an untimely withdrawal would damage the United States' reputation throughout the Far East. However, they emphasized that if the safety of US troops is threatened by the Communists, the US troops and ships in Qingdao will withdraw immediately. Admiral Badger, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, has already been given orders for the withdrawal should the situation in Qingdao become more serious. Navy sources said that once the situation becomes serious, Admiral Badger can order the withdrawal of US troops and ships without seeking instructions from Washington or Navy Headquarters in Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>[United Press, This City News] US Navy authorities here today denied reports from Nanjing that US warships had agreed to transport munitions to resupply the National Army in North China.</p>
<h3>Production Business Loans Approved Will Be Released Immediately; Regulations for Adjusting Interest Rates of Banks and Credit Unions Planned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of responsible officials from the Central Bank on the morning of the 4th to discuss the policy for production business loans, and a draft was drawn up. It will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after the wording is organized. Once approved, it can be implemented, and production business loans can be released immediately. During the meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance on the morning of the 4th, Lin Chongyong, representative of the Central Bank, and Chen Dacheng, advisor to the Ministry, and several others attended, presided over by Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Currency Department. Regarding the policy for production business loans, the meeting made clear decisions based on the principles previously instructed by President Weng and with reference to the methods previously implemented by the Four Banks Joint Administration. The most important of these is that when national banks and bureaus underwrite loans, their sources of funds must not be obtained by issuing funds for lending, but must be raised from the deposits absorbed by the various banks and bureaus to serve as loans. At the same time, the Central Bank should continue to strictly handle rediscounts and re-mortgages, reducing them as much as possible. When the Central Bank handles rediscounts and mortgages, it should be based on the amount of "unified fixed deposits" and "loan reserve funds." If the amount of these two items is large, it can be handled; otherwise, it can be handled less. As for other national banks handling loans, they can decide on their own within a certain range. If this range is exceeded, it will be decided by the Central Bank's discount and loan committee. There are four loan targets: (1) production businesses for daily necessities, (2) basic industrial and mining businesses, (3) public utility transportation businesses, (4) export trade businesses, which are the same as the targets determined by the Four Banks Joint Administration. The loan methods have also been decided, including mortgage loans, export packing loans, and order loans. Loan interest rates were also discussed at the meeting, and it was decided to handle them in a separate case.</p>

In the future, the loan interest rates of national banks and bureaus will be agreed upon by the Central Bank's discount and loan committee in consultation with the various national banks and bureaus and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, commented yesterday on the impact of the US election on the situation in China, saying: "No matter who is elected President, it will not affect China policy.

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly Battle Report: Major Victory for National Army in Jinxi, Over 80,000 Bandits Wounded in Attack on Taiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released its "Weekly Battle Report" for October 28th to November 3rd on the 4th, stating: In the past week, the various battlefields, except for the Northeast and North China, have been relatively quiet in the Central China region. Apart from the National Army continuing to suppress and eradicate bandit remnants in northern Jiangsu and eastern Henan in the Central Plains, there were no major battles on the Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Longhai lines. The battle situations in the Northeast and North China are detailed below:</p>
<p>(1) Northeast Battlefield</p>
<p>The situation on the Northeast battlefield changed considerably during the week. In order to coordinate the overall situation and strive for a final victory, the National Army no longer stationed large forces at points and lines that had lost their strategic significance.</p>
<p>For three years, the Northeast National Army has done its utmost to maintain the national territorial sovereignty. After Changchun and Jinzhou fell to the bandits, the bandits again used the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 10th Columns to try to prevent the National Army from advancing westward in areas such as Heishan, Xinlitun, Banlamen, and Xinmin. Another force consisting of the 1st, 6th, 12th, etc. Columns and the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 10th Independent Divisions, as well as the Korean communist Li Hongguang's troops, roamed around the outskirts of Shenyang, starting from Xinmin in the west, Tieling in the north, Fushun and Benxi in the east, and Haicheng in the south, all engaged in combat. From October 30th to November 1st, the fighting approached Dongdaying, Beiling Airport, and Gaolichun. Our army inflicted heavy casualties on the bandits amidst their attacks and harassment from all directions. The fighting continued until dawn on the 2nd, when external communications from Shenyang were cut off. According to air force reconnaissance reports, our army has transferred in different directions according to the planned schedule. In the Liaoxi area, there has been continuous contact from Xinmin in the east to Juliuhe and Liaozhong. The bandits did not dare to use their main force to attack us in this area, so our army was able to safely transfer to designated areas according to the planned deployment. In the Jinxi area, the bandits' 4th and 11th Columns north of Gaoqiao are being severely attacked by our army. Jiangjiatun, west of Dayubao, has been recaptured by us. The bandits' 9th Column, suffering losses, fled north. At the same time, the bandits' Independent 4th Division, entrenched in Xingcheng, was defeated by us, and the city has been recovered. Currently, the active operations of the National Army in Jinxi have made the bandits afraid to confront them head-on.</p>
<p>(2) North China Battlefield</p>
<p>The Taiyuan offensive and defensive battles became increasingly fierce during the week. The bandits' New 4th Brigade and the Xin detachments, along with the 8th, 7th, and 15th three columns, with more than 50 artillery pieces, launched an all-out attack on the eastern city of Naoma Village, Xiaoyaotou, and the highlands south of Niutou Village from the afternoon of the 29th. Our army met them head-on and concentrated various firepower to suppress the attacking bandits. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented since the beginning of the Taiyuan defense. By dawn on the 30th, the bandits, suffering heavy casualties, saw their offensive falter. On the afternoon of the 31st and November 2nd, the bandits launched two offensives towards Naoma Village, Xiaoyaotou, Niutuozhai in the east of the city and Huangzhai Town in the north of the city. Except for the National Army in Huangzhai which transferred to nearby core positions and continued to fight fiercely with the bandits, the rest were repelled by us. In total, over the past month (from October 1st to 31st), the bandits attacking Taiyuan suffered over 83,800 killed and wounded, and 3,041 bandits were captured. Our army's casualties were only over 15,300 officers and men. The comparison shows how many innocent lives were sacrificed under the bandits' "human wave tactics." Although we lost some outposts, the price we paid was meaningful.</p>
<p>The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 8th Columns of Nie Rongzhen's bandits and the Yao Zhe bandit troops, who were roaming around the periphery of Gui-Sui, have been lurking in the mountainous areas in the past week, not daring to make large-scale movements. However, recently, the bandits occupying Sa County and Baotou have gathered in the west of Guisui, and scattered bandits are already active in areas 15 miles from the city.</p>
<p>Recently, the bandits' New 8th Division in the area north of Huailai and south of Longguan on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line attempted to attack Huailai by surprise, but were unexpectedly encircled and suppressed by the National Army in the area around Shangxia Douziying south of Longguan. In half a day of encirclement and annihilation, it is estimated that more than 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and 1,473 bandits were captured alive. 764 rifles, 34 light and heavy machine guns, 6 artillery pieces of various types, and many other military supplies were seized. The results are still being expanded. Our National Army, moving south along the Beijing-Baoding line, quickly captured Fangshun Bridge, Wangdu, Qingfengdian, and other places. The bandits' 7th Column, suffering losses, fled to both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. This kind of mobile strategic action by the National Army has induced the main forces of the bandits' 3rd and 4th Columns from southern Chahar to central Hebei, Yixian, and Mancheng. Ideal results may be achieved in this area.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Congratulations to Truman on His Re-election</h3>
<p>And May We Learn the Spirit of Democracy and Freedom of the United States</p>
<p>The U.S. presidential election results were announced at midnight on the 3rd. President Truman took the lead in 26 states, winning 304 electoral votes and being re-elected, while Dewey, who was generally predicted to win, surprisingly lost. When the news came out, the world was mostly surprised, viewing it as a miracle in American politics. In fact, President Truman's re-election is not worth being surprised about, not only can it not be considered a miracle in American politics, but it is also sufficient to represent the true spirit of American democratic politics.</p>
<p>Let us put aside the reasons for Truman's victory for the time being. The world's anticipation of Dewey's victory in the presidential election with almost complete certainty was due to the hints from various predictions made by the American broadcasting and newspapers. However, the American broadcasting and newspapers may not be able to truly represent public opinion, especially in the heat of the campaign, broadcasting and newspapers are regarded as propaganda, even if it wants to control public opinion, it cannot control the free will of the American people. It is only because American citizens have a high level of knowledge, each has his own views on the government's policies, and is by no means a blindly following crowd who parrots what others say, and the election system is truly secret and free, no one can use the slightest coercive method to influence others' voting. Therefore, President Truman's election is a lofty expression of the democracy and freedom enjoyed by the general American people, worthy of our admiration and learning. As Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, said: "The American people have complete and absolute freedom to choose the public servant who governs the country." Indeed, the result of this election is a powerful demonstration of true democracy in American politics.</p>
<p>This matter is very clear to third parties, that is: American voters support President Truman, allowing him to be re-elected, probably because Truman is full of the spirit of struggle. Truman's performance in the past three years has been seen differently by different people, and there may be disagreements. However, the current world situation is critical, on the verge of collapse, and changing rapidly. The objective situation does not allow the US government to change, let alone allow a more than two-month "vacuum" period in American politics, giving the aggressor totalitarianists an opportunity. Everyone knows that in recent years, the American people are not only well-informed about world affairs, but also have a clear understanding of them. Everyone understands the true meaning of the "Truman Doctrine" and everyone understands the role of the "Marshall Plan." Facing the fact that the United States has been making concessions step by step in the "Cold War," it is naturally not allowed for the Truman government to retreat again in the face of violence, but Truman is required to continue to work hard to carry out his original intention. In this election, from the very beginning, the outside world spread the atmosphere that Dewey could win, this atmosphere increased day by day, but President Truman did things his own way, still actively struggling, until the last day of voting, without the slightest slackness. This spirit of struggle is the spirit needed by the United States in dealing with major domestic and foreign problems. The reason why American citizens elect Truman may not be unrelated to this. Because the political platforms and policies of the two major parties, the Democratic and Republican parties, are not much different in nature, especially the foreign policy pursued by the Truman government, is a policy unanimously agreed upon by both parties. Secretary of State Marshall attended any international conference, and Republican dignitaries such as Vandenberg and Dulles attended together. Before deciding on the policy on any major international issue, he must also reach a consensus agreement with Republican dignitaries. It can be seen that the choice of American voters this time is not necessarily a choice of policy, but a choice of who is more suitable to deal with the overall situation. They believe that in order for the United States to cope with the current critical world situation, instead of entrusting the heavy responsibility to a newcomer to take risks and try, it is better to let the current government handle it with ease, and besides, Truman's re-election can also fill the political "vacuum" of more than two months.</p>
<p>As for observing from the perspective of American domestic affairs, Dewey's failure may be attributed to the 80th U.S. Congress. Why do you say that? After the end of the war, the general public seemed to be tired of the Democratic Party's long-term rule, and there were some disappointments with the Truman government's performance, so when the members of Congress were re-elected, the majority of people tended to the Republican Party, and this 80th Congress was under the control of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, the bills passed and the activities carried out by the 80th Congress inevitably ran counter to the wishes of the people in terms of domestic affairs, especially the Taft-Hartley Act, which deprived workers of the right to strike, was rejected by the general public. As Green, Chairman of the American Federation of Labor, said: "The American people have clearly expressed their rejection of the reactionary spirit of the 80th Congress. The Democratic Party must launch a 'progressive action' to abolish the reactionary labor law." From this, it can be seen that the 80th Congress invisibly created a bad impression, causing most voters to shift from leaning towards the Republican Party to the Democratic Party again. But in any case, when the Democratic Party was about to go downhill, it was revived by President Truman's leadership. Although it was promoted by some points of the Republican Party's domestic policy, President Truman can be proud of it after all.</p>
<p>In short, the wishes of American voters today are: for the world, they hope that the government can calmly cope with the offensive of the "Cold War," reverse the tide of the world, and create lasting peace; for the United States, they hope that the government will continue to implement the "New Deal," strive for economic rationalization, eliminate the black shadow of the current economic panic, and maintain domestic stability and prosperity. This time, President Truman won from a dangerous situation, and he will be able to better understand the wishes of the people. He will strive with all his strength for world peace and American prosperity, so as not to disappoint the expectations of millions of voters who enthusiastically support him.</p>
<h3>Suspects Who Burned Down the British Consulate in Shamian Tried in Guangzhou Special Criminal Court Yesterday, Prosecutors and Defense Lawyers Request Leniency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] The Guangzhou Higher Special Criminal Court held its first public trial of nineteen suspects accused of burning down the British Consulate in Shamian on the 4th to 6th. The court opened at 9:30 AM on the 4th, with Court President Fu Shilan serving as the presiding judge. Prosecutor Xie Songya first stood up and stated the reasons for the prosecution, saying that the evidence of the defendants' crimes was confirmed through interrogation, but the defendants were all young and vigorous, and their motives for committing the crime were likely due to temporary indignation, with no intention of offending. The judge was asked to consider this point and reduce the punishment appropriately. Due to time constraints, Luo Gang (typesetter at Daguang Newspaper), Situ Guang (student at Sacred Heart High School), Liu Su (vendor), Feng Zhao (student at Nanwu High School), and Liang Jian (vendor) were interrogated first. They confessed that they were arrested by military police as suspects for watching the excitement in Shamian or the west bridgehead of 622 Road two or three hours after the British Consulate was burned down at 1:30 PM on January 16th this year. The defendants' defense lawyers Shen Zhenzhong, Chen Yuheng, and others stood up one after another and argued that the defendants' statements could be proven by facts, and they could not be found guilty simply by listening to the accusations of one or two military police. Moreover, the relevant witnesses had not been interrogated by Zhu before concluding that they were guilty, and the defendants' places of origin, residences, and occupations were all different, and the indictment could not be designated as accomplices and joint offenders. Furthermore, the occurrence of this case was the result of the destruction of Chinese residences in Kowloon City by the Hong Kong government. At that time, our diplomatic commissioner in Guangdong and Guangxi stated that if this caused an unfortunate reaction, the Hong Kong government should be responsible. Subsequently, the case was caused by the Guangdong-Guangzhou-Kowloon Incident Support Association mobilizing the public to march. It can be seen that even if it is a crime, it is not a personal problem of the defendants. Moreover, since the defendants are not communist cadres and the evidence is insufficient, they should be acquitted. The trial of Deng Jinheng, Liang Changming, Zheng Feixiong, Chen Yipu, Bao Hanzhuo, and Li Xiantai will continue at 2:30 PM, and the rest will be interrogated on the 5th and 6th.</p>

<h3>Returning from a Trip to the Southwest: Zhang Junmai Delivers a Speech; Deepest Impression is the Universal Desire for Reform</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, flew back to this city from Chengdu on the 3rd. On the 4th, he met with reporters and spoke extensively about his impressions of his trip to the Southwest, saying that the situation in the southwestern provinces was much more stable than here, and that the most profound impression of this trip was that all places were eager for reform, otherwise the current situation would be difficult to maintain. Even within the Kuomintang itself, there was suffering and a desire for change. In terms of political reform, the most important thing is to revise the excessively centralized system, so that local areas can do things. This principle applies equally to military and party affairs. The pessimism of the current situation is a well-known fact. The President should have an even more thorough understanding upon his return from his northern inspection tour. As for American aid, it must be based on self-help in order to be effectively obtained, and there must be absolutely no dependence. The United States' policy toward China will be revised in the future, but whether it will become active or passive depends on whether the Chinese people are revitalized. It is generally understood that American aid to China will not exceed the scope of supplying arms and materials, and military aid will not be reversed to support volunteer forces. If the situation in our country continues to deteriorate, the United States will inevitably withdraw from North China and Qingdao, and its actions in South China will also be limited, because it will never be willing to engage in direct conflict with the Chinese Communist Party. Regardless of whether the Democratic or Republican Party comes to power, they will both follow the bipartisan foreign policy, which is essentially no different, because this is necessary to cope with the difficult situation in the world. It is expected that Truman will conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union after being re-elected, but whether the East-West deadlock can be broken will depend on the skills of the negotiators. The basic interests of the two countries do have areas of conflict, but they are not enough to resort to war. The war propaganda on both sides is very fierce, but in reality, it is another matter.</p>
<p>Zhang originally planned to go to Kunming, but the situation was urgent, so he returned to Shanghai early. He is now studying the current situation based on reports from within the party and said that he does not plan to go to Beijing in the short term.</p>

<h3>Truman Will Reorganize the Government, Accelerate the Export of Foreign Aid Military Supplies, and the Situation in China is Also Under Consideration; Marshall and Forrestal May Retire Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] Due to Truman's election, the United States' plan to rearm Europe will be expanded. At the same time, seven senators and twelve representatives who opposed American foreign aid programs (including economic recovery or military aid) have been defeated. Therefore, it is generally expected that the administration will now accelerate the completion of the military defense alliance plan with Western Europe and accelerate the shipment of military supplies loaned to non-communist countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Independence City, Missouri, 4th] President Truman gave a radio address in his hometown on the evening of the 2nd, saying that after his election, he deeply understood the great responsibility for world peace and welfare. This election was not a victory for him personally, but a victory for the Democratic Party and the people. Truman offered a promise to the nation to realize the Democratic Party's platform announced during the election campaign and asked the nation to assist in this task.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The main focus of President Truman's foreign policy after being re-elected will be one major question: to what extent is the United States willing and able to invest more money and resources in the Cold War against the Soviet Union? According to diplomatic authorities, Truman's answer to this question will largely depend on the scope and effectiveness of his entire anti-communist plan in his second term. The emergence of this question is related to the three major dangerous areas in the world: first, Western Europe wants to conclude a military alliance with the United States and lease military supplies. Military experts estimate that the cost will be more than two billion yuan per year. Second, in China, the United States is facing an urgent crisis as the National Government suffers military victories from the Communist Party. Third, in Greece, although American military aid has prevented the Communist guerrillas from controlling the entire country, it has also failed to eliminate them. The next session of the United States Congress may discuss a larger military aid program.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman returned to the White House from his hometown on the 4th to continue Roosevelt's traditional politics. Truman's new government is bound to implement the New Deal, increase taxes and discretionary spending, and the political line will target the middle class. The President will return to Washington on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Truman, who was considered to be in dire straits, was surprisingly elected as President of the United States today, which is a major upset in American political history. The new government will appear with a new look. Secretary of State Marshall is planning to retire and is reportedly preparing to resign in February next year. Secretary of Defense Forrestal may also retire. Former Undersecretary of State Acheson is rumored to succeed Marshall as Secretary of State, and Republican leaders will undoubtedly be replaced. Dewey, who failed to win the election twice in ten years, stated that he was unwilling to try again, suggesting that he might withdraw from the political stage.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Diplomatic circles believe that Truman may appoint Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Vinson, as the new Secretary of State to succeed Marshall. It is reported that Truman and Vinson's opinions are closer on foreign policy.</p>
<h3>US Two Parties Contend for Control of Congress; Republican Party Suffers Complete Defeat; House of Representatives Sharply Reduced by More Than One Hundred and Seventy Seats</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 4th] The contrast of seats between the Democratic and Republican parties in the old and new Congresses is as follows:</p>
<p>New Congress (81st)</p>
<p>Democratic Party: Senate 54 seats</p>

<p>House of Representatives 184 seats Increase of 73 seats</p>
<p>Senate 51 seats Decrease of 9 seats</p>
<p>House of Representatives 243 seats Decrease of 176 seats</p>
<p>In addition, the left-wing American Labor Party occupies one seat in the new House of Representatives, losing one seat compared to the old House of Representatives. There are six vacancies in the old House of Representatives. As of 7:00 AM Eastern Standard Time on the 4th, there are still ten seats in the House of Representatives that have not been determined, of which the Democratic Party is leading in five seats, and the Republican Party is also leading in five seats.</p>
<h3>New US Congressmen; Eight Women Elected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd, United Press] In this election, eight women were elected as members of the House of Representatives (four Democrats, four Republicans). There may be a total of nine female members in the 81st Congress, an increase of two from the previous session.</p>
<h3>Dewey Decides to Support Bipartisan Foreign Policy; Indicates That He Will No Longer Run for President</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] Dewey, the defeated Republican presidential candidate, walked the last mile of his journey on the American political stage this morning. In his farewell letter to the people, he urged continuous and vigorous support for President Truman's bipartisan foreign policy. Dewey held a special press conference at the Roosevelt Hotel, the same location where he first suffered defeat four years ago, stating that it is necessary to support the foreign policy established through cooperation between the Democratic and Republican parties after the war. He believes that the international situation is extremely urgent, and the world has encountered the darkest weekend due to the crises in China and Greece. Dewey is now completely detached from the national political stage and has announced that he will no longer run for president in the future. Dewey himself expressed surprise at this defeat but did not explain the reasons for Truman's victory.</p>
<h3>The United States' New Policy Toward China Depends on the New Foreign Affairs Committee; Truman Has Never Rejected Resolutions of This Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press, Pittsburgh, 4th] Congressman Fulton, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told the United Press on the evening of the 3rd that the new policy toward China will be determined by the selection of four successors to the Foreign Affairs Committee by the Speaker of the House. He said: "The character of the four successors will have a significant impact on China. In the past, Truman has always accepted the judgment of the Foreign Affairs Committee and has never rejected any resolutions of the committee. Therefore, the future policy toward China depends more on the House Foreign Affairs Committee than on the President. Appropriations bills will be proposed by the House of Representatives, and the execution of policy is actually money. The new policy may be greatly influenced by the fact-finding trip of the bipartisan joint committee investigating Pacific policy, especially when Senator Barkley is a member of the committee. This travel plan was previously postponed due to the general election."</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Pleases Labor; Plans to Abolish Anti-Labor Law</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] Reichans, the current chairman of the US House Labor Committee, announced on the evening of the 3rd that after the Democratic Party has won the election, it will restore workers' rights. He also stated that he would draft a new bill to abolish the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act. This new bill will be submitted to the House of Representatives soon.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Firmly Rejects American Plan for Controlling Atomic Energy; Vyshinsky Launches Counterattack at the General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 4th] The UN General Assembly today discussed the majority party plan and the Soviet Union's plan passed by the Political Committee. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke, refusing to accept the majority party plan and believing that an agreement could not be reached between the East and West on the atomic energy control plan, and that the Soviet Union's plan should be passed. US Representative Austin advocated passing the majority party plan yesterday. Vyshinsky's remarks today are the counterattack of the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] US Representative Austin delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly today, stating that the unanimous vote of confidence in the United Nations for the United States' world atomic energy control plan will help bring the world closer to true atomic safety. He specifically endorsed a proposal in the draft resolution to be discussed by the General Assembly, namely that the five powers and Canada jointly consult. The purpose of these consultations will be to study whether there is a basis for agreement between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the issue of atomic energy. He said, "The United States hopes that these consultations should be of a high-level nature, with the main aim of exploring the reasons why the Soviet Union is currently unwilling or unable to cooperate with other countries in terms of the measures it deems necessary to maintain peace."</p>
<h3>American People Willing to Have a Slightly Left-Leaning Government; Perhaps It Was Truman's Ace</h3>
<p>[Washington, 3rd] Political observers unanimously view Truman's unexpected victory as an indication that the American people are willing to have a slightly more left-leaning government. The entire tendency of Truman's election campaign was to move further to the left, especially because it had to compete with Wallace's slogans. The majority of the American people clearly fully agreed with this tendency.</p>
<h3>Various Reactions to Truman's Re-election as President</h3>
<p>Britain and France Rejoice</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] The British and French governments expressed satisfaction with Truman's re-election as president, as it is generally believed that this indicates that the American people hope to continue Roosevelt's New Deal, and the new American government will continue the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Indifferent</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] The results of this American election are seen as just another victory for the reactionaries in the eyes of the Soviet Union. They believe that there is essentially no difference whether Truman or Dewey wins.</p>
<p>Arabs Disappointed</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] The Arab delegation attending the UN General Assembly was disappointed with Truman's election, believing that Truman's victory means that the Jews in the Holy Land can obtain more money and support from Jews.</p>
<h3>The Tokyo Tribunal Acquits the Major Japanese War Criminals of Massacre and Atrocities; Only Conspiracy to Aggression is Used as a Basis for Judgment; Judge Webb Began Reading the Verdict Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] The Far East International Military Tribunal reconvened on the 4th and began reading the final verdicts for Tojo and the other 24 Japanese Class A war criminals. Out of the 55 counts of indictment, only 17 were read on the 4th. It is generally expected that the period for reading the verdict will last for at least one week to ten days.</p>
<p>The final prologue to this trial, which has lasted for two and a half years, was unveiled at 9:30 AM Tokyo time on the 4th in the former Japanese military headquarters building. Chief Justice Webb of Australia began reading the 1,800-page verdict of the eleven-nation tribunal in a firm and clear tone.</p>
<p>The preparation period for this verdict lasted for more than six months. The counts of indictment read on the 4th accused the defendants of planning, preparing, and launching wars of aggression, and conspiring to commit murder and mass killings. The courtroom was filled with Japanese and Allied observers. This extremely confidential verdict is divided into three chapters: the first chapter describes the general trial, including legal issues and the legal perspectives investigated by the court; the second chapter describes each defendant; and the third chapter includes the judgment and the announcement of the execution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The International Tribunal's final verdict this morning on the 25 Class A Japanese war crime suspects excluded 38 of the counts of indictment against the defendants, including the Nanjing Massacre and the atrocities of the Japanese army in China, and only used the conspiracy and war of aggression as their crimes. For technical reasons, the court only considered 17 of the original 55 counts of indictment in order to avoid repetition. The counts of indictment against Tojo and other defendants that the court canceled included the Nanjing Massacre and the atrocities of the Japanese army in Guangzhou, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Hong Kong, and other places. The final verdict stated that if the defendants are proven to have engaged in wars of aggression, then they are responsible for the illegal killings during the entire war. Some of the counts of indictment were repetitive, and some were alternating. The 17 actual crimes included the conspiracy and war of aggression against China. The final verdict did not address the accusations against the court's power to interrogate war crime suspects. The verdict stated, "The attacks on the court's power have completely failed." The final verdict is very long and is divided into three parts: history, jurisprudence, and conspiracy. The defendants' lawyers originally said that Japan's wars of aggression were merely discontinuous events, but the court considered it to be an entire conspiracy against peace. The International Tribunal reconvened after a six-week recess. The three defendants, namely Umezu Mijiro, Shira Toru Minoru, and Hiranuma Kiichiro, did not appear in court due to illness. Shiratori only has a cold and will be able to appear in court soon. The other defendants have not changed in appearance since their last appearance before June. They have been on trial for two years and seem to be deeply pleased to appear in court at this time. There were originally 28 Class A suspects, but only 25 remained to hear the final verdict after two years of trial. Former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke and Admiral Nagano Osami have died of illness, and Okawa Shumei has gone mad.</p>
<h3>Mental Illness Has Been Cured; Okawa Writes Articles in Prison</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Okawa Shumei suddenly went mad when the court first opened on May 3, 1946, covering his face and sobbing, and hitting Tojo's head with force. Therefore, the authorities sent him to the hospital for mental illness, and he has returned to normal after treatment. It is said that Okawa has recently been writing a research paper on Islam in prison and is very calm. (According to reports, Tokyo began announcing the Class A war criminals today, but Okawa is still in Yokohama).</p>
<h3>Trial Lasted Two and a Half Years; Cost Seven Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] According to the Associated Press, the trial of the Tokyo war criminals has lasted for two and a half years. If calculated in terms of money spent, it is approximately US$10,000 per day, which is about three times higher than the trial expenses for the German war criminals, with a total of US$7.5 million.</p>

<h3>Distribution Disputes; Tobacco Factory Vandalized; Manufacturers Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>After the opening of price limits, cigarette retailers have made huge profits from selling cigarettes and have applied to various cigarette factories for distribution. The four factories, Fuhua, Lehua, Xingkang, and Sino-American, have experienced incidents of vandalism. According to the Cigarette Business Association, this was caused by the fact that the factories did not follow the method of universally distributing goods based on cards and sold their inventories to a small number of tobacco merchants, resulting in disputes and conflicts. Cigarette factories such as Huacheng, Nanyang, Yongtaihe, Dadongnan, and Zhonghua have fair distribution methods, and no disputes have occurred. It is heard that the factory association and the cigarette business association are discussing reasonable solutions.</p>
<h3>Southern Goods Stores Have No Goods to Sell; Over Seven Hundred Merchants Petition</h3>
<p>Gather at the Association and Propose Four Demands</p>
<p>Southern goods stores have no goods to open for business. Approximately 700 store owners and managers of southern goods stores gathered at the Southern Goods Business Association yesterday morning to petition, specifically proposing four points: (1) Please order the authorities to order the seafood, northern goods, cassia, melon seeds, and seasoning industries to quickly supply goods at reasonable prices. (2) Please order the authorities to order the above-mentioned wholesale merchants to allocate goods to members at the limited price once according to the amount of transactions between each merchant and its members before August 19, in order to maintain the balance of hardship and fairness. (3) In order to balance the burden of citizens and prevent profiteering, please inform the Taiwan Sugar Company that it should directly distribute sugar to the southern goods stores in order to match the actual distribution and sales and avoid intermediate exploitation. (4) Most small-scale operators are unable to recover, and it is proposed that the authorities be requested to grant loans or lend confiscated goods to subsidize them. They requested that the association forward the petition to the authorities for relief, and if it could not be achieved, it would be difficult to open for business. The person in charge of the association agreed to immediately forward the petition to the authorities and wait for instructions, and the petitioners dispersed.</p>

According to a responsible person from the Bureau speaking to our reporter: After the authorities decided to open price limits, the Bureau's stores and special commissioned dealers still opened as usual on the 1st, supplying various goods to public educators at the original prices. However, the order was too chaotic on that day, and non-public educators and those holding accumulated points certificates of public educators also relied on their strength to purchase goods. The pressure from the outside world on the Bureau was too great. Therefore, in order to protect the welfare of public educators, they had to find another proper way to reopen. Now, after consultation between the Bureau and the relevant authorities, a decision can be made today, and the Bureau's stores and special commissioned dealers should be able to resume business tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Soochow Law School Dining Committee – Accused of Profiteering by Falsely Claiming Rice Rations</h3>

<h3>Exchange Settlement Firms and Factories – Enthusiastically Paying Special Donations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the Shanghai District Relief Special Donation was launched, it initially failed to raise the full amount. The Solicitation Committee decided to follow the instructions of the central government and levy a small amount from those receiving foreign exchange. After the implementation of this micro-donation method, many exchange settlement firms and factories paid enthusiastically. Especially after the recent opening of price limits, the settled exchange rate remained unchanged, and various manufacturers found the donation amount even more insignificant. They flocked to inquire, and the committee is now stepping up the issuance of collection notices and notifying the Shanghai City Bank at No. 50 Jiujiang Road that exchange settlement firms and factories that have not received the collection notice from the committee are allowed to pay the special donation first, and the city bank will issue a temporary receipt, which will be reported to the committee for exchange of a formal receipt, in order to show solemnity.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Wu Xiaomei, a young girl from No. 1 Zhangjiazhai, Dongchang Road, Pudong, was walking with two girlfriends at around 8:40 last night to go shopping. Suddenly, two people wearing yellow uniforms passed them, and another person followed behind, blocking the three girls' path and robbing them. They were dragged to a dark and desolate field, intending to commit indecent acts. Later, upon hearing people approaching, they released them. Wu and the others rushed home and tearfully told her brother Wu Kuixin (26 years old, local), who is a militia member of the Yangjing Police Station. Upon hearing the report, Wu was extremely angry and gathered several other militia members, dividing into two groups to encircle the area. Before long, Wu Kuixin and the others saw the group approaching. Just as they were about to question them, the other party suddenly opened fire twice. One bullet hit Wu in the chest. After being wounded, Wu also drew his gun and returned fire six times, but none hit, and the assailants managed to escape. Wu was escorted to Renji Hospital for treatment by his companions. It is reported that he is mentally unstable and his life is in danger.

<h3>Yang Chuoan Analyzes – Food Rationing Situation in Six Major Cities – Shortage Last Month – To Be Fully Allocated Around the 20th</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yang Chuoan, chairman of the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Committee, analyzed the rice supply situation in the six major cities to reporters yesterday, stating: Shanghai needs a total of 550,000 dan of rationed rice in October, of which 435,000 dan have arrived, leaving a shortage of 115,000 dan. After deducting the 7,000 dan of rationed rice for public educators, which can be allocated in cash, the actual shortage is only 108,000 dan, which is expected to arrive in full around the 20th of this month. In Nanjing, a total of 130,000 dan is needed in October, of which 115,000 dan have arrived, leaving a shortage of 15,000 dan, which can also be resolved around the 20th. Thanks to Chairman Song's efforts, Guangzhou has raised all the required amount locally. Tianjin and Beijing need 1.3 million bags of flour in October, which has also been fully raised, and 1 million bags have been transported. There is still a shortage of 300,000 bags, half of which are awaiting shipment, and the flour mills can deliver the remaining 150,000 bags before mid-month. Qingdao has no problem with food rationing in October. As for the price of rationed rice, there will be no changes in October, but November is difficult to say. Because the price of rationed rice is much lower than the market price, it all depends on government subsidies. The national treasury cannot bear the burden, and the purpose of rationing is to ensure that people receive the supply of materials, not as a form of relief. Therefore, some people advocate raising the price of rationed rice, while others advocate keeping the rationed price unchanged, fearing that raising the price of rice will affect the overall price level. Both sides have their points, and it remains to be discussed and decided in the future. Chairman Yang believes that the government-controlled areas are still self-sufficient in food, but the biggest problem at present is that farmers refuse to sell their rice because the income from selling rice is not enough to buy essential goods. After the abolition of price limits, procurement work has been smoother than before, but because the price of rice has risen sharply, the previously planned funds are insufficient for use. At present, the procurement area of the Food Procurement Committee is limited to the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Chairman Yang finally stated that the sources of food in the past were complex, with the China Trust Bureau, the American Aid Council, the China Relief Organization, and the Economic Cooperation Administration all providing food supplies. The proceeds from the sale of rice were deposited in the Central Bank and were not clearly marked, fearing confusion over time. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a Food Source and Fund Clearing Committee to start clearing them up.</p>
<h3>Community Bureau Did Not Order Rice Shops to Sell Stored Rice – Named Purchase Can Be Reported for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Several rice shops in this city published announcements in newspapers yesterday, stating: All customers' food rice purchased and not yet picked up in the past must be supplied to the store according to the authorities' orders, otherwise they will be punished for hoarding. Therefore, all stored rice has been sold at the limited price in the store, and customers are required to go to the store with their certificates to settle the payment within five days or one week. After the deadline, the balance will be deposited in the bank on their behalf to clear the procedures. Several rice shops also posted the above measures at the entrance, claiming that they were ordered by the "Community Bureau," etc. According to the director of the Social Affairs Bureau speaking to reporters: He has not heard anything about the process and handling methods of this matter. All civil disputes are handled by the competent authorities according to law. The Social Affairs Bureau has no right to overstep its authority. If any rice shop continues to use the name of the Social Affairs Bureau, the parties concerned can report to the police station and thoroughly investigate and pursue the matter according to law.</p>

<h3>Xuanhuai Steamer of China Merchants Bureau Sinks off Yingkou – More Than Twenty Crew Members Missing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Merchants Bureau's Xuanhuai transport steamer was ordered to go to Yingkou on official business from Tanggu at the end of last month. After arriving in Yingkou, it was carrying more than 2,000 troops and more than 1,000 captured soldiers on the 1st of this month. It was originally scheduled to set sail at midnight on that day, but the ship tilted due to overloading, so it did not dare to exit. However, at this time, it was learned that fighting had broken out five miles away, and faint gunfire was heard. While hesitating, the explosives in the cabin suddenly exploded, causing great chaos. Moreover, with the enemy approaching, they had no choice but to lead the crew to take another small steamer to exit. At that time, several ships, including the Haifei steamer and landing craft 101 and 102, were anchored outside the port, so they boarded the Haifei steamer and withdrew from Yingkou with the various boats. After checking the crew members, about twenty people were missing. The Haifei steamer is currently sailing from Huludao to Tianjin. The crew members of the Xuanhuai steamer will transfer ships to return to Shanghai after arriving in Tianjin. It is said that the Xuanhuai steamer has sunk.</p>

<h3>Retrial of Stock Dumping Case Concluded – Three Defendants Granted Bail – High Court Scheduled to Announce Judgment on the 11th of this Month</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the stock dumping case involving the suspicion of leaking news of currency reform, the four defendants, Lin Legeng, Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, and Xu Yangshuyao, were sentenced by the local court for violating the Exchange Law. Tao Liguolan was sentenced to ten months in prison, Lin and Du were each sentenced to eight months in prison, and Xu Yangshuyao was sentenced to seven months in prison. Except for Tao Liguolan, who gave up the appeal, the others did not accept the original judgment and appealed to the High Court. Xiao Xieirong, the presiding judge of the High Court, judges Feng Zhidong and Chen Zhensheng, held a collegial panel hearing yesterday morning, and prosecutor Qu Rong also attended the court to prosecute. Du Weiping stated: In name, I am the old Guan of Hongxing Securities, but all daily affairs are the responsibility of the manager Qiu Yunzhang. Because the import and export business of Huamei Trading Company could not be started, I also did not go, and at the same time, I was sick and did not ask about foreign affairs. As for the confession to the police station, I was only asked to sign at that time, and I was not given a detailed look, so it is not credible. Lin Legeng stated: Although Qiu Yunzhang had talked to me about buying and selling Yongsha at that time, I did not accept the buying and selling behavior. Even if it is considered inappropriate, it is an incomplete act. Xu Yangshuyao stated: It was my first time buying and selling stocks. I was completely delighted to see the opportunity and tried it by chance. I didn't know what was inside or outside the market, and I had no criminal intent. After the defense lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Yu Chengxiu, and Yu Zhongluo defended the defendants, and applied for bail, the court ordered that the judgment be announced on the morning of the 11th. Du and Lin each paid 5,000 yuan in cash and a shop guarantee, and Xu and Yangshuyao paid 2,000 yuan in cash and a shop guarantee, and were allowed to be released on bail pending trial.</p>

<h3>40,000 Pots of Famous Varieties – Participate in the Chrysanthemum Exhibition – Unique Romance of Appreciating Flowers in the Mist</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The 37th Chrysanthemum Exhibition organized by the Municipal Garden Management Office has been officially scheduled to open on the 6th. Fuxing Park was not open for the past two days for arrangement and organization. All displays can be completed by noon today, and a preview will be held for all sectors of society at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The internal and external design of this exhibition is exceptionally elegant. At the entrance, there is a large oil painting of yellow chrysanthemums by the famous sculptor Liu Kaiqu. The original fountain in the park has been raised, and the surrounding area is filled with famous chrysanthemums. The horizontal plaque is inscribed with the four characters "Appreciating Chrysanthemums in the Mist." The atmosphere of evaluation and appreciation in the misty atmosphere is indeed unique. The layout of the venue is simple and majestic. In order to prevent the audience from gathering in one place, the association has specially classified and displayed the famous varieties of chrysanthemums. For example, those belonging to the various nurseries directly under the management office include five categories classified according to morphology: single-stem, grafted, three-stem, cliff chrysanthemum, and pagoda chrysanthemum. There are eleven categories classified according to variety: fragrant chrysanthemum, flying dance chrysanthemum, back curl chrysanthemum, supporting cinnamon chrysanthemum, aster chrysanthemum, hair chrysanthemum, Meng chrysanthemum, Yunzuo chrysanthemum, Gui Meng chrysanthemum, Yun Meng chrysanthemum, and single petal chrysanthemum. Including those participating in various groups, the total number is about 40,000 pots. Famous flower nurseries in this city, such as Guo Lingshuang's Heng Garden, Huang Yueyuan's Huang Garden, Zhang Lianting's Ming Garden, as well as the two road bureaus, various private farms, and members of the Flower and Tree Industry Association, have sent famous chrysanthemums to participate in the exhibition. The association has also specially opened a competition section, dividing them into three categories: single-stem, three-stem, and standing chrysanthemum, numbered. After the public exhibition, the association will invite artists, horticultural professors from various universities, and flower lovers in the community to freely evaluate them. According to the association: Ticket offices are being added recently, and the ticket price is set at 2 jiao. The more spectacular aspects of this year's chrysanthemum exhibition compared to last year are that the varieties have increased to nearly 500, and there is a pot of standing chrysanthemums with 169 flower heads, which are extremely precious. (The attached picture is a pot of standing chrysanthemums, the Nanyang Dabai, with a total of 127 flowers. Our newspaper took the photo)</p>
<h3>China Petroleum Company Explains the Situation of Kerosene Rationing for Public Educators</h3>
<p>The Resources Committee of China Petroleum Company issued the following statement due to rumors that the price of kerosene rationing for public educators in Shanghai was being adjusted. (1) Our company has been rationing kerosene to public educators in installments. This period is scheduled to begin on November 4. Before November 4, no oil payments had been received at all, so there was no need to make up the price. As for the kerosene distributed in the previous period (September), all payments have been collected and the goods have been delivered, so there is no reason to collect the price supplement. (2) The price of kerosene in Shanghai, as previously stipulated by the Executive Yuan, is 5 jiao 6 fen of Jinyuan coupons per kilogram for bulk delivery at the Pudong oil depot. In order to promote domestic products and give preferential treatment to users, our company only calculates it at 90%, and the actual charge is 5 jiao of Jinyuan coupons per kilogram. The price for this period is the same as the price for the previous period, and there is no increase. (3) The cost of Shengshan empty cans has increased sharply in this period, so it has been discussed and decided by major oil companies to make appropriate increases. All companies calculate it at 4 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen of Jinyuan coupons per can, which is not a separate regulation of our company. In fact, this empty can can still be used for other purposes after the kerosene is used up, and its value is even higher than the price set by our company. Therefore, it does not seem that users will suffer losses. And if users think the price of the empty can is too high, they can switch to bulk delivery and bring their own containers to pick it up.</p>

<h3>Scarce Goods in Production Areas Make Procurement Difficult: Rice Market Arrivals Not Robust; Superior White Keng, Bo Dao, and Du Xian Rice All Priced at 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Rice trading has come to a standstill due to the scarcity of arrivals. 969 shi of rice arrived in the South Market, and the Chamber of Commerce decided that superior white Keng, Bo Dao, and Du Xian rice would each be priced at 100 yuan. 100 shi of white Keng rice arrived in the North Market, with medium-grade rice priced at 90 yuan. However, supply is far less than demand, making it difficult for rice shops to purchase, and the shortage of goods in the market is quite severe. The reason for the sluggish arrivals is the scarcity of goods in the production areas, making procurement difficult.</p>
<p>Flour: Price negotiations have not been approved, and the market has no goods for trading, remaining suspended. Under the table, unbranded No. 2 flour is priced at 45 yuan, up another 5 yuan. Retail is experiencing severe shortages. Bran is in short supply and high demand, with prices rising alarmingly, soaring 8 yuan to 43 yuan per large bag.</p>
<p>Grains: Prices are soaring. Soybean arrivals are scarce. Shops on this street are diligently searching for goods. Poyang soybeans are 70 yuan, up another 10 yuan. Corn and red sorghum are being acquired by northern merchants and distilleries, with each rising 6-7 yuan. Tianjin sesame seeds are actively being traded, rising 20%. Raw peanuts surged 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: No goods are available on the market. The 3,100 dan of cooking oil supplied by the factory yesterday is scheduled for payment today, so it was temporarily suspended yesterday. However, due to high raw material prices, soybean oil costs more than 300 yuan, making it difficult to supply in large quantities. Soybean cake is being sought after by merchants, rising 8 yuan to 33 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Situation Intensifies</h3>
<p>Money Lenders Request Adjustment of Deposit Interest Rates</p>
<p>Yesterday (4th), the tight credit situation intensified. Underground interest rates soared to 23-25 yuan per thousand yuan for overnight loans, yet it was still difficult to obtain credit. Although money lender deposit interest rates have been increased, they are still five times lower than underground interest rates. It is reported that a request will be submitted to the Gold Control Bureau in the coming days for another increase.</p>
<h3>Gold Control Bureau Inspection: Various Deficient Private Banks</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the past two months, due to the easy credit situation in Shanghai, private banks released a significant amount of funds. However, recently, due to the sudden tightening of credit, the funds released have not been recovered, and some private banks are facing a potential liquidity crisis. To understand the true situation, the Gold Control Bureau dispatched a large number of auditors to various private banks for inspection yesterday. Furthermore, the authorities are closely monitoring the increasing number of remittances from other cities to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Awaiting Price Negotiations</h3>
<p>There was still no market for sugar in the market yesterday. The Chamber of Commerce is waiting for price negotiations and prohibits members from trading within the market. However, due to the partial opening of other commodities, people in the industry are quite active. Although trading is not allowed in the market, the demand outside the market is exceptionally strong. Furthermore, due to the intense competition among citizens to purchase from street retailers during the price-controlled period, many stockpiles have been sold off. Those with multiple orders are eager to replenish their stocks, resulting in demand exceeding supply and chaotic price quotations.</p>
<h3>Second Estimate of National Cotton Production This Year Released</h3>
<p>Approximately 5.3% Lower Than First Estimate</p>
<p>The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Textile Industry Association released the second estimate of national cotton production for the 37th year as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area: 36,933,000 mu, a decrease of 631,000 mu, or approximately 1.67%, compared to the first estimate of 37,564,000 mu this year.</p>
<p>Ginned Cotton Amount: 10,727,000 dan, a decrease of 605,000 dan, or approximately 5.3%, compared to the first estimate of 11,332,000 dan this year.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Rising</h3>
<p>The Artificial Silk Association is temporarily unwilling to resume trading due to the chaotic price quotations for various commodities. Outside the market, traders are quoting prices of 6,000 yuan for 120 Tianqiao Bright New Goods and 6,200 yuan for Dongyang goods.</p>
<p>Raw silk exports are difficult to expand, and foreign firms are mostly observing. D-grade 78 evenness silk is quoted at 7,000 yuan, and premium grade silk is quoted at 6,800 yuan. Nothing was heard of other grades.</p>
<p>Although there is no formal trading in silk fabrics, brokers are quoting very high prices. Huaqiang Dacheng bedding is quoted at 3,200-3,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting permission for private banks to refund the increased capital in cash immediately after the capital verification procedures are completed, so as to facilitate turnover for industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the "National Wholesale Price Index for June 1948" in Item 3, Paragraph B of Article 6 of the "Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks" should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph C, Item 4 of the Supplementary Measures for Reorganizing Finance, and should be calculated based on the "National Wholesale Price Index for the First Half of August 1948" of 445,960,000.</p>
<p>According to the Export-Import Control Committee, as of now, there have been more than 30 applications for importing goods that have already been paid for and ordered from abroad. All of them are requesting to import materials from Appendix II and Appendix III A and Appendix III B, while very few are applying to import production equipment from Appendix I. The committee has approved seven cases, all of which are industrial raw materials. The remaining 20 cases have not been approved due to incomplete documents.</p>
<h3>High Demand from Merchant Traders and Manufacturers: Yarn and Cloth Prices Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation opened cloth as usual, pricing 12-pound 20-count AB extra-fine cloth at 62.5 yuan, limited to (retail dye factories) for purchase, and American cloth 014-17 thread poplin at 4.3 yuan per meter, limited to (retail) for purchase. The cotton cloth market has not yet resumed trading, but trading outside the market is surprisingly brisk. Because cloth shops in various places have depleted their stocks in the buying spree, merchant traders are in high demand. Yesterday, merchants from Hankou and Guangdong were actively searching for goods, and many from northern merchants and along the Beijing-Hangzhou line also came to Shanghai to purchase. Recently, the China Textile Corporation has not distributed much supply in Shanghai, and factories are still restricting the opening of goods due to the inadequate supply of raw materials. Those with goods are observing and selling less, so the market is very strong. It is reported that the asking price for Longtou fine cloth has risen from 140 yuan to 150 yuan, and some people are buying it, but not many transactions are being made. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge is quoted at 155 yuan. Cloth shops on this street have difficulty selling and replenishing stocks because the negotiated price is too far from the asking price, so retail shops are still closed. Also, it is reported that the authorities are still cracking down on illegal price increases in cotton cloth trading outside the market. It is heard that three or four brokers were interfered with at the Leyuan tea party.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is experiencing strong demand from merchants everywhere, but the supply of goods from various yarn mills and yarn merchants is very scarce, leading to a 20-30% increase in the asking price for various yarns. Replicating manufacturers are buying goods immediately upon seeing them. Fine yarn 42-count blue is priced as high as 5,700-5,800 yuan, and there are buyers. 32-count Silver Moon is 4,400 yuan, 20-count Jincheng is 3,400-3,600 yuan, and 71-count Shuangma is 3,600 yuan. The asking price for coarse yarn, 16-count, 12-count, 8-count, large-count, etc., is chaotic and inconsistent.</p>

<h3>Northeast Wind Departs with a Final Flourish: 3-1 Victory Over Zhichao; Impressive Performance by the Visiting Team, Unexpected Defeat for the Allied Forces</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Northeast Wind football team came to Shanghai and tied all three games, drawing with the Railway, Qingbai, and China Aviation teams one after another. Yesterday afternoon, in the fourth game, it departed with a final flourish and finally showed its might, defeating the local powerhouse Zhichao team, a combination of Chinese and Western players, 3-1. In the first half, Northeast Wind took the lead with a score of 2-0. Although yesterday was not a weekend or holiday, the Yiyuan stadium was packed with over 7,000 fans. Northeast Wind's appeal has never waned.</p>
<p>Zhichao was ambitious and determined to win. The forwards included the famous international player "Little Yellow Hair" Robert Stoff and the Soviet players Novgorolov and Grinas, with Tie Funi in the middle and the general Wu Qixiang in the back. Yesterday, the entire team was disconnected. The forwards lacked tacit understanding and did not coordinate with the defenders. It was a disorganized mess, the midfield was disconnected, and Wu Qixiang never played a role. Northeast Wind pinned down the entire team, so the team's vitality was shut down and helpless. Northeast Wind played with increasing energy, especially with the strict defense of the defenders and the stability of the goalkeeper, and finally won. Yesterday's victory, I would say, was won by good defense. It was truly Northeast Wind's first masterpiece.</p>
<p>Zhichao kicked off. After 12 minutes of engagement, Northeast Wind's Chen Dong shot from 20 yards out. Sheng Peter actually caught it and lost it, slipping into the net. Northeast Wind created the first goal record. After another 10 minutes, Tie Funi lost his footing. Guo Hongbin made a solo charge and shot the ball into the Zhichao crossbar and into the net. Northeast Wind scored two consecutive goals, and its momentum was greatly boosted. The first half ended 2-0. At the beginning of the second half, Zhichao was determined to counterattack and took fierce offensive action. The forwards had several brilliant performances, and there were cheers from the stands, but unfortunately, it was a failure, and the offensive became a thing of the past. After 30 minutes, Zhichao's defeat seemed to be a foregone conclusion. At this time, Yu Qiaxing slammed into Chen Qin and committed another penalty. Zhang Jiliang took the penalty kick, and although Sheng Peter patted it, he failed to save it. Northeast Wind scored three straight goals and won. After another seven minutes, Northeast Wind's Wang Chengxian also committed a handball. Grinas kicked the penalty, but it was saved by Yan Chengkuan. Until the last five minutes, due to Yan Chengkuan's rush, Grinas kicked the ball in, and Zhichao was able to save a goal, finishing 3-1 and avoiding a shutout.</p>

<h3>After the Price Limit Was Lifted</h3>
<p>— Lei Ting</p>
<p>The price limit has been lifted and replaced by reasonable adjustments. This change will eliminate the buying sprees of the past half-month and the strange phenomenon of nine out of ten shops being empty. To say nothing else, the tense emotions have been slightly relaxed, and it is not unpleasant to have a clear view.</p>
<p>Is the price limit of August 19th a success or a crime? Let's not talk about that for now. It seems to be of no avail even if we talk about it. However, when I think of adjustments, those of us "private teachers" and other salaried people can't help but feel a little chilled, and the relaxed emotions immediately become tense again.</p>
<p>For the past three years, the term "adjustment" has become a terrifying shadow in the minds of the general public (of course, the rich can be indifferent, and hoarders will regard it as "good news," but these are only a small number of exceptions). Because adjustment is just another name for price increase. Most of the people have become startled birds, so naturally they will be alarmed by everything, and how can we bear to mock their cowardice? Although this time the adjustment has been given a rather pleasing "reasonable" qualification, and the citizens can be less anxious, how many of the past adjustments were not approved by the government before becoming legal procedures? Just think: if it's unreasonable, how can it be "approved"? If it's unreasonable, how can it be "legal"?? However, the survivors who were fortunate enough not to die from the enemy's ravages and the communist bandits' trampling have already been crushed by repeated "reasonable" actions.</p>
<p>The above remarks are not to say that the price limit should not be lifted, nor to say that the buying spree should be allowed to spread, nor to say that adjustments do not need to be reasonable; but to say: how should the authorities make natural price limits replace artificial price limits in this reform? How should the "reason" of reasonable adjustment become the "reason" that the majority of the people seek day and night? In a word, to balance the supply of materials, the price will be limited without being limited; to balance the income and expenditure of the people, even if the price rises, it will not threaten their minimum standard of living. To say it again: manufacturers should produce and sell reasonably, and the people should live reasonably.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not difficult to say it, but it is difficult to do it. It is naturally easy to write two reasonable words. However, living is a right of human beings, and seeking to live is even more a right of human beings. The authorities naturally cannot ignore it or remain indifferent because it is "difficult," nor can they be biased because it is "difficult," because this is an extremely serious social problem.</p>
<p>Based on past experiences in adjusting prices, the cost-of-living index is the only way to balance salaried people. Whether this method will be adopted again is currently unknown. However, even when it was adopted, it was full of flaws. First, it does not keep up with prices. Second, it often unconsciously becomes one of the factors promoting prices. Third, it has a certain range, and this range is too small—for example, public education personnel have the right to enjoy the cost of living index, while "private education personnel" have to wait for half a year, even if your income in the last two months is only enough to drink plain water, no one cares. (This is just an example.) If this time the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel is still "as before," then there is a problem with this "reason."</p>
<p>Writing this, it makes people think of the "heroes" who went on a buying spree. Buying sprees are wrong and illegal; of course, not going on a buying spree is right and lawful. However, once the price is adjusted, even if it is a very reasonable adjustment, the rise is still a fact. When prices rise, isn't it still the "heroes" who went on a buying spree who benefit? Those who follow the right path lose out everywhere and lag behind in everything, while those who do not follow the right path often take advantage of everything; what kind of "reason" is this?</p>
<p>Of course, others can refute you. Because "in the face of extraordinary changes, there must be extraordinary talents." Conversely, those who made fortunes from national disasters, victory fortunes, and "impossible to operate" fortunes in the past were of course extraordinary talents. Even the easiest buying spree requires the conditions of being alert and agile. Accordingly, those of us who have nothing to live on or are about to have nothing to live on, in addition to regretting and being sad, can only blame ourselves for not having a sharp head, a thick face, a cruel heart, or a ruthless hand, and for being a born numb embryo. Thinking this way, it seems very "reasonable."</p>
<p>In this way, "reason" seems to be a thoroughfare that leads in all directions, at least it is today. However, the common people can no longer tolerate the "reason" of the public having their reason and the mothers-in-law having their reason.</p>
<p>I hope that this time the reasonableness is truly reasonable, or at least comparatively reasonable!</p>
<h3>Speaking of Dreams</h3>
<p>— Fei Yu</p>
<p>We often dream at night. There are only two reasons for dreaming: one is "you think of something during the day, you dream of it at night," which means that the dream is the fulfillment of daytime desires, such as a miser dreaming of gold bars, a glutton dreaming of fish and meat, and a lecher dreaming of women. The second is "you feel something at night, so you dream," which means that the dream is an interpretation of the feeling when sleeping, such as feeling stuffy when your hand is pressed against your chest, so you dream of running and panting; such as feeling cold when your body is exposed outside the quilt, so you dream of falling into the water and swimming; such as feeling pain in a certain part of your body, so you dream of fighting and getting injured.</p>
<p>In the past, people thought that dream omens were mysterious and incredible, but they are actually easy to explain. Someone dreamed that a distant relative or friend had died, and the dream came true, so they thought it was "soul travel." In fact, we always suspect that something has happened to him because we haven't heard from him for a long time during the day, so we have such a dream at night. And the reason why this relative or friend didn't send a letter is mostly because they were sick or had an accident. This is a very natural coincidence and there is nothing mysterious about it.</p>
<p>There are also people who dream that thieves broke into the house, and after waking up in shock, they found that they had actually been robbed. This is because we hear the sound of thieves entering the house when we are sleeping, so we guess: "What is this sound? Maybe there are thieves." So we dream of thieves, and it is not surprising to say it clearly.</p>
<p>There is a Chinese folk tale about a person who had a dream while cooking yellow millet. In the dream, he lived a life of wealth and honor, and when he woke up, the yellow millet was not yet cooked. The author knows of a dream that is comparable to it. One night, an American businessman in San Francisco had a strange dream. He dreamed that he had killed someone. After the incident, the police came to arrest him, so he fled to New York by plane. The detectives tracked him down, so he went from New York to Canada, then to Holland, and then to France. He suffered all kinds of hardships along the way, but the detectives were still chasing him closely. Finally, his money ran out, and he was surrounded by detectives in a small hotel. He risked jumping out of the window, fled into a forest, and was exhausted in the forest and finally caught. Then he was escorted back to San Francisco for trial. He was sentenced to death and refused to accept it, so he hired a lawyer to appeal. He appealed three times, but all failed, and finally the death sentence was fixed. On the day of the execution, he was put on the guillotine. At that time, crowds gathered, and he saw his relatives and friends were all there. He knew that death was imminent and was very sad. Just then, the guillotine had struck his neck. He woke up in shock. There was something on his neck, but it was not a knife, but a small coat hanger that had fallen on his neck. When he felt something hitting his neck while sleeping, he thought, "Maybe I'm going to be beheaded." Why would he be beheaded? It must be because he committed a crime, so he fled, chased, and appealed, and everything came into his dream. It takes at least 20-30 minutes for yellow millet to cook, but it takes only a few seconds from the time the coat hanger falls to the time he wakes up in shock. To have such a long dream in such a short period of time can be said to be unique and more strange than the Chinese Yellow Millet Dream.</p>
<h3>East Scale, West Claw</h3>
<p>— Xian Si</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, the German Navy shipyard in Hamburg has been converting German naval mines into "iron lungs" to help patients breathe.</p>
<p>When Hollywood produces snow scene movies, they often use flour instead of snow. From this year on, it has been decided to use other substitutes (such as liquid fire extinguishers in the surplus materials of the navy, which look like snow when sprayed). It is said that this can save 300 tons of flour this year for European aid.</p>
<p>The United States also has inflation after the war. The prices that have risen the most are food, followed by clothing, followed by furniture, and finally rent.</p>
<h3>Local Scenes</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Whenever I feel a void in my life, I want to take a trip back to my hometown, for my hometown will give me warmth and fill my life.</p>
<p>My hometown is on the great plains of Jiangnan. The goose-yellow rice paddies glitter with golden light under the autumn sun, clearly showing signs of a good harvest. However, if you go to the small town, you will see long lines at the rice mills, hear that rice is valuable but unavailable, and see an old woman weeping because she has had nothing to eat for three days…</p>
<p>Suppose you look at it from another angle: more people are visiting Yu Mountain than in previous years, and those who go to Wang Si Restaurant to taste the oil chicken often find themselves without a seat. Cars and the "climbing tiger" (the vine bridge for mountain climbing) never stop coming. The teahouses in the park are full. These scenes, however, show the peace and comfort of my hometown.</p>
<p>But if you look into the various shops in the streets and alleys, the phrase "nine out of ten are empty" is not an exaggeration. Not to mention that daily necessities such as soap and matches are not easy to buy, even blue ink for writing has become scarce.</p>
<p>It is already the time when the new grain is on the market. My hometown is a rice-producing area. It's not that there is no rice, but the hardworking farmers are reluctant to sell the rice casually because they want to exchange a shi of rice for a box of "Gu Ben" brand soap. They really feel that they cannot buy soap even if they have money.</p>
<p>This is a contradictory phenomenon, and it is also the sorrow and fear of the times. This time, when I went to my hometown, my hometown made me feel even more empty.</p>
<h3>On Works About the History of the Great War</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>The Second World War was a catastrophe for mankind. After the war, people were determined to learn from the pain, and all hoped that this war would be the last war for mankind. However, before the bloodstains of the previous war had dried, a third world war was brewing. Whether in Europe or Asia, there are rumors of war everywhere, which is truly a misfortune for mankind. In today's depressed global atmosphere, reading books about the Second World War feels particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>In the American publishing industry, works on the Second World War have been published one after another since the war, and there are already piles of them. Even in China, where publications are scarce, dozens of them have been published. My own book, "History of the Second World War," has even sold 50,000 copies. However, in the British publishing industry, they are rarely seen. Recently, the British Cultural Commission sent a copy of "A Brief History of the Great War," which was recently published by Methuen Publishing House in London. The author, Mr. Falls, is a professor of war history at Oxford University. During the war, he served as a military reporter for the London Times, interviewing military news not only under gunfire but also broadcasting war news to the world on the BBC every day.</p>
<p>The book is only three hundred pages long and sells for fifteen shillings. It is divided into thirty chapters, which concisely and succinctly describe the course of the war. Because the author has sixteen years of experience in studying "war history," he is quite capable of organizing the complicated war history in an orderly manner. Moreover, where it should be detailed, it is particularly detailed; where it should be brief, it is particularly brief; it can be said to be "just right." It is a rare masterpiece in the history of the Great War, and it is suitable for the general public to read, so I earnestly recommend it to readers.</p>
<p>However, this book also has its shortcomings. Precisely because Falls is a specialist in war history, he only sees the progress of the war and only knows the shifts in the battle lines. He neglects the political and economic background, so it does not make any important contribution to scholars who study international politics.</p>
<h3>Four-Character Verse</h3>
<p>— Xia Quchan</p>
<p>The song is not over, the oath is easily cold; I fear hearing the sound of a broken homeland, and again the voice of wealth does not return.</p>
<p>Late at night in the boudoir dream, it is difficult to wake up, difficult to get drunk; how can I bear to control my tears and watch the great event, already a lonely actor for ten years.</p>
<h3>Washing Brook Silk</h3>
<p>A shallow fate matches a jade cup, I force myself to hold it with all my whiteness, and a hidden meaning is known by the small lamp through eye contact.</p>
<p>Holding the silk sleeves again is like a dream, looking closely at the dark eyebrows, it certainly can make poetry, how can there be a time to sober up in the human world.</p>
<h3>Donkey Meat</h3>
<p>In the old capital, where meat is ubiquitous and no meal is without meat, apart from large livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep, there is also a type of "donkey meat," which has always been disdained by those of the middle class. Even those who carry vegetables in the urban core would rather eat pig head meat, sheep offal, and beef tendons than taste donkey meat. Only the laboring people inside and outside the countryside like it a lot, so there has always been this industry, and the business is also prosperous, but it does not enter the "hall of minor elegance" (not to mention the hall of major elegance).</p>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage and high price of pork, beef, and mutton, donkey meat suddenly became a best-seller due to the needs of the times. In the streets and alleys, there are often those who straddle small wooden boxes and shout loudly to sell, or set up stalls in the bustling city. Not only do ordinary people flock to it, but even gentry men and women also patronize, using it to get through the meat shortage. In the past, the price was disproportionate to the three livestock. For example, before the war, pork was priced at three jiao per jin, beef was two jiao, and donkey meat was only twenty copper coins (about four cents). Now, braised donkey meat costs four yuan and eight jiao per jin (gold yuan) – three mao per liang (900,000 yuan in legal tender). (Fresh pork is about one yuan per liang, and braised beef is five or six mao per liang.)</p>
<p>The method of making braised donkey meat is the same as that of beef and mutton, using soy sauce and spices to stew until tender. Its color is reddish-purple, very similar to beef, but the meat is coarser and cannot be passed off as beef (camel meat is similar to beef, and unscrupulous merchants occasionally use it to mix and sell). According to those who buy and eat it, its taste is no less delicious than beef, and it is not as inferior as people generally imagine. It is also said that people in the Northwest like donkey meat. I once saw an old sheng actor in a Qinqiang opera troupe whose stage name was "Donkey Meat Red," which shows a glimpse of the local customs of the West.</p>
<p>Human preferences for meat vary from place to place and also change with the times. For example, "Yan City Slaughtering Dogs" represents the ancient heroes who are generous and sad, but in modern times, dog meat is rarely heard of. Even today in Yan City (Beijing), dog meat is only secretly slaughtered and eaten by some local people with special preferences, which is not as openly traded as donkey meat. During the period of occupation, the Japanese especially liked it and ordered officials of the puppet organization to search and arrest dogs on their behalf. All the stray dogs in the streets and alleys were caught, and even those raised by families, if they happened to go out, often disappeared. As a result, every family was looking for their dogs and complaining to the police station. The police station then ordered each family to buy copper tags and hang them on their dogs' necks for identification. These tags were made and sold by the puppet government, which was another source of income! The Japanese said that eating dog meat is an ancient custom, and that their people value death and love martial arts. It turns out that "bushido" has such a relationship with eating dog meat! Is this also a facet of "Wearing the garments and caps of the Tang world, the rites and music of the Han lord"?</p>
<p>In the novel *Water Margin*, many heroes of Liangshan are big "meat eaters," either eating cooked geese or fat cattle. Nowadays, people mention "chicken and duck" together, but *Water Margin* has chicken and goose but no duck, because at that time "duck" was a derogatory term (like scolding people with "turtle" later), so they avoided using duck and used goose instead, but it was actually duck. As for eating a lot of beef and slaughtering pigs and sheep, that was generally the case for the outlaws and villagers. In the old days, the official government strictly prohibited the private slaughter of plowing cattle because "cattle plow the fields" and are meritorious to agriculture and relied upon by the people for food. And people advised each other not to kill dogs because "dogs guard the night" and are meritorious to the family and loyal to the owner. These two things both have ethical concepts of respecting virtue and repaying kindness between humans and animals, which is different from the Buddhist's universal prohibition of killing.</p>
<p>Guangdong has "Dragon Tiger Feast," which is made with cats and snakes and is an extremely precious grand feast. There are many Cantonese restaurants in the North, but it has never been seen on the menu. Because Northerners mention eating cats and snakes, they are horrified and change color, and even if it were prepared, no one would patronize it. The difference in preferences, the changes between ancient and modern times, and the North and South, is truly "hard to put into words."</p>
