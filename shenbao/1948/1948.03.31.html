<h3>國大首次預備會議　推定臨時主席及秘書長　主席團選舉法討論熱烈</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大第一次預備會議，卅日晨九時三刻舉行，首由籌備委員會秘書長洪蘭友報吿兩點：（一）本日出席代表共一七九八人，已足法定人數，宣布開會。（二）在大會主席團未推定前，本日預備會應推定臨時主席。當由代表于右任提出由胡適担任大會臨時主席，洪蘭友担任臨時秘書長，胡適則提請由于右任担任，最後一致通過本日大會臨時主席由胡適担任。胡氏於十時五十分蒞主席台，首先提出臨時秘書長人選問題，表決結果，于右任所提由洪蘭友担任案通過。各就職位後，胡氏宣布討論事項開始。今日討論事項，規定兩案：（一）大會主席團選舉辦法案。（二）代表席次編定辦法案。首先討論第一案，由洪蘭友宣讀辦法草案全文以後，各代表開始發表意見，自十時十分開始至十二時法定休會時止，計有潘公展，顧毓琇，李仲林，顏少儀等三十五人發言，旋以提送發言條者尙有五十餘人，時間已不及，經主席提出意見，徵求代表同意，即由秘書處將本日業經發表之意見分別整理後，具體歸納成數點，交下次預備會討論。如有人在此整理後之數點意見以外，尙有不同之新意見，再提大會發表，當經一致表示同意。末由主席宣佈本日下午休會，第二次預備會於卅一日晨九時舉行，于右任担</p>
<p>今日討論「主席團選舉辦法草案」，係國大籌備委會根據國民大會組織法第五條擬定者。草案中規定：「（一）主席團主席二十五人，由大會代表就主席團候選人總名單，用無記名速記法選舉之得票最多者當選，票數相同者，以抽籤定之。（二）主席團候選人由各代表產生單位自行選舉，每單位至少一名，代表人數在三十人以下者，選舉候選人一名，三十一人至六十人者二名，六十一人至九十人者三名，九十一人至一百二十人者四名，一百二十一人至一百五十人者五名，一百五十一人以上者六名。每單位有五名以上候選人者，內應有婦女一名，由各單位用無記名速記法選舉之，得票較多者當選（婦女一名單獨計票），構成候選人總名單，被選候選人，不以本單位產生代表爲限，各單位選舉主席團候選人時，由各單位代表中年長者召集。（三）本辦法經國民大會預備會議通過施行」。附表中並列六十個單位應產出之候選人，計一百三十三名，內應有婦女十一人。</p>
<p>臨時主席胡適</p>
<h3>主席團應增名額　俾每一單位均有參加　潘公展意見博得絕大多數贊同</h3>
<p>選舉辦法中規定，主席團主席之人數僅廿五名，各代表對此事爭執甚久，咸認爲按照上次制憲國大代表總額僅二〇二四名，主席團主席即達五十五人，此次大會代表總額已至三〇四五人，較前增加五成，主席幽主席反减至廿五人，於理不合。且因代表產生單位即有四十八個，爲普遍廣泛，可容納各方面意見起見，亦應增加名額，使其達到每一單位均有傳達意見之代表列於主席團。惟有人認爲此項選舉辦法係根據國大組織法所擬定，而國大組織法則係根據憲法第三十四條而訂定，如擬增加主席團主席名額，即必須修改國大組織法，亦無異修改憲法。如不修改憲法，即是違憲，故主張不必增加名額，對於主張增加名額之意見，會塲中同意者較多，贊同後者意見者較少，各代表發言時，對增加名額之多少及產生辦法之硏討等等，亦提出若干意見。代表潘公展當提出三點意見稱：（一）主席團主席人數之規定，必須修改，本席認爲立院制訂之國大組織法過於詳細，應由大會將國大組織法送回立院，將此項人數之規定一句删除，僅列「若干人」即可，大會再討論人數。（二）主席團主席人數本席認爲應按照制憲國大之比例，增加五成，即五十五加廿八，本屆國大應爲八十三人。（三）選舉辦法以六十單位計，每單位一人，其餘，廿三名則由大會採用無記名單記法選舉，如此則各區域及海內外僑胞等單位均有人參加主席團，可收集思廣益之效。潘氏並就國大代表之職糊有所論列，渠認爲立法院對主席團主席人數規定過少，似有認爲此次國大僅負選舉之責，易於處理。其實大會有修改憲法之權，吾人不能謂必不可修改，討論是一回事，通過則爲另一問題也。如修改憲法，則大會將非廿二日可畢，任務繁重，自非廿五人之主席團所可辦理。潘氏之意見，博得絕大多數代表之同意。其後尙有若干代表發言，惟均未超出此數項原則，討論情緒之熱烈，已爲本屆國大必有之盛况開其端。</p>

<h3>主席團選舉的爭辯</h3>
<p>本報特寫—（三月三十日於南京）</p>
<p>來自全國各地的民意代表，今天在憲政實施程序的國民大會裏，開始了他們對民主政治的熟情爭辯。從制憲國大到行憲國大，民意的考驗，一次比一次進步了。</p>
<p>預備會議，只是大會的前奏，僅僅以討論大會主席團選舉辦法及選舉主席人選等爲主題。然而，每一分鐘，每一個過程，幾乎都是値得爭取發揮民意的機會。因此，主席團選舉辦法草案全文共計三條，就費了整整兩小時的辰光，尙未獲得結論。</p>
<p>今天的臨時主席，由態度溫和而又兼有外交家風度的胡適校長担任。胡先生每有一點建議，必再三的問好不好，會塲空氣因此而能在熱烈爭執之中求得平靜進行。選舉辦法中，引起爭執的有三點：第一是主席數額。第二是產生辦法，第三是選舉辦法。說得簡單一點，就是所有提出異議的，都是全部否定原草案，比如主席數額太少，應予增加，產生辦法應該每單位有人代表。選舉辦法在原草案是指明採用無記名逋記法的，提出的意見中，則一致認爲必須無記名單記法，否則將陷於操縱之一途，不民主。而在這若干發言中，某一位代表就首先提出了國大代表的職權任務，應該修改憲法的問題。他的談話是緊接着臨時主席對一位代表所提主席人數應予增加一點所作談話而起。臨時主席是這麼說的：「主席人數是根據於國大組織法經立法院通過的，如果要對人數問題加以修改，是否仍將提立院完成立法程序」？某代表認爲主席人數須增多，依據制憲國大主席團人數五十五人，這次應更增多，爲何反而减少？同時他大聲疾呼「我們要執行我們的職權，我們要修改憲法，這一部憲法的漏洞太多了」。這第一砲，引起若干人的同意。其後，繼續有人附和他的意見，顧毓琇也提出來說，我們必須把他送同立法院，對這一點重予修改。待立院修改送回，我們再行討論。最後是潘公展有系統的發言，具體抨擊有人認爲不必修改組織法的意見，他强調：我們有權決定我們自己的事，而且修改憲法是我們的職權，誰都不能說不許我們修改憲法，不能修改憲法，討論是應該的，通過才是其次的間題。</p>
<p>今天在每一個代表的議事日程公文袋裏，都有着一本民權初步小册子，他吿訴你，當你在會塲裏有任何想做或想說的事，首先注意「法」，一切必須合法。當開會時間在預定節目上是九時，而實際開會時間連至九時三刻時，籌委會秘書長就不得不受到責難，詢問爲何不准時開會，爲何不能注意到工作效率。可是秘書長以及臨時主席的答覆，說是爲了等候出席代表的滿足法定人數。</p>
<p>當發言時行到十一點半鐘的時候，臨時主席爲了要求發言的人陸讀不絕，恐怕時間有限，希望發言節潔。同時又接到另外四五個代表的建議，請求停止發言，提付表決。但主席剛剛轉達了這項意見時，立刻遭到反對，他們幾乎是不守秩序的，大聲疾呼「注意，在國民大會裏，代表各個角落的民意代表需要發表意見時，不應該受任何人的阻止，主席沒有描」。雖經秘書長在旁一再解釋，這只是接受了幾位代表的意見時，但此起彼落的反對聲浪，仍然掩蓋了一切。終於，是多數意見獲勝了。</p>
<p>這些空氣，告訴我們，民意在這裏泛濫着。沒有人能够違抗，能阻止，這一個開始，主席團選舉辦法的爭執，還不過是一個弊端！</p>
<h3>立法院任務終了　至遲四月底前結束事務　惜別聯歡會將定期舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕國大開幕後，新立法院成立期亦在不遠，現立法院長孫科於三十日該院例會討論議案後宣稱：國大會期依預定進程最快可僅需兩週，如一切順利，四月十一日即將閉幕，則遵憲政實施準備程序第六條首届立法院應於國大閉幕後第七日自行集會，新立法院即應於四月十八日正式組織成立，現立院任務即吿終了，故該院至遲四月底前必須結束一切事務，未了例案將於半月內整理，審議，處理完畢。該院定四月十五日開第三五二次例會，如屆時不需再開會，將定期舉行惜別聯歡會。樓桐孫亦報吿由現立院秘書處兼理之新立法院籌備處業務，負責開會準備事項正積極進行，然現自各地來京之新任立委頗多人地生疏者，據國大籌委會秘書長洪關友吿渠，該委會在各地工作人員已無法不兼對新立委服務，故關於來京新立委之招待事宜，雖立委不同於國代有薪俸可領，且在國大會期間及會後，首都住行問題困難萬分，籌備處亦不得不將勉爲其難，盡力略爲照拂，陳顧遠委員以現任立委宣揚民意囊助政府，若干年來忝有勞績，以爲其善後獎酬問題似應顧及，同時並請孫院長各贈照片留念。陳長蘅委員則提出新立委之當選問題應早日確定並公吿，以便登記開會。最後羅鼎，劉盥訓兩委亦分就選政發言，三十日例會逾午乃散。</p>

<h3>社論　美對日政策的歧途</h3>
<p>美國邀集對日和約預備會議擱淺以後，美國扶助日本經濟復與的消息，紛至沓來。最令人注意的，是史特萊克報吿書的發表，和美陸次屈拉普領導的日本調查團在東京宣佈的復興日本計劃。這兩大計劃的內容儘管不同，而减少賠償，揭高工業水凖，和貸軟日本，助其復興，是一致的。看情勢，美國扶助日本經濟復興，以抵制或當做和約的旣成事實，已經成爲旣定的不變的政策了。這是美國對日政策的歧途，爲東方國家帶來了無窮盡的　患。</p>
<p>現在，我們根據各方消息和客觀情勢，對於美國扶助日本經濟復興的各項計劃，予以分析和批評：</p>
<p>第一，提高日本工業水準　日本工業水準的保留問題，是與賠償問題有聯帶關係的。最初有鮑萊的賠償計劃，乃依一九二六—三〇年的日本生活水準，決定日本工業，何者應折充賠償，何者應予保留；鮑萊計劃已經寬恕了日本舫織業和商船。其次是麥帥的折衷案，依一九三〇—三四年的日本工業爲保留標凖，其賠償額約等於鮑萊計劃的百分之六十至六十五。其後又有史特萊克向陸軍部　出的建議，他的工業水準是由一九三〇年考慮到一九五〇年，其賠償額僅等於鮑萊計劃的百分之三十。大年三月一日，陸軍部發表的　「國外事務諮詢協會報吿書」（或稱史特萊克報吿書），主張「除基本戰爭工業外，一切日本生產設備，皆不可移去賠償」。因此主張少賠償，認為賠償是浪費。這計劃的內容，比麥帥折衷案還要寬大，再減麥帥的百分之三十三。</p>
<p>遠東委員會三月十一日討論美國所提的　計劃，應予保留日本每年生產力：銑鐵二百萬噸，　塊三百五十萬噸，鋼板二百六十五萬噸，硫酸三百五十一萬噸，機器工具製品一萬件，鋼珠與軸承價値三千二百五十萬日圓，此外尙允許發電電熱量一百九十萬瓩，商船一百二十四萬總噸和四百五十二萬噸的船舶修理，與夫九百八十萬桶的石油提煉，七百二十九萬桶的石油貯藏。如果照這個工業水準通過，日本將飛躍為遠東第一位工業國家，所以遠東委員會開會時，東方國家　起反對，尤以中國代表的反對爲最堅決。本月廿日美國陸次屈拉普到日本，與麥帥蘆田長談甚久，麥帥大約相當支持這個新計劃，蘆田均除了感謝美國外，並要求美國繼續幫助重建日本，使成爲「亞洲的工廠」。蘆田大約尙不以史特，克報吿書規定的日本生產力爲滿足，所以屈拉普廿六日發表宣言說：「美國認爲將來日本自己之努力，如點示可能。高此水準而不危及和平，亦未始不可增加」。這是什麽話，簡直忘去日本是戰敗國，和波茨坦宣言皇皇條款的規定了。東方國家如不恐懼日本高度工業足以危及和平，應該作有效的反對，幷覓取打開和會的僵局，完成對日和約。東方國家有一信念，卽不反對日本經濟復興，但要反對日本軍國主義的復活！</p>
<p>第二，大量對日信款　日本賠償尙未完全履行，若干工業設備尙未拆除，要有計劃的復興工果，足以造成威脅東方任何國家的情况。片山內閣時車擬的「經濟復興五年計劃」，需要大量資金活潑週轉，美國戚到濃厚的興趣。蘆田均上台，對美爭取援助，曾向盟總請求十億美元的貸款，俾實施五年計劃。依日政府的計劃，如獲該項信用貸款，五年計劃完成後，其工業水凖將恢復一九三〇——三四年之程度，正合麥帥的理想。盟總對於日政府的貸款要求，究竟作何表示，我們不得而知。不過最近幾格車實可以指出，美國已考慮並且安排對日大量貸款了，第一，美國會開會，共和黨參議日易斯蘭提撥一億五千萬週轉基金，供日本。買棉花，皮革，原料之用：第二，美政府近規定以二億七千五百萬元，作日韓琉球復興，大約日本可得一億八千萬，已提國會討論，可望通過施行：第三，據東京消息，日本財政下年度（卽今年七月），美叫予日之借款，七億六千五百萬，其中包括社會救濟費三億七千五百萬，復興費一億八千萬，棉花借款六千萬，貿易週轉一億五千萬。　個消息是日政府的試探，但屈拉普說：美國會正在考慮使日本成爲一亞洲的工廠」之計劃。其中規定　每年撥付之三億至四億元以供日本防止動亂及疾病外，另行立卽撥付一億八千萬以期復興日六經濟。本來，日　政府的試探，是希冀能獲得七億六千五百萬，藉以穩定下年度蘆田內閣的財政基礙，而屈拉普所說的援日計劃，則更雄壯而巨大，無怪蘆出歡天喜地，日本臣民，要舉國如在了。美國人笑，日本人跳，痛哭的自然是，方廣大的人羣，他們又復面臨蘆講橋珍珠港事變的前夕了。</p>
<p>第三，停止廢　經濟獨占計劃　日本資本主義成爲帝國主義，是她的經濟獨占，所以遠東委員會對日基本政策，是要排除日本經　獨占，解散日本財閥和經濟力的集中。遠東委員會年來的努力，曾通過各種計劃交麥帥執行，效果甚少。最近美陸軍部興國務部經過辯論後，已決定放棄遠東委員會文件二三〇號所規定的「廢除日本經濟獨占計劃，」理由是原計劃的執行方法過於激烈。如果這個計劃停止施行，日本經濟獨占將獲復原，財閥不僅不予解散，可能配合美國扶助日本經濟復興政　重作新的佈署。甚至片山內閣通過的排　經濟力集中案，也要由蘆田均修改了。本月廿日蔗田出席　會發表施政演講，說他傾導下的政府，並無　會主義色彩，這說明美國的扶日政策，已將日本政治往後倒退一步。對於日本政治前途，這不是幸運，而是禍害。</p>
<p>以上分析三端，僅就美國扶助日本經濟復興的輪廓而言。美國陸軍部這樣的作法，似乎與國務部的見解，稍有扞格，但今天的美國，仍是戰略決定政略，並非政略決定戰略，對日政策的誤入歧途，將來終有警覺的一天。我們讀一赫爾回憶錄」，深感戰前美國對日估計的錯誤，結果蒙受珍珠港之禍，淸醒開明的赫爾有遠見有韜略，他喚起不了當局和軍部的注意，殷鑒不遠，一部淸新有力的「赫爾回憶錄」，爲何不爲今天美國的政治家戰略家覺察呢！我們對此實在百思不得其解。</p>

<h3>范登堡聲明全文</h3>
<p>（上接一版）「由外交委員會對援華法案之報吿已造成一種吾人並不欲造成之印象，故該報吿已予收回。其中有若干字句並不反映委員會或其主席之意志。此係委員會工作人員依照日常工作之辦法而準備者，並未由委員會或本人加以檢討，惟有關軍事援助之措詞則屬例外。關於此點，委員會希望確切表明吾人關於美國作戰部隊不擬規定任何義務，並如其他一切對外援助然，不擬規定任何超過現行立法範圍之義務。此點對於一切對外援助係屬必需者，良以吾人不能接受無限制之負担故也。</p>

<p>「本人將在參院中明白表示，即本人對於偉大勇敢之蔣主席所作之巨大帝國工作及其人格之正直以及渠在極大之不利中不斷爲民主理想進行領導一點，深表敬意。此外，並將表明本人一向支持並將繼續支持其反抗武裝之中國共產黨，且對其爲自由中國人民爭取之解放而獲得成功，寄以一切之希望與祝禱」。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平卅日電〕華北鋼鐵公司石景山鋼鐵廠二百五十噸之一號煉鐵爐，於本月廿六日零時五十分點火，廿七日下午九時開始出鐵，兩日來經過情形甚爲良好，將於四月一日正式出鐵，惟爲原料所限，每日煉鐵暫以一百五十噸爲標準。按該一號爐爲廿年前修成者，當時正在歐戰結束，鋼鐵價賤，故修成後並未煉鐵，抗戰軍興，故都淪陷後，被日人修整利用，勝利後復經兩年之整修，於一個月前始全部竣工，旋即開始溫爈，該廠爲紀念此　一有歷史意義之工程起見，於開爐時曾請前鐵礦創辦人年心田親臨點火，以資紀念。</p>

<h3>儒將和潛的競選　程潛</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日航訊〕程潛主任參加副總統競選，所顯示給我們的感覺，就是程氏氣派甚大，擁護他，而且爲他助選的陣容很廣。當他從漢口乘輪到京時，他的友好及有關方面，爲他佈置的歡迎塲面，也够熱烈而偉大。</p>
<p>程氏早年參加革命，北伐諸役，無不身歷。到了抗戰時，程氏又是名將，歷任軍職，或統率大軍，或策　戰略沒有閒過一日。程氏這次來京，出席國大之外，就以競選副總統爲大任。在程氏抵京後幾日，除去在記者招待會上見面而外，記者曾作了一次單獨訪問，對於當前局勢及參加副總統競選的問題有所探詢。</p>
<p>程氏對於當前政局是運樣看的：「目前　們在政治軍事上所遭遇到的若干困難，我認爲如在行憲之後，將可一掃而空。這些空氣之掃除，不僅是澄清局勢，面且亦因此可以使一般人民對於政府增加希望與信任。」</p>
<p>關於他個人競選問題的事，他這麼說：在此時期實在應該是戡亂第一；不過，爲了多方面的敦促，眞是又不敢拒絕，但是總認爲不必過事宣傳。程氏對於競選後的成敗，覺得是一切信託於全體國民代表，相信他們必會有最審慣的選擇，個人的成敗，只不過是一個測驗而已。</p>
<p>程氏對於副總統的任務，認爲僅僅是總統的助手，明文旣沒有給他定以職權，自然就應該以輔助大總統爲最大任務。程氏並謙　的說：如果他幸而獲選了，他一定要盡他最大的忠誠，輔助火總統，　　憲法的實行。同時更應以促成三民主義爲一大任務。</p>
<p>程氏是一個革命軍人，一位咤叱　雲的人物，但是只　起程氏的名字，似乎却很少有人能把他文才秉賦與武功相提並論，或是甚至　沒有人能知道程氏竟是一介　將。其實程氏的詩文都値得稱頌，曾著有詩集。在他的詩篇裏，更可以看出他英雄之氣，儒雅之風，這些在他戎機之暇的卓著，眞够使人敬佩！</p>
<p>程氏是湖北人，這次首先擁戴他的，是武漢人士。程氏對於武漢，應該是一個歷史意義的地點。在卅七年前，首義之役，程氏就參加其事。其後兩度回湖北　要職。武漢，是他熟悉的地區。勝利以後，因又任武漢行轅主任職，武漢人士對於程氏更是有深刻的記憶。因此，這次他參加副總統的競選，湖北的力量將是　　他的。再說，兩湖本是一家，湖南自然也是他的天下。其他如軍人方面，　機　他的自　不少。程氏對於問總統的看法最一並不是　，可是他並不是爲了「並不　要　，　　　　任　出　　選；　　　高名，而是因為他也有　　自信：如果總統不　　事時，他是可以担當這份重任而推進國家重大任務的。而且，擁護他參加競選的，自然更深切的這麽信任他。</p>

<h3>美宣布援助朝鮮　南韓美駐軍增至二萬人　美陸次由漢城飛返東京</h3>
<p>〔合衆吐漢城廿九日電〕美陸軍部次長屈拉普抵此已經三日，頃通過美佔領軍司令霍奇將軍之辦理處，處理表談話稱。美國正在爲朝鮮策劃一類似歐洲復興計劃之計劃。渠稱：是項援韓計劃由陸軍部所建議，已得國務院之批准，而提交議會矣。如能得議會之通過，朝鮮即能獲得增加生產所必須之機械與機件以及相當數量之原料。屈拉普稱：朝鮮必須有更多之原料進口，並提高生產水準，以建立健全之經濟而抑止通貨膨賬。渠稱：援助計劃之目的，乃在協助復興而非救濟。渠稱：朝鮮糧食情形已較去年改善多多。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京三十日電〕廿七日自東京出發赴南朝鮮調查之屈拉普美陸軍次長一行，廿九日下午六時三十五分，乘機抵羽田飛機塲，歸還東京。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三十日電〕消息靈通人士三十日晚透露，過去兩週中，美國駐屯朝儲南部之軍隊已增加百分之五十左右。不久以前，美佔領軍人數尙爲一萬三千人，而現在已達二萬人。此消息透露之際，適自漢城傳來消息稱，蘇聯及韓共正在美蘇佔領區間之界綫上建築大規模之戰隊。然此間負責人士稱，此兩項發展之間並無任何關鍵。然同時彼等承認最近數週來，朝鮮政局日益惡化，致美國駐南韓司令霍奇中將屬下軍隊不得不有增援。某一方面稱，陸軍募兵方案缺乏成效，故「霍奇所需要之人數不得不事削减。」按美陸軍本年度要求募兵三萬八千人，而預算中僅規定三萬人，而志願入伍者尙不到此數。此間芳干美國官員對蘇佔領區加强工事一舉，尙不擬就新聞報導而發表其具體之見解。彼等稱，不相信蘇聯採擇該項直接之公開手段，蓋此舉不久將使蘇軍本身不能置身事外。然彼等並不否認，北韓共黨可能奉蘇聯之命令製造邊境事件而向北韓人民宣稱此係南方侵略，進一步促成北韓軍隊之侵犯南部。華府方面最精確之估計爲，蘇聯佔領北韓之軍隊在四萬至四萬五千人間，而其羽翼下之韓共人數約爲十五萬至二士萬人。然一般更以爲，建築戰壕一舉不過爲心理姿態，藉以向北韓人民表示南方美軍將展開攻勢，而使韓人更形擁護共產傀偶政府。同時，此間官員仍以爲韓共邀請金九等南韓右派人士於四月十四日赴平壤共商組織全韓政府之舉，「乃一烟幕，目的在淆亂視聽，或藉以使聯合國所主持之南韓五月九日大選喪失信用用。」此間相信右派人士北韓之行，對彼等有益，蓋經此考驗，彼等恐將放棄一切與北方共黨獲致協議之希望矣。</p>
<h3>北韓人民挖掘壕塹砲位　由蘇軍從旁督工　工事集中南北韓交通必經之處</h3>
<p>〔聯合社朝鮮北緯三十八度美軍第十八號前哨崗位廿九日電〕蘇軍與朝鮮北部村民已在美蘇佔領區分區綫附近挖掘塹壕，狐穴及砲位，原因不明。據北部來客談稱，蘇聯曾向北韓人民宣傳美軍與南韓人民企圖進攻北緯，此次下令建築防綫蓋欲證明其確實。此項工事最先係由美軍哨乒在本月初發覺，當時尙以為灌溉農田之水溝，三月九日左右工作加劇，性質逐漸明瞭，並有容納一二人之狐穴出現。</p>
<p>戰壕深六呎，並有深二呎半之通訊壕加以聯接。狐穴直徑十呎，上設砲座，可容八十一毫米口徑之美國式臼砲。據報，工事集中於南北交通必經之山谷五處。戰壕控制每一山谷之公路與該區鐵路。截至昨日止，北緯三十八度沿綫共計發現戰壕逾三十二處，各長三十呎至五十呎，嗣後日有新戰壕三四處陸續發現。初見於西端，旋向東移，昆鄰分界，距美軍佔領區不過一箭之地。美軍佔領區並無活動，僅界南數千碼若干村落警察局外安置沙袋，規模不大。蘇軍佔領區工事大半係朝鮮民人在蘇軍監督下建築，蘇軍偶亦動手參加挖掘。村民出發工作，常唱歌搖旗，整隊而行，每排兩三人。有時夜間掘壕，白畫則以樹枝掩蔽，最近甚至公然出現，不避美軍哨兵耳目。哨兵今日在界南百碼以內利用望遠鏡觀察，瞥見約二千碼外山陽有韓人三四十名，均穿白衣，並肩而立，開始掘壕，壕長約五十碼，輪班休息，蘇兵一二人在旁督工。截至下午，壕已甚深，蘇兵偶然離開，韓人工作即大爲懈怠。該山以西有一大山，上掘三壕，顯已竣工，高下相疊，俯臨公路，貼對美軍哨站。邊境村落兩座最近全體北遷，聞係挖壕者妨害其日常生活與農事所致。</p>
<h3>朝鮮委會決議　南韓準時選舉</h3>
<p>霍奇曾提出展延要求</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城卅日電〕聯合國刺鮮委員會卅日以四票對三票，一票棄權通過朝鮮於五月九日舉行普選，雖則事前韓南美軍總司令霍奇中將及朝鮮選舉委員會要求展期至五月廿四日舉行普選。霍奇中將及選舉委員會稱：屆時遠區之投票無法及時舉行。聯合國委員會稱：若美國及朝鮮當局努力進行，此項困難當能克服。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約卅日廣播：華盛頓訊，今日第三黨總統候選人華萊士出席參院軍役委員會作證，發表長篇言論，對杜魯門總統要求實施普遍軍訓一節，力予抨擊，聲稱杜魯門政府故意製造虛僞之危機，使美國人民走向戰爭</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕前總統顧閒巴魯轍在參院軍事委員會前作證，促立即實施軍事動員，並輔以工業及經濟動員，使普遍軍訓得於被置於堅固備戰基礎的最高峯。渠指出美國之義務，需要勸員適當的軍力，俾使對外之經濟援助不致妄用，並使美國之言論產生力量。爲防止戰爭，需要在危機發生前充實軍力，吾人決不能再允美國之缺乏準備，鼓勵他人之對美或對其他和平國家發動侵略。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕瑞士電台報吿，前芬蘭總統孟納興元帥，今日抵瑞士巴斯勒，轉赴洛卡諾療養。</p>
<h3>美議員再度攻擊　馬歇爾外交　要求撤職讓賢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕明尼蘇達州衆議員奈特遜廿九日重提其馬歇爾應立即撤職之要求。渠稱，如吾人欲避免戰爭，馬歇爾之撤職係勝必要。由於危急情勢目前存在於全世界，美國外交事務應操於有訓練右手腕外交家之手，實有必要。根據其多次外交失敗之紀錄，全不信馬歇爾具有該項資格。渠稱，渠特別不滿意於馬歇爾在華外交使命，去年四强莫斯科會議，及對巴勒斯坦問題大轉變等之結果。</p>
<h3>西班牙列入馬歇爾計畫　美眾院業已核准　援外法案討論順利進行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣播：華盛頓訊，衆院今日以一百四十九票對五十二票，通過邀請弗朗哥西班牙參加六十二億零五百萬美元之對外援助計劃。衆院外委會已同意將西班牙包括在內。但衆議員伏里斯稱，國務院反對此舉。至於參院是否將通過辦法，乃另一問題。總之，茍西班牙欲參加一歐洲復興計劃，則必須如其他參加國家然，恪守合作與自助之原則。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日電〕六十二億五百萬元併合援外法案，今已渡過第一次重大難關，蓋衆院已拒絕接受另一規定，以五億元直接救濟海外需援國家之代替性議案。衆議員葛溫意圖擊敗外委會之政策，特提出該代替性之法案，作爲一項修正案。該建議雖獲得其他衆議員支持，然終未獲通過。民主黨衆議員塞勒再度反對併合援外法案，包括軍事援助中希土部份。渠並斥該法案爲卑鄙之政治手段。若干孤立派衆議員於最後片刻，猶力圖阻止衆院對併合援外案佔壓倒優勢之同情，渠等斥該法案爲「飾以羊皮之豺狼」。彼等並抨擊國務院及其他並不相關之問題。衆院外委會令。通過建議中之修正案，授予援外法案執行人以否決商務部長所頒發之出口許可證之權力。該修正案事實上將授予法案執行人權力，以停止任何渠認爲對美國安全有重大影響之出口。外委會並將規定以二億二千萬元援助日本，朝鮮，琉球經濟復興之另一修正案予以擱置。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕參院方面定於星期四討論經濟軍事援華案，該院對於援歐經濟復興及軍事援助希土案已通過另案辦理。國會領袖希望各種援外法案，能於本星期杪提交參衆兩院聯合會調整，俾擬成一折衷法案，趕在四月十八日義普選前提交杜魯門總統簽署。</p>
<h3>傳莫洛托夫抵柏林　並與蘇軍司令秘密會談</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦三十日電〕英工黨機關報「每日前鋒」今日刋載其柏林特派員消息稱，蘇外長莫洛托夫業於昨晚抵柏林，並與其紅軍司令舉行秘密會議，討論德國政府中之四强危機。該報特派員進而指出蘇聯人員平日極易用電話聯絡，惟昨晚則保持緘默，極濃厚之秘密氣氛籠罩蘇軍總部。據該特派員稱，此次秘密會談之目的，似在打開四國間之僵局，並保全四國管制機構。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿九日電〕此間盛傳蘇外長莫洛托夫已抵柏林，但尙無法加以證實。同時原應於週二（三十日）舉行之四强盟管會會議至本日下午頒發召開通知之期限截止以後，尙未由蘇聯通知召開。蘇聯爲三月份內輪値盟管會主席，故應由其召開，四月份將由美國輪値主席。</p>

<h3>弗朗哥演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬德里三十日電〕本日爲弗朗哥佔領馬德里第九週紀念日，弗氏向長槍會員四千五百人演說，同時廣播全國。弗氏對西班牙之未能列入美援歐計劃表示遺憾，並預言終有一日，西班牙及西方民主國家「將在同一戰壕內駢肩作戰」。渠稱，世界反共戰爭中，西班牙較西歐早十年即已負起責任。由於他國忽視西班牙內戰之敎訓，致「歐洲十二個國家目前喘息於蘇聯之重壓下」。渠稱若干國家一擬分化吾人」及阻止西班牙與他國間之合作，實屬遺憾。</p>

<p>〔聯合社成功湖三十日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦委員會三十夜一致議決從速在巴勒斯坦成立一猶太臨時政府，已於致猶太公會政治部長休托克函中通知此事。據委員會稱，按照去年十一月廿九日聯合國大會議決案，應採取一切可能之步驟，執行巴勒斯坦分治除非安全理事會另有命令，委員會將依此進行。先是據美代表團發言人宣布，美國首席代表奧斯汀卅一日將在安全理事會呼籲巴勒斯坦停戰，委員會之決議，距美代表團發表此訊後僅數小時。</p>
<h3>美軍事秘密會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三十日電〕軍長六人今日抵此，將與陸軍參謀總長勃奮特萊舉行秘密會議，爲期四日，此在勃氏繼艾帥就任以來尙屬初次。</p>
<h3>美海軍訂購　新戰鬥機五十架</h3>

<h3>我代表出席四委員會　討論各新聞專題　英代表提出更詳盡國際草約</h3>
<p>〔中央社日內瓦廿九日專電〕聯合國新聞自由會議此二日來，除掌管大會行政工作之統籌委會舉行會議外，其他四委員會亦分別討論各項問題。我代表團出席各委員會之代表名單如次：（一）首席代表張彭春，出席統籌委會；（二）程滄波出席研究報紙基本任務，其他報道工具，新聞自由原則，及其他一般問題之第一委員會；（三）鄧友德出席研究國際新聞收集及發佈問題之第二委員會；（四）劉豁軒出席研究自由發佈及收取新聞問題之第三委員會；（五）馬星野出席研究法律及起草會章問題之第四委員會。我出席第三委員會代表劉豁軒，在該會今日討論廢除檢查制時稱：中國自大戰結東後，即廢除新聞檢查制，民主實爲中國文明之一部份，中國人民享有言論及出版之自由。劉氏並稱，吾人反對任何方式之檢查制，但如需新聞自由後，需新聞界本身負責任，允應有道德。</p>
<h3>杜魯門主義進一步驟　美計劃軍事援歐　軍事租借法有恢復可能</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕恢復對英及西歐聯盟他國之軍事租借辦法，已成此間官員及報紙之討論題目。馬歇爾國務卿於上週拒絕評論此事，但曰，法國政府曾一再請美國供給配備。此間若干人士認爲軍事租借辦法，乃實施杜魯門主義之下一階段。杜魯門主義之第一階段爲去年三月之開始採取援助希土行動；第二階段爲馬歇爾方案之提出；第三階段爲西歐聯盟成立；第四階段爲美國之恢復征兵及重整軍備；第五階段將爲以武器供給西歐國家，以塡補因缺乏配備而造成的眞空。</p>
<p>報界之揣測目前均集中於對法軍事援助，法陸軍雖有六十五萬人，然武器配備俱感缺乏。然法大使館人士則謂，在西歐聯盟諸國有機會實行其軍事同盟之細則以前，軍事援助尙屬言之過早。另一未證實之報吿，則謂美國防部已有擴大英皇家空軍之計劃，擬助以美國最新式飛機，使成歐洲最堅强之防禦力。</p>
<p>〔聯合社日內瓦廿九日電〕美國報業公會會長馬丁今日在聯合國新聞自由會議白宮致蘇聯之新聞管制原文，該條文長達千字，將全部報紙期刋，攝影，無綫電廣播，演講，展覽會與影片統歸人民敎育部長全而節制。馬氏讀畢稱，一國政府出以如此嚴厲，澈底與華斷的管制，鮮有資格批評任何人民的自由報紙。蘇聯代表羅馬金反唇相識，指責美國報紙企圖在國外散佈猥褻文字，此種文字引起美國本身青年罪犯之浪潮。英國代表委克尼爾會議訂立國際條約，確保基本人權與新聞自由，英國之草案較美國上星期提出者更爲詳盡。</p>
<p>〔路透社日內瓦三十日電〕蘇代表駐法大使沾谷莫洛夫今日在國際新聞自由大會中指責在盎格羅薩克遜國家內有極强力的美元與英鎊新聞檢查制存在，係由捚有並控制報紙之巨頭行使此等檢查權。波氏此言係為答覆英代表麥克居爾昨在會中之言論。麥氏昨曾指出蘇聯報紙與西方民主國報紙之基本不同點，乃爲西方民主國家寗賢冒被人批評其政策之危險，而不願採取限制或壓制之手段。至於蘇聯及斯拉夫國則適相反，不願被報紙批評，而肆意採取壓制政策。</p>

<h3>蘇聯的猶太政策</h3>
<p>— 中央社時派員　王公達</p>
<p>〔中央社安加拉航訊〕當今世界政治的最大謎語之一，而爲兩半球人士所日夕玩味揣測的，是「爲什麽蘇聯支持分割巴勒斯坦」？</p>
<p>美蘇二强共同支持巴勒斯坦的分治，成了一九四七年聯合國大會上的天字第一號的奇蹟，美蘇二强在每一件事，每一個原則，每一個問題，都處在恰恰相反的地位，惟有對於分割巴勒斯坦這一個題目上，美蘇二强意見始終完全一致。</p>
<p>美國贊助分割巴勒斯坦關係固然重大，然而美國國內有大羣的猶太富翁，他們的經濟力量直達到美國的國會，他們的政治力量直接影響到一九四八年的美國大選。美政府看透了阿拉伯世界七個小國的軟弱無能，於是硬着頭皮決定支持分割巴基斯坦。（按美現已改變立塲，主張由聯合國暫時托管。）</p>
<p>蘇聯忽然出來決定了支持巴勒斯坦分治，是初非世人始料所及的事，因為三十年來的蘇聯歷史有很多事情，指明蘇聯不會支持這一計劃，理由是這樣的：</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯一面認爲猶太人的復國運動者，即世所著稱的「輯安主義」者，是英帝國主義的走狗。分割巴勒斯坦是直接促成猶太人「輯安運動者」的歷史的努力之實現。</p>
<p>（二）戰後三年來，蘇聯爲了經略中東，不惜化了鉅大的金錢與人力，拼命講求與阿拉伯人交好，蘇聯爲什麽以區區巴勒斯坦一小地之分割間題，來開罪於擁有七個獨立國的四千萬阿拉伯人呢？</p>
<p>據記者觀察，可以判定蘇聯的決定，是捨遠求近，實事求是，是擒賊先擒王的戰略，蘇聯的決定是具有深刻奧妙，但仍可揣度的道理。</p>
<p>蘇聯三年來對阿拉伯世界的所有宣傳，都未能收到預期的效果，阿拉伯人一千三百年來深信回敎，回敎與布爾希維兄主義根本不能相容，幷且阿拉攸世界裏七個獨立國中，除了兩個最小了是共和國之外，其餘有立憲君主國三，專制君主國二，換句話說，阿拉伯世界中的權力還都集中在少數的統漢階層手中。統治階層對蘇聯視若毒蛇猛獸，蘇聯便休想在這一方面有所進展。</p>
<p>阿拉伯的老百姓，除了以信奉回敎爲唯一精神上的寄托外，還有牟數以上是游牧民族，他們旣不住城市，又不讀書，旣不看報，更不聽廣播，蘇聯的宣傳對於他們可謂亳無影響</p>
<p>蘇聯在失望之餘，便想到了無孔不入，無事不會，與無業不捷足先登的猶太人。將來的「猶太國」顯然的會在建國以後，先以經濟征服中東，再以政治衝破中東千年的酣睡，終以武力成爲中東的巨覇。蘇聯決定以猶太國爲階梯，以猶太人爲前驅以攫取中東，這正是「擒賊先擒王」的戰略。</p>
<p>有一個事實可以證明聖地猶太人的進步，而爲莫斯科的擴張主義者所器重。遠在四十年前（一九零八年）當列寗亡命於瑞士，在瑞京開辦「花火報」，自爲主筆，一方研究馬克斯主義，一方鼓吹無產階級革命的時候，巴勒斯坦的猶太人，便成立了有史以來的第一個「集團農塲」。</p>
<p>記者與中東專家討論的結果，認定了聖地的「猶太國」將來會成爲蘇聯宣傳與擴張的「最良導體」。如此蘇聯決定背棄了三十年來的理論（認輯安主義者爲英帝國主義的爪牙）支特分治，以產生「猶太國」實貝有歷史的必然性。</p>
<p>蘇聯準備以亞受培强民族分崩伊朗，以亞美尼亞及庫爾迪民推進有土耳其，以維吾爾民族分崩新疆，以蒙苦民族及中國共匪分崩中國，現在以平行的同樣政策，以猶太民族來對付「頑固」的阿拉伯民族。</p>
<p>三十年來蘇聯得意的使用了一個利用弱小民族以圖擴大領土的政策，自東亞經中亞，直至波羅的海，都是採取同樣步驟。記者暫名之爲「種族的蠶蝕政策」，並就敎於國內的學者，如何給這侵略史上的最新典型起一個名字，英美學者對這蠶蝕的典型還未暇綜合觀察</p>
<p>蘇聯於一九二八年創劃「猶太自治區」，一九三四年改爲「猶太自治省」，二次戰前省內之猶人只十一萬人，戰期前往逃雞者達十萬人，故目前省中猶太人口不過二十餘萬人，等於蘇聯全境猶太人口百分之四，其餘蘇境猶太人仍居住東歐自波羅的海至黑海之平原與「黑土帶」中。</p>
<p>蘇境猶太人做父母的都知道夷迪史文的無用，當然不熟心讓小孩子學這無用死的古代東歐土話，猶太人又是歷史造成的功利主義者，俄境的猶太人無一不講俄文，那是因爲怕坐牢，猶太敎早都置之高閣，猶太民族固有過節禮樂也同歸於盡，於是在血統上，文化上，俄境的猶太人已全被同化。（完）</p>

<p>加斯貝利强調聲明「吾人不願布爾雪維古化，吾人祗願民主化，沒有和平不能使我國家經濟復興，因此我們需要和平。」述及托格里亞蒂所羅將不惜代價爭取勝利之語時，加斯貝利指出在蘇聯制度統治的國家內，托氏之語即係表示將使主義不同的其他選民，付出鮮血的代價。加氏並重述敎宗昨日演說時所用「四月十八之投票，非爲對於政府的信任票，而爲對於良心的信任票」之語。並曰在四月十八日之錯誤，將使今後兩三代的子孫飲恨不已。</p>

<h3>錫滬路上汽車墮河　席德柄眷屬　遊春演慘劇</h3>
<p>全車男女七人傷亡　卡車上押車員見義勇為　蹤身入水救活母女倆</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕錫滬公路上，前日有遊春汽車傾蘿，傷亡七人之慘劇，已誌昨日本報。茲悉該失事車輛係本市四區麵粉集公會理事長兼阜豐麵粉廠總經理席德柄之弟，前紗布銀行總經理席季明所有。席德柄爲本市實集界鉅子，曾任中央造幣廠廠長。復興商業公司總經理等職。前日（廿九日）因適値休假，特偕其夫人及夫人之長女歐陽美生，壻陸鴻鈞，幼女席與韵，席季明夫婦，曁四川畜產公司總經理古耕處等，分乘自備汽軍三輛，沿錫滬公路赴常熟遊覽。上午十一時許抵達太倉縣屬雙鳳鎭車塲橋，該處橋身峻陡，橋面狹仄，兩堍傾斜度頗高。當時古及其家屬所乘車居首，業已駛過。正値第二部席季明之車開上橋坡之際，迎面適有江蘇省復耕隊一〇三一〇號卡車，自鎭江裝運空油筒來滬，同時駛登橋面，因彼此速率頗高，卡車雖及時煞住，席季明之車則以閃避過，撞斷橋東側南段欄杆，翻身墮落河浜中。湍流滐急，瞬間即告滅頂。斯時席德柄所乘之第三部車距離較遠，在卡車上押車之復耕隊技術員趙孝芳見狀，即躍身下河，摸開車門，將席德柄夫人及其女歐陽美生救出，先送太倉公醫院施行急救，迄昨已脫險境。席季明經救出時，已面色發靑，因急救後未見好轉，乃又車送來滬醫治，終因救治不及而吿殞命。其餘在車內之司機周奚福，席季明妻孫鳳蘭，陸鴻鈞，及席與韵四人，則以施救人手過少，撈起後均已氣絕。屍體昨經太倉地院勘驗，即將運滬殯殮，卡車司機許成玉亦由該院扣押偵訊。</p>
<p>據當時目擊之鄉民談：出事之汽車在墮河一瞬間，駕駛者似爲一西服靑年，司機則坐於其身旁。嗣在撈救時，發覺手扶方向盤者爲陸鴻鈞。陸最近方自美返國，結婚亦尙未滿兩年，不料竟演此慘劇。渠等所乘者爲史蒂別克一九四七年式新車，翻落河中後，車輪猶在轉動，橋側欄杆之木片深入引擎中，現該車已內阜豐自滬派員會同當地警局設法起出，惟已破壞不堪。又聞席季明及其妥孫鳳蘭本不擬去常熟遊春，嗣因車輛空位尙多，乃欣然命駕，不岡竟遽逢變故。</p>

<h3>民調會檢討　本月配米工作　收回米款數逾萬億　頓使市面銀根抽緊　四月份米油配價今日決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市四月份配米價格，定於今日下午五時在市府吳市長辦公室中。由吳市長，行政院處理援華救濟物資委員會代表潘光迴，糧食部代表葉實夫等組成之三人小組委員會作最後之決定，明日登報公告。</p>
<p>上海市民食調配會，昨日下午四時，在市府會議室舉行第十二次會議，出席吳開先，張曉崧·葉實夫·邵永生，水祥雲等十餘人，由市民食調配會主任委員任顯羣主席，對本月份配米工作，作周密之檢討，並決定下月配米改進方針，任主委特於會後招待記者，報吿會議內容如下：（一）民食調配會對於本月份自由市塲米價之上洛，均有正確之記錄，俾供下月份新配價決定時之參攷。據統計結果，上白粳之平均價目爲三·四二四·六一五元，碾過爲三·〇〇〇·五〇〇元，糙米爲二·四七四·六六七元，上中下三種食米之平均價格應爲二·九六六·五九四元。惟下月份記價之決定，並非完全依據本月份之平均價格爲標準，三人小組委員會將參酌市塲情形，及經濟條件而法定之。</p>
<p>十六萬人·放棄權利</p>
<p>（二）檢討三月份配米工作結果，迄昨日爲止，該會發出配米證計大口四·四一八·〇〇〇張，小口六一四·〇〇〇張，收回者二六四·〇〇九張，計實發者爲四·七六七·九九一張。此數亦即表示該會三月份應供應之食米爲四十七萬餘担之數。實際上該會本月份陸鐵分發至各區之食米總數達五六四·〇九四祖，（內逢糧米及緬甸米四〇五·六九四担，糧食郁供應之過米一五八·四〇〇担）。至本月廿六日截止期爲止，共計售出四六〇·六五八担二斗，故現尙存米一〇三·四三五担八斗。上項數字表示本市有十六萬餘人領得配米證後放棄權利，佔全市總人口數之百分三强。</p>
<p>收款愈多·暗息愈高　（三）本月份國家銀行收回配米款額總數爲一·〇五〇·三〇〇·八五七·四四〇元，民調會根據一月來之經驗，證實配米款額之收入，與市塲暗息關係密切，收款愈多，暗息愈高。根據本月份統計：自三月八日收款達五千億元起，暗息即開始上眺，至三月廿五日收款達九千億元時，暗息竟超出三角。故民調會希望市民下月份起，能提早於月初購米，則國家銀行能早日獲得米款，抽緊銀根，俾收抑平物價之效。</p>
<p>米店最多·推蓬萊區　（四）本市各區米店分佈情形各有不同，據調查結果，以蓬萊區米店最多，新市街區米店最少，黃浦區因房租高貴，人口多而米店少，平均每家米店需供售六，五二九人，而斯盛區每米店僅需供售八六九人，致釀成若千米店購米擁擠現象·該會爲謀改善起見，決自下月份起，依據供售之比例，決定配米之多寡，俾避免擁擠現象。（五）四月份配米，該會業已陸續送出，至今日爲止，全市二十九區皆可送達，僅餘新涇區或將於明日送到。</p>
<p>未解米款·查有八家　（六）三月份米款迄朱解國家銀行之米店，查有八家，計：眞如區達豐米號，北站區華興順米號，北四川終永升米號，江灣區沈祥泰米號，靜安區源泰興米號，洋涇區茂泰鳳記米號，全福泰米號，常熟區大隆鐘記米號，上項米店，自四月份起先行停止配米，涂案函請金融管理局查明責任，移送法院辦理之。</p>
<p>計口授油·定十二兩　此外，會類之決議事項如下：（一）戶口配米承辦單位（包括米業，社會服務處，合作社）聽候市社會局核議。（二）第二期職業工人配米配售限期，依規定期限，展期十天，至四月十二日截止，並登報公吿。（三）第三期產業工人配售煤球，依照二月份配米人數核配，如已向市社會局申請變更登記各產業單位，中社會局兩知本會辦理。</p>
<p>關於計口配售食油，決自四月份起參照配售食米各項成規辦理之。不論大小，每人一律決定爲十二兩，由市民自動選擇油店往購，配油價格，亦於今日下午五時，與配米價格同時決定之。其四月份油款未繳清者，四月份停止配油。</p>
<h3>四月份配美國米　每斗十五斤十兩</h3>
<p>據悉：四月份中全市將配售美國救濟米，每市石計重一百五十六市斤，即每市斗計重十五市斤又十市兩，較上月份重十市兩。至學生四月份食米配價當局仍擬維持每市石八十萬元，以示優待。</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（四）一九四四年的怪現象</p>
<p>假如獎國的政策於對日戰爭期間達到了它在中國的顯著目標，則現在就沒有帮助中國以抵抗共產生義的問題了。中國將早已共產化了。</p>
<p>我並不是說這是我們在中國的直所爲而爲的目的，但是我誠懇地相信這將是邏輯上必然的結果。</p>
<p>在我們對華軍事聯盟這三年中美國所實施的政策，其主要之點就是增加對中國中央政府的要求，而於一九四四年達到了最高峯，簡直有使這個政府讓位的意思。</p>
<p>同時，我國政策的執行者又不斷和中國叛亂和自治的共產黨進行着一種「公開的調情」，希望用美國武器來武裝他們，並且帶他們到國民政府中國地區來和日本人作戰，——而那時候，中國國軍司令毫不缺乏人力，却正在要求美國軍器和築彈。</p>
<p>並且有一個消息說，共產黨曾表示願意把共軍的市接指揮權交給我們的戰地司令史迪威將軍。這個消息，並不在我官方職務的範圍之內獲得，但是是可靠的。假如共產黨確已提供過這樣一個辦法，那麽我對於它的終極秘密目的毫無懷疑，那無非是要在國民政府中國地區攫取權力。</p>
<p>這是一九四四年九月在蔣委員長拒絕美國最後與最大的要求迫使美國召回史迪威之前的不幸情形。在近乎有三年的時間中，史迪威曾不斷堅決要求中國軍隊完全由美國軍官團管理，直到上校的階級。</p>
<p>據我所知所信，除了史迪威企圖經由緬甸打開一條陸上交通綫的强烈希望之外，這個設想極佳的計劃，乃是史迪威及其屬員所發動的長期策劃的一個良好實例。</p>
<p>關於美國在華軍事策劃的失敗或者缺乏策劃，以及美國的要求所引起的危機，我們以後再會講到。目前，讓我們來考慮美國重慶司令部和中國共產黨之間發生的所謂「公開調情」的現象。</p>
<p>一九四四年及其前所謂中國西北邊區共產黨「邊區」首都延安在重慶設立一個代表團，作爲和抗日中央政府合作的一種表面掩飾。實際上，這個代表團除了是一個刺探消息機關和宣傳中心之外，極少其他意義。</p>
<p>直至對日勝利日之後，美國策劃者開始利用這個機關來進行以中國共產黨併入中央政府爲目的的談判。其前，共產黨代表團的主要任務，似乎是新聞聯絡工作。報界對於「獨裁的」中央政府攻擊，其大部份材料係來自共產黨駐重慶代表團，這雖未公開發表過，但是是一個富有諷刺意味的註解。</p>
<p>除了這個離奇的辦法之外，美國的戰地參謀部後來又另外加上一個——那就是在延安成立一個美國軍事代表團。對於此一行動唯一可能的辯護，就是在一個本身顯然缺乏軍事情報的地區供給軍事情報。</p>
<p>但是美國駐延安代表團實不止以提供情報爲限。它使共產黨便於獲悉我們的軍事措施，並使美國記者以及留駐我國在華戰地參謀部的國務院人員不時可以到延安去跑一趙，以宣揚共產黨的主張。</p>
<p>在重慶戰地司令部與延安之間，旣有空中交通的便利，所以任何人要到共產黨這個展覽地區去旅行一次，是相當容易找到一個適當的藉口的。已往中國政府一向不贊成這種非官方的接觸的，尤以新聞記者的接觸爲甚，可是那時候簡直極少辦法可以加以干涉了。</p>
<p>假如美國駐延安代表團的確是有價値情報的一個來源的話，這種情報實在缺少機密性。假如這種情報的機密性係屬需要的話，我覺得實際與需要之間存在着一條鴻溝。</p>
<p>一個軍官向我報吿說，他有一次到重慶記者招待所去的時候，獲悉共產黨相當「喜歡」史迪威來領導他們的軍隊。假如這個報吿是正確的話，對於如此微妙的事情竟不能保守機密一點，不免令人驚奇，其程度，初不下於這個情報本身。</p>
<p>假如要辯證美國駐延安代表團的確提供情報上的便利的話，那麽史迪威的繼任人魏德邁認爲這一機關並不需要這一事實，乃是一個針鋒相對的反駁。我懷懷疑這個代表團的意義不止以更多的壓力加諸蔣委員長爲限，雖然該代表團及其協同培植起來的親共反蔣說法對於十足共產黨以協助與安慰一點，乃是不成問題的。</p>
<p>當時重慶流傳着一種戲言，就是美國司令部參謀部正在擬訂「一個私下的外交政策，由約翰·戴維斯（國務院派駐史迪威司令部的幕僚）作爲國務卿」。</p>
<p>一九四四年間，美國在重慶政策的另一不健全論調，見諸於有關美國大使館人員傑克·塞維斯以及其他人士的案件之種種流言，此輩人士曾被控以重要機密文件傳給共產黨同情者。塞維斯後來被宣吿無罪。</p>
<p>但在這件事情發生之前，史迪威參謀部的一個較低級人員，曾說過對塞維斯的控吿，乃是在製造「第二陶爾麥斯事件」。他預料塞維斯的辯護就是在確立一種論據，就是他不過按照史迪威的政策對重慶政府實施「舊有的壓力」而已。</p>
<h3>中國滑雪部隊　在襁褓中</h3>
<p>〔本報迪化廿四日航訊〕中原各地已是桃紅柳綠的季節了，然而來自貝加爾湖畔的高壓寒流，却更使銀裝玉砌的北部新疆，又平添了多少春雪，多麼美麗的潮海春雪啊！就在這春雪飛無的（時候，是三月七日的上午，迪化第五軍官官訓練班所訓練的第二期滑雪幹部三百餘人又畢業了。</p>
<p>六週滑雪訓練　這一期是今年元月二十八日開學的，一共訓練了六個星期，第一期是在去年十一月二十四日開始，今年元月十二日畢業的，前後畢業的滑雪幹部共有七百一十餘人，畢業後就成爲北疆和河西走廊駐防部隊中的中下級軍官。</p>
<p>在六個星期訓練之中，他們要知道些雪地與極寒地作戰的知識，他們必須學會滑雪的種種技行，什麽「直滑降」「斜滑降」「山地滑行」「越野滑行」「雪犂式滑行」啦，還有什麽「仆跌」「障碍超越」以及「雪橇行軍」啦，至於雪地裏各種巡邏製擊的方式，以及滑行時各稱射擊破壞的伎倆，都必須在這六個星期之中奠定下基礎，他們不但會而且技術已很熟絲，回到各部隊即可以訓練部下，據悉駐防北塔山上的國軍，已有很多的士兵在學着滑行了。因此我們可以說迪化軍官訓練班是中國滑雪幹部的搖籃，新中國的滑雪部隊將從襁褓中日漸長成起來。</p>
<p>不但新疆，乃至全中國，過去都沒有過滑雪部隊的存在，雖然在日本强佔東北的時候辦過滑雪請諫，勝利以後政府也雖然在繼續辦理，但並沒有怎樣的擴充，也沒有好大的規模，所以在新疆辦理滑雪訓練，可以說完全無成規可循，一切均賴自己創造。</p>
<p>價格器材教材　據記者所知，比間主持這滑雪訓練的人眞是煞費苦心。各種滑雪用具原來沒有成品，也沒有專門製造這種工具的工人，於是他們就只好就地取材，利用過去曾經修理過雪板的工人，照着圖案依樣製造，在極短的時期內，「滑板」「撑桿」「雪橇」等各種工具，居然也够一期四百多人訓練滑行之用了，其次是敎官問題，國防部既然無人可派，內地亦無這種專家可聘，於是也只好就地選些個溜冰的人或者過去學過滑雪的人（在寒帶地方滑雪溜冰繼爲一般國民所愛好的冬季裏的姊妹運動），再參照書本去研究，去學習，去改正，以速成的方法解決了敎官問題。而此所謂書本，中國當然是沒有的，靠僅有幾）本外文參考書，要求切合新疆的環境，予以編譯研究，然後印發，現在如「雪地與極寒地作戰」「滑雪部隊之訓練」「滑雪之部隊使用」以及「寒地作戰以及訓練」等書，受訓的滑雪幹部也差不多可以人手一册了。</p>
<p>有一次記者去看負訓練實際責任的易瑾將軍——軍官訓練班副主任——他就具體地指出，辦理滑雪訓練的困難是三材問題——人材，器材，敎材，也是最難解決而必須解決的問題。而這些主觀的客觀的困難問題，他們本着黃埔精神終於克服了，自己滑通了這條路！</p>
<p>伐木製造工具　現在是快到春暖雪消的時候了，一俟冬季到來乃至以後每年的冬季，將繼續辦理，以後規模將更要擴大，訓練將更有進步，是無疑義的。據悉：刻正採伐南山之木，由此間兵工廠加工製造滑雪工具，以備本年冬季訓練及分發各部隊應用。爲什麼蔣主席要手令此間軍校辦理滑雪訓練呢？我們很常識的就可以意識到這種理由：在北緯四十三度以北的新疆，冬季長達四五月之久，晝夜溫度相差十至十五度之大，寒氣凜冽，猶憶三十三年冬季，國軍初入新疆，碰上從未曾有之奇寒，以致好多士兵「半死於砲火，半斃於道旁」，這是活生生的歷中敎訓；而且爲加强大陸寒代的國防綫，爲求克復積雪逾三十公分步騎乃至裝甲坦克不能運動時的行軍困難，長白山麓與興安嶺一帶雖然具備着訓練滑雪部隊的自然條件，但現在却仍然是烽火終天，因此，天山與阿爾泰之間，那就是自然的訓練滑雪部隊的最佳塲所了。</p>
<p>雪岡演習成績　是一個風雪交加的日子，第一期滑雪訓練班曾有一次演習，此間各軍事首長都應邀前往參觀，記者也趕去飽了一次眼福，看一個個的國防健兒，都不約而同的讚美着。全疆的軍事長官也是軍官訓練班的主任宋希濂將軍，他更不時的露出了滿意的微笑。</p>
<p>演習地點是在雪岡的側坡上，第一個課目是「直滑降」，直滑降爲山地下降方法的一種，遇到山地側坡迅速運動最基本的方法。緊接着「斜滑降」「山地轉灣」「障碍超越」「持槍負物之直滑降」「持槍負物之仆跌」等一個個技術表演，愈來愈覺得精彩了，更緊張的是：「碰」的一聲，滑降射擊表演又開始了，這是滑雪學員在腕帶着「撑桿」，兩手持槍，彈上腔，瞄準射擊，退彈壳，這還是在二三十度斜坡上穿着「滑雪板」滑降啊！「拍！拍！」又演習輕機槍滑降射擊了。雖然只有假設的敗人，而情形却眞够緊張，我的心已「撲！撲！」的跳動起來！據說第二期訓練的幹部技術尤爲進步，能獨脚滑行，越野滑行五十多分鐘能滑行八公里多哩！</p>
<p>宋希濂將軍爲了提高幹部學習滑雪的興趣，有一次也去雪原上試着滑雪，不幸摔了一交，把左膀摔脫了節，醫了半個多月才好，這次雖給宋將軍以肉體上痛苦，但它更給了雪野上的國防健兒以無上的激勵！</p>
<p>兩次滑雪戰史　我參觀演習後踏上了歸途，我在歸途上默默地想，我耽思於滑雪溜冰的姊妹運動，我神志飛舞願我男兒都縱身於雪地原野，我想起了現在是北極時代，大家向北走的時候，我們國脉所繫的大陸邊張就在寒帶，我油然記起了兩個滑雪戰史：</p>
<p>在第一次大戰的時候，德國打法國，本來是想南打瑞士北從比利時兩將進攻的，後來德皇到瑞士遊歷，看見瑞士國民溜冰滑雪，運動神速，而德國根本還沒有這種訓練，所以德國就放棄了從瑞士打法國的計劃。</p>
<p>一九三九年十一月三十日·蘇軍開始進攻芬蘭的乃卡里連伊斯馬土，芬軍舖成了「冬天的道路」，利用滑雪部隊隨時襲擊蘇軍，至一月中旬，戰爭便結束了，蘇軍總共死亡三萬六千之多，所有給養，全被芬軍捕獲，而芬軍參戰人員不過兩千，死亡總數不過百五十人而已，這是滑雪部隊所建的奇功。（梅然）</p>

<h3>文物舊書毛筆</h3>
<p>— 朱自清</p>
<p>這幾個月北平的報紙上除了戰事，殺人案，敎育危機，等等消息以外，舊書的危機也是一個熱鬧的新聞題目。此外，北平的文物，主要的是古建築，一向受人重視，政府設了一個北平文物整理委員會，並且撥過幾回不算少的款項來修理這些文物。二月初這個委員會還開了一次會議，決定爲適應北平這個陪都的百年大計，請求政府「核發本年上半年經費」，並「加强管理使用文物建築，以維護古蹟」。至於毛筆，多少年前敎育部就規定學生作國文以及用國文回答考試題目，都得用毛筆。但是事實上學生用毛筆的時候很少，尤其是在大都市裏。這個問題現在似乎還是懸案。在筆者看來，文物，舊書，毛筆，正是一套，都是些遺產，歷史，舊文化。主張保存這些東西的人，不免都帶些「思古之幽情」，一方面更不免多多少少有些「保存國粹」的意思。「保存國粹」現在好像已經成了一句壞話，等於「抱殘守闕」，「食古不化」，「迷戀骸骨」，「讓死的拉住活的」。筆者也知道今天主張保存這些舊東西的人大多數是些五四時代的人物，不至於再有這種頑固的思想並且筆者自己也多多少少分有他們的情感，自問也還不至於頑固到那地步。不過細心分析這種主張的理由，除了「思古之幽情」以外，似乎還只能說是「保存國粹」；因爲這些東西是我們先民的優良的成績，所以才値得保存，也才會引起我們的思念。我們跟老輩不同的，應該是保存只是保存而止，讓這些東西像化石一樣，不再妄想它們復活起來。應該過去的總是要過去的，我們明白這個道理。</p>
<p>關於撥用鉅款修理和油漆北平的古建築，有一家報紙上會經有過微詞，好像說在這個戰亂和飢餓的時代，不該忙着辦這些事來粉飾太平。本來呢，若是眞太平的話，這一番修飾也許還可以招攬些外國遊客，得些外匯來使用。現在這年頭，那輝煌的景象却只是戰亂和飢餓的現實的一個强烈的對比，强烈的諷刺，的確呌人有些觸目驚心。這自然是功利的看法，可是這年頭無衣無食的人太多了，功利的看法也是自然的。不過話說回來，現在公家用錢，並沒有什麼通盤的計劃，這筆錢不用在這兒，大槪也不會用在那些無衣無食的人的身上，並且也許還會用在一些不相干的事上去。那麽，用來保存古物就也還不算壞。若是眞能通盤計劃，分別輕重，這種事大概是該緩辦的。筆者雖然也贊成保存古物，卻並無搶救的意思。照道理衣食足再來保存古物不算晚；萬一晚了也只好遺憾，衣食總是根本。筆者不同意過分的强調保存古物，過分的强調北平這個文化城，但是「加强管理使用文物建築，以維護古蹟」，並不川多花錢，卻是對的。</p>
<p>舊書的危機指的是木版書，特別是大部頭的。一年來舊書業大不景氣，有些舖子將大部頭的太版書論斤的賣出去造還魂紙。這自然很可惜，並且有點兒慘。因此有此讀書人出來呼籲搶救。現在敎育部已經撥了十億元收買這種舊書，搶救已經開始，自然很好。但是筆者要指出舊書的危機四伏已經很久，並非突如其來。清末就通行石印本的古書，携帶便利，價錢公道。這實在是舊書的危機一開始。但是當時石印本是不登大雅之堂的；說是錯字多，固然，主要的還在缺少那古色古香。因此大人先生不屬照顧。不過究竟公道，便利，又不佔書架的地位，一般讀書人，尤其靑年却是樂意買的。民國以來又有了影印書，大部頭的如四部叢刊，底本差不多都是善本，影印不至於有錯字，也不缺少古色古香。這個影響舊書的買賣就更大。後來四部叢刋又有縮印本，古氣雖然較少，便利却又加多。還有排印本的古書，如四部備要，萬有文庫等，也是万便公道。又如國學基本叢書，照有些石印本辦法，書中點了句，方便更大。抗戰前又有所謂「一折八扣書」，排印的錯誤並不太多，極便宜，大量流通，靑年學生照顧的不少。比照抗戰期中的土紙本，這種一折八扣書現在已經成了好版了。現在的靑年學生往往寗願要這種排印本，不要木刻本；他們要方便，不在乎那古色古香。買大部書的人旣然可以買影印本或排印本，買單部書的人更多樂意買排印木或石印本，藝術的革新就注定了齊書的沒落的運命！將來顯微影片本的書發達了，現在的影印本排印本大書也會沒落的罷？</p>
<p>至於毛筆，命運似乎更壤。跟一水筆」相比，它的不便更其顯然。用毛筆就得用硯臺和墨，至少得用墨盒或墨船（上海有這東西，形如小船，不知呌什麽名字，用墨膏，裝在牙膏似的筒子裏，用時擠出），總不如水筆方便，又不能將筆掛在襟上或括在袋裏。更重要的，毛筆寫字比水筆慢得多，這是毛筆的致命傷。說到價錢，毛筆連上附觸品，再算上用的時期的短，並不見得比水筆便宜好多。好的舶來水筆自然很貴，但是好的毛筆也不賤，最近有人在北平戴月軒就看到定價一千多萬元的筆。自然，水筆需要外匯，就是本國做的，材料也得從外國買來，毛筆却是國產；但是我們得努力讓水筆也變成國產才好。至於渦去敎育部規定學生用毛筆，似乎只着眼在「保存國悴」或「本位文化」上；學生可並不理會這一套，用水筆的反而越來越多。現代生活需要水筆，勢有必至，理有固然，「本位文化」的空名還是抵擋不住的。毛筆應該保存，讓少數的書畫家去保存就够了，勉强大家都來用，是行不通的。至於現在學生寫的字不好，那是沒有認眞訓練的原故，跟不用毛筆無關。學生的字，淸楚整齊就算好，用水筆和毛筆都一樣。</p>
<p>學生不愛講究寫字，也不愛謂古文古書——雖然有購買排印本古書的，可是並不太多。他們的功課多，事情忙，不能够領略書法國的藝術，甚至迎寫字的作用都忽略了，只圖快，寫得不淸不楚的呌人認不眞。古文古書因爲文字難，不好懂他們也覺着不値得費那麼多工夫去讀。根本上還是由於他們不重視歷史和舊文化。這也是必經的過程，我們無須驚嘆。不過我們得讓靑年人寫字做到淸楚整齊的地步，滿足寫字的基本作用，一方面得努力好好的編出些言文對照詳細註解的古書，讓靑年人讀。歷史和舊文化，我們應該批判的接受，作爲創迭新文化的素材的一部，一筆抹煞是不對的。其實靑年人也並非眞的一筆抹煞古文古書，只看古文觀止已經有了八種言文對照本，唐詩三百首已經有了三種（雖然只各有一種比較好），就知道這種書的需要還是很大——而買主大概還是靑年人多。所以我們應該知道努力的方向。至於書法的藝術和古文古書的專門研究，留給有興趣的少數人好了，這種人大學或獨立學院裏是應該培養的。</p>
<p>連帶着想到了國書和平劇的改良，這兩種工作現在都有人在努力。日前一位靑年同事和我談到這兩個問題，他覺得國畫和平劇都已經有了充分的發展，成了定型，用不着改良，也無從改良；勉强去改良，恐怕只會出現一些不今不古不新不碍的東西，結果未必良好。他覺得民門藝術本來幼稚，沒有得着發展，我們倒也許可以促進它們的發展，像國畫和平劇已經到了最高峯，是該下降，該過去的時候了，拉着它們恐怕是終於吃力不討好的。照筆者的意見，我們的新文化新藝術的創造，得批判的採取舊文化舊藝術，士大夫的和民間的都用得着，外國的也用得着，但是得以這個時代和這個國家爲主。改良恐怕不免讓舊時代拉着，走不遠，也許壓根兒走不動也未可知。還是另起爐竈的好，舊料却可以選擇了用。應該過去的總是要過去的。</p>

<h3>怎樣使人尊敬？</h3>
<p>— 周和</p>
<p>為第七屆師範教育運動週作</p>
<p>今日的敎師，要同公務員平等地位，來保障待遇，要加收進修費或尊師金，來維持生活，如果向家長多收了幾個錢，那末學校就被稱爲學店，說是違法，因爲商人是可以任意漲價的，做敎師便必得「奉公守法」，所以近年的師範學校，即使免收學費，津貼膳食，前往投考的還是不多，就是願意去投考的，大半都是女生，師道不尊，一至於此，這究竟是爲了什麽理由，我的看法，大概有三：</p>
<p>師道不尊　第一，因爲現在的敎師，只要有些學問，便可做了。試就上海的情形而言，國民敎師有半數以上未受師資訓練的，通常普通的中學畢業生，只要服務一年，就可合格，於是做官去職，做敎師；經商失敗，做敎師。做敎師旣然如此容易，你也可做，我也可做，便不再受人重視了。</p>
<p>第二，我要說到現在的師範敎育。一般想來，師範學校的畢業生，敎學一定很好。可是事實上却是不然。普通的敎師這樣敎，師範畢業的敎師，也是這樣敎，甚至在中學裏，凡是敎育學系畢業的敎師，大多學無專長，除了行政以外，做敎師是不行的。這樣一來，敎師的地位，更是沒落，不受尊敬，概可想見。</p>
<p>第三，再有近年以來，讀書一道，早不受人注意，兒女從小學到大學，十六年間，不知要化掉多少錢才得畢業，就是畢了業，也不一定有辦法，倒不如趁早變計，敎兒女改習了商業，開開店舖，做做生意，經濟情形却可以改善些。因此學校的敎師，在家長看來是無關輕重的。倘使眞的要兒女讀些書，那可把敎師請到家裏去，好在費用很少，只是比僕役稍多一些。</p>
<p>不是教書　而是教人　由是可知，師道的不尊，確是有理的。我們要勸人尊師，一定要大家情情願願的尊敬敎師。最好辦法，要他們覺得敎師同食米一樣，不可缺少，兒女的敎育，必須要仰賴敎師，才有希望，因此我們如果做了敎師，決不能再照傳統的觀念做了。一般敎師的工作，只是敎書，不論學生的性別有男女，身體有健弱，智慧有高低，一概不管，所以人人會敎。現在我們要廢止敎科書，廢止千篇一律的教科書，以人爲對象來敎學，於是每個人都可依靠自己的才能，各自發展。這樣就非有敎師，非有師範畢業的敎師不可了。其次，現在敎人的方法，也要改變。過去教書，只要有着學問，做到材料豐富，講解精詳，便算好了。現在敎人，要敎人自己學習，所以應該把學習變做一種活動。在學習活動中，敎師是處於指導的地位，等於會議的主席，旅行的領路者一樣。所以一個優良的敎師，要有兒童的新觀念，知道兒童是怎樣學習的，才能勝任，這樣敎學的結果，一定很好，做家長的便樂於送兒女入學校了。敎師的地位，自然增高。最後，我們知道古代教育的中心，全在家庭，家庭中的父母，同保姆律師法官敎師一樣。自從產業革命以後，家庭的組織改變，女子也到社會上去找尋職業，於是兒女一定要送到學校，學校就替代了家庭，變做敎育的中心。敎師的責任，除了學問，還要指導着職業婚姻等各項問題。理所當然，可是我們對於現代的學校是失望了。現代學校中的敎師，除了學業，他都不問。這樣得到的學業，就變做了人生的裝飾，有可以，沒有也可以。如果不然，有那個家長，會不願把兒女託付敎師呢？因爲我說的敎師，是整天和兒童生活的，對於兒童各項問題的指導，都是專家。</p>
<p>試想，現代敎師的工作，不再敎書而是敎人了。受敎的人，確是眞正的獲得學習，這種學習，完全解決了人生上的各項問題。這些問題，任何家長，都照顧不到的。只有學校，只有學校中的敎師，才能担任。那末，家長豈有不敬敎師，敎師在社會上，豈有不會增高地位的道理呢？</p>
<p>現在我們要提倡師範敎育，便應該好好的指導師範生，從此做起。</p>
<h3>周達雲聯珠妙射　青白反敗勝阿倫泰</h3>
<p>美海軍三七比四三受挫　上半時青白落後十二分</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍阿倫泰籃球隊昨晚七時再度出師，對靑白於市體育館，上半時廿二比十，客軍不可一世，安知靑白否極泰來，竟以四十三比三十七反敗爲勝，上半時靑白十比二十二分落後。球沐千餘人，皆大歡喜。靑白周達雲之投籃，一再妙中，最爲觀衆矚目，此公論功應居第一，阿倫泰石福勒愛特生兩人，仍極活躍，靑白在第三節方見超出，末節順流而下，客軍無能爲力矣。</p>
<p>阿倫泰稱雄一時　七時開賽，阿倫泰石福勒打破空氣，靑白周達雲速中二球領前，從此即屬客軍世界，阿倫泰陣容，除石外，爲愛特生，黑格林，愛倫，史旦恩，原班人馬，靑白爲周及徐亨，馬燦希，蔡演雄，陳祥龍五人。第一節十分鐘戰成八比五，迨第二節續職，靑白曾二次暫停，可謂不景氣之表示，陳淸江一度易出祥龍，張少卿代達雲，形勢依然難敵，上半時爲廿二比十，阿倫泰稱雄一時。</p>
<p>青白隊否極泰來　第三節達雲重作馮婦，接觸之下，即行左右開弓，徐亨演雄均有似醒獅，而達雲投籃的得心應手，居然以廿九比廿八超出，阿倫泰以柯拉斯換出黑格林，交替方畢，本節結束。末節靑白的聲勢和球運，都有逢勃氣象，對方克羅復替石福勒，靑白經各個努力，乃一路領前，周蔡二人的投籃有時竟有意想不到的收獲。客軍石氏再入戰，仍無濟於事，四十三比三十七，靑白後來居上，致勝有術。</p>

<h3>華北長跑一傑　介紹劉景琨　青島的冠軍正在苦練中　希望在全運會一露頭角</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島航訊〕日本有長跑十傑，如今日中國論長跑十傑，華北劉景琨當爲其中之一。但就記者管見，劉景琨在今日長跑人才中，已在前三名之列，今年全運得分無問題。若假以機緣，與樓文敖將成中國長跑雙璧。</p>
<p>劉君在長距離選手中早露頭角，以生活艱困，日愁柴米油鹽，絕不以選手為職業。刻服務於靑年軍二〇八師第九團，並無超級營養，同時因職務及環境關係，缺乏科學訓練，但來日希望甚大，記者故特作短文介紹之。</p>
<p>劉君籍山東濰縣，就讓靑島，今年廿七歲，身高一米七〇，體重五十六公。中學時代，八百米成績即有二分六秒七，一千五百米亦有四分二十幾秒成績。去秋靑島中美運動會中，成績爲四分廿一秒，與第二名相距一百幾十米，故成績未可滿意。去年在北平運動會中，萬米跑二十四分十秒，與第二名相距數圈之多，同樣不能滿意。數年前，劉君五千米成績爲十六分廿五秒。某次運動會中，不習於百度以上高氣溫，老將工正林得第一，成績在十七分以上，亦覺扼腕。</p>
<p>三十五年秋，劉君在靑島跑萬米，成績卅三分十五秒，破全國紀錄，此時樓文敖君在上海跑卅三分四十餘秒，以後迭見新成績，今日已創卅一分廿七秒最高紀錄，進步誠極神速。而劉君練習迄無規則，靑島無適當運動塲可供練習，因此也沒有準確紀錄，刻離全運開幕之期已近，此時劉君遂成爲各方被拉的對象，頗感爲難，由此足見做一個純粹的業餘選手之不易。日前靑市舉行八千餘公尺越野賽，劉君一路領先，游刃有餘，而取第一。姿勢奇佳，允爲天賦之才。今日劉君來訪記者於寓所，表示決定參加全遝，並從記者之勸，將事務料理後，即開始練習，正式練習須在中午，俾適應五月中上海的燠熟氣候。他希望獲得一個苦練一月的進程表，希望國內體育界先進帮助他。（愼之）</p>

<h3>加强控制金融市塲　短期庫券即將發行　月息規定五分國行正塗裝備一切</h3>
<p>短期　劵之發行，中央銀行已在積極準備中，一俟財政部公佈條例後，約於二週內即可正式發行。據悉；該項庫劵總額並無規定，係田中央銀行視需要情形隨時發行，期限約分一個月·二個月·三個月三種，月息五分，將按票面九折發行，各銀行錢莊及人民均可購買，並可作担保及抵押品。</p>
<p>庫劵發行之重大意義，在調劑需要，吸收游資。過去吸收游資，大都　拋售物資，今後央行復可運用庫劵，隨時隨地緊縮銀根，故在加强控制金融市塲方面，無異又增加一支生力軍。</p>
<p>又訊：政府發行短期國庫券，　務會議已於上週正式通過。此項國庫券　爲一千萬·五千萬·一億·五億·十億五種，期限爲一個月二一個月·三個月三種，利息爲月息五分，係委託中央銀行視實際需要，按折扣隨時在公開市塲發行，發行之多少，亦　需要而定，中央銀行已作充分之準備，一俟命令到達後，立即發行。國家行局商業行莊，及各階層人民，均可購買，並可在市塲以抵用方式自由流通。　此次庫券之發行，全爲控制市塲，抽緊銀根，達成吸收　資之目的。過去政府美金庫券之發行，黃金之拋售，雖可吸收游資，但所付代價極大，目前不能再蹈覆轍，特改採高利政策，發行短期國庫劵，於公開市塲出售，增加中央銀行控制市塲之工具。因隨時可發行，且銀根吿緊可减發，銀根鬆濫則增發，擬收回法幣兩千僮或三千億，即發行兩千億或三千億之庫劵，對控制市塲居於主動地位，非如公債屬於被動。原定利息爲月息五分，與市塲利息相去甚遠，特按折扣發行，其折扣之數，即增加其利息。在日前之情况下，所付代價不大，實較合算，某經濟權成，認爲中央銀行有此工具，確可　收　資，達成控制市塲，抽緊銀根之目的。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行息：到期美金庫劵本息，決按當日　央銀行外匯牌價，圻合支付國幣。外傳或將以將近發行之短期國庫券抵付一說，並非事實。</p>
<h3>華股展開跌風　小型疲莫能興</h3>

<h3>茶市堅穩</h3>
<p>查紅綠茶花色，自產存趨涸後，執主售意咸不稍鬆，一市上供應遂更凋零，但喊價則　站雲宵，而買戶雖因國內外去化均佳，惟感於目前一時不能隨心所欲，態度暫取觀望。全日過程，供求漸稀，做開交易缺乏特色市勢　鮮起仆。價格方面，多與上週相仿。</p>
<h3>肥皂疲軟</h3>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，因銀根仍緊，暗息奇昂，買戶進提乏力，且與外埠行情倒懸，客胃派頓，反有回籠貨拋售，市上籌碼充裕，廠盤雖提高，本街同業絕鮮採納，人心萎靡，喊價高後即挫。</p>
<p>迨至近收，固本皂比假前（廿七日）下挫十一萬元，以五百七十四萬低價收市，其餘黃祥茂光華等，亦都軋低十萬元左右。</p>

<p>昨日捲菸市况，初開喊價即見軟弱，塲內交易淸稀，門莊添購亦少。又以月底關係，各方頭寸帶緊，浮多了售　衆，並有漢口等地同行拋賣，同業間轉吐亦夥。更傳美匯掛低之說，人心一蹶不振，賣風展開，步步下瀉。　最後十支大英低至九千九百五十萬元收市，比之假前（廿七日）狂瀉三百五十萬元。老刀烟亦軋降二百五十萬，爲七千九百萬元結束。其餘華商條烟，以銀行白蘭地雙斧白馬等牌去化較健，市呈挺秀。此外各牌大都軋跌自一千至一萬五千元不一，美烟及聽裝烟互有升降。</p>

<h3>產地報跌人心不振　食米麺粉均下游　油餠雜糧市勢力一致萎靡</h3>
<p>米市下游，因隔日無錫報跌，人心不振，晨開貨主仍喊原盤，惟乏人問津。終因本街胃呆，去化狹隘，市難立足，貨主不得不抑價以招顧主。南北二市塲均較上週收市降十萬元，白粳南市塲三百五十萬，北市塲三百六十萬，南港米來貨較多，下跌較鉅，早薄稻各降十五萬之譜。民食調配會在北塲售早稻，價三百三十萬，購者不多，南市未售出。</p>
<p>麵粉在米價報跌聲中，亦見激降，更以蘇錫價疲，執主心虛，相繼吐售，北帮少有問津，本街零化亦呆，開市即見降落，中市最軟，收市稍形轉昂，各牌俱小六七萬元。兵船粉以一百四十二萬五千開市，一度低至一百四十一萬五千，收市仍回升至開市之價。紅蜂·建成·均小六萬餘元，前者已進入一百四十萬關內，大包麩皮猛降四五萬。</p>
<p>雜糧參差，然疲者居多，黃豆初開甚呆，價勉强立足，後汕頭帮略取，高貨挺二三萬，杜豆降四五萬，苞米靑島帮雖取而不多，降六七萬元，揀靑乏銷，挫四五萬。菉豆紅糧交少市疲，赤豆平定，生仁受廣帮之染指，先漲四五十萬，後市以上漲過多，即轉疲象，終升三四十萬。</p>
<p>食油因米價及其他雜糧均跌，市勢萎軟，况無錫等地價小，人心均虛，本街鮮有添辦，貨主以求售不易，紛紛自動抑價，油廠開價亦低。大統豆油以七百四十五萬開出，收市小至七百三十五萬，同豐豆油更小至七百三十萬收市，各降十五萬至二十萬。生油到貨多，價猛跌，靑島吉桶生油以八百七十五萬收市，在降四十萬元。生蔴油亦狂落四十萬，生菜油淸油均小二十萬，豆餅客帮不取，降二三萬元。</p>

<p>自備外匯進口物資當局處理事務關將竣事，其中有各項紙張約達六七千噸，內係加拿大及瑞典白報紙佔十分之九，連日各紙商紛紛向當局趕辦　購手　，一俟辦妥，即可供應市需，故昨市美貨白紙報行情，比假前（廿七日）每令猛跌廿萬元，低見四百六十五萬元收市。對開紙每令亦狂跌十五萬元。其餘西白有光，及打字紙，這林紙，牛皮紙等，亦均慘瀉自十萬至五六十萬之鉅。</p>
<h3>人造絲挫降　廠經軟·綢貨跌</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市挫降，一二〇號旭字有光，開盤價爲一億九千四百萬元，供求尙平，一度高至二億元賣價，中午收盤爲一億九千七百萬元即期價，下午曾降至九千萬元賣出價，結果最後行情爲九千一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市微軟，D字等級單子貨做開價三億〇八百萬元，C字等級五擔拆貨成交價三億一千萬元，高零擔三億〇五百萬元均有交易。千經殊乏成交，喊價亦稍疲軟。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市下跌，華强眞絲被面開市行情爲一億二千萬元，旋聞股市報跌，人心　軟，喊價頻頻低落，迄收市降至一億一千四百五十萬元即期價。大誠格子璧縐成交極少，收市行情爲四十四萬元，其他各貨，廠盤大都朱更，市價均稍軟弱。</p>
<h3>利空消息頻傳　棉紗布一致下瀉　紡建售布申購單較前減少</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因假前上漲過多，又屆三底，市上銀根未鬆，客胃轉懈，本街呆鈍，四十二支藍鳳細紗自二億元關開獲後，比假前即挫七百萬。嗣以塲內謠傳外匯有掛低之可能，人心更形虛怯，又爲業外物品普跌，多頭競相吐售，空頭乘機活動，紛起拋售，市勢頓呈供過於求，行情慘瀉至一億八千七百萬元。</p>
<p>迨至近收時，因有散空抵補，重叩一億九千萬關收盤，較之假前（廿七日）回跌一千七百萬元。二十一支雙馬紗拋賣較多，低至一億一千四百萬收市，慘跌二千萬之鉅。其餘二十支十六支及卅二支等粗細紗，亦均回降一成左右不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開時即有利空消息頻傳，人心渙散，又以外匯基準價有掛低之說，浮多競吐，同業出籠，本街對准購單稍有套進，僅山西帮微有吸納，市勢疲憊無神。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開四百卅二萬元，逐步下瀉至四百廿三萬元低價，染廠乘低略有進取，復又微升至四百卅萬元收市。比之假前（廿七日）回跌十萬元。其餘各細布亦均回降自十萬至十五萬元，惟收後市氣仍疲，龍頭細布四百廿五萬元有成交，准購單竟倒貼五萬元，爲四百二十萬間有賈出。</p>
<p>此外雙飛龍細布，初爲三百七十五萬，最後以三百八十五萬元收束。四君子嗶嘰及直貢細斜色布士林布等，互有榮辱。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡建公司昨循例開布，共售出棉布三〇四〇疋，被單一〇〇條，申購單較前减少，僅卅四張，其中除廠家七張購布一五二〇疋外，悉爲布號所購。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司供售棉布，共有十七種，計被單二種，二十支廿一支B字龍頭細布，價爲三百七十五萬元，元嗶嘰及直貢仍未開出，申購者不多。</p>
<h3>紡織界盼當局　考慮棉紗增稅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市紡織界人士語記者：報載財政當局定於四月一日起，將棉紗統稅稅率，自百分之七增至百分之十，表面上雖僅增加百分之三，但實際以百分率計算，較原稅率增加達百分之四十二强。</p>
<p>查棉花統稅原係按照紗價計算，紗價上漲所繳統稅亦隨之加大，如再將統稅之稅率增加，無異旣加底薪，又照生活指數計算，殊非今日埀危之紡織能能負擔。</p>
<p>紡織然爲民族工業中唯一稍具基礎之部門，勝利以後，由於衣着品需要之激增，在表面上紡織業似亦一度呈現繁榮，一般人往往以爲紡織業加重負擔應無困難，即政府部份人士不免亦有此想。</p>
<p>殊不知本業經八年抗戰財力物力早已消耗殆盡，勝利以後以原物料價格激漲，其比例還較紡織成品爲高，是以紡織工業，絕不能恢復戰前　觀。</p>
<p>兼以本業因擁護政府平價及管制政策，所作犧牲尤為重大，現大多數　廠已面臨危機，政府扶植輕工業實應從减低賦稅着手，便本榮臻於繁榮，間接即爲國家增益稅收，如以殺谿取卵之方式，不顧一切，增加稅率，直接增加生產成本，削弱購買力量，威脅紡織事業之生存，問接加重人民負擔，刺激物價上漲，似非妥善之策，深盼賢明當局考慮及之。</p>
<h3>原棉來源充裕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外間紛傳原棉供應將有匱乏之虞，甚至廠家有停工之顧慮，茲據確息，政府對於原棉供應，早已籌備，昨日中央銀行負責人宣布，旬日左右，有美印棉八萬餘包，陸續到滬，另已訂有四五兩月裝船美棉印棉共廿一萬包，並正在續訂六七兩月裝船大量美棉印棉，故紡織業之原料決無問題。</p>
<p>鄂棉商返漢</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕湖北棉商代表團，前向紗管會接洽代購棉花事宜，旨在迅速掌握大量原棉。</p>
<p>茲悉：湖北棉商爲擁護此項政策，承認如承委購，對所領週轉金，願提供十足保證，但要求在漢口領款交花。</p>
<p>紗管會表示：除在指定地區花外，其餘條款，均照與上海棉商所訂合約辦理。</p>
<p>現該代表國一行程子菊·林厚周·袁伯先·王河淸等，已聯袂返漢，擬召集會員大會，報吿洽商經過後，再來滬簽約，以期早日爲政府大量搶購棉花云。</p>
<h3>各區鑒貸數額　鑒貸會開會配定</h3>

<h3>積極防止行莊退票　金管局正調查原因　嚴格執行當日票據不得抵用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金管局局長李立俠氏昨語記者：檢查行莊業務，該局現仍經常執行。一般行莊業務，尙稱正常。至退票數字，現約佔交換總金額百分之二，尙不能稱龐大。惟該局正積極調查退票之原因，俾視退票之咎，在客戶抑行莊本身，然後予以相當</p>
<p>又訊：金管局對退票正硏究設法防止，將對退票原因加以澈查，其責任如在行莊方面，當予懲一處，如責任在客戶方面，則調查其作用何在，並予有效制裁。並稱，關於當日票據不得抵用，該局嚴格執行云。</p>
<p>又訊：金管局頃接獲財政部令，對本市各行莊之退票事項，應予特別研究，並規定每一存戶，如發現有三次退票事實，除予以警吿外，並除掉該戶頭之存名。又如現同時於三地或三行莊發生退票，亦予同樣處分，絕不姑息。昨金管局特約警經濟科，會同淸查該項事件。</p>

<h3>評話小識</h3>
<p>— 戴不凡</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>評話中的「入話」（即「得勝頭迴」，相當於彈詞的「開篇」。）也有許多是有來源的。如「拍案驚奇」第三十三卷「張員外義撫螟蛉子，包龍圖智」合同文」的「入話」，就出在「宋名臣言行錄前集」（朱熹輯）卷三張詠的一篇中：一公在杭，有富民將死，子方三歲，乃命其婿主其貲，而與婿遺書曰：「他日欲分財，即以十之三與十，七與婿。」子時長立，果以財爲訟。婿持其　詣府，請如元約。公閱之，以酒酹地曰：汝之婦翁智人也。時以子幼，故以此屬汝。不然，子死汝手矣。乃命以其財三與婿，而子與七，皆泣謝而去。（碑）」——註：上簡錄自明崇禎張宋原刻本。文末附有小「碑」字一個，此事諒係朱子錄自張詠墓碑者，</p>
<p>上面的情節，正與拍案驚奇中所說的相同。不過，後者把遺書改爲：</p>
<p>一張一非我子也家財盡與我婿外人不得爭佔一</p>
<p>因讀法（標點）的不同，而由知縣把它判決的。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>關於評話小說題材的來源，趙最深先生用力甚勤，幾乎已把「三言一「二拍」的故事，全部找到了「娘家」。我想，如果有人再把這些評話的「入話」的「娘家」也找出來，不是是更有意思嗎？</p>
<p>「人話」的來源，除了像上節所述的應用省本上的故事，以及由說話或著書人任意編造以外，似乎也有節略前人的評話的。例如拍案驚奇卷二十七的「入話」叙述王從事搬屋失妻，後在衢州團圓的故事，即是「石點頭」第十卷「王孺人離合團魚夢」的大概。「石點頭」和「拍案驚奇初刻」似乎都是崇禎年間的產物。不知道這是拍案驚奇删略石點頭，抑係石點頭敷衍拍案驚奇的？但，一個最可能的假設；恐怕這節宋朝故事原來就是宋人的評話；同時代的作者，諒不致把他人的作品拿來删節或敷衍，而必是都見過前人的東西，加以改編的。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>拍案驚奇初刻第三十六卷「東廊僧怠招魔，黑衣盜奸生殺」，趙景深先生說它出於「太平廣記」，「集異記」等書（見「小說閒話」頁二三四）。但我在「宋名臣言行錄」前集卷三中，也找到同樣的記載。那是記向敏中的「字常之，相眞宗。）：「公在西京，有僧暮過村民家求寄止，主人不許。僧求寢於門外車廂中，許之。夜有盜人其家，自牆上扶一婦人幷　衣而出。僧適不寐，見之。自念不爲主人所納宿，今主人忘其婦及財，明日必執我詣縣官矣。因夜亡去。走荒草中，勿墮　井。則婦人已爲盜所殺，先在其中矣。明日主人搜訪，得之井中，執以詣縣掠治，佾自誣云：「與子婦奸，誘與俱亡，恐爲人所得，因殺之，投井中，暮夜不覺失足，亦隊其中。賊贓在井畔亡失，不知何人所取。」獄成，言府，府吿不以爲疑。獨公（按係指向敏中）以贓不獲疑之，引僧詰問數四。增服罪，但言某生前當負此人死。公固問之，乃以實對。公密使吏訪其賊。吏食于村店，店嫗問其自府中來，不知其吏也。問之日：佾之　何如？吏曰：已誤決矣。雖獲賊，亦不問也。嫗曰：言之無傷矣；婦人者，乃此村某少年所殺也。吏曰：其人安在？　指其舍，吏就舍中掩捕獲之……」這一段，不正是「黑衣盜奸生殺」的故事嗎？</p>
<p>朱熹是宋人，他輯的「名臣言行錄」當然不會不是事實。所以，「黑衣盜奸生殺」倒眞正是一回「說公案」呢！但，手頭沒有太平廣記等書，不然，將這兩個「來源」比較一下，倒也是有趣的事。</p>
<h3>邊城水墨畫</h3>
<p>— 姚慎機</p>
<p>在八年離亂的日子當中，多少人被踢到了西，又踢到了東，誰也不知道自己會流落在那兒，這一年命運也把我安排到龍陵來。</p>
<p>龍陵，是滇西的一個邊城，坐着汽車從昆明出發，在公路上得走個六七天功夫，要穿過無數的田野和村莊，還要經過怒江的大鐵橋，最後得把汽車開足了馬力，翻越那高黎貢山的峯頂，底下的路程就比較方便，只要把汽車順着山坡直　，便可以消到　陵的跟前。</p>
<p>遠遠地望去，這個被崇山峻嶺所包圍的城市，祗不過是一座冷漢的空城而已，走進去一望。才知道牠裏面蘊藏着無限的熱鬧，全城只有一條大街，店舖一家挨着一家，還有不少的地攤，貨物堆積得如山，以五顏六色的罐頭居多，這些全是從緬甸運來的牛奶·咖啡·印度紅茶，和英國出產的香烟，店家都兼營兌換「慮比」的買賣，掛着緬文和英文的招牌，許多店裏都有留　機，成天播送着輕快的音樂，是那樣地悅耳，又是那樣地迷人。</p>
<p>沒來之前，曾聽到不少荒誕的傳說，說這兒已經是　烟瘴雨的地帶，來了才知道這兒的山也是靑的，水也是秀的，有茂盛的森林，還有蒼翠的稻田，野外到處泛濫着一片愉快的綠色，人民的語言和服飾也和我們一樣，他們勤奮地在田裏耕作；有的規規矩矩在做着買賣，親熱地和顧客打着招呼，望着這一派和平靜穆的景象，我也安心地住了下來。</p>
<p>這地方就是雨落得太多，尤其是到了雨季，幾乎沒有一天不下雨，出門時明明看見是好天，半路上忽然來一陣大雨，對着你沒頭沒臉的亂澆，出去總得帶着雨衣雨傘，脚上永遠要穿着一雙套鞋，不過雨落得却很痛快，不像「　湘夜雨」那麽地纏綿，一陣暴雨過後，馬上又曾露出一塊碧藍的晴天，太陽又向着路上的人在笑了，據說龍陵的雨，下關的風，和　衝的女人，爲滇緬路之三絕。究竟下關的雨如何厲書，　衝的女人　麗到什麽程度，都不大淸楚；但龍陵的雨的威力，總算是領敎到了。</p>
<p>過去大概是人烟稀少，滇緬路一暢通，這小城就一天天繁榮起來，多少後方的機關同公司，都在這兒設下了車站和排事處。此外有銀行有郵局，還有稅局和關卡，儼然具有一個都市的雛型，人像黃河裏的泥沙似地一齊堵塞到這兒來，其中有幾位眞的爲抗戰而服務的「傻瓜」，多數是一些聰明的淘金者，他們是來充實自家的腰包的，新的建築日有增加，無數的市招在風裏搖擺。沒有一家生意不好，有的招牌還沒有掛了出去，顧客已經湧了上門。這兒沒有電燈，爲了緬甸的煤汕供應方便，家家都懸有汽油燈，晚上比白天還要熱鬧，深夜從睡夢中醒來，猶聽見卡軍波波地在公路上吼。</p>
<p>生活在這城市裏的，多半是離家萬里的流浪客，結神上多少感到有點孤寂，閒下來就一起擁在咖啡店裏消磨光陰，好者大家同是天涯淪洛人，談起話來也就容易接近，起先只有點頭之交，日子一久，也就像老朋友似地招呼起來了。這兒沒有電影，沒有戲劇，也沒有什麽名勝占蹟。除了吃，幾乎談不上生活的享受。而可吃的東西又是那麼地少，却是一些從國外運來的　頭食物。只有一種「餌塊」算是當地的名產，有點傚東南一帶的炒年糕，味道的確是鮮美。據說乾隆年間，有位征細的大將軍夜　龍陵，俄得肚子直呌，有人炒了一份給他，吃得異常滿意，回去向皇帝請賞，龍陵人極引以爲榮。</p>
<p>在這兒，不大看到女人的影子，有家小館子裏有個年靑的姑娘，這姑娘並沒有受渦敎育，長得也不很美，臉上還有幾顆雀斑，在都市裏誰也不會多顧她一眼，但在這沒有女人的地方，她却像公主一樣受着人的讚當，多少人搶到她家裏去吃飯，爲的是要偸看她眼角上的笑紋，有位在銀行裏數鈔票的大學生，曾用他那記帳的筆寫了一首「胡適體」的情詩贈給她，後來這女人做了一個司機的老婆。</p>
<p>當大家都注視着物價上漲的時候，在酒店裏開心地吃酒猜拳的時候，都沉醉在那　靡之音中的時候，……敵人的鐵蹄衝過來了，戰火從緬甸蔓延到了邊城，幸虧一伙人疏散得快，算是掙脫了死神的懷抱，敵人在邊城盤據了一年多，後來總算給我們搶跑了，今天龍陵又是我們的國土了，不知道又是一番什麼樣子：想來一定會失去日的繁榮，但也不會像渦去一樣荒謬了。</p>

<h3>最近的世界文壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>希臘詩人在英國</p>
<p>凱普坦那基土（Demetrios　Capetanakis）是一位年靑的希獵詩人，在一九三九年被英國參議院請去。三十二歲上因疾病而夭折。他在英國的短暫生活中，却在英國朋友們如席　爾（Edith　Sitwell）·李曼（John　Lehmann）·濮羅默（William　Plomer）之間留下深刻的印象。他還用英文寫過幾　非常有興味的詩和散文。</p>
<p>這些詩和散文，速同朋友們的　詞，都收在最近出版的一本「凱普坦那基士：一位在英國的希臘詩人」裏。需前有照片。席　爾女士悼詞云：「它所傳達的意義的集中是驚人的，帶着眩目的光輝，叙述着可怕的黑暗。」</p>
<p>凱普坦那基士除了談到他所摯愛的現代希臘詩以外，總感到生活是黑暗的。他談到英法德俄的作家，認爲黑暗比光明更多。他談到英國女作家蔡洛特·白朗特，說起她會熱愛過她所敎書的那學校裏的校長。</p>
<p>他談英國詩人的文章寫得還不壞。談到德國大詩人喬治（Stefon　George）的那一篇可說是特殊的自傳。他本國的作家堪基羅普羅斯（Panayotis　Canellopoulo）說起，凱普坦那基士曾經有過一個時期愛讀喬治的作品，後來却猛烈地攻擊喬治的著作。他說喬治是用詩作工具吸引他的朋友們向着他。</p>
<p>集中最好的文章是他論柏洛司特（Provst）·杜思退益夫斯基和闌波（Rimbaud）的，特別是寫闌波的那一篇最好。他仍用他所常用的方法，簡化作家對於人生的態度。這新簡化對於闌波似乎更有價値。他說闌波是審愼地從愉快的到不愉快的。愉快是安慰的一種形式，人們耽於幻想，否認眼前存的可怕的現實。他短時期被愉快的魔術迷住以後，一八七〇年就不再陶醉於愉快，他慶不愉怯地面對着現寶。</p>
<p>的確，人們是尋求愉快的，但愉快却是盲目的。藝術是尋求眞理和人生眞實經騐的，但不愉快也是藝術家所要尋求出來的小徑。這就是席環爾所說的「可怕的黑暗」。那就是凱普坦那基士的天才所在。</p>
<p>他所寫的詩都是心理描寫。他很能抓住英國的語言，倘若有什麽錯誤，應該是新奇和吸引的力量，而不是不相調諧。其中一首「愛伯爾」（Abel），即置之現代英團詩選中亦無愧色。</p>
<p>新近高爾斯華綏（John　Galsworthy）的「福西脫傳說」（Forsgte　Saga）第一。一一卷已由蘇職的英國文學研究者刋行，譯者很多，主譯的人是羅爾怡（M.　Lorye），兩卷均由藝術家柯更（E.　Kogan）裝幀。</p>
<p>愛爾蘭作家阿凱西（SeanO'Casey）的「我敲門」（I　Knock　at　the　Door）亦已由莫斯科國家文麼出版部刊行。還有一種「迴廊裏的圖　」（Pictures　in　the　Hallway）也附在「我敲門」後面。這兩種都是大著作的一部分，顯然還未完成，是自傳的性質。譯者就是專研英美文學的卡西金。</p>
<p>俄國小說導言</p>
<p>我們說俄國小說史差不多等於俄國文學史，這話大約不會很錯的。俄國小說對於歐洲各國的影響實在是太大了。</p>
<p>拉夫林（Janko　Lavrin）是諾定昂（Nottingham）大學學院（University　College）的文學敎授，又是托爾斯　和杜思退益夫斯基研究的作者，新近出版了本「俄國小說導言」（Introduction　to　the　Russian　Novel）。這本書一九四二年曾在倫敦出版過；現在的紐約版加了最後的一章「第二次世界大戰及其以後」。這本書是他演講的底稿，所以行文甚爲流暢。</p>
<p>書前有簡略的介紹，用十面的篇幅來談十九世紀以前的小說，可惜不曾談到西方文昌對於十八世紀俄國小說的影響，以及俄國小說本身的特質。</p>
<p>作者以普希金與哥郭里作爲俄國寫實小說的起源。但據別林斯基說，俄國小說的自然主義派該是起源於杜恩退益夫斯基，而不是哥郭里。</p>
<p>此書叙到一八八〇年後已到偉大作家的末梢，便只像開書目似的，開列一些人名和書名，稍附一點介紹。叙到蘇聯小說，別換一新的境地，便又顯出活潑的氣象</p>

<h3>獨語</h3>
<p>— 郭天</p>
<p>黃昏</p>
<p>近來長時間喜　的散步，看殘陽在江面閃　；腥紅的楓葉在晚風中飄零……。</p>
<p>白帆載着黃昏歸來，槳打着水，泛着一串串的泡沫，又破減了。船夫的身影在水面拉得很長，完全像一根竹竿子。火光映紅了船家女憔悴的臉，空氣中有飯的香氣。</p>
<p>黃昏悄悄地回去了；天上有點點的星光，地下有點點的燈火。歌聲開始在空間振蕩，很粗獷，很動人。生活在水邊的人們的歌聲，有着流水的節奏。工作整大的船夫，歌是疲勞的發洩呵！</p>
<p>農夫們從田野回來，在江　洗着泥脚；「日短，做不了活呀！』　息的聲音。</p>
<p>「眞糟，剛下的麥子，被野鳥吃了好些！』</p>
<p>「秋風起，天氣要冷了。茅屋漏了還沒有修補。」</p>
<p>肩上壓着沉重的鋤頭，在不同的角落裏消失了。</p>
<p>在黃皆裏，我走着，隨手拾起地上的幾片紅葉，我似乎感覺到有點溫暖！我想，這是苦難的人們的心。</p>
<p>黃昏，給我的情感染上了憂悒的色彩。沒有了夕陽的光芒，夜的黑手就伸向了人間。然而黑夜來了，也就有着火光！</p>
<p>江邊的　叢，正有野火在燃燒……。</p>
<p>菊花</p>
<p>感謝友人送給我一盆菊化，寒酸的房間經過一點綴，也有幾分雅氣了。</p>
<p>春天是花朶的季節；紅的，藍的，紫的，白的……到處張着花的笑臉，沉醉於蜜蜂的熱吻。在春風的懷抱裏，吸收着陽光的溫暖；然而，我不愛春天裏的花朶，因爲她們的生命，沒有反抗的堅韌的精神，一陣秋霜，幾翻風雨，就把自己的生命，交給無情的流水……，</p>
<p>秋天，梧桐洛葉，歸雁悲歌，一串充滿寂寞蒼凉的日子呵！然而美麗的菊花，驕傲地開在秋風中，給人們帶來愉快的心情。</p>
<p>屋後的小園栽有臘梅數株，和一排白菊。我之偏愛菊花和梅花，也無非是愛它們在風雪中倔强的氣　。大好秋光，花邊徘徊；或雪下賞菊，淸茶一杯，曾送走了不少的光陰，但那是過去的日子了。</p>
<p>兵荒馬亂，長久過着飄泊的生活，如今屋後的小園，已是野草萋　的荒園了。在作客與鄉的旅人的心，只留下一份回憶的溫馨。</p>
<p>對着案頭的那盆菊花，我用　筆描出她的嫵媚，和塗上我的情感……。</p>
<h3>八仙洞</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>—嘉州紀游</p>
<p>我住在　江的西岸，想到這裏的所謂八仙洞去進逛，必須渡江到東岸去。和狄作伴的是　　，帶了零錢，走向市梢的義渡口去。從前的所謂義渡，原是一種善舉，在某條江水的港口，有些罵着小船，輕駛在險浪之中，不顧自己的性命，同時也藉以向渡客　索其渡價的人，往往犧牲了許多人的性命，後來有人出來，集聚多人的金錢，造起較大的船，雇用可靠的船夫來　駛他，對於必須渡水而過的人們，不取其渡費，但却能穩然而過的這作法，是一種公益的事，在這仍然是晨業社會的嘉州，對於過江的遊客，更給以絕對的方便。</p>
<p>岷江並不寬，而且常是波平如　，所以這渡船，也僅是　長的平常的板船，除船尾有一個小　，供船夫裝置飯具和被褥外，船上沒有其他的結構，而駕船的船夫，也只要在離岸和靠岸的時候，使用幾下篱子，在中流，用　作櫓用的木桿，插在一根木柱上，划上幾十划就可以過去，因此，渡客和船夫，坐在船上，有若無其事的感覺。但那邊的碼頭是相當的高，想見如果在夏天，遇有急雨，附近山上瀉下水來，這岷江也會特別的加寬，而湧起暫時的波濤。我們吃力地走上江岸，就在那山腿的脚下，按照公路向前走，不多久，斜進一條樹木蓊然的山間小路，八仙洞就在那不很高的山頂上，但也必須爬過怕有百多層的石級，但也必須爬過百多　　石級，而還必須　幾個　。</p>
<p>用磚頭唬住了半山上村居人家的狗，一直衝到山上去，茂林修竹之問，露出了房舍，旣有石台，也有　閣，是一種小規範的建築，這已經是八仙洞了。</p>
<p>八仙的故事，是道敎的一種神話，我想其意義，無非是用八個人的生活狀　，象徵一種對於一切不負責任而度其逍遙自在的生活的意思，這八個人，其實到不是完全的　構，雖然各人的出身和履歷不同，但都看破了一切，還入原來的狀態，各從其興趣和嗜好而自然地生活，與世無爭，各終其年，所以稱之爲神仙，神是聰明，仙是自然，聰明而自然，過了一輩子，這便是神仙，這大約是八仙的真意，但這個八仙洞的命名，想來是和原來的人物與意義無關，而是僧這藉此噉飯的所在，像一所沒落的衙門，有官去樓空，剩下無能小吏，留下當年的棋牌印　，借以向遊客乞錢的神氣。似神廟究竟比衙門好，因爲它多少還有些地產，所以這裏倒粉刷得很是新鮮。從依山而立的木壁的舊房子裏，走出了酒糟鼻子的老和尙，兩碗淸茶，使我們坐在大殿之前面臨江的石台上，那大殿其實是山石的穹窿，裏而有彩漆的佛像，看來是到這　來進香的少，喝茶的多，所以，那佛像已經成爲一種華美的裝飾，頗有大型的兒童玩具的意味，而這所謂八仙洞，本來應該是洞天福地，出世離羣的所在，已經也是社會的一角了。但是，能得半天的淸閑，在這裏喝着淸茶，一面和老僧亂談，一面遙望台下綠竹之後的岷江，聰山間的犬吠，樹問的人聲，想到一些在戰爭中死亡的人們，也頗有暫作神仙幾小時的自慰。</p>
<p>我很有想在這裏借住的意思，但和尙說有些空房已經住了軍隊，酒糟鼻子的出家人，他吸着長烟管，裝着葉子烟，他向談話完全是一位老黨櫃的口氣，物價高漲，生活困難，應付苦惱是談話的中心，他也是在掙扎中度日，實　，這世間那裏還有眞的遺世而獨立的人呢？剃光了頭，也不過僅是　自己身上省點事而已。臨走，我拿出茶錢，他堅決的不要，但我堅決的給了他，因爲，在這紙幣還多少有點用處的時候，我有時候仍然害怕不要　的人。</p>
<p>從原來的渡口過江，坐在板船上，看見夕陽照着船夫的手裸的縣體，穿着條補了又補的短褲，和他談話，知道他僅是掙着我給他計算決吃不飽　　錢，而他却有使我們羨慕健康，　君說，水手的健康是因爲他們終年終日在「日光」，「空氣」，「水」的裏面滋養，這實在很有道理，但是，「食的一行」難道不很必要嗎？</p>

<h3>田園頌</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>十有餘年沒有回鄉；這次返里，以載欣載奔的心情走近了故居，見門前一長列的夾竹　，已高達丈餘，心里覺得奇怪：於兵荒馬亂的幾年中，誰有這種閑　逸緻在門前種植夾竹桃呢？入門就問家人門前的一列樹是誰種的？家人聽得我的問語，哈哈大笑道：「不是你自己種的嗎？」於是猛然記得十餘年前確實有過種樹的那回事。樹苗是親戚家拿來的，當時長不過三五寸，而今竟是高達丈餘了。自思胡里胡塗的過了十多年，今日仍是依然故我，奄無進展可言，而那些三五寸的樹苗於筆者胡里胡塗過日之由却是長成爲一列高大茂盛的樹木了，眞是一個强烈的對照。心里又想：樹木何以在十餘年的過程中會欣欣向榮，而人事何以往往會沒六進展呢？考其原因，諒是樹木的生長一任自然，而人事往往會橫生枝節，阻礙重重的綠故。</p>
<p>都市的鬧與鄉村的靜，也形成一個强烈的對照。尤其是到了晚上，全村可謂已入無聲之境，靜得耳際只可以聽得靜寂無聲的聲音。不知是晚上沒有行人的緣故，抑還是經一過了幾年戰亂，村民養不起狗了，入晚在村中竟聞不到狗吠聲。自然，鄉村生活的靜，與都市生活的鬧，都祇是表面的。在都市裏，吾人雖見人們熈熈攘攘，車水馬龍，形成了鬧烘烘的一團，可是在人們心的深處，不免也存着一種冷漠之感；即以里弄生活而論，鄰居們還不是爾爲爾我爲我，各不相關？至於鄉村生活呢，在今日的這種環境之下，鄉民那裏還能過眞正安靜的生活。故在鄉村裏表面上是靜，骨子裏還是不免緊張。只是比較起來，在鄉村生活裏，那種都市裏所慣見的不必要喧囂是不會有的，蓋鄉民的緊張往往由於環境，出於被動，而都市里的緊張却多是由於自擾。</p>
<p>近年來我鄉居民盛行一種「合作養豬」的辦法，此乃是一種經濟論著中所沒有的農村經濟學，頗足一述。約於四五月裏，村民便開始養豬，可是豬的主要食料—糠—在百物昂貴聲中，竟也成了一種並不便宜的東西，所以有的人雖想養豬，可是覺得負擔太重，有養不起之感，於是想出了一種合作的辦法：比方你家於碾食米時所得的糠，覺得並沒有什麽其他的需要，你可以每月把所餘的糠供給養豬人家喂豬之用，與之約定，你每月供給若干食料，那麽那一隻豬的若干部份便是　於你的，到了臘月將盡新歲將臨之際，把那隻豬殺了，你便可分得豬肉若干部份。這個辦法筆者認爲萬分合理。這也可說是經濟濟動　不定中的鄉村經濟情調之一。</p>
<p>鄉村生活在這個動盪時代固然不如往昔的那麼淸靜了，可是我總覺得要比都市生活來得可愛，來得現實。都市生活里有一大半的事，我們實在只能名之曰「空虛」。美國都市的居民對於都市生　覺得厭惡的時候，便往往心起Get　away　from　it　all的感覺，決心移到鄉間靜僻處去居住。論者或謂這是逃避現實。據筆者　來，這只是逃避空虛，不是逃避現實。何况那些美國人移居於荒山孤村去並不是爲　懶，却仍是過着辛勞的魯濱遜漂流記式的生活。我國士人素來崇尙田團生活，可是關於田園生活的著作，除了陶洲明的歸去來辭短短的一　抒情文外，恐怕就很少見；而近年來美國的出版界對於這類著作却着實出版了不少，其中電頗有幾册是厚厚的大著，攝爲影的「鷄蛋與我」便是其中之一。</p>
<p>筆者近來頗想擺脫都市中的空虛生活，到荒山孤村中去過孟子所述許行式的自耕自織的田園生活。這種生活，詩意是談不到的。依我的幻想，最好能有一坡不太峻峭也不太平坦的山地，種些桃李瓜果；山脚之下最好能有幾畝晨田，種些稻麥棉花；再養些鷄　牛猪，所獲農產品自用而有餘，則去交換些肥皂洋燭等日用品；山嶼平坦處蓋幾間茅廬，携老絮幼，居住於此，日出而作，日入而息。這樣的生活大概也可無愧於自己對得起人們了吧。這是我理想中的「世內桃源」。</p>
<h3>算「命」與算「財」</h3>
<p>— 白楚</p>
<p>上海命相家之多，簡直呌人吃驚。上有寓在大飯店裏的「眞左筆」，來自外洋的「原子命相博士」；下有擺在馬路邊的「大不同「張鐵口」；甚而至於在小菜塲弄堂口，掛上一張面譜圖，就當起決定別人命運的相家了。</p>
<p>雖然我沒有請敎過他們，但命相家的那一套「哲學」，我是懂得的。他們根據了生肖，落地的時辰八字，面部的五富，手上的紋脈，能算出你將來的成功與否。他吿訴你什麽時候交那一種運，這種運可以交上幾年，如果你這時候做商意，那一定　錢，當大老　；假使作官，那就保證升級，當一個什麽長什麽頭銜的大官。他也會叮囑你某年最好草動，因爲流年不利，容易失官傷財。歷史上名人偉士的「命」，他們算過都是好的，所以，掛起來作爲示範；至於乞丐苦力之類，那是天生命苦。</p>
<p>其實，說穿了，算「命」就是算「財」。「命」的好壞，也就是「財」的多少。什麼時候交運，就是什麽時候發財——至於升官，他們看來也無非爲了發財而已——運能交幾年，也就是能發幾年財和享幾年福的意思，命相家能指示的，如此而已！（爲什麼命相家自己不發財呢？大家是不會想到這問題的。）</p>
<p>中國人崇拜財神菩薩的熱忱是世界少有的，中國人以財產來判斷人，也是世界少有。人的價値，照理並不在他是個老閶，經理，大官，或者小職員，工人。然而，中國人以爲有錢就有了一切，發財愈多，在社會上地位愈高，名氣愈大，成了被人羨慕的對象；絕沒有人再去追究這位財主的道德學問，和他發的財是否用正當方法得來的問題了。上海這種意識形態的表現，尤其來得厲害：穿一套畢挺的西裝，到處可獲便利;如果你著一件靑布長衫，便容易遭受白眼。加上高度的物質的享受在誘感，更刺激人想發大財了。</p>
<p>明瞭這一點，就知道爲什麽中國人愛算命，爲什麼上海這樣一個文化水準很高的大都市，命相事業倒反而畸形發達，命相家在現在是天之驕子，就因爲他能算出你發財的多少呵！</p>
<h3>自私禮讃</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>楊朱的「拔一毛而利天下，不爲也」的主張，不知僅是互不侵犯呢，抑尚欲拔他人之毛以利己？加入他吝惜自己的一根毛，同時也能尊重他人之毛，則雖是自私自利，天下倒也可太平了。所可惜的是，世人爲了利已，竟不惜拔盡天下人的毛，拔毛之不足，還要剝皮食肉喝血，天下焉得不亂呢</p>
<p>可見自私自利也並不是絕對的壞東西，一則可使天下太平，一則足致天下大亂，正如水之可以飲用灌溉，也可以泛濫成屋，火之可以取暖烹煮，也可以災燒焚城一樣。但實際上人類並未蒙其惠，而所受之災害，則遠甚於受諸洪水烈燄者。</p>
<p>人類號稱萬物之蕓，可憐在這一點上寶與別無一樣的不靈，有時更要不靈。試想，你爲了自己的利，而不惜陷害別人，別人豈肯老老實實的受你陷害嗎？同樣，別人爲了他自己的利，還要陷害你呢！此所以世界上殺人利器在一切科學中有最大的成就也。這樣一來，小而言之，人人時刻在钩心鬥角，互相暗算，而時時有遭受暗算的危險；大而言之，國家與國家間，日夕在整軍經武，互相火拼，而日日有戰爭的威脅。結果是：損人之目的旣達，禍己之惡因造成。這全係一種愚蠢的狠心的懦弱的自私自利觀念有以致之。</p>
<p>若夫聽明的自私自利，是岡謀全人類之幸福利益的。一旦人類都有福了，得利了，你也是人類的一分子，你自然也是在有福得利之列，因之，所謂爲人類謀福利，其實不渦是一稱自私自利的手段罷了，但這是聰明的，因之是穩固的。</p>
<p>若夫仁愛的自私自利，則不但不侵奪他人之福利以利己，並有「人溺己溺人飢已飢」的仁愛之心，甚至捨己全人，於心始安。這種捨己爲人的行爲，是爲了解放自己的內疚，滿足自己助人之樂，也是一種自私自利，但這是仁愛的，因之是高尙的。</p>
<p>若夫勇敢的自私自利，乃是向大自然奪取利益，如克服疾病死亡，開闢山川河澤，　逐毒蛇猛獸，抵抗颶風暴雨，發展物質科學……這是以萬物爲芻狗，當然是自私自利；但這種與自然奪利的鬥爭，較之人與人間的鬥爭，更艱險更偉大不知多少萬倍，罪有絕大的勇敢不可。而這種被我們剝削奪取的利益，在大自然是取之不盡用之不竭的。</p>
<p>人類何時才會放棄愚蠢殘忍懦弱的自私自利，一變而爲聰明的仁愛的勇敢的自私自利呢？爲了自私自利起見，我願這樣的時期早日降臨。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第一章　力圖補救　（二四）</p>
<p>雲卿道：「這個我當然有用意的，我替你打算，現在也只有這一條路可定，你　是回去，於你最有益。」渚齊道：「我不能回去，那個家庭我住不下去！」　卿道：「那麽你打算怎麽辦呢？」渚齊道：「我要想離開北平，遠走高飛！」雲卿道：「那麽你還是要到上海去找綺紈去，是不是？」渚齊聽了這句話，低下頭去，把頭微徽搖一搖道：「不！我見她也未必有結果，我打算在外漂泊一生了。」雲卿道：「你剛才說當和尙，現在又說到外面漂泊，這都不　話，這些感情作用的話，過後都會後悔。現在你要改換心情，不要把鳳笙看得那麽討厭，你就認　是位特家健婦，你在外面努力事業，把家庭託給她，決無後顧之憂。以你現在的年齡，也應該往事業上邁進，別總在愛情圈　轉了。現在我打算寫對信給鳳笙，替你解釋，你再去一趕，好不好呢？」渚齊道：「在昨天晚上，你這麼辦，那是可以的，現在再呌我去，我覺得心裏難過。」雲卿道：「那麽這樣辦吧，你先回去，等我把鳳笙那邊弄好了，我　吿訴你吧。」渚　道：「一我今天的來意，不是爲的這個，我的意思是，希望我們以前的目的能　到，我們就進行，假如辦不到，我就離開北平，希望你給我一個明白的答覆。」雲卿道：「你要離開北平，我不贊成，你要想達到以前的目的，也辦不到！」渚齊道：「那麼你呌我怎麼辦呢？」雲卿道：「現在我也不能立刻答覆你，反正我有一個好辦法，過一兩天，你再聽信吧。」渚齋見和雲卿麻煩了半天，毫無結果，很失意的站起來說道：「你好好保養你的身體吧！不必爲我這事操心，我大概再在北平幾天就離開了。」雲卿見他這種表情，也不說什麽，眼看他下樓走了。渚　回到宿舍裏，心想這兩方面都被拒絕了，現在只有自己想法子，跳出這北平城，免得精神上難過。要離開北平，只有兩個辦法：一個在銀行裏找個差事派出去，隨便派那裏去都可以，換個環境，一個找老同學李小松，他在南京很存地位，呌他找個小差事不成問題，不過要永遠離開北平，在父母面前怎麽說，倒是一個難關。</p>
<h3>談聯想力</h3>
<p>— 許津津</p>
<p>據動物學家的研究，老鼠並無過人的智力，有的只是聯想力而已，但是它的聰明或狡猾，似頗令人心折。美國約翰，霍金斯大學敎授華德生氏曾經作過一次有趣的實驗。</p>
<p>他在一塊平面上，佈置一處迷魂陣，堆了許多交叉複雜的小堆。許多七歪八曲的路，都是走不通的。他在正中放了一片乳酪，接着他取出一頭已經餓了幾小時的老鼠，放在迷魂陣的入門口</p>
<p>之後，華德生敎授離開四屋子，從一處老鼠看不到他，也嗅不到他的窗口望進去。他取了一枚掛錶，一支鉛筆和一張紙，將老鼠奔來奔去的情形記下。老鼠嗅到乳酪後，異常興奮，從大路上竄到小徑去，在灣曲的歧路中迷路，又回到大路，片刻間闖入另一條曲折的小路。總之，他一共費了十六分鐘，就取得乳酪。</p>
<p>於是華德生敎授把老鼠取出，次日放在原處。現在老鼠祇花去十四分鐘，就能取得乳酪，它已經認出若干「此路不通」的路，不再上當。說得簡單一些，在第三十次的試驗中，老鼠只費六秒鐘，竄到乳酪所在地。</p>
<p>上述的一項實騐，可替我國的俗語「熟能生巧」下一註解，如站在老鼠本位看來，亦是「失敗是成功之母」的一個旁證。不過，本文的重心不在此，而在說明聯想力爲用之廣與饒有趣味而已。</p>
<p>諸如壺中水淋，蘋果落地，似與蒸汽機及地心定律風馬半不相及，然而瓦特及牛頓兩氏，憑其　富的聯想力，創立新說，不愧爲開拓近代文明的元勳。</p>
<p>其次，睹物思人，常使人感慨無窮，而「睹物思物」亦事所常有。筆者在外間就餐時，見到吃下來的謄　殘肴，或是堆在桌上的魚骨，就想到家中養的那一只胖頭胖腦的小白貓。它向我搖尾乞食的情形，如在眼前。我自然不致於將紙包包了魚骨之類回去，但東之似頗可惜。</p>
<p>有時，我很歡喜翻讀書報雜誌上的時事漫畫。最近在某刊上，見到一幅黑白畫，繪一象徵某國的軍人，喝了一瓶通貨膨脹的酒，體驅龐大，像一個汽球般的浮在空中。我自己正像每一個人一樣，並無浮在空中的經驗，此種況味如何，頗難加以體驗。憑我的聯想力，最多只有在洗浴時，浮在浴缸中的感覺，也許與此近似。</p>
<p>又如我在　發稿件時，爲避免頁次　倒或散佚計，除用漿糊黏貼外，大半用小別針別在一起。我在使用別針時，往往聯想到拆信的對方，稍一不愼，容或針尖有戳破手指之慮。所以我總是將針尖別在文稿的後面，以策安全。我雖然無從知道閱稿諸公是否注意到這一些小節，想來總可免去弄破手指的小不幸吧。</p>
<p>臨末，我想到世界上有許多才智卓異之士，譬如天才數學家，只費一二分鐘的工夫，可以求出複雜算題的答案，天才音樂家能熟諳各種樂器，寫下曼妙悅耳的樂曲。……其原因的一端，或者因爲他們的聯想力特別發達，如仍以數學家爲例，他的腦子像一架複雜的計算機一樣，同時可以加·减·乘·除，不像常人那樣的先加後减，或先乘後除·除此以外，對於天才們的颕悟過人，似頗難尋得其他恰當的解釋了。</p>
<h3>歐洲的古裝</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>從北歐的泥炭沼澤的發掘中，我們得以回溯到一千五百年以前鐵器時代的歐洲人的奇異的古裝。</p>
<p>從這些沼澤中發掘出來的衣服常是還包着穿者的骨頭，或者裹着萎縮了的可怕的屍體。屍體和衣服都告訴我們不少長久以前的歐洲人的生活。</p>
<p>那時代的男人都是穿段褲的，結着一根褲帶；上身的襯衫好像今日西洋女子的襯衣，有的有袖子，有的則沒有。天冷的時候，再加一件四週包裏起來的外套，飾有流蘇，用一隻钩子縛緊。下身有螺旋形的綁腿。鞋是皮的，裏面柔軟，毛則露在外側，並不刮掉。</p>
<p>沼澤中掘出來的女服很少，而掘出來的大多是羊毛衣服，紡織的技巧極好，整個的衣服就如同是一整塊。顏色以黑色和藍的居多。據猜測，當時的婦女以穿蔴爲主，而蔴是沼澤難以保留的，所以都腐化無踪了。</p>
<p>在丹麥，德國北部，和愛爾蘭的沼澤中彼發掘出來的男女與兒意的屍體已有五十多具，其中大部份都是男屍。一般認爲，被沉到沼澤中的人大多數都是根據鐵器時代的法律被判刑的死囚。少數的幾個也許是刺客與殺人者的犧牲品，兇手爲了滅跡，便將他們埋在沼澤中了。</p>
<h3>懷黃賓虹先生</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>目下壽逾八十老畫家，在滬有姚虞琴泉二老，在平有齊白石黃賓虹二老。余之織黃賓老在二十年前，時民國十五年，故友王季歡辦王家印刷所於　海衛路張家花園附近，出版「鼎　」美術週刊，余在濟南出版「　墨緣半月刊」，並曾投寄畫幅刋諸「鼎　」。</p>
<p>賓虹適居咸海衛路同孚路口有正書同宿舍內，見余畫，以爲余係其老友太倉兪劍華，遂寄一長函，述闊別之意，余覆函說明，並致謝意。是年夏余來悔上，寓王家印刷所內，與賓老相距咫尺，遂時過從，遂訂忘年之交。民十八重陽日，賓老導余至太倉與同名姓之兪劍華相會，詩酒留　，頗極一時之興會。</p>
<p>民十八九年之頃，故友張善孖與其弟大千居西門路西成里，賓老曾由余之介，租居樓上廂房，而熊松泉與故友馬企周均居相去不遠之永裕里，後余亦移居永裕里西鄰之西湖坊，與西成里望衡對宇，遂邀故友陳剛叔蔡逸民共八人組爛漫畫社。賓老年最長，大千年最幼。其後賓老一度接辦神州國光社，遂移居福煦路汾陽坊。神州國光社本爲鄧秋枚所創辦，專用珂　版影印古書畫碑帖，並編印神州國光集，神州大觀，及美術叢書，賓老多襄其事。賓老接辦之初，本擬仍繼續美術出版事業，乃不久變質，主事者反致力於唯物史觀之社會科學，賓老遂悄然退出。</p>
<p>賓老於廿六年北上，將任職故宮博物院，惟不久七七事變起，速整居故都，不得南下，閉門著書作畫，不問外事，生活極爲淸苦。賓老生平自奉甚儉，毫無嗜好，能飲酒而未嘗醉。相識二十年，未　見其有　　之疾。平生研究書畫外，更喜收銅印，取其文字以　鐘鼎說文相印證，積稱盈尺，惜未刋行。所畫以山水爲多，足行萬里胸罷萬卷，睢多寫景，　乃自抒胸　，惟近年所作，用　過重，似少淸疏之叛耳。昨閱報載有實老一目失明之消息，北　燕雲，馳懷老友，甚望其言之不確也。</p>

<h3>俞樓回溯</h3>
<p>— 半夢老人</p>
<p>前日凌霽漢閣中州洛陽篇，云及兪曲園由河南學政，被劾落職回籍，因而想及兪曲園先生督學河南，他出了「王速出令反」「君夫人陽貨欲」的題目，被人彈劾落職，但他的詩集中，只說「予視學中州，偶因人言而罷」，不提及此事。他說：「雲烟過眼了無痕，歸臥鄉山好杜門，萬事是非　吏議，一官去就總君恩。」又說：「莫怪流言太不根，」可知出題之事，想係不經之談，無非有人欲借此中傷他而已。他的夫人並有「朝冠卸後一身輕」之句，思想純正，無可非議。又說：「未磨圭角難諧俗，獨抱冰心可對天。」宦海風波，隨時能起，但害他反而與他有益，從此放浪湖山，安居天堂一樣的蘇杭兩處，把羣經平議一書著述起來，成了淸代有動的大經　家。</p>
<p>他先主講蘇州的紫陽書院，後移主杭州詁經精舍，　王蘭泉孫星衍兩公之後。曾文正公會說兪蔭甫真讀書人（蔭甫曲園字），又說李少荃拚命作官，兪陰拚命著書（少荃，李鴻章字），可見一時皆推戴他，名不虛傳。他游九溪十八澗詩云：「重重疊疊山，曲曲環環路，東東丁丁泉，高高下下樹。」丈爲巧妙恰當。</p>
<p>他想在西湖中，照厲樊榭「浮梅　」之法，用巨竹爲桴，浮湖中，編蓬屋桴上，朱闌　之，設靑帳幕啓閉，下鋪文木板如　，其中可容六七胡床，幾席觴豆彝鼎愚洗茶鐺募局之屬，往來湖中，後卒未果，祇在蘇州曲園內作小桴，略具形式，名「小浮桴」而已。</p>
<p>其後詁經精舍諸弟子，爲他築樓孤山之麓，地在六一泉西，東爲孤山寺，　池疊石，名曰兪樓。他的兪樓有四異：（一）佛異：他夢見古佛不裝金，由碧　門入，一鶴守書其下。（二）仙異：夜半湖中荷花大開，思得小舟採之，忽有二童子掉一舟來，登舟，深入花中，盡興而返，返時，童與舟皆不見。（三）神異：松樹上見一淺綠色之蛙，竟體如碧玉琢成，無磊砢狀，斷爲金華將軍之神。（四）鬼異：兪樓築時，夢一靑色人自西牆外至，向人而拜，次見樓西有　，忽刻石工人夢靑色丈夫，自言爲明季裨將王慶祥，囑勿相犯，乃改道築路登山以避其墓。傳開如是，姑妄誌之。</p>
<p>兪樓的小景，有小曲園，　霞西舍，瓢池，伴坡亭，靈松閣，小蓬萊，西爽亭，鶴守　，文石亭，曲園書藏，文泉諸處。他的兪樓二字，爲彭剛直公玉　所書，他說：「陶廬謝　總千秋，如我徵名豈足留，行到白沙隄盡處，居然人盡識兪樓。」</p>
<p>不料他的詩意成議語。鄙人於去年偕同兪靜齋游覽西湖，靜齋意欲借兪樓爲休息之地，以其姓兪，今古相同，樓屬於兪，可無異議。誰知　覽孤山西畔，竟不見兪樓所在。曲園先生所謂「豈足留」，難道「竟不留」耶！靜齋曾以詩寄余云：「玉岫金彼接遠天，披襟一步一留通。三遷重看新秋月柔　輕搖退省前。（退省庵，彭雪　　　　　　記春鷗入遠江，此來雁　　成雙，浮生常作湖　　（　　），未上蓬　恨滿腔。（謂小蓬萊）」蓋以兪樓已賃與杏花樓酒菜館，風雅地竟成酒肉塲，曲園先生有知，當爲歡惋。嗣後余這暑紫雲洞，靜齋又寄二絕云：「欲買西湖地數弓，結　聊以息吾躬，晨議暮靄　眸望，畢竟青山屬老翁。精　仍署碧霞門（俞樓左有碧霞門），喜見經飾道獨存，一樹紅梅還木放（兪樓前有紅梅，十月盛開，彭雪琴爲曲園作紅梅一幅。）軍來姑醉杏花村（謂杏花樓也）。」湖中佳處正多，儘可重築兪樓，爲湖山點綴，惟惜曲園先生一代經師，著述等身，不充保留他經營的名迹，後來者有人去樓空之感耳！</p>

<h3>First Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly: Election of Provisional Chairman and Secretary-General; Lively Discussion on the Election Law for the Presidium</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] The first preparatory meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:45 AM on the 30th. The Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, Hong Lanyou, first reported two points: (1) A total of 1,798 delegates were present today, exceeding the legal quorum, and the meeting was declared open. (2) Before the presidium of the assembly is elected, the preparatory meeting today should elect a provisional chairman. Delegate Yu Youren then proposed that Hu Shi serve as the provisional chairman of the assembly and Hong Lanyou as the provisional secretary-general. Hu Shi, in turn, proposed Yu Youren. Finally, it was unanimously agreed that Hu Shi would serve as the provisional chairman of the assembly today. Mr. Hu arrived at the podium at 10:50 AM and first raised the issue of the provisional secretary-general. After a vote, Yu Youren's proposal that Hong Lanyou serve in the position was passed. After each took their positions, Mr. Hu announced the start of the discussion. Two items were scheduled for discussion today: (1) The draft method for electing the presidium of the assembly. (2) The draft method for arranging delegate seating. The first item was discussed first. After Hong Lanyou read the full text of the draft method, the delegates began to express their opinions. From 10:10 AM to 12:00 PM, when the meeting was legally adjourned, 35 people, including Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuxiu, Li Zhonglin, and Yan Shaoyi, spoke. Because there were more than 50 people who had submitted requests to speak, and the time was insufficient, the chairman proposed an idea and sought the consent of the delegates. The secretariat would sort out the opinions expressed today, summarize them into several specific points, and submit them to the next preparatory meeting for discussion. If anyone has new opinions different from the summarized points, they can present them to the assembly. This was unanimously agreed upon. Finally, the chairman announced that the meeting would be adjourned this afternoon, and the second preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Yu Youren</p>
<p>The "Draft Method for Electing the Presidium," which was discussed today, was drafted by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee based on Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law. The draft stipulates: "(1) The presidium shall consist of 25 chairpersons, who shall be elected by the delegates from the general list of candidates for the presidium by secret ballot, with the candidates receiving the most votes being elected. In the event of a tie, the matter shall be decided by lot. (2) Candidates for the presidium shall be elected by each delegate-producing unit. Each unit shall have at least one candidate. Units with 30 or fewer delegates shall elect one candidate, 31 to 60 delegates shall elect two candidates, 61 to 90 delegates shall elect three candidates, 91 to 120 delegates shall elect four candidates, 121 to 150 delegates shall elect five candidates, and more than 151 delegates shall elect six candidates. Each unit with more than five candidates should have one woman. The candidates are elected using secret ballot, with the candidate who gets the most votes is elected (separate ballot for women), which will form the general candidate list. The elected candidates are not limited to the delegates produced by the unit. When each unit elects presidium candidates, the eldest delegate of each unit shall convene the meeting. (3) This method shall be implemented after being passed by the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly." The appendix lists the 60 units and the number of candidates that they should produce, a total of 133 candidates, including 11 women.</p>
<p>Provisional Chairman Hu Shi</p>
<h3>Presidium Should Increase the Number of Seats So That Each Unit Can Participate; Pan Gongzhan's Opinion Wins Overwhelming Support</h3>
<p>The election method stipulates that the number of presidium chairpersons is only 25, which the delegates have debated for a long time. They believe that according to the last Constituent National Assembly, the total number of delegates was only 2,024, and the presidium had as many as 55 chairpersons. The total number of delegates to this assembly has reached 3,045, an increase of 50% compared to the past. The number of presidium chairpersons has been reduced to 25, which is unreasonable. Moreover, since there are 48 delegate-producing units, in order to be universal and to accommodate opinions from all sides, the number of seats should be increased so that each unit has a representative to convey its views on the presidium. However, some people believe that this election method is based on the National Assembly Organization Law, which is based on Article 34 of the Constitution. If the number of presidium chairpersons is to be increased, the National Assembly Organization Law must be amended, which is equivalent to amending the Constitution. If the Constitution is not amended, it will be unconstitutional. Therefore, they argue that the number of seats should not be increased. In the meeting, more people agreed with the opinion of increasing the number of seats, and fewer people agreed with the latter opinion. When the delegates spoke, they also raised some opinions on the amount of increase and the method of production, etc. Delegate Pan Gongzhan put forward three opinions, saying: (1) The regulations on the number of presidium chairpersons must be revised. I believe that the National Assembly Organization Law formulated by the Legislative Yuan is too detailed. The Assembly should send the National Assembly Organization Law back to the Legislative Yuan and delete the sentence about the number of people, only listing "a certain number" is enough, and then the Assembly will discuss the number of people. (2) I believe that the number of presidium chairpersons should be increased by 50% according to the proportion of the Constituent National Assembly, that is, 55 plus 28, and this National Assembly should have 83 people. (3) According to the 60 units in the election method, each unit has one person, and the remaining 23 people are elected by the Assembly using the non-cumulative method, so that units such as regions and overseas Chinese at home and abroad can participate in the presidium, which can gather ideas and benefit. Mr. Pan also made some comments on the duties of the National Assembly delegates. He believes that the Legislative Yuan has stipulated too few presidium chairpersons, which seems to think that this National Assembly is only responsible for elections, which is easy to handle. In fact, the Assembly has the power to amend the Constitution, and we cannot say that it must not be amended. Discussion is one thing, and passing it is another matter. If the Constitution is amended, the Assembly will not be able to complete it by the 22nd, and the task will be heavy, which cannot be handled by the presidium of 25 people. Mr. Pan's opinion won the approval of the vast majority of delegates. After that, some delegates spoke, but none of them exceeded these principles. The enthusiasm of the discussion has opened up the grand occasion that this National Assembly must have.</p>

<h3>National Assembly Delegates Continue Hunger Strike; Glucose Injected Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Hu Shi and others continue to run around to persuade</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] Ten National Assembly delegates, including Yan Zezi, who firmly refuse to give way to friendly parties, continued their hunger strike on the 30th. The Central Hospital was ordered to send personnel to inject glucose into them on the morning of the 30th, but only Yang Qiaoxin, who was older, was injected. Doctors were sent to check their health again in the evening. On the 30th, Yu Bin, Hu Shi, Mo Dehui, and Wu Yunxu ran around to persuade them all day long. Yu and others visited Chairman Jiang at 9:00 PM to report on the persuasion and the proposed solutions. It is reported that Yu Bin's proposed solution is still to increase the number of seats so that they can attend the Assembly. Another proposed solution is to offset the number of seats with the seats of delegates from Northeast China; delegates from Northeast China and people from Northeast China living in Beijing have expressed their opposition.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Delegates Continue to Register; Neng Kewu and Others Will Fly to Beijing Today</h3>

<h3>More Than 400 National Assembly Delegates Support Sun Ke's Election; Hu Shi and Zhang Zhiben Participate in Signing the Nomination</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] Hu Shi and Zhang Zhiben participated in signing the nomination of Sun Ke as a candidate for vice president on the 30th. After arriving in Beijing, Mr. Hu told Chen Xueping, Minister of Youth, that he would vote for Sun Ke. Mr. Zhang declared that his decision was a careful choice made by eliminating all stale ideas and relational factors.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] Vice Chairman Sun Ke entertained National Assembly delegates from various places at the International Friendship Association at noon on the 30th, with more than 400 people attending. Mr. Sun delivered a brief speech on the spot, first apologizing as the chairman of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee for the inadequate hospitality. Mr. Sun said: Delegates have come to participate in the constitutional National Assembly, and their responsibility is important. It can be said that it is the beginning of democratic nation-building. Democratic politics is not easy to succeed and must go through a long period of hard work and struggle, and can only be successfully built through some mistakes and experiences. All delegates have come to Beijing from various places, representing the people to exercise the highest state power and start the work of democratic politics. Today, I wish you all the completion and success of your mission. The success of all of you is the successful construction of democratic politics in the Republic of China. Then, Zhou Zhongyue, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Zhang Zhiben, President of the Administrative Court, and Yuan Xiluo and Ding Xuanxiao, delegates from Jiangsu, spoke one after another, advocating unanimously electing Vice Chairman Sun as Vice President. They dispersed at 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Debate on the Election of the Presidium</h3>
<p>Special Report from Our Newspaper—(March 30 in Nanjing)</p>
<p>The representatives of public opinion from all over the country began their familiar debate on democratic politics in the National Assembly of constitutional implementation today. From the Constituent National Assembly to the Constitutional National Assembly, the test of public opinion has progressed more and more each time.</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting is only the prelude to the Assembly, and it is only themed with discussing the election method of the Presidium of the Assembly and the election of the candidates for the presidium. However, every minute and every process is almost an opportunity to strive for and exert public opinion. Therefore, the full text of the draft method for the election of the presidium, which contains a total of three articles, took a full two hours and has not yet reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>Today's Provisional Chairman is Principal Hu Shi, who has a gentle attitude and the demeanor of a diplomat. Every time Mr. Hu has a suggestion, he must ask again and again whether it is good or not, so the atmosphere of the meeting can be calm in the midst of intense disputes. Among the election methods, there are three points that have caused disputes: The first is the number of chairpersons. The second is the method of production, and the third is the election method. To put it simply, all those who raised objections completely rejected the original draft, such as the number of chairpersons being too small and should be increased, and the method of production should have representatives from each unit. The original draft of the election method specified the use of the non-cumulative voting method, but the opinions put forward unanimously believed that the non-cumulative single-vote method must be used, otherwise it will fall into the manipulation of one way and be undemocratic. Among these speeches, one representative first raised the issue of the duties and tasks of the National Assembly delegates and the need to amend the Constitution. His speech followed immediately after the Provisional Chairman's speech on a delegate's point that the number of chairpersons should be increased. The Provisional Chairman said this: "The number of chairpersons is based on the National Assembly Organization Law passed by the Legislative Yuan. If the number is to be amended, will it still be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure?" One representative believed that the number of chairpersons must be increased, based on the number of 55 chairpersons in the Constituent National Assembly, and this time it should be increased even more, so why is it reduced instead? At the same time, he shouted loudly, "We want to exercise our powers, we want to amend the Constitution, there are too many loopholes in this Constitution." This first shot aroused the agreement of some people. After that, some people continued to echo his opinion, and Gu Yuxiu also proposed that we must send it to the Legislative Yuan and revise this point. After the Legislative Yuan revises it and sends it back, we will discuss it again. Finally, Pan Gongzhan systematically spoke, specifically criticizing the opinion that some people think that the Organization Law does not need to be revised. He emphasized: We have the right to decide our own affairs, and amending the Constitution is our duty. No one can say that we are not allowed to amend the Constitution. If the Constitution cannot be amended, discussion is okay, and passage is only the secondary issue.</p>
<p>Today, in the agenda document bag of each delegate, there is a small booklet on the basics of civil rights. It tells you that when you have anything you want to do or say at the meeting, first pay attention to the "law" and everything must be legal. When the meeting time was scheduled for 9:00, but the actual meeting time was 9:45, the Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee had to be blamed and asked why the meeting was not held on time and why the work efficiency could not be noticed. However, the Secretary-General and the Provisional Chairman replied that it was to wait for the attendance of delegates to meet the legal quorum.</p>
<p>When the speaking reached 11:30, the Provisional Chairman, in order to request that those who wanted to speak continued to read endlessly, feared that time was limited and hoped that the speeches would be clean. At the same time, he received suggestions from another four or five delegates, requesting that the speeches be stopped and submitted for a vote. But as soon as the Chairman conveyed this opinion, it was immediately opposed. They were almost disorderly, shouting loudly, "Pay attention, in the National Assembly, delegates representing public opinion from all corners of the country need to express their opinions and should not be prevented by anyone. The Chairman has no right to do that." Although the Secretary-General repeatedly explained that this was only accepting the opinions of a few delegates, the waves of opposition still covered everything. Finally, the majority opinion won.</p>
<p>These atmospheres tell us that public opinion is rampant here. No one can resist or prevent it. This is just the beginning, the dispute over the election method of the Presidium is just a flaw!</p>
<h3>Mission of the Legislative Yuan Ends; Must End Affairs by the End of April at the Latest; Farewell Party Will Be Held Regularly</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] After the National Assembly opens, the term of the new Legislative Yuan is not far away. The current President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, declared after discussing the bill at the regular meeting of the Yuan on the 30th: The National Assembly session can be completed in as little as two weeks according to the scheduled progress. If everything goes smoothly, it will close on April 11. Then, according to Article 6 of the constitutional implementation preparation procedure, the first Legislative Yuan should convene itself on the seventh day after the closing of the National Assembly. The new Legislative Yuan should be formally organized and established on April 18, and the mission of the current Legislative Yuan will come to an end. Therefore, the Yuan must end all affairs by the end of April at the latest. The unfinished cases will be sorted out, reviewed, and processed within half a month. The Yuan is scheduled to hold the 352nd regular meeting on April 15. If there is no need to hold another meeting at that time, a farewell party will be held regularly. Lou Tongsun also reported that the Preparatory Office of the New Legislative Yuan, which is concurrently managed by the Secretariat of the current Legislative Yuan, is actively preparing for the meeting. However, many of the newly elected Legislative Yuan members who have come to Beijing from various places are unfamiliar with the place. According to Hong Guanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, the staff of the Preparatory Committee in various places cannot help but serve the new Legislative Yuan members. Therefore, although Legislative Yuan members are different from National Assembly delegates in that they do not receive salaries, and the problems of accommodation and transportation in the capital during and after the National Assembly session are extremely difficult, the Preparatory Office has no choice but to reluctantly do its best to take care of them. Member Chen Guyuan believes that the current Legislative Yuan members have promoted public opinion and helped the government for many years, and they have made meritorious service. It seems that their post-mortem rewards should be considered. At the same time, he also asked President Sun to give them photos as souvenirs. Member Chen Changheng proposed that the election of the new Legislative Yuan members should be determined and announced as soon as possible so that they can register for the meeting. Finally, members Luo Ding and Liu Guanxun also spoke on electoral politics. The regular meeting on the 30th dispersed after noon.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday to Revise the Organization Law of the Two Houses</h3>
<p>The Salt Tax Rate Table was also revised</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held its 351st meeting at 9:45 AM on the morning of the 30th. Yuan President Sun Ke presided over the meeting. First, Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the minutes of the previous meeting and reported that the Yuan's previous recommendations on the Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement between China and Hong Kong had been ordered by the State Council to be transferred to the relevant agencies for attention and handling. Then, various cases were discussed, including: (1) Amendment to Articles 5 and 19 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, (2) Amendment to Article 9 of the Control Yuan Organization Law, (3) Revision of the Implementation Measures for Diesel Import Tariffs and Temporary Surcharges, (4) Amendment to the Salt Tax Rate Table, (5) Amendment to Article 26 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Demobilization, (6) Draft Military Service Reward and Punishment Regulations, (7) Amendment to the Civil Servant Disciplinary Law Draft, (8) Amendment to the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee Organization Law Draft, (9) Amendment to the wording of Article 8 of the Civil Servant Retirement Law, (10) Amendment to the Civil Litigation Cost Law Draft, (11) Examination of the School Teacher Retirement Regulations Amendment Draft, (12) School Teacher Pension Regulations Amendment Draft and other budget proposals. As for the State Council Civil Servant Office's opinion on the constitutional amendment of the election of overseas Chinese submitted for discussion, it was resolved to pass it according to the examination opinion, because the case concerns the amendment of the Constitution, not the amendment of the law, and it is not appropriate to examine it.

<h3>Editorial: The Misguided Path of U.S. Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Since the preparatory meeting for the U.S.-sponsored Japanese peace treaty was shelved, news of U.S. support for Japan's economic recovery has been pouring in. Most noteworthy are the publication of the Strike Report and the announcement in Tokyo by the U.S. mission led by Army Under Secretary Draper of a plan to rehabilitate Japan. Although the contents of these two major plans differ, they are consistent in reducing reparations, raising industrial standards, and lending money to Japan to help it recover. Judging from the situation, U.S. support for Japan's economic recovery, as a means to contain or as a fait accompli of the peace treaty, has become an established and unchangeable policy. This is a misguided path in U.S. policy toward Japan, bringing endless troubles to Eastern countries.</p>
<p>Now, based on various sources and objective circumstances, we will analyze and criticize the various U.S. plans to support Japan's economic recovery:</p>
<p>First, Raising Japan's Industrial Standards: The issue of preserving Japan's industrial standards is linked to the issue of reparations. Initially, there was the Pauley Reparations Plan, which determined which Japanese industries should be used for reparations and which should be preserved based on the Japanese standard of living from 1926 to 1930; the Pauley Plan had already forgiven Japan's textile industry and merchant ships. The next was MacArthur's compromise proposal, which based the preserved standards on Japanese industries from 1930 to 1934, with the amount of reparations being about 60% to 65% of the Pauley Plan. Later, Strike made a recommendation to the Department of the Army, suggesting that the industrial standards be considered from 1930 to 1950, with the amount of reparations being only 30% of the Pauley Plan. On March 1, the Department of the Army published the "Report of the Foreign Affairs Advisory Association" (also known as the Strike Report), arguing that "all Japanese production equipment, except for basic war industries, should not be removed for reparations." Therefore, it advocated for fewer reparations, believing that reparations are a waste. The content of this plan is even more generous than MacArthur's compromise proposal, reducing it by another 33%.</p>
<p>On March 11, the Far Eastern Commission discussed the plan proposed by the United States, which would preserve Japan's annual production capacity: 2 million tons of pig iron, 3.5 million tons of steel ingots, 2.65 million tons of steel plates, 3.51 million tons of sulfuric acid, 10,000 pieces of machine tool products, steel balls and bearings worth 32.5 million yen. In addition, it would allow for 1.9 million kilowatts of power generation, 1.24 million gross tons of merchant ships and 4.52 million tons of ship repair, as well as 9.8 million barrels of oil refining and 7.29 million barrels of oil storage. If this industrial standard is passed, Japan will leap to become the leading industrial nation in the Far East. Therefore, when the Far Eastern Commission met, Eastern countries opposed it together, especially the strong opposition from the Chinese representatives. On the 20th of this month, U.S. Army Under Secretary Draper arrived in Japan and had lengthy talks with MacArthur and Ashida. MacArthur largely supported this new plan, and Ashida, in addition to thanking the United States, requested continued U.S. assistance in rebuilding Japan to make it the "factory of Asia." Ashida was probably not satisfied with the Japanese productivity stipulated in the Strike Report, so Draper issued a declaration on the 26th, saying: "The United States believes that Japan's own efforts in the future, if indicated, may raise this standard without endangering peace, and it may not be impossible to increase it." What kind of talk is this? It simply forgets that Japan is a defeated country and the solemn provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. If Eastern countries do not fear that Japan's high degree of industry is enough to endanger peace, they should make effective opposition and seek to break the deadlock in the peace conference and complete the peace treaty with Japan. Eastern countries have a belief that they do not oppose Japan's economic recovery, but they oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!</p>
<p>Second, Large-Scale Credit Loans to Japan: Japan's reparations have not been fully fulfilled, and some industrial equipment has not been dismantled. Planned industrial recovery is enough to create a situation that threatens any Eastern country. The "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" drafted by the Katayama Cabinet required a large amount of capital to be actively circulated, and the United States showed a strong interest in it. When Ashida Hitoshi came to power, he strived for U.S. aid and requested a loan of one billion U.S. dollars from the Allied Headquarters to implement the five-year plan. According to the Japanese government's plan, if it obtains the credit loan, its industrial standards will be restored to the level of 1930-1934 after the completion of the five-year plan, which is in line with MacArthur's ideal. We do not know what the Allied Headquarters has expressed regarding the Japanese government's loan request. However, several recent facts can point out that the United States has considered and arranged for large-scale loans to Japan. First, the U.S. Congress met and Republican Senator Easland allocated a revolving fund of 150 million for Japan to buy cotton, leather, and raw materials. Second, the U.S. government recently stipulated 275 million yuan for the recovery of Japan, South Korea, and Okinawa, of which about 180 million yuan can be obtained by Japan, which has been submitted to the Congress for discussion and is expected to be passed and implemented. Third, according to news from Tokyo, the U.S. will provide Japan with a loan of 765 million yuan in the next fiscal year (that is, July of this year), including 375 million yuan for social relief, 180 million yuan for recovery, 60 million yuan for cotton loans, and 150 million yuan for trade turnover. This news is a Japanese government probing, but Draper said: The U.S. Congress is considering a plan to make Japan a factory in Asia," which stipulates that 300 to 400 million yuan will be allocated each year to prevent unrest and disease in Japan, and another 180 million will be immediately allocated to revive Japan's economy. Originally, the Japanese government hoped to obtain 765 million yuan to stabilize the fiscal foundation of the Ashida Cabinet in the next fiscal year, but Draper's aid plan is even more magnificent and huge. It is no wonder that Ashida is overjoyed, and the Japanese subjects are like the whole country is free. The Americans laugh, the Japanese jump, and the natural tears are the vast crowd of people who are facing the eve of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>Third, Stopping the Abolition of Economic Monopoly Plans: Japanese capitalism became imperialism because of its economic monopoly. Therefore, the basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission towards Japan is to eliminate Japanese economic monopoly and dissolve Japanese chaebols and the concentration of economic power. The Far Eastern Commission's efforts over the years have passed various plans for MacArthur to implement, but with little effect. Recently, after debate, the U.S. Department of the Army and the Department of State have decided to abandon the "Plan to Abolish Japanese Economic Monopoly" stipulated in Document 230 of the Far Eastern Commission, arguing that the implementation methods of the original plan were too radical. If this plan is stopped, Japanese economic monopoly will be restored, and the chaebols will not only not be dissolved, but may also re-deploy in coordination with the U.S. policy of supporting Japan's economic recovery. Even the law passed by the Katayama Cabinet to eliminate the concentration of economic power will be revised by Ashida Hitoshi. On the 20th of this month, Ashida attended a Diet session and gave a policy speech, saying that the government under his leadership has no socialist color. This shows that the U.S. policy of supporting Japan has pushed Japanese politics backward. This is not fortunate for the future of Japanese politics, but a disaster.</p>
<p>The above analysis of the three points is only in terms of the outline of U.S. support for Japan's economic recovery. The U.S. Department of the Army's approach seems to be slightly inconsistent with the views of the Department of State, but today's United States is still strategic decision-making, not strategic decision-making. The misguided path of policy towards Japan will eventually have a day of awakening. We read Hull's Memoirs and deeply feel the mistake in the United States' assessment of Japan before the war. As a result, it suffered the disaster of Pearl Harbor. Hull, who was clear-headed and enlightened, had vision and strategy. He could not arouse the attention of the authorities and the military. The lessons are not far away. Why is a clear and powerful "Hull Memoir" not perceived by today's American politicians and strategists? We really can't figure this out.</p>

<h3>Li Zongren Hosts Reporters' Briefing, Reports Northern Situation May Improve; Also Announces Motivation and Position for Vice Presidential Candidacy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th Dispatch] Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters Li Zongren hosted reporters at 2:00 PM on the 30th at the Jingjie Hall in Nanjing, announcing his motivation and position for running for Vice President and reporting on the recent situation in the north. Since arriving in Nanjing, Li has repeatedly stated his position and met with reporters separately, but the public reception for reporters on the 30th was the first time. At that time, more than 200 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. Li was wearing a military uniform and smiling from time to time. His wife, Ms. Guo Dejie, also sat next to Li and, at the request of the reporters, expressed her feelings about Li's candidacy. Li first described the situation in the north, saying: Although the situation in the Northeast and North China is more serious, the central government has recently sent a large army to provide support, and the situation is expected to improve. Political and economic measures are also being taken to overcome the crisis. In the future, the primary goal should be to promote a democratic economic policy to stabilize people's lives. Li then continued to state his position on reforming politics, saying that political reform must first start from the central government. If he is elected Vice President, he will assist the head of state in contacting the central leaders to engage in political reform. He explained the motivation and significance of running for Vice President: one is to promote a democratic atmosphere, and the other is to assist the central government and assist the head of state in improving the lives of all people. After Li finished his report, he answered questions from the reporters. Someone asked which of the four vice presidential candidates was the most suitable? Li replied: From my subjective point of view, I am the most suitable. From their subjective point of view, they must also think that they are the most suitable. Someone asked what would be the first thing to do if he was elected? Li replied in a firm tone: The primary task is to eradicate corruption. Asked how to expand the government's foundation, Li said: Personnel should be appointed based on talent. A reporter asked Li's wife about her feelings about Li's candidacy. Li's wife recounted Li's contributions to the country from the Northern Expedition to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying: The country is in trouble, and everyone is responsible. Mr. Li's decision to run at this time is a matter of duty. I did not initially agree with the candidacy, but it was not convenient to prevent him from serving the country and the nation, so I finally turned to support it. I hope that he can retreat, and I also hope that he can succeed.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg's Full Statement</h3>
<p>(Continued from the previous page) "The report on the China Aid Bill by the Foreign Relations Committee has created an impression that we did not intend to create, so the report has been withdrawn. Some of the wording does not reflect the will of the committee or its chairman. This was prepared by the committee staff in accordance with routine procedures and was not reviewed by the committee or myself, with the exception of the wording regarding military assistance. On this point, the committee wishes to make it clear that we do not intend to prescribe any obligations for U.S. combat troops, and, like all other foreign aid, we do not intend to prescribe any obligations beyond the scope of existing legislation. This is necessary for all foreign aid, because we cannot accept unlimited burdens."</p>
<p>"But as chairman, I am responsible for the report. Therefore, I have taken responsibility for withdrawing it. I regret this accident. The committee has fully complied with the scope of aid to China requested by the government and has stipulated that some of the grants may be used as military assistance at the discretion of the Chinese government and has quickly voted on the bill. This action has clearly demonstrated the intention of the committee."</p>

<h3>First Furnace of Steel Produced at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 30th] The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company, with a capacity of 250 tons, was ignited at 00:50 on the 26th of this month and began producing iron at 21:00 on the 27th. The process has been very good for the past two days and will officially produce iron on April 1st. However, due to the limitations of raw materials, the daily iron production will be temporarily set at 150 tons as the standard. This No. 1 furnace was completed 20 years ago. At that time, the European war was ending and steel prices were low, so the furnace was not used for iron production after completion.

After the victory, it was repaired for two years before being fully completed a month ago. The furnace was then warmed up. In order to commemorate this historically significant project, the factory invited Nian Xintian, the founder of the former iron ore mine, to personally light the furnace at the opening, in order to commemorate this event.</p>
<h3>Petition by Factories Relocated Inland During the War Yields Preliminary Results</h3>
<p>President Wang Yunwu Receives Representatives and Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Joint Petition Delegation of National Factories Relocated Inland During the War went to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 30th to petition. The petition yielded some preliminary results. The delegation representatives Wu Yunchu, Li Zhuchen, Li Zushen, Yin Zhizhong, Li Jianting, and others visited President Zhang at the Executive Yuan at 2:00 p.m. on the 30th, where they were received by Wang Yunwu on his behalf. The petition delegation raised three requests: (1) Of the 120,000 tons of Japanese reparations goods originally scheduled to be allocated at a fixed price to private enterprises, it is hoped that 60,000 tons will be sold to the inland relocated factories; (2) Inland relocated factories should pay 10% of the price for allocated goods first, with the remaining 90% to be paid in 18 installments over five years; (3) The price should not be calculated in US dollars at the time of allocation. If it must be calculated in US dollars, the exchange rate should be provided at the time of allocation to convert it into legal tender. Wang stated that the allocation of Japanese reparations goods to private enterprises is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. If the method needs to be revised, the Ministry of Economic Affairs should submit a request to the Executive Yuan for modification, or the Ministry of Economic Affairs should forward the opinions of the petition delegation to the Executive Yuan for review. However, Wang expressed great sympathy for the requests of the inland relocated factories and explained in detail the government's current policy on handling reparations machinery, lasting for more than an hour. At 3:30 p.m., Wu, Li, and others visited Chen Qitian and Division Chief Baochang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Chen indicated that the first two points could be considered and should not pose any difficulties in principle. However, the third point, not calculating the price in US dollars, would be very difficult to achieve. However, the detailed method must be submitted to the Industrial and Mining Division for research and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval as soon as possible. Wu and others also requested Chen Qitian to relay their request to President Zhang, hoping to schedule a meeting so that this issue could be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Election of the Confucian General He Qian - Cheng Qian</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Airmail Dispatch, 30th] Director Cheng Qian's participation in the vice presidential election gives us the feeling that Mr. Cheng has a grand demeanor, and the lineup supporting him and campaigning for him is very broad. When he arrived in Beijing by boat from Hankou, the welcoming scene arranged for him by his friends and related parties was also enthusiastic and grand enough.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng participated in the revolution in his early years and experienced all the battles of the Northern Expedition. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Cheng was also a famous general, serving in military positions, either commanding large armies or planning strategies without a day of rest. This time, Mr. Cheng came to Beijing not only to attend the National Assembly, but also to make the vice presidential election his major task. In the few days after Mr. Cheng arrived in Beijing, in addition to meeting at a press conference, the reporter conducted a separate interview to inquire about the current situation and the issue of participating in the vice presidential election.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng views the current political situation in this way: "I believe that the current difficulties we are encountering in politics and military affairs can be swept away after the implementation of the constitution. The removal of these atmosphere is not only to clarify the situation, but also to increase the hope and trust of the general public in the government."</p>
<p>Regarding his personal election issue, he said: "At this time, quelling the rebellion should really be the first priority; however, due to urging from many parties, I really dare not refuse, but I always think that there is no need for excessive publicity." Mr. Cheng feels that the success or failure of the election is all entrusted to the national representatives, believing that they will have the most prudent choice, and personal success or failure is just a test.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng believes that the task of the vice president is only to assist the president. Since the written regulations do not define his powers, the greatest task should naturally be to assist the president. Mr. Cheng also humbly said: "If he is fortunate enough to be elected, he will definitely do his best to assist the president and promote the implementation of the constitution. At the same time, he should promote the Three Principles of the People as a major task."</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng is a revolutionary soldier, a figure who commands the wind and clouds, but when mentioning Mr. Cheng's name, few people seem to be able to compare his literary talent and martial arts, or even know that Mr. Cheng is actually a Confucian general. In fact, Mr. Cheng's poems and essays are worth praising, and he has authored a collection of poems. In his poems, we can see his heroic spirit and refined style. These remarkable achievements during his military leisure are worthy of admiration!</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng is from Hubei Province, and the first to support him this time are the people of Wuhan. For Mr. Cheng, Wuhan should be a place of historical significance. Thirty-seven years ago, Mr. Cheng participated in the first uprising. Later, he returned to Hubei twice to hold important positions. Wuhan is a region he is familiar with. After the victory, he also served as the director of the Wuhan Headquarters, and the people of Wuhan have an even deeper memory of Mr. Cheng. Therefore, this time he is participating in the vice presidential election, and the strength of Hubei will definitely be supporting him. Furthermore, since the two lakes are originally one family, Hunan is naturally his territory. In other areas, such as among military personnel, there are many who seize the opportunity to recommend him. Mr. Cheng's view of the vice president is not the most difficult, but he is not doing it because it is "not difficult". Because of being promoted by his subordinates, he came out to participate in the election; it is not for fame, but because he also has self-confidence: if the president is in trouble, he can shoulder this important task and promote the country's major missions. Moreover, those who support him to participate in the election naturally believe in him even more deeply.</p>
<h3>US Announces Aid to Korea; US Garrison in South Korea Increased to 20,000 Troops; US Undersecretary Returns to Tokyo from Seoul by Air</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 29th] US Under Secretary of the Army Draper, who arrived here three days ago, recently issued a statement through the office of General Hodge, commander of the US occupying forces, stating that the United States is planning a plan for Korea similar to the European Recovery Program. He said that this Korean aid plan was proposed by the Department of the Army, has been approved by the State Department, and has been submitted to Congress. If it can be passed by Congress, Korea will be able to obtain the machinery and parts necessary to increase production, as well as a considerable amount of raw materials. Draper stated that Korea must import more raw materials and raise production levels to establish a sound economy and curb inflation. He said that the purpose of the aid plan is to assist in recovery rather than relief. He also stated that the food situation in Korea has improved greatly compared to last year.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] US Under Secretary of the Army Draper and his party, who departed from Tokyo on the 27th to investigate South Korea, arrived at Haneda Airport at 6:35 PM on the 29th by plane, returning to Tokyo.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 30th] Well-informed sources revealed on the evening of the 30th that the US troops stationed in southern Korea have increased by about 50% in the past two weeks. Not long ago, the number of US occupying forces was still 13,000, but now it has reached 20,000. This news was revealed just as news came from Seoul that the Soviet Union and the Korean Communists are building large-scale fortifications on the boundary between the US and Soviet occupation zones. However, those in charge here said that there is no connection between these two developments. At the same time, they admitted that the political situation in Korea has been deteriorating in recent weeks, causing the troops under the command of Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in South Korea, to be reinforced. One side stated that the army recruitment program lacks effectiveness, so "the number of people needed by Hodge had to be reduced." According to the US Army, it requested to recruit 38,000 soldiers this year, but the budget only stipulated 30,000, and the number of volunteers is still less than this number. Certain American officials here do not intend to express their specific views on the Soviet occupation zone's strengthening of fortifications in news reports. They said that they do not believe that the Soviet Union will adopt such direct and open methods, because this move will soon make the Soviet army itself unable to stay out of the matter. However, they do not deny that the North Korean Communists may, under the orders of the Soviet Union, create border incidents and declare to the North Korean people that this is a southern invasion, further promoting the North Korean army's invasion of the south. The most accurate estimate in Washington is that the Soviet troops occupying North Korea number between 40,000 and 45,000, and the number of Korean Communists under their wing is about 150,000 to 200,000. However, it is generally believed that the construction of trenches is just a psychological posture, intended to show the North Korean people that the US military in the south will launch an offensive, and to make Koreans more supportive of the communist puppet government. At the same time, officials here still believe that the invitation of Kim Gu and other South Korean right-wing figures to Pyongyang on April 14 to jointly discuss the organization of a pan-Korean government "is a smokescreen, aimed at confusing the public or discrediting the South Korean general election on May 9, which is presided over by the United Nations." It is believed here that the trip of right-wing figures to North Korea will benefit them, because after this test, they will probably abandon all hope of reaching an agreement with the northern communists.</p>
<h3>North Korean People Dig Trenches and Gun Emplacements Under the Supervision of the Soviet Army; Construction Concentrated at Essential North-South Transportation Points</h3>
<p>[United Press International, US Military Outpost No. 18, North Latitude 38 Degrees, Korea, 29th] Soviet troops and villagers in northern Korea have been digging trenches, foxholes, and gun emplacements near the dividing line between the US and Soviet occupation zones for unknown reasons. According to visitors from the north, the Soviet Union has been propagating to the North Korean people that the US military and the South Korean people intend to attack north latitude, and the order to build the defensive line is intended to prove its truth. This construction was first discovered by US sentries at the beginning of this month, when it was still thought to be a ditch for irrigating farmland. Around March 9, the work intensified, the nature of the work gradually became clear, and foxholes that could accommodate one or two people appeared.</p>
<p>The trenches are six feet deep and are connected by communication trenches two and a half feet deep. The foxholes are ten feet in diameter and are equipped with gun mounts that can accommodate 81mm American-style mortars. It is reported that the construction is concentrated in five mountain valleys that are essential for north-south transportation. The trenches control the highways and railways in each valley. As of yesterday, more than 32 trenches, each 30 to 50 feet long, have been discovered along the 38th parallel, and three or four new trenches are being discovered one after another every day. They first appeared in the western end, and then moved east, bordering the demarcation line, only a stone's throw away from the US occupation zone. There is no activity in the US occupation zone, only sandbags are placed outside several village police stations several thousand yards south of the boundary, on a small scale. Most of the construction in the Soviet occupation zone is being carried out by Korean civilians under the supervision of the Soviet army, and the Soviet army occasionally participates in the digging. When villagers set out to work, they often sing and wave flags, marching in formation, in rows of two or three people. Sometimes they dig trenches at night, and cover them with branches during the day. Recently, they have even appeared openly, not avoiding the eyes of US sentries. Today, sentries used telescopes to observe within 100 yards south of the boundary and caught sight of thirty or forty Koreans, all dressed in white, standing shoulder to shoulder on a mountainside about 2,000 yards away, starting to dig a trench about 50 yards long, taking turns to rest. One or two Soviet soldiers were supervising the work nearby. By the afternoon, the trench was very deep, and the Koreans became very lazy as soon as the Soviet soldiers left. There is a large mountain west of this mountain, on which three trenches have been dug, which are obviously completed, stacked high and low, overlooking the highway, close to the US sentry post. Two border villages have recently relocated entirely to the north, reportedly because the ditch diggers were interfering with their daily lives and farming.</p>
<h3>Korean Committee Resolves That South Korea Shall Hold Elections on Time</h3>
<p>Hodge Had Requested a Postponement</p>
<p>[United Press International, Seoul, 30th] The United Nations Korean Committee voted on the 30th, with four votes in favor, three votes against, and one abstention, to hold general elections in Korea on May 9, despite the fact that Lieutenant General Hodge, commander-in-chief of the US forces in South Korea, and the Korean Election Committee requested that the general election be postponed to May 24. Lieutenant General Hodge and the Election Committee stated that voting in remote areas could not be held in time at that time. The United Nations Committee stated that if the United States and the Korean authorities worked hard, this difficulty could be overcome.</p>
<h3>America Will Not Sit Idly By While Free Nations Are Enslaved</h3>
<p>US Mediterranean Fleet Visits Athens</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 30th] President Truman addressed a large number of Greek-Americans yesterday, stating that the United States will make peace with any country, but will never sit idly by while the freedom of any country is eroded. The United States does not want war and has never wanted war, but there are some things that are worse than war, including enslaving others.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 29th] US Mediterranean Fleet Commander Sherman will arrive in Piraeus, Athens tomorrow aboard the US cruiser Rochester for a visit, accompanied by the cruiser Taunton, two destroyers, and the transport ship Vermillion.</p>
<h3>Baruch Supports US Military Preparations; Wallace Criticizes Them</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, today, Third Party presidential candidate Wallace appeared before the Senate Military Affairs Committee to testify, making a lengthy speech, strongly criticizing President Truman's request to implement universal military training, claiming that the Truman administration deliberately created a false crisis to lead the American people to war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Former President Consultant Baruch testified before the Senate Military Committee, urging the immediate implementation of military mobilization, supplemented by industrial and economic mobilization, so that universal military training can be placed at the peak of a solid preparedness foundation. He pointed out that the obligations of the United States require persuading the members of appropriate military forces, so that foreign economic assistance will not be abused, and that the statements of the United States will generate power. To prevent war, it is necessary to strengthen military strength before a crisis occurs. We must never again allow the lack of preparation in the United States to encourage others to launch aggression against the United States or other peaceful countries.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Treaty Negotiations Reach General Agreement</h3>
<p>Mannerheim Arrives in Switzerland for Convalescence</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 30th] It is believed here that the Finnish delegation has almost reached a general agreement with the Soviet Union on the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance treaty. Since the start of these negotiations, the progress has not been made public, and both the Soviet and Finnish sides have strictly maintained secrecy, so details are impossible to obtain.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Swiss radio reported that former Finnish President Marshal Mannerheim arrived in Basel, Switzerland today and transferred to Locarno for convalescence.</p>
<h3>US Senator Attacks Marshall's Diplomacy Again; Demands Removal and Replacement</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 29th] Minnesota Congressman Knutson reiterated his demand on the 29th that Marshall should be removed from office immediately. He said that if we want to avoid war, Marshall's removal is absolutely necessary. Because of the critical situation that currently exists in the world, it is essential that the United States' diplomatic affairs should be in the hands of a trained and skilled diplomat. Based on his record of many diplomatic failures, he does not believe that Marshall has this qualification. He said that he is particularly dissatisfied with the results of Marshall's diplomatic mission in China, the Four Powers Moscow Conference last year, and the major changes in the Palestine issue.</p>
<h3>Spain Included in Marshall Plan; US House of Representatives Has Already Approved; Foreign Aid Bill Progresses Smoothly</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, the House of Representatives today passed a resolution, with 149 votes in favor and 52 votes against, inviting Franco's Spain to participate in the $6.205 billion foreign aid plan. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has agreed to include Spain. However, Congressman Voorhis said that the State Department opposes this move. As to whether the Senate will pass the measure is another question. In short, if Spain wants to participate in a European recovery plan, it must, like other participating countries, adhere to the principles of cooperation and self-help.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The $6.25 billion combined foreign aid bill has now overcome its first major hurdle, as the House of Representatives has refused to accept another provision, a substitute bill for $500 million in direct relief to overseas countries in need of aid. Congressman Goodwin intended to defeat the policy of the Foreign Affairs Committee and specially proposed the substitute bill as an amendment. Although the proposal received support from other Congressmen, it was ultimately not passed. Democratic Congressman Celler once again opposed the combined foreign aid bill, including the military aid to Greece and Turkey section. He also denounced the bill as a despicable political maneuver. Some isolationist Congressmen made efforts at the last moment to stop the House of Representatives from overwhelmingly sympathizing with the combined foreign aid bill, denouncing the bill as a "wolf in sheep's clothing." They also attacked the State Department and other unrelated issues. The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a recommendation in the proposed amendment, granting the executor of the foreign aid bill the power to veto export licenses issued by the Secretary of Commerce. The amendment would in effect grant the executor of the bill the power to stop any exports that he believes have a significant impact on US security. The Foreign Affairs Committee also shelved another amendment stipulating $220 million in aid for the economic recovery of Japan, Korea, and Okinawa.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 29th] The Senate is scheduled to discuss the economic and military aid to China bill on Thursday. The Senate has already passed another bill for economic recovery aid to Europe and military aid to Greece and Turkey. Congressional leaders hope that various foreign aid bills can be submitted to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives by the end of this week for adjustment, so as to draft a compromise bill and submit it to President Truman for signature before the Italian general election on April 18.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Molotov Arrives in Berlin and Holds Secret Talks with Soviet Military Commander</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 30th] The British Labor Party's newspaper "Daily Herald" published a report from its Berlin correspondent today stating that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Berlin last night and held a secret meeting with his Red Army commander to discuss the Four Powers crisis in the German government. The correspondent further pointed out that Soviet personnel usually have no difficulty in contacting each other by telephone, but they remained silent last night, and a very strong atmosphere of secrecy enveloped the Soviet military headquarters. According to the correspondent, the purpose of this secret meeting seems to be to break the deadlock between the four countries and preserve the four-country control mechanism.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] It is rumored here that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has arrived in Berlin, but it has not yet been confirmed. At the same time, the Four Powers Allied Control Council meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held on Tuesday (30th), has not been notified by the Soviet Union to convene after the deadline for issuing the convening notice this afternoon. The Soviet Union is the rotating chairman of the Allied Control Council in March, so it should be convened by it. The United States will be the rotating chairman in April.</p>
<h3>US Senate Passes Legislation to Provide Temporary Aid to Italy and Austria</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The US Senate has just passed a bill for an additional $55 million in temporary aid to France, Italy, and Austria by voice vote, and it will be submitted to President Truman for signature after passage.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Approves New Fund for Atomic Research; Relief Funds for Japan, Korea, and Germany Reduced</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, the House Appropriations Committee today approved new funds for manufacturing atomic weapons and conducting new research, opening up a new military highway in Alaska, and combating Soviet propaganda. In addition, it also approved relief funds for the occupied countries. The Army's request for relief funds for Japan, Korea, and Germany, which was $150 million, has just been reduced by $7 million. On the naval side, $1.6 million has been approved to expand the naval base on Guam. Of the $5 million requested for the US news and educational exchange program, $3 million was approved. The $150 million originally requested by the committee on energy was approved in full without reduction.</p>
<h3>Franco's Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Madrid, 30th] Today is the ninth anniversary of Franco's occupation of Madrid. Franco gave a speech to 4,500 members of the Falange and broadcast it nationwide. Franco expressed regret that Spain was not included in the US aid to Europe plan, and predicted that one day, Spain and Western democracies "will fight shoulder to shoulder in the same trench." He said that in the world's anti-communist war, Spain assumed its responsibility ten years earlier than Western Europe. Because other countries ignored the lessons of the Spanish Civil War, "twelve European countries are currently gasping under the heavy pressure of the Soviet Union." He said that it is regrettable that some countries intend to divide us" and prevent cooperation between Spain and other countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] US Congressman O'Konski submitted an amendment to the House of Representatives to include Spain in the list of countries in the Marshall Plan. The amendment will be voted on on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Burma Joins the United Nations; Approved by the Membership Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] The Security Council's "Committee to Approve New Members to the United Nations" agreed today to recommend that Burma join the United Nations. Representatives from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Ethiopia, and Ukraine all supported Burma's participation in the United Nations. The Argentine representative stated that he would reserve his opinion because he had not been instructed, and the French representative stated that he would temporarily support Burma's application because he had not been instructed. The committee therefore did not formally vote, and passed a report to the Security Council, stating that Burma already has the necessary qualifications to become a member of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>United Nations Organizes Jewish Provisional Government</h3>
<p>US Will Formally Propose a Truce in the Holy Land</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 30th] The United Nations Palestine Committee unanimously resolved on the night of the 30th to establish a Jewish provisional government in Palestine as soon as possible, and notified this matter in a letter to Shertok, the political director of the Jewish Agency. According to the committee, in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 29 last year, all possible steps should be taken to implement the partition of Palestine unless the Security Council orders otherwise, the committee will proceed accordingly. Earlier, according to a spokesman for the US delegation, US Chief Representative Austin will call on the Security Council on the 31st to call for a truce in Palestine. The committee's decision was only a few hours after the US delegation released this information.</p>
<h3>US Military Secret Meeting</h3>

<h3>Our Representatives Attend Four Committees to Discuss Various News Topics; British Representative Proposes More Detailed International Treaty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 29th Dispatch] In the past two days of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, in addition to the Coordinating Committee, which is in charge of the administrative work of the General Assembly, other four committees have also discussed various issues separately. The list of representatives from our delegation attending the various committees is as follows: (1) Chief Representative Zhang Pengchun, attending the Coordinating Committee; (2) Cheng Cangbo, attending the First Committee to study the basic tasks of newspapers, other reporting tools, the principle of freedom of the the press, and other general issues; (3) Deng Youde, attending the Second Committee to study the collection and dissemination of international news; (4) Liu Huoxuan, attending the Third Committee to study the free dissemination and receipt of news; (5) Ma Xingye, attending the Fourth Committee to study legal issues and draft charters. Liu Huoxuan, our representative attending the Third Committee, stated when the committee discussed the abolition of censorship today that China abolished news censorship after the end of the Great War. Democracy is a part of Chinese civilization, and the Chinese people enjoy freedom of speech and publication. Liu also said that we oppose any form of censorship, but if freedom of the press is required, the press itself must be responsible and should have morals.</p>
<h3>A Further Step in the Truman Doctrine; US Plans Military Aid to Europe; Military Lend-Lease Act May Be Restored</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Restoring military lend-lease measures to the UK and other countries in the Western European alliance has become a topic of discussion among officials and newspapers here. Secretary of State Marshall declined to comment on the matter last week, but said that the French government has repeatedly asked the United States to supply equipment. Some people here believe that the military lend-lease measure is the next stage in implementing the Truman Doctrine. The first stage of the Truman Doctrine was the start of the aid to Greece and Turkey in March last year; the second stage was the proposal of the Marshall Plan; the third stage was the establishment of the Western European alliance; the fourth stage was the United States' resumption of conscription and rearmament; and the fifth stage would be the supply of weapons to Western European countries to fill the vacuum caused by the lack of equipment.</p>
<p>Newspaper speculation is currently focused on military aid to France. Although the French army has 650,000 men, it lacks weapons and equipment. However, French embassy officials said that military aid is still too early before the countries of the Western European alliance have the opportunity to implement the details of their military alliance. Another unconfirmed report said that the US Department of Defense has plans to expand the British Royal Air Force, intending to help it with the latest US aircraft to make it the strongest defense force in Europe.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Geneva, 29th] Martin, chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, today read out the original text of the White House's press control to the Soviet Union at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press. The text, which is thousands of words long, subjects all newspapers, periodicals, photography, radio broadcasts, speeches, exhibitions, and films to the full control and restraint of the Minister of Public Education. After reading it, Martin said that a government that imposes such strict, thorough, and decisive control is hardly qualified to criticize the free press of any people. Soviet representative Romakin retorted, accusing American newspapers of attempting to spread obscene texts abroad, which caused the tide of young criminals in the United States itself. British representative Wicknell convened a conference to conclude an international treaty to ensure basic human rights and freedom of the press. The British draft is more detailed than the one submitted by the United States last week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 30th] Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov today accused the International Conference on Freedom of the Press of the existence of extremely strong dollar and pound censorships in Anglo-Saxon countries, which are exercised by the giants who own and control the newspapers. Bogomolov's remarks were in response to the remarks made by British representative McGuire at the meeting yesterday. McGuire pointed out yesterday that the fundamental difference between Soviet newspapers and the newspapers of Western democracies is that Western democracies would rather risk being criticized for their policies than take restrictive or repressive measures. As for the Soviet Union and Slavic countries, the opposite is true. They are unwilling to be criticized by newspapers and arbitrarily adopt repressive policies.</p>

<h3>Soviet Jewish Policy</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Wang Gongda</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Ankara] One of the biggest puzzles in contemporary world politics, and one that people across both hemispheres are pondering day and night, is "Why does the Soviet Union support the partition of Palestine?"</p>
<p>The joint support of the United States and the Soviet Union for the partition of Palestine became the number one miracle of the 1947 United Nations General Assembly. The United States and the Soviet Union are in diametrically opposed positions on every matter, every principle, and every issue. Only on the subject of partitioning Palestine do the United States and the Soviet Union consistently agree completely.</p>
<p>The United States' sponsorship of the partition of Palestine is undoubtedly significant, but within the United States, there is a large group of wealthy Jews whose economic power directly reaches the United States Congress, and their political power directly influences the 1948 United States elections. The U.S. government has seen through the weakness and incompetence of the seven small countries of the Arab world, so it has steeled itself to support the partition of Pakistan. (Note: The U.S. has now changed its position and advocates temporary UN trusteeship.)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's sudden decision to support the partition of Palestine was initially beyond the expectations of the world, because the past thirty years of Soviet history have indicated many reasons why the Soviet Union would not support this plan. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the one hand, the Soviet Union believes that the Jewish Zionist movement, known worldwide as "Zionism," is a running dog of British imperialism. The partition of Palestine directly facilitates the realization of the historical efforts of the Jewish "Zionist movement."</p>
<p>(2) For the past three years since the war, the Soviet Union has spared no expense in terms of huge amounts of money and manpower in order to manage the Middle East, striving to befriend the Arabs. Why would the Soviet Union offend the 40 million Arabs who own seven independent countries over the issue of partitioning such a small area of Palestine?</p>
<p>According to the reporter's observation, it can be determined that the Soviet Union's decision is to seek the near rather than the far, to be pragmatic, and to adopt a strategy of capturing the king to catch the bandits. The Soviet Union's decision has profound and subtle reasons, but they can still be inferred.</p>
<p>All the Soviet Union's propaganda towards the Arab world in the past three years has failed to achieve the desired results. The Arabs have deeply believed in Islam for 1,300 years, and Islam and Bolshevism are fundamentally incompatible. Moreover, among the seven independent countries in the Arab world, apart from the two smallest being republics, the rest include three constitutional monarchies and two autocratic monarchies. In other words, power in the Arab world is still concentrated in the hands of a small ruling class. The ruling class regards the Soviet Union as poisonous snakes and fierce beasts, and the Soviet Union cannot expect to make any progress in this regard.</p>
<p>Apart from relying on their belief in Islam as their only spiritual sustenance, the Arab people also have a large number who are nomadic. They do not live in cities, do not read books, do not read newspapers, and do not listen to the radio. Soviet propaganda has virtually no impact on them.</p>
<p>Disappointed, the Soviet Union thought of the Jews, who are ubiquitous, capable of anything, and always the first to take action. The future "Jewish state" will obviously, after its founding, first conquer the Middle East economically, then break through the millennium of slumber in the Middle East politically, and finally become a superpower in the Middle East by force. The Soviet Union decided to use the Jewish state as a stepping stone and the Jews as a vanguard to seize the Middle East. This is precisely the strategy of "capturing the king to catch the bandits."</p>
<p>There is a fact that can prove the progress of the Jews in the Holy Land, which is valued by Moscow's expansionists. As early as forty years ago (1908), when Lenin was in exile in Switzerland, he started the "Spark" newspaper in the Swiss capital, serving as the editor-in-chief, studying Marxism on the one hand and advocating proletarian revolution on the other. At the same time, the Jews in Palestine established the first "collective farm" in history.</p>
<p>As a result of discussions between the reporter and Middle East experts, it was determined that the "Jewish state" in the Holy Land will become the "best conductor" for Soviet propaganda and expansion in the future. In this way, the Soviet Union's decision to abandon its thirty-year-old theory (recognizing Zionists as pawns of British imperialism) and support partition in order to create a "Jewish state" actually has historical necessity.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is preparing to use Azerbaijanis to split Iran, to use Armenians and Kurds to advance into Turkey, to use Uyghurs to split Xinjiang, and to use Mongolians and Chinese Communists to split China. Now, with a parallel policy, it is using the Jewish people to deal with the "stubborn" Arab people.</p>
<p>For thirty years, the Soviet Union has successfully used a policy of exploiting small and weak ethnic groups to expand its territory, from East Asia through Central Asia to the Baltic Sea, all taking the same steps. The reporter tentatively calls it the "ethnic erosion policy" and seeks advice from domestic scholars on how to name this newest model in the history of aggression. British and American scholars have not yet had time to comprehensively observe this model of erosion.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union created the "Jewish Autonomous Region" in 1928 and renamed it the "Jewish Autonomous Oblast" in 1934. Before the Second World War, there were only 110,000 Jews in the oblast. During the war, 100,000 fled there. Therefore, the current Jewish population in the oblast is only over 200,000, which is equal to 4% of the entire Soviet Jewish population. The rest of the Jews in the Soviet Union still live in the plains from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and in the "Black Earth Belt" of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Jewish parents in the Soviet Union know the uselessness of Yiddish and certainly do not want their children to learn this useless, dead, ancient Eastern European dialect. Jews are also utilitarians created by history. All Jews in Russia speak Russian because they are afraid of imprisonment. Judaism has long been shelved, and the traditional Jewish festivals, rites, and music have all come to an end. Therefore, in terms of blood and culture, the Jews in Russia have been completely assimilated. (The End)</p>

<h3>Car Falls into River on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road; Tragedy Strikes the Family of Xi Debing on a Spring Outing</h3>
<p>Seven Men and Women in the Car Injured or Killed; Truck Escort Bravely Jumps into Water to Save Mother and Daughter</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A tragic accident occurred on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway the other day in which a car fell into the river, resulting in seven casualties, as reported in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. It is now known that the vehicle involved in the accident belonged to Xi Jiming, the brother of Xi Debing, Chairman of the Flour Guild of the Fourth District of this city and General Manager of the Fufeng Flour Mill, and former General Manager of the Fabric Bank. Xi Debing is a leading figure in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and has served as the director of the Central Mint and the general manager of the Fuxing Commercial Company. The other day (the 29th), as it was a holiday, he, his wife, and his wife's eldest daughter Ouyang Meisheng, her son-in-law Lu Hongjun, her youngest daughter Xi Yiyun, Xi Jiming and his wife, and Gu Gengchu, the general manager of the Sichuan Livestock Products Company, took three cars to Changshu for sightseeing. At about 11:00 a.m., they arrived at Chechang Bridge in Shuangfeng Town, Taicang County. The bridge was steep and narrow, with a high degree of inclination on both sides. The car carrying Gu and his family was in the lead and had already crossed. Just as the second car, driven by Xi Jiming, was driving up the bridge slope, a truck with the number Jiangsu Province Recovery Team 10310, loaded with empty oil drums from Zhenjiang to Shanghai, was also driving onto the bridge. Because they were both traveling at high speed, although the truck braked in time, Xi Jiming's car swerved to avoid it, crashed into the southern section of the railing on the east side of the bridge, and overturned into the river below. The current was swift and turbulent, and the car was submerged in an instant. At this time, the third car, in which Xi Debing was traveling, was a little further away. Zhao Xiaofang, a technician from the Recovery Team who was escorting the truck, saw the situation and immediately jumped into the river, groped open the car door, and rescued Xi Debing's wife and her daughter Ouyang Meisheng. They were first sent to Taicang Public Hospital for emergency treatment and were out of danger as of yesterday. When Xi Jiming was rescued, his face was already pale. As he did not improve after emergency treatment, he was sent to Shanghai for treatment, but he died due to lack of timely medical attention. The other four people in the car, driver Zhou Xifu, Xi Jiming's wife Sun Fenglan, Lu Hongjun, and Xi Yiyun, all died after being rescued due to insufficient rescuers. The corpses were examined by the Taicang District Court yesterday and will be transported to Shanghai for burial. Truck driver Xu Chengyu was also detained by the court for questioning.</p>
<p>According to local villagers who witnessed the accident, the driver of the car at the moment it fell into the river appeared to be a young man in a suit, while the driver was sitting beside him. Later, during the rescue, it was discovered that Lu Hongjun was holding the steering wheel. Lu had recently returned from the United States and had not been married for even two years. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred. They were riding in a 1947 Studebaker, a new car. After it overturned into the river, the wheels were still turning, and wooden pieces from the bridge railing were embedded in the engine. The car has now been salvaged by personnel sent from Fufeng in Shanghai together with the local police, but it is badly damaged. It is also heard that Xi Jiming and his wife Sun Fenglan did not originally intend to go to Changshu for a spring outing, but because there were still empty seats in the car, they happily took the trip, unexpectedly encountering this accident.</p>

<p>(2) Reviewing the results of the March rice allocation work, as of yesterday, the committee issued 4,418,000 large ration cards and 614,000 small ration cards. 264,009 ration cards were returned, so the actual number issued was 4,767,991. This number also indicates that the committee should supply more than 470,000 dan of rice this month. In reality, the total amount of rice distributed to various districts by land and rail this month reached 564,094 dan (including 405,694 dan of domestic and Burmese rice, and 158,400 dan of over-supplied rice from the Food Bureau). As of the deadline on the 26th of this month, a total of 460,658 dan and two dou had been sold, so there are currently 103,435 dan and eight dou remaining. The above figures indicate that more than 160,000 people in this city obtained rice ration cards but waived their rights, accounting for more than 3% of the city's total population.</p>
<p>More Payments Collected, Higher Shadow Interest Rates (3) The total amount of rice payments collected by the National Bank this month was 1,050,300,857,440 yuan. Based on the experience of the past month, the Civil Food Regulation Committee confirmed that the income from rice payments is closely related to the shadow interest rates in the market. The more payments collected, the higher the shadow interest rates. According to this month's statistics, since rice payments reached 500 billion yuan on March 8th, shadow interest rates began to rise. By March 25th, when payments reached 900 billion yuan, shadow interest rates had even exceeded 30%. Therefore, the Civil Food Regulation Committee hopes that citizens can purchase rice earlier in the month starting next month so that the National Bank can obtain rice payments earlier, tighten the money supply, and achieve the effect of suppressing prices.</p>
<p>Penglai District Has the Most Rice Shops (4) The distribution of rice shops in various districts of the city varies. According to the survey results, Penglai District has the most rice shops, while Xinshijie District has the fewest rice shops. Due to high rents, a large population, and few rice shops in Huangpu District, each rice shop needs to supply an average of 6,529 people, while each rice shop in Sisheng District only needs to supply 869 people, resulting in overcrowding at some rice shops. In order to improve this situation, the committee has decided to determine the amount of rice allocated based on the supply ratio starting next month to avoid overcrowding. (5) The April rice allocation has been gradually sent out. As of today, all 29 districts in the city can be reached, with only Xinjing District possibly being delivered tomorrow.</p>
<p>Eight Rice Shops with Unsettled Rice Payments (6) There are eight rice shops that have not settled rice payments to the National Bank of China for March: Dafeng Rice Shop in Zhenru District, Huaxingshun Rice Shop in North Railway Station District, Yongsheng Rice Shop at the end of North Sichuan Road, Shenxiangtai Rice Shop in Jiangwan District, Yuantaihing Rice Shop in Jingan District, and Maotai Fengji Rice Shop, Quanfutai Rice Shop, and Dalongzhongji Rice Shop in Changshu District in Yangjing District. Starting in April, rice allocation to the above rice shops will be suspended first, and a letter will be sent to the Financial Management Bureau to investigate the responsibility and transfer the case to the court for handling.</p>
<p>Oil Rationed per Capita, Set at 12 Ounces In addition, the meeting decided on the following matters: (1) The units responsible for household rice allocation (including rice industry, social service centers, and cooperatives) will await the deliberation of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. (2) The deadline for the second phase of rice allocation for industrial workers will be extended by ten days to April 12th, in accordance with the regulations, and a public announcement will be made in the newspaper. (3) The third phase of coal briquette allocation for industrial workers will be based on the number of people allocated rice in February. If any industrial units have applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to change their registration, the Social Affairs Bureau will notify the committee for handling.</p>
<p>Regarding the per capita allocation of cooking oil, it was decided that starting in April, it will be handled in accordance with the various established rules for rice allocation. Regardless of age, everyone will be allocated 12 ounces uniformly. Citizens will automatically choose an oil shop to purchase from. The oil allocation price will also be determined at 5:00 p.m. today, at the same time as the rice allocation price. Those who have not paid their oil payments for April will have their oil allocation suspended in April.</p>
<h3>April Allocation of American Rice, 15 Jin and 10 Liang per Dou</h3>
<p>It is learned that the city will allocate and sell American relief rice in April. Each municipal stone will weigh 156 municipal jin, which means each municipal dou will weigh 15 jin and 10 liang, which is 10 liang heavier than last month. The authorities still plan to maintain the rice allocation price for students in April at 800,000 yuan per municipal stone to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, the Civil Food Regulation Committee is currently allocating public addresses incompletely. It has found a new address at 7725 Nanjing West Road. Yesterday, the Sales Supervision Office, Audit Office, News Department, and Purchasing and Transportation Department moved to the new address to work. The Allocation Department will also move there after completing its backlog of cases. The office address of the committee's chairman will be located on the third floor of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Wife, Jealous of Husband's Affection, Hires Fellow Townsman to Kill; Woman Chopped to Death in Tianbao Road Field; Case Solved in Three Hours, Two Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Hongda, a native of Jiangbei, is currently a squad leader in the Hongkou District Office and resides at 42 Qimei Road. He married Wei Qingzhu, a fellow townsman, in his hometown of Lincheng. They have children. Later, Chen met Yang Huiqing, a woman from Dongtai, and cohabited with her at his home on Qimei Road. It is reported that Chen's first wife, Wei, recently came to Shanghai from her hometown due to unrest in the countryside and rented a thatched shed in Dade Lane on Gaoyang Road. Witnessing her husband's close relationship with Yang, she became consumed by jealousy. She paid Yan Zhaohong, a fellow townsman, 3 million legal tender and gave him an ax. At approximately 9:25 p.m. on the 29th, taking advantage of the darkness and sparse pedestrian traffic, she lured Yang Huiqing to a wheat field on Tianbao Road and used the ax to chop her head more than ten times. Yang cried out for help in extreme pain. Passersby heard the cries and reported them to the Tilanqiao Police Station. Deputy chiefs Huang Yinglong and Wang Xiwenzhen immediately ordered section chief Ma Zhuyu to lead section members Lin Jiyun, police chief Gong Tinghe, and others to rush to the scene. They found the woman's body in the wheat field, with more than ten ax wounds all over her body, a bloody mess. Her body was already stiff. An ax was left beside the body, and a letter was found in her pocket. Based on this clue, they rushed to 42 Qimei Road to investigate and learned that the deceased was Chen's concubine. They then investigated and found that Chen's first wife resided in a thatched shed on Gaoyang Road and believed that she was related to the case. They immediately went to investigate and found a letter from Yan Zhaohong in her pocket. She was immediately arrested. They then went to Yan Zhaohong's residence and found shoes stained with blood and two pieces of blood-stained clothing. He was arrested and interrogated. He confessed to the crime and revealed the whole story. The case was solved in about three hours from the time it occurred to the time it was solved, which can be said to be very fast.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Public Officials, Extorting Cotton Merchants, Two Arrested and Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jiang Lin and Wang Qianli were arrested by the police bureau for the crime of extortion and were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday for detention and investigation. Chen Rongbing, a cotton merchant in this city, who runs Rongchang Cotton Firm, was accused of being a traitor and aiding the enemy and is currently under investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office. Jiang Lin learned of this and also learned that Chen had hidden some property. He asked Wang Qianli to write a confidential report while impersonating an employee of the Municipal Government Investigation Office. He threatened and extorted Chen over the phone. Chen sent Qian Dianchen to negotiate, and Jiang demanded 6 billion yuan, saying that if he received the reward for the confidential report, he could get at least 1.5 billion yuan. Chen suspected his situation and checked with the Municipal Government Investigation Office and found that there was no such person. He realized that Jiang was impersonating a public official to extort money. Chen feigned compliance and agreed on 400 million yuan and reported to the police bureau. Jiang was arrested when he received the money, and Wang Qianli, who wrote the report, was also arrested. They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.</p>

<h3>Gangs Occupy Farmland, Farmers Request Prohibition</h3>
<p>On the farmland along both sides of the road between Zhongshan North Road, Jiaotong Road, and Hutai Road, more than a hundred hooligans suddenly captured bamboo poles, circled them with ropes, marked their strongholds, and built thatched sheds the other day. The farmers there, because it is time for spring plowing, believe that this behavior not only hinders their livelihood but also disrupts social order. They are rising up in resistance and jointly submitting a report to the relevant authorities, requesting that they be quickly prohibited and that the ringleaders be arrested.</p>
<h3>Special Court Prosecutors Take Office, Start Investigating Nine Cases Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wang Jiuzhang, Li Yulong, Zhu Cheng, and three other prosecutors from the Special Criminal Court have taken office and are actively preparing for investigation. It is heard that the cases urgently awaiting investigation include nine cases, such as the riot at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory and the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau by dancers from dance halls. The investigation is scheduled to begin tomorrow. If it is found that the facts of the cases do not comply with the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China during the Suppression of the Rebellion, they will still be transferred to ordinary courts for trial. The Shanghai Prison, fearing that the ideologies of prisoners in that court would affect the prisoners, refused to send prisoners there. It has recently obtained the detention center of the Penglai Road Police Station, which can hold about 100 people. The communist bandit underground organization case that was recently cracked has not yet been transferred to the Special Court.</p>
<h3>Prison Guard Embezzles, Sheng Ziqiang Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sheng Ziqiang, a prison guard at the Shanghai Prison, who resides at 39 North Sichuan Lane, North Sichuan Road, extorted year-end bonuses from prisoners Fei Rongchang, No. 2440, and Yao Deyun, No. 4762, in late December of last year. However, both prisoners had no money on them, so they wrote notes to their families, instructing Sheng to go to the prisoners' homes to collect the money. Yao Deyun also asked Sheng to bring three injections of 606 medicine to his home. After the notes were written, Sheng went to the prisoners' homes, demanding 1 million yuan for each as a year-end bonus, and brought three injections of 606 medicine. However, Sheng embezzled the money and medicine. The Shanghai Prison authorities quickly learned of this and detained Sheng, transferring him to the local court for trial on charges of corruption. The case was publicly tried for the first time in the Criminal Court No. 8 by Judge Mei Erhe yesterday. The defendant pleaded guilty in court, but claimed that it was only for safekeeping and that he did not embezzle it. As a result, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for investigation and then retried.</p>
<h3>Thief Hidden in Hotel, Eight Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Qiu Shirong, who runs a tailor shop at No. 7 Emei Road, Hongkou, dispatched partners on the 15th to transport a large batch of Western suits and woolen fabrics via Xin Zha Road. While passing Tianliu Road and Sichuan Road, they were unexpectedly followed by fast-horse thieves, who seized the opportunity to steal a portion of the fabrics, valued at approximately 160 million yuan.

<h3>General Chennault on American Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyrighted by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department.</p>
<p>(4) The Strange Phenomenon of 1944</p>
<p>If America's policies during the war against Japan had achieved their stated goals in China, there would be no question of helping China resist Communism now. China would have already become Communist.</p>
<p>I am not saying that this was our direct and intended purpose in China, but I sincerely believe that this would have been the logically inevitable result.</p>
<p>The main point of the policy implemented by the United States in our military alliance with China over these three years was to increase the demands on the Chinese central government, reaching a peak in 1944, almost to the point of forcing this government to step down.</p>
<p>At the same time, those implementing our policy were constantly engaging in a kind of "open flirtation" with the rebellious and autonomous Chinese Communists, hoping to arm them with American weapons and bring them to fight the Japanese in the Chinese areas of the National Government—at a time when the commander of the Chinese National Army was not lacking manpower but was demanding American weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>And there was news that the Communists had expressed a willingness to hand over the direct command of the Communist forces to our theater commander, General Stilwell. This news was not obtained within the scope of my official duties, but it is reliable. If the Communists had indeed offered such a plan, I have no doubt about their ultimate secret purpose, which was nothing more than to seize power in the Chinese areas of the National Government.</p>
<p>This was the unfortunate situation in September 1944 before Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek rejected America's final and greatest demand, forcing the United States to recall Stilwell. For nearly three years, Stilwell had constantly and firmly demanded that the Chinese army be completely managed by American officers, up to the rank of colonel.</p>
<p>As far as I know and believe, apart from Stilwell's strong desire to open a land route through Burma, this well-conceived plan was a good example of the long-term planning initiated by Stilwell and his staff.</p>
<p>We will talk about the failure or lack of planning of American military planning in China, and the crisis caused by American demands, later. For now, let us consider the phenomenon of the so-called "open flirtation" between the American command in Chongqing and the Chinese Communists.</p>
<p>In 1944 and before, the Communist Party of China in the so-called "border region" of northwestern China established a delegation in Chongqing as a superficial cover for cooperation with the anti-Japanese central government. In fact, this delegation was little more than an intelligence-gathering agency and a propaganda center.</p>
<p>Until after the day of victory over Japan, American planners began to use this agency to conduct negotiations aimed at incorporating the Chinese Communist Party into the central government. Before that, the main task of the Communist delegation seemed to be news liaison work. Although it has never been publicly stated, the press's attacks on the "dictatorial" central government mostly came from the Communist delegation in Chongqing, which is an ironic commentary.</p>
<p>In addition to this bizarre method, the American theater staff later added another—that is, the establishment of an American military delegation in Yan'an. The only possible defense for this action is to provide military intelligence in an area that itself clearly lacks military intelligence.</p>
<p>But the American delegation in Yan'an did more than just provide intelligence. It made it easier for the Communist Party to learn about our military measures and allowed American journalists and State Department personnel stationed in our theater staff in China to go to Yan'an from time to time to promote the Communist Party's claims.</p>
<p>With the convenience of air traffic between the Chongqing theater command and Yan'an, it was quite easy for anyone to travel to this Communist Party exhibition area with a suitable excuse. In the past, the Chinese government has always disapproved of such unofficial contacts, especially contacts with journalists, but at that time there was very little way to interfere.</p>
<p>If the American delegation in Yan'an was indeed a source of valuable intelligence, this intelligence was really lacking in confidentiality. If the confidentiality of this intelligence was necessary, I feel that there is a gap between reality and necessity.</p>
<p>An officer reported to me that when he went to the Chongqing press conference once, he learned that the Communist Party quite "liked" Stilwell to lead their army. If this report is correct, it is surprising that such a delicate matter cannot be kept a little secret, to an extent no less than the intelligence itself.</p>
<p>If one wants to argue that the American delegation in Yan'an does provide convenience in intelligence, then Stilwell's successor, Wedemeyer, believes that this agency is not needed, which is a sharp rebuttal. I suspect that the significance of this delegation is not limited to putting more pressure on Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, although the delegation and its jointly cultivated pro-Communist and anti-Chiang rhetoric undoubtedly provided assistance and comfort to thorough Communists.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a joke circulating in Chongqing that the American command staff was drafting "a private foreign policy, with John Davies (a staff member of the State Department stationed at Stilwell's command) as Secretary of State."</p>
<p>In 1944, another unhealthy argument in American policy in Chongqing was seen in the various rumors about American embassy staff member Jack Service and others, who were accused of passing important confidential documents to Communist sympathizers. Service was later declared innocent.</p>
<p>But before this happened, a lower-ranking staff member of Stilwell's staff had said that the charges against Service were creating a "second Tukhachevsky Affair." He predicted that Service's defense would be to establish an argument that he was only implementing "old pressure" on the Chongqing government according to Stilwell's policy.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ski Troops in Swaddling Clothes</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Dihua on the 24th by airmail] While the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green in the Central Plains, the high-pressure cold air from Lake Baikal has added more spring snow to the silver-clad northern Xinjiang. What beautiful spring snow on the tidal sea! It was during this snow flurry (on the morning of March 7th) that more than 300 people, the second batch of ski cadres trained by the Fifth Military Officer Training Class in Dihua, graduated.</p>
<p>Six Weeks of Ski Training. This batch started on January 28th of this year and trained for six weeks. The first batch started on November 24th of last year and graduated on January 12th of this year. In total, more than 710 ski cadres have graduated and become junior and mid-level officers in the garrison troops in northern Xinjiang and the Hexi Corridor.</p>
<p>During the six weeks of training, they need to learn some knowledge of snow and extreme cold warfare. They must learn various ski skills, such as "straight downhill," "diagonal downhill," "mountain skiing," "cross-country skiing," "snowplow skiing," as well as "falling," "obstacle crossing," and "sledge marching." As for various patrol and shooting methods in the snow, as well as shooting and destruction techniques while skiing, they must lay the foundation in these six weeks. They are not only skilled but also technically proficient, and they can train their subordinates when they return to various troops. It is reported that many soldiers in the National Army stationed on Beita Mountain are learning to ski. Therefore, we can say that the Dihua Officer Training Class is the cradle of Chinese ski cadres, and the new Chinese ski troops will gradually grow up from swaddling clothes.</p>
<p>Not only Xinjiang, but also the whole of China, had never had ski troops in the past. Although ski instruction was held when Japan occupied the Northeast, and the government continued to do so after the victory, there was no expansion or large scale. Therefore, running ski training in Xinjiang can be said to be completely without precedent, and everything depends on self-creation.</p>
<p>Prices, Equipment, and Teaching Materials. According to the reporter, the people in charge of this ski training are really racking their brains. There were no finished products for various ski equipment, and there were no workers specializing in manufacturing such tools. So, they had to use local materials and use workers who had repaired snowboards in the past to manufacture according to the drawings. In a very short period of time, various tools such as "skis," "poles," and "sleds" were enough for more than 400 people in a class to train skiing. Secondly, there was the problem of instructors. Since the Ministry of National Defense could not send anyone, and there were no such experts to hire in the interior, they had to select some skaters or people who had learned to ski in the past (in cold regions, skiing and skating are sister sports loved by the general public in winter), and then refer to books to study, learn, and correct them, and solve the problem of instructors in a crash course manner. And of course, there are no such books in China, relying on only a few foreign reference books, requiring them to be adapted to the environment of Xinjiang, compiled and translated, and then printed and distributed. Now, books such as "Snow and Extreme Cold Warfare," "Training of Ski Troops," "Use of Ski Troops," and "Cold Region Warfare and Training" are almost available to every trained ski cadre.</p>
<p>Once, when the reporter went to see General Yi Jin, who was in charge of the actual training—the deputy director of the officer training class—he specifically pointed out that the difficulty in running ski training was the problem of three materials—talent, equipment, and teaching materials, which were the most difficult to solve but must be solved. And they finally overcame these subjective and objective difficulties in the spirit of Whampoa and skied through this road themselves!</p>
<p>Logging and Manufacturing Tools. Now is the time when spring is approaching and the snow is melting. Once winter arrives and every winter thereafter, it will continue to be held, and there is no doubt that the scale will be expanded and the training will be more advanced. It is reported that they are currently logging wood in Nanshan, which will be processed and manufactured into ski tools by local arsenals to prepare for winter training this year and distribution to various troops. Why did Chairman Chiang personally order the local military academy to run ski training? We can very reasonably realize this reason: in Xinjiang, north of 43 degrees north latitude, winter lasts for four or five months, and the temperature difference between day and night is as large as ten to fifteen degrees Celsius, and the cold is biting. Still remembering the winter of the 33rd year, when the National Army first entered Xinjiang, they encountered unprecedented extreme cold, so that many soldiers were "half dead from artillery fire and half died on the side of the road." This is a vivid historical lesson; and in order to strengthen the national defense line of the continental cold zone, in order to overcome the difficulty of marching when the snow is more than 30 centimeters thick and infantry, cavalry, and even armored tanks cannot move, although the Changbai Mountains and the Xing'an Mountains have the natural conditions for training ski troops, they are still in a state of constant warfare. Therefore, the area between the Tianshan Mountains and the Altai Mountains is the best place to train ski troops.</p>
<p>Snow Gang Exercise Results. It was a day of wind and snow, and the first ski training class had an exercise. The local military leaders were invited to visit, and the reporter also rushed to enjoy a visual feast, praising each and every one of the national defense athletes. General Song Xilian, the military commander of the entire Xinjiang and the director of the officer training class, also showed a satisfied smile from time to time.</p>
<p>The exercise site was on the side slope of Snow Gang. The first subject was "straight downhill," which is a basic method for rapid movement when encountering mountain side slopes. Then, "diagonal downhill," "mountain turning," "obstacle crossing," "straight downhill with guns and objects," and "falling with guns and objects" were performed one by one, becoming more and more exciting. Even more tense was: "Bang!" The downhill shooting performance began again. This is where the ski students wear "ski boards" on their wrists with "poles," hold guns in both hands, load the chamber, aim and shoot, and eject the cartridge, while descending on a slope of twenty or thirty degrees! "Snap! Snap!" Light machine gun downhill shooting was also practiced. Although there were only hypothetical defeated people, the situation was tense enough, and my heart was beating "thump! thump!" It is said that the technical skills of the cadres trained in the second phase are even more advanced, and they can ski on one foot, and cross-country ski for more than 50 minutes and ski more than 8 kilometers!</p>
<p>In order to increase the interest of cadres in learning to ski, General Song Xilian once tried skiing on the snowfield, but unfortunately fell and dislocated his left arm, which took more than half a month to heal. Although this gave General Song physical pain, it gave the national defense athletes on the snowfield unparalleled inspiration!</p>
<p>Two Ski War Histories. After visiting the exercise, I embarked on my return journey. On the way, I silently thought about the sister sports of skiing and skating. My mind was dancing, wishing that all our men would jump into the snow and wilderness. I thought of the fact that it is now the Arctic era, and when everyone is going north, the continental border of our national lifeline is in the cold zone. I suddenly remembered two ski war histories:</p>
<p>During the First World War, Germany fought France. Originally, it wanted to attack from the south through Switzerland and from the north through Belgium. Later, the German Emperor traveled to Switzerland and saw the Swiss people skating and skiing, moving quickly, while Germany had no such training at all. Therefore, Germany abandoned its plan to attack France through Switzerland.</p>
<p>On November 30, 1939, the Soviet army began to attack Finland's Nai Karri Lien Ismathu. The Finnish army laid out "winter roads" and used ski troops to attack the Soviet army at any time. By mid-January, the war ended. The Soviet army suffered a total of 36,000 deaths, and all supplies were captured by the Finnish army. The Finnish army only had 2,000 participants, and the total number of deaths was only 150. This is the miraculous feat of the ski troops. (Mei Ran)</p>

<h3>Main Culprit in Dayong Massacre, Tian Mingyuan, Has Gone to the Mountains</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Changsha on the 25th by airmail] Lake Province Committee member Wang Yuying and others were previously sent to Dayong to thoroughly investigate the Huang Yingchuan massacre. The matter has been completed, and they returned to Changsha on the 25th. After Wang arrived in Changsha, he received a telegram from Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Headquarters, summoning him to Wuhan to discuss important matters. Without even warming his seat, he took a car to Wuhan.</p>
<p>Wang's trip to Yong lasted more than 20 days. Regarding the investigation, he is drafting a detailed report. The main point is that on the day he arrived in Yong, he immediately tried his best to restore local order. He ordered that the assembled militia and civilian guns be disbanded by March 13th. Initially, a small number of armed forces remained in the area five miles from the city, waiting to see what would happen. After strict orders to comply, the militia returned to farming and the civilian guns were disbanded in December, and the order of the entire county was immediately restored, and all agencies resumed normal operations.</p>
<p>As for the main culprit in the massacre, Tian Mingyuan, before Wang and others arrived in Yong, he had already fled in fear of punishment with more than ten guns. Later, he joined Wu Zhengqiu, the main instigator of the incident, and dragged away more than 70 civilian guns, and fled with him to Yian Township in the county, joining the giant bandit Feng Ying, and partnering with Liang Yongqing, the bandit leader of Yongshun. Currently, they have hundreds of people and guns, lurking in the triangle area in the mountainous area bordering Yongshun, Sangzhi, and Dayong. The garrison security forces have been ordered to actively suppress them.</p>
<p>Wang finally said: Although the general order of the county has been restored to normal, those with civilian guns are still guarding against each other, so the hidden dangers that they have suffered before are of great concern. Wang said that he has ordered the new county magistrate Liu Xin to personally inspect the townships and towns, and earnestly promote the removal of the source of chaos.</p>
<h3>Because of "Haunted House No. 13," Descendant of Prince Zheng Sues for Defamation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Beiping on the 29th] The film "Haunted House No. 13" has caused a storm because its plot involves the death of the descendant of Prince Zheng of the late Qing Dynasty and his son. Zhao Xu, the descendant of Prince Zheng, now renamed Jin Shaoxun, inherited the title of Prince Zheng. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhengting returned the Xishiku debt on behalf of his mansion in Xinpi Ku Hutong, Xicheng. The mansion belonged to China University. According to the value, there was still a surplus. Jin also donated to China University, and the school hired Jin as a school director. According to Jin, "Haunted House No. 13" describes Prince Zheng's Mansion, pointing out that Prince Zheng's Mansion is a haunted house, and most of the facts are fabricated and deliberately defamatory. Jin has hired lawyers Liang Qiyao and Kuai Jinfu to request a ban on the screening from the relevant parties and file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. The North China Service Office of China Electric has also hired a lawyer to protect its rights.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper in Changsha on the 26th by airmail] Communist bandit Li Yun, from Suqian, is 35 years old this year.

After "review," it was decided to remove him from the post of county magistrate.</p>

<h3>Cultural Relics, Old Books, Writing Brushes</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziqing</p>
<p>In recent months, in addition to news of wars, murders, and education crises, the crisis of old books has also been a lively news topic in the newspapers of Peiping. Furthermore, the cultural relics of Peiping, mainly ancient buildings, have always been valued. The government has established a Peiping Cultural Relics Preservation Committee and has allocated several not insignificant sums to repair these relics. In early February, this committee also held a meeting and decided, in order to adapt to Peiping's long-term plan as an auxiliary capital, to request the government to "approve the first half-year's budget" and "strengthen the management and use of cultural relics buildings to maintain ancient sites." As for writing brushes, the Ministry of Education stipulated many years ago that students must use writing brushes for Chinese composition and for answering examination questions in Chinese. However, in reality, students rarely use writing brushes, especially in large cities. This issue still seems to be pending. In the author's view, cultural relics, old books, and writing brushes are all of a piece; they are all legacies, history, and old culture. Those who advocate preserving these things inevitably have some "ancient sentiments," and on the one hand, they also inevitably have some sense of "preserving national essence." "Preserving national essence" now seems to have become a bad word, equivalent to "clinging to remnants and defending shortcomings," "being inflexible with the ancients," "being infatuated with bones," and "letting the dead hold back the living." The author also knows that most of those who advocate preserving these old things today are figures from the May Fourth era and would no longer have such stubborn thoughts, and the author himself shares their feelings to some extent and does not consider himself to be so stubborn. However, upon careful analysis of the reasons for this advocacy, apart from "ancient sentiments," it seems that one can only say that it is "preserving national essence," because these things are the excellent achievements of our ancestors and are therefore worthy of preservation, and they will also evoke our nostalgia. What distinguishes us from the older generation should be that preservation is only for preservation's sake, allowing these things to be like fossils, no longer妄想them to revive. What should pass will always pass, and we understand this principle.</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of large sums of money to repair and paint the ancient buildings of Peiping, there has been criticism in one newspaper, seemingly saying that in this era of war and famine, one should not be busy with these things to whitewash peace. Originally, if there were genuine peace, this renovation might also attract some foreign tourists and obtain some foreign exchange to use. Now, in these times, that glorious scene is only a strong contrast, a strong irony, to the reality of war and famine, which does indeed make people feel a little shocked. This is naturally a utilitarian view, but in these times, there are too many people without clothes and food, and a utilitarian view is also natural. However, having said that, there is no comprehensive plan for the use of public funds now. If this money is not used here, it probably will not be used for those who are without clothes and food, and it may even be used for some irrelevant things. In that case, using it to preserve antiquities is not so bad. If it were truly possible to plan comprehensively and distinguish between priorities, this kind of thing should probably be postponed. Although the author also agrees with preserving antiquities, he does not have the intention of rescuing them. Logically, it is not too late to preserve antiquities after having enough food and clothing; if it is too late, it can only be regretted, as food and clothing are always fundamental. The author disagrees with excessively emphasizing the preservation of antiquities, excessively emphasizing Peiping as a cultural city, but "strengthening the management and use of cultural relics buildings to maintain ancient sites" does not require spending much money and is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The crisis of old books refers to woodblock books, especially large volumes. The old book business has been very depressed for the past year, and some shops are selling large volumes of woodblock books by the pound to make 還魂 paper. This is naturally very regrettable and a bit tragic. Therefore, some scholars have come out to call for rescue. Now the Ministry of Education has allocated 1 billion yuan to purchase these old books, and rescue has already begun, which is naturally very good. However, the author wants to point out that the crisis of old books has been lurking for a long time and is not sudden. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, lithographic editions of ancient books were popular, which were convenient to carry and reasonably priced. This was really the beginning of the crisis of old books. However, at that time, lithographic editions were not considered elegant; it was said that there were many typos, which was true, but the main reason was that they lacked the antique charm. Therefore, adults and gentlemen did not patronize them. However, after all, they were reasonably priced, convenient, and did not take up shelf space, so general scholars, especially young people, were happy to buy them. Since the Republic of China, there have also been photographic reprints of books, and large volumes such as the Sibu Congkan were almost all based on good editions, and photographic reprints did not have typos or lack antique charm. This had an even greater impact on the sale of old books. Later, the Sibu Congkan also had micro-reprints, which had less antique charm but were even more convenient. There were also typeset editions of ancient books, such as the Sibu Beiyao and the Wanyou Wenku, which were also convenient and reasonably priced. And like the Guoxue Jiben Congshu, which followed some of the lithographic methods and punctuated the sentences in the books, it was even more convenient. Before the War of Resistance, there were also so-called "80% discount books," which were typeset with not too many errors, were extremely cheap, and circulated in large quantities, and many young students patronized them. Compared with the earthen paper books during the War of Resistance, these 80% discount books have now become good editions. Today's young students often prefer these typeset editions to woodblock editions; they want convenience and do not care about the antique charm. Since people who buy large volumes of books can buy photographic reprints or typeset editions, people who buy single volumes of books are even more happy to buy typeset or lithographic editions. The innovation of art has destined the decline of woodblock books! In the future, when micro-film books are developed, the current photographic reprints and typeset editions of large books will also decline, right?</p>
<p>As for writing brushes, their fate seems even worse. Compared with "ballpoint pens," their inconvenience is even more obvious. To use a writing brush, you need an inkstone and ink, or at least an ink box or ink boat (Shanghai has this thing, shaped like a small boat, I don't know what it's called, using ink paste, packed in toothpaste-like tubes, squeezed out when used), which is not as convenient as a ballpoint pen, and you can't hang the brush on your lapel or clip it in your pocket. More importantly, writing with a writing brush is much slower than writing with a ballpoint pen, which is the fatal flaw of the writing brush. In terms of price, the writing brush, along with the attached accessories, and considering the short period of use, is not necessarily much cheaper than a ballpoint pen. Good imported ballpoint pens are naturally very expensive, but good writing brushes are not cheap either. Recently, someone in Peiping saw pens priced at more than 10 million yuan at Dai Yuexuan. Naturally, ballpoint pens require foreign exchange, and even those made in China require materials to be bought from abroad, while writing brushes are domestically produced; but we must strive to make ballpoint pens also domestically produced. As for the fact that the Ministry of Education used to stipulate that students should use writing brushes, it seemed to only focus on "preserving national essence" or "native culture"; students did not pay attention to this at all, and more and more people used ballpoint pens. Modern life needs ballpoint pens, which is inevitable and reasonable, and the empty name of "native culture" cannot resist this. Writing brushes should be preserved, and it is enough to let a small number of calligraphers and painters preserve them. Forcing everyone to use them will not work. As for the fact that students' writing is not good now, it is because they have not been seriously trained, which has nothing to do with not using writing brushes. A student's writing is good if it is clear and neat, whether they use a ballpoint pen or a writing brush.</p>
<p>Students do not like to pay attention to handwriting, nor do they like classical Chinese and ancient books—although there are those who buy typeset editions of ancient books, but not many. They have a lot of homework and are busy, so they cannot appreciate the art of calligraphy, and they even neglect the function of writing, only seeking speed and writing unclearly, making it difficult to recognize. Because classical Chinese and ancient books are difficult and hard to understand, they also feel that it is not worth the effort to read them. Fundamentally, it is because they do not value history and old culture. This is also an inevitable process, and we do not need to be surprised. However, we must make young people write clearly and neatly to fulfill the basic function of writing, and on the one hand, we must strive to compile some ancient books with clear and detailed annotations in both vernacular and classical Chinese for young people to read. We should critically accept history and old culture as part of the material for creating a new culture, and it is wrong to obliterate it all at once. In fact, young people do not really obliterate classical Chinese and ancient books all at once. Just looking at the fact that there are already eight vernacular translations of Guwen Guanzhi, and there are already three of Tang Poems Three Hundred (although only one is relatively good), we can know that the need for this kind of book is still great—and the buyers are probably mostly young people. So we should know the direction of our efforts. As for the art of calligraphy and specialized research on classical Chinese and ancient books, it is better to leave it to a small number of people who are interested, and universities or independent colleges should cultivate these people.</p>
<p>Connected to this, I thought of the reform of Chinese painting and Peking opera, and there are people working hard on both of these tasks now. The other day, a young colleague talked to me about these two issues, and he felt that Chinese painting and Peking opera have already been fully developed and have become stereotyped, so there is no need to reform them, and there is no way to reform them; forcibly reforming them will probably only produce some things that are neither old nor new, and the results may not be good. He felt that folk art was originally immature and had not been developed, so we might be able to promote its development. Like Chinese painting and Peking opera, which have already reached their peak, it is time for them to decline and pass, and trying to pull them is probably ultimately a thankless task. In the author's opinion, the creation of our new culture and new art must critically adopt old culture and old art, both the art of the scholar-officials and the folk art can be used, and foreign art can also be used, but they must be based on this era and this country. Reform is probably inevitably dragged by the old era, and it will not go far, and perhaps it will not be able to move at all. It is better to start a new stove, but the old materials can be selectively used. What should pass will always pass.</p>

<h3>Hubei to Use Education Funds to Aid Needy and Outstanding Students; Gansu Plans to Raise 2.5 Billion to Award Needy Students</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Baoding, 30th] Hubei Province will thoroughly aid all needy and outstanding students in public and private schools throughout the province by using two methods of distributing church funds and interest: (1) The existing education fund of 3 billion will be extracted in three installments to purchase and store goods; (2) The interest on the fund will be distributed to needy and outstanding students reported by each school in proportion, but the amount received by each person cannot exceed two-thirds of the public expense students' allowance; (3) Public expense students will not be aided.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Lanzhou, 30th] The Gansu Education Department's Poverty-Stricken Student Scholarship Committee recently raised 2.5 billion in scholarships. In addition to the provincial government bearing 900 million, the Provincial Bank and Provincial Trading Company each bear 800 million. The distribution issues were discussed today.

<h3>University Education is Not Compulsory Education; Full Public Expense is Impossible; Ministry of Education Requests Opinions from Jiaotong and Zhengzhi Universities on Major Issues</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated: National Jiaotong University and National Zhengzhi University recently telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that all self-funded and semi-public expense students be given full public expense or special subsidies. This is impossible in both theory and fact. Higher education is not comparable to compulsory education; no country has an example of the government providing all meals for university students. In our country, students in schools above the junior college level who enjoy public expense treatment have reached one-half of the total number. Before March, the government's financial burden accounted for 25% of the education funds managed by this Ministry. After the monthly adjustment of the salaries of public school teachers and staff in April, the supplementary food expenses for public expense students must also be increased monthly, and the required amount of funds is still difficult to estimate at this time. This kind of expenditure directly increases the burden on the national treasury and indirectly reduces the enrichment of school teaching equipment. It is not only inconsistent with educational principles, but it is also not a policy that the government is willing to adopt. In response to the requests from Jiaotong University and Zhengzhi University, this Ministry will issue a cordial telegram to inform the staff and students. If this leads to trouble, it will be severely punished without leniency.</p>
<h3>Government Approves Over 10 Billion in Subsidies for Private Universities and Colleges</h3>

The Ministry of Education has issued orders to inform each school and requested the national treasury to issue the funds directly.</p>
<h3>Inspector Huang Zengyue Returns to Beijing to Discuss the Educational Situation in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Displaced students in Shenyang have been accommodated</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Huang Zengyue, the director of inspectors of the Ministry of Education, who was dispatched to the Northeast to inspect education, returned to Beijing on the 30th. According to him: (1) Public schools at all levels in the Northeast are able to remain calm and continue teaching despite the tense situation and difficult living conditions, which is commendable. (2) Having inspected the area last year and returning this time, I witnessed that each school was able to comply with the Ministry of Education's previous orders for improvement, which is very gratifying. (3) There are quite a few middle school students from various provinces in the Northeast who are displaced in Shenyang. I have discussed with the directors of the education departments of various provinces and cities to find ways to accommodate them in youth middle schools. Educational figures in the Northeast in Beiping and Shenyang exchanged opinions with me many times on the future education problems in the Northeast and expressed their excitement about the Ministry of Education sending personnel to express condolences at this time.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Shenyang, 30th] Liu Shuxun, the president of Dongbei University, told our reporter that the request to relocate the school was only the opinion of the students, and the Ministry of Education did not give any instructions.

<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Shenyang, 30th] The Dongbei University is in better shape than before. 2,300 students have registered. When the reporter visited Dongbei University today, he saw that the Lin Garden had already revealed spring colors, and songs were still being sung at the edge of the war.</p>

<h3>How to Earn Respect?</h3>
<p>— Zhou He</p>
<p>Written for the 7th Normal Education Movement Week</p>
<p>Today's teachers want equal status with civil servants to protect their treatment, and they want to increase tuition fees or teacher appreciation funds to maintain their livelihoods. If they charge parents a few extra dollars, the school is called a "school shop" and said to be illegal, because merchants can raise prices at will, while teachers must "serve the public and abide by the law." Therefore, in recent years, even if normal schools waive tuition fees and subsidize meals, there are still not many applicants. Even those who are willing to apply are mostly female. The teaching profession is not respected to this extent. What is the reason for this? In my opinion, there are probably three:</p>
<p>Lack of Respect for Teachers First, because now, as long as teachers have some knowledge, they can become teachers. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, more than half of the national teachers have not received teacher training. Usually, ordinary middle school graduates can qualify after serving for one year. Thus, people who become officials after leaving their jobs, or who fail in business, become teachers. Since it is so easy to become a teacher, you can do it, and I can do it, so people no longer value teachers.</p>
<p>Second, I want to talk about the current normal education. Generally speaking, graduates of normal schools should teach very well. But in fact, this is not the case. Ordinary teachers teach this way, and normal school graduates also teach this way. Even in middle schools, most teachers who graduate from education departments lack specialized skills. Apart from administration, they cannot be teachers. As a result, the status of teachers has declined even further, and it is conceivable that they are not respected.</p>
<p>Third, in recent years, the path of studying has long been ignored. Children spend so much money from elementary school to university for sixteen years before they can graduate. Even if they graduate, they do not necessarily have a way out. It is better to change plans early and teach children to learn business, open shops, and do business, so that the economic situation can be improved. Therefore, in the eyes of parents, school teachers are unimportant. If you really want your children to study, you can hire a teacher to come to your home. Fortunately, the cost is very low, only slightly more than a servant.</p>
<p>Not Teaching Books, But Teaching People From this, it can be seen that the lack of respect for teachers is indeed justified. If we want to persuade people to respect teachers, we must make everyone willingly respect teachers. The best way is to make them feel that teachers are as indispensable as rice, and that the education of their children must rely on teachers to have hope. Therefore, if we become teachers, we must not follow the traditional concept. The work of ordinary teachers is only to teach books, regardless of whether students are male or female, healthy or weak, intelligent or not, they do not care about anything. So everyone can teach. Now we want to abolish textbooks, abolish the same old textbooks, and teach with people as the object. Then everyone can rely on their own talents and develop their own abilities. In this way, teachers are indispensable, and normal school graduates are indispensable. Secondly, the method of teaching people now must also be changed. In the past, teaching books was considered good as long as you had knowledge, rich materials, and detailed explanations. Now, teaching people means teaching people to learn by themselves, so learning should be turned into an activity. In learning activities, teachers are in a guiding position, like the chairman of a meeting or the leader of a trip. Therefore, an excellent teacher must have a new concept of children and know how children learn in order to be competent. The result of this kind of teaching will definitely be very good, and parents will be happy to send their children to school. The status of teachers will naturally increase. Finally, we know that the center of ancient education was entirely in the family. Parents in the family were like nannies, lawyers, judges, and teachers. Since the industrial revolution, the organization of the family has changed, and women have also gone to society to find jobs. Therefore, children must be sent to school, and the school has replaced the family and become the center of education. The responsibility of teachers, in addition to knowledge, is also to guide various issues such as occupation and marriage. This is a matter of course, but we are disappointed with modern schools. Teachers in modern schools do not ask about anything except academics. The academics obtained in this way have become the decoration of life, which may or may not be there. If not, which parent would not be willing to entrust their children to teachers? Because the teacher I am talking about lives with children all day long, and is an expert in guiding children on various issues.</p>
<p>Just imagine, the work of modern teachers is no longer teaching books but teaching people. Those who are taught truly gain learning, and this learning completely solves various problems in life. These problems cannot be taken care of by any parent. Only schools, only teachers in schools, can take on this task. Then, how can parents not respect teachers, and how can teachers not increase their status in society?</p>
<p>Now, if we want to promote normal education, we should guide normal students well, starting from this.</p>
<h3>Zhou Dayun's Consecutive Accurate Shots: Qingbai Reverses Defeat Against Allentate</h3>
<p>US Navy Suffers Defeat 37-43; Qingbai Trails by 12 Points in First Half</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The US Navy Allentate basketball team took to the court again at 7 pm last night against Qingbai at the Municipal Gymnasium. In the first half, the visiting team led 22-10 and seemed invincible. Little did they know that Qingbai would have a turnaround, eventually reversing the defeat with a score of 43-37. Qingbai trailed by 12 points, 10-22, in the first half. The game drew over a thousand spectators who were all delighted. Zhou Dayun's shooting for Qingbai, with repeated accurate shots, attracted the most attention from the audience. He should be given the most credit for this victory. Allentate's Stone Fuller and Edson were still very active. Qingbai only began to surpass in the third quarter, and continued the momentum in the final quarter, leaving the visiting team helpless.</p>
<p>Allentate Dominates Initially The game started at 7 pm. Allentate's Stone Fuller broke the ice. Qingbai's Zhou Dayun quickly scored two goals, taking the lead. From then on, it was the visiting team's world. Allentate's lineup, besides Stone, consisted of Edson, Haggreen, Allen, and Stann, the same original lineup. Qingbai's lineup was Zhou, Xu Heng, Ma Canxi, Cai Yanxiong, and Chen Xianglong. The first quarter ended with a score of 8-5. When the second quarter continued, Qingbai called two timeouts, which could be described as a sign of poor performance. Chen Qingjiang once replaced Xianglong with, and Zhang Shaoqing replaced Dayun, but the situation was still difficult to resist. The first half ended with a score of 22-10, with Allentate dominating for a time.</p>
<p>Qingbai Team's Turnaround In the third quarter, Dayun resumed his prowess, opening fire left and right upon contact. Xu Heng and Yanxiong both seemed like awakened lions, and Dayun's shooting was so smooth that they actually surpassed with a score of 29-28. Allentate replaced Haggreen with Kuras. The quarter ended shortly after the substitution was completed. In the final quarter, Qingbai's momentum and luck were both thriving. The opponent replaced Stone Fuller with Crawford. Through everyone's efforts, Qingbai took the lead all the way. Zhou and Cai's shots sometimes had unexpected gains. The visiting team's Stone re-entered the battle, but it was of no avail. The final score was 43-37. Qingbai came from behind, with a skillful victory.</p>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for National Games Athletes: Half Price for Trains, 20% Discount for Ships</h3>
<p>The National Games Organizing Committee previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Communications requesting preferential price reductions for athletes from all over the country to come to Shanghai. Yesterday, the committee received a reply from the Ministry of Communications, approving half price for trains and 20% discount for state-owned ships. Car fares remain full price. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"The case of your committee's letter of March 2 stating that the 7th National Games will be held in Shanghai on May 5, and that you request that athletes and officials from all over the country be issued reduced or free round-trip travel certificates, according to previous practice, to facilitate the journey, etc. has been approved. It has been found that the current transportation agencies are suffering from losses and cannot afford to reduce prices as they did before the war. After two merchants have offered concessions, trains can reluctantly offer tickets at half price, and state-owned ships offer a 20% discount. Car fares remain full price. Priority purchase convenience will be given to train, ship, and car tickets. By way of assistance, from April 11 to June 10 of this year, the official letter from your committee or participating agencies and schools will serve as proof, and will be limited to one round trip."</p>

<h3>A Prodigy of Long-Distance Running in North China: Introduction to Liu Jingkun: Qingdao's Champion is Working Hard, Hoping to Show His Talents at the National Games</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao Airmail] Japan has ten long-distance running prodigies. If we talk about the top ten long-distance runners in China today, Liu Jingkun of North China should be one of them. But according to the reporter's humble opinion, Liu Jingkun is already among the top three in today's long-distance running talents. There is no problem in scoring points at this year's National Games. If given the opportunity, he and Lou Wenao will become the two gems of Chinese long-distance running.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu showed his talent among long-distance runners early on, but due to difficult living conditions, he worries about firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day and never takes athletes as a career. He is currently serving in the 9th Regiment of the 208th Division of the Youth Army. He does not have super nutrition, and at the same time, due to his duties and environmental conditions, he lacks scientific training, but the hope for the future is great. Therefore, the reporter has written a short article to introduce him.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu is from Weixian, Shandong Province, and let Qingdao. He is 27 years old this year, 1.70 meters tall, and weighs 56 kilograms. During middle school, his 800-meter time was 2 minutes and 6.7 seconds, and his 1,500-meter time was 4 minutes and 20 seconds. In the Sino-American Games in Qingdao last autumn, his time was 4 minutes and 21 seconds, which was several hundred meters away from the second place, so the result was not satisfactory. Last year, in the Beijing Games, his 10,000-meter run was 24 minutes and 10 seconds, several laps away from the second place, which was also unsatisfactory. A few years ago, Mr. Liu's 5,000-meter time was 16 minutes and 25 seconds. In one game, not accustomed to the high temperature above 100 degrees, the veteran Gong Zhenglin won first place, with a time of more than 17 minutes, which also felt regretful.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 35th year, Mr. Liu ran the 10,000 meters in Qingdao with a time of 33 minutes and 15 seconds, breaking the national record. At this time, Mr. Lou Wenao ran more than 33 minutes and 40 seconds in Shanghai. Since then, new results have been seen, and today he has created a highest record of 31 minutes and 27 seconds. The progress is truly amazing. And Mr. Liu has no rules for practice. Qingdao has no suitable sports field for practice, so there are no accurate records. The opening of the National Games is approaching. At this time, Mr. Liu has become the target of various parties, which is quite difficult. This shows that it is not easy to be a pure amateur athlete. The other day, the Qingdao City held an 8,000-meter cross-country race. Mr. Liu led all the way and took first place with ease. His posture is excellent, and he is a natural talent. Today, Mr. Liu visited the reporter at his residence and said that he decided to participate in the National Games. He will follow the reporter's advice to take care of his affairs and then start practicing. The official practice must be in the afternoon to adapt to the hot and humid climate of Shanghai in mid-May. He hopes to get a hard-earned one-month progress schedule, and hopes that the advanced people in the domestic sports world will help him. (Shen Zhi)</p>

<h3>Strengthening Control of the Financial Market: Short-Term Treasury Bills to be Issued Soon; Monthly Interest Set at Five Percent; National Bank Fully Prepared</h3>
<p>The Central Bank is actively preparing for the issuance of short-term treasury bills. Once the Ministry of Finance announces the regulations, the bills are expected to be officially issued within about two weeks. It is understood that there is no fixed total amount for these treasury bills. Instead, the Central Bank will issue them as needed, with terms of approximately one, two, or three months. The monthly interest rate is set at five percent, and the bills will be issued at a 10% discount. Banks, money shops, and the public will be able to purchase them, and they can be used as collateral and security.</p>
<p>The significant meaning of issuing treasury bills lies in adjusting needs and absorbing floating capital. In the past, the absorption of floating capital was mostly done through the sale of materials. Now, the Central Bank can also use treasury bills to tighten credit at any time and place. Therefore, in terms of strengthening control of the financial market, it is like adding a new force.</p>
<p>In other news, the government's issuance of short-term national treasury bills was formally approved by the Executive Yuan last week. These national treasury bills will be in denominations of 10 million, 50 million, 100 million, 500 million, and 1 billion. The terms will be one, two, or three months. The interest rate will be a monthly rate of five percent, and the Central Bank will be entrusted to issue them at a discount in the open market at any time according to actual needs. The amount of issuance will also depend on the needs. The Central Bank has made full preparations and will issue them immediately upon receiving the order. National banks, commercial banks, and people of all social classes can purchase them, and they can circulate freely in the market as a means of payment. The purpose of this issuance of treasury bills is entirely to control the market, tighten credit, and achieve the goal of absorbing floating capital. In the past, the government's issuance of US dollar treasury bills and the sale of gold could absorb floating capital, but the price paid was extremely high. We cannot repeat the same mistakes. We are specifically adopting a high-interest policy and issuing short-term national treasury bills for sale in the open market, increasing the Central Bank's tools for controlling the market. Because they can be issued at any time, and issuance can be reduced when credit is tight and increased when credit is loose, it is planned to recover 200 billion or 300 billion legal tender by issuing 200 billion or 300 billion treasury bills. This puts us in a proactive position to control the market, unlike government bonds, which are passive. The original interest rate was a monthly rate of five percent, which is far from the market interest rate, so it is issued at a discount. The amount of the discount increases the interest. Under the current circumstances, the price paid is not high, which is more cost-effective. Certain economic authorities believe that the Central Bank has this tool, which can indeed recover floating capital and achieve the goal of controlling the market and tightening credit.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] According to information from the Central Bank, the principal and interest of maturing US dollar treasury bills will be paid in national currency at the Central Bank's foreign exchange rate on that day. The rumor that they will be paid with the soon-to-be-issued short-term treasury bills is not true.</p>

<h3>Sugar Recovers</h3>
<p>Sugar has been falling since last Friday, reaching its lowest price. By Saturday, Taiwan sugar had rebounded by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. During the holiday, informal trading saw small fluctuations. Yesterday, the municipal guild marked up the price again, showing further increases. Spot 24 coarse white was 4.7 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan from last Saturday. Semi-white was 5 million yuan, up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. 20 medium sugar white was 4.4 million to 4.7 million yuan, up 270,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Local sugar also followed suit, rising. Swatow refined blue opened at 2.925 million yuan, then rose to 3.05 million yuan, up 250,000 yuan, with an estimated 500-600 bags. Xinghua white ordinary was 4.3 million to 4.5 million yuan, Xing red was 2.98 million to 3 million yuan, with an estimated 500+ baskets. Diao Qing rose 250,000 yuan, opening at 2.7 million yuan for 300+ bags. Hainan, with very little inventory being moved, was still difficult to recover, trading at 2 million to 1.95 million yuan for about 200 pieces, which can be said to be the lowest price.</p>
<h3>Joint Sugar Transport to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiaoren ship returned to Shanghai from Kaohsiung the day before yesterday, carrying over 22,000 bags of sugar. Also, the Linsen ship arrived at the port from Kaohsiung yesterday, also carrying over 26,600 bags of sugar.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>Since the varieties of black, green, and scented tea have been dwindling, sellers are not inclined to loosen their grip, and the supply in the market has become even scarcer. However, asking prices are soaring, and although buyers are aware that both domestic and foreign sales are good, they feel that they cannot get what they want at the moment and are taking a wait-and-see approach. Throughout the day, supply and demand gradually decreased, and the trading lacked distinguishing features, with little price movement. Prices were mostly similar to last week.</p>
<h3>Soap Weak</h3>
<p>The soap market for daily necessities is weak because credit is still tight, hidden interest rates are unusually high, and buyers lack the ability to take deliveries. In addition, prices are inverted compared to other cities, causing customer concern. There are even returned goods being sold off, resulting in abundant inventory in the market. Although factory prices have increased, local dealers rarely accept them. Sentiment is depressed, and asking prices weaken after an initial increase.</p>
<p>By the close, Guben Soap had fallen by 110,000 yuan compared to before the holiday (27th), closing at a low price of 5.74 million. Huang Xiangmao, Guanghua, and others also fell by about 100,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>Trading among match dealers was not smooth, and only the Meili Phoenix and Erlao brands rose by 500,000 to 200,000 yuan, respectively. The prices of Xiong brand matches varied. The kerosene and candle markets were both stable, but trading was sparse.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Over Supplied</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market opened weak. Trading inside the exchanges was sparse, and dealers bought little additional stock. The month-end tightness of credit further depressed the market. Sellers were more inclined to sell quickly and in large quantities. There were also fellow dealers from Hankou and other places selling off stock, and a significant amount of stock was also transferred between dealers. Rumors that the US exchange rate would be lowered further eroded confidence. The market trend was downwards. Lastly, the ten-pack of British American Tobacco cigarettes was priced low to 99.5 million yuan at close, a sharp drop of 3.5 million yuan compared to before the holiday (27th). Old Knife Tobacco also dropped by 2.5 million, closing at 79 million yuan. Among the Chinese brands, banks, brandy, double axes and white horses sold relatively well, holding up the market. Other brands mostly dropped from 1,000 to 15,000 yuan, while American cigarettes and canned tobacco fluctuated.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Procurement Price Adjustment</h3>
<p>The Committee for Reviewing and Determining the Prices of Important Export Goods, jointly organized by the Export Control Administration, the China Trust Bureau, the Four Banks Joint Office, and four other units, was established on the 13th of this month. Its first decision was to set the tung oil procurement price at 6.5 million yuan per standard picul. So far, more than 700 piculs have been purchased. However, since the foreign exchange rate was adjusted from 195,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan, the price of tung oil has risen to 7.9 million yuan. To adapt to the changing environment, the committee held a special meeting on the 30th, resolving that the procurement prices for Shanghai and Wuhu be adjusted to 7.5 million yuan, and for Guangzhou to 8 million yuan, effective today.</p>
<h3>Declining Prices Reported from Production Areas Depress Market Sentiment; Rice and Flour Prices Decline; Oil Cakes and Miscellaneous Grains Share Weakness</h3>
<p>The rice market declined because declining prices were reported from Wuxi the day before, depressing market sentiment. In the morning, sellers still called for the original prices, but there were few inquiries. Finally, due to weak local demand and limited sales, the market could not hold its ground, and sellers had to lower prices to attract customers. Both the North and South markets fell by 100,000 yuan compared to the close last week. White geng rice was 3.5 million in the South market and 3.6 million in the North market. Nangang rice shipments were high, and the price declined more significantly, with early and thin rice each falling by 150,000. The people's food allocation committee sold early rice in the North market at a price of 3.3 million yuan, but there were few buyers. The South market did not sell any.</p>
<p>Amidst the decline in rice prices, flour also saw a sharp drop, especially since prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were weak, causing sellers to be nervous and sell off stock. There were few inquiries from North suppliers, and local retail sales were also stagnant. The market opened with a decline, with the central market being the weakest. Prices recovered slightly at the close, but all brands were down by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Bingchuan flour opened at 1.425 million, falling to a low of 1.415 million, but recovered to the opening price at the close. Hongfeng and Jiancheng were both down by 60,000+ yuan, with the former entering the 1.4 million range. Large-bag bran fell sharply by 40,000 to 50,000.</p>
<p>The prices of miscellaneous grains varied, but most were weak. Soybeans opened very stagnant, and the price barely held its ground. Later, Swatow suppliers bought slightly, pushing up higher-quality goods by 20,000 to 30,000. Dou beans fell by 40,000 to 50,000. Although Qingdao suppliers bought some corn, they did not buy much, so the price fell by 60,000 to 70,000. Selected Qing was difficult to sell, and the price dropped by 40,000 to 50,000. Mung beans and red sorghum saw little trading and the market was weak. Red beans were stable. Raw peanuts, influenced by Guangzhou suppliers, initially rose by 400,000 to 500,000, but later weakened due to oversupply, finally rising by 300,000 to 400,000.</p>
<p>Due to the decline in rice prices and other miscellaneous grains, the edible oil market was weak. Moreover, prices in Wuxi and other places were low, causing widespread uncertainty. Local shops rarely added stock, and sellers, finding it difficult to sell, voluntarily lowered prices. Oil mills also offered lower prices. Datong soybean oil opened at 7.45 million, falling slightly to 7.35 million at the close. Tongfeng soybean oil even fell slightly to 7.3 million at the close. Both were down 150,000 to 200,000. There was a large supply of raw oil, and prices fell sharply. Qingdao Jitong raw oil closed at 8.75 million, a drop of 400,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil also fell sharply by 400,000, and raw rapeseed oil and clarified oil were down by 200,000 each. Bean cake was not bought by suppliers, and the price dropped by 20,000 to 30,000.</p>

<h3>China Trust Bureau to Purchase Frozen Eggs</h3>
<p>To be Exported in Mid-April</p>
<p>In view of the sunny weather in recent days, the rush of fresh eggs, and the decline in prices, the China Trust Bureau will negotiate with the frozen egg industry on the 30th, agreeing to a transaction price of 6.6 million yuan per picul, continuing to purchase the second batch of frozen eggs for the year, totaling 504 tons, with each ton valued at 2.204 billion yuan including packaging.</p>
<p>It was also learned that another third batch of frozen eggs, totaling 500 tons, is planned to be purchased within 12 days. It is expected that around 2,000 tons will be collected, ready to be loaded onto British ships after mid-April. As for how much of the first batch of frozen eggs, 705 tons, ordered by the bureau on March 19th, will be delivered, a decision will be made today.</p>
<h3>Newsprint Declines</h3>
<p>The authorities' handling of materials imported with self-provided foreign exchange is coming to an end. Among these materials are approximately 6,000 to 7,000 tons of various types of paper, of which Canadian and Swedish newsprint account for nine-tenths. In recent days, paper merchants have been rushing to the authorities to complete purchase procedures. Once completed, they will be able to supply the market, so yesterday the market price of American newsprint dropped sharply by 200,000 yuan per ream compared to before the holiday (27th), closing at a low of 4.65 million yuan. Double-sized paper also fell sharply by 150,000 yuan per ream. Other Western white, glossy, typing, and kraft papers also experienced significant declines ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 or 600,000.</p>
<h3>Rayon Declines; Factory-Made Yarn Soft; Silk Goods Fall</h3>
<p>Rayon prices declined yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand glossy rayon opened at 194 million yuan. Supply and demand were relatively balanced, and the price briefly rose to 200 million yuan. The noon close was 197 million yuan for immediate payment. In the afternoon, the price fell to a selling price of 90 million yuan, and the final price was 91 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory-made yarn was slightly soft yesterday. D-grade yarn was priced at 308 million yuan, C-grade five-dan split yarn traded at 310 million yuan, and high-quality small lots traded at 305 million. Thousand-count yarn saw very little trading, and asking prices were also slightly softer.</p>
<p>Silk goods fell yesterday. Huaqiang Zhensi quilt covers opened at 120 million yuan. It was then heard that the stock market had declined, causing market sentiment to soften, and asking prices fell frequently. By the close, the price had dropped to 114.5 million yuan for immediate payment. Trading of Dachenge checkered crepe was extremely limited. The closing price was 440,000 yuan. For other goods, factory prices mostly did not change, but market prices were slightly softer.</p>
<h3>Frequent Negative News; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline; Purchase Orders for Textile Construction Sold Cloth Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market was weak. Prices had risen too much before the holiday, it was the end of the month, credit had not loosened, and customer demand turned sluggish. The local market was dull. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 7 million immediately after opening above the 200 million yuan mark. Subsequently, rumors that the foreign exchange rate might be lowered further eroded confidence, and with the general decline in non-industry goods, bulls competed to sell off and shorts seized the opportunity to become active. The market quickly saw an oversupply, and prices plummeted to 187 million yuan.</p>
<p>By the close, some shorts covered their positions, pushing the price back up to the 190 million yuan mark. It closed at 190 million yuan, a drop of 17 million yuan compared to before the holiday (27th). 21-count Double Horse yarn saw a lot of selling, falling to a low of 114 million yuan at the close, a massive drop of 20 million. Other coarse and fine yarns, such as 20-count, 16-count, and 32-count, also fell by about 10%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with frequent negative news, causing widespread unease. Rumors that the foreign exchange benchmark price might be lowered caused those with floating profits to rush to sell off, and dealers released stock. Local suppliers only made a few purchases in line with the approved purchase orders. Only Shanxi suppliers slightly absorbed stock. The market was weak and spiritless.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.32 million yuan, gradually falling to a low price of 4.23 million yuan. Dye factories slightly took advantage of the low prices, and the price recovered slightly to 4.3 million yuan at the close, a drop of 100,000 yuan compared to before the holiday (27th). Other fine cloths also fell by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, but the market remained weak after the close, with Dragon Head fine cloth trading at 4.25 million yuan. Approved purchase orders actually had to be discounted by 50,000 yuan, with sales made at 4.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, Double Flying Dragon fine cloth initially traded at 3.75 million yuan, and finally closed at 3.85 million yuan. Four Gentlemen poplin and straight-grain fine twill color fabrics, shilin cloth, etc., fluctuated.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sold Cloth</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Textile Construction Company opened its cloth sale as usual yesterday, selling a total of 3,040 bolts of cotton cloth and 100 bedsheets. Purchase orders decreased compared to before, with only 34 orders, of which all but 7 orders from factories purchasing 1,520 bolts were purchased by cloth shops.</p>
<p>In other news, Textile Construction Company supplied 17 types of cotton cloth, including 2 types of bedsheets and 20-count and 21-count B-grade Dragon Head fine cloth, priced at 3.75 million yuan. Yuan poplin and straight-grain fine twill have not yet been opened for sale, and there are few purchase orders.</p>
<h3>Textile Industry Hopes Authorities Consider Increasing Tax on Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] According to people in the local textile industry speaking to our reporter: It is reported that the financial authorities are scheduled to increase the consolidated tax rate on cotton yarn from 7% to 10% starting on April 1st. On the surface, this is only an increase of 3%, but in reality, calculated as a percentage, it increases by more than 42% compared to the original tax rate.</p>
<p>The cotton consolidated tax was originally calculated based on the price of yarn. As the price of yarn rises, the consolidated tax paid also increases accordingly. If the tax rate is further increased, it is like both increasing the base salary and calculating it based on the cost of living index, which is something the textile industry, now in a precarious state, cannot afford.</p>
<p>Textiles are the only sector of the national industry that has a solid foundation. After the victory, the textile industry seemed to be booming due to the surge in demand for clothing. Some people believe that it should not be difficult for the textile industry to bear a heavier burden, and even some government officials may think this way.</p>
<p>However, the industry has long been exhausted of financial and material resources after eight years of war. After the victory, the prices of raw materials soared, and the proportion was even higher than that of finished textile products. Therefore, the textile industry can never restore to its pre-war state.</p>
<p>In addition, the industry has made significant sacrifices to support the government's price stabilization and control policies. Most factories are now facing a crisis. The government should start by reducing taxes to support light industry, so that the industry can prosper, which will indirectly increase the country's tax revenue. Taking a "killing the goose to get the eggs" approach and increasing the tax rate regardless of the consequences will directly increase production costs, weaken purchasing power, threaten the survival of the textile industry, indirectly increase the burden on the people, and stimulate price increases. This is not a proper policy. It is hoped that the wise authorities will consider this.</p>
<h3>Ample Supply of Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] It is widely rumored that there will be a shortage of raw cotton supplies, and some manufacturers are even worried about having to shut down their factories. According to reliable sources, the government has already made preparations for the supply of raw cotton. Yesterday, officials from the Central Bank announced that more than 80,000 bales of American and Indian cotton will arrive in Shanghai in the coming weeks. In addition, a total of 210,000 bales of American and Indian cotton have been ordered to be shipped in April and May, and the ordering of large quantities of American and Indian cotton to be shipped in June and July is ongoing. Therefore, there is definitely no problem with the raw materials for the textile industry.</p>
<p>Hubei Cotton Merchants Return to Hankou</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Hubei cotton merchant delegation previously contacted the Yarn Control Committee to negotiate the purchase of cotton, aiming to quickly secure a large amount of raw cotton.</p>
<p>It is now learned that the Hubei cotton merchants, in support of this policy, acknowledge that if they are entrusted with the purchase, they are willing to provide full collateral for the working capital they receive, but they request to receive the funds and deliver the cotton in Hankou.</p>
<p>The Yarn Control Committee stated that all terms, except for receiving cotton outside the designated areas, will be handled in accordance with the contract signed with Shanghai cotton merchants.</p>
<p>The delegates Cheng Ziju, Lin Houzhou, Yuan Boxian, Wang Heqing, and others have returned to Hankou together to convene a general meeting of members to report on the results of the negotiations, and will then come to Shanghai to sign the contract, in order to quickly purchase a large amount of cotton for the government.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Loan Amounts in Various Regions Determined at Loan Assessment Meeting</h3>
<p>The Salt Loan Review Committee of the Four Banks Joint Office held a meeting in the conference room on the second floor of the Bank of China at 10:00 AM yesterday (30th), chaired by Cai Gongzhuang, and passed 20 motions. The most important of these was the allocation of loan amounts for salt in various regions for this year. The total loan amount for salt this year is 1 trillion yuan, with 700 billion allocated for marketing and 300.1 billion for production.</p>
<h3>Actively Preventing Bank Draft Bounces: Financial Management Bureau is Investigating the Cause, Strictly Enforcing No Cashing of Same-Day Checks</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Municipal Financial Management Bureau, told reporters yesterday: The bureau is still regularly inspecting the operations of banks and financial institutions. Generally, the operations of banks and financial institutions are considered normal. As for the number of bounced checks, it currently accounts for about two percent of the total amount exchanged, which cannot be considered a large amount. However, the bureau is actively investigating the cause of bounced checks to determine whether the fault lies with the customers or the banks themselves, and then take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Another report: The Financial Management Bureau is researching ways to prevent bounced checks, thoroughly investigating the causes. If the responsibility lies with the bank, it will be punished accordingly. If the responsibility lies with the customer, the bureau will investigate their intentions and impose effective sanctions. It was also stated that the bureau strictly enforces the rule that same-day checks cannot be cashed.</p>
<p>Another report: The Financial Management Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, requiring special study of bounced checks in the city's banks and financial institutions. It stipulates that any depositor found to have bounced three checks will be warned and have their account closed. Similar penalties will be imposed if bounced checks occur at three different locations or three different banks simultaneously, with no leniency. Yesterday, the Financial Management Bureau specially assigned the Economic Crime Division to jointly investigate the matter.</p>

<h3>Brief Notes on Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Dai Bufan</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The "Opening Remarks" (入話) in storytelling (also known as "Victorious First Chapter," 得勝頭迴, equivalent to the "Preface" 開篇 in ballad singing 彈詞) often have sources. For example, the "Opening Remarks" in the 33rd chapter of "Slapping the Table in Amazement" (拍案驚奇), "Zhang Yuanwai Righteously Fosters an Orphan, Bao Longtu's Wisdom in Joint Documents" (張員外義撫螟蛉子，包龍圖智) is from a piece by Zhang Yong (張詠) in "Records of Distinguished Ministers of the Song Dynasty, Former Collection" (宋名臣言行錄前集) (compiled by Zhu Xi 朱熹), Volume 3: "When Lord Zhang Yong was in Hangzhou, a wealthy man on his deathbed, whose son was only three years old, instructed his son-in-law to manage his wealth, leaving a letter to his son-in-law, saying: 'If you wish to divide the property in the future, give three-tenths to the son and seven-tenths to the son-in-law.' When the son grew up, a lawsuit arose over the property. The son-in-law presented the letter to the court, requesting that the original agreement be followed. Lord Zhang Yong read it, poured wine on the ground, and said: 'Your father-in-law was a wise man. He entrusted the son to you because he was young. Otherwise, the son would have died at your hands.' He ordered that three-tenths of the property be given to the son-in-law and seven-tenths to the son, and they both wept and thanked him before departing. (Tombstone 碑) '—Note: The above is excerpted from the original Ming Chongzhen Zhang Song engraved edition. A small "Tombstone" character is attached to the end of the text. This matter is presumably recorded by Zhu Xi from Zhang Yong's tombstone."</p>
<p>The above plot is the same as what is said in "Slapping the Table in Amazement." However, the latter changed the will to:</p>
<p>"Zhang Yi Fei, is not my son, the family property should all be given to my son-in-law, outsiders are not allowed to compete for it." (一張一非我子也家財盡與我婿外人不得爭佔一)</p>
<p>Due to the different ways of reading (punctuation), the magistrate judged it accordingly.</p>

<p>Regarding the source of storytelling and novel themes, Mr. Zhao Zuìshēn has worked diligently and has almost found the "natal home" (娘家) for all the stories in "Three Words" (三言) and "Two Slaps" (二拍). I think, if someone finds the "natal home" of these storytelling "Opening Remarks," wouldn't it be more interesting?</p>
<p>The source of "Opening Remarks," in addition to applying stories from previous books as mentioned in the previous section and arbitrary fabrication by storytellers or writers, seems to also involve excerpting the storytelling of predecessors. For example, the "Opening Remarks" in the 27th chapter of "Slapping the Table in Amazement" narrates the story of Wang Congshi losing his wife when moving house and later reuniting in Quzhou, which is roughly the same as the 10th chapter of "Nodding Head Stone" (石點頭), "Wang Ruren's Separation and Reunion of the Fish Dream" (王孺人離合團魚夢). It seems that "Nodding Head Stone" and "First Slap of Slapping the Table in Amazement" were both products of the Chongzhen era. I don't know if "Slapping the Table in Amazement" deleted "Nodding Head Stone" or if "Nodding Head Stone" elaborated on "Slapping the Table in Amazement"? However, the most likely hypothesis is that this Song Dynasty story was originally a Song Dynasty storytelling; contemporary authors would probably not take other people's works to delete or elaborate on, but must have seen the things of the predecessors and adapted them.</p>

<p>Regarding the 36th chapter of the "First Slap of Slapping the Table in Amazement," "The Lazy Monk in the East Corridor Summons Demons, The Black-Clad Thief Commits Adultery, Murder, and Killing" (東廊僧怠招魔，黑衣盜奸生殺), Mr. Zhao Jingshen said it was from "Taiping Guangji" (太平廣記), "Collection of Strange Tales" (集異記), etc. (see "Casual Talks on Novels," page 234). But I also found the same record in Volume 3 of the "Former Collection of Records of Distinguished Ministers of the Song Dynasty." It records Xiang Minzhong (向敏中) (whose courtesy name was Changzhi 常之, he served as Prime Minister during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong 眞宗): "When the Duke Xiang Minzhong was in Xijing, a monk asked a villager for lodging one evening, but the owner refused. The monk asked to sleep in the carriage outside the door, and the owner agreed. At night, a thief broke into the villager's house, helping a woman and her clothes over the wall to escape. The monk happened to be awake and saw this. He thought to himself, 'Since the owner didn't allow me to stay, and now the owner has lost his wife and property, he will definitely arrest me and take me to the county official tomorrow.' So he fled in the night, running into the wilderness and falling into a well. The woman had already been killed by the thief and was already in the well. The next day, the owner searched and found the monk in the well, arrested him, and tortured him. The monk falsely confessed, saying, 'I had an affair with my daughter-in-law and lured her away to escape. Fearing that she would be discovered, I killed her and threw her into the well. I lost my footing in the dark and also fell in.' The stolen goods were lost by the well, and he didn't know who took them. The case was closed, and the report was sent to the prefecture, but the prefecture didn't suspect anything. Only the Duke (referring to Xiang Minzhong) suspected that the stolen goods had not been recovered and interrogated the monk several times. The monk confessed, but said that he was destined to be responsible for this person's death in a previous life. The Duke persistently questioned him, and he finally told the truth. The Duke secretly sent an official to visit the thief. The official ate at a village shop, and the shopkeeper asked him if he came from the government office, not knowing that he was an official. She asked, 'What about the monk?' The official said, 'He has already been wrongly judged. Even if the thief is caught, he will not be questioned.' The old woman said, 'It doesn't hurt to tell you; the woman was killed by a young man in this village.' The official asked, 'Where is he?' The old woman pointed to his house, and the official arrested him there..." Isn't this exactly the story of "The Black-Clad Thief Commits Adultery, Murder, and Killing"?</p>
<p>Zhu Xi was a person of the Song Dynasty, and the "Records of Distinguished Ministers" he compiled would certainly not be untrue. Therefore, "The Black-Clad Thief Commits Adultery, Murder, and Killing" is truly a "story about public cases"! But, I don't have "Taiping Guangji" and other books on hand, otherwise, comparing these two "sources" would be interesting.</p>
<h3>Border Town Landscape Painting</h3>
<p>— Yao Shenji</p>
<p>During the eight years of separation and chaos, so many people were kicked west and then kicked east. No one knew where they would end up. This year, fate arranged for me to go to Longling.</p>
<p>Longling is a border town in western Yunnan. It takes six or seven days by car from Kunming, passing through countless fields and villages, crossing the large iron bridge over the Nu River, and finally driving the car at full power to climb over the peak of Gaoligong Mountain. The road underneath is relatively convenient; just drive the car straight down the mountainside, and you can reach Longling.</p>
<p>Looking from afar, this city surrounded by towering mountains is just a desolate empty city. Walking in, you realize that it contains infinite excitement. The whole city has only one main street, with shops next to each other, and many stalls, with goods piled up like mountains, mostly colorful cans. These are all milk, coffee, Indian black tea, and British cigarettes imported from Burma. The shops also operate the exchange of "Rupees," with Burmese and English signs. Many shops have record players, constantly playing lively music, which is so pleasant and so charming.</p>
<p>Before coming, I had heard many absurd legends, saying that this place was already a miasma and rainy area. When I arrived, I realized that the mountains here are also green, the water is also beautiful, with lush forests and verdant rice paddies. The countryside is full of pleasant greenery everywhere. The language and clothing of the people are also the same as ours. They work diligently in the fields; some are doing business in an orderly manner, warmly greeting customers. Looking at this peaceful and tranquil scene, I also settled down with peace of mind.</p>
<p>This place just has too much rain, especially during the rainy season, it almost never stops raining for a day. When you go out, you clearly see a good day, but a heavy rain suddenly comes on the way, pouring down on you without warning. You always have to carry a raincoat and umbrella, and always wear a pair of galoshes on your feet. However, the rain falls very quickly, not as lingering as "Xiao Xiang Night Rain" (瀟湘夜雨). After a burst of heavy rain, a patch of azure sky is immediately revealed, and the sun smiles at the people on the road again. It is said that Longling's rain, Xiaguan's wind, and Baoshan's women are the three wonders of the Yunnan-Burma Road. I don't know how fierce Xiaguan's wind is or how beautiful Baoshan's women are, but I have experienced the power of Longling's rain.</p>
<p>In the past, the population was probably sparse. Once the Yunnan-Burma Road was opened, this small town became more and more prosperous day by day. Many rear-area institutions and companies set up stations and offices here. In addition, there were banks, post offices, tax bureaus, and checkpoints, resembling a prototype of a city. People, like the mud and sand in the Yellow River, all flocked to this place. Among them were a few "fools" who really served for the War of Resistance, and most of them were smart gold prospectors who came to fill their own pockets. New buildings were added every day, and countless city signs swayed in the wind. No business was bad; some signs had not even been hung up yet, and customers had already poured in. There are no electric lights here. For the convenience of supplying oil from Burma, every household has gasoline lamps, which are more lively at night than during the day. Waking up from a dream in the middle of the night, you can still hear the trucks roaring on the road.</p>
<p>Most of the people living in this city are wanderers thousands of miles away from home. They feel a little lonely in their hearts, and when they are free, they gather in coffee shops to pass the time. Fortunately, everyone is a fellow traveler in the world, and it is easy to get close when talking. At first, they only nod to each other, but after a long time, they greet each other like old friends. There are no movies, no dramas, and no famous attractions here. Apart from eating, there is almost no enjoyment of life to speak of. But the food that is available is so little, mostly canned food imported from abroad. Only one kind of "Erkuai" (餌塊) can be considered a local specialty, a bit like fried rice cakes in the Southeast, and the taste is indeed delicious. It is said that during the Qianlong period, a general who led troops to conquer Myanmar was hungry in Longling one night. Someone fried a portion for him, and he ate it with great satisfaction. When he returned, he asked the emperor for a reward, which the people of Longling are very proud of.</p>
<p>Here, you don't see many women. There is a young girl in a small restaurant. This girl has not received any education and is not very beautiful. She has some freckles on her face. In the city, no one would pay her much attention, but in this place without women, she is praised like a princess. Many people rush to her house to eat, just to peek at the smile lines on her eyes. A college student who counts money in the bank once wrote her a "Hu Shih style" love poem with his accounting pen. Later, this woman became the wife of a driver.</p>
<p>When everyone was paying attention to rising prices, happily eating, drinking, and guessing fingers in the hotel, and indulging in decadent music... the enemy's iron hooves rushed over. The flames of war spread from Burma to the border town. Fortunately, a group of people evacuated quickly, escaping the embrace of death. The enemy occupied the border town for more than a year. Later, we finally managed to snatch it back. Today, Longling is our territory again. I don't know what it will be like again: it will definitely lose its past prosperity, but it will not be as absurd as it used to be.</p>

<h3>Recent World Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Greek Poet in England</p>
<p>Demetrios Capetanakis was a young Greek poet who was invited to England by the British Senate in 1939. He died of illness at the age of thirty-two. During his short life in England, he left a deep impression on his English friends such as Edith Sitwell, John Lehmann, and William Plomer. He also wrote some very interesting poems and essays in English.</p>
<p>These poems and essays, along with the eulogies of his friends, are all collected in a recently published book "Capetanakis: A Greek Poet in England". There is a photo in front. Ms. Sitwell's eulogy reads: "The concentration of meaning it conveys is amazing, with a dazzling glow, narrating a terrible darkness."</p>
<p>Apart from talking about his beloved modern Greek poetry, Capetanakis always felt that life was dark. He talked about the writers of England, France, Germany, and Russia, believing that darkness was more than light. He talked about the English female writer Charlotte Brontë, saying that she had loved the headmaster of the school where she taught.</p>
<p>His articles on English poets are not badly written. The one about the great German poet Stefan George can be said to be a special autobiography. When talking about his own writer Panayotis Canellopoulo, he said that Capetanakis once loved reading George's works for a period of time, but later fiercely attacked George's writings. He said that George used poetry as a tool to attract his friends to him.</p>
<p>The best articles in the collection are his on Proust, Dostoevsky, and Rimbaud, especially the one on Rimbaud. He still uses his usual method to simplify the writer's attitude towards life. This new simplification seems to be more valuable for Rimbaud. He said that Rimbaud carefully went from pleasant to unpleasant. Pleasantness is a form of comfort. People indulge in fantasy and deny the terrible reality in front of them. After being fascinated by the magic of pleasure for a short period of time, he stopped indulging in pleasure in 1870. He faced reality with courage.</p>
<p>Indeed, people seek pleasure, but pleasure is blind. Art seeks truth and real-life experiences, but unpleasantness is also a path that artists want to explore. This is the "terrible darkness" that Sitwell spoke of. That is where Capetanakis's genius lies.</p>
<p>The poems he wrote are all psychological descriptions. He is very good at grasping the English language. If there are any mistakes, they should be seen as novel and attractive forces, rather than discordant. One of them, "Abel", would be worthy of being placed in a modern English poetry anthology.</p>
<p>Recently, John Galsworthy's "The Forsyte Saga" volumes 1-11 have been published by Soviet British literature researchers. There are many translators, and the chief translator is M. Lorye. Both volumes are decorated by the artist E. Kogan.</p>
<p>Sean O'Casey, an Irish writer, "I Knock at the Door" has also been published by the Moscow National Literary Publishing Department. Another piece, "Pictures in the Hallway," is also attached after "I Knock at the Door". Both of these are part of a larger work, which is obviously not yet completed and is autobiographical in nature. The translator is Kasijin, who specializes in English and American literature.</p>
<p>Introduction to Russian Novels</p>
<p>We say that the history of Russian novels is almost equal to the history of Russian literature, which is probably not far from wrong. The influence of Russian novels on European countries is really too great.</p>
<p>Janko Lavrin, a professor of literature at Nottingham University College, and an author of studies on Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, has recently published "Introduction to the Russian Novel." This book was published in London in 1942; the current New York edition has added a final chapter, "World War II and After." This book is the manuscript of his lectures, so the writing is very smooth.</p>
<p>There is a brief introduction in the front, using ten pages to talk about novels before the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, it does not mention the influence of Western culture on Russian novels in the eighteenth century, as well as the characteristics of Russian novels themselves.</p>
<p>The author regards Pushkin and Gogol as the origin of Russian realistic novels. But according to Belinsky, the naturalist school of Russian novels should have originated from Dostoevsky, not Gogol.</p>
<p>This book states that after 1880, the great writers had reached the end, and it was just like opening a bibliography, listing some names of people and books, with a little introduction attached. When it comes to Soviet novels, a new situation is changed, and a lively atmosphere is shown again.</p>

<h3>Soliloquy</h3>
<p>— Guo Tian</p>
<p>Dusk</p>
<p>Lately, I've enjoyed taking long walks, watching the setting sun glisten on the river; crimson maple leaves flutter in the evening breeze...</p>
<p>White sails return with dusk, oars hitting the water, creating a string of bubbles that burst quickly. The figure of the boatman is stretched very long on the water, completely like a bamboo pole. The firelight reddens the haggard face of the boatwoman, and there is the aroma of rice in the air.</p>
<p>Dusk quietly returns; there are twinkling stars in the sky and twinkling lights on the ground. Songs begin to vibrate in the space, very rough and very moving. The songs of people living by the water have the rhythm of flowing water. The songs of boatmen who work all day are a release of fatigue!</p>
<p>Farmers return from the fields, washing their muddy feet by the river; "The days are short, you can't get any work done!" A sigh of exhaustion.</p>
<p>"Damn it, the wheat that was just planted was eaten by wild birds!"</p>
<p>"Autumn wind rises, the weather is getting cold. The leaky thatched roof hasn't been repaired yet."</p>
<p>Shoulders bearing heavy hoes, they disappear into different corners.</p>
<p>In the dusk, I walk, casually picking up a few red leaves from the ground. I seem to feel a little warmth! I think, this is the heart of suffering people.</p>
<p>Dusk gives my emotions a melancholic color. Without the light of the setting sun, the black hand of night reaches out to the world. But when night comes, there is also firelight!</p>
<p>The reeds by the river are burning with wildfire...</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>Thanks to a friend for sending me a pot of chrysanthemums. The shabby room has a bit of elegance after a little decoration.</p>
<p>Spring is the season for flowers; red, blue, purple, white... smiles of flowers everywhere, indulging in the hot kisses of bees. Embraced by the spring breeze, absorbing the warmth of the sun; however, I do not love the flowers in spring, because their lives lack the tenacious spirit of resistance. A gust of autumn frost and a few winds and rains will give their lives to the ruthless flow of water...,</p>
<p>Autumn, paulownia leaves fall, wild geese sing sadly, a string of days full of loneliness and desolation! However, the beautiful chrysanthemums bloom proudly in the autumn wind, bringing joy to people's hearts.</p>
<p>There are several wintersweet plants and a row of white chrysanthemums planted in the small garden behind the house. My preference for chrysanthemums and plum blossoms is nothing more than love for their tenacious spirit in the wind and snow. The great autumn scenery, lingering by the flowers; or admiring chrysanthemums under the snow, a cup of clear tea, has sent away a lot of time, but those are the days of the past.</p>
<p>In the midst of war and chaos, I have lived a wandering life for a long time. Now the small garden behind the house is a desolate garden overgrown with weeds. In the heart of a traveler who is a guest away from home, only a warm memory remains.</p>
<p>Facing the pot of chrysanthemums on the desk, I use a brush to depict her charm and paint on my emotions...</p>
<h3>Eight Immortals Cave</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>— Travels in Jia Prefecture</p>
<p>I live on the west bank of the Min River, and to visit the so-called Eight Immortals Cave here, I must cross the river to the east bank. Accompanied by Di, I took some spare change and walked towards the Yidu (ferry) port at the edge of the market. The so-called Yidu in the past was originally an act of charity. At a certain port of a river, some people cursed while steering small boats, sailing lightly through dangerous waves, disregarding their own lives, and at the same time taking the opportunity to solicit fares from passengers. They often sacrificed many lives. Later, some people came forward, gathered money from many people, built larger boats, and hired reliable boatmen to steer them. For those who had to cross the water, they did not charge a fare, but they could cross safely. This practice was a public service. In Jia Prefecture, which is still a morning-industry society, it provides absolute convenience for tourists crossing the river.</p>
<p>The Min River is not wide, and it is often as calm as a mirror, so the ferry is just an ordinary long plank boat. Except for a small cabin at the stern for the boatman to store his meals and bedding, there are no other structures on the boat. The boatman only needs to use the bamboo poles a few times when leaving and approaching the shore. In the middle of the river, he uses a wooden pole as an oar, inserting it into a wooden pillar, and rowing dozens of times to cross. Therefore, passengers and boatmen sitting on the boat feel as if nothing is happening. But the dock on the other side is quite high. It is conceivable that in summer, when there is a heavy rain and water rushes down from the nearby mountains, the Min River will also widen and surge with temporary waves. We struggled to walk up the riverbank and walked forward along the road at the foot of the mountain. Before long, we turned into a winding mountain path with lush trees. The Eight Immortals Cave is on the not-very-high mountaintop, but we still had to climb more than a hundred stone steps, and several hills.</p>
<p>Using bricks, we scared off the dogs of the villagers halfway up the mountain, and continued to climb the mountain. Amidst the dense forests and bamboo, buildings were revealed, including stone platforms and pavilions, a small-scale architectural complex. This was already the Eight Immortals Cave.</p>
<p>The story of the Eight Immortals is a Taoist myth. I think its meaning is nothing more than using the lifestyles of eight people to symbolize a carefree life that is not responsible for anything. These eight people are not entirely fictional. Although their backgrounds and experiences are different, they have all seen through everything and returned to their original state, living naturally according to their interests and hobbies, without competing with the world, and each living out their years. Therefore, they are called immortals. God is wisdom, and immortality is nature. Living a lifetime with wisdom and nature, that is an immortal. This is probably the true meaning of the Eight Immortals. However, the naming of this Eight Immortals Cave is probably unrelated to the original characters and meaning, but rather a place for monks to earn their living, like a dilapidated government office, with officials gone and buildings empty, leaving behind incompetent petty officials, keeping the old chess and card seals, and begging for money from tourists. But after all, a temple is better than a government office because it has some property. So here, it is painted very freshly. An old monk with a wine-stained nose came out of the old wooden house built against the mountain. Two bowls of clear tea made us sit on the stone platform facing the river in front of the main hall. The main hall is actually a vault of mountain stones with彩漆 painted Buddha statues inside. It seems that there are few people who come here to offer incense, and more who drink tea. Therefore, the Buddha statue has become a beautiful decoration, with the meaning of a large children's toy. And this so-called Eight Immortals Cave, which should have been a blessed place, a place of seclusion from the world, has also become a corner of society. However, being able to have half a day of leisure, drinking clear tea here, chatting with the old monk, and looking out at the Min River behind the green bamboo, hearing the barking of dogs in the mountains and the voices of people among the trees, and thinking of some people who died in the war, also gives me the comfort of being an immortal for a few hours.</p>
<p>I had the idea of staying here, but the monk said that some of the empty rooms were already occupied by soldiers. The wine-nosed monk, smoking a long pipe, filled with leaf tobacco, spoke entirely in the tone of an old party member. High prices, difficult life, and coping with distress were the center of the conversation. He was also struggling to make a living. Indeed, where in this world are there people who truly live in seclusion from the world? Shaving one's head only saves a little trouble on oneself. As I was leaving, I took out some tea money. He resolutely refused to accept it, but I resolutely gave it to him because, when paper money is still somewhat useful, I am sometimes still afraid of people who do not want money.</p>
<p>Crossing the river from the original ferry, sitting on the plank boat, I saw the setting sun shining on the boatman's bare body, wearing patched shorts. Talking to him, I learned that he was only earning the money I gave him, which he calculated was not enough to eat his fill. But he had the health that we envied. Jun said that the health of sailors is because they are nourished by "sunlight," "air," and "water" all year round, which makes a lot of sense. But, isn't "eating" also very necessary?</p>

<h3>Ode to the Pastoral</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>It has been more than ten years since I returned to my hometown; this time, returning to my village, I approached my old home with a joyful and hurried heart. Seeing a long row of oleanders in front of the door, already over ten feet tall, I felt strange: who would have the leisure and interest to plant oleanders in front of the door during the years of war and chaos? Upon entering the door, I asked my family who planted the row of trees in front of the door? My family, hearing my question, laughed and said, "Didn't you plant them yourself?" Then I suddenly remembered that I had indeed planted trees more than ten years ago. The saplings were taken from a relative's house. At that time, they were no more than three or five inches tall, but now they are over ten feet tall. Thinking about how I have lived more than ten years in a muddled way, and today I am still the same as before, with no progress to speak of, while those three- or five-inch saplings, during my muddled days, have grown into a row of tall and lush trees, it is truly a stark contrast. I also thought: why do trees thrive in the process of more than ten years, while human affairs often fail to progress? Considering the reasons, it is probably because the growth of trees is left to nature, while human affairs often encounter complications and many obstacles.</p>
<p>The noise of the city and the quiet of the countryside also form a stark contrast. Especially at night, the whole village can be said to have entered a state of silence, so quiet that one can only hear the sound of silence in one's ears. I don't know if it's because there are no pedestrians at night, or if the villagers can't afford to raise dogs after several years of war, but one can't hear the sound of dogs barking in the village at night. Of course, the quiet of rural life and the noise of urban life are only superficial. In the city, although we see people bustling and carriages and horses flowing, forming a noisy mass, but in the depths of people's hearts, there is inevitably a sense of indifference; even in neighborhood life, aren't neighbors each for themselves, unrelated to each other? As for rural life, under the current circumstances, how can the villagers live a truly quiet life? Therefore, in the countryside, it is quiet on the surface, but tension is still inevitable at its core. It's just that, comparatively speaking, the unnecessary hustle and bustle that is common in the city is not present in rural life. The tension of the villagers is often due to the environment, and it is passive, while the tension in the city is mostly due to self-disturbance.</p>
<p>In recent years, a method of "cooperative pig raising" has become popular among the residents of my village. This is a kind of rural economics that is not found in economic treatises, and it is worth mentioning. Around April or May, the villagers begin to raise pigs, but the main food for pigs—bran—has become an expensive thing amid the rising prices of everything, so some people want to raise pigs, but feel that the burden is too heavy and they can't afford it. Therefore, they came up with a cooperative method: for example, if your family gets bran when milling rice and feels that you don't have any other needs, you can provide the remaining bran to the pig-raising families every month to feed the pigs. You agree with them that you will supply a certain amount of food every month, then a certain portion of that pig will belong to you. When the twelfth lunar month is coming to an end and the new year is approaching, you can slaughter the pig and get a certain portion of pork. The author believes that this method is extremely reasonable. This can also be said to be one of the rural economic moods in an economically turbulent situation.</p>
<p>Rural life in this turbulent era is certainly not as peaceful as it used to be, but I always feel that it is more lovely and realistic than urban life. A large part of urban life, we can really only call it "emptiness." When residents of American cities feel disgusted with urban life, they often feel like they want to "get away from it all" and decide to move to quiet places in the countryside to live. Some commentators say that this is escaping reality. According to the author, this is just escaping emptiness, not escaping reality. Moreover, those Americans who move to remote mountains and isolated villages are not doing it for laziness, but are still living a laborious Robinson Crusoe-style life. Chinese scholars have always admired pastoral life, but apart from Tao Yuanming's "Returning Home," a short lyrical essay, there are probably very few works about pastoral life; while in recent years, the American publishing industry has indeed published a lot of such works, including several thick tomes, one of which is "The Egg and I," which was made into a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been wanting to get rid of the empty life in the city and go to a remote mountain village to live a pastoral life of self-cultivation and self-weaving, as described by Mencius in the style of Xu Xing. There is no poetry to be spoken of in such a life. According to my fantasy, it would be best to have a slope of mountain land that is not too steep and not too flat, planting some peaches, plums, melons, and fruits; at the foot of the mountain, it would be best to have a few acres of morning fields, planting some rice, wheat, and cotton; and then raising some chickens, ducks, cows, and pigs, and if the agricultural products obtained are more than enough for our own use, then we can exchange them for daily necessities such as soap and candles; and build a few thatched cottages on the flat land in the mountains, taking the old and young to live there, working at sunrise and resting at sunset. Such a life can probably be worthy of ourselves and worthy of the people. This is my ideal "Shangri-La in the world."</p>

<p>The number of fortune-tellers in Shanghai is simply astonishing. There are "True Left Hands" living in grand hotels, and "Atomic Fortune-telling Doctors" from abroad; below them are "Great Differences" and "Zhang Tie Kou" setting up stalls on the roadside; and even in the alleys of small vegetable markets, hanging a mask diagram and acting as fortune-tellers who determine the fate of others.</p>
<p>Although I have never consulted them, I understand the "philosophy" of fortune-tellers. Based on the zodiac, the hour of birth, the five wealth attributes of the face, and the lines on the hands, they can calculate your future success or failure. They tell you when you will have good luck, and how many years this good luck will last. If you do business at this time, you will definitely make money and become a boss; if you become an official, they guarantee that you will be promoted and become a big official with some kind of title. They also urge you not to move rashly in a certain year, because the year is unfavorable and you are likely to lose your official position and lose money. They have calculated that the "fate" of famous historical figures is good, so they hang it up as a demonstration; as for beggars and coolies, they are born to be miserable.</p>
<p>In fact, to put it bluntly, calculating "fate" is calculating "wealth." The goodness or badness of "fate" is the amount of "wealth." When you have good luck is when you get rich—as for promotion, they seem to think it's just for getting rich—how many years of good luck you have means how many years you can get rich and enjoy good fortune. Fortune-tellers can only indicate this! (Why don't fortune-tellers get rich themselves? No one would think of this question.)</p>
<p>The Chinese people's enthusiasm for worshiping the God of Wealth is rare in the world, and the Chinese people's judgment of people based on wealth is also rare in the world. In theory, a person's value does not lie in whether they are a boss, manager, big official, or small clerk, worker. However, the Chinese believe that having money means having everything, and the more wealth you accumulate, the higher your social status and the greater your fame, becoming an object of envy; no one will investigate the morals and knowledge of this rich man, or whether he obtained his wealth through proper means. The expression of this ideology is especially severe in Shanghai: wearing a well-tailored suit can get you convenience everywhere; if you wear a blue cloth gown, you are likely to be subjected to scorn. Coupled with the temptation of high material enjoyment, it further stimulates people to want to get rich.</p>
<p>Understanding this, you know why the Chinese love fortune-telling, why Shanghai, such a large city with a high level of culture, has such an abnormally developed fortune-telling industry, and why fortune-tellers are the darlings of heaven in the present day, just because they can calculate how much wealth you can accumulate!</p>
<h3>In Praise of Selfishness</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Yang Zhu's advocacy of "not doing it even if it benefits the world by plucking a hair" is, I don't know, merely non-aggression, or still wanting to pluck other people's hair to benefit oneself? If he cherishes his own hair and at the same time can respect other people's hair, then even if it is selfish and self-interested, the world can be peaceful. What a pity is that in order to benefit themselves, people do not hesitate to pluck all the hair of the people in the world. If plucking hair is not enough, they still want to skin them, eat their flesh, and drink their blood. How can the world not be chaotic?</p>
<p>It can be seen that selfishness and self-interest are not absolutely bad things. On the one hand, they can make the world peaceful, and on the other hand, they can lead to great chaos in the world, just as water can be used for drinking and irrigation, but it can also flood houses, and fire can be used for warming and cooking, but it can also burn down cities. But in reality, mankind has not benefited from it, and the disasters they have suffered are far worse than those suffered from floods and flames.</p>
<p>Mankind is known as the essence of all things, but it is pitiful that in this respect, they are just as insensitive as other things, and sometimes even more insensitive. Just imagine, if you harm others for your own benefit, would others be willing to be harmed by you honestly? Similarly, others will harm you for their own benefit! This is why the world's deadliest weapons have the greatest achievements in all sciences. In this way, on a small scale, everyone is constantly scheming and secretly calculating each other, and is constantly in danger of being secretly calculated; on a large scale, countries are constantly preparing for war and fighting each other, and there is a daily threat of war. The result is: the purpose of harming others has been achieved, and the evil cause of harming oneself has been created. This is all due to a foolish, cruel, cowardly, and selfish view of self-interest.</p>
<p>Wise selfishness and self-interest are aimed at the happiness and interests of all mankind. Once mankind is blessed and benefited, you are also a member of mankind, and you will naturally be among those who are blessed and benefited. Therefore, the so-called seeking the welfare of mankind is actually nothing more than a means of pursuing selfishness and self-interest, but this is wise, and therefore stable.</p>
<p>Benevolent selfishness and self-interest not only do not infringe on the welfare of others to benefit oneself, but also have a benevolent heart of "feeling pain when others drown and feeling hungry when others are hungry," and even sacrifice oneself to save others, and feel at peace in one's heart. This kind of self-sacrificing behavior is to relieve one's own guilt and satisfy one's own joy of helping others. It is also a kind of selfishness and self-interest, but this is benevolent, and therefore noble.</p>
<p>Courageous selfishness and self-interest is to seize benefits from nature, such as overcoming disease and death, opening up mountains, rivers, and lakes, driving away poisonous snakes and beasts, resisting hurricanes and rainstorms, developing material science... This is to treat all things as straw dogs, and of course it is selfish and self-interested; but this kind of struggle to seize benefits from nature is more difficult and greater than the struggle between people, and there is absolutely great courage. And the benefits that we exploit and seize are inexhaustible and inexhaustible in nature.</p>
<p>When will mankind abandon foolish, cruel, and cowardly selfishness and self-interest, and transform into wise, benevolent, and courageous selfishness and self-interest? For the sake of selfishness and self-interest, I hope that such a time will come soon.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter One: Striving to Remedy (24)</p>
<p>Yunqing said, "Of course I have intentions in this. I am planning for you. Now, this is the only way to go. Your going back is most beneficial to you." Zhuzhai said, "I can't go back. I can't live in that family!" Yunqing said, "Then what are you planning to do?" Zhuzhai said, "I want to leave Beiping and fly far away!" Yunqing said, "So you still want to go to Shanghai to find Qihuan, right?" Zhuzhai lowered his head upon hearing these words, and shook his head slightly, saying, "No! Seeing her may not have any results. I plan to wander for the rest of my life." Yunqing said, "You just said you wanted to be a monk, and now you're talking about wandering outside. These are not serious words. You'll regret these emotional words later. Now you have to change your mood. Don't look at Fengsheng so annoyingly. Just think of her as a strong and capable woman. You work hard outside and entrust the family to her. You won't have any worries. At your age now, you should also move forward in your career. Don't always be spinning in the circle of love. Now I plan to write a letter to Fengsheng to explain for you. Will you go back and try again?" Zhuzhai said, "If you had done this last night, it would have been possible, but now if you call me to go, I feel sad in my heart." Yunqing said, "Then let's do this. You go back first, and after I've settled things with Fengsheng, I'll tell you." Zhuzhai said, "My intention today is not for this. What I mean is that I hope our previous goals can be achieved. If we can, we'll proceed. If we can't, I'll leave Beiping. I hope you can give me a clear answer." Yunqing said, "I don't agree with you leaving Beiping. You can't achieve your previous goals either!" Zhuzhai said, "Then what do you want me to do?" Yunqing said, "I can't give you an answer right now either. Anyway, I have a good idea. Listen for a letter in a day or two." Zhuzhai saw that he had bothered Yunqing for a long time with no results, and stood up disappointedly, saying, "Take good care of your health! Don't worry about my affairs. I'll probably leave Beiping in a few days." Yunqing saw his expression and didn't say anything, watching him go downstairs. Zhuzhai returned to his dormitory, thinking that he had been rejected on both sides. Now he had to find a way to jump out of this city of Beiping to avoid mental distress. To leave Beiping, there are only two ways: one is to find a job in a bank and be sent out, wherever they send him is fine, to change the environment; the other is to find his old classmate Li Xiaosong, who has a good position in Nanjing, and it shouldn't be a problem to have him find a small job. However, how to explain it to his parents if he were to leave Beiping forever is a difficult problem.</p>
<h3>On Associative Power</h3>
<p>— Xu Jinjin</p>
<p>According to zoologists' research, mice do not have extraordinary intelligence, but only associative power, but their cleverness or cunning seems quite impressive. Professor Watson of Johns Hopkins University in the United States once conducted an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>On a flat surface, he arranged a maze with many crisscrossing and complex piles. Many crooked paths were impassable. He placed a piece of cheese in the center, and then took out a mouse that had been hungry for several hours and placed it at the entrance of the maze.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Professor Watson left the room and looked in from a window where the mouse could not see or smell him. He took out a pocket watch, a pencil, and a piece of paper to record the mouse's scurrying around. After smelling the cheese, the mouse was extremely excited and scurried from the main road to the small paths, got lost in the winding forks, and then returned to the main road, and in a moment broke into another winding small path. In short, it took a total of sixteen minutes to obtain the cheese.</p>
<p>So Professor Watson took the mouse out, and the next day placed it in the same place. Now the mouse only took fourteen minutes to obtain the cheese, and it had recognized several "no through road" roads and was no longer fooled. To put it simply, in the thirtieth test, the mouse only took six seconds to scurry to the location of the cheese.</p>
<p>The above experiment can provide an annotation for the Chinese idiom "practice makes perfect." From the mouse's point of view, it is also a corroboration of "failure is the mother of success." However, the focus of this article is not here, but on explaining the breadth and interest of associative power.</p>
<p>For example, the dripping of water in a pot and the falling of an apple seem unrelated to the steam engine and the law of gravity, but Watt and Newton, with their rich associative power, created new theories and deserve to be pioneers of modern civilization.</p>
<p>Secondly, seeing an object and thinking of a person often makes people feel endless emotions, and "seeing an object and thinking of an object" is also a common occurrence. When I eat out, I see the leftover bones and scraps of food, or the fish bones piled on the table, and I think of the fat-headed and fat-brained little white cat that I keep at home. The scene of it wagging its tail and begging for food is as if it were right in front of me. Naturally, I would not wrap the fish bones in paper and bring them back, but it seems a pity to throw them away.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I really like to read the current affairs cartoons in books, newspapers, and magazines. Recently, in a certain publication, I saw a black and white painting depicting a soldier symbolizing a certain country, drinking a bottle of inflation wine, and his body was huge, floating in the air like a balloon. I myself, like everyone else, have no experience of floating in the air, and it is quite difficult to experience this feeling. With my associative power, the most I can think of is the feeling of floating in the bathtub when bathing, which may be similar.</p>
<p>Also, when I send out manuscripts, in order to avoid the pages being reversed or scattered, in addition to pasting them with paste, I mostly use small paper clips to clip them together. When using paper clips, I often think of the person opening the letter, and if they are not careful, the tip of the clip may puncture their finger. Therefore, I always clip the tip of the clip to the back of the manuscript to ensure safety. Although I have no way of knowing whether the editors have noticed these small details, I think it can avoid the small misfortune of pricking their fingers.</p>
<p>Finally, I think of the many talented and intelligent people in the world, such as genius mathematicians, who can find the answers to complex problems in just one or two minutes, and genius musicians who can master various instruments and write beautiful and pleasing melodies. ... One of the reasons may be that their associative power is particularly developed. If we still take mathematicians as an example, their brains are like complex calculators, which can add, subtract, multiply, and divide at the same time, unlike ordinary people who first add and then subtract, or first multiply and then divide. Other than this, it seems quite difficult to find other appropriate explanations for the genius's extraordinary understanding.</p>
<h3>European Ancient Costumes</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>From the excavations in the peat bogs of Northern Europe, we can trace back to the strange ancient costumes of Europeans in the Iron Age, 1500 years ago.</p>
<p>The clothes excavated from these bogs often still contain the bones of the wearer, or are wrapped around shrunken, terrifying corpses. Both the corpses and the clothes tell us a lot about the lives of Europeans long ago.</p>
<p>The men of that era wore short trousers, fastened with a belt; the shirts on their upper bodies resembled the vests of Western women today, some with sleeves and some without. When it was cold, they added a coat that wrapped around them, decorated with tassels, and fastened with a hook. They wore spiral leggings on their lower bodies. The shoes were made of leather, soft on the inside, with the fur exposed on the outside, not scraped off.</p>
<p>Few women's clothes have been excavated from the bogs, and most of those excavated are woolen clothes, with excellent weaving techniques, the whole garment being like a single piece. The colors are mostly black and blue. It is speculated that women at that time mainly wore hemp, but hemp is difficult to preserve in the bogs, so it has all decayed without a trace.</p>
<p>More than fifty corpses of men, women, and children have been excavated from the bogs of Denmark, northern Germany, and Ireland, most of which are male corpses. It is generally believed that most of the people who were sunk into the bogs were death row inmates sentenced according to the laws of the Iron Age. A few may have been victims of assassins and murderers, who buried them in the bogs to cover their tracks.</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Huang Binhong</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Currently, there are elderly painters in Shanghai over the age of eighty, namely Yao Yuqin and Quan, and in Beiping, there are Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong. I knew Mr. Huang Binhong twenty years ago, during the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. My old friend Wang Jihuan ran the Wang Family Printing House near Zhangjia Garden on Avenue Edward VII, publishing the "Ding Zhoukan" art weekly. I published the "Mo Yuan Ban Yuekan" in Jinan, and also submitted paintings to be published in "Ding Zhoukan."</p>
<p>Binhong happened to live at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat, in a dormitory of the Zhengyin Bookstore. He saw my paintings and thought I was his old friend Yu Jianhua from Taicang, so he sent me a long letter, expressing his feelings of separation. I replied, explaining the situation and expressing my gratitude. That summer, I came to Shanghai and stayed in the Wang Family Printing House. I was only a stone's throw away from Mr. Binhong, so we often visited each other and became friends despite the age difference. On the Double Ninth Festival of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Binhong guided me to Taicang to meet Yu Jianhua with the same name and surname. We enjoyed poetry and wine together, and the gathering was very lively.</p>
<p>Around the eighteenth and nineteenth years of the Republic of China, my old friend Zhang Shanzi and his younger brother Daqian lived in Xicheng Lane on Ximen Road. Mr. Binhong, through my introduction, rented an upstairs room. Xiong Songquan and my old friend Ma Qizhou both lived in Yongyu Lane, not far away. Later, I also moved to Xihu Fang, next to Yongyu Lane, facing Xicheng Lane. I then invited my old friends Chen Gangshu and Cai Yimin, along with eight people, to form the Rotten Cartoon Society. Mr. Binhong was the oldest, and Daqian was the youngest. Later, Mr. Binhong took over the Shenzhou Guoguang Society for a period of time, and moved to Fenyang Lane on Avenue Foch. The Shenzhou Guoguang Society was originally founded by Deng Qiumei, specializing in collotype printing of ancient books, paintings, rubbings, and compiling and printing the Shenzhou Guoguang Ji, Shenzhou Daguan, and art series. Mr. Binhong was involved in many of these matters. When Mr. Binhong took over, he originally intended to continue the art publishing business, but it soon changed in nature. The person in charge instead devoted himself to the social sciences of historical materialism, and Mr. Binhong quietly withdrew.</p>
<p>Mr. Binhong went north to Beiping in the twenty-sixth year, intending to take a position at the Palace Museum, but shortly after, the July 7th Incident occurred. He quickly settled in the ancient capital and could not return south. He closed his doors to write books and paint, not asking about outside affairs, and his life was extremely difficult. Mr. Binhong was frugal in his daily life, had no hobbies, could drink but never got drunk. In the twenty years I knew him, I never saw him suffer from any serious illness. In addition to studying calligraphy and painting, he also liked to collect bronze seals, using their characters to verify the bronze inscriptions and Shuowen Jiezi. He accumulated a collection more than a foot high, but unfortunately, it was never published. Most of his paintings are landscapes, based on traveling ten thousand miles and reading ten thousand volumes. Although he often wrote about scenery, he ultimately expressed his own feelings. However, in recent years, his works have used too much ink, seeming to lack clarity and sparseness. Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that Mr. Binhong had lost sight in one eye. I am in the north, thinking of my old friend, and I hope the news is not accurate.</p>
<h3>Fan Shi-hu's Diary</h3>
<p>— Chen Gao</p>
<p>Fan Shi-hu, whose given name was Zhineng and styled himself Shi-hu Jushi. He was a Jinshi in the twenty-fourth year of the Shaoxing era. Three kinds of his diaries have been published. They are Jiaosui Lu, Cuanlu, and Wuchuan Lu. According to the History of the Song Dynasty: "When he was an envoy to the Jin dynasty, he initially presented a letter, his words and tone were impassioned, determined to deliver the letter and return to his residence, and he ultimately preserved his integrity and returned." Jiaosui Lu records what he saw and heard during his mission to the Jin dynasty in the sixth year of the Qiandao era. In that year, Cheng Da was appointed as Grand Academician of Zizheng Hall, and Kang Kui, the Commissioner of Chongxin Jiedu, was appointed as his deputy as envoy to the Great Jin Kingdom. The diary also begins in the fifth month (leap) and ends in the eighth month. It meticulously records the routes, customs of the Jin envoys, exchange rates, and palace facilities, expressing his ambition to pacify the world. For example, on the days of Gengwu and Guimao, he described the lamentations of the remaining people for their nation and the envoys' emotional tears, which were truly vivid. It is capable of inspiring national righteousness, and its purpose is abundant. Guimao's record states: "Passing by Youhe, there is Youli City above, with four bottles standing like dignified residents. The woods are too full within. Woxiang Prefecture has Qin Lou, Cui Lou, Kangle Lou, and Yuebai Fengqing Lou, all of which are qiting. Qin Lou has a foreign woman, wearing a gold tower with large sleeves, with a gold tower and purple silk belt, she speaks the Northern language. It is said that she is a daughter of the royal family, from the prefectural governor's family. The remaining people often wipe their tears and sigh. The messenger said: 'These are people from the Chinese Buddhist country,' and many old women knelt and worshiped."</p>
<p>Next is Cuanlu, which records his journey from Wuxing to Guangxi as a commander between the years of Ren-chen and Gui-si. Reading it is like being in a winding, remote valley with a rushing, clear stream. Also, Wuchuan Lu describes his journey from Chengdu to Pingjiang when he was recalled as the Sichuan Zhizhi Envoy during the Chunxi Ding-you era. His eyes explored everything within dozens of miles, and his writing is often light and witty. For example, the record of the wonder of the eighty-four bends of Mount Emei and the strange illusions of the silver world. Li Ciming's Yue Mantang Diary says: "Reading Fan Shi-hu's Cuanlu... my mind wanders to Lipu and Guilin... Cuanlu's writing is already clumsy, far inferior to his Wuchuan Lu. However, apart from Lu You's Records of Entering Shu and Zhang Yunsou's Bin Xing Lu, there are few equals. The record mentions that the small hills and slopes on the banks of the Xiang River are endless and are all earthen hills. There is no intention of lofty peaks and beautiful ranges, but only desolation connected to each other. And after passing Hengshan, he also said that there is another layer of small hills; mountain people live in seclusion, and peach and plum blossoms are just blooming, looking like being on the road to Lin Gao. It is the same as Du Tong's poem: 'Flowers and trees are deep on both sides of the Xiang River,' only here is there meaning in the line." Thus, the depth of the Xiang River can also be generally seen.</p>
<h3>Human World</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Reading Shu Fan's poem crying for He Yangling, I was deeply moved by the extraordinary grief and pain. In the autumn of the previous year, Shu Fan mentioned that he saw all of my works at Deng Sanmu's place and was eager to meet me. We were both too busy and could not fulfill this wish. Unexpectedly, he has now passed away. Humans are not immune to feelings of attachment. I composed two poems, hoping to express the same sorrow.</p>
<p>One cry breaks the string, three cries dim the eyes, such tears have long been absent in this world. Who would have thought that in this desolate and deserted land, the spirit of Qingfeng and darkness is not forgotten. A true friend is worthy of risking life and death, and how many grudges have there been between those who discuss their hearts since ancient times? Your poem should be read on Huangshan, with tigers and leopards ahead.</p>
<p>The pain of Qiuling's books is forever cut off, how could one know the fate of the other with just a glimpse? I wish I had the ability to control Li, but I lower my head to look at the sword and feel sad for Xu! If we trace back our family history, we should be from the same clan, and in vain, we share the same neighborhood in heaven and earth. I never followed your words, but in the west wind, I shook hands and met you.</p>
<h3>Recollections of Yu Lou</h3>
<p>— Banmeng Laoren (Old Man Half-Dream)</p>
<p>The other day, Ling Jihan's article on Luoyang, the capital of the Central Plains in Henan, mentioned that Yu Quyuan was impeached and dismissed from his position as Education Commissioner of Henan and returned to his hometown. This made me think of Mr. Yu Quyuan, who was supervising education in Henan. He set the topics "Wang should quickly issue an order to rebel" and "The lord's wife Yang Huo desires," and was impeached and dismissed. However, in his poetry collection, he only said, "I inspected the Central Plains and was dismissed due to people's words," without mentioning this matter. He said: "Clouds and smoke pass by without a trace, it is good to return to the countryside and close the door, everything is right and wrong, let the officials discuss, and one official position is the emperor's favor." He also said: "Don't blame the rumors for being too groundless," which shows that the matter of setting the topic was probably just hearsay, and nothing more than someone trying to slander him. His wife also had the line "After taking off the court hat, the whole body feels light," which shows that her thoughts were pure and there was nothing to criticize. He also said: "It is difficult to be harmonious with the world if the edges and corners are not smoothed, and one can face the sky with a pure heart." The storms of officialdom can rise at any time, but harming him was actually beneficial to him. From then on, he indulged in the scenery of the lakes and mountains, and lived peacefully in the paradise-like places of Suzhou and Hangzhou, and wrote the book Qunjing Pingyi, becoming a major Confucian scholar of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>He first taught at the Ziyang Academy in Suzhou, and later moved to teach at the Gujing Jingshe in Hangzhou, following Wang Lanquan and Sun Xingyan. Zeng Wenzhenggong once said that Yu Yinpu was a true scholar (Yinpu was Quyuan's given name), and also said that Li Shaoquan desperately sought officialdom, while Yu Yin desperately wrote books (Shaoquan was Li Hongzhang's given name), which shows that everyone at the time admired him, and his reputation was not in vain. His poem "Traveling to the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gorges" says: "Layers upon layers of mountains, winding and circling roads, dong dong ding ding springs, high and low trees." The wording is ingenious and appropriate.</p>
<p>He wanted to imitate Li Fanxie's "Floating Plum Village" in West Lake, using huge bamboo as rafts, floating in the lake, building a thatched hut on the raft, with vermilion railings around it, setting up green curtains to open and close, laying wooden planks like a platform below, in which six or seven chairs, tables, wine cups, tripods, basins, tea stoves, chess sets, and other items could be placed, traveling back and forth in the lake, but in the end, he did not succeed. He only made a small raft in the Quyuan Garden in Suzhou, roughly in the same style, named "Small Floating Raft."</p>
<p>Later, the disciples of the Gujing Jingshe built a building for him at the foot of Gushan Mountain, west of the Liuyiquan Spring, with the Gushan Temple to the east, piling up ponds and rocks, named Yu Lou. His Yu Lou had four wonders: (1) Buddha wonder: He dreamed of an ancient Buddha not decorated with gold, entering through a jade green door, with a crane guarding the books below. (2) Immortal wonder: In the middle of the night, the lotus flowers in the lake bloomed greatly. He thought of getting a small boat to pick them, and suddenly two children came rowing a boat. He boarded the boat, went deep into the flowers, and returned with joy. When he returned, the children and the boat disappeared. (3) Divine wonder: He saw a light green frog on a pine tree, its whole body like a carved piece of jade, without any imperfections. He determined it to be the spirit of General Jinhua. (4) Ghost wonder: When Yu Lou was being built, he dreamed of a blue person coming from outside the west wall, bowing to people. The next time he saw a grave west of the building, a stone worker dreamed of a blue man, claiming to be the Ming Dynasty deputy general Wang Qingxiang, and instructed them not to offend him, so they changed the road to climb the mountain to avoid his tomb. The story spread like this, so I will just record it.</p>
<p>The small scenes of Yu Lou include Xiaoqu Garden, Qixia West House, Piaochi Pond, Banpo Pavilion, Lingsong Pavilion, Xiaopenglai Islet, Xishuang Pavilion, He Shou Xuan, Wenshi Pavilion, Quyuan Library, and Wenquan Spring. The two characters of his Yu Lou were written by Peng Gangzhigong Yulin. He said: "Tao Lu and Xie Xi are remembered for thousands of years, how can my name be worthy of mention? Walking to the end of Baisha Causeway, it turns out everyone knows Yu Lou."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his poetic intention became a topic of conversation. Last year, I traveled to West Lake with Yu Jingzhai. Jingzhai intended to borrow Yu Lou as a place to rest, because his surname was Yu, the same as the ancient one, and the building belonged to Yu, so there would be no objection. Who knew that when we visited the west side of Gushan, we could not find Yu Lou. Mr. Quyuan's so-called "Why bother to leave" could it be "not leaving at all!" Jingzhai once sent me a poem, saying: "Jade peaks and gold peaks connect to the distant sky, opening my robe, every step I take is pleasant. Looking again at the new autumn moon after three relocations, the soft light gently shakes the front of the Tuisheng Convent. (Tuisheng Convent, Peng Xueqin...)...Remember the spring gulls entering the distant river, the wild geese have come in pairs, floating life often makes the lake... (?), I have never been on Penglai and regret fills my chest. (referring to Xiaopenglai)" It is because Yu Lou has been rented to the Xinghua Restaurant, the elegant place has become a place for wine and meat, Mr. Quyuan would be worried and sad if he knew. Afterwards, I lived in the Ziyun Cave in the summer, and Jingzhai sent two more quatrains, saying: "I want to buy a few acres of land in West Lake, to build a hut to rest my body, in the morning mist and evening haze, my eyes look into the distance, after all, the green mountains belong to the old man. Jingxi is still marked with the Bixia Gate (Yu Lou has a Bixia Gate on the left), I am happy to see that the classics and decorations still exist. A red plum tree is still blooming (there is a red plum tree in front of Yu Lou, blooming in October, Peng Xueqin made a red plum painting for Quyuan.) The army is coming, let's get drunk in Xinghua Village (referring to Xinghua Restaurant)." There are many beautiful places in the lake, and Yu Lou can be rebuilt to decorate the lake and mountains. It is a pity that Mr. Quyuan was a generation of Confucian teachers, with numerous writings, and we are unable to preserve the famous sites he managed, leaving later generations with a feeling of emptiness!</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Explanation: Wife is Immoral and Elopes with Someone Else; Husband is Affected and Intends to Divorce</p>
<p>A gentleman asks: I have been married for more than ten years, and the relationship between my wife and I is still fairly harmonious. However, due to economic difficulties, the relationship between us has become increasingly cold, and we often quarrel. In the past one or two years, my wife's behavior has become abnormal. Before, when I was out working, she once had an affair with someone (with love letters as evidence). Half a year later, she eloped with someone. Now I intend to publish a notice in the newspaper, setting a deadline for her to complete the divorce procedures and notify her family. I have a few questions, please answer them for me. (1) Can her previous love letters be presented as evidence of her affair? (2) Even if I publish a notice in the newspaper, setting a deadline for her to come forward to complete the divorce procedures, if she avoids meeting me, how should I deal with it? (3) Her parents have both passed away, does her brother have the right to represent the parents? (Her behavior is improper, and even after her brother persuaded her sincerely, she did not change. After this incident, I notified her brother, and received a reply stating that since things have come to this point, he will leave everything up to me.) If she does not come in person, and her brother agrees, can he represent her in terminating the marriage? (4) If items (3) cannot be implemented, what kind of procedures should be adopted to terminate the marriage?</p>
<p>[Legal Consultant Mr. Tang Ming Shi answers: (1)] Husband and wife should forgive each other. If one party commits a fault, and the other party forgives it, the previous matter is written off. Therefore, Article 245, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law stipulates that if a spouse forgives, they cannot prosecute. (2) Unilateral publication in the newspaper, even with a deadline, cannot be used as a basis for divorce. The so-called consensual divorce requires the consent of both husband and wife. See Articles 1049 and 1050 of the Civil Code. (3) The identity of husband and wife, their union and separation, even parents cannot represent them, let alone brothers. Therefore, if she does not express her opinion, her brother cannot represent her. (4) If an agreement cannot be reached, and the other party has a situation as described in Article 1052, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, you may request a divorce from the court.</p>
