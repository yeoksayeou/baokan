<h3>杜魯門總統咨文國會　正式提出援華計劃　數額為五億七千萬美元</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕杜魯門總統本日向國會提出特別咨文，建議以五億七千萬美元援助中國之計劃，全文如次：</p>
<p>本人曾屢次申述，建立全世界公正持久之和平環境，爲美國主要目的之一。此乃美國人民專心致志之主張。</p>
<p>日本投降以後，吾人曾畫極大之努力，並以大量金錢援助並復興各遭受戰禍國家，使其恢復爲維持和平所需之各種可以發揮效能之經濟制度。指導吾人援助各遭受戰禍國家之原則，厥爲助其人民自謀援助。</p>
<p>國會爲促進此項目的，刻正愼重考慮最重要與最有遠大影響之一項建議，此即援歐計劃提案是也。</p>
<p>本人現請求國會，考慮我國所應繼續供給中國之援助。</p>
<p>美國人民與中國人民間已有多年眞誠友誼。兩國間復有悠久之商業與文化聯繫以及密切無間之合作，美國人民對中國人民素極敬仰，對於彼等所遭遇之種種試煉與困難，深表同情。</p>
<p>美國久已汝認：中國之安定，對太平洋及全世界持久和平極關重要。中國因地大人衆，已成爲國際關係上一項重要因素，中國有優良傳統與文化，並有爲數衆多與精力充沛之民衆，吾人切盼中國强大進步，俾對國際力量之增强，作充分貢獻。</p>
<p>因此，自中國國民政府於二十年前成立以來，吾人即不斷予以支持，中美兩國在對日戰爭中同爲盟邦，吾人且以盟邦立場支持中國對日之英勇抗戰。自日本投降後，吾人復給予多量之援　，所有給予中國政府之軍事援助，不僅爲協助其擊敗日本侵略，且爲協助其收復日本佔領地區。中國自聯合國善後救濟總署所獲得之大量援助中，美國所供給渚居其大部份。吾人又曾以最低價格將對中國經濟有價値之大量剩餘物資及設備讓予中國，吾人現正依照對外救濟計劃，繼續救助中國。</p>
<h3>共產軍破壞交通　更加深中國損失</h3>
<p>但中國政府與人民現仍受內戰及經濟急劇衰落之雙重壓迫，八年抗戰中，由於日本佔領與封鎖而造成之艱難情形，適發生於正須從事建設之時，復因內爭而益趨嚴重。共產軍對主要交通之繼續阻攔與破壞，更加深抗戰時期運輸及生產設備業已蒙受之損失。</p>
<p>政府因內戰而增加之開支，遠過其收入，致復興工作更受妨碍。爲應付開支不斷發行之通貨已形成惡性通貨膨脹，以致破壞正常之商業活動，在此稱情勢下，中國之外匯準備，迅速减少至不足以償付重要進口貨物之地步，苟無此類進口貨物，工業活動將形萎縮，經濟衰落將更加甚。</p>
<p>中國經濟之繼續衰落，美國實極關懷，自馬歇爾將軍離華返國以來，曾不斷考慮援華問題，吾人希望中國之環境能使美國援助得以有效及具有建設性之方法，用於建設及復興方面。吾人所期望之環境迄未形成，故祗能在現在之情勢下，就其最適當者辦理之。</p>
<p>吾人可能協助减經現下之經濟衰落，以使中國政府獲得另一機會，開始建立較爲穩定經濟環境之必要步驟。但情形早即證明，惟有中國政府本身方能採取必要步驟，造成適當之環境，使爲和平及眞正經濟復興之努力，得以生效。</p>
<p>爲決定可能適合此項目的之計劃的性質與範圍，吾人應注意各種不同而相互牴觸之因素，包括目下我國資源之其他負担，若干物品之能否獲致，中國政府所遭遇之各項問題之範圍及複雜性以及此種問題得西外援而解決之程度。美國對華援助，有如對任何其他國家之援助，必須適合其特殊之需求及容量。</p>
<h3>援華計劃應規定　借款或贈與方式　數額估計可依物價而修正</h3>
<p>根據此等因素，本人建議國會核准五億七千萬美元，作為一九四九年六月三十日以前之援羅計　。</p>
<p>此項計劃應規定以借款或贈與方式，將五億一千萬美元作爲償付輸送重要進口貨物至中國之資金，此係根據一九四八年一月一日物價之估計，因現下無法逆料物價變遷將如何影響此種計劃也。苟有必要，修正之數額估計可於請求撥款時提出，所謂重要進口貨物，包括糧食·棉花·石油·肥料·烟葉·藥品。煤斤及現有重要設備之修理另件。此項計劃中所規定之數量，係與可能獲致之供應品相配合，由美國償付此　重要進口貨物，可使中國政府利用其有限之美元，以應付其他需要中之最迫切者。</p>
<p>該計劃並應爲將在一九四九年六月三十日以前着乎進行之數項選定，建設計劃，備具款項六千萬美元，恢復必要之交通工具，燃料及電力事業，以及出口工業，其需要實屬孔亟。此項工作可在無軍事行動之區域着手辦理，並可帮助改善必需貨物之供給及分配。</p>
<h3>執行援助計劃　中美應簽計劃</h3>
<p>一如援助歐洲之復興，此項援助計劃之執行，應由中國與美　簽訂協定一項，規定辦理此項援助之條件及手續。該協定中應包括若干保證，即中國政府將採取切於實際之經濟財政及其他措置，以期達到經濟穩定及復興之目標。苟美國斷定所提供之援助未依協定辦理，或斷定中國政府之政策與利用援助以帮助完成經濟自給自足之目的不符，則美自當保留其停止援助之權。</p>
<p>在爲辦理歐洲復興計劃而設立之機構成立以前，對華之援助，應由目前辦理對外救濟計劃之現行機權推行之，核准援華計劃之立法，應將援華計劃之辦理，移交與辦理我國援助歐洲復興之機構，辦理機構需要隨時調整計劃之權力，猶如辦理歐洲復興計劃時需有隨時調整之權力然。</p>
<h3>在經濟衰落中　予華喘息時間</h3>
<p>建議中之對華援助計劃，本人認爲係本國政府參照所有情形而能採取之最佳途徑。本國藉援助而給予之一切，無論如何絕不能用以代替僅中國政府所能採取之必要行動，然此項計劃仍能完成一項重要目的，此即予中國政府在經濟衰落中以喘息之時間，俾能設法建立較爲穩定之經濟情形。苟無此項喘息之時間，中國政府能否建立此種穩定情形，殊屬疑問。此項有限之目的，其實現具有如此重大之意義，足以證明建議中之援助計劃爲合理。</p>
<p>故本人建議，此項計劃應由國會迅速予以有利之考慮。</p>
<h3>美正討論援華　我國不宜評論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕我政府官員於十八日夜讀悉美總統向國會所作關於中國之致詞後，即由新聞局長董顯光宣稱：「當美國援華議案尙在國會中討論之際，中國政府認爲不宜加以評論。」</p>
<h3>我償還美借款</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕中國大使館今日宣布，中國已向美國進出口銀行償還一九四一年借款一三，六九八，〇〇〇元。中國並已履行戰時合約，以價値三，六五〇，〇〇〇元之金屬，繳付建設金融公司，售款所得亦將繳付進出口銀行。此款償付完畢，一九四一年借款總數五千萬元即已全部淸償。此舉證明中國政一府，不顧本身外匯缺少，仍竭力一維特信用。</p>
<h3>美報諛用〔反動〕　董局長予以糾正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕董顯光局長十八日在記者招待會發表談話稱：近來美國報紙於評論中國時，常以「反動」一詞指稱中國政府，本人對於「反動」一詞之意義，固不欲深專推究，惟感此詞已延濫用，亟應指出其謬誤，以正視廳。（下接二版一攔）</p>
<h3>馮欽哉自張赴平</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕新任平行繼　主任馮欽哉，十八日午自張項乘車來平，馮氏抵平後，將與　　　同時就任行　副主任。</p>
<h3>外部時司長發表談話　韓國應自由選舉　違反協定所建政府我不予考慮</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕外交部情報司長時昭瀛，十八日在政院新聞局記者招待會答復詢問稱：北韓確切局勢現尚有待澄清。中國政府對違反聯合國大會之決議及莫斯科協定所規定之程序，在韓國所建立之任何政府，當然不予考慮，中國政府亦無法了解兩佔領國之任何一方。能忽視莫斯科協定及聯合國大會之權威，而在韓國自建政府，聯合國鑒於兩佔領國家不能協同實現莫斯科協定之規定，即曾在大會之決議中接受輔助韓國人民實現其民族獨立之責任。此項責任之接受，實有嚴肅莊嚴之意義，因其不僅爲兩千萬朝鮮人民之幸福所繫，抑且爲遠　普這安全之所關。因此，中國政府將堅決主張，聯合國韓國委員會即於可能舉行選舉之任何地區，進行自由選舉，以期產生一真正代表韓國人民之政府。（請參閱第三版）</p>
<h3>鞍山國軍堅衛市區　瀋西陸空夾擊情勢好轉　張作相萬福麟馬占山定廿二日飛京</h3>

<p>〔本報長春十八日電〕吉長地區擴面工作積極推進中，長春周邊集結之萬餘農民抗匪武裝團體，已點福完竣，駐軍頃通知各外國縣長，率保安團隊移駐縣境，待　收復地方縣鎮。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕東北旅京人士劉哲，十八日就渠等關懷之東北問題，與記者有所晤談。據稱：渠等前此曾電蔣主席，建議四項：（甲）即派大軍出關增援，（乙）起用東北宿將，以組訓民衆，（丙）利用當地兵工廠，以便製造彈藥應用，（丁）對守城攻地之人士，訂定懲獎辦法，如守城人士可作該縣之縣長等。現悉張作相即日來京，京中對此亦頗重視，張等抵京後，將與東北旅京人士集議東北問題，並晋謁蔣主席請示。</p>

<h3>新運十四週年紀念　蔣會長電勉全國　舉三義勉同胞全力以赴</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕新生活運動十四週年紀念前夕，蔣會長特代電全國，原文如次</p>
<p>新生活運動促進總會各省市分會暨全國同胞均鑒：新生活運動自們導至今，已歷十有四年，其目的在於砥　我每一國民自覺自治之本能，各盡其愛國救國之天職，而其實行之方法，為推已及人，由近及違，以食·衣·住·行之整齊淸潔，簡單樸素，迅速確實為起點，使日常生活，遵循禮義廉恥之綱維，人人皆爲自立自强，有爲有守之公民，我中國始克以統一獨立，民主法治之國家，躋於現代國際社會之林。抗戰八年，我全國同胞，冒險犯難，含苦茹辛，終能擊敗强權，獲致勝利，實有賴於我長族精神之堅忍，更足　我國民道德之優厚，而新生活運動，亦於此著其成效。今者杭戰勝利，兩年有餘，訓政已吿結束，憲法開始竄施，更望我全體同胞，發揮民主自治之精神，一致遵從法定之軌轍，必使憲政深植其基礎於國民日常生活之中，而後民主政治，得臻於健全之械，新生活運動之篤實殘履與普遍推行，彌見重要，特以三義吿我全國之同胞。</p>
<p>堅定自信</p>
<p>今日國家民族之憂患，惟在於共　之叛亂，而戡平共匪之念務，莫過於消弭共匪之政治陰謀。共匪最險毒之陰謀，即在以窮兇極惡之鬥爭，製造各階層同胞循環無已之仇恨，期使理智汩沒，道德淪亡，文化之根底斵喪，民族之精神消失，以逐其分裂領土，破壞主權，贊國求榮之大欲。我全國同胞，必須澈悟，今日之剿匪戡亂，實爲我國家在亡民　榮辱之關鍵。亦即爲民主憲政對暴民專政成敗利鈍最後之決戰，務各發揚其純潔之理智，堅定其民族之自信，人人爲救國而奮鬥，爲剿匪而動員；惟至誠乃能克服詐僞，惟正義必可制勝强暴。歷來無恥漢奸，流寇盜匪，雖狡詐百出，作惡萬端，最後未有不爲我民族道義國家企氣所摧毀，邪正之所在，即勝敗所由判，羣策羣力，務底於成，此其一。</p>
<p>提高警覺</p>
<p>戰亂與行憲，爲建國工作一事之兩面，戡亂所以排除憲政之障碍，而行憲所以樹立民主之規模，我全體軍民，在前方必須同仇敵愾，拯救受難之同胞，在後方必須自動負責，維護社會之秩序。今日共匪在其所控制之鄕村，毀法亂紀，以殘忍之鬥爭，淸除其異己份子，使民衆非被迫參戰，即無復生存之餘地；而在我後方之都市，則埋伏間諜，組織其所謂城工部，企圖擾亂各地之治安，故學校工廠中，任何集體行動，均易於變質，而成爲陰謀暴動之準綫，凡我愛國同胞，均應提高警覺，相互　勉，守紀律，負責任，始能限制共匪之活動，保障公衆之安全，此其二。</p>
<p>勤勉儉約</p>
<p>國父有言：「精神勝於物質，革命必先革心。」今日經濟問題，人爲之操縱，多於自然之因素，心理之恐慌，過於客觀之事實。所望我同胞，明禮義，知廉恥，察利害，審公私，以勤勉求生產之增進，以儉約節物資之浪費，勿投機以助長游資之作祟，勿囤積以激起物價之飛騰，導事業於正常之軌轍，制利潤於合理之限度，使国家經濟社會政策，得以澈底實施，則經濟危機，必能克服，而戡亂建國亦於此奠其基礎，此其三。</p>
<p>總之，國家令日已邁進於憲政時期，存亡榮辱，取決於國民自覺之程度與自治之能力，我全國之同胞，必須以堅張之信心，持整肅之生活，認淸義利，明辨是非，培養人民愛物之情緒，負起救國建國之責任深信國家之統一，憲政之成功，武裝叛亂之剿除，經濟危機之克服，皆在於此願我同胞父詔兄勉，矢勤矢勇以赴之。中華民國卅七年二月十八日，蔣中正。</p>

<h3>重受新生活的洗禮！　—新生活運動十四週紀念</h3>
<p>今天是新生活運動第十四週年紀念日。在十四年前的今天，當蔣主席駐節南昌的時候，為了要振奮國民精神起見，特提倡新生活運動。新運最初的目的，除了要使一般國民具備國民的道德和國民的知識而外，還要使他們都能除舊佈新，過着一種合乎「體，義，廉，恥」的新生活。自從倡導新生活運動以後，方及三年，全國就發動了對日的抗戰。在短短的三四年間，要全國人民不論在意識上，行動上，或生活上都能澈底革新，當然不是一件容易的事情，而且在積重難返的情况下，也幾乎可以說是一件不可能的事情。所以在抗戰期間，中央政府遷移到重慶之後，後方各都市每月舉行國民月會，名義上雖說是國民精神總動員，實際上就是要把新生活遝動的要義，經常喚醒一般官民去身體力行，使公私生活都能獲得一種澈底的革新。誰都不能否認，新生活運動對於抗戰勝利有莫大的貢獻，不過這種貢獻，是一種精神的道德的力量，不像物質力量可用數字估計的。</p>
<p>近來時人論及現代國際戰爭，都說是「科學的戰爭」，戰爭的勝負要完全取決於物質的力量。而我們，雖不是絕對的唯心論者，認爲人類仗其勇氣即可以血肉與炸彈砲火相拚，但是總覺得不論科學如何進步，物質力量如何強大，終究是要靠精神力量去運用的。即以我國抗戰而論，從九一八事變發生到全面抗戰爆發的一個時期，日本軍閥的物質力量，可謂登峯造極，遠非我國可比。我國若徒恃物資力量和日本角逐，不啻有天壤之別，但是我們竟在物質的劣勢之下，毅然不顧，對日發動全面抗戰，不僅苦撑了八年，而且還獲得了最後勝利。這種成敗不計，生死以之的抗戰，靠了什麼力量支持呢？很明顯的，這是我民族的精神力量！蔣主席去年今日曾說：「回溯抗戰八年，歷盡艱難，終賴全民振奮，克致勝利，足見我民族精神，實有其不可磨滅之光芒。」這種精神力量的根源，就是新生活運動所提倡的「禮，義，廉，恥。」</p>
<p>然而，看看目前的情形，不論是人民的生活，或是社會的風氣，使一設想新生活運動所揭　的目標，眞令我們無限感慨。我們實在敢說一句探本窮源的話：今天中國禍亂的所以發生，以及未來國家民族的隱憂所在，就是因爲一般人不能恪守新生活信條，也就是多數人早已把禮，義，廉，恥束之高閣。大而言之，勝利以來，共匪展開了全面的叛亂，一面聽命異族，割裂中國，另一面鼓煽邪說，毀滅文化。孟子所謂：「邪說暴行有作」，不啻爲此時的共匪寫照。共匪的目的，不僅要使我國喪失了千載一時的建國機會，要使一般人民都感到生命生活的威脅，而且盡量蠱惑一般無知靑年，破壞我民族的固有道德，意欲把我國的倫理觀念根本推翻。新生活運動雖然經過了十四年的倡導與實踐，禮·義·廉·恥在共匪看來是落伍，是腐敗，是頑固，是守舊，好像必　踢凈盡，使之掃地無遺而後快。他們强逼子弒其父，為殺其兄，還講什麼體？他們犧牲人民，背叛祖國，還講什麼義？他們以鬥爭淸算爲名，據掠刧其實，還講什麼廉？他們美其名曰性交自由，配給婦女，還講什麼恥？有共匪存在一天，禮·義·廉·恥即「受辱」一天。管子說：「四維不脹，國乃滅亡」。共匪就是要用道個方法來使中國亡於共匪所崇拜的　族主子之手！</p>
<p>更返觀我們最近的社會風氣，萎　腐爛，也實在要用雷　萬鈞之力，使整個社會重受新生活的法滌。國家這樣危難，土兵那樣艱苦，而上海市民——尤其是高等市民的生活，如何奢侈荒唐？春節放假這幾天裏，他們呼盧喝雉，興高彩烈，一擲千萬，視爲尋常，甚至一塲大賭，輸贏動以數十億計。其他驕奢淫逸的情形，更不必說。天哪！他們爲什麼不想想在天寒地凍的戰塲上健兒們在流他們的血？他們爲什麼不再想想在街頭上在庇寒所裘啼飢號寒的難民也是同胞？他們爲什麼不更想想還有無數淸寒有志的靑年正在愁着繳不出高昂的學雜費而行將失學？這些享受豪奢生活的行屍走肉的人們，何嘗再有絲毫禮·義·廉·恥的觀念。他們忘記了肚會，忘能了國家，只知有個人，只知自私自利。共匪之猖狂，固然由於他們暴力主義所驅使，但這些腐敗的社會風氣也是促成的因素。而一般官塲，只講敷衍，不負責任，相互袒護，不重紀律，這種腐敗無能的政風，若不澈底加以革新，那末中國的政治前途，也就暗淡得很。傳作義將軍說：剿匪必須政治·經濟·文化等與軍事相配合，方可完成。眞不錯，我們以爲最需要配合的，莫過於整肅風氣，澄淸吏治，而要做到這兩點，就非用大力量來推行新生活運動，實踐禮·義·廉·恥的生活不可。</p>
<h3>董顯光答記者問　（上接一版）</h3>
<p>問：政府目前武器及軍火之供應，來自何方？</p>
<p>答：一部份曾購自國外，一部份係中國自行製造。</p>
<p>問：貝祖飴氏何時返國？</p>
<p>答：本人未有所聞。</p>
<p>問：幣制改革，邇來朝野人士多予討諭，我政府有關當局對此全國關切之問題，態度如何？又貝祖詒氏在美曾對此事有何洽商</p>
<p>答：行政院張院長於二月五日出席立法院會議，報吿總預算案時，曾嘗及幣制改革問題，謂幣制改革，旣爲與論所鍾，政府之主張亦復如此，但因（一）國家動員戡亂，支用浩繁，（二）共匪破壞交通，摧毀經濟，致生產萎縮，運輸滯阻，若干地方供需不相應，物價不易穩定，（三）受匪患影響，人民顚沛流離，負担力量减少，因此穩定幣値，穩定物價，在改革幣制以前或以後，固同等重要，但準備改革幣制，必須先行建立一種使幣値漸趨穩定之基礎，本人此外並無意見可以奉吿。</p>
<h3>美報誤用〔反動〕</h3>
<p>（上接一版）一般對「反動」一詞，類多任意應用，而未能瞭解其眞義，按「反動」一詞，乃自英文（Rcactionary）譯來，吾人試查閱韋氏大辭典，則知此詞原意係謂「贊成舊秩序之回復，其詮譯「反動份子」則爲「意圖阻得政治上之進步者」。　吾人試問美國作家於我政府爲「反動」時，能在我政府中舉出任何合乎上項定義之人否，此問題本身即足顯示彼等濫用名詞之荒謬背理。</p>
<p>我政府重要人士，類皆高瞻遠矚，抱具自由思想，渠等堪爲中國最進步份子之代表，日以繼夜，努力促進國家之進步，而未嘗「阻礙」其進步，渠等在自由觀點與時代思想方面，倘與西方民主國家開明之政治領袖逐個比較，實堪並駕齊軀，而無愧色。當然若輩全屬實事求是之人士，極端份子或共產黨徒，自無混跡其間之可能，渠等刻正竭力根除各種弊害與落後現象，並於政治及經濟情勢許可範圍內，領導中國人民勇往邁進，建立進步與現代化之政府，必要時，且不顧困難，强行改革，本人可向懷疑份子確切保證，吾人現正邁往於切實持久之進步途中。</p>
<p>中國政府歡迎任何眞正自由分子之參加，惟盼其能於民主新憲法規定範圍內一體工作，寗足視此爲苛刻要求耶，揆諸事實，甚多知名之自由人士，已在政府之內力圖憲法之有效實現，是故所謂我國政府反動云云，究其根源，實係赤色宣傳而已，深感吾人個能宣布一項道德標準，限制此詞之演用，必能促進國際同之眞正瞭解。</p>
<p>「反動」一詞，今日幾已成爲　農政敵所常用之稱號，美政界亦有同樣誤用，據本人所知，過去數十年內，每次總統競選運動中，敵對政黨或總統候選人間，不免以「反動」或「反動份子」互相譏嘲，然雙方以此相互指責，固不能使任何一方眞正成爲反動份子，蓋政治上應用此詞，已喪失其眞正意義矣。</p>
<p>美國若干主筆撰寫社論時，於無意中誤用此詞，中國受害殊大，易使不知眞相者誤解中國，以爲中國民主與反動兩大勢力壁壘森嚴各趨極端，而實際情形決非如此，中國一如其他國家，亦有思想較爲落後之人，然彼等並未參加政府，而若干主筆通常所謂民主人士，中國人民咸知其爲受極權共產主義利用之傀儡而已。　我國對海外友人之眞摯批評，極表歡迎，渠等指出吾人之眞正缺點，提供客觀標準，協助吾人衡量國策之臧否，對我貢獻實大，惟若一味從事誣蔑，中美雙方實皆無裨益也。</p>
<h3>我出席聯大代表　周謙沖自美返國　談美預防經濟恐慌錯施</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕出席聯合國大會我代表團顧問周謙冲氏由美返國。據談，聯合國之前途雖殊顯淡，但認爲不必悲觀。關於美國經濟恐慌能否避免一事，渠稱，任何國家均不能閉門解決一切問題。美國政府預見其經濟不安定之趨勢，故已採取抓種預防措施，如恢復物價統制，緊縮信用放款等。馬歇爾援外計劃，余信其主要目的亦在避免國內之不景氣，蓋惟有各國均臻繁榮，美國始能保持其繁榮。經濟恐慌決非人力所不能挽救，但如馬歇爾計劃所予各國之援助太少或太遲，對美國之經濟恐將產生不良好之結果。渠謂，美國在各方面大量援華之計劃，即可有所決定。余在華盛頓時，馬歇爾將軍曾吿余謂：「國會通過援華法案，當無重大困難，但民主制度下，凡事不能求之過速」。據余觀察，美國對華援助亟望能收獲百分之百的效力，故吾人自身必需努力實行改革。周氏定今晚晋京向政府報吿出席聯大經過。</p>
<h3>臺灣鋁業公司　中美合作草約內容　資本雙方各佔一半</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕美雷諾鋁業公司與我資委會合辦台　鋁業公司之合作草約簽訂後，現正俟雙方上級機構之核准，即可簽訂正式合同，開始實行。記者頃探悉該項草約之內容，其要點如次：甲，原則方而，雙方採取平等合作方式，鋁業公司之資本，我資委會與美雷諾公司各佔百分之五十，談判進行時，我曾主張雙方資金之比例爲五十一比四十九，結果仍按照平等合作之原則，各爲百分之五十。乙，組織名稱仍爲台灣鋁業公司，以董事會爲最高權力機構，董事共七人，其中中美各佔三人，另一人於必要時由雙方協議聘任之。丙，經濟合作，該公司之股本總額共一七〇〇萬美元，共分兩種，一，普通股本一百萬美元，中美各半，二，優先股本一六〇〇萬美元，中美各半，此項股本，雷諾公司投資之八五〇萬美元，用以購置器村，我資委會之八五〇萬美元，則以設備及機器等作價。同時，雙方爲切實實行經濟合作計，草約中並規定，於必要時雙方可協同向美進出口銀行借款。丁，技術合作，雷諾公司可派技術人員來華，參加該公司之工作。戊，雙方合作開始後，該公司下設一軋鋁工廠，從事軋鋁，將來發展鋁業，將以民生日用品爲主。</p>

<h3>學生公費待遇問題　教育部賀司長談話　一律全公費不可能</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕關於學生公費問題，敎部賀司長師俊頃發表談話稱：學生公費待遇，爲政府甚大負担，現尙有要求一律全公費者，非僅政府財力上不能許可，於理亦有未合。</p>
<p>公費學生沿革</p>
<p>按今日公費與講學金，起源於戰時之貸金，最初爲數甚微，款均由各校自行勻支，廿九年秋，始改由政府撥發，三十二年改稱公費，然始終均規定至抗戰結束或學生畢業時爲止，去年五月，參政會四屆三次大會，以公費辦法原係戰時制度，倘仍不改，實足養成學生之依賴心理，是經決議，已享受公費之學生，自可繼續維持至畢業爲止，此後新招學生，應視其學業成績及家庭環境，改用獎學金辦法，俾優秀有爲之青年，可以深造，一方面政府可將現行之鉅額公費，移充學校敎學設備之用。參政會此種決議，政府業經照辦，自上學期起，規定以考取新生百分之二十給予獎學金，其原經核定公費有案者，仍繼續發給公費，而新生中之師範生，保靑生，靑年軍復學生，邊疆生，革命及抗戰功勛子女與就學之榮譽軍人，均一律給予公費，不受名額限制。去秋以後復以綏靖區擴大，匪區學生甚多，又規定國立及省立專科以上學校學生之籍隸匪區，經核准救濟者，免其學宿費，幷比照八費生膳食標準，供其膳食。政府對於學生之愛護，可調無微不至。</p>
<p>政府負担鉅重</p>
<p>現全國專科以上學校，計有全公費生七萬六千九百七十八人，半公費生一萬二千一百八十一人，中等學校全公費生四萬四千四百七十一人，半公費生一萬二千七百六十五人，總計全公費十二萬一千四百餘名，半公費二萬四千九百餘各，省級公費不在內。公費生遇待，主合費每生每月食米二市斗三升，或麵粉四十六市斤，除配給區域照配給價折發代金外，餘均照市價發給副合費，按公敎人員生活基數三十七分之一，乘生活指數發給。依此標準，東北各校每生每月公費已達三百餘萬元，京滬區以有配給關係，每生每月四十餘萬元。本年上半年度預算，學生膳費一項爲四千三百餘億，佔部管敎育經費百分之十五，但事實上不敷甚鉅，連同追加尙未奉准者，計本年上半年約需七千三百餘億，約佔部管敎育經費百分之二十五。現外間盛傳有人策動一律全公費待遇，則勢須使學校敎學設備經費愈益偏枯，硃非辦理敎育之正道，且我國初等敎育因經費困難之故，失學兒童基多，政府竟費大量金錢供給中等以上學校學生之膳費，純出自維持敎育苦衷，若再增加名額，一律公費，不僅悖於情理，世界各國亦無此先例。</p>

<h3>華北華中戰事較沉寂　戰局重點在東北　國防部發表一週戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國防部新聞局頃發表自二月十一日至十七日間一週戰局如次：</p>
<p>東北　各戰場的戰事，最近是關外激烈，而華北華中則比較沉寂，戰局市點在東北，因此各方也關心東北的情况。在上週，遼北的國軍曾向石佛寺以北展開掃蕩，竄踞該地區的林匪第一三·十·兩縱隊與第一縱隊的一部，和　獨四師，共約五萬人，匪　集　企圖蠢動，曾受打擊，由於匪的狡猾，不肯和國軍決戰，匪第三·十·兩縱隊又折向石佛寺西南竄擾，企圖阻斷瀋陽新民間的　遼西方面，匪看到錦州的國軍大兵團開到，切斷北寗路的計劃，已在動搖，只留第九縱隊及第八蹤隊各一部，牽制國軍兵力，其第一·二·四·六·七·各縱隊共約十萬人，都東調遼中瀋南附近，於乘隙進奪遼陽之後，週來又以四·六·八·等縱隊約六萬人圍攻鞍山，孤立營口，企使瀋陽南段直通海口的交通綫阻絕。遼陽一役，國軍消耗了匪軍主力萬人之後，才轉移陣地，目前鞍山的防守戰，正特展開。</p>
<p>華北　華北聶榮臻匪部，自在保定外圍和平漢綫北段徠水附近遭國軍痛剿後，數星期來雖極力避戰，喘息整補，迄今仍未恢復元氣，國軍在此已逐步完成進剿佈署，並講求政治勦匪方策，週來除冀察北部掃蕩工作甚爲順利外，其他各處戰事，比較沉寂。</p>
<p>華東　華東陳毅在豫東生存無地，主力被迫回竄魯西，其第一·四·六·八·兩廣等縱隊，及其第三縱隊的幹部人員，共約六萬人，原圖喘息整補，但在國軍勁旅日夜追剿之下，迄未獲得片刻休息的機會現在他大部兵力已竄到荷澤以東，及定陶，城武，鉏野間的狹小地區，至其原留於曹縣城武間之第十·十一·兩縱隊，近正爲數烙猛進之國軍夾擊於曹縣以東，單縣以南地區，進退不得。</p>
<p>華中　劉伯承匪部近來的處境，由於陳毅主力回竄魯西，已陷入相當恐慌的程度，大別山區廣大幅員百分之八十爲國軍控制，重要據點悉爲國軍所有，刻劉匪以第二·三·六。縱勵共約五萬餘人，活黝於大別山少數山區，求兵無源，求食不飽，求戰無力，且彈藥奇缺。劉匪在上月曾親率第二縱隊冒死北竄，企岡打開一條　給綫，並接受陳毅輾轉送來的一些東西，國軍於淮河北岸，曾予迎頭痛擊，迫其匆促逃回，並於回竄沿途，連續遭受打擊，本月十四日新店（經扶　）一役，又將該匪第六旅擊敵，其第三縱隊當劉匪北逃之際，原圖攻犯岳西，牽制國軍兵力，策應劉匪，結果不但未能發揮絲毫牽制之效，反於本月六日岳西解圍之戰，及十三日水吼嶺（岳西南）之役，遭受損失，目前仍化整爲零，潛伏於岳西東南西三面山地中。總之，舉國矚目的大別山戰局，事實上現已進入軍民聯合的淸剿階段。其他晋陝地區，豫西地區，及大洪山區之各匪，　　有小接觸，但並無顯著之　　。</p>

<h3>美參院外委會正式表決　援歐案修正通過　規定受援國應平衡預算</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕參院外交委員會於今日正式表決，一致通過該會所起草之歐洲復興方案立法案，並名之爲「一九四八年經濟合作法案」，規定自四月一日起之十二個月內，對歐洲十六國發動五十三億元之援助計劃。參院將於三月一日開始辯論該案。參院外委會主席范登堡宣稱，援歐方案內已由外委會加入最後一款修正案，規定各受援國應按實際情形儘速平衡共政府之預算。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十七日電〕美參院外委會今日正式通過一項法案，批准連續四年之歐洲復興計劃，及第一年初期撥款五十三億美元。惟委會規定初期撥款中之三十億美元，廳自本會計年度財政盈餘項下支撥。共和黨參議員急欲使政府有足够財政盈餘，俾爲下一會計年度削减所得稅起見，乃通過上述規定，使三十億美元之信用貸款，自本年度政府稅收項下支付，否則如在下一會計年度項下支付，此款即予指責。主持上述修正案之參院財委會主席米利金稱，政府建議之九十億美元援外計劃，對下一年度財政之負担實爲過重，該會今所取之行動，使國會通過歐洲復興計劃及共和黨建議削减稅收四十五億至六十五億美元之機會，更獲進步。同時共和黨削减數字之舉，乃一種政治行動，以示明年度預算之减省，及爲選民减輕賦稅負担。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕衆院外委會主席伊登今日表示，削减援歐費用如爲使援歐法案通過國會階段之唯一辦法，渠亦將同意削減。伊氏聲明「余仍贊成長期援助計劃，但爲通過該案起見，而有削减數額及期限之必要時，余亦將表示贊成。伊氏並透露，衆院外委會可於下週末完成公開審查，然後即開始起草其立法案。在三月一日參議院開始辯論以前，不致完成起草。一般預料衆院外委會所將通過之數，將較參院外委會核准之五十三億元爲更少。」</p>
<h3>小型大會下週四開會　朝鮮問題列議程　美國務院暫時保持緘默</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十七日電〕聯合國小型大會於下星期四舉行會議時，朝鮮問題將列爲議事日程之一，聯合國朝鮮委員會有特別報吿書一件，預計可於星期四送達，小型大會將檢討蘇聯與烏克蘭拒絕參加朝鮮委員會，以及蘇聯拒絕在朝鮮與之合作等問題。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕國務部對於外傳北韓成立人民共和國之說，在該處局勢廓淸以前拒絕發表意見。同時南競美軍總司令霍奇將軍之政治顧問傑勃柯已自韓國來此，將與馬歇爾國務卿檢討韓境新局勢。權威方面透露，關於北韓最近之發展，報紙所傳消息與國務部所獲情報略有不同，故在調查淸楚以前，美官方不致有何行動。</p>
<h3>紐約時報社論　批評北韓情況</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕紐約時報十八日社論批評韓局稱：「朝鮮僅爲全景之一部份。美國及聯合國刻正面臨一長遠之蘇聯政策，此政策之賭注高於思想及朝鮮內閣，此賭注乃東北是也。東北刻在西北兩面受蘇聯側面之威脅，如蘇聯控制朝鮮，則東北之南部亦將受其威脅。此舉可由受蘇聯指揮之中共組織，，東北在短期內可變成「獨立的社會主義蘇維埃滿洲共和國」。朝鮮不過爲進展中之一站。聯合國小型大會已遭遇若干冷酷之政治事實。東北對蘇聯極有價値，一旦控制朝鮮，則東北可埀手而取。東北對中國亦極重要，如中國力圖自戰墟中復興，聯合國一切作爲均應作如是觀」。</p>
<h3>美軍官受嘲弄　霍奇提出抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城十八日電〕據此間官方宣佈，蘇聯佔區北韓軍隊檢閱時，曾有美軍官兩人遭朝鮮人嘲弄，美駐朝鮮軍總司令霍奇少將已提出强硬抗議。霍奇之抗議乃向蘇二十五軍司令考洛特柯夫少將提出者，在抗議未達平壤前，其內容暫不發表。</p>
<h3>美援希特別軍費　將逾一億元</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十七日合衆電〕美國會若通過目前援希計劃，則其戰後在希臘所下之賭注，即將逾十億美元。美援希款項包括杜魯門主義下所貸之三億美元，其總數則爲七億六千七百萬美元。據估計希臘可在馬歇爾計劃下於開始之十五個月中，獲得一億八千六百萬美元。美政府不久將要求國會撥出援希特別軍費一億餘美元。</p>
<h3>伊朗向美購軍火</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十七日電〕伊朗國會今日經激辯後，業已批准向美國訂購價値一千萬元之武器及軍事配備，價款在十二年內分期付淸。</p>
<h3>法大使訪羅維特　商西德問題</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕法國大使龐納今日會與副國務卿羅維特，商談下週一將在倫敦提出討論有關西部德國之問題。龐納吿記者稱，渠會强調指出法國正在爲魯爾區覓致國際化之重大步驟，並特別着重於「鋼鐵工業方面」，且法國贊成「德國之眞正有聯邦化組織」。</p>
<p>至於比荷盧三國是否應參加倫敦會議一節，龐納稱，法國贊成其參加。渠表示其信心稱，將來可以覓致一項方法，使三國能表示其意見。</p>
<h3>社經會波蘭代表　論援歐計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十七日電〕波蘭代表　琪在聯合國經社理事會中稱，馬歇爾方案將在西歐遭遇失敗，原因有二：（一）西默尤其是德國之工業產品及剩餘輸出物，如不將東歡列爲消費者，將無出路。（二）西歐國家在工榮上互相競爭而不能互相轉佐。蘭氏力言復歐洲之一部份而對另十部份予以歧視，事實上殆不可能。在經濟上分裂歐洲，乃政治考慮的結果。期集中對西歐之經濟援助，以建立歐洲政治上的新均勢，此項政策有悖經濟羅輯，代價旣昂，且必致失敗。</p>
<h3>東歐三外長會議結束　將發表聯合宣言　據稱此會目的在增進集體安全</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格十七日電〕捷克波蘭南斯拉夫三國外長會議，將於明晨強束。明日下午貝納斯總統擬接見波南二國外長，預定於當晚發表共同聲明，波南二國代表團定於明日午夜啓程返國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社普拉格十七日電〕捷克波蘭南斯拉夫三國外長今日在此間舉行商討德國問題會議。據一般人對今日三外長演說之印業，該會似不欲叛離西方列强而作最後決定，但發出莊重之警吿，呼籲列强對此歐洲嚴重問題加强合作而已。南外長西米契抨擊西方列强之對德政策，措辭甚爲尖刻，波外長莫捷列夫斯基則採取較溫和態度，說明普拉格會議之目的，欲增進集體安全和平爲不可分割之一體，此一原則爲聯合國之基礎云云。捷外長馬薩里克稱，吾人不宜放棄希望列强對於德國問題最後必可獲致協議。普拉格外交界人士懷疑此點能否實現，蓋捷克政治家之希望，未必能與列强之實際行爲符合一致也。同一方面又稱東方與西方列强意見分歧進行「冷戰」，德國可坐收漁翁之利，不僅危害歐洲之和平與安全，且將波及全世界</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格十七日電〕捷克外部發言人稱，十七日在普拉格揭幕之捷南波三國外長會議，決非針對任何西方强國。在會中不擬討論任何土地問題，目的僅在促起對德國束鄰的需要及關切之注意。捷南波三國深恐片面決議將减少經濟改良的機會，因而增加德人暴動的可能性，斯拉夫國認爲惟有由據國毗鄰贛小國從事合作，始　確保中歐之和平。　波南三國　於總三發表宣言，對解除德國武裝及裁减戰爭工集之不力，表示不滿，並將要求在對德和約中，規定禁止向鄰邦發動宣傳攻勢。</p>
<h3>紐約勃隆克斯區　選舉出冷門</h3>
<p>於華萊士競選總統有利</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約十八日電〕紐約附近勃隆克斯區今日舉行國會議員複選，候選人共四名，結果由支持前副總統萊士競選下屆纖統者紐約州勞工黨之候選人伊薩克生當選。勃隆克斯區原爲民主黨所佔有的區域，伊蕯克生於當選後表示，「此乃華萊士及其第二黨之勝利」。</p>
<h3>解散日本財閥政策　麥帥願充分支持　美參議院宣讀麥帥函件</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕參議院中今日會宣讀麥帥一函之表示除非完全摧毀日本經濟權力之集中，日本或將發生革命性的流血暴動。麥帥表示充分支持國務部解散日本財閥及經濟權力的集中之政策。並日：日本人民決不願重受極權政治及極權經濟的束縛。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十七日電〕財長克利浦斯今日在下院宣布，麥帥總部已批准分配日工業資產百分之三十，作爲賠償，其由六分之一已撥與英國，以使立即發給緬甸及英國遠東屬地　第一批機械短期內即可運到。</p>
<h3>日首相提名將延至下週</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十八日電〕日本決定首相提名之衆議院會議，依目前形勢觀察，有必須延至下週舉行之勢，現各黨均未至可以決定提名首相之階段，</p>
<h3>對日管制會拒絕討論日內政　蘇聯代表提議不成立</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十八日電〕聯合國管制日本委員會今日舉行第五十二次會議，蘇代表提議討論一「日本片山內閣辭職理由及下屆內閣政策」問題，美代表答稱：「根據麥帥之指示，此項問題係屬日本國內政治問題，應由日本人自身解決，本會議無討論必要。」然蘇代表仍聲明保留此項提案再提出討論之權利，第五十二次會議。又不歡而散。</p>
<h3>西德邦委會成立　十六名委員名單已發表</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗朗克福十七日電〕西德英美合併區「政府」邦委員會之委員十六人，業已明令任命，名單如下：北萊茵威斯特法利邦：阿諾德總理（基督民主黨），經濟部長諾爾廷（社會民主）。下薩克宋尼邦：柯浦夫總理（社會民主），財長史特列支魯特（基督民主）。舒爾斯霍格。霍爾斯坦邦：呂特曼總理（社會民主），經濟交通糧食農林部長狄克曼（社會民主）。漢堡市：勃勞爾市長（社會民主），前漢堡駐行政委員會代表漢森（肚會民主）。巴伐里亞邦：埃哈特總理（基督社會聯盟），巴威利亞參院議長（基督社會聯盟）。赫斯邦：史篤克總理（社會民主），財長希爾伯（基督民主）。阜登堡色登：梅爾總理（基督人民黨），經濟部長維特（社會民主）。不萊梅市：凱塞市長（社會民主），參議員哈姆生（社會民主）。</p>
<h3>火星確有生物　兩極且有冰區</h3>
<p>〔合衆社德克義斯州麥克唐納天文台十八日電〕鑲克　斯天文學家宣稱：據最近火星之研究巳得初步證明，火星上確有原始性之生命存在。十八日淸晨火星離地球僅六千三百萬哩，爲兩年中兩星相距最短之距離。天文學家利用戰時中發展之　自八十二英吋望遠鏡之紅內光譜發現火星中可能有　苔類植物之生長，並發現火星之兩極亦有水所結成之冰區。</p>
<h3>菲峻拒日本　參加碧瑤會議</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十八日合衆電〕據可靠方面訊：菲政府已斷然拒絕日本建議派遣二代表至碧瑤，出席廿三日召開之糙農組織會議。菲政府且反對日本在菲律賓附近捕魚之建議。據愁，糧農組織會議將開始作營養及漁業之技術討論，大會至三月一日將進行糧食問題之討論，以便實施去夏糧農組織在日內瓦所討論之諸項建議。諸項建議包括（一）增加生產，（二）市塲與分配，（三）各地糧食供應之儲存，（四）穩定價格。</p>
<h3>保大將離法返港</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十八日電〕安南遜王保大將於兩日內離法國里雜埃拉之加納，前往日內瓦轉返香港。保大與越　被拉爾之會談已決定改期，兩人原定上星期五在越南海面之法國巡洋艦上會晤，保大上週曾在巴黎與　曼總理等會晤。</p>
<h3>智利總統抵南極　發表廣播強調領土不容侵略　英國仍堅持由海牙法庭解決</h3>
<p>〔路透社智利京鹹十七日電〕智利總統維特拉業於十七日下午抵達南極南歇特爾羣島格林威治島外之主權灣。智利已在格林威治島建立永久陸軍基地，維特拉即將發表廣播演說，以答英外次麥克尼爾在下院中之聲明。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社聖地牙哥十八日電〕智利總統維持拉今日在蘇伯蘭尼亞參加某一典禮時，發表列强在南極重作領土之爭奪稱，「歐洲帝國主義之捲土重來，係極爲威脅智利之舉，企圖從智利及美洲奪去屬於智利之南極領土，智利以鎭靜處之，應付此項對和平及人民安全有危險之威脅已歷多次，但美洲今日並非在解除武裝及不相團結情况之下，故不能容忍美洲以外任何强權之使略。智利總統最後結諭稱，彼企圖推翻聯合國憲章及國際公法之人，應憶及此種侵略係爲敵對美洲一切國家而發云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社偷敦十七日電〕英外部發言人今日稱，英國將再向阿根廷與智利提出照會，堅持南冰洋領土爭執應提交海牙國際法庭判決。發言人拒絕說明英國是否接受阿根廷主張提付國際會議解決之議，僅稱此乃法律問題，宜由國際法庭解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社阿根廷京城十七日電〕英國與阿智南極土地之爭，今日此間各報社評均取保留態度，謂艦隊雖開至爭執區域，但阿智兩國希望和平解決，不擬惹起事端。</p>
<h3>三國爭福克蘭島　鈾鑛從中作崇</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕「新聞紀事報」及「每日郵報」暗示讀者，福克蘭島地下有蘊藏鈾鑛或黃金之可能性。</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處訊〕與阿根廷智利爭奪福克蘭羣島，已成爲舉世矚目的事件。</p>
<p>按福克蘭羣鳥原係南美一小島，位於西經五十一度至五十三度，南韓五十七度·四〇至六十一度·二五。各島有高山百餘，總面積六千五百方哩。最早於一五九二年由英人戴維斯所發現，二年後霍浦金在該羣島北岸完成了首次航行。一七六四年法國探險家包幹維爾佔領該島，並在該島的路易港建立殖民地，三年以後法國將該島割予西班牙。但在法國佔領該羣島的次年，英海軍派巴隆上校根據英國係第一個發現該島的事實予以佔領。英·西兩國雖同佔該島，而大家互不侵犯，這樣一直到一七六九年，兩國駐軍遂漸發生爭執。在一七七一年，西班牙與英國簽訂條約，將該島正式割交英國佔領，是爲英國在該島主權首次在國際上獲得承認，亦即英外次發表護權聲明的歷史根據。</p>

<h3>紐約時報發行　傳真版報紙　新聞業又一創舉</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十七日電〕紐約時報在現代新聞傳送上又有創舉，刻每日自其電台，向紐約十四家百貨公司播送一份四頁之傳眞報新聞。其時間爲每日上午十一時至下午四時各公司營業期內，誠爲戰後大規模利用無綫電傳眞播送新聞之第一成功試驗。此無綫電傳眞版報紙，大小約合普通報紙四分之一，並有一頁爲婦女版。傳眞報之新聞，係以新型打字機之字體播送一幅，此種新聞需時三分半點。時報刻尙不能預言此種無綫電傳眞版，何時可獲普遍訂閱，蓋收錄傳眞新聞之機件價値甚昂，且產量尙少，同時無綫電傳眞一視需要，尙受地平綫之限制，故如欲使全國俱有此種無綫電傳眞報紙，則先需設立一組電台。然時報發行傳眞版報紙一事，至少對報界未來之新發展已有預示。</p>
<h3>暹南部安謐　分裂運動已消滅　新議會決定新總理</h3>
<p>〔路透社曼谷十七日電〕暹內政部督導布卡第巡視南部諸省歸來後談稱：南部諸省甚爲安謐，分裂運動並無民衆支持，自政府採取步驟滿足回敎居民之要求後，動亂已無形消滅，派往該處之特別警察，毋庸處理分裂運動案件，現正從事制止走私活動。</p>

<h3>美衆院通過駐外軍事使團案</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處舉盛頓十七日電〕美衆院再度通過議案一件，提交參院採取行動。該議案將延長總統之戰時權限，委任駐在除美洲各國及非律賓以外各國之軍事使團。此一立法案，自去年以來迄成懸案，現已獲得國務院·陸海軍部之支持。如此案不獲通過，則可能引起美國現有駐華及駐伊期軍事使團之撤退。至於現在土希之使團，則在特別立法中有所規定。</p>
<h3>五九日蝕　馬尼剌可見</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼剌十七日合衆電〕今年五月九日，當月球進入半陰影時，此間少見日蝕。其觀蝕時間係自午前九時十八分時起至十時四十一分止。約九時十八分時，月影將遮蓋太陽表面百分之六十。</p>
<h3>美嚴格管制出口　華商請發輸出證須大使館推薦　汽油出口執照亦暫停簽發</h3>
<p>〔本報華盛頓航訊〕美國現已實行一種新輸出許可政策，對各種重要物品之出口，限制更加嚴格，並對各國政府購銷機關逕向美國出口商訂貨或各國政府駐美購料機講之自行購運均加以約束，而對於以私營進口商爲受貨人之轍出證，則將優先發給，藉以鼓勵私人貿易之擴展。因此今後我政府購銷機構，或世界貿易公司自美採購物品，須在美國對我輸出限額之內；而其限額往往較我國實際所必需輸入者爲少。</p>
<p>在美商部國際貿易署核發一切對我轍出物品之輸出證時。如我政府欲對此加以「推鷹」。須由我駐美大使館商務參事處較洽辦理。美方同意此項推薦，始可照發輸出證，否則申請書即被退回。又最近美國商人擬向我國購買爆竹數十萬元及魚鈎數萬元，聞駐美商務參事處已函請經濟部上海市工商輔導處就近與出口商接洽。另有加拿大商人擬直接向我國出口商洽購五金器具，我駐美商務參事處已函覆，予以介紹。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十七日電〕美商務部本日停發各國之汽油及其他煤油產品之出口執照，惟加拿大除外，此項執照之停發，可望僅爲時數日，在此數日中，商務部希望，自各國美使領館方面獲悉各國消費美國汽油之减少量。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕參院銀行委員會今日一致通過延長政府對錫，脂肪，油及其他若干種稀少物品之管制權，至一九四九年六月以後，目前之管制權將於本月底失效。衆院銀行委員會僅通過展期一個月。</p>

<h3>赫爾回憶録（二十五）</h3>
<p>— 北美報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室</p>
<p>侵略之箭扣在弦勢在必發</p>
<p>一月二十七日，格魯自東京來電給我稱：駐日秘魯外交代表會告訴他，說是他（秘魯代表）自許多方面（包括某日本方面）聽到，日本武裝隊伍在美日兩國發生「糾紛」時，將突然集體襲擊珍珠港，而且說在這次襲擊中，日本將使用各各武器。秘書代表告格魯稱：他認為必須把消息傳遞出來，謬。翌日，我們把電報內容轉給陸軍和海軍部。</p>
<p>大約正在這時候和這種環境下，有兩位天主教神父自日本返美，一位是紐約外國天主教協會會長華爾許主敎，另一位是特勞脫神父。</p>
<p>他們報吿說：曾與許多有地位的日本人（包括松岡）談過；他們知道兩國關係已趨緊張，要劣的局勢，將接踵而至。他們都具有可以使人攢揚的願望，以老百姓的資格盡其能力，防阻戰爭。</p>
<p>一方面，他們與美政府中最有權力的天主敎徒郵政總長華爾克接觸，另一方面又與日本大使誼的官員晤談。</p>
<p>總統與我同意由華爾許主敎與特勞脫神父以純粹私人資格，繼續與日大使館維持接觸，並設法把日方的想法用文字紀錄下來。但是我們覺得在日本新任大使野村未到達華盛頓以前，我們本身不能採取任何行動。</p>
<p>野村大使於二月十二日第一次訪問我。他是高大健康，具有誠　的臉孔，與普通日本人的體格大不相同。他的英語，有時候還好，有時候則不甚熟練。他的特質是嚴肅，但很多時候，他又作不快樂的笑容和鞠躬。我認爲野村對於防免美日戰爭的努力，很是誠摯。</p>
<p>我於三月八日與野村在我的卡爾登公寓住所，作第一次長談。這是珍珠港事變前我們所舉行的五十至六十次談話中的第一次。談話都在夜間舉行，地點在我寓所閱書室，起先在卡爾登旅舍，後來又在華德曼花園飯店。野村寗願到我的寓所，而不願到國務院，以便儘最使我們的談話避免刋載在報上。</p>
<p>在這些討論中，曾有許多直率的詞句，但是我們聲喉，從未超過談話聲調水準。野村彬彬有禮，我們留的私交很是融洽。</p>
<p>我們最初的幾次談話，祗限於我和野村兩個人，以後包括我的和野村的顧問。</p>
<p>國務院出類拔萃的日本專家勃倫丹，總是在晚間七點四十五分到我的寓所來，帶來各種需要的文件，與我討論。野村與他的顧問在八點三十分前趕到，談話時常繼續到十點，有時候十點半。勃倫丹然復回至國務院，準備談話的備忘錄。</p>
<p>由華爾許主敎，特勞脫神父及郵務長華爾克主特與日方代表（包括野村大使）進行的非正式談話，至四月九日已有了頭緒。在那一天，我從他們接到參加者所已經同意的建議草案。在以後數天內，我與國務院內的遠東事務專家細心的審閱其內容。</p>
<p>當我們研究建議的時候，我們的失望很大。建議並不是我們所想像的那樣易於容納；大多數的條例，都是那些激烈日本帝國主義者所能够期望的。</p>
<p>由郵務長華爾克轉來的建議，經我們的遠東專家和我審查完竣之後，我的結論是：有若千點是應該予以反對，還有若干點可以照其原意接受，另有若干點，則可經修正後予以接受。我覺得凡是可以促成與日方進行大規模談判的任何機會，都不應予以忽視。因此，我邀請野村到我新搬進的華德曼花園飯店庽所來看我。</p>
<p>我向野村聲明，我已接獲關於解決我們兩國間糾紛的非正式建議，並補充說我知道日大使本人也參加計劃，並獲悉其內容。</p>
<p>野村迅速答稱：他完全明暸文件的內容。他雖然還沒有呈交其政府，但深信他的政府會予以贊同的。</p>
<p>兩天後，我在我的庽所把一個包括四項基本原則的聲明交給野村。我對他說明在我們可能達成的協議中，必須着重這四項原則。四項原則的內容如次：</p>
<p>（一）尊重每一及所有國家的領士完整和主權。</p>
<p>（二）支持不干涉他國內政的原則。</p>
<p>（三）支持均等原則（包括貿易機會均等）。</p>
<p>（四）不更變太平洋原狀，但以和平方式改變原狀，則不在此例。</p>
<p>我對野村說：在這四項原則被接受之後，假使他把美日雙方私人所準備的非正式文件呈給其政府，而假使他的政府予以批准，並且訓令他向我們提出，那末，它就可以成爲開始談判的基礎。</p>
<p>野村把四月九日的文件，連同我的四點與其他意見，轉呈東京，於是我們坐候日方的答復。</p>
<p>五月七日，野村又到我的腐所來，他提出一個來自日政府的建議；主張美日兩國應即締結不侵犯協定。毫不遲疑的，我迅速把這問題擱置一旁。我說：「這與你的四月九日文件，完全是兩件事情。除了用作談判基礎的基本原則之外，我國政府不想考慮其他。」</p>
<p>野村又說他已接獲松岡的電報，但指出內容有許多是「錯誤的」。他問我他是否可以把電報交給我。我想了一會，然復對他說：「旣然這裏面有許參錯誤，假使他有權力做的話，還是請他把電報保留爲妙；因爲，誠如他所顯示：松岡的電文已拒絕四月九日文件的大部份或很多部份，因此是不會有什麼進展的。」野村於是乎就收回了那封電報。</p>
<p>事實上，我們已經知道電報的內容。這裏面包括松圖給我的聲明，據說德義領袖深信必可獲得勝利，美國參加歐戰，僅能使其延長，造成文明的毀滅，並且又說明日本不能損害她的盟國的地位。　我們怎樣會知道電報內容的呢？事實上，我們陸軍與海軍的密碼專家憑其超趣的技巧，已把日本電碼譯出，截接東京致給華盛頓及其他首都的政府電報，將其譯出，呈交國務院參考。</p>
<p>這些截獲的電報，把我們的電碼名稱做「魔術」。在最初談判中，這些電報所佔的地位很少，但在最後階段中，則甚爲重要。從這些電報中，我們探悉日外相給野村和其他日本代表的訓令，同時也可審查野村是怎樣的把他和我們談話的內容，報吿東京。這些電報顯示日本在與我們談判和平的時候，也仍積極推展它的征服計劃。我看到這些電報，正像我看到一個證人反駁他自己的案子一樣。我當然要非常的謹愼，不要使野村絲毫知道我們已具有這種特別的情報。我必須注意到，我們的談話祗限於我從他那裏或是正常外交方面所獲到的消息。爲保證這些電文的安全起見，我委派本人秘書之一予以處理和保存，保證必須把它們歸還海軍部或是予以毀滅。</p>
<p>五月十二日，野村以完全新的文件交給我，這是日方所草擬的協定，並附有各項建議的「口頭解釋」。</p>
<p>我們現在已經獲到日方的正式建議。截至五月十二日，已奠定了談判的基礎，談判一直繼續着，直至珍珠港事件爆發，其中僅中斷一次。</p>
<p>從文件中放射出來的希望之光，是非常的少。日本所建議的，大多數都是對她本身有利。事實上，它要求美日共同在太平洋保持優越的地位，而日本祖任的是男爵地位，籲括百份之九十的人口與財富，很少顧到其他國家的權益。</p>
<p>直率的拒絕，不啻放棄我們數月來所獲到的唯一的眞正機會，從事與日方在基本上討論我們之間的懸案。</p>
<p>結果，我們決定依照日方的建議，進行談判。</p>
<p>當日本政府發覺我們情願把五月十二日的建議，充作討論基礎之後，他們立即開始行動，不是依照我們的方向提出更多和洽建議，而部是與我們的方向，背道而馳。建議內容一改再改，以致更為符合他們和他們軸心同盟的帝國主義野心</p>
<p>對於日本所計劃的一切，我們具有極確實的情報。表面上，帝國會議已於七月二日在東京舉行；接着，驚人性質的軍事步驟也就開始。一百至二百萬人被召入伍，日本商船突然自大西洋召回，日本國內實施限制旅行，並嚴格檢查郵件與通訊。所採取的各種步驟，表示日本已在準備大規模的戰爭。</p>
<p>實際上，我們所截獲的日政府電報，也給我們同樣驚人的消息。七月二日自東京發至柏林的電報，包括關於政策的激烈節段如次；</p>
<p>（一）本帝國決追隨促進世界和平的政策，不論世局如何變化，決心建立大東亞共榮圈。</p>
<p>（二）帝國政府將繼續努力，結束中國事變，並將採取南進步驟，以便為本身建立鞏固的自存自衛基礎。</p>
<p>同日，松岡給野村的電報云：「南進的準備將予加强，對越南與泰國（暹邏）所已決定的政策，決予以實施。至於德蘇戰爭，雖然三個軸心的精神應予維持，但目前必須準備一切，以自己的方法，應付局勢。同時，外交談判應在極端議愼下進行。雖然應該用盡各種方法防免美國參戰，但必要時，日本將依照三强公約行動，並決定在什麼時候和怎樣的使用武力。</p>
<p>在此不久以後，日軍於七月廿一日進佔越南的南部，握有整個的法國戰略省份，好像一只互大的大姆指，向着菲律濱，馬來亞與荷屬東印度。</p>
<p>五月廿三日，威爾斯在白硫磺泉打電話給我，說是野村請求與他會談，問我怎樣的對野村講。</p>
<p>我吿訴他：侵略越南南部，看上去好像是日本在南太平洋大規糢進攻前的最後一個步驟。我說：日本旣然在談判聲中進攻越南，我認爲殊無繼續談判的理田。　咸爾斯狠有力的把道些評語告訴野村，並吿訴他我已決定結束我們的談判。</p>
<p>自此以後，我們對日本的主要目標，就是要給我們本身以充分的時間，從事準備防禦。</p>

<h3>青松邊境痛殱殘匪　安荘附近擊斃十三名俘獲數十　傳匪首丁錫山亦已格斃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕流竄靑松邊境之小股匪軍，連日經國軍及地方自衛部隊淸剿後，已分成兩股，一股由鳳凰山向安莊竄逸，業經駐軍包圍殲滅，除十三名當塲擊斃外，並俘獲四十四各，聞擊斃之匪徒中，經認出匪苜丁錫山亦在其內。另一股仍在天馬山一帶流竄，現已爲當地軍隊緊密包圍，不難全部加以殲滅。本市警備部昨日曾首次發出公報，證實此事。</p>
<p>在浦南登陸之丁錫山部少數共匪，一股係由丁錫山親自串領，約五十餘人，在天馬山一帶流竄。前日下午一時該批股匪突又於鳳凰山出現，當經追擊部隊跟踪進剿，匪即越天聖莊南經　澳鄕尙安莊方面逃逸，欲竄入澱山湖。惟靑浦縣部隊早已於事前完成部署，將澱山湖各港口自珠街閣以迄章練塘，全部封鎖，靑浦縣長劉勁並與民衆自衛隊大隊長王嘉良早至珠術閣指揮一切，靑沛縣城方面亦徹夜警戒，電燈通宵未滅（平時供電祗至夜十二時止）。直至昨晨拂曉，匪抵安莊附近，先遺遺三人（一着便服二穿灰色制服）冒稱第三淸剿區及松江自衛隊部隊，强拉民船命其載大隊入湖，船夫當以湖面不靖，恐難通行爲辭，請其先與安莊駐警接洽，匪聞安莊已有駐警，知有準備，即擬返身，詎安莊水警隊已得訊追出，發槍追擊，匪不敢　戰，向尤浜（距靑浦卅里，距安莊五里）竄逸，時三區保安副司令朱長忠已親率保安部隊趕到，靑年軍第×團團長高道興，副團長邢祖援，第×營張營長，及靑浦保安第二中隊朱隊長，亦各率部隊趕到，於是對匪徒進行大包圍，在南尤浜，北尤浜，草網圩三角地帶內展開激戰，三區專員謝承炳斯時亦趕到，偕松靑兩縣縣長親自督戰，匪衆俯伏河沼間澤地頑抗，戰鬥計歷六小時，國軍發砲轟擊，匪始不支，至下午二時五十分全部瓦解，除十三名經當塲格斃外，其餘四十四名盡被俘獲，國軍方面傷亡官兵各一。聞斃斃之匪徒中經認出丁錫山亦在其內，匪屍及俘獲之匪徒，將於今日移解靑浦。謝專員及朱副司令昨晚宿靑，徹夜會同各部隊長官商討處理辦法及繼續淸剿計劃。至繳獲之武器，尙在淸查中，聞已確定者爲輕機槍三挺，湯姆生槍三枝。</p>
<p>惟昨下午四時許，據報靑浦縣屬北干山東沈塔涇，突又發現另股共匪，係由松江天馬山方而竄來，約有五十餘人，携有輕機槍八挺，似欲向和尙涇移動，北干山附近各鄉鎭聞訊後，即出動自衛隊搜索，並分區堵擊，匪徒見形勢不利，即在和尙涇强徵民船五艘，急向夭馬山同竄。據當局觀察，匪之所以急欲乘船回竄，因天馬山附近大港較多，移動較便。惟昨晚謝專員劉縣長等已命抽調尤浜區部隊趕往追剿，預料今日可全部殲滅。</p>
<p>備戒森嚴之靑浦縣城（本報攝）</p>
<h3>松江各界緊發動勞軍</h3>
<p>松江縣城方面，於下午三時半接獲捷報瞬即傳遍全城，民衆莫不歡欣鼓舞，松江各界發動勞軍運動，由三區公署視察農彼得主持，截至目前已籌得二千萬元，農視察於下午五時訪參謀主任熊開御接洽犒賞此次剿匪有功部隊。</p>
<p>據熊參謀主任談：丁匪侵擾之企圖，我方在數月前已得情報，三區所屬浦南各縣，曾於一月份舉行大淸查，遂戶搜查，當時拘獲匪方隱匿份子不少，均送各該縣府感化，此次匪徒登岸，未有當地土著響應，足證丁匪在浦南一帶之舊有潛勢力已被剷除，不能發生作用矣。</p>
<p>至於另一匪首湯景豐，率有殘匪十餘人，前日曾在浦南烟墩頭一度出現，惟昨經當地自衛隊等前往搜索，竟一無所獲，湯匪可能夤夜得間渡江至浦北與天馬山殘匪結合，惟目前尙無法證實湯匪是否確在天馬山一股之殘匪中。</p>
<p>巡羅護路</p>
<p>滬杭鐵路上海至松江嘉興段昨日仍出動交警路警終日巡邏戒備，預防散逸匪徒破壞鐵路。石湖湯附近因接近安莊，禾松警務負責人，昨均駐石湖蕩站，以防萬一。</p>
<p>獲三疑犯</p>
<p>因餘犯未靖，松江城昨晚六時起仍戒嚴，松屬存仁鄉自衛隊，昨日拘獲一嫌疑犯，據供：名徐明甫，蘇北興化人。駐莘莊站交警機槍中隊前日亦曾拘獲企圖購票去嘉興之共匪嫌疑犯兩名，身上曾抄出乾糧。</p>
<h3>傳已格斃之丁錫山</h3>
<p>匪首丁錫山，奉賢莊行人，戰前爲當地著者名綁匪。民國廿五年被拘入獄，抗戰軍興釋出，參加遊擊隊，活躍於浦東·浦南。嗣後投僞，任僞暫編十三師師長，所部駐松江。北橋·浦南一帶，聲勢活大，浦江兩岸無有不知其名者。其後又企圖反正，爲日軍發覺，拘捕入獄，由李逆士羣保釋，轉輾入自由區受訓，於勝利前數月率隊潛進奉賢，復員整編，丁編入交警隊。去夏因案爲國防部明令通緝，丁遂秘密投匪，嘯聚舊部，赴蘇北匪區受訓。</p>

<p>— 李漢魂</p>
<p>國會之母</p>
<p>得大使館之先容，承國會特派職員招待引導，並由使館　秘書潤明陪伴，同往參觀此世界「國會之母」。初抵倫敦，對此雄峙太晤士河畔，玲瓏凹凸有若麻石構成之偉麗建築物，早已心焉嚮往，故特留心察看。</p>
<p>首進大門，兩邊石像排立，似在保護國會之尊嚴與靜穆。再進，則見圓頂空穹，氣　雄偉。上繪三島人物，可稱佳妙。左右甬道漫長，壁畫羅列，美不勝收。此外，復多名畫及雕刻。上院在左，陳設之物呈紅色；下院在右，陳設之物基綠色。紅綠相間象徵時空之急迫與鬆弛。盎格撒遜民族，即在此自然景色間表示其民主政治之氣勢。載瞻衡宇，胸次廓然。</p>
<p>先觀下院。因原址被炸，尙未修復，故暫用上院議塲爲集會之所。議長席在上，議員相向坐於兩旁。政府黨在右，反對黨在左，普通稱反對黨爲左派，義從此起。議員之無座位者，則坐於下方橫凳，或站立。此簡樸輕鬆之佈置，掌握大不列顚王國之民主運命，且爲歷史樹立楷模，令人徘徊不忍即離。</p>
<p>次訪上院。因議塲借予下院，故在一不甚宏大的廳中暫設議塲。上爲王后座位·王位高而后位低，蓋起於身軀修偉之維多利亞女皇，相沿未改，是殆過於我國王朝之恪守祖制也。右爲太子席，前爲議長席，兩旁爲議員席。陳設甚簡單。</p>
<p>談塲代替戰塲，唇舌代替槍彈。余久經戰陣，尙能領略戰塲滋味；惜未能躬逢其盛，一賭此國會之母唇槍舌劍神氣，憮然有間，導者知余有所感，故多方爲之說明議院拍桌　椅以及下院與王室辯難爭可諸活劇。又稱，如將中國戰塲之熱烈情况移至議塲，則中國國會將比英國國會更熱鬧。余唯默然。</p>
<p>先後參觀兩院　書館，發現其所藏自一千七百餘年至今之全份太晤士報，按年裝成巨册，蔚爲大觀，深贊其保藏意義之重要。法制之書，應有盡有。英國議會立案，事實與理論並重，歷史與現實齊觀。盎格撤遜民族，旣能深思又能實用，此於國會圖書收藏之富與議案訂立之精可以見之。</p>
<p>在大廳之兩側，分繪有納爾遜及惠靈吞激戰拿破侖畫。歷史不滅，偉續長存，數百年後　，初栩如生。</p>
<p>溜覺各　室後，於下層某廳，見地下鑲有一「無罪人」之銅碑。據導者謂，因往時有一無罪之人，長跪受王審問，其結果是無罪·後於跪審處鑄此以爲紀念。且此類之紀念物尙多。足微文化不滅，眞理亦不滅也。</p>
<p>嗣至後面，有廣闊之議員休息所。下爲太晤士河。左望市府，右臨醫院，（一連七座），長橋兩座，頗似北平中南海之金鰲玉　，氣象萬干。　進出大門，昂視世界最高之四方塔。塔上有大時鐘，長針達十四英呎，短針凡九呎，乃一八四二年所製，時計準確，年差祗三分之一秒。在未用電鍊以前，每週一三五需兩人各用五小時方能上鍊，其大可以想見，此亦足爲　麗之國會增色。</p>
<p>科學館</p>
<p>由於交藝復興，宗敎改革與啓蒙運動等，使宗敎與封建之歐洲，蛻變爲科學與工業之歐洲；而此科學與工業又在安居靜處，數百年來不用大流血方法，逐漸使王室政治走上近代民主之路的英國，最先開花與結果。因歐陸之不安，十七·八·九世紀的歐洲科學家，多由大陸移居印國。由科學原理　變至舟實用科學，機械被發明，因而工業革命在十九世紀之加產生於英倫三島。爲尋求此解放歐洲文明生活及拯救世界困窮之科學原理與應用之迹象，故與菊芳邀同昭掄探訪近代文明搖籃之英倫科學館。</p>
<p>蒸汽機爲推動近代文明最先之工具參觀一七九七年發明之蒸汽機，想見近代動力之　大。應用蒸汽機於紡織，使英國最先成功最大之輕工業　家；應川蒸汽機　運　，在英或最先　即火車　汽船。由輕工業進一　重工業。迨十九世紀中葉，英國之輕重工業已睥睨世界而有屆一指，以交通工業作媒介，運輸輕重工業所生產）之貨物，故自十　紀中葉以後，世界各　滿印　國商人之足跡。科學　描　英國科學與工業發　之輪廓，參　旣竟，如讀一部科學與工業進化史。</p>
<p>爲保護工商　　　　達，戰爭用　接踵而來。單　飛機而言，在科學館中，便不難窺見其進步之跡象。館出置一九〇三年飛機，乃最初製成之一架；又以一九〇七年式與一九〇八年式之逐步改進，其駕駛員由臥倒而起立而轉向前之姿態，足見飛機　駛　術亦　製造而俱進。嗣參觀一九一七年之單翼式機與一九一八年之水上式機，以及此後之各年各式，益知此業之日新月異，精進不已。今日巨型飛機之雄飛宇內，探奇攬勝，無遠弗屆，並非偶然。飛機在運輸與戰爭歷史上有其最重要之任務，館中陳列，已作極有力之說明。</p>
<p>鈾之　現，原子能之　明，以及其他科學原理之　展，館中陳列豐富，並具簡單扼要之說明。惜予非科學家，不易知其奧妙。以電影描述原子能相碰之景象，在美國尙不易看見昭掄化學專家　此特感興趣。</p>
<p>適値百年化學紀念，在館之頂樓另闢專室陳列。見某種光綫投射於某種品質而發生各種特殊之顏色，令人想及電影歌舞中五色繽紛之現象。</p>

<h3>豫鄂皖湘贛五省民衆組訓　實施工作在推進中</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌十六日訊〕「剿匪第一，軍事第一，民衆組訓，自應配合剿匪軍事之需要，協助防堵共匪之流竄，並澈底淸剿散匪，鞏固地方治安。」這是白崇禧部長對豫鄂皖湘贛五省剿匪計劃中民衆組訓的第一個原則。他對民衆組問題，特別重視，白氏初蒞九江策劃五省剿匪軍事時，在其辦公室對記者暢談，「今後如何消減劉伯誠匪軍時　，更强調蔣主席在民國廿年剿匪時的名言：「三分軍事，七分政治」，他認爲今後的剿匪，必定要爭取民衆的協助，着重「政治剿匪」，所以，他對於民衆組訓，主張要普遍，深入迅速有效，務使人人納入各項組織接受訓練，人人均參與戡亂工作，並應在時間及空間上，顧　人民生活，使其樂　接受。憑他曩昔在桂省從事　衆組訓工作的</p>
<p>經驗與認識</p>
<p>這次五省主席在南京舉行聯防會議時，有關民衆組訓的實施辦法，就是他親自草擬決定的。他在該項實施綱領中，主張有關民衆組織方面，應視其性質及現時需要，由督導及執行機關，酌派人員參與其內部工作，使於無形中發生領導作用，訓練方面，應先就各組織的領導及重要協助人員着手，以便起示範作用，然後再展開一般訓練。</p>
<p>國防部儿江指揮部現正依據白氏的民衆組訓原則頒佈豫鄂皖湘贛五省民衆組訓實施綱領，其內容：（甲）民衆自衛隊之組訓與使用，（乙）一般民衆之組訓。</p>
<p>各區鄉鎭保的甲乙級壯丁，將盡數　造人區鄕鎭保自衛隊名册，其常備隊（已脫離生產而由縣市給與者）至少應有一大隊（轄三中隊）另行編組。</p>
<p>自衛隊幹部</p>
<p>除任用軍官總隊　交各省轉業人員外，儘量起用退役在鄕優秀軍官，其每月薪給除已由國家發給一半外，並按縣級待過洽與之，如有不遵者，取消其國家待遇。</p>
<p>自衛隊的武器，除縣市所有者外，各鄉鎭公有及人民私有者，一律予以登記，就其本縣市編組，用以保衛地方，民有私槍，中央絕對保障其私有主權，軍政機關不能以任何理由提取，或假借任何名義，改編爲省的團隊或國防軍，如果因剿匪作戰所損失或損壞，由省政府賠償，彈藥　消耗，應檢彈壳具報，由中央撥還，所有縣市區鄕鎭保甲及人民私　武器，一律應登記編組，至若藏匿武器不報請登記，不　命編用，則一律由縣市政府沒收之，並以私藏軍火論罪。</p>
<p>民衆自衛隊</p>
<p>以　縣市境或行政督察專員區內使用爲原則，至常備自衛隊在必要時，得由各該省保安司令或綏靖區司令官，調遣至隣接各該行政督察專員區之縣市境，協助軍隊或隣區團隊，擔任防守警戒淸剿之任務，調離本縣境時，一切給予，仍由原　市發給，加因故陣不　按時接濟，得由所在地之縣市政府借給，事後由其本縣市政府負責撥還。</p>
<p>常備隊及鄕鎭保之武　隊，以精神敎育，射擊訓練，戰鬥演習，工　構　，野外勤務，及行軍爲主，各種任務隊，則　其性質，酌予各項技術上之訓練，惟訓練時間地點，須顧及人民生活之便利，各省（區）保安司令部，對於此項訓練，須負責計劃督導，各綏靖區司令部，各地　備司令部，各地師團管區司令部及駐一軍，均有指導並協助之責。</p>
<p>各省對於隣接匪區與沿江沿河縣市，及山岳三角地帶，與邊險地區之人民自衛隊，應首先充實其組織與訓練，並加强中心城寨江防河防及重要據點之防禦工事，對於各通路，渡口，及要點，須日夜輪流守望，以阻止匪探及散匪之侵入。（本報記者劉藻）</p>

<p>首由主席摘要報吿會務，該會自卅五年七日籌備成立，十八閱月中，會務波折甚多。卅</p>
<p>六年中全年拆放，以十月間之八九億爲最高額，仍以不接濟營運資金爲原則，拆放以公庫證爲對　，以一天爲期，轉期不過三次。全年拆放款，合計達二二，三六八，四〇〇萬元。全年分担經費數額，合計九七六，八五〇，一八三元。卅六年年終準備財產總計三，一八九，一〇〇萬元。公庫　總計二，二三二，三〇〇萬元。惟該會公庫證，在卅六年上半年期，由一〇五億調整至二二三億，此後久未調整，在物價增漲，存款增進之局勢下，該會頗感未能競職。</p>
<p>聯即開始討論（甲）通過卅六年度上下期決算案。（乙）通過執委會提會員行莊自由認繳基金案共五項:　（一）在存款總額百分之一範圍以內，由各會員行莊自由認繳，不加限制，作爲本會第二基金。　（二）第二基金，由本會發給保管證，包括在領用公庫證額數以內，如遇交換差出時，得向本會抵借。　（三）第二基金在未經拆出時，依照中央銀行同業定期存款利率，按月一角二分計息，如數歸原存行莊收益，抵借時停計存息，不照拆款計息，不列入拆放月報。</p>

<h3>業外刺激引起買風　華股臨收形勢俏利</h3>
<p>華股昨業外刺激濃重，證劵帮紗布帮重起買風，銀行帮雖賣，繼續逐步反動，永業華豐漲達限度，臨收形勢十分悄利</p>
<p>晨初以報載美貸及環境助賣，開出即疲，永紗以八〇五元及八〇一元，現遞倒掛登塲，開後二二四號等出即交，六五號等出遞交，即跌至七八九元及七九〇元。七三號等進即交，一八三號並進遞交，回升至八〇三元及八〇五元，三六號等脫手即交，八九號等尙賣遞交，又降爲七九二元及七九四元。一三號等進即交；九七號等買遞交，塲外息價低至二角二分半及二角七，回升至八一八元及八一六元。六九號等尙賣即交，二〇七號仍供遞交，降爲八〇七元及八一〇元，但以業外市價若紗布等大悄，銀根鬆動之至，現遞永紗時呈倒掛，一五七號等進　交，八號等進遞交，近午漲到八三〇元及八三一元高價，午收爲八二四元及八二六元。小型股回升者以景福最爲俏利，較前收即交股永紗信和榮豐統益中絲華豐中紡微升，商務景福勤興尙平，餘均微挫。遞交股永紗信和華豐微升，勤興尙平，餘均微挫。</p>
<p>後市遞交循例停市，即交永紗自八柜五元起，遙二〇號等雖出，二二四號等進至八四九元，一八一號等脫手，退至八三八元。外股及紗布助買甚烈，人心仍俏，而三一號等進至八五二元，國行差進不少，一五六號等供售退爲八四〇元。一五七號等進至八五〇元收市。華豐掛漲停，永業亦迫限度。結果較晨收計即交股華豐永業漲停，榮豐升一成不到，永紗信和美亞景福勤興閘北商務各漲半成，餘均微升。塲外各未上市股票，平穩逾恒。</p>
<h3>統債邁進　外股上升</h3>
<p>公債昨不定中仍吿邁進，統丙晨開八萬九，先見七萬五，再漲到九萬元高價，而後以盤局結束，成交約六百萬元。結果較前收計甲乙丙各漲二千元，了戊各好五千元。</p>
<p>外股昨買風擴大，港電之縮，使熱股咸創新高價，證劵帮賣出，廣帮及洋行帮均進。怡紗晨開六六萬，逐漸漲到七四萬左右收市，尤以午後最爲緊俏，較前收訃電話平平，怡紗英聯怡啤船業業廣各漲一成左右，曾德無紙版鋼業各升半成，餘均微漲。</p>
<h3>兩米再創新高價　社局拋米減少不敷門市</h3>
<p>食米雖在經濟警察嚴密注視下，然而漲勢　　演進，再創高峯，社局仍分別在南北市拋售，行家每戶减爲四十石，米店减低至五石，區區之數，不够應銷門市，人心仍堅。况天氣陰雨未停，到貨寥若辰星，塲外價初市一度升至二百十五萬，薄稻曾至二百十萬（非高貨），後聞當局限門售不得逾一百九十八萬，黑市米出路不易，遂見轉軟。白粳回至二百十萬，薄稻羊秈低至二百零五萬，然尙較上日升五萬元。昨日到貨，二市塲連配米共一萬三千二百零六石。</p>
<p>麪粉</p>
<p>猛普疾退，市況上落頗鉅，顯示投機氣氛濃厚。初因米價再昂，及小麥價升爲一百十八萬二千元，漲勢　漫，老車開市九十四萬，兵船九十二萬，大瞳戶見高來吐，有求必供，市乃直洛。老車收市八十九萬，兵船八十七萬，紅蜂八十六萬，除老車軋漲五千外，其餘均半，麩皮回升，大麩五十二萬元</p>
<p>雜糧　升沉不一，黃豆趨軟，苞米平步青蕓，一跳二十萬。紅糧上升十餘萬元，芝蔴貨稀，貨主扳售，菉豆靑島帮及本街均進，疾升十餘萬元</p>
<p>食油　轉平，臨收豆油復轉昂，昨日開市仍極運，因二期戶口油開始在即，本街納胃甚懈，更因黄豆等漲風均已稍戢，人心已轉疲。豆餅平疲，交易不活。</p>
<h3>茶市堅挺</h3>
<p>自舊曆新年休假期滿後，各業均照常開做，而茶葉市况，外銷茶因國內外售價，形成倒懸過程依然岑靜。至於內銷花色，本街與客帮之去化，蟬聯如故，買氣遂仍怒茁。但賣戶一味以產存空虛，抑且受百物上塲之刺激，是以心思益趨佳境喊價，瘋在前進。以迄收市，行情雖吿扶搖直升，然雙方談判終難獲得圓滿，因此交易一無成就。</p>
<h3>臺糖輸日問題　已告解決</h3>
<p>盟總派輸駛高雄裝運</p>
<p>久懸未決之台糖輸日問題，頃已獲得解決。據悉：盟總業已正式電達台灣中央信託局，並已於十四日派日輪日昌丸直駛高雄，十八日可以抵達，將裝臺糖五千至六千噸返日。</p>
<p>按此次臺糖輸日，實爲勝利後最大一批，亦爲中信局於去年三月間，向盟總以每噸二〇〇美元簽訂合約後，其總數二萬五千噸中之第一批。並悉：五月底以前可全部運竣，至遲遲裝運原因，一爲合約簽訂後世界糖價逐步下跌，盟總對裝運事宜未免觀望。再則以我國輪船業公會爲維持航權，曾一度反對以日輪裝運，但基於合同載明（F．O．B）台灣碼頭交貨之規定，不得不採取權宜之計云。</p>
<h3>上海信託公司　增辦新疆匯兌</h3>

<h3>人絲續昂　廠經緊穩</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市先平　昂，結果比上日高七百萬元，一二〇號旭字及金三馬有光，上午開盤九千八百萬元，旋因綢廠開工在即，實銷稍有起色，喊價頻頻上揚，中午收盤，升至一億〇一百五十萬元，下午再呈挺進，收盤喊價六百萬元賣出，最後塲外又降至五百萬元，天橋東洋均隨之而升降</p>
<p>廠經昨市堅穩，全日有二三十包交易，C字等級做開十五包，價仍做一億〇三百萬元，高零擔即期款九千八百萬元，有期頭爲一億元，有十餘包成交。千經去胃較滯，昨日仍乏成交，行情尙稱平穩。</p>

<p>中國紡建公司昨亦循例開紗十五種，共售一一七七件，合廿支紗二〇九三件，申購單共四二七張。</p>
<p>棉紗狂漲</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉紗市况，雖逢紡建公司供售之期，以同業申購頗加限制，籌碼不敷調齊，更聞靑島紗價猛漲，廣帮某大戶乘機扒吸，市上銀根明緊暗鬆，業外拉提仍强，本客兩帮實銷亦暢，市呈求過於供，行情一致狂漲。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開即跳二百八十萬，做七千二百萬元，旋即越喊越高，最高價喊七千八百五十萬元，迨至近收時，紡建雖再度懸脾，奈以人心過俏，市仍挺秀，後因檯而帮有獲利吐售，微見回挫，結果七千八百二十萬元收盤，比上日依然猛竄八百萬元之鉅。其餘各支粗細紗亦均賡續飛騰二百餘萬至六七百萬不一，但較之農歷年底，大都上升達二成至四成之譜。</p>
<p>布疋續升</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開以報載美貸有望，人心稍呈動搖，散戶心虛吐售，市盤趨軟，惟漢口帮及北帮乘似競進，西安帮亦來收吸，染廠因元布士林布等實銷暢旺，更以原料紗價狂跳，紡建配售額量並未增加，上期龍頭細布每戶僅配二十餘疋，且行情亦昂，故結果十二磅龍頭等各細布，續漲八萬五千至十萬元，其餘四君子嗶嘰直貢及漂布斜紋色布士林布等市，亦一致邁進，自五萬至十萬元左右。</p>
<p>現棉上揚</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，人心奇昂，午後因棉紗飛漲，市氣愈悄，散多逢高吐售，交易活絡，各檔齊步上揚，價格好起七十萬至一百萬不等，成交七百十包。　送廠價做開漢細七九三萬六千，棧交價做開漢細七六〇萬五千至七八四萬，漢粗六四四萬八千，沙市八三九萬至八六六萬，脫力司八二六萬七千，彰德七八五萬三千，周浦籽花一八二萬，軋升十二萬元，</p>
<p>絲紗織品無一不漲</p>
<p>絲紗織成品如羽紗·袖裡綢·花洋布·防雨布·白帆布·蔴膠布·法西襯·灰軟襯等，昨市無不紛紛上升，蓋因絲紗原料高漲，成本扯高，廠方扳硬，以致無一不升。絲光羽紗昨成交二百餘疋，頭號每碼價九萬五千元，二號八萬二千五百元，三號七萬元，四號六萬四千元，袖裡綢售九萬元至十四萬元，法西襯三萬八千元至五萬元。</p>
<h3>自備外匯到埠貨物　政府決強制收購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府決根據動　法令，强制收購自備外匯到埠貨物中與國防有關之物資，由中央信託局負責辦理。該局現定今日召開審議會，商討收購之細則。此次强制收購後，將配給國防部，而不似過去之售與商人。收購之加成數，將减爲百分之十五。至西藥配售手續，亦經決定於一個月內，由原申請配售之進口商，轉售於國防部。</p>
<h3>我食盬輸出數量　目下尚未能決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局對日易貨貿易，渦去素以食鹽爲輸出品大宗，本年該局尙擬提早輸日之食鹽數量，惟近據鹽政局方面消息：現因華北局勢不安，運輸不能暢通，各產區之產量及運輸，一切無法預計，因此食鹽外銷數量，此時亦難事先決定。故中信局所要求之數量，亦須假以時日，始能核定。</p>
<h3>輸管招待新聞界　說明兩季限額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四第五兩季進口限額，經全國經委會審査後，已於十七日經行政院通過，輸管會頃已接到院令，定今日午後三時招待新聞界有所說明。兩季之總額，共爲七四七二美元，每季平均三千七百萬美元以上，較之第四季約低百分之三十。但肥料煤炭米麥等項均未列入，將來可斟酌實際需要情形，隨時核定。棉花限額則自第四季起，即未列入一。如加上以上各貨物之進口數字一，並未比第四季爲少，至外匯限一額之分配中，以油類居首位。</p>
<h3>同業存款月息　提高至一角五分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行舉辦之同業定期存款，月息原爲一角二分，茲以適應同業之需要，決自今日起，提高至一角五分。至於七天之期限及單位一億之規定，均無所變更。</p>

<h3>繁榮一毀滅</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>—〔原子能與宇宙及人生〕讀後</p>
<p>G.Gamow著　陳忠杰　舒重則譯　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>從前有個悲觀哲學家寫過一篇故事：一個萬能的主人設計了一座美麗而完備的花園送給一羣孩子們去玩賞，最初他們很安分，盡心的欣賞享受，慢慢他們爭吵起來了，於是企圖用着許多方　來互相搶刧和霸佔，忘却了享受，整天嘶呌着，毆打着，用盡了辦法來互相攻擊，終而被他們發見了火這個可怕的武器，在他們一次的衝突中互相縱火攻擊，終而火毀減了這莊麗的花園，也　個結束了這些不安分的性命。　是個寓言，今天把它說出來實。有着極沉重的意義的。人類從　占開始奮鬥起，控制了水，又　　了火，一步步向宇宙的神秘　　險發　，終而握着了這一切　量的根源——原子能，這是一　了不起的發現，給人類帶來了　訊和噩耗，不繁榮即毁滅，兩條　路明顯的要讓人類趕快運用　　的智　來抉擇了。</p>
<p>工業　命　人類帶來了新的動力，也給人類帶來了新的遭遇，　的迅速發展，使一些社會科　家來不及來解救這些新遭遇。　　過剩，勞工問題，殖民地間題，一些不愉快的事便接踵着鬧了過去大半個世紀。今天這可怕的事又來了，社會科學家趕不上自然科學家，當遍地正散佈着仇　，爭吵和戰爭時，他們帶來了一個含有危險的東西，一今之差，它就　　一把大火能把這個莊　　，花園燒得毀滅殖溢。政治家們要趕快奔跑了，因為你們和科學家的距離太遠。</p>
<p>人們常用愛「原子時代」兩個字，但這是個什麼時代？它代之心　的意義？我們相信大多的人的觀念是非常模糊的，特別在中國，科學還在追人後面的時期，對它的了解更可憐了。因之，　們特別介紹出一本討論原子能一切問題的書給續者，誠如作者在他的序言說：「本書將對原子能問題作一個完全而連貫的描述，並將回答：它是什麼？它從何一處來？和怎樣可以善用它？諸問題。」作者加談（G.Gamow）是美國華盛頓大學的物理學敎授，他在原子核物理上的優異成就使他有資格來談這些問題。而且　謨敎授是頗具風趣的，在討論許多莊嚴而玄奧的問題時，總愛用極生動的例子來此喩使你在了解上有很大的帮助。而且那些有趣的挿圖更使你印象深刻。國內近來對原子能問題一類的書介紹的不算少，但大半分爲兩類，一類是純學術討論性的，除了極少對近代物理有極好的基礎的人讀外，一般人是不敢問津的。另一類是那些不負責任瞎說胡道的東西，讀後反而會混亂你的觀念的。以一個權咸學者而用極親切的口吻來談這問題的，這是第一本。他向人們提出了原子能的偉大和危險，指出了兩條讓讀者自己去抉擇的道路—繁榮與毁滅，而且也建讓了他的宏見。</p>
<p>從遠到一八九六年法國物理學柏克勒爾（Henri　Becguerel）發見了放在抽屜裏的一塊鈾鑛可以使附近的一包照相乾片變黑的作用起，一直說得原子彈在日本的爆炸，再進而描繪一付美麗的遠景，人們將如何利用道偉大的能量去改進他們的生活，一個火箭砲裏儲有一百磅的燃料，利月球上去和其他行星上去。但是他說這有個前　，要全世界的科學家共同合作，集中力量來促進發展，更要政抬家合作，消滅戰爭，把從事於原子彈製造競爭的努力轉後到原子動力利用上去才行。</p>
<p>全書分三大章，第一章解答原子能是什麼？加　敎授是從基本的化學講起，而且用新原理解釋了不少我們已知道的化學變化；把原子核的內部秘密全部供出來。在我們的化學元素中，除了銀以外，其他全能是不安分的，所謂處於「介穩狀態」下，只要有個適當的東西去一衝擊，就會有原子核分裂和熔合的事發生，這發生隨之帶着巨大的能量，所以，加　敎授提出了警吿「我們實是牛活於一個變化莫測的火藥庫裏，那裏面的一切物質，不論是一杯水，一片麵包都裝備着可怕量的能，等待着解放的機會」</p>
<p>地球上的一切能量得之於太陽的輻射，但太陽的能量從那兒來的？原來這也是原子能，利用這個新理論還可解答，許多天文學上的問題，甚至可以找出宇宙的產生的理論來了。最後一章也是最重要的一章，除了告訴這原子彈怎樣有着巨大的破壞力外，作者預料將來的原子彈其破壞性更大，一顆投入海水中的原子彈可以把海洋上的軍艦甩到幾千呎高的空中互相撞毁。但是假使反過頭來利用原子能服役於人類，它將是一個多得力的僕人。最後他用祈禱的口氣向人類呼籲了，「我們生在一個最足驕傲的時代，但我們的責任太大了，人類的繁榮與整個毁滅全操在我們的手中，運用最高的智懇吧？」……『我們希望，原子能最好的重大成功，將是行星探險，而不是人類毁滅。』</p>
<h3>讀〔東方白〕</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>—美國派赴日本教育團報告書—</p>
<p>鄭曉滄譯·三十六年十一月商務初版</p>
<p>自從日本戰敗，協約國除了軍　佔領，解除了他們的武備外，並協助新興的日本致力於政治。經濟。教育文化各方面的革新，希望民主的日本能早日建立，以奠定維護世界和平的基礎。特別是改革日本敎育，更爲愛好和平的人士所關注。教育是民主社會的基層魏築，與整個的民族國家乃至世界關係極大。凡是有識之士，都該知道日本軍國思想的滋長，是和他們過去所施行的軍國民敎育攸關。在其種意義上說，日本過去的教育可說是「成功」的，那成功便表現於他們各種侵略方式上，表現於所謂「建設東亞新秩序」「樹立東亞共榮圈」上。我們要澈底肅淸日本過去的狹義的軍國思想，根除他們偏窄的封建意識和侵略觀念，僅僅解除他們的武奘是不够的，最重要的還是重建日本的教育制度，以廓淸一切危害人類的文化毒素。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞元帥於鎭守日本之翌年，爲了改革日本教育，咨請美國軍部轉請國務院派遣敎育）家二十餘人赴日就地老察。經過專家的再三觀察考慮，在「美國派赴日本敎育團報告書」中提出了許多關於改革日本敎育的寳貴意見，鄭曉滄敎授譯為中文，題名「東方白」，我們從這本書由彷彿看到新興的東亞的文明曙光，已經漸漸透露出來了。</p>
<p>這本報吿書對於日本敎育文化以及政治思想，都可能發生很大的影響，其中理論部分不僅可供“本敎育實施上的參考，亦足以啓發敎育研究的途徑。我國與日本關係最切，此次戰爭我國受審亦最大，在撫摩慘痛的經驗之餘，我們不能不關心他們的敎育改革，我國旣在協約國之列，自然也負有消除他們　武思想的任務，因此我們就不得不重視我們盟邦所建議於日本敎育改革的各點。再有，美國的敎育理論與方法至今仍掌握着全世界。我國過去的敎育制度受美國的影響頗大，戰後甲美關係愈益密切，促進兩國敎育文化思想的交流實在有其必要。從這本報吿書中，我們又可以看到美國敎育的制度及其根本精神，也就不　看到關於美國敎育的一種簡切的說明。</p>
<p>報告書共分六章，事實與意見並重。第一章「日本敎育之目的與內容」，對日本過去敎育的缺陷言之基詳。敎育行政權的過　集甲，使日本教育趨向國家主義與　武主義，爲官僚政客所壟斷。欲改革當前的日本敎育，必須給予敎師以最大的自由。知識敎育應重新估量其價値，課程不應僅爲一種固定的知識，敎學亦不應僅限於指定的敎科書，呆板的考試決不能測出一個學生身心發展的全部活動，學生的個性與才能各異，因才施敎不可忽重。「修身」課有傾向於扶植服從性之嫌，須滲透自由生活的特質，培養兒童和靑年民主理想及平等觀念。廣義　道德應於含有民主思想的學校活動中訓練。史地敎本中的神話應删去，初級學校中多利用鄉土敎材；高級學校應多方提倡客觀的硏究。敎學不應強制接受，而應養成學生審問明辨的讀書態度。對於健康敎學及體育課程，書中亦有推廣的建議。職業教育的科學化，藝術化；「社會硏究」敎學之應發揮創造精神，均曾提及。</p>
<p>第二章「文字改革」，該團尤多精審的硏究，認爲日本文字的改革運動，已屆其時。團員建議引用羅馬字拼音法，但須作有計劃的研究與改革。他們主張成立一個語文委員會，在過渡期間對文字改革負聯絡硏究之職，並擬定計劃，輸入羅馬字拼音制於學校，逐漸推廣於社會。還有，日本的口語式較繁複，亦應使之節化。</p>
<p>第三章「初等及中等兩階段之敎育設施」，針對民主敎育的精神，建議學校行政的革新，應改　權爲分權，市町村及都道府縣兩級創設敎育管理機構，人員由人民投票選舉。此等機關應有權視導學校，檢定敎師，編選敎科書，這些職權，以前統由文部省掌理，今後文部省可處於指導及輔助地位，對地方敎育不必直接統制。强迫教育應增至九年，男女生達十六歲爲止，學費全免。前六年為小學，後三年為初中。初中敷施普通敎育，爲人人而設，課程須富彈性，兼顧職業準備，以上應設三年制高中，免學費，亦須男女同學。私立學校只要能符台最低限度的標準，仍得享有細應得的自由。</p>
<p>第四章「敎育與師資敎育」，給日本敎育工作者指示了一個新的理想。向來敎法上注重記憶，適從，綱常等思想，均應改變。今後應鼓勵學生的獨立思想，人格發展以及民主公民權利與義務的認識。道德敎學徒以訓話格言爲主，必不易受效，必須從學校與社會的具體情境中所得的經驗爲基礎。該團希望現任敎師，均能獲得「再敎育」的機會。師範學校尤應革新，使未來的敎帥，都能貫澈民中的理想。他們認爲目前的師範預悠科應予廢除，目的無非提高程度，加强專業訓練。學校行政人員以及督導人員的專業敎育，與敎師同樣重要大學及其他高級學校，應予敎師及行政人負作高深硏究的種種機會。</p>
<p>第五章「成人教育」，强調新日本成人敎育的重要。主張各級學校應向社會一般人開放。此外大都市須設中心圖書館及其支部，各都道府縣亦須其此項設施。文部省如能設公共岡書事業管理部，更能擴展成人敎育的效能。科學，藝術，頭實業等博物館之敎育的效用，和圖書館一樣。至於各種地方性或專業性的會社，勞工團體，政團也可以使之發揮敎育的力量，敎育廣大的民衆</p>
<p>第六章「高等敎育」，闡述高等敎育之文化的與社會的意義。大學及專科學校應充實內容，予學生硏究自然，社會，藝術，人文等學科的便利，提倡學術及思想的自由風氣。過去日本的高等敎育僅爲少數人的特權，今後應力矯此弊，團員主張高等敎育應任其自由發展，不必過於統制，至多從旁督導輔助而已。對於富有才智而無力入學的靑年男女，應多予資助。廣充圖書館與其他硏究設備及硏究所，亦在建議之中。爲敎授樹立學術自由及經濟保障，主張　除現行文官制。</p>
<p>這本報吿書內由所述雖爲改革日本敎育的方策，實已貫澈民主政治的新理想，和自由主義的新觀點。美國的敎育專家對日本敎育傳統的深切的分析，固然可以給我們研究教育的參考；而其精闢的建議，更表現民主敎育的崇高理想和自由思想的眞正精神。我們應該體味麥帥的這幾句話：「日本人民所施行之敎育改革，最後必有以俾其深切認識一國所處於世界之地位，必期有以促進世界之和平而保障各項人權」。是的，對於戰敗的日本，對於正在復興的日本，應該敎育他們的人民有一個健全的人生觀，社會觀，世界觀。無疑的，整個敎育基礎必須置於民主之上，這是美國敎育思想的主潮，新興日本的敎育文化的歸趨，也是世界敎育理想的極致。這裏許多專家指明日本敎育改革的重點在思想的自由和敎育機會的均等，恰好過去　武主義軍國主義的敎育一個更新途徑。在開始行憲的中國，自然也該汲取一些民主敎育的理想。用這樣的眼光來讀這本報吿書，對於自己該不會毫無助益吧？</p>
<h3>「傲慢與偏見」</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>Pride　and　Prejudice　by　Jane　Aunten</p>
<p>「傲慢與偏見」一書，是一本流行在我國歷久不衰的英語小說。</p>
<p>作者奧斯登，她是以描寫家庭日常生活而著名的作家。一七七五年生於英國漢　縣（Hampshire），父親是本地敎堂的牧師，母親是一個有名的諷刺家的姪女。奧斯登的家裏，有七個兄弟姊妹。她的一生，沒有離開過她溫暖熱鬧的家庭，終身不嫁，在家裏與家人度着寗靜的生活。當她在料　家庭瑣屑的工作後，或者在朝夕的餐後　啃，便利來寫作，作品的內容，幾乎完全是以家庭的生活爲題材。一七九七年，她那年才是二十二歲，寫成了「傲慢與偏見」，隔了十四年後才出版。其他成名的小說，還有好幾　，然以「傲慢與偏見」是她著名的代表作。</p>
<p>奧斯登生前，不大受人注意，但是　在一八一七年逝世後，却大受作家和讀者們的讚揚。文學批評家盧偉斯（G．H．Lewes）說，「與斯登以表現社會生活爲目的，恰到好處。」散文家馬考萊說，「她比任何作家都更近乎莎士此亞。」司谷脫說，「她那　筆神　的描寫和情感的眞實，把日常平凡的瑣事和普通的人物，都弄得非常有趣起來，我自己是趕不上她的。從這些評語中，我們已經明白奧斯登的作品是具有怎樣的價値。</p>
<p>「傲慢與偏見」的故事，是描寫一個鄉村紳士彭乃特家庭裘日常的生活，他的兩個女兒和兩個從英格蘭搬到鄉間寄住下來的靑年，從戀愛而至結婚的經過。故事是那麽　意味深長，　實眞切；在那雷　爾場園邸所進行着的事情，好像就是在我們的　舍間昨天剛發生過似的。我們隨時可以看見，不然的話，便是常常在家庭的問談中，聽見家人談及這樣的事。作者在寫每一個人物的動作，習慣，和說話，沒有一點舖張，沒有過意的修飾做作；我們讀着這本書，自己彷彿正是彭乃特家裏的人，或是達綏的朋友，緊密地與他們接近在一起。這是作者最成功的地方。</p>
<p>書中的男女主人翁達綏，是一個世家子弟，他重視自巴高貴的門閥的觀念，每年家裏有一萬鎊的進款，習慣都市繁華的生活，在他的性格上，天然顯現着一種傲慢的氣色，臉上常露出瞧人家不起的莊嚴的態度。下層階級中所常有的俗氣粗野，他是最看不慣的。但是他也有好處，便時樂於帮助和他一樣有身份的人。女主人翁伊利莎伯，她是鄉紳的姑娘，帶有戶然鄉野的氣質，但是她聽慧機靈，對高貴的貴族階級，雖然是高攀不上，然在寒微中越見其倔强可愛，保持着她的偏見，絕不向人獻媚低頭。</p>
<p>達綏和伊利莎伯的相見，便是傲慢與偏見頡頏的開始，要消除傲慢與偏見，只有在現實的生活實踐上，才能够解決。因此，作者給達綏和伊利莎伯去接受生活事實的敎訓，經過幾次離合悲歡的試煉，他們不能不向覺地誠摯地摒棄了社會環境給他們造成的不良的習性，最後他們才能美滿結合了。這是奧斯登天才流利的文筆，所啓發與暗示給我們的認識。這是特別値得讚頌的。</p>
<p>因爲達綏的傲慢，所以更加强了伊利莎伯的偏見，現在我們且來看看書末達綏府伊利莎伯的說話：「我常有抵抗不住的痛苦回憶闖進我的腦海裏，……我雖沒有抱過自私的主張，但行爲上却是自私了一生。小的時候，大人就吿訴我什麽是對的，可是不吿訴我改正我的脾氣。我雖抱着好的主張，但他們都讓我學他們那些驕傲自負。做了個獨生兒子，我是不幸的呌父母慣壞了。父母自己是好，但是偏讓我，鼓勵我差不多呌我去自私傲慢，除了我家人之外，誰也不管；把天下的人都看成下流，至少是要把他們的見識和價値看得比我的不上。從八歲到二十八歲，我就是這樣。要不是你，我最愛的，最可愛的伊利莎伯，我也許還是要這樣下去的呢！我什麼不是虧了你？你給了我一塲敎調，雖然起初是不容易接受下去，但是這是很有利益的。我是給你敎訓得能够自己適當的貶抑自己了。我那時到你跟前來拿穩了你會接受我的。以前我的奢望是多麼的不配去感動一個値得奉承的女子，也由你敎我知道了。」</p>
<p>這是遠綏的自我表白，我想這也應該是給目前許多知識靑年，寫下了一幅淸澈的畫像。今天，高貴門第中的公子。不知還有多少仍帶着這樣的神氣呢。</p>
<p>戀愛與結婚，只是佔有人生歷程一個小部份，傲慢與偏見，已經不是達到健全的戀愛的橋樑，再從別的生活角度來看，傲慢與偏見，同樣是必須革除的東西。我想奧斯登用動人的故事，說明傲慢與偏見不能存在於戀愛的中間之外，她還指示讀者在別的事業上更多同樣的警覺。</p>
<p>近年來我國硏究英國文學批評者，都特別推許這本「傲慢與偏見」，因爲原文的淺顯，文句工細暢達，很適宜學習英語的人細讀，所以頗多中學裏，採用這本書作爲英文課本。中譯本很久前有燕京大學外文系學生楊繽小姐的譯本，譯筆雖頗忠實，然與原作精美的結構和婉轉的語氣，相差甚遠。我們希望最近能有更好的新的中譯本出版。一本名着，多出版一兩種譯本，自然是很需要的，在這裏我們對翻譯作家，寄以誠　的熱望！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我的舊書店</h3>
<p>— 茂仁</p>
<p>十年以前一有空就去看影戲，以後則一有空就跑舊書店，因為覺得買舊書比看影戲經濟。雖然有所謂科學常識者，警戒我們說舊書不免有毒菌，還是不看爲是，但我覺得世界之大毒菌之多，何處無碰頭的機會，何必於舊書時加迴避。跑舊書店之意一在於得售價較廉的欲得之書，二在於發現聞名已久覿面無緣的絕板書。前者本有辦法不以舊書店爲唯一捷徑，外國的廉價板書恐即在應窮讀書人之需要者。這在中國有外國所無的困難：第一，書的銷路不多，原出版人尙口銷不了若干本，那有多少讀者來買廉價版，第二外國出廉價版之可以廉價，我想一半是從紙張上省下來廉給讀者的，如原版爲厚厚的（不知呌什麽名稱）好紙，廉價版就用薄薄的報紙，而中國則根本就用的報紙，已經省無可省；第三，中國出版家肯否將其銷過若干版的好書出讓別人規規矩矩的（即出版稅或另行致酬）出廉價版，因無前例可援。不過　　有此等困難，我還想勉力一試……</p>
<p>且說我遲早也要一試的我的舊書店，普通舊書店的令人不快之處，是老板或伙計的「吃相難看」，對於去看書或甚至買書的人並無歡迎之意。這或者也有他們的苦衷，物價日漲，一本書明天賣去可得十萬者今天衹値八九萬，不是給顧客便宜了去。雖然明天之後永遠有個明天，要賺個十足衹有藏之名山的一法。但我是去看書買書的，不是看他們的面孔，故一進門即目光注視於架上之書，連揀中一本後論價時還是目不邪視，故對於「吃相」還可對付。論價時才覺得憤憤。有好幾次書非絕版之書，價錢却與新書竟至有過之無不及，或便宜不過一二成，但是你和他們多說是無益的，誰呌你要買？再則他們一本書收下來也許擱個三年五載，不多賺幾個錢怎麼行？</p>
<p>使我覺得最不好過的是舊書店之「殺價」。常見婦人小孩拿了一二包書來求售，面露慚愧之色，結果給殺得羊肉作狗肉賣而去·書一到他們手中，則立刻狗肉變了羊肉。一進一出，獲利甚豐。但求利愈多愈好本是古今中外的通行商業道德，又何能獨責舊書店。</p>
<p>所以我想開一家舊書店。書還是舊書，交易方法却想新一點。例如賣價與買價有個一定，譬如一本書新書售價爲十萬元，我買進來時給賣者一個對折，而出售時則改爲七折。這樣做於我當然還是有利可圖，不過總算公平了點，尤可取者是賣舊書與買舊書的人都有了價値依據，不必一個仰天索價一個着地還價了。此外如常常登登廣吿，使主顧知道有什麽他心愛的書出售，不必常常勞駕，也是與買于舊書者方便之道。</p>
<p>我正在四處找尋舖而，但「頂費」均需以兩或條計，一時尙無實現之可能。那麽且待出頂房子以書計的黄道吉日，再來開張罷。</p>
<h3>訪項羽故里</h3>
<p>— 曼</p>
<p>在血氣方剛時代讀過「項羽本紀」，再加上小說戲劇的渲染，我對於這位叱咤風雲，氣概不可十世的西楚霸王發生了好感。不論他的功罪成敗，他始終是一位了不起的人物，沉舟破釜，烏江自刎，充分表現他英雄的本色。</p>
<p>近以難得的機緣，得能到項王的故里）行，很想訪求一點較書本稍微切實的陳跡。地點是越城西南三十餘環山圍抱中一個小村落，村名項里，戶口並不多，民性樸厚，農作外，多從事錫箔工業，風景地勢，雄偉秀麗。</p>
<p>在熟人的指引下，跨進了「項王廟」（是全村僅有的項王遺跡），是一排五間殿宇，柱不相連，樑不相接，同樣五　，每　並坐着項王和虞姬娘娘的塑像，像身不大，而且項王的　儀，遠不及舞台上的神氣。爲什麼要如此建築呢？因爲此村共分五社，每社各自爲政，互爭意氣，相持不下，便建築成這個樣子。僅這一點，倒有些項羽的倔强氣息。</p>
<p>滿想在廟裏找尋一點碑文作研究資料，非但不可得，甚至述敍述沿革的碑石都沒有；幾方　額，又都是「保佑一方」，「有求必應」之類。如果項王眞的在此執行土地神職　話，眞可說是英雄氣短了！</p>
<p>上小茶寮向野老采訪，所得的僅一些半　小時半　　傳的神話，使人會不相信項羽是眞的人物。一位老者熱心地帶我到山灣的溪邊，給　看溪底一大片有　痕的　石。</p>
<p>他說：「這是金兀朮迫小康王到此地，在溪中洗槍，槍上的血染紅了這石塊，這裂痕，是槍尖刻劃成的。項王在此地抵擋一陣，小康王才得脫險。」</p>
<p>「他們不是同時代人呀？」　不禁失笑了。</p>
<p>「當然是項王顯聖哪！」他不快地轉身就走。感到　常　冷漠與失望，　　然離開了這秀麗的山村。</p>

<p>淸·陳宏謀習學，退養林泉時，每與鄉中父老聚談為樂。至除歲前數日，鄉人多有以春　索書者，陳笑而受之，命　家人各書標誌於紙背。然絕不一書，亦不命其書記代作。屆期鄉人來索聯，宏謀各以故紙還之，鄉人大駭，問：何不寫字？陳曰。「有字（事）不如無字（事）好。」鄉人各欣然携歸，各貼門首。或問曰：何無字？鄉人吿曰：「陳公云：有字不如無字好，故不用字也。」陳聞之，亦大笑。後遂沿以爲俗，至今廣西春聯多貼紅紙不書字。（見小奢麾館脞錄）</p>
<h3>棋話</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>對那些不下棋的人，棋　似乎是乏味的，它需要精力的集中，還要經年累　　硏究。不錯，古梵文中的「棋戲」兩字譯出來就是「智慧的辦戲」的意思——而要做一個棋子專家也的確需要多量的硏究。但是，任何人衹要具有平常的智慧便能够迅速的學會基本的棋法，這是事實。八九歲的小孩子會下棋的不少，而父子隔着棋盤交鋒亦是常事。</p>
<p>說起西洋棋　的起源，一般都認爲　始於印度。有些歷史家說紀元前三千年就有棋子了，埃及的古墓中就發現渦類似棋盤的東西。這些東西也許被用作某種形式的棋戲之用，不過，棋　的更可能的起源是從一種骰子劇演變出來的。我們所有的最可靠的記錄記載：棋子眞正是在紀元七百年左右在印度被發明的。雖然早期的棋　要用骰子來決定棋子的移動，但是，　進迄今，下棋已全憑智力而與僥倖　　緣了。</p>
<p>棋戲的輸入歐洲，大約時在九世紀，可能是由水手先介紹進西班牙或者葡萄牙，然後再傳揚開來的。在起初，一般人都以猜疑的眼光視之，尤其是敎會中的人物。有一個記載說，在紀元一〇六〇年，佛勞蘭斯的主敎嚴厲的禁止在酒店裏下棋，如果有人犯了這種「罪惡」，便會被罰「洗十二個窮人的脚」。這種禁令可能是由於下棋常與打賭相聯所造成的。印度的棋手對一盤棋會以一隻手或者一條腿爲賭注，他們在手邊放着一鍋滾沸的液體，假如一個棋手輸了一個手指，他便迅速的將它砍下，將殘肢灼燙一下，繼續下他的棋—在十四世紀的傳奇中敍述渦另外一個奇特的打賭——輸家需將海中的全部的鹹水喝下肚去。不過，輸家是一個聰明的人物，他要求贏家先把海　的淡水先喝淸，結果，他得以賴掉。</p>
<p>到了十三世紀末，一個對棋戲的壓迫都消失了，下棋成了有間階級的最愛好的消遣品。武士，貴族，詩人，甚至僧侶，一有機會便下棋。貴婦淑女也下棋，並且棋戲被認爲是一種有用的對女性獻股勤的工具——尤其是對不善開口的羞怯的男子更爲有用。不過，男女之間作棋戲並非一定是會諧禮讓的。例如，當佛蘭德斯的　尼下棋贏了她的丈夫時，他竟羞怒的　她以老拳！後來，他在戰爭中被俘了，她爲報復起見，拒絕拿出贖金，結果，害他做了十三年的偽虜。</p>
<p>漂亮的和貴重的棋具當能增加下棋的樂趣。各　　　物院中陳列不少用玉石，象牙，水晶，琥珀，烏木和其他的的貴重的物質彫成的棋子。上面所彫刻的人物花卉，亦多精巧可喜。</p>
<p>棋戲以中世紀最爲流行，可說是達到了空前絕後的巔峯。到了十四世紀末　，紙牌開始問世，成了紕子的輔助品。到了近世，門紙牌已較棋戲更爲流行，這大　是因為牌據的速度比較快，並且參加者不限於兩人，大家可以分攻其樂。不過，棋子並沒有被紙牌海汰　勢，而棋戲之所以能够歷數千年而未見棄，主要的是因爲它是一種公正的遊戲——鬥智而不鬥「運」。</p>
<h3>超級糖精</h3>
<p>— 梅</p>
<p>荷蘭籍科學家范開第教授最近製成了一種新的化合物，可以稱為「超級糖精」，據范敎授說這一種化合物甜的程度超過普通的食糖達五千倍，現在正謀大規模製造。范敎授說這種糖精的成本低康，將來出售時每磅大槪衹需美金四元，而每磅足供普通家庭十年之需。這種新糖精的正式名字是L-n-propoxy-a-amino-4-mitrobenaene。</p>
<h3>忠實信徒</h3>
<p>— 希禮</p>
<p>在蘇格蘭住着一個老年婦人，她深信禱吿是非常靈驗　。一天晚上，有兩個靑年人　聽，到她正在爲麵包而祈禱，這兩個人要尋開心，就買了兩隻　包從她茅屋的烟囱　　進去。第二天，他們又去聽她在禱告裏如何答謝上帝，當她完畢之後，這兩個人哈哈六笑她走了進去，他們吿訴她他們如何把麵包從從煙囱裏丟進來。</p>
<p>但是老婦人的信心絲毫不被　動，她堅信地說道：「麵包當然是上帝賜給我的。不過，她有　是差小鬼們送來罷了。。</p>

        <h1>1948.02.19</h1>
<h3>President Truman's Message to Congress Officially Proposes Aid to China Plan Amounting to $570 Million</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman today presented a special message to Congress, recommending a plan to aid China with $570 million. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>I have repeatedly stated that the establishment of a just and lasting peaceful environment worldwide is one of the primary goals of the United States. This is a principle to which the American people are dedicated.</p>
<p>Since the surrender of Japan, we have made tremendous efforts and provided substantial financial aid to revive the war-torn nations, restoring them to the effective economic systems needed to maintain peace. The principle guiding our aid to the war-torn nations is to help their people help themselves.</p>
<p>To promote this objective, Congress is now carefully considering one of the most important and far-reaching proposals, namely the European Recovery Program.</p>
<p>I now request Congress to consider the assistance that our country should continue to provide to China.</p>
<p>The American and Chinese people have had many years of sincere friendship. There are also long-standing commercial and cultural ties and close cooperation between the two countries. The American people have always admired the Chinese people and deeply sympathize with the various trials and difficulties they have encountered.</p>
<p>The United States has long recognized that the stability of China is crucial to lasting peace in the Pacific and the world. China, due to its large land and population, has become an important factor in international relations. China has excellent traditions and culture, as well as a large and energetic population. We sincerely hope that China will be strong and progressive, making a full contribution to the strengthening of international forces.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government of China twenty years ago, we have continuously supported it. The United States and China were allies in the war against Japan, and we supported China's heroic resistance against Japan from an allied standpoint. Since Japan's surrender, we have provided a great deal of assistance. All military aid given to the Chinese government was not only to help it defeat Japanese aggression but also to help it recover Japanese-occupied territories. The United States provided the majority of the substantial assistance that China received from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. We have also transferred a large amount of surplus materials and equipment of economic value to China at the lowest prices. We are currently continuing to assist China in accordance with the foreign relief program.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Damage Transportation Further Deepening China's Losses</h3>
<p>However, the Chinese government and people are currently suffering from the dual oppression of civil war and rapid economic decline. The difficult situation caused by Japanese occupation and blockade during the eight years of war occurred precisely when construction needed to be undertaken and was further aggravated by internal strife. The continued obstruction and destruction of major transportation routes by communist troops has further deepened the losses already suffered by transportation and production facilities during the war.</p>
<p>The government's increased expenditures due to the civil war far exceed its revenue, further hindering reconstruction efforts. The continuous issuance of currency to cover expenditures has created runaway inflation, disrupting normal commercial activities. In this situation, China's foreign exchange reserves are rapidly decreasing to the point where they are insufficient to pay for essential imports. Without such imports, industrial activity will shrink, and economic decline will worsen.</p>
<p>The United States is deeply concerned about the continued economic decline of China. Since General Marshall's departure from China, the issue of aid to China has been continuously considered. We hope that the environment in China will allow American aid to be used in an effective and constructive manner for construction and reconstruction. The environment we had hoped for has not yet formed, so we can only deal with the situation as best we can under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>We may be able to help alleviate the current economic decline, so that the Chinese government will have another opportunity to begin taking the necessary steps to establish a more stable economic environment. But circumstances have long proven that only the Chinese government itself can take the necessary steps to create an appropriate environment so that efforts for peace and genuine economic recovery can take effect.</p>
<p>To determine the nature and scope of a plan that might be suitable for this purpose, we should pay attention to various different and conflicting factors, including other burdens on our current resources, the availability of certain goods, the scope and complexity of the various problems encountered by the Chinese government, and the extent to which these problems can be resolved with foreign aid. American aid to China, like aid to any other country, must be tailored to its specific needs and capacities.</p>
<h3>Aid to China Plan Should Stipulate Loan or Grant Method Amount Estimated May Be Revised According to Prices</h3>
<p>Based on these factors, I recommend that Congress approve $570 million for an aid to China plan before June 30, 1949.</p>
<p>This plan should stipulate that $510 million be used as funds to pay for the transport of essential imports to China, either as a loan or a grant. This is based on an estimate of prices as of January 1, 1948, as it is currently impossible to predict how price changes will affect this plan. If necessary, revised amount estimates can be submitted when requesting appropriations. The so-called essential imports include food, cotton, oil, fertilizer, tobacco, medicine, coal, and spare parts for existing important equipment. The quantity stipulated in this plan is coordinated with the available supplies. By having the United States pay for these essential imports, the Chinese government can use its limited US dollars to meet the most urgent of its other needs.</p>
<p>The plan should also set aside $60 million for several selected construction projects to be commenced before June 30, 1949, to restore essential transportation, fuel, and power industries, as well as export industries, which are urgently needed. This work can be carried out in areas free from military action and can help improve the supply and distribution of essential goods.</p>
<h3>To Implement Aid Plan China and the US Should Sign an Agreement</h3>
<p>As with the aid for European recovery, the implementation of this aid plan should be governed by an agreement signed by China and the United States, stipulating the conditions and procedures for carrying out this aid. The agreement should include certain guarantees that the Chinese government will take practical economic, financial, and other measures to achieve the goals of economic stability and recovery. If the United States determines that the aid provided is not being handled in accordance with the agreement, or determines that the Chinese government's policies are inconsistent with the purpose of using the aid to help achieve economic self-sufficiency, then the United States should reserve the right to suspend aid.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the agency for handling the European Recovery Program, aid to China should be implemented by the current agency handling the foreign relief program. Legislation approving aid to China should transfer the handling of the aid plan to the agency handling our aid to the European Recovery Program. The handling agency needs the power to adjust the plan at any time, just as it needs the power to adjust the European Recovery Program at any time.</p>
<h3>Give China a Breathing Space Amid Economic Decline</h3>
<p>I believe that the proposed aid to China plan is the best approach that the national government can take in light of all circumstances. No matter what our country gives through aid, it can never replace the necessary actions that only the Chinese government can take. However, this plan can still accomplish an important purpose, which is to give the Chinese government a breathing space amidst economic decline, so that it can find ways to establish a more stable economic situation. Without this breathing space, it is doubtful whether the Chinese government can establish such stability. The realization of this limited objective is of such great significance as to justify the proposed aid plan.</p>
<p>Therefore, I recommend that this plan be given favorable consideration by Congress as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The US is Discussing Aid to China Our Country Should Not Comment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After reading President Truman's address to Congress regarding China on the night of the 18th, government officials announced through Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang: "As the American aid to China bill is still being discussed in Congress, the Chinese government believes it is inappropriate to comment."</p>
<h3>Our Repayment of US Loans</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Chinese Embassy announced today that China has repaid the Export-Import Bank of the United States a 1941 loan of $13,698,000. China has also fulfilled wartime contracts by paying the China Development Finance Corporation with metals worth $3,650,000. The proceeds from the sale will also be paid to the Export-Import Bank. With this repayment completed, the total amount of the 1941 loan of $50 million has been fully repaid. This action demonstrates that the Chinese government, despite its own lack of foreign exchange, is still striving to maintain its credit.</p>
<h3>US Newspaper's Use of "[Reactionary]" Director Dong Corrects It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Director Dong Xian Guang stated at a press conference on the 18th: Recently, American newspapers, when commenting on China, often use the term "reactionary" to refer to the Chinese government. I do not wish to delve deeply into the meaning of the term "reactionary," but I feel that this term has been overused and should be pointed out to correct the situation. (Continued on page two, column one)</p>
<h3>Feng Qin Zai Goes to Ping from Zhang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The newly appointed Parallel Lineage Director Feng Qin Zai arrived in Ping by car from Zhang Xiang at noon on the 18th. After arriving in Ping, Feng will take office as Deputy Director of the Parallel Lineage with ____.</p>
<h3>External Affairs Director Issues Statement South Korea Should Have Free Elections Any Government Built in Violation of the Agreement Will Not Be Considered by Us</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Shi Zhao Ying, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau on the 18th in response to inquiries: The exact situation in North Korea still needs to be clarified. The Chinese government will naturally not consider any government established in Korea in violation of the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the procedures stipulated in the Moscow Agreement. The Chinese government also cannot understand either of the occupying powers being able to ignore the authority of the Moscow Agreement and the United Nations General Assembly and build a government in Korea on its own. The United Nations, in view of the failure of the two occupying countries to cooperate in implementing the provisions of the Moscow Agreement, accepted in the resolutions of the General Assembly the responsibility of assisting the Korean people in realizing their national independence. The acceptance of this responsibility has a solemn and serious meaning, because it is not only related to the happiness of the 20 million Korean people, but also to the safety of the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese government will firmly advocate that the United Nations Korean Commission conduct free elections in any area where elections can be held, to create a government that truly represents the Korean people.

<h3>Anshan National Army Firmly Defends the Urban Area Situation Improves as Shenyang West is Flanked by Land and Air Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Ma Zhanshan Scheduled to Fly to Beijing on the 22nd</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] The battle for Anshan is becoming increasingly fierce. The invading bandits have been concentrating their superior forces and more than 20 artillery pieces to bombard and seize surrounding strongholds. The defending troops held out for several days, and only on the night of the 17th did they make a strategic shift, fully protecting the urban area. Although artillery fire raged in the city, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant workers and citizens, trusting in the bravery of the defending troops, and the air force, which continued to fly back and forth to assist in the battle on the 18th, were quite confident. Anshan was filled with smoke and bullets, becoming a sea of fire. A unit of more than 1,000 men from the 2nd Column of bandits in southern Shenyang fled west from the Sujiatun area, reaching the Erhezi area, ten kilometers west of Shenyang, in the afternoon of the 18th. The National Army repelled them with fierce artillery fire, and the bandits fled in a hurry. The bandits in Masanjia, Laobian, Shalingpu and other places in western Shenyang were largely annihilated by the joint land and air attack of the National Army, and the rest fled. The area has been completely cleared, and the situation is greatly improved.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, and others are scheduled to fly to Beijing on the 22nd. Zhang was originally scheduled to go south on the 19th, and the plane ticket had been arranged by the Tianjin Municipal Government. After arriving in Ping, Wan, Ma, and others invited him to go together, so the trip was postponed. On the evening of the 17th, the three men and fellow villagers from Northeast China had a meeting. Li Zongren hosted a banquet for Zhang, Wan, and Ma at noon on the 18th. This morning, Zhang met with reporters again at his residence in Ping and spoke very cautiously. In response to reporters' questions, he said that he had no opinions on the Northeast issue and that everything would have to wait for the central government to decide. After he arrived in Ping, the fellow villagers from the Northeast had not yet held a formal meeting. In his observation, the situation in northern China was not serious and there was no danger. ____ was mistakenly thought to be Zhang Zuolin's younger brother, but he was actually from Yixian County and was not only not closely related to Zhang Zuolin but was not even from the same hometown. When talking about Zhang Xueshi, he said, "I heard that he is running a school in Jiamusi."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] The work of expanding the area in the Jichang area is being actively promoted. More than 10,000 farmers' anti-bandit armed groups gathered around Changchun have completed their inspections. The garrison troops recently notified the foreign county chiefs to lead their security teams to move into the county territory, waiting for the recovery of local counties and towns.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Liu Zhe, a person from the Northeast living in Beijing, had a meeting with reporters on the 18th regarding the Northeast issue that they were concerned about. According to reports, they had previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang, suggesting four items: (A) immediately send a large army to the pass to reinforce; (B) re-use veterans from the Northeast to organize and train the people; (C) use local arsenals to manufacture ammunition for application; (D) stipulate measures for rewards and punishments for people who defend cities and attack places, such as making the people who defend the city the county magistrate of that county, etc. Now that Zhang Zuoxiang is reportedly coming to Beijing soon, Beijing is also paying close attention to this. After Zhang and others arrive in Beijing, they will hold a meeting with people from the Northeast living in Beijing to discuss the Northeast issue and pay a visit to Chairman Chiang for instructions.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Military Aid to China Kirk Will Offer Opinions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 17th] At General Kirk's farewell press conference, when asked "Whether the United States will give military aid to China" and "Whether it will be able to overcome difficulties without American military aid," Kirk replied: "I have lived in China for 25 months and of course have opinions on this issue, but I can only offer this to the Washington Naval Commander." When Kirk praised Chairman Chiang as a strong and good leader, he was asked, "Is Chiang an ideal leader to lead China through difficulties?" Kirk said: You should ask, who else is there besides him? The real question is, is there anyone else who can take on his current leadership position?</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 18th] Admiral Ramsen, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to fly to Qingdao on the 24th. The purpose of this trip is to inspect various units of the Pacific Fleet. Those traveling with him include Lieutenant General Schneider, Commander of the US Navy Pacific Fleet Air Force, and many staff members. Ramsen and his party will have a five-day stay in China. After inspecting Qingdao, they will visit Beijing and Shanghai. In addition, Lieutenant General Badger, the newly appointed Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, will fly to Qingdao on the 19th and will take office on the USS Estes on the morning of the 24th. General Kirk is scheduled to return to the United States on the USS Whiteside on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] Rear Admiral Malo, Commander of the US 38th Special Combined Fleet, arrived here at 8:00 AM on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Qingdao, 18th] Admiral Kirk, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, revealed on the 18th that a US warship is currently docked near Haiyang, east of the Shandong coast, waiting for personnel from the Chinese Communists to make contact in order to negotiate the release of the four US Marines captured by the Chinese Communists.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement 14th Anniversary Commemoration Chairman Chiang Sends Telegram to Encourage the Nation Raising Three Meanings to Encourage Comrades to Go All Out</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] On the eve of the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to the nation. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the New Life Movement Promotion General Association's provincial and municipal branches and all compatriots across the country: The New Life Movement has been guided to this day for fourteen years. Its purpose is to hone the inherent instincts of self-awareness and self-government of each of our citizens, and to fulfill their patriotic and national salvation duties. Its method of implementation is to extend oneself to others, from the near to the distant, starting with the neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and punctuality of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, so that daily life follows the guidelines of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Everyone should be a self-reliant, self-improving, responsible, and disciplined citizen, so that our China can join the ranks of modern international society as a unified, independent, democratic, and rule-of-law nation. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, our compatriots throughout the country risked dangers, endured hardships, and ultimately defeated the powerful, achieving victory. This relies on the perseverance of our long-standing national spirit and demonstrates the generosity of our national morality, and the New Life Movement has also demonstrated its effectiveness in this regard. Now that the War of Resistance has been won for more than two years, the period of political tutelage has come to an end, and the Constitution has begun to be implemented. I hope that all our compatriots will develop the spirit of democracy and self-government and consistently follow the legal path, so that the Constitution is deeply rooted in the daily lives of the people, and then democratic politics can be improved. The pragmatic implementation and widespread promotion of the New Life Movement is even more important. I would like to tell my compatriots across the country with three meanings.</p>
<p>Firm Self-Confidence</p>
<p>The current concerns of the country and nation lie solely in the rebellion of the Communists, and the most important task of suppressing the Communists is to eliminate the political conspiracies of the Communists. The most dangerous conspiracy of the Communists is to use fierce and evil struggles to create endless hatred among compatriots of all levels, so that reason is lost, morality is destroyed, the foundation of culture is destroyed, and the spirit of the nation disappears, in order to achieve their great desire to divide the territory, destroy sovereignty, and seek glory for the country. All our compatriots must fully understand that today's suppression of bandits and pacification of chaos is actually the key to the nation's survival, honor, and disgrace. It is also the final decisive battle between democratic constitutionalism and violent mobocracy. Everyone must promote their pure reason and firm their national self-confidence, fighting for national salvation and mobilizing for bandit suppression. Only sincerity can overcome deceit, and only justice can defeat tyranny. Throughout history, shameless traitors, rogue bandits, although cunning and deceitful, and committing all kinds of evil deeds, have not failed to be destroyed by our nation's morality and the spirit of the country. The presence of good and evil is the basis for judging victory or defeat. Everyone works together to achieve success. This is the first.</p>
<p>Raise Awareness</p>
<p>Warfare and constitutionalism are two sides of the same nation-building effort. Pacifying the chaos is to remove the obstacles to constitutionalism, and constitutionalism is to establish the framework for democracy. All our soldiers and civilians must be united in front to save the suffering compatriots, and be responsible for maintaining social order in the rear. Today, the Communists destroy the law and disrupt order in the villages they control, clearing out their dissidents through cruel struggles, so that the people have no choice but to be forced to participate in the war. In the cities in our rear, they lay in ambush spies and organize their so-called city work departments, attempting to disrupt the security of various places. Therefore, any collective action in schools and factories is prone to deterioration and become the baseline for conspiracy and riots. All patriotic compatriots should raise awareness, encourage each other, abide by discipline, and take responsibility, so as to limit the activities of the Communists and protect public safety. This is the second.</p>
<p>Diligence, Thrift, and Economy</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation said: "Spirit is better than matter, and revolution must first revolutionize the heart." Today's economic problems are more manipulated by humans than they are by natural factors, and psychological panic is more than objective facts. I hope that our compatriots will understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, discern gains and losses, and examine public and private matters. They should use diligence to increase production, use frugality to save waste of materials, do not speculate to fuel the mischief of floating capital, do not hoard to stimulate the soaring of prices, guide businesses to normal tracks, and control profits to reasonable limits, so that the nation's economic and social policies can be thoroughly implemented. Then the economic crisis will be overcome, and the foundation for suppressing chaos and building the nation will also be laid. This is the third.</p>
<p>In short, the country today has moved into the constitutional era, and survival, honor, and disgrace depend on the degree of national self-awareness and the ability to self-govern. All our compatriots must have firm confidence, maintain a well-ordered life, recognize righteousness and benefit, distinguish right from wrong, cultivate the people's love of things, and take on the responsibility of saving the country and building the nation. It is deeply believed that national unification, the success of constitutionalism, the elimination of armed rebellion, and the overcoming of the economic crisis all depend on this. I hope that my compatriots will encourage each other and strive diligently and bravely to achieve it. February 18, 37th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek.</p>

<h3>French Troops Attack Yunnan Border, We Have Lodged a Protest</h3>
<p>Retaining the Right to Compensation for Losses</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Since July of the 35th year (1946), French military aircraft have twice intruded into Guangxi's Pingxiang border, once flying over the mountain pass, once circling over Nanguan, once flying into Jingxi, three times intruding into Hekou, and once strafing at Shuikou. After receiving reports, the Ministry has repeatedly protested to the French side, requesting that the French-Vietnamese authorities stop it. The French side replied: the airspace where French aircraft entered was adjacent to the borders of Vietnam-Yunnan or Vietnam-Guangxi, and French flight personnel made slight oversights, resulting in crossing the border. The French side expressed deep regret for this and ordered French military aircraft to pay close attention and not intrude into our country's airspace again. As for the report that French aircraft recently dropped bombs on the Guangxi border, the Ministry, based on Song's report, has telegraphed the special commissioners stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi to investigate the truth and report.</p>
<h3>Grain Rationing Set to Begin Next Month, Contingent Upon Adequate Preparation, Zoned Discussions Held at Distribution Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Five Cities Grain Rationing Conference continued its zoned discussions on the 18th. The Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) zone was discussed in the morning and the Jin-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) zone in the afternoon, both personally presided over by Yu Feipeng. In the meeting, each unit first reported on the actual situation in various places based on the implementation rules passed yesterday. The issue of grain sources was also repeatedly raised for discussion, with the hope that the central government would provide more assistance to the Pingjin area in terms of grain sources. Furthermore, issues such as transportation, storage, and the profits of distributors have not yet been finalized in today's meeting and will be discussed again at a meeting on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Five Cities Grain Rationing Conference has concluded. Wu Kaixian of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has left Beijing and returned to Shanghai. Representatives from Pingjin and Guangzhou respectively discussed the special issues of their cities individually with Minister Yu Feipeng on the morning and afternoon of the 18th. The various proposals from yesterday's meeting will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for final discussion and then announced for implementation. The Five Cities Grain Rationing Implementation Rules passed yesterday stipulate that cooperatives be established in various places, and their prices will be reasonably determined by the respective municipal governments according to local conditions, but cannot be lower than a certain standard for grain prices. In order to ensure fairness in the amount of rations distributed, the amount will be uniform across regions. Although Shanghai proposed rationing two dou per person per month, more than the other four cities, this proposal was not finalized by the Ministry of Food. Except for Pingjin, where wheat-based food is the staple, the three cities of Jin, Hu, and Sui will primarily rely on rice, but the conversion ratio between flour and rice will be the same, with one municipal dou converting to fifteen municipal jin of flour. This grain rationing is only a trial run using the more than 170,000 tons of American relief grain. To coordinate with the supply of American relief grain, the trial run is temporarily set for four months. Whether the five cities will continue to implement it in the future or extend it to the whole country will depend on the supply of grain and the results of the implementation. The opening date is set for March 1, but those whose rationing work is not prepared in time will be determined with reference to the actual situation at that time.</p>
<h3>KMT Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, Reorganization Approved by Central Standing Committee, Wang Chonghui Reports on the Issue of National Assembly Delegate Concessions</h3>

Regarding the issue of National Assembly delegate election concessions, the Central Committee had requested Wang Chonghui to study the relevant central election laws. Wang presented a detailed report at today's Standing Committee meeting, which was discussed, but no results were reached. It was decided to hand it over to the election working group for further study. It was also learned that Comrade Xie Yongcun, the new secretary of the provincial party headquarters, died in a plane crash on official duty. The Central Committee has recently decided to issue funeral and relief funds to provide condolences.</p>

<h3>Nanjing, Hankou, and Other Inland River Ports, Our Government Considers Opening, But Not as a Condition of Accepting Foreign Aid</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Reliable source: Our government is currently considering the conditional opening of Nanjing, Hankou, and other inland river ports along the Yangtze River to facilitate foreign ships carrying American relief supplies, especially grain supplied for distribution in various places, to directly unload them at these ports for use, so as to avoid the consumption and delays of transshipment. This conditional opening will limit the location and date of berthing and unloading cargo through a licensing system. When returning along the river, they will accept our commission to load tung oil, tungsten sand, antimony ore, porcelain, and other handicraft products for export, so as to meet the actual needs of export trade. Authoritative sources claimed: the government's plan to take this step is definitely not a condition of accepting foreign aid, and all control powers will remain in our hands, and it will not involve the basic national policy of maintaining inland river navigation rights.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, replied to reporters' inquiries at a press conference on the 18th:</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that the US government requires obtaining navigation rights for American ships on the Yangtze River as a condition for assisting China. What is the definition of inland river navigation rights?</p>
<p>Answer: The rumor that the US government requires inland river navigation rights as a condition for assisting China is completely untrue. No other country has made such a request. Since the conclusion of the Equal New Treaty and the abolition of foreign privileges in China, China's policy on navigation rights is no different from the general practices of other countries. Dong also pointed out three points: (1) Inland river navigation rights refer to the right of ships to carry goods from port A in China to port B in China. This right is limited to domestic merchants. (2) Foreign ships carrying goods from foreign ports to China, and carrying goods from Chinese ports to foreign countries, may unload and load cargo at ports in China that the government has announced open. (3) The Chinese government has the freedom to open or close any coastal or inland river port when necessary for foreign ships loading export goods or unloading import goods. This step must be carefully considered after considering the needs of the country, especially the actual needs of export trade. The implementation of this step will not affect the basic policy of maintaining inland river rights. (Continued on page two, column one)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-Baptized in a New Life! — 14th Anniversary of the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the New Life Movement. On this day fourteen years ago, when Chairman Chiang was stationed in Nanchang, he advocated the New Life Movement to revitalize the national spirit. The initial purpose of the New Life Movement was not only to equip the general public with national morality and national knowledge, but also to enable them to get rid of the old and embrace the new, and live a new life that conforms to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor." Only three years after the New Life Movement was advocated, the nationwide War of Resistance against Japan broke out. In just three or four years, it was of course not an easy task to thoroughly reform the people of the whole country, whether in consciousness, action, or life, and it can almost be said to be an impossible task in the context of accumulated problems. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, after the central government moved to Chongqing, National Monthly Meetings were held in the rear cities every month. Although nominally it was the National Spiritual Mobilization, in reality it was to constantly awaken the general officials and people to practice the essence of the New Life Movement, so that both public and private life could be thoroughly reformed. No one can deny that the New Life Movement made a great contribution to the victory of the War of Resistance, but this contribution was a spiritual and moral force, unlike material forces that can be estimated with numbers.</p>
<p>Recently, contemporary people have discussed modern international wars, saying that they are "scientific wars," and that the victory or defeat of a war depends entirely on material forces. And we, although not absolute idealists, believing that human beings can rely on their courage to fight bombs and artillery with flesh and blood, always feel that no matter how advanced science is and how strong material forces are, they still have to rely on spiritual forces to use them. Taking our country's War of Resistance as an example, from the September 18th Incident to the outbreak of the all-out War of Resistance, the material strength of the Japanese militarists can be said to have reached its peak, far beyond what our country could compare with. If our country had relied solely on material strength to compete with Japan, it would have been like heaven and earth, but we resolutely disregarded the material disadvantage and launched an all-out War of Resistance against Japan, not only enduring for eight years but also achieving the final victory. What force supported this War of Resistance, which disregarded success or failure and risked life and death? Obviously, it was the spiritual power of our nation! Chairman Chiang said last year today: "Looking back at the eight years of the War of Resistance, we went through all kinds of difficulties, and finally relied on the revitalization of the whole people to achieve victory, which shows that the spirit of our nation has an indelible brilliance." The source of this spiritual power is the "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor" advocated by the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>However, looking at the current situation, whether it is the people's lives or the social atmosphere, it makes us infinitely sigh when we think of the goals revealed by the New Life Movement. We really dare to say a word that explores the root of the problem: the reason why China's disasters have occurred today, as well as the hidden dangers of the future country and nation, is because the general public cannot adhere to the New Life Movement creed, that is, the majority of people have long put propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor on the shelf. Broadly speaking, since the victory, the communists have launched a full-scale rebellion, on the one hand obeying foreign races and splitting China, and on the other hand instigating heresy and destroying culture. Mencius said: "Heretical doctrines and violent actions arise," which is a portrayal of the communists at this time. The purpose of the communists is not only to make our country lose the once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity to build a country, to make the general public feel threatened by life and livelihood, but also to try to bewitch the ignorant youth, destroy the inherent morality of our nation, and try to fundamentally overthrow our country's ethical concepts. Although the New Life Movement has gone through fourteen years of advocacy and practice, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor are seen by the communists as outdated, corrupt, stubborn, and old-fashioned, as if they must be kicked clean and swept away before they are happy. They force sons to kill their fathers and brothers to kill their brothers, so what are they talking about propriety? They sacrifice the people and betray the motherland, so what are they talking about righteousness? They use struggle and liquidation as a pretext, but in reality, they are looting, so what are they talking about integrity? They call it freedom of sexual intercourse and allocate women, so what are they talking about honor? As long as the communists exist for one day, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor will be "humiliated" for one day. Guan Zhong said: "If the four dimensions are not expanded, the country will perish." The communists want to use this method to make China perish at the hands of the ethnic masters worshiped by the communists!</p>
<p>Looking back at our recent social atmosphere, it is so decadent and rotten that it really needs the strength of thunder to make the entire society re-baptized by the New Life. The country is in such danger, and the soldiers are so arduous, but how extravagant and absurd is the life of the Shanghai citizens - especially the higher citizens? During the Spring Festival holidays, they gambled and drank, happily and cheerfully, throwing away tens of millions as usual, even a big bet, the winnings and losses amounted to billions. It is not necessary to mention other extravagant and lewd situations. God! Why don't they think about the soldiers shedding their blood on the cold battlefield? Why don't they think again about the refugees crying and begging for food and warmth on the streets are also compatriots? Why don't they think more about the countless aspiring youths from poor families who are worried about not being able to pay the high tuition fees and are about to drop out of school? These walking corpses who enjoy luxurious lives, no longer have the slightest concept of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. They have forgotten the society and the country, they only know the individual, and only know selfishness. The rampant nature of the communists is of course driven by their violence, but these corrupt social atmospheres are also a contributing factor. And the general officialdom, only talk about perfunctoriness, do not take responsibility, protect each other, do not pay attention to discipline, if this corrupt and incompetent political style is not thoroughly reformed, then China's political future will be very bleak. General Fu Zuoyi said: Suppressing the bandits must be combined with politics, economy, culture, etc., and military affairs can be completed. That's right, we believe that what needs to be coordinated most is the rectification of the atmosphere, and the clarification of officialdom, and to achieve these two points, we must use great strength to promote the New Life Movement and practice a life of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor.</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang Answers Reporters' Questions (Continued from page one)</h3>
<p>Question: Where does the government currently obtain its supply of weapons and ammunition?</p>
<p>Answer: Some were purchased from abroad, and some were manufactured by China itself.</p>
<p>Question: When will Bei Zuyi return to China?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not heard anything about it.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the reform of the currency system, people from all walks of life have recently discussed it. What is the attitude of the relevant authorities of our government towards this issue of national concern? And what discussions did Bei Zuyi have on this matter in the United States?</p>
<p>Answer: Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan attended a meeting of the Legislative Yuan on February 5 and mentioned the issue of currency reform when reporting on the general budget bill, saying that currency reform has been favored by public opinion, and the government's position is also the same, but because (1) the country is mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, and the expenditures are huge, (2) the communists are destroying transportation and destroying the economy, resulting in shrinking production and stagnant transportation, and the supply and demand in some places are not corresponding, and prices are not easy to stabilize, (3) affected by the communist disaster, people are displaced and their ability to bear the burden is reduced, therefore, stabilizing the currency value and stabilizing prices are equally important before or after the currency reform, but preparing for currency reform must first establish a foundation that gradually stabilizes the currency value. I have no other comments to offer.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Misuse [Reactionary]</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) In general, the term "reactionary" is often used arbitrarily without understanding its true meaning. The term "reactionary" is translated from the English word "Reactionary." If we consult Webster's Dictionary, we will know that the original meaning of this word is "to favor the restoration of the old order," and its interpretation of "reactionary elements" is "those who intend to obstruct political progress." We ask American writers when they refer to our government as "reactionary," can they point out anyone in our government who meets the above definition? The question itself is sufficient to show the absurdity and unreasonableness of their misuse of nouns.</p>
<p>The important figures in our government are all far-sighted and possess liberal ideas. They can be regarded as representatives of China's most progressive elements. They work day and night to promote the progress of the country and have never "obstructed" its progress. In terms of liberal views and contemporary thought, they can be compared with the enlightened political leaders of Western democratic countries without shame. Of course, such people are all pragmatic and realistic people, and extreme elements or communists have no possibility of being mixed among them. They are now working hard to eradicate various malpractices and backward phenomena, and within the scope permitted by the political and economic situation, they are leading the Chinese people to move forward bravely to establish a progressive and modern government. When necessary, they will carry out reforms forcefully, regardless of difficulties. I can assure the doubters that we are now on the road to practical and lasting progress.</p>
<p>The Chinese government welcomes the participation of any truly liberal elements, but hopes that they can work together within the scope stipulated by the new democratic constitution. Is it too much to ask? In fact, many well-known liberals have been working within the government to effectively implement the constitution. Therefore, the so-called reactionary nature of our government is, in its essence, only communist propaganda. I feel deeply that if we can announce a moral standard to limit the use of this term, it will definitely promote a true understanding of international affairs.</p>
<p>The term "reactionary" has almost become a common title used by political enemies. There is also the same misuse in American politics. As far as I know, in the past few decades, in every presidential election campaign, opposing parties or presidential candidates have inevitably ridiculed each other with "reactionary" or "reactionary elements." However, mutual accusations cannot make either party truly become reactionary, because the political application of this term has lost its true meaning.</p>
<p>The misuse of this term by some American editors when writing editorials has caused great harm to China. It is easy for those who do not know the truth to misunderstand China, thinking that China's democratic and reactionary forces are clearly divided and tend to extremes, but the actual situation is not like this. China, like other countries, also has people with more backward thinking, but they have not participated in the government, and the so-called democrats usually referred to by some editors are known to the Chinese people as puppets used by totalitarian communism. Our country sincerely welcomes the genuine criticism of overseas friends. They point out our true shortcomings, provide objective standards, and help us measure the merits and demerits of national policies, which is a great contribution to us. However, if we only engage in slander, it will not be beneficial to both China and the United States.</p>
<h3>My Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Zhou Qianchong Returns to China from the United States, Talks About American Preventive Measures to Avoid Economic Panic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Zhou Qianchong, advisor to my delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, has returned to China from the United States. According to him, although the future of the United Nations is not very bright, he believes that there is no need to be pessimistic. Regarding whether an economic panic in the United States can be avoided, he said that no country can solve all problems behind closed doors. The US government has foreseen the trend of its economic instability, so it has taken various preventive measures, such as restoring price controls and tightening credit loans. I believe that the main purpose of the Marshall Plan is also to avoid domestic recession, because only when all countries are prosperous can the United States maintain its prosperity. Economic panic is by no means beyond human power to save, but if the assistance provided to various countries by the Marshall Plan is too little or too late, it will have a bad impact on the American economy. He said that the United States' plan to provide large-scale assistance to China in various aspects may be decided. When I was in Washington, General Marshall told me that "there will be no major difficulties in Congress passing the aid to China bill, but under a democratic system, everything cannot be demanded too quickly." According to my observation, the United States hopes that aid to China can achieve 100% effectiveness, so we ourselves must strive to implement reforms. Zhou will go to Beijing tonight to report to the government on the experience of attending the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Aluminum Corporation, Content of the Sino-American Cooperation Draft, Capital Equally Shared by Both Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] After the draft cooperation agreement between the American Reynolds Aluminum Company and my National Resources Commission for the joint operation of the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation was signed, it is now awaiting approval from the higher-level institutions of both parties and can be signed and implemented. The reporter recently learned the content of the draft agreement, and its main points are as follows: A. In principle, both parties adopt equal cooperation. The capital of the aluminum company is 50% each by the National Resources Commission and the American Reynolds Company. During the negotiations, I once advocated that the ratio of funds between the two parties should be 51 to 49, but the result was still in accordance with the principle of equal cooperation, each being 50%. B. The organization name is still Taiwan Aluminum Corporation, with the board of directors as the highest authority. There are seven directors, of which China and the United States each account for three, and the other person is appointed by both parties through consultation when necessary. C. Economic cooperation. The total amount of the company's share capital is 17 million US dollars, divided into two types: 1. Common share capital of 1 million US dollars, half each for China and the United States. 2. Preferred share capital of 16 million US dollars, half each for China and the United States. Of this share capital, the 8.5 million US dollars invested by Reynolds Company will be used to purchase equipment. The 8.5 million US dollars of my National Resources Commission will be valued with equipment and machinery. At the same time, in order to effectively implement economic cooperation, the draft agreement also stipulates that both parties can jointly borrow from the US Import-Export Bank when necessary. D. Technical cooperation. Reynolds Company can send technical personnel to China to participate in the work of the company. E. After the start of cooperation between the two parties, the company will set up an aluminum rolling factory to engage in aluminum rolling. In the future development of the aluminum industry, it will focus on daily necessities for people's livelihood.</p>

At the same time, the store was equipped with a telephone, and there were many foreign customers. When the inspectors were inspecting, there were incoming calls inquiring about gold prices, which proved that the store was obviously engaged in illegal gold trading. Finally, several taels of broken gold were found in the room. The Financial Management Bureau has sent all relevant criminals to the police station for further interrogation, and the seized gold is temporarily kept by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Student Public Funding Treatment Issues: Education Ministry Director He's Remarks: Universal Full Public Funding Impossible</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the issue of student public funding, Director He Shijun of the Ministry of Education recently stated: "Student public funding treatment is a very large burden on the government. Currently, there are still those who demand universal full public funding, which is not only financially impossible for the government to permit, but is also unreasonable.</p>
<p>Evolution of Publicly Funded Students</p>
<p>According to today's public funding and scholarships, they originated from wartime loans, initially in very small amounts, with funds being evenly distributed by each school itself. In the autumn of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940], the funds began to be allocated by the government. In the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943], it was renamed public funding. However, it was consistently stipulated that it would last until the end of the War of Resistance or the student's graduation. In May of last year, the Fourth Session of the Third National Political Consultative Conference believed that the public funding system was originally a wartime system, and if it remained unchanged, it would easily foster a dependency mentality among students. Therefore, it was resolved that students already enjoying public funding could continue to receive it until graduation. After that, new students should be granted scholarships based on their academic performance and family circumstances, so that outstanding and promising young people could pursue further studies. On the other hand, the government could transfer the current huge amount of public funding to be used for school teaching equipment. The government has followed this resolution of the National Political Consultative Conference. Since the last semester, it has been stipulated that 20% of newly admitted students will be given scholarships. Those who were originally approved for public funding will continue to receive it. Among the new students, normal school students, Bao Qing students, veteran students from youth military service, border students, children of revolutionary and anti-Japanese war heroes, and honorably discharged soldiers attending school will all receive public funding uniformly, without being subject to quota restrictions. After last autumn, due to the expansion of the pacification zones and the large number of students from bandit-controlled areas, it was further stipulated that students from national and provincial colleges and universities whose household registration belonged to bandit-controlled areas and who were approved for relief would be exempted from tuition and accommodation fees, and provided with meals according to the eight-expense student meal standard. The government's care for students can be said to be meticulous.</p>
<p>Heavy Burden on the Government</p>
<p>Currently, there are 76,978 fully publicly funded students and 12,181 half publicly funded students in colleges and universities nationwide. There are 44,471 fully publicly funded students and 12,765 half publicly funded students in secondary schools, totaling over 121,400 fully publicly funded students and over 24,900 half publicly funded students, not including provincial-level publicly funded students. The treatment of publicly funded students includes a main food allowance of 2 shi and 3 sheng of rice per student per month, or 46 jin of flour. In addition to the allocation areas where a substitute allowance is issued at the allocated price, the remainder is issued at the market price, and a supplementary allowance is issued based on one-thirty-seventh of the living base for public school personnel, multiplied by the living index. According to this standard, the monthly public funding for each student in the Northeast schools has reached more than 3 million yuan, and in the Beijing-Shanghai area, due to the allocation relationship, it is more than 400,000 yuan per student per month. The budget for the first half of this year includes over 430 billion yuan for student meal expenses, accounting for 15% of the educational funds managed by the ministry, but in fact, it is far from enough. Including the additional funds that have not yet been approved, the amount needed for the first half of this year is about 730 billion yuan, accounting for about 25% of the educational funds managed by the ministry. Currently, there are widespread rumors that some people are promoting universal full public funding treatment, which will inevitably make the funding for school teaching equipment even more scarce. This is not the right way to run education. Moreover, due to financial difficulties in primary education in our country, there are many out-of-school children. The government spends a lot of money to provide meal expenses for students in secondary and higher schools, which is purely out of concern for maintaining education. If the quota is further increased and public funding is made universal, it would not only be contrary to reason and sentiment, but no country in the world has such a precedent."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] Over 12,000 male and female citizens of Taiyuan have gathered in 29 schools since yesterday to begin a half-month long "Three Self-Training" (i.e., self-purification, self-defense, self-government). Director Yan Xishan, in his opening speech, instructed the people that only after self-purification can they defend themselves, and only after self-defense can they govern themselves. Therefore, self-purification is a necessary path to self-government. The purpose of self-purification work is to mobilize the people, eliminate disguised elements (i.e., communist bandits lurking within), strengthen the bandit suppression camp, and complete the great cause of national reconstruction after the chaos. The citizens receiving training were selected based on the principles of "three courtyards, one male hero" and "five courtyards, one female leader." The "Three Self-Training Committee," the organization in charge of the training, is headed by Yang Aiyuan, deputy director of the Pacification Headquarters, and Liang Dunhou, a member of the provincial government, as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. The mayor of Taiyuan, Bai Zhiyi, serves as the director of the office. According to reports, this work has been completed in the counties of Jinzhong, and the results are very significant.</p>

<h3>The Wars in North and Central China are Relatively Quiet, The Focus of the War is in the Northeast, The Ministry of National Defense Releases a Week of War Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 18th of this newspaper] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense recently released the week's war situation from February 11th to 17th as follows:</p>
<p>Northeast: The battles in various battlefields have been more intense in Guandong [Northeast China] recently, while those in North and Central China have been relatively quiet. The focus of the war is in the Northeast, so all parties are concerned about the situation in the Northeast. In the past week, the National Army in Liaobei launched a mopping-up operation north of Shifosi. The Lin bandit's [Lin Biao] 13th, 10th, and 2nd Columns, a part of the 1st Column, and the Independent 4th Division, totaling about 50,000 bandits, gathered and attempted to make trouble. They were attacked. Due to the cunning of the bandits, who refused to engage in decisive battles with the National Army, the 3rd and 10th Columns turned southwest to Shifosi, attempting to cut off the Shenyang-Xinmin line. In the Liaoxi area, the bandits saw that the National Army's large corps had arrived in Jinzhou, and the plan to cut off the Beining Road was faltering. Only the 9th Column and a part of the 8th Column were left to contain the National Army's forces. The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 7th Columns, totaling about 100,000 bandits, were transferred east to the vicinity of Liaozhong and Shenyang South. After taking the opportunity to capture Liaoyang, they have been besieging Anshan with about 60,000 bandits from the 4th, 6th, and 8th Columns, isolating Yingkou, and attempting to cut off the transportation line from the southern section of Shenyang directly to the sea. In the battle of Liaoyang, the National Army transferred its position after exhausting 10,000 of the bandit army's main forces. The defense battle of Anshan is now unfolding.</p>
<p>North China: After Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops in North China suffered a crushing defeat from the National Army in the outer suburbs of Baoding and near Laishui in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway, they have tried their best to avoid battle and recuperate for several weeks. However, they have not yet recovered their vitality. The National Army has gradually completed the deployment of the suppression operation here and is studying political bandit suppression strategies. In the past week, in addition to the very smooth mopping-up operation in northern Hebei and Chahar, the battles in other places have been relatively quiet.</p>
<p>East China: Chen Yi's [Communist commander] troops in East China have no place to survive in eastern Henan, and the main force was forced to flee back to western Shandong. His 1st, 4th, 6th, 8th, Liangguang Columns, and the cadres of his 3rd Column, totaling about 60,000, originally planned to recuperate, but under the continuous pursuit and suppression by the National Army's elite troops, they have not had a moment's rest. Currently, most of his forces have fled to the narrow area east of Heze, and between Dingtao, Chengwu, and Cao County. The 10th and 11th Columns, which were originally left between Cao County and Chengwu, are currently being attacked by the National Army, which has advanced fiercely from Cao County in the east and Shan County in the south, and they cannot advance or retreat.</p>
<p>Central China: The situation of Liu Bocheng's [Communist commander] bandit troops in Central China has recently become quite alarming due to the retreat of Chen Yi's main force to western Shandong. 80% of the vast area of the Dabie Mountains is controlled by the National Army, and all important strongholds are owned by the National Army. At the moment Liu's bandits, with the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns, totaling about 50,000 men, are active in a few mountainous areas of the Dabie Mountains, with no source of soldiers, no food to eat, no strength to fight, and a severe shortage of ammunition. Last month, Liu himself led the 2nd Column in a desperate attempt to flee north, hoping to open a supply line and receive some supplies sent by Chen Yi. The National Army dealt a head-on blow on the north bank of the Huai River, forcing them to flee back hastily, and they were continuously attacked along the way back. In the battle of Xindian (near Fu), on the 14th of this month, the 6th Brigade of the bandits was defeated. The 3rd Column originally planned to attack Yuexi while Liu's bandits fled north, restraining the National Army's forces and supporting Liu's bandits. As a result, not only did it fail to exert any restraining effect, but it suffered losses in the battle to lift the siege of Yuexi on the 6th of this month and in the battle of Shuihouling (southwest of Yuexi) on the 13th. It is currently still dividing into smaller units, lurking in the mountainous areas southeast, west, and east of Yuexi. In short, the Dabie Mountains war situation, which has attracted national attention, has in fact entered a stage of joint suppression by the military and civilians. Other bandits in the Jinshan area, the Yuxi area, and the Dahongshan area have had small contacts, but there have been no significant battles.</p>

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Officially Votes to Pass the European Aid Bill with Amendments Stipulating that Recipient Countries Should Balance Their Budgets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee officially voted today to unanimously pass the European Recovery Program legislation drafted by the committee, naming it the "Economic Cooperation Act of 1948," which stipulates the launch of a 5.3 billion yuan aid plan for 16 European countries for the twelve months beginning April 1st. The Senate will begin debating the bill on March 1st. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg announced that the European Aid Program has been included in the final amendment by the Foreign Relations Committee, stipulating that each recipient country should balance its government budget as soon as possible according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee officially passed a bill today approving a four-year European Recovery Program and an initial appropriation of $5.3 billion for the first year. However, the committee stipulated that $3 billion of the initial appropriation should be allocated from the fiscal surplus of this fiscal year. Republican senators, eager to have sufficient government fiscal surplus for the purpose of reducing income taxes for the next fiscal year, passed the above provisions, so that the $3 billion line of credit will be paid from this year's government tax revenue, otherwise, if paid under the next fiscal year, this fund will be blamed. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Millikin, who presided over the above amendment, said that the government's proposed $9 billion foreign aid plan is too burdensome on the next year's finances. The action taken by the committee today makes it more likely that Congress will pass the European Recovery Program and the Republican proposal to cut taxes by $4.5 billion to $6.5 billion. At the same time, the Republican move to cut numbers is a political action to show the savings in next year's budget and reduce the tax burden on voters.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said today that he would also agree to cut European aid if it was the only way to get the European aid bill through Congress. Eaton said, "I still support a long-term aid plan, but I will also support it if it is necessary to reduce the amount and duration in order to pass the bill. Eaton also revealed that the House Foreign Affairs Committee could complete public hearings by the end of next week, and then begin drafting its legislation. It will not be completed before the Senate begins debating on March 1. It is generally expected that the amount that the House Foreign Affairs Committee will pass will be less than the $5.3 billion approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."</p>
<h3>Small General Assembly to Meet Next Thursday, Korean Issue on Agenda, US State Department Temporarily Remains Silent</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 17th] When the United Nations Small General Assembly meets next Thursday, the Korean issue will be on the agenda. The United Nations Korean Committee has one special report, which is expected to arrive on Thursday. The Small General Assembly will review the issues of the Soviet Union and Ukraine's refusal to participate in the Korean Committee, as well as the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with it in Korea.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The State Department has refused to comment on reports that the People's Republic of North Korea has been established until the situation there is clarified. At the same time, Jebkko, the political adviser to General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, has come here from South Korea to review the new situation in Korea with Secretary of State Marshall. Authoritative sources revealed that the news in the newspapers about the recent developments in North Korea is slightly different from the intelligence obtained by the State Department. Therefore, the US government will not take any action until the investigation is clear.</p>
<h3>New York Times Editorial Criticizes the Situation in North Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] The New York Times editorial on the 18th criticized the Korean situation, saying: "Korea is only a part of the whole picture. The United States and the United Nations are facing a long-term Soviet policy, and the stakes in this policy are higher than ideas and the Korean cabinet. The stake is the Northeast. The Northeast is currently threatened by the Soviet side on its northwest. If the Soviet Union controls Korea, the southern part of the Northeast will also be threatened. This move can be carried out by the Chinese Communist organization under Soviet command. The Northeast can become an 'independent socialist Soviet Manchurian Republic' in the short term. Korea is just a stop in progress. The United Nations Small General Assembly has encountered some cold political facts. The Northeast is extremely valuable to the Soviet Union. Once Korea is controlled, the Northeast can be taken easily. The Northeast is also extremely important to China. If China strives to recover from the war ruins, all actions of the United Nations should be viewed in this light."</p>
<h3>US Military Officer Mocked, Hodge Protests</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 18th] According to an official announcement here, two US military officers were mocked by Koreans during a review of the North Korean army in the Soviet-occupied area. General Hodge, commander of the US military in Korea, has lodged a strong protest. Hodge's protest was made to Major General Kolotkov, commander of the Soviet 25th Army. The content will not be released until the protest reaches Pyongyang.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Greece Special Military Expenditure Will Exceed 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th, United Press] If the US Congress passes the current aid to Greece plan, its post-war stake in Greece will exceed one billion US dollars. US aid to Greece includes $300 million in loans under the Truman Doctrine, totaling $767.7 million. It is estimated that Greece can receive $186 million in the first 15 months under the Marshall Plan. The US government will soon ask Congress to allocate more than 100 million US dollars in special military expenditure for aid to Greece.</p>
<h3>Iran Buys Weapons from the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 17th] After a fierce debate today, the Iranian Parliament has approved the purchase of $10 million worth of weapons and military equipment from the United States, with the price to be paid in installments over 12 years.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Visits Lovett to Discuss West German Issues</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 17th] French Ambassador Bonnet met with Deputy Secretary of State Lovett today to discuss the issues related to western Germany, which will be proposed for discussion in London next Monday. Bonnet told reporters that he would emphasize that France is seeking a major step towards the internationalization of the Ruhr area and is particularly focused on the "steel industry," and that France favors a "genuine federal organization of Germany."</p>
<p>As for whether the Benelux three countries should participate in the London conference, Bonnet said that France supports their participation. He expressed his confidence that a method can be found in the future to enable the three countries to express their opinions.</p>
<h3>Polish Representative to the Social and Economic Council Discusses the European Aid Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] Polish representative Lanzki said at the United Nations Economic and Social Council that the Marshall Plan will fail in Western Europe for two reasons: (1) The industrial products and surplus exports of Western Europe, especially Germany, will have no way out if they do not include Eastern Europe as consumers. (2) Western European countries compete with each other in industry and cannot turn to each other for help. Lanzki argued that it is almost impossible to revive a part of Europe while discriminating against other parts. The economic division of Europe is the result of political considerations. The focus on economic assistance to Western Europe in order to establish a new balance of power in European politics is contrary to economic logic, is costly, and is bound to fail.</p>
<h3>End of the Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference in Eastern Europe; Joint Declaration to Be Issued; Allegedly Aimed at Enhancing Collective Security</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 17th] The Foreign Ministers' Conference of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia will conclude tomorrow morning. President Beneš is scheduled to meet with the Polish and Yugoslav Foreign Ministers tomorrow afternoon, and a joint statement is expected to be released that evening. The Polish and Yugoslav delegations are scheduled to depart for their respective countries at midnight tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 17th] The Foreign Ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia held a meeting here today to discuss the German issue. Based on the general impression of the three Foreign Ministers' speeches today, the meeting does not seem to intend to break away from the Western powers and make a final decision, but rather to issue a solemn warning, calling on the powers to strengthen cooperation on this serious European issue. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simić criticized the Western powers' policy towards Germany with sharp language, while Polish Foreign Minister Modzelewski adopted a more moderate attitude, explaining that the purpose of the Prague Conference is to enhance collective security and that peace is an indivisible whole, which is the foundation of the United Nations. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk stated that we should not give up hope that the powers will eventually reach an agreement on the German issue. Prague diplomatic circles doubt whether this can be achieved, as the hopes of Czech politicians may not be consistent with the actual actions of the powers. On the other hand, it is also said that the "Cold War" between Eastern and Western powers is allowing Germany to reap the benefits, which not only endangers peace and security in Europe but will also affect the entire world.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 17th] A Czech foreign affairs spokesperson stated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland, which opened in Prague on the 17th, is not directed against any Western power. There is no intention to discuss any territorial issues at the meeting, and the aim is only to draw attention to the needs and concerns of Germany's neighbors. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Poland are deeply concerned that unilateral decisions will reduce opportunities for economic improvement, thereby increasing the possibility of German unrest. The Slavic countries believe that peace in Central Europe can only be ensured through cooperation among small neighboring countries. The three countries will issue a joint statement expressing dissatisfaction with the ineffectiveness of disarming Germany and reducing war industries and will demand that the peace treaty with Germany include a provision prohibiting propaganda offensives against neighboring countries.</p>
<h3>Upset Election in the Bronx, New York</h3>

<p>[United Press, London, 17th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps announced in the House of Commons today that MacArthur's headquarters has approved the allocation of 30% of Japanese industrial assets as reparations, one-sixth of which has been allocated to the United Kingdom so that the first batch of machinery can be shipped to Burma and British territories in the Far East in the short term.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The House of Representatives meeting to decide on the nomination of the Japanese Prime Minister is likely to be delayed until next week, given the current situation.

<h3>Allied Council for Japan Refuses to Discuss Japanese Internal Affairs; Soviet Representative's Proposal Fails</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Allied Council for Japan held its 52nd meeting today.

The U.S. representative replied: "According to MacArthur's instructions, this matter is an internal political issue of Japan and should be resolved by the Japanese themselves. There is no need for this Council to discuss it." However, the Soviet representative stated that he reserved the right to re-propose the motion for discussion. The 52nd meeting ended unhappily.</p>

<h3>Life Exists on Mars; Ice Caps at the Poles</h3>
<p>[United Press, McDonald Observatory, Texas, 18th] Astronomers at the McKeech astronomers claim that recent studies of Mars have provided preliminary evidence that primitive life exists on Mars. Early in the morning on the 18th, Mars was only 63 million miles from Earth, the shortest distance between the two planets in two years. Astronomers used the infrared spectrum of the 82-inch telescope developed during the war to discover that moss-like plants may be growing on Mars, and that there are also ice caps formed by water at the poles of Mars.</p>

The recommendations include (1) increased production, (2) markets and distribution, (3) storage of food supplies in various regions, and (4) price stabilization.</p>

Chile has calmly dealt with this threat to peace and the safety of its people on many occasions, but the Americas today is not in a state of disarmament and disunity, so it cannot tolerate the encroachment of any power outside the Americas. The Chilean President concluded by saying that those who attempt to subvert the UN Charter and international law should remember that such aggression is directed against all countries in the Americas."</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that Britain will again submit a note to Argentina and Chile, insisting that the South Antarctic territorial dispute should be submitted to the Hague International Court of Justice for judgment. The spokesman declined to say whether Britain accepts Argentina's proposal to submit the matter to an international conference for resolution, saying only that it is a legal issue that should be resolved by the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>[United Press, Capital of Argentina, 17th] The newspapers in this city today took a reserved attitude towards the dispute between Britain and Argentina over Antarctic land, saying that although the fleet had sailed to the disputed area, both Argentina and Chile hoped for a peaceful resolution and did not intend to cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Three Countries Compete for the Falkland Islands; Uranium Mines Play a Role</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] The "News Chronicle" and "Daily Mail" hinted to readers that there may be uranium mines or gold deposits underground in the Falkland Islands.</p>
<p>[British News Service] The dispute over the Falkland Islands with Argentina and Chile has become a matter of global attention.</p>
<p>The Falkland Islands are originally a small island in South America, located at 51 to 53 degrees west longitude and 57.40 to 61.25 degrees south latitude. The islands have more than 100 mountains and a total area of 6,500 square miles. They were first discovered by the Englishman Davis in 1592. Two years later, Hopkins completed the first voyage on the north coast of the islands. In 1764, the French explorer Bougainville occupied the island and established a colony in Port Louis on the island. Three years later, France ceded the island to Spain. However, the year after the French occupied the islands, the British Navy sent Colonel Byron to occupy it based on the fact that Britain was the first to discover the island. Although Britain and Spain occupied the island together, they did not infringe on each other. This continued until 1769, when disputes gradually arose between the troops stationed by the two countries. In 1771, Spain and Britain signed a treaty formally ceding the island to British occupation, which was the first time that British sovereignty over the island was recognized internationally, and also the historical basis for the British Foreign Office's statement of protecting its rights.</p>
<h3>Truman Calls on Housewives to Implement a "Buycott" Movement to Combat High Cost of Living</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman addressed the National Women's Conference here today, hinting that he approved of American housewives organizing a "buycott" movement to force food prices down. Truman said: Women's groups have a ready-made weapon that has not yet been used, which is the power of consumers. This weapon can combat the enemy that is currently threatening the country - the high cost of living.</p>
<h3>De Valera Meets a Strong Opponent; Prime Minister's Position Shakes</h3>

<h3>British Heir Apparent Visits Court to Hear Case of Naughty Children</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] Princess Elizabeth, lightly dressed and unescorted, went to the Tower Bridge Juvenile Court today to hear the case of naughty children. At first, no one noticed, but an hour later she was discovered, and everyone immediately became nervous. A twelve-year-old girl with beautiful hair clung to her mother shamefully and cried, "No matter what she thinks of me, I will never be naughty again."</p>
<h3>New York Times Launches Facsimile Newspaper; Another Innovation in the Newspaper Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The New York Times has made another innovation in modern news transmission. It is now broadcasting a four-page facsimile newspaper to 14 department stores in New York every day from its radio station. The broadcast time is from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day during the stores' business hours, which is the first successful large-scale experiment in using wireless facsimile to broadcast news after the war. This wireless facsimile newspaper is about one-quarter the size of a regular newspaper, and one page is a women's edition. The news in the facsimile newspaper is broadcast in the font of a new type of typewriter. Each piece of news takes three and a half minutes. The Times cannot yet predict when this type of wireless facsimile version will be widely subscribed to, because the equipment for recording facsimile news is very expensive and production is still low. At the same time, the need for wireless facsimile is still limited by the horizon, so if you want to have this type of wireless facsimile newspaper nationwide, you first need to set up a group of radio stations. However, the Times' publication of the facsimile newspaper at least foreshadows new developments in the future of the newspaper industry.</p>
<h3>Southern Siam is Peaceful; Separatist Movement Has Been Eliminated; New Parliament to Decide on New Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 17th] Siamese Minister of the Interior Bukatdi said after inspecting the southern provinces that the southern provinces are very peaceful, the separatist movement has no public support, and after the government took steps to meet the demands of the Muslim residents, the turmoil has disappeared invisibly. The special police sent there do not need to handle separatist movement cases and are now engaged in stopping smuggling activities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 18th] The new Siamese Parliament will be formally established tomorrow. The two houses will also hold meetings on February 20 to elect speakers and members of various committees. According to the latest news: the Regency Council has scheduled a meeting on the 21st, and the candidates for the new prime minister will be decided at the meeting.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Passes Bill on Military Missions Abroad</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. House of Representatives again passed a bill and submitted it to the Senate for action. The bill would extend the President's wartime authority to appoint military missions stationed in countries other than the Americas and the Philippines. This legislation has been pending since last year and has now received support from the State Department and the Department of the Army and Navy. If this bill is not passed, it may cause the withdrawal of the existing U.S. military missions in China and Iraq. As for the missions in Turkey and Greece, they are stipulated in special legislation.</p>
<h3>Solar Eclipse on May 9th; Visible in Manila</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 17th, United Press] On May 9th this year, a rare solar eclipse will occur when the moon enters the penumbra. The observation time is from 9:18 a.m. to 10:41 a.m. At approximately 9:18 a.m., the shadow of the moon will cover 60% of the sun's surface.</p>
<h3>U.S. Strictly Controls Exports; Chinese Merchants Request Export Licenses to Be Recommended by the Embassy; Gasoline Export Licenses Also Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Report from Washington by our newspaper] The United States has now implemented a new export licensing policy, which imposes stricter restrictions on the export of various important goods, and also restricts the purchase orders placed directly with U.S. exporters by government procurement agencies of various countries or the self-transportation of materials purchased by government purchasing agencies of various countries stationed in the United States. Export licenses for goods destined for private importers will be given priority in order to encourage the expansion of private trade. Therefore, in the future, the government procurement agencies of our country or the World Trade Corporation will have to purchase goods from the United States within the U.S. export quota for our country; and the quota is often less than what our country actually needs to import.</p>
<p>When the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration approves export licenses for goods destined for our country, if our government wants to "recommend" this, it must be handled by the Commercial Counselor's Office of our Embassy in the United States. The U.S. side agrees to this recommendation before the export license can be issued; otherwise, the application will be returned. In addition, recently, American merchants intend to purchase tens of thousands of yuan of firecrackers and tens of thousands of yuan of fishhooks from our country. It is heard that the Commercial Counselor's Office in the United States has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to contact exporters nearby. Another Canadian merchant intends to directly negotiate with our country's exporters to purchase hardware tools, and our country's Commercial Counselor's Office in the United States has replied by introducing them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. Department of Commerce today suspended the issuance of export licenses for gasoline and other petroleum products to various countries, except Canada. It is hoped that the suspension of these licenses will only last for a few days. During these few days, the Department of Commerce hopes to learn from the U.S. embassies and consulates in various countries the amount by which the consumption of U.S. gasoline has been reduced.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Senate Banking Committee today unanimously passed a bill extending the government's control over tin, fats, oils and certain other scarce items until after June 1949. The current control authority will expire at the end of this month. The House Banking Committee only passed an extension of one month.</p>
<h3>U.S. Announces Emergency Allocation; Linseed Oil to Be Shipped to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an emergency allocation today, which will ship 220,000 pounds of linseed oil to China.</p>
<h3>Memoirs of Hull (25)</h3>
<p>— Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance, compiled by this newspaper's translation department</p>
<p>The arrow of aggression is notched on the bow, about to be released</p>
<p>On January 27th, Grew telegraphed me from Tokyo, stating that the Peruvian diplomatic representative in Japan had told him that he (the Peruvian representative) had heard from many sources (including a Japanese source) that Japanese armed forces would suddenly launch a massive attack on Pearl Harbor when a "dispute" occurred between the United States and Japan, and that Japan would use all kinds of weapons in this attack. The secretary representative told Grew that he believed the news must be passed on, he said. The next day, we forwarded the telegram to the War Department and the Navy Department.</p>
<p>Around this time and under these circumstances, two Catholic priests returned to the United States from Japan. One was Bishop Walsh, the president of the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America in New York, and the other was Father Traut.</p>
<p>They reported that they had spoken with many prominent Japanese figures (including Matsuoka); they knew that relations between the two countries were becoming tense, and a worse situation would follow. They both had admirable desires to do their best as ordinary citizens to prevent war.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they contacted Postmaster General Walker, the most powerful Catholic in the U.S. government, and on the other hand, they met with officials from the Japanese Ambassador's office.</p>
<p>The President and I agreed that Bishop Walsh and Father Traut should continue to maintain contact with the Japanese Embassy in a purely private capacity and try to record the Japanese side's thoughts in writing. However, we felt that we ourselves could not take any action until the new Japanese Ambassador Nomura arrived in Washington.</p>
<p>Ambassador Nomura paid his first visit to me on February 12th. He was tall and healthy, with an honest face, very different from the physique of ordinary Japanese people. His English was sometimes good and sometimes not very proficient. His characteristic was seriousness, but often he made unhappy smiles and bows. I believed that Nomura was very sincere in his efforts to prevent war between the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>I had my first long conversation with Nomura on March 8th at my apartment in the Carlton Hotel. This was the first of fifty to sixty conversations we held before the Pearl Harbor incident. The talks were held at night, in the reading room of my apartment, first at the Carlton Hotel and later at the Wardman Park Hotel. Nomura preferred to come to my apartment rather than the State Department in order to minimize the chances of our conversations being reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>In these discussions, there were many frank words, but our voices never exceeded the level of a conversational tone. Nomura was courteous, and we maintained very harmonious personal relations.</p>
<p>Our initial conversations were limited to Nomura and myself, later including my advisors and Nomura's advisors.</p>
<p>The State Department's outstanding Japanese expert, Blunden, always came to my apartment at 7:45 p.m., bringing various necessary documents and discussing them with me. Nomura and his advisors arrived before 8:30 p.m., and the talks often continued until 10 p.m., sometimes 10:30 p.m. Blunden then returned to the State Department to prepare a memorandum of the conversation.</p>
<p>The informal talks conducted by Bishop Walsh, Father Traut, and Postmaster General Walker with Japanese representatives (including Ambassador Nomura) had made some headway by April 9th. On that day, I received from them a draft proposal that the participants had already agreed upon. In the following days, I carefully reviewed its contents with experts in Far Eastern affairs within the State Department.</p>
<p>As we studied the proposal, our disappointment was great. The proposal was not as easily acceptable as we had imagined; most of the clauses were what those radical Japanese imperialists could have hoped for.</p>
<p>After our Far Eastern experts and I had finished reviewing the proposal forwarded by Postmaster General Walker, my conclusion was that there were several points that should be opposed, several points that could be accepted as they were, and several points that could be accepted after revision. I felt that any opportunity that could lead to large-scale negotiations with the Japanese should not be ignored. Therefore, I invited Nomura to come and see me at my newly moved-in apartment at the Wardman Park Hotel.</p>
<p>I stated to Nomura that I had received an informal proposal regarding the resolution of disputes between our two countries, and added that I knew that the Japanese Ambassador himself had participated in the plan and was aware of its contents.</p>
<p>Nomura quickly replied that he was fully aware of the contents of the document. Although he had not yet submitted it to his government, he firmly believed that his government would approve it.</p>
<p>Two days later, I handed Nomura a statement including four basic principles at my apartment. I explained to him that these four principles must be emphasized in any agreement we might reach. The contents of the four principles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and all nations.</p>
<p>(2) Support for the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
<p>(3) Support for the principle of equality (including equal opportunities for trade).</p>
<p>(4) No alteration of the status quo in the Pacific, except by peaceful means.</p>
<p>I told Nomura that after these four principles were accepted, if he submitted the informal document prepared by private parties from both the United States and Japan to his government, and if his government approved it and instructed him to present it to us, then it could become the basis for starting negotiations.</p>
<p>Nomura forwarded the April 9th document, along with my four points and other comments, to Tokyo, and we waited for the Japanese response.</p>
<p>On May 7th, Nomura came to my humble abode again. He presented a proposal from the Japanese government, advocating that the United States and Japan should immediately conclude a non-aggression pact. Without hesitation, I quickly put this issue aside. I said, "This is completely different from your April 9th document. Our government does not want to consider anything other than the basic principles used as the basis for negotiation."</p>
<p>Nomura also said that he had received a telegram from Matsuoka, but pointed out that much of the content was "incorrect". He asked me if he could give me the telegram. I thought for a moment, and then replied to him, "Since there are so many mistakes in it, if he has the power to do so, it would be better for him to keep the telegram; because, as he has indicated, Matsuoka's text has rejected most or many parts of the April 9th document, so there will be no progress." Nomura then took back the telegram.</p>
<p>In fact, we already knew the contents of the telegram. It included Matsuoka's statement to me, saying that the German and Italian leaders firmly believed that victory could be obtained, and that American participation in the European war would only prolong it, causing the destruction of civilization, and also explained that Japan could not harm the position of her allies. How did we know the contents of the telegram? In fact, our army and navy code experts, with their superb skills, had deciphered the Japanese code, intercepted government telegrams from Tokyo to Washington and other capitals, translated them, and submitted them to the State Department for reference.</p>
<p>These intercepted telegrams called our code name "Magic". In the initial negotiations, these telegrams played a small role, but in the final stages, they were very important. From these telegrams, we learned of the instructions given by the Japanese Foreign Minister to Nomura and other Japanese representatives, and we could also examine how Nomura reported the contents of his conversations with us to Tokyo. These telegrams showed that Japan was still actively pursuing its conquest plans while negotiating peace with us. I saw these telegrams as I saw a witness contradicting his own case. Of course, I had to be very careful not to let Nomura know in the slightest that we had this special intelligence. I had to note that our conversations were limited to the information I obtained from him or through normal diplomatic channels. To ensure the security of these telegrams, I assigned one of my secretaries to handle and preserve them, ensuring that they must be returned to the Navy Department or destroyed.</p>
<p>On May 12th, Nomura gave me a completely new document, which was a draft agreement prepared by the Japanese side, with an "oral explanation" of various proposals attached.</p>
<p>We have now obtained the official proposal from the Japanese side. As of May 12th, the foundation for negotiations had been laid, and the negotiations continued until the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident, with only one interruption.</p>
<p>The light of hope radiating from the document was very dim. Most of what Japan proposed was beneficial to itself. In fact, it demanded that the United States and Japan jointly maintain a superior position in the Pacific, while Japan assumed the role of baron, encompassing ninety percent of the population and wealth, with little regard for the rights and interests of other countries.</p>
<p>A straightforward refusal would be tantamount to giving up the only real opportunity we had gained in months to engage in fundamental discussions with the Japanese side about the outstanding issues between us.</p>
<p>As a result, we decided to proceed with negotiations in accordance with the Japanese proposal.</p>
<p>When the Japanese government realized that we were willing to use the May 12th proposal as a basis for discussion, they immediately began to act, not proposing more amicable suggestions in our direction, but moving in the opposite direction. The content of the proposal was changed again and again, so that it was more in line with the imperialistic ambitions of themselves and their Axis allies.</p>
<p>We had very reliable information about everything Japan was planning. On the surface, the Imperial Conference was held in Tokyo on July 2nd; then, military steps of an alarming nature began. One to two million people were called up, Japanese merchant ships were suddenly recalled from the Atlantic, travel restrictions were implemented in Japan, and mail and communications were strictly checked. The various steps taken indicated that Japan was preparing for a large-scale war.</p>
<p>In fact, the Japanese government telegrams we intercepted also gave us equally alarming news. A telegram sent from Tokyo to Berlin on July 2nd included the following radical passages regarding policy:</p>
<p>(1) This Empire is determined to pursue a policy of promoting world peace, and regardless of how the world situation changes, is determined to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>(2) The Imperial Government will continue to work to end the China Incident and will take steps southward in order to establish a solid foundation for self-preservation and self-defense.</p>
<p>On the same day, Matsuoka sent a telegram to Nomura saying: "Preparations for the southward advance will be strengthened, and the policy already decided for Vietnam and Thailand (Siam) will be implemented. As for the German-Soviet war, although the spirit of the three axes should be maintained, everything must be prepared at present to deal with the situation in our own way. At the same time, diplomatic negotiations should be conducted with extreme caution. Although every means should be used to prevent the United States from participating in the war, if necessary, Japan will act in accordance with the Tripartite Pact and decide when and how to use force.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Japanese troops occupied southern Vietnam on July 21st, holding the entire French strategic province, like a huge thumb pointing towards the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, Welles called me from White Sulphur Springs, saying that Nomura had requested to meet with him, and asked me how to talk to Nomura.</p>
<p>I told him that the invasion of southern Vietnam seemed to be the last step before Japan's large-scale offensive in the South Pacific. I said that since Japan was attacking Vietnam in the midst of negotiations, I did not think there was any reason to continue the negotiations. Welles forcefully told Nomura these comments, and told him that I had decided to end our negotiations.</p>
<p>Since then, our main goal regarding Japan has been to give ourselves enough time to prepare for defense.</p>

<h3>Annihilating the Remnant Bandits on the Qing Song Border; Thirteen Killed and Dozens Captured Near An Zhuang; Rumor has it that Bandit Leader Ding Xishan has also been Killed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the small groups of bandits wandering on the Qing Song border were wiped out by the national army and local self-defense forces for several days, they have been divided into two groups. One group escaped from Phoenix Mountain to An Zhuang and has been surrounded and annihilated by the garrison troops. In addition to the 13 bandits killed on the spot, 44 people were captured. It is reported that Ding Xishan, the bandit leader, was also identified among the bandits killed. Another group is still wandering in the Tianma Mountain area, and has been tightly surrounded by the local army. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate them. The Municipal Garrison Headquarters issued a public announcement for the first time yesterday to confirm this matter.</p>
<p>A small number of communist bandits from Ding Xishan's unit, who landed in Punan, were led by Ding Xishan himself, about fifty people, wandering around Tianma Mountain. At 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, this group of bandits suddenly appeared in Phoenix Mountain. The pursuing troops tracked and suppressed them, and the bandits fled through Tiansheng Village south through Ao Township to Shang'an Village, trying to sneak into Dianshan Lake. However, the Qingpu County troops had completed their deployment in advance, and all ports of Dianshan Lake from Zhujie Pavilion to Zhangliantang were completely blocked. Qingpu County Chief Liu Jin and Wang Jialiang, the captain of the People's Self-Defense Force, arrived at Zhushu Pavilion early to direct everything. Qingpu County town was also on alert all night, and the lights were not turned off all night (usually the power supply only lasts until 12:00 p.m.). Until dawn yesterday morning, the bandits arrived near An Zhuang, and first sent three people (one in plain clothes and two in gray uniforms) posing as the Third Clearance District and Songjiang Self-Defense Force troops, forcibly pulled civilian boats and ordered them to carry the large army into the lake. The boatman said that the lake was unstable and it would be difficult to pass, and asked them to contact the police stationed in An Zhuang first. When the bandits heard that there were police stationed in An Zhuang, they knew they were prepared and planned to turn back. However, the An Zhuang water police team had already received the news and chased after them, firing shots. The bandits dared not fight and fled to Youwan (30 miles from Qingpu and 5 miles from An Zhuang). At that time, Zhu Changzhong, deputy commander of the Third District Security, had personally led the security troops to arrive. Gao Daoxing, the regimental commander of the Youth Army ×th Regiment, Xing Zuyuan, the deputy regimental commander, Zhang, the battalion commander of the ×th Battalion, and Zhu, the captain of the Qingpu Security Second Company, also led their troops to arrive. So a large encirclement of the bandits was carried out, and a fierce battle was launched in the triangle area of Nanyouwan, Beiyouwan, and Caowangxu. Xie Chengbing, the commissioner of the Third District, also arrived at that time and personally supervised the battle with the county chiefs of Song Qing. The bandits lay prone in the marshes and wetlands, resisting stubbornly. The battle lasted for six hours. The national army fired cannons, and the bandits began to collapse. By 2:50 p.m., they had all disintegrated. In addition to the 13 people who were killed on the spot, the remaining 44 people were captured. It is reported that Ding Xishan was also identified among the bandits killed. The bandit corpses and captured bandits will be transferred to Qingpu today. Commissioner Xie and Deputy Commander Zhu stayed overnight in Qing and discussed the disposal plan and continued clearance plan with the commanders of various troops all night. As for the weapons seized, they are still being investigated. It is said that three light machine guns and three Thomson guns have been confirmed.</p>
<p>However, at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, it was reported that another group of communist bandits was suddenly discovered in Dongshentanjing, Beiganshan, Qingpu County. They came from Tianma Mountain, Songjiang, with about fifty people, carrying eight light machine guns, and seemed to be moving towards Heshangjing. After hearing the news, the townships and towns near Beiganshan dispatched self-defense teams to search and block attacks in different areas. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the bandits forcibly requisitioned five civilian boats in Heshangjing and fled back to Tianma Mountain. According to the authorities' observation, the reason why the bandits urgently wanted to return by boat was because there were more large ports near Tianma Mountain, which made it easier to move. However, Xie Commissioner Liu County Chief, etc. ordered the troops from Youwan District to rush to pursue them last night, and it is expected that they will be completely annihilated today.</p>

<h3>Various Circles in Songjiang Actively Launch a Campaign to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>In Songjiang County, the good news spread throughout the city at 3:30 p.m., and the people were all overjoyed. All circles in Songjiang launched a campaign to comfort the troops, presided over by Nong Peter, inspector of the Third District Office. As of now, 20 million yuan has been raised. Inspector Nong visited Xiong Kaiyu, the chief of staff, at 5:00 p.m. to contact him to reward the troops who have contributed to this bandit suppression.</p>
<p>According to Chief of Staff Xiong, we obtained intelligence about Ding's attempt to invade several months ago. All counties in Punan under the jurisdiction of the Third District conducted a major investigation in January, searching households one by one. At that time, many members of the bandit party who were hiding were arrested and sent to the respective county governments for rehabilitation. The fact that no local natives responded to the bandits' landing this time proves that Ding's old potential power in the Punan area has been eliminated and cannot play a role.</p>
<p>As for another bandit leader, Tang Jingfeng, leading more than a dozen remnant bandits, appeared once in Yanduntou, Punan, the day before yesterday. However, after the local self-defense teams and others went to search yesterday, they found nothing. Tang may have crossed the river to Pubei and joined the remnant bandits of Tianma Mountain at night, but it is currently impossible to confirm whether Tang is indeed among the remnant bandits of the Tianma Mountain group.</p>
<p>Patrolling and Guarding the Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Songjiang-Jiaxing section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway still dispatched traffic police and road police to patrol and guard all day yesterday to prevent scattered bandits from destroying the railway. The person in charge of He Song police affairs near Shihutang was stationed at Shihutang Station yesterday to guard against accidents because it was close to An Zhuang.</p>
<p>Three Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Because the remaining criminals have not been suppressed, Songjiang City was still under martial law starting at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. The self-defense team of Cunren Township in Songjiang arrested a suspect yesterday. According to the confession: named Xu Mingfu, from Xinghua, Northern Jiangsu. The traffic police machine gun company stationed at Xinzhuang Station also arrested two communist bandit suspects who attempted to buy tickets to Jiaxing the day before yesterday, and dry food was found on them.</p>
<h3>Ding Xishan, Who Was Rumored to Have Been Killed</h3>
<p>Bandit leader Ding Xishan, a native of Zhuanghang, Fengxian, was a well-known bandit in the local area before the war. In 1936, he was arrested and imprisoned. He was released after the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan and participated in the guerrillas, active in Pudong and Punan. Later, he surrendered to the puppet government and served as the commander of the Puppet Provisional 13th Division, stationed in Songjiang. The area around Beiqiao and Punan was very powerful, and no one on both sides of the Pujiang River did not know his name. Later, he tried to defect again, but was discovered by the Japanese army, arrested and imprisoned. He was released on bail by Li Shiqun, a traitor, and transferred to the free area for training. A few months before the victory, he led his team to sneak into Fengxian. After the restoration and reorganization, Ding was incorporated into the traffic police team. Last summer, he was wanted by the Ministry of National Defense due to a case, so Ding secretly joined the bandits, gathered old troops, and went to the bandit area in Northern Jiangsu for training.</p>
<h3>National Salvation and Reconstruction Train Parade Today</h3>
<p>The National Salvation and Reconstruction Train Parade of all circles in this city is scheduled to be held this afternoon. Dozens of units, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Garrison Command, the Municipal Police Bureau, and various industrial and commercial groups, participated in the train, and were all equipped with huge cartoons and wonderful arrangements. The Municipal National Salvation and Reconstruction Propaganda Corps, the Municipal Party Headquarters Propaganda Brigade, and the exiled student propaganda team will also participate in costume performances and speeches.

<h3>Military Service Conference to be Held on the 29th</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the Municipal Military Service Association, Chen Quanqiao, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, and Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, jointly decided yesterday to convene a military service conference on the 29th of this month.

<h3>Winter Relief Conference Discusses Distribution of Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The fourth meeting of the Municipal Winter Relief Association was held at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the municipal government meeting room. More than 20 people in charge from all circles attended. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) The women's volunteer winter clothing fundraising team recently transferred 5,000 sets of winter clothing to the Winter Relief Association. The Social Bureau is now convening persons in charge from various provinces to coordinate the distribution according to the number of refugees. (2) The non-staple food expenses for each shelter in this city were originally set at 80,000 yuan per person per month, but have now been increased to 120,000 yuan. (3) The No. 3 Shelter on Jungong Road was originally a reception center for unemployed workers, so management is very difficult.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Municipal councilors have been reporting to the secretariat of the council for the past few days to prepare to attend the fifth general assembly. As of yesterday, a total of 55 people had reported and seven proposals had been received. Regarding the issue of house rentals, no councilors have yet submitted proposals. According to the standards for house rentals, the municipal government should formulate them, and the council only has the right to decide. The municipal government is currently discussing various issues related to the case, and will submit them to the general assembly for resolution after they are sorted out. In addition, the new tax increase measures newly ordered by the Finance Bureau are also being sorted out, so that they can be submitted to the general assembly for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the prisoner's secret report on the inside story of Shanghai Prison, a Japanese speaker at the council stated: The Municipal Council usually receives many secret letters from citizens. The council should appeal for citizens, so after receiving such letters, they are forwarded to the relevant authorities for reference. It is not up to the council to ask whether the competent authorities handle them. As for publishing the news, the right rests with the council, so there is no question of responsibility, and there is no legal basis for questioning.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle on the Shores of Dianshan Lake: Bandit Gang from Wu County Crushed; Guns Seized, Eight Bandits Captured</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] A contingent of Communist bandits has been harassing the southwestern border of this county for days, attempting to infiltrate Chenmu. At 11 a.m. on the 18th, the Taihu Anti-Bandit Command's Su Kun Sub-District ordered a campaign to suppress them. Commander Peng Tong, leading the 2nd Company of the Youth Army, in coordination with the Baoan Teng Self-Defense Force, set out to search. They encountered the bandits on the shores of Dianshan Lake, where the counties of Wu, Wujiang, and Qingpu meet, and engaged in a fierce battle for four hours, forcing the bandits to retreat. In this battle, one machine gun, three Mauser pistols, and six rifles were seized, and eight bandits were captured. The bandits retreated towards the vicinity of the Zhexu market town in Wujiang County. The unit has telegraphed the Wujiang County government to intercept them. It is confirmed that the bandit unit is part of Ding Xishan's force. The bandit leader, Gu Fusheng, has approximately 300 men, carrying nine machine guns, fifty Mauser pistols, and over thirty rifles. Suzhou County Magistrate Wang Jiefo, responding to the urgent situation in Chenmu, personally went to oversee the defense and mobilized local militia forces for battle. Alarms are frequent, and the people are restless. Furthermore, it is reported that Wujiang County received an alarm on the 16th, stating that bandits were appearing to infiltrate, and immediately ordered a curfew. On the 17th, a platoon of the Youth Army arrived to reinforce the defense, and the curfew was lifted. Currently, the county's security police force is strengthening patrol efforts and maintaining strict vigilance.</p>
<h3>Wounded Nationalist Army Squad Leader Arrives in Qingpu; Crowds Flock to the Wharf to Express Sympathy</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] An Pingya, 31 years old, from Lianshui, a squad leader (lance corporal) in the × Company, × Battalion, × Regiment of the Youth Army, who was wounded in the anti-bandit operation near Anzhuang, Qingpu, was immediately escorted to Qingpu by merchants and residents of Zhujiege via hired boat after being wounded yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the residents of Qingpu flocked to the wharf to express their sympathy. Despite his injuries, An frequently raised his hand in salute (see photo, taken by this newspaper) to show his gratitude. The Qingpu County government specially allocated 10 million yuan, and the Qinghu Motor Army Company also dispatched a large motor vehicle, with Liu Jingguo, a famous doctor from Qingpu, accompanying the vehicle to escort him to Shanghai for treatment. Although wounded, An's spirits are excellent. According to his interview with reporters: "The majority of the Communist bandits are wearing grey uniforms, with no insignia on their hats. After arriving at Anzhuang, their ranks were disorganized, their equipment was incomplete, and they abandoned backpacks and water bottles along the way, which proves that they have long lacked the will to fight. With a little encirclement and suppression, they can easily be completely annihilated." Currently, the hearts of the people in Qingpu city and various towns are calm, and they are living as usual. The garrison's strength is strong, and public safety is definitely not a problem.</p>

<h3>Rationed Sugar Continues to Be Sold, Price at 12,000 per Pound</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Food Sugar Group of the Shanghai Commodity Price Evaluation Council held its 21st consultation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday, deciding that the 10th phase of rationed sugar would continue to be sold. The allocated price is 9,000 yuan per pound, plus 3,000 yuan for advertising, district security fees, and sugar certificate printing fees, resulting in a selling price of 12,000 yuan per pound. The original allocation was one catty per resident, but the Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar) requires more than 4.3 million catties of rationed sugar to be allocated each phase. The allocated price differs greatly from the market price, resulting in significant losses, so they requested that from the 10th phase, it be changed to half a catty per person. The small group hopes to maintain the allocation of one catty per person. The distribution quantity will be determined after the chairman of the Commodity Price Evaluation Council, Wu Kaixian, consults with the chairman of Taisugar, Mr. Wu, and then distribution can begin.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Rice Price Limits, No Exceeding 1,908,000; Economic Police Conducted City-Wide Inspections Yesterday; 10,000 Shi of Rice Still Being Released Daily</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the rise in rice prices in this city still had not been curbed. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau released a total of 10,000 shi of rice at the North and South markets at the original price of 1,750,000 yuan. However, it was stipulated that each business firm be allocated 40 shi of rice, and each rice shop be allocated 5 shi of rice. Mayor Wu had previously discussed stabilization measures with rice merchants, restricting the price of rice sold in retail shops to a maximum of 1,908,000 yuan, and the price of freely purchased rice to a maximum of 1,980,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Rice Shop Guild of this city, Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Xu Ziwen, Yin Fuxiang, and Ren Xianqun, representing the grain storage industry, totaling more than ten people, accompanied by Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 5 p.m. yesterday, detailing the difficult situation of the volatile rice market, requesting the municipal authorities to increase the amount of rice released to ensure sufficient distribution to all rice shops, and requesting an increase in the retail price of rice.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants' Requests Difficult to Accept</p>
<p>After meeting with the rice merchants, Mayor Wu told reporters: "The city government finds it difficult to accept the rice merchants' requests. According to the central government's decision, this city will implement full per capita grain allocation starting in March. Currently, the city government is still releasing 10,000 dan of rice daily. To meet the insufficient supply, rice shops must provide a rice quantity equal to their allocation to the market, but the price must not exceed 1,980,000 yuan (including legal profits). According to Mayor Wu, the price limits will be strictly enforced, and economic police have been dispatched since yesterday to conduct city-wide inspections. Those who sell rice exceeding the price limit will be severely punished."</p>
<p>Several Shops Found to Have Exceeded Price Limits</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Economic Police Bureau investigated and discovered eleven rice merchants who exceeded the price limits or sold inferior rice.

<h3>Homicide Occurs on College Road: Body of an Ugly Woman Covered in Marks of Violence; Police Bureau Offers 10 Million Yuan Reward for Apprehension of Criminal</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau of the Nanshi District, based on a report from Police Officer Liu Wensheng of the Dalign Bridge Police Station, stated: "An unidentified female corpse was discovered outside the bamboo fence at the entrance of Alley 148, College Road, covered in a quilt stained with blood, suspected to be murdered." Upon receiving the report, Sub-Bureau Chief Shen immediately ordered Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan to personally lead Inspector Fan and officers Wang Wenjie and others to the scene to investigate, and notified the Criminal Affairs Division of the General Bureau to send personnel to take photographs. An examination of the wrapped quilt revealed that it was tightly bound with two electric wires and a grass rope. Upon opening the quilt, the female corpse, over forty years old, with thick eyebrows and a sunken nose, and one gold tooth in her mouth, was found. She was very ugly. Her head and the right side of her cheeks were pierced with a knife, the flesh was blurred, the neck bone was exposed, her right arm was slashed four times, her right hand was cut off, and her finger flesh was tattered. She was wearing a purple-red wool shirt and vest, with a white cotton undershirt underneath. Her lower body was exposed, with a pink checkered silk trousers lying between her thighs. She wore a round gold earring on her left ear, but her right ear was slashed and tattered. Marks of violence were found on her arms and fingers, and her lower body was naked, leading to the conclusion that she was first raped and then killed, and that she had resisted at some point. Furthermore, as the corpse had not yet discolored, it can be determined that no more than ten hours have passed since the incident. The corpse was positioned with its head facing south and its feet facing north, indicating that the murderer dragged the corpse from the alley from south to north after the incident and moved it to that location. Traces on the ground have been obscured due to rain and crowds of people, making it difficult to discern. According to the officers handling the case, based on the above indications, it is undoubtedly a case of corpse relocation. Furthermore, given that the quilt was torn and scattered, it is speculated that the victim was not yet dead when the murderer abandoned the body, hence her vigorous struggle. However, inquiries with nearby residents have yielded no information. In the afternoon, two police dogs from the General Bureau were brought to the scene to sniff around in order to solve the case. The previous Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau has specially offered a reward of ten million yuan for the apprehension of the criminal.</p>
<h3>Perpetrator of Kidnapping Case in Changzhou Flees to Shanghai and is Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] On the 31st of last month, Pan Shixian, a police officer of the Zhabei Police Sub-Bureau, reported that Han Huanda, residing at No. 8 Panjiawan, Zhabei, and Song Laowu, residing at No. 28 Furen Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, were behaving suspiciously. The two were apprehended and taken to the bureau for questioning. It was learned that Han and others had kidnapped Yue Shiying's only son, Guiquan (23 years old), a fishmonger, from his home in the tenth Jia of the ninth Bao, Furong Township, fifth district, Yuejiatang, outside the east gate of their hometown of Changzhou, on December 28th of last year. They hid the hostage in the Sangjing residence. About ten days later, they sent letters to his family, demanding 500 dan of white rice. Yue Guizhen, the victim's sister, negotiated with the abductors twice without success. The third time, Yue Shengbao, a member of the same clan, came forward to negotiate, and the result was an agreement on a ransom of 100 dan of white rice, which was equivalent to 70 million yuan in national currency at the time. It was agreed that after the money was paid, the hostage would be released. Unexpectedly, the news spread locally, and they fled to Shanghai, hiding in the aforementioned locations. Section Chief Shi ordered officer Wang Changsheng and others to travel to Changzhou to work with the criminal police team of the Wujin Police Bureau to send personnel to Yuejiatang. The victim's father and son, Mr. Yue, happened to be in Hangzhou on business and were not met. Only the hostage's mother, Yue Ding Qiaodi, was met. She said that her son had indeed been kidnapped and a huge sum of money had been given in return. The case has now been investigated and completed, and the Han criminals were transferred to the court for punishment yesterday.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>
<p>— Li Han-hun</p>
<p>Mother of Parliaments</p>
<p>With the kind arrangement of the embassy and the reception and guidance of specially appointed officials from the parliament, accompanied by Secretary Run Ming from the embassy, I visited this "Mother of Parliaments" of the world. Upon first arriving in London, I had long admired this magnificent building, standing tall on the banks of the River Thames, with its exquisite and intricate details, seemingly made of granite. Therefore, I paid special attention to observing it.</p>
<p>Upon entering the main gate, rows of stone statues stood on both sides, seemingly protecting the dignity and solemnity of the parliament. Further in, I saw a round, domed ceiling, imposing and grand. The figures of people from the three islands painted above were remarkably exquisite. The long corridors on the left and right were adorned with numerous murals, a feast for the eyes. In addition, there were many famous paintings and sculptures. The House of Lords was on the left, with red furnishings; the House of Commons was on the right, with green furnishings. The contrast between red and green symbolized the urgency and relaxation of time and space. The Anglo-Saxon people expressed the spirit of their democratic politics within this natural setting. Looking up at the hall, my mind felt broadened.</p>
<p>First, I visited the House of Commons. Because the original site was bombed and has not yet been repaired, the House of Lords' chamber is temporarily used as a meeting place. The Speaker's chair was at the top, with members sitting opposite each other on both sides. The government party was on the right, and the opposition party was on the left. It is commonly said that the opposition party is the left wing, and the meaning of this term originated here. Members without seats sat on the lower benches or stood. This simple and relaxed arrangement controls the democratic destiny of the great British Kingdom and sets an example for history, making one linger and reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Next, I visited the House of Lords. Because the chamber was lent to the House of Commons, a not-so-grand hall was temporarily set up as a chamber. The Queen's seat was at the top. The throne was higher, and the Queen's seat was lower, which originated from the Victoria Queen, who was tall and majestic. This has remained unchanged, perhaps even more so than the adherence to ancestral rules in our country's dynasties. The Prince's seat was on the right, the Speaker's chair in front, and members' seats on both sides. The furnishings were very simple.</p>
<p>The debating chamber replaces the battlefield, and words replace bullets. Having been in battle for a long time, I can still appreciate the taste of the battlefield. It is a pity that I could not personally witness the spectacle of the Mother of Parliaments' spirited verbal duels. I felt a sense of regret. The guide, knowing that I had feelings about this, explained in detail the lively scenes of the parliament banging on tables and chairs and the House of Commons debating with the royal family. He also said that if the intense situation of the Chinese battlefield were moved to the parliament, the Chinese parliament would be even more lively than the British parliament. I remained silent.</p>
<p>I visited the libraries of both houses one after another and discovered that they contained the entire collection of The Times from 1700-odd years to the present, bound into giant volumes year by year, a spectacular sight. I deeply praised the importance of preserving its significance. All kinds of legal books were available. The British Parliament emphasized both facts and theories and valued both history and reality when enacting legislation. The Anglo-Saxon people are both thoughtful and practical, which can be seen in the richness of the parliamentary library collection and the precision of the legislation.</p>
<p>On both sides of the hall, there were paintings depicting Nelson and Wellington's fierce battles against Napoleon. History does not perish, and greatness lasts forever. Hundreds of years later, it still looks as vivid as life.</p>
<p>After visiting the various rooms, I saw a bronze plaque inscribed with "Innocent Man" inlaid on the ground in a certain hall on the lower level. According to the guide, in the past, an innocent man knelt and was questioned by the King. The result was that he was innocent. Later, this was cast at the kneeling trial site as a memorial. There were many such memorials. It is a subtle indication that culture does not perish, and truth does not perish.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I arrived at the spacious members' lounge behind. Below was the River Thames. To the left was the City Hall, and to the right was the hospital (a row of seven). Two long bridges were like the Golden Ao Jade Dong of Zhongnanhai in Beijing, with a magnificent view. Stepping out of the main gate, I looked up at the world's tallest square tower. The tower had a large clock with a long hand reaching 14 feet and a short hand of 9 feet. It was made in 1842. The clock keeps accurate time, with an annual difference of only one-third of a second. Before electric chains were used, it required two people to wind it for five hours each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The size of it can be imagined, which also adds to the splendor of the parliament.</p>
<p>Science Museum</p>
<p>Due to the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment, religious and feudal Europe was transformed into scientific and industrial Europe. This science and industry first blossomed and bore fruit in England, which had been peaceful and quiet, and had gradually led the royal family politics to the modern path of democracy without using bloody methods for hundreds of years. Due to the unrest in Europe, many European scientists in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries moved from the continent to England. Transforming scientific principles into practical science, machines were invented, and thus the industrial revolution took place in the British Isles in the 19th century. In order to seek the signs of the scientific principles and applications that liberated European civilization and saved the world from poverty, I invited Jufang and Zhaolun to visit the British Science Museum, the cradle of modern civilization.</p>
<p>The steam engine was the first tool to promote modern civilization. Visiting the steam engine invented in 1797, I imagined the greatness of modern power. Applying the steam engine to textiles made England the first most successful light industrial country. Applying the steam engine to transportation made trains and steamboats first appear in England. From light industry to heavy industry. By the mid-19th century, British light and heavy industries were already dominating the world. With the transportation industry as a medium, transporting the goods produced by light and heavy industries, the footprints of British merchants filled the world after the mid-19th century. Science sketched the outline of British science and industrial development. After the visit, it was like reading a history of scientific and industrial evolution.</p>
<p>In order to protect the development of commerce and industry, wars followed one after another. Taking airplanes as an example, it is not difficult to see the traces of their progress in the Science Museum. The museum displays a 1903 airplane, one of the first to be made. The gradual improvements of the 1907 and 1908 models, with the pilot's posture changing from lying down to standing up to turning forward, shows that the art of flying and manufacturing advanced together. Later, visiting the 1917 monoplane and the 1918 seaplane, as well as various models from later years, I realized that this industry is constantly changing and making continuous progress. It is no coincidence that today's giant aircraft soar through the universe, exploring and sightseeing without limits. Airplanes have their most important mission in the history of transportation and war. The exhibits in the museum have provided a very powerful explanation.</p>
<p>The discovery of uranium, the invention of atomic energy, and the development of other scientific principles are richly displayed in the museum with simple and concise explanations. Unfortunately, I am not a scientist and cannot easily understand its mysteries. The film describing the collision of atomic energy is not easy to see in the United States. Zhaolun, a chemical expert, was particularly interested in this.</p>
<p>It was the centennial of chemistry, and a special room was set up on the top floor of the museum for display. Seeing certain rays of light projected onto certain qualities and producing various special colors made me think of the colorful phenomena in movie musicals.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the Mass Organization Training Work in the Five Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi is Underway</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanchang, This Newspaper, 16th] "Suppressing bandits is the first priority, military affairs are the first priority, and mass organization training should be coordinated with the needs of suppressing bandits and military affairs, assisting in preventing the Communist bandits from fleeing, thoroughly suppressing scattered bandits, and consolidating local security." This is the first principle of Minister Bai Chongxi's mass organization training in the bandit suppression plan for the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi. He attached particular importance to the issue of mass organization. When Bai first came to Jiujiang to plan military operations for suppressing bandits in the five provinces, he spoke to reporters in his office, "How to reduce Liu Bocheng's bandit army in the future," and emphasized Chairman Chiang's famous saying during the bandit suppression in the 20th year of the Republic of China: "Three parts military, seven parts politics." He believed that future bandit suppression must win the assistance of the masses, focusing on "political bandit suppression." Therefore, he advocated that mass organization training should be widespread, in-depth, rapid, and effective, ensuring that everyone is included in various organizations to receive training, and that everyone participates in the suppression of the rebellion. He should also take into account the people's lives in terms of time and space, making them happy to accept. Based on his past experience and understanding of mass organization training in Guangxi Province.</p>
<p>When the governors of the five provinces held a joint defense meeting in Nanjing, the implementation measures for mass organization training were drafted and decided by him personally. In the implementation program, he advocated that for mass organizations, the supervisory and executive agencies should dispatch personnel to participate in their internal work, depending on their nature and current needs, so that they can play a leading role invisibly. In terms of training, they should first start with the leaders and important assistants of each organization in order to set an example, and then carry out general training.</p>
<p>The Jiujiang Command of the Ministry of National Defense is now issuing the implementation program for mass organization training in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi in accordance with Bai's principles of mass organization training. Its content: (A) Organization, training, and use of mass self-defense forces, (B) Organization and training of the general public.</p>
<p>All able-bodied men of grades A and B in each district, township, and bao will be fully registered in the roster of the district, township, and bao self-defense forces. The standing team (those who have left production and are paid by the county and city) should be organized into at least one battalion (under the jurisdiction of three companies).</p>
<p>Self-Defense Force Cadres</p>
<p>In addition to appointing officers from the officers' corps transferred from various provinces, outstanding retired officers in the countryside should be employed as much as possible. In addition to the half of their monthly salary already issued by the state, they should be treated in accordance with the county level. Those who do not comply will have their state benefits canceled.</p>
<p>In addition to those owned by the counties and cities, all publicly owned and privately owned weapons in the townships and towns shall be registered and organized in their own counties and cities to defend the local area. The central government absolutely guarantees the private ownership of private guns by the people. Military and political organs shall not extract them for any reason or under any pretext, or reorganize them into provincial teams or national defense forces. If they are lost or damaged due to bandit suppression operations, the provincial government shall compensate them. The consumption of ammunition shall be reported with the shell casings, and the central government shall allocate them back. All weapons privately owned by the counties, cities, districts, townships, baos, and the people shall be registered and organized. Those who hide weapons and fail to report for registration, or who fail to obey the order to be organized, shall be confiscated by the county and city governments and punished as private possession of military fire.</p>
<p>Mass Self-Defense Force</p>
<p>The use within the county and city borders or within the administrative inspector's district shall be the principle. When necessary, the standing self-defense force may be dispatched by the security commander of each province or the commander of the pacification zone to the county and city borders of adjacent administrative inspector's districts to assist the army or the teams in adjacent districts to perform the tasks of defense, alert, and suppression. When transferred out of the county's territory, all supplies shall still be issued by the original county and city. If they fail to be supplied on time for any reason, the county and city governments of the place where they are located may lend them, and the county and city governments of their origin shall be responsible for allocating them back afterwards.</p>
<p>The standing team and the armed teams of the townships and towns shall focus on spiritual education, shooting training, combat exercises, engineering construction, field service, and marching. Various task teams shall be given technical training in accordance with their nature. However, the training time and location must take into account the convenience of the people's lives. The provincial (district) security command shall be responsible for planning and supervising this training. The pacification zone command, the garrison command of various places, the command of the various divisions and regiments, and the stationed army shall all have the responsibility to guide and assist.</p>
<p>The provinces shall first strengthen the organization and training of the people's self-defense forces in the counties and cities adjacent to the bandit areas and along the rivers and rivers, and in the mountainous triangular areas and border areas, and strengthen the defense works of the central city fortresses, river defenses, and important strongholds. All passages, ferries, and key points must be watched day and night in shifts to prevent the intrusion of bandit scouts and scattered bandits. (Reporter Liu Zao of this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Joint Reserve Association of Silver and Money Shops Holds Second Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The second standing committee meeting of the general assembly of member shops of the Shanghai Joint Reserve Association of Silver and Money Shops was held at the Bankers' Club at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than 130 member representatives attended. The meeting was presided over by Li Fuxun, chairman of the executive committee of the association, and adjourned at 3:45 PM.</p>
<p>The chairman first summarized the association's affairs. The association has been preparing for its establishment since July 35 [1946], and there have been many twists and turns in its affairs over the past eighteen months. The highest amount of intra-bank lending for the entire year of 36 [1947] was 890 million in October. The principle was not to provide operating funds. Lending was based on treasury bills and limited to one day, with a maximum of three renewals. The total amount of lending for the whole year reached 22,368.4 million yuan. The total amount of expenses shared for the whole year was 976,850,183 yuan. The total amount of prepared assets at the end of the year 36 [1947] was 3,189.1 million yuan. The total amount of treasury bills was 2,232.3 million yuan. However, the association's treasury bill quota was adjusted from 10.5 billion to 22.3 billion in the first half of the year 36 [1947], and has not been adjusted since. Under the circumstances of rising prices and increasing deposits, the association felt that it was not able to compete effectively.</p>
<p>The discussion then began on (A) passing the final accounts for the upper and lower periods of 36 [1947], (B) passing the executive committee's proposal for member shops to freely subscribe to funds, a total of five items: (1) Within 1% of the total deposit amount, each member shop can freely subscribe, without restrictions, as the association's second fund. (2) The association will issue safekeeping receipts for the second fund, which can be included in the amount of treasury bills to be used. In case of exchange differences, they can be used to borrow from the association. (3) When the second fund is not lent out, interest will be calculated monthly at a rate of 1.2% per annum, according to the central bank's interbank fixed deposit rate. The interest will be credited to the original depositing shop. When borrowing, interest will not be calculated on deposits, but will be calculated on the loan, and will not be included in the monthly lending report.</p>
<p>(4) When the second fund is lent out, it will be calculated at the interbank lending rate. Three-quarters of the amount exceeding the interest rate in Article 3 will be paid to the depositing shop on a pro rata basis, and one-quarter will be retained by the association as a handling fee to cover expenses. (5) The second fund will be collected by the end of March this year, and the association will report the total amount subscribed by members to all members. Finally, Article 25 of Chapter 7 of the amended articles of association was passed.</p>
<h3>Non-Trading Stimulation Causes Buying Spree; Chinese Stocks Show Prosperous Trend at Closing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks received strong non-trading stimulation, with securities brokers and cloth merchants resuming buying. Although banks were selling, they continued to move upward gradually. Yongye and Huafeng rose to the limit, and the trend at the closing was very prosperous.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, news of US loans and environmental factors encouraged selling, and the market opened weak. Yongsai entered the market at 805 yuan and 801 yuan, showing an inverted trend. After the opening, No. 224 and other numbers were sold for immediate delivery, while No. 65 and other numbers were sold for deferred delivery, and immediately fell to 789 yuan and 790 yuan. No. 73 and other numbers were bought for immediate delivery, and No. 183 and others also bought for deferred delivery, rising back to 803 yuan and 805 yuan. No. 36 and other numbers sold off for immediate delivery, while No. 89 and others still sold for deferred delivery, falling again to 792 yuan and 794 yuan. No. 13 and other numbers bought for immediate delivery; No. 97 and other numbers bought for deferred delivery, and the outside interest rate fell as low as 22.5 cents and 27 cents, rising back to 818 yuan and 816 yuan. No. 69 and other numbers were still sold for immediate delivery, while No. 207 still offered for deferred delivery, falling to 807 yuan and 810 yuan, but because non-trading market prices such as cloth were very prosperous and money supply was very loose, Yongsai for deferred delivery showed an inverted trend. No. 157 and other numbers bought for immediate delivery, and No. 8 and other numbers bought for deferred delivery, rising to a high price of 830 yuan and 831 yuan near noon. The noon closing price was 824 yuan and 826 yuan. Among the small stocks that rebounded, Jingfu was the most prosperous. Compared with the previous closing price, stocks for immediate delivery such as Yongsai, Xinyue, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Zhongsai, and Huafeng rose slightly. Shangwu, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Shangping were flat, and the rest fell slightly. Stocks for deferred delivery such as Yongsai, Xinyue, and Huafeng rose slightly, Qinxing and Shangping were flat, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, deferred delivery was suspended as usual, and Yongsai for immediate delivery started from 85 yuan. Although No. 20 and other numbers sold off, No. 224 and other numbers bought up to 849 yuan. No. 181 and other numbers sold off, falling back to 838 yuan. Buying from foreign stocks and cloth was very strong, and market sentiment was still prosperous. No. 31 and other numbers bought up to 852 yuan. The National Bank bought a lot, and No. 156 and other numbers sold back down to 840 yuan. No. 157 and other numbers bought up to 850 yuan at the closing. Huafeng rose to the limit, and Yongye also approached the limit. As a result, compared with the morning closing, Huafeng and Yongye stocks for immediate delivery rose to the limit, Rongfeng rose less than 10%, Yongsai, Xinyue, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhabei, and Shangwu each rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. The market prices of various unlisted stocks outside the market were stable and even.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Advance; Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds advanced despite instability. Unified Bond C opened at 89,000, first saw 75,000, then rose to a high price of 90,000 yuan, and then ended in a range-bound market, with a turnover of about 6 million yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Group A, B, and C each rose by 2,000 yuan, and Group Ding and Wu each rose by 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the buying spree for foreign stocks expanded. The contraction of Hong Kong Electric caused hot stocks to reach new highs. Securities brokers sold, while Guangzhou brokers and foreign firms bought. Yisha opened at 660,000 in the morning and gradually rose to around 740,000 yuan at the closing. The afternoon was especially tight. Compared with the previous closing price, Hong Kong Telephone was flat, while Yisha, Yinglian, Yipie, Shipping, and Yueguang each rose by about 10%. Zengde, Non-Paper Edition, and Gangye each rose by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Reach New Highs; Social Bureau's Reduced Rice Sales Insufficient for Retail</h3>
<p>Although rice prices are under the close watch of the Economic Police, the rising trend continues to evolve, reaching new highs. The Social Bureau continues to sell in the north and south markets separately. The amount allocated to each merchant has been reduced to 40 dan, and the amount allocated to rice shops has been reduced to 5 dan. This small amount is not enough to meet retail sales, and market sentiment remains strong. Moreover, the rainy weather has not stopped, and the amount of goods arriving is very small. The initial market price outside the market once rose to 2.15 million, and the price of thin rice once reached 2.1 million (not high-quality goods). Later, it was heard that the authorities restricted retail sales to no more than 1.98 million, and the black market for rice became difficult, so it became soft. White japonica rice returned to 2.1 million, and thin rice and Yangxian rice fell to 2.05 million, but still 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Yesterday, the total amount of goods arriving in the two markets, including allocated rice, was 13,206 dan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The price of flour fell sharply and rapidly, and market conditions fluctuated greatly, indicating a strong speculative atmosphere. Initially, due to the rise in rice prices and the rise in wheat prices to 1,182,000 yuan, the rising trend spread. The opening price of Lao Che flour was 940,000, the opening price of Bingchuan flour was 920,000, and major brokers sold at high prices, and the market went straight down. The closing price of Lao Che flour was 890,000, the closing price of Bingchuan flour was 870,000, and the closing price of Hong Feng flour was 860,000. Except for Lao Che flour, which rose by 5,000, the rest were flat. The price of bran rebounded, with large bran at 520,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Prices rose and fell unevenly. Soybeans tended to soften, and corn rose steadily, jumping 200,000 yuan. Red beans rose by more than 100,000 yuan. Sesame was scarce, and sellers pushed up prices. Mung beans were bought by Qingdao brokers and local brokers, and the price rose rapidly by more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil Turned flat. Soybean oil rose again at the closing. Yesterday's opening price was still very weak. Because the second phase of household oil was about to begin, local brokers were very lax, and because the rising trend of soybeans had weakened slightly, market sentiment had turned weak. Soybean cake was flat and weak, and trading was inactive.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Firm</h3>
<p>Since the end of the Lunar New Year holiday, all industries have resumed normal operations. However, the tea market remains quiet, with the export tea price being higher domestically than internationally. As for domestic flower teas, the sales of local and guest brokers remain the same, and buying interest is still growing strongly. However, sellers insist that production and inventory are empty, and are stimulated by the rising prices of all goods. Therefore, the mentality is getting better and prices are rising aggressively. Until the closing, the market prices soared, but the negotiations between the two parties were difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion, so there was no trading success.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Taiwan Sugar Exports to Japan Resolved</h3>
<p>Allied Headquarters Dispatches Ships to Kaohsiung for Loading</p>
<p>The long-pending issue of exporting Taiwan sugar to Japan has recently been resolved. It is reported that Allied Headquarters has officially telegraphed the Central Trust of China in Taiwan and dispatched the Japanese ship "Nissho Maru" directly to Kaohsiung on the 14th. It is expected to arrive on the 18th and load 5,000 to 6,000 tons of Taiwan sugar for return to Japan.</p>
<p>This shipment of Taiwan sugar to Japan is the largest since the victory and the first batch of the total of 25,000 tons contracted by the Central Trust Bureau with Allied Headquarters in March of last year at a price of US$200 per ton. It is also learned that all shipments can be completed before the end of May. The reasons for the delay in loading were firstly, the gradual decline in world sugar prices after the contract was signed, which led Allied Headquarters to take a wait-and-see attitude. Secondly, the Chinese Shipowners' Association, in order to maintain navigation rights, once opposed the use of Japanese ships for transport. However, based on the contract's stipulation of (F.O.B.) delivery at Taiwan docks, a compromise had to be adopted.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Trust Company Adds Xinjiang Remittance Services</h3>
<p>Xinjiang Province, located in a remote border region, has historically been isolated from the mainland due to geographical and other environmental limitations. Since the government began promoting its development, the region's commerce has gradually flourished. However, this city lacks commercial financial institutions to facilitate the exchange of funds with the region. It is now learned that the Shanghai Trust Company, in order to cooperate with national policy and invigorate the economies of both regions, will begin offering Xinjiang Province remittance services effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Relaxation of Limits on Gold and Cash Carried by Returning Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 18th] The Xiamen Customs has recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to relax the limits on gold and cash carried by returning overseas Chinese.

If the deadline is exceeded, customs will send the excess amount to the Central Bank for exchange into national currency at the market rate, which will be returned upon presentation of the custody certificate.</p>
<h3>Rayon Continues to Rise, Mills Manage to Hold Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market opened flat but rose sharply, ending the day RMB 7 million higher than the previous day. No. 120 Asahi and Golden Three Horses bright rayon opened at RMB 98 million in the morning. As silk mills were about to resume operations, actual sales showed a slight improvement, and asking prices frequently rose. The market closed at RMB 100.15 million at noon. The afternoon saw further gains, with a closing asking price of RMB 6 million being offered, but the off-exchange price fell to RMB 5 million. Tianqiao and Toyo followed suit with ups and downs.</p>

<h3>Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices Adjusted Again, 20-count Yarn Rises Another RMB 2 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee again adjusted the negotiated cotton yarn prices yesterday. The new price for 20-count yarn is RMB 42 million, an increase of RMB 2 million, or 5%. The committee continued to entrust the China Textile Construction Corporation to open for sale 18 kinds of yarn at the Yarn Trade Association yesterday, selling approximately 2,000 bales in total. The prices and purchase permits will be revealed this morning.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Corporation also opened for sale 15 kinds of yarn as usual yesterday, selling 1,177 bales, equivalent to 2,093 bales of 20-count yarn, with a total of 427 applications.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Prices Soar</p>
<p>In other news, despite the supply offered by the China Textile Construction Corporation yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw tight restrictions placed on applications from fellow traders, leading to a shortage of available yarn. Furthermore, it was heard that Qingdao yarn prices had soared, and a major dealer from the Guangdong faction seized the opportunity to profit, tightening credit conditions in the market both overtly and covertly. Outside buying pressure remained strong, and actual sales to both local and outside customers were brisk. Demand exceeded supply, and the market saw a uniform surge in prices.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped RMB 2.8 million at the opening, reaching RMB 72 million. Asking prices rose even higher, reaching a peak of RMB 78.5 million. Although the China Textile Construction Corporation offered additional supply near the close, the market remained bullish due to high confidence. The market then saw a slight pullback as traders from the Taiwan faction took profits, but the market still closed at RMB 78.2 million, a significant increase of RMB 8 million from the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also continued to rise, ranging from RMB 2 million to RMB 6-7 million, but most have increased by 20% to 40% compared to the end of the lunar year.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with reports of potential US loans, causing some market participants to waver and smaller traders to sell out of fear, softening the market. However, traders from the Hankou and Northern factions seized the opportunity to buy aggressively, and the Xi'an faction also came in to absorb supply. Dyeing factories, due to brisk actual sales of raw cloth and Shilin cloth, and with raw material yarn prices soaring and the China Textile Construction Corporation not increasing the allocated quantity (with each household only receiving twenty-odd bolts of high-quality cloth in the last period, and prices also high), resulted in twelve-pound high-quality and other fine cloths continuing to rise by RMB 85,000 to RMB 100,000. The markets for other fabrics, such as four-gentlemen serge, straight tribute, bleached cloth, twill cloth, and Shilin cloth, also advanced uniformly, by around RMB 50,000 to RMB 100,000.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw remarkably high confidence. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere became even more brisk due to soaring cotton yarn prices. Many smaller players sold at high prices, and trading was active. Prices across all grades rose in unison, increasing by RMB 700,000 to RMB 1 million. 710 bales were traded. Factory delivery prices for Han fine cotton opened at RMB 7.936 million, warehouse delivery prices for Han fine cotton opened at RMB 7.605 million to RMB 7.84 million, Han coarse cotton at RMB 6.448 million, Shashi cotton at RMB 8.39 million to RMB 8.66 million, Tuolisi cotton at RMB 8.267 million, Zhangde cotton at RMB 7.853 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton at RMB 1.82 million, up RMB 120,000.</p>
<p>Silk Yarn and Textiles Rise Across the Board</p>
<p>Silk yarn and finished textile products such as down yarn, lining silk, floral cloth, rainproof cloth, white canvas, hemp-rubber cloth, French lining, and gray soft lining all rose yesterday. This was because the prices of raw silk and yarn soared, pushing up costs, and manufacturers raised prices firmly, resulting in uniform increases. Over 200 bolts of silk-gloss down yarn were traded yesterday, with No. 1 priced at RMB 95,000 per yard, No. 2 at RMB 82,500, No. 3 at RMB 70,000, and No. 4 at RMB 64,000.

<h3>The Quantity of Salt for Export is Yet to be Decided</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Central Trust Bureau's barter trade with Japan, edible salt has traditionally been a major export item. This year, the bureau had planned to ship salt to Japan early, but according to the Salt Administration, the situation in North China is unstable, transportation is not smooth, and the output and transportation from various production areas cannot be predicted. Therefore, the quantity of salt for export cannot be determined at this time. The quantity requested by the Central Trust Bureau will also need to be approved at a later date.</p>

<h3>Prosperity or Destruction</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>— After Reading [Atomic Energy, the Universe, and Life]</p>
<p>By G. Gamow, Translated by Chen Zhongjie and Shu Chongze, Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a pessimistic philosopher who wrote a story: A omnipotent master designed a beautiful and complete garden and gave it to a group of children to play in. At first, they were well-behaved, wholeheartedly enjoying and appreciating it. Gradually, they began to quarrel, and then attempted to use many means to rob and occupy each other, forgetting the joy of enjoyment. All day long, they screamed, fought, and exhausted every means to attack each other, until they discovered fire, a terrible weapon. In one of their conflicts, they set fire to each other, ultimately destroying this magnificent garden and ending the lives of these restless beings. This is a fable, and telling it today has an extremely profound meaning. Since humans began to struggle, they controlled water, then tamed fire, step by step venturing into the mysteries of the universe, and finally grasping the source of all this energy – atomic energy. This is a great discovery, bringing both good news and bad news to humanity. Prosperity or destruction; two paths are clearly laid out for humanity to quickly choose using their wisdom.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution brought new impetus to mankind, and also brought new encounters. The rapid development left some social scientists unable to address these new encounters in time. Overproduction, labor issues, colonial issues; a series of unpleasant events followed one another for the better part of a century. Today, this terrible thing has come again. Social scientists cannot keep pace with natural scientists. When hatred, quarrels, and wars are spreading everywhere, they bring something containing danger. With the slightest mistake, it is a great fire that can burn this magnificent garden to utter destruction. Politicians must run quickly, because the distance between you and the scientists is too great.</p>
<p>People often use the phrase "atomic age," but what kind of age is this? What is its core meaning? We believe that most people's concepts are very vague, especially in China, where science is still lagging behind, and understanding of it is even more pitiful. Therefore, we specially introduce a book discussing all issues related to atomic energy to readers. As the author said in his preface: "This book will provide a complete and coherent description of the atomic energy issue and will answer the questions: What is it? Where does it come from? And how can it be used wisely?" The author, G. Gamow, is a physics professor at the University of Washington. His outstanding achievements in nuclear physics qualify him to discuss these issues. Moreover, Professor Gamow is quite humorous. When discussing many solemn and profound issues, he always loves to use extremely vivid examples to make metaphors, greatly helping you in your understanding. And those interesting illustrations make a deeper impression on you. Recently, there have been quite a few books introduced in China on issues such as atomic energy, but most fall into two categories. One category is purely academic discussions, which, except for a few people with an excellent foundation in modern physics, most people dare not touch. The other category is irresponsible nonsense, which will only confuse your concepts after reading. This is the first book that uses a very cordial tone by an authoritative scholar to discuss this issue. He presented the greatness and danger of atomic energy to people, pointed out two paths for readers to choose—prosperity and destruction—and also built his grand vision.</p>
<p>From the discovery by French physicist Henri Becquerel in 1896 that a piece of uranium ore placed in a drawer could darken a nearby package of dry photographic plates, he has always talked about the atomic bomb explosion in Japan, and then further depicts a beautiful vision of how people will use the great energy to improve their lives; A rocket launcher stores one hundred pounds of fuel, going to the moon and other planets. But he says there is a premise; scientists all over the world must cooperate and concentrate their efforts to promote development, and politicians must cooperate to eliminate wars and transfer the efforts engaged in atomic bomb manufacturing competition to atomic energy utilization.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into three major chapters. The first chapter answers what atomic energy is. Professor Gamow starts with basic chemistry and uses new principles to explain many chemical changes we already know; and reveals all the internal secrets of the atomic nucleus. In our chemical elements, except for silver, all others are restless, so-called in a "metastable state." As long as there is an appropriate object to impact, nuclear fission and fusion will occur, and this occurrence is accompanied by huge energy. Therefore, Professor Gamow issued a warning: "We are actually living in an unpredictable powder keg, where all the substances, whether a glass of water or a piece of bread, are equipped with terrible amounts of energy, waiting for the opportunity to be released."</p>
<p>All the energy on Earth comes from the sun's radiation, but where does the sun's energy come from? It turns out that this is also atomic energy. Using this new theory, many astronomical problems can be answered, and even the theory of the origin of the universe can be found. The last chapter is also the most important chapter. In addition to telling how the atomic bomb has great destructive power, the author predicts that future atomic bombs will be even more destructive. An atomic bomb thrown into the sea can throw warships thousands of feet into the air, destroying each other. However, if atomic energy is used to serve mankind, it will be a more powerful servant. Finally, he appealed to mankind in a tone of prayer, "We are born in the most proud era, but our responsibilities are too great. The prosperity and complete destruction of mankind are all in our hands. Use the highest wisdom?"……『We hope that the best major success of atomic energy will be planetary exploration, not human destruction.』</p>
<h3>Reading [Dongfang Bai]</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>—Report of the American Educational Mission to Japan—</p>
<p>Translated by Zheng Xiaocang, First Edition by Commercial Press, November 1947</p>
<p>Since Japan's defeat, the Allied Powers, in addition to military occupation and disarming them, have also assisted the newly emerging Japan in its efforts to reform in politics, economy, education, and culture, hoping that a democratic Japan can be established as soon as possible to lay the foundation for maintaining world peace. In particular, the reform of Japanese education is of great concern to peace-loving people. Education is the foundation of a democratic society and is closely related to the entire nation-state and even the world. All enlightened people should know that the growth of Japanese militarist ideology is closely related to the military-national education they implemented in the past. In a sense, Japan's past education can be said to have been "successful," and that success is manifested in their various forms of aggression, in the so-called "building a new order in East Asia" and "establishing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." If we want to thoroughly eliminate Japan's narrow militarist ideology of the past and eradicate their narrow feudal consciousness and aggressive concepts, it is not enough to simply disarm them. The most important thing is to rebuild the Japanese education system to cleanse all cultural toxins that endanger humanity.</p>
<p>In the year after General MacArthur garrisoned Japan, in order to reform Japanese education, he requested the US military department to ask the State Department to send more than 20 educational experts to Japan for on-site investigation. After repeated observation and consideration by experts, the "Report of the American Educational Mission to Japan" put forward many valuable opinions on the reform of Japanese education. Professor Zheng Xiaocang translated it into Chinese and titled it "Dongfang Bai" (Eastern White). From this book, we seem to see the dawn of a new civilization in East Asia gradually emerging.</p>
<p>This report is likely to have a great impact on Japanese education, culture, and political thought. The theoretical part can not only serve as a reference for the implementation of Japanese education, but also inspire the path of educational research. China and Japan have the closest relationship, and China has suffered the greatest trial in this war. While caressing the painful experience, we cannot but be concerned about their educational reforms. Since China is in the ranks of the Allied Powers, it naturally has the task of eliminating their militarist ideas, so we have to pay attention to the points on Japanese education reform suggested by our allies. In addition, American educational theories and methods still dominate the world. China's past education system has been greatly influenced by the United States. After the war, the relationship between China and the United States became closer and closer, and it is necessary to promote the exchange of education, culture, and thought between the two countries. From this report, we can also see the American education system and its fundamental spirit, and we can also see a concise explanation of American education.</p>
<p>The report is divided into six chapters, emphasizing both facts and opinions. The first chapter, "The Purpose and Content of Japanese Education," elaborates on the defects of Japanese education in the past. The excessive concentration of educational administrative power has made Japanese education tend towards nationalism and militarism, and it is monopolized by bureaucratic politicians. If we want to reform the current Japanese education, we must give teachers the greatest freedom. Knowledge education should be re-evaluated for its value, the curriculum should not only be a fixed knowledge, teaching should not only be limited to the designated textbooks, and rigid examinations can never measure all the activities of a student's physical and mental development. Students have different personalities and talents, and it is important not to neglect teaching students according to their aptitude. The "self-cultivation" course tends to foster obedience and must be infiltrated with the qualities of a free life to cultivate democratic ideals and egalitarian concepts among children and young people. Broad moral training should be carried out in school activities containing democratic ideas. The myths in history and geography textbooks should be deleted, and local teaching materials should be used more in primary schools; senior schools should promote objective research in various ways. Teaching should not be forced to accept, but should cultivate students' reading attitude of careful questioning and clear discernment. The book also makes recommendations for the promotion of health education and physical education courses. It also mentions the scientific and artistic nature of vocational education; and the need to give play to the creative spirit of "social research" teaching.</p>
<p>The second chapter, "Writing Reform," contains many insightful studies by the mission, which believes that the reform movement of Japanese writing has reached its time. The members of the mission suggest using the Roman alphabet phonetic spelling method, but it needs to be researched and reformed in a planned manner. They advocate the establishment of a language committee, which will be responsible for liaison and research on writing reform during the transition period, and to formulate plans to introduce the Roman alphabet phonetic system into schools and gradually promote it in society. In addition, Japanese spoken language is more complex and should be simplified.</p>
<p>The third chapter, "Educational Facilities in the Elementary and Secondary Stages," suggests the reform of school administration in view of the spirit of democratic education. The change should be from centralized power to decentralized power, and educational management institutions should be established at the municipal and prefectural levels, and personnel should be elected by the people. These institutions should have the power to supervise schools, examine teachers, and compile textbooks. These powers were previously managed by the Ministry of Education. In the future, the Ministry of Education can be in a guiding and auxiliary position and does not need to directly control local education. Compulsory education should be increased to nine years, for boys and girls up to the age of sixteen, and tuition should be free. The first six years are primary school, and the next three years are junior high school. Junior high school provides general education and is available to everyone. The curriculum must be flexible and take into account vocational preparation. The above should be a three-year high school, free of tuition, and must be co-educational. Private schools should still enjoy the freedom they deserve as long as they meet the minimum standards.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, "Education and Teacher Education," gives Japanese educators a new ideal. In the past, teaching methods focused on memory, obedience, and the ideas of the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues, which should be changed. In the future, students' independent thinking, personality development, and understanding of the rights and obligations of democratic citizens should be encouraged. Moral teaching is mainly based on precepts and maxims, which is bound to be ineffective and must be based on experience gained from the specific context of schools and society. The mission hopes that all current teachers will be able to obtain "re-education" opportunities. Normal schools should be reformed to enable future teachers to implement the ideals of democracy. They believe that the current pre-education course for normal schools should be abolished, the purpose is nothing more than to improve the level and strengthen professional training. The professional education of school administrators and supervisors is as important as that of teachers. Universities and other senior schools should provide teachers and administrative personnel with various opportunities for in-depth research.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter, "Adult Education," emphasizes the importance of adult education in the new Japan. It advocates that schools at all levels should be open to the general public. In addition, central libraries and their branches should be set up in large cities, and such facilities should also be available in each prefecture. If the Ministry of Education can set up a public library management department, it can expand the effectiveness of adult education. The educational effect of museums of science, art, and industry is the same as that of libraries. As for various local or professional societies, labor groups, and political groups, they can also be made to exert educational power and educate the broad masses of the people.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter, "Higher Education," expounds the cultural and social significance of higher education. Universities and colleges should enrich their content and provide students with the convenience of studying natural, social, artistic, and humanistic subjects, and promote a free atmosphere of academic and thought. In the past, Japanese higher education was only the privilege of a few people, and this malady should be corrected in the future. The members of the mission advocate that higher education should be allowed to develop freely without being overly controlled, at most supervised and assisted. Assistance should be given to young men and women with talent but without the ability to enter school. It is also suggested to expand libraries and other research equipment and research institutes. In order to establish academic freedom and economic security for professors, it is advocated to abolish the current civil service system.</p>
<p>Although the content described in this report is a plan to reform Japanese education, it has actually implemented the new ideals of democratic politics and the new views of liberalism. The American education experts' in-depth analysis of the Japanese educational tradition can certainly give us a reference for educational research; and their insightful suggestions better express the lofty ideals of democratic education and the true spirit of free thought. We should appreciate these words of General MacArthur: "The educational reform implemented by the Japanese people will eventually enable them to deeply understand the place of a country in the world, and it will promote world peace and protect various human rights." Yes, for defeated Japan, for the Japan that is being restored, their people should be educated with a sound outlook on life, society, and the world. Undoubtedly, the entire educational foundation must be placed on democracy. This is the main trend of American educational thought, the trend of the educational culture of the emerging Japan, and the ultimate goal of world educational ideals. Many experts here have pointed out that the focus of Japanese education reform is on freedom of thought and equal educational opportunities, which happens to be a new path for education that is a new path from militarism. China, which is beginning to implement a constitution, should naturally also draw some ideals of democratic education. Looking at this report with such an eye, it should not be of no help to oneself, right?</p>
<h3>"Pride and Prejudice"</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</p>
<p>"Pride and Prejudice" is a timeless English novel that has been popular in our country for a long time.</p>
<p>The author, Austen, is a writer famous for depicting everyday family life. She was born in 1775 in Hampshire, England. Her father was a local church pastor, and her mother was the niece of a famous satirist. Austen had seven siblings. Throughout her life, she never left her warm and lively family, remaining unmarried and living a peaceful life at home with her family. After finishing trivial household chores or during after-meal breaks, she would write, and the content of her works was almost entirely based on family life. In 1797, at the young age of twenty-two, she wrote "Pride and Prejudice," but it was not published until fourteen years later. She has several other well-known novels, but "Pride and Prejudice" is her most famous representative work.</p>
<p>Austen was not widely recognized during her lifetime, but after her death in 1817, she was greatly praised by writers and readers. Literary critic G.H. Lewes said, "Austen's purpose is to express social life, and she does it just right." Essayist Macaulay said, "She is closer to Shakespeare than any other writer." Walter Scott said, "Her vivid descriptions and genuine emotions make ordinary and trivial matters and ordinary characters very interesting. I myself cannot catch up with her." From these comments, we can already understand the value of Austen's works.</p>
<p>The story of "Pride and Prejudice" depicts the daily life of the Bennet family, a rural gentleman's family, and the love and marriage of his two daughters and two young men who moved from England to the countryside to stay. The story is so meaningful and realistic; the things happening in the Longbourn estate seem like they just happened in our own homes yesterday. We can see it anytime, or we often hear family members talking about such things in family conversations. The author writes every character's actions, habits, and speech without any exaggeration or excessive embellishment. When we read this book, we feel like we are part of the Bennet family or friends of Darcy, closely connected with them. This is the author's greatest success.</p>
<p>Darcy, the male protagonist in the book, is from a noble family. He values the concept of noble lineage. His family has an annual income of ten thousand pounds, and he is accustomed to the bustling life of the city. In his character, a kind of arrogance naturally appears, and his face often reveals a solemn attitude of looking down on others. He is most intolerant of the vulgarity and crudeness often found in the lower classes. However, he also has his merits, as he is happy to help those who have the same status as him. The female protagonist, Elizabeth, is the daughter of a country gentleman, with the natural temperament of the countryside. However, she is intelligent and quick-witted. Although she cannot reach the high ranks of the noble class, her strength and loveliness are even more evident in her humility, maintaining her prejudice and never flattering or bowing to others.</p>
<p>The meeting of Darcy and Elizabeth marks the beginning of the confrontation between pride and prejudice. Only through practical experience in real life can pride and prejudice be eliminated. Therefore, the author allows Darcy and Elizabeth to receive lessons from life's realities. After several trials of separation, reunion, joy, and sorrow, they cannot help but sincerely abandon the bad habits created by the social environment. Finally, they are able to be happily united. This is the understanding that Austen's talented and fluent writing inspires and suggests to us. This is particularly worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Because of Darcy's arrogance, Elizabeth's prejudice is further strengthened. Now, let's look at Elizabeth's words to Darcy at the end of the book: "I often have irresistible painful memories intruding into my mind... Although I have never held selfish views, my behavior has been selfish throughout my life. When I was young, adults told me what was right, but they didn't tell me to correct my temper. Although I held good views, they all let me learn their pride and conceit. As an only son, I was unfortunately spoiled by my parents. My parents themselves are good, but they indulged me, encouraging me to be almost selfish and arrogant, caring for no one except my family; seeing everyone else as inferior, at least thinking their knowledge and value were not as good as mine. From eight to twenty-eight, that's how I was. If it weren't for you, my dearest, most beloved Elizabeth, I might still be like that! What don't I owe to you? You gave me a lesson, although it was not easy to accept at first, but it was very beneficial. You have taught me to be able to properly depreciate myself. I came to you then confident that you would accept me. You also taught me how unworthy my extravagance was to move a woman worthy of flattery."</p>
<p>This is Darcy's self-confession, and I think it should also paint a clear portrait for many young intellectuals today. Today, among the sons of noble families, I wonder how many still carry such airs.</p>
<p>Love and marriage only occupy a small part of life's journey. Pride and prejudice are no longer the bridges to healthy love. Looking at it from other perspectives of life, pride and prejudice are also things that must be eliminated. I think Austen, through her moving story, not only illustrates that pride and prejudice cannot exist in the midst of love, but also directs readers to be equally vigilant in other endeavors.</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese scholars who study English literature criticism have especially praised this book "Pride and Prejudice" because the original text is simple, and the sentences are delicate, fluent, and easy to understand, making it very suitable for people learning English to read carefully. Therefore, many middle schools use this book as an English textbook. There was a Chinese translation a long time ago by Miss Yang Bin, a student in the Department of Foreign Languages at Yenching University. Although the translation is quite faithful, it is far from the exquisite structure and tactful tone of the original work. We hope that better new Chinese translations will be published soon. It is naturally very necessary to publish one or two more translations of a famous work. Here, we express our sincere hopes to translators!</p>

<h3>My Used Bookstore</h3>
<p>— Mao Ren</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I would go to the movies whenever I had free time, but now I run to used bookstores whenever I have free time because I feel that buying used books is more economical than going to the movies. Although some people with so-called scientific knowledge warn us that old books inevitably contain germs and it's better not to look at them, I feel that the world is so big and there are so many germs, there are opportunities to run into them everywhere, so why avoid them specifically when it comes to old books. The reasons for going to used bookstores are, first, to get books I want at a lower price, and second, to discover rare books that I have long heard of but never had the chance to see. There are ways to achieve the former without relying solely on used bookstores; foreign cheap editions are probably aimed at meeting the needs of poor scholars. This faces difficulties in China that do not exist abroad: first, the sales of books are not high, and the original publishers still can't sell many copies, so how many readers will buy cheap editions; second, the reason why foreign cheap editions can be cheap is that I think half of it is saved on paper and given to readers, for example, if the original edition uses thick (I don't know what it's called) good paper, the cheap edition uses thin newspaper, but in China, newspaper is used from the start, so there's already nothing more to save; third, are Chinese publishers willing to let others release cheap editions of their good books that have sold several editions in a regular way (i.e., pay publishing taxes or other fees), as there's no precedent to follow. But despite these difficulties, I still want to make an effort to try...</p>
<p>Let's talk about my used bookstore, which I will try sooner or later. The unpleasant thing about ordinary used bookstores is the "unpleasant demeanor" of the owners or employees; they don't seem to welcome people who come to look at or even buy books. This may be due to their own difficulties; prices are rising every day, and a book that can be sold for 100,000 tomorrow is only worth 80,000 or 90,000 today, which is giving the customer a discount. Although there is always a tomorrow after tomorrow, the only way to make a full profit is to hide it in the mountains. But I am there to look at and buy books, not to look at their faces, so as soon as I enter, I focus my eyes on the books on the shelves, and even when bargaining after picking one, I still don't look around, so the "unpleasant demeanor" is still manageable. It's only during bargaining that I feel indignant. There have been several times when the books were not rare editions, but the prices were almost as high as new books, or only one or two tenths cheaper, but it's useless to say more to them; who told you to want to buy it? Also, it may take them three or five years to sell a book they bought, so how can they do without making a few more bucks?</p>
<p>What I find most unbearable is the "bargaining down" in used bookstores. I often see women and children coming to sell one or two packages of books, with ashamed expressions, and as a result, they are bargained down to selling mutton as dog meat. Once the books are in their hands, the dog meat immediately turns into mutton. With each transaction, they make a huge profit. But seeking more profit is the common commercial ethic in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, so how can we blame only used bookstores?</p>
<p>That's why I want to open a used bookstore. The books are still old books, but I want to try a new way of doing business. For example, there is a fixed price for selling and buying. For example, if a new book sells for 100,000, I give the seller half price when I buy it, and then sell it at 70% of the new book price. Doing this is of course still profitable for me, but it's considered a little fairer, and what's even better is that both the seller and the buyer of used books have a basis for the price, so there's no need for one to ask for the sky and the other to bargain to the ground. In addition, I would often post advertisements to let customers know what books they love are for sale, so they don't have to bother coming often, which is also a convenient way for those who buy from used bookstores.</p>
<p>I am looking for a shop everywhere, but the "transfer fees" are all counted in ounces or taels of gold, so it's not possible to realize it for the moment. Then let's wait for the auspicious day to open when the rent is paid in books.</p>
<h3>Visiting Xiang Yu's Hometown</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>When I was young and full of energy, I read "The Biography of Xiang Yu," and with the addition of novels and dramas, I developed a fondness for this West Chu overlord who dominated the world and whose heroic spirit could not be surpassed in ten generations. Regardless of his merits, demerits, successes, or failures, he was always a remarkable figure. Sinking boats and breaking cauldrons, and committing suicide by the Wujiang River fully demonstrated his heroic nature.</p>
<p>Recently, with a rare opportunity, I was able to go to Xiang Yu's hometown and wanted to find some relics that were slightly more realistic than what I read in books. The location is a small village surrounded by mountains more than thirty li southwest of Yuecheng. The village is called Xiangli, and the population is not large. The villagers are simple and honest, and in addition to farming, many are engaged in the tin foil industry. The scenery and terrain are majestic and beautiful.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of an acquaintance, I stepped into the "Xiang Yu Temple" (the only remaining relic of Xiang Yu in the entire village), which is a row of five temple halls. The pillars are not connected, and the beams do not touch. There are also five halls, and in each hall sits a statue of Xiang Yu and Lady Yu Ji. The statues are not large, and Xiang Yu's appearance is far from the imposing figure on the stage. Why build it like this? Because the village is divided into five communities, each community governs itself, competing with each other, and unable to agree, so they built it this way. This alone has some of Xiang Yu's stubbornness.</p>
<p>I wanted to find some inscriptions in the temple for research materials, but not only was it impossible, but there were not even steles describing the history and evolution; the few plaques were all of the "Blessing One Side" and "Answering All Requests" variety. If Xiang Yu really performed the duties of a local god here, it could be said that his heroic spirit was cut short!</p>
<p>I went to a small tea shop to interview an old farmer, and all I got were some half-hour, half-fabricated myths, which made people not believe that Xiang Yu was a real person. An old man enthusiastically took me to the stream in the valley and showed me a large piece of rock at the bottom of the stream with knife marks.</p>
<p>He said, "This is where Jin Wuzhu forced Little Kang Wang to come, and he washed his spear in the stream. The blood on the spear stained the rock red, and these cracks were carved by the tip of the spear. Xiang Wang resisted here for a while, and Little Kang Wang was able to escape."</p>
<p>"They weren't contemporaries, were they?" I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"Of course it was Xiang Wang showing his divinity!" He turned and left unhappily. I felt very indifferent and disappointed and then left this beautiful mountain village.</p>
<h3>Wordless Spring Couplets</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, Chen Hongmou, after studying and retiring to the countryside, often gathered with the elders of the village for entertainment. A few days before the New Year, many villagers asked him for Spring Festival couplets. Chen smiled and accepted the requests, ordering his family members to write marks on the back of the paper. However, he never wrote a single word, nor did he order his scribes to do it for him. When the time came for the villagers to collect the couplets, Hongmou returned the old paper to them. The villagers were greatly surprised and asked: Why not write words? Chen said, "It is better to have no word (matter) than to have word (matter)." The villagers happily took them home and pasted them on their doors. Someone asked: Why are there no words? The villagers said: "Lord Chen said: It is better to have no word than to have word, so we don't use words." Chen heard this and laughed loudly. Later, this became a custom, and to this day, many Spring Festival couplets in Guangxi are pasted on red paper without writing words. (See Xiaoshemeiguan Cuolu)</p>
<h3>Chess Talk</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>To those who don't play chess, chess seems boring. It requires concentration and years of research. Indeed, the Sanskrit words for "chess game" translate to "game of wisdom" – and becoming a chess expert does require a lot of research. However, it is a fact that anyone with ordinary intelligence can quickly learn the basics of chess. Many eight- or nine-year-olds play chess, and it is common for fathers and sons to clash across the chessboard.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of chess, it is generally believed to have originated in India. Some historians say there were chess pieces as early as 3000 BC, and objects similar to chessboards have been found in Egyptian tombs. These objects may have been used for some form of chess game, but the more likely origin of chess is from a dice game. Our most reliable records indicate that chess pieces were truly invented in India around 700 AD. Although early chess used dice to determine the movement of pieces, to date, playing chess relies entirely on intelligence and has nothing to do with luck.</p>
<p>Chess was introduced to Europe around the ninth century, probably by sailors who first introduced it to Spain or Portugal, and then spread it from there. At first, people generally viewed it with suspicion, especially figures in the church. One record says that in 1060 AD, the Bishop of Florence strictly prohibited playing chess in hotels. If anyone committed this "sin," they would be punished by "washing the feet of twelve poor people." This prohibition may have been caused by the fact that playing chess was often associated with gambling. Indian chess players would bet a hand or a leg on a game of chess. They would keep a pot of boiling liquid at hand, and if a chess player lost a finger, he would quickly chop it off, cauterize the stump, and continue playing chess – another strange bet is described in a fourteenth-century legend – the loser had to drink all the salt water in the sea. However, the loser was a clever fellow. He demanded that the winner first drink all the fresh water in the sea, and as a result, he was able to get away with it.</p>
<p>By the end of the thirteenth century, all oppression against chess had disappeared, and playing chess became a favorite pastime of the upper class. Warriors, nobles, poets, and even monks played chess whenever they had the opportunity. Noble ladies also played chess, and chess was considered a useful tool for courting women – especially for shy men who were not good at speaking. However, playing chess between men and women was not always harmonious. For example, when the Countess of Flanders won a chess game against her husband, he was so ashamed and angry that he punched her! Later, he was captured in war, and she refused to pay the ransom in revenge, which resulted in him being a prisoner for thirteen years.</p>
<p>Beautiful and valuable chess sets can add to the enjoyment of playing chess. Many museums display chess pieces carved from jade, ivory, crystal, amber, ebony, and other precious materials. The figures and flowers carved on them are often exquisite and delightful.</p>
<p>Chess was most popular in the Middle Ages, and it can be said to have reached an unprecedented peak. By the end of the fourteenth century, playing cards began to appear and became supplements to chess. In modern times, playing cards has become more popular than chess, largely because card games are faster and the number of participants is not limited to two, so everyone can participate and enjoy themselves. However, chess has not been eliminated by the rise of playing cards, and the reason why chess has been able to exist for thousands of years without being abandoned is mainly because it is a fair game – it is a battle of wits and not a battle of "luck."</p>
<h3>Super Saccharin</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>A Dutch scientist, Professor Van Keide, recently created a new compound that can be called "Super Saccharin." According to Professor Van, this compound is five thousand times sweeter than ordinary table sugar, and he is now planning to manufacture it on a large scale. Professor Van said that the cost of this saccharin is low, and when sold in the future, it will only cost about four US dollars per pound, and each pound will be enough for an average family for ten years. The official name of this new saccharin is L-n-propoxy-a-amino-4-mitrobenaene.</p>
<h3>Faithful Believer</h3>
<p>— Xi Li</p>
<p>In Scotland lived an old woman who firmly believed that prayer was very effective. One night, two young men overheard her praying for bread. These two wanted to have some fun, so they bought two loaves of bread and dropped them into her cottage through the chimney. The next day, they went again to hear how she thanked God in her prayer. When she finished, the two men laughed loudly and she went inside. They told her how they had dropped the bread in through the chimney.</p>
<p>But the old woman's faith was not shaken at all. She firmly said, "Of course the bread was given to me by God. However, she must have sent the little devils to deliver it."</p>
<h3>Hanshan Temple Bell</h3>
<p>— Yu Yifen</p>
<p>When did the bell of Hanshan Temple in Suzhou ring during the Tang Dynasty, I wonder? Wu Jushang (Changchi) wrote in the Bell Chapter of the Hanshan Temple Chronicle: "The Tang Dynasty bell was refined with extraordinary precision, with fantastic and ancient cloud patterns, and flying ridges and valleys that undulate and move, and there are edges to the touch. I have seen rubbings of bells from the Baoshi Temple which all look like this. It is a pity that this temple has been in disrepair for a long time. In the Ming Dynasty, a bell was recast, and it was also locked away, but since Zhang Ji wrote the poem, on moonlit evenings and frosty mornings, there are still lingering sounds. Geng Ling jiaozhu, asking questions and disputes arise again, wrapping it up and recording it, is also a matter of hearing." According to Baicheng Yan Shui, during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the monk Benji built a bell tower, which was melted down to make cannons during the Japanese pirate crisis. Tang Yin's Bell Solicitation states: "The wooden clapper patrols the roads, which is how the Zhou official warned their stubborn and ignorant subjects. The bronze bell controls the morning and evening, which is how the釋氏awakened people's spirits, resolving the battles of the demon kings, resounding in the heavenly palaces above, relieving the sorrows of all living beings, and heard in the hells below. So提尊者 manifested supernatural powers and 外道無言, and Zen Master Benji realized the true words and古德 praised him. It is truly named a Dharma instrument, and its number is 大音. Our temple's number is Hanshan. 建始普明, the temple halls are well-equipped, but the bronze bell has not yet been completed. When the moon sets and crows caw, there is 張繼's line about Maple Bridge, and when thunder drums strike, I am ashamed of Li Bai's inscription made of ashes. Now I will stoke the furnace to melt fine gold, mold clay to cast a great joy, and use this grand event to ask for the wisdom of noble people and increase the grandeur of the mountain gate! May it open a thousand doors to dawn, awakening all latent beings, and pacify myriad households at dusk, and exhaust the dragons. Adorn the Buddha's land, benefit humanity and heaven, increase the light of wisdom, and make the field of fortune not thin. With this solicitation, I look forward to the manifestation of brightness, and the verse says: Outside the Gusu city, in an ancient Zen room, I intend to rust the bronze and inform the four directions. Try to answer, after it is reborn and becomes an instrument, a sound knocks down frost all over the sky." It was made at this time. There was originally a stone inscription in the temple, but it has been blurred over time. Fortunately, the traces are still preserved by the National Palace Museum, and Mr. Wu Hufan personally saw it ten years ago. The name of the talented 6 like, 唐伯虎, is very important. Because of the story of Tang Bohu Pointing Qiu Xiang, the first romantic talent in Jiangnan, it is even more deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary people, so it has been preserved to this day? According to the records, the new bell was cast when Chen Xiaoshi (Kuilong) was governing Wu, and all officials below the fan nie had their names engraved on it.俞曲園's new Hanshan Temple Chronicle contains the words "To the west of the hall, there is still a gap, and a new building is constructed. On this day, the bell tower, cast copper as a bell, hanging it on top, to preserve the ancient relics." The bell that the Japanese pirates stole was not only the old Tang Dynasty thing, but also certainly not 明, which is clear. Chen is now living in seclusion in Shanghai, at the age of ninety-two, and is still healthy. The one who can testify. What is strange is that the Ming bell was destroyed by the Japanese pirates, and the new bell was also taken away by the Japanese pirates. To this day, there is a Japanese bell donated by Hu Xueyan that is confused with the Tang bell, which is unavoidable 閜夾耳.</p>
<p>Zhang Yisun's poem "The bell rings at midnight to the passenger boat" was criticized by Ouyang Xiu, but Tang people such as Bai Letian and Li Yishan have poems with midnight bells. Those who have debated this over the years are many, and Ye's words are 膠柱 詰難 濡起 also. Shilin Poetry Talk says that Zhang Ji wrote a poem about Maple Bridge Temple west of Gusu city. Ouyang once criticized it because it was not the time to ring the bell in the middle of the night, because he had never been to Wuzhong. Now the temples in Wuzhong do ring the bell at midnight. Zhang Ji's poem, thirty餘篇, I have them at my home, often with many excellent sentences. The world thinks that 懿孫 relied on this one poem about resting at Maple Bridge at night to leave his name for thousands of years, seeing this know it is also not so.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Self-Sacrifice (74)</p>
<p>Little Wang's mother said: "There's no use in being anxious. It's so late, and the rain outside is so heavy. Mr. Xu, you can't go back. Please rest here first! There are beds in the outer room, which are prepared for guests. Mr. Xu, please rest, okay?" Zhu Zhai thought for a while, and without news of Qi Wan, he wouldn't feel at ease even if he went back. It would be better to wait here. He nodded and said, "That's fine." After saying that, he wanted to stand up, but as soon as he stretched his waist, a tendon in his left waist felt like it had snapped, and he was in great pain, repeatedly exclaiming, "Aiyo!" He sat down again. Little Wang's mother repeatedly asked, "What's wrong?" She hurried over, helped him up, and slowly helped him into the room, helped him take off his clothes, and covered him with a quilt. She sat on the edge of the bed and massaged Zhu Zhai's left waist through the quilt with her hands. The massage made the pain a little better, and he closed his eyes, letting her massage. After a while, he heard Little Wang's mother asking, "Are you feeling better?" Zhu Zhai only replied, "Thank you for your trouble. Take a break!" Little Wang's mother said, "No, I'm not tired at all. Anyway, the boss isn't coming back, so I can't sleep. Mr. Xu, sleep soundly. After a sleep, the pain in your body will be gone." Zhu Zhai repeatedly agreed and closed his eyes again. After a long time, he felt that Little Wang's mother was still massaging him. He opened his eyes and saw that Little Wang's mother had taken off her shoes and was sitting on the edge of the bed with her legs crossed. Her small face and tender white skin seemed to be dyed with rouge, especially the corners of her eyebrows and eyes, which were particularly bright red. Seeing Zhu Zhai open his eyes, she smiled at him slightly and asked, "You're still not asleep? Are you feeling better now?" Zhu Zhai was very touched by her gentleness and said, "You're too tired. Take a break! I feel much better after your massage." Little Wang's mother said, "If you can feel a little relaxed, I'll massage you a little more." Zhu Zhai stretched out his hand and pressed her hand, feeling that her soft hand was no less than Qi Wan's. Little Wang's mother's hand was pressed by Zhu Zhai, not allowing her to massage. She said, "I'm not tired at all."</p>
