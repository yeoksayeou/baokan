<h3>軍事援華細則擬就　物資採購即可開始　顧維鈞訪問美國務卿馬歇爾長談　提出清單促請及早裝運</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕陳副院長立夫，本日午後由顧維鈞大使陪同，作禮節上之訪問，與馬歇爾會晤於國務院，在歷一小時會談中，兩氏曾與馬卿談及美國之一億二千五百萬美元軍事援華計劃，兩氏並曾促請及早運送軍事物資赴華。顧大使吿記者稱：該項計劃所遵循之細則，已大體擬就，而物資之採購即可開始。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞，昨在國務院與馬歇爾會談歷一小時，要求馬氏協助從速依照一億二千五百萬元軍事援華法案裝運軍火支持中國軍隊，據頭氏事後宣稱：美國預算管理制度雖甚周密，但中國需要援助不容稽延。中國要求詳情如何，顧氏未予說明，亦不願預測開始實行裝遝之時期，僅稱：中國政府已在兩個月前提出軍事需要之首批淸單。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕工商部息：美國爲統制輸出，公平分配出口配額，函請我國塡送本年七月至明年六月我國所需各種自美購置物料需要量，美方所送出口配額商品淸單，計有木材，鋼鐵，石油，化學品，非鐵金屬，運輸器材，建築材料及雜項等八類，除建築材料及雜項（包括臘及裝牛乳用空罐等之類）目前尙無需要外，其餘各項均合我國需要。本案所須塡送之需要量等表件，已由工商部根據各政府機關及民營廠商所送資料彙編總表，飭由駐美商務參事處向美國商務部國際貿易署洽辦，此項總表僅供美方決定國別配額時之參考。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十五日電〕我外交部參事李幹，十五日下午接見記者時曾表示，美國援華款四億元，雖去我國之需要甚遠，但如妥爲利用，則對我國目前之動搖經濟局面仍大有幫助。李氏曾因有關美國經濟援華事務，於去歲十二月赴美，頃返國向當局報吿有關援華各問題而途次東京，返國後，當再赴美國繼續其任務。李氏透露，四億元援華款項中，計有六千萬元暫時劃作建設費用，刻正準備一項詳細計劃，俾使我國以援助款項，向國外購買貨物，而售之於私人工業商家，所得之利潤，另立特別帳戶，特別帳戶中之一部份存款，亦可用於建設，但大部份當予凍結，俾能以吸收市面流通法幣之方法，而阻遏我國之通貨膨脹。</p>

<h3>立院通過　考選部組織法　考試法下次會中三讀　組織慰問團等兩案已予否决</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立法院第一會期第廿次會議，十六日舉行，孫科主席，晨九時半開會，通過上次會議記錄後，即依議程進行討論事項，處理案件如次：（一）廿一人委會函送草擬立法院戰區軍民慰問團組識辦法請公決案，以多數委員認爲此項動議原爲中原戰事而提，今時效已過，且政府對戰後中原善後救濟工作推動頗力，立院已無再組戰區慰問團之必要，經辯論半小時，後該案終以二四九人（在塲委員三五八人）之反對而被否決。（二）王兆榮等提議擬咨請政院電飭上海市政府，迅將六月六日逮捕之學生即行釋放，以維人權案，此案當遭陸京士等多人反對，以爲不應以保障人權之大帽子迫使政院對匪諜及職業學生亦不能予以處分，致失立院戡亂行憲之立塲，表決結果，該案亦以二七〇人（在塲委員三六九人）之反對而被否決。（三）法制委會報吿考選部組識法草案案，由法制委會召集人張金鑑說明審査經過後，略經討論，即逐條進行二讀，並經會衆同意省略三讀程序，將該草案無異議通過。（四）法制委會報吿審査修正考試法草案案，由法制委會召集人劉明侯說明審查經過後，以時已過午，乃吿散會，午後三時半續會，開始對考試法草案進行二讀，逐條討論，各委員對草案中規定省區公務人員老試分在各省區舉行，應考人以本籍爲限一點，爭辯極烈，終仍維持原案，並删除考試及格之公務人員必要時得加訓練之規定，此外，僅有文字修正，下午七時二讀完畢，決定下次院會進行三讀後散會，其餘議程所列各案均未及討論，將於十七日開第廿一次會議繼續處理。</p>
<h3>立院人少事多</h3>
<p>各委及職員漏夜工作</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立院發言人談：「日來雖在炎威迫人之溽暑中，各立委曁預算委員會及有關單位之職員，均多漏夜工作，星期日例假要無暇顧及矣。尤某當此行憲伊始之際，各種法案規章均有待立院之審議制定與整理，就目前該院各單位所用之職員人數與工作情形觀之，大有「人少事多」之概，但因名額關係，致各方轉業人員尙未能盡量容納，近雖有人主張縮减職員名額，原爲節省開支，用心固善，惟依照事實上之需要，不但不應縮减，且應酌予增加，始可加速工作效率，减少現有職員過勞現象」。</p>
<h3>陳立夫擬訪歐</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕中國立法院副院長陳立夫十五日談稱：渠與馬歇爾久別二年，此次得重晤馬氏，殊爲欣慰。陳氏復謂：渠現在美國考察民主之「運用」。渠曾請敎馬歇爾如何擬訂政府預算程序，「馬歇爾在處理款項之管制與運用等複雜問題方面，曾給余若干最有價値之提示」。陳氏幷謂，返國之計尙未確定，渠希望返國之前先訪問歐洲，訪歐之行或在九月間。</p>
<h3>吳國楨僕僕京滬</h3>
<p>曾謁翁院長商美援問題</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕滬市長具國楨十六日最自滬乘車抵京，當即住謁翁文灝院長並往訪吳鐵城。下午出席美援運用委會及美經濟合作總署駐華分署聯席會議，晚七時復訪陳方等友好。據吳氏語記者：此來純爲出席美援運用會議，上午與翁院長所談者亦爲美援問題。記者詢以美援物資運達時，滬市將要求分配若干？吳氏謂，此爲整個問題，滬市問題現尚未談及。吳氏此來並未晋謁總統，已於十六日夜車返滬。</p>
<h3>財政部人事</h3>
<p>姜書閣任國稅署長</p>
<p>王撫洲調長錢幣司</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕直接稅署及稅務署合併成立國稅署，財部發表首任國稅署長由前稅務署長姜需閣祖任，同時並發表前直接稅署署長王撫洲調任錢幣司長，錢幣司代理司長楊慶邨則調任參事。</p>
<h3>「促成對日和約」案　監院今提會討論　審查會中多主早日訂立</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕監委鄒魯等九十四人前提之「請政府早促成對日和約」案，監院定十七日舉行第廿次會議討論決定其是否卽向政府提出糾正案。按該案前於該院第十四·十五兩次會議提出討論後，決定組審査委會提付審査，十六日晨十時即舉行審査會予以討論，計出席委員卅餘人，胡文暉主席，各委員均先後就提案內容提出原則性之研討，若干委員均主張政府應爭取主動，早日促成對日和約之訂立，本案以迅速提出爲宜，另一部份人士則認爲可先交外交當局確實調査研究，如遲未訂立對日和約政府確有失職之處，再由大會決議提出彈劾案或紏正案，旋經表決，後者遭否決，並決定於十七日大會中提出報吿討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕京某報載一消息謂：「將來在對日和會中，我國必要時可放棄否決權，業經官方證實，惟放棄否決權，係爲有條件者，卽我國政府認爲若干問題能在事先協商獲得解決」。經記者詢諸外部發言人，據答：此消息絕對不確，我國對日和會之態度，在四日外次葉公超對中央社發表之談話中，已重予明白宣示。其末句且强調：「我政府仍保持其一貫之立塲，俾中國能在和會中保有特殊之地位。蓋必如是，吾人方能希望實現吾人所認爲確能保障中國利益及世界和平之和約。渠信在任何塲合，王外長或任何官方人士，均不致曾考慮及或竟證實某報之報道內容。記者相信：葉公超聲明後，中國政府或不致再輕易作促開和會之努力，蓋在如此世局中，此舉實無必要，更無可能。</p>
<h3>賴璉來滬轉美　考察工程教育</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕立委賴璉赴美考察工費敎育，已於十六日夜率赴滬，稍事逗留後，即搭機一飛美。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立法院宣布，頃據預算委員會某負責人稱：本會分組審査報吿，對於戡亂建國動員委會，雖有「擬向行政院提出書面質詢」之建議，但預算委員會議因行政院所造送之普通及特別預算內，均未列有該會經費預算，故對於該會問題「決定不予討論」。</p>

<h3>強權政治與韓國悲劇</h3>
<p>韓國的悲劇，是注定了；朝鲜的分裂，是無可遭免了。這是遠東大屬的危機，黄海時代的大波瀾。此一危機之來臨，波灡之起伏，當以朝鮮南北分裂爲契機。近據漢城消息，韓國議會已於本月十二日正式通過憲法草案，決定十四日起，開始組織民主政府。聯合國將於九月舉行大會，必將根據監督韓國選舉二代表團報吿，採取行動。而北諱也於十一日宣佈其憲法生效，並定下月二十五日普選，成立其所謂北韓人民政府。同時，莫斯科和北壤電台，大碑抨擊南韓和美國；漢城電臺也問駡北壤，彼此唇槍舌劍，互不相讓。這形勢，說明韓國南北的分裂，已成不可避免之局；美蘇在朝鮮的對峙，已由冷戰面迫近　戰邊緣。這形勢的演變和發展，對遠東，對中國，將有重大的影響，值得重視。</p>
<p>韓國又名朝鮮，是大戰後爭執最大和糾紛最多的地帶之一。我們曾經指出：這些爭執和紏紛的造成，乃是開羅會議，波茨坦會我，和莫斯科外長會議歷次的秘密外交，鑄成了大錯，不啻早為韓國前途安排了一　悲劇。一九四三年十月的開羅會議，對韓國的獨立自由雖由中國發動而提供了保證，可惜「決定在相當時期，更朝鮮自由獨立一，因爲「獨立」「自由」有時空底限制，在一定底時間內不能給予，所以這保證不啻落空了一半。尤其錯誤可笑的，波茨坦會議決定以朝鮮北緯三十八度為界，由美蘇軍隊分別佔領韓南韓北，而不採混合佔領方式，無形分割了韓國南北的盲腸，致招今日分裂的後果。一九四五年雅爾達會議，蘇聯更對朝鮮半島若干島嶼，提出領土要求，羅斯福總統也被迫答應了。同年十二月莫斯科外長會議，決定美蘇分佔韓南北，由軍司令部代表組織混合委員會，協助成立朝鮮臨時政府，然後再建統一的民主自治政府。不過在韓國完全獨立以前，尙需經過五年的委任託管。朝鲜人民初則反對託管，反對美蘇軍隊的分治，充分表現了民族獨立的精神、從而追隨了美蘇，在政治上崛起左有派，和不親美又不親蘇的中間派。美蘇軍隊在朝鮮北緯三十八度築立了柵欄，朝鮮政黨也在這柵欄下分立了堡壘，相互議馬，彼此對立。</p>
<p>從地緣政治觀點說，地理的分離決定政治的分離，韓國　北的分離，好像是被强權政治注定了的。在漢城的美蘇混合委員會，從一九四六年三月成立起至去年十一月十四日聯合國大會通過七項方案時止，美蘇很少和諧空氣，祗是加深了南北地理的分裂。聯大方案通過，蘇聯即拒絕合作；依聯大方案成立的朝鲜委員會，在韓國的工作，更遭北韓的白眼，陷委員會的代表於啼笑皆非之境。委員會初想和諧韓閥南北，後來便完全支持南韓，乃至變成五月十日南韓選舉的助選團。現在南韓的議會，在李承晚金性洙等支持下，他們所要成立的政府，是保守性的政府，外交上則以親美爲目的。北韓的憲法早已完成，照金日成的政治路綫，他們所要經過普選成立的政府，乃是共產政府，內政外交完全聽命於蘇聯。在這兩極形勢下，中間派的金九金奎植等，處境最悲哀，他們一方面悲憤祖國分裂的悲劇，意圖挽回旣倒的狂瀾，一方而也缺乏政洽家光明磊落的態度，他們仍不免隨波逐流，而投向北韓勢力。金九金奎植等的向左轉，有人說是美國治韓的失敗。最近美國對韓政策，感到進退失據的苦悶，都是　對韓以及對遠實採取消極政策所招致的錯誤。</p>
<p>所謂韓南，卽朝鲜半島北緯卅八度以南地帶；這地帶佔全韓三分之二的人口，大半生產靠糧食。南韓唯一的武裝部隊，是一支三〇·〇〇〇人的警官隊，和二三·〇〇〇美軍。美軍佔領南韓，每年消費將近二億五千萬美元，牠是支付了重大的代價，來保衛這半節直腸。美國的確臨時考盧着退出南韓的辦法，紙要美蘇關係有好轉，美國自必退出南韓的。卒於北韓，卽朝鲜半島卅八度以北地帶，而積較南韓大，惟人口僅佔全韓三分之一，其他擁有全韓大部的工業，並生產國區所需的電力。北韓的武裝很強大，能有一支一二五·〇〇〇人的人民共產軍，受五〇·〇〇〇人蘇軍的支持，兵精械强。如果以南北韓力量的對比來說，一旦有事，美國在朝鮮的衆寡懸殊的軍隊地位，一定極爲脆弱。美國把防衛南韓的責任，移交聯大的委員會以代替美國軍府，與對日政策逈然不同，表微美國對韓政策的脆弱與退嬰。結果是：美國政策熊脆弱，韓國的若千政黨愈轉向北韓。北韓進一步，南韓退兩步，美國在南韓統治政策的失收，殆成定局。</p>
<p>看趨勢，韓國南北的分裂，已無可避免，兩個政府的出現表示類似希臘的內戰幾已迫近朝鮮。從本月十一日十二日兩天起，說明兩個朝鲜的短兵相接，業已箭在弦上。要之，這形勢的演變和發展，對於中國和遠東的和平將是萬分不利的。因而我們要喚起美蘇政治家的注意：朝鲜的分裂，刺鮮悲劇的演出，他們要負責的。希臘半島的烈火，放火者不是希臘人，而是焚燒希臘歷史文明物質文明的强權執戈者。今天的朝鮮局勢，正與希臘的危機相同，毀滅朝鮮的，焚燒朝鮮的，將非三千萬朝鲜人民，而是講地緣政治軍略形勢的强權者！</p>

<h3>譴責聖地戰事威脅和平　安理會頒新停戰令　阿猶雙方準備無條件接受</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十五日電〕聯合國安理會今夜以當試表決辦法，核准美國所提之決議。其中主張命令阿猶雙方在三百內停止戰事。安理會逐節核准此一包括九點之決議，但最後之核准，猶待對整個決議投票表決。九國代表贊成在三日內停戰之規定。叙利亞投票反對，阿根廷棄機。有關巴勒斯坦局勢威脅和平一節，竹以嘗絨表決辨法以八　對一　加以核准。兩票素權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十五日電〕聯合國安全理事會今夜通過事國提案，飭令巴勒斯坦阿拉伯興猶太雙方於三日內停戰。耶路撒冷城方面並須於廿四小時內無條件停戰。新停戰令較以前決議爲嚴厲，阿猶任何　方倘漠視此項命令，等於破壞世界和平。屆時安理會必須立即考慮實施停戰命令之各種措施。新決議並規定訓令聯合國調解員貝那多特監督停戰，並繼續在阿猶雙方間調解。蘇聯代表馬立克表示反對，認爲貝氏企圖破壞分治計劃。英國代表賈德幹稱，安理會應充分注意阿拉伯方面關於上次休戰協定施行不公之申訴，英國雖贊成美國提案，但不承認阿拉伯人爲侵略者</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕開羅及台拉維夫傳來報吿，謂阿拉伯及猶太雙方均可望無條件接受安全理事會所通過於星期日夜起生效之新停戰令。頻受打擊之聯合國聲與至此不啻爲之一振。阿拉伯聯盟傳已通知聯合國秘書長，恐不及於明日起在耶城區實行休戰，但以色列則已命令其耶城區之司令於十二小時內開始無定期之休戰，當休戰決議經安理會通過之消息傳抵阿拉伯首都後，人心激昂，開羅學生遊行反對接受休戰，高呼打倒美國，然髙級當局，則顯然有順從安理曾決議之意。阿盟秘書長阿柴姆在記者招待會上，承認爲避免制裁起見，阿拉伯國祗有接受休戰之一途。台拉維夫之猶人得訊歡呼雀躍，視之爲和平的肯完希望。同時貝那多特伯爵已準備離成功湖重返巴勒斯坦以監督新休戰之執行。英代表賈德幹表示，在巴勒斯坦問題目前的困難階段中，躊躇的步驟對於整個國際和平的機構將有致命打擊。美代表傑蘇伯表一示希望此次休戰不致再遭浪費，以免失去此一最後機會。埃代表在未奉開羅訓令前，拒絕表示意見。倫敦英外部發言人雖認再度休戰已帶來樂觀希望，但覺此一整倘問題，尙須費一番功夫整理。</p>

<p>〔中央社仰光十五日電〕緬甸自六月卅日宣佈大赦令後，截至現在止，共黨投誠者達二百人。但共黨領袖塔欽譚敦，則未表示投誠意願。緬甸共黨份子刻仍繼續其以往之活動，破壞交通，攻擊駐紮於邊遠村落中之政府軍，但政府軍力極大，共黨常被迫作獸散，進免正面攻擊。</p>

<h3>蘇或將更進一步　封鎖奧京交通</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕據十五日透露；西方國家刻正研究蘇聯師承柏林故按，下令限制奧京維也納區交通之可能。權威人士稱，如蘇聯突然出此，英美法「不致驚異」。按維也納雖亦由四强管制，然深在蘇佔區內，與柏林相互耀映。若干西方外交家相信，蘇聯於拒絕西方所提解除柏林之團之抗議時，附帶威　或將以同樣手段對付維也納。據指出蘇聯致三國之覆文稱，蘇聯「硏討」一九四五年六月杜魯門。史逹林換文後，以爲「英美法軍隊僅可能進入德京柏林及奧京維也納，衆人盡知攻下此兩城者乃蘇軍。」蘇聯緊稱，由於西方設置西德政府及自行發行新幣，三國在柏林之權利已吿廢置。雖維也納區尙未發生類似情形，外交界認爲蘇聯儘可　藉任何口實，而阻止西方之進入維也納。</p>

<h3>三強將以決門性姿態　應付柏林新危機　蘇聯可能封鎖空中走廊</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕外交部人士透露：英美法就柏林危機所持之聯合新行動，將於週末以後出現。艾德證首相今日曾與英駐美大使通電話，貝文外相亦再度接見法大使馬西格星。發言人雖未透露新行動之內容，但表示決將較抗議爲更進一步。觀察家相信，西方國家步　之未　堅強，乃法國態度躊躇之故，然信週末經英美再與巴黎接洽後，必可強化法國之立塲，至　在星期一，西方三強必能以決鬥性的聯合新姿態出現。</p>
<p>〔合衆肚華盛頓十五日電〕西方三國將以何策打破柏林之封鎖迄今仍無跡象。然據稱華府倫敎及巴黎最髙當局刻正考慮下列步驟：（一）以新照會致莫斯科，逐條駁斥蘇聯之理由。，（二）以報復手段對付在世界他處之蘇人，如蘇人之在日本者悉在美國之支配下。（三）三國更可在經濟上制裁蘇聯之貿易。同時若千外交官相信杜魯門總統之召開國會特別會議，更可壯國務院之胆，蓋議員留駐華府，行政立法聯絡可望密切，據稱必要時美國可採取迅速之行動</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統咨文國會　召集國會特別會　共和黨指此舉完全爲政治性質</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕大多數共和黨人仕十五日對社魯門總統要求於七月廿六日在開特別議會表示忿怒。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電」杜魯門總統今日返白宮，立即以「國家利益」爲重，正式資請國會在本月廿六日召開特別會議。共和黨方面訾爲一種「下作政策」，「借屍還魂」與「詭計」。</p>
<p>一部份民主黨義員亦預料該會恐無成就。另一部份則稱之爲積極行動。此種特別會議可謂民主黨大會之意外收穫，或可決定本屆總統競選運動。但杜氏之政敵在國會發言機會亦不弱，國會仍可通過總統所反對之各種法案。在國會休會之時，全國人民即感覺舉行特別會議殆無濟於事。據民主黨副總統候選人巴克萊宣稱，總統此種決定，勇敢正當，參院議長共和黨員范登堡則稱，此爲滿任政府之歇斯的里亞性最取後喘息，完全出於政治作用。</p>

<h3>美英太平洋艦隊　將舉行聯合演習　英總部下月自港遷星洲</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港十六日電〕英太平洋艦隊軍艦七艘，將出總司令鮑毅德率領，於下邊駛日本，參加美太平洋艦隊之演習。鮑氏所乘旗艦爲萬順巡艦「倫敦」號，其餘諸艦爲萬順巡艦「蘇賽克斯」號，驅逐艦「　蘇克」號，「康斯登斯」號，「柯莫斯」號，「康　特」號及「哈特」號。鮑毅德順便將向在日本之盟國領袖辭行，蓋英太平洋艦隊總部將於八月底自香港遷新加坡故也。據蘇軍政府總文機關報每日紀事報稱，蘇航空專家認爲西德至柏林之空中走廊範圍過廣，蘇當局已決定限制在走廊內之飛行以保障安全。接近蘇軍政府之德人謂該蘇聯政治官員所稱之漏洞，即爲柏林興西德間之空中走應。據該德政治官員稱，」西方國家接獲蘇聯之覆文後，不論採取任何行動，蘇聯對柏林之政策決不變更，如以爲蘇聯之覆文爲莫斯科願由四强討論德國問題，誠屬大謬。西方强國各願舉行此等談判，蘇聯或可同意，但蘇聯決不主動發起。蘇聯嶺文之眞正意義，乃爲解除封鎖之要求已予肯定的拒絕。趁早由蘇聯完全控制柏林對於蘇聯有重大之影饗，正如蘇聯在巴爾幹勢力之維持及對靼韃尼爾海映之控制，對蘇聯政策之影響同樣重要。柏林爲西歐政治經濟交通之中心，必須由蘇聯控制，蘇聯決不放鬆迫使西方盟國退出柏林之努力。索柯洛夫斯基已自莫斯科携來史達林最近的訓令，將嚴格予以執行。西方國家目前在匆遽進行的討論，決不影響蘇聯在德國之政策，蓋蘇聯在德之政策，早已肯定決定故也。」。</p>

<p>加斯貝利總理昨與總工會領袖談判時，加氏以堅決之態度，聲明政府將使用一切可資調用的力量，以制止總罷工，並不惜於必要時出動軍隊接收主要公用事業。總工會態度之軟化，殆卽本於此等原因。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十六日電〕總工會雖下令停止總罷工，但今晨各地仍有新暴動發生。羅馬有人擲手溜彈七枚，並有槍擊巡警情事。陶格里亞蒂被刺至今卅六小時內，官方公佈全國已死七人，傷五百五十五人。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕倫敦外交界人士確信莫斯科已放棄由下週三之南斯拉夫共黨大會傾翻或改造狄托元帥之一切希望，故已從事計劃對南共領袖實施嚴厲之制裁。今日羅馬尼亞京城共產情報髙出版之公報，載有猛烈抨擊南共四大領袖之文字，並曰，南共大會在恐怖政權之下召開，不能認爲係代表黨員之眞正意見。由此可見蘇聯及共產情報局之採取制裁南共領袖之行動，爲期當已不遠。</p>

<h3>軍大人鬧兩戲院　擲彈死傷廿一人　捕獲疑犯廿三名訉問後已解警備部</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕軍人騷擾戲院之事，邇來層出不窮，雖經當局一再設法防止，事實上反有變本加厲之勞。昨晚九江路大舞台及中正東路共舞台兩大平劇院，又因過境部隊士兵觀劇不遂，先後聚衆滋事，甚且投擲手溜彈數枚，發生死傷十餘人之慘劇。金陵東路上之黄金大戲院亦曾一度發生紏紛，幸即告平息。當大舞台及共舞台手溜彈爆炸之際，路人頗有橫遭禍殃者，觀衆更飽受虛驚。出事後維持治安之軍　及警局飛行堡壘均聞訊趕到，在兩處拘獲肇事士兵二十三人，已於今晨一時由憲兵團第一營部偵訊後，解送警備司令部法辦。</p>
<p>昨晚八時大舞辜夜場開　後，忽有過境青年軍士兵二十餘人前來，由馬馳·夏傑兩人爲首，要求免費入塲觀劇，駐院憲兵及院中稽査夏雄章即吿以招待軍人規定爲每星期日，平時則不能免費入塲。該士兵等乃怏快而去。約四十分鐘後，竟復糾集六七十人，由馬馳等率領重行到院，擬强行衝人塲內。憲兵睹狀乃急加阻止，雙方在戯院門口爭持之際，騷擾之士兵中有人竟將携帶之手溜彈一枚擲出，在大門靠東人行道側轟然爆炸，彈片四飛之下，適有年三十一歲業電料之甬人董興，在該處觀看廣吿脾，苜當其衝，當塲炸斃。此外受彈片炸傷者有院中職員劉金發·范恒逹·范憲章。陳云根。吳錫九，路人譚克祥·潘利長·陳心皇·陳文生·陳瑞有·孫洪緯。徐鄭氏。孫桂。陳如寳·馮克榮·矗立紅·孫熙康等多人。一時號叫奔避，秩序大亂。老閘分局得報，即由趙分局畏率領員警趕往，警備大隊及憲兵隊亦立派軍會到塲，但肇事士兵已一哄而散，僅捕獲嫌疑犯二〇二師士兵孫德明一人，死傷者立即車送仁濟醫院。</p>
<p>大舞臺案甫吿一段落，十時四十五分共舞台又出事端。該院昨晚上演後部白蛇傳，開演後即有靑年軍及其他過境士兵陸續入塲，後排座位幾全部爲彼等所佔。至將近散塲時，又有靑年軍數十人欲進塲觀劇，院中職員以座位已滿，且即將散塲，拒絕彼等入內，不料彼等竟强將鐵門撬開，一擁而入。院方恐生事端，乃急電軍憲機關報吿，時在大舞台維持秩序之憲兵警備人員及警局飛行堡壘即奉命轉往共舞台，迨抵達時，戲已演畢，觀衆正由兩旁太平門退出，塲中士兵見軍憲警人員到臨，大起反感，哄關聲中第七排第一位處忽起轟然一聲，有士兵將手溜彈一枚拋擲於地前爆炸，當場在近旁之看客姚中芳（男性）及朱先蘭（女性）兩人受彈片炸傷，其他尙未出院之看客均驚　萬狀，紛紛奪路而逃。軍警憲兵乃即將院內有肇事嫌疑之士兵加以逮捕，時戯院門外已退集觀劇士兵二百餘八，一部份並自太平門退入大世界內，混亂中又有手溜彈一枚在大世界內爆發，憲兵爲防止事態擴大，即鳴槍數發示威，並嚴密警戒，彼等見勢不逞，始怏怏散去。</p>
<p>常塲經軍憲逮捕者有青年軍獨立旅士兵向國英·　宗生·陶耘書·熊紹貴·劉孝忠·劉向陽。黄星龍·巫國政。陳玉梅·陳憲一·譚德華·林國成·吳繼昌·李祥英，裝甲司令部駐滬儲運處上士班長王樂祥，靑年軍二〇八師士兵　　東，整編廿一師士兵于明方，及在共舞台前逮捕之銅山圑管區士兵魏玉福，嘉定民衆自衛團員蔡愛生，國防部第二應邵　民等廿二名，連同大舞臺前逮捕之孫德明，於十一時半全部押赴鳳陽路憲兵第一營部，即晚分五組由團附鄒理等逐一審訊。內據靑年軍士兵　德華供稱，携帶手溜彈之同伴爲號兵楊樹雲，惟在混亂時，已逃逸云。審訊至今晨一時完畢，當將各犯連同口供筆錄轉解警備部法辦</p>
<p>當事件發生後，各戲院聞訊極爲震驚，戲劇業公會擬於當晚假皇后大戲院召開聚急會議，旋以大無臺及共舞台兩院內部損失尙輕，且爲時已晏，乃改定於今日開會商討一切。又悉治安當局昨晚已通知過滬各部隊長官，今日起勿令部下外出云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕南洋醫院昨晚於共舞合出事後一小時，曾有一受傷士兵投院醫治，據稱名楊紹雲，係在大世界內被手溜彈片所傷，因傷勢頗重，恐有性命之虞，該院爲愼重計，電吿憲兵隊。該隊以此人與譚德華所供之楊樹　姓名僅差一字，認爲有擲彈之嫌，現正調査之中。憲兵隊捕獲共舞台肇事嫌疑士兵押上警備車。（本報攝）大舞台被擲手溜彈後，軍憲隊趕到搜査彈壓。（本報攝）</p>

<p>鍾　逹庭長於上午九時零五分宣佈開　，首由出事時在塲之嵩山路警局驚長李健英供述目擊搗毀社局情形，以後依次傳審舞女榮英鳳，尤玲玲，以及在社局諸願時髙呼『拿出勇氣來」之準舞女金英（金英曾自稱女學生，又謂經小姊妹慫恿，充當舞女，但無舞女執照）。三被吿對在警局時之口供，全部否認。以後各被吿，亦俱謂到社局已在四時後，絕不承認有動手搗毀情事。當日在塲警士，昨出庭作證時，都謂隔時已久，對動手搗毀者之面容，多已糢糊不淸，不敢指認，僅社局職員張茂盛證稱：勝利舞廳舞女羅英，曾拆下秘書處木牌，並以之搗碎玻璃等物。羅英本人供述，則謂絕未動武，當日被拘、係因頭髮散亂之故。</p>
<p>拘捕疑犯四原則</p>
<p>昨日作證之各飛行堡壘隊員口供，多謂當時拘捕嫌疑犯，係根據上峯所示之四原則：（一）手足有汚泥者，（二）衣服被撕碎扯裂者，（三）頭面有傷痕者，（四）頭髮散亂者，俱應逮捕。而各被吿供述之被捕理由，則以未帶國民身份證及職工會員證者爲多。</p>

<h3>開審舞潮案花絮</h3>
<p>舞潮案昨在地院首次開庭，舞女職工家屬特證到庭旁聽者數十人，無旁　證之家屬，　集地院門口，探頭錯望，頗有侯門深似海的意味。</p>
<p>昨天庭上有個特點，即證人方面，包括飛行堡壘隊員，社會局工友等，對所詢當時動手搗毀社會局的舞女職工，回答的話，千遍一例：因爲時過境還及服飾的變換，不能確指出來。在被起訴的舞女職工們，對法官間話，一槪都說「我不曉得」，「我不知道」，「我沒有打」。</p>
<p>鐵窗內外　兩副頭臉</p>
<p>同是被起訴的嫌疑犯，在押的職工，都髪長過耳，衣履不整。交保的仍飛機其頭，光亮照人。舞女則無論在押交保，一律樸質無華，不施脂粉。</p>
<p>受不起訴處分之舞女洪小萍，盛裝到庭旁聽，面置克羅米限鏡，外貌頗華貴。在旁聽席上，頻頻向律師及在苦難中的姊妹打招呼。</p>
<p>交保的秦嫻芬，戴深度近視眼鏡，不像舞女，像個無邪的女學生。據供，被捕原因就因有戴眼鏡女人打人毀物，實則並非本人。</p>

<h3>庭上小風波　記者爭席次</h3>

<h3>割腦療瘋術（二）　青年醫師　劉明鐸的新成就</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　邵慎之</p>
<p>〔本報靑島十二日航訊〕他作了一個勉强的警喻：「這猶如原有四根電綫通過電流，現在割掉一根或兩根，電流仍然可以繼續」。他繼續說：　「一部份生理學家把腦額葉的功能不分區域，而視其整個部分為精神上的主宰，實則額葉切除的多少問題，較諸切除的部位尤爲重要！所以，他說：我們可以想到精神病很可能是這種額葉綜合能力不正常或額葉中傳導連絡發生不正常的結果。</p>
<p>劉明鐸醫師引用了一般學者的研究成果而加以抉擇。他說起在一九三六年，之Noniz氏曾用額葉切除術治療一個診斷不明的息者結果很好。以後，腦部外科家相繼而起，試用於羊癲和分裂性精神病，對於緊張症（Kataonie）的效力尤爲顯著。所以用額葉切除術治撩分裂性精神病及羊癲的理由，有些學者以爲或者由於：（一）血流的改變，（二）淋巴循環的改變，（三）傳導路的改變等原因。在發羊癲時，血管周圍被神經膠質細胞所包圍，因此，引起血管痙　而發生貧血現象，關癲發作原由實卽在此。一旦將這種痙攣血管切斷，那麼痙攣就可以解除。有些學者解釋精神病息者所以發生異常動作，往往是錯覺，幻覺使然。是的，這種幻覺和錯覺，是由於病患者以前的經驗智識發生了不正常交織的緣故。如果把這種不正常的交織鬆懈，錯覺和幻覺立卽可以消除。</p>
<p>「而額葉切除術是可以完成這項工作的。」他下結論道：「所以這對於精神病息者有益。」因此「目前的腦部外科家，多主張用額葉切除術治療分裂性精神病患者，有幻覺的精神病，激動性精神病，由於無法治療之疾病如癌腫所引起的激烈疼痛，對於分裂性精神病用胰島素休克Yusuli　nshock及Electroshock治療無效的患者，他們尤其主張用切除術一。</p>
<p>「可是，他又說：一這種手術，目前仍在試驗時期，據我所知，對於已做手術而有結果的病例還很少呢」。</p>

<h3>游資入各個市場　物價暒又全面回漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市物價於穩定兩日之後，昨日又全面回漲，紗布米糧岌日用品上昇均在一成以上。物價回漲之主因，據有關人士之分析如下：（一）華北游資一批約有四萬億之數，過去曾被設法凍結，目下已侵入市塲，（二）四聯昨日批准合作事業生產貸款，爲數在三萬億左右，日內即可貸放，（三）前日發表之生活指數，上漲幾近一倍，影響工廠之成本，間接刺激日用品價格。</p>
<p>華股於昨日下午又有滿堂紅之局面，永紗於漲停後有加七百元出售者。棉布因游資關係，售價上揚，囤貨大肆活動，貨主不肯脫手，行情大漲，龍頭細布已逼近四千大關。米糧因無錫糧價堅定，不再下跌，兼以銀根鬆動，貨主不肯輕易脫手，各級米一致普漲，上白重出三千萬關。其他日用品因生活指數上漲，工廠將調整廠縏，均吿上揚。</p>
<p>又昨日本市暗息，空前奇昻。棉紗市塲暗息一度髙至得千元四千元，股票市場亦髙至千元九百元；一般市塲利率爲五角，同業日拆亦髙至三角。但利息雖髙，物價依然上漲，足以說明人心看好，商人不辭背髙利面進貨；此爲目前漲風之特點，亦可間接有出經濟之危機。</p>
<h3>食米價一致回挺　白粳　薄稻重叩三千萬大關</h3>
<p>米市復見上漲，緣無錫報價又漲，業外各物一致挺升，雖在銀根緊俏下，貨主仍扣緊價格，早市曾見挺升二百萬元，收市終有一部份貨主不耐頭寸之緊，售出較多，乃稍見回軟，終升約一百五十萬元。北市塲粳薄稻及羊秈均重叩三千萬，特髙粳達三千三百萬，南市塲松江薄稍三千萬，白陰元各三千萬，糙秈米廠胃尙濃，亦加一二百萬，二市到貨四三六九石。</p>
<p>麵粉　繼續挺升，開即以米價之上挺圈外各物均漲，執貨者扳持甚力，考車粉甫開即抵九百萬，後以九百十五萬收市，挺五十萬。兵船粉八百八十萬，漲三四十萬元，雜牌粉實銷取之不懈，孔雀粉送到九百十萬，建成·紅峰。各加三十萬。麩皮福新大包爲六百八十萬，升三十萬元，小麥小廠開一一五〇萬。</p>
<p>雜糧　全面騰升，在米價及圈外各物上漲之激動下，人心至堅，黄豆因漢口價髙，匯水又大，價不合劃，貨主售意甚淡。乍豆開盤爲一千四百五十萬，後油餅價漲，乃再加一百萬，收市轉疲。苞米挺三百萬，靑帮納取，蠢豆加百萬，元麥北帮有辦，挺二百萬，菉豆銷塲甚呆，略提髙百萬，芝蔴挺二三百萬，生仁廣帮力吸，跳起五六百萬。</p>
<p>食油　賡續挺升，由於黃豆等原料一致上升，且業外各物均提升甚力，散戶心堅，吸力甚强。油廠雖有開出，然尙供不應銷。豆油開價即見加一成，爲六千六百萬，臨收浮多吐出，回低百萬，尙軋升五百萬。生菜油最後五千三百萬，生油開出甚遲，吉桶生油爲八千五百萬，計漲五六百萬，吉小車亦升五百萬。豆餅初開堅俏，畏字餅曾以七百五十萬成交，收市退爲七百二十萬及七百萬邊，仁記進七百萬內。</p>
<h3>中農舉辦　蘇省棉貸</h3>
<p>已逾二千一百億元</p>
<p>計可增產六六萬担</p>
<p>關於本年度中國農民銀行對於蘇省棉花生產貸款若干，面積幾何，產量多寡，及其貸放標準，方式如何，頗爲一般人士所關懷。茲據該行主辦者稱：該行奉命舉辦蘇省棉貸迄今，實際貸放數額已達兩千一百十八億元，內中實物部份硝酸鈉約二百萬斤，過酸钙約五十餘萬斤，共値八百餘億。又現金貸款一千三百餘億，棉田面積共達三三一九九九畝，包括上海市二九九三六畝，　山六五七四二畝，奉賢一九〇六二畝，太倉三五五八六畝，嘉定五八九〇〇畝，南匯六〇五七三畝，常熟四〇七一二畝，江陰二一四八八畝。若以每畝可收籽棉二担計，一履初冬，計可增產六六三九九八祖。貸放標準：（一）貸實，每畝硝酸鈉十二斤，過磷酸鈣三斤（照成本作價）另加四十萬元。（二）貸現收實，每畝現金八十萬。（三）貸現收實，每畝現金四十萬四元，其方式（一）貸實收實，（貸現收實同）所有到期貸款本息，按到期日當日籽棉市價折還實物。（二）貸款按一般方式收還現金本息。</p>
<h3>皮毛輸出停頓　該業提出兩大要求</h3>
<p>目前我國皮毛業已遭遇嚴軍危機，尤以輸出一方面蝕本太大，一般商人咸視國外市塲爲畏途。造成此種情形原因有二：（一）國幣對美金之法定匯率過低，刻雖有證明書之出價，然較之黑市外匯價格相差幾達二分之一。且農民思想頑固，每以米價爲衡定標準，戰前黄狼一對，可換白米一石，而今只換五斗，故儘量提髙出售價格，目影響出口數量。（二）中央銀行外匯審核處頒布寄售出口貨外匯結付辦法後，對於年來採取之寄銷方式打擊甚大。蓋皮毛受季節性之支配，如限期結匯，則商人不能主動爭取正常行市。刻該業希望政府能實行皮毛輸出自衛方案。（一）限期三個月結匯之辦法，應東予改訂，希望限期儘量展長。（二）證明書價格須加提髙，俾所得外匯匯率，適應物價及生活指數。</p>
<h3>西南各省鈔荒</h3>
<p>朱紹良請速恢復印製廠</p>
<p>〔本報重慶十六日電〕朱紹島十六日電王　五部長，謂西南各省需要現鈔數目甚鉅，如僅賴滬運濟，恐緩不濟急。渝市刻因現鈔奇缺，市塲不安，如不急圖補救，後果堪虞。擬請將已准恢復在渝印製廠提前撥款，迅予成立，俾得救濟西南各省鈔荒。另電央行兪總裁，准渝央行塡發本票，作現鈔籌碼週轉，俟現鈔運到後，即予收回。又據渝央行報稱：渝市海日需用二千五百億現鈔，七月份情形特殊，增需六萬億元。</p>
<h3>銀根轉鬆　行局差出</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根緊後回弛，市塲暗息，因籌碼缺乏之故，依然髙踞六角左右。銀錢業票據交換中，國家行局有大額差出，總額共一二九二三億。就中以中央銀行獨家差出一三一七七億爲數最鉅，中國銀行差出二三〇九億，交涌銀行差進一二七一億，農民銀行差出八九五億，中信局差出一〇九九億，郵匯局差進二三七一億，中央會作金庫　建九一　億。商集行莊大交換差進六三一九億，小交換差出二一德。外商與行共計差進六六二五億。據中央銀行表示，昨日之鉅額差出中，大部係支付外埠來滬匯款者。</p>

<p>後市以兩天負担减輕，隔週交割之便，永紗開出即逹漲限，嗣後即實行貼價做開，永紗先加五百元，繼而曾退至一百元。但國行交換差出，最後漲達七百元，美亞加四十元，新光十元，景福四元，除內衣商務閘北大通信誼，及未獲成交之上泥聯地永業外，全部漲達限度，塲外各未上市股票，以紡織股見秀，餘僅平穩。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，因環境利買，業外物資重振，人心驟吿堅挺，津漢川粵等帮，及新買與補空並起，市上買氣濃厚，惟銀根仍緊，做開大都隔日頭寸。　四十二支藍鳳初開即跳一億五千萬左右，嗣以貨主扳俏，價再上揚，近收時頭寸受軋者，稍有吐售，卒以十六億五千萬元結束，比上日回漲二億元。隔日出貨亦軋升一億五千萬元，二十一支雙馬紗因供售較多，現出回升一億九千萬，明日出則好起一億四千萬，其餘各支粗細紗，亦均軋好一·二億不等。　昨日棉布市况，因指數激增，廠商成本加重，大鈔即將發行，甚囂塵上，銀根雖仍暗緊，詎游資又有抵滬之說，而川漢湘津諸帮，相率扒吸，新買購囤活躍，貨主乘機扳價，市勢頓吿挺秀。</p>
<p>龍頭細布初喊三千七百萬元，嗣以金融帮暗中有吸，步昂至四千萬大關，搜求甚段，卒以三千九百五十萬元結束，比上日軋漲一成半許，某他五福藍鷄喇叭童等各檔細布，亦均回漲一·二成左右，此外嗶嘰布粗布及色布士林布等，市盤亦欣欣向榮。　又訊：隔日紡建標售之彩球細布，價爲二千九百五十萬元，聞染廠標進居多，二等品元嗶嘰三千萬元，跳鯉灰色電光斜一千九百六十萬元，另有（86×86）彩花被單，每條價標六百廿五萬元，錦地彩花被單七百萬元，計有二種。</p>

<h3>從公共秩序說到　動手打·開口罵</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>在上海，提起公共秩序，沒有人不搖頭。</p>
<p>先從馬路上說起：交通整理組的警員在路上列超隊的時候，三輪車，「黄卡車」，勉强而不耐地按序前進，等這些警員下了班，則所有車輛莫不並肩而進，錯綜凌亂，一團糟糕。</p>
<p>電車站跟公共汽車站的兩旁，在憲兵荷槍實彈的監視之下，有時候還排不成隊，因爲「動手打」與「開口駡」之流，從來不受約束。大家總還記得：剛剛勝利以後，上海電車的某些乘客，大都習慣於爬窗而進，跳窗而出。一直到今天，車子不到站而勒令停重者有之，打司機，押賣票者亦有之。最近一個月來，這類的紏紛，報上已屢有刊載。</p>
<p>再說戲院吧：勝利以後，當局行了一個德政，就是所有戲院，一槪對號入座。但當實行之始，就遭遇過許多困難，到今天雖然對號的制度幸已確立，但戲院因某些人的不守秩序而大打出手的情事，似已都屬於極平凡的新聞了。</p>
<p>至於肯守秩序的若干小市民，倒大多屬於「弱小民族」，固然痛恨秩序的破產，但也都無能爲力，所以又很善於「司空見慣」。現在，他們尤其顯得不願多事，從前電車上或戯院裏遇到有人抽烟，往往就有許多其他的人，出而噓他幾聲，或說幾句，以示制裁，現在這現象已沒有了。至於在電車上，對婦孺讓座的好習慣，最近以來也不大見到了。</p>
<p>聽說從八月一日起，要强制執行「禁止吐痰」，但在「動手打，開口駡」的今日上海，這種措施實在令人神經過敏地祖心會不曾又引起幾塲「三本鐵公鷄」的請彩演出。</p>
<p>不久前，一位外國記者的文章說：「從上海到東京，恍如從一個混亂的世界，升入安祥的天堂。」這話說得過分嗎？大家且捫心自問！</p>
<h3>美國兵士留在海外的私生子</h3>
<p>— 款乃</p>
<p>在第二次大戰中，美國兵士在海外服役時和當地婦女所生的私生子，總數竟達五十萬人左右，這些孩子們除極少數能和他們的生父重見外，大多數都已經被「遺忘」了。</p>
<p>這些孩子們被遺留在什麽地方呢？大概的統計如下：（一）北非，五千名；（二）英國本土，二萬二千名，（三）義大利，一萬名；（四）比國，單是比京一處就有五千；（五）德國，法國，奧國，共六萬三千名；（六）中國，日本，澳洲，及其他遠東國家，共計約二十萬名。</p>
<p>美國政府對這個問題迄無其體方策。英外相貝文曾在議會中正式發表，「英國曾請美國政府對這些美國士兵留在英國的私生于和他們的母親予以經濟上的援助，但終於無法獲致任何協議。」（本文取材於本月份「雜誌文摘　一）</p>
<h3>聰明的豬</h3>
<p>— 松浦</p>
<p>我們時常聽見一句駡人的話：「你這個笨豬！」其實是錯了，豬不一定全是「笨」的，聰明的豬也不在少數，不過一向不曾爲人們注意罷了。下面就是幾個例十</p>
<p>美國有幾個獵人，曾經馴養小豬，並加以訓練，能帮助人們到樹林內去偽烏，稱爲「獵豬」</p>
<p>法國人常常帶豬到森林中去找冬菇蔴菇等菌類。這種菌深藏在樹根上，從地面上看去是毫無形踪的，而豬的長鼻子能够嗅得此種香味，嗅到之後，就會用鼻子掘下去；採菌的人須及時趕走此豬，否則香菌就會給豬吃掉。</p>
<p>從前美國一隊馬戲團裏，有隻著名的會數紙牌點數的豬。主人給他一張印有點數的紙牌，它就會用前足在地上敲，敲的次數與紙牌上的點數每次都是相同的。雖說馬戲團主人會做出一種暗號，但它能知這自己所敲的次數，也不能不算是一件難得的事。背景的影片中出現了「原子彈」的新聞，豈非犯了時間的謬誤？</p>
<p>爲了適合這兩個條件，海斯設立了一個報紙檔案，搜集了幾百種世界各地的報紙，最早的是一七六九年出版的。有了這個檔案，他便能够把影片中所需要的假新聞與同時間所發生的眞新聞配合起來了。例如，當他「編」一份以巨盜約翰·狄林傑之死爲頭條新聞的「銀幕報紙」時，他在報中挿入了一幅中國水災的地岡，因爲這兩件事情都發生在一九三四年。</p>
<p>不過，因為觀衆絕沒有時間把導演所欲表現的新聞以外的新聞全部閱讀，所以，海斯在報紙的次要地位便濫竽充數起來，隨便把零星拉雜的片斷亂捧進去。有時，兩張大標題不同的一銀幕報紙」，小標題竟會雷同。當然，觀衆是不會發覺這種「小疵」的。</p>
<p>現在，海斯的檔案除了報紙之外，還有一萬多種招貼廣吿和電話簿，數百種法令通吿，數千張明信片。一接獲通吿，他可以立即供應或者編製一張　爾蘭的跑馬票，一張孟買菜單，一張一八四〇年的醫科文憑，或者一張希臘酒瓶上的招貼紙——當然，還有「銀幕報紙」。</p>
<h3>遐菴近作</h3>
<p>— 葉恭維</p>
<p>有酒能全物外春，空山冷抱積苔身；從今不說和羹事，祗與梅花　喜神。</p>
<p>聞賣枝梅百萬錢，人間怪事石難言；由來春色無多子，祗在髙樓廣廈邊。</p>
<p>題舊有朝鮮筆筆名崩浪管鐫李　王家美術工場謹製</p>
<p>神筆何時走傳軍？降王今日久無家！劇憐崩浪成崩土，血染箕封亂如麻。</p>
<h3>八二老翰林　曹叔彥先生</h3>
<p>— 蜀廬</p>
<p>呉門八十二齡老翰林曹元弼（叔彥）續膠佳話，南北報紙，傳載殆遍。讀本月十一日本刋所載凌霄漢閣談薈，於曹翁老翰林之稱，有所辨正，以爲進士而未入翰林院者，不得槪稱翰林，世人往往不察，幷爲一談，其言誠是。但曹翁之被稱翰林，則實不不誤。按翁中光緒甲午科進士。（談薈謂乙未科亦誤。）當時殿試，最重書法，翁以病目，不能作端正楷書，故未與殿試，而以內閣中書用，後於光緒卅四年，江蘇巡撫陳啓泰以翁早歲所著禮經校釋一書具摺進呈，援王圍運進所著書由舉人欽賜翰林院檢討前例，亦奉上諭賜翰林院編修，并將禮經校釋原書發交禮學館，其詳載清實錄，翁之仲兄福元，亦以翰林院編修出在河南開歸鄭許道，護理巡撫，兄弟翰林，一門鼎盛，爲吳門望族。（長兄元恒，即滄洲先生，以醫名，曾徵診淸德宗疾。從兄元忠，官內閣侍讀，以博雅名，著有箋經室　集等。）談薈祗知其初任之職，而未考其後之曾得翰林淸秩也。又談薈謂擅詞章考據金石板本之學，爲當時名公鉅卿所推重，而不及翁之經學湛深，爲海內一人。著述已刋者，有禮經校釋，周易鄭氏義箋釋，周易集解補正，孝經鄭注箋釋，周易學，禮經學，復禮堂集，及述學詩等十餘種，皆好寫精雕，巍然巨帙。至今八旬外髙齡，猶伏案孜孜，撰尙書鄭注箋釋，足徵神明不袞，爲當今魯殿靈光也。至續膠之舉，似足引人詫異，不知翁雙目失明，與唐翁文治金蘭至交，而所病亦同，平日飲食起居，在在需人扶持調護，自王夫人作古後，迄今十餘年，均由其從妹歸常熟張鴻（即作續孽海花者亦名進士）者，朝夕相伴，本無意於續娶，詎其妹以七十髙齡，於今春驟逝，從此孑然孤苦，不得已而有此創舉。故翁與友人書，有「以續膠爲續命之方，亦人間之創格」語，可以見其苦心已。筆者寓翁居近，故知其詳，記之爲讀者吿焉。</p>
<h3>影都「報人」</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>下一次你看好萊塢電影時，假如銀慕上有報紙的近鏡頭，請你注意一下報紙名字，它紹不是你所熟悉的，就連美國人也都未聽見過。每一張影片都是如此。</p>
<p>要知個中究竟，應該請敎這些祗在銀幕上出現的報紙的編輯·發行人·兼印刷者伊爾·海斯。海斯是一個瘦削的，面帶笑容的印刷商，他專門印刷供銀幕用的東西。各攝影塲所用的報紙，招貼廣吿，電報，菜單，戲票，和法令通吿，差不多都由他一手包辦。</p>
<p>當銀慕上要出現一張報紙時，這張報紙必須要是虛構的，這是爲了避免採用眞實的報紙可能引起的法律紏紛。同時，凡觀衆有時間去讀的東西，如頭條標題等，製作必須特別留意，這是爲了避免閱讀速率髙的觀衆「望野眼」。如在以第一次世界大戰爲鄭際雲</p>
<h3>記長虹社</h3>
<p>— 鄭際雲</p>
<p>海上多藝術團體，據予所知者，有萍花社，秋英社，寒之友社，文獻流播，足資證考。而長虹社亦具悠久歷史，且至今不替焉。社中多耆宿，尤以沈心海傳錢慧安衣缽，享盛名數十年，朱良材亦此中健者，今雖物故，而作品傳世，珍逾　寳。當時諸子，均上訪居滬南，心海髙足謝閒鷗，有出藍之譽，亦居大南門之何家支街，相距不遠，於是往還談藝，樂數晨夕，乃結社曰長虹，即設社閒鷗家中，刋有長虹畫集。及此次事變，倭人肆暴，大南門一帶，遭劫更甚，而長虹乃付諸劫灰。閒鷗倉皇出走，無所適從。及喘息甫定，力謀社務之恢復，時心海尙未下世也。社址初在戈登路，旣而遷小沙渡路口，與愛儷園望衡對宇，以藝會友，社友以數十計，均一時名手。令夏興尤展舉，競作扇面，山水人物，花卉翎毛，應有盡有，聞日內舉行扇展，社務正方興未艾，殊可喜也。</p>
<h3>中獄</h3>
<p>— 公孫午</p>
<p>章太炎以蘇報案縏上海獄三年，癸卯獄中自記謂時年三十六，距今四十六年矣。當時獄史，不論西人華人，多已物故，然太炎故舊，猶有略知其事者。獄囚皆有工作，太炎始被派人飯間，洗滌食器，後以文弱，改派裁縫。一代大師，其獄中生活，與今召受刑人所度者無以異。凡人在獄，喜讀佛經，鄒容亦時時就太炎講佛法，太炎以因明入正理論授之，謂學此可以解三年之憂云。容年少，以西人遇囚無狀，憤激內熱，尋病卒。太炎先已路窺佛藏，「涉　華嚴法業涅槃諸經」。自被縏，「專修慈氏，世親之書。此一術也，以分析名相始，以排遺名相終，從入之途，與平生樸學相似，易於　機。解此以還，乃達大乘深趣，私謂釋迦玄言，出過晚周話子不可計數，程朱以下，尤不足論。一其自道如此。然則三歲不覿，何害於治學。</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>科舉考試具破除階級之神效，所謂「十載寒窗苦，一朝姓　香」，所謂「禹門三尺浪，平地一聲雷」，所謂「一舉成名天下聞」，都是傳眞寫實的標語。何以如此成功？則又有微妙的技術運用存焉。</p>
<p>小試。鄕試。會試，每試若千塲，一科不中再一科，往往考到皓首蒼顏，筆禿墨枯，不知經過多少題目，寫過多少文字，然而最主要的則是八股文。頭塲的題目，出在四書，其二三塲之經與策，不過陪襯而已。主試之取去，多以四書文爲標準，所以彼時士子常說「三塲軍頭塲，頭塲重頭篇，頭篇重前八行」。主試的前輩先生應試時由此發達，一旦衡文，亦以此法取士，傳統數百科，由來已久。故士子在「寒窗」，第一須於四書及朱註及前輩之制舉文眾及試帖詩熟爲揣摩練習，次則五經，再次則史地等書，略供參考，各省各塲，皆是如此，千篇一律，置辦或借讀並不爲難，比之後來之學校學費之繁重，相去何啻天淵。以學校員擔相比，民國初年有幾句流行的話說：「總長·總裁·總理·銀行老總的子弟是留學博士；髙等官員。大財商的子弟是大學生；普通官商子弟是中小學畢業；窮人孩子沒書念。」又說：「學位是貴族的。」此亦勢所必然，無可爲諱。而在科學時代則無此病，貧人寒士所預備是這幾部書，幾册文章；闊人富人所需要的亦是這幾部書，幾册文章。縱然他們有大力供給予弟造成天大學問之老博士，到了科塲亦「英雄無用武之地」，而與寒窗處於均等之機會，以取榜上之名。</p>
<p>因爲大員及先進之翰林各，官，素習揣糜，能通聲氣，所以又立「官卷」之限制，即大員或翰林子弟，每科先査應試人數，限以一定之中額，渝限則不准取中，又不准列入前十八名之魁選，以免門閥中人　藉優勢，致妨　士之出路。其地如對舞弊者執法之餒（順治及咸豐各朝，皆有科塲大獄，主考大臣斬首或充軍），主考官愛惜身名，注重文軍知遇，本心一秉大公，冀結文字道義之與，大多不受關節，不肯貪汚。旣有法律制裁於上，又有精神愉快在心，故科塲舞弊，在事實上固不能完全斷絕，而「大公」「至正」印象，極深極普，能把握全國人心，集中信仰，決非偶然。</p>
<p>社會意義，具如上述。但從學術文化方面，則完全落伍了。髙頭講章書法詩賦之外，有些述歷史地理都弄不淸楚。即在閉關時代，亦不足用。（其中有以經濟政治見長樹立功名者，如曾李等人，乃個人之特才運用，決非科舉八股小楷之力。）况世界文化日進之潮流乎？其爲「陳跡」，自屬當然。今所以縷述者，一則此種「平等」精神，制度，不失爲歷史上之重要紀錄；二則今五　中考軾權之機構設置，原與科塲考試不無淵源，的有參考之價値。至於現在考試，自以學校敎育爲基礎，以眞才實學爲目的。記者於學校生活，學校考試，亦有多年閱壓，當另篇述之。</p>

<h3>Military Aid to China Details Finalized, Material Purchases Can Begin; Gu Weijun Visits U.S. Secretary of State Marshall for Long Conversation, Presents List Urging Early Shipment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] Vice President Li-fu Chen, accompanied by Ambassador Wei-jun Gu, paid a courtesy visit to Secretary of State Marshall at the State Department this afternoon. During the hour-long meeting, they discussed the U.S.'s $125 million military aid plan for China with Marshall, and urged the early shipment of military supplies to China. Ambassador Gu told reporters that the details of the plan have been largely finalized, and the purchase of materials can begin.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wei-jun Gu, met with Secretary of State Marshall at the State Department yesterday for an hour, requesting Marshall's assistance in quickly shipping military supplies in accordance with the $125 million military aid to China bill to support the Chinese army. According to Tou's subsequent statement, although the U.S. budget management system is very thorough, China's need for assistance cannot be delayed. Gu did not specify the details of China's request, nor was he willing to predict when the shipment would begin, only saying that the Chinese government had submitted its first list of military needs two months ago.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce reports: In order to control exports and fairly allocate export quotas, the United States has sent a letter requesting our country to submit the required quantities of various materials to be purchased from the United States from July of this year to June of next year. The list of export quota commodities sent by the U.S. includes eight categories: timber, steel, petroleum, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, transportation equipment, building materials, and miscellaneous items. Except for building materials and miscellaneous items (including items such as wax and empty cans for milk), which are not currently needed, all other items meet our country's needs. The required quantity forms have been compiled into a summary table by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce based on the data submitted by various government agencies and private manufacturers, and the Commercial Counselor stationed in the United States has been instructed to negotiate with the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This summary table is only for the U.S. to refer to when determining national quotas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Li Gan, Counselor of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated when meeting with reporters on the afternoon of the 15th that although the U.S. aid of $400 million is far from meeting our country's needs, if used properly, it will still be of great help to our country's current unstable economic situation. Li went to the United States in December of last year due to matters related to U.S. economic aid to China, and has now returned to the country to report to the authorities on various issues related to aid to China. He is en route through Tokyo, and will return to the United States to continue his mission after returning to the country. Li revealed that of the $400 million in aid to China, $60 million has been temporarily earmarked for construction expenses. A detailed plan is being prepared to allow our country to use the aid funds to purchase goods from foreign countries and sell them to private industrial businesses. The profits obtained will be placed in a special account. A portion of the deposits in the special account can also be used for construction, but most of it should be frozen in order to absorb the legal tender circulating in the market and curb inflation in our country.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Taipei, 16th] The Stillman Survey Group left Shanghai by plane for Taiwan yesterday at around 5:00 PM. Due to poor weather, they turned back midway and arrived in Taipei at 11:50 AM this morning. The group of fourteen people, all U.S. officials, went to Caoshan immediately after disembarking. During their week in Taiwan, they will completely decline any banquets and meetings with guests in order to focus on organizing their survey report.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes the Organization Law of the Examination Department; Examination Law to Be Read for the Third Time in the Next Session; Two Proposals, Including the Organization of a慰問團慰問團慰問團Consolation Delegation, Have Been Rejected</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The 20th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 16th. President Sun Ke convened the meeting at 9:30 AM. After passing the minutes of the previous meeting, the meeting proceeded according to the agenda to discuss matters and handle cases as follows: (1) The proposal from the 21-member committee to draft the organizational regulations for the Legislative Yuan's war zone military and civilian慰問團慰問團慰問團consolation delegation for public decision was rejected by a majority of committee members, who believed that the motion was originally proposed for the Central Plains war and the time limit has passed. Moreover, the government has been actively promoting post-war relief work in the Central Plains, and there is no need for the Legislative Yuan to form another war zone慰問團慰問團慰問團consolation delegation. After half an hour of debate, the proposal was finally rejected with 249 votes against (out of 358 committee members present). (2) The proposal by Wang Zhaorong and others to request the Executive Yuan to telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Government to immediately release the students arrested on June 6 in order to maintain human rights was opposed by many people, including Lu Jingshi, who believed that the Legislative Yuan should not force the Executive Yuan to not punish spies and professional students under the guise of protecting human rights, which would undermine the Legislative Yuan's stance on suppressing rebellion and implementing the constitution. As a result of the vote, the proposal was also rejected with 270 votes against (out of 369 committee members present). (3) The Legislative Committee reported on the draft organizational law of the Examination Department. After Zhang Jinjian, convener of the Legislative Committee, explained the review process, the second reading was carried out item by item after brief discussion, and with the consent of the attendees, the third reading procedure was omitted, and the draft was passed without objection. (4) The Legislative Committee reported on the review and amendment of the draft Examination Law. After Liu Minghou, convener of the Legislative Committee, explained the review process, the meeting was adjourned due to the late hour. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon and began the second reading of the draft Examination Law, discussing it item by item. The committee members debated fiercely on the point in the draft that stipulated that the old examinations for provincial and district civil servants should be held in each province and district, and that candidates should be limited to their place of origin.

<h3>Few People and Many Affairs in the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Committees and Staff Work Late into the Night</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesman for the Legislative Yuan said: "Recently, despite the scorching heat, the legislators, the Budget Committee, and the staff of relevant units have been working late into the night, and they have no time to take care of the usual Sunday holiday. Especially at the beginning of the implementation of the constitution, various laws, regulations, and rules need to be reviewed, formulated, and sorted out by the Legislative Yuan. Judging from the number of staff and the work situation of the various units of the Yuan, there is a general feeling of 'few people and many affairs'. However, due to quota restrictions, transferees from various parties have not been able to be accommodated as much as possible. Recently, some people have advocated reducing the number of staff in order to save expenses, and the intention is good, but according to the actual needs, not only should it not be reduced, but it should also be appropriately increased in order to accelerate work efficiency and reduce the overwork of the existing staff."</p>

When reporters inquired with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the answer was: This news is absolutely untrue. Our country's attitude towards the peace conference with Japan has been clearly declared by Vice Minister Ye Gongchao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in his statement to the Central News Agency on the 4th.

Only in this way can we hope to realize a treaty that we believe can guarantee China's interests and world peace." He believed that in any occasion, Minister Wang or any official would not have considered or even confirmed the content of the newspaper's report. Reporters believe that after Ye Gongchao's statement, the Chinese government may not easily make efforts to promote the convening of the peace conference, because in such a world situation, this move is neither necessary nor possible.</p>

<p>[United Press, Beiping, 15th] Chu Xichun, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, told reporters from the United Press on the 15th that North China is the main fortress of democracy against communism. If this industrial and agricultural area falls, not only China but the whole world will suffer a serious blow. North China urgently needs economic assistance, which can be obtained from the US aid to China plan, but in fact, North China has been in a passive position, and it is often heard that 90% of US aid will be given to South China. North China needs assistance more than other places because North China is the key to the future of the Central Plains and South China. He also said: We do not need military assistance, what we need is economic assistance. We believe that the United States should assist Europe, but the communist threat there is not as serious as in North China. If China and its manpower and resources are controlled by the Communists, it will have a serious impact on the whole world. He has drafted a plan and presented it to the government to dig 300 wells and other agricultural improvements, but this does not need to be assisted by the United States, it can be paid for by selling the surplus materials purchased from the United States. We hope that the United States relief fund can be used for construction projects that are beneficial to the people and improve the people's living standards.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Power Politics and the Korean Tragedy</h3>
<p>The tragedy of Korea is destined; the division of Korea is unavoidable. This is a major crisis in the Far East, a major upheaval in the Yellow Sea era. The arrival of this crisis and the rise and fall of the waves will be triggered by the division of Korea into North and South. According to recent news from Seoul, the Korean National Assembly formally passed the draft constitution on the 12th of this month and decided to start organizing a democratic government from the 14th. The United Nations will hold a general assembly in September and will take action based on the report of the delegation supervising the Korean elections. On the 11th, North Korea also announced that its constitution had come into effect and set the 25th of next month for a general election to establish its so-called North Korean People's Government. At the same time, Moscow and North Korean radio stations are fiercely criticizing South Korea and the United States; Seoul Radio is also scolding North Korea. The situation shows that the division of Korea into North and South has become an inevitable situation; the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in Korea has moved from the Cold War to the brink of war. The evolution and development of this situation will have a significant impact on the Far East and China and is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Korea, also known as Joseon, is one of the areas with the most disputes and conflicts after the war. We have pointed out that the creation of these disputes and conflicts is due to the secret diplomacy of the Cairo Conference, the Potsdam Conference, and the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, which have made a big mistake, no less than arranging a tragedy for the future of Korea. Although the Cairo Conference in October 1943 provided a guarantee for the independence and freedom of Korea initiated by China, it is a pity that "the decision to make Korea free and independent in due course" is because "independence" and "freedom" have temporal restrictions and cannot be granted within a certain period of time, so this guarantee is no less than half a failure. In particular, it was ridiculously wrong for the Potsdam Conference to decide to divide Korea along the 38th parallel north latitude, with the US and Soviet troops occupying South and North Korea respectively, instead of adopting a mixed occupation method, which invisibly divided the cecum of Korea, leading to the consequences of today's division. At the Yalta Conference in 1945, the Soviet Union further made territorial demands on some islands of the Korean Peninsula, and President Roosevelt was also forced to agree. In December of the same year, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference decided that the United States and the Soviet Union would occupy North and South Korea respectively, and a joint committee would be organized by representatives of the military command to assist in the establishment of a Korean Provisional Government, and then build a unified democratic and autonomous government. However, before Korea is fully independent, it still needs to go through five years of trusteeship. At first, the Korean people opposed the trusteeship and the division of the country by the US and Soviet troops, fully demonstrating the spirit of national independence, and then followed the US and the Soviet Union, and left and right factions rose in politics, as well as middle factions who were neither pro-American nor pro-Soviet. The US and Soviet troops built a fence on the 38th parallel north latitude, and Korean political parties also established fortresses under this fence, arguing with each other and opposing each other.</p>
<p>From a geopolitical point of view, geographical separation determines political separation, and the separation of South and North Korea seems to have been destined by power politics. From the establishment of the US-Soviet Joint Committee in Seoul in March 1946 to the passage of the seven resolutions by the UN General Assembly on November 14 last year, there was little harmonious atmosphere between the US and the Soviet Union, but the geographical division between the North and the South was deepened. After the adoption of the UN resolution, the Soviet Union refused to cooperate; the work of the Korean Committee established in accordance with the UN resolution in South Korea was even met with contempt by North Korea, placing the representatives of the committee in an embarrassing situation. The committee initially wanted to harmonize the North and South Korean factions, but later fully supported South Korea, and even became a campaign team for the South Korean election on May 10. The parliament of South Korea, with the support of Syngman Rhee and Kim Seong-soo, etc., is going to establish a conservative government, and its diplomatic purpose is to be pro-American. The North Korean constitution has already been completed. According to Kim Il-sung's political line, the government to be established through general elections is a communist government, and its internal and foreign affairs are completely dictated by the Soviet Union. Under these two extreme situations, the middle factions such as Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik are in the most tragic situation. On the one hand, they are saddened by the tragedy of the division of their motherland and intend to reverse the situation, and on the other hand, they lack the open and aboveboard attitude of politicians. They still cannot help but follow the trend and turn to the North Korean forces. Some people say that the left turn of Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, etc., is a failure of the US rule in Korea. Recently, the United States has felt the distress of being in a dilemma in its policy towards Korea, all of which are errors caused by adopting a passive policy towards Korea and the Far East.</p>
<p>The so-called South Korea is the area south of the 38th parallel north latitude on the Korean Peninsula; this area accounts for two-thirds of the total Korean population, and most of its production relies on food. The only armed force in South Korea is a 30,000-strong police force and 23,000 US troops. The US military occupies South Korea, spending nearly 250 million US dollars a year, which is paying a heavy price to defend this half of the straight intestine. The United States is indeed temporarily considering a way to withdraw from South Korea. As long as the US-Soviet relations improve, the United States will inevitably withdraw from South Korea. As for North Korea, it is the area north of the 38th parallel north latitude on the Korean Peninsula, which is larger than South Korea, but the population accounts for only one-third of the total Korean population. It also has most of Korea's industries and produces the electricity needed for the country. North Korea is very well-armed and can have a 125,000-strong People's Communist Army, supported by 50,000 Soviet troops, with well-trained troops and strong weapons. If we compare the strength of North and South Korea, once something happens, the US army's position in Korea, which is far from being outnumbered, will be extremely fragile. The United States handed over the responsibility of defending South Korea to the UN Committee to replace the US military government, which is very different from the policy towards Japan, indicating the weakness and retrogression of the US policy towards Korea. As a result, the weaker the US policy, the more Korean political parties turn to North Korea. North Korea takes one step forward, and South Korea takes two steps back. The failure of the US ruling policy in South Korea is almost a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Looking at the trend, the division of Korea into North and South is unavoidable. The emergence of two governments means that a civil war similar to that in Greece is almost approaching Korea. From the 11th and 12th of this month, it shows that the short-handed encounter between the two Koreas is already on the string. In short, the evolution and development of this situation will be extremely unfavorable to the peace of China and the Far East. Therefore, we want to call the attention of US and Soviet politicians: they should be responsible for the division of Korea and the performance of the Korean tragedy. The fire on the Greek Peninsula was not set by the Greeks, but by the powers holding spears who burned the historical, civilized, and material civilizations of Greece. The current situation in Korea is the same as the crisis in Greece. It is not the 30 million Korean people who will destroy Korea and burn Korea, but the powerful who talk about geopolitics, military strategies, and situations!</p>

<h3>Security Council Issues New Ceasefire Order, Condemning Holy Land War Threatens Peace; Arab and Jewish Sides Prepare to Accept Unconditionally</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Security Council tonight approved the U.S. resolution by roll-call vote. It calls for the Arab and Jewish sides to cease hostilities within three days. The Security Council approved the nine-point resolution section by section, but the final approval awaits a vote on the entire resolution. Representatives from nine countries voted in favor of the provision to cease hostilities within three days. Syria voted against, and Argentina abstained. The section on the threat to peace posed by the situation in Palestine was approved by a roll-call vote of eight to one, with two abstentions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations Security Council passed a proposal tonight ordering the Arab and Jewish sides in Palestine to cease hostilities within three days. In Jerusalem, an unconditional ceasefire must be implemented within 24 hours. The new ceasefire order is stricter than previous resolutions. Any party, Arab or Jewish, that disregards this order will be seen as disrupting world peace. In that case, the Security Council must immediately consider various measures to implement the ceasefire order. The new resolution also stipulates that the United Nations mediator, Count Bernadotte, will supervise the ceasefire and continue to mediate between the Arab and Jewish sides. Soviet representative Malik expressed opposition, believing that Bernadotte was attempting to undermine the partition plan. British representative Jebb stated that the Security Council should pay full attention to Arab complaints about the unfair implementation of the previous truce agreement. While Britain supported the U.S. proposal, it did not recognize the Arabs as aggressors.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Reports from Cairo and Tel Aviv indicate that both the Arab and Jewish sides are expected to accept unconditionally the new ceasefire order passed by the Security Council, which will take effect on Sunday night. This is a significant boost for the frequently criticized prestige of the United Nations. The Arab League has reportedly notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations that it may not be able to implement a truce in the Jerusalem area starting tomorrow, but Israel has ordered its commander in the Jerusalem area to begin an indefinite truce within twelve hours. When news of the ceasefire resolution passed by the Security Council reached Arab capitals, the public was agitated. Students in Cairo marched in opposition to accepting the truce, chanting "Down with America." However, high-level authorities clearly intended to comply with the Security Council resolution. Arab League Secretary-General Azzam acknowledged at a press conference that Arab countries had no choice but to accept the truce to avoid sanctions. Jews in Tel Aviv cheered upon hearing the news, viewing it as a complete hope for peace. Meanwhile, Count Bernadotte has prepared to leave Lake Success and return to Palestine to supervise the implementation of the new truce. British representative Jebb stated that in the current difficult stage of the Palestine issue, hesitant steps would be a fatal blow to the entire international peace mechanism. U.S. representative Jessup expressed hope that this truce would not be wasted again to avoid losing this last opportunity. The Egyptian representative declined to comment pending instructions from Cairo. A British Foreign Office spokesperson acknowledged that the renewed ceasefire had brought optimistic hope but felt that a lot of work was still needed to sort out the entire issue.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union May Further Blockade Austrian Capital</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] According to information revealed on the 15th, Western countries are currently studying the possibility of the Soviet Union following the example of Berlin and ordering restrictions on traffic in the Vienna area of ​​Austria. Authoritative sources said that if the Soviet Union suddenly did this, the United States, Britain, and France "would not be surprised." Although Vienna is also under the control of the four powers, it is located deep within the Soviet occupation zone, mirroring Berlin. Some Western diplomats believe that when the Soviet Union rejected the Western protest against the blockade of Berlin, it brought with it威, or will take the same measures against Vienna. It is pointed out that the Soviet Union's reply to the three countries said that the Soviet Union "studied" the Truman-Stalin exchange of letters in June 1945 and believed that "the British, American and French troops could only enter德京 Berlin and 奥京 Vienna, and everyone knew that it was the Soviet army that captured these two cities."

Although the spokesperson did not reveal the content of the new action, he said that it will be a further step than the protest.

By Monday, the three Western powers will definitely be able to make a decisive joint new posture.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] There is still no sign of what strategy the three Western countries will use to break the Berlin blockade. However, it is said that the highest authorities in Washington, London, and Paris are considering the following steps: (1) Send a new note to Moscow, refuting the Soviet Union's reasons item by item. (2) Take retaliatory measures against the Soviets elsewhere in the world, such as the Soviets in Japan are all under American control. (3) The three countries can also economically sanction Soviet trade.

<h3>President Truman's Message to Congress, Calling for a Special Session of Congress; Republicans Said This Move is Purely Political in Nature</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Most Republicans were angry on the 15th at President Truman's request to convene a special parliamentary session on July 26.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman returned to the White House today and immediately, with the "national interest" as the top priority, formally requested Congress to convene a special meeting on the 26th of this month. The Republican Party scoffed at it as a kind of "downward policy", "借尸还魂" and "trickery".</p>
<p>Some Democratic councillors also expect that the meeting may not be successful. Others called it a positive action. This special meeting can be regarded as an unexpected gain for the Democratic Party convention, or it can determine this year's presidential election campaign. However, Du's political enemies also have no weak opportunities to speak in Congress, and Congress can still pass various bills that the president opposes. At the time when Congress is adjourned, the people across the country feel that holding a special meeting is of no avail. According to Democratic Vice President candidate Barkley, the president's decision is brave and justified, while Republican Senate Speaker Vandenberg said that this is the last gasp of the full-term government, which is entirely due to political action.</p>
<h3>The American Third Party is About to Hold a General Assembly</h3>

<h3>U.S. and British Pacific Fleets to Hold Joint Exercises; British Headquarters to Move from Hong Kong to Singapore Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 16th] Seven warships of the British Pacific Fleet, led by Commander-in-Chief Bowyer, will sail to Japan at the lower side to participate in exercises with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Bowyer's flagship is the Ten Thousand Smooth Patrol Ship "London", and the other ships are the Ten Thousand Smooth Patrol Ship "Sussex", the destroyers "苏克", "康斯登斯", "柯莫斯", "康 特" and "哈特". Bowyer will take the opportunity to bid farewell to the Allied leaders in Japan, as the headquarters of the British Pacific Fleet will be moved from Hong Kong to Singapore at the end of August. According to the Daily Chronicle, the official organ of the Soviet Military Government General 文机, Soviet aviation experts believe that the scope of the air corridor from West Germany to Berlin is too wide, and the Soviet authorities have decided to restrict flights in the corridor to ensure safety. Germans close to the Soviet Military Government said that the漏洞 mentioned by the Soviet political official is the air response between Berlin and West Germany. According to the German political official, "After the Western countries received the Soviet reply, no matter what action they take, the Soviet Union's policy towards Berlin will never change. It would be a big mistake to think that the Soviet reply meant that Moscow was willing to discuss the German issue with the four powers. Western powers are willing to hold such negotiations, and the Soviet Union may agree, but the Soviet Union will never take the initiative. The real meaning of the Soviet Lingwen is that the request to lift the blockade has been definitively rejected. Early full Soviet control of Berlin has a significant impact on the Soviet Union, just as the maintenance of the Soviet Union's power in the Balkans and its control over the Tartar Nair reflect on the Soviet Union's policy in the same way. Berlin is the center of Western European political, economic, and transportation, and it must be controlled by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will never relax its efforts to force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin. Sokolovsky has brought Stalin's latest instructions from Moscow and will strictly implement them. The hasty discussions currently underway in Western countries will not affect the Soviet Union's policy in Germany, because the Soviet Union's policy in Germany has long been definitively determined."</p>

<h3>Moscow Plans to Implement Severe Sanctions Against Yugoslav Communist Leaders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dispatch from London, March 15th] London diplomatic sources are convinced that Moscow has abandoned all hope of overthrowing or reforming Marshal Tito at the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress next Wednesday and has therefore begun planning to impose severe sanctions on Yugoslav Communist leaders. Today's communiqué, published in the capital of Romania by the Cominform, contained scathing attacks on the four leading Yugoslav Communists, stating that the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress, convened under a reign of terror, cannot be considered to represent the true opinions of party members. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union and the Cominform's actions to impose sanctions on the Yugoslav Communist leaders are not far off.</p>

<h3>Soldiers Cause Trouble at Two Theaters; Grenade Attack Causes 21 Deaths and Injuries; 23 Suspects Arrested and Transferred to Garrison Headquarters After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Incidents of soldiers causing disturbances at theaters have been occurring frequently lately. Although the authorities have repeatedly tried to prevent them, the situation has actually become more serious. Last night, the Grand Theater on Jiujiang Road and the Gong Stage on Zhongzheng East Road, two major Peking opera theaters, were once again the scenes of soldiers from passing troops gathering to cause trouble due to not being able to watch the performances, even throwing several hand grenades, resulting in a tragic incident with more than a dozen deaths and injuries. A dispute also occurred at the Golden Grand Theater on Jinling East Road, but it was quickly resolved. When the hand grenades exploded at the Grand Theater and the Gong Stage, many passersby were unfortunately injured, and the audience was greatly frightened. After the incident, military police and police flying squads maintaining order arrived upon hearing the news and arrested 23 soldiers who caused the trouble at the two locations. They were interrogated by the First Battalion of the Military Police Regiment this morning and transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling.</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM last night, after the evening performance at the Grand Theater began, more than 20 soldiers from a passing youth army, led by Ma Chi and Xia Jie, came and demanded free admission to watch the performance. The resident military police and theater inspector Xia Xiongzhang informed them that the regulations for entertaining soldiers were on Sundays, and free admission was not allowed at other times. The soldiers left unhappily. About 40 minutes later, they gathered 60-70 people and, led by Ma Chi and others, returned to the theater to force their way inside. The military police quickly stopped them. While the two sides were arguing at the theater entrance, someone among the rioting soldiers threw a hand grenade, which exploded loudly on the sidewalk east of the gate. Dong Xing, a 31-year-old electrician from Ningbo, was watching an advertisement there and was killed on the spot. In addition, the shrapnel injured theater employees Liu Jinfa, Fan Hengda, Fan Xianzhang, Chen Yungeng, Wu Xijiu, and passersby Tan Kexiang, Pan Lichang, Chen Xinhuang, Chen Wensheng, Chen Ruiyou, Sun Hongwei, Xu Zhengshi, Sun Gui, Chen Rubao, Feng Kerong, Zhu Lilihong, Sun Xikang, and others. There was chaos as people screamed and fled. The Old Gate Branch Bureau received the report and dispatched officers led by Chief Zhao to the scene. The garrison brigade and military police also sent troops to the scene, but the soldiers who caused the trouble had already scattered, and only one suspect, Soldier Sun Deming of the 202nd Division, was arrested. The dead and injured were immediately taken to Renji Hospital.</p>
<p>The incident at the Grand Theater had just come to an end when another incident occurred at the Gong Stage at 10:45 PM. The theater was staging the White Snake Legend last night. After the performance began, soldiers from the Youth Army and other passing troops entered the theater one after another, and almost all the back row seats were occupied by them. Near the end of the performance, dozens of Youth Army soldiers wanted to enter the theater to watch the performance. The theater staff refused them entry because the seats were full and the performance was about to end. Unexpectedly, they forcibly pried open the iron gate and rushed in. Fearing that trouble would arise, the theater urgently telegraphed the military and police authorities. The military police and garrison personnel and police flying squads maintaining order at the Grand Theater were ordered to transfer to the Gong Stage. When they arrived, the play had ended, and the audience was exiting through the emergency exits on both sides. When the soldiers in the theater saw the military police arrive, they became greatly dissatisfied. Amid the boos, a loud bang suddenly came from the first seat in the seventh row. A soldier threw a hand grenade on the ground and it exploded. Yao Zhongfang (male) and Zhu Xianlan (female), two spectators nearby, were injured by the shrapnel. Other spectators who had not yet left the theater were terrified and fled in panic. The military police immediately arrested the soldiers in the theater suspected of causing trouble. At that time, more than 280 soldiers who had watched the performance had gathered outside the theater gate, and some had retreated into the Great World through the emergency exit. In the chaos, another hand grenade exploded in the Great World. To prevent the situation from escalating, the military police fired several shots into the air as a warning and maintained strict vigilance. Seeing that the situation was not in their favor, they dispersed reluctantly.</p>
<p>Among those arrested by the military police at the scene were Soldiers Xiang Guoying, Su Zongsheng, Tao Yunshu, Xiong Shaogui, Liu Xiaozhong, Liu Xiangyang, Huang Xinglong, Wu Guozheng, Chen Yumei, Chen Xianyi, Tan Dehua, Lin Guocheng, Wu Jichang, Li Xiangying of the Youth Army Independent Brigade, Staff Sergeant Wang Lexiang of the Armored Headquarters Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office, soldier Dong of the Youth Army 208th Division, soldier Yu Mingfang of the 21st Reorganized Division, as well as soldier Wei Yufu of the Tongshan Regiment Area arrested in front of the Gong Stage, Cai Aisheng, a member of the Jiading Militia, and Min of the Second Ordnance Depot of the Ministry of National Defense, and 22 others. Together with Sun Deming, arrested in front of the Grand Theater, they were all taken to the First Battalion of the Military Police on Fengyang Road at 11:30 PM. That night, they were interrogated in five groups by Battalion Adjutant Zou Li and others one by one. According to the confession of Youth Army soldier Tan Dehua, the companion who carried the hand grenade was bugler Yang Shuyun, but he had escaped in the chaos. The interrogation was completed at 1:00 AM this morning. The suspects, along with their written confessions, were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling.</p>
<p>When the incidents occurred, the theaters were extremely shocked. The Theater Guild planned to hold an emergency meeting at the Queen's Theater that night, but because the internal losses of the Grand Theater and the Gong Stage were still minor and it was already late, the meeting was rescheduled for today to discuss everything. It is also reported that the security authorities notified the commanders of various troops passing through Shanghai last night not to allow their subordinates to go out starting today.</p>
<p>[Another report] Last night, one hour after the incident at the Gong Stage, an injured soldier was admitted to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. He claimed to be Yang Shaoyun, and was injured by shrapnel from a hand grenade in the Great World. Because the injuries were quite serious, and his life was feared to be in danger, the hospital, out of caution, telegraphed the military police team. The team believed that this person's name was only one character different from the Yang Shuyun mentioned in Tan Dehua's confession, and suspected him of throwing the grenade. An investigation is currently underway. The military police arrested suspects at the Gong Stage and loaded them onto a garrison vehicle.

<h3>Those Helped Help Others; Dai Ciding Determined to Remember the Source of the Water; Responds to the Shenbao's Scholarship Campaign</h3>
<p>Over the years, the Shenbao's "Reader Scholarship Fund" has helped many poor students, allowing them to complete their expected course of study in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, these students may already be in society, beginning to contribute their academic abilities and serving the community.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter and a donation of 5 million yuan from a student who had previously received assistance from the Shenbao's "Reader Scholarship Fund." In his letter, he said:</p>
<p>"Editor: When I was in school, I was forced to drop out of school due to family financial difficulties, but the Shenbao's 'Reader Scholarship Fund' helped me, allowing me to avoid the misfortune of dropping out of school. Now I work in a government agency in Xuzhou, and my life is relatively stable. In order to thank you for the assistance you gave me in the past, I have saved 5 million yuan from my daily expenses and donated it to the scholarship fund to help poor students who are coming after me... Dai Ciding bowing"</p>
<p>Although 5 million yuan is not a large sum, remembering the source of the water contains boundless deep feelings!</p>
<p>I hope that every reader can embrace the mentality of feeling the hunger and drowning of others, donate more, so that the "Reader Scholarship Fund" can be launched smoothly!</p>

<h3>Preliminary Court Hearing of the Dance Hall Riot Case - Defendants All Claimed They Didn't Use Violence - Reporters Will Be Called as Witnesses; Trial May Conclude Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday presented the tensest situation since the start of the student movement trials. Eighty-three dance hall employees were accused of threatening to destroy the Social Affairs Bureau because of the ban on dancing. Except for Tang Zongjie, Hu Yunyuan, Yang Lili, and six others who were investigated by the District Attorney's Office, but found insufficient evidence, and Zhang Mao Mao, who was under fourteen years old, who was not prosecuted but instead called as a witness outside the court, the remaining seventy-three, including Zhu , were all prosecuted for obstructing official duties. Yesterday, the District Court increased the number of armed bailiffs for special security. The seating arrangements for reporters from various newspapers once caused a minor disturbance.</p>
<p>Judge Zhong Dada announced the opening of the court at 9:05 a.m. First, Li Jianying, the Chief of the Songshan Road Police Station who was present at the scene, testified about witnessing the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau. Then, the court successively summoned dance hostesses Rong Yingfeng, You Lingling, and Jin Ying, a prospective dance hostess who shouted "Show Courage!" at the Social Affairs Bureau (Jin Ying once claimed to be a female student and said she was persuaded by her "little sisters" to become a dance hostess, but she did not have a dance hostess license). All three defendants denied the statements they made at the police station. Afterwards, all the defendants claimed that they arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau after 4 p.m. and denied having destroyed anything. The police officers who were present at the scene testified yesterday that since so much time had passed, their memories of the faces of those who destroyed things were vague and they could not identify them. Only Zhang Maosheng, an employee of the Social Affairs Bureau, testified that Luo Ying, a dance hostess from the Victory Dance Hall, removed the wooden sign from the secretary's office and used it to smash glass and other objects. Luo Ying herself testified that she did not use violence and was arrested that day because her hair was disheveled.</p>
<p>Four Principles for Detaining Suspects</p>
<p>The members of the Flying Fortress Team who testified yesterday mostly said that at the time, they arrested suspects based on the four principles given by their superiors: (1) those with mud on their hands and feet; (2) those whose clothes were torn; (3) those with wounds on their faces; (4) those with disheveled hair. However, the defendants said that they were arrested mostly because they did not have their national identity cards or employee membership cards.</p>
<p>In the morning, a total of thirty-seven defendants were questioned before the court temporarily adjourned.</p>
<p>The trial resumed at 2 p.m. Zhu Fei, the most suspected person, was the first to be questioned. Zhu Fei had stated at the police station that a misunderstanding occurred in front of the Social Affairs Bureau due to the petition, leading to a crowd rushing in and destroying office items upstairs, vividly describing the situation. Other defendants also testified that they saw Zhu Fei destroying things. In court yesterday, Zhu Fei overturned his original statement, saying that at the police station, he could not bear to see the other defendants being tortured, so he stepped forward to confess. He elaborately said that his two statements contradicted each other. Judge Zhong refuted this, stating that the two statements were consistent and there were no contradictions. Zhu frequently said: "This is not the truth."</p>

<p>The person in the center is dance hostess Jin Meihong. (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>Sun Zhimin Used Photos as Evidence</p>
<p>Jin Meihong, Sun Zhimin, and Meng Yan, who were elected as representatives of the presidium at the meeting in New Wonderland, all said that they did not conspire to destroy anything and did not express any opinions during the meeting. Cha Ruili and Yang Lili, who separately testified that they saw Sun Zhimin and Meng Yan go to the second floor of the Social Affairs Bureau, were both denied by Sun and Meng as being acquaintances. Jin Meihong also testified that she tried her best to dissuade the crowd from rioting and said that a photo published in the Shen Bao could prove this. The questioning of all the defendants was completed at 3:40 p.m. At 9:30 a.m. this morning, the trial will resume in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court. More than twenty lawyers will展开辩论, and reporters and photographers who were present at the scene on the day of the incident will be called to testify. The trial may conclude tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Sidelines of the Opening of the Dance Hall Riot Trial</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening of the dance hall riot trial at the District Court drew dozens of relatives of the dance hall employees to the court to listen. Relatives without admission tickets gathered at the entrance of the District Court, peering in, reminiscent of entering a deeply guarded mansion.</p>
<p>A special feature of yesterday's trial was that witnesses, including members of the Flying Fortress Team and employees of the Social Affairs Bureau, gave identical answers to questions about which dance hall employees destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, saying that because time had passed and clothing had changed, they could not accurately identify them. The defendant dance hall employees generally said "I don't know," "I didn't know," "I didn't hit anyone" to the judge's questions.</p>
<p>Inside and Outside the Iron Bars - Two Different Appearances</p>
<p>The detained employees among the defendants all had hair past their ears and were shabbily dressed. Those who were released on bail still had their hair styled and shiny. Dance hostesses, whether detained or released on bail, were all simple and unadorned, without makeup.</p>
<p>Hong Xiaoping, a dance hostess who was not prosecuted, arrived at the court in full dress to listen, wearing Crome limited glasses, looking quite elegant. In the audience, she frequently greeted lawyers and her sisters in distress.</p>
<p>Qin Xianfen, who was released on bail, wore thick nearsighted glasses, looking more like an innocent female student than a dance hostess. According to her statement, the reason for her arrest was that a woman wearing glasses was seen hitting people and destroying property, but it was not her.</p>
<p>By noon, only half of the seventy-three defendants had been questioned. Everyone present was hungry, and a humorous note was passed in the lawyers' section: "Today is the opening of the dance hostess trial. Those attending the voluntary defense should be treated to lunch by the Shanghai Women's Association."</p>
<h3>Minor Incident in Court - Reporters Compete for Seats</h3>
<p>The District Court opened yesterday with strict security, restricting photographers from taking flash photos and placing reporters' seats next to the audience seats, far away from the judge's bench, making it difficult to cover the trial. All the reporters withdrew in protest. Later, Huang Yanju, the Chief Clerk of the Court, came forward to mediate and agreed to allow reporters to take photos as usual in the court and moved their seats closer to the lawyers' section. With this, the minor incident was resolved.</p>

<h3>Lobotomy (II) - New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>[By airmail from Qingdao, 12th of this month] He made a forced analogy: "It's like having four wires through which electricity flows; now, if you cut off one or two wires, the electricity can still continue to flow." He continued: "Some physiologists do not differentiate between regions of the frontal lobe of the brain, and regard the entire part as the spiritual master, but in fact, the extent of frontal lobectomy is more important than the area being removed!" Therefore, he said: We can think that mental illness is very likely the result of an abnormal frontal lobe synthesis capacity or an abnormal transmission connection in the frontal lobe.</p>
<p>Dr. Liu Mingduo quoted and selected the research results of general scholars. He mentioned that in 1936, 之Noniz used frontal lobectomy to treat a patient whose diagnosis was unclear, and the result was very good. Since then, brain surgeons have followed suit and tried it on epilepsy and schizophrenia, with particularly significant effectiveness for catatonia. Therefore, the reasons for using frontal lobectomy to treat schizophrenia and epilepsy may be due to: (1) changes in blood flow, (2) changes in lymph circulation, (3) changes in the transmission route, etc. When epilepsy occurs, the blood vessels are surrounded by glial cells, thus causing vasospasm and causing anemia, which is the real reason for seizures. Some scholars explain that patients with mental illness often have abnormal movements due to illusions and hallucinations. Yes, these hallucinations and illusions are due to the abnormal interaction of the patient's previous experiences and knowledge. If this abnormal interaction is relaxed, the illusions and hallucinations can be eliminated immediately.</p>
<p>"And frontal lobectomy can accomplish this task." He concluded: "So this is beneficial for patients with mental illness." Therefore, "most brain surgeons currently advocate using frontal lobectomy to treat patients with schizophrenia, mental illness with hallucinations, agitated mental illness, and severe pain caused by untreatable diseases such as cancer. They particularly advocate using lobectomy for patients with schizophrenia who are not effectively treated with insulin shock and electroshock."</p>
<p>"However," he also said: "This surgery is still in the experimental stage. As far as I know, there are still very few cases with results after surgery."</p>

<h3>Four Salt Police Officers in Jinshanwei Forcibly Purchased Rice Straw and Assaulted People</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Jinshan, 14th of this month] The third squadron of the salt police stationed in the west gate of Jinshanwei city has always had local people provide straw at low prices, and salt police officers often forcibly purchase straw and give extremely low prices. The villagers carrying straw all regard the west gate as a dangerous place. On the 10th of this month, four police officers from the salt police squadron went to the home of Ma Quansheng, a resident of Xicang in the seventh bao, to purchase . Quansheng's mother first gave them one load, but the salt police officers wanted to more than fill the gap and insisted on buying two loads. When Gao's mother argued slightly, she was escorted to the salt field office and brutally beaten. When her son Quansheng heard the news, he went to request her release. The four salt police officers then hung up Quansheng and his brother's wife and beat them. The town's militia learned of the incident and requested the release of Gao Quansheng's mother and brother's wife, but the salt police's attitude was tough. They immediately gathered police officers, armed with guns and live ammunition, as if facing a formidable enemy. Fortunately, Liu Zhi, the captain of the second security mountain team of the county, came forward to mediate, and the salt battalion finally agreed to release Gao and the other four. However, they were covered in salt injuries and their lives were at risk. It is said that they have already requested justice from the local public opinion organs.</p>

<h3>Strange Customer at a Restaurant in Hangzhou - Eats a Full Meal and Doesn't Pay - Willing to Give Away Six-Year-Old Daughter - Officer Teng Generously Helps with Travel Expenses</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Hangzhou, 15th] A tragic incident occurred in Hangzhou on the 14th at noon, involving a man exchanging his daughter for a meal. Xie Yaohui from Ganzhou, Jiangxi, brought his six-year-old daughter to Duoyichu Restaurant on Yanling Road for lunch, consuming over 1.3 million yuan worth of food. When the waiter asked for payment, Xie claimed he had no money and offered to give his daughter to the restaurant unconditionally. The restaurant staff criticized him for ordering food when he had no money. Xie argued that he had raised his daughter to the age of six, and giving her away for a full meal was not excessive. The restaurant, considering his unreasonable argument, took him to the Second Branch Bureau. Xie confessed: He is 33 years old, a retired military officer. Seven years ago, after getting married, he had this daughter, named Xiaofu, who is now six years old. After retiring from the military after the victory of the war against Japan, he was unemployed for many years. His wife, unable to endure hardship, eloped with a general-level officer, leaving him and his daughter to depend on each other. He arrived in Hangzhou from Ganzhou five days ago, staying at Lake View Hotel No. 18. He had run out of travel funds and was penniless. Therefore, he planned to give his daughter away and go to Shanghai alone to seek work. The bureau, recognizing his situation, released him after he wrote a letter of repentance. An officer named Teng at the bureau also donated 500,000 yuan for his travel expenses.</p>

<h3>Floating Capital Enters Various Markets - Prices Once Again Rise Across the Board</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After two days of stability, prices in this city rose across the board again yesterday. Prices of cotton cloth, rice, and daily necessities all increased by more than 10%. According to analysis by relevant sources, the main reasons for the price rebound are as follows: (1) A batch of floating capital from North China, estimated at around 4 trillion, which had previously been frozen, has now entered the market. (2) The Four Banks yesterday approved production loans for cooperative enterprises, amounting to about 3 trillion, which will be disbursed within days. (3) The cost of living index released the day before rose by nearly 100%, affecting the cost of factories and indirectly stimulating the prices of daily necessities.</p>
<p>Hua stocks experienced another all-around surge yesterday afternoon. Yongsha was sold at an additional 700 yuan after hitting the daily price limit. Due to floating capital, the price of cotton cloth rose, and hoarding was rampant. Stockholders were reluctant to sell, and the market soared, with Longtou fine cloth approaching the 4,000 mark. Due to firm rice prices in Wuxi and no further price drops, coupled with easing credit, stockholders were reluctant to sell easily, and the prices of all grades of rice rose universally, with top-grade white rice exceeding 30 million. Other daily necessities all rose due to the increase in the cost of living index and factories adjusting their wages.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the black market interest rates in this city were unprecedentedly high yesterday. The black market interest rate for cotton yarn once reached as high as 1,400 yuan per thousand, and the stock market interest rate also reached as high as 900 yuan per thousand. The general market interest rate was 5 jiao, and the interbank day loan interest rate also reached as high as 3 jiao. However, although interest rates were high, prices still rose, which shows that people are optimistic about the market, and merchants are willing to borrow at high interest rates to purchase goods. This is a characteristic of the current price surge and may indirectly indicate an impending economic crisis.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Uniformly - White Jing and Bo Dao Return to the 30 Million Mark</h3>
<p>The rice market rebounded again due to rising quotations in Wuxi and the overall increase in prices of other goods. Although credit was tight, stockholders held firm on prices. Prices rose by 2 million yuan in the early market, but some stockholders, unable to withstand the pressure of tight funds, sold more goods at the close, leading to a slight pullback, but still an increase of about 1.5 million yuan. At the North City Market, Jing Bo Dao and Yang Xian all returned to the 30 million mark, with special-grade Gao Jing reaching 33 million. At the South City Market, Songjiang Bo Shao was 30 million, Bai Yin Yuan was 30 million, and crude Xian rice mills still had strong demand, adding 1 to 2 million. 4,369 stones of goods arrived at the two markets.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous grains All-round soaring, under the agitation of rising rice prices and other goods in the circle, people's hearts were very firm. Due to high prices in Hankou and large exchange water, the price of yellow beans was not suitable for planning, and the seller was very light. The opening price of Zha beans was 14.5 million, and then the price of oil cakes rose, and then increased by 1 million, and the closing was tired. The corn rose by 3 million, the Qing Gang Naxi took, and the clumsy beans added a million. The Yuan wheat North Gang had an office, which was up 2 million. The green bean sales were very dull, slightly increasing by 1 million, and the sesame seed was raised by 2 to 3 million. The raw benevolence was absorbed by the Guangdong Gang, and jumped up by 5 to 6 million.</p>
<p>Edible oil Continued to rise, due to the consistent rise in raw materials such as soybeans, and the overall increase in the price of other goods, the scattered households were strong, and the suction was very strong. Although the oil factory has opened, it is still in short supply. The opening price of soybean oil increased by 10%, which was 66 million.

<p>Regarding the number of cotton production loans that the China Farmers Bank will hold in Jiangsu Province this year, the acreage, the amount of output, and the lending standards and methods are of great concern to the general public.

<h3>Stagnation of Fur Exports - The Industry Makes Two Major Demands</h3>
<p>At present, China's fur industry has encountered a severe crisis, especially on the export side, where losses are too great, and merchants generally regard the foreign market as a path of fear. There are two reasons for this situation: (1) The legal exchange rate of the national currency against the US dollar is too low. Although there is a certificate price, it is almost half the price of the black market foreign exchange. Moreover, farmers' thinking is stubborn, and they use rice prices as a measure. Before the war, a pair of yellow wolves could be exchanged for one stone of white rice, but now they can only be exchanged for five dou, so they try to increase the selling price as much as possible, which affects the export quantity. (2) After the Foreign Exchange Audit Office of the Central Bank promulgated the measures for the settlement of foreign exchange for consignment exports, it has severely hit the consignment method adopted in recent years. As fur is subject to seasonality, if the exchange settlement is limited to a certain period, merchants cannot actively strive for normal market prices. At the moment, the industry hopes that the government can implement a fur export self-defense program. (1) The method of limiting the settlement of foreign exchange to three months should be revised, and it is hoped that the deadline will be extended as much as possible. (2) The price of the certificate must be increased so that the exchange rate of the foreign exchange obtained can adapt to the price and cost of living index.</p>
<h3>Cash Shortage in Southwest Provinces</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoliang Asks for Prompt Restoration of Printing Plant</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Chongqing, 16th] Zhu Shaodao telegraphed Wang Shijie, Minister of Finance, on the 16th, saying that the number of cash needed in the southwestern provinces is very large. If they rely solely on Shanghai's transportation, it is feared that it will be too late. The Chongqing market is currently in turmoil due to a severe shortage of cash.

It is proposed that the funds for the approved restoration of the printing plant in Chongqing be allocated in advance and established quickly to relieve the cash shortage in the southwestern provinces. He also telegraphed President Yu of the Central Bank to allow the Chongqing Central Bank to fill out banknotes as cash to turn over, and then recover them after the cash arrives. According to a report from the Chongqing Central Bank, the Chongqing market needs 250 billion cash per day, and the situation in July is special, with an additional 6 trillion yuan needed.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Market Shows a Promising Trend - Fine Yarn Price Jumps by 200 Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was favorable due to the environment and the revitalization of non-industry materials. The hearts of the people suddenly became firm, and the Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, and Guangdong gangs, as well as new buyers and short covering, all rose together. The market was full of buying interest, but the money supply was still tight, and most transactions were for next-day funds. The initial opening of 42s Blue Phoenix jumped to around 150 million. Later, the price rose again as the stockholders held firm. At the near close, those who were squeezed by funds slightly sold off, and finally ended at 1.65 billion yuan, rebounding 200 million yuan from the previous day. Next-day delivery also squeezed up 150 million yuan. Due to the large supply and sale of 21s Double Horse yarn, the current exit rebounded 190 million, and the tomorrow exit was up 140 million. The remaining various counts of coarse and fine yarns also increased by 1-200 million or more. Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation was due to the sharp increase in the index, the increased cost of manufacturers, the imminent issuance of large banknotes, and the raging dust. Although the money supply was still secretly tight, the rumors of floating capital arriving in Shanghai were circulating, and the Sichuan, Han, Hunan, and Tianjin gangs all absorbed it, and new buying and hoarding were active, and the stockholders took the opportunity to turn the price, and the market suddenly became strong.</p>
<p>The initial call price of Longtou fine cloth was 37 million yuan. Later, due to the secret absorption of financial gangs, it gradually rose to the 40 million mark. The search was very short, and finally ended at 39.5 million yuan, a squeeze of about 15% compared to the previous day. Five blessings, blue chickens, trumpets, children, and other grades of fine cloth also rebounded by 1-20% or more. In addition, bib cloth, coarse cloth, and color cloth and shilin cloth also flourished in the market.

<p>Also, yesterday, cotton was sold as usual, and there were still few enquirers. Only 50 dans were sold, and each was 280 million. It will be sold today. Also, Zhongfang yesterday sold 245 pieces of cotton yarn on behalf of the yarn tube association in the market, recovering 29,481,000,000 yuan. Another 810 pieces were auctioned, recovering 106.15 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of cotton distribution in Wuxi yarn mills</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The yarn tube association has spread that the cotton stock of Wuxi factories is insufficient. Yesterday, the spokesperson actually stated: "The Wuxi factories that have successively signed contracts with the association to handle cotton distribution and yarn exchange include Tiantong, Gongtai, and Xinyi. The ones that are approved by the association to issue cotton purchase certificates and decorated with their own purchases include Dehua, Tianyuan, Yuankang, and Zhenxin. Recently, Jinxin has applied to the association for cotton distribution, and the investigation procedures are being handled. Another Qingfeng was approved for distribution the month before, but more than half a month has passed, and they have not come to the meeting to handle the signing procedures, and have automatically given up. From this, it can be seen that the shortage of cotton stock in the factories in the area may not be as rumored. However, the wood association has a supply plan for the cotton used by each yarn factory, and has ordered the six district associations to report the number of cotton stocks and cotton used by each member factory in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Also, since Wang Lansen, acting chairman of the yarn tube association, has been in charge of the association, he is determined to carry out reforms. He has sent a letter to Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and intends to transfer Ma Lianfang, a specialist commissioner from the ministry, to the association as the deputy director of the transportation department.</p>

The younger students and those with less serious involvement, who were evacuated on the 15th, have all been taken home by their parents. It is reported that one or two key instigators are still occupying Huize Building, but they have lost their leadership. This student unrest, which has turned sour, may end within days.</p>
<h3>National Treasury Bureau Approves Advance for Living Allowance</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The National Treasury Bureau of the National Government has stated that the monthly adjustments to the living allowances for central government agencies in various regions require the Ministry of Finance to submit a table of regional standards for the payment of living allowances for each month before the Bureau can forward the funds. The past forwarding process has often been delayed. To facilitate processing, sub-treasuries may temporarily approve advances from the treasury funds (i.e., general special deposits) for the agencies, based on reports and newspaper articles from the Central News Agency regarding regional payment standards for the living index or living allowance for civilian and military personnel, as well as related regulations that are to be adjusted, pending formal notification. After formal notification is received, the advanced amounts will be deducted accordingly, balancing both needs. Instructions on this method have been sent to all branch offices for their information and action.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Responds to Shaanxi Education Department: Establishment of County High Schools to be Postponed; Local Education Funds Should be Massively Used for National Education</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education, in response to a telegram from the Shaanxi Education Department requesting instructions on whether county-level junior high schools should establish high school departments, discussed the matter in a departmental meeting.

<h3>Education Bureau's Qualification Review Temporarily Concludes; List for Secondary Schools Announced; Final Deadline Set for Four Universities</h3>

St. John's University and other schools requested the Education Bureau to forward a request to the Ministry of Education to simplify the qualification review procedures. Except for the Sino-French Private Shanghai College of Law and Business and the private music schools, which have already been registered by the Education Bureau, graduates from Soochow University, Zhejiang University, Shanghai College, and St. John's University have been approved to follow the simplified procedure, and the registration procedures will be handled by the respective schools on behalf of the graduates. The deadline for the qualification review of these specialized schools was originally set for the end of June, but because this is the last opportunity, it has been extended to the end of July. Graduates from these schools who have not yet completed the qualification review registration must complete the procedures at their respective schools within two weeks.</p>

<h3>From Public Order to Physical Assault and Verbal Abuse</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>In Shanghai, no one doesn't shake their head when public order is mentioned.</p>
<p>Let's start with the streets: When traffic police are on duty in the streets, pedicabs and "yellow cabs" proceed in order, albeit reluctantly and impatiently. But once these officers are off duty, all vehicles proceed side-by-side, chaotic and disordered.</p>
<p>Next to tram and bus stops, even under the supervision of armed military police, queues are sometimes impossible to form, because those who "physically assault" and "verbally abuse" are never restrained. Everyone probably remembers that right after the victory, some passengers on Shanghai trams were accustomed to climbing in through the windows and jumping out through the windows. Even today, there are those who demand that the vehicle stop before reaching the stop, and there are also cases of beating the driver and assaulting the ticket seller. In the past month, such disputes have been reported repeatedly in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Let's talk about theaters: After the victory, the authorities implemented a beneficial policy, which was that all theaters would assign seats. However, at the beginning of the implementation, many difficulties were encountered. Although the numbered seating system has now been successfully established, incidents of physical altercations in theaters due to some people's lack of orderliness seem to be extremely commonplace news.</p>
<p>As for the small number of ordinary citizens who are willing to abide by order, they mostly belong to the "weak minority". They certainly hate the breakdown of order, but they are also powerless to do anything about it, so they are also very good at "becoming accustomed to it". Nowadays, they especially seem unwilling to interfere. In the past, if someone smoked on a tram or in a theater, many others would come forward to boo him a few times or say a few words to show disapproval. This phenomenon has disappeared now. As for the good habit of giving up seats to women and children on trams, it has also become less common recently.</p>
<p>It is said that from August 1st, the "ban on spitting" will be strictly enforced, but in today's Shanghai, where there is "physical assault and verbal abuse," this measure is causing people to be nervously concerned that it might trigger a few more "three-legged iron rooster" performances.</p>
<p>Not long ago, an article by a foreign reporter said: "From Shanghai to Tokyo, it is like ascending from a chaotic world to a peaceful paradise." Is this statement excessive? Everyone should ask themselves!</p>
<h3>American Soldiers' Illegitimate Children Left Overseas</h3>
<p>— Kuan Nai</p>
<p>During World War II, the total number of illegitimate children born to American soldiers serving overseas with local women reached about 500,000. Except for a very small number who were able to reunite with their biological fathers, most of these children have been "forgotten".</p>
<p>Where have these children been left? A rough estimate is as follows: (1) North Africa, 5,000; (2) mainland Britain, 22,000; (3) Italy, 10,000; (4) Belgium, 5,000 in Brussels alone; (5) Germany, France, and Austria, a total of 63,000; (6) China, Japan, Australia, and other Far Eastern countries, a total of about 200,000.</p>
<p>The US government has not yet developed a specific plan to address this issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin formally stated in Parliament that "Britain had requested the US government to provide financial assistance to these illegitimate children of American soldiers left in Britain and their mothers, but ultimately no agreement could be reached." (This article is adapted from this month's "Reader's Digest").</p>
<h3>Clever Pigs</h3>
<p>— Song Pu</p>
<p>We often hear the insulting phrase: "You stupid pig!" In fact, that is wrong. Pigs are not necessarily all "stupid." Clever pigs are not few in number, but they have not been noticed by people all along. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Some hunters in the United States have domesticated and trained piglets to help people find truffles in the woods. They are called "hunting pigs."</p>
<p>The French often take pigs to the forest to find truffles and other fungi. These fungi are hidden deep in the roots of trees, and there is no sign of them from the ground. However, the pig's long nose can smell the fragrance. After sniffing it out, it will dig down with its nose. The person collecting the fungi must drive the pig away in time, otherwise the fragrant fungus will be eaten by the pig.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a famous pig in an American circus that could count the number of cards. The owner gave it a card printed with a number, and it would tap the ground with its front feet. The number of taps was always the same as the number on the card. Although the circus owner would make a signal, it is still a rare feat that it could know the number of times it was tapping.</p>
<h3>"Fake Newspapers"</h3>
<p>— Hai Si</p>
<p>Since the "fake newspaper" can satisfy at least two conditions, the film can become a real and complete historical document and an exciting story. One is that every piece of news must be consistent with its time period, and there must be no news about "atomic bombs" appearing in the background film, as that would violate the time period.</p>
<p>In order to meet these two conditions, Hayes has established a newspaper archive, collecting hundreds of newspapers from all over the world, the earliest of which was published in 1769. With this archive, he is able to coordinate the fake news needed in the film with the real news that occurred at the same time. For example, when he "edits" a "screen newspaper" with the death of the great thief John Dillinger as the headline, he inserts a picture of a flood in China in the newspaper, because both events happened in 1934.</p>
<p>However, because the audience never has time to read all the news other than the news that the director wants to convey, Hayes uses his newspaper archive to fill in the gaps, casually throwing in random fragments. Sometimes, the subtitles of two "screen newspapers" with different headlines are actually the same. Of course, the audience will not notice this "minor flaw".</p>
<p>Now, in addition to newspapers, Hayes's archive also contains more than 10,000 posters and phone books, hundreds of legal notices, and thousands of postcards. Upon receipt of a notice, he can immediately supply or compile an Irish horse racing ticket, a Mumbai menu, a medical diploma from 1840, or a sticker on a Greek wine bottle - and of course, the "screen newspaper".</p>

<p>With wine, I can complete the scene beyond the world, embracing the accumulated moss in the cold, empty mountain; from now on, I will no longer talk about the matter of harmonizing the soup, but only be happy with the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>I heard that a branch of plum blossoms is sold for a million coins, a strange thing in the world that is difficult to express in words; since spring colors are not abundant, they are only found in tall buildings and wide houses.</p>
<p>Titled on the old brush with the Korean name Bang Lang Guan engraved by Li, the artistic workshop of the Wang family is carefully made</p>
<p>When will the magic brush be used to spread the army's message? The fallen king has been homeless for a long time today! It is tragic to see Bang Lang become collapsed earth, and the blood-stained Jifeng is as chaotic as hemp.</p>
<h3>The Eighty-Two Year Old Hanlin Scholar Mr. Cao Shuyan</h3>
<p>— Shulu</p>
<p>The continuing of a marital bond of eighty-two year old Hanlin scholar Cao Yuanbi (Shuyan) of Wumen is a delightful story, and has been widely reported in newspapers both north and south. I read in the "Ling Xiaohan Pavilion Conversations" published in this newspaper on the 11th of this month a clarification of the title "Old Hanlin Scholar" applied to Cao, stating that one who passes the imperial examination but does not enter the Hanlin Academy should not be generally called a Hanlin scholar, and that people often do not distinguish between the two, which is indeed correct. However, Cao's being called a Hanlin scholar is not incorrect. According to records, Cao was a Jinshi in the Jiawu year of the Guangxu reign (the "Conversations" stating the Yiewei year is also an error). At that time, calligraphy was highly valued in the palace examination. Cao, due to a vision problem, could not write in proper regular script, so he was not included in the palace examination and was instead employed as a secretary in the Grand Secretariat. Later, in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu, Chen Qitai, the Governor of Jiangsu, submitted a memorial presenting Cao's early work "Annotations and Explanations of the Classics of Rituals," citing the precedent of Wang Weiyun who was awarded the title of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy by imperial decree for his book written as a Juren. Cao was also granted the title of Compiler of the Hanlin Academy by imperial edict, and the original book "Annotations and Explanations of the Classics of Rituals" was sent to the Ritual Studies Institute for study. Details are recorded in the Qing Veritable Records. Cao's second elder brother, Fuyuan, also served as a Compiler of the Hanlin Academy and later as the Circuit Intendant of Kaigui Zhengxu in Henan, acting as the Governor. Brothers both in the Hanlin Academy, their family was prominent and a respected clan in Wumen. (The eldest brother, Yuanheng, known as Mr. Cangzhou, was famous as a physician and was once summoned to diagnose the illness of Emperor Dezong of Qing. A cousin, Yuanzhong, served as a Reader in the Grand Secretariat and was known for his erudition, authoring works such as the "Jianjing Studio Collection," etc.) The "Conversations" only knew about his initial position but did not examine that he later obtained the distinguished Hanlin position. Furthermore, the "Conversations" stated that he was respected by famous public officials and dignitaries for his expertise in literary composition, textual research, bronze and stone inscriptions, and book editions, but did not mention Cao's profound knowledge of the classics, making him a prominent figure in the country. His published works include "Annotations and Explanations of the Classics of Rituals," "Explanations of Zheng's Commentary on the Zhou Yi," "Supplementary Corrections to the Collected Explanations of the Zhou Yi," "Annotations and Explanations of Zheng's Commentary on the Classic of Filial Piety," "Zhou Yi Studies," "Classics of Rituals Studies," "Collected Works of the Fuli Hall," and more than ten other works such as "Poetry on Learning," all beautifully written and meticulously carved, representing monumental works. Even at his advanced age of over eighty, he still diligently studies at his desk, writing "Annotations and Explanations of Zheng's Commentary on the Book of Documents," demonstrating his clear mind and serving as a spiritual beacon like the ancient Lu Palace. As for the matter of continuing his marital bond, it seems to be surprising, but it is not known that Cao is blind and had a close, lifelong friendship with Tang Wenzhi, and they suffered from the same illness. In his daily life, he needed constant support and care. Since the passing of Madam Wang, more than ten years ago, his cousin Zhang Hong (also known as a Jinshi and the author of "Sequel to the Flower in a Sinful Sea") from Changshu has accompanied him day and night. He originally had no intention of remarrying, but his cousin suddenly passed away this spring at the age of seventy, leaving him lonely and helpless, which led to this unprecedented decision. Therefore, Cao wrote in a letter to a friend, "Continuing the marital bond is a way to continue my life, and it is an innovative approach in the world," which shows his suffering. The writer lives near Cao's residence, so I know the details and record them to inform the readers.</p>
<h3>"Newspaperman" of the Film Capital</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>The next time you watch a Hollywood movie, if there is a close-up of a newspaper on the screen, please pay attention to the name of the newspaper. It is probably not one you are familiar with, and even Americans have never heard of it. This is true for every film.</p>
<p>To know the truth behind this, one should ask Er Hayes, the editor, publisher, and printer of these newspapers that only appear on the screen. Hayes is a lean, smiling printer who specializes in printing things for the screen. The newspapers, posters, advertisements, telegrams, menus, theater tickets, and legal notices used in various film studios are almost all handled by him alone.</p>
<p>When a newspaper is to appear on the screen, it must be fictional to avoid legal disputes that might arise from using real newspapers. At the same time, special attention must be paid to the production of anything that the audience has time to read, such as headline titles, to avoid viewers with fast reading speeds "seeing through." For example, in a film set during World War I... Zheng Ji</p>
<h3>A Record of the Changhong Society</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jiyun</p>
<p>There are many art groups in Shanghai. Those that I know of include the Pinghua Society, the Qiuying Society, and the Hanzhiyou Society. Their literary and artistic works have been widely circulated and provide ample evidence. The Changhong Society also has a long history and continues to exist to this day. Many of its members are elders, especially Shen Xinhai, who inherited the mantle of Qian Huian and enjoyed a great reputation for decades. Zhu Liangcai was also a prominent figure in the society. Although he has passed away, his works are passed down through generations and treasured as precious artifacts. At that time, the members often visited Huhainan, where Shen Xinhai's talented student, Xie Xian'ou, lived in Hejia Branch Street near the Dananmen, not far from Shen. They frequently visited each other to discuss art, enjoying many mornings and evenings together. They then formed the Changhong Society, which was established in Xie Xian'ou's home, and published the Changhong Painting Collection. During the recent incident, the Japanese invaders committed atrocities, and the Dananmen area suffered even more severe devastation, and the Changhong Society was reduced to ashes. Xie Xian'ou fled in a panic, not knowing where to go. After barely catching his breath, he tried to restore the society. At that time, Shen Xinhai had not yet passed away. The society's location was initially on Gordon Road, and then moved to the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road, facing Aili Garden across the street. It used art to gather friends, and the members numbered in the dozens, all renowned artists of the time. This summer, an exhibition of fan paintings was held, featuring landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds, everything was available. It is said that a fan exhibition will be held soon, and the society's affairs are flourishing, which is gratifying.</p>
<h3>Prison in China</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan was imprisoned in Shanghai Prison for three years due to the Subao case. In his prison diary from the Guimao year, he stated that he was thirty-six years old at the time, which was forty-six years ago. The prison officials at the time, both Westerners and Chinese, have mostly passed away, but some of Zhang Taiyan's old friends still know a little about the matter. All prisoners had work to do. Zhang Taiyan was initially assigned to the dining hall, washing dishes. Later, due to his frail constitution, he was reassigned to sewing. The prison life of a great master was no different from that of convicted criminals today. People in prison like to read Buddhist scriptures. Zou Rong also often asked Zhang Taiyan to explain Buddhism to him. Zhang Taiyan taught him Buddhist logic, saying that learning it could relieve his worries for three years. Zou Rong was young and angered by the inhumane treatment of prisoners by Westerners, and he soon became ill and died. Zhang Taiyan had already glimpsed the Buddhist scriptures, "delving into the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Nirvana Sutra, and other sutras." Since being imprisoned, he "specialized in the books of Maitreya and Vasubandhu. This is a method that begins with analyzing terms and ends with rejecting terms. The path of entry is similar to my lifelong practical learning, making it easy to adapt. After understanding this, one can reach the profound interest of Mahayana Buddhism. I privately believe that the profound words of Shakyamuni far surpass the philosophers of the late Zhou Dynasty, and the teachings of Cheng and Zhu are even less worthy of discussion." This is how he described himself. Then, not seeing the outside world for three years does not harm one's studies.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>The imperial examination system has a miraculous effect in breaking down class barriers. The so-called "ten years of hard study by a cold window, a moment of fame," the so-called "three-foot waves in the Yu Gate, a thunderclap on the plain," the so-called "becoming famous overnight throughout the world," are all realistic slogans. How could it succeed so much? Then there are subtle technical applications at work.</p>
<p>The county exam, the provincial exam, and the metropolitan exam each had several rounds, and if one failed in one exam, one took it again. Often one would be tested until one's hair turned white and one's face became wrinkled, one's brush became blunt and one's ink dried up, not knowing how many questions one had gone through, how many words one had written, but the most important thing was the eight-legged essay. The topics of the first round came from the Four Books, and the scriptures and policy questions in the second and third rounds were just embellishments. The examiners mostly chose based on the Four Books essays, so the scholars at that time often said, "The three rounds are led by the first, the first is led by the first essay, and the first essay is led by the first eight lines." The senior gentlemen who were the examiners had developed this way when they took the exams, and once they were examiners, they also used this method to select scholars. This tradition had been going on for hundreds of years. Therefore, scholars in "cold windows" first had to carefully study and practice the Four Books and Zhu's annotations, as well as the model examination essays and test poem of their predecessors. Next were the Five Classics, and then books on history and geography were used for reference. Each province and each examination was the same, with a uniform pattern. Acquiring or borrowing these materials was not difficult, far from the heavy tuition fees of later schools. Compared with school enrollment, there were a few popular sayings in the early years of the Republic of China: "The children of the minister, president, prime minister, and bank CEO are PhDs who study abroad; the children of high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants are university students; the children of ordinary officials and merchants graduate from middle and elementary schools; poor children have no books to read." It was also said, "A degree is for the aristocracy." This was inevitable, and there was no denying it. But in the scientific era, this problem did not exist. The few books and articles prepared by the poor and impoverished were the same as the few books and articles needed by the rich and wealthy. Even if they had the ability to provide their younger siblings with a great academic education to become old PhDs, they would still be "useless in the imperial examination field" and would be in an equal opportunity with those from cold windows to win a place on the list.</p>
<p>Because high officials and the senior members of the Hanlin Academy were accustomed to speculation and able to communicate their intentions, they also established a "official paper" restriction, that is, for the children of high officials or members of the Hanlin Academy, the number of examinees was first checked for each exam, and a certain quota was set. If the quota was exceeded, they were not allowed to be selected, and they were not allowed to be included in the top eighteen candidates, to prevent people from powerful families from taking advantage of their superior positions and hindering the career paths of impoverished scholars. As for the enforcement of the law against those who cheated (in the Shunzhi and Xianfeng dynasties, there were major imperial examination cases, and the chief examiners were beheaded or exiled), the chief examiners cherished their reputations, valued literary talent, and adhered to the principle of impartiality, hoping to establish literary and moral connections, and mostly did not accept bribes and were not greedy. With legal sanctions above and mental satisfaction in their hearts, although cheating in the imperial examination could not be completely eliminated in practice, the impression of "impartiality" and "uprightness" was extremely deep and widespread, and it could grasp the hearts of the people nationwide and concentrate their faith, which was by no means accidental.</p>
<p>The social significance is as described above. However, from the perspective of academic culture, it was completely outdated. In addition to stereotypical essays, calligraphy, and poetry, some things about history and geography were not clear. Even in the era of seclusion, it was not enough. (Among them, those who excelled in economics and politics and established fame, such as Zeng and Li, were due to their individual talents and application, and not due to the power of the imperial examination's eight-legged essay and small regular script.) What about the trend of the world's cultural progress? It was certainly a "relic." The reason why I describe it in detail is that, firstly, this kind of spirit of "equality" and system is an important record in history; and secondly, the current mechanism for selecting officials, has some connection with the imperial examination and is of reference value. As for the current examination, it is based on school education and aims at genuine talent and practical learning. The reporter also has many years of experience in school life and school examinations, and will discuss them in another article.</p>
