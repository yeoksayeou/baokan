<h3>經濟方案的商業實施辦法</h3>
<p>經濟改革的實施辦法，已經各部會分別將就，且經全國經濟委員會修正通過，其全文已不紊，而平舖直叙，缺乏重點，則類似一篇細帳。在招待時，欲求分道並進，百廢俱舉，至少在運動員戡亂，軍事第一的時期，事實上的可能性如何，似是一極大問題。</p>
<p>其次，此實施辦法，雖中謂實施，而實則理想與抽象的觀點仍覺太多，如何付諸實施的確切計劃依然較少。故眞正的實施辦法以，在鬧得地或尚須另行酌擬。再其次，爲所擬辦法，與現行的實際情形，扞格甚多：空間是否行得過，亦還是問題。茲請就商業部份的實施草案，略加詮釋，以見一斑。</p>
<p>現在有許多貨物，在運銷上頗多限制，其中有關於地域的，也有關於種類的。加以內匪受限制，分配有限額，許可有手續，而幣制上，運輸上種種事實上的困難尚不在內。觀於北方請願代表最近在京滬一帶所陳述的痛苦，可知國內貨物的交流，除了無條件地予以便和促進外，實在不應該更予以任何拘束，草案規定「國內各經濟區之物資交流，應……擬定總計劃，付諸實施，」我們不知道這項交流的總計劃應如何擬訂？其內容究竟如何？其目的又是如何？所秒鐘經濟區，究竟如何解釋？在加上種種「計劃」之後，實際上是否會把物資交流，反而做成了物資的阻截和分隔？這只好留待日後事實的證明了。</p>
<p>草案中數數提到貸款，如「對於外銷物資，尤其物產，應從生產製造，內地運輸，轉口銷售，建立一經常之連繫貸款制度。」又說，「外銷物資之打包放款，出口押匯及保險，應由承辦銀行或公司酌量放寬其條件。」這些當然都是出口工商業者所求之不得的甘露，可惜起草人好像並沒有注意到現在政府的緊縮信用與抽緊銀根政策。否則，這一連串的和經常的連繫貸款制度，又如何會建立得起來？</p>
<p>其中還有好幾個項目，說起來，都是很好聽的，例如：（一）各機關團體公用物品限用國貨；（二）禁止奢侈品及其他不需要物品進口，並限期禁止在市面上流通；（三）禁止奢侈品及其他不需要物品進口，並限期禁止扶助其發展等等。可是當地特產捐的征收，和某種貨物的禁止運輸出境，這在最小的單位如縣政府，已大有此種無上權力，何况更高級的政府？豈不見向許自由流通的米糧，還要營中央和各省政府三令五申，五等條之規定，地方政府只須手續完備，對於當地特產，不是又明明可以課稅嗎？」</p>
<p>至於公用物品，限用國貨，此事是否行得通，只消隨便往那一個機關或團體裏去參觀一下，便可得到一個明確的結論。我們不相信，仗着這個空空洞洞的實施草案，便可以把這崇拜洋貨的壞風氣挽回得過來！</p>
<p>照現行法，奢侈品本來是禁止進口的。然而各地奢侈品滿坑滿谷，充斥市塲，這是有目共睹的事實。當局儘管聲明嚴厲緝私，有關各業（如絲襪業等）並且大聲疾呼，要求禁止，當避亦予以深切的同情，無奈言之匪艱，行之惟艱。各地對於這些私貨，無論經在將進口時，或已進口後，似乎一籌莫展，只好袖手旁觀，以不理理之。豈不見魚翅海參之類，在大都會裏，在小城市裏，還到處可以見得到吃得着？酒館裏縱然不吃，公館裏視為珍品！其他各種奢侈品，又不是堂而皇之地陳列在各商店的櫃裏嗎？</p>
<p>抵銷進口之代用品，應儘量扶助其發展，這也是人同此心，心同此理的。問題的焦點，是在製造此項代用品的原料，其進口限額能否予以放寬？其需要的動力，能否不遭受到限制？其所肩荷的過度負担，又能否酌予减輕？有關各業為此等問題奔走呼籲，屢見報載，但政府大員有否動於中？例如有二三家造紙廠已定好造紙的新機器，每架可以日產三五十噸的紙，又有定了可造木槳的機器，而聲請購機外匯，已經半個月了，却依然擱置而無下文。我們很盼望，由於這個實施辦法的實施，而使本問題能獲得相當的解決。</p>
<p>草案又主張，在必要時，對於出口貨，仍由政府收購，以爭取國際市塲，並指定若干重要物品，推行進出口連營辦法。這也是大家所熱切切望的。在這外匯枯竭，物資缺乏的時候，所謂進出口連營辦法，實在無理由可以把牴依舊高擱起來。有這出口呆滯，無法推動的時候，政府的出口貨收購政策，實亦無理由可以長此觀，不再認眞切實地去推行。統觀商業部份的實施辦法，允以這兩個規劃最為切要。但其所擬的　物交換方案，原祇主張另由全國合作物品供銷處來試辦，期與國際合作團體相呼應，我們以為不如擴大收購，和實行進出口連鎖辦法，較為簡捷易行。</p>
<p>在發展內貿易方面，草案主張督促各企業重估固定資產，以吸收新資金，這又似乎把本問題看得太輕易了。現在已成的企業為何不能擴展，新興的企業又為何不能發達，這從淺近一點說，應當歸根於通貨·利率·運輸·勞工等因素未盡合理，而從遠大一點說，則須推及到軍事，政治，社會等方面有待澄清。雖說就事論事，各有範圍，不應當統通牽入商業問題，然而鼓勵投資，獎進企業，不宜單從重估固定資產入手，則可斷言。</p>
<p>總之，從大體言，商業部份的實施辦法，其內容未免貧乏，且缺乏遠大的建設性，其所建議各項，亦大都陳陳相因，非實際上依然辦不通，卽是枝枝節節，無裨大局。其於現在商業上所遭受的各種障礙，除空言不得限制貨物輸出，和不得征收特別捐稅外，其餘均沒有隻字觸及，好像工商業者所感的痛苦，政府至今尚未完全明瞭，尤覺令人失望。看來這篇文章，名曰實施辦法，而其結果又無非為經濟文獻上平添一種備查的資料而已！</p>

<p>西歐聯盟已開始發動　阻止蘇聯控制歐陸　貝文發表英國外交政策　　〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕貝文外長今日在下院宣布英國外交政策，主張西歐各國聯合對付蘇聯，以防其以殘酷手段控制歐陸，發動此種計劃，時機業已成熟。　　〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕建立西歐聯盟之談判業已開始，首先參加之團將爲英國，法國，荷蘭，比利時，及盧森堡。各參加國的海外廳領亦將成為聯盟的組織份子。貝文外相廿二日下午在下院發表檢討英國外交政策之長　演說時，定佈前項談判之將開始。其言有云：「吾人將與我法國盟邦，共同西歐國家發動此項談判，本人希望與荷，比盧訂立條約，使吾人與法國訂立之條約成為西歐之重要核心。吾人將聯合其他有歷史的歐洲國家，包括新義大利在內，參加此一偉大聯盟」。貝文又　告蘇聯，告以在國際事務中玩火為危險的舉動。但屆時又聲明，「英國政府目前所為，決非針對蘇聯或其他國家，但吾人有　組織西方同種的靈魂，正如彼等組織東方同種的靈魂一般。」他又說：「本人相信鞏固西歐的陸機業已成熟，吾人今正式向法國建議，成立政治同盟，吾人將保持最密切的聯繫，爲兩國問更緊密的團結而努力。目前巳屆吾人應設法發展對荷·比·盧三國關係的時期，我駐布魯塞爾，海牙，盧森堡之代表，巳於昨日奉令與法國代表洽商，以發動此項談判。使義大利參加西歐聯盟，重要殊不在其他西歐國家之下。西歐代表，正迅速而有效地合作，此乃良好現象，吾人當盡力以謀促進合作精神。於此本人必須指出此項聯盟不能基於地理原因，僅以歐洲爲限，歐洲之勢力巳伸展至全世界，故吾人之目光，猶須視遠至西歐以外，首入眼簾者爲菲洲，該處的偉大責任，由南菲法國，比利時，葡萄牙，會同吾國分相。在東歐及西方各國　蘇積極謀取控制　此種企圖仍將陸續出現　　吾人更須注意其他海外土地，尤其是東南亞洲，荷蘭在該處佔有重要地位，此等歐洲組織，務須在經濟上予以支持，因此各英共和邦及其屬領，以及法·荷·比·葡之海外土地，應保持最可能密切的合作，此等土地，蘊藏大宗富源，可供充分發展，其出產之原料糧食及其他資源，可給予常地歐洲以及全世界之人民以極大利益。此項計劃，與亦見龐大資源的美蘇兩强，並不衝突。　　爲使歐之支付得以平衡起見，其資源必須予以發展使用，並依適當方決互相交換，今在由英國負責的，海外屬領內，社會經濟的發展已在積極推進，其他在海外有土地的西歐國家，將合同英國從事同樣任務以團結數萬萬人的力量組織及機會，以開發自歐　經由中東菲洲直抵遠東的資源，使全世界更見富庶，更爲安全。吾人相信我共和邦之友人，必願與我人合作。」貝文繼乃述及對蘇關係，他說：蘇聯方面巳透　其有盡其力量以使共產黨在東歐以及西方獲得控制權的政策，本人相信共產黨的計劃，芷在每國內積極推進，吾人已在波蘭·保加利亞·匈牙利，最近更在　馬尼亞發見此等把戲，就吾人所獲情報觀，不久在其他處所將有類似的企圖出現，問題並不在　蘭或他國的組織方面而在蘇聯之控制東歐，蘇聯疆界事實上已伸展至史德丁，特里埃斯特及易北河，然猶未感滿足。在希臘彼等以爲英美終將感覺厭倦，隨後即可毫無危險的承認共產叛黨的政府，使希臘人民被拍接受共產政府，卒將希臘併入共產系統之內，在希臘的問題，非爲選舉何種方式的政府而爲不顧一切的將希臘併人蘇聯勢力圈以內，此乃危險的局勢亦即典型的强權政　。對希臘問題　特提出警告　　聯合國機構已遭希臘北鄰的嘲笑，本人於此必須鄭重提出警告，類此的挑撥舉動，右時將引起嚴重的發展，此等事件應本聯大決議解決，不可憑藉促進內戰，或承認馬柯斯政權而謀取解決。吾人旣已接受聯大其他的決議，當然亦必須接受關於希臘的決議。須知在國際事務巾玩火，乃極危險之事，對弱小國家施行神經戰，將使協議的成立更爲困難，宣傳決非解決國際問題的方法。貝文所述之其他要點如下：伊拉克：本人以及伊拉克總理決不簽字於不顧伊拉克民族意志的任何文件，本人願向我伊拉克之友人保證，吾人決將面臨共同的問題，不論其係與防務或社會經濟發展有關的問題，本人切盼此一審愼起草的條約，得爲中東防務部署發展的模範。外約但：余將與外約但總理討論新局勢，外總理費染爾，下月初即可來此。埃及：本人切盼過去與埃及的不協議空氣得以消滅，但尚需要若干時間。貝文並日：中東及西歐的此等步驟，均與聯合國原則相符合，俟四强主義的爭執獲得解決，和平的意志得以站定時，前述之種種步驟均可適合聯合國之原則。邱吉爾贊成　貝文反蘇主張　　〔本報訊〕倫敦廿三日廣播：邱吉爾今日在下院發表演說，支持貝文昨日宣佈之外交方針，力促西方民主國家竭盡所能以避免戰爭，並主張在蘇聯未有原子彈前，與蘇聯切實談判，以謀獲致現實之解決辦法。　認為蘇聯在一二年內可有原子武器。邱氏指出蘇聯之鐵幕正逐漸向外擴展，危險正與日俱增云。德國的分裂　實由蘇聯造成　　關於德國部份，他說英國政府始終認爲德國的分裂，將迭成不其和平意志而具報復觀念的國家。波茨坦會議已議定設立中央機構以根據新基礎建立新德國，然蘇聯政府不事企圖覓取共同政策，反對西方盟國濫施指實，具文最後又說：歐洲團結的觀念決無可以非議之處，問題乃爲是否得以不由一強統治歐洲而完成歐洲的統一。如有一强以直接或間接的方法企圖統治歡洲，結果必再引起戰爭。希望吾人均能棄絕此一觀念。英國之政策在使小國很在四强的庇護下，不必畏懼衝突而有發展的機會，但在四强之一向小國强迫其接受政治及經濟制度的時期，吾人不能同意。四強合作政策　必須逐步進行　　四強合作的政策，吾人於組織西歐聯盟之際，必須逐步進行，基於平等原則，並包含自由的因素。歐洲分裂狀態之繼續存在，皆蘇聯的意志所造成，此項分裂實與蘇最高當局及史達林元帥之聲明背道而馳。　　蘇聯與荷比盧　簽訂貿易協定　〔合衆社莫斯科廿二日電〕根據比國方面消息，蘇聯業已與比利時，荷期及盧森簽訂一項貿易協定，規定交換貨物。該項協定，傳爲蘇聯戰後以來對東歐以外各國之最大一筆買責，係穌貿易官員與荷·比·盧三國代表在莫斯科經渦約有八週之談判，始行締結者。荷比盧三國　將放棄中立　　〔路透社布魯塞爾廿二日電〕貝文率直指出國際局勢之嚴重性以及渠之建議擴大英法盟約，可能使荷比盧三國完全推翻三國共同採取的中立外交政策。政界人士指出，促使英法提出擴大盟約的環境，已使荷比盧不能綱續保持其中立政策，直到倫敦外長會議破裂前爲止，荷比盧三國固仍反對西歐集團主義而贊成聯合國憲章所規定的區域協定。　　〔路透社海牙廿二日電〕荷報評諭貝文演說，重視英國在歐洲政治中之重要地位。自由然之新郵報調歐洲政治，若無英國即不能存在，歐洲處於世界政治火綫之下，歐洲任何一國均不能單獨自衛，目前進行之談判，爲趨向歐洲統一之第一步。天主敎報謂蘇聯已在東歐建立大規模的政治經濟事同盟，英國今已屆決定之時矣。伊總理促政府　批准英伊新約　　〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕伊拉克經理廿二日在長途電話中與巴格達官員會議，圖回挽伊攝政王拒絕最近延長之英伊條約一事。伊總理告英外交部稱，渠可担保伊攝政之否決英伊條約乃山於「誤會」所致。渠表示信心，一俟渠返國後英伊條約將可批准。按一般皆認爲英伊幾約乃英國外交上之重要攻勢，以阻止蘇聯進人中東。伊總理又稱，在渠亂國期間，若干破壞份予利用無辜之學生，迭成不安之局面。法國際銀行　將批准法郎貶值　　〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕法財政部方面訊，雖有英國之反對，國際銀行可望於廿三日批准法國法期之貶價。法內閣今日舉行緊急會議，據可靠方面訊，內閣之法議大致如昨日財長梅逸之言，即週末前財務上必有所決定。英國反對之理由乃鑒於法國之形成自由貨幣市塲對金鎊將有不利之影響。貝文組西歐核心主張　華府人士極滿意　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿三日廣播：華盛頓訊，美國政府對於英外相貝文昨日所稱西歐應結成軍事同盟以應付蘇聯之擴張一節，正式表示衷心之歡迎。　　〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕此間人士對貝文所建議之在外交上團結西歐，以抗蘇聯齣統治趨勢，表示歡迎。認爲乃馬歇爾方案强有力的補充。此間並認貝文的演說，表示英國外交政策已有新的轉向，與杜魯門主義進入同一路綫。　　而貝文之言辭，更較杜魯門主義宣布之初，美政治家言論爲率直而有力。共和黨外交顧問杜勒斯稱，貝文的主張極度重要，可以鼓勵國會對馬歇爾方案所採取的行動。范登堡稱之爲驚人的言論，特別指出貝文所建議的由英法與荷比盧樹立聯繫，爲「渠自歐洲所聽到最有希望的聲音。衆院對外救濟專家赫德，亦表示相信美國援助計劃將因歐洲國家之願意合作而獲益。此間人士並認貝文之呼籲建立西歐核心，正當其時。蓋美外交權威杜勒斯，巴魯樞最近亦有類似建議提出，而巴魯樞之建議，尤較貝文的呼籲更進一步，主張建立歐洲政治經濟及防守同盟，而由美國給予保證。紐約先鋒論增報記者李浦曼，則反對成立西歐公約，認爲將促成西歐之分裂，他指出若干國家若挪威，丹麥，法國，義大利等尚不能爲歐洲十六國之其他國祖任防守之責，故料大部份西歐國家，將拒絕參加西歐公約。　　〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕此問人士認爲貝文之聲明，適發表於國務部發表關於德蘇關係秘密檔案之後之二十四小時，實乃英美的聯合外交行動，諒貝文致辭之先，已曾與美政府交換意見，外交界及報界認貝文之意，在警告蘇聯，告以西方國家不允在未有統一的努力以維持均勢之情形下，聽任片而勢力控制歐洲。　　〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕法外交部於廿二日下午發表聲明，對貝文在下議院中宣布英法巳開始採取行動，以建立西默政治統之語，表示完全贊成。美國開始廣播　德蘇外交秘密　　〔中央社紐約廿三日電〕此間「美國之聲」無綫電台，已於今開始用多種語音，將希特勒與史達林合作下秘密文件，向仳界各地作簡略廣播，從而發動對蘇聯之反攻宣傳。是項由國務院發表之文件，連同英國對西歐聯盟之計劃及英外相對蘇聯外交政策之指責，乃今日各報大字標題之新聞，葛羅米柯刻在成功湖對莫斯科與柏林協商紀錄之公佈，拒絕發表感想。　　〔聯合社喬治亞州哥倫布斯廿二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日在此向記者稱，國務院原擬在倫敦四國外長會議前公布蘇聯與納粹所訂立之各種密約，嗣以「吾人擬興蘇聯成立協議」，故將其暫緩發表。法願與越盟和解　使越盟在法聯盟內獲得獨立　將與保大簽訂正式協定　　〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕法駐越高級專員彼拉爾之返越，將使法政府重建越南和平齣努力，進入新的階段。波氏與保大之晤談雖未護得預期的迅速結果，然已爲共同滿意的解決，佈置了新基礎。東京·安南·交趾支那之人民厭戰心理已愈增，而胡志明之　望，亦已不如以前。越北軍事局勢轉與法方有利，惟南部產米區交趾支那，則遊擊隊之活動已愈見增加。法方今已準備允許越盟在法國聯盟內獲得充分獨立，關於允許交趾支那與東京安南合組越盟共和國事，法政府或準備使國民黨獲得滿意。惟法方將堅持越方所簽協定，必須爲永久性者，法方感覺胡志明僅認協定爲暫時的工具，將以之爲再提其他要求之跳板，故法國如能與保大簽訂正式協定，即不致再有此慮。　　〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕官方對法國之計劃使保大回返越南任安南東京與交趾支那自治領之統治者之見，一般表示同意。西歐自由受威脅　美不應獨善其身　馬歇爾談歐洲復興方案　　〔路透社阿特蘭泰廿二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今日在此向全國棉業委員會發表演說稱，爲使歐洲復興計劃獲得最後成功起見，歐洲十六國務必繼續開始於去夏巴黎會議之努力，獲致歐洲之團結。　　馬歇爾方案乃拯救西方文明的合作計劃，在歐美四億一千五百萬人之協力下，確信西方文明必能繼讀存在並趨於發達。此等共同努力的結果，匪特將決定歐洲事件即時的途徑，且將影響東南西北各處美國人的未來。馬歇爾方案目標廣泛，效果遠大，故無一美人，能漢然視之。其目標如不獲實現，則其失敗的效果，將波及每一部份。美國與每一受惠國所訂之協定，將以對抗通貨膨脹，恢復對國幣之信任，便利物資，貨幣勞工之越國界自由移動。此等條件不致妨碍歐洲權利，且可保證資源之得供最佳的共同利用。歐洲國家如果浪費美國經濟可能供給的援助，其木身將爲主要的受害者。今有强大勢力正脅迫西歐採取放棄其自由的政治制度，吾人不可以爲僅有吾人保護個人自由及代表政府的原則即可維護其安全，吾國雖屬强國，但吾人不能同時保持孤立及强大。吾人需要友人，尤其是與我具有同一社會組織觀念的友人，自由主養的維獲者，必須密切合作，蓋爲維護自由主義，不僅需要個別努力，尤需集體努力。胡佛對援歐案建議　　〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿二日電〕前總統胡佛，本日致函參院外交委員會主席范登堡，建議美國對於歐洲復興計劃之義務，應以最初十五個月為限，一切贈予，亦以剩餘之消耗品為限。此一共和黨政治家稱：歐洲對於主要物資與設備之需要，一部份或可由美國進出呂行及世界銀行之貨款予以資助。胡佛估計在歐洲復與計劃最初十五個月內，美國不妨輸出三十億美元之消耗品，朝鮮，及德，日兩國境內佔領工我之輸出。據稱，胡佛之同僚表示，胡佛預料貸款將增加約十億美元，共計為四十億美元，渠感覺第一年應提供此數。印荷對政治原則　雙方解釋不相符　仍需調解委會重予解決　　〔路透社巴達維亞廿二日電〕消息靈通方面稱，印尼及荷蘭所已接受之六點政治原則，由於雙方解釋不同，需要由安全理事會之斡旋委員會市返　城加以解決。海牙昨日發表之聲明，指印尼共和國祇　基於其片面的解釋而接受該六點原則，並日荷蘭政府已要求調解委員會就此事加以　淸。在廓清以前，原定明日開會之若干小組會，巳宣布展期。六項原則由之第一項，規定印尼之主權移轉於印尼合衆國以前，荷　將保持其在印尼之主權，然共和國發言人於昨日聲稱，根據印尼共和國與調解委員會在日惹開會時之記錄，在雙方議定相反的狀態以前，仍將繼續維持現狀，共和國並聲明彼等將繼續指揮其國防，財政及外交關係。馬歇爾方案　可撲滅未來戰爭　戰時謀報局長之意見　　〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕戰時任諜報局長之杜諾文將軍，今日告參院外委會稱，蘇聯今正僱用受過訓練的間諜，對美國進行戰爭。馬歇爾方案將用作撲滅蘇聯的不公開戰爭；美國的危險，在於允許蘇聯或他國，奪佔美友邦所佔之基地，越過美國的交通綫，而以分解戰術伸入內圍防綫。待彼時發見有赴戰齣必要已有力不從心之苦。美國苟能抓住主動，即可避免實際的射擊戰爭。馬歇爾方案的重要即在此，但同時亦不可視之爲經濟的馬奇諾防綫。馬歇爾方案須輔以其他武器，尤不可使其措施被共產黨或宣傳武器所破壞。柏德生反對　削減援歐數額　　〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿二日電〕今日另一批重要私人公民出席參院外交委員會，就美國對歐洲復興計劃建議由之援助，表見解。彼等之論詞，極大多數贊成成立法案，授種撥付六十八億美元作爲該計劃最初十五個月之用，猶如杜魯門總統所提出者。此等私人公民巾，包括前陸軍部長柏德生。「大西洋憲章雜誌」編輯麥　基爾·以及前戰時戰略服務局局長杜諾文等。同時衆院外交委員會繼續聽取政府重要發言人之意見。柏德生力言削减建議中之美國援助數額實屬愚蠢，渠謂「主張削减四五十億美元者，顯屬未能認淸目標。蓋削减後之計劃可防止大量民衆集體餓死，但不足以使復興實現。聯合國開始研究　聖地設置國際軍　　〔合眾社成功湖廿二日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦委員會確信，在聖地設置國際軍隊，實屬必須，特於廿二日命令澈底研究一切有關設置此項武力之建議。聯合國秘書處將於廿三日以歷史資料提供該會。據一般跡象看來，該會終將提出特別報告，要求軍事上之協助。　　巴勒斯坦委員會負有監視劃分巴勒斯坦爲猶阿兩邦之重任，業已開始草擬其第一次每月報告，準備提呈安全理事會。報告小將叙述英國反對聯合國大會之建議，拒絕開放巴勒斯坦各港口，任令猶人無限制移民。　　〔合衆社貝魯特廿三日電〕據目擊者言，有數千阿刺伯軍自叙利亞與黎巴嫩滲入巴勒斯坦。據不甚可靠方面之消息，先有巴勒斯坦境內之阿軍向猶太人進攻，英軍往救時，邊外阿剌伯軍即自離開戰爭地點較遠之邊境偷入巴勒斯坦。彼等均為配備精良之優秀軍隊。　　合國原子能委員會之常務委會致辭稱，財委會現正詳加硏究之蘇聯原子管制建議，渠並無成見，並要求其他各國代表亦採同樣態度。今日委會繼續研討蘇方之建議時，魏氏曾參加其他數代表之行動，向蘇外次葛羅米柯就其管制原子建議提出若千特別問題。美陸部請撥五億元　充作對日救濟費　　海爾賽稱日本為反侵略堡壘　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕軍部要求於下屆財政年度對日善後救濟費約在五億元之譜，其程序業已提出遠東委員會，其中麥帥總部所擬對日衣食及其他敎濟物資約佔三億元，日本工業復興經費約佔二億元。　　〔聯合社費拉合爾菲亞廿三日電〕美國戰時第三艦隊司令海爾賽上將今日在費城紡織學院同學會演說稱，美國欲使歐洲及日本經濟復興，並於未來時期協助警備全世界，則在若干年內必須付出極高之代價，然此究勝於第三次世大戰。不獨歐洲需要復興，日本亦然。日本在將來可成爲美國及其未來侵略者中間之堅强堡壘，故我人必須與以生活之機會。蘇拒絕朝鮮委會　進入北韓佔領區　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿三日廣播：成功湖訊，蘇聯拒絕聯合國朝鮮委員會之要求，不准該委會進入朝鮮蘇軍佔領區。邀請北韓領袖　參加韓選舉　　　　聯合國代表團宣布　　〔聯合社漢城廿二日電〕聯合國機構駐朝鮮代表團今夜宣布，擬與朝鮮政界領袖九人磋商，並將以無綫電廣播邀請北鮮蘇聯佔領區各領袖參加，討諭朝鮮選舉籌備事宜。但北鮮諸領袖能否嚮應，仍無把握。希臘政府軍　對希北發動攻勢　　〔中央社雅典二日合衆電〕據軍方消息：希臘政府軍已在北部及中南部各區，向共產然遊擊隊發動攻勢，當經斃傷及擄獲遊擊隊員共二百四十一名，據未證實之官方消息稱，此次攻勢實際上係今冬迫使遊擊隊失去平衡之攻勢之一。美駐希軍事代表團首席陸軍武官李佛　且暗示稱，眞正大舉攻擊，將在春季展開，預料明年春夏之交，當可肅淸遊擊隊。希陸長史社勒都斯已下令召集國防軍十二營，於二月十二日開始行動。此批部隊係替代正規軍之駐防職務者，俾正規軍可開赴前錢作戰。聯合國情報及新聞自由會議　本報料室　　　　乙類非政府組織：爲：國際新聞記者組織。　　代表團之人數　每代表團之正副代表，各不得超過五人，顧問視需要酌定之。　　委員會之設置　會中擬設五委員會：　　（甲）　總務委員會，由　中正副生席及各主要委員會主席組成之，其任務爲　議事日程之建議，　決議草案之發交，　各委員會間工作之調整。　（乙）其他四主要委員會，由代表團各派代表出席。其任務分別如下：　討論情報機關之基本任務，情報自由之基本原則，及其他一般問題；　討論採集情報及國際傳遞問題；　討諭自由出版及接收情報問題；　研究法律問題及設立永久機構問題。　　情報資料之供給　由秘書長請求參加各國供給關於情報自由之資料，編爲備忘錄。由聯合國敎育科學文化組織供給戰區災區調査表，以資參考。　　臨時議事日程之　訂　臨時議程分爲九項，各項之內容如下！　　第一項　關於情機自由原則之一般討論：　　審査大會，理事會，人權委員會，情報自由小組委員會，及其他組織所表示之意見。　　第二項　情報機關在採集，傳遞，及廣布情報，脫去束縛時所應重視之基本原則：　　　據實陳述，不存偏私，傳佈所知，不懷邪意；　　　自由交換有關世界經濟，社會，及人道問題之情報，以求問題之解決，　　　尊重人權及基本自由，不分種族，性別，語言，或宗敎，遇右危害及此時，應排除之　　　求各民族間之互相了解及合作，以維世界和平，同時剷除情報機關中之一切好戰及煽動戰爭之潛勢力。　　註：「情報」一詞，係指報紙，新聞期刋，無綫電廣播及新聞影片而言。　　第三項　利於採集悄報之揹施：，居住，遷徒，旅行之便利；　　　酌給訪員以國際專業證；　　　保護訪員，不得强行驅逐出境；　　　儘量准許採訪私人及官方新聞，對於本國記者及正式派遺之外國訪員，一視同仁，不分軒輊；　　　取消一切妨得外國通訊社及訪員活動之不合理或苛刻捐稅。　　第四項　利於國際傳遞情報之措施：　　　逐漸取消和平時期之新聞檢査，以免妨得國際間情報之傳遞，但爲保陣國家安全起見，和平時期之新聞檢査，似難全部取消，故宜促成協議，以减少因新聞檢査而引起之不便，其方法爲：　　（甲）預先列舉不受檢査，不得發送之情報種類，同時公布檢査官通令禁止登載之新聞；　　（乙）新聞檢查，在發送新聞地點及有關之通訊員在塲時執行之，使得立即知悉已被檢査之部份；　　（丙）電報費以檢査後之字數計算。　　　由理事會向國際電訊同盟及萬國郵政　同盟建議，對於新聞資料之傳遞，予以特惠待遇。　　　對於外國通訊社之通訊，無收費不平等，或在服務上歧視情形。　　　减少國外發來新聞資料之經濟及商業上限制，如：　　（甲）現行稅率，定額管制，及匯兌統制；　　（乙）有限制性或專利之商業行爲。　　　防止足以危及新聞自由之通訊社同業同盟化。　　第五項　關於自由出版及收受情報之措施：　　　審議各國政府對於個人或團體接受及傳布情報，思想，及意見時所受之限制，尤注意於：　　（甲）各國政府因政治上或其他原因，在供應資料時不予便利，發生歧視問題，　　（乙）新聞檢査問題；　　（丙）各國政府限制或管制其所統治下之人民收聽團內外電台廣播之收音機使用權問題；　　（丁）保障國家安全及公共秩序之條件問題；　　（戊）維持風化之要求問題；　　（已）處置誹謗之法律問題；　　（庚）情報事業之所有權，管理，行政，及利用問題；　　（辛）國內通訊員，訪員與外國通訊員所享權利上之區別問題。　　　建議增加國內外情報供應數量之方法：　　（甲）改進及增加物質設備，如印刷機，紙張，無綫電設備，活動電影機，及快遞設備之類，同時攷慮現有國際組織對於此項事業之活動及工作　　（乙）建議取消或減輕上述物質設備之現有稅率，定額管制，及匯兌統制；　　（丙）考慮目前各國問民衆報導設備之分配不均問題；設法解決通貨不穩國家所派通訊人員之外匯問題；　　（丁）審議目前若干國家通訊社偏頗發展問題，採行臨時措施，發展國內通訊社，至能在國際上競爭爲止；　　（戊）取消限制情報轍入與傳佈，使不得供應國內出版之用之專利，管制，獨占辦法　　　建議改善情報本質，使其正確，客觀，包羅萬象，而又有代表性，如：　　（甲）在可能限度內，各國根據互惠協定，大量交換通訊員；訓練通訊員之專門技能，使其能合準確公平報導之標準，對於工作所在國，能認識及了解，對於新式設備，能充份利用。　　（乙）用下述方法，排除虛僞情報：（子）研究辦法，使常有之顯然虛僞，用意不良之報導，不能散布，以免淆感聽聞，使國際關係趨於嚴重，各國不能互相了解，使納粹·法西斯·日本侵略主義之再現，無法防範，因而妨礙世界之和平與安全；（丑）研究確定責任辦法，尤其在法律方面，使散布虛偽及用意不良的報導之發行人，負其責任，則民族間之關係，方不惡化，不致引起衝突與戰爭；（寅）硏究處置誹謗之法律，以便向各國建議改善立法；（卯）硏究全世　普遍承認答辯權之可能性；　　（辰）硏究利用國內新聞機構傳布官方否認聲明方法，尤其關於他國之事項。　　（丙）鼓勵從事採集及傳布情機之專業團體，自訂其職數道德與能力標準。　　（丁）硏究在世界各主要新聞中心點，組成具右自治能力之外國記者團辦法，是否可取或易行。　　第六項　審議草擬情報機關之權利義務憲章：　　　說明情報織關之權利，以及在聯合國範圍內，由於各項國際公約或多方或雙方協定而獲得保陣此項權利之方法。　　　明悄報機關之義務，以及保證履行此項義務之必要措施。　　第七項　審議能否設置水久機構，以促進正確情報之自由流通：　　　此項機構執行下列任務：　　（甲）收受，考慮及公布控訴之關於散布虛僞消息，發表用意不良或毀謗他人名譽之言論者，以及關於妨碍情報流通，與遠背因仳界會議而訂立之國際公約曁其他現行圃際協定者，　　（乙）隨時提議修改此項公約或協定之條款，公布其他有關情報自由問題之建議；　　（丙）繼續研究通訊社之目前情形及其他國際情報之工作程序；　　（丁）根據兩國所訂協定，建議互相訪問，互相研究各通訊社之工作情形；　　（戊）管制訪員專業證之發給。　　　審査在聯合國下，設置及維持上述機構，是否相宜；有無必要。　　註：理事會不得籌設任何機構，但可提出報告。　　第八項　審議因設置官方及半官方情報處而發生之種種問題，使本國以外之國家亦得接獲情報。　　考慮設置此項情報處所需之種種便利及保障，是否能由雙方協定，獲得最充份之保證，如能獲得，則概述此種便利與保障之性質，以便在協定中規定之。　　第九項　審議採用何種行動方式，使會議之建議案，最能生效，是否可用大會決議案，國際公約或雙方協定，抑由個別國家自定適當法律，或用其他方式？　　小組委員會之第二第三次會議日期　第二次會議在一九四七年年底或一九四八年年初舉行之。第三次會議在情報自由會議後舉行之。　　新聞紙張之缺乏問題　小組委員會因問題迫切，故建議：　　（甲）研究目前情勢，對於現有國際組織之工作，加以適當考慮；（乙

<p>淸江探古墓　漢晋遺物一臠　　牛頭山中有永和，寗康的古墓，大姑山中的古墓更多，元康，建地，中大通，中大同……都是漢晋梁文化史上的珍貴發現。　　〔本報樟樹廿日訊〕上年春間，記者報導過關於清江牛頸山漢晉古墓發現的經過以後，全國各大報都紛紛報載著這個珍貴和消息，京滬的友人在每次通訊裏，都關心着牠的近况和進展。此次承發現人饒惠元的邀約，作了一次探古的旅行，同行的除了省立樟中的徐少光校長，還有中國銀行樟樹分行齣汗魯愚，熊季淸·出了市區以後，就走上了去牛頭山的大道，我們談着笑着，走過小亭，轉過　　，遠遠望見一座平伏着的紅山，據饒先生說：那就是我們的目的地——牛頭山。　　牛頭山　　在山脚休息了片刻以後，我們便一逕向山中進發，山並不高，所以談不上是爬，矮矮的松林，襯着艷醉的映山紅，紅綠相間，自然的彩筆，將整個的山頭，描畫得那麼調和而美麗，從山頭下瀉，就轉人了丘陵地區，樹木也顯得稀少多了，沒有野花的凑熱鬧，也似乎更是荒凉了。饒先生提醒我們，寗康墓就在那高幹的樟樹下面，我們加緊了脚步，像狩獵家發現了野獸似的興奮。　　寗康墓　　寗康墓在荒山的路旁兀立着，墓礦坍露，幾株野草在牠的周團叢生着，碧綠的皮層，正表示着牠的出土有悠久的年月，疊疊的擴磚，一層，兩層，三層，墓地的周圍，大約是六公尺，洞口的荊棘，經過幾次探訪者的披斬，進洞去並不怎麼的艱難，汪主任奮勇的先進了洞口。記者也陸續追蹤而入，壙並不大，可是進去了五六人，也不感到擁擠，磚上染着濃厚的靑苔，磚塊都斷裂着，也許是對歷年來壓迫着牠們的泥土不勝負擔的無言的控訴吧。「寗康二年九月五日桂氏墓，』却很清晰古樸，極易辨認。大家在洞口，都幹着各人的工作，準備細心地挖出一塊花紋字體完整的磚塊，來作這次訪占旅行的珍貴紀念。　　寗康墓發見最早，甎文曰：「寗康二年九月五日桂氏墓」十一字，　端另有「桂氏墓」三字，字體結構，全似晋碑，花紋　作雲形圖案，綫條簡樸，考寗康爲晋孝武帝年號，距今一千五百七十三年，甎長三六公分，厚三四公分，　一八，五公分，另一側無文字花紋厚六。六公分。桂氏係何人，尚不可考，附近並無桂姓者。（拓片一）　　在寗康墓旁休息了一會，饒先生又率領着我們在墓地的附近遊　著，距寗康墓附近二十公尺的周內，都是一堆堆突出的古墳，饒先生選親自在路旁一個裂了口的墓中挖得了幾塊花紋不同有字　　旅行後的第二天，饒先生微笑的來告訴我們，昨天寗康墓附近發現的墓磚，已拓出了，是「永和十二年丙辰歲九月廿日」數字，在磚側又拓出「九日〇〇典〇今黃氏墓」十數字。永和是晋穆帝的年號，正是王羲之作蘭亭序後三年的遺物，比寗康墓還早三十年呢。（拓片二）　　大姑山　　　　離開牛頭山的訪問半年後，饒先生第二次邀我去大姑山，這時恰好國防部的巾將參謀劉德芳將軍，由南京歸來，也欣然參加了我們的團體。這次同行的有七八人，都懷着極高度的探古的熱情。由樟樹鎭東行七八里，是大橋墟，在大市鄉公所飽擾了一頓早餐以後，就開始向大姑山出發。大姑山離大橋墟只三四里，沿着小溪北行，經過幾個冷落的破舊的村莊，就轉上了阡陌的小徑，一會見就到了紅岡山。在幾株古松的左側，一個幾百公尺的古堡，就矗立在眼前。據鄕人的傳說，古堡是神仙一夜築成的，但是在附近皮姓宗譜上，却說是梁武帝時豪强築以自衛的。古堡的周圍，大概有一二百畝的而積，站在堡上，可以登高遠望，不過野草橫生，荒塚纍舉，使人大右滄海桑田之感了。出古堡，再走幾百步，就是大姑山，大家開始作古墓的探訪。饒先生如數家珍似的，述說着古墓發現的經過，劉將軍齣手杖，的篤的篤的發出淸脆的音響，首先我們訪問了元康墓。　　元康墓　　元康墓在離古堡半公里的斜坡上，是饒先生三月間發現的，墓塚共三起，成三角形，墓磚的突出，只有一尺光景，幾塊花紋樸渾的殘磚，四散的堆在墓旁，我們想掘出幾塊完整的磚塊，都沒有成功。據饒先生說：這些磚都是沒有經過火燒齣—晒陶，所以很容易破碎，他那裏僅存一塊完整的，有『元康九年已未歲……』字樣。元康是問飢民「何不食肉糜」的天眞皇帝晋惠帝的年號，在漢後八十餘年，距今一千六百四十八年，是饒先生收藏的紀元磚中最早的一種。在元康墓附近，還有幾家梁墓和普墓。　　漢墓：字跡年號雖未發見，然其墓磚花紋作雲暈及魚形，與金石索所載之漢磚花紋，同一趣味，且墓磚被風化之甚，質之鬆脆，亦較晋墓爲早。　　晋墓：晋墓有紀元之磚凡五，爲「元康』『永和』『升平」「寗康」等。文字殘磚有「長壽」「東天」「王□□」「張氏」墓等。其未發見紀元之墓，磚之花紋圖案，作雲形藥龍等狀，錢條渾樸，僅繁簡變化之不同而已。壙長約二丈，闊五尺餘，用三疊或二疊砌成，頗爲堅實，故有數蒙壙形尚馬完好。　　因爲需要看的紀元墓很多，所以沒有打住，就去看中大同墓。　　中大同墓　　轉過小路以後，在一片低斜的丘陵，因爲雨水的冲洗，山面凹凸得很厲害，像一個個紅色的大饅頭，平伏在山頂，一座龐大的梁墓，屹然孤立在許多饅頭的旁邊，幾株常靑的灌木，被微風搖曳着，像歡迎這些稀有的來客似的鼓舞着。中大同墓就在梁墓的下面，大家又拿起了鐵鋤和小斧，挖出了幾塊字體淸晰完整的紀元磚。劉將軍用手杖敲着墓壙傷感的說：「這是古代英雄們的悲哀？還是幸運。」我們也不由引起了懷古的情感。的確，這些有歷史性的古代文物，在這種兵荒馬亂的年代，誰去注意牠們呢？梁墓的左側，有幾蒙晋墓，。因爲沒有紀元磚，我們只略略憑弔了一會，就轉向了中大通墓，在晋墓的冲出土面的殘磚裏，我們檢集了幾口有英文圓樣似的花紋磚。　　中大通墓　　　　中大通墓距中大同墓有半公里，在山的最高處。同樣是饅頭形的丘陵起伏着。我們走上墓塚的時候，都微微覺得吃力，墓的出土較高，冲洗的程度也相當厲害，墓面雖一片靑綠，可是紀元磚却不易找到。　先生第四次來這裏的時候，曾挖出一塊完整的有：「梁中大通四年□□六月十□」。字樣，古磚中紀元上同時冠以刺號的紀元磚，還不多見，是彌足珍貴的。墓下是聶四娘墓，就是上次（去年一月一日申報）通訊中提到的「崔郎妻聶四娘墓」。此墓無年號及花紋甎，僅文曰：「崔四郎妻聶四娘墓」八字，甎質大小極似梁墓，惟其製作逈異，似先成泥坯，後加蓋印字，不若有　之同型出者，故其文字位置，有在側面，有在平面，橫斜旣無定式，笵甎亦失古意，至其稱謂之「郎」「娘」「妻」不類近代，字體筆意極似晋時，此則有待專家稽考硏究也。（拓片曾刋去年一月一日本報第五版）附近的普墓和梁墓，還是不少，這時太陽已爬過了中天，於是便怱怱的再去看齊建元墓。　　建元墓在出的尾側，再下去便是中盧村了，建元墓的墓磚，化了好久的工夫，才找到一塊字跡模糊的殘磚，直到遠遠傳來了村鷄的午啼聲，我們方戀戀的離了建元墓，興高彩烈的折回了大橋。細看中大同墓，文曰；「中大同元年」，笵於甎之一端，側面作雙錢紋，平面爲麻布紋，甎長三〇公分，厚六·三公分，闊一五公分，考中大同亦梁武帝年號，距今一千四百零一年。　　饒惠元先生說的話，頗値玩素，附錄如下：　　除上述古墓外，余曾於大姑山中，拾得灰陶數十片，花紋有爲繩壓紋。有係編織紋·有回字·萬字·壽字紋者，有紐紋凸凹旋紋者，種類達五十又三，質若灰泥，間作白·綠·黃·諸色，（久藏土中所致），若從其殘片之口沿耳紐脚柱察之，陶器甚大，有一部份似爲烹煮器，由此推測，古時山上定有居民，陶片乃其遺跡。（關於陶片，刻正搜集整理，俟後另文專述之。）　　考淸江古轄揚州，春秋屬吳越，戰國屬楚，三國屬矣，及普改隸豫章郡，故遠古實爲邊垂，其文化史實，記載者鮮，金石文物之見諸志　者，始自唐宋，前代闕如也。夫以春秋戰國之爭霸稱雄，三國之鼎足相峙，迨晋室式微，異族擾亂，致中原兵燹，殊少寗息，後雖南渡，偏安江左，然內鬥時起，民不安居，斯時贛江一帶，反爲樂土，文化發展，自易爲力。此前後二百餘年之葬家，表現輝皇，有由來矣。再就甎質言之，元康火度極低，　若泥塊，及梁則堅實細緻，如順次排列，其陶　之進步，瞭如指掌。又從花紋字體言之，時代風尚，顯著劃別，晋文以　茂爲勝，南朝以　秀為美，晋字仍承滿意，南朝漸類楷書，其　構變遷，充分表現字體的演進，繪圖之趨尚，淳厚簡樸，此不僅形容地方之情趣，實　研究民間藝術之資料也，以一縣之大，兩山之細，能有此三朝代之墓家，見於地面，謂與東南一隅之中古史料右關，實信而有徵矣。（饒惠元，徐益民寄自江西樟樹鎭）袖珍新聞　　　〔本報訊〕本縣省參議員候選人登記者，計有錢大鈞。　　。陶載厚·張為平·艾南屛·張如先。周以莊·凌昂霄·錢紹武。胡南琛。沈壯聲·沈高塵。范君博·　叔分·孔翔生·顧白羽·朱家積·范公任·金雪元等十九人。　　常熟　　〔本報訊〕縣府籌備開征地價稅手　，業經辦理完竣，定廿三日個全部啓征·甚盼各業戶依限究納。　　宜興　　〔本報訊〕溧境，載埠山中，奸匪死灰復燃，李縣長頃已組織宣　兩縣邊區聯防辦事處，使　興縣間，一氣呵成淸剿任務，於今廿一日成立。　　江陰　　　　〔本報訊〕上年十二月間，各報登載在滬破獲綁匪包，新係本縣候補參議員等語，據本縣參議會議長陳植三稱：本縣候補參議負，並無包菊新其人，顯係僞　，或由　傳所敎。　　嘉定　　　　〔本報訊〕南　　　走馬塘兩河工程，業已竣事。廿一日上午，徐縣長等親臨該處主持開　典禮。又：新涇河工巳完成十分之七，縣限廿四日全部完成。　　松江　　　　〔本報訊〕本邑城　地價稅，自參會議決緩征，重估地價後一縣府已於廿一日下午召開重佔地魯會議，經出席者熱烈討論，決定地價稅暫停征收，俟縣府呈省核示再奪。　　上饒　　〔本報訊〕浙贛路靈溪大　（距饒十公里），原係六孔二十公尺　，其中五孔，在戰時曾遭破壞，後雖經臨時修復，惟　載至爲薄弱，大型機車，不能暢行，現經第二鋼樑隊於列車空間，陸續抽換美製鋼樑，業巳竣工，大型機車巳可暢行　處軍法會審　孫家驤殺互案　　呈請判刑十年　候團防部核定　〔本報重慶廿三日電」行轅軍法會審孫家驤擊斃愛妻彭峻竹案，由國防部部員韓震由將任審判長·頃據本報記者獲悉：今呈請判刑十年，待部方核定漢晉古慕探　路綫（拓片三）「元康九年已未歲……」側為元康花紋　。（拓片四）齊建元殘　。文曰：「建八年。側為　工魚形紋。」楊大展慘死案　　湘省府發表處理經過　〔本報長沙廿一日航訊〕交通部部立衡陽扶輪中學體育主任楊大展被毆致死一案，湘省府於十九日發表處理經過，茲探誌於次：本案發生後，敎育廳即據報告案呈省府電令衡陽市政府査緝兇犯，移送司法機關究辦，一方派督學鄧運生馳赴衡陽澈査，並由省府函請湖南高等法院令飭衡陽地方法院緝兇嚴辦，旋省府爲求迅速破案復派軍法室主任葉宰業馳往澈査，經澈査結果認爲船山中學學生李華樸被扶輪中學學生毆害，實爲楊案導因。又楊大展被毆致死，確係船山中學學生李昌祐，雷裕禧等之所爲。省府據報後，即作如下之處分：　船山中學校長魏業坤領導乖方，予以撤職處分，並另令該校董事會迅將繼任校長依法報核。　船山中學敎務主任許炳琨，訓育主任劉昇運平時訓導無方，事後復任李昌祐等請假逃逸，均勒令解職，軍訓主任敎官蕭文英疏忽職責，亦經電請軍管區司令部予以懲處。　以上各員，均移送法院偵查，靜候處理，其餘各敎職員，均應切實考査與此案右無關係，再行斟酌聘用。　船山中學學生，除由法院提起公訴者，着該校開除學籍，幷協緝歸案究辦外，其餘各生，亦責成繼任校長嚴加管敎，分別考核，其餘此案有關者，應仍移送法院究辦。　嚴令扶輪中學調整人事組織，切實整頓學風。又：楊大展因公殞命，身後蕭條，省府王主席已發給特卹金一千萬元，以示矜卹。至關於本案之刑事部份，據聞扶輸中學學生毆傷船出中學學生李華樸，因被害人傷愈已久，不願告狀，經衡陽地方法院予以不起訴處分，船山中學職員許炳琨。劉昇運·蕭文英·故意使犯人隱避，各判處有期徒刑六個月，主犯李昌祐，雷裕禧等均在逃，已下令通緝。轉業軍官  張鳴　　跳窗自殺　　〔本報台北廿一日航訊〕台北市錫口療養院，住有資源委員會台灣金銅礦務局轉業軍官張震嗚，於本乃九日在該局跳窗自殺，頭部跌破，即送該院治療，終以受傷過重，於十九日正午，不治殞命。按；張君係湖南醴陵人，中央軍校六期畢業，歷任排速營團長，師政訓處長等職，去年秋，奉准轉業工礦管理，由資源委員會分發台灣金銅礦務局服務，平日生活淸苦，身後益覺簫條，現已由同學辦理善後。　　奉賢法院定期選城　　〔本報奉賢廿二日訊〕本縣地方法院院舍，及監辦設備，前

<p>政府決定自三月一日起　實行全面配給食糧　　先從京滬平津穗五大城市試辦　公敎人員配米下月起減為三斗　　京·滬·平·津·穗等五大城市，政府決於三月一日起，實施糧食全面配給。平津兩地，配給麵粉，京·滬·　三地配給食米。此項配給之糧食，百分之五十為美救濟物資，百分之五十，係政府自籌。據悉：此次決定按戶配給，每人每月食米一市斗。配給麵粉，以食米一斗折合麵粉六又四分之一斤，小口减半。配給價格，每月調獲一次，究按市價或低於市價，由政院決定，俾資遵循。本市方而，以五百萬人口計，百分之七十五爲大口，應爲三百七十五萬，餘爲小口，爲一百二十五萬，大口每月配米一斗，需食米三十七萬五千石，小口五升，需六萬二千五百石，合計四十三萬七千五百石，計折合三萬五千噸。政府現巳準備四個月之糧食，先配給三四五六四個月，七·八·九·三個月，政府仍準備縱續配給，俾於靑黃不接時期，右所接濟。過去公敎人員每月八斗，工人學生每凡兩斗之配米，一般認爲並不普及，太不合理，全面配給實施後，即一作取銷，以示公允。惟公教人員，雖按生活指數發新，其所購配給米，究屬右限，政府決謀補教辦法。二十三日國務會議，決定公敎人員配米自本年二月份起，其配米量每人每月减爲三斗（原爲八斗），祥細辦法由行政院擬定。據民食調配委員會負責人談：此次配給困難，自屬意料中事，　區保甲待遇菲薄，人力單薄，以致戶籍不淸，此其一。　承配之米店·合作社·及社會服務處，以其開支無着，難免不有滲雜及尅扣情事，此其二。　米價每月調整一次，目前利息甚高，誰願先行購買，損失子金。如均於月終購買，當發生排隊擁擠現象，現正設法解決，務使區保能盡職責。米店方面，亦應予以相當之折扣，彌補其問支。總之，今後所能發生之困難，當儘量求其减少。市塲人心激昂　華股十九停　　華股昨游資回流，金融帮來吸，空方急切補進，中途廣帮之實貨仍在流出，但遭人心激昂所冲銷，反動一起，十九漲達限度。　　晨開　已秀，永紗自六九七元及七三五元登塲後，升至七一〇元及七四〇元，以賣多回小至六九八元及七二八元。銀根轉鬆，復告向秀，塲外息價開低至二角八分半及三角三，升至七一五元及七四七元，經一度回小後，買氣大盛，中法內衣中絲永公新華勸興統益搪瓷景福信誼次第漲停，永紗竟漲達七二八元及七六五元高價，逢高乃多脫手，近午回小十元，午收爲七二二元及七五九元。結果較前收即交股計永紗中紡升半成，大通永公微升，統益中絲商務景福勤興內衣中法信誼新華漲停，餘均升一成光景。遞交股華豐景福勤興漲停，永紗升半成，新光美亞信和漲一成。　　後市　永紗上塲即升爲七一三五元及七六五元，賣到七三三元及七六〇元，仍告暴漲不已。除中紡大通及冷落無成交，增資暫停者外，咸告漲停。永紗亦漲到七五六元及七八六元高價。國行差進五百餘億，退至七三六元及七六二元，人心仍好，又升至七四八元及七七七元收市。較晨收即交股計永紗中紡微升，大通升半成，餘均漲停。遞交股永紗微升，餘咸漲停，塲外各未上市股票除大生三廠仍疲外，餘均轉穩。統價平疲　外股上升　　公債昨復不支，統丙晨開六萬八，自六萬七起，升至七萬一結束。成交約四百萬，較前收計甲乙丙各跌二千元，丁戊低三千元　外股昨證券帮人心激昂，港電雖長至三元半，怡紗自五五萬開後，步升至六〇萬大關收市，廣帮亦有吸收，洋商則出。較前收計會德鹽紙版航業鋼業懇植升半成，怡紗英聯紙版怡啤電車祥泰一成，電話好起成半。局部開放工貸　政府已允考慮　　陰關在邇，各地工廠紛紛要求政府局部開放工貸，以資救濟。全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初，對此問題曾於十一日携帶有關資料晋京，分別晋謁張院畏及經濟部主管首長，報告當前工業界實際困難情形，並提供意見。當時張院長對吳氏所陳各節，甚為重視，表示其原則可以接受，並認爲生產事業如確需救濟，政府當然不能坐視。張院長並將吳氏携去之資料允交四聯總處速擬辦法，一俟硏究後轉呈主席核示云。茲悉吳氏已於廿三日返滬，據稱開放日期，希望愈早愈好，惟關鍵端在四聯總處所擬辦法之早遲。數額方面，政府當有通盤籌劃，在工業界著想，貸款爲不得已之舉，貸得若干，當須顧及將來之歸還多少，其方式政府雖尚未明確規定，據悉擬採取定貨貸款。唯此項方式實與工業界環境未能完全適合，因原料價格及生產成本等均不能預作估計，此外成品之劃一標準及時間上之週轉等，亦有牽掣，吳氏長後稱，一且政府恢復工貸，本會當負責初步審査，以協助政府云。美金倆券　售出總數　　卅六年美金庫券銷售總數，截至一月二十二日止，全國共售出三〇七萬〇三百元，上海共售出二〇四萬〇九三九美元。又卅六年美金公債，共已售出二四九萬餘美元。食米消化轉暢　油米形勢活絡　　昨日南北兩市，共到米糧九千六百餘石，天氣陰雨，店胃轉股，消化轉暢。粳米早薄稻猛加三四萬元，秈米亦升二三萬元，白陰元隨之提升一二萬元。麵粉北銷活躍，買氣濃厚，飛奔二萬餘元。麩皮交易不多，略呈挺秀。豆餅汕頭進胃蟬聯，續漲一二萬元。黃豆客本互相爭取，油廠亦想抓吸，市化活潑，狂漲五六萬元。　　菉豆交易仍呆，價形平定。豇豆亦少榮辱，蠶豆零化有動，暫無上落。赤豆成交稀少，貨主扳堅，挺升二三萬元。紅糧銷塲不爽，存到兩少，回升一二萬元。　　苞米北洋重見暢納，猛騰五六萬元。芝蔴天津動辦，油廠亦貨，本街有動，轉漲三五萬元，惟黑蔴消比平常，價格平疲，生仁廣帮添辦，零化尚可，盤漲六七　　油市店胃蓬勃，供不敷求，各油相繼上漲二十萬元以上。開盤後直綫上升，形勢活絡，小麥相仿。暹米九千噸　海玄輪載來　　招商局海玄輪自曼谷載來中信局訂購之暹米九千噸，定廿六日中午返抵上海。聞中信局在曼谷訂購之暹米尚有二萬餘噸。　　又招商局海宙輪定廿五日由滬駛曼谷，奘運食米九千噸，中途經停香港及新加坡二地。到貨少市價漲　粉廠請配小麥　　第四區麵粉工業公會以本市及蘇浙皖三省各麵粉廠製粉原料價格飛漲，且今數月正屆靑黃不接之時，故於日前推派代表榮毅仁等分赴市政府及善後物資保管委員會，要求中美救濟物資中所有救濟小麥分配各廠磨製麵粉，以濟該業原料恐慌。據該會負責人稱：目前小麥價格不斷上漲，每担已高達八十萬元，市上且甚缺乏，各地則因交通困難，到貨殊少，故各廠急需當局向外訂購，中美救濟小麥即爲辦法之一。又聞糧食部向外訂購之小麥，又有五六萬噸，希撥配一部分云。銀樓兌製金飾辦法　國務會議業已通過　本市銀樓業在辦理登記中　　〔本報訊〕銀樓業收兌及製造金飾管理辦法，業經昨日國務會議通過。關於銀樓業兌出價格，允許以國行掛牌價格計算，再加營業費百分之四十，另加合法利潤百分之二十，加工費由當地同業公會決定之。惟關全部價格，財部有規定不得超過脾價百分之九十二之說。記者昨曾向本市銀樓業同業公會某負責人，微詢意見，渠表示：本業近正遵照市社會局規定，開始辦理登記。登記手續，社局雖定二週內辦完，惟業內一週即可辦竟。待彙總該局審核後，再呈財經兩部，頒發營業執照。自飾金停止買賣後，各地同業，類多綱續經營。本市同業之復業，及營業費，利潤，工資等計算問題，尚待登記完竣後，召開理事會議，正式商定，然後提請當局核准照辦云。人絲初堅後疲　廠經交易仍寂　　人造絲昨市忽告挺升，因傳說中信陰歷年內已無配售，故人心甚好。一二〇號旭字有光，開盤即升至九午萬元有成交，最大到六百萬兀做開，乘高不乏吐售。收盤降至三百萬元即期價，下午因悉配售尚有一次，人心呈軟，最後行情爲二百萬元，結果仍比上日大五百萬元。　　廠經　昨市交易仍寂，故未見起色。上午做開　字等級五包，價做九千一百五十萬元，高零担九千萬元亦有二担成交，其他各級喊價，俱與上日相仿。下午人心雖較振奮，但毫無交易。　　綢貨　昨市呈昂，華强真絲被面開市行情，與上臼相仿。後悉設市上升，一哄而上，收市即期做四千萬元，隔日期〇四十五萬元，下午塲外交易，更高至二百萬元左右。美亞及大誠被面，均隨之而升，其餘各貨，行情雖稍帶好，不過交易仍稀。議價照舊未變動　紡建昨循例開紗　　廿支大發三三五〇萬元　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共售四八一件，合廿支紗九〇二件，申購單共二〇四張。　　該公司售紗價，昨仍運照紗管會本年一月十六日之規定議價，廿支紗第一級品質，最高價不得超過三四七五萬元。昨日開出大發脾廿支紗，係屬一級品質，開價三三五〇萬元。故一週來開紗議價，並未變動云。　　又訊：紗管會定本日下午三時，召開第二次委員會例會。　　新買活動　棉紗上揚　　昨日棉紗市况，以紡建開紗，廿支標準紗價提高五十萬元，並因銀根略見鬆弛，塲內新買活動，萎靡多日之市氣，驟告活躍，人心興奮，紛紛扒吸，惟各紗廠因價格不合，供售轉稀。致市上籌碼不够支配，喊價頻頻上揚。迨至最後，四十二支藍鳳細紗，較上日猛漲二百四十萬元，爲五千八百九十萬元。其餘各支組細紗，亦均回升五六十萬至二百四五十萬元不等。　　買氣轉旺布價盤升　　棉布市況，因萎靡多日，浮多斬殺殆盡，並聞外埠匯款有到，銀根稍趨鬆弛，批發行商均有選吸，客路寗波帮搜吸嗶嘰，本街同業及漢口帮抵補細布甚殷，買氣轉旺，行情盤旋上升。最後結果，十二磅龍頭等各細布，均回漲八萬五千元至四·五萬元不一，此外嗶嘰漂布，直貢細斜等，亦都軋升四·五萬至二·三萬之譜，惟上林布及元布市仍平疲。台糖運日問題　　台省維護航業主權　擬抵制日派船裝運　　〔本報訊〕頃悉：中央信託局正與日本方面治商將台灣糖業公司存糖約二萬噸，售與日本，並決定派船至台奘運，合省有關方面以台省自經收歸我國所右後，該省對外運輸口岸，在未經過法律規定開放之前，自應與我國其他各省未開放口岸同樣辦理，即已締約各國，在合省對外遝輸，尚不能直接派船前往，日本爲戰敗國且和約尚未簽訂，何能進行派船往台省裝運，實屬非法侵犯，該省方面極爲重親，刻正醞釀抵制日船到合奘運云。食糖疲跌未已　　　　昨糖市依然疲跌，公會劃盤現貨二四粗白一百六十七八萬元，小二三萬元。四半曰一百六十九萬元至六十六萬元，小三萬元。二〇中砂白一百六十三萬元，小二萬元。期貨較平，上落無多。汕提靑一百四十萬元，小三萬元。枝赤一百四十八萬五千元至五十萬，興化白袋裝一百七十二萬元至七十萬元，興赤一百五十四萬元至五十萬元，小一二萬元。海赤一百四十五萬五千元，小四五萬元。水東片靑一百二十八萬八，刁靑初開小數，勉站一百三，十八萬元。後小至一百三十三萬元，亦僅百數包交易，小五六萬元。內銷茶去化旺　　茶市洋莊交易，賡續寥若晨星，實以出口商胃納迄未轉佳，市面乃極呆滯。至於內銷花色，本街與客帮均有埀詢，情勢遂猶活躍。價格方面，因賣戶扳持甚勁，一致堅檔做開，且陳次祁門受貨缺關係，市氣再度向榮。捲烟肥皂回漲　　昨日捲烟市面，以銀根較鬆，同業及門莊帮抵補殷暢，散戶亦來進取，行情遂告上升。中途雖有外埠拋賣，卒因買氣濃郁，結果十支大英老刀兩烟比上日均回漲九十五萬至七十五萬元，其餘中外各烟亦均一致回俏。　　日用品肥皂行情，以連日下跌過鉅，乘低收吸者甚夥，結果固本箭刀比上日回漲二萬五千至三萬元，黃祥茂及光華新買胃健，軋升四萬至二萬元，火柴老牌平而難牌圓秀。實銷減少　木板一致下跌　　半月來木板呈膠着狀態，無甚榮辱。日來年關迫近，實銷突减，杉木條子大跌。自六千六百元跌至五千五百元。洋松亦跌七八千元，溫州四分松介柳介莫不紛紛削價，但成交寥寥。據一般觀察，陰暦年關，難望轉好。</p>

<p>文史六十年前洞庭山裏一個故事  胡適　　——林屋山民送米圖卷子序　　河南滑縣暴方子先生名式昭，在六十多年前到蘇州洞庭山裏做角頭司巡檢。巡檢是最小的官，很少有讀書人做齣。選位暴巡檢可右點特別，他的祖父暴大　是道光三十年和　　同榜的進士，他自己也是個讀需人。那時俞曲園先生正移家住在蘇州，暴巡　常和他往來，因此得認識當時在蘇州的一些名士，如易實甫　叔問諸先生。曲園集子裏有他贈暴君的詩歌，又有暴方子傳。暴家至今藏有曲園老人手札六十三件，可以想見當日兩家往來之密。　　曲園先生有一札裏說；此番計典，足下頗蹈危機。大魁（當日蘇州魁知府）已將「情性乖張，作事荒謬」八字奉贈矣。因笏翁（江蘇易藩台）力解，幸而得免。然不獲乎上，民不可得而治，深爲足下慮之。　　又一札說：　　今日適大魁來，託其遇事保全，承渠一口答應。但其意總嫌足下好事，又好出主見，非下僚所宜。鄙意湖山一席最宜吏隱。從此竟可不事一事，以文墨自娛，乃可相安也。　　又一札說：　　弟年前見中丞，力言足下之善，且言不悅之者衆，求其遇事保全。中丞允之。然終究上臺遠而府廳縣相離甚近。遠者之保全不能能敵近者之毀傷。一切謹愼爲宜。　　一個頂小的官偏要「好事，又好出主見」，在上司的心眼裏，這當然是「情性乖張，作事荒謬」了。果然光緒十六年十一月（公　一八九〇）暴君就被撤職了。　　他卸任後，因在洞庭西山，沒有錢搬家，甚至於沒有米做飯。山裏的老百姓聽見巡檢暴老爺丟了官沒有米下鍋，紛紛傳說，認爲奇事，十二月初十日陳巷村的鄕民送了幾担米，幾担柴到他家中，別的村子知這了都搶着送柴送米來，有些老百姓自己挑着柴米送來，也有和尚送栗子來，也有尼姑送蔬菜來。　　據暴君自記，送米的事「夢延至八十餘村，爲戶約七八千家。一月之中，收米百四石八斗，柴約十倍于米，他若魚肉鷄鴨糕酒果蔬之類，不可紀數。」這種人民公意齣表示，使暴君很感動。他對他的上司說：「此等贓私，非愚者莫能致，亦非愚者莫能得也！」　　光緒十七年（公曆一八九一）二月，洞庭山的詩人秦敏樹先生（散之）作「林屋山民送米歌」，並畫這幅「林屋山民送米圖」。曲園先生也爲此事作長歌，並爲這卷子作篆　題額。　　五十七年之後，方子先生的孫子暴春霧先生來看我，抱着這幅送米圖卷十來給我看。這卷子　有許多名人的筆跡，曲園先生與吳憲齊，吳昌碩，鄭叔問諸先生　手跡當然很可寳貴。但更可實貴的還有三件：一件是洞庭山各村人民送柴米食物的淸單，一件是上司訓斥暴君的公文，一件是他親自鈔存他自己答覆上司的票稿一件。這三件是中國民治生活史冊。我根據這些文件，又參者曲園先生的遺札，寫成這篇簡單叙述，作爲這個卷子的引子。　　（民國三十七年一月九夜）南詔史論  向達　　中國西南雲南貴州四川一帶，自古以來民族即甚複雜，彼此分立，不相統屬。其後事　開滇文化的勢力僅僅只到雲南的東部，西部及南部依然叛服無常，形同化外，六朝以至隋唐之際，土著大族有　姓者逐漸興起，雄踞雲南東部。唐高宗以後，雲南西部今大理附近，是一些稱為　。玄宗開元時六詔中最南的蒙舍認遂兼併五詔，統一全滇。蒙舍詔姓蒙氏，以於六詔中居於最南，故稱南詔，統一後仍臣服於唐，受磨封爲雲南王。天寳十載始叛唐自立，國號大蒙。自此以後，雖有偶然來歸的時候，唐朝始終不能控制，事實上建號稱王，是一個獨立齣國家。自天寳十載建大蒙國起，至昭宗天復二年爲鄭買嗣所滅止，凡亨國一百五十餘年。如自唐初蒙氏之始露頭角算起，則南認之雄踞西南，達二百七八十年，與李唐一代相終始。最盛時的疆域，北以今大渡河爲界，南有今安南的北圻一帶，東面兵力曾到今貴州遵義（唐名播州），以及廣西西部（唐屬邕管），西則今日的緬甸暹羅俱遭受過南詔的蹂躪。自八世紀初至九世紀末，儼然爲東南亞洲大國，與吐蕃分庭抗禮。　　因爲南詔疆域緊接唐邕管黔州益州諸地，南詔　　衰也就影響到唐朝的安危。懿宗以後南詔寇邊幾乎不間年歲，整個的唐朝都爲之騷動不寗。新唐書南蠻傳紀僖宗時盧携叙述當時南詔寇邊的情形，是：　　咸通以來，蠻始叛命，再入安南邕管，一破黔州，四盜西川，遂圍盧耽，召兵東方，戍海門；天下騷動，十有五年。賦輸不內京師者　半，由藏空虛。士死瘴厲，燎骨傳灰，人不念家，亡命為盜，可為痛心。　　南詔的　患旣然愈烈，於是徐州的兵也調來駐防桂林，久戍思歸，因有靡勛之亂，其後王仙芝黃巢即乘之而起。唐朝之亡其近因肇始於此。所以宋子京新唐書南蠻贊脫，「唐亡於黃巢，而禍基於桂林！」南兼聽和唐朝的關係可算是夠大的了！　　南詔和中國的關係雖然很重要，但因所包涵的民族太複雜，遺留下來的史料也不多，所以清朝一代治西北史地成爲風氣，而致力於南詔史硏究者却寥寥可數。只盧抱經　校過唐樊綽所著蠻書，沈子培也有蠻書注本之作。盧校現存南京國學圖書館，沈注存亡不可知。歡洲漢學家注意此一問題者有一九〇四年出版珊松譯　南詔野史（C.Sainoon,Nan-Tchao　ye　che,　Hiotoire　particuilere　du　Nan-Tchao,　Traduction　　une　Histoire　delmcien　yunnan）伯希和（P.　pelliot）交廣印度兩道考（依馮承鈞先生譯名）由，也討論到南詔歷史上的問題。日本學者有鈴木　討論六詔地望一文，發表於東洋學報中，近二十年來注意西歷史的人始逐漸多起來，業南學者如方國瑜徐嘉瑞范義田諸先生，中央研究院如淩純聲先生，對於南詔由硏究，都發表過很好的文章。今爲南詔史論，略考唐代紀載南詔諸史籍，　火餘光，聊資治南詔史者之談助面已。說十二月  王重民　　敦煌出的十二月只有一，篇今藏英倫大英博物院，編號爲斯六二〇八。十二月都全，書法也不錯，就是白字，譌字，及殘　的字不少。每月都是四句七言詩，是巾晚唐的作品。茲重爲校寫，念起來很覺通俗流利，所歌詠的正是唐人的「　怨」　　把一年分成十二月，理論上不能說「振古如斯」，至少在田骨文裏，已有十二月和閏月了！用十二月的次序來作詩歌，應該較五更十二時早的多。　　劉昭後漢書補志第八「祭祀志中」記章帝元和二年的事云：　　「又爲靈臺十二門，作詩，各以其月祀而奏之」。元和二年爲西曆第一世紀的第八十五年，這大概是量古的十二月詩了。　　樂府詩集卷四十九載月簡折楊柳歌，凡有十二月及閏月。折楊柳歌是很古的，自漢魏兩晋以來，演成了許多種的歌調。郭茂倩把這十三首編入「淸商曲　」。因爲沒有撰人姓名，就沒有標明他的時代。需他編排在「西烏夜飛「以後，「常林歡」以前，他大概認爲是「宋梁間」的作品　　四部叢刊影印金刻本李長吉歌詩卷一，載「河南府試十二月樂辭幷閏月」，也是十三首。這十三首又載入樂府詩集卷八十二的「近代曲辭一內。李賀雖說是能用白話來寫抒情詩的聖手，可是拿他這十三首和月節折楊柳歌來比較，便覺聲調的自然，和歌辭的有情趣，遠不及折楊柳了。李賀用的是七詩敦煌十二月也是七言，我們再拿敦煌本的十二月和李賀的十二月來比較，便又覺得敦煌本的十二月是活潑而而右生趣多多了。在這樣比較研究上面，最容易使人認識大眾通俗文學的價值。　　凡大文家的作品能被大眾歡迎的地方，是由於那些作品的修辭和命意都能通俗化。又如詩經或楚　，都曾長期的流傳在通俗社會裏，都曾經過無數的　名作家給他們修改過，潤色過，然後纔寫在紙上。今試　　過來看大眾的心理，大衆雖能欣賞好作品，雖說能修改潤色傳誦的作品使能通俗化，可是他們心中總是有個偶象，總願把自已喜愛的作品，附託在一個大名人之下。歷觀古今來許許多多僞託的作品，並不是有什麽惡意或善意，多半是在這樣環境之下產生出來的。現在我把北宋後期約一百年間，大衆所傳誦傳鈔的歐陽修的兩種十二月作例，來作更進一步的說明。　　梁任公先生有一篇記時賢本事曲子集，考知是蘇東坡的一個朋友楊元素（名繪竹，緜人。）編輯的，多「紀北宋中葉詞林掌故」。趙斐雲先生又加補訂，印人他的校輯宋金元人詞第五册。楊氏記歐陽修的十二月詞本事云：　　「歐陽文忠公文章之宗師也。其餘小詞，尤膾炙人口。有十二月詞寄漁家傲調中，本集亦未嘗載，今列之於此。前已有十二篇鼓子詞，此未知果公作否」？　　這一條見近體樂府卷二引「京本時賢本事曲子後集」，因知楊元素的原輯本是分前後集的。他的意思是說：前集事已經有了歐公的十二篇鼓子詞，今後集　又收了這寄調「漁家傲」的十二月詞，可是歌公的文集裏也同樣的沒有載入，不知道果然是他作的不是？可見歐公的後輩楊元素，僅僅在歐公的三四十年以後，便有點不敢置信了。　　四部　刋　印元刻本歐陽文忠公文集卷一百三十二，正載有那十二首鼓子詞，末有聞名跋云，云十年前見其全篇，今才記三句。乃永叔在李太尉端愿席上所作十二月鼓子詞。荊公之沒二紀，余目永平幕召還渦武陵，始得於州將李君誼。誼太尉猶子也。」又右朱松跋云：　　「政和丙申冬，（一一一六）余還自京師，過歙州太守濠梁許君頌之，席上見許君舉荊公所記三句。後十二年建炎戊申（一一二八）　　後四年辛亥紹興二月朔（一一三一）謾錄於此。」　　歐陽修死在熙寗五年（一〇七二），王安石死在元祐元年（一〇八六），「荊公卅年前見其全篇一，則至少嘉祐元年，（一〇五六）即是歡陽修還在世齣時候，那篇鼓子詞已經在社會上傳鈔傳誦起來了。從嘉祐元年至紹興元年（一〇五六——一一三一）朱松寫定的時候，凡七十五年間，從京師傳到湖南的武陵，又安徽的歙州，福建的長樂，也都在傳鈔傳誦，可見這十二首鼓子詞流傳之廣了！可是歐陽修自己却沒有把他編入文集內，後來補輯歐集的人，直到南宋初年還沒有補入。只右好事的楊元素右歐陽修死後不久，從傳鈔傳誦的波流裏，把他們一再編入他的時賢本事曲子集。可是他不敢置信是眞是　我現在更不能辨其眞僞，也不想辨其眞偽，我只想說明這寄在「漁家做調」的廿四首十二月，是經過大眾長期的傳鈔與傳誦，即是經過了許多無名作家修改過，潤色過，也就是說這廿四首都是已經通俗化了的，故能盛興一时。他齣文集喪還有二十首各種「漁家傲」（內有一首詠十月事，與鼓子詞同，）修辭雖佳，但不如道廿四首流陽。明白了這一點，方能辨自俗文學，方能認織俗文學。（卅六年十一月廿三日寫訖）論古錢幣三事  王毓銓　　王鑽　先生治史學多年，近年在紐約的美國古錢學會，硏究那邊敎　的中國古錢幣。甚多心得。最近他有信給我，信裏有三段專論古錢幣，都很有　味，所以我摘出來發表在「文史」上，　　內古錢幣學者的參考。（適）　　（甲）貝之用為貨幣想在殷末，其時甚貴重。故甲骨文股金文錫貝之數不過十朗，西屬中業以移骨貝，珞貝，石員，鋼貝諸倣製品先後出現。今世所請之蟻鼻錢（鬼臉錢）即爲銅貝最後之發展。此等銅貝想爲其時之副幣，流行頗廣。陜西中部，河南洛陽固始，江蘇銅山南京，山東滕縣，安　壽縣均有發現，且爲數甚多。江蘇鋼山發現者與「重一兩十四銖」　錢感於一銅尊中，明示戰國末與圖錢同時並行。（近Prof　William　ingram來信，謂近中國處只　州灣一帶產貝。其主要二品Cypraes　moneta及Cypraea　Annulus均見於股墟。董作賓先生前日過此，謂甲骨文中有「　目貝」，恐即Cypraea　Annulus）　　（乙）金幣始於西周，至春秋未戰國大盛，其時分三大系·刀系創於齊，行於齊，漸及燕趙。布系行於周晋，亦漸及於燕。「金鈑」系行於楚。燕受齊晋影嚮，刀布並行。戰國時齊之貨幣單位爲「化」（貨），三晋爲「　」（斤），周爲「　」（即爰？），楚爲「爰」，如「郢爰」「陳爰」。布系之中魏幣最盛，與齊刀分庭抗禮。瑛時謂「貨」爲錢，實沿齊地舊稱。史記越王世家末所附　朱公救子故事和史記孫叔敖傳那齊文字，活　小股，想是戰國時代的傳說而非史實，因此楚莊王鑄重錢和「楚王」對「三錢之府」之事都不可靠。事質上，楚國的幣制也沒有那樣早。　　（丙）美國古錢學會　有東漢銀　大小二，銀條五，共七件，均爲無債之責。銀　均有　警銘文：　　建和二年　銀匠　升　　上郡亭長　銀匠左宮　　正　公行　銀匠吳　　　此七件銀幣，極爲重要。第一，據文獻所紀，「白金」（銀）籌於元狩四年，將於元鼎三年。此等銀幣明示東漢一代行之。第二，自武帝而後學者每以爲終東漢一代郡國不鑄錢，應總中央，銀幣銘文所示與此相反。第三，東漢不同西漢，中央　錢，職在太僕。此可於銀條銘文中見之。「建武十七年五銖錢范」亦如此。第四，「亭長」必係「都亭長」，恐非一切亭長。亭長聯緝盜，今又　管鑄錢。凡此四大端，均與東漢一代典章制度有絕大關係，但均不見於史文。古幣之有助於研究古史者如此。、孫詒讓先生百年誔紀念  陳夢家　　瑞安孫仲容先生生於耶歷一八四八年，到今年恰恰一百年了。浙江大學文科研究所諸君爲紀念仲容先生，特地在浙江學報出了一個專號。這實在是很値得作齣事。我十餘年來常讀孫氏齣書，大大的佩服他的治學的方法，以爲晚淸治古文字者第一人。乾　以後，學者頗知注意銅器的收藏與流傳，但收藏的風氣雖盛，而眞正就金文爲古文字學和古史學的硏究者，並不多見。　五十年中，古文字學者多浙人。稍晚於孫氏，有上虞　振玉先生，海寗王國維先生。二氏者皆以遺老歿於民國期問，而於近代考古學與文字學的貢獻皆極大。惟二氏所治不限於文字，其眞能繼孫氏之後而專精於古文字學者，羅下以後，右秀水唐蘭先生。氏平生服膺孫氏分析文字偏旁之法，所以在他的「古文字學導論」中對於孫氏特加推崇。　　治文字學者當然必先讀漢代許愼的說文。許氏說文收容　　以秦漢的篆文爲主。他所錄的古文不過是六國時齊魯儒者的寫　，所謂孔子　　書。他所收的史整篇雖然時代較早，可惜此書早於許氏以前亡佚了一部分。這本說文，經過唐代李陽冰任意修改，已失本來面目。李氏自以爲　斯以後最知篆法的，他於說文賞是罪人。宋　三徐兄弟的說文，雖極力求復許書之舊，已經是不可能的了。淸代學者對於說文用力之勤，可說已盡了十分的氣力。無奈由說文面上追文字之源，尋求一字的本　，實　所不能。因此吳大徵作了「說文古　補」，想拿金文及其它占器物銘文來補說文中占文和　文的不足。此書　係極大，因它打破了向來視說文為硏究小學，惟一的材料與途徑，而用占文字的新材料夾印證說文。我們可以說，自宋以來治小學者即治說文者，他們所遵守的是許愼的「字例之條」。許氏的「字例之　」是不十分注意一切文字的時代前後、而將它們舖陳在一平面上。「　將」些字劃分爲五百四十部首，每個字又用六書的條例去分析。姑無論六書的條例對不對，這種處置是視文學爲一種靜的平面的材料。我們認爲這種方法是不對的，因爲文字是變的，是有縱齣踪迹可尋的。如何去尋求它的演變的過程，是必依賴於出土的古界物銘文。因爲此等銘文，其自身的時代是可以推求的。光緒廿五年以後，安陽出土了商代的甲骨文字，使我們得到更早的文字材料。孫仲容先生在他晚看看到這批新材料，首先加以詮釋，亦是蒙受此批新材料的益處的第一人。　　我們常知甲骨文字為現存最古的文字，它所記載的商代禮俗又是史籍上听最殘關不備的。在它初出土時，要試爲理詮必須具備下列的條件：是通說文，二是通金文，三是精熟古代禮制。此三條件正是孫氏於見到甲骨文字以前所具備的。孫氏於年十七八時，即嗜古文大篆，初讀宋人圖錄款識之書。廿五歲，作「商周金識拾遺」，訂正薛尚功阮元吳式芬三書，後來重訂爲「古籍拾遺」。同年，開始作「周禮正義」，直到五十二歲扌完成。此書爲淸代一大著作，自不待言。二十五歲後，時時作銅器銘文考釋，又訪問古蹟，搜求遺物，購取金文拓本。三十三歲，作「溫州古　記」。此　以前，氏嘗作「溫州經籍志」，以後又校補「東甌金石志」可，見氏就地取材，處處留意本鄉的文物。三十八歲，居京師，與當時金石家潘祖蔭介祺王繁榮盛昱費屺懷江標等論交。四十五歲，成「尚書駢枝一，四十六歲，成「墨子閒詁」，又聚讀書札記爲「札邊」，是爲孫氏經學子學和校譽學的著作。「周禮正義」告成之年正是甲骨出土之年，但制鶚的「鐵雲藏　」一直到光緒二十九年（先生五十六歲）才拓印問世。次年，氏作「契文舉例」，是爲硏究甲骨文字的第一著作。五十八歲作「名原一，自序曰「今略摭金文，龜甲文與說文古　，互相勘校，揭其岐異，以著省變之原；而會最比屬以尋古文大小篆沿革之大例。」這就是說，從商馬古文和大小篆，排比其年代而推尋文字演變沿革的大例。這是注意文字的動的縱線的踪蹟，比說文「字例之條「自是一大進步。從此才有古文字學以代替傳統的說文學。從前顏之推推重說文，以爲它「隱括有條例，剖析窮根據」。其實許氏只做到第一句話，直到孫氏才起始爲這兩句話下功夫。　　以上略述孫氏一生治學的經過，特別着重他對於古文字學的貢獻和勇　接收新材料的精神。回想甲骨初出，許多學者尚懷疑它是僞造者，直到民國十七年中央硏究院就地發掘後，尚有人寫專書來解甲骨之惑，信以爲膺造。此等皆因成見太深，又未嘗對新材料精心硏究，遂作任意的判撕。凡事開創難，守成易，今日金文甲骨已成爲史學文字學中重要的材料，而古文字學亦正方興未艾，我們不得不歸功於孫仲容先生。　　（三十七年一月淸華園）</p>

<p>自由談人謀不臧  文介　　本市的菜市里有一件很奇的事，就是不易買到新鮮的菜。硏究之下，發現了原因：據賣菜者說，市中菜販所售的菜都是　了水的。　了水不過是意圖加重菜的份量，藉此可以多賣幾個錢，這點尙可了解。可是在購菜者的立塲講，雅不願吃　了水的菜，情願多給錢，以貼補賣菜者不　水的損失。曾以意吿菜販，可是據菜販說，這個辦法　難實行，因爲同行都在　水，一人不　水，菜價勢必較貴，誰又願意出較多的錢來買外表一樣的菜呢。倒也言之成理。換言之，賣菜的必須把好好的菜弄得不好，始可維持他的營業生計，規規矩矩便不行。　　據說夫國的工商業有絕對的自由。有一位看慣了這種自由的美國人到歐洲去考察，見了歐洲工商業的實况，大不以爲然。他說：歐洲多數國家的商業是受政府或公會統制的。你要發售一種新式的商品，或是想設立一所新的零售商店，正不是一件容易的事，除非你在某一區域內以前曾設立過某一類的商店。在歐洲多數國家裏，人們所看重的是旣有工商業利益的分配，不是新機會的創造。這是說：舊存勢力一心想保持其勢力，凡有損於舊有勢力的雖有利於人羣的進步，却絕不許其生存。　　美國房荒很是　重，擄說原因有四，第一是政府賦稅太重，這點與本文無關，不必細說。第二是勞工方面把工資提得太高，故意减低工作的效能，極力反對利用足以節省人工的新方法新工其。於是工資支出要比戰前上漲百分之一百四十。第三，建築材料商串通一起，故意把木料磚瓦水泥等的價目定得不合情理的貴。你要買，就是這麼一個價錢，休想購得便宜貨。第四，承造商串通一起，故意把估價抬得很高，並加壓力於政府，使其頒佈規早，反對購用現成的牆壁，現成的浴室用具，反對以現代化的機械方法造房屋。或謂當初的馬車商如若也能像今日的營造商那樣反對使用汽事，政府必也可以聽命，汽車工業也就早已壽終正寢了。這是說：以現代的科學去建鞏房屋，必可比往昔造得更好更快更合算，只是爲了一部份人的私心，致使人們沒有廉價的房屋住。如果人們造不起房屋，依造屋爲生的人們又將何以爲生。然而此輩絕不想到道點。　　多年之前，英國的煤礦業工曾反對使用新式機器去採煤，理出是：第一，使用機器足以增加工人所冒的危險；第二，使用機器將使工人失去工作的機會，增加失業的人數。結果是沒有採用機器開礦。美國的煤礦不然，却是儘貴利用新式的機器以代替人工。結果是英國的煤礦落伍了。英國今日經濟局勢的蹣跚與這點事實不無關係。而今日美國煤礦每日的產量要比英國大六倍，煤價只及英國的三分之一，工人每日所得工資要比英國大三倍半。這是說：英國本可獲得廉價的煤，只以工人只顧一時本身的私利，以致害人害己。　　記得美國在大不景氣的時候，棉麥生產過剩—生產過剩竟會造成不景氣，這也是天下一等怪事—且說棉商麥商爲了棉麥生產過剩，價格大跌，爲維持價格起見，乃把大量棉麥借給他　，可是還　過剩，於是不惜把大量棉麥投諸大　，「物以希爲貴」，勉可造成「希」的現搬，把價格抬高，以保持棉商麥商的利益。竊思美國何嘗人人有足够的棉　麥，盡不把所謂「過剩」的棉麥無償贈送給他們呢？不過這點自然是一方面的想法，在另一方面說，人人都獲得了棉麥，誰又肯出了錢去買呢？大家不買，是即成了棉麥商的「不景氣」。這是說：美國本可人人足衣足食，只以少數商人必須藉一般人的「不足」以維護自身的利益，乃人爲的去造成了「不足」，致有棉麥投海的怪現象。　　這類　謀私利的例子，舉勝舉。爲私推諸極端，造刀槍便惟恐人們不殺人，軍火商惟恐國際間無戰爭，棺材店老闆惟恐人們不早死；棺材店老板的兒子為急於取得財產，　偷殺人，想亦不足為奇。　　綜上所述，「私利」非但足以阻止社會的進步，有時還會使一件好好的事或物變成壞的。「私利」是「進步」的罪人之一。紀錄  陳學玲　　運動家：「醫師，請問我的體溫怎樣？」　　醫生：「一百〇一度。　　運動家：「世界紀錄是多少？」廢此一說  雷紅　　有一種書獃子，讀書　到半角尖裏去，食而不化，其所作所爲，往往令人搖頭。此種人物，大都歡喜發表怪論，言而有中，倒還罷了只可惜是像上海的天文台預測氣候一樣，往往與事實相反，因此除了請這種獃子當一名圖書館管理員還適宜之外，對外發言，實在還是免開尊口的好。　　且說這種書獃子所發表的怪論，或爲預測，或爲推斷，大都不着邊際，無以折服人心。因此，如其萬一聽到，只能當作耳邊之風，吹過算了。我覺得怪論不一定需要反對，第一要看他立論的基礎是否堅實。例如英國的「世界評論」，發表過一篇戰略家哈德氏的文章，說是女人時裝之錢條，足以影響歷史，成爲政治的氣溫計，預算着人類世界的變化。哈德氏根據八百年來婦女服式的變遷，尤其是腰身，裙裾，頭飾三者，自法國大革命時代起，以迄第一次世界大戰時爲止，推論了怎樣的從她們服裝式樣的流變，而造成了政治的變革。　　這一種怪論，但他根據了事實，說出其所以然的道理，不能不使你有「存此一說」的想法。但另有一批好高驚遠　書獃子，　發共驚世駭俗的論調，祇圖把大名附麗於怪論之上，使世界上都知道某也斯，某也斯，無奈這怪論像一個輕氣球，儘管向上面散開來，總有破裂的一天。　　這種書獃子的例，在美國的科學界也不乏其人。如最近合衆社電傳，聖路加醫院硏究主任，前伊里諾大學病理學敎授潘德生博士預測，今年全球將遭數批疫癘之侵　，死者恐將超過平常時代。他的理由是疫癘與日班具有關係，日斑今年特別大，能影響氣候，促使人類疲勞云云。　　「日斑說」是恭聞已久的老生常談了，但試執路人而問之，你知道日斑和你有密切關係嗎？他一定搖頭。像這位病理學敎授　，就是日斑照在他當頭，未必會罹疫癘而死亡，因爲他有很好的環境，可以阻止疫癘之發生。所謂疫癘，往往與貧窮，汚穢，飢餓伴在一起。以「人謀之不臧」，而一手推到天道，眞是躱在屋子裏的書獃子的空論。我建議博士，旣有這種預測，何不把疫癘將發生的幾處人民，請他們到聖路加醫院裹來躱一躱，拯斯民於水火，豈非深得悲天憫人之旨？若是這位博士見死不救呢，我們只能廢此一說了。秦槍十客  百里　　秦檜有十客：曹冠以敎其孫爲門客，王會以婦弟爲親客，郭知運以離婚爲逐客，吳益以愛婿爲嬌客，施全以利刃爲刺客，李季以設醮奏章爲羽客，某人以治產爲莊客，丁　以出入其家爲狎客，曹詠以獻計取林一飛爲說客，初止有此九客耳，秦旣死，葬於建康，有蜀人史叔夜者，懷鷄絮號慟墓前，其家大喜，因厚遺之，遂爲弔客，足十客之數。見陸放翁老學庵筆記。逍遥花  陳慎言　　第九章　洩漏機密（五一）　　綺紈在濟南靄演期滿，按着靑島光　戲院，又派人前來邀請，綺紈　到　　的電報，本想就回去，後來一想，這是好機會，趁此時機，再撈一筆款，將來生活費，更有着落，因她早已看準要組織一個美滿家庭，非金錢充裕不可，當下便回電渚齋說明須赴青島露演，渚齋心裏雖不痛快，也無可如何，因爲旣和鳳箏脫　關係無家可歸，悶着無聊，祇有常到　　家裏消遣。雲卿認爲渚齋和鳳笙離婚，當然是注意在她身上，渚齋每來，總是極力款待，討他歡心，不過雲卿是個細心人，知道鳳笙這一關雖已打通，渚齋尙有父母在堂，這一層難關，還須用種種方法，才能度得過去，因此緣故，和渚齋雖日見接近，說話和一切行動，却有一種限度。渚齋目的原不在雲鄉，祗虛興委蛇，外面保持一種親密情態，暗地裹不斷去電靑鳥，催促綺紈迅速回來，因爲他知道在這情勢之下，　能矇驅雲鄉一時，若是相處過久，所受雲卿恩意愈厚，將來反感愈大，所以有時二人爲情感所衝動，渚齋必極力克制，不敢逾出範圍。雲　見他能守禮自重，心裏倒很欽佩，祇認他也是和自已一樣，為　慮以後離關，不能不一切謹愼，免留遺憾，所以他二人言語舉動一切，倒比從前更爲客氣，就是二人在屋內，旁無他人，也祇談些極平常的話，絕無私語。在渚齋方面，心有所戀，不能不愼重，在雲卿方面，爲著　　一以後難關，也不能不預留餘地，彼此雖然日日見面，日日談心，至於將來如何結合，都不敢輕易出口。如此一連一個半月，綺紈已由靑島載譽歸來，她這時已是名利雙收，據她報吿，在濟南靑島兩地，祗演紡棉花，所得代價，至少可買一所很講究的房子，希望渚齊替她物色一所住宅。渚齋一心一意，祇盼綺紈回來，和她到外埠，旅行結婚，不想第一日和綺紈見面，綺紈吿訴他　狀後就託他買房子，這是出於渚齋意外的，心裏非常不贊成，口裏却不便說出，祇是拖延着不給她進行。杜魯門的風趣  銅　　時在一九四五年，有一著名影星在華盛頓的劇院觀劇。她坐在一個包廂的前排；在她背後一排，坐着一對夫婦，非常安靜地，一點也沒有架子。　　在休息時間，有不少觀衆發現了女明星，特到包廂裏來訪問，碰到了坐在後排那對夫婦。訪問者中的一個女人仔細地看了那男人一眼，喘息著說：「天呀，你是不是副總統啊？」　　其時的副總統杜魯門先生乾脆回答道：「不是，祗是在下的面孔和副總統雷同而已。」紫貂大衣興沙丁魚  津津　　紫貂大衣與沙丁魚是兩件絕不相干的東西。不過在不久前看過好莢塢某喜劇片的，也許可以記得這是片中丑角弗文克斯，對扮演一個女作家角色的諷刺。原來這位女作家自奉儉薄，平日以吃罐裝沙丁魚的時候居多。可是她却不惜預支幾個月的薪水，買了一件昂貴的紫貂大衣。因此丑角指指她說：「你外面穿的是紫貂大衣，肚子內裝的是沙丁魚，正太有趣了。」如果將這句話，用符合我國國情的語法來說，彷彿是：「你外面穿的是定價二千萬元的畢挺西服，肚子內是陽春麵。」當可使讀者有進一步的親切之感。　　我想這句話，多少含有幾分人生哲理在內。一個薪水階級的丈夫容或會不管家中的空米箱，買了一套西裝料回來，而他的太太同樣會將丈夫給她買魚肝油的錢省下，去買了一瓶旁氏白玉霜，雖則魚肝油能保持她的健康美，在美容上的價値，也許更大。我覺得人生往往量一連串的夢境，我們常常希望得到一些比較昂貴與力所不逮的東西。在一個夢實現以後，第二個夢緊接着前來。足下看了那個穿了二千萬元的西服，身畔幾乎不名一文的年輕人，以爲是一個糊塗蟲，但是這却能滿足他講究食品營養價値以外的一種願望呢。文章的深淵  寄漠　　我有機會遇到一些愛好寫作，而尙在學習階段的年輕人，常常勸他們不要孜孜兀兀，鍥而不舍。如果他們想以寫作爲終生職業，可是家道並不豐裕的話，這更是一件使不得的勾當。　　記得我的一位學習法律的業師，若干年前，從英國回來，他的作品嘗在英國某小說獎中入選，一時頗欣羨英國文人的優閑生活，回國後，亦想依樣畫葫蘆，賣文爲生，旣能發揮錦繡才華，又可博得社會的重視。可是接着一看我國的情形不對，文人淸苦異常，他趕緊改變宗旨，在司法界供職，雖說兩袖淸風，但比那種生活沒有保障，絞盡腦汁的生涯，終究好上了幾倍。　　說起來寫文章還有不少慘事。家中無米下鍋，等着文章換夾的錢救急，偏遭文思滯澀，固然是一件苦事，而筆者在一位出版家那裏聽來的實事，更令人毛髮悚然。有這樣一位精通中英文字的作者，受聘於某書局，將我國四庫全書中的一部份，讀成英文，一字一句，煞費推敲的苦心，費了二年的心血，卒吿完成。我不知道他得到了多少代價，不過書成之後，隔不了多少時候，他的前額生了一個腦瘤，向前突出，連眼珠也睜不開來，從此就成了廢人，我想這興用腦過度，不無關係吧。　　自然，目的在陶冶性情，或以文章爲敲門磚的著作，另作別論，然而文人千須謹防稍一不愼，　入文章的深淵，以致不能自拔。動物的預感  駝　　貓知道在天將雨的時候，抓洗自己的耳後部。但在喀拉哈里大沙漠的貓便沒有這種預感，僅在雷雷雨交作前變得心神不定，漫無目的地跑來跑去。　　騾子也是氣候的預測者，牠們的長吼表示雨即將來臨。　鼠在降雪之前趕快把洞穴遮掩。在山區的羊當風雨來臨的時候，　自動更換嚙草的地點，　到山中可以避風的一處。蜜蜂也是對於氣候變化　的感覺極爲靈敏的動物，牠們不肯飛出蜂窠，就表示將有潮濕的氣候來臨。吳鳳興「吳鳳杮」  蔭祥　　台灣同胞平素所崇仰的人物，除了鄭成功之外，還有一個吳鳳，這是百餘年前的一位殺身救人的公務員，他的事蹟感化了番人，拯救了多少生命，而且改易了野蠻風俗。　　吳鳳是福建漳州和平縣人，從小就跟隨父母到台灣經商，住家在諸羅縣打貓堡番仔潭莊，就是現在的嘉義市近阿里山麓的地方。那時滿淸治台腐政，强制地劃分漢番的興錢，番人住在山上，統稱爲高山族，和漢人不僅不相往來，而且胸懷仇忿，如官塲有事，則用一位通事來傳譂。　　康熙六十一年間，有一位李通事，祇知苛捐虐政，終於爲番人殺了。而吳鳳因爲時時上山做販賣　材的生意，和番人之間很和脖，在他二十四歲的時候，被任爲通事，於是專事撫番，力行仁政，於是番人都很悅　，視爲父母之官。　　聚居在阿里山的番人朱奥島於，素來是很兇暴的，而且有一種野蠻的風俗，呌做「出草」，又呌「人頭獵一，日本人名之曰「首狩」，就是要殺異族，斬了首級去祭　。這原是古代原始人的野性行爲，殺人算是他們一種勇敢的表現，相傳而成爲習慣的迷信了。　　阿里出番人常常「出草」，在近境的漢人往往被害，吳鳳千方百計地勸導，經四十餘年的苦口婆心，沒有多少效果。到乾隆三十四年八月一日的那天，阿里山番人們到嘉義埔莊社口地方的衙門來作同樣的要求。吳鳳又是煞費心計地規勸，但是沒有結果，看看日期已經迫近了，便在八月九日的那天，召宴番人們，在談笑之間，暗示人類的不可自相殘殺，殺戮無事決不能認爲這是一種英勇的行爲，但是番目不爲所動，仍堅決要求。吳鳳實在沒有辦法，祗得說：「如果你們一定耍這樣做，那末只能供給你們一個人，僅僅乎一個人，明天在衙門附近徘徊着的朱衣紅巾的人便是。「於是番人們歡笑而去。第二天，八月十日，一羣番人帶了腰刀長矛，背着弓箭等來到衙門附近，果然看見有一個朱衣紅巾的人在路上徘徊，於是番人們就不由分說砍他的腦袋，然後仔細一看，纔知道被殺的，正是自己所景仰的吳鳳—大家驚嚇得不知所措，棄屍逃了。　　吳鳳在事前曾吿訴他的家人說：「我爲革除番人「出草」惡習，即使拋却頭顱，在所不惜。我相信天道常存，番人殺我天必降禍於番人。」據說他死後果然大雨傾盆，積水番地，疫癘猖熾，因此番人們恐怖而痛悔，決心從此革除這種「出草」的惡俗，挽救了不少人命。吳鳳死的時候，年已七十二歲了。　　世人頌讀之餘，建吳鳳祠於當年通事的衙門舊址。據說吳鳳的住宅距離殉職處，只有數步。吳鳳之被殺，就在由家赴衙門的路上，他的遺骸就葬在就義處，卵石爲壘，砌成墳墓，上樹石碑，題着「義人吳鳳就難處」，四周有圍欄。　　吳鳳之死，上聞於帝，嘉其義，便改諸羅爲嘉義。吳鳳廟在離市二十餘里的阿里山附近，在靑山碧野間建築了赭紅色的廟宇，廟額寫作「阿里山忠王祠」，大殿上的　寫着「吳鳳廟」三字，中間是吳鳳和他的夫人神像，吳鳳被塑成武將式，披戴着全副盔甲，騎馬舉刀，非常英武。　　去年九月二十四日，正當農曆八月十日，是吳鳳的殉職紀念日，祭典熱烈。各界都參加，人民赴廟拈香致敬者，非常擁擠。吳鳳的第八代裔孫吳吼，年紀也已經七十一歲了。典祭大禮由宓市長主持，因爲追懷這一位偉大的公務員，使人永世不忘，決議提請中央，訂定這一天爲「公務員節」。　　接着便舉行「吳鳳柿」的命名典禮，高唱「吳鳳歌」。　　「吳鳳柿」是從今起的名字，這種柿子是熱帶的產物，廣東人稱之爲「人心果」，原產在南美洲北部和西印度諸島，現在東西兩半球各熱帶地方都盛相栽植了，考係西班牙人帶到馬尼刺，一九一九年之間，日本人再從爪哇帶到合灣來，在合南高雄一帶栽植很多。枝葉部蓄有黏液，果實有球形，卵形，橢圓形三種，大多像馬鈴薯，皮粗大，生時茶色，隨着成熟而逐漸由黃而淺紅，肉作深紅色，多汁而甜美，有些像柿子，可生食，可做果醬，未成熟時含有單寗分，爪哇的土人製成藥品，可以治痢疾。（寄自台北）社會服務徴才求職　　中華職業敎育社上海職業指導所，近代各方徵求下列人才，應徵者請至應蕩路（華龍路）八十號該所面洽。　浙江某校高中英文及數學理化敎員各一人，備照片。　浙江某救濟院保育員一人，助產士出身者尤佳。　某生產合作社女裁縫一人，以能裁製男女成人及童裝者爲合格，如能西裝者更佳，待遇論件計算。　某廠駐港副經理一人，以留學英美能英粤語，富有商業　驗者爲合格，備自薦書及照片。　　〔求職〕　某君，三一歲，湖南大，西北工學院紡織系畢業，曾任紡織廠技士技師，軍需署技正。　某君，三四歲，江四人，無綫電工程學校畢業，曾任電訊總隊技士電工課長。　某君，三五歲，安微人，東亞醫學院二十三年畢業，曾任醫院兒科內科主任。　某女士，二四歲，浙江人大學肄業，擅長英文打字，曾任初中英語教員。　某君，三三歲，浙江人擅長中文打字，有二年以上經驗。　某女士，二二歲，浙江人，中學畢業，曾任小學中級級任三年，檢定合格。　某君，三二歲，湖北人，曾受事務管理專門訓練，有五年以上經驗。　某君，二六歲，鎭江人，高小程度，願任工友職務。　　電倍問答　上海電信局主答　　（暨南大學　志豪問）聞貴局開放交際眞蹟電報，未知性質及拍發手續如何？鄙人欲電賀漢口友人結婚，該項電報是否適用？　　（答）所謂交際眞蹟電報，就是　　電　的交際電報，是把交際電報的辦法通用在眞　電報上，一切慶賀，弔唁，慰問，通候等交際性質的電報都可使用交際眞蹟電報，這種電報可由發報人隨意親筆書寫，並可附贈禮券，照眞蹟電八折收費，投送時間爲適應收報人需要起見，自上午八時起至下午九時止，拍發時祇需向營業員說明交際眞蹟，以資識別外，其他和眞蹟電報相同。目前因機件缺少，僅開放上海南京一路，漢口尙朱通達。　　（長春路姚樂問）貴局出版各項電信特刋，介紹業務，闡述綦詳，唯鄙人事先未曾發覺，初刋幾期，均吿缺少，能否補寄，以供參考。　　（答）本局電信刋物，因印行無多，外界需紫甚衆，早經發罄，閣下所請，歉難照辦，唯今後出版自當按期寄奉。　　（林森中路李建彰問）貴局行動電局路線如何？鄙人住於長壽路大自鳴鐘，應向何處拍發較近？　　（答）行動電局於上午九時半至下午四時半經常循　於中正東路，中正北一路，長壽路，南京西路，長壽路，林森中路，復興中路海齊路之間，貴處請在十一時至十二時間於大自鳴鐘郵局前拍發較近。</p>

According to the original article: "These measures shall not apply to US warships temporarily before matters concerning enemy surrender and repatriation are concluded."

<h3>Issue of Large Denomination Taiwan Dollars: Authorities Considering Carefully</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 23rd] According to various reliable sources, the issue of 500-yuan banknotes by the Bank of Taiwan is only a matter of timing. The Research Office of the Bank of Taiwan convened a symposium of 16 experts to discuss the lending to private enterprises and the issuance of large denomination banknotes. Although there were no definite results, it was generally believed that if loans to private enterprises were to be opened up, it would be necessary to issue large denomination banknotes. The central government has limited the issuance of banknotes by various banks to 17 billion, and it has already reached more than 15 billion. However, the authorities are considering whether the issuance of large denomination banknotes will affect commodity prices or even cause opposition from the provincial people, shaking people's hearts. Therefore, the timing and technology of the issuance will be carefully discussed. It is reliably learned that the issuance of these large denomination banknotes will depend on the success of Mr. Bei Zuyi's fundraising in the United States. If the loan is successful, the appearance of large denomination banknotes will still have to wait.</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Paralyzed: No End in Sight for the Turnover</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 23rd] The turnover of the new and old Hebei provincial governments is nowhere in sight. Currently, the heads of various provincial committees and departments are staying in Peiping (Beiping) and have not returned. In Baoding, apart from a few administrative accounting personnel busy preparing for the turnover, all administration has virtually come to a standstill. Various circles and legal entities in Baoding believe that the paralysis of the provincial government is affecting military-political coordination and is of great importance. They have sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang, Premier Zhang, and Commander-in-Chief Fu, requesting them to forward telegrams to the newly appointed Chairman of Hebei Province, Chu Xichun, and the heads of various provincial committees and departments to take office in Baoding as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 23rd] It was announced on the 23rd that General Chu Xichun had telegraphed from Pan Yang that he would soon come to Peiping (Beiping) to take office as Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government.</p>

<h3>Elections of Legislators Across the Country: All Completed Successfully</h3>

However, the voters in the districts outside Zhonghua Gate were still very crowded. Most candidates made their best efforts to seize the final opportunity to be elected.

Although the leaflets and slogans on the streets had lost their effectiveness, the election propaganda in front of the polling stations continued. Today, all polling stations followed the instructions of the election headquarters and made many improvements. The voting situation was even better than yesterday.

<h3>North China to Test Village Mergers: Eastern Hebei to Implement First</h3>

<h3>US Plots to Occupy Japan Long-Term? Communist Radio Broadcast Denounces MacArthur</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City News] It was heard here on the 23rd from the CCP radio station broadcasting from "a certain place in northern Shaanxi" that the Japanese occupation authorities had claimed that a "secret Japanese government" was attempting to undermine the Allied occupation policy. However, in fact, the "secret government" was only a tool of the Supreme Commander MacArthur. The CCP broadcast claimed that MacArthur was conspiring with former military leaders and frustrated diplomats to create an atmosphere of secret conspiracies in order to indefinitely prolong the US occupation of Japan. MacArthur is "Public Enemy Number One." The United States is deliberately launching a movement to abolish the veto power of the four Pacific powers and is supporting an eleven-nation peace conference so that a peace conference with Japan cannot be convened. The red radio station also claimed that "Shanghai commentators have said that the entire plan of US imperialism is to occupy Japan for a long time as a base for aggression against Eastern countries." The United States is also demanding to obtain naval and air bases in China, Japan, and Korea so that its military power in the Far East can be continued. (A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the afternoon of the 23rd said that informed sources in Tokyo believe that the CCP broadcast's accusation that MacArthur was attempting to prolong the occupation period was "completely wrong." MacArthur has repeatedly requested the convening of a peace conference and advocated the early withdrawal of the occupation forces. Reliable sources say that MacArthur has not changed his original intention, and all previous documents are still valid.)</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department has prepared to close the US Consulate in Changchun because it is almost completely surrounded. Consul Xue Pengshi has been ordered to safely evacuate all American residents from the besieged city. State Department officials believe this is the first step in the final order for Xue Pengshi to close the consulate and withdraw to Shenyang. However, the closure of the US Consulate in Changchun is only a temporary expedient, pending improvement in the situation. The US Embassy in Nanjing has the right to act accordingly in this matter. The closure of the consulate in Changchun will or should be ordered by Ambassador Stuart.</p>

<h3>Secretary of State Marshall Announces U.S. Aid to China Bill Ready; Thorp Officially Hosts Our Delegation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Marshall announced today that a substantive aid to China bill has been drafted by the State Department but is not yet ready to be submitted to Congress for discussion. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, previously sent a letter to Marshall requesting that he immediately submit an aid to China plan. Marshall's reply has been released by Bridges. It states that the aid to China bill still needs to be submitted to the National Advisory Council and the Bureau of the Budget for review. It can be completed within this week, at which time President Truman can submit it to Congress for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] State Department officials say there are indications that the aid to China plan may be submitted to Congress within two weeks. They acknowledged that the figures in the plan could be larger than Marshall's previous estimate of $300 million, but declined to disclose the specific figures, calling it a secret. It is generally believed that even if it exceeds $300 million, the amount will not be too much.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Assistant Secretary of State Thorp officially hosted the entire members of the Chinese technical delegation to the United States at the government's Blair House guest house on the 22nd. Bei Zuyi, Li _, Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, other Chinese officials and financial experts were invited to attend.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Commercial Implementation Measures of the Economic Program</h3>
<p>The implementation measures of the economic reform have been drafted by various ministries and commissions and revised and approved by the National Economic Commission. The full text is well-organized, but lacks focus, resembling a detailed account. At a time when everything is being taken care of, and all wastes are being taken care of, at least during the period when athletes are suppressing chaos and the military comes first, what is the actual possibility seems to be a very big problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, although this implementation method is said to be implemented, in fact, there are still too many ideal and abstract views, and there are still few concrete plans on how to implement it. Therefore, the true implementation method is that a separate proposal must be drawn up on the ground. Thirdly, there are many conflicts between the proposed method and the current actual situation: Whether there is enough space to implement it is still a question. Now, please briefly interpret the draft implementation plan for the commercial part to get a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many restrictions on the transportation and sales of many goods, including restrictions on regions and types. In addition, there are restrictions on internal bandits, limited quotas for distribution, and procedures for permits, not to mention various practical difficulties in the monetary system and transportation. Judging from the pain recently expressed by the petition representatives from the north in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, it can be seen that the exchange of domestic goods, in addition to unconditionally facilitating and promoting it, should not be subject to any restrictions. The draft stipulates that "the exchange of materials between economic zones in the country should...formulate a general plan and implement it." We don't know how this general plan for exchange should be formulated? What is its content? What is its purpose? How should the economic zone be interpreted? After adding various "plans", will the exchange of materials actually become the blockage and separation of materials? This can only be left to future facts to prove.</p>
<p>The draft repeatedly mentions loans, such as "For export materials, especially products, a regular linked loan system should be established from production and manufacturing, inland transportation, and entrepot sales." It also says, "The conditions for packing loans, export exchange, and insurance for export materials should be appropriately relaxed by the handling bank or company." These are of course the nectar that export industrialists and merchants are seeking, but unfortunately the drafters do not seem to have noticed the government's current policy of tightening credit and tightening money. Otherwise, how can this series of regular linked loan systems be established?</p>
<p>There are also several items that sound very good, such as: (1) Government agencies and organizations should limit the use of domestic goods for public items; (2) Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and prohibit their circulation in the market within a time limit; (3) Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and prohibit supporting their development within a time limit, etc. However, the collection of local specialty donations and the prohibition of the export of certain goods, this supreme power is already held by the smallest unit such as the county government, let alone higher-level governments? Isn't it obvious that the central and provincial governments have repeatedly issued orders and five-equal regulations for the free circulation of rice and grain, and as long as the procedures are complete, local governments can clearly tax local specialties?</p>
<p>As for public items, limiting the use of domestic goods, whether this is feasible or not, just a casual visit to any agency or organization will give a clear conclusion. We don't believe that relying on this empty implementation plan can reverse the bad trend of worshiping foreign goods!</p>
<p>According to current laws, luxury goods are originally prohibited from being imported. However, luxury goods are piled up everywhere and flood the market, which is a fact that everyone can see. Although the authorities have declared strict crackdowns on smuggling, and the relevant industries (such as the silk stocking industry, etc.) have shouted loudly, demanding a ban, and although we deeply sympathize with it, it is difficult to say and even more difficult to do. The authorities in various places seem to be at a loss for these smuggled goods, whether they are about to be imported or have already been imported, and can only stand by and watch, ignoring them. Isn't it true that shark fins and sea cucumbers can still be seen and eaten everywhere in big cities and small cities? Even if they are not eaten in bars, they are regarded as treasures in official residences! Aren't other various luxury goods displayed in the counters of various stores in a grand manner?</p>
<p>Substitutes for offsetting imports should be supported as much as possible, which is also a common sentiment. The focus of the problem is whether the import quota of raw materials for manufacturing such substitutes can be relaxed? Can the required power be exempted from restrictions? Can the excessive burden it bears be appropriately reduced? The relevant industries have been running around and appealing for these issues, which have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers, but have government officials been moved by it? For example, two or three paper mills have already ordered new paper-making machines, each of which can produce thirty to fifty tons of paper per day, and have also ordered machines that can make wood pulp, but the application for foreign exchange to purchase the machines has been pending for half a month without any progress. We sincerely hope that due to the implementation of this implementation plan, this problem can be properly resolved.</p>
<p>The draft also advocates that, when necessary, the government should purchase export goods to compete for the international market and designate several important items to promote the joint operation of imports and exports. This is also what everyone is eagerly hoping for. At a time when foreign exchange is exhausted and materials are scarce, there is really no reason to shelve the so-called joint import and export method. At a time when exports are stagnant and cannot be promoted, there is really no reason for the government's export goods purchase policy to continue to watch and not seriously and effectively promote it. Looking at the implementation plan for the commercial part, it is permissible to say that these two plans are the most important. However, the proposed barter plan originally only advocated that it be tried out by the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office to correspond with international cooperative organizations. We believe that it is simpler and easier to expand purchases and implement the import and export chain method.</p>
<p>In terms of developing domestic trade, the draft advocates urging enterprises to re-evaluate fixed assets to absorb new funds, which seems to take this problem too lightly. Why can't existing enterprises expand, and why can't emerging enterprises develop? From a superficial point of view, it should be attributed to the unreasonable factors of currency, interest rates, transportation, and labor. From a long-term perspective, it must be extended to the need for clarification in military, political, and social aspects. Although it is said that dealing with things on a case-by-case basis has its own scope, and should not be uniformly involved in commercial issues, it can be asserted that encouraging investment and rewarding enterprises should not start solely from re-evaluating fixed assets.</p>
<p>In short, generally speaking, the content of the implementation plan for the commercial part is inevitably poor and lacks far-sighted construction. The various suggestions it makes are mostly stale and follow the old ways, and are either still practically unworkable or are trivial and do not contribute to the overall situation. It does not touch on any of the various obstacles currently encountered in commerce, except for empty words that there should be no restrictions on the export of goods and no special donations and taxes should be levied. It seems that the government has not yet fully understood the pain felt by industrialists and merchants, which is particularly disappointing. It seems that this article is called an implementation plan, but its result is nothing more than adding a kind of information for reference to the economic literature!</p>

<p>Ministry of Justice Ensures People's Personal Freedom [This Newspaper Nanjing 23rd Dispatch]</p>
<p>In the past, it was often heard that constitutional police organs arrested and detained criminals beyond the legal time limit. According to the Ministry of Justice, now that the implementation of the constitution has begun, the protection of people's personal freedom should be handled in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 8 of the Constitution. Moreover, the Habeas Corpus Act has been implemented since March of the 35th year of the Republic. According to the provisions of this law, if the court considers the reasons sufficient after receiving the application for habeas corpus, it can apply to the arresting agency for habeas corpus. Since its implementation, the courts have been able to handle it seriously. Now the ministry is giving instructions and supervision at any time to achieve the effectiveness of the full implementation of the habeas corpus system. As for the recent rumor that the Shaanxi High Court has sent prosecutors to police stations to work, this is not related to the implementation of the habeas corpus system. According to the measures for liaison between prosecutors and judicial police organs in the execution of their duties, in order to strengthen the liaison between the police and prosecutors and to facilitate command and control, it is acceptable for the court to send prosecutors to police stations to work, and this liaison measure has now been widely implemented and is universally applicable to all courts.</p>

<p>Western European Alliance Has Begun to Prevent Soviet Control of the European Continent</p>
<p>Bevin Announces British Foreign Policy [United Press London 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that British foreign policy advocates that Western European countries unite to deal with the Soviet Union to prevent it from controlling the European continent by cruel means, and the time is ripe to launch this plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Negotiations to establish a Western European alliance have begun, and the first participating groups will be Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The overseas territories of the participating countries will also become organizational members of the alliance. Foreign Secretary Bevin announced the start of the above negotiations when he delivered a long speech reviewing British foreign policy in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 22nd. He said, "We will launch this negotiation with our French allies and Western European countries. I hope to sign treaties with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, so that the treaty we signed with France will become an important core of Western Europe. We will unite other European countries with historical ties, including the new Italy, to participate in this great alliance." Bevin also warned the Soviet Union that playing with fire in international affairs is a dangerous move. But at the same time, he stated, "What the British government is doing now is not aimed at the Soviet Union or any other country, but we have the right to organize the Western kindred spirits, just as they organize the Eastern kindred spirits." He also said, "I believe that the time is ripe to consolidate the land opportunities in Western Europe. We are now formally proposing to France to form a political alliance. We will maintain the closest ties and strive for a closer union between the two countries. The time has now come for us to find ways to develop relations with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Our representatives in Brussels, The Hague, and Luxembourg have been ordered yesterday to consult with French representatives to launch this negotiation. It is no less important for Italy to participate in the Western European alliance than other Western European countries. Western European representatives are cooperating quickly and effectively, which is a good phenomenon. We must do our best to promote the spirit of cooperation. Here, I must point out that this alliance cannot be limited to Europe for geographical reasons. The power of Europe has extended to the whole world, so our eyes must look beyond Western Europe. The first thing that comes into view is Africa, where the great responsibilities are shared by South Africa, France, Belgium, Portugal, and our country. The Soviet Union Actively Seeks Control in Eastern and Western Countries, and Such Attempts Will Continue to Emerge. We must also pay attention to other overseas territories, especially Southeast Asia, where the Netherlands occupies an important position. These European organizations must be supported economically. Therefore, the British Commonwealth and its territories, as well as the overseas territories of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Portugal, should maintain the closest possible cooperation. These lands contain huge resources that can be fully developed, and their raw materials, food, and other resources can provide great benefits to the people of Europe and the world. This plan does not conflict with the United States and the Soviet Union, which also have huge resources. To balance Europe's payments, its resources must be developed and used, and exchanged with each other in a suitable manner. Now, the socio-economic development in the overseas territories responsible by Britain is being actively promoted. Other Western European countries with overseas territories will join Britain in the same task to unite the strength and opportunities of hundreds of millions of people to develop resources from Europe through the Middle East, Africa, and all the way to the Far East, making the world richer and safer. We believe that our friends in the Commonwealth will be willing to cooperate with us." Bevin then mentioned relations with the Soviet Union, saying: The Soviet side has revealed its policy of doing its best to enable the Communist Party to gain control in Eastern and Western Europe. I believe that the Communist Party's plan is being actively promoted in every country. We have discovered these tricks in Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and recently in Romania. According to the information we have obtained, similar attempts will appear in other places soon. The problem is not in the organization of Finland or other countries, but in the Soviet Union's control of Eastern Europe. The Soviet border has in fact extended to Stettin, Trieste, and the Elbe River, but it is still not satisfied. In Greece, they believe that Britain and the United States will eventually feel tired, and then they can safely recognize the government of the Communist rebels, so that the Greek people will be forced to accept the Communist government, and finally incorporate Greece into the Communist system. The problem in Greece is not about which form of government to elect, but about incorporating Greece into the Soviet sphere of influence at all costs. This is a dangerous situation and a typical great power policy. Special Warning on the Greek Issue The United Nations agency has been mocked by Greece's northern neighbors. I must solemnly warn here that such provocative actions may lead to serious developments. These events should be resolved based on the resolutions of the UN General Assembly, and not by promoting civil war or recognizing the Marcos regime. Since we have accepted other resolutions of the UN General Assembly, we must of course also accept the resolutions on Greece. It should be known that playing with fire in international affairs is an extremely dangerous thing. Conducting psychological warfare against small countries will make it more difficult to reach an agreement. Propaganda is by no means a way to solve international problems. Other key points mentioned by Bevin are as follows: Iraq: I and the Prime Minister of Iraq will never sign any document that disregards the will of the Iraqi nation. I would like to assure my Iraqi friends that we will face common problems, whether they are related to defense or socio-economic development. I sincerely hope that this carefully drafted treaty will serve as a model for the development of defense arrangements in the Middle East. Foreign Treaty: I will discuss the new situation with the Prime Minister of the Foreign Treaty. Foreign Prime Minister Ferzal will come here at the beginning of next month. Egypt: I sincerely hope that the past atmosphere of disagreement with Egypt can be eliminated, but it will still take some time. Bevin also said: These steps in the Middle East and Western Europe are in line with the principles of the United Nations. When the disputes of the Four Powers are resolved and the will of peace is established, the above-mentioned steps can be adapted to the principles of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Churchill Agrees with Bevin's Anti-Soviet Proposition [This Newspaper Report]</p>
<p>London, 23rd Broadcast: Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, supporting the foreign policy announced by Bevin yesterday, urging Western democratic countries to do everything possible to avoid war, and advocating that practical negotiations be conducted with the Soviet Union before it has atomic bombs in order to reach a realistic solution. He believes that the Soviet Union may have atomic weapons within one or two years. Churchill pointed out that the Soviet Iron Curtain is gradually expanding, and the danger is increasing day by day. The Division of Germany is Actually Caused by the Soviet Union Regarding Germany, he said that the British government has always believed that the division of Germany will create a country that lacks the will for peace and has a sense of revenge. The Potsdam Conference has agreed to establish a central agency to establish a new Germany based on a new foundation, but the Soviet government has not attempted to find a common policy and opposes the Western allies' abuse of accusations. He finally said: The idea of European unity is beyond reproach. The question is whether European unity can be achieved without one power ruling Europe. If one power attempts to rule Europe directly or indirectly, the result will be another war. I hope we can all abandon this idea. Britain's policy is to allow small countries to have the opportunity to develop without fear of conflict under the protection of the four powers, but we cannot agree in a period when one of the four powers forces small countries to accept political and economic systems.</p>
<p>The Policy of Four-Power Cooperation Must Be Carried Out Step by Step</p>
<p>When we organize the Western European alliance, the policy of four-power cooperation must be carried out step by step, based on the principle of equality and including the element of freedom. The continued existence of the division of Europe is caused by the will of the Soviet Union. This division is actually contrary to the statements of the Soviet Supreme Authorities and Marshal Stalin.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Signs Trade Agreement with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg [United Press Moscow 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>According to news from Belgium, the Soviet Union has signed a trade agreement with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, stipulating the exchange of goods. The agreement is said to be the largest purchase by the Soviet Union from countries outside Eastern Europe since the war. It was concluded after about eight weeks of negotiations in Moscow between Soviet trade officials and representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Will Abandon Neutrality [Reuters Brussels 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Bevin pointed out frankly that the seriousness of the international situation and his proposal to expand the Anglo-French alliance may cause the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to completely overturn the neutral foreign policy jointly adopted by the three countries. Political figures pointed out that the environment that prompted Britain and France to propose expanding the alliance has made it impossible for the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to continue to maintain their neutral policy. Until the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers Conference, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg still opposed Western European blocism and supported the regional agreements stipulated in the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>[Reuters The Hague 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Dutch newspapers commented on Bevin's speech, emphasizing Britain's important position in European politics. The New Mail of Freedom stated that European politics cannot exist without Britain. Europe is under the political fire line of the world. No European country can defend itself alone. The negotiations currently underway are the first step towards European unity. The Catholic newspaper said that the Soviet Union has established a large-scale political and economic alliance in Eastern Europe. The time has now come for Britain to make a decision.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Urges Government to Approve New Anglo-Iraqi Treaty [United Press London 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The Iraqi manager held a meeting with Baghdad officials on a long-distance telephone on the 22nd to try to reverse the refusal of the Iraqi Regent to extend the recent Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Iraqi Prime Minister told the British Foreign Office that he could guarantee that the Iraqi Regent's veto of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was due to a "misunderstanding." He expressed confidence that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty could be approved once he returned to the country. It is generally believed that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty is an important offensive in British diplomacy to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the Middle East. The Iraqi Prime Minister also said that during his absence from the country, some saboteurs used innocent students to create an atmosphere of unrest.</p>
<p>French International Bank to Approve Franc Devaluation [United Press Paris 23rd Dispatch]</p>
<p>According to news from the French Ministry of Finance, despite Britain's opposition, the International Bank is expected to approve the devaluation of the French franc on the 23rd. The French cabinet held an emergency meeting today. According to reliable sources, the cabinet's deliberation is roughly the same as what Finance Minister Meill said yesterday, that is, a financial decision must be made before the weekend. Britain's reason for opposing is that France's formation of a free currency market will have an adverse impact on the gold pound.</p>
<p>Washington is Very Satisfied with Bevin's Proposal to Form the Core of Western Europe [This Newspaper Report]</p>
<p>New York, 23rd Broadcast: Washington News, the U.S. government has officially expressed its heartfelt welcome to British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement yesterday that Western Europe should form a military alliance to deal with the expansion of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>People here have welcomed Bevin's suggestion to diplomatically unite Western Europe to resist the Soviet Union's tendency to dominate. It is considered a powerful supplement to the Marshall Plan. It is also believed that Bevin's speech indicates a new shift in British foreign policy and is entering the same line as the Truman Doctrine. Moreover, Bevin's words are more straightforward and powerful than the remarks of American politicians when the Truman Doctrine was first announced. Republican foreign policy adviser Dulles said that Bevin's proposal is extremely important and can encourage Congress to take action on the Marshall Plan. Vandenberg called it a surprising remark, and specifically pointed out that Bevin's proposal to establish a connection between Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is "the most hopeful voice he has heard from Europe." Hurd, a specialist in foreign relief in the House of Representatives, also expressed his belief that the U.S. aid plan will benefit from the willingness of European countries to cooperate. People here also believe that Bevin's call to establish a core of Western Europe is timely. Recently, U.S. diplomatic authorities Dulles and Baruch have also made similar suggestions, and Baruch's suggestion is even more advanced than Bevin's call, advocating the establishment of a European political, economic, and defense alliance, guaranteed by the United States.</p>
<p>New York Herald Tribune reporter Lippmann opposed the establishment of a Western European Convention, believing that it would promote the division of Western Europe. He pointed out that some countries, such as Norway, Denmark, France, Italy, etc., cannot yet be responsible for defending the other countries of the sixteen European countries, so it is expected that most Western European countries will refuse to participate in the Western European Convention.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>People here believe that Bevin's statement, which was issued twenty-four hours after the State Department released the secret archives on German-Soviet relations, is a joint diplomatic action by Britain and the United States. It is understood that Bevin exchanged views with the U.S. government before his speech. Diplomatic and press circles believe that Bevin's intention is to warn the Soviet Union that Western countries will not allow any power to control Europe until there is a unified effort to maintain the balance.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the afternoon of the 22nd, expressing its full approval of Bevin's announcement in the House of Commons that Britain and France have begun to take action to establish a tacit political alliance.</p>
<p>United States Begins Broadcasting German-Soviet Diplomatic Secrets [Central News Agency New York 23rd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The "Voice of America" radio station here has begun today to use various languages to broadcast brief broadcasts of secret documents under the cooperation between Hitler and Stalin to various parts of the world, thereby launching a counter-offensive propaganda against the Soviet Union. The documents issued by the State Department, together with Britain's plan for a Western European alliance and the British Foreign Minister's accusation of Soviet foreign policy, are the big-character headlines of today's newspapers. Gromyko declined to comment on the publication of the records of Moscow and Berlin's consultations at Success Lake.</p>
<p>[United Press Columbus, Georgia 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall told reporters here today that the State Department originally intended to publish various secret agreements signed by the Soviet Union and the Nazis before the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, but postponed their publication because "we intend to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>France is Willing to Reconcile with Viet Minh so that Viet Minh Can Gain Independence Within the French Union Will Sign a Formal Agreement with Bao Dai</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The return of French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pilaar, will bring France's efforts to rebuild peace in Vietnam to a new stage. Although the meeting between Bo and Bao Dai did not achieve the expected quick results, it has laid a new foundation for a mutually satisfactory solution. The anti-war psychology of the people of Tokyo, Annam, and Cochinchina has been increasing, and Ho Chi Minh's hope is not as good as before. The military situation in North Vietnam has turned favorable to the French side, but in Cochinchina, the rice-producing area in the south, the activities of guerrillas have been increasing. The French side is now prepared to allow the Viet Minh to obtain full independence within the French Union. Regarding allowing Cochinchina to form a Viet Minh Republic with Tokyo Annam, the French government may be prepared to satisfy the Kuomintang. However, the French side will insist that the agreement signed by the Vietnamese side must be permanent. The French side feels that Ho Chi Minh only regards the agreement as a temporary tool, which will be used as a springboard for further demands. Therefore, if France can sign a formal agreement with Bao Dai, there will be no such concerns.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Officials generally agree with France's plan to have Bao Dai return to Vietnam to rule the autonomous territories of Annam Tokyo and Cochinchina.</p>
<p>Western European Freedom is Threatened, the United States Should Not Protect Itself</p>
<p>Marshall Talks About the European Recovery Program [Reuters Atlanta 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall said in a speech to the National Cotton Council here today that in order for the European Recovery Program to achieve its final success, the sixteen European countries must continue the efforts that began at the Paris Conference last summer to achieve European unity. The Marshall Plan is a cooperative plan to save Western civilization. With the cooperation of 415 million people in Europe and the United States, it is believed that Western civilization will continue to exist and develop. The results of these joint efforts will not only determine the immediate course of European events, but will also affect the future of Americans in the east, south, west, and north. The goals of the Marshall Plan are broad and the effects are far-reaching, so no American can take it lightly. If its goals are not achieved, the effects of its failure will affect every part. The agreements signed by the United States with each recipient country will be aimed at combating inflation, restoring confidence in the national currency, and facilitating the free movement of materials, currency, and labor across borders. These conditions will not hinder European rights and will ensure that resources are used to the best common benefit. If European countries waste the aid that the U.S. economy can provide, they themselves will be the main victims. Today, there are powerful forces that are forcing Western Europe to adopt political systems that abandon their freedom. We cannot assume that we can only maintain their security by protecting the principles of individual freedom and representative government. Although our country is strong, we cannot maintain isolation and strength at the same time. We need friends, especially friends who share our views on social organization. The maintainers of free ownership must cooperate closely, because maintaining liberalism requires not only individual efforts, but also collective efforts.</p>
<p>Hoover's Suggestions on the European Aid Plan [U.S. News Agency Washington 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Former President Hoover sent a letter to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today, suggesting that the U.S. commitment to the European Recovery Program should be limited to the first fifteen months, and that all donations should be limited to surplus consumables. The Republican politician said that the need for major materials and equipment in Europe may be subsidized in part by loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the World Bank. Hoover estimates that the United States may export US$3 billion in consumables to the European Recovery Program in the first fifteen months, as well as exports from the occupation of I in Korea, Germany, and Japan. It is said that Hoover's colleagues indicated that Hoover expects the loan to increase by about US$1 billion, totaling US$4 billion. He feels that this amount should be provided in the first year.</p>
<p>Indonesia and the Netherlands Have Conflicting Interpretations of Political Principles, and the Mediation Committee Needs to Resolve Them Again</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Well-informed sources said that the six political principles accepted by Indonesia and the Netherlands need to be resolved by the Security Council's Mediation Committee in Jakarta due to different interpretations by both sides. A statement issued in The Hague yesterday pointed out that the Republic of Indonesia only accepted the six principles based on its one-sided interpretation, and that the Dutch government had requested the Mediation Committee to clarify this matter. Before clarification, some group meetings originally scheduled to be held tomorrow have been announced to be postponed. The first of the six principles stipulates that the Netherlands will maintain its sovereignty in Indonesia before Indonesia's sovereignty is transferred to the United States of Indonesia. However, a spokesman for the Republic of Indonesia stated yesterday that according to the records of the meeting between the Republic of Indonesia and the Mediation Committee in Yogyakarta, the status quo will continue to be maintained until both parties agree otherwise. The Republic also stated that they will continue to direct their national defense, finance, and foreign relations.</p>
<p>The Marshall Plan Can Extinguish Future Wars, the Opinion of the Director of Wartime Intelligence</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>General Donovan, who served as the Director of Intelligence during the war, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Soviet Union is now employing trained spies to wage war against the United States. The Marshall Plan will be used to extinguish the Soviet Union's undeclared war. The danger to the United States is to allow the Soviet Union or other countries to seize bases occupied by U.S. allies, cross U.S. transportation lines, and penetrate the inner defense line with disintegration tactics. By the time the need to go to war is discovered, it will be too late to do anything. If the United States can seize the initiative, it can avoid an actual shooting war. This is the importance of the Marshall Plan, but at the same time, it must not be regarded as an economic Maginot Line. The Marshall Plan must be supplemented by other weapons, and its measures must not be destroyed by the Communist Party or propaganda weapons.</p>
<p>Patterson Opposes Cutting Aid to Europe [U.S. News Agency Washington 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Another group of important private citizens attended the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to express their views on U.S. assistance proposed for the European Recovery Program. The vast majority of their arguments supported the enactment of legislation authorizing the allocation of US$6.8 billion for the first fifteen months of the program, as proposed by President Truman. These private citizens included former Secretary of War Patterson, "Atlantic Charter Magazine" editor McGill, and former wartime Director of the Strategic Services Bureau Donovan. At the same time, the House Foreign Relations Committee continued to hear the opinions of important government spokespersons. Patterson strongly advocated that it would be foolish to cut the proposed amount of U.S. aid. He said, "Those who advocate cutting four or five billion dollars clearly fail to recognize the goal. The reduced plan can prevent a large number of people from starving collectively, but it is not enough to make the recovery a reality."</p>
<p>United Nations Begins to Study the Establishment of International Forces in the Holy Land</p>
<p>[United Press Success Lake 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The United Nations Palestine Committee is convinced that it is necessary to establish international troops in the Holy Land, and on the 22nd ordered a thorough study of all proposals related to the establishment of this force. The United Nations Secretariat will provide the council with historical data on the 23rd. According to general indications, the council will eventually submit a special report requesting military assistance. The Palestine Committee, which is responsible for monitoring the division of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, has begun drafting its first monthly report, which will be submitted to the Security Council. The report will describe Britain's opposition to the recommendations of the UN General Assembly and its refusal to open Palestinian ports to allow unlimited immigration of Jews.</p>
<p>[United Press Beirut 23rd Dispatch]</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, thousands of Arab troops have infiltrated Palestine from Syria and Lebanon. According to unreliable sources, the Arab troops in Palestine attacked the Jews first. When the British troops went to the rescue, the Arab troops outside the border sneaked into Palestine from the border farther away from the war. They are all well-equipped elite troops. The Standing Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission said that the Soviet Union's atomic control proposal, which is now being studied in detail by the Finance Committee, has no prejudice and requested that representatives from other countries also adopt the same attitude. Today, when the committee continued to discuss the Soviet proposal, Wei participated in the actions of several other representatives and raised several special questions to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko regarding his proposal to control the atom.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Asks for $500 Million for Relief to Japan Halsey Calls Japan a Bulwark Against Aggression</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 22nd Dispatch]</p>
<p>The military has requested approximately $500 million in aftercare relief to Japan in the next fiscal year. The procedure has been submitted to the Far East Committee. Among them, the funds proposed by General MacArthur's headquarters for food, clothing, and other educational materials for Japan account for approximately $300 million, and the funds for Japan's industrial reconstruction account for approximately $200 million.</p>
<p>[United Press Philadelphia 23rd Dispatch]</p>
<p>Admiral Halsey, commander of the U.S. Third Fleet during the war, said today in a speech to the alumni association of the Philadelphia Textile College that if the United States wants to revive the economies of Europe and Japan and help guard the world in the future, it must pay a very high price for several years, but this is ultimately better than the Third World War. Not only does Europe need to be revived, but so does Japan. Japan can become a strong fortress between the United States and its future aggressors</p>

<p>Hu Shi Encountered a Strange Person on His Way Home at Night</p>
<p>Claiming to Be Like a Young Lady Looking for a Husband for Security</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Beiping Air Mail] Peking University President Hu Shi, on his way home at 9 o'clock the night before, had just reached his front door when a mentally disordered strange person suddenly chased in. After interrogation, it was found that he was an auditor at Peking University, named Hu Jingming, 27 years old, from Henan, residing at No. 26 Guohui Street. He was carrying a letter, requesting security, and his speech was incoherent. He then collapsed to the ground. This student had applied to be a formal student at Peking University last year, but was not admitted, and later became an auditor at Peking University. Because auditors do not receive diplomas upon graduation, he was depressed all day long, and his mental state gradually deteriorated. At the time, Mr. Hu, fearing an incident, immediately summoned police officers from the First Sub-Bureau to take the student to the police station for questioning. It is reported that this student had repeatedly requested to be changed to a formal student, but had not been approved. The original letter from this student to President Hu is excerpted as follows: "President Hu: I am like an eighteen-year-old young lady, wanting to find a sensible husband to protect me and satisfy my desires. I feel too lonely and insecure, so I am writing this letter to you to ask for security and satisfaction. If you don't like it, please kill me with a kitchen knife, so as not to cause further trouble. Sincerely, your faithful believer, Hu Jingming."</p>
<p>New British Invention: Sound Recording on Paper</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 23rd Dispatch] The earliest method of recording human speech was Edison's recording cylinder, which is still used in shorthand dictaphones. Subsequent sound recordings on gramophone records and sound films were significant advancements each time. The latest development is the ability to record sound on thin paper. The London Electrical and Musical Industries Company has now manufactured such a machine, the size of a portable typewriter, equipped with a playback device. After recording, the sound is played back, clear and loud. In public gatherings, the "recording paper" becomes the speaker. The recording process is extremely simple. After completion, the paper can be removed and mailed to any region.</p>
<p>Encourage Middle School Students to Participate in International Communication</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to promote international communication among students in our country, the Municipal Bureau of Education established the Chinese Student International Communication Committee in June last year, chaired by Zhao Chuanjia, principal of Municipal Xishi Middle School. Twenty-eight public and private middle schools participated, with 119 students. They have communicated with students in the United States, Canada, England, France, Austria, and other countries, sending a total of 274 letters and receiving 296 letters. This year's plan is for responsible persons of member schools to effectively supervise students in engaging in communication, in order to achieve comprehensive promotion. Foreign students will also be asked to introduce good books and newspapers suitable for the middle school level, in order to purchase and exchange them for reading. The implementation methods are: Encourage public and private middle school students in this city to participate as much as possible. Request student names from foreign communication schools and distribute them to member schools. Compile and print a directory of Chinese schools in English and distribute it to foreign schools. The above work is expected to be completed within one year.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Special Silver Shield Competition All Chinese Teams Dominate Western Teams Eliminated Chinese Teams Compete for Championship</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Air Mail] Fifteen teams from Group A participated in this year's Special Shield Elimination Battle. After the first round of elimination, the semi-quarterfinals were held on the 17th (Saturday) and 18th (Sunday), with eight teams competing for the semi-quarterfinal qualification. As a result, on Saturday: the Bus team eliminated the South China Association, 2-1; the Eastern Association forced out the Hong Kong Association, 3-2; and Kitchee beat the Artillery, 2-0. On Sunday, in the single game, the Star Island defeated the Police, 5-1. This means that the Special Silver Shield is now entirely dominated by Chinese teams.</p>
<p>Bus Veterans Fight Hard to Eliminate South China</p>
<p>Of the three games on Saturday, the most intense was the South China vs. Bus game at the Police stadium. Although Bus had many veterans, South China had vitality, and a fierce battle was inevitable. In a fierce battle, South China was brutally eliminated 1-2 despite having the advantage. In the first half, although South China was at a disadvantage against the wind, it was still able to remain unbeaten. In the second half, it was even able to score first, but it lost due to being unable to sustain its strength in the later stages. South China lost unfairly.</p>
<p>Of course, Bus was able to avoid conceding too many goals under South China's prolonged attacks, of course, there was a reason, and that was Tan Jiangbai's outstanding performance. "Copper Head" guarded the center back, no less majestic than in his prime, forcing South China to have many opportunities to attack, but few opportunities to shoot. As for the two goals conceded by South China, left back Lin Rushun cannot shirk his responsibility, as both goals were leaked in from Rushun's side.</p>
<p>The outcome of the game was determined entirely in the second half. Chen Dehui of South China sent the ball in from afar during a mixed attack, opening the scoring first. Later, Bus's right winger Zhong Jingsheng tricked Lin Rushun and scored, 1-1. Finally, Rushun intercepted Jingsheng again, but Jingsheng broke through again, and Xuan Jie greeted the ball and charged in alone, 2-1, Bus eliminated South China.</p>
<p>[Bus Team] Sun Baoan, Li Tiansheng, Mai Linfu, Feng Kunsheng, Tan Jiangbai, Deng Sen, Li Shuoyou, Zhuo Shijin, Deng Xuanjie, Du Wenzhi, Zhong Jingsheng</p>
<p>Coming from Behind, Eastern Defeats Hong Kong Association</p>
<p>At Happy Valley, the Eastern vs. Hong Kong Association game was also a good show, because both teams adopted a hard-hitting style, making the game particularly interesting to watch. In the first half, Eastern conceded a goal first. Li Deqi saw that the forwards were timid and hesitated to advance, so in the second half, he volunteered to take command, and Qian Chifen retreated. With this adjustment, the momentum was indeed different. Deqi first forced a penalty kick, tying the score 1-1. Not long after, Liang Rongguang took advantage of Luo Weiquan's free kick and headed the ball into the net, 2-1, Eastern came back to win. But five minutes later, the Hong Kong Association also scored through Lie Wen, 2-2. In this situation, Eastern saw that it was either win or lose, so it launched an all-out attack. Ye Baotao snatched the final victory in the chaos, winning the quarterfinal qualification 3-2.</p>
<p>[Eastern Association] Tan Jun'gan, Xie Jinhong, Li Deqi, Luo Weiquan, Huo Yaohua, Zeng Xikang, Liang Rongguang, Liu Fuquan, Mai Weilin, Qian Chifen, Ye Baotao</p>
<p>Kitchee Declines, Cleanly Wins 2 Goals Against the Artillery</p>
<p>Kitchee's encounter with the Artillery was originally a sure win, but Kitchee has had many troubles recently, which has affected the team's morale. It seems difficult to find a future. Seeing that it was tied by the Artillery in the first half, it can be seen from their psychology. In the second half, Bingzhao and Huanzhang scored, winning 2-0 against the Artillery.</p>
<p>[Kitchee Association] Zhu Zhaohang, Tan Zhenhui, Zeng Zhongyun, Tan Huanzhang, You Huaxing, Liu Qingcai, Huang Jingcong, Li Dianqi, Li Bingzhao, Lei Shuping, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Reviving its Prestige, Star Island Smashes the Police</p>
<p>On Sunday, there was only one game. Star Island fought the Police at Yuanyuan Qiu. Since reorganizing its lineup, Star Island has regained its past prestige. Based on Star Island's current strength, it is not easy to find an opponent in the football circle. At the start of the war, Star Island's formation was:</p>
<p>[Star Island Association] Yu Yaode, Xu Jingcheng, Hou Rongsheng, Zhang Jinhai, Song Lingsheng, Liu Songsheng, He Yingfen, Li Zhaorong, Zhu Yongqiang, Feng Jingxiang, Xie Jinhe</p>
<p>However, the Police did not shy away from the game due to their inferior strength. In the first half, they tied Star Island tightly. After 22 minutes, Jingxiang猛射 hit someone and bounced into the net to win first, but in less than five minutes, the Police equalized, and the first half ended 1-1.</p>
<p>In the second half, Jingxiang changed to lead the central army, and Yongqiang took over as the right assistant, and the situation was very different. Star Island controlled the overall situation. In this section, it was simply watching Star Island perform. First, Jingxiang's wonderful pass Yingfen挑入了, 2-1, Zhaorong　entered a penalty kick, 3-1. Star Island's offensive did not stop slightly. Before the end of the game, Yingfen迎掃 Jingxiang's header, scoring in one fell swoop, 4-1. Song Ji, Songsheng遠射 scored, adding another goal, and the Police were defeated 5-1.</p>

<p>Green Camp Individual Table Tennis Tournament Adult Group Preliminary Resolved</p>
<p>The Second Individual Table Tennis Championship Tournament organized by the Green Camp Table Tennis Team is divided into adult and youth groups. A total of 45 people participated in the adult group, divided into five groups for elimination. The top two players in each group will participate in the full-numbered rematch, and the championship and runner-up positions will be determined by the few points. The group has been completed, and the first two seats in each of the five groups have been explored, and the list of selected members is as follows: (First Group) Chief Dai Xing, runner-up Tong Renian, (Second Group) Chief Chen Hongjun, runner-up Zhu Weichu, (Third Group) Chief Zhao Zhenyuan, runner-up Zheng Guoxian, (Fourth Group) Chief Ma Huaming, runner-up Lu Zongde, (Fifth Group) Chief Chen Ruide, runner-up Liu Delin.</p>
<p>Tonight Basketball League Qingbai vs. Topeka, Donghua vs. Peel</p>
<p>Starting at 5:30 PM today, there will be three more basketball league games for Group A and the women's group at the gymnasium. The main battle is Qingbai vs. the US Navy's Topeka. In another game, Donghua will play Tal, and in the women's group, Qianghua will play the Li team. Tickets are 20,000 for the upper floor, 40,000 for the lower floor, and 70,000 for the numbered seats in the venue, which will be opened at the same time. The order of the stadium will be maintained by the Siwei Boy Scouts who will be on site.</p>
<p>In the women's group, Qianghua plays against the Li team. Although Qianghua has no hope of winning the women's group, it can still win a seat in the third place. Unfortunately, last week it was poisoned by Qingqiu, and it became a tripod with the front line Qingqiu. Today, when it meets the Li team, it should be able to win. The Li team has lost every game, but its sportsmanship is good and worthy of encouragement.</p>
<p>In the second scene of Group A2, Donghua will play against Peel. Donghua has played a few times, and all its soldiers are famous football players with plenty of stamina and a tough style. The opponent Peel has many basketball players from various universities, and at that time, the strength will be equal, and there will be a fierce battle.</p>
<p>In the finale, Qingbai and Topeka from Group A1 will face off. Qingbai has been fighting on the battlefield for a long time and is an old basketball player. At the beginning of the league, due to lack of contact, it suffered many setbacks. Progress has been seen recently, and it showed its skills in the battle against Dagong before last week, but the only drawback is that it lacks stamina and it is difficult to continue in the later stages. Topeka is the leader of the expatriates. At that time, the victory or defeat of the 交綏与 Qingbai is difficult to predict. The order for tonight is as follows: Qianghua—Li Team (Women's Group) 5:30 PM Donghua—Peel (甲二B) 6:30 PM Qingbai—Topeka (甲一組) 7:30 PM (青白)蔡演雄, 張少卿, 鄒耀雅, 徐亨, 王南珍, 唐寳堃, 周達雲, 陳祥龍, 卓國榮, 汪均炳.

<p>Government Decides to Implement Comprehensive Food Rationing from March 1</p>
<p>Pilot Implementation in Five Major Cities: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Public Educators' Rice Ration Reduced to Three Dou Next Month</p>
<p>The government has decided to implement comprehensive food rationing in five major cities, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, starting from March 1. Flour will be rationed in Beijing and Tianjin, and rice will be rationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Fifty percent of the rationed food will be relief supplies from the United States, and fifty percent will be raised by the government itself. It is reported that this decision will ration food by household, with each person receiving one 市斗 of rice per month. The ration of flour will be equivalent to 6.25 斤 of flour per 市斗 of rice, with half rations for small households. The rationing price will be adjusted once a month, and the Executive Yuan will decide whether it will be based on market prices or lower than market prices so that it can be followed. In this city, based on a population of 5 million, 75% are large households, which should be 3.75 million, and the rest are small households, which are 1.25 million. Large households receive one 市斗 of rice per month, requiring 375,000 石 of rice. Small households receive five 升, requiring 62,500 石, totaling 437,500 石, which is equivalent to 35,000 tons. The government has prepared four months' worth of food and will first ration it for March, April, May, and June. The government will continue to prepare for continuous rationing for July, August, and September to provide assistance during the lean season. In the past, public educators received eight 斗 per month, and workers and students received two 斗 each. It is generally believed that this was not universal and was unreasonable. After the implementation of comprehensive rationing, it will be abolished to show fairness. However, although public educators will receive new salaries based on the cost of living index, the government has decided to seek a solution to subsidize the purchase of rationed rice within limits. At the State Council meeting on the 23rd, it was decided that the amount of rice rationed to public educators will be reduced to three 斗 per person per month (originally eight 斗) starting from February of this year. The detailed measures will be formulated by the Executive Yuan. According to the person in charge of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, difficulties in this rationing are expected: First, the district 保甲 receive meager compensation, and the manpower is weak, resulting in unclear household registration. Second, the rice shops, cooperatives, and social service centers that are responsible for rationing inevitably have cases of mixing and deducting due to insufficient expenses. Third, the rice price is adjusted once a month, and the interest rate is very high at present. Who is willing to buy first and lose money? If everyone buys at the end of the month, there will be queues and congestion. Efforts are being made to solve this problem to ensure that the district 保甲 can fulfill their responsibilities. The rice shops should also be given a considerable discount to make up for their expenses. In short, the difficulties that may arise in the future will be minimized as much as possible.</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Rises Sharply, 19 Chinese Stocks Halted</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw the return of hot money, and financial gangs came to absorb them. The short sellers urgently replenished their positions. In the middle of the day, the actual goods from the Guangdong gang were still flowing out, but they were offset by the rising market sentiment. With a rebound, 19 stocks rose to their limit.</p>
<p>The market opened weakly. After Yongsheng Yarn entered the market from 697 yuan and 735 yuan, it rose to 710 yuan and 740 yuan, and then slightly fell to 698 yuan and 728 yuan due to more selling. As credit conditions eased, it became weaker again. The off-market interest rate opened low at 2 角8.5 分 and 3 角3, rising to 715 yuan and 747 yuan. After a slight fall, the buying sentiment was strong. Zhongfa Underwear, Zhongsi, Yonggong, Xinhua, Quanhsing, Tongyi Enamel, Jingfu, and Xinyi were successively halted. Yongsheng Yarn even rose to a high price of 728 yuan and 765 yuan. Many people took the opportunity to sell, and it fell by 10 yuan near noon, closing at 722 yuan and 759 yuan.

Yongsheng Yarn also rose to a high price of 756 yuan and 786 yuan. Guoxing差进 more than 50 billion, retreating to 736 yuan and 762 yuan.

<p>Unified Price Flat, Foreign Stocks Rise</p>
<p>Public debt failed to hold up again yesterday. Tongbing opened at 68,000 in the morning and rose from 67,000 to close at 71,000. The turnover was about 4 million. Compared with the previous closing, Jia, Yi, and Bing fell by 2,000 yuan each, and Ding and Wu fell by 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Government Agrees to Consider Partially Opening Industrial Loans</p>
<p>With the Lunar New Year approaching, factories in various places have successively requested the government to partially open industrial loans for assistance. Wu Yun'chu, chairman of the National Industrial Association, took the relevant information to Nanjing on the 11th to report the actual difficulties of the current industrial sector and provide opinions to President Zhang and the responsible leaders of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At that time, President Zhang attached great importance to the various sections reported by Wu and expressed that its principles could be accepted. He also believed that the government should not sit idly by if production businesses really need assistance. President Zhang also allowed the information brought by Wu to be submitted to the Four Joint Offices to quickly formulate measures, and after the research, they will be submitted to the Chairman for approval. It is now known that Wu returned to Shanghai on the 23rd. It is said that the opening date is hoped to be as early as possible, but the key lies in the timing of the measures formulated by the Four Joint Offices. In terms of the amount, the government should have comprehensive planning. Thinking from the perspective of the industrial sector, loans are a last resort. How much is borrowed must take into account how much will be repaid in the future. Although the government has not clearly stipulated the method, it is said that it intends to adopt order loans. However, this method is not fully suitable for the industrial sector'</p>
<h3>Wuxi Suzhou: Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 23rd] Due to continuous rain in Wuxi, the supply of grain to the city has been scarce. Influenced by the soaring prices of flour and wheat, public sentiment has been stimulated, leading to large-scale purchases by Shanghai merchants. Holders of goods are unwilling to sell at lower prices, pushing the market upwards, exceeding the limited price. Top-quality white rice is now selling for 1.3 million (currency unit). The market opened at 1,287,000, closed at 1,297,000. Baiyangjian reached 1,307,000, Bujian 1,270,000, Baiyuan 1,407,000, a sharp increase of 60-70,000. Early season rice is at 575,000, Yangxian rice at 561,000, Buxian rice at 541,000, and Yuan rice at 601,000, rising rapidly by 30-40,000.

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The Suzhou rice market situation has been slowly declining in recent days, dropping by 80-90,000 from its peak. Merchants were eager to sell, seeking to get rid of their stocks early. The public initially felt reassured about the future of food supply. However, today, prices suddenly rebounded. Sample parcels in the market are scarce, and trading is quiet. Prices have risen universally by 20,000. Top grade white rice is trading at 1.27 million per dan (unit of weight), coarse early season rice at 1.11 million. It is rumored that the reason for the renewed price surge is due to the easing of credit conditions.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Over Twenty Businesses Liquidate</h3>

<h3>Yuehan Railway Passenger Train: Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] The Yuehan Railway passenger train was robbed by bandits on the morning of the 23rd. The incident occurred when the driver was heading towards Nantou, Zhuchao city, at 0:40. He suddenly saw a red light ahead, so he slowed down to investigate. At that point, three bandits jumped onto the locomotive and tricked the driver and stoker into getting off. The remaining bandits, about 50-60 in number, swarmed onto the passenger cars to rob the passengers. Taking advantage of their unpreparedness, the driver jumped back onto the locomotive, started it, and sped away. The bandits on the train jumped off one after another, and exchanged gunfire with the military police escorting the train. When the military arrived at Yinzhan station, they found a total of five people dead, two of whom appeared to be passengers, while the other three were suspected of being bandits. The train continued to Guangzhou at around 8:00 on the morning of the 23rd. The Telegraph Headquarters dispatched a team to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Far East Regional Committee: Scheduled to Hold Informal Meeting, Termination Issue Expected to be Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The UNRRA Far East Regional Committee previously held its 37th meeting to discuss termination matters. Due to differing opinions among the committee members regarding the authority of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, the termination could not be completed as scheduled. It is now learned that the inability to reach a consensus was due to a letter from the Chinese government to the committee, stating that after the termination of UNRRA, the assets left by UNRRA, as well as the funds obtained from the sale of assets, should be transferred to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee for management. Long-term relief and rehabilitation efforts should also be managed by that committee, and be promoted after approval. The Custodian Committee is a subordinate organization of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, and its authority should not exceed that of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee. However, according to the opinions of several foreign members, the Custodian Committee is composed of representatives from China and five foreign countries, while the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee is composed solely of the Chinese government. Since UNRRA's assets and funds were jointly provided by the United Nations, they should be managed by the Custodian Committee, which should also be responsible for its rehabilitation efforts. This case was not resolved at the time. The UNRRA Resident Representative in China, Mr. Cleveland, discussed the matter directly with the Chairman of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Committee, Mr. Wang Yunwu. It is now learned that the two sides' views are quite close and a solution is expected to be reached. The committee is scheduled to hold an informal meeting on the 27th of this month, at which time it can be prepared to announce its termination.</p>
<h3>Reynolds Hosts Journalists: Reports on Exploration Objectives, We Decide to Cooperate and Send Personnel to Participate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The American ballpoint pen tycoon, Mr. Reynolds, and the Director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Mr. Washburn, who plan to explore Mount Jishi, hosted a reception for journalists at the Academia Sinica at 6:00 PM on the 23rd. Mr. Washburn reported on the objectives of the exploration: (1) To use theodolite to accurately measure the altitude of Mount Jishi (Mount Anymachen). (2) To study the formation and extent of glaciers on the mountain. (3) To study issues related to crustal formation. (4) To explore the source of the Yellow River. (5) To take photographs and provide detailed maps needed by Chinese geographers and topographers to study the area. At the beginning of the reception, Mr. Sa Bendong, the Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica, introduced Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Washburn, and expressed his gratitude and welcome to them for their enthusiasm for science and their journey to China. He hoped that the first joint Sino-American exploration would be successful, strengthening cultural ties between the two countries. Mr. Reynolds's budget is US$175,000. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 24th, travel to the US via Hong Kong, gather the team he has hired, and bring specially equipped aircraft and necessary equipment to Nanjing. Then, he will set up a base in Chengdu and begin work, hoping to gain a better understanding of unknown areas and make contributions. Mr. Sa Bendong also stated that the Chinese government is very pleased to support Mr. Reynolds's efforts, and has formed a Sino-American Mount Jishi Exploration Committee, with representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Education, and Transportation, as well as the Academia Sinica, the Central Geological Survey, the Central Meteorological Bureau, the Ministry of National Defense, its Survey Bureau, and the Air Force Headquarters. Mr. Sa will be responsible for the overall coordination and will negotiate a contract with Mr. Washburn. In addition to sending scientists, China will also have military liaison officers accompanying the team to ensure national defense secrets are protected.

<h3>More Than Thirty Overseas Chinese Groups in Burma: Publicly Criticize the AFPFL</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Rangoon, 23rd] Ten overseas Chinese community groups issued a statement today, publicly criticizing the Chinese Democratic League recently established here, and demanding that all overseas Chinese not participate in the League. The statement said: "Overseas Chinese here are limited to engaging in business. Participating in illegal organizations is definitely not our purpose. Many unscrupulous elements have sneaked into Burma, and have used the names of overseas Chinese organizations to carry out rebellious activities. The Democratic League here is organized by these types of elements. Its existence is a burden to the interests of our motherland, and a detriment to the friendship between China and Burma. Therefore, we specifically declare that we will never support the Democratic League, which has been liberated in our motherland." It is reported that the local authorities are paying special attention to the members of the Democratic League here. Criminal Investigation Department officials, accompanied by several police officers, visited the residences of Democratic League spokesman ..., party members Chen Cheng and Xu Simin yesterday, and searched the League's office on Mengjin Street. As a result of the search, a large photograph of... was found in the office.</p>
