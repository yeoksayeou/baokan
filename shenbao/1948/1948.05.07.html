<h3>賴普漢下月初來華　負責執行美援計劃　我政府表示願全力合作</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕經濟合作署本日宣布：委任前舊金山市長兼輪船公司總裁賴普漢爲對華經濟合作團團長。經濟合作執行人霍夫受於發表此一布吿時稱，渠對於賴普漢接受此職，甚感欣慰。在美國援外法案之下，中國分得經濟援助三億三千八百萬美元，由經濟合作署執行。另有一億二千五百萬美元，規定贈與中國，一如杜魯門總統所決定者。經濟合作要職員本日稱，後者一款將不在經濟合作署管理範圍之內。賴普漢對經濟合作署中國部份之詳細情形，拒不表示意見，惟謂「吾人所作之任何事情，凡能發展中國之生產以及有助於置中國於穩定基礎之上者，即係向準確之方向之一大步驟」。渠透露渠即將赴歐洲一行，惟願將其建議中之三個月休假縮短，俾於五月二十四日返抵華盛頓，以接受關於其新職務之訓令。渠稱，渠預期於十日左右之後（即六月初）離舊金山赴中國。頓普漢於一八八三年十二月六日生於紐約市，曾在哈佛大學攻讀而於一九〇五年獲得學士學位。同年，渠開始在美國夏威夷輪船公司任書記職，一九二五年升任該公司總經理。自一九三八年至一九四三年，渠係該公司董事會之主席。一九四四年渠當選爲舊金山市長。當第一次世界大戰中，渠曾任步兵上尉。渠又曾於一九四一年担任全國國防調處委員會委員，於一九四二年至四三年担任全國戳時勞工委員會委員。渠亦係美國商會之前任會長。賴普漢曾於去年六月隨一羣美國報紙發行人及編輯訪問中國。（圖爲賴普漢）</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：賴普漢今在紐約，據稱，渠尙未有時間從事擬就計劃，下週三將偕其夫人赴倫敦略事勾留後，即開始工作。渠拒絕進一步發表意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕據悉：賴普漢約於六月一日可抵達中國。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據美國新聞處訊：在新任美援華計劃執行人賴普漢未來華之前，此項工作將由吉爾柏代理主持。按吉氏現任美中華救濟團團長，其任務將於六月三十日終止。此次渠主持以美國救濟糧食分配與我國五大都市，博得各方好評。吉氏友好均希望下月初賴普漢氏來華後，渠仍能繼續輔助之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京八日電〕行政院新聞局長董顯光今日向聯合社記者宣稱，美國政府任命富有管理經驗如賴普漢氏者主持執行援華事宜，中國政府甚爲歡迎，並願全力與之合作，俾能完成其任務。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕經濟調整專署參議摩爾今日宣稱：本署在新任援華代表團長賴普漢赴歐期間，將先派調查國赴華，研究我國當前急需並策劃約六千萬元有關電力，鐵路及開鑛等工業復興經費之運用事宜。國會批准之援華經費除屬於軍事方面之一億二千五百萬元外，悉歸賴氏負責監督，包括裝運糧食，油類，棉花及其他工業原料在內。其中三千八百八十萬元將作改良農業之用，約占總額百分之十。杜魯門總統將會同蔣主席設立農村復興聯合委員會，指導農村發展計劃，由美國委員三人與中國委員二人組織之。賴氏辦事處擬設上海或南京，在分析調查團報吿後提出援華經費之運用方法。同時，據賴氏宣稱，本人此次就任新職，深感愉快。援華經費雖較援歐者爲少，但爲對正當方向進行之一步驟。</p>
<p>主席接見蒲立特談話情形（勵志社攝）</p>
<h3>蒲立特在京　與中美人士洽談</h3>
<p>四日後將赴華北華南</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕蒲立特五日抵京後，兩日來已展開其訪談活動。六日晨，曾與外次葉公超，外部禮賓司長沈昌煥會晤，午應司徒大使邀宴。據渠向友人表示，渠在華期內將儘可能與政府官員及名流學者藉私人友誼之聯繫，以坦白誠懇態度研討中國現狀。</p>

<h3>我對日政策　保持堅定立塲</h3>
<p>不主張報復亦不姑息</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕外交部息：我政府對日政策王外長於四月十四日向國民大會報告外交政策時，已加申述，即我方對日政策自戰爭結束迄今，從未變更。我不主張報復，亦不主張姑息。軍事方面，我主嚴厲。未來對日和約，必須保障日本不能再事侵略。經濟方面，我不反對使日本人民自給自足。至報載關於對日和約各方建議，外交部尙未收到。</p>
<h3>立法院明晨集會　報到立委今可足法定額　國府增派民青兩黨籌委</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕行憲後立法院委員報到者，迄六日下午六時，已達二二七人，狄膺，柳克述，吳尙鷹，張靜愚，愛美娜，鄧飛黃，安輔廷，王宜聲，袁際烱，施今墨，趙珮，倪文亞等，均於上下午分別報到。又行憲後第一屆立法院集會籌備處六日晨十時及晚九時曾兩度舉行談話會，商討各項有關集會事宜，晨間所決定派吳鐵城，樓桐孫負責向政府機關洽請迅速撥款，俾加緊籌備，以便招待立委膳宿交通諸事，經吳·樓兩氏於午後奔走後，晚間會上提出報吿，業已獲得圓滿結果，全部概稱籌備費五百億，可於七日最具領應用。據樓桐孫稱：報到委員旣足集會開議人數，籌備費用亦復經政府及時撥下，八日如期開會，於法律方面，技術方面益無問題，籌備處並已決定八日假報端公吿三事：其一爲截七日晚六時報到立委人數依法已足集會人數。其二爲依憲法實施準備程序，首屆立院應於首屆國大閉幕後第七日（即八日）集會。其三爲集會地點，業經籌備處洽定國民大會堂，故八日晨首屆立法委員即可前往出席，自行集會。樓氏稱：立院集會後，將先開預備會議，其議程大約爲：（一）選舉臨時主席，（二）討論正副院長選舉辦法，（三）決定議事規則（草案將由若千委員自行擬定提出），（四）成立委員資格審委會預備會議，會期由該院自行確定，然應儘快於廿日前進行完畢，蓋依總統，副總統選罷法第七條，首屆總統，副總統應於當選後廿日內就職，自一日國大致送當選證書日起，計至廿日適爲截止期；立院允宜於是日前完成頸備會議各項議程，俾總統，副總統可早日就職，及時提出行政院長人選於立法院進行政府之改組。又國府頃令增派民社黨王世憲，湯汝梅，靑年黨劉東巖，夏濤聲等四人爲行憲第一屆立法院集會籌備處委員。</p>
<h3>民青兩黨聯合聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民·靑兩黨之立委名額問題，目前已演成僵局。靑年黨代表李璜，左舜生·陳啓天三人，昨日午後四時訪張君勱於民社黨總部，會商兩小時餘，決定發表聯合宣言一篇，答覆董局長昨日之聲明，指出此次國民黨以「法律論」來歪曲事實，實屬自食諾言。兩黨黨員將不出席，八日舉行之立法院會議。張君勱會後吿記者，因政府之宣布名額，致此事演成僵局，繫鈴解鈴，權在政府，而不在民·靑兩黨。我人反對以增加立委名額之辦法解決此問題，我人無意使立法院會議成爲一羣衆大會。記者詢以開雷震來滬約渠赴京事，張氏堅決稱：目前無意晋京。</p>
<p>左舜生表示：「雷震氏奉命來滬後，與兩黨經常保持接觸，並隨時以長途電話與首都有關方面保持聯繫，渠曾提出解決問題之意見，但未提及確切之名額」。</p>
<p>民靑兩黨聯合聲明全文如下：</p>
<p>近日國民黨當局迭次聲明，此次立委問題之解決，係依選舉結果，以得票多者當選，故對於民。靑兩黨多數未能當選之立委，實愛莫能助，此種立論，實完全抹煞事實，蓋此次立委選舉，係由政府配票，選票根本未到選民之手，故所謂票多票少，只是政府配票之結果，而非選民選舉之結果。且在選舉之前，國民黨當局早將立委正式候選人與候補候選人分別規定，說明本論票多票少，正式終爲正式，候補終爲候補。現則一反前言，以「法律論」來歪曲事實，實屬自食諾言，自毀信譽。</p>
<p>至謂選舉事務所有靑。民兩黨人士參加，故辦理選舉不致偏頗，此點尤非事實。因各級選舉事務所所辦理者，只爲事務，而一切決定之權，在國民黨與政府。舉例言之，選舉事務所必須得國民黨當局之通知，始能發給當選證書。觀於立委名單之公布，幷非選舉事務所開會決定，而係由國民黨中央幹部開會所決定，即此可槪其餘。</p>
<p>總之，吾人所爭取者，在乎民主政洽規模之建立，其建立在於人民之眞正投票，與夫眞正之多少數，有此投票有此多少數，以兩個以上政黨構成其立法機關，庶幾正反兩方之政見切磋適當。此次立委選舉中之選票，未到人民手中，爲盡人共知共見，乃國民黨當局以不合理，不合法所造成之事實，排斥靑·民兩黨，則靑·民兩黨對於此種一黨包辦之立法院，自將無法參加，惟有以公民資格，本其在野之身，貢獻於國家而已。</p>
<h3>救濟特捐滬區總額　督導會通過增為八萬五千億元　進出口商三百卅三人列為對象</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕救濟特捐滬區配額原定爲五萬五千億元，頃督導委員會六日會中已決定再增三萬億元，總額爲八萬五千億元。按督導會六日例會中，督導委員盧前曾對捐募事遲遲不能推進發言，認爲該會實有雷聲大雨點小之嫌，且開會迄今，分文未曾募得，徒加無益，且即使將來如預期目標募足，但幣値業已不同。旋經主席王雲五將此項意見提衆討論，末決定各區捐款配額均予增加，俾切實用。其次，對滬進出口商人以官價結匯獲利甚據事提出討論，決定此輩商人已結匯滿夫金一萬元，即爲救濟特捐之對象，聞根據統計，滬上此項商人名單達三三三人，督導會決加强進行。會中並已推定劉不同、江庸携此項名單赴滬，有以處理。</p>
<h3>馮聖法由瀋飛京</h3>
<p>傳將出任政府要職</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕交通部第二交警總局長馮聖法，六日由瀋飛平轉京、傳馬氏將出任行憲政府某要職。</p>
<h3>五千餘噸巡洋艦一艘　英宣布移交我國　驅逐艦「孟狄浦」號同時移交</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕海軍部宣布：巡洋艦「震旦」號及驅逐艦「孟狄浦」號，將於五月十九日在樸資茅斯移交中國海軍。接受之中國艦員，在英受訓已有數月之久，「震且」號排水量五二七〇噸，曾於一九四三年六月載英王赴馬爾太，地中海海戰中常見其踪跡。「孟狄浦」號排水量一千噸，曾活躍義大利海岸。按「震且」號係一九三七年下水，備有六吋大砲六門，四吋高射砲八門，廿一吋三裝魚雷發射管兩個，全艦載官兵四五〇人，我國接收後，該艦更名「重慶」號，哲兆祥上尉將任該艦艦長。</p>

<h3>顧毓瑔在全經會報告　外匯開庭係謠傳　銀幣銀類兌換辦法修改　春季絲繭收購價格已擬定公式</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全經會六日下午舉行第三十九次會議，王雲五主席，顧副秘書長毓瑔首先報告物價，謂近六週來物價尙稱平穩，惟最近數日來黃金·美鈔突起漲風，上漲頗劇，此係由於謠言外匯即將開放而起，實則並無其事。繼討論下列要議案</p>

<p>乙·財政部呈請頒佈禁止銀幣銀類流通辦法案，經討論結果，認為禁止銀幣流通事實上困難，未予照准，銀幣銀類仍准流通，惟財政部過去所訂之銀幣銀類兌換法幣辦法，應予修改，其兌換率由中央銀行參照世界銀價及外匯平準基金委員會所定外匯市價，折合計算公布之。</p>
<p>丙·第五，六兩季轍限額中，藥材合計爲四十萬美元，決定予以增加，每季均爲四十萬美元，兩季合爲八十萬美元，至增加之四十萬美元由何處勻支，決定交輸管會研究。</p>
<p>丁·春季絲繭收購價格，已擬訂一計算公式，照廿六年鮮蠶每擔四十四元七角七分之價格計算，本年四月底鮮蠶收購之價格如下：京滬區每一市擔一千八百萬元，杭州區每市擔一千七百萬元，渝每市擔一千一百萬元，穗每市擔一千八百萬元，若物價總指數升高百分之廿時，再由四聯總處按物價指數調整。</p>

<h3>正視朝鮮的危局</h3>
<p>南北朝鮮約各政黨既在平壤舉行聯席會議，一致表示反對南韓單獨選舉，並要求美蘇兩國軍隊同時自朝鮮撤退；而北韓人民會議又在漢城通過了一部「朝鮮民主人民共各國憲法」，於是一直陷於僵局的朝鮮問題似已至攤牌的階段了。據美國駐軍司令霍奇中將的表示，美國決不承認這部憲法，且不願與北韓進仃談判；同時對於平壞會議要求美軍自朝鮮撤退事，也表示斷然拒絕。其所持的理由是：「美軍如若撤退，北韓共產黨軍隊及其渴求權力之黨徒與傀儡，勢必進行控制南韓，如此，朝鮮也就成爲蘇聯衛星國之一了。」美國的態度既然如此明朗和堅定，要使美國讓步，自然是不可能的，預料五月十日南韓單獨舉行選舉，勢在必行，絕無轉圓的餘地了。</p>
<p>朝鮮因美蘇兩國軍隊分駐南北之故，北韓三十八度的分界綫，幾乎成了北韓與南韓的國界；兩年半以來，南北朝鮮的對立和衝突，不獨沒有緩和的希望，反而愈演愈烈，日見尖銳化，使一般人都憂慮着，朝鮮將變爲「東方的希臘」，可能成為第三次大戰的導火綫；因此不特朝鮮人民渴望祖國的統一，獨立，解放；就是在美國，也希望與蘇聯妥協，使這個朝鮮問題能覓獲合理的解決；但是一二年來，朝鮮問題的僵局，始終無法打開；使美國不得不主張南韓單獨選舉，聯合國朝鮮委員會乃決定於五月十日投票。這種辦法在美國言，固可視為沒有辦法的辦法；但在在朝鮮人民的眼中看來，南韓若舉行單獨選舉，其後果勢必成立一個分裂的南韓政府，而南北復歸於統一的願望，也就無法實現了。所以凡是朝鮮的政黨和社會團體，除了李承晚的民主黨而外，無不反對美國在南韓單獨選舉的辦法。甚至朝鮮右派的領袖金九先生也慷慨陳辭：「平壤會議如果失敗，余將在北緯三十八度美蘇兩國佔領區的分界處，切腹自殺』·此在蘇聯方面，對於朝鮮人民渴望統一的心理，認爲大可利用，以此破壞美國在南韓單獨選舉的計劃。故對於平壤會議和北韓人民會議，無不盡其較動的能事。因此平壞會議的決議和北韓人民會議的通過憲法，在表面上看來，固可目爲朝鮮人民的勝利；但是按之實際，所謂朝鮮問題，也不過是美蘇鬥爭的一環而已，對於朝鮮人民本身的命運，仍是毫無利益可言的。</p>
<p>朝鮮局勢發展到此地步，不能不說美國對韓政策的失敗，由其錯誤造成今日的惡果。我們站在第三者的立塲，平心靜氣研究朝鮮問題，不難發現美國對韓政策的辦誤。</p>
<p>第一，朝鮮人民在日本帝國主義壓迫之下，早已覺醒，不特要求民族的獨立與解放，而且要求國家的統一與繁榮；在第二次大戰期問，朝鮮的愛國人士就在國內外，從布民族解放運動；列强在開羅會議及波茨坦會議之中，也無不允許朝鮮在「相當時期」獨立。及至日本屈膝投降，朝鮮人民莫不額手慶祝解放獨立的日子到來，但不料莫斯科三國外長會議的結果，不時朝鮮獨立的願望不能實現，而且朝鮮仍由美蘇兩國軍隊佔領，以北緯三十八度爲分界綫，欲求南北的統一也不可得。怎敎朝鮮人民不失望？不傷心？所以美國不了解朝鮮人民的願望，不履行過去准許朝鮮獨的諾言，扶助朝鮮人民獲得獨立與統一，反而棌取使朝鮮分裂的政策；實爲美國對韓政策的一大錯誤。</p>
<p>第二，朝鮮的南北分裂，在經濟上也是朝鮮的致命傷，因為南韓是朝鮮的農業區，北韓是朝鮮的工業區，只有南北統一，互相配合，互通有無，始能使朝鮮的經濟復興興，反之，朝鮮人民的生活，就無法解決；所以朝鮮人民渴望南北統一，除了政治的因素而外，還有經濟的因素。但是美國的對韓政策，既不尊重朝鮮人民的願望，又不顧及朝鮮的經濟條件，怎能獲得朝鮮人民的擁戴！蘇聯在北韓所採取的行動，我們雖不明其梗概，但是蘇聯總是鼓勵朝鮮人民爭取統一和團結的，總是設法改善朝鮮人民的經濟生活的；兩者相較，美國在朝鮮自然只有失敗了。</p>
<p>第三，美國現所採取的扶助日本復興政策，也是美軍統治南韓喪失民心的一大原因。日本境內的韓僑至今猶受日本政府的虐待與壓迫，在朝鮮人民看來，總是美國扶日抑韓的結果，同時再眼見得日本復興的蒸蒸日上，更使朝鮮人民有重受日本統治的疑懼。何况在南韓境內，所有維持秩序的警察，大半都是日本時代的警察，敵對的心理，依然存在，於是造成朝鮮人民反日反美的心理。所以南韓境內不斷發生暴動，其原因也就在此。</p>
<p>以上所述，是値得美國當局深切反省的。美國對韓政策的改纮易轍，現在正是時候了。美國若不從收拾朝鮮的民心着手，一意孤行到底，五月十日甫韓單獨選舉，可能引起意外的波浪，導成東方火藥庫的爆發！我們希望美國朝野能正視朝鮮的危局。</p>

<p>公用事業本月價　上漲不得過二成　市長邀參會兩委會委員商討　多仍主張恢復間接貼補政策　　〔本報訊〕本市五月份公用事業價格問題，昨由吳市長會開參議會商討決定，如中央不接受市參議會之要求恢復貼補，則本月份上漲成鐵最高不得超過百分之二十。據悉：其中水電煤氣電話四項，最早可能自明日起實行漲價。　吳市長昨邀集參會公用委員會及公用事業調查委員會各委員，商討公用事業價格問題，出席潘議長，公用局趙局長及兩委員會委員四十餘人。燃管會主委張希爲亦參加。市長說明政府無權，使公司必須賠本。現公用事業利潤已祗年息八厘。至言補貼政策，去年實行三個月，其後果爲政府增發通貨。如强制凍結，市長拒絕繳納，其後果爲公司斷絕供給水電，關門或請政府接收，此時將不堪設想。現市府之解決辦法，祗能就造成公用事業價格高漲之因素，努力使之减低。公用事業所需原料外匯經迭次與國行接洽結果，預先結匯一月已不成問題，但目前外匯已較三月底漲百分之二十七。燃煤問題，本市公用事業月需四萬五千九百噸，燃管會五月份配價較前漲百分之四十五，每噸須九百四十六萬四千元，現經與燃管會再三洽商結果，其中一萬五千九百噸可照每噸七百三十二萬一千元價配售，尙有一萬五千噸依每噸九百二十萬配售，其餘一萬五千噸則照五月份新價配售。故燃煤已有一半價格可與上月相仿。其他工人生活指數上漲百分之二十點七，職員指數漲百分之二十七。如依此計算，五月份公用事業價格所漲當在百分之五十左右。現經努力結果，可减至百分之二十五，市府對此已盡最大努力，此外是否尙有其他途徑再可使之减低，希多多指示，市府當盡力做去。　　公用局趙局長繼報吿各公用事業公司所需材料與有關方面接洽情形，並稱各公司開支能緊縮者已盡力使之緊縮，一面並提高效率。　　各參議員熱烈發言，多主張恢復貼補政策，其間並有指資燃管會配煤，非爲整個民生問題着想，而以營利爲目的者。唐承宗及陸蔭初認爲若非漲不可，則至少應就吳市長所提之百分之二十五减半，即增加百分之十二點五。　　議長建議兩點　旋潘議長起立發言，表示如硬性規定公用事業價格不許漲，可能有種種不希望之事發生。並申述二點：（一）要求燃管會煤價不漲，公用事業配煤價格至少三個月不漲，寧可別種用煤配價多漲一點。否則漠視民意，中央應負刺激物價上漲之責任。此外並請中央對公用事業外匯預結三個月，寧可請別的外匯少結一點。如中央能採納，則因公用事業漲價而刺激其他物價上漲之因素一定可减免。（二）公用事業自動調整方式有欠缺之處，希望參議會公用事業調查委員會能趕緊進行調查工作。潘議長並指責外傳有數公用事業公司有大批存敎以低利存於一二商業銀行，銀行以此款購買黑市外匯，此種情形，公司與銀行皆應負責任，希當局能予詳細調查。　　吳市長最後歸納各參議員意見，五月份公用事業價格上漲成數以四月份工人生活指數上漲百分之二十點七爲標準，最高不超過百分之二十，待由市府與各公司接洽。會議至七時許始散。陳納德夫婦返滬　今招待記者報告　　〔本報訊〕民航空運大隊總經理飛虎將軍陳納德，兩月前偕夫人陳香梅赴美出席美衆院外交委員會，業於昨午十一時五十分乘西北航空公司機返抵滬。該公司副總經理魏勞爾，業務處主任陳廣沅等均往龍華機塲歡迎。陳納德將於今晨十時，假外灘十七號七樓空遝大隊舉行記者招待會，對此次被邀返美提供援華意見事，作簡短之報吿。又據陳夫人談在美觀察美國人對華印象稱，美人對於中國情形頗爲隔膜，一般人因受馬歇爾影響，均認爲援歐第一。但對於阻遏共產黨勢力發展一點，美國多數人民亦均竭力一贊成並力促達成。總統新汽車運到　　前軍務局向美訂購之一九四八年皇家流綫型橋車二輛，業於日前運抵滬，十日運京，呈獻作爲總統及副總統專車。該車車身黑色，堅固耐用，式樣新型富麗，且裝有避彈設備云。女富商派人赴錫　要求勿收買臟物　　〔本報無錫六日電〕滬女富商陳斌娟今日派人來錫，向各珠寳店要求勿收受渠所被刦之大批鑽寳，如有發現，並請將人扣留。美齡號英籍船長　地檢處提起公訴　　〔本報訊〕美齡號船長英人李培那瑪，前因撞沉舢舨溺斃一婦人被訊究，昨經地檢處依業務上過失致人於死罪，提起公訴。救濟難民糧食經費　本市得四百五十億　社會局着手搜集三門灣農墾材料　　〔本報訊〕日前晋京向中樞面商本市難民救濟事宜之社會局袁文彰處長，昨由京返滬，據談：在京各省社會行政長官會報中，已決定難民救濟款項之分配，計安徽省假定應受救濟之難民爲七萬五千人，糧食費一千二百九十六億元，糧食遝費一百廿六億元。江蘇省爲十萬人，糧食費二千一百六十億元，運費二百十六億元。本市爲二萬五千人，糧食費四百五十億元，運費五十四億元。各該款項均由美國救濟物資中撥付。至於三門灣難民農墾計劃，社會部甚望由地方人士及慈善敎養團體會同農業有關機關發起主辦，政府必盡力協助。市社會局現已着手收集各項有關三門灣農墾材料，並擬先行派員前往實地視察。左起：陳納德夫婦，右第一人陳廣沅。（本報攝）黑市金鈔破獲三起　　市警察局經濟科經濟大隊，昨破獲黑市金鈔案三起：（一）北京路四川路口祥茂烟店，店主劉仲廉被帶局。（二）天津路江西路吉樂號，負責人劑盛銘帶局。（三）北京東路淸遠里七十二號王世寗，有經營黑市金鈔疑嫌，亦警局偵訊。配給煤球價格　每担十二萬元　改配煤塊與否候再商　　〔本報訊〕本期產業，職業工人配給煤球價格，昨已決定，每拒爲十二萬元，較上期漲一倍。民食調配會主張改配煤塊五十斤（因煤球中百分之五十爲煤渣，故五十斤煤塊即相等於煤球一百斤），以减省每担約需三萬元之煤球加工費，惟因家庭使用習慣上，煤塊無煤球之合用，故社會局將於本週末與民調會再度會商決定，下星期當可公佈。中日空機試航　今晨飛東京　五小時可達　　〔本報訊〕中航公司籌備數月之中日航綫，定今日首次試航。該公司特派XTTO3號空中霸王機頸定今午十一時由龍華機塲啓飛。搭該機赴日人員除該公司總經理劉敬宜，美籍副董事長羅斯福，董事王家驤，高大經，監察陳其均及駐東京業務代表曾長坤等外，尙有政府官員民航局業務處長蕭立坤，駐日代表團賠償及歸還物資接收委員會專門委員吳沅，專員李神哉等。該機航程約五小時可抵東京，將在羽田機塲降落。屆時我駐日代表團將派員迎接，並照料一切。顧綏嶽鄧純返國　　〔本報訊〕病理學專家顧綏嶽博士，去歲赴美，專攻癌瘤病理學，現乘美琪號輪將於十一抵滬。又法學博士鄧純，前由司法部派赴美國，考察及研究司法實務，歷時四載，亦將於十一日返抵滬。榮德生第六子　開槍處戕畢命　　〔本報訊〕紗粉大王榮德生之第六子榮紀仁，廿六歲，於抗戰時在後方商船學校攻讀，卒業後，往美國學習海軍。月前返國，因抑鬰不得志，竟萌死念，於昨日下午三時許，在高恩路二〇四號寓所，持手槍向後腦部開放二槍自殺。後經家人發覺，亟用車載送醫院施治不及，未幾畢命。各界團體舉行　歡迎赴京立委大會　　〔本報訊〕上海市參議會，市商會，地方協會，記者公會，敎育會，總工會，農會，婦女會等各團體，昨日午後三時假金神父路勵志社招待所，舉行本市各界歡迎赴京立法委員大會，出席之立委，計有程天放，束雲章，江一平，端木愷，劉丕基，鄧公玄，王力航，劉百閔，胡秋原，楊管北，傳汝霖，方志超，奚玉書，傅統先，朱文德，王劍鍔，俞松筠，費俠等二十餘人。由潘議長公展主席，並致歡迎辭。來賓吳市長繼起致辭，次由徐寄廣氏演說；方治，水祥雲致辭後，當由立委束雲章，江一平，費俠等先後致辭。最後由漢口立委熊東皋提議，各地立委赴京出席，途過上海，人地生疏，深望各界能有相當地點，暫供留宿之所，同時可藉此與上海各界領袖見面，聽取意見。潘議長當即表示接受，至五時始吿散會李伯蘭離滬飛東京　在滬選得畫題九件　　〔本報訊〕「信不信由你」漫畫作者李伯蘭已於昨日離滬飛東京。李氏在滬收到之無數稿件中僅選得九件供其漫畫材料，其中八件均爲旅滬外僑所投。李氏給予之酬報第一名爲美金十元，第二名美金七元五角，第三名美金五元，其餘各爲美金一元，由大陸報轉發。第一名內容係述一外僑之父親在蒙古狩獵時，某次射擊山羊未中，而槍聲竟使對山一小鹿，受驚自山上下墮，跌斷脊骨。本報前記某讀者所投一張五千元鈔票之故事亦爲李氏採用，忝列末名云。潦倒法學士　行乞到母校　　日前法政學院門首突來一衣衫襤褸年約三十除歲之靑年求見李院長，據稱名戴驊騏，阜寗人。廿五年在該院法律系畢業。因從故鄕逃難來滬，請院長救濟。適李院長不在，遂留函而去。函云：「院長，敎授先生們，可憐一個老校友吧，我已挨餓三日，沒有食一粒米，妻兒在求乞，我爲了他們才沒有走上自殺之途。如今家鄉被共匪攻陷父兄被匪殘殺母親病死異鄕懇請鈞長予以援救」聞該院當局正籌商救濟辦法舞潮案男女被告　特刑庭繼續偵訊　　〔本報訊〕特刑庭昨偵訊舞潮案，孫體鈐審判官昨上午親赴黃浦警分局提出在押各被吿洪小萍，唐宗傑，胡運源，楊莉莉，對於集體向社局請願及搗毀社局經過，偵訊至詳。並魷近訊問目擊搗毀社局之員警作證。下午傳訊交保在外之被吿舞業公會理事長孫洪元，米高美舞廳總經理鄭煒顯，程寅康，韓彩英，金英，夏少棠，張榮壽，馬鴻奎，吳福根，吳壽根，東森林等九人。（以上九人爲仙樂，米高美，遠東，新都會各舞廳之舞女與大班）。孫洪元因病未到，由乃兄孫鑑馥代表出庭應訊。昨偵訊各點，大致爲搗毀社局原因，動機，及經過情形。各被吿均答供未參加毆打，事後由警察局傳訊，經過情形均不明瞭。其中祗鄭煒顯一人，訊問時間稍長，約三十分鐘，訊畢仍交原保。時庭因孫洪元與該案關係甚大，定今晨九時再訊，並將傳訊肇事時在塲之員警及社會局職員到庭作證。劫案三起　拘獲數盜　　〔本報訊〕滬東惠民路草棚內，上月廿八日最三時許，侵入盜匪三名，均用手帕蒙面，被刧去衣箱二只而逸，事主王惠娟等認出一盜爲相識之小獅子，乃報榆林路警分局，嗣在附近徐福才草棚內，將徐與小獅子拘獲，一併帶局，供認行刧不諱。江浦路交白園路草棚內季錢林家，昨晨二時許，突來四盜，刧去法幣四百萬元，金戒一只，當被事主扭獲一盜名張安祿，並被隣居擒住一盜名陳金富，均送榆林路警分局究辦。　　滬西檳榔路四一〇號周王氏傢，四日晚九時左右，侵入四盜，刧去飾物衣服約值四千萬元而逸，五日午後氏因事經過西康路康定路李家宅附近，瞥見一人，識爲上日行刧之匪徒，報田路人帮同追獲，帶入普陀路警局究辦。招攬進出口生意　冒用輸管會名義　　協華商行主持人被傳訊　　〔本報訊〕協華進出口商行主持人戴天吉，因用輸管會名義，分函各大公司商號，稱受輸管會委託，如需要進口貨色，可向該行登記，俾便向該會接洽。事爲該會所悉，以從未委託任何進出口行接洽此事，顯係戴盜用名義，招搖詐欺，函請地檢處偵查。昨田陸檢察官傳戴訊問，戴供稱此舉係招攬生意之一種方法，別無其他用意。末庭諭仍交原保，改期偵訊。糧價如續有波動　決定無限制供應　吳市長對社會指責謂為揣測之詞　　〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先，民調會主委任顯羣等，昨在社會局商討政府抑制糧價波動之辦法，並檢討民調會最近之業務工作。決自今日起，南北米市塲糧價，如繼續波動時，民調會決無限制在市塲供應，價格將依隔日之收盤行情爲根據。　　政府目前握有大部糧源，故不待美援糧食之抵達，對穩定糧價，具有把握。又昨日產區無錫之米價，仍繼續上漲，惟關係方面認爲上海米價低於產區，由來已久，因運費及其他技術上之因素，不致發生倒流之現象。此次米價之漲，與金鈔紗布價格之狂漲，有密切關係，且互爲因果，當局正盡最大努力，分頭加以平抑。　　〔本報訊〕日來米價上漲，外間指責係受民食調配會提高配米價格影響所致。吳市長昨對此說加以否認，謂此，純係揣測之詞云。文化界小新聞　　顧毓琇，李熙謀，定九日聯袂赴浙，觀察日蝕。（也）　　原子物理學專家汪德昭偕其夫人赴北平省親，聞中央研究院將有聘請之議。（芝）　　虞文新移居溧陽路九〇四弄，房屋佈置一新，將請文化界朋友餐叙。（靜）　　晚周楚族藝術展覽會，今日在林森中路九九〇號香雪園展覽一週，內有木刻人像，漆器用具，銅鏡石刻，均爲長沙出土蔣玄佁畫家收集。（來）　　康謳編著之音樂基本敎程，已交由上海敎育醫店付印，不日即將出版。（吾）　　孫陵主編之「文藝工作」，於「五四」文藝節創刊，由王統照，沈從文，姚雪垠，劉北汜等執筆。（採）　　劉綿松彙輯弘一和尙生平事蹟，編爲年譜，附詩文美術極多，不日付印。（銅）　　作家呂白華日前回鄉，成「再還雜詠」十二首，分寄詩友徽和。有「人心

<p>全運第二日田徑收獲豐　全國紀録三項刷新　男四百米女八十米跳欄及推鉛球　陳英郎王樂義王燦華獲寶貴成績　　〔本報訊〕全運大會昨爲第二日，男女田徑賽節目於下午二時正式開始，雨後放晴，天氣溫和，跑道稍覺鬆軟，否則成績更將出色，但競爭熟烈，男女健兒，大顯身手，造成全國新紀錄者達三項之多，男子一項，女子二項，爲：（一）四百公尺預賽，台灣陳英郎之五十秒七，打破戴淑國之五十一秒六紀錄，（二）八十公尺女子跳欄預賽，河北王樂義之十三秒六，打破錢行素之十四秒三紀錄，（三）北平王燦華之女子推鉛球，十公尺九七，打破馬驥之十公尺三五紀録。第二名台灣張瑞妍十公尺五一，亦破全國紀錄。預次賽之結果，台灣健兒，在短距離中，領導羣雄，一再獲得各組冠軍，錦標前途，大爲光明，田賽決賽中，合灣亦包辦跳高前四名，赫然以十八分半，佔得優勢，女子田賽，昨僅鉛球一項，北平市得一三兩名，獲十一分領先。今日田徑繼續舉行，列將有緊張激烈之競爭，新紀錄之產生，自在預料之中。男跳高成績未達理想　前四名臺灣包辦　女鉛球第一二名均創全國紀録　　男子跳高決賽，參加者四十餘名，直至七時傍晚，才吿結束，台灣選手，大顯威風，包辦前四名，警察黃桂蘭並得第四名，第五名爲馬華之龍歷民。冠軍董飛星，成績一公尺八十，尙未到達理想，據云在台成績，曾到達一公尺八六。跳竿昇至一公尺七一時淘汰成最後六名至一公尺七四，僅董飛星越過，冠軍遂定。最後五人，於是再跳分名次。董飛星爲台灣屛東商人，第四名陳木川，十年前在日本早稻田大學難業，曾有一公尺九一之成績。　　女子推鉛球決賽，果然不出本報預料，北平王燦華以十公尺九七，榮膺冠軍，並打破全國紀錄，第二名台灣女將張瑞妍十公尺五一，亦打破全國紀錄。第三名北平洗少梅，九公尺九四，第四名四川楊淑君，九公尺四六，第五名甘肅羅佟英九公尺三八，第六名河北尹韻英；公尺二七。昨日參加是項者，共計二十九人，「四川之花」李元春，成績僅八公尺六十，但却頗爲人注意。　　冠軍王燦華小姐，爲北平市立體專學生，明夏畢業，練鉛球不過兩年多，現年二十一歲，體重六十四公斤，最高成績爲十二公尺十〇五，鐵餅亦爲傑作，可以擲到三十三公尺三七，刷新全國紀錄，當無問題。王小姐山東泰安人，三十六年在濟南懿範女中時，在濟南運動會中初露頭角。第三名洗少梅，爲北平市體專同班同學，其鐵餅成績爲之十一公尺，亦極有希望。　　第二名張瑞妍，小巧玲瓏，爲台灣高雄市立女中數學敎師，其能有此優越成績，並非靠力氣，而是方法正確純熟，所以每次所推的成績，皆比前一次進步跳高第一屆飛星（本報攝）田徑預次賽經過概述　台選手出盡風頭　　昨日田徑第一日，除田賽二項決賽，徑賽計男子預賽五項，次賽二項，女子預賽二項。徑賽男子組中台灣選手，出盡風頭，大受歡呼，而陳英郎更在四百公尺預賽中，打破全國紀錄。　　百公尺預次賽　百公尺預賽十二組，台灣得三組第一，一組第二，成績平平，當係頸賽關係。次賽分五組舉行，結果台灣健兒，依然前導，三個第一，一個第二。高山族選手徐天德更造十一秒正之優異紀錄，許通壓倒上海容承彪，已掃除頸賽時之不振，成績十一秒二，爲昨日百米二個最佳之成績。　　四百公尺預次賽　四百公尺塲昨日預賽最受注意之一項，第六組陳英郎一馬當先，拋落第二名達十餘公尺，其五十秒七之成績，勝來輕鬆異常，一斑認爲尙有餘力可以進步，其餘各組成績平平，皆在五十四五秒之間，僅台灣陳文炎得第十組第一，五十三秒一，亦殊可觀。及至次賽，陳英郎因在參加異程接力之後，成績改爲五十三秒二，惟仍爲次賽中，成績最佳之一組。台灣選手包辦四百公尺冠亞軍，當無問題。五十秒七之紀錄，亦爲昨日最寶貴之收穫。　　高欄預賽　高欄預賽爲昨日成績最爲失望之一項，跨欄姿勢步法，鮮有合法，倒欄累累，於是成績竟近乎十八秒，惟望複決賽，能有所進步。預賽結果，以馬華空軍台灣上海，最佔優勢。　　千五百公尺預賽　分三組舉行，啞吧樓文敖放棄未曾下塲，以第三組老將于希渭（空軍）成績四分廿二秒二最佳，去賈連仁之四分十一秒一，相去尙遠。靑島名將劉景琨（現隷海軍）居第二，其餘二組成績平平。　　千五異程接力　千五公尺異程接力，爲一百，二百，四百，八百之綜接力，必須長短跑實力同樣平均者，方有精彩，昨日在各項預賽之後，各隊皆以副將出塲，甘肅隊得第二組第一，壓倒廣東，難能可貴，過程相當緊張。成績以第一三兩組台灣上海兩隊較佳。　　女子百公尺頸賽　分十組舉行，廣東李小璧身輕如燕，十四秒正，成績最佳，其次爲重慶李心一，十四秒一，李小姐在重慶打破全國紀錄，將與台灣張甘妹漢口鍾金銘，有一番劇爭。其餘各組，成績平平，竟有達十五秒者。（全國紀錄爲十三秒五）　　女子跳欄頸賽　相當精彩，一破全國紀錄，一平全國紀錄，王樂義崔愛麟俱爲河北省選手，將來冠亞軍不生問題。王樂義家學淵源，訓練有年，跳來輕鬆，綽有餘裕。其他三組，成績相差太遠，第四組廣東小姐黃藏平，跳來甚佳，最後一欄，跌撲跑道上，膝蓋擦破，當經廣東領隊趕來，安慰一番。否則可得第二名，殊爲可惜。男子田賽　第一日得分　　台灣　十八分半　　警察　二分半　　馬華　一分女子田賽　第一日得分　　北平　十一分　　台灣　五分　　四川　三分　　甘肅　二分　　河北　一分昨日球賽結果　　足球次賽　　暹羅　福建　六比〇　　警察　四川　十二比一　　男子籃球　　江蘇勝漢口　四八比四〇　　聯勤勝哈兩濱　五九比二六　　廣東勝河南　三九比三六　　福建勝江西　三九比二四　　海軍勝廣西　六七比三六　　印尼勝貴州　四五比四一　　天津勝浙江　五五比四二　　上海勝西貢　六四比一九　　陸軍勝吉林　七五比二八　　警察勝暹羅　五一比三八　　香港勝湖南　五九比三三　　瀋陽勝湖北　四六比三六　　南京勝甘肅　五三比三九　　空軍勝新疆　六一比三一　　馬來亞勝靑島　四〇比二八　　菲律賓勝安徽　六四比三六女子籃球　　女子籃球　　南京勝江西　三〇比十四　　湖北勝警察　三五比三三　　菲律賓勝河南　二九比一〇　　福建勝青島　二九比二二　　上海勝湖南　一六比九　　印尼勝貴州　三九比七　　廣州勝浙江　三五比一九　　河北勝江蘇　三二比二〇　　男子排球　　上海勝湖南　三比〇　　陸軍勝南京　三比〇　　空軍勝浙江　三比一　　聯勤勝新疆　三比一　　香港勝河南　三比〇　　警察勝吉林　三比〇　　福建勝海軍　三比〇　　女子排球　　台灣勝安東　二比〇且看今日田徑決賽  本報記者　胡隆昶　章繩治　　〔本報特寫〕今日田賽女跳高，男標槍，男跳遠三個決賽項目中，比較有打破全國紀錄的，當推女跳高和男標槍二項。陳瀛振彈性足　與吳樹森可別苗頭　　女跳高河北吳樹森預選時，有一米三六五的成績，已破朱天眞一米三五五的全國紀錄。如無意外，今天應該穩得冠軍。此外，上海陳瀛振，去年在上海市運會時，一鳴驚人，之後，成積筆頭日上。聽說陳小姐近况很好，練習時成績，常在一米三四左右，陳小姐彈性足，可與吳樹森一別苗頭。台灣邱月嬌的一米三一五，靑島王鴻蘭的一米三〇，都相當够勁，可以會師逐鹿一番。男標槍新紀録　可能性恐難於創造　　男標槍創造新紀錄的可能性，祗能說是五十對五十。主要的要看海軍王學武的近况怎樣。王一度曾有五十五公尺二的優異成績，不過這究竟是一次的偶中。因爲：王經常的成績，終在五十米相近。所以除非他養精蓄銳，近况極佳，新紀錄的可能性是極少的。不過，陸軍陳濟川的四十九米九二，合灣徐天德的四十八米九〇，也都威脅性極大。宿將張星賢輩　請加添一點油如何　　男跳遠想出七米大關，希望很是渺茫，馬華李芬說是有過過七米〇六的成績，不過近年來成績退步，僅祗六米三四左右的紀錄，我們仍寄厚望於台灣健兒們。像張立人的六米六四，此公彈性甚足，可能創造更優異的紀錄。此外，仍望跳遠宿將張星賢，老將王士林，張嘉夔輩，老當益壯，再接再厲，替跳遠新紀錄，加一番油如何？　　百公尺竸爭必烈　今日徑賽男子組四項決賽中最感覺興趣的，將莫過於一百公尺決賽。照昨天次賽結果看來，頭二名將仍是許通和徐天德的天下。徐天德已進步到十一秒正，恰與許通過去的最高紀錄相等，如果許通爲了養精蓄銳，保持原氣的話，那末今天的決賽，不特有激烈之競爭，而且紀錄可能打進十一秒關。第三名的爭奪，將是今天最難判斷的事，台灣林秋江，馬來楊春美，空軍冷培樹，海軍王競武，和上海王松濤，容啓彪的實力，幾乎相差極微，河北的劉咸陽和山東的黃驤，近來成績都沒有進步，得分的希望，或者要出冷門了。　　于希渭所向無敵　一千五百公尺決賽，這一項中距離跑老將于希渭依然保持所向無敵的局面，雖然成績已遠較往日退步多多，但因繼起無人，迄難打破，由此可以看出國內中距離的人材的貧乏。老于全協時代，曾經有過三分五十九秒的紀錄，成績倒退如是之遠，幾難令人置信。　　海陸空得分有望　預料今日決賽中，湖北楊連陞和海軍劉景琨有爭奪二三名的可能，空軍薛鵬奎，河北馬連城，陸軍倪泅，則有得分希望。　　一千五百公尺異程接力決賽，台灣可以得第一，空軍上海可以搶第二。海軍如何，則完全寄托於第四棒老將于希渭的八百米身上。這次甘肅的成績，亦稱不弱，屆時可一爭名次。　　黃兩正高欄稱雄　男子高欄決賽，馬華黃兩正的冠軍希望極濃厚，跨欄和踏步都相當有勁。同隊的陳進吉亦是一個健將可能搶得第二第三名，北平的徐寶臣，台灣的賴有德，實力亦殊可觀，其次空軍的方傑臣李叔軍，粵省的孫鈞，和上海的李震中，亦都有得分希望。女子推鉛球第一王燦華（本報攝）　　四百公尺第一名陳英郎（本報攝）　　女子跳欄破全國紀綠（右）崔愛麟（左）王樂義（本報攝）　　女子八十公尺低欄預賽（本報攝）男子舉重比賽　陶福亨龍偉德兩名手　贏得滿塲掌聲　次輕量級破世界紀録　　〔本報訊〕男子十舉重比賽、昨下午二時在國術塲舉行，輕量級先行比賽選手有陶福亨（馬），周文理（印），種華鈿（穗），胡維予（滬），在紹章（滬），卜文德（豫）等六人，分雙手推舉、雙手提舉雙手挺舉三種。陶福亨爲馬來亞華僑舉重名手，姿勢美妙，訓練有素，曾歷破英，馬紀錄，除上海胡維予，印尼華僑周文理兩人可略與抗衡外，勝來殊易，耙錄：推舉爲八七·五公斤，提舉八二·五公斤，挺舉一〇五公斤，合共二七五公斤，榮獲冠軍。第二名胡維予，二五〇公斤，第三名周文理二四五公斤，第四名上海汪紹章，二三七·五公斤。次輕量級冠軍亦爲馬來亞奪獲，選手龍偉德，曾在馬來亞以兩手抓舉一九三·五磅，為同級美國特烏鳴羅所創造之一九二又八分之七磅之世界最高紀錄，舉來精神抖擻，贏得滿塲掌聲。記錄：推舉八〇公斤，提舉八十五公斤，挺舉一〇五公斤，合共二七〇公斤，惟較輕量級冠軍記錄尙少五公斤。第二名警察隊陸震鶴二六〇公斤，第三名漢口楊民權，二四七·五公斤，第四名警察隊朱林根二四五公斤。　　馬來亞輕量級女舉重能手何麗英，在馬極享盛譽，曾以雙手挺舉擊砂同級美國安里佛女士所保持之成績。當男子舉重比賽時，渠亦出塲參觀，爲攝影記者加以包圍，因此次全運會中除何女士外，並無其他代表參加舉重一項，乃請渠表演，渠對擎舉五·六十公斤之鐵盤，似毫不費力，臂力之强，令人昨舌！　　今日下午，仍在原地繼續舉行中輕，次重，重量三級舉重賽。（育）兩塲足球賽都是一面倒　暹華警察雙獲捷　福建吃六隻蛋·四川負十一球　　〔本報訊〕足球初賽第二日，上午暹華與福建，在田徑塲交綏，下午警察逢四川於逸園。上午一塲，暹華以六對〇輕取福建；下午警察以十二對一之巨大比數大勝四川。因一夜豪雨，塲地泥濘不堪，兼之晨起寒意甚濃，偌大之看台，座客寥寥無幾，暹華隊技術佳妙，局勢成一面倒，急得福建足球領隊在塲邊頻呼加油，然始終無補頹勢，過程中亦迄未聞有一起掌聲，致情形殊爲冷落。　　下午景况大不相同，逸園座上熱鬧非凡，川籍人士及警界到塲旁觀者甚多，各爲川警兩隊吶喊助威，市警局長俞叔平亦偕家屬蒞止參觀，頻頻爲警察隊鼓掌。其時烈日當空，氣候轉熱，冷飲類銷塲大好。而川隊連連敗績，警隊踢來出神入化，結果終以十二對一大勝，造成今年來在本市舉行足球賽未有之最高差數。昨警隊始終努力，並不以紀錄迭增而鬆懈，川隊雖居劣勢，亦愈戰愈勇，精神均極可佩。傘兵表演　定五九舉行　　〔中央社訊〕傘兵表演，定本月九日（星期日）中午十二時至下午三時，在虹橋飛機塲舉行。是項表演，將由滬市最高軍事長官宣司令鐵吾領導，並由陸軍總部第二署署長孫國銓及傘兵副司令徐炎武，親自主持。聞是項表演舉行時，將有大

<p>女子籃球初賽　印菲滬京等告捷　福建戰青島局面最緊張　印尼壓倒貴州嘆為觀止　　〔本報訊〕女子籃球初賽，昨日共八塲，分別在第二，第六，籃球塲舉仃。其中除福建對肯島一塲，競爭劇烈，上海對湖南有意外緊張局面以外，餘均形成一面倒。各塲之中，當以印尼大勝貴州一幕，最受觀衆激賞。茲分誌各塲戰情如次：　　南京戰江西　南京對江西，上午九時在第二球塲接觸。胡慰玲首開紀錄，京隊隨以六比一領前，江西張美瑗問有投中，成爲一路追隨之局勢。南京三前鋒皆短小身材，惟射籃準確，加以守衛嚴密，前鋒無後顧之憂，譚碧雲不絕將球供輸前方，胡慰玲，王其曼，連珠擲入，分數扶搖直上。第三節以後，一度成爲三十比九，江西胡園梅獨力支持，終塲爲三十比十四，南京勝江西。裁判舒鴻劉荷生。　　南京　犯分　江西　犯分　　高詠蒲　一一　張美瑗　四九　　譚碧雲　〇〇　胡圓梅　一五　　胡慰玲　四三　談崇嘏〇〇　　王其曼　一三　毛禮鎂　四〇　　胡兆玲　四〇　熊圓麗　二〇　　靳榮裕　〇四　雷淑　四〇　　樂連琴　四〇　黃鳳英　一〇　　鄭杏鮮　三〇　合計　一六一四　　合計一七三〇　　湖北勝警察　湖北對管察之戰，同時在第六球塲舉有，後者實爲上海前綫隊之變相，不料湖北三鋒，勇猛異常，尤以何躉莉擲籃工夫超人一等，警察守衛無法阻擋。上半時湖北以二十二比十二佔優，下半時開始不久，警察主將錢楚屛傷足雕塲，强弩之末，無可挽救，卒以二十三比三十五敗陣。裁判宋君復陳均謨。　　菲隊勝河南　十時起，菲律賓與河南續在第二球塲交綏，菲隊多屬黑白隊員，前年曾一度返國比賽。菲隊動作敏捷，轉身靈活，河南相形見絀，上半時猶能極力撑拒，僅以十四比八落伍，其後益見不支，卒以二十九比十敗陣。裁判王守方，祝明星。　　福建勝青島　福建對靑島爲昨日女籃最精彩之一幕，十時在第六球塲舉行。福建先以九比一佔絕對優勢，第一節吿終，靑島迫成十二比十，下半時更迭造各十五，十六，各十八，三次平手，福建平均人較矮小，氣力不逮靑島，後衛吳玉物原屬菲黑白隊，身材肥碩，表演未見出色，幸賴宿將陳聚才與許心喜之努力，以二十九二十二獲得勝利。裁判陸翔千，張覺非。　　上海勝湖南　上海對湖南，十一時於第二球塲舉行。湖南守衛得力，上海勝來並不容易，距上牛時終了尙有十秒鐘，計時員敲纙，曾因此發生紛擾，旋即平靜。此少計之十秒鐘，即併入第三節舉行，結果上海卒以十六比九獲勝，上半時爲八比六。裁判陸翔千，張覺非。　　印尼　下午二時起，在第二球塲連續有三塲交鋒。首塲爲貴州對印尼貴州隊在杭曾有精彩表演，不意印尼發揮優異技術，舉動快捷，搶擇地位準確，閃避轉身巧妙靈活，投籃更神乎其技，頓使觀衆凝神欣賞。錦標一席，印尼在所必爭。上半時二十比三，貴州僅罰入三分。總結三十九比七，貴州慘敗。裁判宋君復，聞宗元。　　廣州勝浙江　浙江對廣州繼在原地舉行，浙江球藝平庸，廣州平均人較高大，速度活潑均超渦對手，三比三以後，浙江即一落千丈，上半成二十六比九，終局三十五比十九，廣州吿捷。　　河北勝江蘇　最後一塲爲河北逢江蘇，局勢雖形均衡，但無精彩可言，動作拖泥帶水，混亂之至。上半爲十五比六，總結三十二比二十，皆河北勝。裁判吳子彬。今天有四塲　福建南京必有劇戰　印尼可勝廣州　　今日共有女子籃球次賽四塲：上海對河北，河北實力不過爾爾，上海昨日表演，雖未達平日水準，今日獲勝希望仍極濃厚。湖北隊前鋒猛銳非常，何蔓莉，吳樹先均爲可畏人物，今遇菲律賓，必予對方極大威脅。湖北隊作風爽辣，與菲隊之靈巧活潑絕不相同，可期刺激精彩之演出。印尼爲昨日表演最優異的一隊，廣州實力尙稱不弱，恐終非印尼之敵。南京隊攻守平均，前鋒胡慰玲，王其曼嬌小玲瓏，身手靈活，射籃甚具把握，福建多屬經騐宏富之宿將，勢將有劇烈之競爭，勝利屬誰，不敢輕易斷定。（年）男籃一篇流水賬　上海大勝西貢精彩百出　貴州力戰印尼驚險萬狀　　〔本報訊〕全運籃球賽，第二日尙係初賽。共有十六塲，結果瀋陽勝湖北，福建巧取江西，警察逼敗暹邏，陸軍攻克吉林，香港大勝湖南，海軍制伏廣西，廣東力奪河南，福建巧取江西，江蘇攻敗漢口，天津擊退浙江，南京力勝甘肅，空軍平服新疆，貴州小勝印尼，菲律賓力克安徽，聯勤大勝哈爾濱，馬來亞戰勝靑島，內貴州對印尼，一為西南之邊遠東省份，一篇海外歸僑，弟兄相見分外興奮，故打來熱烈緊張，得未曾有。茲將各隊比賽情形，略述於后：　　湖北對瀋陽　上午九時，瀋陽以堅强之姿態，硬派之作風，與湖北對抗，一路領先，湖北屢圖反攻，均未獲逞。惟是役兩隊均打，區域防衛法疏漏殊多，致雙方均能乘隙獲得籃下球，跟踪與切入之方法，僅在偶然間得見。結果四十六對卅六，瀋陽勝，未見精彩。裁判員陳寳琳·章文原。　　福建對江西　上午九時。於第五籃球塲舉行。福建擁有好手蔡世典（文章）黃柏齡等，實力較勝一籌，故自始至終，控制全塲。江西林耀祖先開紀錄，蔡世典立還顏色，黃柏齡擲罰連連，瞬即以十三比二，一馬當先。江西雖二度呼停，未見效果。閩將於取於携，上半時以廿七比十三領前七球。易籃後，閩隊以生力軍上陣，江西雖謀反攻，力仍不逮。終以廿四比卅九被淘汰。　　警察對暹邏　上午九時，警察爲本市勁旅仁餘晨友之化身，暹邏爲僑胞中之優秀選手，兩方開戰後，均採人頂人法，暹邏選手身體壯健，其中十一號縱躍頗高，甚爲「殺搏」。惟遞球較緩，射籃欠準，上半時終以二十四對十五小挫，後半時該隊力取攻勢，加快速度，頗有起色。無如警察射籃準確，小心翼翼，始終不衰。結果警察以五十一對三十八獲勝。裁判爲黃少良·陳頌良。　　陸軍對吉林　兩隊繼之登塲，吉林實力似乎平庸。陸軍則自始至終，遙遙前領。陳廣·李祥福·曾柳池之神射，使吉林諸將，無從抵禦。結果陸軍以七十五比三十大勝。　　香港對湖南　十時舉行，香港爲華南勁旅，湖南爲有名湘軍，觀衆對此頗感興趣。惟香港打來頗爲靈活巧妙，致使湖南反攻不易，形成緊緊跟隨，不能超前之勢。而香港咄咄遍人。獲分纍纍，因以戰果赫赫，結果以五十九對三十三，大敗湖南。裁判員爲王基恩·胡宗藩。　　海軍對廣西　上午十一時在第六球塲舉行，前者擁有汕隊及征輪之好手馬燦希·何立德·于瑞章·及劉政軍等，實力甚大，聯絡方面，亦有默契。開賽之初，馬·劉·及紮行，先後三投，均碰籃圈彈出，反被揭逢年乘間突入擲中，廣西先掛兩分，干瑞章顯示射籃絕技，雙方皆偏甫進攻而懈於守衛，海軍個人技術較勝一籌，卒以六十七比三十六大勝。裁判宣鶴皋·祝明星。　　廣東對河南　十一時戰幕展開。以實力言，嶺南戰士，較勝一籌，故上半時一路佔先，領前達九分之多。易籃後，廣東隊稍一疎忽，竟被河南迎頭趕上，終塲前四分鐘，卅三比廿九，河南赫然反勝二球。百粵健兒，緊張過度，屢投不入，幸塲邊啦啦隊竭力打氣，諸將亦悟欲速不達之理，沉着應戰，卒以卅九比卅六平反敗局，死裏逃生。　　上海對西貢　上午十一時舉行，上海隊係混合華聯火公兩隊而成，實力至强，西貢雖知大敵當前，但亦決不示弱，交兵之初，上海以人頂人戰術出之，而西貢則似打區域防衛，因以上海易守易攻，西貢則攻守均感爲難，上海頻頻獲分，扶搖直上，迅成不可一世之氣慨，假動作愈來愈多，觀衆呌好不已，而個人技術之表演，掩蔽台作團結之精神，後衛每多持球切入，前鋒亦均各自投籃，此役雖以六十四對十九大勝西貢，然戰來毫無是處。　　江蘇對漢口　下午二時在第六球塲舉行，江蘇擁有張嘉藝，李祖德等宿將，梁文華即甲申隊健將梁雄標之化名，但全隊合作未臻純熟，漢口隊人材平均，因此始終陷入苦戰，江蘇賴經騐較優，力恃鎭定，梁文華於最後關頭，連入三球，奠定勝局。結果四十八比四〇。　　浙江對天津　於下午二時會師，如浙江實力，一本報記者所料，似無若何特長，然尙能奮鬥，其敗也技不如人，然擁有老將如傅金聲等，天津勝來（五二比三九）亦非易易。浙江諸將，雖敗猶榮。下午三時舉行，南京甘肅之戰，都以氣力勇猛見長，方法陣勢尙未見應用。南京程春榮投籃最準，甘肅射籃稍遜一籌，南京雖始終領先，惟一度被追至尙差二分，結果仍被南京以五十三對三十九克服甘肅。裁判宣鶴皋，吳效堤。　　新疆與空軍　亦與吉陸之役相仿，局勢始終一面倒。凌雲壯士，勝來未費吹灰之力。上半時紀錄爲卅四比十一，終塲飛將軍以六一比三一勝新疆。　　貴州對印尼　下午二時舉行。印尼先聲奪人，首開紀錄，貴州罰中一球，成二比一，後衛截獲一球，遠遞前鋒，又告命中，成三比一，貴州反佔先一分。印尼前鋒乘隙攻入對方陣地，左鋒躍起投球落網，又爲印尼佔先一分。是時緊張萬狀，球迷吶喊不已，雙方均有犯規。上半時結束，貴州僅佔先三分。　　下半時易地再戰，貴州拚力進攻，後衛又犯規，候顯揚罰出，印尼聲威大振，貴州馬振堃急遞郭建東，郭射的又中，黃龍聲又中，是時印尼已落後七分。貴州馬振堃又罰出，印尼乘機反攻，分數益見接近，相差五分，而四分，而一分，而一分，觀衆興奮異常，在喊加油。貴州前鋒中的，黃龍聲錦上添花，又超前五分。印尼罰得一分，時間不再，大局已定。結果四十五對四十一，貴州力克印尼。　　菲律濱對安徽　下午四時舉行，此役衆料菲律濱必可輕取，開戰之初，安徽郭杰先中二分，繼又加二分，使菲島健兒不得不小心應付，始得追回兩分。而安徽攻勢猶猛，旋菲島陳金置頻頻中的，安徽霍劍平奮不顧身，被判罰球，於是菲島分數扶搖直上，惟安徽始終如一，緊緊追趕。後霍劍平，郭杰，均遭罰出，乃大勢已去，菲島終以六十四對三十六奏凱。裁判楊烈誠，王亦樵。　　哈爾濱對聯勤　一般預料聯勤必可取勝，惟不料輕易至此。比賽於下午三時在第六球塲舉行，聯勤光以汽十六全班人馬上塲，聯絡純熟，進攻則快銳無比，退守則遝用五人聯防法嚴密無間，加以人人能射，上半時因以三十比八領先。下半時聯勤起用廣東隊卜·林·李·張·四人，哈爾濱乘對方陣脚鬆亂之際攻入兩球，聯勤諸將運用花巧之傳遞，突破對方防衛，卜·林·兩人，從容投中，哈爾濱無力還抗，聯勤遂以五十九比二十六吿捷。　　馬華對青島　馬華第一戰，與前日淘汰熱河之靑島相遇，山東壯士，都爲彪形大漢，故馬華諸將，勝來亦頗吃力，前半比數爲十七對十，最後靑島于得海罰出，馬華遂得再添數球，以四十比廿七勝。手錶待領　　〔本報訊〕復興中學童子軍曹德淳昨在會塲中拾得手錶一只，現存東司令台一〇一室交通組王端君處，盼失主見報後，即往領取。　　昨日跳高塲內，有人失落鑰匙一把，爲一童子軍拾得後，到處找尋失主，其服務精神頗堪嘉許。籃球電動計時器　錢旭滄設計完成　　滬市籃球委員會主席錢旭滄，前曾在體育界發明凱旋門球及圓桌乒乓等，最近復悉心研究籃球計時記分器具之改進，茲悉錢君對於籃球電動計時器，已先設計完成，（附圖）查該項器具本身，主要部份：分「自動報時」及「暫停燈」二部份。在男子兩節制比賽開始時，「自動報時」處顯示剩餘時間爲「二十」分，以後時間每過一分鐘，該處即向動减少一分鐘，至「〇」分爲止。「暫停燈」爲暫停時計時員所用，嵌動開關，時間停止，紅燈顯示，以表公允。頃聞錢君擬將此項新穎之計時器，無條件貢獻於全運會當局，俟當局核准後，即可裝置在體育館應用。優待全運選手　訂閱本報郵費免收　　本報優待全運選手，於大會開會期間，凡在會塲本報辦事處訂閱本報者，不論寄至國內國外，所需郵費槪不另收，一律由本館負擔，國內儘量利用航空寄遞，以期迅速，各地選手鑒於本報消息完備，服務周到，紛紛預訂，昨日訂報人數，更見擁擠，本報辦事處同人手揮目送，工作倍形緊張。上海與湖南籃球賽（本報攝）會塲內外速寫　上海女籃球選手捋袖訴苦　國衛家談佟佩華笑容可掬　　〔本報訊〕前天下了一夜雨，有多少人担心運動會要受影響，結果昨晨天氣轉陰，微有陽光，冷熱適中，灰塵不揚，反成了個大好運動天。　　觀衆大减，來者多帶雨衣一件，獨缺「一家門出動」的鏡頭。　　菲律賓隊選手，加披大黃緞子外套，身價畢竟不同。　　南面來的怕冷，北面來的娥熱。台灣馬來亞選手多添着紫醬色運動絨衫。　　台灣女選手，手提小花包袱各一隻，日本氣息似乎濃重得很。　　上海女子籃球與湖南隊比賽，據聞曾起風波，爲了早停十秒鐘，有一上海女選手左前臂被銅鑼擦起了一條血痕，逢人就捋袖訴苦。　　掛有浙江領隊襟條的一位先生，在塲內狹板凳上打睦睡，幾乎仰天一跤。　　國術裁判員佟忠義，白髮銀鬚，梳了道士頭，提起佟佩華，說是：「我的姑娘」，滿面笑容可掬！　　國術女選手六九八號，舞劍時臀部着地，兩脚前後成直綫，幾次要爬起來，幾次爲

<p>自由談一個例子  平齋　　一個小小例子，可以證明上海難民問題之嚴重。　　我每天從虹口寓所坐三輪車到黄浦區的寫字問辦公時，乍浦路橋是必經之路。去年此時，每逢天氣陰雨，馬路濘滑的日子，我總是到了橋堍便叫車夫停車，自己下來步行過橋，然後再坐上車子，繼續前進。好像是到了去年的下半年罷，橋堍上就總有幾個而有菜色的孩子們候着，專門推三輪車或人力車上橋，不過人數一共祇有三四個。他們把你推到了橋頂後，你給他一張五百塊錢的鈔票，他們就向你說一聲謝謝，很滿足了　　但是到了近來却大不相同。一推車過橋一似乎已經成為一種很興旺的企業，蘇州河上每一頂摘的南北堍都有一個專門管理「推車者」的一大亨一，他把這些　　推車者」嚴密地糾織了起來，每一個一推車者」得到了錢就必須交給他，再由他平均分配，而他自己則不勞而獲，坐拿一扣頭一。我曾經屢次目覩一位「大亨」分　的情形—我的印象是：推車的孩子們（現在也有成人參加了）之面有菜色如故，而那位「大亨」却是衣冠楚楚，毫無營養不良的樣一十　　不願參加這些「推車組織」的人們怎樣呢？他們在橋堍已無立足之地（硬擠進去是要挨打的），就祗得把他們的勞力廉價傾銷。為了爭取主顧，他們寗可多推一段路，少拿一點錢。於是在馬路旁邊鵠候着的推車者的行列，漸漸的愈來愈長。仍舊拿乍浦路橋來舉例例罷，橋北推車者的行列已經逐漸由橋堍延長到武昌路，而塘沽路，最近簡直延長到崑山路了。你的車剛到乍浦路崑山路口時，就有七八個人搶着向你苦苦哀求，請你許他推你的三輪軍—他願意述推過三條橫馬路，再推你上橋，而要求的報酬却和從橋堍推車的人們相同，祗要五千元：一塊大餅的代價。　　競爭之激烈是因為競爭的人實在愈來愈多；而這些競爭者之所以愈來愈多的原因，却是到上海來的難民愈來愈多了。　　對於在橋堍推三輪車來維持生活的難民們，我是非常同情的，他們以自己的勞力換到果腹的大餅，可謂仰不愧於天，俯不怍於人。不過，競爭者已經如此之多，而且還有繼續增多的趨勢，那麼將來這塊大餅就愈來愈不易到手。這也就是說，一二個流浪到上海來的壯漢們是可能憑自己的力氣來生存的，但今天的難民問題旣已成為一個整個的社會問題，解決起來就不簡單了。　　這個局面使我想起了行總，但目前國內急待救濟的人雖遠較行總成立時為多，而行總却已壽終正寢了。而且，即使行總今日尚能存在，恐怕對這些難民的救濟也很難致力的。據我所知，行總在得到聯總的救濟品之前，先曾提出了一個很具體很詳細的善後救濟程序，這個「程序」經過聯總核准之後，聯總才七折八扣地發給這「程序」上所舉的需要的物資，關於難民的部份，這份「程序」上原有遣送和工賑的計　，但這些計　中却並沒有包括近兩年來的龐大的難民數字。　　我們以常識推想，總以為地方政府應當負起緊急救濟的責任，然而我們所聽到看到的，却是：社會局裏的一位先生在提倡高明無比的「不給遝動」，而難民們籌款購置了三輪車，請求在郊外踏三輪車度生時，公用局的當局却來一個拒絕發給牌照！對於後者，我們老百姓倒並不感到意外—公用局旣一天到晚的忙於研究調整公用事業價格，自然也就難怪他們無暇顧及什麼難民。　　可是，上海馬路上扶老携幼的難民却已愈來愈多，生活艱難，慘不忍覩。長此下去，眼見得今日之貧病交迫者，不久就要淪於溝　。人民流離失所，政府總不能不管。地方政府的反應如此，我們就祇得矚望中央了。在這政府面目一新的時候，但願袞袞諸公體上天好生之德，想想法子—千萬不要學了上海社會局和公用局裏那幾位老　的榜樣！投射心理  史郁　　譬如月球的光亮由太陽投射而來，人與人相互間的觀察，思想，或品評，也往往是這樣無中生有的投射而來，投射而去。當你快樂的時候，你覺得下人在為你脫帽，老闆娘在向你調情，小鳥在爲你歌唱；當你「低調」的時候，你覺得下人在向你「抬槓」，老　娘在向你揶揄，小鳥在為你哀號。當你衣袋很輕的時候，你覺得人們好像都曉得你是一個窮漢。當你外套上少了半顆鈕扣，或旗袍角上破了一個小洞，你就再也不肯往外跑了，好似路人都會看得你少了半顆鈕扣或多了一個破洞一樣。鄰家的少女壓根兒對你落花無意，你却以為她對你流水有情。你只要愛上了這個少女，偶而一笑，你就以為她是對你而笑；偶而一　，你就以為她是對你而　。一個有名的「單戀」的故事說：一個維也納少婦愛上了當代有名的提琴家柏格尼尼，她竟然發現了柏格尼尼也愛上了她，因為每次當他演奏完畢向聽衆深深一躬時，總覺得他是對她而笑的。這樣的例子，恐怕「紅樓夢」一書，即可找出一打。現實的環境中更是俯拾即得，也許你即有過這樣的經騐。　　我們是很難準確的觀察自己一的。即就最簡單的容貌而言，攬鏡自照，快樂時將自己看成美麗，消沉時將自己看成其貌不揚。內心的觀察自然是更難了。除非我們能　脫「情感」，休想將別人觀察得準確。我只要有一點點的討厭你，我就看得你的壞處太多，看得你的好處太少。我們若用英雄的眼光來看拿破崙，他即是一個英雄；我們若用矮子的眼光來看拿破崙，他即是一個矮子。　好比善變的孫悟空一樣，十八個朋友可以將你看成十八個樣子，因為人人用小人之心射了你君子之腹。　　一個喜貪小便宜　主婦，對於電力公司的帳單表示懷疑，想公司當局是否會多算一度。一個孤獨的朋友在他的日記裏自辨：「並不是我不肯接近別人，是別人不肯親近我。一但這是一而最可靠的鏡子：假如你常常覺得人們在猜欵你，你自己即是一個多疑的人；假如你常常覺得人們在嫉妒你，你自已即是一個善嫉的人。假如你常常看得事物的光亮的一面，你是一個快樂的人；假如你常常看得事物陰暗的一面，你是一個傷感的人。假使你覺得他人都不近人情，那多半是你自已先不近人情。兩個朋友常常在下述情形下破裂：甲乙二人因芝蔴大的事鬧了意見，甲就以為乙對他不懷好意，乙就以為甲對他存心不良。兩個人這樣的投射而來投射而去，雖然兩個人心地都很善良，但日子一久，投射得愈不「善良」，只得割席。　　人與人的關係如此。國與國的關係也未嘗不是這個樣子。假如國家相互問的猜疑長遠存在，戰爭終有突發的一天。史家吿訴我們：從西歷耙元前一四九六年到紀元一八六一年間的三千三百五十七年中，三千一百卅年在戰爭，祇有二百廿七年是和平的日子。即平均每打十三年休息一年，然後再打十三年，如此輪廻不已·人類的善戰正似朋友的割席一樣，也多半是投射（Project）而成的。西伯利亞的奇  冷冷　　據考古麼家與地質學家研究，在幾萬年前，歐亞連接之區，有一種古代巨象，牠們和冰川同向北方退走，到了西伯利亞，因為沼池太多，無法前進，經最後掙扎後，無數巨象終於沉陷入極度寒冷的泥濘沼地中，在長年不融解的冰雪中凍死。　　這些巨象，雖經過幾萬年的時間，到現在還被天然的大冰箱保存得很完整。不僅巨象的肉，皮毛，就是牠們胃裏的未消化的食物，也是保存得原封不動；像一束束的苔類，菖蒲，以及野草之類，甚至還在嘴中未咀嚼過。　　因此許多西伯利亞農民發現了這些巨象後，割下牠們大塊的紅色肉來餵狗，無異取給於地下食料倉庫。　　西伯利亞生長的烏拉草，幾千年來不斷地蔓延，又接連地死亡着。死亡了的草，剩下腐爛的草根，二層又一層的鋪在地面上，相互交　虬結，終於溶化成泥土，構成地表面層。因為是草根構成的，這地表面層上的泥土特別鬆軟，好像是一大片幾十丈厚的海綿體，虛悠悠地懸掛在空中，旣軟又富有彈性；人走在上面，連幾十里以外的地方都會震動起來，好像在沙發床上跳舞一樣。語絲  晉霖　　氣量越小，口氣越大。——考克　　輿其膚漢的知道許多事情，不如澈底的知道一些事　——福斯狄克　　不要因失敗而傷心；不要因勝利而昏狂。——伊利奇　　意志堅定是成功之本。——迪士萊里　　在一樁亭未完成之前，　傲是沒有用的，即使是成功了，也不必自豪，有事實在。——　特羅　　若要年老時榮譽，必須乘少壯時建起名譽。——易卜生　　勝利時別誇大，失敗時別推託。——伊壁鳩路再談別字  翼雲　　前曾列舉別事故事，刊諸本報，茲又憶及二事，分述如次。　　抗戰時，避地川東，其地文化，素稱閉塞，專員某，以提倡文化爲己任，於孔子誕日，召開大會，當地某紳，亦登台講演，其開口第一語，是「今日為孔子誕辰」，但誕字竟讀別為「延」，其徒知其誤，連在傍低呼曰「誕……」，某驚悟，匆遽間即改稱日一今日爲孔延　」，於是舉座大笑。蓋川人呼醃蛋為鹽蛋，恰與某之「延誕一諧音，故引起鬨堂也。　　鎭江金山寺，本名江天寺，以淸帝御碑江天一覽得名，因憶昔人筆記中，曾載淸帝書此碑時，竟將覽字誤寫為「覺」，書成後，自知有誤，但又不知覽字如何寫法，在衆臣環侍下，執筆躊躇，頗難下塲，某侍從詞臣甚機警，乃連稱御書佳極，跪請賜之，並伸掌作乞求狀，堂中則赫然一「覽」字也，淸帝乃乘機以誤書之紙賜之，而江天一　之碑，亦易紙書成矣。詩僧人指頭陀  復廬　　民初讀書南京紅紙廊，地近城西，每當休沐之暇，常與二三好友，登淸凉山掃葉樓，憑闌遠眺，覺南朝烟景，奔赴眼底，讀壁簡八指頭陀七古，自然天　，了無烟火氣。猶記其結句有「齊梁往事如敗葉，登樓欲掃俱無痕，……大千一髮了無際，笑看落月金盆翻」諸句，不禁心焉嚮往。展轉搜羅，得詩若干首，　皆其晚年之作，而於頭陀之身世，亦略得一二，蕭　靜坐，如懷故人。憶其先世為山谷後裔，宋時一遷茶陵，明末再遷湘潭之石潭。為農家子，七歲失母，父或他往，則與其弟寄食於鄰家，十一歲始就熟師讀論語，未終篇而父又歿，無所得食，乃為農家牧牛，猶帶書讀。塾師周雲帆憫其遇，收為弟子，乃執炊以酬恩。未幾，師又歿，聞有豪家覓人伴兒讀，欣然往就，至則供驅使，自讀輙遭呵叱，以與志違，復辭去學藝，鞕撻尤甚，絕而復　　數次。一日見籬間白桃花盛開，流連不忍去，忽風雨驟至，摧殘狼藉，不覺失聲大哭，遂投湘陰法華寺為僧，燃二指以供佛。後省舅氏於巴陵，登岳陽樓，友人分韻賦詩，已獨澄神趺坐，下視湖光，一碧萬頃，忽得「洞庭波送一佾來」句。歸而述於郭菊　，遂勸為詩，日益精進，然以讀書少，用力尤苦，或一字未愜，如負重累，至忘寢食，嘗有一詩歷敬年而始成。後徧遊吳越，住四明最久，與郡中諸名士遊，嘗作詩有「花下一壼酒」句，書至「壺」字，忘其點畫，遂書一酒壼於上。有徐酡仙者工書法，出紙强為作書，塗鴉旣竟，筆畫錯落，左右易位，如倒薤然，每讌集張之壁上，觀者無不絕倒。然其早年之作如題畫云：「一株兩株松，三個五個竹，　長寂寥，祗有雲來宿。」咏懷十首之一云：一去歲展先瑩，路　桑樹邊，村老向我言，此桑齊汝年，汝父昔在時，耕此桑下田，人牛今無迹，茲竟復誰憐？感此不能語，涕下如流泉。」不但心情醇　而意境亦殊深擊，故併及之。頭陀俗姓黄，名讀山，法名敬安，字寄　，雖　文字障，自落礙逕，然亦不失為一代詩佾。王湘綺評其高澹處絕似賈島姚合，比之寒山為工，消見其續作，乃骎骎欲過惠休，可謂知言矣。海紅樓詩錄  徐半夢　　狼烟烏嶂閉天驕，誓掃匈奴策未饒，大地山河收拾起，幾番風雨更能消！胡塵貂錦千人喪，楚炬宮庭一夜焦，秋月春花思往事，那堪回首問南朝！　　賓止　　細話淸茶每故常，偶逢賓止亦稱觴，時難親友疏相見，人老詩書讀便忘。文士但憂生活苦，頹年嬾為子孫忙，盤餐市近無兼味，同慨春江物　　登臨　　登臨極目仰天關，遠近蕭條指顧間，萬古文章傳海甸，一樓風雨對江山；寒花馥馥情方永，飛烏悠悠意自閒，獨抱艱難揮壯志，高歌浩蕩出塵寰。杭州的立夏  卜子　　杭州風俗，立夏前夜，兒意挨戶索米一碗，到第二天早晨　天煮立夏飯，盛以酒杯，分贈原來出米的人家。每杯飯上有白糖，紅綠絲，靑梅，櫻桃，據說吃了可以免疰夏。　　普通人家在立夏節早晨煮糯米飯作早點，或者在賣糕的小販那里買烏飯糕，烏飯糕祗有在立夏節那天可以買到，　淸　可口。　　　　事實上已經登市多日了，可是在立夏節那一天，人們仍　當牠是夏令時鮮蔬菜，非吃不可，因此這一天莧菜的價格特別被抬高了。　　國代大會有女代表　　　國初年之歷屆國會所無，此乃時代的進步，當然之事。即如各機開各學校之職員，　年亦只有男性，而今則女職員各處皆有、與男員一律辦公，並無何等「大驚小怪」之情形，而國代會塲乃右所謂「國大之花」，二國代之后一，不斷的起　，無論起於塲上人或旁聽人，是亦不可以已乎！昨　平津報紙所載電訊，又有所謂一中國之伊麗沙白」焉。是因去年英王之公主伊麗沙白舉行婚禮，豪華富麗，傾動世界，多人腦海有此貴族美女之印象，遂以加諸大會塲上來自邊疆而風致較為特別的女性。

<h3>Lapham to Arrive in China Early Next Month to Oversee US Aid Program; Our Government Expresses Willingness to Fully Cooperate</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 5th] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced today: Former San Francisco Mayor and shipping company president Roger Lapham has been appointed head of the Economic Cooperation Mission to China. Economic Cooperation Administrator Paul Hoffman, when making this announcement, said he was very pleased that Lapham accepted this position. Under the US Foreign Aid Act, China will receive $338 million in economic aid, to be administered by the Economic Cooperation Administration. Another $125 million is designated as a gift to China, as decided by President Truman. Economic Cooperation officials said today that the latter amount will not be within the scope of the Economic Cooperation Administration's management. Lapham declined to comment on the specifics of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China program, but said, "Anything we do that can develop China's production and help put China on a stable foundation is a big step in the right direction." He revealed that he would be traveling to Europe soon but would like to shorten his proposed three-month vacation so that he could return to Washington on May 24 to receive instructions on his new assignment. He said he expects to leave San Francisco for China in about ten days (i.e., early June). Lapham was born in New York City on December 6, 1883, and graduated from Harvard University in 1905. In the same year, he began working as a secretary at the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, becoming general manager of the company in 1925. From 1938 to 1943, he was chairman of the company's board of directors. In 1944, he was elected Mayor of San Francisco. During World War I, he served as a captain in the infantry. He also served as a member of the National Defense Mediation Board in 1941 and as a member of the National War Labor Board from 1942 to 1943. He is also a former president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lapham visited China last June with a group of American newspaper publishers and editors. (Photo: Roger Lapham)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 6th (Radio): Lapham is currently in New York. It is said that he has not yet had time to work on a plan. He will travel to London with his wife next Wednesday for a brief stay before starting work. He declined to comment further.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] It is learned that Lapham is expected to arrive in China around June 1.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to the United States Information Service: Before the new head of the US aid to China program, Roger Lapham, arrives in China, the work will be temporarily managed by Gilbert. Gilbert is currently the head of the United China Relief, and his mission will end on June 30. His management of the distribution of American relief food to the five major cities of China has won widespread praise. Gilbert's friends hope that after Lapham arrives in China early next month, he can continue to assist him.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, told United Press reporters today that the Chinese government welcomes the US government's appointment of someone with management experience like Roger Lapham to oversee aid to China and is willing to fully cooperate with him to complete his mission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Senate Specialist on Economic Adjustment Moore announced today: During the period when the newly appointed head of the aid to China delegation, Roger Lapham, is in Europe, the agency will first send an investigation team to China to study our country's current urgent needs and plan for the use of approximately $60 million in funds for the restoration of industries such as electricity, railways, and mining. The aid to China funds approved by Congress, excluding the $125 million for military purposes, are all under Lapham's supervision, including the shipment of food, oil, cotton, and other industrial raw materials. Of these, $38.8 million will be used for agricultural improvement, accounting for approximately 10% of the total. President Truman will work with Chairman Chiang to establish a Joint Rural Reconstruction Commission to guide rural development plans, composed of three American members and two Chinese members. Lapham's office is planned to be located in Shanghai or Nanjing. After analyzing the investigation team's report, he will propose methods for using the aid to China funds. At the same time, according to Lapham, he is very pleased to take on this new role. Although the aid to China funds are less than those for Europe, it is a step in the right direction.</p>

<h3>Our Policy Toward Japan Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Neither Advocating Revenge Nor Conniving</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reiterated our government's policy toward Japan in his report to the National Assembly on foreign policy on April 14, stating that our policy toward Japan has not changed since the end of the war. We do not advocate revenge, nor do we advocate conniving. In the military sphere, we advocate severity. The future peace treaty with Japan must ensure that Japan cannot engage in aggression again. In the economic sphere, we do not oppose allowing the Japanese people to be self-sufficient. As for the various proposals regarding the peace treaty with Japan reported in the press, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received them.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan to Convene Tomorrow Morning; Number of Legislators Registered Today May Meet the Legal Quorum; National Government Appoints Additional Preparatory Committee Members from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] As of 6:00 PM on the 6th, the number of legislators registered for the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution had reached 227. Di Ying, Liu Keshu, Wu Shangying, Zhang Jingyu, Aimeina, Deng Feihuang, An Futing, Wang Yisheng, Yuan Jijiong, Shi Jinmo, Zhao Pei, Ni Wenya, and others registered separately in the morning and afternoon. Furthermore, the preparatory office for the first session of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution held two discussion meetings on the morning of the 6th at 10:00 AM and in the evening at 9:00 PM to discuss various matters related to the convention. It was decided in the morning that Wu Tiecheng and Lou Tongsun would be responsible for contacting government agencies to request prompt allocation of funds in order to expedite preparations for accommodating legislators' meals, lodging, and transportation. After Wu and Lou spent the afternoon working on this, they presented a report at the evening meeting that satisfactory results had been achieved. It was generally stated that the total preparatory funds of 50 billion could be collected and used on the 7th. According to Lou Tongsun, now that enough legislators have registered to meet the quorum for the convention and the preparatory funds have been promptly allocated by the government, there are no longer any legal or technical issues preventing the meeting from taking place as scheduled on the 8th. The preparatory office has also decided to publish three announcements in the newspapers on the 8th: First, that the number of legislators registered by 6:00 PM on the evening of the 7th has legally met the quorum for the convention. Second, that in accordance with the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, the first session of the Legislative Yuan should convene on the seventh day (i.e., the 8th) after the closing of the first National Assembly. Third, that the meeting venue has been arranged by the preparatory office to be the National Assembly Hall, so the first legislators can go there to attend the meeting on the morning of the 8th. Lou said that after the Legislative Yuan convenes, it will first hold a preparatory meeting, the agenda of which will roughly be: (1) Elect a temporary chairman, (2) Discuss the method of electing the president and vice president of the Yuan, (3) Determine the rules of procedure (drafts will be drafted and submitted by several legislators), (4) Establish a committee to review the qualifications of legislators. The duration of the preparatory meeting will be determined by the Yuan itself, but it should be completed as soon as possible before the 20th, as according to Article 7 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the first president and vice president should take office within 20 days of being elected. Counting from the day the National Assembly sent the certificates of election on the 1st, the deadline is the 20th. The Yuan should complete the various items on the agenda of the preparatory meeting before this date so that the president and vice president can take office as soon as possible and promptly nominate candidates for premier to the Legislative Yuan for the reorganization of the government. Furthermore, the National Government has recently ordered the appointment of four additional members to the preparatory office for the first session of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution: Wang Shixian and Tang Rumei from the Democratic Socialist Party, and Liu Dongyan and Xia Taosheng from the Youth Party.</p>
<h3>Joint Statement by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The issue of the number of legislators from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties has currently reached a stalemate. The Youth Party representatives Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Chen Qitian visited Zhang Junmai at the headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party at 4:00 PM yesterday and, after discussing for more than two hours, decided to issue a joint declaration in response to Director Dong's statement yesterday, pointing out that the Kuomintang's distortion of facts using "legal arguments" is a betrayal of its promise. Members of the two parties will not attend the Legislative Yuan meeting to be held on the 8th. After the meeting, Zhang Junmai told reporters that the government's announcement of the number of seats had led to the current stalemate, and that the power to resolve the issue rests with the government, not with the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. We oppose resolving this issue by increasing the number of legislators. We have no intention of turning the Legislative Yuan meeting into a mass gathering. When asked by reporters about Lei Zhen's visit to Shanghai to invite him to Beijing, Zhang firmly stated that he has no intention of going to Beijing at present.</p>
<p>Zuo Shunsheng said: "After Lei Zhen was ordered to come to Shanghai, he maintained frequent contact with the two parties and kept in touch with relevant parties in the capital by long-distance telephone at any time. He had put forward suggestions for solving the problem, but did not mention the exact number of seats."</p>
<p>The full text of the joint statement by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties is as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, the Kuomintang authorities have repeatedly stated that the resolution of the current issue of legislators is based on the election results, with those who received the most votes being elected. Therefore, they cannot help the majority of legislators from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties who were not elected. This argument completely ignores the facts. The election of legislators this time was based on the government's distribution of ballots, and the ballots never reached the hands of the voters. Therefore, the so-called "more votes" or "fewer votes" is only the result of the government's distribution of ballots, not the result of the voters' election. Moreover, before the election, the Kuomintang authorities had already separately designated official candidates and alternate candidates for legislators, explaining that regardless of the number of votes, official candidates would remain official and alternate candidates would remain alternate. Now, they have reversed their previous statements and are distorting the facts using "legal arguments," which is a betrayal of their promise and a destruction of their credibility.</p>
<p>As for the statement that members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties participated in all election affairs, so the election process would not be biased, this is even further from the truth. The election offices at all levels only handled administrative matters, and the power to make all decisions rested with the Kuomintang and the government. For example, the election offices had to receive a notification from the Kuomintang authorities before they could issue certificates of election. The fact that the list of legislators was not decided by a meeting of the election offices but by a meeting of the central cadres of the Kuomintang is enough to illustrate the rest.</p>
<p>In short, what we are striving for is the establishment of a democratic political framework, which is based on the people's genuine voting and a genuine majority and minority. With this voting and this majority and minority, and with more than two parties forming the legislative body, there can be proper discussion and exchange of opposing views. The fact that the ballots in this election of legislators did not reach the hands of the people is known and seen by everyone. The Kuomintang authorities have created this unreasonable and illegal situation and excluded the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties. Therefore, the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties will not be able to participate in this one-party-dominated Legislative Yuan. They can only contribute to the country in their capacity as citizens, remaining in the opposition.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of Special Relief Donation in Shanghai Increased to 8.5 Trillion Yuan by Supervisory Committee; 333 Importers and Exporters Listed as Targets</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The quota for special relief donations in Shanghai was originally set at 5.5 trillion yuan. The Supervisory Committee decided at its meeting on the 6th to increase it by another 3 trillion yuan, bringing the total amount to 8.5 trillion yuan. At the regular meeting of the Supervisory Committee on the 6th, Supervisory Committee member Lu Qian spoke about the slow progress of the donation campaign, believing that the committee had made a lot of noise but accomplished little. Since the start of the meetings, not a single penny had been raised, which was useless, and even if the target was met in the future as expected, the currency value would have changed. Chairman Wang Yunwu then presented this opinion for discussion, and it was finally decided to increase the donation quota for each district in order to ensure practical use. Secondly, a discussion was held on the fact that Shanghai importers and exporters had made significant profits from exchanging foreign currency at official rates. It was decided that these merchants who had exchanged foreign currency for 10,000 gold yuan or more would be subject to the special relief donation. According to statistics, the list of such merchants in Shanghai reaches 333, and the Supervisory Committee decided to strengthen the process. The meeting also appointed Liu Butong and Jiang Yong to take this list to Shanghai to handle the matter.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The Navy announced: The cruiser "Aurora" and the destroyer "Mendip" will be transferred to the Chinese Navy on May 19 in Portsmouth.

<h3>Gu Yuquan Reports at the National Economic Commission; Rumors of Foreign Exchange Opening are False; Measures for Exchange of Silver Coins and Silver Categories Revised; Spring Silkworm Cocoon Purchase Price Formula Proposed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The National Economic Commission held its 39th meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. Chairman Wang Yunwu and Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuquan first reported on prices, saying that prices had been relatively stable for the past six weeks, but recently, the price of gold and US dollars had suddenly risen sharply due to rumors that foreign exchange would soon be opened, which was not the case. The following important proposals were then discussed:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the political proposal on how to strengthen the implementation of the public utility price adjustment formula, the city councils of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beiping had all expressed opinions on the price increase of public utilities. The Executive Yuan instructed the National Economic Commission to convene a review meeting with the ministries of Economy, Transportation, and Interior, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai municipal governments, to conduct research and propose five comprehensive opinions. It was resolved to pass the review opinions.</p>
<p>B. The Ministry of Finance requested the issuance of measures to prohibit the circulation of silver coins and silver categories. After discussion, it was deemed that prohibiting the circulation of silver coins was practically difficult and was not approved. The circulation of silver coins and silver categories is still permitted, but the measures for exchanging silver coins and silver categories for legal tender previously established by the Ministry of Finance should be revised. The exchange rate will be calculated and announced by the Central Bank with reference to the world silver price and the foreign exchange market price set by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee.</p>
<p>C. Of the quota for pharmaceuticals in the fifth and sixth quarters, a total of $400,000 was decided to be increased, with $400,000 per quarter and $800,000 for the two quarters. As for where to allocate the additional $400,000 from, it was decided to be studied by the Transportation Management Committee.</p>
<p>D. For the spring silkworm cocoon purchase price, a calculation formula has been proposed, based on the price of 44.77 yuan per dan of fresh silkworms in 1937. The purchase price of fresh silkworms at the end of April this year is as follows: 18 million yuan per city dan in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, 17 million yuan per city dan in the Hangzhou area, 11 million yuan per city dan in Chongqing, and 18 million yuan per city dan in Guangzhou. If the overall price index rises by 20%, the Four Joint Offices will adjust it according to the price index.</p>

<h3>Guanyun Speaker Wang Yousheng Transports Munitions to Bandits to Redeem Father, The Secret Leaked, He was Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Haizhou dispatch] Wang Xinzhi, the father of Wang Yousheng, the Speaker of the Guanyun County Provisional Council, was abducted by communist bandits when they captured Nanxinan Town in Guanyun County on October 17th last year, and detained in a village near Tanggou in Shuyang. The communist bandits demanded 1,500 silver dollars or 5,000 bullets from Wang Yousheng in exchange for his father, Wang Xinzhi. Wang Yousheng discussed the matter with his younger brother, Wang Yunsheng, and decided to buy bullets because 5,000 bullets could be purchased locally for 150 million yuan in local currency, while 1,500 silver dollars would be worth 45 million yuan in local currency. By April 24th, a certain number of bullets had been purchased. Wang Yousheng then used his younger brother Wang Yunsheng's position as the head of a Guannan Township Bao (self-defense unit) to transport two factory-made rifles, one Mauser pistol, and more than 2,800 bullets on two bicycles and a small cart, along with Wang Bitong, Hu Xuelun, Hu Xueru, and others, to the bandit area to redeem his father, Wang Xinzhi.

<p>[Reuters, London, 6th Dispatch] Sources in the British government said that Britain has received a last-minute appeal from the United States, requesting that Britain agree to extend the originally scheduled handover of the Palestine trusteeship on May 15 by ten days to May 25. The United States suggested that during this ten-day extension, a ten-day ceasefire be implemented in Palestine, so that a negotiating committee composed of Britain, France, Belgium, and the United States could conduct discussions with the Arab countries. This proposal was forwarded to the British government by Sir Alexander Cadogan, the chief British representative to the United Nations, at the request of the United States, but the British government has rejected the proposal. The case of ending the trusteeship on May 15 has already been passed by the British Parliament and officially became law after being approved by the King. If the British government agrees to an extension, it must be approved by Parliament again. Foreign Secretary Bevin also solemnly declared during Thursday's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons that Britain's decision to hand over the trusteeship on May 15 would not be changed.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Supports Western European Alliance; Believes War Can Be Avoided for Now; European Federation Plan Difficult to Implement at Present</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee stated in his speech on the second day of the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons today that he does not believe that war cannot be avoided, and he does not believe that any people in the world want war. But he also said that if war does break out, it will be because certain people take the opportunity. Attlee also said that Britain undoubtedly needs a Western European alliance, but Britain cannot only focus on one continent, Britain is interested in all continents in the world. Britain has tried its best to make the United Nations structure strong, and although there are various difficulties, he is not discouraged. The United Nations Charter has provisions for regional defense agreements. These agreements are not aggressive. Similar agreements already exist in Eastern Europe, and it is inevitable that Western Europe or the rest of the world should also have similar agreements. The British Commonwealth has generally agreed to the proposal for a Western European alliance, but the British government still wishes to convene a Commonwealth meeting as soon as possible to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] The foreign policy debate in the House of Commons discussed the motion for a European Union, jointly proposed by 191 members of parliament from various parties. The motion suggested that the first step is to establish a Western European Commission to coordinate social, economic, and defense policies, and then establish a Western European democratic federation, stipulating common citizenship and based on representative government. In answering this motion, Attlee said that he could not express agreement with each of the suggestions in it, because these suggestions cannot be implemented practically immediately, but he declared that the government would agree to take the establishment of a Western European alliance as its final goal for the further establishment of a world federation.</p>
<h3>Eden Freely Discusses Relations with the Soviet Union; The World Situation is Dangerous but Not Hopeless</h3>

He believes that only with strength as a backing can successful negotiations be conducted with the Soviet Union. He believes that the Soviet Union must understand that any tricks or sabotage are not enough to force the Western people to change their way of life. He said that when Western countries consider plans to increase their strength, they do not contain any intention of provocation or threat of war. Western countries have the sincerity to improve relations with the Soviet Union, but they refuse to seek improved relations through appeasement and weakness.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 6th Dispatch] Under-Secretary Mayhew pointed out in a speech ending the two-day foreign policy debate in the House of Commons on the 5th that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan is extremely urgent and has long exceeded the deadline that should have been set. He believes that not only Japan but even all countries in the Far East are eager to know its position, especially the level of Japanese industry, which is of the greatest concern to the general public. He said that the British government hopes that Britain and other powers will have the opportunity to carefully consider any major reforms that the United States wishes to implement regarding its economic policy towards Japan. He believes that the Allied countries must find a way to resolve all the problems after the war. Britain still insists on its previous request, that the peace conference with Japan must include representatives from all countries that have always participated in the war against Japan. Speaking of the Soviet Union's expansion policy, he said that we should not be satisfied with passive preventive measures, but must unite to promote our positive ideology. Mayhew continued, we all want to see Spain become a member of the international family, but Franco must step down first.</p>

<h3>Suggestions to Revise the United Nations Charter; Secretary of State Marshall and Ambassador Austin Express Opposition; Austin Also Advocates Military Aid to Friendly Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] US Ambassador to the United Nations Austin requested on the 5th that Congress not revise the United Nations Charter, but that it could strengthen the military status of countries friendly to the United States. Secretary of State Marshall and Austin both warned against attempting to revise the United Nations Charter. Austin told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that any attempt to change the form of the United Nations now would only result in destroying the world organization created for world peace. He declared that one way to strengthen this world organization is to militarily strengthen countries friendly to the United States. Austin and Secretary Marshall both said that some people have suggested reorganizing the United Nations, even if the Soviet Union does not participate if necessary. This is a mistake. Secretary Marshall opposes the proposal to abolish the veto power in the event of aggression. Austin also said that it is currently not possible for major powers to agree on revising the United Nations Charter. In addition to providing military assistance to friendly countries, Austin also suggested: (1) The European Recovery Program must be successfully completed; (2) The US military must be strengthened; (3) The "like-minded countries" should be united, such as the Rio Defense Treaty and the Western European Five-Nation Alliance.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Prices This Month to Not Rise by More Than 20 Percent; Mayor Invites Council and Committee Members to Discuss; Many Still Advocate Restoring Indirect Subsidy Policy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The issue of public utility prices for this city in May was discussed and decided by Mayor Wu at a council meeting yesterday. If the central government does not accept the City Council's request to restore subsidies, then the maximum price increase this month cannot exceed 20 percent. It is understood that the four items of water, electricity, gas, and telephone may be the first to implement price increases starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu invited members of the Council's Public Utilities Committee and the Public Utilities Investigation Committee yesterday to discuss the issue of public utility prices. Speaker Pan, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao, and more than 40 members of the two committees attended. Zhang Xiwei, the chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, also participated. The Mayor explained that the government has no right to force companies to operate at a loss. The current profit of public utilities is only 8% annual interest. As for the subsidy policy, it was implemented for three months last year, and the consequence was that the government issued more currency. If prices are forcibly frozen and the Mayor refuses to pay, the consequence will be that the companies cut off the supply of water and electricity, close down, or ask the government to take over, at which point the situation will be unimaginable. The city government's current solution is to try to reduce the factors that cause high public utility prices. After repeated negotiations with the National Bank regarding the foreign exchange needed for public utility materials, advance foreign exchange settlement for one month is no longer a problem, but the current foreign exchange rate has risen by 27% compared to the end of March. Regarding the coal problem, this city's public utilities need 45,900 tons per month. The Fuel Management Committee's allocation price for May has increased by 45% compared to the previous month, requiring 9.464 million yuan per ton. After repeated consultations with the Fuel Management Committee, 15,900 tons can be allocated and sold at a price of 7.321 million yuan per ton, another 15,000 tons will be allocated at 9.2 million yuan per ton, and the remaining 15,000 tons will be allocated at the new price for May. Therefore, the price of half of the fuel coal can be similar to that of last month. The workers' cost of living index has increased by 20.7%, and the employees' index has increased by 27%. If calculated according to this, the price increase of public utilities in May should be around 50%. After efforts, it can be reduced to about 25%. The city government has made its best efforts in this regard. Are there any other ways to reduce it further? I hope you can give more guidance, and the city government will do its best to implement them.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao then reported on the situation of contacting relevant parties regarding the materials needed by various public utility companies, and said that the companies have tried their best to tighten expenses where possible, and have also increased efficiency.</p>
<p>The councilors spoke enthusiastically, mostly advocating the restoration of the subsidy policy. Some also pointed out that the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal is not considering the overall livelihood of the people, but is for the purpose of profit. Tang Chengzong and Lu Yinchu believe that if a price increase is unavoidable, it should at least be halved from the 25% proposed by Mayor Wu, that is, an increase of 12.5%.</p>
<p>Speaker suggests two points. Then Speaker Pan rose to speak, expressing that if it is rigidly stipulated that public utility prices are not allowed to increase, various undesirable things may happen. He also stated two points: (1) Requesting that the Fuel Management Committee's coal price not increase, and that the allocation price of coal for public utilities not increase for at least three months. It would be better for the allocation price of other coal to increase a little more. Otherwise, the central government should be responsible for stimulating price increases for disregarding public opinion. In addition, the central government is requested to pre-settle foreign exchange for public utilities for three months. It would be better to settle a little less foreign exchange for other purposes. If the central government can adopt this, the factors that stimulate other price increases due to the increase in public utility prices will definitely be reduced or eliminated. (2) There are shortcomings in the public utility automatic adjustment method. It is hoped that the Council's Public Utilities Investigation Committee can expedite the investigation. Speaker Pan also accused that there are rumors that several public utility companies have a large amount of savings deposited in one or two commercial banks at low interest rates, and the banks use these funds to purchase foreign exchange on the black market. Both the companies and the banks should be responsible for this situation, and it is hoped that the authorities can conduct a detailed investigation.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu finally summarized the councilors' opinions. The percentage of public utility price increases in May will be based on the 20.7% increase in the cost of living index for workers in April, with a maximum of no more than 20%. The city government will negotiate with various companies. The meeting adjourned at around 7 p.m.</p>
<h3>Chennault and His Wife Return to Shanghai; to Hold Press Conference Today</h3>

However, the majority of Americans also strongly agree with and urge the achievement of curbing the development of communist forces.</p>

According to him, it was decided at the meeting of social administration heads of various provinces in Beijing that the allocation of refugee relief funds would be as follows: Anhui Province, assuming that 75,000 refugees should be assisted, with food expenses of 129.6 billion yuan and food transport expenses of 12.6 billion yuan.

This city, 25,000 people, food expenses of 45 billion yuan and transport expenses of 5.4 billion yuan. All these funds will be allocated from US relief supplies. As for the Sanmen Bay refugee agricultural reclamation plan, the Ministry of Social Affairs hopes that local people and charitable education groups will jointly initiate and sponsor it with relevant agricultural agencies, and the government will definitely do its best to assist. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is now starting to collect all relevant materials on Sanmen Bay agricultural reclamation, and plans to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections first.

<h3>Allotted Coal Ball Price: 120,000 Yuan Per Dan; Decision on Whether to Change to Allotting Coal Chunks to be Discussed Further</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] The price of allotted coal balls for industrial and professional workers this period has been decided. It is 120,000 yuan per dan, a doubling from the previous period. The People's Food Allocation Association advocated changing to allotting 50 jin of coal chunks (because 50% of the coal balls are coal slag, so 50 jin of coal chunks is equivalent to 100 jin of coal balls) to save about 30,000 yuan per dan in coal ball processing fees. However, because families are more accustomed to using coal balls than coal chunks, the Social Affairs Bureau will discuss the decision with the People's Allocation Association again this weekend, and it can be announced next week.</p>

<p>Restrictions on Remittances and Cash Transfers Between Shanghai and Guangzhou to be Lifted; Ministry of Finance Agrees; Crackdown on Gold and Currency Black Market to Address Root Causes and Symptoms</p>
<p>[United Credit Bureau News] The directors of the four gold control bureaus of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, Li Lixia, Shi Kuiling, Lin Chongyong, Gao Fang, etc., traveled together from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 3rd of this month to report on their work and offer sincere suggestions on current financial controls. The Ministry of Finance adopted all the suggestions made by Li and others based on their actual experiences in their respective regions. It is expected that the financial control policy will undergo a thorough improvement, and it will be gradually implemented soon. The four directors have completed their official duties in Nanjing. Except for Shi, who returned directly to Tianjin from Nanjing, Li, Lin, and Gao returned to Shanghai by train on the 6th. According to Li Lixia, who spoke to reporters, the group made several suggestions to the Ministry of Finance regarding financial control issues, and the Ministry is drafting measures based on their opinions. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to lift the restrictions on remittances and cash transfers between Shanghai and Guangzhou. The gold and currency black market has recently become rampant again, and capital flight is a major reason. Secondly, the reward system also has an impact. In addition to finding other ways to prevent capital flight, the bonus issue will revert to its original method. Part of the bonus will be transferred from the treasury to local relief efforts. Rewards to informants, executive agencies, and assisting agencies will be issued immediately after a case is solved. Using the money of speculators to provide local relief is the most ideal solution. Li believes that the implementation of this measure will make the crackdown on the gold and currency black market more effective. According to the original bonus method, informants receive 30%, executive and assisting agencies receive 35%, and the treasury receives 35%. If there is no informant, the treasury receives 50%, and the remaining 50% is given to the executive and assisting agencies. Now, the treasury portion is being transferred to local relief efforts. Li has consulted with Mayor Wu and decided to establish a bonus committee to be solely responsible for it. Regarding the crackdown on the gold and currency black market, Li said that short-term measures will continue as usual. The fundamental solution is being studied. Li believes that the current economic situation is indeed serious. The reasons for this are currency inflation and capital flight to Hong Kong. Today's fundamental problem is the Hong Kong issue. Because Hong Kong is a free market for our legal tender, the Hong Kong market must be controlled in order to control the domestic market. Having this back door is a major threat. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments are currently negotiating in Nanjing. The previous Sino-Hong Kong agreement only covered smuggling, and that agreement has been quite effective. This negotiation will be of great help to our economy, and it is rumored that a Sino-Hong Kong economic agreement will be signed to solve the problem of capital flight to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Yarn Prices Soar, Cotton Cloth Follows Suit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of cotton yarn rose again, with buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other groups constantly taking it, and the market atmosphere was unusually high. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was already up 6 million, and then it was raised to 284 million at the close due to the hype of the table gang, an increase of 14 million compared to the previous day. The new high price of 21-count Double Horse yarn was 199 million, and it was finally pulled back by 10 million compared to the previous day because the sales to customers were still sluggish. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts from 89 million to 14.5 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was very healthy, with buyers from Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and other groups. Although it was the period for the opening of fabrics for construction, the rising trend was still strong. The opening price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 5.57 million yuan, and then it was raised to 690,000 yuan due to the constant influx of northern gangs and the successive absorption of powerful factions. After a long period of hesitation by cloth merchants and retailers who sold, they heard that the yarn price and the stock market were rising, and cloth merchants and dyeing factories turned from selling to buying, jumping to a new high of 5.78 million at the end. It rose by 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day and was finally hyped to 5.8 million yuan. In addition, the prices of fine cloth, serge, straight tribute, twill, and other products rose in unison.</p>
<p>Also, the price of trumpet children's fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company was 5.38 million yuan, and there were many applicants. The approved purchase order was 200,000 yuan, but it was difficult to find, and the situation was quite profitable.</p>
<p>The opening time of the yarn market in this city has always been from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM every day. In order to adjust the appropriate trading time, the industry association announced yesterday that the opening time would be moved forward by one hour, from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM.</p>

<p>Free Talk An Example</p>
<p>Pingzhai</p>
<p>A small example can prove the seriousness of the refugee problem in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Every day, I take a rickshaw from my residence in Hongkou to my office in Huangpu District, and Zhapu Road Bridge is a must-pass. At this time last year, whenever the weather was cloudy and rainy and the road was muddy, I would always ask the rickshaw puller to stop at the bridge approach, get out and walk across the bridge myself, and then get back in the rickshaw and continue on. It seems to have been in the second half of last year that there were always a few children with pale faces waiting at the bridge approach, specializing in pushing rickshaws or pedicabs onto the bridge, but there were only three or four of them in total. After they pushed you to the top of the bridge, you would give them a five-hundred-yuan bill, and they would say thank you to you, very satisfied.</p>
<p>But things are very different lately. Pushing a car across the bridge seems to have become a very prosperous business. At the northern and southern approaches of each bridge over the Suzhou River, there is a big boss who specializes in managing the "pushers." He tightly organizes these "pushers," and every "pusher" has to hand over the money he gets to him, who then distributes it evenly, while he himself gets a cut without doing any work. I have witnessed a "big boss" distributing money many times. My impression is that the faces of the children pushing the cars (now adults are also participating) are still pale, while the "big boss" is well-dressed and shows no signs of malnutrition.</p>
<p>What about those who are unwilling to join these "pushing organizations"? They have no place to stand at the bridge approach (they will be beaten if they squeeze in), so they have to dump their labor at a low price. To win over customers, they would rather push a longer distance and take less money. As a result, the line of pushers waiting by the side of the road is gradually getting longer and longer. To take Zhapu Road Bridge as an example again, the line of pushers on the north side of the bridge has gradually extended from the bridge approach to Wuchang Road, and Tanggu Road has recently extended to Kunshan Road. As soon as your car arrives at the intersection of Zhapu Road and Kunshan Road, seven or eight people will rush to beg you to let them push your rickshaw. They are willing to push you across three horizontal roads and then push you onto the bridge, but the requested reward is the same as those who push the car from the bridge approach, only five thousand yuan: the price of a large pancake.</p>
<p>The competition is so fierce because there are more and more competitors; and the reason why there are more and more competitors is that there are more and more refugees coming to Shanghai.</p>
<p>I am very sympathetic to the refugees who maintain their lives by pushing rickshaws at the bridge approach. They exchange their own labor for pancakes to fill their stomachs, which can be said to be not ashamed of the sky and not ashamed of people. However, there are already so many competitors, and there is a tendency to continue to increase, so in the future, this pancake will become more and more difficult to get. That is to say, one or two strong men who wander to Shanghai may be able to survive by their own strength, but today's refugee problem has become a whole social problem, and it is not easy to solve.</p>
<p>This situation reminds me of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA), but the number of people in the country in urgent need of relief is far greater than when the NRRA was established, but the NRRA has already died. Moreover, even if the NRRA still exists today, I am afraid that it will be difficult to focus on the relief of these refugees. As far as I know, before the NRRA received the relief supplies from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), it first proposed a very specific and detailed post-disaster relief program. After this "program" was approved by UNRRA, UNRRA only issued the necessary materials listed in this "program" with a discount of 70-80%. Regarding the refugee part, this "program" originally had plans for repatriation and work relief, but these plans did not include the huge number of refugees in the past two years.</p>
<p>We think with common sense that the local government should be responsible for emergency relief, but what we hear and see is that a Mr. in the Social Affairs Bureau is promoting the incredibly clever "no-give-and-move," and when the refugees raise funds to purchase rickshaws and ask to live by pedaling rickshaws in the suburbs, the authorities of the Public Works Bureau refuse to issue licenses! We ordinary people are not surprised by the latter—the Public Works Bureau is busy studying and adjusting the prices of public utilities all day long, so naturally it is no wonder that they have no time to take care of the refugees.</p>
<p>However, there are more and more refugees on the streets of Shanghai, supporting the old and the young, and life is difficult and miserable. If this continues, we can see that those who are suffering from poverty and illness today will soon be reduced to ditches. The people are displaced, and the government cannot ignore it. Since the local government's response is like this, we have no choice but to look forward to the central government. At this time when the government is undergoing a new look, I hope that all the officials will take on the virtue of the heavens to cherish life and think of a way—do not learn from the example of the old men in the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Works Bureau!</p>
<p>Projection Psychology</p>
<p>Shi Yu</p>
<p>Just as the light of the moon is projected from the sun, the observation, thought, or evaluation of people towards each other is often projected from nothing and goes away. When you are happy, you feel that the subordinates are taking off their hats for you, the proprietress is flirting with you, and the birds are singing for you; when you are "low-key," you feel that the subordinates are "arguing" with you, the old lady is ridiculing you, and the birds are mourning for you. When your pocket is very light, you feel like people know you are a poor man. When you are missing half a button on your coat, or there is a small hole in the corner of your cheongsam, you will never go out again, as if everyone on the road will see that you are missing half a button or have a hole. The girl next door has no intention of falling flowers, but you think she has affection for you. As long as you fall in love with this girl, occasionally smile, you think she is smiling at you; occasionally glare, you think she is glaring at you. A famous "unrequited love" story says: A Viennese young woman fell in love with the famous violinist Paganini, she actually found that Paganini also fell in love with her, because every time he finished playing and bowed deeply to the audience, he always felt that he was smiling at her. Such examples can probably be found a dozen in the book "Dream of the Red Chamber." It is even more easy to pick up in the real environment, maybe you have had such experience.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to observe ourselves accurately. Even in terms of the simplest appearance, looking in the mirror, we see ourselves as beautiful when we are happy, and we see ourselves as unattractive when we are depressed. The observation of the inner heart is naturally even more difficult. Unless we can get rid of "emotion," don't even think about observing others accurately. As long as I dislike you a little bit, I will see too many of your disadvantages and too few of your advantages. If we look at Napoleon with the eyes of a hero, he is a hero; if we look at Napoleon with the eyes of a dwarf, he is a dwarf. Just like the fickle Sun Wukong, eighteen friends can see you as eighteen different appearances, because everyone uses the heart of a villain to shoot your gentleman's belly.</p>
<p>A housewife who likes to be greedy for petty gains expresses doubts about the electricity company's bill, wondering if the company authorities will charge an extra degree. A lonely friend defends himself in his diary: "It's not that I don't want to be close to others, it's that others don't want to be close to me." But this is the most reliable mirror: if you often feel that people are guessing at you, you are a suspicious person; if you often feel that people are jealous of you, you are a jealous person. If you often see the bright side of things, you are a happy person; if you often see the dark side of things, you are a sad person. If you feel that others are not friendly, it is mostly because you are not friendly first. Two friends often break up in the following circumstances: A and B have a disagreement over a trivial matter, A thinks that B has bad intentions towards him, and B thinks that A has bad intentions towards him. The two people project like this, and although both people are very kind, but as time goes on, the projection becomes more and more "unkind," and they have to cut off their seats.</p>
<p>The relationship between people is like this. The relationship between countries is no different. If the suspicion between countries exists for a long time, war will eventually break out one day. Historians tell us that in the 3,357 years from 1496 BC to 1861 AD, there were 3,130 years in war and only 227 years of peace. That is, on average, rest for one year every thirteen years, and then fight for another thirteen years, repeating like this. The human love of war is just like friends cutting off their seats, and it is mostly made by projection.</p>
<p>Siberian Wonders</p>
<p>Leng Leng</p>
<p>According to the research of archaeologists and geologists, tens of thousands of years ago, in the area connecting Europe and Asia, there was a kind of ancient giant elephant. They retreated northward in the same direction as the glaciers. When they arrived in Siberia, they could not move forward because there were too many swamps. After the final struggle, countless giant elephants finally sank into the extremely cold muddy swamps and froze to death in the ice and snow that did not melt all year round.</p>
<p>These giant elephants, although they have gone through tens of thousands of years, are still preserved very well in the natural large refrigerator. Not only the meat, fur, but also the undigested food in their stomachs is preserved intact; like bunches of moss, cattails, and wild grass, and even have not been chewed in the mouth.</p>
<p>Therefore, many Siberian farmers, after discovering these giant elephants, cut off large pieces of their red meat to feed their dogs, no different from taking food from the underground food warehouse.</p>
<p>The Ula grass that grows in Siberia has been spreading and dying continuously for thousands of years. The dead grass leaves rotten roots, which are laid on the ground in two layers, intertwined and twisted, and finally dissolve into mud, forming the surface layer. Because it is composed of grass roots, the soil on this surface layer is particularly soft, like a large piece of sponge tens of feet thick, hanging in the air loosely, both soft and elastic; when people walk on it, even places dozens of miles away will vibrate, as if dancing on a sofa bed.</p>

<p>More on Miswritten Characters</p>
<p>Yi Yun</p>
<p>I have previously listed stories of miswritten characters, which were published in this newspaper. Now I remember two more things, which are described separately as follows.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I took refuge in eastern Sichuan. The culture there was notoriously closed. A certain commissioner took the promotion of culture as his own responsibility and convened a conference on the birthday of Confucius. A certain local gentleman also took the stage to speak. His opening remark was "Today is the birthday of Confucius," but he misread the character "birthday" (誕) as "extend" (延). His disciples knew he was wrong and whispered, "Birthday..." The commissioner realized his mistake and hurriedly changed his statement to "Today is Confucius's extend..." As a result, the audience burst into laughter. This is because people in Sichuan call pickled eggs "salt eggs" (鹽蛋), which sounds exactly like the commissioner's "extend birthday" (延誕), so it caused a riot in the hall.</p>
<p>Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang was originally named Jiangtian Temple, named after the Qing Emperor's imperial stele "Jiangtian Yilan" (江天一覽). It is recalled that in the notes of ancient people, it was recorded that when the Qing Emperor wrote this stele, he actually mistakenly wrote the character "view" (覽) as "sense" (覺). After writing it, he knew that it was wrong, but he did not know how to write the character "view." Surrounded by ministers, he hesitated to write, which was quite difficult to deal with. A certain attendant was very clever and repeatedly praised the imperial writing, knelt down and asked to be given it, and stretched out his palm in a begging gesture, with the character "view" (覽) clearly written in the hall. The Qing Emperor took the opportunity to give him the wrongly written paper, and the stele of "Jiangtian Yi Lan" (江天一覽) was rewritten.</p>
<p>Poet Monk Pointing Finger Monk</p>
<p>Fu Lu</p>
<p>When I was studying at Nanjing Hongzhi Lane in the early years of the Republic of China, it was close to the west of the city. Whenever I had a day off, I often climbed Qingliang Mountain and Sweeping Leaf Tower with two or three close friends. Looking into the distance, I felt that the scenery of the Southern Dynasties rushed to the bottom of my eyes. Reading the seven-character ancient poem by the Eight-Finger Monk on the wall, it was natural and free of worldliness. I still remember that the concluding sentence had lines such as "The past events of Qi and Liang are like fallen leaves, climbing the tower to sweep them all without a trace... The vastness of the universe is boundless, laughing at the moon falling and the golden basin turning." I couldn't help but yearn for it. After searching and collecting, I obtained several poems, all of which were his late works, and I also learned a little about the life of the monk. Quietly sitting in meditation, as if thinking of an old friend. I remember that his ancestors were descendants of Shangu, and one migrated to Chaling in the Song Dynasty, and another migrated to Shitan in Xiangtan at the end of the Ming Dynasty. He was born into a farmer's family, lost his mother at the age of seven, and his father went elsewhere, so he and his younger brother were supported by the neighbors. At the age of eleven, he began to study the Analects with a teacher, but before finishing the book, his father died again, and he had nothing to eat, so he grazed cattle for the farmers, still carrying a book to read. The teacher Zhou Yunfan pitied his fate and took him as a disciple, so he cooked to repay his kindness. Before long, the teacher died again. He heard that a wealthy family was looking for someone to accompany their child to read, and he gladly went to join them. When he arrived, he was provided for errands, and he was often scolded when he tried to read, which was contrary to his wishes, so he resigned and learned art. He was whipped and beaten even more severely, and broke off and rejoined several times. One day, he saw white peach blossoms blooming in the fence, lingering and reluctant to leave. Suddenly, a storm came and devastated them, and he couldn't help but cry out loud, so he became a monk at Fahua Temple in Xiangyin and burned two fingers to worship the Buddha. Later, he visited his uncle in Baling and climbed Yueyang Tower. A friend divided the rhymes and composed poems, and he sat in meditation alone, looking down at the lake, a vast expanse of blue. Suddenly, he obtained the line "The waves of Dongting send a group of musicians." When he returned and told Guo Ju, he was persuaded to write poetry, and he became more and more diligent. However, because he had little reading, he worked especially hard. If a word was not satisfactory, he felt as if he was carrying a heavy burden, to the point of forgetting sleep and food. He once had a poem that took several years to complete. Later, he traveled all over Wu and Yue, and lived in Siming for the longest time, and traveled with the famous scholars in the county. He once wrote a poem with the line "A pot of wine under the flowers." When he wrote the character "pot" (壺), he forgot its strokes, so he drew a wine pot on it. Xu Tuoxian, who was good at calligraphy, took out paper and forced him to write. After scribbling, the strokes were staggered, and the left and right were reversed, like inverted leeks. Every time there was a banquet, he would hang it on the wall, and the viewers would burst into laughter. However, his early works, such as the painting inscription, said: "One or two pine trees, three or five bamboos, grow long and desolate, only clouds come to stay." One of the ten poems in "Expressing My Feelings" said: "Last year, I went to repair my ancestors' graves, the road passed by the mulberry trees, the villagers said to me, this mulberry tree is as old as you, your father used to plow the fields under this mulberry tree, people and cattle are now gone, who do you pity now? I was speechless with emotion, and tears flowed like a spring." Not only is the mood mellow and the artistic conception is also very profound, so I have included it. The monk's secular surname was Huang, his given name was Dushan, his Dharma name was Jing'an, and his courtesy name was Jiyu. Although he was obstructed by words and fell into the path of obstacles, he was still a generation of poets. Wang Xiangqi commented that his lofty and indifferent place was very similar to Jia Dao and Yao He, and he was more skillful than Hanshan. It can be seen that his continued works are gradually surpassing Hui Xiu, which can be said to be a knowledgeable statement.</p>

<h3>Giving Serious Consideration to the Korean Crisis</h3>
<p>The political parties of both North and South Korea have already held a joint conference in Pyongyang, unanimously expressing their opposition to a separate election in South Korea and demanding the simultaneous withdrawal of troops from Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the North Korean People's Assembly has also passed a "Constitution of the Korean Democratic People's Republic" in Seoul. Thus, the Korean issue, which had been in a stalemate, seems to have reached the stage of a showdown. According to Lieutenant General Hodge, the commander of the US occupation forces, the United States is determined not to recognize this constitution and is unwilling to negotiate with North Korea. At the same time, he also flatly rejected the Pyongyang conference's request for the withdrawal of US troops from Korea. His reasoning is: "If the US troops withdraw, the North Korean communist army and its power-hungry partisans and puppets will inevitably try to control South Korea. In this way, Korea would become one of the Soviet satellite states." Since the attitude of the United States is so clear and firm, it is naturally impossible to make the United States give in. It is expected that the separate election in South Korea on May 10th will inevitably be carried out, and there is absolutely no room for change.</p>
<p>Due to the stationing of American and Soviet troops in the North and South of Korea, the 38th parallel has become almost the border between North and South Korea. For two and a half years, the opposition and conflict between North and South Korea have not only shown no hope of easing, but have intensified and become increasingly acute. This has made people worried that Korea will become the "Greece of the East" and may become the fuse for a third world war. Therefore, not only do the Korean people yearn for the unification, independence, and liberation of their motherland, but also the United States hopes to compromise with the Soviet Union so that the Korean issue can find a reasonable solution. However, for the past two years, the stalemate on the Korean issue has remained unresolved, forcing the United States to advocate a separate election in South Korea. The United Nations Korean Commission then decided to hold a vote on May 10th. This approach, from the American point of view, can indeed be regarded as a method of last resort. However, from the perspective of the Korean people, if South Korea holds a separate election, the consequence will inevitably be the establishment of a divided South Korean government, and the desire for reunification between the North and South will not be realized. Therefore, all Korean political parties and social groups, except for Syngman Rhee's Democratic Party, oppose the American approach of holding separate elections in South Korea. Even Mr. Kim Gu, the leader of the Korean right wing, generously stated: "If the Pyongyang conference fails, I will commit seppuku at the demarcation line between the US and Soviet occupation zones at the 38th parallel." The Soviet Union, for its part, believes that it can take advantage of the Korean people's desire for unification to undermine the American plan for a separate election in South Korea. Therefore, it has done everything possible to encourage the Pyongyang conference and the North Korean People's Assembly. Therefore, on the surface, the resolutions of the Pyongyang conference and the passage of the constitution by the North Korean People's Assembly can indeed be seen as a victory for the Korean people. However, in reality, the so-called Korean issue is nothing more than a link in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, and it still has no benefit for the fate of the Korean people themselves.</p>
<p>The development of the Korean situation to this point cannot but be said to be a failure of the US policy toward Korea, and its mistakes have caused today's bad results. Standing in the position of a third party, calmly and quietly studying the Korean issue, it is not difficult to find the errors in the US policy toward Korea.</p>
<p>First, the Korean people, under the oppression of Japanese imperialism, have long been awakened and demand not only national independence and liberation but also national unity and prosperity. During World War II, Korean patriots launched national liberation movements at home and abroad. The great powers at the Cairo and Potsdam conferences also all allowed Korea to be independent in a "due course." When Japan surrendered, the Korean people celebrated the arrival of the days of liberation and independence, but unexpectedly, as a result of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, not only was the desire for Korean independence not realized, but Korea was still occupied by American and Soviet troops, with the 38th parallel as the dividing line, and it was impossible to seek reunification between the North and South. How can the Korean people not be disappointed? Not heartbroken? Therefore, the United States does not understand the wishes of the Korean people, does not fulfill its past promises to allow Korean independence, does not help the Korean people to achieve independence and unity, but instead adopts a policy of splitting Korea; this is indeed a major mistake in the US policy toward Korea.</p>
<p>Second, the division of North and South Korea is also a fatal blow to the Korean economy because South Korea is the agricultural area of Korea, and North Korea is the industrial area of Korea. Only when the North and South are unified, cooperate with each other, and exchange what they have, can the Korean economy be revived. Otherwise, the livelihood of the Korean people cannot be solved. Therefore, the Korean people yearn for the unification of the North and South, in addition to political factors, there are also economic factors. However, the US policy toward Korea neither respects the wishes of the Korean people nor takes into account the economic conditions of Korea, how can it win the support of the Korean people! Although we do not know the general situation of the actions taken by the Soviet Union in North Korea, the Soviet Union is always encouraging the Korean people to strive for unity and solidarity, and is always trying to improve the economic life of the Korean people. Compared with the two, the United States will naturally only fail in Korea.</p>
<p>Third, the current US policy of supporting the revival of Japan is also a major reason why the US military rule in South Korea has lost popular support. Korean residents in Japan are still being abused and oppressed by the Japanese government. In the eyes of the Korean people, this is always the result of the US supporting Japan and suppressing Korea. At the same time, seeing Japan's increasingly prosperous revival makes the Korean people even more afraid of being re-ruled by Japan. Moreover, in South Korea, most of the police who maintain order are police from the Japanese era, and the psychology of hostility still exists, thus creating a psychology of anti-Japanese and anti-American sentiment among the Korean people. Therefore, riots continue to occur in South Korea, and the reason lies in this.</p>
<p>The above is worth deep reflection by the US authorities. It is now time for the United States to change its policy toward Korea. If the United States does not start by winning over the hearts and minds of the Korean people and insists on going its own way, the separate election in South Korea on May 10th may cause unexpected waves and lead to the explosion of the Eastern powder keg! We hope that the US government and the public can face up to the Korean crisis.</p>

<h3>Suspected Fraud Case in Guangzhou Involving Huge Sums; Song Zewen Orders a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou, this newspaper, 6th] The suspected fraud case involving huge sums of money by the New Changsha Industrial Company related to the Guangzhou branch of the Hunan Provincial Bank has continued to develop significantly recently. Director Song Ziwen of the Executive Headquarters has ordered the Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation. According to senior officials of the Financial Management Bureau in charge of the investigation, the responsibility problem seems to lie with Hu Nianqun, the deputy manager of the branch, and Hou Yumin, the manager. However, more than 50 creditors believe that all loans are guaranteed by the Guangzhou branch of the Hunan Bank and cannot be regarded as having no responsibility. They have now organized a debt group to negotiate with the bank. Among the creditors are wealthy merchants, concubines of others, university professors waiting to study abroad, and widows who rely on loans to make a living. When negotiating with the Hunan branch, the sound of crying was deafening. What is even more surprising is that Hou Yumin and Hu Nianqun, the two people involved in the case, are also listed on the list of creditors. In addition, 8,040 dan of salt stored in Yuya after the company went bankrupt has been sealed up.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Receives Reporters and Declares Progress in Guangdong Province; University Students Will Be Recruited in the Summer to Serve as Administrative Cadres</h3>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou, this newspaper, 6th] Chairman Song Ziwen received reporters today and declared: Guangdong Province has indeed made significant progress in politics recently. He pointed out the facts as follows: (1) The source of Guangdong Province's tax revenue, Shatian, has recently been rectified and is ready. The income will change afterwards. (2) The suppression of smoking and gambling throughout the province has achieved partial results. A total of 38 counties and more than 10,000 mu of land have been removed from the opium planting areas. The areas where the Communist bandits protect opium planting are also being wiped out. Local county magistrates have been held responsible for curbing the gambling trend. (3) To clean up the administration, 48 county magistrates have been replaced since October last year, 10 people have been detained for cases, 9 people have been sent to the court for investigation, and 1 person has been wanted. In addition, many outstanding university students will be recruited and trained this summer to serve as administrative cadres. (4) The highway from Pingshi to Nanling Coal Mine in Guangdong Province has been built, and 3,000 tons of coal can be supplied from this month, and it can be increased every month, so there is no need to worry in the future.
