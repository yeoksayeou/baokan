<p>〔美經合署十四日訊〕美經合署調查團團長司待立門，於十三日華盛頓記者招待會中，表三千五百萬美元經合署工業配件方案項下，助我經濟復興之十項新計劃。刻已暫定分配與各計劃者，計一七，八五〇，〇〇〇美元。（首批撥款四百四十萬元九月一在滬宣布）。此項計劃，與中國之工業增產及經濟彷定，均極有關係。</p>
<p>上述總數之大部，指定作改進中國四大鐵路之用。計　華南運輸命脈之粵漢鐵路配得五百萬美元，連絡揚子流域及粵漢路之浙贛鐵路得二百五十萬美元，銜接平津及運輸開灤煤斤之平津鐵路得一百五十萬美元，及環繞台西之台灣鐵路得一百五十萬美元。</p>
<p>司徒立門同時發五項電力新計劃，其中電鉅者中華南京小型電廠，共得二百五十萬美元。北平，計得二百五十萬美元。其次資委會所辦之華中華南各小型電廠，共得二百五十萬美元。北平。天津。太原。瀋陽及青島各電廠，共得二百萬美元（包括前次發表廢與平津電力網之款項）漢口電廠三十萬元，及重慶電廠二十五萬元。司徒氏所發表之第十項計劃，爲供給中國海關業滅走私用之配件及設備，計一百萬美元。司徒氏强調工業配件計劃，對於中國之全部重要性謂將使中國之毎一階層人民得到裨益。司徒氏又稱：該工業建設及配件計劃，將儘量利用「聯總」供給中國之材料。又美國軍用剩餘物資，亦將儘可能加以利用。並謂：「茲正準備一切步　，務使經合署供給之材料與配備均能在採辦·運輸·與抵華後之裝置及有效之使用上，得到保證。吾人深信，此等物件決不致擱置倉庫，或因缺乏適當之準備，金融上之調度或監督，以致流入非生產之途」。</p>
<p>司徒氏與嚴家淦定於一週內偕返中國，以便從事於實施工業建設與配件計劃之最後步驟。截至目前止，工業配件撥款之業已宣布者，總計逹二二，二五〇，〇〇〇美元。其餘之一二，七五〇，〇〇〇美元，將用於其他配件，並可能的物資增値與其他不虞之需。經合署之三千五百萬美元元工業建設計劃（三千五百萬美元業已發作配件用途，其同額款項則用於工業建設），頃在與中國政府討論中。經合署希望司徒氏與嚴氏回華後，雙方即能獲致協議。</p>
<p>二批外棉易紗標準決定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美援運用委員會棉花小組會，昨下午三時起舉行會議。出席者有王念祖，陳述曾，潘蕳良，榮一心，王子健，劉建華，宋立峯，劉文騰，戴德，魏特等，顧毓　主席。討論結果，決定第二批外棉易紗標準，計廿支標凖紗易百分之七米特林棉花五八三·五磅。該案一俟美援及經合分　聯席會通過後，卽付實施。二批棉花俟一批棉花配竣後，卽接續發配。又該會第一批外棉六九五二八包，分配比例如次：計紡建公司二八三一八包，六區公會（蘇浙皖京滬〕二九八九四包，七區公會（天津〕一五五七包，九區公會（靑島）五五二包，英商怡和一八九包，英商綸昌四七〇包，其他各廠七一九八包。第二批外棉約共十九萬包，亦將按各廠開工錠數，比例分配。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國民黨紀念週上　俞鴻鈞出席報告　美援運用工作　以自力更生為基礎 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕行政院美援運用委員會副主委兪鴻鈞，十三日晨在國民黨中央紀念週報告美援運用工作，原詞如下：</p>
<p>在未報吿美援運用之先，我來先報吿美援運用宗旨：美援運用是根據中美雙方，於本年七月三日簽訂的「中華民國政府與美利合衆國政府關於經濟援助之協定」，卽所謂雙邊協定來執行的。美國根據他的國策，對於戰後各個自助自立的國家，予以經濟上的援助，於是通過了對歐亞各國的經濟援助法案，根據這個法案才產生了中美間的變邊協定協定約首，簡明而扼要地說明。因爲，我國政府，決心推行自助計劃，以穩定國內經濟情况，而美國政府亦依照其一九四八年援華法案之規定，對中國政府及人民予以經濟援助，所以雙方才議定條款推行這一國際間的友好政策。</p>
<p>因此，美援運用，可說是以自力更生爲基礎，而以美援來配合，促進其成功的。我們善用美援，當然更容易自力更生，而美援的運用，一本自力更生的精神，整個的美援，由自力更生而來，更必須以自力更生的精神去做，這是此次美國對華經濟援助的意義，與普通國際間的互惠條約，或其他目的的條約，有听不同之處。</p>
<p>美援運用委員會同人，秉承翁主任委員之命，根據上述原則，運用美援，還要配合當前國內財政經濟情况，針對要點，分別緩急，以求述用之妥善。運用美援之目的有三：（一）穩定經濟以求國內收支之平衡，（二）節省外匯基金之消耗以求國際收支之平衡，（三）促進農工生產以奠定經濟復興之基礎。大要霄之，出售美援物資是收縮通貨平衡國內收支的辦法；物資運蓋是節省外匯平衡國際收支的辦法；擬定建設方案，輔助農工發展，是促進生產復興經濟的辦法。以上辦法，有的治本作百年大計的打算，有的治標，針對目前急要問題，求得解決　。上述的（一）（二）兩項，近於治標，（三）項近於治本，在目前說來，是治標急於治本，但就其性質，則當然治本重於治標，因此分配美援，大部用於穩定當前經濟，而鼓勵生產工作，亦在兼籌並顧之中，使渡過難關，奠定基礎，以實現自助自立，自力更生的原則</p>
<p>美遙遠物資狀況</p>
<p>現在分別將美援物資部份狀况扼要報吿：</p>
<p>協定重要內容中美經濟援助協定全文，共十二條，內容相當廣泛茲擇其最關重要者陳述於下：（甲）我國承允推行各項自助計劃，如經濟資源之有效利用，促進農業生產之發展，改進產銷，穩定幣制財政，及預算等事項，以與美援相配合，俾經濟情况，獲得最大之改善。（乙）供給之美援物資，應由中美兩國商定，以加工及分配。（丙）由我國政府在中央銀行，開立特別賬戶，照美方，在贈與基礎上所供給之物資等美金數額，折合國幣，如數撥存，以供（一）美方執行美援之行政費用，（二）農村復興經費，（三）救濟物資及包裹之國內運費，（四）謀幣制及財政穩定而採取之凍結，（五）鼓勵生產及開發新富源而作之支出，（六）推行方案或計劃之支出，（七）中美救濟協定案，尙未完成之救濟及工振方案之支出等項之用。截至一九四九年四月三日，如有結餘則由兩國政府另訂支用辦法。（丁）對美國資源中缺乏，而爲我國所產之物資，由我國依照兩國政府所商定之買賣交換易貨，或其他方式，予以移轉便利。</p>
<p>依照協定，美方在贈與基礎上，以供給之物資在美方供給之時，卽由我國照美金成本折合國幣存入中央銀行特別賬戶，不啻政府以國幣購入物資，是以如果物資售價不能彌補成本原價，而撥入特別賬戶之款，又未能予以儘量之凍結，則各項支用需款鉅億，或竟轉將增加國家之負祖，此點最關重要，必須特予重視，隨時注意緊縮，以符穩定財政經濟之本旨。</p>
<p>專款運用期限</p>
<p>美國此對對華援助數額，經濟部份爲二億七千五百萬美元，其中贈與者計二億一千五百萬美元，貸給者計六千萬美元，贈與部份，商定分配狀况如次：（一）糧食七千萬美元，（二）棉花七千萬美元，（三）油料五千萬美元，（四）肥料一千三百八十萬美元，（五）式業補充器材一千萬美元，（六）美方行政費用一百廿萬美元。以上共計二億一千五百萬美元，貸給部份，計工業建設計劃一項六千萬美元。</p>
<p>上述物資及建設計劃專款運用期限，據法律規定，自本年四月起，至明年三月止，爲期一年，爲便利辦理起見，將撥款時間，分爲四期，毎期三個月。（下轉第二版）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕前行政院院長張羣氏，於昨日下午一時廿分，自東京乘西北航空公司班機飛抵滬，張夫人及顧問邵毓麟同來。張氏下機後卽爲歡迎之羣衆所包圍，在塲迎候之蔣經國，方治，陳國廉，張嘉鑄等，均紛紛趨前握手言歡。張氏昨衣藏靑色條花呢西服，旅日三週，膚色顯然較那黝黑，惟神采奕弈，尙無倦容。當記者　趨前請其發表談話時，渠笑謂：談話在日本時已發表不少，今以行色匆忙，並無其他談話，某記者以對日印日及美國扶日等問題相詢，渠答：今日對一切問題，怒均不能作答。本人卽有談話，亦將公開發表，決不向任何記者單獨發表。言畢卽偕夫人與張嘉籌等同車馳離機塲。</p>
<p>據接近張氏之某氏稱：張氏此次在滬約有一二日之勾留，卽將晋京向中樞報吿訪日經過。對新聞界之談話，可能在南京發表。</p>

<p>〔本報甫京十三日電〕立院十三日上午九時舉行第二次秘密院會，繼續質詢財經緊急措施，計出席委員三百餘人。翁文灝·王震五·兪鴻鈞·陳啓天·孫越崎及農次謝澄宇均列席。孫院長力疾出席主持，發言委員有劉友琛·劉明揚·侯紹文·陳紹賢·鄭震宇·武誓彭·楊寳琳·黃紹茲（書面代宣讚），鄒樹文·沈重宇·周雍能·王德箴·董微等多人，午十二時許散會，下午三時續會，出席委員二百餘人，孫院長因病吿假，公推王啓江主席，委員段劍岷·楊大乾·皮德中·連謀·葉道淵·苗啓平·李鈺·張這渠等相繼發言，各委員質詢中，頗多寳貴意見，對財部洩露機密案亦有提及，至下午五時四十分，除已改用書面者外，未及發言者尙有數十人，經主席徵求各委負意見，一致通過尙未發會者改用書面質詢。</p>
<h3 id="c6">王雲五答覆 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>旋由王財長答覆，王氏首對各委員寳貴意見表示謝意，並稱：「本人不僅應以口頭及在短期內以書面分別答覆，並決以事實答覆諸位」。此語當卽博得「碰頭好」之掌聲。旋續稱：下半年預算收支可以相抵，至金圓券發行廿億，與廿六年戰前中央發行法幣十六億及各地省幣四億共達廿億相較，數宇顯然不多，本年下半年六個月之預算，所以在七八兩月中用去九分之八渚，係依照總預算案施行條例第九條之規定辦理，今後幣値穩定，通貨流通速率减低，物價自可穩定，預算卽可平衡。關於鹽稅加價，王氏稱：政府甚表抱歉，惟爲平衡預算，故依照總預算案施行條例第十條之規定，按照物價指數予以調整，政府絕非有意忽視立院決議。至公敎人員待遇，政府爲求預算收支平衡，本擬裁冗員後調整，惟又恐造成失業問題，但目前　不增加，將來仍有增加之可能。關於財政部高級職員洩露機冗長案，王氏一再「坦白說明」，僅係「用人不愼」，渠本人事前確　防護機密之責，事後亦親自協助拘辦。王氏最後並稱：本人個人之云留，完全以國家利益為重，如果國家不需要本人担任財長。本人立卽引退，如仍需要，　惟有　力爲之。（鼓掌）。</p>
<h3 id="c7">俞鴻鈞答覆 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>

<h3 id="c8">翁文灝答覆 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>最後由翁院長答覆，首說明財部職員洩露機密案處理經琮，繼說明數點：（一）五大都市配糧制度，係繼續前政院旣定政策辦理，雖有困難處，但優點甚多，有繼續價値。（二）敵僞產業之處理，政府正積極整頓，卽可出售，以充裕國庫。（三）國內外外匯及國外資產，人民可以公開檢舉，政府且極歡迎此種協助。（四）金銀外匯收購到期（九月三十日）卽截止，屆時金圓劵信用將更增强，至下午六時半，翁氏答覆亦在掌聲中結束，主席當宣吿散會。</p>

<h3 id="c18">取締囤積的補充要點 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>關於取締囤積居奇的法令，凡有三種：（一）是非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇，於三十六年二月間奉令重行適用的：（二）是上項辦法之實施注意事項，於本年一月間，由經濟部擬訂頒行的；（三）是上項辦法之補充要點，日前方經政務會議通過，由行政院令經濟部通飭施行。</p>
<p>所謂補充辦法共七條，其全文已見十一日的本報。其補充之點凡四：</p>
<p>（一）屬於本業商人營業需要之物品，不得超過每年需要量四分之一，（有季節性者除外）；</p>
<p>（二）指定地點，實施倉庫檢査；</p>
<p>（三）法幣一千元以下之罰餒，改爲金元一千元以下之罰鍰；</p>
<p>（四）執行是項法令之主管機關，在院轄市及省會所在地爲社會局或社會處外，加「會同治安及警察機關辦理」一語。</p>
<p>以上二三四各點，皆係適應事實的當然措置，其較爲新頴的爲第一點，卽有季節性的存貨，得於每年營業的需要限額中予以除外，可稱法令商情，雙方兼顧，自是商人所樂聞。</p>
<p>這裏，還要向當局補充說明的：（一）是過時貨，卽花樣，顏色，和品種等，均已不合時尙，無法及時推銷者，這在花樣翻新的大都市中，其情形尤爲顯著。（二）爲滯銷貨，如今之水泥，機器等，存貨累積，皆有無法出淸之苦。（三）爲冷門貨，如書籍，儀器等，其銷路如何，俱非片面推動所能如願者。所以季節性這個但書，我們認爲範圍或尙嫌狹小。</p>
<p>有人以爲這項補充要點，原所以補充日用重要物品之囤積取締，其範圍祇限於糧食，服用。燃料，日用品，及其他經濟部指定之日用重要物品，與其他貨物無關。其適用時，自不致如理想中之困雖。執行時果能照此解釋，我們亦認爲十分允當。</p>
<p>補充要點第二項，對於工廠商號所存儲之成品及貨品，雖規定應儘量供銷，並不得超過限價，但於工廠所存之原料，在數量上，却未加以何等限制，僅令於造送月報時，隨同出產量，購貨，銷貨數，及存貨量（成品原料及重要物料），一併報査，這也是値得稱道之一事。因爲原料是工廠再生產的基礎，其積備愈豊，則生產愈有把握，今把它提出在應行取締的囤積範圍以外，不能不說是十分明智的舉動。但於非商人或非本業商人的囤積，我們仍希望要依法嚴加取締，以期减輕成本，增加供應。照過去的情形看來，業外人壟斷原料，濫踢皮球，顯然是抬高物價與壓迫廠商的一個重要因素！而廠方本身自已積儲原料以供生產之需者，應不在取締之列。</p>
<p>取締辦法所指囤積行爲，係以大量購存爲條件之一，但何等數目方稱大量，此疑問，直至注意事項頒佈後，方有明文解釋，卽：「凡超過全年需要量五分之一至三分之一者爲大量」，而此次所頒補充要點第一項，却又定爲「不得超過每年需要量四分之一」，前後殊不相符。好得同條下段，尙有「其應行取締之限度，得由地方主管官署，就上列標準，…斟酌供需情形，隨時核定」的規定。在執行時，自應斟酌情形，量予變通，勿拘執四分之一的標準，以求推行盡利。</p>
<p>所謂取締辦法和注意事項，也不是沒有缺點的，例如；居奇行爲，原以抬價超過合法利潤爲條件，（取締辦法第三條）但各貨的合法利潤，並不一致，究應如何分別規定，似不是一件輕易的工作。又應行限價出售之物品，到限未能出售時，得由管理物資或平價供銷機關。以公平價格收買之（同辦法第十二條）。直至今日，我們也還沒有看見這項譽理物資或平價供銷機關能够配合得起來。這雖是執行問題，不是立法問題，但事實上如果辦不通，似不如直捷地予以修正之爲愈。</p>
<p>關於各項經濟法令，以頒行時環境的關係，不免零星雜湊，隨時應付，並沒有一貫的方針，以致重複，矛盾之處不一而足，如上文所舉各點，還是比較輕微的問題。我們很希望主管部：對於整理法令這一項工作，還要多多地予以注意：因爲一切政策的推行，還是要靠法律爲之凖繩，如果法規有了缺點漏洞，勢必令執行的人戚到不少困難。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕關於中央銀行昆明分行曁成都分行延期公吿恢復鎳幣使用，乘機牟利一案，昨據國行負實人稱：據報載，本行昆蓉兩分行，於財政經濟緊急處分令頒佈後，對於舊鎳輔幣改作金圓券輔幣恢復行使一項，延期數日始行公佈，致市塲掀起搶購鎳幣之風，乘機牟利，擾亂金融，不無因循賣職舞弊之嫌，業經滇川兩省參議會分別檢舉，並電請中樞嚴予澈査懲處等語。關於本案營私舞弊部份，除中樞已密切注意査究外，總行方面對此至爲重視，現正派員澈査中，相信當有事實可資根究，在眞相尙未判明前，總行不擬表示任何意見。惟對於分行延期公吿恢復輔幣使用一節，總行認爲或有事實上之困難，縁本行發行金圓券輔幣券及輔幣係於八月二十日公吿，並同時電吿各地分行，當時因全文過長，內容複雜，且分行單位衆多，不得不摘要發電，致各地分行接電後，對於發行金圓券轉幣，多因技術上細節不明，不敢卽行公佈，反覆電請總行釋示者，因此電訊往返，不免稍費時日，且此類震要電訊，因電碼繁密，翻譯需時，與普通商業電訊，固不相同，而譯電人員，因須特別審愼，譯電時聞亦較普通電訊爲長，故昆蓉兩地分行，對於延期公吿發行輔幣一節，是否故意，須待嚴密調査後，方可判定。至於公吿期前，有無乘機舞弊之舉，則屬事實問題題，不難澈底根究云。</p>

<p>（上接第一版）第一期：自本年四月至六月三個月中，由美國國會批准由復興銀公司墊付總數計美金三千六百五十萬美元，規定用途爲：（一）糧食一千三百五十萬美元，（二）棉花一千三百萬美元，（三）肥料一百五十萬美元，（四）油料八百萬美元，（五）調査經費五十萬美元。上列各款，糧食一項，計可購得麵粉約九千噸，米約六萬七千噸，棉花約七萬包，肥料約一萬零四百廿噸，油料一項，則以燃料油爲主，計値二百九十餘萬美元，次爲柴油，計値一百七十餘萬美元，再次爲車用汽油，計値一百餘萬美元，其餘飛機汽油，煤汕，潤滑油原油等共値二百餘萬美元。</p>
<p>第二期：自本年七月至九月三個月中，支用總數爲美金七千一百廿萬元，分配如下：（一）糧食六百五十萬美元，（二）棉花四千一百七十萬美元，（三）油料一千四百萬美元，（四）肥料四百萬美元，（五）工業器材五百萬美元。以上糧食一項，約可購得麵粉九千噸，米二萬二千噸，棉花約廿三萬二千餘包；肥料一項，正由技術專家會同美國經濟合作總署中國分署，共商進行採購及分配辦法；油料業已估計需要，核算第二期應購數量，由美國經濟分署及我國技術團貝團長，向美國經濟合作總署提出，尙待批准；至工業器材一項，須司徒立門調査團所提建設方案核定後始可着手辦理。</p>
<p>第三期：自本年十月至十二月，及第四期自明年一月至三月兩期撥款，包括建設專款在內，共爲一億六千七百卅萬元，其中可供採購物資部份，計約爲美金一億元，此款如何分期支配，雙方正在擬議中。</p>
<p>截至八月卅一日止，第一二兩期運到之物資，計有米六萬五千七百卅長噸，麵粉八千九百卅九長噸，起運在途者，計有米一萬一千一百六十八長噸，麵粉八千九百六十一長噸，運到之食米，已經交由民調會配售者，計上海市六萬一千七百四十六長噸，廣州市二千六百八十五長噸，包括汕頭市一千五百長噸在內。上海市民調會業已售出之數量，則爲三萬七千二百六十三點八〇長噸，實收價款，計金圓二百三十三萬九千三百〇二元九角五分。棉花一項，已得美方同意，卽將兩期撥款，移付中國紡織建設公司原來訂購而已運到上海之美棉價歡，第一期劇騰美授項下棉花六萬九千八百七十八包，正在辦理報關手續提貨之中；第二期劃歸美援項下棉花二十三萬二千餘包，已由美方簽發付款通知書，亦可報關提貨。油料一項，亦係將兩期撥欲移付，業已到滬之油料價款，俟美方核准，及付款手續完備後，當可提貨。</p>
<p>物資運用方式</p>
<p>至於各類物資之運用方式略述如下：（甲）糧食米麵之運用，仍循各大口岸都市配米方式供應配售，現除京·滬·平·津·穗·五大都市外，靑島暫亦在內。上項措施，可减少國內產米區對於上述各大都市之供應，使內地糧價，漸趨平穩，同時售價收入，可以移作扶助農工業之用，使有關各地均沾美援利益，惟配售價格，擬求與市價相接近，蓋售價過低，則形同救濟一部份人民，似欠公允，同時收入减少，則運用之利益，亦因而减低，但據美方估計，美援全部糧食，僅敷前列各大都市配量百分之四十强，故如實行配售，其餘百分之六十弱，須由我政府自行籌供，而美援糧食可能購得之數量，因世界糧食限額及收穫季節關係，未必能盡如我方之希望，同時美援部份及我政府籌供部份，在時間配合上，亦須加以注意，故配糧問題，仍由本會隨時與主管部商洽籌劃，以求解決。（乙）棉花，據最近估計，自本年七月起，至明年三月止九個月內，我國紡織業原棉，不敷約九十至九十五萬包，在美援項下所得美棉祇及三十六萬包，尙缺六十萬包，爲補救起見，美援棉花之資金應設法使其周轉運用，以賢維持生產。經棉花委員會議定分配原則：（一）以棉易紗或布，（二）易後之紗布，一半外銷，一半內銷，（三）外銷紗布所得外匯，由美援會及美經分署，共同管理，換購棉花或有關用品，以維國內之生產。關於棉花易紗之比例，亦經多次商討現已折衷議定，第一期照棉五百九十九磅，易換廿支紗四百磅算，第一期美棉六萬九千八百七千八包，日內可交由花紗布聯運處，分配各廠紡紗。（下轉第三版）</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕合衆社十三日探悉：西方三國在倫敦所準備而交付莫斯科三使節之訓令現已竣事，其內容「不啻在莫斯科直接談判中要求攤牌」。三使節將向蘇聯解釋西方對蘇聯之背信負義已感不耐，而不許此種勞而無功之方式繼績存在。此非向史達林呼籲，事實上，此一訓令之堅强口氣，跡近最後通牒，雖西方外交家仍不願使用此一名詞。據悉，訓令肯定指出，史達林與西方使節在莫斯科協議之程序，及蘇政府致索柯洛夫斯基之命令，在精神及內容上均大相逕庭。按當初協議，在目前止，柏林會議應已成立協定，而爲外長會議打開出路，以討論因德國引起之全世界局勢，最後促使歐洲之緊張局面能吿鬆弛。反之，柏林封銷依然如故，局勢惡化，全面狀態愈趨下坡，因談判之必趨破裂而引起「非凡嚴重之局面」。西方旣決定在莫斯科採取新方策，能否有進展尙未能預卜，故在倫敦舉行之三强討論目的在草擬一對策，以應付一且莫斯科會談破裂後之局面。英法兩國均不甚願意將此事移交聯合國，宣稱應以絕大耐心應付莫斯科，並堅持直接談判。現耐心已屆枯竭階段，僉信三國已在原則上同意於九月廿一日將該案提交聯大會。此間特別强調，西方三國對最後方法失敗後之方針已吿決定，「且完全團結一致」。某西方發言人稱，「吾人之堅決態度實毫無疑問，此非向史達林呼籲之謂。局勢已遠超此點，目前已形成攤牌局面」。莫斯科目前可能已認淸，史達林及莫洛托夫在莫斯科所表明之意見與索帥在柏林之舉動頗爲格格不入。此間一般對整個局勢極端悲觀，輿論對柏林會談之僵持日感驚惶，貝文外相可望對談判情形發表綜合性文吿。此間認爲莫斯科談判不應聽其似過去一般擱淺，故西方以最直率之言語明吿蘇聯，此其時矣。外部發言人稱，「西方三國間對柏林局勢之次一步驟已有協議」，然不發表「次一步驟」之性質，然稱有關之消息不久將發表。發言人又稱，其言謂三國以前意見不一致，然在談判初期，三國當然不可能絕對相同。倫敦之「三人委員會」十三日不擬舉行會議，然法大使馬西格里與外部官員曾作談話。</p>

<p>（上接第二版）（丙）油料運用方式現經商定：（一）現時限額及限額外進口制度，仍予繼續。（二）現行飛機用油，柴油，及燃料油分配辦法，仍予繼鐵。（三）上海市汽車用油，仍照現行方式定量分配，其他各地亦將同樣辦理。（四）煤油·機油·潤滑油等，今由油公司委託其代理商經售。（五）售價參照成本及外匯比價決定，務使切合實際，一面顧及公用事業之成本。（六）准許石油進口商經營美援油料，惟須合乎供應經濟之原則，一俟報關提油及確定價格，卽擬照此實施。又據估計，美援油料將以百分之六十供應交通公用事業，其餘百分之四十，則供一般消費之用。（丁）肥料：美援肥料計十萬噸，現僅決定分配辦伕如次：（一）以四萬噸左右之肥料，經由民營商家在中國大陸上出售。（二）保留不超過一萬噸數量之肥料，以供中國農村復與委員會之用，其計劃由該會於十月間提交經合總署審核。（三）暫時保留五萬順左右之肥料，以備糧食緊急購儲在台灣購買大米之用。（四）第二項或第三項所保留之肥料，如因未能作有利之使甩而有剩餘時，將由民營商家經手出售。（五）肥料專爲糧食生產之用，對於產米應於優先考慮。以上係最近雙方決定辦法，但爲便利推行起見，第一期肥料將先集中台灣試辦。</p>
<p>關於美援對我復興建設計劃，原定貸給復興建設專款美金六千萬元，另工業補充器材一千萬美元，卽屬前述贈與項下者。自司徒立門調查圑作廣泛之工業調查，並經研究後，認爲我國工業當前最大需要，乃在工業所需之配件，故又將工業器材配件與復興建設專款改爲各佔美金三千五百萬元，减少貸給之數字，而增加贈與部份，對我自較便利。對於各方申請援助之中，竭力選擇適當之對象，現經選定：（一）開灤礦務局，（二）揚十電力公司，（三）平津電力廠，（四）台灣糖業公司四單位，爲第一枇援助對象，援助數額共爲美金四百四十萬元，因上述四家在我國工業上均佔重要地位，關係民生至切，故應首先援助。至繼續援助及如何分配事宜，現由政府派本會委員嚴家淦偕同司徒立門於本月四日飛美，參加美國經濟合作總署會議，共作商討，作一決定。</p>
<p>運用委會組織</p>
<p>這裏順帶報吿一下美援運用委員會的組織。美援運用委員會隸屬於行政院，除委員會在京滬兩地與美經合分署配合辦公外，並在平·津·靑·穗等地分設辦事處，因鑒於過去若干物資處理機構組織龐大，開支浩繁，故力求緊凑靈活，祗作一個決策及監理執行之機構，而不直接參與業務，所有輸入物資，均分由各主管機關負責出售，（比如糧食，卽委託各地民食調配委員會分別貯售），所以委員以下所有各處室辦事處及各小組委員會，合起來之人數，不到二百人，其待遇一律照政府頒佈公務人員待遇辦法，與一般國營事業機構職員並無二致，而各級職員多數還是向各有關機構借調而來的，所以開支不大。道一由美國政府爲了執行法案成立了美國經濟合作總署，與歐亞各接受援助國家接洽美援事務，在中國的駐華分署，由賴樓翰君主持其事，本會與美國經濟合作總署中國分署經常取得密切聯繫，並迭經舉行聯席會議，又爲配合美方措施，我們在美京派有技術代表團，與美經合總署及其他機構隨時接洽。此外美援會並會同有關及主管機構，合組糧食·棉花·石油等小組，常川集議，檢討物資之支配方針及其有關問題。</p>
<p>以上報吿了美援運用工作的大略，在報吿結束之前，特別再提一下政府配合美援的自助方案。在張院長任內，自助十大綱領業已公佈，現在翁院長更公佈了新的經濟措旅，發行新幣，頒佈財經緊急處分辦法，以上都是政府根據雙邊協定，推行有力的自助計劃的鐵證，也就是非常有效地配合美援，安定經濟的辦伕，我們深信以自力更生配合美援，以美援助成自力更生，才是美援遝用的眞正意義。今日我們面臨最嚴重的關頭，剿匪戡亂的大目的之下，軍事經濟均成爲成敗關鍵，經濟之動態尤其直接影響每一國民的日常生活，美援在今日之重要，不言可喻，　請各位同志多加督導，使這次的美援收得最良好的效果。</p>

<p>借貸無着　套購港匯</p>
<p>當因定銀限期急迫，由榮鴻元兩囑該公司駐港代表陳元直，向香港上海銀行商借，陳元直因借款無着，遂託由該行職員潘耀文向專營外匯業務之道亨號，購買三十七年六月一日及及二日期之申匯港幣十八萬九千六百五十元，拆合法幣四百一十億，指定由上海唐堯安等七家收款。榮鴻元於接獲陳元直致陸錦章譯轉之電報通知後，派陸錦章分別送交唐堯安法幣八十億，宮崇瑞法幣六十億，林斯平法幣一百三十億，梁千里法幣三十億，李實英法幣三十億，周德法幣二十億，光華行法幣三十億，尙有三十億交由何處套匯，已爲被吿榮鴻元所不能記憶</p>
<p>航空平信　詳開地址</p>
<p>事後陳元直復以航空平信開列唐堯安等七家之詳細地點及應付款項之數字，交由榮鴻元核對，經淞滬警備司令部查獲，攝取照片，交由上海市警察局將其拘獲，轉解偵查到案。（二）證據及所犯法條查榮鴻元以申新紡織公司名義，向盛亨洋行訂購印棉一千五百件，在香港應付之二成定銀港幣十八萬九千六百五十元，於接獲陳元直之通知後，派由陸錦章分別送交唐堯安等七家法幣四百一十億各情，已據直認不諱，幷有陳元直航空平信之照片及盛亨洋行之合同存案可憑，犯罪事實，已臻明確。</p>

<p>雖據辯稱：「我因公司缺乏原料，向香港上海銀行洽借定銀，陳元直未得我的同意，擅自購買申匯，我爲維持申新信用，祇得照付。一等語，但查駭被吿旣明知陳元直購買申匯理應去電阻止退還定銀竟以維特商業信用爲詞，指派譯轉套匯電報之陸錦章交付款項，其應與陳元直，潘耀文，陸錦章共同負擔經營外匯業務之責，事極明顯，自不能以其採辦生產原料，購置申匯爲理由，得邀倖免。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕英商電車公司職工去年中秋節前，曾向公司預借薪金半月，分期扣還。今年中秋節將屆，各部職工早已紛紛要求循例預借薪金。工會乃於九月五日開會決定請公司借支薪金二十天過節，分四個月扣還。公司表示無力借支，遂無結果。因此職工情緒激昂，至昨日淸農，職工照常開車出廠，但售票員實行「大减價」，不論遠近，一律收法幣十萬元。工會勸導無效，至十時半，工會理事長仇長江等乃赴社會局謁見趙副局長報吿經過，時吳市長亦已據報，當通知社會局，轉飭工人卽刻恢復常態。社會局發出緊急命令，工會負責人亦返歸勸導，至十一時三十五分，各綫電車乃全部恢復常態售票，靜候社會局調處。據職工表示，公司每日收人在上月份幣制未改革前，爲法幣四百億左右，近日收入良好，每日均在六百億左右，職工薪金並無增加，資方所稱無力支借顯係推諉。</p>

<p>— 本報記者　邢若風</p>
<p>〔本報承德七日航訊〕承機這個山城，因爲它是昔日的滿淸皇帝的避暑聖地，所以到現在還有不少的遺蹟，雖然幾經砲火的洗禮，滄海變遷，而外省人到此還都要逛逛「八大廟」。當地人對於舊時的憶憬，更是津津樂談。據說從前皇帝駐　，冠蓋往來的時候，離宮裏避暑山莊，十大處以及外八廟中，有許多的珍貴寳物，晚淸庚子八國聯軍把北京所謂「大內」的寳物洗刦後，熱河的竇物多數便運到北京遞補「大內」作陳列品了。殘存的寳物，後來便搬進了熱河寳物館（館址在離宮內），其驚經過二十年的軍閥時代，館中寳物也就因年代而减少。淪陷時期，日人管理該館十餘載，據說寳物館經日人一番研究，裝飾得很像樣，但實際却有的變成膺品了。其中最寳貴而徼倖保留的珍品，祗有十件周銅祭器，簡稱呌做「周銅十件」。</p>
<p>周銅考古</p>
<p>「周銅十件」，按考古家的分析及「承德府誌」上所記載：它確是稀有的國寳了。「八一五」日寇降伏後，未幾，蘇聯兵由塞北兼程進入承德，從此秩序滇　，所有文物全被弄的人仰馬翻·「周銅十件」，從那時起，就乘亂不見了。八路在承德盤踞了一個年，當然，無人談起此事，直至三十五年秋國軍收復了承德，周銅的事，才又舊話萬提。</p>
<p>本寶提名</p>
<p>黨時，對這十件國寳的去踪，是難免要疑神疑鬼，大家都認爲不易再完璧歸趙，然而却被當時的承德縣長范　尋獲了七件。嗣經省府呈報中央，范縣長因此榮膺傳令嘉獎。尋回這七件寳物的名稱：（一）周蟠　壼，（二）局雷紋壼，（三）周叔朕　（缺底）（四）周賓尊，（五）周素洗，（六）周當紋爵，（七）周蟠　　，（缺蓋）。除此數件外，尙未尋獲的還有三件，卽（八）周文王鼎，（九）周夢風卣，（十）周蟬文簋了。</p>
<p>「文土鼎」</p>
<p>上面所說的已經尋回的七件寳物，當今夏承德保衛戰時，省府已運往北平，妥加保管。其餘三件，却總是杳然。想不到近由軍方又尋獲了一件「文王鼎」，這眞是「無巧不成書」了。該鼎已於五日由綏區石覺將軍派人送交省參議會統一保管。參議會於六日召開鑑定會議，當地　宿多人參加，珍重辨別，認爲該寳確係文王鼎無訛。當塲衡量該鼎重爲六斤七兩（十兩新秤），全身高公分二五，三，耳高四，四耳闊四，四，腹深九，五，口縱一六，五，口橫一二，五，腿高一二，二，鑑定畢拴　標誌，與會人蓋印證明，卽送交省府入庫保管，並聯名函謝石覺司令官，對原發現人請爲傳令嘉獎，以資褒功。</p>
<p>至此：「周銅十件」未足之數僅佔其二了。當地某老人說：「周銅十件是相傳三千餘年的國寳，旣然有了八件，那兩件的出世也必不遠。」</p>

<p>夠光荏苒，又屆新秋；溯本局復興迄今倐已寒暑三易，回顧旣往，瞻念將來，當茲佳節重臨，益懍淵冰之懼。猶憶凱歌初播，日月重輝，當軸以電信重要，令秉堅等首先溝通上海與渝蓉等處之電信業務，可謂着祖逖之先鞭，爲復員之前導，旣而受命接收上海電信事業于頑敵之手，萬端經緯，事至繁頣，及今雖已陳迹，然於我國電信史上宜爲光榮之一頁，抑亦足覘電信於國家社會之重要性也！</p>
<p>三年胼胝，宜可有成，徒以絀於資材時覺難從心願，事業擴展，影響自多；然於工程建設，業務設施，每竭鷲駘，黽勉將事，如報話設備之增加，收訊電台之與建，以及電信人才之培養，胥在本局資材匱乏之中，羅掘以赴；又如業務之革新，速率之增加，以及服務之求普遍周到，更無時不在遵從上峯指示率劃改進之中。所幸經年努力，不無寸進；雖同人用侖所致，亦社會人士熱忱合作所促成</p>

<p>— 工務概況</p>
<p>建設之策動，有賴交通爲之先導，而電信又爲交通之交通，其使命之重大，自無待論，吾國電信事業創辦至今，已有六十餘年之歷史，由草創以至粗具規模，歷受內亂之阻擾，外患之摧殘，幾經慘淡經營，不斷改進，就設備而言，已自莫爾斯機，進而爲電傳打字機及傳眞電報機，或自磁石式話機，進而爲自動電話機，以至於載波電話機，已臻向榮之境。而上海爲通商巨埠，綰交通之樞紐，位居首要，設備尤應充實，勝利以還，荏苒三載，回憶此三年之間，因敵方遺留電信機械之簡陋，材料之缺乏，益以外匯支細，補充不易，以致電信設備之整頓擴充，困難滋甚，幸賴上峯之諄諄督導，工作同人之和衷共濟，奮勉努力，得勉隕越，爰本檢討過去，策勵未來之旨，將本局工務槪况，舉其犖犖大者，撮要紀述，諒爲關切電信諸君所樂聞也</p>
<p>中央室</p>
<p>中央室位於福州路四川路口總營業處樓上，爲收發報機件之神經中樞，收發電報集中於此，由營業處收下之『去報』，經遞送器傳至報房，用鑿孔機在油紙條上逐字繫成連續之小孔，以鑿就之紙條裝於自動發報機上或電傳打字機上發爲信號電流。是項電流　，經遙控設備傳輸至發訊台發射。至對方發來之信號電波，則先由收訊台接收，亦經遙控設備，傳輸至中央室，再經放大後由波紋機（或人工機）錄爲電碼，或由電傳打字機直接打成文字。故中央室集收發報機於一堂，隨時與各地聯絡，加遠弗屆，本局中央室現有電傳打字機二十四具，自動發報機二十具，音響機三具　，人工機二十一具，十二路載波機二座，四路載波機四座，放大器三十八具，是項放大器尙感不敷應用，刻在驚劃擴充，預計年內可以增爲四十五具，中央室並附設修機室，備有車床鑽床磨輪等工作機及高週率振盪器，萬用電表，眞空管電壓表，轍出電表等儀器，遇有機械發生故障，可於十五分鐘內修復。</p>
<p>發訊台</p>
<p>發訊台計有南翔，虹口，建國西路，復興島及福州路等五處，以南翔規模爲最大，佔地約二百餘畝，爲國內無綫電報括之發訊中心。全局現有之發訊機，最大者爲3KW，最小者爲200W，共計四十四座，其中五座用於發話，其餘專供發報之用。至發訊天綫，經三年來之整理擴充，已有定向者三十付，非定向者二十六付，年內尙擬增設定向者四付，俾得提高通信效率。南翔台以性質甫要，自備125KVA油機發訊機一座，足供全台用量，每遇市電中斷，隨時開機使用，可免停頓之虞，他若遙控制及發射機之工作情形，更裝有指示器顯示，可以一目瞭然。南翔發訊台亦附設修機室，車牀鑽牀等工作機具備，對於本身修配機件工作，差堪應付。</p>
<p>收訊台</p>
<p>本局現以閘北收訊台為收訊主體，佔地數十畝，除福州路，虹口，復興岛，及西康路等處亦各有收訊機若干外，並有一部份附設於國際無綫電台之劉行收訊台。全局現有分集式收訊機十具，單機四十九具。因劉行台佔地較廣，所有分集式收訊機均設於此。本局爲謀擴展業務計，已在郊區七寳購地百畝，另建新收訊台，以應需要，按照預定計劃，分三期興建，第一期工程現已完成，預計明春可以全部　事，至遙控電纜之架設，刻正積極進行，不久卽可完工。</p>
<p>傳真機室</p>
<p>傳眞電報，可類別爲照相電報與眞蹟電報兩種。前者可將照相藉電能傳至對方，節對方收受之底片，仍藉照相術顯影冲晒等手續印成照相；後者則可將　筆　寫之文字或圖表等藉呢能傳至對方，直接收得維妙維肖之眞蹟。本局所有之傳眞電報機卽爲眞蹟電報機，現僅一架，專對南京一地通信，平時採用加綫載波電路傳輸，遇加綫電情况欠穩定時？隨時改用有綫電路，故極優良可靠。我國文字特殊，未能採用字母拼昔法，致普通電報，須先蔣文字譯成電礁發至對方，由對方再將電碼譯成文字，不特手績過繁，多費時間，且難免發生錯誤，茲者採用是項眞蹟電報機件，旣可增加傳遞速率，且可保證絕對準確，實爲值得提倡之新設備也</p>
<p>長途電話室</p>
<p>長途電話室設於虹口本局三樓，爲全國長途電話之樞紐。用戶通話，先由記錄台爲之登記，然後順序由長途台逐一代爲接通，爲實施工作人員之考勤計，並設有監察台，可以隨時監聽其工作情形。總計現有紀錄台六座席，監察台一座席，長途專綫台二座席，有綫長途台二十四座席，無綫長途合四座席。復在隔壁另闢一室，裝置國際長途台四座席，專爲對美國，英國，茄拿大，古巴等國遠洋通話之用，年來長途電話業務發展甚速，現有設備，不敷應用，亟待擴充，已向美國訂購長途合六十　席，以應業務擴展之需。</p>
<p>無綫電話　終端機室</p>
<p>終端機室之作用，一如中央室之與電報然，爲加綫電通話之神經中樞。用戶發出之話音信號，須由長途台經終端機傳輸至發訊台發射，而收訊台收到對方發話之信號，亦須先經終端機轉至長途台後傳輸至用戶之聽筒，其功能可使發話與收聰互不衝突。又因終端機有放大作用，並可調節音量之高低，防止「反饋」（Reed　Oack）所引起之　　鳴」（Singing）故其功用至關重要，本局現有是項終端機五座。茲爲適應業務上迅速擴展之需要起見，不久更將增設一座。</p>
<p>市內電話　交換所</p>
<p>本局區域遼闊，北至吳淞，南達閔行東跨浦東，西及七寳，幅負之廣，爲全國各特別市冠，市內電話需要殷切，但以材料補充不易，服務自難週到，現有交換所計虹口，南市，市中心，浦東。吳淞，復興島，眞如，龍華及閔行等九處，除前三者有敵潰機鍵堪資利用外，其餘六所均爲勝利後三年中另籌器材先後規復或增設者。茲將各交換所現有容量開列於後：虹口計自動機二千七百號；南市計自動機二千號；市中心計自動機六百號，浦東計人工機三百號，吳淞計人工機二百號；復興島計人工機二百號；眞如計人工機六十號；龍華計人工機二百號，閔行計人工機三十號。綜上所述，可知各交換所規模尙小，故未能於每一所內附設修機室，僅在虹口交換所設置一電話修機室，設備尙欠充實。最近虹口交換所正在積極進行擴充工程，約於年內可以　事，又爲顧及滬西郊區之需要，並已計劃籌設七室交換所，年內或可完成。</p>
<p>綫路設備：本局市內話綫，遍佈全市，凡第（七）節所述各交換所之營業區，均可通達，其中以虹口與南市二區，尤爲稠密。各交換所之間，均有中繼綫聯絡，足數經常通話之用，至電報遙控綫，則以中央室爲重心，四散分佈，接通各發訊台及各收訊台，以收聯絡傳輸之功。上述兩種綫路，可分爲架空明綫，架空電纜及地下電纜三類。又以黃浦江劃分本市爲東西二區，浦東與浦西之通信，仰賴水底電纜爲之聯絡，本局已擇地敷設是項水底電纜三處，專供中繼綫及電話專綫之用。茲歸納各種綫路設備，開列數量於後：計木桿八千五百根，架空明綫一千二百八十對公里，架空電纜約二百公里，地下管導約十公里，地下電纜約一百三十公里，水底電纜約三·五公里。最近因籌設七寳收訊台及七寳交換所，對於該處日後所需遙控綫及中繼綫工程，業經開工，月內可吿完成。</p>
<p>機械之修配</p>
<p>本局所有機械，種類之多，設備之廣，旣如上述。其所需配料，自不能全部仰給於外洋，故於復員之初，卽着手籌設電信機械修配所，以自製或修配各式電信機件及零件爲鵠的。先於卅五年春就周家嘴路新東電機廠廠址成立，於同年十月正式開工。旋因房屋狹小，設備簡陋，雖經逐步推進，難期發展。遂於卅六年秋設法收回浦東周家渡前交通部電信機械修造所廠屋，重加修建，經數月之驚備，將全部機器遷入，計有工塲三所，料棧一所，宿舍二幢，辦公房一幢，連同電力室，俱樂部，膳廳，廚房等佔地約十餘畝，尙有餘地堪資擴建工塲。數經擴充整頓，已具規模，現有大小各式車床，鑽床，銑床，刨床，鋸床，衝床，萬能磨床，及捲片機，刻字機等六十餘部，每月所出機件零件，數以萬計，除供應本局需要外，並代蘇浙皖等附近各局修理機件。</p>
<p>其他　本局復員之後，因修理舊機綫，充實新設備，需用材料甚多，但以勝利之初，中外航運未通，市上商行存貨，又爲敵僞收括殆盡，故所需之料，由後方空運一部分濟用外，祗能就敵偽殘餘材料中，擇其可資應用者，稍資補苴，其後航運漸通，除外洋訂購料已略有進口外，並由行總撥到救濟料及美軍剩餘料數批，此外並向敵僞產業處理局價購敵偽電信料十餘批。上項材料，爲數不少，但因屬於軍用性質，且類多殘缺不全，故於運用之前，必須大加整修改裝，益以點收，儸藏，及配發等手續繁瑣，已非本處材料科原有人手所堪勝仔，於是增設材料儲運室，秉承電信總局之命，配發運轉，供應全國各局濟用，旋因救濟料中有無綫電器材一批，大都爲美海軍剩餘料，數量龐大，損壞特甚，需要寬敞之棧房與工塲及技術專才方克整理之，遂於眞如南翔分建廠房十二所，並向國際電台借調工程師及技術員若干人，另立機構整修之。自去秋起，交通部成立領用物資委員會，與國防部分配並點騐「物資供應局」運到之冲繩島器村，又須本局協同辦理，復調集平津漢渝陜粵京諸局技術員十餘人專任其事，至目前爲止，經本局點騐，整修，配發而撥運至全國各地之電信器材，已達一萬餘順，是項工作，所耗人力財力，頗爲可觀，每有疲於奔命之惑。此外尙有無綫電料進口護照與轉口憑證之核發以及廣播電台之整理，亦爲本處附帶工作之一部份，前者性質較爲雙純，工作尙少　　，自勝利迄今，輸入收音機達十三萬具，萬中以三十五年三月政府開放國際匯兌以後至當年冬限制進口以前之時期中，進口數量達十一萬六千餘具，實堪驚人。至於整理廣播電台工作，雖迭經查封取締，非法電台，但尙未納入正軌，有待繼續努力。</p>
<p>本局工務槪况，已如上述，其設備雖較復員之時已擴充數倍，尙不足適應社會之需要。然回顧三年之中，或因人手缺乏，或因經費支絀，或因材料不濟，捉襟見肘、顧此失彼，沉着邁進，困難重重，得有今日差强人意之規模，悉賴上峯之督導，以及本處六百餘同人胼手胝足，奮力從公之功也。抗戰勝利，已屆三週年，環　全國，民生困苦，百業凋零，瞭望來茲，彌深暢勵。本年下半年度之中心工作，如虹口交換所之擴充，南市交換所電源之改善，長途台之改裝，無綫電話機之增闢、南翔發訊台定向天綫之增設以及電源設備之加强，中央室設備之充實，終端機室之遷移，以及　寳　訊合與交換所之興建等工程，雖有卽將完成者，或正在積極加聚施工中者，但尙有待料而迄禾着手者，促其完成，尙須戮力以赴，願假此佳日，誌之以與同人共勉，更祈海內高明進而敎之，幸莫大焉。</p>
<h3 id="c90">本局業務之進展 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 李桐</p>
<p>本局復員以來，倐已三載，其間關於業務之整頓改進，實覺頭緒紛繁，陣碍重重，所幸當局之督促與社會各方之支持曁電信同人之努力，繼往開來，不無相當之進展。茲將本局年來業務之發展，舉其綱要，略述於後：</p>
<p>甲·電報</p>
<p>（一）增闢電路</p>
<p>本局有無綫電路經二年來規劃調度，積極與內地溝地，恢復南北通訊，通都大邑，均有直達電路可通，近復開放烟台懷寗，鄭州，濟南等處無綫直達電路，天津杭州蕪湖三電路，又加裝電傳打字機以增進通報效率。其他各電路視報務情形，隨時增開第二路第三路，以疏報務自下本局直達電路計有綫電路二十路，無綫電路卅路</p>
<p>（二）激增中之報務</p>
<p>一年來市塲波動頻繁，電報業務每在物價動盪時，大量激增，以有限之人手與機件應付無限激增之電報，工作之緊張與繁忙可以想見。茲將本年電報份數與上年比較如下：</p>
<p>（三）特快電盡量擴展</p>
<p>電報業務旣增而電路容量有限，依序拍發，難免稍有積延爲適應各界需求，各重要電路開放特快電報，該項電報提前拍發，以爭時效，實行以來，成績卓著，頗爲各界所稱道，迭經陸續治商開放，現有特快電路已增至二十六處。</p>
<p>（四）舉行電報準確運動</p>
<p>據統計，去年內，全國有五萬餘份電報無法投送，內因收報人姓名住址不全或書寫不淸者約佔三萬份以上，爲撲滅與减少此種錯誤，本年特舉行電報準確運動。除印製籤條十萬份分發各用戶請予合作外，並加强正誤校對，加緊抽查，實施以來，對於電報錯誤日見减少，錯誤百分比已由0．132％减少至0．032％。</p>
<p>（五）實行分區投送</p>
<p>爲增進電報投送速度，實行分區投送來報，已於中出南路與西康路各成立來報投送分處，刻正繼續在重要地區籌劃增設是項投送分處。</p>
<p>（六）遷移報房集中工作</p>
<p>本局無綫電人工機報房原設閘北育嬰堂路，報務處理極感不便，爲集中工作，增進效能計，經採遙控收訊制，遷併中央室集中收發，現各重要電路已大部遷竣。</p>
<p>（七）成立稽察電台</p>
<p>爲適應業務及環境之需要，成立稽察電台，該台工作範圍，分廣播稽察及通訊稽察兩部份，成立以來，整理本市廣播電台，及破獲私設電台，已獲有相當之成就。</p>
<p>（八）採用華文打字機抄　譯來報</p>
<p>添置專供譯電用之華文打字機十部，分別在有無綫報房應用，因機件不數，速度稍慢，現僅用以抄譯交際電報及非掛號用戶之來報。</p>
<p>（九）舉辦報差兼收覆電業務</p>
<p>報差於送報時得兼收覆電，凡來報電文中有要求電覆者，經繕封員加蓋「請電覆」戳記於報封，交差投送，經詢明如需卽發回電，報差可按手續將轟電及報費收下帶回局中拍發，甚爲迅捷</p>
<p>乙·電話　A長途電話業務</p>
<p>（一）舉辦特快電話告回業務</p>
<p>特快電話自去年開放以來，因用戶需要量過鉅，供求相差懸殊，本局爲顧及接通時限，須隨時婉予停止掛號，惟用戶因需要迫切，往往願不計時限申請准予掛號。本局乃採取「特快回吿」辦法，將所有掛號用戶，一一登記，交由回吿台約計接通時刻，以電話通知用戶，實行以來，用戶認爲滿意，並於八月間開放滬津滬渝間特快電話，蕪湖徐州江都等地特快電話亦次第驚放。</p>
<p>（二）增開代傳電話</p>
<p>自去年三月開辦代傳電話以來，用戶莫不稱便，爰自本年一月起凡與本局有直達電路各局，均先後開放代傳業務。</p>
<p>（三）配合長話需要增闢通話路綫</p>
<p>去歲九月，本局通往各地之長話有綫電路計六十三對，無綫電路通達地點計有靑島·北平·漢口·天津·重慶·台北·濟南·廣州等八處。國際通話計中美無綫電路兩路，本年度在器材來源匱乏下，勉力擴充機綫，計增加南京·杭州·蚌埠·安徽等十四路。國內無綫增闢蘭州·福州·昆明等通話地點。並鑒於滬津話務繁忙，又增闢電路一對。國際雷話於本年三月一日開放中英無綫通話，於六月一日開放墨西哥古巴加拿大三地通話。並訂九月十五開放檀香山通話，而香港無綫電話亦在試話中。長途接綫台亦於三月間增設六座席。</p>
<p>（四）改進服務</p>
<p>凡長話工作人員，昀先後分批施以訓練，灌輸各項業務規章及服務道德，應答態度等，以達到「態度謙和一「服務週到」爲目的。</p>
<p>B市內電話業務</p>
<p>（一）開放同綫電話　本市電話供不應求，機鍵補充緩不濟急，為顧及市民之需要，凡能商得鄰近本局用戶之同意者，可會同申請裝置同綫電話，以資合用。</p>
<p>（二）普設公用電話　本市各區自裝設電話以來，市民得隨地利用。本局除於市區內勤定適當地點增設公用電話外，並於梅瀧眞如大塲新涇殷翔港龍華北蔡張江栅等處並設郊區公用電話，以利公衆。</p>
<p>（三）裝設專綫電話　本市電話於物價波動時以用戶通話增繁，每不易接通。本局有鑒於此，凡機關工廠之分處辦公者，均勸裝專綫電話，俾總辦公處與附屬機構間可立卽通話，　收指臂之效，並减少市內電話之通話率。</p>
<p>（四）成立報時台　本局為便利市民除於虹口南市兩交換所播送海關鐘聲外，並設立報時台。凡用戶欲知標準時間者可撥十七號，卽得報吿。</p>
<p>（五）設立服務台　服務台專審外界詢問火車輪船飛機等等離到日期及時間。</p>
<p>（一）登業處增設打字電報機　爲使去報傳遞迅速，上年間會在愚園路，長治路，北站三分營業處，及新新公司電報代收處，裝置打字電報機各一具，本年繼續在四川北路，及中山南路二分處裝置上英機器。</p>
<p>（二）簡化去報處理手續　各分處所收去報傳遞及處理手續，力求合理，工作人員職務之分配，時加調度。</p>
<p>（三）編訂各分處工作須知　按各營業處事實之需要，業務之繁簡，分別編訂飭知遵行。</p>
<p>（四）補充訓練營業員　就業務上應用智識，編印講養以供業餘研讀。</p>
<p>（五）定期召開檢討會議定期召集各營業單位負責人員，檢討得失，以資改進。</p>
<p>（六）增設分營業處電事及代辦所　上年九月後，計增設中山南路，市中心，中山東二路三分營業處，西藏南路電亭，太平洋旅行社，招商局第一二碼頭招待所等三電報代收處，周浦，北蔡，張江柵三報話代辦所共計十單位。</p>
<p>（七）示範營業處設公衆服務檯計有總營業處，長治路，中山南路三處，並擇優秀營業員辦理口頭答詢，代爲繕擬去電等各項服務。</p>
<p>（八）舉辦整潔謙和，電報準確及電話節時各項遝動先後定期舉辨，並繼續推行。</p>
<p>（九）延長營業處營業時間　應公衆要求，延長北站分處，文廟電亭，及西藏南路電亭之營業時間。</p>
<p>（十）關於電報查詢，出售有價去報紙，及增加收受時快電報營業處辦理電報錯誤查詢計指定愚園路，中山東二路等十一單位，出售有價去報紙計指定總營業處等十單位，並指定北站分處加辦特快電報業務。</p>
<p>（十一）採用六碼掛號</p>
<p>電報業務激增，四碼掛號早感不敷應用，以致登記電報掛號者往往向隅，經本局詳細研討，計劃改進，已採用六碼掛號，自五〇〇〇〇一至五九九九九九止，幷以前二碼爲分區投送之標識（自五〇—五九），對對於投送電報便利不少，而用戶登記掛號，目能充分供應。</p>
<p>丁·結論</p>
<p>電信爲公衆服務之事業，電信業務應力謀迅速週到，過去一年內，以環境及人力，物力之限制，距離所期尙遠，且公衆需要與時俱進，抑且電信交通爲國家神經系統，各地各局脈絡相通，氣息相關，一着之差動關全國。故今後如何能使上海電信滿足公衆之需求，實爲當務之急，尙祈海內賢達，電界先進，繼續合作，並賜指籤，則電信事業之發展實利賴之。</p>

<h3 id="c115">讀「論虛妄」 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 白永</p>
<p>前些時讀吳　先生的論虛妄，感觸很多。我可以大致下一定義，便是：</p>
<p>「政治的道德，就是不道　也許這話說得太有火氣，尤其我們根本不懂所謂一政治科學」的人，說出這樣的話，難免令「方家齒冷」，然而這也是「心之所安」，不容「虛妄」的。原來道德本無同定標準，我推敲的結果，覺得好像總是在尋求較大的利益，猶之乎孟子所說「所欲有甚於生者，所惡有甚於死者」，道德之極致，怕是就在尋求那「甚於」的東西。「甚於」，以個人爲對象的時候也有，以大衆爲對象的也不缺乏，若能旣顧個人，又顧全體，斯極善矣，否則犧牲一己而救羣的是聖賢，拔一毛而利天下不爲也的是本分，損人以利己的呌小人。可是一到了爭取政權，這些標準就有點扞格，墨子兼愛篇曾經以盜竊殺人喻戰學之不合理，不知世界上的事，本來如是，說好聽些是殺了少敎人可以救多數人也。</p>
<p>這不是理論的而是事實的問題。勝王敗寇的觀念蓄積幾千年，可是漢高祖始終在皇帝的地位，除好發牢騷的司馬遷外，沒人敢把項羽列入本紀，黃巾赤眉就更不必談了。旣是諸侯之門而仁義存焉，那就是要向事實低頭。向事實低頭，誰都不大甘心，可誰都沒法子，一部廿四史，就是這麼寫成的。否則我們的歷史將無法可講、</p>
<p>孟子眞是好玩，一面大吹大擴，「孰能一之！」「不嗜殺人者能一之！」一面却强調湯武之征誅，征誅不是殺人嗎？「聞誅一夫紂矣，未聞弒君也，」可是書經武成篇明明說着「前途倒戈，血流漂杵，」雖然有人說這是誇大，但殺人不少却是實情。那麽，孟老夫子豈不是在打誑語！我如是梁惠王齊宣王也不會歡迎他這套迂論的。大約後世儒家之不近事情，空談無補，殆亦是受此傳統耳。</p>
<p>所以讀書人懷了一肚子仁義道德絕不能作帝王的。也有人把這種「煦煦之仁」駡作「婦人之仁」，其實婦人之仁與大丈夫之仁有何本質之不同？婦人愛小猫小狗，莫非男子就主張把猫兒狗兒都殺光？婦人受了小人的騙，（多半還是男子），難道婦人就該死？凡出發於「愛」的，按理說應該無遠近，無差等，無敵我，才是上帝的意思，婦人之仁何嘗要不得？只是說，要想玩天下於掌中，婦人之仁就要不得了。然而手無搏鷄之力的白面書生，自幼年在學堂起，就吚唔咕嗶於仁仁義義，看見一只臭虫之死都會憑弔，還能談得到焚書坑儒殺人如草不聞聲嗎？不用說，要想爭奪政權，必遭失敗，（他們根本不想這些事，頂多有個太平官兒作就心滿意足了。）就是承襲父兄基業，恐怕也難保其「克享遐齡」。建文皇帝之被逐於燕王，李重光之服牽機藥而死，都是極悽慘的例子。漢高祖拿着博士帽子當夜壼，眞乃偉大，站在政治道德立塲上看，此乃絕對的需要者。而其後來之殺韓信，醢彭越，與朱元璋的殺李善長，辦胡維庸，都是念書人萬萬不肯幹而且咒駡萬端的勾當，不知此正漢高之所以爲漢高，明祖之所以爲明祖也</p>
<p>旣是參不透這個奧秘，跳不出這個圏子，不如索興少點野心好，以免發生大悲劇。老子的話頂對，「道可道，非常道，」如政治的道德，殆卽不可道者，其所以能「常」，正因其「非常」，奇哉！</p>
<h3 id="c116">「燒盤」 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>北平土話稱人們因羞愧而臉紅爲燒盤」，據說「盤」就是臉，「燒」就是紅的意思。</p>
<p>但小說中描寫羞愧，却常有「臉上羞得通紅，一直紅到了頭頸裏」的說法。據旅行家們說，在常常裸禮的比較原始的民族中，羞愧時往往從臉上紅起一直紅到腰裏。但有許多　家的報吿却還要更進一步，他們說，他們描繪人體畫的時候，模特免們有時竟因害羞而致從頭上一直紅到脚上，照北平土話說來可謂「燒」及全身了。</p>

<p>— 何時希</p>
<p>梅蘭芳君應費穆導演之請，攝製彩色影片，欲行銷於國外，聞覇王別姬劍舞一塲已攝竣矣，生死恨一劇才成一小部，劇情猶在斟酌增損中，以爲其事大足商討，竊有意見數點，以與愛梅諸君公開孽論之。</p>
<p>（一）生死恨故事，出於元陶宗儀「輟耕錄」，此次應覓得此書之善本，將此節紀載，在影片之前放映，以作「本事」，俾知此劇有名著爲依據，非嚮壁虛構者。</p>
<p>（二）宜設計一最合理想之中國舞台建築，如穹形台頂，偉大台面，舉凡中國精繡之桌幃大幔門幕等，皆可加以特寫鏡頭，於平劇樂隊（俗稱文武塲面），尤當予以明顯提示，俾外國人或國人之不聰平劇者，藉此以知平劇樂器之組織。</p>
<p>（三）故事開始，第一塲最先出塲之角色，必須使從上塲門步出（以後便取銷大幔門幕）末塲最後下塲之角色，必須使之從重行顯出之門幕中進塲，而後閉幕，俾明確表現此係舞台劇。（編者按：（二）（三）兩點，頗與英國勞侖斯，奧禮維藹爵士之傑作「亨利五世」有似處。）</p>
<p>（四）關於演員之表情，聞有人建議，韓玉娘悲泣之處特多，必須學話劇之仰天呼籲，遵電影之涕泗縱橫，方合於逼眞之條件者，時希竊不謂然。夫一切美術之最高意境，以有跡臻於無跡，有象超於無象，乃爲名貴，平劇之優點，在能以抽象及寫意之方式，表演事實，使觀之者能以意會之，而有不盡之餘味，此中外人士之稍有戲劇知識者，類能瞭解之。（齊如山著「梅蘭芳游美記」中載之甚詳。）茍非然者，悉出之以寫實刻劃，則一　無餘，流於淺薄，便非美術矣。故余所希望於梅君者，表情當依舞台舊例，無事更張，昨與陳蒙庵敎授論此，亦力持此意、</p>
<p>（五）關於道具（俗稱切末），以爲遵用平劇原物，而加以精細則可，仍用馬鞭，甩髮等，而無須設門窗，不然，則各角之藝術無以表現。（如姜妙香君逃出金邦，有甩髮之絕藝，梅蘭芳君啓閉門窗，有極美之手式可顯。）又不合於平劇寫意之高尙原則，若一切必欲其象眞，則與連合本戲無以異，國人之有識者，且唾棄之矣。</p>
<p>（六）情節部分，生死恨已是屢經煆煉之名劇，無間言矣，惟程鵬舉韓玉娘之被據及配婚，在程鵬舉及張大戶之上塲詞中，雖皆有表白，然猶病其隱而不顯，聞由費穆君爲之另編數塲，加於前面，於張大戶役俘虜若犬羊，及程鵬舉關懷大志，不願就婚於　中之情，有所刻劃，此誠先得吾心者，嘗以吿於評劇家蘇少卿君，亦大稱善。</p>
<p>（七）梅君今年五十五歲，其畢生刻苦精煉之絕藝，茍得藉電影之力，以埀於永遠，爲後世楷模，此誠一大美事，然尺有所短，而智有所不逮，梅君於電影則未嘗有數十年之經驗也。若捨其平劇固有之絕藝，而强納於電影繩墨之中，則是楚材晋用，削足以適履矣。時希診病之餘，醉心平劇，爲維護平劇立言，竊期期以爲不可。生死恨劇本，茍合於電影體裁，則電影界合此身分者，豈遂無人，何必以梅君爲嘗試？竊爲梅君令名計，亦願當世愛梅諸公，覆　而善處之云。</p>

<p>本談日前載翼雲君一淸代試塲話弊」一文，記某狀元殿試書未畢，天已昏黑，某大臣命人燃紙燭之，得以完卷。所謂某狀元，卽吾鄉徐州李蟠（根大）也。蟠中康熙庚午科舉人，丁丑大魁天下，授翰林院修撰。當殿試日，懷餅以進，蟠長身黑面，文思素鈍，日將脯，文猶未就，殿上依例收卷，蟠求之日：畢生功名，在此舉矣。某大臣憐之，爲燃紙以燭，蟠出所懷餅，且啖且寫，終卷而出。聖祖微聞其事，曰：是亦苦心之士也。卷呈。因拔置第一。時人謂爲「懷餅狀元」。慈谿姜宸英，亦成是榜一甲三名進士。淸初沿明制，順天正主考以前一科一甲一名爲之，蟠依例主康熙己卯順天會試，宸英副之，榜發，御史鹿佑劾考試不公，事下，蟠遣戍，宸英牽連下吏，未置對，死獄中。宸英爲江南老名士，死時年七十餘矣。時人哀之，爲之語日：「老美未必眞辣，小李大有甜頭。」蟠死，歸葬徐州城南黑石峽，今戲馬合前有狀元府第，門額猶存，李氏族裔居其中，而式微甚矣。</p>

<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>在一八〇九年，美國第四任總統麥迪遜的太太的黑人女廚子薩蒂·喬生竟因發明冰淇淋而被控意圖毒害麥迪遜夫人的賓客，被捕下獄。</p>
<p>有一次，一個宴會突然的取消了，　蒂便將一些奶油蛋糕放入冰箱中冷却儲藏。兩天之後，另外一次宴會舉行了，她便將冰箱中的蛋糕端出來饗客，竟然未曾知曉它們早已凍結起來了。</p>
<p>有一個神經過敏的客人，剛嚐第一口便駭呌：「有毒！」急忙把冰蛋糕吐出來，並且要求逮捕廚子，結果薩蒂立卽寃枉的入獄了。其他的客人見了便騷然作鳥獸散。事後，麥迪遜夫人決會愼審的親自試驗蛋糕究竟有毒與否。她一口復一口的嘗着，對這種冰凍的蛋糕的滋味大加讚賞，於是她便運用權勢，將薩蒂保釋出來。</p>
<p>第二天，蕯蒂一同廚房便儘快的冰凍蛋糕，薪水一個月也加了五塊錢。這種原始的冰淇淋經麥迪遜夫人的介紹和推薦之後，在年終之前，華盛頓的每一個大使館於宴會中都有冰淇淋饗客了</p>
<p>但是，冰洪淋的眞正的起源還要早得多。當馬哥孛羅於六百年前從東方回到歐洲的時候，他帶去一張製造「冰水」的方子，這張方子在亞洲已經用過幾千年了。</p>
<p>卽使在今天，某些國家製造冰洪淋的方法還是與羅馬暴君尼羅的方法類似。尼羅派遣成羣的奴隸到山中去取冰和雪，用來冰他的美饌佳酒。在近代的羅馬尼亞，「冰人」們至今仍於冬季聲取冰塊，藏在坑中，上面覆以樹枝，到夏季再取出來使用。</p>
<p>在墨西哥城，天然冰壓倒了機製冰，那裏的冰來自當地的柏柏卡達比特山。在一萬五千呎的山峯上，終年積雪結冰，當地的人在上山舖了水管，每逢陽光最强烈的候時，雪冰便融化而由管一子下流到山邊的容器中。</p>
<p>等到日落，氣溫降低的時候，雪水在容器中又結成了冰，等下一次太陽再出來，人們將容器在太陽下稍微曝晒一下，使冰塊鬆動，然後傾倒出來，轍送到冰店裏去，冰店再將這種自然冰銷售給全城的冰淇淋店。</p>

<p>儒行稱儒者「道塗不爭險易之利，冬夏不爭陰陽之和」。蓋爭己所利必予人以不利、各求自利則無往而不爭矣。臨財不茍，見得思義，有德者能之，若爭小利以自私，賢者時亦不免。孔子舉此二事，以明儒行，言心不容僞，雖細行不失其守，方爲眞儒。修己觀人，於此等處加之意，自無失矣。或日，如孔氏之敎，必舉世皆君子而後可，否則惟使世間有利而無害，其爭自息，然此必無之事也。今日生存競爭之說，深入人心，言鬥言爭，不絕於耳，貫澈鬥爭主義者，於險易之利，陰陽之和，此而不爭，自居何所？言秩序者，大之欲以止絕戰禍，小之期免混亂，守秩序者亦或就範一時，稍有不平，爭端又起，此孔子之說，至今愈爲時人所攻擊也。有生則有爭，甚子寗不知之，所謂作易者之憂患，在於生生，生生不已，爭亦無窮，縱得小康，難致太平，此理易曉，孔子旣明言之。倘有不爭之道，使人善其生，人亦必樂由之矣。近時談儒學者甚衆，人類正苦於相爭，不知亦有作探本之論者否。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Situ Limen Announces Ten Plans in Washington to Assist Our Recovery; Second Batch of Industrial Component Funds Allocated at US$17.85 Million; Railways and Electricity Will Be Expanded and Smuggling Suppressed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[United States Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), 14th] Mr. Situ Limen, head of the U.S. ECA Investigation Team, announced ten new plans on the 13th at a Washington press conference to assist our economic recovery under the US$35 million ECA industrial component plan.  A total of US$17,850,000 has been tentatively allocated to each project. (The first batch of funds, US$4.4 million, was announced in Shanghai on September 1.)  This plan is extremely important to China's industrial production increase and economic stability.</p>
<p>The majority of the aforementioned total is designated for improving China's four major railways.  The Canton-Hankow Railway, the lifeline of South China's transportation, received US$5 million; the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway, which connects the Yangtze River basin and the Canton-Hankow Railway, received US$2.5 million; the Peiping-Tientsin Railway, which connects Peiping and Tientsin and transports coal from the Kailan mines, received US$1.5 million; and the Taiwan Railway, which surrounds western Taiwan, received US$1.5 million.</p>
<p>Situ Limen also announced five new electricity projects, among which the Nanjing Small Power Plant received US$2.5 million.  Peiping received US$2.5 million.  Next, the small power plants in Central and Southern China, run by the Resource Committee, received a total of US$2.5 million.  The power plants in Peiping, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang, and Tsingtao received US$2 million (including the funds previously announced for merging with the Peiping-Tientsin power grid).  The Hankow Power Plant received US$300,000, and the Chongqing Power Plant received US$250,000.  The tenth project announced by Situ Limen is for supplying components and equipment for Chinese customs to suppress smuggling, totaling US$1 million.  Situ emphasized the overall importance of the industrial component plan to China, stating that it will benefit every level of the Chinese people.  Situ also said that the industrial construction and component plan will make the most of the materials supplied to China by UNRRA.  Also, surplus U.S. military materials will be utilized as much as possible.  He also stated, "We are now preparing all steps to ensure that the materials and equipment supplied by the ECA can be guaranteed in procurement, transportation, and after arrival in China in terms of installation and effective use. We firmly believe that these items will not be left in warehouses or flow into non-productive channels due to a lack of proper preparation, financial arrangements, or supervision."</p>
<p>Situ and Yan Jia'gan are scheduled to return to China together within a week to carry out the final steps of implementing the industrial construction and component plan.  To date, the total industrial component funds that have been announced have reached US$22,250,000.  The remaining US$12,750,000 will be used for other components, possible material value-added, and other unforeseen needs.  The ECA's US$35 million industrial construction plan (US$35 million has already been allocated for component use, and the same amount will be used for industrial construction) is currently under discussion with the Chinese government.  The ECA hopes that Situ and Yan will be able to reach an agreement with the Chinese government upon their return to China.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Foreign Cotton for Yarn Exchange Standards Determined</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Cotton Subcommittee of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee held a meeting yesterday starting at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Wang Nianzu, Chen Shuzeng, Pan Jianliang, Rong Yixin, Wang Zijian, Liu Jianhua, Song Lifeng, Liu Wenteng, Dai De, Weite, etc., with Gu Yu chaired. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that the standard for the second batch of foreign cotton for yarn exchange will be that 20-count standard yarn will exchange for 70% of US cotton, 583.5 pounds. The plan will be implemented as soon as it is approved by the Joint Committee of U.S. Aid and the ECA. The second batch of cotton will be distributed immediately after the first batch of cotton is distributed. In addition, the committee's first batch of 69,528 bales of foreign cotton will be allocated as follows: 28,318 bales for the Textile Construction Company, 29,894 bales for the Six Districts Association (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai), 1,557 bales for the Seven Districts Association (Tianjin), 552 bales for the Nine Districts Association (Qingdao), 189 bales for Jardine Matheson (British), 470 bales for Lanchang (British), and 7,198 bales for other factories. The second batch of foreign cotton, totaling approximately 190,000 bales, will also be allocated proportionally based on the number of spindles in operation at each factory.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yu Hongjun Attends Kuomintang Memorial Week and Reports on U.S. Aid Utilization Work Based on Self-Reliance <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Yu Hongjun, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Yuan's U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, reported on the utilization of U.S. aid at the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week this morning. His original remarks were as follows:</p>
<p>Before reporting on the utilization of U.S. aid, I would like to first report on the purpose of U.S. aid utilization: The utilization of U.S. aid is based on the "Agreement between the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America regarding Economic Assistance," signed by the two parties on July 3rd of this year, which is the so-called bilateral agreement. The United States, based on its national policy, provides economic assistance to various self-reliant countries after the war. Therefore, it passed the Economic Assistance Act for European and Asian countries. Based on this act, the bilateral agreement between China and the U.S. was created. The preamble of the agreement briefly and concisely explains that because the Chinese government is determined to implement a self-help plan to stabilize the domestic economic situation, and the United States government is also providing economic assistance to the Chinese government and people in accordance with the provisions of its 1948 China Aid Act, the two parties negotiated the terms to promote this friendly international policy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the utilization of U.S. aid can be said to be based on self-reliance, with U.S. aid complementing it to promote its success. If we make good use of U.S. aid, it will certainly be easier to become self-reliant. The utilization of U.S. aid is based on the spirit of self-reliance. The entire U.S. aid program comes from self-reliance and must be implemented with the spirit of self-reliance. This is the meaning of the current U.S. economic assistance to China and is different from ordinary international reciprocity treaties or treaties for other purposes.</p>
<p>The colleagues of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, under the direction of Chairman Weng, follow the above principles in utilizing U.S. aid. We also coordinate with the current domestic financial and economic situation, focusing on key points and prioritizing based on urgency to ensure the proper utilization of funds. The purposes of utilizing U.S. aid are threefold: (1) to stabilize the economy in order to balance domestic income and expenditure; (2) to save foreign exchange reserves in order to balance international income and expenditure; and (3) to promote agricultural and industrial production in order to lay the foundation for economic recovery. In general, selling U.S. aid materials is a way to contract currency and balance domestic income and expenditure; transporting materials is a way to save foreign exchange and balance international income and expenditure; and formulating construction plans and assisting agricultural and industrial development are ways to promote production and revive the economy. Some of the above methods are aimed at long-term solutions for centuries to come, while others are aimed at addressing the current urgent problems and seeking solutions. The aforementioned items (1) and (2) are closer to symptomatic treatments, while item (3) is closer to fundamental treatment. In the current situation, symptomatic treatment is more urgent than fundamental treatment, but in terms of nature, fundamental treatment is certainly more important than symptomatic treatment. Therefore, most of the U.S. aid is used to stabilize the current economy, while encouraging production is also planned for concurrently, so that we can overcome difficulties, lay the foundation, and realize the principles of self-help, self-reliance, and regeneration.</p>
<p>Status of U.S. Aid Materials</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly report on the status of U.S. aid materials separately:</p>
<p>Important Contents of the Agreement: The full text of the Sino-U.S. Economic Assistance Agreement consists of twelve articles, and its content is quite extensive. The most important points are described below: (A) Our country promises to implement various self-help plans, such as the effective utilization of economic resources, the promotion of agricultural production development, the improvement of production and marketing, the stabilization of the currency and finances, and budget matters, in order to cooperate with U.S. aid and maximize the improvement of the economic situation. (B) The U.S. aid materials supplied shall be agreed upon by both China and the United States for processing and distribution. (C) Our government shall open a special account at the Central Bank and deposit the amount of U.S. dollars equivalent to the value of the materials supplied by the U.S. on a grant basis, in national currency, to be used for (1) the U.S. administrative expenses for implementing U.S. aid, (2) rural reconstruction funds, (3) domestic transportation costs for relief materials and packages, (4) freezing measures taken to stabilize the currency and finances, (5) expenditures to encourage production and develop new wealth, (6) expenditures to promote programs or plans, and (7) expenditures for relief and work relief programs under the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement that have not yet been completed. If there is a surplus as of April 3, 1949, the two governments will separately agree on how to spend it. (D) For materials that are lacking in U.S. resources but produced in our country, our country shall facilitate their transfer in accordance with the terms of sale, exchange, barter, or other methods agreed upon by the two governments.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, when the U.S. supplies materials on a grant basis, our country shall deposit the U.S. dollar cost of the materials into a special account at the Central Bank in national currency. This is tantamount to the government purchasing materials with national currency. Therefore, if the sales price of the materials cannot cover the original cost, and the funds allocated to the special account are not frozen as much as possible, then the various expenditures will require hundreds of millions of dollars, or even increase the national debt. This point is of utmost importance and must be given special attention to tighten up at any time in order to meet the purpose of stabilizing finance and economy.</p>
<p>Time Limit for the Use of Special Funds</p>
<p>The amount of U.S. aid to China is US$275 million for the economic portion, of which US$215 million is a grant and US$60 million is a loan. The agreed allocation of the grant portion is as follows: (1) US$70 million for food, (2) US$70 million for cotton, (3) US$50 million for oil, (4) US$13.8 million for fertilizer, (5) US$10 million for industrial supplementary equipment, and (6) US$1.2 million for U.S. administrative expenses. The total is US$215 million. The loan portion is US$60 million for the Industrial Construction Plan.</p>
<p>According to the law, the above-mentioned materials and special funds for construction plans have a time limit from April of this year to March of next year, which is one year. For the sake of convenience, the appropriation time will be divided into four phases, each lasting three months. (Continued on page 2)</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun arrived in Shanghai by Northwest Airlines flight from Tokyo at 1:20 PM yesterday, accompanied by his wife and advisor Shao Yulin. Zhang was immediately surrounded by the welcoming crowd after disembarking. Chiang Ching-kuo, Fang Zhi, Chen Guolian, Zhang Jiaju, and others who were waiting at the scene rushed forward to shake hands and express their joy. Zhang was wearing a dark blue tweed suit with stripes. After three weeks in Japan, his complexion was noticeably darker, but he was in good spirits and did not appear tired. When reporters rushed forward to ask him to make a statement, he laughed and said, "I have already made many statements in Japan. Now, I am in a hurry and have nothing else to say." When a reporter asked him about the problems of Japan's relationship with India and the U.S. support for Japan, he replied, "Today, I cannot answer any questions. If I have any statements, I will make them publicly and will never make them to any reporter alone." After speaking, he left the airport with his wife and Zhang Jiaju in the same car.</p>
<p>According to someone close to Zhang, Zhang will stay in Shanghai for about one or two days and then go to Nanjing to report to the central government on his visit to Japan. His statement to the press may be made in Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Finance Minister Wang Scheduled to Fly to the U.S. to Preside Over International Development Bank Board Meeting and Seek Construction Loans <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Board of Governors meeting for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is scheduled to be held in the United States on the 27th of this month. As the chairmanship of this meeting is to be rotated to our country's Finance Minister, our Finance Minister Wang Yunwu has decided to personally attend the meeting in the United States. He is scheduled to travel by night train from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 20th, and fly to the United States on the 22nd. Only Song Ziliang and one or two others will accompany Wang. Song, as an alternate director of the IBRD, will participate in the meeting as an alternate director. In addition to presiding over the IBRD Board of Governors meeting, Wang will also take the opportunity to propose loans for reconstruction and development. After the currency reforms in France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Luxembourg, these four countries all received loans from the bank. With our country's currency reform and the prospect of economic stability, we can also hope to follow their example and submit an application for loans. It is reported that Wang will stay in the United States for two weeks, during which time the affairs of the Ministry of Finance will be temporarily handled by Political Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Legislative Yuan Continues to Hold Closed-Door Meetings; President Weng and Others Attend to Answer Questions; Finance Minister Wang Says Leak of Secrets Was Due to Careless Hiring <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Legislative Yuan held its second closed-door session at 9:00 AM on the 13th to continue questioning about the emergency financial and economic measures, with more than 300 members in attendance. Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Sun Yueqi, and Agricultural Vice Minister Xie Chengyu were all present. President Sun attended with illness and presided over the meeting. Members who spoke included Liu Youchen, Liu Mingyang, Hou Shaowen, Chen Shaoxian, Zheng Zhenyu, Wu Shipeng, Yang Baolin, Huang Shaozi (read on his behalf), Zou Shuwen, Shen Chongyu, Zhou Yongneng, Wang Dezhen, and Dong Wei. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon. The afternoon session resumed at 3:00 PM with more than 200 members in attendance. President Sun was excused due to illness, and Wang Qijiang was elected as chairman. Members Duan Jianmin, Yang Dagian, Pi Dezhong, Lian Mou, Ye Daoyuan, Miao Qiping, Li Yu, Zhang Ziqu, and others spoke successively. During the members' questioning, many valuable opinions were expressed. The case of the Ministry of Finance's leak of secrets was also mentioned. At 5:40 PM, in addition to those who had switched to written submissions, there were still dozens of people who had not had a chance to speak. After the chairman sought the opinions of the members, it was unanimously passed that those who had not yet spoken would switch to written questions.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Wang Yunwu's Reply <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Finance Minister Wang then gave a reply. Wang first expressed his gratitude for the valuable opinions of the members, and said, "I should not only reply verbally and in writing in the short term, but also reply with facts." This remark immediately earned a round of applause. He continued, saying that the budget revenue and expenditure for the second half of the year could be offset. The issuance of 2 billion Gold Yuan, compared with the 1.6 billion legal tender issued by the central government before the war in 1937 and the 400 million provincial currency, totaled 2 billion, which was obviously not a large number. The reason why eight-ninths of the budget for the six months of the second half of this year was used up in July and August was in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget Act. In the future, with the stability of the currency value, the reduction in the rate of currency circulation, and the stability of prices, the budget can be balanced. Regarding the salt tax increase, Wang said that the government was very sorry, but in order to balance the budget, it was adjusted according to the price index in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget Act, and the government had no intention of ignoring the Legislative Yuan's resolution. As for the salaries of public school teachers, the government originally intended to adjust them after reducing redundant personnel in order to balance the budget, but was afraid of creating unemployment problems. However, they are not increased at present, and there is still a possibility of increasing them in the future. Regarding the leak of secrets by senior officials of the Ministry of Finance, Wang repeatedly made a "frank explanation," saying that it was only "careless hiring." He himself was indeed responsible for preventing the leakage of secrets, and he also personally assisted in the arrest after the incident. Wang concluded by saying that his personal decision to stay or leave was entirely based on the interests of the country. If the country does not need him to serve as Finance Minister, he will resign immediately. If he is still needed, he can only do his best. (Applause).</p>
<h3 id="e7">Yu Hongjun's Reply <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Next, President Yu Hongjun replied: (1) Commercial banks must have reserve funds when issuing cashier's checks. If it is found that the reserve funds are insufficient and cannot be cashed, the license will be revoked immediately. (2) The matter of wealthy families obtaining foreign exchange illegally has been thoroughly investigated by the Control Yuan in advance, and a report has been issued. (3) Someone mentioned the Yangtze Electric Company. In fact, the company is not the Shanghai Yangtze Export Company. He concluded by saying that at the beginning of the reform, the Central Bank had many shortcomings, and he hoped that the members would give more guidance (applause).</p>
<h3 id="e8">Weng Wenhao's Reply <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Finally, President Weng gave a reply. First, he explained the handling of the case of the leak of secrets by officials of the Ministry of Finance, and then explained several points: (1) The grain rationing system in the five major cities is being implemented in accordance with the established policies of the previous Executive Yuan. Although there are difficulties, there are many advantages and it has continued value. (2) The government is actively rectifying the handling of enemy and puppet properties, which can be sold to enrich the national treasury. (3) People can openly report foreign exchange at home and abroad and foreign assets, and the government welcomes this assistance. (4) The deadline for the purchase of gold, silver, and foreign exchange (September 30) will be the end, and the credit of the Gold Yuan will be further enhanced at that time. At 6:30 PM, Weng's reply also ended in applause, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Vice President Li Zongren and his wife took the Qianhao train from Nanjing to Wuxi for a short trip this morning.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Wuxi, 13th] Vice President Li and his wife arrived in Wuxi from Nanjing this morning. After getting off the train, they went directly to the Lilan Lake Mountain Villa to rest. In order to avoid disturbing the local people, Li's itinerary was kept very secret beforehand, so very few people knew about it.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, who is about to attend the United Nations General Assembly, made a brief speech on the United Nations issue at a farewell party held by the British Alumni Association at around 4:00 PM on the 13th. Wang first expressed his regret that the United Nations had not been able to find solutions to some basic problems for more than two years. Such basic problems as the use of the veto power by the five permanent members, the control of atomic energy, and the establishment of international armed forces have not been resolved, resulting in today's dangerous world situation. Wang also emphasized that the current situation is similar to that of 1939, which is quite worrying. Wang said that he intends to try a new approach this time, as he represents our country at the meeting, so as to seek a way to restore the credibility of the General Assembly. Wang then said that he would also like to take the opportunity to visit England, but he does not yet know whether he can achieve his wish. As for the purpose of his visit to England, Wang said that the current world trends are communism and capitalism, which are going to extremes. However, Britain is following a third path, adopting moderate socialism. In today's world politics, Britain clearly has an important position. He believes that Britain's policy can coincide with our country's ideals, so he has the wish to visit England.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Ambassador Zhao Bingyu, the personal representative of the Korean President, and the members of the delegation paid respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at around 9:00 AM this morning, and visited scenic spots such as Linggu Temple, Tan Tomb, and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.

<h3 id="e17">Foreign Deputy Minister Yieh Kung-chao Discusses the South Korean Representative Issue <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] Foreign Deputy Minister Yieh Kung-chao told reporters on the evening of the 13th: "Now that the South Korean government has been formally established, the Chinese government will naturally recognize the official diplomatic representative it sends. However, before the establishment of the South Korean government, the Chinese government obviously had no way to recognize any national group representing the Korean people." Mr. Yieh made these remarks in response to reporters' questions after meeting with Ambassador Cho Byung-ok, the private representative of the South Korean President, at 3:30 p.m. to hear his request to revoke the recognition of the South Korean delegation. According to Mr. Cho, who, upon arriving in Nanjing on the 12th, involved Kim Gu and the current South Korean delegation in Nanjing when addressing reporters, the head of the delegation, Min Seok-rin, issued a statement on the afternoon of the 13th to refute him. The statement said, "The remarks made by Representative Cho Byung-ok to reporters, as published in various newspapers on the 13th, contain many misunderstandings and improprieties regarding this delegation, which must be corrected. Mr. Cho completely failed to understand the history of this delegation and the reasons why it has continued to operate until now, and he abruptly told reporters that he would ask Foreign Minister Wang to revoke recognition of this delegation, which is deeply regrettable. This delegation has been established for more than three years since the return of the provisional government to the country, and its mission has been well known to the Chinese government and people from all walks of life. With the establishment of our country's government, this delegation's mission was completed, and it was originally intended to be dissolved. However, on August 11, this delegation received a telegram from President Lee, instructing it to temporarily continue its operations, so it obeyed the order to postpone the dissolution. Mr. Cho's remarks about revoking recognition of this delegation are completely baseless and absurd. Mr. Cho came to China as a representative of the country and made such undignified remarks, which are extremely inappropriate. The above is not a personal attack on Mr. Cho; his remarks to reporters were so false and improper that they had to be corrected." Mr. Cho then issued a statement in response to this statement in the evening, saying, "The 'Korean Delegation' is an unofficial body, but its name is misleading and easily leads people to believe that it can represent the Korean government. The Korean government will soon appoint an official representative to China, but until this happens, any temporary delegation in China should not be recognized as representing the Korean government." He said that he had conveyed this intention to Foreign Deputy Minister Yieh Kung-chao when he met with him in the afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Supplementary Points for Cracking Down on Hoarding <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>There are three types of laws and regulations regarding cracking down on hoarding: (1) the "Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times," which were ordered to be re-applied in February of the 36th year [1947]; (2) the "Implementation Precautions for the Above-mentioned Measures," which were drafted and promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in January of this year; and (3) the "Supplementary Points for the Above-mentioned Measures," which were recently passed by the Executive Yuan and ordered by the Executive Yuan to be implemented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>The so-called supplementary measures consist of seven articles, the full text of which has already appeared in this newspaper on the 11th. The supplementary points are four:</p>
<p>(1) Goods needed for the business operations of merchants in this industry shall not exceed one-quarter of the annual need (except for seasonal goods);</p>
<p>(2) Implement warehouse inspections at designated locations;</p>
<p>(3) Fines of less than 1,000 Legal Tender Yuan are changed to fines of less than 1,000 Gold Yuan;</p>
<p>(4) The competent authority for implementing these laws and regulations, in municipalities and provincial capitals, in addition to the Bureau of Social Affairs or the Department of Social Affairs, will "handle cases jointly with public security and police agencies."</p>
<p>The above points two, three, and four are all natural measures adapted to the facts. The more novel point is the first point, that is, seasonal inventory can be excluded from the annual business needs limit, which can be said to be a balance between legal regulations and commercial information, and is naturally welcome to merchants.</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to provide additional explanations to the authorities: (1) Outdated goods, that is, styles, colors, and varieties that are no longer fashionable and cannot be sold in time, are especially prominent in fast-changing metropolitan areas. (2) Slow-selling goods, such as cement and machinery, have accumulated inventories that are difficult to clear. (3) Unpopular goods, such as books and instruments, have sales that cannot be achieved by one-sided promotion. Therefore, we believe that the scope of the proviso for seasonal goods is still too narrow.</p>
<p>Some people believe that these supplementary points are intended to supplement the crackdown on hoarding of important daily necessities, and their scope is limited to food, clothing, fuel, daily necessities, and other important daily necessities designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and has nothing to do with other goods. If this interpretation can be followed during the implementation, we also consider it very appropriate.</p>
<p>The second item of the supplementary points stipulates that the finished products and goods stored by factories and shops should be supplied and sold as much as possible and should not exceed the price limit. However, there is no quantity limit on the raw materials stored in the factory, only that the output, purchase, sales, and inventory (finished products, raw materials, and important materials) should be reported together when submitting the monthly report. This is also a commendable thing. Because raw materials are the basis for factory re-production, the more abundant the reserves, the more guaranteed the production. Now that it is taken out of the scope of hoarding that should be cracked down on, it cannot be said to be a very wise move. However, we still hope that hoarding by non-merchants or non-industry merchants will be strictly cracked down on according to law in order to reduce costs and increase supply. Judging from the past situation, non-industry people monopolizing raw materials and shirking responsibility are obviously an important factor in raising prices and suppressing manufacturers! And the factory itself should not accumulate raw materials for production needs within the scope of crackdown.</p>
<p>The hoarding behavior referred to in the crackdown measures is conditional on large-scale purchases and storage, but what number is considered a large amount? This question was not clearly explained until the promulgation of the "Precautions", that is, "any amount exceeding one-fifth to one-third of the annual need is considered a large amount." However, the first item of the supplementary points issued this time stipulates that "it shall not exceed one-quarter of the annual need", which is inconsistent before and after. Fortunately, the lower paragraph of the same article still has the provision that "the limit for crackdown shall be determined by the local competent authority... based on the above standards... taking into account the supply and demand situation at any time." During the implementation, it should be considered and changed according to the situation, and do not stick to the one-quarter standard in order to promote the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>The so-called crackdown measures and precautions are not without shortcomings. For example, speculative behavior is originally conditional on raising prices above legal profits (Article 3 of the crackdown measures), but the legal profits of each goods are not consistent, and how to distinguish them is not an easy task. Also, if the goods that should be sold at a limited price cannot be sold by the deadline, the material management or fair-price supply and marketing agency shall purchase them at a fair price (Article 12 of the same measures). Until today, we have not seen this material management or fair-price supply and marketing agency able to cooperate. This is an implementation problem, not a legislative problem, but if it is not feasible in practice, it seems better to directly amend it.</p>
<p>Regarding various economic laws and regulations, due to the environmental factors at the time of promulgation, they are inevitably piecemeal and random, and they are dealt with at any time, and there is no consistent policy, resulting in many repetitions and contradictions. The various points mentioned above are still relatively minor problems. We very much hope that the competent department will pay more attention to the work of sorting out laws and regulations, because the implementation of all policies still depends on the law as a standard. If the laws and regulations have shortcomings and loopholes, it will inevitably make the executors feel a lot of difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e19">National Austerity and Construction Movement Outline Draft Submitted to the President for Review Economic and Spiritual Collaboration Development and Transformation of Society <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The "National Austerity and Construction Movement Outline" initiated under the leadership of the President has been drafted by Huang Shao-gu, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and others designated to be responsible for it. After several meetings, the draft has now been completed and submitted to the President for review. It is expected to be promulgated and implemented in the near future. According to a reporter's investigation, this outline is similar to the New Life Movement, but its scope is broader. It can also be said to be the embodiment of the New Life Movement, the National Spiritual Mobilization, and the National Economic Construction Movement. Diligence in production refers to the positive aspect, and frugality in consumption refers to the negative aspect. Production is economic, and thrift is spiritual. The two complement each other and develop together as a social movement. It can also be said to be a social transformation movement. The full text of the outline is divided into three parts: one is to explain the needs of the current era, the second is the mission of national construction, and the third is the covenant. According to Minister Peng Zhao-xian, who jointly drafted the case, the movement focuses on creating a trend and avoiding the formalism of the past. It does not specifically establish an agency to be in charge of it. Although the advocacy is in the President, it still needs the assistance and expansion of local public opinion agencies and social figures to ensure that this movement can be effectively promoted and achieve results, and that it is automatic for each other, then the future can be optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Nickel Coin Case in Kunming and Chengdu Interview with Person in Charge of National Bank Delay in Announcement May Be Due to Practical Difficulties <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] Regarding the case of the Kunming and Chengdu branches of the Central Bank delaying the announcement of the resumption of the use of nickel coins and taking the opportunity to make profits, the person in charge of the National Bank said yesterday: According to reports, the Kunming and Chengdu branches of the Bank, after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, delayed the announcement for several days regarding the conversion of the old nickel coins into Gold Yuan notes and the resumption of circulation, causing a buying spree of nickel coins in the market, taking the opportunity to make profits, and disrupting the financial market. There is suspicion of perfunctorily selling their jobs and engaging in corruption. The provincial councils of Yunnan and Sichuan have respectively reported the case and telegraphed the central government to thoroughly investigate and punish it. Regarding the part of the case involving private corruption, in addition to the central government paying close attention to the investigation, the head office attaches great importance to it and is now sending people to thoroughly investigate it. It is believed that there will be facts to investigate. Before the truth is clarified, the head office does not intend to express any opinions. However, the head office believes that there may be practical difficulties in delaying the announcement of the resumption of the use of auxiliary coins. The reason is that the Bank announced the issuance of Gold Yuan auxiliary currency notes and auxiliary coins on August 20 and telegraphed it to the branches in various places at the same time. At that time, because the full text was too long and the content was complicated, and there were many branch units, it had to send a summary telegram, so the branches in various places, after receiving the telegram, did not dare to announce it immediately due to the lack of clarity on the technical details of the issuance of Gold Yuan currency, and repeatedly telegraphed the head office for clarification. Therefore, the exchange of telegrams inevitably took some time, and such important telegrams were different from ordinary commercial telegrams because the codes were dense and translation took time. The translators also needed to be particularly careful, so the time for translating telegrams was longer than that of ordinary telegrams. Therefore, whether the Kunming and Chengdu branches deliberately delayed the announcement of the issuance of auxiliary coins needs to be determined after a thorough investigation. As for whether there was any opportunistic corruption before the announcement period, it is a matter of fact and can be thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 13th] The tram, which is the only means of transportation in the Beiping city area, was finally defeated by the students in exile on the 13th. The tram stopped all day on the 13th. More than 700 machinists originally planned to carry 27 injured machinists in a parade this morning and go to the Suppression General's Office and the Municipal Government to petition. However, due to public security issues, the company authorities persuaded them to give up. As for the resumption of work, the workers proposed that the government must be able to guarantee their safety before they can resume work. Later, Gao Zaitian, the managing director of the company, went to the Municipal Government to discuss the matter. It was decided that each shift would add one policeman to suppress the situation, and each major station would add several policemen to maintain order. In addition, two patrol cars would be dispatched regularly to patrol the tram lines. The workers have reluctantly accepted this and resumed traffic at 6 p.m. According to news from the company, the students not only beat the machinists on the tram, but even went to the machinists' homes to beat them. The workers are very angry about this. If it is not handled properly in the future, the consequences will be very serious.</p>

Among the above items, the food item can purchase about 9,000 tons of flour and about 67,000 tons of rice, about 70,000 bales of cotton, about 10,420 tons of fertilizer, and the oil item is mainly fuel oil, worth more than 2.9 million US dollars, followed by diesel, worth more than 1.7 million US dollars, followed by gasoline for vehicles, worth more than 1 million US dollars, and the remaining aviation gasoline, kerosene, lubricating oil, crude oil, etc., worth more than 2 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Second phase: From July to September of this year, the total amount of expenditure was US$71.2 million, allocated as follows: (1) US$6.5 million for food, (2) US$41.7 million for cotton, (3) US$14 million for oil, (4) US$4 million for fertilizer, and (5) US$5 million for industrial equipment. Among the above items, the food item can purchase about 9,000 tons of flour and 22,000 tons of rice, and more than 232,000 bales of cotton; for the fertilizer item, technical experts are consulting with the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration to jointly discuss the procurement and distribution methods; the oil demand has been estimated, and the quantity to be purchased in the second phase has been calculated. The request has been submitted to the US Economic Cooperation Administration by the US Economic Branch and the delegation led by our technical team, and is awaiting approval; the industrial equipment item can only be handled after the construction plan proposed by the Stuart Leighton investigation team has been approved.</p>
<p>Third phase: The appropriations for the third phase from October to December of this year and the fourth phase from January to March of next year, including construction funds, total US$167.3 million, of which about US$100 million can be used to purchase materials. How this fund will be distributed in stages is being discussed by both parties.</p>
<p>As of August 31, the materials shipped in the first and second phases included 65,730 long tons of rice and 8,939 long tons of flour. The materials being shipped included 11,168 long tons of rice and 8,961 long tons of flour. Of the rice shipped, 61,746 long tons have been delivered to the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee for distribution and sale in Shanghai, and 2,685 long tons in Guangzhou, including 1,500 long tons in Shantou. The amount sold by the Shanghai People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee is 37,263.80 long tons, and the actual price received is 2,339,302.95 Gold Yuan. For the cotton item, the US has agreed to transfer the funds from the two phases to pay for the US cotton that the China Textile Construction Company originally ordered and has been shipped to Shanghai. The first phase of cotton, 69,878 bales, is in the process of customs clearance. The second phase of cotton, more than 232,000 bales allocated under the US aid program, has been issued a payment notice by the US and can also be cleared through customs. For the oil item, the intention is also to transfer the funds from the two phases to pay for the oil that has arrived in Shanghai. After the US approves and the payment procedures are completed, the goods can be picked up.</p>
<p>Methods of Using Materials</p>
<p>The methods of using various materials are briefly described as follows: (A) The utilization of rice and flour will continue to follow the method of supplying and distributing rice in major port cities. At present, in addition to the five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, Qingdao is also temporarily included. The above measures can reduce the supply of rice from domestic rice-producing areas to the above-mentioned major cities, making the price of food in the interior gradually stabilize. At the same time, the sales income can be transferred to support agriculture and industry, so that all relevant areas can benefit from US aid. However, the proposed distribution price should be close to the market price. If the selling price is too low, it will be equivalent to providing relief to a portion of the people, which seems unfair. At the same time, if the income decreases, the benefits of utilization will also be reduced. However, according to US estimates, all US aid food is only enough for the allocation of the above-mentioned major cities by more than 40%, so if the distribution is implemented, the remaining 60% must be provided by our government itself. The quantity of US aid food that can be purchased may not be able to fully meet our hopes due to world food quotas and harvest seasons. At the same time, the timing of the US aid portion and the portion provided by our government must also be taken into account. Therefore, the food distribution problem is still being discussed and planned by the committee and the competent department at any time in order to find a solution. (B) Cotton According to recent estimates, from July of this year to March of next year, within nine months, the amount of raw cotton in my country's textile industry will be about 900,000 to 950,000 bales short. The US cotton obtained under the US aid program is only 360,000 bales, which is still 600,000 bales short. In order to remedy this, the funds for US aid cotton should be managed in a way that allows them to circulate and be used to maintain production. The Cotton Committee has agreed on the following distribution principles: (1) cotton is exchanged for yarn or cloth; (2) half of the exchanged yarn and cloth are exported, and half are sold domestically; (3) the foreign exchange obtained from the export of yarn and cloth is jointly managed by the US Aid Association and the US Economic Branch to exchange for cotton or related supplies to maintain domestic production. Regarding the ratio of cotton to yarn, it has been discussed many times and a compromise has been reached. In the first phase, 599 pounds of cotton will be exchanged for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. The first phase of US cotton, 69,878 bales, can be delivered to the Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Joint Transportation Office for distribution to various spinning mills within days.

<h3 id="e29">The Berlin Problem Remains Unresolved: The Three Powers Plan to Force a Showdown with the Soviets; Three Envoys to Visit the Kremlin Again Today; If Negotiations Fail, Resolution Will Be Submitted to the UN General Assembly <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 13th (Broadcast from Moscow): The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting at the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union this morning to consider the report from Cythot, foreign affairs advisor to the French military governor Koenig, who returned from Berlin after discussions with the four governors. The three envoys, recognizing that their next meeting would be the final juncture, sought to ensure adequate preparation beforehand to align their views. It is therefore anticipated that the three envoys will not visit the Kremlin tonight, the 13th. Western observers suggest the three envoys might visit the Kremlin on the 14th.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 13th] United Press learned on the 13th that the instructions prepared by the Western three powers in London and delivered to the three envoys in Moscow have been finalized. Their content "amounts to a demand for a showdown in direct negotiations in Moscow." The three envoys will explain to the Soviet Union that the West has become impatient with Soviet perfidy and will not allow such a fruitless approach to continue. This is not an appeal to Stalin; in fact, the strong tone of these instructions borders on an ultimatum, although Western diplomats are still reluctant to use that term. It is understood that the instructions explicitly state that the procedures agreed upon by Stalin and the Western envoys in Moscow, and the orders sent by the Soviet government to Sokolovsky, differ greatly in spirit and content. According to the original agreement, by this point, the Berlin Conference should have reached an agreement, paving the way for a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the global situation caused by Germany, ultimately leading to a relaxation of tensions in Europe. Conversely, the Berlin blockade remains in place, the situation is deteriorating, the overall condition is worsening, and the inevitable breakdown of negotiations is causing an "extraordinarily serious situation." With the West determined to adopt a new strategy in Moscow, the prospect of progress remains uncertain. Therefore, the purpose of the three-power discussions in London is to draft a countermeasure to deal with the situation should the Moscow talks collapse. Britain and France are both reluctant to refer the matter to the United Nations, asserting that they should deal with Moscow with extreme patience and insist on direct negotiations. Now that patience is nearing exhaustion, it is widely believed that the three countries have agreed in principle to submit the case to the UN General Assembly on September 21. It is particularly emphasized here that the Western three powers have decided on their course of action after the failure of final measures, "and are completely united." A Western spokesman said, "There is no doubt about our firm attitude. This is not an appeal to Stalin. The situation has gone far beyond that point. It is now a showdown." Moscow may now recognize that the opinions expressed by Stalin and Molotov in Moscow are quite incompatible with Sokolovsky's actions in Berlin. The general public is extremely pessimistic about the entire situation. Public opinion is increasingly alarmed by the stalemate in the Berlin talks. Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to issue a comprehensive statement on the progress of the negotiations. It is believed here that the Moscow talks should not be allowed to flounder as they have in the past, so the West is informing the Soviet Union in the most direct language that the time has come. An external spokesman said, "The Western three powers have agreed on the next step regarding the Berlin situation," but did not disclose the nature of the "next step," but said that relevant news would be released soon. The spokesman also said that it was not the case that the three countries had previously disagreed, but that in the early stages of negotiations, it was of course impossible for the three countries to be absolutely identical. The "Committee of Three" in London does not plan to hold a meeting on the 13th, but the French Ambassador Massigli has had talks with external officials.</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Soviet Union Plans to Use the Old Trick Against Czechoslovakia; Attempt to Usurp Political Power in Berlin; Using Balloons and Anti-Aircraft Guns to Obstruct Anglo-American Airlifts <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 13th] A British-licensed newspaper reported on the 13th that Soviet leaders have drafted a plan to have communist action groups seize political power in Berlin on a specific date designated "Day X," after the U.S. presidential election in November. Prior to this, official reports indicated that the Soviet Union, in addition to conducting air force exercises, is using anti-aircraft fire, blocking balloons, and strong, dazzling searchlights to obstruct the American airlift to Berlin. The American newspaper "Monday Echo" claims that the Soviet Union is currently launching a provocative campaign, and then, under the pretext of maintaining order, will come forward to seize power.</p>
<p>It also stated that Soviet officials told the Communist Party that the Soviet Union does not intend to reach an agreement with Western countries regarding Berlin or Germany, "as this would hinder the process of the people's democratic state transforming into a proletarian dictatorship." The newspaper stated, "The Communist Party will do its utmost to exacerbate the situation in Berlin, and then, under the pretext of having the actual responsibility of protecting public order, will conceal its conspiracy to seize power." It further stated that the Berlin action group will be organized in the manner of the Czech action group in February.</p>

<p>(Continued from Page Two) (C) The method of oil utilization has now been agreed upon: (1) The current quota and extra-quota import system will continue. (2) The current allocation methods for aviation fuel, diesel, and fuel oil will continue. (3) The quantitative allocation of gasoline for automobiles in Shanghai will continue in the current manner, and the same will be done in other places. (4) Kerosene, engine oil, lubricating oil, etc., will now be sold by oil companies through their agents. (5) The selling price will be determined with reference to cost and exchange rates, ensuring that it is realistic and taking into account the costs of public utilities. (6) Oil importers are allowed to operate U.S. aid oil, but they must comply with the principle of supply economics. Once customs declaration, oil withdrawal, and price determination are completed, implementation is planned accordingly. It is also estimated that 60% of U.S. aid oil will be supplied to transportation and public utilities, and the remaining 40% will be used for general consumption. (D) Fertilizer: Of the 100,000 tons of U.S. aid fertilizer, the following distribution methods have only been decided: (1) Approximately 40,000 tons of fertilizer will be sold on the Chinese mainland through private merchants. (2) A quantity of no more than 10,000 tons of fertilizer will be reserved for use by the Chinese Rural Reconstruction Commission. The plan will be submitted by the association to the Economic Cooperation Administration for review in October. (3) Approximately 50,000 tons of fertilizer will be temporarily reserved for purchasing rice in Taiwan for emergency food storage. (4) If the fertilizer reserved in the second or third item is not used effectively and there is a surplus, it will be sold through private merchants. (5) Fertilizer is exclusively for food production, and priority should be given to rice production. The above is the most recent decision made by both parties, but in order to facilitate implementation, the first batch of fertilizer will be concentrated in Taiwan for a trial run.</p>
<p>Regarding the U.S. aid to our reconstruction and construction plan, it was originally planned to lend US$60 million specifically for reconstruction and construction, plus US$10 million for industrial supplementary equipment, which belonged to the aforementioned donation item. After the Stoolman investigation team conducted a wide-ranging industrial survey and research, it was believed that the greatest current need of our country's industry was the accessories required for industry. Therefore, the industrial equipment accessories and the reconstruction and construction special funds were changed to US$35 million each, reducing the number of loans and increasing the number of donations. , which is more convenient for me. Among the various applications for assistance, we are trying our best to select appropriate targets, and the following have been selected: (1) Kailan Mining Bureau, (2) Yangzi Power Company, (3) Tianjin Power Plant, (4) Taiwan Sugar Company. The four units are the first recipients of assistance, and the amount of assistance totals US$4.4 million, because the above four companies occupy an important position in our country's industry and are closely related to people's livelihoods, so they should be assisted first. As for continued assistance and how to distribute it, the government has sent Yan Jiagan, a member of the committee, together with Stu Li Men to fly to the United States on the 4th of this month to participate in the meeting of the US Economic Cooperation Administration to discuss and make a decision.</p>
<p>Organization of the Utilization Committee</p>
<p>Here is a brief report on the organization of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee. The U.S. Aid Utilization Committee is subordinate to the Executive Yuan. In addition to the committee working in cooperation with the U.S. Economic Cooperation Branch in Beijing and Shanghai, offices are also set up in Ping, Tianjin, Qing, and Sui. In view of the fact that the organizational structure of several material processing agencies in the past was huge and the expenses were huge, we strive to be compact and flexible. , only as a decision-making and supervisory implementation agency, and not directly involved in business. All imported materials are sold by the competent authorities, (for example, food is entrusted to local civil food allocation committees for storage and sale), so the number of people in all departments, offices, offices and subcommittees below the committee is less than 200, and their treatment is in accordance with the government's promulgated public servants' treatment methods, which are no different from those of employees of general state-owned enterprises, and most of the staff at all levels are borrowed from relevant institutions, so the expenses are not large. For this reason, the U.S. government established the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration to contact the U.S. aid affairs with European and Asian aid-receiving countries. The Chinese Branch of the U.S. Resident Office is presided over by Mr. Lai Louhan. Our committee maintains close contact with the Chinese Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and has held joint meetings. In order to cooperate with the U.S. measures, we have sent a technical delegation to the U.S. capital to contact the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and other institutions at any time. In addition, the US Aid Association will join forces with relevant and competent agencies to form food, cotton, petroleum and other subcommittees to hold regular meetings to review the material distribution policies and related issues.</p>
<p>The above report gives a general overview of the use of U.S. aid. Before the report concludes, I would like to specifically mention the government's self-help plan in coordination with U.S. aid. During Dean Zhang's tenure, the Ten Guidelines for Self-Help have been promulgated. Now, Dean Weng has announced new economic measures, issued new currency, and promulgated emergency financial measures. All of the above are ironclad evidence of the government's implementation of a strong self-help plan in accordance with bilateral agreements. , which is also a very effective way to coordinate U.S. aid and stabilize the economy. We firmly believe that self-reliance combined with U.S. aid, and U.S. aid will help achieve self-reliance, is the true meaning of U.S. aid. Today we are facing the most serious juncture. Under the great goal of suppressing bandits and quelling the chaos, both military and economic affairs have become critical to success or failure. The dynamics of the economy directly affect the daily lives of every citizen. The importance of U.S. aid today is self-evident. Please comrades, give more supervision so that this U.S. aid can achieve the best results.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Long-Term Stabilization of Prices; Strive to Increase Production; Important Meeting of the Management and Supervision Office <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Management and Supervision Office held an extremely important internal meeting yesterday afternoon, personally presided over by Chiang Ching-kuo, with many experts and key personnel in attendance. According to attendees: the discussions were not about the branch technical problems of implementation, but about the direction of the entire economic control. The most important point is that for the long-term stability of prices, Shanghai's production not only needs to continue, but also needs to be expanded. The "August 19" price limit decision will be maintained, but if, due to the price limit, there is a work stoppage or factory closures, the state will take over to ensure that production can continue. The raw materials currently stored in factories can be maintained without difficulty for one or two years. The problem is that some factories would rather hoard raw materials than produce, and this must be corrected. Secondly, foreign exchange and import policies were also discussed in detail at the meeting. It was deeply felt that most of our country's past imports were luxury goods such as private cars and nylon stockings, which were an unnecessary waste of national foreign exchange. In the future, we will import as much production equipment as possible. If the operators suffer losses as a result, the government can provide subsidies if necessary. Regarding the implementation of comprehensive rationing, there have been many discussions in the past, but it has not yet been materialized. The current first step is to use the power of the government to make the supply of daily necessities more and more sufficient. In the future, the attitude towards industry and commerce is to crack down on excessive profits and protect its legitimate profits. Therefore, in addition to maintaining the continued production of large industries, it will fully support small and medium-sized enterprises. The above points were only discussed on the original plan at the meeting, and detailed implementation plans will be formulated later.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The third session of the seventh general meeting of the City Council was held at 3:50 p.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the council. One hundred and forty-six councilors were present, and Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Shen, and more than 20 heads of bureaus and departments attended. Yesterday's meeting discussed various proposals on finance, police affairs, public works, land administration, and proposals submitted by the speaker and the mayor, as well as the budget and final accounts committee. The entire process was smooth, and most of the proposals were successfully passed in accordance with the review opinions, making it the quietest atmosphere in the history of the council. The meeting was completed on time at 7:00 p.m. The fourth meeting will be held at 3:00 p.m. today to continue discussing proposals on education, public utilities, civil affairs, and health. Among the various proposals passed yesterday, the most important one was the mayor's proposal "to re-draft the city's property tax and municipal construction tax collection methods for currency reform." During the discussion, Zhao Yangxiong, the convener of the Finance Review Committee, first reported on the review process, and Wang Naixu, the convener of the Budget and Final Accounts Review Committee, reported on the review process. Then, Tian Yongqian, the director of the Finance Bureau, explained its importance. Director Tian began with the first sentence: "I have been in office for 18 months, and today is the first time I have asked you for help." He listed that the property tax rates levied by the old Public Works Bureau and the French Concession Board of Directors before the war were higher than the current adjustment rate. He said: "I have always prioritized the burden on citizens, but today, the property tax has to be adjusted. The municipal government has been losing money for months, and the central government will not subsidize it, so the salaries of public education personnel cannot be allocated." After Director Tian finished speaking, Councilors Jiang Jizhou, Jiang Hao, Shi Zongde, Yu Shun, Qu Yue and others put forward amendments to the original method. After Speaker Pan summarized them, the revised methods were passed as follows: property tax and municipal construction tax are collected together, and the tax rate is based on the re-estimated total value of the houses as the tax base. The tax rate is 14 per thousand for commercial houses and 8 per thousand for residential houses per year (half for property tax and half for municipal construction tax). According to the above-mentioned revised methods, the Finance Bureau will still revise the detailed collection rules and submit them to the council for review, and implement them from the autumn of this year. As for another proposal submitted by the mayor, which was a letter sending the city's revised four-month budget book of revenue and expenditure from September to December for review and reply, it was successfully passed after the review opinions revised by the small group, and did not cause debate.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Theater Industry Requests Adjustment of Ticket Prices, Social Affairs Bureau Will Consult with Jiang Jingguo <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Representatives of the city's Peking opera, Yue opera, and other theater industries went to the Social Affairs Bureau again yesterday to request an investigation into ticket prices. Their reason is that the actors invited to perform on stage after the autumn are generally larger than the package silver of the actors performing in the summer. Different actors, increased expenses, so ticket prices cannot be based on 819. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this is an overall problem related to government laws and regulations, and will consult with Supervisor Jiang to resolve it. Xin Guang, Empire and other theaters that originally showed movies have changed to Yue opera after the autumn, and the ticket prices have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau respectively. Lan Xin has recently performed a drama, and the ticket prices have also been decided. As for Yan Huizhu's performance of Peking opera at the China Grand Theater, the Social Affairs Bureau did not allow the ticket prices to be adjusted because Li Wanchun also performed Peking opera at the theater in the previous period. The Great Shanghai Cinema will soon have Yuan Xuefen perform the Yue opera "Coral Introduction" and show the Yue opera movie "Sister Xianglin". The highest ticket price for the two plays will be set at 1.8 gold yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Private Currency Exchange to Purchase Indian Cotton: Special Criminal Court Indicts Rong Hongyuan; Zhang Yamin Received Bribes in June to Conceal the Crime <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Rong Hongyuan, general manager of the Shenxin Textile Corporation, and others, were indicted yesterday by Special Criminal Court Prosecutor Li Yulong after a swift investigation into their private foreign exchange dealings. The original indictment is transcribed below: Defendant Rong Hongyuan, 43 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 186 Seymour Road. In custody. Chen Yuanzhi, Lu Jinzhang, and Pan Yaowen, the above three are at large. The case of the above-named defendants, No. 309 of the Republic of China year 37 for engaging in foreign exchange business, has been investigated and concluded, and it is deemed that prosecution should be initiated. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable laws are listed below: (1) Facts of the crime: Rong Hongyuan, as the general manager of the Shanghai Shenxin Textile Corporation, signed a contract with Shanghai Shenghong Foreign Firm on May 20, 1948, to purchase 1,500 bales of Indian cotton, totaling 735,000 rupees, due to a shortage of raw materials. It was stipulated that an initial deposit equivalent to HK$189,650 would be paid, to be received by the Hong Kong Kelai Zhen Foreign Firm as a representative, and that the full amount would be paid after the company shipped 17,450 bolts of Shuangxi brand cotton cloth to Hong Kong for sale.</p>
<p>Unable to Borrow, Illicit Currency Exchange</p>
<p>Due to the urgent deadline for the deposit, Rong Hongyuan twice instructed Chen Yuanzhi, the company's representative in Hong Kong, to borrow from the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank. Chen Yuanzhi, unable to secure a loan, then asked Pan Yaowen, an employee of the bank, to purchase HK$189,650 in Shanghai foreign exchange for the dates of June 1st and 2nd, 1948, from Daoheng Foreign Exchange, which specializes in foreign exchange business. This amount was converted into 41 billion legal tender, designated to be received by seven firms including Tang Yaoan in Shanghai. After receiving the telegram from Chen Yuanzhi relayed by Lu Jinzhang, Rong Hongyuan dispatched Lu Jinzhang to deliver 8 billion legal tender to Tang Yaoan, 6 billion legal tender to Gong Chongrui, 13 billion legal tender to Lin Siping, 3 billion legal tender to Liang Qianli, 3 billion legal tender to Li Shiying, 2 billion legal tender to Zhou De, and 3 billion legal tender to Guanghua Firm. Rong Hongyuan could not remember where the remaining 3 billion legal tender was exchanged.</p>
<p>Airmail Letter, Detailing Addresses</p>
<p>Afterward, Chen Yuanzhi sent an airmail letter listing the detailed locations of the seven firms, including Tang Yaoan, and the amounts to be paid, to Rong Hongyuan for verification. This letter was seized by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, photographed, and handed over to the Shanghai Police Department, which arrested and transferred Rong Hongyuan for investigation. (2) Evidence and applicable laws: It has been confirmed that Rong Hongyuan, in the name of the Shenxin Textile Corporation, ordered 1,500 bales of Indian cotton from Shenghong Foreign Firm, and after receiving Chen Yuanzhi's notice regarding the required deposit of HK$189,650 in Hong Kong, dispatched Lu Jinzhang to deliver a total of 41 billion legal tender to seven firms including Tang Yaoan. Furthermore, there is a photograph of Chen Yuanzhi's airmail letter and the contract with Shenghong Foreign Firm on file as evidence, making the facts of the crime clear.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Although Claiming to Maintain Credit, He Should Have Telegraphed to Prevent It <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Although it was argued: "Because the company lacked raw materials, I contacted the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank to borrow the deposit. Chen Yuanzhi purchased Shanghai foreign exchange without my consent. To maintain Shenxin's credit, I had no choice but to pay." However, it is found that the defendant, Rong Hongyuan, knowing that Chen Yuanzhi had purchased Shanghai foreign exchange, should have telegraphed to prevent it and return the deposit. Instead, he used the excuse of maintaining commercial credit and instructed Lu Jinzhang, who relayed the foreign exchange telegram, to deliver the payment. It is clear that he should bear the responsibility for engaging in foreign exchange business jointly with Chen Yuanzhi, Pan Yaowen, and Lu Jinzhang. He cannot be excused on the grounds that he procured raw materials for production and purchased Shanghai foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In summary, the defendants Rong Hongyuan and others have indeed violated the regulations for punishing the buying and selling of gold and foreign currencies, and the Central Bank's foreign exchange control regulations. Therefore, this public prosecution is initiated.</p>
<p>As for the seven firms, including Tang Yaoan, involved in the Rong case, the court will open a separate hearing for investigation and registration.</p>

<p>There is an interesting episode in the Rong case. Rong Hongyuan's illicit currency exchange was discovered by Zhang Yamin, the former chief of the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, on June 2nd. Zhang photographed the evidence and used it to extort a large sum from Rong, and thus the matter was suppressed. Later, Zhang was arrested for corruption and sentenced to death. Rong was also imprisoned. This exchange between Rong and Zhang was successively discovered in their confessions. This fact sufficiently explains why the Rong case occurred in early June but was only subjected to legal sanctions now.</p>

<h3 id="e78">British-Owned Trolleybuses in Shanghai Briefly "Slashed Prices"; Autumn Festival Issue Awaits Mediation <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Before last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, employees of the British-owned trolleybus company borrowed half a month's salary from the company, to be repaid in installments. With this year's Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, employees have been requesting to borrow salary as usual. The union decided at a meeting on September 5th to request the company to advance 20 days' salary for the festival, to be repaid over four months. The company stated it could not afford to lend, resulting in a deadlock. As a result, employees' emotions were high. This morning, employees drove the buses out of the factory as usual, but ticket sellers implemented a "price slash," charging a flat rate of 100,000 legal tender regardless of distance. The union's persuasion was ineffective. At 10:30 AM, the union chairman Qiu Changjiang and others went to the Social Affairs Bureau to report the situation to Deputy Director Zhao. Mayor Wu was also informed and instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to order the workers to immediately restore normal operations. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an emergency order, and union leaders returned to persuade the workers. By 11:35 AM, all trolleybus lines had resumed normal ticket sales, awaiting mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. According to employees, the company's daily income before last month's currency reform was around 40 billion legal tender, and recently, income has been good, averaging around 60 billion legal tender daily. Employees' salaries have not increased, and the management's claim of being unable to advance salaries is clearly a pretext.</p>

<h3 id="e81">National Treasures in Chengde: Zhou Bronze Sacrificial Vessels; Two Out of Ten Missing <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Xing Ruofeng</p>
<p>[Chengde Airmail Report, 7th] This mountain city of Chengde, because it was the summer retreat of the former Manchu emperors, still has many relics. Although it has been baptized by artillery fire and undergone great changes, outsiders still visit the "Eight Great Temples." Locals enjoy reminiscing about the past. It is said that when the emperor resided here and officials came and went, many precious treasures were kept in the summer palace of the Mountain Resort, the Ten Scenic Spots, and the Outer Eight Temples. After the Eight-Nation Alliance looted the so-called "Inner Court" treasures in Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, most of the treasures from Rehe were transported to Beijing to replenish the "Inner Court" for display. The remaining treasures were later moved into the Rehe Treasure Museum (located within the Summer Resort). During the twenty years of warlord rule, the treasures in the museum decreased with time. During the occupation period, the Japanese managed the museum for over a decade. It is said that the Japanese made the Treasure Museum look very presentable after much research, but in reality, some of the items were replaced with forgeries. Among the most precious and fortunately preserved treasures were only ten Zhou bronze sacrificial vessels, simply called the "Ten Zhou Bronzes."</p>
<p>Zhou Bronze Archaeology</p>
<p>According to the analysis of archaeologists and the records in the "Chengde Prefecture Records," the "Ten Zhou Bronzes" are indeed rare national treasures. After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese, Soviet troops entered Chengde from northern China. Order was lost, and all cultural relics were thrown into chaos. From that time on, the "Ten Zhou Bronzes" disappeared amidst the turmoil. The Eighth Route Army occupied Chengde for a year, and of course, no one talked about this matter. It was not until the National Army recovered Chengde in the autumn of 1946 that the story of the Zhou bronzes was brought up again.</p>
<p>Treasure Names</p>
<p>At that time, suspicion about the whereabouts of these ten national treasures was inevitable, and everyone thought it would be difficult to recover them intact. However, Fan Jian, the then magistrate of Chengde County, found seven of them. The provincial government reported to the central government, and Magistrate Fan was awarded a commendation for his efforts. The names of the seven recovered treasures are: (1) Zhou Pan-Wen Hu (2) Ju Lei-Wen Hu, (3) Zhou Shu-Zhen (missing base), (4) Zhou Bin Zun, (5) Zhou Su Xi, (6) Zhou Dang-Wen Jue, and (7) Zhou Pan-Wen Yan (missing lid). In addition to these items, there are three that have not yet been found, namely (8) Zhou King Wen Ding, (9) Zhou Meng Feng You, and (10) Zhou Chan-Wen Gui.</p>
<p>"Wenwang Ding"</p>
<p>The seven treasures mentioned above had already been transported to Beiping by the provincial government during the Chengde defense war this summer for safekeeping. The remaining three, however, remained missing. Unexpectedly, the military recently discovered a "King Wen Ding," which is truly "unexpectedly fortuitous." The ding was sent to the Provincial Assembly for unified safekeeping on the 5th by General Shi Jue of the Sui District. The Provincial Assembly convened an appraisal meeting on the 6th, attended by many local elders, who carefully distinguished and determined that the treasure was indeed the King Wen Ding. The ding was measured on the spot, weighing six catties and seven taels (new scale of ten taels), with a total height of 25.3 centimeters, ear height of 4.4, ear width of 4.4, abdominal depth of 9.5, mouth length of 16.5, mouth width of 12.5, and leg height of 12.2. After the appraisal, it was tagged, and the attendees stamped their seals as proof, and then sent it to the provincial government for storage. They also jointly sent a letter thanking Commander Shi Jue, requesting that the original discoverer be given a commendation for his meritorious service.</p>
<p>So far, only two of the "Ten Zhou Bronzes" are missing. A local elder said: "The Ten Zhou Bronzes are national treasures passed down for more than three thousand years. Now that eight have been found, the discovery of the remaining two must not be far off."</p>

<p>[Another Telegram] Since the launch of the comfort-the-troops-with-cloth-shoes campaign, the response from all parties has been enthusiastic. After Chinese women in the Philippines donated funds to Madame Chiang to produce 18,000 pairs of cloth shoes, the wives of the heads of military institutions in the capital have also responded enthusiastically. Those who have already donated include: Madame He Yingqin, wife of Minister of National Defense, 250 pairs; Madame Zhu Tong, wife of Chief of General Staff Gu, 200 pairs; Madame Yu Hanmou, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Army Yu, 100 pairs; Madame Gui Yongqing, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Gui, 100 pairs; Madame Guo Chan, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces Guo, 100 pairs; Madame Sun Lianzhong, wife of Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison Command Sun, 100 pairs; Madame Li and Lan, wife of Deputy Minister of National Defense Li, 50 pairs. The wives of other leaders are also donating successively.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The comfort-the-troops-with-cloth-shoes campaign is being launched nationwide. In order to expand the response, all sectors of the capital have specifically organized a prize-winning entertainment event from the 17th to the 19th.

In addition to enjoying entertainment, they can also win prizes through a lottery with the ticket. Entertainment, comforting the troops, and winning prizes are all achieved in one fell swoop. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been requesting to pre-order tickets, and more than 20,000 tickets have already been sold.</p>

However, fellow villagers in Beijing believe it is too heavy and only allow collecting three and borrowing one. After repeated meetings in Beijing, no solution has been reached. Liao Ziying, the newly appointed director of the Provincial Grain Bureau, proposed a compromise solution of collecting three and borrowing one and a half, but the central government and Anhui gentry did not accept it, resulting in the current stalemate, and there is no confirmed date for the commencement of the collection.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>We recently received a letter from Liao Bin, a former judge of the Qingpu County Judicial Office, stating: "After reading the reports on the autopsy of Shen Pang Guiying in the September 4th and 8th newspapers, there are many inaccuracies. (1) Shen's body was repeatedly examined by inspectors sent by the office, and Su Gao Jianchu was instructed by Bin to approve the dispatch of forensic doctor Xuan Fang for a re-examination. It was not requested by the supervising delegation. (2) Shen Weiting's confession that Yan had demanded travel expenses was deemed to have received improper benefits, and Su Gao Jianchu was immediately notified by telegram to hand it over for investigation or transfer jurisdiction. It was then instructed by this county to handle the case. At the time of his discharge, he transferred the case, and the clerk Chen Guangchong was suspected of another crime and was immediately notified to Gao Jianchu and presented to the court for approval. Bin did not detain those who were assigned to various personnel due to slight criminal suspicions at the time, but had already reported the case first. (3) Bin requested to resign early, and was replaced by Wang Jiyuan, who was appointed by the court on July 26, while the Shen case was accepted on July 29. How could he leave his post due to handling this case? I would like to make a initial inquiry as a prosecutor and not conclude it, so I would bear the false name of indulgence and have no rumors. The matter is related to legal reputation, dare not declare, ask to correct."</p>

<p>[Our Report from Kunming, 13th] The three towns of Lancang Mengyun in southern Yunnan, which border Myanmar, have been occupied by deserted soldiers of the former 93rd Division. They are forcibly conscripting militiamen within the occupied area and resisting the payment of taxes and the suppression of rebels, and are threatening to advance into other towns. Shi Bingjun, a member of the county council, has telegraphed the province calling for troops to quell the rebellion. It is rumored that the cause of the rebellion was a disagreement between Mengyun Town Mayor Shi Binglin and local gentry Liu Shaohong. After Liu killed Shi Binglin, he recruited deserters from the former 93rd Division to occupy the area in an attempt to resist the central government. Both sides are preparing for a large-scale armed conflict, and the situation is quite serious. Note: Mengyun was formerly under the jurisdiction of the Menglian Chief Secretary during the Qing Dynasty. After the abolition of the native chieftain system and the establishment of direct rule, it was divided into three towns, located on the southwestern border of Lancang.</p>

The authorities, recognizing the importance of telecommunications, instructed Bingjian and others to first connect the telecommunications business between Shanghai and Chongqing and Chengdu, setting an example for Zu Ti and paving the way for repatriation. Later, we were ordered to take over the telecommunications business in Shanghai from the stubborn enemy. Various matters were complex and tedious. Although they are now past events, they should be a glorious page in the history of telecommunications in our country, and they are also sufficient to highlight the importance of telecommunications to the nation and society!</p>
<p>Three years of hard work should have yielded results, but due to a shortage of resources, we often find it difficult to fulfill our wishes. Business expansion naturally has many effects. However, in terms of engineering construction and business facilities, we have tried our best to move forward. For example, the increase in telephone and telegraph equipment, the construction of receiving stations, and the training of telecommunications personnel have all been carried out by this bureau with limited resources. Similarly, the innovation of business, the increase in speed, and the pursuit of universal and thorough service are constantly being improved in accordance with the instructions of our superiors. Fortunately, after years of effort, we have made some progress. This is due to the efforts of our colleagues and the enthusiastic cooperation of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Speaking of this bureau's future work plan, we will continue to adhere to our original intentions, engaging in the construction of telephone and telegraph equipment and the improvement of business facilities. The cultivation of a good service spirit among our staff is also one of the central tasks for the future. Our concern is that our income is insufficient, which is now even more serious. Replenishing equipment is especially difficult. We will carefully consider the urgency of the situation, assess the burden of financial resources, and proceed step by step in order to achieve our goals. Business facilities should be further improved in terms of speed, accuracy, and convenience, in order to achieve the goal of universal service and to promote the expression of a good service spirit among our colleagues. Bingjian and Hongjun have responsibilities, and we dare not fail to encourage our colleagues to work together. We still hope that advanced and virtuous people will provide guidance at any time to correct our shortcomings. We would be very grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— General Overview of Engineering</p>
<p>The implementation of construction plans relies on transportation as a precursor, and telecommunications is the transportation of transportation, the significance of its mission is self-evident. China's telecommunications industry has been established for more than sixty years. From its initial establishment to its basic scale, it has suffered from the obstruction of internal unrest and the devastation of foreign aggression. After several difficult operations and continuous improvements, in terms of equipment, it has advanced from Morse machines to teletypewriters and facsimile telegraph machines, or from magneto telephones to automatic telephone machines, and even to carrier telephone machines, reaching a prosperous state. Shanghai is a major commercial port, the hub of transportation, occupying a primary position, and its equipment should be particularly complete. Since the victory, three years have passed. Recalling these three years, due to the simplicity of the enemy's remaining telecommunications machinery and the lack of materials, coupled with the scarcity of foreign exchange support, replenishment was not easy, resulting in great difficulties in the reorganization and expansion of telecommunications equipment. Fortunately, with the earnest supervision of superiors and the concerted efforts of colleagues, we have strived to overcome obstacles. Therefore, based on the principle of reviewing the past and encouraging the future, we will present a general overview of the Bureau's engineering, highlighting the most important aspects, and summarize them in a record, which we believe will be welcomed by those concerned about telecommunications.</p>
<p>Central Office</p>
<p>The central office is located upstairs in the main business office at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Sichuan Road, serving as the nerve center for transmitting and receiving machine parts. Telegraphs are concentrated here. "Outgoing telegrams" received by the business office are transmitted to the telegraph room via a delivery device. A perforating machine is used to connect consecutive small holes on oiled paper strips, word by word. The perforated paper strips are loaded onto an automatic transmitter or teletypewriter to send signal currents. This current is transmitted to the transmitting station via remote control equipment for transmission. Signal radio waves sent from the other party are first received by the receiving station and also transmitted to the central office via remote control equipment. After amplification, they are recorded as codes by a wave recorder (or manual machine) or directly typed into text by a teletypewriter. Therefore, the central office integrates transmitting and receiving machines in one place, maintaining contact with various locations at any time, reaching far and wide. The Bureau's central office currently has twenty-four teletypewriters, twenty automatic transmitters, three sound machines, twenty-one manual machines, two twelve-channel carrier machines, four four-channel carrier machines, and thirty-eight amplifiers. The number of amplifiers is still insufficient for application and expansion is planned, with an estimated increase to forty-five units within the year. The central office also has an attached repair shop, equipped with machine tools such as lathes, drilling machines, grinding wheels, as well as high-frequency oscillators, universal meters, vacuum tube voltmeters, and circuit testers. When mechanical failures occur, they can be repaired within fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Transmitting Station</p>
<p>There are five transmitting stations: Nanxiang, Hongkou, Jianguo West Road, Fuxing Island, and Fuzhou Road. Nanxiang is the largest in scale, covering an area of more than two hundred acres, and is the transmitting center of domestic wireless telegraphy. The Bureau currently has forty-four transmitters, the largest being 3KW and the smallest being 200W, of which five are used for voice transmission, and the rest are dedicated to telegraph transmission. As for transmitting antennas, after three years of reorganization and expansion, there are thirty directional antennas and twenty-six non-directional antennas. It is planned to add four directional antennas within the year to improve communication efficiency. Due to the importance of the Nanxiang station, it has its own 125KVA oil engine generator, which is sufficient for the entire station's usage. In the event of a city power outage, it can be started at any time to avoid interruptions. The working conditions of remote control and transmitters are also displayed with indicators, which can be seen at a glance. The Nanxiang transmitting station also has an attached repair shop, equipped with machine tools such as lathes and drilling machines, which can adequately handle its own machine repair and parts work.</p>
<p>Receiving Station</p>
<p>The Bureau currently uses the Zhabei receiving station as the main receiving station, covering an area of dozens of acres. In addition to the Fuzhou Road, Hongkou, Fuxing Island, and Xikang Road stations, which also have several receiving machines, there is also a portion attached to the Liuheng receiving station of the International Wireless Radio Station. The Bureau currently has ten diversity receiving machines and forty-nine single machines. Because the Liuheng station has a larger area, all diversity receiving machines are located there. In order to expand its business, the Bureau has purchased one hundred acres of land in Qibao in the suburbs to build a new receiving station to meet the needs. According to the planned schedule, it will be built in three phases. The first phase of the project has now been completed, and it is expected to be fully operational by next spring. The laying of remote control cables is currently underway and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Facsimile Machine Room</p>
<p>Facsimile telegraphs can be classified into two types: photographic telegraphs and true handwriting telegraphs. The former can transmit photographs to the other party via electrical energy. The receiving film at the other end still needs to be developed and printed using photographic techniques. The latter can transmit handwritten text or charts to the other party via electrical energy, directly receiving a vivid reproduction of the original. The Bureau's facsimile telegraph machine is a true handwriting telegraph machine, currently only one unit, dedicated to communication with Nanjing. It usually uses a loaded-line carrier circuit for transmission. When the loaded-line condition is unstable, it can be switched to a wired circuit at any time, so it is extremely good and reliable. The special nature of Chinese characters means that the alphabetic spelling method cannot be adopted, so ordinary telegrams must first translate the characters into telegraph codes and send them to the other party, who then translates the codes back into characters. This not only involves overly complex procedures and wastes time, but also inevitably leads to errors. Now, the use of this true handwriting telegraph machine can not only increase the transmission speed, but also guarantee absolute accuracy, and is a new equipment worth promoting.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Telephone Room</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone room is located on the third floor of the Bureau's Hongkou building, serving as the hub of the country's long-distance telephone network. When users make a call, the recording desk registers it first, and then the long-distance desk connects them one by one in order. For the purpose of assessing the performance of the staff, a monitoring desk is also set up to monitor their work at any time. In total, there are currently six recording desk positions, one monitoring desk position, two long-distance dedicated line desk positions, twenty-four wired long-distance desk positions, and four wireless long-distance desk positions. Another room has been opened next door, equipped with four international long-distance desk positions, dedicated to long-distance calls to countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Cuba. In recent years, the long-distance telephone business has developed rapidly, and the existing equipment is insufficient for application and expansion is urgently needed. Sixty long-distance desk positions have been ordered from the United States to meet the needs of business expansion.</p>
<p>Wireless Telephone Terminal Equipment Room</p>
<p>The function of the terminal equipment room is similar to that of the central office for telegraphs, serving as the nerve center for loaded-line telephone communication. The voice signal sent by the user must be transmitted from the long-distance desk to the transmitting station via the terminal equipment for transmission. The signal received by the receiving station from the other party must also first pass through the terminal equipment and then be transferred to the long-distance desk before being transmitted to the user's earpiece. Its function can prevent conflicts between transmitting and receiving. In addition, because the terminal equipment has an amplification function and can adjust the volume, preventing "feedback" (Reed Oack) from causing "singing", its function is crucial. The Bureau currently has five of these terminal equipment units. In order to meet the needs of rapid business expansion, another unit will soon be added.</p>
<p>Local Telephone Exchange</p>
<p>The Bureau's area is vast, reaching Wusong in the north, Minhang in the south, Pudong in the east, and Qibao in the west. Its wide range is unmatched by other special cities in the country. The need for local telephones is strong, but because the replenishment of materials is not easy, the service is difficult to be satisfactory. There are currently nine exchanges: Hongkou, Nanshi, City Center, Pudong, Wusong, Fuxing Island, Zhenru, Longhua, and Minhang. Except for the first three, which have enemy-destroyed machine keys that can be used, the remaining six were rebuilt or added after the victory in the past three years after raising funds for equipment. The current capacity of each exchange is listed below: Hongkou has 2,700 automatic lines; Nanshi has 2,000 automatic lines; the City Center has 600 automatic lines; Pudong has 300 manual lines; Wusong has 200 manual lines; Fuxing Island has 200 manual lines; Zhenru has 60 manual lines; Longhua has 200 manual lines; Minhang has 30 manual lines. From the above, it can be seen that the scale of each exchange is still small, so a repair shop cannot be attached to each one. Only a telephone repair shop is set up in the Hongkou exchange, and the equipment is still lacking. Recently, the Hongkou exchange is actively carrying out expansion projects, which are expected to be completed within the year. In order to take into account the needs of the western suburbs of Shanghai, the establishment of the Qibao exchange has also been planned, which may be completed within the year.</p>
<p>Line Equipment: The Bureau's local telephone lines are spread throughout the city, and all business districts of the exchanges described in Section (7) can be reached, with Hongkou and Nanshi being the most densely populated. There are trunk lines connecting each exchange, sufficient for frequent calls. As for telegraph remote control lines, they are centered on the central office and distributed in all directions, connecting each transmitting station and each receiving station to achieve the function of communication and transmission. The above two types of lines can be divided into three categories: overhead open wire, overhead cable, and underground cable. The Huangpu River divides the city into eastern and western districts. Communication between Pudong and Puxi relies on submarine cables for connection. The Bureau has selected sites to lay three submarine cables, dedicated to trunk lines and telephone dedicated lines. The quantities of various line equipment are summarized and listed below: a total of 8,500 wooden poles, 1,280 pair kilometers of overhead open wire, approximately 200 kilometers of overhead cable, approximately 10 kilometers of underground conduit, approximately 130 kilometers of underground cable, and approximately 3.5 kilometers of submarine cable. Recently, due to the construction of the Qibao receiving station and the Qibao exchange, the remote control line and trunk line engineering required for that area in the future have commenced and will be completed within the month.</p>
<p>Machine Repair and Allocation</p>
<p>The types of machines and the extent of equipment of the Bureau are as described above. The required parts cannot all be supplied by foreign countries, so at the beginning of the restoration, the establishment of a telecommunications machine repair and allocation office was started, with the goal of manufacturing or repairing various telecommunications machines and parts. It was first established at the site of the Xindong Motor Factory on Zhoujiazui Road in the spring of the 35th year and officially started operations in October of the same year. Later, due to the small size of the building and the simple equipment, although gradual progress was made, development was difficult to achieve. Therefore, in the autumn of the 36th year, efforts were made to recover the factory building of the former Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Machine Repair and Manufacturing Plant in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, and it was rebuilt. After several months of preparation, all the machines were moved in, including three workshops, one material warehouse, two dormitories, and one office building, along with the power room, club, dining room, and kitchen, covering an area of more than ten acres, with spare land for expanding the workshop. After several expansions and reorganizations, it has taken shape. There are currently more than sixty various large and small lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, planers, sawing machines, punching machines, universal grinders, and film rolling machines, and lettering machines. The number of machine parts produced each month is in the tens of thousands. In addition to meeting the needs of the Bureau, it also repairs machines for nearby bureaus in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other places.</p>
<p>Other After the Bureau's restoration, a large number of materials were required to repair old machines and lines and to supplement new equipment. However, at the beginning of the victory, Chinese and foreign shipping was not open, and the stocks of merchants in the market were almost entirely collected by the enemy puppets. Therefore, in addition to a portion of the required materials being airlifted from the rear for emergency use, only those that could be applied were selected from the enemy puppet's remaining materials to provide some support. Later, as shipping gradually opened up, in addition to the imported materials ordered from foreign countries, several batches of relief materials and surplus US military materials were allocated by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In addition, more than ten batches of enemy puppet telecommunications materials were purchased from the Enemy Puppet Property Disposal Bureau at a price. The number of the above materials was considerable, but because they belonged to military properties and were mostly incomplete, they had to be greatly repaired and modified before they could be used. In addition, the procedures for counting, storing, and distributing were cumbersome, which the original staff of the Materials Section could not handle. Therefore, a Materials Storage and Transportation Office was established, and under the orders of the Telecommunications Administration, it allocated, transported, and supplied materials to various bureaus across the country for emergency use. Later, because there was a batch of wireless radio equipment in the relief materials, most of which were surplus materials from the US Navy, the quantity was huge and the damage was particularly severe, requiring spacious warehouses and workshops and technical experts to organize them. Therefore, twelve factory buildings were built separately in Zhenru and Nanxiang, and engineers and technicians were borrowed from the International Radio Station to establish a separate organization to repair them. Since last autumn, the Ministry of Communications established a Material Requisition Committee, which, together with the Ministry of National Defense, distributed and inspected the Okinawan equipment transported by the "Material Supply Bureau." The Bureau had to assist in handling it and transferred more than ten technicians from the bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Guangdong, and Nanjing to take charge of it. As of now, the telecommunications equipment inspected, repaired, allocated, and transported to various parts of the country by the Bureau has reached more than 10,000 orders. The manpower and financial resources consumed by this work are quite considerable, and there is often a sense of being exhausted. In addition, the issuance of import passports and re-export certificates for wireless radio materials and the reorganization of radio stations are also part of the Bureau's ancillary work. The former is relatively simple in nature and involves less work. Since the victory, 130,000 radios have been imported. Among them, from the time the government opened international exchange in March of the 35th year to the time imports were restricted in the winter of that year, the import quantity reached more than 116,000 units, which is truly shocking. As for the work of reorganizing radio stations, although illegal radio stations have been repeatedly investigated, sealed, and banned, they have not yet been brought into the right track and need to be continued.</p>
<p>The general overview of the Bureau's engineering has been described above. Although its equipment has been expanded several times compared to the time of restoration, it is still insufficient to meet the needs of society. However, looking back over the past three years, whether it was due to a lack of manpower, financial constraints, or a lack of materials, we were overwhelmed and could not attend to everything at once. We moved forward steadily, with many difficulties, and the current somewhat satisfactory scale is all due to the supervision of our superiors and the hard work of the Bureau's more than six hundred colleagues who have worked hard for the public good. The victory of the War of Resistance has reached its third anniversary. Looking around the country, people's livelihoods are difficult and all industries are declining. Looking to the future, we are deeply encouraged. The central work for the second half of this year includes the expansion of the Hongkou exchange, the improvement of the power supply of the Nanshi exchange, the renovation of the long-distance desk, the increase of wireless telephone machines, the increase of directional antennas at the Nanxiang transmitting station, and the strengthening of power supply equipment, the enrichment of the central office equipment, the relocation of the terminal equipment room, and the construction of the Qibao receiving station and exchange. Although some of these projects are about to be completed or are being actively constructed, there are still those that are waiting for materials and have not yet been started. To promote their completion, we must work hard and are willing to take this auspicious day to record it and encourage our colleagues. We also hope that domestic experts will come forward to teach us, which would be of great benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Progress of Our Bureau's Operations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tong</p>
<p>It has been three years since the restoration of our bureau. During this time, the reorganization and improvement of operations have been complex and faced many obstacles. Fortunately, with the urging of the authorities, the support of all sectors of society, and the efforts of telecommunications colleagues, we have made considerable progress. The following is a brief outline of the development of the bureau's operations in recent years:</p>
<p>A. Telegraphs</p>
<p>(1) Expanding Circuits</p>
<p>Through two years of planning and coordination by our bureau's wireless communications department, we have actively communicated with inland areas to restore north-south communications. Major cities have direct circuits available. Recently, we have opened direct wireless circuits to Yantai, Huaining, Zhengzhou, Jinan, and other places. We have also installed teletypewriters on the Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Wuhu circuits to improve reporting efficiency. Other circuits will be opened with second or third lines as needed, depending on the situation, to alleviate telegraph traffic. Currently, our bureau has 20 wired circuits and 30 wireless circuits.</p>
<p>(2) Rapidly Increasing Telegraph Traffic</p>
<p>In the past year, the market has fluctuated frequently. Telegraph traffic has surged whenever prices fluctuate significantly. The tension and busyness of using limited manpower and equipment to cope with the unlimited increase in telegraphs can be imagined. The following is a comparison of the number of telegrams this year with last year:</p>
<p>(3) Maximizing Expansion of Express Telegrams</p>
<p>As telegraph traffic increased while circuit capacity was limited, transmission in sequence inevitably caused some delays. To meet the needs of various sectors, express telegrams were opened on important circuits. These telegrams were transmitted in advance to save time. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable and highly praised by all sectors. After continuous discussions, the number of express telegram circuits has been increased to 26.</p>
<p>(4) Conducting a Telegraph Accuracy Campaign</p>
<p>According to statistics, last year more than 50,000 telegrams nationwide could not be delivered, with incomplete or illegible recipient names and addresses accounting for more than 30,000. To eliminate and reduce such errors, a telegraph accuracy campaign was launched this year. In addition to printing 100,000 labels to distribute to users for cooperation, we strengthened error correction and intensified spot checks. Since implementation, telegraph errors have been reduced daily, with the error percentage decreasing from 0.132% to 0.032%.</p>
<p>(5) Implementing Zonal Delivery</p>
<p>To improve the speed of telegram delivery, zonal delivery of incoming telegrams has been implemented. Incoming telegram delivery branches have been established on Zhongshan South Road and Xikang Road. Plans are underway to establish more delivery branches in important areas.</p>
<p>(6) Relocating Telegraph Room for Centralized Operations</p>
<p>The original location of our bureau's wireless telegraph operating room was on Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei, which was inconvenient for handling telegraph traffic. To centralize operations and improve efficiency, a remote-control receiving system was adopted to move the central receiving and dispatching operations. The relocation of major circuits has now been mostly completed.</p>
<p>(7) Establishing an Inspection Radio Station</p>
<p>To meet the needs of operations and the environment, an inspection radio station was established. The station's work scope is divided into two parts: broadcast inspection and communications inspection. Since its establishment, it has achieved considerable success in regulating the city's broadcasting stations and cracking down on illegal radio stations.</p>
<p>(8) Using Chinese Typewriters to Copy and Translate Incoming Telegrams</p>
<p>Ten Chinese typewriters specially for translating telegrams were added and used in wired and wireless telegraph operating rooms. Due to the limited number of machines, the speed is slightly slower. Currently, they are only used to copy and translate diplomatic telegrams and incoming telegrams from non-registered users.</p>
<p>(9) Conducting a Messenger Service for Collecting Return Telegrams</p>
<p>Messengers can also collect return telegrams when delivering telegrams. For incoming telegrams requesting a reply, the dispatching clerk adds a "Please Reply" stamp to the telegram envelope and delivers it through the messenger. After inquiry, if an immediate return telegram is required, the messenger can collect the return telegram and fees according to the procedure and bring them back to the bureau for transmission, which is very fast.</p>
<p>B. Telephone A. Long-Distance Telephone Services</p>
<p>(1) Conducting Express Telephone Callback Service</p>
<p>Since the opening of the express telephone service last year, the user demand has been too great, and the supply and demand gap has been too wide. To consider the connection time limit, our bureau must stop registrations from time to time. However, users often wish to register regardless of the time limit due to urgent needs. Our bureau adopted the "Express Callback" method, registering all registered users one by one and handing them over to the callback station to estimate the connection time and notify users by telephone. Since its implementation, users have been satisfied. Express telephone service between Shanghai and Tianjin, and between Shanghai and Chongqing was opened in August. Express telephone service in Wuhu, Xuzhou, Jiangdu, and other places will also be opened successively.</p>
<p>(2) Expanding Alternate Transmission Telephone Service</p>
<p>Since the opening of the alternate transmission telephone service in March last year, users have found it very convenient. Since January of this year, all bureaus with direct circuits to our bureau have opened alternate transmission services one after another.</p>
<p>(3) Expanding Traffic Routes to Cooperate with Long-Distance Needs</p>
<p>In September of last year, our bureau had 63 pairs of wired long-distance telephone circuits and wireless circuits to Qingdao, Beiping, Hankou, Tianjin, Chongqing, Taipei, Jinan, Guangzhou, and other eight places. International calls included two Sino-American wireless circuits. This year, with a shortage of equipment, we worked hard to expand the circuits, adding 14 circuits to Nanjing, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Anhui, and other places. Domestically, wireless communication locations were added in Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, and other places. Considering the busy traffic between Shanghai and Tianjin, another pair of circuits was added. International telephone service opened Sino-British wireless communication on March 1st, and communication to Mexico, Cuba, and Canada on June 1st. Communication to Honolulu is scheduled to open on September 15th, and Hong Kong wireless telephone is also in testing. The long-distance switchboard also added six seats in March.</p>
<p>(4) Improving Service</p>
<p>All long-distance telephone staff are trained in batches, imparting various business regulations, service ethics, and answering attitudes to achieve the goal of "humble attitude and thoughtful service."</p>
<p>B. City Telephone Business</p>
<p>(1) Opening Shared Line Telephone Service The supply of telephones in this city cannot meet the demand, and the replenishment of machines is slow and does not solve the urgent problem. To consider the needs of citizens, those who can negotiate the consent of users near our bureau can jointly apply to install a shared line telephone for joint use.</p>
<p>(2) Universally Installing Public Telephones Since the installation of telephones in various districts of this city, citizens have been able to use them everywhere. In addition to installing public telephones in appropriate locations in the urban area, our bureau has also installed suburban public telephones in Meilong, Zhenru, Dachang, Xinjing, Yinxiang Port, Longhua, Beicai, Zhangjiangzha, and other places to benefit the public.</p>
<p>(3) Installing Dedicated Line Telephones When prices fluctuate, the telephone traffic in this city increases, making it difficult to connect. In view of this, our bureau has persuaded all branches of institutions and factories to install dedicated line telephones so that the head office and affiliated institutions can communicate immediately, achieving the effect of fingers and arms and reducing the call rate of city telephones.</p>
<p>(4) Establishing a Time Reporting Station To facilitate citizens, in addition to broadcasting the Customs bell sounds at the Hongkou and Nanshi exchanges, our bureau has also established a time reporting station. Users who want to know the standard time can dial 17 to receive the report.</p>
<p>(5) Establishing a Service Counter The service counter specializes in answering inquiries about the arrival and departure dates and times of trains, ships, and airplanes, etc.</p>
<p>(1) Adding Teletype Machines to Business Offices To speed up the transmission of outgoing telegrams, last year, teletype machines were installed in the Yuyuan Road, Changzhi Road, and North Station business offices, as well as the Xin Xin Company telegraph collection office. This year, we will continue to install British machines in the North Sichuan Road and South Zhongshan Road branch offices.</p>
<p>(2) Simplifying Outgoing Telegram Processing Procedures The procedures for transmitting and processing outgoing telegrams received by each branch office are streamlined to be reasonable, and the job assignments of staff are adjusted from time to time.</p>
<p>(3) Compiling Work Instructions for Each Branch Office According to the actual needs of each business office and the complexity of the business, they are compiled separately and instructed to comply.</p>
<p>(4) Supplementing Training for Salespersons Lectures are compiled and printed on applied knowledge in business for spare-time study.</p>
<p>(5) Holding Review Meetings Regularly Responsible persons from each business unit are summoned regularly to review gains and losses for improvement.</p>
<p>(6) Establishing Branch Business Offices and Agencies Since September of last year, a total of ten units have been added, including the South Zhongshan Road, City Center, and East Zhongshan Road branch offices, the South Xizang Road telegraph kiosk, the Pacific Travel Agency, the first and second wharf reception centers of the China Merchants Bureau, and the Zhoupu, Beicai, and Zhangjiangzha telegraph and telephone agencies.</p>
<p>(7) Public Service Desks are Set Up in Demonstration Business Offices Including the general business office, Changzhi Road, and South Zhongshan Road. Excellent salespersons are selected to handle oral inquiries and draft telegrams for various services.</p>
<p>(8) Conduct Cleanliness, Humility, Telegraph Accuracy, and Telephone Saving Campaigns Various campaigns are held periodically and continue to be promoted.</p>
<p>(9) Extending Business Hours of Business Offices In response to public demand, the business hours of the North Station Branch, the Confucian Temple Telegraph Kiosk, and the South Xizang Road Telegraph Kiosk are extended.</p>
<p>(10) About Telegraph Inquiries, Selling Valuable Outgoing Telegraph Paper, and Increasing the Acceptance of Timed Express Telegrams Business Offices To handle telegraph error inquiries, eleven units including Yuyuan Road and East Zhongshan Road are designated. To sell valuable outgoing telegram paper, ten units including the general business office are designated. The North Station Branch is also designated to handle express telegraph services.</p>
<p>(11) Using Six-Digit Registration Numbers</p>
<p>With the surge in telegraph traffic, four-digit registration numbers have long been insufficient, often causing those who register for telegraph numbers to be disappointed. After detailed research and planning, our bureau has adopted six-digit registration numbers, from 500001 to 599999. The first two digits are used to identify zonal delivery (from 50-59), which is quite convenient for delivering telegrams, and the registration numbers available to users are fully supplied.</p>
<p>D. Conclusion</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a public service, and telecommunications operations should strive for speed and thoroughness. In the past year, due to environmental, human, and material limitations, we are still far from the expected goals. Moreover, public needs are constantly evolving, and telecommunications traffic is the national nervous system. All places and bureaus are connected, and their breath is related. A single mistake affects the whole country. Therefore, how to enable Shanghai telecommunications to meet the needs of the public is an urgent task. We hope that domestic sages and telecommunications pioneers will continue to cooperate and give guidance so that the development of the telecommunications industry can truly rely on it.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to guide the transfer of foreign exchange assets of exchange firms. He returned to Beijing by night train yesterday after completing his official duties. According to Vice Minister Xu:</p>

The high-quality market remained sluggish and lifeless.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially fell by 2 jiao at the opening, slightly improved by 1 jiao due to real sales in the middle of the street, and finally retreated to 26.5 yuan, falling another 5 jiao compared to last Saturday.

<h3 id="e115">Reading "On Vanity" <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yong</p>
<p>Some time ago, I read Mr. Wu's "On Vanity" and had many thoughts. I can roughly define it as:</p>
<p>"Political morality is perhaps immoral." Perhaps this statement is too inflammatory, especially when spoken by someone like us who doesn't understand the so-called "political science." It may cause experts to scoff, but this is what my heart feels at peace with, and cannot tolerate "vanity." Originally, morality has no fixed standard. After pondering, I feel like it is always seeking greater benefits, just like Mencius said, "There are things more desirable than life, and things more hateful than death." The ultimate goal of morality is probably to seek that "more than" thing. "More than" exists when individuals are the object, and it is not lacking when the masses are the object. It would be ideal if one could consider both the individual and the whole, otherwise sacrificing oneself to save the group is saintly, refusing to benefit the world by plucking out a single hair is fulfilling one's duty, and harming others to benefit oneself is petty. However, when it comes to vying for political power, these standards become somewhat incompatible. Mozi's "Universal Love" chapter once used theft and murder to illustrate the unreasonableness of war, but the world is inherently like this. To put it nicely, killing a few people can save the majority.</p>
<p>This is not a theoretical but a factual issue. The concept of "the winner is king, the loser is bandit" has been accumulated for thousands of years, but Emperor Gaozu of Han remains in the position of emperor. Except for Sima Qian, who likes to complain, no one dares to include Xiang Yu in the main chronicles, let alone the Yellow Turbans and Red Eyebrows. If benevolence and righteousness exist among the lords, then one must bow to reality. No one is willing to bow to reality, but no one can do anything about it. This is how the Twenty-Four Histories were written. Otherwise, our history would be impossible to tell.</p>
<p>Mencius is really interesting, on the one hand, he brags and expands, "Who can unify it!" "One who does not delight in killing can unify it!" On the other hand, he emphasizes Tang and Wu's punitive expeditions. Isn't punitive expedition killing? "I have heard of the execution of one man, Zhou, but have not heard of killing a ruler," but the "Wu Cheng" chapter of the Book of Documents clearly says, "They turned their spears around, and the blood flowed enough to float pestles." Although some say this is an exaggeration, it is true that many people were killed. So, isn't Mencius telling lies! If I were King Hui of Liang or King Xuan of Qi, I wouldn't welcome his pedantic theories either. It is probably from this tradition that later generations of Confucian scholars have become impractical and empty-headed.</p>
<p>Therefore, scholars who are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality can never be emperors. Some people even scold this kind of "warm-hearted benevolence" as "woman's benevolence." But what is the essential difference between woman's benevolence and great man's benevolence? Women love kittens and puppies, does that mean men advocate killing all cats and dogs? If a woman is deceived by a villain (mostly a man), does that mean the woman deserves to die? All that originates from "love" should, in theory, be without near and far, without difference, without friend or foe. That is God's intention. Why is woman's benevolence undesirable? It's just to say that if you want to play with the world in the palm of your hand, then woman's benevolence is not allowed. However, a white-faced scholar with no strength to fight chickens, from his youth in school, hums and babbles about benevolence and righteousness, and even laments the death of a stink bug. How can he talk about burning books, burying scholars alive, and killing people like grass without a sound? Needless to say, if they want to compete for political power, they will inevitably fail (they don't think about these things at all, they would be content with being a peaceful official). Even if they inherit the foundation of their fathers and brothers, I am afraid it will be difficult to ensure that they "enjoy a long life." The cases of Emperor Jianwen being expelled by the Prince of Yan and Li Chongguang dying from a traction-machine drug are both extremely tragic examples. Emperor Gaozu of Han using a doctoral hat as a chamber pot is truly great, from the standpoint of political morality, this is an absolute necessity. And his later killing of Han Xin, and pickling Peng Yue, and Zhu Yuanzhang's killing of Li Shanchang, and handling of Hu Weiyong, are all things that scholars would never do and would curse endlessly. They do not know that this is precisely why Gao of Han is Gao of Han, and why the Ming Ancestor is the Ming Ancestor.</p>
<p>If you cannot see through this mystery, and cannot jump out of this circle, it is better to have less ambition, so as to avoid a great tragedy. Lao Tzu's words are absolutely correct, "The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao." If political morality can be spoken, it is probably not that which can be spoken, the reason why it can be "constant," is precisely because it is "unusual," how wonderful!</p>
<h3 id="e116">"Burning Plate" <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Beijing dialect refers to the blushing of people due to shame as "burning the plate." It is said that "plate" is the face, and "burning" means red.</p>
<p>However, in novels, the description of shame often includes sayings such as "the face is so red with shame that it reaches the neck." According to travelers, among relatively primitive tribes that often practice nudity, shame often starts from the face and goes down to the waist. But many painters' reports go even further. They say that when they draw nudes, the models sometimes blush from head to toe due to shyness, which in Beijing dialect can be described as "burning" the whole body.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Random Notes on Film Adaptation of Peking Opera <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— He Shi Xi</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang, at the invitation of director Fei Mu, is producing a color film, intending to market it abroad. I hear that the scene of "Farewell My Concubine" with the sword dance has already been filmed, and only a small part of the play "Life and Death Hate" has been completed. The plot is still being considered for additions and subtractions, which I believe is a matter worthy of discussion. I have a few opinions to share openly with those who love Mei.</p>
<p>(1) The story of "Life and Death Hate" comes from Tao Zongyi's "輟耕錄" of the Yuan Dynasty. This time, a good edition of this book should be found, and the record of this episode should be shown before the film as a "premise," so that people know that this play has a famous work as its basis, and is not a baseless fabrication.</p>
<p>(2) It is appropriate to design the most ideal Chinese stage architecture, such as a dome-shaped stage ceiling, a grand stage surface, and all kinds of exquisitely embroidered table drapes, large curtains, and stage curtains, all of which can be given close-up shots. The Peking Opera orchestra (commonly known as "Wen Wu Chang Mian") should be given a clear presentation so that foreigners or Chinese people who are not familiar with Peking Opera can learn about the organization of Peking Opera instruments.</p>
<p>(3) At the beginning of the story, the first character to appear on stage must step out from the entrance (and the large curtain door will be removed afterward). The last character to leave the stage in the final scene must be made to enter the stage from the reappearing curtain door, and then the curtain closes, so as to clearly show that this is a stage play. (Editor's note: Points (2) and (3) are quite similar to Sir Laurence Olivier's masterpiece "Henry V.")</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the expressions of the actors, I heard someone suggest that Han Yu Niang has many scenes of weeping and must learn the stage play's way of looking up to the sky and shouting, and follow the film's way of tears streaming down her face, in order to meet the conditions of realism. Shi Xi does not think so. The highest artistic realm of all fine arts lies in reaching the traceless from the traceable, and transcending the imageless from the imageful, which is considered precious. The advantage of Peking Opera is that it can use abstract and freehand ways to perform the facts, so that the viewers can understand it intuitively and have an inexhaustible aftertaste. Those who have a little dramatic knowledge, both Chinese and foreigners, can generally understand this. (Qi Rushan's "Mei Lanfang's Tour of America" contains a very detailed account.) If it is not so, and everything is shown with realistic depiction, then everything is exhausted, becomes shallow, and is no longer art. Therefore, what I hope from Mr. Mei is that the expressions should follow the old stage practices, without any need for change. I discussed this with Professor Chen Meng'an yesterday, and he also strongly supported this idea.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding props (commonly known as "Qie Mo"), I think it is acceptable to follow the original Peking Opera objects and refine them. Still use horse whips and hair tossing, etc., without the need to set up doors and windows. Otherwise, the art of each character cannot be expressed. (For example, when Mr. Jiang Miaoxiang escapes from the Jin Dynasty, he has the superb skill of tossing his hair. Mr. Mei Lanfang's opening and closing of doors and windows have extremely beautiful hand gestures to show.) It also does not conform to the noble principle of freehand brushwork in Peking Opera. If everything must be realistic, then it is no different from a "Lianhe Benxi" (a series of plays), and the knowledgeable people of the country will despise it.</p>
<p>(6) In terms of plot, "Life and Death Hate" is already a famous play that has been repeatedly tempered, so there is no objection. However, the seizure and forced marriage of Cheng Pengju and Han Yu Niang, although both are explained in the opening lines of Cheng Pengju and Zhang Dahao, are still criticized for being implicit rather than explicit. I heard that Fei Mu is re-editing several scenes and adding them to the front, depicting Zhang Dahao's treatment of prisoners like dogs and sheep, and Cheng Pengju's concern for his great ambitions and unwillingness to marry into the Jin Dynasty. This is indeed what I wanted. I once told the Ping Opera critic Su Shaoqing about this, and he also praised it greatly.</p>
<p>(7) Mr. Mei is fifty-five years old this year. If his lifelong hard work and refined skills can be preserved forever through the power of film, and become a model for future generations, this is indeed a great thing. However, everyone has their limitations, and Mr. Mei has no decades of experience in film. If he abandons his inherent superb skills in Peking Opera and forcibly incorporates them into the rules of film, it would be like using Chu talents in Jin, or cutting feet to fit shoes. In my spare time from seeing patients, I am fascinated by Peking Opera, and I am writing to protect Peking Opera because I firmly believe that this is not possible. If the script of "Life and Death Hate" is suitable for the film genre, then are there no people in the film industry who are qualified for this role? Why must Mr. Mei be used as an experiment? For the sake of Mr. Mei's reputation, I also hope that all the contemporary lovers of Mei will carefully reconsider and handle this matter well.</p>

<p>— Wu Zong Can</p>
<p>In a previous article in this publication, "Mr. Yiyun's 清代試塲話弊" (Talks on the Malpractices of the Imperial Examination Market in the Qing Dynasty), it was mentioned that a certain top scholar (狀元) had not finished writing his palace examination paper when it became dark. A certain minister ordered someone to light a paper candle so that he could complete the paper. The so-called "certain top scholar" is Li Pan (Genda) from my hometown, Xuzhou. Pan passed the Kangxi Gengwu year provincial examination (舉人) and became the top scholar of the Dingchou year palace examination, and was appointed as a compiler (修撰) in the Hanlin Academy. On the day of the palace examination, he brought cakes with him. Pan was tall and dark-faced, and his writing ability was usually slow. It was almost noon, but he had not yet finished his paper. According to the rules, the papers were to be collected, but Pan pleaded, "My entire life's success depends on this examination." A certain minister took pity on him and lit a paper candle for him. Pan took out the cakes he had brought and ate them while writing, finally finishing the paper and leaving. The Holy Ancestor (Emperor Kangxi) vaguely heard about this and said, "He is also a hard-working scholar." When the paper was presented, he was promoted to first place. People at the time called him the "Cake-Bearing Top Scholar." Jiang Chenying from Cixi also became a Jinshi (進士) of the first class, third place in the same examination. In the early Qing Dynasty, following the Ming system, the chief examiner (正主考) of the Shunzhi Heavenly Examination was the top scholar of the previous examination. Pan, according to the rules, presided over the Kangxi Jimao year Shunzhi Heavenly Examination, with Chenying as his deputy. After the list was announced, the censor Lu You accused them of unfair examination practices. After investigation, Pan was exiled, and Chenying was implicated and imprisoned. He was not given a verdict and died in prison. Chenying was a famous old scholar in Jiangnan, and he was over seventy years old when he died. People at the time mourned him and said, "Old Ginger is not necessarily truly spicy, Little Li has a great sweetness." After Pan died, he was buried in Black Stone Gorge south of Xuzhou City. Today, in front of the Xima Pool, there is a mansion of the top scholar, and the plaque on the door still exists. The descendants of the Li family live in it, but they are in decline.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Ice Cream <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>In 1809, the black female cook of the wife of the fourth U.S. President Madison, Sadie J. Hoesen, was actually accused of intending to poison Mrs. Madison's guests by inventing ice cream and was arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Once, a banquet was suddenly canceled, and Sadie put some cream cakes in the refrigerator to cool and store. Two days later, another banquet was held, and she brought out the cakes from the refrigerator to serve the guests, not knowing that they had already frozen.</p>
<p>A nervous guest took a bite and shouted, "Poison!" He hurriedly spat out the ice cake and demanded the arrest of the cook. As a result, Sadie was immediately wrongfully imprisoned. The other guests saw this and scattered like frightened birds and beasts. Afterwards, Mrs. Madison decided to carefully test the cake herself to see if it was poisonous. She tasted it mouthful after mouthful and greatly praised the taste of this frozen cake. So she used her power to bail Sadie out.</p>
<p>The next day, Sadie quickly froze the cake in the kitchen, and her salary was increased by five dollars a month. After this original ice cream was introduced and recommended by Mrs. Madison, every embassy in Washington served ice cream at banquets before the end of the year.</p>
<p>However, the true origin of ice cream is much earlier. When Marco Polo returned to Europe from the East six hundred years ago, he brought back a recipe for making "ice water," which had been used in Asia for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Even today, some countries still make ice cream in a way similar to that of the Roman tyrant Nero. Nero sent groups of slaves to the mountains to fetch ice and snow to chill his delicacies and wines. In modern Romania, "ice men" still collect ice blocks in winter and store them in pits covered with branches, which they take out and use in summer.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, natural ice overwhelms manufactured ice. The ice comes from the local Popocatepetl Mountain. At the 15,000-foot peak, snow and ice accumulate year-round. Local people lay pipes on the mountain. Whenever the sun is strongest, the snow and ice melt and flow down the pipes into containers at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>When sunset comes and the temperature drops, the snow water in the containers freezes again. The next time the sun comes out, people expose the containers to the sun slightly to loosen the ice blocks, then pour them out and transport them to ice shops, which sell this natural ice to ice cream shops throughout the city.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Non-Contention <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Gongsun Wu</p>
<p>The "Confucian Conduct" praises Confucian scholars for "not contending for advantages in easy or dangerous paths, and not contending for harmony between yin and yang in winter and summer." Contending for one's own benefit will inevitably disadvantage others. If everyone seeks their own benefit, there will be endless contention. Those with virtue can refrain from greed when facing wealth, and think of righteousness when seeing profit. Even sages sometimes cannot avoid contending for small advantages out of selfishness. Confucius cited these two matters to illustrate Confucian conduct, saying that a heart that does not tolerate falsehood, and does not lose its adherence even in small actions, is a true Confucian. Reflect on oneself and observe others, and pay attention to these aspects, and one will not go astray. Some say that Confucius's teachings can only work if the whole world becomes gentlemen, otherwise, only make sure that the world has benefits and no harm, and contention will naturally cease. But this is impossible. Today, the theory of the struggle for survival has penetrated deeply into people's hearts. Talk of struggle and contention is constantly heard. Those who adhere to the doctrine of struggle, if they do not contend for advantages in easy or dangerous paths, or for harmony between yin and yang, where do they place themselves? Those who speak of order wish to stop war and prevent chaos. Those who maintain order may abide by it for a while, but if there is any injustice, contention will arise again. Confucius's teachings are increasingly attacked by people today. Where there is life, there is contention. Why does even a great sage not know this? The worries of the one who made the Book of Changes lie in 生生 (continuous generation). If 生生 does not cease, contention will also be endless. Even if there is a state of Xiaokang (moderate prosperity), it is difficult to achieve Taiping (great peace). This principle is easy to understand, and Confucius clearly stated it. If there is a way to not contend, to make people cherish their lives, people will surely be happy to follow it. Recently, there have been many discussions about Confucianism. Humanity is suffering from contention. I wonder if there are any scholars who are exploring the root of the problem.</p>

<p>Mr. Mo Zhongliang has served in the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway for forty years. This year, he is over sixty, but he is still as sharp and strong as before. I wrote two poems for the statue to commemorate his past achievements, and it is not without a sense of the past and present:</p>
<p>Starting out at a young age, I have worked hard for forty years; relying on the masters for guidance, I have made a compilation for the rail.</p>
<p>The turtledove perches on a branch, the old steed aspires to travel thousands of miles; do not compose a song of old age, for your merits are worthy of being recorded in history.</p>
<p>Sharing the same illness, we are still restricted for a day at a time, bearing to discuss the fleeting years with mushrooms and trees. Returning home, I dream of the three paths overgrown, how much is 断 楮文 (broken paper writings) worth today! I still remember the past talks turning into illusions, is it possible to obtain new compilations? Mending bones and reviving the disabled are all leisurely matters, but I am still happy to use virtue to make everything whole.</p>
