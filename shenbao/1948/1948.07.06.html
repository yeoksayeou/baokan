<h3>美援二期配額　將以棉花為主　嚴家淦來滬商經建專款問題</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓四日合衆電〕據美經濟合作局高級人士稱：七月至九月期間經濟合作局對華之新配物資中，將有大量棉花。在四月至七月之第一期中，對華分配物資三分之一為糧食，故第二期中糧食配額將佔少數，此乃由於農產物即可割收。在南京簽訂之經濟合作協定中，對配給制度改進，業有所規定，故關於此點將獲得新保證。又據宣佈稱，在史蒂爾曼工業調查組可望於八月一日完成其工作前，分配物資中，將不致有建設物資或主要生產工具。經濟合作局負責分配中國物資之官員，刻仍審核未來新期間內分配之物資品名，而尙未決定數量。但顯然將超過現甫告結束之第一個三月期間中價值三千六百萬美元之配額。經濟合作局方面透露稱：該局擬處理中國與紡織工業公司間尙未履行之所有購棉合同，全數共達四千萬美元，經濟合作局將直接配運價值三千萬美元之棉花，餘數則由中國政府供應處理。此種購美棉之合同在前一期間中，已開有先例。當時經濟合作局處理此種合同，總值計達一千五百萬美元。據專家稱：經濟合作局於最晚延宕配運主要生產工具期間，准配運零件以便修理中國現有之主要生產工具。此等零件將根據遴選原則處理。經濟合作局刻在覆行中國各工業本身所提出，經由中國政府所送達之訂貨單，然經濟合作局將以此等零件，列名為「貨品」，而非「主要生產工具」。據當局稱，在新期中，經濟合作局其他將告啓運之大量貨物，將為肥料及食米。後者大部來自暹羅，雖則其先希望能自緬甸購得肥料，大多來自英比二國，經濟局原望能自此二國多量採購肥料，但困難係在中國缺乏英鎊外匯。同時經濟合作局深願儘量以金鎊在外採購肥料，以避免運出美國農民迫切需要之美國肥料。經濟合作局官員稱：「肥料供應實為吾人為使糧食增產而能使用之最佳辦法，此對稻米增產甚為有效，但此種方法除合灣一省外，，不大在中國使用。」其他糧運將包括小麥，麵粉，但預料此等食糧運額，將較第一期中運額為低。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕美援運用委會聯絡專員嚴家淦五日晚夜車赴滬，主要任務係與賴普漢商談美援中六八千萬美元經濟建設專款，是否改動問題美國會援華方案措定以六千萬美元充作中國經濟建設之用時，援華貸款總額為四億六千三百萬美元，現巳核减為四億美元，故六千萬之數有無變動，尙須由雙方商洽決定。嚴氏已接獲政府之指示，聞賴普漢亦將向霍夫曼請示。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州五日電〕史蒂爾曼調查團由韓士登領導交倍雷，茅以昇等一行同來，下午五時許抵杭後稍息即參觀錢江大橋，韓氏為美國立虛門鐵路總工程師，為美國極著盛譽之運輸專家。氏對大橋工程頗多贊美。渠等定六日晨搭車赴南昌視察東南大動脈浙贛鐵路。</p>

<h3>社論　對日和會擱淺的癥結</h3>
<p>最近立監兩院開會，均曾提出召開對日和會的主張，並建議我國政府採取主動外交，為召開和會而努力。民間與論方面，對於這個富有建設性的主張，亦莫不報以熱烈的歡迎，僉認日本問題的淸算，唯有和會的召開，纔能獲得澈底的澄淸。外交當局方面，對於這個問題的態度很議嚴，六月四日外次葉公超對中央社記者發表談話，表示了我國政府的態度。葉氏談話的要點有二：（一）列舉和會初步會議交涉的經過，說明美·英·蘇態度的分歧，我國在各種交涉中，曾盡其應盡的責任。過去如此，今後亦當本一貫立塲，繼續企求對日和約之早日成立。（二）對日和約草案，我政府自日本投降後，即不斷有所準備，且作探入之研討，如和會召開有期，我國的和約草案，即可立即提出。照葉氏的說法，我國政府不僅對和會之召開，已盡其應盡之責任，而且對於和約草案，也早有縝密的準備。和會初步會議之擱淺未開，我國自無責任可言。</p>
<p>「和約」是交戰國家回復雙方和平關係的文件，國際戰爭的終結，英不循取締結和約的常規方式，很少有例外情事。所以說，和約是戰爭的最後一章。第二次世界大戰後，對德對日兩大和約，尙未締結；對德對日兩大和會，均以程序問題的紛爭，而擱淺了和會的召集。和約是由和會議定產生的文書，和會召開無期，和約致無從締結，這是必然的現象。和會為什麽不能召開？戰後兩年多的事實，充分說明强權政治的抬頭，美蘇兩大集團的對立，已陷整個國際政治於猜忌疑懼的恐怖狀態中。以實對德和會，四國外長會議多次商討無結果，甚至連和會程序問題，蘇聯也拒絕中國有參加的權利。和會程序充滿了複雜陰沉的現象，自然談不到和約實質內容了。此在對日和會，中·美·英·蘇四國對於程序問題就有三種不同的歧見：美英主張遠東委員會十一個對日作戰國家，共同起草對日和約，依三分之二的多數，成立決議；蘇聯主張中·英·美·蘇四國外長會議負責和約起草及和會的召開，并保有四國的否決權；我國折衷上述兩項歧見，主張十一國參加和會初步會議，但會議中通過議案之多數應包括中·美·英·蘇四國在內。美英蘇對我國的意見，互有懸殊，遂致將近一年的談判迄未順利完成。這並非我國未盡努力斡旋之責，實由於美蘇之間難獲協議，美蘇坐失早日召開和會的良機。</p>
<p>美蘇對於日本和會所爭的，是否決權問題，是和會程序間題，尙未涉獵和約草案的內容。本來和約是實質，和會是形式，從理論上說，實質的內容自比形式格外重要；可是盟國的政洽家，今天就不惜爭論形式而疏忽內容，這是何等的遺憾！我國政府對和會的形式，有一定的立塲，對於和約內容，也早有充分的準備，從未為美蘇「冷戰」的險惡現象所搖動。大體說來，我國的態度是比較堅定的，而且具有一貫的作風。我國這種堅定不移的態度，比較英國進步多了；老謀深算的貝文外相，對於日本和會召開問題的處置，他已經向世界自承其錯誤失敗。當去年十一月，我政府為打開和會僵局，曾向美英蘇提出通牒，調合美蘇分歧的意見，而冀求一折衷辦法，藉以促進和會的成功。可怪的是：英國對於我國折衷方案，不但未加採納，反而咀咒起來，怨聲四起。極有聲光的倫敦泰晤士報，今年一月六日社評竟指我國「拒絕和西方强國採取同一立塲」。甚至澳大利亞官方，也對我國折衷案予以攻擊，可惜之至！乃曾幾何時，澳大利亞便改換論調，大聲疾呼召開對日和會了，英外相貝文在工黨年會的演說和他在國會中的外交報告也充分流露要求對日和會召開之迫切，泰晤士報的論說，更與半年前逈然不問了。</p>
<p>以上列舉的事實，說明我國態度的堅定不移，英國態度的猶豫不決，半年多的事實發展，說明我國立塲的正確性，毫未為國際冷戰的險象所搖動。假如去年十一月我國的折衷方案，英國予以支持，美蘇決無異議的接受，對日和會初步會議便不會擱淺到今天了。現在，美蘇的冷戰日趨劇烈化，美國扶日政策有趨於歧途的危險，英澳等國深感惶懼，為遠東和平前途憂，這能說不是英國錯誤的自招麽？</p>
<p>總之，我國五十年來深受日本侵略主義的殘害與茶毒，人無分老幼，地無分南北，職無分官民，莫不人同此心，心同此理，要求早日締結對日和約，公正而澈底的淸算日本問題，從而樹立遠東百年和平的大計。我們讀了葉次長的談話，我們認為我國對日和會堅定立塲，是萬分正確的；但為了國家安全和遠東和平，仍希望政府當局編續促開對日和約初步會議的實現，並以主動精神應付對日和約諸問題，以副全國人士之期望。同時也希望全國人士一致為政府的後盾，以全力支持政府的對日政策，應付這複雜多變的國際環境。</p>

<p>另一任務爲硏究申匯之開放問題，同人等與當地有關人士詳盡硏討後，深感過去申匯限制甚嚴，而現鈔仍源源私運，故申匯是否開放，已無甚關係，問題在如何疏導華北之游資，使有正當之出路。東北流通券在平津之兌換，已於上月廿八日由動總下令停止，惟悉此舉乃尊重當地民意機關之意旨，藉以應付一時之物價波動而採取者。按流通券之入關，乃關內外物價水準不同下之自然現象，目前申匯旣合理開放，當能减輕游資對平津之壓力。今後當在兼顧東北華北利益之原則下，對流通券之兌換問題，於短期內定一完善之方案。</p>
<p>糧食問題</p>
<p>此行附帶處理之迫切事項，爲華北之糧食問題。爲抑平當地之糧價起見，除已由政府運輸麵粉前往拋售外，此行並已與傳總司令商定原則，由央行以紗布向察綏兩省易取雜糧，供應華北需要，而避免用現款在華北當地收購，而致刺激糧價。至於一切推行上之技術問題，則由央行華北區鄭主任負責與剿總協商解決。</p>

<h3>路局接送汽車　沿途不再搭客</h3>
<p>係遵照公用局規定</p>
<p>京滬鐵路局在市區行駛之接客汽車，拒絕沿途搭客，致遭外間非議。據該局負責人對記者談稱：該局在市區行駛之接客汽車，共有九輛，行駛路綫有三，一爲北站至靜安寺，二爲北站至中正南二路，三爲北站至漁市塲，因前經市公用局規定，凡由站送客至市區之汽事，祗許旅客下車，不許上車，而由市區接客到站之汽車，祗許旅客上車，不許下車，此係遵守政府之法令，但肚會人士不明底蘊，對此有所實難，甚爲抱歉云。</p>
<h3>中航中美空綫改道　將以東京作中途站</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司中美航綫擬改道經過東京，該公司駐東京辦事處與盟軍總部協商後，盟總已應允中航　在東京作「技術性降落」，惟不得起卸客貨。明日（七日）該公司中美班機即將循新航綫以東京爲中途站，而不必經過關島，如此可縮短航程五百英里，節省汽油二百加侖。惟此次僅係初步試騐性質，正式改道，尙待中美政府外交協議。又該公司中日航綫與中美綫改道並無關係，前者係以東京爲終點而可作客貨營業，該航綫目前月試航後，因尙有若十小問題未解決，故遲遲未能開航。</p>
<h3>中航減少班機　聲明苦衷三點</h3>
<p>據中國航空公司稱：自該公司若干航綫班機减少後，各地一般人士頗感不便，紛紛來電要求恢復或增加班次，福州航站且有乘客因此與售票員一度發生糾紛。惟公司方面實因：（一）政府所定購油外匯限額不够，（二）票價過低，營業收入不能担負購油開支，（三）結匯問題尙無具體辦法。不得已始有减班之決定。須俟上列情形改善，始能考慮恢復。至盼社會各界予以諒解云。</p>

<h3>京江公所　坍屋慘劇　各界捐款　療傷殮死</h3>

<h3>反對撤銷漁管處　電立院秉公處斷</h3>
<p>全體技術人員請派大員澈查</p>
<p>漁業善後物資管理處全體技術人員代表，爲反對少數漁商倡議撤銷漁管處，昨日急電立法院請求秉公處斷，派大員來滬澈査，並招待新聞界發表該處工作眞相。茲將呈立法院之原電錄後：</p>
<p>立法院秘書處轉委員諸公鈞陰；近有少數漁商假偕名義，以漁管處壟斷漁業救濟物資爲詞，倡議撤銷漁管處，冀達分獲漁輪之私願，同人等獲悉之餘，不勝詫異。査漁業救濟善後物資之分配，最一近已由善後事業委員會，定期本月十九日，召集各省代表商討各項實施細則，並已登報公吿配售第一批漁輪，故漁管處目前之任務，祗能秉承上峯之意旨執行，無權可以左右。同人等以漁業技術人員資格，參加漁管處工作已兩年於茲，此兩年來，如美式拖網之運用，靑島圍網試騐之成功，高雄新式釣魚業之拓展，東京灣漁塲之開關，以及各項加工廠之積極籌建，對我國新式漁業之推進，自問不無貢獻。倘漁業少數投機份子之企圖得以貫澈，則必使此項粗具規模之生產事業，瀕於瓦解之境，斷喪國本，莫此為甚。同人等一息尙存，誓必與之周旋，素仰諸公負國家重責，匡濟時艱，務懇秉公處斷，迅派大員來滬澈査，以明眞相，不僅漁管處之行政措施，得以判明，即假借名義之漁業團體，是否以獲取漁業物資爲對象，亦應在澈査之列，庶免狡猾桀點者流，計謀獲售，則我國新式漁業前送實利賴之，國家幸甚。漁業善後物資管理處全體技術人員代表余餛，陳叔易，蔣桐森，莊景奎，楊汝梅（以上船長代表），石毓彬·陳明生·王浩鑫·金沛發·劉雨生（以上輪機長代表），陳修白（加工廠代表），劉景漢（網廠代表），陳開惠（以上漁勞員代表）同叩午支。</p>
<p>必須政府機關方能負此重任</p>
<p>各技術人員代表昨日午後五時招待記者，由船長王歆序·楊汝梅·網廠劉景漢·輪機長金沛發·總艦長余琨，先後報吿該處工作情况。並稱：關於物資之配售工作，固應迅速合　實施，但爲整個漁業着想，必須留一部份漁輪及全部加工設備，以完成其開發新漁業及水產加工業等工作，此項如期完成後，我國整個漁業方能有望振興，魚產之輸出換取外匯，因漁輪之主要器材尙需仰賴於國外，倘無魚產輸出，則中國漁業將永遠無法達到富裕，國計民生之地步，但此項開發後，試驗工作，將需相當財力·人力·物力之配合，方克有成，故必須政府機關辦理，決不能奢望民營公司負此責任，故漁管處仍應存在云云。</p>
<h3>西片停供後的風波　國片廠商互爭地盤　多數影院賣座甚慘　難免仍向洋商低頭</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕僵持已達週餘之影院業與西片商間之停片糾紛，因雙方意見始終無法接近，迄昨止仍未能解決。自上月二十九日起，各西片商停供新片後，本市首輪影院即自動調整票價，營業方針亦分爲兩派：大光明，美琪，大華，國泰等戯院仍繼續放映舊片，南京，大上海等戲院則改向若干較小西片廠商洽換影片，結果前者仍可客滿，而後者賣座竟不足三成。根據各影院調查硏究報吿，認爲票價提高、一般購實力减退，且影院地址互異，固係造成營業顯著參差之主要原因，但觀衆對影片內容之選擇與愛惡，仍爲決定影院營業之基本原因。故渠等在無法獲得優級新西片之苦悶下，頗有意與國產片商訂定合同，以冀挽回危局。惟本市十二家製片廠商，又因爭奪地盤，互以設備較優之影院爲目標，各不相下，遂使前波未平，暗潮又起。據各首輪影院表示：目前尙有一問題，即西片商嫌票價太低，謂不數成本，而　片商則嫌界價太高，謂難以招致觀衆，影院已被逼無路可走，故將來如國片商本身間糾紛不能解決，則渠等爲自己營業打算，紙有向西片商低頭，再度要求合作。聞此事正由社會局召集影院業，西片商，國片商三方面會商解決辦法中。</p>
<h3>申報繼續舉辦助學　今起開始勸募基金</h3>
<p>申報讀者助學金委員會，鑑於近來物價暴漲，民生凋敝，預料下學年各校學費激增，淸寒學生失學情形，勢將愈形股重。特於日閃召集會議，一致通過續辦本年秋學助學金，以濟助優秀靑年之失學。決定自今日起，徵募助學金，至九月底截止，目標定一百億元。所望各界讀者，有力出力，有錢出錢，共同奮起，協力勸募。諸凡婚喪喜慶，均能節約助學；工商集團，共體時艱，節游樂之靡費，充助學之基金；意義深長，莫善於此，該會爲保持幣值及優厚生息起見，擬將所收助學捐款，購買短期庫券，隨時公佈，以昭大信。</p>

<h3>台省三義茶塲　塲長侵佔鉅欵　棄職逃港來滬就逮　押候臺地檢處迎提</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕合灣省農林股份有限公司茶葉分公司所屬三義茶塲塲長，係粵人沈達，現年二十八歲，自去年九月到任後，即委其妻沈張蘊爲該茶塲之專員兼出納。當就任之初，適該茶塲開始種植香水茅茶種，預算台幣約四五〇萬元，此款不久即由該塲向公司領到後，擬分貸於一般茶農，惟當時茶農因尙朱至需用時期，故此款一直由該茶塲加以保管。詎沈達恰因與友朋合夥經商失敗，虧蝕甚巨，竟暗由將此款陸續挪用彌補，結果至年底時爲公司當局發覺，沈達於聞知風聲後，深恐事敗被捕，乃於本年一月間棄職逃往香港，不敢露面，其妻則因事已先沈於十一月問離台來滬。此案發生後，該公司立即派總務科長陶詩詠來滬，至沈達之父沈兆熊處交涉，惟沈父以服務於南洋企業公司，所入菲薄，實無力償還此筆鉅款，致一再延宕，至本年五月問猶未解決。時沈達在港極感苦悶，乃亦潛行來滬，居住於虹口海寗路三二八弄廿三號內，事爲台省警務處得公司報吿獲悉，即電本市警局請求逮捕，旋由警局於五月廿六日按址將沈拘獲，經轉解地檢處後，於上月五日開庭偵訊，沈對挪用公款等情，供認不諱，該處正擬提起公訴時，忽接台省地檢處來函，稱此案已加受理，擬請將沈移送至台，故地檢處現已將此案擱置，雖屢經函催，惟迄今尙未見合省地檢處派員來滬提解云。</p>

<h3>冀東戰局前奏　搶麥狂潮</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>〔本報秦皇島一日航訊〕六月中，麥穗黄遍了冀東原野，農民們的血汗辛勞，結成了活命的果實，是收成的時候了，但，就在這時發生了不幸的「搶麥戰爭」，同時它也正是這次整個冀東全面戰事的前奏。</p>
<p>最初，共匪地方武力，大事徵集剪刀，担筐，　騾，大車，編組男女搶麥大隊，由着地方武力掩護，進入麥田，沿着麥　，專前麥穗，一畝畝的很快的就剪光了，一筐筐的麥穗，駃的馱，拉的拉，運回匪區去。</p>
<p>這樣大規模的打搶，騷亂，弄得農民們半年辛苦，化歸烏有，民食發生了問題，國軍和地方團隊，本來也有保護麥收的計劃，但終因運用不靈活，再加上匪的利用迫使國軍和地方團隊進入點綫防守的弱點，匪得從容的打搶，無怪農民吃虧和地方損失太大了。</p>
<p>吃小據點</p>
<p>在沒捲起搶麥狂浪的時候，打承德的林彪第八縱隊，第十一縱隊，以及聶榮臻第四縱隊，第二縱隊第四旅等部，急急竄進長城，由聶能等部爲先，攻取華北工礦基地唐山和古冶等地，沒有佔着便宜，一是再定攻襲冀東鐵路綫全面大小據點計劃。</p>
<p>匪的計劃，先吃冀東鐵路綫上的小據點，再拿大據點，爲了左右逢源，西面在石門以北胡家黄嶺設了一個指揮所，東面在秦皇島西十五公里大小深港設一個指揮所，分頭攻打昌黎東西地區。</p>
<p>灤河以東，是由聶匪第四縱隊的第十旅攻石門，十一旅攻安山十二旅攻後封台，第二縱隊第四旅，作機動部隊，林匪的第八縱隊，附屬獨砲團，騎兵營，攻取昌黎，其餘地方武力像第十二軍分區獨二·三國及十三軍分區獨九團，和各縣大隊等則分別配合作戰。</p>
<p>林匪第十一縱隊，　在了昌黎以東，攻打北戴河留守營，並策應昌黎犯匪，然後再圖秦皇島，匪部署完成，開始由盧龍和撫寗第地，向南移動，廿三日的上午，已到達鐵道以北較大據點，夜間靠近鐵路，午夜後開始攻擊，日期是廿四日了，經過了五六小時的戰鬥，西面匪攻陷昌黎以西的後封台·安山·石門等站，中路昌黎有激戰，東路攻下靠昌黎的陳家莊小站，而留守營·北戴河·則由交警十二總隊堅守，屹然未被動搖。</p>
<p>昌黎的戰事，先在周圍打，守城交警和匪打了一天，廿四日下午，被迫撤離四郊和山頭堡壘，堅守城池和車站，南郊的虹橋，縣保安團隊，和匪打了一個硬仗，後來不支，擬退人城內，守城交警，這時已堵塞了城門，保安國隊遂轉道去灤縣</p>
<p>守城的交警是第五和第八總隊，多持「湯姆生」等新槍機，昌黎城內的工事也花了很多的錢，修筑的很像樣，守軍缺乏的僅爲重武器，匪第八縱隊，整夜攻城，砲火頗密，廿五日拂曉前，北門先被突破，繼而東西兩門也有匪竄入，交警大部撤至南門，準備撤退，據逃出的老百姓說：「交警支隊司令湯毅生對兩個總隊長說：昌黎要守，你們看我湯某自戕後再撤退，」惜因大勢已去，大部交警由南門突圍了，廿五日上午十一時，匪得控制了整個城垣，昌黎繼去年五月十八日，再度被匪侵踞。</p>
<p>昌黎一帶</p>
<p>昌黎以東的戰事，國軍實力雖弱，但戰事延續最久，也可以說國軍在這方面相當的成功，成功的原因，除了守軍堅强外，援軍到達迅速，范漢傑坐鎭秦皇島指揮，當然有很大的關係。</p>
<p>這方面戰事，開始是這樣的；在六月廿三日以前，關外錦楡鐵道首先被截斷，軍事當局雖然不斷的接到這裏發現匪幾千，那裏又發現幾千匪的報吿，但都認爲不很正確，僅作了開始注意的準備。</p>
<p>到了廿三日上午，保安團隊捉到了幾個匪，由於匪的口供中，當局知道不同尋常了，遂傳令各地加緊戒備，夜間匪接近了鐵路，廿四日午前二時，正當月明星稀的時候，秦皇島外圍響起了槍砲聲，後來在緊密槍砲聲裏，還間雜着爆炸聲，於是西起灤河，東至秦皇島，長約二百華里的綫上，全綫發生戰事。</p>
<p>廿四日的上午，是東面戰事最緊張的時期，奏皇島以西九公里的南大寺小站，戰事最烈，海軍也不斷開砲，這時秦皇島被砲聲籠罩了，當局爲了使匪遠離，特在南大寺設指揮所，由冀熱遼邊區剿匪副總司令何世禮，親自指揮，在先屢有進退，後來稍稍得勢，入夜何更乘鐵路小型甲車前進督戰，到了廿五日上午，葫蘆島開來援軍，士氣益盛，但匪在北戴河南大寺間鐵道以北的「慕　寨」和「蔡各莊」頑抗，再經過廿五和廿六兩天的鏖戰，纔把匪打退了，北戴河和秦皇島，得能聯成一起，打成一片。</p>
<p>廿七和廿八的兩天，國軍再向前進，驅逐北戴河到留守營間鐵一道以北之匪，匪動搖了，開始北退，因爲國軍採取東西夾擊戰術，由古冶東進國軍第八軍等部，廿七日收復石門，廿八日下安山，廿九日入後封寺，緊接著收復了陷匪五天的昌黎縣城。原定廿八日東西兩路國軍會師昌黎，終因東面阻力太大，東路於廿九日午克陳家莊車站後，下午纔得和兩路國軍會師了，冀東戰事至此算是吿一段落</p>
<p>北寗路津榆段灤河以東，破壞很重，所幸大家關心的「灤河大橋」因有重兵把守，僅中匪方數砲，損失尙小，很快的修復了，其他的橋樑，有的搭臨時便橋，有的架設枕木，一般設備，則易設法，大約七月三四日就可搶通了，鐵路人員的損失，現在知道的有陳家莊車站王副站長等人均以身殉，也有的被擄後放回來了。</p>
<p>這次戰後，昌黎損失最大，匪搶了許多物資，也得了許多武器，在昌黎以西灤河以東區域，搶麥更多，據空軍偵察，匪用大車數百輛，向北拉運物資，數量是相當的可觀了，不過匪在昌黎，以及昌黎以東和以西地區，死傷都很多，匪只要得到物資，死傷些人是不在乎的。</p>

<h3>長沙古物出土記</h3>
<p>— 蔣玄佁</p>
<p>〔本報長沙一日航訊〕湖南長沙市，除了湘江北岸狹小一點，其四郊多是黄土起伏的平原，當初爲了建築新市區，將南門外土崗掘發平基的時候，發現了一穴漢人屋宇式的大墓，其中有門三重，可以進出無阻，其高大可知。其後，郊外窰工，於偶然掘土燒磚，又發現了一坐中形漢墓，工伕以爲土中有寳可掘，將這一座漢墓，連底起去，東翻西掘，又掘着了硬硬的木塊。</p>
<p>墓穴生煙</p>
<p>這種木塊長可丈餘，重約千斤，無法起運，祗得將其一一翻閱，大木之下，却爲木板，木板初起嗤嗤有聲，轟然一聲，全穴生烟，因而受傷者二人，古物商齊某，即因此入獄，而墓中遺物亦四處散失，這種大木槨墓，便是所謂周代的楚墓了。當時因爲在抗戰時期，外界知者甚少，祗有明眼的美國人柯强先生，收集了大批珍貴奇異材料運往美國耶魯大學展覽，爲了物件奇異，延期展覽了三週。此後商錫永先生留居長沙一年，也收得不少，除此以外，就沒人有系統的收集。</p>
<p>掘井盜寶</p>
<p>以上的二次古墓發現，祗可算是一個開端，此後六七年來，因爲長沙有物出土，東站路上，開店設攤的古物，特然發達，由一二家一時增爲五十餘家，窰工土伕就以此爲業，投資商人藉職務營私者，串動土伕，禮聘河南掘寶導師，於是開始發展了大規模的盜掘，河南的掘寶導師，可以用一枝鐵釬，在地上打下數尺，視其泥色就可知道地下有否寶器或古墳。掘寶土人，根據這個原理，便掘下一個一公尺不到小井，由井中穿進地下五六丈以外的古墓，去搜進十餘担奇怪的古董。</p>
<p>掘墳百座</p>
<p>小小的加以估計，掘去的墳墓至少在一百座以上，掘出的物件，至少在萬件以上，謂予不信，祗要在長沙市東站路上參觀二十家古物攤，便可得到一個概念了。這些古物値不値大錢，是另一個問題，但湖南人忠樸可愛，沒有把假古董搬上市塲，却是事實。</p>
<p>掘井盜寶是鄕下人的掘法，美人柯先生是用科學發掘法，去泥平土，將全部墳墓建築以及陳設情形，全部發掘出來，本地有勢力的人士，也有模仿着這種方法，撳開天窗說亮話的，將墳墓全部掘了出來。不過柯氏發掘，有記錄，有攝影，當時土人的發掘，無非當時看過明白，並無記錄可考。因爲有以上的兩種掘法，大家知道，土中有墓，墓下還有墓，最多的是上下三層，由此知道三層墳墓，屬於三個時代，最下一層墓，爲泥沙掩沒了又葬上面一層墓。根據窰工土伕的談話，並從遺物上觀察，長沙的古基羣，自戰國以至唐·宋·明·淸·多有。可惜的，是發現的形狀，無人爲之記錄。不久以前，還可在長沙市上，看到不少古物，眞是各色各樣，應有盡有，但在銅鏡，漆器上的花紋，却是與衆不同，因此，我決意收集了一些別人不要的殘餘破古董，費了一些時候，爲他摹出了復原的形狀和花紋，又將研究的記錄，寫成了厚厚的兩册專書。</p>
<p>墓穴形制</p>
<p>關於這些墓穴的形制，大約可分爲二種：第一種爲大塊方木條重重疊成的木槨，大木截斷處，有包以銀或錫皮，其用意如今日的塗柏汕，槨外堆滿了廢灰如山，將木槨全部封存。第二種爲泥築牆垣之土槨。從這二種形式上，不能斷定那一形式爲某一年代，不過第一墓式的木槨，因封存得周密，始能保存木器·漆器·織物等奇異的古物。</p>
<p>掘取殘余</p>
<p>老百姓最初是偶然發現，其後是有計劃盜掘，有權有勢的不妨是大掘特掘。聽說城西有一座古代某皇妃的墓址，爲文獻上有訊錄的漢墓，這一個漢墓，經過好些人去試掘，至現在還未掘到。關於盜掘，政府亦曾加以禁止，並且沒收古物數百件，但事過境遷，這些本地人，不但新掘大墓，而且將已掘過而未取盡的古墳，再來一次二次三次的穿洞而入，摸取殘餘。這種盜掘方法，是先開一井狀的洞，井內兩邊可以站人，如此至開深時，則隔二尺立一人，將底部泥土掘起遞第二人第三人，以至入墓爲止。掘墓人第一可貴者爲金器，次爲銅器，所以古代的破衣·破甲·破鞋`之類，都給人糟蹋了。這些遺物之中，可分木器·漆器·織物·銅器·鐵器·石器·玻璃·琥珀·瑪瑙·火漆·雄黄·玉·瓷·陶·金·銀。爲了篇幅關係，古物出土的情形容後再述。長沙掘獲古鏡（蔣玄佁攝）</p>

<h3>前句容縣府主任秘書　王為民荒淫失金磚</h3>
<p>〔本報句容四日訊〕石啓民貪污案的另一要犯王爲民，（石前任內主任秘書）五月二十五日前後，與其情婦郝孚　，（前田糧處辦事員）雙棲溧陽平陵旅社一一一號房間，詎荒淫過份，致將金磚一塊（三十兩）遺落該社，當經該社老板（現任宜溧指揮部政工室參謀）檢獲，繼經王爲民來社相索，時王任該縣主任秘書，故未予深究，即將原物（金塊卅兩）還之，卒以王爲民因案被押，宜溧指揮部即在追究該金磚的來源，衆信這定是句容縣民血汗的結晶無疑。</p>
<p>當石啓民奉省令派周啓文看押王爲民時，王對石說：「　米不是你呌我賣的嗎？」石反駁說：「我是呌你賣倉餘，誰呌你賣賦穀？」王無詞以對。此段插話頗堪玩味。</p>

<h3>軍警監視嚴厲執行限價　各市場仍陷停頓</h3>
<p>昨晨警備部稽查遍全體人員，仍會合市警局經濟科，及各管區分局，繼續出發監視棉紗，棉布，證券，燃料，及南北米市塲，各市塲因在軍警監視下，受限價所遏制，故全部未能做開，各市皆陷於停頓狀況。所呈獨秀者，僅股票市塲，雖在軍警監視下，開市不久，即再吿滿堂紅。食米黑市猖獗異常，本市郊區白粳喊價更高。</p>
<p>又訊：棉紗市塲昨無形停頓，塲外亦未有所聞軍警憲齊集市傷，嚴格監督，並有上週六違章之二經紀人遊街示衆，以致人心惶恐，買賣頓成僵局，咸以討論今後如何交易爲中心，故市場雖照常開放，而交易毫無。</p>
<h3>物價漲勢未戢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國經濟硏究所統計：六月廿八日至本月三日，本市之批發物價指數，已高逹戰前之二百四十五萬三千倍。物價自上月廿五日以後，作空前未有之激漲，至廿八日勢猶　穖，廿九日因半年結算停市，卅日及七月一日因各業結帳需款，同時因生活指數激漲，公私嘰關發薪，需要大量現款，市面銀根抽緊，物價約跌落一成左右。開關後雖當局全力鎭壓市場，但物價漲勢</p>
<p>邇來物價之漲勢，益見猖獗，昨據東方經濟研究所發表，上週（上月二十八日至本月三日）之本市基要日用品零售物價指數如下：</p>
<p>（一）食物類爲一，四五八，〇〇〇倍，較前週上漲百分之三三·一五。</p>
<p>（二）衣着類爲二，一七三，〇〇〇倍，較前週上漲百分之三九·七四。</p>
<p>（三）燃料類爲一，六五三，〇〇〇倍，較前週上漲百分之五一·五一。</p>
<p>（四）雜項類爲四，〇五七，〇〇〇倍，較前週上漲百分之二九·二五。</p>
<p>（五）總指數爲二，一四七，〇〇〇倍，較前週上漲百分之三八·一五。</p>
<p>總計上週之總指數已漲達二百十四萬七千倍，較前週猛漲五十八萬餘倍，其漲勢之烈，爲以往所未有。上週各項物資中，以燃料上漲最多，係爲燃煤來源缺乏之故，其他如食物及衣着之漲勢，亦未稍弱云。</p>
<h3>人心俏利買氣旺盛　華股又告滿堂紅　統債激漲外股仍未作開</h3>
<p>華股昨繼纖滿堂紅，小型股加價五元至十餘元不等。永紗最高曾加到六百元，多方適可而止，廣帮亦賣，最後在加四百餘元下掙扎，暴漲過激，滿目混亂，識者咸具隱憂，反動自在意中。</p>
<p>晨開時人心仍極俏利，永紗開出即漲達限度，各股亦陸續宣吿漲停。永紗在空方急補，新買湧來之下，一五六號七六號等，更進至照加三百元之多，迨代辦費開高爲三七四元及三八〇元，始由六〇號一六二號等脫手，退而迫近限度。新光景福由大批實貨籌碼調濟，低至漲限之下，成交不少，惟一〇七號二三四號等仍納，最後復須貼價二百元左右，餘股仍屬滿堂紅。</p>
<p>後市繼續俏利，永紗曾加到六百元即吿回落，各小型股亦普遍加水五元至十多元不等，臨收時在四百元至四百五之間徘徊，塲外各未上市股票，再升半成至一成不等。</p>
<p>永安紗廠昨開股東大會，議決每股發息（實物）十元。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>昨漲風頗烈，統丙晨開即躍升爲八〇萬，高價達九二萬，而後稍平，退至八四萬左右結束，成交二三百萬。較上週六計甲乙升十四萬元，丙漲十七萬元，丁種昻十三萬元，統戊亦好起十五萬元。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>昨仍無做開。</p>
<h3>銀根趨鬆</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根走勢鬆動，銀錢業票據交換中，四行二局一庫稍有差進，總額二八七六億，計中央銀行差進六六六億，中國銀行則差出三九九〇億，交通銀行差進一〇八五億，農民銀行差進四七五億，中信局差進一九六八億，郵匯局差進一九三四億，中央合作金庫差進七三八億，商業行莊大交換差進一五一億，小交換差出八四三六億，外商銀行差進總額五四〇九億。</p>
<p>又訊：據金融界表示：銀根纖緊原因，（一）北來游資减少，申匯雖已開放，但爲數不多，而現鈔輸滬量激减。（二）物價激漲聲中，多單者均不願拆放。（三）漢口暨其他各地游資來滬數量亦减少。</p>

<h3>茶價挺升</h3>
<p>茶市昨仍一致前進，臨收結果，行情均演滿堂紅。良以毛茶原料，產價旣不斷步砌，同時又因各物均漲，運費亦有調整之訊，喊價卒吿翱翔，至交易則以吐納談判未能順利，致與上週相比，則較形遜色。</p>
<h3>六次臺糖報價核配</h3>

<h3>北煤南運交通　仍無恢復希望</h3>
<p>北煤南運，因交通受阻，目前仍無恢復希望。昨據燃管會負責人談稱：除開潔礦已侮月有大量產品外，其他各產區產量均極微少，但開灤煤暫已無法運輸，燃管會雖有向南洋煤產區訂購燃煤，運華救濟之計劃，但因政府不予外匯，恐難實現。如此下去，本市七月份燃煤供應，勢將有煤荒發生之可能，深盼政府核准購煤之外匯，從事國外採購煤斤云</p>
<p>又燃管會前派中國航空公司之「瑞新輪」，駛基隆裝運燃煤來滬救濟，該輪已自基隆裝台煤八千二百噸，定今晨運滬供應，需求者聞此略感安定云。</p>
<h3>肥皂貨稀步升</h3>
<p>日用品肥皂市面，以門莊去化尙活，且廠家貨派貨稀少，籌碼枯燥不數市需，人心奇挺。固本皂行情步漲九十萬元，箭刀皂亦好一百四十萬元，祥茂光華兩皂走勢甚暢，市氣挺昻，軋升一千萬元。光華每箱漲至二千五百五十萬元，其他火柴火油等亦挺秀</p>
<h3>捲菸銷暢續漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市況，因頤中公司派貨延期，又加廠盤調整，貨主扳意甚堅，而同業　胃亦健，買風又盛，市盤飛升。</p>
<p>十支大英烟漲至五億二千五百萬元，比週末狂漲一千五百萬元。老刀烟亦升一千萬元，其餘各牌條烟亦均挺俏，惟美烟馬力斯六更，及茄力克等聽烟市均回小</p>
<h3>棉紗場外情勢混亂　布疋交易稀少喊價參差</h3>
<p>紗市因經警團派員在塲監視，塲內無正式交易，但塲外情勢紊亂，而鮮喊開，惟聞四十二支藍鳳，喊價較週末微挺一二千萬元棉布市勢陷於停頓狀態，開盤前十分鐘，布業公會理華長董久峯奉警備司令部命，宣佈開價祗跌不准漲，惟合法利潤則予以保障，同時誥戒在場經紀人，計有三點：（一）各經紀人在二日內務必有成交單繳出，否則除名；（二）經紀人均有供給孰爲業外人囤戶情報之義務；（三）午後塲外交易絕對嚴禁，違犯者將較游街更嚴厲之處罰，深盼各經紀人同體政府當局抑平漲風之至意，惠予合作，以待四星期後美援物資到埠，必可達到强抑漲風之目的，故人心震動，未敢開做</p>
<p>迨至十點半後，再經有關方面之剴切勸導，始稍有做開，喇叭童細布以二千二百四十萬，午收軋升二百十萬，陽光細布以二千一百十萬，四君子嘩嘰二千四百八十萬元結束，步秀七十萬元。此外漂布微升，士林布及安安藍布等再昻一百至四五百萬不一。</p>
<p>又訊：龍頭細布場內喊價，聞由二千五百二十萬，退至四百五十萬有成交，四君子嘩嘰亦有少數交易，而場外龍頭則喊二千五百五十萬左右。</p>

<h3>萬豊祥紡織廠　不準遷臺經營</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕髯波萬豐祥紡識廠，前呈紗管會，以電力不足，原料價格較昂，與技工缺乏爲理由，請准許遷台經營。該會當據情轉部，昨已奉到部令駁斥。蓋台灣非產棉區，遷臺經營，原料更貴，同時與經濟部提倡發展內地紡識業政策不符，故對該廠請求，不予照准。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會　維持原生產額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡織業公會前因原棉不繼，有减產二成之　，現悉已打消此意，仍維特原生產額。因一則紗管會已迭次表示供給各廠原棉，美援棉花亦可多量配給；同時减產勢將影響工人之就業問題，實際困難甚大。</p>
<h3>人絲初堅後疲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市高後回低，卒仍比上週六軋升二千萬元之譜。一二〇號金三馬有光，上午最高十三億九千萬元有成交，最小降至十一億七千萬元即期價，午收週一期喊十二億六千萬元。下午開盤喊十三億元，降至十二億八千五百萬及七千五百萬元元有成交，收盤十二億六千萬元有人要，八千萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市高揚，各級五担貨均無做開，C字等級喊價叩近十五億，零担昨有十餘包交易，上午高零担即期款做十三億五千萬元，下午做十四億元有二三天期頭。千經昨日喊價亦見提高。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市受當局監視，正式交易做開甚少。眞絲被面下午行情在六億三千萬元左右，格子璧縐在二百三十萬元關內，華錦縐普通貨喊一百萬元，其餘各貨，交易亦甚寂寥。</p>
<h3>產區價格節節上升　食米門售加價　白粳薄稻二千二百萬元</h3>
<p>米市仍停頓未開，警軍繼續在市塲嚴査，由於產區價格有升無退，貨主因成本關係，故無售戶。塲內開寗壞之江西秈約四百石，價爲一千五百六十萬等三價。門市加價，白粳，薄稻各爲二千二百萬，早稻二千一百五十萬，郊區米價開中等白粳粳薄稻二千萬，白元二千三百萬。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>因小麥價高，內地價漲，故仍不能按限價交易，仍停頓未開。兵船粉門售六百萬，小麥廠盤下午開七百五十萬，計升七十萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>初仍無交易，後由公會公佈六月二十六日之成交價（當局限此價）後，稍見應市式之交易，乍豆配本街價八百五十萬，毛菉豆一千萬，生仁及芝蔴均略有做開。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>仍無無交易，廠商亦無無供應，昨日布塲均辦理存貨登記手續，棧單本當規定限期出貨，故近日各油廠出貨至爲忙碌，豆餅無交易，場外喊價四百九十萬。</p>
<p>倉庫存米限令登記</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據悉：米市塲交易僵持情形，晋京請示之吳市長返滬後，當可解決。本市當局對各倉庫存貨，已限令於今日止向社會局辦理登記手續，昨晨米市場已發出緊急通吿，限各米商所有倉庫存貸，務於昨日下午五時以前登記完竣，以便彙轉社會局呈報。雜糧業公會，則於今午十二時載止存貨登記，逾期不報，將受當局嚴厲處分云。</p>
<h3>舶來油料煉成品　可以自由運銷</h3>
<p>財政部上海區貨物稅局，前以奉稅務署令，着對本市之火油等鑛物油類，開征鑛產稅，嗣經本市油脂商業公會，以本市所有鑛油類，俱屬舶來輸入品，不合繳納鑛產稅之條例，據理力爭。</p>
<p>經稅局奉稅務署，對以國外輸入之柴油提煉而成之火油，潤滑油，錠子油等，准予免征鑛產稅，惟是項汕類進出口時，應否塡具黄色報單一節，茲悉該局奉稅務署令，亦准免辦，以資便利。嗣後關於該項舶來油料之煉成品，自可自由遝銷，不必經稅局査驗與批註報單手續云。</p>
<h3>結匯證明書有效期間　國行通告延長至卅天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結匯證明書之有效期限，原經國行規定爲七天，過期作廢，頃經國行業務局，以一四五號通函致各指定銀行，將結匯證之有效期限，延長至三十天。由簽證之日起算，星期日及例假不予扣除，但如結匯證到期之日恰爲假期，則其有效期可延長一天。至於外埠給匯證明書電逹上海出售，仍按過去之規定辦理，即不論其原有日期尙剩餘若干天，只需在有效期限內抵滬，國行即可發給有效期七天之特種種結匯證明書。</p>
<p>又在一四五號通函未發出前，所發之普通及特種結匯證，若因輸入許可證關係未註銷，或由於其他原因未經註銷者，一律由原簽證之日起算，將其有效期展延至三十日。</p>
<h3>出售國營事業　計算價格有困難</h3>
<p>政府前命令中央銀行，籌組銀團，出售國營事業，央行國庫局已奉令遵行，並邀中交兩行，協助辦理，並將由中國銀行負責中紡出售事，交通銀行辦理招商局出售事，央行處督導地位。據各機構自行以美金估價，約値五億美元以上，銀團成立後，將重加估價，但發售股票，則由以美金爲單位，但美金折合率係按黑市抑按結滙證明書價，則並無決定</p>
<h3>美市場絲銷轉旺</h3>

<h3>我世運足球隊　勝華馬聯軍　二比零：始終控制大局</h3>
<p>〔聯合社新翩坡四日電」中國世運足球隊今日在此作末第二次比賽，以二比零擊敗新加坡華僑與馬來聯隊。客隊勝來甚易，雖僅中兩球，但始終控制大局，對方常取守勢。華馬聯隊戰前爲此間有數勁旅，此次幸賴少數優秀球員，免於大敗。華馬聯隊隊長哈立茲，尤爲出力，但比賽進行時，中國隊完全佔上風，前鋒奔跑迅速，郭英祺與鄒文治尤爲活躍，後方防衛又固若金湯，泰然應付敵隊零星偷渡。開賽後五分鐘時，華馬隊右內衛失守，中國隊郭英祺着地打門，一蹴進網，上半時以一對零佔先。下半時，何應分傳球鄒文治，鄒文治項上開花，又吿獲中，終以二對零獲勝。</p>

<h3>雨後場地濕　汽油燒跑道　紅襪一日兩戰　連勝明星軍聯　今日最後一戰再對軍聯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕菲列賓棒球冠軍紅襪隊，昨日晟午連賽二場，分別以九比一，二比一戰勝明星與軍聯。今日最後一戰，下午三時在跑馬廳二度與軍聯會師，賽後卽專程赴日，再取道關島返菲，結束此</p>
<p>昨晨跑馬廣場地猶未盡乾，因客軍離滬在即而軍聯又堅懇再賽一塲，故不得不將明星之戰提前，美軍臨時傾汽油於跑道上燃燒，蒸發地土內水份，延至十時三刻，勉强開賽。紅襪一仍其摧枯拉朽之鋒錺，頻頗得點，明星僅賴麥克萊仕第六局中擊出全壘打，爭回一分，總結果爲九對一。</p>
<p>下午之戰因軍聯各將，俱係一脈相傳，聯絡默契，而且場地較熱，菲隊則自經晨間一戰，諸將已漸露疲態，威力頓减，苦戰五局，始開紀錄，最後一局，又幾被軍聯追成平手，戰續爲：</p>

<h3>世界網球人才寥落　今年的惠勃爾登大會　男子單打水準低落有才難之嘆　黃金國女兒包辦全部女子比賽</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕網球在今日雖然已經發展到成爲最能吸引觀衆的運動之一種，但是依然使各國網球家氣短的是世界運動會還未把網球列入襲賽項目中。因此，一年一度在倫敦舉行的惠勃爾登賽，便無形中成了非正式的世界錦標，是業餘選手般高的目標，也是職業明星最穩固的踏脚石。</p>
<p>惠勃爾登大賽創始於一八七七年，當時僅設男干單打一項，兩年後，加設男子雙打，又五年有女子賽，直到一九二二年女子雙打與混合雙打相繼設立，才算規模大備。惠勃爾登到今日，已經有六十二届的歷史了——兩次大戰，曾使大賽中輟過九年。</p>
<p>本年度的大賽是戰後第三届，計有卅國選手一百廿八人參加角逐，「麥克」（球童）出身的老將派克膺選爲第一種子選手，充分表現出業餘網壇自克萊茂，配爾斯，貝脫拉輩下海後，已有才難之感。惠勃爾登本年又轉人週期性的低潮中。水準呈一般性的低落。種子選手的全部名單是：（一）派克（美），（二）勃朗維區（澳），（三）墨洛坎（美），（四）湯勃朗（美），（五）特洛勃尼（捷），（六）史德基斯（南非），（七）法根堡（奚），（八）貝蒂（美）。</p>
<p>大賽的第二天，爆出了一例令人難以置信的大冷門，奪標希望僅次於派克之第五種子特洛勃尼竟以二比三敗於無　難名的義大利選手克西里，跟着，派克在第四週中又被瑞典非種子球員貝傑林所淘汰，貝傑林英國莫脫命與戰勝史德基斯之阿司鮑斯物其他五稱子，同逹嚴後八人之階段。複賽中，法根堡與墨洛埃分別以二比一擊退貝，莫，勃朗維區直落三輕取貝蒂，匈牙利之阿司鮑斯則再奮神威，而戰五盤後，重演第四週時之傑作，淘汰又一種子湯勃朗。</p>
<p>半決賽於六月三十日舉行，勃朗維區戰勝阿司鮑斯，未出意外，墨洛埃之於亳無抗力下，以直落三被法根堡擊敗，則爲始料所不及。決賽之役，被公認爲克萊茂下海後難有敵手之第二種子勃朗維區，竟於二度扳成平手後，被法根堡擊敗，世界網球皇冕，遂入范根堡之手。</p>
<p>女子單打，向爲黄金國女兒世界。戰前有迎得八屆后銜的馬迪天人（海倫惠爾絲小姐），有自惠勃爾登而躍入好萊塢之馬白兒小姐，戰後又有蓓芝·奧絲朋·白露·赫德輩的相繼崛起。戰後的惠勃爾登美國英雌們，連半決賽也不容他人染指。</p>
<p>女子單打，美國的幾位種子小姐一帆風順，包辦最後四名。半決賽時，白露以二比〇淘汰杜特夫人，另組第一種子奧絲朋小姐自于歸杜邦後，球藝漸呈退步，竟被臥薪嘗胆之赫德以二比一力報上屆決賽中一箭之仇，與昔年惠爾絲因新婚而失去一九三一年度錦標情形，如出一轍。</p>
<p>白露小姐球藝可與年前　　全球的網后蓓芝媲美，而白露的運氣，却更勝一籌。她在女子單打決賽中以六比三·八比六力克赫德，赢得網后榮銜，在女子雙打中與杜邦夫人合作，重溫前年錦標好夢，混合礎打，又與勃朗維區再接再厲，蟬聯寶座，囊括女子三項冠軍，馬迪夫人蓓芝小姐之後，一人而已。（上）（鄒定鑫）</p>

<h3>再記散原先生</h3>
<p>— 陳詒先</p>
<p>在自由談上讀葉遐翁弔散原先生詩，知先生逝世已十二年，並世尙有人念之者，爰再寫此篇。</p>
<p>余兄蒼虬有北站奠送散原先生靈櫬詩，茲錄於後。</p>
<p>「經年牽夢斜街寺，今日安冥　上山，異路憑棺車此別，危時歸骨抵生還。差强宗武諸郞在，（少陵歿於耒陽，宗武流落，至其孫嗣業始遷葬。）相送山陽幾輩孱，（山陽相送，惟餘故人，庾子山句。）我有千哀餘一涕，松庭何日更追　。</p>
<p>病樹有和作，亦錄於後：</p>
<p>「宣南記謁長椿寺，旅　凝　接屋山，異代終期兩楹奠，間關眞見一棺還。微泉淚盡恩長負，築室心存力已孱，饒向郵亭償野祭，過車瞬息不容攀。」</p>
<p>日前晤彥通，知散原先生已於上月某日安葬杭州之南山黄泥嶺，從此一代詩人，埋骨靑山，但供世人之　弔矣。並知先生文稿已由李拔可陳叔通兄介與中華書局承印，彥和兄弟已與中華代表舒新城簽訂合同，大約一年後可以出版，此爲一可喜之事。彥和兄已返南昌郵匯局，彥通兄返南京，登恪兄返珞珈山武漢大學，兪大維部長亦曾到杭州會葬。</p>
<p>淸末四公子，散原先生與譚嗣同最爲知名。（另二人，一爲吳彥復，一爲丁惠康，丁字叔雅，善鼓琴，四十年前余在北京譯學館讀書時，曾與劉樸生到其厲處聽琴。）今人多震驚先生之詩名，而於先生壯年從事政治改革運動，則知之者少，其故實他日當另爲文述之實則先生憂時愛國之熱情，與其對於政治之見解，詩中亦可見一斑。余最愛讀其戊戍政變後至辛亥革命前十餘年間之詩，蓋方當維新運動失敗，又値其尊翁右銘中丞逝世，（中丞與先生父子而兼同志，因主張變法革職。）憂傷憤慨，一發之於詩，遂成就其平生文學上最優秀之境域。如「除夕被酒奮筆書所感」云：「紀年三十日已除，兒童鵝鴨相喧呼，高燭照筵雜羹餅，被酒突兀增長吁。國家大事識一二，今夕何夕能追慕。西南寇盜累數載，出沒蹂躪驕負隅，東盡黄海北嶺微，蛟鯨搏噬豺虎趨。雌雄彼此迄未決，發祥郡縣頻見屠，羣島萬酋益嬲我，陰陽開闔方齟齬。當今事勢豈不瞭，奈何餘氣同屍居。自頃五載號變法，鹵莽竊剽滋矯誣，中外拱手徇故事，朝暮三四紹衆狙。任蒿作柱亦已矣，僵桃代李胡爲乎！宏綱鉅目那皆省，限權立憲供揶揄。何況疲癃塞鈞軸，囁嚅淟涊別有岡，剜肉補瘡利眉睫，舉國顛倒從嬉娛。公然白日受賄賂，韓愈所憤猶區區，吾屬爲處任公等，神明之胄暛淪胥。極念禹械數萬里，久擲身命襯鞭驅，朋興衆說有由致，欲掃歧異歸夷塗。士民覆幕出至痛，地方自治營前模，事急即無萬一效，終揭此義開羣愚。歲時胸　結壘塊，今我不吐誠非夫。聞者愼勿嗤醉語，點滴淚血霑衣。。</p>
<p>此詩作於民前光緒三十年；置之今日，猶堪作寫眞之用，讀之令人感喟憂憤，不能自已。於此知詩人之所以爲詩人，固有其不朽者存，而拳拳宗國，抱恨九原，又爲千古詩人之同一遭遇己</p>
<h3>珍奇的鼻煙壺</h3>
<p>— 何島</p>
<p>十八世紀時，歐洲人喜歡製作谷種極精緻的鼻烟壶，記得我國的趙　叔還曾寫過一本專門講西洋鼻烟血的小書。那種鼻烟壺大多是純金的，嵌以珠寶，壶蓋打開時，觸動機關，還會發出輕微悅耳的啻樂，壺上雕的人物竟有能活動的。現在還有人收藏着一只鼻烟壺，上雕六個救火員，忙忙碌碌地拿了皮帶向一幢情了火的房子救火，那房子的樓上還有三個人從這個窗口趕到那個窗口，來來往往的想逃出來—每一個人都會動。</p>
<h3>文思</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>幽默小說家喱特好士，當文思阻塞時，便到海水浴塲去，在海水的泡沫中，他獲得了平日不易捉摸的靈感</p>
<p>斯蒂文遜常在睡夢中獲得靈感，寫成許多小說，銷路甚廣，著名的如「化身博士」，便是他在夢中獲得靈感而寫成的。</p>
<p>美國著名劇作家由琴。奧尼爾曾自認他的許多劇本的情節，也是從夢中得來的。</p>
<p>康普登·麥根齊要尋一個孤島寫他的書。幾年前，他曾租了一個小島，後來又換一個，追求着助長文思的孤寂。</p>
<p>蕭伯納在書室裏掃着筆時，侮覺文思不足。他有一次對人說過，他有許多劇本是從坐在公共汽車上層或火車裏獲得的意念所寫成的。一個念頭出現，他立刻用速記符號記下來。</p>
<p>小說家哈代自認穿着鞋子時他一點也寫不出。詩人朗弗羅宣在日出日落時寫作。威爾斯在乘坐汽球時寫了好些偉大作品。</p>
<p>烟草助長文思。詹姆斯巴雷曾說過，一烟斗的烟等於一個念頭，六個念頭成一個情節。</p>
<h3>名人怪癖</h3>
<p>— 晉霖</p>
<p>美國大畫家惠斯勒平生玩世不恭，服飾常與人相反。譬如，跳舞時的晚服是西洋人最講究的，他却不帶領結——而在黑色的大皮鞋上簪上一朶紅花。</p>
<p>達芬奇爲歐洲文藝復興時代最著名的大畫家。他是義大利人，不但義繪　，而且長於體育，有時還研空科學，但他寫字時却從右邊反寫到左邊去。</p>
<h3>平津的三輪車</h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>在上海，這樣的事情很容易讓你遇到或看到：</p>
<p>你在電車站上候車，在夜晚，或者下着雨。電車沒有來，或者很擁擠。你於是試着呌一輛三輪車。「三輪車，××路！」三輪車來了，在這種情況之下，不很近的路現在終要討你二十萬或二十五萬，還是心氣很平似的。</p>
<p>你於是還他一個八折，他沒有把頭回過來，或者回渦頭來白你一眼，於是他跨着車子走了。</p>
<p>有時候三輪車嫌你要去的地方太遠，不理你，走了。有時候，他的車子要向西，而你去的地方是向東，他又是恕不應命的。再有時，　答應他二十萬元從某某路到××橋時，雖然尙未到達你的目的地，可是他認爲旣已到××橋，便不應呌他多走一點，因此停了下來，表示他的勞力在二十萬元的代價下業已到此爲止</p>
<p>車夫們的氣燄是很高的；在上海，我知道那些，祗得常常留心，不要想到某某橋過橋的地方而祗說到橋下。下雨天如果不預備「項　一下貴車資，還是乘車別呌他。</p>
<p>經騐了上海車夫的氣燄，到了平津眞是兩樣。平津的三輪車讓你隨便跳上那一輛去，指一個方向，隨便你去你要去的地方；到下來時你問他：「該多少錢？」他客氣地說：「先生，你看着給吧。」如果你給他的車資已超過他預定的標準二三萬時，他必定再連聲的說：「謝謝，謝謝。」</p>
<p>平津的車夫決不敲你竹槓，平常也比上海約低三分之一，雖然平津的糧食是比上海貴得多。在北方的主食糧林子米（苞米）貴達十二萬一斤時，平津的車夫生活是近於悲壯的。據說他們現在每天收入約有七八十萬，除掉十五萬車租，有時要修理車子，如果一家有三口，買苞米果腹還是很困難的。可是他們規矩，決不胡來。平津的車夫沒有不理你的時候；如果他們要回家了，必定客氣地吿訴招呼車子的人。如果你吿訴他某某路而踏過一二條馬路未曾找到你的目的地時，他也不會塊怨你，嘴裏嘰哩咕嚕，甚至停了下來同你吵。</p>
<p>平津的馬路平整寬闊，街上人少車少，也是使三輪車乘客感覺暢快的一點。北平的前門，故宮附近發條馬路，天津的舊英法租界幾條馬路，平整寬舒，三輪車毫不費勁地飛馳着，同上海中區一小時走半條馬路不可同日而語。</p>
<h3>施耐庵與姓張的</h3>
<p>— 松浦</p>
<p>施耐庵之「水滸傳」，在我國洗傳極廣，足以與我國四書和西洋的聖經洗通數相比擬，套句俗語，就是：「有并水處皆有之。」</p>
<p>於此洋洋七十大回之巨著中，有一很有趣的事情：偽稱姓名時，多說姓「張」。如宋江恐被人逮捕，隱姓潛逃時，人問其姓，必回曰：一小可姓張」；吳用携李逵謙盧俊義上梁山，也對人稱李逵是「張黑子；戴宗帶李逵上山找公孫勝，公孫之老母詢李逵姓甚，戴宗答曰：「此人姓張」；凡此類例子舉不勝舉，總之，諉稱假姓時，在水滸中都說姓「張」。</p>
<p>不知這是一件　然的事，或是故意如此？如說「偶然」爲之，這麼一大部小說中竟會有這許多假姓「張一的人，於理也不通；如說「故意」爲之，那末施耐庵與姓張的定有密切關係：非親人即仇人；否則斷不會如此念念不忘於姓「張」的。</p>

<h3>Gu Zheng gang Inspects Bianyuan; Standards for Emergency Relief to Henan Disaster Determined; Qin Decun Comforts Wounded Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xiangzhou, 4th] Kaifeng Dispatch: Minister Gu Zhenggang and Vice Minister Qin Decun arrived in Bian by special plane at 2:00 PM on the 2nd, accompanied by Chairman Liu of Henan Province. They immediately went to Xiaonanmen, Songmen, Caomen, Longting and other war zones to inspect. That evening, at a symposium held by various sectors at the Provincial Bank, Chairman Liu first reported on the Kaifeng campaign. Subsequently, Gu and Qin delivered speeches, stating that they came to represent the Central Government and extend their deepest condolences to the people of Henan Province, especially Kaifeng, and expressed their greatest respect to Chairman Liu and all the soldiers who defended Kaifeng. Although the relief funds are meager and difficult to compensate for the losses in the war, they have great significance in spirit. Representatives from all sectors in Henan then made statements, unanimously calling on the Central Government to immediately stop conscripting soldiers and grain from Henan Province, and elaborating on the causes and consequences of the Kaifeng campaign, requesting accountability for senior commanders. On the morning of the 3rd, Vice Minister Qin presided over a public memorial service for the late Division Commander Li Zhongnian. Afterwards, Gu inspected the schools most severely affected by the disaster, such as Henan University and Kaifeng Women's Normal School, while Qin went to the hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers and the remaining 400 officers and soldiers of the 66th Division, 13th Brigade. In the afternoon, Gu also attended a meeting of the local relief committee, where the standards for distributing relief were determined. According to Minister Gu's announcement, the central government's emergency relief funds for the Henan disaster include 360 billion to subsidize security teams and 295 billion for relief. In addition to the 50 billion brought by Gu and the 35 billion brought by the Executive Yuan's comfort mission, and the 10 billion remitted to Zhengzhou, the remaining funds are being transported to Bian by the Executive Yuan and will be distributed soon. The distribution standards that were decided are: 10 million for each person who died or was seriously injured due to the disaster, 5 million for minor injuries, 3 million for those who cannot be saved without assistance, and 10 million for each disaster-affected household whose houses were destroyed. This will be handled by the Executive Yuan's comfort mission in conjunction with local authorities. In addition, Vice Minister Qin brought 10 billion yuan on the President's orders specifically to provide pensions for the families of officers and soldiers who were killed or wounded. Furthermore, when the President was in Zhengzhou, he personally instructed the allocation of 50 billion for emergency relief to public educators and 35 billion for emergency relief to students. The procedures for distribution began yesterday, with 10 million for each public educator and 2 million for each student.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 4th] Kaifeng Dispatch: Kaifeng is gradually returning to normalcy.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Committee Resolves to Approve Double Postage Rates</h3>

<h3>Kuomintang Central Political Committee Resolves to Recommend Dong Zhao Concurrently as Chairman of Shaanxi; President Urges Reflection on Past Work</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Kuomintang President Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the Central Political Committee on the 5th. First, Minister of National Defense He Yingqin reported on military affairs, stating that the main battles are underway in eastern Henan and western Shandong. The bandit armies of Chen and Liu have gathered forces of over 200,000 people, and the National Army has also mobilized a comparable number. Fierce fighting is currently underway. The bandit side has suffered losses of over 20,000 people in this campaign. After He's report, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, and others spoke, mostly focusing on the lack of coordination in current party, government, and military work. Finally, the President stood up and gave a speech, believing that the lack of proper coordination between the party, government, and military is a fact, but everyone has a responsibility in the current situation, so a thorough review is necessary. The President's opinion is to emphasize reflection on past work, and the attendees also expressed agreement, but the method, time, and location of this review have not yet been decided. Subsequently, various personnel proposals were passed as follows: (1) Chairman of Shaanxi Zhu Shaozhou will be reassigned, and it is internally decided to appoint Dong Zhao, commander of the 19th Pacification Zone, concurrently. (2) Duanmu Kai is internally appointed as Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan. (3) Lei Fazhang is internally appointed as Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of U.S. Aid Allotment Will Focus on Cotton; Yan Jiagan Comes to Shanghai to Discuss Special Funds for Economic Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, United Press] According to senior officials of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, a large amount of cotton will be included in the new allocation of supplies to China by the Economic Cooperation Administration during the period from July to September. In the first phase from April to July, one-third of the supplies allocated to China were food, so the food quota in the second phase will be smaller. This is due to the availability of harvestable agricultural products. The Economic Cooperation Agreement signed in Nanjing stipulates improvements in the allocation system, so new guarantees will be obtained in this regard. It was also announced that construction materials or major production tools will not be allocated until the Steelman Industrial Survey Group is expected to complete its work on August 1st. Officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration responsible for allocating supplies to China are still reviewing the list of supplies to be allocated in the future new period and have not yet determined the quantities. But it will apparently exceed the $36 million allotment in the first three-month period that has just ended. The Economic Cooperation Administration revealed that it intends to handle all unfulfilled cotton purchase contracts between China and textile companies, totaling $40 million. The Economic Cooperation Administration will directly ship cotton worth $30 million, and the remaining amount will be supplied by the Chinese government. This type of contract for purchasing U.S. cotton had a precedent in the previous period, when the Economic Cooperation Administration handled contracts totaling $15 million. According to experts, during the longest possible delay in allocating major production tools, the Economic Cooperation Administration will approve the allocation of parts to repair China's existing major production tools. These parts will be handled according to the selection principle. The Economic Cooperation Administration is currently fulfilling orders submitted by various Chinese industries themselves, which have been sent through the Chinese government. However, the Economic Cooperation Administration will list these parts as "goods" rather than "major production tools." According to the authorities, other large quantities of goods that the Economic Cooperation Administration will ship in the new period will be fertilizers and rice. Most of the rice will come from Siam, although it was originally hoped that fertilizers could be purchased from Myanmar. Most of the fertilizers will come from the UK and Belgium, and the Economic Cooperation Administration originally hoped to purchase large quantities of fertilizers from these two countries, but the difficulty lies in China's lack of British pound foreign exchange. At the same time, the Economic Cooperation Administration is deeply willing to purchase fertilizers abroad with gold pounds as much as possible to avoid shipping out the American fertilizers that American farmers urgently need. An Economic Cooperation Administration official said: "The supply of fertilizer is really the best way we can use to increase food production. This is very effective for increasing rice production, but this method is not widely used in China, except in Taiwan Province." Other food shipments will include wheat and flour, but it is expected that the volume of these food shipments will be lower than the volume in the first phase.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Yan Jiagan, liaison commissioner of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, went to Shanghai by night train on the 5th. The main task is to discuss with Lapham whether to change the $68 million special economic construction fund from U.S. aid. When the U.S. Congress's aid to China plan stipulated that $60 million would be used for China's economic construction, the total amount of aid to China loans was $463 million. It has now been reduced to $400 million, so whether the $60 million figure has changed still needs to be negotiated by both parties. Yan has received instructions from the government, and it is reported that Lapham will also ask Hoffman for instructions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 5th] The Steelman Survey Group, led by Hansted and accompanied by Jia Beilei, Mao Yisheng, and others, arrived in Hangzhou at around 5:00 PM. After resting briefly, they visited the Qiantang River Bridge. Hansted is the chief engineer of the U.S. Lehman Railroad and is a highly renowned transportation expert in the United States. He praised the bridge project highly. They are scheduled to take a train to Nanchang on the morning of the 6th to inspect the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the major artery of Southeast China.</p>
<h3>Negotiations of Bilateral Agreements</h3>
<p>Report by the Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] After the signing of the Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement, the use of U.S. aid has shifted from the diplomatic stage to the stage of implementation and utilization. On the morning of the 5th, Dong Lin, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, specially convened a meeting of Yan Jiagan, liaison commissioner of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, Secretary-General Shen Xirui, and responsible persons from relevant departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report on the negotiations of the bilateral agreement. Yan Jiagan and Shen Xirui raised several issues that require assistance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and inquired about matters regarding the utilization of U.S. aid. Shen arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 5th and visited President Weng in the afternoon to request instructions on the technical issues of implementing the utilization of U.S. aid. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>

A spokesperson for the party stated yesterday that the 20 elected Legislative Yuan members will go to Nanjing within days to participate in Legislative Yuan meetings. In addition to these 20 members, the Kuomintang may allow five more. The Democratic Socialist Party previously requested that the number of Legislative Yuan members must reach the statutory number (30) for making proposals. It is reported that the Legislative Yuan meeting may amend this regulation to reduce the statutory number for making proposals to solve this problem. According to a spokesperson for the Youth Party, the five elected Legislative Yuan members of our party will attend the Legislative Yuan meeting together with the Legislative Yuan members of the Democratic Socialist Party within days. The Kuomintang will make further concessions of five to ten people to be filled by Youth Party members from Shanghai. After the announcements are made, they will go to Nanjing one after another.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Xu Shanxiang, the former Examination Yuan member recommended by the Democratic Socialist Party, was recently transferred by the party's meeting and replaced by Chen Jiaqing. Chen is a university professor and a woman.</p>

<h3>More Than 100 Legislative Yuan Members Propose Announcing the Facts of Soviet Treaty Violations and Advocate Making Serious Representations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] Legislative Yuan member Pan Chaoying and 135 others recently proposed a "proposal to request the government to announce the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in order to correct international perceptions and clarify right and wrong." The reasons for the proposal first cited the official statements repeatedly made by our government that the Soviet Union has not earnestly implemented the treaty, explaining that the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty has caused our country to suffer considerable losses in the Northeast after the victory in the war against Japan, and that its assistance to the Communist bandits has created the serious situation in the country today. The proposal criticized the diplomatic authorities' "complete silence," saying that in the "anti-aggression" suppression war, our country should no longer remain silent on the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty, infringement of rights, and aiding the Communist bandit rebellion. The proposal lists two measures: "(1) The Legislative Yuan should request the government to announce the various facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. (2) Make serious representations to the Soviet Union, and if it still has no effect, file a complaint with the United Nations."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is confirmed that the "plan to improve Sino-Soviet relations" listed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy plan for this year is still based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, "requiring the resolution of various Sino-Soviet issues."</p>
<h3>Thousands of Students from Northeast China Arrive in Beiping; Destroy the Beiping Municipal Council; Fu Zuoyi Announces that Beiping Has Been Placed Under Martial Law Since Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 5th] Students from Northeast China in Beiping, in opposition to the Beiping Municipal Council's decision to train Northeast Chinese students, gathered over 6,000 people today, destroying the Municipal Council on Fuqian Street, and after 2:00 PM, went to Dongjiaomin Lane to surround the residence of Speaker Xu Huidong. The situation had not been resolved by the time this dispatch was sent. Starting at around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, Northeast Chinese students scattered inside and outside the city set off separately. Wherever they passed at 9:00 AM, they used chalk to write slogans, mostly against military training, against joining the army, demanding food, and demanding education, and they heavily criticized the Municipal Council. By 9:00 AM, two large groups of students from the southwest and northwest cities converged at the south entrance of Nanchang Street, totaling 14 units, approximately over a thousand male and female students. The large group marched mightily towards the Municipal Council to question them. No one from the council dared to come forward. The students rushed in and destroyed the messenger's office, the councilor's lounge, the offices, the staff dormitories, the doors, windows, and miscellaneous items. Subsequently, Bai Shiwei, the acting director of the police bureau, invited Chen Kefu, chairman of the preparatory committee for the Northeastern Provisional University, and Pang Ying, the director of student affairs of Northeastern University, to the scene to mediate. Chen and Pang spoke and advised, but both were ineffective. The students rushed into the Municipal Council again and destroyed the meeting place. At noon, they went to Vice President Li's residence to petition. At 2:30 PM, they crowded into Speaker Xu's residence in Dongjiaomin Lane, clashing with the military and police who were trying to dissuade them. As a result, over 20 soldiers and police were killed or injured, and three petitioners were killed and over ten were injured. They dispersed at around 8:00 PM. Fu Zuoyi has announced that Beiping is under martial law.</p>
<h3>Students from Various Middle Schools in Kunming Forcibly Occupy Yunnan University</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 5th] The Yunnan University authorities telegraphed the provincial government on the 5th, stating that the students from various middle schools who forcibly occupied the university have recently become even more reckless, forcibly moving entirely into the classrooms, offices, and reading rooms of Huize Building (the main part of the school, built to commemorate Tang Jiyao), using the building as a fortress, arbitrarily piling up and destroying all the wooden furniture, and transporting over 6,000 bricks and tiles to the upper floors, breaking them into pieces, seemingly for use in attacks. Over 800 catties of lime have also been transported to the upper floors, packed into small paper bags, seemingly for use as offensive weapons.

<h3>Editorial: The Stumbling Block to a Peace Conference with Japan</h3>
<p>Recently, both the Legislative and Control Yuans have held meetings proposing the convening of a peace conference with Japan, and suggested that our government adopt proactive diplomacy to strive for the convocation of such a conference. Public opinion has also responded with enthusiastic welcome to this constructive proposal, generally believing that only the convening of a peace conference can thoroughly clarify the settlement of the Japan issue. The diplomatic authorities have treated this issue with great caution. On June 4th, Vice Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao issued a statement to the Central News Agency, expressing the attitude of our government. The main points of Yeh's statement are twofold: (1) Listing the process of negotiations for preliminary peace conference meetings, explaining the differences in attitude between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and stating that our country has fulfilled its due responsibilities in various negotiations. This has been the case in the past, and in the future, we should continue to seek the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan based on a consistent stance. (2) Regarding the draft peace treaty with Japan, our government has been constantly preparing and conducting in-depth research since Japan's surrender. If the convocation of the peace conference is in sight, our country's draft peace treaty can be submitted immediately. According to Yeh's statement, our government has not only fulfilled its due responsibilities for the convocation of the peace conference, but also made thorough preparations for the draft peace treaty. Our country bears no responsibility for the preliminary peace conference meetings being stalled and not convened.</p>
<p>A "peace treaty" is a document that restores peaceful relations between warring countries. The conclusion of a peace treaty is the normal way to end international wars, with few exceptions. Therefore, it is said that a peace treaty is the final chapter of a war. After World War II, neither the major peace treaty with Germany nor the major peace treaty with Japan has been concluded; the major peace conferences with Germany and Japan have both been stalled due to disputes over procedural issues. A peace treaty is a document agreed upon and produced by a peace conference. If the convocation of the peace conference is nowhere in sight, the peace treaty cannot be concluded, which is a natural phenomenon. Why can't the peace conference be convened? The facts of the past two years fully illustrate the rise of power politics, with the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union having plunged the entire international political arena into a state of fear and suspicion. In the case of the peace treaty with Germany, the foreign ministers of the four countries have discussed it many times without result, and even regarding the procedural issues of the peace conference, the Soviet Union has refused China the right to participate. The procedures of the peace conference are filled with complex and gloomy phenomena, so there is naturally no discussion of the substantive content of the peace treaty. In the case of the peace conference with Japan, China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have three different views on the procedural issues: the United States and Britain advocate that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission that fought against Japan jointly draft the peace treaty, and that resolutions be passed by a two-thirds majority; the Soviet Union advocates that the foreign ministers of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be responsible for drafting the peace treaty and convening the peace conference, and that the four countries retain the right of veto; our country compromises on the above two views, advocating that the eleven countries participate in the preliminary peace conference meetings, but that the majority of votes passed in the meetings should include China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have vastly different opinions on our country's views, resulting in nearly a year of negotiations failing to be completed smoothly. This is not because our country has not fulfilled its responsibility to mediate, but because it is difficult for the United States and the Soviet Union to reach an agreement, and they have missed the good opportunity to convene the peace conference at an early date.</p>
<p>What the United States and the Soviet Union are fighting over regarding the Japanese peace conference is the veto power issue, which is a procedural issue of the peace conference and has not yet touched on the content of the draft peace treaty. Originally, the peace treaty is the substance, and the peace conference is the form. In theory, the substantive content is more important than the form; however, allied politicians today are willing to argue about the form and neglect the content, which is regrettable! Our government has a definite stance on the form of the peace conference, and has also made full preparations for the content of the peace treaty, and has never been shaken by the dangerous phenomena of the "Cold War" between the United States and the Soviet Union. In general, our country's attitude is relatively firm and has a consistent style. Our country's firm attitude is much more progressive than that of Britain; the shrewd and calculating British Foreign Secretary Bevin has already admitted to the world his mistakes and failures in handling the issue of convening the Japanese peace conference. Last November, in order to break the deadlock in the peace conference, our government submitted a memorandum to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, harmonizing the differing opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, and hoping for a compromise solution to promote the success of the peace conference. Strangely, Britain not only did not adopt our country's compromise plan, but instead cursed it, with complaints arising from all sides. The prestigious London Times even criticized our country in its January 6th editorial for "refusing to adopt the same stance as the Western powers." Even Australian officials attacked our country's compromise plan, which is a pity! Yet, not long after, Australia changed its tune and loudly called for the convening of a peace conference with Japan. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech at the Labour Party's annual conference and his foreign policy report in Parliament also fully revealed the urgency of demanding the convening of a peace conference with Japan, and the Times' editorials were completely different from half a year ago.</p>
<p>The facts listed above illustrate the firmness of our country's attitude and the hesitation of Britain's attitude. The development of the facts over the past six months illustrates the correctness of our country's stance, which has not been shaken by the dangerous signs of the international Cold War. If Britain had supported our country's compromise plan last November, the United States and the Soviet Union would definitely have accepted it without objection, and the preliminary meetings of the peace conference with Japan would not have been stalled until today. Now that the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming more intense, and the United States' policy of supporting Japan is in danger of going astray, Britain, Australia, and other countries are deeply fearful and worried about the future of peace in the Far East. Can this not be said to be Britain's own fault?</p>
<p>In conclusion, our country has suffered deeply from the harm and poison of Japanese aggression for the past fifty years. Regardless of age, location, or profession, everyone has the same feeling and the same reason, demanding the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the fair and thorough settlement of the Japan issue, and the establishment of a grand plan for a hundred years of peace in the Far East. After reading Vice Minister Yeh's statement, we believe that our country's firm stance on the peace conference with Japan is absolutely correct; however, for the sake of national security and peace in the Far East, we still hope that the government authorities will continue to promote the realization of the preliminary meetings of the peace treaty with Japan, and deal with the various issues of the peace treaty with Japan with a proactive spirit, to live up to the expectations of the people of the whole country. At the same time, we also hope that the people of the whole country will unanimously support the government as a backing, to fully support the government's policy towards Japan and cope with this complex and volatile international environment.</p>

<h3>A Tense Scene at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly: Wei Daoming Responds to Interpellations, Defends Public Enterprises and Arson Case</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Taipei, 5th] The 5th general meeting of the Provincial Assembly entered a tense stage today. After Chairman Wei's general report on administration at 8 a.m., the councilors raised interpellations one after another. Liu Kuocai, Li Yousan, Lin Bihui, and Ma Yue criticized the huge expenditures of public enterprises and expressed doubts about personnel management and revenue and expenditure. Chen Maodi and Yang Tianfu pointed out the meager treatment of public teachers and the rectification of corruption and incompetence. Huang Liandeng and Lu Yongkai, due to the tragic New Taipei City Xindian River car burning case, requested the dismissal of Railway Bureau Chief Lang Zhonglai, saying that the bureau's revenue was used for useless consumption instead of road construction, treating human lives as if they were grass. They also mentioned that Lang Zhonglai abused his power when he first took office, using 160 private individuals, of which only 62 were technical personnel, and the rest were administrative personnel, causing the employees to be unable to work with peace of mind. Moreover, the newly appointed personnel spent 100,000 to 200,000 public funds as travel expenses. I don't know whether the bureau's budget has been approved by the provincial government. Lu Yongkai also provided a list on the spot as evidence of abuse of private individuals. Chairman Wei orally answered all the inquiries. He said that the board of directors should be responsible for the revenue and expenditure management of public enterprises, and that the so-called huge expenditures are because there is no subsidy requirement for provincial finance, and it is necessary to restore general preparation, which is the basis for a large increase in production in the future. As for the treatment of public teachers, due to limited financial resources, he hoped to provide evidence for the rectification of corruption, which will be severely dealt with. Next, when discussing the arson case, Wei tried his best to support the Railway Bureau, saying that the cause of the disaster was the passengers carrying gunpowder, and the responsibility did not seem to lie with the Railway Bureau. Punishing the bureau chief is an unfair and unreasonable act, which has a bad impact on administrative efficiency. Moreover, the personnel involved are already under investigation by the court, and the issue of responsibility will not be difficult to find out. As for the issue of Director Lang's abuse of private individuals and abuse of public funds, Wei said that he heard about it for the first time today, but judging from the great progress in road administration, the daily freight volume has increased from 12,000 tons to 17,000 tons, and the revenue has also increased by one-third, which is enough to show that he has not failed in his duties. Replacing personnel and increasing efficiency, then the act of replacing is necessary. Wei said at the end that Director Lang was intimidated before taking office, and the intention is obvious. He hoped that the arson incident would not be confused with Director Lang's personal issues. The conference in the afternoon was a civil affairs report and interpellation.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Water Resources Approved the Allocation of Funds to Dredge the Quanhe River in Anhui: The Budget of Over 100 Billion Will Start Construction Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Water Resources has recently approved the allocation of 45 billion yuan to carry out the dredging project of the Quanhe River in Anhui. The Quanhe River originates from the western border of Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, and flows eastward into Anhui Province, passing through Linquan County and entering the Shuiying River at Sanliwan in Fuyang County, with a total length of about 130 kilometers and a drainage area of about 2,000 square kilometers. Before the Yellow River flooded into the Huai River, the original river channel could still accommodate the floods and would not cause harm, so there was no embankment. Small boats could also pass from Sanliwan to Linquan County. The land in the basin is fertile and the agricultural products are abundant. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the Yellow River flooded into the Ying River and entered the Huai River. The river channel from Sanlihai upstream to near Tangzhuang, about 14 kilometers long, gradually silted up due to backflow and top support. It has been more than eight years, so that the entire river channel is completely blocked and turned into flat ground. Although temporary repairs were made to the downstream embankment during the Yellow River flood, the water from the upstream and the accumulated water in the vicinity were not easy to discharge smoothly, so floods were still unavoidable, and more than 150,000 mu of farmland on both sides were flooded, and the annual losses were difficult to calculate. Now the Yellow River has long returned to its old course, but the tail water of the upstream has lost its tailboard, and the harm is as before. Moreover, the area has been repeatedly harassed by bandits, and the people are in dire straits. In order to relieve the people and increase production, and to facilitate shipping, it is urgently needed to dredge the area with work for relief. It is estimated that the earthwork is about 624.198 cubic meters. Together with the expenses of mechanics, miscellaneous workers, and materials, it will cost more than 137 billion yuan. The Ministry of Water Resources has approved the advance allocation of 45 billion yuan of national currency, instructing the Huaihe River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to consult with the local military and political organs to organize a construction organization, and start construction soon to carry out the dredging. In addition, the benefit of afforestation is closely related to water conservancy. The Ministry of Water Resources has issued a notice to its subordinate agencies to pay special attention to afforestation this year. According to the Huaihe River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, the Huaihe River Basin Restoration Embankment Engineering Bureau reported that the willow planting and embankment protection work of the bureau's various engineering offices this year is summarized as follows: the willows planted in the past have mostly grown alive, a total of 146,210 trees.</p>

<h3>Berlin Deadlock Unbreakable: Three Powers Decide to Send Note to the Soviet Union; Soviet Commander Hints at Taking Action Against Airlift</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th]  The three powers, Britain, America, and France, are facing a diplomatic showdown with the Soviet Union over the Berlin blockade.  The confrontation will take place in Moscow when the Western ambassadors present a demand to the highest Soviet officials for the lifting of the Berlin blockade.  It is anticipated that within a few days, the West, either collectively or individually, will send a similar note to Moscow.  Well-informed sources believe that the Soviet reply will suggest a resumption of the four-power high-level meeting, or a reopening of the four-power foreign ministers' conference. The Soviet side has made such suggestions repeatedly in recent weeks.  Britain and France will undoubtedly agree to this, but the United States will insist on a guarantee of a new basis for negotiations before the meeting is resumed.  [Reuters, London, 5th]  A Foreign Office spokesman has confirmed that British, French, and American representatives have drafted a unanimous, solemn note to the Soviet Union in London, protesting against the Soviet blockade of West Berlin. A dispatch from Washington states that State Department officials revealed that the note has been drafted but has not yet been presented to the Soviet Union. However, it will be delivered to Moscow no later than Wednesday. Before it is delivered, the content of the note will not be made public.  It is also rumored that Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the German Occupation Forces, Sokolovsky, sent a letter to the three-power commanders-in-chief within 24 hours after meeting with them on Saturday, but this has not been confirmed.  The British spokesman stated that General Robertson had not received any formal letter from the Soviet side. [Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky today protested to the British, American, and French commanders-in-chief, stating that the three powers' airlift to Berlin was a violation of German aviation regulations, hinting that it would be restricted. Sokolovsky's letter directly pointed out that the Western allies' air activities were contrary to all agreed-upon agreements governing Berlin's aviation and must be stopped. The reaction of the Allied side to Sokolovsky's move is that the Soviet Union's blockade of West Berlin by land will be extended to the air. Allied sources also said that the only way for the Soviet Union to stop the Allied airlift would be to set up barrage balloons. In such circumstances, the British and Americans would order their air forces to shoot them down. If they did, the Soviet side might retaliate, thus causing the first exchange of fire. The Western allies have been operating the airlift between Berlin and West Germany for five days without interruption. Allied sources also stated that the Western countries would not cancel the airlift system because of Sokolovsky's protest and that the Allies' joint protest letter to the Soviet Union was about to be delivered to Moscow. It is expected that Sokolovsky's protest will be ignored.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Bevin States Firmly: Britain Will Not Yield to the Soviet Union; Plans to Send Giant Airships to Assist in Transporting Grain</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 4th]  Foreign Minister Bevin, in a speech today in Wymondham, Suffolk, stated that if the Soviet Union is willing, Britain is very willing to discuss the Berlin situation.  But he will not allow the starvation of 2.5 million people in Berlin to be used as a tool of Soviet policy, just as he will not allow the blockade to force the British people to submit.  He hopes that everyone can maintain their rationality and determination, so that they can finally achieve their long-term goals and find a final solution to the German problem. Bevin also strongly emphasized that the Western powers are in Berlin based on their rights and will not yield because the Soviet side is using the starvation of Germans as a weapon, thus allowing the Soviet Union to achieve its goals. The amount of air transport to Berlin will increase day by day, making it difficult for the means of using famine as a weapon to succeed. [Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Britain plans to send ten Sunderland-class giant airships to increase the airlift between West Germany and Berlin. Each of these airships can carry four tons of cargo and will travel between the Elbe River's Linnewitt and Berlin's Havel Lake. Today, 96 British aircraft and 181 American aircraft landed in Berlin in six hours.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lauenburg, 4th] According to boatmen who arrived in Lauenburg today, the port of Wimberg on the Elbe River is crowded with ships hoping to transport grain to Berlin. These ships are all being detained by the Soviet side, and sometimes even empty ships are not allowed to depart.</p>
<h3>Collective Farm System Not Applicable to Czechoslovakia; The Principle of "Land to the Tiller" Is Still Implemented</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Czech Capital, 4th] Communist Prime Minister Zapotocky said today that the Soviet collective farm system is not applicable to Czechoslovakia. After the Cominform criticized Yugoslavia for favoring farmers, rumors spread that Czechoslovakia would implement the collective system. In fact, this is not the case. Land to the tiller is our principle. Although the constitution guarantees freedom of belief and religion, every citizen must obey the laws of the state, and the church cannot oppose the state. We only have one people's democratic state. Any Czech who wants to leave the country will be issued an exit passport by the government at any time.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Policy: Internal Discord</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Journalists and observers who are consistently well-informed now believe that the policies of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Cominform leader Zhdanov are in conflict with each other. They recall that although Yugoslavia was condemned by the Cominform, it still participated in the East European and Soviet foreign ministers' meeting held in Warsaw. And Tito seems to believe that he can appeal to some force in the Soviet Union to support his opposition to the Cominform's criticism. The journalist said that a conflict between Molotov and Zhdanov is very possible because the two are potential contenders to succeed Stalin. The Cominform is now gradually pursuing its own independent foreign policy, which is unprofessional and lacks coordination, so it has caused Molotov a great headache, especially when he is fully engaged in dealing with the Berlin crisis.</p>
<h3>America Builds Strategic Highway for Afghanistan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 4th] A dispatch from Peshawar states that the United States will be responsible for overseeing the construction of a strategic highway for Afghanistan. The road passes through the Hamand territory, across the Kabul River, through the Khyber Pass, and to Peshawar, saving hours of travel time compared to the current caravan route. It is reported that the Mohammand chieftain received some cash rewards for the road passing through his territory. In addition, the United States is building roads in other parts of Afghanistan centered on Kandahar.</p>
<h3>Clashes Erupt Between Two Communist Factions in Trieste</h3>
<p>[United Press, Trieste, 4th] The pro-Cominform communists here clashed twice on the 4th with pro-Tito communists and anti-communists, respectively. Police used tear gas to restore order. Two political marches were held in the Slovene village of Trieste Free Territory on the 4th. The pro-Tito communists held a meeting in one place, and the pro-Cominform communists marched into the meeting place, shouting "Cowards" and "Traitors," and the struggle began. Anti-communists held a meeting in another location and also clashed with the pro-Cominform communists.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Lodges Fifth Protest to Albania, Demanding an End to Inhumane Measures</h3>

<h3>Yugoslav Communist Party Expresses Support for Soviet Policy Toward Germany; Condemns the Attitudes of Bulgaria and Albania</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 4th] The Yugoslav Communist Party's official newspaper "Borba" published an editorial today, firmly supporting the Soviet Union's policy in Germany, stating that the Soviet Union's policy in Germany is to uphold peace and the interests of the German people. The Western countries' monetary reform measures in West Germany are promoting imperialist goals and endangering peace. The two-year plan for Germany drafted by the East German Economic Commission will enable Germany to have a correct democratic regime to serve the interests of all people and peace. [Reuters, Belgrade, 5th] The Yugoslav Communist Party newspaper "Borba" said that the Soviet Union will never abandon Yugoslavia and drive it into the embrace of imperialism. Since the Soviet Union has consistently adopted an anti-imperialist stance, Yugoslavia will never be isolated. The newspaper also pointed out that Albania is using barbaric methods to deal with Yugoslavia and interfering in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. The newspaper also pointed out that Bulgaria has adopted an illogical attitude, saying that the Bulgarian representatives who came to Yugoslavia to sign an industrial agreement actually asked Yugoslavia not to host a banquet for them. The intention is to avoid raising their glasses to toast Marshal Tito at the banquet. [Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 4th] The Yugoslav official news agency announced that the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party has invited representatives of all communist parties, whether or not they have joined the Cominform, to participate in the Fifth Communist Party Congress, which will open here on July 21. [Associated Press, London, 5th] The Yugoslav Communist Party today seemed to have prompted the Eastern European countries to confront the policies of Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito. According to the Yugoslav official news agency, the Yugoslav Communist Party is scheduled to convene the Fifth Congress in the capital of the country on the 21st and has invited all communist parties to participate. At the same time, Bulgarian newspapers bluntly demanded that Yugoslavia explain whether it intends to remain in the Eastern European communist camp or cooperate with Western countries.</p>
<h3>US Military Aid to Western Europe: Preliminary Negotiations Begin Today in Washington; Montgomery to Go to Paris to Discuss Reorganization of Allied Forces</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Complicated talks between the United States and military aid to European anti-communist countries will begin here this week, possibly on the 6th. Diplomatic circles said on the 5th that the talks may be limited to general discussions on how the United States will aid the five-nation alliance of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

[United Press, London, 5th] British Imperial Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery will travel to France this week for a four-day official visit to meet with the French Minister of Defense. Since April, considerations of a Western European military alliance have been unfolding in London. This trip is officially related to the Western European alliance. At the same time, Washington is beginning diplomatic negotiations between the United States and the five nations of the Brussels Pact to discuss the relationship between the United States and the alliance. It has been rumored that Montgomery will serve as the Chief of Staff of the planned five-nation alliance. This trip to Paris may be to discuss the reorganization of Western European allied forces and the coordinated action of the armies of various countries.</p>

<h3>The British Government Is Doing Its Best to Suppress the Malayan Communists: Wu Bosheng, Chinese Consul-General in Singapore, Speaks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 5th] Wu Bosheng, the Chinese Consul-General in Singapore, who returned to China to report on the Malayan situation, said here that the British government is now doing its best to suppress terrorist activities in Malaya. The communists in Malaya are still carrying out their consistent policies of sabotage and destruction, causing an "epidemic" of assassinations of Chinese and Europeans to sabotage the British government's economic institutions. The terrorists are originally part of the wartime forest guerrillas. They were armed by the Japanese before the surrender, and their power became stronger. A year ago, they extorted money from the Chinese. Due to the threatening nature of their activities, the police decided to suppress all underground activities. Wu is scheduled to return to his post in Singapore at the end of July. [Associated Press, Singapore, 4th] The Malayan Federal Government today announced measures to protect railways, post offices, oil wells, and other facilities to prevent sabotage. At the same time, the police arrested 20 communist suspects in Kuala Lumpur and Pahang. A British police officer disguised himself as a Soviet officer who parachuted into Malaya and infiltrated the Communist Party, seizing an arsenal.</p>
<h3>Bangkok Has Become a Communist Base in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Establishes a Large-Scale Embassy in Bangkok</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bangkok, 4th] A new base for communist activities in Southeast Asia seems to be forming in Bangkok. The Soviet Union is planning to establish a large-scale embassy in Bangkok with more than 40 staff members. There are only about ten Soviet citizens in all of Thailand, so each citizen has at least four diplomatic representatives. Soviet Ambassador Netchina and his staff are staying in a large hotel in Bangkok and have begun distributing news releases to various newspapers. This situation cannot escape the attention of Western diplomats. Before returning to the United States last week, US Ambassador Stanton told the Associated Press that Moscow is not only playing tricks in Europe and China, but the situation in Malaya has attracted worldwide attention. If all of Southeast Asia becomes a solid anti-Soviet group, it will be of great importance to the world. Before leaving, Stanton visited Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, who told him that Thailand would not be controlled by the Communist Party, but there were undoubtedly many communists among the overseas Chinese. At the beginning of last month, Phibun ordered the arrest of 200 Chinese communist suspects to prevent violence, but rumors of riots have not disappeared.</p>

<p>Former British Army Officer Speaks in Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 4th] A former British army officer who arrived here from Malaya told our agency that the current disturbances in Malaya are undoubtedly due to the instigation of the Communist Party. He believes that there must be a large organization in the Far East, probably in Burma and India, whose sole purpose is to disrupt tranquility. Everything is orchestrated by the Soviet Union. Those who have been trained in Moscow and directed by Moscow are now in charge of radio stations in the forests and have trained former guerrillas and bandits into powerful troops. These signs are worrying.</p>
<h3>Korea Will Be Renamed the "Republic of Korea"</h3>

Bernadotte also revealed that he will request an extension of the truce period. He said, "I feel this move is absolutely necessary. I hope the Arabs can clearly see that if they do not agree to the extension of the truce, they will be seen by the world as indirectly willing to have war in the Holy Land rather than peace. Whichever side fires the first shot on Friday, when the truce expires, will be seen by the world as the main person responsible for the failure of the United Nations' peace efforts."</p>

<h3>Britain Implements Social Insurance System, National Care from Cradle to Grave, No Worries About Birth, Old Age, Sickness, Death, or Unemployment</h3>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] The National Health and Insurance Act and the Town and Country Planning Act have come into effect on the 5th. Britain's post-war social reform has thus opened a new era, and the living standards of countless people have been improved as a result. This world-leading and unparalleled social security system enables all men, women, old, and young in Britain to face the daily dangers and responsibilities of life without fear or worry. They are indeed cared for from cradle to grave. On the one hand, local health authorities are responsible for the welfare of pregnant women and mothers; on the other hand, under the insurance system under the new Insurance Act, there is a funeral grant for the deceased. Everyone has insurance against so-called "income interruption," which refers to accidents, unemployment, and old age. In case of illness, not only the person concerned but also their wife and children receive "allowances." There is no need to worry about medical expenses; the National Medical Service provides all necessary treatments, medicines, or, if necessary, hospitalization and surgery. Finally, after retirement in old age, both husband and wife receive pensions. There are over 20 million insured workers nationwide. The establishment of this insurance institution is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of National Insurance, according to the new Health Act. Complementing the national public health is the planning for housing, which will also be comprehensive in the future. In the past, hasty house building sometimes resulted in slums or damage to natural beauty. According to the Town and Country Planning Act, the Minister of Town and Country Planning, Mr. Silkin, now has full power to prevent such mistakes, ensuring that residences are well-organized and most suitable for aesthetics and hygiene.</p>

In order to prevent merchants from taking the opportunity to move materials after the inspection begins, 5,000 people will be mobilized tomorrow, divided into 1,000 groups, with each group responsible for inspecting one warehouse, striving to complete this work within one or two days. Anyone found to have concealed unreported or exceeded the limit of materials will have the goods confiscated and the owners arrested and strictly dealt with, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Complain to the Social Affairs Bureau, Request Increase in Current Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Because the price limit for rice in this city is too low and rice prices in the producing areas are soaring, merchants have no profit motive, and the market has not officially opened to this day. Yesterday afternoon, representatives from the North and South Rice Markets, Oil Cake, Bran, and Miscellaneous Grain Markets, including Xu Songren, Zhang Chao, Yin Fuxiang, and Xing Zhigang, and more than a dozen others, visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to state that after the price limit, market prices in the producing areas were instead higher, forming a inverted phenomenon, with no normal transactions at all, and off-market transactions were thriving. They requested an increase in the price limit so that legitimate market transactions could return to the right track. Director Wu replied that he would discuss it with the relevant parties before studying an appropriate solution.</p>

<h3>Three Members of National Bank Return to Shanghai, Discuss Four Missions to the North, National Treasury Bonds Sold in Beiping and Tianjin, Dumping Goods Causes General Price Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Xia Jinxiong, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department, and Wang Zhong, Director of the Northeast Region, were dispatched to North China in late June to handle the diversion of idle capital and various economic issues. After staying there for a total of thirteen days, they completed their official duties and returned to Shanghai together on the 4th. When the three met with reporters yesterday, they stated that there were four major tasks in the North: The first was to promote short-term national treasury bonds. After consulting with relevant local agencies, sales in Beiping began on the 26th of last month. The sales agency is the Beiping branch of the Central Bank. There is a lot of idle capital in Tianjin, and there is also a need to sell treasury bonds. After on-site consultations, it was decided to start sales on July 5th. Before leaving Tianjin, they also discussed all technical issues with the persons in charge of the local exchange. The second task was to handle relief work in North China. Commodity prices in Beiping and Tianjin today are much higher than in Shanghai, so people's lives are difficult. After arriving in Beiping and Tianjin, they consulted with local agencies and began dumping materials such as rice, flour, and cotton cloth on the 28th of last month, and personally went to the market to preside over everything. As a result, it was very effective, and commodity prices in North China generally fell.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Issue</p>
<p>Another task was to study the opening of Shanghai exchange rates. After detailed discussions with relevant local people, it was deeply felt that the restrictions on Shanghai exchange rates in the past were very strict, and cash was still being smuggled in. Therefore, whether Shanghai exchange rates should be opened or not is no longer very relevant. The problem is how to divert idle capital in North China so that it has a proper outlet. The exchange of Northeast currency in Beiping and Tianjin was ordered to be stopped on the 28th of last month by the Mobilization Headquarters. However, it is understood that this move respects the will of the local public opinion organs in order to cope with temporary price fluctuations. According to the entry of circulating currency, it is a natural phenomenon under the different commodity price levels inside and outside the customs. At present, since Shanghai exchange rates are rationally opened, it should be able to reduce the pressure of idle capital on Beiping and Tianjin. In the future, a complete plan will be formulated in the near future on the issue of the exchange of circulating currency, under the principle of taking into account the interests of both Northeast and North China.</p>
<p>Food Issue</p>
<p>The urgent matter dealt with on this trip was the food issue in North China. In order to suppress local grain prices, in addition to the government transporting flour for dumping, this trip also agreed in principle with Commander-in-Chief Chuan that the Central Bank would use yarn to exchange for miscellaneous grains from the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan to supply the needs of North China, avoiding the use of cash to purchase locally in North China, which would stimulate grain prices. As for all technical issues in the promotion, the Director Zheng of the North China Region of the Central Bank is responsible for consulting and resolving with the Suppression Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Cleanliness Competition for Entertainment Venues to Be Held in Mid-Month</h3>

Those with excellent results will be rewarded, and those who are unclean will be dealt with for violating police regulations.</p>
<h3>Public Transportation Companies Request Tripling of Prices, New Telephone Prices to Be Announced Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Following the price increases of public utilities, public transportation companies in this city have successively applied to the Public Utilities Bureau for adjustments to fares. The Public Transportation Company's public buses on various lines, French-owned trams and red public buses, British-owned trams, city ferries, etc., are said to be requesting increases of more than 300 percent, and insist on implementing the new prices before the 10th. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau is personally reviewing the reasons presented by each company and will convene a meeting to decide on this matter in the coming days. As for the new telephone prices, the difference between the number of increases requested by the company and the number approved by the Public Utilities Bureau was too large, so they could not be announced at the same time as public utilities such as tap water, gas, and electricity. Director Zhao convened the telephone company authorities separately yesterday morning to negotiate. It is heard that opinions have gradually approached, and Director Zhao has submitted the audit opinions to Mayor Wu for approval, which may be approved and announced today.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Strikes Taiwan, People Panic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th Dispatch] A powerful typhoon is gradually approaching, and it is raining and windy here this morning, and the wind is very strong, and people are afraid. According to the Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Station at 11:00 AM: "At 9:00 AM this morning, the typhoon has reached 22.5 degrees north latitude and 123.5 degrees east longitude, which is about 260 kilometers southeast of Hualien Port, and is advancing towards the north-northwest at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Celebrate US Independence Day</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 4th was the US Independence Day, but since it fell on a Sunday, all the celebration programs were postponed to yesterday. US Consul General Ward also rushed back to Shanghai a few days ago to preside over the celebration ceremony. Mr. Ward attended the annual banquet of the American Chamber of Commerce yesterday at noon and gave a speech, stating: The success of American independence was greatly aided by several European countries. Therefore, in these difficult years after the war, the United States is also actively assisting various countries to achieve the road to freedom and maintain the integrity of the rights and interests of various countries. He condemned the purpose of communism is to destroy the independence of various countries and make the internal affairs of various countries subject to the dictatorial communist regulations. Our purpose in China is to seek a strong, unified, and democratic China, so we give aid to China. All patriotic Chinese and American people should understand this. After the meeting, Mr. Ward went to the American Boy's School at 3:00 PM to preside over the opening ceremony of the American Overseas Chinese Baseball Annual Tournament. Three US warships in the Huangpu River, including the USS Helena, were specially opened yesterday afternoon to receive visits from overseas Americans in Shanghai. From 5:00 PM to 7:30 PM, Mr. Ward also held a cocktail party at his consul general's residence at 1082 Central Lin Sen Road to end yesterday's grand celebration program.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau's Pick-Up and Drop-Off Cars No Longer Pick Up Passengers Along the Way</h3>
<p>In Accordance with the Regulations of the Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>The passenger cars of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau operating in the city refuse to pick up passengers along the way, causing criticism from the outside. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, there are a total of nine passenger cars operating in the city, with three operating routes: one from the North Station to Jing'an Temple, the second from the North Station to South Second Road of Central Justice, and the third from the North Station to the Fishing Market. Because the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau previously stipulated that passenger cars sending passengers from the station to the city are only allowed to let passengers get off the car and are not allowed to get on the car, and passenger cars picking up passengers from the city to the station are only allowed to let passengers get on the car and are not allowed to get off the car. This is to comply with government laws and regulations, but people in the know do not understand the inside story, and it is difficult for us to explain this matter. We are very sorry, he said.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation-US Air Route Changes Course, Tokyo to Be Used as Stopover</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation plans to change the route of the China-US air route to pass through Tokyo. After the company's Tokyo office consulted with the Allied Headquarters, the Allied Headquarters agreed to China National Aviation Corporation to make a "technical landing" in Tokyo, but not to load and unload passengers and cargo. Tomorrow (the 7th), the company's China-US flight will follow the new route with Tokyo as a stopover, without having to pass through Guam. This will shorten the journey by 500 miles and save 200 gallons of gasoline. However, this is only a preliminary test. The formal change of course is subject to diplomatic agreements between the Chinese and American governments. In addition, the company's China-Japan route has nothing to do with the change of course on the China-US line. The former has Tokyo as its terminal and can conduct passenger and cargo business. After the trial flight of the route last month, it has been delayed because there are still several minor issues that have not been resolved.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Reduces Flights, States Three Hardships</h3>
<p>According to China National Aviation Corporation, since the company has reduced the number of flights on some routes, people in various places have felt inconvenienced and have called to request the restoration or increase of flights. Passengers at the Fuzhou station even had a dispute with the ticket seller because of this. However, the company's reasons are: (1) The amount of foreign exchange for oil purchase set by the government is insufficient; (2) The ticket price is too low, and the operating income cannot afford the oil purchase expenses; (3) There is no concrete solution to the exchange settlement problem. It was impossible to make a decision to reduce flights. The restoration can only be considered after the above situation improves. I hope that all sectors of society will understand.</p>

<h3>Jingjiang Guildhall, Tragedy of Collapsed Houses, Donations from All Walks of Life, Treatment of the Injured and Burial of the Dead</h3>

<h3>The Cause of the Tragedy at the Jingjiang Guild Hall</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Jingjiang Guild Hall building on Dapu Road, South Shanghai, suffered a tragic collapse with deaths and injuries due to the strong winds and rain the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, accompanied by Wu Wenhua, the director of the Second District Public Works Management Office, and Chief Wang of the Demolition Section, went to inspect the scene yesterday. It is understood that the building was a one-story house with ten-inch brick walls, built twenty years ago. Due to years of disrepair, some of the wood had rotted, and the brick walls were too long without brick partition walls for support. When a strong wind struck, the tragedy occurred. The remaining buildings are also in a dangerous condition. The bureau is working with the police to advise residents to move out, and will conduct inspections to strengthen the structure to ensure safety.</p>

<h3>Opposing the Abolition of the Fisheries Management Office - Telegram to the Legislative Yuan Requesting Impartial Judgment</h3>
<p>All Technical Personnel Request the Dispatch of Senior Officials for Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Representatives of all technical personnel of the Fisheries Rehabilitation and Material Management Office, in order to oppose the advocacy of the abolition of the Fisheries Management Office by a few fishermen and merchants, urgently telegraphed the Legislative Yuan yesterday, requesting an impartial judgment and dispatching senior officials to Shanghai for a thorough investigation, and held a reception for the press to announce the truth of the office's work. The original telegram presented to the Legislative Yuan is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan and all the Honorable Members: Recently, a few fishermen and merchants, under the guise of joint names, have advocated the abolition of the Fisheries Management Office on the grounds that it monopolizes fishery relief materials, hoping to achieve their selfish desire of obtaining fishing vessels. We are surprised to hear this. The distribution of fishery relief and rehabilitation materials will soon be discussed by representatives from all provinces at a meeting convened by the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee on the 19th of this month, and a public notice has already been published for the allocation of the first batch of fishing vessels. Therefore, the current task of the Fisheries Management Office can only be to execute the intentions of the superiors and has no power to influence them. We, as fishery technical personnel, have been working at the Fisheries Management Office for two years. Over the past two years, we have made contributions to the advancement of modern fishery in our country, such as the application of American trawling, the success of Qingdao seine net experiments, the expansion of new-style fishing in Kaohsiung, the opening of Tokyo Bay fishing grounds, and the active planning and construction of various processing plants. If the attempt of a few speculative elements in the fishery industry is allowed to succeed, it will inevitably lead to the disintegration of this productive undertaking, which is of crude scale, and the loss of the country's foundation will be even greater. As long as we have a breath, we are determined to deal with them. We have always looked up to the heavy responsibility of the honorable members for the country and to help overcome the difficulties of the times. We urge you to make an impartial judgment and quickly send senior officials to Shanghai for a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. Not only can the administrative measures of the Fisheries Management Office be clarified, but also whether the fishery groups that borrow names are aimed at obtaining fishery materials should also be included in the thorough investigation, so as to avoid the cunning and rebellious elements from succeeding in their plans, and the new fishery of our country can truly benefit from it. The country is fortunate. Representatives of all technical personnel of the Fisheries Rehabilitation and Material Management Office, Yu Kun, Chen Shuyi, Jiang Tongsen, Zhuang Jingkui, Yang Rumei (above are representatives of ship captains), Shi Yubin, Chen Mingsheng, Wang Haoxin, Jin Peifa, Liu Yusheng (above are representatives of chief engineers), Chen Xiubai (representative of processing plant), Liu Jinghan (representative of net factory), Chen Kaihui (above are representatives of fishermen) respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Only Government Agencies Can Assume This Important Task</p>
<p>Representatives of the technical personnel hosted reporters at 5 pm yesterday. Captains Wang Xin, Yang Rumei, Net Factory Liu Jinghan, Chief Engineer Jin Peifa, and Chief Captain Yu Kun successively reported on the office's work. They also stated: Although the distribution of materials should be implemented quickly and practically, for the sake of the entire fishery industry, a portion of fishing vessels and all processing equipment must be retained to complete the development of new fisheries and aquatic product processing industries. Only after this is completed as scheduled can the entire fishery industry of our country be expected to revive. The export of fish products can be exchanged for foreign exchange, because the main equipment of fishing vessels still needs to rely on foreign countries. If there is no export of fish products, the Chinese fishery will never be able to achieve prosperity and benefit the country and the people. However, the post-development and experimental work will require the cooperation of considerable financial resources, manpower, and materials to be successful. Therefore, it must be handled by government agencies and cannot be expected by private companies. Therefore, the Fisheries Management Office should still exist, and so on.</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of Western Films, the Situation Worsens: Domestic Film Manufacturers Compete for Territory, Most Cinemas Suffer Terrible Box Office, Inevitably Bowing to Foreign Merchants Again</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The dispute between the cinema industry and Western film merchants, which has been deadlocked for over a week, has not been resolved as of yesterday because the opinions of both parties have been unable to converge. Since the suspension of new film supplies by Western film merchants on the 29th of last month, the city's first-run cinemas have automatically adjusted ticket prices, and the business strategy has been divided into two factions: Daguangming, Meiqi, Dahua, Cathay and other theaters continue to screen old films, while Nanjing, Da Shanghai and other theaters have switched to negotiating with some smaller Western film manufacturers to exchange films. As a result, the former can still be full, while the latter's box office is less than 30%. According to a survey and research report by various cinemas, it is believed that the increase in ticket prices, the decline in general purchasing power, and the different locations of the cinemas are the main reasons for the significant differences in business. However, the audience's choice and love or dislike of the film content is still the basic reason for determining the cinema's business. Therefore, in the distress of not being able to obtain high-quality new Western films, they are quite willing to sign contracts with domestic film manufacturers in order to save the critical situation. However, the city's twelve film production manufacturers are competing for territory, each aiming for cinemas with better equipment, and none are willing to give in, which has caused new undercurrents to rise before the previous waves have subsided. According to various first-run cinemas, there is still a problem: Western film merchants complain that the ticket prices are too low, saying that they do not cover costs, while domestic film merchants complain that the prices are too high, saying that it is difficult to attract audiences. Cinemas have been forced to a dead end. Therefore, if the disputes between domestic film merchants themselves cannot be resolved in the future, they will have to bow to Western film merchants again and request cooperation in order to take care of their own business. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau is convening a meeting of cinemas, Western film merchants, and domestic film merchants to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Continues to Hold Scholarships - Fundraising for Funds Starts Today</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Committee, in view of the recent soaring prices and declining people's livelihood, anticipates that tuition fees in various schools will increase sharply in the next semester, and the situation of impoverished students dropping out of school will become more serious. A meeting was convened the other day, and it was unanimously passed to continue to run this year's autumn semester scholarships to help outstanding young people who are out of school. It was decided to raise scholarship funds from today until the end of September, with a target of 10 billion yuan. It is hoped that readers from all walks of life will contribute their efforts and money, and work together to raise funds. For all weddings, funerals, and celebrations, we can save money to help students; industrial and commercial groups, share the hardships of the times, save on entertainment expenses, and fill the scholarship fund; the meaning is profound, and nothing is better than this. In order to maintain the value of the currency and provide generous interest, the committee plans to purchase short-term treasury bills with the scholarship donations received, and announce them at any time to show its great credibility.</p>

<h3>The Owner of the Sanyi Tea Plantation in Taiwan Province Embezzles Large Sums of Money - Abandons His Post and Flees to Hong Kong, Comes to Shanghai and Is Arrested - Escorted Awaiting Transfer by the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The owner of the Sanyi Tea Plantation affiliated to the Tea Branch of the Taiwan Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Co., Ltd. is Shen Da, a Cantonese man, 28 years old. After taking office in September last year, he appointed his wife, Shen Zhang Yun, as the commissioner and cashier of the tea plantation. At the beginning of his tenure, the tea plantation began to plant citronella tea, with a budget of about NT$4.5 million. This amount was soon received by the tea plantation from the company and planned to be lent to general tea farmers. However, at that time, the tea farmers did not need the funds, so the funds were kept by the tea plantation. Unexpectedly, Shen Da failed in his partnership in business with friends, resulting in huge losses, and secretly misappropriated the funds to make up for the losses. As a result, the company authorities discovered it at the end of the year. Shen Da, upon hearing the news, feared being arrested for the incident, and abandoned his post and fled to Hong Kong in January this year, not daring to show his face. His wife left Taiwan in November and came to Shanghai. After the incident, the company immediately sent Tao Shiyong, the director of the General Affairs Section, to Shanghai to negotiate with Shen Da's father, Shen Zhaoxiong. However, Shen's father, who works for the Nanyang Enterprise Company, had a meager income and was unable to repay this huge sum of money, resulting in repeated delays and no resolution by May of this year. At that time, Shen Da felt extremely depressed in Hong Kong, so he sneaked back to Shanghai and lived at No. 23, Lane 328, Haining Road, Hongkou. The Taiwan Provincial Police Department learned of this from the company's report and telegraphed the Municipal Police Bureau to request his arrest. The Police Bureau arrested Shen at the address on May 26. After being transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, he was interrogated in court on the 5th of last month. Shen confessed to misappropriating public funds. Just as the office was planning to file a public prosecution, it suddenly received a letter from the Taiwan Provincial District Prosecutor's Office, stating that the case had been accepted and requesting that Shen be transferred to Taiwan. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office has now put the case on hold. Although it has been urged repeatedly, no one from the Taiwan Provincial District Prosecutor's Office has been sent to Shanghai to escort him.</p>
<h3>Raids on Brothels and Hotels - Four Drug Cases Solved</h3>

<h3>Prelude to the Battle of Eastern Hebei: The Grain-Grabbing Frenzy</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>[Aviation dispatch from Qinhuangdao to this newspaper, 1st] By mid-June, the wheat ears had turned yellow across the fields of Eastern Hebei. The farmers' sweat and toil had produced the fruits of survival, and it was time for the harvest. However, at this moment, the unfortunate "grain-grabbing war" erupted, which also served as a prelude to the entire war in Eastern Hebei.</p>
<p>Initially, the local Communist forces massively collected scissors, carrying baskets, mules, and large carts, and organized large grain-grabbing teams of men and women. Under the cover of local armed forces, they entered the wheat fields and cut off the wheat ears along the rows. Acre after acre was quickly cleared. Basket after basket of wheat ears was quickly carried and pulled back to the Communist-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Such large-scale plundering and disturbance rendered the farmers' half-year of hard work futile. The issue of food supply arose. The National Army and local militia also had plans to protect the wheat harvest, but ultimately these plans were not implemented effectively. Furthermore, the Communists exploited the weakness of the National Army and local militia being forced into point-to-line defense, allowing the Communists to plunder at their leisure. No wonder the farmers suffered greatly and the local losses were immense.</p>
<p>Eating Small Strongholds</p>
<p>Before the wave of grain-grabbing rose, Lin Biao's Eighth Column, Eleventh Column, and Nie Rongzhen's Fourth Column, Second Column Fourth Brigade, and other units, attacking Chengde, hurriedly sneaked into the Great Wall. Led by units under Nie Neng, they attacked Tangshan and Guye, industrial and mining bases in North China, but did not gain any advantage. Secondly, they decided on a plan to attack small and large strongholds along the Eastern Hebei railway line.</p>
<p>The Communists' plan was to first capture small strongholds on the Eastern Hebei railway line, then take larger strongholds, in order to be able to maneuver freely. To the west, they set up a command post at Hujia Huangling, north of Shimen; to the east, they set up a command post at Daxia Shengang, fifteen kilometers west of Qinhuangdao, and separately attacked the east and west areas of Changli.</p>
<p>East of the Luan River, the Tenth Brigade of Nie's Fourth Column was to attack Shimen, the Eleventh Brigade to attack Anshan, and the Twelfth Brigade to attack Houfengtai. The Fourth Brigade of the Second Column served as a mobile force. Lin's Eighth Column, attached with an independent artillery regiment and a cavalry battalion, was to capture Changli. The remaining local armed forces, such as the Second and Third Regiments of the Twelfth Military Sub-district, the Ninth Regiment of the Thirteenth Military Sub-district, and the county battalions, were to cooperate in the operations.</p>
<p>Lin's Eleventh Column stayed east of Changli, attacking Liushouying in Beidaihe and supporting the Communists attacking Changli, and then planning to take Qinhuangdao. Once the Communist deployment was complete, they began to move south from Lulong and Funing. On the morning of the 23rd, they had reached larger strongholds north of the railway. At night, they approached the railway, and the attack began after midnight, on the 24th. After five or six hours of battle, the Communists in the west captured Houfengtai, Anshan, and Shimen stations west of Changli. In the center, there was fierce fighting in Changli. In the east, they captured Chenjiazhuang, a small station near Changli. Liushouying and Beidaihe were firmly defended by the Twelfth Traffic Police Regiment, and remained unshaken.</p>
<p>The battle of Changli began in the surrounding areas. The traffic police defending the city fought the Communists for a day. On the afternoon of the 24th, they were forced to withdraw from the suburbs and hilltop fortresses, and defended the city and the station. The county security militia fought a hard battle with the Communists at Hongqiao in the southern suburbs. Later, they were unable to hold out and planned to retreat into the city. At this time, the traffic police defending the city had blocked the city gates, so the security militia changed course and went to Luan County.</p>
<p>The traffic police defending the city were the Fifth and Eighth Regiments, mostly equipped with new "Thompson" submachine guns. A lot of money had also been spent on the fortifications in Changli, which were built to look impressive. The only thing lacking for the defending troops was heavy weaponry. The Communist Eighth Column attacked the city all night, with dense artillery fire. Before dawn on the 25th, the north gate was first breached, and then Communists also infiltrated the east and west gates. Most of the traffic police withdrew to the south gate, preparing to retreat. According to the civilians who escaped, "Tang Yisheng, the commander of the traffic police detachment, said to the two regimental commanders: Changli must be defended. Watch me, Tang, commit suicide before you retreat." Unfortunately, the situation was hopeless, and most of the traffic police broke through the south gate. At 11 a.m. on the 25th, the Communists gained control of the entire city wall. Changli was again occupied by the Communists on May 18th of last year.</p>
<p>Around Changli</p>
<p>East of Changli, although the strength of the National Army was weak, the battle lasted the longest. It can be said that the National Army was quite successful in this area. The reason for the success was not only the strong defense of the defending troops, but also the rapid arrival of reinforcements. Fan Hanjie's command in Qinhuangdao certainly had a great relationship.</p>
<p>The battle started like this: Before June 23, the Jin-Yu Railway outside the pass was first cut off. Although the military authorities constantly received reports of thousands of Communists being discovered here and thousands of Communists being discovered there, they did not consider it very accurate, and only made preparations to pay attention.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, the security militia captured several Communists. From the Communists' confessions, the authorities knew that something unusual was happening. They immediately ordered all localities to strengthen their vigilance. At night, the Communists approached the railway. At 2:00 a.m. on the 24th, when the moon and stars were sparse, gunfire and artillery sounded around Qinhuangdao. Later, mixed with the dense gunfire, there were also explosions. Thus, from the Luan River in the west to Qinhuangdao in the east, a line of about two hundred li was under attack.</p>
<p>The morning of the 24th was the most intense period of the battle in the east. The battle was fiercest at Nandasi, a small station nine kilometers west of Qinhuangdao. The navy also fired continuously. At this time, Qinhuangdao was shrouded in artillery fire. In order to keep the Communists away, the authorities set up a command post at Nandasi, personally commanded by He Shili, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region. There were repeated advances and retreats at first, but later they gained a slight advantage. At night, He even rode a small railway armored car to the front to supervise the battle. On the morning of the 25th, reinforcements arrived from Huludao, and the morale was even higher. However, the Communists stubbornly resisted at "Muzhai" and "Caigezhuang" north of the railway between Beidaihe and Nandasi. After another two days of fierce fighting on the 25th and 26th, the Communists were driven back. Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao were able to be connected together.</p>
<p>On the 27th and 28th, the National Army advanced further, driving the Communists north of the railway between Beidaihe and Liushouying. The Communists wavered and began to retreat north. Because the National Army adopted a pincer attack tactic, the Eighth Army and other units advancing east from Guye recovered Shimen on the 27th, captured Anshan on the 28th, and entered Houfeng Temple on the 29th, immediately followed by the recovery of Changli County, which had been occupied by the Communists for five days. It was originally planned that the National Army from the east and west would meet in Changli on the 28th. However, because the resistance in the east was too great, the eastern route only captured Chenjiazhuang Station at noon on the 29th, and was able to meet with the two routes of the National Army in the afternoon. The battle of Eastern Hebei was considered to have come to an end.</p>
<p>The Beining Railway from Jin-Yu section, east of the Luan River, was severely damaged. Fortunately, the "Luan River Bridge," which everyone was concerned about, was heavily guarded and only hit by a few Communist shells, so the damage was small and quickly repaired. Some of the other bridges had temporary pontoon bridges, while others had sleepers laid. The general facilities were easily repaired. It was estimated that it could be rushed through around July 3rd or 4th. Regarding the losses of railway personnel, it is now known that Deputy Stationmaster Wang of Chenjiazhuang Station and others died in their posts. Some were also released after being captured.</p>
<p>Changli suffered the greatest losses in this battle. The Communists looted a lot of supplies and obtained many weapons. Even more grain was plundered in the area west of Changli and east of the Luan River. According to aerial reconnaissance, the Communists used hundreds of carts to transport supplies north, and the quantity was considerable. However, the Communists suffered many casualties in Changli and in the areas east and west of Changli. The Communists did not care about the casualties as long as they obtained the supplies.</p>
<h3>A Romantic Marriage in Wumen: Aged Groom with White Braid Hanging Low; Old Virgin Learning to Be a Bride</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Suzhou to this newspaper, 4th] Cao Yuanbi, a local of Suzhou, is 86 years old and the younger brother of Cao Cangzhou, a Qing Dynasty imperial physician. He passed the imperial examinations in his youth and was awarded the title of Hanlin by the Guangxu Emperor in the 34th year of his reign. He has devoted himself to the study of classics and history and is blind. His wives, Tang and Wang, have both passed away. Recently, due to a lack of care, he asked a matchmaker to find him another wife. On the 4th, the wedding ceremony was held at his residence in Suzhou. The bride, surnamed Chai, is a 56-year-old virgin. The aged groom had his white braid hanging low, while the bride had her hair cut short to her neck. They bowed awkwardly, and their panting could be heard faintly. The spectators thronged the doors, and the news spread throughout the city.</p>
<h3>A Record of Artifacts Unearthed in Changsha</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xuan Yi</p>
<p>[Aviation dispatch from Changsha to this newspaper, 1st] The city of Changsha, Hunan, except for a small area on the north bank of the Xiang River, is surrounded by undulating plains of yellow earth. Initially, when the earth mounds outside the south gate were excavated to level the ground for the construction of the new urban area, a large Han Dynasty tomb in the style of a house was discovered, with three doors that could be entered and exited without obstruction, showing its great height. Later, kiln workers in the suburbs accidentally discovered a medium-sized Han tomb while digging earth to make bricks. The workers thought there were treasures to be unearthed in the soil and dug up the entire tomb, turning it over and over. They also dug up hard pieces of wood.</p>
<p>Tomb Emits Smoke</p>
<p>These pieces of wood were more than ten feet long and weighed about a thousand pounds, making them impossible to transport. They had to turn them over one by one. Underneath the large pieces of wood were wooden planks. When the wooden planks were first lifted, there was a hissing sound, followed by a loud bang and the entire tomb filled with smoke. As a result, two people were injured, and an antique dealer named Qi was imprisoned. The relics in the tomb were scattered everywhere. This type of tomb with large wooden outer coffins is what is known as a Chu tomb from the Zhou Dynasty. At that time, because it was during the Anti-Japanese War, few outsiders knew about it. Only Mr. Ke Qiang, a discerning American, collected a large number of precious and peculiar materials and transported them to Yale University in the United States for exhibition. Due to the unusual nature of the objects, the exhibition was extended for three weeks. Later, Mr. Shang Xiyong stayed in Changsha for a year and also collected a lot. Other than that, no one systematically collected them.</p>
<p>Digging Wells to Steal Treasure</p>
<p>The above two discoveries of ancient tombs can only be considered a beginning. In the six or seven years since then, because artifacts were unearthed in Changsha, the antique shops and stalls along Dongzhan Road suddenly flourished, increasing from one or two to more than fifty. Kiln workers and laborers took this as their profession. Investing merchants used their positions for personal gain and colluded with the laborers, hiring treasure-hunting masters from Henan. Thus began large-scale looting. The treasure-hunting masters from Henan could use an iron rod to strike the ground several feet down, and tell whether there were treasures or ancient tombs underground based on the color of the soil. The treasure-hunting laborers, based on this principle, dug a small well less than one meter in diameter. From the well, they tunneled into ancient tombs five or six fathoms underground to search for more than ten loads of strange antiques.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Tombs Dug Up</p>
<p>A conservative estimate would be that at least a hundred tombs have been dug up, and at least ten thousand artifacts have been unearthed. If you don't believe me, just visit twenty antique stalls on Dongzhan Road in Changsha and you will get an idea. Whether these artifacts are worth a lot of money is another question, but the honesty and lovability of the Hunan people, who do not bring fake antiques to the market, is a fact.</p>
<p>Digging wells to steal treasure is the method used by the villagers. Mr. Ke, the American, used scientific excavation methods to remove the mud and level the ground, excavating the entire tomb architecture and furnishings. Local powerful figures also imitated this method, frankly excavating the entire tomb. However, Ke's excavation had records and photographs, while the excavation by the laborers at the time was only observed and understood at the time, without any records to verify. Because of the above two methods of excavation, everyone knows that there are tombs in the soil, and tombs under tombs. The most common are three layers, from which we know that the three layers of tombs belong to three eras. The bottom layer of the tomb was buried in sediment, and then the top layer of the tomb was buried on top. According to the conversations of kiln workers and laborers, and from the observation of relics, the ancient foundation groups of Changsha, from the Warring States period to the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, are numerous. Unfortunately, the shapes of the discovered objects were not recorded by anyone. Not long ago, you could still see many antiques in Changsha City, truly of all colors and varieties. However, the patterns on the bronze mirrors and lacquerware are unique. Therefore, I decided to collect some of the unwanted leftover broken antiques and spent some time tracing out the restored shapes and patterns, and wrote the research records into two thick volumes of specialized books.</p>
<p>Tomb Structure</p>
<p>The structure of these tombs can be roughly divided into two types: The first type is a wooden outer coffin made of large square wooden strips stacked heavily on top of each other. The cut ends of the large wood are wrapped in silver or tin foil, with the intention of sealing it like tar today. The outer coffin is piled with waste ash like a mountain, completely sealing the wooden outer coffin. The second type is an earthen outer coffin with mud-built walls. From these two forms, it is impossible to determine which form belongs to which era. However, the wooden outer coffin of the first type, because it is sealed tightly, can preserve strange ancient objects such as woodenware, lacquerware, and textiles.</p>
<p>Digging Up Remnants</p>
<p>The common people initially discovered them accidentally, and then there was planned looting. Those with power and influence could dig them up in large quantities. It is said that there is an ancient tomb of a certain imperial concubine west of the city, a Han tomb recorded in the literature. This Han tomb has been attempted by many people, but it has not been dug up yet. The government has also prohibited looting and confiscated hundreds of antiques. However, after a period of time, these locals not only dig new large tombs, but also re-enter the ancient tombs that have been dug up but not completely emptied, once, twice, or three times through tunneling, to extract the remnants. This method of looting is to first open a well-shaped hole, with people standing on both sides of the well. When digging deep, one person stands every two feet, digging up the soil at the bottom and passing it to the second and third people, until they enter the tomb. The most valuable thing for the grave robbers is goldware, followed by bronzeware, so ancient broken clothes, broken armor, broken shoes, etc., are all ruined by them. Among these relics can be divided into wood, lacquer, textiles, bronze, iron, stone, glass, amber, agate, lacquer, realgar, jade, porcelain, pottery, gold, and silver. Due to space limitations, the situation of the unearthed artifacts will be described later. Ancient Mirror Excavated in Changsha (Photo by Jiang Xuanyi)</p>

<h3>Former Chief Secretary of Jurong County Government, Wang Weimin, Indulges in Debauchery and Loses a Gold Brick</h3>
<p>[Report from Jurong to this newspaper, 4th] Wang Weimin, another major criminal in the Shi Qimin embezzlement case (former chief secretary during Shi's tenure), stayed with his mistress Hao Fumin (former clerk of the Grain Bureau) in Room 111 of the Pingling Hotel in Liyang around May 25th. It is said that he indulged in debauchery to such an extent that he lost a gold brick (30 taels) in the hotel. The hotel owner (now a staff officer in the Political Work Office of the Yili Command) found it. Later, Wang Weimin came to the hotel to ask for it back. At that time, Wang was the chief secretary of the county, so the owner did not investigate deeply and returned the original item (gold brick of 30 taels). In the end, Wang Weimin was arrested because of the case, and the Yili Command is now investigating the source of the gold brick. It is generally believed that this must be the crystallization of the people's blood and sweat in Jurong County.</p>
<p>When Shi Qimin was ordered by the provincial government to send Zhou Qiwen to guard Wang Weimin, Wang said to Shi, "Wasn't it you who told me to sell the rice?" Shi retorted, "I told you to sell the surplus grain, who told you to sell the tax grain?" Wang had no words to answer. This interlude is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>News in Brief</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A prison riot suddenly occurred at 3 p.m. on the 4th in the Zhenjiang Prison of Jiangsu Province.

<h3>Military and Police Monitor and Enforce Price Controls Strictly, All Markets Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the inspection department of the Garrison Command, together with the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau and the precinct police stations, continued to monitor the cotton yarn, cotton cloth, securities, fuel, and north-south rice markets. Because the markets were restrained by price controls under the supervision of the military and police, all of them failed to open, and all markets were stagnant. The only standout was the stock market, which, even under the supervision of the military and police, reported another full house of gains shortly after opening. The black market for rice is rampant, and the price of white japonica rice in the suburbs of the city is even higher.</p>
<p>Also: The cotton yarn market was virtually stagnant yesterday. There were no reports of military police gathering to inspect and supervise the market, and two brokers who violated the regulations last Saturday were paraded through the streets, causing panic and making transactions stagnant. The focus was on discussing how to trade in the future, so although the market was open as usual, there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices Not Checked</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to statistics from the China Economic Research Institute, the wholesale price index in this city from June 28 to July 3 has reached 2,453,000 times that before the war.

On the 30th and July 1st, various industries needed funds for settlement. At the same time, the living cost index rose sharply, and public and private agencies issued salaries, requiring a large amount of cash. The money market tightened, and prices fell by about 10%. After the market reopened, although the authorities tried their best to suppress the market, the rising trend of prices</p>
<p>The rising trend of prices has become even more rampant recently. According to the Eastern Economic Research Institute, the retail price index of essential daily necessities in this city last week (June 28 to July 3) is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Food category was 1,458,000 times, an increase of 33.15% from the previous week.</p>

<p>(5) The general index was 2,147,000 times, an increase of 38.15% from the previous week.</p>
<p>In total, the general index for last week has risen to 2,147,000 times, an increase of more than 580,000 times from the previous week. The intensity of the rise is unprecedented. Among the various materials last week, fuel increased the most, due to the lack of coal sources. The rising trend of other items such as food and clothing was not weak either.</p>

Under the urgent covering of short positions and the influx of new buyers, Nos. 156 and 76 went even further, adding more than 300 yuan. When the agency fee opened high to 374 yuan and 380 yuan, Nos. 60 and 162 and others began to sell, retreating close to the limit. Xinguang Jingfu was adjusted by a large number of spot chips, falling below the limit, and many transactions were made. However, Nos. 107 and 234 and others still gained, and finally had to post a price of about 200 yuan. The remaining stocks were still a full house of gains.</p>

<p>Also: According to the financial community, the reasons for the tight money market are: (1) The amount of speculative capital from the north has decreased. Although the Shanghai foreign exchange has been opened, the amount is not large, and the amount of cash transported to Shanghai has been drastically reduced. (2) Amidst the sharp rise in prices, those with long positions are unwilling to lend. (3) The amount of speculative capital from Hankou and other places coming to Shanghai has also decreased.</p>
<h3>Ninth Meeting of the Discount and Lending Committee, Approved Nine Loan Cases</h3>
<p>The National Bank Discount and Lending Committee held its ninth meeting at 11 a.m. on the 5th, presided over by Governor Yu Hongjun, to discuss 11 national policy and business loans. As a result, six national policy loans and three business loans were approved.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The tea market continued to advance uniformly yesterday. As a result of the closing, the market generally reported a full house of gains. Because the price of raw tea leaves continues to rise steadily, and because all materials are rising and there are reports of adjustments in freight rates, the asking price finally soared. As for transactions, the trade negotiations were not smooth, so compared with last week, they were relatively inferior.</p>
<h3>Sixth Taiwan Sugar Quotation and Allocation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of Taiwan Sugar Company will still handle the sixth quotation and allocation of a batch of Taiwan sugar today according to the quotation and allocation method. The sugar is a special grade of granulated white sugar in 200-jin packages. All customers who have been approved for registration can apply for purchase at the office from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. today.</p>
<h3>There is Still No Hope for the Restoration of North Coal South Transportation</h3>
<p>Due to traffic obstruction, there is currently no hope for the restoration of north coal south transportation. According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee yesterday, except for Kaijie Mine, which has a large number of products every month, the output of other producing areas is extremely small. However, it is temporarily impossible to transport Kailuan coal. Although the Fuel Management Committee has a plan to order coal from the South Pacific coal producing areas and transport it to China for relief, it is difficult to realize because the government does not provide foreign exchange. If this continues, the supply of coal in this city in July is likely to experience a coal shortage. It is deeply hoped that the government will approve the foreign exchange for purchasing coal and engage in overseas procurement of coal.</p>
<p>Also, the Fuel Management Committee previously sent the "Ruixin" ship of China Airlines to Keelung to load coal and transport it to Shanghai for relief. The ship has loaded 8,200 tons of Taiwan coal in Keelung and is scheduled to transport it to Shanghai this morning for supply. Those who need it feel slightly reassured upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>Soap Shortage Increases Prices</h3>
<p>In the daily necessities soap market, the going is still active in the direct sales shops, and the supply from factories is scarce. The inventory is insufficient to meet the market demand, and investor confidence is high. The price of Guben soap rose to 900,000 yuan, Arrowhead soap also rose to a good 1.4 million yuan, and Xiangmao and Guanghua soaps are selling very well. The market is bullish and the price is up, surging to 10 million yuan. The price of Guanghua has risen to 25.5 million yuan per box, and other items such as matches and kerosene are also strong.</p>
<h3>Continuously Rising Cigarette Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw prices soar due to delayed deliveries from the Yizhong Company and factory price adjustments. Sellers were firm in their intentions, and buyers were eager, leading to a surge in market prices.</p>
<p>Ten-cigarette packs of "Great Britain" brand cigarettes rose to 525 million yuan, a staggering increase of 15 million yuan compared to the weekend. "Old Knife" brand cigarettes also rose by 10 million yuan, and other brands of strip cigarettes were also brisk. However, the market for "Morris Six" and "Chilly Crack" and other canned cigarettes experienced a slight downturn.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Situation Outside Cotton Yarn Market, Sparse Cloth Trading, Inconsistent Prices</h3>
<p>Due to the presence of police monitoring the yarn market, there were no formal transactions inside. However, the situation outside was chaotic, and few prices were quoted. It was reported that 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was quoted slightly higher than the weekend, by 10 to 20 million yuan. The cotton cloth market was stagnant. Ten minutes before the market opened, Dong Jiufeng, Director of the Cloth Industry Association, announced under the order of the Garrison Headquarters that prices could only fall and not rise, but legitimate profits would be protected. He also warned brokers present with three points: (1) All brokers must submit transaction records within two days, otherwise they will be removed from the register; (2) Brokers have an obligation to provide information on who is hoarding, especially those outside the industry; (3) Outside market transactions in the afternoon are strictly prohibited, and violators will face punishments more severe than public shaming. He hoped that all brokers would cooperate with the government's intention to suppress rising prices, awaiting the arrival of US aid materials in four weeks, which would certainly achieve the goal of strongly suppressing rising prices, causing widespread shock and a reluctance to trade.</p>
<p>It wasn't until after 10:30 AM, after earnest persuasion from relevant parties, that trading began to pick up slightly. "Trumpet Boy" fine cloth traded at 224 million, closing at 210 million higher at noon. "Sunshine" fine cloth traded at 211 million, and "Four Gentlemen" serge closed at 248 million yuan, "Bu Xiu" at 70 million yuan. In addition, bleached cloth rose slightly, and "Shilin" cloth and "An An" blue cloth rose again, varying from 1 million to 4.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Another report stated that "Dragon Head" fine cloth was quoted at 252 million yuan inside the market, retreating to 45 million yuan in actual transactions. There were also a few transactions of "Four Gentlemen" serge, while "Dragon Head" outside the market was quoted at around 255 million yuan.</p>
<p>China Textile Corporation (中紡) Sells Over 900 Yarn Bundles</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation (中紡) sold 904 yarn bundles, totaling 61.69 billion. The approved prices were: 6-count "Secondary Sunlight" at 31.2 million, 8-count "Sunlight" at 42 million, 10-count "Wen Li Ma" at 48 million, 10-count "Secondary Blue Phoenix" at 48 million, 16-count "Red Flower Bee" at 56 million, 20-count "Wealthy" at 61.6 million, 20-count "Flying Horse" at 62.5 million, 32-count "Yang Crane" at 73 million, 40-count "Immortal Peach" at 81.5 million, 42-count "Wen" double-strand "Precious Light" at 85.5 million, and 60-count double-strand "Chestnut" at 155 million.</p>
<h3>Wanfengxiang Textile Factory Not Allowed to Relocate to Taiwan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Ranbo Wanfengxiang Textile Factory previously submitted to the Yarn Management Committee a request to relocate its operations to Taiwan, citing insufficient electricity, high raw material prices, and a shortage of technicians. The committee duly reported the situation to the Ministry, which has now issued an order rejecting the request. Since Taiwan is not a cotton-producing region, operating there would make raw materials even more expensive, and it would be inconsistent with the Ministry of Economic Affairs' policy of promoting the development of the inland textile industry. Therefore, the factory's request was not approved.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Maintains Original Production Quota</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association previously considered reducing production by 20% due to a shortage of raw cotton. It is now understood that this intention has been abandoned, and the original production quota will be maintained. This is because the Yarn Management Committee has repeatedly stated that it will supply raw cotton to the factories, and a large quantity of US aid cotton will also be allocated. At the same time, reducing production would affect the employment of workers, posing significant practical difficulties.</p>
<h3>Rayon Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market started high but then fell, ultimately closing about 20 million yuan higher than last Saturday. 120-count "Golden Three Horses" bright rayon traded at a high of 1.39 billion yuan in the morning, with the lowest spot price falling to 1.17 billion yuan. The noon close for Monday delivery was quoted at 1.26 billion yuan. The afternoon opened at 1.3 billion yuan, falling to 1.285 billion and 1.275 billion yuan in actual transactions, closing with buyers willing to pay 1.26 billion yuan and sellers asking 1.28 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Direct Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was buoyant, but there were no transactions for five-dan lots of any grade. "C" grade was quoted near 1.5 billion yuan. There were more than ten bundles of smaller lots traded yesterday. Morning spot prices for smaller lots reached 1.35 billion yuan, with two- to three-day term prices reaching 1.4 billion yuan in the afternoon. Quotes for "Thousand Classics" yarn also saw an increase yesterday.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was under government surveillance, and formal transactions were scarce. The afternoon price of real silk quilt covers was around 630 million yuan, checkered crepe was within the 2.3 million yuan range, ordinary "Hua Jin" crepe was quoted at 1 million yuan, and trading for other fabrics was also very quiet.</p>
<h3>Prices in Production Areas Rising Steadily, Rice Retail Prices Increase, White Japonica and Thin Indica Rice at 22 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market remained suspended. Police and military continued to strictly inspect the markets. Due to rising prices in production areas and no price reductions, sellers had no intention to sell due to cost considerations. About 400 piculs of Jiangxi Indica rice that had spoiled in storage were sold in the market at prices such as 15.6 million. Retail prices increased, with white Japonica and thin Indica rice at 22 million yuan, early Indica rice at 21.5 million yuan. Rice prices in the suburbs opened with medium-grade white Japonica and thin Indica at 20 million yuan, and white Yuan rice at 23 million yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Because of high wheat prices and rising inland prices, it was still impossible to trade at the restricted price, and the market remained suspended. "Battleship" brand flour was sold at 6 million yuan retail, and wheat factory prices opened at 7.5 million yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Initially, there were no transactions, but after the association announced the transaction price of June 26 (the price restricted by the authorities), a few token transactions began to appear. "Zha" beans were allocated at 8.5 million yuan, "Mao Lu" mung beans at 10 million yuan, and raw peanuts and sesame seeds also saw slightly more activity.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>There were still no transactions, and manufacturers were not supplying. Yesterday, all the cloth markets completed the registration of their inventory. Since the storage slips required goods to be delivered within a specified period, oil factories have been very busy with deliveries recently. There were no transactions for soybean cake, and the asking price outside the market was 4.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>Order Requiring Registration of Rice Stocks in Warehouses</p>
<p>[Another report] It is understood that the stalemate in the rice market is expected to be resolved after Mayor Wu returns to Shanghai from Nanjing for instructions. The municipal authorities have ordered all warehouses to register their stocks with the Social Affairs Bureau by today. Yesterday morning, the rice market issued an urgent notice, requiring all rice merchants to complete the registration of all warehouse stocks before 5 PM yesterday, so that they could be compiled and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau. The Grain Association is also required to register inventory by 12 noon today, and failure to report by the deadline will result in severe punishment by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Imported Oils and Refined Products Can Be Freely Transported and Sold</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance previously levied mineral production tax on kerosene and other mineral oils in this city, in accordance with an order from the Tax Administration. Subsequently, the city's Oil Commercial Association argued that all mineral oils in this city were imported and did not meet the requirements of the mineral production tax regulations.</p>
<p>After the Tax Bureau reported to the Tax Administration, it was approved that kerosene, lubricating oil, spindle oil, and other oils refined from imported diesel oil were exempt from mineral production tax. The Bureau was also instructed that filling out yellow customs declarations at the time of import and export of these oils was also waived, to facilitate trade. Subsequently, refined products from these imported oils can be freely transported and sold without having to go through the Tax Bureau's inspection and endorsement procedures for customs declarations.</p>
<h3>The Validity Period of Exchange Settlement Certificates Extended to 30 Days by National Bank Notice</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The validity period of exchange settlement certificates was originally stipulated by the National Bank as seven days, after which they would be invalid. Recently, the Business Bureau of the National Bank issued Circular No. 145 to all designated banks, extending the validity period of exchange settlement certificates to thirty days, calculated from the date of issuance, excluding Sundays and holidays. However, if the expiration date of the exchange settlement certificate falls on a holiday, its validity period can be extended by one day. As for the exchange settlement certificates issued in other cities and telegraphed to Shanghai for sale, they will continue to be handled according to the previous regulations, that is, regardless of how many days remain on their original validity period, as long as they arrive in Shanghai within the validity period, the National Bank can issue a special exchange settlement certificate valid for seven days.</p>
<p>In addition, ordinary and special exchange settlement certificates issued before Circular No. 145 was issued, if they have not been canceled due to import licenses or for other reasons, will have their validity period extended to thirty days, calculated from the original date of issuance.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Calculating the Price for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises</h3>
<p>The government previously ordered the Central Bank to form a banking syndicate to sell state-owned enterprises. The Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank has been ordered to comply and has invited the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to assist in the process. The Bank of China will be responsible for the sale of the China Textile Corporation (中紡), the Bank of Communications will handle the sale of the China Merchants Group (招商局), and the Central Bank will be in a supervisory position. Each institution has valued the enterprises in US dollars, estimating a total value of over 500 million US dollars. After the banking syndicate is established, it will re-evaluate the enterprises. However, the shares will be issued in US dollars, but there has been no decision on whether the US dollar exchange rate will be based on the black market rate or the exchange settlement certificate rate.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales in the US Market Picking Up</h3>
<p>According to related sources, actual sales of raw silk in the US market have recently shown signs of improvement, because the weaving industries are all using raw silk for weaving. However, prices remain stable and have not exceeded the original set price. As for the export of silk fabrics, conditions in India, Southeast Asia, and other regions have also gradually improved recently. Last year's shipment of 100,000 bolts of fabric to India did not meet the needs of the region, so although there were frequent transactions, actual sales were not smooth.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Transports and Sells Over Two Million Bags of Flour in Tianjin</h3>
<p>In order to suppress prices in North China, the financial authorities have rushed to transport 2.45 million bags of flour to Tianjin, where they will continue to sell large quantities of flour. This flour was purchased by the National Bank previously, and it is now being transported to Tianjin by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Wuxi dispatch, 5th] Credit has eased, and prices are jumping. Due to strict supervision in the market, rice and paddy transactions have been suspended.

<p>Guangzhou</p>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 5th] After rice prices in Guangzhou jumped from 10 million yuan to 18 million yuan per dan, a rice-grabbing incident occurred in Guangzhou Bay yesterday morning for three hours, resulting in the theft of seven dan of white rice.</p>
<p>Chengdu</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch, 5th] Grain prices in Chengdu continued to rise. Double-dan was at 32 million yuan on the 5th. Prices of various goods fluctuated. The municipal government's police brigade searched the speculative market and arrested many people. The commercial sector was in a state of panic, and more than 20 large companies collapsed at the end of June.</p>

<h3>National Finances are Difficult, No Increase in National Universities Allowed, Daxia's Request to Become Nationalized Not Approved, Education Minister Zhu's Reply Explains the Reasons</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Daxia University students requested to become nationalized. The university has reported the matter to the board of trustees, and Chairman Sun Ke has sent a letter to Education Minister Zhu. It has been learned that Minister Zhu has replied to Chairman Sun Ke, stating that there are many practical difficulties in the request to become nationalized. The letter stated: "I received your letter of the 25th of this month. Regarding your request to convert the private Daxia University into a national university, I respectfully submit the following: (1) Due to the difficult national finances, the Ministry has been instructed by the Executive Yuan not to increase the number of national universities. Even if we were to submit a request to the Executive Yuan at this time, it would certainly not be approved. (2) Private schools have their own characteristics and should be supported to allow them to develop freely. (3) There are many private schools. If one school is allowed to be converted into a national university, then all schools will follow suit, as was the case with the subsequent request by Guanghua University. (4) The public funding system has been abolished. Students' financial difficulties cannot be solved by converting to a national university. The above are all practical difficulties. I hope you will understand."</p>
<h3>Rectifying School Discipline, Stabilizing Studies, Daxia University Expels 56 Students</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The private Daxia University in this city announced yesterday the expulsion of 56 students, including Ding Shilan. The announcement stated: "In late June, a group of students fabricated rumors, using the pretext of requesting to become nationalized to instigate student unrest, coerce teachers, tear down notices, resist examinations, obstruct the payment of fees, and even destroy school property and forcibly seize cash. Such actions have completely undermined school discipline. The school treats students like children and has repeatedly given earnest advice, hoping they would realize their mistakes, but they have coerced the masses and intensified their actions, going against the tide and acting arbitrarily. The majority of good students have been deeply intimidated and unable to participate in examinations to complete their studies this semester, which is particularly distressing. In order to rectify school discipline and stabilize students' studies, the 19th University Affairs Meeting resolved to expel all students who seriously disrupted school order."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Allocate More Funds to Eliminate Illiteracy Nationwide</h3>

<h3>Our World Games Soccer Team Defeats Overseas Chinese-Malay Allied Team Two to Zero: Maintained Control Throughout</h3>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 4th] The Chinese World Games soccer team played its second-to-last match here today, defeating the Singapore Overseas Chinese and Malay Allied Team two to zero. The visiting team won easily. Although they only scored two goals, they maintained control throughout, and the opponent often adopted a defensive posture. Before the match, the Overseas Chinese-Malay Allied Team was considered one of the strongest teams here. This time, they were fortunate to have a few excellent players, avoiding a major defeat. Halidz, the captain of the Overseas Chinese-Malay Allied Team, made a great effort, but the Chinese team was completely dominant during the game. The forwards ran quickly, and Guo Yingqi and Zou Wenzhi were particularly active. The defense was also solid, responding calmly to the enemy team's sporadic breakaways. Five minutes after the start of the game, the Overseas Chinese-Malay team's right inside forward lost possession, and Guo Yingqi of the Chinese team scored with a ground shot, giving them a 1-0 lead in the first half. In the second half, He Yingfen passed the ball to Zou Wenzhi, and Zou Wenzhi scored with a header, making the final score 2-0.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 4th] Our country's World Games soccer team competed this afternoon with the local Overseas Chinese and Malay Allied Team and won with a score of 2-0. The audience felt that our World Games team's performance today was worse than ever before.

<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 5th] Our country's soccer team attending the World Games will play another match with the local team here before heading to India.</p>
<h3>Field Wet After Rain, Gasoline Burned on the Runway, Red Socks Played Two Games in One Day, Won Against All-Star Allied Army, Last Game Today Against Allied Army Again</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Philippine baseball champion Red Socks team played two consecutive games yesterday, defeating the All-Stars and Allied Army with scores of 9-1 and 2-1 respectively. Today's final game will be a rematch against the Allied Army at the Racecourse at 3 PM. After the game, they will travel to Japan and then return to the Philippines via Guam, ending this [tour].</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the ground at the Racecourse Plaza had not completely dried. Because the visiting team was leaving Shanghai soon and the Allied Army was insistent on playing another game, the game against the All-Stars had to be moved forward. The US military temporarily poured gasoline on the runway to burn and evaporate the water in the soil. The game reluctantly started at 10:45 AM. The Red Socks continued their overwhelming performance, scoring frequently. The All-Stars only managed to score one point thanks to McLish's home run in the sixth inning. The final score was 9-1.</p>
<p>The afternoon game was because the players of the Allied Army were all related and had a tacit understanding. Moreover, the field was hotter. The Philippine team, having already played a game in the morning, was gradually showing signs of fatigue, and their power was greatly reduced. They struggled for five innings to open the scoring. In the last inning, the Allied Army almost tied the game. The game score was:</p>
<p>Inning | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Total</p>

<h3>Nationwide Tennis Association Actively Being Organized</h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, the supervisor of the Ministry of Education and also the secretary-general of the Chinese National Sports Association, after returning to Shanghai from his inspection in Nanyang, had informal contacts with the tennis community in this city to organize a nationwide tennis organization. Due to the enthusiastic support of the tennis community in this city, concrete measures have been beautifully devised. Subsequently, Mr. Hao returned to Beijing, on one hand reporting to the Ministry about his trip to the South Seas, and on the other hand officially taking over the post of secretary-general of the National Sports Association. He will come to Shanghai again today to further discuss the national tennis administrative organization. Because Mr. Hao has scheduled this Thursday to go to Taiwan to address the issue of the location for the next National Games, it is possible that a decisive plan for the national tennis administrative organization will be agreed upon tomorrow (Wednesday).</p>

<h3>Scarcity of World-Class Tennis Talent: This Year's Wimbledon Championships See a Decline in Men's Singles Quality, Lamenting the Difficulty in Finding Talent; Daughters of the Golden State Dominate All Women's Events</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Although tennis has developed into one of the most attractive sports for spectators today, what still disheartens tennis enthusiasts in various countries is that the World Games have not yet included tennis as a competition event. Therefore, the annual Wimbledon Championships held in London have become a de facto unofficial world championship, serving as a high goal for amateur players and a solid stepping stone for professional stars.</p>
<p>The Wimbledon Championships began in 1877, initially with only men's singles. Two years later, men's doubles were added, and five years after that, women's events were included. It was not until 1922, when women's doubles and mixed doubles were established, that the event reached its full scale. Wimbledon has now had 62 editions—with the championships being suspended for nine years due to the two World Wars.</p>
<p>This year's championships are the third after the war, with 128 players from 30 countries competing. Veteran Parker, who came from "McEnroe" (ball boy) background, was selected as the first seed, fully demonstrating the sense of a talent drought in the amateur tennis world after the likes of Kramer, Pails, and Betra went professional. Wimbledon this year has once again entered a periodic low tide, with the overall level showing a decline. The full list of seeded players is: (1) Parker (USA), (2) Bromwich (Australia), (3) Mulloy (USA), (4) Tom Brown (USA), (5) Drobny (Czech Republic), (6) Sturgess (South Africa), (7) Fancutt (Chile), (8) Patty (USA).</p>
<p>On the second day of the championships, a shocking upset occurred. Drobny, the fifth seed with high hopes of winning the title, was defeated 2-3 by the unknown Italian player Cexiri. Following that, Parker was eliminated by the unseeded Swedish player Bergelin in the fourth round. Bergelin, along with Asbóth, who defeated Sturgess, and the other five seeds, reached the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals, Fancutt and Mulloy defeated Bergelin and Mulloy respectively with scores of 2-1, Bromwich easily defeated Patty in straight sets, and Asbóth of Hungary once again displayed his prowess, repeating his feat from the fourth round after five sets, eliminating another seed, Tom Brown.</p>
<p>The semi-finals were held on June 30th. Bromwich's victory over Asbóth was not unexpected, but Mulloy's defeat by Fancutt in straight sets without any resistance was unforeseen. In the final, Bromwich, the second seed who was considered to have few rivals after Kramer went professional, was defeated by Fancutt after twice leveling the score. Thus, the crown of world tennis fell into the hands of Fancutt.</p>
<p>Women's singles has always been the world of daughters of the Golden State. Before the war, there was Helen Wills Moody, who won eight titles, and Mabel, who leapt from Wimbledon to Hollywood. After the war, there were Pauline Betz, Osborne duPont, and Gussie Moran who successively rose to prominence. After the war, the American heroines of Wimbledon did not allow others to even touch the semi-finals.</p>
<p>In women's singles, the American seeded players sailed smoothly, monopolizing the final four spots. In the semi-finals, Betz eliminated Mrs. duPont with a score of 2-0. As for Miss Osborne, the top seed, her skills have gradually declined since her marriage to Mr. duPont. Gussie Moran, after years of hard work, finally avenged her defeat in the previous year's final with a score of 2-1. This situation is reminiscent of Helen Wills losing the 1931 title due to her honeymoon.</p>
<p>Miss Betz's skills can be compared to those of the world's top female tennis player of many years ago, but Betz's luck is even better. In the women's singles final, she defeated Gussie Moran 6-3, 8-6, winning the title of tennis queen. In women's doubles, she partnered with Mrs. duPont to relive the dream of winning the championship the year before. In mixed doubles, she partnered with Bromwich to continue their efforts, retaining the crown and sweeping the three women's championships, a feat only achieved by Helen Wills Moody before.

<h3>Remembering Mr. San Yuan Again</h3>
<p>— Chen Yixian</p>
<p>Reading Ye Xiaweng's poem mourning Mr. San Yuan in Free Talk, I learned that Mr. San Yuan passed away twelve years ago, and there are still people in the world who remember him. Therefore, I am writing this article again.</p>
<p>My elder brother Cangqiu has a poem for sending off Mr. San Yuan's coffin at the North Railway Station, which is recorded below.</p>
<p>"After years of dreaming of the Xie Street Temple, today he rests peacefully on the Mountain. Parting with a coffin on a different path, returning bones in perilous times is like returning to life. Fortunately, there are still sons like Zongwu, (Du Fu died in Leiyang, Zongwu drifted away, and it was not until his grandson Suye that he moved the burial.) How many weak generations are there to send him off in Shanyang, (In Shanyang, only old friends remain, a line from Yu Zishan.) I have a thousand sorrows and one tear left, when will I ever be able to pay my respects again in the pine courtyard?"</p>
<p>The sick tree has a response, also recorded below:</p>
<p>"Remembering the visit to Changchun Temple in Xuan South, the journey is long and heavy, the mountains connecting the house. Across generations, there is finally a memorial service in the ancestral hall, and in the interval, one can truly see a coffin returning. The tears of the slight spring are exhausted, and the debt of grace is long borne. The heart is set on building a house, but the strength is already weak. If you are willing to repay the wild sacrifice at the post pavilion, there is no time to climb over the carriage."</p>
<p>I met Yantong a few days ago and learned that Mr. San Yuan was buried on a certain day last month at Huangni Ridge in Nanshan, Hangzhou. From then on, a generation of poets will be buried in the green mountains, only for people to mourn. It is also known that Mr. San Yuan's manuscripts have been introduced by Li Bake and Chen Shutong to the Zhonghua Book Company for printing. Yanhe and his brothers have signed a contract with Shu Xincheng, a representative of Zhonghua, and it is expected to be published in about a year. This is a happy event. Brother Yanhe has returned to the Nanchang Postal Remittance Bureau, Brother Yantong has returned to Nanjing, and Brother Dengge has returned to Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain. Minister Yu Dawei also went to Hangzhou for the burial.</p>
<p>Among the Four Young Masters of the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. San Yuan and Tan Sitong are the most well-known. (The other two are Wu Yanfu and Ding Huikang, whose style name is Shuya, who is good at playing the qin. Forty years ago, when I was studying at the Translation School in Beijing, I once went to his residence with Liu Pusheng to listen to the qin.) Today, many people are shocked by Mr. San Yuan's fame as a poet, but few know that he was engaged in political reform movements in his prime. The facts will be described in another article in the future. In fact, Mr. Yuan's enthusiasm for worrying about the times and loving the country, and his views on politics, can also be seen in his poems. I love to read his poems from the decade or so after the Wuxu Reform to before the Xinhai Revolution, because at that time the reform movement had failed, and his respected father, the Right Minister Youming, had passed away (the minister and Mr. Yuan were father and son and also comrades, and were dismissed from their posts for advocating reforms). Grief and indignation were expressed in his poems, thus achieving the most excellent realm in his literary life. For example, "Writing My Feelings After Being Drunk on New Year's Eve" says: "The thirtieth day of the year has passed, and children and ducks are noisy. The high candle illuminates the mat with mixed dishes and cakes, and I am drunk and abruptly give a long sigh. I know one or two things about national affairs, what evening is tonight to be able to reminisce? The bandits in the southwest have been around for several years, emerging and ravaging arrogantly. The east reaches the Yellow Sea and the northern ridge is slight, the dragons and whales fight and the jackals and tigers rush. The outcome has not yet been decided between the two sides, and the counties where they originated are frequently slaughtered. The islanders and barbarians increasingly harass us, and yin and yang open and close in discord. How can the current situation not be understood? Why do the remaining breaths live together like corpses? Since five years ago, it has been called the reform, but it has been hasty and plundered with fraud. Both inside and outside are holding on to the old stories, and morning and evening three or four Shao Zhongju. Letting artemisia be used as a pillar is already enough, why use a stiff peach tree instead of a plum tree! Why are the main principles and important items all omitted? Limiting power and establishing a constitution are for ridicule. What's more, the tired and disabled block the pivot, and the stuttering and whispering have other hills. Cutting flesh to mend sores is beneficial to the eyebrows and eyelashes, and the whole country is turned upside down from amusement. Bribery is openly accepted in broad daylight, and what Han Yu was angry about is still trivial. If we were to be treated like Ren Ang, the descendants of the gods would be completely destroyed. I deeply think of Yu's shackles for tens of thousands of miles, and I have thrown my life to line the whip drive for a long time. The rise of many theories has a reason, and I want to sweep away the differences and return to the Yi Tu. The scholars and people cover their faces and come out with great pain, and local autonomy is the model in front. If there is no effect in an emergency, this meaning will eventually be revealed to open the minds of the masses. Throughout the year, the chest is filled with lumps, and if I don't spit it out today, I am not a man. Listeners, don't laugh at my drunken words, the droplets of tears and blood stain my clothes."</p>
<p>This poem was written in the thirtieth year of Guangxu, before the Republic of China. Placed today, it can still be used as a photo. Reading it makes people feel sad and indignant, unable to control themselves. From this, we know that the reason why poets are poets is that there is something immortal in them, and the fact that they are concerned about the country and hold grudges in the Nine Springs is the same encounter for all poets throughout the ages.</p>
<h3>Precious Snuff Bottles</h3>
<p>— He Dao</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, Europeans liked to make snuff bottles with extremely exquisite grains. I remember that Zhao Shuru also wrote a small book specializing in Western snuff bottles. Most of those snuff bottles were pure gold, inlaid with jewels. When the lid was opened, the mechanism would be triggered, and a slight, pleasant music would be emitted. The characters carved on the bottles could even move. There is still someone collecting a snuff bottle with six firefighters carved on it, busily taking leather straps to put out a fire in a house. Three people in the upper floor of the house were rushing from window to window, trying to escape—everyone could move.</p>
<h3>Literary Inspiration</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The humorous novelist Lytton Strachey, when his literary inspiration was blocked, would go to the beach. In the sea foam, he obtained the inspiration that he could not easily grasp on weekdays.</p>
<p>Stevenson often gained inspiration in his dreams and wrote many novels, which sold very well. The famous "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" was written from the inspiration he gained in a dream.</p>
<p>The famous American playwright Eugene O'Neill once admitted that the plots of many of his plays also came from dreams.</p>
<p>Compton Mackenzie wanted to find a deserted island to write his book. A few years ago, he rented a small island, and then changed another one, pursuing the solitude that promoted literary inspiration.</p>
<p>When George Bernard Shaw was sweeping his pen in his study, he felt that his literary inspiration was insufficient. He once said to someone that he had written many plays from ideas he had while sitting on the upper level of a bus or in a train. When an idea appeared, he immediately wrote it down in shorthand.</p>
<p>The novelist Hardy admitted that he could not write anything while wearing shoes. The poet Longfellow declared that he wrote at sunrise and sunset. H.G. Wells wrote many great works while riding in a balloon.</p>
<p>Tobacco promotes literary inspiration. James Barrie once said that a pipe of tobacco equals an idea, and six ideas make a plot.</p>
<h3>Eccentricities of Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Jin Lin</p>
<p>The great American painter Whistler was cynical throughout his life, and his clothing was often the opposite of what others wore. For example, the evening dress for dancing is the most particular for Westerners, but he did not wear a bow tie—instead, he wore a red flower on his black leather shoes.</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci was the most famous painter of the European Renaissance. He was Italian and not only good at painting, but also good at sports, and sometimes he also studied science, but when he wrote, he wrote from right to left.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws in Tianjin and Beijing</h3>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>In Shanghai, you can easily encounter or see such things:</p>
<p>You are waiting for a tram at a tram stop, at night, or in the rain. The tram has not come, or it is very crowded. So you try to call a rickshaw. "Rickshaw, ×× Road!" The rickshaw comes, and in this case, a not very near road will now cost you 200,000 or 250,000, still with a very calm air.</p>
<p>So you offer him an 80% discount. He doesn't turn his head back, or he turns his head back and glares at you, and then he straddles the car and leaves.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rickshaw driver thinks the place you want to go is too far, ignores you, and leaves. Sometimes, his car is going west, and the place you are going is east, so he refuses to obey. And sometimes, when you promise him 200,000 yuan from a certain road to ×× bridge, although you have not yet reached your destination, he thinks that since he has reached ×× bridge, he should not be called to walk a little more, so he stops, indicating that his labor has already ended here for the price of 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The rickshaw drivers' arrogance is very high. In Shanghai, I know that I have to be careful not to think about the place beyond a certain bridge, but only say to the bottom of the bridge. If you don't prepare to "tip" the expensive fare on a rainy day, you should take another car instead.</p>
<p>Having experienced the arrogance of Shanghai rickshaw drivers, it is really different when you get to Tianjin and Beijing. The rickshaws in Tianjin and Beijing let you jump on any one you want, point a direction, and go wherever you want to go. When you get down, you ask him: "How much is it?" He politely says: "Sir, you can give what you think is appropriate." If the fare you give him exceeds his estimated standard by 20,000 or 30,000, he will definitely say again and again: "Thank you, thank you."</p>
<p>The rickshaw drivers in Tianjin and Beijing never try to rip you off, and the price is usually about one-third lower than in Shanghai, although the price of food in Tianjin and Beijing is much more expensive than in Shanghai. When the price of the staple food corn in the north reaches 120,000 yuan per catty, the life of the rickshaw drivers in Tianjin and Beijing is almost tragic. It is said that their daily income is now about 700,000 or 800,000, excluding 150,000 for car rental, and sometimes they have to repair the car. If a family has three people, it is still very difficult to buy corn to fill their stomachs. But they are disciplined and never mess around. The rickshaw drivers in Tianjin and Beijing never ignore you. If they want to go home, they will politely tell the person calling the car. If you tell him a certain road and have not found your destination after stepping over one or two streets, he will not complain to you, mutter in his mouth, or even stop and argue with you.</p>
<p>The flat and wide roads in Tianjin and Beijing, and the fact that there are fewer people and cars on the street, also make rickshaw passengers feel comfortable. The streets near the Forbidden City at the Qianmen Gate in Beijing, and several streets in the former British and French concessions in Tianjin, are flat and spacious, and the rickshaws are speeding along effortlessly, which cannot be compared with walking half a street in an hour in the central district of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shi Nai'an and the Surname Zhang</h3>
<p>— Songpu</p>
<p>Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin" is extremely widely circulated in our country, enough to be compared with the Four Books of our country and the Bible of the West. To put it in a colloquialism, it is: "Wherever there is water, there is it."</p>
<p>In this magnificent 70-chapter masterpiece, there is a very interesting thing: when falsely claiming a name, many say the surname is "Zhang". For example, when Song Jiang was afraid of being arrested and fled incognito, when people asked his surname, he would reply: "I am Zhang"; when Wu Yong took Li Kui and Lu Junyi to Liangshan, he also told people that Li Kui was "Zhang Heizi"; when Dai Zong took Li Kui to the mountain to find Gongsun Sheng, Gongsun's old mother asked what Li Kui's surname was, and Dai Zong replied: "This person's surname is Zhang"; such examples are endless. In short, when shirking a false surname, it is said in the Water Margin that the surname is "Zhang".</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a random thing, or if it was done on purpose? If you say it was done "accidentally", it doesn't make sense that there would be so many people with the false surname "Zhang" in such a large novel; if you say it was done "on purpose", then Shi Nai'an must have a close relationship with the surname Zhang: either relatives or enemies; otherwise, he would never be so unforgettable about the surname "Zhang".</p>
<h3>The Iron Qin and Bronze Sword Building</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Long days are boring, sorting out the remaining books, I suddenly got a rubbing of the epitaph of Mr. Qu Liangshi, the owner of the Tieqin Tongjian Lou, which was given by Mr. Fengqi. Yan Gu the Elder wrote the text, Xiao Tuwen engraved the cover, and Jiang Zuoma wrote the inscription. They are all excellent choices for a time! In fact, this article was drafted by Yang Wuyang, and Yan Gu the Elder only revised it and wrote the inscription. Qu's family, since his great-grandfather Shaoji, liked to collect books. The Song and Yuan good editions from Shiliju Art Yun Jingshe were scattered, and Qu's family collected most of them, so he built Tianyu Zhai to store them, and Huang Qinliu wrote a record for it; it was the year Gengzi in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. Since he avoided the Qing Emperor Dezong's examination, he changed his name to Tieqin Tongjian Lou. Qu's descendants all liked to collect books. Through repeated changes and chaos, the couplets were all preserved. In the late Qing Dynasty, when Duanfang opened the government in Liangjiang, he planned to take it back to the state-owned, and it was heard that Mr. Zeng Mengpu strongly advocated this proposal; Bao Liangshi was in Beijing, and Liangshi did not move. Ye Juchang copied a hundred kinds of books to present, and the matter was subsided. Juchang's "Ludu Lu Diary" records the matter to the point of fraud, which can be reviewed. In fact, if the collection of the Qian Tang Ding family Shanben Room is all state-owned, it is ultimately easier to preserve than private homes. The Qu family's collection, of which quite a few have been printed in the Four Series, has greatly benefited the scholars. During the chaos of Ding Chou, the Song and Yuan good editions were stored at sea, fortunately without any loss. However, the Ming editions and the writings of Changshu people were all looted by the soldiers. Mr. Liangshi also died in Shanghai. His youngest son, Mr. Fengqi, was proficient in the study of editions, but the world was in chaos like hemp, and it was not easy to protect the couplets! Liangshi's name was Qijia, a native of Changshu, and he once served as a member of the National Assembly. When Cao Kun bribed the presidential election, Mr. returned to the south, and then did not come out. However, he protected and borrowed the local literature of his hometown, and published a record of the writings of the villagers and stored them in the county libraries. Ye Juchang spoke the most about the anecdotes of his family's collection. Huang Wencun Jisongyun compiled the book catalog. Since the Qing Dynasty, there have been dozens of famous book collectors in Yushan, but they have all been washed away by the wind and clouds. Recently, such as Zhao's Tianfang Lou Jiushan Lou, Ding's Chuyuan, and other chaos, are all scattered. As for Shen's Shimizhai Xiren Qi, the descendants have different preferences, and they are all ten or five. If the Qu family can pass on for five generations, and become more prominent in the future, and become a great book collector in the world, it is rare in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Although "not eating" is impossible to live, "eating less" is not impossible. People do need to eat, but the "quantity" of what they take in, and the suitable "quality", vary according to their endowment and their usual lifestyle. This is not lacking in previous examples, and it is not unexpected to observe the facts. Liang Lulin's (Zhong Gongzhi's former residence) Gui Tian Suo Ji quotes Ying Qu's poem to say that the reason why Zhong Sou lived to a long age was, "Measure the stomach daily, and reduce what is received." Bo Wu Zhi says, "The less you eat, the more open your mind is, and the longer you live; the more you eat, the more blocked your mind is, and the more you lose years." This is the principle. As for the facts, it is said, "When I was in Beijing, I served Mr. Dai Keting to ask for advice on the art of curing diseases and prolonging life. The teacher himself said that when he was supervising education in Sichuan, he suffered from a disease similar to weakness, and someone recommended a Taoist priest from Mount Emei to treat him. He sat opposite each other for five days and taught him the method of breathing, and he recovered from fatigue. Now, decades later, he is stronger than before. He gets up early every day and only eats a large bowl of fine porridge, and at noon he eats a cup of human milk. He asked, 'Is this already full?' The teacher said loudly, 'Do people have to eat until they are full'?" This is the difference in "quantity". Liang also recorded his teacher Ji Wenda (Yun) saying, "Ba Gongping never eats grain in his life. He eats noodles occasionally, but he has never tasted rice. He only eats a plate of pork and a pot of tea at mealtime. His banquets are also clean and elegant, and the host only raises his chopsticks." This is the difference in "quality". These are not common examples in life, but they can all become special examples. (If Ji Wenda was born in modern times, he would not be afraid of the price of rice and noodles rising to the sky, because he does not eat grain at all, and only looks for meat shops.)</p>
<p>Dai Keting served as a Hanlin official until he became a minister of state. In his later years, he retired and enjoyed his leisure. He lived to be ninety-five years old. His lifelong learning was profound and intoxicating, and his situation was smooth and comfortable. He was not tempted by things and did not do anything that would harm life, so eating less was beneficial and he was able to live a long life. However, the method of guiding and breathing taught by the Taoist priest of Mount Emei that he described is different from the ancient myths of avoiding grains and becoming immortals, and it should be noted by those who experiment with hygiene. It is not reasonable to say that relying on this technique means that you don't need food rations, but it is not unfounded to save food rations and eliminate the burden of eating. Now Yang Mei is from Sichuan, maybe the method of the Taoist priest of Mount Emei has descendants? In short, special examples are possible, but common examples are impossible; eating less is believable, but not eating is unbelievable. And in the "eating less" and "not eating" of special examples, the distance is very small. Dai Keting's one bowl of porridge every morning and one cup of milk every night is almost not eating when compared to the minimum amount of ordinary people, let alone nine years! Therefore, it is not necessary to treat Yang's girl as too mysterious, even if major scientists examine her personally, it cannot be popularized to the masses and solve the problem of rice and noodles for the public.</p>
