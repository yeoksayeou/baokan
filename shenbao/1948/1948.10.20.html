<h3>赖樸翰在华府招待記者　主張長期經濟援華　至少四年並應有更多款項</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十八日電〕經濟合作總署中國分署署長賴撲翰十八日在記者招待會稱：渠相信美國將來之援華將較目前之四億美元為多，援華計劃亦應有長期計劃，至少須四年。顫氏復稱：渠尚未提出特殊建議，但認為「依吾人支持中國之宗旨，至少應（與目前）有同數款項，余以為彼等應有更多款項」。問以中國財長王掌五所根中國需要至少五億美元，俾向共黨發動有效攻勢一節，賴氏答稱：「對於應需要多少方足為有效之軍事援助，不在余發表意見之範圍以內。但余以為頗應有二億七千五百萬美元以上之經濟援助。余認為中國應得吾人所曾給予之更大注意。如考慮到吾人在使中國成為工業化方面應如何進行一點則十億美元兀極小數目。但吾人亦須老慮到吾人有其他義務，以及吾人所有之資源。余認為現行援華計劃中各方面均應予以增加，并認為駐華技衛團長司徒立門對該問題之探討，殊為合理與健全」。</p>
<p>組樸翰繼稱：「中國需要動力，此等動力現必須得自煤斤或其他燃料，中國亦誰備要運轍，媒斤，燃料，鐵路運輸，航空運轍及動力廠為最屬迫切者。其他項目比較上决要者為台灣之糖與水力發電。廣東省內亦有水力發常之可能性」。</p>
<p>中國為遠東柱石</p>
<p>賴氏歸納樂對對緩蘿計劃諾啓要之意見稱：「余個人之意見為吾人應有較目前一年計劃更為長期之計劃。吾人所根據之原則應自著人自己之立場，以萬中國及其他亞洲國家之立塲觀之均為有價值者。余希望能有更確切更長期之援華計劃，如吾人在歐洲方面一樣」。問以渠是吾認為其他東方國家亦應列入所謂一種「亞洲馬歇爾計劃」之內，賴樸翰答稱：「如欲列入亞洲其他國家，將使此大為州難。吾人必須注重中國共於他國者，因中國為整個遠東之柱石。如估計歐洲復興需數年之久，中國復興或亦不較此為速，余尚未提出任何鑿議，但比為余之觀念」。</p>
<p>對蔣總統表尊敬</p>
<p>賴氏在答覆關於中國電獲安定之前途如何時，鄧震指出中國困於戰學汝內亂已久，並調「以大都份國家而言，戰爭結束以來已達三年，而蘇聯拆除東北及潘陽之工業設僅仄頭為澈底。余相循不論何人負賣中國行政者其任務十分困難，故吾人對彼等之努力應予以同情。余以為彼等的確在努力，余對蔣物申統及政府內其他人員極表鰍敬」。賴樸輸對中國農村復興計劃簽表欣慰，並謂「中國返應繼績進行此不計劃」。</p>
<p>在檢討援華計劃迄今進展情形時，賴氏談稱：二億七千五百萬美元經濟援助基金，已分為各大都市之食物款項計七千萬美元；紡織工業復興里基金七千尤美元；石油產物五千萬美元，肥料一千四百美朮，新配件及復興計謝計七千萬美元；以及行政費用一百萬美元。石汕產物係購自美孚，德士古·亞細亞·及中國政府所辦自日方按收來之中國石油公司四公司。</p>
<p>問以講傳蔣總統可能撤退華北方面國軍之說，賴氏談稱：「現並無跡象表示蔣總統有撤軍之意　以非實際上被迫如此」。</p>
<p>下月初可返抵華</p>
<p>關於美報所控斥，美政府機構現正無麥臨時援華計劃之賬目，因賬民有不能平衡等情之說，賴氏談稱；「賬目正在罰查中，但並非不規情事，中輩救濟因現已結束，並曾被囑以提出最後賬目」。</p>
<p>問以經合啓官員計劃未來之援華，是否假　定為彼等將興現在中國中央政府合作，賴氏明白答稱：「當然，中央政府偽中國之唯一政府。」</p>
<p>賴樸翰繼稱，渠諒將於十天左右赴舊金山，可於十一月初抵華。</p>
<h3>蘇要求延長航空條約　我表示可予考慮　傳大使赴法會晤王外長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕關於蘇聯要求延長中蘇航空條約或另行新的事，我方經外交交通兩部會商決定後，頃已將覆文送出，表示兩國間另行商訂民航協定一節，可予考慮，然並未設明我方願於何時開始是項商談。據外部發嘗人稱：中蘇航約有效期至明年方滿，此一年間蘇聯及中國自有充分時間進行新民航飭定之談判。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十八日電〕我駐蘇大使傳秉常，今午離此飛赴斯德驀爾羅，三等秘書胡濟濟邦行。傳氏係應王外長之召，前往巴寨會晤。</p>
<h3>美國防部證實存日軍火運華</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞華盛頓十九日電〕由於中共加強政府軍壓力所造成之克極局勢，眾信白宮現將決定以價值數百尤美元之軍需物資運往中國。聞美國務院已搜集大批軍極揮　準備運來上海，天津兩城。外傳在麥克阿瑟支配下貯左於日本之若干軍火，亦命其運交中國。此一消息已經美國防部證實。但聞駐日美佔領軍總部之答憂稱，雖則渠等了解中共在中國勝利所造成之不幸後果，然渠等卻無多餘機關槍可供中國政府軍之用。此間義國政界人士皆認為以價值數百萬美元之軍火供給中國，目前巳嫌太遲。又據公正觀察家之意見，美國官方之般意見皆重視中國政府中堂大權者能迅速努力改者中國之則政局勢，並實行若干重要社會及行政改革，最近中國政府所採取之防止通貨膨脹及黑市之措施，美國政界一致予以好評，雖則此項成功極微，然此項措施不失為美國現在研究中之對華續大經濟援助之一項因素。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>談勤儉建國運動</h3>
<p>勤偷，本是數千年來中國民文筆的傳統底美德：獲美德，與其說由於道德理想的實現，無寗說由於實際環境的連成。社會生產制度主要地一向是農業底，勤儉是　業社公中成功的要件。像近幾十年天災人禍不斷地發生之際，民生凋敝，一般才百姓尤其不能不勤儉，不勤儉就無以免於餓寒死亡。所以就一般民眾而言，勤儉運動似乎是多餘底。目前不勤不儉者，只是都市中少數有錢與有閒階級底豪門富戶；他們造成　者　　送的風氣，自己中了毒，遠在流母於全國，影寗及於市塲的奸詐和政府的貪污腐敗。他們的確是現在中國社會的蛀蟲，勤儉運動當以這批人為對象。這批人已到怙亞不悛底地步，非空談勤儉所可感化底。我們當首先探求他們不勤不儉的根源，然後從根源上着手，做鞋跟新底工夫，我們以為這是一個社會制度的問題，而不只是一個道德理想的問題；解決的辦法，也在建立人人不能不勤不儉的環境　大勢，而不只在把勤儉當作美德云宣傳或勸導。</p>
<p>豪門富戶以不勤，因為他們無須勤。他們擁有超過生活必脚面限度底資產，並且馮藉這道過度底資產，幣用旁人的勞力，云櫐積　更多底過度底資產，不稼不　，不狩不獵，袖手優游，坐事其成。他們在社會中是寄生階級，吮他人的血而自肥。這種寄生階級在一個禛　支中可以存在，那個社會就知必有終被蛀空的一日，這是無疑養底。追究責任，與其說在這寄生階級，無寗说在社會本身。因为情性是人與一切物質所生而就有底，社會旣尤許一個人可以審勞而獲，他如果拒絕這個恩憲，就未免達背天性。所以勸動的很本辦法，是在建立一个非勞不擭的環境大勞，而耍達到這償目的，使人人在生存竸爭中處在平等底地位，有平苓底機會，唯一底途徑也就在打破目前這個不勞可獲的局面。打破不勞可獲的局面也並無什麼秘訣，只要限制超遴生活補要誤度度竇饉，出一分力就有一分收獲，不出方就不能有收樓。消費的經濟膩則聶量入（收入）為出（消費），生產分配的經濟原則應該是量出（勞力）為入（報酬）。像這樣辦，勤勉纔有所獎勉，懶惰纔有所穩戒。這是一般生物的生存競爭優勝劣敗的大原則，人類社會當然不是例外。所以依我們的看法，目前政府的勸儉建國的呼聲，恐怕還是像許多其它類似底宣傳口號一樣，是扔在沙漢裏。如果它不肯想出一個有效底辦法，大刀闊斧地剷除豪門資木，並且限制一切超過生活需要限度底資產。</p>
<p>在同一原則之下，我們熊該建立一個健全底考試和銓敘制度。目前惰性最深底是官吏，從鄉鎮保甲長以至於中樞大員；原因在他們的進身之階大牛不是自已的本領和勞績，而是黨派和門閥的勢力，以及私人的　營狗荀底奔走趙營。黃　既可倖進，本領和勞績就勢必屈居下風，而一般人也就無須努力掙得本領和勞績，只須盡全力於數衍隨和，就可以保位固寵。大家相電成　，流　愈推愈達，以　　今日　塲的這個　基　安的局面。勤儉建國運動所針　庭當然正是這種局面。但是這　局面已根深蒂圓，絕非宣傳口號所可救義。險轉就要新　，目前底禍根就在獎勵黃綠倖進嚴　一奮人寫制度。所以我們必須　文一個健全底老試與雜戴制度，正正考該，憑能授職。馮　定度，馮功過定獎懲。社會中如果沒有一個人能魚　倖進，就不會有一個人不明暸努力的價值，威是存不努力而可上進的希望。</p>
<p>其次，豪門富戶之所以不儉，原因不外兩種：第一　與上述木勞而獲一點有關。他們不知線錢之艱難，錢來得容易就去得容易。人生來有些祇劣底慾望，有滿足這些憊望底憑務而社會又無　制的力量，他們要去滿足它們，太是顧着自然底趨勢。所以要防止他們驕奢淫送，只要逼他們憑自己的努力換取生活釣資源；他們知道勸了，就自然會知道儉。其次，他們所以不儉，也由於社會配給制度的不存在或不完善，容許他們有過度底和不正當底亨受。他們有底是錢，錢又能通神，要買什麼就有什麼可買，社會不但不加以限制或非談，反而以為這是可欣義底榮耀。在容忍而發獎掖之下，他們不苛刻自已，也是順着自然底趨勢。所以澈底訪奢勸儉，就要建立合理底消耗分配制度，如現在英國所採用庭，嚴禁奢侈品的製造與輸入，並且嚴藥必儒品的不公平底分訛。你只須吃飯，無須抽烟暍酒，就不許有烟酒。你每日只須吃一斤米，也就不許貿得一斤一兩。這樣地辦，人人平等，不容許你不儉，儘管你錢多或是地位高</p>
<p>在中國倫理底宇　中，勸儉向來並畢。各民族沒有不奉勤為　德底，各民族討於儉庭看重與騙勉，則以中臘民　急最　着，其實兩者之中，　　比儉　重要。勤是創　吳生重的要件，檢只是事受上底節約；勤偏在開源，儉　在節流；所以勤是積極底而儉只是清極底，儉未嘗不是一種美　，但是我們不必過分地着重。人类文明進慶，無論在物質方面取在精神方面，都應該向生活的豐常寬豁方面走。一代的奢侈。變成一下代的必需。需要是文明進慶的保進力，也是人類努力的一績鞭策，創　與生產的一種推動　。過度底儉約可以議成生活的乾枯與文明進展的伴滯。尤其在生活水舉太來極低底中國，我們不必再鼓吹一般人再把生活永凖優望下降低。我們已夠緊輸了，再緊縮便要蘇喪生楊與生　。我們所要提倡底是創造與生產，是開發較當裕生活的泉源。我們要提出一個究善底方案，建立一個究善底制度，使人人能盡量地發揮他的潛能，以他自己的努力換取他的生活的豐富與寬裕。儉或可彌補已成形底災荒，要眞正建國，只有勸　可濟事。勤也要有一個用武之地，目前中國社會像一架停了擺底機器，時廠裏許多機工都在強迫怠工的情形之下，抱着勝子呆望着。這中間不知道有多少力量的浪費与生機的遏抑。現在空提一個口號實在無濟於事，我們必須把這強迫怠工的情形除去，把這架教器再發動起來，使各部門底人都可站在目己的崗位，發揮自已的效能，這就是說，农村要復興起來；工廠要建設起來，一切公益底事業要推動起來。</p>
<p>这都是極淺而易見庇道理。我們無用高深底理論，也無須大吹大摧底宣傳。說不難，難在做；做也不難，難在掌握政權者肯從自己做起，埋頭苦幹，實事求是，樹立一種新風氣。（寗自北大）</p>

<h3>安理會討論柏林事件　三強重申堅決立場　封鎖未解除拒談德國問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十九日廣播：安理會十九日下午開會，蘇外次維辛斯慕雖崽感層，仍出席會議。英代表賈德幹苜先代表西方列強發言，攻擊蘇聯加緊柏林對鎖之不當。維辛斯某頻頻咳嗽嘖嚏，打斷買氏之言辭。代理全席勃拉罵格里亞要求賈氏提供對教及其他有關事項之詳情，賈德幹卽答稱，蘇聯之種種限制依然存在，任何計劃之擬其及實施，們仍必須在繼續對鎖之壓力下進行，則定必遭退同樣之命運。賈氏烯望安理會能接受西方所特在封鎖之威脅下不能進符談判之見解。渠謂聯合國及安理會之感信已臨存亡關頭。</p>
<p>同時英代表亞歷山大發表談話謂，西方三強現有一種感覺，即使依據八月三十日與史達林成立之協議與蘇聯繼續談判，亦屬不可能。按當時西方列強曾原則上接受蘇聯馬克為柏林之唯一通貨，作為解除對鎖之交換條件，但此項協議在柏林談判中間復被打銷。</p>
<p>〔會鐵社巴黎十九日電〕西方三強十九日正式通知安理會，在柏林對鎖未解除前，渠等不願與蘇聯討飾任何德國問題。三強並強調，柏林封鎖為閉塞四強重行談判任何或全部德國問題之唯一原因。在安理會霍行開始辯論柏林問題時，英代表賈德幹代表三強，重申三強在柏林危機中之堅定立場。渠答覆安理會在上週提出之兩項問題中之第一項，美代表傑賽普將在嗣後答覆第二項問題。賈德幹答覆之問題為：關於設置封鎖之詳情友目前之狀況，渠提出一長篇之正式答覆及附屬文件，然技簡略解釋西方國家之立場。渠警告安理會稱，西方國家在安理會提出之唯一問題，即為蘇聯之非法封鎖柏林，此事不但係解決一項危急性之爭端，而且與聯合國之威信有關。述及蘇聯片面設置封鑽時，賣德幹稱，此係一種威迫性的企圖，阻止其他三佔頒國家執行彼等之合法權利。渠次卽指出封鎖已繼續大閱月，此顯然運反聯合國會員會不得運用武力以達成政治目的之規定。最後渠指稱，「事實現巳非常明顯，封鎖之維續為阻止四強談判之唯一原因」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴鑿十九日電〕蘇聯十九日在聯合國會議中發佈其對柏林問題之白皮書，該文並未包括對蘇聯在解除柏林封鎖談判中展史性之文件作評論。該書首篇文字為褓聯於二月十三日致三強之照會，抗議三強計劃成立西德政府。據悉，蘇聯選擇該文字為首篇之原因，乃在指出蘇聯認為微妙之柏林危機於此時開始，並非於實行封鎖時開始。</p>

<p>渠稱，渠於十七日以海底電報通知變方，接受立卽及無條伴休戰四天之命令。埃及表示如以色列接受，則願接受休戰，但以色列則僅提議與埃及談判，以和平解決尼基夫爭端，而漢視休戰之要求。</p>
<p>十九日之休戰令，為安理會對巴勒斯坦問題之第三次主耍決議，蘇聯在投票時，拒絕對彭契提出之決定尼基失問題未來談判條件之建議表決，因安理會尚來加以討論，渠認偽目前唯一重要之事務為發布休戰令。安理會建議談判之條件如次：（一）阿猶雙方撤退最近在尼基夫衝突時所佔領地以之軍隊。（二）雙方接受聯合國休戰監督委負會之護運命令。（三）雙方同意通過聯合國調解員或直接談判尼基夫之主要問題，並允許聯合國觀察員永久劊駐該區。</p>

<p>舫建公司昨循例配布，品類巳棘稀少，祇開出十二磅喇叭　B細布，價廿四元，（限門市）申購。副牌28碼半嗶嘰，價廿三元五角，（限染廠）請購，金運妙舞元嗶變，每疋廿七元六角，（限門市）申購。孩車　白府綢每疋廿七元，（限內衣業）請購·其他花色貨均未列入配售，惟另有〇〇二—B二〇美花色布，堅俏。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於染織業第三期第二批配布，本定前日下午一點，在棉布公會市場內舉辦申購手續，嗣因貨額不多，地於配銷技衛，尚須改善，故延至昨日上午十時，該會召開理監事緊急聯席會議，提付討論。聞以批發商要求織續承配－事，為主要議案，結果決議照配。至本期配布事，決於下午－時起辦理　業請購手續，計有　　被單布時一萬五千馀疋，全數配出云。</p>
<h3>棉市呆軟</h3>
<p>現棉自聯購會公佈價格後，同業已無交易，而產地喊價又較滬上為高，棉商營業巳成停頓狀態，一都份執戶似有脫意。</p>
<h3>取消票貼</h3>
<p>金管局令卽日實行</p>
<p>〔太報訊〕金管局頃舉財政部令，卽日停止各銀錢行莊及信託公司向客戶收取票貼，已由該局照案分令太市銀錢託三業公會，轉飭各會員行莊公司遵照。</p>
<h3>天雨到貨略減　米市交易仍稀</h3>
<p>食米到貨接種而來，昨日因天雨，故較上日略減，但市場交易，仍不見好轉，到貨大都分派與少數米店，多數米店仍無米可購，價格仍按原價不動。昨日到米。南市塲米行及米廠為九七四石南市場米行及米廠為九七四石一斗，米號四入二石，北市場米行一七二石，米號一六七石，廠方七二二石，業外自辦米五　　石，合計二市場到貨為三千零千七石。</p>
<p>麵粉依舊未開。難糧計黃豆有九江冬豆五十包交易，價為十四元六角大分。關對生仁提莊及統貨共開四百馀包，其他苞米元麥紅糧，一致未開。</p>
<p>茶市堅秀週來洋莊茶市，因吐納兩稀，過程久居岑靜，而昨市更見清淡，但持貨老心思，仍以產存均涸，穩健若昔，市氣遂猶堅秀。頃秀：本市輸出商　　門紅茶，英倫青諫仍亟，故一俟天睛，卽擬　前與賣戶談判。至於內銷茶，渝縈買氣隊匿，他若本街興蘇，錫，常，問訊尚有，惜供舊不多，交易狹窄，而價格奇挺。</p>
<h3>絲綢堅挺</h3>
<p>人絲市況趨勢續呈呆頓，交易冷落，絲號門銷購者愈多，供者愈少，公會配售量昨日仍配出三十五小包，生絲外銷貨昨日交易聞有談判，但因價格未符，仍未成交。內銷貨絲號存底甚薄，廠方開售亦少，人心俏利，執戶大多觀望，交易未聞做開。</p>
<p>綢緞絲織業因原料不易購進，成品開出轉稀，各號存底尚豐，惟在限價下頗多不願股舊，市場已無整批成交，綢莊門市自憑證購買後，去銷略見清淡，而陳列之花色亦多冷門貨，故近日營業已非前日搶購之盛。</p>

<h3>本市獎學金統審會　通過本屆獎助名額　各校分配數額待審查會決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市獎學金統一審核委員會昨日下午三時在申報館五樓開會，規定冊七年度第一學期各級學校獎學金學生名額，及每一得獎學生獎學金數額。獎金總數共十五萬金圓，獎學金舉生共一萬二千三百名。各校分配名額尚待該會召開審查會議決定。</p>
<p>出席昨日會識者有正副主委潘公展。李熙謀及各機關國體代表。首由潘主委報告：略謂本次辦理獎學金極為嚴格，凡免費生尚未足額之學校申詩時均已拒收。各校送審時，並需將全校學生總數報會，以作分配各額比例時之根據，其有浮報者，由會議處。</p>
<p>各校申請人數</p>
<p>（一）公立專科以上學較申請獎學金學生共計一三九三人。（二）私立專科以上學校申請獎學金學生共計二〇六一人。其中大夏大學尚未送審，光華大學免費不足額。（三）公立中學申請獎學金學生共計一一二三人。其中格致中學及同濟附中未報學生總數。（四）私立中學申請獎學金學生共計－七〇五上。其中民治。正始等卅四校未送免費生名冊。廣澄藥職。錫華等十三校則免費不足額。（五）私立小學申請獎學金學生共計三五五八人。其中文昌。市西二校未報學生人數。培蒙。暨陽等十六校，則免費不足額．潘主委認為開學已久，獎學金之發放不能再拖延，希望能早日結束工作，按照現已募得之款，先行分配，以後如再絡續有捐款送來，可再開會審核發放。繼由總幹事鄭傑報告委託該會代發已收得之獎學金共十萬零六千一百卅六圓六角二分，連同捐款團體直接發放及已認捐尚未送會等款項，共約十五萬圓。經出席者就此十五萬圓分配，討論規定各級學校獎學金學生名額，及每一得獎學生獎學金數額如下：</p>
<p>獎助名額金額（一）公立專科以上學校：每名二十圓者六百名，每名卅圓者三百名。（二）私立專科以上學校：每名卅圓者一千名，每名四十圓者三百名，每名六十圓者三百名?（一）公立中學：每名十圓者八百名。（四）私立中學：每名十五圓者入百名，每名二十圓者四百名，每名廿五圓者三百名。（五）市立郊區國民學校：每名一圓者五千名。（六）私立小學：每名十圓者一千八百各，每名十五圓者七百名。</p>
<p>其他決議事項其他決議事項如下：（一）浮報學生總數之學校，除按教局存查之寶在人數核發獎金外，由教局對各該校長予以處分。（二）未邊免費學生名冊之學校，仍照常審核。對申請合格之學生通知其向學校申請免費，待學校之免費額足後，再由會議核發。（三）各校於學期終了時應將領受獎學金學生之學業及操行成績送會，以資考核。</p>
<p>李副主委昨於會中建議，自下學期起，對領受獎學金之中學及專科以上學校學生，應使其稍盡義務，其方式將採取工讀性質。出席者對此原則多表贊同。</p>
<h3>本報助學手續</h3>
<p>又申報助學金之核發與獎學金統審委會之手續相同，須由各校先行造送免費生各冊。近有學校學生，以為該項助學金遲遍未發，紛紛來函詢問。其實由於未明手續，希望能催請各校造送名冊，俾該項工作可早日完成。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕教部頃將國外專科以上學校名單，以部令廢止。　此項名單係從前向國外調查而開列，以為指導出國留學生入外國壓校之參考。戰後情形不同，且未便依照銓敘國外留學生資格之根據，故特明令廢止，至現在歐美各國專科以上學校設校現狀，雖經調查，尚無統計名單。</p>

<h3>官俸</h3>
<p>— 朱蘭客</p>
<p>自古千里為官，雖然目的決非為了发財，可是最低限度，也總得解決吃飯問題．所以「官俸」這個名詞，顧名思義，簡單的說，就是公務員的生活費用。除了公務員的官俸而外，其他的如「束脩」「鐵點費」「包銀」等等，名稱雖異，效用則一，都是必須能夠滿足最低限度的生活需求，才能認為合理，公務員的官俸，如能不能維特最低限度的生活，那麼小焉者必影響工作之效率，大焉者必關乎國運之隆替，國家實際上損失之鉅大，絕不是減少了若干預算數字所能彌補的。</p>
<p>整代的官俸，就史書所載，可以看出來，大約國運隆盛的朝代，繼較劉運衰徽的朝代為高。漢朝自高祖登位，一統天下，丞相三公官俸號萬石，中郎將比二千石，丞相長史千石，廷尉千石，縣令六百石至三百石。根據漢聲師古注，所謂萬石，實際上代表每月三百五十斛，比二千石為百斛，千石為九十斛，五百石為七士斛，三百石為四十斛。考自宋代起，五斗偽一斛，漢代還是十斗為一斛，所以最起碼的七品官兒也有四十石米的月俸。</p>
<p>五胡亂華之後，久經變亂，例如後魏之初，實沒有官俸制度，所以清廉的官史貧苦異常。北史高尤傳說：「高允草屋數間，布被繼袍，府中惟盬菜，常令諸子採樵自給。」為官一貧如此，較之現在的窮公務員，有過之無不及，景況侈悲慘了。常時的一般賞吏，則取給於富豪，祗要善於結納，便能縱橫如意，手段相當高明。至孝文帝太和八年，方才班俸祇之制，每人絹二疋，獻二斛九升，數量的微薄，較之漢代，眞是不可同日而語。陶靖節的不為購斗米而折腰，也是發生在道個混亂的時期中。</p>
<p>經過了五代的混亂時期，至朱而四方平靖。朱朝的官俸，宰相參知政事樞密使，月二百石，各軍節度使月一百五十石，刺史月五十石，諸縣令月五石至三石有三等，比起漢朝來，還是差得很遠。</p>
<p>元朝的官俸，是俸米混合制，俸以品級大小而定，米則以其職事的繁簡而定，俸多而米少；太師太傅太保左丞相月十五石，六部尚書月八石，侍郎月五石，司業至博士自三石五斗至二石五斗有差，有些像現在公教人員的三斗配給米，可是數量方面超過今日多多了。</p>
<p>明代的官俸，又恢復全部祿米制，正一品月俸米八十七石，從一品至三品遞减十三石至三十五石，從三品二十六石，正六品十石，正七品至從九品月自七石五斗至三石止，還遠不及宋朝的官俸優厚。</p>
<p>自清以降，公務員的俸給，更是一代不如一代，每況而愈下。到了現在，上自「選」「特」任，下至官員，除了有特殊收入的是例外，其差別不過是「小貧」「赤貧」而已。最近官俸已釘住四十金圓的基數，然而物價卻並米見得穩定，未來公務員的悲慘前途，實令人不忍想像下去。</p>
<h3>病態養成所</h3>
<p>— 忘我</p>
<p>讀「低能的製造者」一文，覺得作者以生活經驗，寫來深中時弊，一定博得」同聲浩嘆」。</p>
<p>那是一篇關於討論中等教育的話。這里談一些現實的小學教育，雖說見仁見智，但事關後一代的幸福，似乎不能淡然置之。</p>
<p>跑遍了上海的小學—恕不引用那冗長的名稱，因覓所謂「國民」，還不會見成人入學。—多的是面贊或肌瘦的孩子們，不是先天不足，便是後天失諷，在家裹幾乎成為一個討厭的東西。就此往學校裏一推。</p>
<p>學校經過一番「諸覲好友概不賒欠」的收賬手續，把孩子接受進來，於是便施以所謂「教管嚴密」的手術，有的還動用「注重英國算三科」的刀子，古法泡製，修合雖無人見，大概存心只有天知了。</p>
<p>三年級就敎英語，背·默。寫，一個八歲不足的孩子硬要他潔通　面語言，何寄厚國之重也!</p>
<p>國語之外，還有國文，外加尺度．作文之外，還有　記。外加日記?讀一課，背一課，默一條．抄筆記，查注解。有的孩子寫著：「壞！祭天地日月之所在」。「　！大澤」。不是莫明其妙，便是詹查　　。好在不求甚解，考時能依樣葫蘆，只字不改，就算是好學生了。</p>
<p>算有筆算，珠算，有跳上一年至二年之難題補充。這里沒有速算技衛的傳授。卻有無數難題來作難。所以孩子體管呆鈍。學校究底不失「認真」的令。</p>
<p>學校有了「名譽」，不怕不「客滿」。有狹長的統廂房擠坐近百人者，自有「議貨」的家長硬要呌子弟再挨一腳，甚至立着旁聽，大有程門立着之概。</p>
<p>一節課有三刻鐘甚至一小時者，據說這是「貨真價實」。一天上足八小時，當然更能「以廣招徠」了。</p>
<p>教學沒有方法，這種復古的作風在「著名」的私校尤其顯著。於是，兒童的體格，習慣，日趨下游，怎不呌人憂心如搗？</p>
<p>可悲的病態養成所呀！</p>
<h3>人名與地名</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>關於著述，尤其是與史事有關的寫作，人名與地名，是文章構成的必需材料。因之，對於人名地名的解謂，各有不同，如「我的朋友胡適之」，巳經給人們所譏評，不必談了。其他因作者與被稱的關係不同，而有稱先生，君·公·丈·嗡·前輩·女士·或我友等，都沒有什麼關係。而我卻主張直呼其名，或是先寫他的號，名用括弧表出，如「徐季龍（識）」，以後則只稱季龍或用徐氏了。萬一和我沒有關係的，為了行文便利與讀者易於認識起見，是直寫其名，如徐世昌·趙爾巽·王閱運·齊燮元等。</p>
<p>現在有些人對於滿清官吏與科舉中人，或民國軍閥時期的官僚，往往用清謐，用科甲，用籍頁來稱呼，不直寫其名。道種習慣，是封建的餘毒，如甲文忠公，乙文正公，丙正惠公，丁文襄久之類．或是子制軍，丑中丞，，寅太守，卯大令；或是春殿撰，夏太史，秋孝廉，冬上舍；和曾湘鄕，翁常熟，康南海，梁新會等便是。這種稱謂，在民國時代，還有出現，那就革命似是多餘。不過其中有一點值得注意的，就是功業彪炳的革命黨人，卻不喜這一套，如陳少白·黃興·胡漢民·陳其美·宋教仁等，從沒有人呌他們為陳新會·黃長沙（本屬者化後併稱長沙）。胡番禺。陳吳興·宋桃源·在北政府統治下時期，還有什麼袁項城。黎黃破·馮河間·徐東海·段合肥等的稱呼·而革命政府的國府主席譚延閱·林森等，黨內外的都沒有人呌他們為譚茶陵·林閩侯，五院的院長，也沒有用他們的籍賞來稱呼。從這一點看來，可見得社會的人對終滿清歷史遺下的官紳與北政府的官僚是同等看街。</p>
<p>滿清傾覆以後，薄儀從民元而至偽滿崩潰為止；對於有些會服官清廷的去世，還是予說，甚至傳儀在長春做了什麼「皇帝」，對於謀變璨之死，也　「文忠」。那時傳儀久已不是所謂「大清皇帝」！陳實琛也不是偽滿的臣子，不知道溥饑根據了什麼來隊陳為「文忠」這真是糊塗人做糊塗事。而有些人還是沿用民國成立後薄儀非法等說，那就真有點不解了。</p>
<p>又有寫地名好用古名，如南京稱白下或建業，鎮江稱京口，廣州稱楚庭，蕪湖稱繙茲，杭縣稱仁和等，這是顛倒時代，使嚷者非查老辭書，無從明自。到了民國三十七年，而還用這一套，似乎與時代和思想，都有關。我卻不敢苟同了。</p>
<h3>秋天裹的春天</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>前天，有一位朋友告訴我說，他家的海棠開了。（卻不是秋海棠，俗所謂鐵梗海棠，十在春天開的。）今天我偶然涉足後園，卻也見到夭桃正在作花。現在正是夏層的九月初，倘使由舊腦筋看來，這真是所謂災異，似乎可以載入五行志草妖類。同時更耍唏噓嗟嘆地，說什麼天人相感的大道理。或是有些人要說，近幾天來天氣太熱，草木反常，也不算得什麼一會事兒，所謂十月是小春也。但可惜現在還在九月初</p>
<p>我個人的意見則對此並不驚奇，反而感到無窮的希望。現在是秋天，世界的人類也為了未來的戰爭擔憂而滿懷感到秋意。但我相信人類決不會愚笨到這個地步，竟會一致趨向自殺的途徑。解救人類還是人類自己。——在秋天裏桃花開放，海棠開放，已經預示我們秋天裹已有春天的氣息。「春非我春，秋非我秋」那些話祗有十足消極的人總會說的。我們要努力，不光是期待。</p>
<h3>好萊塢的　無名英雄</h3>
<p>— 斐宇</p>
<p>好萊塢的生意就靠著兩樣東西：一是明星，二是道具。</p>
<p>每家影片公司都有有著數百萬元無奇不有的道具，這些道具全是由專司供給道具的人收羅來的。這些人個個都是機警盡敏。無孔不入的傢伙。只要導演說聲要用什麼道具，不管是否重要，他們總會想法辦到的。</p>
<p>有一幕電影要要用一架西班牙大鋼琴。一個道具供給者總算在一位老太太那裹我到了一架，但是卻沒有辦法搬出來，原來屋子裏的一扇大窗在一次盜警之後已經封沒了。後來化了許多錢，主人才答應把牆拆掉。等到戲拍好將鋼琴搬回，把牆重新砌好，導演卻派人來說，那幕鏡頭拍得不好，鋼譯要再用一次。</p>
<p>一次正當大隊人馬在馬加大沙漢裹拍戲的時侯，導演忽然想到女主角需要一束花。花？在一個整月不下雨的大沙漢裏？可是在二點鐘之內，管道具的人拿者各式各樣的花來了，這是他攔住了一輛火車，從車上搜購得來的。</p>
<p>有時候幾只蚊子也會成大問題。勞勃·蒙高茂萊在一張新片中要用幾只活蚊子，拍片的時候部在嚴寒的正月。管道具的人們搜遍了每所大學和昆蟲研究所，但所能得到的蚊子全是要傳染瘧疾和黃熱病的，所以不能用。於是他們到處去找尋有孑孑活着的池塘，找到就把池水裝回來放在暖室裹。十天後，勞勃此在攝影機前拍着蚊子了。</p>
<p>在另外一張片子裏，有個男主角吃西瓜的鏡頭，劇本在七月寫好，戲卻要到一月才開拍。於是管道具的人其設法把西瓜保藏起來。他先買了一打西瓜，把兩個塗蠟，兩個塗膠，兩個顏料，兩們裏上麻布，兩個放進冰箱，兩個放在冰塊上。一個月後一看，只有冰硬的兩只是好的。但是這兩只一見熟說自己裂開，並且漸漸變成軟軟的一堆爛東西了。於是他再買了兩打，有的埋在地下，有的埋在石灰　裏，有的放在水中浸着。一月之後，覺全都爛了。那時西瓜差不多業已過時，他完全覺得絕望了，他又去買了五打最好的西瓜，用他知道的這種不同的方法保藏起來。到了拍這鏡頭的那一天，僥倖得很，總算還有一只好的。他得意地捧了去見導演，告訴他這只西瓜的故事。那時恰巧編劇也在旁邊聰到了。</p>
<p>「我要早知道這會給你這些麻煩，」這位編劇對他說，「我只要呌主角吃只蘋果好了。」</p>
<p>這些管道具的人們都是令人驚奇的傢伙，不過他們總是痛恨着編劇和導演的。</p>
<h3>秩序</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>凡是有過教學經驗的人，都知道維持教室秩序是一最重要而又最困難的問題。良好的教室秩序，是優良教學的前提，也正是優良教學的徵象。</p>
<p>教室如廟會，人聲鼎沸，真是極糟的秩序；但若把教室弄得有如古墓，陰森靜　，也不是教學上所謂良好的秩序。所以班勒特說．「教室中好秩序的象徽，不在寂靜至於能聞針落之聲，而在有快活的勞作之聲；不在有緊張的抑制，而在有強烈的活動。」因之，「教室中秩序的管理，不在堅迫活動，而在刺激活動；不在禁止某事某事，而在創作某事某事。」</p>
<p>大概一般模式的教師，常為了要使教室達到「寂靜至於能聞針落之聲」，而不惜對學生致力「壓迫活動」，「禁止某事某事」；結果，把教室弄得死氣沉沉。－般新式的教師，則常為了要使室內學生表現「快活的勞作之聲」，或「強烈的活動」，便凡事流於放縱，儘量刺激學生活動，為他們「創作某事某事」，大開方便之鬥；結果是，把教室弄得人喊馬嘶，鷥啼鵲噪。</p>
<p>以上兩種辦法和情形，都是教學上所嚴忌的。理想的教室秩序是：一方面有快活的勞作之聲，一方面並不混亂嘈難。欲達到此一境地，是－件最困難的事。普遍都是得之於此一方面，便失之於彼一方面，很少能兼　而並着的。</p>
<p>現在且把觀點展開，推之於社會秩席亦然。一味用高壓手段，不許人民自由活動，此之謂封建作風；完全放任，養成人民囂張狂妄的氣燄，也可說是民主的歪曲；前者是真封建，而後者是偽民主，都非新中國新社會的理想。理想如何呢？很簡單，既要民主，亦要安定。但如何建　此一境地呢？現在的困難也就正在於此了。</p>

<h3>On the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Thrift</h3>
<p>Diligence and thrift have always been the traditional virtues of Chinese people for thousands of years. This virtue, rather than being due to the realization of a moral ideal, is more due to the formation of the actual environment. Since the social production system has mainly been agricultural, diligence and thrift are the keys to success in an agricultural society. Especially in recent decades, when natural disasters and man-made calamities have occurred constantly, and people's livelihoods have declined, ordinary people must be diligent and thrifty, or they will inevitably suffer from hunger, cold, and death. Therefore, as far as the general public is concerned, a diligence and thrift movement seems superfluous. Currently, those who are not diligent and thrifty are only the few wealthy and leisurely classes in the cities; they have created a wasteful atmosphere, poisoning themselves and spreading their influence to the whole country, affecting the market's cunning and the government's corruption. They are indeed the蛀虫 of Chinese society today, and the diligence and thrift movement should target this group of people. These people have reached the point of incorrigibility and cannot be influenced by empty talk about diligence and thrift. We should first explore the root causes of their lack of diligence and thrift, and then start from the root causes to carry out thorough reforms. We believe that this is a matter of social system, not just a moral ideal; the solution also lies in creating an environment in which everyone cannot but be diligent and thrifty, rather than just promoting or persuading people to regard diligence and thrift as virtues.</p>
<p>The wealthy are not diligent because they do not need to be diligent. They possess assets beyond the limits of what is necessary for life, and by virtue of these excessive assets, they employ the labor of others to accumulate more excessive assets, neither farming nor weaving, neither hunting nor foraging, folding their hands and waiting for success. They are a parasitic class in society, sucking the blood of others to fatten themselves. A society in which such a parasitic class can exist is bound to be hollowed out one day; there is no doubt about that. To investigate the responsibility, it lies more with society itself than with this parasitic class. Because emotion is inherent in people and all things, if society allows a person to gain without labor, it would be against human nature for him to refuse this favor. Therefore, the fundamental way to persuade them is to create a non-labor-no-gain environment, and to achieve this goal, to put everyone on an equal footing in the competition for survival, with equal opportunities, the only way is to break the current situation where one can gain without labor. There is no secret to breaking the situation where one can gain without labor; just limit the excessive accumulation of assets beyond what is necessary for life. One share of effort will yield one share of reward, and no effort will yield no reward. The economic principle of consumption should be based on income (revenue) to determine expenditure (consumption), and the economic principle of production and distribution should be based on output (labor) to determine input (reward). In this way, diligence will be rewarded, and laziness will be punished. This is the general principle of survival competition, the survival of the fittest, and human society is certainly no exception. Therefore, in our view, the current government's call for national construction through thrift is probably like many other similar slogans, thrown in the sand. If it is unwilling to come up with an effective way to drastically eradicate the capital of the wealthy and limit all assets that exceed the limits of what is necessary for life.</p>
<p>Under the same principle, we should establish a sound examination and appointment system. The deepest-rooted laziness currently lies with officials, from township and baojia chiefs to central government officials; the reason is that their path to promotion is not based on their own abilities and achievements, but on the power of parties and factions, as well as private scheming and running around. Since mediocrity can be promoted by chance, ability and achievement are bound to take a back seat, and the general public does not need to strive to gain ability and achievement, but only needs to do their best to flatter and follow, to secure their positions. Everyone imitates each other, and the situation gets worse and worse, leading to the current unstable situation in the officialdom. The diligence and thrift national construction movement is, of course, aimed at this situation. But this situation is deeply rooted and cannot be saved by slogans. Reform requires innovation. The current root of disaster lies in rewarding mediocrity and suppressing hard work and the merit system. Therefore, we must establish a sound examination and appointment system, conduct fair examinations, and appoint people based on their abilities. Based on the system, based on merit, determine rewards and punishments. If no one in society can be promoted by chance, no one will fail to understand the value of effort, or harbor the hope of advancing without effort.</p>
<p>Secondly, the reason why the wealthy are not thrifty is nothing more than two reasons: First, it is related to the above-mentioned non-labor-no-gain situation. They do not know the difficulty of earning money, and money that comes easily goes easily. People are born with some inferior desires, and if they have the means to satisfy these desires and society has no restricting power, they will satisfy them, following the natural trend. Therefore, to prevent them from being extravagant and lustful, just force them to earn the resources for life through their own efforts; when they know the difficulty of earning, they will naturally know the need for thrift. Secondly, they are not thrifty because the social distribution system does not exist or is imperfect, allowing them to have excessive and improper enjoyment. What they have is money, and money can do anything. They can buy whatever they want. Society not only does not restrict or criticize them but considers this a gratifying glory. Under tolerance and encouragement, they do not treat themselves harshly, which is also following the natural trend. Therefore, to thoroughly prevent extravagance and encourage thrift, we must establish a reasonable consumption and distribution system, such as the one currently adopted in England, strictly prohibiting the manufacture and import of luxury goods, and strictly prohibiting the unfair distribution of essential goods. If you only need to eat, not smoke or drink, then smoking and drinking are not allowed. If you only need to eat one jin of rice per day, you are not allowed to buy one jin and one liang. By doing this, everyone is equal, and you are not allowed to be thrifty, no matter how much money you have or how high your position.</p>
<p>In the Chinese ethical system, frugality has always been emphasized. There is no nation that does not regard diligence as a virtue, and among all nations, the Chinese people are most concerned with and encourage thrift. In fact, between the two, diligence is more important than thrift. Diligence is the key to creation and wealth, while thrift is only the conservation of enjoyment; diligence focuses on increasing income, while thrift focuses on reducing expenditure; therefore, diligence is active, while thrift is passive. Thrift is not necessarily a virtue, but we do not need to overemphasize it. Human civilization should move towards abundance and breadth of life, whether in material or spiritual aspects. One generation's extravagance becomes the next generation's necessity. Need is the driving force of civilization and a whip to human effort, a driving force of creation and production. Excessive thrift can lead to dryness of life and stagnation of civilization. Especially in China, where living standards are already extremely low, we do not need to encourage the general public to lower their living standards further. We have already tightened our belts enough; tightening them further will lead to the loss of life and vitality. What we want to promote is creation and production, the development of a source of abundance in life. We want to propose a perfect plan and establish a perfect system so that everyone can maximize their potential and exchange their own efforts for the abundance and breadth of their lives. Thrift may make up for existing disasters, but only diligence can truly build the country. Diligence also needs a place to be used. Currently, Chinese society is like a stalled machine, with many workers in the factory forced to idle, staring blankly. There is an unknown amount of wasted power and suppressed vitality in this. It is really useless to simply make a slogan now. We must remove this forced idleness and start this machine again, so that people in all departments can stand at their posts and exert their effectiveness. That is to say, the countryside must be revitalized, factories must be built, and all public welfare undertakings must be promoted.</p>
<p>These are all extremely simple and obvious truths. We do not need advanced theories, nor do we need to exaggerate propaganda. It is not difficult to say, but it is difficult to do; doing is not difficult, but it is difficult for those in power to start with themselves, work hard, seek truth from facts, and establish a new atmosphere.

<h3>Incompetent Magistrate of Echeng: Treats Economic Controls as Routine, Delays Study for Over a Month</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] A certain authoritative figure here recently provided information to our reporter regarding economic controls. According to them, when they went to Echeng earlier this month, they discovered that the people of Echeng were still unaware of the economic control regulations. After repeated inquiries, it was learned that the county had received the economic control order forwarded by the commissioner's office on August 27th, but Magistrate Shi did not issue it to the various departments for "study" and implementation until September 18th. Therefore, by the end of September, the departments had not yet received this decree. Regarding this matter, someone commented: In extraordinary times, political methods can also be a powerful tool for solving economic problems. If all towns and major cities could implement controls simultaneously, the economic situation would certainly improve significantly. However, the county magistrate delayed reviewing the emergency order for over twenty days and routinely passed it on to the various departments for study, resulting in non-implementation for over a month. This demonstrates the incompetence and perfunctoriness of local administrative officials, which is a major obstacle to the success of economic controls.</p>

<h3>Security Council Discusses Berlin Incident: Three Powers Reaffirm Firm Stance: Refuse to Discuss German Issue Until Blockade is Lifted</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] Paris, 19th Radio: The Security Council met in the afternoon of the 19th. Although Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky looked frail, he still attended the meeting. British representative Jebb spoke first on behalf of the Western powers, attacking the Soviet Union for intensifying the Berlin blockade. Vyshinsky coughed and sneezed frequently, interrupting Jebb's speech. Acting Chairman Parodi asked Jebb to provide details on the teaching and other relevant matters. Jebb immediately replied that the Soviet Union's various restrictions still existed, and any plan, its draft and implementation, under the pressure of the continuing blockade will inevitably suffer the same fate. Jebb hoped that the Security Council would accept the Western view that negotiations cannot proceed under the threat of a blockade. He said that the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council has reached a critical juncture.</p>
<p>At the same time, British representative Alexander made a statement that the Western three powers now have a feeling that it is impossible to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union even based on the agreement reached with Stalin on August 30. At that time, the Western powers had accepted in principle the Soviet mark as the sole currency of Berlin as a condition for lifting the blockade, but this agreement was later cancelled during the Berlin negotiations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] The Western three powers formally notified the Security Council on the 19th that they are unwilling to discuss any German issues with the Soviet Union until the Berlin blockade is lifted. The three powers also emphasized that the Berlin blockade is the only reason for obstructing the four powers from resuming negotiations on any or all German issues. When the Security Council began debating the Berlin issue, British representative Jebb, on behalf of the three powers, reaffirmed the firm stance of the three powers in the Berlin crisis. He answered the first of the two questions raised by the Security Council last week. U.S. representative Jessup will answer the second question later. The question answered by Jebb was: Regarding the details of the establishment of the blockade and the current situation, he presented a lengthy formal reply and accompanying documents, but only briefly explained the position of the Western countries. He warned the Security Council that the only issue raised by the Western countries in the Security Council is the Soviet Union's illegal blockade of Berlin. This matter is not only about resolving an acute dispute, but also related to the credibility of the United Nations. Referring to the Soviet Union's unilateral establishment of the blockade, Jebb said that this is a coercive attempt to prevent the other three occupying countries from exercising their legitimate rights. He then pointed out that the blockade has continued for over a month, which clearly violates the United Nations' provision that member states must not use force to achieve political purposes. Finally, he stated that "the fact is very clear that the continuation of the blockade is the only reason for preventing the four powers from negotiating."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] The Soviet Union released its white paper on the Berlin issue at the United Nations meeting on the 19th. The document did not include a commentary on the historical documents presented by the Soviet Union in the negotiations to lift the Berlin blockade. The first text of the book is a note from the Soviet Union to the three powers on February 13, protesting the three powers' plan to establish a West German government. It is understood that the reason why the Soviet Union chose this text as the first article is to point out that the Soviet Union believes that the delicate Berlin crisis began at this time, not when the blockade was implemented.</p>
<h3>Israeli Army Advances on Gaza City: Security Council Orders Ceasefire: Proposes Three Conditions for Future Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] The United Nations Security Council ordered both Arab and Jewish sides to immediately cease the fighting in Negev on the 19th. After receiving reports from United Nations officials that two ceasefire requests had been rejected, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution ordering both Arab and Jewish sides to "immediately and effectively cease hostilities in the Negev region." United Nations Acting Mediator for Palestine, Ralph Bunche, participated in the debate for the third time, refuting the implication by the Syrian representative, El-Khouri, that the Arab side was fully complying with the truce while the Jewish side was not. Bunche said, "Both sides should bear the responsibility for disrupting the truce." Bunche reported to the Security Council that Egypt had accepted the new Palestinian truce, but Israel's reply was effectively a rejection, received on the evening of the 18th.</p>
<p>He said that he had notified the warring parties on the 17th by submarine telegram of the order to accept an immediate and unconditional four-day truce. Egypt stated that it would accept a truce if Israel accepted it, but Israel only proposed negotiating with Egypt to peacefully resolve the Negev dispute, ignoring the request for a truce.</p>
<p>The ceasefire order of the 19th is the Security Council's third main resolution on the Palestinian issue. During the voting, the Soviet Union refused to vote on Bunche's proposal to determine the conditions for future negotiations on the Negev issue because the Security Council had not yet discussed it. The only important matter at present is to issue a ceasefire order. The Security Council's proposed conditions for negotiation are as follows: (1) Both Arab and Jewish sides withdraw their troops from the territory recently occupied during the conflict in Negev. (2) Both sides accept the protective orders of the United Nations Truce Supervision Commission. (3) Both sides agree to resolve the main issues of Negev through United Nations mediators or direct negotiations, and allow United Nations observers to be permanently stationed in the area.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Amman, 19th] According to reports from Arabs who have fled from that retreat, Jewish planes and artillery have heavily bombed Gaza, causing severe damage. The city has been captured by the Jewish army today, but there has been no official announcement to confirm this news.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Negev, 19th] Israeli troops have advanced to within five miles of Gaza, and Egyptian strongholds are under Jewish artillery fire. The Jews have broken through the Egyptian front line fifteen miles from Majdal and Bureij from the north-east towards Gaza. It is claimed that the main force of Jewish troops who had rushed into the Shahan area of southern Negev has already crossed the Fallujah front and has already encircled the wings of the Egyptian vanguard.</p>

<h3>Old ID Photos Still Usable on New IDs / Full Household Must Be Present During Census and ID Replacement / Those Without IDs Should Prepare Photos and Pre-Fill Applications</h3>
<p>Regarding the measures for the periodic census and issuance of new national identity cards (these new national identity cards have punch cards) in this city, according to Director Xiao Song of the Civil Affairs Bureau: The detailed measures for this census have been decided as follows: (1) The new national identity card with purchase voucher and index card will be enthusiastically printed by the municipal government, and will be transferred to each district and distributed to each Jia (neighborhood unit). Three days before the census, all will be issued to each household, for citizens to fill out according to the format (copied from the old card) and affix a photo (photos from old cards are allowed to be cut and pasted onto the new card), along with the labor costs, old identity card and index card stored in the household. During the census, all members of the household must be gathered inside, remain stationary, and census takers will check each household and individual. The new identity cards will be collected, and after verifying that they match the household registration book for each Jia, the photo on the newly issued national identity card will be stamped with a line mark on the spot, and given to the recipient by name for safekeeping. All collected items will be filled out on a census taker's report form and submitted to the Bao office. All old national identity cards, regardless of which province or city issued them, must be collected. Those holding identity cards from other provinces or cities must first fill out an application for a new national identity card, affixing two additional photos, to be used for household registration verification. (2) The new national identity card should be filled out based on the actual population present during the census, one for each person, and should not be duplicated or filled out incorrectly. For those actually present who do not yet have an identity card, an application for a national identity card must be filled out in advance, with two additional photos affixed. If household registration has not yet been applied for, an application for household registration must be filled out first and submitted to the census taker, Citizens must complete all these applications on their own in advance, and should not fill them out at the last minute, so as not to affect the smooth progress of the census work. Each Jia leader should inquire and issue the various application forms when distributing the new national identity cards, to avoid being unable to handle them at the last minute. (3) The census will be conducted with the autonomous region as the census guidance area, with several supervisors. Each Jia will be the basic unit of the census, with two census takers per Jia. For larger households, such as factories, schools, hotels, and government dormitories, in addition to the census takers, the factory managers, union officials, school authorities, student associations, hotel managers, and personnel supervisors of government agencies should all be present at the time to assist in the process, in order to expedite matters and avoid errors. (4) When the census is implemented, traffic control should be implemented throughout the city. Detailed measures will be formulated separately. Director Zhang also solemnly reminded the citizens: Based on the above regulations, citizens who have already obtained a national identity card do not need to take photos again. Just cut out the old photo and paste it on the new card. Those who have not previously obtained an identity card must take three 1.5-inch photos and affix them to the new identity card and application form before the new card is issued, otherwise they will not be able to receive the new card.</p>
<h3>Adapting to Actual Needs / Citizens Can Purchase Five Sheng of Rice with ID Cards Starting Today</h3>
<p>Rice merchants association representatives went to the Social Bureau yesterday afternoon to ask Director Wu to stop scalpers from buying up rice. Director Wu often agreed to the restriction on purchases and asked the Social Bureau to notify the rice merchants association. The original text is as follows: "The source of food for the citizens of this city is being actively dredged, but in view of the fact that citizens who do not understand the real situation still inevitably purchase without restrictions, it is inevitably inappropriate. Based on the actual need for rice in this month, two dou per person is calculated. In addition to the one dou of rice allocated per capita, one dou must also be purchased on the market. However, since there is only one sentence left until the end of the month, the actual need is only three and a half sheng. From now until the end of this month, it is temporarily decided that each person can purchase five sheng of rice at a time with a national identity card, and an impression will be stamped on the card to prevent crowding."</p>

<h3>Striving to Solve the Meat Shortage / Establishing a Joint Office / Collectively Purchasing Pigs for the Market / Prohibiting Restaurants from Over-Purchasing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Economic Supervision Office is determined to solve the pork supply in this city in a unified way. At 4 p.m. yesterday, Secretary Cai Bairi, accompanied by Captain Cheng Yikuan, was ordered to summon eight representatives of the fresh pork industry in this city, Hong Wengao, Qin Qiankang of the pig industry, and Zhu Zhigao, Zhang Wubin, Fang Yongxiang, Gu Guanfu, Wu Hesheng, and Wang Weixia of the pork industry, for detailed discussions. It was decided to form a joint office of the pork industry in this city in the shortest possible time. The measures have been drafted by the meat merchants and submitted for approval, and the candidates can also be nominated soon. It is expected that the work can be promoted within two days. The function of the joint office is to gather all the forces of the pork wholesalers and purchasers in this city to purchase a large number of piglets from northern Jiangsu to meet the needs of citizens. In order to adapt to the actual market situation, it is also planned to exchange barley for pigs. After the piglets are transported to Shanghai, they will be registered and distributed, with 15% supplied to the restaurant industry and the remainder supplied to ordinary citizens. The restaurant industry must not over-purchase fresh meat at prices higher than the limited prices, otherwise they will be severely punished. According to the meat merchants, the recent shortage of pork is mainly due to the unsmooth source. In the past, the highest number of fresh pigs transported to Shanghai from other ports reached as many as 5,000 pigs per day, but currently it is only 1,000 pairs per day. Meat is different from other commodities, so there is no inventory. To ensure that this city has a sufficient supply of pork in the long term, it is first necessary to suppress the selling price of live pigs in various places.</p>

<h3>Public Buses Delayed Due to Employee Demands for Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>The municipal public transportation company has recently been adjusted due to the retirement of internal personnel, but the external employees remain the same, which has caused dissatisfaction. This morning, routes 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 15 were delayed until 9 a.m. to leave the factory. It was found that the first bus was originally scheduled to depart at 6:20 a.m. In order to fight for the treatment issue, the external employees persisted with the company authorities until 8:45 a.m., when Director Wang and Deputy Director Ding negotiated with the union representatives and reached a result.

<h3>Coal Briquettes at Retail Stores / Demand Exceeds Supply / Limited to One Dan Per Person / Factories Rely on Inventory to Maintain</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the midst of material shortages, coal briquettes, a daily necessity, are also difficult to purchase. Major coal briquette companies used to be able to deliver by phone, but recently, due to too many panic buyers, they have canceled the delivery method. Customers must go to the retail store to pick up the goods, limited to one dan per person. Currently, large companies such as Yitaixing and Guohua are working day and night, with a daily output of about 30,000 dan. Among them, after removing coal briquettes allocated to public officials, educators, etc., about 100 dan are distributed to each retail store per day. This number was usually sufficient, but recently, due to the psychological panic of the general public, even if there is surplus coal at home, they will still come to buy it, resulting in demand exceeding supply. The limited price of coal briquettes on August 19 was 3.33 yuan per dan, while the cost of raw coal was approximately 10 million legal tender per dan. Currently, the cost of transporting coal from Hankou to Shanghai is approximately 5.5 yuan in gold coins per dan. Coal briquette factories are currently relying on inventory to maintain operations. After the inventory of coal is used up, if the price cannot be adjusted, the quality of coal briquettes will be greatly reduced.</p>

<h3>Gasoline Saving Committee Holds Subgroup Meeting to Discuss Principles to Be Submitted to the Mayor for Approval</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Relevant departments of the Municipal Government held a gasoline saving review subgroup committee meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday in the office of Municipal Counselor Wang Guanqing to discuss the method for allocating gasoline in this city after the gasoline quota was sharply reduced. It is learned that the gasoline shortage has reached its most serious point.

In addition to the 400-odd vehicles used by doctors, there are also about 100 vehicles that have passed special applications. The remainder can only be used to supply dozens of vehicles.

However, according to the declaration of all directors and supervisors of the Sugar Industry Association and hundreds of sugar merchants in the industry, the sugar merchants under the association were originally engaged in wholesale business, not retail stores, and the external black market was caused by scalpers reselling for profit, which had no direct relationship with the sugar merchants. The sugar merchants also expressed their willingness to register and entrust the existing sugar for storage, and to supply it as much as possible, which has also been reported to the Social Bureau for record. The industry publicly appointed representatives to make a statement to the supervising director's office yesterday, and submitted a statement to the Special Criminal Court in the afternoon to apply for bail first, and to wait for a fair investigation. Therefore, Zheng and Zhu were interrogated by the prosecutors of the Special Criminal Court and were granted bail at 5 p.m. yesterday.</p>

<h3>Sauce and Liquor Industry Requests Allocation of Cooking Oil, Will Negotiate for Supply and Door-to-Door Sales</h3>
<p>The second batch of 7,500 dan of oil supplied to the Shanghai Medical Association has reportedly been stipulated by the authorities to be allocated by the Oil Merchants Association to the Association for distribution to its members for door-to-door sales. The Association will negotiate for the allocation. In addition, a person in charge of the Association stated: "The report that oil wholesalers requested that cooking oil not be allocated to the sauce and liquor industry shows a feudal mindset and is not in line with the times. The members of the Sauce and Liquor Association are all guaranteed cooking oil retailers, and there are more than 2,000 of them throughout the city. Citizens rely on them to buy cooking oil. The request of the wholesale oil merchants not to allocate any oil is contrary to the intentions of the authorities' emergency instructions and is absolutely impossible."</p>
<h3>Bread, Biscuits, and Pastries Sales Unprecedentedly Booming, Raw Material Shortages Affect Production, Survey Needs to Be Compiled and Submitted for Unified Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the bread, biscuit, and pastry industry in this city: in recent months, due to the unprecedentedly booming sales of products and the difficulty in replenishing raw materials, most factories have fallen into a state of semi-shutdown. The industry needs large quantities of flour, sugar, and diesel, all of which are currently impossible to purchase in sufficient quantities. Because the flour mills in this city have to supply the China Trust Bureau for storage every month, the industry can only rely on the quotas approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Last week, the industry received 6,000 bags of flour, all of which were third- and fourth-class coarse flour. Each factory could only be allocated one shi of flour. In terms of quality, it was impossible to manufacture better biscuits and pastries. In terms of quantity, the products made within a week were often sold out within two days. For example, Guanshengyuan used to need 150 bags of flour every day, but now it has been reduced to 30 bags. The products that used to be enough for ten hours of business every day are now sold out in less than one and a half hours. At present, the general public seems to be very interested in scrambling for food. According to the statistical report of Guanshengyuan, the preserved fruits, chili sauce, olives, figs, pepper powder, etc. made by the store are all snapped up every day, and the purpose of these buyers seems to be to engage in single-handed transportation to other places for profit. The store believes that the quality of the puffed biscuits is the best and can only be preserved for five or six months at most, but currently, due to various conditions, the quality has been greatly reduced. Rushing to buy and hoarding will only lead to spoilage, so citizens do not need to buy and store large quantities. The industry is now aware that the raw material inventory of each factory is limited, and most can only last for one or two months. For example, the inventory of the largest-scale Sullivan factory will also be used up by the end of this month, so it has started to conduct a general survey to determine the actual quantity needed by each factory every month and request the authorities to find ways to make unified allocation to overcome the difficulties. In addition to flour, sugar, soda, lard, and peanut oil, which are impossible to purchase, diesel, an important fuel, has also been suspended for allocation since August, so it will also apply for allocation. In addition, the glass bottles, caps, and wrapping paper used by the industry for packaging are too expensive. In order to comply with the price limit, it has been decided not to use them in the future. As for the tinplate used for making packaging cans, the price has risen three times compared to before August 19, so the industry has also decided that the existing canned goods will only be sold until they are sold out, and it does not intend to order new cans.</p>
<h3>Diamond Charity Lottery, Draw to Be Held on Schedule</h3>

<h3>Compensation Machinery Distributed at Discount Prices, Will Continue to Be Handled in the Future</h3>
<p>Xian Baochang, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, told reporters today: "The method of distributing Japanese compensation machinery to private enterprises at 25% of the price will not be canceled because the first batch of price distribution work is about to be completed. This method will continue to be effective in the future." Mr. Gu said: "More than 2,000 pieces of machinery have been distributed at a discount in the first batch of compensation machinery. A total of 90 manufacturers have applied to purchase them and have already signed contracts and are paying and picking up the goods, accounting for two-thirds. The processing of the first batch of materials will be completed soon. For the second batch of compensation materials, our country can get about 140,000 pieces of machinery. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they will still be distributed to private industries according to the past ratio."</p>
<h3>Simplified Collection of Business Tax, Application to Participate by Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "Key Implementation Measures for Simplifying the Collection of Business Tax" and the "Organizational Regulations of the Review Committee" have been formulated and announced by the Municipal Government. The Finance Bureau specially held a meeting a few days ago and decided to convert the tax amounts for the four seasons of autumn and winter of the 36th year and spring and summer of the 37th year according to the regulations, average them, and discount them into gold yuan, which will be the tax base for this season. Taxes will be calculated based on this base first, regardless of whether to participate in the simplification or not. Applications to participate in the procedures must be submitted before November 15. Those who do not participate will have their accounts strictly checked, and then the tax amount will be determined. This time, because merchants could not fill in the tax amount themselves, they are required to follow the regulations strictly within ten days after receiving the tax amount notice. Those who fail to do so will be punished, and the regulations will be implemented in the next quarter. The Bureau has also studied the tax calculation technology and simplified it, and will issue a formula separately. This time, the base is based on facts to make general regulations. If there are a few cases that need to be adjusted, the relevant industry association has the right to assist the Finance Bureau in making appropriate adjustments to the base for the entire industry. After that, merchants participating in the simplification will save a lot of trouble after paying taxes in accordance with the regulations.</p>

According to Deputy Director Xie: According to the analysis of various situations, the driving speed at the time of the accident did not exceed 65 kilometers per hour, so the driving speed was definitely not the cause of the derailment. A review of the steel rails also shows that they were newly replaced, and the distance from the accident site to the stopping point is only 120 meters (the police braking is about 300 to 350 meters), which is also enough to prove that the driver is skilled and his actions are very agile.</p>
<p>The Timetable Will Be Rearranged</p>
<p>The Flying Train still runs as usual, but the last two ordinary first-class cars are replaced. It is said that the driving speed is still not affected. Today, the train will be completely replaced with ordinary passenger cars, and the driving time and fares will remain the same. The streamlined car will be sent to the factory for repairs, and it will be able to restore its original appearance around the first of next month. Deputy Director Xie also said: After the streamlined car is repaired and running, it will shorten the travel time to four and a half hours for the entire Beijing-Shanghai journey. At that time, the entire driving schedule will also be rearranged.</p>
<h3>Naked Man Killed in Collision</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai rescue car was traveling, it hit a naked man at 8 kilometers from Shanghai (near Zhenru). After investigation, the night road worker discovered it at 12:00 midnight and immediately sent him to the railway hospital for treatment. The man's head was broken, and his right toe was crushed. He died yesterday morning due to excessive blood loss.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to the Railway Bureau's investigation of the incident, the deceased was named Xiao Peiyu, 38 years old, and lived in the Liujiazhai, Yangjiaqiao, Zhenru. He had been unemployed for a long time and was very poor. On the 18th night, because the cloth he was wearing was torn in the front and back, he took it off and asked his wife to mend it. They chatted casually, and suddenly, they quarreled and fought with his sister-in-law Xiao Xi. In a fit of anger, he ran out of the house without considering that his lower body was naked. It was tragic that he died in such a state.</p>

<h3>Application for Importing Goods for Which Payment Has Been Made, the Review Committee Relaxes the Standards, Production Equipment and Finished Products Can Be Applied for Import</h3>
<p>The Review Committee for Overseas Chinese Investment and Foreign Exchange and Foreign Currency Deposits to Apply for Import has been formally established. In the future, applications for import of overseas Chinese investment and goods for which payment has been made will be handled by the Committee. It is reported that the standards for applying for import of goods for which payment has been made are very broad. Production equipment in Schedule (1), industrial raw materials in Schedule (2), and parts and finished products in Schedule (3) A and B can be applied for import. According to officials, the expansion of the import scope this time is to strive for a large amount of foreign materials to be imported to solve the domestic demand for raw materials. The Import Control Commission also stated yesterday that the Committee will handle these cases in an extremely efficient manner and will never delay them. Yesterday, the Committee had contacted Nanjing, and it is expected that the order will arrive here today.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit Situation Worsens, Cash Panic Is Common</h3>
<p>The tight credit situation worsened yesterday. Market interest rates rose to more than 20 cents, with the highest reaching 27 cents. Businesses inside and outside the industry need cash and feel panic. However, the difficulty of turnover is extremely great, even worse than the day before. According to financial experts, this difficult situation will inevitably intensify around the weekend. Banks are generally short of cash due to customers rushing to withdraw deposits, and the authorities are trying to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>Recent Statistics on the Purchase of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies in the Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The amount of purchases by the National Bank of Shanghai and its entrusted banks and bureaus from August 23 to October 16 is as follows:</p>
<p>Gold 1,145,977.135 taels</p>
<p>Silver 964,520.126 taels</p>
<p>Silver dollars 3,681,716.50 yuan</p>
<p>Silver dimes 3,877,527 dimes</p>
<p>US dollars 34,490,250.42 yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong dollars 10,891,017.37 yuan</p>
<p>Philippine pesos 14,793,793.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wool Textile Factory Plans to Exchange Products for Raw Materials</h3>
<p>According to the wool textile industry, the equipment of wool textile factories nationwide is as follows: (1) 62,400 fine wool spindles, (2) 22,744 woolen yarn spindles, (3) 12,756 coarse ring spindles, (4) 29,541 coarse roving spindles, (5) 2,003 looms.</p>
<p>Among them, the Shanghai area has the most wool textile industry equipment: (1) 61,772 wool spindles, 21,064 of which are in operation, accounting for about 50%. (2) 14,036 woolen yarn spindles, 8,271 of which are in operation, accounting for about 58%. (3) 6,756 coarse ring spindles, 6,417 of which are in operation, accounting for about 94%. (4) 16,266 coarse roving spindles, 14,976 of which are in operation, accounting for about 92%. (5) 1,627 looms, 973 of which are in operation, accounting for about 59%. According to people in the industry, the reason why so few are in operation is due to a lack of raw materials. In the past, wool relied purely on imports, and part of it was purchased from the north. Recently, imports have been difficult, and the import quota for the seventh phase of wool has been canceled. Due to the situation in the north, it is impossible to purchase wool, and the current raw materials stored in Shanghai account for less than 20% of the required amount. Now that the wool textile industry's domestic wool fabrics and woolen yarn have reached world standards, it is planned to request the authorities to imitate the export methods of cotton textiles, export domestic wool textile products, and exchange them for wool imports to aid production.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Implements Joint Purchase, Stopping Factories from Freely Purchasing</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee held its sixth committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Liu Gongyun, and discussed and resolved the following major issues: (1) In addition to the 17 members who have already been hired, Shou Miancheng, General Manager of the Central Cooperative Bank, was hired as a member. (2) After the Executive Yuan announced the National Cotton Joint Purchase Method on the 16th, all factories should stop freely purchasing. Therefore, the request from factories in Hankou, due to a shortage of raw materials, to allow them to purchase on their own first was not approved, and a telegram was immediately sent to stop them. (5) The US General Assembly divided the recommendation that the yarn and cloth exchanged for US aid cotton should be allowed to flow into the countryside to exchange for cotton for domestic sales. The committee agreed to the suggestion and decided to mark the yarn and cloth for cash sales to the countryside to purchase cotton. (4) The committee will consider collecting finished products from each yarn factory for duplication cases to exchange for cotton or allocate them to the people for daily use.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Distributed as Usual</h3>
<p>The Textile Construction Company distributed goods as usual yesterday, but the types were extremely scarce. Only 12-pound trumpet B fine cloth, priced at 24 yuan (limited to retail stores), was offered for application. Auxiliary brand 28.5-yard serge, priced at 23.5 yuan (limited to dyeing factories), was offered for purchase. Jinyun Miaowu yuan serge, priced at 27.6 yuan per bolt (limited to retail stores), was offered for application. Hai Che white poplin, priced at 27 yuan per bolt (limited to underwear industry), was offered for purchase. Other colored goods were not included in the distribution, but there was another 002-B20 US colored cloth, which was popular.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the third phase of the second batch distribution for the dyeing and weaving industry, it was originally scheduled to hold application procedures at the Cotton Cloth Association market at 1:00 pm the day before yesterday. However, because the amount of goods was small and the distribution technology still needed to be improved, it was postponed until 10:00 am yesterday, when the Association convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the matter. It is reported that the main issue was the wholesale merchants' request to continue to distribute the weaving, and the result was a decision to distribute as usual. As for this period's distribution, the industry's purchase procedures will be handled starting at 1:00 pm. It is estimated that more than 15,000 bolts of bed sheet cloth will be distributed in full.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Dull and Soft</h3>
<p>Since the Joint Purchase Committee announced the price of raw cotton, there have been no transactions among the industry, and the asking price in the production areas is higher than that in Shanghai. Cotton merchants' business has come to a standstill, and some households seem to have the intention to sell out.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Bill Discounting</h3>
<p>The Gold Control Bureau ordered immediate implementation</p>
<p>[Tai Bao News] The Gold Control Bureau recently issued an order from the Ministry of Finance to immediately stop all silver money banks and trust companies from charging customers for bill discounting. The Bureau has issued the order to the Shanghai Silver Money Trust Industry Association for all member banks and companies to comply.</p>
<h3>Slightly Reduced Arrivals Due to Rain; Rice Market Transactions Remain Sparse</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals continued steadily. Yesterday, due to rain, arrivals were slightly less than the previous day. However, market transactions still showed no improvement. Most of the arrivals were distributed to a small number of rice shops, and the majority of rice shops still had no rice to purchase. Prices remained unchanged at the original levels. Yesterday's rice arrivals: Nanshi rice market and rice factories accounted for 974 piculs and one dou. Rice firms accounted for 42 piculs, Beishi rice firms accounted for 172 piculs, rice firms accounted for 167 piculs, factories accounted for 722 piculs, and outside businesses handled 50 piculs of rice independently, totaling 3,070 piculs for the two markets.</p>
<p>Flour remained unopened. In the coarse grain market, 50 packages of Jiujiang winter soybeans were traded at a price of 14 yuan and 6 jiao. Approximately 400 packages of customs-cleared raw peanuts for extraction and general merchandise were opened. Other corns, barley, and red grains were uniformly unopened.</p>
<p>Due to scarce purchases and sales in the Yangzhuang tea market this week, the process has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday's market was even more sluggish, but holders still firmly believe that production and inventory are both dry. The market sentiment remained steady as before, and the market atmosphere was still strong. Regarding Hong Kong export merchants' black tea, British demand is still urgent, so as soon as the weather clears, they plan to negotiate with sellers. As for domestic tea, buying interest from Chongqing and other regions is not obvious. As for Su, Xi, Chang, and other places, there are still inquiries, but unfortunately, the supply of old tea is not much, and transactions are narrow, so prices are remarkably high.</p>
<h3>Silk Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The silk market situation continued to be sluggish, and transactions were deserted. Silk firms had more people inquiring for purchases and fewer people supplying. The public association allocated 35 small packages yesterday. It was heard that there were negotiations for raw silk exports yesterday, but no transaction was completed due to unmet prices. The inventory of domestic silk firms is very thin, and factories are also selling less. People are keen for profits, and most holders are watching the market. No transactions were heard.</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty in purchasing raw materials, finished products from silk and satin weaving businesses have become increasingly scarce. The inventories of various shops are still abundant, but many are unwilling to sell old stocks under price limits. There are no wholesale transactions in the market. Since purchasing with vouchers, sales at silk shops have become slightly less active, and most of the displayed colors are unpopular goods, so business has not been as prosperous recently as it was during the previous rush.</p>
<h3>"First Edition" and "Second Edition" Subsidiary Coins Are Not Distinguishable in Circulation - Answer from the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank -</h3>
<p>We have received your letter number 37191, dated October 9, along with three points of inquiry from Mr. Jiang Zongcan regarding the use of various coins, as well as questions about how to distinguish between "first edition" and "second edition" coins, and we have been asked to answer them all. Our replies are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Jiang asks: "Are the one-fen and five-fen aluminum coins the aluminum coins minted in 1940?" Answer: "Yes." (2) Asks: "Can these aluminum coins be used for circulation at face value?" Answer: "Yes." (3) Asks: "Can the one-fen copper coin of 1937 be circulated?" Answer: "One-fen copper coins were minted successively in 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1940. Regardless of size, they are all legal tender. As for 'First Edition' and 'Second Edition,' these are related to weight and are for the bank's internal accounting purposes. There is no distinction in their circulation." We hereby reply to your letter and request that you forward it for your review or publish the answers in your esteemed column for public awareness, for which we would be most grateful. Addressed to the Social Services Department of Shen Bao. Central Bank Issuing Bureau, October 15.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee Approves Scholarship Quotas for This Year; Allocation Quotas for Each School to Be Decided by Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee met yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the fifth floor of the Shen Bao building to determine the scholarship quotas for students in various levels of schools for the first semester of the 1948 academic year, as well as the scholarship amount for each recipient. The total amount of scholarships is 150,000 gold yuan, and the scholarships will be awarded to 12,300 students. The allocation quotas for each school are to be decided by the committee at a review meeting.</p>
<p>Those present at yesterday's meeting included Chairman and Vice-Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Li Ximou, and representatives from various organizations. Chairman Pan first reported that the handling of scholarships this time was extremely strict. All schools whose free student quotas were not yet met were rejected when applying. When schools submit their applications, they must also report the total number of students in the school for the purpose of calculating the allocation ratio. Those who overreport will be dealt with by the meeting.</p>
<p>Number of Applications from Each School:</p>
<p>(1) Public colleges and universities applied for scholarships for a total of 1,393 students. (2) Private colleges and universities applied for scholarships for a total of 2,061 students. Among them, Daxia University has not yet submitted its application, and the free student quota for Guanghua University has not been met. (3) Public middle schools applied for scholarships for a total of 1,123 students. Among them, Gezhi Middle School and Tongji Affiliated Middle School did not report the total number of students. (4) Private middle schools applied for scholarships for a total of 1,705 students. Among them, 34 schools, including Minzhi and Zhengshi, did not submit a list of free students. 13 schools, including Guangcheng Pharmaceutical Vocational School and Xihua, did not meet their free student quotas. (5) Private primary schools applied for scholarships for a total of 3,558 students. Among them, Wenchang and Shanghai West Second School did not report the number of students. 16 schools, including Peimeng and Jiyang, did not meet their free student quotas. Chairman Pan believes that since school has already started for a long time, the distribution of scholarships cannot be delayed any longer. He hopes to conclude the work as soon as possible and allocate the funds that have already been raised first. If more donations are received later, another meeting can be held to review and distribute them. Subsequently, Secretary-General Zheng Jie reported that the committee had received a total of 100,636 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen in scholarships entrusted to it for distribution, along with funds directly distributed by donating organizations and pledged but not yet delivered, totaling approximately 150,000 yuan. The attendees discussed and determined the scholarship quotas for students at various levels of schools based on this 150,000 yuan, as well as the scholarship amount for each recipient, as follows:</p>
<p>Scholarship Quotas and Amounts: (1) Public colleges and universities: 600 students at 20 yuan per student, 300 students at 30 yuan per student. (2) Private colleges and universities: 1,000 students at 30 yuan per student, 300 students at 40 yuan per student, 300 students at 60 yuan per student. (3) Public middle schools: 800 students at 10 yuan per student. (4) Private middle schools: 800 students at 15 yuan per student, 400 students at 20 yuan per student, 300 students at 25 yuan per student. (5) Municipal suburban national schools: 5,000 students at 1 yuan per student. (6) Private primary schools: 1,800 students at 10 yuan per student, 700 students at 15 yuan per student.</p>
<p>Other Resolutions: Other resolutions were as follows: (1) Schools that overreport the total number of students will have their scholarships issued based on the actual number of students recorded by the Bureau of Education, and the Bureau of Education will punish the principals of those schools. (2) Schools that do not submit a list of free students will still be reviewed as usual. Qualified applicants will be notified to apply for free tuition from their schools. After the school's free quota is met, the meeting will review and issue scholarships. (3) Each school should submit the academic and conduct grades of scholarship recipients at the end of the semester for evaluation.</p>
<p>Vice-Chairman Li suggested at yesterday's meeting that, starting next semester, middle school and college students receiving scholarships should be required to fulfill some obligations, which will take the form of work-study. Attendees generally agreed with this principle.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao's Scholarship Procedures</h3>
<p>The procedures for issuing Shen Bao scholarships are the same as those for the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, and each school must first submit a list of free students. Recently, some students from schools have inquired about the delay in issuing scholarships, thinking that they have been delayed. In fact, this is due to a lack of understanding of the procedures. We hope to urge the schools to submit the lists of names so that the work can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The Ministry of Education has recently abolished the list of foreign colleges and universities by ministerial order. This list was previously compiled based on surveys conducted abroad as a reference for guiding students studying abroad to enter foreign schools. The situation has changed since the war, and it is no longer convenient to use it as the basis for reviewing the qualifications of students studying abroad, so it has been expressly abolished. Although the current status of colleges and universities in Europe and the United States has been surveyed, there is no statistical list yet.</p>

The third Mayor's Cup will also be held at that time. The League Handbook will be published soon, and teams will be notified to come to the meeting to collect it.</p>

<h3>Official Salary</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lank</p>
<p>Since ancient times, being an official has been about serving the people, and although the goal is definitely not to get rich, at the very least, one must be able to solve the problem of eating. Therefore, the term "official salary," as the name suggests, simply refers to the living expenses of civil servants. Besides the official salary of civil servants, other things such as "tuition fees," "iron fees," and "envelope money" may have different names, but they serve the same purpose: they must be able to meet the minimum living needs in order to be considered reasonable. If the official salary of a civil servant cannot maintain a minimum standard of living, then it will inevitably affect the efficiency of their work, and in more serious cases, it will affect the prosperity or decline of the national fortune. The actual loss to the country is so great that it cannot be compensated for by reducing some budget figures.</p>
<p>The official salaries of past dynasties, as recorded in historical books, show that the official salaries of prosperous dynasties were generally higher than those of declining dynasties. In the Han Dynasty, after Emperor Gaozu ascended the throne and unified the world, the salaries of the Three Dukes of the Chancellor were 10,000 shi, the Lieutenant General was 2,000 shi, the Chancellor's Chief Secretary was 1,000 shi, the Court Commandant was 1,000 shi, and the County Magistrate was 600 shi to 300 shi. According to the Han scholar Gu's commentary, the so-called 10,000 shi actually represented 350 hu of grain per month, 2,000 shi was 100 hu, 1,000 shi was 90 hu, 500 shi was 77 hu, and 300 shi was 40 hu. Since the Song Dynasty, five dou were equal to one hu, but in the Han Dynasty, ten dou were equal to one hu, so even the lowest-ranking seventh-grade official had a monthly salary of 40 shi of rice.</p>
<p>After the Five Barbarian Invasions, which brought prolonged chaos, such as in the early years of the Later Wei Dynasty, there was actually no official salary system, so honest officials were extremely poor. The biography of Gao Yun in the History of the Northern Dynasties says: "Gao Yun had only a few thatched huts and wore patched robes. His house contained only salted vegetables, and he always ordered his sons to collect firewood for self-sufficiency." To be an official and be so poor was no better, if not worse, than the poor civil servants of today. The general officials of the time obtained their livelihoods from the wealthy. As long as they were good at cultivating relationships, they could do as they pleased. Their methods were quite clever. It was not until the eighth year of Emperor Xiaowen's Taihe reign that the system of issuing salaries was established, with each person receiving two bolts of silk and 2.9 hu of rice. The meager amount was incomparable to that of the Han Dynasty. Tao Yuanming's refusal to bend his waist for five dou of rice also occurred during that chaotic period.</p>
<p>After the chaotic period of the Five Dynasties, Zhu brought peace to the country. The official salaries of the Zhu Dynasty were: the Chancellor, the Privy Council Deputy, and the Privy Council Commissioner received 200 shi per month, the Military Commissioners of various armies received 150 shi per month, the Prefects received 50 shi per month, and the County Magistrates received 5 shi to 3 shi, with three grades. Compared to the Han Dynasty, this was still far behind.</p>
<p>The official salaries of the Yuan Dynasty were a system of mixed grain and salary. Salaries were determined by the size of the rank, and grain was determined by the complexity of the job. Salaries were higher, and grain was less. The Grand Tutor, Grand Preceptor, Grand Protector, and Left Chancellor received 15 shi per month, the Six Ministers received 8 shi per month, the Vice Ministers received 5 shi per month, and the Vice Principals to Doctors received varying amounts from 3.5 dou to 2.5 dou. This was somewhat like the current 3-dou rice ration for public school employees, but the amount was much larger than today.</p>
<p>The official salaries of the Ming Dynasty returned to a full-salary system of grain. First-grade officials received 87 shi of rice per month, from first grade to third grade the amount decreased by 13 shi to 35 shi, third-grade officials received 26 shi, sixth-grade officials received 10 shi, and seventh-grade to ninth-grade officials received varying amounts from 7.5 dou to 3 shi per month, still far less generous than the official salaries of the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>Since the Qing Dynasty, the salaries of civil servants have deteriorated with each generation, becoming worse and worse. Today, from "selected" and "special" appointees to officials, except for those with special income, the difference is only between "slightly poor" and "destitute." Recently, the official salary has been pegged to a base of 40 gold yuan, but prices have not stabilized. The tragic future of civil servants is too painful to imagine.</p>
<h3>Morbid Training Institute</h3>
<p>— Forgetting Self</p>
<p>After reading the article "The Maker of Idiots," I felt that the author wrote deeply about the current malpractices based on life experience and that it will surely win "a chorus of sighs."</p>
<p>That was an article about discussing secondary education. Here, I will talk about some practical elementary school education, although it is a matter of opinion, but it concerns the happiness of the next generation, so it seems that we cannot take it lightly.</p>
<p>I have traveled all over the elementary schools in Shanghai—excuse me for not quoting the lengthy names, because I am looking for the so-called "nationals," but I will not see adults entering school.—There are many children with pale faces or thin muscles, either congenitally deficient or poorly nourished later in life, and they have almost become annoying at home. So they are pushed to school.</p>
<p>After a series of "no credit for acquaintances" collection procedures, the school accepts the children and then performs the so-called "strict teaching and management" operation. Some even use the "emphasize the three subjects of English and mathematics" knife, and follow ancient methods. Although no one sees the process of concocting, only God knows what the intention is.</p>
<p>English is taught in the third grade, with memorizing, writing, and dictation. An eight-year-old child is forced to master a foreign language. How can he bear the heavy responsibility of the country!</p>
<p>In addition to Mandarin, there is also Chinese literature, plus measures. In addition to composition, there is also transcription, plus diary? Read a lesson, memorize a lesson, dictate a paragraph. Copy notes, check annotations. Some children write: "Bad! The place where heaven and earth are sacrificed." "Shui! Big lake." They are either inexplicable or vaguely understandable. Fortunately, they are not required to understand them thoroughly. They can just copy the same thing during the exam, not changing a single word, and they are considered good students.</p>
<p>In mathematics, there are written arithmetic, abacus, and supplementary difficult problems that jump over one or two years. There is no teaching of quick calculation skills here. Instead, there are countless difficult problems to make things difficult. Therefore, children's bodies and minds are dull. Schools are "serious" in the end.</p>
<p>Once a school has a "reputation," it is not afraid of being "full." There are narrow side rooms where nearly a hundred people are squeezed together. Some parents who are good at arguing insist on letting their children squeeze in, even standing to listen, which is very similar to Cheng Men standing in the snow.</p>
<p>A class lasts for three quarters of an hour or even an hour, which is said to be "genuine." Eight hours a day will certainly be more "attractive."</p>
<p>There is no method in teaching. This retro style is especially evident in "famous" private schools. As a result, children's physical fitness and habits are deteriorating. How can people not be worried?</p>
<p>What a sad, morbid training institute!</p>
<h3>Names and Places</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Regarding writing, especially writing related to historical events, personal and place names are necessary components of the text. Therefore, the interpretation of personal and place names varies. For example, "My friend Hu Shi" has already been criticized and need not be discussed. Other terms like "Mr.", "Jun", "Gong", "Zhang", "Weng", "Senior", "Madam", or "My Friend" are used depending on the relationship between the author and the subject and don't matter much. However, I advocate calling people by their given names directly, or first writing their style name, with the given name in parentheses, such as "Xu Jilong (Shi)". Afterwards, refer to them only as Jilong or Xu. If I have no relationship with them, for the sake of clarity and ease of recognition for the reader, I write their names directly, such as Xu Shichang, Zhao Erxun, Wang Yiyun, Qi Xieyuan, etc.</p>
<p>Currently, some people refer to officials of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, those who passed the imperial examinations, or bureaucrats from the Republican warlord era using terms like "Qing Bi", "Ke Jia", or their ancestral home, instead of writing their names directly. This kind of habit is a remnant of feudalism, such as Jia Wenzhong Gong, Yi Wenzheng Gong, Bing Zhenghui Gong, Ding Wenxiang Gong, or Zi Zhijun, Chou Zhongcheng, Yin Taishou, Mao Daling; or Chun Dianzhuan, Xia Taishi, Qiu Xiaolian, Dong Shangshe; and Zeng Xiangxiang, Weng Changshu, Kang Nanhai, Liang Xinhui, and so on. Such titles still appeared in the Republican era, which makes the revolution seem redundant. However, one point worth noting is that revolutionary figures with outstanding achievements did not like this practice, such as Chen Shaobai, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, Chen Qimei, Song Jiaoren, etc. No one ever called them Chen Xinhui, Huang Changsha (originally from those counties, but later collectively referred to as Changsha), Hu Panyu, Chen Wuxing, Song Taoyuan. During the period under the rule of the Northern Government, there were still titles like Yuan Xiangcheng, Li Huangpi, Feng Hejian, Xu Donghai, Duan Hefei, etc. However, no one within or outside the party referred to the Chairman of the National Government, Tan Yankai, or Lin Sen, as Tan Chaling or Lin Minhou, nor were the heads of the five Yuan referred to by their ancestral homes. From this point of view, it can be seen that society viewed the officials and gentry left over from the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the bureaucrats of the Northern Government in the same way.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the collapse of the puppet state of Manchukuo, Puyi, even after he had become a so-called "emperor" in Changchun, still bestowed posthumous titles to some deceased former Qing officials, even "Wenzhong" for someone who had plotted a mutiny. At that time, Puyi was no longer the so-called "Great Qing Emperor"! Chen Shichen was not a subject of the puppet state of Manchukuo, so it is unknown on what basis Puyi posthumously named Chen "Wenzhong." This is truly a foolish person doing foolish things. And some people still follow Puyi's illegal pronouncements after the establishment of the Republic of China, which is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some writers prefer to use ancient names for place names, such as calling Nanjing Baixia or Jianye, Zhenjiang Jingkou, Guangzhou Chuting, Wuhu Fanzi, Hangzhou Renhe, etc. This is reversing the times, forcing readers to consult old dictionaries to understand. In the 37th year of the Republic of China and still using this practice, it seems to be related to the times and thought. I cannot agree with this.</p>
<h3>Spring in Autumn</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a friend told me that the crabapple blossoms in his house were blooming. (But not the autumn begonia, the so-called iron-stem crabapple, which blooms in spring.) Today, I happened to step into the backyard and saw that the peach blossoms were also budding. It is now the ninth lunar month of autumn. If viewed from the old perspective, this would be considered a disaster, perhaps something that could be recorded in the "Treatise on the Five Elements," under the category of plant anomalies. At the same time, people would sigh and lament, talking about the great principles of interaction between heaven and humans. Or some people would say that the weather has been too hot lately, causing plants to behave abnormally, which is not a big deal. The so-called tenth month is a minor spring. But unfortunately, it is still only the ninth month.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that I am not surprised by this, but rather feel infinite hope. Now is autumn, and the people of the world are filled with the autumn chill, worried about future wars. But I believe that humanity will not be so foolish as to collectively embark on a path of suicide. The solution to humanity lies in humanity itself. The blooming of peach blossoms and crabapple blossoms in autumn already indicates to us that there is a breath of spring in autumn. "Spring is not my spring, autumn is not my autumn" - only the thoroughly pessimistic would say such things. We must strive, not just wait.</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Unsung Heroes</h3>
<p>— Fei Yu</p>
<p>Hollywood's business relies on two things: stars and props.</p>
<p>Every film company has millions of dollars' worth of props of all kinds. These props are all collected by people who specialize in providing props. These people are all alert and resourceful. They are ubiquitous. As long as the director says he needs a prop, no matter how important or unimportant, they will always find a way to get it.</p>
<p>One movie scene needed a Spanish grand piano. A prop supplier managed to find one at an old lady's house, but there was no way to move it out. It turned out that a large window in the house had been sealed up after a burglary. Later, after spending a lot of money, the owner agreed to have the wall demolished. After the scene was filmed, the piano was moved back, and the wall was rebuilt. But then the director sent someone to say that the scene was not filmed well, and the piano needed to be used again.</p>
<p>Once, while a large crew was filming in the Mojave Desert, the director suddenly thought that the female lead needed a bouquet of flowers. Flowers? In a desert that hadn't seen rain in a month? But within two hours, the prop guy came with all kinds of flowers. He had stopped a train and bought them from the train.</p>
<p>Sometimes a few mosquitoes can also become a big problem. Robert Montgomery needed a few live mosquitoes in a new film, which was being shot in the dead of winter. The prop people searched every university and entomology institute, but all they could find were mosquitoes that carried malaria and yellow fever, so they couldn't be used. So they went everywhere looking for ponds with living mosquito larvae. When they found one, they brought the pond water back and put it in a greenhouse. Ten days later, Robert was filming with the mosquitoes in front of the camera.</p>
<p>In another film, the male lead had a scene where he was eating watermelon. The script was written in July, but the scene was not shot until January. So the prop people tried to preserve the watermelon. He first bought a dozen watermelons, waxed two, glued two, painted two, wrapped two in burlap, put two in the refrigerator, and put two on ice. A month later, only the two that had been frozen hard were good. But these two burst open as soon as they were exposed to room temperature and gradually turned into a soft, rotten mess. So he bought two more dozen, buried some in the ground, some in lime, and some soaked in water. A month later, they were all rotten. By then, watermelons were almost out of season, and he felt completely hopeless. He went and bought five more dozen of the best watermelons and preserved them using the different methods he knew. On the day the scene was to be shot, luckily, there was still one good one. He proudly took it to the director and told him the story of the watermelon. The screenwriter happened to be nearby and heard it.</p>
<p>"If I had known this would cause you so much trouble," the screenwriter said to him, "I would have just had the protagonist eat an apple."</p>
<p>These prop people are amazing guys, but they always hate the screenwriters and directors.</p>
<h3>Order</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Anyone with teaching experience knows that maintaining classroom order is one of the most important and difficult issues. Good classroom order is the prerequisite for excellent teaching and also a sign of excellent teaching.</p>
<p>A classroom like a temple fair, with a cacophony of voices, is truly terrible order; but if the classroom is made to resemble an ancient tomb, gloomy and silent, it is also not what is considered good order in teaching. Therefore, Banlett said, "The symbol of good order in the classroom is not silence to the point of being able to hear a pin drop, but the sound of happy labor; not tense suppression, but strong activity." Therefore, "the management of order in the classroom is not about forcing activity, but about stimulating activity; not about prohibiting something or other, but about creating something or other."</p>
<p>Generally, teachers of the old model often strive to achieve "silence to the point of being able to hear a pin drop," at the expense of "suppressing activity" and "prohibiting something or other" for students, resulting in a lifeless classroom. - New-style teachers, on the other hand, often allow everything to become indulgent in order to make the students in the room express "the sound of happy labor" or "strong activity," trying to stimulate student activity as much as possible and "creating something or other" for them, opening the door to convenience; as a result, the classroom becomes a chaotic clamor.</p>
<p>The above two methods and situations are both strictly avoided in teaching. The ideal classroom order is: on the one hand, there is the sound of happy labor, and on the other hand, it is not chaotic and noisy. Achieving this state is the most difficult thing. In general, one gains on the one hand but loses on the other, and it is rare to be able to achieve both at the same time.</p>
<p>Now, let's broaden the perspective and apply it to social order as well. Relying solely on high-pressure tactics and not allowing people to engage in free activities is called a feudal approach; complete permissiveness, which fosters the arrogance and arrogance of the people, can also be said to be a distortion of democracy; the former is true feudalism, while the latter is false democracy, neither of which is the ideal of a new China and a new society. What is the ideal? It's very simple, to have both democracy and stability. But how to build this state? The current difficulty lies precisely in this.</p>
