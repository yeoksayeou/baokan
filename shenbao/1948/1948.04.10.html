<h3>主席報告詞全文　勗勉國大代表同心戮力　掃除障礙奠立憲政始基</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕蔣主席九日上午在國民大會之報吿，原詞如下：</p>
<p>自從本届國民大會開幕以來，到今天已有十多天了。在此十多天之中，代表諸君爲國辛動，已使大會獲得許多成就，本人今天首先要代崁政府向諸君表示謝意，我們在這匪氛猖獗社會動盪的非常時期來召開國民大會，實行憲政，我想代表諸君一定都知道，這次大會召開的意義決不同於尋常的集會，而是一次非常重要的集會，我們大會的第一個任務，當然是實行憲政奠立憲政良好的始基，完成國家的建設，而我們要求國家建設完成憲政實施順利，首先就要掃除行憲的障礙，要消滅破壞國家基礎，阻礙國家建設的共匪。代表諸君受了全國同胞付託之重任，參加這次非常的大會，應該正視現實，面對敵人，共同一致，同心戮力來消滅共匪，保障憲政的實施。我相信，我們這次國民大會如能圓滿達成任務，則對於戡亂的完成，國家的安定，無異增加我們國民軍一百個師的兵力，而代表諸君對於國家民族的貢獻，在將來中國憲政史上，必將永垂不朽。</p>
<p>各位代表今天所最關切的問題，自然是國家當前的局勢，尤其是軍事和經濟的情况。在這裏我首先要說明一點，就是當此物價高漲，大多數人民生活困難的時候，而共匪又不斷的造謠，威脅，擾亂全國的人心，一般人認不淸國家的局勢，辨不出眞正的利害，於是對於民族的前途動搖了信心，對於國家的命運感到有岌岌不可終日的焦慮，其實，這完全是中了共匪宣傳的毒素，在精神上作了共匪的俘虜，正在古語所說的「相驚以伯有」輾轉吿語，自造恐慌，這正是共匪所求之不得的，我們必須從根本之處着眼，來瞭解現實的情况，衡量國家民族久遠的前途。現在我要將各位所關切的問題，就事實來說明：</p>
<p>法幣發行總額　不到七十萬億　政府所存金銀外匯及變價物資　總值七億美元抵法幣三倍有餘</p>
<p>首先　要對大家說明的，是經濟問題，自從抗戰勝利以後，由於共匪到處破壞，以致交通梗阻，工礦停頓，大多數人民生活窮困，生產委縮，而形成經濟失調的現象，這是一個事實，而且我們不能不承認，今天經濟的情形確係相富嚴重，但是今天我們中國的經濟是不是已經到了無法挽救的地步，像共匪所宣傳的即將趨於崩潰呢？抑或今天我們經濟上種種紛亂和不安的現象，是由於我們本身的心理所造成呢？爲答覆這個問題，我今天可以將國家財政。經濟的數字坦白的吿訴大家，截至上月底爲止，我們法幣發行總額，不到七十萬億元，然而我們政府現存的白銀和黄金，總計約値尖金一億一千萬元，中央銀行　其他國家行局所存外匯的總額，達美金一億八千萬元，兩項合計約爲美金二億九千萬元，而上月國務會議決定將資源委員會一部分工廠和中紡公司與招商局等各一部份的資源，以及敵偽產業和賠償物資撥交中央銀行，隨時可以變價的，總數約爲四億美元，兩者合計已有七億美元，如照目前牌價合計，即可抵法幣發行總額三倍以上。而最近美國國會所通過的援華貸款尙不在內，由此可知，我們法幣的準備非常充足，金融的基礎非常鞏固，金融基礎的鞏固，就證明我們經濟基礎並未動搖，現在人心惶惶，以為經濟即將趨於崩潰這完全是受了共匪及其工具宣傳的影響，對國家失了信心，因而造成了自己害自己的恐慌心理，各位令天聽的本人負責的報吿，就可以袪除這種無謂的疑慮了。本人自從去年以來，因焉分心於軍事的指導，對於財政金融顧慮不周，以致在執行的方法和技術上，不免造成若干疏忽，這是我應該負責了，但我們有此基礎，一定能挽救經濟的危機，力謀經濟的復興，更望各位代表同心一德，信任政府，安定人心，以動勞節約，作全國同胞的倡導，則我相信今後經濟基礎必日趨安定，經濟情形必日益好轉。</p>
<p>說明軍事情形　糾正錯誤看法</p>
<p>其次要講到軍事的情形，現在大家看共匪的猖獗，就認爲是軍事的失敗，其實這是一種錯誤的看法。要知道國軍剿匪眞正的軍事行動，從去年三月的攻克延安纔開始，在此以前，國軍對於共匪的侵犯，只是消極的自衛行動，國軍與共匪的接觸，到現在亦不過一年半的時間，在這一年半的中間，國軍達成了兩個重要的戰略目標，第一是鞏固國軍要點，使共匪不能取得外來的援助。國軍於卅五年收復了承德。張家口，去年九月克復了烟台，使共匪陸上海上對外交通完全隔絕，就是這一目的的達成。第二是佔領共匪首腦部所在地，這就是去年三月的克復延安，使共匪喪失他政治根據地，不得不東西流竄，而成爲流寇，國軍爲達成這兩大目標，當然要付出相當代價，遭受相當犧牲，然而我們的犧牲有重要的意義，而且已經予匪軍以重大的打擊，所以我們並不能算是失敗，這是各位必須了解的。現在我再要就各戰塲形勢分別說明如下：</p>
<p>東北今後戰略　消滅共匪主力</p>
<p>先就東北來說，現在國軍在東北所佔的地區是縮小了，交通是被切斷了，這是由於匪軍在兵力上形成了優勢，自從國軍在東北作戰以來，前後損失了七個師，但這七國師除了整編四十九師以外，都是臨時編成的三團制的部隊，至於正規的國軍，則並無重大損朱，尤其是第二軍·第五十三軍·第六軍·第七十一軍·第九十三軍·新一軍·新六軍，都能屹立不搖，健全無損·然而，匪在東北的力量，確實比前增加了三分之一，因之，局勢就顯得相當的嚴重，但是我們只要守住了瀋陽·長春·錦州幾個重要的據點，就必能保障東北久永是我們國家的領土。這幾個據點是必須固守，而且必能固守的，我們須知，失敗的意義乃是指「基本力量」的消滅，而國軍今天在東北的形勢，乃是基於戰略的變更，並非由於基本力量的削弱·過去的戰略重在收復失土，今後的戰略重在消滅整個共匪的主力。爲了適應新戰略，就不能分散兵力作全面的控制，而我們收復東北的決心，則是始終不變的。</p>
<p>華北西北戰塲　國軍培養奮戰</p>
<p>其次要說到華北，自從石家莊失陷，第三軍的第七師，第十二師被消滅，這是我們重要都市第一次的失陷，當然是我們一個重大的損失，但除了第三軍以外，其他華北所有的部隊，都在不斷的充實，不斷的加强，尤其是傳總司令統一指揮以來，其所領導的華北各軍，更是一天天在培養成長之中，在不久的將來，這個戰塲上，我相信一定能表現良好的戰績，所以我們不可因一時一地的得失進退來判斷整個剿匪軍事的成敗。</p>
<p>至於西北方面，最近陜西宜川一役，第廿九軍軍長劉戡的陣亡，固然是國軍一次重大的損失，然而就整個在陜西兵力而言，至多不過損失了六分之一，其餘如第一軍等所屬各師及獨立旅，仍然完整健全，都在繼續努力作戰，而固守楡林兩次擊退敵人圍攻的廿二軍，以少勝多，備著忠勇，更是就地奮鬥，配合發揮我們的戰力，因此，確保西北是絕無問題的。</p>
<p>華中共匪猖獗　是被迫的流竄</p>
<p>復次，再講華中，在黄河以南，長江以北的地區，幾個月來備受共匪的猖獗竄擾，但要知道這是共匪被迫的流竄，而不是他本來的目的，我可以吿訴各位，共匪之竄擾華中，當然要延長一點剿匪的時間，但共匪陰謀決不得逞。共匪的主要目的，本在佔領華北，但因去年六目國軍進剿魯中，陳毅匪部無法抵抗，企岡分成兩股，一股竄回蘇北，一部取道魯西竄往河北，惟其時秋雨連綿，黄河。運河水勢大漲，無法偸渡，而劉伯承股爲應援陳毅，竄渡黄河以後，又經國軍節節邀擊，使其無法回竄，乃將錯就錯，流竄到黄泛區和大別山區。大別山一股則爲劉伯承所部，大家都知道劉伯承是共匪中最兇悍的匪首，當時他帶了六個縱隊竄入大別山區，妄想以大別山區爲根據地，東面威脅首都，西面威脅武漢，並且揚言今年五月要南渡長江，八目要西入四川，但經白部長坐鎭九江，指揮國軍出動痛剿，現在他在大別山區的力量，已只剩零星的三四個團了，其餘的不能立足，皆已逃回黃泛區，而且到處竄擾。此時，山東·河南的人民，當然是感到痛苦，而切望國軍解救的，但是大家要知道，我必定在三個月到六個月以內，肅淸其在黄河以南整個集結的匪部。</p>
<p>機動使用兵力　打擊匪軍陰謀</p>
<p>我對軍事從不肯輕易預測，自剿匪以來，凡我所宣示的，無不如期達到，即如張家口。承德的收復，延安的攻克，以及魯中膠東的掃蕩，凡是戰略上所決定的，沒有不依限完成。大家應該信任我的計畫，加强勝利的信心，更須知道，過去的戰略，第一在於確保國防據點，這一層已完成達到，第二爲解救人民，不能不以佔領土地爲重，而今後的戰略，則必須着重於擊潰匪軍的主力，爲了打擊一匪軍牽制我軍的陰謀，對若干地點有時不能不暫時放棄，俾能集中兵力，機動使用，殲滅匪軍的主力，在這種戰略實施的時候，有些地區的同胞，或不免要忍受一時的痛苦，然而他們遲早一定可以得到團軍的撫救。（下文轉入二版）</p>
<h3>傳作義氏受驚　國大決致慰問</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕華北剿匪總司令傅作義，自集寗飛平乘機失事微傷，國大代表極爲關念，決致電慰問，電文已由秘書處草擬，將提出大會通過後發出。</p>
<h3>國大紀程　風平浪靜的一天</h3>
<p>本報特寫（四月九日於南京）</p>
<p>連日晴暖，會塲裏情緒激動，許多會議程序問題，都胖在情緒的糾葛裏，八日會議中所表現的乖戾與混亂，可謂登峯造極，幸得風雨終宵，九日晨烟霧迷濛，氣溫陡降二十度，會塲的一切，也隨着平靜下來。九日上下午會議全程大體上頗爲順利，午前蔣主席出席報吿，他一向的人望和坦白，誠使代表們一致心悅誠服，始終靜聽；午後討論議事規則和提案審委會組織規程的會議也是融融洩洩，東風無力，欲皺還休。九日上午，人人都爲蔣主席的蒞臨報吿而興奮。二千五百七十九位代表中，衹有兩百零兩個沒到，主席台上除蔣夫人外尙有大批政府官員。洪蘭友兩度宣吿由國民政府蔣主席作施政報吿後，全塲起立，主席於掌聲中步至發言台，强調國大的非常任務，接着使是竭誠擁戴的掌聲，震揭了大會堂的整個建築。隨後，他開始經濟與軍事的報吿，蔣主席一個半小時的報吿，造成了上午會議的報吿，造成了上午會議的井然秩序，並且他最後的感想與願望，在下午第四次大會里同時發生了解除糾葛的情緒的效力，下午三時四十分，主席甘乃光在洪蘭友的協助下，開始繼續討論議則，前一日鼓動風浪的人們都寂寂無聲，僅僅幾個，由於甘乃光話太多，越解釋越糾纏不淸，造成小小的波浪。六十六條議事規則的後半，和九條提案審委會組織規程全部，在洪蘭友朗誦之後，或表決修正，或無異議維持原案，暢快的被處理完事。國大開過的所有會議里，從來沒有　九日第四次會議這麽順利的。</p>
<p>大會從三月廿九日開幕，至今已開過十幾次會議，但不過方把有關會議程序的問題進行完畢，人們多少有些疲勞了，九日下午會議到了末了，僅有一千一百四十六位代表在席。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕下午大會進行如流水，惟主席台上程序稍有紊亂，大會旁聽席次有限，對申請者不得不從嚴限制，三個代表只能介紹一人旁聽，各代表對請求簽名者，十個有七個均數告曰：「老兄弟　了一步，剛　過一次章了。」有人詢某代表何以無高見，渠喟然嘆曰：「誰還有勇氣發言，周鯁生敎授也被噓下來了」。</p>
<h3>第一屆國大議程　今起舉行大會檢討國是　十五及十七日選舉總統副總統</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕第一届國民大會議程，定十日第五次大會中提出討論，大會主席團已作此決定，該議程中包恬四部，分（一）檢討國是，（二）提案審査，（三）提案討論，（四）選舉總統。副總統。主席團九日下午八時開會時，由周鍾嶽主席，擬定十日，十二日，十三日三天舉行大會，檢討國是，十一日休息，十日上下午大會主席，已推定由薛篤弼，白崇禧担任。關於總統·副總統之選舉，秘書處所擬之草案爲：十五日選舉總統，十七日選舉副總統，均於前三日公吿候選人姓名。主席團會商時，未作具體決定，副總統提名之簽署書，原擬每一單位一份，爲避免流弊，主席團決定以人爲單位，每代表發給副總統提名簽署書一份，自由提名。</p>
<h3>國大議則　討論完畢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕國大第四次大會，九日下午三時四十分舉行，主席團第六組輪値，由甘乃光主席，繼續討諭大會議事規則草案及提案審査委會組織規程草案，均風平浪靜，全部順利修正通過，發言者較歷次會議爲少。</p>
<h3>經部核准　燃煤新價</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕燃煤新價經濟部已核准自四月份起變行，茲誌新價如下：（一）華東煤三月份浦口交貨價每噸爲四〇四萬元，四月份加百分之卅三，每噸爲五三七萬元。（二）淮南煤浦口交貨價爲三二一萬元，四月份起加百分之卅三，爲四二七萬元。（三）開　煤三月份秦皇島船上交貨價爲三〇四萬元，四月份調整後與淮南煤同價（四二七萬元），約加百分之四另點五弱。（四）合灣煤燃管會另案呈報。</p>

<p>蔣主席在國大作施政報告　（本報攝）</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<h3>社論　毋負人民與政府的期望</h3>
<p>——續蔣主席演說之後</p>
<p>國民大會昨晟舉行第四次大會，蔣主席親臨大會作施政後告，雖然坦白承認目前局勢的嚴重，但是分析闡內經漬情形及軍事形勢，不僅經濟基礎穩固，而且剿亂前途殊可樂觀；這一席率真坦白的話，對於目前團內的人心可以發生恒大的安定力量，足使一般人對於經漬所發生的恐慌心理以及對於剿亂軍事所抱的失敗主義，均能消滅於無形，共匪近年來對於經濟及軍事所作種種的宣傳攻勢，也就可以不攻自陂了。</p>
<p>我們把蔣主席的演詞，誦讀再三，其要點有下列各項：（一）指出本届國大的任務，一在行憲，使中國政治脚踏實地跨步走上民主憲政的正軌；另在剷除行憲的陣碍，達成建國的任務。（二）說明目前的經濟基礎絕對穩固，並以法幣的發行額，國家所有的準備金以及所有的物資，證明法幣今日對於物價的幣値，遠在其實際價値之下，所以目前的經濟危機，乃在共匪所造成人民對於法幣的不安心理。（三）分析目前的剿匪軍事，以堅決而誠懇的口吻，表示確信必獲最後勝利。質言之：東北方面，衹要瀋陽長春錦州在國軍掌握之中，即可保證東北永遠是我們的；華北軍事，自傳作義將軍負責主持之後，情勢已逐漸好轉；華中戰局，自白部長親往剿匪後，共匪東竄四流，已成爲流寇，黄河南岸之共郎短期內即可消滅。（四）勗勉國大代表，以非常的心情來完成國大所負的任務，切勿任性鬧成笑話，爲共匪製造宣傳資料。</p>
<p>蔣主席的演辭充滿了熱情與眞誠，不要說在座的國大代表，均深受其感動；就是我們老百姓在報紙上看到蔣主席的演辭，也感到極大的安慰，並且相信過去的不安心理，不啻是一種「庸人自擾」，只要全國朝野都能　明的領袖領導之下，以共同一致的步伐，走上和平。民主·統一·强大的坦途，必能完成我們所負的歷史使命。這次國大的召開，端在實行憲法，依照憲法的規定，選舉總統副總統，如使我國政治跨開走向民主憲政的第一步，人民對於本届國大的希望，就在於完成這一個重大的任務；各地國大代表受人民的委託，晉京出席本届國大會議，其所欲完成的使命，也就在此，所以這次國大是「只許成功，不許失敗」的；實在是我國民主憲政的重大關鍵，光明或黑暗，就要看這次會議的結果。</p>
<p>但本届國大自三月廿九日開幕以來，忽已兩週，我們看看國大開會的情形，會塲秩序似不甚佳，有時代表爭先發言，或拍桌叫罵；也有時代表噓唇嘲弄，或無端鼓掌，以致會議程序無法進行，最初六七天來，爲了選舉主席團，好幾天停留在「預備會議」的階段；及至正式會議舉行，又因爲了討論議事規則，幾乎引起軒然大波；這些現象雖爲民主國家的議會所不可避免，但是天天吵吵鬧鬧，使大會不能照預定日期進行，終不是一個辦法；何况集二三千代表於首都，政府一日耗費達七十億元之鉅，豈非勞民傷財，京滬一部份報紙，對於國大此種情形，早已有微飼；蔣主席演說，亦諄諄吿誡，勸代表勿再鬧笑話，爲仇者所快，爲共匪製造宣傳資料。我們亦深望國大代表諸公，深切反省，認淸代表所負的使命，從速集中意志，如期完成本届國大的任務，庶不負選民的期望。目前國大所面臨之難題，尙有兩項，吾人願就此二事，向國大代表進一言。</p>
<p>第一是修改憲法問題。依照憲法第二十七條及第一百七十四條之規定，本　國大自可修改憲法，但任何法政制度均無絕對的優劣，我國憲法尙宋付諸實施，尙無事實可以證明其有修改的必要。何况憲法應有固定性，不宜輕易修改，此乃一般憲法學者公認的原理。回憶前年十二月間國大對論憲草時，也不知費了多少辱舌，才能使這部比較民主的進步的憲草通過，成爲今“實施的中華民閱憲法，若未經實施即加以重大的修改，則前年的制憲工作，也就是成爲徒勞了。再以目前的政治環境而論，靑年黨，民社黨，以及一般無黨派者，均已表示反對本届國大修改憲法，若不尊重少數黨的意見，勢必引起新的糾紛。所以我們雖承認國大有修改憲法的權力，也不視憲法條文爲神聖不可侵犯；但是反對本屆國大對憲法作重大的修改，若欲擴大國大的職權，或欲恢復五五憲草的條款，我們認爲這些都　　第二是國大檢討國是問題。前天通過的議事規則，巳增加了一條「國民大會開會時，得聽取政府施政報吿，檢討國是，並得提出質詢建議」。從表面上看，這一條似與憲法第廿七條相抵觸；但其實並不是如此的。因爲國民大會是行使政權的機關，得以行使創制權，僅因第二十七條附有一項「但書」，在全國未有半數之縣市行使創制複決之前，國民大會不能行使創制權。不過我們看歐美民主國家採取兩院制的，不論是參議院或是衆議院，都有聽取政府施政報告及向政府詢問的權。加以本届國大正在時局最嚴重的時候舉行，更有討論國是的必要。但是討論國是不必一定要在大會內進行，在會外也是可以舉行的，反正是一種交換意見的性質，可以向政府質詢，也可以向政府提供建議，但不能通過任何決議，即使有所決議，也沒有拘束政府的力量，祇能供給當局參考。</p>
<p>上面的解釋，完全依據法理，代表諸公如能保持冷靜，尊重法理，那末本屆大會自可順利進行，如期完成其重大的任務，不致負人民與政府的期望了。</p>
<h3>主席在國大報告詞　勦匪部隊淘汰　無捐國軍實力　匪傷亡超出國軍三倍</h3>
<p>自從勦匪戰爭展開以來，國軍確實損失了十七個師，這中間包括有若干訓練不充分的暫編部隊，也有作戰多年的部隊，由於少數將領的懈怠無能，或管理不嚴，不能保守秘密而失敗，這些部隊的損失，無異於自歸淘汰，於整個國軍實力可說是無所損失，現在眞正精練的國軍，實力不僅並未削弱，而且日益增强。至於國軍的損失，約爲總數百分之十，而這幾個月來已完成了八成的補充，大家不要衹聽匪方的宣傳，祗看見了已損失的百分之十的軍隊，而不看見百分之九十的健全精强的部隊。實際上自剿匪作戰以來，國軍固然有損失，而匪軍的損失還要火過國軍幾倍，我在這裏可以舉出詳細的數字來對照，在卅五年度，國軍的傷亡人數廿一萬餘人，匪軍的傷亡人數五十二萬餘人，被俘的國軍是二萬三千人，而匪軍被俘的是五萬四千人。在卅六年度，國軍傷亡的人數四十一萬餘人，匪軍傷亡人數一百六十餘萬人，被俘的國軍爲十二萬人，而匪軍被俘的是十一萬六千人，總計匪軍傷亡被俘的人數超過國軍三倍以上。火家切不可衹看匪方的宣傳，而忽　了國軍重火的犧牲業巳取得了三倍以上的代價，尤其我軍高級將領的忠勇殉職，都是戰到最後的一兵一卒，然後壯烈自戕。例如廿九軍軍長劉戡，卅五軍軍長魯英　，六十九師師長戴之奇，七十四師師長張靈甫等，充分表現了我們國民革命軍臨危不屈，殺身成仁的精神，顯示了我們悠久　高的民族精神力量，這些先烈史續？都是可歌可泣的。我們國軍中　然也有軍紀不良和貪汚腐敗的事實，但是大家不可以一槪的涇渭不分，以一個官兵如此，因而誤會所有全體的官兵都是如此，要知道我們軍隊這樣多，自民國廿年開始剿匪，經過八年抗戰，接着又繼續剿匪，如此長期久戰，要所有軍隊一律都是紀律嚴明，當然是不易做到，我可以說，今天絕大多數的國軍將領，都是奉公守法，不惜犧牲，而且能够堅忍不拔，以少勝多。匪軍雖如何盛誇戰績，誣蔑國軍，實際上我們除了已經淘汰損失的以外，儘有不少部隊堅定挺立，固守崗位，而且主動的找匪。打匪，使匪軍不敢與之接觸的。</p>
<p>大家不可忽略　共匪挑撥陰謀</p>
<p>更有一點是大家不可忽略的，共匪一貫的陰謀，是企圖挑撥分化我們的國軍，他誣稱我們若干部隊是中央軍，若干部隊是地方軍，他對於其所謂地方軍，向來是沒有發現他們的力量的，但在這次剿匪作戰中，這些部隊都發揮了充分的戰鬥精神，旣不是共匪可能挑撥動搖，更不是共匪卑劣的心理始料所及。例如察綏部隊，大家都知道是最勇敢善戰，深得民心，晋軍則固守臨汾，面對三倍以上的敵人堅持兼旬，挺立不搖。又如在長江一帶作戰的廣東部隊，在東北的　南部隊，在大別山區的廣西部隊，在華中的四川部隊，都是鬥志旺盛，精神奮發。至於在陜西的寗夏部隊，在隴東的靑海部隊，都能保持其歷史的光榮，發揮其剿匪的特長，而造成良好的戰果由此足以證明經過了八年抗戰，全中國的部隊都已受了民族精神的薰陶，死生一體，團結一心，更沒有地域區別之可言，可以說，今天對於共匪不但全國官兵誓不與之兩立，就是我全國人民也無不與之同仇敵愾，認定這一個出賣民族的流寇盜匪爲必須勦除的唯一敵人，我們以民族大義來對付賣國漢奸，以民族團結來對付階級專政，順逆之所在，就是成敗之所判。現在關內共匪數量與番號誠然而有增加，今後要達成最後勝利，自然還要經過艱苦的奮鬥，然而共匪兵力的擴大，祗是脅迫匪區壯丁不加訓練而驅使作戰，我們如能按照戰略一致努力，我本着二十餘年來統兵作戰的經騐，省察軍事實際的情形，對於剿匪軍事確實非常樂觀，只要我們全國同胞不爲共匪的宜傳所搖惑，認淸眞象，堅定信心，加强軍民協作，健全自衛組織，則最後勝利實無疑問。各位聽了我的報吿以後，就可知道國家的基礎是絕對安全，無所用其恐懼了。</p>
<p>希望代表履行　人民付託責任</p>
<p>最後要說明我對大會的希望，代表諸君受人民的付託來參加大會，最重要的任務自然是行憲，要確立憲政的規模和制度，而同時我們還有一層最迫切的任務，就是要拯救人民，解除人民當前最大的痛苦。中正是國民政府主席，但也是人民的一份子，我今天代表人民請命，要求代表諸君共同一致，集中精神和目光，正視我們人民共同敵人的共匪，貢獻我們所有的聽明才智，來奠立國基，戡平內亂，拯救水深火熟中的同胞，所以我們這次國民大會是行憲的國民大會，也就是救國救民的國民大會。代表諸君要知道，共匪是中國有史以來最陰險，最毒辣的盜匪流寇，是國家從來未有的叛逆，我們今天唯有發揚我們的革命精神和民族正氣，乃能戡平禍亂，挽回浩刧，目前的奮鬥，的確比抗戰還要艱難，然而這是善與惡，正與邪的戰爭。共匪今天一切的作爲，都是毁滅倫常，汨沒人性，違反我們中國民族的精神，縱然猖獗一時，最後未有不澈底失敗。代表諸君一定要體念國家今天形勢的艱危，更要知道自從我們國民大會召集以來，共匪無時無刻不在陰謀破壞，希望我們失敗，我們在大會中一言一動，都要出以十分的愼重，切不可授共匪以詆毁譏笑的口實。代表諸君一方面要認清自己的地位和職權，履行全國人民所付託的責任，同時更要認淸目前是一個非常時期，並非從容論道的時候，所以我們處理一切的問題，都要一本非常時期的精神，旣要簡單，又要迅速，才能爭取時間，拯救國家。這次大會集全國三千代表於一堂，不僅是中國有史以來的創舉，而且是今後國家盛衰興亡的關鍵，現在舉世矚目，看我們這次大會的結果如何，大會的成功，就是整個國家的成功，所以我們在大會期間處理任何問題，都必須集中意志，執簡　繁，使會議順利進行，切不可重視細節，議論紛紜，爭持不決。宋人所謂「議論未定，兵已渡河」，可見意志不一，足以貽誤國事，因此，我認爲爲了國家程序愈簡單愈好，議程的進行愈迅速愈好，這是我要向大會買獻的。</p>
<p>以上是本人代表政府向大會所作的政治總報告，供我們代表諸君的檢討，並希望不吝指敎。（全文完）</p>

<h3>美推進西德計劃　建議提早成立西德政府　三強洽商佔區合併事宜</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕確息：美國業已建議分爲五個階段，在一年內成立西德政府。英美法荷比慮六國專家於八日起在柏林討論德國問題時，即係以此爲主題。　計劃規定之五個階段爲：（一）組織包括目前英美合併區及法國區的臨時政府；（二）各邦間界綫予以調整；（三）選舉制　議會：（四）由該議會起草憲法；（五）成立正式的新德國政府。美國此一計劃係本於最近柏林的發展而擬成，堪被視爲華盛頓及德境美佔領當局最近的正式態度。此間人士相信法國在日前尙不擬　更其前此所已宣布的立塲，即在尙未先行解決德國未來政治機構及魯爾國際管制　兩個與法安全有關的問題前，不能就法國區與英美區合併事成立決議。可靠方面謂參與柏林六國會談之英代表業已對美國之首創修改三區合併時間表，給予廣泛的支持。觀察家並信美國鑒於柏林最近的危機，需要加緊在政治上及經濟上組織西德，以爲西歐復興整個計劃之一部，此外美國並以爲荀不採取步驟以成立西德臨時政府，則不免將面臨東據國家及政府的旣成事實，因此美國已決定加速推動其對西德的計劃。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕美國所提於一年內成立西德政府之計劃，頗引起法官方之疑懼。彼等認爲美計劃爲確如外界所傳者，則西德制憲議會之選舉，極可能引起法國最懼的中央集權政府‘參與六國專家談判之法代表繆維爾，預料將堅決反對西德中央政府之設，而將堅持使各邦保特强大權力的聯邦基礎政府。法國並認在弗朗克福所設之政府，無論如何總不如在柏林所設之政府有號召力。繆維爾將代表法政府請英美勿中蘇聯之計，而予蘇聯　在柏林設立德國政府之藉口。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕杜魯門總統今日拒絕評論外傳美國業已提出在一年內成立西德政府的五點計劃之報吿。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕外交部發言人稱：英美法三國代表將於本月後半期在倫敦開會，恢復討論以自給基礎組織西德之問題。英內閣今日曾開會討論德國問題，英國之就對德政策不擬作任何讓步，殆可斷言。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕英外部發言人頃鄭重否認法方報告所稱貝文外相將於下週赴柏林宣布西德國成立之說。該法方發出之倫敦報吿謂，蘇聯如繼續抵制盟管會，西德政府即將宣布成立。</p>
<h3>英對蘇軍司令覆文不滿　考慮戰門機護航　美法亦將採取同樣步驟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林八日電〕英軍當局接獲蘇軍司令索柯洛夫斯基覆文，拒絕書面保證不千涉空中走廊後，英美兩國今夜車新考慮派遣戰鬥機保護運輸機飛至柏林之計劃。法國方面預料亦將採取同樣步驟。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林九日電〕英空軍發言人稱：塔斯社所稱英蘇已任命聯合委員團，共同調査英蘇飛機互撞事之說，渠並無所知。英空軍方面並未奉有此項指令。另據盟國航空當局之負責官員稱，蘇聯塔斯社之聲明並不新穎亦不重要，但可表示蘇聯或將開始要求變更航空規則。一年餘以來盟國對蘇機之飛臨盟國機塲及其他違反規則之行爲，已一再表示不滿，而蘇聯亦對英美表示不滿，此互相控訴實已成老調矣。</p>
<h3>對德盟管會　例會未召開</h3>
<p>蘇批准設東德經濟委會</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林九日電〕德境美軍司令克萊今日宣稱：明日爲盟管會舉行例會之日，但因四國均未要求開會，屆時將無會議。克氏爲該委會四月份輪値主席，此語顯示自蘇職最近企圖迫令西方各國退出柏林以來，四國合作之希望益趨暗淡。同時蘇軍當局今日聞已最後批准在東德佔領區設立共黨控制之經濟委員會。</p>
<h3>美蘇佔領區交界　蘇哨兵放朝天槍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林九日電〕此間美蘇佔領區交界處蘇軍哨兵今日突向美軍佔領區朝天開槍數發，據稱蓋欲嚇退黑市商人一批。美方守衛遂向憲兵吿急，嗣經憲兵趕到，始悉該區平靜無事。美軍當局不致提出抗議。</p>
<h3>柏林盟軍　司令會議　英駁斥蘇指責</h3>
<p>六小組會准予廢止</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林八日電〕柏林四强聯合司令部於西方强國同意蘇聯要求之廢止該部所屬六國委員會後，業於今日繼續舉行會議。蘇聯原要求廢止八個委員會，使其任務併入其他委會。蘇聯要求解散者爲建築及房屋·運輸·經濟。社會·燃料·財產管制·肅淸納粹及文化等八個委會，經西方强國讓步後，已由四强同意保留經濟委會，將財產管制委會之存廢問題，交四强司令處理，其餘六個委員會則予廢止。四强聯合司令部開會時，英代表班森準將指賫蘇當局限制客貨運輸，企圖窒息柏林。渠又重新否認蘇代表葉利隡洛夫於四月二日指責西方三强「刧掠柏林」之說，指蘇方欲以此爲藉口而實行交通管制。</p>

<h3>救世軍領袖逝世</h3>
<p>〔路透社雪梨九日電〕救世軍將軍卡本特，九日下午病逝此間醫院，享年七十五歲。渠於一九四六年卸任救世軍國際領袖之戰，去年十一月起即臥病醫院。渠足跡遍及澳洲南美加拿大及他國。卡本特原籍紐西蘭，係繼救世軍創辦者之女彼斯將軍而長救世軍，身後殊爲蕭條。</p>
<h3>美對西歐五國聯盟　將予以有力支援　惟應取方式尚待最後決定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕計劃中之西歐聯盟，似已確可獲美堅强之軍事援助，以增强西方各國抵抗蘇聯擴張之力量。但據華盛頓官方意見，尙有幾個重大問題須待解決，此項援助之準確形式即爲其一。比總理史巴克，本星期曾與杜魯門總統，國務部次長洛維特及美國其他領袖在此間會商，據史氏招待記者稱，歐洲國家稍後將請美國與以軍事及復興方面援助。惟新組織尙在初步時期，各國當先加以鞏固。國務部及國防部官員曾研究美國援助應取何種方式，此有兩種可能。其一由美國就西歐各國所需槍砲，彈藥，飛機，坦克等等之援助，担任武裝其軍隊。其二則與西歐聯盟直接訂立軍事同盟。</p>

<p>共値百億美元以上</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕國務部發言人宣稱：美蘇協商淸理蘇聯租借法案債款一百零六億美元已獲若千進步。主要問題已獲致協議，但尙有問題甚多留待解決。國務部將載時簽訂之四種援蘇議定書原文予以公布，藉以答覆衆院剩餘物資委會主席昆恩所稱美國於戰事結束後仍根據羅斯福所簽訂之秘密議定書繼續將軍火運蘇一節之控吿。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕國務院今晚發表戰時四件草約之內容，根據此等草約，美國曾徇蘇聯之請求，除純粹軍用配備外，以非軍用之物資數百萬噸，接濟蘇聯，以便進行對納粹德國之戰爭。美國在租借計劃下所供給之物資，共値一百零七憶七千四百萬美元。文件之序言中，指出蘇聯以現款購買之戰時物資，僅有百分之二。租借之數字顯示，除純粹軍用物資外，對蘇最大之運載爲五十種不同之糧食近四百五十萬短噸。在全部物資中，工業之機器與配備價値在十億美元以上。美國運交蘇聯之物資計鋼類二百八十萬短噸，非鐵金屬物八十萬二千噸，煤　產物二百六十萬噸，棉布一億零六百萬碼以上，車胎連裏胎三百萬隻以上，及長靴一千五百萬雙以上。</p>
<h3>斯揣克減少日賠償報告　蘆田表示不滿足　屬島與漁權問題盼由和會解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京八日電〕日首相蘆田均今告中央社記者稱：日本現有甚多問題，等待和會解決。其山最重要問題之一，爲日本附近各小島歸屬問題。數日前美國記者謂：漫認爲環球爲日本不可分之一部，實則非是，　所指者，爲蘇聯於日本投降後佔領之北海道以東各小島，各島能論於地理上，法律上，或歷史上，均非屬於按照戰爭結束前盟國協議劃歸蘇聯之千島羣島。</p>
<p>此外漁權問題，亦待和會解決。目前日本漁船活動範圍甚小，僅能到達伯令海，南太平洋及中國海岸之少數地區，然因日本人民仰賴海爲食物，希望漁區可以擴大。又斯揣克報吿顯未改變賠償之狀况，在此問題解決之前，日本工業，不能有何計劃。關於美國可能單獨許可日人入境事，蘆田稱：獲准入美者，係爲美國消費者，及日本出口貨製造廠家從事居間工作之少數日人。和約簽訂前，日本尙不能自由進行國外貿易。</p>

<h3>美貸欵拉丁美洲計劃　泛美會反應冷淡　美用意在打擊啊哈根廷之建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社波哥大八日電〕美國八日遭遇泛美會議歷史上最冷淡之挫折。當美國在泛美會議宣讀杜魯門總統要求國會以另一項出口銀行之五億元借教，貸與南美之文吿時，美洲二十餘個國家琴加泛美會議之代表團，皆端坐靜聽，寂然無聲，美代表團極爲窘迫而忿怒。</p>
<p>馬歇爾排定將此一文吿在八日全體大會末次會議　宣讀，預料此一新聞能博取熱情，但相反，杜魯門要求之全文，自始至終，大禮堂中，鴉鵲無聲，讀畢後仍寂然如前。美代表承認其「引誘一」業已失敗。彼等之忿怒不能消一除，蓋彼等認爲拉丁美洲無感謝一之意。此次杜魯門咨文之宣讀，乃反擊阿根廷對經濟問題之領導及其新泛美銀行之建議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社哥倫比亞波哥大八日電〕美國代表團今日提議澈底現由泛美大會討論之經濟計劃，請其他美洲國家减低關稅，廢除國際貿易限制，以促進世界經濟繁榮。</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯霍華特系報業聯合會版權所有　本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（十四）忽視中國內部局勢</p>
<p>美國戰時對華援助的大部份，是用於緬甸周圍的作戰，而中國國內的局勢，却惡化到接近災殃。</p>
<p>我手頭沒有統計，可以顯示出在緬甸作戰期間美國所作努力的分配情形，但是我估計中緬印戰區全部能力的大約百分之九十，是用在這道方面的。</p>
<p>從一開始起，史迪威將軍和他戰區司令部的人員，簡直完全忽視擴充駝峯空運的可能和需要，惟以有關緬甸作戰者爲例外。對於緬甸作戰的特別注意，可由一點見之，那就是他把原來派到印度去改善飛機塲以謀增進自上緬甸飛越希馬拉耶山脈空運的八個航空工程團，改用以建築來多公路。</p>
<p>我們的戰略——那就是說史迪威將軍的戰略——把中國境內的重事努力，限於據守的行動，而在一九四四年中，就是據守也談不到了。</p>
<p>中國不惟未能對戰勝日本在攻勢上有所貢獻，甚至在一九四四年時接近完全崩潰的情形，當時日本的攻勢掠取了中國的東部，而使開放一個中國港口以與太平洋方面美軍那得協調的可能性，减少到不能計算的程度。</p>
<p>緬甸作戰首先恢復了一條漫長，艱難而其價値又頗成問題的卡車通路，並且敷設了一條輸油管到中國西南部，後者是它最具體直接的一種貢獻。此外，並使飛越駝峯的路綫向南移動了一些，不必像以前那樣飛越極高的高度了。</p>
<p>假如北緬不能藉史迪威將軍的作戰而將日軍肅淸，要每月空運三萬噸以上的貨物到中國來，或許是不可能的，但是假如沒有緬甸的作戰，那麽我們的全部力量都可用於中國本身，而不是僅用極小的一部份了</p>
<p>我們也不致在正當日本即將失敗的前夕失却中國東部。爲了這種說法看來頗似事後的猜想起見，我必須補充說明一點，就是正當我們的戰略在擬定的時候，我就是這樣想的。我甚至相信縱使我們把大部份的力量放在緬甸，我們還是可以保持中國東部的。</p>
<p>我們失却中國東部的原因，祗是爲了力量上稍差了一點。假如幾百噸供應品能在適當的時間送達適當的地方，局勢就可以挽救。</p>
<p>我對於史迪威的設計，衹可能有兩種困難的解釋：或者是地以爲把緬甸來交換中國東部及其前進空軍基地是値得的，或者是他在進行北緬作戰之同時，根本沒有增强中國內部的遠見。</p>
<p>我們在蕪最簡單的軍事目標，就是要支持中央政府，後者自一九三七年以來曾牽制日軍百萬以上，因此當美國遠征軍需要在亞洲大陸上岸的時候，可以得到它的合作。</p>
<p>在一九四四年初日軍發動攻勢之前，戰區司令部對於中國內部的局勢，從沒有健全的估計。縱使在攻勢發動之後，我的司令部所屢次提出的警吿和建議，還是一直被忽視或低估的。</p>
<p>戰區司令部和中國司令部的合作關係，是不充份和緊張的。對於防禦自由中國的軍隊，美國的具體援助並不存在，衹支持了一個小規模的空軍，而後者的效能又不斷爲其他方面爭取駝峯空運供應品而遭障礙</p>
<p>一九四四年二月，我警吿史迪威將軍說日方似乎即將發動空中攻勢了。敵人的空中活動，乃是即將發動攻勢的第一個可得到的徵象。</p>
<p>在三月中，我要求獲得來自駝峯的供應品，藉以支持對敵人船隻的攻擊，以及維持中國東部空軍基地的實力。</p>
<p>我在三月中屢次請求，在四月中又屢次警吿，且出諸更具體的方式，因爲當時敵人發動攻勢的意向已愈來愈明顯了。但史迪威將軍對於這些預先提出的警吿所作最好的答覆，就是我們應以手頭所有的辦法，盡力做去——而實際上，這種辦法實在少得不堪。</p>

<p>文史顧炎武  容肇祖　　　顧炎武（一六一三－一六八二）在中國十七世紀的時代是一位大經師，然而僅說他是對於經學的重大成就，那也不免埋沒了他對於解放自己國家民族和改革社會政治的一些超越的見解與熱忱。在現在我們讀着他的著作，這些可寳貴的意見，覺得還很有意思。　　他在明末加入學生的組織－復社－和同縣（崑山縣）的歸莊，早有歸奇，顧怪的稱號，想是他的性格和作爲都有爲普通一般淺識的人所不能了解的特別的情形。他在一個朝代正走下坡路的貪汚腐敗的政治的時代，使他對於歷代的興廢存亡的史事，發生了絕大的興趣。　　一六四四年三月，李自成攻破了北京。五月，明將吳三桂引滿洲兵攻入北京城，趕跑了李自成。南京的福王，任用馬士英，阮大鋮，在妒賢忌能的內政爭攘中，又給滿洲兵侵入虜去。顧炎武和王永祚，吳其沅，歸莊等曾在蘇州起義，抗拒滿人，不幸失敗了，僅能隻身的逃跑出來。　　滿洲兵到了江南，顧炎武的家庭受了慘酷的遭遇，他的本生母在崑山被滿兵斬斷了右臂，弟弟子　，子武都遭殺害，他的守淸節的承繼母王氏在常熟，絕食十五日死了，遺命炎武：切勿投降滿洲」。炎武到常熟料理了母親王氏的喪事，就脫掉了學者衣冠，變做一個商人的樣子，到處流動。後來吃過兩次官司，一是一六五六年殺死了叛奴陸恩，爲土豪葉氏所訟，一是一六六八年在濟南爲了黄培作詩的文字獄，要出脫一些朋友而自首被緊。　　他漫遊南北，最後在陜西山西他停留了不算少的時間，他以爲這兩個地方是革命起義最好的根據地。一六六六年他在雁門之北，五臺之東，開始和李因篤們二十多人集資墾荒。後一六七七年，他定居陜西華陰，王弘撰供給他房子住，他自己又買了五十畝田地，生活似乎安定了。他對陝西地勢的險要和風俗人情，原來都有極大的好感。他見到黄宗義明夷待訪錄，馬上寫信給黄宗義，因爲黄宗義主張將來的中國要建都南京，他以爲南京僅可做偏安的小朝廷，而革命後開國的都城，必須要在陜西。　　黄宗義的明夷待　錄，草創在一六六二年，這時永歷帝已被殺，他是多次起義抗拒滿淸而沒有成功的。他本來抱有狹隘的忠於明朝的見解，　時明白了人民是國家的主人，而君主官史都不過是國家的僕役，他的原君，原臣　說明了君主與大臣的責任，反對自私自　，視天下爲自己產業的君主。又原法篇以爲中國幾千年君主　立的法，都是爲了保護自己家族的利益的法律，而不是爲廣大人民的權利打算的。他的奄宦上下篇感覺明朝的宰相六部等，都不過是些奉行奄宦命令的員司。顧炎武見到黄宗義的明夷待訪錄是在一六七六年，他給黄宗義的信說：「大箸待訪錄讀之再三，於是知天下之未嘗無人。……炎武以管見爲日知錄一書，竊自幸其中所論同於先生者十之六七。」他的日知錄是他平時讀書的隨手記錄，他讀書非常認眞，每種見解，都改了又改，或是古人已經先有的見解，就把自己的話删去，寫上古人的話。　　他的「國家以人民爲主體」的見解，是出發於他的平等思想。他說：「匹夫之心，天下人之心也。」（與人書七，亭林文集四）這樣，自然不贊成剝奪人民言論的自由，抹煞人民的利益，而冒稱自己是人民所擁戴的。　　他以爲君主是爲人民設立的，古代班爵的制度，天子與公侯伯子男只是等級的分別；班祿的制度，君卿大夫十和庶人做官是一樣的給俸祿，他們沒有耕田的入息，而勞動的酬報，即是「祿以代耕」。他說：「知祿以代耕之義，則不敢厚取於民以自奉。」（日知錄七周室班爵祿條）他以爲作首領的人，不是享福，而是盡義務；「享天下之大福者必光天下之大勞；宅天下之至貴者，必執大下之至賤。……能事人而後能使人，其心不敢失於一物之細，而後可以勝天下之大。舜之聖也而飯糗茹草，禹之聖也而手足餅胝，面目黎黑。」（日知錄七飯糗茹草條）　　他反對中央集權，法令如牛毛，以爲「法愈繁而弊愈多，天下之事日至於叢脞，其究也眊而不行，上下相蒙。」（日知錄八法制條）他覺得法令如毛，禁防嚴酷，都由於君主極權的專制「欲專大利而無受其大害，遂廢人而用法，廢官而用吏，禁防纖悉。」（同上）　　他主張尊重輿論：「崇月旦以佐秋官，進鄉評以扶國是。」「官職之升沈，本於鄉評之與奪。」「天下風俗最壞之地，清議尙存，猶足以維持一二。至於淸議亡而千戈至矣。日「（知錄一三濟議條）他注重興論，因此主張提倡名節以爲國家用人要：「名之所在，上之所庸，而忠信廉潔者顯榮於世；名之所去，上之所擯，而估侈貪得者廢錮於家。即不無一二矯偽之徒，猶愈於肆然而爲利者。……不能使天下人以義爲利，而猶使之以名爲利………亦可以救積洿之俗矣。」（日知錄一三名敎條）他又大聲疾呼的說：「士大夫之無恥，是謂國恥。」（日知錄一三廉恥條）　　關於社會土地的問題，他贊成魏司馬朗復井田的意見，『承大亂之後，民人分散，土業無主，皆爲公田，宜及此時復之。』（日知錄一九立言不爲一時條）『今將靜百姓之心，而改其行，必在制民之產，使之甘其食，美其服，而後敎化可行，風俗可善。』（日知錄卷一二人聚條）　　對於最高的執政首領的更換，他不覚得重要；而國與國間的爭戰勝敗，那是整個國家民族的主奴關係，這自然不同了。他說：『君臣之分，所關者在一身；夷夏之防，所繫者在天下。』（日知錄七管仲不死子糾條）他又說亡國與亡天下不同：『易姓改號，謂之亡國；仁義充塞，而至率獸食人，人將相食，謂之亡天下。……保國者，其君其臣肉食者謀之；保天下者，匹夫之賤，與有責焉耳矣。」（日知錄一三正始條）他以爲保衛國家不致喪失主權，那是什麼人都有責任的。　　顧炎武自己的人生觀有兩個見解：（一）『博學於文』；（二）『行己有恥』。他說學的範圍是？」自一身以至於天下國家，皆學之事也。』他說的恥，是」不恥惡衣懇食，而恥匹夫匹婦之不被其澤。」（與友人論學書，事林文集四）他又說：「君子之爲學，以明道也，以救世也，徒以詩文而己，所謂　蟲篆刻，亦何益哉？』（與人書二十五，亭林文集四）　　一六七八年，滿淸開設博學弘詞科，正要拉撤不臣服的遺民，又一六七九年，設修明史館，也是爲這個目的。顧炎武是絕對的拒絕妥協的，葉方藹，韓菼都想薦他，他豫吿各門人說。『刀繩具在，無速我死。』　　他往來山西陝西間，他的恢復祖國的熱誠，終底沒有得到成功的機會，不幸七十歲的時候，便在山西曲沃病死。他曾說：「夫子歸與歸與，未嘗一日忘天下也。故君子之學，死而後已。』（與人書六，亭林文集四）在現在看，他是不屈於現實之下，値得我們追念的一位學者。李觀不喜孟子  漆俠　　覯文格次於歐曾，其論治體，悉可見於實用。故朱子謂覯文實有得於經。不喜孟子特偶然偏見，與歐陽修不喜繫辭同，可以置而不論，贊必欲委曲彌縫，務滅其跡，所見陋矣。現今所流行的李覯的文集，實止有左贊編輯的這一種，書的前後並沒有左氏的序跋文字，因而不知其編輯的經過情形。見於「尊孟辨」中的幾段「常語」，旣全不見收於其中，則四庫提要以爲是左氏「諱而删之」的，想不致有誤。但提要把李氏文築中所有徵引孟子和稱道孟子的話，都以爲是左贊所竄亂的，我們却不能認可。　　今按李氏文集當中尙保存了不少非難孟子的話，並不限於提要中所舉「常語」中那三條。例如在「禮論第六」當中便不肯接受孟子的性善之說，在「平土書第二十」內，又對孟子所說」周人百畝而徹」的話不以爲然；在「原文」內認爲孟子「何必曰利」的話也失之偏激；在「叙陳公巒字」中，也以孟子所說「仲尼之徒無道桓文之事者」未免太過，和現存「常語」第一條立意大致相同；而在卷二十九之末，更有一篇「策問」　　孟子曰：「未有仁而遺其親者也，未有義而後其君也。」是時天子在上，而孟氏游於諸侯，皆說以王道，湯文武所以得天下之說，未聞一言獎周室者，庸非「後其君」乎？　　這一道策問的大旨，和「尊孟辨」中所引「常語」的語意更非常相近了。而以上這許多處所，旣未被左贊所删，也未被他加以竄亂，則提要中以爲左贊「必欲委曲彌縫，務滅其跡，」顯然是說得有些過火了。　　李氏文集中稱引孟子的話，除提要所舉「答李觀醫」的幾句而外，還有好多處。例如「周禮致太平論」中的「國用第一」和「第十」，「富國策第五」，「强兵策第三」諸文，其中便都引用了孟子的話作爲他立論的根據。而在「上孫寺丞書」中更有：　　不肖生二十三年，身不被一命之寵，家不藏担石之穀，鷄鳴而起，誦孔子孟軻羣聖人之言，纂成文章，以　康國濟民爲意。這幾句話，比答李觀書中「孟氏荀揚醉疵之說，不可復輕重」諸語，其推崇孟子之意格外淸楚，而詳其文義，却絕不是左贊所竄亂過的。（未完）　　今日「自由談」暫停一天。·自由談編輯室。跋太公家教  王重民　　是書爲唐末五代時童蒙課本，曾普遍流行一時，故敦煌寫本甚多，然無一佳者·王靜安先生首據羅氏唐風樓藏本作跋，載觀堂集林卷二十一。王氏云：「陶九成輟耕錄卷二十五所載金人院本名目，亦有太公家敎，蓋衍此書爲之。則此書至宋元間尙存。」按院本中之太公家敎，常如千字文道德經之類·摘取家敎中成語爲之，原書在金元時必能家傳戶誦；因非能家傳戶誦，不能演爲院本；說之於羣衆也。錢大昕元史藝文志小學類有女直字大公書，常即太公家敎，疑當時女直本行於滿州，漢文本仍在中原流行。法人古昻氏高麗書錄（Bibliographie　Careenne,　ParM.　Courant　1894）滿文類中有太公尙書，（第一一一號）稱：「見一四六九年滿文考試所用書中，一六八四年又經申繼黯重訂」。按一四六九年尙無滿文，此應指女直文，古昻氏誤也。女直文之爲朝鮮通文館中之一科，自滿人侵入，始易女直文爲滿文，則一四六七年頃通文館所用以試士之太公尙書，殆即錢氏所舉之大公書矣。碑傳集卷五十二引八旗通志阿什坦傳云：「阿什坦字海龍，順治二年以通滿漢文，選授內院六品他敕哈哈番，翻譯大學中庸孝經及通鑑總論太公家敎等書刊行之。」考明人無稱引太公家敎者，疑漢文本已佚；則阿什坦所據以譯爲滿文者，非女直文即高麗文，雖亦有據蒙文本之可能，余尙未尋得佐證也。清史稿文苑傳又稱：「阿什坦爲順治九年進士，初繙譯大學中庸」云云，其翻譯太公家敎，或在順治九年（一六五二）以前，則一六八四年申繼黯訂正之本，即阿什坦譯本，否則據阿什坦譯本以訂正舊本，約之申氏必已見阿譯本矣。是書譯本，自女直而高麗，而滿洲，五百年間，歷爲東北說各種語言之童蒙讀本，而中原自採用三字經百家姓以後，竟至亡佚。自敦煌石室之開，唐末五代間原本又出於世，而與太公家敎同出之百歲篇孔子項託相問書，又均在高麗有傳本，旦用以試童子，其書其事，均可互證。靜安先生輯五代兩宋人筆記，以溯是書之源，余繼其後，說其傳譯經過，以挹其流云。（三十年九月十一日）辛稼軒集中誤收秦檜詩  鄧廣銘　　—對於「稼軒詩文抄存」的一點糾正　　在淸代嘉慶年間，法式善和辛啓泰兩人從永樂大典和「五百家播芳大全文粹」等「類書」，以及幾種地方志常中，輯錄了辛稼軒的佚詩佚文和當時最通行的稼軒詞集所不載的一些詞，再加上辛啓泰所編的稼軒年譜，後來即由辛啓泰彙編為「稼軒集抄存」，刋布於世。　　稼軒集抄存中所收稼軒的詩共爲一百一十一首，其中却也有別人的作品，被辛啓泰誤收了的。例如「贈黄冠」一首，在現今通行的饒州府志和浮梁縣志的藝文志中無不收錄，題目都作「贈黄冠周宗先」，全詩的字句和抄存所載無一不同，而其作者却是辛次膺而不是稼軒。又如抄存原收有「鵝湖夜坐」五古一篇，其中頗多身世之感，却又無一事與辛稼軒的經歷相符合，原來這是誤收的陸游的一首詩，見陸游的劍南詩稿中。　　在抗戰軍興之前，我把辛稼軒的生平事蹟以加搜考，重新編定稼軒年譜一書。對於稼軒的詞，我也全部加以箋釋，特別是注重在本事的考訂方面。其後更就辛啓泰所輯錄的稼軒的詩和文，取歷代名臣奏議和現存的永樂大典殘卷等書，一一詳加　校，並補輯了辛啓泰所未收的文四篇，詩二十首，重行編定爲「稼軒詩文抄存」一書。前舉「附黄冠」和「鵝湖夜坐」兩詩，旣已考定不是稼軒的作品，自然應當删除，因而在我重編的這本「稼軒詩文抄存」當中，所收錄的各體詩，經辛啓泰原輯的尙有一百零九首，加上我所輯錄的二十首，共得一百二十九首。　　「稼軒詩文抄存」今春方由商務印書館印成，日來重加檢閱，竟又發見其中有題爲「御賜閣額」的兩首詩，是辛啓泰原輯而也被我收錄於「詩文抄存」當中的，原來也不是稼軒的作品。今將兩詩抄錄於後；　　其一：　　傑閣侵歷漢，宸章煥壁奎。　　內延頒寳宴，中使揭　題。　　信誓山河固，恩寵雨露低。　　寒儒倚天祿，目斷五雲西。　　其二：　　功掩蕭何第，名越崔氏堂。　　孤忠扶社稷，一德契穹蒼。　　金碧飛羣外，　虬結綺旁。　　落成紛燕賀，弱羽得高翔。　　很明顯，這兩首詩乃是秦檜作的。「信誓山河固」一句是秦檜自誇其屈己和敵的大功，「一德契穹蒼」句更指明了是秦檜的書閣。而秦氏這書閣之得名，又正是因爲宋高宗親自替他寫了一個「一德格天」的扁額之故。李心傳的建炎以來絜年要錄卷一五四記此事云：　　〔紹興十五年冬十月〕乙亥，上書秦檜賜第書閣曰「一德格天之閣」，遺中使就第賜宴。仍賜檜靑羅蓋，塗金從物，如蔡京王輔例。宋會要稿崇儒類御書門也記此事云：　　〔紹興十五年〕十月三日，上遣中使賜太師秦檢第御書閣榜，曰「一德格天之閣」。仍就賜御筵。　　這兩段記載中都說宋高宗特派「中使」賜秦檜以御書閣榜，而詩中則有「中使揭藍題」之句；記載中都說宋高宗又就秦檜的賜第中賜御筵，而詩中則有「內廷頒寳宴」之句；宋高宗所寫的是「一德格天之閣」，而詩中則有「一德契穹蒼」之句。其事其詩，處處都能「筍鬥鍵合」，再加以「信誓山河固」和「寒儒倚天祿」等句，無一不可以證明右二詩乃是秦檜在接受到上項恩寵之後呈獻給宋高宗的謝恩詩，和辛稼軒實在是風馬牛不相及，不知辛啓泰何以竟至誤收於稼軒集抄存之內。秦檜詩文，世問並無傳本，辛啓泰在此兩詩之下也沒有註明出典，想來是從永樂大典中誤收的吧。　　十年前，當我重新校輯稼軒詩文的時候，我就很懷疑這兩首詩不是稼軒的作品。因爲在稼軒一生中並沒有受到過內廷頒宴和皇帝賜寫樓閣匾額的各項恩寵，而且，稼軒自歸宋之後，直至老死，始終以爲對金人並無信義可講，因而也始終是主張乘機對金用兵的人，自然不會說出「信誓山河固」的話來。然而，對於證據如此分明的兩首詩，不知當時何以沒有論定其爲秦檜之作，也竟收錄於稼軒詩文抄存之內。現在想來，眞是萬分的疏失。　　辛稼軒的一生，忠義奮發，慷慨激昂；而秦檜的一生，對內則竊弄威柄，殘民害政，對外則婢膝奴顏，喪權辱國；一忠一姦，一賢一侫，正是一個極分明的比照。不料在他們身死數百年後，他們的作品竟至被人相　雜，魚目混珠，經百數十年而無人加以辨析，對於稼軒，這幾乎可以說是一個侮辱。這樣想來，我自己對於前項疏失更覺得是一椿不可　恕的罪過了。（三十七年四月一日夜一時。）社會服務兵役釋疑（四）　上海市民政局第三科撰述　　凡根據以上各條裏面的任何一條由請，除塡具申請書，並應繳附規　證明文件，向該管保辦公處申請外，尤應注意在政府規定日期申請，卅六年度是三十六年七月十五日起至八月五日或補繳證件，（依令發各區公佈日期先後爲準並不一律）如過期即認爲自願放棄權益，不再補行由請。不過原因若是發生在規定申請期後，可以隨時申請，不受時間限制。反之，如若申請已經核准過後，而原因消滅，雖經核准緩征召或免禁役，均應取消其資格。如果原因消滅不履行呈報或僞造申請原因，經人檢舉査明屬實的，即認爲逃避兵役，依照妨害兵役罪條例送司法機關法辦。　　又三十六年度申請，經審査補證件或遭　回的，如確有申請原因，可於四月底前，檢附合法證件，送交該管保辦公處層轉本局轉送複核，如再逾期即認爲自願放棄權益，不得再行補證。希望免役禁役及緩征召壯丁注意。服務簡訊　　代打華文本報讀者范明德君，自　華文打字機，願於課餘之暇，擔任華文打字，聘者請函寳昌路廿八號范君洽。　　王慶人君，交大機械系四年級生，願任家庭敎師，聘者請函交大西齋一四七室。　　醫書出讓鄙人是一個淸寒學生，生活頗感困難，所以只得將家裏所存之書，　愛出賣。計（一）傷寒論輯義按一部（綫裝本分訂六册）惲　樵著，（二）　熱辨惑一册章巨應著，（三）衷中參西的醫論一册戚肖波著。如願購者請開明價格，逕函本市延平路葉家宅雁村四十六號王君治。　　徵聘敎師本報讀者徐君，徵求幼稚園主任敎師一人，須師範畢業，有教學經騐，並擅長鋼琴者爲合格。應繳者，請逕電（〇二）六一三二九與徐君接洽。電信問答　上海電信局主答　　〔中華路顧良田君問〕貴局播送之鐘聲是否準確？　　〔答〕本局所播鐘聲，係從外灘江海關大鐘轉播，在該處裝置麥克風，接至中央室，由電話綫傳各營業處　　放送，故絕對準確無誤。　　〔小北門鼎馨齋香燭號問〕敝號戰前本設有五一號公用電話，　因　事關係拆去，勝利以來，已四次具函申請恢復，迄未照准，現有下列疑問數點，煩請解答。（一）須用何種方式申請，才能生效？　以前所有遺留之電話綫及公用電話瓷牌，可否作爲裝置之證明。（三）假使核准，需裝置費用若千？　　〔答〕（一）公川電話申請手續可由用戶具函送局聲明裝置原因，本局得參酌機　容量綫路情形統籌辦理。（二）目前因機件缺乏，戰前用戶尙難普渠裝復。（三）裝置費用除規定者外，專用材料費用須視綫路情形再行核定。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Holds its Fourth Meeting: Chairman Personally Delivers Political Report, Ample Preparations Made in Economy and Military</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chairman Chiang attended the National Assembly at 10 a.m. on the 9th, giving a concise report on the current economic and military situation. He also reiterated the important tasks of this session of the Assembly, urging everyone to fulfill their responsibilities and quickly accomplish the mission. The sixth group of the Presidium was on duty for the Assembly on the morning of the 9th, chaired by Zuo Shunsheng. The meeting commenced at 10 a.m. sharp. Secretary-General Hong reported that 2,597 delegates had registered, with 2,395 delegates in attendance. After Chairman Zuo Shunsheng announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Hong invited Chairman Chiang to deliver his report. The Chairman, dressed in military uniform, entered the venue from the right rear of the platform. All the delegates in the audience spontaneously rose to pay their respects, applauding to welcome him. Chairman Chiang then proceeded to the podium to begin his report, which lasted for one hour and thirty-five minutes, eliciting applause more than twenty times. When analyzing the current economic and military situation, the Chairman used figures as concrete evidence, explaining that the economy and military were not in the crisis rumored outside. The government had made ample preparations and was determined in both finance and military affairs. No matter how the communist bandits propagandized, they would not be able to shake the fundamental foundation. The Chairman stated: Currently, the silver and gold stored in the Central Bank are worth approximately US$110 million, which can be used to recover all the legal tender. In addition, the foreign exchange position is worth US$180 million. Adding the US$400 million from the sale of state-owned industries and the US$463 million in American aid to be received soon, the total should be over US$1 billion. With such a solid financial foundation, there is no danger. Chairman Chiang concluded his military report by saying: There is absolute certainty of victory in suppressing the bandits. Within half a year, at least the area south of the Yellow River can be cleared. The Chairman particularly emphasized that this Assembly was convened in an extraordinary period, and its task was to implement constitutionalism and build the nation. It should remove obstacles to constitutionalism. The Assembly is being watched by people at home and abroad, and the communist bandits are repeatedly trying to sabotage it. Therefore, all delegates should strive to win the people's respect and trust, and not argue solely over the acquisition of power. They must not make a laughingstock of themselves for the communist bandits to exploit in their propaganda schemes. Finally, the Chairman stated that he hoped all delegates would review what he had reported. After the report, the Chairman left the venue, and the entire audience once again stood and applauded to pay their respects. Chairman Zuo Shunsheng then announced the adjournment of the meeting. When Chairman Chiang was reporting, government officials were all in attendance to listen, including Madam Chiang, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Zhangjia, Xu Fulin, Yu Hongjun, Jiang Menglin, and others.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Chairman's Report: Encouraging National Assembly Delegates to Work Together with One Heart to Eliminate Obstacles and Lay the Foundation for Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The original text of Chairman Chiang's report at the National Assembly on the morning of the 9th is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the opening of this session of the National Assembly, it has been more than ten days. In these ten days, all the delegates have worked diligently for the country, which has enabled the Assembly to achieve many successes. Today, I would like to express my gratitude to all of you on behalf of the government. We are convening the National Assembly and implementing constitutional government in this extraordinary period of rampant banditry and social unrest. I think all the delegates must know that the significance of convening this Assembly is different from ordinary gatherings. It is a very important gathering. The first task of our Assembly, of course, is to implement constitutional government, lay a good foundation for constitutional government, and complete the construction of the country. And if we want the country's construction to be completed and the implementation of constitutional government to be smooth, we must first eliminate the obstacles to constitutionalism and eliminate the communist bandits who are destroying the foundation of the country and hindering the country's construction. All the delegates have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people of the whole country to participate in this extraordinary Assembly. They should face reality, face the enemy, be united, and work together to eliminate the communist bandits and ensure the implementation of constitutional government. I believe that if our National Assembly can successfully complete its tasks, it will be equivalent to increasing our national army's strength by one hundred divisions for the completion of the suppression of the rebellion and the stability of the country. And the contributions of all the delegates to the nation and the people will surely be immortalized in the history of Chinese constitutional government in the future.</p>
<p>The issue that all the delegates are most concerned about today is naturally the current situation of the country, especially the military and economic situation. Here, I would first like to make one point, that is, at this time of high prices and difficult lives for the majority of the people, and when the communist bandits are constantly spreading rumors, threatening, and disrupting the hearts of the people throughout the country, the general public does not recognize the situation of the country, cannot distinguish between true benefits and harms, and thus shakes their confidence in the future of the nation and feels anxious about the fate of the country. In fact, this is entirely due to being poisoned by the propaganda of the communist bandits and becoming prisoners of the communist bandits in spirit, which is exactly what the ancient saying "frightening each other with the ghost of Boyou" means, spreading rumors and creating panic. This is exactly what the communist bandits are seeking. We must start from the fundamental point of view to understand the real situation and measure the long-term future of the nation and the people. Now I will explain the issues that you are all concerned about with facts:</p>
<p>Total Amount of Legal Tender Issued: Less Than Seventy Trillion; Total Value of Gold, Silver, Foreign Exchange and Marketable Materials Stored by the Government: Over 700 Million US Dollars, More Than Three Times the Legal Tender</p>
<p>First of all, what I want to explain to everyone is the economic issue. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, due to the destruction of the communist bandits everywhere, traffic has been blocked, industries and mines have been shut down, the majority of the people have lived in poverty, and production has shrunk, forming a phenomenon of economic imbalance. This is a fact, and we cannot but admit that the current economic situation is indeed quite serious. But has our Chinese economy reached the point where it is beyond salvation, as the communist bandits have claimed, and is about to collapse? Or are the various chaotic and uneasy phenomena in our economy today caused by our own psychology? To answer this question, today I can frankly tell everyone the figures of the national finance and economy. As of the end of last month, the total amount of legal tender we issued was less than seventy trillion yuan. However, the total value of the silver and gold currently stored by our government is approximately US$110 million. The total amount of foreign exchange stored by the Central Bank and other national banks and bureaus reaches US$180 million. The two items total approximately US$290 million. And last month, the State Council decided to allocate a portion of the factories of the Resources Committee, the China Textile Company, a portion of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, enemy and puppet properties, and compensation materials to the Central Bank, which can be marketed at any time, totaling approximately US$400 million. The two total US$700 million. If calculated at the current exchange rate, it can offset more than three times the total amount of legal tender issued. And the aid loan recently passed by the US Congress is not included. From this, it can be seen that our legal tender has very sufficient reserves and the financial foundation is very solid. The consolidation of the financial foundation proves that our economic foundation has not been shaken. The current panic and the belief that the economy is about to collapse are entirely due to being influenced by the propaganda of the communist bandits and their tools, losing confidence in the country, and thus creating a panic psychology that harms oneself. All of you will be able to dispel this unnecessary doubt by listening to my responsible report today. Since last year, I have been distracted by military guidance and have not given enough consideration to finance. As a result, some negligence has been inevitable in the methods and techniques of execution. This is my responsibility, but we have this foundation and we will be able to save the economic crisis and strive for economic recovery. I hope all the delegates will work together with one heart and one mind, trust the government, stabilize the hearts of the people, and take the lead in diligence and thrift for the people of the whole country. Then I believe that the economic foundation will become more stable day by day in the future, and the economic situation will improve day by day.</p>
<p>Explaining the Military Situation and Correcting Misconceptions</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about the military situation. Now everyone sees the rampancy of the communist bandits and thinks it is a military failure. In fact, this is a misconception. It should be known that the real military action of the national army to suppress the bandits only began with the capture of Yan'an in March last year. Prior to this, the national army's response to the communist bandits' invasion was merely passive self-defense. The national army's contact with the communist bandits has only been a year and a half now. In this year and a half, the national army has achieved two important strategic goals. The first is to consolidate the key points of the national army so that the communist bandits cannot obtain external assistance. The national army recovered Chengde and Zhangjiakou in the 35th year of the Republic, and Yantai in September last year, completely isolating the communist bandits' land and sea external communications. This is the achievement of this goal. The second is to occupy the location of the communist bandits' headquarters, which is the recovery of Yan'an in March last year, which caused the communist bandits to lose their political base and had to flee east and west, becoming bandits. In order to achieve these two major goals, the national army certainly had to pay a considerable price and suffer considerable sacrifices. However, our sacrifices have important significance and have already dealt a major blow to the bandit army, so we cannot be considered a failure. This is what everyone must understand. Now I will explain the situation of each battlefield separately as follows:</p>
<p>Future Strategy in the Northeast: Eliminate the Main Force of the Communist Bandits</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Northeast. Now the area occupied by the national army in the Northeast has shrunk, and the traffic has been cut off. This is because the bandit army has formed an advantage in military strength. Since the national army has been fighting in the Northeast, it has lost seven divisions before and after. However, except for the reorganized 49th Division, these seven national divisions are all temporarily formed three-regiment units. As for the regular national army, there is no major loss. In particular, the Second Army, the 53rd Army, the Sixth Army, the 71st Army, the 93rd Army, the New First Army, and the New Sixth Army can all stand firm and are healthy and undamaged. However, the strength of the bandits in the Northeast has indeed increased by one-third compared to before. Therefore, the situation seems quite serious. But as long as we hold on to several important strongholds such as Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou, we will surely be able to guarantee that the Northeast will always be our national territory. These few strongholds must be held firmly, and they can certainly be held firmly. We must know that the meaning of failure refers to the elimination of the "basic strength," and the current situation of the national army in the Northeast is based on strategic changes, not due to the weakening of the basic strength. The past strategy focused on recovering lost territory, and the future strategy focuses on eliminating the entire main force of the communist bandits. In order to adapt to the new strategy, we cannot disperse our forces for comprehensive control, and our determination to recover the Northeast will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The National Army in the North China and Northwest Battlefields Cultivates Fighting</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about North China. Since the fall of Shijiazhuang, the 7th Division and the 12th Division of the Third Army have been eliminated. This is the first time our important city has fallen, and it is certainly a major loss for us. But except for the Third Army, all other troops in North China are constantly being replenished and strengthened. In particular, since Commander-in-Chief Fu has unified command, the armies in North China under his leadership are growing day by day. In the near future, I believe that this battlefield will certainly show good results. Therefore, we cannot judge the success or failure of the entire bandit suppression military based on the gains and losses of one place at one time.</p>
<p>As for the Northwest, the death of Liu Kan, commander of the 29th Army, in the recent Yichuan battle in Shaanxi was indeed a major loss for the national army. However, in terms of the entire military strength in Shaanxi, at most one-sixth has been lost. The remaining divisions and independent brigades under the First Army are still complete and healthy and are continuing to work hard to fight. And the 22nd Army, which defended Yulin twice and repelled the enemy's siege, is fighting bravely with fewer troops than the enemy, and is fighting on the spot, cooperating to exert our combat power. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem in ensuring the Northwest.</p>
<p>The Rampancy of the Communist Bandits in Central China is a Forced Flight</p>
<p>Furthermore, let's talk about Central China. In the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, it has been greatly disturbed by the rampancy of the communist bandits for several months. But it should be known that this is a forced flight of the communist bandits, not their original purpose. I can tell you that the communist bandits' disturbance of Central China will certainly prolong the time for suppressing the bandits a little, but the communist bandits' conspiracy will never succeed. The main purpose of the communist bandits was originally to occupy North China, but because the national army entered Shandong in June last year to suppress the bandits, Chen Yi's bandit troops could not resist, and planned to divide into two groups, one group fled back to northern Jiangsu, and one group took the road to western Shandong and fled to Hebei. However, at that time, it was raining continuously, and the Yellow River and the Grand Canal were rising sharply, and they could not cross them secretly. And after Liu Bocheng's group crossed the Yellow River to support Chen Yi, they were repeatedly intercepted by the national army, making it impossible for them to flee back. So they made the best of a bad bargain and fled to the Yellow River flood area and the Dabie Mountain area. The Dabie Mountain group was Liu Bocheng's troops. Everyone knows that Liu Bocheng is the most ferocious bandit leader among the communist bandits. At that time, he took six columns and fled into the Dabie Mountain area, vainly trying to use the Dabie Mountain area as a base, threatening the capital in the east and threatening Wuhan in the west, and clamoring that he would cross the Yangtze River to the south in May this year and enter Sichuan to the west in August. But after Minister Bai sat in Jiujiang and commanded the national army to launch a fierce suppression, his strength in the Dabie Mountain area is now only three or four scattered regiments. The rest cannot stand, and have all fled back to the Yellow River flood area, and are fleeing around everywhere. At this time, the people of Shandong and Henan certainly feel pain and hope that the national army will rescue them. But everyone should know that I will certainly eliminate the entire bandit group gathered south of the Yellow River within three to six months.</p>
<p>Mobile Use of Troops to Attack the Communist Army's Conspiracy</p>
<p>I never easily predict military affairs. Since suppressing the bandits, everything I have declared has been achieved as scheduled, such as the recovery of Zhangjiakou and Chengde, the capture of Yan'an, and the sweep of Shandong and Jiaodong. Everything that has been strategically decided has been completed within the time limit. Everyone should trust my plan, strengthen the confidence of victory, and also know that the past strategy was first to ensure the national defense strongholds, which has been completed and achieved, and second to rescue the people, and we had to focus on occupying land. And the future strategy must focus on defeating the main force of the bandit army. In order to attack the communist army's conspiracy to contain our army, some locations sometimes have to be temporarily abandoned so that we can concentrate our forces, use them mobilely, and annihilate the main force of the bandit army. When this strategy is implemented, some areas may inevitably have to endure temporary pain, but they will certainly be rescued by the group army sooner or later.

<h3>Fu Zuoyi is Alarmed: The National Assembly Decides to Send Condolences</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Huaibei Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi was slightly injured in an accident when Ji Ningfei was flying on a plane. The National Assembly delegates are extremely concerned and decided to send a telegram of condolences. The telegram has been drafted by the Secretariat and will be submitted to the Assembly for approval before being sent.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Chronicle: A Day of Calm Seas</h3>
<p>Our Special Report (April 9th, Nanjing)</p>
<p>It has been sunny and warm for days, and emotions have been agitated in the meeting place. Many procedural issues have been caught up in the entanglement of emotions. The eccentricity and chaos shown in the meeting on the 8th can be said to have reached their peak. Fortunately, the wind and rain lasted all night, and on the morning of the 9th, the fog was misty and the temperature dropped sharply by twenty degrees. Everything in the meeting place also calmed down. The entire process of the morning and afternoon meetings on the 9th was generally quite smooth. In the morning, Chairman Chiang attended and gave a report. His consistent prestige and frankness made the delegates unanimously convinced and listened attentively throughout. The meeting in the afternoon to discuss the rules of procedure and the organizational regulations of the proposal review committee was also harmonious and relaxed. The east wind was weak, and it wanted to frown but then stopped. On the morning of the 9th, everyone was excited about Chairman Chiang's attendance and report. Of the 2,579 delegates, only 202 were absent. In addition to Madam Chiang, there were a large number of government officials on the podium. After Hong Lanyou announced twice that Chairman Chiang of the National Government would deliver a policy report, the entire audience stood up, and the Chairman walked to the podium amidst applause, emphasizing the extraordinary task of the National Assembly. Then there was sincere applause, shaking the entire building of the Assembly Hall. Subsequently, he began the economic and military report. Chairman Chiang's one-and-a-half-hour report created order in the morning meeting, and his final thoughts and wishes simultaneously generated the effect of resolving entanglements in the fourth general assembly in the afternoon. At 3:40 p.m., Chairman Gan Naiguang, with the assistance of Hong Lanyou, began to continue discussing the rules. The people who stirred up the storm the day before were all silent. Only a few, because Gan Naiguang talked too much and became more and more entangled in the explanation, caused a small wave. The second half of the sixty-six rules of procedure and all nine organizational regulations of the proposal review committee were smoothly processed after Hong Lanyou read them out, either by voting to amend them or by maintaining the original plan without objection. Of all the meetings that the National Assembly has held, there has never been one as smooth as the fourth meeting on the 9th.</p>
<p>The Assembly opened on March 29th and has held more than ten meetings so far, but it has only just finished processing the issues related to the meeting procedures. People are somewhat tired. At the end of the afternoon meeting on the 9th, only 1,146 delegates were present.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The afternoon Assembly proceeded smoothly, but the procedures on the podium were slightly chaotic. The number of seats in the gallery of the Assembly is limited, and applicants have to be strictly restricted. Three delegates can only introduce one person to the gallery. When delegates are asked to sign, seven out of ten people tell them: "Old brother, you are one step late, I just signed once." Someone asked a certain delegate why he had no high opinions. He sighed and said: "Who still has the courage to speak, even Professor Zhou Gengsheng was booed down."</p>
<h3>Agenda of the First National Assembly: Starting Today, the General Assembly Will Review National Affairs; Presidents and Vice Presidents to be Elected on the 15th and 17th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The agenda of the first National Assembly will be submitted for discussion at the fifth General Assembly on the 10th. The Presidium of the General Assembly has made this decision. The agenda includes four parts: (1) Reviewing national affairs, (2) Reviewing proposals, (3) Discussing proposals, (4) Electing the President and Vice President. The Presidium met at 8 p.m. on the evening of the 9th, chaired by Zhou Zhongyue, and planned to hold a General Assembly on the 10th, 12th, and 13th for three days to review national affairs. The 11th will be a rest day. Xue Dubi and Bai Chongxi have been nominated to serve as the chairpersons of the General Assembly on the morning and afternoon of the 10th. Regarding the election of the President and Vice President, the draft proposed by the Secretariat is: The President will be elected on the 15th, and the Vice President will be elected on the 17th. The names of the candidates will be announced three days in advance. The Presidium did not make a specific decision during the meeting. The original plan was to have one nomination form for each unit for the nomination of the Vice President. In order to avoid abuses, the Presidium decided to use individuals as units, and each delegate will be issued one nomination form for the Vice President for free nomination.</p>
<h3>The Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly have been Discussed and Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The fourth General Assembly of the National Assembly was held at 3:40 p.m. on the 9th. The sixth group of the Presidium was on duty, chaired by Gan Naiguang. The draft rules of procedure of the General Assembly and the draft organizational regulations of the proposal review committee were continued to be discussed. Everything was calm and smooth, and all of them were successfully amended and passed. There were fewer speakers than in previous meetings.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves the New Price of Coal</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The new price of coal has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and will be changed from April.

The focus is on the city and the northeast corner of Dongguan. The bandits are making every effort to provide cover, building counter-embankments against the National Army's outer trenches, attempting to open a road to scale the city walls. The struggle for the outer trenches is fierce. Wang Zhen led two brigades from Hancheng across the river to reinforce. All sectors in Linfen are enthusiastically participating in the war. More than 300 cadres, students, police, and constables, along with all the employees of the power plant, have volunteered for service and have joined the ranks.

<p>President Chiang’s Policy Address at the National Assembly (Photo by Our Newspaper)</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<h3>Editorial: Do Not Fail the Expectations of the People and the Government</h3>
<p>-- Following President Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>The National Assembly held its fourth session yesterday. President Chiang himself attended the assembly to give a post-policy report. Although he frankly admitted the seriousness of the current situation, his analysis of the internal economic situation and the military situation indicated not only a solid economic foundation but also an optimistic outlook for the suppression of the rebellion. These frank and honest words can have a tremendous stabilizing effect on the morale within the country. They can eliminate the general public's panic over the economy and their defeatism regarding the military suppression of the rebellion. The communist bandits' various propaganda offensives regarding the economy and military affairs in recent years can thus be defeated without a fight.</p>
<p>We have read President Chiang's speech again and again. Its main points are as follows: (1) Pointing out the tasks of this National Assembly: first, to implement the constitution, so that Chinese politics can steadily step onto the right track of democratic constitutionalism; and second, to eliminate the obstacles to the implementation of the constitution and achieve the task of national construction. (2) Explaining that the current economic foundation is absolutely solid, and using the amount of legal tender issued, the national reserves, and all the materials to prove that the value of legal tender in relation to prices is far below its actual value today. Therefore, the current economic crisis lies in the people's uneasiness about legal tender caused by the communist bandits. (3) Analyzing the current military suppression of the bandits with a firm and sincere tone, expressing confidence that final victory will be achieved. In short, in the Northeast, as long as Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou are in the hands of the National Army, it can be guaranteed that the Northeast will always be ours; the military situation in North China has gradually improved since General Fu Zuoyi took charge; in the Central China war, since Minister Bai went to suppress the bandits in person, the communist bandits have scattered eastward in all directions and have become mere roving bandits, and the communist bandits south of the Yellow River can be eliminated in the short term. (4) Urging the National Assembly representatives to complete the tasks entrusted to them by the National Assembly with extraordinary sincerity, and not to act capriciously and make a laughingstock of themselves, creating propaganda material for the communist bandits.</p>
<p>President Chiang's speech was full of enthusiasm and sincerity. Not to mention the National Assembly representatives present, who were deeply moved, even we ordinary people who read President Chiang's speech in the newspaper felt great comfort and believed that the uneasiness in the past was nothing more than "fussing over nothing." As long as the whole country, both the government and the people, can, under the leadership of the enlightened leader, take the same steps towards a peaceful, democratic, unified, and strong path, we will surely be able to fulfill our historical mission. The convening of this National Assembly is precisely to implement the constitution, and in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, to elect the president and vice president, so as to take the first step in leading our country's politics towards democratic constitutionalism. The people's hope for this National Assembly lies in completing this major task. The National Assembly representatives from all over the country have been entrusted by the people to go to the capital to attend this National Assembly meeting, and the mission they want to accomplish lies in this. Therefore, this National Assembly is "only allowed to succeed, not allowed to fail." It is truly a major key to our country's democratic constitutionalism. Whether it is bright or dark will depend on the outcome of this meeting.</p>
<p>However, this National Assembly has been in session for two weeks since it opened on March 29. Looking at the situation of the National Assembly meeting, the order in the venue does not seem to be very good. Sometimes representatives rush to speak or pound the table and shout abuse; other times representatives hiss and ridicule, or applaud for no reason, so that the meeting procedures cannot proceed. For the first six or seven days, in order to elect the presidium, it remained in the "preparatory meeting" stage for several days; and when the formal meeting was held, it almost caused an uproar because of the discussion of the rules of procedure. Although these phenomena are unavoidable in the parliaments of democratic countries, it is not a good way to quarrel and make trouble every day so that the meeting cannot proceed according to the scheduled date. Moreover, gathering two or three thousand representatives in the capital costs the government as much as 7 billion yuan a day, which is a waste of manpower and money. Some newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai have already made subtle criticisms of this situation of the National Assembly. President Chiang's speech also earnestly advised the representatives not to make a laughingstock of themselves, causing those who hate us to rejoice and creating propaganda material for the communist bandits. We also sincerely hope that the National Assembly representatives will deeply reflect, recognize the mission entrusted to them, quickly concentrate their will, and complete the tasks of this National Assembly as scheduled, so as not to fail the expectations of the voters. There are still two problems facing the National Assembly at present. We would like to say a word to the National Assembly representatives on these two matters.</p>
<p>The first is the issue of amending the constitution. According to Articles 27 and 174 of the constitution, this National Assembly can amend the constitution, but no legal or political system is absolutely superior or inferior. Our constitution has not yet been implemented, and there are no facts to prove that it needs to be amended. Moreover, the constitution should have stability and should not be easily amended. This is a generally recognized principle by constitutional scholars. Recalling the debate on the draft constitution at the National Assembly in December two years ago, it took countless efforts to pass this relatively democratic and progressive draft constitution, which became the current "Constitution of the Republic of China that is being implemented." If it is significantly amended without being implemented, then the constitution-making work of the previous year would have been in vain. Furthermore, in terms of the current political environment, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the general non-party members have all expressed their opposition to this National Assembly amending the constitution. If the opinions of the minority parties are not respected, it will inevitably cause new disputes. Therefore, although we acknowledge that the National Assembly has the power to amend the constitution, we do not regard the constitutional provisions as sacred and inviolable; but we oppose this National Assembly making significant amendments to the constitution. If you want to expand the powers of the National Assembly or restore the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution, we believe that these are all inappropriate.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of the National Assembly reviewing national affairs. The rules of procedure passed the day before yesterday have added a clause: "When the National Assembly is in session, it may listen to the government's policy reports, review national affairs, and make inquiries and suggestions." On the surface, this clause seems to contradict Article 27 of the constitution; but in fact it is not so. Because the National Assembly is an organ that exercises political power and may exercise the power of initiative, only because Article 27 has a "proviso" that the National Assembly cannot exercise the power of initiative before half of the counties and cities in the country have exercised the power of initiative and referendum. However, we see that democratic countries in Europe and the United States that adopt a bicameral system, whether it is the Senate or the House of Representatives, have the right to listen to government policy reports and ask questions of the government. In addition, this National Assembly is being held at a time when the situation is most serious, and it is even more necessary to discuss national affairs. However, discussing national affairs does not necessarily have to be done in the assembly; it can also be done outside the assembly. In any case, it is a nature of exchanging opinions, you can ask the government questions, and you can also provide the government with suggestions, but you cannot pass any resolutions, and even if there are resolutions, they do not have the power to bind the government, but can only be provided to the authorities for reference.</p>
<p>The above explanation is entirely based on legal principles. If the representatives can remain calm and respect legal principles, then this National Assembly can proceed smoothly and complete its important tasks as scheduled, without failing the expectations of the people and the government.</p>
<h3>President's Report to the National Assembly: Elimination of Bandit Troops Does Not Diminish National Army Strength; Bandit Casualties Exceed National Army Threefold</h3>
<p>Since the start of the bandit suppression war, the National Army has indeed lost seventeen divisions. This includes some poorly trained provisional troops, as well as troops that have been fighting for many years. Due to the negligence and incompetence of a few generals, or poor management, and failure to maintain secrecy, these troops have failed. The loss of these troops is tantamount to self-elimination, and can be said to have caused no loss to the overall strength of the National Army. Now, the truly well-trained National Army is not only not weakened, but is becoming stronger day by day. As for the losses of the National Army, they are about 10% of the total, and 80% of the replenishment has been completed in the past few months. Everyone should not only listen to the propaganda of the bandits, only see the 10% of the troops that have been lost, and not see the 90% of the sound and strong troops. In fact, since the bandit suppression operations, although the National Army has suffered losses, the losses of the bandit army have been several times greater than those of the National Army. Here I can cite detailed figures for comparison. In 1946, the number of casualties in the National Army was more than 210,000, and the number of casualties in the bandit army was more than 520,000. The number of National Army soldiers captured was 23,000, and the number of bandit army soldiers captured was 54,000. In 1947, the number of casualties in the National Army was more than 410,000, and the number of casualties in the bandit army was more than 1,600,000. The number of National Army soldiers captured was 120,000, and the number of bandit army soldiers captured was 116,000. In total, the number of bandit army soldiers killed, wounded, and captured exceeds the National Army by more than three times. Everyone must not only look at the propaganda of the bandits, and ignore the fact that the National Army's heavy sacrifices have already obtained a price more than three times greater. In particular, the loyalty and martyrdom of our senior generals, who fought to the last man, and then died heroically by committing suicide. For example, Liu Kan, commander of the 29th Army, Lu Ying, commander of the 35th Army, Dai Ziqi, commander of the 69th Division, and Zhang Lingfu, commander of the 74th Division, fully demonstrated the spirit of our National Revolutionary Army of not yielding in the face of danger and sacrificing oneself for righteousness, and showed the long-standing and lofty spiritual strength of our nation. The stories of these martyrs are all worthy of praise and tears. There are indeed facts of poor military discipline and corruption in our National Army, but everyone should not indiscriminately lump everything together. Just because one officer or soldier is like this, misunderstand that all the officers and soldiers are like this. You must know that we have so many troops, and since the 20th year of the Republic of China, we have been suppressing bandits, and after eight years of resistance against Japan, we have continued to suppress bandits. With such a long and protracted war, it is of course not easy to make all the troops disciplined. I can say that today, the vast majority of the National Army generals are law-abiding, do not hesitate to sacrifice, and can be persevering, using the few to defeat the many. No matter how much the bandit army brags about its achievements and slanders the National Army, in fact, in addition to the troops that have been eliminated and lost, there are still many troops standing firm, holding their positions, and actively looking for bandits to fight.</p>
<p>Everyone Must Not Neglect the Communist Bandits' Conspiracy to Stir Up Discord</p>
<p>One more point that everyone must not neglect is that the communist bandits' consistent conspiracy is to try to stir up discord and divide our National Army. They falsely claim that some of our troops are central army troops, and some are local army troops. They have never discovered the strength of their so-called local army troops. However, in this bandit suppression operation, these troops have all demonstrated a full fighting spirit. They are neither able to be stirred up or shaken by the communist bandits, nor are they something that the communist bandits' despicable mentality could have anticipated. For example, the troops in Chahar and Suiyuan, everyone knows, are the most brave and good at fighting, and deeply supported by the people. The Shanxi army stubbornly defended Linfen, resisting more than three times their number of enemies for more than ten days, standing firm and unyielding. And the Guangdong troops fighting in the Yangtze River area, the Hunan troops in the Northeast, the Guangxi troops in the Dabie Mountains, and the Sichuan troops in Central China are all full of fighting spirit and vigorous in spirit. As for the Ningxia troops in Shaanxi and the Qinghai troops in eastern Gansu, they can all maintain their historical glory and give full play to their bandit suppression specialties, creating good results. This is enough to prove that after eight years of resistance against Japan, all the troops in China have been influenced by the national spirit, sharing life and death as one, united as one, and there is no longer any regional distinction to speak of. It can be said that today, not only all the officers and soldiers in the country swear not to coexist with the communist bandits, but all the people in the country are also united against the enemy, identifying this gang of bandits who betray the nation as the only enemy that must be suppressed. We use national righteousness to deal with national traitors, and national unity to deal with class dictatorship. Where right and wrong lie is where success and failure are judged. Now, the number and designation of communist bandits in the customs have indeed increased. To achieve final victory in the future, it is natural that we must go through arduous struggles. However, the expansion of the communist bandits' forces is only coercing strong men from the bandit areas to fight without training. If we can work hard according to a consistent strategy, I, based on my experience of commanding troops in combat for more than 20 years, and observing the actual military situation, am indeed very optimistic about the bandit suppression military affairs. As long as our compatriots across the country are not shaken by the communist bandits' propaganda, recognize the truth, strengthen their confidence, strengthen military-civilian cooperation, and improve self-defense organizations, then there is no doubt that we will achieve final victory. After you have heard my report, you will know that the foundation of the country is absolutely secure, and there is no need to be afraid.</p>
<p>Hope Representatives Fulfill the Responsibilities Entrusted by the People</p>
<p>Finally, I want to explain my hope for the Assembly. The most important task for you representatives to participate in the Assembly is to implement the Constitution, establish the scale and system of constitutional government, and at the same time, we have a more urgent task, which is to save the people and relieve the people's current greatest pain. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am the Chairman of the National Government, but I am also a member of the people. Today, I am pleading on behalf of the people, asking you representatives to work together to focus your spirit and eyes, face our people's common enemy, the communist bandits, and contribute all our intelligence and wisdom to lay the foundation for the country, quell the civil strife, and save our compatriots who are in dire straits. Therefore, this National Assembly is a National Assembly for implementing the Constitution, and it is also a National Assembly for saving the country and the people. You representatives must know that the communist bandits are the most insidious and vicious bandits and brigands in Chinese history, and are unprecedented rebels of the country. Today, we can only carry forward our revolutionary spirit and national integrity to quell the disasters and save the crisis. The current struggle is indeed more difficult than the war of resistance against Japan. However, this is a war between good and evil, right and wrong. Everything the communist bandits are doing today is destroying ethics, obliterating humanity, and violating the spirit of our Chinese nation. Even if they are rampant for a while, they will eventually fail completely. You representatives must be mindful of the precarious situation of the country today, and you must know that since the convocation of our National Assembly, the communist bandits have been plotting to sabotage us all the time, hoping that we will fail. Every word and deed in the Assembly must be done with great caution, and we must not give the communist bandits an excuse to slander and ridicule us. You representatives must, on the one hand, recognize your own position and powers, and fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to you by the people of the whole country, and at the same time, you must recognize that the current situation is a very extraordinary period, and it is not a time to discuss principles leisurely. Therefore, when we deal with all the problems, we must adhere to the spirit of the extraordinary period, which must be simple and quick in order to buy time and save the country. This Assembly brings together 3,000 representatives from all over the country, which is not only an unprecedented event in Chinese history, but also a key to the rise and fall of the country in the future. Now, the whole world is watching to see the outcome of this Assembly. The success of the Assembly is the success of the entire country. Therefore, when we deal with any problems during the Assembly, we must concentrate our will, be concise and avoid complexity, so that the meeting can proceed smoothly, and we must not focus on details, argue endlessly, and fail to make a decision. The Song people said, "If the discussion is not settled, the soldiers have already crossed the river." It can be seen that a lack of unity of will is enough to delay national affairs. Therefore, I believe that the simpler the procedures for the country, the better, and the faster the progress of the agenda, the better. This is what I want to offer to the Assembly.</p>
<p>The above is the general political report I made to the Assembly on behalf of the government for your representatives to review, and I hope you will not hesitate to give your advice. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>US Pushes West German Plan - Suggests Establishing West German Government Early - Three Powers Negotiate Matters of Occupied Zone Merger</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Reliable source: The United States has suggested establishing a West German government in one year, divided into five stages. Experts from six countries, including Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, will discuss the German issue in Berlin starting on the 8th, with this as the main theme. The five stages specified in the plan are: (1) Organize a temporary government including the current British-American merged zone and the French zone; (2) Adjust the boundaries between the states; (3) Elect a constitutional parliament; (4) The parliament drafts a constitution; (5) Establish a formal new German government. This US plan was drawn up based on recent developments in Berlin and can be regarded as the latest formal attitude of Washington and the US occupation authorities in Germany. People here believe that France, before the meeting, did not intend to change its previously announced position, that is, before first resolving the two issues related to French security, namely the future political structure of Germany and the international control of the Ruhr, it could not reach a decision on merging the French zone with the British-American zone. Reliable sources said that the British representative participating in the six-nation talks in Berlin has given broad support to the American initiative to revise the timetable for merging the three zones. Observers also believe that in view of the recent crisis in Berlin, the United States needs to step up the political and economic organization of West Germany as part of the overall plan for the recovery of Western Europe. In addition, the United States believes that if steps are not taken to establish a West German temporary government, it will inevitably face the established facts of the Eastern country and government. Therefore, the United States has decided to accelerate the promotion of its plan for West Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The US plan to establish a West German government within one year has aroused suspicion among French officials. They believe that if the US plan is as rumored by the outside world, the election of the West German constitutional assembly is likely to cause the most feared central government in France. The French representative, Mauville, who participated in the six-nation expert negotiations, is expected to firmly oppose the establishment of a West German central government and will insist on maintaining a federal-based government that allows the states to retain strong powers. France also believes that the government set up in Frankfurt is not as appealing as the government set up in Berlin. Mauville will represent the French government in asking Britain and the United States not to fall into the trap of the Soviet Union and give the Soviet Union an excuse to establish a German government in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] President Truman today declined to comment on reports that the United States has proposed a five-point plan to establish a West German government within one year.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that representatives from Britain, the United States, and France will meet in London in the second half of this month to resume discussions on the issue of organizing West Germany on a self-sufficient basis. The British Cabinet met today to discuss the German issue. It can be asserted that Britain does not intend to make any concessions on its policy towards Germany.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently solemnly denied the French report that Foreign Secretary Bevin will go to Berlin next week to announce the establishment of West Germany. The London report issued by the French said that if the Soviet Union continues to resist the Allied Control Council, the West German government will be announced.</p>
<h3>Britain Dissatisfied with Soviet Military Commander's Reply - Considering Fighter Escorts - US and France Will Take Similar Steps</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] After the British military authorities received a reply from Soviet Military Commander Sokolovsky refusing to provide written guarantees not to interfere with the air corridor, Britain and the United States were tonight reconsidering plans to send fighter planes to protect transport planes flying to Berlin. France is expected to take similar steps.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] A British Air Force spokesman said that he was unaware of the TASS report that Britain and the Soviet Union had appointed a joint commission to jointly investigate the incident of British and Soviet planes colliding. The British Air Force has not received any such instructions. According to officials in charge of the Allied aviation authorities, the Soviet TASS statement is neither new nor important, but it may indicate that the Soviet Union will begin to demand changes in aviation rules. For more than a year, the Allies have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with Soviet planes flying into Allied airfields and other violations of regulations, and the Soviet Union has also expressed dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States. This mutual accusation has become a cliché.</p>
<h3>Allied Control Council for Germany - Regular Meeting Not Held</h3>
<p>Soviet Union Approves Establishment of East German Economic Committee</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 9th] US Military Commander for Germany Clay announced today that tomorrow is the day for the Allied Control Council to hold its regular meeting, but since no country has requested a meeting, there will be no meeting at that time. Clay is the rotating chairman of the committee for April. This statement shows that since the Soviet Union recently attempted to force the Western countries to withdraw from Berlin, the hope for four-power cooperation has become increasingly dim. At the same time, it was learned today that the Soviet military authorities have finally approved the establishment of a communist-controlled economic committee in the East German occupation zone.</p>
<h3>Soviet Sentries Fire Shots into the Sky at Border of US and Soviet Occupation Zones</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 9th] Soviet sentries at the border between the US and Soviet occupation zones here suddenly fired several shots into the sky toward the US occupation zone today, allegedly to scare away a group of black market merchants. The US guards called the military police for help. After the military police arrived, they found that the area was peaceful. The US military authorities will not file a protest.</p>
<h3>Allied Commanders in Berlin - Command Meeting - Britain Refutes Soviet Accusations</h3>
<p>Six-Group Meeting Approved to Be Abolished</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] The Berlin Four-Power Joint Command continued to meet today after the Western powers agreed to the Soviet request to abolish the six-nation committee under the command. The Soviet Union originally requested the abolition of eight committees, integrating their tasks into other committees. The Soviet Union requested the dissolution of eight committees, including construction and housing, transportation, economy, social affairs, fuel, property control, de-Nazification, and culture. After concessions from the Western powers, the four powers agreed to retain the economic committee, handed over the issue of the existence of the property control committee to the four-power commanders for handling, and abolished the remaining six committees. During the meeting of the Four-Power Joint Command, British representative Brigadier General Benson accused the Soviet authorities of restricting passenger and freight transport in an attempt to suffocate Berlin. He also reiterated his denial of the Soviet representative Yeliseyev's accusation on April 2 that the Western three powers "looted Berlin," pointing out that the Soviet side wanted to use this as an excuse to implement traffic control.</p>
<h3>Finnish President Broadcasts - Defends the Soviet-Finnish Treaty</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th Broadcasting: Helsinki News, Finnish Prime Minister Paasikivi issued a radio speech today, vigorously defending the Soviet-Finnish Treaty, claiming that through this treaty, Finland can stay out of the disputes between major countries. The Soviet side has an understanding of this goal of Finland.</p>
<h3>Sweden Strengthens Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Stockholm, 8th] Due to the deterioration of the international situation and the Soviet Union's attempt to make Finland join its group, Sweden has taken active measures to strengthen its national defense.</p>
<h3>Civil Administration of Trieste - Will Be Transferred to Italians</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 8th] It was formally announced here: the non-military administrative organs in the British-American zone of the Free Territory of Trieste are scheduled to be handed over at 9:00 AM local time on April 12. At that time, the British and American flags will be taken down, and most positions will be transferred to Italians in the zone. A new administrative organ will be established, with US General Gates serving as the liaison between the military and administrative authorities in the zone. According to authoritative sources in London, all duties of the municipal government departments, except those related to public safety and order, will be handed over to local representatives. Since elections cannot be held under the current provisional regime, these representatives will be appointed by the Allied military government, and the candidates will be responsible and prestigious people in the local area. Apart from the Communist Party, Slovenians and Italians can be elected. It is generally believed that this move by the Allies is the first practical step towards realizing the return of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy.</p>

<h3>US Will Give Strong Support to Western European Five-Nation Alliance - Only the Way to Take It Is Still to Be Finally Determined</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] The planned Western European alliance seems to be able to obtain strong military assistance from the United States to enhance the strength of Western countries to resist Soviet expansion. However, according to official Washington opinion, there are still several major issues to be resolved, and the exact form of this assistance is one of them. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak met with President Truman, Undersecretary of State Lovett, and other US leaders here this week. According to what Spaak told reporters, European countries will later ask the United States for assistance in military and reconstruction aspects. However, the new organization is still in its initial stage, and countries should first consolidate it. State Department and Defense Department officials have studied what form US assistance should take. There are two possibilities. One is that the United States will arm its army with assistance to Western European countries in need of guns, ammunition, airplanes, tanks, etc. The other is to directly conclude a military alliance with the Western European alliance.</p>

<h3>American Lend-Lease Materials - Supplied the Soviet Union During the War</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 10 Billion US Dollars</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 8th] A State Department spokesman declared: US-Soviet negotiations to clear the Soviet Union's $10.6 billion debt under the Lend-Lease Act have made some progress. Agreement has been reached on the main issues, but many issues remain to be resolved. The State Department will publish the original text of the four agreements to aid the Soviet Union, in order to respond to the accusation by Quinn, chairman of the House Surplus Property Committee, that the United States continued to ship military supplies to the Soviet Union after the end of the war in accordance with the secret agreement signed by Roosevelt.</p>
<p>[US News Service, Washington, 8th] The State Department tonight released the content of four wartime draft treaties, according to which the United States, at the request of the Soviet Union, supplied the Soviet Union with millions of tons of non-military materials in addition to purely military equipment in order to carry out the war against Nazi Germany. The materials supplied by the United States under the Lend-Lease program totaled $10.774 billion. The preamble of the document pointed out that the Soviet Union only purchased 2% of the wartime materials with cash. The Lend-Lease figures show that, in addition to purely military materials, the largest shipment to the Soviet Union was nearly 4.5 million short tons of 50 different kinds of food. Among all the materials, the value of industrial machinery and equipment was more than $1 billion. The United States shipped 2.8 million short tons of steel, 802,000 tons of non-ferrous metals, 2.6 million tons of coal products, more than 106 million yards of cotton cloth, more than 3 million tires and inner tubes, and more than 15 million pairs of boots to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Strachey Reduces Report on Japanese Reparations - Ashida Expresses Dissatisfaction - Hopes that the Issue of Islands and Fishing Rights Will Be Resolved by the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Hitoshi told a reporter from the Central News Agency today that Japan currently has many issues waiting to be resolved at the peace conference. One of the most important issues is the issue of the attribution of small islands near Japan. A few days ago, an American reporter said: It is indeed not the case that we recognize the globe as an inseparable part of Japan. What he was referring to were the small islands east of Hokkaido occupied by the Soviet Union after Japan's surrender. Whether in terms of geography, law, or history, each island does not belong to the Kuril Islands, which were assigned to the Soviet Union according to the Allied agreement before the end of the war.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of fishing rights also needs to be resolved at the peace conference. At present, the scope of activity of Japanese fishing boats is very small, and they can only reach a small number of areas in the Bering Sea, the South Pacific, and the Chinese coast. However, because the Japanese people rely on the sea for food, they hope that the fishing area can be expanded. In addition, Strachey's report apparently did not change the situation of reparations. Before this issue is resolved, Japanese industry cannot have any plans. Regarding the possibility of the United States individually allowing Japanese to enter the country, Ashida said: Those who are allowed to enter the United States are a small number of Japanese who are engaged in intermediary work for American consumers and manufacturers of Japanese export goods. Before the peace treaty is signed, Japan cannot freely conduct foreign trade.</p>

Evatt called for the implementation of the general principles of the Potsdam Declaration, but agreed that Japan could become "the factory of Asia" to some extent. "We must prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor again. We must maintain the living standards of Japan, but they should not be higher than those of the countries that have been attacked and damaged by Japan."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] An Allied Headquarters spokesman told the Japanese on the 9th that the US government is planning to spend money to supply Japan with raw materials to stabilize its economy. He asked the Japanese to complete the list of its important materials, which was ordered by MacArthur. Rosenford of the Allied Headquarters Economic and Scientific Group warned that most Japanese individuals, government agencies, and business firms must be subject to the Allied Headquarters order to submit a list of important materials, and must submit the list before the 10th.</p>

<h3>U.S. Loan Plan for Latin America Receives Lukewarm Response at Pan-American Conference; U.S. Intention Is to Counter Argentina's Proposal</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Bogotá, 8th] The United States encountered its most indifferent setback in the history of the Pan-American Conference on the 8th. When the United States read President Truman's message at the Pan-American Conference requesting Congress to lend another $500 million from the Export-Import Bank to South America, the delegations from more than 20 American countries attending the conference sat and listened in silence. The U.S. delegation was extremely embarrassed and angry.</p>
<p>Marshall had scheduled the reading of this message at the final meeting of the plenary session on the 8th, expecting the news to elicit enthusiasm. However, contrary to expectations, the entire auditorium remained silent from beginning to end during the reading of Truman's request, and remained so afterwards. U.S. representatives admitted that their "enticement" had failed. Their anger could not be dispelled, as they believed that Latin America had no sense of gratitude. The reading of Truman's message was intended to counter Argentina's leadership on economic issues and its proposal for a new Pan-American bank.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bogotá, Colombia, 8th] The U.S. delegation today proposed a thorough review of the economic plans currently under discussion at the Pan-American Conference, urging other American countries to reduce tariffs and eliminate international trade restrictions to promote global economic prosperity.</p>

<h3>Drafting Committee on Freedom of Information Passes Resolution to Resist Distorted News; Eastern and Western Nations in Harmony on This Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 8th, United Press International] The drafting committee of the International Conference on Freedom of Information passed a resolution stipulating resistance to inflammatory and distorted news. Prior to this, the U.S. representative had opposed a motion to prohibit journalists from attending hearings. The acting chairman of the committee, U.S. representative Mr. Conant, expressed that closed meetings were inconsistent with the purpose of the Conference on Freedom of Information. Thereupon, all representatives on the committee unanimously passed a motion to make the conference open. The proposal, supported by the United States and seven other Western countries, calling for immediate action both internationally and domestically within member states to resist distorted news, was revised by representatives from both Eastern and Western nations and unanimously passed by the ten-nation drafting committee. This is perhaps the most unifying resolution since the conference began three weeks ago.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 8th] The third committee of the Freedom of Information Conference unanimously passed a proposal today condemning any racial discrimination against journalists that hinders their news gathering.

<h3>Phibun Ordered to Form New Siamese Cabinet; Cabinet Members of Aphaiwong Will Not Participate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 9th] It is reported that the Siamese Regency Council summoned Marshal Phibun Songkhram, the leader of last year's coup, to the palace on the afternoon of the 8th and authorized him to form a new government. The new cabinet is expected to be an expanded coalition cabinet that includes all parties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bangkok, 8th] Siamese Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong has resigned under pressure from the military. The Regency Council today ordered Phibun to form a new cabinet.

According to informed sources, Phibun may invite former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong, who is in exile in Singapore, to return to the country and cooperate.</p>
<h3>General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyrighted by the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>(14) Neglecting China's Internal Situation</p>
<p>The majority of U.S. wartime aid to China was used for operations around Burma, while the situation within China deteriorated to near catastrophe.</p>
<p>I do not have statistics at hand to show the distribution of U.S. efforts during the Burma campaign, but I estimate that approximately ninety percent of the total capacity of the China-Burma-India Theater was used in that direction.</p>
<p>From the beginning, General Stilwell and his theater command staff almost completely ignored the possibility and need to expand the Hump airlift, with the exception of matters related to the Burma campaign. The special attention paid to the Burma campaign can be seen in the fact that he diverted eight aviation engineer regiments, originally assigned to India to improve airfields to increase the airlift capacity over the Himalayas from Upper Burma, to build the Ledo Road.</p>
<p>Our strategy—that is, General Stilwell's strategy—limited the main effort within China to defensive actions, and by mid-1944, even defense was out of the question.</p>
<p>China not only failed to contribute offensively to the defeat of Japan but even came close to complete collapse in 1944, when the Japanese offensive captured eastern China and reduced the possibility of opening a Chinese port to coordinate with U.S. forces in the Pacific to an immeasurable degree.</p>
<p>The Burma campaign first restored a long, difficult, and questionably valuable truck route, and laid an oil pipeline to southwestern China, the latter being its most concrete and direct contribution. In addition, it moved the Hump route southward somewhat, avoiding the need to fly at such high altitudes as before.</p>
<p>If the Japanese army could not be cleared from Northern Burma through General Stilwell's operations, it might not have been possible to airlift more than 30,000 tons of cargo to China each month. But if there had been no Burma campaign, then our entire strength could have been used for China itself, instead of just a very small portion.</p>
<p>We would also not have lost eastern China on the eve of Japan's imminent defeat. Since this statement may seem like hindsight, I must add that this is what I thought at the time our strategy was being formulated. I even believe that even if we had put most of our strength into Burma, we could still have held eastern China.</p>
<p>The reason we lost eastern China was simply due to a slight deficiency in strength. If a few hundred tons of supplies could have been delivered to the right place at the right time, the situation could have been salvaged.</p>
<p>I can only offer two difficult explanations for Stilwell's design: either he thought it was worthwhile to exchange Burma for eastern China and its forward air bases, or he simply lacked the foresight to strengthen the interior of China while conducting the Northern Burma campaign.</p>
<p>Our simplest military objective was to support the central government, which had been holding back over a million Japanese troops since 1937, so that it could cooperate when the U.S. expeditionary force needed to land on the Asian mainland.</p>
<p>Before the Japanese launched their offensive in early 1944, the theater command had never had a sound assessment of the situation within China. Even after the offensive was launched, the warnings and suggestions repeatedly made by my command were consistently ignored or underestimated.</p>
<p>The cooperative relationship between the theater command and the China command was insufficient and tense. There was no concrete U.S. aid for the armies defending Free China, only support for a small-scale air force, the effectiveness of which was constantly hampered by other parties vying for Hump airlift supplies.</p>
<p>In February 1944, I warned General Stilwell that the Japanese seemed about to launch an air offensive. Enemy air activity was the first available sign of an impending offensive.</p>
<p>In mid-March, I requested supplies from the Hump to support attacks on enemy ships and to maintain the strength of the air bases in eastern China.</p>
<p>I repeatedly requested in mid-March and repeatedly warned in April, and in a more concrete manner, because the enemy's intentions to launch an offensive had become increasingly clear. But the best response General Stilwell gave to these advance warnings was that we should do our best with the means at hand—which, in reality, were woefully inadequate.</p>

<h3>New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Approved After Consultation, Effective Yesterday; Telephone Nearly Doubles, Ranging from 65,000 to 70,000 Yuan; Strong Reactions, Prices Rise Across the Board in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The new prices for water, electricity, gas, and telephone services for April in this city have been determined. Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Huijue met yesterday morning with City Council representatives Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, and Tang Chengzong (represented by Gao Shu'an). They adjusted the prices based on changes in the cost of living index and the prices of foreign exchange and coal, according to the automatic adjustment formula promulgated by the central government. The adjustments were approved by the city government. Water prices increased by 69%, electricity by 65%, gas by 70%, and telephone by 98.4%. The new prices took effect yesterday (the 9th). During the review meeting, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao and the City Council representatives made every effort to lower the adjustment percentages requested by the various companies. The companies all argued that the increases in the cost of living index, foreign exchange, fuel (coal, diesel, etc.), and hardware were at least 40% and as high as over 100%. They felt that they could no longer afford to sustain losses. After four hours of debate during the meeting, Director Zhao and the City Council representatives repeatedly reduced the percentages, finally determining the new prices. Also, the excess usage fees for gas and the excess call counting rates for telephones were reduced during this review meeting. The excess usage fee for gas was previously calculated at twice the base price for both household and factory users, but now it has been changed to one and a half times the base price. The telephone counting rate was previously higher for calls exceeding 400 times, but now it will be charged the same rate as calls exceeding 200 times. In addition, because Dachang District has been officially incorporated into the city this month, the electricity rates of the Daya Electric Company in that district have also been reviewed and approved. However, all sectors of the city were surprised upon learning of the new prices, unanimously believing that the increases were too large and unexpected. The market in the city was still stable yesterday morning, but in the afternoon, stimulated by this news, prices rose across the board, eliciting a strong reaction. Citizens are feeling the direct and indirect impact of these price hikes and are finding it difficult to bear the burden. The four adjusted prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Water (per cubic meter) (increased by 69%)</p>
<p>Inland, Zhabei, and Pudong Companies: 29,000 yuan</p>
<p>British and French Water Companies: 22,000 yuan</p>
<p>Electricity (per kilowatt-hour) (average increase of 65%) Lighting/Heating Power</p>
<p>Shanghai Power Company: 20,400 yuan 17,000 yuan</p>
<p>French Company: 23,200 yuan 19,000 yuan</p>
<p>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: 26,500 yuan 22,300 yuan</p>
<p>Pudong Electric Company: 27,500 yuan 23,200 yuan</p>
<p>Huashang Electric Company: 29,500 yuan 24,600 yuan</p>
<p>Daya Electric Company: 34,450 yuan 29,000 yuan</p>
<p>Gas (increased by 70%)</p>
<p>Shanghai Gas Company and Wusong Gas Plant: 66,000 yuan per 100 cubic feet</p>
<p>Equivalent to 23,300 yuan per cubic meter</p>
<p>Telephone (per call) (average increase of 98.4%)</p>
<p>Under 200 calls: 9,000 yuan</p>
<p>Over 201 calls: 15,000 yuan</p>
<p>Public telephone: 20,000 yuan per call</p>
<p>Transportation Costs Set to Increase</p>
<p>The new prices for trams, buses, small trains, ferries, etc. for April will be implemented from the 15th of this month, after a review meeting is convened by the Public Utilities Bureau today. However, the amount of the increase still needs to be considered, so a decision may not be made today.</p>
<h3>Taxi Fares Increase by 55%; 20 Minutes Costs 280,000 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Municipal Meeting Approves Trial Implementation of Purchasing Surplus Rice from Rice Markets; Must Have Actual Rice and Cannot Sell Short</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The simplified rules for the Shanghai Municipal Government's purchase of surplus rice from the north and south rice markets were drafted by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and submitted to yesterday's municipal meeting for discussion. It was decided to approve the trial implementation of the rules, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All surplus rice in the north and south markets after free trading each morning may be applied for purchase from the Civil Affairs Committee by rice merchants before 2:00 PM that afternoon. The minimum application is 50 city piculs (each city picul is uniformly calculated at 156 city catties net weight), and there must be actual rice on hand; short selling is not allowed. The purchase price should not exceed the market price of free trading on that day (based on the market price list for that day). (2) In order to enrich the supply of civil food and avoid stimulating a sharp rise in rice prices, the Civil Affairs Committee may, after review by the review panel, decide whether to purchase the surplus rice applied for, or not to purchase it, or to purchase only a portion of it. (3) The Civil Affairs Committee may, at any time, entrust the market to sell and supply the surplus rice purchased in the preceding article according to the needs of the free market in order to regulate the market. (4) After the delivery order is reviewed and confirmed by the Civil Affairs Committee, the Civil Affairs Committee will pay 70% of the rice price first (a check for the second day), and the balance will be settled after all the rice has been inspected and accepted, with invoices and receipts. (5) After the rice is sold, the actual rice must be delivered within 24 hours. All inspection, weighing, warehousing, and storage are handled by warehouses designated by the Civil Affairs Committee entrusted by the national banks.</p>
<h3>Sakhalin Returnees Expelled from Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Ninety-eight returnees from Sakhalin Island, registered by the Social Affairs Bureau, took the Hualian and Zhongxing vessels in two batches to make a living in Taiwan.

<h3>Soldier Trafficker Jumps from Vehicle to Escape: Shot and Killed During Pursuit</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a statement yesterday, saying: "Chuan Xiangfu, a soldier assigned to deliver documents by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, suddenly went missing on March 18th while carrying three official documents for delivery. An immediate search was launched, which found that the deserter had been enticed by Dai Yushan, a soldier trafficker from Taicang County. Considering the trafficker's audacity in inducing active-duty military personnel of national defense agencies and the gravity of the crime, Zhang Yuren, a section chief from the adjutant office, was dispatched to Taicang with adjutants to arrest Dai Yushan in conjunction with Magistrate Xue. Four checks totaling 84 million yuan were found on him at the time of the arrest. In his residence, three deceived and sold draftees, including He Rongshuang, were found confined indoors. However, the deserter Chuan Xiangfu had already been drafted into the army. Subsequently, Dai Yushan led the way to the Taicang Self-Defense Brigade to hand over Chuan. Dai was then escorted back for interrogation. It was revealed that Chuan Xiangfu's documents were also seized by Dai Yushan and handed over to Xu Xianfa (a native of Taicang). According to Dai's confession, he was willing to lead the recovery efforts. A platoon leader of the special task company, Wang Pinquan, was assigned to escort Dai to Taicang to retrieve the seized documents. However, the suspect, fearing punishment, jumped from the vehicle and escaped near Jinshi Road on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. After a half-mile pursuit in the dark of night, the platoon leader fired a warning shot. The suspect continued to flee and was subsequently shot and killed. The incident was reported, and the headquarters sent personnel to the scene to inspect the body and arrange for burial. Considering the suspect's crimes, the original intention was to impose severe punishment. His attempt to escape and subsequent death are deemed well-deserved. The remaining suspects are currently under strict interrogation."</p>
<h3>Rental Dispute on Yanqing Road: Residents Vigorously Defend Their Right to Residence</h3>
<p>Another serious housing rental dispute has recently occurred in this city. All 60-plus households in the lane at No. 2 Yanqing Road have recently received a notice from the lawyer entrusted by Peiben Hall and Lizhi Society, stating that the 20-plus buildings in the lane have been mortgaged by Peiben Hall to Lizhi Society, and they are required to vacate the premises within a specified period. More than 300 residents are panic-stricken, as the housing shortage has not eased, and they will be displaced after eviction. Furthermore, since the tenants have obtained legal lease rights, the landlord is not allowed to mortgage the property according to law. They have hired lawyers Zhou Yizhi, Sun Liang, and Li Zhongdao to protect their legal right to reside and seek legal solutions.</p>
<h3>Hengmao Typing Service Cracked for Operating Gold and Currency Trading: Five Men and Women Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Based on a tip and after three days of secret investigation, Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the Economic Police Brigade of the police department, cracked down on a black market gold and currency trading organization at No. 397 Sichuan Middle Road yesterday. More than 300 US dollars, a US$5,000 check from Citibank in New York, and more than 1 billion yuan in legal tender checks were confiscated on the spot. The person in charge, Mao Deqing, and five customers, including Li Zhende (female), Gu Zhangqiao, Wang Hongzhang, and Pei Guozhu, were detained. Four hundred US dollars were found on Gu Zhangqiao, more than 200 million yuan in legal tender checks were found on Wang Hongzhang, and fourteen US dollars were found on Pei Guozhu. After interrogation at the police station, all were detained due to the seriousness of the circumstances. The address of the organization was originally the Hengmao Exchange, run by Li Lansheng, a major figure in the money exchange industry. However, after the government banned gold and currency trading, it was changed to Hengmao Typing Service, but it secretly continued to operate black market gold and currency transactions. Li Lansheng himself has gone to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Litigious Madman: Specializing in Making Judges Happy - Gao Jingmiaoqing Files Another Bizarre Lawsuit, Listing Thousands of Businesses as Defendants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Gao Jingqing, who is fond of litigation, previously filed a nonsensical lawsuit against Shen Junru of the China Democratic League and Senator Zhang Zhongyuan. Now, he has filed another lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing more than 2,900 companies, including Yiyuan Transportation Company. After reviewing the case, Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu deemed Gao to be mentally ill and rejected the case.</p>
<p>Gao's lawsuit is very lengthy, stating: "Yiyuan Transportation Company and more than 2,900 other companies have violated laws and regulations, hindered economic construction, and openly plundered social interests. I request a public prosecution according to law." Attached is a huge list of defendant companies, including almost all major businesses in the city. The lawsuit states that Gao is from Jiangping Lake, 43 years old, originally residing at No. 344 Jinling East Road, a merchant, whose wife runs a miscellaneous goods stall. The summons should be collected on his behalf by lawyer Mao Xianshen. The content is full of absurdity, with many clever remarks. The places he considers to be good sentences are marked with double circles. Here are some of his "good sentences": "Our country has undergone a revolution for more than 30 years. Every year, horses scream on the battlefield, and everywhere people cry for new things. Tracing the origin of the disaster, who is the evil? I am a commoner and dare to seek fame. I only hate the merchants who harm the country and only wish that every alley was full of soldiers. The cycle of heaven is endless, and the holy way will always shine in the middle of the sky. How can wise men stand idly by, making children sad? I propose to file a lawsuit according to the spirit of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China." The witness Xu Jiqing is noted at the end.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's comments state: "After reviewing the lawsuit, the content is incoherent, and the plaintiff's whereabouts are uncertain, so the summons cannot be served. It has been changed to be sent to the designated recipient, lawyer Mao Xianshen, who then sent a letter stating that the filer is a madman, the matter is bizarre, and he has no knowledge of this inexplicable lawsuit. He refuses to accept it. The allegations are obviously false and extremely hateful and should not be accepted. It is hereby rejected."</p>

They questioned the matter strictly, which angered the owner, Sheng Panchang, who ordered his waiters to close the doors. Mi went outside to report to the patrol police, at which point Zhang Wenbo was surrounded by the waiters, who tore up the patrol warrant he was carrying.

<h3>Japanese War Criminal Noya Kahei Tried Yesterday: Utterly Evasive</h3>
<p>The military court of the Ministry of National Defense for the trial of war criminals, tried Noya Kahei, the commander of the 133rd Division of the Japanese Army, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The war criminal evaded all the crimes committed during the war. In order to collect evidence, the court decided to continue the trial on the 12th. According to the information, Noya Kahei, male, 59 years old, from Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, once served as the commander of the 5th Independent Infantry Brigade and the 133rd Division of the Army. In March of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he came to Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and held the position of garrison commander. Soon after, the Japanese government announced its surrender, but he was still waiting for orders in Hangzhou. His troops' hatred towards our military and civilians was still unappeased. On August 20th, they arrested Zhou Zheng, the deputy director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Working Supervision Office of the Military Affairs Committee's Loyal Patriotic Army, his chief of general affairs, Xu Da, guide Xu Guang, and more than ten other people, including team leader Lou Yongjin, at the Qianjiang Bridge in Hangzhou and took them to the Zhijiang University headquarters, where they were interrogated in every possible way. That night, Zhou Zheng, Xu Guang, Xu Da, and others were shot. Lou Yongjin and others heard their screams, but the situation was urgent, so they bravely broke out and fortunately escaped the disaster. Xu Da also managed to escape because he was not seriously injured. Furthermore, in the 34th year of the Republic, the war criminal allowed his troops to loot property everywhere in the villages and towns of Hubei, Xuzhou, and Jiangling counties, and wantonly set fires and slaughtered people. After the war, the war prisoner management office of the Xuzhou Pacification Office reported by telegram to the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters to order the First Pacification District Command to arrest the war criminal for looting and sabotage, and escort him for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Prices Slightly Decline Yesterday: Rice Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, prices generally declined slightly. Cotton yarn and cloth rose sharply and then retreated quickly. Cigarettes saw a slight decline due to the large number of shipments. Daily necessities also weakened. However, rice prices continued to rise, an exception due to reports of soaring costs in producing areas.</p>
<p>Rice continued its climb to a peak yesterday. The morning opening price was reported to be rising, and the main traders took the opportunity to raise prices, causing the market to soar by another 200,000. The People's Food Allocation Association sold 892.5 piculs of early rice at the market at prices of 3.8 million to 3.75 million. The owners of the goods were timid and sought to sell, but sales were sluggish on this street, and the market started to decline, eventually rising by 50,000 to 100,000. White japonica rice was priced at 4 million, up 100,000. Early rice white yuan was up 50,000. The rise in the northern market was more intense than in the southern market.

"Old Car" flour was down slightly by 10,000, and "Jiancheng Red Bee" flour was down by 20,000. Bran initially rose to 910,000, but closed at 860,000, down 25,000.</p>
<p>Grains: Mostly fell, few rose. Soybean oil factories stood on the sidelines, and the market showed signs of fatigue. Hankou Zha beans opened in the morning at 1.95 million, gradually falling to 1.85 million, but after the oil factories came back to pick them up, they rose back to 1.9 million, up slightly by 100,000. Local beans were down slightly by 50,000. Corn was flat and tired, red sorghum was up 50,000, sesame seeds were down slightly by 230,000, selected green beans were down another 50,000, and raw peanuts were up slightly by 150,000.</p>

Local factory soybean oil initially fell by 300,000, but the market rebounded later, down slightly by 200,000.

Soybean cake had risen too sharply in succession, and customers from other provinces withdrew. The factories had openings, and the morning opening prices all plummeted. There was a lack of inquiries, but the results rebounded slightly by 450,000 yuan due to the stabilization of customer sales.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the past, the re-export of flour was limited to first- and second-grade flour, but in reality, the production of third- and fourth-grade flour is much larger than that of first- and second-grade flour, and they are sold far to North China and the provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. However, since the Ministry of Food did not approve the re-export of third- and fourth-grade flour, sales in nearby areas have been sluggish, affecting capital turnover. Therefore, the flour guilds in the four districts are requesting the Ministry of Food to approve the transportation of third- and fourth-grade flour for re-export, in order to facilitate production and regulate the food supply.</p>

<h3>Wenzhou New Longjing</h3>
<h3>More Arrivals Gradually Reduce Market Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] This year's Wenzhou pre-Qingming new Longjing has been on the market for almost two weeks. However, due to the small number of arrivals, the process has not been lively. Recently, there has been a sudden influx of large amounts into Shanghai, but the quality has gradually become more mature than before, so the industry has been mutually reducing prices again. Currently, the price has dropped to 2.78 million yuan per catty, and goods of lower quality have dropped to 2.45 million yuan per catty. According to market observations, there may be a small decline in the future. As for Lion Peak Longjing, according to news from the producing areas, it is also time to produce new tea, and it is expected to be on the market soon.</p>

As for export varieties, supply was as scarce as before due to dwindling inventories. However, export tea merchants felt that overseas demand was very strong and continued to purchase at good prices, so the market atmosphere turned forward again.</p>

However, it was reported after the close that it had fallen further to 4.76 million. Wufu was 4.5 million, and Blue Chicken was 4.45 million.

<h3>Ping Jinya and Zhu Bing Sue Each Other Over Paper Purchase; Two Parties Confront Each Other in Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhu Bing, the general manager of the Xin Sui Company, was accused of fraud, and the trial opened at the local court yesterday. The plaintiff, Ping Jinya of the Central Bookstore, appeared in court, while the defendant, Zhu Bing, was brought from the detention center. He was wearing a worn-out Western suit without a tie, his face haggard, and he no longer possessed his former demeanor. According to Ping's accusation, he had ordered 3,000 reams of Soviet newsprint from Zhu, paying a deposit of 300.6 million yuan. When the delivery date arrived, Zhu failed to deliver the goods, only returning 100 million yuan to Ping. The estimated value of the 3,000 reams of newsprint at the time was 15.645 billion yuan. Zhu defended himself, stating that he had ordered 2,000 tons of newsprint from the Soviet commercial counselor, of which 1,000 tons had arrived. Due to the inability to deliver the goods on time, he had returned 100 million yuan to Ping, and 200.6 million yuan remained outstanding, which was in fact a civil debt dispute. As the company's manager, Qi Enfu, and the head of the finance department, Xu Mengbiao, were not present, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning. Zhu was returned to detention.</p>

<h3>Misunderstanding Cleared Between Students of Both the Shanghai Art School and the Shanghai New School</h3>
<p>Art School Clarifies the Truth About Housing Disputes</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute caused by the Art School taking back its school building, the school claimed yesterday: "The school's Hairongzhai school building (i.e., No. 127 Yongnian Road) was rented to Jin Tai Paper Shop due to the relocation of the school's branch during the war. It was clearly stipulated at the time that sub-leasing or replacement was not allowed. The lease expired in September 1945, and the school had repeatedly notified the lessee in advance to fulfill the contract. Unexpectedly, he refused to move out, and we had no choice but to resort to legal means. We were granted a judgment ordering him to move out within a limited time, but the lessee still ignored it. Yesterday, the local court sent police officers to enforce the order. Our school obeyed the law and complied with the court's disposal. While the police officers were carrying out the order, although our students helped with the relocation, there was no intrusion or destruction. By the evening, the police officers had not completed their task and ordered the complete relocation within three days. As for the misunderstanding between the students of the Shanghai New School and our school, it was resolved after the teachers of both schools persuaded them," it said.</p>
