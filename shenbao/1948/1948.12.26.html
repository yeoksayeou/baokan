<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓二十五日廣播：共和黨議員周以德吿合衆社記者稱：「杜魯門總統及國務院如願負中國失敗於共產黨之責，則國會無怯細使彼等不作如此措置。」國會改組時，局氏將為少數黨黨員，但仍為衆院重要議員之一。渠為其他議員認為贊成援華團體之主要發言人。因此渠對記者表示，渠相信國會對於軍事援助中國政府軍隊事，恐不致越過政府一點，認為意義重大·渠解釋稱：「上次國會開會時渠曾迫使政府採取行動將對華軍事及復興援助作成經濟合作法案，但其後發展證明法律雖可通過，但不能細制其執行·社魯門與馬歇爾如不願援助中國，則吾國會議員亦無能為力」。</p>
<p>周氏稱：如十年前羅斯福願意出賣中國，則對日戰爭未必發生，然羅氏及赫爾願意接受戰爭，而不願接受毀滅之命運。若羅赫之決定無誤，則今日杜魯門與馬歇爾之決定聽憑共產黨毀滅中國之獨立，自屬大錯。如美國竟必欲迫令中國成立一容納共黨之聯合政府，則其後果必造成第二捷克或波蘭無疑·美國今日卽採有效行動，尙不　暹。</p>

<p>〔合衆社南京廿五日電〕行政院副院長吳鐵城，頃單獨接見合衆社記者，細調孫科新內閣決繼續對共黨作戰，直至共黨乞和為止。吳氏稱：「新政府之唯一目標，為繼續對共黨作戰，直至彼等需要和平，幷了解和平對國家十分重要時方休。現內閣為戰時內閣，幷非投降內閣」。按吳氏素為蔣總統之最接近之顧問之一，現在任務厥在策劃新戰時內閣之政策之團體內一份子·吳氏以令人不致誤會之言語表示樂觀，卽國軍雖節節失利，新政府具有希望，幷除重新振興及動員仍在政府手中之區域—長江以南—對共黨力戰外，幷無其他計劃。渠稱：新政府將加細江南之防務，促進生產，供應人力及新軍，以重振仍在北方之軍隊」。吳鐵城繼稱：宣布任何新政策現尙過早，但同時亦可謂藍本正在草擬中、根據此項計劃，兵役機構將電加檢討，巨大人力將變成龐大數量之軍隊。「此將成為全面努力，凡為繼續對共戰事所以需者將盡力為之」。吾人將繼續作戰，直至將來乞和者乃共黨為止。</p>
<p>與吳氏所表示之同樣樂觀精神，在其他方面亦頗顯明。此外，且有政府內較為重要之各部門中間完全合作之明顯與不尋常之形象，各知他人所為何事，彼此合作。</p>
<p>現無人否認局勢之嚴重，但同時，政府高級官員中對前途表示悲觀者為數極少。政府某高級官負表明，共黨在蘇北，徐州與蚌埠之役中，損失較國軍為大。渠幷申述一列談話，以證明此點，謂假使共軍當傎獲得彼等自稱之重大勝利，則彼等勢必迅速利用良機，「共軍如曾佔優勢，彼等卽不致加以放棄，共軍係被迫而放棄採取攻勢，以補充力量及重加編整，圖另尋攻抵長江之途」。渠指塘沽為林彪部隊在華北之主要目標，天津次之，幷謂，北平對共黨幷無戰略上價值，故共黨不願犧牲兵力以奪取傳作義將軍之主要作戰基地。</p>
<p>歸納新政府各高級官員等談話中之意見，使大有一種印象，卽彼等幷未放棄希望，亦不預料將來會崩潰。另一方面，各高級官員措詞審愼之聲明，均未嘗不提及和談。同時，彼等亦同樣審愼，不明言和平必須由共黨方面主動。不過，無疑在暗中有從事和平之事，且有明證。京中若干最無可非議之中國人士又外籍人士方面給予合衆社之消息，卽為玥證。</p>

<h3 id="c22">勝利後美對華軍事援助　總計二億三千萬美元　美報載達二三十億美元不確 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕此間中國官員廿四日稱：自日本投降以來，美國對華直接軍事援助共計二億三千萬美元。此數與若干報章所戲謂此種軍事援助共達二十億美元至三十億美元一說，相去甚大。中國官員稱，諸如有用之小武器及彈藥等之有效作戰援助，自大戰結束以來，確實運交中國者，僅佔二億三千萬美元中軍事援助中之一部份。中國正式公佈中國方面之援助數字如此，此數曾在報端辯論甚久。以前華方曾勉細地加以辯論，蓋恐懼含有偏見之意。然中國權威方而官員以彼等之意見是否合衆社，中國及美國閒對「援華」之意見在基本觀點上略有出入。華方稱：「例如太平洋島上之正在損壞之剩餘物資，彼等僅應該以最近之出售價格計算，而美方在援華轉上大部份對此以原來生產成本計算。美華官方對美陸軍部所規定之剩餘物資之帳面價值數字之爭執甚久。華方稱，美國最近報載自日本投降以還，援華總數已達二十億或三十億之鉅，乃不正確者及故意渲染。</p>
<p>「根華方當局之估計，在日本投降迄今三年半中，美國援助及借貸予華之總數為十一億七千三百萬美元，其中大部份為救濟及民用物資，同一期內之軍事物資總數為二億三千萬美元。「美援可分三種，第一為贈品或借款，第二為剩餘物資，第三為服務費用。贈品借款總數為一，一七三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，包括美國捐贈與聯合國着後救濟總署及其他國際救濟計劃，計美國外國救濟計劃五一八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，借款一四五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，租借怯案項中軍事物資一一〇，〇〇〇元，一九四八年援華法案四億美元，其中一億二千五百萬美元係供軍用物資·一九四八年援華法案下一部份物資尙未送達中國。第二種之剩餘物資為一九九，三〇〇，〇〇〇元，此數字最富於辯論性者。中國係基於中國購買之價格計算其價值，美國之價值係基於八億二千萬元生產價值計算之。第三種「服務費用」三七七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，此數乃美方所計算者，供重收回及日本賠償之服務費用。華方稱此項數目幾及美國給予中國租借法案數目之半，中國不能正確地認為此乃對華之直接援助。所有援華問題中最困難者，乃為已運華之戰具之正確數字。據基方吿合衆社稱，中國在對共產主義作戰最需要者為小型武器，諸如來復槍，機槍及軍火。據華方報告稱，自日本投降至一九四八年十月中間，中國所接獲此項武器僅為五千萬發軍火，價值二百萬美元，及一萬三千萬發七·九二厘口徑之軍火。第一批於日本投降不久後運抵者，第二批直至一九四七年始運抵·美政府估計第二批軍火之值價為六，五六四，九九二美元，中國方面稱：彼等不能接受此項帳面價值，蓋實際出售價格為六五六，四九九美元·華方又稱：自一九四八年十月之後，一二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元軍事援華項目下，有四批運華，第一批為六百噸，其餘三批總數為一萬二千噸，第一第二兩批已抵華，其餘二批在來華途中。自日本投降以後，中國所接獲之軍事物資總數不到二億三千萬元，包括剩餘物資項下之軍事物資及一億二千五百萬元之軍事援助計劃。彼等又申稱，美國所列舉之七二八〇〇〇，〇〇〇元租借法案中，三三七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元為手續費並非物資，而其餘之差額中，華方稱，彼等使接獲之發票帳單，僅為一億一千萬元，雙方對價格之不同電見在談判中。一億一千萬元中四千萬元價值係軍需品材料。華方又指出中國所接獲之租借法案極為有限，與蘇聯接獲一百十億元，租借方案相較有天壤之別。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕中國官員廿四日宣稱：自對日作戰勝利日以後，中國自美國方面獲得之信用貸款，總額計二〇二，八〇〇，〇〇〇美元（包括八二，八〇〇，〇〇〇美元在內），但尙有一六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元尙未撥付，故實際之差額為一八六，八〇〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>渠等稱：中國早己償還一三二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，到期未還之差額為五四，八〇〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>渠等並稱：「中國政府及人民對美國政府給予中國之大量援助，當然深加感激，但特別在擴大援助問題正待考慮之今日，關於此項援助之闡述反聲明，必須合乎事實，俾能預防任何誇張或誤解。」</p>

<h3 id="c23">中美兩國之科學研究 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 羅開富</p>
<p>中美兩國卿為世界重要國家。兩國經濟狀况之　殊，人其不知。茲就兩國科學研究之狀况作一比較，或亦不無意義。</p>
<p>理論科學為實用科學之母，實用科學為改善物質生活之本，美國人最嗜享受，其提倡工程科學，可謂與改善農業視同一體。各大工廠深知產品之改良，非澈底研究各產品之原理不為功。於是爭相設立研究部門，延聘純粹科學人員，日夕研究。每研究部之設備興人材，最少相當於一我國任何研究所，而其研究範圍，每限於三數種製造。無怪其出品得以日新月異。</p>
<p>我國新興工廠如申新紡織廠之類，近年亦知延聘科學人員指導生產，成績殊有可觀。惟僅負責指導，未聞有研究部門之設立，更無特為研究而置之設備。羈謂文學之成功，倚仗天才；科學之進步，端賴設備。不有設備，無以發現新知；不根據新知識，無以談改良。我國工業製品不能與外國者比擬，此為主要原因。</p>
<p>政府機關之研究部門，中美兩國更有明顯對照。戰時，美國軍事組織擴大，僅於美京一處，網羅中外地理慶者百餘人。歐洲登陸之前一年，早已研究各處登陸之可能及得失。攻德之先，對於進兵柏林之路綫，及各綫之難易與克服之方，參謀處早有成算。為準備在我國登陸夾擊日軍，又多方搜集資料，製成我國沿岸之軍事地圖百餘種。『知己知彼，百戰百勝』，美國人可謂深得其要。卽在平時，美國外交部（俗稱『國務院』）亦聘用專門學者，研究各國資源及其他建設問題。今日，駐滬總領事館中，猶有專人搜集我國各項地理材料，寄返美京研究。夫，洞悉國情，間為樽俎折衝之要。我國外交部豈不知之！徒以經費有限，心有餘而力不足。對外使節，已因宣傳費之短絀而感焦頭爛額，焉有餘力以雇人奔走防問與搜驪？</p>
<p>美國農業部之研究機構，更為宏大與週密，每一作物或家畜，均有專家數人負責研究。其選種除病增產之方法與技術，聽由農民詢問與請援。農染氣象，水土保持，農產運輸，農業經濟，又均特設專部研究。各省有農業處，每處之業務與研究並重。處下有各地實騐所及農塲。各塲所常有研究報吿，各處之出版物更多，部本身之出版物，則尤多而尤有價值。</p>
<p>我國農林部亦設中央實驗所，林業實驗所，及其他相類機構，從事研究推廣興指導。各所研究人員愼重遴選，其出版物殊有價值。惜乎同樣機構，朱能普及於各地。各省農林處之設備與人材，多未充實，某農林處長自知該處出版物不群不盡，曾勸作者勿予採用。彼固一純粹學者，否則絕不肯坦白相吿。其勸作者之語，正足反映其傷心與感慨。某縣農業推廣所有農塲百餘畝，全所職員二人，其一為農業學者，其一為轉業軍官。該軍官能征慣戰，縣府受命安置，苦無適當席位，故委以農業推廣工作！研究機關之『先天不足，後天失調」，一至於此！作者甚望該農塲為國內僅有之例。</p>
<p>我國政府機關而致力於純粹研究工作者，以中央研究院及北平研究院較有良好設備。此項政府機關，美國無之，不少重要國家亦無之，我國誠可以此自豪·中研院有十三研究所，北研院有九所。此外，尙有中英文敎基金會與敎育部設立之海洋研究所，大地測量研究所，　　研究所，地理研究所。又有中央地質調查所及各省地質調查所及土壞研究所，福建省立科學研究院等。大學敎師一面授課，一面研究，而研究所人員雀去授課之煩。工作旣有優待，人選乃較嚴格。工作成續不論如何優良，苟未達相當資歷，概不得為研究員。因是之故，研究所之設備卽使甚為簡陋，而於國外仍有相當聲望。抗戰期問，生活至苦，而各研究所猶能照常出版研究報吿。吾人固不以此自大，而美國學者巳驚嘆不止。又有若干研究所在抗職期內經費不積，各研究人員絞盡心血，務使各所繼續存在。其奮鬥過程之可歌可泣，更非美國人所能想像。</p>
<p>美國固無政府專設之研究機關，但有私人主辦之研究組織。美京之斯密遜研究院及卡納基研究院，可為此例。兩院研究範圍不廣，而皆有充分基金，經費絕無短缺之處。設備之添置，一任研究人員之所欲。兩院成績久已蜚聲全球，斯院之生物類及人類學與卡院之植物學出版物，允為第一流作品。此固研究人員努力之表現，設非環境安定，設備充足，又焉足以表現？荀我國各研究機構之添價設備，能一如研究人員之所欲，又焉知其成績不更使美國學者嘆服？</p>
<p>美國研究機構旣少，大部研究工作，遂成大學敎師之事。誠然，大學敎師之所以異於中小學敎師者，在能不斷獲得新事實，不斷更新智識與見解。荀無研究機會以發現新知，照書講授，人云亦云，則大學者，中學之續矣，何以達成訓練研究人材之旨？美國大學敎師之待遇，一般而論，遜於政府公務員，更遜於工廠技師。惟每學系之主要敎師（得為副敎授或助敎授），各有書記一人，以整理其文稿。較優之大學，尙可為敎授之研究而雇用多人，以編理其材料。以地理敎師而論，如須利用假期前赴遠處考察，得由校方賣送。可見學校不獨栽培學生，兼且栽培敎師。我國敎授之待遇如何，於此不必深論。但舉一事言之，某敎授因月入所得，無法貸送其子女入學，會對作者云：「我袛能敎子女不再讀書，蓋恐讀書之後，亦將如我之不能培養其子女」。辛酸呻吟，不忍卒聽，又豈美國敎授所能想儀者。</p>
<p>中外學者，莫不承認我國學生或敎師荀能在國外稍加用功，其學習或研究成績，必不在任何人之後；迨其返國，始逐漸　沉。於此，吾人不禁有橋枳之感。荀謂此係個人墮落所致，則國外生活，輕鬆優遊，何以不墮落於彼，而獨墮落於禮義之邦？</p>
<p>近年歐洲政局不安，德國尤甚。美國大學利用此機，盡量羅致人材，因是世界第一流學者，漸次集中美國，尤以物理數學化學氣象諸門為多。此類學者，非全屬猶太人。來美之後，因心安境裕，工作更有生氣。可見科學之進步，固在精神，尤在環境，茍謂科學之與轟，純係科學人員內在之變化，試問歐洲學者，何必趨赴美國？德國素稱科學之園，何以在戰事數年之中，科學一無進展，而美國則猛晋不已？唯科學人員能安心居留於美國，美國前此雖未產生第一流理論科學人材，而此後既經第一流學者之黨冶，不久恐亦成為靈要科學中心。</p>
<p>我們科學工作人員遭遇之困扼，政府必巳洞察無遺。深信必能逐漸予以改善。聞軍事機關之研究部門設備優勝，深信政府必能以此度彼，務使一切研究機構，均有優良設備，俾科學得以普遍發展，而不受特殊拘束。日前拜讀李春昱先生『中國科學事業的危機』一文（八月廿二日上海大公報），深佩指論正確，治本有方。近讀徐佛觀先生『中國科學事業的另一危機』一文，不禁感慨萬端。因貢所知，以就敎於高明。作者但盼國內科學事業順遂發展，見仁見智，原非所計也。</p>

<p>查唐委員鴻烈·任委員秉鈞糾舉善後事業委會保管委員會物資供應總庫總經理翁為失職，暨汽車管理所副經理湯麥斯私售汽車零件等情弊一案，經委員等會同審查，僉以該物資供應總庫汽車管理所副經理湯麥斯，於本年六七月間私售汽車零件十二件與上海恒與號，且於七月五日所售恒興號之四項另件中，每件只作價二百萬元，而恒興號早於六月廿六日將上述四項另件轉售於中華救濟團，每件售價五百萬元，是該副經理未經呈准，擅售公物，於怯自屬不合，况恒興號卽於六月廿六日已將上述四項另件以高價轉售他方，足證該汽車管理所七月五日所開具價格較低之設票，顯係不實，而該總庫總經理翁為竟不加追究，予以結案，實難辭失職之咎，應請轉行政院將該善後事業委員會保管委員會物資供應總庫總經理翁為暨所屬汽車管理所副經理湯麥斯依法懲戒。再該善後事業委員會缺乏專門技術人員，委員多係兼職，未能專心致力，各項業務計劃多受保管委員會之牽制，以致會務未能積極開展，該保管委員會華籍委員，亦多為兼職，不常到會視事，谷項重要決定，多取決於外籍委員，並於會內在法定組織以外加設許多機構，全部職員達數千人，實嫌過多，其行政費及事業費因在保管款內自行支用，善後事業委員會實際上無權監核。又善後事業委員會設在南京，而保管委員會則設上海，聯繫不便，應請併函行政院，將該善後事業委員會暨所屬保管委員會在整價機構上，業務上以及職權與人事方面，迅作合理之改善與調整。</p>

<p>〔本報常德廿日航訊〕許多不瞭解湘西的人，認為湘西這地方怪特，神秘，其實不然，不過是封建潛勢力猖獗，交通阻塞，若干方面比較「下江」落後吧了。目前的湘西，在整個戡亂軍事上，總算能偏安一時，而在安定中求建設，乃為李默庵司令官的重點措施，李氏最近號召的二件大工程，在民衆擁戴下，迅速地展開。</p>
<p>開髪富源　整理沅水</p>
<p>沅水在湘西是主要的營養腺，發源於貴州黎平山，經廿餘縣，蜿蜓而東，從漢壽注入洞庭湖，全長二千餘里。流域重要物產有金·煤·汞·磺·鉛·鋅·鐵·藥材·杉不·竹，桐油尤為爭取外匯的主要貨品。但上游多山，不利航行，中游險灘五六處，歷年人民生命財產之損失，無怯計數，下游出口處日漸淤積，將成災患，但整理工程浩大，李默庵於上月底在常德召集流域各縣縣長，議長，商會理事長，地方縉紳及專家，在常德開了個極重要的決定性的會議，決定了整個工程的步驟，解決了歷年無法解決的困難，及一切技術問題，於是，本月十日起全面動工了，此一浩繁的水利工程的組織，在十七綏部及湖南沅資流域規劃發展委會下設沅水工程委會，重要工程地帶設工程處或工務所，大量聘用工程顧問及專門委員，乘水低時期，分今明兩年計十二個月完成。</p>
<p>中游最艱難的炸礁鑿灘，巳招標淸理亂石，至團水工程，發動人民義務勞動，酌貼伙食，工程費預定穀十萬石。漢壽縣為沅江幹流，注入洞庭湖總口，自大圍堤潰決後，沅水卽不循故道，致幹流入口處河床高，泥沙淤塞，航道為阻，甚至漢籌飮水問題都受威脅，同時一至春夏汎，出水無怯調節，漢壽一縣的生命財產，難免遭殃，所以在這段中，分設工程處及工務所多處，工程費預定一三七，七五〇美元，第一期已於本月初開工，至明年五月止，漢壽曾議長保證可動員民工五萬人，經費問題，每畝田可自動捐米四至五斗，毫無問題，因為整理後漢壽的好處最大，圍堤湖田可達十七萬畝。常德的陡山灌溉工程，主要在引導沅江支流灌溉陡山一帶的萬餘畝農田，並可防止旱災，也在本月開工了，在支流上游建滾水壩，船筏道，水閘，防洪堤，棘水閘，分水閘。涵洞，倒洪管，减洪閘，洩洪閘，便橋，及土方三八〇〇〇立方公尺，工程費預定六〇〇〇〇美元，中央已核准補助金圓五五二〇〇元，全部工程估計明年九月底可完成。</p>
<p>依照預定目標，此水利工程完成後，載設三百市担船隻及木簰竹筏，由淸浪灘至常德，終年可暢通。常德以下，終年可航行三百噸以上輸船，而流域諸物產亦得因此源源無阻輸出。上游則可利用水力發電，創辦各種電動事業。常德陡山灌溉工程之完成，每年可增收稻毀三萬祖，但橫在目前一筆龐大的費用泥？湘西人堅定的回答：我們有無窮的人力，另外，當局刻正計劃水運的特產如竹，木，棉，五掊子，桐油，紙張，烟葉，水泥等，加收稅率百分之二至五，湘西人現正樂意為此偉大工程大付出任何代價，共同努力。</p>
<p>便利交通　開闢公路</p>
<p>打開湘西地圖，以常德為中心，除了常　公路，湘黔路常沅段，和常長公路外，在這中間的廣大地區上，便是一片空白，湘西的八區，沒有一寸公路，綏靖部依照上次綏靖會議決議，成立軍路修築委會，省公路局總工程師奉派參加，委會下設工務總段二十三段，當地縣長兼總段長，第一期工程先展開常德至桃源，慈利至潱縣，石門至慈利，慈利至大庸等綫，上月底，李兼司令官默庵召集各縣及有關人員開會，為爭取時間，決利用農暇，採用人民義務勞動，先從常慈，慈機，慈庸三綫着手，本月初，各棧同時動工。</p>
<p>常慈公路全長九十公里，在桃源境內的佔三分之二，其中常桃段在戰前已築好，戰時又破壞。桃慈段在三十四年便動工，但三年來一直未曾　好，桃源段縣長對記者設，他是者下不着上的官吏，所以，他這回很努力，雖然他巳調省，但他堅決表示要把這條路在他手賽完成，他親自在路上督工，顯然非常辛苦，二千多民工，每天從遠至五里外的河里去桃沙，近萬的勞動英雄，把汗滴在路上，毫無倦容，為了把自己從貧困中拔救出來，他們的工作情緒是興奮的。汗是沒有白流的，段縣長肯定地設：再過二十八個睛天，常慈公路可全綫通車。慈利到潱縣的土方，橋樑，涵洞，都要從頭新築，臨潱縣長打赤足，穿草鞋，冒雨在路上督工，有時也去掘一鋤，萬餘民工熱烈緊張地在工作着，塲面之動人，據說還是空前。慈庸綫是沿潱水走的新路，也是空前插入入區的一條觸角，工程較其他各綫為浩大，慈利刻正集中全力於慈濃綫，這邊日然暫時放鬆了，但總段辦公處成立，且看大庸縣餘出力量來。</p>
<p>防水防匪　常德築城</p>
<p>記者要附帶報導另一浩繁的築城工程：常德有座旣古且老又破的城回，許多角落，已坍成平地，人人可以自由出入，祇有南門一帶，因防沅江之水衝入，故時時在修，迄仍完好，但如春夏兩汎，單憑南門一隅是無濟於事，一旦發洪，常德城的生命財產，必遭到無法統計的災害。尤其在兵荒馬亂的今日，為鞏固城防，基於破產保產，拼命保命的號召，常德重建城墻又動工了。</p>
<p>城防部專設工程組，副指揮官王鳴生負責實地監督指導，李默庵司令官和其他高級官員，無不親與其事。上月廿七日動工，五千餘民工，沒有待遇，沒有尤怨，男女老少，從四十里內的每個村落圍攏來，晨曦卽起，入夜休息，連吸烟也一個個來，常德的每一個老百姓，為保身家，保性命，對此一利人利己的工程，無不踴躍參加。有三天，常德各大小軍政機關，自綏靖部及特務營至稅捐處，所有職員也參加，予築城民工無限興奮，常德各界近為他們發動一次慰勞，一天內就凑集豬肉一千斤，現款五千元，戲票五千張，但不平的事也有的，常德聚興誠銀行經理鄒振聲，自認為特權階級，與某人有熟，對此工程不出人不出錢，被羣衆由保長率領包圍住宅，喊設要和他說道理，他要整一下，在衆怒難犯下，在眞正的民意下，他低頭了，當塲鳴爆道歉，認出二百工，本當登報，因為面子，改為具結，羣衆始散。</p>
<p>從西門經東門迄北門，全長四千餘公尺，已恢復舊觀，在突出地帶，且增添了無數碉堡及機槍掩體，城墻上可行汽車，這並沒有浪費過一個錢工是義務勞動的，磚是捐的，材料是利用廢物的，這條環繞常德的鋼鍊，就是這樣緊張熱烈硬築起來的。從此，有匪防匪，有水防水，緊急時一經戒嚴歹徒卽易搜捕，而無數碉堡，將成為來常受訓各縣軍政幹部的示範敎具。</p>
<p>築城，修路，整水，是湘西人民力量一個最嚴酷的考騐，李默庵司令官一番為民努力的心血沒有落空，相信湘西從此該進步了。（本報記者柯以仁）</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕茲悉如馬歇爾須事長期休養，則國務卿一職，將由艾森豪威爾將軍繼任，馬歇爾定下星期中離醫院前赴北卡羅里納州派愛恩赫斯特之寓所，據其醫師聲稱，馬氏今後須休養數月。聞馬氏在經醫師施用手術前，曾與杜魯門總統晤談，謂渠經手術後，可能須作長時期休養，則願舉艾森豪為之繼，杜魯門殊以為然，惟艾氏是否受任，尙不可必。</p>
<p>衆信艾氏如果受任，則美國外交政策將不變動，因艾氏在戰時任盟軍統帥職，除決策發令外，且須融和各國主腦之意見，不啻以軍事家而兼外交家也。艾氏且與故總統羅斯福之國際政策密切有關，並嘗折衝史達林與故總統之爭衡。艾氏平日對於國際角逐中歐洲之地位，甚為注意，據接近艾氏者稱，艾氏殊贊助大西洋公約之原則，並主張予歐洲各國以軍事租借之援助，假使各國從事改新彼等之武裝。艾氏在其所著最近出版之「歐洲十字軍」一書中曾表示，縱在此際，渠對於蘇美兩國之關係，仿抱至大之樂觀。兩國制度雖甚相異，而渠極望彼此根據「生活而容各人生活」之槪念而獲默契。兩國生活大相歧異之槪念，可望融和而訂成具體與建設性之協定，此種樂觀似決不致消滅云。</p>

<p>— 礝石譯</p>
<p>從蘇聯到柏林這一塊廣大的區域內，照美國記者的報導，說是有着晴礁，並且也有反對莫斯科的共產黨在作着地下活動。動。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫狄托政權刻正在慫恿東歐反抗莫斯科的命令，在波籣，傾向莫斯科的共產黨和國家主義感的共產黨，正在公開對抗，捷克的共產黨，也發生着內鬨。</p>
<p>雖然在東歐，反抗莫斯科命令的共產黨還沒有勝利的預兆，但是這就已經使蘇聯寒心，所以它準備在東歐加細控制力量。</p>
<p>在東歐，共產黨的領導者為了要表示對蘇聯的忠誠，所以他們致力於討好莫斯科的工作。捷克和波蘭刻正在推行淸黨運動，同時這兩個國家對於一切行政採取高壓手段，是否遠反民意，却毫不顧及。</p>
<p>柏林東部是受穌聯控制的地域，他曾經慫恿德國共產黨佔領柏林市政府大廈，趕走了非共產黨的市政府。蘇聯駐德佔領軍不斷製造事件，對於柏林西區實施水陸封鎖，並威脅英美空運接濟，蘇聯所以採用這樣的手段，無非想接收柏林，擴充它的勢力範圍。</p>
<p>共產黨組織是直接受制於莫斯科，這也是蘇聯在「冷戰」中最好的法寳，因為那些國家的許多共產黨領導人物，都是不顧其本國國情而忠於莫斯科，但在東歐各國之中，却也右着愛國的共產黨員，致造成了莫斯科的不安。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·阿爾已尼亞·匈牙利·以及德奧蘇佔領區，都是直接受制於莫斯科的。波蘭·捷克乃是半受制於莫斯科的。至於芬蘭和南斯拉夫，現在是不依賴莫斯科，不聽蘇聯指令的國家。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫的共產黨獨裁者狄托，拒絕服從莫斯科的侖令，這却是蘇聯的心腹之患。在狄托事件發生以後幾星期中，蘇聯報紙為了聰取狄托的「認罪」而不加評論，但是狄托到底是沒有向莫斯科『賠罪』，於是他們就開始責備狄托的反叛，而狄托和其國內的輿論，相反地譴責莫斯科破壤共產黨之團結。同時他又大聲疾呼地向東歐共產黨公開宣言，請他們跟隨南斯拉夫的路綫，南斯拉夫在東歐的地位，是比較其他國家優良。支持莫斯科的，僅是南斯拉夫的少數人士，而支特狄托的却是大部分的南斯拉人民羣衆。其他的東歐國家則適得其反，因為統治那些國家的，乃是以莫斯科為後盾的少數共產黨，就是因為這個原因，所以那些國家不能像狄托一樣地公開抗拒莫斯科。但是狄托的事件，却給東歐的國家開闢了一條新路綫。</p>
<p>波蘭共產黨領袖間內鬨甚烈。波蘭副元首戈默爾基是受國內羣衆和共產黨員支持的人物，曾經因拒絕莫斯科的命令。而向蘇聯「認罪」，却引起了愛國共產黨之抗議和壞印象，於是也减弱了波蘭共產黨內的勢力。波蘭共產黨主要鬥爭目的，志在使所有彼蘭農民加人共產黨所主持的集體農塲，雖然波蘭的共產黨領導人物對於莫斯科的土地改革政策，是這樣地熱心遵奉，可是不幸得很，他的外交上却仍是沒有獲得莫斯科的好感。</p>
<p>波蘭共產黨對於德國的復活是很担憂，所以它常常反對莫斯科的統一德國和組織德國政府之計劃。另一方面，波蘭希望擴張其對西方的貿易，又在咀咒蘇聯的不接受馬歇爾援歐計劃，所以波蘭的反蘇陣綫已在暗地培養中。</p>
<p>捷克的共產黨政府更是困難重重。普拉格監獄裏現在充滿着在前總統貝納斯葬儀之日參加反蘇遊行的羣衆。在其東部的斯拉夫農民，他們都不願意以食物去支持現在的共產黨政府，同時，捷克的共產黨政府也正像波蘭一樣，在反對蘇聯的對德政策和欲擴充東西歐貿易。</p>
<p>東德在蘇軍佔領之下，共產黨的努力相當大，可是這些共產黨雖然在蘇聯的勢刀範圍內，却不主張蘇聯在該區運去大量的生產物資和拆卸該區的工廠，以充戰時的破壞賠償費用。至於東德的經濟情形，現在生產低於其二年復興計劃的目標，同時，因為蘇聯認為目前的東德共產黨並不是莫斯科的眞正信　，所以很不願意授權給他們，結果，東德的共產黨就更是不）滿意蘇聯政策。</p>
<p>其他的蘇聯衛星國，由於地利人和的種種關係，他們還不能不依賴莫斯科。阿爾巴尼亞的共產黨，自從狄托事件發生後，為了要向莫斯科表示忠誠，他就一面巴結莫斯科，一面公開譴責狄托反叛共產國際情報局。但是阿爾巴尼亞却懷着恐慌，因為他是南斯拉夫的毘鄰，唯恐南斯拉夫會因之而侵犯國境。於是接着就向莫斯科求援。蘇聯立卽派了一千名使節團去，並且其中以軍事使節團佔大多數。但是他巴結了莫斯科，却開罪了南斯拉夫。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞和保加利亞兩國，莫斯科對之很為關注，現在這二個國家的學校襄把蘇聯文字列為必修科之一。但是這兩國的共產黨政府却對於阻止其國內的國家主義運動是很傷腦筋。匈牙利的共產黨組織是很弱，現在靠着蘇聯駐軍的帮助而經營着政府，芬蘭雖然是蘇聯衛星國之一，但是却在非共產黨政府的統冶之下。莫斯科對於這政府是很不滿意，但是這政府却受着人民大衆的支持。總而言之東歐的共產黨圈子裏，是正在萌芽着反莫斯科的陣綫。蘇聯也知道這危機，所以他正在致力加細其衛星國的力量。（譯自「美國新聞和世界報吿」雜誌）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日本市物價稍平，中央銀行爲抽緊銀根抑平物價起見，重採拋售物資政策。計昨日拋出之花紗，價值二千四百萬金圓以上。故昨日紗布價格日圓小。而自下週一起，久鬆之銀根將轉緊。昨日本市之銀根，上午略緊，日拆一度高至二十元，尋因國家行局差出仍多，遂回降至十二元十五元之譜。金銀之黑市價格，昨日興前日相彷彿。米價則漲意仍濃。上白市塲最高做五百六十元，門售竟出六百大關。</p>
<p>〔聯合微信所訊〕近來市塲又起波動，金融嘗局爲平抑物價，安定民生起見，特於廿五日起繼續拋售物資，以紗布爲主。據中央銀行劉副總栽表示，拋售數量之多少，覦市塲需要而定。聞中央銀行物資委員會，巳凖備布兩萬疋，棉紗一萬件，隨時拋售。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市物價昨因各方吸意襄减，已轉趨下回。中央銀行方面對於此次漲風之應付，自經決定大量拋售紗布，拋售數量，則以市塲需要依歸。據該行人士預計，此次漲風，經各方配合應付後，日內卽可平息。</p>

<p>昨日米市繼續猛漲，因以一般物價看來，食米上漲比較尚少，貨主仍扳持甚力。晨開最屬緊俏，一時竟無人出樣，後交易漸開，價格上漲頗猛，北市塲特高粳一度喊高出六百元外，後因業外物價報疲，略見回低，特粳收市五百九十元，白粳薄稻爲五百六十元，各漲一百元。南市塲白粳五百四十五元，薄稻五百五十五元，前者漲一百〇五元，後者挺九十五元，臨收各米亦略轉疲，二市到貨共計一〇九四六石。</p>
<p>麵粉塲外有交易喊價再告上升，臨收轉降，結果仍見軋漲。初開因米價報漲，人心仍堅，貨主扳持依然甚力，老車兵船及各牌粉，大多均出二百元關外，老車開盤最高爲二百三十二元，後因業外各物下降，亦隨之轉降，老車收市二百十三元，仍軋漲八元，兵船由二百二十元開市，收市爲二百〇八元，計漲十八元，紅蜂建成大都漲七八元，麩皮亦先漲後回，軋升三四元。</p>

<p>現鈔籌碼，亦告微歛。工商行號，紛紛支發負工年終獎金，需要頗鉅。前晚行莊軋單較遲，在央行餘額减少，以致影響昨日提支。聞昨日大鈔貼水奇昂，達每千元六十或入十元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據息：管理進出口貿易新辦法公佈實施後，輸管倉前爲推廣輸出所制定施行之「輪出品製造原料輸入辦法」，與「出口商裝運出口貨物所需包裝材料准予特許進口之辦法」仍屬有效，按該兩項辦法規定凡輸出工業品·如橡膠·熱水瓶·草帽·搪瓷器等之廠家，得利用其所得出口外匯之一部份，以輸入其製造原料。至於營運農工畜產品之出口商，亦准其以所得出口外匯之一部份，申請輸入實際需用之外國包裝材料。其用意蓋在於使輸出工業品之廠家，能運用其本身獲得之出口外匯，直接向國外定購原料及包裝材料。此項輸入，旣母須進口商登記合格之資格，又不受限額分配之限制，對於經營外銷工業品之廠商協助頗大·聞該會過去辦理之成績甚佳，極能補助新頒進出口貿易辦法，以收實施商品連鎖及促進輸出之效能云。</p>

<p>— 本報特約記者　　子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港廿三日航訊〕紅袍白髮的聖誔老人，今年未把他的禮物送給香港人之前，好像過去兩三年間他訪問共他城市一樣，先帶來了一塲驚人的災難：一架「空中霸王」廿一日下午二時左右，在香港東北十多哩的拜亞士深低空，和「火石鳥」的山頭相撞，立刻毀滅了三十三條性命。霧中飛行的危險，又在人們的腦袋裏加深了一層暗影。</p>
<p>「空中霸王」遇難者　一半焚斃一半跌死</p>
<p>據從災塲回來的目擊者說：失事的「空中霸王」，斷為兩截，上半截擱在山頭，已遭焚燬。下半載墮落山坑，破壞不堪。看情形，那些遇難者總有一部份是跌斃而不是燒死者。一個接近航空界的人說：啓德機塲因為香港上空視界已給濃霧掩蔽，巳電吿那架霸王轉道廣州降落，不知為了什麼，他却從雲縫中撞山而粉身碎骨了。</p>

<p>今天中國航空公司香港辦事處的門前，人來人往，特別擁擠，轉過一個彎，也發現一堆人，不過前者是打探飛機失事消息的人，後者是等候買票聽馬連良唱戲的觀衆。在這一塲悲劇和一塲喜劇的看客中也以「上海客」佔了多數。差不多在同一時間裏，李麗劇團和馬連良劇團分別在香港中區兩大戲院上演，這是戰後首次演出的京戲，不懂京話而慕名前往的也頗不乏人。這半月來，香港「政治舞台」上的演出，也呈相當熱鬧，龍雲抵港促成了這齣戲的高潮。</p>

<p>香港對岸九龍半島的尖端，也有另一個十分熟鬧的塲面，戰後第一次的香港「國貨」展覽會，正在半鳥酒店側面的曠地上舉行。在這個展覽會中，人們便看到一些上海逃港資金在香港設廠的生產面。儘管國貸展覽會大吹大擂，但聖誕市塲裏的各大公司貨物，部以日本貨佔大多數，那簡直是一個大諷刺！「今年的聖誕禮物，比去年便宜」，香港人異口同聲的說，但今年的市塲却比去年冷落，可見在中國經濟沒有辦法中，香港也無法繁榮。</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Tianjin, 25th] The focus of the North China war situation has shifted towards Tanggu.  Artillery battles have been fierce in recent days.  At 2:00 AM on the 25th, the bandit 9th Column's 25th Division launched a fierce attack towards Honglou, southwest of Dagu, resulting in intense fighting throughout the day.  As of the evening, the two sides were still in a standoff. Non-military organizations have all been evacuated to Xingang, where fortifications have been completed with the cooperation of the navy.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Military News:  Lin Biao's 9th Column launched an offensive yesterday morning against the National Army's positions along the Tieshan line southwest of Dagu.  The National Army met the attack with fierce resistance. The bandits employed human wave tactics, launching dozens of attacks within three hours.  Supported by naval artillery, the National Army engaged the bandits in fierce combat for four hours, killing and wounding over 2,000 bandits.  The bandits retreated along the entire line.  Around 12:00 noon, the bandits launched another counterattack, with fierce fighting continuing until dusk.  The bandit 9th Column was ultimately defeated, suffering over 3,000 killed and wounded.  Today's battles were quiet.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Tianjin, 25th]  No sound of cannons has been heard in Tianjin for two nights.  There were no major battles in the surrounding areas today either.  A regiment of the bandit 2nd Column was discovered in Wujiazui, southeast of Tianjin, and a bandit regiment was found in Huidui, south of Tianjin, but there has been no intense fighting yet.  Furthermore, Tianjin security authorities launched a city-wide household census on the evening of the 24th.  Over 2,000 groups began simultaneously and completed the census within twelve hours.  The authorities are determined to eliminate all illegal elements.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 25th] Military News: National Army infantry and cavalry units patrolled and mopped up the outskirts of Tianjin yesterday and today. No trace of bandits was found within twenty *li* northwest and northeast of Tianjin.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 25th]  Snowflakes fluttered in the ancient capital on Christmas. This morning, National Army forces outside Guang'anmen conducted searches in multiple directions towards bandit forces in Lianhua Pond, the Racecourse, Luodao Village west of Yiyi, Shifangyuan, and the Caishen Temple area southwest of the city. There were minor skirmishes between the two sides. It is reported that the bandit forces around Beiping have not retreated and are constructing fortifications in the distant suburbs, seemingly with the intention of besieging the ancient capital. The area between Wanshou Mountain west of Beiping and Guang'anmen is still occupied by Lin Biao's 5th Column.  Bandits north of Beiping are currently entrenched in Qinghe and Shahe.  National Army forces in the eastern suburbs control the area between Tong County, ten *hua li* west, and Beiping.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Tianjin, 25th] It is reported that a powerful cavalry brigade of the National Army, previously ordered to launch a lightning strike and mop-up operation in eastern Hebei, has now reached the Yutian County area in eastern Hebei, striking hard at the bandits' rear.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 25th] Last night passed peacefully. Awakening, Beiping had become a silver-clad world, with various scenes resembling vivid picture postcards. Around the city walls, not a single gunshot broke the silence. There continues to be talk of the Communist troops shifting towards Central China. According to a spokesman for the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, this is quite possible.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Bengbu, 25th] Military News: The main force of the National Army on the southern front is currently north of the Fei River. Recent weather conditions have caused a lull in the fighting. On the northern front, the pressure on General Du's army corps has indeed decreased.  The serial numbers of Chen Yi's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 9th Columns, as well as the rebel Wu Huawen's troops, which were previously encircling the positions, have not been seen in recent days, and their whereabouts are unknown. However, with continuous rain and snow, air force activity is difficult, and the arduous conditions of General Du's army corps can be imagined. In the Huainan area, local Communist forces are limited to Sun Chuanjia's troops, who are harassing the area near Hujiaji. According to today's intelligence, these bandit troops have again moved to Hongxipu.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Bengbu, 25th] The Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced: (1) Although there has been heavy snow everywhere in recent days, General Li's army corps between the Xie and Fei rivers is maintaining strict vigilance in its original positions and dispatching troops for deep reconnaissance. The bandits are unable to flee south. (2) Chen Yi's bandits in the northeast Yongcheng area have suffered heavy casualties from General Du's army corps' artillery bombardment. Coupled with the cold weather and snow, many bandits have died from hunger and cold.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Today, at least two divisions of troops, fully equipped and well-armed, mixed with cavalry and tanks, passed through Nanjing on their way to the Bengbu front for reinforcement.</p>

(2) The case of Zhang Dexian, Director of the Sichuan Land Administration Bureau, being derelict in his duties will be changed to a censure case, which will still be proposed by the three committee members of the Sichuan-Xikang Administrative Office, Tan Wenjie, Gesang Yexi, and Lu Fengge, and sent to the Yuan for handling. (3) To correct the Executive Yuan's failure to promptly establish the Shandong Provincial Government and set up a joint office for the nine northeastern provinces and two cities to facilitate the implementation of administrative orders, Zhao Jixun and Mei Gongren were appointed to revise the wording of the correction proposal and submit it to the Yuan immediately.</p>

<p>Xinyang Becomes Political Center</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinyang, 25th] Today, Xinyang is not only a forward base for the National Army but has also become the political center of Henan. Under the leadership of General Zhang Zhen, the military and political sides are gradually expanding with Xinyang as the center. Zhang has repeatedly emphasized that no matter how the situation changes, the Henan Provincial Government will remain within the province. To adapt to this situation, the Henan Provincial Government has completed its wartime structure. In addition to abolishing seventeen unnecessary subordinate agencies, the number of personnel in all subordinate units has also been reduced from over 1,500 in Kaifeng to 150. Those who are laid off will receive three months' salary for those who voluntarily disperse, while those who are willing to work in the countryside will be assigned to work in the areas where the government is located, organizing provincial government supervisory groups, work teams, and township-level grassroots political guidance groups to work in different districts and receive their original salaries, with subsidies provided when necessary.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Zhou Yide Tells United Press Reporter That Military Aid to China Is Not Too Late; Blames Truman and Marshall's Policies as Erroneous <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Washington, 25th Broadcast: Republican Congressman Zhou Yide told a United Press reporter that "If President Truman and the State Department are willing to take responsibility for China's failure to the Communists, then Congress has no way to prevent them from taking such measures." When Congress is reorganized, Congressman Zhou will be a member of the minority party but will still be an important member of the House of Representatives. He is considered by other congressmen to be the main spokesman for the pro-China aid group. Therefore, he told reporters that he believes Congress is unlikely to exceed the government's position on military aid to the Chinese government forces, which he considers significant. He explained, "During the last session of Congress, I forced the government to take action to make military and reconstruction aid to China part of the Economic Cooperation Act, but subsequent developments have proved that although the law can be passed, its implementation cannot be controlled. If Truman and Marshall are unwilling to aid China, then we congressmen can do nothing."</p>
<p>Zhou said: If Roosevelt had been willing to sell out China ten years ago, the war against Japan might not have happened. However, Roosevelt and Hull were willing to accept war rather than accept destruction. If Roosevelt and Hull's decision was correct, then today Truman and Marshall's decision to allow the Communists to destroy China's independence is a major mistake. If the United States insists on forcing China to form a coalition government that includes the Communists, the consequences will undoubtedly create a second Czechoslovakia or Poland. It is not too late for the United States to take effective action today.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng recently met with United Press reporters alone and clarified that Sun Ke's new cabinet is determined to continue fighting the Communists until the Communists sue for peace. Wu said, "The sole objective of the new government is to continue fighting the Communists until they need peace and understand that peace is very important to the country. The current cabinet is a wartime cabinet, not a surrender cabinet." It is reported that Wu has always been one of President Chiang's closest advisors and is currently tasked with planning the policies of the new wartime cabinet. Wu expressed optimism in unmistakable terms that even though the National Army has been suffering repeated defeats, the new government has hope, and in addition to revitalizing and mobilizing the areas still in the government's hands south of the Yangtze River to fight the Communists, there are no other plans. He said, "The new government will strengthen the defenses of Jiangnan, promote production, provide manpower and new troops to revitalize the troops still in the north." Wu Tiecheng continued that it is too early to announce any new policies, but at the same time, it can be said that the blueprint is being drafted. According to this plan, the military service system will be re-examined, and huge manpower will be turned into a large number of troops. "This will be a comprehensive effort, and everything needed to continue the war against the Communists will be done." We will continue to fight until the Communists are the ones who sue for peace in the future.</p>
<p>The same optimistic spirit expressed by Wu is also quite evident in other aspects. In addition, there is also a clear and unusual image of full cooperation between the more important departments within the government, with each knowing what the other is doing and cooperating with each other.</p>
<p>No one denies the seriousness of the situation, but at the same time, very few senior government officials express pessimism about the future. A senior government official indicated that the Communists suffered greater losses than the National Army in the battles of northern Jiangsu, Xuzhou, and Bengbu. He also made a series of remarks to prove this point, saying that if the Communist army had truly achieved the major victories they claimed, they would have quickly taken advantage of the good opportunity. "If the Communist army had the upper hand, they would not have given up taking the offensive. The Communist army was forced to abandon the offensive to replenish their strength and reorganize in order to find another way to attack the Yangtze River." He pointed to Tanggu as the main target of Lin Biao's troops in North China, followed by Tianjin, and said that Beiping has no strategic value for the Communists, so the Communists are unwilling to sacrifice troops to capture General Fu Zuoyi's main base of operations.</p>
<p>Summarizing the opinions of senior officials in the new government gives the impression that they have not given up hope and do not expect a collapse in the future. On the other hand, the carefully worded statements of senior officials have never failed to mention peace talks. At the same time, they are equally careful not to explicitly state that peace must be initiated by the Communist side. However, there is undoubtedly some behind-the-scenes peace work underway, and there is clear evidence of this. The news given to the United Press by some of the most reputable Chinese and foreign figures in Nanjing is proof of this.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Total US Military Aid to China After Victory Amounted to US$230 Million; US Newspaper Reports of US$2-3 Billion Are Inaccurate <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Chinese officials here said on the 24th that since the surrender of Japan, direct US military aid to China has totaled US$230 million. This number is far from the claim in some newspapers that such military aid totaled US$2 billion to US$3 billion. Chinese officials said that only a portion of the US$230 million in military aid, such as useful small arms and ammunition, has actually been delivered to China since the end of the war. China is officially publicizing the figures for aid on the Chinese side, and this number has been debated extensively in the press. In the past, China has tried to debate it carefully, fearing biased intentions. However, the official Chinese authority and officials believe that in the opinion of whether or not it is the United Press, there are slight differences in the basic viewpoint between the opinions of China and the United States on "Aid to China." The Chinese side said: "For example, the surplus materials that are being damaged on the Pacific islands should only be calculated at the recent sale price, while the US largely calculates this at the original production cost in the transfer of aid to China." US and Chinese officials have long disputed the book value figures of the surplus materials stipulated by the US Army Department. The Chinese side said that the recent reports in the United States that the total aid to China since the surrender of Japan has reached US$2 billion or US$3 billion are inaccurate and deliberately exaggerated.</p>
<p>"According to the estimates of the Chinese authorities, the total amount of US aid and loans to China in the three and a half years from the surrender of Japan to the present is US$1,173,300,000, most of which is for relief and civilian supplies, and the total amount of military supplies in the same period is US$230 million. "US aid can be divided into three types: first, gifts or loans; second, surplus materials; and third, service fees. The total amount of gifts and loans is US$1,173,000,000, including US donations to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and other international relief plans, totaling US$518,000,000 for the US foreign relief program, US$145,000,000 in loans, US$110,000,000 in military supplies under the Lend-Lease Act, and US$400 million in the 1948 Aid to China Act, of which US$125 million is for military supplies. Some of the materials under the 1948 Aid to China Act have not yet been delivered to China. The second type of surplus materials is US$199,300,000, which is the most debated figure. China calculates its value based on the purchase price, while the US value is based on the production value of US$820 million. The third type of "service fees" is US$377,000,000. This number is calculated by the US and is for the service fees for reprocessing and Japanese reparations. The Chinese side said that this amount is almost half of the amount of the Lend-Lease Act given to China, and China cannot correctly consider this to be direct aid to China. The most difficult of all aid to China issues is the accurate number of war materials shipped to China. According to the base report to the United Press, what China needs most in the war against communism is small arms, such as rifles, machine guns, and ammunition. According to a Chinese report, from the surrender of Japan to October 1948, China received only 50 million rounds of ammunition, worth US$2 million, and 130 million rounds of 7.92 mm ammunition. The first batch arrived shortly after the surrender of Japan, and the second batch did not arrive until 1947. The US government estimates the value of the second batch of ammunition to be US$6,564,992. The Chinese side said that they cannot accept this book value because the actual sale price was US$656,499. The Chinese side also said that since October 1948, there have been four shipments to China under the US$125 million military aid project, the first shipment being 600 tons and the other three shipments totaling 12,000 tons. The first and second shipments have arrived in China, and the remaining two shipments are on their way to China. Since the surrender of Japan, the total amount of military supplies received by China is less than US$230 million, including military supplies under the surplus materials project and the US$125 million military aid plan. They also stated that of the US$728,000,000 Lend-Lease Act listed by the United States, US$337,000,000 was for handling fees and not materials, and for the remaining difference, the Chinese side stated that they only received invoices for US$110 million. The different opinions on the price are being negotiated. The Chinese side also pointed out that the Lend-Lease Act received by China was very limited, a far cry from the US$11 billion in Lend-Lease programs received by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Chinese officials announced on the 24th that since the day of victory over Japan, the total amount of credit loans obtained by China from the United States was US$202,800,000 (including US$82,800,000), but there was still US$16,000,000 that had not been allocated, so the actual difference was US$186,800,000.</p>
<p>They said that China had already repaid US$132,000,000, and the overdue difference was US$54,800,000.</p>
<p>They also said: "The Chinese government and people are certainly deeply grateful to the US government for the massive assistance given to China, but especially today, when the issue of expanding assistance is under consideration, the explanation and statement regarding this assistance must be factual in order to prevent any exaggeration or misunderstanding."</p>

<h3 id="e23">Scientific Research in China and the United States <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Kaifu</p>
<p>China and the United States are both important countries in the world. The differences in the economic situations of the two countries are well known. A comparison of the state of scientific research in the two countries may not be without significance.</p>
<p>Theoretical science is the mother of applied science, and applied science is the foundation for improving material life. Americans are most fond of enjoyment, and their advocacy of engineering science can be said to be the same as improving agriculture. Major factories deeply understand that improving products cannot be achieved without thoroughly researching the principles of each product. Therefore, they compete to establish research departments, hire pure scientists, and research day and night. The equipment and talent in each research department are at least equivalent to any research institute in our country, and the scope of their research is often limited to three or several types of manufacturing. No wonder their products are constantly improving.</p>
<p>Newly emerging factories in our country, such as the Shenxin Textile Factory, have also known in recent years to hire scientific personnel to guide production, and the results are quite impressive. However, they are only responsible for guidance, and there is no establishment of research departments, let alone equipment specially designed for research. It is said that the success of literature depends on talent; the progress of science depends on equipment. Without equipment, there is no way to discover new knowledge; without new knowledge, there is no way to talk about improvement. The main reason why our country's industrial products cannot be compared with foreign ones is this.</p>
<p>There is an even more obvious contrast between the research departments of government agencies in China and the United States. During the war, the U.S. military organization expanded, and in the U.S. capital alone, it recruited more than a hundred geographers from China and abroad. A year before the landing in Europe, they had already studied the possibilities and gains and losses of landing at various locations. Before attacking Germany, the general staff had already calculated the route for advancing into Berlin, as well as the difficulty of each route and how to overcome it. In order to prepare for landing in our country to attack the Japanese army, they also collected a lot of information and made more than a hundred kinds of military maps of our country's coast. "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." The Americans can be said to have deeply understood its essence. Even in peacetime, the U.S. State Department also employs specialized scholars to study the resources of various countries and other construction issues. Today, in the Consulate General in Shanghai, there are still people who specialize in collecting various geographical materials from our country and sending them back to the United States for research. Ah, understanding the national conditions is the key to diplomatic negotiations. How could our Ministry of Foreign Affairs not know this! It's just that due to limited funds, they have more than they can do. Envoys to foreign countries are already overwhelmed by the shortage of publicity funds, how can they have the extra strength to hire people to run around for inquiries and searches?</p>
<p>The research institutions of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are even more grand and thorough. For each crop or livestock, there are several experts responsible for research. The methods and techniques for selecting seeds, eliminating diseases, and increasing production are available for farmers to inquire and ask for assistance. Agricultural meteorology, water and soil conservation, agricultural product transportation, and agricultural economics also have special departments for research. Each province has an agricultural department, and each department emphasizes both business and research. Under the department, there are local experimental stations and farms. Each farm often has research reports, and each department has even more publications. The department itself has even more publications, and they are especially valuable.</p>
<p>Our country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also has a Central Experimental Institute, a Forestry Experimental Institute, and other similar institutions engaged in research, promotion, and guidance. The research staff of each institute is carefully selected, and their publications are of special value. It is a pity that the same institutions cannot be popularized in various places. The equipment and talent of the agricultural and forestry departments of each province are mostly not sufficient. A certain director of the agricultural and forestry department knew that the publications of the department were not complete, and once advised the author not to adopt them. He was originally a pure scholar, otherwise he would never have confessed so frankly. His words of advice to the author are enough to reflect his sadness and emotion. A certain county agricultural extension center has a farm of more than one hundred acres, and the entire center has two staff members, one is an agricultural scholar and the other is a transferred military officer. The military officer was good at fighting and had been ordered to be placed by the county government, but there was no suitable position, so he was assigned to agricultural extension work! The "innate deficiency and acquired maladjustment" of research institutions has reached this point! The author sincerely hopes that the farm is the only example in the country.</p>
<p>Among the government agencies in our country that are dedicated to pure research work, the Academia Sinica and the Peiping Research Institute have better equipment. The United States does not have this kind of government agency, and many important countries do not have it either. Our country can indeed be proud of this. The Academia Sinica has thirteen research institutes, and the Peiping Research Institute has nine. In addition, there are also the Marine Research Institute, the Geodetic Survey Institute, the _______ Research Institute, and the Geographic Research Institute established by the Sino-British Education Fund and the Ministry of Education. There are also the Central Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of various provinces, as well as the Soil Research Institute, the Fujian Provincial Academy of Sciences, etc. University professors teach and research at the same time, while research institute staff are spared the trouble of teaching. Since the work is preferential, the selection of personnel is more strict. No matter how good the work results are, they cannot be research fellows without reaching considerable qualifications. Because of this, even if the equipment of the research institute is very simple, it still has considerable reputation abroad. During the Anti-Japanese War, life was extremely hard, but the research institutes were still able to publish research reports as usual. We are certainly not complacent about this, but American scholars have been amazed. There are also some research institutes that have not accumulated funds during the Anti-Japanese War, and the researchers have exhausted their efforts to ensure that each institute continues to exist. The inspiring and tearful struggle process is even more unimaginable to Americans.</p>
<p>The United States does not have government-run research institutions, but it has privately run research organizations. The Smithsonian Institution and the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., are examples of this. The research scope of the two academies is not broad, but they all have sufficient funds, and there is absolutely no shortage of funds. The addition of equipment is entirely up to the researchers. The achievements of the two academies have long been world-renowned. The publications of the Smithsonian Institution in biology and anthropology and the Carnegie Institution in botany are considered first-class works. This is of course the performance of the researchers' efforts. If the environment is not stable and the equipment is sufficient, how can it be expressed? If our country's research institutions can add equipment as the researchers want, how do we know that their achievements will not make American scholars admire even more?</p>
<p>Since there are fewer research institutions in the United States, most of the research work is done by university professors. Indeed, the reason why university professors are different from primary and secondary school teachers is that they can constantly obtain new facts and constantly update their knowledge and insights. Without research opportunities to discover new knowledge, teaching according to the book, and parroting what others say, then the university is a continuation of the middle school, how can it achieve the purpose of training research talents? The treatment of American university professors, generally speaking, is less than that of government officials, and even less than that of factory technicians. However, each department's main teachers (who can be associate professors or assistant professors) each have a secretary to organize their manuscripts. Better universities can also hire more people to compile their materials for the professor's research. Taking geography teachers as an example, if they need to go to a distant place for inspection during the holidays, the school can pay for it. It can be seen that the school not only cultivates students, but also cultivates teachers. How is the treatment of professors in our country? It is not necessary to discuss this in depth. But to give one example, a certain professor, because the income from his monthly income could not afford to send his children to school, once said to the author: "I can only teach my children not to study anymore, because I am afraid that after studying, they will also be like me who cannot support their children." The sad groans are unbearable to hear, how can American professors imagine this?</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign scholars all acknowledge that if students or teachers in our country can study hard abroad, their learning or research results will definitely not be behind anyone; when they return to China, they will gradually degenerate. Here, we can't help but feel the sorrow of being transplanted. If this is due to individual depravity, then why not be depraved in the easy and carefree life abroad, but be depraved in the land of propriety and righteousness?</p>
<p>In recent years, the political situation in Europe has been unstable, especially in Germany. American universities have taken advantage of this opportunity to recruit as much talent as possible. As a result, the world's first-class scholars have gradually concentrated in the United States, especially in the fields of physics, mathematics, chemistry, and meteorology. These scholars are not all Jewish. After coming to the United States, because of peace of mind and prosperity, their work is even more energetic. It can be seen that the progress of science lies in the spirit, especially in the environment. If it is said that the relationship between science and prosperity is purely an internal change of scientific personnel, may I ask why European scholars must go to the United States? Germany has always been known as the garden of science. Why has science made no progress in the years of war, while the United States has made rapid progress? Only if scientific personnel can settle down in the United States can the United States, which has not produced first-class theoretical scientists before, become a hub of science after being brewed by the first-class scholars.</p>
<p>Our government must have fully understood the difficulties faced by our scientific workers. I firmly believe that it will gradually improve them. It is heard that the research departments of military institutions have excellent equipment. I firmly believe that the government will be able to use this to infer the other, and strive to make all research institutions have excellent equipment, so that science can develop universally and not be subject to special restrictions. The other day, I read Mr. Li Chunyuan's article "The Crisis of China's Science Career" (Shanghai Dagong Bao, August 22), and I deeply admire the correctness of his views and the effective solution. Recently, I read Mr. Xu Foguan's article "Another Crisis of China's Science Career", and I can't help but feel a lot of emotion. I offer what I know to ask for advice from experts. The author only hopes that the domestic science career will develop smoothly, and seeing benevolence and wisdom is not what I care about.</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Control Yuan Proposes an Impeachment Case Against the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings, Requesting Prompt Adjustment and Punishment of Weng Wei and Thomas <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 55th] Supervisory Committee members Tang Honglie and Ren Bingjun believe that the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings and its subordinate bodies should promptly make reasonable improvements and adjustments in the entire organizational structure, as well as in internal organization, personnel, powers, and operations. Weng Wei, General Manager of the Subordinate Materials Supply General Warehouse, is difficult to shirk the blame for negligence, and Thomas, Deputy Manager of the Automobile Management Office, privately sold automobile parts, which is not without corruption. An impeachment case has been proposed, requesting the Control Yuan to forward it to the Executive Yuan for careful handling and to be dealt with according to the law in order to maintain international credibility and emphasize the rule of law. The Control Yuan has entrusted Committee members Ma Qingduan, Qi Shixun, Yang Qunxian, and Liang Tiancai to review the case and it has been established. The case has been referred to the Executive Yuan for handling. The report of Committee member Ma and others' review decision is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Committee members Tang Honglie and Ren Bingjun impeached the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings, Weng Wei, General Manager of the Materials Supply General Warehouse, for dereliction of duty, and Thomas, Deputy Manager of the Automobile Management Office, for privately selling automobile parts. After joint review by the committee members, they unanimously agreed that Deputy Manager Thomas of the Automobile Management Office of the Materials Supply General Warehouse privately sold twelve automobile parts to Hengyuhao in Shanghai in June and July of this year. Moreover, among the four spare parts sold to Hengxinghao on July 5, each part was priced at only 2 million yuan, while Hengxinghao had already resold the above four spare parts to the China Relief Corps on June 26, with a selling price of 5 million yuan each. That is, the deputy manager sold public property without approval, which is not in accordance with the law. Moreover, Hengxinghao had already resold the above four spare parts to other parties at a high price on June 26, which proves that the price ticket issued by the Automobile Management Office on July 5 was obviously false. However, Weng Wei, General Manager of the General Warehouse, did not investigate and close the case, which is difficult to shirk the blame for dereliction of duty. It should be requested that the Executive Yuan forward the case to the Executive Yuan to punish Weng Wei, General Manager of the Materials Supply General Warehouse of the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings, and Thomas, Deputy Manager of the subordinate Automobile Management Office, according to the law. Furthermore, the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee lacks specialized technical personnel, and most of the committee members are part-time, unable to devote themselves wholeheartedly. The various business plans are mostly restricted by the Custody Committee, so that the committee affairs cannot be actively carried out. Most of the Chinese committee members of the Custody Committee are also part-time, and do not often attend meetings. Most important decisions are decided by foreign committee members, and many institutions are added to the committee outside the statutory organization. The total number of staff members reaches several thousand, which is considered excessive. Its administrative expenses and business expenses are used independently from the custody funds, and the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee has no power to supervise and verify in practice. Moreover, the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee is located in Nanjing, while the Custody Committee is located in Shanghai, which is inconvenient for contact. It should also be requested that the Executive Yuan be notified to make reasonable improvements and adjustments to the Post-War Rehabilitation Undertakings Committee and its subordinate Custody Committee in terms of the entire organizational structure, business operations, and powers and personnel.</p>

However, this is only a temporary phenomenon, which is actually caused by the unsound psychology of the people. It is believed that after the improved method of deposit exchange is announced, prices will return to stability. When asked by reporters whether it was true that the amount of gold and silver deposits for exchange would be appropriately increased, Wang said that all speculations were premature in the process of studying the new method.</p>

<h3 id="e42">The First Sound of Construction in Western Hunan: Harnessing Rivers, Building Roads <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Changde dispatch on the 20th] Many people who do not understand Western Hunan think that this place is strange and mysterious. In fact, it is not. It's just that feudal latent forces are rampant, transportation is blocked, and some aspects are more backward than the "Lower Yangtze" region. At present, Western Hunan can be considered a temporarily safe haven in the overall military situation of suppressing the rebellion. Seeking construction in stability is the key measure of Commander Li Mo'an. The two major projects recently called for by Li are rapidly unfolding with the support of the people.</p>
<p>Developing Resources, Harnessing the Yuan River</p>
<p>The Yuan River is the main artery of nourishment in Western Hunan. It originates in the mountains of Liping, Guizhou, passes through more than 20 counties, meanders eastward, and flows into Dongting Lake from Hanshou, with a total length of over 2,000 li. Important products in the basin include gold, coal, mercury, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron, medicinal materials, fir, bamboo, and tung oil, which is the main commodity for earning foreign exchange. However, the upper reaches are mostly mountainous, which is not conducive to navigation. There are five or six dangerous shoals in the middle reaches. The loss of life and property of the people over the years is countless. The downstream exit is gradually silting up, which will become a disaster. However, the harnessing project is huge. At the end of last month, Li Mo'an summoned the county magistrates, speakers, chairmen of chambers of commerce, local gentry, and experts from various counties in the basin to Changde and held an extremely important and decisive meeting. The steps of the entire project were decided, the difficulties that could not be solved over the years were resolved, and all technical problems were solved. Therefore, the full-scale construction started on the 10th of this month. The organization of this vast water conservancy project is that the Yuan River Project Committee is set up under the 17th Pacification Headquarters and the Hunan Yuan River Basin Planning and Development Committee. Project offices or engineering offices are set up in important project areas, and a large number of engineering consultants and expert committees are hired. Taking advantage of the low water period, it will be completed in twelve months in the next two years.</p>
<p>The most difficult blasting of reefs and chiseling of shoals in the middle reaches has been put out for tender to clear the rubble. As for the Tuan River project, the people are mobilized for voluntary labor, and food subsidies are provided. The project cost is estimated to be 100,000 shi of grain. Hanshou County is the main stream of the Yuan River, injecting into the total mouth of Dongting Lake. Since the collapse of the Dawei Dam, the Yuan River has not followed its old course, resulting in a high riverbed and siltation at the entrance of the main stream, obstructing navigation, and even threatening the drinking water problem in Hanshou. At the same time, from spring to summer, the water cannot be regulated, and the lives and property of Hanshou County are bound to suffer. Therefore, many project offices and engineering offices are set up in this section. The project cost is estimated to be 137,750 US dollars. The first phase started at the beginning of this month and will last until May next year. Speaker Bao of Hanshou has guaranteed that 50,000 laborers can be mobilized, and there is no problem with funding. Every mu of field can automatically donate 4 to 5 dou of rice. Because the benefits of the harnessing are the greatest for Hanshou, and the enclosed lake fields can reach 170,000 mu. The Doushan irrigation project in Changde mainly involves guiding the tributaries of the Yuan River to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of farmland in the Doushan area and can prevent droughts. It also started this month. A roller dam, raft channel, sluice gate, flood control dike, thorn sluice, diversion sluice, culvert, inverted flood pipe, flood reduction sluice, flood discharge sluice, temporary bridge, and 38,000 cubic meters of earthwork will be built in the upper reaches of the tributary. The project cost is estimated to be 60,000 US dollars. The central government has approved a subsidy of 55,200 yuan, and the entire project is estimated to be completed by the end of September next year.</p>
<p>According to the planned target, after the completion of this water conservancy project, ships and bamboo rafts with a load of 300 city dan can be installed and can be smoothly opened from Qinglang Shoal to Changde all year round. Below Changde, 300-ton or more transport ships can be navigated all year round, and the products of the basin can be exported smoothly. In the upper reaches, hydropower can be used to generate electricity and start various electric power industries. The completion of the Changde Doushan irrigation project can increase rice production by 30,000 zu per year. But a huge amount of money is currently lying in the mud? The people of Western Hunan firmly answer: We have endless manpower. In addition, the authorities are planning to levy a tax rate of 2% to 5% on water transportation products such as bamboo, wood, cotton, gallnuts, tung oil, paper, and tobacco. The people of Western Hunan are now happy to pay any price for this great project and work together.</p>
<p>Facilitating Transportation, Opening Up Roads</p>
<p>Opening the map of Western Hunan, with Changde as the center, in addition to the Changtao Highway, the Changyuan section of the Xiangqian Highway, and the Changchang Highway, there is a blank space in the vast area in between. There is not a single inch of road in the eight districts of Western Hunan. According to the resolution of the last pacification meeting, the Pacification Headquarters established the Military Road Construction Committee. The chief engineer of the Provincial Highway Bureau was sent to participate. The committee set up 23 construction sections. The local county magistrate served as the chief of the section. The first phase of the project first launched the Changde to Taoyuan, Cili to Yexian, Shimen to Cili, Cili to Dayong, and other lines. At the end of last month, Commander Li Mo'an convened a meeting of various counties and relevant personnel. In order to save time, it was decided to use the slack season of farming and adopt voluntary labor to start with the Changci, Ciji, and Ciyong lines. At the beginning of this month, various stations started construction at the same time.</p>
<p>The Changci Highway is 90 kilometers long, with two-thirds of it in Taoyuan. The Changtao section was built before the war and was destroyed during the war. The Taoci section started construction in 1945, but it has not been completed in the past three years. The county magistrate of Taoyuan said to the reporter that he is an official who cannot reach the top or bottom. Therefore, he is working very hard this time. Although he has been transferred to the province, he firmly stated that he would complete this road in his hands. He personally supervises the construction on the road and is obviously very hard. More than 2,000 laborers fetch sand from the river as far as five li away every day. Nearly 10,000 labor heroes sweat on the road without fatigue. In order to rescue themselves from poverty, their work mood is excited. The sweat is not shed in vain. County Magistrate Duan affirmed: In another 28 sunny days, the Changci Highway can be fully opened to traffic. The earthwork, bridges, and culverts from Cili to Yexian need to be newly built from scratch. The magistrate of Linye County worked barefoot, wearing straw sandals, and supervised the construction on the road in the rain. Sometimes he also dug a hoe. More than 10,000 laborers are working enthusiastically and nervously. The scene is said to be unprecedented. The Ciyong line is a new road along the Ye River, and it is also a tentacle inserted into the district for the first time. The project is more extensive than other lines. Cili is now concentrating all its efforts on the Cinong line, and this side is temporarily relaxed. But the general office of the section has been established, and let's see how much power Dayong County can spare.</p>
<p>Waterproof and Bandit-proof, Building the City of Changde</p>
<p>The reporter wants to report on another huge city building project: Changde has an ancient, old, and broken city wall. Many corners have collapsed into flat ground, and everyone can freely enter and exit. Only the area around the South Gate is still intact because it prevents the water of the Yuan River from rushing in, so it is constantly being repaired. However, if there are floods in spring and summer, relying on the corner of the South Gate alone will not help. Once a flood occurs, the lives and property of Changde City will inevitably suffer incalculable disasters. Especially in today's turbulent times, in order to consolidate the city's defenses, based on the call to protect property from bankruptcy and protect life at all costs, the reconstruction of the city wall in Changde has started again.</p>
<p>The City Defense Department specially set up an engineering team, and Deputy Commander Wang Mingsheng is responsible for on-site supervision and guidance. Commander Li Mo'an and other senior officials are all personally involved. Construction started on the 27th of last month. More than 5,000 laborers have no salary and no complaints. Men, women, old and young, from every village within 40 li, gather together, get up at dawn, and rest at night. Even smoking is done one by one. Every citizen of Changde is enthusiastically participating in this project that benefits others and themselves in order to protect their family and lives. For three days, all military and political organs in Changde, from the Pacification Headquarters and the Special Service Battalion to the Tax Bureau, all participated, giving the city-building laborers unlimited excitement. All walks of life in Changde recently launched a consolation campaign for them. Within one day, they raised 1,000 catties of pork, 5,000 yuan in cash, and 5,000 theater tickets. But there are also unfair things. Zou Zhensheng, the manager of Changde Juxingcheng Bank, considers himself a privileged class and has a relationship with someone. He does not contribute people or money to this project. He was surrounded by the masses led by the Baozhang and shouted to reason with him. He wanted to rectify it. Under the difficult situation of offending the public, under the true public opinion, he lowered his head and apologized on the spot, admitting to paying for 200 laborers. It should have been published in the newspaper, but for the sake of face, it was changed to a certificate, and the masses dispersed.</p>
<p>From the West Gate through the East Gate to the North Gate, the total length of more than 4,000 meters has been restored to its original appearance. In the prominent areas, countless bunkers and machine gun emplacements have been added. Cars can travel on the city wall. This did not waste a single penny. The workers are voluntary, the bricks are donated, and the materials are recycled waste. This steel chain surrounding Changde was built in such a tense and enthusiastic way. From then on, there are bandits to defend against bandits, and water to defend against water. In an emergency, once martial law is imposed, the gangsters can be easily rounded up, and countless bunkers will become demonstration teaching aids for military and political cadres from various counties who come to Changde for training.</p>
<p>Building cities, repairing roads, and harnessing water are the most severe test of the strength of the people of Western Hunan. Commander Li Mo'an's efforts for the people have not failed. I believe that Western Hunan should progress from now on. (This newspaper reporter Ke Yiren)</p>

<p>[French News Agency, The Hague, 24th] A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhang Diao, stated that the Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue and the US delegation's declaration on the case cannot change the Dutch government's decision. Regardless of the repercussions, the Dutch government will continue its military operations against the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 25th] The Dutch side claimed on the 25th that the Netherlands will not accept the United Nations Security Council's ceasefire order because "the communists will use it." The Dutch side claimed that if a ceasefire is ordered at present, the small area between Madiun and Kediri in East Java will become a republic led by Trotskyite communist leaders. At the beginning of this week, the leader of the faction, Malarak, broadcast on Kediri Radio that he would lead the Indonesian people to resist the Netherlands and gain freedom. These Dutch people said that the communists and their sympathizers who participated in the September political riots have been released by the Republic of Indonesia and have joined the Malarak group in Central Java. They said that they are the most resistant in the current Indonesian-Dutch war. However, these people said that the Netherlands' acceptance or rejection of the ceasefire order must wait for The Hague to make a decision. They also said that officials here are waiting for The Hague's decision and cannot issue official comments on the Security Council's decision. At the same time, the Netherlands announced the release of 13 of the 17 senior officials of the Republic of Indonesia, including Dr. Darmastiwin, Hatta's personal representative.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 24th] The Dutch cabinet will hold an emergency meeting on Christmas Day to discuss the Security Council's ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] The Indonesian representative to the United States, Sumidro, said today that the Security Council's ceasefire order is meaningless unless it simultaneously stipulates that Dutch troops withdraw to their positions before the attack. This kind of order only indulges the Dutch army in carrying out its so-called mopping-up war in the occupied areas. The Security Council is so accommodating to the Netherlands that other aggressors will follow suit.</p>
<p>[United Press, Singapore, 25th] The new radio station of the Indonesian Provisional Government in Sumatra has started broadcasting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 25th] The United Nations Tripartite Mediation Committee notified the head of the Dutch delegation, Sulman, of the Security Council's ceasefire request on the morning of the 25th. A United Nations spokesman said that the official written note has been delivered to the Netherlands. He said that the Security Council's submarine telegram requesting a ceasefire from Paris was received at 8:50 am and was notified to Sulman by the US representative of the Mediation Committee, Coheren. Prior to this, the representatives of the three countries, Coheren of the United States, Krishilai of the Commonwealth of Australia, and Hermann of Belgium, held a meeting to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, New Delhi, 24th] The Indonesian representative in New Delhi, Sudasono, claimed today that India, Pakistan, and Burma have decided to actively assist the Republic of Indonesia if the Security Council's resolution and plan for the Indonesian issue cannot satisfy them. He also said that the Dutch aggression has made the Indonesian Communist Party and the Kuomintang form a united front to resist the Dutch army. The Indonesian people will never yield and will do their best to fight guerrilla warfare. Mr. Su thanked Asian countries, especially Australia, for expressing their sympathy for Indonesia with a firm attitude. It is reported that Mr. Su flew from Burma to New Delhi last night and went to see Nehru after arriving and talked for half an hour.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 24th] The Commander-in-Chief of the Republican Army in Banten Province, West Java, broadcast on the evening of the 24th that although the provincial capital of Serang in Banten Province has fallen, the Republican Army will continue to resist. According to a broadcast from the city of Mardis, there are still battles taking place in the Yogyakarta region. Dutch troops are hiding in fortresses at night and dare not go out, which indicates that guerrilla warfare may have begun. Republican General Tomok has been appointed commander of the Indonesian Suicide Squad. At the same time, the Islamic irregular army is preparing to organize guerrilla teams, and the transportation line to Surabaya has been cut off by the guerrilla teams. According to a report from the Republican Radio in Sumatra, the battle around the city of Bukittinggi, which is occupied by the Dutch, is still going on. The headquarters of Dr. Herson, the senior commissioner of the Republic of Sumatra, has moved into the mountains. The Dutch army suffered heavy casualties when attacking Bukittinggi. The Dutch army claimed that the Dutch army has occupied the city of Balok in Central Java.

<p>[French News Agency, Hanoi, 25th] Nguyen Quoc Dong, the Minister of Education and Acting Minister of Propaganda of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, announced at an important press conference on the morning of the 24th that Phan Rang and Quang Ngai provinces will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Central Government of Vietnam. However, Cam Ranh Bay, located in Quang Ngai province, will be temporarily used by France and the French Federation. Nguyen explained that this is neither a transfer of territory nor a surrender of sovereignty by Vietnam, but because Vietnam has joined the French Federation and France and Vietnam must have a common strategic area.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] The Star Evening News said on the 24th that there is a possibility of convening an emergency Imperial Conference early next year to discuss the situation in the Far East. The British Foreign Office described the situation in the Far East as "very serious and disturbing." Officials from the Commonwealth Relations Office told the Associated Press today that they knew nothing about such a conference. They did not completely deny the news, but said: "The holding of an emergency conference seems very unlikely."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 25th] British and Australian Commonwealth officials, who are directly concerned about the development of the situation in the Far East, are considering an organization similar to the Western European Union, which needs to appear in the East. Due to the seriousness of the situation in China, the Communist Party has long been eyeing Hong Kong. British officials are worried that Hong Kong will be difficult to preserve if all of China is redized. In addition, the development of Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, these worries may not be far away. British businessmen are planning how to deal with their investments in various parts of the Far East. It is estimated that the total investment is around 500 million shillings. Australia believes that the situation in the Far East has cast the most serious crisis on Britain's foreign policy, and its impact will be seen soon. However, Australia does not prevent India and Pakistan from falling into the Soviet Asian Iron Curtain, but believes that the Netherlands' actions in Indonesia will further make Indonesia lean left.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 25th] Diplomatic circles speculate that Prime Minister Gasperi may go to Washington early next year to clarify Italy's position in the Western European Union and the Atlantic Pact. These people said that Italy is trying to immediately participate in the discussions on the Western European Union, but they will not make any comments on whether they will actually participate in the alliance. They said, "The meeting between the British and Italian foreign ministers and Prime Minister Gasperi's visit to the United States are not impossible under the current circumstances." A certain authoritative diplomatic source said that Prime Minister Gasperi would not oppose visiting the United States again, as Mr. Gasperi went to the United States in January 1946 to seek economic assistance. These people also said that unofficial probes on this visit had already been launched in Washington, but it seems that this matter is still outside the official scope. Well-informed diplomatic sources said that Italy's urgent need to participate in the plan negotiations on the Western European Union was the main reason for Foreign Minister Sforza's recent meeting with French Foreign Minister Schuman. It is said that Italian Foreign Minister Sforza will go to Paris at the end of January next year to participate in the final stage of the Franco-Italian Customs Union Conference. Mr. Sforza's trip has attracted much attention here, because British Foreign Minister Bevin will also arrive in Paris at that time to attend the Western European Union Foreign Ministers' Conference, and Mr. Sforza may be able to meet with him. It is believed that this meeting will be a prelude to resolving the issue of the former Italian colonies.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 24th] The lyrics of the Christmas carolers were sung sacredly on the evening of the 24th, especially to the military and diplomatic leaders of the world. The lyrics say: "Peace on earth, goodwill to men..."</p>
<p>Those responsible for world affairs will tell everyone (1) If ever, the world has had a long period of no complete peace. (2) World War II is over, but only an armed truce. (3) In addition to the Cold War between East and West, the world map is full of sores, and human beings are killing each other.</p>
<p>In the days before Christmas, new wars broke out in Indonesia and southern Palestine. The Chinese civil war has been going on for a long time, and it is said that one-fifth of China is seeking "glorious peace" from the Chinese Communists. At international conferences, such as the recent General Assembly of the United Nations in Paris, there is little "goodwill to men." The opposing sides accuse each other of being untrustworthy and even say that they are plotting to start an atomic war. The Security Council needs to continue its meeting during the Christmas holiday to end the disputes in the Far East and the Middle East.

<p>[French News Agency Washington, 24th] It is learned that if Marshall requires a long-term rest, General Eisenhower will succeed him as Secretary of State. Marshall is scheduled to leave the hospital next week for his residence in Pinehurst, North Carolina. According to his doctors, Marshall will need to rest for several months. It is said that Marshall met with President Truman before undergoing surgery and said that he might need a long period of rest after the surgery, and he would like to recommend Eisenhower as his successor, which Truman agreed with. However, it is not yet certain whether Eisenhower will accept the appointment.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that if Eisenhower accepts the appointment, US foreign policy will not change, because Eisenhower, during his time as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces during the war, not only made decisions and issued orders, but also had to integrate the opinions of the heads of various countries, making him not only a military strategist, but also a diplomat. Eisenhower was also closely involved in the international policies of the late President Roosevelt and had mediated the disputes between Stalin and the late President. Eisenhower has always paid close attention to the position of Europe in international competition. According to those close to Eisenhower, he strongly supports the principles of the Atlantic Charter and advocates providing military lend-lease assistance to European countries if they engage in modernizing their armed forces. In his recently published book, "Crusade in Europe," Eisenhower expressed that even at this time, he still holds great optimism about the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. Although the two countries have very different systems, he hopes that they can reach a tacit understanding based on the concept of "live and let live." The idea of two vastly different lifestyles can be reconciled and formed into concrete and constructive agreements, and this optimism will never disappear.</p>

<p>— Translated by 礝石</p>
<p>In the vast area from the Soviet Union to Berlin, according to reports from American journalists, there are hidden reefs and underground activities by communists opposing Moscow.</p>
<p>The Tito regime in Yugoslavia is currently encouraging Eastern Europe to resist Moscow's orders. In Poland, pro-Moscow communists and nationalistic communists are openly confronting each other, and infighting is also occurring within the Czech Communist Party.</p>
<p>Although there are no signs of victory for communists resisting Moscow's orders in Eastern Europe, this has already made the Soviet Union feel chilled, so it is preparing to strengthen its control over Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, communist leaders, in order to show their loyalty to the Soviet Union, are devoting themselves to pleasing Moscow. Czechoslovakia and Poland are currently carrying out cleansing movements, and both countries are adopting repressive measures for all administrative matters, regardless of whether they violate public opinion.</p>
<p>Eastern Berlin is a region controlled by the Soviet Union. It has encouraged the German Communist Party to occupy the Berlin City Hall and drive out the non-communist city government. The Soviet occupation forces in Germany are constantly creating incidents, imposing land and sea blockades on West Berlin, and threatening Anglo-American airlift assistance. The Soviet Union is using such means to take over Berlin and expand its sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The communist organization is directly controlled by Moscow, which is also the Soviet Union's best weapon in the "Cold War," because many communist leaders in those countries are loyal to Moscow regardless of their own national conditions. However, there are also patriotic communists in the Eastern European countries, which has caused uneasiness for Moscow.</p>
<p>Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, and the Soviet-occupied areas of Germany and Austria are all directly controlled by Moscow. Poland and Czechoslovakia are semi-controlled by Moscow. As for Finland and Yugoslavia, they are now countries that do not rely on Moscow and do not listen to Soviet instructions.</p>
<p>The communist dictator of Yugoslavia, Tito, refuses to obey Moscow's orders, which is a major concern for the Soviet Union. In the weeks following the Tito incident, Soviet newspapers did not comment in order to elicit Tito's "confession," but Tito ultimately did not "apologize" to Moscow, so they began to criticize Tito's rebellion, while Tito and his domestic public opinion, on the contrary, condemned Moscow for undermining communist unity. At the same time, he publicly declared to the communist parties in Eastern Europe, urging them to follow the Yugoslav line. Yugoslavia's position in Eastern Europe is better than that of other countries. Only a few people in Yugoslavia support Moscow, while the majority of the Yugoslav people support Tito. The opposite is true in other Eastern European countries, because those countries are ruled by a minority of communists backed by Moscow. It is precisely for this reason that those countries cannot openly resist Moscow like Tito. However, the Tito incident has opened up a new path for the countries of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Infighting among Polish communist leaders is fierce. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka is a figure supported by the domestic masses and communist party members, and he has caused protests and bad impressions from patriotic communists by refusing Moscow's orders and "confessing" to the Soviet Union, which has also weakened the influence of the Polish Communist Party. The main goal of the Polish Communist Party's struggle is to make all Polish farmers join the collective farms run by the Communist Party. Although the Polish Communist Party leaders are so enthusiastic about following Moscow's land reform policy, unfortunately, it has not gained Moscow's favor in its diplomacy.</p>
<p>The Polish Communist Party is very worried about the revival of Germany, so it often opposes Moscow's plan to unify Germany and organize a German government. On the other hand, Poland hopes to expand its trade with the West and is also cursing the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the Marshall Plan for European aid, so the anti-Soviet front in Poland is being secretly cultivated.</p>
<p>The Czech communist government is facing even more difficulties. Prague prisons are now filled with people who participated in anti-Soviet demonstrations on the day of former President Benes' funeral. The Slavic farmers in the eastern part of the country are unwilling to support the current communist government with food. At the same time, the Czech communist government, like Poland, is opposing the Soviet Union's policy towards Germany and wants to expand trade between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
<p>In East Germany under Soviet military occupation, the communist party's efforts are considerable, but these communists, although within the Soviet sphere of influence, do not advocate that the Soviet Union transport large amounts of production materials and dismantle factories in the area to compensate for wartime destruction. As for the economic situation in East Germany, current production is below the target of its two-year recovery plan. At the same time, because the Soviet Union believes that the current East German Communist Party is not a true believer of Moscow, it is very unwilling to authorize them. As a result, the East German Communist Party is even more dissatisfied with Soviet policy.</p>
<p>Other Soviet satellite countries cannot help but rely on Moscow due to various factors such as geographical advantage and popular support. Since the Tito incident, the Albanian Communist Party, in order to show its loyalty to Moscow, has been currying favor with Moscow and publicly condemning Tito for rebelling against the Communist Information Bureau. However, Albania is harboring panic because it is adjacent to Yugoslavia and fears that Yugoslavia will invade its borders. As a result, it sought help from Moscow. The Soviet Union immediately sent a delegation of one thousand people, and the majority of them were military delegations. However, it pleased Moscow, but offended Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Moscow is very concerned about Romania and Bulgaria. Soviet texts are now mandatory subjects in the schools of these two countries. However, the communist governments of these two countries are very troubled by preventing the nationalistic movements within their countries. The Hungarian communist organization is very weak, and now it is running the government with the help of Soviet troops stationed there. Although Finland is one of the Soviet satellite countries, it is under the rule of a non-communist government. Moscow is very dissatisfied with this government, but it is supported by the masses of the people. In short, an anti-Moscow front is budding in the communist circle of Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union also knows about this crisis, so it is working to strengthen its satellite countries. (Translated from "U.S. News &amp; World Report" magazine)</p>

<h3 id="e59">New Methods for Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver; President Yu to Nanjing for Consultation; Public and Education Sector's Gold and Silver Exchange Basically Resolved <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] President Yu Hongjun of the National Bank took a train to Nanjing last night to consult with the Ministry of Finance on new methods for depositing and exchanging gold and silver, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai early next week. There are two observations here regarding the future deposit and exchange methods: (1) It is believed that the government may increase the amount of deposits when depositing and exchanging gold and silver so that its value is close to the black market, so that the situation of bank runs can be naturally eliminated; (2) In order to solve the problem once and for all, the price of gold and silver will be restored to being listed and adjusted at any time. The deposit and exchange of gold and silver will take this listed price as the standard. In other words, it is a policy of free buying and selling of gold and silver. As for the problem of gold and silver exchange for public and education personnel, after Mayor Wu negotiated with the Central Bank authorities, it has been basically resolved, that is, all public and education personnel who have been drawn and obtained permission will immediately handle the payment and exchange of gold. Starting from 4 pm yesterday, the Municipal Bank will first handle the payment of licenses numbered 1 to 7. For the remaining license numbers, the Municipal Bank will individually notify the deposit and exchange by number. As for those who have participated in the lottery but have not obtained a license, representatives from various agencies will directly negotiate with the Municipal Government to handle the matter. For those who have neither participated in the lottery nor have a license, Yu Hongjun will ask for instructions after going to Nanjing, and then decide on the handling method. In addition, the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau is extremely concerned about the public and education sector's gold and silver exchange, and sent representatives to the Municipal Government yesterday to inquire about the situation.

<h3 id="e73">Situation Bleak on Christmas Eve; Low Turnout at Labor Comfort Dance <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The all-night labor comfort dance organized by the city's comfort association at various dance halls had its first night on Christmas Eve. Due to the curfew, the number of dancers was not as high as expected. According to the statistics group of the association, the number of tickets sold the previous night was 600+ at Paramount, 600+ at Ciro's, 200+ at New Ciro's, 200+ at Cosmopolitan, 111 at MGM, and 107 at Grand Shanghai. Smaller dance halls earned even less, such as New Dahua, which only sold 10+ tickets. In total, the amount raised was far from the association's goal of raising 1 million yuan per night. After 11 pm the previous night, Lido had to stop playing because the band temporarily requested a subsidy that was not granted, and the dancers all transferred to the Cosmopolitan. Business at various dance halls improved last night, but many dancers still evaded purchasing tickets. The comfort association sent personnel to randomly check and persuade them to purchase tickets. According to the person in charge of the comfort association, the purpose of holding the all-night dance is to raise funds for comforting the military and police who maintain the city's security on New Year's Day. The association has taken into account the business of the dance halls and has agreed in advance to allocate 50% of the ticket revenue to cover the dance halls' expenses. Therefore, it is hoped that dancers, dance halls, and the police and military who assist in maintaining order will fully cooperate with the association to achieve complete success.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Male Corpse Found While Fishing, Murder Case in East Shanghai Solved, Two Criminals Caught, Confessed to Revenge Killing <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] At around 12:00 noon on the 20th, an unidentified male corpse was found in the Xijiazhai River in Ma Yushan Road, East Shanghai. A fisherman accidentally caught the corpse and reported it to the Xinshi Street Police Branch Bureau. Branch Director Wang Zhaoxin rushed to the scene for inspection. A national identity card was found on the deceased, identifying him as Zhu Asan, 18 years old, from Qidong. After returning to the bureau, Liu, the section chief, was instructed to deploy intelligence. At the same time, staff members Su Yongqing, along with criminal police officers Shi Chenghou, Qu Nairong, and Xu Daquan, were dispatched to investigate and apprehend the suspects. It was learned that many Qidong natives lived around Shanghai University of Science and Technology on Jungong Road, so investigations were started there. By dusk, it was learned that the deceased's foster father, Niu Xiqi (45 years old, from Haimen), worked as a school worker at Shanghai University of Science and Technology. The investigating police officers rushed to arrest him overnight and asked him about the whereabouts of the victim. According to Niu: "I am a cook at Shanghai University. On the 21st, Zhu Asan came to my house from Baoshan. Because the room was small and there were too many people, I could not accommodate him. I accompanied him to the school to meet a fellow townsman, Zhu Zhongyi. At that time, Zhongyi was having dinner in the dining hall. I handed Asan over to him, and then I left. The next day at noon, I went to Zhongyi's place to call Asan for dinner, but Zhongyi said he had left. It was not until the 23rd that people in the school read the newspaper and learned that Asan had been murdered." After the investigating police officers obtained this confession, they arrested Zhu Zhongyi at Shanghai University of Science and Technology at 2:00 PM on the same afternoon and brought him in for questioning. Zhu confessed: Zhu Asan had joined the New Fourth Army in his hometown of Qidong. My younger brother, Zhu Zhongxin, died at his hands. My father was kidnapped, but fortunately escaped. All the family's property was confiscated by him. There was also a fellow townsman named Qian Bujian, a carpenter, who was also harmed in the countryside. His family was destroyed, and he was all alone. He currently lives at No. 64, Jia 12, Bao 14, Xinxishi District, Yinxiang Port. After learning that Zhu Asan was staying at my house, I discussed with Qian how to get revenge. We agreed to kill him. That night (i.e., the 21st), after discussing it, we invited Asan, falsely claiming to go back to Qian Bujian's door, and called Qian out to go to see a play together. When we reached about half a li southwest of Shanghai University of Science and Technology (i.e., the above-mentioned location, which is unusually remote), there was no one around. I grabbed Asan's hands, and Qian took out a carpenter's square and stabbed Asan in the forehead. He stabbed him four more times in the neck. Asan fell to the ground and died on the spot. We threw the body into the river and went back to school to sleep. Killing Zhu Asan was purely revenge." He also confessed the whereabouts of the accomplice Qian Bujian. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Qian was captured in a shantytown in Yinxiang Port and brought to the bureau for separate interrogation. However, Qian was extremely cunning and flatly denied helping to commit the murder. After the main culprit confronted him and identified him, he lowered his head and said nothing, admitting everything without hesitation. The branch bureau plans to apply for an extension of detention for the two criminals for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously, due to the promulgated "Supplementary Measures for Fiscal Reorganization," concerning the revision of fee collection standards, stipulated that the threshold for business profit income tax was 150 gold yuan, and the threshold for salary and remuneration income tax was 40 yuan per month. Both were based on the real value of the newly issued gold yuan at the time. Now that the gold yuan's value has depreciated fivefold, these thresholds should naturally be appropriately raised. After sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry replied stating that an adjustment plan for the threshold and tax brackets for fixed salary income tax had already been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, an order would be issued for implementation. As for the levy of business profit income tax for the second half of this year, it will be based on the net profit earned by businesses in the first half of the year. The original supplementary measures were determined based on the economic situation in the first half of the year and are not related to current prices. The request for adjustment should not be discussed, according to the Ministry.</p>

However, due to continued large deposits from national banks, rates fell back to the range of 12 to 15 yuan. Black market prices for gold and silver were similar to the previous day. However, rice prices continued to rise sharply. The highest price on the Shangbai Market was 560 yuan, and retail prices even exceeded 600 yuan.</p>

<p>Rice prices continued to rise sharply yesterday. Considering general commodity prices, the increase in rice prices was relatively small, and suppliers strongly resisted price drops. The morning market was extremely tight, and no one was willing to offer samples for a time. Later, trading gradually resumed, and prices rose sharply.

<h3 id="e104">Manufacturers Exporting Industrial Products Can Use Export Foreign Exchange <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources, after the promulgation and implementation of the new measures for managing import and export trade, the "Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Exported Products" and the "Measures for Permitting Special Imports of Packaging Materials Needed by Exporters for Shipping Export Goods" formulated and implemented by the Export Control Committee prior to its reorganization are still valid. According to these two sets of measures, manufacturers who export industrial products, such as rubber, thermoses, straw hats, and enamelware, may use a portion of their earned export foreign exchange to import their manufacturing raw materials. In addition, exporters of agricultural, industrial, and animal products are also allowed to apply for the import of foreign packaging materials actually needed using a portion of their earned export foreign exchange. The intention is to enable manufacturers who export industrial products to directly order raw materials and packaging materials from abroad using their own export foreign exchange. This import is not subject to the qualification of being a registered importer, nor is it subject to quota allocation restrictions, which greatly assists manufacturers who operate export sales of industrial products. It is reported that the committee's past performance has been very good and can greatly supplement the newly promulgated import and export trade measures to achieve the effect of implementing commodity chain and promoting exports.</p>

<p>Cotton yarn rose sharply and fell slightly. Most buyers turned to watching, and holders, wary of high prices, sold off at highs. Popular grades were also unable to open higher, and the market weakened slightly.</p>
<p>42-count Lanfeng rose from 27,000 yuan to a high of 27,500 yuan, then closed at a low of 26,900 yuan, down 2,100 yuan from the previous day. The remaining Baoguang and Tiannv, etc., all declined slightly by 1,300 to 2,000 yuan. 40-count Lanfeng fell slightly by 1,500 yuan, closing at 23,200 yuan. 32-count Yinyue retreated slightly by 800 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Shuangma spot goods approached the 20,000 yuan level, opening at 19,500 yuan, a low of 19,100 yuan, noon closing at 19,400 yuan, finally down 800 yuan. Warehouse receipt fell 700 yuan to 18,400 yuan. 20-count Shuangma fell sharply by 500 yuan, Jinji and Tiannv all fell slightly by about 300 yuan, and Yida count also showed slight weakness. Except for Tongzijun, which rose by 200 yuan, 10-count yarn showed a weak state.</p>
<p>The cloth market was initially weak but then continued firm. Opening trade was uneventful. Small households retreated one after another. With demand for cheaper products still present, the market saw a better outlook.</p>
<p>Longtou fine cloth opened at 680 yuan, with prices raising to 715 yuan, before closing at 710, an increase of 5 yuan. Sijunzi yuan bi ji opened at 680, reached 700, and then closed at 690, remaining even with the day before. Jin Lian Miao Wu yuan bi ji also showed no gain or loss. Tiao Li Yuan bi ji fell by 40 yuan. Sijunzi yuan zhigong rose by 10 yuan, closing at 700 yuan. Private factories in and around Shanghai still sold at a value of 600. 190 was priced at 1300. Direct sales, while narrow, remained solid.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper Zi Jian</p>
<p>[Airmail report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 23rd] Before Santa Claus in red robes and white hair delivered his gifts to the people of Hong Kong this year, as if he had visited other cities in the past two or three years, he first brought a terrible disaster: a "Sky Master" at about 2 p.m. on the 21st, at a low altitude in Baiershen, more than ten miles northeast of Hong Kong, collided with the top of Huoshiniao Mountain, immediately destroying thirty-three lives. The danger of flying in fog has added another layer of shadow to people's minds.</p>
<p>"Sky Master" Victims – Half Burned to Death, Half Fell to Their Deaths</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses returning from the disaster scene: the crashed "Sky Master" was broken in two, the upper half resting on the top of the mountain and already burned down. The lower half fell into a mountain pit, irreparably damaged. It seems that some of the victims must have died from falling rather than burning. A person close to the aviation industry said: Kai Tak Airport, because the visibility over Hong Kong had been obscured by dense fog, had telegraphed the Sky Master to divert to Guangzhou to land, but for some reason, it crashed into the mountain through the cloud gap and was shattered to pieces.</p>
<p>According to the company: Three "Sky Master" aircraft flew out of Shanghai at the same time on the morning, the other two landed safely in Hong Kong, good luck and misfortune are separated by a hair's breadth!</p>

<p>Today, in front of the Hong Kong office of China National Aviation Corporation, people came and went, especially crowded. Turning a corner, we also found a pile of people, but the former were people inquiring about the plane crash, and the latter were audiences waiting to buy tickets to listen to Ma Lianliang sing. "Shanghai customers" also accounted for the majority of spectators in this tragedy and a comedy. At about the same time, the Li Li Opera Troupe and the Ma Lianliang Opera Troupe performed in two major theaters in central Hong Kong, respectively. This was the first Peking opera performance after the war. There were also many people who did not understand Mandarin but went to admire the name. In the past half month, the performances on the "political stage" in Hong Kong have also been quite lively, and Long Yun's arrival in Hong Kong has pushed this play to a climax.</p>
<h3 id="e110">This Year's Christmas Gifts are Cheap – The Market is Colder <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>At the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula on the opposite side of Hong Kong, there is another very lively scene. The first Hong Kong "National Goods" exhibition after the war is being held on the open space on the side of the Peninsula Hotel. In this exhibition, people can see the production side of some Shanghai-escaped funds setting up factories in Hong Kong. Despite the big fanfare of the National Goods Exhibition, most of the goods in the major companies in the Christmas market are Japanese goods, which is simply a great irony! "This year's Christmas gifts are cheaper than last year," Hong Kong people say in unison, but this year's market is colder than last year, which shows that Hong Kong cannot prosper without a solution to China's economy.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper, Lanzhou, 25th] Before the industrial loan was opened, the loan application procedures for various production institutions in Gansu Province were ready, with a total amount of 20 million yuan, including 5 million yuan each for coal mines, machine factories, and cement companies, 3 million yuan for chemical factories, and 2 million yuan for leather factories. In addition, the production of various institutions has shrunk, and funds are insufficient, and they are considering reducing staff.</p>

<p>The University has Transferred Request to the Ministry of Education for a Decision</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Xi'an, 25th] There are new changes in the relocation of three universities, including Xida, to the south. Internal opinions in each school are divided. Since the relocation decision, professors, staff, and students of northern origin have unanimously opposed the relocation to the south and confronted those who advocate the relocation to the south. They have recently repeatedly petitioned, and the university has transferred this opinion to the Ministry of Education for a decision. Xi'an University has been on winter vacation since the 23rd, and the semester exams of Xi'an University and Xi'an Institute of Technology are in progress.</p>

<p>(3) Upon investigation, it was found that according to regulations, all goods stored in warehouses should be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau by filling out a material registration form. However, the said company prepared an inventory list in English on September 25th and directly submitted it to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisory Office. This office should have immediately recognized the procedural error and ordered the company to submit it to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and instructed them to prepare a registration form in Chinese. Instead of doing so, they accepted it and treated it as a legal registration, which cannot be excused from suspicion of showing favoritism. Furthermore, after the case occurred on September 29th, it caused a national sensation. The office failed to take timely and active measures as it would have in other cases, and only handed it over to the police bureau to handle the case according to law and report back. This naturally failed to convince the public and had a significant impact on the work under its management at the time. It wasn't until November 6th, when economic controls were about to be abolished, that without waiting for the Shanghai Police Bureau to report back on the handling of the case, it took emergency measures to require the company's industrial raw materials and daily necessities to be supplied to the market at limited prices. Although this does not fail to be a remedial measure showing a sense of responsibility, it is still regrettable in that it failed to seize the opportunity to handle the matter completely. However, since the office was neither an executive agency nor under orders to conclude, the responsible personnel are temporarily excused from discussion.</p>
<p>(4) Upon investigation, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance estimated that the Yangtze Construction Company's income and profit taxes for the 36th year (of the Republic, i.e. 1947) were over 177 million yuan, which was less than one-thousandth of one percent of the amount it should have paid. No wonder the national treasury's tax revenue is decreasing daily, the burden on the common people is increasing daily, and the rich are becoming richer by the day. Further investigation reveals that according to Article 2 of the Measures for the Collection of Business Income Tax in the 37th Year (1948), Article 21 of the Income Tax Law, and the provisions of Article 31, in addition to paying the estimated income and profit taxes, the company should have determined the amount and paid it off as soon as possible. However, as of October 17th, when Huang Zupei, the Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, personally handed over the company's tax payment forms for the 36th and 37th years, there was only the estimated amount for the 37th year, and no income or profit tax for the 37th year. Furthermore, there was no record of the company's payment of the determined amount. With the value of currency falling daily, the delay in tax collection for more than half a year has caused significant damage to the national treasury. Furthermore, the special business tax rate stipulates that companies with profit income should be taxed at 1.5% of their turnover. The exact amount of the company's turnover in the first half of the year has not been investigated and reported. However, based on the 137 yuan and 47 fen in gold yuan that it paid for special business tax in the first half of the 37th year, its total turnover was only over 9,000 gold yuan. For such a large company, based on its inventory, its turnover in the first half of the year, converted into gold yuan, should be at least over one million yuan. Its income tax is actually less than one percent of that. In short, the huge amount of tax evaded by the company is a huge loss to the state, and it is also a huge piece of evidence of favoritism and illegal conduct by the personnel in charge of tax collection. The responsible personnel of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance are indeed guilty of illegal and derelict behavior and should be punished with the punishment they deserve.</p>
<p>(5) Upon investigation, since the 36th year (1947), the Import and Export Management Committee has issued more than 400 automobile import permits to Yangtze Construction and Li Han companies. The majority of these were for vehicles seating seven or fewer people, priced at more than US$1,200 or its equivalent in other currencies (Chevrolet, Fiat, and four-door Austin cars all cost around US$4,000 in Shanghai, and their factory prices in the United States must be above US$1,200, it can be asserted. Moreover, Kong Xiangxi and his son Kong Lingkan owned many Cadillac cars of Li Han in 1948, whose market price was no less than US$7,000 to 8,000 each). All of these were prohibited from import by Appendix (4) of the Import and Export Trade Regulations announced on November 17th of the 35th year (1946). It is incomprehensible why the committee issued permits. In recent years, luxurious new cars have flooded major cities, consuming large amounts of foreign exchange, which is hated by society. Based on the examples of Yangtze Construction and Li Han companies, the Import and Export Management Committee should bear the majority of the responsibility, and it should be investigated to rectify the situation and maintain law and order.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding Kong Xiangxi and Kong Lingkan's 1948 Cadillac cars, and another batch of more than six Fiat cars of Yangtze Construction Company, the Import and Export Management Committee claimed that it had not issued import permits. Why did the Jianghai Customs allow them to be imported? Even if the company and Kong evaded taxes through smuggling, how could these bulky cars have landed without collusion with the responsible personnel of the Jianghai Customs? Whether the company also colluded with the responsible personnel of the Jianghai Customs when using forged tax bills to smuggle goods should also be investigated to clarify responsibilities.</p>
<p>In summary, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Police Chief Yu Shuping, Captain of the Economic Police Corps Cheng Yikuan, Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance Huang Zupei, Chairman of the Import and Export Management Committee Huo Baoshu, and Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs Zhang Yongnian (or the responsible personnel in charge during their respective tenures when the misconduct occurred) should all be impeached and transferred to the Executive Yuan to investigate their responsibilities and impose appropriate punishments to rectify official conduct and maintain law and order.
