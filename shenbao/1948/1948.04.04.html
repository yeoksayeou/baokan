<h3>社論　新中國幼苗的培養</h3>
<p>—兒童節期望於國民學校教師與父母者—</p>
<p>今日是第十七屆兒童節，是我們全國兒童共同愛好的隹節。在這春光明媚的時候，本市與全國各地均有各種紀念慶祝的活動。我們可以想像：在今天，有無數天眞活潑的兒童，在興奮歡躍，也有許多辛勤的老師們，在其神聖的任務中感受安慰，更有許多劬勞的父母，在生活重荷中面對繼起的第二代，寄以無窮的期望。在我們整個國家中，如果舊的枝葉正受着風霜無情的剝磨，那無數欣欣向榮的兒童，正代表新中國的幼芽幼苗在茁壯，在生長。從兒童少年的精進不息上，我們欣然看出國家民族光明的前程。</p>
<p>基於這個理由，我們今天要對全國童年同胞　　　的祝視，更要向養育培護這無數幼苗的老師與其父母們深致敬意和慰勞。處在生活高漲的今日，子女生活是每個家長的重荷；一般依新給爲生的公務敎育人員，和工農同胞一樣感到敎養子女成長爲非易事。至於國民學校的敎師，一面勤勞於教導他人的子女，一面勉力擔負自己子女衣食求學的費用，還時有失學乃至凍餒之處，更其値得我們的同情。國家未來的基礎在乎兒童，所以我們切望政府今後要多多注重國民基本敎育，改良小學敎師待遇，推進兒童福利工作，切實保護童工，並且要逐步樹立對於子女衆多的公敎員工，特予補助敎養的社會立法與制度。</p>
<p>怎樣切實培護我們新中國的幼苗，使其健全發育和成長，我們的希望當然更多寄與終年勞瘁敎導兒童的敎師們，和忍苦負重保養他們子女的父母們。他們才是我們國家託付以這一份艱鉅負荷的園丁。不過我國一向忽略兒童身心的發展，直至現在克盡父母敎養之道的，究竟還是很少；而隨着小學敎育的普及與進步，我們都知道和兒童生活接觸最密，最能影響而且領導他們的，還是他們的老師。所以我們在此兒童節日，特別期望國民學校敎師要善盡其培護中國未來主人的喜任。</p>
<p>中國的國民敎育，在近十年中確有不少的進步。在制度上，我們在戰時制定了國民學校法，與縣自治實施相輔進；在方法上更多試驗研究與改良的成績。可異的是近來，我們看到敎師的轉業改業，在國民學校爲尤多，鄕村小學的敎師，尤多因此由不合格的人來接任。一方面，我們又常聽到他們爲生活歎息和怨望的呼聲。由於這種煩懣和不平，因而减低兒童敎育的效率，實在不可計量，我們自然要求國民敎師待遇的提高；同時我們更願向敎師們進一言：敎育工作誠然勞苦，可是替國家培育未來的主人，而且能領受人世間最純潔的赤子的愛敬，其任務是神聖的，精神是愉快的。培護新中國幼苗的工作最是不朽。願諸君勿自菲薄，自能受社會的尊敬。至於爲父母家長的人，也必須多多注意於兒童身心的健康，使家庭保有善良的風氣，以輔助學校敎育促進新中國幼苗的滋榮。</p>
<p>關於當前兒童敎育應該改進的理論和實際，國民學校的敎師素來經心講求，無庸我們多贅。只是在當前社會不景氣現象之下，我們希望培育兒童的敎師們特予注意力行的，有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，多作光明提示。今日世局與國事的動亂，影響人心的沉悶，破壞性的宣傳和陰謀乖隙而入，多數青年幾被陷入迷惘的境界，對國家社會都失却信心。這稱不健全的心理，萬不可讓其沾及兒童，這是小學敎師一種嚴肅的責任。我們認爲純潔的幼小的心靈是常向着光明的，只要他們敬仰的老師能勿太强調社會的陰暗面，勿對天眞的孩童發表主觀的牢騷，並且常常正面的提示對國家前途的信心，我們相信其安定社會轉移風氣的效果是極大的。</p>
<p>其次，我們以爲今後兒童敎育須着重意志的訓練：近年國民敎育中的理論與方法，對于引起「動機」培養「興趣「等最所注意，敎品屬行之敎在小學裏也保持不少，可是我們當覺得今日靑年最缺乏的還是意志力，這就得在兒童階段培其基礎。有如吃苦耐勞的習慣，硬幹期成的精神，持久的恒心和毅力，都是在中國社會中要自立立人所特別需要的。敎師當多多提示自力更生的故事，證明人定勝天的至理。</p>
<p>第三，致力身敎的示範：在知慧未啓的兒童羣中，我們當然要多多講解設譬和化導，但身敎之效，在小學裏最易生效，因爲兒童是眞率而富于模仿性的。如禮節，整潔，守法，動儉等德性，與其反覆可囑，不如身踐力行以身作則，更爲有效。敎師能愛公物，負責任，即是培植兒童公德與責任心最有力的示範；學校與家庭裏保有眞切的同情心，是社會信義與互助的出發點。在今日社會道德失望之中，小學敎師的轉念善惡，關係社會風氣與國家前途眞是太偉大了。</p>
<p>此外，對于養育兒童的父母們，他們之犧牲個人勞力與幸福以畫力于子女的扶養和敎育，其使命也一樣是神聖的。不過我們希望他們勿斤斤以掙錢謀生活來責望他們的縱承人，而也應從國家前途着想，要多多啓示子女幼輩以人性的光明國，注意鍜鍊其意志以輔助其知能的增長，尤其勿忽略自身言動的示範作用，這樣才能輔助敎師，收到更大敎育的效果。</p>
<p>最後，在戡亂軍事未已的今日，我們深切關懷戰區流亡失學失依的兒童們；這遭受無情摧殘的幼苗，其數量已相當龐大，其等待救濟是迫切的。我們願呼籲社會有錢者慷慨捐轍于這方面的救濟，我們更切望政府于正軌國民敎育之外，能盡力來策劃難童的收容與敎育。兒意是父母與國家所共有的，所以政府在戡亂期間，也須負起這個保護幼苗的責任。</p>
<h3>張君勱由日抵滬　謂世界大戰一兩年不致再發生　論及美援認須自己爭氣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨主席張君勱，昨日午後一時四十分已自東京搭西北公司班機抵滬。張氏與記者談及美援時，認爲只須自己爭氣，不怕人家不帮忙，否則即有外援，亦無濟於事。將來美國主持援華之人選爲誰，因貸款之用途已有規定，故並不重要。以一般世界局勢而論，大戰雖不致於一兩年內再度發生，但美蘇關係已非常緊張，美國朝野備戰之情緒均甚高。關於我國目前局勢，張氏認爲已甚危急，必須在政治。軍事文化多方面努力，使「能像一個國家」。並謂：「目前努力之途徑，首先爲恢復和平，第二爲提高人民生活及樹立廉潔之政治。恢復和平並非恢復和談之謂，而爲田各方而覺悟而獲致和平，戰有戰的辦法，和有和的辦法」。記者詢以是否有意競選副總統，張氏表示：「本人對於此事，並未加考慮，至於支持那位副總統候選人，須與黨內洽商後方能有決定，原則爲希望向朝氣及振作方向走」。按張氏於去年十二月十三日出國，先至華府，今年一月至西雅圖華盛頓大學講學，三月份至波十頓紐約及華府，在美京曾訪晤馬歇爾。魏德邁等有關人士。</p>

<h3>含山國大代表　過效六遇刺之謎</h3>
<p>〔本報合肥一日快訊〕在國大開始報到的前三天，當春雨纏綿天空烏黑的夜晚，含山國大代表過效六遇刺殞命了！截至現在，兇手尙未拿獲，案情仍然是謎，合山縣政府正懸賞兩千萬緝兇，探求一個水落石出的眞相。</p>
<p>家無恒產　儉樸成性</p>
<p>過效六是含山運漕鎭人家無恒產，儉樸成性。早年畢業省立一師後，便踏入社會服務，生活逼得他必須自力更生。隨着逝水般的年華，他在社會上的地位便日漸崇高，他幹了一連串的工作，成爲縣黨部委員，縣府科員科長，浙省府政工隊長，浙專保公署科長，在地方上複雜的人事關係中，有形無形地成爲部份的領導者，勝利後一躍而爲省參議員，去年參加國大競選，又獲得了最多數選　的擁獲，自然，這正是他紅得發紫的時候了。</p>
<p>環境雖惡　知難不退</p>
<p>地位優越的結果，地方上大小事情，自然的從他手中經過，這中間，就有許多微妙問題發生，對於他，感激涕零的有人，不共戴天的也就不免。去年，他出席省參會三次大會時，由於一個偶然的機會，他和記者談着含山情形，最後嘆息着說：「渦問地方事情，誠然太難，但我決不肯知難而退。」他又說：環境雖不單純，但一退下便什麼都完了，幹下去總不致有殺身之禍，他深信在地方上的惡勢力並沒有惡劣到這般程度。從他短小的身材與樸實無華的外表看，眞不相信他是如此有魄力有勇氣的人物，他頑强地工作着，一直到這次的遇害。</p>
<p>半夜槍聲　橫禍飛來</p>
<p>他的自信心實在强！在行動上，他從不提防會有人暗殺他，夜晚照常獨自出外回家，家裏門戶隨便出入，生活方式和一般人無異。他幾乎沒有想渦會有遇害的事，雖然曾有朋友勸吿渦他行動不可太隨便。終於這可怕一幕降到他身上了，是三月十五日的深夜，在含山南門大街張姓房屋第二進左邊的一間房內，和平時的情形一樣，集攏着不少客人談天（一說是在雀戰），主人就是過效六。風雨齊來，但誰也不知道今天夜晚會有一人死於一擊之下。時間已是十一點多鐘了，賓主興猶未蘭，過效六由房內步出堂門只聞砰的一聲，他　聲倒地了。</p>
<p>勤務折返　兇手逃逸</p>
<p>他的勤務何承恩趕出，在天色昏暗中，看見一個藍色長衣頭戴禮帽的漢子，急向前門奔跑，追至大門口，又見有三個人影，何承恩跟踪尾追，那三個人折入縣中宿舍巷內，這勤務忽然想起自己手無寸鐵，窮追下去，徒然使自己吃虧，便返回住所。這時的過效六，已在埀危中，因爲槍彈由臀部射入，腹部而出，危殆萬分。客人們忙着延請醫生診治，終於次日上午八時不治身死，這一位含山的風雲人物，便如此完結了，享年僅四十三歲。</p>
<p>捕獲疑犯　嚴鞫詳審</p>
<p>事發，警察局出動搜補兇手，就在那個縣中宿舍巷後附近王家巷住戶唐文基家中，捕得重大嫌疑犯羅品一，凌昌如，算耀東三人。迄目前止，尙找不出一點兇手證據來。十七日又捕得一名凌國英者，在目前，這批人都還是嫌疑犯。含山縣府一面懸賞緝兇，一面嚴鞫詳審，查案正在發展中。</p>
<p>渦效六之死，迄今已歷半月，對於他的死因，據記者探悉，有兩說；一說他生前在含山太走紅，享盡風光，招來忌怨所致。另說還是爲了競選國代，才遭此暗算。目前還不敢下斷語　。待到正兇緝獲之日，該就是本案水落石出之時。（本報記者　白萍）</p>

<h3>盟國對日和約未簽訂前　日將恢復行政自由　對日頒發指令制度可能逐漸消除　凱甯報告贊揚麥帥政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京三日電〕中央社記者自東京若千消息靈通方面人士獲悉，日本政府不久可能開始恢復行政方面之自由。盟國管制日本頒發指令之制度，因此或將逐漸消除。根據此種計劃，日本政府在若干方面，將可重獲全部自由以決定政策及行動。迄今管制行政事務之盟國各軍政府部門，即將因此取消，獨立行動之範圍將逐漸擴大，以至日本政府終而對一切尋常行政恢復整個管制，以及日本政府本實上恢復爲一完全主權國家。就此方面言，麥帥本年一月十八日致函國會衆院撥款委會要求「允許日本在解決其本身內政問題及保衛其本身福利方面，大體而言可重獲行動自由」逐步取消指令制度，在義大利業已執行。一般認爲，在麥帥離日赴美後，日本方面若干政府純粹內政平時工作，可能開始逐漸不再受盟國之管制。迄今麥帥猶未表示不久渠將返美，但一般跡象說明渠將於下月中旬離日。政府組之其他官員，聞亦擬離日返國，政府組已令日本中央整肅委會準備結束工作，此點殊具意義。日議會調查非法處置政府財產之委會（按此爲在盟國佔領下所成立之最有力量之政治委員會之一）已奉命於四月廿日完成其調查工作。聞對日本報紙之檢查，亦將於本月底取消。諸此發展，設明目前已完成若千準備，藉使日本政治之若干方面，不再受盟國之管制，取消指令制度，或將非爲盟國將放棄監督日本發展少一切管制努力，然此將爲趨向於日本在和約未簽訂前，重獲其國家主權之首一具體步驟。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日合衆電〕據消息靈通人士稱：甫自遠東視察歸來之馬歇爾高級擘劃政策人士凱寧，刻已將其報吿送呈馬氏，其中對麥帥管轄日本之政策，深致贊譽，且對麥帥所擬定美對日本米來政治經濟政策，亦力表贊同。消息靈通人士稱：凱寧此行主要乃圖親覩遠東之情形，蓋渠尙從未至此地區也。渠送呈馬氏之報吿中，雖述渠認爲美在遠東所應採取之政策，而將予馬氏以相當之影響。凱氏表示堅決同意麥帥意見，即如盟國對召開對日和會之程序問題，不能獲致同意，則美必須採取單獨行動，建立日本經濟使達於自足之程度，且可抗禦共黨之滲入，凱氏幷同意際此美蘇在全球關係普遍惡化之時，應考慮日本可作防共堡壘之軍事價値，凱寧在與美陸次屆拉普所領導之遠東經濟代表團團員作簡短之會談後，亦同意渠等之意見，此即應即停止日本此後之賠償，而應以更大之努力，提高日本工業水準。至日本工業，究應發展至何程度一問題，凱寗美陸軍部極端份子如屈拉普　是否意見一致，則尙無所悉。據悉，凱寗對取消對日一切管制問題，主張採較審愼態度。消息靈通人士指出，屈拉普所率代表團，係以商人身份發表對此問題之意見，凱寗則爲全盤計劃之　劃者，故渠不得不持審愼態度，以策安全。</p>
<h3>蘇宣布退出盟管六委會　柏林形勢仍緊張　蘇新措施含有示威性質</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕蘇聯於施行加緊統制蘇聯區與西方區之交通後未滿四十八小時，即又宣布蘇聯今後將不參加柏林四强聯合總部所屬之交通，公共福利，財產管制，肅淸納粹文化及經濟等六個委員會。蘇聯此一決議，係於四强副司令在柏林之會議席上宣佈。西方三代表當抗議蘇聯此一意向，認爲此六委曾乃柏林四强總總完整的一部，不能予以取消。蘇代表答以蘇聯方面人員不敷分配，當不參加此等委員會。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林二日電〕西方盟國與蘇聯在柏林之緊張關係，已因下列若干新發展而愈形嚴重：（一）蘇聯之宣布不再參加柏林四强聯合總司令部之六個委員會，（二）過去廿四小時中蘇方在各邊區之增兵。同時英總司令羅勃森美總司令克萊及法總司令寇尼許已再度聲明，三强決不退出柏林。德社民黨領袖許馬赫：向德人發表談話，表示相信西方盟國決不退出柏林，非爲愛護德人，實亦爲其本身之聲譽計。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕德境英軍副司令勃朗瓊少將談稱，余相信蘇聯之統制交通規則，在迫使西方盟國在柏林之地位無法維持，亦所以向德人民表示蘇聯具有較西方國家更强大的權力，然西方盟國亦決不願示弱。吾人認爲蘇聯之擇定於此時採取此等示威性的行動，與義大利之選舉亦有關係。勃氏繼謂，國外報紙對此事宣傳過甚，使人以爲諸强在德已作戰爭準備，其實蘇方之新規則不過需要由往來旅客出示派司，並無阻止持有派司之旅客通過之意。</p>
<h3>柏林美憲兵封鎖　蘇鐵路總局　貨運仍暢通無阻</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林三日電〕美軍司令部今日宣布，已於昨夜派兵五十名，將柏林美佔區內蘇聯鐵路管理局暫時封鎖，蘇聯籍辦事人員廿二名今晨九時到處辦公，因之不得入內。封鎖期內由美軍官一名率領士兵六名及德警察爾名駐守，檢宣所有行人及車輛。觀察家構，此乃對蘇車當局下令檢查進出柏林車輛之報復行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕英美均於今日以不載任何搭客之火車，載運相林英美人所需之糧食等供應物開來柏林。美軍火車一列計五十二節，奉克萊將軍之令，載糧食汽油及其他供應物品共五百廿九噸自勃隆斯維克駛柏林，已經過馬林蓬之蘇軍邊界檢查站。英軍供應車一列亦可望於三日抵達柏林。軍政府發言人謂，英當局並無以飛機載運糧食接濟柏林之計劃，英當局並證實西方佔領區與柏林間之鐵路貨運暢通如恒，此間美人方面所傳柏林英美人將實施計口配糧之說尙不能證一實。</p>
<h3>蒙帥抵德境　定週二赴柏林</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林三日電〕英參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥，可望於三日抵德境英軍區，與英軍總司令羅勃森晤談。兩人雖將談及柏林之緊張局勢，然英官方特聲明此非榮帥訪德之宗旨，　帥預定於週二赴柏林。</p>
<h3>羅雅爾表示　美軍決留駐柏林</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕美陸長羅雅爾本日稱，蘇聯最近雖採取行動，截斷柏林與西歐間之交通，然美國之軍隊仍將留駐柏林·羅氏於記者招待會中稱，陸軍部完全支持德境美軍司令克萊將軍之無敵意而堅定之政策。同時代理國務卿洛維特稱，英美法三國代表將於下週內再度會晤，以討論西德問題。洛氏並指出蘇大使潘友新本日僅與渠討論美國拘留蘇船事。</p>
<h3>美援歐援華統一法案　總統簽署即生效　並將設立臨時機構加以管理</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕六十億零九千八百萬元援歡援華防共法案今午可由杜魯門總統簽署，較預定時限早兩星期·總統並將同時下令設立臨時機關管理最初三十日援歐法案執行事宜，此後則當由援歐復興專署接辦。據國務部次長洛維特昨日宣布，國務部已將專署組織大致部署元成，星期一即可開始辦公。</p>
<p>署長人選則當由杜魯門任命，然後由參院批准。其官職爲部長級，人選以史蒂培克汽車公司總經理霍夫曼呼聲最高。此外杜魯門總統並當指定現任大使一名，赴各國監察援助事宜實施情形，外交界方面推測其人選當屬駐英大使陶格拉斯。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕國會通過之統盤援外法案後，撥款雖尙須經衆院撥款委員會通過，然法案內規定准許復興銀團於總統簽准該法案後，立即對歐洲復興方案墊付十億元，對援華援土援希案，各立即墊付五千萬元，以便物資之即時啓運。代理國務卿洛維特二日晚宣布歐洲復興方案下之物資於下星期一即可開始啓運。</p>

<p>蘇聯要求該案規定關於譴責法西斯主義之修正案，被否決。英國要求刪去該案內譴責獨佔之部份，則被通過，阿根廷要求大會邀西班牙派觀察員列席之案亦被否決。大會技術委員會，通過荷蘭所提禁止對報紙電台及影片從事事先檢查之案；並通過英國之四決議案：（一）合法進入國內之外國記者，不得因其合法行使採訪及輸入新聞之權而予驅逐；（二）政府對新聞機構供給資料時，不得因政治，國籍，宗敎，種族，或個人而有歧視；（三）政府應調查國內新聞機構之被公私獨佔狀况；（四）人人得有不受壓迫置備無綫電機收取國內外一切波長廣播之權</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍　論美國對華政策</h3>
<p>克里浦斯翟華特系報業聯合會版權所有</p>
<p>本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>（八）缺乏廣大深刻眼光</p>
<p>中國在美國聰明與友好的帮助之下，縱使在我們正和她並肩對日作戰的時候，也可能踏上戰後堅強穩定和自行改進之路。</p>
<p>但是，這個機會在疏忽和拙笨的手指之間溜走了。世界軍略重心的亞洲之一半，最後變成了地位和勢力的角逐之塲，而且自從我們擊敗日本之後，我們不斷在退縮，蘇聯不斷在佔優勢。</p>
<p>在一九四二年甚至還遲些，中國的情形是極適宜於我們作長期的投資，以促進世界的和平與進步。投資的數額可能是小的，並且無論如何不會比我們就是沒有這種很好的收穫的希望而也應該作的投資來得多。除了物質援助之外，所需的投資不過是在觀念上和一個盟國發展光榮的關係，而這個盟國之傾向我們，早已非常顯明的了。</p>
<p>可是這雖然是更容易和更有利的途徑，但是要發覺它並且遵循它，却需相當廣大和深刻的眼光，而我國推行對華政策者却是盲目的。</p>
<p>在帮助中國作戰的時候，我們可以利用我們斡旋的力量來促進中國政府自行改進，而不必設法把她的政府分裂開來，可以誘使中國的武裝部隊實行必要的改革而不必設法來接管它們的指揮權，可以培植中國共產黨員的和平轉變而不必去增强他們的要求和擴大他們的野心。在每一方面，我們都走錯了路，放棄了第一個辦法而贊成第二個辦法。或者當我們嘗試第一個辦法的時候，我們同時又嘗試第二個辦法，致使我們的努力，徒勞無功。</p>
<p>自從一九三七年日本開始進攻以來，中國變成愈來愈依賴美國的援助。自從一九四一年珍珠港事變發生以後，她生存的希望完全寄托在美國的帮助之上，而她的軍事命運也和我們的併在一起了。在這種情形之下，存在着我們最大的機會。</p>
<p>在日本發動征服中國之前，年輕的中華民國共和國雖曾大踏步向前進展，可是在國民然之內，還有一種反抗西方思想與政府以及公共福利觀念的勢力。</p>
<p>我們在華的勢力假如予以準確的運用，就可以减小國民黨反動份子的力量，而可以促進黨內更自由份子的地位。這個步驟，在本質上很簡單的。中央政府中有一種自然的傾向，就是把它對美的關係托付予講我們的吾言的這種人，無論是在實際上或者在比喩上講。這使在國外求過學一般地說是進步的贊成中國文化現代化和自由化的中國人抬頭。我們祗要能够運用我們對中國人的關係上這種已經存在的有利之點就可以了。</p>
<p>但是有一個先決條件，就是我們在對待中國人時，必須以平等與互信爲基礎。假如美國人以猜疑與不同身份來對待對方的中國人。那就不能發生作用。甚至在較低級方面相處得不錯而在高級方面缺乏友善之意的情形之下，也不能有良好的結果。</p>
<p>負責我們軍事外交政策的美國人，照例可以選擇一條康莊大道，就是經由中國自蔣主席以下的自由進步份子而建立一種有利而持久的美國勢力，但是他們却採取猜疑和自命不凡的小路。有時候我們的官方態度，猶如戰區司令部所表現的，簡直接近侮辱和公開的仇視—不但對自由份子是如此，就是對整個重慶政府也是一樣。</p>
<p>假如經由我們的鼓勵進步份子，能够表示他們可以來處理對美關係，那麼他們可能在整個國民黨中佔有顯要地位。因此中央政府和中國將見加强，很可能—雖然不一定—中國共產黨可能會離開他們馬克思主義領袖，而在蘇聯可以利用中國的共產黨作爲她戰後擴張的爪牙以前，全國已經團結了。</p>
<p>無論如何，靠增强中國政府的辦法來增强中國，可以阻抑中國共產黨的任何重大企岡。</p>
<p>這種說理大部份是屬於「可能是如此」的一類之內，但我相信它顯示出戰時我國援華政策在運用上的缺乏理想。</p>

<h3>南京路車禍死傷七人　浙江候補參議員罹難　大誠綢廠汽車衝上人行道演慘劇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午四時十分，熱鬧之南京路上，突發生汽車衝上人行道，傷亡七人之慘劇，浙省候補參議員金錦柏當塲慘遭輾斃。肇禍汽車爲五三九二一號藍色順風牌新車，係安遠路一九〇號火誠織綢廠主宋寳林所有，出事前該車由宋友高某借往大西路樂園殯儀館，紙樂園後，司機楊松源即駕駛空車，擬返北京東路二六六號該廠發行所，經南京東路利濟藥房門口時，天雨路滑，因普讓三輪車過急，竟衝上行人道，首先將王興昌西服號有邊玻璃櫥窗撞破，當時適有溫嶺人金錦柏擇其堂弟金振鐸，及其十金持衝自新雅餐畢，擬往大光明看翡翠谷影片，同時被撞倒地，因汽車仍在滑行，金錦柏遂被曳至品珍珠寳號門首，額部削去，後腦軋扁，腦漿四濺，慘不忍覩，當塲身死；金振鐸及金持衡則僅左腿與頭皮擦傷。</p>
<p>此外尙有路人高金宛，高金蘭湯榮靑，周趙阿玉等四人，亦被撞受傷。高金宛大腹割破，腦部受震暈厥，後經車送仁濟醫院救治，終以傷重殞命。高年僅十二歲，住澳門路卅號，高金蘭爲其胞姊，兩人均在學校讀書，被撞後高金蘭僅額部裂傷。</p>
<p>據事後調查，金錦柏現任浙江省溫嶺縣參議員，及補省參議員，四十九歲，去年六七月間，由溫　其妻及一子二女遷居來滬，住閔行路一〇六號美蓉公寓二〇六室。昨日上午，其堂弟金洪　自鄕間來滬，金特約同其在滬之堂弟金逮垂，金振鐸，及子金持衡，爲金洪達在寓設宴接風，並購就大光明第二塲電影票五張，因時間尙早，遂同往新雅小憇，席間商定晚間在會賓樓晚餐。自新雅出後，金洪達及金遠垂步行較速，金錦柏，金振鐸，金持衡三人則並肩緩步，兩者相距不遠，詎料俄頃之間，慘劇發生，五人中一死兩傷，而其餘二人竟幸吿無恙。現金錦柏家屬已延請律師，決向法院提出訴訟，追究肇事責任。</p>
<p>至受傷者中，尙有湯榮靑爲紹興人，在某證券交易所爲茶役，額部裂傷，周趙阿玉昨方自溫州鄕間來滬，探視其在王興昌爲女館之小姑，正在門首問訊，不料竟遭撞及，左腿骨折斷，傷者經送院包紥後，已無大礦。肇事後，老閘警分局曾精密測量車行速度，證明當時車速不過十五碼，據司機供稱，出事主因，爲道路過滑，閃避太急，煞車無法控制。司機楊松源經扣押後，曾數度企圖自殺，均以警局看管嚴密未果。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上月廿七日晨吳淞鎭泰興路附近河浜中發現身穿軍服之男屍一具，主犯兇手孫發舉已於前日拘獲，幷捕獲從犯數名。緣死者名周明盛，徐州人，四十二歲，前在八十八師砲兵團任職，現爲空軍高射砲兵第四團伙夫·數月前，與軍工路張華浜口開設小雜貨店之孫發舉（宿遷人卅二歲）認識，將現金三百餘萬存於孫店中生息，本利積有千餘萬。旋因不時過從，日久與孫妻張氏發生苟且，孫微有所聞，因此懷恨而生殺念。</p>

<h3>雷諾昨晨飛南京　向我方承認失禮　建議重行出發探險</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京三日電〕雷諾三日在中央研究院中向該院十二人委員會承認渠在夭折之積石山探勘事務中，對中國方面之發起人負有「失禮及思慮欠周」之處。研究院又得雷諾之公開保證，在探險隊中中國隊員返抵南京及各事處置結束前，「探險家」號巨型機決不離華。委員會又要求雷諾發表聲明稱，中國隊員已竭其全力襄贊探險事項，雷諾允諾後，該會同意將罷華機塲之武裝衛士一人撤去。雷諾提出反建議，一俟飛機修竣，　行出發探勘積石山。委員會主席薩本棟答稱，在與隊員會商前，該會不能答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷諾之探險機前晚自印度折返後，雷諾本人於昨晨乘中航機晋京，其探險機則停置於龍　機塲，由機塲當局滛衛看守，須待　妥手續後始准其離華。</p>
<p>雷諾之探險機，於一日下午由平飛返上海，二日淸晨六時〇六分不吿而別，駕機離滬，於失蹤十三小時後，又於二日下午六時三刻折返上海。據雷諾自云：在飛往加爾各答途中，因忽發現護照簽證已滿期，故而折返上海。</p>
<p>據昨日雷諾之機師奧發稱二此次離滬，因急欲返國，並無突然之處。繼又稱：探險之舉取消，飛機一再發生障故爲次因，主因爲人心失却信仰，無人欲冒生命危險搭此飛機，故雷諾爲避免不必要之浪費金錢，遂不願探險繼續進行。</p>
<p>對爲何未得允可而逕自離滬一點，奧登答稱，彼等於二晨駕機飛離時，曾得民航局空中管制塔之許可。彼等擬取道歐洲返國，原因爲雷諾不願在太平洋上空作長距維飛行，取　歐洲，可短送隨時降落，此外又可循便至巴黎一行，因雷諾於該地有事待理也。故離滬後逕飛加爾各答。後因中途發覺護照簽證已滿期，故乃折回，重擬取道太平洋返國。</p>
<p>探險機突然離滬　未得民航局許可</p>
<p>唯據民航局龍華航空站林主任祖心稱，雷諾此次突然離滬，并未辦齊必需手續，故於接獲京方電報後，曾發電促該機返滬，然未接獲回電。事實上該機起飛後即與地面斷絕聯絡，是否赴加爾行答，不得而知。依照國際民航法規定，雷諾之探險機於離滬時需取得民航局之許可，而雷諾祇接得管制塔之飛行許可，逕自起飛，於法不合。蓋管制培僅負責空中飛行之氣候等技術問題也。且雷諾來華時，會向民航局取得飛行中國內地之證件，前晨突然離滬時，亦未繳還，故雷諾須辦齊各項手續，方可離滬。</p>
<p>雷諾返滬後，曾擬與林主任電話接觸，然未接通，昨晨電諾曾遣副機師薩里至民航局航空站探詢手續。</p>
<p>又訊：據中央研究院駐滬辦事處陳主任荻帆吿記者，雷諾於昨晨飛京後，迭與南京方面之美國黨局接觸，下午則與蕯本棟氏等會商。雷諾在滬時曾稱：赴京將建議探險仍繼續舉行，全都科學人員由中國方面担任。</p>
<p>對探險突告結束　華許本表示失望</p>
<p>積石山探險團科學顧問華許本，昨日爲雷諾不吿而別，取消探險一舉，發表離明如下：</p>
<p>「積石山探險團美國方面之科學人員，對於二天前雷諾飛離北平後之行動，並不知曉。雷諾於三月三十日晚宣佈探險正式結束，彼吿我等於次日在滬會晤。迨余於昨晚搭中航機抵滬時，於龍華機塲獲悉雷諾一行已於淸晨飛加爾各答。三小時後，余始知彼留言於某友人，囑余電話告知中央研究院薩本棟博士，匆匆離華，甚爲遺憾。</p>
<p>「余尙未接通南京之長途電話，某新聞記者來吿雷諾之飛機，於飛赴加爾各答十三小時後又折返上海。雷諾返滬後，探險團之科學人員，並未會晤，除報上所載之消息外，其他詳情，一無所知。</p>
<p>「吾人對此次中美雙方科學人員經數月準備之探險突然結束，甚感失望。對中國科學家及人民所予之歡迎，甚爲感激。中美雙方科學人員對探險之各項枝節皆甚融洽，蕯本棟博士如認爲余能協助結束探險事宜，余擬留此盡力協助。」</p>

<h3>改訂對日私人貿易政策　行政院已決定原則</h3>
<p>對日私人貿易，自私人代表赴日後，迄已多日，仍無結果·此中最大原因，厥為日本物資缺乏，以致　法成交。據悉：政府對於對日私人貿易政策，決從新考慮，將另行改訂。此事政院已於本月一日在京召集財部·經部·中央銀行·輸管會等有關機關，一度會商，已決定原則：</p>
<p>（一）輸出物資，欧美有銷路者，輸往歐美銷售。</p>
<p>（二）對日私人貿易之管理，由輸管會負責，輸出入貿易，統由輸管會簽證。</p>
<p>是項政策改訂以後，並不影響對日貿易，因輸日物資，经輸管會統計，達二百八十餘種之多。至改訂目的，在謀換取更多之外匯，因與日本交易純係記賬方式也。</p>

<p>麵粉　初市再跌三四萬元，中市以後，以客帮有進，店方略有添補，又轉向回升，收市行情兵船為一五三萬五千，建成為一三二萬五千，紅蜂一三一萬七千，較前略漲五千至一萬五千元不等。麩皮鄕帮客銷略暢，福新阜豐大包各漲三萬五千元。</p>
<p>食油　仍以廠方未售貨，大有餘回籠單上升為七三三萬元，廠生菜油亦漲為七〇五萬，各升廿五萬元。生油蔴油變動較小，江北靑島吉桶加廿萬，吉小車蔴油漲十萬元。</p>
<p>豆餅　因汕帮有動，生記仁記各漲四萬元，漢口乍豆初市猛跌十萬，後以上游價漲，進貨者多，收盤回漲，較昨反漲五萬元。蠶豆略减三萬元，赤豆菉豆平定，生仁漲跌不一，秦皇島跌五萬，大汶口漲五萬。芝蔴苞米紅糧均見下隆，漢口白蔴小五萬，姜堰紅糧跌七萬元，苞米客帮稍進，黃渡啓東各加兩萬元。</p>

<h3>茶價步漲</h3>
<p>昨茶市仍因國內外去化踵趾相接，買戶續抱傾資進攻之念，市上存底迄未砌增，供應遂猶不暢，交易始終欠佳。本年度新茶雖瞬即登塲，但以一切繳用浩火，開價決難抑低，因此目前執主對於陳貨，一味不忍輕易割愛，且喊價漸有與日同增之勢云。</p>
<h3>溫州明前下跌</h3>
<p>溫州明前龍井，自上月中旬獻新後，因到貨不繼，開價驚人。昨又有茶商自產地採運來滬，數量較夥，惟貨品較老，不若上次之鮮嫩，故其開價亦已低廉，每斤喊三十五萬元，比上届軋降十五萬元許。</p>

<h3>銀根見鬆客銷轉暢　棉紗由疲回堅　布疋買氣不振做開稀少</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根趨鬆，本街同業頗多吸納，客路天津漢口等帮去化輯暢，市勢田疲趨堅。四十二支藍鳳細紗初開即躍升八百萬元，叩二億元大關，嗣以利賣消息頻傳，浮空活動，驟降至一億九千一百萬元。迨至近收時，聞布市回振，人心重見興奪，市盤回昂，一以億九千三百萬元收市，比之上日回漲一百萬元</p>
<p>四十二支金城高至一億九千一百萬結束，軋升三四百萬，二十一支雙馬紗晨開價亦跳高五百萬，為一億二千二百萬元，旋傳美貸已正式通過，物價可望穩定之說，人心回軟，檯面帮浮戶拋售，中途市氣一度下挫，臨收有人見低進取，回上至一億二千三百萬元收市，較上日軋升六百萬元　其餘四十支及卅二支各脾，普漲二三百萬至七八百萬之間，二十支及十六支等粗紗，因複製廠商乘低稍有添補，回漲二三百萬元左右。</p>

<h3>從兒童節說到兒童福利事業　為卅七年兒童節作</h3>
<p>— 陳鐵生</p>
<p>今天是第十七屆兒童節，在全國各地都有盛大的紀念和慶祝。這是一年一度的集會，每年的今日有許多執心兒童工作者和慈幼事業的同志們，撰文發表他們對於兒童節的希望，理想，或建議，乃至作進一步的呼籲。可是一年一度經過一次盛大集會後，便隨着春光等閒過去了，許多高深寳貴的意見，亦成為即景的文章，從未達成這盛大集會創始的眞義，和當前兒童敎養問題的中心任務。吾人對於已往的十六屆兒童節平淡的渡過，深覺慚愧！</p>
<p>今日兒童在國家範　內所處的地位，任何人都知道他們是未來的主人翁，文化的創造者，歷史的繼承人，他們肩負着未來偉大的責任。但是怎樣才能使這下一代主人翁，負起這樣偉大的任務來，誰都知道，這不是從事兒童福利工作同志單獨應負的責任，是需要全國的成年人，以及家長，敎師們，北同負起這個責任，勤苦培植，才能使下一代的國民，堅强的站立起來</p>
<p>兒童問題，的確是一切社會問題的根本問題，尤其在我們多難的中國，不僅是在校的兒童敎育問題，及贫苦兒童救濟敎養等問題，社會上還有封建遺傳下的不合理的習慣，類如蓄養童工，婢女，及童養媳等惡習。創始舉辦兒童節，雖然經過十六年來，全國熟心人士共同努力，但還未能把這些惡習剷除淨盡。這不僅是法律責任，亦是嚴重的社會問題。進一步說，這是我們從事兒童福利工作每一個同志，應負的責任。我們應該隨時向社會提出注意，作一個正確的調查和統計，協助政府糾正風俗，用文學圖畫廣爲宣傳，務使全國成年人都知道兒童有獨立的人格，兒童絕不是屬於父母私人的，要噢起全國上下的覺悟，作最大的努力，使下一代得以健全，我們的國家才能鞏固，地位才能提高。</p>
<p>基於上面的問題，每年兒童節的舉行，其意義不僅是集會慶祝，應該有一個共同的目標，把一切兒童問題歸納起來，作有系統的研究，俾供兒童福利工作同志採擇；並聯合全國有關兒童福利機構，分別推行，似可先就上海一地試辦，擬自今年今天起到明年今天止，希望能有一個永久性的紀念物產生，類如兒童樂園，兒童療養院，兒童電影院，兒童圖書館等，集合同志捐募，視其財力環境擇其中之一定期完成，不要把這偉大而重要的集會，只舉行空洞的慶祝就算了事。希望全市兒童福利國體的同志們，更當重視這一個偉大的節日，向着我們共同的目標努力，達成上項任務，加意培育下一代，果能如是，我國兒童福利事業不難走上光明的道路。</p>
<h3>足球甲組聯賽　東青決戰　今日下午三時在逸園</h3>
<p>三屆足球聯賽甲組華人兩巨頭東華與靑白兩隊，定今日下午三時在逸園決奪本屆王座，門票仍售普通四萬及特別六萬兩種，普通座限一萬五千張，特別座限三千張，自上午九時起開始在市體育館預售。逸園大門十二時開放，觀衆歸票後須於下午二時前進塲。裁判吳守衡，巡邊陳吉祥何春暉。</p>
<p>除甲組外，尙有丙三組決賽及幼級盃二塲，上午十时在中正公園角逐，全部秩序如次：</p>
<p>靑白靑—東華（甲組決）下午三時逸園</p>
<p>靑白乙—中紡（幼級盃）上午十時中一</p>
<p>羣力—精武（幼級盃）上午十時中二</p>
<p>蔭隊—新豐（丙三決）上午十時中三</p>
<p>東華會乃上屆聯甲冠軍，鬥力雄厚，本届更銳意圖强，除全部老將外，復逖得南國好手謝錦洪，陳家萬，夏體先三騎士助陣，益覺錦上添花，今日出塲軍容，昨由賈幼良公佈家萬右移，錦洪任左衛，林根替代於洽興，其餘無變動，謝在香島時，以左後衛最擅長，但自來滬後，因阿孫腿傷，幼良退休，前鋒綫上人材寥落，故謝客串內錄，今得復任衛職，當能盡量發揮，與陳家萬一搭一檔，必可與靑白吳嚴一別「苗頭」，林根與孫老戎因傷久疏戰事，茲番重披征衣，攻守雙方，實力並見增厚，其餘人馬亦均為首流人選，配備整齊，極為理想。</p>
<p>靑白靑上屆聯賽雖屆居亞軍，但市長盃則擊退東華，蟬聯錦標。後衛吳嚴鐵閘，固膾炙人口，無庸多作介紹；中衛綫盃義良近况彌佳，釘人功夫高出一籌，高保正穩健有加，滿塲飛奔，不但能守，且可助攻，前鋒有阿福統率三軍，陷陣衝鋒，必大有作為，而門將秦必高今晨可自港趕到，是以全隊陣容亦殊堅挺，屆時一番龍虎鬥，固未卜鹿死誰手也。兩隊陣容及甲組形勢分錄於次</p>

<h3>孩子們</h3>
<p>— 陳烟帆</p>
<p>報戲聯合國勸募兒童救濟金中國委員會會長蔣夫人函國大代表請捐一日所得以救濟世界三萬萬受難兒童。夫人近接岳陽一個七歲女孩趙慧敏來電，由中農銀行匯來捐款十萬元，響應　所倡導的勸募兒童救濟金運動，見之頗多感慨。</p>
<p>推想起來中國的受難兒童在三萬萬中至少可佔一萬萬。刋載上項消息的同日天津民國日報有一段開封通訊，記述汴梁街頭在同一天裏面鬻子悲劇竟有三起。他說：「相國寺後街，一個鄕下打扮的婦人，濕淋淋的頭巾，半　着憔悴的面龐，懷裏兜着一個剛滿八月的男孩，……含着眼淚，向過往的行人聲言要賣五百萬元。」「……偏僻窄狹的木廠街，泥漿裏站着一個半　的中年男子，索六百萬元的代價，出賣他剛滿月的活寳寳。……他是封邱難民馮金安。一家五口，斷炊兩日，才出此下策。」「同日下午六時許，草市街也有一個婦人，出賣她四個月的男孩，索價六百萬元。」</p>
<p>五六百萬元在今日雖是戔戔之數，但是在途窮的人們倒底還能靠它延續十天半月的生命。災荒離亂的時候，孩子們是向來要最先　過厄運的，出賣或者易子而食，那是「古已有之」的了。然而在社會文明進步到二十世紀的令日，那種事實仍然流行，使人眞有人間何世之感。</p>
<p>大人們向來是未曾注意孩子們的重要；即使有兒童節之類也不過僅在那一天狂捧一下而已。如果有災荒，救濟也是先及大人。筆者在靑島時遇見幾個窮苦的兒童，現在也可順便說起。有一次在一家飯館裏晚餐，來了二個擦皮鞋的孩子，他們吿訴我擦鞋有時候一天沒有生意。靑島不比上海，擦鞋人多而講究靴子人少。他們的擦鞋用具——一個簡單的小木箱等是美國軍人替他們買的，那孩子說「二年了，用了美金五角。」看他們樣子眞可憐，一則十來歲的年紀不是養活自己的時候，二則即使生意好時一日所得也吃不飽，受敎育當然不是他們所可夢想的事。我再吿訴你們，靑島有着大批沒有一副擦鞋傢伙的孩子們，一天到晚跟着美軍和體面的商人乞討，少有人施捨，生活更不如那二個孩子。飯店裏時時右十歲上下，十五六歲的孩子來兜售當天的報紙，畫報，他們是學生。他們穿着襤褸的衣服，一張缺乏營養的黃臉。我在瀋陽時也常常過到，平津也隨處都是可憐的孩子們。我相信右更多生活在苦難中的孩子我沒有看到，我的心很沉重，我不知道怎樣可以帮助他們。</p>
<h3>灰鼠</h3>
<p>— 聃笱</p>
<p>這可愛的小動物——灰鼠，它的生活情形，恐怕你知道不很多，這裏就來作一點簡單的介紹。南美冰天雪地的安第斯山是出產灰鼠炒豐富的地方，據當地土人說：遠在一五二四年，人類開始發現灰鼠而利川它的皮來做衣服，於是在這四百年中，當地的製皮工業逐漸地興盛起來，因此灰鼠就被捕捉殆盡。直至一九一八年，秘魯，智利和玻利維亞政府當局，申令禁止灰鼠皮出口，因此灰鼠總算沒有遭到像渡渡鳥（渡渡烏爲毛里西斯島所產之巨烏，現已滅絕）一樣的厄運。</p>
<p>說起灰鼠的生活情形，最令人感覺有趣的事，莫過於它們的家庭生活了。因爲灰鼠的家庭生活跟人類　蕪軒　，耀灰鼠居然會向雌灰鼠「求婚」。如果「求婚」成勒的話，它們一對就度着「一夫一妻」制的家庭生活，但是「求婚」往往也有被拒絕的可能。</p>
<p>一對灰鼠結合一年以後，就要生產，每次生產小灰鼠約從一隻至四隻，但是通常多每次二隻。小灰鼠剛生下來的時候，眼睛就能張開看東西，身體像人手的大姆指一樣大小，活潑異常，跑來跑去，像一個小羢球在地上打滾，非常有趣。當時大灰鼠從窩裏跑出跑進，忙碌非凡，照顧他的嬰兒和產母。</p>
<p>灰鼠的繁殖力非常强，在五年中一對灰鼠可以生產出三十對至三十二對之多。它們的壽命？通常可以活到七年。</p>
<p>灰鼠愛吃的是嫩苗，紫苜蓿和乾草之類，但是它們食量很小，每一對灰鼠一天所食不過三盎司而已</p>
<p>據從事灰鼠業的人說：戰後各地需要灰鼠皮量激增，形成求過於供的情形。因爲牧塲裏所出售的皮，都是揀老弱無能的灰鼠，所以不够供應了。</p>
<h3>吃白食的故事</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>據說，在天氣晴如的初春的某一天，紐約一家當麗堂皇的旅館門外一處公園內，坐着兩個衣冠楚楚的中年紳士。坐在左首的那一位，笑嘻嘻的對他座旁的初交說：「這家旅館，設備很講究，是不是？今天，我很想到旅館的屋頂花園去，暢暢快快的吃一頓精美的大餐。不過，有一件小事很抱歉，我的袋中，却沒有半文錢！」</p>
<p>另一人說：「這正怪極了，我也沒有帶錢呢。」隔了一會兒，他接下去說：「我倒想出一個好主意。我們兩人大家都穿得很氣概。我們不妨上屋頂花園去，在菜單上挑選最可口的小菜和佳釀，餐畢在侍者向我們算帳以前，可以向他借一枚角子來，用擲角子看正反面的方法，來決定誰可以吃白食，誰該留在那　對付侍者。」第一人聞言，連連稱善。</p>
<p>他們吃的那一頓飯，非常愉快。食物烹調迴口，席間談笑風生。那一枚角子，已經借來，安放在桌子上。這時，第一個人却吞吞吐吐，欲言又止。最後，他說：一朋友，我很對不起你，我有一些欺騙你。我在公園中對你說，身邊沒有半文錢，眞是千眞萬確，但是請你不要爲了這筆經費發愁，我就可以打發人到我的家中取來。我很有錢呢。我今犬早上換了一套新衣服，忘記把皮夾等零物放在袋中了。事實上，如果你一定要我吐露實話，我擁有這裏最値錢的一處地產。」</p>
<p>另一人高聲大笑道：「我想我和你半斤八兩，我早該和你認識了。你也許不知道，我就是這座旅館的主人呢。」</p>
<h3>私生子</h3>
<p>— 毛毅</p>
<p>直到現在，社會對私生子還是帶着歧視的眼光。但是，私生子爲甚麼要受汚辱呢？他們對於自己的出世根本不能够負甚麼責任。</p>
<p>私生子是自從人類有了婚姻觀念以來就存在的，各時代和各地對待他們的態度雖然是以歧視居多，不過，其中也有所不同。在耶穌紀元以前，雅典人對付私生子的方法是將他們棄置於露天，任他們凍餒而死。羅馬人對私生子一樣的蔑視，並且將他們分爲兩類：一類是淫慾的產物；另一類是愛情的結晶，分別給他們定有特別的稱呼。</p>
<p>古代日耳曼的法律僅寬容父母的社會階級相等的私生子，對於他種的私生子則認爲不合法。</p>
<p>法蘭西民族素來浪漫，他們在封建時代對私生子就無特殊的侮衊，他們承認私生子有與嫡子相同的繼承權。許多國王在外沾花惹草所製造出來的小國民，在日後同樣的能够獲得爵位和特權；不過，有一個限制，他們不能够入承大統，　承法　西王位。</p>
<p>在義大利，早在六世紀，耶穌敎堂就想設立育嬰堂以制止未婚的父母棄殺嬰兒。在十二世紀，敎皇英諾森三世在羅馬正式設立了一個育嬰堂。育嬰堂外　着一個籃子，嬰兒放進去之後，祗要拉動響鈴，裏面就有修道女出來把棄嬰抱去，代替不負責任的父母將他扶養長大。這抓收容私生子的方法傳播很廣，義大利各地和西班牙，南美洲，葡萄牙，都模仿採用。</p>
<p>時代在進展，法律對私生子的保障也日益增加。但是，勢利的社會依然在歧視無辜的私生子——這是衛道觀念在作祟。</p>
<h3>談愛錢</h3>
<p>— 翼君</p>
<p>平常一談到愛錢是很難聽的，愛錢，已成卑鄙的代名詞。</p>
<p>但實際上錢爲什麼不可愛呢？吃飯要錢，穿衣要錢，住房子要錢，行路要錢，治病要錢，娛樂要錢，受敎育要錢，交朋友要錢，結婚要錢，生孩子要錢……何事不要錢？何處不要錢？錢多者，可以滿足生活上較多較高的要求，錢少者，僅可滿足較少較低的要求，無錢者，根本不足以滿足生存的要求，只好鳴呼哀哉，然則人們之要錢，不亦宜乎？</p>
<p>而且錢幣本身，旣具美麗的外貎，又極輕便，區區一紙，便抵萬金，無怪乎人們唯恐錢之不多了。</p>
<p>因之，爲了錢，貪汚，囤積，搶刦，詐騙，剝削，吝嗇，就不可避免了。</p>
<p>假如人們生活上的需求，不須藉金錢以滿足，則錢有什麼可愛？誰會愛牠？因此我想，如世界上索性廢掉這錢這種東西，豈不甚好！大家不用錢，薪津工酬概以實物發給，商業買賣，以實物相交換。如此一來，錢旣無用，實物又嫌累贅不便，結果怎樣呢？錢不愛了，不必說　，就是實物也定不會像貪錢一般那樣貪多無饜了—這是一法。</p>
<p>另有一法是：請科學家發明一種極精巧的方法，以垃圾泥土爲原料，鑄造貨幣，此種貨幣，須留有臭氣，比重甚高，携帶不便，形狀醜陋，有稜刺手，當然仍要謹防僞造；這樣也許會减低人們對錢的興趣，因而省却許多罪惡吧？</p>
<p>在非錢不足以維持生命的世界，若不照我的方法，責人愛錢，簡直等於殺人了，你說對不對？</p>
<h3>彼得大帝的夢想</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>據說在兩百年前的某一天，舊俄彼得大帝在皇宮里散步，看見陽光從牕外射進來，他忽然想道：</p>
<p>「有窗子，，能有陽光和新鮮空氣流進來。我的大帝國因爲沒有窗子，所以這樣的寒冷而陰暗，我必須爲我的大帝國開一扇窗子！」</p>
<p>他所謂「帝國窗子」就是指出一個不凍的出海口。</p>
<p>他於是拿起一幅地圖，在上面細細研究。他的眼睛在西歐部分注視一回，搖搖頭，嘆一口氣說：</p>
<p>「我如果想從波羅的海找一個出海口，現在是沒有我的份了。」</p>
<p>他的祖綫便轉到亞洲部分，終於狠狠地釘視着海參威——這是一個很好的東方出海口。</p>
<p>他不禁得意忘形大笑起來。</p>
<p>才笑了不久，他的臉上就起了暗影。他憂鬱地望着地岡上的西伯利亞茫茫大草原，又引起一個困難問題：</p>
<p>「我們怎樣才能通過這萬里無邊的曠野，到達海參成呢？」</p>
<p>他思慮了很久，始終想不出一個辦法。最後，他發憤拿起一支鵝毛筆，狠狠地在那幅地圖上畫了一根籃色直綫——從莫斯科直達海參威。畫完了，他微帶怒意的自言自語說：</p>
<p>「讓我在夢裏從這條直綫飛到海參咸吧！</p>
<p>若千年後，彼得大帝亡故。研究皇帝遺稿的臣僚，找到這幅地圖，並且看到這條藍色直綫。他們集體研究了好久，終於得到一個結論：皇帝一定是在夢想實現一條路綫直達海參威。</p>
<p>「不能讓皇帝的夢想失望！」這是大臣們的一致意見。</p>
<p>於是　八十年以後，這條用鵝毛筆隨便畫在地圖上的藍色直綫，終於變成兩條萬里的鋼軌——這就是西伯利亞鐵路建築的歷史。</p>
<h3>徐文長論詩的模倣</h3>
<p>— 弘賢</p>
<p>作詩本來貴乎翻新，要有獨創的風格才算是好詩，然而世俗却崇尙模仿，結果使詩歌少了發展的機會；偶而翻看徐文長全集，在他的葉子肅詩序篇內有一段高論，是專論棋仿二字，說的話別右風趣，現在抄了下來，以作詩人的參考：</p>
<p>「人有學爲鳥言者，其音則鳥也，其性則人也；鳥有學爲人言者，其音則人也，而性則鳥也。此可以定人與鳥之衡哉？今之為詩者，何以異於是，不出於己之所自得，而徒竊於人之所嘗言曰：某篇是某體，某篇則否；某句似某人，某句則否。此雖然極工，逼肖而已，不免於鳥之爲人言矣！」</p>

<h3>即小見大</h3>
<p>— 雷紅</p>
<p>我們這時代爲孩子定下一個兒童節，大概是特別感到今日的孩子，即明日的國家柱石，如其從基礎上注意起來，當然不但是救救孩子，而是還是「救救國家」的好辦法。然而兒童節我們要做的，並不是揀某幾個白白胖胖的嬌生慣養的孩子拍幾張照片，或者是讓一批原來家長們保養得很好的有限的幾個孩子，到電影院裏去看一塲電影，就算敷衍過了一個兒童節的。我們應該注意到一般孩子的活動力，思考力，性格，習慣，使從幼稚發展到成長的途徑才是。外國雜誌上常有關於兒童的小動作專欄，以爲父母們即小見大的參考，固不俟兒童節才注意到兒童的種種也。時當令節，我們也可急起直追，爰譯述幾節兒童小事以爲發軔。</p>
<p>午飯時候，五歲的裘麗，把匙放下來，向着母親說，「媽媽，我的湯裏有根　髮。」</p>
<p>「噓，孩子，母親有點惱怒，爲媽解釋道，「這是盆子上的一條裂痕呀。」</p>
<p>孩子拿起匙來攪動一些時候。「媽媽，」她追着問，「怎麼裂痕會動的？」</p>
<p>父親因爲六歲的孩子撒了一個大謊，駡了他一頓。「我像你這樣的年紀從來不講謊話，」父親怒氣冲冲地說。孩子呆了一會，於是問，「爸爸，那麼你幾歲開始說謊呢？」</p>
<p>鄰家一個孩子跑來問我，「媽媽，魔鬼是不是一個男人？」</p>
<p>我想何必吿訴她魔鬼與男人的聯繫，因此回答她道：「不，魔鬼比了男人更其惡劣，惡劣到不知多少。」她還有點弄不淸楚，問道：「你的意思是不是說，魔鬼是一個女人？</p>
<p>一個男人看他的　子和其他幾個男孩子在表演爭奪戰，於是喊他姪子來說：「史帝夫，如其你能在十五分鐘內佔領他們的堡壘，我給你二角五分錢！」三分鐘之後，孩子跑到叔叔那裏來報吿消息：在堡壘中的其他孩子已經投降了。</p>
<p>「這裏是二角五分錢，」叔叔說，「但是你怎樣使他們投降得這樣快？」</p>
<p>「我答應敵人分給他們一角錢，他們就投降了。」孩子說。</p>

<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 2nd] The communist bandits who once roamed Tongchuan and Yaoxian counties in Shaanxi Province gave the grain of Ji Zipeng, a resident of Hangu Village, to the local poor, distributing one or two dou per household. However, they then conducted a grain survey and forced those with more than one shi of stored grain to hand over five dou, and those with more than five shi to hand over six-tenths of it. Therefore, a poor household that originally had eight dou of grain, plus the two dou they were given, totaling one shi, was forced to give up five dou.</p>

<h3>National Assembly to Hold Sixth Preparatory Meeting Tomorrow; Re-electing the Presidium; Yesterday's Meeting Was Chaotic, and the Vote Was Invalid</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly issued a notice overnight on the 3rd, stating: "In the election of the Presidium at the Fifth Preparatory Meeting on this (3rd) day, due to incomplete procedures, there were errors. The acting chairman, after consulting with the Assembly and obtaining its consent, declared the election invalid and ordered a re-election. In addition to sealing the spoiled ballots on the spot for destruction, the acting chairman determined that the Sixth Preparatory Meeting will be held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on Monday, the 5th of this month, to re-conduct the election of the Presidium of the Assembly."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The National Assembly will be adjourned all day on the 4th. [Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The National Assembly conducted the election of the Presidium on the 3rd. In the morning, groups were selected to nominate candidates from each unit and candidates nominated by ten-person joint signatures. The list of these names was originally scheduled to be sent to the registration desk at the Assembly Hall before 10:00 AM in order to compile and print the ballots. However, because the conveners of each unit took time and the jointly signed lists arrived successively, some still had not arrived by 4:00 PM. Therefore, the Fifth Preparatory Meeting, originally scheduled for 4:00 PM, was delayed until 5:30 PM. Chairman Mo Dehui and Secretary-General Hong Guanyou announced the results of the candidate selections from each unit and the list of candidates nominated jointly by ten people. After the ballots were distributed, the election was conducted by secret ballot. Representatives designated by the chairman served as poll workers, and one representative from each unit served as a poll watcher. At 6:30 PM, staff members distributed ballots from the front rows to the back, and as ballots were distributed, voting began, and order gradually became chaotic. Around 7:00 PM, a corner of the hall erupted in disputes because ballots had not been distributed to everyone. The order in the hall was greatly disrupted. At that time, a representative from Hunan raised a serious question, asking why He Zhonghan, who had already been nominated as a candidate, was not printed on the ballot. At the same time, those seated in the back rows also shouted loudly that they had not received ballots. It turned out that when the staff members distributed the ballots, they used each row as a unit and passed them down from the first person. In the haste, the first representative in the row, after getting their ballot, was busy voting and did not have time to distribute it to the rest. When the remaining representatives did not receive ballots, they were re-issued, resulting in duplicate ballots. At that time, the hall was extremely chaotic, and the chairman had no choice but to temporarily announce that the election was invalid and that another date would be chosen for a re-vote.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Bilateral Aid Agreement; Negotiations to Proceed After Bill is Approved; President Zhang Expresses Gratification for American Aid</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun, speaking with reporters on the 3rd, expressed considerable gratification that the joint committee of the US Senate and House of Representatives had passed the worldwide aid bill, including $463 million in aid to China. However, he added cautiously: "This bill still needs to be passed individually by both houses." He believes that the methods and guarantees for China's use of this aid will not differ greatly from those applied to European countries receiving American aid. As for the bilateral agreement that will serve as the basis for the aid, China and the United States will conduct negotiations in Washington or Nanjing, and who will preside over them. When this work will begin depends on when the technical delegation sent by China to the United States for consultations, including Bei Zuyi, returns to report on the details of the negotiations and contacts in the United States. Only after careful study and consideration can a decision be made. However, Zhang stated that the date of return of Bei et al. is still undetermined. According to authoritative sources, both China and the United States have completed preparations for the negotiation of this bilateral agreement. As soon as the bill is signed and approved by President Truman, formal negotiations can begin and are expected to be signed and implemented quickly. The technical advisors, including Bei Zuyi, will only be able to return to China after this final task is completed.</p>

<h3>US Aid to China Act Provisions</h3>
<p>[Washington, DC, US News Agency, 2nd] The following is the full text of Chapter IV of the US Foreign Aid Act of 1948, concerning China:</p>
<p>Section 402: In view of the close economic and other relations between the United States and China, and in view of the fact that the divisions arising from the war are not limited to the borders of nations, the Congress believes that the current situation in China endangers the establishment of lasting peace, the public welfare and national interests of the United States, and the achievement of the goals of the United Nations. The Congress believes that the further development of the principles of individual liberty, freedom of association, and complete independence in China depends primarily on the continued development of a strong and democratic national government, as a basis for establishing sound economic conditions and stable international economic relations. In the large-scale markets within the United States, there are no trade barriers, which is of great advantage. The United States believes that China can produce similar advantages. The American people, being mindful of this, have declared their policy to encourage China and its people to implement sustained common efforts that will rapidly achieve peace and economic stability within China, all of which are necessary for lasting world peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is declared that the policy of the American people aims to encourage the efforts of the Republic of China, through aid programs based on self-help and cooperation, to maintain China's genuine independence and administrative integrity and to maintain and enhance the principles of individual liberty and free institutions within China; however, the aid intended for China must not seriously hinder the economic stability of the United States. Furthermore, it is declared that the policy of the United States is that the aid provided by the United States under this chapter should always rely on the cooperation of the Republic of China and its people to promote this program; however, the aid provided under this chapter should not be regarded as an explicit or implicit assumption that the United States has any practical responsibility for the policies, actions, or undertakings of the Republic of China, or for the circumstances that may exist in China at any time.</p>
<p>Section 403: The aid provided under this chapter shall be provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The purpose of this section is not to require China to become part of a joint program attached to the European Recovery Program in order to obtain the aid stipulated under this chapter.</p>
<p>Section 404: (A) To achieve the objectives of this section, the President is authorized to appropriate an amount not exceeding $338 million as aid to China, which may be used within one year from the date of implementation of this act. (B) In addition, the President is authorized to appropriate an amount not exceeding $125 million as additional aid to China in the form of grants, the conditions of which may be determined by the President, without regard to the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, and may be used within one year from the date of implementation of this act.</p>
<p>Section 405: China and the United States shall sign an agreement containing guarantees undertaken by China, which, after consultation between the Secretary of State and the Economic Cooperation Administrator, are deemed necessary to achieve the purposes of this section and to improve commercial relations with China.</p>
<p>Section 406: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall, before the appropriation is implemented under Section 404, advance an amount not exceeding $50 million to carry out the objectives of this chapter, in such manner and amount as the President may determine. The amount advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall be deducted from the appropriation authorized under Section 404, but no interest shall be paid. The Treasury Department shall not charge interest on the amount advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</p>
<p>Section 407: (A) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Administrator, is authorized to enter into an agreement with China to establish a "Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in China," composed of two American citizens appointed by the President of the United States and three Chinese citizens appointed by the President of China. This commission, under the direction and management of the Administrator, shall formulate and implement plans for the reconstruction of rural areas in China, including necessary research and training activities, but the United States shall not be responsible for further contributions. (B) To the extent possible, up to one percent of the funds specified in Section 404(A) shall be used to achieve the objectives of Section (A) of this section. The payment of this amount may be made in US dollars or in Chinese legal tender obtained from the sale of materials, or a combination of both.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Cultivating the Seedlings of a New China</h3>
<p>—Expectations for National School Teachers and Parents on Children's Day—</p>
<p>Today is the 17th Children's Day, a beloved holiday for all children across the country. In this bright spring season, various commemorative celebrations are being held in this city and throughout the nation. We can imagine countless innocent and lively children excitedly celebrating today, as well as many hardworking teachers finding solace in their sacred duties. Furthermore, many toiling parents, burdened by life's hardships, face the next generation with endless expectations. Throughout our entire country, if the old branches are being ruthlessly eroded by wind and frost, then countless flourishing children represent the vigorous buds and seedlings of a new China, sprouting and growing. From the tireless progress of children and young people, we gladly see a bright future for the nation and the people.</p>
<p>Based on this reason, today we want to offer our congratulations to all the children in the country, and we also want to extend our deepest respect and comfort to the teachers and parents who nurture and protect these countless seedlings. In today's era of high living costs, the livelihood of children is a heavy burden for every parent; public education personnel and working farmers who rely on their salaries generally find it not easy to raise and educate their children. As for the teachers of national schools, while diligently teaching other people's children, they also try hard to bear the cost of their own children's food, clothing, and schooling, and there are often cases of dropping out of school or even suffering from cold and hunger, which deserves our sympathy even more. The foundation of the country's future lies in children, so we sincerely hope that the government will pay more attention to national basic education in the future, improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, promote children's welfare work, effectively protect child labor, and gradually establish social legislation and systems to provide special subsidies for the education and upbringing of public education employees with many children.</p>
<p>How to effectively nurture our new Chinese seedlings, so that they can develop and grow healthily, our hope is naturally placed more on the teachers who work hard to teach children all year round, and the parents who endure hardships and burdens to raise their children. They are the gardeners to whom our country entrusts this arduous task. However, our country has always neglected the physical and mental development of children, and even now, there are still very few who are fully fulfilling the parental duties of raising and educating their children; and with the popularization and progress of elementary school education, we all know that those who have the closest contact with children's lives and who can influence and lead them the most are still their teachers. Therefore, on this Children's Day, we especially hope that national school teachers will do their best to fulfill their joyful responsibility of nurturing the future masters of China.</p>
<p>China's national education has indeed made a lot of progress in the past decade. In terms of system, we formulated the National School Law during the war, which complemented the implementation of county autonomy; in terms of methods, there were more experiments, research and improvements. What is strange is that recently, we have seen that the transfer and change of jobs by teachers is particularly common in national schools, and in rural elementary schools, there are even more cases of unqualified people taking over as a result. On the one hand, we often hear their voices sighing and complaining about life. Due to this frustration and injustice, the reduction in the efficiency of children's education is incalculable. We naturally demand an increase in the treatment of national teachers; at the same time, we would like to say a word to the teachers: Education work is indeed hard, but to cultivate the future masters for the country, and to receive the love and respect of the purest infants in the world, the task is sacred and the spirit is joyful. The work of nurturing new Chinese seedlings is the most immortal. May you not belittle yourselves, and you will naturally receive the respect of society. As for parents, they must also pay more attention to the physical and mental health of their children, so that the family maintains a good atmosphere, to assist school education and promote the prosperity of new Chinese seedlings.</p>
<p>Regarding the theories and practices that should be improved in current children's education, national school teachers have always been mindful of and sought to improve them, so we don't need to repeat them. However, under the current phenomenon of social depression, we hope that the teachers who nurture children will pay special attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, provide more bright suggestions. The turmoil in today's world situation and national affairs affects people's hearts, destructive propaganda and conspiracies enter the cracks, and most young people are almost trapped in a state of confusion, losing confidence in the country and society. This unhealthy mentality must not be allowed to touch children, which is a solemn responsibility of elementary school teachers. We believe that the pure and young minds are always facing the light, as long as their admired teachers can avoid overemphasizing the dark side of society, avoid expressing subjective complaints to innocent children, and often provide positive suggestions for confidence in the future of the country, we believe that the effect of stabilizing society and changing the atmosphere is extremely great.</p>
<p>Secondly, we believe that future children's education must focus on the training of willpower: in recent years, the theories and methods in national education have paid the most attention to arousing "motivation" and cultivating "interest," etc. The education of moral character is also maintained in elementary schools, but we should feel that what young people lack most today is willpower, which must be cultivated at the children's stage. Habits such as enduring hardship and hard work, the spirit of hard work and accomplishment, lasting perseverance and perseverance, are especially needed for self-reliance and establishing oneself in Chinese society. Teachers should provide more stories of self-reliance, proving the truth that man can conquer nature.</p>
<p>Third, devote efforts to the demonstration of personal example: in the group of children whose wisdom has not yet been opened, we must of course explain, set examples and transform them, but the effect of personal example is most effective in elementary schools, because children are sincere and full of imitation. Virtues such as etiquette, cleanliness, law-abiding, and thrift are more effective than repeated instructions if they are practiced and acted upon as a personal example. Teachers who love public property and take responsibility are the most powerful example of cultivating children's public morality and sense of responsibility; maintaining genuine compassion in schools and families is the starting point for social trust and mutual assistance. In today's society of moral disappointment, the turning of good and evil in the minds of elementary school teachers is truly too great in relation to social atmosphere and the future of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, for the parents who raise children, their mission is also sacred, as they sacrifice personal labor and happiness to devote their efforts to the upbringing and education of their children. However, we hope that they will not be obsessed with making money to expect their successors, but should also think from the perspective of the country's future, and should reveal to their children and young generations the light of humanity, pay attention to tempering their will to assist the growth of their knowledge and abilities, and especially not ignore the exemplary role of their own words and deeds, so that they can assist teachers and achieve greater educational results.</p>
<p>Finally, in today's situation where the suppression of the rebellion has not yet ended, we are deeply concerned about the children in the war zones who are displaced, out of school, and without support; the number of these seedlings who have suffered ruthless destruction is quite large, and their need for relief is urgent. We would like to call on the wealthy in society to generously donate to this aspect of relief, and we sincerely hope that the government, in addition to regular national education, will do its best to plan for the accommodation and education of refugee children. Children are jointly owned by parents and the country, so the government must also assume this responsibility of protecting seedlings during the suppression of the rebellion.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai Arrives in Shanghai from Japan: Says a World War Will Not Occur Again in One or Two Years; Discusses US Aid and Believes Self-Reliance is Necessary</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 1:40 PM via Northwest Airlines flight from Tokyo. When speaking to reporters about US aid, Mr. Zhang believed that as long as we are self-reliant, we don't have to worry about others not helping us; otherwise, even with foreign aid, it will not help. No matter who will be in charge of US aid to China in the future, it is not important because the use of the loan has already been stipulated. In terms of the general world situation, although a major war is unlikely to occur again in one or two years, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is already very tense, and the mood for war preparation is very high in both the US government and the public. Regarding the current situation in our country, Mr. Zhang believes that it is already very critical and that we must make efforts in politics, military, culture, and other aspects to make us "like a country." He also said: "The current path of effort is, first, to restore peace, and second, to improve people's lives and establish a clean government. Restoring peace does not mean resuming peace talks, but achieving peace through the awareness of all parties. There are ways to fight wars and ways to make peace." When asked by reporters if he intended to run for vice president, Mr. Zhang said: "I have not considered this matter. As for supporting which vice presidential candidate, a decision can only be made after consultation with the party. The principle is to hope to move in the direction of vigor and revitalization." It is reported that Mr. Zhang left the country on December 13 last year, first went to Washington, DC, and then lectured at the University of Washington in Seattle in January this year. In March, he went to Boston, New York, and Washington, DC. In Washington, DC, he met with Marshall, Wedemeyer, and other relevant personnel.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Inspection Group from Five Provinces Issues Written Statement in Taiwan: Will Strengthen Inter-Provincial Agricultural Ties</h3>
<p>[Taipei, Central News Agency, 3rd] The Taiwan Agricultural Inspection Group from five provinces (Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian) has completed its inspection in Taiwan and issued a written statement as follows: "Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan are all important provinces in South China. The weather and geographical advantages are mostly similar, and the economic lifelines are closely related. Director Song, seeing this, specially invited the five provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian to organize a Taiwan Agricultural Inspection Group to study the causes and effects of agricultural progress in Taiwan Province, the system and methods of agricultural construction, so as to learn from them and engage in improving agriculture in various provinces in South China. Since arriving in Taiwan, the group has conducted systematic inspections in various aspects, such as the agricultural promotion system, from the provincial farmers' association to the county farmers' association, to the township farmers' association, to the farmers' families, and even to the farmers, and has conducted in-depth research. We deeply feel that the various aspects of agriculture in Taiwan Province are indeed more advanced than those in various provinces in South China, and are worthy of learning from. At the same time, we hope that Taiwan Province will take this foundation as a basis and go further to lay the foundation for agricultural construction in various provinces in South China. Secondly, in addition to inspection, the mission of this group is to strengthen the ties between various provinces in South China and Taiwan Province, hoping that the excellent seeds, fertilizers, agricultural machinery, etc. of various provinces can be exchanged with each other, so that the agriculture of South China can have considerable progress. The group has now drafted measures for the exchange of excellent agricultural materials between Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan provinces, and will implement them as soon as both parties agree."</p>

<h3>Hunan Restricts Grain Outflow: Provincial Government Cables Central Government for Explanation</h3>
<p>[Changsha, this newspaper, 3rd] The Hunan Provincial Grain Regulation Committee previously politely declined the requests from the Guangzhou Headquarters, Northeast, Shantou, and other places to purchase grain in Hunan. However, the Executive Yuan disagreed with the principle of Hunan's restriction on grain outflow and cabled the Hunan Provincial Government to cancel it. Recently, the Provincial Government cabled a reply to the Central Government, stating that Hunan suffered disasters in 59 counties last year, and at the same time, too much grain flowed out after the autumn harvest. Now the military grain quota is also large, so in order to avoid famine, it is necessary to take export control measures before the military grain is fully met.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants from Shantou Purchase Grain in Hainan: People of Hainan Petition to Stop It</h3>
<p>[Haikou, this newspaper, 3rd] The Guangdong Provincial Government previously approved grain merchants from Shantou to purchase and transport 800 shi of grain in the grain-producing areas of Hainan due to the grain shortage in Shantou. It is heard that they will purchase another 2,000 to 3,000 shi. The people of Hainan believe that Hainan Island has always been a grain-deficient area. Although there was a bumper harvest last year, the production and sales comparison is still insufficient, and the weather this spring is out of order and a drought has already formed. They all believe that if Shantou merchants come again, it will affect people's food, and they have decided to petition for a stop. In addition, the Headquarters has strictly prohibited the export of grain. If any smugglers are caught, they will be sent to the Northeast to serve as coolies.</p>

<h3>Machinery from Guangzhou Paper Mill Moved to Hokkaido by Japanese</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, Central News Agency, 2nd] A representative sent to Japan by the Guangzhou Paper Mill announced today: The machinery moved from the paper mill to the Hokkaido Paper Mill by the Japanese during the war has now been severely damaged. After ending their three-week inspection in Hokkaido, the representatives said: They can easily provide evidence that 70% of the machinery in the Hokkaido Paper Mill was looted from the Guangzhou Paper Mill. The Guangzhou Paper Mill was the largest paper mill in China, producing 50 tons of paper per day before the war, but it was completely dismantled by the Japanese during the war. The Hokkaido Paper Mill is still continuing to operate, producing 32 tons of paper per day with 400 workers. The representatives added: 30% of the machinery in the Hokkaido Paper Mill is of unknown origin or was moved from the Guangzhou Paper Mill and modified. The machinery has been used arbitrarily by the Japanese, and a large portion of the abandoned machinery has corroded because the Japanese do not know how to use it. The remaining supplementary inferior machinery was manufactured by the Japanese. They are now preparing to submit a report to our delegation in Japan on compensation and return.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] More than 10,000 tons of pig iron will soon be shipped from Hainan Island to Yawata by two Chinese ships.

The ships "Changli" and "Haixu" will carry back compensation materials on their return voyage.

<h3>The Mystery of the Assassination of Guo Xiaoliu, National Assembly Representative from Hanshan</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Express News, 1st] Three days before the National Assembly began its registration, on a dark night with lingering spring rain, Guo Xiaoliu, the National Assembly representative from Hanshan, was assassinated and killed! As of now, the murderer has not been caught, and the case remains a mystery. The Hanshan County Government is offering a reward of 20 million to apprehend the murderer and uncover the truth.</p>
<p>No Permanent Property, Thrifty by Nature</p>
<p>Guo Xiaoliu was from a family in Yuncang Town, Hanshan, with no permanent property and was thrifty by nature. After graduating from the Provincial First Normal School in his early years, he entered society to serve, and life forced him to be self-reliant. As the years flowed by, his status in society gradually rose. He held a series of positions, becoming a member of the county party headquarters, a clerk and section chief in the county government, the leader of the Zhejiang Provincial Government's Political Work Team, and a section chief in the Zhejiang Special Public Security Office. In the complex personnel relationships in the region, he became a leader, either visibly or invisibly, for some. After the victory, he leaped to become a provincial senator. Last year, he participated in the National Assembly election and won the most votes. Naturally, this was the height of his success.</p>
<p>Although the Environment is Bad, He Knows It is Difficult but Does Not Retreat</p>
<p>As a result of his superior position, local matters large and small naturally passed through his hands, and many subtle problems arose. Some were deeply grateful to him, while others inevitably harbored irreconcilable animosity. Last year, when he attended three general assemblies of the Provincial Senate, by chance he spoke with reporters about the situation in Hanshan and sighed, "The local situation in Wo is really too difficult, but I will never retreat even knowing the difficulties." He also said: Although the environment is not simple, but once he retreated everything would be over. He would continue, not to the point of being killed. He was confident that the evil forces in the area had not deteriorated to that extent. Judging from his short stature and simple appearance, it is hard to believe that he was such a resolute and courageous figure. He worked stubbornly until this unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>Gunshots in the Middle of the Night, Calamity Strikes</p>
<p>His self-confidence was indeed strong! In his actions, he never guarded against anyone assassinating him. He would go out alone at night and return home as usual. The doors of his house were open for anyone to enter and exit, and his lifestyle was no different from that of ordinary people. He almost never thought that he would be assassinated, although some friends had advised him that his actions should not be so casual. Finally, this terrible scene fell upon him. It was late on the night of March 15th, in a room on the left side of the second courtyard of the Zhang family's house on Hanshan Nanmen Main Street. As usual, many guests gathered to chat (some say they were playing 麻將), and the host was Guo Xiaoliu. Wind and rain came together, but no one knew that tonight someone would die from a single blow. It was already after 11 o'clock, and the host and guests were still in high spirits. Guo Xiaoliu walked out of the room into the courtyard and there was only the sound of a "bang," and he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The Guard Retreated, the Murderer Escaped</p>
<p>His bodyguard, He Chengen, rushed out and saw a man wearing a blue robe and a top hat in the dim light running towards the front door. When he chased to the gate, he saw three more figures. He Chengen followed closely, but those three people turned into the county dormitory alley. The bodyguard suddenly remembered that he was unarmed. Continuing the pursuit would only put himself at a disadvantage, so he returned to his residence. At this time, Guo Xiaoliu was already in critical condition because the bullet entered from his buttocks and exited from his abdomen. The guests rushed to call a doctor for treatment, but finally died at eight o'clock the next morning. This influential figure from Hanshan ended his life in this way, at the age of only forty-three.</p>
<p>Suspects Apprehended, Strictly Interrogated</p>
<p>After the incident, the police bureau mobilized to search for the murderer. In the home of Tang Wenji, a resident of Wangjia Alley near the county dormitory alley, three major suspects, Luo Pin, Ling Changru, and Suan Yaodong, were captured. As of now, no evidence of the murderer has been found. Another person, Ling Guoying, was arrested on the 17th. At present, these people are still suspects. The Hanshan County Government is offering a reward to apprehend the murderer and is conducting a strict interrogation. The investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>The Mystery of Guo Xiaoliu's Death</p>
<p>Guo Xiaoliu's death has been half a month. Regarding the cause of his death, according to the reporter's investigation, there are two theories: one is that he was too successful in Hanshan during his lifetime and enjoyed too much glory, which led to jealousy. The other is that he was assassinated because of the competition for the National Assembly. It is still too early to draw a conclusion. The truth will be revealed when the real murderer is apprehended. (Our Reporter, Bai Ping)</p>

<h3>Before the Allied Powers Sign a Peace Treaty with Japan, Japan will Restore Administrative Freedom. The System of Issuing Directives to Japan May Gradually Be Eliminated. Kennan Report Praises MacArthur's Policies</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] A Central News Agency reporter has learned from well-informed sources in Tokyo that the Japanese government may soon begin to regain its administrative freedom. The system of Allied control over Japan through the issuance of directives may therefore be gradually eliminated. According to this plan, the Japanese government will regain full freedom in certain areas to decide on policies and actions. The Allied military government departments that have been controlling administrative affairs will be abolished, and the scope of independent action will gradually expand until the Japanese government ultimately regains full control over all ordinary administration and the Japanese government essentially returns to being a fully sovereign state. In this regard, MacArthur's letter to the House Appropriations Committee on January 18 of this year, requesting that Japan be "allowed to regain freedom of action in resolving its own internal affairs and defending its own welfare, in general," is being gradually implemented. The system of directives has already been implemented in Italy. It is generally believed that after MacArthur leaves Japan for the United States, some purely domestic and peacetime tasks of the Japanese government may gradually cease to be subject to Allied control. So far, MacArthur has not indicated that he will return to the United States soon, but general indications suggest that he will leave Japan in mid-May. Other officials of the government group are also rumored to be planning to leave Japan and return home. The government group has ordered the Japanese Central Purge Committee to prepare to end its work, which is significant. The Japanese Diet's Committee to Investigate Illegal Disposal of Government Property (which is one of the most powerful political committees established under the Allied occupation) has been ordered to complete its investigation by April 20. It is rumored that the censorship of Japanese newspapers will also be abolished by the end of this month. These developments indicate that some preparations have been completed to allow certain aspects of Japanese politics to no longer be subject to Allied control. The elimination of the directive system may not mean that the Allied Powers will abandon all efforts to supervise Japan's development, but it will be a concrete step towards Japan regaining its national sovereignty before the peace treaty is signed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press] According to well-informed sources, George Kennan, a senior policy planner who recently returned from an inspection tour of the Far East, has submitted his report to Secretary of State George Marshall. The report deeply praises MacArthur's policies in governing Japan and strongly supports MacArthur's proposed political and economic policies for Japan in the future. Well-informed sources said that Kennan's trip was primarily to personally witness the situation in the Far East, as he had never been to the region before. Although his report to Marshall outlines the policies that the United States should adopt in the Far East, it will significantly influence Marshall. Kennan expressed his strong agreement with MacArthur's view that if the Allied Powers cannot agree on the procedures for convening a peace conference with Japan, the United States must take unilateral action to establish Japan's economy to the point of self-sufficiency and resist communist infiltration. Kennan also agreed that in the face of the generally deteriorating global relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, the military value of Japan as a bulwark against communism should be considered. After a brief meeting with members of the Far East Economic Delegation led by the U.S. Army's Undersecretary Draper, Kennan also agreed with their view that further reparations from Japan should be stopped immediately and that greater efforts should be made to raise Japan's industrial level. As to the question of how far Japan's industry should be developed, it is not yet known whether Kennan agrees with extremists in the U.S. Army Department such as Draper. It is understood that Kennan advocates a more cautious approach to the issue of lifting all controls on Japan. Well-informed sources pointed out that Draper's delegation expressed their views on this issue as businessmen, while Kennan is a planner for the overall plan, so he has to take a cautious attitude for safety.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Announces Withdrawal from Six Allied Control Committees, Situation in Berlin Remains Tense, New Soviet Measures Have a Demonstrative Nature</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Less than 48 hours after implementing stricter control over traffic between the Soviet and Western zones, the Soviet Union announced that it will no longer participate in the six committees under the Berlin Four-Power Joint Headquarters, including transportation, public welfare, property control, de-Nazification, and economy. This decision by the Soviet Union was announced at a meeting of the Four-Power Deputy Commanders in Berlin. The three Western representatives protested the Soviet Union's intention, arguing that these six committees are an integral part of the Berlin Four-Power Headquarters and cannot be abolished. The Soviet representative replied that the Soviet side does not have enough personnel to participate in these committees.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The tense relations between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union in Berlin have been further aggravated by several new developments: (1) the Soviet Union's announcement that it will no longer participate in the six committees of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Headquarters; (2) the increase in Soviet troops in various border areas in the past 24 hours. At the same time, British Commander-in-Chief Robertson, U.S. Commander-in-Chief Clay, and French Commander-in-Chief Koenig have reiterated that the three powers will not withdraw from Berlin. German Social Democratic Party leader Schumacher delivered a speech to the German people, expressing his belief that the Western Allies will not withdraw from Berlin, not only to protect the German people, but also for their own reputation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] British Deputy Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Major General Brian Robertson, said that he believed the Soviet Union's traffic control rules were intended to make it impossible for the Western Allies to maintain their position in Berlin and to show the German people that the Soviet Union has more power than the Western countries, but the Western Allies are also unwilling to show weakness. We believe that the Soviet Union's decision to take these demonstrative actions at this time is also related to the Italian elections. Robertson continued that foreign newspapers have over-publicized this matter, leading people to believe that the major powers in Germany are preparing for war, but in fact, the Soviet Union's new rules only require travelers to show passes and do not prevent travelers with passes from passing through.</p>
<h3>American Military Police Blockade Soviet Railway Administration in Berlin, Freight Transport Still Unimpeded</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] The U.S. military command announced today that it deployed 50 soldiers last night to temporarily blockade the Soviet Railway Administration in the American sector of Berlin. Twenty-two Soviet personnel arrived at the office at 9 AM this morning and were unable to enter. During the blockade, a U.S. officer led six soldiers and several German police officers to guard the area and inspect all pedestrians and vehicles.

<h3>General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>Copyright by Cripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance</p>
<p>Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>(8) Lack of Broad and Deep Vision</p>
<p>With the help of the smart and friendly United States, China could have embarked on the path of strong, stable and self-improving after the war, even when we were fighting side by side with her against Japan.</p>
<p>But this opportunity slipped away between negligent and clumsy fingers. One half of Asia, the center of the world's military strategy, has finally become a place for the struggle for status and power, and since we defeated Japan, we have been retreating and the Soviet Union has been gaining the upper hand.</p>
<p>In 1942, or even later, China's situation was very suitable for us to make long-term investments to promote world peace and progress. The amount of investment may be small, and in any case, it will not be more than the investment that we should make even without such a good hope of return. In addition to material assistance, the investment required is nothing more than the development of a glorious relationship in terms of ideas with an ally whose inclination towards us has been very obvious.</p>
<p>But although this is an easier and more beneficial path, it requires considerable breadth and depth of vision to discover it and follow it, but those in our country who are promoting the policy towards China are blind.</p>
<p>When helping China to fight, we can use our mediation power to promote the self-improvement of the Chinese government, without trying to split her government. We can induce the Chinese armed forces to implement the necessary reforms without trying to take over their command. We can cultivate the peaceful transformation of Chinese communists without strengthening their demands and expanding their ambitions. In every aspect, we have gone the wrong way, abandoning the first method and approving the second method. Or, when we tried the first method, we also tried the second method at the same time, causing our efforts to be futile.</p>
<p>Since Japan began its offensive in 1937, China has become increasingly dependent on U.S. assistance. Since the Pearl Harbor incident in 1941, her hope of survival has been completely pinned on the help of the United States, and her military destiny has been merged with ours. Under such circumstances, there is our greatest opportunity.</p>
<p>Before Japan launched its conquest of China, although the young Republic of China had made great strides forward, there was still a force of resistance to Western ideas and government and public welfare concepts within the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>If our power in China is used accurately, we can reduce the power of the reactionary elements of the Kuomintang and promote the status of the more liberal elements within the party. This step is very simple in nature. There is a natural tendency in the central government to entrust its relationship with the United States to those who speak our language, whether literally or figuratively. This makes the Chinese who have studied abroad generally support the modernization and liberalization of Chinese culture. We only need to be able to use this existing advantage in our relationship with the Chinese.</p>
<p>But there is a prerequisite, that is, we must treat the Chinese on the basis of equality and mutual trust. If Americans treat the Chinese on the other side with suspicion and different identities, it will not work. Even if they get along well in the lower levels but lack friendliness in the higher levels, there will be no good results.</p>
<p>The Americans responsible for our military and diplomatic policy can usually choose a smooth road, which is to establish a beneficial and lasting American force through the liberal and progressive elements of China, from President Chiang down, but they take the path of suspicion and pretentiousness. Sometimes our official attitude, as expressed by the war zone command, is simply close to insult and open hostility—not only to liberals, but to the entire Chongqing government as well.</p>
<p>If, through our encouragement, the progressive elements can show that they can handle relations with the United States, then they may occupy a prominent position in the entire Kuomintang. Therefore, the central government and China will be strengthened, and it is very likely—though not necessarily—that the Chinese Communist Party may leave their Marxist leaders, and the whole country has been united before the Soviet Union can use the Chinese Communist Party as a pawn for her post-war expansion.</p>
<p>In any case, strengthening China by strengthening the Chinese government can restrain any major attempts by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Most of this reasoning belongs to the category of "it may be so," but I believe it shows the lack of ideals in the application of our wartime aid to China policy.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Road Car Accident: Seven Casualties; Zhejiang Alternate Senator Killed; Da Cheng Silk Factory Car Crashes onto Sidewalk in Tragedy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 4:10 PM yesterday on the bustling Nanjing Road, a tragic accident occurred when a car crashed onto the sidewalk, resulting in seven casualties. Jin Jinbai, an alternate senator from Zhejiang Province, was crushed to death on the spot. The car involved in the accident was a blue Shunfeng brand new car with license plate number 53921, owned by Song Baolin, the owner of the Huocheng Silk Weaving Factory at 190 Anyuan Road. Before the accident, the car was borrowed by a Mr. Song Yougao to go to the Leyuan Funeral Parlor on Daxilu Road. After leaving Leyuan, the driver Yang Songyuan drove the empty car, intending to return to the factory's distribution office at 266 Beijing East Road. While passing the Lizhi Pharmacy entrance on Nanjing East Road, the road was slippery due to rain. In order to avoid a rickshaw too quickly, the car crashed onto the sidewalk, first smashing the glass display window of the Wang Xingchang Western Clothing Store. At that time, Jin Jinbai from Wenling, along with his cousin Jin Zhenduo, and his son Jin Chiheng, had just finished dining at the Xinya Restaurant and were about to go to the Grand Theater to see the Emerald Valley movie. They were all knocked to the ground. Because the car was still sliding, Jin Jinbai was dragged to the entrance of the Pinzhenzhubao Store, his forehead shaved off, the back of his head flattened, and his brains splattered everywhere, a terrible sight. He died on the spot. Jin Zhenduo and Jin Chiheng only suffered scratches on their left legs and scalps.</p>
<p>In addition, four passersby, Gao Jinwan, Gao Jinlan, Tang Rongqing, and Zhou Zhao'ayu, were also injured. Gao Jinwan's abdomen was cut open, and she suffered a concussion. She was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment but died due to her injuries. Gao was only twelve years old and lived at 30 Macau Road. Gao Jinlan was her older sister. Both were students. Gao Jinlan only suffered a laceration on her forehead after being hit.</p>
<p>According to investigations after the fact, Jin Jinbai was currently a senator of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, and an alternate senator of the province, 49 years old. In June or July of last year, he moved his wife, one son, and two daughters to Shanghai from Wenling, living at Room 206, Meirong Apartment, 106 Minhang Road. Yesterday morning, his cousin Jin Hongda arrived in Shanghai from his hometown. Jin specially invited his cousins Jin Daichui and Jin Zhenduo, and his son Jin Chiheng, who were in Shanghai, to host a banquet at his residence to welcome Jin Hongda and purchased five movie tickets for the second show at the Grand Theater. Because it was still early, they went to Xinya for a short break. During the break, they decided to have dinner at the Huibinlou Restaurant in the evening. After leaving Xinya, Jin Hongda and Jin Yuanchui walked faster, while Jin Jinbai, Jin Zhenduo, and Jin Chiheng walked slowly side by side, not far apart. Unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred in a short time. Of the five people, one died and two were injured, while the other two were fortunately unharmed. Jin Jinbai's family has hired a lawyer and decided to file a lawsuit with the court to investigate the responsibility for the accident.</p>
<p>Among the injured, Tang Rongqing, from Shaoxing, was a tea servant at a certain stock exchange. He suffered a laceration on his forehead. Zhou Zhao'ayu had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown of Wenzhou yesterday to visit her niece, who worked as a maid at Wang Xingchang. She was asking questions at the entrance when she was hit, suffering a broken left leg. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment and are no longer in serious condition. After the accident, the Lao Zha police station meticulously measured the car's speed and proved that the car's speed at the time was only 15 yards. According to the driver, the main reason for the accident was that the road was too slippery, the swerving was too sudden, and the brakes could not be controlled. Driver Yang Songyuan was detained and attempted suicide several times, but was unsuccessful due to the close supervision of the police station.</p>

<h3>Prices of Chinese and Western Cuisine Set Meals to Be Adjusted Automatically Every Month; Thrift Movement Committee Passed Regulations Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai All Circles Thrift Movement Committee held its fifth meeting at the City Hall meeting room at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the price adjustment standards for the Chinese and Western cuisine industries. The Shanghai Western Cuisine, Coffee, and Liquor Industry Association previously requested that the approved prices for frugal banquets and set meals were no longer suitable, and requested that the average price of several main ingredients such as chicken, duck, fish, shrimp for Chinese banquets, and chicken, fish, and meat for Western cuisine be used as the basis for adjusting prices for frugal banquets in the future. The price of Chinese and Western set meals should be automatically adjusted based on rice prices. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the case as follows: (1) The highest price for a Chinese banquet is 3 million yuan per table, decreasing by 200,000 yuan per level, with at least ten levels. (2) The highest price for a Chinese and Western economy set meal is 60,000 yuan per meal, decreasing by 5,000 yuan per level, with at least six levels. The case was passed by the Municipal Affairs Conference, allowing the respective associations to adjust on their own, but must follow the following adjustment standards to show restrictions: (1) The average price of five main ingredients such as chicken, duck, fish, shrimp, and pork is the adjustment standard for Chinese cuisine. (2) The average price of three main ingredients such as chicken, fish, and pork is the adjustment standard for Western cuisine. (3) Chinese and Western economy set meals are adjusted based on rice prices. At yesterday's meeting, the committee members put forward many opinions on the method of automatic adjustment of the liquor and cuisine industry, and decided that the price should be adjusted automatically once a month, and the average price of the main ingredients and rice prices such as chicken, duck, fish, shrimp, and pork in the last ten days of each month should be the adjustment standard. The Chinese and Western cuisine industries should calculate the price at the end of the month and submit it to the City Social Affairs Bureau for approval and implementation. However, if the rise and fall of the main ingredient prices and rice prices are less than one-tenth, no adjustment should be made.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Black Market Firms; More Than a Dozen Suspected</h3>

<h3>Xu Jizhuang on Trial in Hong Kong; Attacked by British Lawyer</h3>
<p>Xi Bingxi Reported the Process to the District Court</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Xu Jizhuang, the former Director of the Postal Remittance Bureau, who was accused of corruption, is currently on trial in the Hong Kong court. The original evidence of the relevant witnesses has been presented, and the British Royal Lawyer has launched a fierce attack on Xu. However, because there is too much evidence, it needs to be reviewed one by one. As a result, the hearing was postponed to the 15th to 18th of this month. Lawyer Xi Bingxi reported the details of the Xu case hearing to the Municipal District Court yesterday. It is reported that Xu once requested the Hong Kong court to be transferred from Stanley Prison to another prison, but it was not approved. Also, at the opening of the court on the 1st of this month, a senior official of the Postal Remittance Bureau testified that Xu had committed illegal crimes. According to the regulations of the Postal Remittance Bureau, the director has the right to approve remittances within 50 million, but those exceeding 50 million yuan must be decided by a joint meeting of the bureau. The huge remittances of Peng Bingcheng, Kong Guangxiao, etc. were all decided by Xu unilaterally, and the collusion and malpractice in between are very obvious.</p>
<h3>Cohabitation Leads to Suspicion, Accusation of Gold Bar Theft</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Fuchang, Assistant Manager of the Business Department of the Financial Daily, has recently been accused by Ms. Li Min, a Guangdong woman, of stealing gold bars. The case was investigated by Inspector Liang yesterday. It is reported that Wang resided at No. 83 Yong'an Lane, Sichuan Road. On December 10th last year, Li Min moved into the second floor of the house through the introduction of a friend, Miao Jianqing. Because Wang and Li often met, their relationship gradually became close. Later, Wang and Li had a falling out over trivial matters, and Ms. Li moved out on January 25th of this year, temporarily residing at the Dongya Hotel. When opening her luggage, she discovered that seven gold bars were missing, and suspected that Wang had stolen them. After several unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, she filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. Both Wang and Li appeared in court yesterday. Wang presented evidence to the contrary, denying the theft. Inspector Liang instructed both parties to first attempt to reconcile outside of court. If reconciliation fails, the court will reopen the case for trial.</p>

<h3>Wusong Murder Case Solved, Five Principals and Accomplices Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the morning of the 27th of last month, a male corpse dressed in military uniform was discovered in a riverbank near Taixing Road in Wusong Town. The principal offender, Sun Faju, was arrested the day before yesterday, along with several accomplices. The deceased was Zhou Mingsheng from Xuzhou, 42 years old, formerly employed in the artillery regiment of the 88th Division, and currently a cook in the 4th Regiment of the Air Force Anti-Aircraft Artillery. Several months ago, he met Sun Faju (32 years old from Suqian), who ran a small general store at Zhang Huabangkou on Jungong Road. Zhou deposited over 3 million yuan in cash with Sun's store to earn interest, accumulating over 10 million yuan in principal and interest. Later, due to frequent interactions, he engaged in illicit relations with Sun's wife, Ms. Zhang. Sun became aware of this and harbored resentment, leading to a desire to kill Zhou.</p>
<p>At the same time, two other soldiers, Zhou Naijiao and Zhu Shaoquan, coveted Zhou's wealth and, knowing that he wanted to marry a wife, conspired with Sun. Under the pretext of arranging a matchmaking, Sun and the others lured Zhou Mingsheng to a mountainside near Taixing Road at 8:00 PM on the 25th. Taking him by surprise, they struck him on the head with a club, then stabbed him seven or eight times in the head and face with a knife. Zhou died on the spot due to severe injuries. The murderers robbed him of his gold ring and other belongings, then abandoned his body in the riverbank and dispersed. Later, Zhou Mingsheng's original unit, upon discovering his tragic death, suspected Sun Faju and his wife, Ms. Zhang, and handed them over to the police station for investigation. After questioning, they confessed without hesitation. The police station also successively apprehended the accomplices Wu Genbiao, Qin Huangsi, Zhu Shaoquan, and Zhou Naijiao. Because Zhu and Zhou are both active-duty soldiers, they were returned to their unit for investigation. The remaining suspects confessed to jointly plotting to kill for money without hesitation and will be sent to the District Procuratorate for punishment.</p>

<h3>Renault Flew to Nanjing Yesterday Morning, Admitted to Impropriety to Our Side, Suggested a Re-Exploration</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Renault admitted to a twelve-member committee of the Central Research Institute in Nanjing on the 3rd that he was guilty of "impropriety and lack of consideration" toward the Chinese organizers in the aborted exploration of Mount Jishi. The institute also obtained a public guarantee from Renault that the "Explorer" jumbo plane would not leave China until the Chinese members of the expedition team returned to Nanjing and all matters were settled. The committee also requested Renault to issue a statement stating that the Chinese team members had done their best to assist the expedition. After Renault agreed, the committee agreed to remove one of the armed guards stationed at the airport. Renault counter-proposed that once the plane was repaired, he would proceed with the exploration of Mount Jishi. Committee Chairman Sa Bendong replied that the committee could not answer until it had consulted with the team members.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After Renault's exploration plane returned from India the night before last, Renault himself took a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Beijing yesterday morning. His exploration plane is parked at Longhua Airport, guarded by airport authorities, and will not be allowed to leave China until the procedures have been completed.</p>
<p>Renault's exploration plane flew back to Shanghai from Ping the afternoon of the 1st. At 6:06 AM on the morning of the 2nd, it left Shanghai without notice. After being missing for thirteen hours, it returned to Shanghai at 6:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. According to Renault, he suddenly discovered that his passport visa had expired while flying to Calcutta, so he turned back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Renault's pilot, Oaf, yesterday, his departure from Shanghai this time was not sudden because he was eager to return to his country. He then said that the cancellation of the exploration was a secondary reason for the repeated failures of the plane. The main reason was that people had lost faith and no one wanted to risk their lives to board the plane, so Renault did not want to waste money unnecessarily and did not want the exploration to continue.</p>
<p>When asked why he left Shanghai without permission, Auden replied that he had obtained permission from the Air Traffic Control Tower of the Civil Aviation Administration when he flew out of Shanghai at two in the morning. They planned to return home via Europe because Renault did not want to make a long-distance flight over the Pacific Ocean. By taking the European route, they could land at any time, and they could also take the opportunity to go to Paris because Renault had matters to attend to there. Therefore, they flew directly to Calcutta after leaving Shanghai. Later, they discovered that their passport visa had expired in the middle of the trip, so they turned back and re-planned to return home via the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The exploration plane suddenly left Shanghai without permission from the Civil Aviation Administration</p>
<p>However, according to Lin Zuxin, director of the Longhua Airport of the Civil Aviation Administration, Renault's sudden departure from Shanghai this time did not complete the necessary procedures. Therefore, after receiving a telegram from Beijing, he sent a telegram urging the plane to return to Shanghai, but did not receive a reply. In fact, the plane lost contact with the ground after taking off, and it was not known whether it was going to Calcutta. According to international civil aviation regulations, Renault's exploration plane needs to obtain permission from the Civil Aviation Administration when leaving Shanghai, but Renault only received flight permission from the control tower and took off on his own, which is illegal. The control tower is only responsible for technical issues such as weather for air travel. Moreover, when Renault came to China, he obtained a permit from the Civil Aviation Administration to fly within China. He did not return it when he suddenly left Shanghai the day before yesterday. Therefore, Renault needs to complete all the procedures before he can leave Shanghai.</p>
<p>After Renault returned to Shanghai, he tried to contact Director Lin by phone, but could not get through. Yesterday morning, Dinuo sent co-pilot Sari to the Aviation Station of the Civil Aviation Administration to inquire about the procedures.</p>
<p>Also, according to Chen Difan, director of the Shanghai office of the Central Research Institute, Renault contacted the American authorities in Nanjing yesterday morning after flying to Beijing, and then met with Sa Bendong and others in the afternoon. Renault said when he was in Shanghai that he would suggest in Beijing that the exploration should continue, with all scientific personnel being Chinese.</p>
<p>Washburn Expressed Disappointment at the Sudden End of the Exploration</p>
<p>Washburn, scientific advisor to the Mount Jishi exploration team, issued a statement yesterday regarding Renault's departure without notice and cancellation of the exploration:</p>
<p>"The American scientific personnel of the Mount Jishi exploration team are unaware of Renault's actions after he flew away from Beiping two days ago. Renault announced the official end of the exploration on the evening of March 30th, and told me to meet him in Shanghai the next day. When I arrived at Longhua Airport on a China National Aviation Corporation flight last night, I learned that Renault and his party had flown to Calcutta in the morning. Three hours later, I learned that he had left a message with a friend, asking me to call Dr. Sa Bendong of the Central Research Institute to inform him that he was leaving China in a hurry, which was very regrettable.</p>
<p>"I have not yet connected to the long-distance call to Nanjing. A reporter told me that Renault's plane returned to Shanghai thirteen hours after flying to Calcutta. After Renault returned to Shanghai, the scientific personnel of the exploration team did not meet him. Apart from the news published in the newspaper, I know nothing about the details.</p>
<p>"We are very disappointed by the sudden end of this exploration, which was prepared by Chinese and American scientific personnel for several months. We are very grateful for the welcome given by Chinese scientists and people. Chinese and American scientific personnel have been very harmonious on all aspects of the exploration. If Dr. Sa Bendong believes that I can assist in ending the exploration, I intend to stay here and do my best to assist."</p>

<h3>Revision of Private Trade Policy with Japan, Executive Yuan Has Decided on Principles</h3>
<p>Private trade with Japan has been ongoing for many days since the private representatives went to Japan, but there are still no results. The biggest reason for this is the lack of materials in Japan, which makes it difficult to complete transactions. It is learned that the government has decided to reconsider its private trade policy with Japan and will revise it separately. The Executive Yuan convened relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Bank, and the Export Control Commission in Beijing on the 1st of this month to discuss this matter. The principles have been decided:</p>
<p>(1) Export materials that have a market in Europe and the United States should be exported to Europe and the United States for sale.</p>
<p>(2) The management of private trade with Japan shall be the responsibility of the Export Control Commission, and the export and import trade shall be certified by the Export Control Commission.</p>
<p>The revision of this policy will not affect trade with Japan, because the Export Control Commission has counted more than 280 types of materials that can be exported to Japan. The purpose of the revision is to seek more foreign exchange, because transactions with Japan are purely on an accounting basis.</p>

<h3>From Children's Day to Child Welfare - Written for the 37th Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Chen Tiesheng</p>
<p>Today is the 17th Children's Day, and there are grand celebrations and commemorations throughout the country. This is an annual gathering, and on this day each year, many dedicated child workers and comrades in childcare services write articles expressing their hopes, ideals, or suggestions for Children's Day, and even making further appeals. However, after each grand gathering passes, it fades away with the spring breeze, and many profound and valuable opinions become merely topical articles, never fulfilling the true meaning of the founding of this grand gathering or the central task of current child rearing issues. We feel deeply ashamed of the uneventful passing of the previous sixteen Children's Days!</p>
<p>Everyone knows the position children occupy in the national sphere: they are the future masters, the creators of culture, and the inheritors of history. They shoulder great responsibilities for the future. But how can we enable this next generation of masters to take on such great tasks? Everyone knows that this is not a responsibility solely for comrades engaged in child welfare work; it requires all adults in the country, as well as parents and teachers, to jointly shoulder this responsibility and cultivate diligently, so that the next generation of citizens can stand strong.</p>
<p>Indeed, children's issues are the root of all social problems. Especially in our troubled China, not only are there issues of children's education in schools and the relief and education of poor children, but there are also irrational habits inherited from feudalism in society, such as the evils of raising child laborers, maids, and child brides. Although sixteen years have passed since the founding of Children's Day and the joint efforts of concerned people across the country, these evils have not been completely eradicated. This is not only a legal responsibility, but also a serious social problem. Furthermore, this is the responsibility of every comrade engaged in child welfare work. We should always draw the attention of society, conduct accurate investigations and statistics, assist the government in correcting customs, and widely publicize through literature and art, so that all adults in the country know that children have independent personalities, and that children do not belong to their parents. We must awaken the awareness of the whole country and make the greatest efforts to ensure that the next generation is healthy, and that our country is strong and its position is elevated.</p>
<p>Based on the above issues, the significance of holding Children's Day each year is not only to gather and celebrate, but to have a common goal, to summarize all children's issues, to conduct systematic research to provide comrades in child welfare work with options, and to jointly promote it with national child welfare organizations. It seems feasible to first try this in Shanghai. From today until the same day next year, we hope to have a permanent memorial produced, such as children's parks, children's sanatoriums, children's cinemas, and children's libraries. We can gather donations from comrades and, depending on financial resources and the environment, choose one to complete on a regular basis. We must not let this great and important gathering only consist of empty celebrations. We hope that comrades in children's welfare organizations throughout the city will pay more attention to this great holiday, work towards our common goals, accomplish the above tasks, and pay more attention to cultivating the next generation. If we can do so, it will not be difficult for China's child welfare cause to embark on a bright path.</p>
<h3>Football League A Division: Eastern vs. Qingbai Final Decisive Battle Today at 3:00 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The two giants of the Chinese Football League A Division, Eastern and Qingbai, will decide the championship today at 3:00 PM at Yiyuan. Tickets are still sold in two types: ordinary 40,000 and special 60,000. Ordinary seats are limited to 15,000, and special seats are limited to 3,000. Presales will begin at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Stadium. The Yiyuan gate will open at 12:00 noon, and spectators must enter the venue before 2:00 PM after verifying their tickets. The referee is Wu Shouheng, and the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui.</p>
<p>In addition to the A Division, there are also the C3 group finals and two youth cup matches, which will be competed at Zhongzheng Park at 10:00 AM. The complete schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai Qing vs. Eastern (A Division Final) 3:00 PM Yiyuan</p>
<p>Qingbai B vs. Zhongfang (Youth Cup) 10:00 AM Zhong 1</p>
<p>Qunli vs. Jingwu (Youth Cup) 10:00 AM Zhong 2</p>
<p>Yin Team vs. Xinfeng (C3 Final) 10:00 AM Zhong 3</p>
<p>The Eastern team is the champion of the previous League A, with strong fighting power. This year, it is even more determined to strengthen itself. In addition to all the veterans, it has recruited three knights from the south, Xie Jinhong, Chen Jiawan, and Xia Tixian, which makes it even better. The lineup for today's game was announced yesterday by Jia Youliang: Jiawan will move to the right, Jinhong will be the left defender, and Lin Gen will replace Yu Qiaoxing. There are no other changes. Xie was best at left back when he was in Hong Kong, but since coming to Shanghai, due to Sun's leg injury and Youliang's retirement, there has been a lack of talent on the front line, so Xie played as an inside forward. Now that he is back in his defensive position, he will be able to play to his full potential. Working with Chen Jiawan, he will definitely be able to "meet head on" with Qingbai's Wu Yan. Lin Gen and Sun Laorong have been away from the game for a long time due to injuries. Now that they are putting on their uniforms again, the strength of both offense and defense has been increased. The rest of the team are also first-class players, well-equipped, and very ideal.</p>
<p>Although Qingbai Qing was the runner-up in the last league, it defeated Eastern in the Mayor's Cup and retained the trophy. The iron gate of defender Wu Yan is well-known and does not need much introduction. Center-back Meng Yiliang is in excellent form, his marking skills are top-notch, Gao Baozheng is steady and reliable, running all over the field, not only can he defend, but he can also assist in the attack. The forwards are led by Afu, who will lead the troops and charge into battle. Goalkeeper Qin Bigao will arrive from Hong Kong this morning, so the team's lineup is also very strong. It is difficult to predict who will win this battle. The lineups of the two teams and the situation in Group A are listed below:</p>
<p>Eastern Team</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong Chen Jiawan</p>
<p>Han Longbo Tan Fuzhen Zhang Linggen</p>
<p>Li Yao Sun Jinshun Han Longhai Xia Tixian Chen Mingzhe</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>Madame Chiang, president of the China Committee of the United Nations Children's Relief Fund, wrote to representatives of the National Assembly, asking them to donate one day's income to relieve the suffering of 300 million children worldwide. Madame Chiang recently received a telegram from a seven-year-old girl named Zhao Huimin in Yueyang, who remitted 100,000 yuan through the China Farmers Bank to support the movement she initiated to solicit funds for children's relief. She was deeply moved by this.</p>
<p>It is estimated that at least 100 million of the 300 million suffering children are in China. On the same day that the above news was published, the Tianjin Min Guo Daily had a dispatch from Kaifeng, describing three tragedies of selling children on the streets of Bianliang on the same day. It said: "Behind Xiangguo Temple Street, a woman dressed in rural clothes, with a wet headscarf and a haggard face, held a baby boy just over eight months old in her arms... With tears in her eyes, she told passersby that she wanted to sell him for five million yuan." "...In a remote and narrow timber mill street, a half-naked middle-aged man stood in the mud, asking for six million yuan as the price for selling his newborn treasure... He was Feng Jin'an, a refugee from Fengqiu. His family of five had been without food for two days, and he had to resort to this last resort." "At about 6 PM on the same afternoon, a woman on Caoshi Street was also selling her four-month-old boy, asking for six million yuan."</p>
<p>Although five or six million yuan is a paltry sum today, it can still sustain people in dire straits for ten days or half a month. In times of famine and upheaval, children are always the first to suffer misfortune, being sold or exchanged for food, which is "a practice that has existed since ancient times." However, the fact that such things still occur in the 20th century, when society has made so much progress in civilization, makes one feel that the world is hopeless.</p>
<p>Adults have never paid attention to the importance of children; even if there is a Children's Day, it is only a day for extravagant praise. If there is a disaster, relief is given to adults first. When I was in Qingdao, I met some poor children, which I can mention here. Once, while having dinner in a restaurant, two shoeshine boys came in. They told me that sometimes they had no business all day. Qingdao is not like Shanghai; there are many shoeshiners, but few people wear boots. Their shoeshine equipment—a simple small wooden box, etc.—was bought for them by American soldiers. The boy said, "It's been two years, used 50 cents in American money." They looked really pitiful. First, at the age of ten or so, they should not be supporting themselves. Second, even when business is good, they cannot eat their fill with what they earn in a day. Education is of course not something they can dream of. Let me tell you, there are many children in Qingdao who do not even have a set of shoeshine equipment, and they beg from American soldiers and respectable merchants all day long. Few people give them anything, and their lives are even worse than those two boys. Every now and then, children around the age of ten or fifteen or sixteen come to the restaurant to sell the day's newspapers and pictorials. They are students. They wear tattered clothes and have a sallow, malnourished face. I often saw this in Shenyang, and it was common in Pingjin as well. I believe there are many more children living in suffering that I have not seen. My heart is heavy, and I don't know how I can help them.</p>
<h3>Chinchilla</h3>
<p>— Dan Gou</p>
<p>You probably don't know much about the life of this adorable little animal, the chinchilla, so I'll give you a brief introduction here. The Andes Mountains of South America, with their icy and snowy conditions, are the richest source of chinchillas. According to local natives, humans began to discover chinchillas and use their fur to make clothes as early as 1524. Over the next four hundred years, the local leather industry gradually flourished, and as a result, chinchillas were almost completely captured. It was not until 1918 that the governments of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia issued orders prohibiting the export of chinchilla fur, so the chinchilla was spared the fate of the dodo (the dodo was a giant bird native to Mauritius Island, now extinct).</p>
<p>Speaking of the life of the chinchilla, perhaps the most interesting thing is its family life. Because the chinchilla's family life is similar to that of humans, the chinchilla actually "proposes marriage" to the female chinchilla. If the "proposal" is successful, they live a "monogamous" family life, but the "proposal" is often rejected.</p>
<p>A pair of chinchillas will produce offspring one year after mating, with each litter containing about one to four young, but usually two. When the baby chinchillas are born, their eyes can open and see things. Their bodies are about the size of a human thumb, and they are extremely lively, running around and rolling on the ground like a small fluffy ball, which is very interesting. At that time, the adult chinchillas run in and out of the nest, extremely busy, taking care of their babies and the mother.</p>
<p>Chinchillas have a very strong reproductive capacity. In five years, a pair of chinchillas can produce as many as thirty to thirty-two pairs of offspring. What is their lifespan? They can usually live up to seven years.</p>
<p>Chinchillas love to eat tender seedlings, alfalfa, and hay, but they eat very little. Each pair of chinchillas eats only about three ounces a day.</p>
<p>According to those engaged in the chinchilla industry, the demand for chinchilla fur has increased sharply in various regions after the war, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Because the fur sold in the pastures is all from old, weak, and disabled chinchillas, it is not enough to meet the demand.</p>
<h3>The Story of Eating for Free</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>It is said that on a certain day in early spring when the weather was sunny, two well-dressed middle-aged gentlemen were sitting in a park outside a magnificent hotel in New York. The one sitting on the left, with a cheerful smile, said to his newly acquainted companion, "This hotel is very well-equipped, isn't it? Today, I would very much like to go to the rooftop garden of the hotel and have a delicious and exquisite meal. However, I'm very sorry to say that I don't have a penny in my pocket!"</p>
<p>The other person said, "That's very strange, I didn't bring any money either." After a while, he continued, "I have come up with a good idea. We are both dressed very elegantly. We might as well go to the rooftop garden, choose the most delicious dishes and fine wines on the menu, and before the waiter asks us for the bill, we can borrow a dime from him and use the coin toss method to decide who can eat for free and who has to stay there to deal with the waiter." The first person praised the idea repeatedly.</p>
<p>They had a very pleasant meal. The food was well-cooked, and they talked and laughed cheerfully during the meal. The dime had been borrowed and placed on the table. At this time, the first person hesitated, wanting to say something but stopping. Finally, he said, "My friend, I am very sorry to you, I have deceived you a little. When I told you in the park that I didn't have a penny on me, that was absolutely true, but please don't worry about this expense, I can send someone to my house to get it. I am very rich. I changed into a new suit this morning and forgot to put my wallet and other small items in my pocket. In fact, if you insist that I tell you the truth, I own the most valuable piece of property here."</p>
<p>The other person laughed loudly and said, "I think we are two of a kind, I should have known you sooner. You may not know, but I am the owner of this hotel."</p>
<h3>Illegitimate Child</h3>
<p>— Mao Yi</p>
<p>Even now, society still looks at illegitimate children with a discriminatory eye. But why should illegitimate children be humiliated? They cannot be held responsible for their own birth.</p>
<p>Illegitimate children have existed since the concept of marriage came into being. Although the attitude towards them has mostly been discriminatory in various eras and regions, there have also been differences. Before the Christian era, the Athenians dealt with illegitimate children by abandoning them in the open air, letting them freeze and starve to death. The Romans had the same contempt for illegitimate children and divided them into two categories: one was the product of lust; the other was the crystallization of love. They gave them special names.</p>
<p>Ancient Germanic law only tolerated illegitimate children whose parents were of equal social class. Other types of illegitimate children were considered illegal.</p>
<p>The French people have always been romantic. In the feudal era, there was no special insult to illegitimate children. They recognized that illegitimate children had the same inheritance rights as legitimate children. Many common people produced by kings who were unfaithful outside, could also obtain titles and privileges in the future; however, there was one limitation, they could not inherit the throne, specifically, the French throne.</p>
<p>In Italy, as early as the sixth century, the Christian Church wanted to establish foundling homes to prevent unmarried parents from abandoning and killing infants. In the twelfth century, Pope Innocent III officially established a foundling home in Rome. Outside the foundling home was a basket. After the baby was placed inside, as long as the bell was rung, a nun would come out and take the abandoned baby away, raising him in place of the irresponsible parents. This method of accepting illegitimate children spread widely, and various parts of Italy and Spain, South America, and Portugal imitated it.</p>
<p>As times progress, the legal protection for illegitimate children is also increasing. However, the snobbish society still discriminates against innocent illegitimate children—this is the result of the prevailing moral concepts.</p>
<h3>On Loving Money</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Normally, talking about loving money sounds very bad; loving money has become a synonym for baseness.</p>
<p>But in reality, why can't money be loved? Eating requires money, dressing requires money, living in a house requires money, traveling requires money, treating illness requires money, entertaining requires money, receiving education requires money, making friends requires money, getting married requires money, having children requires money... What doesn't require money? Where doesn't require money? Those with more money can satisfy more and higher demands in life; those with less money can only satisfy fewer and lower demands; those without money cannot even satisfy the demands of survival, and can only lament in despair. So, isn't it appropriate for people to want money?</p>
<p>Moreover, money itself has a beautiful appearance and is extremely convenient; a mere piece of paper can be worth thousands of gold, so it's no wonder people only fear not having enough money.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of money, corruption, hoarding, robbery, fraud, exploitation, and miserliness become unavoidable.</p>
<p>If people's needs in life did not have to be satisfied with money, then what would be so lovable about money? Who would love it? Therefore, I think, wouldn't it be great if this thing called money were simply abolished in the world! Everyone would not use money; salaries and wages would be paid in kind; commercial transactions would be exchanged for goods. What would be the result? Money would be useless, and physical objects would be cumbersome and inconvenient. What would happen then? Money would no longer be loved, not to mention, even physical objects would definitely not be coveted as much as money is—this is one method.</p>
<p>Another method is: please have scientists invent an extremely sophisticated method to use garbage and soil as raw materials to cast currency. This currency must retain its odor, have a very high specific gravity, be inconvenient to carry, have an ugly shape, and have edges that prick the hand. Of course, it must still be carefully protected against counterfeiting; this may reduce people's interest in money, thereby saving many sins, right?</p>
<p>In a world where life cannot be sustained without money, if you don't follow my method, blaming people for loving money is simply tantamount to murder. Don't you agree?</p>
<h3>Peter the Great's Dream</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>It is said that one day two hundred years ago, the old Russian Peter the Great was walking in the palace when he saw sunlight streaming in from outside the window. He suddenly thought:</p>
<p>"With windows, sunlight and fresh air can flow in. My great empire is so cold and dark because it has no windows. I must open a window for my great empire!"</p>
<p>By "empire window" he meant finding an ice-free port.</p>
<p>So he picked up a map and studied it carefully. His eyes lingered on the western European part, shook his head, and sighed:</p>
<p>"If I want to find an outlet on the Baltic Sea, it's not for me now."</p>
<p>His ancestral line turned to the Asian part, and finally he stared fiercely at Vladivostok - this is a very good eastern outlet.</p>
<p>He couldn't help but laugh triumphantly.</p>
<p>Before he had laughed for long, a shadow came over his face. He gazed sadly at the vast Siberian prairie on the map, and another difficult question arose:</p>
<p>"How can we get to Vladivostok through this endless wilderness?"</p>
<p>He thought for a long time but could not come up with a solution. Finally, he picked up a quill pen in anger and drew a straight blue line on the map - from Moscow to Vladivostok. After finishing drawing, he murmured to himself with a slight anger:</p>
<p>"Let me fly to Vladivostok on this straight line in my dream!"</p>
<p>Years later, Peter the Great died. Officials studying the emperor's posthumous manuscripts found this map and saw this blue line. They studied it collectively for a long time, and finally came to the conclusion: the emperor must have been dreaming of realizing a route that would lead directly to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>"We must not let the emperor's dream be disappointed!" This was the unanimous opinion of the ministers.</p>
<p>So, eighty years later, this straight blue line, casually drawn on the map with a quill pen, finally became two ten thousand-mile steel rails - this is the history of the construction of the Siberian Railway.</p>
<h3>Xu Wenchang's Theory on Imitating Poetry</h3>
<p>— Hong Xian</p>
<p>Poetry originally values novelty, and only having an original style counts as good poetry, but the world reveres imitation, resulting in fewer opportunities for the development of poetry. Occasionally, when rereading the Complete Works of Xu Wenchang, there is a passage in his preface to the poem by Ye Zisu that is devoted to the word "imitation". What he says is particularly humorous. Now I have copied it down for poets' reference:</p>
<p>"Some people learn to speak bird language, their sound is that of a bird, but their nature is that of a person; some birds learn to speak human language, their sound is that of a person, but their nature is that of a bird. Can this be used to determine the balance between people and birds? How is the poet of today different from this? He does not emerge from what he has obtained on his own, but steals what others have already said, saying, 'This poem is of this type, this poem is not'; 'This sentence is like this person, this sentence is not.' Although this is extremely elaborate, it is only a close imitation, and it cannot escape the bird speaking human language!"</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Although coffee is stimulating, drinking it again and again becomes nothing.</p>
<p>A lamp illuminates a dark room; when there is no lamp, a candle also illuminates a dark room.</p>
<p>The silkworm has a belly full of classics.</p>
<p>Fireflies have "luminous tails."</p>
<p>If crows were all female, or did not have the nickname "old crow," perhaps they would not be hated, because they speak without restraint.</p>
<p>Thunder is the means of transportation for the gods.</p>
<h3>Radio Registration "Discretionary Extension"</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: Having read the article "Reporting Political Matters" in today's newspaper, I believe it is a good word for the world and supports the political atmosphere. The Spring and Autumn styles are cautious and respectful. I admire it immensely. The handling of wireless radio registration by this bureau is a regular business matter. This time, we were ordered to expedite matters, and originally planned to end a section by the end of March for statistical purposes. However, as of the end of last month, there are still many households in various places that have not yet registered, so we were ordered to grant a discretionary extension. As of March 31st, this bureau has accepted approximately 25,000 radio registration applications in this city (of which foreign listeners account for only 4 percent). There are still many people who continue to apply. Those who install new radios afterwards can continue to apply for registration. The circumstances and purpose of the radio registration handled by this bureau have been reported in the newspapers. I would also like to ask your column to publish this information. (The rest omitted) Sincerely, Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, April 1, 37th year.</p>
<h3>Seeing the Big in the Small</h3>
<p>— Lei Hong</p>
<p>The fact that we in this era have set a Children's Day is probably because we especially feel that today's children are tomorrow's pillars of the country. If we pay attention to them from the foundation, of course, it will not only be a good way to save the children, but also to "save the country". However, what we should do on Children's Day is not to pick a few white, chubby, pampered children to take some photos, or to let a group of limited children who have been well cared for by their parents go to the cinema to see a movie, which is just perfunctory. We should pay attention to the general children's activity, thinking ability, character, and habits, so that they can develop from childhood to adulthood. Foreign magazines often have columns about children's small actions for parents to see the big in the small. It is not until Children's Day that we pay attention to children's various things. When the festival is approaching, we can also catch up quickly, and I will translate a few children's anecdotes to serve as a starting point.</p>
<p>At lunchtime, five-year-old Julie put down her spoon and said to her mother, "Mom, there's a hair in my soup."</p>
<p>"Shhh, child," the mother said, a little annoyed, "Mom explained, "This is a crack on the bowl."</p>
<p>The child picked up the spoon and stirred for a while. "Mom," she asked, chasing after her, "how can the crack move?"</p>
<p>The father scolded his six-year-old child for telling a big lie. "I never lied at your age," the father said angrily. The child was stunned for a while, then asked, "Dad, so how old were you when you started lying?"</p>
<p>A neighbor's child ran over to ask me, "Mom, is the devil a man?"</p>
<p>I thought, why tell her the connection between the devil and men, so I answered her, "No, the devil is worse than men, worse than who knows how much." She was still a little confused and asked, "Do you mean that the devil is a woman?"</p>
<p>A man watched his nephew and several other boys perform a scramble. So he called his nephew over and said, "Steve, if you can take their fortress in fifteen minutes, I'll give you 25 cents!" Three minutes later, the child ran to his uncle to report the news: the other children in the fort had surrendered.</p>
<p>"Here are 25 cents," the uncle said, "but how did you make them surrender so quickly?"</p>
<p>"I promised the enemy to divide a dime among them, and they surrendered," the child said.</p>
<h3>Reply to Chu Jiansou</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>I received a letter from Mr. Nanqiang saying that although Qingming is near, there are still people carrying spears on Longshan, so it seems that it is not suitable for waxing exhibitions or supporting the cane. The world is so chaotic, even if Su Dongpo were resurrected in Jiuyuan, I am afraid he would not write about living in Yangxian.</p>
<p>The West Jiu reed grows in the spring water, the lush Longcao separates the carts and dust, the apricot flowers are red and wet with rain between soldiers, the sky is far and the cave is deep, I miss the old man!</p>
<p>The fields and gardens are clear and strange by the valley, I report the letter after illness, and my wrist strength is weak, the garlic and chives are bleak and yellow, and the pine is gloomy and green. I am utterly sad and cut off by the moon.</p>
<p>The old story of the cuckoo crowing at Biqi Temple (it is said to be the place where Zhu Yingtai studied), the fragrant soul enters the song and covers the southeast, the ancient Neptune Hall loses dreams, and countless white beards are overturned on the ground.</p>
<p>In the evening years, I will send a warning to the spring old woman, and there is not much space for a cloth tent to settle. Who can fulfill the former dynasty's wish for landscape? Do not bother the incense and fire to worship Dongpo.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Carefree on the Sea (118)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai said, "She has good intentions. I myself have also examined my past, and I believe there are several benefits to my return: First, my parents at home can rest assured; second, I will no longer have wild fantasies and will wholeheartedly strive in my career. You should understand my intentions." Feng Sheng nodded and said, "If you can truly do this, I would be very relieved. However, I cannot believe you yet. You must succeed in your career before you return." Zhu Zhai said, "According to what you say, I cannot return for the time being?" Feng Sheng said, "Yes." Zhu Zhai said, "Why are you rejecting me?" Feng Sheng said, "To put it nicely, it's to give you a little more motivation; to put it bluntly, I don't believe you." Zhu Zhai said, "I've said all this, and you still don't believe me? Then what do you want me to do?" Feng Sheng said, "I hope you follow what Sister Yunqing said in her letter: cherish your reputation and create a future." Zhu Zhai said, "Then I need some spiritual sustenance." Feng Sheng said, "Your spirit should be placed on your career. In short, before you succeed, don't even think about coming back!" Seeing that she spoke so firmly, Zhu Zhai sighed and said, "Your temper is always like this, not flexible at all. You have to think that there is no ill will between us as husband and wife, but our personalities are a bit different. If I accommodate you in the future, and you accommodate me, there won't be any problems." Feng Sheng said, "Now is not the time to talk about that. If you can truly respect what Yunqing said in her letter, then go out and create a career. As for me, you don't have to worry. I won't remarry, and I won't burden you. You can rest assured." Zhu Zhai said, "It is impossible for me to create a career in Beiping City. I must leave Beiping. However, I am afraid there will be problems with your livelihood." Feng Sheng said, "That's okay. Even in the past two months when you haven't brought my living expenses on time, I've been doing just fine. Let me tell you, I have a job now too." Zhu Zhai didn't believe her when he heard she had a job and said, "Who hired you?" Feng Sheng said, "If you don't believe me, I can ask Miss Han in the house to come out and testify." As she spoke, she called out loudly, "Han Yu! Han Yu! Please come out!" As she spoke, Miss Han in the house had already pushed open the door and walked out gracefully.</p>
