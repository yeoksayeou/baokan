<p>〔本報訊〕孫科昨晨七時許再度自京來滬，醫治足疾。據孫氏表示：日內卽返京。又昨日上午吳市長曾赴孫氏寓邸訪候。下午潘議長·杜月笙·趙曾珏等亦曾往訪。下午四時許，孫氏在其哥倫比亞路私寓接見往訪記者，發表談話稱：本人廿五日奉總統之命組閣，事前旣未考慮及此，根本全無凖備，故組閣事全出被動。現値時局舉步維艱之秋，當須有戰時內閣之編制，方資應付。故本人尙待戰時內閣編制方案確定後，方能遵循就職。刻吳鐵城氏曾擬就該項編制方案，尙待硏討核定。個人對戰時內閣之看法，竄爲閣員務必起用有經騐，有領導能力及能負責之新人，國民黨內各派系人士，均將延攬參加，終望放棄過去恩怨，戮力合作參政。民。靑兩黨之參政與否，則尙待雙方洽商，希望人數集中後，一掃過去辦事延冗之積習。同時將採行分層負責制，重大事件，集議商決，例行公事，各部應當機立斷，蓋戰時內閣，務必負起責任內閣之職責，方不致事事均須請示總統批決。本人脫離執政職務，業已十七年，連年均承乏立法院，故對再長政院一事，並不感覺興趣，惟承總統堅邀，又不得不勉爲其難。</p>

<p>孫氏旋答覆記者問，茲探誌大要如次：（一）外傳戰時內閣成立後，政院原有各部會將考慮裁撤或兼併，此事尙未決定。（二）外傳新政院組成後，立法。監察兩院將吿無形休會，亦非事實。（三）滬各界建議開放內河航行權，减輕運輸成本，渠亦頗表贊同。（四）美旣有軍事顧問團駐華，則該團有所建議，當儘量考慮採納。（五）國防部原有組織，必須改革，現正研究改革辦法中。（六）美國援華問題，現美方本身意見亦不一致，惟相信美國決能援華。（七）改善公敎人員待遇，須與增加國庫收入兼籌並顧，方克有濟，臨時財產稅如能切實付諸實施，未始不能增加稅入，則公敎人負待遇亦可望隨以增加。（八）所謂「豪門」，標準究竟如何，亟望民意機關儘量提供意見，以資參考。（九）有謂政府目前頗失民心，此點政府固當負責，惟同時亦望人民推誠合作，政府人民如能合作，打成一片，則事無不能爲者。（十）戒嚴法實行後，對新聞自由頗有限制，惟此係出自非常時期所不能不然者。（十一）對整個戰局，本人因與各方久疏接觸，故未敢妄加判斷。（孫科對美記者發表個人意見刋第二版）</p>

<h3 id="c24">當今敎育的措置 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 周尚</p>
<p>一般人都在注目軍事，其實軍事只要將帥用命，士氣振作戰局自可轉危爲安。而最根本者，還須澈頭澈尾澄淸政治，整肅官方，賞罰分明，進賢殺不肖，則中外人士對吾政府，定能刮目相看。</p>
<p>我們目前面臨着的大問題，敎育是其中之一，當局宜有明快迅速的措置，時至今日，火燒到眉毛，如果還是一籌莫展，不免令人太傷感了。「亂」的惡魔，就在這靑黃不接時躍躍欲試。說來又要怪張三，怨李四，其實這種「亂」就是措置不當所迫出來的。淪陷區學生的流亡，危險區返籍學生的借讀，缺糧食缺燃料區學生的伙食，私立學校的加費或停辦，師生的反常心理，師範生等公費待遇，敎職員待過，敎育物費的安排，兵佔校舍的防止等等，都該統盤籌劃，預爲之謀，切勿臨渴掘井，手足無措！</p>
<p>淪陷區學生的流亡，本報已加討論，籲請從速善爲處理。邇來姻台學生流亡上海，增加上海社會的不安，此事應由敎部主辦，地方敎育行政機關協助，不能倒賓爲主。而上海照料這批學生，敎部雖派員到滬，却祇躱在背後。南京一到就是一萬五千流亡學生，車站滿地皆是嗷嗷待哺的下一代，勢必源源前往。蘇州亦去了四百多鄭汴學生，衣食住都沒辦法解決。目前京滬一綫，時入非常，豈可再容淪亡學生東竄西奔？敎育當局急應指定比較的安全地帶，儘量收容，予以善待；這是責無旁貸。</p>
<p>再有零星的流亡學生，個別的考入了相當學校，孑然一身，經濟斷絶，旣無親友，更鮮故知，秋盡冬來，畫則殻觫而立，夜則冷不成寐，飢寒交迫，梵梵無吿，將何以爲繼？他們都是我們民族的兒女，下代的菁英，當局亦應送衣送被，拿出切實救濟的辦法。行政院應予迅速中援，討錢時勿再走大圈子了。</p>
<p>戰區附近或宵禁地帶，社會阢隉，人心不安，神經敏感性的人，扶老携幼，紛紛避難，車站碼頭，秩序紊亂。學校自然亦呈着動盪現象，敎職員不安於位，外籍學生相率回原地，像這種景况，對敎職員應有一個安排，雖不能有保陣，但也要有一種安慰。外籍的女敎職員欲辭走，欲吿假，理宜從寬，好得學生日减，儘可併班。對返籍學生急應仿照抗戰時期頒佈『借讀辦法』，免得中途輟學，養成遊手好閒的惡習慣。</p>
<p>八十天來幣制政策自改革而補充而修正，這三個階段中，因限價而搶購，因搶購而造成米荒·柴荒·菜荒·油荒等等，這一連串的荒，學生伙食大成問題。許多學校由吃粥而斷炊，事態十分嚴重，現在雖已過去，可是自費生和公費生苦難重重。公費生副食費已增一倍半，杯水車薪無濟於事，而這種增費的命令還遲遲達不到各地學校，學校又拿什麼來維持？政府打官話目然容易，而學生肚子是現實的。最好學生的伙食能配給食物，其次參照生活指數酌加，中央增費的辦法務須隨時在當日或最短期間達到各地學校，立刻領款應用，否則加費未到，物價又跳，斷不是一個長久之　。</p>
<p>一部分私立學校，處於今日，却成了難於維持的局面。照理，私立學校的經濟基礎建築在校董會身上，不過多數私校校董會祇是一個幌子，大都爲「空城計』。立案時的基金借來存在銀行裏，視察的人明知是一個騙局。國家無力普設學校，賴私校維持敎育，像這樣局面下，只是助長亂源。凡自私之徒，以及營私集團所辦的學校，應與優良學校分出一個皂白。請瞧良好的私校，不加費，不停課，是値得讃美値得做榜樣的。繳學費時是以廿金圓一石米的代價支付的，那時金圓很値錢，家長爲子弟納費，已竭噙駝之力，如今增費，力量如何？看董仲舒·胡瑗·周濂溪·張橫渠·顧炎武輩敎育家，我們將何顏以對？</p>
<p>敎職員待遇一事，自勝利以來喊到現在，往日已壞，於今爲烈。多謝立監委熱腸代抱不平，然而不平之鳴，依然是「鳴」，絲毫無補於實際。財部用飢餓政策對待敎師，使一般敎師吃不飽，餓不死，與公務員同樣地被柴米油菜包圍中度日，實在不是一個上策。敎師待遇，在限價時節早不能仰事俯畜，如今物價跳至十倍以上，而敎師薪金只加一倍半，欲買一石米而不得，「罷敎』潮如洪水的泛濫，從何談起敎育兩字？這種事件給下一代看了，豈不是一種反敎育！十五日立法院又通過增加辦法，但須提交政務會議，審査會議，再送立院，再審査，再討論，再送政院，公事大旅行，等到辦法頒佈之日，敎師豈不將入枯魚之肆！如此討論下來，十一月已過，財部樂得十二月份起加，『飢餓政策』之外，復加上『揩油政策』。像這樣的得意傑作，已不知演過幾次，切望不再蹈其覆轍。（十一，廿五，）</p>

<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕中國新任行政院長孫科，廿七日單獨會見合衆社記者，發表談話，並聲明此係其個人意見。渠希望不日能組成代表全國各階層之政府，然不擬邀謂共產黨入閣</p>
<p>取得軍援政策　將提內閣討論</p>
<p>孫科稱：環境如此，故其政府在若干方面必將反映美國之見解，孫氏再稱：據渠個人看來，中國應作合理讓步，傳早日取得重要之美國軍事援助，渠擬將此政策交內閣討論。孫博士稱：中國亟需麥克阿瑟一流美國軍界碩宿來華祖任最高軍事顧問，指導剿共戰事，中國並願付以全權。詢以是否贊成重開長江及其他內河，供外船駛用，運卸出入貨品，孫氏答應渠擬如此。渠稱：在若干情况下，美國海軍船隻可根據美軍事顧問之意見，而利用中國內河，如能成立一方策，由美軍艦巡弋長江，中國自不表反對。孫氏再度强調所言悉係私人意見稱，渠贊成立卽以「新政」優待在上海及中國他地之外商，合理鼓勵及保護外商之權益，渠希望留滬期間，能與美國及其他外商會談，並已邀請上海美商會提供建議表。</p>
<p>共黨如佔中國　全亞即將赤化</p>
<p>孫博士稱：渠不以爲有與中共談和之可能，並相信將作戰到底。渠又稱，渠相信蔣總統決心不問一切，繼續作戰，總統並認爲取得大宗美援極有指望。孫氏稱，目前並未想到遷都廣州或他處，孫科稱：中共係世界共產運動之一部，與蘇聯密切合作，當無疑問，如共產黨奄有中國，則全亞洲之赤化僅爲「時間問題」，而日本及菲列賓日後亦或將陷入共產掌握中。孫院長稱，蘇聯目前之對華政策，似在東北立卽成立强有力據點，而積極南進，共產計劃似尙不在創立獨立之「滿洲國」家，猶如日本之所爲者。反之，孫氏稱，中共可能首先以「中國人民民主國」一類名義成立政權，以博人民之好感，然後於根深蒂固後，將根據蘇聯之路錢，而成立全部極權政府。</p>

<h3 id="c50">對於柏林貨幣問題意見　四強覆文正式公布　英美法認為單獨談判幣制無濟於事　中立國將提出另一新建議 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕安全理事會將於廿九日召開以便硏究柏林問題。據聯合國方面消息稱：安理會主席勃拉馬格里亞，又將於今日向四强提出一項渠與各中立國共同草成之新建議，此項建議係根據四强對渠關於柏林貨幣問題徵詢意見書之覆文起草而成。聞勃拉馬格里亞在渠於十二月一日將此項建議呈交於安理會新主席比代表前，將先提出於安理會。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕據聯合國消息靈通方面稱：安理會主席勃拉馬格里亞將以關於柏林問題之新建議一項，於明日交於蘇英美法四國，請後者在星期一提出答覆，新建議中所包含解決柏林問題之新方式，乃兩日來六中立國專家詳細硏究之結果，如四國能在規定之時間內提出答覆，則勃拉馬格里亞當於星期一下午或星期二召開安理會作一決定。按專事處理柏林問題而代理安理會主席之勃拉馬格里亞將於十一月三十日結束其任命，今晚勃拉馬格里亞已將蘇聯與英美法三國對柏林幣制問題意見徵詢書之覆文，以及英法財政專家關於此一問題之備忘錄予以發表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿六日電〕美英法三國廿六日事實上已關閉柏林問題有任何協議可能之門戶，直至蘇聯肯恢復在四强管制下之柏林市政府。四强公布彼等答覆安全理事會主席阿根廷外長勃拉馬格里亞所提徵詢書之覆文後，西方三强之立塲，遂吿披露。彼等之覆文披露，西方列强認爲蘇聯幾已完全分裂柏林爲兩個不同區域。西方覆文明白表示，三强認爲在柏林行政分裂之際，及當蘇聯似決以其餘任何可能方法再分裂柏林之際，卽使企圖重建柏林單一幣制事，亦已無用。此語意謂，必須先恢復包括一切行政機構之統一之柏林，然後再考慮幣制問題。西方覆文控斥在四强管制下之柏林統一行政「正在迅速消滅中」。蘇聯致勃氏之覆文，較西方國家之覆文遠爲簡單。該覆文重申蘇聯之要求，卽要求履行八月間莫斯科協議作爲四强管制柏林幣制問題之基礎。按蘇聯所提及之莫斯科協議，規定接受蘇聯之東德馬克爲柏林全市之唯一幣制及蘇聯解除柏林之封鎖，兩事同時實行。該協議曾發交德境四强軍事長官實施，但柏林會議又陷優局。</p>

<p>希外長蔡爾達理斯稱：希遊擊隊係東南歐全世界和平之威脅。英代表則認外國干涉係造成希內戰之主要原因，渠力主希臘與其北鄰建立外交關係。中國代表則表示擁護多數議案，並稱，希臘係外國侵略之犧牲品，足以咸脅世界和平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕蘇聯代表維辛斯基今日在聯大會議中發言一小時四十分鐘，攻繫巴爾幹調査團之報吿書，指爲美英帝國主義干涉希臘之口實。演說畢，斯拉夫集團代表報以掌聲。中國代表蔣廷黻繼起發言，擁護調查團之報吿書。略謂，帝國主義爲何物，有目共見，二次世界大戰後，美國放棄菲列賓，英國亦畁予印度，巴基斯坦，緬甸及鍚蘭獨立。全世界倘僅受此種帝國主義方式的威脅，則聯大會議代表儘可返家。贈給本國人民最好之聖誕禮物世界和平，與世界安全，蔣氏辭畢，博得熟烈掌聲。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿六日電〕南斯拉夫代表員白菜今日指斥美國對希臘人民作戰，並對東歐施行經濟冷戰，一部份代表在其高聲演說時閉目而睡，英國代理外長麥克尼爾卽爲其一。波闌提議禁止一國對他國施行經濟壓力，以影響其對內對外政策，藉此譴責美國援助歐洲復興計劃，被大會以三十三票對六票否決，僅蘇聯集團投贊成票，印度，緬甸及菲律賓棄權。</p>

<p>— 本報時約記者　王瘦梅</p>
<p>〔本報無錫廿五日快訊〕無錫北十二里許之陳家橋，於今晨八時發生鄕民有組織之兇案，參加此案之鄕民達六七百人，新近在該村成立之河南聯中橫遭搗毀，該校學生有三十八人受傷，並有學生二十七人被持手槍棍棒之鄕民毆打後捆綁投河，生死不明。當暴行進行時，學生被鄕民追擊，宛如羔羊之遇狼羣，哀號求救之聲，數里外均可聞見。綠該校共有學生一千一百九十二人，純係由河南流亡南來之初中學生，年齡均在十六七歲左右，每人每日由校方轉發食米二十兩，副食費三角五分，自本月初限價開放後，學生副食費僅油鹽兩項已不敷用，該地以燒柴奇缺，學生全月副食費尙不足購稻草半担，不得已由學生目行拾柴，間有因攀折桑柳乾枝而與鄕民發生口角者，惟以學校當局管理嚴格，迄尙未發生不幸事件。不料今晨八時許，一學生因購買燒餅，與陳家橋燒餅店主人發生糾紛，校內敎職員聞訊後，卽赶往勸阻，乃圍觀鄕民竟拔出</p>
<p>手槍威脅</p>
<p>同時並鳴鑼呼嘨，糾衆喊打一時鄕民歡百人在少數人領導煽動下，蜂擁而到校務處大打出手，所有門窗桌櫈文卷及辦公用具全部搗毀，該校主任王俊傑及敎員等出面慰勸，亦遭毆打，與學校隔壁之張村區區長胡虔時亦在塲，而亦無適當措置，制止暴亂。此外，距該村四五里之尤家祠，吳家祠及王家宕各處所住學生，亦同時被鄕民作有計劃之毆打，其規模之大，情形之慘，更甚於陳家橋。各該處學生以變起倉卒，毫無防備，故皆束手被打吳家詞之鄕民於包圍學生宿舍後，並上房揭屋，向學生投擲磚石，且擬縱火焚毀宿舍，以附近婦女哀求，始吿幸免。間有少數學生逃奔野外，卽遭成羣鄕民鳴槍追擊，攔路羣毆。王家宕鄉民數百人，於痛毆學生後，並將學生符鶴立等二十七人用繩捆綁投入河中，以河水過深，故除符鶴立一名因諳水性泅出，生命危在旦夕外，其餘二十六人迄晚仍未撈出。尤家祠及逃散學生聞亦有被投河活埋者，現以秩序尚未恢復，故究竟死亡學生若干，尙無法調査。現受傷學生已查出卅八人，鄉民則無一傷亡，因學生在校方嚴厲管制下，迄未反抗，故尙未釀成更不幸之械鬥。此事發生後，首都衛戍總部無錫指揮所政工處長葉兆興，科長穆岳，無錫城防司令部督導劉佑農，無錫縣政府保警第二大隊長朱亞伯等，均奉令率軍警及醫務人員，於上午十二時到塲彈壓調査，葉等以目覩學校被毀之慘及幼年流亡學生頭破血流斷臂殘腿之狀，均極痛心，除飭將受重傷學生廿三人送往城內住院治療外，當卽將事前疏於防範，臨時未能制止之胡區長大加斥責，並限卽刻捉學兇首，胡區長畏難退縮，遲至薄暮，始交出兩人帶城訊辦，爲恐當晚再右類此事件發生，並由胡區長向負責當局具結保證該校員生安全，一塲風波，至此始吿暫息。據事後調查：此次暴行，頗有政洽背景，該村士紳高某於行兇時因被羣衆脅迫不從，致其家亦被搗毀，現此事仍在發展，深望有關當局速謀合理合法解決，藉維後方治安。</p>

<h3 id="c123">民心 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>此次美國大選，杜魯門總統以聯任當選出了一個冷門。不僅事先穩操勝算的杜威一輩人覺得事出意料之外，就連幾個一向以辦理「民意測驗」著名的所謂民意機關，亦覺得無話可說。到今天所聽到的唯一解釋，一致認爲是美國的民心轉向促成了杜魯門的勝利。</p>
<p>美國總統誰屬，是美國人的事。不過以杜魯門先生當時所處的劣勢，而居然能取得壓倒的勝利，民心的成份是不可否認的，因爲美國雖然有華爾街的堡壘，但美國畢竟是現代世界各國中最够得上民主之稱的國家，民心成人心　　　　在政治上是可能起決定性作用的。</p>
<p>可是民心或人心究竟是怎樣一種東西？我們俗話中曾有「人心不同各如其面」的說法，表示人心這東西是最不可捉摸的。心理學中的羣衆心理部門，恐怕就是硏究這種民心或人心。不過個人認爲深通羣衆心理的人，不一定就是能深獲民心的人。一個深通權術政治的政治家，自然懂得把握羣衆心理，可是他却不一定能把握眞芷的民心。這是因爲羣衆心理是屬於技術的，而民心則是隴於道義的。</p>
<p>能獲民心而兼能把握羣衆心理，自能必操勝算，但僅賴運用羣衆心理，雖有時亦能獲得成功，不過這種成功的壽命不會長久。歷代的櫂奸，大槪都是能運用羣衆心理的，但他們終不過是權奸而已。希特勒和墨索里尼，就是這一類的典型。</p>
<p>然則民心究竟是甚麽？民意怎能把握？我雖非心理學家，但是我敢將民心譬作流水，它可順流，也能逆流，有時且會橫決；它可把一個人捧上三十三天，也會把同一個人打入十八層地獄。十八世紀的法國大革命中，卽有幾位被人民視爲一世英豪的人物，曾被同樣的「民心」送上了斷頭台。民心之不可捉摸，實在是使人望而生畏。易卜生的「人民之公敵與社會之棟樑」一劇中，曾將民心的盲目一面作過諷刺的刻劃。</p>
<p>原來民心雖是一種不可抗拒的力量，却也並不是最可靠的，因爲它是理智與感情的混合產物，有時可能成爲一種傾向的最後判斷，有時却祗是一種盲目的力量，可能引入歧途。民意測騐之不全可靠，也就是因爲這個道理。</p>
<p>然而民心或人心這東西是存在的，而且確具有決定性的力量，它確具有「順我者生，逆我者死」的魄力。雖然它是一個抽衆的存在，却小則可以改變時潮，大則可以創造歷史，它能創造，亦能毀滅。問題是在怎樣把握民心，怎樣運用人心。古語所謂「順天者昌」，實亦無非叫人怎樣把握民心而已。</p>
<p>惟因民心旣不是完全可靠，欲加把握就非具有大智大慧不可；換句話說，把握民心並非是一味俯順之謂，而是着重於適當的誘導。我曾說民心猶如流水。順水推舟，有時固不失是俯順民意，不過最要緊的還是在能看淸水源，予以疏導。若問民心的水源何在，謹答之日「公道」。</p>
<p>「公道自在人心」這句話是極普通的，但正唯因爲是極普通的，才代表着一個眞理。我們的社會設施合於公道嗎？我們的政治制度合於公道嗎？我們的經濟施策合於公道嗎？人心趨向的問題，就有待於這個公道的答案。</p>
<p>現在常聽人在呼籲收拾民心，但據我看，已失的民心等於覆水難收，倒不如重建公道以振民心，才是根本上策。</p>

<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>近日讀報，除廣吿與副刋外，其餘國內外電訊，本市消息，大都以令人攢眉者爲多。但在攢眉的新聞中，就文人的立塲而言，却讀到了幾篇好文章。</p>
<p>例如，有一篇好文章是對東京諸罪犯的麥帥覆判書。麥帥的幕府中，一定也有一位文章高手。這位高手能够在莊嚴的文吿中避免官樣文章，而處處施以感情的油彩，這是我國的幕府記室中獨缺的一種長處。猶憶麥帥初蒞東京，受降時發表的談話，劈頭便說，「自珍珠港到東京遙遠之路程，吾人終於抵達矣。」一種撫今追昔的感情，躍然紙上。</p>
<p>此次麥帥所發表的覆判書，亦是如此。在覆判書的起苜，便是這樣開頭：「本人宦海浮沉，多遇不如意事，然本心所最不願而不得不爲者，首推此次覆査遠東國際軍事法庭所判日本戰犯被吿之罪刑。」其謙抑而不得已的情懷，幾乎使我們不信是出諸於、位叱咤風雲的統帥筆下！今日世上的人大都認爲麥帥管制日太，政策過於溫和。此論關繫世界大勢，非此小文所敢論列。但他能够屛除驕矜，不以戰勝者採取報復手段自居，其撫懷寬宏的襟度，値得世人之揣摩。且看麥帥對於判決書的態度：「凡人之所決定，決不能永無過失。然本人深知誠無法以較此審更妥善之方法，以彰明正義公道者矣。……第現下文明社會之進化猶未完備，固另無其他機構更有資格及信心，以下此莊嚴之判決。」他同意國際軍事法庭判決的出發點，便是基於上述理由。</p>
<p>對於執行大審判刑的目的，麥帥的用意是「昭示天下善良人羣，以戰爭之無用，而僅係人類最大之罪惡，及最卑鄙之浩刦，並啓導全球各國，一體唾棄戰爭。」這是麥帥覆判書中唯一露出的一隻官樣文章的馬脚。因爲「天下善良人羣」，早已知道戰爭之無用，但仍不能免於此「卑鄙之浩刦」。此「最大之罪惡」，還在不絕製造或進行之中，豈眞如麥帥所說，「現下文明社會之進化，猶未完備」之故乎？</p>
<p>最後應該一提的是此合衆社電訊中譯，確是雅而又達，能够用另外一國文字委婉傳達原電的精神。當我們一按原文，就可知道著手翻譯此電訊之難，而刋載於各大報的此中文電訊，當然是覺得最滿意的一篇了。</p>
<p>還裏乘便想提出一點，電訊的中文開頭爲「本人宦海浮沈」，其原文爲In　long　public　service，麥帥是現役軍人，似與中文的「宦海」不大吻合，而且下面「浮沈」二字僅是成語之沿用，別無原文可以覆按。鄙意擬改爲「本人久列行伍」，不過這近於吹毛，因爲在忽促的時間中要翻譯許多電訊，不容你這樣咬文嚼字來推敲也。</p>

<p>— 款乃</p>
<p>艾森豪威元帥在第二次大戰中領導聯軍，攻北非，攻西西里，義大利登陸，法國登陸，解放全歐，擊潰了德國無數名將，眞可說是勳業蓋世，名垂千古，無怪這次美國大選前有許多人要請他出來競選大總統了。這裏是兩個小小例子，可以使我們看出他的卓識。</p>
<p>在義大利登陸戰進行中，美軍得一情報，說是德國將領正任加緊宣傳，誇大戰果，以期鼓勵士氣。</p>
<p>艾森豪威將軍却說：他們在誇張勝利，但我們却千萬不要誇大。我們絶對不能使國內有一種錯誤的感覺，以爲我們的勝利是一件輕而易舉的事。這種錯覺所造成的祗是一種過分的樂觀，而過分的樂觀在偶遇挫折的時候便往往會成爲過分的悲觀。過分的樂觀無益，而過分的悲觀則有大害。</p>
<p>因之，在盟軍順利地在法國登陸時艾森豪威雖明知已得初步成功，在招待記者時却一再强調着戰爭前途必然艱苦，全國軍民必須加緊努力——絶無一句沾沾自喜的話！</p>
<p>又一次，是在盟軍迫近柏林，却又轉向東南進軍的時候。他決定不佔領柏林，一時美國報章痛加指斥，認爲失去了一個大好機會。但艾森豪威說，作戰的目的是在擊潰敵人的軍力，使戰爭早日結束。那時德軍在東南境號稱擁有强大兵團，稱爲「民族堡壘」，盟軍當然不能爲了一城一市而不先把道個阻力淸除。至於柏林，得了固然在報紙上可以做大標題，但是，他說，「我們打仗並不是爲了大標題。」</p>
<p>艾森豪威的成功，不是偶然的！</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] After completing his military deployment in Bengbu, Gu Zhutong returned to Nanjing by plane at noon on the 27th. Before leaving Bengbu, Gu flew over the front lines from Bengbu to inspect the situation. It is also learned that the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters arrived in Bengbu from Xuzhou on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 27th] Liu Zhi arrived in Bengbu by special plane at 12:05 PM on the 27th. After a 20-minute stop at the airport, he gave instructions to the generals stationed in Bengbu who came to meet him, and then returned to Xuzhou by the same plane.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 26th] Since Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong arrived in Bengbu, the battle situation between Xuzhou and Bengbu will apparently enter a new phase. The peripheral battles of Xuzhou have subsided. The main force of the bandits on the eastern front are gradually moving south. In the area north of Lingbi and Suxian, the air force has spotted a portion of the bandits in movement. Suxian has become a veritable vacuum. After the Nationalist Huang Wei and Li Yannian Corps converged south of Suxian, they are in a state of confrontation with Liu's 3rd and 9th Columns and Chen Yi's 6th Column across the Tuo River. There have been no major battles in recent days. However, military sources indicate that a major battle will unfold within three days. Furthermore, it has been determined that the bandits attacking Lingbi are the 13th Column of Chen Yi's forces. After three days of fierce fighting, the bandits suddenly broke into the western gate yesterday afternoon. According to news this morning, there are reports that the city has been captured by the bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 27th] The Bengbu Garrison Headquarters has been reorganized from the original joint military-police-constabulary inspection office and is now headed by a certain army commander Gan Zhaolong as commander. This was done by order of Chief of Staff Gu. Also, Zhou Weilong, the commander of the Jinpu Railway South Section Protection Command, came to Bengbu at 1:00 PM today, immediately met with Chief of Staff Gu to receive instructions, and then returned to his Mingguang station by special train at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch on the 27th] There has been fierce fighting in the Tuohe Town front, fifty li southwest of Lingbi, since the evening of the 26th, and it is still continuing as of noon on the 27th. The sound of artillery can be faintly heard in Bengbu. The bandit unit is the 13th Column, which the military calls the opening battle.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 27th] There were localized battles along the Huaihe River in southern Suxian today. The Nationalist forces on the southern front of Xuzhou have advanced south, and are coordinating with the Huang and Li Corps moving north to launch a combined attack on the main forces of Liu's bandits and remnants of Chen's bandits in the Suxian, Lingbi, and Fuliji areas. Air Force squadrons flew over the area south and northeast of Suxian today, conducting extensive aerial searches for the moving bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] The main battle, centered around the outskirts of Suxian, has officially begun today. The bandits trapped in the Nationalist forces' pocket formation were heavily attacked by Nationalist forces on the line from Dongpingji to Shuangyingji, 15 kilometers south of Suxian and west of the Huaihe River, and the fighting was extremely fierce. A large squadron from the Xuzhou base took off at dawn to assist in the battle, and intensified its aerial offensive in the afternoon, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits. The air force alone claimed over 5,000 bandits killed or wounded today. The gains of the ground forces were many times greater. Such fierce fighting continued into the night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] Military News: The Nationalist forces south of Xuzhou launched an offensive towards Suxian from both sides of the Jinpu Railway this morning. The eastern route defeated the stubborn resistance of the 46th and 47th Divisions of the Lunan Column of bandits, capturing dozens of villages such as Xianlou and Shuangjing southeast of Sanbao. The western route defeated the stubborn resistance of the Liangguang Column of bandits and the local communist Jin Shaoshan's forces, capturing Gushanj, and is now advancing victoriously towards the south.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th] The Nationalist forces south of Xuzhou began their offensive towards Suxian yesterday, achieving considerable success. This morning at 9:00 AM, this reporter visited General Sun Yuanliang, commander of that line, who reported a victory: The Hu Xiaocong Corps of his army officially recovered Gushanj early this morning. The vanguard is about 120 li from Suxian. In this battle, over 800 bandits were killed or wounded, and over 200 were captured, while our casualties were less than 100. The bandits facing them were Chen Yi's Liangguang Column and an independent brigade. The reporter then drove to another position to observe the battle. The bandits were entrenched on Shaomao Mountain. Our artillery continuously fired shells to bombard them. The fortifications of the bandits on Shaomao Mountain were visible through binoculars. Every shell landed on key points. The foreign reporters who came to observe also expressed their admiration. At about noon, this reporter personally witnessed Nationalist soldiers jumping out of their trenches and charging forward at the forward sentry company position of the Wang Corps. The bandits on the mountaintop suffered heavy casualties. The remaining bandits could not hold out and retreated behind the mountain, and the mountain was captured.</p>

After liberating the city, the Nationalist forces continued to advance towards Gaomi. At the same time, Hongshiya on the coast of Jiaozhou Bay was also recovered. Military officials believe that this action is of great significance, as Hongshiya was a port for the bandits to transfer supplies and smuggle goods, and it has now been completely blocked. Another route of Nationalist forces made contact with the bandits in the Bieshanwei area. Commander Liu Anqi is personally commanding at the front. It is expected that the Jiaodong battle will have new developments.</p>

<p>[United Press, Liuji Village near Xuzhou, 26th] General Qiu Qingquan met with reporters at his forward headquarters southeast of Xuzhou on the 26th and frankly admitted that he was not satisfied with the current battle results. He also suspected that the communists might use a sickle-shaped offensive to bypass Xuzhou and the defense line south of Xuzhou, thus threatening the Yangtze River basin. He claimed that he had annihilated 150,000 men under Chen Yi's command on the eastern and southeastern fronts. When reporters asked about the losses of Qiu's own headquarters, Qiu smiled and said, "I lost three men." When reporters asked him to explain further, Qiu pointed out that after the battle in Shandong last year, the communist commander had announced that the communists had lost three men.</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Jidong Battle Has Not Yet Matured; Military Authorities Express Confidence in Overwhelming Victory; Nationalist Forces Recover Xianghe and Approach Baodi <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] Yan Youwen, spokesperson for the North China Pacification Headquarters, said on the 26th that the battle in Miyun, Jidong, is not yet ripe. It cannot be predicted when the major battle will break out, whether it will be a mobile war or a fortified defense. It has been determined that the Northeast bandit troops entering the pass are the 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Columns. The 8th, 9th, and 11th Columns are part of Cheng Zihua's bandit forces, which were dealt a heavy blow by the North China Nationalist forces in the autumn sweep. The 4th and 7th Columns were also defeated by the North China Nationalist forces in Jinxi Tashan recently. With the bandits' current strength, it seems that they are not sufficient to support a major battle.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] The North China military authorities are extremely optimistic about the future Jidong battle. A high-ranking official declared that the Nationalist forces have at least a 95% chance of victory in this campaign. He also said that there are enough daily necessities in Beiping and Tianjin for half a year, and enough food for three months. After American aid arrives directly in North China, there will be no shortage of supplies.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced: (1) The Nationalist forces in Jidong were stationed in Xianghe on the afternoon of the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, they cleared up scattered bandits in over 20 villages near Dawangzhuang and Hou Taogou, and have now crossed the Qukou Town, 30 li east of Xianghe. (2) The light cavalry unit of the Nationalist forces north of Tianjin is approaching Baodi. The Nationalist forces control an area of 200 li in length and width in Sanhe and Baodi.</p>
<p>[Our Tongxian Dispatch on the 27th] After General Shi Jue's powerful corps voluntarily withdrew from western Rehe, the posture of the Nationalist forces in northern Pingbei has been significantly strengthened. Tongxian has recently been teeming with soldiers, tanks, and machine guns and has formed an important base in northern Hebei. The people are calm, food prices are stable, and there are no bandits within 50 li east of the county due to the pressure of the Nationalist forces. The bandits in Xianghe, who had built a large wooden bridge at Wangjiaban, 70 li east of Tongxian, were blown up by the Nationalist forces on the 25th, and their attempt to cross the river and invade westward was crushed head-on.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 27th] After the redeployment of the Nationalist forces in North China, the military value of the Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao areas has greatly decreased. It is learned that the local people have completed their evacuation.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 27th] According to the Zhengda newspaper here, Zhu Zhankui, the third district's Suppression Commander stationed in Wangqingtuo, west of Tianjin, suddenly led more than 2,000 troops west on the 22nd and has arrived in Baxian, and it is widely rumored that he has defected to the enemy.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 26th] After the Baoding battle, Nie Rongzhen's bandit 3rd and 4th Columns appeared to be moving towards southern Chahar. Nie's bandit 1st, 2nd, and 6th Columns on the Chahar-Sui border are also gathering around Yanggao and the area west of Zhangjiakou, and it seems they have new intentions. It is reported that the bandit 2nd Column is fleeing back to Yixian, the 4th Column is entrenched in Dawangdian, and the 7th Column has retreated to the area north of Rongcheng.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] After the Political Committee of the Northeast Pacification Headquarters retreated to Beiping, it was deemed unnecessary to continue its existence and requested to be abolished. The request has recently been approved by the Executive Yuan. The Committee will be closed in Beiping by the end of this month, and all current personnel will be given three months' salary as severance pay.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing again yesterday morning at about 7:00 AM to treat his foot ailment. According to Sun, he will return to Nanjing within days. Also, Mayor Wu visited Sun's residence yesterday morning. In the afternoon, Speaker Pan, Du Yuesheng, Zhao Zengjue, and others also visited. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Sun met with visiting reporters at his private residence on Columbia Road and issued a statement, saying: "I was ordered by the President on the 25th to form a cabinet. I had not considered this beforehand and had no preparation at all, so the cabinet formation was entirely passive. Now, at a time when the situation is difficult, there must be a wartime cabinet organization to cope with the situation. Therefore, I am still waiting for the wartime cabinet organization plan to be finalized before I can take office. Wu Tiecheng has drafted the organization plan, which is still under study and approval. My personal view on the wartime cabinet is that it must enlist new people with experience, leadership ability, and responsibility. People from all factions within the Kuomintang will be invited to participate. It is hoped that they will abandon past grievances and work together to participate in politics. Whether the Minzhu and Qing parties will participate is still under negotiation between the two sides. It is hoped that after the number of people is concentrated, the accumulation of delays in handling affairs in the past can be swept away. At the same time, a layered responsibility system will be adopted. Major events will be discussed and decided collectively, while for routine matters, the various departments should make decisive decisions. A wartime cabinet must assume the responsibility of a responsible cabinet, so that it does not have to ask the President for instructions and decisions on everything. I have been out of executive office for seventeen years and have been a member of the Legislative Yuan for many years, so I am not interested in being the president of the Executive Yuan again. However, I cannot but reluctantly accept the President's firm invitation."</p>

<p>Sun then answered reporters' questions. The main points are as follows: (1) It is rumored that after the establishment of the wartime cabinet, the original ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan will be considered for abolition or merger. This matter has not yet been decided. (2) It is rumored that after the new Executive Yuan is formed, the Legislative and Control Yuans will be effectively suspended. This is also not true. (3) Shanghai's proposal to open up inland waterway navigation rights and reduce transportation costs was also supported by him. (4) Since there is a US military advisory group stationed in China, the suggestions of the group should be considered and adopted as much as possible. (5) The original organization of the Ministry of National Defense must be reformed, and the reform methods are currently being studied. (6) On the issue of US aid to China, the US itself has inconsistent opinions, but it is believed that the US will definitely aid China. (7) Improving the treatment of civil servants and teachers must be considered in conjunction with increasing the revenue of the national treasury in order to be effective. If the temporary property tax can be effectively implemented, it may be possible to increase tax revenue, and the treatment of civil servants and teachers can also be expected to increase accordingly. (8) What is the standard of the so-called "powerful families"? It is hoped that public opinion organs will provide as much input as possible for reference. (9) It is said that the government has lost public support. The government should be responsible for this. At the same time, it is hoped that the people will cooperate sincerely. If the government and the people can cooperate and become one, nothing is impossible. (10) After the implementation of martial law, there are quite a few restrictions on freedom of the press. This is inevitable in extraordinary times. (11) As for the overall war situation, I dare not make any rash judgments because I have not been in contact with all parties for a long time.

<h3 id="e24">Current Educational Measures <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Generally, people are focused on military affairs. In reality, as long as the generals and commanders are committed and morale is high, the war situation can naturally turn from danger to safety. The most fundamental thing is to thoroughly clarify politics, rectify officialdom, clearly distinguish between rewards and punishments, promote the virtuous and eliminate the unworthy, then Chinese and foreigners will definitely look at our government with new eyes.</p>
<p>The big problems we currently face include education. The authorities should take clear and rapid measures. Now that the fire is burning our eyebrows, it would be too sad if we are still at a loss. The demon of "chaos" is eager to try during this transitional period. In the end, we will blame Zhang San and complain about Li Si, but in reality, this kind of "chaos" is forced out by improper measures. The exodus of students from the occupied areas, the borrowing of students returning from dangerous areas, the food for students in areas lacking food and fuel, the increase in fees or closure of private schools, the abnormal psychology of teachers and students, the public funding of normal school students, the treatment of teachers and staff, the arrangement of educational materials, the prevention of troops occupying school buildings, etc., should all be planned as a whole and prepared in advance. Do not dig a well when you are thirsty, and be at a loss!</p>
<p>This newspaper has already discussed the exodus of students from the occupied areas, calling for a quick and proper handling. Recently, students from Yantai have fled to Shanghai, increasing social unrest in Shanghai. This matter should be handled by the Ministry of Education with the assistance of local educational administrative organs, and should not put the cart before the horse. Although the Ministry of Education has sent personnel to Shanghai to take care of these students, they are hiding behind the scenes. Nanjing immediately received 15,000 refugee students, with the next generation covering the ground at the train station, crying for food, and they will inevitably keep coming. Suzhou also has more than 400 students from Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, and there is no way to solve their food, clothing and housing problems. Currently, the Jinghu line is in a state of emergency, how can refugee students be allowed to run around east and west? The educational authorities should urgently designate a relatively safe area, accommodate them as much as possible, and treat them well; this is an inescapable responsibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are scattered refugee students who have individually entered corresponding schools, alone and without economic support. They have no relatives or friends, and even fewer acquaintances. As autumn ends and winter arrives, they stand shivering in tattered clothes during the day, and cannot sleep due to the cold at night. They are hungry and cold, and cry out without being heard. How can they continue? They are all our nation's children, the elite of the next generation. The authorities should also send clothes and quilts, and come up with practical relief measures. The Executive Yuan should provide quick assistance and should not go through unnecessary bureaucratic procedures when asking for money.</p>
<p>Near war zones or curfew zones, society is uneasy, people are restless, and people with sensitive nerves are fleeing with the old and young, causing disorder at train stations and docks. Naturally, schools also show signs of turmoil, teachers and staff are uneasy in their positions, and foreign students are returning to their home countries one after another. In this kind of situation, arrangements should be made for teachers and staff, even if there can't be a guarantee, there should be some comfort. Foreign female teachers who want to resign or take leave should be treated leniently, and it is fine to merge classes as student numbers decrease. For returning students, the "Borrowing Study Measures" promulgated during the War of Resistance against Japan should be imitated to avoid dropping out of school halfway and developing bad habits of idleness.</p>
<p>Over the past eighty days, the currency policy has been reformed, supplemented, and revised. In these three stages, panic buying was caused by price controls, and this panic buying created a food shortage, a firewood shortage, a vegetable shortage, an oil shortage, etc. This series of shortages has caused major problems with student meals. Many schools have gone from eating porridge to running out of food. The situation is very serious. Although it has passed now, self-funded students and publicly funded students are still facing great difficulties. The non-staple food allowance for publicly funded students has already increased by one and a half times, which is a drop in the bucket, and the order to increase this allowance has been slow to reach schools in various places. What will schools use to maintain themselves? It is naturally easy for the government to give official excuses, but the students' stomachs are a reality. It is best for students' meals to be rationed with food, and secondly, they should be appropriately increased with reference to the cost of living index. The central government's measures to increase fees must reach schools in various places at any time on the same day or in the shortest possible time, and the funds should be received and used immediately. Otherwise, the price will jump again before the fee increase arrives, which is not a long-term solution.</p>
<p>A portion of private schools are in a difficult situation to maintain today. In theory, the economic foundation of private schools is built on the board of directors, but most private school boards of directors are just a façade and are mostly "empty city schemes." The funds when registering are borrowed and deposited in the bank, and the inspectors clearly know it is a deception. The state is unable to universally establish schools and relies on private schools to maintain education. In this kind of situation, it only helps to fuel chaos. Schools run by selfish people and private groups should be distinguished from good schools. Please look at the good private schools that do not increase fees or suspend classes, which are worthy of praise and worthy of being models. When tuition fees were paid, they were paid at the price of 20 gold yuan per stone of rice. At that time, gold yuan was very valuable, and parents had exhausted their strength to pay fees for their children. How can they afford to increase fees now? Looking at educators such as Dong Zhongshu, Hu Yuan, Zhou Lianxi, Zhang Hengqu, and Gu Yanwu, how can we face them?</p>
<p>The issue of teacher treatment has been shouted from the time of victory until now. It was bad in the past, but it is even worse today. Many thanks to the enthusiastic senators and supervisors for speaking up for them, but the cry of injustice is still just a "cry" and does nothing to help the actual situation. The Ministry of Finance uses a starvation policy to treat teachers, making most teachers unable to eat their fill, but also unable to starve to death, living in the same environment of firewood, rice, oil, and vegetables as civil servants, which is really not a good strategy. Teacher treatment could not support families during the price control period, and now that prices have jumped more than ten times, and teacher salaries have only increased by one and a half times, they cannot even afford to buy a stone of rice. The "strike" tide is like a flood. How can we talk about education? When the next generation sees this kind of thing, isn't it a kind of anti-education! On the 15th, the Legislative Yuan passed an increase measure, but it must be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference, the Review Conference, and then to the Legislative Yuan, for review, discussion, and then sent to the Executive Yuan. It is a long journey. By the time the measure is promulgated, won't the teachers be at the end of their rope! After such discussion, November has passed, and the Ministry of Finance is happy to add it from December onwards, adding a "skimming policy" on top of the "starvation policy." This kind of proud masterpiece has been performed many times, and we hope that we will not repeat the same mistakes. (November 25)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Sun Ke Expresses Personal Opinions to American Reporters <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, This City] Sun Ke, the newly appointed Executive Yuan President of China, met with a United Press reporter alone on the 27th and gave a speech, stating that it was his personal opinion. He hoped to form a government representing all levels of the country soon, but did not intend to invite the Communist Party to join the cabinet.</p>
<p>Acquiring Military Aid Policy Will Be Submitted to the Cabinet for Discussion</p>
<p>Sun Ke said: Given the current environment, his government will inevitably reflect American views in some respects. Sun also said: In his personal opinion, China should make reasonable concessions to obtain important American military aid as soon as possible. He plans to submit this policy to the cabinet for discussion. Dr. Sun said: China urgently needs military giants of MacArthur's caliber from the United States to come to China to serve as the supreme military advisor, guide the suppression of the communists, and China is willing to give them full authority. When asked if he agreed to reopen the Yangtze River and other inland rivers for foreign ships to transport goods in and out, Sun replied that he intended to do so. He said: In certain circumstances, US naval vessels can use China's inland rivers based on the opinions of US military advisors. If a policy can be established allowing US warships to patrol the Yangtze River, China will naturally not object. Sun once again emphasized that all his remarks were personal opinions, stating that he agreed to immediately give "new deal" preferential treatment to foreign businesses in Shanghai and other parts of China, reasonably encourage and protect the rights and interests of foreign businesses. He hopes to hold talks with American and other foreign businesses during his stay in Shanghai, and has invited the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to provide suggestions.</p>
<p>If the Communist Party Occupies China, All of Asia Will Be Reddened</p>
<p>Dr. Sun said: He does not believe there is any possibility of negotiating peace with the Chinese Communists, and believes that the war will be fought to the end. He also said that he believes President Chiang is determined to continue fighting at all costs, and the President believes that obtaining large amounts of US aid is highly promising. Sun said that he has not thought about moving the capital to Guangzhou or elsewhere at present. Sun Ke said: There is no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party is part of the world communist movement and closely cooperates with the Soviet Union. If the Communist Party occupies China, the reddening of all of Asia is only a "matter of time", and Japan and the Philippines may also fall into communist hands in the future. Premier Sun said that the Soviet Union's current policy toward China seems to be to immediately establish a strong foothold in the Northeast and actively advance southward. The communist plan does not seem to be to create an independent "Manchukuo" state, as Japan did. On the contrary, Sun said, the Chinese Communist Party may first establish a regime under the name of "People's Democratic Republic of China" to win the favor of the people, and then, after becoming deeply rooted, establish a complete totalitarian government based on the Soviet model.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Opinions on the Berlin Currency Issue, The Four Powers' Reply Officially Announced, Britain, the United States, and France Believe That Separate Negotiations on the Monetary System Are of No Help, Neutral Countries Will Put Forward Another New Proposal <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Security Council will convene on the 29th to study the Berlin issue. According to United Nations sources: The Chairman of the Security Council, Bramuglia, will again submit a new proposal drafted jointly with various neutral countries to the four powers today. This proposal is drafted based on the four powers' replies to his request for opinions on the Berlin currency issue. It is heard that Bramuglia will submit this proposal to the Security Council before he submits it to the new Chairman of the Security Council, Representative Bee, on December 1.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] According to well-informed United Nations sources: The Chairman of the Security Council, Bramuglia, will submit a new proposal on the Berlin issue to the four countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France tomorrow, requesting the latter to submit a reply on Monday. The new method of resolving the Berlin issue contained in the new proposal is the result of detailed research by experts from six neutral countries in the past two days. If the four countries can submit a reply within the specified time, then Bramuglia will convene the Security Council on Monday afternoon or Tuesday to make a decision. It is reported that Bramuglia, who specializes in dealing with the Berlin issue and is acting as the Chairman of the Security Council, will end his appointment on November 30. Tonight, Bramuglia has published the Soviet Union and the opinions of Britain, the United States, and France on the Berlin currency system, as well as the memorandum of the British and French financial experts on this issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The United States, Britain, and France, on the 26th, have in fact closed the door to any possible agreement on the Berlin issue until the Soviet Union is willing to restore the Berlin municipal government under the control of the four powers. The position of the Western three powers was revealed after the four powers announced their replies to the request for opinions submitted by the Chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia. Their replies revealed that the Western powers believed that the Soviet Union had almost completely divided Berlin into two different regions. The Western reply clearly stated that the three powers believed that at a time when the Berlin administration was divided and when the Soviet Union seemed determined to further divide Berlin by any other possible means, even attempting to rebuild a unified Berlin monetary system would be useless. This means that a unified Berlin including all administrative institutions must first be restored before the monetary system can be considered. The Western reply accused the unified administration of Berlin under the control of the four powers of "rapidly disappearing." The Soviet Union's reply to Bramuglia was much simpler than the Western countries' replies. The reply reiterated the Soviet Union's request to implement the Moscow agreement in August as the basis for the four powers to control the Berlin monetary system. According to the Moscow agreement mentioned by the Soviet Union, the acceptance of the Soviet East German mark as the only monetary system in the entire city of Berlin and the Soviet Union's lifting of the blockade of Berlin will be implemented simultaneously. The agreement was issued to the four powers' military chiefs in Germany for implementation, but the Berlin conference was again in a deadlock.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] US Representative Sharpe told reporters today that the United States' acceptance of the idea that the Soviet mark should circulate throughout the Berlin area will never abandon the provisions of the Moscow Agreement in August this year.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The United Nations General Assembly continued to convene this afternoon to review the Greek issue. Representatives from China, Britain, and Greece all spoke, defending the case that the majority of countries supported extending the term of the Balkan Committee and ordering Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to stop assisting the Greek guerrillas. British Representative McNeil said: It only takes an order from the three northern neighbors of Greece to stop all assistance to the Greek guerrillas and prevent the Greek guerrillas from attempting to establish an organization that implements a policy of terror.</p>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris said: The Greek guerrillas are a threat to peace in Southeast Europe and the entire world. The British representative believes that foreign intervention is the main cause of the Greek civil war. He strongly advocated that Greece establish diplomatic relations with its northern neighbors. The Chinese representative expressed support for the majority proposal and said that Greece is a victim of foreign aggression and is enough to threaten world peace.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke for one hour and forty minutes at the UN General Assembly today, attacking the report of the Balkan Investigation Team, accusing it of being a pretext for American and British imperialism to interfere in Greece. After the speech, representatives of the Slavic bloc applauded. Chinese Representative Chiang Tingfu then spoke, supporting the report of the investigation team. He briefly said, "What is imperialism? It is obvious to all. After the Second World War, the United States abandoned the Philippines, and Britain also granted independence to India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon. If the world is only threatened by this kind of imperialism, then the representatives of the UN General Assembly can go home. Give their people the best Christmas gift, world peace, and world security." Chiang's speech won warm applause.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] Yugoslav Representative White today accused the United States of fighting against the Greek people and implementing an economic cold war in Eastern Europe. Some representatives closed their eyes and slept during his loud speech, including British Acting Foreign Minister McNeil. Poland proposed banning one country from imposing economic pressure on another to influence its domestic and foreign policies, thereby condemning the US aid to the European Recovery Program, but was rejected by the General Assembly by a vote of thirty-three to six. Only the Soviet bloc voted in favor, and India, Burma, and the Philippines abstained.</p>

Bramuglia said that some kind of plan will be established for the Berlin issue before the end of the month, but this does not mean that the Berlin issue can be resolved immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The South Korean Government Plans to Ask Our UN General Assembly Delegation to Appeal to the US Military to Stay in South Korea, Lee Beom-seok is Consulting with Our Consul General <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hansong, 27th] A Central News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources that the South Korean government, based on observations of various signs, knows that the US military will withdraw soon, so it plans to ask the Chinese delegation to the UN General Assembly to find a way to allow the United Nations to approve the continued stationing of the US military. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok had a 45-minute meeting with our Consul General Xu Shaochang (who is currently acting as our ambassador to Representative Liu Yuwan) on the afternoon of the 26th. Although the content of the conversation is unknown, it is said that Lee Beom-seok has informed Consul General Xu of this plan, and the latter believes that China may take action according to South Korea's intentions. It is reported that Lee said to our Consul General Xu during the meeting that the US military is preparing to withdraw. But he also said that so far, we cannot say for sure that the country has no intention of staying in South Korea. It is said that Lee Beom-seok has also informed our government of this intention and asked Xu Shaochang and Stuart to relay this intention to our delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. When the United Nations discusses the Korean issue (or even earlier), the South Korean government may reorganize to show the United Nations that the South Korean government under the leadership of Lee Seung-man is making efforts to improve its own organization in order to adapt to the current situation. It is reported that a South Korean official who had just returned from Paris told Lee Seung-man that some representatives in the United Nations had a poor impression of the current South Korean situation, so he advised Lee to reorganize the cabinet as soon as possible. Observers say that if the cabinet is indeed reorganized, at least the three ministers who have been most criticized by all parties (including the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Commerce) will be forced to resign, and Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok may also resign.</p>

News release authorities said that the reports they received this morning were negative, which is understood to mean that the seven war criminals were not hanged last night. Unofficial sources said that they would not be executed this week. If they are not hanged this afternoon, then the seven war criminals can still steal their lives and pass this week. According to American practice, criminals will never be executed on Sundays.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Diplomatic circles said on the 26th that Italy may be invited to join the planned North Atlantic Security Alliance. They said that the treaty with Italy did not stipulate that Italy was prohibited from participating in this treaty. This proposed anti-communist alliance will include the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Some people who advocate this alliance believe that Italy's participation is very important because Italy is located on the flank of France, occupies a strategic position in the Mediterranean, is adjacent to Eastern Europe, and needs to rebuild its armed forces. According to news from Rome, Italy welcomes joining this alliance. Under the treaty, Italy can establish an army of 185,000 people, 65,000 policemen, various aviation personnel not exceeding 2,500 people, 200 heavy and light tanks, and some non-military aircraft. In addition to Italy, it is expected that other countries will also receive invitations, including Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, and Portugal. If these two countries express their willingness to join the alliance in informal negotiations, it is hoped that the invitation will be issued at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 26th] This afternoon, many politicians representing the five countries of France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg met here to hold the first meeting on the establishment of the European Parliament and the International Council of Ministers. For several weeks, representatives of the five countries have reviewed several proposals for the establishment of a European Federation made by various governments and private organizations. It is said that the opinions of Britain and France are very different, while the opinions of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are "between the two major powers." France believes that the European Parliament is only for consultation, while Britain believes that the parliament should not only be a consultation body composed of representatives appointed by various governments, but should also be a regular gathering of ministers from countries willing to join the United States of Europe, and is not limited to the countries that signed the Brussels Convention. Because the opinions of Britain and France are too different, it is said that Belgium and the Netherlands are working to reconcile them.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] According to sources close to the cabinet: When MacArthur met with Shigeru Yoshida last night, he had allowed him to dissolve the Japanese Parliament. It is understood that MacArthur's permission to dissolve the parliament is the main reason for the optimism of government officials, who believe that although the opposition party strongly opposes the current parliament, it will be dissolved soon. It is also learned that MacArthur had requested Shigeru Yoshida to submit a supplementary budget to the parliament to guarantee the minimum salary of civil servants. If this is true, then the opposition party will also be comforted, because the opposition party has insisted on this claim.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Whitney, Director of the Allied Military Government, visited Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida this morning for about 50 minutes.

<p>Employees Not Previously Listed Can Quickly Submit</p>
<p>The Municipal Public and Education Employee Material Supply Committee previously investigated and approved the number of dependents of employees from various units eligible to receive purchase permits. The statistics have long been completed. However, the number of people reported by each beneficiary unit does not align with the number of physical distribution permits. Upon review, more than 7,000 individuals have not been reported. The presumed reasons are: (1) a very small number of units have not yet submitted reports, and (2) single employees without dependents in Shanghai have not reported themselves. As distribution is imminent, in order to safeguard the rights of employees who have not been listed, the supplying unit may still submit a supplementary report by December 5th to avoid missing out. After the deadline, it will be considered a waiver of rights.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Close Supervision of Rice Distribution and Permit Issuance; Inspection Teams Dispatched to Various Districts; Food Adjustment and Allocation Office Explains that Rice Distribution in November is Not a One-Time Exception <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The rice ration permits for November have already been distributed to the citizens of each district by the district offices the day before yesterday. However, citizens did not fully understand the third item in the public announcement of the Food Adjustment and Allocation Office, which states that the November permit issuance is based on the September household registration. According to Han Tingzao, the section chief in charge of the Food Adjustment and Allocation Office, the issuance of rice ration permits has been based on Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations for Metered Rice Rationing in this city since March of this year, which stipulates: "The issuance of rice ration permits shall be based on citizens who have completed household registration procedures legally before the end of the month two months prior, regardless of gender, age, or occupation. Each person shall be issued one permit per month without charge." The reason for relying on household figures from the end of the month two months prior is because the city's household mobility is frequent. The district offices must complete the statistics by the end of the month, which are then forwarded to this office by the Civil Affairs Bureau in the following month. This number is required to print the rice permits for the month after next. Therefore, the November rice permits were printed according to the September household registration and it is not a temporary new measure. As for requiring the new ID card to obtain the rice permit, it is only to demonstrate that the individual is still residing in Shanghai and to prevent unauthorized collection by those who have left the city without reporting it. In order to strictly enforce permit distribution, the office has also invited the US Economic Cooperation Administration China Branch Civil Affairs Bureau and other organizations to form a "Temporary Permit Distribution Inspection Team," which departed yesterday morning to supervise permit distribution in the city's 30 districts. The supervision will continue until the 30th of this month, focusing on (1) whether the permit distribution personnel at all levels are issuing permits in accordance with the prescribed methods, (2) on-site correction and instruction of distribution errors, (3) spot checks to determine whether citizens are collecting multiple permits or fraudulently obtaining permits, (4) spot checks to ensure that the previously issued lists match, (5) attention to irregularities in permit distribution and improvement measures, and (6) whether the number of permits issued to refugees and public households is accurate.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Labor Disputes Are Easing, the Social Affairs Bureau Is Less Crowded; Director Wu Issues a Statement Encouraging Sincere Cooperation Between Management and Capital <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our News] After Mayor Wu and Commander Yi issued a statement prohibiting strikes and work slowdowns during the martial law period, and the municipal government passed three measures for handling labor disputes, labor disputes have begun to ease. Yesterday afternoon, the mediation section of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, which had recently been "overcrowded", was noticeably quieter.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wu, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically issued a statement regarding the handling of labor disputes, sincerely advising all workers: "The Social Affairs Bureau has always cared for workers. In the past, when labor disputes occurred, we have always encouraged management to accept reasonable demands from workers as much as possible, within the ability of the factory to bear and without hindering production order. This is a fact that is commonly seen by the public. However, recently, a small number of workers have been exploited, using the issue of livelihood as an excuse to make excessive demands and launch strikes and work slowdowns, hoping to obstruct production and disrupt social order. This is truly harming the community. During this period of intensified suppression of chaos and the implementation of martial law in the city, Mayor Wu and Commander Yi have announced the strict enforcement of the law. I am afraid that the majority of well-intentioned workers will be exploited and misled, resulting in violations of regulations, causing factory production to halt, leading to unemployment for the majority of good workers, and incurring legal sanctions. I sincerely hope that my fellow workers in the industry deeply understand the difficulties of the times and realize that labor and management must work together in the same boat with sincerity. If there are demands that are reasonable and through legal procedures, I will resolve them in the same spirit as before. Otherwise, violating the law during this period of martial law, even if I want to do my best, I will have no power to assist. I hope that the workers of all industries understand this intention."</p>

After the questioning, the court announced that the debate in this case was concluded and the sentence would be announced at 2:00 PM on the 30th.</p>

Xie Yonghua first presented flowers to the wounded soldiers, and then each person was given a can of food, two packs of cigarettes, and a letter of consolation. At the same time, the representatives wrote letters home on behalf of the wounded soldiers at their request. Although all the wounded officers and soldiers had endured long and arduous journeys, their spirits were very strong. They expressed great emotion for the concern of all sectors of the city and the warmth shown to them. According to Deng Juchen, a company commander of a certain National Army unit who was wounded, the National Army was extremely motivated in the operations around Xuzhou. Every time the bandit army encountered them, they formed an encirclement with several times their numbers. The National Army held their ground, responded calmly, and often went without sleep or food for days and nights. The difficult and arduous conditions, especially the difficulty of obtaining water, were truly heroic and tragic. In the end, they were able to defeat the many with the few. The bandit army mostly hid in various places during the day due to fear of the power of our air force, and then gathered and moved around at night. Their method of attack was to first concentrate artillery fire with flat and curved trajectories, and then launch their so-called "human wave tactics," driving soldiers to charge. According to Company Commander Deng, during the bandit's charge, our heavy and light machine guns often fired non-stop for three or four hours, which can be imagined to be extremely brutal. Each time, the bandit army's corpses piled up like mountains, and we often captured more than 500 machine guns in one battle. Because our fortifications were solid, our losses were minimal. At the same time, the general education level of the National Army was very high and their faith was firm. Even if they fell into the hands of the bandits and were forced to make a "counter-attack," they all resolutely refused, preferring to be killed. Therefore, the bandits were always deeply afraid of our army and dared not look them in the eye.</p>
<p>Hard Work in Comforting Troops; President Commends Fang Zhi</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Since its establishment, the Committee for Comforting Soldiers Fighting the Rebellion in Shanghai has worked extraordinarily hard under the leadership of Director Fang. It has successively received and comforted hundreds of thousands of soldiers and wounded officers and soldiers passing through the city. During the retreat from the Northeast and the outbreak of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, the number of soldiers passing through the city increased. The committee launched a large-scale fundraising campaign. In addition to personally or sending representatives to comfort the troops passing through and sending them comfort items such as cigarettes, canned goods, and newspapers, it also invited famous artists from Shanghai's entertainment industry to perform various shows at any time to provide spiritual comfort. At the same time, it organized a comfort delegation to visit the Xuzhou area to comfort the troops. It has made many contributions to encouraging morale and enhancing the strength of the campaign to suppress the rebellion. The highest authorities specially sent a telegram to commend them. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Urgent, Director Fang Xikong of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, and to all comrades: It is learned that the department has made great efforts in comforting and receiving soldiers passing through the city, which is highly commendable. I hope you will continue your efforts. Chiang Kai-shek, Secret Office of the President, sealed."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Calm and Composed, Without Any Sign of Grief <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The three defendants Chen Yuansheng, Wang Hailiang, and Jiang Jixiang were all wearing black cotton winter casual clothes, with thick eyebrows and large eyes. They were calm and composed in court, without any sign of grief, and whispered to each other, occasionally showing smiles. Their testimonies were similar. They all stated that life in prison was very difficult. Liu Ali, who was in the same cell, proposed a way to escape. Wang Hailiang obtained a hacksaw from foreign prisoners outside the prison and obtained a large number of gauze bandages from the prison infirmary, which were made into ropes. At around 2:00 AM on August 23rd, during a heavy rain, they sawed through the iron bars of the wall window and then climbed down the ropes. They then took advantage of the opportunity to escape. They then took a car from the Huade Automobile Company across from the Shanghai Prison to Shiliupu, where they bought a boat to cross the river to Jiang Jixiang's home in Pudong. Jiang's wife, Zhao Ruizhen, gave them 10 million legal tender and a gold ring. After mortgaging the gold ring for 20 gold yuan at the home of Jiang's cousin Jiang Shengfa, the three then separated. Liu Ali strongly denied that he initiated the escape, as Chen and others stated, claiming that he had heard that an amnesty was imminent and that his sentence was about to expire, so he did not want to escape. After each of the other defendants was questioned one by one, the court immediately announced the sentence as above. When the defendants Chen Yuansheng and others were returned to prison, they were all shackled, with many bailiffs temporarily taking care of them in court.</p>

<p>Wang Chunzhe, the general manager of Lin Wang Company, who had been sentenced to death by the Special Criminal Court and executed by firing squad, and his cousin Zheng Jiayu, the deputy manager of the company, had already been arrested by the police.

After Wang Chunzhe was executed, his will stated that Zheng was actually the main culprit in the case. At this time, Zheng had already fled to Hong Kong.

<h3 id="e101">Restrictions on Remittances Between Shanghai and Guangzhou Reinstated; High-Interest Deposits in Banks and Firms to Be Inspected <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>It has been learned from financial authorities that the authorities have decided to re-enforce restrictions on remittances and cash transfers between Shanghai and Guangzhou. The maximum amount that each traveler or remitter can send from Shanghai is RMB 1,000 per day. The maximum amount that each bank or firm can remit to Guangzhou is RMB 100,000 per day. Each bank and firm must submit a report on their remittances to Guangzhou to the financial authorities every day after business hours in the afternoon. It is reported that this measure will also be implemented in Hankou at the same time, with a limit of half that of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Also, the financial management authorities have been paying close attention to the recent practice of commercial banks competing to attract deposits with high interest rates. According to a person in charge of the bureau, the bureau will send personnel to various banks and firms at any time it deems necessary to inspect their deposit ledgers.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates in High Demand <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates remained very firm due to the influence of the previous day's strength. Export transfer certificates were priced at $29 and overseas remittance transfer certificates at $52, but trading volume was low.</p>
<p>Exporters believe that this situation is due to (1) the issuance of import permits by the Import-Export Control Commission some days ago, and (2) the rise in the black market price of US dollars in recent days. However, they pointed out that this price is still far from the actual market price, so they hope that the import and export linkage measures under consideration can be finalized and announced as soon as possible so that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates can return to normal.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Rumor of Gold Price Adjustment Denied by National Bank <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, rumors spread that the government would adjust the deposit exchange rate starting next week, so the number of people lining up to withdraw money at the four designated banks increased even more. A reporter from the United Credit Investigation Office specifically visited a person in charge of the business bureau of the Central Bank for this matter. According to them, although the matter was ordered by the government, in view of the current situation, the adjustment rumor is believed to be completely unfounded. They also believed that this rumor may have been deliberately released by gold and currency black marketeers or speculators to achieve their goal of obtaining windfall profits.</p>

<p>Focus on Foreign Exchange Control Issues</p>
<p>According to news from the Import-Export Control Commission, although the Ministry of Finance appointed Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Monetary Affairs Department, and Cheng Dacheng, Counselor, to come to Shanghai to discuss the detailed implementation measures of the import and export linkage system, Wu was unable to leave Beijing due to unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, only Cheng came to Shanghai the other day. After contacting the relevant parties such as the Import-Export Control Commission and the Central Bank, it was decided to move the meeting to Beijing because several important issues required further instructions from the central government. The Import-Export Control Commission has also appointed Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Department, to attend as a representative, and Chen left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday morning.</p>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Commission, the reason why the implementation measures cannot be decided at present is mostly due to the issue of foreign exchange control, rather than the technical issue of import and export control. However, they believed that a decision might be reached at the Nanjing meeting this time.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Rice Prices Decline Again; Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes Rise Slightly <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The rice market still showed no signs of improvement, and prices fell again yesterday. Although arrivals have decreased slightly, the outflow is still sluggish, and sales are still sluggish.

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was weak because prices had risen too high for several consecutive days, and people were thinking about risks at high prices. Also, it was Saturday, and many retail bulls took profits.

<p>The fabric market was sluggish because actual sales were still sluggish. Customers' willingness to purchase was weak due to high prices. Twelve-yard Longtou fine cloth initially called for a firm price of $15, but at noon it fell back to $405 at the close, a rise of $10 from the previous day, but it was heard after the close that there were sellers at $395, and finally a transaction was made at $410.

<p>Yesterday, rayon stopped rising and turned to falling. The money supply in the market tightened, dark interest rates rose, and retail investors outside the industry kept selling. Sentiment was weak, and prices fell steadily. The initial price of 120-count Tianqiao was $12,500. Many people rushed to sell. Customers' willingness to purchase was weak, and the market collapsed. Prices fell in a straight line to $11,800. The silk weaving industry on this street made sporadic purchases, but those who needed it had already gathered enough money. The willingness to sell was slightly relaxed, and the market improved slightly after being soft, closing at $11,900. The price of Dongyang closed at $12,500, a drop of $500 from the previous day's noon closing price. Yesterday, the silk market was also weak and could not rise. Industry demand was very low, and everyone wanted to sell goods for cash. The market was defeated and prices also fell back. The morning opening price of D-grade 7878 evenness was $14,000, but no one asked about it after the call. The spot price of superior grade retail was called $13,300.

<p>The foreign tea market, which has been quiet for a long time, did not break through yesterday. The holders of various export box teas such as Tunluo were still stubborn and unwilling to sell easily, while exporters continued to hold back. Transactions stagnated again, and the process was extremely lonely. According to this situation, it is quite difficult to become optimistic for a while. As for domestic tea, there were both inflows and outflows, and the trend was still active. The opening price was also firm because there were many people selling.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Timber Weak <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The timber market has been weak for the past half month. Since the implementation of price controls on timber, all parties have come to rush to buy it, resulting in wholesale shops losing almost half of their inventory. When the price controls were lifted, construction business plummeted due to the tense situation.

<p>Increase to 3,600 Tons Per Quarter</p>
<p>Taiwan Alkali Corporation has formulated a production increase plan. By the end of this year, the quarterly production will be 3,600 tons of alkali (currently 1,500 tons per quarter). According to industry insiders, the total amount required by various industries is more than 7,800 tons per quarter. The current quarterly output of each domestic producer using the electrolysis method is more than 3,300 tons. In addition, there is about 1,700 tons of caustic soda made from pure alkali and lime per quarter. The shortfall is about 2,800 tons. If each electrochemical plant can further increase its power and implement a production increase plan, and supplement it with caustic soda made from pure alkali and lime, the caustic soda problem in the chemical industry can be self-sufficient at a minimum and has a bright future.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Villagers Attack in Chenjiaqiao, Wuxi; Henan Joint High School Destroyed; Dozens of Students Killed and Injured <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Special Correspondent Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>[This newspaper Wuxi 25th fast news] An organized vicious case occurred in Chenjiaqiao, about twelve miles north of Wuxi, at eight o'clock this morning. Six to seven hundred villagers participated in the case, and the newly established Henan Joint High School in the village was destroyed. Thirty-eight students of the school were injured, and twenty-seven students were beaten by villagers holding guns and sticks, then tied up and thrown into the river. Their survival is unknown. When the atrocities were carried out, the students were chased by the villagers, like lambs encountering wolves. The cries for help could be heard for several miles. The school has a total of 1,192 students, all junior high school students who fled south from Henan. Their ages are all around sixteen or seventeen. Each person is issued 20 taels of rice and 3.5 cents for non-staple food by the school every day. Since the lifting of price controls at the beginning of this month, the students' non-staple food expenses are not enough for oil and salt alone. Due to the extreme shortage of firewood in the area, the students' non-staple food expenses for the whole month are not enough to buy half a burden of rice straw. The students have no choice but to pick up firewood themselves. There have been occasional verbal disputes with the villagers due to the students breaking off dry branches of mulberry and willow trees, but because the school authorities are strict, no unfortunate incidents have occurred so far. Unexpectedly, at around eight o'clock this morning, a student had a dispute with the owner of a pancake shop in Chenjiaqiao when buying pancakes. Teachers and staff in the school immediately rushed to dissuade them after hearing the news. The villagers who were watching actually pulled out</p>
<p>Gun Threat</p>
<p>At the same time, they also rang gongs and shouted, gathering people to beat them. At one time, hundreds of villagers, led and incited by a few people, swarmed to the school office and started fighting, destroying all doors, windows, tables, chairs, documents and office supplies. The director of the school, Wang Junjie, and teachers came forward to comfort them, but were also beaten. Hu Qian, the district chief of Zhang Village, which is next to the school, was also present, but did not take appropriate measures to stop the riots. In addition, students living in Youjia Ancestral Hall, Wujia Ancestral Hall, and Wangjiadang, four or five miles away from the village, were also systematically beaten by the villagers at the same time. The scale was large and the situation was more tragic than Chenjiaqiao. The students in each place were caught off guard and had no defense, so they were all beaten. The villagers in Wujia Ancestral Hall surrounded the student dormitories, and also went up to the roof to tear down the houses, throwing bricks and stones at the students, and planned to set fire to the dormitories, but they were spared because the nearby women begged for mercy. Occasionally, a few students fled into the wilderness, but they were chased and beaten by groups of villagers. Hundreds of villagers in Wangjiadang, after beating the students severely, tied up 27 students including Fu Helili with ropes and threw them into the river. Because the river was too deep, except for Fu Helili, who swam out because he was familiar with the water, the other 26 people have not been rescued by the evening. It is also heard that some students in Youjia Ancestral Hall and scattered students were also thrown into the river and buried alive. Because the order has not yet been restored, it is still impossible to investigate how many students died. Thirty-eight injured students have now been identified, and no villagers have been injured or killed. Because the students are under the strict control of the school, they have not resisted so far, so a more unfortunate fight has not occurred. After the incident, Ye Zhaoxing, Director of the Political Work Department of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, Section Chief Mu Yue, Liu Younong, Supervisor of the Wuxi City Defense Headquarters, Zhu Yabo, Captain of the Second Brigade of the Wuxi County Government Security Police, etc., were ordered to lead troops, police and medical personnel to the scene at 12:00 noon to suppress the investigation. Ye and others were extremely heartbroken to see the destruction of the school and the young refugee students with broken heads, bleeding, broken arms and legs. In addition to ordering 23 seriously injured students to be sent to the city for hospitalization, they immediately reprimanded Chief Hu, who was negligent in prevention in advance and failed to stop the riots in time, and limited him to immediately capture the ringleaders. Chief Hu was afraid of the difficulty and shirked his responsibility. It was not until dusk that he handed over two people to the city for interrogation. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again that night, Chief Hu also made a guarantee to the responsible authorities to ensure the safety of the school staff and students. A storm finally subsided temporarily. According to a post-event investigation, this atrocity has a political background. Gao, a gentry in the village, was forced by the crowd during the assault and refused to comply, which resulted in his home also being destroyed. This matter is still developing, and it is hoped that the relevant authorities will quickly seek a reasonable and legal solution to maintain the security of the rear.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Public Sentiment <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>In the recent U.S. election, President Truman's re-election was an unexpected outcome. Not only did those like Dewey, who were confident of victory beforehand, feel surprised, but even several so-called public opinion organizations known for conducting "public opinion polls" were left speechless. The only explanation heard today is that a shift in American public sentiment led to Truman's victory.</p>
<p>Who becomes the American president is an American affair. However, given the disadvantageous position Mr. Truman was in at the time, his ability to achieve such an overwhelming victory undeniably includes the factor of public sentiment. Although America has the stronghold of Wall Street, it is, after all, the most democratic country in the modern world, and the power of public sentiment can play a decisive role in politics.</p>
<p>But what exactly is public sentiment or the human heart? There's a saying in our common parlance, "Every heart is different, just like every face," indicating that the human heart is the most elusive thing. The branch of psychology dealing with crowd psychology is likely studying this public sentiment or human heart. However, I personally believe that someone deeply versed in crowd psychology isn't necessarily someone who can deeply win the hearts of the people. A politician skilled in political maneuvering naturally understands how to grasp crowd psychology, but they may not necessarily be able to grasp genuine public sentiment. This is because crowd psychology belongs to technique, while public sentiment belongs to morality.</p>
<p>Someone who can win the hearts of the people and also grasp crowd psychology will naturally be sure to win. However, relying solely on the use of crowd psychology may sometimes achieve success, but the lifespan of such success will not be long. Most of the treacherous officials throughout history were able to use crowd psychology, but they were ultimately just treacherous officials. Hitler and Mussolini are typical examples of this.</p>
<p>Then what exactly is public sentiment? How can public opinion be grasped? Although I am not a psychologist, I dare to compare public sentiment to flowing water. It can flow with the current, it can flow against the current, and sometimes it even breaks through. It can lift a person to the highest heavens, and it can also send the same person to the deepest hell. During the French Revolution of the 18th century, several figures who were considered heroes of their time by the people were sent to the guillotine by the same "public sentiment." The elusiveness of public sentiment is truly awe-inspiring. In Ibsen's play "An Enemy of the People," the blind side of public sentiment was satirically depicted.</p>
<p>Originally, although public sentiment is an irresistible force, it is not the most reliable, because it is a mixed product of reason and emotion. Sometimes it may become a final judgment of a trend, but sometimes it is just a blind force that can lead astray. The unreliability of public opinion polls is due to this reason.</p>
<p>However, public sentiment or the human heart does exist, and it does have a decisive force. It truly possesses the power of "those who obey me prosper, those who oppose me perish." Although it is an abstract existence, it can change trends on a small scale and create history on a large scale. It can create and it can destroy. The question is how to grasp public sentiment and how to use the human heart. The ancient saying "those who follow Heaven prosper" is, in fact, simply teaching people how to grasp public sentiment.</p>
<p>Because public sentiment is not entirely reliable, grasping it requires great wisdom and insight. In other words, grasping public sentiment is not about simply conforming to it, but rather about focusing on appropriate guidance. I once said that public sentiment is like flowing water. Going with the flow is sometimes a good way to conform to public opinion, but the most important thing is to be able to see the source of the water clearly and guide it. If you ask where the source of public sentiment lies, I would answer, "fairness."</p>
<p>"Fairness resides in the hearts of the people" is a very common saying, but precisely because it is so common, it represents a truth. Are our social facilities in accordance with fairness? Are our political systems in accordance with fairness? Are our economic policies in accordance with fairness? The question of where the human heart is heading depends on this answer of fairness.</p>
<p>Now, people are often heard calling for winning back public sentiment, but in my opinion, lost public sentiment is like spilled water that is difficult to recover. It would be better to rebuild fairness to revitalize public sentiment, which is the fundamental solution.</p>

<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Heavy words of farewell, the lamp dim, how can the wild pass tolerate weary birds flying? Borrowing chopsticks to first plan the fundamental strategy, getting out of the carriage to see the city gate isn't what it was; A clean cup breaks the vow as the sky first cools, in my prime, following the green temple is something to rely on (residing at the Wisdom Sun Nunnery), do not say that the kasaya is tightly tied with sorrow, opening the chest there's still old cotton clothing.</p>
<p>A hungry ox overturns the carriage, and wild geese cry in the marsh, who is making injustice in this world! There should be no dream of firewood and gall to change the world, there are many children and soldiers in famous mountains; Feeding chestnuts in front of the chest, the monkey is hard to trust, after illness, returning home at night is easy to be startled, getting up to listen to the branches of the trees, the wind hasn't stopped, the leaves flutter, making sounds of resentment and parting.</p>
<p>The Yellow Bamboo Shore is deep, swallowing the evening tide, the abandoned Martyr Altar (on the peak of Dragon Spring Mountain) is covered in tall artemisia, instead I lead my wife and children to live in confusion, how dare I say that talent is gradually declining? With what heart do I endure this age of calamity, the southeast at this time enters despair, fat frost makes a ball like the autumn moon, there's still clear light wanting to soak my waist.</p>
<p>Cooking smoke from the roof gives birth to warmth, now I know that in this floating world, being full is supreme, resigned to wasting my mind and strength for rice and salt, I can't bear to see Xu and Si connected by the marks of war! My life is nothing more than the suffering of sleeplessness, sacred places have each survived hundreds of battles, could there be immortal monkeys in the green bamboo, would buddhas come to discuss with the pedantic scholar?</p>

<p>— He Ku</p>
<p>Recently, when reading the newspaper, apart from advertisements and supplements, most of the domestic and foreign dispatches and local news are things that make one frown. However, among the news that makes one frown, from a writer's point of view, I have read several good articles.</p>
<p>For example, one good article is MacArthur's ruling on the Tokyo criminals. There must be a skilled writer in MacArthur's administration. This skilled writer is able to avoid official jargon in solemn documents and apply the colors of emotion everywhere, which is a strength uniquely lacking among the secretaries in our government administrations. I still remember MacArthur's speech when he first arrived in Tokyo and accepted the surrender, beginning with, "From Pearl Harbor to Tokyo, a long journey, we have finally arrived." A feeling of reflecting on the past and looking at the present leaps off the page.</p>
<p>The ruling issued by MacArthur this time is also like this. The beginning of the ruling is like this: "In my floating career, I have encountered many unsatisfactory things, but what my heart least desires but must do is first and foremost reviewing the sentences of the Japanese war criminals convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East." His humble and unwilling feelings almost make us disbelieve that it comes from the pen of a commander who once dominated the world! Today, most people in the world believe that MacArthur's control over Japan is too lenient. This argument relates to the global situation and is not something this small article dares to discuss. However, his ability to set aside arrogance and not take revenge as the victor, his broad-mindedness, is worthy of the world's contemplation. And look at MacArthur's attitude toward the verdict: "What is decided by humans can never be without error. However, I know that I am sincerely unable to find a better method than this trial to clarify justice and fairness… However, the evolution of modern society is not yet complete, and there is no other institution more qualified and confident to issue this solemn verdict." His starting point for agreeing with the International Military Tribunal's verdict is based on the above reasons.</p>
<p>Regarding the purpose of executing the grand trial and sentencing, MacArthur's intention is to "show all good people in the world that war is useless and is only the greatest sin of mankind and the most despicable disaster, and to enlighten all countries in the world to collectively abandon war." This is the only official cliché that MacArthur's ruling reveals. Because "all good people in the world" already know the uselessness of war, but they still cannot escape this "despicable disaster." This "greatest sin" is still being constantly created or carried out. Is it really because, as MacArthur said, "the evolution of modern society is not yet complete"?</p>
<p>Finally, what should be mentioned is that this United Press dispatch translation is indeed elegant and accurate, able to convey the spirit of the original dispatch in another language in a roundabout way. As soon as we compare it to the original, we can know the difficulty of translating this dispatch, and this Chinese dispatch published in major newspapers is, of course, the most satisfying one.</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I'd like to point out one thing. The Chinese opening of the dispatch is "In my floating career," and the original text is In long public service. MacArthur is an active-duty soldier, which doesn't seem to match the Chinese "floating career," and the words "floating" are merely an idiom, with no original text to refer back to. In my opinion, it should be changed to "I have been in the military for a long time," but this is close to nitpicking, because in the rush to translate many dispatches, you can't chew on words like this.</p>

<p>— Kuan Nai</p>
<p>In World War II, General Eisenhower led the Allied forces, attacking North Africa, attacking Sicily, landing in Italy, landing in France, liberating all of Europe, and defeating countless famous German generals. It can truly be said that his achievements are unparalleled and his name will be remembered forever. No wonder many people wanted to invite him to run for president before the recent U.S. election. Here are two small examples that can show us his insight.</p>
<p>During the landing battle in Italy, the American army received information that German generals were intensifying propaganda, exaggerating the results of the battle, in order to encourage morale.</p>
<p>General Eisenhower, however, said: "They are exaggerating their victory, but we must never exaggerate. We must never allow our country to have a wrong feeling that our victory is an easy matter. The only thing created by this illusion is excessive optimism, and excessive optimism often turns into excessive pessimism when encountering setbacks. Excessive optimism is useless, and excessive pessimism is very harmful."</p>
<p>Therefore, even though Eisenhower knew that he had achieved initial success when the Allied forces successfully landed in France, he repeatedly emphasized to reporters that the future of the war would inevitably be difficult and that the military and civilians of the whole country must intensify their efforts - without a single word of complacency!</p>
<p>Another time, it was when the Allied forces were approaching Berlin, but then turned to advance southeast. His decision not to occupy Berlin was strongly criticized by American newspapers, which believed that a great opportunity had been lost. But Eisenhower said that the purpose of the battle was to defeat the enemy's military strength and end the war as soon as possible. At that time, the German army claimed to have a strong army in the southeast, called the "national fortress," and the Allied forces certainly could not clear this obstacle before first clearing this resistance for the sake of a city. As for Berlin, although gaining it would make big headlines in the newspapers, he said, "We are not fighting for big headlines."</p>
<p>Eisenhower's success was not accidental!</p>
