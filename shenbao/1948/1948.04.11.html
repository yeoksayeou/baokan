<p>〔本報紐約九日電〕孔祥熙九日下午三時半晋謁杜魯門總統，由美總統在白宮接見。孔氏此次晋謁杜魯門之性質，未能確定，據孔氏事後語記者稱：此次拜會，純屬私人事件，但孔氏之拜會，旣正式在白宮紀事中刋載，而談話時間亦超出普通拜會，故多數人均以爲必曾涉及中國重要問題。白宮記者對孔氏表示歡迎，彼等對孔氏此次拜會美總統，頗多猜測，但若干人認爲：孔氏旣係中國領導政治家，則會晤總統，亦屬意中之事。另據聯合社華盛頓九日電稱，孔祥熙吿記者，晤美總統時，曾申謝對華援助。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓九日合衆電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞，頃訪晤美代理國務卿洛維特，討論「履行援華方案」。顧大使事後吿記者稱，中國方面極願援華方案儘早付諸實施，渠曾以此意通知洛維特。顧氏繼稱：中國尙未發出有關表示願意遵守美援計劃中所規定條件之函件，蓋美國務院仍未通知中國關於此項函件應採用何種形式也。然美方之通知不日即可發出，而中國亦將及時提出此項函件。中國駐美技術代表團長貝祖詒，此次亦陪同顧大使訪晤洛維特。按貝氏及其團員過去數月來，係在此與美方磋商中國復興方案細節。據貝氏稱：渠「不久」即將返華。又中國前財長孔祥熙曾往訪杜魯門總統，會談歷廿分鐘，孔氏謂，此次拜訪「純爲私人性質」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕洛維特稱：顧大使等之訪晤，乃爲討論「實施援華計劃」。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓九日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞博士本日稱：在援華方案實行開始以前，中國政府將提出「意見書」。渠稱：軍事援助一億二千五百萬美元及經濟援助三億三千八百萬美元，將儘速生效。又稱：在枝節問題未同意以前，預料並不立即交付物資。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕第一届國大第一次會議，將於廿四日下午閉幕，惟議程是否能如期完畢，將視下兩週開會情形而定。十日下午第五次大會通過之日程表，規定十一日（星期日）休息。十二日至十四日上下午大會，由政府負責當局分三日報吿軍事·經濟·政治·報吿後即進行檢討。十四日公吿總統候選人，同日十二時截止收受有關修改憲法之提案。十五日上午大會討論憲法修改案（一讀），下午爲政府對各項檢討之答覆。十六日上下午審査會，審查憲法修正案。十七日上下午大會討論憲法修正案，完成二讀·三讀程序，同日中午十二時截止收受一般提案。十八日休息。十九日上午大會選舉總統，同時公吿副總統候選人。廿日上下午審查會，審査一般提案·廿一·廿二兩日上下午均開大會，討論提案，廿三日上午選舉副總統，廿四日上午大會，致送總統當選證書，下午閉幕。</p>
<h3 id="c3">討論日程表草案　會塲情形混亂幾至動武 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕國大第五次會‘議討論會議日程表草案，會塲情形空前混亂，會議於上午九時廿分開始，出席代表二〇九〇人，主席團第七組輪値主持，由薛篤弼主席，首通過上次會議紀錄，繼聽取白崇禧報吿奉主席團命與傅作義將軍通話經過，並決定仍由大會名義電慰。九時四十五分薛主席宣布討論會議日程表草案，豫區代表周炎光等相繼提出意見，咸認每次會議檢討國是之前，應由各院部會長列席，分別提出報吿聆聽檢討，答覆質詢，未幾，因周炎光口頭說明意見時觸及蔣主席九日之報吿以限於資料及時間，尙覺有不够盡詳之處，招致一部會衆公憤，以哄亂制止周氏發言，幾至動武，另有若干代表則不平反對，會塲因之紊亂不堪，幸經薛主席引用議事規則第五十九條，亟力提醒出席代表于有共同維護會塲秩序之責任，經多數代表鼓掌響應，會塲方重趨安定，軒然大波乃告平息，周氏重述其分門別類聽取報吿進行國是檢討之主張，並申明渠對蔣主席，報吿之意見乃出於愛戴將主席而發，不意竟爲同人誤會。旋蘇區代表朱煥彪提出總統。副總統連署提名期限及選舉日期依法應由大會討論決定，然後方能排入日程，浙區代表李園提議，會議日程應擴展時日，俾有充裕時間處理提案，多數代表並引述議事規則第五十三條修　議程在選舉前由大會決定之規定，主張選舉應移後在提案議畢後進行，亦有一部代表主張應增列在選舉前候選人須出席大會發表競選演說之議程，新疆代表並由吳鐵庫爾作開會來首次發言，主張修憲議程應有較長時間，蒙藏委員會主管亦就出席大會，對處理邊胞事務作施政報吿，十時四十五分休息，十一時十分續會，由副秘書長劉東岩宣讀十餘書面意見後，婦團代表劉宦（祝紹周夫人）聲明準備受噓後發言，伊力闢衆議，指會衆於糊裏糊塗之際已自作超出憲法範圍之決議，國大並非參政會，不應有例行之施政報吿，一部會衆立即鼓噪噓嘶，欲以哄亂壓止其發言，當此舉立即引起婦女代表及若干男代表之憤怒，伊乃於公正支持下獲得薛主席許可，重登發言臺陳述其全部意見，至十二時於哄亂中散會</p>
<h3 id="c4">白崇禧全體　守方鋼是維秩序 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>下午三時四十分繼續開會，白崇禧主席，報吿主席團交下女代表章繩以等請求保障女代表在會塲發言自由之書面意見後，復以代表身分指陳：言論自由爲民主政治之基礎，願全體同人深體此旨，遵守議則，維持秩序，尊重每一代表之發言權，爲國家憲政樹立楷模。繼由副秘書長劉東岩宣讀各代表對會議日程表草案之書面意見，大致均與午前所提出雷同。宣讀畢，黔區代表谷正綱發言，略稱：午前會中各代表之意見集中兩點，一爲檢討國是之前，須聽政府長官施政報吿，一爲選舉總統。副總統之議程，應排在憲法修改案討論決定之後。然渠以爲檢討國是應注重檢討二字，不可如過去之參政會，遭受政府長官之疲勞轟炸。國大雖爲代表人民行使政權之最高機關，但實際上部分政權已歸由立法院行使。根據憲法，行政院對立法院負責，行政長官是否一定接受國大之決定，値得考慮。渠謂：守法即是民主，而戡亂。行憲兩事，實爲最重要之國是，至於選舉與修憲議程之次序，渠主配合進行，至遲應於廿五日前使大會閉幕。</p>
<h3 id="c5">「拖延浪費」　有背戡亂目標 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>渠認爲：會期拖延一日，不但國家財富損耗重大，且予共匪作亂機會，現平·蓉兩地學潮又起，當地各部門主要負責人之離職赴會，頗有關係，此足證明不必要之拖延浪費，實與戡亂目標相背，渠建議由主席團開會，融合各代表意見，將日程表重行修訂，於休息後提出大會取決，此建議當經會衆鼓掌同意，白主席乃於四時十五分宣吿休息。</p>
<h3 id="c6">有關程序問題　業經處理完竣 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>四時四十分續會，由秘書長洪關友宣讀修正草案後，並報吿主席團歸納採取之修正意見五點：（一）檢討國是，在聽取政府長官報吿之後，歸納各種意見，分爲軍事，經濟及政治三大部份，分三日進行，而於第四日由政府對各項檢討作答。（二）憲法修改案之討論議程移在總統。副總統選舉之前。（三）總統·副總統選舉之候選人提名及公吿兩程序，應與一般議程配合，依法早日進行。（四）提案截止日期，自當日起算足一週，至十七日午十二時截止，但憲法修改案因須提前討論，亦提前至十四日午十二時截止。（五）會期酌予延長兩日，至廿四日止。報吿後，洪氏復就朱炳彪之質疑解釋總統。副總統候選人之提名以公吿日爲截止期，白主席即以此修訂後之草案付諸表決，表決器上燦爛空前，在塲代表一八三七人，贊成者一八一七人，此案終得於百分之九十八點九以上出席代表之擁護而通過，使有關會議之程序問題，終於開幕十二日後處理完畢。最後劉東岩報吿河南代表所提，請轉政府軍事當局迅派大軍增援中原，確保鄭。汴之動議，業經主席團飭秘書處迅辦，五時十分宣吿散會。</p>
<h3 id="c7">新疆國代發言　博得熱烈掌聲 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕新疆代表十日晨在國大會塲中作首次發言，現任維哈文報總編輯之哈什縣代表吳鐵庫爾以維語致詞，由鎭優縣代表涂樂幹担任繙譯，提出兩點意見，一爲憲法乃民主政洽之基礎，而邊疆同胞來京集會不易，關於修憲議案之討論應有充分時間，一爲蒙藏會對邊務之施政應向大會報吿，中央對新疆雖亦關懷，但仍乏優遇，以慰新疆同胞之忠於國家。渠並强調聲稱：「新疆是國家在西北的重要門戶，沒有新疆便沒有西北，沒有西北也便沒有國家」。於熱烈鼓掌聲中結束其發言。</p>

<p>女代表說：「我們代表諸君太太發言，請勿給予藐視的噓聲！」</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕會塲情形和天氣一樣，一度晴朗一陣雲，蔣主席說「絕不能鬧笑話給共匪」，言猶在耳，十日大會却因日程問題，又引起一塲風波，且已進了外國記者的鏡頭。</p>
<p>今天上午的大會主席是老好人薛篤弼，對控制混亂的會塲頗感棘手，慰問傳作義的掌聲纔了，責備周炎光代表的噓聲大作。討論大會日程表上沒有施政報吿以及把選舉放在修改憲法之前，都使代表們容忍不住，發言者的要求大致是先行繼續其他施政報吿，再檢討，修憲，然後辦選舉；儘管憲法賦予大會的職權並沒有「報告」與「檢討」而大衆的意見却要如此，明事理者衹好默不作聲。周炎光原持同一論調，衹怪他說話技術不佳，以致横生枝節。他的本意可能是「對蔣主席的報吿尙感不够詳盡」，說出來時却是「對蔣主廣的報吿不滿意」。這句話燃着了火藥庫，會塲中噓聲四起，有人喊「不准他說」，有人喊「打共產黨」，人羣包圍了甬道上。麥克風前的周炎光嚇得面無人色，薛篤弼和洪蘭友力勸大家請坐，而會塲中仍是一團糟；好容易平靜下來，讓周炎光有機會說完他的修正意見，並解釋方才那句話引起的誤會，但休息前後，發言者的意見幾乎千篇一律，仍要先「報吿」，「檢討」，「修憲」，最後再行選舉。祝紹周夫人劉宦代表，不因爲她是女人而减少勇氣，時間已十一時半，麥克風中傳出了她織細的聲調：「我知道我的意見會被大家噓，可是我希望等我說完了再噓」。她發表她的反對論，指出「報吿」和「檢討」溢出憲法的範圍，但她的聲音不能糾正道一錯誤，反而引起了排斥，當他祗說了一小段時，噓聲和叫囂便籠覃了整個會塲，她被迫下台，又被女代表鼓勵，而重上發言臺，旋又下台，如是者，好幾次；她終于再度發言了，樓上樓下的叫吵，己掩沒了她的聲浪。薛篤弼，洪蘭友的制止無效，一任混亂，達十分鐘之久，新聞記者竄來竄去，劉宦成了鏡箱的好對象，雖然有人喊「少說幾句」，劉宦終于說完了沒有人能聽得到的話纔下台；章繩以女代表挺身登台，以弱者的姿態呼籲，女代表所代表的人數較多，責任比男代表大，希望別給予藐視的噓聲。她的結論是：「女代表們發言，即是代表你們諸位最親愛的太太發言」。這一下引起了全塲哄笑和掌聲，空氣較鬆懈了一點，但已届法定散會時間了。人們似乎在獲得發洩後情緒便平定一點。下午開會時情形較好，主席白崇禧戎裝蒞塲，谷正綱一席話痛快而舒服，他希望大會能創立民主，守法作風，主張一面修憲，一面選舉，這是今天會中唯一可以使大家一致擁護的意見，只有樓上一代表反對，他說：「一定要先修憲後選舉，否則選舉完了，代表們走掉不足法定人數，憲法就修改不成了」，可是　　這意見敵不住久亂思靜的會衆情緒，白崇禧宣布由主席團歸納大家意見再提修正案，全體一致贊成。</p>
<p>休息過後，新日程表順利通過。這是一天的成就，一陣風雨換來一張日程表，回顧大會則已足足開了兩週了。（四月十日於南京）</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕今日上午之會可謂一種「反噓鬥爭」，「民主是容納反對者充分發言的政治制度」，此一呼聲，到今天才聽到，予識者以「空谷足音」之感。</p>

<h3 id="c15">星期論壇　解釋土地改革方案　並答覆吳景超先生等 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭錚</p>
<p>自中國土地改革協會，發表了土地改革方案後，國內外報章雜誌，紛加贊揚，並承著論指敎，深爲感奮。尤以最近南京中央日報吳景超先生「評土地改革方案」一文，爲比較明顯之疑問，友人間來書，亦常以吳先生所致疑者相詢，茲謹將原方案主要各點分別解答如次：</p>
<p>（一）本方案擬訂主旨，在以最明快簡捷的方法，解決中國最嚴重的佃農要求土地的問題。佃耕制度，在中國是最普遍亦最爲危害的制度，它不僅使多數農民生活貧困，而且使土地的收穫量也逐漸在那裏减少。本會鑒於過去所擬「稅去地主」的方案，旣屬緩不濟急，而以發行債劵「買去地主」的方法，亦實迂緩而難有大效，是以幾經硏討，決定建議採用簡捷有效的方法。即在根據本方案的法案，如經政府採用，那法案頒行的一天，佃耕土地，便無條件移歸佃農所有了。這樣便可省却許多討似還價的迂綏方法。而且預備補充；地主的僱農，亦一樣要無條件取得所耕的土地。</p>
<p>（二）爲表示法案成立的那一天，土地便確實是農民的了，那地稅便非由農民負担不可。因爲地稅是土地所有人對國家的義務，如地稅仍由原地主納付，那表示土地尙不是農民的，這個方案便失去它的價値，爲的是要使農民在精神上與在法理上得到保證，土地是他的了，那農民便非負担起這個納稅的責任不可，反之，爲使原地主知道他從法案成立那天起，便已將土地移轉給農民了，亦非立即解除他的納稅義務不可。無論地價怎樣還，什麽時候還淸，而土地總歸是農民的，那農民才會得到精神上的解放，才會從今起愛護土地，悉力耕作，農田的生產，才會從逐减的趨勢，轉變爲增加。</p>
<p>（三）農民是現實的，如說土地是七年以後給你，但你現在還是照樣去還租七年，農民是不感興趣的。因農民知道七年的漫長歲月中，政府是可能變卦的，地主亦可以利用機會用勢力壓倒他的。如地主照常納稅，農民照常交租，那便等於對現狀毫無變化，只是許了一個七年以後給予土地的空願。那便不能算有行動。</p>
<p>（四）旣然要農民負担稅，那農民便再無力照原租額還地價了。我們所以定地價爲佃租的七倍，是因爲根據一切調査，一般的地價，是七個「購買年」，但要農民一起拿出七年租價，固是不可能，即是仍叫他分七年拿出，且不令負稅，農民亦不會感到興趣。因爲對農民今日的生活仍沒有改善。我們固然要予農民以精神上的鼓勵。但更實際的，是要予農民以實際上的好處，來改善他們的生活。因此，所以即不令農民納稅，這七年租，亦要分十四年還的，許多先生誤會，以爲我們是生張十四年後，才給農民土地，這大槪是文字不够明顯的毛病。我們是主張立刻移轉土地給農民，所以在方案的第二章便說明了。至地價歸還的年期，爲農民打算，是愈長愈有利的。分年愈多，每年的負担額愈少。這是很明顯的，我們旣要表示土地自現在起便是農民的了，要他現在起便負担地稅。同時要農民在實際的計算上，分年價還地價，加上地稅，亦要比現在的租額爲輕，這才有實際的意義，所以我們規定分十四年交還地價。</p>
<p>（五）那麽替地主怎樣打算呢？老實說一切土地改革方案，沒有替地主打算的道理。但我們是小地主多的國家，地主的生路，亦不龍不稍爲做慮。因此我們不採用西歐各國分數十年還地　　方法，我們主張十四年，即每年地主仍收總地價等於地租的一半。但他却免去稅的負担。根據許多調査，現在一切徵實　借合計，重的地方，地主亦要交出租額的一半。輕的地方，亦在三分之一左右，但現在地主是不見得眞能收足佃租的，照我們的方法，我們保證地主收到等於租額一半的地價有十四年之久，而不要納稅，亦等於保證地生的生活十四年，如中國從此安定進步，而且工業化了，十四年後，地主自不患無謀生之路，即孤兒寡婦的小地主們，有十四年凈租之半的收入，他們的生活有保證，以後亦可有出路了。否則，地主如再一定要保障旣得利益，不肯走這條和平改革的路，我恐終有一日，要保障生命的安全亦不可能。現在共黨所引導的農民叛亂，不是擺在眼前的事實嗎？所以本會的辦法公佈後，很多開明的地主，均來函表示贊成，而且說他們現在佃租收不到，而田賦却負担很重，他們表示我們的辦法，是給他們解放的。</p>
<p>（六）爲政府打算：現在無論如何重的徵實，實收是沒有到全國農產物三十分之一的，這其間是稅收的毛病太多，制度和計算方法太困難，什麼按兩折元，按元折徵實物。這一套還是前淸田賦的繼續，只便利了中間胥役的中飽，我們正同吳景超先生一樣，盼望政府一舉廊淸稅制，在這過渡時期，痛快說照土地正產物收穫量征十分之一。什一之稅，是中國的古制，農民對此是有信仰的。各縣上，中，下田地統應定出一個止產物收穫量的等級，政府便照此征稅；而重新規定中央和地方劃分的標準，絕對禁止對土地再加任何攤派。中國的農民是最誠實和最服從的，他們決不逃合理合法之稅，過去，一因稅制混亂，二因地主以種種方法欠稅逃稅，所以政府的稅收，通常是「實征沒有達到「額征」的一半。如照我們的辦法，再加上集體繳稅的組織，那政府的稅收，一定要增加數倍，一切攤派均可取消，而不愁支出無可應。吳景超先生以農氏得土地而增據派爲慮，如政府　土地改革，而不肯辦這些經而易舉的稅政改革，那種政府，我們怎樣　其能實行土地改革呢？</p>
<p>（七）最後，吳先生以及其他好些報章上的議論，均以爲農民僅獲得這些小額田地是不足以解決問題的，這個議論我們聽之熟矣。但是今天的中國是要先解決今天的問題，再談明天的美滿計劃，如只想明天的美滿計劃，而不肯解決今天的生存問題，那眞是畫餅充飢於實際何補？我們第一步先使農民有了田地，我們再逐步使之合併田塲，增加收穫，乃至逐漸實行大農制度。要使過多的農民能够轉業到工商業上去，於是農民才平均能得到較多的土地。但此事，如非國家能安定，經濟能走上工業化的道路，是無法解決的。此時正是「救死不暇」的時候，怎樣可以那些空計劃來解決題呢？我們願以「卑之無甚高論」，解決現實問題的立意在此。希望各方賢達，能認識中國今日問題的嚴重，一致主張先由解決農民問題求得中國的安定。一切更進一步的建設計劃，且待中國逃出了死亡的威脅時再說。</p>
<p>至於吳先生的文字似乎說北方各省佃農數字並不多，這個方案並不眞正解決了問題。這點我願意補充來說：這個方案，本不是萬應靈膏。說可解決一切問題。但確是替中國問題中最主要部份，先求一個合理解決。北方各省佃農數字並不多，但這不多的佃農要求土地的問題，便釀成共產黨這樣大的叛亂的禍根。社會的叛亂，並不是眞要全體起來的。有百分之二十的人叛亂，便可要其餘百分之八十不能不跟着走。而且百分之二十左右的佃農，這個數字也够大了。共產黨甚聰明所以能把握住「土革」爲叛亂的主要根據。否則共產黨何以不拿其他問題呢？吳先生以爲如何？</p>

<p>〔本報北平七日航訊〕當聶榮臻第一六兩縱隊由察南轉鋒西去的月初，綏東綏南昇起了戰爭的風球，傳作義馬上飛歸綏佈署一切，四日國軍已在歸綏集寗集中就緒，傳氏乘機東返，途次集寗下機，停留了短短時間，召集新任卅五軍軍長郭景雲等指示機宜後，便又登機起飛。當飛機離開跑道昇起一房高的時候，傅將軍走進駕駛間的鐵門，命令駕駛員說：「飛北平去」，一句話剛剛說完，便突然仆倒在駕駛室的門口，原來飛機的一個引擎起火，駕駛員雖然從容關上油門，來一個幾乎是直角緊急轉灣下降，因爲機身已失去平衡，即由空中跌入田地，落地時只有一個輪着地，立刻翻倒，機身發生突然的震動，全機內的人都摔倒而且暈過去了，祗有一位半淸醒半暈迷的去摸索機門，也沒有能打開。</p>
<p>郭軍長追趕失事機</p>
<p>當昇空的飛機猛烈傾斜轉　下降時，在飛機塲送行的郭景雲軍長見來頭不佳，立刻乘吉普車向飛機的方向追去，趕到墜落的田野，他從外面才把機門打開，看見傳將軍頭跌到駕駛間裏邊，脚伸在客艙裏，還昏迷未醒，幸而當飛機最初傾移時，他因站立給駛員講話，便第一個倒下去。</p>
<p>未受劇震表皮擦傷</p>
<p>他沒有受到後來落地傾翻時的劇烈震動，所以祗背膀表皮上受點不重的擦傷，其他的隨員都受傷較重。郭軍長率領人員把機上的人們抬下飛機十來分鐘，昏迷的才慢慢淸醒過來，而那架飛機呢？在機上的人們剛被抬下飛機一分鐘後，汽油庫即行爆炸，機身全部燒掉，如果再遲一分鐘，一切援救都會沒有用處了。據說那架飛機在送傳離張飛綏時，引擎已經咯咯噠噠的作着不平常的響聲，到歸綏經過一番修理已經好了，那知竟終於在集寗失事了呢？</p>
<p>劉庸笙在歸綏治療</p>
<p>這次傳將軍最親信每出必帶的作戰處副處長劉庸笙和衛士隊長張某，受傷較重，現在歸綏治療中。傳將軍於五日乘北平新派的飛機飛還故都，軍政各界首長，紛紛都去西郊慰問。傳傷勢的確很輕，手臂已經能拿起報紙看報了。（本報特派員堅夫）</p>
<p>脫險經過堪稱奇蹟</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十日電〕傳作義將軍四日在集寗飛機失事脫險經過，實爲歷史上一大奇蹟。茲據目擊者談當時情形稱：四日傳作義偕隨員智仁傑，副官張靜濤等，乘專機於午間到達集寗，即召集高級將領開軍事會議，一一一時四十五分乘原機起飛上升時極快，未及二百公尺，飛機尾部即着火，其時傳氏正走入駕駛室吿駕駛員逕飛北平，原定飛張垣，飛機即於此時墜落於兩高邱間之凹地若偏左偏右，俱無法出險，飛機係側身墜地，故機翼被毁，機門朝天，智仁傑急拉門，竟未得開，張靜濤孔武有力，搶前拉開，臂受重傷，傳氏於飛機墜落時，因甫出駕駛室尙未落座，當被震倒，失去知覺，駕駛員及隨員等由機艙中挾持躍出，其時機艙已烟熖瀰漫，呼吸困難，傳氏及全機人員離開機體之一刹那，機身已轟然一響，完全焚毁，衆見傳氏滿身血跡，不省人事，立予救護，不久即甦醒，謂問何事？答以飛機已出險，檢視身上血跡，始知機中電務員撞落滿口牙齒，在機艙時伏於傅氏身上，斑斑血蹟，盡爲電務員口中所流出。</p>
<p>五日下午照常辦公</p>
<p>方傳氏起飛時，禁止高級將領送行，迨機塲警察發出報吿，各高級將領趨到機塲時，傳氏已乘機塲汽車歸來，途中遇有傷兵一人，尙飭令停車看護，當晚即在集寗駐軍司令部休息。次晨另乘一機飛返北平。五日下午北平有人得訊，往剿總探視傅氏已照常辦公矣。此次全機人員除張副官靜濤受傷已往醫院治療外，餘均無恙。傅氏僅額角擦傷皮膚，左臀略有靑腫，經醫師檢査內部，一切正常。</p>
<p>天次脫險令人驚奇</p>
<p>傳氏乘飛機出險，此已為第三次。第一次係西安事變後爲驚救蔣委員長由綏起飛迷途，夜間在河北易縣山地被迫降落，人機安全。第二次係前年秋由綏飛至凉城上空，發生故障，急返綏降落，離機後，機身即焚毁，現該機殘骸尙停於綏機塲。</p>

<p>〔路透社波哥大十日電〕哥倫比亞自由黨發動革命於奪得政府電台，企岡推翻貝萊士總統及其政府後，貝萊士之保守黨政府今日似已奪回首都之控權，貝萊士於十日標準時間上午一時二十分發表公報，在奪回之電台廣播，謂被狙之自由黨領袖蓋丹顯然係被親共產黨之人所害，渠並日：「城內雖尙有小接觸及暴動，然陸軍已能把握局勢，政府亦已採取揹施以恢復秩序」。汎美大會開會處之大厦亦一度爲暴徒衝入，會議爲之停頓。刧後之波哥大已若德機轟炸後的倫敦。先事尙在叛黨手中之電台，宣布自由黨任命之臨時總統埃斯坎達，已進入總統府企圖迫使貝萊士辭職，總工會之波哥大地方顧問共產黨員巴里雅，且令支持自由黨者，持武器或任何鐵器，赴街頭參加革命。哥倫比亞第三大城卡里之美國領事報告革命黨在陸軍及警察人員之支持下，已控制卡里城。另據革命黨方面廣播，接受政府電台時，曾與保守派起衝突，有自由派方面之人及學生四人殞命，在汎美大會開會處之國會大厦，保守派之警察曾向羣衆斷續開槍。</p>

<p>〔聯合社哥倫比亞京城九日電〕哥倫比亞今日發生革命，政府公署被佔領，並已設立新政府。京中武裝民衆起事時至少擊斃八人，其中並有現政府部長一人。革命之觸發係由於反對派自由黨領袖一九五〇年總統候選人蓋丹昨夜被狙殞命，此訊一經傳播，民衆大憤，即以各種武器衝至街頭，搗毀玻璃門窗，全市頓成一片混亂。</p>
<p>武裝羣衆旋蜂湧至總統府，高呼「打死戈梅慈！」戈梅慈係政府派保守黨領袖，現任泛美會議哥倫比亞代表團長。狙擊蓋丹之兇手亦被羣衆擊斃，曳至總統府前，碎尸洩憤。大部份軍警顯與革命羣衆一致，僅忠於現總統貝萊士者曾對企圖衝入總統府開槍。武裝羣衆旋佔領無綫電台，以自由黨革命委員會名義發出廣播，謂自由黨已接收政府，控制一父通。埃斯坎達博士已就任臨時總統，以待自由黨籍副總統桑提斯來京。蓋丹係在辦公處附近街頭區遭人槍擊，畀入醫院，施行手術挽救，一小時後，傷重不治，民衆約一千人聞訊，迅即蜂湧衝往國會大厦搗毀窗戶，破壞傢俱，縱火焚燒房屋數間，衛兵實力衆寡懸殊，似均不願干涉。國會大厦乃此次泛美會議會址所在，門前廣塲可聞槍聲，招待室亦被殃及，石塊亂飛，新聞記者費盡周折，始獲出外。民衆旋向總統府進發，嗣後軍隊開到，但因羣衆吶喊「哥倫比亞萬歲！人民萬歲！」以致頗盛猶豫，卒乃按兵不動。其時戈梅慈與礦務部長孟泰爾伏及另一保守黨領袖伐倫西亞已遇害。</p>

<p>〔路透社柏林九日電〕盟國觀察家相信西方强國業已決定减輕柏林之緊張局勢，此可由四方强國之決定不於四月十日召開四强盟管會會議，英總司令羅勃森爲撞機事答蘇總司令索柯洛夫斯基函內之緩和語氣，及羅勃森之同意由英蘇兩國而非四强共同調查撞機事證之·</p>
<p>就英國言，羅勃森在杜塞爾道夫之演辭，雖在促起組織新政治機構，使西德得以併入西歐，然同時英國對於柏林之危機，則採取較美國少具刺激性之態度。英國於蘇聯加緊管制陸上交通後，並未宣佈採取大規模之空運制度，而蘇軍派駐柏林英軍區內電台內之武裝衛兵，亦未被英方驅逐。英負責官方之意見，乃爲如果與蘇聯就德國政治問題演出破裂，亦不宜在危險的事件及驚人的謠諑氣氛中造成之。</p>

<p>（十五）中國東南部的危機</p>
<p>一九四四年，日本在中國自南至北開闢了一條大陸走廊，也就將滿洲與東南亞被征服地區——印度支那，暹羅，馬來亞和緬甸接連起來的一條交通綫。</p>
<p>現在，從歷史的遠景看，這一個努力不過是一個已受致命創傷的敵人在臨死前的一種掙扎，但在當時，幾乎淸算了中國國民政府的抵抗以及在中美戰時合作情形下美國三年來所作的投資。</p>
<p>對於這個攻勢，並未定出有效的計劃，用以對抗它的力量，僅有規模微小的第十四航空隊，羽毛未豐的中國空軍以及從沒有得到一噸美國援助的中國軍隊，後來蹤使有一點，也已失之過遲了。</p>
<p>一九四四年二月，當我第一次就敵人的威脅向史迪威將軍提出警吿之時，我要求在三月份中以燃料，藥彈與其他供應品八千噸供中美飛機之用，而我實際獲得的，不到此數之半。</p>
<p>四月中，適在攻勢發動之前，我提出抗議，認爲這種交貨辦法無法使物資存儲，勢將使我們對日本船隻，機塲和交通綫日益有效的攻擊，陷於停頓</p>
<p>當時，對日本船隻的攻擊，已超過試驗階段。敵人的商船約五萬六千九百噸以及砲艦兩艘已被擊沉，其中一萬六千七百噸大致是由第十四航空隊於一月間被擊沉的。我們具有每月至少擊沉日本船隻十五萬噸的希望。同時具有雷達設備的Ｂ—二四型機正準備掃蕩中國海，遠達菲律賓。</p>
<p>但是我在上面已經指出的貨物噸位上的限制，使支持中國軍隊防止日軍即將業動的攻勢所必需的物資，無法存備起來。我力言敵人的進攻將威脅整個自由中國的安全，包括在四川省成都附近當時即將完成的Ｂ—二九型基地在內。超空堡壘基地的空防，已完全交托予由我指揮的第十四航空隊。</p>
<p>史迪威的第一個反應，就是說聯。參謀部對於駝峯供應品並不給我優先享有權，因爲日軍在緬甸方面的遠征行動，依然威脅着印法爾以及在印度勃拉瑪普脫拉山谷的駝峯空運基地。事實是史迪威的緬甸作戰需要駝峯的供應品甚多。</p>
<p>史迪威對我說，中國境內的空軍活動祗有加以减少。</p>
<p>已往的記錄將顯示我對於日軍攻勢性質所作的預測，相當準確，後者係於四月間在河南省的黃河流域發動，而在下一個月復在揚子江南岸的湖南省發動。</p>
<p>由於我要求的三月份的八千噸被削减幾達一半，四月份的要求又被削减得幾乎一樣厲害，所以我建議首先把四月份的數量恢復，五月份至少要八千噸，而以復則每月增至八千噸</p>
<p>此外，我還提出一個變通辦法，主張把堆積在成都附近以備B—二九型應用的燃料暫時分派出來應用，並且假如未來的緊急局勢有些需要的話，那麼應以中國境內戰略攻擊代替Ｂ—二九型準備發動的對中國周圍地區的攻擊。</p>
<p>我坦白地對史迪威將軍講，除非按照上述辦法之一採取行動，那麼勢須通知蔣委員長一點，就是他不再能依賴我們的空軍對他的軍隊作有效支持，同時並通知華盛頓，說明整個中國的安全受到嚴重影響了。</p>
<p>史迪成的答覆還是說印度內部的危機，使改進駝峯空運增加對華供應無法實現，蔣委員長不應該期待第十四航空隊做不可能的事情。但是在這次交換意見之後，我却接到了我自從担任駐華美國高級空軍長官以來最奇怪的命令之一。</p>
<p>這個命令使保衛成都區成爲第十四航空隊的首要任務，甚至放棄對敵人船隻的攻擊以及對中國地上部隊的支持，亦所不惜，雖然中國的地上部隊當時正面臨着最大的考驗。</p>
<p>這個命令，是以中緬印戰區美國空軍印緬區指揮官史屈拉梅益將軍的一封信的形式送來的，但是信中說明史迪威亦持同樣意見。</p>
<p>這個指令的表面理由，就是我曾經對我方防禦Ｂ—二九型基地的能力表示懷疑，而我實際上所需提出的，乃是整個中國的安全問題。我從沒有提出單單關於成都基地一方面的防禦問題。</p>
<p>在那時候，昆明第十四航空隊司令部和駝峯路綫的中國主要終點正以一個戰鬥機大隊加以防衛，而有兩隊戰鬥機則正在保衛成都，所以成都的防衛要比昆明來得强些。</p>
<p>一向來，第十四航空隊的主要任務就是防衛中國方面駝峯路綫空遝終點以及在空中支持中國地上部隊。我被迫向史迪威指出這一點，希望他不要以相反的命令來東縛我的手脚。</p>
<p>我向他保證成都區的空中防禦，以與協助阻止當時在河南展開的日本攻勢以及準備支持不久即將渡過怒江前往緬甸的中國遠征軍相較，簡直是兒戯。</p>
<p>那一種軍事上的巧合是値得提出的，就是說當時中國最精銳的軍隊即怒江遠征軍，在史迪威的壓力之下正要在中國國境之外從事作戰，而日軍却已經開始在切斷中國的東南部了重！</p>
<p>當中國境內的危機爆發之時，史迪威和史屈拉梅益却在談成都區一地的空防問題，這個問題事實上並不存在·史迪威最後把這件事情不提了，意思中間却說我以前在無謂叫鬧。</p>
<p>他曾在緬甸某地過一些時候。他在那裏發出一個無綫電報，其中以諷刺的口吻說，他發覺成都的空防問題並不存在，「頗以爲慰」。這一點似乎使他很滿意，因爲他對中國的危機始終保留行動，直等到幾個月之後，那時中國東部的命運已經注定了。</p>

<h3 id="c51">共匪陰謀發動全面學潮　被捕暨大學生詳供內幕　黨政軍昨舉行聯席會議詳密研討 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲共匪擬在本市發動全面學潮事，本市黨政軍聯席會議，特於昨午在市府大禮堂鄭重舉行，會議由吳市長親自主持，除出席黨政軍首要人物外，並邀本市專科以上各學校校長列席，對學潮問題作周密研討。會議自下午三時半起，至七時許始散，內容秘不宣佈。</p>
<p>據市府新聞處昨發表稱：國立暨南大學學生衝突情形，各報巳有記載，茲據警察局發表事實眞相如次：本月八日下午該校學生張貼公吿，揭發此次少數同學赴杭遊春，目的在公祭于子三，發動學潮，響應蘇北共匪五日渡江陰謀。事爲遊杭同學所悉，將佈吿撕去，並在原處公吿，肆意辱駡，因此發生毆打。當有學生田幹吾被毆重傷。九日下午該校學生因同學田幹吾被遊杭同學毆傷，忿忿不平，再度發生互毆。學生王宗恕，殷振民亦被打傷，並查出同學王宗義係共匪幹部，崔維潔（女）有共匪重大嫌疑，當晚送往北站警察分局，訊問屬實，王宗義表示願意自首，並有自白書，（口供及自白畫附後），歷述參加共匪工作經過甚詳，供出崔維潔，係校中共黨領導人物之一，乃於昨日上午由北站警察分局將王崔二人解送警察總局法辦。</p>
<p>警察局對於本案，至爲重視，惟學生參加共匪工作，均屬意志薄弱，一時受愚，誤入歧途，深望彼等幡然悔悟，立即向該局自首，當局決本寬大爲懷，不咎旣往，予以安全保障。又外傳暨大同學互毆，有學生被毆受傷身死之說，茲經警察常局正式聲明，傳說絕對不確。　王宗義供出之共匪姓名，已由警察局將經過事實，通知學校當局及學生家長與保證人，並於昨（十日）晚九時派員赴校提訊。</p>
<h3 id="c52">王宗義自白書　先作準黨員受考察　每週復旦開小組會 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>茲將曁南大學學生王宗義之自白書及口供摘錄覓誌如下：（一）組織關係：我加入共黨，是由復旦葉錦文介紹加入，因我的身份是一地主的知識份子，據葉某說：「依黨鋼，地主知識份子只可先爲準黨員。」當時我寫就自傳一篇，及對時局看法文一籍，由葉某轉去，自此以後，即與葉某發生組織關係。因爲我是準黨員，須待兩年半考察，所以我的組織的橫關係，須受葉某指揮。除了每週在復旦開小駔討論會，與×××等發生橫的關係外，其餘則不許有橫的關係發生。至於上層直接指揮，即是葉某負責，我的下層工作即是「團結」「組織」暨大化學系同學。因我是一準黨員，無權介紹黨員，所以下層不曾發生黨的組織關係。</p>
<p>當敢死隊　負責宣傳工作</p>
<p>（二）工作計劃：工作計劃分爲組織工作與經常工作。組織工作就是每週召開小組會議，檢討當前時局及經常工作展開情形與困難。經常工作唯一目的，就是吸收黨員，一切發動「學潮」，爭取學會，都是爲了這一個目標。我因爲是一個準黨員，只負責宣傳工作，就是爲他們做敢死隊，向廣大同學們接觸暴露的工作，都是準黨員去做。關於宣傳方法，是分口頭與書籍兩種，書籍種類須視同學接受條件而決定，也就是用一種引誘方法去逐使同學迷惑。口頭宣傳方法，是先向同學們說明職業苦悶及經濟困迫，俟同學起同情心，再進而作政治性宣傳。這樣一次再一次宣傳，同學即會迷惑起來。</p>
<p>爭取公費為目標　京滬杭全面發動</p>
<p>在最近戰局發展指示，是定在五月前完成春季攻勢，即是擴大華北面的佔領，孤立北平·天津。在蘇北則基地健全鞏固，在東北則佔領長春後，入兵關內，而使華北兵源能夠作爲渡江之用。春季攻勢完成後，即在五月時開始大舉渡江。在渡江期間，各校共黨份子，以爭取公費爲主要目標，京滬杭全面發動學潮。當學潮鼓動後，工界共黨份子鼓動工潮，造成全面擾亂局面，假使渡江順利後，各校共黨逐使同學入江南遊擊區參加工作，使佔領基礎能夠很快「鞏固」。</p>
<h3 id="c53">口供摘録　借名集團遊杭　深夜秘密會議　浙江大學為總聯絡機構 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>春假是我們最好利用的時機，於是假借遊杭爲名，到杭州商討一切進行事宜的步驟，和所採取的手段。因爲杭州浙江大學是我們京·滬·杭·皖·贛等地的總聯絡指導機構，它完全聽命於香港支部。直接指揮這個聯絡指導機構，由浙大×××等人負責。到杭州後，把一些中立同學安頓好，我們就開始進行工作。四月二日夜二時許，我們集結了本校×××同志與外來的同志，開會商討工作計劃及如何展開宣傳，爭取中立同學。討論決議是：（一）發動外團組織，如基督教靑年團契及女同學會等。（二）籌組淸寒互助會，以發動全面公費運動，以造成全面性學潮。（三）發動「一校一事」運動，以達到五月暴動目的。（四）聯槍工人同志並煽動工潮等等。</p>
<p>這次旅行費，由上面津貼二千萬元，本校並由×××等數人，經常參加各校聯合會議，五日那天上午八時，公祭于子三烈士：由×××同志代表曁大自治會發表演說，其內容如下：「今天我們滬·杭兩地爲眞民主奮鬥的一千多位同學，聚集在于烈士墓上來弔祭，我們內心感到非常的悲哀，同時感到非常的悲憤。雖然環境惡劣，我們仍然非常努力艱苦的爲民主而鬥爭。我們從上海來的同學，回去以後，還要繼續擴大運動，以期發揮更大的力量。現在是時候了，我們應該加緊團結，以行動來達到眞民主運動的理想」。</p>

<p>經紀人交易存帳額達二萬餘億</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證劵交易所總經理王志莘氏，於昨下午三時，在該所招待本市新聞界。王氏即席致詞，對該所遵令停辦遞交之感想，叙述甚詳。渠稱：本所遞交業務，近奉令遵時停辦，四月三日本所遞交存帳額，爲一○五五億元。經紀人交入之證據金，爲五二三億元。按規定應將證據金百分之七十，繳存國家行局，而本所則以全部繳存。當時所慮者，爲經紀人方面交易存帳總金額，估計達二萬餘億元，措施稍一不愼，必致引起金潮。茲最後一期，已於昨日（九日）順利交割結東，實可慶幸。</p>
<p>本所一切措施，悉秉政府法令辦理。遞交自數次試辦，至正式辦理，均經政府核准。此次亦係急促奉令停辦。茲願略叙本所對停辦遞交之感想：</p>
<p>（一）此次政府停辦遞交命令有言，本所辦遞交後，買賣證券者，常爲同一人，足以助長投機。此說疑指套利交易而言，實乏根據。蓋信任法幣者，始肯購入現貨，售出遞交，以博些微利息。亦僅有有心長期投資者，始願售出現貨，購入遞交，俾證券不致脫手。故唯有要求安全保障之穩健者，及願將資金投入生產事業者，始願套買套賣。</p>
<p>（二）套利有集中游資之作用，該項游資，大多來自零星散戶，不作套利，即競購日用品，或作黑市拆放，工商業有利用套利，以融通資金，惟不信套利資金，均用諸囤積，更不信遞交引導物價上漲。</p>
<p>（三）利率高低，決全於資金之供求，套利利率亦然，而統計套利利率，常低於市塲暗息。</p>
<p>（四）目前投機囤積之現象，其綫結決非緣於證券市塲之存在，更非遞交開做之故，而遞交停辦後，散戶游資，可能散向投機囤積之途。而證券市塲，因無七日內套買賣之調節，證券似格之感應性，可能更見敏銳云。</p>

<p>原因爲國外油價續跌</p>
<p>中信局收購之桐油，日來較爲淸淡。據悉：產區價漲，油商多不願脫手，執貨待價而沽。梧州，廣州兩地，亦有同樣現象。截至目前爲止，僅收一千零五十噸。又國外市塲業已轉弱，每磅跌至美金二角三分左右。</p>
<p>據中信局負責人談：政府爲穩定國內外之價格，收購之桐油，決暫不外銷，以免國際市塲再趨下跌，待國際市塲有需要，價格轉好時，再行售出。國內方面，繼續收購，使出口商能維持其成本，政府收購政策之實施，此時已發揮顯著之效用。</p>

<h3 id="c119">論打字機 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>我曾經學過華文打字，學了三四天總算學會了，但學會了十五六年之後並未用過。一則無意於做打字員，再則又不大量寫信，大量寫稿，無須買一架打字機，而且也買不起。</p>
<p>但即使買得起了，我也決不去買。老實說我反對字去打而不去寫。然而世上竟有熟心打字之人，至於認爲目前的華文打字機不夠精良，還要悉心研究力碟改善。</p>
<p>夫字之改寫爲打，目的常在於快。以目前通行的華文打字機而論，雖然改進有人，比寫已經快了好幾倍，倘再改良成　，自更臻於「神速」。届時一個本來用管幾十個抄寫人員的大機關，大槪只須用個一位打字員了。</p>
<p>凡發明或改進工具機器者，目的之一即在於節省人力節省時間。是誠佳事。以打字機論，假如我在家裏每日須寫稿五千字，那麼即使不必恭楷寫來，挖空心思，亦至少須費五小時，寫得手也酸了，背也痛了，胃口不開，大便秘結。如用打字機，則即使用未經改良的打字機，至多也不過三小時。又假如我開的是寫字店或以公文信件爲主要業務的機關，在打字機未發明未改良以前，假定要用夥計十名，現在有了神速打字機，假定至多用了三人，薪水支出大减而收入如常，豈不大妙。所以即使要我向發明或改良打字機的先生肅電致敬，我又怎麼會不願。</p>
<p>然而假如我是給人家抄錄公文信件之類爲生的，那麼對於一打字機的發明者或改良者，即不恨之刺骨，亦必並不歡迎，蓋即使不在被裁之列，我的工作也決不因有打字機而减少，因爲被裁者以前所做的工作，要由我擔任了。倘不幸而在被裁之列，自更有失業之痛，恨不得把打字機發明者或改良者咬他三口五口。</p>
<p>當然，自打字機發明，一方面固然打碎了若千抄寫員的飯碗，一方面以製造打字機出售打字機需人，也給人開了一扇我職業之門，未嘗不是失之東隅，收之桑榆。但姑不論一失一得是否相等，即使相等，我也覺得何必多此一舉，平空添了許多麻煩。</p>
<p>因思發明之事，可爲而不可爲。有許多東西是値得發明的，例如我常苦查字典之煩，馨香祝　有人發明一種自動字典，譬如說我要查某一個字，不必翻來翻去，祇要在書上一撳，那字就應聲而出。這種發明只能增加得業人數而不至增加失業人數，因查字典的人決不用好一個專員的。</p>
<p>反之凡是有關已成「行業」者，暫以不發明節省人力的工具機器爲是。講物質文明，提倡科學的人想必以上說爲謬論，但是橫覽九洲，我自信愚見頗有一得。鄙意是科學進步機器發明以節省人力，本是好事，但須如此節省法：例如某機關的抄錄員本來日抄公文十件，費時八小時，現在因有打字機的發明與改良，日打公文十件只須二小時，省下六小時來就可以之看看書，談談天，下下　，睡腫覺，身閉體胖，精神健旺。不然的話，我寗願科學退步，機器不發明。不幸的是世界現狀，正在「不然的話」中，豈不悲哉！</p>
<h3 id="c120">杞人憂天 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>德國海德爾堡的星象學家華爾夫，在一九〇九年九月十一日發表，他發現一顆彗星，按預計時間，將在一九一〇年的五月十八日從天空中疾掃下來。這個消息倒並不引起驚奇，因爲據二千年史籍相傳，這顆特殊的哈萊氏彗星（Holley＇s　Comet)每七十六年一週期，總要掃過地球一次。</p>
<p>遠在十八世紀的星象家，就推算到一九一〇年彗星將在地球上空出現，因此對於華爾夫的云云，並無驚奇反響。但某幾個自作聰明的科學家確實講過關於彗星的種種陳舊迷信之談。例如一〇六六年彗星掃過地球時，正是諾爾曼人（Norman）侵略不列顚的時候。還有其他幾次哈萊氏彗星出現的時候，洪水爲患，兵戈擾攘，疫厲叢生，饑饉遍野……總要發生一點不幸的事。</p>
<p>自華爾夫發現了這彗星方位後，其他星象學家也一致認爲花一九一〇年之五月十八日，彗星行經地球，非常密近，將被它的尾部所掃到。而據說彗星之尾部含有　一種可燃性的毒氣名氰氣，將爲患地球上的生物。於是大家都感到恐懼起來。各地星象學家都預言彗星之降臨，將引起莫大禍患，說得嚴重一點，便是可以造成世界之末日。</p>
<p>早在一九一〇年的四月初旬，人們已經可憑肉眼望見彗星。大衆都感到異常恐懼。彗星向中國西北部如漢口，北平疾趨時，農民們認爲是反抗皇室的象徵（似指辛亥革命—譯者）城市的街道上引起流血慘劇。</p>
<p>同時，彗星的出現，反映到個人心理之反常。有一乘輸船赴吉美加去的旅客看見彗星正由古巴疾趨而來，竟致翻身落海。匈牙利有一豪富地主爲彗星之出現自刎而亡，遺書說是恐防彗星將致彼於死地，不如自殺來得爽快。阿拉勃瑪一農夫服毒自盡，以僻避慧星凶燄。</p>
<p>美國鋼鐵公司董事長柯萊勸吿朋友快快收轉「頭寸」，因爲彗星出現，將引起經濟崩潰。到五月十八那天，形勢更其嚴重，大家都向天文台詢問怎樣對抗氰氣的毒燄。在芝加哥與柏林，家中婦女用破布塞好門窗隙縫；瑪哈坦地方一個一者名廠商，建起一幢裝甲小室，內諸氧氣一百桶，以濟空氣之不足。有的人則走向宗敎一途。墨西哥土人在高山頂上建起十字架，日夜祈禱。蘇聯則有通宵的敎堂禮拜。波托里科的土人燃燭游行，馴致晨林荒蕪。美國也有不少人廢時失業，坐待混沌。科羅拉多銀礦裏的礦工躲在礦底不出來，等待彗星行過。南部的棉田和烟草田工作都停頓下來，因爲黑人要祈禱求得上帝的救護。</p>
<p>於是，偉大的一九一〇年五月十八日來了。白天一點沒有動靜，據說最恐怖的是在夜間。有的人要慶祝其在地球上的最後一夜，特舉行「彗星鷄尾酒會」，有的在屋頂花園或公園裏舉行「彗星舞會」，但一夜過去，並無異象。僅是法國一家天交台上看到天空中有一點燐光，航綫上的羅盤微受電波阻撓的影響。僅此而已。沒有毒氣，沒有混沌，更無世界之末日云。</p>

<p>昔人有名與字相同者，史籍所見甚多，唐人尤衆；例如郭子儀父子，皆名字相同，近代出土之王仲堪基誌（石存今北平崇效寺），亦有「君名仲堪，字仲堪」之句。又有以三字爲字者，如前凉張天錫，字公純嘏。隋時道士屈突無爲，字無不爲。宋時晁以道，字說之，一字伯以父。而歐陽文忠公所作劉原父墓誌志劉氏兄弟云：「敞字伯貢父，攽字仲原父。」至明末遺老傳山，字靑主，一字公之陀。聞惢泉，字天迺學。陶一，字昭萬有，梁流，字淵之審。撰畫徵錄之張庚，字公之于。而唐時婦女，多用三字爲字，楊君夫人韋氏碑：「夫人諱檀特，字昆邪黎。」盧公夫人崔氏墓誌：「夫人名積，號尊德性。」優婆夷未曾有塔銘：「優婆夷諱未曾有。」比邱尼法願墓誌：「法願字無所得。」范氏夫人墓誌：「姓范，諱如蓮花。」此外尙多，不能盡紀，惟唐後則不槪見矣。</p>
<p>姓與名同者，頗不多見，辛稼軒二妾，一曰田田，一曰錢錢。明時有著酒槪四卷之沈沈。淸山陰有幕客曰孫孫。近代黨國要人有葉葉（即葉楚傖先生）。而三字相同者，聞淸李光緒時，湖南有麋生名樂樂樂，蓋取仁者樂山，智者樂水之義，三字三讀，昔曰岳效洛，匪夷所思，亦足爲名字史上，別開一新奇生面也。</p>
<p>况姓名連綴，亦廣異聞，如古人田延年·錢延年·王祥娘·張王綱·陳洵仁·田娟娟·陸復福，則姓與名同在一韻。如羅衣輕·苗勃然·李無言·錢萬選·鳴九旱·王佐才·萬象春。時雨化。程九萬·富好禮·米萬鐘，則姓名聯貫有義。用數目者，有六十七，七十一，七十五，八十六，九十。用干支者，有申亥，丁丙，寅午辰，丁申。似婦女者，有馮婦，翠鴛鴦，徐夫人，丁夫人。同韻目者，有宋有元·阮咸。覃元先。齊泰·阮元·馬錫泰·蕭敬。而吳大有，字有大，冒起宗，字宗起，則倒名爲字，更饒興味。至淸龔公襄（孝琪）之曰太息，曰毋毋，曰橙，日小定，日江上一爺，曰刷刺，曰昌匏，曰飲酒食肉眠花僧……等幾達數十，實不　石濤和尙專美於前。（編者按：余在中學讀書時，曾遇一姓「六」之同學，據云其姓必須寫小寫之「大」，不可寫大寫之「陸」云。）</p>

<p>最近上海在抽壯丁，並且已抽籖完畢，黃浦區已發表了中籖者的名單。服兵役本是國民應盡的義務。但我國軍隊生活實在也太淸苦了些。試看美國的徵兵情形，就可明白雙方的差別了。下面是美國報上的徵兵廣吿。</p>

<p>（二）不可再等候了，延遲將使你失去機會，「遠征軍的權利法案」還沒有過期，對參加美國海軍陸戰隊的人們是有効的。欲加入者從速，請至陸戰隊招募站接洽。</p>
<p>（三）投身正規軍，才是優美生活的開始，光明的前程在等候你。所以，明天你所應該做的第一件事，就是訪問臨你最近的陸軍招募站。</p>

<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>據說眞正的美是天生的，用不到裝飾打扮，然而事實上裝飾打扮的人，事，物，依然很多，就因爲這些人，事，物原先並不十分美的綠故，所以便不得不借　人工。</p>
<p>其實外表整潔態度彬彬等本無可厚非，但是不可過於做作，甚至因只顧裝璜門面而忘了改進內部貨物，便格外要不得。辦事要講効率，但並不能爲了要加强効率而專事表面而不切實際的工作，因爲外强中乾，並不能夠對事實有所補益。恰恰相反，祗有成爲增進効率的障礙。</p>
<p>就拿各項國營事業中被譽爲辦得最有成績的郵政事業來說，最近似乎頗多新的建樹和改進，例如趕班郵筒行動郵局郵亭分區投遞之類，其中有幾項的確是能夠使大衆受着實惠，但是有幾項却並無多大功用，就像行動郵局，事實上眞的寄信算準了時間去候車的人極少極少；郵亭亦然，我每次走過八仙橋的郵亭，就想起金陵中　　　　　　　，在此另建郵亭似乎多此一舉。最近聽說又有什麼玻璃郵筒出現，我想也沒有多大意義，還不如把這筆錢省下來讓辛勤的郵務佐們增加一些待遇，或者多設鄕村的代辦所來得切實有益。</p>
<p>這裏所以以郵局舉例者，因爲目前的郵局在採納大衆意思，這一點上比一般機關做得好，而本質上郵局需要改進的地方也還多得很。最近郵資增價了，增價是可以原諒的，但如果把增加的錢化在表面工作的粉飾上，我說決不能夠原諒。</p>
<p>然而郵局之例是小也者，整個中國，無論政府機關，私人公司，一切行政大都只重表面，當局所要求於行政人員的也只圖表面的整潔有効率便成。曾記得某外國記者稱中國的政治家們大都是泥水匠出身，因爲他們所做的工作，只是一層層的把白粉往牆上刷，只要看上去雪白有光，至於牆的基礎如何，照例一槪不聞不問，這話雖近於謔，但是者之事實，我們自己要不要默然自慚呢？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Gu Weijun and Others Visit Lovett to Discuss the Implementation of Aid to China Plan, Truman Also Meets with Kong Xiangxi <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, New York, 9th Dispatch] Kong Xiangxi paid a visit to President Truman at 3:30 pm, and was received by the American President at the White House. The nature of Kong's visit this time could not be determined. According to Kong's later statement to reporters, the visit was purely a private matter. However, Kong's visit was officially recorded in the White House's record and the conversation time exceeded a normal visit, so most people believed that it must have involved important issues regarding China. White House reporters welcomed Kong and speculated a lot about his visit to the American President. However, some believed that since Kong was a leading Chinese politician, meeting with the President was within expectations. In addition, according to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 9th, Kong Xiangxi told reporters that he thanked the American President for the aid to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th, United Press Dispatch] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, recently visited the Acting Secretary of State, Lovett, to discuss "Implementing the Aid to China Plan." Ambassador Gu told reporters afterwards that China very much hopes that the Aid to China Plan will be implemented as soon as possible, and he has informed Lovett of this intention. Gu continued by saying that China has not yet issued a letter expressing its willingness to comply with the conditions stipulated in the American aid plan because the U.S. State Department has not yet notified China regarding the form of the letter to be used. However, the American notification will be issued soon, and China will submit the letter in a timely manner. Bei Zuyi, the head of the Chinese Technical Representative Group in the United States, also accompanied Ambassador Gu to visit Lovett this time. According to Bei, he and his team members have been in the U.S. for the past few months consulting with the U.S. side on the details of the Chinese reconstruction plan. Bei said that he will return to China "soon". In addition, former Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi visited President Truman, and the meeting lasted 20 minutes. Kong stated that the visit was "purely private."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th Dispatch] Lovett stated that the visit by Ambassador Gu and others was to discuss "the implementation of the Aid to China Plan."</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 9th Dispatch] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Gu Weijun, stated today that the Chinese government will submit a "letter of intent" before the Aid to China Plan begins to be implemented. He stated that military aid of $125 million and economic aid of $338 million will take effect as soon as possible. He also stated that it is expected that materials will not be delivered immediately until the details are agreed upon.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Discussion of the Draft Agenda, Chaos at the Meeting Almost Led to Violence <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The National Assembly's fifth session discussed the draft agenda, and the scene was unprecedentedly chaotic. The meeting began at 9:20 am, with 2,090 representatives present. The seventh group of the presidium took turns to preside, chaired by Xue Dubi. First, the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, and then Bai Chongxi reported on the instructions of the presidium to communicate with General Fu Zuoyi, and it was decided that the General Assembly would send a telegram of condolence. At 9:45 am, Chairman Xue announced the discussion of the draft agenda. Representatives from the Henan region, such as Zhou Yanguang, successively put forward their opinions, believing that before each meeting reviewed national affairs, the heads of each ministry and commission should attend, present reports, listen to reviews, and answer questions. Before long, when Zhou Yanguang's oral explanation of his opinions touched on Chairman Jiang's report on the 9th, citing limited data and time, there were still some details that were not fully covered, which caused public outrage from some of the audience, who used jeering to stop Zhou from speaking, almost leading to violence. Some representatives protested against this, and the meeting became extremely chaotic. Fortunately, Chairman Xue cited Article 59 of the rules of procedure, reminding the attending representatives of their responsibility to jointly maintain order in the meeting. After most representatives responded with applause, the meeting returned to stability, and the disturbance was calmed down. Zhou reiterated his proposal to listen to reports by category and conduct national affairs reviews, and stated that his opinion on Chairman Jiang's report stemmed from his love for Chairman Jiang and he did not expect to be misunderstood by his colleagues. Subsequently, Zhu Huanbiao, a representative from the Soviet Area, proposed that the deadline for joint nomination of the president and vice president and the election date should be discussed and decided by the General Assembly according to law, and then be included in the agenda. Li Yuan, a representative from the Zhejiang Area, proposed that the meeting schedule should be extended to allow sufficient time to handle proposals. Most representatives cited Article 53 of the rules of procedure, which stipulates that the agenda should be determined by the General Assembly before the election, advocating that the election should be moved back to be conducted after the proposals were discussed. Some representatives also advocated adding an agenda item that candidates should attend the General Assembly before the election to deliver campaign speeches. The Xinjiang representative, Wu Tiekuer, also made his first speech since the opening of the meeting, advocating that the constitutional amendment agenda should have a longer time. The head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission also attended the General Assembly to report on the administration of border affairs. At 10:45 am, there was a recess, and at 11:10 am, the meeting continued. After Deputy Secretary-General Liu Dongyan read more than a dozen written opinions, Liu Huan (Mrs. Zhu Shaozhou), a representative of women's groups, stated that she was prepared to be hissed after speaking. She refuted the public opinion, pointing out that the audience had made resolutions beyond the scope of the constitution in a confused state, and the National Assembly was not a Political Participation Council and should not have routine administrative reports. Some of the audience immediately roared and hissed, trying to stop her from speaking by jeering. This move immediately aroused the anger of female representatives and some male representatives. With fair support, she was allowed by Chairman Xue to return to the podium to state her full opinions. The meeting adjourned in chaos at 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Bai Chongxi Calls on Everyone to Maintain Order <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:40 pm. Chairman Bai Chongxi reported on the Presidium's submission of a written opinion from female representative Zhang Sheng et al. requesting to guarantee female representatives' freedom of speech at the meeting. He then pointed out in his capacity as a representative: freedom of speech is the foundation of democratic politics, and he hoped that all colleagues would deeply understand this and abide by the rules of procedure, maintain order, and respect the right of every representative to speak, setting an example for the constitutional government of the country. Then, Deputy Secretary-General Liu Dongyan read the written opinions of the representatives on the draft agenda, which were generally the same as those put forward in the morning. After the reading, Gu Zhenggang, a representative from Guizhou, spoke, stating briefly: the opinions of the representatives in the morning meeting focused on two points, one was that before reviewing national affairs, they must listen to the administrative reports of government officials, and the other was the agenda for the election of the president and vice president should be arranged after the discussion and decision of the constitutional amendment. However, he believed that the review of national affairs should focus on the word "review" and should not be like the past Political Participation Council, suffering from the fatigue bombing of government officials. Although the National Assembly is the highest body of power for the people to exercise political power, in fact, part of the political power has been exercised by the Legislative Yuan. According to the constitution, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and whether the administrative heads must accept the decision of the National Assembly is worth considering. He said: abiding by the law is democracy, and suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution are the most important national affairs. As for the order of the election and constitutional amendment agenda, he suggested that they should be carried out in coordination, and the conference should be closed by the 25th at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e5">"Delay Wastes" is Against the Goal of Suppressing the Rebellion <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>He believed that a one-day delay in the meeting would not only cause significant loss of national wealth, but also give the communist bandits an opportunity to make trouble. Now student unrest has risen again in Ping and Rong, and the resignation of the main responsible persons of local departments to attend the meeting is quite related. This is enough to prove that unnecessary delays and wastes are contrary to the goal of suppressing the rebellion. He suggested that the Presidium hold a meeting to integrate the opinions of the representatives, revise the agenda, and submit it to the General Assembly for decision after the break. This suggestion was agreed by the audience with applause, and Chairman Bai announced a break at 4:15 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Related Procedural Issues Have Been Resolved <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The meeting continued at 4:40 pm. After Secretary-General Hong Guanyou read the revised draft, he reported the Presidium's summary of the five revised opinions: (1) The review of national affairs should be divided into three parts: military, economic, and political, after listening to the reports of government officials, and should be carried out for three days. The government will answer the various reviews on the fourth day. (2) The discussion agenda of the constitutional amendment should be moved before the election of the President and Vice President. (3) The nomination and announcement procedures for the President and Vice President candidates should be coordinated with the general agenda and carried out as early as possible in accordance with the law. (4) The deadline for proposals will be one week from today, until 12:00 noon on the 17th, but the constitutional amendment will be discussed in advance, so the deadline is also advanced to 12:00 noon on the 14th. (5) The meeting period will be extended by two days to the 24th. After the report, Hong explained Zhu Bingbiao's questioning about the nomination of the President and Vice President candidates, taking the date of the announcement as the deadline. Chairman Bai then put the revised draft to a vote. The voting machine was unprecedentedly bright, with 1,837 representatives present, and 1,817 in favor. The proposal was finally passed with the support of more than 98.9% of the attending representatives, so that the procedural issues related to the meeting were finally resolved 12 days after the opening. Finally, Liu Dongyan reported that the motion proposed by the Henan representatives, requesting that the government military authorities quickly send a large army to reinforce the Central Plains and ensure Zheng and Bian, had been ordered by the Presidium to be handled quickly by the Secretariat. The meeting was adjourned at 5:10 pm.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The Xinjiang representative made his first speech at the National Assembly on the morning of the 10th. Wu Tiekuer, a representative from Hesh County and the current editor-in-chief of the Uyghur newspaper, delivered his speech in Uyghur, and Tu Leqian, a representative from Zhenyou County, served as the translator, raising two points. One was that the constitution is the foundation of democratic politics, and it is not easy for border compatriots to gather in Beijing, so there should be sufficient time for the discussion of constitutional amendment proposals. The other was that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission should report to the General Assembly on the administration of border affairs. Although the central government also cares about Xinjiang, it still lacks preferential treatment to comfort the Xinjiang compatriots' loyalty to the country. He also emphasized: "Xinjiang is an important gateway to the northwest for the country. Without Xinjiang, there is no northwest, and without the northwest, there is no country." He ended his speech in warm applause.</p>

<h3 id="e14">National Assembly Diary: The Unfolding of the "Anti-Hissing Gate Struggle" <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Female Representative Says: "We Are Representing the Wives of All of You Gentlemen to Speak, Please Do Not Give Disrespectful Hissing!"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] The situation at the meeting was like the weather, once sunny and then cloudy. Chairman Jiang said "Absolutely cannot make a fool of ourselves for the communist bandits", the words were still in our ears, but the General Assembly on the 10th caused another storm due to the agenda issue, and it has entered the lens of foreign reporters.</p>
<p>The chairman of the General Assembly this morning was the kind old man Xue Dubi, who felt quite tricky about controlling the chaotic meeting. The applause for consoling Fu Zuoyi had just ended, and the hissing condemning Representative Zhou Yanguang had begun. The fact that there were no policy reports on the agenda and that the election was placed before amending the constitution made the representatives unbearable. The speaker's request was roughly to continue with other policy reports first, then review and amend the constitution, and then hold the election. Although the constitution does not give the General Assembly the power of "reporting" and "review", the opinion of the public is to do so, and those who know what's going on are silent. Zhou Yanguang originally held the same view, only to blame him for poor speaking skills, which led to the problems. His original intention may have been "The report of Chairman Jiang is still not detailed enough," but what he said was "I am not satisfied with the report of Chairman Jiang." This sentence ignited the powder keg, and hissing broke out in the meeting place. Someone shouted "Don't let him speak," and someone shouted "Fight the communists," and the crowd surrounded the aisle. Zhou Yanguang in front of the microphone was frightened, Xue Dubi and Hong Lanyou strongly urged everyone to sit down, but the meeting was still a mess. It was easy to calm down, allowing Zhou Yanguang to have the opportunity to finish his revised opinion and explain the misunderstanding caused by the sentence just now, but before and after the break, the opinions of the speakers were almost the same, still requiring "reporting," "reviewing," and "amending the constitution" first, and finally holding the election. Representative Liu Huan, the wife of Zhu Shaozhou, did not reduce her courage because she was a woman. It was already 11:30, and her delicate voice came from the microphone: "I know my opinion will be hissed by everyone, but I hope you will wait until I finish speaking before hissing." She expressed her opposition, pointing out that "reporting" and "reviewing" exceeded the scope of the constitution, but her voice could not correct the wrongness, but instead caused rejection. When she only said a small part, hissing and shouting covered the entire meeting place. She was forced to step down, and then encouraged by the female representatives, she went back on the podium, and then stepped down again, several times like this. She finally spoke again, but the shouting upstairs and downstairs had drowned out her voice. Xue Dubi and Hong Lanyou's restraint was ineffective, and they let the chaos go on for ten minutes. News reporters scurried around, and Liu Huan became a good target for the camera. Although someone shouted "Say less," Liu Huan finally finished speaking what no one could hear before stepping down. Female representative Zhang Shengyi stood up and appealed in the posture of the weak, saying that the number of people represented by female representatives is larger, and their responsibilities are greater than those of male representatives. She hoped that they would not be given disrespectful hissing. Her conclusion was: "The speeches of female representatives are representing the speeches of your dearest wives." This caused laughter and applause in the whole audience, and the atmosphere was a little relaxed, but it was already the legal adjournment time. People seemed to calm down a little after getting vented. The situation was better when the meeting opened in the afternoon. Chairman Bai Chongxi attended the meeting in military uniform. Gu Zhenggang's speech was straightforward and comfortable. He hoped that the General Assembly could create a democratic and law-abiding style and advocated amending the constitution and holding elections at the same time. This was the only opinion in today's meeting that could make everyone unanimously support it. Only a representative upstairs objected, saying, "We must amend the constitution before the election, otherwise, after the election, the representatives will leave and there will not be enough legal number of people, and the constitution will not be able to be amended." However, this opinion could not stand the crowd's mood of seeking peace after a long period of chaos. Bai Chongxi announced that the Presidium would summarize everyone's opinions and submit a revised proposal, which was unanimously approved by everyone.</p>
<p>After the break, the new agenda was successfully passed. This was the achievement of the day. A storm brought about an agenda. Looking back at the General Assembly, it has been open for two full weeks. (April 10th in Nanjing)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Today's meeting can be said to be a kind of "anti-hissing struggle." "Democracy is a political system that allows opponents to speak fully." This call was only heard today, giving those who know it the feeling of "a voice in an empty valley."</p>
<p>This morning, the registration office for the representatives was particularly crowded. It turned out that the "Vice Chairman Sun's Election Committee for Vice President" was distributing free movie tickets for tomorrow morning, "Six Palaces of Powder and Rouge" at the Dahua Theater and "Red Sleeves Tilt the City" at the Xindu Theater.</p>
<p>This afternoon's meeting was the latest to start and the earliest to end, starting at 3:40 pm and adjourning at 5:10 pm, including a 15-minute break.</p>
<p>Some people predict that the vice-presidential election will have to go through three rounds of voting, eliminating and eliminating before a decision can be made, because based on the current situation, no vice-presidential candidate can get more than half of the votes in the first round.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Sunday Forum Explaining the Land Reform Plan and Answering Mr. Wu Jingchao, et al. <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zheng</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Land Reform Association announced the land reform plan, newspapers and magazines at home and abroad have praised it and offered advice, for which we are deeply grateful. In particular, Mr. Wu Jingchao's article "Critique of the Land Reform Plan" in the Nanjing Central Daily News raised relatively clear questions. Letters from friends also frequently inquired about the doubts raised by Mr. Wu. I hereby respectfully provide the following answers to the main points of the original plan:</p>
<p>(1) The main purpose of this plan is to solve the most serious problem of tenant farmers demanding land in China in the most clear and concise way. The tenant farming system is the most common and most harmful system in China. It not only impoverishes the majority of farmers, but also gradually reduces the yield of the land. In view of the fact that the previous plan of "taxing away landlords" was not a quick fix, and the method of "buying away landlords" by issuing bonds was too slow and difficult to achieve significant results, the Association, after several discussions, decided to recommend a simple and effective method. That is, according to the bill based on this plan, if adopted by the government, on the day the bill is promulgated, the tenant-farmed land will be unconditionally transferred to the tenant farmers. This will save many roundabout methods of bargaining. Moreover, it is prepared to supplement that the landlords' hired farmhands should also unconditionally obtain the land they cultivate.</p>
<p>(2) In order to show that the land truly belongs to the farmers on the day the bill is enacted, the land tax must be borne by the farmers. Because the land tax is the obligation of the landowner to the state, if the land tax is still paid by the original landlord, it indicates that the land still does not belong to the farmers, and this plan loses its value. In order to ensure that the farmers are guaranteed in spirit and in law that the land is theirs, the farmers must bear the responsibility of paying this tax. Conversely, in order to let the original landlord know that from the day the bill is enacted, he has transferred the land to the farmers, he must immediately be relieved of his tax obligations. No matter how the land price is repaid, or when it is fully repaid, the land will always belong to the farmers. Only then will the farmers be spiritually liberated, cherish the land from now on, and work diligently. Only then will the production of farmland change from a gradually decreasing trend to an increasing one.</p>
<p>(3) Farmers are realistic. If you say that the land will be given to you after seven years, but you still have to pay rent for seven years, the farmers are not interested. Because farmers know that in the long seven years, the government may change its mind, and the landlord can also take the opportunity to overwhelm him with power. If the landlord pays taxes as usual and the farmers pay rent as usual, it is equivalent to no change in the status quo, but only a empty promise of giving land after seven years. That cannot be considered an action.</p>
<p>(4) Since the farmers have to bear the tax, they will no longer be able to repay the land price at the original rent rate. The reason why we set the land price at seven times the rent is because, according to all investigations, the general land price is seven "purchase years." However, it is impossible for farmers to pay seven years' rent all at once, even if they are still asked to pay it in seven years and not be taxed. Farmers will not be interested either. Because there is still no improvement in the farmers' lives today. We certainly want to give farmers spiritual encouragement. But more practically, it is to give farmers practical benefits to improve their lives. Therefore, even if the farmers are not taxed, these seven years' rent must be repaid in fourteen years. Many gentlemen misunderstood that we were only giving the farmers land after fourteen years. This is probably a problem of unclear wording. We advocate immediately transferring the land to the farmers, so it is explained in the second chapter of the plan. As for the repayment period of the land price, it is more beneficial to the farmers the longer it is. The more years it is divided into, the smaller the annual burden is. This is very obvious. We want to show that the land belongs to the farmers from now on, and we want them to bear the land tax from now on. At the same time, we want the farmers to practically calculate that the annual land price repayment, plus the land tax, is also lighter than the current rent. Only then will it have practical significance. Therefore, we stipulate that the land price will be repaid in fourteen years.</p>
<p>(5) So how do we plan for the landlords? To be honest, all land reform plans have no reason to plan for the landlords. But we are a country with many small landlords, and the landlords' livelihood must be considered a little. Therefore, we do not adopt the method of repaying the land in scores of years used by Western European countries. We advocate fourteen years, that is, each year the landlord still receives half of the total land price equal to the rent. But he is exempted from the tax burden. According to many investigations, now all actual levies and borrowings combined, in heavy areas, the landlord also has to pay half of the rent. In light areas, it is also about one-third. But now the landlord cannot really collect enough rent. According to our method, we guarantee that the landlord will receive half of the rent amount in land price for fourteen years, and will not have to pay taxes. It is also equivalent to guaranteeing the landlord's livelihood for fourteen years. If China is stable and progressing from now on, and is industrialized, the landlords will not have to worry about a way to make a living after fourteen years. Even the small landlords with orphans and widows will have fourteen years of net rent income, their lives are guaranteed, and they can also have a way out in the future. Otherwise, if the landlords still insist on protecting their vested interests and are unwilling to take this path of peaceful reform, I am afraid that one day, it will not be possible to protect the safety of their lives. Isn't the peasant rebellion led by the Communist Party an obvious fact? Therefore, after the Association's plan was announced, many enlightened landlords sent letters expressing their support, and said that they could not collect the rent now, but the land tax burden was very heavy. They said that our method was to liberate them.</p>
<p>(6) For the government's sake: No matter how heavy the actual levy is now, the actual collection does not reach one-thirtieth of the national agricultural products. This is because there are too many problems with the tax collection, and the system and calculation methods are too difficult, such as converting taels to yuan and converting yuan to actual objects. This set is still a continuation of the land tax of the former Qing Dynasty, which only facilitates the corruption of the middlemen. We, like Mr. Wu Jingchao, hope that the government will clean up the tax system in one fell swoop. In this transitional period, it is happy to say that 10% of the land's normal crop yield will be collected. The one-tenth tax is an ancient system in China, and farmers have faith in it. Each county should determine a grade for the amount of crop yield for upper, middle, and lower fields, and the government will levy taxes accordingly; and re-stipulate the standard for the division of central and local governments, and absolutely prohibit adding any apportionment to the land. Chinese farmers are the most honest and obedient, and they will never evade reasonable and legal taxes. In the past, first, the tax system was chaotic, and second, the landlords owed and evaded taxes in various ways, so the government's tax revenue was usually "the actual collection did not reach half of the "nominal collection." If we follow our method, plus the collective tax payment organization, the government's tax revenue must increase several times, and all apportionments can be cancelled without worrying about no way to cover expenditures. Mr. Wu Jingchao is worried that the farmers will get land and increase the apportionment. If the government reforms the land, but is unwilling to handle these simple and easy tax reforms, how can such a government implement land reform?</p>
<p>(7) Finally, Mr. Wu and many other newspapers believe that it is not enough for farmers to only obtain these small plots of land to solve the problem. We have heard this argument often. But today's China must first solve today's problems, and then talk about the perfect plan for tomorrow. If we only think about the perfect plan for tomorrow and are unwilling to solve today's survival problems, then it is really like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger, which is of no practical help. Our first step is to give farmers land, and then we will gradually merge fields, increase harvests, and even gradually implement the large farm system. We need to enable too many farmers to switch to industry and commerce, so that farmers can get more land on average. But this matter cannot be resolved unless the country is stable and the economy embarks on the road to industrialization. This is the time to "rescue the dying without delay." How can we solve the problem with those empty plans? We are willing to "be humble and have no lofty arguments" and solve the realistic problems. We hope that all wise people can recognize the seriousness of China's problems today and unanimously advocate solving the peasant problem first to seek China's stability. All further construction plans should wait until China escapes the threat of death.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Wu's words, it seems that there are not many tenant farmers in the northern provinces, and this plan does not really solve the problem. I would like to add that this plan is not a panacea. It can solve all problems. But it is indeed seeking a reasonable solution for the most important part of China's problems first. There are not many tenant farmers in the northern provinces, but the problem of these few tenant farmers demanding land has brewed such a big disaster of the Communist Party's rebellion. Social rebellion does not really require everyone to rise up. If 20% of the people rebel, the remaining 80% will have to follow. Moreover, about 20% of the tenant farmers is a large enough number. The Communist Party is very clever and can grasp "land reform" as the main basis for rebellion. Otherwise, why doesn't the Communist Party take other issues? What does Mr. Wu think?</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] After the Sino-American Mount Jishi Exploration Team officially announced its conclusion on the 9th, it has become a historical term. The plan for our country to complete the exploration on its own can only be expected to be realized after autumn. The Chinese Committee of the team held a closing meeting today. Sino-American scientists have mutually assured that this failure will not affect future cooperation between the Sino-American scientific communities. The meeting also passed a motion expressing gratitude for the efforts and contributions of Mr. Ben Dong, Secretary-General of the Academia Sinica and Chairman of the Chinese Committee, and Mr. Hua Xipeng, Director of the Boston Museum and representative of the American scientists. In his speech, Mr. Sa said: "Scientists should be able to accept fruitless failures when conducting research." Mr. Sa also said: The task of the Chinese Committee has come to an end. The matter of the Central Aviation Corporation providing an aircraft to complete the exploration must be organized separately, and it is expected to be realized in the autumn. At that time, it is hoped that aerial and ground surveys will be carried out simultaneously. Mr. Sa also said: Hua Xipeng has faithfully completed his duties, and this failure has nothing to do with him.

<p>[Special Dispatch from Taipei, 10th] The Provincial Information Office held a press conference today, and Ma Shouhua, Chairman of the Materials Adjustment Committee, reported on the committee's business and price control situation. Mr. Ma said: The committee's task is to enable the people to obtain low-priced benefits, and does not seek to increase the provincial treasury. According to statistics, from June last year to March this year, the export amount was more than 1 billion yuan, with camphor accounting for the majority, and the import amount was 1.4 billion yuan, with food and fertilizers accounting for the majority. The supply of materials was 1.3 billion yuan (all in Taiwan dollars). Mr. Ma emphasized the misunderstanding of the mainland regarding the transportation and sale of materials from Taiwan. In fact, this province cannot even supply the timber and coal needed by the mainland. Therefore, there are still seven kinds of materials that are currently prohibited from exporting commercially: grain, alcohol, timber, camphor, coal, hardware, and fertilizer. As for camphor, tea, and pineapple, which are relied upon to exchange for foreign exchange, they have not been sold well due to the impact of international market competition. The committee currently holds 400 tons of camphor, 120,000 boxes of pineapple, and 2.4 million pounds of tea to be sold. As for what this province urgently needs to import now, it is fertilizer, cloth, flour, and wheat.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Aeronautical Dispatch, 7th] At the beginning of the month, when Nie Rongzhen's 16th and 2nd Columns turned westward from Chahar South, the winds of war rose in Sui East and Sui South. Fu Zuoyi immediately flew back to Suiyuan to deploy everything. On the 4th, the National Army was already concentrated in Guisui and Jining. Fu Zuoyi boarded a plane to return east, and disembarked briefly at Jining. After convening the newly appointed 35th Army Commander Guo Jingyun and others to instruct them on matters, he boarded the plane and took off again. When the plane left the runway and rose to a height of one room, General Fu walked into the iron door of the cockpit and ordered the pilot to "fly to Beiping." As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly fell to the door of the cockpit. It turned out that one of the plane's engines had caught fire. Although the pilot calmly shut off the throttle and made an almost right-angle emergency turn to descend, the fuselage had lost its balance and fell from the air into the fields. Only one wheel touched the ground upon landing, and it immediately overturned. The fuselage suddenly shook, and everyone inside the plane fell and passed out. Only one person, half-conscious and half-dazed, groped for the door, but could not open it.</p>
<p>Commander Guo Chases the Crashed Plane</p>
<p>When the ascending plane tilted sharply, Commander Guo Jingyun, who was seeing him off at the airfield, saw that the situation was bad and immediately chased after the plane in a jeep. When he arrived at the fallen field, he opened the door from the outside and saw General Fu's head falling into the cockpit and his feet stretching into the cabin. He was still unconscious. Fortunately, when the plane initially tilted, he was standing and talking to the driver, so he was the first to fall.</p>
<p>No Severe Shaking, Only Surface Scratches</p>
<p>He was not subjected to the severe shaking of the later landing and overturning, so only his back had some minor scratches. The other attendants were more seriously injured. Commander Guo led people to carry the people on the plane off the plane for more than ten minutes before the unconscious gradually woke up. As for the plane, one minute after the people on the plane were carried off, the fuel tank exploded and the entire fuselage was burned. If it had been a minute later, all rescue would have been useless. It is said that when the plane was taking Fu from Zhangfei to Suiyuan, the engine had already been making unusual noises. After some repairs in Guisui, it had improved, but who knew it would eventually crash in Jining?</p>
<p>Liu Yongsheng Treated in Guisui</p>
<p>Liu Yongsheng, deputy director of the operations office, and Captain Zhang of the guard team, who were most trusted by General Fu and always accompanied him, were more seriously injured and are now being treated in Guisui. General Fu flew back to the capital on the 5th on a plane newly dispatched from Beiping. Chiefs from military and political circles all went to the western suburbs to express their condolences. Fu's injuries were indeed very light, and he could already pick up a newspaper and read it with his arm. (Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Jianfu)</p>
<p>Escape Can Be Called a Miracle</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guisui, 10th] The escape of General Fu Zuoyi from the plane crash in Jining on the 4th can be called a major miracle in history. According to eyewitnesses, Fu Zuoyi arrived in Jining by special plane at noon on the 4th, accompanied by staff members Zhi Renjie, adjutant Zhang Jingtao, etc. He immediately convened a military conference of senior generals. At 1:45 PM, he took off in the original plane, rising extremely quickly. Before reaching 200 meters, the tail of the plane caught fire. At that time, Fu was walking into the cockpit to tell the pilot to fly directly to Beiping, originally scheduled to fly to Zhangyuan. The plane crashed at this time in a hollow between two high hills. If it had deviated to the left or right, there would have been no way to escape. The plane landed sideways, so the wings were destroyed and the door faced the sky. Zhi Renjie hurriedly pulled the door, but could not open it. Zhang Jingtao was strong and powerful, and rushed forward to pull it open, but his arm was seriously injured. When the plane crashed, Fu had just left the cockpit and had not yet sat down, so he was knocked down and lost consciousness. The pilot and attendants carried him out of the cabin, but the cabin was filled with smoke and difficult to breathe. The moment Fu and all the personnel left the fuselage, the fuselage exploded with a loud noise and was completely destroyed. Everyone saw that Fu was covered in blood and unconscious, so they immediately rescued him. He soon woke up and asked what happened. He was told that the plane had been evacuated. Upon examining the blood on his body, it was discovered that the electrician in the plane had knocked out all his teeth, and was lying on Fu's body in the cabin, and all the bloodstains were from the electrician's mouth.</p>
<p>Normal Office Hours on the Afternoon of the 5th</p>
<p>When Fu took off, he forbade senior generals from seeing him off. When the police at the airfield issued a report, the senior generals rushed to the airfield, and Fu had already returned by the airfield car. On the way, he encountered a wounded soldier, and ordered the car to stop and take care of him. That night, he rested at the Jining Garrison Headquarters. The next morning, he took another plane back to Beiping. In the afternoon of the 5th, someone in Beiping received the news and went to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters to visit, and Fu was already working as usual. This time, all the personnel on the plane were unharmed except for Deputy Adjutant Zhang Jingtao, who was injured and sent to the hospital. Fu only had a scratch on his forehead and a slight bruise on his left hip. After a doctor's examination, everything inside was normal.</p>
<p>Miraculous Escape Is Amazing</p>
<p>This is the third time that Fu has escaped from a plane crash. The first time was after the Xi'an Incident, when he took off from Suiyuan at night to rescue Chairman Chiang and got lost, and was forced to land in the mountains of Yixian, Hebei. Both the people and the plane were safe. The second time was in the autumn of the year before last, when he flew from Suiyuan to the sky over Liangcheng and experienced a malfunction. He urgently returned to Suiyuan and landed. After leaving the plane, the fuselage was burned. The wreckage of the plane is still parked at the Suiyuan airfield.</p>
<p>National Assembly Sends Telegram to Console Commander-in-Chief Fu</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 10th] The National Assembly representatives were very concerned when they learned that Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters had been slightly injured in a plane crash. Today, they decided to send a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Fu on behalf of the Assembly to express their condolences. The original telegram is as follows: "To Commander-in-Chief Fu of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Beiping: You, sir, with your great talent for strategy, have been entrusted with the important task of a thousand cities. Your suppression of the rebellion has been outstanding. Every time we hear of your victories, we are deeply admired. The Assembly has decided to express its condolences.

<p>[Central News Agency Lanzhou, 10th] The case of the free professional groups here voting to impeach City Senator Wang Zhongying, which set a national precedent for the people to exercise the right of recall, was held today. The result was that more than two-thirds of the members voted to complete the impeachment procedure. According to reports, Wang Zhongying, as a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, was selected as a city senator of the Lanzhou Free Professional Group through a lottery. In previous meetings, he never sought the opinions of the groups he represented, nor did he speak or propose a case for the groups he represented. Moreover, he relied on his identity as a senator to forcibly occupy public property, coerce nuns, and falsely accuse merchants. Earlier, more than 200 members of the News Reporter and Western Medicine Doctor Associations jointly signed a petition to impeach Wang Zhongying on the grounds that he was incompetent and had poor behavior. Today, they completed the voting procedure according to law. On the eve of the country's constitutional government, this advocacy of the people exercising the right to recall in addition to the right to elect has great significance for the future of democratic politics.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Riot in Downtown Bogota, Situation Confused, Revolution Suddenly Breaks Out in Colombia. President Velez Is Negotiating with the Left-Wing Opposition Party. Pan-American Conference Suspended, Marshall and Others Are Safe. <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] The bloody rebellion of the Colombian left-wing against the conservative government had not yet revealed its trend by dawn on the 10th. At the same time, mobs continued to flood the Colombian capital of Bogota. International wireless communication with the area ended on the evening of the 9th. The only direct source of information on this question is the State Department's report, which states that the Colombian capital has become a scene of carnage. US Ambassador Butler reported to Secretary of State Marshall that Commerce Secretary Harriman and other Americans "are safe, but exhausted." The fire outside the embassy has been contained. The State Department has received eyewitness accounts stating that the rebels did not encounter resistance from government forces. The delegates attending the Pan-American Conference were unharmed, but due to the looting of food, the delegates and more than 420,000 residents are feeling panicked about food supplies. Two or three American journalists reported eyewitness accounts stating that the riots showed no signs of abating. Delegates attending the conference have apparently decided to continue the conference in that location or elsewhere. American journalists believe the location will be moved elsewhere. Marshall has not yet indicated that he will lead the delegation back to the United States, and it is expected that he will try to keep the conference going. Colombian Vice President Santos, who is currently in New York, said that President Velez and opposition Liberal leaders are discussing solutions, "possibly on the premise of the president's resignation." He also said that 30 people died in the rebellion. Santos said that the best solution would be to expand the government to include Liberal figures. Colombian Chief Representative to the United Nations Lopez confirmed that Velez was still in power late on the 9th and was consulting with the opposition.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall is now staying outside the Colombian capital, waiting for the situation to unfold.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] The Colombian capital of Bogota was shrouded in a state of uneasy silence on the 10th. The anti-government left-wing rebellion has declared a reduction in momentum, but the outcome is still uncertain. The fires set by the mobs are still smoldering, but there is no one in the middle of the streets. The military police have disappeared from the streets, abandoning control of the situation, and it is believed that the army is concentrated in the presidential palace to defend President Velez.</p>
<p>[Reuters Bogota, 10th] After the Colombian Liberal Party launched a revolution to seize the government radio station in an attempt to overthrow President Velez and his government, the conservative government of Velez seemed to have regained control of the capital today. Velez issued a communiqué at 1:20 AM standard time on the 10th, broadcasting on the regained radio station that the assassinated Liberal leader Gaitan was apparently harmed by pro-Communist elements. He also said: "Although there are still minor skirmishes and riots in the city, the army is able to grasp the situation, and the government has also taken measures to restore order." The building where the Pan-American Conference was being held was also stormed by mobs, and the conference was suspended. Post-劫 Bogota is like London after the German bombing. The radio station, which was previously in the hands of the rebels, announced that the Liberal Party-appointed interim president Escandara had entered the presidential palace in an attempt to force Velez to resign. Communist Party member Baria, a Bogota local advisor to the General Confederation of Labor, also ordered supporters of the Liberal Party to go to the streets with weapons or any iron objects to participate in the revolution. The US Consul in Cali, Colombia's third largest city, reported that the revolutionaries, with the support of army and police personnel, had taken control of the city of Cali. According to broadcasts from the revolutionary side, clashes with conservatives occurred when the government radio station was taken over, and four people from the Liberal side and students died. At the National Congress Building, where the Pan-American Conference was being held, conservative police fired intermittently at the crowd.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Bogota, 10th] Colombian President Velez issued a communiqué on the 10th stating that the unrest was instigated by the Communist Party. The President called on the Colombian people to take united action to fight totalitarianism. At the same time, the Liberal Party headquarters issued a declaration stating that the Liberal Party will no longer persuade Velez to resign as president, and will call on the people to launch an armed uprising in order to achieve the success of the revolution.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Liberal Party Leader Gaitan Assassinated, Major Cause of Riots in Bogota. Three Major Government Figures Killed by the People. <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Colombia Capital, 9th] Colombia today experienced a revolution, government offices were occupied, and a new government has been established. At least eight people were killed when armed civilians rose up in the capital, including one current government minister. The trigger for the revolution was the assassination of opposition Liberal Party leader and 1950 presidential candidate Gaitan last night. As soon as this news spread, the people were outraged and rushed to the streets with various weapons, smashing glass doors and windows, and the entire city was in chaos.</p>
<p>Armed crowds swarmed to the presidential palace, shouting "Kill Gomez!" Gomez is the leader of the Conservative Party of the government faction and is currently the head of the Colombian delegation to the Pan-American Conference. The assassin who shot Gaitan was also killed by the crowd, dragged to the front of the presidential palace, and dismembered to vent their anger. Most of the military police apparently agreed with the revolutionary masses, and only those loyal to the current President Velez fired at those attempting to break into the presidential palace. Armed crowds then occupied the radio station and broadcast in the name of the Liberal Party Revolutionary Committee, stating that the Liberal Party had taken over the government and controlled everything. Dr. Escandara has taken office as interim president, pending the arrival of Liberal Vice President Santos in the capital. Gaitan was shot on a street near his office, sent to the hospital, and underwent surgery to save his life. An hour later, he died of his injuries. Upon hearing the news, about 1,000 people quickly rushed to the National Congress Building, smashing windows, destroying furniture, and setting fire to several houses. The guards were outnumbered and apparently unwilling to interfere. The National Congress Building is where the current Pan-American Conference is being held. Gunfire could be heard in the square in front of the door, and the reception room was also affected by the chaos. News reporters went to great lengths to get out. The masses then marched towards the presidential palace. Afterwards, the army arrived, but hesitated because the masses shouted "Long live Colombia! Long live the people!" In the end, they remained still. At that time, Gomez, Minister of Mines Montiel, and another Conservative Party leader Valencia had been killed.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse Milan, 9th] Today, aircraft from Italy, France, and the United States held joint aerial maneuvers. The aircraft took off from airfields in Italy and France and flew around the Mediterranean Sea between Corsica and Liguria, pretending that an American flying fortress had fallen there. Before returning to their respective bases, the aircraft made patrol flights.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 9th] The Italian government said on the 9th that the most critical period in Italy will come immediately after the national election on April 18, but added that the military police are now ready and even airborne troops have been ordered to deal with any situation. Deputy Prime Minister Bachiati held a special meeting and assured the country that the election would be absolutely free and peaceful. He said, "The government has planned far ahead to ensure freedom of voting and public order before, during, and after the election. The government's preparations can be said to be perfect. Even in the most remote areas where it is extremely difficult for the military police to reach, the most subtle problems will be addressed with all our efforts." Since the start of the election campaign, there have been 200 political gatherings disrupted due to poor order, 13 people have been killed in political assassinations, and 64 others have been hospitalized due to injuries. The Election Truce Commission is meeting in this atmosphere. Communist leader Togliatti chaired the passage of a resolution at the meeting, calling on the country to accept the results of the election with a "calm and peaceful" attitude, in order to show that "Italy is ready to accept the test of democracy." Italians had previously worried that if the left-wing front failed, the Communist Party might take direct action. Togliatti's remarks have slightly dispelled the haze.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] Allied observers believe the Western powers have already decided to ease the tension in Berlin. This can be seen in the decision by the four powers not to convene the Four-Power Allied Control Council meeting on April 10th, the conciliatory tone in the letter from British Commander Robertson to Soviet Commander Sokolovsky regarding the plane crash, and Robertson's agreement that the crash investigation should be conducted by Britain and the Soviet Union, rather than all four powers.</p>
<p>As for Britain, Robertson's speech in Düsseldorf, while promoting the organization of a new political structure to allow West Germany to be incorporated into Western Europe, also showed Britain taking a less provocative attitude towards the Berlin crisis than the United States. Britain did not announce a large-scale airlift system after the Soviet Union tightened control over land transportation, and the armed guards sent by the Soviet army to the British sector radio station in Berlin were not expelled by the British. British officials believe that if a break with the Soviet Union over German political issues is to occur, it should not be caused by dangerous events and an atmosphere of alarming rumors.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 10th] British Commander Robertson today submitted a reply to the Soviet authorities, abandoning the demand for a four-nation investigation into the British-Soviet plane crash and accepting the Soviet suggestion for a joint British-Soviet investigation. The reply did not mention sending fighter jets to protect flights, but only stated that British aircraft had been instructed to strictly adhere to aviation regulations. When the special envoy delivered the reply to the Soviet headquarters, Sokolovsky was not in Berlin. Some observers speculate that he may have been summoned back to his country to consult with the government given the tense four-power relations in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th] British reporters here commenting on the content of Robertson's note said, "It seems to have been written in Sokolovsky's office." American reporters also commented, "Britain is definitely on a downward slope."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Geneva, 9th] The First Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information discussed this afternoon the draft proposal submitted by the Chinese delegation regarding various conveniences for the transmission and dissemination of news.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 9th] The Second Subcommittee of the Conference on Freedom of Information, by a vote of twenty-two to one (Belgium), passed the proposal of the Chinese delegate Zhang Pengchun, asserting that foreign journalists have complete freedom to send news abroad, but foreign news agencies may not publish local news without the consent of local news agencies and local newspapers.</p>

<p>(15) The Crisis in Southeastern China</p>
<p>In 1944, Japan opened up a mainland corridor from south to north in China, thereby connecting Manchuria with the conquered areas of Southeast Asia—Indochina, Siam, Malaya, and Burma—via a transportation line.</p>
<p>Now, from a historical perspective, this effort was merely a death throe of a mortally wounded enemy, but at the time, it almost liquidated the resistance of the Chinese National Government and the investments made by the United States over three years under Sino-American wartime cooperation.</p>
<p>No effective plan was developed to counter this offensive. The only forces available were the small 14th Air Force, the fledgling Chinese Air Force, and the Chinese army, which had never received a single ton of American aid; even if there was some aid later, it was too late.</p>
<p>In February 1944, when I first warned General Stilwell of the enemy's threat, I requested 8,000 tons of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies in March for Sino-American aircraft, but I actually received less than half of that amount.</p>
<p>In mid-April, just before the offensive was launched, I protested that this delivery method would not allow for the storage of materials, and it would bring to a halt our increasingly effective attacks on Japanese ships, airfields, and transportation lines.</p>
<p>At that time, the attacks on Japanese ships had already passed the experimental stage. Approximately 56,900 tons of enemy merchant ships and two gunboats had been sunk, of which 16,700 tons were sunk by the 14th Air Force in January alone. We had hopes of sinking at least 150,000 tons of Japanese ships per month. At the same time, B-24 aircraft equipped with radar were preparing to sweep the China Sea as far as the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, the restrictions on cargo tonnage that I have pointed out above made it impossible to stockpile the supplies necessary to support the Chinese army in preventing the impending Japanese offensive. I argued strongly that the enemy's offensive would threaten the safety of the entire Free China, including the B-29 bases then nearing completion near Chengdu in Sichuan Province. The air defense of the Superfortress bases was entirely entrusted to the 14th Air Force under my command.</p>
<p>Stilwell's first response was to say that the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not give me priority for Hump supplies because the Japanese expedition in Burma still threatened Imphal and the Hump air transport base in the Brahmaputra Valley of India. The fact was that Stilwell's Burma operations required a large number of supplies from the Hump.</p>
<p>Stilwell told me that air force activities within China should only be reduced.</p>
<p>Past records will show that my predictions regarding the nature of the Japanese offensive were quite accurate. The latter was launched in April in the Yellow River region of Henan Province, and in the following month, it was launched again in Hunan Province on the south bank of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Because the 8,000 tons I requested for March had been cut by nearly half, and the request for April had been cut almost as severely, I suggested that the April quantity be restored first, with at least 8,000 tons for May, and then increasing to 8,000 tons per month thereafter.</p>
<p>In addition, I proposed an alternative: temporarily allocate the fuel stockpiled near Chengdu for B-29 use, and if future emergencies required it, replace the B-29's planned attacks on the areas surrounding China with strategic attacks within China.</p>
<p>I frankly told General Stilwell that unless action was taken in accordance with one of the above methods, then it would be necessary to notify Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek that he could no longer rely on our air force to provide effective support for his troops, and also to notify Washington that the security of the entire China was seriously affected.</p>
<p>Stilwell's reply was still that the crisis within India made it impossible to improve Hump air transport and increase supplies to China, and Chiang Kai-shek should not expect the 14th Air Force to do the impossible. However, after this exchange of views, I received one of the strangest orders I had received since taking office as the senior American Air Force officer in China.</p>
<p>This order made defending the Chengdu area the top priority of the 14th Air Force, even at the expense of abandoning attacks on enemy ships and support for Chinese ground troops, even though the Chinese ground troops were facing their greatest test at the time.</p>
<p>The order was sent in the form of a letter from General Stratemeyer, commander of the U.S. Air Force in the India-Burma Theater of the China-Burma-India Theater, but the letter stated that Stilwell also held the same view.</p>
<p>The ostensible reason for this directive was that I had expressed doubts about our ability to defend the B-29 bases, whereas what I actually needed to raise was the security of the entire China. I never raised the question of defense of the Chengdu base alone.</p>
<p>At that time, the 14th Air Force headquarters in Kunming and the main Chinese terminus of the Hump route were being defended by a fighter squadron, while two squadrons of fighters were defending Chengdu, so the defense of Chengdu was stronger than that of Kunming.</p>
<p>Historically, the main task of the 14th Air Force has been to defend the air terminus of the Hump route in China and to support Chinese ground troops in the air. I was forced to point this out to Stilwell, hoping he would not tie my hands with contrary orders.</p>
<p>I assured him that the air defense of the Chengdu area was child's play compared to helping stop the Japanese offensive then underway in Henan and preparing to support the Chinese Expeditionary Force, which would soon cross the Salween River into Burma.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the most elite troops in China at that time, namely the Salween River Expeditionary Force, were about to engage in operations outside of China under Stilwell's pressure, while the Japanese army had already begun to cut off southeastern China!</p>
<p>When the crisis in China broke out, Stilwell and Stratemeyer were talking about the air defense of the Chengdu area alone, a problem that did not actually exist. Stilwell finally dropped the matter, implying that I had been making unnecessary noise before.</p>
<p>He spent some time somewhere in Burma. There he sent a radio telegram in which he said sarcastically that he found the air defense problem in Chengdu did not exist, "which was quite comforting." This seemed to please him very much, as he remained inactive on the Chinese crisis until months later, by which time the fate of eastern China had been sealed.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Communist Bandits Conspire to Launch Full-Scale Student Unrest; Arrested Jinan University Student Provides Detailed Inside Information; Party, Government, and Military Hold Joint Meeting for Detailed Discussion <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the matter of Communist bandits planning to launch full-scale student unrest in this city, a joint meeting of the party, government, and military of this city was solemnly held yesterday afternoon in the city hall auditorium. The meeting was personally presided over by Mayor Wu. In addition to key figures from the party, government, and military, presidents of colleges and universities in the city were also invited to attend to conduct a thorough discussion of the student unrest issue. The meeting lasted from 3:30 PM to around 7:00 PM, and the contents were kept confidential.</p>
<p>According to a statement released yesterday by the city government's news office, the situation of the student conflict at National Jinan University has already been reported by various newspapers. The following is the truth of the matter according to a statement released by the police department: On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, students at the school posted a public notice exposing that the purpose of a trip to Hangzhou by a small number of students to enjoy the spring was to publicly commemorate Yu Zisan, launch student unrest, and respond to the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu's conspiracy to cross the Yangtze River on the 5th. The students who traveled to Hangzhou found out about this and tore down the notice, posting another notice in its place with wanton insults. As a result, a fight broke out. Student Tian Ganwu was seriously injured in the fight. On the afternoon of the 9th, students at the school were indignant because student Tian Ganwu was injured by the students who traveled to Hangzhou, and another fight broke out. Students Wang Zongshu and Yin Zhenmin were also injured. It was also discovered that student Wang Zongyi was a Communist bandit cadre, and Cui Weijie (female) was strongly suspected of being a Communist bandit. That evening, they were sent to the North Station Police Sub-bureau for interrogation. After questioning, Wang Zongyi expressed his willingness to confess and provided a written confession (a copy of the confession and statement is attached). He described in detail his experience participating in Communist bandit activities and named Cui Weijie as one of the leading figures of the Communist Party in the school. Therefore, yesterday morning, the North Station Police Sub-bureau transferred Wang and Cui to the police headquarters for legal action.</p>
<p>The police department attaches great importance to this case. However, students who participate in Communist bandit activities are generally weak-willed and temporarily misled and go astray. It is hoped that they will awaken to the error of their ways and immediately surrender to the bureau. The authorities will be magnanimous, not hold them accountable for the past, and provide them with security guarantees. Furthermore, regarding rumors that students were beaten to death in the Jinan University student brawl, the police department officially declares that the rumors are absolutely false. The names of the Communist bandits confessed by Wang Zongyi have been communicated by the police department to the school authorities, students' parents, and guarantors, and personnel were dispatched to the school at 9:00 PM last night (the 10th) for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Wang Zongyi's Confession: First, as a Probationary Party Member Under Observation; Small Group Meetings Held Weekly at Fudan University <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The following is an excerpt from the confession and statement of Jinan University student Wang Zongyi: (1) Organizational Relationships: I was introduced to join the Communist Party by Ye Jinwen from Fudan University. Because my identity is that of an intellectual from a landlord family, according to Ye, "According to Party rules, intellectuals from landlord families can only be probationary party members first." At that time, I wrote an autobiography and an article on my views on the current situation, which were forwarded by Ye. Since then, I have had an organizational relationship with Ye. Because I am a probationary party member, I must wait for two and a half years of observation, so my organizational horizontal relationship must be under Ye's command. Except for the small group discussion meetings held weekly at Fudan University and the occurrence of horizontal relationships with ××× and others, no other horizontal relationships are allowed to occur. As for the direct command from the upper level, Ye is responsible. My lower-level task is to "unite" and "organize" students in the Chemistry Department of Jinan University. Because I am a probationary party member, I have no right to introduce party members, so no party organizational relationship has occurred at the lower level.</p>
<p>Daredevil Team; Responsible for Propaganda Work</p>
<p>(2) Work Plan: The work plan is divided into organizational work and regular work. Organizational work involves holding small group meetings every week to review the current situation and the progress and difficulties of regular work. The sole purpose of regular work is to recruit party members, and all launching of "student unrest" and striving for student unions are for this goal. Because I am a probationary party member, I am only responsible for propaganda work, that is, to be a daredevil for them. The work of contacting and exposing a wide range of students is done by probationary party members. Regarding propaganda methods, they are divided into oral and written. The type of book must be determined by the students' acceptance conditions, that is, using a method of seduction to gradually confuse the students. The oral propaganda method is to first explain the bitterness of the profession and the economic distress to the students. After the students feel sympathy, then conduct political propaganda. After one propaganda after another, the students will become confused.</p>
<p>Striving for Public Funding as the Goal; Full-Scale Launch in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou</p>
<p>The instructions on the development of the recent war situation are to complete the spring offensive before May, that is, to expand the occupation in North China and isolate Beijing and Tianjin. In northern Jiangsu, the base is sound and consolidated. In the northeast, after occupying Changchun, troops will enter the pass, so that the source of soldiers in North China can be used for crossing the river. After the spring offensive is completed, the large-scale crossing of the river will begin in May. During the crossing of the river, Communist party members in various schools will strive for public funding as the main goal and launch full-scale student unrest in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. After the student unrest is instigated, Communist party members in the labor sector will instigate labor unrest, creating a full-scale disruption. If the river crossing is successful, Communist party members from various schools will gradually induce students to enter the guerrilla areas south of the Yangtze River to participate in work, so that the foundation of the occupation can be "consolidated" quickly.</p>

<p>The spring vacation is the best time for us to use, so we took the name of touring Hangzhou to discuss the steps for all activities and the means to be taken. Because Zhejiang University in Hangzhou is our general liaison and guidance agency for Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi, it completely obeys the Hong Kong branch. ××× and others from Zhejiang University are directly in charge of this liaison and guidance agency. After arriving in Hangzhou, we settled some neutral students, and then we began to carry out our work. At about 2:00 AM on April 2nd, we gathered comrades from our school ××× and comrades from outside to discuss the work plan and how to carry out propaganda to win over neutral students. The discussion and resolution were: (1) Launch external organizations, such as the YMCA and the Women's Student Association, etc. (2) Form a Poor Student Mutual Aid Society to launch a full-scale public funding movement to create full-scale student unrest. (3) Launch the "One School, One Thing" movement to achieve the goal of the May riot. (4) Join forces with worker comrades and incite labor unrest, etc.</p>
<p>The travel expenses this time were subsidized by the top level with 20 million yuan. Several people from our school, including ×××, regularly attended joint meetings of various schools. At 8:00 AM on the 5th, a public memorial was held for Martyr Yu Zisan: Comrade ××× represented the Jinan University Student Union and gave a speech, the content of which was as follows: "Today, more than a thousand students from Shanghai and Hangzhou who are fighting for true democracy have gathered at the tomb of Martyr Yu to mourn. We feel very sad and very angry at the same time. Although the environment is harsh, we are still working very hard and struggling for democracy. We students from Shanghai will continue to expand the movement after we go back to give full play to greater strength. Now is the time, we should strengthen unity and use action to achieve the ideals of the true democratic movement."</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] There are two confessions from Wang Zongyi. The one published above is the handwritten confession at the Police Headquarters yesterday morning. In addition, there is another one that was left at the North Station Sub-bureau the day before yesterday. Director Yu personally inquired about it, and the confession was very detailed. It is said that Wang Zongyi finally burst into tears, saying that he had been deceived and expressed his repentance. The police authorities originally planned to launch a large-scale arrest yesterday in an attempt to catch all the Communist bandits in one fell swoop. Later, in order to take social stability into account, only the names on Wang's confession were arrested and questioned. Further steps will be taken depending on the development of the case.</p>
<p>[Another report] Lin Yuyin, a female student in the third grade of Jinan University, was arrested yesterday noon. Tension immediately appeared in the school. Some students stayed overnight outside the school last night.</p>

<p>The entire body of prisoners in the Shanghai Prison of this city, who were sentenced to imprisonment for opium and drug-related cases, yesterday petitioned the Council, stating in brief: "The convicts, blinded by ignorance, strayed onto the wrong path, unwisely seeking profit, violated the laws, and now bear the consequences, confined within these walls, the taste of iron bars is unbearably bitter. Every time we think about it, we cannot help but feel guilt and remorse, weeping until our clothes are soaked. Moreover, the convicts believe that they are neither great robbers nor incorrigibly wicked. At this juncture, when the nation is establishing a constitutional government, we should be given a path to self-renewal. If there is not a single person in the country who is sorrowful, then virtue should be encouraged, fathers and sons, brothers exhorting each other, and we would not dare to test the law again and suffer unexpected punishment. Now we hear that the National Assembly is in session and the President will also be elected. Once the new government is formed, the nation will surely issue a general amnesty to celebrate the grand event and show the people a fresh start. We have always looked up to your Council as the voice of the people and respectfully request that you suggest to the government that if a general amnesty is issued, the convicts should not be excluded, so that the fish in the dried-up ruts can find water in the rivers and streams and regain the path to self-renewal," and so on.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Food Distribution Committee, during a spot check of rice shops on the 5th, discovered that the Ye Rentai rice shop in the Yimiao District had a discrepancy between the amount of rice in storage and the amount of payment submitted. Chen Zuoren, the commissioner stationed in the district by the Food Distribution Committee, and Guo Dahuan, the assistant, carefully examined the accounts and discovered that the payment for nine piculs and six pecks of distributed rice was short. Ye Guomin, the person in charge of the shop, under strict questioning, actually offered a bribe of 640,000 national currency to the investigators. Chen and Guo, believing that the shop not only failed to pay the grain dues but also attempted to commit fraud and dared to openly offer bribes, immediately asked Zhu Boya, the relevant field chief, to come to the shop. Ye Rentai of the shop issued a guarantee against bribery. The Food Distribution Committee has already sent the guarantee and the bribe money to the District Procuratorate yesterday for legal action.</p>
<p>Hoping Citizens Will Report Malfeasance</p>
<p>When the first group of rice shops in the Nanshi area of this city was delivering rice for the March ration distribution, one catty or half a catty of rice was deducted per picul to compensate for transportation losses. After receiving the report, the Food Distribution Committee stated that since rice shops are entrusted to pick up and transport, a 1.6% management fee (including packaging) has already been given, and they should not charge any fees from the rice shops. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee to thoroughly investigate, refund the compensation, and strictly prohibit it, the Committee also hopes that citizens will report such malfeasance.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Police Office of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications yesterday transferred a case of theft and smuggling of US dollars, requesting the District Procuratorate to investigate. The defendants are Zhu Liukun, Han Hailin, Zhu Wenmei, Yu Chenglong, Cui Qianlin, Tan Shaoguang, and six others. The Police Office received a tip that on February 25th at 10:00 AM, a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight arrived in this city from San Francisco, USA, suspected of smuggling US dollars. The Police Office sent personnel to investigate and discovered that Zhu Liukun, a ground worker at the airport, had stolen US dollars and fled. Subsequently, it was discovered that Zhu had traveled extensively in the Suzhou and Hangzhou area, indulging in prostitution and extravagant spending, with an uncertain whereabouts. It was also discovered that Zhu had US dollars hidden at his sister Wenmei's place, and 200 US dollars and a broken watch were seized during a search. According to Wenmei's confession, her brother had deposited 600 US dollars with her and later took away 400 US dollars. It was further discovered that Zhu often frequented the singer Jinni (Yuying) in Suzhou, and 2.3 US dollars were found at Jin's place. On the 27th of last month, Zhu was arrested at the Da Sanyuan Restaurant. According to Zhu's confession, at 2:00 PM on February 25th, he and another ground worker, Yu Chenglong, were cleaning the plane. Yu discovered a yellow leather bag behind the radio operator's seat in the cockpit and immediately reported it to a foreign employee named Nash. Nash was panicked upon hearing this and told them not to make a sound before leaving in a hurry. Zhu and Yu opened the bag and saw more than 7,000 US dollars inside, realizing that they were smuggling US dollars. They then reported it to the foreman, Han Hailin. Han and others, after discussing it together, believed that since it was illegally smuggled US dollars, it would be okay to take the ill-gotten wealth. They then conceived the idea of theft, took out the US dollars, and divided them equally in the air-raid shelter. Han received 2,700 US dollars, Yu received 2,360 US dollars, and Zhu received 2,300 US dollars. Zhu fled immediately after stealing the money. CNAC foreign employee Kleven questioned Han Hailin and promised a bonus if the money was recovered. Han completely blamed Zhu. The Police Office successively arrested Zhu, Yu, Han, and suspects Cui Qianlin and Tan Shaowen and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. As for foreign employees Nash and Kleven, who are suspected of smuggling US dollars, although they vehemently denied it, the Civil Aviation Administration has restricted them from leaving CNAC before the investigation at the District Procuratorate is completed.</p>

The countries with which we have begun direct exchange are the US Bureau of Narcotics and the United Nations Narcotics Board, and we plan to gradually extend this to other neighboring countries in the Far East and all contracting countries in the world. Japan was the main base for the war-time poisoning of China and international smuggling in the Far East, with traces all over the world. India, Vietnam, and the Dutch territories are historically opium-producing areas, and they implemented the opium monopoly system in the past and are adjacent to our country, so we should first and foremost pay attention to them, he said.</p>

In his spare time, he often chatted with his uncle at No. 52, Hengmao Lane, and learned that Li Yuxiang, a tenant in the same building's pavilion room, had considerable savings and was addicted to opium. Therefore, he conceived the idea of robbery. Based on this statement, the police officers rushed to Li's residence and found him with an opium-filled face.

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The District Court in the Yan Peixing case is scheduled to summon Yan Peixing tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM to determine whether he has mental illness. The summons has been served yesterday. Yan Peixing himself recently asked Han Fen, a Western-trained doctor and professor of neuropsychiatry at St. John's University and director of the neuropsychiatry department at Gongji Hospital, to examine him. The result of his examination report stated: "Mr. Yan has a sensitive, easily traumatized, and poorly controlled emotional personality. He lacks sufficient self-confidence in the face of life's difficulties, resulting in emotional reactions when facing the hostility of others and a sense of helplessness. In addition, he is actually a mentally sound person, with absolutely no signs of mental breakdown or mental exhaustion, not only possessing complete judgment and reasonable thinking ability, but also possessing special talent in dealing with affairs." At the same time, the police station has not found any signs of Yan's mental disorder in recent summonses. Therefore, the mystery of whether Yan Peixing has mental illness will not be difficult to solve. Although the case has been mediated by powerful figures, it is difficult to predict whether it can be "turned into nothing" because the case has caused a stir in society.</p>
<p>Shortage of Property in the Factory</p>
<p>Regarding the civil part, when Yan Peixing and his wife Yuan Baoying confronted each other at the police station a few days ago, Yuan expressed her willingness to return the property in the factory. At that time, after both parties went to inspect it together, they found dozens of boxes of steel heddles, with very high value, were missing, so the dispute has not been resolved. The police station is conducting a general investigation in the criminal part, and it was heard that Hou Jiyuan was summoned yesterday.</p>

<p>Group Leader Huang Chunqing in Good Spirits, Composing a Quatrain in the Aircraft</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The domestic inspection group organized by the Taiwan Provincial Senators arrived in Shanghai yesterday, accompanied by Weng Qian, Deputy Director of Civil Affairs of the Taiwan Provincial Government. Mr. Weng, along with Huang Chunqing, the leader of the group, and group members Lu Yongkai, Liu Kuocai, Guo Guoji, Wu Ruitai, Ren Gongfan, Chen Wenshi, Huang Liandeng, Xie Hanru, Zhu Zaichang, Wang Yueqiao, and Chen Qingchi, thirteen people in total, took a CNAC flight and arrived at Longhua Airport at 1:30 PM. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the Bank of Taiwan went to the airport to welcome them. After the inspection group disembarked from the plane, they drove to the Jinmen Hotel to rest. The reporter then visited them and, according to Deputy Director Weng, told reporters, "The senators of our province love the motherland and support the government, and are deeply familiar with the circumstances. In order to understand the situation in various parts of the country, the inspection group has been organized. The purpose of this trip is to gain a better understanding of the politics, economy, and culture of various parts of the motherland, so that we can provide reference for the construction of a new Taiwan on the day of our return."</p>
<p>Love for the Motherland Has Never Been Forgotten</p>
<p>Huang Chunqing, the leader of the group, who is known for not serving as a Japanese official, not speaking Japanese, and not changing his Japanese name during the Japanese occupation, is 74 years old.

He was in excellent spirits in the aircraft and showed the reporter a poem improvised in the aircraft, saying: "The sea and sky are like a painting through the crystal window, the warm spring breeze sends silver wings in pairs, the journey of ten thousand miles is full of roads, the passenger plane carries dreams to Shanghai." He also told reporters, "The purpose of this group is to promote the solidarity between the motherland and the compatriots in Taiwan. In the past 50 years of brutal Japanese rule, they did not want the compatriots in Taiwan to know about the revolutionary movement in China that overthrew the Manchu Qing autocratic regime, so the pictures and newspapers published in China were not allowed to enter Taiwan, nor were the compatriots allowed to have collections of the Three Principles of the People, and they were not allowed to return to their ancestral homes in the country to sweep the tombs and worship their ancestors. Chinese or European and American dignitaries were forbidden from approaching the compatriots. However, the spirit of the compatriots loving the motherland has never been forgotten for a day. Now that we are in the year of constitutional government, the time of the general election, and the day of the National Assembly, we have formed a group to come here, hoping to make a small contribution to promoting unity."</p>
<p>Separate Visits to Heads of Institutions</p>
<p>The group will attend a cherry blossom viewing party and visit Fuxing Park this morning, and visit Zhongshan Park this afternoon. Some members of the group have also decided to enjoy the Peking opera performances of Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang. Tomorrow, they will separately visit the municipal headquarters of the Kuomintang, the Municipal Council, the Garrison Command, and other institutions, and visit major newspapers and factories in the city. After visiting Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM on the 13th, they will focus on the economic aspects and make a general inspection. They are scheduled to go to Hangzhou for sightseeing on the 15th, return to Shanghai on the 20th, and fly to Beiping on the 21st to visit the ancient capital and culture. They plan to stay for a week and then return to Shanghai and go to Beijing to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the first president on May 5. If time permits, they plan to visit Wuhan and Guangzhou, the birthplace of the revolution, and take the opportunity to go to their ancestral graves in Fujian and Guangdong to worship their ancestors.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Wang Zhixin Hosts the Press - Reports on the Handover of the Closing of the Exchange <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Brokers' Transaction Account Balance Reached More Than 2 Trillion</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mr. Wang Zhixin, general manager of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, hosted the press in this city at the exchange at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Mr. Wang gave a speech on the spot, describing in detail his feelings about the exchange complying with the order to suspend delivery. He said: "The delivery business of this exchange has recently been ordered to suspend delivery on time. As of April 3, the delivery account balance of this exchange was 105.5 billion yuan. The margin deposited by brokers was 52.3 billion yuan. According to regulations, 70% of the margin should be deposited with the National Bank, but this exchange deposited all of it. At that time, what was worried about was that the total transaction account balance of the brokers was estimated to be more than 2 trillion yuan. A slight mistake in the measures would inevitably lead to a financial crisis. Fortunately, the last issue was successfully delivered and concluded yesterday (9th)."</p>
<p>All measures taken by this exchange are handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. Delivery has been approved by the government from several trials to formal operation. This time, it was also urgently ordered to suspend it. Now I would like to briefly describe this exchange's feelings about the suspension of delivery:</p>
<p>(1) This government order to suspend delivery stated that after this exchange handled delivery, buyers and sellers of securities were often the same person, which could promote speculation. This statement is suspected of referring to arbitrage trading and is unfounded. Those who trust legal tender are willing to purchase spot goods and sell delivery in order to gain some slight interest. Only those who intend to invest for the long term are willing to sell spot goods and purchase delivery so that the securities will not be sold. Therefore, only those who require security and stability and those who are willing to invest funds in production are willing to buy and sell by means of arbitrage.</p>
<p>(2) Arbitrage has the effect of concentrating idle funds. Most of these idle funds come from scattered retail investors. If arbitrage is not done, they will compete to purchase daily necessities or make black market lending. Industry and commerce can use arbitrage to finance funds, but it is not believed that arbitrage funds are used for hoarding, nor is it believed that delivery leads to price increases.</p>
<p>(3) The level of interest rates depends entirely on the supply and demand of funds, and the same is true of arbitrage interest rates, and statistical arbitrage interest rates are often lower than the market's secret interest rates.</p>
<p>(4) The current phenomenon of speculation and hoarding is definitely not due to the existence of the securities market, let alone the opening of delivery. After the suspension of delivery, retail idle funds may be scattered into the path of speculation and hoarding. Because there is no adjustment of buying and selling within seven days, the responsiveness of securities prices may be even more acute.</p>

<p>Reason: Continued Decline in Overseas Oil Prices</p>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's purchases of tung oil have been relatively quiet recently. It is reported that prices in production areas have risen, and many oil merchants are unwilling to sell, holding onto their stocks to wait for higher prices. The same phenomenon is occurring in Wuzhou and Guangzhou. As of now, only 1,050 tons have been purchased. Furthermore, overseas markets have weakened, falling to around US$0.23 per pound.</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the China Trust Bureau, the government has decided to temporarily suspend exports of purchased tung oil in order to stabilize domestic and international prices and prevent the international market from falling further. Exports will resume when there is demand in the international market and prices improve. Domestically, purchases will continue so that exporters can maintain their costs. The government's implementation of the purchase policy has already had a significant effect at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e119">On Typewriters <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Zeshi</p>
<p>I once learned to type in Chinese. I learned it in three or four days, but I haven't used it in fifteen or sixteen years since I learned it. Firstly, I have no intention of being a typist, and secondly, I don't write a lot of letters or articles, so there's no need to buy a typewriter, and I can't afford it anyway.</p>
<p>But even if I could afford it, I would never buy one. To be honest, I'm against typing instead of writing. Yet there are people in the world who are so enthusiastic about typing that they think the current Chinese typewriters are not good enough and want to carefully study and improve them.</p>
<p>The purpose of changing writing to typing is often to be faster. As far as the currently popular Chinese typewriter is concerned, although some people have improved it, it is already many times faster than writing. If it is further improved, it will be even more "lightning fast." At that time, a large organization that originally needed dozens of copyists will probably only need one typist.</p>
<p>The purpose of inventing or improving tools and machines is to save manpower and time. This is a good thing. Taking the typewriter as an example, if I have to write 5,000 words a day at home, then even if I don't have to write in regular script, and I rack my brains, it will take at least five hours, and my hands will ache, my back will hurt, my appetite will be bad, and I will be constipated. If I use a typewriter, even an unimproved one, it will take at most three hours. Also, if I run a calligraphy shop or an organization whose main business is official documents and letters, before the typewriter was invented and improved, I would need ten employees. Now that I have a lightning-fast typewriter, I only need three at most. My salary expenses are greatly reduced and my income remains the same. Wouldn't that be great? So even if I have to send a respectful telegram to the person who invented or improved the typewriter, why wouldn't I want to?</p>
<p>However, if I make a living by copying official documents and letters for others, then I will not only hate the inventor or improver of the typewriter to the bone, but I will also not welcome it. Because even if I am not among those laid off, my work will definitely not decrease because of the typewriter, because the work that those who were laid off used to do will be done by me. If I am unlucky enough to be among those laid off, I will be in the pain of unemployment, and I would like to bite the inventor or improver of the typewriter three or five times.</p>
<p>Of course, since the invention of the typewriter, on the one hand, it has broken the rice bowls of many copyists. On the other hand, the manufacture and sale of typewriters requires people, which has opened a door to my profession. It is not necessarily a loss in the east and a gain in the west. But regardless of whether the loss and gain are equal, even if they are equal, I feel that there is no need to do this, adding a lot of trouble out of thin air.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that invention is something that can be done and cannot be done. There are many things that are worth inventing. For example, I often suffer from the trouble of looking up dictionaries, and I sincerely hope that someone will invent an automatic dictionary. For example, if I want to look up a certain word, I don't have to flip through it. I just need to press it on the book, and the word will come out immediately. This invention can only increase the number of people employed and will not increase the number of unemployed people, because the person who looks up the dictionary will never need a full-time specialist.</p>
<p>On the contrary, for anything related to an established "industry," it is best not to invent labor-saving tools and machines for the time being. Those who talk about material civilization and promote science must think that the above is a fallacy, but looking across the nine continents, I am confident that my humble opinion has something to offer. My humble opinion is that scientific progress and the invention of machines to save manpower are good things, but they must be done in such a way that, for example, a copyist in a certain organization originally copied ten official documents a day, taking eight hours. Now, because of the invention and improvement of the typewriter, it only takes two hours to type ten official documents a day. The six hours saved can be used to read books, chat, play chess, sleep, and become fat and healthy. Otherwise, I would rather science regress and machines not be invented. Unfortunately, the current state of the world is in "otherwise," which is sad!</p>
<h3 id="e120">A Futile Worry <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Tongtuo</p>
<p>The German astronomer Wolff of Heidelberg announced on September 11, 1909, that he had discovered a comet that, according to predicted timing, would sweep across the sky on May 18, 1910. This news did not cause surprise because, according to two thousand years of historical records, this special Halley's Comet (Holley's Comet) sweeps across the earth once every seventy-six years.</p>
<p>As early as the eighteenth century, astronomers had calculated that the comet would appear in the sky above the earth in 1910. Therefore, there was no surprise or reaction to Wolff's statement. However, some self-proclaimed clever scientists did talk about various old superstitions about comets. For example, when the comet swept across the earth in 1066, it was the time when the Normans invaded Britain. There were also several other times when Halley's Comet appeared, floods occurred, wars broke out, epidemics raged, and famines spread... Some unfortunate things always happened.</p>
<p>After Wolff discovered the comet's position, other astronomers also unanimously believed that on May 18, 1910, the comet would pass very close to the earth and would be swept by its tail. And it is said that the comet's tail contains a flammable toxic gas called cyanogen, which will harm living things on earth. So everyone felt scared. Astronomers everywhere predicted that the comet's descent would cause great disaster. To put it seriously, it could cause the end of the world.</p>
<p>As early as early April 1910, people could see the comet with the naked eye. The public felt extremely frightened. When the comet swept towards northwestern China, such as Hankou and Beiping, the peasants believed that it was a symbol of resistance to the royal family (referring to the Xinhai Revolution—translator). Bloody tragedies occurred on the streets of the city.</p>
<p>At the same time, the appearance of the comet reflected the abnormality of personal psychology. A passenger on a ship bound for Jamaica saw the comet speeding from Cuba and fell into the sea. A wealthy Hungarian landlord committed suicide because of the appearance of the comet, leaving a suicide note saying that he was afraid that the comet would cause him to die, so it would be better to commit suicide. A farmer in Alabama committed suicide by poisoning himself to avoid the comet's fierce flames.</p>
<p>Corey, chairman of the US Steel Corporation, advised friends to quickly recover their "headway" because the appearance of the comet would cause an economic collapse. On May 18, the situation became even more serious, and everyone asked the observatory how to resist the toxic flames of cyanogen. In Chicago and Berlin, women in the home used rags to block the gaps in doors and windows; a manufacturer in Manhattan built an armored small room with a hundred barrels of oxygen inside to supply the lack of air. Some people went to religion. Mexican aborigines built crosses on the tops of mountains and prayed day and night. The Soviet Union had all-night church services. Aborigines in Potorico lit candles and marched, leading to the desolation of the morning forest. Many people in the United States also wasted time and lost their jobs, sitting and waiting for chaos. Miners in the Colorado silver mine hid at the bottom of the mine and waited for the comet to pass. Work in the cotton and tobacco fields in the south was suspended because blacks had to pray for God's salvation.</p>
<p>Then, the great May 18, 1910, came. There was no movement during the day. It is said that the most terrifying thing was at night. Some people wanted to celebrate their last night on earth, so they held a "Comet Cocktail Party." Some held "Comet Dance Parties" in rooftop gardens or parks, but the night passed and there were no anomalies. Only a French observatory saw a little phosphorescence in the sky, and the compass on the route was slightly affected by radio waves. That's all. No toxic gas, no chaos, and no end of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Also Talk About Names <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yuan</p>
<p>Chen Zuogao's article "Idle Talk About Names" in this column on March 25 traces the source and explores the distance, and the content is described in great detail; however, the citations of ancient people's names seem to be still less searched and recorded, so I will not hesitate to use words and restate what I know.</p>
<p>In the past, there were many people with the same name and style name (字), which is often seen in historical records, especially in the Tang Dynasty; for example, Guo Ziyi and his sons all had the same name and style name. The recently unearthed Wang Zhongkan base record (stone is now in Chongxiao Temple, Beiping) also has the sentence "Your name is Zhongkan, style name is Zhongkan." There are also those who use three characters as the style name, such as Zhang Tianxi of the former Liang Dynasty, whose style name was Gong Chungha. Qu Tu Wuwei, a Taoist in the Sui Dynasty, whose style name was Wu Buwei. Chao Yidao of the Song Dynasty, whose style name was Shuo Zhi, and his other style name was Boyifu. And Ouyang Wenzhong Gong's epitaph of Liu Yuanfu's tomb records the Liu brothers saying: "Chang's style name is Bo Gongfu, Ban's style name is Zhong Yuanfu." Until the end of the Ming Dynasty, the remnant old Chuan Shan, whose style name was Qingzhu, and another style name was Gong Zhituo. Wen Ruizuan, whose style name was Tian Nai Xue. Tao Yi, whose style name was Zhao Wanyou. Liang Liu, whose style name was Yuan Zhi Shen. Zhang Geng, who wrote the Painting and Calligraphy Records, whose style name was Gong Zhi Yu. And in the Tang Dynasty, women mostly used three characters as the style name. Yang Jun's wife, Wei's inscription: "The wife's name is Tan Te, style name is Kun Ye Li." Cui's tomb record of Mrs. Lu Gong: "The wife's name is Ji, title is Zun Dexing." The epitaph of the Upasaka Wei Zengyou: "The Upasaka's name is Wei Zengyou." The tomb record of the Bhikkhuni Fayan: "Fayan's style name is Wu Suode." The tomb record of Mrs. Fan: "Surname Fan, name is Ru Lianhua." There are many others, and I cannot record them all, but they are not commonly seen after the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>It is quite rare for the surname and name to be the same. Xin Jiaxuan had two concubines, one named Tiantian and the other named Qianqian. In the Ming Dynasty, there was Shen Shen who wrote four volumes of Wine History. In Qing Shanyin, there was a staff member named Sun Sun. In modern times, there is Ye Ye (namely Mr. Ye Chucang), an important person in the Party and State. And it is said that in Hunan during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, there was a scholar named Le Le Le, which takes the meaning of the benevolent love the mountains and the wise love the waters. The three characters are read three times, like Yue Xiao Luo in the past, which is incredible and can also be regarded as a new and strange facet in the history of names.</p>
<p>Moreover, the combination of surnames and names is also widely heard, such as the ancient people Tian Yannian, Qian Yannian, Wang Xiangniang, Zhang Wanggang, Chen Xunren, and Tian Juanjuan, Lu Fufu, whose surnames and names are in the same rhyme. Such as Luo Yi Qing, Miao Boran, Li Wuyan, Qian Wanxuan, Ming Jiu Han, Wang Zuo Cai, Wanxiang Chun, Shi Yu Hua, Cheng Jiuwan, Fu Hao Li, Mi Wanzhong, whose surnames and names are connected with meaning. Those who use numbers have sixty-seven, seventy-one, seventy-five, eighty-six, and ninety. Those who use stems and branches have Shen Hai, Ding Bing, Yin Wu Chen, and Ding Shen. Those who resemble women include Feng Fu, Cui Yuanyang, Xu Furen, and Ding Furen. Those with the same rhyme category include Song Youyuan, Ruan Xian, Tan Yuanxian, Qi Tai, Ruan Yuan, Ma Xitai, and Xiao Jing. And Wu Dayou, whose style name is Youda, Mao Qizong, whose style name is Zongqi, whose reversed name is the style name, is even more interesting. As for the Qing Gong Gongxiang (Xiaoqi), he said Taixi, Wu Wu, Cheng, Xiaoding, Jiang Shangyiye, Shua Ci, Changpao, Yin Jiu Shi Rou Mian Hua Seng... and so on, reaching several dozen, which is really not as good as Shitao monk who has specialized in it before. (Editor's note: When I was studying in middle school, I met a classmate whose surname was "Liu." According to him, his surname must be written in lowercase "Da," not in uppercase "Lu.")</p>

<p>Recently, Shanghai has been conscripting young men, and the selection has been completed. Huangpu District has announced the list of those selected. Military service is an obligation that citizens should fulfill. However, life in the Chinese army is really too poor.

<p>— Nianhong</p>
<p>It is said that true beauty is natural and does not require decoration. However, in fact, there are still many people, things, and objects that are decorated, precisely because these people, things, and objects were not very beautiful in the first place, so they had to borrow artificial means.</p>
<p>In fact, there is nothing wrong with a neat appearance and polite attitude, but it should not be too contrived. It is even more unacceptable to forget to improve the internal goods while only focusing on decorating the facade. It is necessary to talk about efficiency in doing things, but it is not possible to only engage in superficial and impractical work in order to strengthen efficiency, because being strong on the outside but weak on the inside cannot help the facts. On the contrary, it will only become an obstacle to improving efficiency.</p>
<p>Take the postal service, which is praised as the most successful of the various state-owned enterprises, for example. Recently, there seem to be many new achievements and improvements, such as rush-hour mailboxes, mobile post offices, post kiosks, and district delivery. Among them, some can indeed benefit the public, but some do not have much use, such as mobile post offices. In fact, very few people who actually mail letters accurately calculate the time to wait for the bus; the same is true for post kiosks. Every time I walk past the post kiosk on Baxian Bridge, I think of Jinling Middle Road. It seems superfluous to build another post kiosk here. Recently, I heard that there are also glass mailboxes appearing, and I don't think it makes much sense. It would be better to save this money to increase the salaries of hardworking postal workers, or to set up more village agencies to be more practical and beneficial.</p>
<p>The reason why the post office is used as an example here is because the current post office is better than most institutions in adopting public opinion, but in essence, there are still many places that need to be improved in the post office. Recently, postal rates have increased. The increase can be forgiven, but if the increased money is spent on decorating the surface work, I say it cannot be forgiven.</p>
<p>However, the example of the post office is a small one. In the entire China, whether it is a government agency, a private company, or all administration, it only focuses on the surface. What the authorities require of administrative personnel is only a clean and efficient surface. I remember a foreign reporter said that Chinese politicians are mostly plasterers by origin, because what they do is just layer after layer of brushing white powder on the wall, as long as it looks snowy white and shiny, as for the foundation of the wall, they usually don't ask questions. Although this is close to joking, it is a fact. Do we want to remain silent and ashamed?</p>

<p>Plants are green once a year, animals are green once in a lifetime, especially</p>
<p>When children write essays, the opening is either "Time is like water" or "Life in the world"—"Time is like water" is "worldliness," "life in the world" is "human nature";—children are small but not small-minded, and villains also like to talk big.</p>
<p>One move in chess can determine the whole game.</p>
<p>One thought can determine a person's life.</p>
<p>Immortals in paradise want to think about the mortal world, and demons in hell want to be reborn. It's not just people who are dissatisfied with reality.</p>
<p>Birth, old age, sickness, death, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are two equations—a system of life equations</p>
<p>Such fragrant and rich wine will also go bad; how many days can people's happy times last?</p>

<p>— Dansun</p>
<p>A naturalist wanted to study the question of "Are ants really talented?" so he paid attention to the ants' actions. One day, on a power line between a stone wall and an apple tree, there were four or five ants running back and forth on the line. So the scholar wrapped adhesive paper around a section of the power line near the wall, so that the ants could not pass freely. Two days later, when the scholar observed again, in addition to one ant being stuck on the paper because it was careless, he also saw that many tender leaves of the apple tree had already been laid on the adhesive paper, and many ants were walking safely across the bridge made of leaves.</p>

<p>According to legend, in the Huainan area, there is a kind of fish called "Lazy Woman Fish," which is said to be the daughter-in-law of the Yang family, who was not diligent in her duties and was drowned by her mother-in-law and turned into fish. The fish's fat can be used for lighting candles, but when used to illuminate the qin and play chess, it shines brightly, and when used to illuminate spinning, it is no longer bright. It can be said that it does not understand its degree until death, and it is really too lazy to thoroughly understand it.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was invited by Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director Zhao Zukang, etc., and hurried to the old Mitsui Garden to appreciate cherry blossoms. I spontaneously composed three quatrains as follows:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The spring breeze and fragrant trees sing new orioles, the flowers bloom in the second month of Jiangnan, thousands of purples and reds, the chickens are provincial knowledge, the clear scarlet is only limited to brightness.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The lush cherry blossoms are free from the dust of weaving, the pavilions and buildings are embellished with newness everywhere, it is like living in Xinghua Village, the warm fragrance and sunny flowers can't win the spring.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The best products from Japan are piled up like brocade, the broken rivers and mountains return to spring again, after listening to a song across the river, Chongqing's business has more sorrow on this day.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Forgetful Edison <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>The scientist with the worst memory is the inventor of the light bulb, Edison. Especially in this great man's childhood, he was famous for being forgetful: in school, he would completely forget what he had learned. His grades were the worst in the whole grade, and even the teachers could only sigh helplessly—no one complained that he was stupid and clumsy. Some doctors, after examining his brain and finding it had a special abnormality, dared to predict dogmatically that he would definitely die of brain disease.</p>
<p>What was the extent of Edison's forgetfulness? A very small fact can explain it: it is said that once when he was using all his brainpower to think about a major scientific problem, his feet walked to the tax office. There were many taxpayers, arranged like a long snake, paying in turn to the authorities. When it was Edison's turn, he couldn't say his name for a while. Although he tried hard to think about it for a while, he had forgotten it completely; as a result, his neighbor told him that he knew his name was Thomas Edison. This joke was immediately spread out, and it has not been forgotten until now.</p>
<p>Edison's spirit of hard work is amazing enough. He often buries himself in the laboratory all day and all night to do research. One morning, when the servant brought breakfast, he was dozing off, and the servant did not dare to disturb him. But at this time, his assistants had already finished breakfast, taking advantage of the moment of leisure, and intended to tease him once—a full plate of eggs and ham and a full cup of coffee had been replaced with empty plates and empty cups in front of Edison. When he woke up, saw these empty plates, drank the cup of coffee, and the bread crumbs all over the table, he suspiciously rubbed his eyes, thought about it, and thought he had indeed had breakfast. So, as usual, he started working after smoking a cigarette. It was not until his assistants laughed beside him that he knew he had been tricked.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Leisurely Flowers <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Leisurely at Sea (123)</p>
<p>Reaching the doorway, a thought suddenly struck his heart: What would he say to his father upon this sudden return? To reveal his distress, the old man might not understand. Yet, to remain silent would feel like a suppression of pent-up sorrow, a need for catharsis. For an individual, poverty often leads to thoughts of returning home. Today, Zhuzhai found himself in such a state. His heart ached, compelling him to return and confide in his parents. Thus, he had summoned a carriage, only to feel a sense of shame upon arriving at his doorstep, hesitant to proceed. Eventually, he resolved that regardless of his father's scolding or resentment, he must see him and pour out his heart, seeking solace. Pushing open the front door, he proceeded straight to the inner courtyard. Lifting the door curtain, he saw his father, Yuru, and his mother conversing inside. Seeing Zhuzhai enter, Yuru inquired, "Do you have time to return today?" Zhuzhai felt a pang of sorrow at his father's question. His mother added, "Zhuzhai, you look unwell. What troubles you?" This further deepened Zhuzhai's distress, rendering him speechless. He sat on a chair, tears streaming down his face. His mother exclaimed in alarm, "Zhuzhai, what's the matter?" Unable to articulate his feelings, Zhuzhai merely dabbed at his tears with a handkerchief. A period of silence ensued, broken by Yuru's sigh. "No need to explain your affairs. I am more or less aware of everything. I know all about your escapades. Regarding your situation, I visited Qihuan's home. Qihuan is intelligent and understanding of my intentions. To preserve our family's reputation and safeguard your honor, she is willing to sacrifice her own views, endure hardship, and bear the brunt of criticism, all to give you a jolt and sever your infatuation. I admire this girl greatly. Perhaps now, you harbor resentment towards her seeming heartlessness. However, all her actions were to fulfill her promise. She deliberately engaged in behaviors she disliked, creating a negative impression to dissuade you from longing for her. Only I am aware of her efforts. Yesterday, I heard from Uncle Xiao Bai that she has returned to the stage in Shanghai and has a promising future. You need not worry about her any longer. From now on, you must tread the righteous path and strive for success." Hearing Yuru's words, Zhuzhai felt as if the old man had spoken everything he wanted to say. He replied, "I understand Qihuan's sacrifices and feel sorry for her. I know my past actions were wrong. I wish to return home, but my daughter-in-law is very displeased with me and will not allow my return, which makes me very distressed."</p>
