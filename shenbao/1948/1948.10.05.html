<h3 id="c22">社論　搶購、游資、與生產 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>近來市塲上，發生一種搶購的現象，最初發現於成都，其後復續見於渝昆等地；這都有特殊的原因，卽所謂鎳幣風潮，茲姑不論。</p>
<p>但本市的搶購現象，並無特殊的事故可言，徒以（一）執行限價，較他處較為切實之故，一般觀感，成認為物價便宜，落得乘機多買些，以免坐失機會，，（二）因為少數特殊商品如肉蛋等蔬菜，貝尼西林等西藥，供給偶見短絀，便聯想到其餘物品，以為或將發生同樣情形了：（三）自幣制改革以來，本市物價，大體極為平穩，當局並曾一再宣佈，所有「八·一九」的限價，除若干與外滙及增稅有關商品，准予合理調整外，其餘一概維持原盤，絕不予以變更，而一部份人看漲的心理，仍舊沒有澈底掃除：（四）黃牛黨推波助瀾，浩成了一種搶購的風　：（五）游資充斥，無處宣洩，而生產事業雖在當局宣稱維護之聲浪中，還是束縛過甚，不能吸引游資，使民間零星的剩餘購買力，不期而羣向物資進攻。以上各種因素，除游資充斥一點，業經各方面同聲呼籲，確乎尙待趕緊設法改進外，其餘一，二，三各點，事實上缺乏根據，實不能不說是心理上的錯覺所造成。</p>
<p>這理由是十分明顯的。關於限價的衝破，在商民狃於積習，雖或有一部份迄今尙不肯放棄這種期待，然而當局態度堅定，絲毫沒有放鬆，我們實在沒有跡家可以相信，現在那種便宜貨，卽將有稍縱卽逝，無可再搨的一天。何况經濟管制的施行，不但日益加强，而且益趨於全面化，例如華中經濟督導員的增設，和上海區的範圍擴充到三省兩市。這種措施，顯在加强管制，使各地物價均能向上海看齊，而不是放鬆上海，讓它向各地看齊。所以今後的物價，除與外滙及增稅有關之商品外，確沒有普徧看漲的可能。</p>
<p>至於供絡方面，以物資外流，尙在嚴密管制之中，本市的生產成品，實際只有過剩，斷不會感到缺乏，市面亦不虞波動。因為上海是我國進口的第一商港，也是全國工業的主要重心，這些進口貨和製成品，在平時都要四通八達，供應到全國的每一角落裏的，除絕少數商品，具有特殊原因外，其存儲數量，至少還可以支持到好幾個月。何况在物資出境仍須獲得許可，還沒有恢復常態以前，以這些存儲的物資，僅僅對於本市五百萬人口的供給，何至於發生問題？而且開放自備外滙，疏通工廠原料，近來當局亦正在積極設法之中，一面擴充配給，同時與其他各地區準備辦理易貨，似此產銷兩方面雙管齊下，標本兼施，則上海一埠，依然是全國經濟的重心，其就地銷售的各種貨物，不過佔到它的一小部份，尤無短少缺乏之可慮。</p>
<p>所眞正可慮的，還是游資如何消納問題·目前政府所已實行的對策，如國營事業股票的出售，短期金圓庫券的推銷，敵偽產業與剩餘物資的淸理，商業行莊的限期增資等，均在着着進行之中。但據發行準備監理委員會的報吿，截至九月三十日止，全國金圓券的發行總額，已到九億五千餘萬元，幾達法定發行額的半數，而流通在外未及收回的法幣和東北流通券，尙不在內。這個鉅額的通貨數量，如果不進一步，想一個迅速回籠的辦法，則其威脅物價，和引誘投機囤積的潛在力，確乎不可忽視的！當局在此種情况下，若還熟視無覩，以為搶購商品都只是市民心理作祟，而不從鼓勵游資用於生產之道想法，其後果是可慮的！然則如何使大量游資迅速回籠？如何使游資轉而用之於增加生產？我們以為：</p>
<p>第一，最簡單的方法，無過於恢復同業定存，使它重回到央行的庫裏去。這原是幣制改革以前的老辦法，也是手續上最便利的辦法。只須所定利率，相當合理，使商業行莊不至於明賠暗虧，則其吸收游資的力量，恐怕要比任何其他辦法為有效。所成為問題的，就是央行對於這筆存款如果與其他行莊一樣，無法可以運用，便不免要蝕耗利息。然而為整個的經濟局面看想，國家這筆小小的蝕耗，似乎並非毫無意義。况且中央銀行是銀行之銀行，本有調劑金融控制通貨之戰責，在這頭寸過於鬆濫而無法卽予消納的時候，似不便束手無策，毫不舉動吧！</p>
<p>其次，根本問題還是要從鼓勵生產入手。中央銀行吸收游資以後，應卽嚴密考核，祗須眞正新辦生產事業，或擴充生產設備，或運購生產原料，就可予以貸款，或用定貨方式貸以流動資金，使社會多數游資能透過金融業尤其中央銀行之門，而投用於生產事業，則一方面資金有正當用途，一方面物資可以增加，當能消滅目前「不事生產，專搶物資」的怪現象。</p>
<p>最後，我們願再率直地提醒政府和人民最緊要的兩點：就是：（一）天下只有限制消費，而决沒有限制生產的。假使當局的用意本在限制消費，而他方面的舉措有使從事於生產事業者裹足不前之可能，或正當的工商者竟也有了一糧深恐動輙得咎的錯覺，而羣趨於緊縮消極之一途，則存儲物資縱然甚多，難免有坐吃山空的一天。故政府應立卽用種種事實，表示扶助生產事業之决心，而不使正當工商者有所疑慮。（二）金圓政策。只許成功，不許失敗的。善良守法的人民旣繳出他們的金銀外幣，申報他們的外滙資產，掉換了金圓，政府　一方面有保障他們財產與維持金圓價值的責任　另一方而更有使豪門巨室也同樣守法繳兌擁護國策的義務，而後更可以獲得一般人民之完全信賴。同時，人民也應該信任政府，一變其往日重物輕幣的心理，看重自己手裏的金圓券，珍重使用。須知此次金圓政策巳使人民與政府在經濟上眞正做到同船共命的地步了，人民如果還只知搶購物資，而不投資於生產以增加物資，則物咨搶購完了的一天，也就是國民經濟總崩潰的一天！</p>

<p>〔本報南京四日電〕中大匪諜學生朱成學·華彬淸·李飛及共匪南京城工部交通組組員陶元貴·唐世貴被首都特刑庭分別判處有期徒刑六年·五年·十年後，均感量刑過重，請求中央特刑庭覆判，惟原起訴檢察官顧如綸認為原判決對事實認定及適用法條均有失當之處，亦聲請覆判。其聲請覆判理由書指被吿朱成學·華彬淸·李飛當肄業國立中央大學時，卽思想左傾，經常與民盟首腦部聯絡，接受奸匪指使，從事叛亂工作，指導中大左傾壁報，時作反動宣傳，並策動學潮，領導罷課等事實，乃係經首都衛戍總司令部·憲兵司令部·中統局分別調查為實，各有送案之調查書附卷鑒證，詎原判決謂經審判核尙乏積極佐證以資徵實，應免置議云云，但查首都衛戍總司令部，憲兵司令部均有協助司法機關價查犯罪之職責，此為現行刑事訴訟法及調度司法警察條例所明定，則其調查書應係調查之事實，當未發現確切之佐證足證其調查確非眞實時，自不能憑一己主觀之意思，卽認為不實。原判決對上開三機關之調查雖有不能採信之表示，但又未能釋明不一應採信之理由，此太檢察官對原一判認定事實不能認為適當者一也。再查被吿陶元貴·唐世貴充任奸匪南京城工作交通組組員，經常為奸匪實施交通工作，至被吿朱成學·華彬淸·李飛受奸匪指使，屢次策動學潮，宣傳赤化，領導暴動，則上開被吿等均已甘心參加奸匪組織，接受其命令，在大後方首都所在地，實施各種叛亂行為，以遂奸匪開闢第二戰棧之計劃，俾與前方奸匪暴動相呼應，竭力充實其叛亂基礎，而盡分工合作之效，以達顛覆政府之目的，是被吿等應負分担叛亂犯罪之罪責，有何疑義？詎原判決書起訴法條上未論處此，本檢察官認為原判適用法條尙欠當者二也。綜上二點理由，爰依特種刑庭審判條例第二條，特種刑事案件訴訟條例第十條聲請覆判，擬請撤銷原判，另為適當之判決，期無妄縱，藉收戡亂建國之效。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕國防部何部長，四日下午在招待合灣慰勞團席上致詞稱：</p>
<p>諸位從台灣遠道來京，不久卽將轉赴各地，慰勞戡亂剿匪的將士，把台灣同胞對於戡亂將士的關切和熱忱，傳達給全軍官兵，這實在足以振奮軍心，發揚士氣，使全軍官兵都知道在他們的後面，有無數同胞正在支持他們，期望他們早日完成戡亂的任務，達到建國的目的。尤其因為台灣同胞遠處海外，本身並不受到匪患的威脅，而同樣關心前方的官兵，給他們熱烈的慰勞，所以這種熱情，這種關切，更顯得特別珍貴，特別令人感激。</p>
<p>各位先生，當然早已明瞭當前共匪的全面叛亂，是我們建國的最後陣碍，我們必須排除萬難，戡平匪患，國家纔可以建漸步入富强康樂之境，全國人民纔可以享受和平安樂的生活。國家是整個的，不可分的，全國同胞無分地域省區，在國家的大範圍以內，正和一個大家庭一樣，所有禍福·休　·利書·榮辱，都是相關的，共同的，從前昏庸腐肢的滿淸政府，不明這個道理，將台灣同胞遺棄，任其受日本帝國主義的宰割，殊不知台灣正是整個中國的一部份，是和整個中國的命運不可分割的，所以自從甲午直到抗戰勝利，合灣同胞固然受到日本帝國主義的蹂躪，整個中國也同樣受到日本帝國主義的欺凌，等到對日抗戰勝利以後，日本投降，整個國家的外患得以消除，台灣的同胞也實現了自由解放，重返祖國懷抱的願望。目前共匪全面叛亂，使國家不能從事建設，許多省區的同胞都不能安居樂業，流難失所，台灣的同胞雖然沒有身受這種痛苦，但是從各位先生代表全體合胞不辭意道而來，我們就可以證明，台灣的同胞們對於戡平匪患，同鐵具有無限的熱忱，並不因為本省的安定，就忘懷了整個國家所遭受的困難。從這一事實，就可以證明戡亂剿匪，是我們全國人民一致的要求，我們深信在舉國一致的努力之下，是沒有不可以戡平的禍亂的</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，應欽曾親到台灣各重要城鎭，處理接受日軍投降事宜，親見台胞教育營及，工業發達，生活勤儉刻苦，社會秩序，良好安定，對於國家忠誠熱愛，對於建設事業積極推行，感到無限欣慰，認為台灣就是我們建國的模範，是國家復興的基地之一，今天能有這樣一個機會，復和各位先生共聚一堂，代表全國官員接受全體台胞對於戡亂將士的慰勞，自然尤其感覺興奮。為了使台灣的建設能够在全國發生示範的作用，台灣同胞的努力，能够在建國的途中結出更美滿的成果，我敢保證全體將士，一定會更加奮勉，以報答台灣同胞和各位先生的慰勞，以完成我們軍人所負的戡亂建國的使命。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：聯合國安理會四日下午三時十二分於緊張空氣中宣佈開會，討論西方列强控訴蘇聯因封鎖柏林而威脅世界和平一案。會議開始後，美代表奧斯汀　聲明美國為爭議之一方，對此案討論，應迥避主席地位，按照向例，主席應讓與阿根廷担任。惟因阿外長勃拉馬格里亞現在本國，一般暗示阿根廷亦必將主席讓與他國代表祖任·在辯論之初，蘇代表維辛斯基指出安理會無權干預東西兩方之爭執。幷謂蘇聯對於西方列强之控訴認為毫無根據，且超出安理會之權力範圍，故不應在安理會中討論。但美代表冷然答稱，無論如何，西方列强對其控訴決將堅持到底，並正式拒絕蘇方建議召開四强外長會議討論柏林問題之最近照會。笑代表謂「蘇聯現仍拒絕解除柏林封鎖，仍是威脅世界和平。」</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎四日廣播：維辛斯基在安理會中稱：聯合國討論柏林問題，違波茨坦協定，蘇聯「不願為此種違背行為之一方。一維氏稱，「吾人反對將此案列入議程，並堅持此議程不應通過。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎四日電〕英美法三國四日決議拒絕蘇聯召集新外長會議之建義，除非柏淋封鎖能無條件解除。西方三國代表之發言人宣布西方之立塲如次：「決不談判，直至封鎖解除為止，封鎖厥為一切之主題。」蘇聯於四日上午由莫斯科電台廣播其建議，午刻前再正式提交西方總部，以避免安理會下午三時開會時辯論柏林問題，西方乃宣佈立塲以資答覆。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎四日電〕蘇聯今日要求西方三國將整個德國問題交還外長會議，以避免安理會辯論柏林事件。在安理會定今廿下午三時集會商討前數小時，莫斯科電合突席播蘇方對西方九月廿六日照會之答覆，而提出前項建議。按西方照會通知蘇政府以三國決定放棄談判而提請安理會仲裁，蘇聯覆文則堅稱，莫斯科談判決定以訓令致四國駐德軍事總督，故封鎖一節已吿解決。又稱，西方三國應遵從莫斯科決議，而不應妄加運用，致危及德境蘇佔區之蘇方權利。</p>
<p>莫斯科稱，蘇聯要求承認東德馬克為柏林唯一通貨，然此僅為解除封鎖條件之一，然西方國家橫施阻撓，要求四强控制蘇馬克之發行，此舉顯然危害蘇區內之蘇聯權利。蘇聯覆文可望形成蘇代表在安理會內力爭取消議程上柏林問題時之一般情調。蘇覆文辯稱，西方佔區改革幣制，蘇區勢將受其累，蘇聯乃不得已封鎖柏林以資保護，蘇聯又稱，西區改幣僅係西方違反統一德國之波茨坦協定，企圖成立獨立之西德許多方法中之一種。蘇覆文又稱，「柏林問題，與整個德國問題·及西德單獨政府之成立，三者有密切關係。根據聯合國憲章第一〇七款，該事應由負責佔領德國諸國家處理，而不屬於安理會管轄。」蘇照會在結尾要求召集外長會議，「根據波茨坦四强協定」，考慮柏林及整個德國問題。蘇覆文承認柏林蘇司令曾要求管轄西方之空運，為防止東西區黑市金錢交易，此舉乃不得不然者。「由於英美法三國政府拒絕實踐訓令，故雖所餘異見不甚重要，談判卒吿失敗。」照會又稱，西方要求干涉蘇聯之印鈔數字而擬「最後將蘇聯逐出」德境蘇佔區。</p>

<p>渠指斥美官員包括杜魯門在內之心口不一，美代表奧斯汀在安理會內慷慨陳詞，在原子能方面有寬大之施予時，杜魯門及軍事領袖則發表相反之言論。曼氏稱，美國要求他國在原子能方面犧牲主權，而本身則不肯放棄一絲一毫主權，「此乃狹窄之自私心理，而出之以美國計劃之名。如他國以牙還牙，提出計劃，使美國放棄主權，則美國又將有何說？」曼氏嚴斥西方「對蘇聯不了解，亦不求了解」，白俄流亡者及希魔盟友之「垃圾箱」內搜集消息。渠間接指控西方駐蘇武官負責間諜行動，而又稱西方欲明蘇聯內情，應垂詢「有時携帶攝影機參觀吾人設備之西方武官」。渠宣佈美國管制原子之計劃，「在根本上卽不能接受」。又指斥美建議旨在贏取聯大之壓倒支撑，俾美國能專心製造原子彈及肆無忌憚準備新戰爭、瑞典代表桑特婁宣稱，蘇聯之原子管制計劃，不能令人滿意，然仍籲請大國繼續談判。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎四日電〕法國三十萬煤礦工人自今晨起開始總能工，抗議居伊政府之裁員依命令，惟迄今為止，尚無意外之事發生，預料有若干錫礦工人亦將加入罷工。又在此次罷工中，共黨所領導之總工會與基督敎工會，態度頗為不同，共黨總工會主張無限期罷工，而基督敎工會則主張四十八小時罷工，並企圖與經濟部長拉柯斯還不錯得協議。如再發生長期罷工，則法國全部經濟活動必將總於癱瘓。按法國之煤礦乃國營者，居伊總理已決定裁減政府屬下之工人，作為經濟計劃之一部分。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕競購之風昨仍未稍殺，社會局長吳開先昨晨往訪經管督導員蔣經國，商洽應付方策，晤談甚久。據吳局長談：決定推行主要物品定期定量限購政策，以作物品配給制度尙未普遍實施前之臨時辦法。凡市民購買主要物品，槪須以國民身份證為憑，除毛絨綫已實行憑證限購粗絨一磅半細絨一磅外，呢絨及布疋每人一律限購一丈五尺，呢絨每年限購一次，布疋每三月限購一次，均以憑本市國民身份證為限。購後於國民身份證背後蓋章，以防再購。社會局已分令該業公會知照，卽日起實施。綢緞料最近亦擬限制購買，每人限購一件。將來襯衫，汗衫，襪子等日用品，均凖備限制購買，以杜絕搶購現象。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市小菜塲方面，豬肉近因到埠豬船增多，各零售店供應數量已較前略增，惟仍供不應求。現京滬綫各城市及本市附近鄉區，因得悉本市肉荒情形，多紛紛設法將豬肉偷運來滬，大部份用黑市價格售予各酒菜館，據聞此種豬肉中確有「病豬」·「死豬」·「瘟豬」·之肉夾雜在內，惟據衛生局表示，鄕民運肉來滬圖利，多化整為零，根本係偷運性質，渠等百般逃避檢査人員耳貝，至市區後又皆直接與酒菜館交易，故各酒菜館出售之肉類是否完全淸潔，事實上頗難一一加以檢驗。今後唯有一方面敦促酒菜館及市民切實注意，勿再貪小失大，購食未經檢驗之肉類，同時該局當訂定辦法，加强檢査，以期在此肉荒聲中，確實保障市民健康。</p>
<p>蔬菜多次貨鷄胃有水泥</p>
<p>普通蔬菜供應情形仍與往日無異，惟限價菜已盡為次劣之貨，且常摻水尅扣斤兩，市民為求購得較佳蔬菜，在不得已之情形下，亦已習於以黑市論價，故各菜塲之限價牌示已等於具文。至鷄類前曾一時絕跡，近一部份菜塲忽出現大批鷄隻，市民初均聞風搶購，詎購歸宰殺後，竟於鷄胃內發現重達斤餘之水泥，且已殭硬成塊，據聞此種新法尙發明不久，其根本原因由於鷄販格於限價，異想天開，遂在出售前一二小時，將水泥粉和水混調麩皮，搓成細條，用强塞入鷄頭，以圖增加重量，此種鷄於吞食水泥粉後一二小時卽死，惟市民在秤購時多無法察覺。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據關係方面透露：自幣制改革以來，經濟與金融情形，已逐步走上正軌。例如八月十九日本市之商業行莊存款總數，約折合六百萬金圓券，而九月底之存款總値，已達二億四千萬金圓之鉅，其增加之速度至為可驚。收兌金銀外幣固使金圓券之發行增加，但另一方面，政府仍致力於通貨之收縮。如國營事業股票發行以來，已銷售近五百萬金圓，拋售物資及短期金圓庫券之發行，亦已收回相等於一千萬美金之通貨，兩者合計，為數可觀。同時政府為加强緊縮頭寸起見，將來可實行股票做抵押及定貨存款等辦法。故通貨發行雖逾九億金圓，但在市面之游資並不如想像之多。</p>
<p>主要物資無虞匱乏</p>
<p>至於工業原料及日用必需品之存量，尤為豐富，兩日來市面之競購現象，實全出於心理之錯覺。以原棉而論，美棉已可滿足百分之六十之需要，其餘百分之四十如運輸無問題，亦有把握取得。央行最近並擬採購國棉二百五十萬担，故本市原棉之供應無缺。關於麵粉部份，決向美國購運麥籽，不運成品，使上海之粉廠能充分開工。據主管機關統計：勝利之初，棉布存量僅有二百萬疋，目前已增至六百五十萬疋，可供本市半年之用。棉紗現存量為十萬包，過去每個月消費四萬包，上月僅消費一萬包，折衷計算，至少可維持三個月。食油之存量亦至豐富，食糖現存八萬噸，而全國消費量不過一萬噸而已。</p>
<p>米煤供應前途樂觀</p>
<p>地食米之供應，美米及台灣米已佔全部需求量之百分之四十二，餘數則可向附近產地購買。截至目前之統計，本市米店之存米量為二十七萬祖，民間尙有儲藏，惟以分散之故，難於統計，將來上海可以過剩之物資運出，以易取外埠各地之糧食。以動力來源之煤斤而論，情勢亦甚樂觀，萍株路接軌後，萍鄉煤可與台灣煤開濼煤同樣大量供應，故本市決無煤荒之虞。綜言之，無論自金融或物資觀點言，上海之經管前途均甚光明，深望市民能堅定自信，免生無謂之驚擾云。</p>

<p>上海區、經濟管制督導員蔣經國，昨召集戡建大隊及靑年服務隊幹部訓話，勗勉要有高度的政治認識與組織觀念。渠列舉統計數字，指出一月半來，上海市塲已有了質的轉變，卽在「八一九」之前，上海各商業銀行之存款，總計六百五十萬金圓，而上週存款總數，則過二億一千二百萬金圓，此項資金，過去卽用於投機市塲，興風作浪者。投機市塲之消滅，表示市塲之本質，已有變化。然除消滅投機外，尤應積極增加生產。渠引本市最大之棉紗，捲菸兩業為例，說明此二業雖非機械工業，ｑｄ在上海工業部門中，量具基礎與規模，為了維持工人的生活，與市面的安定，政府已設法加以維護，原料之供給，絕無問題。</p>
<p>魚市塲亦將被取消</p>
<p>至此，渠以極爽朗之口吻，指示今日我們所追求之目的，乃一富有壓史意義之社會革命，其基本要求，首須一反以前窮人越窮，富人越富的現象，必使窮人獲得生活，第二要消滅不勞而獲的中間剝削渚，第三要使生產者獲得生活的保障，在解釋此三項目標中，渠以堅決之語氣，表示政府繼取消紗布市塲以後，將繼續取消魚市塲，務使生產者與消費者日益接近，而避免中間商之重重剝削，及乘機興風作浪，投機操縱，為害民生。渠又認為此項行動乃革命性之工作，勉勵同志必須自身具有高度之政治素養與組織觀念，方能堅定不移，加以貫澈。對於本市近日來所發生之搶購風氣，渠認為此係終日好閒之徒，不健全之心理所造成，並謂捲烟加稅後，政府每月可增入三千四百萬金圓稅收。</p>
<p>民生用品不虞缺乏</p>
<p>至於民生日用必需之米·油·糖·煤等物品，則一律照舊，且其存量充足，油可供給四月，糖存八萬噸，足供八月之用，布存六二〇萬疋，足供全國半年，紗存九萬件，亦無匱乏之虞。而目前若干人之所以終日惶惶者，乃因其平日缺乏戰鬥之訓練與經騐，過慣了安逸之生活，以致一遇變動，遂卽驚惶無指，然按諸實際，誠無恐慌之理由。渠又透露本市公務人員及工人，決自十一月一日起配售鹽·油·米·煤·糖·布，其準備工作可於月內完成，俾生產者獲得生活之保障。最後，渠警惕同志謂，今日吾人尙未遇到敵人眞正之主力，必須戰戰兢兢，乃可完成神聖之使命，渠對靑年服務總隊，寄予極熱烈之期望，並謂必從政治訓練開始，使之明瞭革命目的，成為領袖忠實之信徒，以從事社會革新之工作。</p>

<p>並未代購代件</p>
<p>金潤聲目應庭詢供稱：渠未任警備司令部任何職務，亦非該部第六稽査大隊隊員，惟與該部若干人員素有來往，與戚再玉夫人，前在戰時相識，故有時與戚家來往。去冬某日，有吳寳康之親戚丁某，到家數度訪渠，稱吳為警備部人員捕去，託渠探詢被捕原因，後渠卽詢知吳寳康被人檢舉於戰時曾有搜購電話機資敵行為。旋由渠及第六稽査大隊出納薛建樹將吳保釋後，由丁某及吳之賬房陸儒卿同到渠家，贈市銀行兩千萬元支票一張，表示對渠之謝意，庭上繼詢保釋吳之條件如何？金稱：先由丁某與戚直接洽談，最後決定繳款四億五千五百萬元，並非由渠從中講妥。</p>
<p>代借桌櫈等物</p>
<p>次由第一一被吿郁舜華供稱：未在第六稽査大隊擔任職務，因警備部舉行追悼戴先生（按係指戴笠）逝世紀念會，由渠代借桌櫈及為該隊購買柴火，前往該隊時，在門口遇素不相識之陳增祥詢問如何檢舉及檢舉之利益，渠答稱不知，後由該隊辦案人陳文貽及周文達（按陳·周二人，前經警備部判處有期徒刑五年，今在押中）邀渠及其他穿軍服者四五人，將吳拘捕。至於拘吳有無正式拘票，吳押於何處，渠因不識字，概不知情，嗣因代借桌櫈事，由薛建樹送渠五百萬元，作為酬勞。</p>
<p>答辯六點理由</p>
<p>末由戚之私人秘書蔣石林答供：在稽査大隊無任何名義，僅以私人秘書資格，替戚辦事，與金·郁等或在隊部，或在戚家相値，惟均不熟悉，對吳寳康被檢舉案之前前後後，絕不知情，雖與隊部出納薛建樹相　，然不知其因吳案曾有洽送賄款之事，渠本人亦未收受任何賄款·供畢並聲稱依刑法第九十六條，要求答辯數點，說明渠與吳案毫不相關：（一）渠非吳案之共犯，受賄名單及支票存根，均無其名，（二）吳案係某一部份人之陰謀陷書，（三）戚再王案發生後，各被吿供詞，對渠一無牽涉，（四）戚在警備部之自白書，未說渠曾受款，（五）追繳賄欲，與渠無關。並對上述第（二）點陰謀陷害，復逐條申述，旋經庭上加以制止。嗣傳證人吳寳康（現因案覊押特種刑庭），陸儒卿及薛建樹三人，均未到庭，由各被吿律師相繼辯論後，定期本月十一日下午四時宣判，蔣石林當予保釋候傳，金·郁二人還押。</p>

<h3 id="c104">與陳公洽氏一席談　建設浙江的一個新輪廓 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報杭州二日訊〕陳公洽氏蒞浙主政三經已個月了，在這三個月中，他施行了公文改革，採用分層負實，不必一定要由主管長官批閱公文，又取消了武裝的門術，完全用便衣警來把守省府大門，另外成了一個問訊處，處內由蔫任職員一人担任答問工作，此外更易了很多縣長，調動了很多縣長。在這些行動上，我們不能說他不是一種新的作風，但我們又不能不說他顯得太瑣碎，因為今天的浙江，也是金國的縮影，問題只有一個，就是經濟情形亟待改善。為了這，記者曾與陳公洽氏在他的辦公室內作過一度較長的談話，他承認當前的問題是在經濟上面，但改善經濟，談何容易，’現在他先從整理財政着手，過去的賬，未免有些含糊，他說：「杭州市財政經整理後，比較好得多了。省財政也要把他整理出一個眉目來。不過省銀行的資本，只有五萬金圓，這樣一個綰轂全省金融，流通全省經濟血液的銀行，只有這一點點資金，如何辦理新興的事業」？據他的意思，要把省銀行資本金增加到五百萬元。</p>
<p>多下錢來營養浙江</p>
<p>他想辦的事很多，從前他在福建省銀行可以發行角分票，這樣可以週轉很多資金，現在當然不可能了。所以他要運用浙省的物資，把物資流籌管制，對外貿易，將貿易所得，振興浙省的實業·為了這，他特地成立了一個物資運用委員會，這個會，不屬於建廳，而是單獨直屬於省府的。據說沒有經費，要他在自給自足之餘多下錢來營養浙江。第一步想把綠蔴管制運用，第二步想把餘姚的二百多萬畝棉田與鎭海一帶的一百多萬畝棉田，積極改良種棉，加以管制運用。如果物資運用能够成功，則據陳公洽氏的看法，浙江前途有着無限的光明。</p>
<p>輕便鐵道籌建兩條</p>
<p>陳公洽氏的另一計劃，就是籌建輕便鐵道，成立輕便鐵道籌備處。據他說：今後的汽油還要貴，汽車的零件幾乎都要仰賴外國，我們把輕便的鋼軌敷設在公路上，可以收回國家很多外匯，而且產生較多於汽車運輸的效率。倘使覺得輕便鐵道不好，只要把他拆去，仍舊是很好的公路。」他預備先建輕便鐵道兩條：一條是從紹興百官，從百官到鎭海。一條是從曹娥到天台，天台到臨海的海門。這兩條鐵道，據他的看法，是增加了浙江兩個出口，可以把內地許多土產往外銷，同時，外面很多東西也可以運進來。</p>
<p>甌江靈江發展水利</p>
<p>關於農田水利，他的意思，街口永力發電，一時旣然不易成功，那麼甌江和靈江也可以設法水力發電，大概可以有一萬瓩。他肯定的說：如果不能運用水力發電，則原動的力量卽感缺乏，而沒有了原動力，農村也就沒有方法進步。所以在他的計劃中，甌江與靈江的水利工程，一定要辦，但是要辦起來，一定要一筆巨額的資金。</p>
<p>農民學校積極創辦</p>
<p>他現在立刻要舉辦一種農民學校，這種學校不屬於敎育廳，而是直屬於省政府的。他的理想是灌輸農民以新的智識和技術，先設一個農民學校籌備委員會，定期招取甲乙兩班師資，加以訓練，甲班須大學農學院畢業者，乙班須高中畢業，服務於文敎界者。據陳公洽氏吿訴我：這個學校的理想，是想招收一班優秀而年靑的農民入學，入學後，卽授以田地三畝，令其按照師長所敎學者耕種之，畢業後，這田地仍由他耕種，收穫也由他支配。這樣下來，一定入學的人會大大的增加，而且新的農業智識與技術也大大的深入了農村。土地政策也算實行了不少。他決定校長一定要大學畢業，校長必須以身作則，也與學生一樣操作。</p>
<p>利用礦產換取物資</p>
<p>另外，關於工業方面，平陽的礬礦，靑田的鉏礦，武義的銻礦，其中鉏與鉘是煉鋼主要的原料，礬是一切鋼精製成品的重要原料。他現在正計劃着，想利用這許多礦產來換取浙江所需要的東西。</p>
<p>記者曾問他是不是要出巡？要不要召集各縣的首長舉行一次工作的檢討與計劃？他的回答是：「不想出巡，因為雖然你三令五申要地方上不必招待，但地方上總是預備着的，不免勞民傷財。目前暫不舉行會議，只要機構靈活，便可如臂之使指。」</p>
<p>審細察徵努力邁進</p>
<p>這一番談話後，我覺得陳公洽氏建設浙江的輪廓，確是刻劃得很燦爛，不過中國人做事，往往七分人事，三分辦事，單就管制運用物資這一項來說，是不是會影響到一些地方上有勢力的人的利書？這也恐怕不能完全說不會。那麼，陳公洽氏如果面臨這個難題時，將採什麼方法來對付呢？這似乎是値得訊的的吧。我們熱望陳氏這番為浙江畫下的新輪廓，能够一一如期實現。我們更熱切地希望陳氏要領導着全省的公務員，不懼不餒，審細察微地向着指標邁進！</p>

<p>（一）根據蘇浙皖京滬區棉紡公會提議，請求政府統籌原棉，在全面供應計劃之下，為穩定聯購價格，得使國棉充分供應，贊同考慮主管機關，及國棉聯合採購會之全國採購計劃，各廠一律放棄自購國棉。經對論結果，各代表一致同意，並請聯購委員會迅速通過實施，在國內各大產棉集散中心設聯購分處，以便全面購買。</p>
<p>（二）又聯購委員會對棉花之攙水攙難，及業外人爭購棉花，呈請政府嚴格取締一點，希望，當局早日通令各省市縣政府嚴予執行。對於棉商收花，希望勿有巨額存量，如有囤積嫌疑，亦將予以取締，紡聯會為此決建議聯購委員會，接受該會所推派之各地領袖，參加共同工作。人選為：西安石鳳翔，重慶潘仰出，漢口李國偉，天津楊亦周。</p>

<h3 id="c148">論中國菜 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 榮志</p>
<p>中國文化之其體表現，有一樣足以自豪而也是大家公認的，大概就是烹調罷。這話人人會講，但是細想起來，連烹調這一道都有沒落的趨勢，至少還需要努力，方能維持這種聲譽。</p>
<p>中國菜是有其一貫的藝術與哲學意味的，與詩文字畫山水園林向來配合，互有關聯。最緊要的一個原則是：無論一樣菜或一套的菜，必須各自維持其特殊性格，猶之乎作詩，如果這首詩裏面一半像漢魏，一半像晚唐，或是這首詩算某甲作的也可，算某乙作的也可，那就不是卓然可傳可供欣賞的詩了。</p>
<p>晚近烹調的門逕派別，大致分為淮揚·山東·福建·廣東·四川幾種，並非說此外沒有好菜，不過這是一望可知的宗派區別，這是大家公認的，猶如四王之於石溪石濤，面目全非，不能强同。在大都市之中，你願意領略那一種菜，就到那一種館子去。大概民國二十年以前，著名的館子大都還維持他的傳統作風，有些十分帶保守性的館子，甚至於只肯作幾樣固定的菜，呌你感覺十分恰到好處。近十幾年，風氣漸不同了。每一家館子都以模仿為能，於是家家的口味一般，甚至於樣樣菜的口味，都沒有大區別，這是給予中國菜的優點一個大摧殘。舉一個例來講，民十以前，核桃酪只有廣東私人家裏喫得到，其製法也比後來考究，其甜味是由於棗湯，而並不是加糖，後十年之間，竟至無一館子不備，無一頓不喫。中國人之不求甚解，人云亦云，眞是先天的，每見新書封面中用武梁桐畫象作圖案，千篇一律，便覺有同樣的悲嘆，漢畫中可用作圖案的很多，瓦當文不好麼，鏡文不好麼？無論甚麼事，濫到如此地步，總不會好的了。</p>
<p>味的感覺，最需要變化，西洋菜的花樣太多，是其缺點，然而其配合也有相得益彰之妙，比如熟的生的，脆的軟的，濃的淡的，乾的濕的，如不至於太偏於一方面。古人說，「以水濟水，誰能食之？一若不能薈萃衆長，推陳出新，各盡其用，何足以為好菜？一切藝術作品，最忌板與腐。要作到不板不腐，先須求眞，中國菜的基本好處，在乎保存原來的眞味到最大限度。有人以為白菜筍子豆腐之類本身沒有味道，其實不然，不一定是甜鹹的才算眞味道，淡的也是味道之一，不過這些原料富有中和性，一經配合他物，可以變化出無窮的新味，這種中和性的原料，是中國好菜所不可缺的。</p>
<p>每一樣菜之中，必有其主要部分。無論原料如何複雜，這點主要性不可失掉，譬如文章義法之有主有賓，配藥之有君臣佐使，一經變亂，其意味便又不同，在分量之間，在先後之間，或是在製法之間，要有分別。</p>
<p>古人說：一大羹不致」，烹調的最高境界，是沒有庸俗的味，正如至樂不在乎悅耳，美色不在乎悅目，中國藝術哲學所謂「超以象外，所謂一絢爛之極歸於平淡」，這個理是一貫的。俗傳各廚的三字訣是滾爛淡，雖然言之過甚，也足見此中有至理存焉。總之，凡屬調味的作料，以少用為是，尤其近來味精一類的東西，只可在不得已的時候，用以取巧救急，若以其為能增加鮮味而溫用之，無異於在至美的地毯之上再加一塊紅　，不惟無益，而又害之。</p>
<p>菜不但是喫的，而且是看的，是聞的，尤其是色彩之調和，形式之耕列，位置之經營，環境之陪襯，無一不關緊要。大概動物的形狀總不免惡劣，所以應該極力避免路出，至於蔬果的天然色澤形態，都有其本身的特殊優點，西洋人很講究這個，有人說西洋菜是看的，的確看了使人心曠神怡，食慾自然增進。這是人類六根的本能發展，用能享受優美的生活意義。中國菜之注重色香味就是這倘意思。許多蔬菜應該保存其原來的美麗形態（如芹菜，如油菜苔，如紅蘿蔔），保存其綠色素，在烹調技術之中，充分發揮其營養作用，方是正辦。許多人至今還不懂綠色素之重要，在己熟之後，還要蓋鍋，殊不知在沸油鍋中炒過，已經熟透了，旣不必再煮，除鹽外也不必加作料，方才保有生脆的美味。這種烹調，在酒菜館中，往往不易辦到，家庭主婦却不可不知。中國人不大講究喫生菜，這是　一大缺點，只好求之於凉拌碟子以濟其窮。又冬天的醃菜，旣簡單又經濟，容易下鈑，這裏面沒有失去天然本質，較之榨菜大頭菜之營養性大得多了。杜詩說：「脆添生菜美」，蘇東坡酒後喫寒　，現在北方還是這種喫法，他們的醃白菜，冷天是連冰入口的，喫雜醫麵必拌上生葱生蘿蔔生豆芽芫菜，他們又以王米小米為主食，飲食的分配比較合理，所以健康上好像强過南方人。</p>
<p>老子說：「治大國若烹小鮮」，這是講究親手作菜的人所引以自豪的一句話，這個究竟應如何解釋呢？我以為烹調之道通於政治，就在各安其所各盡其用，菜的材料幾乎沒有不能用的，在善於利用的，腐朽都可化為神奇，決不使有向隅之感，一經使用，又必使能充分發揮其獨有之優點，如此而巳，技進乎道，此之謂也。</p>

<p>— 斐宇</p>
<p>「暗示性」在心理學上亦稱做「暗示感受性」，是催眠術最基本的原理。我們時常會接受別人的暗示，而自已却不覺得。我現在這裏問諸位讀者一個問題：「在英文中說六加七（is）十四對呢，還是說六加七（are）子四對？」諸位一定有的以為用（is）對，也有以為應該用（are）對，而沒有想到六加七根本就不是十四。這是因為我在發問的時候就暗示諸位上而二句話中總有一句是對的，而二句的唯一不同就在於一個用（is）而另一個用（are），於是諸位就接受了我的暗示而儘望這二個字上而去想了。</p>
<p>我再在這裏請諸位計算一個題目，諸位只能看一遍題目，並且要算得極快。題目是：</p>
<p>「一輛搭客十五人的火車自起點開出，到下一站上三人下七人，再到下一站上六人下五人，再下一站上八人下十人，再下一站上九人下二人，再下一站上五人下十一人，再下一站上七人下三人，現在這火車停了幾站了？」</p>
<p>諸位要眞算得快的話，我相信詣位一定非回頭重數一遍就不能回答我。實際上那一站上幾人下幾人對我所要的答案根本就毫無關係，我故意將不必要的人數說了出來，於是讀者們就只算着人數而將站載置之不顧了。</p>
<p>兒童暗示感受性之强簡直可驚可笑。有人作了幾個實驗，測驗三十個小學兒童的暗示性，結果有趣之極。他先由一個法文敎師領進敎室介紹給孩子們，然後這敎員出去，他就開始問話。他先問他們法文敎師的鬍子是什麼顏色的。於是有十一個孩子說是棕色，八個說是灰色，五個說是白色，二個說是紅色，只有四個是說對了的，他們說他是沒有鬍子的。然後再問他們這敎師進來說話的時候是把帽子拿布左手裏呢還是拿在右手裏。結果有于七個說是拿在左手，十一個說是拿在右手，其餘二個算是聰明的，他們說是他手裏沒有拿帽子。而事實上呢，這敎師的帽子始終好好地戴在頭上！</p>
<p>在法庭上，暗示性時常很巧妙地被利用着來探出案情的眞相。有一個機械師在法庭上要求他任職着的鐵路公司給與贍養費，因為他的在臂在一次火車失事後就不能行動了。公司方而的律師很同情地問他，他的左臂現在能舉得多高。他很痛苦地舉起祗一吋光景。律師再問在出事前他的左臂是否完全健康，他答說是。於是這位律師就很客氣地說：</p>
<p>「現在讓我看看你的左臂在出事前能舉多高。」</p>
<p>原吿忽忙中不知不覺將左臂舉過了頭頂，於是引得滿庭大笑，眞相也就大白了。</p>

<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>上星期四因事到蘇州，在凱旋號車廂，讀着陳從周在本刋的「郁達夫生年」。我之所寫達夫在卅四年的五十四歲，是達夫遺囑上自己所寫的。這一點錯誤，容許當年是達夫故意的多寫幾年的年歲，等於他所寫杭州住宅的藏書五百多萬卷，和說經商八載，同樣的鋪張，也未可知。</p>
<p>事有湊巧，當我看畢從周這篇文章時，達夫的大兒子郁飛也同車往蘇州，坐在我的隔座。（星期三晚他曾到舍下談天，也說第二天早上到蘇州去。）我就問他的令先君的年歲。他說：今年幾多歲，一時記不淸楚，但僅記得是丙申年出世，算來好像是五十二歲。這樣一來，陳從周听說的，似是對的。而我那篇文章裏，只是照樣抄錄他的遺囑，當時沒有參考其他資料，替他說明，這該要聲明的。</p>
<p>關於達夫的幾個兒子近况，我想一般關心達夫遺孤的都很想知道概略吧。大兒子飛，現在上海某大學讀書，還有一年多，便可畢業，刻下住在峨眉路。他是研究政治學的，對於文學，雖屬愛好，但只視做「副業。幾年來，各刊物有寫述達夫的　聞逸事的，他也非常留心的集存。</p>
<p>談到達夫全集的問題，據遺囑所說，著作十餘種，迄今十餘年來，版稅一文未取。但據說達夫生前交給北新書局出版的書，共有九種。而此九種書的權利繼承人，不是他的三個兒子的名字。故達夫在遺囑上所說「若有人代向出版該書之上海北新書局交涉，則三子之在國內者，猶可得數萬元」的話，一則是沒右證件上的根據，二則是書局方面表示達夫的預支版稅，至今還是透支。如此，所證十餘年版稅一文未取，與向書局交涉可得數萬元，眞是各執一辭的了。而在此期間，違夫全集的編集，版權固成問題，而書的出版，銷路亦有疑問。故至今三年，還沒有人去着手編緝，不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>達夫的次子雲，刻在富陽，三子均，現在福建，都已上學讀書。三兄弟各處一方，努力學業，這是可以吿慰關心達夫遣孤的文友的，順便附說幾句。</p>

<p>徐子晋前淸同光之際一骨董商耳，乃名滿海內，江建霞太史為刊其所著一前　夢影錄」。世之治版本學者，復盛道其書不置。子晋此書所記雖僅文房紙研法書名畫書籍，昔賢所謂皆小道耳，然皆眞知灼見，實有可觀。</p>
<p>子晋名康，號竄叟，吳郡人。主吾鄕舊山樓趙氏至久，為趙非昔先生審別所藏骨董。吳苦鐵嘗言：「子晋精鑒賞，金石書畫，到手皆能別其眞贗，今日之宋商邱也。」苦鐵目高於頂，不輕許可人，其言如此，可以知子普之學矣。</p>
<p>余今春在蘇州琴川書店購得子晋手批「松心筆記」抄本，有一徐康」「　客」「上池仙館」三藏印，復有子晋兩長跋。是書為子普猶子子瑜手抄。此筆記乃醫案，吳門繆松心老人撰。松心為文子之子，世代替纓，餘事及岐黃之術。子晉手跋稱；「以上皆老人新製之方，精思妙理，方得水到渠成。今之為醫，皆係粗工，學不終日，卽求速化，汲汲懸　，以謀升斗。聞緊難而茫然，見虛實為不辨。余嘗謂古之士大夫皆通醫理，卽專門名家，亦必學問深長，無論隱顯，但足不朽。今士大夫鄙之為賤術，而為醫者又皆浮浪子弟，讀書少資，為商乏力，無聊學醫，漫於一試。………」子晋深於醫理，故其言痛切若是。</p>
<p>子晋之子翰卿，能世其學。嘗偽造「度遼將軍印」以欺吳憲　中丞，中丞得此印，遂舊志請纓，赴倭寇之難，終乃敗北，此書生紙上談兵之過也。「孽海花」說部中以「余漢靑」隱射翰卿之名。愙齋精於鑒古，乃竟為翰卿所欺；則翰卿之家學亦足多已。惜乎不軌於正道，僅以工於作偽稱於時也。子晋之學則原原本本，殫見洽聞，固不屑為之。然今之骨董商，則並此作偽之術亦且缺如矣。</p>

Du paid a visit to the President at 8 pm on the 3rd. He claimed that he came here to ask for leave to go home and see his family.

<h3 id="e12">Chen Xueping Issues Statement. The Government Cares About Displaced Youths from the Northeast. Unreasonable Demands Will Not Be Accepted. <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Beiping, 4th dispatch] Students from private colleges and universities in the Northeast went to the presidential residence in Hou Yuan En Temple on the 4th to petition, requesting that they be allowed to join the national colleges and universities in the Northeast without taking an exam. They wanted to organize a team to carry out the petition yesterday, but they were temporarily stopped by the police and constabulary. On the morning of the 4th, they disintegrated into smaller groups and gathered hundreds of people near Hou Yuan En Temple. The police and constabulary imposed a curfew nearby. The students then sent five representatives to be met by Chen Xueping on behalf of the President, who promised to convey their demands to the President.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 4th dispatch] Minister of Youth Chen Xueping issued a statement regarding the petition of students from the Northeast in Beiping to see the President, saying: "The Ministry of Education has restored the four national colleges and universities in the Northeast and established temporary high schools to enable most students to study. Only 1,800 students from private colleges and universities are urgently trying to find a way to settle in. On the morning of the 4th, five representatives of these students visited the President to petition and made two requests: (1) Establish a temporary college; (2) Or be unconditionally accepted by national colleges and universities. I was assigned to meet with them on behalf of the President and refused their demands. The grading test for students from the Northeast was to give them the opportunity to study in national colleges and universities, but unfortunately, a small number of students disrupted the test site. It is regrettable. In the future, in addition to those who follow the rules to participate in the grading test and can still join the colleges and universities, there will be no alternative even if they visit the President to petition again. At that time, I made four suggestions to the student representatives: (1) Students from provincial technical colleges are easier to solve, and the admission problem can be handled immediately. (2) The four national colleges and universities will give them another opportunity to take the grading test, and they will be admitted leniently. After admission, they will be given strict training. (3) Tianjin cram school will start classes immediately, and an office will be set up in Beiping. In addition to the basic courses, elective specialized courses will be added according to the department. (4) The problem of food and housing can be solved after grading and admission. Those who are not admitted will be assigned to the cram school. Winter clothes will be discussed with Commander Fu and fundraising will be conducted from all parties. Finally, Minister Chen emphasized: "The government cares about the displaced youths at all times and tries its best to rescue them and promote their education. However, unreasonable demands will never be accepted. It is beyond the scope for a small number of students to smash theaters and obstruct traffic. Most students should unite to punish them."</p>

<h3 id="e20">US House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. Advocates Expanding Economic and Military Aid to China. Emphasizes the Importance of China to the World Situation. <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 3rd dispatch] The US House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee strongly advocated on the evening of the 3rd to provide China with greater economic assistance and substantial military assistance, as China is the "decisive region" in the worldwide struggle between communist Soviet Union and democratic Western systems. The committee, led by Congressman Bolton, issued a formal report stating: "The United States is the only country in the world today with the political power to assist China and effectively guarantee its territorial integrity." It also stated: The continued existence of China in the form of a democratic country is very important to the security of all democratic countries. The committee report emphasized that if China is to be stabilized, the United States should immediately supply China with finished products and raw materials. Regarding military aid to China, the committee said: What the Chinese government needs is mainly rifles and other simple equipment. The committee's report is the g-th piece of its series of reports on communist parties around the world, describing the development and expansion of the Chinese Communist Party. The committee criticized the United States' forcing China to establish a joint government including the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as an unprecedented extreme act. The report also stated: When the United States abandoned its efforts to mediate and persuade the National Government to accommodate the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party was ready to use its old tricks and launch a new civil war. Discussing the current situation in China, the report stated: China is an independent country, and the fate of China will determine the fate of half of the people in the East.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 3rd dispatch] The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, chaired by Bolton, recently issued an important report stating: The Communist Party is currently using China as a laboratory to study the technology of conquering 1.5 billion people around the world. The Chinese government has failed to defeat this wild attempt on its own for various reasons. The United States should provide substantial assistance in a timely manner to avoid "losing" China.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Legislative Yuan's Finance and 金融 Monetary Affairs and Legal System Committees. Enthusiastically Discuss the Increase in Tax Rates. Deputy Finance Minister Xu Said that Balancing Income and Expenditure is a Real and Urgent Pain. <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The various committees of the Legislative Yuan met separately on the 4th to handle the cases submitted to the Yuan for review. The Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee completed the initial review of the Film Inspection Law Amendment Draft in the afternoon, and all penalties were reduced. The National Defense Committee continued to secretly review the Jinan campaign in the morning. The Joint Meeting of the Transportation, Economic, and Resources Committees completed the initial review of the case of State-owned or Publicly-owned Enterprises Not Being Allowed to Increase Prices Arbitrarily in the morning. The Joint Meeting of the Finance and 金融 Monetary Affairs and Legal System Committees reviewed the case of requesting the Executive Yuan to promptly submit the relevant tax increase decision to the Legislative Yuan for review and completion of the legislative procedures. The Budget Committee revised and passed the review procedures for the re-compilation of the national budget in the afternoon. The Joint Meeting of the Social Affairs, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committees reviewed the draft amendment to the Farmers' Association Law in the afternoon. After listening to Liangzhang Guan Jiyu explain the grain management policy, the Joint Meeting of the Criminal Law and Grain Administration Committees preliminarily reviewed the Draft Regulations on Punishing Crimes of Violating Grain Management, and decided to revise the draft clauses in accordance with the principles of taking into account social needs and people's sufferings.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The Finance 金融Monetary Affairs and Legal System Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting at 9:00 am on the 4th, chaired by Xie Xingqu, to discuss the case submitted by Cheng Tianfang and others, requesting the Executive Yuan to promptly submit the changed tax rates to the Legislative Yuan for review in order to complete the Legislative Yuan's procedures. First, Xu Baiyuan, the acting Finance Minister who was invited to attend the meeting, explained the situation of the tax rate increase. Xu pointed out three points: (1) The increase in salt tax was based on the emergency decree promulgated by President "August 19"; (2) The customs duty was added in accordance with the new tariff rate approved by the Legislative Yuan; (3) The commodity tax was collected in accordance with the tax rate approved by the Legislative Yuan. Then, the members questioned the points. The main points were that the increase in salt tax was too heavy, ignoring the people's livelihood and the resolution of the Legislative Yuan in the previous session, and raised the issue of the scope of the President's use of emergency powers under the temporary clauses and the issue of the Legislative Yuan's procedures for increasing tax rates. After Minister Xu answered once, the members stood up and questioned each other, mostly criticizing the Executive Yuan for ignoring the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan. Then, Minister Xu answered again, and the main points were as follows: (1) The tax rate increase was based on the emergency decree. Whether it should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures is subject to interpretation. If it is considered that it should be submitted for review, the administrative authorities should submit it for review. (2) At that time, the planning was indeed very cautious, but in order to balance income and expenditure, there was a real and urgent pain. (3) Although the salt tax has increased, the burden on the people is not too heavy. (4) The increase in salt tax did not dare to delay in time in order to prevent abuses. At that time, it was really unavoidable. After Minister Xu's second reply, he retired. The members raised opinions on how to review the case, and the speakers were very enthusiastic and thoroughly discussed it. After repeated and detailed discussions, it was unanimously believed that this case should wait for the Executive Yuan's written reply to the Legislative Yuan's inquiries about the emergency decree in the first two secret meetings before merging and discussing it, and the members convened by the Finance 金融Monetary Affairs Committee should study it first before adjourning the meeting at noon.</p>
<p>State-owned and Privately-owned Enterprises Are Not Allowed to Increase Prices Arbitrarily</p>
<p>Two Committees Determine Standard Prices</p>
<p>The Transportation, Economic, and Resources Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 4th, chaired by Xing Huatie. The proposed draft of Wang Zemin that state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned enterprises are not allowed to increase prices arbitrarily was initially reviewed. After listening to the reports of Ling Hongxun, Deputy Minister of Transportation, and Luo Junshu, representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, on the business conditions of various state-owned and publicly-owned enterprises, two points were decided: (1) The price increase of state-owned, publicly-owned, or privately-owned enterprises should be submitted by the business agencies to the administrative authorities for approval, and the proposed adjusted price should be submitted to the people's organizations at the same level for review, and the relevant laws and regulations should be modified to the Legislative Yuan. (2) It is recommended that the Executive Yuan formulate standard prices for state-owned, publicly-owned, or privately-owned enterprises within three months, and make a comprehensive planned economic control before making reasonable adjustments.</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan to Discuss Reduction and Exemption of Field Tax in Disaster Areas Today</p>
<p>Confidential Documents of the Yuan Leaked Again</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold its eighth meeting on the 5th to discuss: (1) The proposal by Qian Nashui and others to relieve the flood victims in various provinces by reducing and exempting field tax in the disaster areas. (2) Peng Jiangkang and others requested the Executive Yuan to order the salt affairs authorities to allocate special funds under the salt farm construction fee to develop the welfare of salt workers. (3) Jin Shaoxian and others proposed to request the Executive Yuan to order the ministries and committees to submit periodic administrative reports to the Yuan. (Four other cases have been seen on the first page of this newspaper on the 4th, omitted)</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] During the first session of the Legislative Yuan, the leakage of the Yuan's secret meeting contents by a few newspapers aroused the attention and investigation of most legislators. President Sun Ke specially proposed a "gentleman's agreement" at the reception for reporters, agreeing that for news that has not yet been released, even if the journalists know it, they will temporarily keep it secret for the benefit of the country and the people and will not publish it. For several months, the press has been very gentlemanly and obeyed the agreement. Unexpectedly, one or two newspapers have recently published confidential documents of the Yuan that have not yet been released, which has aroused the attention of some legislators again. It is heard that the Yuan's Press Office has been ordered to collect relevant materials and submit them to the Secretary-General for reporting to the Yuan's meeting to request the Yuan's meeting to decide on a solution.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Editorial: Panic Buying, Floating Capital, and Production <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a phenomenon of panic buying has emerged in the market. It was first observed in Chengdu, and subsequently in Chongqing, Kunming and other places. These occurrences have specific reasons, namely, the so-called nickel coin crisis, which we will not discuss for now.</p>
<p>However, the panic buying phenomenon in this city has no specific cause. It is merely due to (1) the strict enforcement of price controls, which is more thorough than in other places. The general perception is that prices are cheap, so people seize the opportunity to buy more, lest they miss out. (2) Because the supply of a few special commodities, such as meat, eggs, and vegetables, as well as Western medicines like penicillin, has occasionally been short, people associate this with other goods, thinking that the same situation may occur. (3) Since the currency reform, prices in this city have been generally very stable. The authorities have repeatedly announced that all price limits from "August 19th," except for certain commodities related to foreign exchange and increased taxes, will be reasonably adjusted, and the rest will remain unchanged. However, the expectation of rising prices in some people's minds has not been completely eliminated. (4) Scalpers have fueled the fire, creating a trend of panic buying. (5) There is an abundance of floating capital with nowhere to go, and although production is supposedly being safeguarded by the authorities, it is still excessively restricted, unable to attract floating capital. This leads to the spontaneous attack on goods by scattered surplus purchasing power in the hands of the people. Among the various factors mentioned above, except for the abundance of floating capital, which has been unanimously called for by all parties and indeed needs to be improved as soon as possible, the other points (1, 2, and 3) are actually unfounded and must be said to be caused by psychological misperceptions.</p>
<p>The reason is quite clear. Regarding the breaching of price controls, although some merchants, accustomed to old habits, may still expect it to happen, the authorities' attitude is firm and has not relaxed at all. We really have no indication to believe that the current cheap goods will soon disappear and be unattainable. Moreover, the implementation of economic controls is not only increasing but also becoming more comprehensive. For example, the establishment of economic supervisors in Central China and the expansion of the Shanghai area to include three provinces and two municipalities. These measures clearly aim to strengthen controls so that prices in various regions can match Shanghai, rather than relaxing controls in Shanghai to allow it to match other regions. Therefore, the future prices, except for commodities related to foreign exchange and increased taxes, are indeed unlikely to generally rise.</p>
<p>As for supply, with the outflow of goods still under strict control, this city's finished products actually only have a surplus and will not feel a shortage. The market is also not expected to fluctuate. Because Shanghai is the number one commercial port for imports in China and the main center of the national industry, these imported goods and manufactured products usually reach every corner of the country. Except for a very few commodities with special reasons, the quantity of storage can support several months at least. Moreover, before the export of goods returns to normal and still requires permission, how could there be a problem with the supply of these stored goods to the five million people in this city? Furthermore, the authorities have recently been actively seeking ways to open up foreign exchange, and to facilitate the supply of raw materials to factories, expanding allocations and preparing to barter with other regions. With such a two-pronged approach to production and sales, Shanghai will remain the economic center of the country, and the various goods sold locally will only account for a small part of it, so there is no need to worry about shortages.</p>
<p>What is truly concerning is how to absorb the floating capital. Currently, the government has implemented countermeasures such as the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, the promotion of short-term Gold Yuan treasury bonds, the liquidation of enemy and puppet assets and surplus materials, and the deadline for commercial banks to increase their capital. These measures are all underway. However, according to the report of the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee, as of September 30, the total amount of Gold Yuan issued nationwide has reached more than 950 million yuan, almost half of the legal issuance amount. And that doesn't include the legal tender and Northeast circulation notes that are circulating outside and have not been recovered. If a way to quickly withdraw this huge amount of currency is not found, the potential for threatening prices and tempting speculation and hoarding cannot be ignored! In this situation, if the authorities remain indifferent, thinking that panic buying is just a result of citizens' psychology, and do not consider ways to encourage floating capital to be used for production, the consequences are worrying! So how can a large amount of floating capital be quickly recovered? How can floating capital be turned to increase production? We believe that:</p>
<p>First, the simplest method is to restore interbank fixed deposits and return them to the central bank's vault. This was the old method before the currency reform and is also the most convenient procedure. As long as the interest rate is reasonably set, so that commercial banks do not suffer obvious losses, the power to absorb floating capital will probably be more effective than any other method. The problem is that if the central bank cannot use this deposit like other banks, it will inevitably lose interest. However, for the sake of the overall economic situation, the country's small loss seems to be not entirely meaningless. Moreover, the central bank is the bank of banks and has the responsibility to regulate finance and control currency. At this time when funds are too loose and cannot be immediately absorbed, it seems inappropriate to stand idly by and do nothing!</p>
<p>Secondly, the fundamental problem is still to start with encouraging production. After the central bank absorbs floating capital, it should immediately conduct strict assessments. As long as it is truly a new production enterprise, or an expansion of production equipment, or the purchase of production raw materials, loans can be granted or mobile funds can be lent in the form of orders, so that most of the floating capital in society can be invested in production enterprises through the financial industry, especially the central bank. On the one hand, funds have legitimate uses, and on the other hand, materials can be increased, which can eliminate the current strange phenomenon of "not engaging in production but specializing in grabbing materials."</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to straightforwardly remind the government and the people of the two most important points: (1) There is only limiting consumption, and there is absolutely no limiting production. If the authorities' intention is to limit consumption, and other measures may cause those engaged in production to hesitate, or even cause legitimate industrialists and businessmen to have the illusion that they may be blamed at any time, and they all tend to tighten and become passive, then even if there are a lot of stored materials, there will inevitably be a day when the mountains are eaten away. Therefore, the government should immediately use various facts to express its determination to support production enterprises, so that legitimate industrialists and businessmen have no doubts. (2) The Gold Yuan policy must succeed and not fail. The good and law-abiding people have handed over their gold, silver, and foreign currencies, declared their foreign exchange assets, and exchanged them for Gold Yuan. The government has the responsibility to protect their property and maintain the value of the Gold Yuan. On the other hand, it also has the obligation to make the powerful and wealthy also abide by the law, hand over their assets, and support the national policy, so that it can gain the complete trust of the general public. At the same time, the people should also trust the government, change their old mentality of valuing goods and undervaluing currency, value the Gold Yuan notes in their hands, and cherish their use. It should be known that this Gold Yuan policy has truly brought the people and the government to the point of sharing the same fate economically. If the people only know how to grab materials and do not invest in production to increase materials, then the day when the materials are all grabbed is the day when the national economy completely collapses!</p>
<h3 id="e23">### "Scalpers" Flock to Suzhou and Hangzhou, Many Shops Close to Avoid Them, Panic Buying in Wuxi is Also Chaotic <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 4th] Today, a large group of scalpers came from Shanghai to Suzhou and went to various shops to panic buy goods, first focusing on wool yarn, Western medicines, and other important daily necessities, and then competing to buy wool, cloth, hardware, and other items. These people are all young men and women, with a large organization and strong financial resources. The stores in Suzhou were already running low on stock, barely able to cope with the market every day. Seeing the situation was not good, most of them closed their doors to avoid them. Currently, the authorities believe that these people are disrupting the market and harming the people's livelihood, and have ordered them to be arrested and dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 4th] Shanghai scalpers came to Hangzhou and bought a large number of foreign cosmetics, making the shortage of goods in the market even worse. Today, prices have suddenly become serious, and cigarette and candy stores have closed down. Cloth stores closed at 3 pm, gold stores only opened briefly in the morning, and the rice market is short of goods, with citizens scrambling to buy them. Except for a few items such as soap, there is a black market for everything, and artificial silk has exceeded the price limit by a large margin.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 4th] Because the tobacco, alcohol, and foil tax have been ordered to increase, but Wuxi has not yet implemented it, serious disputes have arisen due to panic buying. The Command Post, the Pacification and Reconstruction Team, and the County Government held a meeting this afternoon at 4 pm and decided to increase the tax accordingly. The increase will be confirmed tomorrow morning and implemented immediately to prevent scalpers from panic buying.</p>
<p>In addition, people in Wuxi are panic buying various daily necessities, and the situation is chaotic. Silk and cloth stores are finding it difficult to cope and are closing early, euphemistically calling it "organizing inventory and registering." Although the authorities have arrested some scalpers, their number has actually increased. The yarn industry recently petitioned the county government, requesting that the crackdown be strengthened. Oil factories are also facing a standstill in production due to high raw material prices and shortages, and have also petitioned the county government for relief. Currently, the county government has decided to send a telegram to the Economic Supervision Office to request the transportation of oil for relief. Due to the shortage of flour, the flour industry has decided to register exports and require flour factories to supply the raw noodles industry.</p>

<p>Pacification and Reconstruction Team Launches Inspection</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Recently, the market in Zhenjiang has been chaotic. In addition to silver stores having temporarily closed down today, rice mills have stopped supplying retail stores on the pretext of stopping the daily power supply. Various foreign goods have also become paralyzed due to increased tax rates. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth have also disappeared at the same time. Chairman Ding of the Jiangsu Provincial Government personally went on a private tour today. He will severely punish illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate prices. Also, a part of the Pacification and Reconstruction Team has arrived in Zhenjiang and is actively launching inspection work.</p>

<p>[Our Nantong Correspondent, 4th] As cotton is being put on the market, many purchasing companies are using tampered scales to cover up black markets. Because the cotton-producing area is unstable and adulterated cotton is evading inspection, it is being transported to Haimen for export, resulting in a quiet cotton market here. Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Factory and its subsidiary factory need 1,000 piculs of cotton every day, but they can only purchase more than a dozen today. The gap is huge, and the cotton inventory is only enough for 20 days, which is worrying.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 4th] The Grain Department's Emergency Purchase and Storage Association entrusted the Agricultural Bank to exchange fertilizer for 1,600 tons of rice in Zhejiang. 600 tons have already been collected, but the authorities ordered the transportation to stop because it would affect the people's food supply.

<p>[Our Hefei Correspondent, 4th] Rice, grass, and pork have disappeared today, and residents are at risk of running out of food. Most restaurants have also closed. A small amount of Huainan coal has arrived, but it has not yet been widely supplied. New goods have arrived at department stores, cloth stores, and cigarette stores outside Dongmen, but it is said that they have been sealed up, and merchants cannot open the boxes to serve the market.</p>

<p>[Our Xining Correspondent, 4th] Since the Xining Central Bank began recovering gold, silver, and legal tender, the numbers have been increasing daily.

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The deadline for banks and money shops in remote provinces to increase their capital may be slightly extended compared to the deadline for capital increases for banks and money shops in major cities. The extension period is currently being studied by relevant parties. The reason for the extension is that transportation is difficult in remote provinces. By the time the Ministry of Finance's measures to adjust the capital of banks and money shops reach these areas, most of the capital increase period has already passed. To take actual difficulties into account, the capital increase period for banks and money shops in remote provinces may be extended to two months after the Ministry of Finance's measures reach them. However, this measure still needs to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after it is formulated. In addition, the method of using cash deposited in the Central Bank within three months after the capital increase of banks and money shops will also be submitted for discussion at this week's Executive Yuan meeting and announced after approval.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] In addition to suspending the operations of various illegal banks and money shops in the past, the Ministry of Finance has also imposed penalties on the Hankou Zhongdao Money Shop and the Tianjin Pinghe Silver Bank by revoking their licenses after inspection. The reason for revoking the license of Zhongdao Money Shop is that it was privately issuing gold notes, setting up secret accounts, and trading in goods. The reason for revoking the license of Pinghe Silver Bank is that it was forging documents. In addition, the Shanghai Dadao Money Shop, the Hankou Jinan Money Shop, the Shanghai Tongyu Yongji Money Shop, and the Chongqing Tonghui Bank were also found to have set up secret accounts, issued unauthorized promissory notes, and altered account records. They have all been sent to the court for punishment.</p>

<p>Method of Use Will Be Improved</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The guiding principles for loans to industry, agriculture, and mining can be determined on the 7th by the Four-Bank Joint Council. It is heard that the target and scope are roughly the same as in the past, but the method of using the loans will be changed compared to the past. In the past, the loans were drawn in one lump sum after approval. In the future, they will remain in the bank and be drawn in installments when used. In addition, the assessment will also be stricter.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 4th] The Beiping Municipal Government held an economic conference today. Zhang Lisheng attended and instructed: (1) All industries requesting price negotiation, except for alcohol, which can increase prices according to the increased tax, are not allowed. The price limits of August 19th will be strictly enforced. (2) Farmers in the suburbs are encouraged to move grain to the city without any quantity restrictions. Zhang also announced that the general distribution of cloth will begin in Beiping and Tianjin on the 15th, with 7.8 yards per person, distributed once every three months.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 4th] Beiping citizens can now buy grain, oil, and meat on the streets. A few merchants are appearing in small markets using the method of breaking up wholesale into retail, but they are still wary. The artificial grain shortage is gradually easing. In addition, the large batch of grain seized in the previous major inspection in Beiping has been processed and will be generally distributed at the limited price, with 2 catties per person, enough to buy grain for two days at a time.</p>

<p>[Our Chengdu Correspondent, 4th] To comprehensively control grain throughout Sichuan, the Sichuan Provincial Government has issued an order to all counties and cities to conduct a general survey of private warehouses, register grain reserves, conduct a practical investigation of supply and demand, and forcibly sell surplus grain, to be completed in October. Those who hoard or fail to sell surplus grain after the deadline will be sent to a special court for punishment. Wang Lingji told reporters today that Chongqing will work with Xu Kan, Zhu Shaoliang, and Yang Sen to supervise the transportation of military grain and organize Sichuan's defenses, with concrete decisions. He defended his price negotiation policy, saying that rising prices are happening all over the country, so why should Chengdu be unique? The provincial government has decided to relax the scale and adopt a reasonable price negotiation policy to take the facts into account.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] A platinum gauze screen worth US$40,000 is scheduled to be airlifted to China on the 18th to replace the old platinum gauze screen. The old item was stolen when the Yongli Nitric Acid Plant, recently returned to China, was still under the custody of the Japanese government. The platinum gauze screen is an important contact agent, and its return will allow the nitric acid plant to resume work. The Yongli Nitric Acid Plant in Nanjing is the largest of its kind in China. It is reported that its reconstruction work will soon be completed. The factory was looted by the Japanese in 1942 and was only returned to the Chinese government by Japan at the beginning of this year. However, the platinum gauze screen was stolen before the factory was returned. Therefore, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to remake a new platinum gauze screen. The stolen platinum gauze screen weighed seven catties and has not yet been found, but the thief has been apprehended and sentenced.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Prosecutor Requests Retrial of Case Involving Students Zhu Chengxue and Others Conspiring with Communists in Nanjing, Awaiting Justice to Achieve the Effect of Pacification and National Reconstruction <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] After students Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei, who were Communist spies at National Central University, and Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui, members of the Nanjing City Work Department Transportation Group of the Communist Party, were sentenced to six, five, and ten years in prison, respectively, by the Special Criminal Court of the Capital, they all felt that the sentence was too heavy and requested a retrial by the Central Special Criminal Court. However, the original prosecutor, Gu Rulun, believed that the original judgment was flawed in its determination of facts and application of the law and also requested a retrial. His petition for retrial stated that the defendants Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei were ideologically leftist when they studied at National Central University. They frequently contacted the leaders of the Democratic League, accepted instructions from Communist spies, engaged in subversive activities, directed leftist wall posters at National Central University, made reactionary propaganda from time to time, and incited student movements, leading strikes. These facts were verified by the Capital Garrison Headquarters, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Central Bureau of Statistics, respectively. The investigation reports were attached to the case file as evidence. However, the original judgment stated that the trial did not have sufficient positive evidence to support the allegations and should be dismissed. However, the Capital Garrison Headquarters and the Gendarmerie Headquarters have the duty to assist judicial organs in investigating crimes. This is clearly stipulated in the current Criminal Procedure Law and the Regulations on the Dispatch of Judicial Police. Therefore, their investigation reports should be based on facts discovered during the investigation. If no definitive evidence is found to prove that the investigation is not true, it cannot be considered untrue based on one's own subjective opinion. The original judgment expressed a lack of confidence in the investigations of the above three agencies but failed to explain the reasons for not adopting them. This is the first reason why the prosecutor believes that the original judgment's determination of facts cannot be considered appropriate. Furthermore, the defendants Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui served as members of the Nanjing City Work Department Transportation Group of the Communist Party, frequently carrying out transportation work for Communist spies. The defendants Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei were instructed by Communist spies to repeatedly incite student movements, propagate communism, and lead riots. The above-mentioned defendants had willingly joined the Communist Party organization, accepted their orders, and implemented various subversive activities in the rear area of the capital in order to achieve the Communist Party's plan to open a second war, echoing the Communist Party's riots in the front and working hard to consolidate their subversive foundation, so as to achieve the goal of overthrowing the government. The defendants should be held responsible for the crime of participating in the rebellion. What doubt is there? The prosecutor believes that the original judgment failed to address this in the charges listed in the indictment, which is the second reason why the prosecutor believes that the original judgment's application of the law is inappropriate. Based on the above two reasons, in accordance with Article 2 of the Special Criminal Court Trial Regulations and Article 10 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, the prosecutor requests a retrial, hoping to revoke the original judgment and render a suitable judgment, so as to avoid impunity and achieve the effect of suppressing chaos and building the nation.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Minister He's Earnest Speech at Reception for Taiwan慰問團　Suppression of Banditry is the unanimous demand of the whole nation　Confident that no rebellion cannot be quelled <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Fourth Dispatch] Minister He of the Ministry of National Defense, in his speech at the reception for the Taiwan慰問團 on the afternoon of the 4th, said:</p>
<p>You have come to Nanjing from Taiwan from afar, and will soon travel to various places to慰勞 the soldiers fighting against banditry. You will convey the concern and enthusiasm of the people of Taiwan for the soldiers to all officers and men, which will greatly boost morale and promote morale, so that all officers and men know that behind them, there are countless compatriots supporting them, hoping that they will complete the task of suppressing the rebellion as soon as possible and achieve the goal of national construction. Especially because the compatriots in Taiwan are far overseas and are not threatened by the banditry themselves, they are equally concerned about the officers and men at the front and give them warm慰勞, so this kind of enthusiasm and concern is especially precious and especially grateful.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, of course, have long understood that the current full-scale rebellion of the Communist bandits is the last obstacle to our national construction. We must overcome all difficulties and quell the banditry before the country can gradually enter a prosperous and happy state, and the people of the whole country can enjoy a peaceful and happy life. The country is a whole, indivisible, and compatriots across the country, regardless of region or province, are like a big family within the scope of the country. All blessings, misfortunes, advantages, disadvantages, and honor are related and common. The foolish and corrupt Qing government in the past did not understand this principle and abandoned the compatriots in Taiwan, allowing them to be slaughtered by Japanese imperialism. They did not know that Taiwan is an integral part of the entire China and is inseparable from the fate of the entire China. Therefore, from the Sino-Japanese War to the victory of the War of Resistance, the compatriots in Taiwan were of course ravaged by Japanese imperialism, and the entire China was also bullied by Japanese imperialism. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, Japan surrendered, the foreign troubles of the entire country were eliminated, and the compatriots in Taiwan also realized the desire for freedom and liberation and returned to the embrace of the motherland. At present, the full-scale rebellion of the Communist bandits has made it impossible for the country to engage in construction, and the compatriots in many provinces and regions cannot live and work in peace and have been displaced. Although the compatriots in Taiwan have not suffered this kind of pain, from the fact that you gentlemen represent all the compatriots and come here from afar, we can prove that the compatriots in Taiwan have unlimited enthusiasm for quelling the banditry and do not forget the difficulties faced by the entire country because of the stability of this province. From this fact, it can be proved that the suppression of banditry is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. We firmly believe that with the concerted efforts of the whole country, there is no rebellion that cannot be quelled.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Ying Qin personally went to various important cities and towns in Taiwan to handle the affairs of accepting the surrender of the Japanese army. He personally saw the education camp of the Taiwanese compatriots, the development of industry, the hard work and thrift of life, the good and stable social order, the loyalty and love to the country, and the active promotion of construction undertakings. He felt infinite gratification and believed that Taiwan is a model for our national construction and one of the bases for national rejuvenation. Today, I have such an opportunity to gather with you gentlemen again, representing officials from all over the country to accept the慰勞 of all the Taiwanese compatriots to the soldiers who suppressed the rebellion, and naturally feel especially excited. In order to enable the construction of Taiwan to have a demonstrative effect throughout the country, and the efforts of the compatriots in Taiwan to bear more satisfactory fruits on the road to national construction, I dare to guarantee that all the officers and soldiers will definitely work harder to repay the慰勞 of the compatriots in Taiwan and you gentlemen, and to fulfill the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country that our soldiers have shouldered.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourth Dispatch] The six members of the Taiwan Provincial慰問團, Huang Liandeng, Huang Zhenqiu, Chen Tianshun, Li Junyao, Xu Shixian, and Qiu Zhangmei, arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 4th to visit the central military authorities. They are scheduled to go to the front line to慰勞 the soldiers within a few days. The慰勞 goods they brought have been transported to Beiping, Shenyang, Xi'an, Taiyuan (a total of four tons), Xuzhou, and Yingkou (a total of two tons).

<h3 id="e56">Security Council Debates Berlin Incident Soviet Union Opposes Inclusion on Agenda Three Powers' Reply to Soviet Note Is Cold Insisting that Lifting the Blockade Is a Prerequisite for Resuming Negotiations <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council announced the opening of the meeting at 3:12 PM on the afternoon of the 4th in a tense atmosphere to discuss the case of the Western powers accusing the Soviet Union of threatening world peace by blockading Berlin. After the meeting began, the US representative, Austin, stated that the United States, as one of the parties to the dispute, should avoid the position of chairman in the discussion of this case. According to precedent, the chairmanship should be handed over to Argentina. However, because Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia is now in his home country, it is generally implied that Argentina will also transfer the chairmanship to a representative of another country. At the beginning of the debate, Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out that the Security Council has no right to interfere in the dispute between the East and West. He also said that the Soviet Union believes that the accusations of the Western powers are unfounded and beyond the scope of the Security Council's authority, so they should not be discussed in the Security Council. But the US representative replied coldly that, in any case, the Western powers will insist on their accusations to the end and formally rejected the Soviet Union's recent note suggesting that a four-power foreign ministers' meeting be convened to discuss the Berlin issue. The representative said that "the Soviet Union still refuses to lift the Berlin blockade and is still threatening world peace."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: Vyshinsky said in the Security Council that the United Nations' discussion of the Berlin issue violated the Potsdam Agreement, and the Soviet Union "does not want to be a party to this violation." Vyshinsky said, "We oppose placing this case on the agenda and insist that this agenda should not be adopted."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: After the Security Council adjourned, a reporter asked Vyshinsky, "If the Berlin issue is placed on the agenda, how will you deal with it?" Vyshinsky smiled and replied, "Don't worry, everything will be clear at the appropriate time." After saying that, he shook hands with the reporter, jumped into the car, and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin discussed the German issue with their advisors on the morning of the 4th and planned to meet with French Foreign Minister Schumann during the Security Council meeting in the afternoon. It was also reported that the three-power meeting ended at 5:40 PM in the afternoon, and the situation of the meeting was not revealed.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] The United States, Britain, and France decided on the 4th to reject the Soviet Union's suggestion to convene a new foreign ministers' meeting unless the Berlin blockade can be lifted unconditionally. A spokesperson for the three Western powers announced the Western position as follows: "No negotiations until the blockade is lifted. The blockade is the theme of everything." The Soviet Union broadcast its suggestion from Moscow Radio on the morning of the 4th and formally submitted it to the Western headquarters before noon to avoid the Security Council's debate on the Berlin issue at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, so the West announced its position in reply.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Soviet Union Requests Convening New Foreign Ministers' Meeting To Discuss Entire German Issue Accuses West of Violating Agreements and Undermining German Unity <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] The Soviet Union today demanded that the three Western powers hand over the entire German issue to the foreign ministers' meeting to avoid the Security Council's debate on the Berlin incident. A few hours before the Security Council was scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM this afternoon, Moscow Radio suddenly broadcast the Soviet Union's reply to the Western note of September 26, proposing the above suggestion. According to the Western note, the Soviet government was notified that the three countries had decided to abandon negotiations and submit the matter to the Security Council for arbitration. The Soviet reply insisted that the Moscow negotiations decided to issue instructions to the military governors of the four countries stationed in Germany, so the blockade issue had been resolved. It also said that the three Western powers should abide by the Moscow decision and should not arbitrarily use it to endanger the Soviet rights in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.</p>
<p>Moscow claimed that the Soviet Union requested that the East German Mark be recognized as the sole currency in Berlin, but this was only one of the conditions for lifting the blockade. However, the Western countries obstructed it by demanding that the four powers control the issuance of the Soviet Mark, which obviously endangers Soviet rights in the Soviet zone. The Soviet reply is expected to form the general tone of the Soviet representative's efforts in the Security Council to cancel the Berlin issue on the agenda. The Soviet reply argued that the Western zone's currency reform would affect the Soviet zone, so the Soviet Union had no choice but to blockade Berlin to protect itself. The Soviet Union also said that the Western zone's currency reform was only one of the many ways in which the West violated the Potsdam Agreement on a unified Germany and attempted to establish an independent West Germany. The Soviet reply also said, "The Berlin issue is closely related to the entire German issue and the establishment of a separate government in West Germany. According to Article 107 of the United Nations Charter, this matter should be handled by the countries responsible for occupying Germany and does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Security Council." The Soviet note ended by requesting that a foreign ministers' meeting be convened "according to the Potsdam four-power agreement" to consider the Berlin issue and the entire German issue. The Soviet reply acknowledged that the Soviet commander in Berlin had requested jurisdiction over the Western airlift in order to prevent black market money transactions between the East and West zones, which was unavoidable. "Because the governments of the United States, Britain, and France refused to implement the instructions, the negotiations failed even though the remaining differences were not very important." The note also said that the West demanded to interfere with the Soviet Union's banknote printing figures and attempted "to finally expel the Soviet Union" from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.</p>

<p>[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky continued the Soviet side's attack on the West in the UN General Assembly Political Committee on the 4th, extending from atomic warfare policy to personal slander. Manuilsky ridiculed the United States' "generous giving" in atomic energy and accused President Truman of aiming to maintain the United States' monopoly on atomic bombs to launch a new war. He said that the US New Deal has been destroyed by Wall Street, and the New Deal faction in the West has been replaced by warmongers who have abandoned all international agreements with atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>He accused US officials, including Truman, of being insincere. While US representative Austin made generous statements in the Security Council about the generous giving of atomic energy, Truman and military leaders made contrary statements. Manuilsky said that the United States demands that other countries sacrifice sovereignty in atomic energy, while it itself refuses to give up a single bit of sovereignty. "This is a narrow selfishness, but it is issued in the name of the American plan. If other countries retaliate and propose plans to make the United States give up sovereignty, then what will the United States say?" Manuilsky severely criticized the West for "not understanding the Soviet Union and not seeking to understand it," collecting information from the "garbage can" of White Russian exiles and Hitler's allies. He indirectly accused Western military attachés stationed in the Soviet Union of being responsible for espionage activities and said that if the West wants to understand the Soviet Union's internal affairs, it should consult "Western military attachés who sometimes carry cameras to visit our facilities." He announced that the United States' plan to control the atom "is fundamentally unacceptable." He also accused the US proposal of aiming to win overwhelming support from the UN General Assembly so that the United States could concentrate on manufacturing atomic bombs and recklessly prepare for a new war. Swedish representative Sandström declared that the Soviet Union's atomic control plan was not satisfactory, but still urged the great powers to continue negotiations.</p>

<p>[United Press Eglin Air Force Base, Florida Third Dispatch] Nine thousand troops and five hundred of the best aircraft from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force have gathered here on the 3rd to begin an important war combat exercise. The exercise began on the 3rd and is the first most important US demonstration of strength since the war. The tense situation in Europe has made it necessary for the United States to increase its strength. This exercise will last for three days to demonstrate new combat techniques, that is, the Army, Navy, and Air Force jointly launching a blitzkrieg attack on the target. Among them, 3,000 are students from the Air Force University, Staff College, Infantry Center Station, Radar School, and Marine Corps School. It is generally hoped that they can gain valuable experience. The area of ​​this exercise will cover three states (Florida, Alabama, and Georgia), including the latest jet aircraft, B-29 Superfortresses, and new aircraft of the Navy and Army. The Navy will send 100 aircraft from aircraft carriers, 100 Marine Corps fighters and attack fighters. The strategy of this hypothetical battle is as follows: The "Normukai" government has decided to attack the "Danrova" country and its capital "Aterlantis". The attackers attempted to split "Dan" into two and capture its capital. The southern attacking force includes strategic and tactical air forces, airlift forces, two-story forces, and the Navy. The airlift force will establish a stronghold in the Eglin area to complete supply tasks, and then attack the capital from the base. The airlift force in the center includes paratroopers and gliders. When they build a stronghold in "enemy territory", jeeps, artillery, and weapons will be sent by aircraft.</p>

<p>Determined Not to Abandon Revolutionary Achievements, Refuses to Make Peace with Western Powers</p>
<p>[French News Agency Belgrade Third Dispatch] The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ newspaper today continued to publish several documents related to the dispute between the Yugoslav Communist Party and the Communist Information Bureau, sternly refusing Yugoslavia's reconciliation with the Western powers. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ newspaper pointed out that Yugoslavia cannot cooperate with countries dependent on "imperialist" plans, and Yugoslav leaders will never abandon the achievements of the revolution. The newspaper also refuted other democratic countries' accusations of Yugoslavia, which are not based on facts and are purely due to selfish motives. The newspaper also disagreed with the view of some Soviet leaders that "any people's democratic country cannot survive after leaving the 'democratic front'." The newspaper pointed out that Yugoslavia already possesses all the prerequisites for a socialist economy. The isolation of other people's democratic countries by Yugoslavia may provoke "imperialists" to launch an aggression, but this kind of war can never be limited to the local area, and whether other people's democratic countries subjectively want to or not, they will eventually be forced into war. Finally, the newspaper replied to Pravda's accusation of political terror in Belgrade, stating that from beginning to end, only 50 people have been arrested for treasonous acts.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] 300,000 French coal miners began a general strike this morning to protest the Guy Mollet government's layoff order. As of now, no accidents have occurred. It is expected that some tin miners will also join the strike. In this strike, the General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, and the Christian Labor Union have quite different attitudes. The Communist-led General Confederation of Labor advocates an indefinite strike, while the Christian Labor Union advocates a 48-hour strike and attempts to reach an agreement with Economic Minister Lacoste. If a prolonged strike occurs, all economic activity in France will inevitably be paralyzed. French coal mines are state-owned, and Premier Guy Mollet has decided to reduce the number of government-affiliated workers as part of an economic plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 3rd] Communist labor leaders on the 3rd demanded that all workers in Rome hold a 15-minute sympathy strike on the 4th to support the 14,000 Rome city government employees who have been on strike for ten days. All businesses and offices are scheduled to close after lunch and stop working, so this strike will not affect the city's commerce, but public transportation will be disrupted. As labor leaders announced the "sympathy demonstration" plan, Communist newspapers declared that farmers across Italy would hold a meeting next week to support their demands for increased wages. At the same time, emergency sanitation crews were dispatched in Rome on the 3rd to clear garbage from the streets.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Authorities Suppress the Unhealthy Trend of Competitive Buying: Rationing Certificates for Woolen Cloth; Restrictions on Silk, Shirts, Trousers, etc. Will Also Be Implemented; Strict Thrift—No Meat Allowed on Fridays <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The trend of competitive buying did not abate yesterday. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian visited Supervising Commissioner Jiang Jingguo yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures, holding lengthy talks. According to Director Wu, it has been decided to implement a policy of periodic and quantitative rationing of essential goods as a temporary measure before the widespread implementation of a goods allocation system. All citizens purchasing essential goods must present their national identification cards. In addition to wool yarn, which is already subject to certificate-based rationing (1.5 pounds of coarse yarn and 1 pound of fine yarn), woolen cloth and fabrics will be limited to 1.5 zhang (approximately 5 meters) per person. Woolen cloth will be limited to one purchase per year, and fabrics to one purchase every three months, both based on presentation of a city national identification card. Purchases will be stamped on the back of the national identification card to prevent repeat purchases. The Social Affairs Bureau has instructed the relevant trade associations to implement this policy starting today. Silk and satin materials are also planned to be restricted soon, limited to one item per person. In the future, daily necessities such as shirts, undershirts, and socks will also be prepared for restricted purchase to curb panic buying.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to Director Wu, restricting meat consumption in the city has been verbally agreed upon by Commissioner Jiang and Mayor Wu. It is planned to imitate the American practice of not eating meat every Friday. On that day, the sale of pork, beef, and mutton will be prohibited, slaughterhouses will suspend slaughtering, markets will not supply meat, and restaurants will also stop selling meat dishes. This measure will be enforced strictly. Once Mayor Wu formally approves it, it will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Citizens Still Crowd to Buy Goods <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The objects of citizens' panic buying have expanded from daily necessities to everything. Department stores on Nanjing Road are crowded with men and women. Shirts, bedsheets, children's clothing, cosmetics, silk, woolen cloth, towels, socks, cotton and woolen shirts and trousers, etc., are all being snapped up. Even large companies like Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and The New Sun are out of all sizes of shirts. Display windows in watch shops no longer have brand-name watches on display; when asked, they say they have been sold out. The Parker pens that were once ubiquitous are now nowhere to be found in bookstores and stationery stores on Fuzhou Road. Even domestic pens such as Hua Fu, Golden Star, and Guan Le Ming are hard to come by. Camera stores no longer have Leica, Contax, Rolleiflex, and other valuable cameras, and various films are also being bought in bulk for storage. Even unpopular and outdated items like electric refrigerators still have buyers.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Along with the panic buying comes the rampant "single-carriers" (individuals carrying goods for resale) on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Because price-controlled goods in Shanghai can be sold for many times their price with just a short trip out of the station, all first, second, and third-class passenger cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, except for reserved-seat cars, are packed to the brim. The cars are filled with large and small packages everywhere, resembling "freight cars." The Office of the Supervising Commissioner has paid close attention to this phenomenon and will soon implement measures to inspect and stop it. If military personnel are found to be engaged in "single-carrying" activities, military police will be dispatched to arrest and severely punish them.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the city's small vegetable markets, the supply of pork has increased slightly recently due to the increase in the number of pigs arriving by ship, but demand still exceeds supply. Now, cities along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and rural areas near the city, having learned of the meat shortage in Shanghai, are trying to smuggle pork into Shanghai. Most of it is sold to restaurants at black market prices. It is rumored that some of this pork includes "sick pigs," "dead pigs," and "plague pigs." However, according to the Health Bureau, rural residents transport meat to Shanghai for profit, mostly in small quantities, which is essentially smuggling. They try every means to evade inspectors. After reaching the city, they directly trade with restaurants, so it is difficult to inspect whether the meat sold by restaurants is completely clean. In the future, we can only urge restaurants and citizens to pay close attention and not be greedy for small gains and eat meat that has not been inspected. At the same time, the bureau will formulate measures to strengthen inspections to ensure the health of citizens during this meat shortage.</p>
<p>Vegetables Often Have Water Added; Chicken Gizzards Have Cement</p>
<p>The supply of ordinary vegetables remains the same as before, but the price-controlled vegetables are all inferior goods and are often diluted with water and shortchanged. To buy better vegetables, citizens have been accustomed to paying black market prices, so the price-controlled signs in each vegetable market are equivalent to empty words. Chickens were once nowhere to be found, but recently a large number of chickens suddenly appeared in some vegetable markets. At first, citizens rushed to buy them. But after buying and slaughtering them, they found more than a catty of cement in the chicken gizzards, and it had hardened into a lump. It is rumored that this new method has not been invented for long. The root cause is that chicken vendors, restricted by price controls, had an innovative idea. One or two hours before selling, they mixed cement powder and water with bran, rubbed it into thin strips, and forcefully stuffed it into the chicken's head to increase its weight. These chickens die one or two hours after swallowing the cement powder, but citizens cannot detect it when weighing and buying.</p>
<p>The Office of the Supervising Commissioner is paying close attention to the practice of fish markets selling stinky fish along with good fish and will convene relevant personnel in the coming days to discuss a thorough rectification of the fish markets.</p>

<p>To prevent panic buying in the market and affect inventory, Qiu Liangrong, chairman of the Shanghai District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association, directors Li Tingdong and Zhou Weibai, and others paid a visit to Commissioner Jiang yesterday to make a request. Commissioner Jiang was out on official business, so Secretary Cai Baili met with them on his behalf. Qiu and Li reported the actual situation in the market in detail, saying that the current edible oil inventory totals 200,000 dan (approximately 10,000 tons), which is sufficient for five months based on the population of Shanghai. Furthermore, manufacturers jointly sold 3,000 dan in the market last Saturday, but it was all snatched up. The panic buying is even more intense today (the 4th). If a way to eradicate this is not found, the future is worrying. Secretary Cai accepted Qiu and Li's suggestion to cancel market transactions and adopt a direct allocation method, which will be handled by the Civil Affairs Commission. It will be implemented after being reported to Commissioner Jiang for approval.</p>

It was decided that fish market transactions will be directly negotiated between fish vendors and the fish market. Brokers can only buy and sell on behalf of customers and collect commissions and cannot wholesale. The detailed methods will be decided when the Social Affairs Bureau convenes a meeting. Furthermore, Tang Wujing and Le Jintang, two "yellow cattle" (scalpers) in the fish market who were arrested yesterday for sheltering fish cargo, have been released on bail after providing a written guarantee.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Commissioners Yu and Jiang held an important meeting yesterday morning, focusing on the expanded economic control meeting to be held on the 7th of this month.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Secretary Gao Liwen: Jiang Jingguo, for the convenience of the China Trust Bureau's handling, has voluntarily moved out of the enemy property at No. 2 Yicun a few days ago and moved to an apartment in the former French Concession. The former residence is planned to be returned to the enemy property office of the China Trust Bureau in the coming days.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Xuezhu, a young woman from Ningbo and niece of the late Shanghai tycoon Yu Qiaqing, went to the Central Bank at 11:00 a.m. yesterday to visit Jiang Jingguo, stating that she wanted to donate 11 taels and 8 liang of gold, which she received as inheritance. It happened that Jiang was out on official business, so Secretary Gao met with her on his behalf and promised to pass on her intention. However, the Office of the Supervising Commissioner later learned that there was a family dispute involved. Although this gold should nominally belong to Zheng, her custodian refused to hand it over. In anger, Zheng decided to donate it, believing that what private individuals cannot obtain, the state must have a way to obtain.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Finance and Economy on the Right Track: Deposits in Commercial Banks and Firms Increase Sharply, Reaching 240 Million Gold Yuan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to relevant sources: Since the currency reform, the economic and financial situation has gradually been getting on the right track. For example, the total number of commercial bank and firm deposits in Shanghai on August 19th was approximately equivalent to 6 million gold yuan, while the total value of deposits at the end of September has reached a staggering 240 million gold yuan, the speed of increase being extremely alarming. The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency has indeed increased the issuance of gold yuan, but on the other hand, the government is still working to contract the currency. For example, since the issuance of state-owned enterprise stocks, nearly 5 million gold yuan have been sold. The sale of materials and the issuance of short-term gold yuan treasury bills have also recovered the equivalent of 10 million U.S. dollars in currency, both of which are considerable amounts. At the same time, to strengthen the tightening of funds, the government may implement methods such as stock collateral and deposit deposits in the future. Therefore, although the currency issuance exceeds 900 million gold yuan, the floating funds in the market are not as large as imagined.</p>
<p>No Shortage of Major Materials</p>
<p>As for the inventory of industrial raw materials and daily necessities, it is particularly abundant. The panic buying in the market in the past two days is entirely due to a psychological illusion. Taking raw cotton as an example, American cotton can meet 60% of the demand. The remaining 40% is also guaranteed to be obtained if there are no transportation problems. The Central Bank recently plans to purchase 2.5 million dan of domestic cotton, so there is no shortage of raw cotton in Shanghai. Regarding flour, it has been decided to purchase wheat seeds from the United States instead of finished products so that Shanghai's flour mills can fully operate. According to statistics from the competent authorities, at the beginning of the victory, the cotton cloth inventory was only 2 million bolts, but now it has increased to 6.5 million bolts, which can supply the city for half a year. The current inventory of cotton yarn is 100,000 bales. In the past, 40,000 bales were consumed each month, but only 10,000 bales were consumed last month. Conservatively calculated, it can be maintained for at least three months. The inventory of edible oil is also very abundant, and the current inventory of sugar is 80,000 tons, while the national consumption is only 10,000 tons.</p>
<p>Optimistic Prospects for Rice and Coal Supply</p>
<p>As for the supply of staple food, rice, American rice and Taiwanese rice already account for 42% of the total demand, and the remainder can be purchased from nearby producing areas. According to current statistics, the rice inventory in Shanghai's rice shops is 270,000 zu (a unit of measurement), and there are still private stockpiles, but due to the scattered nature, it is difficult to count. In the future, Shanghai can transport surplus materials out to exchange for food from various places. In terms of coal, the source of power, the situation is also very optimistic. After the connection of the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou Railway, Pingxiang coal can be supplied in large quantities in the same way as Taiwanese coal and Kailuan coal, so there is no fear of a coal shortage in Shanghai. In summary, whether from a financial or material point of view, the future of Shanghai's economic management is very bright. It is hoped that citizens can maintain confidence and avoid unnecessary disturbances.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The economic control authorities, based on the materials registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, will launch a comprehensive inspection starting tomorrow, which is scheduled to be completed within two days. Police sub-bureaus, the Anti-Construction Brigade, and the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Team were ordered yesterday to actively prepare. It is estimated that the number of people mobilized at that time will be more than 5,000, divided into 1,634 groups, with Yu Shuping, director of the bureau, as the commander-in-chief.

The registered materials for this inspection include: (1) Rice, (2) Flour, (3) Cotton yarn, (4) Cotton cloth, (5) Edible oil, (6) Industrial raw materials, and (7) Paper. If discrepancies are found between the registered quantities or concealment or failure to report, the commander-in-chief will report to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervising Commissioner's Office for legal investigation.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xia Peide, an auditor of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was assigned in mid-July this year to inspect the Shanghai branch of Qichang Bank's large loan customers and the truth about the bank's overdue exchange on the 12th of the same month. However, Xia forged an investigation report and extorted four gold bars from Li Zijing, the manager of the bank. At the same time, he secretly talked with Wei Zhonghuai, the deputy manager of the bank, several times and had secret correspondence, which was suspected of colluding and engaging in malpractice. After the Gold Control Bureau discovered this, it transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. However, Xia and Wei both avoided appearing. The District Prosecutor's Office has now concluded its investigation of this case and has filed a public prosecution against the two defendants on charges of corruption.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Social Affairs Bureau to Discuss Prices of Imported Cigarettes Today <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the adjustment of the tobacco and alcohol tax, the new prices of cigarettes from various factories in the city have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, since imported cigarettes are not manufactured in Shanghai, no ex-factory tax is levied, so their prices are lower than the new prices of high-end cigarettes produced locally. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian believes that this will force the closure of various tobacco factories in the city. He consulted with Shi Shouzhang, director of the Commodity Tax Bureau, twice yesterday about this matter. According to Director Wu: Although the import of imported cigarettes is currently restricted, the Materials Supply Bureau has thousands of large boxes in stock, which is enough for the city for half a year. To save the city's tobacco factories, in principle, imported cigarettes will be allowed to increase in price. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a detailed discussion on this matter with the Commodity Tax Bureau and the Materials Supply Bureau this afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e88">This Month's Rice Allocation: Whole and Broken Rice Mixed; 15 Jin (Approximately 7.5 kg) for 9 Jiao 6 Fen; Allocation Begins on the 16th <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Commission recently stipulated that, starting in October, the poverty status of all those previously investigated and registered will be completely cancelled, and a new method will be determined to sell whole and broken rice mixed together. The mixing ratio is 80% whole rice and 20% broken rice, totaling 15 city jin (approximately 7.5 kg), priced at 9 jiao and 6 fen in gold yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the extremely cumbersome procedures for this month's rice allocation, it will not be possible to transport it in batches until mid-month, so the Civil Affairs Commission has decided that the above method will begin to be allocated starting on the 16th. However, between the 6th and the 15th, the commission will allocate 60,000 shi (a unit of measurement) of broken rice, with an allocation price of 5 jiao 3 fen 3 li per city dou (a unit of measurement).</p>

<p>The Standing Council and group leaders of the third council of the Newspaper Reporters Association of this city held their third regular meeting at the Shen Bao Weiqi Conference Room at 5:00 p.m. on the 4th. The chairman was Luo Dunwei.

(2) Deputy Chief of the Welfare Group Sun Daosheng reported: "According to the last meeting, we contacted the China Textile Company to allocate wool cloth to members. We have negotiated with Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing, who has assigned the Business Department to handle it. The method is that the company will cut samples and quote prices, which are particularly low, and then the number of orders will be certified by our association, and each newspaper will apply for purchase on its own." Next, important cases were discussed, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Li Zikuan, a member of the Newspaper Building Committee, applied to resign because he also served as a member of the Newspaper Building Committee of the Newspaper Association and could not take care of both. It was resolved to replace him with Supervisor Tang Shichang. (2) The Membership Qualification Review Committee appointed Fu Hou, Chief of the Organization Group, as the convener. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Sharp Increase in Cases of Shops Evading Taxes: Over 1,000 Cases Discovered in Ten Days <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Commodity Tax Bureau Strengthens Inspection Work</p>
<p>After the currency reform, from September 20th to the end of the same month, the Shanghai District Direct Tax Bureau discovered more than 1,700 cases of unpaid taxes in ten days, which were transferred to the District Court for separate fines and time-limited recovery. Before the currency reform, there were only over 100 cases per month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after receiving orders to increase taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, etc., Shi Shouzhang, director of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, in order to prevent tax evasion and increase tax revenue, specially convened a meeting of responsible persons from various sections and offices yesterday and decided to strengthen inspection work and strictly prevent tax evasion.</p>
<h3 id="e91">A Buying Frenzy Occurs in the Market Due to Unhealthy Psychological Factors; Chiang Ching-kuo Instructs Cadres to Have a High Degree of Political Awareness <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Ching-kuo, the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor, yesterday convened a meeting of the members of the Pacification and Construction Brigade and the Youth Service Corps to give instructions, encouraging them to have a high degree of political awareness and organizational concepts. He cited statistical figures, pointing out that in the past month and a half, Shanghai's market has undergone a qualitative change. Before "August 19th," the total deposits of Shanghai's commercial banks were 6.5 million gold yuan, while last week's total deposits exceeded 212 million gold yuan. This capital was previously used to speculate in the market, stirring up trouble. The elimination of market speculation indicates that the nature of the market has changed. However, in addition to eliminating speculation, active efforts should be made to increase production. He cited the city's largest cotton yarn and cigarette industries as examples, explaining that although these two industries are not mechanical industries, they have a solid foundation and scale in Shanghai's industrial sector. In order to maintain the workers' livelihoods and market stability, the government has taken measures to protect them, and there is absolutely no problem with the supply of raw materials.</p>
<p>The Fish Market Will Also Be Abolished</p>
<p>At this point, he instructed in a very frank tone that the goal we are pursuing today is a social revolution with profound historical significance. The basic requirements are, first, to reverse the previous phenomenon of the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer, and to ensure that the poor obtain a livelihood. Second, it is necessary to eliminate middlemen who exploit without labor. Third, it is necessary to ensure the producers' livelihood. In explaining these three goals, he stated firmly that after abolishing the cotton cloth market, the government would continue to abolish the fish market, making producers and consumers closer and closer, avoiding the heavy exploitation of middlemen and taking advantage of opportunities to stir up trouble, manipulate speculation, and harm people's livelihoods. He also believes that this action is revolutionary work and encouraged comrades to have a high degree of political literacy and organizational concepts to firmly implement it. Regarding the recent buying spree in the city, he believes that it is caused by unhealthy psychological factors of idlers, and he said that after the cigarette tax is increased, the government can increase its revenue by 34 million gold yuan per month.</p>
<p>No Shortage of Daily Necessities</p>
<p>As for daily necessities such as rice, oil, sugar, and coal, everything remains the same, and their reserves are sufficient. The oil supply can last for four months, the sugar reserves are 80,000 tons, enough for eight months, the cloth reserves are 6.2 million bolts, enough for the whole country for half a year, and the yarn reserves are 90,000 bales, so there is no fear of shortage. The reason why some people are worried all day long is that they lack combat training and experience, and they are used to a comfortable life, so they are panicked when they encounter changes. But according to the actual situation, there is no reason to panic. He also revealed that civil servants and workers in the city will be rationed salt, oil, rice, coal, sugar, and cloth starting from November 1st, and the preparation work can be completed within this month to ensure the producers' livelihoods. Finally, he warned his comrades that we have not yet encountered the real main force of the enemy, and we must be cautious to complete our sacred mission. He placed high hopes on the Youth Service Corps, saying that political training must be started to make them understand the purpose of the revolution and become loyal believers of the leader to engage in social reform.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Private Cars Are Still Allowed to Be Transferred; Oil Rationing for City Councilors Is Not Reduced <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The City Council passed the proposal to lift the restrictions on cars in the sixth general assembly. After the city government submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, it is now known that the Executive Yuan has approved it and still maintains the resolution of the third meeting of the thrift supervision committee, "The transfer is approved, but the transferee should be limited to those who are eligible to use cars according to the original regulations on restricting private use of cars," that is, registered banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises related to people's daily necessities, as well as registered doctors.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, the amount of oil allocated to cars owned by city councilors should also be reduced according to the central government's regulations, but because the situation in Shanghai is special and the city councilors are busy with meetings, the mayor has specially approved that the amount of oil allocated to them will not be reduced temporarily. The number of motorized bicycles will not be reduced for the time being, and the amount of oil allocated to them will still be maintained at eight gallons per month.</p>
<p>[Another News] In order to strictly enforce the conservation of gasoline for cars in this city, the Automobile Gasoline Conservation Review Committee has decided on interim measures. It is now known that car owners whose gasoline has been reduced can apply for adjustment of the oil allocation according to Article 4 of the original method. Before the end of October, they can purchase application forms from the Fourth Department of the Public Utilities Bureau and submit them to the Public Utilities Bureau for review by the Review Committee together with the documents to be submitted.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At about 10:54 a.m. yesterday, a three-story loft motor room of the Xieping Weaving Factory at No. 115, Lane 239 (that is, Tianheli), Ximen Road, caught fire due to excessive heat. Sparks entered the raw wool and cotton, causing a sudden fire. After receiving the report, the Fire Department immediately sent Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Detachment Commander Zhang Xuan, Section Chief Ye Binyong, and others to lead the pump truck to put out the fire. Subsequently, the Songshan Xinkaihe District Team Department and the West District Fire Brigade also rushed to assist with multiple belt trucks. However, the surrounding dangerous walls were towering, making it impossible to pour water. Although the firefighters and police climbed the ladder and looked down from a high position, they still could not extinguish the fire. In a short time, the adjacent Xiangyun Electrical Sock Factory at No. 114 was affected. Li Changsheng, the central district team commander, first climbed onto the dangerous wall and sprayed water remotely. All firefighters and police officers rushed into the flames to rescue regardless of their own safety. Unexpectedly, the wall bricks were loosened by the fire and collapsed immediately, injuring police officers Li Changsheng, Sun Lin, Qiu Dezhong, Wang Yuchu, Shen Guitang, Guo Dego, Wu Guoqiang, Zhou Jinzhong, Lu Qiliang, Ma Guojun, Zhu Bingyan, Xu Shigen, and Zhang Chaosheng. All thirteen were sent to the police hospital for treatment. The fire was extinguished at 1:40 p.m. It is reported that in addition to the complete destruction of the Xieping Factory, half of the Xiangyun Factory was also burned. After the incident, Xieping Factory Manager Huang Rongqing and Chief Accountant Ye Guoqing were summoned by the bureau to investigate the responsibility for the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Three Defendants Implicated in Qi Zaiyu's Case Await Judgment; Jin Runsheng Testified That He Had Contacted to Bail Wu Baokang; Jiang Shilin Tried to Deny Receiving Bribes and Was Allowed to Be Released on Bail <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jin Runsheng (also known as Jin Tuozi), Yu Shunhua, and Jiang Shilin, who were involved in the corruption case of Qi Zaiyu, the former head of the Sixth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, were transferred to the District Court for trial because they did not have military status. The preliminary hearing was held by Presiding Judge Zhu Yuhuang at 2:30 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Did Not Purchase Goods or Components</p>
<p>Jin Runsheng responded to the court's inquiry, stating: He did not hold any position in the Garrison Headquarters, nor was he a member of the Sixth Investigation Brigade. However, he had contacts with some personnel of the headquarters. He knew Qi Zaiyu's wife during the war, so he sometimes visited Qi's family. One day last winter, a relative of Wu Baokang, a Ding, visited him at home several times, saying that Wu was arrested by the Garrison Department and asked him to inquire about the reasons for the arrest. Later, he learned that Wu Baokang had been reported to have searched and purchased telephone equipment to aid the enemy during the war. After Wu was released on bail by him and Xue Jianshu, the cashier of the Sixth Investigation Brigade, Ding and Wu's accountant, Lu Ruqing, went to his house together and gave him a check for 20 million yuan from the City Bank to express their gratitude to him. The court then inquired about the conditions for Wu's bail. Jin said: Ding first contacted Qi directly, and finally decided to pay 455 million yuan, which was not negotiated by him.</p>
<p>Borrowed Tables and Chairs</p>
<p>Next, the first defendant, Yu Shunhua, testified: He did not hold a position in the Sixth Investigation Brigade. Because the Garrison Department held a memorial service for Mr. Dai (referring to Dai Li), he borrowed tables and chairs on behalf of the department and purchased firewood for the team. When he went to the team, he met Chen Zengxiang, whom he did not know, at the door and asked how to report and the benefits of reporting. He replied that he did not know. Later, Chen Wenyi and Zhou Wenda, who handled the case (Chen and Zhou were previously sentenced to five years in prison by the Garrison Department and are now in custody), invited him and four or five others in military uniforms to arrest Wu. As for whether there was a formal arrest warrant for Wu's arrest and where Wu was detained, he did not know anything because he was illiterate. Later, Xue Jianshu sent him 5 million yuan as a reward for borrowing tables and chairs.</p>
<p>Responding with Six Reasons</p>
<p>Finally, Jiang Shilin, Qi's private secretary, replied: He did not have any title in the Investigation Brigade, and only assisted Qi in the capacity of a private secretary. He met Jin and Yu at the team or at Qi's house, but he was not familiar with them. He did not know anything about the case of Wu Baokang's report. Although he knew Xue Jianshu, the cashier of the team, he did not know that he had negotiated to send bribes because of Wu's case. He himself did not receive any bribes. After the confession, he claimed that according to Article 96 of the Criminal Law, he requested to respond with several points to explain that he was not related to Wu's case: (1) He was not an accomplice in Wu's case, and his name was not on the bribery list and check stub. (2) Wu's case was a conspiracy by a certain group of people. (3) After Qi Zaiyu's case occurred, the defendants' confessions did not involve him at all. (4) Qi's confession in the Garrison Department did not say that he had received money. (5) The recovery of bribes had nothing to do with him. He repeated the above-mentioned second point of conspiracy and framed him one by one, and was then stopped by the court. Later, witnesses Wu Baokang (currently detained in the Special Criminal Court), Lu Ruqing, and Xue Jianshu were summoned, but none of them appeared in court. After the lawyers of each defendant debated one after another, the judgment was scheduled to be pronounced at 4:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month. Jiang Shilin was granted bail pending summons, and Jin and Yu were returned to custody.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Special Criminal Court yesterday sentenced a starvation case. This is the first judgment in the court's trial of the labor tide case. The defendants are Wang Kun, the director of the dyeing and finishing department of the Taishi Zhenfeng Woolen Factory, and Wang Yihua, a worker in the factory. The main text of the judgment is: "Wang Kun and Wang Yihua jointly violated the National General Mobilization Order prohibiting obstruction of production and were each sentenced to two years in prison and deprived of civil rights for two years." The facts of the case: Wang was introduced to work in the Zhenfeng Woolen Factory in the 33rd year of the Republic. Wang then introduced Wang Yihua to work in the factory. Wang was active and Wang's personality was also stubborn. Wang ran a reading club in the factory and served as a teacher, so he had a good relationship with the workers. In December last year, a dispute occurred because the workers asked the factory for year-end bonuses. The workers elected Wang and Wang as representatives. The factory did not grant the workers' request, and the workers starved for three days. The factory reported to the police bureau because it suffered heavy losses. Because Wang and Wang were suspected of inciting a labor tide, the police bureau transferred the case to the Special Court for trial after the Special Court was established, and the judgment was made yesterday.</p>

This was reported by Lu Lijie, an employee of the district office. After investigation, Ye and others admitted, but said, "Other districts also have interest distribution. At the request of colleagues in the office, we distributed it first and reported it to the Civil Affairs Bureau at the same time." The District Attorney's Office filed a public prosecution against Ye and others on suspicion of corruption. The District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon. Except for Zhang Shijun and Ding Fenghang, who were on the run, Ye and others appeared in court and claimed that this behavior was to seek employee welfare and was definitely not corruption. After summoning witnesses Tian Hong and Wang Zhifu, the judgment was scheduled for the 8th.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] At about 8:35 p.m. the night before last, someone was found moving on the roof of No. 240 to No. 246 Huashan Road in Shanghai West. After someone ran to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, police officer Luo Kaiman of No. 558 climbed the sunbathing platform and saw a dark shadow on the ridge of the roof. He ordered him to get off the roof, but the other party threw tiles and stones. The police officer was afraid that it was a thief, so he fired a shot into the sky as a warning. Unexpectedly, someone immediately fell down, and it was a woman over forty years old who died from a broken jaw. A paper for applying for a national identity card from the 31st District (that is, Gaoqiao District), named Yu Guo Xiuying, was found beside her. Afterwards, Yu Ding, the criminal section chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, led the police to investigate. According to He Yuying, a maid in the house, she witnessed the deceased entering from the back door of No. 240 Huashan Road at about 5:00 p.m. Because there were five or six households in the house and she was familiar with the door, she did not suspect anything else and did not question her. At dusk, she heard footsteps on the roof of the neighboring house. According to residents Chen Weixin and others, they heard noises on the roof at about 8:00 p.m., so they went up to the sunbathing platform and saw a dark shadow. They called out but there was no response. When they approached, they threw bricks and stones, so they called the police. Director Yu then detained the police officer. By the next morning, after the District Attorney's Office sent personnel to inspect, it was found that there were no bullet marks, and it was determined that he died from falling injuries. Subsequently, according to the receipt for the identity card application, personnel were sent to the 31st District to investigate. According to the neighbors on the left and right sides of Huashan Road, they did not know him, or he was suffering from mental illness. As for the police officer firing the gun, the examination was in line with the implementation regulations, and there was no improper behavior. He has been released first and is waiting for the superiors to review the case.</p>

<h3 id="e104">A Conversation with Mr. Chen Gongqia: A New Outline for the Construction of Zhejiang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 2nd] Mr. Chen Gongqia has been in charge of Zhejiang Province for three months. In these three months, he has implemented public document reforms, adopted layered responsibility, and public documents do not necessarily have to be approved by the主管 (responsible) officials. He has also abolished armed guards, completely using plainclothes police to guard the gates of the provincial government. He has also set up an inquiry office, staffed by an anonymous staff member to answer questions. In addition, he has replaced and transferred many county magistrates. In these actions, we cannot say that he does not have a new style, but we cannot help but say that he seems too trivial. Because today's Zhejiang is also a microcosm of the country, and there is only one problem, that is, the economic situation needs to be improved urgently. For this reason, the reporter had a long conversation with Mr. Chen Gongqia in his office. He admitted that the current problem is the economy, but improving the economy is easier said than done. "Now he started by sorting out the finances. The past accounts were inevitably a bit vague." He said, "After the finances of Hangzhou City were sorted out, they were much better. The provincial finances must also be sorted out. However, the capital of the Provincial Bank is only 50,000 gold yuan. How can such a bank, which controls the finances of the whole province and circulates the economic blood of the whole province, handle emerging businesses with such a small amount of funds?" According to his intention, the capital of the Provincial Bank should be increased to 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Spend More Money to Nurture Zhejiang</p>
<p>There are many things he wants to do. He used to be able to issue角分票 (small denomination banknotes) in the Fujian Provincial Bank, which could circulate a lot of funds. Of course, this is impossible now. Therefore, he wants to use the resources of Zhejiang Province, regulate the circulation of resources, and use the trade income from foreign trade to revitalize the industry of Zhejiang Province. For this reason, he has specially established a Materials Utilization Committee. This committee does not belong to the Construction Department, but is directly under the provincial government. It is said that there are no funds, and he has to spend more money to nurture Zhejiang after making ends meet. The first step is to regulate and utilize green ramie, and the second step is to actively improve cotton planting and regulate the more than 2 million mu of cotton fields in Yuyao and the more than 1 million mu of cotton fields in Zhenhai. If the utilization of resources can be successful, then according to Mr. Chen Gongqia, Zhejiang has unlimited prospects.</p>
<p>Planning to Build Two Light Railways</p>
<p>Another plan of Mr. Chen Gongqia is to build light railways and establish a light railway preparatory office. According to him, gasoline will be more expensive in the future, and the parts of cars almost all rely on foreign countries. We can lay light steel rails on the highways, which can recover a lot of foreign exchange for the country and produce more efficiency than automobile transportation. If you think the light railway is not good, you only need to dismantle it, and it is still a good highway." He plans to build two light railways first: one is from Shaoxing Baiguan, from Baiguan to Zhenhai; the other is from Cao'e to Tiantai, Tiantai to Haimen in Linhai. In his view, these two railways increase Zhejiang's two exports, which can sell many local products to the outside, and at the same time, many things from the outside can also be transported in.</p>
<p>Develop Water Conservancy in Oujiang and Lingjiang Rivers</p>
<p>Regarding farmland water conservancy, his idea is that since it is not easy to succeed in Yongli Power Generation in Jiekou for a while, Oujiang and Lingjiang Rivers can also find ways to generate hydropower, which can probably have 10,000 kilowatts. He affirmed: If hydropower generation cannot be used, then the motivating power is lacking, and without the motivating power, there is no way for the countryside to progress. Therefore, in his plan, the water conservancy projects of Oujiang and Lingjiang Rivers must be done, but to do them, a huge amount of funds is required.</p>
<p>Actively Establish Farmers' Schools</p>
<p>He is now going to run a farmers' school. This school does not belong to the Education Department, but is directly under the provincial government. His ideal is to instill new knowledge and technology to farmers. First, set up a farmers' school preparatory committee, and regularly recruit teachers from classes A and B for training. Class A must be graduates from the agricultural college of the university, and class B must be high school graduates who serve in the cultural and educational circles. According to Mr. Chen Gongqia, the ideal of this school is to recruit a group of excellent and young farmers to enroll. After enrollment, they will be given three mu of land and asked to cultivate it according to what the teachers have taught. After graduation, the land will still be cultivated by him, and the harvest will also be at his disposal. In this way, the number of people who enroll will greatly increase, and new agricultural knowledge and technology will also deeply penetrate the countryside. The land policy has also been implemented a lot. He decided that the principal must be a university graduate, and the principal must lead by example and operate like the students.</p>
<p>Use Minerals to Exchange for Materials</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of industry, the alum mines in Pingyang, the copper mines in Qingtian, and the antimony mines in Wuyi, of which copper and antimony are the main raw materials for steelmaking, and alum is an important raw material for all refined steel products. He is now planning to use these many minerals to exchange for what Zhejiang needs.</p>
<p>The reporter asked him if he would go on inspection tours? Do you want to convene the heads of various counties to hold a review and planning of the work? His answer was: "I don't want to go on inspection tours, because even if you repeatedly order the local government not to entertain you, the local government is always prepared, which will inevitably waste money and manpower. For the time being, we will not hold meetings, as long as the agency is flexible, it can be as easy as pointing fingers."</p>
<p>Carefully Observe and Diligently Move Forward</p>
<p>After this conversation, I felt that Mr. Chen Gongqia's outline for the construction of Zhejiang was indeed carved very brilliantly. However, Chinese people often rely on seven parts of personnel affairs and three parts of handling affairs. Just in terms of regulating and utilizing resources, will it affect the interests of some powerful people in the local area? I am afraid that it cannot be completely said that it will not. Then, what method will Mr. Chen Gongqia adopt to deal with this problem when he faces this problem? This seems to be worth asking. We are eagerly hoping that this new outline drawn by Mr. Chen for Zhejiang can be realized as scheduled. We are even more eagerly hoping that Mr. Chen will lead the civil servants of the province, without fear or discouragement, to carefully observe and diligently move towards the goals!</p>
<h3 id="e105">Stagnation of Fresh Meat Industry in Various Regions: Changshu Butchers Close Doors; Jinshan Raises Fresh Pork Prices <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Correspondent, 3rd] The fresh meat industry here is in complete shutdown due to the discontinuation of hog supply on the 3rd. A petition has been submitted to relevant authorities for relief. It is understood that in previous years, hog vendors procured hogs from Nantong and other places in northern Jiangsu to supply Changshu. However, since the Jiangkou blockade, they have disappeared. Moreover, farmers in the countryside are unwilling to sell hogs at low prices, which is the main reason for the shutdown.</p>
<p>[Our Jinshan Correspondent, 2nd] In recent days, Shanghai hog vendors have been buying live hogs at high prices in Jinshan County. This has led to most breeders being unwilling to comply with the "August 19th" price limit and sell to local butchers, resulting in a lack of meat on the market. In addition to urgently telegraphing the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the pig industry association to purchase live hogs at the August 19th price limit of 26.70 Gold Yuan per dan (unit of weight), the County Government has issued public notices to all townships, forbidding both buyers and sellers from raising market prices, with violators being arrested and punished.</p>

<p>Public Outrage Incites Telegram to Garrison Headquarters for Handling</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 3rd] The deadline for the second conscription phase of this year has passed, with only 40% of the new recruits being accepted after inspection. Magistrate Xu has requested punishment for himself. This is due to excessively strict conscription standards.</p>
<p>[Further News] Zhong Jie, the 7th Company Commander of the 3rd Receiving Battalion, assaulted Xu Shouli, the township head of Changyin Township, while inspecting new recruits on the afternoon of the 2nd, leading to a dispute. It is understood that Township Head Xu faced difficulties in conscription, managing to recruit only one person, who was then rejected due to being mentally dull and inarticulate. Xu had a verbal altercation with Company Commander Zhong, resulting in being slapped several times and kicked. This incited outrage among the township heads of demobilized soldiers, who reported the matter to Magistrate Xu and telegraphed the garrison headquarters about the incident, awaiting their handling.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Guilin Nickel Rush: Wu Guangming Makes a "Currency Reform" Fortune; Supervisor Liao Goes to Central Bank to Investigate <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>[Our Guilin Correspondent, 29th] The case of Wu Guangming, manager of the Guilin branch of the Central Bank, making a "currency reform" fortune and using his position to profit by hundreds of billions of yuan or more, has caused a sensation throughout Guilin.</p>
<p>Provincial Supervisor Liao Ge-min personally went to the Central Bank on the 28th of last month to investigate, and discovered many suspicious points: (1) The order from the head office to issue nickel coins was received on August 21st, but the Central Bank did not make it public, delaying until August 28th to draft a news release for newspapers. (2) The Central Bank delayed the redemption of nickel coins until September 4th to begin. (3) The Central Bank claimed that "the telegram from the head office did not specify whether the nickel coins to be issued were nickel coins previously issued by the Central Bank, or newly issued copper-nickel coins, so we dared not redeem them without authorization." However, the fact is that from August 21st to 28th, the bank neither announced the circulation of nickel coins nor telegraphed the head office for instructions. (4) On the 23rd, the Central Bank converted 19,000 yuan of nickel coins into Gold Yuan and recorded it in the account. Where did this huge amount of nickel coins come from? Supervisor Liao has now decided to first impeach Wu Guangming for dereliction of duty to the Control Yuan. Liao is actively investigating Wu's abuse of power and embezzlement. After this incident occurred, the Municipal Senate and the District Court paid close attention and were collecting evidence for this case in preparation for filing an indictment.</p>

<p>[Our Tainan Correspondent, 1st by Airmail] Liu Shaobin, 22 years old, from Shenyang, an employee of the Xinxing branch of the Provincial Bureau of Commodity Inspection, came to Taiwan last September. He was living in the home of his friend, Wang Kezhuang. Yesterday, taking advantage of Wang Kezhuang's absence, he suddenly had a thieving impulse, stealing gold ingots and hundreds of taels of jewelry, as well as dozens of strings of pearl and diamond rings, all stored in Wang's safe. The next day, he boarded the Haiqian ship to Shanghai, possibly heading to Peiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other ports. Wang Kezhuang is currently reporting the case to the police for investigation and apprehension.</p>

<p>[Our Wuxing Correspondent, 2nd] The Special Commissioner ordered the Wuxing County Government to hold a sale of rice at subsidized prices two months ago, but it has not been carried out. Now, the People's Food Adjustment Committee convened a meeting on the 2nd and decided to distribute the remaining 113,200 catties of white rice to 61 townships at an average subsidized price, based on the original cost as the standard. The township heads are required to collect the rice within four days and sell it at subsidized prices immediately to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>[Further News] For this year's land tax, the central government stipulated a levy of one and a loan of one. The provincial government added an additional 1.2 dou (unit of volume) for pacification expenses. All county senators, considering the inability of farmers to bear the burden, jointly elected Speaker Ling to go to the capital with representatives from other county senates to petition for a reduction. Recently, definite information was received that the Executive Yuan disapproved of the levy for pacification expenses. However, the land tax levy of one and a loan of one is currently under negotiation for reduction.</p>

<p>[Our Yin County Correspondent, 4th by Telegraph] Hu Chaojun from Yin County went to Zhenhai Jiangnan yesterday for business. While passing by the Xin Xin Bridge in Zhutian Ocean, he suddenly heard strange noises under the bridge. Hu, curious, leaned down to look and saw a large group of turtles floating on the water, raising their heads and moving forward with effort. They varied in size, the larger ones being like bowls and the smaller ones like shrimp, mostly black with some yellow. There were countless turtles, occupying about 9 meters in width and 4 meters in depth of the river surface. Wanting to know where they were going, Hu followed them for over half a li (unit of distance), nearing the Zhangjia Bridge near the foot of the mountain. Suddenly, the turtles dived into the riverbed and disappeared. Only then did he realize it was turtles moving house. Farmers in the fields spread the word, causing a stir.</p>

<p>[Our Wujin Correspondent, 1st] Yang Xinglin, 40 years old, a fishmonger residing in Jinjia Village, about three or four li from the south of the city, runs the Zhengxie Xing Fish Shop in Chen Du Bridge, a small town in Nanmen. Over the years, he has managed the shop well and is quite wealthy. He has one wife and one concubine, living separately. His wife, Zhou, lives in Jinjia Village in the countryside and cultivates dozens of acres of good land, hiring Ge Shunfu from the same village as a long-term worker. Yang is frequently away from home due to the fish shop, and over time, a relationship developed between the master and servant. At midnight one day at the end of May this year, Ge threw a brick at the roof of Zhou's bedroom. Zhou woke up, got out of bed, lit a lamp, and went out to investigate, when Ge grabbed her and raped her. Recently, Ge asked Zhou to meet him at a hotel near the train station, threatening her to elope with him. Zhou strongly refused, and it did not happen. Ge held a grudge and approached Lin Yueqing, Li Deliang, Li Changfa, and Song Jinyuan from Shangbei Min, offering white rice worth five shi (unit of volume), paying 48 Gold Yuan upfront, and conspiring to murder Zhou's husband, Yang Xinglin. On the night of the 28th of last month, he hid in the Hongbin Hotel on Carpenter Street, Nanmen. At dawn the next morning, Ge directed Li Deliang and others to follow Yang to a remote place in Diba Tou, where they grabbed Yang and stabbed him twelve times in the head and chest with a sharp blade, causing Yang to fall to the ground immediately. Assuming that he was dead, the culprits abandoned the knife and snatched a travel bag left by Yang. Later, Yang was found by a colleague passing by, who rushed him to the hospital for treatment. The local criminal police team received the news and launched an investigation, taking Ge into custody that night for questioning. In less than half a day, the whole case was clear. They used swift and decisive means to apprehend each culprit at their respective addresses one by one. After questioning, they all confessed without hesitation and have now been handed over to the local court for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>[News from Our Agency] Regarding the issue of capital increase for local banks and money shops, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the regulations and procedures for capital increase, the local banks, money shops and trust companies have listed more than ten articles of the regulations and requested amendments and interpretations. They submitted these to the Financial Management Bureau, which forwarded them to the Ministry of Finance for reference in re-drafting the detailed rules for capital increase. These detailed rules have not yet been promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the regulations for capital increase, announced on September 6, originally stipulated that the capital increase should be completed within two months of the announcement. Considering the current situation, the time limit is clearly insufficient. Therefore, the industry association recently jointly submitted a request to the Financial Management Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the deadline for capital increase be changed to within three months after the announcement of the detailed rules for capital increase.</p>
<p>According to Director Lin of the Financial Management Bureau, as far as he knows, the capital increase regulations only apply to Chinese banks and money shops. Because the situation for foreign merchants is slightly different, it will be handled separately.</p>

<p>The rice supply is decreasing, and transactions are scarce. A small amount of Jiangxi unpolished Indica rice and Zhonghuo machine-milled late rice are available in the Nanshi market. The former is priced at 17 yuan, and the latter at 18.70 yuan, both for immediate purchase, with approximately 600 dan available. Other Japonica and Indica rice lack transactions. There are few transactions in the Beishi market, and no rice samples are seen in the market, making the situation very bleak. Yesterday's arrivals were 960 dan in Nanshi and 238 dan in Beishi.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Transactions are still suspended from the market. The market is sluggish, and the number of dealers in the market has decreased. However, factory-allocated flour is still distributed as usual.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Transactions are dismal. The supply of soybeans is extremely low. Even if there are samples for sale, they are quickly bought up by the local dealers. Meigong and Poyangzi are both available, but supply cannot meet demand. Corn and Yuanmai are not available. Several dozen packages of red beans were traded at a price of 10 yuan. Green beans and broad beans are not available at all. Sesame transactions are still numerous, making it the only one with normal transactions among miscellaneous grains. There is Nanjing Xinsheng Ren available, priced at 34 yuan.</p>

<p>With the rice supply gradually decreasing, Economic Supervisor Zeng ordered Wan Nonglin, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, to be responsible for expanding the sources of supply. Wan specifically convened representatives of rice merchants and Dong Jiufeng, the chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, at the Rice Industry Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter of exchanging cloth for rice. In recent times, farmers in various producing areas have been unwilling to sell their rice because grain prices have not risen. If cloth is exchanged for rice, farmers can be expected to sell their hoarded rice. The two sides exchanged opinions and discussed the matter in detail. According to Dong, the cotton cloth industry has been facing many difficulties recently, and the production of cotton cloth cannot be freely bought and sold. Some of it has been shipped to other ports, and some needs to be allocated to cloth shops. Exchanging cloth for rice may not be possible, so the meeting ended without results.</p>

<p>The sugar market yesterday stopped rising and turned to decline, and the market sentiment was already weak. The trend was slightly flat. Because of the continuous rise in the previous week, retail investors were worried about changes at high levels, and the association authorities also followed the supervisor's instructions to try to suppress prices. Therefore, there were many supplies on the market yesterday, and the interest of various groups was also weak. The market situation slightly declined by two or three jiao.</p>

<p>[News from Our Agency] Recently, tea industry insiders told reporters that Qimen black tea, which has always been popular in the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, is a major product, but in recent years, trade with the Soviet Union has been conducted by our government through barter trade. Therefore, at present, exporters in this city only have the United Kingdom as their destination. It is reported that the overseas market is extremely fond of this variety, but the inventory is almost exhausted, and the transactions are extremely narrow, making the situation very good. As for Tunlv and other green teas for export, French North Africa has repeatedly inquired, but holders insist on selling firmly because both production and inventory are scarce, and the process is extremely quiet. As for red and green teas for domestic sales, there are continued additions from this street and various places in Su Xi Chang, and the potential is still active. In terms of prices, they are in balance and not differentiated.</p>

<p>[News from Our Agency] The National Cotton Textile Federation held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Director Du Yuesheng. More than 50 directors and supervisors, including Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, and Pan Yangshan, attended. Important cases were resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Based on the proposal of the cotton spinning associations in the Su Zhe Wan Jing Hu area, requesting the government to take charge of raw cotton, in order to stabilize the price of joint purchase under a comprehensive supply plan and to ensure sufficient supply of domestic cotton, it was agreed to consider the national procurement plan of the competent authorities and the National Cotton Joint Procurement Association, and all factories should abandon self-purchase of domestic cotton. After discussion, all representatives unanimously agreed and requested the Joint Procurement Committee to quickly pass the implementation, and set up joint procurement branches in major domestic cotton producing and distributing centers to facilitate comprehensive purchase.</p>
<p>(2) In addition, the Joint Procurement Committee requested the government to strictly crack down on the adulteration of cotton and the purchase of cotton by people outside the industry. It is hoped that the authorities will issue orders to the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties to strictly implement this. Regarding cotton merchants' flower collection, it is hoped that there will be no large storage quantities. If there is any suspicion of hoarding, it will also be cracked down on. The Textile Federation therefore decided to recommend that the Joint Procurement Committee accept the leaders it dispatched to various places to participate in the joint work. The candidates are: Shi Fengxiang in Xi'an, Pan Yangchu in Chongqing, Li Guowei in Hankou, and Yang Yizhou in Tianjin.</p>
<p>(3) Suggest that the Joint Procurement Committee increase the funding for joint purchase of domestic cotton to match the comprehensive purchase plan</p>
<p>(4) It was decided to convene the third annual meeting of the association on the 8th of next month.</p>
<p>Discussing Distribution Technology Issues</p>
<p>[News from Our Agency] Since the management authorities suspended the transaction of yarn and cloth in the market, the Social Bureau scheduled to convene representatives from the yarn and cloth market, the Yarn and Cloth Industry Association, the Textile Construction Company, the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, and the replication industry tomorrow afternoon to hold a meeting to discuss technical issues related to the direct distribution of yarn and cloth. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company continued to distribute yarn to the replication industry, distributing 601 pieces to 378 households, equivalent to 1,291 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Unified Tax Will Not Be Adjusted</p>
<p>After the increase in tobacco tax, the market has been greatly affected. It is generally said that the unified tax on cotton yarn will also be adjusted. According to a responsible person from the Goods Tax Bureau, regarding goods tax revenue, cotton yarn accounts for the largest proportion other than tobacco and alcohol. However, tobacco and alcohol are non-essential items and have luxury components. The government has recently called for frugality and national construction, so it is natural to tax luxury goods. This levy is both prohibitive and can increase government revenue without affecting the welfare of most people. Cotton yarn is a necessity for people's livelihood and is of great importance. The government would rather reduce treasury revenue and does not want to adjust this tax rate.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn and cloth market was ordered to stop trading. Chairman Tang of the industry association met with Supervisor Jiang yesterday to ask about the survival of yarn merchants after the market was closed and the supply and sales of cotton yarn for all members of the association in the future. The staff in the market gathered as usual, waiting for the authorities to decide, without doing any buying and selling.</p>
<p>The Textile Construction Company routinely distributed cotton yarn to manufacturers, listing 40-count three-ply Baoguang at a price of 1,030 yuan, 42-count double-ply Lima Jianxian at 990 yuan, 40-count T.K. Sunlight cone yarn at 1,150 yuan, and 32-count, 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, and 6-count coarse and fine yarns, a total of nine types. The transactions were mediocre.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was also verbally instructed by Supervisor Jiang that in order to coordinate the supply of cotton cloth and prevent repeated purchases, so as to stimulate market prices, the cotton cloth market should immediately stop the market. Therefore, there were no transactions in the market. Only the same industry members were handling the distribution of the dyeing and weaving industry association. In addition, the supply of cotton cloth to retailers and wholesalers is distributed by private yarn factories and the Textile Construction Company, and the allocated prices of each cloth are based on the "August 19" price limit. The first batch of cloth distributed to dyeing and weaving factories includes 62 types such as fine cloth, coarse and fine twill drill, and plain yarn drill, plain cloth white cloth, coarse cloth, etc., totaling 18,530 bolts, and members of the Cotton Cloth Association can take part in the distribution.</p>
<p>Further News: The Cotton Cloth Association will handle the second phase of distribution to the Dyeing and Weaving Association. The distribution procedures and time are as follows: Announce the cloth to be distributed and display samples at 11:00 AM. Collect purchase orders from 1:00 to 3:00 PM. Purchase orders will not be accepted after the deadline. Draw the lots for purchase permission the next day from 1:00 to 2:00 PM. (Purchasers should gather at 1:00). Issue purchase permits from 2:30 to 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Further News: Yesterday, the business of various door-front cloth shops was thriving, with Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan drill being the most brilliant. There were some restrictions on purchases, with each person being limited to buying 1.5 zhang (unit of length) with an ID card, or each cloth industry member being limited to buying 1 pi (unit of length) with a membership card. Some cloth shops temporarily supplied, so the market situation was quite uneven.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Chairman Dong of the Cloth Industry Association suggested to the Supervisor's Office that door-front cloth shops should limit each Shanghai citizen to purchase 6 yards (unit of length) with an ID card, and wholesale shops should wholesale to retail shops with membership cards, one piece per shop. Foreign merchants and people will be refused to purchase at all.</p>

<p>The rayon market is still extremely tight, and various types are still in high demand with no supply. The silk weaving industry in this street can be supported because of the allocation.

<h3 id="e125">Rising Prices at Production Sites and Impact of War: Export Goods Show Signs of Depletion <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information from the Export Control Committee, Shanghai's inventory this week (September 27 to October 3) shows signs of depletion due to rising prices of export goods at production sites and the impact of the war in some areas. Approximately 7,000 tons of tung oil arrived in September, mostly purchased privately from the interior. Foreign demand remains strong, with the New York market price still at US$0.21 per pound. Although transactions are possible, trade is not vigorous. According to the United States Information Service, the Economic Cooperation Administration has reportedly approved the purchase of a large quantity of tung oil in China. Hog bristles from Sichuan, Tianjin, and Hankou are still rising in price, leading to scattered transactions. Exports are mostly pre-sold goods. Foreign prices are stable, with Shanghai No. 17 F.O.B. at US$2.45 per pound. Based on current domestic and foreign market prices, transactions are still possible. Foreign demand for tea is quite strong. In addition to the United Kingdom and North Africa, sales in South Africa should not be underestimated. However, the dwindling inventory in foreign tea markets has further caused sellers to hold firm, and trade is becoming increasingly weak. The raw silk market is fluctuating. D-grade silk F.O.B. is priced at US$2.80 per pound, which is exportable, but no business has been conducted yet. Sales of silk fabrics abroad are gradually developing, and market prices are also improving. For example, 45" heavy crepe and 45" "Da Wei Ni" from Sodium America are priced at C.I.F. US$1.50 and US$2.20 per yard, respectively. 27" "Liu Xiang" crepe (interwoven fabric) and 45" crepe satin sold to India are priced at 4 rupees 11 anna and 7 rupees 12 anna per yard C.T.F. in Indian currency, respectively. Goose feathers and duck feathers are also showing promise in the foreign market. Their F.O.B. prices per pound are US$0.50 and US$0.40, respectively, slightly higher than last week. In addition, exports of other items such as sausage casings, soybeans, and sesame seeds are also possible.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] In order to improve middle schools and raise standards, the Ministry of Education ordered various departments to select one excellent male and female public school under their jurisdiction and submit them to the Ministry for assistance in further development and demonstration.

<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 4th] Hu Shi, President of Peking University, and Li Ji, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum, gave academic lectures at Wuhan University today. Hu's topic was "Two Cultures in Two Worlds," stating that there is a fundamental principle in history and culture: survival of the fittest, accepting the excellent and discarding the inferior. For thousands of years, there was one world and one cultural tradition. Modern culture can be divided into three categories: (1) science for human happiness, (2) political democratization, and (3) economic socialization, which are accepted by the world. In the past thirty years, some self-proclaimed visionaries have implemented thorough reforms, used their intelligence, and worshiped dictatorship, forcibly dividing the world into two worlds and two cultures, leading to the existence of the Iron Curtain today. However, this is a measure that violates freedom and human nature. Seeing its oppression of the people, cutting off external communication, and feeling empty, it will eventually fail, and mankind will be restored from two cultures in two worlds to one culture in one world, re-accepting political democratization and economic socialization. It is also learned that another task of Hu's trip is to collect reference materials related to the Water Classic Commentary left by the sages Yang Shoujing and Xiong Huizhen of Hubei Province, in order to help him complete the textual research of the Water Classic Commentary.</p>

<p>St. John's and Jingwu Compete for Final Spot</p>
<p>The Victory Cup Volleyball Tournament organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association has entered the final stage. The atmosphere has been tense in the association's gymnasium on Sichuan Road in recent days. Yesterday, both matches were played as best-of-five. In the first match, the Tiemajun (Iron Horse Army) lost the qualifying match. The Tiemajun had more balanced personnel, and their skills and experience were better than the Xiangjun, so they won the qualifying match three to one. In the second match, Yongyi beat Watson's to win the championship match. Yongyi is the champion of Jingwu Cup Group B, and Watson's had previously followed closely behind with very close scores. Last night's battle was truly a clash of titans. Yongyi was aided by Ma Canxi and Guo Linjian, which was like adding wings to a tiger. Watson's lost again by three to zero. Yongyi won the final match. The results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tiemajun 13-21 21-12 21-16 21-18 Xiangjun</p>
<p>Yongyi 21-15 23-21 21-18 Watson's</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 PM today, the championship match between St. John's and Jingwu will still be held in the association's gymnasium on Hengbang Bridge. Another match will be a qualifying match. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenhua vs. Fanxing 6:00 PM</p>
<p>St. John's vs. Jingwu 7:00 PM</p>
<p>In the second match of the championship, St. John's will face Jingwu. Jingwu defeated Mobil in the semi-finals, proving that the team is at its peak. Qi Yongfu and Li Zhen'an serve as the backbone of the first and second rows. Li is known for his powerful attacks and strategic play. The Chen brothers are skilled at high spikes. Weng Chengguang's dropshots and Qian Jiaxiang's quick attacks from St. John's are fatal blows to Jingwu. However, if St. John's wants to win the championship match, they must fight hard with all their strength, so the competition will be fierce.</p>
<p>In the first qualifying match, Zhenhua usually plays with seven players. In the match against Jixian three days ago, the seven players were full of vitality, making Jixian at a loss. Captain Xu Mouliang performed brilliantly. It is often said that Zhenhua playing with seven players can beat nine players, but it is unclear why. Winning against Fanxing today is expected. The order today must not be changed. Please pay attention to the four teams.</p>

<h3 id="e148">On Chinese Cuisine <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Zhi</p>
<p>Of all the manifestations of Chinese culture, one that is truly a source of pride and universally acknowledged is probably the art of cooking. Everyone says this, but upon closer reflection, even cooking is showing a trend toward decline; at the very least, it requires effort to maintain this reputation.</p>
<p>Chinese cuisine possesses a consistent artistic and philosophical significance, historically aligned with poetry, calligraphy, painting, landscape, and gardens, all mutually interconnected. The most crucial principle is that each dish or set of dishes must maintain its unique character, just like writing poetry. If a poem is half in the style of the Han and Wei dynasties and half in the style of the late Tang dynasty, or if it could be attributed to either person A or person B, then it is not a remarkable poem worth passing down or enjoying.</p>
<p>In recent times, the schools and styles of cooking are generally divided into Huaiyang, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, and Sichuan. This is not to say that there are no other good cuisines, but these are the readily discernible sectarian distinctions, universally acknowledged, just as the Four Wangs differ from Shi Xi and Shi Tao, with completely different appearances, impossible to forcibly equate. In major cities, you can experience whichever cuisine you prefer by visiting the corresponding restaurant. Before about 1931, famous restaurants mostly maintained their traditional styles. Some highly conservative establishments even only offered a few fixed dishes, making you feel that they were perfectly executed. In the last dozen years or so, the atmosphere has gradually changed. Every restaurant strives to imitate, resulting in a uniform taste across all establishments, even to the point where there is little distinction in the flavor of each dish. This is a great blow to the advantages of Chinese cuisine. For example, before 1921, walnut cream was only available in private Guangdong homes, and its preparation was more refined than later versions; its sweetness came from jujube broth rather than added sugar. In the decade that followed, it became available in every restaurant and consumed at every meal. The Chinese people's lack of critical thinking, blindly following the crowd, is truly innate. Every time I see the image of Wu Liang Shrine carvings used as a pattern on new book covers, all the same, I feel the same lament. There are many other patterns from Han paintings that could be used; is the tile-end design not good, or is the mirror inscription not good? No matter what it is, when it becomes so widespread, it will never be good.</p>
<p>The sense of taste requires variety the most. The excessive variety of Western cuisine is its weakness, but its combinations also have the beauty of complementing each other, such as cooked and raw, crisp and soft, rich and light, dry and wet, as long as they are not too biased toward one aspect. The ancients said, "Using water to dilute water, who can eat it?" If one cannot gather the strengths of all, innovate, and make the most of each, how can it be considered good cuisine? All artistic works must avoid rigidity and decay. To achieve this, one must first seek truth. The fundamental goodness of Chinese cuisine lies in preserving the original true flavor to the greatest extent possible. Some believe that ingredients like cabbage, bamboo shoots, and tofu have no flavor of their own, but this is not the case. It is not necessarily that sweet and salty are the only true flavors; bland is also a flavor. However, these ingredients are highly neutral, and when combined with other things, they can produce endless new flavors. These neutral ingredients are indispensable to good Chinese cuisine.</p>
<p>Every dish must have its main part. No matter how complex the ingredients, this main aspect must not be lost. For example, just as articles have a subject and a predicate, and prescriptions have a principal, assistant, adjuvant, and guide, once these are mixed up, the meaning becomes different. There must be distinctions in quantity, order, or preparation method.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "A large broth will not be exquisite." The highest realm of cooking is the absence of vulgar flavors, just as the greatest joy is not in pleasing the ear, and the most beautiful color is not in pleasing the eye. The Chinese artistic philosophy calls it "transcending the visible, returning from extreme splendor to simplicity." This principle is consistent. The popular three-word formula for chefs is "boil, soften, dilute." Although exaggerated, it reveals a profound truth. In short, the fewer seasonings used, the better. Especially recently, things like monosodium glutamate should only be used as a last resort, for quick fixes. If it is used frequently, thinking it can enhance the umami flavor, it is like adding another red carpet on top of a perfect carpet, not only useless but also harmful.</p>
<p>Cuisine is not only for eating, but also for seeing and smelling. The harmony of colors, the arrangement of forms, the management of positions, and the embellishment of the environment are all important. Generally, the shapes of animals are inevitably crude, so one should try to avoid exposing them. As for the natural colors and shapes of vegetables and fruits, they all have their own special advantages. Westerners pay great attention to this. Some say that Western cuisine is for looking at. Indeed, looking at it makes one feel refreshed, and the appetite naturally increases. This is the natural development of humanity's six senses, allowing one to enjoy the beautiful meaning of life. The emphasis on color, aroma, and taste in Chinese cuisine is for this very reason. Many vegetables should retain their original beautiful forms (such as celery, rapeseed sprouts, and carrots), preserve their green pigment, and fully utilize their nutritional value in cooking techniques. This is the right way. Many people still do not understand the importance of green pigment and cover the pot even after it is cooked. They do not realize that after being stir-fried in boiling oil, it is already thoroughly cooked, so there is no need to cook it further. Except for salt, there is no need to add any seasoning to preserve its raw and crisp deliciousness. This kind of cooking is often difficult to achieve in restaurants, but housewives should be aware of it. Chinese people do not pay much attention to eating raw vegetables, which is a major shortcoming. They can only resort to cold dishes to make up for it. Pickled vegetables in winter are simple, economical, and easy to eat. They do not lose their natural essence and are much more nutritious than pickled mustard tuber and Chinese turnip. Du Fu's poem says, "Crisp raw vegetables add beauty." Su Dongpo ate cold turnip after drinking. This is still the way it is eaten in the North. They mix pickled cabbage with ice in cold weather. Eating noodles must be mixed with raw scallions, raw radish, raw bean sprouts, and cilantro. They also eat corn and millet as their staple food, and the distribution of their diet is more reasonable, so their health seems to be stronger than that of southerners.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said, "Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish." This is a saying that people who are particular about cooking quote with pride. How should this be explained? I think the art of cooking is connected to politics. It lies in everyone being content with their place and making the most of their abilities. Almost no ingredient is unusable in cooking. Those who are good at using them can turn the rotten into the magical, never letting anyone feel left out. Once used, they must be able to fully express their unique advantages. That's all. Skill advances to the level of Tao. This is what it means.</p>

<p>The misty sea merges with the breath of flowers, languidly leaning on the east wind, charmingly awakening. Unsentimental, full of regret, with shallow and deep reds, cutting off the root of the past, transplanting it with new tears. A sorrowful spring, already resigned to being haggard, quietly appreciating the distant, precious clusters, supporting its long-lasting intoxication. Let the butterfly messengers and bee matchmakers have their way, look at its delicate and charming form. A guest used a rhyming poem to request a descriptive piece for the season, so I wrote this interpretation.</p>

<p>Now I believe the tide has its promise. Evening after evening, morning after morning, rain after rain, wind after wind in gusts.

One regret is longing, one regret is longing with hatred. Saying that lately people are not close, line after line of pearly tears, line after line of powder.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Suggestion <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Yu</p>
<p>"Suggestibility," also known as "suggestion receptivity" in psychology, is the most basic principle of hypnotism. We often accept other people's suggestions without even realizing it. Now I'm going to ask you readers a question: "In English, is it correct to say that six plus seven (is) fourteen, or is it correct to say that six plus seven (are) fourteen?" Some of you will think that (is) is correct, and some will think that (are) is correct, without realizing that six plus seven is not fourteen at all. This is because when I asked the question, I suggested to you that one of the two sentences above is correct, and the only difference between the two sentences is that one uses (is) and the other uses (are). So you accepted my suggestion and focused on these two words.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to ask you to calculate a problem. You can only look at the problem once, and you have to calculate it very quickly. The problem is:</p>
<p>"A train with fifteen passengers departs from the starting point. At the next stop, three people get on and seven people get off. At the next stop, six people get on and five people get off. At the next stop, eight people get on and ten people get off. At the next stop, nine people get on and two people get off. At the next stop, five people get on and eleven people get off. At the next stop, seven people get on and three people get off. How many stops has the train made now?"</p>
<p>If you really want to calculate quickly, I believe you will have to go back and count again to answer me. In fact, how many people get on and off at each stop is completely irrelevant to the answer I want. I deliberately said the unnecessary number of people, so readers only counted the number of people and ignored the stops.</p>
<p>Children's suggestibility is simply astonishing. Someone conducted several experiments to test the suggestibility of thirty elementary school children, and the results were extremely interesting. He first had a French teacher led into the classroom to introduce him to the children, and then the teacher left, and he began to ask questions. He first asked them what color the French teacher's beard was. As a result, eleven children said it was brown, eight said it was gray, five said it was white, two said it was red, and only four were correct, they said he had no beard. Then he asked them whether the teacher was holding his hat in his left hand or his right hand when he came in to speak. As a result, seventeen said he was holding it in his left hand, eleven said he was holding it in his right hand, and the remaining two were smart, they said he was not holding a hat in his hand. But in fact, the teacher's hat was always properly worn on his head!</p>
<p>In court, suggestibility is often cleverly used to uncover the truth of a case. A mechanic requested alimony from the railway company where he worked, because his arm could not move after a train accident. The company's lawyer sympathetically asked him how high he could lift his left arm now. He painfully raised it only about an inch. The lawyer then asked if his left arm was completely healthy before the accident, and he replied that it was. So the lawyer said very politely:</p>
<p>"Now let me see how high you could lift your left arm before the accident."</p>
<p>The plaintiff inadvertently lifted his left arm over his head, which caused the whole court to burst into laughter, and the truth was revealed.</p>

<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Last Thursday, I went to Suzhou for business, and in the Kaixuan train carriage, I was reading Chen Congzhou's "Yu Dafu's Year of Birth" in this publication. The reason why I wrote that Dafu was 54 years old in 1945 was because Dafu himself wrote it in his will. This error, perhaps Dafu intentionally added a few years to his age, just like his exaggeration about having more than five million volumes of books in his Hangzhou residence and saying he had been in business for eight years.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, when I finished reading Chen Congzhou's article, Dafu's eldest son, Yu Fei, was also on the same train to Suzhou, sitting in the seat next to me. (He had come to my house on Wednesday evening to chat and also said that he would go to Suzhou the next morning.) I asked him about his late father's age. He said: I don't remember exactly how old he would be this year, but I only remember that he was born in the year of Bing Shen, which seems to be 52 years old. So, what Chen Congzhou heard seems to be correct. In my article, I just copied his will as it was, and at the time I did not refer to other materials to explain it for him, which should be stated.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent situation of Dafu's several sons, I think that people who care about Dafu's orphans would like to know a general overview. The eldest son, Fei, is currently studying at a university in Shanghai and will graduate in more than a year. He currently lives on Emei Road. He studies political science, and although he likes literature, he only considers it a "side business." In recent years, he has also been very careful to collect writings and anecdotes about Dafu that have been published in various publications.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Dafu's complete works, according to his will, he wrote more than ten kinds of works, and no royalties have been received for more than ten years. However, it is said that Dafu gave nine books to the Beixin Bookstore for publication during his lifetime. And the rights to these nine books are not in the names of his three sons. Therefore, Dafu's statement in his will that "if someone negotiates with the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore on behalf of the publishing house, then the three sons who are in the country can get tens of thousands of yuan" is not based on any documentary evidence, and the bookstore said that Dafu's advance royalties are still overdrawn. Thus, the assertion that no royalties have been received for more than ten years and that tens of thousands of yuan can be obtained by negotiating with the bookstore are indeed conflicting. During this period, the copyright for the compilation of Dafu's complete works has become a problem, and the sales of the book are also in doubt. Therefore, no one has started editing it for three years, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>Dafu's second son, Yun, is currently in Fuyang, and his third son, Jun, is currently in Fujian, both of whom are attending school. The three brothers are in different places, working hard at their studies, which is reassuring to the literary friends who care about Dafu's orphans. I will add a few words in passing.</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Record of Xu Zijin <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Xu Zijin was a dealer in antiques during the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns of the late Qing Dynasty. However, he was famous throughout the country, and Grand Historian Jiang Jianxia published his book "A Dream Record Before the Threshold." Scholars who study editions have repeatedly praised his book. Although Zijin's book only records stationery, inkstones, calligraphy, famous paintings, and books, which the sages called minor skills, they are all true insights and have something worth seeing.</p>
<p>Zijin's name was Kang, and his alias was Cuan Sou. He was from Wujun. He resided at the Old Mountain Building of the Zhao family in my hometown for a long time, helping Zhao Feixi, Esq., distinguish the antiques in his collection. Wu Kutie once said: "Zijin is an expert in connoisseurship. He can distinguish the authenticity of bronzes, calligraphy, and paintings as soon as they come into his hands. He is like Song Shangqiu today." Kutie's standards were higher than the top of his head, and he did not lightly praise people. His words like this show Zijin's learning.</p>
<p>This spring, I bought a handwritten copy of Zijin's "Pine Heart Notes" at the Qinchuan Bookstore in Suzhou, with three seals: "Xu Kang," "Xike," and "Shangchi Xian Guan," as well as two long postscripts by Zijin. The book was handwritten by Zijin's nephew, Ziyu. The notes are medical cases written by Old Man Miao Songxin of Wumen. Songxin was the son of Wenzi, and his family served as officials for generations, with spare time for medical arts. Zijin's postscript says: "The above are all the old man's newly made prescriptions, with refined thinking and wonderful principles, finally achieving success. Today's doctors are all unskilled, studying for less than a day and seeking quick results, eagerly hanging up their medicine bags to make a living. They are at a loss when they hear of difficulties, and they cannot distinguish between the real and the false. I once said that the scholar-officials of ancient times were all versed in medical theory, and even specialized experts must have deep learning, whether hidden or apparent, but sufficient to be immortal. Today's scholar-officials despise it as a lowly art, and those who practice medicine are all frivolous young men, with little money to study and insufficient strength to do business, so they learn medicine out of boredom and try it out casually..." Zijin was well-versed in medical theory, so his words were so poignant.</p>
<p>Zijin's son, Hanqing, was able to inherit his learning. He once forged a "General Who Conquered Liao" seal to deceive Wu Xianzhong, the governor. After obtaining this seal, the governor renewed his old ambition to ask for the mission to face the disaster of the Japanese pirates, and ultimately failed. This was the fault of a bookish armchair strategist. The novel "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" uses "Yu Hanqing" as a veiled reference to Hanqing's name. Kezhai was an expert in ancient appraisal, but he was deceived by Hanqing; then Hanqing's family learning was indeed enough. It is a pity that he did not follow the right path, and he was only known for his skill in forgery. Zijin's learning, on the other hand, was original, with exhaustive knowledge and wide hearing, and he would not disdain to do such a thing. However, today's antique dealers lack even this skill of forgery.</p>
