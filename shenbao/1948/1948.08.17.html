<h3>「面對蘇聯」　美外交政策協會報告　謂美不欲以軍米援華</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十五日電〕外交政策協會報告稱：「美國不甚願意以大量的軍火援助中國政府」。因恐「蘇聯將以相同或吏多數量之軍火接濟巾共」。該報告題爲「面對蘇聯」。爲哥侖比亞大學國際關係教授，灰波茨坦會讓美國代表團顧問馬士萊所撰。渠稱：「在中國方國，美國與蘇聯都小心謹愼選免以短兵相接，無論蘇聯的實力如何，歐洲所冒的險與代價都比蘇聯大」。報告內稱：蘇聯曾要求迫令日本向美蘇聯軍投降，爲美國所拒絕，後又要求美蘇共管日本，亦被美國拒絕。</p>
<p>一段外交史話</p>
<p>馬氏報告稱：蘇聯兩次要求被拒絕後，莫洛托夫遂在一九四六年倫敦外長會議中作梗，使對德衛星國家之和約工作趨於停止。此後，莫洛托夫提出討論日本問題，曾被接受。馬氏指出二倫敦會議三月之後，美國與蘇聯同意成立遠東委員會及東京遠東法庭，決定佔鎭曾本之政策。馬氏附帶提出在一九四五年波茨坦會議時，史達林說過：蘇聯不能允許戰後在東歐國家內有自由選舉的制度，因爲如此將產生「反蘇維埃」政策。</p>
<p>綜括需聯在遠東之各項活動，馬氏稱：美國認爲「一個友好的日本是美國太平洋方面安全的必要條件」。可是，從蘇聯方面看，對於美國這糧新的擴農，表示懷疑。馬氏稱：蘇聯「堅決拒絕」根據美國所擬的條件與日本締結和約。按美國所擬草案中無否決權一項。渠又稱：「可是，將來美國可能與日本單獨媾和，議蘇聯與日本仍在戰爭狀態之中」。馬氏對此不再作進一步的推敲。</p>
<p>敘及韓國事件，馬氏稱：蘇聯迄今無意放鬆其在北部的控制權。渠稱：「這就是他們的政策，希望由於無限期的延宕，可以比美國佔領軍多滯留一些時候」。</p>
<p>蘇聯可能妥協</p>
<p>雖然，馬氏認爲美蘇間爭執，現在尙未有取得協調之基礎。渠稱：若因此面認爲「一切談判均將毫無結果」實馬巨大錯誤。渠稱：「在勢力與政治局面尙未明期之前，某些間題是無法解決或改善的·」屬氏稱：蘇聯可能會暫時表示妥協，而「美蘇爭執將告消弭」。渠並稱：自一九一七年至一九二一年，蘇聯領袖們都認爲戰爭與失敗已造成「中歡，尤其是法國，共產黨革命的時機」。此種革命高潮使二十年代中資本主義得到暫時的　定。但是，「蘇聯的共產主義學說繼續預言『第二次的戰爭與革命」」。</p>
<p>馬氏稱：一九四六以來，蘇聯在這「第二次」戰爭中確已取得「最大的便宜」。但是現在可認爲已經過去，另一「平衡」時期已經開始，假如他們將有什麼行動，那就是他們將採取一種較爲妥協的態度對付美國。</p>

<h3>美援價款的凍結問題</h3>
<p>美援物資出售後所得之怯幣，除照約支付各種必要費用外，如果以大部份彌補赤字財政，有人估計，可避免印發四百萬億以上的新鈔：另有人推算，照我國月前發行額，這筆款項，至少可抵銷所發行通貨百分之五十·其實法幣對美匯價，在逐臼低落中，故以法幣折算，此款究有多少，在目前尙難作準確之佔計。所可知者，這筆資金，如果能確實商定，作爲彌補歲虧之用；則於國家預算之平衡，與新鈔增發之减低，必將發生決定性的作用，從而緩和漲風，與穩定經濟這個共通的目標，至少可期部份的達到。</p>
<p>但美方主張，似尙側重在再生產這一途，就是要把這筆款項的大部份，依舊用在各種生產方面。這在通常時期，原是極正當的辦怯，因爲彌補政費，其作用過於消極，不能直接達到發展經濟的目的。過去各種外債之所以爲人詬病，與國家對外債務之所以日益增加，其毛病也就出在這地方。美方懲前毖後，着重於再生產，其中雖未必無多做生意的作用在內，然就大體論，開發生產事業，對於國計民生，總是有利的·而且要維持國脈，發展國力，尤非走上這一條途徑不可。不過值此共匪擾亂，烽火遍地之秋，非從速戡平大亂，安定秩序，實在談不上經濟建設。故在通貨惡性膨脹，經濟動盪之時，非從速平衡收支，穩定幣值，亦實在談不上增加生產。不看見現在僅有的產業，尙多陷入搖搖欲倒的危境嗎？洋商在華的事業，也不是同樣地戚到非常困難嗎？所以從原則上講，我們對於美方的主張，原當同意，但於緩急輕重孰先孰後之間，却不能不希望他們爲中國再作一度愼重的考慮。</p>
<p>至所謂特別帳戶的凍結，其內容如何，亦尙欠明瞭。就常理論，任何資金一經凍結，卽在規定的期間不許動用，其作用乃在限制所有權人的隨時支用，藉以减少市塲上的籌碼，其於抽緊遊資，緩和漲風，自亦不無小補。不過凍結的效力，照例只及於存款的所有人，而不能及於所存的銀行。因爲銀行的責任，限於到期支付，無負委托，並沒有把這筆凍結資金，如數呆擱在保管庫裏的義務，更沒有備足等額現鈔，長斯呆擱的必要。所以這筆資金，在存戶方面，雖然凍結，但在銀行方面，依舊可以運用，實際上並不凍結。換句話說：這筆資金，依舊可由銀行在市塲流通，依舊是一宗鉅額的遊資，所謂法幣回籠，到底亦不過是一句空話，其實毫無影響。相反地，因有追一筆長期不動用的凍結存款，在銀行方面，反而不營增加了一宗無須卽時支付的鉅額籌碼，可以依法運用，助長了它的貸借能力，與囤貨本錢。如果這樣，那與收縮通貨，抑平物價的宗旨，豈非背道而馳？假如此款凍結以後，銀行亦須如數凍結，不許自由運用，那末，各銀行也不致大家來想爭攬這筆凍結的存款了。推情度理，他們總不會空着倉庫，自己不用，情願來替人堆存這一批鉅額的鈔票吧！</p>
<p>有人以爲：所謂凍結，當然指的是繳存國庫，無形中等於彌補赤字。我門希望這種說法，並非空言。因爲只有照這樣做。纔可以幫助政府平衡財政，减少發行；亦只有照這樣做，纔可以綏和漲風，穩定經濟。然而不用轉入國庫字樣，而偏用凍結這兩字，似與名實不甚相符。希望在正式商定的時候，另用較淸晰的詞句，以釋羣疑，也可免得在「凍結」兩字的掩護下再做走私的文章！</p>

<h3>復興中國農村（下）</h3>
<p>記晏陽初先生一段談話</p>
<p>推行自衛自治的組織教育：組織教育的對象亦是農民，目的一在健全農村武裝自衛保鄉的力量，一在增進農民自治以爲運用政權實施憲政的基礎平教會在定縣曾推行「公民教育」多年，曾厘定基本道德的標準是：（一）大德無私，（二）勇敢無畏，（三）兼愛無偏，（四）眞誠無偽，明智無惑，和許多其他對己對人對公等等標準。晏先生在談到組織教育的時候，指出在實行憲政談農村建設復興的今日，組識教育也就是農村的自衛自治問題，與文藝生產健康三項教育具有着密切的關連。晏先生說：「報章上娓娓動人的文章，言冕堂皇的立法條　，並不能實施憲政，請問人民連名字都不會寫，肚皮都吃不飽，贏弱待斃，何以談自衛文一醫生產健康與組織的相依爲命：晏先生接着進一步說明生活是一個有機體，偏枯偏榮於任何一方面都是不健全的，專談農業救國或者教靑救國的結果，單獨都不能有所成就。晏先生闡述四者的連鎖性與相互關運的特質稱：識字能文，方可接受教育，農林與盛，民有川餘裕　有心情與精力談其他，健康也憑藉着知識與豐富方可進步，進步後也才有從事生產教育與組織的條件，而組織教育是唯一協助老百姓管理自己的事情的必經階段。晏氏繼說明教育本身在農村建設上具有啟發性的作用；「人民有教育方才可以自動自發自行改善。」但是四者雖然相互關連，在農村推行時，却儘可因地制宜，視地方情况而決定自何者先行開始，生產沒落者，可先自生產教育始，民智落後者，可自文藝教育始，然　且開始，則四者都要同趨並進；鄉村是整個的，改進鄉村生活不應是片段的。</p>
<p>研究實驗興推廣，實於過去如平民民教育促進會在定縣實驗工作，都是私人學術機關的研究實驗，現在農村復興聯合委員會的設立，則是從政府立塲的推廣。平教會自民國十二年倡始，十九年在河北定縣實驗，繼於衡山·四川新都設立機構，從事實驗。這三個地點的選擇，都在求其在所在地區的代表性，它們分別代表了華北華巾和華西三個廣大的地帶。晏先生特別提出在同一個時期由梁漱淇·梁仲蓼諸先生主持的山東鄒平的山東鄉村建設研究院，江蘇無錫與踐主持的江蘇教育學院，陶行知先生所領導的南京曉莊學校和上海寶山工學國，以及燕京大學，協和醫學院，淸華大學，金陵大學，華西大學，南開大學等教育機構，在對村建設的實驗工作，都有重大的貢獻。晏氏說：數十年來從事農運人士之深入民間，研究培義民力的方法與制度，一反一般學人的鎖研巾西書籍，實在可以說是一種革命性據我動。晏先生認為數十年來的中國鄉村建設運動，已經以科學化之方法進行了研究實驗的工作，各省在戰前戰時亦有相當的推度工作，即指平教曾即先後與廣西·湖南和江西等省府從事規模的推廣工作。至於全國性的以龐大財力，集合中美專家，并由政府以政治力量，扶持推動，則係自今日馬肇瑞。</p>
<p>主持人的評語：晏先生對農村復興聯合委會的設立，表示欣慰，對將來的成就也具有信心。他說：這次在美援巾指定專款作爲增進中國農民福利，解餘中國農民痛苦之用，足以顯云美國人民對中國人民的尊重和同情，他們根據對日抗戰中，共同作戰的經驗，信仰中國的老百姓蘊藏贊無窮的偉大的力量，不　始終沒有機會發展，現在農村建設的工作，應該達到培育發揮他們力量的目的。晏先生以卅年從事巾國農村建設運動，成績斐然，早巳獲得巾外學術界共同的景仰。他對農村建設方而研究心得與實際經驗，決非在簡短的一夕談話中，所能够望其梗概的。晏氏此次接受了政府的重任，顯然對重建苦難多災的巾國農村，具有極大的信心，下面便籍着晏先生自己的談話來作爲結果：</p>
<p>「中國已有近卅作歷史的求增加農民福利，解除農民痛苦的農村方案。這次，美援將協助我們，以推行農村建設的運動。要之，外援無非協助我們充分發展「自力」，我們憑着「自力」方可達到「更生」，一切都要自己的努力與社會各方的合作。」（完）</p>

<h3>三使節再晤蘇外長　解決柏林危機仍爲獲協議　蘇堅持終止西德政府計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十六臼廣播：英美法三國使節十六日與蘇外長莫洛托夫再度會談，以期解決柏林危機及其他德國問題。會議於下午六時在克林姆林宮舉行，約歷一小時之久。會後三國使節代表各該國政府在英國大使館內會商此次會議之結果。截止目前爲止，西方列强外交人員已與莫洛托夫及其此蘇聯官員會談凡十二小時以上，包括與史達林之一次會晤在內。據英大使史密斯透露，截至本日爲止，雙方談話尙未獲得結論。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十六日廣播拍林訊：西德政府計劃雖巳遭蘇聯之反對，西方軍事領袖仍積極進行該項計劃。美駐德司令克萊與英法駐德司令定於十六日與德國領袖會晤，草擬西德政府臨時憲法。西方國家並擬於九月巾舉行會議，擬具共管魯爾區之詳細方案。關於莫斯科秘密會議，據悉蘇聯堅特終止西德政府計劃，此或係會談不能獲致協議之最大障碍云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕克林姆宮談話爲時已久，迄宋有官方文告，一般原以爲談判可促成四外長會議，今者此一希望益趨渺茫。西方國家仍繼續推行產生西德政府之計劃，而蘇聯之反對該計劃，則爲眾所周知之事實。英美法駐德三總司令預定於十六日在法蘭克福與德政界領袖商討西德計劃，簽訂倫敦西德協定之六個西方國家亦將於下月會商共管魯爾區之細則，依照計劃，德國代表將於九月問開會，以產生西德國家之臨時憲怯。西歐外交界正希望美蘇間之問謀糾紛不致打消東西成立協定之最後一綫希望。彼等以爲該項糾紛應不致影響談判，然仍戚戚然抱有杞憂。英國報章反映民意對東西關係極爲關注，唯恐昔年綏靖政策重見今日。</p>

<p>〔合眾社柏林十六日電〕自由民主黨之「黑迥聲報」十六日載稱，蘇聯外次維辛斯基最近曾親至柏林視察，當即下令德國共黨淸黨，並改組爲「戰鬥幹部」。該報稱，自維氏訪柏林後，克林姆宮即越蘇軍總司令索柯落夫斯基，直接向下級命令，而由莫斯科直接監視及指揮蘇聯之在德政策。現在蘇聯駐德之新長官爲兩月前抵此之羅柯蘇夫斯基。西方情報方面稱，羅氏現任蘇聯西方軍總司令，總轄德奧兩地，總部設於白俄羅斯首府明斯克。又據情報官稱，羅氏可能現在德境親自指揮一月前伊始之戰學玩意，然西方觀察家無人能證實維辛斯基曾來德國。「星期一迥聲報」又稱，羅維兩人曾與德共領袖披克上校及島別烈克舉行數次會議。前者下令黨員應加爾淸，唯准「非常活動及忠心」之共產黨員留在黨內。淸黨應推廣至蘇佔區之經濟委員會，工業及警察。又稱，維辛斯基更令共黨不得再與東德非共黨合作，故預測蘇區即將取締自由民主黨及基督教民主黨。西方觀察家認爲顯然此係蘇聯之方業，並稱蘇聯已準備倣效匈牙利及捷克，命令東德發動「人民的革命」</p>
<h3>柏林東西區　貨幣戰激烈</h3>
<p>〔合眾社柏林十六日電〕西方當局承認，彼等正爲西德馬克流入蘇方之手一事祖憂。在蘇聯凍結東德馬克賬戶後，此種現象即繼續發生。一般揣測蘇聯可能累積西德馬克，或以資助西德之共黨活動，或於將來在西德佔區傾銷，使新通貨膨脹。自六月廿三日西德幣制改革後，在柏林流通之西德馬克，總值約四億，柏林西區德人正要求增加流通額，以解除因蘇方封鎖通貨而造成的財政窘困，西方當局亦同意此種見解。但法蘭克福銀行官員則懷疑在現狀下增加柏林西區的西德馬克流通額，是否適當。柏林三反共政具在上週末同西方當局提出備忘錄，要求承認西德馬克爲柏林西區唯一合法的通貨，共黨則又把握住此項晴求。蘇方軍事機關報著論要求推翻目前的柏林市議會，而代以共黨集團。該文中稱：反共集團要求承認西德馬克爲合法通貨，企圖阻　莫斯科會談中東西問的任何協議。</p>

<p>〔合眾社貝爾格勒十六日電〕出席多瑙河會議之英美法代表十六日宣佈不參加起草委員會草擬新的多瑙河公約之工作。美代表加農大使稱，起草會之工作僅爲依次序排列三四修正案而已。既然英文已非正式文字，此時參加實爲不智。蘇聯代表維辛維基動議邀請英代表參加起草曾，然被英代表主席貝克所拒。維氏稱如美國不願參加大會之工作，「吾人仍將繼續」而認爲不參加諸國態度欠周。貝克最後宣布起草委負會之成立，由蘇聯·匈牙利·捷克·保加利亞及南斯拉夫五國組成之。英國認爲蘇聯對公約第四十一條之修正案不妥，使有關糾紛之國家有權評涉本國之行動，乃另提修正案，美國加以全力支持。</p>

<p>由於蘇聯曾在四强咨詢委員會巾明白表示反對英國託管西倫列加及法國託管費辛，因此英法在里比亞問題上可能站在同一戰綫。但新聞封鎖政策尙在執行中，故會議內容尙未正式公佈。又會議本星期由法大使使馬薛格里任主席。</p>

<h3>公用事業堅拒減價市長提出四項建議　勸於考慮後今日到府報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月份公用事業售價，經市參議會臨時大會決議核减後，吳市長於昨日下午三時召集谷公司代表在市府談話，各公司對减價之議，斷然拒絕，態度堅決。昨日被邀出席談話會者，除美商電力，美商電話，英商自來水，英商煤氣，英商電車，法商水電，華商閘北，浦東等各公司代表外，有市參議會潘議長，徐副議長，秘書長項昌權，公用小組召集人李文杰，姜豪及公用局長趙曾珏等卅餘人。會議達四小時之久。</p>
<p>各公用事業公司代表先後發言，陳述各該公司收支不敷情形，希望不再核减，甚且謂如市民拒繳或緩繳新價。致公司收入减少，不能不停水斷電，應由議決核减價格之機關負責云云。上海電力公司總經理賀浦金斯（賀淸）則主張由政府貼補，而不願貸款。當經吳市長及潘議長，徐副議長，姜參議員豪，李參議員文杰，趙局長曾珏等再四勸導，仍無具體結果。潘議長詳述市參議會爲此事煞費苦心，始於臨時大會經五小時之鄭重討論，獲得此核减價格之折衷辦法。如各公司固執己見，拒不接受，甚至恃其專利營業之特權，用停水斷電爲要挾，則影響社會治安，其責任應令由各公司負之。此須請市長及公用局長特別注意者。吳市長最後提出四項建議：（一）各公司接受市參議會之八月份核减價格；（二）其八月份收支不敷之實數，由市府會同市參議會代向中央銀行請予貸款；（三）貸款攤還本息辦法，商請酌予延長分期，俾减輕負擔；（四）從速組織公用事業公開調査審議委員會，本星期三即行開會，秉公審査各公司收支實况，重訂九月份起之核價標準。市長並盼各公司代表回去考慮，今日（星二）下午三時再到市府報吿結果，期能圓滿解決。</p>
<h3>若以停供俏要挾有權請政府接管　潘議長會後向記者表示</h3>
<p>潘議長公展於會議散後向記者表示；（一）此次公用事業漲價過鉅，引起一般市民反感，致有拒繳運動之醞釀，參議會乃根據六七十位參議員之緊急提議，先交公用小組委員會研討，嗣再召集臨時大會，詳加辯論，方通過折衷方案，自信不偏不倚，差能對市民負担及公司經濟雙方兼顧，且亦惟有如此，或能得一較爲合理之解決。（二）此次公用事業新價，計算方式中之指數另加50％一點毫無根據何况此項計算方式是否合理，根本尙成問題。若謂事經工商部核定，便可任意妄加市民負担，而不容許市參議會有過問之權，則今後市民如有任何拒繳緩繳運動發生，當不能謂參議會事先不籌消弭之策。且市長曾向參議會交議專案，希望組織公開調査審議會，負責核定價格事宜，則市參議會之有權與否，還須問之政府當局。</p>
<p>獨占企業　有其責任</p>
<p>（三）各公司如恃其公用事業爲獨占企業，即隨便以停止供應爲要挾，是其存心破壞社會秩序，決非市民所能容忍。須知凡獨佔企業，有其權利，亦必有其責任；在平時然，在非常時期尤然。深信中外各公司當局如認淸時代，面對現實，當不致採取此種下策，否則辜負市參議會一番平停之苦心，將必自食其惡果。蓋於萬不得已時，民意機關有權要求地方政府，仿照英美政府於戰時對付煤礦罷工之辦法，暫時接管此類蓄意要挾之任何公司，以期不使市民生活受其影響。</p>
<p>希望政府　目光放遠</p>
<p>（四）余早料及公用事業之迭次漲價，必將釀成社會騷動故屢向中央呼籲，必須重視，或採貼補，或予貸款，並預結三個月外匯預購三個月燃料材料，以便力求公用事業價格之穩定，從而减少一般物價上漲之刺激，惜中樞當局，眼光極近，視爲無足重輕。但願今後能正視現實，務其遠大，力使公用事業可以維持，而人民負祖可以减輕，苟一般物價上漲之趨勢能因之而稍緩，在中央所收穫者已大矣。</p>
<h3>吳開先返滬談　物價高漲原因</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕平劇坤伶李綺蓮（見圖。本報攝）與其情人退伍軍官劉竹書之桃色糾紛消息曾誌十四日本報，茲悉李伶因劉已使君有婦，除自悔遇人不淑外，不欲再與之計較，故已購妥機票，將於今日北返故都，仍獻身於藝壇　據李伶吿記者，渠因受劉之欺騙，四月間在平曾服毒自殺，其事且遍載平津各報。李與劉之相識，係在今年舊曆正月間，於大井胡同八號坤伶吳素秋之母老山東家中，惟所傳當時共作方城之戲，結果李輸去黃金二兩，劉慷慨不計，因此發生感情之說，則據李稱並無其事。當時劉爲某師部之軍需，風度翩翩，手面闊綽，固一情塲好手也。自與李相識後，即追求頗力，李漸爲所動，終至發生關係，其後李以有孕，遂要求結婚，而劉則百般敷衍，甚至避不見面。李憤而自殺獲救後，劉又來甜言蜜語，且允於六月二十九日在平結婚，不料至二十五日竟不吿來滬。李追蹤南來，至滬後知劉去台灣廣州，李亦追往，但劉態度已變。兩人旋又先後返滬。十三日劉偕其妻同行在南京路與李相遇，竟視同陌路，李追隨至楓林橋，終於互扭入警察局，但又和解了事。如李之遭遇，足爲今日若干歡塲女子之寫照也。</p>

<h3>放行走私鋼纜　索酬引起內鬨　供應局稽查等多人被起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院物資供應局儲運處提運組職員杭州人陳恕平，前經派駐開平碼頭辦理該局自國外運來美軍剩餘物資之提運事宜。邵國正·楊崇舜·嚴錫繁·王以誠·李寳範·劉蘭馨·丁文濬·盛斌全·王澤民等九人，則均係該局稽査大隊之稽査員，分駐各碼頭，稽査物資運卸。前月廿五日有本市李永記裝卸公司之外勤職員葛星坤，得悉物資供應局租用之克拉克培雷勝利號輪船，自關島裝運美軍剩餘物資來滬，船中有外籍水手若干人携帶鋼纜十梱，匿藏艙內，擬走私至滬脫售，惟以碼頭警衛森嚴，未能登岸，葛乃與素識之陳恕平商洽，當由陳介紹葛與在輪上値勤之邵國正相識，葛遂得與該輪外籍水手直接洽購該項鋼纜。至同月廿八日深夜十二時許，葛搖一小舢板至輪上卸貨，但因深宵裝運大量鋼纜，航行浦江，易啓警察機關疑竇，當由邵國正介紹楊崇舜·李寳範協助，使葛得以押運離輪。同時嚴錫繁即向葛索酬報，葛遂付以美金四十元，旋由在逃稽査員郭旬姐樓下，爲恐各稽査員於値勤之際目擊前情據而吿發，遂將該款平均俵分，計邵國正。嚴錫繁·王以誠·李寳範·劉蘭馨·丁文濬·盛斌全·王澤民等各分得美金五元五角，並商請邵國正等同意合作，共守秘密，衆皆欣然允受。翌日楊崇舜以押運鋼纜，未獲酬勞，即赴葛處索取法幣五億元，葛以購買鋼纜獲利甚微，未允給付，楊即袖出利刃加以恐嚇，經郭旬旭從中調解，給付一億元而罷，郭則又乘機索詐美金二十元而去。同日下午陳恕平·邵國正，亦追踪前往葛家中索酬，並稱該項鋼纜是否係供應局公物，尙不可知，設吝不給酬，當據情報吿主管機關沒收處罰，以爲要挾。葛情虛畏罪，迫不獲已，當付給邵國正美金十元，並邀約陳恕平等次日在愛多亞路某四川飯館內叙談，屆時葛即出法幣四千萬元，陳等以爲數太微，拒不接受，嘖嘖而別，嗣陳深恨邵·郭二人獨獲厚酬，未肯分潤，遂向部·郭嚴詞交涉，幾至動武，邵恐陳先向供應一局舉發，乃聯合嚴錫繁·郭旬旭·王以誠·李寳繁。劉蘭馨·丁文濬·盛斌全·王澤民等以書面呈報該局主管人員。該局乃將陳葛等傳拘到局，詎郭旬旭則已於同月三十日乘機潛逸無踪，經該局將所有案卷移送地檢處偵査，現已終結，分別以違反懲治走私條例及恐嚇等罪嫌，提起公訴。</p>

<h3>肉孜節在迪化　維兒吾·哈薩·回教·各族教胞集合</h3>
<p>〔本報迪化十一日航訊〕在朝汗回敎胞摒擋行裝，紛紛飛滬出國之際，迪化市的伊斯蘭敎徒，已度過一個月修心養性的淸齋期，又在天山南北亢熱的氣流下，以最愉快的心情，歡度其一年一度的肉孜節。肉孜節將臨的前幾天，麥斯武德主席特分電國內各回敎首長和各回敎團體，同時分電新疆各地的伊斯蘭敎胞，共迎此盛况空前的肉孜佳節。新省物價管制機構，也備有大量的淸油·羊肉·大量平價配售。省公務員合作社，也以低廉的價格配售白糖，大米（限敎胞），靑年服務社也怕貧苦的敎胞無資渡節，特將貧民救濟金新幣四千萬元，趕於節前發放，藉以補助。</p>
<p>公務員休假三天</p>
<p>說今年的肉孜節盛况空前，並無絲毫誇張之意，實在的，新省府爲此宣佈自八月六日起，所屬各機關的伊斯蘭敎公務員休假三天，非伊斯蘭敎公務員也沾了光，休假一天。七日一淸早，南樑一帶的敎胞區，家家懸旗結彩，鑼鼓喧闐。賀年的行列，浩蕩過市，大街小巷，車水馬龍。敎胞的子女們穿着得花枝招展的在街頭跳躍，到處喜氣洋溢，一片平氣象！</p>
<p>奶瑪子操塲舉行</p>
<p>八時剛到，在迪化從來沒有在一起做過奶瑪子（按；意即祈禱）的維吾爾·哈薩·回敎各族敎胞，都自動的在新疆學院後邊的大操塲上集合，竟達一萬五千餘人之多。整個的迪化市，現在還沒有能容納這末多人的禮拜寺，所以不得不改在這邊疆最高學府的操場上舉行。</p>
<p>祈禱式隆重荘嚴</p>
<p>祈禱儀式由維族大阿訇穆罕莫德尼主持，各族敎胞的首長麥斯武德主席，馬良駿總敎長，艾沙秘書長成吉思汗理事長等，都前往參加，並先後致詞，略謂：本省和平安定與民族團結，今天又創一新紀錄的象徵，今天又得到一種新的保障。每個敎胞均按旣定的隆重莊嚴儀式，默默的爲新中國的富强康樂與新疆的安定進步，作誠摯的祈禱。</p>
<p>非教徒紛往拜賀</p>
<p>在另一方面，非伊斯蘭敎徒的各軍政首長，上午十時在新大樓集合，共有三十多人，由剛到新疆才兩三天的陶兼司令峙岳領頭，以長蛇陣式的汽車行列，穿越全市區，分別到伊斯蘭敎各首長。阿訇。士紳的家裏去拜賀。在麥斯武德主席官邸，在馬呈祥指揮官，馬總敎長，艾沙秘書長，王廳長，伊敏廳長，白副廳長及各大阿訇私寓，都有異常熱烈的慶賀和答諭，主人更以自製的油香及淸茶款客。彼等對於陶兼司令的光降，尤表榮幸。</p>
<p>歌舞劇熱烈演出</p>
<p>爲慶祝肉孜節而上演的五幕歌舞劇「妮牙孜小姐」，是麥主席的得意傑作，由穆罕莫德埃買提阿吉導演，靑年歌舞團（即新疆歌舞訪問團）全體演出。天剛落黑，維文總會門前已擠得水洩不通，樓上樓下，剎時即無立足之地。售票之多，打破過去任何公演的紀錄。南樑廣塲也放映電影，免費招待人民。</p>
<p>肉孜節的第三天，伊斯蘭敎婦女才出現街頭，互相拜年，大紅大綠，衣飾華麗，車兒馬兒，叮吟噹啷，色彩令人目炫，喜氣充滿銜頭。（林）</p>

<h3>廿五萬票面關金劵發行後　現鈔恐慌逐漸解除　市面反映頗佳物價未起劇變</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二十五萬票面之關金劵，昨日起在各地發行，央行發行局方面表示：當視市面之需要而供應，不作無限度之發行。按此項大鈔，運往外埠使用者居大都份，故截至目前爲止，在本市流通者爲數不多。金融當局希望此項關金發行後，各地之現鈔恐慌得以解除；兩週來本票之到處流通，乃現鈔恐慌下之畸形現象，金管局決自即日起嚴行取締。</p>
<p>又昨日雖値廿五萬關金發行之日，紗布日用品行情反全面回跌一成，華股亦一致下挫，質出一般市民意料之外。分析其原因，殆不外下列數端：（一）昨日雖爲巨額關金發行之日，但當局對預防物價波動起見，除抽緊銀根之外，並由經檢當局出動全體人員，全日監視各主要市塲。（二）生活指數上漲八九成，對華股行情有不利影響，同時廠家發薪，需大量頭寸，頗多拋出物資，供給者多，影響一般物價。（三）利空消息頻傳，內中不乏謠霄。例如司徒大使及邵力子之奉召赴牯，和謠因之重興；而當局對新經濟方案硏討之審愼週詳，持重不發，使一般投機商人認爲可能內中有激烈措施，爲之深具戒心，此點與市塲心理，亦極有影響。</p>

<p>晨開永紗一五五〇〇元，較上週末又低四〇〇元，脚地頗虛，一五四號一五三號二二五號一七〇號來乘頽微納，始見升至一五八〇〇元，然曇花一現，好景不常，旣乏大戶維持，散戶亦多了精，賣風旣濃，八三號一九六號一八〇號一六四號六五號二二四號一七六號一二號五五號俱出，逐步下降至一五二〇〇元，浮空逢低有納，多方乘勢掙扎，數度起仆，又回升至，一五四〇〇元。祗以銀根更緊，證劵帮有出無進，浮多恐懼了結，七八號六五號二二四號一九七號二二〇號及匯粟帮等力售，行市急降至一五一五〇元之低價。更以圈外物價普跌，賣多買少，遂致一蹶不振。臨收以一九七號七一號五五號來進，永紗以一五二八〇元收市，小熱股因一般散戶紛紛脫手，賣氣甚濃，行市下降尤速，景福新光一度盤入九〇元及一四〇元關內，再後各以八八元三三七元結束，結果計跌半成强，中水跌停。惟信誼有增資消息，搜求有人，而獨現紅色。永紗及其他各股均挫半成或微降不等。</p>
<p>午後永紗以一五五〇〇元上市，八九號來進見一五六〇〇元，一九六號三一九號五四號二三〇號見高俗有售，乃下挫至一五四八〇元。浮空有補，紗布再度回升，有利　風，一八七號六五號二〇〇號二二號一八三號一七八號五五號三〇號逢低吸納，更以新多漸漸下手而升至一五八〇〇元，中度雖由二二四號二一六號五四號賣至一五六三〇元，祗以國行差出四萬餘億，銀根稍鬆，人心好轉。夜報消息，有助買氣，市勢由軟轉堅，一七八號一八七號一五二號一五六號四七號一六九號相繼力吸，高見一五九〇〇元。惟浮多獲利了結，一九〇號六五號六一號一五四號二二四號一六九再售，永紗以一五七〇〇元收盤，結果計信誼仍爲漲停，永紗俱見微升，塲外未上市各股票均規秀色。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>因連日上漲過度，銀行帮吐售而見下挫，統丙晨開二一八萬元，六一四室五五二室五五〇室乘跌吸納，高達二三〇萬元，惟五〇〇室五〇三室三六〇室有售，承德並代銀行帮吐售，逐步下挫至二〇六萬元結束，成交約四五百萬？結果計丙種跌二〇萬元，甲乙權小二三萬元，丁戊種亦下降八萬元及十一萬元。</p>
<h3>香港又頌新令　限制英鎊匯款</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港十五日電〕香港現又頒布新法令，限制香港與英鎊地區之英鎊往來。自星期日起，香港與英鎊地區間之英鎊匯款，均以五百鎊爲限。但用於：（一）善意的進口及出；（二）償付保險費，（三）必要的旅行費用，（四）紅利及利息之付給者，不在此限？（按舊法令僅限制香港與倫敦間之匯款。）</p>
<h3>僑匯收入遞增</h3>
<p>上月份將達三千億</p>
<p>中國銀行負責人談稱，自結匯證明書價格逐次機動調整後，各地僑匯收入已較前增加，五月份在結匯證明書價未實行僑匯收入總數僅二百七十八億，六月份採用結匯證明書辦法後，即增至二千五百十六億，七月份之收入總數尙在結算中，預計可增至三千億以上。最近各地匯回國內之僑匯，以菲律濱及南洋等地佔數最多。除匯率調整以外，幷調整國內匯率，以吸收僑匯。目前各地僑匯若由民信局匯滬，再由滬匯往廈門廣州等地時，匯水極高，一千萬元匯至各該地區，僅能收得六百萬元。如由中國銀行轉匯至各該地區時，則不取任何匯水，一千萬元匯往，仍可取得一千萬元，如此對僑胞裨益甚多，故僑匯可能續有增加云。</p>
<h3>金管局飭各行荘　設立轉帳日記帳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金管局迭據各檢査人員報吿，各銀錢行莊及信託公司對轉帳日記帳，多未設立；或雖有帳簿而記載不淸，均屬不合，茲悉金管局已令知本市　錢信託三公會　飭各行莊公司，自即日起應進　統一會計辦法，必須設立轉臘日記帳，並須詳實記載，以便　　，違則嚴懲。</p>
<h3>銀根先緊後弛　行局大量差出</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀根，先緊後弛。四行二局一庫於銀錢業票據交換中，又吿大量差出，總額共達四一五〇穴億之鉅。就中以中央銀行之六六一三四億差出爲數最鉅，中國銀行則整選七四四二億，交通銀行　進六一八〇億，農民銀行整進一〇四八七億，中信局差進七五一三億，郵匯局差出三四八七億，中央合作金庫差出三〇九二億·商業行莊大交換差進二九六五六億，小交換差出一三九九〇健，外商銀行共計差進二五八四〇意。據中央銀行方面消息，該行昨日之鉅額差出大部係繳付收購結匯體明書及匯兌付款所致云。</p>
<h3>客銷呆滯多頭吐售　棉紗布一致挫跌　紗管會昨起停止拋紗</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以行局銀根抽緊，暗息高升，棉布與股票俱降，人心轉疲，買戶咸抱觀望，客化呆滯，多頭紛起吐售。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，晨開即見狂瀉二億八千萬元，嗣因紡建公司懸牌後降，廠商有供，市盤步挫五千萬元，中途倐升倐降，後以二十九億元現出，三十億明日出結束，此週末續跌三億三千萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，亦均步小一二億左右，成交五十八件。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因銀根續緊，當局復有限制華北匯款之措置，北帮吐售，散戶斬結亦多，染廠與本街進胃停滯，實銷不動，人心益虛，</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開即挫五百八十萬元，中途雖曾回上，終以七千六百八十萬元站住，較上週末續跌八百萬元。</p>
<p>其他各細布嗶嘰粗細斜等，亦都疾退，惟色布士林布脚地較硬，成交三千零二十疋。</p>
<p>又訊：收後聞紗股兩市轉穩，龍頭細布喊高至七千七百五十萬，午後在經警嚴監下，喊做更形詭秘，交易甚稀。龍頭細布再自七千九百萬升叩八千萬大關，較上午盤俏三百二十萬元。四君子嗶嘰亦好三百五十萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：紗管會已於昨日起停止拋售紗布，全部拋紗工作，委由中紡執行，惟昨日因紗市跌落甚鉅，故向中紡申購者並不踴躍。中紡前後共拋紗二次，前次拋售六六〇件（合廿支紗），共收縮通貨八，五六八億。後收共加配三三九件，共收縮通貨六，一〇五億。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海宙輪，自滬出口，裝有紗布四千餘件運往仰光，係外銷委員會報運。又紗布一千七百餘件，運香港。</p>
<h3>無錫報價猛降　食米昨見下挫　粉糧油餅行市均勁跌</h3>
<p>米市從高峯下墜，因銀根抽緊，及無錫報價猛降，人心頗虛，貨主售心頓濃，南市塲初降三四百萬，中市最虛，曾降四五百萬，收市略活，終降約三四百萬元。惟高貨僅削一二百萬，北市塲白粳退進六千萬關內，早薄稻均降約四百萬，特高因貨稀仍開六千六百萬，略削百萬而已。昨南北二市到貨共六千二百石。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>急遽回降，銀根之突緊，爲主要原因，其他物價之一致下游，使貨主爭先求職，價格直綫下降。老車粉由二千二百三十萬開後，更步退至二千一百五十萬，計降一百九十萬。兵船二千〇五十萬，則挫二百二十萬。紅蜂及建成各降二百三十萬，均達一成光景。雜牌粉一致削二百萬，大包麩皮跌一百一二十萬，麩皮廠方吃價二千八百萬，貨主不售，故未開出。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>全面下落，銀根吿緊，客帮納胃减少，業外各物俱降，人心虛疲，貨主售股。黃豆終跌二三百萬元，蠶豆交易零星，價挫二百萬。苞米新貨到滬漸多，隆落三百萬，元麥汕帮歇手，北帮取而不多，猛挫五百萬，菉豆無實銷，回落四五百萬元，芝蔴津帮不納，本街稍有做開，降四五百萬。生仁回降八九百萬元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>勁跌，在銀根之突吿抽緊下，執貨者迫於頭寸，求脫甚多，油廠亦有開出，人心虛疲，價格爽落一成。豆油初爲一四五〇〇萬，中途曾稍回高爲一四八〇〇萬，終仍以開盤之價收市，計降一千四百萬元。生菜油收市一二七〇〇萬，亦降一成，吉桶生油及小車蔴油，各見下降一千五百萬元。豆餅客帮不取，實銷全無，市驟降三百三四十萬元。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>
<p>無錫</p>
<p>〔本報無錫十六日電〕十六日央行分行開幕，銀根依然緊俏，物價趨勢萎靡，常在低檔徘徊。白粳五五三六萬，白元五四三六萬，羊秈五五八六萬，埠秈五五三六萬，小麥四九〇〇萬，白麥五二五〇萬，麥粉二〇五〇萬，荳油一三七〇〇萬，棉紗二一三〇〇〇萬。</p>

<p>〔本報蘇州十六日電〕此間今日米價正漲回跌，市塲做開糙粳五一〇〇萬元，白粳五七五〇萬元，門售限價米五七九〇萬元，較上日跌二百萬元。</p>
<p>鎭江</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江十六日電〕日來銀根轉緊，鎭物價今除食米仍站原盤外，餘飾金麵粉五洋棉紗等均趨下游。</p>
<p>南通</p>
<p>〔本報南通十六日電〕銀根緊，物價跌。棉紗供過於求，晨市紅魁跌至五四〇〇萬，下午繼跌至五二〇〇萬，米價漲，白粳六七〇〇萬。</p>

<h3>雨中足球戰　敗於地耳其　世運足球隊慘敗記</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　鍾震</p>
<p>〔本報倫敦航訊〕今天八月二日（星期一）是英國行的休假日，倫敦所有各機關和大店舖都一律停止辦公，可是在四郊各處舉行的世界運動會的節目，並未間斷，照常舉行。</p>
<p>今日天氣，自早晨起就陰沈像下雨似的，果然不出所料，在下午三時半，從溫勃萊皇家游泳池觀畢男子八百米接力賽出門時，即開始下陣雨，冒雨趕往田徑塲去看男子四百米的決賽和撑高跳的拔選。待完畢後復匆匆搭車去倫敦郊外的華爾島司托夫（Walthamstow）足球塲，觀看吾國足球隊首次與土耳其隊交鋒。下午九時在哈林蓋健身房，尙有吾國籃球隊與比利時隊作首次循環賽。所以整個下午，在大雨滂沱中，奔走往返倫敦市各大運動塲，甚覺身心疲乏。</p>
<p>大雨傾盆　體力不支</p>
<p>下午六時半，吾國中華足球隊首次與土耳其隊交鋒於倫敦華爾島司托未足球塲，雖大雨傾盆，觀衆依然非常擁擠，南北二看臺全吿客滿。我國旅英僑胞，十九前來捧塲，奈夭時不佳，比賽時陣雨如注？塲濕泥滑，使諸隊員的攻勢，大受影響，加之體力不支，球運不佳，下半時形成一面倒，素爲國外觀衆重視的中華足球隊，終於不能打破鴨蛋，遭空前慘敗。茲將吾軍陣容，比賽經過，記錄如次；</p>
<p>中華隊陣容</p>
<p>張邦綸</p>
<p>嚴士鑫　侯榕生</p>
<p>劉松生　宋靈聖　郝榕生</p>
<p>李大輝　謝文良　朱永強　張金海　何應芬</p>
<p>五分鐘內　先失一球</p>
<p>六時半正，樂隊首先農奏中華民國國歌，全體觀衆肅立致敬，次奏土耳其國歌，旋即舉行開球禮。裁判員銀笛一吹，土耳其隊馬蹄疾走，挾着銳勢，直向中華隊球門進犯。吾軍急起招架，迫成角球，土耳其隊右翼一脚勁射，中鋒肯狄一頭頂去，飛入球門左上角，應聲破綱，張邦綸欲救乏術，在不到五分鐘，土耳其不費吹灰之力，以一比〇佔先。以後吾國球隊，奮力反攻，終因土耳其二衛，守備　密，未能得手，球入吾軍之手，往往因塲地濕滑，奔跑不易，失去良好機會。前鋒及翼，動作均較緩慢，與土耳其之迅速善長跑，簡直不可相比。上半時，土耳其攻勢　利，險救屢屢，終於在守門張邦綸急救之下，化險爲夷。在極度驚險的波濤中，以一比〇結束上半時。在兩軍酣戰時，在南看台上有吾國在英海軍一隊約數十人，組織啦啦隊，協力助威，同時土耳其也有一啦啦隊，在塲外互相對抗。</p>
<p>一連三球　大勢去矣</p>
<p>休息十分鐘後，下半時開始，雨勢依舊不小，球員涉水作戰，精神可嘉。十分鐘後，中鋒朱永强，奮力遙射，打中門楣，僅差毫厘，可惜之至。此後吾軍屢次射門，均被土耳其隊守門救出。於是中華隊漸見力竭，在七時四十分鐘時，中鋒朱永强右膝被踢傷，無法行動因此出塲。吾軍元氣大傷，無力反抗。土耳其隊遂即乘隙以閃電姿態，猛舉進攻。中鋒肯狄在十二碼內竄入射門，祗見一下斜射，砰然入網，成二比〇。不到二分鐘，土耳其攻勢更形銳利，大軍長驅入內，左翼濟慮翻身怒掃，又應聲破綱，成三比〇。是時土耳其聲勢大盛，右前衛單槍匹馬，衝入禁衛之地遙射，又被進一球，成四比〇。在此五分鐘時間內，土耳其暹　三球，局勢大　。中蘿隊終因大勢已去，無法挽救，在九人努力維持之下，草草終尋。購雨前來數百僑胞，募不嗟　而散。此次失敗最大原因，除天雨及球運不佳外，吾國是球隊員在體魄氣力速率上，實遠不及土耳其，以致造成〇比四的慘敗。戰畢後由美前來之陳立夫先生曾親臨球員休息室慰問，使諸隊員頗爲感激。</p>
<h3>中青排球賽　永紗獲冠軍</h3>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>自來水與房捐</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>七月份自來水賬單送來了，一看是一千五百餘萬元，較大月份竟增加近十倍，最初猶不信，恐係弄錯，經訊問結果，謂六月份之所以僅一百五十餘萬元者，因上次加價恰在抄表後一日算起，故搨了一次便宜貨。此次舊欠斬資　來，遂一躍爲十倍。不過無論怎樣解釋，一千五百萬元一月的水費，在一個薪水階級人物，終是一大支出，而且將來一加再加，尙無止境可言。</p>
<p>然而反觀同時寄來的夏季房捐單，連市政建設捐一起在內，竟祗五萬一千元，此數恐尙不敷三聯房捐單加上一隻大信封的紙張與印工的成本，更不必說一張房捐單所耗的許多人力了。如此捐稅而謂能裕國庫，豈非等於開玩笑。</p>
<p>我這樣說，並非表示在付了高價的水電費外，更自願付高價的房捐，祗是覺得當局者措置的不合理，實已到了可驚的程度。水電等公用事業最近幾乎每月在增加收費，且其標準已遠超過生沽指數甚至物價指數。爲甚麼一樣在中國經營商業，外商職員就必須以美金支薪？外商公用事業以及一部市營公用事業動不動藉口他們所用的五金材料，燃料等漲價，所以不得不漲。然而我們知道上海最大的五金商與燃料商是洋商。他們都是賺得翻到了。</p>
<p>例如某某幾家洋商油公司，因數年來在中國賺得的本利無法全部匯回其國內，便在上海大量搜購地產，我們在南京東路，中正東路，林森西路等最繁盛的商業區住宅區，就可看到很多佔地基廣的加油站。這些區械的地皮都以數百十根金條計算，故其總代價之巨可以推想。則五金燃料等之漲，雖使公用事業受其影饗，不過賺錢的仍舊是他們自己人</p>
<p>所以公用事業即使虧本，亦應另籌補救之道，不應該一味在大衆頭上剝削打算，而且上海的幾大公用事業究竟虧蝕到如何程度，外人亦無從知道。以外籍高級職員月得數十百億的待遇言，則除一味加價之外，略事節省內部的浪費與開支，亦不失是補救之策。然而即使是現在的待遇，外商職員還在鳴不平呢！</p>
<p>然而反顧市政收入，則不僅跟不上公用事業的「飛躍」，且尙不能追及一般生活指數，如房捐便是一例。據說戰前平均繳納相當一百美金的房捐，至今祗在一百五十萬元國幣左右，即僅及戰前百分之一强。他如汽車牌照稅等情形亦然。換言之，愈是有錢人，其所納稅捐的比率愈少。可是其他區域的馬路可以幾年不修，衛生環境可以置之不問，獨有高等住宅區的幾條馬路，則仍非保持相當整潔光滑不可。所謂國際觀臨有關，就是如此那麽一回事。</p>
<p>因爲捐得起而應該捎的人不肯捎，當局者也「不便」向他們身上去捐，致使今日上海的市政陷於一籌莫展。市政建設且不談，甚至連員工的薪金都曾發生問題，以全國首富著稱的上海市，於上月間竟不得不請求中央緊急補助，始得　度難關。</p>
<p>我認爲現在有許多人批評政府腐敗，固有不可否認之處，但若說政府對於人民的錢囊貪得無饜，則就有語病。因爲就目前各級政府機關的施策觀察，至少對於有錢人絕無貪得之處，像過去的外匯政策，計　中的出售國營事業，實行起來，恐怕倒是便宜了若干豪門而已！</p>
<p>因爲政府太顧到少數富人的利益，於是一切雖有益大衆但對富人略有不利的措置，便無一能被順利通過。財產稅尙未成議，引起的抗議不少。救濟特捐軟硬兼施，結果「顏料大王」所捐猶不到「小黃魚」一隻！</p>
<p>我以爲如果市政當局確有爲大衆市民謀福利的決心，對於應該加，可以加的捐挽，應予堂皇提出，不必顧忌反對。增加捐稅，雖然是大衆聽不進的事，然凡事須求其合理。物價可以一月漲數倍，公用事業可以一次漲四五倍，則讓正當的稅收遠落於後，那就不合理。我並不主張捐稅應與物便競爭，但認爲對隨物價高漲而獲得利益的人們，應通過捐稅的方式，將他們一部份的利得還諸社會。例如特別提高甲乙級房屋的房捐，增加自備汽車牌照稅，重新估定營業稅的基準等。</p>
<p>市政當局祗要能認眞做到取之於民，用之於民，就一定會得民衆的支持。</p>
<h3>紫氣東來</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>「紫氣東來」爲老子出關故事，爲人所周知，關令尹內傳云：「關令登樓四望，見東極有紫氣西邁，喜曰：『應有聖人經過京邑。』至期乃齋戒，其日果見老子。「所以杜工部詩亦有「東來紫氣滿函關」之句。列異傳云：「老子西遊，關令尹喜望見其有紫氣浮關，而老子果乘靑牛而過。一史記老莊申韓列傳云：「老子修道德，其學以自隱無名爲務，居周久之，見周之　，乃遂去至關，關令尹喜曰：『子將隱矣，疆爲我著書。』於是老子乃著書上下篇，言道德之意五千餘言而去，莫知其所終。」</p>
<p>老子之有無，固成問題，老子之時代，亦聚訟紛紜，莫衷一是。前人多信爲與孔子並時而較早，近人據道德經之內容，多斷爲戰國時代。老子自始即爲撲朔迷離，不可捉摸之人物，後人加以神話式之敷會，道士又奉爲始祖，尊爲太上老君，於是老子更成爲神聖不可侵犯之人物。「紫氣東來」亦成中國人物畫中一普通之畫題。</p>
<p>畫人物難，畫故實更難。畫人物可以不受時代之限制，畫故實則必須受時代之限制，表明時代最顯著之物，厥爲衣冠服飾舟車房屋棹椅陳設等物，因爲此等物件，因時代不同而變化甚多，若考證不詳，易致謬誤，所畫之人必致宋履唐冠，晋衣漢裳，萃千古於一身，冶歷代於一爐，非驢非馬，爲有識者所竊笑。畫故實不特注意時代，仍須注意地域，南北不同，風土亦異，若不經心，不免移塞北之景於粤南，揚東海之波於流沙。此弊不自今始雖古大家亦所不免，唐張彥遠已論之甚詳，歷代名畫記云：「若論衣服車輿，土風人物，年代各異，南北有殊。觀畫之宜，在乎詳審。只如吳道子畫仲由，便戴木劍。　令公畫昭君，已著幃指。殊不知木劍創於晋代　韓帽與於國朝。舉此凡例，亦畫之一病也。且如幅巾傳於漢魏，衆離起自齊隋，　頭始於周朝，巾子創於武德。胡服靴衫，豈可輒施於古象？衣冠組綬，不宜長用於今人。芒屬非塞北所宜，牛車非嶺南所有。詳辨古今之物，商較土風之宜，指事繪形，可驗時代。」</p>
<p>「指事繪形，可驗時代」，與近代畫壞所主張之「藝術爲時代之反映」，若合符節。若執「時代」「地域」兩種標準，以評歷代人物故實畫，恐完美不謬者，千不得一。其詳不　具論，即以「紫氣東來」一畫題論之。據筆者所見，其時代地域，無不陷於謬誤。據近人考證所斷定，老子至晚亦係戰國時代，戰國時代之衣冠究爲何狀，實難考證，早已無法定其是非，但近人所畫除衣冠外，顯然謬誤甚多。普通所畫多爲一白鬚老人，騎在水牛上，後隨一童子，手棒綫裝書一套。不知中原並無水牛，老子所騎靑牛乃上海人所謂黃牛（黃牛有黃色靑色及黑白花三種）。至於綫裝書宋代以後始有，戰國尙在「削竹簡」時代，何來此整套之綫裝書？近觀徐悲鴻先生畫展，亦有「紫氣東來」，所畫仍爲水牛，老子手中執一卷子，此雖較綫裝書提早數百年，然仍爲漢唐之物，而非戰國所有。且據史記所載，是關令尹强老子著書，老子始著道德經，並非在出關以前，書已著畢，則老子手中似不應有未著之書。悲鴻畫名滿天下，不免有吳道子畫木劍，閻令公畫幃帽之失，其他更無論矣！於以見人物故實之難畫，而作者之所以日少也。</p>
<h3>茶會</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>茶話會簡稱茶會，今極流行。語其大者，國際酬酢，使節雲集，握手聯歡，佐以跳舞，歐美各國，無不重視。考之我國，古亦已有之。茶董裏載錢起字仲文，與趙莒「茶宴」；又常過孫宅與郞上人作「茶會」。不過這茶會是眞正名副其實的茶會，因爲所「宴」，所「會」，無非是品「茶」，與西俗的性質異。</p>
<p>上海之有茶會，動國際間之視聽者，始於公元一八九七年，即亡淸光緒二十三年。那年農歷十月初十日是那拉后生日，上海道蔡鈞特於是晚仿西例，邀請茶會。各國西人到者，男女千人，雖香港漢口西商，亦來赴會，蓋西人好奇，因中國始創茶會，故皆以赴會爲榮。當初擬請茶會時，担文律師爲鈞曰：「聞貴道請茶會，開中國風氣，我西人聞之，非常欣喜！」是晚工部局董事爲鈞曰：「貴道開此風氣，且布置華麗周密，即歐美最講究之大茶會亦不過如是。請此茶會，尤勝中國連捷勝仗，使各國人見之，亦知中國尙有人在也。」載蔡鈞所著之「外交辯難」中。是日盛况，想本報資料室中必有詳情可査。按那時官吏素極守舊，蔡鈞曾遍遊全球，腦筋新穎，特仿西例邀請茶會，自無怪値得西人驚歏了。</p>
<p>上海之有第二次盛大茶會，是在戊戌政變之年農歷四月初一日。那時德國亨利親王遊歷中國，所過之處，要中國地方官恭備黃轎親迎！這事由蔡鈞力爭而罷。蔡代表淸廷，邀請茶會，據外交辯難中記云：「四月朔日，請茶會。男女到者六百餘人。亨利親王異常歡喜。蓋茶會跳舞，爲歐美最重」云云。</p>
<h3>官塲異聞</h3>
<p>— 林</p>
<p>印度有一小邦名喀什米爾，面積雖小，地位頗爲重要，是以前印回衝夾極劇烈的一個地方。那位國君却性好隱逸，不問政事，全部國家要公都聽任羣臣自作主張。有一位美國新聞記者曾發現過一位稅務官員，以一身兼七職之多，而七個差使都極空閑，簡直無事可做，那位先生便在自己的辦公廳中放了七只寫字檯，天天在這七只檯子上轉來轉去，自己批自己呈給自已的呈文，藉資消遣。</p>
<h3>鄧散木先生詩稿</h3>
<h3>蘋姐的錶</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>讀陳家驊先生著的短篇小說集童年與錶，從第一篇房東太太到第七篇女傭，只覺得是材料豐富，寫得樸實，讀了末後的一篇「童年與錶」，我不禁深深的感動了。這一篇是自傳體，所寫的故事是，作者十二三歲的時候，因爲沈醉於封神榜和七俠五義等荒唐書籍，弄得神經失了常，搜，臉黃，眼黑，夜溺，絕食，怕鬼，不敢隨便走動。由於家人的愛護，找得蘋姐來陪伴他，當時她十五歲，「二根小辮子，花鞋，眼珠圓溜溜的。」於是一道讀書，她講故事給他聽，晚上同到田野去散步；不但友伴，她還做了他的老師，他的保姆。她會唱歌，又寫得一手好字。神經失常以後，他膽小，憎恨夜晚，厭惡月亮，怕見閃爍着的星星，但有了蘋姐在一起，他也就喜歡月亮，愛見滿天星斗了。不久病好了，她就回去，不過時常來看他。後來她已長大，要出嫁了，又到他的家裏來住一個月，直到嫁期已屆，被催回去的前夜，她送他一隻錶，文中這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「那是一個月夜，我剛在園子裏散步，她迅急把錶遞給了我，恐怕人看見似的：『好好的藏着，不要走失，益，好好的。」</p>
<p>接着這樣寫：</p>
<p>「那晚月色很淸麗，我接了錢，沒有立刻走開，她的面部的表情，很不平常。……我偸看着她，她的神情仍很激動，彷彿想哭似的。」</p>
<p>十年了，如今錶還在唧唧的走響，這是她的心聲，兩性之間，由於憐憫而表深切同情的是眞正的愛。她救護他，他得救了，這是她的功績。對於自己辛苦造成的事物，當然也是心愛的。文中又有這樣的一段：</p>
<p>「我執抝的性格，什麽人都奈何我不得，但只蘋姐，她一句話，我什麼都依順。我信任她。一這是愛的力量。已經心心相印，他們不能結成佳偶，是爲社會條件所阻礙的。可是愛情關不住，一隻錶在月下移送了，唧唧唧，代表着她的心聲。——這是眞情的流露。唧唧唧，當然很動聽。我不曾見過那隻錶，沒有親耳聽到聲音，只是我從文字上看看，也很感動，這是寫作的成功。</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 16th] President Chiang hosted a luncheon banquet at his official residence in Guling on the 16th for important officials who came to Guling. Among those who attended were Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Acting Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Committee Long Yun, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee Chen Bulei, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of Jiangxi Province Hu Jiafeng, and Chairman of the National Socialist Party Zhang Junmai.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 16th] The President and his wife invited Chinese and foreign dignitaries in Guling to a picnic at Tianchi Temple on the evening of the 16th. Among those who participated were Ambassador Stuart, Advisor Brewster, General and Mrs. Berge, President Sun Ke, Vice Minister Zheng Jiemin, Military Attache Chen Shulin, Secretary You Jianwen, and Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party Zhang Junmai, totaling more than ten people. The group set off separately at around 6 p.m. After arriving at Dalin Road, they abandoned their vehicles and walked. At 7:15 p.m., they arrived at the Buddha's Hand Rock. The First Lady, along with the Ambassador and the Berge couple, went ahead, while the President, Sun Ke, and others followed behind. The First Lady and her group went from Buddha's Hand Rock to Fairy Cave. After the President arrived, he decided not to visit further due to the late hour. Instead, they boarded their vehicles and went directly to Tianchi Temple, arriving at 5:30 p.m. Zhang Junmai had already arrived and was waiting. At that time, mist rose from the mountains, enveloping the entire mountain. After about ten minutes, it cleared, and the setting sun shone obliquely, with colorful clouds covering the sky. Looking north from Tianchi Temple, the mountains, rivers, plains, and fields stretched as far as the eye could see. Clouds floated in the air, creating a spectacular view. The President, his wife, and the Chinese and foreign dignitaries gazed at the scene for a long time before starting their picnic. They chatted and laughed during the meal, and it was not until 8:30 p.m. that they returned in high spirits. Ambassador Stuart, Advisor Brewster, General and Mrs. Berge are scheduled to descend the mountain at 8 a.m. on the 17th and go to Shili Shop, where they will take a special plane back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 16th] The President and his wife are still very interested in sightseeing. On the evening of the 16th, they invited Ambassador Stuart, the Berge couple, and others to visit Tianchi Temple and have a picnic. Tianchi Temple was built during the Jiading period of the Song Dynasty. It suffered from the disasters of war during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, so it remains dilapidated and desolate to this day. The temple has Tianchi Spring, whose water flows continuously. To the west of Tianchi Temple is Wenshu Terrace, which can be climbed to look down, with distant waves flickering, green shadows, and red clouds, making for extremely beautiful scenery. When the President and his party arrived, the temple monk Shi Dazheng came out to greet them. The President earnestly inquired about repairing the temple buildings, showing great concern.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 16th] Zhang Jia'ao arrived in Guling at noon on the 16th from Shanghai via Nanchang on a China National Aviation Corporation plane. He will meet with the President to report on matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Jia'ao flew to Nanchang yesterday and then transferred to Guling. According to sources close to Zhang, he made this trip because Shanghai is suffering from intense summer heat and crop failures, while Lushan is cooler and suitable for rest. Zhang brought many books with him, planning to spend his leisure time in the mountains reading.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 16th] Vice Minister of National Defense Zheng Jiemin arrived in Guling in the afternoon of the 16th from Nanjing via Nanchang.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 16th] Vice President Li is scheduled to return to Nanjing by special plane on the 17th. President Chiang telegraphed Li last night from Guling, urging him to come to Guling, and said that if it was inconvenient to find a plane, he could send a special plane from Nanjing. Li replied that he would fly to Nanjing on the 17th and already had a special plane, so there was no need to send another one. After arriving in Nanjing, Li will transfer to Guling.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 15th] The mobile large corps of the National Army advancing south along the Ping-Bao Line has been encircling and suppressing the remnants of bandits in the Laishui, Yi County, Dingxing, and Beihe areas for days. The fighting is extremely fierce. The sound of artillery can be faintly heard outside Baoding. The remnants of the 6th and 7th bandit columns, etc., entrenched on both sides of the railway south of the Beihe River, are in disarray and showing signs of wavering, busily preparing to flee. Restoring traffic on the entire Ping-Bao Line is just around the corner.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 16th] The temporary line of Bridge No. 54 between Tangshan and Yushu on the Beining Railway was washed out by a minor flood on the 10th, and was repaired and reopened to traffic on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 16th] The North China剿匪總司令部 announced: Yesterday afternoon, the National Army in eastern Chahar Province conducted a powerful search southeast of Zhao Chuanpu (east of Xuanhua), and engaged in a fierce battle with 500 bandits in Liugou Village. Later, another 900 bandits fled from the east. The National Army immediately divided its forces to outflank and strike.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 16th] The 7th and 4th bandit columns and a part of the 2nd bandit column have now arrived in the area of Jiudu River east of Yongningpu.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Guihua, 16th] The number of bandits in Zuoyun has increased. The guards at the city gate are strict, prohibiting residents from leaving the city. Carpenters in the city are concentrated to build scaling ladders, with the intention of attacking Datong.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Recaptures Siyang; Bandit Troops Harass Area Between Jingjiang and Zhang Huanggang, Suffering Heavy Blows</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 16th] Military News: The National Army in northern Jiangsu, in coordination with local teams, recaptured Siyang County on the 14th.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Jiangyin, 16th] Jingjiang News: Important strongholds such as Bahuzhuang and Niutouzhuang between Ji (Jiashi) and Huang (Zhang Huanggang) on the Jing-Huang Highway were fiercely attacked by six companies of bandit Jingtai Independent Regiment special agents. After ten hours of coordinated attacks from north and south by the National Army's Miao Brigade and local teams, most of the bandits were annihilated. The main force of the bandits is still lurking nearby. The highest military authorities are paying close attention to this and have sent teams to reinforce, as well as dispatching air force to scout the battle situation, in order to remove the threat to Jingtai.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 15th] A medium-sized vehicle of the Jiangdu Xin Su Automobile Company, registration number "080319," was ambushed by more than 100 bandits near Baita River while en route to Tai County at around 10 a.m. on the 15th. Two passengers were injured.</p>
<h3>Bandit Occupation of Bo-Huan Border Region; Serious Locust Plague Occurs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] A serious locust plague is occurring in the Bo-Xing and Huantai border region under bandit occupation. The farmland in the area has been devoured. The local bandit army is not taking action to eliminate the locusts, and the farmers are also unable to attend to it because they participate in "struggle sessions and review meetings" every day, so the disaster area is expanding.</p>
<h3>Sichuan's Outer Defenses Strengthened; Bandit Gangs Harass Western Sichuan, National Army Rushes to Suppress</h3>

<h3>"Facing the Soviet Union": Report by the U.S. Foreign Policy Association Says U.S. Does Not Want to Aid China with Military Supplies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] A report by the Foreign Policy Association states: "The United States is not very willing to aid the Chinese government with a large amount of military supplies" because it fears that "the Soviet Union will supply the Chinese Communists with the same or even more military supplies." The report is titled "Facing the Soviet Union" and was written by Columbia University professor of international relations and advisor to the U.S. delegation at the Potsdam Conference, Mr. Marsh Lai. He said: "In China, both the United States and the Soviet Union are carefully avoiding direct confrontation. No matter how strong the Soviet Union is, the risks and costs for Europe are greater than for the Soviet Union." The report states that the Soviet Union had demanded that Japan be forced to surrender to the American and Soviet allied forces, but was rejected by the United States. Later, it also requested that the United States and the Soviet Union jointly administer Japan, but was also rejected by the United States.</p>
<p>A Piece of Diplomatic History</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh's report states that after the Soviet Union's two requests were rejected, Molotov obstructed the work of concluding treaties with Germany's satellite countries at the London Foreign Ministers Conference in 1946, causing it to come to a halt. Later, Molotov proposed discussing the Japanese issue, which was accepted. Mr. Marsh pointed out that three months after the Second London Conference, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to establish the Far Eastern Commission and the Tokyo Far East Tribunal to determine the policy of occupying Japan. Mr. Marsh added that at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, Stalin said that the Soviet Union could not allow free elections in Eastern European countries after the war, because this would produce "anti-Soviet" policies.</p>
<p>Summarizing the Soviet Union's various activities in the Far East, Mr. Marsh said: The United States believes that "a friendly Japan is a necessary condition for the United States' security in the Pacific." However, from the Soviet Union's perspective, it is suspicious of this new expansion of the United States. Mr. Marsh said: The Soviet Union "firmly refused" to conclude a treaty with Japan according to the conditions proposed by the United States. The draft proposed by the United States did not include a veto. He also said: "However, in the future, the United States may make peace with Japan alone, and the Soviet Union and Japan will still be at war." Mr. Marsh did not speculate further on this.</p>
<p>Referring to the Korean issue, Mr. Marsh said: The Soviet Union has so far shown no intention of loosening its control over the north. He said: "This is their policy, hoping that due to indefinite delays, they can stay longer than the American occupation forces."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union May Compromise</p>
<p>Although Mr. Marsh believes that there is currently no basis for coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union on disputes, he said that it would be a huge mistake to think that "all negotiations will be fruitless" because of this. He said: "Some problems cannot be solved or improved until the situation of power and politics is clear." Mr. Marsh said: The Soviet Union may temporarily show compromise, and "the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union will disappear." He also said: From 1917 to 1921, Soviet leaders believed that war and failure had created "an opportunity for a Communist revolution, especially in France." This revolutionary climax allowed capitalism to achieve temporary stability in the 1920s. However, "Soviet communist doctrine continued to predict a 'second war and revolution.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh said: Since 1946, the Soviet Union has indeed gained "the greatest advantage" in this "second" war. But now it can be considered to have passed, and another "balance" period has begun. If they are going to take any action, it will be to adopt a more compromising attitude towards the United States.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Commission Passes New Bill: All Japanese Loot Must Be Returned; Stipulates Application Must Be Made Quickly Within Eight Months; Eleven-Nation Representatives Form Committee to Advise Allied Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] Diplomatic circles: Regarding the return of materials looted by Japan from the occupied areas of various Allied countries during the war, the Far Eastern Commission passed a new resolution at the end of July this year. The discussion of this new case took a long time, starting as early as June 1936 and only recently being completed. The new resolution has many improvements compared to the old case passed by the Commission in July 1935. The important ones are as follows: (1) All looted goods, regardless of their type or whether they were produced before or after the occupation, must be returned once they are verified. (2) Japanese ships transporting Japanese materials to the receiving countries of the looted goods, if there is spare tonnage when leaving Japan, should conveniently carry the looted goods to that country for return. (3) The cost of salvaging and repairing sunken ships looted within Japanese territorial waters should be entirely borne by the Japanese government and should not be deducted from the compensation account of the receiving country. The costs of the crew driving the looted ships to the original owner's country for return, unless the receiving country is willing, may not be borne. (4) For looted goods that cannot prove their original owner (including gold, silver, and jewelry, but excluding cultural relics), Allied Headquarters should first give representatives of various countries ample opportunity for inspection and identification, so that they can be recognized as much as possible, and then Allied Headquarters should sell them and use the proceeds as a guarantee fund. Allied Headquarters is responsible for managing the fund. During the management period, Allied Headquarters may consider using the fund as a loan guarantee for purposes related to the occupation, but its original value should be preserved by Allied Headquarters and its subordinate institutions. On October 1, 1938, the proceeds from this sale will be distributed to the seven countries that were occupied by Japan - China, the United States, Australia, France, India, New Zealand, and the Philippines - according to the general compensation ratio. These seven countries will have the right of first refusal when selling these looted goods. (5) When there are doubts about the documents submitted by applicants for the return of looted goods, judgment should be made based on legal fairness and common sense to decide whether to return them. (6) Representatives from each of the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission will form a committee in Japan to return looted goods. If there are doubts about the documents submitted for the return of looted goods, and it is uncertain whether the looted goods should be returned or sold as materials for which the original owner cannot be proven, Allied Headquarters should consult the opinions of the committee. Regarding matters related to the return of looted goods, if the opinion of Allied Headquarters differs from that of the majority of the committee representatives, Allied Headquarters should report the committee's opinion to the United States government. (7) Looted goods that have not been applied for in advance, and have therefore been designated as compensation materials, must have already been delivered to the receiving country of the compensation materials before an application for return can be made. (8) Within eight months from the date of the passage of this new resolution, which is transferred to Allied Headquarters by the U.S. government for implementation, countries should quickly apply for the return of looted goods.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Freezing US Aid Funds</h3>
<p>If the funds obtained from the sale of US aid materials are used to cover the deficit in public finances, after paying for various necessary expenses as agreed, some estimate that it can avoid the printing of more than 400 trillion new banknotes. Others estimate that, based on our country's previous issuance amount, this fund can at least offset 50% of the currency issued. In reality, the exchange rate of the legal tender against the US dollar is declining daily, so it is currently difficult to accurately estimate how much this fund will be when converted into legal tender. What is known is that if this fund can be definitively agreed upon for the purpose of covering the fiscal deficit, it will have a decisive effect on balancing the national budget and reducing the issuance of new banknotes, thereby alleviating inflation and achieving the common goal of stabilizing the economy, at least partially.</p>
<p>However, the US seems to emphasize the path of reproduction, that is, to use most of these funds for various production aspects. This is a very proper approach in normal times, because covering government expenses is too passive and cannot directly achieve the purpose of economic development. The reason why various foreign debts have been criticized and why the country's foreign debt has been increasing is due to this problem. The US learns from past mistakes and focuses on reproduction. Although there may be a role in doing more business, in general, developing production undertakings is always beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Moreover, to maintain the national spirit and develop national strength, it is necessary to take this path. However, in this autumn of communist bandits disturbing and flames of war spreading everywhere, it is impossible to talk about economic construction without quickly suppressing the chaos and stabilizing order. Therefore, in a time of malignant inflation and economic turmoil, it is impossible to talk about increasing production without quickly balancing income and expenditure and stabilizing the currency value. Don't we see that the existing industries are still in a precarious situation? Are foreign merchants' businesses in China not facing the same difficulties? Therefore, in principle, we should agree with the US proposal, but we cannot but hope that they will give China another serious consideration on the order of urgency and importance.</p>
<p>As for the so-called freezing of special accounts, its content is not yet clear. According to common sense, once any funds are frozen, they are not allowed to be used during the specified period. Its role is to restrict the owner's immediate use, thereby reducing the number of chips on the market, which will help tighten floating capital and ease inflation. However, the effect of the freeze only extends to the owner of the deposit and not to the bank where it is deposited. Because the bank's responsibility is limited to paying on maturity, without bearing any trust, it does not have the obligation to keep these frozen funds in the vault in full, nor does it have the necessity to reserve sufficient cash of equal value for a long time. Therefore, these funds, although frozen on the depositor's side, can still be used by the bank, and are not actually frozen. In other words, these funds can still be circulated by the bank in the market, and are still a huge amount of floating capital. The so-called recall of legal tender is just empty talk, and has no actual impact. On the contrary, because there is a frozen deposit that is not used for a long time, the bank does not need to increase a huge number of chips that do not need to be paid immediately, and can legally use it to increase its lending capacity and capital for hoarding goods. If this is the case, wouldn't it run counter to the purpose of contracting the currency and suppressing prices? If, after these funds are frozen, the bank must also freeze them in full and is not allowed to use them freely, then the banks will not want to compete for this frozen deposit. It is reasonable to assume that they would not leave their warehouses empty and unwilling to use them, and would rather store this huge amount of banknotes for others!</p>
<p>Some people think that the so-called freezing naturally refers to depositing it in the national treasury, which is equivalent to covering the deficit. We hope that this statement is not empty. Because only by doing so can it help the government balance its finances and reduce issuance; and only by doing so can it alleviate inflation and stabilize the economy. However, instead of using the phrase "transfer to the national treasury," the word "freeze" is used, which does not seem to correspond to the reality. It is hoped that when formally agreed upon, clearer wording will be used to dispel doubts and avoid smuggling under the cover of the word "freeze"!</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Financial and Grain Conference Opens; Dividing into Financial and Tax, and Farmland and Grain Groups, Emphasis on Lectures Rather Than Review; Chen Yi Explains in Detail the Establishment of the Materials Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 16th] The Zhejiang Provincial Financial and Grain Conference opened in Hangzhou on the 16th, with 192 people attending. The main purpose of the conference is to cooperate with the needs of suppressing chaos and building the country, emphasizing lectures rather than review, and dividing into financial and tax, and farmland and grain groups.

<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 16th] Chairman Chen Yi recently explained the Zhejiang Provincial Materials Operation Committee, saying that it is purely to use public capital to manage public enterprises for the happiness of all the people; it is not to use private capital to manage monopolistic enterprises and only seek the benefit of a few people. If government officials use their private capital to run monopolistic enterprises, it is bureaucratic capital, which should not be allowed to exist. Instead, they will create national capital belonging to all the people by running public enterprises. Chen claimed to have firm confidence that the profits obtained in the future will definitely be used to improve the welfare of the people of the province, make their lives more stable and secure, and become more prosperous.</p>

<h3>Malayan Communist Uprising: Overseas Chinese Suffer; Our Telegram to Consul General in Singapore; Negotiating to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Diplomatic circles news: Since the Communist Party uprising in Malaya, a large number of local residents have been brutally killed, and no fewer than 40 of our overseas Chinese compatriots have also been killed.

<h3>Searching for Peking Man; We Request Allied Headquarters Assistance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Our delegation in Japan has requested Allied Headquarters to assist in finding Peking Man, who was taken away by the Japanese in 1941. The head of the Compensation and Restitution Group of our delegation in Japan, Yu Bannong, stated that Peking Man is considered to be a human skull as ancient as Heidelberg Man and Java Man. It was excavated in 1926 in Zhoukoudian, south of Beiping, and preserved in the Peking Union Medical College. In 1941, the authorities of the Peking Union Medical College, with the permission of our government due to the deteriorating situation in China, decided to send Peking Man to the United States for preservation. It was packed into three large boxes and handed over to the US Marines who were evacuating North China on the American President Harrison ship. Unfortunately, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on the same day. The Marines were all captured, and Peking Man mysteriously disappeared. For a long time, Peking Man was forgotten. In 1942, Hikosaburo Hasebe, professor of archeology at Tokyo Imperial University, traveled to Beiping to visit the warehouse of the Peking Union Medical College, only to discover that Peking Man was not inside. The following spring, the Japanese military police conducted an investigation into this case for more than a month, and it was rumored that Peking Man had been discovered in Tianjin. However, it was soon rumored that what was discovered was not Peking Man but deer teeth, and nothing was heard after that. It was not until the end of the war that Dr. Li Qing was sent to search, but with no results. From the various events that have occurred, in order to discover the missing Peking Man, it seems necessary to find the US Marines who accepted the three boxes of Peking Man, the Japanese troops who captured the Marines, and the Japanese troops who occupied the Peking Union Medical College, but this kind of work will require a lot of money and manpower.</p>

<h3>Rebuilding Rural China (Part 2)</h3>
<p>A Conversation with Mr. James Yen</p>
<p>Promoting Self-Defense and Self-Governance Through Organizational Education: The target of organizational education is also the farmers. The aim is twofold: to strengthen rural armed self-defense to protect their hometowns, and to enhance farmers' self-governance as a foundation for exercising political power and implementing constitutional government. The Mass Education Movement had promoted "civic education" in Ding County for many years and had established basic moral standards: (1) great virtue and selflessness, (2) courage and fearlessness, (3) universal love and impartiality, (4) sincerity and genuineness, wisdom and discernment, and many other standards for oneself, others, and the public. When discussing organizational education, Mr. Yen pointed out that in today's era of implementing constitutional government and discussing rural construction and revitalization, organizational education is also about rural self-defense and self-governance, and is closely related to the three aspects of education: literacy, production, and health. Mr. Yen said, "Eloquent articles in newspapers and solemn legislative provisions cannot implement constitutional government. How can we talk about self-defense when people cannot even write their names, are not well-fed, and are weak and dying?" The interdependence of literacy, medicine, production, health, and organization: Mr. Yen further explained that life is an organic whole, and being biased towards any one aspect is unhealthy. Solely focusing on saving the country through agriculture or youth education will not achieve anything in isolation. Mr. Yen elaborated on the interconnected and mutually supportive nature of the four, saying: "Only by being literate can one receive education; only when agriculture and forestry flourish will the people have surplus resources and the mental and physical energy to discuss other things; health can only improve with knowledge and abundance; and only after improvement will there be conditions for engaging in production, education, and organization. And organizational education is the only necessary stage to assist the common people in managing their own affairs." Mr. Yen continued to explain the enlightening role of education itself in rural construction: "Only when people are educated can they automatically and spontaneously improve themselves." However, although the four are interconnected, when implementing them in rural areas, it is permissible to adapt to local conditions and decide which to start with first. In areas where production has declined, one can start with production education; in areas where the people's intelligence is backward, one can start with literacy education. Once started, the four should advance together; the countryside is a whole, and improving rural life should not be piecemeal.</p>
<p>Research and Experimentation and Promotion, in the past, such as the Ding County experimental work of the Mass Education Movement, were all research and experimentation by private academic institutions. Now, the establishment of the Joint Committee for Rural Reconstruction is a promotion from the government's perspective. The Mass Education Movement was initiated in 1923 and experimented in Ding County, Hebei, in 1930, followed by the establishment of institutions in Hengshan and Xindu, Sichuan, to engage in experimentation. The selection of these three locations was aimed at their representativeness in their respective regions, representing the vast areas of North China, Central China, and Southwest China, respectively. Mr. Yen specifically mentioned that during the same period, the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping, Shandong, headed by Mr. Liang Shuming and Mr. Liang Zhonghua, the Jiangsu Education College in Wuxi, Jiangsu, headed by Yu Jian, the Xiaozhuang School in Nanjing and the Baoshan Labor Academy in Shanghai, led by Mr. Tao Xingzhi, as well as educational institutions such as Yenching University, Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University, University of Nanking, West China University, and Nankai University, all made significant contributions to the experimental work of rural construction. Mr. Yen said: "For decades, those engaged in the rural movement have delved into the people, studying methods and systems for cultivating people's power, which is the opposite of scholars locking themselves in rooms to study Western books. It can be said to be a revolutionary trend." Mr. Yen believes that the rural construction movement in China over the past few decades has conducted research and experimentation using scientific methods. Various provinces also had considerable promotion work before and during the war, referring to the Mass Education Movement having engaged in large-scale promotion work with the provincial governments of Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi, respectively. As for the national effort with huge financial resources, bringing together Chinese and American experts, and promoted by the government with political power, it has been since today.</p>
<p>Host's Comments: Mr. Yen expressed his gratification at the establishment of the Joint Committee for Rural Reconstruction and has confidence in its future achievements. He said: "This time, the US aid specifically designated funds for improving the welfare of Chinese farmers and alleviating their suffering, which shows the American people's respect and sympathy for the Chinese people. Based on their experience of fighting together in the Anti-Japanese War, they believe that the Chinese people possess immense power, but they have not had the opportunity to develop it. Now, the work of rural construction should aim to cultivate and unleash their power." Mr. Yen has been engaged in the rural construction movement in China for 30 years, and his achievements are remarkable, and he has long been admired by academic circles at home and abroad. His research insights and practical experience in rural construction cannot be fully understood in a brief evening conversation. Mr. Yen's acceptance of the government's important task clearly demonstrates his great confidence in rebuilding the disaster-stricken rural areas of China. The following is the conclusion based on Mr. Yen's own words:</p>
<p>"China has had nearly 30 years of rural programs seeking to increase the welfare of farmers and alleviate their suffering. This time, US aid will assist us in promoting the rural construction movement. In short, foreign aid is nothing more than assisting us in fully developing 'self-reliance.' We can only achieve 'regeneration' with 'self-reliance.' Everything depends on our own efforts and the cooperation of all sectors of society." (The End)</p>

<h3>Three Envoys Meet Soviet Foreign Minister Again; No Agreement Reached on Resolving Berlin Crisis; Soviets Insist on Terminating West German Government Plan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Moscow, 16th - Radio Moscow: The envoys of Britain, the United States, and France met again with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 16th to resolve the Berlin crisis and other German issues. The meeting was held at the Kremlin at 6 p.m. and lasted approximately one hour. After the meeting, the envoys of the three countries, representing their respective governments, conferred at the British Embassy on the results of the meeting. To date, Western powers' diplomats have held more than twelve hours of talks with Molotov and other Soviet officials, including one meeting with Stalin. According to British Ambassador Smith, no conclusion has been reached in the talks so far.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 16th - Radio Berlin: Despite the Soviet Union's opposition to the West German government plan, Western military leaders are actively pursuing the plan. US Commander in Germany Clay and the British and French Commanders in Germany are scheduled to meet with German leaders on the 16th to draft a provisional constitution for West Germany. Western countries also plan to hold a conference in September to formulate detailed plans for the joint management of the Ruhr area. Regarding the secret meetings in Moscow, it is reported that the Soviet Union specifically demands the termination of the West German government plan, which may be the biggest obstacle to reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] The Kremlin talks have been lengthy, and there has been no official statement to date. It was generally believed that the negotiations could lead to a four-power foreign ministers' conference, but now this hope is becoming increasingly slim. Western countries continue to promote the plan to establish a West German government, and the Soviet Union's opposition to the plan is a well-known fact. The three Western commanders-in-chief in Germany are scheduled to meet with German political leaders in Frankfurt on the 16th to discuss the West German plan. The six Western countries that signed the London West German Agreement will also meet next month to discuss the details of the joint management of the Ruhr area. According to the plan, German representatives will meet in September to produce a provisional constitution for West Germany. Western European diplomatic circles are hoping that the disputes between the US and the Soviet Union will not dispel the last ray of hope for an East-West agreement. They believe that the disputes should not affect the negotiations, but they are still filled with anxieties. British newspapers reflect public opinion's extreme concern about East-West relations, fearing that the appeasement policies of the past will be repeated today.</p>
<h3>Rumor Says Vyshinsky Personally Went to Berlin to Order the German Communist Party to Carry Out Purges in Order to Emulate the People's Revolution Launched in Czechoslovakia and Hungary</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] The "Black Echo" of the Free Democratic Party reported on the 16th that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had recently personally inspected Berlin, and immediately ordered the German Communist Party to be purged and reorganized into "combat cadres." The report said that since Vyshinsky's visit to Berlin, the Kremlin had bypassed Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky and directly issued orders to lower levels, and Moscow directly monitored and directed the Soviet Union's policy in Germany. The new head of the Soviet Union in Germany is Rokossovsky, who arrived here two months ago. Western intelligence sources said that Rokossovsky is currently the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Western Army, overseeing Germany and Austria, with headquarters in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Intelligence officials also said that Rokossovsky may now be personally directing a war game that began a month ago in Germany, but no Western observers have been able to confirm that Vyshinsky had been to Germany. "Monday Echo" also said that the two men, Rokossovsky and Vyshinsky, had held several meetings with German Communist Party leaders Pieck and Diekmann. The former ordered party members to undergo strict purges, only allowing "extremely active and loyal" communists to remain in the party. The purges should be extended to the economic committees, industries, and police in the Soviet-occupied zone. It also said that Vyshinsky ordered the Communist Party to no longer cooperate with non-Communist parties in East Germany, so it is predicted that the Free Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party will soon be banned in the Soviet zone. Western observers believe that this is clearly a Soviet plan, and said that the Soviet Union is prepared to emulate Hungary and Czechoslovakia, ordering East Germany to launch a "people's revolution."</p>
<h3>Currency War Intensifies in East and West Berlin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] Western authorities admit that they are very concerned about the influx of West German marks into Soviet hands. This phenomenon has continued since the Soviet Union froze East German mark accounts. It is generally speculated that the Soviet Union may be accumulating West German marks, either to fund Communist activities in West Germany, or to dump them in the West German-occupied zone in the future, causing new inflation. Since the West German currency reform on June 23, the total value of West German marks circulating in Berlin is approximately 400 million. Germans in West Berlin are requesting an increase in the amount in circulation to alleviate the financial distress caused by the Soviet blockade of currency, and Western authorities agree with this view. However, Frankfurt bank officials doubt whether it is appropriate to increase the circulation of West German marks in West Berlin under the current circumstances. The three anti-Communist political parties in Berlin submitted a memorandum to the Western authorities last weekend, requesting that the West German mark be recognized as the only legal currency in West Berlin. The Communist Party has seized on this request again. The Soviet military newspaper demanded that the current Berlin city council be overthrown and replaced by a Communist group. The article stated: "The anti-Communist group's request to recognize the West German mark as legal currency is an attempt to obstruct any East-West agreement in the Moscow talks."</p>
<h3>US Air Force Chief of Staff Arrives in Turkey to Inspect Turkish Air Force Equipment</h3>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 16th] US Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg and Air Force Secretary Symington arrived in Ankara at noon on the 16th and will inspect Turkish Air Force equipment. They will meet with Turkish President Inonu on the afternoon of the 16th. They were transported by 18 American-aided aircraft piloted by Turkish Air Force personnel.</p>
<h3>Scarlet Fever Epidemic in Switzerland, More Than a Thousand Deaths</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 16th - Radio: A scarlet fever epidemic is sweeping through Basel, Switzerland. The two children's hospitals are full, and the authorities have set up temporary hospitals near schools. The city-wide death rate has reached over a thousand, and schools have been closed since the 16th.</p>
<h3>Britain, America and France Refuse to Participate in the Drafting of the New Danube River Treaty; Italy, Greece and Belgium Notify They Will Not Abandon Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] London, 16th - Radio Belgrade: Italy, Greece, and Belgium have formally notified the Danube River Conference of their determination to protect their navigation rights on the Danube River. The three countries declared in their notification that they were determined to retain their rights as participants in the 1921 convention, including navigation rights on the Danube River. The conference studied the details of the new convention on the morning of the 16th, in order to replace the 1921 convention.</p>
<p>[United Press, Belgrade, 16th] The representatives of Britain, the United States, and France attending the Danube River Conference announced on the 16th that they would not participate in the drafting committee to draft the new Danube River Convention. US Ambassador Cannon said that the work of the drafting committee was only to arrange three or four amendments in order. Since English is no longer an official language, it is unwise to participate at this time. Soviet representative Vyshinsky moved to invite the British representative to participate in the drafting, but was rejected by the British representative, Chairman Baker. Vyshinsky said that if the United States is unwilling to participate in the work of the conference, "we will continue anyway" and believe that the attitude of the non-participating countries is not considerate. Baker finally announced the establishment of the drafting committee, composed of the five countries of the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. Britain believes that the Soviet Union's amendment to Article 41 of the convention is inappropriate, giving countries involved in disputes the right to comment on their actions, and has proposed another amendment, which the United States fully supports.</p>
<h3>The Four Countries Continue to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories at the London Conference; Libya Becomes the Focus of the Dispute Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] According to confirmed information here: the secret discussions on the issue of Italian territories at the four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting will reach a decisive stage this week. It is widely believed that the "easier" issues of Somalia and Istria have been discussed and completed. The four deputy foreign ministers will shift their attention to the most difficult issue, Libya. It is generally expected that the Soviet Union and the Western allies will have extremely fierce conflicts on this issue.</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union clearly stated its opposition to British trusteeship of Cyrenaica and French trusteeship of Fezzan in the Four-Power Consultation Committee, Britain and France may stand on the same front on the Libya issue. However, the news blackout policy is still in effect, so the content of the meeting has not been officially announced. The meeting is chaired by French Ambassador Maschigli this week.</p>
<h3>Indian and Pakistani Leaders Deliver Speeches Commemorating Independence, Reviewing Achievements of the Past Year</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 15th] India celebrated its first year of independence with enthusiasm today. In the commemorative ceremonies in various places in New Delhi, respects were first paid to Gandhi. Nehru delivered a radio speech, expressing satisfaction with the achievements of the new India in the past year. He continued: "The Indian people should remember the teachings of the father of the nation, Gandhi, 'What the country can give to the people is what the people give to the country. The country is the shadow of the people.'" He further called on the people of the whole country to strictly observe discipline, and emphasized the sincerity of demanding peace and cooperation with all countries, especially with Pakistan.

Our achievements of the past year have exceeded previous expectations, and we now have sufficient military strength to resist aggression from any direction."</p>
<h3>Siam Brewing New Coup d'état; National Military and Police Ordered to Be on High Alert</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 16th] Siamese Prime Minister Pibul's serious-natured broadcast speech on the 15th has further increased the serious atmosphere of the tense political situation in the past two weeks. The speech was a warning to the so-called troublemakers. Luang Pibul said that the Siamese government has now taken measures sufficient to cope with any incident and will use all its strength to maintain order. It is widely believed that this statement is a sign that the Siamese government will implement national martial law in the event of an emergency. The Siamese military and police have been ordered to be on high alert in the next few days. Siam was still calm on the surface a month ago, but Luang Pibul's speech has surprised most people. Observers believe that if any danger occurs in Siam, it must come from Siam's small number of factions. However, foreign observers have yet to learn which party will hold a new coup. Naturally, the Siamese government considers the current situation to be extremely serious and is also concerned about the events that may occur in the next few weeks.</p>

<h3>Japan and Sterling Area Countries Sign Preliminary Trade Agreement, Exchanging Goods Worth Over 240 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] At the trade conference between the Sterling Area and the Allied Headquarters, a draft trade agreement was completed on the 16th, increasing the trade volume between Japan and Sterling Area countries by 350%, stipulating that between July 1, 1948, and June 30, 1949, the two sides would at least balance the exchange of goods worth a total of 244.2 million US dollars in one year. This preliminary agreement between business representatives is the result of a month-long meeting and must now be approved separately by each Sterling Area country and MacArthur. The exchange will be conducted on a Sterling cash basis to avoid trade imbalances. Japan is expected to export at least 122.1 million US dollars worth of goods to Sterling Area countries and import goods of the same value from Sterling Area countries. Japan's exports will include cotton textiles, raw silk, rayon, wool products, industrial machinery and parts, railway sleepers, paper and paper products, and various chemicals. Sterling Area countries will sell cotton, wool, hemp, wool waste, paper scraps, rawhides, small animal skins, grains, iron and other minerals, gum and resin, rubber, coal, jute, copra, and coconuts to Japan. The draft agreement also decided to conduct a comprehensive review of trade relations no later than January 15, 1949. The representatives of the Sterling Area countries attending the conference were Britain and its colonies (except Hong Kong), the British Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, and South Africa. India only sent observers and has not indicated whether it will actually participate in the agreement.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Advocates Quickly Setting the Exchange Rate for the Yen to Stabilize the Current Monetary System in Japan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Republican Congressman Fulton told the Associated Press on the 15th that he believed "the United States should act quickly to formulate a standard exchange rate to stabilize the Japanese monetary system." Fulton is the chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and currently serves as a member and secretary of the joint "supervisory" committee of both houses on foreign recovery programs. The committee will travel to various Pacific islands this autumn to investigate.</p>
<h3>Japanese Socialist Democratic Party Advocates Quickly Opening a Peace Conference with Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to sources from the Socialist Democratic Party, the party plans to submit an urgent motion at the upcoming temporary session of the parliament, requesting that the peace conference with Japan be held as soon as possible. The reason is that the unnecessary delay in Japan's independence and autonomy will encourage the tendency of the Japanese to rely on foreign aid and make Japan's recovery more difficult. The Socialist Democratic Party will also demand that the disposal of reparations goods guarantee the minimum survival rights of the Japanese people. At the same time, in order to consider Japan's security, it will be designated as a permanently neutral country or a collective security country of the United Nations. Socialist Democratic Party sources believe that unless a peace treaty is signed, Japan will have various difficulties and will not be able to implement the entire recovery plan. Some internal problems are related to international relations and cannot be resolved before Japan re-enters the community of nations.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Kasenkina's Statement Deemed Worthless by Soviets Because it Must Pass Through the Hands of US Intelligence Personnel</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] The Soviet official news agency TASS said on the 15th that Mrs. Kasenkina's statement "is of no value, because these statements are issued by the American police and intelligence personnel." TASS New York did not specify any particular statement, but it is widely believed to refer to Mrs. Gao's statement that she had been imprisoned in the consulate. TASS also said that the Soviet teacher could not be trusted, because "her life and death depend on the actions and plans of American officials."</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 13th] Pan Youxin denied rumors that he had asked Mrs. Kasenkina to make a sworn statement in exchange for a promise of immunity from Soviet punishment in the future.</p>
<h3>US State Department Refutes Soviet Fabricated Espionage Case The Entire Case Was Arranged by the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The State Department issued a communique refuting the Soviet government's accusation that former US Naval Attaché to Moscow, Terrell, was a spy. The State Department revealed that Terrell, who is currently serving in the Naval Intelligence Department in Washington, was detained by the Soviet authorities on April 23 this year on charges of espionage and demanded his immediate expulsion. However, the then US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, pointed out that Terrell had applied for a passport ten days ago in preparation for his immediate return to the country. Smith further pointed out to Vyshinsky that Terrell's visit to the Moscow customs was due to the request of a customs official to handle the goods shipped from Odessa by the US Embassy. The entire development of the incident seems to have been arranged by the Soviet side.</p>

<h3>Public Utilities Firmly Refuse to Lower Prices; Mayor Proposes Four Suggestions and Urges Consideration Before Reporting to the Government Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Municipal Council's Provisional General Assembly resolved to reduce the prices of public utilities for this month, Mayor Wu summoned representatives of the respective companies to the Municipal Government for discussions at 3:00 PM yesterday. The companies resolutely refused to lower prices, maintaining a firm stance. In addition to representatives from American-owned Electric Power, American-owned Telephone, British-owned Water, British-owned Gas, British-owned Tram, French-owned Water and Electricity, and Chinese-owned Zhabei and Pudong companies, those invited to attend the discussions yesterday included Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, Deputy Speaker Xu, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, Convener of the Public Utilities Sub-committee Li Wenjie, Jiang Hao, and Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, totaling over thirty people. The meeting lasted for four hours.</p>
<p>Representatives from the various public utility companies spoke in turn, stating the insufficient income of their respective companies and expressing hope that there would be no further reductions. They even stated that if citizens refused to pay or delayed paying the new prices, leading to a decrease in company revenue, they would be forced to stop water and electricity supply, and the responsibility should lie with the organ that decided to reduce prices. He Qing, the General Manager of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, advocated for government subsidies instead of loans. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Councilor Jiang Hao, Councilor Li Wenjie, and Director Zhao Zengjue repeatedly urged them, but no concrete results were achieved. Speaker Pan detailed the painstaking efforts of the Municipal Council in this matter, starting with five hours of serious discussion at the Provisional General Assembly, which resulted in this compromise on price reductions. If the companies persisted in their own views, refused to accept it, and even relied on their privileged monopoly to threaten to stop water and electricity supply, it would affect social security, and the responsibility should be borne by the respective companies. This is something that the Mayor and the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau should pay special attention to. Mayor Wu finally put forward four suggestions: (1) Each company should accept the Municipal Council's price reductions for August; (2) The actual amount of insufficient revenue in August should be applied to the Central Bank for loans by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the Municipal Council; (3) The method of repaying the principal and interest on the loan should be discussed to appropriately extend the installments in order to reduce the burden; (4) A public investigation and deliberation committee for public utilities should be organized as soon as possible, and a meeting should be held this Wednesday to impartially review the actual income and expenditure of each company and re-establish the pricing standards starting from September. The Mayor also hoped that representatives of each company would go back and consider, and report the results to the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today (Monday) in the hope of a satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3>Speaker Pan Tells Reporters After Meeting That If They Threaten by Stopping Supply, the Government Has the Right to Take Over</h3>
<p>Speaker Pan Gongzhan told reporters after the meeting: (1) This time, the price increase of public utilities was too great, causing public dissatisfaction and leading to the brewing of a refusal-to-pay movement. The Municipal Council, based on the emergency proposal of sixty to seventy councilors, first submitted it to the Public Utilities Subcommittee for research, and then convened a Provisional General Assembly to thoroughly debate and pass a compromise plan. He believed it was impartial and could take into account both the burden on citizens and the economic situation of the company. Only in this way could a more reasonable solution be reached. (2) The 50% increase in the index in the calculation method of the new price of public utilities this time has no basis. Moreover, whether this calculation method is reasonable is fundamentally questionable. If it is said that the burden on citizens can be arbitrarily increased after approval by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Council is not allowed to intervene, then if any refusal-to-pay or delay-to-pay movement occurs in the future, it cannot be said that the Municipal Council did not plan to eliminate it beforehand. Moreover, the Mayor once submitted a special case to the Municipal Council, hoping to organize an open investigation and deliberation committee to be responsible for approving price matters. Whether the Municipal Council has the right to do so still needs to be asked of the government authorities.</p>
<p>Monopoly Enterprises Have Their Responsibilities</p>
<p>(3) If each company relies on its public utility as a monopoly enterprise and arbitrarily threatens to stop supply, it is deliberately disrupting social order and is absolutely intolerable to citizens. It must be known that all monopoly enterprises have their rights, and they must also have their responsibilities, both in normal times and especially in extraordinary times. It is deeply believed that if the authorities of Chinese and foreign companies recognize the times and face reality, they will not take such a bad policy, otherwise they will betray the painstaking efforts of the Municipal Council and will inevitably suffer the consequences. In the event of last resort, the people's organ has the right to require the local government to temporarily take over any company that deliberately threatens, in accordance with the methods used by the British and American governments to deal with coal mine strikes during the war, in order to prevent the lives of citizens from being affected.</p>
<p>Hoping that the Government Has a Long-Term Vision</p>
<p>(4) I had long anticipated that the repeated price increases of public utilities would inevitably lead to social unrest, so I repeatedly appealed to the central government to pay attention to it, or to adopt subsidies, or to grant loans, and to pre-settle three months of foreign exchange to pre-purchase three months of fuel and materials in order to strive for the stability of public utility prices, thereby reducing the stimulus of general price increases. Unfortunately, the central authorities have a very short-sighted vision and regard it as insignificant. It is hoped that in the future, it can face reality squarely, strive for long-term goals, and strive to make public utilities sustainable and the people's burden can be reduced. If the trend of general price increases can be slowed down as a result, the central government will have gained a great deal.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Returns to Shanghai and Discusses the Reasons for High Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has returned to Shanghai after his vacation from Taiwan. When reporters interviewed Director Wu yesterday, he said: The price of rice in Taiwan is much lower than in this city, currently only over ten million legal tender per stone. If it is smuggled into the country, the profit is very high, so the Taiwan Provincial Government pays close attention to rice smuggling. More than one hundred refugees from this city were evacuated to Taiwan, but Taiwan Province does not welcome this. The main reason for the high prices in this city is the excessively high interest rates of businesses. If newspapers regularly publish weekly deposits from businesses, the principal and interest can be repaid in more than fifty days. The business must lend out at even higher interest rates in order to make a profit. How can this not stimulate prices? As for warehouse inspections, the general survey can be carried out this week because various survey forms were not printed last week.</p>
<h3>Zhao Junhao and Others Propose to Open Low-Price Buses in the Morning</h3>

<h3>Few Moviegoers; Film Distributors Still Want to Raise Prices; Film Industry to Discuss Solutions Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the publication of the cost of living index for the first half of this month, movie theaters feel great difficulty in whether to raise prices. Film distributors are determined to demand that ticket prices should still be increased according to the index, otherwise they will stop supplying new films again. However, the theaters themselves believe that ticket prices have not been adjusted for long, and the box office has been sluggish for half a month, which proves that the purchasing power of the audience has gradually weakened, so they do not advocate raising prices again for the time being, so as not to affect business. In order to reconcile the opinions between the two parties and discuss an appropriate solution, the Film Industry Association will convene a meeting on the 18th for discussion. It is heard that the theaters are already communicating with the film distributors, and the final possible solution is to adopt a weekly increase in prices.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Deng Zhonghe, the owner of the Huizhong Hotel and the director of the Anle Textile Factory in this city, who was reported to the High Procuratorate by the victim Zhu Zhengwen for the crime of traitor, has attracted much attention. Reporters from various newspapers in this city visited Luo Shouchang, the prosecutor in charge of the High Procuratorate, yesterday morning. He first denied the rumors that this case was related to the special relief contribution. He then said that in addition to paying 60 billion in bail, the defendant also has three reliable shop guarantors: Donglai Bank, Huizhong Hotel, and Daqing Automobile Company.

Zhu secretly fled back to Chongqing for treatment. Although Zhu has now returned from Chongqing, his scars still ache, so he filed a complaint with the High Procuratorate, accusing Deng of hindering his personal freedom by relying on the power of the enemy and puppets.</p>

According to Li Ling, because she was deceived by Liu, she committed suicide by taking poison in Pingdu in April, and the matter was widely reported in Pingjin newspapers. Li and Liu met in the first month of the lunar year this year, at the home of Lao Shandong, the mother of Kunqu actress Wu Suqiu, No. 8 Da Jing Hutong. However, the rumor that they played mahjong together at the time, and as a result, Li lost two taels of gold, and Liu generously did not care, so the relationship developed, which Li said was not true.

<h3>Songhu Garrison Deputy Commander Centrally Designated Jiang Jingguo; Commander Xuan Cables the President to Issue the Appointment Early</h3>
<p>Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, met with reporters on the 16th and revealed that Jiang Jingguo had been internally designated by the central authorities as the Deputy Commander of the Garrison. This may be a precursor to the implementation of total war in Songhu. Yang Songfei, the current Deputy Commander of the Garrison Department, has been ordered to take the post of Director of the First District Military Law Enforcement Department of the Ministry of National Defense. Xuan said: The competent department of the Ministry of National Defense believes that the Beijing-Shanghai area is important. In order to ensure tranquility, it has been proposed to implement a total war in accordance with the methods of the Subei Appeasement Zone, with military affairs as the main focus. All political and economic measures are subject to its supervision, in order to use the overall strength to first eliminate the scattered bandits and then seek political innovation and economic stability. This plan is currently under review by the highest authorities. Xuan continued: If the plan to implement total war in Songhu is realized, Jiang Jingguo's appointment as Deputy Commander will be enough to excite the citizens who generally place high hopes on Jiang.</p>
<p>People in Songhu Have High Hopes</p>
<p>He said that Jiang's ideals and views are very close to his. Whenever a major event occurs in Shanghai, there are rumors that Jiang will come to Shanghai to take a certain position. This shows the general people's desire for Jiang. He once sent a letter to Jiang some time ago, explaining the feelings of the people in Songhu, and he also represented one of the citizens to express his welcome. Recently, he sent a telegram to the President, urging him to issue Jiang's appointment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Organization of the Police Department Will Be Expanded</p>
<p>When asked by reporters whether the jurisdiction and organization of the Songhu Garrison Command would be expanded when the total war is implemented, Xuan replied that the expansion of the jurisdiction is actually impossible, but the internal organization will be expanded to meet new needs. For example, an agency responsible for political work will be established in the political field, and an agency will also be established in the economic field. However, although the implementation of total war is mainly military, a joint agency that cooperates with politics will be established in the execution.</p>

<h3>Releasing Smuggled Steel Cables, Demanding Rewards Causes Internal Strife, Many Supply Bureau Inspectors Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Shuping, a Hangzhou native and staff member of the Delivery Group of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, was previously stationed at the Kaiping Wharf to handle the delivery of surplus U.S. military supplies shipped from abroad by the bureau. Shao Guozheng, Yang Chongshun, Yan Xifan, Wang Yicheng, Li Baofan, Liu Lanxin, Ding Wenjun, Sheng Bianquan, and Wang Zemin were all inspectors from the bureau's Inspection Brigade, stationed at various wharves to inspect the loading and unloading of materials. On the 25th of last month, Ge Xingkun, an outside employee of the Li Yongji Stevedoring Company in this city, learned that the Clark Perrey Victory, a ship chartered by the Materials Supply Bureau, was shipping surplus U.S. military supplies from Guam to Shanghai. Several foreign sailors on board were carrying ten bundles of steel cables hidden in the cabins, intending to smuggle them into Shanghai for sale. However, due to strict wharf security, they were unable to land. Ge then consulted with Chen Shuping, whom he knew well. Chen introduced Ge to Shao Guozheng, who was on duty on the ship. Ge was then able to directly negotiate the purchase of the steel cables with the foreign sailors on the ship. At around 12:00 AM on the 28th of the same month, Ge rowed a small sampan to the ship to unload the goods. However, because loading a large amount of steel cables late at night and sailing on the Huangpu River would easily arouse suspicion from the police, Shao Guozheng introduced Yang Chongshun and Li Baofan to assist, allowing Ge to escort the goods away from the ship. At the same time, Yan Xifan demanded a reward from Ge, who paid him US$40. Then, through Guo Xunxu, an inspector who is currently at large, for fear that the inspectors would witness the previous events during their duty and report them, the money was divided equally. Shao Guozheng, Yan Xifan, Wang Yicheng, Li Baofan, Liu Lanxin, Ding Wenjun, Sheng Bianquan, and Wang Zemin each received US$5.50, and they discussed and asked Shao Guozheng and others to agree to cooperate and keep the secret, to which everyone gladly agreed. The next day, Yang Chongshun, because he did not receive a reward for escorting the steel cables, went to Ge's residence to demand 500 million 法幣 (legal tender). Ge, seeing that the profit from buying the steel cables was very small, refused to pay. Yang then pulled out a sharp knife and threatened him. After Guo Xunxu mediated, Ge paid 100 million 法幣 to settle the matter, and Guo then took the opportunity to extort US$20 and left. That afternoon, Chen Shuping and Shao Guozheng also tracked down to Ge's house to demand a reward, and stated that it was not yet known whether the steel cables were public property of the Supply Bureau. If he was stingy and did not pay the reward, they would report to the competent authorities to confiscate and punish him, as a threat. Ge, fearing the crime, was forced to pay Shao Guozheng US$10, and invited Chen Shuping and others to a meeting in a Sichuan restaurant on Edward Road the next day. At that time, Ge took out 40 million 法幣. Chen and others thought the amount was too small and refused to accept it, and left with complaints. Later, Chen deeply resented that Shao and Guo had received generous rewards alone and were unwilling to share them, so he negotiated sternly with Shao and Guo, almost to the point of violence. Shao, fearing that Chen would report to the Supply Bureau first, jointly with Yan Xifan, Guo Xunxu, Wang Yicheng, Li Baofan, Liu Lanxin, Ding Wenjun, Sheng Bianquan, and Wang Zemin, submitted a written report to the bureau's supervisors. The bureau then summoned Chen, Ge, and others to the bureau. However, Guo Xunxu had already taken the opportunity to flee without a trace on the 30th of the same month. The bureau transferred all the case files to the District Procuratorate for investigation, which has now concluded, and they have been prosecuted separately for violating the regulations on punishing smuggling and for the crime of intimidation.</p>

The entire city of Dihua does not yet have a mosque that can accommodate so many people, so it had to be held on the playground of this highest institution of learning in the border region.</p>

Every Muslim silently made sincere prayers for the prosperity and well-being of New China and the stability and progress of Xinjiang in accordance with the established solemn and dignified ceremony.</p>
<p>Non-Muslims Go to Pay Congratulations</p>
<p>On the other hand, non-Muslim military and political leaders gathered at the New Building at 10:00 AM, a total of more than 30 people, led by Tao Jian, the commander of the station, who had just arrived in Xinjiang for only two or three days, and traveled in a snake-like car procession through the entire urban area, to pay New Year's greetings separately to the Muslim leaders, Ahong. gentry's home. At Chairman Masud's official residence, at Commander Ma Chengxiang, Grand Teacher Ma, Secretary-General Aisha, Director Wang, Director Yimin, Deputy Director Bai and the private residences of major Ahong, there were unusually enthusiastic celebrations and answers, and the hosts entertained guests with self-made oil fragrance and clear tea. They were particularly honored by the arrival of Commander Tao Jian.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Performance of Songs and Dances</p>
<p>The five-act song and dance drama "Miss Ni Yaz," which was performed to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, is Chairman Mai's proud masterpiece, directed by Muhammad Emati Haji and performed by the entire Youth Song and Dance Troupe (ie Xinjiang Song and Dance Visiting Troupe). As soon as it got dark, the entrance to the Uyghur General Association was already crowded. Upstairs and downstairs, there was no place to stand in an instant. The number of tickets sold broke the record of any previous public performance. Nanliang Square also showed movies to entertain the people for free.</p>
<p>On the third day of Eid al-Fitr, Muslim women appeared on the streets to pay New Year's greetings to each other, dressed in red and green, with gorgeous clothes and ornaments. The colors of the cars and horses were dazzling and filled with joy. (Lin)</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Jinan on the 16th] A unique love triangle comedy of catching a adulterer by a cuckold has recently occurred here.

<h3>After the issuance of 250,000 face value Customs Gold Units (關金劵), the Cash Panic Gradually Relieved, The Market Response Was Quite Good and Prices Did Not Change Drastically</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Customs Gold Units (關金劵) with a face value of 250,000 were issued in various places yesterday. The issuing bureau of the Central Bank stated that they will supply it according to the needs of the market and will not issue it without limit. According to this, most of the large banknotes are used by those who go to other places, so as of now, few are circulating in this city. The financial authorities hope that the cash panic in various places can be relieved after the issuance of this Customs Gold. The widespread circulation of banknotes in the past two weeks is a distorted phenomenon under the cash panic, and the Gold Control Bureau has decided to strictly ban it from today.</p>
<p>Also, although yesterday was the day of issuance of the huge Customs Gold, the market conditions for gauze and daily necessities fell across the board by 10%, and the Chinese stocks also fell unanimously, which was beyond the expectations of ordinary citizens. Analyzing the reasons, it is probably nothing more than the following points: (1) Although yesterday was the day when huge Customs Gold was issued, in order to prevent price fluctuations, in addition to tightening the money supply, the Economic Inspection Bureau dispatched all personnel to monitor the main markets throughout the day. (2) The rise in the cost of living by 80% to 90% has a negative impact on the Chinese stock market. At the same time, manufacturers need a large amount of money to pay wages, and many people are throwing out supplies. There are many suppliers, which affects general prices. (3) Negative news is frequently spread, and there are many rumors. For example, Ambassador Stuart and Shao Lizi were summoned to Gu, and the rumors were revived. The authorities' cautious and thorough consideration of the new economic plan, and their holding back from releasing it, made general speculators believe that there might be drastic measures in it, which made them deeply vigilant. This point has a great impact on the market mentality.</p>
<h3>Silver Tightness Causes Panic; Chinese Stock Market Trends Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market was weak, primarily due to tighter credit conditions. Police surveillance of the market discouraged buying. Even the large amount of customs gold released yesterday failed to stimulate prices.</p>
<p>Yong Sha opened at 15,500 yuan in the morning, down 400 yuan from last weekend, showing weakness. Stocks No. 154, 153, 225, and 170 initially declined, but then rose to 15,800 yuan. However, this was short-lived. Lacking support from major investors, individual investors became cautious and selling pressure increased. Stocks No. 83, 196, 180, 164, 65, 224, 176, 12, and 55 were sold off, gradually falling to 15,200 yuan. Short sellers covered their positions at lower prices, and buyers struggled to rally, rising several times to 15,400 yuan. Due to tighter credit, securities firms had outflows but no inflows. Short sellers feared losses and closed positions. Stocks No. 78, 65, 224, 197, 220, and grain merchants sold heavily, causing prices to plummet to a low of 15,150 yuan. The general decline in commodity prices outside the stock market further exacerbated the situation, with more sellers than buyers leading to a complete collapse. Near the close, stocks No. 197, 71, and 55 were bought. Yong Sha closed at 15,280 yuan. Small-cap stocks declined rapidly due to widespread selling by individual investors. Jingfu and Xinguang once reached 90 yuan and 140 yuan, respectively, but closed at 88 yuan and 137 yuan, resulting in a loss of over 50%. Zhongshui reached the daily limit down. Only Xinyi showed gains due to news of a capital increase, attracting buyers. Yong Sha and other stocks fell by varying amounts, up to 50%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yong Sha opened at 15,500 yuan. Stock No. 89 was bought up to 15,600 yuan. Stocks No. 196, 319, 54, and 230 were sold off at higher prices, causing a decline to 15,480 yuan. Short sellers covered their positions, and yarn prices rose again, creating favorable conditions for buying. Stocks No. 187, 65, 200, 22, 183, 178, 55, and 30 were bought at lower prices. New buyers gradually entered the market, pushing prices up to 15,800 yuan. Although Stock No. 224, 216, and 54 were sold off to 15,630 yuan, the National Bank's injection of over 40,000 billion yuan slightly eased credit and improved sentiment. Evening news helped boost buying, and the market turned from weak to firm. Stocks No. 178, 187, 152, 156, 47, and 169 were heavily bought, reaching a high of 15,900 yuan. However, short sellers closed their positions for profit, and stocks No. 190, 65, 61, 154, 224, and 169 were sold again. Yong Sha closed at 15,700 yuan. In the end, Xinyi was still at the daily limit up, and Yong Sha saw a slight increase. Unlisted stocks also showed positive performance.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Due to excessive gains in recent days, bank selling led to a decline. Tong Bing opened at 2.18 million yuan. Rooms 614, 552, and 550 bought on the dip, reaching 2.3 million yuan. However, Rooms 500, 503, and 360 sold, and Chengde also sold on behalf of banks, gradually declining to 2.06 million yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 4-5 million [unclear unit]. In the end, Type C bonds fell by 200,000 yuan, and Type A and B options fell slightly by 20-30,000 yuan. Type D and E bonds also declined by 80,000 yuan and 110,000 yuan, respectively.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Issues New Order Restricting Pound Remittances</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 15th] Hong Kong has issued a new order restricting the flow of pounds between Hong Kong and the sterling area. Starting Sunday, pound remittances between Hong Kong and the sterling area will be limited to 500 pounds, except for: (1) bona fide imports and exports; (2) payment of insurance premiums; (3) necessary travel expenses; and (4) payment of dividends and interest. (Note: The old order only restricted remittances between Hong Kong and London.)</p>
<h3>Remittance Income Increasing</h3>
<p>Expected to Reach 300 Billion This Month</p>
<p>A Bank of China official stated that since the price of foreign exchange certificates was adjusted dynamically, remittance income from overseas Chinese has increased. In May, before the implementation of the foreign exchange certificate system, total remittance income was only 27.8 billion yuan. After adopting the foreign exchange certificate system in June, it increased to 251.6 billion yuan. The total income for July is still being calculated and is expected to increase to over 300 billion yuan. Recently, remittances from the Philippines and Southeast Asia accounted for the largest share. In addition to exchange rate adjustments, domestic exchange rates are also being adjusted to attract remittances. Currently, if remittances from overseas Chinese are sent to Shanghai through private remittance agencies and then to Xiamen, Guangzhou, etc., the remittance fees are extremely high, with only 6 million yuan received for every 10 million yuan remitted. If the Bank of China transfers the remittances to those areas, no remittance fees are charged, and 10 million yuan remitted will result in 10 million yuan received. This greatly benefits overseas Chinese, so remittance income is expected to continue to increase.</p>
<h3>Financial Supervisory Bureau Orders Banks to Establish Transfer Journals</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Financial Supervisory Bureau has repeatedly received reports from inspectors that banks, money shops, and trust companies have largely failed to establish transfer journals, or even if ledgers exist, the records are unclear, which is not in compliance with regulations. The Financial Supervisory Bureau has now notified the Municipal Bankers Association, the Money Shops Association, and the Trust Companies Association to order all banks and companies to immediately implement uniform accounting methods and establish transfer journals with detailed records for inspection and to severely punish violations.</p>
<h3>Credit Tightens and Then Eases; Banks Inject Large Amounts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, credit in Shanghai first tightened and then eased. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a large net outflow of funds during the exchange of bills and notes among the financial institutions, totaling 415.07 billion yuan. Among them, the Central Bank had the largest net outflow of 66.134 billion yuan.

According to sources at the Central Bank, the large outflow yesterday was mainly due to payments for the purchase of foreign exchange certificates and exchange remittances.</p>
<h3>Weak Sales and Profit-Taking Lead to Decline in Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices; Yarn Management Committee Suspends Yarn Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw tighter credit, rising shadow interest rates, and falling cotton cloth and stock prices, leading to weak sentiment. Buyers were cautious, sales were sluggish, and profit-taking increased.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened with a sharp drop of 280 million yuan. Later, due to the Spinning and Weaving Company's announced price reduction, manufacturers offered supply, and the market fell by 50 million yuan. After fluctuating in the middle, it closed at 2.9 billion yuan for immediate delivery and 3 billion yuan for delivery tomorrow, a further drop of 330 million yuan from the weekend. Other counts of yarn also declined by 100-200 million yuan, with 58 transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw continued tightening of credit and the authorities' restrictions on remittances to North China, leading to selling by northern merchants and profit-taking by individual investors. Dyeing factories and local merchants reduced orders, and sales were sluggish, causing sentiment to weaken.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially fell by 5.8 million yuan. Although it rebounded in the middle, it finally settled at 76.8 million yuan, a further drop of 8 million yuan from the weekend.</p>
<p>Other fine cloths, serge, and coarse twill also declined rapidly. However, dyed cloth and shilin cloth were more resilient, with 3,020 pieces traded.</p>
<p>News after the market close indicated that the yarn and stock markets stabilized. Dragon Head fine cloth was bid up to 77.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, under strict police supervision, trading became even more secretive, with very few transactions. Dragon Head fine cloth rose again from 79 million yuan to break the 80 million yuan mark, up 3.2 million yuan from the morning. Four Gentlemen serge also rose by 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Yarn Management Committee has suspended the sale of yarn and cloth, with all sales entrusted to the China Textile Corporation. However, due to the significant decline in yarn prices yesterday, there were not many applications to purchase from the China Textile Corporation. The China Textile Corporation has sold yarn in two rounds. The first round sold 660 pieces (equivalent to 20-count yarn), withdrawing 856.8 billion yuan from circulation.

<p>Flour</p>
<p>Declined sharply, with the sudden tightening of credit being the main reason. The general decline in other commodity prices led sellers to rush to sell, causing prices to fall sharply. Old brand flour opened at 22.3 million yuan and further declined to 21.15 million yuan, a drop of 1.9 million yuan. Bingchuan flour was at 20.5 million yuan, a drop of 2.2 million yuan.

<h3>Rain-Soaked Football Match: Loss to Turkey; Report on the World Olympics Football Team's Crushing Defeat</h3>
<p>— By our Special Correspondent, Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent's Dispatch from London] Today, August 2nd (Monday), is a bank holiday in England. All government offices and large stores in London are closed. However, the World Olympics events held in the suburbs continued as usual.</p>
<p>The weather today was overcast and rainy from early morning. As expected, when I left the Wembley Royal Swimming Pool after watching the men's 800-meter relay at 3:30 PM, it started to rain. I rushed to the track and field to watch the men's 400-meter final and the pole vault selection. After finishing, I hurriedly took a bus to the Walthamstow football field in the suburbs of London to watch our football team's first match against Turkey. At 9:00 PM, our basketball team will play its first round-robin match against Belgium at the Haringey Fitness Center. Therefore, the whole afternoon was spent traveling back and forth between the major sports venues in London in pouring rain, leaving me feeling physically and mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain; Physical Exhaustion</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, our Chinese football team played its first match against Turkey at the Walthamstow football field in London. Despite the pouring rain, the audience was still very crowded, and both the north and south stands were completely full. Many overseas Chinese from the UK came to support the team. Unfortunately, the weather was unfavorable, and it rained heavily during the match. The wet and slippery field greatly affected the team's offense. Coupled with physical exhaustion and bad luck, the second half turned into a one-sided affair. The Chinese football team, which is highly regarded by foreign audiences, finally failed to score and suffered an unprecedented defeat. The lineup and match details of our team are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team Lineup</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Yan Shixin Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng Song Lingsheng Hao Rongsheng</p>
<p>Li Dahui Xie Wenliang Zhu Yongqiang Zhang Jinhai He Yingfen</p>
<p>First Goal Lost Within Five Minutes</p>
<p>At exactly 6:30, the band first played the national anthem of the Republic of China, and the entire audience stood at attention to pay respect. Next, the Turkish national anthem was played, and then the opening kick-off ceremony was held. As soon as the referee blew the whistle, the Turkish team galloped forward, heading straight for the Chinese goal with great momentum. Our team quickly defended, forcing a corner kick. The Turkish team's right-wing shot powerfully, and center forward Kendy headed the ball into the upper left corner of the goal, breaking the net with a resounding sound. Zhang Banglun was unable to save it. In less than five minutes, Turkey easily took the lead with a score of 1-0. After that, our team fought hard to counterattack. However, the Turkish defense was too tight, and they were unable to succeed. When the ball came into our team's hands, they often lost good opportunities due to the wet and slippery field, making it difficult to run. The forwards and wings were also slower, which was not comparable to the Turkish team's speed and running ability. In the first half, the Turkish offensive was very fierce, with many dangerous moments that were turned away by goalkeeper Zhang Banglun. In the midst of extremely thrilling waves, the first half ended with a score of 1-0. During the intense battle between the two teams, a group of dozens of Chinese naval personnel in the UK formed a cheering squad in the south stand to cheer for the team, while Turkey also had a cheering squad, and the two sides competed against each other outside the field.</p>
<p>Three Goals in a Row; The Situation is Lost</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the second half began. The rain was still heavy, and the players' spirit of fighting in the water was commendable. Ten minutes later, center forward Zhu Yongqiang shot powerfully from a distance, hitting the goalpost, just missing the mark. After that, our team repeatedly shot at the goal, but all were saved by the Turkish goalkeeper. Then, the Chinese team gradually ran out of energy. At 7:40, center forward Zhu Yongqiang's right knee was injured by a kick, making him unable to move and forced to leave the field. Our team was severely damaged and unable to resist. The Turkish team immediately took advantage of the opportunity to attack with lightning speed. Center forward Kendy shot from within the penalty area, and the ball went into the net with a bang, making the score 2-0. Less than two minutes later, the Turkish offensive became even more fierce, and the army drove straight in. The left-wing Zilu flipped over and swept angrily, and the ball broke the net again, making the score 3-0. At this time, the Turkish momentum was high. The right midfielder rushed into the prohibited area alone and shot from a distance, scoring another goal, making the score 4-0. Within these five minutes, Turkey scored three goals in a row, and the situation changed drastically. The Chinese team was ultimately unable to reverse the situation due to the loss of momentum. The game ended hastily with the efforts of nine people. Hundreds of overseas Chinese who came in the rain were full of lament and left. The biggest reasons for this defeat, in addition to the rain and bad luck, were that our football players were physically weaker and slower than the Turkish team, resulting in a crushing defeat of 0-4. After the battle, Mr. Chen Lifu, who came from the United States, personally visited the players' rest room to express his condolences, which made the players feel very grateful.</p>

<h3>Tap Water and House Tax</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The tap water bill for July has arrived. A glance reveals over fifteen million yuan, nearly tenfold the amount of a typical month. Initially, I doubted it, fearing a mistake. Upon inquiry, it was explained that the reason June's bill was only a little over one and a half million yuan was that the last price increase was calculated from the day after the meter reading, thus benefiting from a one-time discount. This time, the accumulated deficit was added, resulting in a tenfold jump. However, no matter how it's explained, a water bill of fifteen million yuan a month is a significant expense for a salaried person, and further increases seem endless.</p>
<p>Yet, looking at the summer house tax bill that arrived simultaneously, including the municipal construction donation, it amounts to only fifty-one thousand yuan. This sum likely doesn't even cover the cost of the paper and printing for the triplicate house tax form plus a large envelope, let alone the significant labor involved in processing a house tax form. To claim that such taxes can enrich the national treasury is almost a joke.</p>
<p>I say this not to imply that I willingly pay high house taxes on top of expensive water and electricity bills, but rather because the measures taken by the authorities are so unreasonable that they are alarming. Public utilities like water and electricity have been increasing fees almost monthly, and their standards have far exceeded the cost of living index, even the price index. Why is it that foreign employees in China must be paid in US dollars when conducting business? Foreign public utilities and some municipal public utilities constantly cite rising prices of metal materials, fuel, etc., as reasons for increasing prices. However, we know that the largest metal and fuel merchants in Shanghai are foreign merchants. They are making enormous profits.</p>
<p>For example, several foreign oil companies, unable to repatriate all the profits earned in China over the years, have been massively acquiring real estate in Shanghai. We can see many gas stations occupying large areas in the most prosperous commercial and residential areas such as Nanjing East Road, Zhongzheng East Road, and Linsen West Road. The land in these areas is valued in hundreds and thousands of gold bars, so the total cost can be imagined. Therefore, although the rise in metal and fuel prices affects public utilities, it is still their own people who are profiting.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if public utilities are losing money, alternative ways to compensate should be found, and the public should not be exploited. Moreover, the extent to which Shanghai's major public utilities are losing money is unknown to outsiders. Considering the monthly salaries of tens or hundreds of millions paid to foreign senior staff, slightly reducing internal waste and expenses, in addition to simply raising prices, would also be a remedial measure. However, even with their current salaries, foreign employees are still complaining!</p>
<p>On the other hand, municipal revenue not only fails to keep up with the "leaps" of public utilities but also cannot catch up with the general cost of living index. House tax is one example. It is said that the average house tax paid before the war was equivalent to about one hundred US dollars, but today it is only around one and a half million yuan in national currency, which is only about one percent of the pre-war level. The situation with car license taxes is similar. In other words, the wealthier people are, the lower the proportion of taxes they pay. However, roads in other areas can go unrepaired for years, and the sanitation environment can be ignored, but the roads in the higher-class residential areas must still be kept fairly clean and smooth. This is what is meant by international appearance.</p>
<p>Because those who can afford to pay more tax are unwilling to pay, and the authorities are "inconvenienced" to collect taxes from them, Shanghai's municipal administration is in a helpless situation today. Municipal construction is not discussed, and even the salaries of employees have become a problem. Shanghai, known as the wealthiest city in the country, had to request emergency assistance from the central government last month to overcome the crisis.</p>
<p>I believe that there is undeniable truth to the criticism of government corruption, but it is inaccurate to say that the government is insatiably greedy for the people's money. Based on the policies of government agencies at all levels, at least there is no greed for the money of the wealthy. Past foreign exchange policies and the sale of state-owned enterprises in plans probably benefited some wealthy families!</p>
<p>Because the government cares too much about the interests of a few rich people, any measures that benefit the public but slightly disadvantage the rich cannot be passed smoothly. The property tax has not yet been agreed upon, and many protests have been raised. Relief special donations have been applied with both soft and hard tactics, but the donation from the "Paint King" is even less than a "little yellow fish"!</p>
<p>I believe that if the municipal authorities are determined to seek the welfare of the public, they should formally propose the donations that should and can be increased, without worrying about opposition. Although increasing taxes is something the public does not want to hear, everything must be reasonable. If prices can rise several times in a month and public utilities can rise four or five times at once, then it is unreasonable for legitimate taxes to lag far behind. I am not advocating that taxes should compete with commodity prices, but I believe that those who benefit from rising prices should return a portion of their profits to society through taxes. For example, specially increase the house tax for A and B grade houses, increase the vehicle license tax for self-owned cars, and re-evaluate the benchmark for business tax.</p>
<p>As long as the municipal authorities can earnestly achieve taking from the people and using for the people, they will surely gain the support of the people.</p>
<h3>Purple Qi Comes from the East</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>"Purple Qi Comes from the East" is a well-known story about Lao Tzu passing through the border. The Inner Biography of Guan Ling Yin says: "Guan Ling ascended the tower and looked around, seeing purple qi rising from the easternmost point and heading west. He rejoiced and said, 'A sage must be passing through the capital.' On the appointed day, he fasted and observed abstinence, and on that day, Lao Tzu was indeed seen." Therefore, Du Gongbu's poem also includes the line "Purple Qi coming from the east fills the Hangu Pass." The Record of Strange Things says: "Lao Tzu traveled west, and Guan Ling Yin Xi saw that there was purple qi floating over the pass, and Lao Tzu indeed passed by riding a green ox." The Biography of Lao Zhuang Shen Han in the Historical Records says: "Lao Tzu cultivated morality, and his teachings focused on hiding oneself and avoiding fame. After living in Zhou for a long time, he saw the decline of Zhou and left for the pass. Guan Ling Yin Xi said, 'You are about to go into seclusion, please write a book for me.' So Lao Tzu wrote the upper and lower chapters, speaking of the meaning of morality in more than five thousand words, and left, and no one knew where he ended up."</p>
<p>The existence of Lao Tzu is a question, and the era of Lao Tzu is also a matter of much debate. Earlier scholars mostly believed that he was contemporary with and earlier than Confucius, but modern scholars, based on the content of the Tao Te Ching, mostly conclude that he lived in the Warring States period. Lao Tzu has always been a mysterious and elusive figure. Later generations added mythological embellishments, and Taoist priests revered him as their ancestor, honoring him as the Supreme Old Lord. Thus, Lao Tzu became a sacred and inviolable figure. "Purple Qi Comes from the East" has also become a common subject in Chinese figure paintings.</p>
<p>Painting figures is difficult, and painting historical events is even more difficult. Painting figures can be free from the constraints of time, but painting historical events must be subject to the constraints of time. The most obvious things that show the era are clothing, headwear, carriages, houses, tables, chairs, and furnishings. Because these objects change greatly with different eras, if the research is not detailed, it is easy to make mistakes. The person painted will inevitably wear a Song Dynasty hat and a Tang Dynasty crown, a Jin Dynasty garment and a Han Dynasty dress, combining thousands of years into one, melting past dynasties into one furnace, neither donkey nor horse, and ridiculed by knowledgeable people. Painting historical events not only requires attention to the era but also to the region. The north and south are different, and the customs are also different. If you are not careful, you will inevitably move the scenery of the northern border to Guangdong and the waves of the East China Sea to the shifting sands. This problem did not start today, and even ancient masters could not avoid it. Zhang Yanyuan of the Tang Dynasty had already discussed it in detail. The Record of Famous Paintings of Past Dynasties says: "When discussing clothing, carriages, local customs, figures, ages are different, and the north and south are different. The appropriateness of viewing paintings lies in careful examination. Just like Wu Daozi painting Zhong You, he wears a wooden sword. Yan Linggong painting Zhao Jun, she is already wearing a veil. One does not know that the wooden sword was created in the Jin Dynasty, and the Han hat was used in the current dynasty. Taking this as a general rule is also a disease of painting. For example, the scarf was passed down in the Han and Wei Dynasties, the crowd parted from the Qi and Sui Dynasties, the hood started in the Zhou Dynasty, and the scarf was created in Wude. How can Hu clothing and boots be easily applied to ancient images? How can robes and ribbons be used for modern people for a long time? Grass is not suitable for the northern border, and ox carts are not available in Lingnan. Distinguish the objects of ancient and modern times in detail, compare the customs of the local customs, and draw shapes according to things, and the era can be verified."</p>
<p>"Drawing shapes according to things, and the era can be verified," is in line with the modern painting school's advocacy of "art is a reflection of the times." If we apply the two standards of "era" and "region" to evaluate historical figure paintings of past dynasties, I am afraid that there will not be one perfect and accurate one out of a thousand. The details are not fully discussed, but only the painting title "Purple Qi Comes from the East" will be discussed. According to what I have seen, its era and region are all subject to error. According to the determination of modern scholars, Lao Tzu lived at least in the Warring States period. It is difficult to verify what the clothing of the Warring States period looked like. It is impossible to determine its right or wrong, but modern people paint many obvious errors besides clothing. Ordinary paintings are mostly of an old man with a white beard riding on a water buffalo, followed by a boy with a set of thread-bound books in his hand. I don't know that there are no water buffalo in the Central Plains. The green ox that Lao Tzu rode is what Shanghai people call the yellow ox (yellow cattle have three colors: yellow, green, and black and white). As for thread-bound books, they only appeared after the Song Dynasty. The Warring States period was still in the era of "carving bamboo slips," so how could there be this complete set of thread-bound books? Recently, I saw Xu Beihong's painting exhibition, and there was also "Purple Qi Comes from the East." The painting was still a water buffalo, and Lao Tzu held a scroll in his hand. Although this was hundreds of years earlier than thread-bound books, it was still an object from the Han and Tang Dynasties, not from the Warring States period. Moreover, according to the Historical Records, it was Guan Ling Yin who forced Lao Tzu to write a book, and Lao Tzu began to write the Tao Te Ching, not before leaving the pass. The book had already been written, so it seems that Lao Tzu should not have an unwritten book in his hand. Beihong's painting name is full of the world, but he cannot avoid the mistakes of Wu Daozi painting wooden swords and Yan Linggong painting veils. Others are even more needless to say! This shows the difficulty of painting historical figures, and the reason why there are fewer and fewer authors.</p>
<h3>Tea Party</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Tea party, abbreviated as tea party, is extremely popular today. In terms of its grand scale, it involves international social events, with ambassadors gathering, shaking hands in joy, and accompanied by dancing. All European and American countries attach great importance to it. In our country, it has existed since ancient times. The "Tea Dong Li" records that Qian Qi, whose style name was Zhongwen, had a "tea banquet" with Zhao Ju; he also often visited Sun's house and had a "tea party" with the Lang monk. However, this tea party was a truly veritable tea party, because what was "banqueted" and "met" was nothing but tasting "tea," which differed from the nature of Western customs.</p>
<p>The tea party in Shanghai, which caught the attention of the international community, began in 1897 AD, the twenty-third year of the deceased Qing Guangxu. On the tenth day of the tenth lunar month of that year, the Shanghai Dao Cai Jun, in imitation of Western customs, invited a tea party that evening to celebrate Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday. Thousands of Westerners from various countries attended, both men and women, and even Western merchants from Hong Kong and Hankou came to the meeting, because Westerners were curious, and because China had just created the tea party, they all felt honored to attend. When it was first proposed to invite a tea party, lawyer Dan Wen said to Jun: "I heard that you are inviting a tea party, opening up the Chinese atmosphere, and we Westerners are very happy to hear about it!" That evening, the directors of the Public Works Bureau said to Jun: "You have created this atmosphere, and the layout is gorgeous and meticulous. Even the most elaborate tea parties in Europe and America are only like this. Inviting this tea party is even better than China's continuous victories, so that people from all countries can see it and know that there are still people in China." Recorded in Cai Jun's "Diplomatic Debate." The grand occasion of that day, I think the data room of this newspaper must have details to check. At that time, officials were extremely conservative. Cai Jun had traveled all over the world and had a novel mind. He specially invited a tea party in imitation of Western customs, so it is no wonder that Westerners were surprised and praised him.</p>
<p>The second grand tea party in Shanghai was on the first day of the fourth lunar month in the year of the Wuxu Reform. At that time, Prince Henry of Germany was traveling in China, and wherever he went, he wanted Chinese local officials to prepare a yellow sedan chair to greet him in person! This matter was stopped by Cai Jun's efforts. Cai, representing the Qing court, invited a tea party. According to the "Diplomatic Debate," "On the first day of April, a tea party was invited. More than six hundred men and women attended. Prince Henry was very happy. Tea parties and dances are the most important things in Europe and America."</p>

<p>There is a small state in India called Kashmir. Although it is small, its location is quite important. It is a place where the conflict between India and Muslims is extremely intense. The monarch is fond of seclusion and does not ask about political affairs. All state affairs are left to the officials to make their own decisions. An American journalist once discovered a tax official who held as many as seven positions, and all seven positions were extremely idle, with almost nothing to do. The gentleman put seven desks in his office and went back and forth between the seven desks every day, approving his own reports to himself for fun.</p>

<h3>Ping Sister's Watch</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>After reading the short story collection "Childhood and Watch" by Mr. Chen Jiahua, from the first story "The Landlady" to the seventh story "The Maid," I only felt that the material was rich and the writing was simple and honest. After reading the last story "Childhood and Watch," I couldn't help but be deeply moved. This story is autobiographical. The story is about when the author was twelve or thirteen years old, because he was obsessed with ridiculous books such as "Investiture of the Gods" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," he became mentally disordered, thin, yellow face, dark eyes, nocturnal enuresis, anorexia, afraid of ghosts, and dared not walk around casually. Because of the love of his family, he found Sister Ping to accompany him. At that time, she was fifteen years old, "two small braids, floral shoes, and round eyes." So they read books together, she told him stories, and went to the fields to take a walk together in the evening; not only as a friend, she also acted as his teacher and his nanny. She could sing and write well. After the mental disorder, he was timid, hated the night, hated the moon, and was afraid of seeing the twinkling stars, but with Sister Ping together, he liked the moon and loved to see the starry sky. Soon he recovered from his illness, and she went back, but she often came to see him. Later, she had grown up and was about to get married, and she came to his house to live for another month. On the eve of being urged back until the wedding date, she gave him a watch. The article wrote:</p>
<p>"It was a moonlit night. I was just walking in the garden when she quickly handed me the watch, as if afraid of being seen: 'Hide it well, don't lose it, and be good.'"</p>
<p>Then it wrote:</p>
<p>"The moonlight was very clear that night. I took the money and didn't leave immediately. Her facial expression was very unusual. I was secretly watching her. Her expression was still very excited, as if she wanted to cry."</p>
<p>Ten years have passed, and now the watch is still ticking, which is her heart. The deep sympathy shown between the two sexes due to pity is true love. She rescued him, and he was saved, which is her merit. Of course, he also loves what he has worked so hard to create. There is another paragraph in the article:</p>
<p>"I have a stubborn personality, and no one can do anything to me, but only Sister Ping, with one sentence from her, I will obey everything. I trust her. This is the power of love." They have already resonated with each other, but they cannot become a good couple because they are hindered by social conditions. But love cannot be contained. A watch was transferred under the moon, ticking, representing her heart. This is the expression of true feelings. Tick-tock, of course, it is very pleasant. I have never seen that watch, nor have I heard the sound with my own ears, but just by looking at it in writing, I am also very moved. This is the success of writing.</p>
