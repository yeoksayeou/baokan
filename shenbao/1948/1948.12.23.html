<h3>孫科今晨到院就職　接開首次政務會議　全體閣員名單正式發表　董顯光否認總統同意恢復和談說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿二日電〕行政院新聞局長董顯光，廿二日晚以下列聲明致合衆社：</p>
<p>「新聞局長董顯光斷然否認所謂蔣總統已同意恢復和談及決定和議時下野之說，上述報告絕對不確」。按合衆社廿一日曾報告絕對可靠方面關係和談之新聞，董氏之否認，係對此而發。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕孫科內閣全體閣員之名單，經國民黨中政會通過後，卽由總統任命之，新內閣並定於廿三日上午九時到院就職，十時舉行首次政務會議，延遲幾達一個月之內閣，終底於成。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據悉：行政院副秘書長一職，孫科已決定立法院秘書處長倪炯聲出任。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕孫科內閣名單廿二日公布後，各方均極注意，某權威人士稱：孫內閣最大之變動有二，其一為部長人選中多屬新人，另一為政務委員之份量極重，翁內閣中之部會首長，現僅有徐堪·俞大維·谷正綱·關吉玉·龐松舟·孫越崎六人蟬聯，劉維熾係由僑委會委員長改長工商部，白雲梯係以副委長升任蒙藏委會委長。此外，吳鐵城·洪蘭友·徐永昌·梅貽琦·鍾天心·林可勝·梅汝璈·吳尙鷹·戴愧生等均屬「新人」，其中且多為第一次出任政務官者。至政委中除孫科堅邀之張羣·張治中·陳立夫·翁文灝四人外，前副院長張厲生，敎長朱家驊亦均應邀仍留閣內祖任政委，所有黨內各派領袖，幾悉已包括，頗具舉黨一致巨頭內閣之規模。其政委人選，更充份表現彼等將為決策中心。另悉：梅貽琦出長敎部，係臨時決定者，廿一日晚之名單仍為李蒸，因梅於廿一日抵京，故改請梅出任，然梅氏表示如北平局勢好轉，渠將仍返淸華，故表示堅辭，惟權威人士認為：渠有打銷辭意之可能。</p>

<h3>民社黨不入閣</h3>
<p>靑年黨今開中常會</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨發言人昨重申該黨不入閣之決意，表示該黨仍將以在野黨立堪，對國事有所致力，並希望新閣勢力解除人民之痛苦。發言人謂，該黨主席張君勱，於上月中旬曾就時局大計向總統提出建議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕孫科內閣之陣容中，仍保留農林部及政委一各，讓與靑年黨人士參加。聞孫氏曾邀左舜生續長農林部，陳啓天則任政委，唯兩氏尙未提出答覆，並已於廿三日夜車赴滬，出席該黨廿三日在滬召開之中常會，決定去留。</p>
<h3>翁內閣末次會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕翁內悶廿二日上午九時舉行最後一次會議，仍由副院長張厲生主持，會議進行極為迅速。按翁氏係於六月一日就任，在職共半年，於十一月底辭職獲准後，院務卽由張副院長維持，以迄於今。（政務會議議案刋二版）</p>
<h3>國民黨中常中政兩會　蔣總裁親臨主持　李培基劉健羣候選立院正副院長　沈怡辭職滕傑任京市長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕蔣總裁廿二日晨親自主持國民黨中常會及中政會，通過立法院正。副院長候選人之提名及政院副院長·政院全體閣員之名單，會議係於廿二日晨十時在中央黨部舉行，先開中常會，通過提名李培基。劉健羣為立院正。副院長候選人及吳鐵城為政院副院長後散會，繼之舉行中政會，討論內閣名單，會議進行極速，孫氏原擬之名單，計分兩部份，如非國民黨人員交通部長俞大維，主計部長龐松舟，衛生部長林可勝三氏，卽由孫氏提出報告，其餘除農林部外，均提出討論。敎育部長原定為李蒸，討論後改以梅貽琦出任，聞孫氏廿二日晨曾特親訪梅氏，請其就任，當獲迅速通過，至農林部長及政委一名之空額，尙留待靑年黨入閣。繼通過以次各案：（一）公務員懲戒委會委員長翁敬棠，因病請求退休，遺缺以謝冠生繼任。（二）謝冠生暫兼司法院秘書長。（三）京市長沈怡辭職，以滕傑繼任，迄午散會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國民黨中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城，出任行政院副院長兼外交部長後，實際政務將極忙碌，黨部事務殆難兼顧，聞蔣總裁正考慮其繼任人選中。</p>
<p>梅汝璈</p>
<p>俞大維</p>
<p>鍾天心</p>
<p>林可勝</p>
<p>孫越奇</p>

<p>白雲梯</p>
<h3>立院明日會議　互選正副院長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕立法院第二會期第卅一次會議，定廿四日舉行，屆時可能改變議程，互選新任院長·副院長·至程序委會決定之議程，報告事項中，列有政院咨請審議修正戒嚴法第八條條文案及修正僑務委會僑務局組織條例草案案等。討論事項中，則列有經資法制兩委會關於工商部各屬轄機關組織條例草案之審查報告案多起，衛生法制兩委會關於衛生部檢疫所組織條例草案之審查報告案等。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕據有資格人士稱：國民黨提名李培基·劉健羣為立法院院長，副院長候選人，就目前情勢觀之，劉之副院長可望通過，李氏雖曾任監察委負，豫省府委員兼民政廳長，代理省主席，旋復任省主席，然近年已離開政治舞台，去年始經河北省第一區選出為立法委員，李氏現在北平養疴，如獲當選，亦須政府專機接出，惟立院各委員如互選時，仍支持彼等所擬議之童冠賢及程天放二氏，則將使選票分散，勢須選舉數次。另悉：聞革新俱樂部廿二日曾就此事詳加討論，決定遵守黨的決定，支持李·劉二氏當選。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿二日下午電〕平郊今平靜無事，週邊匪軍全後撤。據有關方面所獲情報，匪自昨夜起，一股已向天津方面轉移，一股向北平西北山區及平綏鐵路沿綫向沙河·淸河·南口方面後退，匪之企圖似欲轉道竄犯察綏，另部南下加緊對天津圍犯。刻平東郊至雙橋間巳為國軍控制，西郊十華里內亦無戰鬥，國軍已向廿華里地區搜索，西南西北城郊匪亦分股撤退。</p>

<h3>紐約時報著文要求　美澄清對華政策　續予援助不能聽其赤化</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿二日電〕紐約時報今特著文要求立卽澄淸美國對華政策。該報指陳，二億七千五百萬元對華之非軍事援助之決定，係遠在中國陷入當今危機之前。該報繼謂：當今局勢亟需較為坦率之言，諒美國實不能聽任中國赤化，對中國赤化之後果，尤不得冷漠視之。該報堅持美援之繼績實為對中國人民要舉。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿二日電〕「紐約時報」廿二日社論，鑒于中國軍事局勢，要求修正美國對華政策。該報稱：「美國在防止共產黨征服希臘中，化費許多努力及金錢，共產黨征服中國之危機，且遠甚于希臘，吾人決不能漠不關心，吾人亦不應關切通過聯合政府以拯救中國使免于共黨統治之可能性，在此種聯合政府中，共黨勢將佔據主要職位，因吾人對于此種妥協之後果，早有極明顯之經驗」。　「另一方面，吾人亦不能辯稱：目前之中國政府已否達成繼續美援之附帶條件，決定中國之領袖及政府，係中國之事，而非美國之事，但如果繼續美援對中國人民係一種重要因素，當然，美國在外交中可讓中國人民獲悉美國對此一代表中國自由主義組織之聯合之政府之意見，以為抗禦共產黨之進一步進攻及以後收復失地之最佳希望」。</p>

<p>〔本報蚌埠廿二日電〕軍息：蚌宿戰塲中殘匪正各就原來位置，休息整理，外傳西竄說不確。據目前所知，劉匪二六兩縱隊，在包家集以西澮淝兩河中間地帶，三縱隊在任橋以東，十一縱隊在其西側。軍方人士告稱：蚌埠正面國軍之沿津浦路北進，係以攻擊與搜索作為對淮南地區之消極的防禦，至於北綫方面，匪之壓力已大為减輕，但若論該處國軍向淮南靠攏，恐尙需經過一番戰鬥。</p>
<p>〔本報蚌埠廿二日電〕剿總公報：（一）固鎭附近無匪主力，國軍刻在澮河兩岸掃蕩殘餘土共。（二）北綫杜聿明部當面之匪，因天雨糧缺，戰意消沉，國軍正趁此時機，對匪展開全面攻擊。</p>

<h3>社論　如何獲得光榮和平？</h3>
<p>「千呼萬喚始出來」的新內閣，到昨天總算呱呱墮地。自孫院長奉命組閣，幾及月，多方商洽，瀕於流產，而終能於昨日網羅巨頭，凑成名單，儼然成為國民黨舉黨一致的內閣，此不可謂孫氏之成功。何况在新閣組成的前夕，孫院長向外國記者宣布其內閣為一戰鬥內閣，將繼續作戰以迄獲得光榮和平之時為止，這一驚人的聲明，更使此鑼鼓登塲的新閣有「不同凡響」之概。語云：「飢者易為食，渴者易為飲」。與苦難相奮鬥的老百姓，一旦聽到道「光榮和平」的曲牌，自然不免寄以無窮的期望。</p>
<p>然而，光榮和平的呼聲縱巳喊出，如何可以獲得光榮和平，新閣恐也一時未必有什麼辦法，有什麽把握。這彷彿曲牌儘管點得好，拍曲的歌者有否珠圓玉潤的歌喉，仍是另一問題。因此，老百姓儘管抱着滿懷的期望，而所期望者是否能成為事實，也還是另一問題。</p>
<p>老實說罷：天下人那一個不想快快樂樂過着和平日子的？打了八年抗日大戰的中國人又那一個不想早見和平的天日的？然而和平如果要犧牲了自由纔能獲得，則奴隸的和平生活究竟有多大價值！而且，「天下無不散的筵席」，也就天下沒有不歸於和平的戰爭。有戰爭，必有和平；而無論戰爭的那一方更都希望有光柴的和平·故「光榮和平」雖然是一個可以得人心而又不失面子的漂亮名詞，而其實是多餘的空話。</p>
<p>况且成為問題者：光榮和平的內涵究竟是些什麽呢？那更恐怕要言人人殊了。就戰爭的雙方言，往往甲方以為如此和平始為光榮，而乙方則否；乙方以為如彼和平始為光榮，而甲方又不以為然。然則必如何而能使雙方都認為是光榮的和平呢？其難一也。政府以前之所號召者為中共叛國，而戡亂則所以衛國，今果眞以期望和平之切，不待亂之戡平而先遽言和，誠不知袞袞諸公將何以自解於昔日之號召衛國？亦將有何面目以見彼拋頭頗灑熱血為戡亂衛國而犧牲之烈士於九泉之下？其難二也。何况這一句含混莫明的話，在政府固然說了出來，中共尙無反應，而香港為中共先驅的所謂反政府派則巳代中共喊出決不妥協的呼聲，以示其勢必戰至最後勝利而後已，可見政府縱想但求『瓦全』而中共則已存心『玉碎』。其難三也。</p>
<p>頗聞孫院長在堅邀巨頭入閣之際，巨頭有以內閣須握和戰大權為其入閣之前提者，即此以親，孫閣之動向或將從希望獲得光榮和平這方面有所努力。果兩，又不能令人無疑。做一件事總該有一目的，何况組閣？孫內閣是什麽內閣呢？戰鬥內閣乎？和談內閣乎？抑亦戰亦和之內閣乎？不戰不和之內閣乎？不戰不和，決非辦法。亦戰亦和，也無此理。然則孫內閣受命於艱危之際，前途祗有二條可擇其一，非戰即和，非和即戰，魚與熊掌，不可得兼。就孫院長的談話來看，一則說『將繼續作戰』，再則說『絕對不投降』，三則說『波蘭捷克之覆轍可鑒』，四則說『政府勦匪具有決心，決不輕言妥協』，孫內閣應該是一個十足的戰鬥內閣了，然而為什麽又拖了一句光榮和平的多餘的話呢？須知光榮和平祗有從努力作戰中求之，無他道也！若謂僅靠說了一句『光榮和平』的話而就可以試探出一條和平大道來，那眞是奇蹟了。照我們的淺見，孫內閣今天之對於中共，正如當年英國之對於納粹，不做張伯倫內閣，就做邱吉爾內閣，並不能希望在夾縫中間做得出好文章的。</p>
<p>總之，誰不希望和平？誰又不希望光榮的和平？然而今天不必說，只須努力於革新政治，努力於革新軍事，努力於戰塲上振士氣，打勝仗，努力於大後方抑豪富，平民憤，則民心之歸向，如水之就下，光榮和平將不期其至而自至。不然，喊儘管喊，理也沒有人理，和平尙未得到，光榮先已掃地，究竟何苦來哉？而况，幸而如願以償，干戈早息，與中共相與論道，共圖治理，則中國未來的趨勢，亦不過為匈牙利波蘭捷克之續耳，光榮又在那裏呢？</p>
<h3>營業稅法修正草案　政務會討論通過　起征點由省市參照當地情形擬訂</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕財部以營業稅法施行已久，現因幣制改革，巳不適用，特擬具修正草案，送呈政院，廿二日政務會議中業已討論通過，卽送立法院審議。茲誌其修正要點如次：（一）起征點，由省市政府按照下列四種範團，參照當地經濟情形分別擬訂，經省市民意機關同意後，送由財都核定施行，甲，住商每月營業收入額，自金圓五百元至一千元，乙，住商每月營業收益額，自金圓一百五十元至三百元，丙，行商每次營業收入額，自金圓一百五十元至三百元，丁，行商每次營業收益額，自金圓五十元至一百元。（二）住商業業稅，按月申報，每三個月查定一次，現行營葉稅法第八條規定，住商營業稅每三個月查定一次，卽甲，乙，丙三月份之稅額，於丁月一次查定，於丁，戊，己三個月內分別繳納，是當月份之稅款須遲至兩個月後始能征收，現值地方財政困難，而營業稅為地方重要稅收，故改為按月申報，並按由報額繳納營業稅，但每三個月查定一次，多退少補，以應需要。（三）牙業行棧代扣代繳行商營業稅，查行商大多資本較厚，在銷售地點並無店面，多由牙業行棧介紹銷售，其營業稅容易偷漏，修正草案爰規定行商營業稅由牙業行棧代扣代繳，並仿所得稅法之例，給予百分之一之獎勵金，如不依照規定扣繳者，除限期責令賠繳外，並處以所漏稅額三倍至六倍之罰鍰，以專賣成，而杜隱匿。（四）調整罰鍰，現行營業稅法第十八條至二十六條，皆屬罰鍰規定，茲以幣制改為金圓本位，法幣罰鍰應行修正本草案，爰將違反稅法情節較輕者規定處一百金圓以下之罰鍰，其情節重大而原定處所漏稅額三倍至六倍之罰鍰，其逾限繳納稅款者，則加征滯納金。（五）罰鍰由稅收機關征收，現行營業稅法第二十五條規定，營業稅罰鍰由法院以裁定行之，但法院因民刑訴訟等案件繁忙，於營業稅罰鍰往往難於迅連裁定，致商人玩忽納稅之心理難以警惕，影響稅收甚大，迭據各省籲請，改由行政機關自行辦理，亟待設法補救，爰蔣罰鍰滯納金及停業處分，皆親定由市縣政府執行，但滯納稅款在三十日以上仍不繳納者，則規定由司法機關追繳之。（六）稽征規則由各省市自行擬訂，營業稅係由地方征收，為適應地方環境起見，太草案爰規定各省市在稅法及其施行細則之範圍內，得自行擬訂稽征規則，咨經財部核定施行，以利征收。</p>

<h3>制止荷在印尼軍事行動　美對荷施經濟壓力　下令停止援助荷屬東印度　美在安理會斥荷爲侵略者</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕美國今日停止馬歇爾計劃項下對荷屬東印度之援助，以待荷蘭對印尼共和國戰事之解決。經濟合作總署長霍夫曼已電令駐荷分署遵照辦理，據稱，此舉係與國務部充分磋商後決定，惟對荷蘭本國之援助則顯然無影響。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿二日電〕荷蘭代表范樂揚廿二日吿聯合國安全理事會稱，荷蘭政府將不問代價及後果，縱續在印尼作戰。范氏重申荷蘭之立塲，卽印尼戰事純屬內政問題，安理會無權干涉。安理會於廿二日上午舉行會議考慮荷軍之進攻印尼共和國。馬立克自柏林遄返巴黎，廿二日已出席安理會。美國態度强硬，力斥荷蘭為侵略者。范氏乃為荷蘭陳言，堅稱印尼戰事之唯一目的為「肅淸極端份子」。渠稱：「法律及治安必須得勝，吾人面臨憲慘之局勢，談判既吿破裂，荷政府乃採取必要之行動。」范樂揚又稱：印尼共和國政府頗依賴共產領袖，「故極受共產主義之影響，各方均知，印尼共黨與緬甸，馬來以及其他東南亞國家之共黨有緊密連繫·抑有進者，彼等均接受同一中心之指揮。」范氏演說九十分鐘後，總結荷政府之目標如下：「吾人將作戰以恢復印尼之眞正和平，然後吾人將儘速成立獨立之印尼合衆國，吾人將擁護林加蒂及倫維爾兩協定之原則，且將予以實施。吾人遵此途徑，不折不撓，決不半途而廢」。范氏指斥共和國破壞停戰令不計其數，「根據可靠資料，約有印尼軍一萬一千人分小股滲透過分界綫，刻在荷蘭陣地之後方。」范樂揚吿安全理事會稱：「恪遵聯合國憲章之文字精神，安理會無權過問此事。在憲章下，安理會僅能處理危及國際和平安全之案件。衆人皆知，印尼事件並不危及國際和平安全之維持。印尼之發展非國際和平之受破壤，而係內部和平之被破壞。鄰國諸如澳洲，印度及菲列賓對印尼問題之解決，極惑興趣，本人頗能了解，然此非安理會得干涉荷蘭王國內政糾紛之謂。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿二日電〕聯合國印尼調解委會廿二日以語氣憤怒之報吿一份致安理會，痛斥荷蘭政府無誠意和平解決印尼糾紛，而一方面假裝談判，另一方面則準備作戰。</p>

<h3>杜爾斯自巴黎歸國談　美蘇關係可改善　雙方爭執不致導入戰爭</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處紐約廿一日電〕杜爾斯頃巳自巴黎聯大歸來，相信聯合國中和平之展望，在過去一年中巳見增進。杜氏在巴黎聯大會談之後半部中，率領美代表團，上述意見，係渠於星期一自歐洲乘輪返抵此問後在記者招待會上表示者。</p>
<p>杜氏謂，『約一年前此時，余適自倫教外長會議歸來·該次會議之失敗，乃陰霾空氣與預測可能發生戰爭之原因。吾人曾經歷充滿緊張事件之一年，惟吾人並未領略戰爭，反之，本人認為在奠定和平基礎方面已獲有若干進展。過去一年中最有成果者，莫如過去三個月內巴黎聯大會議中之工作。將來猶有許多危險與困難，惟本人相信在巴黎會譏中，業已奠定建設性之基礎，對於尙存之困難當能以和平方法加以克服。某記者有以除言飼與決議外，上述基礎究屬何指相詢者，杜爾斯答稱，「本人對於言詞與決議並不輕視，以其往往能導致協調之行動。本人並不認為能與蘇聯早日成立任何協定，但不獲協議並不一定導往戰爭。信奉自由社會之國家，在團結一致方面頗有令人振奮之事實表現。國際間之諒解，卽係自巴黎聯大一類之會議中獲得者。共產領袖之基本觀點，與美國及西方國家之觀點如此不同，因此本人並不期待能迅速獲致協議。惟不協議不應以橫暴之方式加以表現，而目下在柏林，希臘，朝鮮與其他若干地方，正有人使用橫暴之方法」。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿一日電〕印尼共和國駐美全權公使蘇米特羅對記者宣布：荷蘭藉口恢復治安，其實荷蘭所轄境內現紛擾不靖。蘇氏聲明共和國政府今唯有以流亡為最後企圖，可能赴蘇門答臘指導戰爭。訪員問以印尼共和國政府將否有與共黨聯盟以抗荷軍之可能？蘇氏拒絕說明對此問題之立塲，僅謂共和國政府在兩月前猶遏制共黨之起事。蘇氏對安理會能否制止荷蘭之侵略，表示懷疑，並强調大局之關鍵全在華盛頓。蘇氏認印尼之各鄰國有組織國際軍團以抗荷軍之可能，並隱示印尼與荷蘭間未來之關係將大受今次事變之影響。末謂，余深信共和國必能由奮鬥中掙扎出來而為主權獨立之國家。</p>
<h3>東條等七戰犯　今晨絞決　在巢鷗監獄秘密執行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿三日廣播：東京訊，東條等七戰犯已於巢鴨獄內刑塲執行死刑。麥帥總部頃發表簡短文告稱，「遠東國際軍事法庭判處死刑之戰犯七名，業已於一九四八年十二月廿三日晨零點至零點卅五分間全部絞決。」文吿原文僅寥寥二十七字，而昔日姦淫擄掠無惡不作之帝國主義者，其一生遂吿結束。日本僧人半山曾為此七人作臨終祈禱。據半山稱，渠等係由一姓名不詳之美國刑吏執行絞決，渠等當年聲勢煊赫之際，因對宗教毫不重視，惟臨終之際則態度已變，「心地澄澈」。絞刑執行時，僅極少數曾宣誓嚴守秘密之軍官在塲監視，巢鴨獄前警衛極嚴。此次執行死刑時，費時極短，故此間人士推測，咸以為必係四人先行同時絞決，然後再同時絞決三人。各國記者曾屢次要求到塲採訪新聞，卒被拒絕。今日被處決之七人為東條英機·土肥原賢二（六十五歲）·廣田弘毅（七十歲）·坂垣征四郎（六十三歲）·木村（五十九歲）·松井石根（七十歲）·武藤（五十六歲）。</p>
<h3>荷侵入印尼　英態度灰澀</h3>
<p>甚至主張荷戰勝印尼</p>

<h3>荷如無美援　亦可長期作戰</h3>

<h3>土肥原板垣　臨死其鳴也哀　遺方强調中日應互助</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿二日電〕現在巢鴨監獄靜候執行絞刑之戰犯土肥原與板垣，近已立就遺囑，二人之遺囑皆以「對中日兩國之最後遺言」為題，其意殆係對中日兩國人民而言者。遺言現交由某日本僧人保管。盟軍當局巳允該僧於七戰犯執行絞刑前，為渠等作宗教祈禱。僧人遵土肥原板垣之囑，俟二犯死後始將其遺言發表。傳二犯於遺言中，除對中國人民致敬外，並强調中日兩國必須互相扶持，否則二國將問歸沒落。</p>

<p>渠等在一正式之公吿中稱，『如果蘇聯當局在現在或將來決定繼續保持四强間原有之協議，四强控制柏林當可能予以恢復。在蘇聯缺席期內，西方盟國將實施盟軍聯合總部之職權，雖然吾人暸解由於蘇聯之阻撓，聯合總部之決定在目前僅能在西區執行。」渠等之第一個決定，卽在分配煤斤，俾在聖誕節假期中有一日能使柏林西區整夭供電，此一日期將由德市府決定。據西方國家解釋，雖然蘇聯拒絕出席，聯合總部決非停止存在，由於經常會議之恢復，西方國家指出渠等當能加强西區之行政工作。</p>

<h3>港失事機殘骸尋獲　罹難屍體運抵九龍　中航專機今送家屬飛港料理後事　參議員邵永生亦遭不幸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司XT104號空中覇王機前晨自滬飛港，下午二時左右在距港十三英里之畢沙島觸山焚毀。失事機殘骸當晚在畢沙島山腰尋獲，機中乘客廿八人及機員五員，空中小姐兩人，證實全部罹難。所有屍體昨日下午巳自失事地點運至九龍以便收殮，中航公司定今晨派專機一架載送罹難乘客等家屬去港料理後事。</p>
<p>中航公司昨公佈罹難乘客名單，其中不乏知名之士，除中航公司副總裁昆丁·羅斯福，中委前中宣部長彭學沛（卽彭浩徐）及國大代表中央社上海分社主任馮有眞外，有電影界名導演方沛霖，本市市參議員邵永生，（購票時用張壽名議），前蒙藏委員會委員長羅良鑑，平津名媛朱四小姐及朱九小姐（卽吳朱津筠，朱洪筠，為朱霽靑將軍之女）等人物。彭學沛係應馮有眞之邀赴穗籌劃出版中央日報廣州版事宜，馮本己購有赴廣州之雙引擎客機機票兩張，但彭為安全起見，堅主搭乘空中覇王機，乃將赴廣州機票退去，另訂赴港座位，不料反而失事罹難，誠不幸之至。市參議員邵永生受景福衫襪廠之委託，赴港接洽業務，原定於三日後卽返滬參加本屆市參議會·朱四小姐之夫吳敬為中航公司總經理劉敬宜之稔友，此次夫婦同機畢命。朱九小姐係東北軍閥吳俊升之媳，與其姊同安有聲名於平津社交界。</p>
<p>空中小姐　一語成讖</p>
<p>罹難之空中小姐黃蘇梅現年廿三歲，其父黃鴻鈞為ABC內衣公司經理，家道富有。據中航機航組人員談稱：黃平日對工作極為熱心，此次起飛之前，公司派車往其家中接至機塲，黃在機中曾對司機閒談，表示最近連續飛行，頗感疲倦，但因對工作有興趣，故不願吿退，並稱：「雖死在機上亦甘心」。不意竟一語成讖。另一空中小姐朱人嫻，現年廿一歲，為故國學大師章太炎之外孫女。</p>
<h3>全部罹難名單　乘客機員卅五</h3>
<p>茲誌全部乘客及機員名單於後：旅客：王胡津瑗，王文　，趙國華，陳毅（商），韓明夷，羅良鑑，屈冰，屈蠻，方沛霖，昆丁·羅斯福，黃慎凡，徐振銓，吳敬安，吳朱津筠，吳朱洪筠，廖德泉，陳董淑芬，榮伊仁，馮有眞，彭浩徐（卽彭學沛），王穆宗，張壽（卽邵永生），陳百橋，忻達夫，楊海霖，陸陶為琛，陸弟弟，羅孝芬。</p>
<p>機師：Sunby，副機師歐自克。報務員P．Kao，。工程師F．Chang及C．N．Lo　。空中小姐：黃蘇梅，人嫻。</p>
<h3>冒重霧低飛　致觸山焚燬　港督電告英政府　失事機不聽勸告</h3>
<p>該機失事原因及善後間題，中航公司當局昨派該公司董事高大經飛港調查辦理，民航局方面已電知該局廣州站就近派員赴港調查一切情形。唯據聯合社香港廿二日電，港督葛量洪廿二日曾電吿英國殖民部稱，中國航空公司空中霸王號飛機，「不顧香港控制塔之勸吿，在重霧氣候中飛行」，致在畢沙島失事焚燬。證之另一港電稱，廿一日香港氣候惡劣，此說似屬可信</p>
<p>至外傅該機於起飛前曾加修理，認為引擎或有問題一說，據滬航空界人士談稱：觀諸該機能順利飛抵香港，在距離機塲僅剩幾分鐘航程時突然失事，似並非因機件失靈所致。據一般推測：失事原因可能為駕駛員之一時大意，同日中航公司赴港空中霸王機與一〇四號同時飛出者尙有一〇三號及一〇六號，皆先後安全抵達。駕駛失事機之機師　佩（Sunby），雖為航空老手，抗戰期間且曾屢越駝峯，但據悉此人素來極喜低飛，出事處之山頭高五百餘呎，可能因大意而致撞觸。桑佩本已定於本月廿九日携其妻兒離華返美此次為共在華最後一次來回飛行</p>
<p>屍體行李　遍佈山坡</p>
<p>〔聯合社香港廿二日電〕中航自滬飛港霸王號XT-104機在畢沙島山坡失事焚燬，機中三十五人當塲全體殞命。其中燒焦屍體十四其今晨尋獲橫在山頂，四具橫在機灰中，中有一具想係昆丁羅斯福，均定於廿一二日運來香港。警察及航空公司職員二十人廿二日全晨在山邊收拾屍體及行李等雜物。當時震力甚猛，全體乘客多英明大難臨頭卽己身死屍體遺物及機件散佈面積，達半英里。</p>
<p>客臂已斷　錶猶未停</p>
<p>發動機四具有兩具拋至三百碼外，機件無一完整，卽機尾亦已成白灰一堆。惟一乘客折斷之臂所備手錶，仍在走動。據今日到塲察看之飛械駕駛員稱，失事機飛行時速約在一百哩以上，飛行過低，致右翼觸及島邊五百五十四呎高之巖石，立卽起火燒毀。</p>
<p>〔本報香港二十二日電〕中航機失事地點之火石洲（卽舉沙島），距機塲僅六分鐘航程，高五百英尺，機撞山腰。乘客屍骸午後由警押運返港。</p>

<p>治安當局獲悉此種情形後，以時值戒嚴期間，非特破壞宵禁法令，抑且有礙治安，乃急由警察局派大批保安警察隊及騎巡隊，前往設法將羣衆驅散。但羣衆為淘金所迷，均不願散去，警察方面騎巡隊揮動鞭棍，保安警刺刀上鎗，羣衆則此散彼聚，鼓噪呼喊，始終不肯遠離。雙方僵持良久，一時形勢非常緊張。嗣後警察源源增援，警備部糾察隊亦開到，惟因缺乏統一指揮，且無決定之驅散方針，先則將外灘之羣衆逼離各銀行大厦，集中於沿江，繼驅向北走，又驅入南京路，折向北至四川路，然後大部份驅至蘇州河以北，時已午夜十二時許矣。繼復由騎巡隊將九江路河南路一帶之羣衆向西驅散，時忽大雨傾盆，可憐羣衆盡成落湯之鷄。在奔逃之時，婦孺老弱被踐踏受創者有之，呼男喊女，大哭小喊，其情其景，慘不忍睹。然其中猶有不少人乘隙避入沿馬路里弄之中，更有擁入中央銀行後門內躲避，以期於黎明解嚴後繼續搶先，此無數羣衆迄今晨二時記者截稿時止，猶未能肅淸，而預料今日之兌金行列必愈演愈烈，秩序之混亂，更可預卜，如兌金辦法不設法改善，其後果誠不堪設想也。</p>

<h3>地產交易一落千丈　跌價割售受主仍少　影響興建新屋運動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據地產業中人談：地產交易，自整個戰局趨勢逆轉後，卽沉入呆滯之境·與八一九前實際市價比較，最慘時一般房地產已打一對折。最近因和平空氣迭起，局勢略轉穩定，一般房地產價格始稍有起色，惟亦已較前打一七五折至八折之數。據悉：房地產價格慘跌聲中，首當其衝者厥為一般房地產公局。蓋該項公司在經管時期，卽有兌出所持之金釗者，亦多補進房地產。目前各公司業務雖屬協淡，然日常開支，仍不得不予難持。故地產價格雖跌，仍不得不忍痛割售，而受主甚少。又在房地產價格慘跌聲中，本市興建新屋運動，大多已陷於停頓狀態中·蓋現時建築新屋，物料仍不康，而人工則較前特貴。落成後又不易脫手，且有己造就之新屋被人無償佔住者，使投資建屋者望而却步。</p>
<h3>研究足印　破獲龍華命案　先後捕獲三犯　供出殺人原因</h3>
<p>本月廿日，龍華鎮天鑰橋農民於麥田內發覺身着軍服無名靑年死屍一案，經警備司令部飭員偵查後，已於前日下午全部破案，兇手四人，除一人正予緝拿外，餘三人均全部就逮訊辦中。</p>
<p>查死者係二二六旅六三四團五連少尉排長方堃，警備司令部稽查處長何龍慶聞訊後，卽飭人卫警備第一大隊隊長夏濂偵查緝兇，該隊第三隊隊長閰錦文奉命後，當卽會同有關人員按址前往調查，經騐屍後，發現死者頸項有極鮮明之勒痕，並於屍首附近發覺橡膠底足印數處，該隊長等根據上項綫索，當卽偵悉天鑰橋兵工署上海龍華修理廠上士排長鄧星橋所着之膠鞋與該處足印雷同，經斷定該鄧星橋為此案之兇犯後，當將其逮捕一鞠而服。據供：尙有該廠修理員郭橋及該廠藝衛隊二等兵呂星義·羅山林等三人，亦為共犯，然經飭員前往拘捕時，三犯已聞風逃逸，該警衛隊隊長陳世澤似不無責任。前日下午警備部押同該犯前往出事地點查騐時，不意於天鑰橋左近復將上述三犯中之呂星義·郭橋二人緝獲，據該犯等供、勒死方堃之原因，係彼在靑島時，死者曾竊取彼等黃金五兩六錢，及照像機等物，渠於最近來滬後，曾向之索取不遂，因而勒死云云。現警備司令部除一而繼續嚴訊該犯等，以期全案得以大白外，至在逃之羅山林，正嚴令緝拿中。</p>

<h3>各國聖誕景象</h3>
<p>耶穌聖誕原是耶教與天主教徒的一個紀念節日，起初祇行於歐西，其後因耶教與天主教的教徒日衆，聖誕節也就日形普逼，幾已成為一個世界性的令節。每年的聖誕前夕，世人舉行慶祝，送聖誕禮物，寄發聖誕賀卡，在歡地度聖誕夜，情狀的熱烈，眞是有增無已。</p>
<p>英國人幾乎把聖誕節視為　一個「團圓節」，闔家圍坐一桌共進晚餐，便是遠離家園不獲趕返的，他的家人也必在餐席上為他祈禱祝福。「聖誕布丁」更是每一個英國人在那一天晚上必定進食的點心。</p>
<p>又因為英國人素來是最講究禮貌的，所以在聖誕節上，送禮物，寄賀片，十二分起勁。以一九三五年來說，單是倫敦一地，共發出聖誕賀電二十餘萬通，以全國計算起來，其數字委實驚人。</p>
<p>英國的王室，當每年聖誕節日，例必撥款救濟各貧民窟中的貧民。各地的教堂，也都紛紛集款，用以招待貧民，歡度聖誕。英國的兒童，更有將自己的玩具拍賣，得款捐贈教堂舉辦貧民福利事業的·英國人在聖誕節這一天，人類的同情心，可說發揮無遺了。</p>
<p>美國人民是愛好享樂的，聖誕正是他們的一個「狂歡節」。</p>
<p>各處的夜總會中，通宵達且，始終擁擠得水洩不通。一夜之間，僅紐約市一地，消耗的酒類便已達十萬桶左右·百老匯街本來便是一條繁榮的街道，到了聖誕節的晚上，更有「酒街」之號。</p>
<p>波蘭也是一個耶教的國家，却有奇特的儀式，聖誕前夕，每家人都要舉行一個宴會，並不是一家團聚的聖典，其實含有深厚莊嚴的宗教意味。</p>
<p>每家人都把一切晚餐用具預備好了，但是非等待第一顆星在天空出現，不能開始用餐。所以波蘭的聖誕晚餐，名叫「星餐」，也稱做「守夕晚餐」。</p>
<p>餐室裹燈燭輝煌，他們因為紀念救主耶穌是在馬糟裹降生的，便用些草放在桌面上，用白布蓋着，然後全家的人就座，由家長拿起一個盛了一枚很大的餅的盤子，口裏祝福，並說一段簡短的言辭，大意是願在座諸人與上帝和一切的人相安，於是也就將餅切開，在座的人連僕人都各得一份，分餅之後，各人將自己的一份約略吃一些，其餘彼此交換分享，以作彼此親愛的表示。</p>
<p>然後，彼此祝福，合唱彼蘭的聖誕歌，開始晚餐。</p>
<p>餐後，孩童都被領到另一間屋子裹，外面走來一個老人，叫做「星光老人」，與小孩一一問答，若是小孩答錯了，便要受老人的呵責，末了，便將從「星境」帶來的賞品，給那對答正確，行品良善的孩子。</p>
<p>伯利恒，耶穌基督誕生的聖地，在那裹度聖誕更有特殊的意義。附近各地的信徒，特地趕到聖城去度聖誕，遠處的人，也往往乘聖誕節的時候，來瞻仰那救主的誕生遺跡。雖然馬房和馬槽已沒有了，但向往之心，總不會减低的。所以在伯利恒，聖誕節前數天，就有許多客地的人到來。從歐洲來的英國人，法國人，從東歐來的彼蘭人和匈牙利人，東非的埃及人，東方的印度人，以及附近的土耳其人，阿拉伯人，還有世界各處的猶太人，都是紛紛來朝謁那聖地，形形式式，彷彿開了人種展覽會。</p>
<p>在伯利恒度聖誕，是看不到銀皚皚的白雪的，在大街上，都舖着潔白的大理石，遠看也有幾分像銀色世界，顯得莊嚴而肅穆。在聖誕節前夕，大小教堂都擠得滿滿的，人數雖多，但沒有喧鬧的聲音。婦女們帶着黑紗的面罩，好像阻止了她們的談笑。這一回禮拜，差不多要到第二天的黎明才止。</p>
<p>教堂的建築，有一間狹小的地下室，望下去黑沉沉地。從一小扶梯下去，繞幾個灣，才到這間地室。那裹點着五十三盞光明的銀燈，照耀得很明亮。那裏象徵着耶穌誕生時所睡的馬槽，供着耶穌的聖像和十字架。在禮拜快完的時候，大家排着隊，順序從小扶梯下去，讀那用拉丁文寫就刻在銅牌上的耶穌誕生的故事。</p>
<h3>SAM’Ｘ</h3>
<p>聖誕節，英文作Chrristmas，Christ的意義是基督，mas是誕生的解釋。現在有好多人寫作X’mas，把X代作C　rist，究竟是怎樣一會事呢？</p>
<p>關於X’mas，有兩種解釋。一種說X的讀意，和Christ相近似，而寫起來則簡便得多。另一說法，X的形狀有些像十字架，可以作為耶穌基督的象徵。</p>
<p>其實那兩種說法都不對的，那X的來源，是淵源於希臘文。在希臘文中的X，等於英文中的Ch；Christ一字，寫作Xriitos，簡寫卽為Xt。在十六世紀時，希臘文流通的範圍，日益狹小，但在許多人的腦海中，認為懂希臘文是榮耀的，Xt仍常常沿用着。推而廣之，把Christian也寫成Xtian，聖誕節也就寫作X’mas日了。這個習慣，一直到今天還沿用着。</p>
<h3>冬至話舊</h3>
<p>俗稱耶穌聖誕節為外國冬至，各國莫不舉行熱烈慶祝，但是中國冬至，也受國人的重視。</p>
<p>按照習俗，冬至節前一日，親朋各以食物相饋遺，提筐擔盒，充斥街道，俗呼冬至盤。節前一日，俗稱冬至夜，這一晚，家家設宴飲，謂之節酒。女嫁而歸寗在室的，這天晚上，必定趕返壻家·不論貧富，也必市食物以享社先，間也有懸掛祖先遺容的，儀式多於尋常節日，所以有「冬至大如年」之諺。吳縣風俗多重冬至節，因此又有「肥冬瘦年」之稱。</p>
<p>中國田農老者，他們以為從冬至前夜的暖熟潮濕，可以領測新年的睛雨。諺曰：「冬至前做濕五風，安閒快樂到芒種」。俗以冬至前後逢雨雪，主年夜晴，若冬至晴，則主年夜雨雪。所以又道：「乾淨冬至臘踢年」。</p>
<p>今年的中國冬至，適在聖誕前兩日，中國冬至與外國冬至聯袂光臨，吃完了本國的冬至夜飯，完了「冬至暖房」的盛典，再過兩天，又可以作一年一度的「聖誕狂歡」了。</p>

<h3>聖誕點滴　聖誕老人坐飛機</h3>
<p>美國東部沿海一帶，每年聖誕節，總有一架飛機在天空飛過。凡孤寒的人家，飛機上就有包裹，繫在降落傘上丟下來。包裹裹面，有糕餅，有糖果，有香烟，有書籍，有衣服。下面的人家，聽見了軋軋的機聲，便跑出來迎候，在二十世紀的科學世界，這飛機是波士頓一個大商人委託，每年一次，替他分送聖誕禮品的。</p>
<h3>免費購貨</h3>
<p>在台拉斯城，有一個精明冷靜的老猶太人，開着一家百貨店，招牌是路德。這位猶太老闆，倒不是一個慳吝的人，很體諒窮人的。每年聖誕節，窮苦的人可以到他店裹挑選幾樣日用品，不要付一個小錢。這辦法已經行了三十年了，每年來領取東西的，總有一萬人以上。路德商店在聖誕節那一夭，從朝到晚，擠得水洩不通，夥計們忙不過來，別的店裹的人，也都來義務效勞。</p>
<h3>三個聖誕島</h3>
<p>世界上有三個以「聖誕」命名的島嶼。一個在印度洋中爪哇之南二百哩的地方，在一六四三年一艘英國商船瑪麗號因遇暴風而發現的。第二個在太平洋中近赤道的地方，是一個孤獨的珊瑚小島，是在一七七七年由庫克船長發現的。這兩個島發現的日子，都是在聖誕節那一天，所以名為「聖誕島」。在大西洋的法國沿岸，靠近累島的地方，也有一個「聖誕島」，那島的歷史已不可考了，但推測起來，想也是在聖誕節那一天發現的。</p>
<h3>聖誕迷信</h3>
<p>聖誕節前夕，月明星稀，明年瓜果大熟。若是烏雲蔽月，或逢着大雨，明年吃不到瓜果，酒也喝不到了。耶誕降雪，明年田禾豐登。天黑，牛奶的產量必豐。聖誕節黎明若有大風，則六畜遭殃。聖誕節有雷電，夫必奇寒</p>
<p>聖誕那天，最先進門的東西，靑色最好，進來的人是男人，才會帶幸福來的，連動物也是公的比母的好。聖誕節若逢星期三，這是最不群之兆，明年有戰禍，疫厲流行，火山爆發，天災人禍，接連而來。</p>
<h3>聖誕樹</h3>
<p>聖誕樹的創始者，名聖　倫丁，是德國愛爾薩斯地方赫斯拉其森林中的一個老人。他很愛兒童，兒童也愛他。在聖誕節前兩天，他想在聖誕節舉行一個兒童招待會，表示慶祝。可是他很窮，又買不起玩具。</p>
<p>上一天下着大雪，那天天氣仍冷，但陽光很好。聖樂倫丁早晨起來，在樹林中散步，無意中看見一棵小杉樹，身上遮滿了白雪，枝上還掛着長長短短的冰柱，受那陽光照着，反射出來，美麗極了。那老人靈機一動，把樹掘起來，栽在盆裹，將果子蜜糖和麵粉做的十字餅，掛滿了樹枝，還有許多小臘燭。</p>
<p>到了聖誕節晚上，他敲着小鐘，兒童們都來了。看到樹上五光十色，燭光輝煌，十分高與·於是唱歌，跳舞，狂飲了半夜，方始盡興散去。從此以後，每逢聖誕節，家中都備一枝小杉樹，稱為聖誕樹。</p>
<p>在美國加里福尼亞洲的國立公園中，有一棵很高的松樹，它的高度，相當於一座二十層樓的大厦，樹幹也有七八圍粗。一九二五年，美國規定這棵高的松樹，作為美國國家的聖誕樹。這算得是世界上最大的聖誕樹了。此後每逢聖誕節，總有許多人到這棵聖誕樹下，舉行聖誕儀式，在一片琉璃世界的山上，高唱着聖誕之歌。</p>
<p>在加里福尼亞洲的南部，阿爾泰特那地方，也有一排很有名的聖誕樹，那是整齊而美麗的松柏，共長一哩。遠在一八八二年，有一個叫華德柏雷的旅行家，遊歷到印度，攀上世界屋脊的喜馬拉耶山。他在那裹發現了許多美麗的松柏，動人極了。於是把種子帶到家中，親自種植，後來又由他兩個兒子細心培護，一棵棵地移植，佈滿全園，此卽有名的聖誕樹。現在華德柏雷早巳去世了，田園也荒蕪了，只剩下這一排松柏，留供後人瞻仰。</p>

<h3>銀根鬆·買氣旺　食米繼續上揚　雜糧交易轉盛油市疲退</h3>
<p>食米昨到貨仍湧，但產地較堅，銀根鬆泛，買氣趨旺，市價轉挺。南市白粳三五〇元，漲十元，薄稻三五〇元，挺五元，早稻實銷較暢升至三四五元，上漲十五元，羊秈三四五元，市况平平。其他自元，陰元，秈米，一致微秀五元至十元不等。北市白粳洋秈均為三五五元，各挺二十五元，其他各檔，亦均吿挺十元至二十元。昨日到貨二市塲合計一五一九七石五斗，內南市塲七九七四石五斗，北市塲七二二三石</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>市氣仍堅，交易暢旺，老車粉以昨日止升過高，仍站一四七元原盤，兵船粉亦以一三九元原價做開，交易頗盛，其他雜牌粉一致轉昇六七元不等。</p>
<p>麩皮微秀，福新大包八一元，早豐大包八〇元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>以到貨轉稀，交易轉盛，市價一致挺起，黃豆升起十餘元，漢口乍豆一九〇元，紅糧亦秀十五元，苞米微升五元，黃渡苞米一六七元。芝蔴以洋裝不動，獨趨平穩，漢口白蔴三四〇元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>先堅後退，開收相差懸殊，開市洋裝有納，銀根亦鬆，故本廠豆油初開一〇八〇元高盤，成交尙多，惟後市急退至一〇三〇元。靑島江北吉桶生油一一五〇元開盤，收市回降五十元，生菜油開一〇二〇元，收市穩站千元關，亦漲起十元。吉桶小車蔴油一〇二〇元開，收市回至九六〇元，微秀十元，熟菜油七八〇元，亦秀六〇元。</p>
<h3>保險業保費　昨改收現金</h3>
<p>上海市保險商業同業公會，經理監事聯席會議決議，自廿二日起，各項保費，一律改以當日現金繳付。因過去保費曾有延遲至二三個月未曾付淸者，該業所受損失頗鉅。聞此次改以現鈔繳付，謂聊以挹注云。</p>
<h3>僑匯掛牌昨再昇　外匯證先堅後疲</h3>
<p>中央銀行僑匯掛牌，昨日又升四元，計為六十四元。外匯移轉證先堅後疲，開盤五十六元，有不就乏供，嗣在各方吸收下，再升漲至五十九元成交。經出口商乘高吐售，始吿回降，最後五十七元買進，五十七元賣出，結果較前軋漲一元七角半。</p>
<p>又昨日銀根稍戢，市塲利息日拆每千元一二元至十五元，合月息三角六分至四角五分。現鈔仍充沛。又本市各行莊前因市上暗息高出銀錢業同業欠息之日拆每千元十五元甚多，故另徵手續費，現因市塲利息步降，且反低於同業欠息，故自卽日起，各行莊對該項手續費，一律暫停收取。</p>
<h3>台幣對金圓券匯率　爲三五〇元兌一元</h3>

<h3>鼓勵出口業務　恢復打包貸款</h3>
<p>據進出口業消息，停息已久之出口打包貸款，卽將恢復，中央銀行已在籌備開貸中，因當局有鑒於近來出口業一蹶不振，出口移轉證乏人問津，卽平時出口最多之豬鬃桐油腸衣等物，現亦减少至十分之九。長此以往，出口業將吿停頓。為求振興出口起見，故再恢業打包貸款，以資鼓勵。惟據出口業表示，近來上海出口减少，實為交通阻塞之故。自產區購得之出口貨，無法運滬，故出口貸款雖恢復，出口業務仍難樂觀云。</p>

<h3>茶市漲風甚熾</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，雖天不作美，但內銷茶與外銷箱茶，因買戶依然靑睞，致過程猶若得水之魚，價格方面，亦以執戶繼續居奇堅售，漲風一再蔓延。茲據業中人云：最近　洲摩洛哥等地，對於針眉秀眉各項低檔花色，大有蠕蠕復動之勢，惜市存益枯，交易恐未若理想之順利，而市氣則仍將翱翔雲書。</p>
<h3>糖市續俏</h3>
<p>食糖昨日市况繼續堅俏，業外游資擁入，合糖公司配量减少，人心頓時好轉，更因年邊節屆，各地添辦不絕，本街納胃尤暢，趨勢續好。45號車白精晨開五六〇元，開後納意盛旺，供售頓稀，檯面一致哄托，喊價迭見高峯，一度做至五九〇元，收市人心稍軟，買氣轉淡，市復回退十元，升三〇元，粗砂五四五元，亦升四五元，其餘興白赤等均帶升一成半。</p>
<h3>捲烟外銷日减</h3>
<p>本市實銷每月僅二萬箱</p>
<p>據捲烟業權威人士談稱，香烟市價不振，主要原因仍在缺乏實銷。平時銷路，一，華北方而約三萬多箱，二，西北一萬多箱，三，長江流域及津浦綫三萬多箱，四，滬杭路及浙閩一萬多箱，五，華南一萬多箱，本市實銷二萬箱。刻下華北銷路已斷，廣東因受洋烟傾銷，亦較滬價為低。西北無法運往，長江缺乏船隻，津浦綫地方不靖，浙閩銷路亦差，能有把握者，僅太市每月二萬餘箱，亦因受囤貨出籠影響，需求不多。一般捲烟批發零售商，則以利息過昂，但求迅速脫手，不願多進貨，遭受損失，故烟市無法升漲。</p>
<h3>細紗一致軋高　棉布初昂後平</h3>
<p>棉紗升沉不一，客地去化仍呆，本街需不就亦不多，結果細紗一致軋高，粗紗互有榮辱。</p>

<p>布市旋昂卽回，龍頭細布初開創五七〇元之新高峯，是以各方買意堅强，價一度喊俏，近午利空消息頻傳，人心不振，突起賣風，喊價步步鬆落，最後以五四〇元之低檔收市，結果較前午收高五元，但較下午塲外喊價則挫一〇元，收後多頭斬售未已，聞五三〇元尙有人賣出。</p>
<p>四君子元嗶嘰由五七〇元開出後，曾抵達五八〇元新高，收前半小時做小至五二五元，收市為五三〇元，終挺一〇元。金蓮妙舞與雷峯塔之嗶嘰各升二百元左右，四君子元直　開盤五六五元，最低五四五元，收市五五〇元，終漲一八元，餘布雖比前軋高，但脚地甚為虛軟。</p>

<p>生絲市况走勢盤檔，外匯證市價彼動甚少，人心無任何刺激。外銷貨昨日做開不多，市無上落，內銷貨各帮納胃仍淡，去銷不暢，交易未旺，惟因執戶扳持，喊價欲小不小，振亦乏力，趨勢平穩。Ｄ級78匀度晨開一九〇〇〇元，優級零担一八五〇〇元，嗣聞業外紗布先高後回，絲織廠納胃不健，市况回落一千元，收市與上日午收略升數百元。</p>
<p>綢縀市况昨日波動甚劇，人心初平後堅，喊價高後又軟。美亞被面初做一一二〇〇元，喊後買氣仍濃，浮多爭吸，散戶跟縱，喊價節節上升，創一二五〇〇元新高峯，最後各方逢高力吐，散多獲利紛了，價見回挫，收市一二三〇〇元了結，升一五〇〇元。大誠嗶縐，四維呢，大偉呢，均帶升三·五元。</p>

<h3>港組織防衛隊　六個單位暫定六千名</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>〔本報香港十八日航訊〕港督葛量洪繼嚴詞警吿共黨的演說後，十五日在香港立法院討論「成立香港防衛隊法案』中，又發表一個重要聲明，解釋組織香港防衛隊的必要。於是「香港防衛隊」這個名辭立刻在市民的口頭上打轉。</p>
<p>這眞是「無獨有偶』也可說得是「難兄難弟」—香港和上海不先不後也在進行組織一支民衆自衛武力。由於時勢的需要，港中輿論已推許這是「英明的措施」要香港防衛隊的組織，據港督宣佈，計分六個單位，（一）海軍隊，（二）陸軍隊，（三）空軍隊，（四）輔助服務隊，（五）婦女服務隊，和（六）司令團。組織有伸縮性，視環境需要而定，預料在一九四九年至一九五〇年的財政年度內，將可寡集六千人。換句話說，在初步計劃內，香港防衛隊的實力，暫定為六千之衆，全部經費約需六七百萬港元。</p>
<p>港督指出，「為使市民在戰時或緊急時間都有獻身務服之機會，各種國籍人士，也可參加。入隊宣誓的辭句，卽使非英籍人士，亦無損其原有國籍地位，而司令團還有繙譯負之設，可見防衛隊的主力，將是我們的僑胞，就是不懂英語也無妨的這比戰前香港義勇軍以英籍人員為限的規定開明得多。戰前香港義勇軍，計有陸軍約九百名，海軍約四百名，太平洋大戰爆發後，擴大編制，人數共增至三千名。</p>
<p>香港英文南華早報在本月十三日論「香港安全」的一篇社評中，指出香港政府對過去默身服務的男女，規避責任，已在民氣上發生不良影響。因此，港督這個聲明便明白說出：凡參加軍事行動的隊員，將照英軍正規軍的薪額發薪，另加當地生活津貼費。又稱：凡加入海陸空軍的，必要時得奉調在香港以外服務，但陸軍人員如不願離港者，可在入隊時聲明。又說：凡「參加防衛隊的男女，將犧牲其大部份時光，甚或犧牲其生命，以保衛香最慢者之一。每人憑證可以買到一定數量之食物，包括牛油·肉·糖·牛奶等等。我的看法，他們是以「洋芋」代替我們中國人北方的麵和南方的米。普通的人每日三餐之外，另有三數次的飲茶，時間在上午十時左右與下午四時左右，也許還有人在夜間十點及淸晨起床前也有一次「茶」，這些「茶」有時是帶有吃點心的性質。通常的情形，星期六星期日下午都是冷食，一般有工作的人大約中午都是在飯館吃飯。飯館分為若千種類，價格不一，普通人所去的大約每頓限於二先令三便士。</p>
<p>居住</p>
<p>這也許是標準遠較中國爲高的物質生活之一。一個家庭或則有一所小洋房，或則也有一個目成單位的「平面」，（Flat這個字，甚不易譯成中文，實際上所謂「平面」者，大約包括休息室·臥室·廚房·厠所等而言）戰前這裹有一種分期付款的買屋方式，政府也有各種房屋的建築，依成本出租。如果拿「住」作標準，我們與英國無法比較，一個普通工人所住的，大約在中國卽使混了一二十年的老教授，也未必有此「福氣」。最大的原因，我想是由於英國有一個長期安定的局面，雖經兩次大戰，但在英倫三鳥上始終沒有敵人能夠登陸。</p>
<p>交通</p>
<p>這方面，我看大部份人借助於火車，公共汽車與地道車，交通網在這個國家裹，自然是很發達的。私人自備汽車目前似乎不大普遍，其原因似乎在於購置汽車之不易。英國的汽車廠正努力於輸出，而無法兼顧國內市塲，因此想買汽車幷非易事。汽油受政府管制，如果拿汽油的價格來講，相當便宜，大約一加崙為英幣二先令三便士，一部優良的小汽車每加崙可以走三十英里。西洋人似乎很少不會開汽車，更少雇用司機，因此，自備汽車未必是一件奢侈的事，問題大約在於汽車之價格及其購置之不易，同時汽油的限制也相當嚴格。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<p>一個普通的英車人，據我所撩解的，他們的生活相當的規律化。早上出門工作，下午回來，晚上也許出去娛樂，也許在家裹聽聽無綫電裹的音樂演講之類。在這裹，自備收香機者每年要繳納一鎊的使用費，聽說去年廣播公司收了一千多萬鎊，英國的人口大約是五千萬左右，因此平均是四個人有一架收音機，這對於英國人民，有甚大的好處。普通的家庭，有的全家白天都出外，或工作，或上學，也有一些主婦不出外工作的。英國家庭的主婦，我說實在話，大部份是很值得欽佩的。這裹人工很貴，所以很少的家庭雇用「工人〕，卽有，也常常是「部份時間」的，或則每天來若干小時，或則每週來若干次，來做一些主婦們所認為必須找人帮忙者。像中國那樣僱個女工一天二十四小時住在主人家裹者，大約是絕無僅有的事情。在原則上講，這裹的主婦大約是負担了一個家庭的全部「行政」，像整理房屋，買菜煮飯之類，她們確是十分辛苦。當然，有一點是她們比中國婦女佔便宜的，就是這裹的設備較之中國為佳，若干工作，也易於為力。</p>
<p>安定</p>
<p>英國人的生活方式，有些地方雖未必是東方人所能習慣，但是由他們已習慣者看來，大致是很值得欣羨的。戰爭給予英國以若干損傷，也减少了英國人民若干的享受，但是在另一方面看來，許多事情是戰爭所問接給予英國人民的好處。政府對於糧食的津貼，使收入較少者得到不少的補助，戰時稅制的變更，以及若干管制的收效，它多少縮短英國人民問貧富之距離。目前，英國有若干經濟上的困難，但是大致而言，全國人民極少失業，在過着有紀律而水準仍遠較中國為高的生活。他們的老百姓，至少由我們外國人看來，很少煩惱。政府幾乎負責了所有人民一切生活上的問題，道些，與他們國內政治之長期安定有關。當我每次注意到英國人的生活時，我總懸念着我們國內的生活，我意識着中國人民生活水準之提高，必須具備一個條件，卽政洽之安定。這也許就是每一個中國人民所應努力的目標。</p>
<p>刻苦</p>
<p>末了，我願意說的，在我沒有到這裏以前，我以為這裹一定是和上海一樣，奢侈，浪費，但是在我在這裹住了若干時期以後，我認為英國人值得我們注意的，物質或許還是其次，而他們的刻苦，樸質，實事求是的精神，沉着而不誇張的作風，足資我們的矜式。</p>
<h3>句容加強自衛實力　經費武器就地籌措</h3>
<p>〔本報句容廿日訊〕蘇省府為加强各縣自衛實力以應非常起見特令飭各縣成立地方團隊，以資自衛，記者為明瞭該項組織情形，特往訪陳縣長天秩，據悉本縣卽將成立一個保安團，所有組織情形，純以採取地方性為原則，省方僅負督導指揮之實，而經費武器也由地方籌措。至組織編制，先行將縣保安大隊，改編一個營，各鄉鎮常備自衛班成立一個營，一俟經費和槍枝有了着落，再另行擴編一個營。所有團長一職，省峯巳委派本縣橋頭鎮袁鎮長德亮担任。</p>
<p>全縣十八歲至四十五歲男子，決分兩期組訓完畢，其第一期由各階層嚴格督訓以來，行將期滿，收效頗宏。茲為展開地方性武器起見，特令飭每一被組織之民衆，各配刀或矛一件，以資自衛</p>
<p>陸軍訓練司令部知職靑年招訓處，頃派副處長楊任翔氏來縣，假縣參議會招考十八歲至二十五歲智識靑年，集送赴台灣受訓，聞自本月十二日開始報名迄今（二十）日止，投考者極為踴躍，其中尤以豫州臨中學生為般。</p>
<h3>英國人民的生活　樸質·安定·實事求是</h3>
<p>— 本耿</p>
<p>〔本報倫教十日航訊〕這篇報吿，不是專著，而是一些「雜談」。記者希望從這篇報吿，能使國內讀者明暸戰後英國人民的生活而知所警惕。</p>
<p>衣服</p>
<p>據說，以前的英國是很講究「衣服」的，但是在現在看來，似乎也祇是整齊淸潔而已。卽使你在人口九百萬之倫敦的最熱鬧街道上，也並不容易看到奇裝艷服。除了正式的宴會以外，普通的男子常常是一件粗呢上身，一條法蘭絨褲子，可以四季常穿。至於穿整套西裝的，其料子與式樣，也都是很普通的。如果要說有什麼講究的話，也只是他們對於襯衫領子，較之中國人之穿西服者更注意淸潔罷了。也許是由於氣候的關係，除了普通衣服之外，一件晴雨兩用的大衣，似乎是人人皆有，而且很少不隨身携帶或穿着的。道裹的夏季，也不常使人們有炎熱之感。今年夏季，據我記憶所及，除了七月下旬曾經有三數天很熟以外，經常的溫度似乎都不過在華氏表六七十度左右，這對於衣服可以四季常穿，似乎有相當影響。婦女們所穿的衣服，也幷沒有使我們感到「奢華」之處。「撲實」這是這裹衣服所給我的印象，這個情形也許與目前之衣服管制有關。去年的情形，每一個人身上所穿着的，從頭到脚，大約除了帽子之外，完全受政府的管制。一個人每月有四「點」購衣證，但是一套西服卽須廿六點購衣證。最近的管制情形比較放鬆。五月間除了每人每月應有的四點以外，又加發了每人十二點，鞋子領帶之類已不再受管制。若干衣服雖則仍須「點」數，但其所需的點數已開始减少，例如西裝一套，由廿六點减為二十點。英國雖以紡織業著名，但是上好的料子，大約都是作為出口之用，國內所能買到的，似乎都是很樸實者。我想衣服管制的放鬆，可能使人民多有一些新衣，而未必就使這裹的儉撲風氣為之改變。</p>
<p>飲食</p>
<p>飲食方面，質與量均受管制，但最近也稍為放鬆一些。例如麵包與本國製造的果子醬，已不須再憑證購買。據我們所知，英國政府對於糧食一項，有相當的津貼，所以食糧價格也許是戰後所有物價上漲港。吾人不但確保彼等之薪津充足，且須要再為彼等着想」，設置各種適當的遊樂塲所和衛生設備，使各隊員除服務外，並收身心健康與愉快之效。</p>
<p>參加輔助服務隊的男女，不必受軍事訓練，他們祗担任民防工作，但倘有戰事，則又當別論。</p>
<p>「香港防衛隊法案」，共分六部，合三十七條，其中第二部為「緊急時期港督宣佈動員令之權力」，至關重要。預料明年一二月間，將予以全部通過，而香港的民衆武力便正式誕生，社會安全將增添一重保障了。</p>
<p>港督葛量洪是一個高瞻遠矚的政治家，最近他一連串的聲明和行動，已獲一般市民廣大的擁護與贊許。香港政府與良善的人民合作，這是維持治安防止共匪擾亂的最好辦法。</p>

<p>〔本報信陽十八日訊〕石達開詩有句日：「五志未酬人已苦，中原處處有啼痕」，降至今日，堪為一般苦難的河南人民寫照。</p>
<p>淮北戰事，如火如荼，匪軍傷亡數字之大，駭人聽聞。據頃由鄭州來此客商談：僅汴·鄭·兩地，在近旬以內，巳　集匪軍傷兵三萬餘人，匪中原軍區為急圖補充，在豫西·豫北·豫東·各縣，近已放棄「參軍」濫調，四出拉丁，凡十四歲以上四十五歲以下之男丁，均不能免，豫東及魯西南因接壤蘇皖邊境，已成為匪軍前進補給基地。</p>
<p>三抽五索　交易停頓</p>
<p>在上述近卅縣之土地上，人民所有之牛車騾馬，已被匪搜索一空。各地糧行，因人民所有食糧已在三抽五索下吿罄，交易完全停頓，貧苦農民，餓斃於豫東商邱民權道上者到處可見。在豫魯交界地區，因劉匪曾在此進出，不下百餘次。該地嬰孩之售價尤慘，女孩體重十斤，僅可易取紅薯七斤，或小米三市斤。賣兒　女之老農，終日對荒蕪的土地頻頻流淚，但一見匪女政工人員到達「宣尉慰」時，則强作歡顏，學唱秧歌。</p>
<p>處理靑年　煞費心機</p>
<p>從北來的流亡學生及商人口中，可以看到匪方改變政略後，對於陷區靑年之處置，已煞費匠心，而其手法之狡黠與毒辣，亦值注意，為時約在鄭汴棄守前二月，劉匪的中原軍區某次檢討會議曾決定了一個「寗打大九九」的毒辣算盤，以後赤旗到處，抓到靑年學生在每百人中留下九十九個攻城，放走一個去攻心。於是在陷區以內，人們可以看到成千成萬的靑年學生被騙「參軍」，投下血海，不轉瞬間，成為砲灰。而在「大九九」算計下獲釋的少數靑年，在南逃的途中，在巧妙的安排下，居然到一站有吃有住，有陌生人代為會鈔，好像歡送他們出脫，於是這些為數不過百分之一，僅僅白吃了幾個饅頭，白喝了幾碗開水的小嘴巴，不知不覺輕悄悄地將類此毒素，免費帶過國軍的前綫，帶到政府的後方，帶到若千鬆懈的心防陣地。這作用可不能說小，如果教育當局淡忘了這些甚飢甚渴的小嘴巴，不多給他們幾枚饅頭，儘打「小九九」，那就不夠談鬥爭，更說不上什麼總體戰了。</p>
<p>平漢沿綫　南北現况</p>
<p>殺人盈野的戰爭，是殘酷的，可是在殘酷的現實後面，假使隱藏着若干更殘酷的假面具，壞東西，老百姓可就苦不堪言了。現在單就這靜靜的平漢鐵路南北兩方談：北邊的人民，因為匪軍不時逼迫獻槍獻糧，恐怖那所謂八個月後的總淸算，走得動的都在想盡方法紛紛向湘·鄧·逃跑。南邊的老百姓，生活在鐵路兩側較遠遠地區的，因為受不了少數軍風紀較差地方團隊的要索和驚嚇，也在忙着逃。於是在漢口·信陽之間，因煤荒關係，每天僅開一班的尋常快車，每天都是擠得水洩不通，顯得不正常。</p>
<p>生死兩難　刦數一塲</p>
<p>據一位河南省參議員談：這年頭兒做中國的老百姓，眞是生死兩難。在駐馬店以北或以東眞空地帶的遂平，西平，上蔡居住的人民，因為是兩不管的地區，經常是禍不單至，今天你來，明天他往，都免不了一塲刦數。過往販賣烟葉棉花的商人，在北邊納過八種什麽自衛·公益捐稅後，到了南邊，照樣又得完過八道。不過在政府管轄下，稅率較輕，匪區雖說准許少量棉花和許昌烟葉出境，但抽稅很兇，棉花要抽徵百分之四十以上，烟葉竟抽征百分之二百，還要額外勒索，這且不談，回頭再看看那長僅百餘公里的一條信潢公路沿綫人民生活，因為近來有少數土匪不時攔刦商車和人民，使信漢沿綫各地物資交流的速度大為减低，也顯出憔悴。信潢一帶是豫南的魚米之鄉，老百姓的安全感，也較為敏銳，他們對張軫主席的看法認為是安定的象徵，所以希望也很切。</p>

<h3>晨友盃籃球賽　錦標突起變化　晨友功虧一簣　慘遭健樂毒手　回力倖運重獲問鼎機會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕晨友盃籃球賽，昨晚屆錦標最後關頭，晨友八職八勝，遭逢健樂，作最後一戰，以完成其覇菜，豈知事與願違，功虧一簣，健樂老將大顯威風，以五十一比三十分擊敗晨友，上半時健樂以廿一比十七佔先四分。健樂雖克晨友，仍無奪標希望，已二度失敗，間接則予回力重獲問鼎之機會。晨友回力如今各為八勝一負，將擇期重決冠軍。靑年會健身房中，昨晚熱鬧非凡。</p>
<p>上半時　拉鋸大戰</p>
<p>六一刻兩軍登塲，劉荷生鄭志芳執法，晨友何增傳其俠王蓉生王炳福梁雄標臨陣，健樂吳成章張良雄張顯崙傳金聲顏師魯應戰。兩軍接觸，張良雄犯規，何增一罰而中，王蓉生繼之命中，三比零前領。健樂顏師魯建功，梁榮標立刻回敬，健樂張良雄罰中，旋又於籃下托入，五比四健樂首度超前。晨友叫停。其俠罰成各五，嗣後兩軍演成拉鋸，各六各八迭成平手，至各十四後，晨友以十六比十五再度領前。但曇花一現，健樂又吿活躍，上半時終了，健樂以廿　一比十七佔先兩球。</p>
<p>下半時　晨友沒落</p>
<p>休息過後，兩軍原陣作戰，張良雄破籃，健樂氣燄不减，最友諸將，力圖竄犯，，無奈球運不佳，屢擲不入，於是一路落後，差分遂超出十關，至卅九比廿七後，王蓉生五次犯規畢業，史久全入替，同時叫停密議對策，果然一時稍見好轉，王伯文等略有得分，但健樂亦不肯放鬆，故於大局仍鮮變化，至終塲前一二分鐘，晨友傅其俠亦退休，季有崑下陣，時失分既多，攻勢亦難振，法定時間完畢，健樂以五十一比三十分勝晨友，晨友尙須與回力再見雌雄·戰績如下：</p>

<p>最後一塲，甲組另幕春茂戰新生，前者技高一着，新生自難逃厄運。兩軍接戰，春茂佔得先籌，新生並不自餒，竭力應戰，比數並不差遠，上半時結果春茂以卅二對廿一前導。易籃再戰，春茂依然順手，新生無法抬頭，但戰情愈戰愈劇烈，新生力拚，至為賣力，迨終塲收軍，新生以四十三比五十八敗於春茂。</p>

        <h1>1948.12.23</h1>
<h3>Sun Ke Took Office at the Executive Yuan This Morning; Convened the First Executive Yuan Meeting; Full Cabinet List Officially Released; Dong Xian Guang Denies President Agreed to Resume Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Director of the Government Information Office, Dong Xian Guang, issued the following statement to United Press on the evening of the 22nd:</p>
<p>"Director of the Government Information Office, Dong Xian Guang, categorically denies the claims that President Chiang has agreed to resume peace talks and decided to step down when a peace agreement is reached. The aforementioned report is absolutely inaccurate." United Press had reported on the 21st, based on absolutely reliable sources, news regarding peace talks. Dong's denial is in response to this.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The full list of Sun Ke's cabinet members, after being approved by the Kuomintang Central Political Committee, was immediately appointed by the President. The new cabinet is scheduled to take office at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 23rd, and the first Executive Yuan meeting will be held at 10:00 AM. The cabinet, which had been delayed for nearly a month, has finally been formed.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] It is reported that Sun Ke has decided to appoint Ni Jiong Sheng, the Director of the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, to the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] After the list of Sun Ke's cabinet was announced on the 22nd, it attracted great attention from all parties. An authoritative figure stated that the biggest changes in Sun Ke's cabinet are twofold: first, many of the selected ministers are new faces; second, the political councilors hold significant weight. Among the heads of ministries and commissions in the Weng cabinet, only Xu Kan, Yu Da Wei, Gu Zheng Gang, Guan Ji Yu, Pang Song Zhou, and Sun Yue Qi are reappointed. Liu Wei Chi has been changed from Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Bai Yun Ti has been promoted from Deputy Chairman to Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. In addition, Wu Tie Cheng, Hong Lan You, Xu Yong Chang, Mei Yi Qi, Zhong Tian Xin, Lin Ke Sheng, Mei Ru Ao, Wu Shang Ying, Dai Kui Sheng, and others are all "new faces," and many of them are serving as political officials for the first time. As for the political councilors, in addition to Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhi Zhong, Chen Li Fu, and Weng Wen Hao, who were strongly invited by Sun Ke, former Vice President Zhang Li Sheng and Minister of Education Zhu Jia Hua were also invited to remain in the cabinet as political councilors. Almost all leaders of various factions within the party have been included, creating a cabinet of leading figures representing party unity. The selection of political councilors fully demonstrates that they will be the center of decision-making. It is also learned that Mei Yi Qi's appointment as Minister of Education was a last-minute decision. The list on the evening of the 21st still had Li Zheng. Because Mei arrived in Nanjing on the 21st, he was asked to take the position. However, Mei stated that if the situation in Beiping improved, he would return to Tsinghua University and therefore insisted on declining. However, authoritative figures believe that he may be persuaded to withdraw his resignation.</p>
<p>Sun Ke</p>
<p>Wu Tie Cheng</p>
<p>Zhang Qun</p>
<p>Weng Wen Hao</p>
<p>Zhang Zhi Zhong</p>

<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Does Not Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Youth Party Will Hold a Central Executive Committee Meeting Today</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, This City] A spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party reiterated yesterday the party's decision not to join the cabinet, stating that the party will continue to be an opposition party and dedicate itself to national affairs, and hopes that the new cabinet will alleviate the people's suffering. The spokesperson said that the party chairman, Zhang Junli, had submitted suggestions to the President regarding major national policies in mid-November.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The line-up of Sun Ke's cabinet still reserves the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and a position for a political councilor for members of the Youth Party to participate. It is heard that Sun has invited Zuo Shunsheng to continue as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and Chen Qitian to serve as a political councilor, but neither has yet responded. Both left on the night train on the 23rd for Shanghai to attend the party's Central Executive Committee meeting on the 23rd in Shanghai to decide whether to stay or leave.</p>
<h3>Last Meeting of the Weng Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Weng cabinet held its last meeting at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, chaired by Vice President Zhang Li Sheng. The meeting proceeded very quickly. Weng took office on June 1st, serving for a total of half a year. After his resignation was approved at the end of November, the affairs of the Executive Yuan were maintained by Vice President Zhang until now. (The agenda of the Executive Yuan meeting is published on page 2)</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and Central Political Committee; President Chiang Presided in Person; Li Peiji and Liu Jianqun Nominated as Candidates for President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan; Shen Yi Resigns, Teng Jie Appointed Mayor of Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] President Chiang personally presided over the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and Central Political Committee meetings on the morning of the 22nd, passing the nominations for candidates for President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, as well as the list of the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and the full cabinet. The meeting was held at the Central Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd. The Central Standing Committee was convened first, passing the nominations of Li Peiji and Liu Jianqun as candidates for President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, and Wu Tiecheng as Vice President of the Executive Yuan, before adjourning. The Central Political Committee was then held to discuss the cabinet list. The meeting proceeded extremely quickly. Sun's original list was divided into two parts. The non-Kuomintang personnel, such as Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, Director-General of the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics Pang Songzhou, and Minister of Health Lin Kesheng, were reported by Sun. The remaining personnel were discussed, except for the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The original Minister of Education was set to be Li Zheng, but after discussion, it was changed to Mei Yiqi. It is heard that Sun personally visited Mei on the morning of the 22nd to invite him to take office, which was quickly approved. The vacancies for the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and one position for a political councilor will be left for the Youth Party to join the cabinet. The following cases were then approved: (1) Weng Jingtang, Chairman of the Public Functionary Disciplinary Committee, requested retirement due to illness, and the vacancy was filled by Xie Guansheng. (2) Xie Guansheng concurrently serves as Secretary-General of the Judicial Yuan. (3) Shen Yi resigned as Mayor of Nanjing, and Teng Jie was appointed as his replacement. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, will be extremely busy after taking office as Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and will hardly be able to manage the affairs of the Party Headquarters. It is heard that President Chiang is considering his successor.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Tomorrow; Mutual Election of President and Vice President</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The 31st meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 24th. The agenda may be changed at that time to mutually elect the new President and Vice President. According to the agenda decided by the Procedure Committee, the report includes the Executive Yuan's request for deliberation on the amendment to Article 8 of the Martial Law and the draft amendment to the Organizational Regulations of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The discussion items include several review reports by the Economic and Legal Systems Committees on the draft organizational regulations of the subordinate agencies of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the review report by the Health and Legal Systems Committees on the draft organizational regulations of the Quarantine Institute of the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] According to qualified sources, the Kuomintang nominated Li Peiji and Liu Jianqun as candidates for President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. Judging from the current situation, Liu's Vice Presidency is expected to pass. Although Li once served as a member of the Control Yuan, a member of the Henan Provincial Government, and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and acted as Chairman of the Province, he has been away from the political stage in recent years. Last year, he was elected as a member of the Legislative Yuan from the first district of Hebei Province. Li is currently recuperating in Beiping. If elected, he will need a government special plane to pick him up.

<h3>New York Times Article Calls for; US to Clarify China Policy; Continued Aid Must Not Allow China to Be Red</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] The New York Times published a special article today calling for the immediate clarification of the United States' policy towards China. The newspaper pointed out that the decision to provide $275 million in non-military aid to China was made long before China was plunged into the current crisis. The newspaper continued: The current situation urgently requires more frank words. The United States cannot allow China to be turned red, and the consequences of China's turning red cannot be viewed with indifference. The newspaper insisted that the continuation of US aid is an important factor for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, New York, 22nd] A "New York Times" editorial on the 22nd, in view of the military situation in China, called for a revision of the United States' policy towards China. The newspaper said: "The United States has spent much effort and money in preventing the communist conquest of Greece. The crisis of the communist conquest of China is far greater than that of Greece. We cannot be indifferent, nor should we be concerned about the possibility of saving China from communist rule through a united government in which the communists will occupy major positions, as we have very clear experience of the consequences of such a compromise." "On the other hand, we cannot argue that the current Chinese government has or has not met the conditions attached to continued US aid. The decision of China's leaders and government is a matter for China, not the United States, but if continued US aid is an important factor for the Chinese people, then of course, the United States can inform the Chinese people of the United States' views on a government of this union, representing China's liberal organizations, as the best hope for resisting further communist attacks and later recovering lost territory."</p>

<h3>Editorial How to Obtain Glorious Peace?</h3>
<p>The new cabinet that was "summoned a thousand times" finally landed yesterday. Since President Sun was ordered to form a cabinet, it has been almost a month, with many consultations and near abortion, but it was finally able to bring together the giants yesterday to form a list, seemingly becoming a cabinet unanimously supported by the entire Kuomintang. This cannot be said to be Sun's success. Moreover, on the eve of the formation of the new cabinet, President Sun announced to foreign reporters that his cabinet was a fighting cabinet that would continue to fight until glorious peace was achieved. This startling statement gave the new cabinet, which debuted with fanfare, a sense of being "extraordinary." As the saying goes, "A hungry person is easily fed, and a thirsty person is easily given drink." The common people, struggling with hardship, cannot help but place endless hope on hearing the tune of "glorious peace."</p>
<p>However, even though the call for glorious peace has been made, how to obtain glorious peace is something the new cabinet may not have any immediate solutions or confidence in. It's as if the tune is well-chosen, but whether the singer has a beautiful and smooth voice is another matter. Therefore, even though the common people harbor full of expectations, whether what they expect can become a reality is another question.</p>
<p>Let's be honest: Is there anyone in the world who doesn't want to live a happy and peaceful life? Is there anyone among the Chinese people who fought the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan who doesn't want to see the dawn of peace soon? However, if peace can only be obtained at the sacrifice of freedom, then what value does the peace of slaves have? Moreover, "all feasts must come to an end," and there is no war that does not eventually return to peace. Where there is war, there must be peace; and both sides in the war hope for a glorious peace. Therefore, although "glorious peace" is a beautiful term that can win people's hearts without losing face, it is actually superfluous nonsense.</p>
<p>Moreover, the question becomes: What exactly is the connotation of glorious peace? I am afraid that everyone will have a different opinion. As far as the warring parties are concerned, the first party often believes that peace on these terms is glorious, while the second party does not; the second party believes that peace on those terms is glorious, while the first party does not agree. So how can both sides be made to believe that it is a glorious peace? That is the first difficulty. In the past, the government called for the Chinese Communists to be traitors, and suppressing the rebellion was for the sake of defending the country. If it is now truly eager for peace, without waiting for the rebellion to be suppressed before speaking of peace, I really don't know how the honorable gentlemen will explain themselves to the past calls to defend the country? And how will they face the martyrs who shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for the sake of suppressing the rebellion and defending the country under the Nine Springs? That is the second difficulty. Moreover, even though the government has spoken this vague and unclear phrase, the Chinese Communists have yet to respond, while the so-called anti-government faction in Hong Kong, which is the vanguard of the Chinese Communists, has already shouted out that it will never compromise, indicating that it is determined to fight to the final victory. It can be seen that the government wants nothing more than to preserve its "integrity as a tile," while the Chinese Communists are determined to "shatter like jade." That is the third difficulty.</p>
<p>I have heard that when President Sun was firmly inviting the giants to join the cabinet, some giants took the premise that the cabinet must have the power of war and peace as their prerequisite for joining the cabinet. Based on this, the direction of Sun's cabinet may make some efforts in the direction of hoping to obtain glorious peace. However, this also cannot help but make people doubt. There should always be a purpose for doing something, let alone forming a cabinet. What kind of cabinet is Sun's cabinet? A fighting cabinet? A peace talk cabinet? Or a cabinet that is both fighting and peaceful? A cabinet that is neither fighting nor peaceful? Not fighting or peaceful is definitely not a solution. Both fighting and peaceful is also illogical. Therefore, Sun's cabinet, which is ordered in a time of crisis, has only two paths to choose from in the future, either war or peace, either peace or war; one cannot have both fish and bear's paw. Judging from President Sun's remarks, on the one hand, he said "will continue to fight," on the other hand, he said "absolutely will not surrender," on the third hand he said "the repetition of Poland and Czechoslovakia is a lesson to be learned," and on the fourth hand he said "the government has the determination to suppress bandits and will never lightly compromise." Sun's cabinet should be a full-fledged fighting cabinet, but why did he add a superfluous word of glorious peace? It must be known that glorious peace can only be sought through efforts in combat, and there is no other way! If it is said that a path to peace can be explored simply by saying a word of "glorious peace," then that is truly a miracle. In our humble opinion, Sun's cabinet today is to the Chinese Communists as Britain was to the Nazis back then. It must either be a Chamberlain cabinet or a Churchill cabinet, and it cannot be hoped that a good article can be written in the cracks.</p>
<p>In short, who doesn't hope for peace? Who doesn't hope for a glorious peace? However, there is no need to say it today. Just strive to reform politics, strive to reform the military, strive to boost morale on the battlefield, fight victorious battles, strive to suppress the rich and appease popular anger in the rear, then the return of the people's hearts will be like water flowing downwards, and glorious peace will come naturally without being expected. Otherwise, shouting as much as you want, no one will pay attention, peace will not be obtained, and glory will be swept away first, so what is the point? Moreover, fortunately, as wished, the fighting will end early, and together with the Chinese Communists to discuss the Tao and jointly plan governance, then the future trend of China will be nothing more than a continuation of Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Where is the glory then?</p>
<h3>Draft Amendment to the Business Tax Law Approved by the Political Affairs Council The Starting Point for Taxation Will Be Drafted by Provinces and Cities with Reference to Local Conditions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing 22nd telegram] The Ministry of Finance believes that the implementation of the business tax law has been long, and now it is no longer applicable due to the currency reform. It has specially drafted an amendment and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. It has been discussed and approved at the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 22nd and will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. The main points of the revision are as follows: (1) The starting point for taxation will be drafted by the provincial and municipal governments according to the following four scopes, with reference to local economic conditions, and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation after being approved by the provincial and municipal public opinion organs. A. The monthly business income of merchants residing in a permanent business location is from 500 to 1,000 Gold Yuan. B. The monthly business income of merchants residing in a permanent business location is from 150 to 300 Gold Yuan. C. The amount of income from each business transaction for travelling merchants is from 150 to 300 Gold Yuan. D. The amount of income from each business transaction for travelling merchants is from 50 to 100 Gold Yuan. (2) Business tax for merchants residing in a permanent business location shall be declared monthly and assessed once every three months. Article 8 of the current Business Tax Law stipulates that the business tax for merchants residing in a permanent business location shall be assessed once every three months, that is, the tax amount for March, April, and May shall be assessed at once in June and paid separately in June, July, and August. The tax payment for the current month must be collected two months later. Now that local finances are difficult and business tax is an important local tax revenue, it has been changed to monthly declaration and payment of business tax according to the reported amount, but assessed once every three months, with refunds for overpayments and additional payments for underpayments, to meet the needs. (3) The business tax of travelling merchants shall be withheld and paid by the trade and barter businesses. It is found that most of the travelling merchants have relatively thick capital and do not have stores in the sales location. Most of the sales are introduced by the trade and barter businesses, and it is easy to steal and evade business tax. The draft amendment stipulates that the business tax of travelling merchants shall be withheld and paid by the trade and barter businesses, and a reward of 1% shall be given, following the example of the income tax law. If they do not withhold and pay according to the regulations, in addition to being ordered to pay the taxes within a time limit, they shall also be fined three to six times the amount of the evaded tax, to ensure specialization and prevent concealment. (4) Adjustment of fines. Articles 18 to 26 of the current Business Tax Law are all provisions on fines. Now that the currency system has been changed to the Gold Yuan standard, the fines in legal tender should be amended. This draft stipulates that those who violate the tax law in minor circumstances shall be fined less than 100 Gold Yuan, and those who violate the tax law in serious circumstances shall be fined three to six times the amount of the evaded tax, as originally stipulated. Those who pay taxes overdue shall be subject to a late payment surcharge. (5) Fines shall be collected by the tax authorities. Article 25 of the current Business Tax Law stipulates that business tax fines shall be implemented by court ruling. However, the courts are busy with civil and criminal litigation and other cases, and it is often difficult to make prompt rulings on business tax fines, which makes it difficult to alert businessmen to the psychology of neglecting tax payment and greatly affects tax revenue. It has been repeatedly requested by the provinces to change to administrative agencies to handle it by themselves, which urgently needs to be remedied. It is stipulated that fines, late payment surcharges, and suspension of business shall all be determined and executed by the municipal and county governments, but if the tax arrears are not paid for more than 30 days, it is stipulated that the judicial organs shall recover them. (6) The rules for tax collection shall be formulated by the provinces and cities themselves. Business tax is collected by the local government. In order to adapt to the local environment, this draft stipulates that the provinces and cities may formulate their own tax collection rules within the scope of the tax law and its implementation rules, and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation to facilitate collection.</p>

<h3>Letter of Impeachment Against the Young Company from the Supervisory Committee, Continued from Yesterday's First Edition</h3>
<p>(丑) Preliminary Handling of the Case by the Competent Authority: Upon receiving a report forwarded by the Lujiawan Sub-Bureau on September 29th, the Shanghai Police Bureau immediately instructed Ji Dechun, the head of the investigation team of the Economic Police Squad, along with team member Mao Xinfu and others, to rush to investigate. Simultaneously, the bureau reported the matter by telephone to the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office. That office stated that the Young Company had already submitted an English inventory list, and instructed them to retrieve it and check against the actual stock. Mao Xinfu and others then, together with Chen Zhenhua, the deputy director of the finance department of the company, Gao Wenhui, the warehouse manager, and others, checked the inventory against the list. However, the units recorded on the English inventory list were sometimes counted by bottle and sometimes by piece, and most of the goods in the warehouse were packed in wooden boxes, making it impossible to verify them without opening each box. Among them, there were over two thousand boxes of Western medicine and no less than one hundred boxes of concentrated cod liver oil, which were still stored in the air-conditioned room. Part of the concentrated cod liver oil had already spoiled, indicating that it had been stored for more than a year. The team members only made a general check, and then affixed seals to the wooden boxes. Secretary Jiang and Deputy Director Chen of the company even claimed: "This case has been closed, and the sealed materials of our company will be unsealed soon, so there is no need to issue a custody receipt." The team members then reported the investigation to Team Leader Cheng Yi Kuan on October 4th, who forwarded it to the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office on October 8th via a telegram from the Shanghai Police Bureau. After arriving in Shanghai, Zai Wei and Yue Guang went to the police bureau and the social bureau to review the case files, and together with the original handlers, rushed to the company's warehouses to conduct an on-site inspection. The next day, they sent a telegram to the Shanghai Police Bureau, stating: "This case should be handled by your bureau in accordance with the regulations for this general material registration and inspection. If there are any violations of the regulations, they should be handled according to law, and we hope to be informed of the handling progress." This is the process of handling the case by the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office from the date of its occurrence to October 20th. (寅) Re-investigation: After arriving in Shanghai, starting from October 12th, they successively visited the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai District Economic Control and Supervision Office, the Shanghai Police Bureau, the Social Bureau, the Transportation Control Committee, and the Jianghai Customs Office to inquire about the case. They also accompanied the original handlers to the company's warehouses for on-site inspections, and met with Kong Lingkan, the chairman and general manager of the company. According to him, the company was registered and established in April of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), with a capital of 100 million yuan. In July of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the capital was increased to 1 billion yuan, divided into one million shares, of which Kong Lingkan held 249,000 shares. The company mainly engaged in import and export trade. In order to clarify the exact dates and actual quantities of the company's imported goods, and whether the import exchange settlement was legal and whether there were any improper substitutions, Zai Wei and Yue Guang supervised Xue Dulie, an auditor from the Ministry of Audit, and personnel dispatched by the Shanghai Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit, together with Wang Xiangpu, the team leader of the action team of the Economic Police Squad dispatched by the Shanghai Police Bureau, to request the company to provide the general ledger, subsidiary ledger, and import exchange settlement ledger. The company only submitted a copy of the English inventory list submitted to the Economic Control and Supervision Office with added dates, and a list of foreign exchange already received. It refused to hand over other important account books, making it impossible to verify them. Kong Lingkan also avoided meeting them, and Chen Zhenhua, the deputy director of the finance department, claimed: "The company was established not long ago, the accounts are incomplete, and a comprehensive investigation is quite complicated, so it is inconvenient to hand them over," repeatedly refusing. Zai Wei and Yue Guang sent separate letters to the Shanghai Police Bureau and the Municipal Government, requesting them to immediately investigate and report back according to their authority. By October 30th, the company submitted an English inventory list, customs cargo import tax payment receipts, and a transcribed list of foreign exchange already received (from June 5th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946) to October 5th of the 37th year of the Republic (1948)) to the Municipal Government for review. Mayor Wu sent Counselor Lin to conduct a review item by item together with Xue Dulie, an auditor from the Ministry of Audit, and agreed to open the wooden boxes to inspect the inventory. They also cooperated with Zhang, the deputy director of the police bureau designated by the Municipal Government, to conduct random checks on the materials stored in the wooden boxes. In fact, the company had three to four thousand boxes of inventory, and the types of goods were no less than three to four hundred. After a month had passed, it was inevitable that some goods had been moved. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of this random check. Now, we will briefly summarize the randomly checked goods as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Goods that are prohibited from import and goods that are temporarily suspended from import include: (1) Ninety-three boxes of cosmetics (among which, in addition to the discovery that flour is prohibited from import, the rest are also on the list of suspended imports), (2) 2,848 pieces of glass raincoats, (3) 1,915 pieces of glass headscarves, (4) 55 glass handbags, (5) 2,960 glass toothbrushes, (6) 594 dozens of glass combs, (7) 45 silk summer clothes, (8) 405 boxes of foreign wine, which were said to have been purchased from the Shanghai American Transportation Company in August of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), (9) Five boxes of woolen curtain cloth, (10) Six boxes of woolen goods, (11) 1,293 pairs of rubber shoes, (12) 994 golden safety razors, (13) 26 glass plates, (14) 122 glass baby clothes, (15) 744 silk undergarments, (16) 306 sets of fountain pens, (17) 197 pairs of baby shoes, (18) 53 mirrors, (19) 2,624 glass teacups, (20) 655 glass suspenders, (21) 168 travel bags, (22) Two boxes of woolen odds and ends, (23) 799 glass belts, (24) 22 handbags, (25) 2,957 pairs of glass women's shoes (the above seven types are said to have been taxed before the promulgation of import and export regulations).</p>
<p>(2) Daily necessities include: (1) Approximately 1,900 bags of 95 tons of sugar, (2) 274 boxes, 68 barrels, and 132 cans of kerosene.</p>
<p>(3) Industrial raw materials include: (1) 170 barrels, 205 boxes, 200 bottles, 23 boxes (each box contains 4 dozen and 46 cans) of various pigments, (2) 8 large and 48 small barrels of caustic soda, (3) 32 barrels and 379 pounds of gold powder, (4) 348 sheets of steel plates, (5) Approximately 6,000 kilograms and 30 of steel bars (including 120 kilograms of stainless steel), (6) 64 boxes of galvanized iron sheets, (7) 320 barrels and 66 boxes of varnish, (8) 104 barrels of Vaseline (including 4 barrels of white Vaseline), (9) One box and ten sheets of raw leather and cowhide, three boxes and one hundred and sixty sheets of sheepskin, (10) 380 sheets of glass leather, (11) Seven rolls of cigarette paper, (12) 25 boxes of copper wire, (13) Two boxes of sulfuric acid, (14) Seventeen boxes of lacquer powder, (15) Fourteen barrels of white medicine.

<h3>U.S. Applies Economic Pressure to the Netherlands to Stop Military Action in Indonesia; Orders Suspension of Aid to the Netherlands East Indies; U.S. Accuses Netherlands of Being an Aggressor in the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] The United States today suspended aid to the Netherlands East Indies under the Marshall Plan, pending the resolution of the Netherlands' war against the Republic of Indonesia. Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman has cabled instructions to the branch office in the Netherlands to comply. It is said that this action was decided after full consultation with the State Department, but it apparently has no impact on aid to the Netherlands itself.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Netherlands representative Van Royen told the United Nations Security Council on the 22nd that the Netherlands government will continue to fight in Indonesia, regardless of the cost and consequences. Van Royen reiterated the Netherlands' position that the Indonesian war is purely an internal affair and the Security Council has no right to interfere. The Security Council held a meeting on the morning of the 22nd to consider the Dutch military offensive against the Republic of Indonesia. Malik returned to Paris from Berlin and attended the Security Council on the 22nd. The United States took a tough stance and strongly accused the Netherlands of being an aggressor. Van Royen pleaded on behalf of the Netherlands, insisting that the sole purpose of the Indonesian war was to "eliminate extremists." He said: "Law and order must prevail. We are facing a catastrophic situation. Negotiations have broken down, so the Netherlands government has taken necessary action." Van Royen also said that the government of the Republic of Indonesia is quite dependent on communist leaders, "so it is greatly influenced by communism. It is well known that the Indonesian Communist Party has close ties with the communist parties of Burma, Malaya, and other Southeast Asian countries. Moreover, they all receive instructions from the same center." After speaking for ninety minutes, Van Royen summarized the goals of the Netherlands government as follows: "We will fight to restore true peace in Indonesia, and then we will establish an independent United States of Indonesia as soon as possible. We will uphold the principles of both the Linggadjati and Renville Agreements and implement them. We will follow this path unswervingly and will not give up halfway." Van Royen accused the Republic of countless violations of the ceasefire order, "According to reliable information, approximately 11,000 Indonesian soldiers have infiltrated in small groups across the demarcation line and are now behind Dutch positions." Van Royen told the Security Council: "Adhering to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council has no right to interfere in this matter. Under the Charter, the Security Council can only deal with cases that endanger international peace and security. Everyone knows that the Indonesian events do not endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. The development of Indonesia is not a disruption of international peace, but a disruption of internal peace. Neighboring countries such as Australia, India, and the Philippines are very interested in resolving the Indonesian issue, which I fully understand. However, this does not mean that the Security Council can interfere in the internal affairs of the Netherlands."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] The United Nations Indonesia Mediation Committee sent an angry report to the Security Council on the 22nd, denouncing the Netherlands government for not being sincere in resolving the Indonesian dispute peacefully, while pretending to negotiate and preparing for war on the other hand.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Around Yogyakarta; Indonesian Leaders Call on the People to Implement a Scorched Earth Policy; The Government of the Republic Still Performing Its Duties in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast from Batavia: The Dutch Supreme Command announced that the Dutch army occupied the airport in Bukittinggi, the capital of the Republic of Indonesia on Sumatra, without resistance, and said that the airport was not damaged and could be used immediately. In central Java, the Dutch army occupied the Tegal sugar-producing area between Yogyakarta and Solo.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast from Batavia: Indonesian Republican broadcasting stated that Yogyakarta and its surrounding areas are still engaged in fierce battles, and several cities in Java are burning. Armed uprisings are brewing in Cirebon, Brebes, and Tegal in western Java, and in Malang and Surabaya in eastern Java.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st, Associated Press] According to the news agency of the Republic of Indonesia, Indonesian radio broadcast at 14:30 (Greenwich Mean Time) that the Indonesian government is still performing its duties in the capital. The sender was the Sumatra Committee Office of Indonesia, and the receivers were the representatives of Indonesia in Singapore, New Delhi, and Bangkok. Also, the word "capital" was not explained in the telegram.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Batavia, 22nd] Dutch military operations are shrouded in mystery, and telegrams sent by foreign journalists are subject to censorship, so the truth is difficult to ascertain. However, it has been proven that Madiun, the third largest city in Indonesia, has not fallen. Indonesian resistance leaders called for a scorched earth policy on Madiun radio last night.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] According to the announcement on the 22nd, after Dutch paratroopers captured Yogyakarta, the capital of Indonesia, on the 19th, Dutch armored columns also entered Yogyakarta and joined forces with the paratroopers. Other Dutch troops occupied Solo (the largest city in the Republic of Indonesia) and the major oil refining center of Cepu in northeastern Java. The Dutch headquarters in Semarang announced that Dutch armored columns entered Yogyakarta at 8:00 PM on the 21st and took over the city from the paratroopers. The paratroopers said that their sudden descent from the sky on the 19th was "completely unexpected by the defending forces," and there were still unfinished letters on typewriters in several Indonesian offices. It was also said that the Republican army had withdrawn into the nearby mountains.</p>
<h3>Seven Mediators Safely Fly Back to Batavia</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd, Broadcast from Batavia: The seven members of the United Nations Mediation Committee who were trapped in Kaliurang have flown back to Batavia. All personnel are safe and sound. It is said that they only knew the Dutch army was attacking when the bombs started falling. Belgian representative Herremans said that he went to Kaliurang Airport on Sunday morning to meet the United Nations plane and saw the plane appearing in the sky and starting to drop bombs. According to American Lisle, "We were awakened by a loud explosion on Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon, the Republican troops left Kaliurang and retreated into the nearby mountains."</p>
<h3>Dulles Returns Home from Paris and Talks About Improved U.S.-Soviet Relations; Disputes Between the Two Sides Will Not Lead to War</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] Dulles, who has just returned from the UN General Assembly in Paris, believes that the prospects for peace in the United Nations have improved in the past year. Dulles led the US delegation in the latter half of the Paris UN General Assembly talks. The above opinion was expressed at a press conference after he returned to New York by ship from Europe on Monday.</p>
<p>Dulles said, "About a year ago at this time, I had just returned from the London Foreign Ministers Conference. The failure of that conference was the cause of the gloomy atmosphere and predictions of a possible war. We have experienced a year full of tense events, but we have not experienced war. On the contrary, I believe that some progress has been made in laying the foundation for peace. The most fruitful thing in the past year has been the work of the Paris UN General Assembly meeting in the past three months. There are still many dangers and difficulties in the future, but I believe that a constructive foundation has been laid at the Paris meeting, and the remaining difficulties can be overcome by peaceful means." A reporter asked what the above-mentioned foundation refers to, apart from words and resolutions. Dulles replied, "I do not underestimate words and resolutions, because they often lead to coordinated action. I do not believe that any agreement can be reached with the Soviet Union soon, but failure to reach an agreement does not necessarily lead to war. Countries that believe in a free society have shown encouraging solidarity. International understanding is obtained from conferences like the Paris UN General Assembly. The basic views of communist leaders are so different from those of the United States and Western countries that I do not expect an agreement to be reached quickly. However, disagreement should not be expressed in a violent way, and violent methods are currently being used in Berlin, Greece, Korea, and other places."</p>
<h3>Indonesia's Neighboring Countries Will Form an International Legion to Jointly Resist the Dutch Government; Indonesian Envoy to the U.S. Announces in the U.S.</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 21st] Indonesian Republic Plenipotentiary Minister to the United States, Soemitro, announced to reporters that the Netherlands, under the pretext of restoring law and order, is actually causing unrest within its territory. Soemitro stated that the Republican government now only has exile as a last resort, and may go to Sumatra to direct the war. When asked by reporters whether the Indonesian Republican government would form an alliance with the Communist Party to resist the Dutch army, Soemitro refused to comment on the position on this issue, only saying that the Republican government had suppressed the Communist Party's uprising two months ago. Soemitro expressed doubt that the Security Council would be able to stop the Dutch aggression, and emphasized that the key to the overall situation lies in Washington. Soemitro believed that Indonesia's neighboring countries may organize an international legion to resist the Dutch army, and hinted that the future relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands would be greatly affected by this incident. Finally, he said, "I firmly believe that the Republic will be able to struggle out of the struggle and become a sovereign and independent country."</p>
<h3>Seven War Criminals Including Tojo Were Executed by Hanging This Morning; Executed Secretly in Sugamo Prison</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 23rd, Broadcast from: Tokyo, the seven war criminals including Tojo were executed in the execution ground in Sugamo Prison. MacArthur Headquarters issued a brief statement saying, "Seven war criminals sentenced to death by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East have been hanged between 0:00 and 0:35 on the morning of December 23, 1948." The original statement was only twenty-seven words, and the life of the imperialists who committed all kinds of evil deeds in the past came to an end. Japanese monk Hanshan once offered last prayers for the seven. According to Hanshan, they were hanged by an American executioner of unknown name. When they were at the height of their power, they did not pay attention to religion at all, but their attitude changed when they were about to die and they were in a "clear state of mind." When the execution was carried out, only a very small number of officers who had sworn to keep the secret were present to monitor it, and the guards in front of Sugamo Prison were extremely strict. This execution took very little time, so people here speculated that it must have been that four people were hanged simultaneously first, and then three people were hanged simultaneously. Reporters from various countries have repeatedly requested to be present to cover the news, but they were rejected. The seven people executed today are Hideki Tojo, Kenji Doihara (65 years old), Koki Hirota (70 years old), Seishiro Itagaki (63 years old), Kimura (59 years old), Iwane Matsui (70 years old), and Muto (56 years old).</p>
<h3>British Attitude Is Apathetic to the Dutch Invasion of Indonesia; Even Advocates for Dutch Victory over Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The British political circles are still reluctant to comment on the Indonesian incident today. The Foreign Office even refused to confirm or deny rumors that the British Ambassador to the Netherlands had advised the Dutch government not to take military action against the Republic of Indonesia last week. The British government felt quite torn on this issue because of its position in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Southeast Asia. Internally, it must obtain the support of the majority of Parliament to decide on actions against the Netherlands. On the other hand, for the sake of cooperation with the signatories of the Brussels Treaty, it must cooperate more closely with the Netherlands, especially to deal with the communist infiltration in Southeast Asia. India and Australia in the British Commonwealth are strongly opposed to the actions of the Netherlands. All major circles in Britain now hope that the Netherlands and the stable elements of the Republic will resume negotiations as soon as possible, and at the same time hope that the Dutch army can defeat the extremists who are not controlled by the leaders of the Republic.</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Can Fight for a Long Time Even Without U.S. Aid; Remarks by the Dutch Ambassador to the U.S. Kriffen</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kriffen visited Deputy Secretary of State Lovett this afternoon. After talking for an hour, he declared that his visit was to learn about the United States' position on the Indonesian incident, and he did not make any requests to the U.S. government. He also said that he had never heard that the U.S. government had issued a warning to the Dutch government. He also knew nothing about the Republic's application to the U.S. government to cancel economic aid to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan, and that this plan was specifically for economic recovery and did not include transporting war supplies. When asked by reporters whether the Netherlands could fight in Indonesia without the aid of the Marshall Plan, the Ambassador replied: The Netherlands can definitely use its own resources to wage a long-term war.</p>
<h3>Stalin's Sixty-Ninth Birthday; No Celebrations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 21st] Today is Stalin's sixty-ninth birthday. According to recent reports, although Stalin's hair is gray, he is in very good health. The newspapers here did not mention Stalin's birthday, and there were no flags or celebrations. There were no ceremonies.</p>
<h3>Doihara and Itagaki Lamented Before Death; Will Emphasized Mutual Assistance Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] War criminals Doihara and Itagaki, who are now awaiting execution by hanging in Sugamo Prison, have recently written their wills. The titles of the two wills are "Last Words to China and Japan," which are probably addressed to the people of China and Japan. The will is now being kept by a Japanese monk. The Allied authorities have allowed the monk to offer religious prayers for them before the seven war criminals are executed. The monk followed the instructions of Doihara and Itagaki and will publish their wills after the two criminals die. It is reported that in their will, in addition to paying tribute to the Chinese people, the two criminals emphasized that China and Japan must support each other, otherwise the two countries will decline together.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The condition of Yoshijiro Umezu and Toshio Shiratori, who were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, deteriorated further on the 22nd. It is said that Umezu has reached a dying state.</p>

Representatives from the United States, Britain, and France held the first meeting after the Soviet Union's withdrawal today, but still left the door open for the Soviet Union to participate.</p>
<p>They said in a formal announcement, "If the Soviet authorities decide now or in the future to continue to maintain the original agreement between the four powers, the four-power control of Berlin can be restored. During the Soviet Union's absence, the Western Allies will exercise the functions of the Allied Joint Headquarters, although we understand that due to the Soviet Union's obstruction, the decisions of the Joint Headquarters can currently only be implemented in the Western District." Their first decision was to allocate coal so that the Western District of Berlin could have electricity for the whole day on one day during the Christmas holidays. This date will be decided by the German city government. According to the explanation of the Western countries, although the Soviet Union refused to attend, the Joint Headquarters was by no means defunct. With the resumption of regular meetings, the Western countries pointed out that they would be able to strengthen the administrative work of the Western District.</p>

<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's XT104 Sky Master aircraft, flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, crashed into a mountain on Pisha Island, about thirteen miles from Hong Kong, and burned down at approximately 2 p.m. the day before yesterday. The wreckage of the crashed plane was found that evening on the mountainside of Pisha Island. All 28 passengers and five crew members, including two stewardesses, were confirmed dead. All bodies were transported from the crash site to Kowloon yesterday afternoon for preparation. China National Aviation Corporation will send a special plane this morning to take the families of the deceased passengers to Hong Kong to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation released the list of deceased passengers yesterday, which included many well-known individuals. In addition to China National Aviation Corporation Vice President Quentin Roosevelt, former Central Propaganda Department Minister Peng Xuepei (also known as Peng Hao Xu), and National Assembly Representative and Director of the Central News Agency's Shanghai Branch, Feng Youzhen, there was famous film director Fang Peilin, Shanghai Municipal Senator Shao Yongsheng (who used the name Zhang Shou when purchasing the ticket), former Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Luo Liangjian, and famous socialites from Peking and Tientsin, Miss Zhu the Fourth and Miss Zhu the Ninth (also known as Wu Zhu Jinyun and Zhu Hongyun, daughters of General Zhu Jiqing). Peng Xuepei was invited by Feng Youzhen to Guangzhou to plan the publication of the Guangzhou edition of the Central Daily News. Feng had already purchased two tickets for a twin-engine aircraft to Guangzhou, but Peng, for safety reasons, insisted on taking the Sky Master aircraft, so he canceled the tickets to Guangzhou and booked seats to Hong Kong instead. Unexpectedly, he died in the crash, which is truly unfortunate. Municipal Senator Shao Yongsheng was commissioned by Jingfu Shirt and Socks Factory to go to Hong Kong to discuss business matters and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai three days later to participate in the current session of the Municipal Senate. Miss Zhu the Fourth's husband, Wu Jing, was a close friend of China National Aviation Corporation General Manager Liu Jingyi. The couple died together on the same plane. Miss Zhu the Ninth was the daughter-in-law of Northeastern warlord Wu Junsheng and, along with her sister, was well-known in Peking and Tientsin society.</p>
<p>Air Stewardess's Words Become Prophecy</p>
<p>The deceased stewardess Huang Sumei was 23 years old. Her father, Huang Hongjun, is the manager of ABC Underwear Company, and his family is wealthy. According to the China National Aviation Corporation flight crew, Huang was usually very enthusiastic about her work. Before this takeoff, the company sent a car to her home to pick her up to the airport. Huang chatted with the driver in the car, saying that she had been flying continuously recently and felt quite tired, but because she was interested in her work, she did not want to quit, and said, "I would be willing to die on the plane." Unexpectedly, her words became a prophecy. The other stewardess, Zhu Renxian, was 21 years old and the granddaughter of the late master of Chinese classical studies, Zhang Taiyan.</p>
<h3>Complete List of Deceased: 35 Passengers and Crew</h3>
<p>The complete list of passengers and crew is recorded as follows: Passengers: Wang Hujinyuan, Wang Wen, Zhao Guohua, Chen Yi (businessman), Han Mingyi, Luo Liangjian, Qu Bing, Qu Man, Fang Peilin, Quentin Roosevelt, Huang Shenfan, Xu Zhenquan, Wu Jing'an, Wu Zhu Jinyun, Wu Zhu Hongyun, Liao Dequan, Chen Dong Shufen, Rong Yiren, Feng Youzhen, Peng Hao Xu (also known as Peng Xuepei), Wang Muzong, Zhang Shou (also known as Shao Yongsheng), Chen Baiqiao, Xin Dafu, Yang Hailin, Lu Tao Wei Chen, Lu younger brother, Luo Xiaofen.</p>

<h3>Flying Low in Heavy Fog Led to Mountain Crash and Fire; Hong Kong Governor Cables British Government; Crashed Plane Disregarded Warnings</h3>
<p>The cause of the crash and the aftermath are being investigated by Gao Dajing, a director of China National Aviation Corporation, who was dispatched to Hong Kong yesterday by the company authorities. The Civil Aviation Administration has cabled its Guangzhou station to send personnel to Hong Kong to investigate all circumstances. However, according to a Reuters report from Hong Kong on the 22nd, Hong Kong Governor Grantham cabled the British Colonial Office on the 22nd, stating that the China National Aviation Corporation Sky Master aircraft "disregarded the warnings of the Hong Kong control tower and flew in heavy fog," leading to the crash and fire on Pisha Island. This seems credible, given another report from Hong Kong that the weather was bad on the 21st.</p>
<p>As for the rumor that the plane had been repaired before takeoff and that there might have been engine problems, aviation industry sources in Shanghai said that considering the plane was able to fly smoothly to Hong Kong and crashed suddenly when only a few minutes from the airport, it did not seem to be due to mechanical failure. General speculation is that the cause of the crash may have been a momentary oversight by the pilot. On the same day, China National Aviation Corporation flights 103 and 106, which departed for Hong Kong at the same time as flight 104, all arrived safely. The pilot of the crashed plane, Sunby, was an experienced aviator who had repeatedly flown over the Hump during the War of Resistance. However, it is known that he always liked to fly low. The mountain at the crash site is over 500 feet high, and it is possible that he crashed due to carelessness. Sampey had already been scheduled to leave China with his wife and children on the 29th of this month and this was his last roundtrip flight in China.</p>
<p>Bodies and Luggage Scattered Across the Mountainside</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 22nd] China National Aviation Corporation Sky Master XT-104, flying from Shanghai to Hong Kong, crashed and burned on the mountainside of Pisha Island. All 35 people on board died instantly. Fourteen charred bodies were found this morning lying on the mountaintop, and four were found in the ashes of the plane. One of these is thought to be Quentin Roosevelt. All are scheduled to be transported to Hong Kong on the 22nd. Twenty police officers and airline staff spent all morning on the 22nd collecting bodies, luggage, and other debris on the mountainside. The impact was very strong, and most of the passengers died instantly. The victims' remains and plane parts were scattered over an area of half a mile.</p>
<p>Passenger's Arm Severed, Watch Still Running</p>
<p>Two of the four engines were thrown 300 yards away, and no part of the plane was intact. Even the tail had been reduced to a pile of white ash. The watch on the arm of one passenger, which had been severed, was still running. According to pilots who inspected the scene today, the crashed plane was flying at approximately 100 miles per hour. It was flying too low, and its right wing struck a 554-foot-high rock on the edge of the island, causing it to immediately catch fire and burn.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Hong Kong, 22nd] Huo Shi Zhou (also known as Ju Sha Island), the crash site of the China National Aviation Corporation plane, is only six minutes from the airport and 500 feet high. The plane crashed into the mountainside. The passengers' remains were escorted back to Hong Kong by police in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Peng and Feng Die in Line of Duty While Flying South to Start Newspaper</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Peng Xuepei, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, former Minister of Propaganda, and Administrative Yuan Affairs Committee Member, and Feng Youzhen, president of the Shanghai Central Daily News, director of the Central News Agency's Shanghai branch, and National Assembly Representative, were traveling to Hong Kong and then Guangzhou on a China National Aviation Corporation Sky Master aircraft to prepare for the establishment of the Guangzhou Central Daily News. Unfortunately, they encountered an accident and died. When the tragic news arrived, people from all walks of life were deeply shocked and saddened. According to officials in charge of the Central Propaganda Department, after the Guangzhou Zhongshan Daily, Guangzhou Daily, South China Daily, and Heping Daily were merged and reorganized into the Guangdong Daily this spring, there was no directly affiliated party newspaper in Guangzhou, the birthplace of the National Revolution, while the Communist bandits' reactionary propaganda in Hong Kong and Macau was becoming increasingly rampant. In order to strengthen its propaganda power in South China, the department decided to allocate a portion of the Shanghai Central Daily News's equipment to Guangzhou to establish the Guangzhou Central Daily News and sent Feng to prepare for it. Feng invited Peng to be the chairman of the board of directors of the newspaper, as he was familiar with the situation in Guangdong. They were planning to work together when they unfortunately died in the same plane crash. Peng and Feng had devoted themselves to the National Revolution and the newspaper industry for decades, and their unexpected deaths are a great loss to the country and especially to the newspaper industry.</p>

During the review, the following may be consulted as necessary: (1) Registration forms of rice market arrivals and purchase and sales receipts. (2) Account books of the Rice Industry Association for the distribution of cotton cloth. (3) Relevant account books of rice shops, rice mills, or rice dealers. In addition, the Accountants Association may be requested to designate an accountant to assist in the process as necessary.</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed the idea of determining the percentage of random checks to be conducted by district. The review committee will collect retail account books and send them to the Police Bureau and Civil Affairs Bureau, which will forward them to the various sub-bureaus and district Baojia for on-site random checks.

Hu recognized that Zhang was a friend and knew that Zhang had died on the Jiangya, so he immediately suspected the checks. While the bank teller was examining them, Hu confidentially informed the teller, who in turn reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau, which sent officers to the bank to take Chen into custody. Chen stated that the checks belonged to Li Chen A'e, who lived on Linsen East Road. Li Chen A'e was then summoned and testified that her son, Li Sanli, had picked them up outside. Her son was then summoned and stated that he had found them in the clothing of a corpse from the Jiangya disaster at the Siming Gongsuo.</p>

<h3>Education Bureau Calls Representatives of Various Schools to Discuss Allocation of Supplies</h3>

<h3>Post Office Cracks Down on Solicitation of Year-End Tips; Hopes Public Will Pay Attention to Two Points</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] News from the Shanghai Postal Administration: As the Gregorian New Year is approaching, the bureau has received reports from the outside world that some people are extorting year-end tips in the name of post office messengers. After sending personnel to investigate in detail, it was discovered that there were indeed criminals extorting money. In order to prevent this, in addition to publishing announcements in various newspapers, the bureau is continuing to ask for public cooperation and has also written to the police bureau for assistance in strictly arresting these individuals. On the one hand, it is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention to two points: (1) If someone comes to solicit year-end tips while delivering letters, it can be proved that he is indeed a post office messenger. All sectors of society can secretly record the number worn on the messenger's collar or the messenger number on the envelope and immediately notify the post office. The bureau will deal with it severely and reward the informant a considerable reward in accordance with military regulations. (2) If someone is not wearing a number or is wearing plain clothes or is not the usual messenger delivering letters and comes to solicit year-end tips, it is clear that he is fraudulently extorting money in the name of the post office. It is hoped that he will be immediately turned over to the police bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Look at the Power of Gold! Crowds Flood Streets During Curfew; Running in the Rain, All Become Soaked Chickens; Military and Police Agencies Dispatch Large Numbers to Disperse, a Miserable Sight</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] This city's "gold rush" has reached a state of madness. Today is the day the Central Bank announced the distribution of the second batch of application forms. Starting yesterday evening, citizens vying to exchange for gold began to gather from all directions in the Bund area. At night, the bank and bureau doors handling gold deposit and exchange, such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Postal Remittance Bureau, and Central Cooperative Treasury, were already lined with dense and layered queues, and more and more people were arriving later. By the time the curfew began at 11 p.m., the areas near the Bund, Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, and Henan Road were simply packed with people. Pushing, shouting, and making a noise, it was a mess. There were all kinds of people among them, but most were commoners from the working class, and there were even many elderly and weak women who were crowded into the crowd. The piercing cold wind on the riverbank, and the small citizens, who estimated tens of thousands in numbers, were willing to stand and wait all night to gain the profit that one or two taels of gold could bring.</p>
<p>After learning of this situation, the security authorities, considering that it was a time of martial law, not only violating curfew laws but also hindering public safety, urgently dispatched a large number of security police and mounted patrol units from the police bureau to try to disperse the crowd. However, the crowd, obsessed with gold, was unwilling to disperse. The police on the mounted patrol units waved their whips and the security police put bayonets on their rifles. The crowd dispersed here and gathered there, clamoring and shouting, and were never willing to leave. The two sides were at a standstill for a long time, and the situation was very tense for a time. Afterwards, the police were reinforced, and the garrison command's military police also arrived. However, due to a lack of unified command and a clear dispersal plan, they first forced the crowd on the Bund away from the bank buildings and concentrated them along the river. Then they drove them north, then into Nanjing Road, and turned north to Sichuan Road, and then drove most of them north of Suzhou Creek. By this time, it was already past midnight. Then the mounted patrol units drove the crowd in the Jiujiang Road and Henan Road area west. Suddenly, a heavy rain poured down, and the poor crowd were all soaked chickens. In the escape, some women, children, and the elderly were trampled and injured. Their screams were unbearable to see. However, many people still took the opportunity to hide in the alleys along the road, and more rushed into the back door of the Central Bank to take refuge, hoping to continue to be the first to exchange gold after the curfew was lifted at dawn. As of 2 a.m., when this reporter finished writing, this countless crowd had still not been cleared, and it is expected that today's gold exchange line will intensify, and the chaos in order can be predicted. If the gold exchange methods are not improved, the consequences are truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>[Another report] Last night, the police arrested several scalpers in the gold exchange crowd and also discovered that the drivers of several private cars were deliberately parking their cars nearby, providing lodging for scalpers for a fee. All have been arrested and sent to the bureau for handling according to the law.</p>

The Lawyers Association's Public Legal Aid Association assigned twelve lawyers, including Qu Yue, to appear in court to defend them. The trial lasted from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. The court ordered that the verdict be announced on the 29th of this month. Because the defendants had been detained for a long time, all requested to be released on bail pending judgment. The court approved the bail application. Because it was late and there was no time to complete the bail procedures, the defendants were handed over to their respective defense lawyers and released in court. When the students left the court, they were deeply grateful for the Special Criminal Court's care for young people.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Transactions Plummet; Price Cuts and Distress Sales Still Find Few Buyers; Affects New House Construction Movement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to real estate industry insiders: Real estate transactions have fallen into a state of stagnation since the overall war situation reversed. Compared with the actual market price before August 19th, the most severe cases saw general real estate prices halved. Recently, due to repeated peace talks and a slightly stabilized situation, general real estate prices have begun to improve slightly, but they are still only 75% to 80% of their previous levels. It is reported that among the voices of sharp drops in real estate prices, the hardest hit are general real estate public bureaus. During the period when these companies were in management, they had already exchanged some of their holdings for gold bills, and they also replenished with more real estate. Although the business of various companies is currently weak, daily expenses still have to be maintained with difficulty. Therefore, even though real estate prices have fallen, they still have to sell at a loss, but there are very few buyers. Moreover, amidst the sharp drops in real estate prices, most of the new house construction movement in this city has fallen into a state of stagnation. This is because the cost of materials for building new houses is still high, and labor costs are particularly expensive compared to before. After completion, it is not easy to sell, and there are even cases of people occupying newly built houses without compensation, causing those who invest in building houses to hesitate.</p>
<h3>Footprint Research; Cracks the Longhua Murder Case; Three Suspects Arrested in Succession; Confess to the Reasons for the Murder</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the unidentified young man in military uniform found dead in a wheat field by a farmer in Tianyao Bridge, Longhua Town, on the 20th of this month, after investigation by officers of the Garrison Headquarters, the case was fully solved the afternoon before yesterday. Of the four murderers, one is still being pursued, while the remaining three have all been arrested and are being interrogated.</p>
<p>The deceased was identified as Fang 堃, a second lieutenant platoon leader of the 5th Company, 634th Regiment, 226th Brigade. Upon hearing the news, He Longqing, Chief of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, immediately ordered Xia Lian, the Captain of the First Brigade of the Garrison卫, to investigate and arrest the murderers. Yan Jinwen, the Captain of the Third Company of the Brigade, upon receiving the order, immediately went to the address to investigate with relevant personnel. After examining the body, they discovered very clear strangulation marks on the deceased's neck and several rubber-soled footprints near the corpse. Based on the above clues, the Captain and others immediately discovered that the rubber shoes worn by Deng Xingqiao, a sergeant platoon leader at the Shanghai Longhua Repair Factory of the Ordnance Bureau, 天鑰橋, were identical to the footprints at the scene. After determining that Deng Xingqiao was the murderer in this case, they arrested him. According to his confession: Guo Qiao, a repairman at the factory, and Lv Xingyi and Luo Shanlin, privates in the factory's security guard team, were also accomplices. However, when officers were dispatched to arrest them, the three suspects had already fled upon hearing the news. Chen Shize, the Captain of the guard team, seemed to bear some responsibility. When the Garrison Headquarters escorted the suspect to the scene of the incident for verification the afternoon before yesterday, they unexpectedly arrested Lv Xingyi and Guo Qiao, two of the above-mentioned three suspects, near 天鑰橋. According to the suspects' confessions, the reason for strangling Fang 堃 was that the deceased had stolen five taels and six m錢 of gold and a camera from them when they were in Qingdao. After they recently came to Shanghai, they demanded them back but were unsuccessful, so they strangled him. Currently, the Garrison Headquarters is continuing to interrogate the suspects rigorously in order to fully clarify the case. As for Luo Shanlin, who is still at large, a strict order is in place for his arrest.</p>
<h3>Body Discovered While Fishing in River</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 3:00 PM yesterday, in the 洗家河浜 river under the jurisdiction of the Maqiao Police Station of the Hudong New City Street Police Sub-bureau, a villager who was fishing in the river suddenly discovered a floating corpse. The upper body was naked, and the lower body was wearing old-fashioned Western-style pants. The hands were tied behind the back, and there were wounds on the head, neck, chest, and back. Afterwards, the Baojia office reported the incident to the Xinshijie Police Bureau. Sub-bureau Chief Wang Zhaoxin, along with Criminal Section Chief Liu Lianfang, led police officers to investigate. A piece of identification paper was found in the pants pocket, with the name Zhu A'san, 18 years old, from Qidong, a plasterer. The corpse was then sent to the 常德 Road morgue to await a post-mortem examination by the District Procuratorate. The case is clearly one of murder, and the sub-bureau has dispatched personnel to pursue the fleeing murderer.</p>

<h3>Defendants Sentenced for Extortion Under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Wang Linkang, Chen Ruyi, Pan Songlin, and others previously falsely reported to Jin Songzhong and Han Qiang, officers of the Garrison Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, that the Xiangyu Customs Brokerage on Shandong Road was hoarding cotton yarn and engaging in private gold speculation. They then conspired with another person, Zhu Fujian, to extort money. On the morning of July 3rd of this year, at 11:00 AM, they went to the customs brokerage together, using the name of the Garrison Brigade, to search under false pretenses. They threatened to bring the case to justice and extorted 2 billion 法幣, which they divided among themselves. On July 26th of the same month, Chen Ruyi, together with Xu Jie and Wang Ruixiang, who is at large, went to Wu Ziwen's residence on the third floor of No. 5 Pingwang Street, falsely claiming to be working at the Garrison Headquarters. They accused Wu of engaging in private gold speculation and extorted 3 billion 法幣. On August 4th, Chen again intended to use the same method to extort money from Zhu Daoxin, the owner of the Xinkang Tobacco Company on Hankou Road. He discussed it with Xu Jie, Wang Lin, Yu Xinfu, and others, and Xu and the other two carried out the extortion. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, they arranged to meet Zhu at the entrance of the Yangzi Hotel. Zhu reported the matter to the Garrison Headquarters, and they were apprehended. After confessing the previous events, they were sent to the District Court. Yesterday, Judge Ye Guiling announced the verdict: Chen Ruyi was found guilty of repeated extortion under false pretenses and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. Pan Songlin and Zhu Fujian were found guilty of jointly extorting money under false pretenses and each sentenced to six years of imprisonment. Wang Linkang was found guilty of helping others extort money under false pretenses and sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The 5 billion 法幣 obtained through extortion should be returned to the victims separately.</p>
<h3>Patrol Officer Sentenced to Five Years in Bribery Case; Yan Xuezeng</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Judge Fang Xianghai of the District Court announced the verdict yesterday in the corruption case of Yan Xuezeng and others, patrol officers of the Hongkou Police Sub-bureau: Yan Xuezeng was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for accepting bribes and engaging in behavior contrary to his duty, and parts of the case against Wei Ping and Ling Yunxiao were dismissed. When Yan was on duty from 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM on November 1st of this year, he went to inspect the various posts. When he arrived at the third patrol post on Sichuan Road, police officer Lou Rui reported that at 4:00 AM that morning, there was a matter of loading iron goods at the wharf near Jiangxi North Road on Suzhou North Road. He and another police officer, You Fengchi, intended to go to investigate, but Yan prevented them. Yan went alone and returned more than half an hour later, claiming that they were transporting stolen goods and that he had released them, and gave Lou a bribe of ten yuan and You twenty yuan. Then, Yan went to other patrol posts and, because the stolen goods he had released were being transported in rubber-wheeled vehicles and had to pass through various places, he gave police officer Wei Ping of the fourteenth post twenty yuan and patrol inspector Ling Yunxiao thirty yuan. The next day, Lou and You submitted the赃款 along with a report to the Hongkou Sub-bureau for review. After reporting to the General Bureau, it was determined that Yan, Wei, Ling, and the other three all had corrupt behavior, and they were transferred to the District Court for investigation, and the judgment was made as above.</p>

<h3>Christmas Scenes in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Christmas, originally a memorial holiday for Christians and Catholics, was initially only celebrated in Europe and the West. Later, as the number of Christians and Catholics increased, Christmas became increasingly popular and has almost become a global holiday. Every year on Christmas Eve, people around the world celebrate, give Christmas gifts, send Christmas cards, and spend Christmas Eve happily, and the enthusiasm is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The British almost regard Christmas as a "reunion festival." The whole family sits around a table and has dinner together. Even those who are far away from home and unable to return, their families will definitely pray and bless them at the dinner table. "Christmas pudding" is also a dessert that every Briton must eat that night.</p>
<p>Also, because the British have always been the most particular about etiquette, they are very enthusiastic about giving gifts and sending greeting cards on Christmas. In 1935 alone, more than 200,000 Christmas telegrams were sent in London alone. The number is truly staggering when calculated nationwide.</p>
<p>The British royal family, on every Christmas holiday, always allocates funds to relieve the poor in the slums. Churches everywhere also raise funds to entertain the poor and celebrate Christmas. British children even auction off their toys and donate the proceeds to churches to carry out welfare activities for the poor. On Christmas Day, the compassion of mankind can be said to be fully demonstrated in Britain.</p>
<p>The American people love to enjoy themselves, and Christmas is one of their "carnivals."</p>
<p>Nightclubs everywhere are open all night and are always crowded. Overnight, the city of New York alone consumes about 100,000 barrels of alcohol. Broadway Street was already a prosperous street, and on Christmas night, it is even known as "Liquor Street."</p>
<p>Poland is also a Christian country, but it has a unique ceremony. On Christmas Eve, every family holds a banquet, which is not a family reunion, but actually has a deep and solemn religious meaning.</p>
<p>Every family prepares all the dinner utensils, but cannot start eating until the first star appears in the sky. Therefore, the Polish Christmas dinner is called "Star Meal" or "Evening Watch Dinner."</p>
<p>The dining room is brightly lit with candles. Because they commemorate that the Savior Jesus was born in a manger, they put some grass on the table, cover it with white cloth, and then the whole family sits down. The head of the family picks up a plate containing a large cake, blesses it, and says a short speech, the general meaning of which is that everyone present should be at peace with God and all people. Then, the cake is cut open, and everyone present, including the servants, gets a share. After the cake is divided, everyone eats a little of their own share, and the rest is exchanged with each other to show mutual love.</p>
<p>Then, they bless each other, sing the Christmas song of 彼蘭, and start dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner, the children are led to another room, and an old man comes in, called the "Starlight Old Man." He asks and answers questions with the children one by one. If the child answers incorrectly, he will be reprimanded by the old man. Finally, he gives the prizes brought from the "Star Realm" to the children who answer correctly and have good behavior.</p>
<p>Bethlehem, the holy land where Jesus Christ was born, has a special meaning to spend Christmas there. Believers from nearby areas specially rush to the holy city to spend Christmas, and people from afar often take the opportunity of Christmas to visit the relics of the Savior's birth. Although the stable and manger are gone, the longing will never diminish. Therefore, in Bethlehem, many people from other places arrive a few days before Christmas. People from Europe, such as British and French, people from Eastern Europe, such as 彼蘭 and Hungarians, Egyptians from East Africa, Indians from the East, as well as Turks and Arabs from nearby, and Jews from all over the world, all come to visit the holy land in various forms, as if opening a human race exhibition.</p>
<p>In Bethlehem, you cannot see silvery white snow during Christmas. The streets are paved with white marble, which looks a bit like a silver world from a distance, appearing solemn and serene. On Christmas Eve, the large and small churches are packed full, and although there are many people, there is no noisy sound. The women wear black veils, as if preventing them from talking and laughing. This Mass lasts almost until dawn the next day.</p>
<p>The church building has a small basement that looks dark when you look down. Going down a small ladder and winding around a few turns, you reach this basement. There are fifty-three bright silver lamps lit there, shining very brightly. It symbolizes the manger in which Jesus slept when he was born, and contains the statues of Jesus and the crucifix. When the Mass is about to end, everyone lines up and goes down the small ladder in order, reading the story of Jesus's birth, written in Latin and engraved on a copper plaque.</p>
<h3>SAM’Ｘ</h3>
<p>Christmas, in English, is written as Christmas. The meaning of Christ is Christ, and mas is the explanation of birth. Now, many people write X'mas, using X to represent Christ. What exactly is going on?</p>
<p>Regarding X'mas, there are two explanations. One says that the pronunciation of X is similar to Christ, and it is much simpler to write. Another says that the shape of X is somewhat like a cross, which can be used as a symbol of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In fact, both explanations are incorrect. The origin of that X is rooted in Greek. In Greek, X is equivalent to Ch in English; Christ is written as Xriitos, and the abbreviation is Xt. In the sixteenth century, the scope of circulation of Greek became increasingly narrow, but in the minds of many people, they thought it was a glory to understand Greek, and Xt was still often used. By extension, Christian was also written as Xtian, and Christmas was also written as X'mas. This habit has continued to this day.</p>
<h3>Reflecting on the Winter Solstice</h3>
<p>The Western Christmas holiday is commonly referred to as the foreign Winter Solstice, and all countries hold enthusiastic celebrations. However, the Chinese Winter Solstice is also valued by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>According to custom, on the day before the Winter Solstice, relatives and friends give each other food as gifts, with baskets and boxes filling the streets, which is commonly called the Winter Solstice Plate. The day before the festival is commonly called Winter Solstice Eve, and on this evening, every household hosts a banquet, which is called Festival Wine. Daughters who have married and returned to their parents' home must rush back to their husband's family that evening. Whether rich or poor, people will definitely buy food to offer to the local earth god, and some even hang portraits of ancestors. The rituals are more elaborate than on ordinary holidays, hence the saying "The Winter Solstice is as important as the New Year." The customs of Wu County place great emphasis on the Winter Solstice, so there is also the saying "Fat Winter, Lean New Year."</p>
<p>Chinese farmers believe that they can predict the sunny and rainy weather of the new year from the warm, humid, and ripe weather of the night before the Winter Solstice. There is a saying: "If it is wet before the Winter Solstice, there will be five winds, and peace and happiness until the Grain in Ear." It is commonly believed that if it rains or snows around the Winter Solstice, the New Year's Eve will be sunny; if the Winter Solstice is sunny, the New Year's Eve will be rainy or snowy. Therefore, it is also said: "A clean Winter Solstice, a wet New Year's Eve."</p>
<p>This year's Chinese Winter Solstice falls two days before Christmas. The Chinese Winter Solstice and the foreign Winter Solstice are coming together. After finishing the Winter Solstice Eve dinner and completing the grand Winter Solstice Warm House ceremony, in two days, it will be time for the annual Christmas Carnival.</p>

<h3>Snippets of Christmas: Santa Claus Flies an Airplane</h3>
<p>Along the eastern coast of the United States, every Christmas, an airplane always flies through the sky. For poor families, the airplane drops packages tied to parachutes. Inside the packages are pastries, candies, cigarettes, books, and clothes. When people below hear the rattling sound of the airplane, they run out to greet it. In the 20th-century scientific world, this airplane is commissioned by a large merchant in Boston to distribute Christmas gifts once a year.</p>
<h3>Free Shopping</h3>
<p>In Dallas City, there is a shrewd and calm old Jewish man who owns a department store called Luther. This Jewish owner is not a stingy person and is very considerate of the poor. Every Christmas, poor people can go to his store to pick out a few daily necessities without paying a penny. This practice has been going on for thirty years, and more than ten thousand people come to collect things every year. On Christmas Day, Luther's store is packed from morning to night, and the staff cannot keep up. People from other stores also come to volunteer their services.</p>
<h3>Three Christmas Islands</h3>
<p>There are three islands in the world named "Christmas." One is in the Indian Ocean, two hundred miles south of Java, and was discovered in 1643 by a British merchant ship, the Mary, due to a storm. The second is in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, a solitary coral island discovered by Captain Cook in 1777. Both islands were discovered on Christmas Day, hence the name "Christmas Island." There is also a "Christmas Island" on the French coast of the Atlantic Ocean, near Île de Ré. The history of that island is untraceable, but it is speculated that it was also discovered on Christmas Day.</p>
<h3>Christmas Superstitions</h3>
<p>If the moon is bright and the stars are sparse on Christmas Eve, there will be a great harvest of melons and fruits next year. If dark clouds cover the moon or it rains heavily, there will be no melons or fruits to eat and no wine to drink next year. If it snows on Christmas, there will be a bumper harvest of crops next year. If it is dark, milk production will be abundant. If there is a strong wind on Christmas dawn, livestock will suffer. If there is thunder and lightning on Christmas, the husband will be unusually cold.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, the first thing that enters the house should be blue. If a man comes in, he will bring happiness. Even for animals, males are better than females. If Christmas falls on a Wednesday, it is a very bad omen. Next year there will be war, epidemics, volcanic eruptions, natural disasters, and man-made calamities one after another.</p>
<h3>Christmas Tree</h3>
<p>The creator of the Christmas tree was named Saint Lorentz, an old man from the Hesselach Forest in Alsace, Germany. He loved children, and children loved him. Two days before Christmas, he wanted to hold a children's party to celebrate Christmas. But he was very poor and could not afford to buy toys.</p>
<p>The day before, it snowed heavily, and the weather was still cold that day, but the sun was very bright. Saint Lorentz woke up in the morning and took a walk in the forest. He accidentally saw a small fir tree covered with white snow, with long and short icicles hanging on its branches. The sunlight reflected off of it, making it extremely beautiful. The old man had a flash of inspiration, dug up the tree, planted it in a pot, and hung it full of fruits, honey, and cross-shaped biscuits made of flour, as well as many small candles.</p>
<p>On Christmas night, he rang a small bell, and the children came. Seeing the tree with its colorful lights and shining candles, they were very happy. So they sang, danced, and caroused until midnight before dispersing contentedly. From then on, every Christmas, families prepared a small fir tree, called a Christmas tree.</p>
<p>In the national park in California, USA, there is a very tall pine tree, the height of which is equivalent to a twenty-story building, and the trunk is seven or eight arm spans thick. In 1925, the United States designated this tall pine tree as the national Christmas tree of the United States. This is considered the largest Christmas tree in the world. Since then, every Christmas, many people come to this Christmas tree to hold Christmas ceremonies, singing Christmas carols on a mountain of crystal clear world.</p>
<p>In Altadena, southern California, there is also a very famous row of Christmas trees, which are neat and beautiful pines and cypresses, stretching for a mile. As early as 1882, a traveler named Walter Raymond traveled to India and climbed the Himalayas, the roof of the world. He found many beautiful pines and cypresses there, which were extremely moving. So he brought the seeds home and planted them himself. Later, his two sons carefully cultivated them, transplanting them one by one, covering the entire garden. This is the famous Christmas tree. Now Walter Raymond has passed away, and the garden is desolate, leaving only this row of pines and cypresses for future generations to admire.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Approves Methods for Using Cash Capital Deposited During Capital Increases by Native Banks</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of using cash capital deposited during capital increases by native banks, the Shanghai Native Banks, Money Shops, and Trust Companies Association had previously requested the Monetary Authority to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is now known that the use of this cash capital has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Any native bank that undertakes loans for agricultural, industrial, mining production, or public transportation projects, or other legitimate purposes, may apply to the Ministry for approval to use the funds on a case-by-case basis. Native banks that undertake mortgage loans that comply with the provisions of the Banking Law, with a term of more than one month, may also apply to use the funds, and the Central Bank has been authorized to approve the use of the deposited funds. The above provisions have been communicated to all members by the Native Banks, Money Shops, and Trust Companies Association.</p>
<h3>Easy Credit, Strong Buying Interest: Rice Prices Continue to Rise, Grain Transactions Increase, Oil Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Rice arrivals yesterday were still abundant, but prices in the producing areas were firmer. With easy credit and ample funds, buying interest increased, and market prices rose. In the southern market, high-quality white rice was 350 yuan, up 10 yuan; thin rice was 350 yuan, up 5 yuan; early rice sales were relatively smooth, rising to 345 yuan, up 15 yuan; and Yangxian rice was 345 yuan, with a flat market. Other varieties such as Ziyuan, Yinyuan, and Xian rice all showed slight increases of 5 to 10 yuan. In the northern market, white rice and Yangxian rice were both 355 yuan, each up 25 yuan. Other grades also reported increases of 10 to 20 yuan. Total arrivals in the two markets yesterday were 15,197.5 shi, including 7,974.5 shi in the southern market and 7,223 shi in the northern market.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The market sentiment remained firm, and transactions were brisk. Old brand flour, which had risen too high as of yesterday, remained at 147 yuan. Army ship flour also opened at the original price of 139 yuan, with brisk transactions. Other miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 6-7 yuan.</p>
<p>Bran showed a slight increase, with Fuxin large bag at 81 yuan and Zaofeng large bag at 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Due to reduced arrivals, transactions increased, and market prices rose across the board. Soybeans rose by more than 10 yuan, with Hankou Zhadou at 190 yuan. Red sorghum also showed an increase of 15 yuan. Corn rose slightly by 5 yuan, with Huangdu corn at 167 yuan. Sesame remained stable due to unchanged foreign packaging, with Hankou white sesame at 340 yuan.</p>
<p>Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Prices were firm at first but then declined, with a large difference between opening and closing prices. The market opening was good, and credit was easy, so the opening price of local factory soybean oil was high at 1,080 yuan, with many transactions. However, the market subsequently declined sharply to 1,030 yuan. Qingdao Jiangbei Jitong raw oil opened at 1,150 yuan, and the closing price fell back by 50 yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 1,020 yuan and remained stable at 1,000 yuan, also rising by 10 yuan. Jitong small cart sesame oil opened at 1,020 yuan and closed back at 960 yuan, showing a slight increase of 10 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil was 780 yuan, also showing an increase of 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Insurance Premiums Now Collected in Cash</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Insurance Trade Association, through a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, resolved that, starting from the 22nd, all premiums should be paid in cash on the same day. In the past, there had been cases where premiums were delayed for two or three months, causing significant losses to the industry. It is said that the change to cash payment is intended to help alleviate the situation.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Rates Rose Again Yesterday, Foreign Exchange Certificates Initially Firm but Then Weakened</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's overseas remittance rates rose again by 4 yuan yesterday, reaching 64 yuan. Foreign exchange transfer certificates were initially firm but then weakened. The opening price was 56 yuan, with insufficient supply to meet demand. Subsequently, due to purchases by various parties, the price rose further to 59 yuan. As exporters took advantage of the high price to sell, the price began to fall back, with the final buying price at 57 yuan and the selling price at 57 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 1 yuan and 7.5 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>In addition, credit tightened slightly yesterday, with interbank lending rates at 12 to 15 yuan per thousand yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 3.6 to 4.5 jiao. Cash remained abundant. Furthermore, because the market's black market interest rates were much higher than the 15 yuan per thousand yuan daily interest rate charged by money shops and similar businesses, banks had previously charged a handling fee. Now, because market interest rates have fallen and are even lower than the interest rates charged by similar businesses, all banks will temporarily stop charging the handling fee starting immediately.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate of Taiwan Dollar to Gold Yuan Officially Set at 350 to 1</h3>

<h3>National Bank Discount and Loan Association Passes 35 Acquisition Cases</h3>

<h3>To Encourage Export Business, Packing Loans Will Be Restored</h3>
<p>According to sources in the import and export industry, export packing loans, which have been suspended for a long time, will soon be restored. The Central Bank is preparing to start lending again, as the authorities have recognized that the export industry has been declining recently, and there is little demand for export transfer certificates. Even the items with the highest exports in normal times, such as bristles, tung oil, and casings, have now decreased to one-tenth of their previous levels. If this continues, the export industry will come to a standstill. In order to revitalize exports, packing loans will be restored to provide encouragement. However, according to the export industry, the recent decline in Shanghai exports is actually due to traffic congestion. Export goods purchased from the producing areas cannot be transported to Shanghai, so even if export loans are restored, the outlook for export business is still not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Import and Export Control Commission Completed, New Organization Established on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Shanghai Office Established to Manage Import and Export Business</p>
<p>The streamlined reorganization of the Import and Export Control Commission will be fully completed by the end of this month. All dismissed personnel have been issued severance pay and dismissed. The newly reorganized Import and Export Control Commission will be officially established on New Year's Day of the 38th year. The former director of the Export Promotion Department of the Commission, Chen Junren, will succeed as the director, and will continue to work in Shanghai, responsible for all administrative matters. In addition, the Import and Export Control Commission Shanghai Office will be established, specifically responsible for managing import and export control business in Shanghai, and for signing and approving import permits. The candidate for the director of the office has also been internally decided and will be announced soon. This office will also be established on January 1st.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the director of the Secretariat of the Commission, Fang Xian, the director of the Quota Allocation Department, Shen Zou Ting, and other directors and deputy directors are reportedly resigning.</p>
<h3>National Bank's Tianjin Region Expands to North China Region</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank's Tianjin Region Branch has now been renamed the North China Region Branch. The Shandong Province area, originally under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Region Branch, will be included in the North China Region Branch's jurisdiction. The former director of the Tianjin Region Branch, Zheng Daoru, has now been reassigned as the director of the North China Region Branch.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the weather was not good, the domestic and export tea markets were still favored by buyers, so the process was like a fish in water. In terms of prices, holders continued to hoard and sell at high prices, and the upward trend continued to spread. According to industry insiders, recently, the markets in Africa, Morocco, and other places have shown a renewed interest in various low-grade flower types such as Zhenmei and Xiumei teas. Unfortunately, the market inventory is dwindling, so transactions may not be as smooth as desired, but the market sentiment will continue to soar.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Remains Buoyant</h3>
<p>The sugar market continued to be firm and buoyant yesterday. Non-industry funds poured in, and the sugar company reduced its allocations, which immediately improved market sentiment. Moreover, as the end of the year and the holidays approached, demand from various places continued to increase, and the local market was particularly smooth, with the trend continuing to be good. No. 45 white refined sugar opened at 560 yuan in the morning. After opening, the buying interest was strong, and supply suddenly became scarce. Prices were pushed up across the board, with bids reaching a peak of 590 yuan at one point. The market sentiment softened slightly at the close, and buying interest weakened, with the market falling back by 10 yuan, but still up 30 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar was 545 yuan, also up 45 yuan. Other varieties such as Xingbai and red sugar also rose by about 15%.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Exports Decline Daily</h3>
<p>Local Sales in This City Only 20,000 Cases Per Month</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the cigarette industry, the main reason for the sluggish cigarette market prices is the lack of actual sales. Normal sales routes are: 1. North China, about 30,000 cases; 2. Northwest, more than 10,000 cases; 3. Yangtze River basin and Jinpu Railway, more than 30,000 cases; 4. Huhang Railway and Zhejiang-Fujian, more than 10,000 cases; 5. South China, more than 10,000 cases; local sales in this city are 20,000 cases. Currently, sales to North China have been cut off, and Guangdong is facing dumping of foreign cigarettes, with prices lower than those in Shanghai. The Northwest cannot be transported to, the Yangtze River lacks ships, the Jinpu Railway area is unstable, and sales in Zhejiang and Fujian are also poor. The only reliable market is this city, with just over 20,000 cases per month, but even this is affected by the release of hoarded goods, so demand is not high. General cigarette wholesalers and retailers, due to high interest rates, only seek to quickly sell off their stock and are unwilling to buy more goods and suffer losses, so the cigarette market cannot rise.</p>
<h3>Fine Yarn Rises Across the Board, Cotton Cloth Initially Rises but Then Flattens</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn prices rose and fell inconsistently. Sales to other places remained sluggish, and local demand was also not high. As a result, fine yarn rose across the board, while coarse yarn had mixed fortunes.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Diamond was quoted as high as 19,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan at the close, finally rising by 1,000 yuan. Other brands such as Baoguang and Jincheng also trended higher. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose slightly by 100 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 16,000 yuan, fell to a low of 15,700 yuan, and finally closed at 15,800 yuan, falling by 400 yuan.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 16,500 yuan, fell to a low of 15,000 yuan, and then slowly recovered to 15,700 yuan at the close, finally falling by 300 yuan. The price for warehouse receipts and next-day delivery was also down 300 yuan each. 20-count Double Horse fell by 400 yuan to close at 13,800 yuan. In addition, Golden Rooster and Tiannv also showed weakness. Prices for grades of 16-count and below were slightly up.</p>
<p>The cloth market rose and then fell back. The leading fine cloth initially opened at a new high of 570 yuan, so buying interest was strong, and prices were quoted higher at one point. However, negative news spread frequently near noon, and market sentiment weakened, leading to a sudden selling trend. Quoted prices gradually fell, and the market finally closed at a low of 540 yuan, resulting in an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous noon closing, but a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the aftermarket quoted prices. After the close, the bulls continued to cut their positions, and it was heard that some people were still selling at 530 yuan.</p>
<p>Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji opened at 570 yuan, reached a new high of 580 yuan, and then fell to 525 yuan half an hour before the close, closing at 530 yuan, finally rising by 10 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance and Leifeng Pagoda Biji each rose by about 200 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight opened at 565 yuan, fell to a low of 545 yuan, and closed at 550 yuan, finally rising by 18 yuan. Although the prices of other cloths were higher than the previous close, the underlying market was very weak.</p>
<p>China Textile Sales</p>
<p>China Textile sold 172 pieces of yarn yesterday, totaling 3,647,600 Gold Yuan. The approved prices were: 20-count Longevity Picture (excluding tax) 9,600 yuan, 14-count Water Moon 8,600 yuan, 15-count Water Moon 9,000 yuan, 32-count Double Strand Harvest 18,800 yuan, 40-count TK Sunlight 24,800 yuan, 42-count Double Strand Red Steed 18,500 yuan, 40-count Triple Strand Red Baoguang 19,400 yuan, 60-count Sunlight 24,800 yuan, and 60-count Double Strand Sunlight 27,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Stable, Silk Fabric Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The raw silk market yesterday initially rose and then fell, with the trend fluctuating in the middle. Market sentiment seemed soft, and the closing price showed a slight decline. 120-count Tianqiao opened at a high of 17,000 yuan. After opening, actual sales were stagnant, buyers watched from the sidelines, and individual sellers were eager to sell, so the market sentiment slightly weakened, and quoted prices gradually declined, reaching a low of 16,200 yuan. Subsequently, due to speculative buying, the market rebounded slightly, and the result was 16,600 yuan, up slightly by 100 yuan. Dongyang Jin San Ma and Siniyasishi, etc., generally showed no gains or losses.</p>
<p>The raw silk market trended sideways. The market price of foreign exchange certificates fluctuated very little, and market sentiment was not stimulated in any way. Export goods were not traded much yesterday, and the market showed no ups or downs. Domestic sales remained weak, sales were sluggish, and transactions were not active. However, due to the support of the holders, quoted prices were stable, and there was no strength to rise, so the trend was stable. D-grade 78 evenness opened at 19,000 yuan, and premium-grade in small lots was 18,500 yuan. Later, it was heard that yarn and cloth prices had initially risen and then fallen back, and silk mills were not buying much, so the market fell back by 1,000 yuan. The closing price was slightly higher than the previous day's noon closing by several hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The silk fabric market fluctuated greatly yesterday. Market sentiment was initially flat but then firm, and quoted prices were initially high but then softened. Meiya bedspreads initially traded at 11,200 yuan. After the quote, buying interest remained strong, and speculators scrambled to buy, so quoted prices rose steadily, reaching a new peak of 12,500 yuan. Finally, various parties took advantage of the high price to sell, and individual sellers took profits, so the price fell back. The market closed at 12,300 yuan, up 1,500 yuan. Dachen Bizhou, Siwei Ni, and Dawei Ni all rose by about 3.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Organizes Defense Force: Six Units Provisionally Set at Six Thousand Men</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zi Jian for This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from Hong Kong, 18th by Airmail] Following Governor Grantham's stern warning speech to the communists, he delivered another important statement in the Hong Kong Legislative Council on the 15th during discussions on the "Hong Kong Defense Force Bill," explaining the necessity of organizing the Hong Kong Defense Force. As a result, the term "Hong Kong Defense Force" immediately became a topic of conversation among the citizens.</p>
<p>This is truly "not a unique occurrence," and it could also be said to be "birds of a feather"—both Hong Kong and Shanghai are simultaneously proceeding with the organization of a civilian self-defense force. Due to the needs of the times, public opinion in both Hong Kong and mainland China has praised this as an "enlightened measure." According to the Governor's announcement, the organization of the Hong Kong Defense Force will be divided into six units: (1) Navy, (2) Army, (3) Air Force, (4) Auxiliary Services, (5) Women's Services, and (6) Headquarters. The organization is flexible and will depend on the needs of the environment. It is expected that six thousand people can be recruited in the fiscal year 1949 to 1950. In other words, in the initial plan, the strength of the Hong Kong Defense Force is provisionally set at six thousand, with a total budget of approximately six to seven million Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>The Governor pointed out, "To provide citizens with the opportunity to dedicate themselves to service in wartime or in times of emergency, people of all nationalities may participate. The wording of the oath of enlistment will not infringe upon the original nationality status of non-British subjects, and the headquarters will even have translators. It is evident that the main force of the defense force will be our overseas Chinese compatriots, and even those who do not understand English will not be hindered." This is much more open than the pre-war Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, which was limited to British subjects. Before the war, the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps had about nine hundred army personnel and about four hundred navy personnel. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the establishment was expanded, and the number of personnel increased to three thousand.</p>
<p>In an editorial on "Hong Kong Security" published on the 13th of this month, the Hong Kong English-language South China Morning Post pointed out that the Hong Kong government's evasion of responsibility for men and women who served silently in the past has had an adverse impact on public morale. Therefore, the Governor's statement clearly stated that members participating in military operations will be paid according to the salary scale of the British regular army, plus a local cost-of-living allowance. It also stated that those who join the navy, army, or air force may be transferred to serve outside of Hong Kong when necessary, but army personnel who do not wish to leave Hong Kong may declare this upon enlistment. It also said: "Men and women who participate in the Defense Force will sacrifice most of their time, or even their lives, to defend Hong Kong, The slowest. Everyone is issued a ration card that entitles them to purchase a fixed amount of food, including butter, meat, sugar, milk, and so on. In my opinion, they are using 'potatoes' as a substitute for the noodles of northern China and the rice of southern China. Ordinary people have three meals a day, as well as three or four tea breaks, around 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., and perhaps some people even have a 'tea' at 10:00 p.m. and before getting up in the morning. These 'teas' sometimes involve eating snacks. Usually, Saturdays and Sundays afternoons are cold meals. Most working people eat lunch in restaurants. There are several types of restaurants, with varying prices. Ordinary people usually spend about two shillings and three pence per meal.</p>
<p>Housing</p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the material living standards that is much higher than that of China. A family may have a small house, or a "flat" that forms a single unit. (The word "flat" is not easy to translate into Chinese. In reality, the so-called "flat" includes a living room, bedroom, kitchen, toilet, etc.) Before the war, there was a buy-a-house-on-installment plan. The government also built various houses for rent at cost. If we take "housing" as a standard, we cannot compare with England. An ordinary worker lives in a place that even a professor who has been muddling along in China for one or two decades may not have such "good fortune." The biggest reason, I think, is because Britain has a long-term stable situation. Although it has gone through two world wars, no enemy has ever landed on the British Isles.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>In this regard, I see that most people rely on trains, buses, and subways. The transportation network in this country is naturally very developed. Private cars do not seem to be very common at present. The reason seems to be that it is not easy to purchase a car. British automobile factories are working hard on exports and cannot take care of the domestic market at the same time. Therefore, it is not easy to buy a car. Gasoline is controlled by the government. If we talk about the price of gasoline, it is quite cheap, about two shillings and three pence per gallon. A good small car can travel thirty miles per gallon. Westerners seem to rarely not know how to drive a car, and even less often hire a driver. Therefore, owning a car is not necessarily a luxury. The problem is probably the price of the car and the difficulty of purchasing it. At the same time, the restriction on gasoline is also quite strict.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<p>A common English person, according to my understanding, lives a very regular life. They go out to work in the morning, come back in the afternoon, and may go out for entertainment in the evening, or listen to music or lectures on the radio at home. Here, owners of radios must pay an annual usage fee of one pound. It is said that the broadcasting company collected more than ten million pounds last year. The population of Britain is about fifty million, so on average there is one radio for every four people, which is of great benefit to the British people. In ordinary families, some families have everyone out during the day, either working or going to school. There are also some housewives who do not go out to work. To be honest, most British housewives are very admirable. Labor is very expensive here, so very few families hire "workers." Even if they do, it is often "part-time," either coming for a few hours each day, or a few times each week, to do some of the things that housewives think need help with. It is rare to find a maid who lives with the master's family for twenty-four hours a day, as in China. In principle, housewives here probably bear all the "administration" of a family, such as cleaning the house, buying groceries, cooking, etc. They are indeed very hard working. Of course, one thing that gives them an advantage over Chinese women is that the equipment here is better than that in China, and some tasks are easier to perform.</p>
<p>Stability</p>
<p>The British way of life may not be accustomed to by Easterners in some respects, but from the perspective of those who are accustomed to it, it is generally very enviable. The war has caused some damage to Britain and reduced some of the enjoyment of the British people, but on the other hand, many things are indirect benefits that the war has given to the British people. The government's subsidies for food have provided a lot of assistance to those with lower incomes. The changes in the wartime tax system and the effectiveness of some controls have somewhat shortened the distance between the rich and the poor in Britain. At present, Britain has some economic difficulties, but in general, very few people are unemployed nationwide, and they are living a disciplined life with a standard that is still much higher than that in China. Their people, at least from the perspective of us foreigners, have very few worries. The government is almost responsible for all the problems in the lives of all the people, which is related to the long-term stability of their domestic politics. Every time I pay attention to the lives of the British people, I always worry about the lives of our people. I am aware that improving the living standards of the Chinese people requires one condition, namely, political stability. This may be the goal that every Chinese person should strive for.</p>
<p>Hard Work</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say that before I came here, I thought that this place must be as luxurious and wasteful as Shanghai, but after I have lived here for some time, I think that what the British people are worth paying attention to is perhaps secondary to their material possessions. Their spirit of hard work, simplicity, practicality, calmness, and lack of exaggeration is worthy of our example.</p>
<h3>Jurong Strengthens Self-Defense Capabilities; Funds and Weapons Raised Locally</h3>
<p>[Report from Jurong, 20th] In order to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of various counties in response to emergencies, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered each county to establish local troops for self-defense. In order to understand the situation of this organization, the reporter visited County Magistrate Chen Tianzhi. According to him, the county will soon establish a security regiment. The organization will be based purely on local principles. The province will only be responsible for supervision and command, and the funds and weapons will be raised locally. As for the organization and establishment, the county security battalion will first be reorganized into one battalion, and the standing self-defense teams in each township will be established into one battalion. Once the funds and weapons are secured, another battalion will be expanded. The provincial government has appointed Yuan Deliang, the mayor of Qiaotou Town in this county, to serve as the regiment commander.</p>
<p>All men in the county aged eighteen to forty-five will be organized and trained in two phases. The first phase, which has been strictly supervised and trained by all levels, is about to expire and has been very effective. In order to develop local weapons, each organized civilian is ordered to be equipped with a knife or spear for self-defense.</p>
<p>The Recruitment Office for Intellectual Youth of the Army Training Command recently sent Deputy Director Yang Renxiang to the county to recruit intellectual youth aged eighteen to twenty-five at the County Council Hall to be sent to Taiwan for training. It is reported that since registration began on the 12th of this month and up to today (the 20th), applications have been very enthusiastic, especially among students from Yuzhou Lin Middle School.</p>
<h3>The Life of the British People: Simple, Stable, and Practical</h3>
<p>— Ben Geng</p>
<p>[Report from London, 10th via airmail] This report is not a monograph, but some "miscellaneous notes." The reporter hopes that this report will enable domestic readers to understand the lives of the British people after the war and to be vigilant.</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<p>It is said that the British used to be very particular about "clothing," but now it seems to be just neat and clean. Even on the busiest streets of London, which has a population of nine million, it is not easy to see outlandish or brightly colored clothes. Except for formal banquets, ordinary men often wear a tweed jacket and flannel trousers, which can be worn all year round. As for those who wear a full suit, the material and style are also very ordinary. If there is anything to be particular about, it is only that they pay more attention to the cleanliness of their shirt collars than Chinese people who wear Western clothes. Perhaps due to the climate, in addition to ordinary clothes, a coat that can be used for both sunny and rainy weather seems to be possessed by everyone, and they rarely do not carry or wear it. The summers here do not often make people feel hot. This summer, as far as I can remember, except for a few days in late July when it was very hot, the temperature was usually only around sixty or seventy degrees Fahrenheit, which seems to have a considerable impact on the fact that clothes can be worn all year round. The clothes worn by women also do not make us feel that they are "luxurious." "Simple" is the impression that clothes here give me. This situation may be related to the current clothing control. Last year, everything worn by each person, from head to toe, was almost completely controlled by the government, except for hats. Each person has four "points" of clothing coupons per month, but a suit requires twenty-six points of clothing coupons. The recent control situation has been relaxed relatively. In May, in addition to the four points that everyone should have each month, twelve points were issued to each person. Shoes and ties are no longer controlled. Although some clothes still require "points," the number of points required has begun to decrease. For example, a suit has been reduced from twenty-six points to twenty points. Although Britain is famous for its textile industry, the best materials are probably used for export. What can be bought domestically seems to be very simple. I think the relaxation of clothing control may allow people to have more new clothes, but it may not change the frugal atmosphere here.</p>
<p>Diet</p>
<p>In terms of diet, both quality and quantity are controlled, but recently it has been slightly relaxed. For example, bread and domestically produced jam no longer need to be purchased with coupons. As far as we know, the British government has considerable subsidies for food, so the price of food may be higher than the increase in all prices after the war. the harbor. We must not only ensure that their salaries are sufficient, but also consider various appropriate recreation facilities and sanitary equipment for them so that the members can enjoy physical and mental health and happiness in addition to serving.</p>
<p>Men and women participating in the Auxiliary Services do not need to receive military training. They only undertake civil defense work, but if there is a war, then that is another matter.</p>
<p>The "Hong Kong Defense Force Bill" is divided into six parts, with a total of thirty-seven articles, of which the second part, "The Governor's Power to Declare Mobilization Orders in Times of Emergency," is of utmost importance. It is expected that it will be fully passed between January and February of next year, and Hong Kong's civilian armed force will be formally born, adding a layer of security to society.</p>
<p>Governor Grantham is a far-sighted politician. His recent series of statements and actions have won widespread support and praise from the general public. Cooperation between the Hong Kong government and the good people is the best way to maintain law and order and prevent communist bandits from disrupting.</p>
<h3>Bribery Case for Privately Releasing a Traitor: Cao Gengsheng Sentenced to Fifteen Years; Bail Bond Chen Xiuliang and others not guilty</h3>

Bailiff Zhou Jiucheng had heard the news and fled. Cao Gengsheng was arrested in Shanghai. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted for corruption. The Criminal Court sentenced him on the 19th: Cao was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for identity profiteering, and deprived of public rights for ten years. Yang Shijie and the bail bond Chen Xiuliang were not guilty.</p>
<h3>News in Brief</h3>
<p>Zhengyang</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The usurious rates of high-interest loans are shocking, reaching a daily interest rate of two and a half percent, and the fate of commerce is on the verge of crisis. It is hoped that the local bank will open its vaults to provide relief.</p>
<p>Jurong</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to prepare for permanent famine relief, the Grain Storage Management Committee has built fifteen grain storage warehouses on the east side of the People's Education Center in the north of the city, which will be completed within the year. The grain accumulated from land taxes over the past two years (totaling more than 20,000 dan) will be recovered and stored immediately. At the same time, in order to strengthen township telephones, all branch lines have been completed.</p>
<p>Also: The county's highest institution of learning (County Middle School) has built a library building to enrich students' extracurricular reading, which was completed last month.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>[Report from 21st] The Hengjing Town Office here convened a rent collection meeting on the 20th, gathering the heads of the Baojia system, because the rent-paying atmosphere was stubborn and weary. However, some villagers appealed for a postponement or exemption. Unexpectedly, Xia Daming, who suffered from mental illness, and Shi Xiaoer, a villager from the Second Bao, uttered absurd words, and when stopped, a conflict arose. The self-defense team fired warning shots, but it was difficult to achieve the desired effect. After a standoff all night, the matter was resolved after persuasion by the authorities.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The eighth meeting of the County Council was opened on the morning of the 18th at 9:00 a.m. and closed successfully on the afternoon of the 20th at 4:00 p.m. Twenty-nine proposals were passed, the most important of which were: to effectively implement the 3-7 rent reduction, to reduce the discounted price of grain taxes, and to review the 1938 local revenue and expenditure budget.</p>
<p>Another report: Xu Diansheng, the former mayor of Qianmen Township, secretly reported to the District Prosecutor's Office this spring that Qin Jiefang, the deputy mayor, had murdered his younger brother Qin Yishu on the evening of the middle of the ninth lunar month of the 31st year of the Republic of China, a tragic event that was shocking. The District Prosecutor's Office investigated several times and excavated the remains at the burial site. After examining the external shape and structure, they found that it was different from human bones, so no prosecution was made. At the same time, Qin Jiefang's father, Zanwen, and his son Yishu disappeared at the same time as his brother Yutao in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China, and there has been no news of them since. Now that Xu has accused Jiefang of murdering his younger brother, and no prosecution has been made, he should be held responsible for false accusations. Qin has also filed a public lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office. Xu applied to the High Court for reconsideration, but the District Prosecutor's Office disapproved it on the grounds that the informant was not allowed to apply for reconsideration under the law. The Criminal Court of the District Court opened a trial on the 18th and, considering that there was still a need to investigate the facts of the case, ordered that the trial be postponed to a later date.</p>

<h3>Central China Today: Weeping Marks Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fang Canglang for This Newspaper</p>
<p>[Report from Xinyang, 18th for this Newspaper] Shi Dakai's poem contains the line: "Five aspirations unfulfilled, people are already suffering; weeping marks are everywhere in Central China." Descending to today, it can be a portrayal of the suffering people of Henan in general.</p>
<p>The war in northern Huai is raging, and the number of casualties among the bandit troops is staggering. According to merchants who recently came here from Zhengzhou, in the vicinity of Bian and Zheng alone, more than 30,000 wounded bandit soldiers have been gathered in the past ten days. In order to urgently replenish their troops, the bandit Central Plains Military Region has recently abandoned the "joining the army" rhetoric in Yu West, Yu North, and Yu East counties and has been rounding up men everywhere. All males between the ages of fourteen and forty-five cannot escape. Yu East and southwestern Lu, bordering Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, have become the bandit army's forward supply bases.</p>
<p>Three Extractions and Five Demands, Transactions Halt</p>
<p>On the land of the nearly 30 counties mentioned above, all the oxcarts, mules, and horses owned by the people have been searched and emptied by the bandits. In various places, grain merchants have completely ceased trading because the food owned by the people has been exhausted under the "three extractions and five demands." Poor farmers starving to death on the roads of Shangqiu and Minquan in Yu East can be seen everywhere. In the area bordering Yu and Lu, because Liu Fei has entered and exited here more than a hundred times, the prices of infants are particularly tragic. A girl weighing ten catties can only be exchanged for seven catties of sweet potatoes or three catties of millet. Old farmers who sell their children cry frequently on the barren land, but when they see female political workers of the bandits arriving for "proclamation and comfort," they force a smile and learn to sing Yangko.</p>
<p>Handling Youth, A Lot of Thought</p>
<p>From the mouths of refugee students and merchants coming from the north, we can see that after the bandits changed their political strategy, they have put a lot of thought into the disposal of youth in the captured areas, and their cunning and vicious methods are also worth noting. About two months before the abandonment of Zheng and Bian, a certain review meeting of Liu Fei's Central Plains Military Region decided on a vicious calculation of "rather kill ninety-nine out of a hundred." After that, wherever the red flag went, captured young students left ninety-nine out of every hundred to attack the city, releasing one to attack hearts and minds. Thus, within the captured areas, one could see thousands upon thousands of young students being tricked into "joining the army," throwing themselves into a sea of blood, and becoming cannon fodder in an instant. And the few young people released under the "kill ninety-nine out of a hundred" calculation, on the way south, under clever arrangements, actually had food and lodging at every stop, with strangers paying their bills, as if they were being sent off. Thus, these few percent, who only ate a few steamed buns and drank a few bowls of boiled water, unknowingly quietly brought similar toxins, free of charge, across the front lines of the National Army, to the rear of the government, and to some relaxed defensive positions. This effect cannot be said to be small. If the education authorities forget about these very hungry and thirsty little mouths and only play "little tricks," then it is not enough to talk about struggle, let alone total war.</p>
<p>Pinghan Railway Line, North and South Present Conditions</p>
<p>The war, which kills people across the fields, is cruel, but behind the cruel reality, if there are some more cruel masks and bad things hidden, the common people will suffer unspeakably. Now, just talking about the quiet Pinghan Railway, north and south: The people in the north, because the bandits constantly force them to contribute guns and food and are terrified of the so-called general liquidation after eight months, are doing everything possible to flee to Xiang and Deng. The common people in the south, living in areas far from both sides of the railway, are also busy fleeing because they cannot bear the demands and frights of a few local troops with poor military discipline. Thus, between Hankou and Xinyang, because of the coal shortage, the ordinary express train, which only runs once a day, is always crowded to the point of being impenetrable, which seems abnormal.</p>
<p>Life and Death Are Difficult, A Calamity</p>
<p>According to a Henan Provincial Councilor, it is really difficult for the Chinese common people to live or die these days. The people living in Suiping, Xiping, and Shangcai, which are no-man's-lands north or east of Zhumadian, often suffer multiple disasters. Today you come, tomorrow he goes, and all are inevitably subjected to a calamity. Merchants selling tobacco and cotton, after paying eight kinds of so-called self-defense and public welfare donations in the north, still have to complete eight paths when they arrive in the south. However, under the government's jurisdiction, the tax rate is lighter. Although the bandit area says it allows a small amount of cotton and Xuchang tobacco to be exported, it taxes them fiercely. Cotton is taxed at more than 40%, and tobacco is taxed at 200%, and additional extortion is demanded. Leaving that aside, let's look again at the lives of the people along the Xinhuang Highway, which is only a hundred kilometers long. Because a few bandits have recently been constantly robbing commercial vehicles and people, the speed of material exchange in various places along the Xinhan line has been greatly reduced, and it also looks haggard. The Xinhuang area is a land of fish and rice in southern Henan, and the people's sense of security is also more sensitive. Their view of Chairman Zhang Zhen is that he is a symbol of stability, so their hopes are also very high.</p>

<h3>Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament: Championship Suddenly Changes, Morning Friends Fails at the Last Hurdle, Crushed by Healthy Joy, Return Strength Fortunately Regains the Opportunity to Compete for the Title</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament reached its final stage last night. Morning Friends, with eight wins and no losses, faced Healthy Joy in their final battle to complete their championship ambition. However, things didn't go as planned, and they fell short at the last hurdle. The veterans of Healthy Joy displayed their prowess, defeating Morning Friends with a score of 51 to 30. In the first half, Healthy Joy led by four points with a score of 21 to 17. Although Healthy Joy defeated Morning Friends, they still had no hope of winning the championship, having already lost twice. This indirectly gave Return Strength another opportunity to compete for the title. Morning Friends and Return Strength now each have eight wins and one loss, and they will reschedule a match to determine the champion. The YMCA gymnasium was exceptionally lively last night.</p>
<p>First Half: A Back-and-Forth Battle</p>
<p>At 6:01, the two teams took to the court. Liu Hesheng and Zheng Zhifang were the referees. Morning Friends' lineup included He Zengchuan, Fu Qixia, Wang Rongsheng, Wang Bingfu, and Liang Xiong Biao. Healthy Joy's lineup consisted of Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Liangxiong, Zhang Xianlun, Fu Jinsheng, and Yan Shilu. Upon contact, Zhang Liangxiong of Healthy Joy committed a foul, and He Zeng made one of his free throws. Wang Rongsheng followed up with another successful shot, giving Morning Friends a 3-0 lead. Yan Shilu of Healthy Joy scored, but Liang Rongbiao immediately retaliated. Zhang Liangxiong of Healthy Joy made a free throw and then followed up with a basket, giving Healthy Joy a 5-4 lead, their first lead of the game. Morning Friends called a timeout. Fu Qixia made his free throw, tying the score at 5-5. Afterwards, the two teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with the score tied at 6-6 and 8-8. After tying at 14-14, Morning Friends took the lead again at 16-15. However, this lead was short-lived, as Healthy Joy became active again. At the end of the first half, Healthy Joy led by two baskets with a score of 21-17.</p>
<p>Second Half: Morning Friends' Decline</p>
<p>After the break, both teams maintained their original lineups. Zhang Liangxiong broke through the defense and scored. Healthy Joy's momentum did not diminish. The players of Morning Friends tried to attack, but their luck was not on their side, and their shots repeatedly missed. As a result, they fell further and further behind, with the point difference exceeding ten. After the score reached 39-27, Wang Rongsheng was fouled out after committing his fifth foul, and Shi Jiuquan replaced him. At the same time, they called a timeout to discuss countermeasures. Indeed, they showed some improvement for a while, and Wang Bowen and others scored some points. However, Healthy Joy was unwilling to relax, so the overall situation remained largely unchanged. In the last one or two minutes before the end of the game, Fu Qixia of Morning Friends also retired, and Ji Youkun was substituted off. By this time, the point deficit was large, and it was difficult to revive their offensive. When the final whistle blew, Healthy Joy defeated Morning Friends with a score of 51-30. Morning Friends will have to face Return Strength again to determine the champion. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Healthy Joy Throw Free Throw Fouls Points</p>
<p>Fu Jinsheng 3 2 3 8</p>
<p>Zhang Xianlun 8 0 4 16</p>
<p>Wu Chengzhang 2 5 3 9</p>
<p>Zhang Liangxiong 5 4 3 14</p>
<p>Yan Shilu 2 0 2 4</p>
<p>Total 20 11 15 51</p>
<p>Morning Friends Throw Free Throw Fouls Points</p>
<p>He Zeng 2 3 4 7</p>
<p>Fu Qixia 1 1 4 3</p>
<p>Wang Rongsheng 4 2 5 10</p>
<p>Wang Bingfu 2 2 3 6</p>
<p>Shi Jiuquan 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Liang Xiong Biao 1 2 2 4</p>
<p>Ji Youkun 0 0 0 0</p>
<p>Total 10 10 18 30</p>
<p>In the final game, Group A saw another match between Chun Mao and Xin Sheng. The former was more skilled, and Xin Sheng could hardly escape their fate. At the start of the game, Chun Mao took the lead. Xin Sheng did not lose heart and fought hard. The score difference was not too great. At the end of the first half, Chun Mao led 32-21. In the second half, Chun Mao continued to play smoothly, and Xin Sheng could not raise their heads. However, the battle became increasingly fierce. Xin Sheng fought desperately and worked hard. By the end of the game, Xin Sheng lost to Chun Mao with a score of 43-58.</p>
<p>In a Group B match last night, Yong An Yong defeated Shan Lan by one point with a score of 19-18.</p>

<h3>University Basketball: Finals on Saturday, Held at the City Gymnasium</h3>
<p>This year's university basketball tournament is scheduled to hold the finals of the university, college, and women's groups at the City Gymnasium on the 25th (Saturday) starting at 2:30 PM. Tickets are two yuan upstairs and five yuan downstairs. The first game is the women's group final between Hujiang and St. John's. Hujiang has famous players such as Wang Shan, but the St. John's women are also not weak, so there will be a fierce battle. The college group final is between Fazheng and Lixin. The former has extraordinary strength, and although Lixin is not to be underestimated, it may be difficult to challenge their strength. The final match of the university group is the overall final between the top team of the "university" division, Jiaotong University, and the champion of the "college" division, St. John's. Both sides have famous players and are evenly matched, so it is uncertain who will win. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Hujiang vs. St. John's (Women's Final) 2:30 PM</p>
<p>Fazheng vs. Lixin (College Final) 3:30 PM</p>
<p>St. John's vs. Jiaotong University (University Final) 4:30 PM</p>

<h3>Winter Relief Football Charity Match: Lineups of Chinese United and Western United Teams Announced</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Winter Relief Football Charity Match initiated by Mayor Wu is scheduled to be held at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the 26th of this month (Sunday). The official lineups of the Chinese and Western teams have been announced by the responsible authorities on both sides. Each team will have 15 players. The Chinese United team was selected and arranged by the Football Committee, and the Western United team was selected by the International Sports Association. The lists are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese United Team</p>
<p>Xu Fusheng (China Aviation)</p>
<p>Yan Shixin (Qingbai) Wu Qixiang (Zhichao)</p>
<p>Xue Peiran (Qingbai) Meng Yiliang (Qingbai) Gao Baozheng (Railway)</p>
<p>Jin Lusheng (Qingbai) Luo Shoufu (Qingbai) Qu Yongfu (Qingbai) Gao Xiuqing (China Aviation) Lin Dianyi (Railway)</p>
<p>New reinforcements: Wang Baoshan (Longtou), Wu Kaimin (Longtou), Fei Chunhua (Qingbai), Chen Qin (Longtou).</p>
<p>Western United Team</p>
<p>Xue Dekefu (Western Red)</p>
<p>Xu Erz (White Eagle) Carlo Liequ (Jewish)</p>
<p>Griffiths (Western Red) Tiefuni (Red Star) A. Oliveira (Portuguese Merchant)</p>
<p>Begeny (Western Red) Gabby (Rowing Club) Robert Stoff (Red Star) R. Korasha (Portuguese Merchant) Pan Lai (British Overseas Chinese)</p>
<p>Reserves: Sandirikoff (White Eagle Goalkeeper), Matthew Heath (Jewish), H. Santos (Western Red), Greenas (Red Star).</p>
<p>The Western United team combines old and new blood. Robert Stoff, Tiefuni, Carlo Liequ, and Xu Erz are all well-known intercity representatives in the football world. Goalkeeper Xue Dekefu is consistently stable, Griffiths is brave and good at fighting, A. Oliveira is a former intercity player and the younger brother of L. Oliveira, with a strong family background. The right wing abandoned Fuen and unusually recruited Pan Lai, a young player from Group B. His speed is amazing. R. Korasha and Gabby are both good at shooting. Begeny's hooking and scoring skills are top-notch. The whole team is well-coordinated and has amazing strength. Most of the foreign players are good at sprinting but weak in control. If the Chinese United team can prescribe the right medicine, avoid their strengths and attack their weaknesses, they may be able to win. Even if they don't, they won't be far off.</p>
