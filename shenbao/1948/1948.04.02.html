<h3>國大組織法修正公布　主席團計八十五人　今四次預備會進行推選</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國府令；修正國大組織法第五條條文公布之。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕修正國大組織法第五條文，擴充國大主席團名額案，國大秘書處卅一日午後趕送國府後後，經主席論「由本主席提案並即召開臨時國務會議討論」，一日晨國務會議特召開第二次臨時會議，討論此案，由孫科主持，討論後，決議原則通過，送立法院完成立法程序。立院亦於一日下午三時開第八次臨時會，提出討論，結果修正一個字，即將國大主席團主席自二十五人增至八十五人，討論時，各委員均以原草案並非立院起草，其僅列二十五人，係恐人數過多時發生阻滯，今事實適得其反，故對增加名額便於各單位意見達處理會務，並可多提供政治能力，訓練機會，會中意見並注重第五條關於主席幽主席之選舉方式之「互選」字樣，對國大預備會中各單位候選當選名額之議論，未加考慮，復爲免國大預備會對總名額再多爭持，拖延會期，而放棄不規定人數之議。關於人數有主五十九人者，有主九十九人者，結果鄧鴻業所提八十五人意見，得多人附議，以在塲六十三人中之四十八人多數贊成通過。修正後之國大組織法第五條條文爲；國民大會設主席團，由出席代表互選八十五人組織之，其職掌如左：（一）關於議事程序事項，（二）關於國民大會行政事項，（三）本法規定其他事項。（立院其他討論事項刊二版）</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國大定二日晨舉行第四次預備會議，仍由于斌主席，將根據修正後之國大組織法，討論大會主席團人數及選舉辦法，並即進行推選，俾早日舉行大會。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國大新聞組息：國大代表報到處，一日上午報到代表共五十四人。現報到總數已達二千一百六十四人，尙有代表二六零人在途，即可抵京。</p>
<h3>國大昨開三次預備會　代表席抽籖決定　並通過注意「會場和諧空氣」</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國大一日晨九時二十分開第三次預備會議，出席代表一六八七人，于斌主席，以一上午之時間，修正通過代表席次編定辦法，並當塲抽籤，決定各單位之次序。會塲秩序已較前兩日爲佳，登台發言最提供書面意見之代表，達三十餘人，對邊疆民族及華僑代表，均一致予以優遇，不參加抽籤，分配於前排地位，年老行動不便及盲目代表，則准予移坐主席團主席席次之空位。</p>
<p>預備會臨時秘書長洪蘭友，於討論前報吿籌委會起草代表席次編定辦法草案之原則，大致係根據上屆國大成規辦理，主張用單位制編定，俾各單位代表易於集中交換意見，各代表發言時，有主張即依報到先後者，有主張採混合抽籤者，有主張折衷兩法並用者，主席當就單位制與混合制先付表決，結果通過按單位制抽籤。並每單位代表之次序，辦法草案規定爲「依報到先後之次序」，經再度表決，通過修正爲「以抽籤決定之」。惟新疆，蒙古，西藏，邊疆民族，僑民五單位不參加單位抽籤，連同主席團共六個單位，排於前列，亦經全體代表同意。台灣原以語言關係，擬列入邊疆代表之內，嗣經臺灣代表表示，因國語推行順利，語言方面無大問題，願放棄優遇，參加抽籤，博得全塲掌聲。</p>
<p>全部單位序次一覽</p>
<p>單位抽籤於休息後由主席及秘書長當衆舉行，參加抽籤者共五十五個單位，結果如次：1工業團體，2江蘇，3廣東，4寗夏，5遼寗，6山東，7漢口，8湖南，9自由職業團體，10靑島，11綏遠，12山西，13興安，14北平，15安東，16全國性婦女團體，17農業團體，18貴州，19陜西，20重慶，21台灣，22河南，23青海，24遼北，25商業團體，26福建，27黑龍江，28吉林，29察哈爾，30湖北，31四川，32上海，33西安，34廣西，35大連，36內地生活習慣特殊國民，37浙江，38雲南，39合江，40敎育團體，41安徽，42南京，43哈爾濱，44漁業團體，45甘肅，46天津，47潘陽，48工礦團體，49熱河，50河北，51廣州，52江西，53西康，54松江，55嫩江。至各單位代表之抽籤，則由各單位自行召集。</p>
<p>一號席次無須保留</p>
<p>代表發言時，有人主張留第一號席次予蔣代表中正，以示崇敬。洪蘭友乃宣布，蔣代表迄今日止尙未報到，蔣代表於當選後曾聲明不願當選，惟渠現已收到當選證書，大會已爲國民政府主席在主席台上留有位次，故第一號席位無須爲將代表保留。此外，會中並通過臨時動議：（一）由秘書處公吿，各代表自由捐款，救濟下關難民。（二）注意會塲和諧空氣，代表發言時，各代表應靜心忍耐，勿報以噓聲。于斌並應代表之請，對昨日派代表慰問絕食這簽署代表經過，作簡單報告，至十一時卅五分散會。</p>
<h3>簽署當選國代問題　立院討論無結果　下代表絕食已歷五日</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕一日午後立院第八次臨時會議中，曾一度討論簽署題名當選國大代表問題，諶小岑等以十代表絕食問題嚴重，而讓與友黨之決議係根據擴大政府基礎原則，然應擴大及於民衆，不應不承認民主民意，倘注意黨之基礎，而忽略民衆基礎，實屬不當，故主張設法補救，使簽署代表依法當選，解決問題由立院建議國府，變通解決，使彼等自全國職業性團體產生出席大會。洪瑞釗則呼籲各黨應放遠限光，否則萬一發生意外，史筆決不饒恕污點，遺憾千古。陳顧遠，林彬認有關法律部份，須愼重考慮，蓋即自職業團體生產國代，必須有各該職團之會籍，且必經選舉，似難以立法建議或行使命令加以變通。周蜀雲等則堅主立院應注意法律立塲，對此政治糾紛，避免作無效果之牽涉，至比乃停止討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕簽署提名當選國代問題，一日仍未解決，下午三時許馬文俥·盛紫莊等謁陳立夫，商談甚久，未獲結諭。陳氏允與胡適等報吿蔣主席後再行商討。十代表一日仍繼續絕食，現已達第五日，一般身體均益疲憊。國大方面已請市立醫院醫師爲渠等隨時診視健康情形，並爲注射葡萄糖液，惟除楊翹新以年老體衰及張敷因有肺疾，經多人勸促接受注射外，餘均不願注射。又蘇銘芳·楊世麟兩絕食代表，已領得當選證書，於一日前往國大報到，但仍絕食。簽署代表一日晚復集議，有人主張請絕食者復食三日，以待政府解決，但有人反對，未獲通過。卅一日下午記者曾遍訪十絕食代表，渠等均表示，在未獲解決時，決一堅持到底，不願恢復飲食。卅一日竟日均有代表至渠等住處慰問，居院長正於卅一日下午四時亦曾親往慰問·國民大會並推派代表于斌·吳蘊初·胡定安·丁濟萬·徐梓楠·陳存仁等十人由洪蘭友陪同前往慰問。于斌等當勸十代表應以健康爲重，接受折衷辦法，先行列席，祖未被接受。</p>
<h3>首屆國大代表　分別組織誼會</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕全國性自由職業團體新聞記者·律師·技師·會訐師·中醫師·醫師等六單位國大代表二日中午於大會散會後聚餐，同時開會，公推馮有眞爲主席，經決議：（一）即日成立自由職業國代聯誼會，（二）抽定各單位大會席次，（三）各單位推定幹事，計（新聞記者）趙君豪·馮有嘆·劉威風。（律師）張且平·王善祥·余春華·（技師）顧毓璟·夏光宇。（會計師）蔡金瑛·何元明。（中醫師）賴少魂·了濟萬·（醫師）華淑君·范守淵。幷推定馮有眞爲召集人。（四）一致主張，大會主席團候選人，自由職業團體各單位至少應產生一人。（五）設辦事處於京中山東路一七零號上海中央日報駐京辦事處。</p>

<p>民主政治是尊重異端，尋求大同，民意的表現正貴乎有分歧。國民大會三天來的預備會議裏充滿了爭持，呌囂，乃至紊亂，正顯示着它的代表民意，也證明了它確是民主機構，所以，直到目前，恐怕除了蔣宇席之被選舉爲大總統不會有爭執外，任何一個決議都少不了爭論與吵鬧。在前兩天的預備會裏，爲了大會屯席團的名額問題，爭吵了兩天，作了立法院的反案文章，一日上午又爲了座次編定辦法，辯論的面紅耳赤。　在偌大的大會堂裏，記者們和制憲代表在前年都會看過梅蘭芳的戲，如果坐在樓上或樓下的後排，看也看不眞，聽也聽不淸，誰又不願意坐在樓下前排呢？國大會堂裏的座位不賣票，更沒有票價高低之別，但爲了議事的必需，又不能不對號入座，再加上每個人都想經常坐在較好的位置，爭先恐後實在是難免的事。籌備會秘書處也料到了這一點，便沿襲制憲國大的辦法，把這一問題的解決，付諸天命或曰機遇。依洪蘭友秘書長的看法，這提州的編座方式有例在先，不會有啥格問題，前一天逃脫了的臨時主席于斌主敎，也以爲蔫定通過，從容登台。　洪秘書長的金嗓子雖然已有些暗啞，但說話的聲浪和叙事的條理依然淸晰，他報吿代表席次編定辨法草案的擬訂情形以後，各代表開始發表意見，於是此上彼下，意見越來越多，秩序越來越亂，幸賴于斌聲音宏亮、處置有方，在洪蘭友的協助下，從亂絲裏理出頭緒，一條條淸淸爽爽，三十，卅一兩天上午纔有一項三分之一的決議，而一日上午則通過了一件究整的案子，國大的議事效率也有了增進　第一個發言的是西康藏族女代表鄧珠娜姆，她說應該依報到次序混合坐，因爲大家見面不易，如此可以多認識人，溝通各地同胞間尤其與邊疆同胞間了解，增進團結力量，才不怕野心家的挑撥，如若不能這樣，邊疆同胞來京不易，聽話不懂，應該坐前面，原來鄧代表的報到次序是第四號，又是藏族，順過來倒過去，她都得生法子坐前邊。出再一個意見是贊成分單位抽籤排定席次，但各單位代表個人的席次也不能循報到次序，也得抽籤，才算公平，否則以後開會前大家都要搶先報到還得了？這意見是報到次序第一二五六號代表芮晋提州來的，他報到晚，無論如何得有機會趕到前面去。　第三個意見是第四九六號代表劉萃提出的，以各代表個人爲單位抽簽決定全塲席次，他說各單位代表可在會外接觸聯絡，而不應該在會塲裏各自爲界，鴻溝分明，他徹底主張大混合。除了這三種主要的意見外，還有人主　　張機會均等，輪流直排和橫排，自然這此意見也各有反對意見，于斌就在這時聲稱：「歸納大家的意見，主要的是採單位制與混合制，混合制很好，我們這國民大會不僅是要以建民國，而且也符合了以進大同的目標了」。他笑着宜布依法先表決修正意見，贊成混合制的代表撳了電鈕，表決器上彩星處處，但出席在塲代表人數一九三三人，贊成的八〇六，少數，混合制意見否決了。</p>
<p>照善原草案逐條討論，第一條，第二條都無異議通過，到第三條又遇了風浪，　藏和邊胞與僑民要爭取坐在前面的舊有權利，有人又想起了尊重蔣主席和體卹年邁與殘疾的代表，有人則關懷台灣代表的國語，也都應該爲他們在前面留位置。意論紛紜中，有一位代表大聲疾呼：「華北東北共匪鬧的這麼兇，我們開了三天會決議些甚麼？邊疆代表和僑民代表也都是中國人，有甚麼道理特殊？我們要一視同仁，表決通過原草案」！在一片噓噓聲裏，在懂國語的新疆代表攘臂反對下，主席連喊「停止發言，停止發言」。</p>
<p>於是在會衆以一一二一票多數通過芮晋的提議把第三條第三項修正，又將第四條無異議通過後，方再轉回頭繼續把這些要往前坐的問題個個擊破，蔣主席在臺上有位置，年邁與殘疾的代表可以坐在登臺的輪値主席們的空位上，蒙藏邊胞與僑民坐在兩側的前面，台灣代表則自承國語無問題不願搶先，敬謝關懷，於是于斌說：「單位抽籤，當塲舉行，由我與洪秘書長唱對臺戲吧」！于斌唱省名，洪蘭友唱號碼，開籤結果，在前的鼓掌，在後的啞笑，爭先搶後，盡人事，聽天命。</p>
<h3>國大表決器　將正式試驗</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕表決器之設備，國內僅國大會堂有之，上屆制憲國大曾予以使用，本屆國大已開預備會三次，若干代表對此機器表示懷疑，一日並有代表提請檢查。秘書長洪蘭友當答覆踢球：各代表願參觀表決器者，請於每日開會半小時前，隨時前往參觀，大會舉行之日，將舉行正式試驗，俾釋羣疑。</p>

<h3>社論　發行短期庫券的問題</h3>
<p>關於短期庫劵的發行問題，各方意覓，殊不一致；有極力主張的，也有深表懷疑的。我們以爲這個問題的解答，應視庫券發行的旨趣爲標準。</p>
<p>照通常說來，凡短期庫劵的發行，不外兩種目的：一種是財政上的目的，即以季節上的關係，國庫偶感不足時，即發行此等短期債券，以資調　，所以稱爲庫劵，一俟牧入較裕，仍予收回。另一種是金融上的目的，即在銀根浮濫，籌碼太多時，酌量發行庫券，以資調節。其與公債不同之點，乃在前者爲臨時性的，而後者卻是比較地長期的。至與鈔票比較，則除收回的期間有差別外，一有利息，有折扣，一無利息，無折扣。所以單從財政上立論，自以增發鈔票較爲有利。</p>
<p>今以通貨過於於膨脹，不便再行增發鈔票，乃改發短期庫券，並以比爲手段，用以收囘一部份鈔票，這在國庫上，不免增加了若干負担，其用意自無可厚非。凡擁護這項政策的，其着眼點亦即在是。現在市上的遊資，確乎太多了。諸凡物價狂漲，投機旺盛，以及民生困苦，經濟凋做等現象，無不以此爲主要的病根。而吸收遊資，抽緊銀根，又苦無其他切實的對策。則短期庫券的發行，我們自然希望它順利進行，能　致預期的效果。</p>
<p>不過發行庫劵是一事，而能否吸收　資，獲致預期的效果，却又是一事。因爲厚券與法幣，在形式上，性質上，雖各不相同，而其爲自由流通的籌碼則一。且其單位特別大，周轉亦很伏，如果財政上的意味過於濃厚，發行的技術上稍一不慎，則很可能地蛻變爲鉅額的法幣，反而增加了遊資的數量。</p>
<p>關於是項庫劵的發行條例，現在還沒有公佈。問其發行額，折扣率，俱沒有硬性規　。一切按照實際需要委托中央銀仃在公開市爲，斟酌辦理·　們希望央行，在公開發行的時候，務須悉心斟酌，愼重辦理了　　做到吸收一部份遊資的地步；縱退一步想，亦不可過於　發，致增加遊資，加深通貨膨脹的惡性。</p>
<p>現在市塲睹息，高至三四角，要求庫券發行的順利，自不得不提高折扣，以引起一般人之興趣；從而收回首批到期庫劵時，即不得不比首批加額發行，以資應付。是則庫劵將態發愈多，遊資將與日俱增，而國庫的負祖，也將　長增高了。許多人鰓鰓過慮，認爲將來結果，恐未必良好，其理由即左於是。我們爲　同庫劵的信用起見，頣提出幾項建議：第一收回首批到庫　時，不可完全仰給於新庫劵的換發，至少一部份，須以其　財源來補充；第二發行數額不宜過大，亦不宜發行太急，的確須依照實際需要來決定。此外，還有一點，似亦値得一提，即庫券的發行，　係委托央行，公開辦理，　不會蹈過去扱派的覆　，但按成搭發這個老例十，亦務須力求避免，一新一般人之耳目。此項庫券，其最低額定爲一千萬元，對於一切薪　的發放，因爲數目太鉅，實際自不適用。所可慮的是各種貸款，爲數旣鉅，需要尤急。過去常有籌碼太少，緩不濟急等情事。我們以爲此等需要，仍應另想辦法，不可拿庫劵來抵充，致失去了原來的意義。</p>
<p>總而言之，發行庫券，首應認淸目標，次應認定目標，若以吸收遊資爲目標，就該自始至終，以此爲目標，法不錯亂或迷失，在這種情形之下，發行短期庫劵，凡是國人都是應該表示擁護的。</p>
<h3>立法院臨時會議　討論國庫券條例草案　最後決定重行付審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立法院一日臨時會議，討論「中華民國三十七年短期國庫劵條例」草案，該草案係央行接受四聯秘書處根參卅七年貸款方針案，委託該行參照市面利率，發行國庫期票事密函而擬就者，於三月三日函送財部，廿四日轉呈政院，復經核可，並於廿五日呈達國府，於廿六日國務會護通過，交立院完成立法程序，經財委會一日長審查修正後，提出當日午後臨時會議。絛例草案要點爲：由政府授權央行，發行一個月，二個月，三個月三種短期庫券，面額一千萬元，五千萬元，一億元，五億元，十億元五種，均爲不記名式，月息五分，到期日本息倍付，發行數額以實銷數目爲準，不加限制，央行並得視市塲資金供求情形，將該券升値或折扣發行或先期購回。此項草案經陳長蕪設明審查修改經過後，孫九錄，劉通，陳紫楓，洪瑞釗等相繼發言反對，僉認草案第一案所懸目標欲藉此種庫券「安定金融吸收游資穩定幣値」實屬過高。孫九錄並以美金庫券公債之例，認爲合法利潤不逮暗息遠甚，法幣信用如不能維緊，其結果亦將勞而無功。洪瑞釗則指出庫劵效果可疑，然使庫券之發行變爲政府與商人爭作投機，沾辱政風，並由升値貶値之無定，反滋弊端，則屬易事，最後決定重付審查。</p>

<p>這位女縣長的抱負，眞不算小，這是由於她具有政治遠見。因爲要運動婦女，必須要懂得羣衆心理，會操縱會塲，善競爭選舉，這一套，我們許女士在近五六年中間，早已苦練而得。貴州省，其實也就是貴陽市的婦女運動，許女士及其胞姊　　　女士所領導的市婦女會，與陳　所領導的省婦女會，其力量足可分庭抗禮。許　長從事婦女選舉有年，自己也能苦幹實幹，姐夫又是主管全名敎育的人，更能得到不少帮助。</p>
<p>爭選立委　以退為進</p>
<p>半年以前、許縣長爲活動立法委員黨內提名，爭不　　　政敵，一時心窄，驟然在貴　　　　　上刋登說　啓事，　使許多致治人　　到　異。　這一着以　爲這的手　，並未能獲得　　　名，那時建　是　　氣，　　不安。　　一，總經濟公佈立委　　人名軍，　長沒得她的芳名，於是建便一而再，再而三的糾集同其命運的份子，加上三五百名婦女，向省參議會，省黨部，省選所，繼續不斷的請願，以免數年活動，虧於一簣，結果碍於法令，未得如願。臨到立委選舉之時，許女士恩怨分明，芳心一橫，率性把自己早已把握着的大多數選票，一律讓給民社黨婦女立委候選人楊怡如小姐，總要使想控制選票的人吃個鴨蛋。政治鬥爭是無感情可言的，惟婦女畢竟脆弱，難免不受感情激動。臨到選舉立委那天，貴陽市新聞界要看主幕娘兒們爭選的好戲，都絕不放鬆許女士投票所在。那天，她觸景生情，所投的票，是：「楊怡如」三個大字·</p>
<p>把握時機　施展抱負</p>
<p>這不算稀奇，　事通之後，愈想愈不甘心，想到成都有個「官大砲」，可以接二連三的控吿市長，因而揚名海四，自已受了這樣大的美曲，何不取法乎官，也來這一手？我們許女士遵到高等法院控吿省選所遠法，害得省選所　夜趕　聲復文書，忙　不停．</p>
<p>許女士體格健壯，精神飽滿，比次參加實際政治，正是最應該　　住的一飯大好援會．息烽是風景名區，距離貴陽市僅七十三公里，且　抆到那裏去施展她的一切抱負吧。</p>

<h3>蘇聯突實施嚴格管制　柏林東西交通阻斷　英美法佔領當局嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕英軍用火車一列，在奉令以武力阻止任何人登車之衛隊的保護下，於蘇聯突然宣布加緊限制東西邊界交通之辦法施行前之前小時駛出柏林。英國其先巳聲明拒絕蘇聯當局之此項新限制，法國繼之，美國聲明亦將有同一表示。蘇當局頒佈之新措施，係於廿四小時前通知西方佔領國，規定自蘇聯區進人西區之一切人等，無論軍民，一槪須持有過境護照，所有貨運一概須鮮方先在區邊界總在柏林城外實施檢查。蘇方之加緊邊界管制通知，係於卅一日夜由蘇軍政府副長官特立特文中將遞交西方三佔領國。其先英國當局已請蘇當局展期十五天施行此項新辦法，俾西方三當局得與蘇代表討論此事。自蘇當局通知決如期實行後，英軍總司令部參謀長勃隆　中將即致函蘇方，際明英國決拒絕蘇方人員之檢查貨運及盟國人員須有過境護照等點。法軍政府副長官諾亞萊少將亦已函覆特拉特文中將，拒絕蘇方之加緊管制邊界新描施，並聲明此項措施須依四强基礎決定之。另據向柏林法當局登記之德文郵報載稱，柏林通至西方佔領區陸路交通孔道馬特保附近之公路兩側若干小村之居民，已由蘇當局下令遷移，此係表示蘇軍當局已在準備加築邊界駐軍及德範　士之營房，以增强邊界控制。</p>
<p>〔合衆社柏林一日電〕蘇聯一日切斷西方國家與柏林之陸上連絡，同時莫斯科電臺宣布稱，德國之解體乃「旣成事實」。</p>
<p>「真理報」稱，英美或將籍盟管會抗議柏林之孤立，該會「事實上已不復成為四強共管德國之最高機構」。蘇聞堅持彼等有權檢查前往柏林英美法區之車輛，而將柏林通往西部之交通切斷。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕柏林政界人士相信，蘇方之加緊管制交通這，殆為蘇方迫使盟國退出柏林之第一步，接近蘇軍政府之人且曰，蘇方態度堅決執行此項新辦法到底，彼等且已擬且計劃以應付西方國家拒絕遵行時所引起之局勢。</p>
<h3>英美軍用車被阻　美改用空中運輸</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕柏林美軍政府一日晨宣布，業已取消出入柏林之軍用列車，而改用飛機運輸。自美軍佔領區弗朗克福至柏林美軍控制之頓貝霍甫機塲，將增加時特別航空班。自蘇方頒布之限制過境辦法於三十一日午夜實行後，自柏林開出之第一列美軍列車在馬林逢站聽候蘇方人員檢查達三十分鐘後，始繼續西開，其後自勃萊美港開柏林之美軍列車及自法朋克福開柏林之美軍時快車，均因隨車美軍官拒絕蘇方人員登車檢查，遇阻折回，　在馬林蓬站被蘇方所扣之英軍列車二列迄尙未有消息。英軍車之被扣，係因隨車英負責軍官根據上峯指令，不許蘇方人員登車檢查之故。英軍政府已就此事向蘇當局提出抗議。美法預料亦將回蘇提出類似抗議。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林一日電〕德國新聞社訊；據自勃隆斯維克來此之流亡人民稱，數日來英蘇佔領區交界處之蘇方邊界衛隊人數大見增加。彼等並曰，除若干時定之點外，邊界不久將實行封鎖，非法越界者當予格殺。</p>
<h3>蘇芬締約談判擱淺</h3>

<p>（六）史迪肆引起的摩擦</p>
<p>一九四四年，在中美戰時聯盟到達最低潮的時候，中緬印戰區美軍司令史迪威考慮將美國第十四航空隊撤離中國　究竟他曾否向美國睦軍部提出過正式的建議，還是他不過運用它作爲史迪威對重慶最後威脅之一，我不預備說。祇有戰區的檔案或者在一九四四年史迪威被召回前參與其最後談判的人物之證言，可以充份透露其詳情。　在我看來，這是史油威爲擴大其在華權力，於採取種種步驟時根本不顧其可能影響的一個著例。鑒於當時中國的情形正在惡化之中，這種行動，甚至以這種行動相威脅，勢將引起完全混亂，假如這種威脅爲大衆所知的話。</p>
<p>在那時候，第十四航空隊乃是在華獲得大衆信任的唯一有效軍事力量。</p>
<p>不管這種辦法怎樣激烈，當時的確想促使中國當局注意及此的。我第一次獲悉這個消息，乃是中國人向我私下詢問的時候，他們希望知道這個計劃是否將被實施。戰區司令部對於這個問題並沒有供給我任何　現在回想起來，我想到當時第十四航空隊被派飛越　峯空運貨物的噸位銳减，交給中國機關的貨物也大見减少。在我猜想起來，這種减少乃是史迪威除眞正撤退空軍之外，對重慶實施壓力的另一辦法。　一九四三年秋季，也就是史迪威最後被召回的一年之前，戰區司令和蔣主席之間發生了一種磨擦，其嚴重程度幾乎和其後迫使史迪威離開中國的情形相仿。事實上，幾乎要求把他免職。</p>
<p>當時史迪曾經由蔣夫人保證蔣委員長，就是他以後將聽從蔣委員長的意思和訓令。我曾目擊一部情形。這個保證似乎是在經過一番談話之後提出的。</p>
<p>我在離開這次集會時候，蔣夫人的姊姊孔夫人把我拉到一旁，並且使我相當感到離奇地吿訴我說：「史迪咸將軍已經允許服從蔣委員長了。」</p>
<p>一直到今天，我還不明瞭這個離奇的保證之來源，但我確信縱使史迪威想和蔣委員長保持最好的關係，可是作爲美軍戰區司令的他，未能在各方使他自己符合他的意志。</p>
<p>所以我假定他提出這個諾言，並無加以恪守的意思。應該加以指出的一點，乃是他們關於緬甸戰役最激烈的爭執，在一九四三年十一月開羅會議之後，立即開始發生。</p>
<p>根據我和中央政府相處的經驗，我發覺友好的坦白，乃是滿意解決相互問題的唯一先決條件。對於蔣委員長，我從未發覺有將眞相加以隱瞞的必要，不管眞相是怎樣不愉快。我一向把我所看到的事實，實事求是地吿訴他，假如局勢需要採取校正措置的話，這種措置就會來的。　不用說，在提出批評性的報吿之時，對於作爲中國最具有最決定性的人物之蔣委員長的地位，應該予以適當的尊重——但是不必磕頭。換言之，友好和有效的聯繋，祇需要一種對任何國家首長應有的自敬敬人的態度就可以了，假如這些國家的友誼和帮助是我們所重視的話。</p>
<p>史迪威整個留華期間損害了中美關係，而他辱駡的程度，在華盛頓決定將他召回之後的一次記者招待會上或許達到了最高峯。史迪威的說話當然是「不予發表」的，但是猶如許多「不予發表」的說話一樣，後來常常會被刊印出來。刋載這件事的一本「新聞週刋」我沒有保留起來，所以祗有靠記憶了。</p>
<p>在我回想起來，史迪威將軍在離開重慶時對蔣委員長所作的評價，乃是一種「欺人之談」。</p>
<h3>安理會將不顧蘇聯反對　澈底調查捷政變　蔣廷黻闡明我國立塲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖一日電〕聯合國安理會不顧蘇聯反對，似將下令調查蘇聯在捷克共黨政變中之地位，此案現定下週正式表決。蘇聯與烏克蘭雖均竭力反對，但中·美·英·法·加拿大及叙利亞六國則正式表示贊成，阿根廷，比利時及哥倫比亞亦有支特該案之意，法定多數爲七票。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅一日電〕中國代表蔣廷黻今日提議澈底調查捷克事件，將政變中主要人物召至安理會說明眞相，並希望蘇聯參加此種調查工作。蔣氏稱，安理會與全世界必須正視捷克問題，不應留待兩年或三五年之後。蔣氏並將捷克問題與東北國軍剿共戰事相提並論，謂捷克與中國之東北各省乃衝突之搖籃，兩處中有一發生特殊事故，均足震憾全世界。美國主張充分調查智利控訴蘇聯協助捷克共黨奪取政權各　，中國表示贊同。先是，智利代表克魯茲重申該國要求，促請安理會調查蘇聯在此次捷共政變中之地位，並指斥蘇聯爲一阻大妄爲之侵略者，不惜利用組暴之流氓手段。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅一日電〕捷克共產政府新任駐聯合國代表胡台克，今日以捷總統貝奈斯委任狀，向聯合國秘書長呈遞就職書，聲明前任代表巴本納克已撤職。巴氏仍拒絕承認新代表之就職書，謂非接貝奈斯總統親筆簽名之文，決不去聽。</p>

<h3>行總職員貪污宣判　侯藹昌蔣仁麟各處徒刑　董承道等五人無罪鄭仲和杜岑免訴　陸家駒火永彰倜民俟到案再審判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總高級職員被控貪污案，地院於昨日下午由黃光鈺庭長升座刑一庭宣判，判決主文：侯藹昌（前行總財務廳物資購銷處總經理），對於職務上之行爲，收受不正利益，處有期徒刑三年六月，褫奪公權四年。蔣仁麟（前行總福利科長）侵占公有財物，處有期徒刑三年六月，褫奪公權四年。以上二人其他部份無罪。董承道（財務廳長），胡可時（總務處長），陶景瑗（文書科長），龐元龍（福利科長），丁天生（聯合生記營造廠經理），均無罪，鄧仲和（安樂紡織廠總經理），杜岑（副總稽核）均免訴。茲將該項判決書要點摘錄於後：</p>
<p>侯藹昌部分　（甲）關於科刑部分—查侯藹昌係行總物資購銷總經理處總經理，起訴書認其經辦出售羊毛時，有收受安樂紡織公司經理鄧仲和贈屋居住之事，該屋坐落愚園路一三九六號九樓十五室，原屬鄧仲和所租賃，以及現爲侯藹昌居住，均爲不爭之事實，茲應審究者，即侯藹昌居住該屋，是否對於職務上行爲收受不正利益是已。按行總出售救濟物資之羊毛，安樂紡織公司承購一百十二萬磅，除國營之中紡公司外，其承購數量實居首位，業據該公司經理鄧仲和到庭供明，惟行總售給安樂公司羊毛合約，經查其內容條款，與其他承購者並無二致，自難以違背職務之行爲同論但該侯藹昌於經辦出售羊毛期間，果有無條件收受他人房屋居住，不能謂與職務上之行爲無關。次論侯藹昌是否為收受不正利益，換言之，即鄧仲和有無贈屋居住之行爲，訊據該鄧仲和辯稱：「該項房屋係由侯藹昌之親戚吳志衛向其轉租」等語，並於偵查中提出吳志衛於卅五年六月十五日致鄧仲和之信一件，及鄧仲和書與吳志衛之名片一張，以資佐證。檢察官認爲該函未經郵局轉遞，名片上字跡又係鉛筆書寫，均不難於事後串飾，所見甚是，况該屋旣由侯藹昌居住，又未與鄧仲和訂立租約，已可認有贈屋居住之行爲，本院爲探求事實眞相，即以該屋之電燈電話煤氣過戶等情形，分別行文滬西電力公司，上海電話公司，上海煤氣公司查詢。據上列三公司之覆函，均指戶名係侯藹昌，足證侯藹昌之居住該屋，顯與吳志衛無關，所謂由吳志衛承租一節，礙難置信。旣於經辦出售羊毛期內，收受他人房屋居住，則該侯藹昌對於職務上行爲，收受不正利益，證據自屬確鑿，應依懲治貪污條例第三條第四款處斷。惟念該被吿尙無違背職務行爲，且當時適値上海房荒，無法覓屋居住，衡情不無可憫，特予减輕本刑，酌科有期徒刑三年六月，並褫奪公權四年，以示懲儆。起訴書認犯同條例第二條第七款之罪，核與犯情不符，故變更起訴法條，併此釋明。</p>
<p>（乙）關於其他部分—出售電風扇，美棉換紗，因被吿無犯罪岡利之積極證據，依法應論知無罪。</p>
<p>蔣仁麟部分　（甲）關於科刑部分—查蔣仁麟所保管備用金五百萬元，係作預付旅館週轉金之用，以及曾預付南京飯店一百萬元，吳宮旅舍四十萬元，其他旅館尙未預付等情，均據該被吿自承不諱。當卅五年五月廿九日行總總賬務室檢查時，所存單據有私人墊款夾雜其中，此爲檢查報吿臀所載明。又該署調查處處長高淸孝亦奉令至該科檢查，此項備用金仍無賬簿記載，除交出現金九十萬元外，其支付單據未能一次交一閱，係陸續分三次檢出，首次交出之數字，計爲四，八四二，五〇〇元，少頃又改爲五，〇三二，五七〇元，旋又改爲五〇一一，九二〇元，最後審查瓷痰盂單據十九萬元，應予刪除，該科備用金所存數字，即爲四，八二一，九二〇元，相較少一七八，〇入〇元。該調查處處長高淸孝，不但作成書面報吿，復經當庭供明爲實，自堪置信。且當時蔣仁麟以瓷痰盂十九萬元，係其墊付，而經辦人陳廷昌則稱此款爲其所墊，有該署之訽問筆錄可憑，陳廷昌並加蓋私章於其上，何得藉詞圖卸，則被吿蔣仁麟有侵佔公有財物之行爲，要無疑義，應依懲治貧污條例第坧絛第二款處斷。惟念該彼吿僅佔數字無多，衡情不無可憫，特予减輕本刑，酌科有期徒刑三年六月，並榹奪公權四年，以示懲儆。</p>
<p>（乙）關於其他部份：瑞豐里日人留存傢具短少，修繕瑞豐里房屋，購置鐵床及辦公桌椅，被控營私舞弊，因證據不足，論知無　．</p>
<p>董承道等部份　其餘董承蓮，陶景瑗，胡可時，　元龍，丁天生，被訴各點，均缺乏積極佐證，依法慶論知無罪。</p>
<p>鄭仲和部份　至鄧仲和部份，支付侯藹昌不正利益時，在三十五年七月，起訴書認犯刑法第一百二十二條第三項之罪，核其最重本刑係三年以下有期徒刑，依照國府赦免减刑令甲項之規定，應論知免訴。杜岑部份，起訴書認一杜觸犯懲治貪污條例第九條之罪嫌，該條最重本刑爲三年以下有期徒刑，縱使被吿所犯實在，旣在三十五年十二月三十一日以前，按諸上開說明，應諭知免訴之判決。</p>
<p>尙有被吿陸家駒因公赴美，未得合法傳喚，俟到案後另結。又被告火永彰，陳倜民二名，飭拘不到，俟獲案後再行審判，併此釋明。</p>

<h3>穩定指數　籌新辦法　社會局長主張組織　日用呂聯合配銷處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市勞資評斷委員會第十八次會議，決議西函請社會局建議中央，增加職工實物配給種類及數量，（即米煤油糖之外增加服用品），並减低配價，藉以穩定指數，使不致逐月激增。社會局長吳開先昨向記者表示：「擴大職工日用品之配給，自爲抑低生活指數之最好辨法。但政府能力所够者，，皆已做到，目前再欲擴大配給，因物資缺乏，頗感因難。渠本人主張組織本市工人生活日用品聯合配銷處，由各廠以與生活指數有關之產品供給配銷處，依照成本配售予全市職工，如此職工可以低價獲得配給品，而生活指數亦可根據配價編製。社會局將於下週內約集本市若干重要工業同業公會負資人商討此事」。</p>
<p>一個問題尚難解決</p>
<p>吳局長並表示，該一辦法原則已定，但有一點困難値得考慮，即如機器廠水泥廠等不能供應聯配處以日用必需會品，但其職工工資則同樣欲依配價編製之生活指數計算，蓋當局祇能編製一種指數，而工廠之享受普一遍，義務亦須普遍。此點困難渠本人尙未想出解決辦法，將待下週會談時提出討論</p>

<h3>大耀電廠負責人　說明收電費真相</h3>
<p>所供電流　購轉饋　竊電過多損失浩大</p>
<p>距滬不遠之大塲，劉行，顧村等處電氣事業，向由大羅電氣廠經營，最近該處一部份用戶，因電費問題，至公用局等處請願，並招待記者，發表談話，認該廠所定電費，較市區爲高，表示不滿，中央社記者爲明瞭眞相起見，特走訪該廠負實人，據談：該處一帶因環境複雜，公司業務，無法推進，故勝利以後，初由王英如恢復　務，繼田榮玉德接辦均以收支不數，無法繼特。最近改組爲股份有限公司，並將業務委託遠東電氣投資公司代爲管理，其目的在謀業務及技術上之整理，以期减輕成本，作合理之發展。該廠並無發電設備，所供電流，係向本市閘北水電公司蔓購轉饋，故應收電價，根本上未能與市區一致，過去差額約爲增加百分之一百，事實上因竊電過多，及設備陳舊，僅損失電度一項，已在百分之五十左右。現自二月份改組爲股份有限公司後，所定電價，較購電成本僅加百分之五十，以全部收入，勉强繳付購電費，其他一切開支，完全無着。現在該公司竭力整頓，損失電度百分比，已略見降低，持之以恒，逐步改進，則將來用戶與公司，必能交受其益。該公司二月份電價，因尙未奉經濟部核定，目前暫照一月份電價收取，俟核定以後，有餘發還，不足補收，故是否較從前電價爲高，抑係减低，是否剝削用戶圖謀暴利，屆時有事實證明。且該處各用戶依照一月份電價先行繳付者，已佔百分之八十以上，可見多數用戶，俱能瞭解，少數用戶，實屬有所誤會云。</p>

<h3>中交兩行循序進行　本年度貸款方案　貸欵性質分國策業務定貨三類</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中國交通兩銀行本年度貸款方案，自經四聯總處通過原則後，大致將循國策，業務，定貨三大類進行核貸。貸　性質，大致如次：（一）國策貸款：係由四聯總處通過後，交由中交兩行核貸。近已通過核貸資源委員會款項計一萬九千三百億元。該款聞將田山交兩行，各半承貸。中交兩行，得以七折向中央銀行辦理轉抵押手續。此筆貸款，刻正由資委會與中交兩行接洽借貸中。（二）業務貸款：總額雖已核定一萬二千億元，內中交兩行各佔半數，惟該項貸款，尙須俟中央銀行新貼放委員會成立後，方能開始核貸。該項貸款，得以八折向貼放委會辦理轉抵押轉貼現。（三）定貨貸款：由中央銀行核定後，委託中交兩行代辦。現開交通銀行已核定承貸七千億元，該款將由中央銀行撥交交通銀行發貸。</p>
<h3>人心難以振作　華股疲途徘徊</h3>
<p>華股昨遞交登塲，人心仍難扳作，套利價亦步降，買興大减，除大通及火柴平穩外，均見下游，前途恐非短時間內可能恢復。</p>
<p>最初無甚特變，永紗以一六〇五元及一七二〇元登塲，二一八號買即交，一五七號進遞交，升爲一六二八元及一七四五元。七一號等出遞交，一七六號出即交，又降爲一五八五元及一六八八元。一五七號等來購遞交，二三二號等進即交，掉期軋攏，銀根見鬆，升至一六四二元及一七四五元。終以人心對貼價制度不堪負担，紛紛斬售，交易淸淡，缺少維持，二三五號等了結遞交，二三一號等又賣即交，被迫下游。一八六號亦供即交，近午低至一五五〇元及一六三五元低價。一五七號不時吸納遞交，二〇七號等亦加維持，六九號等買即交，午收升爲一五六〇元及一六六〇元。較前收即交股計信和商務新光永公信誼統益中法國貨新華各跌半成，恒豐小一成，大通微升，餘均微挫。遞交股永紗勸興新光微升，信和小挫，以有貼價負担也。</p>
<p>後市上塲平穩，永紗以一五七〇元及一六五〇元登塲，一〇五號等進遞交，一六號等買即交，升爲一五八八元及一六七〇元。六九號等趁高出即交，一五七號等了結遞交，降爲一五六〇元及一六三八元。九九號等進即交，一三一號等進遞交，回升至一五七五元及一六五三元。一五六號等賣到一五五三元及一六三一元低價，國行差出，九四號等補遞交，六二號等買即交，升至一五七〇元及一六五五元·收市爲一五六〇元及一六三八元。較晨收即交股計閘北永紗統益中絲平平，恒豐信和商務火柴永公麗安新華小升，餘均微挫。遞交股信和平平，餘均微跌。塲外各未上市股票，以文化股跌半成爲最疲，餘亦疲軟。</p>
<p>套利交易，昨以參加　團套利之頭寸擴大，加上多方轉移陣地，貼價步低，合息價貼進者自三角鈿退至二角內，最後約二角一二分。貼價計永紗初開一二〇元，退至七七元，臨收八五元。</p>
<p>內轉賑交易成交數劇增</p>
<p>又訊：若千經紀人，昨爲代客服務起見，試行內轉帳交易，交收代辦費，昨開二八元至三一元，頗受客戶歡迎，嚴格遵守設交規定，全部成交，均在所內作內轉帳。昨日成交數劇增，即交永紗達五六五，三〇〇，〇〇〇股，遞永紗爲五二八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇股，總成交數即交股達一，〇八九，三五四，〇〇〇股，遞交股六二三，四〇〇，〇〇〇股，盛况空前。</p>

<p>外股昨成交稀少，散戶點綴其間而已。怡紗晨開一七〇萬，自一七一萬五退至一六八萬，港電報縮，最後回升至一七三萬左右收市。結果較前收計會德豐微升，航業平平，餘股均告微降。</p>

<h3>中央銀行國庫局　虹口收支處成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央前爲推行加强控制庫款政策起見，自經四聯總處議決通過將各軍政機關現存其他國家行局庫公款悉數移存國行國庫部份辦理後，國行即與各行局庫商定京·滬·平·津·穗·漢六地於三月底辨竣。同時爲便利各軍政機關起見，決於各大都市設立收支處，以應需要。本市國行當局經積極籌備後，已借得北四川路武進路口市銀行虹口辨事處原址設立國庫局虹口收方處，於昨（一日）上午正式開業。據該處宇仟張光亞語記者，該處以人少屋小，且無存鈔庫房，故業務方面擬專辦各軍政機關存匯款項旣經收虹口區一千元以上稅款。將來視各軍政聯關需要，再次第辦理其他業務云。</p>
<h3>房產交易清淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據房地產業中人談：本市房地產租金，自經決定最高額住宅用爲七千倍，營業用爲九千倍後，本市原已稀淡之房地產交易，至此已吿無形凍結。最顯著之現象，莫如房屋項費之普遍騰漲。據估計：約較規定租金最高額前漲起三成至五成之譜。實屋（即住有房客之房屋）之交易，幾吿絕跡。空屋之成交額，亦僅及以前之七成，以交易價値而言，實屋原來之成交値，大致爲該屋時値之三折。其餘之六七成，即無形成爲鉅額之頂費。而目前即貶至時値之二折，亦乏人問津云。</p>
<h3>人絲低　綢貨疲軟</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市開盤即降，下午結果比上日降低七百萬元之譜。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤喊價一億九千二百萬元，中午收盤退至八千九百萬元即期賣出價，隔日期做九千一百萬元，下牛最後價爲八千八百萬元，天橋東洋等均隨之而隊低。</p>
<p>廠經昨市靜寂，行情略軟，高級零擔成交價三億元，中級零擔爲二億九千五百萬元，比上日短去五百萬元之左，實銷極爲淸淡，交易異常稀少。各級五擔單子貨，俱無做開，喊價堅持未動，干經喊價昨亦短五百萬元之譜。　綢貨昨市疲軟，華强眞絲被面，開市在一億一千萬元左右，最小降至一億〇七百五十萬元左右，收市回升至九百萬元即期價。大誠格子璧縐昨做四十二萬元，華錦縐普通貨十五萬元有成交，其他各貨均略呈軟狀。</p>

<h3>戶口米價提高後　食米昨見回升　麵粉貨主扳持較前堅挺</h3>
<p>昨食米南市稍升，北市平定，南市塲雖升而去　實仍平常，故後市轉軟。晨開因二期戶口米高貨價高達三百十萬元，又民食調配會昨未在市上售米，人心因此振作，况迎日下跌甚鉅，貨主乘機扳高價格，較上日加十萬元·　昨米價雖漲，而去路則平淡，本街門銷以戶口米爲主，殊少向市上添補者，故後市略見回疲。北市塲價格殊少變動，僅早稻及特粳稍挺五萬元。昨日到貨南北二市共計六千〇四十五石。</p>
<p>麵粉微升，因速跌已有多日，貨主屢欲挽回頽風，昨乘米價回升之機會，扳持殊力。。晨開最見堅昂，惟客帮尙少納胃，本街以門銷淸閒，取而不多，後稍回落，終略較上日升五千至一萬元。</p>
<p>老車開市曾做一百四十一萬元，收市退爲一百三十九萬五千元，兵船收市一百三十九萬，紅蜂，建成，等一致略升萬元左右。麩皮初定後降，反挫萬五千元，小麥降五萬，廠盤二百萬。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>市少上落，大致轉爲堅穩。黃豆初開平定，旋以客帮有吸，及油價上漲，廠胃亦增，故後市挺五萬元。苞米客帮育口甚少，供過於求，續削五六萬元。菉豆平定，紅糧下疲，芝蔴供求相埒，市呈堅定，生仁價格無甚上落。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>以速降過鉅，昨轉挺升，銀根寬鬆，貸主不急於脫手。况米價上升，各糧跟挺，執戶亦提高價格·生豆油回漲十五至二十萬元，豆油交易殊多，大昌新廠開價爲七百二十萬元，其他廠豆油七百十八及七百二十萬，各漲二十萬元。生油同吿上升，靑島吉桶生油八百五十萬元，計挺十五萬。生菜油漲十五萬，小車蔴油上漲不多，略昂三五萬。豆餅跟油市升二萬，後市較俏。</p>
<h3>蘇州米價略升</h3>

<h3>輸管會辦公費無着　擬徵進口貨手續費</h3>
<p>進出口業尙各方呼籲反對</p>
<p>據輸管會消息：政府預算中對該會經常辦公費用未有列入，致該會經費無着，乃建議行政院當局於進口物資方面徵收千分之一手續費，在進口商申請簽發許可證時附徵，以充該會辦公費用。此項辦法現正由行政院全經會審核中，是否實行，未至決定階段。此訊已獲該會證實，本市進出口業公會聞訊後，極爲重視，並表示反對。因該會經費不應轉嫁進口廠商負祖，實爲巧立名目。又稱我國全年總進口量約爲美金四億元，如征收千分之一，即有四十萬美元，折合國幣達一千億元，進口商對此堅決表示反對云</p>
<h3>捲煙昨疲挫</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，晨開本街添購尙盛，塲內買氣濃郁，行情挺升。旋以利賣傳說又起，人心趨平，同時永泰和開派本外埠同行捲烟，塲內賣風驟起，午後同業中一般頭寸軋緊者，拋售頗多，市氣又形萎靡。最後十支大英及老刀烟，比上日猛瀉五百萬至四百卅萬元，其餘中外各烟，亦均疲憊無神。</p>
<h3>浮多吐售頻仍　紗棉市況萎靡　布疋客銷呆滯成交寥落</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因各方人心未臻安定，客帮納胃趨呆，本街紗商及複製廠進意亦懈，一般浮散多頭又起吐售，因此市價由穩轉疲。</p>
<p>四十二支藍鳳細紗，初開尙站二億大關，旋以檯面帮乘機拋賣，喊價遂吿不支，下降至一億九千萬。迨至近收，浮戶抵補價稍回堅至一億九千二百萬元收市，卒比上日回跌一千一百萬元。</p>
<p>二十一支雙馬紗初開價仍爲一億二千四百萬元，嗣因浮空等拋售，下瀉至一億一千七百萬結束，較上日軋跌七百萬。</p>
<p>其餘二十支十六支十支及四十支三十二支等粗細紗，亦均回挫自四五百萬至六七百萬，及一千三四百萬元不一。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉布市况，以紡建公司又値供售之期，更逢紗價轉疲，客帮進取懈意，一般散戶逢高價吐出，見價低拖進，布商則乘高有吐售，市上交易雖盛，但成交數額不多，行情徘徊疲檔。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初開價爲四百十七萬，嗣以散多等拖納，上升至四百二十七萬高價，旋爲布商等乘高爭會，回低至四百十六萬元收市，與上日軋平，惟藍鷄彩球等細布則較軋挺二，三萬元。其餘嗶嘰直貢及漂布粗布十林布等，平疲互見。</p>

<h3>防癆問題</h3>
<p>— 錢慕韓</p>
<p>沒有討論防癆問題之先，我們必須要知道癆病即結核病的嚴重情形。此病普遍全世界，凡歐美亞洲各文明國此病之生病率及死亡率均較其他傳染病爲高。近年歐美各國因公共衛生之進歩，其死亡率已見大减，而我國則此病仍極流行。現在尙無全國性統計，但據北平上海廣州重慶各處局部調查之結果，其死亡率約爲每十萬人每年死亡三百人。按全國人口計算，則侮年死於此病者達一百餘萬人。按通常結核病每死亡一人即有患者十人計算，則我國每年患此病者約爲一千數百萬人。</p>
<p>此病爲文化病，凡文明國家傳染率極高而城　較鄕間尤盛。據各地調查，我國成年入幾無人能免於傳染者，惟所謂傳染者即謂曾受結核菌之感染並菲每人已患此病之謂也。據賴斗岩醫師於民國廿三年在上海調查之報吿，年齡〇至四歲者其傳染率在城中區爲9.3％在高橋鄉村區爲百分之5.7％。年齡五至九歲在城中區爲百分之53.3％在鄕村區爲百分之32.2％。十至十四歲在城　區爲百分之72.0％在鄉村區爲49.3％十五至十九歲者城中區爲81.8％鄕村區爲63.0％。其傳染之程度與年齡成正比例·結核病可傳染人體內各器官，但極易傳染肺部。其百分數在八十以上·故防癆必須防肺結核病。肪癆的辦法第一是打防癆針，即B．C．G．苗接種·其免疫的原理與打防疫針種牛痘相同。但其免疫功能，只有七與一之比。即未接種者之結核病率爲百分之七，而已接種者之結核病率降爲百分之一。接種B．C．G．苗之先，必須做結核素反應。如反應爲陽性，即表明體內已有結核菌侵入，故不宜接種。第二防癆辦法爲早期診斷，可用小型透視攝影愛克司光機普遍檢查，用費極廉，功作敏捷。早期肺結核病容易治愈。人工氣胸手術效力甚大，即使往院療義費時不多。其急性者注射鏈黴素可能全愈。第三防癆辦法即　格隔離開放性病人。凡痰·糞·　或其他排洩物之含有結核菌者，均須消毒，以免傳染他人，而家庭隔離，尤須注意。第四防癆辨法，即衛生敎育。使一般人均能了解結核病原，傳染途徑之廠重情形，及預防方法。特別是隨便吐痰最爲危險。最近社會賢達募集多金，推動勸止吐痰運動，我們在公共塲所及馬路電燈桿上，可以看到顯明的勸止吐痰標語。造福人羣非淺。此外衛生筷子運動亦同樣重要，尙望社會熱心人士極力提倡，則將來防癆之成績，當可使結核病滅絕也。</p>
<h3>解除麻醉劑嗜好之良法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>據埃及阿勒山特里阿城　Lodinos氏報吿，　會根據M．Vivian氏之方法爲病人戒除麻醉劑嗜好共有八十例。結果均極佳良，値得爲同道介紹，茲特摘譯如下：</p>
<p>據馬帝阿挪氏（Modianos）稱用此種方法戒除嗜好之後，患者即可不再服食麻醉品亦無任何禁斷現象。惟欲使患者不思再犯此種嗜好則不可能（其實仕何良好之戒除嗜好方法亦不能使患者除去其愛好嗜好品之心理）蓋患者雖已戒除嚕好而其愛戀嚕好之心理則不易改鑾，有於戒除嚕好一二年後尙思吸食其嚕好品者也。此外患者常有一種恐懼的心理，以爲戒除之後，身體虛弱，不易對付因體弱而來之各種病症。結果，此種心理鬱積已久，遂釀成眞正之病症而須乞靈於嗜好品矣。據馬氏意見，戒除嚕好之後最好作數月之旅行，其最低限度亦不得於短期內即行回復其原有之生活（例如唱戲者於戒除嗜好之後不能於三個月以內繼讀其唱戲生活），否則極易犯上原來之嗜好。據經驗所得，吸食嚕好品日期愈久者則愈不易戒除云。</p>
<p>此種戒除嗜好方法可以戒除嗎啡，海洛英，可卡因以及酒精等嗜好。其法如下</p>
<p>例如以一個吸食嗎啡之患者爲對象，其每天之吸食總最爲0.3gm吸食年數爲五年。今若爲其戒除嗜好，則第一天於早晨起爲其敷上可使發泡之斑　藥膏三塊於上大腿，每塊藥膏之大小約爲四立方生的，其每塊藥膏之距離不宜太遠，以便包紥時用一塊大紗布己可包住。若腿上生有脚毛甚多者則須爲之剃除。普通在第二天上午已經在每塊藥覆蓋之下發生甚大之水泡（有如被灼後之情形）。此時須於上午十時或十一時左右方可將　膏輕輕揭去以免將水泡揭破。隨即用十西西之注射器裝上較粗之針頭將水泡內之液質抽出，而將針筒內之液體（即病者自身所生之血淸）改用較細之針頭注射於病者臀部肌肉內。若水泡內之血淸於揭去藥膏時因水泡囊已經破損而流出，不易抽取，則可用已經淸毒之玻瑙管接住，再用注射器抽取而注入於病者臀部肌肉內。若血淸內已有沉澱物而不便於注射，則須先將沉澱物抽去方可注射。若水泡內之血淸已經抽去，則須用消毒紗布加上溫和之藥膏如硼酸膏之類，將其包紥，以便保護此處之傷口。若第一次所抽出之血淸不過五西西左右則須於第二天補抽一次，此種製泡及抽漿方法共須舉行三次，每隔三天一次，至於嗎啡方面，在注射血淸之第二天可給以0.7gm之嗎啡而第三天則爲0.12mp第四天0.15gm第五天0.7gm第六天0.06第七天0.03第八天0.015mp自第九天起可以不用嗎啡。在第六夭起除嗎啡之外可用0.06之可代因附加注射。至於可代因份量之多少則以嗎啡减少之數量多少以及病者之需要情形酌定之。若患者有失眠不安以及四肢　痛等等情形則可將0.06之可代因注射三四次。此種可代因注射劑注射於患者之皮下時並無如嗎啡之痛楚，易爲病者所認出。此時須善爲應付，勿爲病者覺察，方爲妥善。蓋可代因之成廳雖無如嗎啡之劇，而病者若或知之，則極易影鄕其心理也。</p>
<p>自第八九天起即可爲病者注射吐根素（此藥對於戒酒者用之尤有奇效）每天注射皮下一次，每次0.03，或0.02gm，約注射七天後，即改爲每隔一天注射一次，在十四天後則改爲每隔二天注射一次。（以後由此類推。）</p>
<p>戒除嗜好時其最須注意者則爲勿令患者知悉醫師每次所用之　爲何名稱。最好於開始療治期間即向患者聲明以後對於醫藥方面之問題恕不奉答，使其死心塌地不再發問。芳於戒除期間發生疲乏　痛等等現象則可爲之注射葡萄糖鈣以及維他命等劑以治之。若禁斷現象（即烟癮現象）發作太劇，則可爲之注射較最後一次注射稍大之嗎啡份量。若嗎啡已减至於零分，則可爲之注射0.02-0.03gm，惟此事當然亦不能告知病者免其心理上發生不幸的變化。至於上述方法以及藥量之使用問題當然因人而異，不可墨守成法。有時在事實上之需要可作第四次之製泡抽漿手術·有時則經過一二次製泡抽漿手術之後即已宿疾全除。總而言之，要在善爲應付而已。</p>
<p>若患者有失眠現象則可令服Chloralbydrat或Paraldehyd之類，必可見效。吾人見患戒除嗜好之後精神煥發食慾增進及能安睡則知其嚕好已經眞正戒除矣。若能於戒嗜好之後令其出門旅行二三個月或則至少令其休養二三月不令立即　續其原有生活則其戒除方有眞正之保證。反之，若病者於戒除嗜好之後又復尋求止痛劑之類則其心理又復動搖，不免有再犯舊疾之危險矣。（原文見一九四七年份之埃及醫刊）</p>
<h3>肺結核之良藥</h3>
<p>— 徐勁</p>
<p>截至目前爲止，所有對於肺結核方面的藥物可以說是還沒絕對的時效藥。近來報章雜誌紛紛提倡的鍊黴素雖則在動物實驗方面已被證實有抑止結核桿菌繁殖的絕對效能，但在臨床試用上還只限於某稱結核症，未能全如人意。兼以鍊黴素之州品稀少，售價高昂而其治療時間又甚長久，非一般病家所能應用。至於鍊黴素對於結核症之臨床實效究竟如何，則一時未有統計，不能貿然評斷。惟據國外醫師的經驗，說是用在粟粒性結核以及結核性腦膜炎甚有功效。從前以爲是絕症者，現在居然有完全治癒之病例，不可謂非喜事。</p>
<p>筆者亦曾親遇一例，爲粟粒性結核症，結果治以鍊黴素而見愈。病者是一個四歲的男孩，突然消搜，茶飯無心。嗣後體溫盤旋而上高熟不退。中醫以爲傷寒而久治不愈。遂請同道倪醫師診治。倪君細騐之下，提議騐血及螢光透視肺部。結果血液檢查並無傷寒反應。X光攝影上則顯出兩肺淺灰色，密佈栗粒。倪醫師斷爲栗粒性結核。持照片與筆者相商·筆者建議以鍊黴素治之並請注意後果。四月以後倪醫師吿我，病者已與其父母去杭州養病。蓋自投以鏈黴棄後，情形良佳，體重顯然增加，熱度漸退。但四月以來，藥物無斷，（鏈黴素打去一百餘瓶），病者起初是獨子，其家屬但願延續其性命，任何高昂之負担都能忍受。然其父母以新又產一兒，病者已失去鍾愛中心，故托言去杭州養病。治病因之中斷。惟以治療前後之X光照片對照，則病勢大有進步。倘無鏈黴素，則病渚也許早亡多時。</p>
<p>但以鏈黴素治療第三期活動性肺癆則大多無效。蓋鏈黴素之作用，據臨牀實驗所知，乃抑止病菌之生長，而非殺死病菌。頃得最新報道，美國政府且已禁止鏈黴出口，因其猶在試驗期中對於人體肺癆並無盛傳的功效。大概對於肺結核之併發症或變症可能有抑止作用，但於人體內之結核桿菌，尙無絕對的功效。至於尿道結核症及腎結核症則已確知其無效云。是以今日鏈黴素之治療範圍大爲縮小，尤未能替代空氣針等之治標方法。一切猶待於專家們之努力也。（未完）</p>
<h3>編者的話</h3>
<p>因爲本報减少篇幅的關係，所以本刊的地位也跟着縮小，這是戡亂建國聲中的必然措施，也是無可奈何的事情。但是，正因爲這麼一來，我們的編輯工作，又大費周章了，因爲要應付局面小的刋物，必須要改換另外一種編輯的方針·同時，我們希望讀者們也用另一種的眼光來看吧！</p>
<p>我們很抱歉，因爲有許多長篇的稿件因爲上述的原因被退回去了。同時，我們也很抱歉，因爲有許多不合於本刋新體裁的稿件不再彼採用了。但願國家早日太平，將來仍舊有以前一樣的篇幅地位吧！</p>
<p>有許多讀者寫信來問各種病症的原因或其療法，只要它叙述詳明及附足郵費和地址，那末我們必定想法給予回覆的。</p>

<h3>義齒</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>我行年五十，口中只剩十七枚牙齒，而且多半動搖了·但我胃口很好，還想在這世問吃些東西。於是校到一位當牙醫師的讀者易昭雪，請他把這十七枚沒用的牙齒拔光，裝了全口的假牙齒，「假」字我　下好聽，就　牠爲「義齒」。自己沒有兒子，養一個螟　子。這兒子稱爲「義子」。自己沒有牙齒，裝一副假牙齒，這牙齒當然也可稱爲「義齒」。</p>
<p>易昭雪牙醫師在十一天內拔光了我口中的十七顆牙齒。我一點也不覺得痛苦，就寫一副四言聯送他：「按進於道，人迭勝天。」上聯已經證實了；下聯是我的希望，尙未證實。過了一個月，我的牙肉收縮了，就去打模型，造義齒。元貝朝晨，我的義齒果然裝上了，整齊潔白，非常美觀。照照鏡看年紀輕了二十歲！</p>
<p>但是，口中很是難過。啣着兩大塊東西，好像是暫時的，常常想把牠們吐出來。舌頭往上一舐，不是自己的肉，而是一塊石版，更不自然，說起話來呢，發音不淸，好像舌頭腫大了。尤其是吃些東西來，嚼不得緊，　緊了上下的牙肉非常之痛。比飯更硬的東西就嚼不動，都是生呑囫圇咽的。有時想練習，吃早粥時硬把一粒花生米交與右邊的臼齒，忍痛用力一嚼，花生米沒有碎，而左邊的臼齒一齊曉起。蹺起之後，口中的粥粒便走進了牙肉與義齒的中間，再嚼的時候痛得更兇。於是只得停止了吃粥，把義齒取下洗；又用水漱過口，然後再裝上去。自從元旦裝上之後，約模一個月之內，我的義齒，只好看而不好用。其間隔一二天必訪問易昭雪一次。因爲牙肉常常作痛，請他修改義齒。這部分修過，果然不痛了；但到了明天，別的部分又作痛，於是再去請他修。自從開始拔牙，直到裝上之後一個月，其間約有八九十天之內，我訪問易昭雪不下數十次。我好比在易昭雪的學校裏當了敎師，隔一二天，坐黃包車去上一次課。從我家到易家，路上的風景，房屋，店舖，都被我看得爛熟。招牌上的字都記熟了·拐角上一家小戶人家的兩個孩子，一男一女，男的大約五歲，女的大約三歲，怪可愛的。我的草子每次從他們門前拉過，我必留意看這兩個孩子。他們有時在玩要；有時在吃番薯；有時小的在哭，大的在駡他；有時兩人在打架都很好看。記得有一次我修牙回來，大的一個不見了，只剩小的一個獨坐在門檻上，撅起小嘴唇發慾。我很懷疑，很　心，想停車問問她：「你的哥哥那裏去了？」「你爲甚麼發愁？」又覺得這太唐突，太多事，太非人情，終於沒有問·但這一天我始終懷疑，始終躭心。直到第二次去修牙時，看見這兩個孩子依舊在一起玩，方才放了心·現在，我的義齒早已得用，不需去修，久不訪問易昭雪了，不知這兩個孩子無恙否。頗想專誠去看一次。但這豈非更唐突，更多事，更非人情麼？不去也罷！</p>
<p>說話走入歧途太遠了！趕快回來說我的義齒。說也奇怪，裝上之後大約一個月，這義齒漸漸變好了。口中全然不覺難過，說話發音很正確，牙肉一點也不滿，東西什麼都可嚼，總之，可以說同「親齒」</p>
<p>一樣了。我仔細體味，變好的原因有兩個：一者，牙肉被石版壓了個把月，壓得皮膚老了，抵抗力也强了。從前我有「親齒」的時候，嚼東西由牙根用力牴抗，牙肉一向不負責的。所以牙肉很嫩，沒有抵抗力，難怪牠初裝的時候吃不消重壓而要作痛的。如今壓慣了，嚼慣了，牠知道此後要牠出力，努力鍛鍊，居然也能成功，從此牙肉代理牙根的職務了。一一者，我裝義齒，好比一向用手指拿東西吃的原始人</p>
<p>一朝用了筷子。起初拿筷的技術很來拙，覺得用這兩根竹棒來取食物，何等隔膜，何等不使！用手指直接去取，何等便利而痛快！但你一定要他用筷，絕不許他用手指。經過訓練之後，他居然也會用慣。到後來，用筷的按術大大進步，可以夾，可以拌，可以拉，可以挑，可以切，可以撕……同手指一樣直接痛快，敏　便利了。我裝義齒，全同這原始人用筷子一樣。初裝的時候這邊用力咀嚼時那邊要蹺起來；吃糯米糰子時義齒要被黏脫；咬瓜子時上下齒對不準；食物的碎層要攢進義齒與牙肉的中間去……都是技術不高明之故·經過一偶月的個　之後，技術高明了，上述的缺憾完全沒有了。易昭學診所　褂着次送他的四言聯『技　於　，人造勝天』。以前　去修牙時，看到下聯四個字很不舒服。我想，「人造」　在不能「勝天」！我　獎了！我於揚得太過分了！我用撤謊替他做廣吿！這是多麼無聊而　爲情的事啊，我着實後悔。但是，前天，我無端去訪他，又看見這副四言聯，我非常高興。我沒　獎他，我沒有撒謊，我的希望果然實現了！前幾天，開明書店的章雪村先生來和我共飲。談起了這副聯，他　　地替我再做一副：</p>
<p>易牙能知味</p>
<p>幇　信多才</p>
<p>我爲這天造地設的五言聯，浮一大白。這比我的四言聯高明得多，確切得多，巧妙得多。易昭雪不妨更名爲易牙。他的診所擴充的時候，我想再把這副五言聯寫了送他。（卅七年三月廿八日於西湖。）</p>
<h3>旅館學校</h3>
<p>— 冷冷</p>
<p>美國北部沿海其州有一所私立職業學校，每年在暑假開始的時候，全校舉行大掃除，所有黑板講台課桌臺凳全部出淸，堆積在地下室：辦公室與敎室油漆粉　，煥然一新，室內佈置精美傢俱，每一問敎室都裝飾成華麗的臥室，不出半個月，一所學校搖身一變爲海濱旅館。</p>
<p>校長身兼經理，敎職員權充司帳與侍應生領班，廚司榮任首席西崽，男女學生都受到短期侍應訓練，全體担任侍應生。</p>
<p>因爲學校地處海濱，盛夏溫度適中，凉風習習，實爲避暑勝地。加以旅館設備俱全——遝動塲，游泳池，圖書館，彈子房與俱樂部應有盡有，侍應周到，房金又廉，所以每年夏季，從各地出發避暑的富紳仕女紛紛光臨，海濱旅館總是門庭若市，高掛客滿牌。</p>
<p>該校旅館營業凈收盈餘全部撥充經費，照章不收學雜費，學生儘可量力自己捐助實物，不限品質多少，即使貧　無力捐助，也可入學。</p>
<p>所以在每學期開學後，收塲總是畜養着牛羊猪等，倉庫堆滿麵紛糖　罐頭食物與旅館日用品。</p>
<p>該校創辦人原係大學出身，年輕時不得意度過侍應生活，中年發跡榮任大飯店絕理，他感覺到職業敎育不切實用，決意撥資創辦該校，務使學識與實用打成一片。不過該校並非專設旅館系一科，尙有其他機械土木等實用課系，另備工塲與測量儀器專供實習。</p>
<p>全校學生大部份都是勞動階級子弟，無論任何一系學生都須輪流値班侍應；其目的在使學生未入社會之前，先與高尙人士接觸，間接學得人情世故，對於將來服務社會裨益匪淺。况且學生大都自尊自愛，盡力本位，頗博旅客好評，其中且有畢業後由以前旅客主顧介紹職業者。學生旣可免費入學，又能獲得竇貴處世經墩，有助於前途職業，豈非一舉二得？</p>
<p>反觀我國學校，大都閉門造車，畢業學生不合社會實際需要，大部份僅能博得一席試用員或練習生，尙須再受特殊受業訓練，其中不乏到處碰壁，賦閒在家者，豈非浪費無數人才時間經濟？</p>
<p>當然，我國物質條件不足，改良敎育談何容易，但願敎育負責當局多多注意，逐步舉　實用職業敎育，則學生幸甚！敎育幸甚！國家幸甚！</p>
<h3>瘦竹治印</h3>
<p>— 西亞</p>
<p>藝術的成就，要先由拘束而奔放，所謂不以規矩不能成方圓是，再由奔放而復歸謹嚴，即所謂功候成熟轉歸平淡是。能　經過這三個階段，就可到超乎凡俗的境界。但是從第一到第二的階段易，而自第二到第三的階段則難　，非下過幾十年的苦學工夫，同時在學問方面旁求進精的，不足與語此。因爲如果只在勸於學習藝事，而不　其他有關的學術，不免手高眼低，其弊非失之俗，必失之　。</p>

<h3>關於結婚科學</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>滬江大學擬於下學期增設「求婚」「結婚」兩科，這消息居然引起了社會人士的注竟和贊同，站在一個滬江學生的立塲上，衷心多少感到些愉快，同時更願意努力促其實現。</p>
<p>首先，我來報道這次滬大敎職員聯誼會對於設立兩科事辯論的經過；</p>
<p>三月十一日的晚上，凌校長夫入主席，宣布討論的問題後，贊成設立「求婚」「結婚」兩科的敎授就發表正面的意見，强調封建制度買賣式婚姻的不合理，然而現代的靑年往往在求偶的時候，或在結婚以後，因爲缺乏合理的指導，以致無一所適從而釀成社會上各種婚姻的慘劇，所以，大學課程除了以訓練「專才」爲目的外，應當注意「通才」的培養，必須有「求婚」與「結婚」兩科，使一般靑年對於他（她）們自己的終身大事，能够得到應有的指導，啓示和認識。</p>
<p>反對設立兩科的敎授以科學與宗敎的觀點，分析人類求偶和結婚，以爲結婚從生物學上看來，只是爲了繁殖生命，綿延種族的一種方式而已；而愛情從宗敎上看來，是由上帝主宰的，非師長可以敎訓的，所以，對於「求婚」和「結婚」之道，結論是不必敎，無法敎，亦沒人敎。</p>
<p>最後，由主席請全體敎職員投票表決，結果以三十四票對十九票，通過應將「求婚」與「結婚」列入課程，而校畏與敎務長都是投的贊成票。</p>
<p>現在，我們認爲値得討論的是：假使這兩科正式設立了，是不是每個學生都是必修的？還是作爲選修課程而屬於那一系？</p>
<p>在我個人以爲不一定要必修，好在事關自己的終身，同學們必會趨之若驚，這樣可免與敎部减輕必修學分的原則相衢突。如果作爲選修學程的話，最好當然還是屬於社會系爲最妥當，因爲這本來是一個社會問題呀！</p>
<p>記得不久前的自由談上，曾刊吳庸先生的「大學社會化」一文，那末，滬江大學的這個新措施，無疑是響應的最好表現，願這種新的敎育能在我國普且遍滋長起來，我們　自己，也爲下一代的學子們祝福。</p>

<p>世界著名作曲家李茲的性格原是很和易近人的，可是在他認爲必要的特候，他便任意幹出極不近人性的事情了。</p>
<p>有一天，一個少年的作曲者把他的「得意之作」送來請敎。李茲看見他的歌詞極爲生硬，曲調也很不和諧，因此指出最糟的一怖，向他說：「這在音樂裏是不可能的。」</p>
<p>「可是，」這少年人傲然的說：「我却辨到了。」</p>
<p>李茲冷笑着，把鋼筆蘸了墨水，然後仟意地向他的外衣上揮洒。「這也是辦得到的，」他說，「可是不應辦。」</p>

<h3>借書</h3>
<p>— 談客</p>
<p>向收藏家借書，確乎常會遇到白眼相向的待遇的，因此對於藏書的人，往往認其爲「吝嗇鬼」，「守書奴」·其實藏書者也有他的苦衷，譬如珍本被掉呀，書頁弄破或弄　呀，……這一切他都顧慮到，這是否屬於過慮，，不必細談，且看一看目前圖書館的書·</p>
<p>你走進去，所看到的大多簿面已很　了，書角捲了·書翻下去，飛頁上會發現某年某月某日某某閱的字樣，字句旁邊已加過綫條。是否圖書館特意去搜集得來的舊書，我不得而知。</p>
<p>我鄉有幾句關於借書還書的話，說：「岡書不宜借，一借就要賴，算你討得快、，　面已撕。」我想這不是過甚其詞的說法。我國雖是禮儀之邦，古聖先哲也留下過許多明訓，若「推己及人」，若「己所不欲，勿施於人」等等，但這些都已成了標語了，談者衆，明者多，而行者鮮。對於公物，尤其存着一種毫不在乎的心理，對別人的東西亦然，眞做到愛護二字的並不多。「弄壞了，大不了賠，有什麼關係？」於是借到一本書，褲袋裏一塞，書角摺皺了，紙張弄軟了，反正沒有破損，圖書館管理員也不說什麼，管他媽的！就這樣，書就從新而舊，而破，而缺了。</p>
<p>然則藏書家的不肯借給書，又怎能苛責他呢？我們的「牌子」做壞了呀！</p>

<h3>Promulgation of Revised National Assembly Organization Law: Presidium of 85 Members; Fourth Preparatory Meeting to Elect Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Order from the National Government: The revised Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law is hereby promulgated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the proposal to revise Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law and expand the National Assembly Presidium's quota, the National Assembly Secretariat rushed the document to the National Government on the afternoon of the 31st. After the Chairman commented, "This Chairman proposes and immediately convenes a temporary State Council meeting to discuss it," the State Council convened a second temporary meeting on the morning of the 1st, presided over by Sun Ke, to discuss the matter. After discussion, it was decided to approve the principle and send it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The Legislative Yuan also held its eighth temporary meeting at 3:00 PM on the 1st and brought it up for discussion. As a result, one word was revised, increasing the number of National Assembly Presidium chairpersons from 25 to 85. During the discussion, the members all believed that the original draft was not drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and listing only 25 people was for fear of obstruction if there were too many people. Now, the opposite is true, so increasing the number of people will facilitate the handling of official business by various units' opinions and provide more political ability and training opportunities. The meeting's opinions also focused on the "mutual election" wording in Article 5 regarding the election method of the Presidium chairperson. The discussions on the number of candidates elected from each unit in the National Assembly preparatory meeting were not considered, and to avoid further disputes over the total number in the National Assembly preparatory meeting, delaying the session, the proposal to not specify the number of people was abandoned. Regarding the number of people, some advocated for 59 people, and some advocated for 99 people. As a result, Deng Hongye's proposal of 85 people received many endorsements, with 48 out of 63 people present voting in favor of its passage. The revised Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law reads as follows: The National Assembly shall establish a Presidium, which shall be composed of 85 members elected by the attending representatives. Its responsibilities are as follows: (1) Matters relating to the rules of procedure; (2) Matters relating to the administrative affairs of the National Assembly; (3) Other matters stipulated in this law. (Other discussion matters of the Legislative Yuan are published on page 2)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold its fourth preparatory meeting on the morning of the 2nd, still chaired by Chairman Yu Bin, to discuss the number of members and election methods of the Assembly Presidium based on the revised National Assembly Organization Law, and to immediately proceed with the election, so that the Assembly can be held as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] News from the National Assembly News Group: A total of 54 representatives registered at the National Assembly registration office on the morning of the 1st. The total number of registrations has now reached 2,164, and there are still 260 representatives en route, who will arrive in Beijing shortly.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Holds Third Preparatory Meeting Yesterday; Representatives' Seats Decided by Drawing Lots; Also Passes Resolution to Pay Attention to "Harmonious Atmosphere in the Venue"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly held its third preparatory meeting at 9:20 AM on the 1st, with 1,687 representatives in attendance, chaired by Chairman Yu Bin. Over the course of the morning, the method for determining the seating arrangement of representatives was revised and approved, and lots were drawn on the spot to determine the order of each unit. The order of the venue was better than the previous two days. More than 30 representatives took the stage to speak, mostly providing written opinions. Border ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese representatives were unanimously given preferential treatment, not participating in the drawing of lots, and were assigned to front-row positions. Elderly representatives with mobility issues and blind representatives were allowed to move to vacant seats of the Presidium chairpersons.</p>
<p>Hong Lanyou, the temporary secretary-general of the preparatory meeting, reported on the principles of the draft method for determining the seating arrangement of representatives drafted by the preparatory committee before the discussion. The general idea was to follow the established rules of the previous National Assembly, advocating for the use of a unit-based arrangement, so that representatives from each unit could easily concentrate on exchanging opinions. During the representatives' speeches, some advocated for following the order of registration, some advocated for adopting a mixed lottery, and some advocated for using both methods in a compromise. The chairman first put the unit system and the mixed system to a vote, and the result was the passage of drawing lots according to the unit system. Furthermore, the draft method stipulates that the order of representatives in each unit is "in the order of registration," which was revised to "determined by drawing lots" after a second vote. However, the five units of Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, border ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese will not participate in the unit lottery, and together with the Presidium, a total of six units will be placed in the front row, which was also agreed to by all representatives. Taiwan originally intended to be included in the border representatives due to language relations, but after the Taiwan representatives expressed that due to the smooth promotion of Mandarin, there were no major problems in terms of language, and they were willing to give up preferential treatment and participate in the lottery, which won applause from the entire venue.</p>
<p>A complete list of unit orders</p>
<p>The unit lottery was held publicly by the chairman and secretary-general after the break. A total of 55 units participated in the lottery, and the results are as follows: 1. Industrial Groups, 2. Jiangsu, 3. Guangdong, 4. Ningxia, 5. Liaoning, 6. Shandong, 7. Hankou, 8. Hunan, 9. Free Professional Groups, 10. Qingdao, 11. Suiyuan, 12. Shanxi, 13. Xing'an, 14. Beiping, 15. Andong, 16. National Women's Groups, 17. Agricultural Groups, 18. Guizhou, 19. Shaanxi, 20. Chongqing, 21. Taiwan, 22. Henan, 23. Qinghai, 24. Liaobei, 25. Commercial Groups, 26. Fujian, 27. Heilongjiang, 28. Jilin, 29. Chahar, 30. Hubei, 31. Sichuan, 32. Shanghai, 33. Xi'an, 34. Guangxi, 35. Dalian, 36. Inland Nationals with Special Living Habits, 37. Zhejiang, 38. Yunnan, 39. Hejiang, 40. Educational Groups, 41. Anhui, 42. Nanjing, 43. Harbin, 44. Fishing Groups, 45. Gansu, 46. Tianjin, 47. Shenyang, 48. Industrial and Mining Groups, 49. Rehe, 50. Hebei, 51. Guangzhou, 52. Jiangxi, 53. Xikang, 54. Songjiang, 55. Nenjiang. The lottery for representatives of each unit will be convened by each unit itself.</p>
<p>No Need to Reserve Seat Number One</p>
<p>During the representatives' speeches, some advocated reserving seat number one for Representative Chiang Kai-shek to show respect. Hong Lanyou then announced that Representative Chiang had not yet registered as of today, and Representative Chiang had stated after being elected that he did not wish to be elected. However, he has now received his certificate of election, and the Assembly has reserved a seat for the Chairman of the National Government on the podium, so there is no need to reserve seat number one for General Chiang. In addition, the meeting also passed temporary motions: (1) The secretariat will publicly announce that representatives can freely donate money to help the Xiaguan refugees. (2) Pay attention to the harmonious atmosphere of the venue. When representatives speak, all representatives should listen patiently and not boo. Yu Bin also, at the request of the representatives, gave a brief report on the signing representative's experience of sending representatives to comfort those on hunger strike yesterday. The meeting adjourned at 11:35 AM.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Discusses the Issue of Signing Elected National Assembly Representatives; No Resolution Reached; Representatives on Hunger Strike for Five Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] During the eighth temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 1st, the issue of signing the names of elected National Assembly representatives was discussed once. Chen Xiaocen and others stated that the hunger strike of the ten representatives was a serious issue, and the resolution to cede to friendly parties was based on the principle of expanding the foundation of the government, but it should also be expanded to the public, and democratic public opinion should not be denied. If attention is paid to the foundation of the party while neglecting the foundation of the public, it would be inappropriate. Therefore, it was advocated to find ways to remedy the situation, so that the signing representatives can be legally elected, and to solve the problem by the Legislative Yuan suggesting that the National Government find a way to resolve it, so that they can be produced from national professional groups to attend the Assembly. Hong Ruizhao appealed to all parties to broaden their horizons, otherwise, if an accident occurs, history will not forgive the stain, leaving regret for eternity. Chen Guyuan and Lin Bin believed that the relevant legal parts must be carefully considered, because even if National Assembly representatives are produced from professional groups, they must have membership in the relevant professional groups and must be elected. It seems difficult to change this through legislative suggestions or executive orders. Zhou Shuyun and others firmly advocated that the Legislative Yuan should pay attention to the legal position and avoid making ineffective involvement in this political dispute, until it was decided to stop the discussion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The issue of signing the names of elected National Assembly representatives remained unresolved on the 1st. At around 3:00 PM, Ma Wenche and Sheng Zizhuang visited Chen Lifu and discussed it for a long time, but no conclusion was reached. Mr. Chen promised to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek after reporting to Hu Shi and others, and then discuss it again. The ten representatives continued their hunger strike on the 1st, which has now reached the fifth day, and their general health is becoming increasingly weak. The National Assembly has asked doctors from the Municipal Hospital to check on their health at any time and inject glucose solution for them. However, except for Yang Qiaoxin, who is old and weak, and Zhang Fu, who has a lung disease, who were persuaded by many people to accept the injection, the rest were unwilling to receive the injection. In addition, Su Mingfang and Yang Shilin, two representatives on hunger strike, have received their certificates of election and went to the National Assembly to register on the 1st, but are still on hunger strike. The signing representatives gathered again on the evening of the 1st, and some advocated asking those on hunger strike to resume eating for three days to wait for the government to resolve the issue, but some opposed it and it was not passed. In the afternoon of the 31st, reporters visited all ten representatives on hunger strike, and they all stated that they were determined to persevere to the end and were unwilling to resume eating until a solution was reached. Throughout the day on the 31st, representatives went to their residences to express their sympathy. President Ju Zheng also personally went to express his sympathy at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The National Assembly also sent representatives Yu Bin, Wu Yun, Hu Dingan, Ding Jiwan, Xu Zinan, and Chen Cunren, accompanied by Hong Lanyou, to express their sympathy. Yu Bin and others advised the ten representatives to prioritize their health and accept a compromise, and to attend the meeting first, but it was not accepted.</p>
<h3>First National Assembly Representatives Organize Associations Separately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The National Assembly representatives from the six national free professional groups of news reporters, lawyers, engineers, accountants, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and physicians had a lunch gathering after the adjournment of the Assembly at noon on the 2nd. At the same time, they held a meeting and publicly elected Feng Youzhen as chairman. The resolutions were: (1) The Free Professional National Assembly Representatives Association will be established today; (2) The Assembly seating order of each unit will be drawn; (3) Liaison officers will be elected from each unit, including (news reporters) Zhao Junhao, Feng Youzhen, Liu Weifeng; (lawyers) Zhang Qieping, Wang Shanxiang, Yu Chunhua; (engineers) Gu Yujing, Xia Guangyu; (accountants) Cai Jinying, He Yuanming; (traditional Chinese medicine practitioners) Lai Shaohun, Ding Jiwan; (physicians) Hua Shujun, Fan Shouyuan. Feng Youzhen was also elected as convener. (4) It was unanimously advocated that at least one person from each unit of the free professional groups should be produced as a candidate for the Assembly Presidium. (5) The office will be located at the Shanghai Central Daily News Beijing office, No. 170 Shandogn Road, Beijing.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The preparatory meeting for the First National Assembly Representatives Association was held on the evening of the 1st, and it was decided to draft the rules and regulations before establishing it on a scheduled basis. In addition, the National Assembly Women Representatives Association is scheduled to be established on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, and Others Host National Assembly Representatives from Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Luo Qinghua and other three people hosted National Industrial and Commercial National Assembly representatives on the 1st. Xu Jiguang, Qian Xinzi, Wang Xiaolan, Wu Yun, Pan Shihao, Zhao Dihua, Pan Yangshan, Chen Qiye, and dozens of others attended. Mr. Pan gave a speech on the spot, saying that the foundation of democratic politics should be built on a sound foundation of industry and commerce. Now that people from the industrial and commercial sectors are participating in the National Assembly, they should contribute more opinions.

<h3>National Assembly Chronicle: Scrambling to Argue About Seating</h3>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper (Nanjing, April 1st)</p>
<p>Democratic politics is about respecting dissent, seeking common ground, and the expression of public opinion is precisely valuable because there are differences. The preparatory meetings of the National Assembly for the past three days have been full of contention, shouting, and even chaos, which shows that it represents public opinion and also proves that it is indeed a democratic institution. Therefore, until now, I am afraid that except for the election of Chairman Chiang as President, which will not be disputed, any resolution will inevitably involve debate and quarrels. In the preparatory meetings of the previous two days, there was a dispute for two days over the number of members of the Assembly Presidium, making an article of counter-proposal to the Legislative Yuan. On the morning of the 1st, there was also a heated debate over the method of determining the seating arrangement. In the huge Assembly Hall, reporters and constituent representatives saw Mei Lanfang's play two years ago. If you sit in the upstairs or downstairs back row, you can't see or hear clearly. Who wouldn't want to sit in the downstairs front row? The seats in the National Assembly Hall are not sold for tickets, and there is no difference in ticket prices, but for the necessity of deliberation, you have to sit according to the seat number, and everyone wants to sit in a better position, so it is inevitable to scramble for a seat. The secretariat of the preparatory committee also anticipated this point, and followed the practice of the Constituent National Assembly to entrust the solution of this problem to fate or opportunity. According to Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, this method of arranging seats in Taiyuan City has precedents, and there will be no special problems. Temporary Chairman Yu Bin, who escaped the previous day, also thought it would be passed quietly and calmly took the stage. Although Secretary-General Hong's golden voice is a bit hoarse, the sound waves of his speech and the coherence of his narration are still clear. After he reported on the draft of the method for determining the seating arrangement of representatives, the representatives began to express their opinions. So opinions were raised and lowered, more and more opinions, and the order became more and more chaotic. Fortunately, Yu Bin's voice was loud and his handling was effective. With the assistance of Hong Lanyou, he sorted out the clues from the chaos, one by one clearly, and a one-third resolution was only made on the mornings of the 30th and 31st, while a complete case was passed on the morning of the 1st, and the efficiency of the National Assembly's deliberations has also increased. The first speaker was Deng Zhunamu, a Tibetan female representative from Xikang. She said that they should sit in a mixed order according to the order of registration, because it is not easy for everyone to meet. In this way, they can get to know more people, communicate understanding between compatriots in various places, especially with border compatriots, and increase unity, so they are not afraid of the instigation of ambitious people. If this is not possible, it is not easy for border compatriots to come to Beijing, and they do not understand the language, so they should sit in the front. Originally, Representative Deng's registration order was number four, and she was a Tibetan, so whether it was backwards or forwards, she had to find a way to sit in the front. Another opinion was to agree to draw lots by unit to determine the seating arrangement, but the seat order of individual representatives in each unit should not follow the registration order, but should also draw lots to be fair. Otherwise, everyone will have to rush to register before the meeting in the future, how can this be allowed? This opinion was raised by Representative Rui Jin from Taiyuan City, registration order number 1256. He registered late, so he had to have the opportunity to rush to the front. The third opinion was proposed by Representative Liu Cui, number 496, to draw lots by individual representative to determine the seating arrangement of the entire venue. He said that representatives from each unit can contact and communicate outside the venue, but they should not be separated into their own worlds in the venue, with clear divisions. He completely advocated a big mix. In addition to these three main opinions, some people also advocated equal opportunities, rotating straight and horizontal rows. Naturally, these opinions also had opposing opinions. Yu Bin then declared: "To summarize everyone's opinions, the main ones are the unit system and the mixed system. The mixed system is very good. This National Assembly is not only about building the Republic of China, but also about meeting the goal of advancing towards a great community." He announced with a smile that he would vote on the amendments first according to the law. Representatives who favored the mixed system pressed the button, and colorful stars appeared everywhere on the voting machine, but the number of representatives present was 1933, and the number of those who favored it was 806, a minority, and the mixed system opinion was rejected.</p>
<p>Discuss the original draft one by one, Article 1 and Article 2 were passed without objection, but Article 3 encountered a storm again. Tibetan, Mongolian, and border compatriots and overseas Chinese wanted to fight for the old rights to sit in the front, and some people thought of respecting Chairman Chiang and caring for elderly and disabled representatives, while others cared about the Mandarin of the Taiwan representatives, and positions should also be reserved for them in the front. Amidst the diverse opinions, one representative shouted: "The Communist bandits in North China and Northeast China are making such a fuss, what have we resolved in three days of meetings? Border representatives and overseas Chinese representatives are also Chinese, what reason is there to be special? We must treat everyone equally and vote to pass the original draft!" In a chorus of boos, under the arm-waving opposition of the Xinjiang representative who understood Mandarin, the chairman repeatedly shouted "Stop speaking, stop speaking."</p>
<p>So, the meeting passed Rui Jin's proposal to amend Article 3, Section 3 by a majority of 1121 votes, and then passed Article 4 without objection, before turning back to continue to defeat these problems of wanting to sit in the front one by one. Chairman Chiang has a position on the stage, and elderly and disabled representatives can sit in the vacant positions of the rotating chairmen on the stage. The Tibetan, Mongolian, and border compatriots and overseas Chinese sit in the front on both sides, while the Taiwan representatives admitted that there was no problem with Mandarin and did not want to rush to the front, thanking everyone for their concern. Then Yu Bin said: "The unit lottery will be held on the spot, let me and Secretary-General Hong perform a duet!" Yu Bin sang the province names, and Hong Lanyou sang the numbers. As a result of the drawing of lots, those in the front applauded, and those in the back smiled silently, scrambling to be first, doing their best, and listening to fate.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Voting Machine to be Officially Tested</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Assembly Hall is the only place in the country equipped with a voting machine. It was used during the previous Constitutional National Assembly. The current National Assembly has already held three preparatory meetings, and some representatives have expressed doubts about this machine. On the 1st, a representative even requested an inspection. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou responded tactfully, saying that any representative who wishes to see the voting machine is welcome to visit at any time, half an hour before the daily meeting. A formal test will be held on the day of the assembly to dispel any doubts.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Issue of Issuing Short-Term Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of issuing short-term treasury bills, opinions vary greatly; some strongly advocate for it, while others express deep skepticism. We believe that the answer to this question should be based on the purpose of issuing the treasury bills.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the issuance of short-term treasury bills serves two main purposes: one is financial, where the treasury occasionally feels short due to seasonal factors, and issues these short-term bonds to make adjustments. Hence the name "treasury bills," and they are redeemed once the treasury's income is more abundant. The other is monetary, where treasury bills are issued judiciously to regulate the market when there is an overabundance of money and too much capital. The difference between them and government bonds is that the former are temporary, while the latter are relatively long-term. Compared to banknotes, the difference lies in the redemption period, with one having interest and a discount, and the other having neither. Therefore, from a purely financial point of view, issuing more banknotes is more advantageous.</p>
<p>Now, with the currency inflated too much, it is inconvenient to issue more banknotes. Instead, short-term treasury bills are issued and used as a means to recover a portion of the banknotes. This inevitably increases the burden on the treasury, but the intention is certainly justifiable. Those who support this policy are focusing on this point. There is indeed too much floating capital in the market right now. Phenomena such as soaring prices, rampant speculation, and the hardship of the people's livelihood and economic decline are all rooted in this. Yet there are no other practical countermeasures to absorb floating capital and tighten credit. Therefore, we naturally hope that the issuance of short-term treasury bills will proceed smoothly and achieve the expected effect.</p>
<p>However, issuing treasury bills is one thing, and whether they can absorb floating capital and achieve the expected effect is another. Although treasury bills and legal tender are different in form and nature, they are both freely circulating capital. Moreover, their unit is particularly large and the turnover is very fast. If the financial aspect is too strong and the issuance technique is slightly careless, they could very likely transform into a huge amount of legal tender, which will increase the amount of floating capital instead.</p>
<p>The regulations for the issuance of these treasury bills have not yet been announced. The amount of issuance and discount rate have no fixed rules. Everything is entrusted to the Central Bank to handle at its discretion in the open market, according to actual needs. We hope that the Central Bank will carefully consider and handle the public issuance prudently, so as to achieve the point of absorbing a part of the floating capital; even if we take a step back, we must not issue too much, which will increase the floating capital and deepen the malignant nature of currency inflation.</p>
<p>Now the market interest rate is as high as 30-40%, and in order to ensure the smooth issuance of treasury bills, we have to increase the discount to arouse the interest of the general public. Therefore, when the first batch of treasury bills matures, we have to issue more than the first batch to cope with it. In this case, more and more treasury bills will be issued, floating capital will increase day by day, and the national treasury's burden will also continue to increase. Many people are worried that the future results may not be good. The reason is on the left. For the sake of the credit of treasury bills, we would like to put forward a few suggestions: First, when the first batch of treasury bills expires, it should not be completely dependent on the reissuance of new treasury bills, at least a part of it must be supplemented by other financial resources; second, the amount of issuance should not be too large, nor should it be issued too quickly. It must be determined according to actual needs. In addition, there is one more point that seems worth mentioning, that is, the issuance of treasury bills is entrusted to the Central Bank for public handling, so it will not repeat the past mistakes of arbitrary allocation, but the old practice of bundling issuance must also be avoided as much as possible to refresh the ears and eyes of the general public. The minimum amount of this treasury bill is set at 10 million yuan. Because the amount is too large, it is not suitable for the distribution of all salaries. What is worrying is that the amount of various loans is huge and the need is particularly urgent. In the past, there were often cases where there was too little capital and it was too slow to solve the urgent need. We believe that other methods should still be found for these needs, and treasury bills should not be used to offset them, which would lose their original meaning.</p>
<p>In short, when issuing treasury bills, we should first recognize the goal clearly, and then identify the goal. If the goal is to absorb floating capital, then we should take this as the goal from beginning to end, and not make mistakes or get lost. Under this circumstance, all Chinese people should support the issuance of short-term treasury bills.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Temporary Meeting Discusses the Draft Treasury Bill Regulations, Finally Decides to Re-Submit for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Legislative Yuan held a temporary meeting on the 1st to discuss the draft "Regulations on Short-Term Treasury Bills of the Republic of China in the Thirty-Seventh Year." The draft was prepared by the Central Bank, which accepted the Four Banks Joint Secretariat's loan policy proposal for the 37th year and entrusted the bank to issue treasury notes in accordance with the market interest rate. It was sent to the Ministry of Finance on March 3, forwarded to the Executive Yuan on the 24th, approved, presented to the National Government on the 25th, and passed by the State Council on the 26th, and handed over to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. After being reviewed and revised by the Finance Committee on the 1st, it was submitted to the temporary meeting in the afternoon of the same day. The main points of the draft regulations are: the government authorizes the Central Bank to issue three types of short-term treasury bills with a duration of one month, two months, and three months. The face values are 10 million yuan, 50 million yuan, 100 million yuan, 500 million yuan, and 1 billion yuan. All are bearer bonds, with a monthly interest rate of 5%, and the principal and interest are paid together upon maturity. The amount of issuance is based on the actual sales amount and is not limited. The Central Bank may also increase or discount the issuance or repurchase the bonds early depending on the supply and demand of funds in the market. After Chen Changwu explained the review and modification process of this draft, Sun Jiulu, Liu Tong, Chen Zifeng, Hong Ruizhao and others spoke out in opposition, all of whom believed that the goal set by the first article of the draft, to "stabilize finance, absorb floating capital, and stabilize currency value" through this type of treasury bills, was too high. Sun Jiulu also cited the example of American treasury bills and government bonds, believing that the legal profit was far less than the unofficial interest rate. If the credit of legal tender cannot be maintained, the result will be fruitless. Hong Ruizhao pointed out that the effect of treasury bills is doubtful, but making the issuance of treasury bills become a competition between the government and merchants to speculate, insulting the political atmosphere, and causing disadvantages due to the uncertainty of appreciation and depreciation, is easy. Finally, it was decided to re-submit for review.</p>

<h3>Female Magistrate Xu Fangyuan Initially Shows Her Talent in Xifeng</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guiyang March 28th Airmail] On the eve of the National Assembly meeting, the Guizhou Provincial Government, following the instructions of the highest authorities and based on local public opinion, is making every effort to open up the government, not only allowing the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to conduct open activities in Guizhou, the sacred ground of the Kuomintang, but also selecting outstanding women with extraordinary talents to participate in the government, in order to meet the actual requirements of democratic politics. The appointment of Ms. Xu Fangyuan as the acting magistrate of Xifeng County, a transportation hub and scenic area of the province, at the provincial government meeting on the 27th of this month, is the best news that touches people's hearts.</p>
<p>Not Yet 30 Years Old, Elegant Demeanor</p>
<p>Ms. Xu is not unknown to the people, regardless of gender or age. She is less than 30 years old, has an elegant demeanor, is refined and courteous. She graduated from the Provincial No. 1 Women's Normal School and the Department of Education of Jinling Women's University. She is also an alumna of the Chinese Teachers' Association of Central University. She has served as a lecturer at Guiyang Provincial No. 1 Women's Normal School, a teacher at a girls' middle school, and was transferred from the Guizhou Provincial Government Directly Under the District to work. Of course, like ordinary women who enjoy sports, she has been calling on women to participate in social activities since her middle school days. Later, she gradually rose in rank and served as a member and executive director of the Provincial Women's Movement Committee, the chief executive of the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, a member of the Guiyang City Provisional Council, a standing supervisor of the Guiyang City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and a supervisor of the Guizhou Provincial Party Headquarters. She also co-founded the "Great Wind Monthly" with her Jinling Women's University classmate Zhu Jianfen. She is currently the chairman of the Guiyang City Women's Association, a senator of the Guiyang City Council, and a director of the Guizhou Provincial Women's Association. After marriage, she became the wife of Sun Botao, the deputy general manager of the Guizhou Provincial Bank.</p>
<p>Confident and Articulating Aspirations</p>
<p>On the 26th, when her appointment as magistrate was announced, reporters searched everywhere for her to conduct an interview. Being the most active woman in Guiyang City, it was truly difficult to track her down. Finally, the hospitable reporter met her at a friend's place and asked her what political plans she had for managing Xifeng. She responded with a concise and capable attitude, saying that she had long been prepared for this task. She told me that she would definitely emphasize autonomous governance, especially in the past three or four years, she had been engaged in mass movement work and had gained experience and insights into local self-government. This time, the provincial government had recognized her past performance and her previous insights into local governance when they promoted her to this position. She would conduct a thorough investigation and research and regarded this task as an opportunity to serve the public. She did not have any special views, but she would follow the Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang's Five-Year Plan for New Guizhou as her guide for governing. She hoped to be able to mobilize the power of the people and strive for construction and progress in the rare stable environment, so that the Guizhou women who served as magistrates would not start with her and then have no successors.</p>
<p>Hard Work and Struggle for Five or Six Years</p>
<p>This female magistrate's ambition is indeed not small, which stems from her political foresight. Because to mobilize women, one must understand the psychology of the masses, be able to manipulate the arena, and be good at competitive elections. Ms. Xu has been diligently practicing these skills for the past five or six years. The women's movement in Guizhou Province, especially in Guiyang City, is led by Ms. Xu and her sister, and the City Women's Association they lead, along with the Provincial Women's Association led by Chen, have the strength to rival each other. Magistrate Xu has been engaged in women's elections for many years, and she is able to work hard and practically. Her brother-in-law is also in charge of national education, which provides her with considerable assistance.</p>
<p>Competing for Legislative Seats, Retreating as a Strategy</p>
<p>Six months ago, Magistrate Xu was campaigning for a Kuomintang nomination for a Legislative Yuan seat, but she could not overcome her political opponents. For a moment, she felt disheartened and suddenly published a statement of resignation in the Guizhou Daily, which surprised many political figures. This move, which she thought was clever, did not win her the nomination. At that time, she was very angry and uneasy. When the central government announced the list of legislative candidates, Magistrate Xu's name was not on the list. So she repeatedly gathered individuals with the same fate, plus three to five hundred women, to petition the Provincial Council, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Election Office, in order to avoid losing all her years of effort. In the end, due to legal restrictions, her wishes were not fulfilled. When it came to the legislative elections, Ms. Xu clearly distinguished between gratitude and resentment. With a determined heart, she simply gave the vast majority of votes she had already secured to Ms. Yang Yiru, a women's legislative candidate from the Democratic Socialist Party, determined to make those who wanted to control the votes end up with nothing. Political struggles are devoid of emotion, but women are ultimately fragile and inevitably susceptible to emotional impulses. On the day of the legislative elections, the Guiyang City press wanted to see the good show of the ladies competing for votes, and they absolutely did not let go of Ms. Xu's polling station. That day, moved by the scene, the vote she cast was the three large characters: "Yang Yiru."</p>
<p>Seizing Opportunities and Displaying Ambitions</p>
<p>This is not surprising. After the fact, the more she thought about it, the more unwilling she became. She thought of the "Official Cannon" in Chengdu, who could repeatedly accuse the mayor and thus become famous throughout the country. Since she had suffered such a great injustice, why not take the example of the official and do the same? Ms. Xu filed a complaint with the High Court against the Provincial Election Office for violating the law, causing the Provincial Election Office to work day and night to rush out a reply document, busily without stopping.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu is physically strong and full of energy. Participating in practical politics this time is exactly the excellent opportunity she should seize. Xifeng is a scenic area, only 73 kilometers from Guiyang City. Let's wait and see how she goes there to display all her ambitions.</p>
<h3>Case of Bullying Elderly Nun in Lanzhou: Senator Wang Zhongying Becomes Target of Public Anger; Professional Groups to Cast Recall Votes According to Law</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Lanzhou 31st Dispatch] Lanzhou City Councilor Wang Zhongying, representing independent professional groups, was accused of bullying a vulnerable elderly nun last year and openly obstructing freedom of the press, leading to dissatisfaction among members of various independent professional groups, who jointly requested his recall. Since the law on recalling city councilors had not yet been promulgated, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Interior for instructions. It is now learned that the Ministry of Interior has sent a reply telegram stating: "Before the implementation measures for the recall of city councilors are promulgated by the Executive Yuan, in addition to submitting a petition for recall signed by one-twentieth of the voters in the electoral district or one-tenth or more of the members of the original group, a referendum should also be held. The recall shall be considered passed if more than half of the total votes cast are in favor. As for the voting method, the anonymous voting method shall be used." Lanzhou reporters and the Chinese and Western Medical Association will cast recall votes according to legal procedures after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Cable from Shanghai to the U.S. Congress</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In late March, Shanghai City Council Speaker Pan, concerned about the serious situation, repeatedly invited leaders from all walks of life to gather and discuss. As a result, in addition to mobilizing influential people in society to make suggestions to the government to reform various facilities, he also sent a cable to the U.S. Congress, respectfully requesting continued advocacy for aid to China to quell the Communist bandit rebellion. This cable was published in local English newspapers yesterday. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Honorable Vandenberg, Speaker of the Senate, Barkley, Democratic Leader, Martin, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Honorable Rayburn, Democratic Leader, Eaton, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and all members of the Congress:</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to President Truman and to you all for your warm sympathy for our country as demonstrated by the $570,000,000 aid-to-China bill proposed by President Truman on February 18, which provides that a portion of the funds specified in the original bill should be allocated for military assistance, as resolved by the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress. Now that your Senate and House of Representatives are about to begin discussing the bill, we, representing the popular representative bodies, universities, rural areas, cultural, commercial, economic, and financial organizations of our country, feel compelled to state to you:</p>
<p>The rebellion of the Chinese Communists has its powerful international background. It is not merely an internal problem of our country, but a part of the world problem, namely the struggle between totalitarianism and democracy. Therefore, our two countries, China and the United States, are now fighting for a common mission, namely the peace and security of the world. Now the Communists are rampant in the Northeast and North China, and the economic situation in the enemy-occupied areas is also deteriorating. The situation has reached a critical point. Any assistance, if it is too small or too late, will not help the overall plan. We urgently request your attention: The seriousness of the situation in our country is no less than that in Europe, and the urgency of aid to China is also no less than that of aid to Europe. Therefore, we deeply hope that your Congress will pass the aid-to-China bill in the fastest possible way, and expand its scope and amount, so that all aspects of military, financial, and economic affairs can be taken care of. We will also fulfill our duties and jointly urge the government with the people of the whole country to implement reforms in politics, military affairs, finance, and economy in order to meet the requirements of our people, so that the good intentions and money of your people will not be wasted.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council; Wen Zhao, President of Aurora University; Cheng Dafang, President of the Chinese Foreign Policy Association and former Ambassador to Germany; Hu Dunfu, President of Datong University; Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University; Zhu Jingnong, President of Guanghua University; Ou Yuanhuai, President of Great China University; Xu Xinyu, Executive Director of the China Rural Service Society, General Director of the Experts' Weekend Symposium; Xu Jiqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Du Yuesheng, President of the Shanghai Local Association; Zhao Dihua, Standing Director of the National Bank Federation and General Manager of the Bank of Communications; Lai Lian, former President of National Northwest University; Tang Yanyi, Chairman of the Department of Mathematics of National Jiaotong University; Zhao Chuanshou, former Secretary of the Board of Directors of the Sino-American Education and Culture Foundation; Liu Tuo, former Dean of the School of Science of National Northwest Associated University and General Manager of the China Sugar Refinery, and others.</p>
<h3>Su Bei Big Traitor Chen Tong Arrested; Victimized People Rise Up to Report Him</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 1st Dispatch] Chen Tong, a major military traitor in northern Jiangsu, was a native of Siyang, Jiangsu. In the early stage of the War of Resistance, he served as the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Independent Regiment of the 89th Army of the National Army. In the autumn of 1940, he willingly recognized the enemy as his father and led his troops to surrender to the enemy, serving in the puppet army as deputy commander of the 28th Division. He was stationed in Huaiying, Sishui, and Xingcheng, killing innocent people, plundering the people, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. He also flattered the enemy chiefs and plotted to destroy our National Army in Huaidong, Xinghua, luring the National Army to surrender to the puppet regime. After the Japanese surrender, the traitor fled to Shanghai. He was finally arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command a few days ago because his evil deeds were full. The people of northern Jiangsu who were victimized, after hearing the news, have risen up to report him.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Suddenly Implements Strict Controls; Traffic Between East and West Berlin Blocked; British, American, and French Occupation Authorities Lodge Serious Protests</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] A British military train, under the protection of a guard ordered to forcibly prevent anyone from boarding, left Berlin hours before the Soviet Union suddenly announced the implementation of stricter restrictions on traffic across the East-West border. Britain had previously declared its refusal of the Soviet authorities' new restrictions, followed by France, and the United States announced that it would make the same representation. The new measures promulgated by the Soviet authorities were notified to the three Western occupying powers 24 hours earlier, stipulating that all persons, whether military or civilian, entering the Western sector from the Soviet sector must hold a transit passport, and all cargo must first be inspected by the Soviets at the border of the sector outside Berlin City. The Soviet notification of tightened border controls was delivered to the three Western occupying powers on the night of the 31st by Soviet Deputy Military Governor-General Lieutenant General Tratvenov. Previously, the British authorities had asked the Soviet authorities to postpone the implementation of the new measures for 15 days so that the three Western authorities could discuss the matter with Soviet representatives. After the Soviet authorities notified their decision to implement the measures as scheduled, Lieutenant General Browne, Chief of Staff of the British Military Headquarters, sent a letter to the Soviet side, stating that Britain refused to allow Soviet personnel to inspect cargo and Allied personnel to have transit passports. Major General Noiret, Deputy Military Governor of the French Military Government, also sent a letter to Lieutenant General Tratvenov, rejecting the Soviet Union's new border control measures, and declaring that these measures must be decided on a four-power basis. According to the German Post, which is registered with the French authorities in Berlin, the residents of several small villages on both sides of the highway near Materberg, the land traffic channel connecting Berlin to the Western occupied areas, have been ordered to move by the Soviet authorities, indicating that the Soviet military authorities are preparing to build barracks for border troops and German border guards to strengthen border control.</p>
<p>[United Press Berlin 1st Dispatch] The Soviet Union cut off land contact between Western countries and Berlin on the 1st. At the same time, Moscow Radio announced that the disintegration of Germany was a "fait accompli."</p>
<p>"Pravda" claimed that the British and Americans may protest the isolation of Berlin through the Allied Control Council, which "in fact is no longer the supreme body for the four-power joint administration of Germany." The Soviets insisted that they had the right to inspect vehicles heading to the British, American, and French sectors of Berlin, and cut off traffic from Berlin to the west.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] Political figures in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union's tightening of traffic controls is likely the first step for the Soviet Union to force the Allies to withdraw from Berlin. People close to the Soviet military government also said that the Soviet Union is determined to implement these new measures to the end, and they have also drafted plans to deal with the situation caused by the Western countries' refusal to comply.</p>
<h3>British and American Military Vehicles Blocked; U.S. Switches to Air Transport</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] The U.S. Military Government in Berlin announced on the morning of the 1st that it has cancelled military trains in and out of Berlin and switched to air transport. Special air services will be added from Frankfurt in the U.S. occupied zone to the Tempelhof Airport controlled by the U.S. military in Berlin. After the Soviet-announced restrictions on transit came into effect at midnight on the 31st, the first U.S. military train leaving Berlin was detained at the Marienfelde station for 30 minutes for inspection by Soviet personnel before continuing westward. Later, a U.S. military train from Bremerhaven to Berlin and a U.S. military express train from Frankfurt to Berlin were blocked and returned because the U.S. military officers accompanying the train refused to allow Soviet personnel to board for inspection. Two British military trains detained by the Soviet Union at the Marienfelde station have not yet been heard from. The British military trains were detained because the British officers in charge accompanying the train, according to instructions from their superiors, did not allow Soviet personnel to board for inspection. The British military government has lodged a protest with the Soviet authorities regarding this matter. The U.S. and France are expected to lodge similar protests with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin 1st Dispatch] According to the German News Agency, refugees from Brunswick said that the number of Soviet border guards at the border between the British and Soviet occupied zones has greatly increased in recent days. They also said that, except for some fixed points in time, the border will soon be closed, and those who cross the border illegally will be killed.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Finnish Treaty Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>[Reuters Helsinki 1st Dispatch] It is learned that the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty negotiations have stalled due to Finland's insistence that the Soviet Union may not provide military assistance to Finland unless specifically requested by Finland.

It is learned that the points insisted upon by the Finnish delegation include: (1) Finland must decide for itself when it is threatened by war; (2) the military part of the Soviet-Finnish treaty shall only apply in the event of war; (3) the treaty shall be valid for ten years, not twenty years as suggested by Stalin; (4) the exchange of views between the signatory states on important international issues concerning the interests of both parties shall be strictly limited in the Soviet-Finnish treaty.</p>

<h3>Draper Report to Be Released in U.S.</h3>
<p>Most Employees of Japanese Government Agencies Have Resumed Work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 1st Dispatch] Johnston, chairman of the Draper Mission, pointed out at a banquet of the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Tokyo today that Japan has been completely disarmed in terms of materials, its shipping has been completely destroyed, and its industry is also incomplete, so it cannot prepare for war for at least fifty years. The recommendations or reports of the representatives will be submitted to the US government first. He admitted that the delegation had no "magic formula," but that the members of the delegation were all experienced senior business people and had conducted two weeks of careful research in Japan. Draper said that the lack of a basis for concluding a peace treaty between Japan and Germany is one of the basic reasons hindering the country's economic recovery.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 1st Dispatch] Although Marquis, the head of the Economic and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, issued an order yesterday prohibiting all organized regional strikes in Japan, sporadic strikers continued to strike today.

<h3>Spain's Participation in the Reconstruction Plan: No Mention in US Congressional Committees, Everything Awaits Western European Nations' Own Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] New York One-Day Broadcast: Washington News, the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives decided not to mention Spain's participation in the European Recovery Program (ERP), leaving it entirely to the sixteen European countries to decide on their own.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] New York One-Day Broadcast: Washington News, White House Press Secretary Ross declared that President Truman deeply opposed the House's passage of the section "Welcoming Spain's Participation in the European Recovery Program," believing that it would certainly be removed during the Senate and House's adjustment of the foreign aid bill.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, One-Day Dispatch] Before the US House of Representatives passed the amendment to the foreign aid bill, Democratic Congressman Douglas requested a re-vote on Congressman O'Konski's amendment to include Spain in the European Recovery Program. The result of the vote was that the motion passed again with a majority of 188 votes to 104.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bogotá, 31st Dispatch] This agency has learned from authoritative sources that Secretary of State Marshall has instructed the State Department to use various methods to prevent Spain from being included in the House of Representatives' American aid to Europe plan. Marshall is most concerned about the impact on the Italian people if Spain, labeled as a fascist country, is included in the aid to Europe. It is reported that Marshall is maintaining contact with Acting Secretary of State Lovett in Washington, DC, and it is expected that the State Department will soon formally announce Marshall's views on this matter, and if necessary, Marshall himself will issue a statement here to counter the communist propaganda that uses the Spanish issue as an excuse.</p>

<p>(6) Friction Caused by Stilwell</p>
<p>In 1944, when the Sino-American wartime alliance reached its lowest point, General Stilwell, the commander of the US forces in the China-Burma-India Theater, considered withdrawing the US Fourteenth Air Force from China. I am not prepared to say whether he had formally proposed this to the US War Department or whether he merely used it as one of Stilwell's last threats to Chongqing. Only the archives of the theater or the testimony of those who participated in the final negotiations before Stilwell was recalled in 1944 can fully reveal the details. In my opinion, this is an example of Stilwell taking various steps to expand his power in China, completely disregarding its possible impact. Given the deteriorating situation in China at the time, such an action, or even threatening such an action, would have caused complete chaos if the threat had been made public. At that time, the Fourteenth Air Force was the only effective military force in China that enjoyed public trust.</p>
<p>Regardless of how drastic this approach was, there was indeed a desire at the time to draw the attention of the Chinese authorities to this matter. The first time I learned about this was when the Chinese privately inquired of me, hoping to know whether this plan would be implemented. The theater command did not provide me with any information on this issue. Now, in retrospect, I think of the sharp reduction in the tonnage of goods transported by the Fourteenth Air Force over The Hump, and the significant reduction in the goods handed over to the Chinese authorities. In my opinion, this reduction was another way for Stilwell to exert pressure on Chongqing, in addition to the actual withdrawal of the air force. In the autumn of 1943, a year before Stilwell was finally recalled, a friction occurred between the theater commander and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the severity of which was almost similar to the situation that later forced Stilwell to leave China. In fact, there was almost a demand to remove him from his post.</p>
<p>At that time, Stilwell had been assured by Madame Chiang Kai-shek that he would from then on obey the will and instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. I witnessed part of the situation. This assurance seemed to have been given after some conversation.</p>
<p>When I left this meeting, Madame Chiang Kai-shek's sister, Madame Kung, pulled me aside and told me, somewhat strangely, "General Stilwell has agreed to obey Chairman Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>Even today, I still don't understand the origin of this strange assurance, but I am sure that even if Stilwell wanted to maintain the best relationship with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as the US military theater commander, he failed to make himself conform to his will in all aspects. So I assume that he made this promise without intending to keep it. It should be pointed out that their most intense disputes over the Burma campaign began immediately after the Cairo Conference in November 1943.</p>
<p>Based on my experience with the central government, I have found that friendly frankness is the only prerequisite for satisfactorily resolving mutual problems. For Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, I never found it necessary to conceal the truth, no matter how unpleasant the truth was. I always told him the facts as I saw them, and if the situation required corrective measures, those measures would come. Needless to say, when submitting critical reports, the position of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as the most influential and decisive figure in China, should be given due respect—but not to the point of kowtowing. In other words, friendly and effective relations only require an attitude of self-respect and respect for others that is due to the head of any country, if the friendship and assistance of these countries are valued by us.</p>
<p>Stilwell damaged Sino-American relations throughout his stay in China, and his degree of insult may have reached its peak at a press conference after Washington decided to recall him. Stilwell's words were of course "off the record," but like many "off the record" words, they were often printed later. I didn't keep a copy of the "Newsweek" that published this, so I can only rely on my memory.</p>
<p>As I recall, General Stilwell's evaluation of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek when he left Chongqing was a "deception."</p>
<h3>Security Council to Investigate Czech Coup Despite Soviet Opposition, Chiang Ting-fu Clarifies China's Position</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, One-Day Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council, despite Soviet opposition, seems poised to order an investigation into the Soviet Union's role in the Czech Communist coup. The case is now scheduled for a formal vote next week. Although the Soviet Union and Ukraine are both vigorously opposed, China, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Syria have formally expressed their support. Argentina, Belgium, and Colombia have also indicated their intention to support the case. The required majority is seven votes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 31st Dispatch] Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu today proposed a thorough investigation of the Czech incident, summoning key figures in the coup to the Security Council to explain the truth, and hoping that the Soviet Union would participate in this investigation. Chiang said that the Security Council and the world must face the Czech issue squarely and should not leave it for two or three to five years later. Chiang also compared the Czech issue to the Communist suppression war by the National Army in Northeast China, saying that both the Czech Republic and the northeastern provinces of China are cradles of conflict, and any special accident in either place is enough to shock the world. The United States advocates a full investigation of Chile's accusations that the Soviet Union assisted the Czech Communist Party in seizing power, and China expresses its support. Earlier, Chilean representative Cruz reiterated his country's request, urging the Security Council to investigate the Soviet Union's role in the Czech Communist coup and accusing the Soviet Union of being a reckless aggressor who would not hesitate to use hooligan tactics.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 31st Dispatch] The new representative of the Czech Communist government to the United Nations, Hu Tai-tek, today presented his credentials to the United Nations Secretary-General with a letter of appointment from Czech President Benes, stating that the former representative, Papanek, had been dismissed. Papanek still refuses to recognize the new representative's credentials, saying that he will not listen to it unless he receives a document personally signed by President Benes.</p>

<h3>Announcement of Convictions in Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) Corruption Case: Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin Sentenced to Imprisonment, Dong Chengdao and Five Others Acquitted, Zheng Zhonghe and Du Cen Exempted from Prosecution, Lu Jiaju, Huo Yongzhang, and Chen Timin to be Tried Upon Apprehension</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The district court announced the verdicts in the case of senior Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) officials accused of corruption yesterday afternoon in the Criminal Division One presided over by Judge Huang Guangyu. The main points of the judgment are as follows: Hou Aichang (former General Manager of the Materials Purchase and Sales Department of the Finance Department of CRRRA), for actions related to his duties, accepted improper benefits, sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and deprived of civil rights for four years. Jiang Renlin (former Section Chief of the Welfare Section of CRRRA) embezzled public property, sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and deprived of civil rights for four years. The two defendants were acquitted of other charges. Dong Chengdao (Director of the Finance Department), Hu Keshi (Director of the General Affairs Department), Tao Jingyuan (Section Chief of the Documentation Section), Pang Yuanlong (Section Chief of the Welfare Section), and Ding Tiansheng (Manager of the United Shengji Construction Factory) were all acquitted. Deng Zhonghe (General Manager of Anle Textile Factory) and Du Cen (Deputy Chief Auditor) were both exempted from prosecution. Excerpts of the judgment are listed below:</p>
<p>Hou Aichang's part (A) Regarding the sentencing: Hou Aichang was the General Manager of the Materials Purchase and Sales Department of CRRRA. The indictment alleged that he received a house to live in from Deng Zhonghe, the manager of Anle Textile Company, when he handled the sale of wool. The house is located at Room 15, 9th Floor, No. 1396 Yuyuan Road, which was originally leased by Deng Zhonghe and is now occupied by Hou Aichang. What should be investigated is whether Hou Aichang's residence in the house was in exchange for improper benefits related to his duties. Anle Textile Company purchased 1.12 million pounds of wool sold by CRRRA as relief supplies. Except for the state-owned China Textile Corporation, its purchase volume ranked first. Deng Zhonghe, the manager of the company, testified in court. However, the content and terms of the wool sales contract between CRRRA and Anle Company were found to be the same as those of other purchasers. It is difficult to equate it to actions that violated his duties, but the fact that Hou Aichang unconditionally accepted someone else's house to live in during the period of handling the sale of wool cannot be said to be unrelated to his duties. Next, let's discuss whether Hou Aichang received improper benefits. In other words, whether Deng Zhonghe gifted the house for residence. Deng Zhonghe argued, "The house was leased to him by Hou Aichang's relative, Wu Zhiwei," and presented a letter from Wu Zhiwei to Deng Zhonghe dated June 15, 35, and a business card from Deng Zhonghe to Wu Zhiwei as evidence during the investigation. The prosecutor believed that the letter was not delivered through the post office, and the writing on the business card was in pencil, so it was not difficult to fabricate them afterward, which is very true. Moreover, since the house was occupied by Hou Aichang and no lease contract was signed with Deng Zhonghe, it can be concluded that there was a gift of the house for residence. In order to find out the truth, this court inquired about the transfer of the electricity, telephone, and gas accounts of the house from Shanghai Electric Power Company, Shanghai Telephone Company, and Shanghai Gas Company respectively. According to the replies from the above three companies, all of them indicated that the account name was Hou Aichang, which proves that Hou Aichang's residence in the house was obviously unrelated to Wu Zhiwei, and the so-called lease by Wu Zhiwei is difficult to believe. Since he accepted someone else's house to live in during the period of handling the sale of wool, Hou Aichang's acceptance of improper benefits for actions related to his duties is undoubtedly conclusive evidence and should be punished in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, considering that the defendant has not violated his duties and that Shanghai was experiencing a housing shortage at the time, and he could not find a house to live in, it is not without compassion. Therefore, the original sentence is reduced and a term of imprisonment of three years and six months and deprivation of civil rights for four years is imposed to serve as a warning. The indictment alleged a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the same regulations, which does not match the facts of the crime, so the legal clauses of the indictment are changed, and this is explained.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding other parts—Sale of electric fans and barter of US cotton for yarn. Because there is no active evidence of the defendant's criminal intent, he should be acquitted in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Jiang Renlin's part (A) Regarding the sentencing: Jiang Renlin's five million yuan of petty cash was used for advance payments of hotel revolving funds, and he had made advance payments of one million yuan to the Nanjing Hotel, 400,000 yuan to the Wu Palace Hotel, and no other hotels had been paid in advance, which the defendant admitted without hesitation. When the CRRRA General Accounting Office inspected on May 29, 35, the supporting documents contained private advances mixed in, which was clearly stated in the inspection report. Gao Qingxiao, the director of the Investigation Office of the CRRRA, was also ordered to inspect the section. There were still no account books for this petty cash. In addition to handing over 900,000 yuan in cash, the payment documents could not be handed over for review at one time, but were extracted in three installments. The initial figure handed over was 4,842,500 yuan, then changed to 5,032,570 yuan, then changed to 5,011,920 yuan. Finally, after reviewing the cuspidor receipt for 190,000 yuan, which should be deleted, the petty cash balance of the section was 4,821,920 yuan, a difference of 178,000 yuan. Gao Qingxiao, the director of the Investigation Office, not only made a written report, but also testified in court, which is credible. Moreover, Jiang Renlin claimed at the time that the 190,000 yuan for the porcelain cuspidor was advanced by him, while Chen Tingchang, the person in charge, claimed that the money was advanced by him, as evidenced by the interrogation record of the office, with Chen Tingchang's private seal affixed to it. How can he use excuses to avoid responsibility? Therefore, the defendant Jiang Renlin's embezzlement of public property is undoubtedly guilty and should be punished in accordance with Article [number unclear] of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, considering that the suspect only occupied a small number, and the circumstances are pitiful, a reduced sentence of imprisonment for three years and six months, and deprivation of civil rights for four years, is imposed to serve as a warning.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the remaining parts: The shortage of Japanese-retained furniture in Ruifengli, the repair of houses in Ruifengli, and the purchase of iron beds and office tables and chairs, were accused of engaging in private malfeasance. Due to insufficient evidence, they are acquitted.</p>
<p>Parts for Dong Chengdao and Others: The remaining points of the accusations against Dong Chengdao, Tao Jingyuan, Hu Keshi, Pang Yuanlong, and Ding Tiansheng all lack active corroboration, and they are acquitted in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Part for Zheng Zhonghe: As for Zheng Zhonghe's part, when he paid improper benefits to Hou Aichang in July 35, the indictment alleged that he violated Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. The most severe penalty for this is imprisonment for a term of not more than three years. In accordance with the provisions of Item A of the National Government's Amnesty and Commutation Order, he should be acquitted. Part for Du Cen: The indictment alleged that Du Cen violated Article 9 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The most severe penalty for this article is imprisonment for a term of not more than three years. Even if the crime committed by the defendant is real, since it was before December 31, 35, according to the above explanation, a judgment of acquittal should be pronounced.</p>
<p>As for the defendant Lu Jiaju, who went to the United States on official business, he was not legally summoned, and he will be tried separately after his apprehension. In addition, the two defendants, Huo Yongzhang and Chen Timin, have not been arrested despite orders to do so, and they will be tried again after they are apprehended. This is also explained.</p>
<h3>Rather Sit in Jail Than Return Home, Flying General's Marital Dispute Case, His Wife Du Qin Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office held a hearing on the marital dispute case between Flying General Wang Zhuo and his wife Du Qin yesterday, and Du Qin was detained. Before the hearing, relatives and friends of the Wang and Du families came forward to mediate. Du Qin insisted on a divorce, and Wang Zhuo's side agreed to consider a divorce, but only if she guaranteed that she would not marry her lover [unclear] who was studying in the United States. Because Du Qin loved Tan Xiqie deeply, she did not agree to this condition. When the court opened yesterday, Wang requested two points from the prosecutor: if Du Qin is found guilty, please prosecute her; if Du Qin is found not guilty, please hand her over to him to take home for discipline. He said that Du Qin's guarantors were unreliable and that she might flee. The prosecutor immediately asked Du Qin whether she was willing to go home with Wang Zhuo. Du said that she would rather sit in jail than return home. At this point, the prosecutor immediately detained Du Qin and postponed the hearing.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing the Index: New Methods Under Consideration; Social Affairs Bureau Director Advocates Organizing a Joint Distribution Center for Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The city's Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, at its 18th meeting, resolved to send a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau suggesting that the central government increase the types and quantities of in-kind provisions for workers (i.e., adding clothing items in addition to rice, coal, oil, and sugar) and reduce the allocated prices, in order to stabilize the price index and prevent it from increasing monthly. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday: "Expanding the allocation of daily necessities for workers is certainly the best way to suppress the cost of living index. However, the government has already done what it can. Currently, further expanding allocations is quite difficult due to the shortage of materials. I personally advocate organizing a joint distribution center for workers' daily necessities in the city. Various factories would supply the distribution center with products related to the cost of living, and these would be allocated to workers throughout the city at cost price. In this way, workers can obtain allocations at low prices, and the cost of living index can be compiled based on the allocated prices. The Social Affairs Bureau will convene responsible parties from several important industrial trade associations in the city next week to discuss this matter."</p>
<p>A Problem That Is Still Difficult to Solve</p>
<p>Director Wu also stated that the principle of this method has been established, but there is one difficulty worth considering: factories such as machinery plants and cement plants cannot supply the joint distribution center with daily necessities, but their workers' wages would still be calculated based on the cost of living index compiled from the allocated prices. The authorities can only compile one type of index, and factories should enjoy the benefits universally, and their obligations must also be universal. He has not yet come up with a solution to this difficulty and will raise it for discussion at next week's meeting.</p>
<h3>Suspicions of Misappropriation of Preferential Treatment Funds in the Lukouchiao and Hsihui Districts</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Military Service Association, in conjunction with the Civil Affairs Bureau, previously dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate the collection of preferential treatment funds for families with no draftees in various districts. It was found that the Lukouchiao District had collected 332,980,000 yuan by the deadline of the 18th of last month, of which only 107,160,000 yuan was remitted to the city treasury, with 225,820,000 yuan remaining unremitted in the district. The Hsihui District had collected 140,570,000 yuan by the deadline of the 20th of last month, of which only 103,560,000 yuan was remitted to the treasury, with 37,010,000 yuan remaining unremitted in the district. The Civil Affairs Bureau now suspects that these two districts have misappropriated public funds and will transfer the case to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Funeral of Chu Fu-cheng Yesterday: Chairman Chiang and President Chang Send Condolences to the Family Upon Hearing the News</h3>

<h3>The Voluntary Inspection Brigade Is Being Disbanded</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Command's Voluntary Inspection Brigade was formed by reorganizing the Citizen Training Corps, which had previously participated in the "August 13th" battle and made meritorious contributions. Since its establishment, the brigade has assisted the government in implementing laws and regulations, and its activities in investigating and preventing suspected criminals have been quite beneficial. However, the Garrison Command recently complied with orders from the central government because the Voluntary Inspection Brigade conflicted with regulations that local self-defense teams should be established during the period of suppression of rebellion. Commander Xuan has ordered the brigade to cease activities and be disbanded starting from the 1st of this month. A tea party was held at the Public Training Club on the afternoon of the 1st to commend and encourage all cadres. Each cadre was allowed to voluntarily transfer to the volunteer police or self-defense team to continue serving the country.</p>
<h3>Another 2,000+ Tons of Japanese Reparations Arrive: Machinery and Equipment Still Dominant</h3>

As for when the second batch of Japanese reparations materials will start arriving and their quantities and types, according to sources from the Supervision and Transportation Committee, the decision must be made by the Allied Headquarters in Japan through a lottery distribution, and nothing has been heard so far.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Suspected Automobiles: Enemy-Occupied and Puppet Regime Property Clearing Office Requests Police Assistance in Investigation</h3>
<p>The city's police department previously received a notice from the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy-Occupied and Puppet Regime Property Clearing Office in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui region, stating that among the 30 enemy-occupied and puppet regime automobiles received, there were suspicions of unauthorized use or resale for profit.

The original draft articles are recorded below: Article 1: These regulations are formulated in accordance with the eight key points for police and household registration agencies to investigate and report on households issued by the Ministry of Interior during the period of suppression of rebellion, and the four principles for the joint handling of household registration investigation and recording by the Civil Affairs and Police Bureaus as resolved at the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal Meeting No. 119.

A wooden sign reading "Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs and Police Bureau □□ District Household Registration Application Office" shall be hung in front of each accepting location. After the various household registration applications are accepted by the aforementioned application offices, each application office within the same Bao shall bring the accepted household registration application documents to the Bao office where they are located on the same day for exchange. The various household registration application forms are divided into five copies: A, B, C, D, and E. Copies A and B are sent by the Bao office to the district office and the Civil Affairs Bureau, and copies C and D are sent by the household registration police officer to the police branch and the general bureau.

(2) For transient population registration, the head of household is the person obligated to apply. Article 4: During the period of suppression of rebellion, applications for various types of household registration shall be made within three days after the event occurs or is confirmed.

If the people fail to apply for registration without justified reason beyond the deadline, they may be punished directly in accordance with the latter part of Article 53 of the Household Registration Law without a notice procedure. If necessary, they may be punished in accordance with Article 57 of the Police Penalty Law. Late applications shall still be accepted. (Remaining omitted)</p>
<p>Internal Telegram Reply to the Assembly: Continue to Handle in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of household registration transfers in the city, the Ministry of Interior previously consulted the city government on transferring it to the jurisdiction of the Police Bureau. The City Council believed that it was not in accordance with the law and sent a telegram to the central government requesting that the decision be rescinded. Yesterday, the Ministry of Interior sent a telegram back to the Council, stating that it should still be handled in accordance with the Household Registration Law and its implementing regulations in order to adapt to the security needs of various places during the war.</p>

<h3>Three Bank of China Employees Not Prosecuted by the District Court: No Crime of Disturbing Order</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The Four Banks and One Bureau previously demanded higher compensation, resulting in a labor strike. Liu Shanliang, Zhou Yao, and Zhang Song, three employees of the Bank of China, were suspected of inciting the strike and were arrested by the police department and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Hu decided not to prosecute. The reasons for not prosecuting were approximately three: (1) The Morning Star Industrial and Commercial Management Regulations for special times only apply to designated enterprises, and the Bank of China has not received such an order. (2) Liu, Zhou, and Zhang did not propose the terms "equal work" and "sit-in." (3) The Joint Newsletter and Joint Newsletter Express cannot prove that the accused was the organizer, and there is no incitement language in it. Liu and the other two's usual behavior was explained by the Bank of China as being quite peaceful, and there was no crime of disturbing order, so they were not prosecuted.</p>
<p>Vast Losses Due to Excessive Electricity Theft Transferred from Electric Current Purchased in Bulk</p>
<h3>The Person in Charge of the Dahao Electric Plant Explains the Truth About Collecting Electricity Fees</h3>
<p>Vast Losses Due to Excessive Electricity Theft Transferred from Electric Current Purchased in Bulk</p>
<p>The electrical business in Dahao, Liuhe, Gucun, and other places not far from Shanghai has always been operated by the Daluo Electric Plant. Recently, some users in the area petitioned the Public Utilities Bureau and other places due to electricity fee issues, and released statements to reporters, believing that the electricity fees set by the plant were higher than in the urban area, expressing their dissatisfaction. To clarify the truth, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited the person in charge of the plant, who said: Due to the complex environment in the area, the company's business could not be promoted. Therefore, after the victory, Wang Yingru initially resumed the business, followed by Tian Rongyu taking over, but both were unable to continue due to income not covering expenses. Recently, it was reorganized into a joint-stock company, and the business was entrusted to the Far East Electric Investment Company for management, with the aim of seeking business and technical improvements to reduce costs and achieve rational development. The plant has no power generation equipment, and the current supplied is purchased in bulk from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in the city. Therefore, the electricity price charged could not be consistent with the urban area. In the past, the difference was about a 100% increase. In fact, due to excessive electricity theft and outdated equipment, the loss of electricity alone was about 50%. Now, since the reorganization into a joint-stock company in February, the electricity price set is only 50% higher than the cost of electricity, barely enough to pay for the electricity purchased. All other expenses are completely uncovered. Now, the company is making every effort to rectify the situation, and the percentage of electricity loss has been slightly reduced. With perseverance and gradual improvement, users and the company will surely benefit. The company's electricity price for February has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so it is temporarily charged according to the January electricity price. After approval, any surplus will be refunded, and any shortfall will be collected. Therefore, it will be proved by the facts at that time whether the electricity price is higher or lower than before, and whether it is exploiting users to seek exorbitant profits. Moreover, more than 80% of the users in the area have already paid in advance according to the January electricity price, which shows that most users can understand, and a small number of users are indeed misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>The Central and Communications Banks are Proceeding Systematically with This Year's Loan Program; Loan Types are Divided into National Policy, Business, and Contracted Goods Categories</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is learned that the loan programs of the Central and Communications Banks for this year, after being approved in principle by the Four Joint Offices, will generally be carried out in three major categories: national policy, business, and contracted goods. The nature of the loans is roughly as follows: (1) National Policy Loans: These are submitted by the Four Joint Offices and then approved by the Central and Communications Banks.

<h3>Public Sentiment Difficult to Boost; Stock Market Listlessly Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The stock market opened lower yesterday, and public sentiment remained difficult to buoy. Arbitrage prices also gradually decreased, significantly reducing the desire to buy. Except for Datong and Match, which remained stable, most stocks declined. It is feared that the future cannot be restored in a short period.</p>
<p>Initially, there was no significant change. Yongsheng opened at 1605 yuan and 1720 yuan. No. 218 bought for immediate delivery, and No. 157 bid for deferred delivery, rising to 1628 yuan and 1745 yuan.

No. 157 and others bought for deferred delivery, and No. 232 and others bought for immediate delivery. The market stabilized, and funds appeared to loosen, rising to 1642 yuan and 1745 yuan. Ultimately, public sentiment could not bear the burden of the discount system, and many sold off, resulting in sluggish trading and a lack of support. No. 235 and others closed out their deferred delivery, and No. 231 and others again sold for immediate delivery, forcing the market lower. No. 186 also offered for immediate delivery, and the low price reached 1550 yuan and 1635 yuan near noon. No. 157 occasionally absorbed deferred delivery, and No. 207 and others also provided support. No. 69 and others bought for immediate delivery, and the market rose to 1560 yuan and 1660 yuan at the close. Compared with the previous closing prices, Xinhe, Shangwu, Xinguang, Yonggong, Xinyi, Tongyi, China France Goods, and Xinhua each fell by 0.5%, Hengfeng fell by a little less than 1%, Datong rose slightly, and the rest slightly declined. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Yongsheng, Quanxing, and Xinguang rose slightly, while Xinhe fell slightly, due to the burden of the discount.</p>
<p>The market opened steadily in the afternoon, and Yongsheng opened at 1570 yuan and 1650 yuan. No. 105 and others bid for deferred delivery, and No. 16 and others bought for immediate delivery, rising to 1588 yuan and 1670 yuan. No. 69 and others took advantage of the high prices to sell for immediate delivery, and No. 157 and others closed out their deferred delivery, falling to 1560 yuan and 1638 yuan. No. 99 and others bought for immediate delivery, and No. 131 and others bid for deferred delivery, rebounding to 1575 yuan and 1653 yuan. No. 156 and others sold down to a low price of 1553 yuan and 1631 yuan. The National Bank intervened, and No. 94 and others supplemented deferred delivery, while No. 62 and others bought for immediate delivery, rising to 1570 yuan and 1655 yuan. The closing price was 1560 yuan and 1638 yuan. Compared with the morning closing prices, Zhabei, Yongsheng, Tongyi, and China Silk were flat, Hengfeng, Xinhe, Shangwu, Match, Yonggong, Lianan, and Xinhua rose slightly, and the rest slightly declined. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Xinhe was flat, and the rest slightly declined. Among the unlisted stocks outside the market, cultural stocks were the weakest, falling by 0.5%, and the rest were also soft.</p>
<p>Arbitrage trading saw an increase in positions participating in arbitrage groups yesterday. With multiple parties shifting their positions, the discount gradually decreased. The interest rate advanced from 0.3 to less than 0.2 yuan, ultimately settling at around 0.212 yuan. The discount for Yongsheng initially opened at 120 yuan, retreated to 77 yuan, and closed at 85 yuan.</p>
<p>Internal Transfer Trade Volume Significantly Increased</p>
<p>Another Report: Several brokers, for the sake of serving their clients, tried out internal transfer trading. The settlement processing fee opened at 28 yuan to 31 yuan yesterday, which was very popular among clients. Strict adherence to the exchange regulations meant that all transactions were made via internal transfer. The number of transactions significantly increased yesterday, with immediate delivery Yongsheng reaching 565,300,000 shares and deferred delivery Yongsheng reaching 528,000,000 shares. Total transactions for immediate delivery shares reached 1,089,354,000 shares, and deferred delivery shares reached 623,400,000 shares, an unprecedented scene.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>

<h3>Establishment of the Hongkou Branch of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In order to strengthen the control of treasury funds, the Central Bank, after the Four Joint Offices resolved to transfer all existing treasury funds of military and political organizations from other national banks to the treasury departments of the National Bank, the National Bank negotiated with the banks in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan to complete the transfer by the end of March. At the same time, to facilitate the various military and political organizations, it was decided to establish paying and receiving offices in major cities to meet their needs. After active preparations by the local National Bank authorities in this city, they have obtained the original site of the Hongkou Office of the Municipal Bank at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wujin Road to establish the Hongkou Receiving Office of the National Treasury Bureau, which officially opened yesterday (the 1st) morning.

<h3>Rice Prices Rebound Yesterday After Increase in Rationed Rice Prices; Flour Merchants Held Firm, More Stable Than Before</h3>
<p>Rice prices rose slightly yesterday in the Nanshi market, and stabilized in the Beishi market. Although the Nanshi market rose, the actual sales were still normal, so the market softened later. The morning opening was boosted by the high price of rationed rice for the second phase, reaching 3.1 million yuan, and the Civil Food Allocation Association did not sell rice on the market yesterday, which boosted public sentiment. Moreover, the price had fallen sharply the previous day, and merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, increasing them by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Although rice prices rose yesterday, the sales were flat. Local shops mainly sell rationed rice and rarely supplement from the market, so the market slightly softened later. Prices in the Beishi market changed little, with only early rice and special indica rice rising slightly by 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 6,045 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets.</p>

Local shops were slow to sell, so they did not buy much. The market later fell back slightly, but ultimately rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

Sesame supply and demand were equal, and the market was firm. The price of raw peanuts saw little fluctuation.</p>

<h3>The Export-Import Management Committee has No Office Expenses; It Plans to Levy a Handling Fee on Imported Goods</h3>
<p>Import and export industries are calling for opposition from all parties</p>
<p>According to sources from the Export-Import Management Committee, the government's budget did not include regular office expenses for the committee, resulting in a lack of funds. Therefore, it is proposed that the Executive Yuan authorities levy a handling fee of 1/1000 on imported goods, which will be collected when importers apply for an import permit, to cover the committee's office expenses. This measure is currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan's Full Economic Committee, and whether it will be implemented has not yet been decided. This news has been confirmed by the committee. The Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association is greatly concerned and expresses its opposition. Because the committee's expenses should not be passed on to import manufacturers, it is actually setting up a pretext to collect fees. It is also said that the total annual import volume of China is about 400 million US dollars. If 1/1000 is levied, it will be 400,000 US dollars, equivalent to 100 billion yuan in national currency. Importers firmly oppose this.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Declined Yesterday</h3>

In the afternoon, many operators with tight positions dumped their holdings, and the market became sluggish again. Finally, ten packs of British American Tobacco and Old Knife cigarettes plummeted by 4.3 to 5 million yuan compared to the previous day, and other domestic and foreign cigarettes were also weak and lifeless.</p>
<h3>Floating Long Positions Frequently Sold Off; Yarn and Cotton Markets Sluggish; Fabric Sales Stagnant and Transactions Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw unstable sentiment, weak buyer interest, and a reluctance to buy among local yarn merchants and replicating factories. As a result, general floating long positions began to sell off, causing prices to turn from stable to sluggish.</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially remained above the 200 million yuan mark, but due to the opportunistic selling by the platform group, asking prices collapsed to 190 million yuan. Near the close, opportunistic counter-trading brought prices back to 192 million yuan, but it still closed 11 million yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>21-count Double Horse yarn opened at 124 million yuan, but due to selling from floating short positions, it plummeted to 117 million yuan at the close, down 7 million yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Other coarse and fine yarns such as 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, 40-count, and 32-count also fell by 4-5 million to 6-7 million and 13-14 million yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's cotton cloth market saw the Spinning and Weaving Corporation supply goods again, which coincided with falling yarn prices and weak buyer interest. General retail investors sold off at high prices and bought in when prices were low. Cloth merchants also sold off at high prices, resulting in active market trading but few actual transactions and a hovering and sluggish market.</p>
<p>12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.17 million yuan and rose to a high price of 4.27 million yuan due to buying from speculative longs. However, cloth merchants took advantage of the high prices to compete for sales, pulling prices back to 4.16 million yuan at the close, leveling with the previous day. However, Blue Chicken and colored ball fine cloth rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Other broadcloth, Zhigong, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and ten-link cloth saw mixed results.</p>

<h3>Vice Minister Tian Peilin Reports on the Grand Occasion of the Taiwan Provincial Cultural Relics Exhibition</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, 1st of the month] The Taiwan Cultural Relics Exhibition opened in Taiwan Province a few days ago. The Ministry of Education has just received a report from Vice Minister Tian Peilin, who went to preside over the exhibition, regarding the exhibition situation.</p>
<p>According to the report: The exhibition is divided into three categories: (1) Calligraphy and painting, provided by Shanghai collectors, including authentic works of handwriting from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties by Su Shi, Wen Yanbo, Wang Shouren, Huang Daozhou, Shen Baozhen, and others, as well as paintings by various famous artists since the Song dynasty. (2) Books, from the collection of the Central Library, with a focus on systematically demonstrating that woodblock printing and movable type were invented in our country. Woodblock printing began in the Tang dynasty, became popular in the late Tang dynasty, and movable type was invented in the Song dynasty. (3) Bronze ware (including bronze mirrors), ceramics (including pottery figurines), and compasses. Bronze casting had good inventions and achievements in ancient times. The prehistoric Gansu "Painted Pottery" had already been successful. Glazing was known in the Han dynasty, there was tricolor in the Tang dynasty, and porcelain was invented. Porcelain improved further after the Song dynasty, and porcelain in the Qing dynasty became even more developed. Pottery figurines are funerary objects, and the clothing and accessories of the Han and Tang dynasties can be seen in general, which are good specimens for the history of sculpture. The compass is from the Central Museum. In the Han dynasty, there was a "Sinan" (South-pointing chariot), which was divided into 24 directions to distinguish directions. In the early Song dynasty, a prototype of the modern compass was made, which was used in navigation. The above exhibits illustrate the superiority of Chinese culture, which has a unique style in the world of art. The invention of the compass made it possible to discover the New World, and the printing technology was transmitted to Europe, providing a shortcut for cultural dissemination and increasing unlimited happiness for mankind. The Taiwanese compatriots have gained a deeper understanding of the motherland by seeing the history of the past.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Disputes Arising from Inability to Relocate Due to Important Business Location</p>
<p>Lu Fan asks: My friend, Mr. A, runs a small shop in Shanghai, and the property belongs to Mr. B. Mr. B's family is declining and plans to sell the house, but A cannot afford to buy it. I have several questions and respectfully request answers:</p>
<p>(1) If the property is purchased by a third party (C), can the purchaser reclaim it for their own use based on property rights? (2) A has been a long-term tenant for decades and has never been late with rent. Because the shop is located in an important location and has a good reputation, it is difficult to relocate. I wonder if A has the legal right to continue to lease the property with C? (3) If C forces A to move, can A demand compensation for all losses incurred due to relocation?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Fu Kuang] (1) C's acquisition of the ownership of B's house naturally belongs to the right to dispose of it and can be freely used for income. A, as the original tenant of the house, can continue to lease the property from C according to Article 425 of the Civil Code. (3) A's business losses and renting the house are separate matters. Compensation for damages cannot be claimed from the lessor due to relocation issues.</p>

<h3>Problem of Tuberculosis Prevention</h3>
<p>— Qian Mu Han</p>
<p>Before discussing the problem of tuberculosis prevention, we must understand the severity of tuberculosis, also known as consumption. This disease is prevalent worldwide. In all civilized countries of Europe, America, and Asia, the incidence and mortality rates of this disease are higher than those of other infectious diseases. In recent years, due to the advancement of public health in European and American countries, the mortality rate has significantly decreased. However, in our country, this disease is still extremely prevalent. Currently, there are no nationwide statistics, but according to partial surveys in Beiping, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, the mortality rate is approximately 300 deaths per 100,000 people per year. Based on the national population, more than one million people die from this disease annually. Considering that for every death from tuberculosis, there are ten patients, it is estimated that approximately ten million people in our country suffer from this disease each year.</p>
<p>This disease is a "cultural disease." Civilized countries have extremely high infection rates, and cities are more affected than rural areas. According to surveys in various regions, almost no adult in our country can avoid infection. However, "infection" means having been exposed to tubercle bacilli, not necessarily that every person has contracted the disease. According to a report by Dr. Lai Douyan in Shanghai in 1934, the infection rate for ages 0 to 4 was 9.3% in urban areas and 5.7% in rural areas. For ages 5 to 9, it was 53.3% in urban areas and 32.2% in rural areas. For ages 10 to 14, it was 72.0% in urban areas and 49.3% in rural areas. For ages 15 to 19, it was 81.8% in urban areas and 63.0% in rural areas. The degree of infection is directly proportional to age. Tuberculosis can infect various organs in the human body, but it is most likely to infect the lungs. The percentage is above 80%, so tuberculosis prevention must focus on preventing pulmonary tuberculosis. The first method of tuberculosis prevention is vaccination with the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, BCG. The principle of immunization is the same as that of vaccination against smallpox. However, its immune function is only about 7:1. That is, the tuberculosis rate for unvaccinated individuals is 7%, while the tuberculosis rate for vaccinated individuals drops to 1%. Before BCG vaccination, a tuberculin test must be performed. If the reaction is positive, it indicates that tubercle bacilli have already invaded the body, so vaccination is not suitable. The second method of tuberculosis prevention is early diagnosis, which can be achieved through widespread screening using small fluoroscopy X-ray machines. The cost is extremely low, and the work is quick. Early pulmonary tuberculosis is easily curable. Artificial pneumothorax surgery is very effective, even if hospitalization is not time-consuming. For acute cases, streptomycin injections may lead to full recovery. The third method of tuberculosis prevention is strict isolation of patients with active tuberculosis. Any sputum, feces, or other excrement containing tubercle bacilli must be disinfected to prevent transmission to others, and home isolation requires special attention. The fourth method of tuberculosis prevention is health education. This allows the general public to understand the causes of tuberculosis, the seriousness of transmission routes, and prevention methods. In particular, indiscriminate spitting is the most dangerous. Recently, public figures have raised a large sum of money to promote a campaign to discourage spitting. We can see clear slogans discouraging spitting in public places and on lampposts, which is of no small benefit to the population. In addition, the use of sanitary chopsticks is equally important. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will vigorously promote this, and the future results of tuberculosis prevention should be able to eradicate the disease.</p>
<h3>Good Methods for Overcoming Addiction to Anesthetics</h3>
<p>— Liang Jun Qing</p>
<p>According to a report by Mr. Lodinos of Alexandria, Egypt, he used Mr. M. Vivian's method to help patients overcome addiction to anesthetics in a total of eighty cases. The results were excellent and worthy of introduction to colleagues. Here is a brief translation:</p>
<p>According to Modianos, after using this method to overcome addiction, patients can stop taking anesthetics without any withdrawal symptoms. However, it is impossible to prevent patients from wanting to relapse into this addiction (in fact, no good method of overcoming addiction can remove the patient's psychological attachment to the addictive substance). Even though patients have overcome the addiction, their psychological attachment is not easily changed, and some still think about using the addictive substance one or two years later. In addition, patients often have a psychological fear that they will become weak after overcoming the addiction and unable to cope with various illnesses caused by weakness. As a result, this psychological build-up over time leads to genuine illnesses and the need to rely on addictive substances. According to Mr. Ma's opinion, it is best to travel for several months after overcoming addiction, or at least not to return to the original lifestyle in a short period (for example, opera singers should not resume their opera-singing life within three months after overcoming addiction), otherwise, it is very easy to relapse into the original addiction. According to experience, the longer the period of using addictive substances, the more difficult it is to overcome the addiction.</p>
<p>This method of overcoming addiction can be used to overcome addictions to morphine, heroin, cocaine, and alcohol. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>For example, consider a patient who is addicted to morphine, whose daily intake is 0.3gm and who has been addicted for five years. To help them overcome the addiction, on the first day, three blistering plasters are applied to the upper thigh in the morning. Each plaster is about four cubic centimeters in size, and the distance between each plaster should not be too far so that they can be covered with a large piece of gauze. If there is a lot of leg hair, it must be shaved off. Usually, by the morning of the second day, a large blister has formed under each plaster (similar to a burn). At about 10 or 11 am, the plaster should be gently removed to avoid breaking the blister. Then, use a 10 cc syringe with a thicker needle to extract the liquid from the blister and inject the liquid (the patient's own serum) into the patient's buttock muscle using a thinner needle. If the serum in the blister leaks out when the plaster is removed because the blister sac has already broken, a sterilized glass tube can be used to collect it, then use a syringe to extract it and inject it into the patient's buttock muscle. If there is sediment in the serum, it must be removed before injection. After the serum has been extracted from the blister, a sterile gauze with a mild ointment, such as boric acid ointment, should be used to wrap it to protect the wound. If the amount of serum extracted for the first time is only about 5 cc, it must be re-extracted the next day. This method of blistering and extracting serum must be performed three times, once every three days. As for morphine, 0.7gm of morphine can be given on the second day after the serum injection, and then 0.12mp on the third day, 0.15gm on the fourth day, 0.7gm on the fifth day, 0.06 on the sixth day, 0.03 on the seventh day, and 0.015mp on the eighth day. From the ninth day, morphine can be discontinued. Starting on the sixth day, 0.06 of codeine can be added to the injection in addition to morphine. The amount of codeine is determined by the amount of morphine reduced and the patient's needs. If the patient has insomnia, anxiety, and limb pain, 0.06 of codeine can be injected three or four times. This codeine injection does not cause as much pain as morphine when injected subcutaneously, and it is easy for the patient to recognize. At this time, it is necessary to deal with it carefully and prevent the patient from noticing it. Although codeine is not as addictive as morphine, if the patient knows about it, it can easily affect their psychology.</p>
<p>Starting from the eighth or ninth day, emetine can be injected into the patient (this drug is especially effective for alcoholics). Inject 0.03 or 0.02gm subcutaneously once a day, about seven days, then change to injecting once every other day, and after fourteen days, change to injecting once every two days. (And so on.)</p>
<p>The most important thing to pay attention to when overcoming addiction is not to let the patient know the name of the drug used by the doctor each time. It is best to declare to the patient at the beginning of treatment that you will not answer any questions about medical issues in the future, so that they give up asking. If fatigue, pain, and other phenomena occur during the withdrawal period, glucose, calcium, and vitamins can be injected to treat them. If the withdrawal symptoms (i.e., addiction symptoms) are too severe, a slightly larger amount of morphine can be injected than the last injection. If the morphine has been reduced to zero, 0.02-0.03gm can be injected, but of course, this cannot be told to the patient to avoid adverse psychological changes. The above methods and dosages are of course different for each person and cannot be rigidly adhered to. Sometimes, a fourth blistering and serum extraction operation may be necessary in fact. Sometimes, the disease is completely cured after one or two blistering and serum extraction operations. In short, it is necessary to deal with it well.</p>
<p>If the patient has insomnia, Chloralbydrat or Paraldehyd can be given to him, and it will definitely be effective. We know that the addiction has been truly overcome when the patient is energetic, has an increased appetite, and can sleep peacefully after overcoming the addiction. If he can travel for two or three months after overcoming the addiction, or at least let him rest for two or three months without immediately resuming his original life, his recovery will be truly guaranteed. On the other hand, if the patient seeks painkillers after overcoming the addiction, his psychology will be shaken again, and he will inevitably be in danger of relapsing into the old disease.

<h3>Good Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>Up to now, all medicines for pulmonary tuberculosis can be said to have no absolute efficacy. Although streptomycin, which has been widely promoted in newspapers and magazines recently, has been proven in animal experiments to have the absolute efficacy of inhibiting the reproduction of tubercle bacilli, its clinical trials are still limited to certain types of tuberculosis and have not fully met expectations. In addition, streptomycin is scarce, expensive, and its treatment time is very long, which is beyond the reach of ordinary patients. As for the clinical efficacy of streptomycin for tuberculosis, there are no statistics for the time being, and no rash judgment can be made. However, according to the experience of foreign doctors, it is very effective for miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis. What was once thought to be an incurable disease now has cases of complete cure, which can be considered a happy event.</p>
<p>I have also personally encountered a case of miliary tuberculosis, which was cured with streptomycin. The patient was a four-year-old boy who suddenly lost weight and had no appetite. Afterwards, his body temperature rose and remained high. Traditional Chinese medicine thought it was typhoid fever, but it was not cured after a long time. So I asked my colleague, Dr. Ni, to diagnose and treat him. After careful examination, Dr. Ni suggested testing blood and fluoroscopically examining the lungs. As a result, the blood test showed no typhoid reaction. The X-ray showed light gray lungs covered with millet grains. Dr. Ni diagnosed it as miliary tuberculosis. He held the photo and discussed it with me. I suggested treating it with streptomycin and asked him to pay attention to the consequences. Four months later, Dr. Ni told me that the patient had gone to Hangzhou with his parents to recuperate. Since starting streptomycin, the situation has been very good, the weight has obviously increased, and the fever has gradually subsided. However, for four months, the medication has not been interrupted (more than one hundred bottles of streptomycin have been injected). The patient was initially the only child, and his family was willing to bear any high burden to prolong his life. However, since his parents had a new son, the patient had lost his center of love, so they said they were going to Hangzhou to recuperate. The treatment was interrupted. However, comparing the X-ray photos before and after treatment, the disease has greatly improved. Without streptomycin, the patient may have died long ago.</p>
<p>However, streptomycin is mostly ineffective for the third stage of active pulmonary tuberculosis. According to clinical experiments, the role of streptomycin is to inhibit the growth of bacteria, not to kill bacteria. According to the latest reports, the US government has banned the export of streptomycin because it is still in the experimental stage and does not have the rumored efficacy for human pulmonary tuberculosis. It may have an inhibitory effect on complications or variants of pulmonary tuberculosis, but it does not have an absolute effect on tubercle bacilli in the human body. As for urethral tuberculosis and kidney tuberculosis, it is known to be ineffective. Therefore, the scope of treatment with streptomycin today has been greatly reduced and cannot replace symptomatic treatment methods such as air needles. Everything remains to be worked on by experts.

<h3>Artificial Teeth</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>I am fifty years old, and I only have seventeen teeth left in my mouth, and most of them are loose. But I have a good appetite and still want to eat something in this world. So, I contacted a reader, Yi Zhaoxue, who is a dentist, and asked him to pull out all seventeen of my useless teeth and install a full set of dentures. I don't like the word "fake," so I call them "artificial teeth." If you don't have a son, you adopt an orphan. This son is called an "adopted son." If you don't have teeth, you install dentures, and these teeth can of course be called "artificial teeth."</p>
<p>Yi Zhaoxue, the dentist, pulled out seventeen teeth from my mouth in eleven days. I didn't feel any pain at all, so I wrote him a four-character couplet: "Advancing in the way, man repeatedly triumphs over heaven." The first line has already been proven; the second line is my hope, which has not yet been proven. A month later, my gums shrank, so I went to take a mold and make artificial teeth. Early in the morning, my artificial teeth were indeed installed, neat, white, and very beautiful. Looking in the mirror, I looked twenty years younger!</p>
<p>However, it was very uncomfortable in my mouth. Holding two large pieces of something, it seemed temporary, and I often wanted to spit them out. When the tongue licked up, it was not my own flesh, but a stone slab, which was even more unnatural. When I spoke, the pronunciation was unclear, as if my tongue was swollen. Especially when eating something, I couldn't chew it tightly, and the upper and lower gums were very painful. I couldn't chew anything harder than rice, so I swallowed everything whole. Sometimes I wanted to practice. When eating porridge in the morning, I stubbornly put a peanut into my right molar, endured the pain and chewed hard. The peanut didn't break, but all the molars on the left side were raised. After rising, the rice grains in my mouth went into the middle of the gums and artificial teeth, and it hurt even more when I chewed again. So I had to stop eating porridge and take off the artificial teeth to wash them; I also rinsed my mouth with water, and then put them back on. Since I installed them on New Year's Day, for about a month, my artificial teeth were only good for looking at and not for use. In the meantime, I had to visit Yi Zhaoxue every day or two because my gums often hurt, so I asked him to modify the artificial teeth. After this part was repaired, it didn't hurt; but the next day, another part hurt, so I went to ask him to repair it again. From the beginning of the tooth extraction until a month after the installation, within about eighty or ninety days, I visited Yi Zhaoxue no less than dozens of times. I was like a teacher in Yi Zhaoxue's school, taking a rickshaw to attend class every day or two. From my home to Yi's house, the scenery, houses, and shops on the road were all familiar to me. I memorized all the words on the signboards. There were two children from a small household at the corner, a boy and a girl, the boy was about five years old, and the girl was about three years old, and they were very cute. Every time my rickshaw pulled past their door, I would pay attention to these two children. Sometimes they were playing; sometimes they were eating sweet potatoes; sometimes the younger one was crying, and the older one was scolding him; sometimes the two were fighting, all of which were very good to watch. I remember one time when I came back from repairing my teeth, the older one was gone, leaving only the younger one sitting alone on the threshold, pouting her little lips. I was very suspicious and worried. I wanted to stop the car and ask her, "Where did your brother go?" "Why are you worried?" But I felt that this was too abrupt, too meddlesome, and too inhuman, so I didn't ask after all. But this day I was always suspicious and always worried. Until the second time I went to repair my teeth, I saw these two children playing together as before, and I was relieved. Now, my artificial teeth have long been useful and don't need to be repaired. I haven't visited Yi Zhaoxue for a long time. I wonder if these two children are well. I really want to go and see them once. But wouldn't that be even more abrupt, more meddlesome, and more inhuman? I shouldn't go!</p>
<p>I've strayed too far from the topic! Let's quickly get back to my artificial teeth. Strangely enough, about a month after the installation, these artificial teeth gradually got better. There was no discomfort in my mouth at all, the pronunciation was very accurate, the gums were not full at all, and I could chew anything. In short, it could be said that they were the same as "real teeth."</p>
<p>I carefully tasted them, and there were two reasons why they got better: First, the gums were pressed by the stone slab for a month or two, and the skin became old and the resistance became stronger. Before, when I had "real teeth," I used the roots of my teeth to resist when chewing, and the gums were never responsible. So the gums were very tender and had no resistance. No wonder they couldn't bear the heavy pressure when they were first installed and had to hurt. Now that they are used to being pressed and used to chewing, they know that they will have to work hard from now on and strive to exercise, and they can actually succeed. From then on, the gums took over the duties of the tooth roots. Second, installing artificial teeth is like a primitive man who always used his fingers to eat using chopsticks for the first time. At first, the technique of holding chopsticks was very clumsy. I felt that using these two bamboo sticks to take food was so awkward and useless! It was so convenient and happy to take it directly with my fingers! But you must make him use chopsticks and never allow him to use his fingers. After training, he would actually get used to using them. Later, the technique of using chopsticks greatly improved. He could clip, mix, pull, pick, cut, and tear... It was as directly and happily, sensitively and conveniently as with his fingers. Installing artificial teeth is exactly the same as this primitive man using chopsticks. When they were first installed, one side had to be raised when the other side was chewing; the artificial teeth would be stuck off when eating glutinous rice balls; the upper and lower teeth could not be aligned when biting melon seeds; the broken layers of food would accumulate between the artificial teeth and the gums... All of these were due to poor skills. After a month or two of corrections, the skills improved, and the above-mentioned shortcomings were completely gone. Yi Zhaoxue's clinic is decorated with the four-character couplet I gave him: "Skill is in the way, man-made triumphs over heaven." When I used to go to repair my teeth, I felt very uncomfortable when I saw the last four words. I thought, "Man-made" may not be able to "triumph over heaven"! I praised him! I exaggerated too much! I made an advertisement for him with lies! This is so boring and unkind, and I really regret it. But the day before yesterday, I visited him for no reason, and I saw this four-character couplet again, and I was very happy. I didn't praise him, I didn't lie, and my hope was indeed realized! A few days ago, Mr. Zhang Xuecun from the Kaiming Bookstore came to drink with me. When we talked about this couplet, he made another one for me wittily:</p>
<p>Yi Ya can know the taste,</p>
<p>Bang Tong believes in talent.</p>
<p>I drank a large cup for this divinely crafted five-character couplet. This is much better, more accurate, and more ingenious than my four-character couplet. Yi Zhaoxue might as well change his name to Yi Ya. When his clinic expands, I want to write this five-character couplet again and send it to him. (March 28, 1948, West Lake.)</p>
<h3>Hotel School</h3>
<p>— Leng Leng</p>
<p>There is a private vocational school in a coastal state in the northern United States. Every year, at the beginning of summer vacation, the entire school holds a thorough cleaning. All blackboards, podiums, desks, and chairs are removed and piled up in the basement. The offices and classrooms are painted and renovated, looking brand new. The interior is decorated with exquisite furniture, and each classroom is decorated as a luxurious bedroom. In less than half a month, a school is transformed into a seaside hotel.</p>
<p>The principal serves as the manager, the faculty members act as accountants and head waiters, and the chef serves as the head waiter. Both male and female students receive short-term waiter training and serve as waiters.</p>
<p>Because the school is located on the coast, the temperature is moderate in midsummer, with a cool breeze, making it an ideal summer resort. In addition, the hotel is fully equipped - with sports fields, swimming pools, libraries, billiard rooms, and clubs. The service is attentive and the room rates are low, so every summer, wealthy gentlemen and ladies from all over come to escape the summer heat. The seaside hotel is always bustling with guests and hangs a "full" sign.</p>
<p>The net profit of the hotel's business is entirely allocated to funding, and no tuition or miscellaneous fees are charged according to regulations. Students can donate real objects to the best of their ability, regardless of quality or quantity. Even poor people who cannot afford to donate can enroll.</p>
<p>Therefore, after each semester starts, the farm is always raising cattle, sheep, pigs, etc., and the warehouse is full of flour, sugar, canned food, and hotel daily necessities.</p>
<p>The founder of the school was originally from a university. He spent his early years as a waiter and later became the manager of a large hotel. He felt that vocational education was not practical, so he decided to allocate funds to establish the school, so that knowledge and practice could be integrated. However, the school does not only have a hotel department, but also other practical departments such as machinery and civil engineering, and also has workshops and surveying instruments for practical training.</p>
<p>Most of the students in the school are children of the working class. Students in all departments must take turns serving as waiters. The purpose is to allow students to come into contact with high-ranking people before entering society and indirectly learn about human relations, which is of great benefit to serving society in the future. Moreover, students are mostly self-respecting and self-loving, and do their best in their positions, which has won high praise from tourists. Some have even been introduced to jobs by previous tourist patrons after graduation. Students can not only enroll for free, but also gain valuable experience in dealing with people, which helps their future careers. Isn't this a win-win situation?</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's schools, most of them are closed-door operations, and graduates do not meet the actual needs of society. Most can only get a position as a probationer or trainee, and must undergo special training. Many run into walls everywhere and are unemployed at home. Isn't this a waste of countless talents, time, and money?</p>
<p>Of course, our country lacks material conditions, and it is not easy to improve education. However, I hope that the education authorities will pay more attention and gradually promote practical vocational education. Then the students will be fortunate! Education will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate!</p>
<h3>Slim Bamboo Cures Seals</h3>
<p>— Xi Ya</p>
<p>The achievement of art must first progress from restraint to unrestrainedness, as the saying goes, "Without rules, there can be no squares or circles." Then, it must return from unrestrainedness to meticulousness, which is the so-called maturity of skill leading to simplicity. One who can pass through these three stages can reach a realm beyond the mundane. However, moving from the first to the second stage is easy, while moving from the second to the third stage is difficult. It requires decades of diligent study and, at the same time, broad and precise pursuit in academic fields; otherwise, one cannot discuss this matter. Because if one only focuses on learning artistic skills without studying other related disciplines, one inevitably becomes skilled in hand but lacking in vision, resulting in either vulgarity or ineptitude.</p>
<p>Zhen Jun Shou Zhu was fond of calligraphy and seal carving as early as his teens and devoted himself deeply to it, which was his period of moving from restraint to unrestrainedness. During the Anti-Japanese War, Qian Jun wandered in the Southwest. In those ten years, he carved seals for people everywhere and meticulously studied ancient epigraphic inscriptions, extending his knowledge to poetry, calligraphy, and painting, while also traveling to famous mountains and rivers. Therefore, his artistic expression reached a high level of skill and gradually transitioned from unrestrainedness to meticulousness, entering a new stage of art. Now, I am honored to introduce some of his recent works. The seal "Lin Xiao" imitates the style of Ding Yi. The three characters contain two 木 (wood) radicals and are symmetrical. If the composition is not proper, it will become rigid. Now, it is written in a staggered manner, which is not only lively and varied but also extremely beautiful. "Wan Xian Yi" uses many curves and oblique strokes in the zhuwen (seal script), showing vitality and refinement. "Mu Shi Zhi Zhu" pairs two larger characters with two smaller characters, arranging them in lines to fill the spaces, creating a compact and natural effect. The seals are ancient, diligent, lush, and refined, demonstrating ingenuity and reaching a transformative realm. It is said that Speaker Pan and others have urged him to stay in Shanghai and sell his carvings. He has set up a receiving point at Tong Gu Zhai, No. 59 Jiangxi Middle Road.</p>
<h3>On the Science of Marriage</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>The news that Hujiang University plans to add "Courtship" and "Marriage" courses in the next semester has unexpectedly attracted the attention and approval of people in society. Standing from the perspective of a Hujiang student, I feel sincerely happy and am willing to strive to make it a reality.</p>
<p>First of all, let me report on the debate among the faculty and staff of Hujiang University regarding the establishment of these two courses:</p>
<p>On the evening of March 11th, Mrs. President Ling chaired the meeting and announced the issue for discussion. Professors who supported the establishment of "Courtship" and "Marriage" courses expressed positive opinions, emphasizing the unreasonableness of feudal, transactional marriages. However, modern young people often lack reasonable guidance when seeking a partner or after marriage, leading to various marital tragedies in society. Therefore, in addition to training "specialists," university courses should also pay attention to the cultivation of "generalists." It is necessary to have "Courtship" and "Marriage" courses so that young people can receive due guidance, enlightenment, and understanding regarding their own lifelong大事.</p>
<p>Professors who opposed the establishment of the two courses analyzed human courtship and marriage from scientific and religious perspectives, believing that marriage, from a biological point of view, is merely a way to reproduce life and perpetuate the race. Love, from a religious point of view, is governed by God and cannot be taught by teachers. Therefore, regarding the way of "Courtship" and "Marriage," the conclusion is that it is unnecessary to teach, impossible to teach, and no one can teach.</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman asked all faculty and staff to vote, and the result was 34 votes to 19, passing the motion to include "Courtship" and "Marriage" in the curriculum. Both the president and the academic dean voted in favor.</p>
<p>Now, what we think is worth discussing is: If these two courses are formally established, will they be required for every student? Or will they be elective courses and belong to which department?</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, it is not necessary to make them required. Fortunately, it concerns one's own life, and students will be eager to take them, thus avoiding conflict with the Ministry of Education's principle of reducing required credits. If they are elective courses, it would naturally be most appropriate to belong to the Department of Sociology, because this is originally a social problem!</p>
<p>I remember that in a recent "Free Talk" column, Mr. Wu Yong's article "The Socialization of Universities" was published. Therefore, this new measure of Hujiang University is undoubtedly the best expression of response. May this new education spread and grow in our country, and we bless ourselves and the students of the next generation.</p>
<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>A glass of wine plus a glass of water is equal to two glasses of water plus one glass of wine, leaving no wine at all.</p>
<p>People love to dream. Young people dream of tomorrow, and old people dream of yesterday, so "today" is the most hateful day.</p>
<p>If everyone knew their own weight, the balance of life would not tilt, because they would understand which side should hold more weight.</p>
<h3>"Impossible"?</h3>
<p>— Ruzi</p>
<p>The world-renowned composer Liszt's personality was originally very amiable, but when he felt it necessary, he would arbitrarily do things that were extremely inhuman.</p>
<p>One day, a young composer brought his "proud work" to seek his advice. Liszt saw that his lyrics were extremely stiff and the melody was very disharmonious, so he pointed out the worst part and said to him, "This is impossible in music."</p>
<p>"But," the young man said proudly, "I have accomplished it."</p>
<p>Liszt smiled coldly, dipped his pen in ink, and then arbitrarily splashed it on his coat. "This is also possible," he said, "but it should not be done."</p>
<p>After saying that, he ran out to buy the young composer a new coat.</p>
<h3>Borrowing Books</h3>
<p>— Tan Ke</p>
<p>Borrowing books from collectors often results in cold treatment. Therefore, collectors are often regarded as "miserly ghosts" and "book-guarding slaves." In fact, collectors also have their own difficulties. For example, precious books might be lost, pages might be torn or soiled... They worry about all of this. Whether this is excessive worry need not be discussed in detail. Let's take a look at the books in the library.</p>
<p>When you walk in, you see that most of the covers are already very worn, and the corners are curled. When you flip through the book, you will find the words "Read by so-and-so on such-and-such date" on the flyleaf, and the sentences next to them have been underlined. I don't know whether the library deliberately collects old books.</p>
<p>In my hometown, there are a few sayings about borrowing and returning books, saying, "Books should not be borrowed, once borrowed, they will be relied upon, even if you ask for them back quickly, the cover has been torn." I don't think this is an exaggeration. Although our country is a land of etiquette, and the ancient sages and philosophers have left behind many clear instructions, such as "extending oneself to others" and "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," these have all become slogans. Many talkers, many understanders, but few doers. Especially when it comes to public property, there is a sense of indifference. The same goes for other people's things. There are not many who truly cherish them. "If it's broken, I'll just pay for it, what does it matter?" So, after borrowing a book, they stuff it in their pocket, the corners are creased, and the paper is softened. Anyway, it's not damaged, and the librarian doesn't say anything. Who cares! In this way, the book goes from new to old, to broken, to incomplete.</p>
<p>Then, how can we criticize the book collector for not lending out his books? Our "reputation" has been ruined!</p>
<h3>Wandering Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Wandering at Sea (116)</p>
<p>Zhu Zhai saw her attitude and wanted to follow her inside, but he was afraid that there would be her girlfriend inside, and she would scold him again in front of her face, which would be even more embarrassing. So, he just walked back and forth in the room. After about half an hour, seeing that Feng Sheng still hadn't come out, he couldn't bear it anymore and stood outside the room, calling out in a low voice, "Feng Sheng! Please come out, I have a few words to tell you." Feng Sheng responded from inside the room, "You go away! We have nothing to say." Zhu Zhai said, "Don't be angry, what I said today concerns the affairs of both of us." Feng Sheng still responded from inside the room, "There's nothing to talk about between us. We have already made an agreement, and everything will be handled according to the agreement. If you really can't do it, I will never force you. Don't worry." Zhu Zhai said, "Not for this, there is something else, come out and we can talk face to face." Feng Sheng seemed very angry and responded loudly, "No need! No need!" Then someone was heard quietly persuading her, and after a good while of murmuring, Feng Sheng said from inside the room with resentment, "How annoying!" As she said that, she had already walked out. Zhu Zhai saw her come out, with a smile all over his face, and first let her sit down, but Feng Sheng stood there, with her hands on her hips, and asked fiercely, "What do you want? Speak!" Zhu Zhai saw her face full of anger, that kind of cold look that was unbearable, and he still endured a stomach full of闷气 and said, "Sit down and we'll talk." Feng Sheng said, "No, if you have something to say, say it, if you don't have anything to say, please leave." Zhu Zhai said, "Feng Sheng! Why are you so impolite to me this time? I think, apart from the fact that your monthly fee for these two months was not sent on time due to inconvenience, there is nothing else that I'm sorry about!" Feng Sheng said, "You came just to explain these few sentences? Or is there something else? I didn't ask you for it when you couldn't send the money on time every month, and I've thought about it for a long time. I can't always rely on others alone. Now I rely on you to give me money every month. One day, if your circumstances don't allow it, would I really sue you? I would never do that." Zhu Zhai said, "I'm not here today to clarify this. I want to go home, will you allow me to?" Feng Sheng said, "Go home! This is impossible." Zhu Zhai said, "You can trust me, this time I'm going home to be safe and keep myself, and I will never do anything reckless outside." Feng Sheng said, "Whether you do anything reckless outside has nothing to do with me."</p>
<h3>Three Swimming Pools</h3>
<p>— Dao Xian</p>
<p>A nouveau riche was boasting to his friends about the three swimming pools in his new house. The friend asked him, "Why do you need three swimming pools?"</p>
<p>"One is cold water," the owner replied, "one is hot water, and one has no water at all."</p>
<p>"I can understand the cold water and the hot water," his friend said, "why do you need one without any water?"</p>
<p>"My friend, you don't know," the nouveau riche said sadly, "I have so many old friends who don't know how to swim."</p>
