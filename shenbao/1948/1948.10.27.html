<p>〔中央社北平廿六日電〕中宣部副部長陶希聖，日前來平，記者廿六日訪陶氏於旅舍，詢以有關當前經濟問題之意見，陶氏稱：政院今日所勵行者，仍爲八一九財政經濟緊急處分令所頒行之辦法及補充辦法，對於限便政策，仍繼續堅持，人民生活必需品在京·滬兩市將實行配給，對平。津兩市正積極籌劃，其食糧之補充，將於原有之麵粉配給，尤不使其有匱乏之虞。陶氏說明上海工業原料甚爲充裕，就現存者言，至少三個月內必不致有缺乏，政府已劃出外匯，並鼓勵民間自備外匯向國外訂購原料，俾七個月後繼續供應一般工業之用。上海工業成品存量極豐，各地同業公會取得地方政府證明，卽可如歡批發。論及金融狀况，陶氏稱：上海自經管制實施以來，最爲良好之現象，卽爲銀行存款激增，利率降低，使一般生產事業易於周轉，最近若干地方利率上升，上海資金有西流之勢，政府正在籌劃適當之辦法，以爲調劑，務使此良好現象繼續維持。記者詢以經濟學家有主張凍結存款者，是否可以實行，陶氏謂，以余所知，座談會乃自由交換意見，無何種決定，卽就報紙所傳而言，銀行存款增加，利率降低，爲生產事業發展之條件，凍結存款之說，不合事實需要。在八一九前，游資集中投機囤積，銀行存款為數極少，至八一九後，銀行始以存款為貸放，回覆其業務之常軌，政府自當予以保障。記者最後詢以總統在平接見各大學校長及敎授，是否對經濟措施有所決定。陶氏稱：總統每次來平，必頻邀大學校長及敎授，聽取其有關政治經濟及敎育之意見，此次亦非例外，然經濟政策之訂定與執行，則爲行政院之所有事也。</p>

<h3 id="c20">讀北平各敎授的為民請命書 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>北平各大學敎授聯名上總統及翁院長書，對於當前經濟上的種種困難及補救方法，多所闡發；其全文已載昨日本報。歸納起來，意見書的要點有二：（一）爲嚴格實施硬性與普徧的限價，而沒有輔以種種必要的條件和辦法，認爲無法成功；（二）金圓券的發行額，超過了實際的需要，與現有物資朱能相稱，這當然要發生漲價與黑市現象。而現在各地的搶購風潮，和物資脫節，產銷脫節，城鄉貨物不能交流等種種「人爲的苦難」的情形，俱認爲是以上兩種要點併合起來的產物。這些話，其實都是凡有常識者都能知道，本報社論言之已非一次，現在經過他們與上海市塲沒有直接關係的北平敎授一說，似乎也可使負行政實任的翁院長動容了吧。</p>
<p>北平各敎授根據他們的看法，提出兩個重要建議：（一）是縮小限價的範圍，置重點於民生日用必需品，而任令其他物品仍回復自由交易，讓其自覓自然的水準：這是對於現行的限價辦法，提議加以修正的。（二）是政府應拿出已兌回的金鈔·外匯·到國外去購生活必需品，而仍按「八一九」的限價，配售於民衆；這是對於現行通貨過剩和物資缺乏的補救辦法。</p>
<p>以上這兩種建議，我們都認很充分的理由和必要。因為按諸現實。各地區執行限價的情形，顯然並不一致，有的目前已取消限價而試行議價，有些偏遠地方則根本還沒有實施過限價，而在嚴格執行的都市，究竟因爲範圍太廣，業別太多，更帶着先天性的種種不合理狀態，執行人員雖然十分賣力，嚴密査察，亦終於免不了一部份黑市的存在。前在紡管會時代，所擬統收統購辦法，其範圍只限於花紗布三種，最後亦未能收到預期的效果。可知硬性與普徧的限價，確如原文所說：「不可能的事，是不可能的」。</p>
<p>如果上項建議，能邀中樞採納，只把民生必需品仍行限價，而許其他物品一律開放，准予自由買賣，我們還想補充兩點：所維持的限價，應予酌量調整，消除其不合理的狀態，務使農與工的最低生產成本，和商人的最低利潤，悉予顧全。原文說：「我們不能希望每個人都去作貼錢的經濟行爲」。這句話，恐怕是現在人人要想說的話，亦是實施限價求其有效的根本原則。蔣督導在前日對各業代表的制話中，亦已聲明：限價決定維持，但日用必需品以外之貨物價格，必顧到其生產成本，政府對工商業之合法利益，當予以保障。這個原則，我們希望適用到一切的限價上，卽日用必需品的限價亦不能背乎此原則。此其一。如果限價範圍確予縮小，而准許日用必需品以外之貨物回復自由，則物資流通的情形，當可大加改善，而現行各項限制出境和以物易物的辦法，至少當有一部份不甚適用，或成爲不必要，似宜併予放寬或修正，以期加强物資的交流。此其二。</p>
<p>至於游資充斥這一點，大家已迭經指出，必須迅速地予以消納，卽中央亦未始不在分頭設法，以吸收這項過剩的通貨。原文建議，由政府兌圓的金鈔外匯，到外國去購生活必需品，這自然是一個很好的辦法。但爲吸收過剩的通貨起見，我們以爲：如全部由政府去購買，不如放寬外匯的申請範圍，讓商人去分別購辦，好讓一部份的金圓劵可以回籠。又所購辦的貨品，除民生日用必需品外，並應推廣到一切必需的原料和生產器材，以期增加生產，維持就業，並减少未來的進口額。</p>
<p>這筆金鈔外匯，政府原指充金圓劵的凖備金的，政府對於這項建議，或者不無多少顧慮。但據有關方面　露，現在準備金的總額，平已超過現行的發行量，則移用一部份去購辦外貨，應不生何等影響。况照我們意見，准許商人申請外匯去採辦，則一面流出外匯，一面卽收回等量的金圓劵，與準備金更不生問題。如衆所周知，現在的金圓劵實際還是」種管理通貨。這種通貨是否健全，其關鍵在於管理的是否得當，而並不在於準備金比例的多寡。拿英國來說吧，她已經數次動用過所保有的現金準備，但並不影響其英鎊的價値，可知撥用這項兌回來的金鈔外匯，不論是全部或是一部份，與金圓券的準備實在沒有多大關係。原文說明；「因爲準備並不兌現，……在這種情形下，卽使有加倍的準備，亦與金圓券的價値無關」，這更說得十分透澈　了。</p>
<p>除了讓述兩種主要的建議以外，原文還主張：（一）按限價實行按照人口全面配給主要生活品；（二）加稅，公用事業作合理的加價，以貼補配給。這兩點却不無商榷的餘地。</p>
<p>先說全面配給主要生活品，是否能眞正做好，大成問題。因爲我國幅員廣闊，人口衆多，各地的智識水凖，又高下不一，而政府的行政效率，尤其未遠到理想。所謂「按人口配給主要生活品」，在理論上固甚圓滿萬分，而在實行時可以意想到的問題太多。縱使配給範圍只限於都市，（其實此已不甚公平），在最低的日用品數量，政府如尙未能按期完全供給時，究竟煞市能否因計口配給而完全消滅，這也是任何人所不能保證的。如費了九牛二虎之力，趕辦計口配給，而仍不能「全面」，仍不能消滅黑市，將如之何？</p>
<p>至於加稅，已經部份地實施，加價，亦正在互相商討中。這種措施，如確由於財政上的迫切需要，則原在「八一九」明令緊急措施的辦法範圍以內，我們似可毋庸多費討論。但，倘如原文所說，旨在貼補配給，則關係重大，還値得鄭重硏究。因爲普徧配給，問題太多，已如上文所明，而加稅加價，影響太大，此不難於烟酒等項貨物稅率的提高，刺激一般物價的上漲，而獲得事實上的證明。所以這一項附帶的建議，我們願持保留的態度。</p>
<p>末了，我們還得申明，自幣制改革以來，到今日，似乎已到如何解決困難的階段，所以任何建議，任何補充辦法，凡可以作為討論某礎的，不問來自何方，不但爲人民所關切，想亦爲政府所歡迎。正不必因是北平的建議才覺可採，上海的輿論不足重視。至如修正限價制度和准許金鈔外匯之申請，以吸收過剩的通貨這兩點，我們尤盼望負責當局從速採納，以改善現在的經濟狀況。總之，經管不論採用什麼方法，必須不背「物盡其用，貨暢其流」的原則，當局虛懷探討，當可恍然於挽救經濟危機之道。</p>

<h3 id="c49">蘇聯否決中立國建議　柏林問題仍僵持　西方三強會商下一步驟 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿六日廣播：自蘇外長維辛斯基於廿五日否決六中立國之折衷方案後，柏林問題之僵局益形明顯。消息靈通方面預料，美英法蘇及中立國家將繼續在安理會中進行談判，以期解決柏林糾紛。據悉代理主席勃拉馬格里亞相信西方與蘇聯對柏林問題之見解，經過再度商談後，或仍有調和之可能，因維辛斯茶曾表示：倘能同時確立柏林通貨之適當管制，則蘇聯願解除柏林封鎖。美代表團方面與勃氏持同樣見解，認爲繼續談判仍屬可能，但謂因維辛斯基否決之故，談判或將暫時停頓。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕蘇代表維辛斯基今日在安理會中，坦率拒絕六中立國關於柏林問題之建議，表決時得意料中之九票對二票（卽蘇聯與烏克蘭投反對票）之結果，然根據聯合國憲掌第廿七條第二款，蘇聯之反對票亦卽爲否決票，故主席勃拉馬格里亞惟有宣布建議被否決，聯合國之統計家指出此爲蘇聯第二十七次使用否決權。中立國家當時曾立卽宣佈，彼等將繼續努力以解決此項危機。</p>
<p>〔合眾社巴黎廿五日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾，英外相貝文，及法外長許曼將於廿六晨八時半晤談，以決定彼等之下一步驟。會議之決定或將依照傑塞普之提議，將柏林問題提交聯合國大會，要求大會在全世界面前斥蘇聯和平之破壞者，傳英法兩國並不贊成此點。在安理會散會後，傑賽普吿代理主席勃拉馬格里亞稱，「吾人尙未完了」。勃氏亦謂，渠將召集六中立國於廿六晨舉行會議。維辛斯基在開會前，曾圖使西方盟國接受一項對中立國建議之修正，修正案主旨在於逐步而不立卽解除封鎖，使最後解除全部封鎖之日，卽爲獲致幣制協議之日。西方盟國反對此案，認爲此卽在壓力下進行談判之謂。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕此間政界對蘇聯否決安理會之柏林事件建議案，旣不失望，亦不憂慮。多數評論家指出維辛斯基今並不願與西方三强切實決裂，窺其意顯在爭取時間以待（一）美國選舉總統之結果，此後美國或將宣布對歐之軍事援助；（二）法政府與共黨工會領袖比權量力之結果；（三）蘇聯組織衛星國與東德準備之完成。此後蘇聯或將提出炸彈性之建議，主張完全撤退駐德之佔領軍。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿六日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦代理調人彭契廿六日宣佈，渠已號召巴境南部以色列及埃及兩軍撤退至十月十四日激戰發生前之原陣地。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿六日電〕安理會今晨開會，聽取阿猶雙方互相指斥破壞休戰。首由埃及代表喀却巴發表甚長之演說稱，猶太軍利用休戰機會，藉口其糧食護航隊爲埃及軍攻擊，對尼基夫發動大規模軍事行動，渠宣稱，猶太軍之侵略，係由安理會之無行動，以及猶太軍相信旣成事實可獲致承認而起。</p>
<p>黎巴嫰代表阿曼亦以類似言論强調稱，猶軍進攻尼基夫目的，在佔領此一根據貝那多特計劃須劃歸阿拉伯之領土。阿拉伯各國代表之指斥，由以色列代表艾本反駁稱，埃軍之侵犯巴勒斯坦，係明顯破壞休戰之事實，但當埃及軍事上遭到失敗時，却訴諸安理會。艾本隨後提及安理會曾建議召開談判以商討尼基夫問題稱，尼基夫決拒絕重行陷入該城剛脫出之混亂狀態。在雙方代表辯論之後，主席美代表奧斯汀即發表聲明，謂該會決不受雙方偏見之影響，而有關此一問題之辯論將於廿八日繼續舉行，遂宣佈休會。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕烟台撤退來滬中學生及中小學敎職員眷屬約二千二百人，仍暫住西門路山東同鄉會內，其他同來之難民因在滬多有戚友已分別投奔。流亡學生及敎職員昨日曾推代表分赴督導員辦公處，市政府，社會局及敎育局請予協助解決生活及就學問題，並推烟台市敎會理事中正中學校長趙蘭庭晋京向敎部請願接洽安插。吳市長昨日下午派市府參事李劍華前往山東同鄕會慰問調査，將就各方面予以協助救濟。市救濟委員會自昨日下午起，已出動流動粥車每日前往供應熟粥二次，附近居民亦多踴躍捐助食物或現款。至二千餘學生之就學問題，據悉敎部已準備在浙贛沿綫各地設立聯合中學十所，收容各地流亡學生。該批烟台來滬學生在滬再逗留約一週，卽可分發前往，今日起先開始辦理登記</p>
<p>難民落水比比皆是</p>
<p>記者昨訪率領撤退來滬之烟台參議會議長鄒鑑，據談：此次撤退來滬者爲烟台國華·中正·崇德，崇正，益文，簡師，志孚、眞光八中學學生一千九百人及中小學教職員三百人與敎職員家屬二百人，其中女生約四五百人。彼等係於十二日搭乘安達輪撤離烟台。事先對撤守事曾詢之負責當局，皆未獲答覆。後悉烟台外圍三十里福山之軍隊眷屬撤離，該地四萬難民相繼逃亡烟台，學生乃收拾鋪蓋交涉船隻撤退。是時見沿海碼頭聚集逃亡難民，數約一萬五千人，餐風露宿，等候船隻逃亡。每遇小舢舨等駛近，是曁卽羣相攀登，以致翻船落水，與被逼跳海者比比皆是，沿岸但聞一片哭喊聲，驚心怵目，慘不忍睹。其駕小船出海者，至今多杳無音訊，不知飄浪何處。烟台人口共爲十四萬，撤退逃亡至靑島者約二萬人，市內未發生戰爭，設備完善有全國第二之稱之大機塲與工廠皆未及破壞。</p>
<p>附近居民紛紛捐贈</p>
<p>彼等一行經靑島後仍搭原船來滬，沿途數日未進食，因之有百餘人病倒。船於二十五日午停泊本市虬江碼頭，由港口司令部借予汽車四輛搬送行李學，生則於晚七時徒手步行，於晚十一時抵西門路山東同鄉會，因夜深無人接洽，風雨中卽露宿於院內。彼等因船上多日未食，抵岸後又無食物購得，山東同鄕會附近之馬當路四十一保保長朱荔卿與十七甲甲長吳榮發，自動發動區內居民，燒煮熱粥相贈，二十六日又煮熱粥及鹹菜送予分食，彼等前往致謝時，發覺贈予者有爲街頭擺小攤及踏三輪車者，對同胞此種珍貴之熱忱、深覺感動，至於淚下。現祗望當局能早日解決學生之就學問題，免致荒廢靑年學業。</p>

<p>— 款乃</p>
<p>「喂，廿萬頭單位要戰？」</p>
<p>「啊？」</p>
<p>「配尼西林，刮刮呌貨色。」</p>
<p>我不禁注意了一下。但見一個三十歲左右穿着一套舊洋裝的男子，一手拿着一只半舊的帆布公文包，嘴裏斜掛着半截香烟，正在一個個櫃台上兜賣他的所謂「廿萬頭單位」。櫃台裏的人似乎不感興趣，懶懶的說了一聲「不要！」</p>
<p>我俯了頭在對面一個出賣鐘錢的玻璃櫃裏仔細看着各式手錶，但是，在我的眼鏡的邊上，我似乎看見一個人晃呀免的走近了那個穿洋裝的賣「廿萬頭單位」的人，他們像是不認識的樣子，擦肩而過，可是，一句低低的話淸晰地飄過了我的耳邊：</p>
<p>「啥價鈿？」</p>
<p>我抬起了頭，又看起隔壁櫃上的西藥來。偶然回頭一看，那個出賣「廿萬頭單位」的人已經不見。</p>
<p>我正想問櫃台裏的人有沒有我所急於想買的李施德霖牙膏，然而，又一個人來了，是一個二十二三歲的靑年，全身是美軍剩餘物資—暗綠的短掛，卡其褲，半長統皮鞋，他走上來就是：</p>
<p>「廿萬頭單位要戰？新鮮貨。」。</p>
<p>我看了他一眼，祗見他嘴裏有金牙燦然發光。心裏却在替古人改詩，詩云：「朝捉黃牛，暮捉黃牛，朝捉暮捉，黃牛如故！』</p>
<p>詩興旣消，又向前走去，忽見一大疊大大小小的玻璃（P.astic）碟子，粉紅的，淡綠的，乳白的，頗爲可愛。我就揀了一種尺寸捎大可以盛菜的，問那位攤主要多少錢。</p>
<p>「四十八塊錢！」</p>
<p>他大槪看見我嚇了一跳，就笑着解釋：「四十八塊錢一打，不貴呀！」</p>
<p>我說：「四塊錢一只還不貴嗎？那麽，能不能零碎買幾只呢？」</p>
<p>「不行，我這裏是批發的，要未講打頭，至少半打。」</p>
<p>其實我家裏並無添購菜碟的必要，旣然他這樣說，那麼讓他去「貨賣識家」也好。忽然想起：黃牛與單帮原是「兩位一體」的。</p>
<p>覺得頗爲氣悶，拿了枝香烟出來，點上了火吸了一口。往前一望—對了，果然有人在这裏批貨的，兩個衣服樸素的中年人正打開了旅行包，把一紮一紮的玻璃木梳塞進去。</p>
<p>再走了兩步，好呀，我不是想買李施德霖牙膏嗎？這裏一個櫃台却多的是各種上好牙膏—不但李施德霖，還有固齡玉，還有Colgate，大小齊備，花樣繁多.我就走上去，呌那個櫃台主人拿一管大號的李施德霖牙膏出來。</p>
<p>但是，他給我的答覆却是把臉扳了起來，他的頭突然上仰，他的眼光似乎集中在天花板上的某一個蜘蛛網；然後，他用最冷最冷的聲調幽幽地說道：</p>
<p>「我們這裏是只做批發的！」</p>
<p>這一下却使我頓口無言，回頭就走。想想也實在奇怪：假使我在南京路或霞飛路的百貨公司中發現了我所想買的東西，他們是一定祗肯讓我買一件的，而且還要在身份證上蓋岡章，唯恐我多買，在這裘，却偏又不許我少買！</p>
<p>這裏和南京路之類不同的地方着實不少：譬如說，密斯佛陀牌子的上等化粧品，在南京路商店裏已成罕見之品，但在這裏却是滿坑滿谷；市上難買到的「散利痛」藥片，這裏也到處可見，而且，這裏交易毫無限制，市民證完全用不着，而—八一九的限價似乎也並不存在。</p>
<p>你要知道這是什麽地方嗎？這是南市最大的一家「商塲」，地點適中，附近還有賣酒釀圓子和小籠饅頭的多年老店，有歷史悠久的書塲和茶館，更有馳名遐邇據說是萬試萬靈的算命先生。如果你相信燒香還願的話，那麼這裏也有的是大殿小殿，終年香烟繚繞，善男信女是着實不少的。（十月二十三日記）</p>
<h3 id="c124">談蓋章 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 老丹</p>
<p>不久以前，我曾談述「簽字蓋章」是架牀疊屋般不當，今又聯想到寫信的蓋章了。本來書信的署名，普通的姓名與謹啓（或謹狀，或載拜，或拜啓等），應該是「張三謹啓」連續起來的樣式，如加蓋私章的話，私章是蓋在「三」字與「謹」字的中間墨跡上，或是蓋在「啓」字的下端，這是表示信件寫好之後，纔加蓋圖章的。可是近年以來，有些人，尤其是機關與團體中人，却別有的一套，他們多是姓名與謠啓之間，離開一個空位，來蓋圖章。甚至有些應酬的題件，也是照樣的姓名與敬題之間，離開一格的蓋章。這不知是誰的作俑，弄出這樣的非驢非馬的書啓蓋章。現在竟然在機關，在社會上流行着，以訛傳訛的習非成是了，眞是豈有此理。或者他們以爲圖章應該給它一個地位來表現，故想出這一種方法，離關空格來蓋圖章。這些話，自然不成爲理由。我們看那一切文書上的機關印信，必定蓋在「中華民國」的「國」字的下方，卽「三十七年十月二十四日」（假託的日子）等字的墨跡之上，絕沒有把「中華民國」與「三十七年十月二十四日」之間，預先空白了一個印信的長短地位來蓋印的。因爲名章或印信，讀在名下或年干之上，是屬一種「關防」的意義，不然，儘可先在信牋上或公文紙上預先蓋章，那是流弊太多了。一般檢騐文書的眞僞，騐察圖章或印信是否印在字跡上，抑或字是寫布印色上，一先一後，這是很有關係的。</p>
<p>談到蓋印，又聯想到一件故事來；革命軍北伐時期，簡又文接任山東鹽運使，他沒有班底，署中職員，多屬舊人。當第一張佈吿繕就要貼出時，文書組主任拿了佈吿來請示應該蓋什麼印章。說穿了，這是考一考新官是否懂得公事。那時簡聽着實在也不能够指示他應該所蓋的什麽印章。可是簡計急智生，立卽板起面孔的說：「你們究竟辦什麼事？這些都要來問我！」這位文書組主任碰了一個釘子，知道簡是不好惹的。因爲簡所答的，使他無所再問，只得連聲「是！是！」而去。</p>
<p>某次，在一個書畫展覽會上，看到一張姓陳所畫的畫，喪角鈐了一個「龍眠家法」的圖章。這個畫家，如果他不是寫明是姓陳的，稍有點常識的人看到了必說繪畫的是姓李，因爲龍眠是姓李。這是不求甚解的人所幹的事，等於在姓名之下離開空格蓋章的一樣的笑話。</p>

<p>本月份美國出版的「雜誌文摘一上有量樣一段：</p>
<p>「中國人有這樣的諺語：如果你想得到一小時的快樂，你可以飲酒；如果你想得到三天的快樂，你可以結婚；如果你想得到八天的快樂，你可以把你所養的豬宰了大吃一陣。你如果想快樂一世，那麼你應當闢一個花園，自已來做園丁。」</p>

<p>— 碩甫</p>
<p>俗諺云：「有錢能使鬼推磨。」這幾時似須另作別解。卽使任何人身邊帶了足够的錢，假使你不能够通過金錢以外的其他關係，尤其是人事關係，你買不到一件花呢衣料，白色襯衫，絲襪，未開聽的罐頭食物，一塊以上的肥皂，甚至據菜塲回來的主婦們說，買不到猪肉，牛肉，甚至一枚鴨蛋。我國素以農業國著稱，食物恐慌與缺乏的問題，似乎還不至於閙到英國以洋山芋爲主要佐餐品那樣的嚴重。</p>
<p>街上的人，也特別擁擠。白天本來留在家中的人，好像全都到街上來了。彷彿要比以前加倍大的上海市，才能容納他們。各色各樣的店舖內，全擁塞了人。一切都是Rush，大家搶購襯衫，肥皂，牙膏，餅乾，糖果……大家搶乘街車，爲的是可以乘早趕到搶購的目的地去。</p>
<p>人生的從容，至少暫時已經過去了，雖然我是愛一些從容的。比較可悲的現象是：大家對於爭取智識，似乎並不熱心。我聽見許多人說，這年頭謀生不暇，那裏有空閑工夫去讀書！事實上，這些發牢騷的人，並不是整天在爲衣食奔走，却以他們很多的空閑，在朋友家中打牌，上館子喝酒，或在跳舞塲中消磨了。可喜的是：市上書肄內和街頭書攤上的書籍，還很豐富，定價也沒有到瘋狂的程度，可以供我輩隨意瀏覽，擇尤選購。</p>
<p>假使我們勇於正視現實，我們不得不承認一般人民對於貨幣的看法，不但失去了價値儲藏的功用，而且失去充作交易媒介的意義。這問題分析起來也許很複雜。一切的措施與辦法都是爲好的方面着想，其間還寓有私利思想與國家觀念之爭，個人求生存與保全財產等基本希望在內。</p>
<p>我常常想、如果幣制的規劃，能够換一個辦法，譬如獨立戰爭期間的美國、第一次世界大戰後的德國等，都曾閙過惡性通貨膨脹，卒能安然渡過。在嚴密的管理下，以能取得人民信仰的實物爲貨幣的準備，並以兌換實物，維持貨幣的信用，當可緩和搶購的風潮。經濟學者曾創綜合物品本位說，其說雖較難實施，但可供參考。</p>
<p>等到貨幣能充分發揮它的功能時，我想「有錢能使鬼推磨」，仍將爲多數人奉爲眞理，因爲人類對於金錢萬能的傳統看法，太根深蒂固了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Major Battle Unfolds in Western Liaoning: Battlefield Extends from the East Bank of the Daling River in the West to the Banks of the Xun River in the East; Enemy Forces Employ Up to Seven Columns <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 26th] The major decisive battle between the Northeast National Army and the main force of the bandits, which has been brewing for many days, has finally unfolded in western Liaoning. The battlefield stretches from the east bank of the Daling River in the west to the banks of the Liao River in the east. This vast area includes important cities such as Beizhen, Goubangzi, Heishan, Xinlitun, and Xinmin, and may extend to Tieling and Kaiyuan. The success or failure of the Northeast hinges on this one battle. The bandits have mobilized seven columns, numbered 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10, along with the Mongolian Cavalry First Division, the Second Independent Division of Southern Liaoning, and an artillery brigade. The bandits recklessly hope to encircle the National Army's westward advance units, but a certain general on the front line immediately commanded the various units to implement a counter-encirclement, launching a fierce fight. The decisive battle has been going on for three days, with the first two days being a prelude. The 26th turned into a fierce battle. Initially, the bandits' 8th and 10th Columns enticed the National Army to penetrate deep into the Heishan area, while the 3rd and 6th Columns counterattacked from the Zhangwu area towards Xinlitun, and the 5th Column launched a flanking attack eastward from the Fuxin area, hoping to encircle the National Army. Their First Column was at Dahushan, hoping to cut off the National Army's connection with southern Liaoning, and the 4th Column had just crossed the Daling River from Jinzhou to participate in the decisive battle. The Mongolian cavalry and others were responsible for surprise attacks. The National Army, on the other hand, is fighting steadily, using "cat-and-mouse" tactics to strive for victory. There is fierce fighting in Zheng'anbao northeast of Beizhen, Sifangtai, Xiaonengwang north of Heishan, Songtun, Yangtun, Litun northwest of Heishan, and areas north of Goubangzi and Dahushan. In addition, the battle at Daheishan between Xinlitun and Xinmin is even more intense. The Air Force has been repeatedly dispatched to heavily bomb the bandit crowds, with even more planes flying back and forth on the 26th, causing heavy casualties to the bandits. Du Yuming is also constantly traveling back and forth to command the front and rear, and is in contact with Wei Lihuang. The bandit forces harassing the area between Panjin and Tieling are the bandits' Third Independent Division. On the evening of the 25th, they re-invaded Lianshishan Railway Station. Fierce fighting is ongoing on the 26th. In the areas east and southeast of Tieling, three independent divisions of bandits have infiltrated from the Changchun area. The National Army is encircling and suppressing them.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, This Newspaper, 25th] (Delayed) The Northeast National Army is developing according to plan, but recently it has placed greater emphasis on capturing the main force of the bandits. The bandits, on the other hand, are sniffing out loopholes in the National Army, hoping to strike at the National Army. A unit of the army corps advancing westward from Shenyang withdrew from Zhangwu on the 23rd to pursue the bandit crowds. Also, a small unit of the National Army that entered Heishan has also left the city again to pursue and suppress the bandits in the nearby area. Another unit of the National Army has come to encircle them, and there was fierce fighting on the 25th. More than 3,000 bandits in Fuxin fled eastward, attempting to counterattack Xinlitun. In addition, the bandits' Twelfth Column crossed the Liao River westward from Kaiyuan, also attempting to infiltrate the Xinlitun area. The National Army has strengthened its defenses in Xinlitun and Xinmin. The bandit independent divisions that went south from Changchun have now mostly arrived in Siping. Also: More than 1,000 bandits from Xin Kaiyuan sneaked into Liaohaitun, Tukouzi, and the area north of Daxunhe, 10 kilometers south of Tieling, on the morning of the 24th, but were repelled by the defending troops. The bandits south of Tieling were repelled and are now entrenched in the mountainous area east of that area, with a tendency to make a comeback. The bandits' intention is to cut off traffic between Tieling and Shenyang. A large army has rushed to encircle and suppress them on the 25th.</p>

According to the Suppression Headquarters: (1) The National Army's mobile suppression units have been active in the eastern and western areas of Liangcheng and Helingeer counties for days. On the 24th, Liangcheng County Magistrate Qiao Hankui led his team to surround the supply station and guard post of the bandits' First Column in Jiuguquan, Beishan, and Yuanbaodian north of Liangcheng, capturing more than 500 bandits and seizing a large amount of supplies.

On the 24th, only a small number of bandits entered the city, setting fire to and burning down several agency buildings. The bandits' Eighth Column, which is currently harassing the eastern and southern parts of Sui, is composed of mixed units such as the Sui-Mongolian Military Region's Jinbei Brigade and the Suidong Brigade, and their combat effectiveness is particularly weak. They are currently being mopped up by local teams. According to reliable information from the military, the eastern reinforcement has arrived in Taolin and Jining, and the southern route has crossed Youyu and Zuoyun. It is generally believed that the annihilation battle in Sui and Bao may begin in the near future between Sa County and Tuoketuo County. On the 25th, the morale of the citizens of Guisui was very good. Businesses have returned to their former state, and prices have shown a significant decline.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Economic Resources, Agriculture and Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, the Finance and Food Administration Committee, and the Internal Affairs and Land Administration Committee of the Control Yuan held a joint meeting on the morning of the 26th to review the current economic situation and resolved to list facts such as currency inflation, production reduction, hoarding of goods, loose credit, and soaring black market prices, and submit a corrective proposal to the Executive Yuan, urging it to quickly seek effective cessation of these serious phenomena. The text of the corrective proposal has been entrusted to five members, Zhang Jianzhong, Wu Dayu, Yuan Qinghui, Zhang Dinghua, and Tang Honglie, to draft. The content will be based on the corrective proposal proposed by Zhang Jianzhong in the joint meeting and will be supplemented by summarizing the opinions of the members who spoke at the meeting. The plan is to formally submit the proposal to the Executive Yuan before the 29th.</p>
<p>The joint meeting was chaired by Zhu Zongliang. More than 30 members attended, and the speakers were very enthusiastic, which fully reflected the Supervisory Committee's emphasis on the current economic situation. Zhang Jianzhong's original proposal pointed out that the price limit system has not been fully and thoroughly implemented, and the price of raw materials has risen above the selling price of finished products, resulting in a contraction in production. Therefore, he advocated abolishing the price limit and changing to negotiated prices. Zhang Dinghua, Yuan Qinghui, and others opposed negotiated prices, believing that prices would become even more uncontrollable after the price limit was lifted. Yuan Qinghui believed that the government should allocate a huge amount of foreign exchange to resell to manufacturers to purchase industrial raw materials, which would promote production and contract currency supply. Zhang Dinghua pointed out that raising the prices of state-owned enterprises and increasing tax rates would stimulate prices, and the government should consider it carefully. Wang Baoshi praised the concrete opinions put forward in the "Petition for the People" by seventeen professors in Beiping and advocated that prices should not be limited except for daily necessities.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 26th] At the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 26th, the Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed the examination report on the Executive Yuan's consultation on the resolution of the U.S. Senate regarding the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty Protocol, requesting review so as to order compliance. It agreed to retain the provisions related to the protection of translation rights in Item 5, Paragraph C of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty Protocol. The government and the United States will mutually submit ratification instruments. The full text of the resolution is as follows: "The Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation signed in Nanjing on November 4, 35th year, has been resolved by the former Legislative Yuan on November 9 of the same year to be approved and has been approved by the former National Government on November 11. If the provisions of Item 5, Paragraph C of the Protocol attached to the treaty are suspended from taking effect in accordance with the U.S. reservation, the rights regarding literary and artistic works in the third sentence of Article 9 of the treaty shall still be interpreted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Sino-U.S. Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed in Shanghai on October 8, 1903. This can be agreed to, and the government will exchange ratification instruments with the United States in accordance with this understanding. However, the purpose of literary and artistic works is to spread culture, and it is essential to enable people who need to use languages other than the original language of the work to read the translation of the work in their own language, which is beneficial to the effective spread of culture. Therefore, in the future, if both parties believe that it is necessary and prepare to negotiate to improve the relationship of copyright, the government should still conduct negotiations in accordance with the spirit of Article 11 of the Sino-U.S. Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1903."</p>

<h3 id="e15">Tao Xisheng's Speech in Beiping: Government Decides to Order Raw Materials from Abroad; Plans Appropriate Measures to Regulate Funds <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, came to Beiping a few days ago. A reporter interviewed Tao at the hotel on the 26th and asked for his opinion on the current economic problems. Tao said: What the Executive Yuan is promoting today is still the methods and supplementary methods promulgated by the 819 Financial and Economic Emergency Measures Order. It will continue to adhere to the policy of limited prices. People's daily necessities will be rationed in Beijing and Shanghai. It is actively planning for Beiping and Tianjin, and the replenishment of food will be supplemented by the existing flour rationing, so that there will be no shortage. Tao explained that the raw materials for Shanghai's industry are very abundant. Judging from the existing ones, there will be no shortage for at least three months. The government has allocated foreign exchange and encouraged private individuals to prepare their own foreign exchange to order raw materials from abroad, so that they can continue to supply general industries seven months later. The inventory of Shanghai's industrial finished products is extremely abundant. Trade associations from various places can obtain proof from the local government and approve wholesale sales as desired. Regarding the financial situation, Tao said: The best phenomenon in Shanghai since the implementation of controls has been the sharp increase in bank deposits and the reduction of interest rates, which makes it easier for general production businesses to turn around. Recently, interest rates in some places have risen, and funds in Shanghai have a tendency to flow westward. The government is planning appropriate measures to regulate them to ensure that this good phenomenon continues. When asked by the reporter whether the proposition of freezing deposits advocated by economists can be implemented, Tao said that as far as he knows, the symposium is a free exchange of opinions and there is no decision. As far as the news reports are concerned, the increase in bank deposits and the reduction of interest rates are conditions for the development of production businesses. The statement of freezing deposits does not meet the actual needs. Before 819, floating funds concentrated on speculation and hoarding, and the number of bank deposits was extremely small. After 819, banks began to use deposits for lending and returned to the normal track of their business. The government should protect them. Finally, the reporter asked whether the President had made any decisions on economic measures when he met with the presidents and professors of various universities in Beiping. Tao said: Every time the President comes to Beiping, he will frequently invite university presidents and professors to listen to their opinions on politics, economy, and education. This time is no exception. However, the formulation and implementation of economic policies are all matters of the Executive Yuan.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e20">On the Petition for the People from Professors in Beiping <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The professors of various universities in Beiping jointly submitted a letter to the President and Premier Weng, elaborating on the current economic difficulties and remedial measures. The full text was published in yesterday's newspaper. In summary, the main points of the opinion letter are two: (1) Strictly implementing rigid and universal price controls without supplementing them with necessary conditions and methods is deemed impossible to succeed; (2) The issuance of gold yuan exceeds actual needs and is not commensurate with existing materials, which naturally leads to price increases and black market phenomena. The current buying spree in various regions, the disconnection of goods and materials, the separation of production and sales, and the inability of goods to circulate between urban and rural areas are all deemed to be the products of the combination of the above two key points. These words are actually knowable to anyone with common sense, and the editorial of this newspaper has said them more than once. Now, after being said by the professors in Beiping, who have no direct relationship with the Shanghai market, it seems that it may also move Premier Weng, who bears the actual administrative responsibility.</p>
<p>Based on their views, the professors in Beiping put forward two important suggestions: (1) Reduce the scope of price controls, focusing on daily necessities for the people, while allowing other items to return to free trade and find their natural level: this is a proposal to amend the current price control measures. (2) The government should take out the gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange that have been redeemed and go abroad to purchase daily necessities, which will still be distributed to the public at the "August 19" price limit: this is a remedy for the current surplus of currency and lack of materials.</p>
<p>We believe that both of the above suggestions have sufficient reasons and necessity. Because according to reality, the implementation of price controls in various regions is obviously inconsistent. Some have already cancelled price controls and are trying out negotiated pricing, while some remote areas have not even implemented price controls at all. In cities with strict enforcement, because the scope is too wide, there are too many industries, and there are also various inherent unreasonable states, although the enforcement personnel are very hardworking and closely investigating, it is still impossible to avoid the existence of a part of the black market. In the era of the Textile Control Commission, the unified collection and purchase method was limited to three kinds of cotton yarn and cloth, and in the end, it failed to achieve the expected results. It can be seen that rigid and universal price controls are indeed as the original text says: "The impossible is impossible."</p>
<p>If the above suggestion can be adopted by the central government, only keeping the price controls on daily necessities for the people, and allowing other items to be opened up across the board and allowed to be traded freely, we would like to add two points: the maintained price controls should be appropriately adjusted to eliminate their unreasonable state, so that the minimum production costs of agriculture and industry, and the minimum profits of merchants, are all taken into account. The original text says: "We cannot expect everyone to engage in economic behavior that loses money." This sentence is probably what everyone wants to say now, and it is also the fundamental principle for implementing price controls and seeking effectiveness. In his speech to the representatives of various industries the other day, Supervisor Jiang also stated that the price controls will be maintained, but the prices of goods other than daily necessities must take into account their production costs, and the government will guarantee the legitimate interests of industry and commerce. We hope that this principle will be applied to all price controls, that is, the price controls on daily necessities cannot deviate from this principle either. This is the first point. If the scope of price controls is indeed reduced, and goods other than daily necessities are allowed to return to freedom, then the circulation of materials can be greatly improved, and the current various restrictions on exit and barter methods, at least a part of them will not be very applicable, or become unnecessary, and it seems that they should be relaxed or revised in order to strengthen the exchange of materials. This is the second point.</p>
<p>As for the point that excess capital is rampant, everyone has repeatedly pointed out that it must be quickly eliminated, and the central government has also not failed to find ways to absorb this excess currency. The original text suggested that the government use the redeemed gold notes and foreign exchange to purchase daily necessities from foreign countries, which is naturally a very good method. However, in order to absorb excess currency, we believe that if the government does all the purchasing, it is better to relax the scope of foreign exchange applications and allow merchants to purchase separately, so that a part of the gold yuan can be recovered. In addition to daily necessities for the people, the purchased goods should also be extended to all necessary raw materials and production equipment, in order to increase production, maintain employment, and reduce future import quotas.</p>
<p>The government originally designated this gold banknote foreign exchange as a reserve for gold yuan. The government may have some concerns about this suggestion. However, according to relevant parties, the total amount of reserves now exceeds the current amount of issuance, so transferring a part of it to purchase foreign goods should not have any impact. Moreover, according to our opinion, allowing merchants to apply for foreign exchange to purchase will cause foreign exchange to flow out on one hand, and recover an equivalent amount of gold yuan on the other hand, so there will be no problem with the reserves. As everyone knows, the current gold yuan is actually still a kind of managed currency. Whether this currency is sound depends on whether the management is proper, and not on the proportion of reserves. Take the United Kingdom as an example, she has used the cash reserves she holds several times, but it does not affect the value of her pound, so it can be seen that appropriating this redeemed gold banknote foreign exchange, whether in whole or in part, really does not have much relationship with the gold yuan reserves. The original text states; "Because the reserves are not cashed, ... in this case, even if there is a double reserve, it has nothing to do with the value of the gold yuan," which is even more thoroughly stated.</p>
<p>In addition to the two main suggestions described above, the original text also advocates: (1) implement a comprehensive allocation of major necessities of life according to population based on price controls; (2) increase taxes and reasonably increase the prices of public utilities to subsidize the allocation. These two points are open to discussion.</p>
<p>First, it is a question whether the comprehensive allocation of major necessities of life can be truly done well. Because China is vast, with a large population, and the level of knowledge in various places is also uneven, and the government's administrative efficiency is especially far from ideal. The so-called "allocation of major necessities of life according to population" is of course very satisfactory in theory, but there are too many problems that can be imagined when it is implemented. Even if the scope of allocation is limited to urban areas (in fact, this is not very fair), when the government has not been able to completely supply the minimum amount of daily necessities on time, whether the black market can be completely eliminated due to the allocation by head is something that no one can guarantee. If a great deal of effort is spent on handling allocation by head, and it still cannot be "comprehensive" and cannot eliminate the black market, what will happen?</p>
<p>As for tax increases, they have already been partially implemented, and price increases are also being discussed with each other. If these measures are indeed due to urgent financial needs, then they are within the scope of the "August 19" order for emergency measures, and it seems that we do not need to spend much time discussing them. However, if, as the original text says, the aim is to subsidize the allocation, then the relationship is significant, and it is still worth studying carefully. Because there are too many problems with universal allocation, as stated above, and the impact of tax increases and price increases is too great. This is not difficult to obtain factual proof by stimulating the general price increase by raising the tax rates on goods such as tobacco and alcohol. Therefore, we are willing to take a reserved attitude towards this additional suggestion.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also state that since the currency reform, it seems that we have reached the stage of how to solve the difficulties today. Therefore, any suggestion or supplementary method that can be used as a basis for discussion, no matter where it comes from, is not only of concern to the people, but also welcomed by the government. It is not necessary to think that only the suggestions of Beiping are worth adopting, and the public opinion of Shanghai is not worth paying attention to. As for the two points of revising the price control system and allowing the application of gold banknote foreign exchange to absorb excess currency, we especially hope that the responsible authorities will adopt them as soon as possible to improve the current economic situation. In short, no matter what method is used, it must not go against the principle of "making the best use of things and facilitating the flow of goods". The authorities should humbly explore and can suddenly understand the way to save the economic crisis.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Ministry of Industry and Commerce News: Upon investigation, the "yard," "pound," and other units of the Anglo-American system of weights and measures do not conform to the regulations of our national weights and measures law and were long ago ordered to be banned. The year before last, a unification of weights and measures used in major enterprises across the country was carried out. The Central Bureau of Standards was instructed to send personnel to major cities such as Peiping, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou to assist local weights and measures authorities in actively carrying out this task. For example, gasoline, which was previously calculated in Anglo-American gallons, has gradually been converted to liters. Cotton yarn, which was previously calculated in Anglo-American pounds, has now been converted to kilograms. However, it has been found that woolen textile factories still use "yard," "pound," and other units of the Anglo-American system to calculate their products, which does not comply with the law and should be banned. The Construction Bureaus and Social Affairs Bureaus of all provinces have been notified to instruct the woolen textile industry associations in various localities to urge all woolen textile factories to uniformly convert to units such as "meters" and "kilograms." The Central Bureau of Standards has also been ordered to instruct the weights and measures inspection institutes in various localities to comply with this order.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Soviet Union Vetoes Neutral Nations' Proposal; Berlin Problem Remains Deadlocked; Western Powers Confer on Next Steps <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Paris, 26th (Radio): Since Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky vetoed the compromise proposal of the six neutral nations on the 25th, the deadlock in the Berlin problem has become increasingly apparent. Well-informed sources expect that the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the neutral nations will continue to negotiate in the Security Council in order to resolve the Berlin dispute. It is reported that acting Chairman Brahmagriya believes that after further discussions, there may still be a possibility of reconciliation between the Western and Soviet views on the Berlin problem, as Vyshinsky has stated that if appropriate control of the Berlin currency can be established at the same time, the Soviet Union is willing to lift the Berlin blockade. The US delegation shares Brahmagriya's view that continued negotiations are still possible, but notes that negotiations may be temporarily suspended due to Vyshinsky's veto.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 25th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky frankly rejected the six neutral nations' proposal on the Berlin problem in the Security Council today. The vote resulted in an expected 9 votes to 2 (with the Soviet Union and Ukraine casting opposing votes). However, according to Article 27, Paragraph 2 of the United Nations Charter, the Soviet Union's opposing vote is also a veto, so Chairman Brahmagriya had no choice but to announce that the proposal had been vetoed. United Nations statisticians pointed out that this was the 27th time the Soviet Union had used its veto power. The neutral nations immediately announced that they would continue to strive to resolve this crisis.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 25th] US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will meet at 8:30 a.m. on the 26th to decide on their next steps. The decision of the meeting may be to submit the Berlin problem to the United Nations General Assembly, as suggested by Jessup, and demand that the General Assembly condemn the Soviet Union as a disruptor of peace in front of the entire world. It is rumored that Britain and France do not support this point. After the Security Council adjourned, Jessup told acting Chairman Brahmagriya, "We are not finished yet." Brahmagriya also stated that he would convene a meeting of the six neutral nations on the morning of the 26th. Before the meeting, Vyshinsky attempted to have the Western allies accept an amendment to the neutral nations' proposal. The main aim of the amendment was to gradually, rather than immediately, lift the blockade, so that the date of the final lifting of the entire blockade would be the date of reaching a currency agreement. The Western allies opposed this proposal, believing that this would mean negotiating under pressure.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] Political circles here are neither disappointed nor worried about the Soviet Union's veto of the Security Council's proposal on the Berlin issue. Most commentators point out that Vyshinsky is not willing to completely break with the Western powers at this time. His intention is clearly to buy time to wait for (1) the results of the US presidential election, after which the US may announce military aid to Europe; (2) the results of the French government's power struggle with the communist trade union leaders; and (3) the completion of the Soviet Union's organization of satellite states and preparations for East Germany. After this, the Soviet Union may propose a bombshell proposal, advocating the complete withdrawal of occupying forces stationed in Germany.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] United Nations Acting Mediator for Palestine, Bunche, announced on the 26th that he had called on the Israeli and Egyptian armies in southern Palestine to withdraw to their original positions before the outbreak of hostilities on October 14.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The Security Council met this morning to hear accusations from both the Arab and Jewish sides of violating the truce. First, Egyptian Representative Kahchuba delivered a lengthy speech stating that the Jewish army took advantage of the truce to launch a large-scale military operation against Nikuf, claiming that its food convoy was attacked by the Egyptian army. He declared that the Jewish army's aggression was caused by the Security Council's inaction and the Jewish army's belief that a fait accompli could lead to recognition.</p>
<p>Lebanese Representative Amani also emphasized in similar remarks that the Jewish army's attack on Nikuf was aimed at occupying territory that should be assigned to the Arabs under the Bernadotte Plan. The Arab countries' representatives' accusations were refuted by Israeli Representative Eban, who stated that the Egyptian army's invasion of Palestine was a clear violation of the truce, but when the Egyptian army suffered a military defeat, it appealed to the Security Council. Eban then mentioned that the Security Council had suggested holding negotiations to discuss the Nikuf issue, stating that Nikuf resolutely refused to fall back into the chaos from which the city had just emerged. After the representatives from both sides debated, Chairman Austin, the US representative, issued a statement, saying that the council would not be influenced by the biases of either side, and that the debate on this issue would continue on the 28th, and then announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

This airport was built by 15,000 Berlin citizens under the supervision of US military engineers. Its area is similar to that of the currently used Tempelhof Airport, but its runways are better. The main difficulty is the aircraft, but the US government has authorized Clay to mobilize 66 C-54 transport aircraft, which has given Berlin and Paris the greatest possible psychological impact.</p>

<p>Jiang Jingguo, Economic Supervisor of the Shanghai District, believes that in the past month, many books and pictorials related to him have been published in Shanghai, and their content is mostly absurd and unfounded.

<h3 id="e87">Copper Coins in Short Supply; Snapped Up Upon Release; Long Lines in Front of the Issuing Bureau <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the release of one-cent copper coins a few days ago, citizens have been very interested in them and flocked to the issuing bureau of the Central Bank on the Bund to exchange them. It is said that at the beginning of the issuance a few days ago, each person could still exchange for ten yuan, but from yesterday onwards, there were so many people seeking to exchange that the Central Bank imposed restrictions, limiting each person to one yuan. According to a responsible person at the issuing bureau of the Central Bank, the production of these copper coins is currently limited. The Central Bank receives about ten boxes a day (each box contains 200 yuan of one-cent copper coins, totaling 20,000 coins). Yesterday, only 1.88 million coins arrived, which is far from meeting the demand. A long queue appeared in front of the issuing bureau yesterday, stretching all the way to Beijing Road. According to those who exchanged, the one-cent copper coins exchanged for ten yuan in Gold Yuan notes totaled 1,000 coins, weighing six catties. However, copper and iron shops in Hongkou are offering six and a half yuan per catty for the exchange of purple copper, so the value of ten yuan in copper coins has reached 39 yuan. Therefore, as soon as the copper coins are released, they may be collected and treasured. As for the fifty-cent silver coins, they will not be released until the beginning of next month. There is no definite date for when they will be available on the market.</p>

<p>The Propaganda Committee for Promoting the Diligence and Construction Movement in Shanghai held its first meeting at the Shanghai Club on Shaanxi South Road at 9 AM yesterday to strengthen the promotion of the Diligence and Construction Movement. Chairman Fang Zhi said in his speech: "At this time of tense military situation on the front lines, some people in society are pessimistic and fearful, and some selfish and self-interested profiteers are taking the opportunity to undermine economic management and hide goods, which has resulted in rampant black market rebellions. This phenomenon poses a great obstacle to the future of suppression and construction. The way to solve it is to vigorously practice diligence and thrift to overcome difficulties." Fang then emphasized the significance of diligence and thrift, that is, to persuade people to be diligent and thrifty for the country and the nation, not for their own selfish interests. He also encouraged the members to do their best to shoulder the task of propaganda to achieve complete success. Then, representatives Jin Longzhang, Zhou Feicheng, and Yu Wen expressed their opinions, all of which were sincere and concise. In the end, it was resolved to mobilize all cultural, journalistic, educational, entertainment, broadcasting, and other circles to continue to fully expand the propaganda of the Diligence and Thrift Movement.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Approximately 2,200 middle school students and primary and secondary school teachers and their families who evacuated from Yantai to Shanghai are temporarily residing in the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association on Ximen Road. Other refugees who came with them have sought refuge with relatives and friends in Shanghai. Yesterday, representatives of the refugee students and teachers went to the Supervisor's Office, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Education Bureau to request assistance in resolving issues related to their livelihood and schooling. Zhao Lantings, the principal of Zhongzheng Middle School and a member of the Yantai City Church Council, was sent to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education to arrange for their placement. Mayor Wu dispatched Municipal Government Counselor Li Jianhua to the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association yesterday afternoon to express his concern and conduct an investigation, promising to provide assistance and relief in all aspects. The Municipal Relief Committee has deployed mobile porridge carts since yesterday afternoon to provide hot porridge twice daily. Nearby residents have also generously donated food and cash. Regarding the schooling issue for the more than 2,000 students, it is reported that the Ministry of Education is preparing to establish ten joint middle schools along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line to accommodate refugee students from various regions. The group of students from Yantai who arrived in Shanghai will stay in Shanghai for about a week before being assigned to these schools. Registration will begin today.</p>
<p>Refugees Falling into the Water is a Common Sight</p>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter interviewed Zou Jian, the Speaker of the Yantai Municipal Assembly, who led the evacuation to Shanghai. He stated that those evacuated to Shanghai included 1,900 students from eight middle schools in Yantai: Guohua, Zhongzheng, Chongde, Chongzheng, Yiwen, Jianshi, Zhifu, and Zhenguang, as well as 300 primary and secondary school teachers and 200 family members of the teachers, including approximately 400 to 500 female students. They evacuated from Yantai on the 12th aboard the Anda Wheel steamer. Prior inquiries regarding the withdrawal to responsible authorities were unanswered. Later, it was learned that the families of soldiers stationed in Fushan, 30 miles outside Yantai, were evacuating, and 40,000 refugees from the area followed suit to Yantai. The students then packed their bags and negotiated for ships to evacuate. At that time, the coastal docks were crowded with approximately 15,000 refugees waiting for ships to escape, exposed to the elements. Every time a small sampan or similar vessel approached, they would rush to climb aboard, resulting in capsized boats and people falling into the water, with many forced to jump into the sea. The shore was filled with cries of despair, a shocking and unbearable sight. Many of those who ventured out to sea in small boats have not been heard from since, their whereabouts unknown. The population of Yantai is 140,000. Approximately 20,000 people evacuated to Qingdao. No fighting occurred in the city, and the large airport and factories, known as the second best in the country in terms of equipment, were not destroyed.</p>
<p>Nearby Residents Generously Donate</p>
<p>They traveled to Shanghai via Qingdao on the same ship. They had not eaten for several days en route, causing more than a hundred people to fall ill. The ship docked at the Qiujiang Wharf in this city on the afternoon of the 25th. The port command provided four vehicles to transport luggage. The students walked empty-handed and arrived at the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association on Ximen Road at 11 PM. Because it was late and no one was there to receive them, they spent the night in the courtyard in the rain. Because they had not eaten for many days on the ship and could not purchase food after arriving ashore, Zhu Liqing, the chief of the 41st Bao of Madang Road, near the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association, and Wu Rongfa, the chief of the 17th Jia, voluntarily mobilized residents in the area to cook and donate hot porridge. On the 26th, they cooked and delivered hot porridge and pickled vegetables for them to share. When they went to express their gratitude, they discovered that some of the donors were street vendors and rickshaw pullers. They were deeply moved by the precious enthusiasm of their compatriots and were moved to tears. They now hope that the authorities can resolve the schooling issue for the students as soon as possible to prevent them from wasting their youth and studies.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was active due to firm and rising prices of goods from other areas. Furthermore, with the price controls being relaxed, although still under discussion, public sentiment has been stimulated. With the upcoming identity card exchange, citizens are still flocking to buy cotton cloth. The daily sales of the three major and well-known cloth stores in the city each reach approximately 1,000 bolts. With solid inventories from the past, they are still able to maintain their business. However, ordinary small and medium-sized cloth stores are selling more than they are receiving, and their inventories are dwindling. Fortunately, the Textile Construction Company distributes goods, currently only to retail cloth stores, which is a major source of supply. In addition, the dyeing and weaving industries continue to distribute cloth, so they are barely able to maintain their business. However, they still feel that the amount of distributed goods is not enough, and the patterns of the high-end colored cloth, indanthrene drill cloth, and ordinary cotton cloth sold daily in limited quantities to identity card holders are all old.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company distributed the usual bolts of cloth, including 29.5-yard semi-finished vice brand serge at 23.5 yuan per bolt, limited to (dyeing factories) for purchase. Also, 12-pound large trumpet, Yanghe, and Wufu brand fine cloth were all sold at 23.3 yuan per bolt, limited to (retail stores) for purchase. In addition, large size 6000 number gray cloth was 25 yuan, and Jumping Carp Jingyuan straight tribute gabardine was 29.6 yuan, both limited to (retail stores) for purchase. There were also American cloth 014-3 and 5 printed stripe cloth at 1 yuan per meter, and 015-73 color cloth at 1 yuan per foot, both limited to (retail stores) for purchase. In addition, there were many applicants for cotton毛衫 and trousers, Textile Construction gabardine, etc.</p>
<p>The fourth batch of goods allocated by the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Commissioned Association amounted to approximately 9,000 bolts. Purchase procedures began yesterday afternoon, but the amount that could be purchased was still limited to 10 bolts per household. If a household received 20 bolts in the previous allocation, the allocation for this period would be temporarily suspended, but they could still purchase as usual in the next period.</p>

Before issuing certificates, the actual situation in various regions and the supply and demand situation in this city should be determined to set limits.

<p>Further Information: Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to be suspended. The cotton market situation was very firm. Transaction prices exceeded the controlled price by more than double. In particular, Zhoupu seed cotton was more popular. Cotton merchants and factories in Shanghai sent personnel to the producing areas to rush purchases in the past two days, causing the black market to rise to an unprecedented level, and holders were unwilling to sell.</p>

<p>The National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office is still finding it difficult to start its cotton purchasing business in various regions. It is reported that the purchasing offices established by the office in various regions have not received any cotton deliveries in the days since they opened. In order to solve the above difficulties, the office has decided to consult with the Central Bank to borrow 12,000 bales of cotton yarn to be transported to the producing areas for exchange.</p>
<p>It is reported that after the cotton yarn arrives in the cotton producing areas, the office will still handle the exchange procedures with local merchants. After the cotton obtained from the first batch of exchanges is collected, it will be distributed to the yarn factories according to the original proportion of capital contribution for the exchange of cotton cloth. The cloth obtained from the exchange will be transported to various regions according to the estimated results of the first phase of cotton collection in various regions for the second batch of exchanges. On the other hand, it will consult with the Cotton Production Improvement Office and the Farmers Bank to proceed.</p>

In his opening address, Mao pointed out that the Taiwanese people have shed 50 years of blood and sweat, devoting themselves to construction, but have not enjoyed true prosperity. He stated that future construction in Taiwan should have four major premises: (1) Engage in people's livelihood construction in coordination with the whole country. (2) Make construction achieve true prosperity and universally improve the lives of the Taiwanese people. (3) Construction in Taiwan should be driven by Taiwanese personnel. (4) Make Taiwan become a national industrial focus. Wei Daoming then gave a speech, saying that construction in Taiwan is mainly driven by manpower, and he hoped that experts would conduct research and provide guidance. He Yingqin encouraged Taiwan to become a major national defense industry base and hoped that experts would pay special attention to this. Chen Qida stated that whether in terms of politics, national defense, people's livelihood, or morality, China must first be industrialized before it can be improved. This is also the key to China turning from weak to strong, and the responsibility lies with the engineers. After speeches by Huang Chaoqin and You Mijian, the ceremony concluded.

<p>— A Whim</p>
<p>"Hey, want '200,000-head units'?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Paired with penicillin, the real deal."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but pay attention. I saw a man, about thirty years old, wearing an old Western suit, holding a worn canvas briefcase in one hand, a half-smoked cigarette dangling from his mouth, hawking his so-called "200,000-head units" at the counters. The people behind the counters seemed uninterested, saying lazily, "Don't want it!"</p>
<p>I lowered my head and carefully examined various watches in the glass cabinet of a watch seller across from him. However, from the corner of my eye, I seemed to see someone slowly approaching the man selling "200,000-head units." They seemed like strangers, brushing past each other, but a low voice clearly drifted into my ears:</p>
<p>"What's the price?"</p>
<p>I raised my head and looked at the Western medicine on the neighboring counter again. Glancing back occasionally, the man selling "200,000-head units" had disappeared.</p>
<p>I was about to ask the person behind the counter if they had the Listerine toothpaste I was so eager to buy, when another person came along. It was a young man of about twenty-two or twenty-three, dressed entirely in surplus U.S. military gear—a dark green jacket, khaki pants, and mid-calf leather boots. He came up and immediately asked:</p>
<p>"Want '200,000-head units'? Fresh goods."</p>
<p>I glanced at him and saw a gold tooth shining brightly in his mouth. In my mind, I was revising an ancient poem: "In the morning, capture yellow cattle, in the evening, capture yellow cattle. Morning capture, evening capture, the yellow cattle remain the same!"</p>
<p>My poetic inspiration faded, and I walked forward again, suddenly seeing a large pile of glass (P.astic) dishes of all sizes, pink, light green, and milky white, which were quite lovely. I picked out a size that was a little larger, suitable for serving dishes, and asked the stall owner how much it cost.</p>
<p>"Forty-eight dollars!"</p>
<p>He probably saw that I was startled, so he explained with a smile, "Forty-eight dollars a dozen, not expensive at all!"</p>
<p>I said, "Isn't four dollars apiece still expensive? So, can I buy a few individually?"</p>
<p>"No, I only sell wholesale here. If you don't buy a dozen, then at least half a dozen."</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need to buy new dishes at my house. Since he said so, then let him find a buyer who knows the value of the goods. Suddenly, it occurred to me that yellow cattle and solo traders are "two sides of the same coin."</p>
<p>Feeling quite stuffy, I took out a cigarette, lit it, and took a puff. Looking ahead—that's right, there were indeed people wholesaling goods here. Two plainly dressed middle-aged men were opening their travel bags and stuffing bundles of glass combs into them.</p>
<p>Walking two more steps, great, wasn't I looking to buy Listerine toothpaste? Here at this counter, there were all kinds of excellent toothpaste—not just Listerine, but also Gu Ling Yu, and Colgate, all sizes available, many varieties. I went up to the counter and asked the owner to get me a large tube of Listerine toothpaste.</p>
<p>However, his reply was to turn up his nose. His head suddenly tilted upward, and his gaze seemed to focus on a cobweb on the ceiling. Then, in the coldest, most chilling tone, he said:</p>
<p>"We only do wholesale here!"</p>
<p>This left me speechless, and I turned around and left. Thinking about it, it's really strange: If I found what I wanted to buy in a department store on Nanjing Road or Avenue Joffre, they would definitely only let me buy one item, and they would even stamp my ID card, lest I buy too much. Here, they won't even let me buy too little!</p>
<p>There are indeed many differences between this place and places like Nanjing Road: For example, Miss Fodor brand high-end cosmetics, which have become a rare commodity in Nanjing Road stores, are abundant here. Sanli Pain tablets, which are difficult to buy in the market, are also readily available here. Moreover, there are no transaction restrictions here, citizen IDs are not needed at all, and—the "8/19" price controls seem to not exist.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what this place is? This is the largest "market" in Nanshi, conveniently located near old shops selling fermented rice wine balls and steamed buns, a long-established bookstore and teahouse, and even the famous fortune teller said to be effective for everything. If you believe in burning incense and making vows, then there are plenty of grand and small temples here, with incense smoke lingering all year round, and there are indeed many pious men and women.

<h3 id="e124">On Stamping <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Old Dan</p>
<p>Not long ago, I talked about how "signing and stamping" is like building a house on top of a bed, which is inappropriate. Now I am reminded of stamping letters. Originally, the signature on a letter, the ordinary name and respectful greeting (or respectful address, or respectful bow, or respectful salutation, etc.), should be in the format of "Zhang San, respectful salutation" continuously. If a personal seal is added, the seal is stamped on the ink between the character "San" and the character "respectful," or at the bottom of the character "salutation." This indicates that the seal was added after the letter was written. However, in recent years, some people, especially those in government agencies and organizations, have a different approach. They mostly leave a space between the name and the greeting to stamp the seal. Some social titles also leave a space between the name and the respectful title to stamp the seal. I don't know who started this, creating such a nonsensical way of stamping letters. Now it is popular in agencies and in society, with misinformation leading to the acceptance of incorrect practices. It's truly absurd. Perhaps they think the seal should be given a position to express itself, so they came up with this method of leaving a space to stamp the seal. These words are naturally not a valid reason. We see that the official seals on all documents are always stamped below the "Republic of China's" "China" character, that is, on the ink of the characters such as "October 24, 37th year" (assumed date). They never leave a space of the length of a seal between "Republic of China" and "October 24, 37th year" to stamp the seal. Because the personal seal or official seal, read below the name or above the year, belongs to a kind of "official seal" meaning. Otherwise, they can simply pre-stamp the seal on the letterhead or official paper, which has too many drawbacks. The general inspection of the authenticity of documents, checking whether the seal or official seal is stamped on the handwriting, or whether the writing is on the ink, one before the other, is very important.</p>
<p>Speaking of stamping, I am reminded of a story: During the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, Jian Youwen took over as the Shandong Salt Transport Commissioner. He didn't have his own team, and most of the staff in the office were old hands. When the first proclamation was about to be posted, the head of the document group brought the proclamation to ask what seal should be stamped. To put it bluntly, this was testing whether the new official understood official business. At that time, Jian listened and really couldn't tell him what seal should be stamped. But Jian's quick wit was born, and he immediately put on a stern face and said, "What exactly do you do? Do you have to ask me about everything!" The head of the document group was rebuffed and knew that Jian was not easy to deal with. Because Jian's answer left him with nothing else to ask, he could only say "Yes! Yes!" and leave.</p>
<p>Once, at a calligraphy and painting exhibition, I saw a painting by someone named Chen, with a seal in the corner that said "Longmian Family Law." If the painter hadn't specified that he was named Chen, anyone with a little common sense would have said that the painter was named Li, because Longmian is named Li. This is what people who don't seek thorough understanding do, like leaving a space to stamp the seal under the name, which is a joke.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Happiness <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— As You Wish</p>
<p>The American "Reader's Digest" published this month has the following passage:</p>
<p>"Chinese people have this proverb: If you want an hour of happiness, you can drink alcohol; if you want three days of happiness, you can get married; if you want eight days of happiness, you can slaughter the pig you raised and eat a big meal. If you want a lifetime of happiness, then you should cultivate a garden and be your own gardener."</p>
<h3 id="e126">"Money Makes the Devil Grind the Mill" <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Shuo Fu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Money makes the devil grind the mill." These days, it seems necessary to interpret it differently. Even if someone has enough money with them, if you can't get through other relationships besides money, especially personal relationships, you can't buy a piece of flannel, a white shirt, silk stockings, unopened canned food, more than one bar of soap, and even according to the housewives returning from the vegetable market, you can't buy pork, beef, or even a duck egg. Our country is known as an agricultural country, but the food panic and shortage problem doesn't seem to be as serious as in England, where potatoes are the main side dish.</p>
<p>The streets are also especially crowded. People who usually stay at home during the day seem to have all come to the streets. It seems that a Shanghai that is twice as big as before is needed to accommodate them. All kinds of shops are filled with people. Everything is a rush, everyone is rushing to buy shirts, soap, toothpaste, biscuits, candy... everyone is rushing to take streetcars, so they can get to their shopping destination early.</p>
<p>The leisurely life has at least temporarily passed, although I love some leisure. The more tragic phenomenon is that everyone doesn't seem enthusiastic about pursuing knowledge. I hear many people say that they don't have time to make a living these days, so where do they have free time to read! In fact, these complainers are not busy running around for food and clothing all day, but spend a lot of their free time playing cards at friends' homes, eating in restaurants, or killing time in dance halls. What is gratifying is that the books in the city's bookstores and street stalls are still very abundant, and the prices have not reached a crazy level, allowing us to browse at will and choose the best to buy.</p>
<p>If we dare to face reality, we have to admit that the general public's view of money has not only lost its value storage function, but also lost its meaning as a medium of exchange. The analysis of this problem may be very complicated. All the measures and methods are thinking for the good, and in the meantime, there is a dispute between selfish interests and national concepts, and the basic hopes of individuals to survive and preserve property are included.</p>
<p>I often think that if the monetary system planning can be changed, such as the United States during the War of Independence, Germany after the First World War, etc., they have all had malignant inflation, and they were able to survive it safely. Under strict management, using physical objects that can gain people's faith as the currency's reserve, and maintaining the currency's credit by exchanging physical objects, should alleviate the rush to buy things. Economists have created the comprehensive commodity standard theory, although it is more difficult to implement, but it can be used as a reference.</p>
<p>When money can fully exert its functions, I think "Money makes the devil grind the mill" will still be regarded as the truth by most people, because the traditional view of the omnipotence of money is too deeply rooted.</p>

<p>— Lin</p>
<p>On December 9, 1943, a body divided into several sections was suddenly discovered on the railway tracks near Fort Valley, Georgia, USA. Later, it was found that the deceased's name was John. Kemp. At the time, many people thought that Kemp had probably fallen asleep drunk and been crushed into pieces by the train.</p>
<p>However, the railway police quickly determined that it was murder. Soon, they caught the murderer—the deceased's wife.</p>
<p>It turned out that before murdering her husband, the woman had indeed spent a lot of effort. She had carefully studied how many sections a body would be divided into when hit by a train, and how these sections would fly away and scatter on both sides of the track. Then, she followed suit, killed her husband, and dismembered the body into sections, placing them near the track—perfectly. However, the net of heaven is vast, and the track she chose happened to be one that no train had passed on since August! Because she made this biggest mistake, the detectives quickly solved the case.</p>

<p>Suddenly aware of the dust of the world for fifty years, dream traces and poetic traces have long been like smoke; returning, I only remember the words of the past, and the pines and chrysanthemums are also virtuous in my eyes. (When I was eighteen or nineteen, I often visited Ganjiuyuan, and now it has been fifty years.)</p>
<p>Who knows the joy of fish swimming in the Hao River! The efforts of the gentlemen are still worthy of poetry; competing for sentences, playing checkers, money following the old generation, I remember all the flavors of my childhood. (My ancestral home was in Qingshui Hao, and later my uncle and grandfather Tianchuan, and my biological father and uncle Shuda also lived here. When I was young, I was not abandoned by the elders, so many gentlemen in the album were favored by my hands. Master Jie An invited me to teach in Wuchang, and I specialized in the topic door saying: "Yongjia School, Jingchu Years." The master greatly appreciated it and revealed it to the public, and thus gained a thin reputation at the time. When I was in my twenties, Master Xinbo liked to visit me and my brothers often, and we often played checkers in the house until dawn. The wins and losses were only one or two yuan, which was very ridiculous. However, he often taught me the way of learning in the meantime, and encouraged me a lot. When I was eighteen, I asked Master Yishifu to correct my jade moss poem. The master always posted it to the poets, saying that it was like Bishan. I began to deliberately write poetry from then on, and other things are not worth mentioning. Now that I am old and have not accomplished anything, I have failed the expectations of the elders.)</p>
<p>The road in front of Doumu Palace is already deep, and the past events of the chrysanthemum field are unbearable to mention; sadly, only Wei Lang is left, and the Illusion Dwelling Garden is gradually setting in the west. (The Illusion Dwelling Garden is my cemetery in the Cuiwei Mountains of Beiping, where my second wife Jingchi is buried.)</p>
