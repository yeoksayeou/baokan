<h3>司徒立門離美返華　說明工業配件計劃下各公司之責任　須用最低費用及最短時間完成工作</h3>
<p>〔本市經合分署訊〕經合署三千五百萬美元援華工業配件計劃下各計劃工程公司之責任，經於廿九日由華盛頓方面加以鄭重表明。</p>
<p>經合署技術調查團團長司徒立門布記者招待會上宣稱：「本計劃受惠者所聘請之工程公司，須以最低之費用及可能最短之時間，執行各項計劃」。會後，司徒氏卽離華盛頓遄赴上海，將於下星期初抵此。</p>
<p>截至今日止，在配件方案下已有十四項工程計劃共計二千二百五十萬美元經暫行核准。上述方案係賴樸翰氏所執行二億七千五百萬全部美援之一部。</p>
<p>全部工程計劃之選擇，旨在予中國工業經濟最大利益，迨其進行順利將使中國之紡織，糖，電力與鐵路各主要企業及有關各業大量增加工作之需要。</p>
<p>司徒氏對於本計劃祗任用有經驗之工程公司一節，力言其可以使計劃進行迅速，並獲得高度效率之成就。</p>
<p>目今接受援助之企業中，冀北電力公司，揚十電力公司，開灤煤礦及台灣精業四者，已經選定渠等之工程師，其他十種企業，據司徒氏稱：已經促其儘速從事選聘。司徒氏並謂：「在接洽担任各企業之工程師業務上，各工程公司得享受均等之機會，例如合灣鐵道公司」。</p>
<p>各工程公司在服務時，應有合理之報酬，但其計算方式並不依一定成數，因各種工作之性質與數量在幣値之關係上，並不相同也。</p>
<p>司徒氏又稱：「在經合署之程序下，各工程公司與企業之關係，係屬職業性質，工程公司須代表各該企業在全世界各地採辦價格與交貨條件最優越之配件，並將盡力獲取競爭之價格」。</p>
<p>爲節省時間，金錢，並爲協助其他從事復興計劃之國家起見，所有本計劃應用之材料除在美國訂購外，並在其他禹歇爾計劃下之國家及日本採辦。此外，善後事業保管委員會，物資供應局及其他機構所存之剩餘材料，亦將加以利用。此項辦法可以節省美金部份之開支，而使計劃之執行時間延長。</p>
<p>此項計劃，華盛頓之觀察家稱爲「新的方式」。茲爲使其在執行上發生最大效率起見，每一計劃工程師須簽訂服務誓約書，並經計劃之執行者副署，證明下列各點：（一）根據適當之技術性調查，本計劃應產生預定之效果。（二）在採購上業已多方調查，以保價格與交貨之條件最爲優越。（三）工程公司須開列說明書，保證以最速及最經濟之方式採辦材料，並裝置設備。（四）隨時須應需要提出進度報告書。</p>
<p>司徒氏又稱：「在計劃工程師遞送上項誓約書之草約時，渠等須與技術團討論有關酬報，採辦材料之方式，及競爭報價等事項，如屬需要，材料之報吿，將以密封報價之方式舉行之」。</p>
<p>上述之技術國，將由中國政府雇用一特殊之工程公司代表之。該公司之任務，將爲美援下中美工業建設與配件計劃聯合委員會之顧問及監督工程師。</p>

<h3>社論　評張羣的「日本觀感」</h3>
<p>前行政院長張羣氏，赴日視察歸國後，整理他所得的材料，於本月廿八日晚向國人廣播，全文業經披露日昨本報。這一篇講演，比在日發表的「吿日本國民書」重要，它瀝陳在日三週的觀察所得，而表示相當的滿意：最後發出亞洲世紀的號角，有所呼喚，有所企求。正當聯合國大會在巴黎舉行，區域安全制高唱入雲之際，毫無疑義的，張羣氏「日本觀戚」的發表，不僅有深長的意味，並且對於亞洲具有遠大的影響。</p>
<p>這篇講演的內容，包括有多方面的觀察。關於對日觀威，他對麥帥管制下的日本，相當表示滿意，他解答管制下的日本，軍備已經解除，警察力量也很薄弱，海上保安廳僅有防止走私的船艘，沒有任何的武裝，因此他確定日本不可能重建一套足以應付下次大戰的國防力量。在政治上，日本新憲限制了天皇的權力，象徵的天皇不可能成爲神，盟總已經把政治與宗敎完全分離。尤其麥帥對「中道政治」的扶植，軍國主義殘餘人物的整肅，因此他確信「日本式的神權法西斯的政治，是不容易再抬頭的了」。不過。張氏說：「建立民主的制度比較容易，而養成民主心理與民主生活，還是困難」。在經濟上，他認爲日本的經濟現狀，離開自給自足，還是很遠，更說不上經濟復興。他列舉解散財閥和農地改革的進行，五年計劃所輸入的物質，百分之四十來自亞洲，百分之五十來自美元區域，因此斷定說：「日本在經濟條件上不能重行建立一個足以威脅和平的軍國，而關鍵正是操在我們中國手裏」。最後，他指出今後世界的建設，將以亞洲爲中心，亞洲世紀已經開始了，我們對於日本問題的處理，不僅是消極的不予報復，幷要積極的有所作爲。如何作爲呢？歸納張氏的見解，有下列各點（一）對日本拋棄消極的無益的猜疑，我國應建立積極的對日政策；（二）從亞洲各國家民族全盤利益與中日永久的關係上，採取遠大的措施，促成對日和會的召開；（三）確實獲得亞洲民族共同不虞匱乏的自由，然後纔能確實獲得亞洲民族共同免於恐懼的自由。日本問題是一個亞洲問題，在整個亞洲問題中來考慮處理日本問題，一切歷史的恩怨和戰後的疑慮，便自然得到正確的解答。</p>
<p>張氏這篇講演，對日本現狀的觀察，遽下過早的結論，我們未敢完全贊同，但對亞洲遠景的瞭望，其深思熟慮，具有遠見，値得欽佩。愛抒所見，與張氏曁國人商榷之：</p>
<p>第一，張羣此次訪日，經三週時間，搜集資料必多。張氏列舉麥帥管制下的日本，在軍備上，政治上及經濟上，幾可無令人猜忌與恐個之處，未免太樂觀了。首先，日本經濟走向復興的道路，是一種事實，此項復興如不經由盟國共同監督管制執行，便可能成爲軍國主義復活之前奏，此乃盟國政治家一般的看法。日本經濟計劃的輸入原料，百分之四十以上在亞洲，其大部原料供應，冀求於中國，而其工業製成品的推廣市塲，大部在中國，這仍是「工業日本農業中國」的舊路。尤其是現階段的日本政治，尙未澈底做到「思想革命」與「心理建設」，換言之，政治的民主化和經濟民主化，並未從泥土要生根起、來，因此我們是不能遽信日本經濟復興不會威脅中國的。爲要澈底澄淸日本問題，我們同意早日召開對日和會，依照波茨坦宣言和遠東委員會決議，締結日本和約，眞正在　國監督下，促成日本經濟的民主化，以達到政治的民主化。現階段的日本政洽，實與眞正民主化的途徑尙有距離。</p>
<p>第二、張氏指出世界中心在亞洲，是最正確的看法。尼赫魯於印度建國週年，曾發出同樣的呼喚　深爲亞洲人民所重視。亞洲佔地球陸面三分之一，擁有全世界人口二分之一，面　千八百萬方哩，人口千兆三億·歐洲人和美洲人都說，人類的時代從巴比倫埃及到默美，今復轉到亞洲了。當前的世界，處於兩極夾攻中，而人類眞正的思想和出路，則不在兩極中，古人有云：「眞理不在此極端或彼極端，而是在兩極之中的」。亞洲世紀是兩極之中的世紀，它從千年的思想和歷史經騐昇華而成，有極高明而道中庸的哲學基礎。我們同情張氏具有遠見的呼喚，並希望以我國爲中心，進行與亞洲各國，尤其是新生的國家，爲建立泛亞洲的和平及經濟繁榮，能舉行亞洲國際會議。尼赫魯曾說：亞洲不能摒棄日本，完全壓制日本民族是不智的：我們以爲日本如經澈底的思想革命以後，應該導致她走上眞正和平光明的道路，</p>
<p>總之，從亞洲全盤利益上解決日本問題，理路是正確的，惟對日本現狀不能存有過多的奢望，因爲和會未開，和約未訂，盟國共同理想的新日本尙未出現，我們對於日本問題是不能太樂觀的。</p>

<h3>配售日賠償機　暫照對折計繳　以半月為繳款限期</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕配售民營事業之日本賠償機器盟總核定價格甚高，政務會議頃已決定，暫照百分之五十計算，先行計繳，俠和會確定價格後，再行依照增减。查民營事業價購日本賠償物資，應依法定匯率美金一元折合金圓券四元繳納，其繳款期限亦經商定爲本年九月十五日截止。惟近據新民機器廠等呈請重定價格，卽由工商，財政，外交各部會商，決定兩項辦法：一爲配合改革幣制，以八月十九日物價爲準，其賠償工具機暫照盟總核定價百分之六十五計算，先行計繳，俟和會確定價後再行依照增减。二卽今日通過之辦法，依照百分之五十計算。按前者乃適用於國內者，後者則爲適用於國際間。同時爲將來在和會上提議减價有所依據起見，以後者之標準爲宜。其繳款期限則俟本辦法頒布之日起，以半個月爲繳款限期，邊遠地方及特殊情形之廠礦，則得酌予延　，但亦不得超過一個月。</p>

<h3>根據聯合國憲章規定　三強對蘇提起控訴　指封鎖柏林威脅世界和平</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿九日廣播：美·英·法三國廿九日正式向聯合國控訴其戰時盟國蘇聯因其封鎖柏林之行爲而威脅世界和平。此項正式控訴牒文由美國務卿馬歇爾·英外相貝文·法外畏許曼分別以文字相同之函件，派遺專使遞交聯合國秘書長賴依。控訴文件稱：「本人代表本國向閣下陳訴，請閣下注意蘇聯政府限制德境西方佔區與柏林間運輸及交通之嚴重事態，此舉與本國政府有關佔領及管制柏林之　利相抵觸。蘇聯此舉實違反聯合國憲章第二條所規定之義務，並威脅憲章第七章所揭示之和平，觀於三國政府興蘇聯一再交換文件及舉行談判，三國政府深知在憲章規定下彼等有以和平手段解決爭端之義務，已竭盡努力與蘇聯直接談判，以消釋三國與蘇聯間之　隙。蘇聯政府與西方列强間之爭端，旣非交通上之按衛的困難，亦非對管理柏林通貨條件之獲取協議，其爭端乃在蘇聯政府已以其行動明白表示該國不　其應負之義務，企　以非法及成　手段取得其不應有且不能以和平方法獲致之政治目標。該國已使用封鎖方法，以饑餓及經濟崩潰威脅柏林居民，坐視騷亂行爲之發生，並企圖推翻合法產生之柏林市政府。蘇聯政府之態度及行爲，極端顯示其有繼續施行非法及威壓的封鎖之意，並有意以其非法之行爲，使美法英三國自柏林佔領國之地位，降至完全屈服於蘇聯勢力下之境地，由是獲得絕對權力以控制柏林居民之經濟政治及社會生活，並將柏林市併入蘇聯佔區以內。蘇聯政府已因此而造成一種局面，在現存情勢下已無再行覓求聯合國憲章第卅三條所規定解決方法之可能，且已構成對世界和平及安全之威脅，此點應由蘇聯政府單獨負責。美英法三國政府爲防止世界和平及安全之再度遭受危害，除保留爲維持其柏林地位而採取必要措置之完全權利外，爰不得不將蘇聯政府之行爲，提交聯合國安理會，俾安理會得及早考慮此一問題。</p>
<h3>處理柏林問題爭案　我態度舉足重輕　王外長正慎重加以檢討</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿八日電〕記者今日自接近中國代表團人士處獲悉，中國對柏林問題，正予以愼電考慮中國之立塲，俟此問題提交安理會時，卽將有所表明。因中國現爲安理會五常任理事國之一，中國之立塲關係重大，因根據柏林問題所將引用之聯合國燾章第六章規定，中國爲五强中唯一非爭端當事國，有權使用否決權，而英美法蘇則不能參與表決。</p>
<p>中國代表團團長王世杰今晨曾召集各代表及顧問舉行會議，會中對於有關柏林情勢之政治及程序問題，曾作澈底之討論。中國對此問題之立塲亦重加檢討，然中國代表團認爲對柏林問題提交安理會，將牽涉甚多技術上之困難。</p>

<h3>安理會各代表　力為海邦辯護</h3>
<p>對藩王撤回控訴表示懷疑</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎廿八日電〕安理會今日處理海德拉巴德爭端未獲成就，蓋若干代表對於海邦藩王通知撤回案件一　是否有效，表示懷疑。我國代表將廷　曾作選輯之申辯稱：吾人均同意海德拉巴德藩王之通知，係經渠親自簽警，故應無懷疑。而其他代表則稱：該藩王之撤回案件，可能出於印度壓力所迫。阿根廷代表安爾詩稱：所有通知，均係經印度轉來，此爲「狼代羊言」。（在聆聽印度代表公　陳述之後。）前任安理會之「海總拉巴德代表」今日並未採取具體行動。此次會震計有提案兩件，一爲叙利亞提議安理會直接調查海德拉巴德之局勢；二爲阿根廷提議續請所有印軍完全退出海德拉巴德。</p>

<h3>南代表抨擊美國　與蘇聯臭味相投</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿九日電〕南斯拉夫副總理卡台奇繼起發言，竭力支持蘇聯，而指斥西方企圖破壞聯合國。按卡氏爲南國獨裁者狄托之左右手，前時與狄托固被共產情報局開除，然此次恪守蘇聯攻擊西方之路綫，並籲請聯大通過蘇聯裁軍建議。卡氏言詞中，絕無史達林狄托兩人已失和之暗示可尋，渠頌揚蘇聯及其共產制度爲世界第一及最大之希望，然此善致頌詞者實久已失歡於蘇　矣。其論調並不　動西方外交家，蓋南國一方面在　慕背後與蘇聯內　不已，然表面仍與蘇聯臭味相投。卡氏提出下冽數點指斥美國，（一）（二）產生及發展西德，作爲美國在西歐軍事輕濟據點；（二）在盟國及其他國家境內屯駐軍隊，（三）在近東「煽動混亂」；（四）「重建日本爲反蘇基地」；（五）不實踐和平搽約；（六）組織廣泛軍事基地系統；（七）拒絕確軍並取締原子彈。</p>
<h3>曼紐斯基指貝文　對蘇揮動原子彈</h3>
<p>最後發言者為烏克蘭外長曼紐斯基，渠指斥英國分裂德國及歐洲，以便奴役歐人。曼氏並控指英外相貝文「在此講壇上面對蘇聯揮動原子彈」，渠指斥美國擁有軍事據點四八九處，以統治全球。然其言詞主要在反駁具文及比代表史巴克，而稱兩人「企圖驚攝其本國人民。西方國家在此搖旗吶喊，高呼恐懽，俾其眞正計劃能　於此烟幕之後，是卽策動反蘇東方民主國家之戰爭」。曼紐斯基演說畢，今日上午大會中之辯論，在十一時四十五分卽吿結束，而大會亦暫行休會，等待通告再行復會，</p>
<h3>柏林問題發展　杜威極為注意</h3>

<p>主席王雲五告四十七國之代表謂，世界經濟復興，已獲有「値得注意之進展」。惟渠復謂，此項進展尙屬過緩而有限，不足以補償戰時之損失與滿足現行緊急情形之需要。王氏繼稱，許多國家之預算仍極難以應付國際支付之支絀，使許多國家對於原已縮减甚烈之美元資金，不得不繼續大量支取。王氏謂，茍無美國之對外援助，出席現行會議之許多代表勢將為各處國家之經濟生存而展開激烈之鬥爭，而不能若目前之集合一起，爲更繁榮與穩定之世界經濟設法合作矣。渠稱。「歐洲復興計劃之存在，使吾人對於將來發生信心。美國最近之行動，保證西歡之建設工作將向前邁進，而復興之將獲得成功，刻巳接近成爲定論矣。」王氏力言外界之援助，對於遠東曾遭戰爭各區之復與以及工業落後地區之更進一步工業化，實屬需要。渠謂，在實行此等計劃時，必須以全世界之經濟福利爲前題。</p>

<h3>紡建第一門市部　受委託零售呢絨　總數三百萬碼　供應不虞匱乏</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕行政院善後事業委員會保管委員會某發言人，昨對該會委託中國紡建公司第一門市部供售呢絨一事，對本報記者作如下之說明：該批呢絨，總數約有三百餘萬碼，大部係來自澳洲，係由聯總行總結束後，移交該會保管者。聯總行總時代，以該批呢絨，不適於救濟之用，惟又未便在市塲大量拋售，蓋恐影響國產呢絨市價，故遲遲未予處理。迨移交善後保管會後，最近爲奉行政府配售物資吸收游資之功令起見，決定委託紡建第一門市部零售，惟該會仍保留隨時停售之權。該批呢絨，共有二十餘種，各種顏色俱備，惟以女色呢所佔較多，男式大衣呢亦不少</p>
<p>六碼剪成一段</p>
<p>現先供售女色呢，價每碼自二元二角起至二元八角止，每六碼剪成一段，每人限購一段。男式大衣呢，雖已開包，惟尙未估價，故暫未供售。該會估價係分請本市呢絨業，紡建公司等代表會同商定，估價以較低於市價百分之十爲原則。出售之價款，由中國銀行代收，作爲善後保管會財源收入之一。渠表示；在紡建門市部每日營菜時間以內（每日自上午十時至下午六時），該批呢絨均屬無限制供售，且總數多至三百萬碼，供應毌　匱之，市民似無擠　之必要。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕蔣經國於昨晚六時，召集本市米業代表萬墨林·徐頌仁·印福祥·胡文安·舉行談話會，討論疏導本市米源。出席代表力陳米業之困難，謂上海食米限價低於外埠故來貨不暢。譬如在限價以前，周浦每日有米五六百擔運滬，目前則禁運出口。其他各產米地區亦有同樣情形。萬墨林當時並就本市存米及其他有關情形，提供書面報吿。蔣督導員於聽聽取米業之困難後，卽指示各代表勸導米商勉力從事採購，如有困難，由渠負責解決。開會時程義寬亦在座，談話會至七時一刻始結束。蔣督導員隨卽召集麵粉業代表席德柄王禹卿會商，交換麵粉增產意見。</p>

<h3>購儲會積極準備　今後數個月糧源</h3>
<p>日來謠傳十月份配米暫停供應，影響人心至鉅，經記者向有關當局多方探詢，證明絕無其事。並獲悉政府非惟決心盡最大努力，克服困難，繼續供應十月份配米，且有加强配政，期使配售長期進行之準備。同時又獲悉緊急糧食購儲會對今後數個月之配糧來源，亦已開始積極準備。美援肥料五萬噸，政府已決定撥交該會交換台糧，估計易取台糧數量，可達五萬二千至六萬噸之鉅，該會主任楊綽庵，糧食部美籍顧問赫德，暨美援會，經合分署代表一行，日內卽將飛台，洽商交換事宜。</p>

<h3>服佩蠟像展覽　國內尙屬創舉　明起在山東會館舉行</h3>
<p>歷代人物塑造像栩栩如生</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕以研究　　及中國歷代服佩制度著譽國內之程枕霞，近應太市美術館籌備處之邀，由平携來其近計年創作計廿二件，自下月一日起，在自忠路（西門路）山東會館陳列展覽。服佩蠟像展覽在我國尙屬創舉，在近代文物藝術研究上允具價値。該項服佩蠟像係由漢代以迄民國，包括漢魏仕女裝，唐帔子，唐胡服，宋常禮女服，元罟罟，明末女常服，明士大夫服，明童子服，明老嫗服，明婢女服，費宮人刺虎，淸文官，淸武將，慈禧太后萬壽仙衣，淸宮人，皇子吉服，皇貴妃，蒙古小羣主，民國祭服，武訓，民國女禮服等廿二件，均分別隔室陳列。所有蠟像及服佩，俱經作者稽考史籍，詳加據證，每歷時年餘，始完成一完美之模型。蠟像面部神采奕奕，悉如眞人，如陳列費宮人刺虎一室，更配置皇宮內室大婚幕景，更使人宛如身臨史劇舞台·其中慈禧服飾及皇子吉服，且係向故宮搜購而得，故尤爲名貴。按蠟像製作源自英法兩國，程氏早年留英，卽隨名家研習製作技術，當時我國藝術界對蠟像尙缺乏具體認識，渠返國後在平任敎燕大，對我國歷代服佩制度更苦心研層，造詣頗深。此次展出作品，卽係渠十數年來綜合研究之精心傑作。</p>

<h3>限價政策堅持到底　蔣經國誓與奸商進行長期消耗戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣經國昨晚非正式邀宴本市外籍記者，由漁管處處畏趙君邁出面邀請，出席駐滬外報記者及通訊社代表十餘人，蔣督導員因有要公待理，由高秘書代表招待。高氏於答覆各項問題時，强調蔣經國有決心貫澈限價政策，謂根據戰時重慶限價之經驗，囤貨者常以隱匿物資之方式，迫使政府提高其限價，致限價政策最後終吿失敗。今日蔣氏具有決心，卽使商人不以貨物應市，亦將堅持其限價，相信經過兩三個月之相持，限價政策終將獲得勝利。例如上海如因限價之故，而無猪肉供應，市民依然可生活，但如堅持三個月，肉商未必能受得了。蔣氏具此信念，決對此種有組織之破壞勢力，進行長期之消耗戰。經濟管制實施一個月來，上海物價尙稱平穩，但全國其他地區物價激漲，勢將影響本市之管制工作，蔣氏爲此特呈請中揠擬定辦法，平抑其他各地之物價。蔣督導員執行工作，完全恪遵行政院之命令，外傳其擅作主張，完全不確。</p>

<h3>熱河保衛戰後一段小插曲　承德市縱囚追囚</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　邢若風</p>
<p>〔本報承德廿二日航訊〕承德最近發生了一構縱囚追囚的事件。這在戡亂剿匪的今天來講，戒嚴令下。是有這樣「臨時措施」的法令規定，本不算什麽奇事，不過這在千五百年前唐太宗六年演過的「縱囚」一劇，重現在今天原子時代的舞台上，雖然時代不同，治亂逈異，然而唐代的滑稽戲，千百年後却又無獨有偶了。</p>
<p>當本年五月十一日熱西戰火燃起後，十三日綏靖區司令部戒嚴令下，當時承德總體戰的態勢，軍民同愾，堅軔無比，一面集中指揮，統一攻守，一面採取非戰鬥員的人口疏散政策，藉以减輕城內的食糧消耗。熱河高等法院與地方法院都準備遷向北平，當然坐牢的犯人要要在疏散之例的。</p>
<p>承德監獄　當時收押的各種犯人，計有已決犯一七九名，未決犯一五四名，總數是二百卅三名，案件的種類是製毒與吸毒的犯人佔總數三分之二，餘爲奸匪，盜匪，竊盜，詐欺，及殺人，貪汚等犯，各類人犯多寡不同。</p>
<p>五月廿八日，典獄長楊徵依照「緩靖區各監所人犯臨時處理辦法」，請准石覺司令官的認可後，卽着手施行疏散。疏散的方法是：將已判決的重犯十六名移送北平收監（奸匪盜匪殺人犯在內）二百零九名交保釋放，不能取保的有十八名，經由軍方以卡車一載送雙塔山，每名賞了二升米，</p>
<p>驅逐出境了。這樣至六月三日圓滿的疏散完畢，高地兩院的職員也就平安飛平了，　於是被驅逐出境的犯人，既蒙恩赦，復邀賞賜，於感激驚喜之餘，樂得溜之大吉。取保釋放的犯人，以爲「交保」是應付官塲的手續，幸得這千載一時的機會，出得獄來，身心悠悠，但承德米珠薪桂，多歡也就無意留戀似的各奔他鄉謀生去了。昔年歐陽修說：「夫意其必來而縱之，是上賊下之情也。意其必免而復來，是下賊上之心也。」關於這兩項揣摩，當時似乎誰也不會有道閒情逸致，而這些被假釋了的犯人，沒有想到事後再回來，當然也是人之常情了。</p>
<p>六月中旬，承德保術戰勝利閉幕後，市面逐漸</p>
<p>恢復常態，而高地兩院的大部職員，因交通關係，却依然留在北平。直至八月末，始能少數的陸續回返。於是追囚」之議，才又舊案重提。九月一日，承德監獄長發出佈吿，謂：凡被保釋的犯人，『依照「綏靖區各監所人犯臨時處理辦法」規定，其分別保釋或開釋解放在案，依上項辦法第六條後段規定「於秩序恢復時佈吿，限期報到，如逾期不到，卽行追保或通緝」。現本市宣吿解嚴，恢復常態，合亟佈吿，仰各犯一體遵照，務於佈吿後五日內，逕至本　或附近警察官署報到，如逾期不到，定卽依法追保或通緝，切勿觀望延誤爲要』。現在，已屆九月下旬，佈吿上所限的日期，顯已逾限「延誤」了。</p>
<p>記者爲此，特走訪承德監獄，該獄總務課長姜法鈞，正在開會研討獄中事務。據姜氏談：「追囚」的佈吿張貼後，截至九月十五日。</p>
<p>歸獄報到的人犯僅有兩名：一名是吸毒犯楊志民，廿三歲，已判徒刑一年六月，至十一月一日期滿。一是竊盜犯任雲恒，四十三歲，已判徒刑四個月，但扣除保釋期間已超適刑期了。此外，大批人犯，都早巳離開承德市，刻正積極追保歸案中。另據地院張檢察官談：「犯人逾期不到，依法應構成脫逃罪，但承德環境不同，交通阻隔，消息傳遞也顯　塞，犯人歸期雖逾限，仍能酌情從寬辦理，如果故意逃避，有礙結案，司法機關爲維持跌律的尊嚴，定卽採取嚴追保人並下令通緝」云云。</p>
<p>然則究竟這些犯人能追回多少呢？這答案顯然是無法確定，但據一般的觀察，多數犯人「已經易地謀生去了」，是事實。這些人之中，又多屬於輕罪，其實獄囚們，每名每日發廿五兩官米，另有副食費，這待退也許比他們在家里吃得好，其所以不歸案的主因，似乎倒不一定全爲了逃避。不過，如果一去不返，一直」延誤」下去，那就難免要嚴追保人與下令通緝了。而古代的三百囚犯，縱後及期『而卒自歸無後者」的壯舉，也就只好讓　人專美於前了。</p>
<h3>刮目看丹陽　濬墾練湖初步成功</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　李天行</p>
<p>〔本報武進廿五日訊〕在京滬綫上，丹陽不消說是一個荒瘠的小縣份，人口僅四十餘萬，民情，風俗，旣不像江南，又不像蘇北，方言尤爲複雜，漫說與蘇常不同，鎮寗不同，就在丹言丹，城鄉說話固不同，卽東南西北四個城門的說話，也就各有不同之處，丹陽話固然難懂，而尤其難說，一個外縣人學習一二句南京·鎭江·蘇州·上海的方言，並不困難，可要學習一二句丹陽土話，却相當的吃力。政治·經濟·文化·都相當落後。加上抗戰初期，東戰塲敵人瘋狂的飛機炸彈，大砲火力，把丹陽全城毀滅了百分之八十以上。一片領垣斷壁，使這雲陽古曲阿的城頭，格外黯然無光。</p>
<p>可是隨勝利以俱來，丹陽卽吿新生。束雲章先生做了丹陽的救星。束是丹陽人，自幼十餘歲卽離開故鄉跑到了北方天津，幾十年的奮門，成就了事業，爭得了地位，現在已是六十開外的人了。飲水思源，愛護桑梓，早謀建設家鄉，勝利那年起，就在北門外車站附近，首先建立了一個高高的烟突，開創了丹陽紗廠資本總額五百億，廠屋完全新建，現在一萬支紗錠，日夜在輪轉，每月可出紗七百餘件，大部廿支細紗，牌子是「丹鳳朝陽」，熱銷常州上海一帶，機器全爲美國一九四一年貨，在中國當屬新型，而省人工。尙有一萬錠機器已到齊，正在裝配中。據該廠汪經理說，年內可以吿竣，二萬錠子可全部開工。動力初用戚　堰電廠，現已自備西門子電機一部，自發動力，目前足够運用。此爲丹陽新興工業的第一聲。束氏原來計劃，是紗廠有三萬錠子。另一千台布機一個織廠，再有一個麵粉廠。一個機器廠，以束氏的魄力，次第實現，可不成問題。</p>
<p>束氏第二件難設是濬墾練湖，練湖在丹陽西城外，湖沿接着城郭，又稱練塘，又名曲阿後湖，爲晋郗鑒督練水師處，故名練。面積共一萬五千餘畝，伊昔東接通運河，西南面承受茅山山脈一帶高地的瀉水，周圍四十餘里，汪洋白水，爲沿湖四周農田五萬畝賴以灌溉的水庫。年久沙積泥漲，湖底淤塞，已成滄海桑田，歷年提議浚墾，限於財力，未成事實，始終是野水范范草靑靑，成爲丹陽的缺憾。迨束雲軍歸來，登高一呼，指揮如意，事情方始也有辦法，濬墾機構，首先組織，一委員會，專責其事，濬墾目標和方針，一半是把湖疏濬，確保沿湖四周五萬畝農田的水利，一半是劃出東南半　的湖，墾耕成田。開闢阡陌，建築新村，長隄栽花植樹，湖內養魚種荷。用科學方法來求生產，來佈置風景，以別墅，以游艇，以新的姿態，來建設新型的練湖，繁榮整個的丹陽。所以遠景很美　，不但不涉空想，而且踏實的</p>
<p>第一期濬　資金，束氏捐了一百卅億。丹陽縣　　動用一千石丹陽紗廠負担一千二百石穀，　林都補款十億。今年春天，就屢開工作。截至到現在，已經獲得初步的成功。第一：</p>
<p>小站兩部完全吿成，地位在練湖東，靠丹陽的北郭。建築完全採用新型，　骨水泥澆鑄。一是司洩入，一司洩出，這是　節練湖水利，保持水位一定的高低。以運河爲吞吐，使無洞泛之患。另組一個機構，專責其事。第二：</p>
<p>兩農墾區也成立了，第一農墾區，廣六百畝。在練湖東南端，依附城郭。墾田工作初夏開始，設農墾委會專司其事。四圍作玗，並作深溝，彌望平面，五百餘畝，全部種粳　稻。一片還綠，瀨漫如海，稻穗垂垂，結棍而又挺拔，使人看了興奮。今年已預定有鹽滿的秋收。負責人吿訴記者：每畝榖至少可收六至七百斤，工本約每畝一石米。生產不落空，盈餘給人以更大的興奮。負責人談論語氣也覺得有勁！第二墾區，現正在積極着手動工開墾中，築堤已完成。四千四百餘畝將大面積，平放在前面，等待着出籠。據農墾鄒主任說：今秋一定可以種下麥，種子已由蘇省農改所貸種一萬七千餘斤，尙嫌不够。全國關心農村復興，農業革新的人們，也紛紛來到丹陽察勘。本月十九日，晨林部　　芳毛　，金大農院章之汶，農業專家鄒秉文·　潤之等都會師練湖，實地考察，並予祥細計劃。目的是積極開發，而彼此想在練湖身上創造一個新的奇蹟。晚風前，太陽西照，在稻花香，落霞紅的時候，一羣四五十個農夫荷錫肩　，赤脚　　，很精壯，很舒適的做完了工，回到農墾辦事處休息，這鏡頭，眞切地反映出了工作的偉大，和建設的偉大。除農墾水站外還有一個專司養殖機構，就是利用水區，以養魚養鷄養鴨等工作爲主。一部份魚苗池子，滿滿的。一部份生長成的魚已放入河溝畜養。丹陽市上，已多練湖魚，將來魚蝦蟹，當然吃不盡。鷄鴨的畜養當然是事業一部份，只還待着計劃，待着切實的做。</p>
<p>這種新生的開展，衝動了全丹的老百姓，也使每一個外來旅客，要刮目相看丹陽。過客記者，巡禮之餘，不禁十分興奮，爰奮筆疾書，急爲報導，以吿國人，深願古老中國各省縣市，聞風興起，以建設爲第一，以新生爲至上，向丹陽看齊！</p>

<h3>提前清償法幣公債　財部頒發注意事項　同八月十九日以前業已到期之債票　仍照原定償還辦法不得申請加倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行　廳局頃准財政部覺吿，以政府法幣公債處理辦法，業舉行政院核定公佈，提前淸償，依照規定，自民國三十七年十月一日開始辦理，自應如期實施。茲爲持票人及經理銀行申請辦理，有所依據起見，特再擬定政府法幣公債提前淸償辦理注意事項，央行國庫局接獲財部代電及該項提前淸償辦理注意事項後，已通知各分行處查照辦理。茲將是項　注意事項分誌如下：</p>
<p>一，財政部依照政府法幣公價處理辦法之規定，指定中央銀行及其委託銀行經理政府法幣公債提前淸償事務，國外並委託中國銀行辦理。</p>
<p>二，上項辦法所規定提前淸償之公債，係以歷年實際銷售，領發　票，在民國卅七年八月十九日尙未到期還淸之本息票爲限。其在該日以前，業巳到期者，應申持票人自行檢出，照原定償還辦法，另向經理銀行折合金圓，兌領本息，不得混入朱到期本息票內，甲請加倍淸償。</p>
<p>三，凡政府不經實際銷售而撥作銀行借款抵押品之法幣公債，由財政部另行處理，不在前項規定提前淸償之列。但持票人所有之法幣公債，如有充作私人借款抵押品者，仍予提前淸償。</p>
<p>四，上項提前淸償各價加倍計算標準，匯照政府法幣公債處理辦法附表所定，並另對利息扣除所得稅計算之。</p>
<p>五，持原人申請提前清償時，應先向經理銀行領取申請書，將所持之債票名稱種類張數金額附帶息票張數，暨應兌領金圓數額，詳細塡明，加蓋名章，並在債票有上角加蓋同樣名章，繳交經理銀行請兌。</p>
<p>六，經理銀行收到持票人所送申諸書及債票，應逐張核對暗記，與樣張是否相符，號碼有無在卅七年八月十九日以前已到期，或經掛失作廢，停止支付之債票。並檢查應繳息票張數，有無缺少等等。經查均無錯誤後，卽行兌付。如不及卽時兌付者，得先掣給收據，約期兌付。</p>
<p>七，上項查核無誤，准予兌付之本息票，應由經理銀行打洞作廢。並按向例，由經理銀行總行彙送財政部核銷。</p>
<p>八，各債最近一期，在卅七年八月二十日以後到期之息票，應隨同本票，一併申請償付。如有缺少，某該期應領息金，不予償付。惟廿五年復興公債，廿六年救國公債，及廿九年軍需公債第一期債票等三種，均爲最近兩期，在卅七年八月廿日以後到期之息票。</p>
<p>如持票人祇繳上項最近一期（或兩期）之息票，而未繳本票者，應准償付。但此項息票加倍拆算金圓，不足一分者，按四捨五入計算償付。</p>
<p>除上項最近一期（或兩期）息票外，以後各期之息票，如有缺少，應由持票人登報聲明作廢後，方准申請淸償。</p>
<p>九，提前淸償之各種法幣公債，其利息所得稅，照持票人應領息金加倍所得之總數，依率扣繳。所得稅在金圓以下者，以四捨五入計算。</p>
<p>十，經理銀行辦理法幣公債提前淸償事務，遇有特殊情形，應卽報請財政部核辦。</p>
<p>十一，提前淸償期間，定自民國卅七年十月一日開始，至卅八年三月卅一日爲止。持票人逾期尙未申請淸償者，所有債票一律作廢？，</p>
<p>十二，此注意事項，應由各地經理銀行點貼公佈，俾衆週知。</p>
<h3>到貨稀少去化見暢　食米求過於供　雜糧堅昂油市迫近漲限</h3>
<p>食米交易益見冷落，到貨稀少，北市登記到貨二百九十四石，南市一千四百七十二石，故供應仍稀，不但粳米寥　，且秈米亦爲少數矣。若干高貨米，雖有行情而無交易，僅碾秈，杜稱，略有成交，甫卽出樣，一購而空，後市卽無一貨應甫。</p>
<p>麵粉仍無做開，若廠方不開售，交易僵局暫難展開。又配粉照常，每三日配出並不中止。</p>
<p>雜糧堅昂，交易寥寥，黃豆供少，本街難以　進·苞米出日已稀，成交二三百包，紅糧仍爲十元，元麥客化活絡，交易尙多。豌豆站原盤，蠶豆交易極少，芝蔴因去化呆木，獨吿痰五角，生仁未開。</p>
<p>食油徐徐挺升，生油因距限價已進，故始終平定，凈生油仍爲五九·九〇元，豆油廠方開出尙多，價大致爲五十元，計挺八角。生菜油爲四十七元，上漲一元，迫近限價。熟菜油再升一元五角，小車蔴油以限成交。豆餅供應稀寂，大統餅開二百片。</p>
<h3>銀錢等業議定　利率再度抑低</h3>
<p>銀錢信託業三公會，爲遵照當局明令，自下月一日起，將存放日拆利率再予抑低。訂定放款日拆每千元一元六角，存數日拆五角，　業放款日拆一元，業經三公會昨日舉行會議決定，屆時當通知各會員一體辦理。</p>
<h3>財政部重行調整　票據交換保證金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃自中央銀行獲悉，幣制改革後，所有各行莊繳納票據交換保證金額，自應予以調整。茲經規定，除上海應由交換所商定外，所有天　廣州南京北平漢口靑島重庭　陽西安昆明成都　省市，每一行莊，　各　　　一萬　。無錫吳縣鐵江武進常熟徐州江都杭州鄭縣紹興永　　山餘姚蚌埠蕪湖南昌九江福州廈門中山南海新會萬安台山汕　桂林蒼梧長沙衢陽武昌沙市宜昌內江宜賓萬縣　縣樂山自贊貴陽濟南開封鄭州太原蘭州變鵝台北台中彰化基　高雄等市縣，每一行莊應各繳金圓五千圓。除以上各市縣以外，其餘各地均繳納金圓三千圓。該行又通函各分行處查照辦理。</p>
<h3>棉紗交易清淡　布疋籌碼少價格堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因傳限價有調整之說，業內人心頗多躊躇，有貨者售意轉　，買賣雙方咸抱觀望，塲內交易復趨　稀，但外運依然不通，客帮絕鮮進吸，本街以禁止携運，門銷不暢，納胃亦細，惟零星去化仍不寂寞。</p>
<p>市上四十二支細供應祇金雙鷄及紅人鐘兩牌，四十支金城等價俱暗秀十元，卅二支升三·五元，廿一支雙馬仍售七百八十三元限度，粗紗二十支彩魁星軋降外，餘都照限有成交。</p>
<p>十六支繁銷紗甚鮮做開，雜牌略有交易，十支童子軍等因有申新紗廠開售二百八十六件，中以十支紗較多，貨主吐齊，因此行情反見不振。紡建公司續開二十支九獅一牌，價仍站七百元，全。成交祇有三百零一包。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市政况，以今爲辦理存貨登記最後一天，同業忙於登記之事，致塲內交易稀疏，至一般執有登記貨之店號，以手續方辦妥，大都暫取觀望，團戶等以客地市氣轉倘，業中以市上銀根鬆弛，並傳紗布南運，將根據粵閩台灣三地之實需，核實供應，人心更形向榮，籌碼較寡，市勢驟昂。</p>
<p>十二磅龍頭細布，初盤微秀二角，開後供源不充，客帮及本街門莊帮搜求孔　，行情再度上升至廿七元八角，午收以廿七元六角結束，比之上日猛跳一元二角。B字龍頭亦好九角，五福及中檔喇叭童寶貝等細布，四君子元嗶嘰直貢，亦各升自三角至一元餘，亦有不少漲達限度，全日成交因求過於供，數量較少三分之二，祇有一千一百八十疋。</p>
<h3>人絲配價不動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局於昨日另開人絲會議，決定本月廿七日至十月二日之人造絲牌價，仍維持上週價格，義大利人絲每箱仍售一千零三十三元三角。又該局最近有四十箱人造絲運往天津，配供天津各廠供用云。</p>
<p>又訊：人絲市况，因同業來源不繼，執戶大多觀望，在限價下，售者稀少，市况冷落。</p>
<p>來源不斷要求調劑</p>
<p>人絲商業同業公會，前爲擁護幣制改革之國策，經將八一九以前所有存貨，逐日交由公會，依照限價配售，月餘來，因來源不議，存底日簿，而需要轉殷，特向物資調節會要求調劑。</p>
<h3>食糖止跌轉升</h3>

<h3>中等以上學校開辦經常費　暫照戰前數額改訂　期能切實施行漸次提高</h3>
<p>〔本報廿九日南京電〕中等以上學校開辦經常各費，在職前原有確定標準，遵照施行，抗戰以來，幣　波動，雖經敎都將該項標準迭次調整，終無法與物價指數確切配合，以致標準降低，學校浮濫增設，流弊百出。茲幣制改革，有關經費數字各法規均須重行改訂，敎部爲謀鞏固學校基礎，充實內容，認爲學校經費自應以恢復職前標準爲宜，惟目前社會經濟情形，因難仍多，爲兼顧事實，暫照戰前所定經費數額，改以金圓爲單位，折合戰前幣値，僅及原定標準之一半，期能切實施行。俟將來社會經濟情形好轉，再行漸次　高，以期達到戰前原定標準。並經敎育部訓令參字第五二七四六號通飭遵照。自此項標準頒行後，原訂私立中等以上學校開辦費及每年經常費最低數額表卻予廢止，各校應卽依照新標準辦理。原有學校經費不足者，並應限期實令增籌，呈報備核。新設學校，必須先行籌足經養，方可准予設立。</p>

<h3>杭州游踪</h3>
<p>— 寄漠</p>
<p>近來很少讀到游記這一類文字，也許因爲非職業文人　忙中抽不出空閑去旅行，而職業文人則鑒於費用的浩大，爲了寫文章找題材的緣故，還是花錢買些參攷　的得計。因此，我們卽使偶然在報上讀到些記某地長物的文字，也以摭拾些掌故，發揮一些見解者居多，離開「能令讀者作臥游」的境界，似乎還遠得很。</p>
<p>筆者雖久巳有出游之意，一直到最近，因事伴敝友赴杭州，才了却平日的願望。</p>
<p>我們在天色陰晦的一天早晨，乘七時零五分的早車出發。滬杭道上的田野風景與京滬道上相仿。但是點綴在稻田間的房屋，屋角均向上翹，與我們在蘇州慣見者不同。沿途停靠各站如長安·硤石等，似亦不及京滬道上蘇·錫·常等地的富庶。</p>
<p>當天十一時三刻，卽出發後五小時弱，到達杭州，穿過地道，步出車站，回頭一看鐵路車站的建築物，係用石塊鎭刻各種圖案，頗似宮殿，亦似一座廟宇，頗爲壯觀。</p>
<p>走出車站，就是廣闊，柏油馬路，往來車輛，絡繹不絕。我們要到岳王墳去，洋車夫索價金圓六角至一元不等，後來向路人探詢，改在車站附近乘一路公共汽車，票價每人祗法幣二十餘萬元。駛至湖濱，換乘永華公司的汽車，直抵岳墳街下車，車資也祗法幣三十五萬元。</p>
<p>在途中及車上所見，發現杭州女人的裝束，十分樸素。　髮的僅佔十之二三。她們還穿着毫不摩登的「籃球鞋」，取其堅固　穿。返滬後還聽一位杭州籍的同　說，衛生衫及汗衫在當地尙有銷路，羊毛衫則無人問津，於此亦可見杭州風氣儉樸的一斑。</p>
<p>且說，我們到了岳王墳後，卽入岳王廟去瞻仰。鄙見岳王廟一定是後來附加的建築物。最初僅有墳地，而後建立廟宇，添建供奉岳氏父母的祠堂。因此，我們定至岳王墳前，覺得構造很簡單，甚至不及富室墓園的宏偉。墓前有石翁仲·石馬·石羊各一對。入門處，有世傳秦檜夫婦等跪在地上的石像四座，用柵欄隔了起來。</p>
<p>岳王墳與岳雲墓均作半圓形，外澆水泥。我繞至墓後，察覺水泥的某一處，已有隙縫。露出了裏面的黑色磚石。岳王墓前的石柱上，有最近去世的馮玉祥題的對聯。</p>
<p>岳廟內的另一特徵，爲匾額對聯之多，幾乎排滿大門和屋隅。具名者大半爲軍閥時代的人物，如　永祥·何豐林等，察其用意，無非想附麗於岳廟中，藉以永垂不朽。其奈他們的言行，早已爲世人淡忘了。</p>
<p>從岳廟出來，我仍雇洋車沿西湖拉至旗下，車資每輛三角半。天氣乍晴乍雨，故未能下車，領略西湖美景。鄙見西湖之美，一在遼闊，一望無際。二在恬靜，水波不興，令人有置身世外之感。三在襯托之勝，遠望羣山重　，濃淡有致，不啻一幅絕紗的山水畫。</p>
<p>洋車拉至旗下後，我們雖在火車上已略進茶食，此時頗感飢陽轆轆，就踅入一家門面裝璜頗氣槪的×味觀。</p>
<p>餐館內已過午餐時間，顧客寥寥無幾。我們要了半斤酒，點了兩個很簡單的菜。又向店小二問有無時鮮菜肴，他說有炒靑蟹一種，定價每盆三元，我們嫌價昂未點。敝友又索蛤蜊火腿。店小二回稱已售罄，於是我們就已點之菜，慢慢的吃起來。</p>
<p>這其間，我們却給「刨了黃瓜兒」。因爲我們回到上海後，才發現店中開列的帳單內，將未送來的蛤蜊火腿列入。按當時店內顧客稀少，故意錯誤較疏忽誤列的可能性更大。希望讀者游杭州時上該館進食者注意，勿蹈筆者的覆職。</p>
<p>餐畢，我們至杭州的市區徜徉。官巷口三元坊，淸和坊一帶，商店林立。各重要銀行均設於此·街角上警察用口笛指揮交通，亦與用紅綠燈者不同。</p>
<p>筆者因羈於俗務，當天卽與敝友搭下午七時的夜車返滬。好在滬杭交通便科，杭州又有相熟的朋友可供膳宿，且待來日第二次游杭時，再仔細咀嚼各處名勝罷。何况一位杭州人吿訴我們，單是西湖內外，要玩上十五天，才能游徧各處，也不是三數天內可能暢游呢。</p>
<h3>為人設想</h3>
<p>— 陳煙帆</p>
<p>常常爲人設想是一種處世的美德，也是使你得到多一點的人生意義和趣味的鑰匙。甲和乙是脾氣很不相投的兩個人，但是他們二人却是時常可以見面的熟人。有一次，我到丙的家裏去，看見甲在那裏，他也是去看丙先生的。後來，乙也來了，乙也是要找丙先生要談些什麼事的。丙先生走開了，剩下甲和乙坐在書房裏，大家一言不發，甚至通看都不看一眼。兩個熟人像仇敵一樣，眞是難看，然而也好笑。我看了可幾乎要笑出來了。</p>
<p>可是丙先生有一樣好處：他是無論什麽樣的人都瞭解。固執沉悶的人，快樂浮燥的人，他一樣的喜歡。他常常爲人設想，細察別人的脾氣，在他好像試穿花樣不同的衣服一樣。在兩個性情不相同的人之間，你可以發見：他們之間一定有一個人抱有不少成見，以爲「乙永遠是小孩子。」「乙永遠是不成器的。那麽幼稚，淺薄。」乙呢，一定想：「他眞傲慢。他常常在看不起我。」諸如此　，以至話不投機半句多，索性兩個人雖然同在一室，也是各不問話，好像有什麼宿怨似的。我不懂：他們爲什麼把稍稍一些的差異看成如此嚴重呢？</p>
<p>仔細看看每一個人的性情脾氣，實在是一樁很有味趣的　情。不但看看別人，有時有一個閒暇看看自己也何嘗不如此。吝嗇的人爲什麼這樣？兇惡自私的人爲什麼那樣？暴燥的人，刻薄多計的人，僞善的人，他們都是有趣的。有一次一個暴燥組俗的人向我發脾氣，可是我正看着他暴怒的表情好笑。雖然沒有笑出來，可也沒有把他沒意思的駡人話聽進去。雖然吃了虧，還且替找人便宜的人設想—我常常如此。也許是懦弱的表示，可是我的這種選擇是自然的，因爲我以爲這是比較適合我的。</p>
<p>有人說，某某的脾氣很怪。因爲他平時落落寡合，忽然要發脾氣駡人。有人說，某老太太很討厭，因爲她出奇的吝嗇，同時絮絮叨叨的駡傭人，駡子姪。也許多和他們接近接近，揣摩他們的性格和內心的苦處，冬替他們設想，我們便會發現他們並不可怪和討厭。人的性格和行爲是一層一層的，西洋某名作家說：「每一個人都像一本書」，也許就是這個意思吧。</p>
<h3>限價與節約</h3>
<p>— 錢大成</p>
<p>節約運動自倡導以來，各方反應都極端良好，報上常見表示擁護的專電。但是，專實上究竟如何呢？</p>
<p>我在本鄉茶館裏目覩到一班茶客，呌點心的時候，饅頭明明是限價法幣五萬元一個，燒餅七萬元一個；但偏偏有好多人拉直了喉嚨呌人去定做十萬元十五萬一個的饅頭，十五萬元二十萬元一個的　餅，表示他們的闊綽，唯恐點心賣得太賤，簡直是鼓勵漲價。—社會風報如此，政府限價有仕麽用？這種風氣一時難得轉變，政府提倡節約，但是官吏們如不能身體力行，只訂些節約條例和貼些標語又有什麽用呢？中秋節前，這兒的高級官長下手令不許下屬送禮。但我在街頭看到不少穿中山裝掛徽章的公務人員，手裏提着禮物，怱怱來去，却沒有聽到過上司把下屬的禮物擲回，雖是他們已遠背了高級官長的手令。或許他們認爲「王道不外乎人情」，雖有皇皇手令，但下屬們的一點孝心，也不能不領受吧？鳴呼人情！偉大哉人情！專講人情，還談什麽限價？還談什麼節約？闊人不肯節約，小百姓本來已苦不堪言，談不上節約。如果闊人們自己肯節約，上行下效，養成以儉爲美德的風氣，那就用不到訂什麽條例，也不用貼標語，也不用限價，太貴的東西自然不會有人要買。然而要養成這種良好的風氣，豈能一蹴而幾。退而求其次，政府限價和提倡節約一時旣收不到效果，還不如對那些閥人施以多方面的壓力或制裁。同時在上者以身作則，不再授人以口實，或許有一點辦法。但是節約還終是治標的辦法；治本的辦法，只有努力生產。標本並治之後，限價這個名詞就可無形中消失了。以上云云，祗是書生之見。恐怕有人在旁竊笑爲「酸葡萄主義」吧？</p>
<h3>何妨一試</h3>
<p>— 萬里</p>
<p>（一）寫下你家的門牌號數。</p>
<p>（二）乘上「二」，</p>
<p>（三）加上「五」，</p>
<p>（四）乘上「五十」，</p>
<p>（五）加上你的歲數，</p>
<p>（六）加上「三百六十五」，</p>
<p>（七）减去「六百十五」。</p>
<p>你就可以得到一個奇怪的數字，這數字的前一段是你家的門牌號數，後一段是你的歲數。</p>
<h3>郁達夫的生年</h3>
<p>— 陳從周</p>
<p>日前陸丹林先生在本刊的「郁達夫遺囑」一支，據他所引乙酉元旦預立遺囑，說民三十四年（乙酉）郁先生已五十四歲，那末以此排算，到今年該是五十七歲了。據我知道，這個年份恐有錯誤。我姑且根據郁先生哭徐志糜的「志摩在回憶裏」一文有輓志摩二聯，一聯上說：「新詩傳宇宙，竟爾乘風歸去，同學同庚，老友如君先宿草。　華表托　靈，何當化鶴重來，一生一死，深　有婦賦招魂」。他文上自已說是宣統二年（一九一〇）杭州府中的同班同學，志摩是光緒二十二年丙申（一八九六）年生的，那末郁先生同庚的話該是一八九六年生，以此推算，今年當是五十三歲，不會如陸先生文上所載距離如此之遠。我恐怕有人以爲他自己寫的遺囑一定沒有錯誤，然而容有傳抄失檢，假如眞的遺囑上是五十四的話，這遺囑就恐怕有問題了。決無自己在遺囑上尙不肯眞書年歲的人。往昔朱古微不肯說自己眞年齡，可是到死前是通知况又韓先生的，那是一例。書此以報陸先生，諒當苜肯也。</p>

<h3>Stuart Little Leaves the United States to Return to China, Explaining the Responsibilities of Each Company Under the Industrial Fittings Plan; Must Complete Work with the Lowest Cost and Shortest Time</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Economic Cooperation Administration in this city] The responsibilities of each project engineering company under the Economic Cooperation Administration's $35 million aid to China industrial fittings plan were solemnly stated on the 29th from Washington.</p>
<p>Stuart Little, head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's Technical Investigation Team, announced at a press conference: "The engineering companies hired by the beneficiaries of this plan must execute each project at the lowest cost and in the shortest possible time." After the meeting, Mr. Stuart Little left Washington for Shanghai and will arrive here early next week.</p>
<p>As of today, 14 engineering projects totaling $22.5 million have been provisionally approved under the fittings program. The above program is part of the $275 million total American aid implemented by Mr. Lapham.</p>
<p>The selection of all engineering projects aims to provide the greatest benefit to China's industrial economy. Its smooth progress will greatly increase the need for work in China's major textile, sugar, electricity, and railway enterprises and related industries.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart Little stressed that only experienced engineering companies will be employed in this plan, which can speed up the project and achieve high efficiency.</p>
<p>Among the enterprises currently receiving assistance, the Jibei Electric Power Company, the Yangzi Electric Power Company, the Kailuan Coal Mine, and the Taiwan Jingye Corporation have already selected their engineers. According to Mr. Stuart Little, the other ten enterprises have been urged to appoint them as soon as possible. Mr. Stuart Little also said: "In contacting the engineering business of various enterprises, each engineering company can enjoy equal opportunities, such as the Taiwan Railway Company."</p>
<p>Engineering companies should receive reasonable remuneration for their services, but the calculation method is not based on a certain percentage, because the nature and quantity of various tasks are not the same in terms of currency value.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart Little also said: "Under the procedure of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the relationship between each engineering company and enterprise is professional in nature. The engineering company must represent each enterprise in procuring fittings with the most favorable prices and delivery terms all over the world, and will do its best to obtain competitive prices."</p>
<p>In order to save time and money, and to assist other countries engaged in reconstruction plans, all materials used in this plan will be procured not only in the United States, but also in other countries under the Wuxieer Plan and in Japan. In addition, the remaining materials stored by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Property Custody Committee, the Materials Supply Bureau, and other agencies will also be utilized. This method can save part of the expenditure in US dollars and extend the execution time of the plan.</p>
<p>Observers in Washington call this plan a "new approach." In order to maximize its efficiency in execution, each project engineer must sign a service pledge and be countersigned by the executor of the plan, certifying the following points: (1) Based on appropriate technical investigation, this plan should produce the intended effect. (2) Comprehensive investigations have been conducted in procurement to ensure the most favorable prices and delivery terms. (3) The engineering company must submit a specification guaranteeing that materials will be procured and equipment installed in the fastest and most economical manner. (4) Progress reports must be submitted at any time as required.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart Little also said: "When the project engineers submit a draft of the above-mentioned pledge, they must discuss the relevant remuneration, material procurement methods, and competitive quotations with the technical team. If necessary, material reports will be held in sealed quotations."</p>
<p>The above-mentioned technical country will be represented by a special engineering company hired by the Chinese government. The task of the company will be to serve as a consultant and supervising engineer for the Sino-American Industrial Construction and Fittings Joint Committee under American Aid.</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Critique of Zhang Qun's "Impressions of Japan"</h3>
<p>Former Premier Zhang Qun, after returning from an inspection tour of Japan, compiled his findings and broadcast them to the nation on the evening of the 28th of this month. The full text was published in this newspaper yesterday. This speech is more important than the "Message to the Japanese People" he delivered in Japan. It painstakingly presents his observations during his three weeks in Japan and expresses considerable satisfaction. It concludes with a call for an Asian century, with both appeals and expectations. At a time when the United Nations General Assembly is being held in Paris and the concept of regional security is gaining widespread support, Zhang Qun's "Impressions of Japan" undoubtedly carries profound significance and will have a far-reaching impact on Asia.</p>
<p>The content of this speech includes observations from many perspectives. Regarding his view of Japan, he expressed considerable satisfaction with Japan under MacArthur's control. He explained that under this control, Japan's military has been dismantled, and its police force is very weak. The Maritime Safety Agency only has vessels to prevent smuggling and no armed forces. Therefore, he is certain that Japan cannot rebuild a national defense force sufficient to cope with the next major war. Politically, the new Japanese constitution limits the power of the Emperor, and the symbolic Emperor cannot become a god. The Allied forces have completely separated politics and religion. In particular, MacArthur's support for "centrist politics" and the purging of remnants of militarism lead him to believe that "Japanese-style theocratic fascist politics will not easily rise again." However, Zhang said, "Establishing a democratic system is relatively easy, but cultivating a democratic mindset and a democratic way of life is still difficult." Economically, he believes that Japan's current economic situation is far from self-sufficiency, let alone economic recovery. He cited the dissolution of the zaibatsu and the implementation of land reform, with 40% of the materials imported under the five-year plan coming from Asia and 50% from the dollar area. Therefore, he concludes, "Japan cannot re-establish a militaristic regime threatening peace based on its economic conditions, and the key lies in our hands in China." Finally, he pointed out that the construction of the world in the future will center on Asia, and the Asian century has already begun. Our handling of the Japan issue should not only be passively non-retaliatory but also actively constructive. How should we be constructive? Summarizing Zhang's views, there are the following points: (1) We should abandon passive and unhelpful suspicions towards Japan, and China should establish a proactive policy towards Japan; (2) From the perspective of the overall interests of Asian nations and the permanent relationship between China and Japan, we should take far-sighted measures to promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan; (3) We must ensure that Asian nations jointly obtain freedom from want before we can truly obtain freedom from fear. The Japan issue is an Asian issue, and considering and handling the Japan issue within the context of the entire Asian issue will naturally lead to correct solutions to all historical grievances and post-war anxieties.</p>
<p>We are not entirely in agreement with Zhang's speech and its premature conclusions on the current situation in Japan. However, we admire his thoughtful and far-sighted view of the future of Asia. We would like to express our views and discuss them with Zhang and the nation:</p>
<p>First, Zhang Qun's visit to Japan lasted three weeks, and he must have gathered a great deal of information. Zhang's assertion that Japan under MacArthur's control is virtually free of causes for suspicion and fear in terms of military affairs, politics, and economics is overly optimistic. First of all, Japan's economic recovery is a fact. If this recovery is not carried out under the joint supervision and control of the Allied nations, it could become a prelude to the revival of militarism. This is the general view of Allied politicians. More than 40% of the raw materials imported under Japan's economic plan come from Asia, with a large portion of the raw material supply sought from China, and a large portion of its manufactured goods are marketed in China. This is still the old path of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." In particular, the current stage of Japanese politics has not thoroughly achieved "ideological revolution" and "psychological construction." In other words, political democratization and economic democratization have not taken root from the ground up. Therefore, we cannot readily believe that Japan's economic recovery will not threaten China. In order to thoroughly clarify the Japan issue, we agree to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, conclude a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions, and truly promote the democratization of the Japanese economy under the supervision of the Allied nations in order to achieve political democratization. The current stage of Japanese politics is still far from the path of true democratization.</p>
<p>Second, Zhang's point that the center of the world is in Asia is the most accurate view. Nehru made the same call on India's Independence Day, which was deeply valued by the people of Asia. Asia occupies one-third of the Earth's land area, has one-half of the world's population, covering 18 million square miles, and with 1.3 billion people. Europeans and Americans say that the era of humanity has moved from Babylon and Egypt to Rome, and now it has returned to Asia. The current world is caught in a bipolar struggle, but the true thinking and path for humanity are not in the two poles. As the ancients said, "Truth is not in this extreme or that extreme, but in the middle of the two extremes." The Asian century is the century in the middle of the two extremes. It is sublimated from thousands of years of thought and historical experience and has a highly enlightened and moderate philosophical foundation. We sympathize with Zhang's far-sighted call and hope that, with our country as the center, we can hold an Asian international conference with Asian countries, especially the newly emerging ones, to establish pan-Asian peace and economic prosperity. Nehru once said: Asia cannot abandon Japan, and it is unwise to completely suppress the Japanese nation. We believe that after a thorough ideological revolution, Japan should be led onto a path of true peace and brightness.</p>
<p>In summary, solving the Japan issue from the perspective of the overall interests of Asia is the correct approach. However, we should not have excessive expectations for the current situation in Japan. Because the peace conference has not been held, the peace treaty has not been signed, and the new Japan of common ideals of the Allied nations has not yet appeared, we cannot be too optimistic about the Japan issue.</p>

According to the Financial Management Bureau, after the implementation of the military grain coupons, the roaming funds from the Northeast entering the customs can be reduced by at least 60%. However, the entry of cash from Shenyang is still free, and the central government should immediately find ways to control it.</p>

Furthermore, Xie Fanghui, the manager of the Chongqing branch of the Sichuan Provincial Bank, embezzled silver dollars and fled. This was due to previous deficits, and the seized assets are sufficient to cover the public funds.</p>

<h3>Nickel Coin Scandal Continues to Unfold; Guilin Central Bank Manager Also Implicated; Rumored to Have Made Tens of Billions by Exploiting Position</h3>
<p>[Report from our Guilin office on the 29th] Wu Guangming, manager of the Guilin branch of the Central Bank, is under suspicion of significant corruption related to silver coins and has been widely criticized for allegedly exploiting his position. It is alleged that he profited by tens of billions of dollars by delaying the announcement of the order to circulate nickel coins, allowing him to buy them at low prices. Supervisory Committee member Liao Geyi went to the Central Bank to investigate and discovered that the Central Bank received the order to restore the circulation of nickel coins on the 21st of last month but delayed the announcement in the newspapers until the 28th, without a formal public announcement. During this period, there was clear evidence of dereliction of duty and corruption. Liao has decided to bring the matter to the Control Yuan. The Senate and the local court are paying close attention to the case and are collecting evidence to prepare for prosecution.</p>

<p>[Report from our Chongqing office on the 29th] Since August 19th, the daily amount of yarn opened for sale by Chongqing yarn factories has decreased.

According to Qiu Xiufu, the chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, there are over 600 yarn merchants, and tens of thousands of family members rely on them for their livelihood.

<h3>Japanese Strictly Restricting Economic Activities of Overseas Chinese; Liu Qiguang Gives Talk Upon Return to Taiwan from Japan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Taipei office on the 29th] Liu Qiguang, chairman of the Taiwan Hua Nan Bank, who went to Japan as a representative of the trade delegation to Japan, has now returned to Taiwan. He told reporters that this trip yielded no results in terms of trade. The previous rumor of a 200 million yen transaction with Japan is completely unfounded, and it is unlikely that formal trade relations with Japan will occur in the future. The problem is that the materials we are allowed to export are not needed by Japan, and the materials we hope to obtain are prohibited from export by Japan. However, the time spent in Japan allowed for a very detailed and accurate observation of the state of Japanese society and the situation of overseas Chinese after the war. The total number of overseas Chinese currently in Japan is only 29,000, with Taiwanese accounting for slightly more than half. The Japanese estimate their assets to be as high as 30 to 50 billion yen, so Japanese society is very concerned and uneasy about the financial power of overseas Chinese and strictly restricts their economic activities. Actual statistics show that the total value of overseas Chinese assets is no more than 2 billion yen, so it remains to be studied whether the Japanese estimate is deliberately exaggerated. The situation in Japanese society is worse than imagined. The people's lives are difficult. Taking food as an example, each person only receives enough rationed rice for ten days a month, and they must find ways to supplement with coarse grains for the remaining twenty days. Other issues such as clothing and housing shortages are also very serious. The exhaustion of industrial and commercial economy is particularly dire and will not recover in the short term. As for the reported Taiwanese independence movement with underground organizations in Japan, the Taiwanese residing in Japan are unaware of it, nor have they heard of such activities. Only Suzuki Yukio's World Daily News published this news on August 24th and September 23rd with large-character headlines. After inquiry, it was said that it was based on leaflets. However, it should be noted that the Taiwanese residing in Japan are very ignorant of the current situation in Taiwan. They believe that the current situation in Taiwan is even worse than in Japan, which needs to be clarified.</p>

<h3>Allocation of Japanese Reparation Machines; Temporarily Calculated at Half Price; Half a Month Deadline for Payment</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 29th] The prices of Japanese reparation machines allocated to private enterprises as approved by the Allied Headquarters are very high. The Executive Yuan has recently decided that a temporary payment of 50% should be calculated and paid first, and adjustments will be made after the Cooperative Council determines the final price. According to the law, private enterprises purchasing Japanese reparations goods should pay at the statutory exchange rate of 4 gold yuan per US dollar. The payment deadline was also agreed to be September 15th of this year. However, recently, factories such as the Xinmin Machinery Factory have requested that the prices be re-set. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided on two measures through consultation: one is to cooperate with the currency system reform and take the price of August 19th as the standard. The reparations machine tools will be temporarily calculated and paid at 65% of the price approved by the Allied Headquarters, and adjustments will be made after the Cooperative Council determines the final price. The second is the method passed today, which calculates at 50%. The former applies to domestic situations, while the latter applies to international situations. At the same time, in order to have a basis for proposing price reductions at the peace conference in the future, the latter standard should be preferred. The payment deadline will be half a month from the date of promulgation of this measure. Factories and mines in remote areas or with special circumstances may be granted an extension, but it should not exceed one month.</p>

<h3>Based on the Provisions of the United Nations Charter; The Three Powers File a Complaint Against the Soviet Union; Accuse the Blockade of Berlin of Threatening World Peace</h3>
<p>[News Agency Report] Paris, broadcast on the 29th: The United States, Britain, and France formally filed a complaint with the United Nations on the 29th against their wartime ally, the Soviet Union, for threatening world peace through its blockade of Berlin. This formal complaint, in letters with identical text from US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman, was delivered by special envoys to UN Secretary-General Lie. The complaint stated: "I, on behalf of my country, submit to you for your attention the serious situation of the Soviet government restricting transportation and traffic between the Western occupation zones of Germany and Berlin. This action conflicts with the interests of my country related to the occupation and control of Berlin. This action by the Soviet Union violates the obligations stipulated in Article 2 of the United Nations Charter and threatens the peace outlined in Chapter 7 of the Charter. Considering the repeated exchange of documents and negotiations between the three governments and the Soviet Union, the three governments are deeply aware of their obligation to resolve disputes by peaceful means under the provisions of the Charter and have made every effort to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to eliminate the gaps between the three countries and the Soviet Union. The dispute between the Soviet government and the Western powers is not a matter of logistical difficulties in transportation, nor is it an agreement on the conditions for managing the currency in Berlin. The dispute lies in the fact that the Soviet government has clearly expressed through its actions that it is unwilling to fulfill its obligations and attempts to achieve political goals that it should not have and cannot achieve through peaceful means by illegal and coercive means. The country has used blockade methods to threaten the residents of Berlin with starvation and economic collapse, watch the occurrence of riots, and attempt to overthrow the legally elected Berlin Municipal Government. The attitude and behavior of the Soviet government extremely demonstrate its intention to continue to implement illegal and coercive blockades and to use its illegal actions to reduce the position of the United States, France, and Britain from occupying powers in Berlin to a state of complete submission to Soviet power, thereby obtaining absolute power to control the economic, political, and social lives of the residents of Berlin and incorporating the city of Berlin into the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet government has thus created a situation in which it is no longer possible to seek solutions under Article 33 of the United Nations Charter under the current circumstances and has constituted a threat to world peace and security, for which the Soviet government should be solely responsible. In order to prevent the world peace and security from being jeopardized again, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in addition to reserving the full right to take necessary measures to maintain their position in Berlin, have no choice but to submit the actions of the Soviet government to the United Nations Security Council so that the Security Council can consider this issue as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>In Handling the Berlin Issue Dispute; China's Attitude is Pivotal; Foreign Minister Wang is Carefully Reviewing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] A reporter learned today from sources close to the Chinese delegation that China is giving careful consideration to its position on the Berlin issue and will express its position when the issue is submitted to the Security Council. Because China is currently one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, China's position is of great importance. According to Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter, which will be cited regarding the Berlin issue, China is the only one of the five powers that is not a party to the dispute and has the right to use the veto power, while Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union cannot participate in the vote.</p>
<p>Wang Shijie, the head of the Chinese delegation, convened a meeting of all representatives and advisors this morning. At the meeting, a thorough discussion was held on the political and procedural issues related to the Berlin situation. China's position on this issue was also reviewed. However, the Chinese delegation believes that submitting the Berlin issue to the Security Council will involve many technical difficulties.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Plans to Visit Berlin Next Month for Inspection</h3>

<h3>Secretary Marshall Expresses High Praise</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] Marshall praised our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie today. Due to the intense work of studying the volatile Berlin issue, he was unable to immediately comment on Foreign Minister Wang's speech at the UN General Assembly. However, he took time today to tell our reporter: Foreign Minister Wang's statement at the UN General Assembly proves that he has an infinite understanding of international relations and personal integrity.

However, travelers returning from the Soviet Union said that everything is normal in the Soviet Union, except that some police units composed of former prisoners of war are now stationed in various border areas.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Security Council Striving to Defend Hyderabad; Expressing Doubt Over the Withdrawal of the Complaint by the Prince</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] The Security Council failed to achieve anything today in dealing with the Hyderabad dispute, as some representatives expressed doubt over whether the notification of the withdrawal of the case by the Prince of Hyderabad was valid. Our representative, Jiang Tingfu, made a carefully worded defense, saying: We all agree that the notification of the Prince of Hyderabad was personally signed, so there should be no doubt. Other representatives said: The Prince's withdrawal of the case may have been due to pressure from India. Argentine representative Arce said: All notifications were forwarded through India, which is "the wolf speaking for the sheep." (After listening to the statement of the Indian representative, Menon.) The former "Hyderabad representative" of the Security Council did not take any concrete action today. There were two proposals at the meeting, one was Syria's proposal for the Security Council to directly investigate the situation in Hyderabad; the other was Argentina's proposal to continue to request all Indian troops to completely withdraw from Hyderabad.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The United Nations General Assembly resumed its meeting at 9:45 this morning. The first to speak was Bolivian representative Durtins, who strongly urged the General Assembly to allow Spain and Italy to join the United Nations and requested that the General Assembly's recommendation on Spain in December 1946 be deleted. The Bolivian representative's speech marked the beginning of the Latin American countries' attempt to bring Spain back into the international family.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Representative Criticizes the United States; In Cahoots with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj took the floor, strongly supporting the Soviet Union and accusing the West of attempting to undermine the United Nations. Kardelj is the right-hand man of Yugoslav dictator Tito. Although Tito had been expelled by the Cominform, he adhered to the Soviet line of attacking the West and urged the General Assembly to adopt the Soviet disarmament proposal. There was no hint in Kardelj's words that Stalin and Tito had fallen out. He praised the Soviet Union and its communist system as the world's first and greatest hope, but this flattering praise was long gone from the Soviet Union. His remarks did not move Western diplomats, as Yugoslavia is secretly in conflict with the Soviet Union behind the scenes, but on the surface remains in cahoots with the Soviet Union. Kardelj made the following points in accusing the United States: (1) creating and developing West Germany as a military and economic base for the United States in Western Europe; (2) stationing troops in Allied and other countries; (3) "inciting chaos" in the Near East; (4) "rebuilding Japan as an anti-Soviet base"; (5) not fulfilling peace treaties; (6) organizing a vast military base system; (7) refusing to disarm and ban atomic bombs.</p>
<h3>Manuilsky Accuses Bevin of Waving an Atomic Bomb at the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The last speaker was Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky, who accused Britain of dividing Germany and Europe in order to enslave Europeans. Manuilsky also accused British Foreign Secretary Bevin of "waving an atomic bomb at the Soviet Union on this podium." He accused the United States of owning 489 military bases to rule the world. However, his words were mainly aimed at refuting Bevin and Belgian representative Spaak, whom he called "trying to frighten their own people. The Western countries are waving flags and shouting in fear here so that their real plans can hide behind this smoke screen, which is to launch a war against the Soviet and Eastern European democratic countries." After Manuilsky finished his speech, the debate in the General Assembly this morning ended at 11:45, and the General Assembly adjourned temporarily, waiting for notice to reconvene.</p>
<h3>Dewey Pays Close Attention to the Development of the Berlin Issue; He Believes That the United States Cannot Compromise in Principle</h3>
<p>[United Press, Missoula, Montana, 28th] Republican presidential candidate Dewey declared on the 28th that the United States "will not change our principles" in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Berlin crisis. He said, "An ominous threat hangs over the future of the United States, but people must not give up hope for a peaceful resolution." Dewey is in constant contact with the negotiations in Paris on the Berlin issue through US representative Dulles. He said, "Cruel aggression aimed at enslaving mankind is spreading widely around the world. In Berlin, where we have the right to stay under the sacred agreement, we are facing this aggressive country head-on. In the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, our representatives are working side by side with representatives of other free countries to confront the vast superiority, so that even in the last hour, a peaceful resolution can be reached. In the spirit of national unity, we stand side by side with them. We will not compromise on our principles. There is no peace in compromise, and we will not cease our efforts to seek a common basis for agreement, or stop praying for a fair and peaceful solution." Dewey added that it is a tragedy that the country, three years after the end of the war, is still unable to devote all its efforts to developing its resources and achieving economic progress.</p>

<h3>America Has Sufficient Power to Eliminate Communist Forces</h3>

<p>[French News Agency, Oklahoma City, 29th] Truman stated in a campaign speech here on the 28th: America need not fear the participation of communists, nor is there any lack of spies and subversive government elements.

<h3>Reconstruction of War-Torn Far East Regions; American Loans Greatly Needed; Wang Yunwu Speaks at International Monetary Fund</h3>

At the time, President Truman, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder, and others expressed their views on the financial problems of various groups in the world.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Yunwu told the representatives of 47 countries that the world's economic recovery had achieved "noteworthy progress." However, he also said that this progress was still too slow and limited, and not sufficient to compensate for wartime losses and meet the needs of the current emergency situation. Wang further stated that the budgets of many countries are still extremely difficult to cope with international payment deficits, forcing many countries to continue to draw heavily on already greatly reduced US dollar funds. Wang said that without US foreign aid, many representatives attending the current meeting would have to launch fierce struggles for the economic survival of their respective countries, and would not be able to come together as they are now to cooperate in devising ways for a more prosperous and stable world economy. He said: "The existence of the European Recovery Program gives us confidence in the future. The recent actions of the United States guarantee that the construction work of the West will move forward, and the success of the recovery is close to becoming a foregone conclusion." Wang forcefully stated that external assistance is needed for the reconstruction of war-torn areas in the Far East and for the further industrialization of industrially backward areas. He said that in implementing these plans, the economic welfare of the entire world must be the premise.</p>

The defense ministers of the five countries have also agreed to jointly formulate a defense policy to stipulate the military tasks of each country. This joint defense has been included within the scope of the Brussels Treaty and the United Nations Charter, with the aim of seeking the security of the five signatory countries.</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Washington, 29th] It is reported that the State Department has prepared a new military aid plan for the West, preparing to submit it shortly after the 81st Congress convenes next January. This plan will include a "Cold War" lend-lease program, the purpose of which is to support the "Western European Union" when East-West international situations come to a showdown.</p>
<h3>Situation in Berlin Remains Tense; East and West Occupation Zones Hasten to Build Aircraft; Three Powers Consider Evacuating West Berlin Residents</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] Military sources here stated: The authorities in West Berlin are actively rushing to build two new airports, with 17,000 German workers working in shifts around the clock, striving to complete them within the next week. These two new airports can greatly increase the capacity to accommodate large transport aircraft, and the amount of airport construction materials is astonishing.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Berlin, 28th] It is reported that the Soviet occupation authorities are actively expanding the Brunndiss airport near Leipzig, turning it into a major aviation center between the Soviet zone of Germany and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 28th] The Standard Evening News published alarming news, saying that the French, British, and American military authorities are now considering evacuating 500,000 Berlin residents during the winter. According to an external spokesperson, he has no knowledge of this matter.</p>
<h3>Communist Parties in Asia Are Gradually Growing Stronger; Implies That They May Succeed; Seize Every Opportunity and Utilize It</h3>
<p>[United Press Agency, Washington, 28th] "U.S. News &amp; World Report" published on the 28th that the growth of the Communist Party in Asia in the past six months "implies that the Communist Party in Asia is gradually becoming more likely to succeed, not in the next year or the year after, but within five to ten years." This estimate is based on a trip to Asia by the magazine's reporter, Mr. Fromm. Mr. Fromm reported that after conducting on-the-ground inspections of the situations in Japan, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, and India, it shows that the United States and Western countries are failing in the "Cold War" in Asia due to negligence. The main factor in the strengthening of the Communist Party is that the United States and other Western powers cannot formulate a positive policy towards the East. It is still questionable whether the Asian International Communist Intelligence Bureau, which aims to unite these and other Communist Party actions, currently exists. The Soviet Union is now coordinating with national movements, seizing every opportunity to use them, causing Asia's attitude towards the United States to become increasingly disappointed."</p>

<h3>National Bank Door Is Increasingly Crowded; Collecting Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency; Last Day of This Session; Yesterday's Report Recorded Nearly 30 Million Gold Yuan Collected</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Today is the last day for the Central Bank to collect gold, silver, and foreign currency. People going to exchange money have been extremely crowded for days, and yesterday was even worse. (See photo taken by this newspaper.) In order to facilitate the exchange for the people, the Central Bank has specially extended the collection time starting yesterday. The collection time for gold, silver, and silver coins has been extended to 6:00 PM, and the collection of foreign currency has been extended to 8:00 PM.

<h3>Textile and Construction's First Retail Department; Entrusted to Retail Woolen Fabrics; Total Number is 3 Million Yards; Supply is Not Lacking</h3>
<p>Selling Price Per Yard Starts From 2 Yuan and 2 Jiao</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A spokesperson for the Custody Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Enterprise Committee made the following statement to this newspaper's reporter yesterday regarding the committee's entrustment of the China Textile and Construction Company's First Retail Department to supply and sell woolen fabrics: The total number of this batch of woolen fabrics is approximately 3 million yards, most of which come from Australia, and were transferred to the committee for safekeeping after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. During the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration period, this batch of woolen fabrics was not suitable for relief purposes, but it was also inconvenient to sell them in large quantities in the market, fearing that it would affect the market price of domestic woolen fabrics, so they were not processed for a long time. After the transfer to the Post-War Custody Committee, it was recently decided to entrust the Textile and Construction First Retail Department for retail in order to implement the government's order to allocate materials and absorb floating capital, but the committee still reserves the right to stop selling at any time. There are more than 20 types of this batch of woolen fabrics, with various colors available, but women's woolen fabrics account for the majority, and there are also many men's overcoat woolen fabrics.</p>
<p>Six Yards Cut Into One Section</p>
<p>Currently, women's woolen fabrics are supplied first, with prices ranging from 2 yuan and 2 jiao to 2 yuan and 8 jiao per yard. Every six yards are cut into one section, and each person is limited to purchasing one section. Although men's overcoat woolen fabrics have been unpacked, they have not yet been priced, so they are not supplied for the time being. The valuation of the committee is jointly agreed upon by representatives from the city's woolen fabric industry, the Textile and Construction Company, etc., and the valuation is 10% lower than the market price in principle. The proceeds from the sale are collected by the Bank of China as one of the financial sources for the Post-War Custody Committee. He said: Within the daily operating hours of the Textile and Construction Department Store (from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day), this batch of woolen fabrics is supplied without restrictions, and the total number is as high as 3 million yards, so there is no need for citizens to crowd together.</p>
<p>Crowded All Day Long</p>
<p>According to Manager Hu of the Textile and Construction Company's First Department Store, the company's department store usually supplies products from the company's various factories, and it already feels overwhelmed. Since the 14th of this month, the Post-War Custody Committee has entrusted the sale of woolen fabrics, which has resulted in crowding all day long. The department store's sales staff, totaling only 27 people, feel even more difficult to cope with. It has now invited the company's authorities to approve the addition of eight people to alleviate the urgent situation. It is reported that most of this batch of woolen fabrics are cotton-wool blends, and there are no similar products on the market. Currently, the department store sells an average of about 4,000 yards per day, and can collect 12,000 to 15,000 yuan per day, but because the price is relatively low, the number of sales continues to increase daily.</p>

In addition, the acting manager of the Tang's Shanghai branch, Mr. Gui, after being summoned for questioning in a case, the affairs of the Shanghai branch will be handled by the Tang's secretary, Fan Jiping.</p>
<h3>Reselling Allotted Rice Discovered; Zhou Yongsheng Rice Shop Punished</h3>

The People's Mediation Committee has accepted their request, but it has been receiving many confidential reports and tip-offs from citizens every day. The committee has been conducting random inspections every day together with the US Economic Cooperation Administration. Yesterday, it discovered that Zhou Yongsheng Rice Shop at 161 Dapu Road in the Lu District purchased 20 shi of US Siamese rice by fraudulent means, and resold it to China Flywheel Thread Factory at 900 Xietu Road at 20 gold yuan per shi.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Jiang Jingguo convened a discussion meeting last night at 6:00 PM, gathering rice industry representatives Wan Molin, Xu Songren, Yin Fuxiang, and Hu Wenan to discuss unblocking the city's rice supply. The attending representatives forcefully stated the difficulties of the rice industry, saying that Shanghai's limited rice price is lower than that of other ports, so the goods are not smooth. For example, before the limited price, 500 to 600 dan of rice were transported from Zhoupu to Shanghai every day, but now the export is prohibited. The same situation exists in other rice-producing areas. At the time, Wan Molin also provided a written report on the city's rice reserves and other related situations.

<h3>Those Responsible for Industries Such as Yarn and Cloth; Commended for Assisting with Price Limits</h3>
<p>Director Jiang believes that the price of yarn and cloth in this city can often affect other commodity prices.

Yesterday, he specially sent telegrams to Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, Huang Jiufeng, chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Yarn Business Association, to commend them and encourage them to continue to uphold their original intentions in the future to promote this effort.</p>

<h3>Wax Statue Exhibition - A Domestic First - To Be Held at the Shandong Guild Hall Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Lifelike Sculptures of Historical Figures</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Cheng Zhenxia, renowned domestically for her research on Chinese historical clothing and accessories, has recently been invited by the Preparatory Office of the Taishi Art Museum to bring her nearly ten years of work, a total of twenty-two pieces, from Beijing to be displayed and exhibited at the Shandong Guild Hall on Zizhong Road (Ximen Road) starting from the first of next month. A wax statue exhibition of clothing and accessories is a domestic first and is undoubtedly of value in modern cultural relics and art research. These wax statues of clothing and accessories range from the Han Dynasty to the Republic of China, including Han and Wei Dynasty ladies' attire, Tang Dynasty shawls, Tang Dynasty Hu (non-Han Chinese) clothing, Song Dynasty formal women's wear, Yuan Dynasty "Gugu" hats, late Ming Dynasty women's everyday wear, Ming Dynasty scholar-official attire, Ming Dynasty children's clothing, Ming Dynasty old woman's attire, Ming Dynasty maid's attire, Imperial concubine embroidering a tiger, Qing Dynasty civil officials, Qing Dynasty military generals, Empress Dowager Cixi's longevity fairy robes, Qing Dynasty palace maids, Imperial Prince's auspicious robes, Imperial Consort, Mongolian young chieftain, Republic of China sacrificial robes, Wu Xun (a famous educator), and Republic of China women's formal wear, totaling twenty-two pieces, all displayed separately in different rooms. All the wax statues and clothing accessories have been meticulously researched and substantiated from historical records by the author, taking more than a year to complete each perfect model. The wax statues have vivid facial expressions, resembling real people. For example, the room displaying the Imperial concubine embroidering a tiger is further equipped with a wedding backdrop of the imperial palace interior, making people feel as if they are on a historical stage. Among them, Cixi's costumes and the Imperial Prince's auspicious robes were purchased from the Forbidden City, making them particularly valuable. Wax statue making originated in England and France. Cheng studied the production techniques with famous artists during her early years in England. At that time, the Chinese art world lacked a concrete understanding of wax statues. After returning to China, she taught at Yanjing University in Beijing, and devoted herself to studying the historical clothing and accessory system of China, achieving profound accomplishments. The works exhibited this time are the culmination of her decades of comprehensive research.</p>

<h3>Adhere to the Price Limit Policy to the End - Chiang Ching-kuo Vows to Engage in a Long-Term War of Attrition with Profiteers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo informally hosted a dinner for foreign reporters in the city last night, invited by Zhao Junmai, head of the Fisheries Management Office. More than ten representatives of foreign newspapers and news agencies stationed in Shanghai attended. Director Chiang had important official duties to attend to and was represented by Secretary Gao. In answering various questions, Gao emphasized that Chiang Ching-kuo was determined to implement the price limit policy. According to the experience of price limits in Chongqing during the war, hoarders often forced the government to raise the price limits by concealing materials, which ultimately led to the failure of the price limit policy. Today, Chiang has the determination to adhere to the price limit even if merchants do not supply goods to the market. He believes that after a stalemate of two or three months, the price limit policy will eventually be victorious. For example, if Shanghai has no pork supply due to the price limit, citizens can still live, but if it persists for three months, meat merchants may not be able to withstand it. Chiang has this conviction and is determined to carry out a long-term war of attrition against this organized destructive force. In the month since the implementation of economic controls, Shanghai's prices have remained relatively stable, but prices in other parts of the country have soared, which will affect the control work in this city. To this end, Chiang has specifically requested the central government to formulate measures to stabilize prices in other regions. Director Chiang's work is entirely in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan. The rumor that he is acting on his own is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Materials at the North Railway Station - Estimated to Reach Thousands of Tons - Sufficient Evidence Required for Retrieval</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Cheng Yi-kuan, captain of the Economic Inspection Brigade, the materials currently confiscated at the North Railway Station without exit permits are estimated to be around one thousand eight hundred tons. Owners who wish to retrieve them must have sufficient evidence to prove that they are not materials intended to evade regulations.

It is speculated that the owners may have gone to other cities and entrusted transportation companies to transport the goods. When asked about the inspection of private warehouses in the city, Cheng said: There are about two thousand private warehouses in the city. In principle, there is nothing wrong with warehouses storing goods, but it is also necessary to consider their type, quantity, and date to determine whether there are any illegal activities.</p>

<h3>Second Surprise Inspection at the North Railway Station - Thirty-Five Gold Bars Discovered in Opened Suitcase - Female Teacher En Route to Hangzhou Intercepted</h3>
<p>Temporarily Held in Custody by the Railway Bureau, to be Accompanied to the National Bank for Exchange Today</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Police Department of the Railway Bureau launched its second surprise inspection yesterday afternoon, targeting passengers on the Jinling and Qiantang express trains. Under the supervision of Li Ruhe, stationmaster of the inspection station, inspectors boarded the trains in batches, stationed at the ticket entrance, and conducted inspections of passengers on the two trains one by one. At about 2:15 PM, a young woman dressed in a bright red cheongsam and a light yellow short绒 coat, carrying only a small travel suitcase, a radio, and a bunch of bananas, entered the platform with a first-class ticket for the Qiantang express train. Inspectors waiting nearby stepped forward and explained that they were ordered to conduct an inspection. The woman was very calm and accepted the inspection. Railway police, noting that her suitcase was too heavy, requested to open it. The woman immediately produced the key. Upon opening the suitcase, it was shockingly filled with large gold bars, packed in bundles of five, wrapped in kraft paper, totaling thirty-five bars, amounting to three hundred and fifty taels. Inspectors, noting the excessive amount, asked the woman to go to the police department for questioning. According to her statement, her name is Zhou Jian, from Xinyang, Henan, 23 years old, a graduate of the Foreign Languages Department of Beijing Normal University, and formerly the director of education at the elementary school affiliated with the Second Supply Division of the Beijing Air Force. She was recently hired as an English teacher at Zhejiang Provincial Medical College. The gold bars belonged to Zhang Zhicheng, a relative of her sister, Zhou Qihua. Her sister's husband is Wu Qiujian, the current Administrative Inspector of Yuyao. The day before yesterday, she was entrusted by her sister to come to Shanghai from Hangzhou to retrieve the gold bars from safe deposit box No. 6842 at the Bank of China, intending to take them back to Hangzhou to exchange for gold yuan to purchase a house at No. 29 West Main Street in Hangzhou. The owner of the gold, Zhang Zhicheng, is currently residing at the Qingtai Second Hotel in Hangzhou. She does not know Zhang personally, so she does not know other details. The woman stated everything calmly and without reluctance. The Police Department of the Railway Bureau telephoned the Economic Supervision Office for instructions. After being instructed to send the case file to the office for review, the woman insisted on retrieving the gold bars, arguing with them until about 8:00 PM, when she finally agreed to temporarily seal the gold bars in the suitcase, to be temporarily held in custody by the Police Department of the Railway Bureau, and a receipt was issued. This morning, the Police Department dispatched personnel to protect and accompany her to the Central Bank to exchange the gold for gold yuan. The woman left the police department at 8:30 AM to stay at a friend's house, preparing to go to Hangzhou again today.</p>

<h3>Collusion Between Chinese and Japanese Merchants in Smuggling - Court Rules Not Guilty - At the Time of the Defendants' Actions - No Explicit Legal Provision to Punish Tax Evasion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yoshii Mutsumi, the representative of the Japanese Nakaizumi Sangyo Co. in China, and Sheng Yu, a Chinese merchant, were accused of colluding with each other to evade customs duties. The court pronounced yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM: Yoshii Mutsumi and Sheng Yu were both not guilty. The reasoning for the verdict: the defendants colluded with each other between March and April of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, raising 120 million yuan and using the name of Zhongmei Industrial Company to transport seafood, fish, needles, etc. from Japan on the Japanese ship "Nissei Maru", concealing them from Chinese customs, smuggling them to Shanghai, and selling them for profit, which constituted a continuous crime of violating Articles 3 and 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Implementing Customs Duty Evasion. It was found that the regulations were extended in September of the thirty-first year of the Republic for a period of one year, and were not extended thereafter, and have long since expired. The current smuggling regulations were promulgated and implemented on March 11 of this year, which was after the defendants' actions. At the time of the defendants' actions, there were no explicit legal provisions to punish customs duty evasion. Apart from administrative penalties imposed by customs in accordance with the anti-smuggling regulations, it is difficult to impose criminal penalties, and therefore a judgment of not guilty is made. In addition, the court passed the following resolutions: (1) Disputes over wages in the printing industry; (2) Disputes over the conversion of wages for bamboo ware fence groups into gold yuan; (3) Disputes over wage discounts in the dyeing and cleaning industry; (4) Issues related to public holidays for union officials, recommending that the central government formulate separate measures; (5) Outline of the work plan for the survey of the status of joint industry employees in this city, etc.</p>

<h3>Obstructing the Execution of Demolishing Shanties - Prosecution of Rickshaw Pullers and Four Others</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Dai Weiyan, Zhang Xiaosizi, and Li Dejiang, three rickshaw pullers, previously built shanties illegally on a site at the entrance of Lane 554, Tonghua Road. Xi Miaokun and Fuming Machinery Factory jointly reported them on August 31. After investigation by the Jiangning Road Police Precinct, they were given a police warning and ordered to demolish the shanties themselves within three days. However, Dai et al. did not comply. On September 5, Lou Guifang, a staff member of the precinct, led two police officers to order the demolition. Accidentally, the roof collapsed, injuring a child named Chen Changhua. At this point, Dai et al. took the opportunity to incite more than a hundred shanty dwellers nearby to surround Lou et al. At this time, Dai Bin, who claimed to be a member of a construction brigade, grabbed Lou's uniform and said: "You should be taken to the troops for handling if you are demolishing private houses without permission." Subsequently, someone telephoned the precinct to send police officers, who arrested the four people together and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Recently, the investigation was concluded, and the four defendants were prosecuted for obstructing official duties.</p>
<h3>Robber Couldn't Bear to Harm Uncle - Called the Police to Lead the Arrest of Accomplices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Five robbers, Wang Mingting, Jin Quande, Shen Simiao, Xu Manfu, and Ying A San, had previously committed numerous crimes in Ningbo and were unable to gain a foothold. They came to Shanghai one after another last month, staying at the home of Ying A San's uncle at No. 431 Jiangxi Road. Wang Mingcong then moved to his uncle Zhang Yongnian's place at No. 4, Lane 457, Xinzha Road. Jin et al. learned that the Zhang family was wealthy, and once planned to rob them on the 27th, scheduling to go to Zhang Yongnian's home on the night of the 28th to commit robbery. They even called Wang Mingcong to participate and guide them. At this point, Wang was in a dilemma and had to promise them, but when they arrived, he took the opportunity to escape and reported to a volunteer police officer, who reported to the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Department. The Municipal Police Department sent additional police officers, led by Wang Mingting, to No. 431 Jiangxi Road, where they captured all four suspects, Jin Quande, etc., and took them to the bureau for interrogation. After verifying the facts, they were transferred to the District Procuratorate for trial.</p>

<h3>A Small Interlude After the Battle of Rehe - The Release and Pursuit of Prisoners in Chengde City</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Xing Ruofeng</p>
<p>[Aeronautical Report from Chengde, 22nd] A case of releasing and pursuing prisoners recently occurred in Chengde. In today's bandit suppression campaign, under martial law, such "temporary measures" are prescribed by law. It should not be considered a strange incident. However, the play "Releasing Prisoners," performed by Emperor Taizong of Tang 1500 years ago, is now being replayed on the stage of the atomic age. Although the times are different and the chaos is completely different, the comical play of the Tang Dynasty has, after thousands of years, once again occurred without a parallel.</p>
<p>When the war in western Rehe broke out on May 11 of this year, martial law was declared by the Pacification Zone Headquarters on the 13th. At that time, the situation of Chengde's all-out war was extremely tenacious with the military and civilians sharing the same hatred. On one hand, a centralized command was used to unify the attack and defense, and on the other hand, a non-combatant population evacuation policy was adopted to reduce food consumption within the city. The Rehe High Court and the Local Court were both preparing to move to Beiping, and of course the prisoners in jail were to be included in the evacuation.</p>
<p>Chengde Prison at that time held various types of prisoners, including 179 convicted prisoners and 154 prisoners awaiting trial, totaling 233 prisoners. Of the cases, prisoners who manufactured and smoked drugs accounted for two-thirds of the total number, while the remainder were bandits, robbers, thieves, swindlers, murderers, and corrupt officials, with varying numbers of each type of prisoner.</p>
<p>On May 28, Prison Warden Yang Zheng, in accordance with the "Temporary Handling Measures for Prisoners in Various Prisons and Detention Centers in the Buffer Zone," sought and obtained the approval of Commander Shi Jue and immediately began to implement the evacuation. The method of evacuation was to transfer 16 convicted felons (including bandits, robbers, and murderers) to Beiping for imprisonment, and to release 209 prisoners on bail. The 18 prisoners who could not obtain bail were transported by the military in trucks to Shuangtashan, and each was rewarded with two liters of rice and expelled from the territory. In this way, the evacuation was successfully completed by June 3, and the staff of the two high courts also flew to Beiping safely. Thus, the expelled prisoners were both pardoned and rewarded, and in the midst of gratitude and surprise, they were happy to slip away. The prisoners released on bail thought that "posting bail" was a procedure to deal with the official arena, and they were fortunate to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get out of prison, feeling relaxed. However, Chengde was expensive to live in, and many of them had no intention of staying, so they went to other places to make a living. As Ouyang Xiu said in the past: "To release them intending that they will surely come, is the feeling of the superior deceiving the inferior. To expect that they will be acquitted and return again, is the heart of the inferior deceiving the superior." Regarding these two speculations, it seems that no one at that time had the leisure to think about them, and it was only natural that these parolees did not think about coming back later.</p>
<p>In mid-June, after the successful conclusion of the Chengde defense battle, the market gradually returned to normal. However, most of the staff of the two high courts were still in Beiping due to traffic conditions. It was not until the end of August that a small number were able to return one after another. Then, the issue of "pursuing prisoners" was brought up again. On September 1, the warden of Chengde Prison issued a notice stating that: all prisoners who were released on bail "in accordance with the provisions of the 'Temporary Handling Measures for Prisoners in Various Prisons and Detention Centers in the Buffer Zone', were released on bail or released and set free in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the aforementioned measures 'when order is restored, a notice shall be issued, setting a time limit for reporting; if they fail to report after the deadline, they shall be pursued for bail or wanted'. Now, this city has announced the lifting of martial law and restored normalcy. This notice is hereby issued, requiring all prisoners to comply and report to this prison or nearby police station within five days after the issuance of the notice. If they fail to report after the deadline, they will be pursued for bail or wanted in accordance with the law. Do not wait and delay." Now, it is already late September, and the deadline specified in the notice has obviously exceeded the limit and been "delayed."</p>
<p>To this end, the reporter made a special visit to Chengde Prison. Jiang Fajun, the head of the general affairs section of the prison, was holding a meeting to discuss prison affairs. According to Jiang, since the "pursuing prisoners" notice was posted, as of September 15, only two prisoners had returned to prison to report: one was a drug addict, Yang Zhimin, 23 years old, who had been sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, with the term expiring on November 1. The other was a thief, Ren Yunheng, 43 years old, who had been sentenced to four months of imprisonment, but the term had already exceeded the sentence after deducting the bail period. In addition, a large number of prisoners had already left Chengde City and were actively being pursued for bail. According to Prosecutor Zhang of the District Court, "Prisoners who fail to report after the deadline should be guilty of escape under the law, but Chengde's environment is different, traffic is blocked, and news transmission is obviously slow. Although the prisoners' return date has been exceeded, it can still be handled leniently as appropriate. If they deliberately evade, which hinders the closing of the case, the judicial authorities will maintain the dignity of the law and immediately take strict measures to pursue the bail and issue arrest warrants."</p>
<p>So, how many of these prisoners can be recovered in the end? The answer is obviously uncertain, but according to general observation, most prisoners "have already gone to other places to make a living," which is a fact. Among these people, most belong to minor crimes. In fact, each prisoner is given 25 taels of official rice per day, plus a food allowance. This may be better than what they eat at home. The main reason for their failure to return to the case does not seem to be entirely to avoid punishment. However, if they go and never return, continuing to "delay" indefinitely, then it will be difficult to avoid strict pursuit of the guarantor and the issuance of arrest warrants. As for the ancient feat of the three hundred prisoners who, after being released, "eventually returned without a single one missing," it can only be left to others to excel.</p>
<h3>Looking at Danyang with New Eyes: Initial Success in Dredging and Reclaiming Lian Lake</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Li Tianxing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin, 25th] Danyang, on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, is undeniably a barren little county with a population of just over 400,000. Its customs and folklore are neither like those of Jiangnan nor like those of Subei, and its dialects are particularly complex. Not only are they different from those of Suzhou and Changzhou, or Zhenjiang and Nanjing, but even within Danyang itself, the speech of the city and the countryside differs. The speech of the four city gates in the east, west, south, and north also varies. Danyang speech is not only difficult to understand, but especially difficult to speak. It is not difficult for someone from another county to learn a sentence or two in the dialects of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, or Shanghai, but it is quite difficult to learn a sentence or two of Danyang dialect. Politics, economy, and culture are all relatively backward. Moreover, in the early days of the War of Resistance, the enemy's frantic bombing and artillery fire destroyed more than 80% of the entire city of Danyang. A scene of broken walls and ruins made the ancient city of Yunyang Qu'a even more desolate.</p>
<p>However, along with victory came a new birth for Danyang. Mr. Shu Yunzhang became Danyang's savior. Shu is a native of Danyang who left his hometown for Tianjin in the north at the age of ten or so. After decades of hard work, he achieved success and status. Now in his sixties, mindful of his roots and loving his hometown, he planned the construction of his hometown early on. Starting in the year of victory, he first built a tall chimney near the station outside the North Gate, establishing the Danyang Yarn Factory with a total capital of 50 billion. The factory buildings are completely new. Currently, 10,000 spindles are spinning day and night, producing more than 700 pieces of yarn per month, mostly 20-count fine yarn. The brand is "Danyang Phoenix Facing the Sun," which sells well in the Changzhou and Shanghai areas. The machinery is all from the United States, dating back to 1941, and is considered a new type in China, saving labor. Another 10,000 spindles of machinery have arrived and are being installed. According to Manager Wang of the factory, it can be completed within the year, and all 20,000 spindles can be put into operation. The power was initially supplied by the Qixia Weir Power Plant, but now a Siemens generator has been installed for self-generation, which is currently sufficient for operation. This is the first sound of Danyang's emerging industry. Mr. Shu's original plan was for the yarn factory to have 30,000 spindles, another weaving factory with 1,000 looms, a flour mill, and a machine factory. With Mr. Shu's courage, it should be no problem to realize these plans step by step.</p>
<p>Mr. Shu's second major project is the dredging and reclamation of Lian Lake. Lian Lake is located outside the west gate of Danyang, bordering the city. It is also known as Lian Pond or the Rear Lake of Qu'a. It was the site where Xi Jian of the Jin Dynasty supervised the training of naval forces, hence the name "Lian" (training). It covers an area of more than 15,000 mu, formerly connected to the Grand Canal in the east and receiving runoff from the highlands of the Maoshan Mountains in the southwest. Its circumference is more than 40 li, and its vast expanse of water serves as a reservoir for the irrigation of 50,000 mu of farmland around the lake. Over the years, sand and silt have accumulated, and the lake bottom has become silted up. It has turned into a sea change. Proposals to dredge and reclaim it have been made for years, but limited financial resources have prevented them from being realized. It has always been a scene of wild water and lush grass, becoming a regret for Danyang. When Shu Yunjun returned, he raised his voice and commanded as he wished, and things finally began to take shape. A dredging and reclamation organization was first established, a committee specifically responsible for the matter. The dredging and reclamation goals and guidelines are half dredging the lake to ensure the water conservancy of 50,000 mu of farmland around the lake, and half reclaiming the southeastern half of the lake for farming. Open up fields, build new villages, plant flowers and trees on the long embankment, and raise fish and grow lotus in the lake. Use scientific methods to seek production, arrange scenery, and build a new type of Lian Lake with villas, yachts, and a new attitude, to prosper the entire Danyang. Therefore, the vision is very beautiful, not only not an illusion, but also practical.</p>
<p>For the first phase of dredging funds, Mr. Shu donated 13 billion. The Danyang County Government used 1,000 shi of grain, the Danyang Yarn Factory bore 1,200 shi of grain, and the Forest Department subsidized 1 billion. Work began repeatedly this spring and has achieved initial success to date. First:</p>
<p>Two small pumping stations have been fully completed, located in the east of Lian Lake, near the north gate of Danyang. The construction is entirely new, cast in reinforced concrete. One is responsible for inflow, and the other for outflow. This is to regulate the water conservancy of Lian Lake and maintain a certain high and low water level. The Grand Canal is used for intake and discharge, so there is no fear of flooding. Another organization has been set up to be specifically responsible for this. Second:</p>
<p>Two agricultural reclamation areas have also been established. The first agricultural reclamation area covers 600 mu and is located at the southeast end of Lian Lake, adjacent to the city. Reclamation work began in early summer, with an agricultural reclamation committee specifically responsible for it. Dikes have been built all around, with deep ditches. The land is flat as far as the eye can see, and more than 500 mu have been planted with japonica rice. A green expanse, vast as the sea, with drooping rice ears, strong and upright, inspires excitement. A bumper autumn harvest is expected this year. The person in charge told reporters: Each mu can yield at least 600 to 700 jin of grain, with labor and material costs of about one shi of rice per mu. Production does not fall short, and the surplus gives people even greater excitement. The tone of the person in charge also feels energetic! The second reclamation area is currently being actively developed, and the embankment has been completed. More than 4,400 mu will be a large area, laid out in front, waiting to be released. According to Director Zou of agricultural reclamation, wheat will definitely be sown this autumn. The seeds have been borrowed from the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute, more than 17,000 jin, but it is still not enough. People across the country who care about rural revitalization and agricultural innovation have also come to Danyang to inspect. On the 19th of this month, Fang Mao of the Forest Department, Zhang Zhiwen of the Jinling University Agricultural College, agricultural experts Zou Bingwen and Runzhi, and others gathered at Lian Lake to conduct on-the-spot inspections and provide detailed plans. The goal is to actively develop and create a new miracle on Lian Lake. In the evening breeze, with the sun setting, at a time when the rice flowers are fragrant and the sunset is red, a group of forty or fifty farmers, carrying hoes on their shoulders, barefoot, very strong and comfortable, finish their work and return to the agricultural reclamation office to rest. This scene truly reflects the greatness of the work and the greatness of the construction. In addition to the agricultural reclamation water station, there is also an organization specifically responsible for breeding, which mainly uses the water area for fish, chicken, and duck farming. Some of the fish fry ponds are full. Some of the grown fish have been released into the ditches for breeding. Lian Lake fish are plentiful in the Danyang market, and in the future, there will certainly be no end to fish, shrimp, and crabs. Chicken and duck farming is certainly a part of the business, but it is still waiting for planning and practical implementation.</p>
<p>This new development has inspired the people of Danyang and made every visiting tourist look at Danyang with new eyes. As a passing reporter, after a tour, I cannot help but be very excited. Therefore, I quickly write this report to inform the people of the country, hoping that provinces, counties, and cities across ancient China will be inspired and prioritize construction and new beginnings, learning from Danyang!</p>
<h3>Traitorous Bandit Zhu Liping Captured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dangtu, 26th] Zhu Liping, who once served as the deputy captain of the puppet security brigade in this county and a traitorous bandit, secretly came to the county a few days ago and was captured by the Lianfang District Office of Daqiao Township in a teahouse in the town.

<h3>New Jiangnan Silkworm Seeds Yield More Than 60,000 Shi of Cocoons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zongjiang, 28th] Farmers in Jiangnan raised autumn silkworms this year. Under the guidance of the Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Committee, new varieties were used, and the yield has increased. According to the test results, each sheet of silkworm eggs yields about 20 jin of cocoons, more than double that of the old varieties. The committee issued a total of 300,000 sheets of new varieties. This autumn, the fresh cocoons in various counties totaled more than 60,000 shi. The provincial government stipulates a purchase price of 80 gold yuan per shi.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Chemical Fertilizer Plant: US to Loan $6 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu, 25th] The famous chemist Hou Debang, general manager of Yongli Chemical Company, came to Sichuan for Yongli's Sichuan business and to assist in Sichuan's construction. Recently, upon his return to Nanjing after finishing his official business, he told reporters: (1) The United States has agreed to loan $6 million for the purchase of machinery for the Sichuan Chemical Fertilizer Plant, but the agreement will only be formally signed and payments made after domestic funds have been raised and the Central Bank has issued a certificate. The Nongmin Bank will undertake $3 million of the $4.5 million that needs to be raised domestically, which is no problem. However, the $1.5 million that Sichuan Province needs to raise itself must wait until after consultations with the Sichuan Construction Department before formal preparations can be made. (2) The deep well exploration work currently being carried out at the Yongli Sichuan Plant in Wutongqiao is yielding good quality black brine. It has already been explored to a depth of 1,000 feet, and new machinery has been purchased from the United States to carry out the next step of work. Yongli is determined to develop underground resources, determine and develop raw materials such as salt brine, oil, and gas, to strengthen assistance to Sichuan's industry.</p>
<h3>Zhanjiang Devastated by Hurricane</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper Kaifeng, 25th] The Kaifeng County Council recently cabled the Ministry of Food, requesting the prompt allocation of payment for 5,000 large packages of military grain purchased on behalf of the government from July to September, in order to alleviate the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>A True Picture of the Flood in Qinghai</h3>
<p>In late August of this year, Qinghai experienced successive heavy rains, and mountain floods occurred frequently. The disaster-stricken areas covered all counties in the province. The severity of the situation has not been seen in nearly a century. This newspaper has reported on the details of the disaster in several special dispatches and features. The Qinghai Provincial Government has mobilized manpower from all over the province to actively carry out rescue efforts, and transportation has gradually resumed. However, the province's vitality has been greatly damaged. All the projects that need to be restored due to the flood, as well as rural relief and the resettlement of disaster victims, require a large amount of financial resources. The province's financial resources are insufficient, and it is hoped that people in the country will show sympathy and lend a hand. The central government, understanding the plight of more than one million people in Qinghai and the needs of national defense construction, has promptly allocated emergency relief funds. The disaster victims in the province are fortunate to receive relief, and border national defense has been restored early. Pictured here is the situation near Xining.</p>

<h3>Disputes Arise Due to Incorrect Accounting After Currency Reform</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu, 25th Dispatch] Recently, a major dispute occurred here due to an error in a voucher after the currency reform. The only Qiming Electric Light Company in the city had a depositor named Kang Jian who deposited 150 gold yuan. However, a staff member of the company mistakenly wrote 1.5 million gold yuan on the voucher and deposit slip. When the accounts were reconciled in the evening, the error was discovered. The depositor then sent a letter stating that he had deposited 150,000 gold yuan. Although the company tried to explain, the depositor insisted on the figure of 150,000 yuan and prepared to ask the court for a ruling. The dispute has now escalated, and the person in charge of the company has resigned to take responsibility. The chairman, Xiang Chuanyi, is trying to mediate. This error was caused by the deeply ingrained impression of the number of legal tender currency and serves as a warning to staff members of general companies and firms.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Instructions on Early Repayment of Legal Tender Bonds: Bonds That Matured Before August 19th Will Still Be Repaid According to the Original Method and Cannot Apply for Doubling</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Central Bank's Department has approved the Ministry of Finance's announcement that the measures for handling government legal tender bonds have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Early repayment will be handled according to the regulations, starting on October 1, 37th year of the Republic of China, and should be implemented as scheduled. In order to provide a basis for bondholders and managing banks to apply for handling, the Ministry of Finance has formulated the following instructions for handling early repayment of government legal tender bonds. After receiving the Ministry of Finance's telegram and the instructions for handling early repayment, the Central Bank's Treasury Bureau has notified its branches to investigate and handle accordingly. The instructions are divided as follows:</p>
<p>1.  In accordance with the regulations of the measures for handling government legal tender bonds, the Ministry of Finance has designated the Central Bank and its entrusted banks to manage the early repayment of government legal tender bonds. The Bank of China has been entrusted to handle matters abroad.</p>
<p>2.  The government bonds for early repayment stipulated in the above measures are limited to the principal and interest coupons that were actually sold and issued over the years and had not yet matured on August 19, 37th year of the Republic of China. For those that had already matured before that date, bondholders should extract them themselves and exchange them for gold yuan at the managing bank according to the original repayment method. They should not be mixed into the immature principal and interest coupons and apply for double repayment.</p>
<p>3.  Legal tender bonds allocated by the government as collateral for bank loans without actual sale will be handled separately by the Ministry of Finance and are not included in the above-mentioned early repayment. However, if legal tender bonds held by bondholders are used as collateral for private loans, they will still be repaid early.</p>
<p>4.  The standard for calculating the doubling of various bonds for the above-mentioned early repayment shall be in accordance with the attached table of the measures for handling government legal tender bonds, and income tax shall be deducted from the interest.</p>
<p>5.  When applying for early repayment, the original holder should first obtain an application form from the managing bank, fill in the name, type, number of bonds, amount, number of attached interest coupons, and the amount of gold yuan to be exchanged in detail, affix a seal, and affix the same seal on the upper corner of the bond before submitting it to the managing bank for exchange.</p>
<p>6.  After receiving the application form and bonds submitted by the bondholder, the managing bank should verify the secret marks on each bond to see if they match the sample, and whether the numbers have matured before August 19, 37th year of the Republic of China, or have been reported lost and invalidated, and payment has been stopped. They should also check whether the number of interest coupons submitted is missing, etc. If no errors are found after checking, the payment will be made immediately. If payment cannot be made immediately, a receipt may be issued first, and the payment date may be scheduled.</p>
<p>7.  The principal and interest coupons that have been verified to be correct and approved for payment should be punched and invalidated by the managing bank. As usual, the managing bank's head office should submit them to the Ministry of Finance for verification and cancellation.</p>
<p>8.  The most recent coupon of each bond, which matures after August 20, 37th year of the Republic of China, should be submitted together with the principal coupon for repayment. If any are missing, the interest for that period will not be repaid. However, the three types of bonds: 25th year Reconstruction Bonds, 26th year National Salvation Bonds, and the first installment of 29th year Military Needs Bonds, all have the most recent two coupons that mature after August 20, 37th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>If the bondholder only submits the most recent coupon (or two coupons) mentioned above without submitting the principal coupon, repayment should be approved. However, if the gold yuan calculated after doubling these interest coupons is less than one cent, it should be calculated and repaid by rounding to the nearest cent.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned most recent coupon (or two coupons), if any of the subsequent coupons are missing, the bondholder should publish a statement in the newspaper declaring them invalid before applying for repayment.</p>
<p>9.  For the various legal tender bonds repaid early, the income tax on the interest shall be deducted at the prescribed rate based on the total amount obtained by doubling the interest received by the bondholder. If the income tax is less than one gold yuan, it shall be calculated by rounding to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>10. If the managing bank encounters special circumstances when handling the early repayment of legal tender bonds, it should immediately report it to the Ministry of Finance for verification and handling.</p>
<p>11. The period for early repayment is set from October 1, 37th year of the Republic of China to March 31, 38th year of the Republic of China. If bondholders have not applied for repayment by the deadline, all bonds will be invalidated?</p>
<p>12. These instructions should be posted and announced by the managing banks in various locations to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Scarce Arrivals and Smooth Sales: Rice Supply Falls Short of Demand, Coarse Grains Strong and Expensive, Oil Market Approaching Price Limits</h3>
<p>Rice transactions are increasingly sluggish. Arrivals are scarce, with only 294 *shi* registered in the northern part of the city and 1,472 *shi* in the southern part. Therefore, the supply remains limited. Not only is *japonica* rice rare, but even *indica* rice is scarce. Some high-quality rice has prices but no transactions. Only milled *indica* and *ducheng* rice have some sales. Samples are quickly sold out, leaving no supply to meet demand in the future market.</p>
<p>Flour sales remain stagnant. Unless factories start selling, the stalemate in transactions will be difficult to break. Moreover, rationed flour continues as usual, with allocations every three days without interruption.</p>
<p>Coarse grains are strong and expensive, with few transactions. Soybean supplies are limited, making procurement difficult in the local market. Corn arrivals are already rare, with only two to three hundred bags sold. Red sorghum remains at ten yuan. Buckwheat trading is active due to demand from out-of-town merchants. Pea prices hold steady. Broad bean transactions are minimal. Sesame prices have risen by five *jiao* due to sluggish sales. Raw peanuts have not opened yet.</p>
<p>Edible oil is gradually rising. Crude oil remains stable because it is already close to the price limit. Pure crude oil is still 59.90 yuan. Soybean oil factories are releasing more supply, with prices generally around fifty yuan, an increase of eight *jiao*. Vegetable oil is forty-seven yuan, up one yuan, approaching the price limit. Cooked vegetable oil rises again by one yuan and five *jiao*. Small cart sesame oil is transacted at the limit price. Soybean cake supply is scarce, with Datong brand opening at two hundred pieces.</p>
<h3>Banking and Financial Industries Agree to Further Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The three associations of banking, money lending, and trust industries, in accordance with the authorities' explicit orders, will further reduce deposit and loan interest rates from the first of next month. The agreed-upon rates are 1.60 yuan per thousand for daily loans, five *jiao* for daily deposits, and one yuan for the loan industry’s daily loans. The three associations made this decision at a meeting yesterday, and all members will be notified to implement it accordingly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Readjusts Margin for Check Clearing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It has been learned from the Central Bank that after the currency reform, the amount of margin paid by all banks and firms for check clearing should be adjusted. It has now been stipulated that, except for Shanghai, where the exchange should be determined by the clearing house, every bank and firm in the cities of Tianjin, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Chongqing, Guiyang, Xi'an, Kunming, and Chengdu will pay 10,000 gold yuan. Wuxi, Wuxian, Tiejiang, Wujin, Changshu, Xuzhou, Jiangdu, Hangzhou, Zhengxian, Shaoxing, Yongkang, Yuyao, Bengbu, Wuhu, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhongshan, Nanhai, Xinhui, Wan'an, Taishan, Shantou, Guilin, Cangwu, Changsha, Quyang, Wuchang, Shashi, Yichang, Neijiang, Yibin, Wanxian, Pixian, Leshan, Zigong, Guiyang, Jinan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Bian'e, Taipei, Taichung, Changhua, Keelung, and Kaohsiung will each pay 5,000 gold yuan. All other cities and counties will pay 3,000 gold yuan. The bank has also issued a circular to its branches and offices for compliance.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Cotton Yarn Transactions, Few Cloth Tokens, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw considerable hesitation among industry participants due to rumors of price limit adjustments. Sellers became reluctant to sell, and both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Trading in the market trended toward scarcity again. However, outbound transportation remained blocked, and out-of-town buyers rarely made purchases. Local sales were sluggish due to the ban on transportation, and inventories were low. Nevertheless, sporadic sales continued.</p>
<p>The market supply of 42-count fine yarn was limited to the Golden Chicken and Red Man Clock brands. 40-count Jincheng and other brands were all secretly asking for ten yuan extra. 32-count rose by 3.5 yuan. 21-count Double Horse remained at the limit price of 783 yuan. Except for the 20-count Cai Kuixing coarse yarn, which was discounted, the rest were transacted at the limit.</p>
<p>16-count popular yarn was rarely traded. Miscellaneous brands had some transactions. 10-count Boy Scout and other brands saw sales of 286 pieces by the Shenxin Yarn Factory, with 10-count yarn being more abundant, causing sellers to rush to sell, which weakened the market. The Fangjian Company continued to offer 20-count Nine Lions, with the price still at 700 yuan. Only 301 bales were sold.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw sparse transactions as today was the last day for registering inventory. Those shops with registered goods mostly took a wait-and-see attitude as procedures were being completed. With the market in other areas turning sluggish and local money supply easing, and with rumors of cotton yarn and cloth being transported to the south based on the actual needs of Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan, sentiment improved, tokens were scarce, and the market surged.</p>
<p>12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially showed a slight increase of two *jiao*. The supply was insufficient after the opening, and out-of-town buyers and local shops searched eagerly, causing the price to rise again to 27.8 yuan. The afternoon close was at 27.6 yuan, a jump of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day. B-brand Longtou also rose by nine *jiao*. Wufu and mid-range Laba Baby and other fine cloths, as well as Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji and Zhigong, also rose from three *jiao* to over one yuan. Many also reached the price limit. Due to demand exceeding supply, the total volume of transactions was two-thirds lower, only 1,180 bolts.</p>
<h3>Rayon Allocation Price Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau held another rayon meeting yesterday, deciding that the price of rayon from September 27th to October 2nd would remain the same as last week. Italian rayon will still be sold at 1,033.3 yuan per case. Furthermore, the bureau recently shipped forty cases of rayon to Tianjin for allocation to factories there.</p>
<p>Additionally: The rayon market is sluggish because the industry lacks a continuous supply. Most holders are taking a wait-and-see approach. Few sellers exist under the price limits, making the market quiet.</p>
<p>Continuous Supply Requested</p>
<p>The Rayon Commercial Association, in order to support the national policy of currency reform, has been handing over all inventory before August 19th to the association for allocation and sale at the price limit on a daily basis. For over a month, due to the lack of continuous supply, inventory has been decreasing while demand is increasing. Therefore, a request for supply adjustment has been made to the Materials Adjustment Committee.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Stop Falling and Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market stopped falling and turned upward. Due to continuous declines in recent days, sentiment turned bullish, stimulating buying. Holders took the opportunity to raise prices, causing the market to become firm. Except for the 20th-period Taiwan red and Hainan red warehouse receipts, which slightly fell by two to three *jiao*, the rest all showed increases.</p>
<h3>Directorate of Import Control Announces Annex (II) Goods, Import Quotas for the Seventh and Eighth Quarters, Totaling US$42,141,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters of Annex (II) goods under the Import and Export Trade Regulations have been submitted by the Directorate of Import Control to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Except for battle-damaged cars and jeeps, as well as motor vehicles and long-distance buses, for which the government does not provide foreign exchange, which will be determined after further investigation. Gasoline, diesel, kerosene, lubricating oil, and lubricating grease have had their import quotas reduced due to American aid supply. The total amount of foreign exchange supplied by the government is US$42,141,000, a decrease of more than 40% compared to the fifth and sixth quarters. However, while the total amount has decreased, the quotas for most goods remain the same as in the fifth and sixth quarters to maintain supply. The table of import quotas for Annex (II) goods for the seventh and eighth quarters, as announced by the Directorate of Import Control, is copied below:</p>

<h3>Operating Expenses for Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Temporarily Revised Based on Pre-War Amounts, Aims for Practical Implementation and Gradual Increase</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Operating expenses for secondary and higher education institutions previously had established standards that were followed. Since the War of Resistance, currency fluctuations have led to repeated adjustments by the Ministry of Education, but these have failed to keep pace with the price index, resulting in lower standards and a proliferation of poorly funded schools. With the currency reform, all financial regulations must be revised. The Ministry of Education believes that restoring pre-war standards is necessary to consolidate the foundation of schools and enrich their content. However, given the current socio-economic conditions, there are still many difficulties. To balance reality, the expenses are temporarily revised based on the pre-war amounts, converted to gold yuan, which is only half of the original standard. This aims for practical implementation. When socio-economic conditions improve in the future, the expenses will be gradually increased to reach the original pre-war standards. The Ministry of Education has issued Instruction No. 52746 to all to follow. After the promulgation of these standards, the original table of minimum operating and annual recurring expenses for private secondary and higher education institutions is abolished. All schools should immediately follow the new standards. Existing schools with insufficient funding should increase their funding within a specified period and report for verification. Newly established schools must first raise sufficient funding before being allowed to be established.</p>
<h3>33 Private Schools Shut Down for Unauthorized Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Education has repeatedly emphasized that the establishment of private schools must meet the required conditions and obtain prior approval.

<h3>Dagong Victorious Against Jingwei in Suzhou, Plays United Team Today and Returns to Shanghai After the Game</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Dispatch on the 29th] The Shanghai Dagong basketball team was recently invited by the local military and police joint sports association to compete in Suzhou. Today at 3:30 PM, they first faced the Jingwei team composed of teachers and students from the Suzhou National Defense Ministry Survey School. As a result, the Dagong team lived up to its reputation, easily defeating the Jingwei team by a score of 60-38. It is scheduled to play the Suzhou United team again tomorrow at 3:30 PM. Suzhou fans were informed and came to watch, which was quite crowded.</p>
<p>[Guoguang News Agency, Suzhou, Dispatch on the 29th] The Shanghai Dagong basketball team, at the invitation of the local military and police sports association, arrived in Suzhou by train at 10:15 AM this morning in the rain. The military and police sports association immediately held a banquet to welcome them. After a short rest, the guest team played against the Jingwei team at the Guangji Bridge stadium at 4:00 PM. The rain stopped, the sky cleared, and the audience came in droves, no less than 3,000 people, making it the first grand occasion in Suzhou. At 3:00 PM, there was another exhibition match between the Beifeng team and the Meiqi team. In the first half, the Meiqi team led by 19-14. In the end, the two teams tied with 30 points each. At 4:00 PM, the main force took the stage, with the visiting team fielding Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Huang Bailing, Wang Cunzhong, and Hua Yunshan. The home team fielded Han Xizhuo, Liao Dihang, Wang Yijun, Chang Shigao, and Wang Pengfu. Hua Yunshan scored the opening point with a free throw, and Jingwei's Liao Dihang immediately retaliated, leading by 4-1 and 10-7. Dagong was not willing to fall behind. Huang Bailing and Tu Wenlong showed their skills, and the score skyrocketed. In the first half, they took the lead by 26-10. After the break, Dagong changed players, with Cai Wenhua, Li Shiqiao, Wu Kangkai, You Longtan, and Zhan Chen taking the field. Jingwei also brought on Yi Kefei. After the exchange, Dagong was even more active, once leading by 37-12. At 54-28, guest team Xu Zhongyi replaced Zhan Chen. Jingwei took the opportunity to counterattack, but unfortunately lost too many points. Time ran out, and Dagong won 60-38. Tomorrow (30th), the second game will be at 4:00 PM at the same place against the Suzhou United team.

<h3>Shanghai Police Department's Response to the Complaint of Fire Victims on Xinmin Road, Zhabei</h3>
<p>Zhun Kui and Da Er, fire victims of Xinmin Road, complained that the Zhabei Nanxing Road Private Fire Brigade (i.e., the First Section Fire Brigade of Northern Shanghai) handled the situation poorly, resulting in severe damage, requesting investigation of responsibilities. Upon investigation, the brigade's response seemed slightly delayed when arriving at the scene of the fire. Instructions have been given to rectify this and intensify training. As for the brigade collecting 50,000 yuan in temporary fees to add ten pairs of firefighting dragon heads, they were already installed in October of last year and supported by bills from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The claim that only one or two pairs were installed is not true. In addition to instructing them to report and publicize their income and expenditure according to regulations, we are responding for your review! Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Police Department. September 20th.</p>

<h3>Using a Bicycle as Collateral to Buy a Watch: An Uninvited Guest Never Returned</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I run a watch repair shop at Xiaodongmen. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, a man in short clothes suddenly came to buy a watch. After obtaining the watch, he claimed that he needed to show it to a friend before making a decision and offered to leave his bicycle (license plate number 11233) as collateral. However, he never returned, and a week has passed. I suspect that the bicycle may have an original owner and that he may have stolen it as part of a scam.

If the owner of the bicycle can come to Sun Shengji Watch Shop at the entrance of Xinda Xiang Silk Shop on Xiaodongmen Street within five days to verify the situation, they may reclaim the bicycle.

<h3>Travel Impressions of Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Ji Mo</p>
<p>Recently, I have rarely read travelogues. Perhaps it is because non-professional writers cannot find time to travel amid their busy schedules, while professional writers, given the high cost, find it more cost-effective to spend money on reference materials to find topics for writing. Therefore, even if we occasionally read articles in newspapers about the specialties of a certain place, they mostly focus on collecting anecdotes and elaborating on some insights, which seem far from the realm of "allowing readers to take a virtual tour."</p>
<p>Although I have long intended to travel, it was not until recently, when I accompanied a friend to Hangzhou for business, that I fulfilled my long-held wish.</p>
<p>We departed on a gloomy morning, taking the 7:05 am train. The scenery of the fields along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is similar to that of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. However, the houses dotted among the rice paddies have upward-curving eaves, which are different from what we usually see in Suzhou. The stations along the way, such as Chang'an and Xiashi, seem less affluent than those in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway.</p>
<p>At 11:45 am that day, a little less than five hours after departure, we arrived in Hangzhou. After passing through the tunnel and exiting the station, I looked back at the railway station building, which was built with stones engraved with various patterns, resembling a palace or a temple, quite magnificent.</p>
<p>Outside the station is a wide, asphalt road with a constant stream of vehicles. We wanted to go to Yue Wang's Tomb. Rickshaw pullers asked for prices ranging from six jiao to one yuan. Later, we inquired from passers-by and instead took a No. 1 bus near the station, which cost only 200,000 yuan per person in legal tender. After arriving at the lakeside, we transferred to a Yonghua Company bus, which took us directly to Yuefen Street, costing only 350,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>During the journey and on the bus, I noticed that Hangzhou women dressed very plainly. Only two or three out of ten had permed hair. They also wore unfashionable "basketball shoes" for their sturdiness and durability. After returning to Shanghai, I even heard a colleague from Hangzhou say that undershirts and tank tops were still selling well locally, while sweaters were not in demand. This shows the frugality of Hangzhou's atmosphere.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, after arriving at Yue Wang's Tomb, we went to Yue Wang Temple to pay our respects. In my humble opinion, Yue Wang Temple must have been an added building. Initially, there was only the burial ground, and then the temple was built, and the ancestral hall to worship Yue Fei's parents was added. Therefore, we determined that Yue Wang's Tomb was very simple in structure and not even as grand as the mausoleum of a wealthy family. There is a pair each of stone figures, stone horses, and stone sheep in front of the tomb. At the entrance, there are four kneeling stone statues of Qin Hui and his wife, separated by fences.</p>
<p>Yue Wang's Tomb and Yue Yun's Tomb are both semicircular, with cement poured on the outside. I went around to the back of the tomb and noticed that there was a gap in the cement, revealing the black bricks inside. There is a couplet inscribed by Feng Yuxiang, who recently passed away, on the stone pillar in front of Yue Wang's Tomb.</p>
<p>Another feature of Yue Temple is the abundance of plaques and couplets, which almost fill the main gate and corners of the building. Most of those who have signed their names are figures from the warlord era, such as Zhang Zongchang and He Fenglin. Their intention is nothing more than to attach themselves to Yue Temple, hoping to achieve immortality. But their words and deeds have long been forgotten by the world.</p>
<p>After leaving Yue Temple, I hired a rickshaw again to pull along the West Lake to the flagpole, at a fare of 3.5 jiao per vehicle. The weather was intermittently sunny and rainy, so I was unable to get out of the car and appreciate the beautiful scenery of West Lake. In my humble opinion, the beauty of West Lake lies in its vastness, which is boundless. Second, it is tranquil, with calm water and a sense of being detached from the world. Third, it is a victory in setting off the scenery, with distant mountains stacked on top of each other, with varying shades of color, no less than a masterpiece of landscape painting.</p>
<p>After the rickshaw pulled us to the flagpole, although we had eaten some refreshments on the train, we felt hungry, so we went into a × Wei Guan, a restaurant with a grand facade.</p>
<p>The restaurant had already passed lunchtime, and there were few customers. We ordered half a catty of wine and two simple dishes. We also asked the waiter if there were any seasonal dishes. He said there was a stir-fried blue crab, priced at three yuan per plate. We thought the price was too high and did not order it. My friend also ordered clams and ham. The waiter replied that it was sold out. So we slowly ate the dishes we had ordered.</p>
<p>During this time, we were "bamboozled." Because after we returned to Shanghai, we found that the bill listed clams and ham, which had not been served. Considering the few customers in the restaurant at the time, the possibility of deliberate error was greater than that of negligent listing. I hope that readers who visit the restaurant in Hangzhou will pay attention and not repeat my mistakes.</p>
<p>After the meal, we strolled through the city of Hangzhou. The areas of Guankou, Sanyuanfang, and Qinghefang are lined with shops. All major banks are located here. Police officers at street corners use whistles to direct traffic, which is different from those who use traffic lights.</p>
<p>Due to my worldly affairs, I returned to Shanghai with my friend on the night train at 7 p.m. Fortunately, transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou is convenient, and there are acquaintances in Hangzhou who can provide meals and accommodation. I will have to carefully savor the famous scenic spots on my second trip to Hangzhou in the future. Moreover, a Hangzhou native told us that it would take fifteen days just to explore the inside and outside of West Lake and that it would not be possible to thoroughly tour it in a few days.</p>
<h3>Thinking of Others</h3>
<p>— Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>Always thinking of others is a virtue in dealing with the world, and it is also the key to gaining more meaning and interest in life. A and B are two people with very different temperaments, but they are acquaintances who can often meet each other. Once, I went to C's house and saw A there. He was also there to see Mr. C. Later, B also came, and B also wanted to find Mr. C to talk about something. Mr. C walked away, leaving A and B sitting in the study, not saying a word, not even looking at each other. It was really awkward, yet also laughable, to see two acquaintances acting like enemies. I almost laughed out loud.</p>
<p>But Mr. C has one good point: he understands all kinds of people. He likes stubborn and dull people as much as he likes happy and frivolous people. He often thinks of others, carefully observing their temperaments, as if he were trying on clothes of different styles. Between two people with different personalities, you can find that there must be one person who holds many prejudices, thinking, "B is always a child." "B will never amount to anything. He is so childish and superficial." B, on the other hand, must be thinking, "He is so arrogant. He is always looking down on me." Because of this, it is difficult to have a meaningful conversation, so much so that even though they are in the same room, they do not speak to each other, as if there is some old grudge. I don't understand: why do they take minor differences so seriously?</p>
<p>Carefully examining each person's personality is a very interesting thing. Not only looking at others, but also taking some time to look at yourself is equally rewarding. Why are stingy people like that? Why are vicious and selfish people like that? Impatient people, mean and calculating people, hypocritical people, they are all interesting. Once, an impatient and vulgar person lost his temper with me, but I was laughing at his angry expression. Although I didn't laugh out loud, I didn't listen to his meaningless scolding. Although I suffered a loss, I still thought of those who took advantage of others—I often do that. Perhaps it is a sign of weakness, but this choice is natural for me because I think it suits me better.</p>
<p>Some people say that so-and-so has a very strange temper. Because he is usually aloof and withdrawn, he suddenly loses his temper and scolds people. Some people say that the old lady is very annoying because she is extremely stingy and constantly scolds the servants and nephews. Perhaps by getting closer to them, understanding their characters and inner suffering, and always thinking of them, we will find that they are not strange or annoying. People's personalities and behaviors are layered, as a certain Western writer said: "Everyone is like a book," perhaps that is what he meant.</p>
<h3>Price Controls and Thrift</h3>
<p>— Qian Dacheng</p>
<p>Since the advocacy of the thrift movement, the response from all parties has been extremely good, and special telegrams expressing support are often seen in the newspapers. However, what is the actual situation?</p>
<p>In my hometown teahouse, I saw a group of tea drinkers. When ordering refreshments, steamed buns were clearly price-controlled at 50,000 yuan each, and sesame cakes at 70,000 yuan each; but there were many people who strained their throats and asked people to custom-make steamed buns for 100,000 yuan or 150,000 yuan each, and sesame cakes for 150,000 yuan or 200,000 yuan each, showing off their wealth, as if they were afraid that the refreshments were being sold too cheaply, simply encouraging price increases. With such social customs, what is the use of government price controls? It is difficult to change this trend for a while. The government advocates thrift, but what is the use of officials simply setting some thrift regulations and posting some slogans if they cannot lead by example? Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the senior officials here issued an order prohibiting subordinates from giving gifts. But I saw many civil servants wearing Zhongshan suits and badges carrying gifts on the street, hurrying to and fro, but I never heard of superiors returning the gifts from their subordinates, even though they had already violated the order of the senior officials. Perhaps they believe that "benevolent rule is inseparable from human feelings," although there is a solemn order, the subordinates' small expression of filial piety cannot be ignored, right? Alas, human feelings! Great are human feelings! If we only talk about human feelings, what else can we talk about price controls? What else can we talk about thrift? The wealthy are unwilling to be thrifty, and the common people are already suffering unspeakably, so there is no talk of thrift. If the wealthy people themselves are willing to be thrifty, and those above lead by example, fostering a good atmosphere of frugality as a virtue, then there will be no need to set any regulations, nor to post slogans, nor to control prices. Naturally, no one will buy things that are too expensive. However, it is impossible to achieve this good atmosphere in one fell swoop. Failing that, if the government's price controls and advocacy of thrift are ineffective for a while, it is better to exert various pressures or sanctions on those influential people. At the same time, those in power should lead by example and no longer give people a reason to criticize. Perhaps there is a way. But thrift is ultimately a temporary solution; the fundamental solution is to work hard to increase production. After treating both the symptoms and the root cause, the term "price control" can disappear invisibly. The above is just a scholar's view. I'm afraid someone next to me is laughing and calling it "sour grapes"?</p>
<h3>Why Not Try It</h3>
<p>— Wanli</p>
<p>(1) Write down your house number.</p>
<p>(2) Multiply by 2.</p>
<p>(3) Add 5.</p>
<p>(4) Multiply by 50.</p>
<p>(5) Add your age.</p>
<p>(6) Add 365.</p>
<p>(7) Subtract 615.</p>
<p>You will get a strange number. The first part of the number is your house number, and the second part is your age.</p>
<h3>Yu Dafu's Birth Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Congzhou</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Lu Danlin in this journal's "Yu Dafu's Will," according to the will prepared on the first day of the Yi You year, said that in the 34th year of the Republic of China (Yi You), Mr. Yu was 54 years old, then by calculation, he would be 57 years old this year. According to what I know, this year may be wrong. I will tentatively base this on Mr. Yu's "Zhi Mo in Memory" which mourns Xu Zhimo, which says: "New poems are spread throughout the universe, but you unexpectedly returned with the wind. Classmates of the same age, old friends like you have already rested. The Huabiao is entrusted with your spirit, when will you transform into a crane and return? In life and death, I deeply regret that I have a wife to write a requiem." He himself said that he was a classmate of Zhimo in the same class in the Hangzhou government in the second year of Xuantong (1910). Zhimo was born in the year of Bing Shen in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896). If Mr. Yu was of the same age, he should have been born in 1896. By this calculation, he would be 53 years old this year, which would not be as far away as Mr. Lu's article says. I am afraid that some people think that the will he wrote himself must be correct, but there may be errors in transcription. If the will is really 54, then the will may be problematic. There is no one who is unwilling to truthfully write their age on their will. In the past, Zhu Guwei was unwilling to say his real age, but he notified Kuang Youhan before his death, which is one example. I wrote this to report to Mr. Lu, hoping he will agree.</p>
<h3>On the Beijing-Shanghai Train</h3>
<p>— Yao Hechu</p>
<p>Rice paddies are green and yellow before the White Dew, distant peaks and trees compete in beauty, best suited to passing by the waterside, the eighth month of the Dian Lake's water connects to the sky. Pagoda trees are dense and bamboo is graceful, cattle sheds and pavilions are quiet and convenient, long days rushing and shaking the carts, the people in the house sleep with brick pillows.</p>
<h3>Returning Home from Duty to See Family Planting Vegetables</h3>
<p>Evening wind should be clear and brisk, a slight chill is felt in the season, saying I will return soon, all causes are joyful, diligently working in the garden, I feel ashamed for my leisure, the frost and dew make the soil fat, I murmur awaiting the end of autumn.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Wang Yitang finally met his fate before the Mid-Autumn Festival this year after procrastinating for three years. During these three years, his every word and deed in the court and in the prison cell was a source of comedic material, recorded in detail by various newspapers, truly a compendium of jokes. Especially before his execution, when asked if he had anything to say, he shouted loudly asking to "appeal" and begging the president to "show mercy." Anyone with a little common sense would know that this was impossible and unreasonable. Never before has a condemned prisoner asked for "mercy" before execution. Not only could it not delay or prevent his death, but it added to the great joke, and we felt that his foolishness was beyond reach. (In the Qing Dynasty, condemned prisoners could "cry injustice before execution." To value human life, they were given a final opportunity to appeal and possibly be sent back for retrial. But there was no so-called "begging for mercy before execution," so it was not a question of favor.) For a person who came from a prestigious background and studied abroad to be so lazy is enough to represent an unbelievable transformation and decline of a portion of young people. Thinking of the general situation, I do not have time to lament for Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>Wang's original name was "Zhiyang." He was the top student in Hefei County's imperial examinations and was awarded the title of Xiucai. He studied hard since he was young, and at the age of 26, he became a Juren in the Jiangnan list (Chen Kangzu led the list) in the Gui Mao year. In the following year's provincial exams, he was quickly promoted to a high position (Tan Yanlan's list). He was then made a Jinshi through the imperial examinations and appointed as a chief. His early success was smooth. In the old days, countless people suffered for a lifetime without achieving success, and people like Wang were admired by many scholars. Moreover, after obtaining his title and official position, he actually aspired to study abroad and learn about the army, which was an outstanding performance. Because at that time, old literati were suspicious or afraid of Western learning, and they often said "we do not conspire with each other." Even if a small number of people resolutely understood the new, they could not imagine turning from writing to martial arts, putting down the pen and picking up the spear. Among thousands of scholars, there were only two people who became Jinshi, went abroad, and learned martial arts. One was Wang, and the other was Ling Guangxi (also a Jinshi of the Jia Chen year, in the same list). After Ling went to London and returned, he followed his father, Ling Zhongqi, the governor of Shanxi. During the Xinhai Revolution, father and son died together.) Those who became famous for their writing and calligraphy and then took up arms were rare. People praised them as role models for scholars, and the future of the country depended on such outstanding and unique young people. This is what the public opinion at the end of the Qing Dynasty admired.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the Republic of China, Wang immediately joined Yuan's camp, putting all his new and old learning behind him, and monopolized the "Unification Party," collected party fees, and bought party members to exclude dissidents. There was a rumor that he had "both hands grasping President Yuan and kicking Liang Shiyi away with one foot." When the old Duan was in power, he also monopolized the "Anfu Club," using the euphemism "buying fish" to send telegrams, representing "buying congressmen," hence the nickname "old boss of the fish market." The 30 years of the Republic of China's activities are described in Woqiu's "Biographies of Contemporary Celebrities," which is enough to determine his life, and I cannot bear to repeat it now.</p>
