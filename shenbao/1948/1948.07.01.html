<p>末有人提出監院各項法規，如收受人民書狀辦法草案，審查規則等條例，應即先行起草，再提會討論。當即由各單位推一人組委員會審查。</p>

<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立法院僑務委員會卅日上午舉行第四次會議，央行總栽俞鴻鈞，財次徐柏園均應邀蒞會，報吿僑匯及僑資等問題，徐柏園報吿政府爲協助華僑復員，政府舉辦華僑復員貸款，已貸出一百六十萬美元，華僑投資祖國，財政部正計劃中。徐氏報吿僑匯情形稱：戰前每年僑匯多至一萬萬美元，少時亦五千萬美元，戰後法幣貶値，三十五年僑匯僅三千二百餘萬美元，三十六年僅二千零十餘萬美元，現則每月不及五十萬美元，政府決設法鼓勵僑資回國。繼由俞鴻鈞報吿僑匯减少原因及擬採用之新辦法，據俞氏稱：僑匯减少原因有三：（一）外匯牌價與黑市相差過遠。（二）僑匯機關分支機關不够，效能不高，不合僑民心理。（三）交通梗阻，郵電不便。今後如何把握僑匯，應注意匯率問題，現已另擬改善僑匯新辦法，正呈當局核定之，一俟核准，即可施行。俞·徐等報吿畢，吳尙鷹，伍智梅，陳汝舟等相繼提出質詢，對於孫關沒收僑民回國時所帶之黃金，多表不滿，並提出若干建議，均經俞·徐等分別答復。</p>

<h3>勃里奇致函馬歇爾　責拖延軍事援華　動用軍援款方法美已通知我方</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕參議院撥款委會主席勃里奇，廿九日致函國務卿馬歇爾，指斥美政府「違反美國人民之深切關懷」而拖延軍事援華事宜。該函略稱：「由於中國政府返需軍事供應與經濟援助，及美國人民對保持中國獨立之深切關懷，美國會曾於一九四八年四月三日授機並命令建設銀公司預先支付五千萬美元之援華款項。自四月三日迄目前爲止，美政府未曾動用該款之任何部份，爲中國政府購買軍事物資之需。在動用援華計劃之預支款項方面，美政府殊有拖延之情。建設銀公司預墊援歐計劃之款項，雖已於四月間可動用，而根據同一法案之軍事援華基金，則直至六月中旬方開始發出，且自該款之運用規定以後，從未有用於援華方面者。余希望閣下對參院撥款委員會詳盡解釋國務院對此緊急事件爲何行動遲緩。本委員會並希望獲得保證，在履行國會於去年四月訂定公法四七二號所表示之願望方面，應採取迅速行動。</p>
<p>〔又電〕勃里奇斥責國務院違反國會之願望，而拖延軍事援華一節，國務院廿九日立即加以駁覆。據國務院稱：衆議院法案與援華法案問之歧見，最近方爲兩院聯席委員會所解決，援外法案甫於廿八日由杜魯門總統簽字，中國政府現能動用之一億二千五百萬美元軍事援華款項之方法，已於廿九日送交中國大使館。</p>
<h3>監委鄒魯等提請政府　早日促成對日和約　案由重要決提下次院會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕監委鄒魯等九十四人提出「請政府早促成對日和約」一案，於監院卅日晨第十四次會議中討論，首由鄒魯就該案內容予以說明，其主要點在請政府能自動自主促成對日和約，則無論對國際和平，對當前若千反美扶日之潮浪，均將轉佳。鄒氏說明達廿分鐘。繼有陳志明等發言，一致認爲案由重要，應再作研究後提下次會中討論。</p>
<p>提案全文</p>
<p>鄒委員魯等九十四人所提：「請政府早促成人對日和約案」全文如次：</p>
<p>我人於三十一年，鑒於戰禍之烈，對於戰事結束，應爲世界人類永久幸福計，不可再種報復循環之因；故提出戰後國際問題之解決，應反前「凡爾賽和約」之覆轍，除主張根絕軸心國之侵略能力外，其原則如下：（一）消滅戰勝戰敗觀念；（二）不應有地域之歧視；（三）不應有民族之歧視；（四）經濟問題，應有平等合理調劑之解決。抗戰結束之後，國策復作很明顯之表示，對於首先侵略我國並爲世界大戰禍首之日本，我元有亦表示寬大之懷，故對於日本國家及其人民，決不欲其生存有所妨碍，所以對於日本之扶持，並不反對，而近來國中對於美國扶日，有所反對，甚而至於澳洲·菲律濱亦有此種反對，實爲東亞國際上極不幸之事件。雖美國對於改進糧須賀佐世保及吳港等海軍根據地，海上保安廳之股立及交與潛水艇驅逐艦與日本，擴充在九洲本洲及北海道諸島之飛機塲，保留其飛機製造廠，增加日警人數及其配備，訓練日本飛行人員，並允其報效，增加鋼鐵造船及紡織之生產量諸問題，有所解釋，而結果終不見諒於人，尤其是主張極度减低日本之賠款，甚至有唱低至一億多美元者，而停戰業已三年，日本重要戰犯，亦未見宣判，尤其是使我國很難諒解。在我國歷史方面言，美國向爲最親密之朋友，而此次抗戰，不特對於世界出力甚大，戰前戰後，中國得美國精神上物質上援助尤不少，我人及世界各國，應無反美之理，而生出目前此種現狀，由於對日條約未能締結，美國不能不本其盟國所授之托，行其職權，而行使職權所達之眞象，各國不明，尤其是利害切身之中國亦不明，所以生出社會上一種惶惑之現狀爲今之計，亟宜締結對日和約，如能締結，則締約國家可依約行使職權，不致美國單獨執行負各方責難，同時有條約可依，如有偏袒之處，各締約國亦可依約共同糾正，不致憑憑早方之判斷，而與執行者以責備，此不特於締約國有利而於目前單獨負責之美國尤有利，即就日本論之，和約一結，即化敵爲友，不致於今日戰事結束巳前後四年，日本猶處於敵人之地位，雖戰時之賠款不能不付，然亦有一定之預算以進行其生產分配方法，一方擔負戰事應負責任之賠款，一方面可以充買其國民之生計。至於戰犯之判斷，則日本應無所愛惜，是不特爲禍世界，爲禍中國，而實爲禍日本，否則日本在今日固翹然頭等國家人民享受康樂之福利，是以對日條約之締結，不特於東亞國際有利，尤其對於美國對於日本有利。蓋自有史以來從無戰事停止三年尙未締結和　　約者，此應亟須由首被侵略之中國力促其早日實現也。</p>
<p>人以爲對德和約尙未締結，對日和約當無法進行，實則日本爲侵略之首，和約應首由對日締結始，况對德閒題複雜，對日情形單純，何况對意奧匈和約巳成立於前，對日和約更無不能簽訂之理由。</p>
<p>因此，我國爲自身及維護對美邦交計，爲日本國家安定計，關於對日和約問題，應即採取主動，一方面力謀善策，打開過去僵局，另一面積極從事不可或缺之準備工作，根據歷次會議所決定之原則，擬訂草約。如是，不但可闡明我國對日和約問題之立塲，亦足以解除「反美扶日」運動已經引起之誤會，而中國在東亞之地位亦可確立，此事政府向依盟國之態度爲進退，未能採取主動政策，應予糾正。是否有當？敬請公決。</p>

<h3>社論　從柏林危機說到狄托之變</h3>
<p>正當在蘇聯切斷英美法三區的水電供應及鐵路交通引起柏林嚴重危機的時候，歐洲共產國際情報局突然決議開除南斯拉夫狄托元帥的黨籍，並號召南國人民反抗其政府更換其領袖，不僅使東歐集團發生一大裂痕，而且也引起了蘇南兩國關係的惡化。在南國共黨首腦，認為蘇聯威脅南國獨立的程度遠在資本主義國家之上，而蘇聯則以為南國共黨首腦狄托輩採取違背馬列主義的錯誤政策，對蘇聯共黨及其領袖一再誹謗，極盡其反蘇的能事。因雙方的互訐，乃發生這次的「狄托之變」，也就將東西兩集團間的「冷戰」的重心由柏林移至貝爾格萊特了。</p>
<p>歐洲自納粹德國屈膝投降之後，戰爭狀態雖早吿終了，而迄今三載，對德和會尙未召開，和約更談不到，這眞是現代史上空前未有的怪現象。而且所謂對德問題，也早已變了質，在表面上雖然仍稱為德國問題，但按之實際，却變為東西兩集團在歐洲的明爭暗鬥。緣在歐洲戰事結束之初，英，美，法，蘇四强對於如何收拾戰後的殘局，怎樣對付戰敗的德國，態度原都一致，大家都願意依照波茨坦協定的規定，締造歐洲的和平，大家也都主張解除德國的武裝，肅淸納粹的侵略思想，責成德國賠償聯合國各國在戰時所受的損失，務使戰敗的德國能成為眞正愛好和平的民主國家，永遠不會再成為歐洲和平的威脅。殊不料三年以來，列强在歷次國際會議之中，尤其是美蘇兩國，因為思想的不同，利書的衝突，不論對於德國問題或歐洲其他問題，都站在兩個極端，互相水火，自從去年在莫斯科舉行的末次外長會議不歡而散之後，德國問題旣陷於僵局，其他歐洲問題更無從談起，於是歐洲僵局不但未見鬆動，而且東西兩集團分道揚鑣，愈去愈遠。</p>
<p>以美蘇的對德政策而言，可謂已發生根本變化。過去雙方無不以防　　國再起侵略為目標，但今日却變為雙方無不欲利用德國作　抵制對方的工具了。例如蘇聯在東德佔領區內，無往而不欲博得德國人民的歡心，籍以煽動德人的反美情緒，並企圖在柏林成立一個「德國人民政府」，號召德國人民的團結與統一，將英美法三國的勢力逐出柏林的門外。此在西方列强方面，也放棄了從前嚴格管制德國的政策，想改採扶助德國復興的政策，欲將德國造成抵制共產勢力侵入西歐的堡壘；故在美國領導之下，先有英美佔領區的合併，後有西德協定的締結，最近西德又實行幣制改革，無一不足以視為扶德反蘇政策的表現。所以三年以來，東西雙方在德國的明爭暗鬥，從來沒有停止過，雖不流血淌汗，但也是一種無形無聲的決鬥，一般政論家均稱之為「冷戰」。我們回憶幾番冷戰的結果，雖然東西雙方各有勝敗，但終究把德國分裂為東西兩個德國了。蘇聯在西德協定成立後，就對柏林採取「冷圍」的戰略，切斷英美法三區的水電供應及鐵路交通，造成柏林的危機，企圖將英美的勢力遂出柏林門外，以抵消西德協定所造成的影響。美國務院發言人曾公然指斥蘇聯對柏林的「冷圍」，是一種「片面的挑戰行為」，德境美軍總司令克萊將軍也說：「蘇聯現正實施其最後的壓力，企岡將我們逐出柏林，但無論如何，除非訴諸戰爭，蘇聯採取任何行動，都是不會成功的。」</p>
<p>由此可知，柏林危機的惡化，實足以構成歐洲和平的嚴重威脅，決非悲觀論者的杞憂。英美法三國當局對於此事，莫不萬分重視，傳將向莫斯科採取聯合行動，對蘇聯政府提出抗議，一方面要求蘇聯立即無條件解除其對柏林的「冷圍」，並將柏林危機從當地軍事當局手中，移交由高級外交官員處理，另一方面則警吿蘇聯，如堅持其目前在柏林所採取的策略，則必造成嚴重的後果。這個聯合抗議果眞向莫斯科提出，則勢必造成蘇聯與英美法在德國境內的「攤牌」。英美與論界一致要求政府當局强硬對付蘇聯，聯合國秘書長賴伊也在考慮：「要求安全理事會討論柏林的危機」。看趨勢，如果蘇聯一意孤行到底，勞必引起歐洲嚴重的危機。</p>
<p>但是聯合社忽於廿九日自柏林來電稱，蘇聯對於德境東西交通已局部解禁，柏林的危機頓趨緩和，使屏息以待柏林局勢繼續發展的世人，似乎都可獲得一個喘息的機會。可是別種消息却接踵而來，這就是「狄托之變」，使世人的視綫也隨着東西冷戰重心的移動，由柏林移至貝爾格萊特了。「狄托之變」的爆發，及其將來的結局，目前雖不能言之過早，但無論如何，可與今年二三月間的「捷克政變」，視為東西冷戰中的兩個回合。捷克政變若可謂為東方的勝利，則這次狄托之變。當可日為東歐集團破裂的開始了。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫本是蘇聯在東歐集團中最堅强的一環，但是發生「狄托之變」以後，南國竟變為蘇聯在東歐集團中的一個灑洞了。而且南共也巳有嚴正的表示，除了駁斥共產國際情報局對狄托元帥的指責而外，並呼籲黨內的團結，一致擁護狄托元帥，此一事件雖不能謂西方的勝利，但巳給世人一個寳貴的啓示，就是共產國際的思想，終究與國家民族的觀念不能同時並存的，即使因為一時的錯覺，誤入歧途，但終泯滅不了民族國家意識的存在。南共及其首腦均有此自覺，就是一個絕好的證明。要之，狄托之變，可謂鐵幕以內的紛擾，也可謂東歐集團破裂的開始，在東西冷戰日趨激烈的今日，其意義自然格外深刻，但是未來的發展，能否扭轉今日歐洲的形勢，還要看美國外交如何運用以為斷了。</p>
<h3>普及國民敎育計劃　明年度開始實施　朱教長在立院委會中報告施政</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立法院敎育·文化委員會，卅日午後開會，邀請敎長朱家驊列席，就敎育施政提出報吿。朱氏首承認自抗戰至戡亂，敎育方面受莫大損失，敎育措施距期望甚遠。旋就下述三點提出說明：（一）均衡發展，朱氏指出，各級敎育須均衡配合，大學中各學科，亦應顧到均衡，中學則求中學，師範，職校之均衡發展，不能畸輕崎重，學校之分布，亦注意於內地及邊疆。（二）積極推進基本敎育，自民國廿一年迄今，若干省市巳做到每保一校，去年敎部依憲法令全國普遍辦理六年制小學，並擬自明年起開始實施普及國民敎育計劃，希望在十年內完成基敎之普及。此外，並致力於成人補習敎育，並加强基本敎育之研究。（三）特殊問題的處理，時局動盪，社會失常，學校中如有違反立國精神，毒素之傳播乃至如共黨策動危害國家民族之行動，必預為制止。匪區逃出之靑年學生盡力安置，畢業學生則盡力輔導其就業。朱氏結語稱：敎育為常態工作，設施有繼續性，各方呼籲振救敎育，此亦為吾人所祈求。目前敎育係質量並重，今後對培養師資，充實設備，修訂課程，使學校敎育與國家社會實際需要相配合，此為吾人之職責，自當加緊努力，尤盼各方合作。</p>
<h3>敎部對學潮</h3>
<p>不擬諉卸行政上責任</p>
<p>報吿畢，陳際唐，李鈺等十餘人紛起質詢，就敎育經費，學潮責任及公私學校敎育之設施與發展諸事，相繼提出問題，最後由朱氏作答，略謂：甲，敎育經費已在國家總預算普通部門依憲法佔全額百分之十五，乙，學潮原因雖有政治因素，受職業學生搗亂，但敎部不擬諉卸行政上責任，今後仍將繼續愼選各校負責人，並健全組織。丙，私校成立後，重獎勵監督，今後仍加强督飭其改進師資設備。丁，學校之分布，將不使再集中都市，國民學校務求普遍發展。戊，敎育法令現正整理中。關於失業問題，將一漸自敎育上設法預防。己，對北平師院復大運動，渠頗同情，亦盼該校能恢復過去榮耀。然目前格於大學法之規定，無能為力，敎部除於設備上儘量扶助該校外，並將於修訂法規時，予以合理補救。渠謂：去冬並未允該校可於一年內復大，即有類似說法，一年之期，現並未滿，該院學生實不應以學潮脅迫。此外，朱氏並據河大校長姚從吾報吿，汴坦戰役中，該校學生被流彈擊斃者實僅四人，絕不似一般傳說之嚴重。</p>

<h3>日本局勢和泛太平洋政策</h3>
<p>— 吳嘉棠</p>
<p>美國在遠東的地位和她的長期政策，如果從日本這個焦點出發來觀察，可以看出一個淸楚明顯的輪廓，我在東京和一些最高級的人員談話之後，更加强我的印像：就是無論在外交上和軍略上，太平洋區域實在是一個不可分割的整體。遠東的整個形勢，並不完全依賴提高日本生產水準有效的阻遏共產主義，或是中國的局勢如何能很快的穩定；或是美國能把分散的太平洋各島，建設成固若金湯的防棧；據作者個人的管見，太平洋區域冷戰的勝利，只有在一個條件下方能實現，就是中國，日本，朝鮮，和其他的戰略地區，能够在一個協調的政策之下，相互關聯，行動一致，每個組成份子運用其自身經濟政治和軍略的分量，以謀全體的利益。</p>
<p>這個遠東戰略的分析，好像是老生常談，但是作者得聲明：在赴日作實地調査之前，這種泛太平洋政策的迫切需要，感覺遠不如今日之深刻。以日本而論，目前固由盟德扶植其經濟，使不致為共產主義所乘，可是如果有一日中國被吸入共產主義的軌道，而這種可能性決非僅為想像的，日本將立即成為無可防守的前哨陣地，亦決非美國的金錢和戒備所能予以挽回的。以朝鮮的地位而論，美軍終有一天會撤退，而這個日子一到，朝鮮不是全部落入共產黨的掌握，就是成為兩種衝突意識的戰埸。在這種形勢之下，外界對日本的壓力勢必增加，三島又將成為危險的前進基地，除非另有穩定强大和友好的大陸國家，作側面的掩護和支援，日本亦不易久守。因此，，分析整個遠東的戰略局勢，不難看出中國居於關鍵的地位，目前我國局面混亂，也許有人不願意承認這一點，但事實確屬於此。所以盱衡遠東形勢後，簡單的一句結論是；當中國被共產勢力吞噬之時，整個的遠東將為莫斯科的私人產業。</p>
<p>我深感如果美國不能將遠東的整個局勢和各區域的潛在力量提綱絜領，確定一個總的行動方向的話，改善日本經濟，將是件花錢而不易收效的工作。除非能有一個穏定的中國作為遠東的安定力量，日本終有一天淪為赤化。</p>
<p>在日本調査實際情勢後，深感雖有盟總的兢兢努力，日本人的思想正在很快的左傾，雖然她的政治動向是向右走。日本知識份子中下份子和羣衆的左傾，第一個主要理由是物理學上的反作用，多少年來，日本人的思想是束縛在右派的小圈子裏，在軍閥戰敗之後方才獲得一個解放，現在大家都想探求一下左傾的政治理論，一陣爭取自由的激情，把他們推近了共產主義的邊緣。第二個左傾的原因，是日本人民對目前似乎絕望的經濟情勢的反應。日本的中下層階級，在過去日本强盛時代，生活已是不好，現在更是接近飢餓綫。絕望的貧困本是一種疾病，它驅使人去趨向同樣致命的共產主義。第三個理由是日本今日尙有人希望日本能東山再起，認為在蘇聯統制之下，可有較大的自由。因此，在日本像在中國一樣，「飯碗共產黨徒」人數正在激增。這一類日本人的想法，亦把日本人的一般思潮推到極端左傾。可是在中國赤色政權建立之前，共產主義在日本長期勝利的機會很小。而另一方面看，站在國際反共的立塲上，除非能壓制共產黨在中國的聲勢，在日本和全部太平洋區域的反共努力亦不能成功。</p>
<p>這種分析，引起我的一個看法：就是美國的遠東政策，目前在日本已有一個縮影，遲早會走到對華對日的平行路綫上去。目前這個發展尙欠明顯，且有因政治理由而故意加以掩蔽的，但是這個政策的最後形成是無法避免的。目前的問題，不是這種發展是否可能，而是什麽時候這個政策可以朋朗化，而成為一個有力的決定，以一連串勇敢而設計完善的行動，加以實現。談到一個「泛太平洋聯合」和政治經濟國防外交上的彼此合作計劃，似尚屬言之過早，我在東京時聽到這個計劃，但是當我請麥帥對此發表意見時，他拒作任何評</p>
<p>我覺得泛太平洋聯合也許不會採取任何形式，但是日子一天一天的過去，有若干行動及佈置會逐漸見之實行。日本現局和美國的政策都指向這條路，而除非能採取這樣的措施，美國在日本的全盤計劃亦得不到收穫。</p>

<h3>共產國際情報局指控各節　南共逐項予以駁覆　呼籲黨員團結支持現政府</h3>
<p>〔合衆社貝爾格勒廿九日電〕南斯拉夫總理狄托之共產黨，廿九日在意義上，拒絕共產國際情報局反對南收權之指斥，並直接向莫斯科呼籲辯護其政策。在南國發表此項拒絕聲明後不久，有人目覩狄托自其遭暑別墅返抵首都。據在機塲之目擊者稱，當狄托元帥自機中走出時，面未呈焦憂之狀，諒必狄托元帥個人負有此一局勢之責。此外該委會向南共直接呼籲支持狄托及其政權，此局勢已形成狄托及共產情報局公開破裂，但一方面狄托又重申其對蘇聯政府及東歐共產陣綫政府之忠心。</p>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒廿九日電〕南斯拉夫共黨中央委員會頃發表聲明，以最可能强硬之措辭，拒絕共產情報局對於南共之批評。南全國電台均轉播此項聲明。其中首先指出蘇聯共黨中央委員會曾於三月二十七日致函共產情報局之各國，對南共有强力的指責，蘇共中央委員會獨未以該函送致亦為共產情報局一員之南斯拉夫，亦未以此事通知南國。不久以後，匈共黨中委會致函南共中委會，重申蘇共中委會指責南共之各點，該函副本，曾送致除法義共黨以外之共產情報局其他各員。南共中央委員會認為共產情報局之各員，在未容南共聲辯以前，即已接受蘇共對南共之指責。嗣於四月及五月中蘇聯共黨曾先後三次致函南共，重申前此之指責。南共中央委員會茲特鄭重聲明，共產情報局對南共之一切指責，均屬向壁虛構的毀謗，尤足令詫異者，乃為南共曾一再致函建議在南實施就地調査指控各節藉明事實眞相，竟遭蘇共之拒絕。南斯拉夫共黨茲鄭重拒絕指控本黨袒護田主，並以過份嚴峻方式處罰黨員等節，誣指本黨不容他人批評，實為對於本黨最可恥可怖的侮辱。至於在若午部份內尙未舉行選舉，雖麗事實，要亦格於戰時及戰後條件所致。南共之聲明於逐點駁覆共產情報局所指控之各點後，乃曰中央委員會茲　請南共全體同志鞏固其團結支持政府，以為對於此等指責之唯一答覆。</p>
<h3>南共再號召與保阿結合　組織巴爾幹聯邦　蘇南發生裂痕主要原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十日廣播：南斯拉夫與蘇聯之分裂，今日更見尖銳化。狄托本日再度籲請南保阿三國締盟，按蘇聯早即表示反對此項盟約。據英外部稱，南蘇之分裂，係因狄托拒絕接受克林姆宮宮命令之故。又訊，共產國際總部決自南斯拉夫京城移至匈京。</p>
<p>〔路透社貝爾格勒卅日電〕南共黨機關報「波爾巴」首次聲明蘇聯共黨與南共發生裂痕的主要原因，據云，南國外交政策之主要目標，為組織南斯拉夫保加利亞及阿爾巴尼亞之聯邦，以為東歐軸心內地理上的一個單位，此一計劃遭蘇共黨某部份人士之反對，認為因此將削弱東歐集團的實力。此等意見其實錯誤，與保阿兩國組織聯邦，祗能促進東南歐之團結，對於各方面均有裨益。南斯拉夫共產黨將一貫的從事奮鬥，以謀加强並發展對蘇聯及其他人民民主國的合作，南共決不背離其現在及過去的對外政焚。南共雖不滿共產情報局宣言的措辭，但亦不允許其為目前東歐國家間的友好關係染上一層色彩。南共認為此次爭端，不過家庭內部之糾紛而已，並非不能妥協的衝突。</p>
<p>「波爾巴」發表之前項聲明，係包括在該報所揭載將由下週南共第五屆大會討論之南共計劃大綱之內，其計劃大綱聲明南斯拉夫民族及國家的獨立，為趨向社會主義及其一般進步的先決條件。即以「波爾巴」毅言，其宗旨在使南斯拉夫國家及共黨得以一貫地反抗帝國主義者企圖奴役南斯拉夫民族社會主義的祖國之陰謀。南共將力爭南斯拉夫疆界以內的政治與精神統一，以及對蘇及東歐其他國家最可能密切的合作，尤其當建立條件，使保加利亞與阿爾巴尼亞民族得以平等的基礎，與南斯拉夫民族團結一致。南共主張南斯拉夫人民共和國與蘇聯領導的反帝國主義民主勢力密切合作，以與反民主的帝國主義勢力及戰敗鬥爭。南共對於一切爭取和平，反抗干涉他國內部事務的國家及運動均將予以支持，並主張各國應本聯合國的原則，從事愛好和平的合作。南共並將對勞工的民主及國家解放運動以及為自由民主及社會生義奮鬥的民族，給予道義上及政治上的援助。（就最後一節觀，殆係專指希臘之遊擊隊活動而言）。</p>
<h3>蘇不容南斯拉夫　成為緩衝國</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿九日電〕此問消息最靈通的中立視察家相信，狄托及其他南共領袖如能承認彼等政策之錯誤而加以糾正，則仍可重返共產情報局陣容。共產情報局之八國委員認為南共領袖之企圖使南國成為美蘇兩大陣容問之緩衝國，顯然與共產情報局此項基本立塲相抵觸。蘇共對於此事之重視，可由蘇共三巨頭日丹諾夫·馬倫柯夫及蘇斯柯夫親自參加此次共產情報局證之。</p>
<h3>南國鄰希邊界　傳出緊密槍聲</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕羅馬電台報吿希南邊界傳來之消息稱，弗洛里那迤北南斯拉夫境內近希臘邊界處，業已發生戰事，南軍一營越界進入希臘躲避。希南邊界彼側傳出緊密之機關槍聲，希陸軍諜報人員謂南軍在南希邊界處駐有軍隊三師。</p>
<h3>捷人士觀感</h3>
<p>認狄托終必對蘇屈服</p>
<p>〔路透社普拉格三十日電〕捷克熟悉國際共產政策之專家相信，被共產情報局開除的狄托及南共領袖，捨變更南共政策以符共產情報局要求之外，別無其他途徑可循。蓋除共產情報局之諸國外，狄托賓雖期獲得其他國家支援的可能，所調布爾喬亞及資本主義的國家殆決不願支援被正宗共產主義斥為過份極權及過份左傾的政權，與狄托不利的因素，除共產情報局的壓力外，尙有南共內部所謂忠實同志的力量。斯拉夫集團諸國的經濟壓力，以及蘇聯在道義政治經濟及主義上的力量。故捷共人士相信狄托如繼續施行其過份極權的政策，縱可得軍人方面的支持，在國內外共黨的一致攻擊下，決難保全其地位，唯有與國內外黨人謀取妥協，始能保全其權力及聲譽。</p>
<h3>南在美資產　下週可解凍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣播：據悉南斯拉夫將自美國獲得三千萬美元之戰爭賠償，此為美國務院利用南國與蘇聯最近分裂之第一種步驟。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華感頓廿九日電〕權威方面稱：美政府可能於下星期即可將南斯拉夫在美資產五千五百萬元予以解凍，南斯拉夫亦將賠償美僑民因南國工業國營而遭受之損失二千萬美元，並以南幣賠償一九四七年在南國被擊落之美機兩架。權成方面透露此乃在華感頓談話之結果，與共產國際情報局之指責南共亳不相干，此可表示狄托極願與西方各國改善關係。</p>
<h3>義社會黨大會　投票決定路綫</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社熱諾亞三十日電〕南尼所領導之義大利多數派社會黨大會，今日對於繼續與共黨合作抑將宣佈對共黨採取獨立行動之問題，已建投票決定之階段。據觀察家今日指出社會黨傾向左翼之空氣極濃，但投票結果如何，現尙難以斷定。</p>
<h3>英外相將宣言　闡明對德政策</h3>
<p>艾登力言勿對蘇讓步</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕具文外相定三十日下午在下院發表有關德國的宣言，料將以堅强的措辭，譴責蘇聯的態度，並可能宜布設立未來西德國的基本決策。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三十日廣播：艾登今在英下院致詞，認為柏林事件係蘇聯對盟國之挑釁，英美法決不能讓步，否則將無法使義大利及斯坎的那維孤加入西歐聯盟，而為法義共黨張目。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾表示　美軍決留駐柏林</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣指：馬歇爾今日發表聲明，謂美國決繼續留駐柏林，不為蘇聯之封鎖所動。馬卿並謂，美方決以最多之飛機，以食物運往柏林，接濟民衆。</p>
<h3>柏林蘇軍佔領　昇起障碍汽球</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林三十日電〕美國空軍今日報吿柏林蘇軍佔領區上空已昇起障碍氣球，美機駕駛員已受警告勿飛越汽球上空。一般咸恐蘇軍對柏林空中遝糧路綫，將採取新封鎖。</p>
<h3>美代表團將訪問中日　調查各託管島嶼　安理會辯論託管地區管制權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕為研究美國在太平洋上權益之美國會代表團廿九日宣稱，該代表團且將赴中國與日本一行。據該代表團主席戈登談稱，參衆兩院外交委員會之代表，欲研究美國在太平洋上各島嶼之戰略上與國際方面之地位，幷研究此等島嶼與遠東諸國之一般關係，尤其對中國與日本，因此該代表團決訪問中國及日本兩地。彼等定於十一月九日啓程，共和黨衆議員克勞福被舉為該代表團副主席，共和黨衆議員富爾頓被舉為秘書。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿九日合衆電〕聯合國組織中何部份具有管制「戰略託管區域」之權乃中蘇菲代表在託管理事會中辯論之主題。蘇代表認為聯合國憲章僅授權安理會對戰略託管區域之各方面負責。菲代表則稱之為誤解憲章，渠認為託管理事會有甚大管制權，中國代表劉錯同意安理會必須着手行動，渠相信託管理事會由此乃具若于管制權。</p>
<h3>制定西德政府計劃　美英法重要會議　並謀早日解決柏林危機</h3>
<p>〔路透社佛朗克福三十日電〕可望產生設立西德政府最後計劃的英美法重要會議，已於今日在佛朗克福揭幕。美方代表團由美軍政府長官率領，代表有陸次屈拉普·陸軍部戰略部長魏德邁·柏林美軍司令霍萊，歐洲復興方案巡察使哈里曼等。</p>
<p>英方代表幽有英軍政府長官羅勃林·英外部德國問團顧問寇克貝屈烈克·英軍政府副長官赫勃特·柏林英軍司令勃朗强少將等，法方代表團由法軍政府長官寇尼許率領，代表共計十人。羅勃森今晨自柏林抵此後在機塲表示，將會同美法使西德政府獲得正式基礎。克萊亦吿記者調，此會將有肯定的事實表現，決非僅以空言為已足。羅勃森於會前並吿記者曰，渠對蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基所稱希望在柏林西區糧食存底消耗殆盡以前，柏林與西德間之鐵路即可修復以恢復貨運之語，並不重視，渠謂索帥此語，似屬動聽，但並無實際意義。總之，西方國家所要求者為行動決非空言。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿九日電〕華盛頓來電謂國務部聲明解決柏林危機的努力，將先在柏林由各軍政府長官交涉辦理，如遭失敗，始擬對莫斯科直接採取其他步驟。傳蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基於函覆英軍總司令羅勃森之際，已表示希望得在柏林存糧用罄以前，完畢柏林·海姆斯泰鐵路之修理工程而恢復貨運。</p>
<h3>蘇對柏林施壓力　欲促成對德和約</h3>
<p>華萊士評論柏林局勢</p>
<p>〔合衆社緬因州波特倫二十九日電〕華萊士今日稱：蘇聯對柏林加强壓力，可能係强迫促成對德和約之一種行動。渠在記者招待會中稱：，假如渠本人為總統，則將要求召開對德和會，以解決目前之柏林局勢。渠稱：和會應擬定和約，包括在一年內撤退一切德國之駐軍。渠稱：「余以為史達林必同意召開和會，余非為蘇聯之行動辯護，但余認為蘇聯最近之行動，係準備强迫促成對德和約之簽訂」。渠批評目前之美國外交政策，具有「極度危險性」。</p>
<h3>賴依對柏林事件　不擬提出安理會</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿九日電〕聯合國秘書長賴依今夜發表聲明，不擬在目前援引憲章第九十九條，將柏林問題提出安理會討論。英美法代表均不贊成以柏林問題提出安理會。</p>
<h3>美要求蘇恢復　南韓電力供應</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕國務部宣稱美駐蘇大使於廿六日曾向莫洛托夫提出照會，要求北韓當局立即恢復南韓之電力供應，並依照佔領協定談判付款條件。按南韓之電流自五月十四日起即遭停止。</p>
<h3>貝那多特聖地和平建議　阿聯盟勢力將拒絕　傳貝氏主設聯邦制支持猶太國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社開羅廿九日電〕據靈通方面廿九日息，聯合國調解專員貝那多特建議聖地永久解決辦法為巴勒斯坦成立聯邦國家，以猶太區歸聯合國託管。據稱，聯合國託管官員將阻止非法移民之進入巴勒斯坦。貝氏認為此點足以保障阿拉伯國家不為「復國主義者」所進攻。</p>
<p>阿拉伯聯盟政治委員會高級份子述及所傳聯邦制建議時談稱，如果此為貝氏之建議，此點不致為阿拉伯方面所能接受。關於建議內容現尙無官方報導，傳貝氏之建議長達五頁之多。</p>
<p>〔路透社開羅廿九日電〕此間阿拉伯負責人士相信員那多特之巴勒斯坦和平建議，由於不能滿足阿拉伯之目的，勢將被阿拉伯所拒絕。埃及報紙均預料貝那多特之和平使命將遭遇失敗，並認刻在開羅舉行之阿拉伯聯盟政治委員會，為「阿盟成立以來最重要的會議」。貝那多特建議的內容，雖尙未曾透露，然據關係方面透露，貝那多特雖已有重大讓步以迎合阿拉伯之條件，但渠仍堅決支持猶太國之設立，力主以色列國必須存在於巴勒斯坦的原則。就阿拉伯方面言，猶太國之在巴勒斯坦設立，固為阿拉伯絕對不容妥協的一點，然則貝那多特建議之難期成功，殆已屬必然之勢矣。</p>
<h3>末批英軍　撤離聖地</h3>
<p>海發港交猶太軍接管</p>
<p>〔路透社海發廿九日電〕巴勒斯坦末批英軍已於廿九日退出海發登艦返英，海發港已由英方交與猶太軍接管。</p>
<h3>反對優待日韓　英法態度一致</h3>
<p>英美雙邊協定即可簽字</p>
<p>〔聯合社華感頓廿九日電〕」中國及參加馬歇爾計劃之歐洲十六國對於准許日本及南韓恢復貿易之態度，在華感頓益見重要。今日公布之英美協定中，英國拒絕給予日本及南韓任何優惠待遇。法國亦在同樣協定中加以拒絕。義大利與愛爾蘭則允照辦。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿九日電〕此間頃發表英美雙邊協定，內分十三點，英國於協定中向美方提出諾言頗多，以符合馬歇爾計劃下美國援助之條件，協定將於七月五日及六日於下院進行辯論，如能於六日經議會通過，則或將由雙方代表澈夜簽字。</p>

<p>〔路透社華感頓卅日電〕美國民主行動會今日在民主黨內發動反杜魯門運動，擬在七月十二日在費城揭幕之民主黨全代大會中，擁護艾森豪將軍為民主黨總統候選人。觀察家雖信彼等之目的決不能達到，但認此舉意義乃在團結支持前羅斯福新政的自由份子，以謀制止在十一月大選中共和黨大獲全勝的威脅。</p>

<p>震災死亡人數超過五千</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京三十日電〕經地震毀滅之福井地區之絲及人造絲紡織工業所受之損失，卅日估計約在八十億與一百億日元之間。如以默市價格計算，則當在一百六十億至二百億之間。福井一帶有三萬六千架紡織機，佔日本全部之百分之廿八，大部份之製成品已被派輸入，以抵付進口之食物。但尙堪吿幸者，在受災最烈之地區，僅有福井區全部設備之十分之一。</p>

<h3>芬普選今日投票　社會民主黨地位增強</h3>
<p>〔路透社海爾辛基三十日電〕芬蘭人民將於七月一二兩日舉行投票，選舉國會議員，全國最近平靜無事，為過去所罕見。史達林初次向芬建議締結互助條約時之不安狀態，今已消滅。一般人民相信芬蘭已可免遭與捷克相同的命運。據揣測普選之結果，一般均料社會民主黨可望獲得最多票數，共黨與左黨合組之人民民主聯盟，將不免損失許多席次。在本屆議會中，人民民主聯盟佔五十一人席，社民然四十八席，農民然四十八席，保守聯合黨廿九席，代表芬境瑞典少數民族：瑞典人民黨十四席，自由進步黨九席，瑞典自由黨佔一席。社民黨自於五月間因共黨要求取得內長席發生政治危機結果，由社民黨擊敗共黨之計劃後，其地位已大為增强。共黨聲言在該次要挾性的罷工中，參加工人達十萬名，然官方宣布參加之工人實祗二萬五千名，僅佔工會會員百分之七·五，共黨素以罷工為其最有力之武器，自該次嘗試失敗後，共黨實力大遜。</p>

<p>工務提案順利通過</p>
<p>工務部份共廿一案·惟討論過程，最屬順利，大多均照原審査意見通過。茲擇要摘錄數案如次：（一）街路名稱，不得輕事更易，請市府參考。（二）復興南市，應組委員會，規定年期計劃，以促實現。（三）利用保甲組織，策動全面修路運動案。（四）請市府工務局指定棚戶搭蓋地點，並請儘量簡化請照手續，已搭好者請予保障。（五）為復興南市，請工務局計劃興建市房，以繁榮市面。（六）請迅速趕修浦東大道全程路面及橋樑。（七）請市府迅予撥款建築龍華區南北幹路。（八）請市府迅訂翻造房屋限制辦法，以杜業主利用翻造執照，勒遷圖利，增加房荒，影響治安</p>

<h3>滬軍營慘劇　燒死男女九命　前門火封後門關釘　欲逃無路但聞呼聲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市滬軍營廟橋路新銘里四十四號二房東粵人庚東勝，製造漆布為業，即在該號設一小型手工藝廠。昨晚九時五十分許，正値夜工之際，忽有火星竄入原料中，此項原料均為松香水·酒精·戤司令·廢影片等物，故一經着火，立刻烈燄飛騰，火勢猛烈。南市民辦東南西北各區救火會及新開河等消防區隊得訊，均驅帮浦車趕往施救，同時蓬萊警分局接到滬軍營派出所報吿後，由分局長吳克孝親率股長李大直，股員陸紀鴻，警員李顯汶·羅四維·朱根福，馳往火塲彈壓，幷調査起火原因。火燒約一小時始救熄，除焚去四十四號全幢石庫門外，並殃及左右兩隣四十三及四十五號。查四十四號後門平時關釘，故起火之後，屋中人均無路可逃，致有男女大小九口，慘死於火中，計二房東庚東勝（五十四歲），庚妻庚蓉英（五十四歲），子錦泉（廿七歲），媳沈阿妹（廿七歲），內姪女秦柳淸（廿二歲），孫女勵芬（一歲）；又亭子間中三房客譚繼枝（廿八歲廣東人，在登陸艇上任事），譚妻李素芬（廿四歲，分娩未久，尙臥在牀），譚女愛羣（纔一歲）。當時附近曾聞呼救之聲，但苦無法入內援出。消防人員至今晨二時許尙在火塲翻掘屍身。</p>

<h3>十大百貨公司　加薪談判決裂　資方臨時拒絕要求　報告社局請予調處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市永安·先施·新新·大新·麗安·麗華·國貨·中華·華新·泰昌等十百貨公司，勞資雙方因加薪問題，發生嚴重爭執。爭執遠因，在去年年底，當時勞方提出二項要求：（一）實行年終加薪每年增加底薪一元，（二）職工每人普加底薪十元。資方因營業狀况不佳，不能允許。嗣經社會局調解，雙方同意將加薪案保留六個月再討論。至前日（六月二十九日）六個月之期屆滿，勞資雙方各派代表在永安公司六樓重開談判。會議空氣甚為融洽，資方對職工收入徵薄，生活艱難，極表同情，對加薪問題，約定於六月卅日下午四時在原處繼續會議。昨日適為月底市府公佈生活指數之期，資方得悉職員指數為五十六萬倍之後，於下午會議中拒絕接受加薪原則，於是談判決裂。勞方代表將此消息帶至各公司後，職工情緒頗為激憤，咸表不滿。據該工會負責人稱：十公司職員薪給平均約底薪五十元左右，即依五十六萬倍指數計算，每月所得亦不過二千八百萬至三千萬元，縱使資方完全答應勞方要求，每人增加五百六十萬元，每月薪津總數仍不過三千多萬，以四口之家計算，僅能維持半月開支。且此案已牽廷半年，認為資方率爾拒絕，將使勞方反感極大，現雙方均已將談判決裂經過，申報社會局，請求調處。</p>
<p>又訊，華洋百貨業浙江路·南京路·四川路·林森路四區商店，勞資雙方雖無代表參加談判，然華洋百貨業之職工待遇，向以環球百貨業（即前列之十公司）為依歸，故昨日雙方分別與環球百貨之勞資當局取得速絡，將取同一步驟云。</p>
<h3>舞廳茶資　百廿萬元一杯</h3>
<p>本市各舞廳音樂師，以邇來物價飛漲，不克維持生計，乃於日前呈社會局請轉向資方要求加薪百分之一百五十倍，社局以音樂師係馬自由職業，可逕向資方商洽。頃悉業經推派代表與資方商討結果，資方已允予調整。據另悉：自今日起，各舞廳茶資亦將提高一倍至一百二十萬元云。</p>
<h3>西片商停供新片　影院業認為違法</h3>
<p>所蒙損失將請賠償</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕自本市九家西片商決定對各影院停供新片後，影院業公會昨特召開會議，商討對策。席間一致認為影院票價之限制，係根據我國政府法令，西片商不應將調整未合理想之咎諉諸影院。西片商停供新片之唯一理由，係根據合同上「不可抗力」條款，但政府法令非天災人禍，根本不能謂為「不可抗力」，且影院與片商雙方同意訂立之合同中，對票價並宋作硬性規定，片商尤不應擅自以停供新片為手段要挾漲價，故結果決議對西片商之行動視為違法行為，在其停供新片期內，各影院所蒙受之損失，當保留要求賠償之權。該公會昨已將決議紀錄送達各西片商。</p>
<h3>上月生活指數發表　工人七十一萬倍　職員五十六萬倍</h3>

<h3>南國潦水哀歌</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>〔本報廣州廿七日航訊〕入夏以來的南國，本來一切都還平靜，雖然港幣高漲的影響，牽着物價狂奔，早已超越京滬各地，但有了美援米配給之後，糧價總算穩定了一個時期，而且今年春間，雨水　　，農民們正額手稱慶，以為今年旱禾，豐收可望，紛紛準備龍舟於端節競渡，以預祝豐收，誰料好夢未償，却先來噩耗．一塲海外的颶風，隨着端午節吹來，接着還連天暴雨，使粵境內東·西·北·韓四江，山洪暴發，潦水猛漲，放出了水災的緊急警號，使一首喜悅和諧的南國田園交響樂，變了凄厲悲慘的哀歌，人們對豐收的一塲熱望，自然平就隨風而逝了！</p>
<p>狂風暴雨的影響</p>
<p>據珠江水利局的發言人說：這次水災不過是一塲暴風雨的影響所致，還沒有到農曆七月的潦水汛期，而這次水災僅是一個序幕，然損失已足駭人了。現在因潦水還未盡退，還不能有一個詳確的統計，根據各縣的報吿綜合起來，大約是這樣：東江潦水漲勢最烈，數日間水漲達二丈有奇，石龍的圓洲堤圍，首被冲破，缺口二百餘公尺，泛濫良田三萬餘畝，其餘惠陽·博羅·沿江禾田，悉遭淹沒。而新會·合山·開平以及南路湛江·遂溪等地災情，尤為慘重。新會水患災區之闊？佔全縣十分之七八，台山祗一區之內，被冲毀房屋達二千餘棟，災民數千，流離失所，人畜淹斃，與禾田損失，均無從統計。</p>
<p>四邑南路災情重</p>
<p>其餘南路方面：計遂溪一縣，被淹良田已達一萬餘畝，毀房屋達千餘間。湛江市內，房屋被毀亦在三千餘棟，居民遭沒頂淹斃及失踪者百餘人，逃出災居之居民無數，露宿路西營飛機塲，嗷嗷待哺，慘不忍聞。以四邑與南路兩處而論，這次水災換失的慘重，實在是百年來所未有。</p>
<p>宋子文主席於去年蒞任伊始，即揭示：防止水災是建設廣東先決的急務。於去年底成立了省堤工會，決定第一步工作，是要恢復去年水災以前的各堤圍，進而將各堤團加强培修，現在第一期工作亦巳結束。宋氏還擬定辦法，在數年內完成永久性的水利建設工程。</p>
<p>但願水災成尾聲</p>
<p>現在對救濟方面：粵水災　　了五百億元急賑台山。新會。開平各縣，另撥一百億元急賑湛江·遂溪·海康各將市，成立了四邑和雷湛兩個急賑團，均巳先後出發。另外對護堤力面：亦已由堤工會，水利局等，派出大批技術人員分赴谷地，指導民衆搶修缺堤。最近據各縣的報吿，邇來水勢雖猛，但各主要堤　，仍甚鞏固，尙無危殆之象。這次遽爾而來的水災，可能成為尾聲，目前急務，厥在加緊辦理善後救濟工作。</p>

<p>金少山化裝前便照（哈　黃君贈刊）</p>
<h3>藥爐邊的金少山</h3>
<p>— 本報記者洪正倫</p>
<p>『活覇王』金少山，是曾在江南名嗓一時的北國紅伶，而現在却悄悄地躺在北平一個古老幽黯的屋子裏，與藥爐茶灶為伴，度其病裏殘生，倍感身世的悲凉，至於命運如何，截至今日為止，我們還無法懸揣。想讀者中關注覇王生活的人頗多，所以本報記者作了一次訪問，分上下兩篇在這裏發表。（編者）</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日航訊〕金覇王病了，而且病得很兇了，他的病，一方面是由於歷年賣藝積勞所致，另一方面不能不說是因為他任性，乖僻，平日酒色過度所斵傷，但他的得病也可說是突如其來的。據評劇家哈殺黃先生說：在去年的一個冬天，金少山在三慶戲院演慰勞戲「靑風寨」之後，即嘔吐不止，氣息奄奄，當時情形極為危險，經一位姓荊的西醫診斷後，斷定為胃膜炎，注射後吐雖稍止，但並未脫險境。</p>
<p>不遵醫生囑　濫吃涮羊肉</p>
<p>荊先生囑他愼重飲食，尤須注意行動，但金少山並未遵辦，過了一天，飽餐了一頓涮羊肉之後，病勢就急轉直下了，起初是四肢痛疼，繼則全身浮腫，據醫生診斷為「神經末稍炎」，從那時起，病態一直在反反復復的狀態中綿延到現在，金覇王也就痛苦的　到現在，算來已半個多年頭了！</p>
<p>緊　着病的威脅，當然是貧，金覇王雖在藝壇享名數十年，然以過去揮霍成性黃金時代都不能留點積　，到今天當然只有兩手空空，所以經過這漫長的七個月花用，除典當變賣。來支持這一家生活費與醫藥費外，其他全都賴同行與友好贊助，數目雖然可觀，但以有限制的友情支援，來塡塞這無盡期的經濟窟窿，前途是可怕的。</p>
<p>「搭桌」義演　名角都幫忙</p>
<p>最近哈殺黃等發起，由北平名角裘盛戎·荀慧生·楊寳森·葉盛蘭·李多奎·馬富祿·尙小雲·譚小培·譚富英等，在長安戲院為金覇王來一次「搭桌」義演，如果能實現的話，這到的確是集一時北平名伶之盛，成績定有可觀，對他的病中當不無小補。記者訪他的時候，正是個酷熱的下午，覇王半裸着下體，圍着一塊布斜躺在病塌上，病房是在座北朝南的一排五開間的東房，因為長久無人收拾，寬敞的房子裏却顯得異常紊亂狹小。覇王的臉是那樣的焦黃，浮腫的雙脚，連轉動都不能，奇怪的是：嗓子還是那末宏，眼睛雖然還是那樣神彩奕奕，但比演戲時候的精神，那簡直差得太遠了。</p>
<p>脾氣市蹩扭　命運尚難卜</p>
<p>陪記者到他屋裏去的是專門侍候他的一位老朋友周硯臣，周先生已是六十二歲的老人了，是覇王的誌角交，是楊小樓的徒弟，習武生，自金少山病後，即專任侍候之職，當周先生向覇王說明來意後，金覇王略一欠身，表示讓座，因為久病的身軀，覇王懶得很，沒有多說話，我們就吿辭了。據周先生說：金三爺（因為他是行三，梨園行都呌他金三）脾氣蹩扭得很，大夫囑他只能吃點稀東西，但他要吃肉饅頭，炸醬麵，沒辦法，就這麽一個怪脾氣，連性命都不管的，言下不勝感慨。</p>
<h3>莫干山欣欣向榮</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>〔本報抗州廿八日訊〕由杭州去莫干山，先走京杭國道五十一公里到三橋埠，折入到莫干山麓庾村的公路七公里，車子走這五十八公里的路程，大致說來，比卅五年四月那種顚簸的狀態好得多了，而且有幾段路，相當平滑，橋樑亦經修整，里程路標亦極明顯。</p>
<p>抵莫干山脚下，挑夫和轎夫都待着你去使雇，如要用他們時得向在凉棚下的管理局職員交涉，挑一担東西，慢班五十萬元，快班七十萬元。一頂轎子，三名轎夫，要一百五十萬元。</p>
<p>山上白米賣一千萬元一担，猪肉賣二十六萬元一斤，鷄蛋賣一萬五千元一隻，除白米外，其他各物要較杭市為康，不過山間旅館價格奇昂，莫干山旅館，日需四百萬元，連伙食在內，還有復興旅館，綠蔭旅館等，價格都相當貴。</p>
<p>山上可可，嘡嘡，蓬蓬之聲不絕，許多房屋都在修理之中。全山有屋三百餘所，被毀的不過十分之〇點九模樣。紅屋綠瓦，雜於翠竹碧樹叢中，莫干山確有欣欣向榮的氣象。</p>
<p>今年很多屋主，都將房屋租與外國人，每屋租期三個月，租價四五十担米不等，來租的人以俄國人為最多，其他國人都是極其少數，美國人竟祗一二人而已。這許多俄國人，有的租得後在山中開飲食店，有的租得後讓與另外許多俄國人居住。</p>
<p>此間氣候凉爽，最高紀錄不超過八十度，入夜尤感寒意，睡眠必須蓋以被褥。淸晨可以看日出和雲海，傍晚可以看日落和迷濛的烟霧，莫干山唯一的缺點，就是沒有河與海，只是在某家屋內可以遙望太湖和錢江。</p>
<p>到底不是太平盛世，所以到山上來的外國人多於中國人，我們祈望，明年山中，中國人多於外國人。</p>

<h3>結匯證明書辦法實施後　出口業仍乏起色</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕結匯證明書辦法實施後，我國出口業仍乏起色。據進出口業人士分析其理由，不外下列各端：（一）國內物價飛漲，出口品價格亦上漲一倍以上，出口商限於資金，無力大規模收購。回時國外銷路不暢，商人以結匯期有一定，不得不低價售出，忍受虧損。（二）結匯證明書之市價，因受金融當局有計劃之壓低，較之美匯黑市，平均低百分之三十以上。而在結匯證明書售價不能與美匯黑市一致時，出口及僑匯均有問題。目前出口業之經營，已有兩項趨勢，一為小出口商本身因限於實力，不得不聯合大出口商辦理；二為對外商洋行之依賴，例如國茶出口，非洲為主要銷塲之一，而目下蕪茶之對非輸出，什九巳通過英法人經營之洋行而出口。</p>
<p>輸管會輸出推廣處六月廿日至廿六日一週內出。結匯，根據各指定銀行所送結匯證明書副本統計，上海一地約美金三百七十六萬元。其中蛋品約計八十五萬美元，猪鬃五十三萬美元，棉織品五十萬美元，桐油四十七萬美元，皮毛廿三萬美元。自新結匯辦法實施後，截至六月廿六日止，上海一地出口結匯共美金一千三百四十四萬元。</p>
<h3>行莊同業調撥頭寸　國行可儘量承匯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃自國行獲悉：關於同業調撥頭寸辦法，茲經核定，自本年下期開業日起，凡同業不論國家行局，或商業行莊，委請本行調撥其本身分支機構，或代理行處之匯款，當可儘量承匯，無論任何匯入地點，不再加以限制。其　往京·滬·粵·閩·等地之款，亦可逕行承匯，不必先經本行業務局核准。匯費暫定匯入地區係京·滬·杭·與華南區（閩·粵·桂·三省）各地，以及匯出地區係華北（冀·察·熱三省）各地者，一律按當地匪率八折收費，其他均仍按六折計收，倘各地介款行因券料不豐，介付有困難時，可逕向匯款行處商洽辦理。再同業電匯款項，應以交匯之次日介付為準，假期應剔隊，過期按存款利率給息，如於遲介期內已向本行拆款者，應依實際拆款情形，按拆款利率貼息，由介款行付帳，惟當地以券料不豐，無法應介退匯時，不予貼息云。</p>
<h3>華北申匯　決定開放</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕滬傳央行決定自七月三日起，開放各地匯兌，即對各地往來之匯款數額，巳不再加限制。據此間財部錢幣司方面息，關於匯款限額之開放，央行尙未與財部商討，惟華北申匯決定自七月一日開放，外傳想係華北申匯之誤。</p>
<h3>國家行局　提高匯率</h3>
<p>又訊：華南匯款自告開放後，國家行局對各地匯款匯率，昨決定自七月三日起，大事提高。並規定行局除華南匯率，按定價八折外，其餘各地一律六折，茲將新訂匯率列後：</p>

<h3>銅元鑄錢金屬輔幣　部令準許自由攜運</h3>

<h3>國行稽核處發表　五月份行莊存款</h3>
<p>國行稽核處昨發表五月份上海各行莊存款及準備金總額比較表如次：（一）活期存款九，一三九，五二三，一二九，六二〇·〇五元，（二）定期存款二，一〇七，八二六，六四六，九二八·九五元，（三）存款總額一一，二四七，三四九，七七六，五四九·〇〇元，（四）已繳準備金一，五六二，九七七，八二八，一六五·六七元</p>
<h3>七月份煤斤配價　增百分之六十八</h3>
<p>頃據燃料管理委員會主委張希為氏吿記者，本（七）月份配煤價格，業經該會擬定，較上月配價約漲百分之六十八。是項價格業經於日前呈送經濟部審核，一俟核准，即可正式公佈。張氏解釋此項配價闊步調整之原因稱，主要在於生活　　之飛速上升，及新進出口結匯辦法實施後，結匯證明醫價格飛漲，各礦廠器材之輸入及人工開支，成本日高，如配價再不作合理之關整，則各煤礦之生產，勢將陷於停頓云。</p>
<h3>文具廠商　改訂營業辦法</h3>
<p>最近本市物價，波動極烈，文具廠商，各以日常應用各項原料，進本逐日激漲，甚且有市無貨，生產至感困難，為維持血本計。特於三十日起，變更管業方法。並訂立辦法五項如下：</p>
<p>（一）定價之增减，在物價未獲穩定前，逐日視原料漲跌情形估算牌吿，不發新價單及通知。</p>
<p>（二）客戶必需每日向各該廠商詢明定價，免至交易時受虧。</p>
<p>（三）交易概請付現，期票不收。價目按照當時定價計算，不予差讓。</p>
<p>（四）外埠客戶購貨，以款到之日定價結算。</p>
<p>（五）原料缺乏，定貨暫停接受，祇能供給少量，以應門市要求。</p>
<h3>六底結賬銀根見緊　棉紗交易沉寂　布市或交不多喊價堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以六底關係，客帮與紗商大都辦理結賬，交易淸淡。四十二支藍鳳紗初開平庸，嗣因封關二日，本街複製廠略有進取，價見回好，卒以八億二千萬元結束，比上日步降一千萬元。廿一支雙馬紗市亦堅而復疲，結果軋小三千萬元，為六億三千萬元，其餘各紗堅疲互見。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以六底銀根緊迫，天津報價低落，晨初開市，五福細布上升卅萬，為二千零三十萬，有少數成交。旋因北帮有吐，小至一千九百萬，卒以二千萬元結束軋平。</p>
<p>塲外龍頭細布，喊價仍在二千一百五十萬邊徘徊，最後為一百四十萬元，較上日軋升二十萬元。其餘各布，以指數高，人心堅昂，市呈挺秀。</p>
<p>又訊：上日紡建公司開售之四君子嗶嘰，核定價為二千萬元，因川帮客商有搜購，做高至二千二百五十萬，嗣以銀根緊不乏吐售，十點時小至一百五十萬元，卒以二千一百八十萬收市，軋好一百八十萬元。</p>
<h3>全市各業市塲　今明兩日休假</h3>
<p>本月一二兩日為銀行半年總結賬日，各銀行錢莊均休假兩日。本市各市塲亦因銀行封關而紛紛停市，（一）證券市塲昨僅辦理交割，今明兩日休假。（二）棉紗棉布兩市塲，昨日仍有交易，買賣雙方均以本票交割完畢，今明停市兩日。棉織品呢羢類，亦相隨休假。（三）綢緞人造絲廠絲市塲亦自今日起，停市二日。（四）米麵雜糧汕豆餅等市場亦休假。（五）糖煤炭捲烟日用品橡膠燃料汕，自今日起，休假二日。（六）出口品猪鬃桐油五棓子等，昨均有市無交易，今明二日休假。以上各市塲均自三日上午恢復交易。</p>
<h3>義人絲將抵埠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕義大利人造絲約兩千箱，定七月五日抵埠。此批人絲抵達後，中信局將恢復配售。</p>
<h3>茶市依然堅秀</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，為銀錢業上半年度總結算期之最後一天交易，市上銀根雖續呈緊縮，但因同業頭寸大都軋齊，同時又聞紅綠茶產價巍站雲霄，是以執主心思咸拘穩健，對於各項花色，均無急於脫手之意，過程依然堅秀。價格方面，迂迥仍俏，且脚地亦頗鞏固，至成交數量，則以吐納談判並不順利，遂猶寥若晨星。</p>
<h3>合作社所開支票　不發生票據效力</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部前以各信用合作社，多有開發支票，致以合作社為付款人之支票，頗多流通於市面者。財部以此類支票與票據法第一百廿三條　規定相抵觸，已於三十六年九月廿六日下令取締。以後各信用合作社即發表聲明，認為發行支票，實為便利存戶，本質上與銀錢業無異。財部為愼重起見，特提請司法院解釋，據司法院五月卅一日統一解釋法令會議議決，根據合作社所規定，不能開發以合作社為付款人之支票。司法院並巳命今各地之法院，通知此項支票不發生票據之效力，並由社會部電令全國之信用合作社，勿再開發此類支票，白干法紀，財部並指令各地金管局，轉飭銀行錢莊不得收受此項支票。本市金管局亦已接得財局命令，並已轉知銀錢信托三業照辦。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>申報的地圖</h3>
<p>— 王奇</p>
<p>一位讀者的意見</p>
<p>申報的地圖在中國地圖史上是劃時代的，我們不妨說，自從此圖出版，中國才有新式的地圖。本年春天，我曾在大公報出版界上寫了一篇「談地圖」，特別推薦申報社的中國地形圖，該圖乃是掛圖，分為四張，拚成一整幅，等於把從前出版的分省圖集攏來張掛在壁上，編著者也是曾方二君，本來此圖是廿八年正當戰時出版的，所以滬上很少見（雖然還是中奉書局改稱的永寧公司印的）。去年冬天提出康售，定價僅僅八萬元，到本年二月，還是八萬，幾乎等於贈送，憑那種重磅木造紙和精緻的索引，時價非數百萬元不辦！我寫了這篇文章之後，當即接到南京曾世英先生來函，說，戰後改訂的地圖正在編製，希望我貢獻意見，這樣虛心，眞是學者風度，可惜我雖愛好地圖，唯於圖學，乃是十足的門外漢，即使想效野人獻曝，也無從作起，這一點，未免愧對曾先生了。我的回信只是說，希望新岡趕速出版，以　　下　需。而此一希望，眼看就將實現了。</p>
<p>老實說，在地形上，舊岡與新圖沒有什麼大分別，除非經緯綫及高度有新測量。所以坊本新圖，完全把舊岡拿來抄襲，至於東北新畫的省區，和新增的合灣省，都是取日人所繪，割裂改製的，有的也許連日人的東西都沒看，故能滿人意者殊不多覩。東北在日人經營下，人文情况改變甚多，新築鐵路，新闢工業城市，不知若干，若沒有詳細紀載，等於沒有東北的地岡。後期日人在東北頗致力於地岡之測繪，初期則日人竟亦抄自我國，即小林又七偷竊申報的中華民國新地圖之東北部分，改為新測滿洲地圖是也。小林又七是承印中國新地圓的，此事在曾先生所作的中華民國地形圖序文中述說甚詳，前兩天本報出版界曾先生的文章還曾提起。中國有此種新圖，而竟不能付印，實是恥辱。（上海有彫刻銅板的，但每年只能出兩塊，大地圖有五六十幅，勢非二十餘年不成功，言之足可駭人！）小林又七在日軍侵入時，曾於京滬設立支店，唯彼所印之圖，多屬軍用，外人莫得而窺。市面流行的，並不比中國的好，就連印刷紙張，到後來也拆濫汚極了。</p>
<p>好多人還不大淸楚中國新地圖和分省圖的不同，原來新地岡才是慶祝申報六十週年紀念的正式出版物，是一册空前巨大的二百萬分一地圖，不按省分幅，僅將全國截成若干單位，每單位為一幅，每幅又分人文自然兩圖，各於前面插繪索引，即於全岡中特將某一單位加印斜綫，以資指示。後面更附有地名總索引，等於一本地名辭典。此書出版時定價為廿五元，若按物價折合，目下該是五六千萬！也就因為讀者購買力和印刷需時的關係，才又編成一本分省圖，專供一般及學生使用，比例是三百萬分一，地形人文合一，分省成幅，這是大家習見的，不必我說了。至於前面說的地形岡，則又專為課堂敎授縣掛之用的，在地岡的編製上，可以算是盡善盡美了。</p>
<p>不過人心是不能饜足的，我們喜歡讀圖的人，絕不是一簿本分省圖可以滿意，我們非常期待中國新地圖之重新編繪。在沒有全部重編可能之前，若把東北·西南各省區及台灣先行增訂出版，作為已有新地圖者之補編，似乎也是一個辦法。不知關於此一事申報館和曾先生等的意見如何？又，聽說本市專以出版地岡為業務的大中國圖書局，巳在着手編製一嶄新的大地圖，其篇幅將與申報館的大地圖相埓，並且是分縣設色的。這個消息頗使人高興，好像由於申報館的導引，中國也有了專門製岡的出版商了。然而申報畢竟是老資格，我曾看到美國Times　Collier’s兩報館出版的地圖，其詳密都不見得能如申報館的。天下事只消得人，肯把錢花在有用的事業上，總會有優良的成績，於申報的地圖，我們又得了一個證明。</p>
<h3>乞丐日報</h3>
<p>— 松浦</p>
<p>維也納近郊有一家小酒店，在第一世界大戰前在那裏成立了一個「乞丐俱樂部」，至一九一四年，參加會員竟達一千八百人，因此創辦了一種「乞丐日報」，內容是乞丐福利消息，乞丐生活狀况，乞丐趣味讀物，乞丐中之偉人傳記，每份售價半便士，日銷四千份左右。據說一位有收集癖的匈牙利紳士，將「乞丐日報」全部收集起來，後以八十法郎售給了巴黎圖書館。</p>
<h3>謁文天祥詞</h3>
<p>— 施叔範</p>
<p>永嘉江心寺，為文山浮海南下勘王誓師處，迨後兵敗殉國，邑人立廟記之。詞雲水四　，兩浮圖分插東西，白鷺羣棲，盛暑鼓翅成雪，奇觀也。往際流亡，三度展拜，今忽忽可朔，已諭半紀，可慨也巳！</p>
<p>江流到海故迥折，山勢浮空欲動搖，雙塔長旋星月日，孤臣獨看寺雲潮；生排萬劫天仍附，死近千年虜尚半　，尾郭洗街新夢過，伏碑無涙器前朝。</p>
<p>層　遙控水飛揚，不斷鐘聲出上方，對此江城難獻默，嗟公身手最堂堂！山曾變色誰之過？國尚褒忠　已荒。漫續中興何代事？料知人鬼兩　惶。</p>
<p>八年烽火獨登臨·浮郭車　漠漢深，海氣黃殘桑麥影，市燈紅蝕士民心，已無牛酒祭三月，但見　　揮萬金，古佛不言魚鳥散，可能入地與披襟！</p>
<p>脚踏飛塵鬢滿沙，長年流轉若為家，人因薄義忘柴市，我自揚帆到永嘉，檻外荒寒鴉潑墨，江心鬰怒浪開花，臨歸得鑑衣冠影，一棹天靑日未斜。</p>
<h3>畢業與失業</h3>
<p>— 屏溪</p>
<p>近來在報上時常讀到關於今年夏季大學畢業生出路問題的呼籲和消息，大多強調說有三萬到五萬的青年，都將自覺校走向社會，實在不容易安插。這本是每年暑期前後常有的情形，可是今年似乎更覺得嚴重一些，猶如法幣出籠的造成通貨泛濫游資充斥一樣，人材的膨脹，使得本來就是人浮於事的現象，更為明顯。</p>
<p>如果畢業就是失業，那麼又何必白費幾年窗下的光陰呢？但也有人說，即使不進學校，不畢業，在這社會裏也是多半要失業的。前幾天有一個國立學校的公費生，為了怕畢業了沒有公費可以供養，而情願留校讀書的事。學校簡直成為一個短期的失業收容所了。若以讀書為職業，那末畢業等於解雇，畢業的結果自非失業不可。</p>
<p>畢業生的所以找不到事，一半是為了敎育與實用脫節，所以別人寗可挑選一個沒有文憑而有經驗的人來任職，却不願讓學士們來濫竿。此外，還有一個緣故，就是靑年們得到了文憑和學位之後，往往自命不凡，於是一出茅盧，抱負和期望都不小，平常的位置不放在眼裏，更不用想呌他們去幹工幹農。知識份子的供過於求，實在與他們自己的趾高氣揚也不無關係。</p>
<p>這當然是敎育的失敗。大學校所培植出的「人才」，怎麼可以都成了失業後備軍！然而學生們自己也很應當反省一下。你們如果願意滲透到這擁擴的社會中來，則首先必須揚棄那種「士大夫」們常有的優越感！</p>
<h3>南湖船娘</h3>
<p>— 紉嫻</p>
<p>到嘉興來玩的人，當然必到南湖；去南湖的人，又必需雇船。假如僅到過一次的遊客，恐怕很少有知道這種船也有種種不同，作者因為寄籍嘉興，因此略知一二。</p>
<p>普通站在東門橋附近的船娘，遇有外籍客人走過，即兜上來問「南湖去嗎」的那種，都是「老太婆船」。老太婆的年紀，大約不出四五十歲。她們的打扮和鄉下婦人完全一樣，常是藍布或白布短衫，黑布長褲；不過收拾得還整潔。</p>
<p>另一種呌「姑娘船」，船上有一個並不搖船的姑娘，專作招待員（招待員三字是我給她提取的）。搖船的仍是老太婆。姑娘都稱老太婆為「姆媽」。這些姑娘却並不上岸兜主顧，她們的年齡，十七八的廿一二的都有。凡雇姑娘船的人，當然多數是男客。她們的船價比老太婆船要大上數倍，譬如現在雇一只老太婆船要三四十萬元，那麼姑娘船就要二三百萬了。有的客人常帶了姑娘上「烟雨樓」，陪着遠眺近覽，吃茶進點，這個姑娘就自以為是紅運高照了。</p>
<h3>綠窗小語</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>夏天，我是喜愛鄉村的。碧綠的田野，濃蔭的山林，點水的蜻蜓，穿梁的燕子，以及那富有詩情畫意的瓜架豆棚……一切都顯示着一種靜穆，悠閑，恬適的氣氣。老杜詩云：「淸江一曲抱村流，長夏江村事事幽。一這是多麼一幅可愛的畫面。所以我覺得夏日鄉居，無論如何是比日處軟紅塵中的鬧市，要清爽有致得多的。</p>
<p>最令人嚮往的，無過於西湖花隱翁夏日的花間日課，如云：</p>
<p>「晨起芰荷為衣，傍花枝吸露潤肺，敎鸚鵡詩詞。禺中隨意閱老莊數頁，或展法帖臨池。晌午脫中石壁，據匡床，與忘形友談齊　山海。倦則取左宮枕，爛遊華胥國。午後剖椰子杯，浮瓜沉李，搗蓮花飲碧芳酒。日晡浴罷蘭湯，掉小舟，垂釣於古藤曲水邊。薄暮籜冠蒲扇，立高崗，看園丁抱甕澆花。</p>
<p>此種生活，不啻神仙，眞是「理想化」之至了。讀此一段文字，令人洗却滿身塵俗，肌骨為之一爽。閉目冥想中，恍如置身另一境界，飄飄乎「此中與世暫相忘」。太史公云：「雖不能至，而心嚮往之。」我於此亦然。</p>
<h3>酸葡萄與阿Q</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>三十年來，阿Q已給談膩了。人們巳最詳盡的替阿Q翻了年譜，考了身世；還替他上了舞台，出了國。因此我現在再來談阿Q，舊調重彈，似乎大可不必。記得魯迅先生初生阿Q時，闔家抱了這個難產的麟見，一顰一笑，確是不勝感慨的樣子。但後來白開水愈加態多，茶葉也就越冲越淡。時至今日，聽見人家說起阿Q，頂多憶起了「兒子打爺」或「與吳媽睏覺」等等片斷的故事，有誰肯費三分鐘思索一番，算是不勝希罕的了。好比劉老老最後一次進大觀園，眼看着寗榮二國府的衰敗，難免有點滄桑之感，我眼看着阿Q身價的今非昔比，眼睫毛也不免有點風吹草動。</p>
<p>人們說阿Q非牡丹，並不是我國的特產品，外國也有善吃酸葡萄或甜檸檬的。酸葡萄是一種自圓其說：人們吃不到葡萄，就說葡萄是酸的。甜檸　也是一種自圓其說：人們旣吃了酸檸檬，偏說檸檬是甜的。很多人遺忘阿Q，即因為覺得外國葡萄也是酸的或檸檬也有甜的。阿Q好像已在我們的心坎裏三十而立，消極，懦弱，與無知跟我們熟戀太久，竟無法使我們看淸這個愛人。做官的不求效率，只要淸風而來，淸風而去，算是一等好官；當兵的只要不是臨陣脫逃，也算是一等好兵。商人但求糊口；學生只要及格。誰都不曉得自己是為生活而吃飯，還是為吃飯而生活了。</p>
<h3>編製中的中國新圖（三）</h3>
<p>— 方俊</p>
<p>抗戰期問美十四航空隊施測範圍幾及全國之半。試自雲南騰衝至熱河之承德畫一直綫，則在此綫之東南部分多巳攝影，軍用地圖供應處參照製成航行圖，其優點在於地形迫眞，雜如河流曲折，湖泊形狀以至海　沙洲之蔓延，莫不與晚近實際情形吻合。本版新圖，多取資於此。</p>
<p>至日人在佔領期間，在蘇皖一帶之航測工作亦曾編為五萬分一圖。本圖壽縣南瓦埠河據以改善。又合灣測量早已大部完成。本圖所用者為美國翻印之五萬分一地形圖，除新高山附近外，大部完整。</p>
<p>最後：當須一述西北之資料，西康省東部大槪以該省地質調査所所長崔克信先生之路綫為藍本。崔君在康調査數年，足跡所至遍及康東。所惜限於儀器未能作高程之觀測，靑，新二省北部用美人翻印之俄國地圖，此圖比例尺為一百五十萬分一，出版於一九四一年。地形用　滃表示，間有高度記載。新疆省中尙有前中瑞科學考察團之成果，在瑞典整理幾及十年，最近在美國出版。按照計劃應有十三幅，此間僅得三幅。美國軍用地圖供應處亦在同一區域編有百萬分一圖，皆為珍貴資料。</p>
<p>關於編裏方法首先須略述新圖之體裁及圖幅之分配。本圖包括總圖及各種統計圖十四幅，分省圖二十五幅。前者比例尺大致為一千五百萬分之一</p>
<p>後者則除蒙古外皆為三百萬分之一。每幅以省為單位，印刷至紙邊，城市及其他插圖一概不附於圖上，俾鄰近岡幅可以接合，凑成任何區城之整幅圖。為滿足此項要求，不須採用一個單純之投影，各幅為其一部分。本圖所用投影為蘭勃脫投影，標準緯綫在北緯二十四度及四十八度。應用此稱方法之最大缺點乃為中部（北諱三十六度處）之量度差誤達百分之二·二，亦即在此綫附近地面一公里之距雕在圖上之長度為儿百七十八公尺。此種比例尺之差異不難用一定之方法推算之，而對於一般川圖之人影響固極微小也。惟為滿足此項互相銜接之條件，繪製方面人力及紙張之消耗幾達三倍。蓋從前省外部分例用插岡以掩蓋，今則必須全部繪畫，無取巧之餘地。</p>
<p>每圖之背面用單色印製各該區域之交通圖，表示鐵路公路之每一車站及里程以及河流之通航情形。</p>

<h3>Preliminary Review of the Provisional Property Tax Bill Completed; Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee to Report to the Plenary Session for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Provisional Property Tax and Investigation of Tycoons' Capital Group of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 30th, chaired by Jian Guan San.

For those whose total property value exceeds 50,000 yuan but is less than 250,000 yuan, a tax rate of 5% will be levied on the excess amount. The tax rate on the excess amount will be progressively increased for those with higher total property values. For those whose total property value exceeds 3 million yuan, a tax rate of 50% will be levied on the excess amount; (3) The starting point for the net asset tax rate of profit-making enterprises will remain at 300,000 yuan in the currency value of 1937. For those whose total property value exceeds 300,000 yuan but is less than 500,000 yuan, a tax rate of 5% will be levied on the excess amount. The tax rate on the excess amount will be progressively increased for those with higher total property values. For those whose total property value exceeds 3 million yuan, a tax rate of 25% will be levied on the excess amount; (4) The tax amount for profit-making enterprises engaged in industry, mining, and transportation will still be reduced by 50% compared to the tax amount for general profit-making enterprises. In addition, the provision passed at the previous meeting regarding the encouragement of foreign investment, which allowed the government to grant tax reductions and exemptions on the property of foreigners and overseas Chinese in China depending on the nature of their business and property, was re-examined. It was decided that foreigners and overseas Chinese should not be given special preferential treatment beyond that of ordinary citizens, which would create loopholes in the law. Therefore, the provision was canceled. At this point, the preliminary review of the Provisional Property Tax Bill was completed, and the initial draft of the regulations can be reported by the group to the Finance and Economics Committee for discussion after it has been organized.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] When the Standing Council of the National Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting to discuss the draft Property Tax Law being discussed by the Legislative Yuan, they all believed that this law would greatly benefit the balance of social wealth and the suppression of rebellion and the building of the country, and advocated that the Legislative Yuan should pass and implement it immediately, expressing that the workers of the whole country would swear to be the backing.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Central Standing Committee Discusses the Issue of Provisional Property Tax</h3>
<p>Committee Members Believe Now Is Not the Time to Levy</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a routine meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, chaired by Ni Wenya. The issue of levying a provisional property tax was discussed at the meeting. Many people spoke, and some committee members believed that it was not the time to implement the levy of a provisional property tax because if only real estate was targeted, it would cause such wealth to shift even more towards gold and currency, and floating capital would flood the market even more. In addition, the investigation of property is extremely difficult, and it is not appropriate to only calculate real estate. The discussion was lengthy, but no conclusion was reached.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid Utilization Committee Officially Established Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Executive Yuan's U.S. Relief Material Handling Committee, which was established to implement the Sino-U.S. Relief Agreement, has completed its mission and ended yesterday.

Starting in August, it will be the responsibility of 賴普漢 (probably Paul Ruppert) and this committee. He announced that the amount of U.S. aid materials that have arrived in Shanghai is 98,000 bales of cotton and 3,500 tons of food.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Drafting Committee Passes the Impeachment Case Review Rules; Subcommittee Discusses the Case of Submitting Legal Issues to the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Control Yuan held its 14th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, chaired by Yu Youren. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the previous meeting, Chen Darong reported that after the Control Law passed had been sent to the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Committee had decided to use the original case as a blueprint to redraw it. Therefore, the General Assembly should authorize President Yu to contact the Legislative Yuan and ensure that the spirit of the original case is maintained. Furthermore, according to the organizational regulations, the total number of employees in the various committees and administrative offices of this Yuan is over 2,000. In consideration of the national financial difficulties, the President had reduced the number of employees, which was approved by all the committee members, but there should be at least four people in each committee and no less than 20 people in each administrative office in order to facilitate the progress of the work. Committee Member Tang Honglie also reported on the proceedings of the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th, first describing the twists and turns of the Yuan's proposal, and then explaining the two hopes of the Legislative Committee for this Yuan: (1) The work of the democratically elected Control Yuan should focus on fighting tigers in the future; (2) The Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan should closely cooperate and coordinate. Finally, he stated that the Constitution does not stipulate that the Control Yuan has the right to submit legal cases to the Legislative Yuan and hoped that the President could find a way to remedy the loopholes in the Constitution to determine the legislative procedures of the Control Yuan. Li Zheng'e expressed regret that the first legal case proposed by the Control Yuan was rejected and proposed four remedial measures. Ni Bi also believed that there was indeed a suspicion of preventing the Control Yuan from proposing legal cases when drafting the Constitution and that remedies should be sought in the future. At this point in the discussion, President Yu announced the formation of another committee to handle this case specifically. (Then the case of "Please urge the government to expedite the peace treaty with Japan" proposed by Zou Lu et al. was discussed, see left corner)</p>
<p>Finally, someone proposed that the various regulations of the Control Yuan, such as the draft rules for receiving petitions from the people and the review rules, should be drafted first and then submitted to the meeting for discussion. The various units immediately recommended one person to form a committee to review the cases.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the Control Yuan held a subcommittee meeting to discuss the issue of the Control Yuan submitting legal cases to the Legislative Yuan. Twenty-three committee members attended, chaired by Cui Shuyan. Two resolutions were made: (1) The various committees and the administrative offices of the Control Yuan urgently need to be established. The organizational regulations should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to request prompt promulgation and implementation in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 8 of the Control Yuan Organization Law; (2) In accordance with the provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution, the President is urged to convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan (the heads of the Legislative, Control, and Judicial Yuan) to discuss and resolve the issue of the Control Yuan submitting legal cases.</p>
<p>In addition, the drafting committee for the impeachment case review rules held a meeting at 3:30 PM. Twenty-seven committee members attended, chaired by Wang Guanwu. The previous Control Yuan's review rules were discussed item by item. Except for the name being changed to "Control Yuan Impeachment Case Review Rules," the rest was slightly amended in wording and then passed, and it will be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion on the 1st.</p>

<h3>Government Improves Overseas Remittances; Yu Hongjun Says New Measures Have Been Drafted; Preferential Treatment Will Be Given in Terms of Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held its fourth meeting on the morning of the 30th. Yu Hongjun, Governor of the Central Bank, and Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, were invited to attend and report on issues such as overseas remittances and overseas Chinese capital. Xu Baiyuan reported that in order to assist overseas Chinese in returning, the government has launched a overseas Chinese return loan program, which has already loaned out 1.6 million U.S. dollars. The Ministry of Finance is planning to assist overseas Chinese investing in their homeland. Xu reported on the situation of overseas remittances, stating that before the war, annual overseas remittances were as high as 100 million U.S. dollars, and at least 50 million U.S. dollars. After the value of the legal tender depreciated after the war, overseas remittances in 1946 were only over 32 million U.S. dollars, and in 1947 only over 20 million U.S. dollars. Currently, it is less than 500,000 U.S. dollars per month. The government is determined to find ways to encourage overseas Chinese capital to return to the country. Yu Hongjun then reported on the reasons for the decrease in overseas remittances and the new measures to be adopted. According to Yu, there are three reasons for the decrease in overseas remittances: (1) The difference between the official exchange rate and the black market is too large; (2) The branches of overseas remittance agencies are insufficient, the efficiency is not high, and they do not meet the psychology of overseas Chinese; (3) Transportation is blocked, and postal and telecommunications are inconvenient. Regarding how to secure overseas remittances in the future, attention should be paid to the exchange rate issue. A new method for improving overseas remittances has been drafted and is being submitted to the authorities for approval. Once approved, it can be implemented. After Yu, Xu, and others finished reporting, Wu Shangying, Wu Zhimei, Chen Ruzhou, and others successively raised questions, expressing dissatisfaction with the confiscation of gold brought back by overseas Chinese when they returned to the country, and put forward several suggestions, which were answered by Yu, Xu, and others respectively.</p>
<p>Key Points of Improving Overseas Remittances</p>
<p>The key points of improving overseas remittances are as follows: (1) For foreign exchange obtained from the sale of overseas remittances by designated banks, the government shall stipulate that the Central Bank purchase the proof of sale at a special price comparable to the black market price; (2) For foreign exchange accepted by designated banks under overseas remittances, the Central Bank may issue an overseas remittance exchange certificate. In addition to selling back to the Central Bank at a special price, it is stipulated that when applying for foreign exchange for approved imported goods with an overseas remittance exchange certificate, 75% is equivalent to 100% (i.e., 25% higher than the general exchange certificate) of the ordinary exchange certificate to show preferential treatment; (3) Designate certain national banks to absorb foreign currency deposits abroad. These foreign currency deposits are limited to U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars. Yu Hongjun said on the 30th that the above method has not yet been finalized and may need to be supplemented and amended.</p>
<h3>Bridgeman's Letter to Marshall: Criticizing Delay in Military Aid to China; U.S. Notifies China of Methods to Utilize Military Aid Funds</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 29th] Senator Bridgeman, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Marshall on the 29th, denouncing the U.S. government for "violating the deep concern of the American people" by delaying military aid to China. The letter stated in part: "Due to the Chinese government's need for military supplies and economic assistance, and the deep concern of the American people for maintaining China's independence, the U.S. Congress authorized and ordered the Export-Import Bank to prepay $50 million in aid to China on April 3, 1948. From April 3 to the present, the U.S. government has not used any part of this fund to purchase military supplies needed by the Chinese government. The U.S. government has been particularly dilatory in using the advance funds for the aid to China plan. Although the advance funds for the aid to Europe plan were available in April, the military aid to China fund under the same act did not begin to be issued until mid-June, and since the regulations for the use of the fund were issued, it has never been used for aid to China. I hope that you will explain in detail to the Senate Appropriations Committee why the State Department has been slow to act on this urgent matter. This committee also hopes to receive assurances that prompt action will be taken to fulfill the wishes expressed by Congress in Public Law 472, enacted last April."</p>
<p>[Another Cable] The State Department immediately refuted Bridgeman's criticism that the State Department had violated the wishes of Congress by delaying military aid to China on the 29th. According to the State Department, the differences between the House and Senate bills on the aid to China bill were recently resolved by a joint committee of the two houses. The foreign aid bill was just signed by President Truman on the 28th, and the methods for the Chinese government to utilize the $125 million in military aid to China funds that are now available were sent to the Chinese Embassy on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Member Zou Lu and Others Request the Government to Expedite a Peace Treaty with Japan; the Case's Importance Leads to Decision to Discuss at Next Session</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The case proposed by Supervisory Committee member Zou Lu and 94 others, "Requesting the Government to Expedite a Peace Treaty with Japan," was discussed at the 14th meeting of the Supervisory Committee on the morning of the 30th. First, Zou Lu explained the content of the case, with the main point being that the government should proactively and autonomously promote a peace treaty with Japan, which would be beneficial to both international peace and the current anti-American and pro-Japanese trends. Zou's explanation lasted 20 minutes. Chen Zhiming and others then spoke, unanimously agreeing that the case was important and should be studied further before being discussed at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Proposal</p>
<p>The full text of the proposal submitted by Committee Member Zou Lu and 94 others: "Requesting the Government to Expedite a Peace Treaty with Japan" is as follows:</p>
<p>In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], in view of the intensity of the war, we believed that for the sake of the permanent happiness of the world and humanity after the war, we must not sow the seeds of revenge and cyclical retribution. Therefore, we proposed that the solution to post-war international problems should reverse the mistakes of the previous "Treaty of Versailles." In addition to advocating the eradication of the Axis powers' ability to invade, the principles should be as follows: (1) Eliminate the concept of victors and vanquished; (2) There should be no regional discrimination; (3) There should be no ethnic discrimination; (4) Economic problems should be resolved with equal and reasonable adjustments. After the end of the War of Resistance, the national policy once again made a very clear statement, expressing magnanimity towards Japan, which first invaded our country and caused the world war. Therefore, we never wanted to hinder the survival of the Japanese state and its people. Thus, we do not oppose supporting Japan. However, recently there has been opposition to the United States supporting Japan in our country, and even Australia and the Philippines have shown this opposition, which is an extremely unfortunate event in East Asian international relations. Although the United States has explained its actions in improving naval bases such as Liangxu, Sasebo, and Wu Port, establishing the Maritime Safety Agency and providing it with submarines and destroyers, expanding airfields on Kyushu, Honshu, and Hokkaido islands, retaining its aircraft manufacturing plants, increasing the number and equipment of Japanese police, training Japanese pilots, and allowing them to serve, and increasing the production of steel, shipbuilding, and textiles, the results are still not understood by people. In particular, the proposal to drastically reduce Japan's reparations, even to as low as just over $100 million, and the fact that three years have passed since the armistice without the sentencing of important Japanese war criminals, are especially difficult for our country to understand. In terms of our country's history, the United States has always been our closest friend, and in this War of Resistance, not only did it contribute greatly to the world, but China received a great deal of spiritual and material assistance from the United States before and after the war. There is no reason for our people and the people of the world to oppose the United States. The current situation is due to the failure to conclude a treaty with Japan. The United States cannot but perform its duties entrusted by its allies, and the true picture of the exercise of its powers is not understood by various countries, especially China, which is directly concerned. Therefore, there is a sense of unease in society. The most urgent task now is to conclude a peace treaty with Japan. If it can be concluded, the treaty nations can exercise their powers according to the treaty, without the United States being solely responsible for accusations from all sides. At the same time, with a treaty to rely on, if there is bias, the treaty nations can jointly correct it according to the treaty, instead of relying on one-sided judgments and blaming the executor. This is not only beneficial to the treaty nations, but also especially beneficial to the United States, which is currently solely responsible. Even from Japan's perspective, once a peace treaty is concluded, it will turn an enemy into a friend, instead of Japan still being in the position of an enemy four years after the end of the war. Although war reparations must be paid, there will be a certain budget to carry out its production and distribution methods, on the one hand bearing the responsibility for war reparations, and on the other hand being able to provide for its people's livelihoods. As for the judgment of war criminals, Japan should not cherish them at all, as they are not only a scourge to the world and China, but also a scourge to Japan itself. Otherwise, Japan today enjoys the welfare of a first-class nation, and its people enjoy prosperity. Therefore, the conclusion of a treaty with Japan is not only beneficial to East Asian international relations, but also especially beneficial to the United States and Japan. Since the beginning of history, there has never been a case where a peace treaty has not been concluded three years after the cessation of hostilities. This should be urgently promoted by China, the first country to be invaded.</p>
<p>Some people believe that since a treaty with Germany has not been concluded, a treaty with Japan cannot be carried out. In fact, Japan was the first to invade, and a treaty should be concluded with Japan first. Moreover, the German issue is complex, while the situation with Japan is simple. Furthermore, treaties with Italy, Austria, and Hungary have already been concluded, so there is no reason why a treaty with Japan cannot be signed.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of our own country and maintaining friendly relations with the United States, and for the sake of Japan's national stability, we should take the initiative on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, actively seek good strategies to break the past deadlock, and actively engage in indispensable preparatory work, drafting a treaty based on the principles decided in previous meetings. In this way, we can not only clarify our country's position on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, but also dispel the misunderstandings caused by the "anti-American and pro-Japanese" movement, and the position of China in East Asia can also be established. In the past, the government has followed the attitude of the Allies for its actions and inactions, and has failed to adopt a proactive policy, which should be corrected. Is this appropriate? Please decide.</p>

<h3>Editorial: From the Berlin Crisis to the Tito Incident</h3>
<p>Just as the Soviet Union cut off water, electricity, and rail transport to the British, American, and French zones, causing a serious crisis in Berlin, the Cominform suddenly decided to expel Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia from the party and called on the people of Yugoslavia to resist their government and replace its leaders. This not only caused a major rift in the Eastern European bloc, but also led to a deterioration in relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Communist Party leaders believe that the Soviet Union's threat to Yugoslavia's independence is far greater than that of capitalist countries, while the Soviet Union believes that the Yugoslav Communist Party leaders, led by Tito, have adopted erroneous policies that violate Marxism-Leninism, and have repeatedly slandered the Soviet Communist Party and its leaders, doing everything possible to oppose the Soviet Union. Due to the mutual accusations between the two sides, this "Tito incident" occurred, which shifted the focus of the "Cold War" between the Eastern and Western blocs from Berlin to Belgrade.</p>
<p>Although the state of war ended long ago after Nazi Germany surrendered in Europe, it has been three years since then, and the peace conference on Germany has not yet been convened, let alone a peace treaty. This is truly an unprecedented strange phenomenon in modern history. Moreover, the so-called German issue has long been qualitatively changed. On the surface, it is still called the German issue, but in reality, it has become an overt and covert struggle between the Eastern and Western blocs in Europe. At the beginning of the end of the war in Europe, the four powers—Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union—had the same attitude on how to deal with the aftermath of the war and how to deal with defeated Germany. Everyone was willing to create peace in Europe in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. Everyone also advocated disarming Germany, eliminating Nazi aggression ideologies, and holding Germany responsible for compensating the losses suffered by the Allied countries during the war, so as to ensure that defeated Germany could become a truly peace-loving democratic country and would never again become a threat to European peace. Unexpectedly, in the past three years, in various international conferences, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, due to differences in ideology and conflicts of interest, they stood at two extremes on both the German issue and other European issues, and were mutually antagonistic. Since the last foreign ministers' conference held in Moscow last year ended in discord, the German issue has been deadlocked, and other European issues have been impossible to discuss. As a result, the European deadlock has not only not eased, but the Eastern and Western blocs have gone their separate ways, drifting further and further apart.</p>
<p>Taking the U.S. and Soviet policies toward Germany as an example, it can be said that fundamental changes have taken place. In the past, both sides aimed to prevent Germany from rising again to invade, but today it has become that both sides want to use Germany as a tool to resist the other side. For example, in the Soviet occupation zone in East Germany, the Soviet Union has always tried to win the hearts of the German people in order to incite anti-American sentiment among the Germans, and attempted to establish a "German People's Government" in Berlin, calling on the German people to unite and unify, and drive the forces of Britain, the United States, and France out of Berlin. On the Western powers' side, they have also abandoned the previous policy of strictly controlling Germany, and want to adopt a policy of supporting Germany's revival, wanting to turn Germany into a fortress to resist the invasion of communist forces into Western Europe. Therefore, under the leadership of the United States, first there was the merger of the British and American occupation zones, then there was the conclusion of the West German Agreement, and recently West Germany implemented currency reform, all of which can be regarded as manifestations of the policy of supporting Germany and opposing the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the past three years, the overt and covert struggles between the Eastern and Western sides in Germany have never stopped. Although there is no bloodshed, it is also a kind of invisible and silent duel, which is generally called the "Cold War" by political commentators. Recalling the results of several Cold Wars, although the Eastern and Western sides have each had their victories and defeats, they have ultimately divided Germany into two Germanys, East and West. After the establishment of the West German Agreement, the Soviet Union adopted a "cold siege" strategy against Berlin, cutting off the water, electricity, and rail transport to the British, American, and French zones, creating a crisis in Berlin, attempting to drive the forces of Britain and the United States out of Berlin, in order to counteract the impact caused by the West German Agreement. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department openly accused the Soviet Union's "cold siege" of Berlin as a "unilateral act of challenge," and General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, also said: "The Soviet Union is now implementing its final pressure, attempting to drive us out of Berlin, but no matter what, unless it resorts to war, any action taken by the Soviet Union will not succeed."</p>
<p>From this it can be seen that the deterioration of the Berlin crisis is enough to constitute a serious threat to European peace, which is by no means the pessimism of alarmists. The authorities of Britain, the United States, and France all attach great importance to this matter, and it is reported that they will take joint action towards Moscow, lodging a protest with the Soviet government, on the one hand demanding that the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally lift its "cold siege" of Berlin, and transferring the Berlin crisis from the hands of the local military authorities to senior diplomats for handling, and on the other hand warning the Soviet Union that if it insists on its current strategy in Berlin, it will inevitably create serious consequences. If this joint protest is indeed lodged with Moscow, it will inevitably cause a "showdown" between the Soviet Union and Britain, the United States, and France in Germany. British and American commentators unanimously demanded that the government authorities deal with the Soviet Union firmly, and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie is also considering: "Requesting the Security Council to discuss the Berlin crisis." Looking at the trend, if the Soviet Union insists on its own way to the end, it will inevitably cause a serious crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>However, United Press International suddenly reported from Berlin on the 29th that the Soviet Union has partially lifted the ban on transportation between East and West Germany, and the Berlin crisis has suddenly eased, which seems to give the world, which has been holding its breath waiting for the continued development of the Berlin situation, a chance to breathe. However, other news followed, and that is the "Tito incident," which shifted the world's attention, along with the shifting focus of the Cold War between East and West, from Berlin to Belgrade. Although it is too early to tell the outbreak of the "Tito incident" and its future outcome, in any case, it can be regarded as two rounds in the Cold War between East and West, along with the "Czech coup" in February and March of this year. If the Czech coup can be said to be a victory for the East, then this Tito incident can be said to be the beginning of the breakup of the Eastern European bloc.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia was originally the strongest link in the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc, but after the "Tito incident" occurred, Yugoslavia has become a weak point in the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc. Moreover, the Yugoslav Communist Party has already made a solemn statement, in addition to refuting the Cominform's accusations against Marshal Tito, and calling for unity within the party to unanimously support Marshal Tito. Although this incident cannot be said to be a victory for the West, it has given the world a valuable revelation, that is, the ideology of the Comintern cannot ultimately coexist with the concept of nation-state. Even if they are misled for a while and go astray, they will ultimately not be able to extinguish the existence of national consciousness. The Yugoslav Communist Party and its leaders have this self-awareness, which is a perfect proof. In short, the Tito incident can be said to be a disturbance within the Iron Curtain, and it can also be said to be the beginning of the breakup of the Eastern European bloc. In today's increasingly fierce Cold War between East and West, its significance is naturally particularly profound, but whether future developments can reverse the current European situation depends on how American diplomacy uses it.</p>
<h3>Plan to Popularize National Education to Be Implemented Next Year; Minister of Education Zhu Reports on Administration in Legislative Yuan Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 30th, inviting Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua to attend and report on education administration. Zhu first admitted that education had suffered great losses from the War of Resistance to the Suppression of Rebellion, and that educational measures were far from expectations. He then made explanations on the following three points: (1) Balanced development: Zhu pointed out that education at all levels must be balanced and coordinated. Among universities, all subjects should also be balanced. In middle schools, the balanced development of middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools should be sought, without undue emphasis on one over the others. The distribution of schools should also pay attention to the interior and border areas. (2) Actively promoting basic education: Since the 21st year of the Republic [1932], some provinces and cities have achieved one school per pao [unit of local administration]. Last year, the Ministry of Education, in accordance with constitutional laws and regulations, universally established six-year primary schools nationwide, and plans to start implementing the plan to popularize national education from next year, hoping to complete the popularization of basic education within ten years. In addition, efforts will also be made to adult literacy education and strengthen research on basic education. (3) Handling special problems: With the turbulent situation and abnormal society, if there are violations of the spirit of the founding of the country, the spread of poisons, or even actions planned by the Communist Party to harm the country and the nation in schools, they must be prevented in advance. Young students who have escaped from bandit areas will be resettled as much as possible, and graduates will be assisted in finding employment as much as possible. Zhu concluded by saying that education is a normal task, and facilities have continuity. All parties are calling for revitalizing education, which is also what we are praying for. At present, education emphasizes both quality and quantity. In the future, we will focus on cultivating teachers, enriching equipment, and revising curricula to make school education meet the actual needs of the country and society. This is our responsibility, and we will intensify our efforts, especially hoping for cooperation from all parties.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education on Student Protests</h3>
<p>Not Intending to Shirk Administrative Responsibility</p>
<p>After the report, more than ten people including Chen Jintang and Li Yu raised questions one after another, successively raising questions on education funding, responsibility for student protests, and the facilities and development of public and private school education. Finally, Zhu answered, briefly stating: A. Education funding has already accounted for 15% of the total amount in the ordinary department of the national general budget in accordance with the constitution. B. Although the reasons for student protests include political factors and disturbances by professional students, the Ministry of Education does not intend to shirk administrative responsibility, and will continue to carefully select responsible persons for each school and improve the organization in the future. C. After private schools are established, we will reward and supervise them heavily, and will continue to strengthen supervision and urge them to improve teachers and equipment in the future. D. The distribution of schools will no longer be concentrated in cities, and national schools will strive for universal development. E. Education laws and regulations are currently being sorted out. Regarding the unemployment problem, we will gradually try to prevent it through education. F. He sympathized with the movement to restore Dada at Beijing Normal University and hoped that the school could restore its past glory. However, at present, due to the provisions of the University Law, he is powerless. In addition to providing as much assistance as possible to the school in terms of equipment, the Ministry of Education will provide reasonable remedies when revising the regulations. He said that last winter, he did not agree that the school could restore Dada within one year. Even if there were similar statements, the one-year period has not yet expired, and the students of the school should not use student protests to coerce. In addition, according to the report of Yao Congwu, president of Henan University, only four students of the school were killed by stray bullets in the Battle of Bian Tang, which was by no means as serious as the general rumors.</p>
<h3>Peiping Christian Students Pray for Peace</h3>
<p>July Designated as Month of Prayer for Peace</p>
<p>[United Press International, Peiping, 30th] About 100 Christian students in Peiping launched a prayer for peace movement today, hoping to accelerate the end of the civil war. The students sent a circular to Christians across the country, asking them to join this movement and designated July as "Month of Prayer for Peace."</p>
<h3>Wuxi Monitors Gauze Market; Chongqing Resumes Cotton Yarn Trading</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 30th] Recently, prices have soared, especially cotton yarn. According to the Wuxi Office of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the office has been ordered to jointly monitor the gauze market with the county government from today to prevent speculation and hoarding. Also, 789 pieces of cotton yarn stored in the Qinyi warehouse are also being investigated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 30th] The Social Affairs Bureau resumed cotton yarn trading today and stipulated: (1) Yarn factories should supply as much of their daily production as possible to the market. (2) Yarn factories should report the price to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval once every five days based on cost. Yarn merchants should add a profit of 5% to the factory price. (3) Every three yarn merchants should jointly guarantee each other to trade in accordance with the stipulated prices. Violators will have their licenses revoked for all three merchants at the same time.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Price Suppression Meeting Decides to Sanction Black Market for Gold and Currency</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 30th] In view of the recent skyrocketing prices, the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters convened a meeting of relevant agencies yesterday to suppress prices, deciding to implement strict sanctions against the black market for gold and currency and to ban hoarding and speculation starting in July.</p>
<h3>Hefei Prices Slightly Rebound; Rice Market Often Reports No Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 30th] Prices have generally rebounded slightly. Gold is being sold for 230 million and bought for 210 million. 20-count foreign yarn is 560 million. Cigarettes have also fallen in price. Due to the bank's mid-year settlement period, the money supply is extremely tight, and very few transactions are being made for various items. However, since the rice price evaluation committee has been evaluating rice prices daily, the market often reports no goods. The current evaluated price is 17 million for early-maturing rice, while the black market price is 22 million, and it is still difficult to buy. The common people are crying out in pain.</p>
<h3>Beiping and Tianjin Purchase Grain from Chahar and Suiyuan; Suspension of Paying 40% Military Grain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 30th] The grain problem in Beiping and Tianjin is expected to improve. Fu Zuoyi has decided to suspend the method of requiring those who purchase grain in Chahar and Suiyuan to pay 40% of the purchase as military grain at the official price. Chahar and Suiyuan are expected to have a bumper harvest this year, and merchants can freely go there to purchase grain afterwards.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 30th] Tianjin has been selling grain for three days, and the number of applicants to purchase is increasing daily. The selling price is determined by Xia Jinxiong, director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and Li Lixia, director of the Auditing Office, who personally go to the market to approve it. The average price of flour has fallen by 300,000 per bag compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Assumes Office as Chairman of Zhejiang; Says He Attaches Importance to Governance and Production; Provincial Government Meeting Convened Today to Announce Personnel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th] Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi arrived in Hangzhou at 11:55 this morning on the West Lake train to take office. The entire city of Hangzhou hung flags to celebrate. The new and outgoing department heads of the provincial government, the heads of various agencies in the provincial capital, representatives of people's organizations, leaders from all walks of life, and Chen's friends, totaling more than a thousand people, gathered at the city station to welcome him. After getting off the train, Chen went to the foreign guests' reception center and told our newspaper reporter: "I have not returned to my hometown for more than 20 years. This time, I am honored to be in charge of the provincial government in Zhejiang, and I will attach importance to security and production. The financial revenue and expenditure can barely be sustained. How to further increase revenue and reduce expenditure will be discussed and decided with relevant parties. Zhejiang Province does not have abundant resources. If we use hydropower to generate electricity, it will benefit agriculture and industry a lot. Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is open, if we build a railway in Jinhua and Wenzhou and open up navigation on the Qiantang River, the economic situation in Zhejiang Province will definitely improve. However, to achieve this goal, we must requisition idle manpower and funds and gradually develop. As for personnel matters after I take office, I do not intend to make many changes."</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Chairman Chen took office at 4:00 p.m. today without holding a ceremony. He only transferred the office with Lei Fazhang, the representative of former Chairman Shen, in the provincial government meeting room. The new and outgoing department heads and heads of various agencies all participated. First, Lei gave a welcoming speech and recounted Shen's ambitions and achievements during his 27 months in charge of Zhejiang. He then stated that Shen had said before his departure that Chen had greater talents, and that he would surely make greater achievements when he returned to Zhejiang to take charge of the government, which was truly a blessing for the people of Zhejiang. Chen said that Shen had made successive achievements in Zhejiang, and that he would order his subordinates to work together for the stability and prosperity of Zhejiang with a spirit of fairness, courage, unity, and consistency. Subsequently, the new and outgoing civil affairs directors, Du Wei and Ruan Yicheng, held a handover in the Civil Affairs Department. Ruan had been in charge of civil affairs in Zhejiang for ten years and had achieved remarkable results. Du had served as the head of the Zhejiang East Administrative Office and was also well-respected. As for the Education and Construction Departments, the handover will be held tomorrow.

<h3>Allied Headquarters Approves Our Request to Return Property Plundered by Japan; Total Value of More Than 5.1 Million U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] According to Wu Bannong, head of our country's compensation and restitution delegation, two months after the establishment of the Allied Headquarters Restitution Advisory Committee, it has approved our request to return all of our country's property looted by Japan, with a total value of approximately 5,156,000 U.S. dollars. Wu praised the cooperative spirit of the Allied Headquarters restitution authorities. Wu continued: In terms of restitution work, our overseas Chinese in Japan have constantly provided our delegation in Japan with valuable information. Among the returned materials, such as sheepskins and raw silk, there are not many overseas Chinese in our country who are willing to purchase them. He personally believes that it is better to sell the above-mentioned returned goods locally. This can save transportation costs and obtain foreign exchange for the domestic government, which lacks U.S. dollars, and is more convenient.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Changsha, 30th] With skyrocketing prices, public educators and staff are in dire straits.

On the morning of the 28th, over two hundred people signed a "Salary Demand Petition," intending to petition Chairman Wang. Upon learning of this, Chairman Wang decided during the provincial administration review meeting in the morning to advance half a month's salary for July, based on double the June amount, with a deadline of two days for collection. Although the employees did not achieve their demand for the full month's salary, they were able to understand the difficult circumstances due to the emptiness of the provincial treasury and the ongoing reorganization period, so the salary demand action was called off.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Situation and Pan-Pacific Policy</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>If the United States' position in the Far East and its long-term policy are observed from the focal point of Japan, a clear and obvious outline can be seen. My conversations with some of the highest-ranking personnel in Tokyo have further strengthened my impression that the Pacific region is indeed an indivisible whole, both diplomatically and militarily. The entire situation in the Far East does not entirely depend on raising Japan's production level to effectively deter communism, or how quickly the situation in China can stabilize, or whether the United States can build the scattered Pacific islands into impregnable bastions. In the author's personal opinion, victory in the Cold War in the Pacific region can only be achieved under one condition: that China, Japan, Korea, and other strategic areas can be interconnected under a coordinated policy, act in concert, and each component use its own economic, political, and military weight to seek the overall interest.</p>
<p>This analysis of the Far East strategy may seem like a truism, but the author must state that before going to Japan for on-the-ground investigation, the urgent need for this Pan-Pacific policy was not felt as deeply as it is today. As far as Japan is concerned, although the Allies are currently supporting its economy to prevent it from being taken over by communism, if China is ever drawn into the orbit of communism (and this possibility is by no means merely imaginary), Japan will immediately become an indefensible outpost, which the United States' money and precautions will not be able to salvage. As for Korea's position, the U.S. military will eventually withdraw, and when that day comes, Korea will either fall entirely into the hands of the communists or become a battlefield for two conflicting ideologies. Under these circumstances, external pressure on Japan is bound to increase, and the three islands will once again become a dangerous forward base, which will not be easy to defend for long unless there is another stable, strong, and friendly mainland country providing lateral cover and support. Therefore, analyzing the entire strategic situation in the Far East, it is not difficult to see that China is in a key position. Our country's situation is currently chaotic, and perhaps some people are unwilling to admit this, but it is indeed the case. Therefore, after assessing the situation in the Far East, the simple conclusion is that when China is swallowed by communist forces, the entire Far East will become Moscow's private property.</p>
<p>I deeply feel that if the United States cannot summarize the entire situation in the Far East and the potential strength of each region, and determine a general course of action, then improving the Japanese economy will be an expensive and ineffective undertaking. Unless there is a stable China as a force for stability in the Far East, Japan will eventually fall to communism.</p>
<p>After investigating the actual situation in Japan, I deeply feel that despite the assiduous efforts of the Allied Headquarters, Japanese thought is rapidly turning left, although its political direction is moving to the right. The leftward tilt of the Japanese intelligentsia, lower classes, and masses is mainly due to the physical reaction. For many years, Japanese thought was confined to the small circle of the right wing. Only after the defeat of the militarists did they gain liberation. Now everyone wants to explore left-leaning political theories. A surge of striving for freedom has pushed them closer to the edge of communism. The second reason for the leftward tilt is the reaction of the Japanese people to the seemingly hopeless economic situation. The middle and lower classes of Japan already lived poorly in the past when Japan was strong, and now they are even closer to the starvation line. Desperate poverty is a disease that drives people to the equally deadly communism. The third reason is that some people in Japan today still hope that Japan can rise again, believing that there may be greater freedom under Soviet rule. Therefore, in Japan, as in China, the number of "rice bowl communists" is increasing rapidly. This kind of thinking of the Japanese is also pushing the general thinking of the Japanese people to the extreme left. However, before the establishment of a communist regime in China, the chances of a long-term victory for communism in Japan are small. On the other hand, from the standpoint of international anti-communism, unless the momentum of the Communist Party in China can be suppressed, anti-communist efforts in Japan and the entire Pacific region will not succeed.</p>
<p>This analysis leads me to one conclusion: that the United States' Far East policy currently has a microcosm in Japan, and sooner or later it will follow a parallel course toward China and Japan. This development is not yet obvious and is deliberately obscured for political reasons, but the final formation of this policy is unavoidable. The question now is not whether this development is possible, but when this policy can be clarified and become a powerful decision, to be implemented with a series of bold and well-designed actions. Talking about a "Pan-Pacific Union" and a plan for mutual cooperation in politics, economy, national defense, and diplomacy seems premature. I heard this plan when I was in Tokyo, but when I asked MacArthur to comment on it, he refused to comment.</p>
<p>I feel that the Pan-Pacific Union may not take any form, but as days go by, some actions and arrangements will gradually be implemented. The current situation in Japan and the policies of the United States both point in this direction, and unless such measures can be taken, the United States' overall plan in Japan will not be successful.</p>

<h3>Comintern's Indictments Refuted Point by Point by Yugoslav Communists; Calls for Party Members to Unite and Support the Current Government</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Belgrade, 29th] The Communist Party of Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, on the 29th, in effect rejected the Comintern's accusations against Yugoslavia's rights and directly appealed to Moscow to defend its policies. Shortly after the announcement of this rejection in Yugoslavia, Tito was seen returning to the capital from his summer villa. According to witnesses at the airport, when Marshal Tito emerged from the plane, his face did not show anxiety, presumably Marshal Tito personally bears the responsibility for this situation. In addition, the committee directly appealed to the Yugoslav Communists to support Tito and his regime. This situation has formed an open break between Tito and the Comintern, but on the one hand, Tito reaffirmed his loyalty to the Soviet government and the Eastern European communist front governments.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 29th] The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party has issued a statement rejecting the Comintern's criticism of the Yugoslav Communists in the strongest possible terms. All national radio stations in Yugoslavia broadcast this statement. It first pointed out that the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party sent a letter to the countries of the Comintern on March 27, strongly accusing the Yugoslav Communists. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party did not send this letter to Yugoslavia, which is also a member of the Comintern, nor did it notify Yugoslavia of this matter. Soon after, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, reiterating the points of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party accusing the Yugoslav Communists. Copies of the letter were sent to all other members of the Comintern except the French and Italian Communist Parties. The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party believes that the members of the Comintern have accepted the accusations of the Soviet Communist Party against the Yugoslav Communists before allowing the Yugoslav Communists to speak out. Subsequently, the Soviet Communist Party sent letters to the Yugoslav Communist Party three times in April and May, reiterating the previous accusations. The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party solemnly declares that all accusations of the Comintern against the Yugoslav Communists are fabricated slander. What is even more surprising is that the Yugoslav Communist Party has repeatedly sent letters suggesting that on-the-spot investigations of the accusations be carried out in Yugoslavia to clarify the truth, but these have been rejected by the Soviet Communist Party. The Yugoslav Communist Party solemnly rejects the accusations that the party protects landlords and punishes party members in an overly harsh manner. Accusing the party of not allowing others to criticize is the most shameful and terrifying insult to the party. As for the fact that elections have not been held in the afternoon, this is also due to wartime and post-war conditions. After refuting the accusations of the Comintern point by point, the statement of the Yugoslav Communist Party stated that the Central Committee now requests all comrades of the Yugoslav Communist Party to consolidate their unity and support the government as the only response to these accusations.</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Communists Call Again for Union with Bulgaria and Albania; To Organize a Balkan Federation; The Main Reason for the Rift Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, 30th, broadcast: The division between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is even more acute today. Tito today again appealed to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania to form an alliance, but the Soviet Union had already expressed its opposition to this alliance. According to the British Foreign Office, the split between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is because Tito refused to accept orders from the Kremlin. Also, it is reported that the headquarters of the Comintern has decided to move from the capital of Yugoslavia to the Hungarian capital.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 30th] The Yugoslav Communist Party's newspaper "Borba" stated for the first time that the main reason for the rift between the Soviet Communist Party and the Yugoslav Communist Party is that the main goal of Yugoslav foreign policy is to organize a federation of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania as a geographical unit within the Eastern European axis. This plan was opposed by some members of the Soviet Communist Party, who believed that it would weaken the strength of the Eastern European bloc. These opinions are actually wrong. Organizing a federation with Bulgaria and Albania can only promote the unity of Southeast Europe and is beneficial in all aspects. The Yugoslav Communist Party will consistently strive to strengthen and develop cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The Yugoslav Communist Party will never deviate from its current and past foreign policy. Although the Yugoslav Communist Party is dissatisfied with the wording of the Comintern's declaration, it will not allow it to cast a shadow on the current friendly relations between Eastern European countries. The Yugoslav Communist Party believes that this dispute is just a family internal dispute and not an irreconcilable conflict.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned statement by "Borba" is included in the outline of the Yugoslav Communist Party's plan to be discussed by the 5th Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party next week. The outline states that the independence of the Yugoslav nation and country is a prerequisite for moving towards socialism and its general progress. That is, "Borba" resolutely states that its purpose is to enable the Yugoslav state and the Communist Party to consistently resist the imperialists' conspiracy to enslave the socialist motherland of the Yugoslav nation. The Yugoslav Communist Party will strive for political and spiritual unity within the borders of Yugoslavia and the closest possible cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, especially when establishing conditions so that the Bulgarian and Albanian nations can unite with the Yugoslav nation on an equal basis. The Yugoslav Communist Party advocates close cooperation between the People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the anti-imperialist democratic forces led by the Soviet Union to fight against anti-democratic imperialist forces and defeat them. The Yugoslav Communist Party will support all countries and movements that strive for peace and oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and advocates that all countries should engage in peace-loving cooperation based on the principles of the United Nations. The Yugoslav Communist Party will also provide moral and political assistance to the labor, democratic, and national liberation movements, as well as the nations fighting for freedom, democracy, and social justice. (Judging from the last section, it is almost entirely referring to the guerrilla activities in Greece).</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Will Not Allow Yugoslavia to Become a Buffer State</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The most well-informed neutral observers here believe that if Tito and other Yugoslav Communist leaders can admit the mistakes in their policies and correct them, they can still return to the ranks of the Comintern. The eight members of the Comintern believe that the attempt of the Yugoslav Communist leaders to make Yugoslavia a buffer state between the two major camps of the United States and the Soviet Union is clearly incompatible with the Comintern's basic position. The importance that the Soviet Communist Party attaches to this matter can be seen from the fact that the three giants of the Soviet Communist Party, Zhdanov, Malenkov, and Suslov, personally participated in this Comintern's meeting.</p>
<h3>Heavy Gunfire Heard Near Yugoslav Border with Greece</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] A report from Rome radio citing news from the Greek-Yugoslav border stated that fighting has already broken out in Yugoslav territory north of Florina, near the Greek border. A battalion of Yugoslav troops crossed the border into Greece to take refuge. Heavy machine-gun fire was heard from the other side of the Greek-Yugoslav border. Greek army intelligence personnel said that Yugoslav troops have three divisions stationed on the Greek-Yugoslav border.</p>
<h3>Impressions of People in Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Believe That Tito Will Eventually Submit to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 30th] Experts in Czechoslovakia who are familiar with international communist policy believe that Tito and the leaders of the Yugoslav Communists, who have been expelled by the Comintern, have no other way to go than to change the policies of the Yugoslav Communist Party to meet the requirements of the Comintern. Because, apart from the countries of the Comintern, Tito may be hoping to obtain the support of other countries, but the so-called bourgeois and capitalist countries are unlikely to support a regime that is denounced by orthodox communism as being overly totalitarian and overly left-leaning. The factors that are unfavorable to Tito, in addition to the pressure from the Comintern, also include the strength of the so-called loyal comrades within the Yugoslav Communist Party, the economic pressure from the Slavic bloc countries, and the moral, political, economic, and ideological strength of the Soviet Union. Therefore, people in the Czech Communist Party believe that if Tito continues to implement his overly totalitarian policies, even if he can obtain the support of the military, it will be difficult for him to maintain his position under the consistent attack of communist parties at home and abroad. Only by seeking a compromise with party members at home and abroad can he preserve his power and reputation.</p>
<h3>Southern Assets in America to be Unfrozen Next Week</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: It is reported that Yugoslavia will receive thirty million US dollars in war reparations from the United States. This is the first step taken by the US State Department following Yugoslavia's recent split with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Authoritative sources state that the US government may unfreeze Yugoslav assets in the United States, totaling fifty-five million US dollars, as early as next week. Yugoslavia will also compensate US citizens twenty million US dollars for losses suffered due to the nationalization of industries in Yugoslavia, and will provide compensation in Yugoslav currency for the two American aircraft shot down in Yugoslavia in 1947. Authoritative sources revealed that this is the result of talks in Washington and is unrelated to the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslav communists. This indicates that Tito is very willing to improve relations with Western countries.</p>
<h3>Italian Socialist Party Congress to Vote on Future Course</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Genoa, 30th Dispatch] The congress of the majority faction of the Italian Socialist Party, led by Nenni, is today at the stage of voting to decide whether to continue cooperating with the Communist Party or to declare independent action against the Communist Party. Observers pointed out today that the Socialist Party leans heavily to the left, but it is still difficult to predict the outcome of the vote.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary to Deliver Speech, Clarifying Policy on Germany</h3>
<p>Eden Stresses No Concessions to the Soviets</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] It is understood that the Foreign Secretary, Eden, will deliver a statement on Germany in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 30th, which is expected to condemn the Soviet Union's attitude in strong terms and may announce the basic decisions for the future of West Germany.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: Eden, speaking in the British House of Commons today, stated that the Berlin incident was a provocation by the Soviet Union against the Allies. Britain, the United States, and France must not give in, otherwise, they would fail to get Italy and Scandinavia to join the Western European alliance, and would embolden the Communist parties in France and Italy.</p>
<h3>Marshall Indicates US Troops Determined to Remain in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: Marshall issued a statement today stating that the United States is determined to continue its presence in Berlin and will not be swayed by the Soviet blockade. Marshall also stated that the US will use the maximum number of aircraft to transport food to Berlin to support the population.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Occupying Berlin Raise Barrier Balloons</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 30th Dispatch] The US Air Force reported today that barrier balloons have been raised over the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, and US pilots have been warned not to fly over the balloons. It is generally feared that the Soviet forces will take new blockade measures against the Berlin airlift route.</p>
<h3>US Delegation to Visit China and Japan to Investigate Various Trust Territories; Security Council Debates Control of Trust Territories</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] A US Congressional delegation, researching American interests in the Pacific, announced on the 29th that the delegation will also visit China and Japan. According to Gordon, chairman of the delegation, representatives of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate want to study the strategic and international status of the various islands in the Pacific held by the United States, and to study the general relations of these islands with the countries of the Far East, especially with China and Japan. Therefore, the delegation decided to visit China and Japan. They are scheduled to depart on November 9th. Republican Congressman Crawford was elected vice-chairman of the delegation, and Republican Congressman Fulton was elected secretary.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 29th Dispatch from United Press] Which part of the United Nations Organization has the authority to control "strategic trust territories" is the subject of debate between the Chinese, Soviet, and Philippine representatives in the Trusteeship Council. The Soviet representative believes that the United Nations Charter only authorizes the Security Council to be responsible for all aspects of strategic trust territories. The Philippine representative called this a misunderstanding of the Charter, arguing that the Trusteeship Council has significant control rights. The Chinese representative, Liu, agreed that the Security Council must take action, believing that the Trusteeship Council therefore has some control rights.</p>
<h3>Important US-British-French Conference to Formulate West German Government Plan and Seek Early Resolution to the Berlin Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 30th Dispatch] An important British-American-French conference, expected to produce the final plan for the establishment of a West German government, opened today in Frankfurt. The US delegation is led by the US military governor, with representatives including Lucius D. Clay, Wedemeyer, Chief of the Army's Strategy Department, General Howley, US Commander in Berlin, and Harriman, Inspector of the European Recovery Program.</p>
<p>The British delegation includes Sir Robertson, British military governor; Kirkbride, advisor to the British Foreign Office on German affairs; Herbert, deputy British military governor; and Major General Brownjohn, British commander in Berlin. The French delegation is led by General Koenig, French military governor, with a total of ten representatives. Robertson, after arriving from Berlin this morning, said at the airport that he would work with the US and France to provide the West German government with a formal foundation. Clay also told reporters that the conference would have concrete results and would not be limited to empty words. Robertson also told reporters before the meeting that he did not attach importance to the Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky's statement that he hoped the railway between Berlin and West Germany could be repaired to restore freight transport before the food reserves in the western districts of Berlin were exhausted. He said that Sokolovsky's words seemed pleasing to the ear, but had no practical significance. In short, what the Western countries demand is action, not empty words.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 29th Dispatch] A dispatch from Washington states that the State Department announced that efforts to resolve the Berlin crisis will first be negotiated in Berlin by the military governors. If this fails, other steps will be taken directly towards Moscow. It is reported that Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky, in his reply to British Commander-in-Chief Robertson, has expressed his hope that the repair of the Berlin-Helmstedt railway can be completed and freight transport restored before Berlin's food reserves are used up.</p>
<h3>Soviet Pressure on Berlin Aims to Force Peace Treaty with Germany</h3>
<p>Wallace Comments on the Berlin Situation</p>
<p>[United Press, Portland, Maine, 29th Dispatch] Wallace said today that the Soviet Union's increased pressure on Berlin may be an action to force a peace treaty with Germany. He stated at a press conference that if he were president, he would call for a peace conference on Germany to resolve the current Berlin situation. He said that the peace conference should draft a treaty that includes the withdrawal of all troops from Germany within one year. He said: "I think Stalin will agree to hold a peace conference. I am not defending the Soviet Union's actions, but I think the Soviet Union's recent actions are preparing to force the signing of a peace treaty with Germany." He criticized the current US foreign policy as having "extreme danger."</p>
<h3>Lie Does Not Intend to Bring the Berlin Incident to the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 29th Dispatch] United Nations Secretary-General Lie issued a statement tonight stating that he does not intend to invoke Article 99 of the Charter at this time to bring the Berlin issue to the Security Council for discussion.

<h3>US Demands Soviet Union Restore Electricity Supply to South Korea</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The State Department announced that the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union presented a note to Molotov on the 26th, demanding that the North Korean authorities immediately restore the electricity supply to South Korea and negotiate payment terms in accordance with the occupation agreement.

<h3>Bernadotte's Holy Land Peace Proposal Expected to be Rejected by the Arab League; Reports Indicate Bernadotte Favors Federal System Supporting a Jewish State</h3>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 29th Dispatch] According to informed sources on the 29th, United Nations mediator Bernadotte's proposed permanent solution for the Holy Land is the establishment of a federal state in Palestine, with the Jewish region placed under United Nations trusteeship. It is said that United Nations trusteeship officials will prevent illegal immigration into Palestine. Bernadotte believes that this will be sufficient to guarantee that Arab countries will not be attacked by "Zionists."</p>
<p>Senior members of the Arab League Political Committee, when mentioning the rumored federal system proposal, stated that if this is Bernadotte's suggestion, it is unlikely to be accepted by the Arab side. There is currently no official report on the content of the proposal. It is reported that Bernadotte's proposal is as long as five pages.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 29th Dispatch] Arab officials here believe that Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposal will inevitably be rejected by the Arabs because it does not satisfy Arab goals. Egyptian newspapers all predict that Bernadotte's peace mission will encounter failure and consider the Arab League Political Committee currently meeting in Cairo to be "the most important meeting since the establishment of the Arab League." Although the content of Bernadotte's proposal has not yet been revealed, sources familiar with the matter revealed that although Bernadotte has made significant concessions to meet Arab conditions, he still firmly supports the establishment of a Jewish state and insists on the principle that the State of Israel must exist in Palestine. As far as the Arab side is concerned, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine is a point that the Arabs absolutely cannot compromise on. Therefore, the failure of Bernadotte's proposal seems inevitable.</p>

Italy and Ireland agreed to comply.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 29th Dispatch] The bilateral British-American agreement, divided into thirteen points, has recently been published here.

<h3>International Labor Conference Discusses Wage Issues</h3>
<p>We Advocate Based on Our Cost of Living Index</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 29th Dispatch] The Chinese delegation attending the 31st session of the International Labor Organization has reached a consensus on the wage issues currently being discussed by the conference committee. It is understood that the Chinese representatives firmly insisted that any proposed wage plan must be based on China's cost of living index, as China actively participates in the activities of the International Labor Organization.

<h3>Seventy-Eight Chinese Hawkers in Manila Expelled</h3>

<h3>Finnish General Election Voting Today; Social Democratic Party Gains Strength</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Helsinki, 30th Dispatch] The Finnish people will vote on July 1st and 2nd to elect members of parliament. The country has recently been calm, which is rare in the past. The anxiety from the first time Stalin suggested a mutual assistance treaty to Finland has now disappeared. The general public believes that Finland has avoided the same fate as Czechoslovakia. It is speculated that the Social Democratic Party is expected to win the most votes in the general election. The People's Democratic League, jointly formed by the Communist Party and the Left Party, will inevitably lose many seats. In the current parliament, the People's Democratic League occupies 51 seats, the Social Democrats 48 seats, the Agrarians 48 seats, the Conservative Coalition 29 seats, the Swedish People's Party, representing the Swedish minority in Finland, 14 seats, the Liberal Progressive Party 9 seats, and the Swedish Liberal Party 1 seat. The Social Democratic Party's position has greatly strengthened since the political crisis in May when the Communist Party demanded to obtain the Minister of Interior's seat, resulting in the Social Democratic Party defeating the Communist Party's plan. The Communist Party claimed that 100,000 workers participated in the coercive strike, but the official announcement stated that only 25,000 workers participated, accounting for only 7.5% of trade union members. The Communist Party has always used strikes as its most powerful weapon. Since this attempt failed, the Communist Party's strength has greatly weakened.</p>
<h3>South Korea May Form Government Before UN General Assembly Meeting</h3>
<p>US Pressing India and France to Recognize Korean Parliament</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Seoul, 30th Dispatch] Reporters learned today from non-official and well-informed sources that active diplomatic activities are underway in Paris and New Delhi, requesting the governments concerned to recognize the Korean Parliament led by Syngman Rhee as the sole representative structure of the Korean people as soon as possible, so that it can organize a nationwide government for Korea. These sources stated that the United States is currently applying diplomatic pressure on India and France, because among the nine representatives of the delegation to Korea, the representatives of France and India still hold a reserved attitude towards the Korean issue. The Korean Parliament will establish a de facto government before the United Nations General Assembly meets in Paris on September 21, because the Korean issue will definitely be discussed at the meeting at that time.</p>

<h3>Senate Assembly Extended for Another Day; A Heated Debate Arose Over the Establishment of a Chinese Medicine Hospital</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The 6th General Assembly of the Municipal Senate was held yesterday for the 6th meeting. It was originally scheduled to expedite the discussion of the remaining approximately 100 proposals so that the meeting could be adjourned as scheduled at 7 PM yesterday. However, as the statutory adjournment time arrived, only half of all the proposals were completed. It was decided to extend the meeting by one hour to conclude. However, when discussing the health group's request to add a municipal Chinese medicine hospital to meet social needs, some senators in the meeting hall were undecided. Finally, it was put to a vote, but the number of senators in the hall was insufficient to meet the legal quorum. The meeting could not continue and it was decided to extend the meeting for another day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting did not begin until about 4 PM. The first items put to a vote were the proposals submitted by the speaker. The discussion of important proposals proceeded as follows: (1) Passed the request to the central government to dispatch a military discipline inspection team to be stationed in Shanghai for a long term to rectify military discipline. (2) To abolish the city's hotel industry's room rate control measures and allow them to be changed to an appraisal system.

(3) To respond to the Qingdao Municipal Assembly, a telegram will be sent to the central government ordering all localities to announce the list of corrupt personnel identified by the investigation teams and to severely punish them.</p>
<p>Suggest Preventing Illegal Arrests</p>
<p>(4) Passed the request that the Assembly suggest to the city's military and police authorities to effectively prevent illegal arrests and abuse of non-judicial punishment by military and police agencies. If the above-mentioned illegal situations are discovered, they should be severely punished to protect human rights. (5) The Municipal Finance Bureau will still collect food business tax on behalf of customers. Passed the transfer to the central government for exemption.</p>
<p>Three Resolutions on Business Tax Case</p>
<p>The main cases in the review case section include: (1) Regarding the case that the city's business tax will still be collected at the adjusted tax rate, three resolutions were passed: (A) Starting in the fall of this year, the new tax rate of 3% will be collected, but the Finance Bureau should implement simplified collection methods at the same time. (B) In the summer of this year, the original tax rate, that is, 1.5%, will still be collected, but the Assembly should send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the industry associations for detailed reporting, and the Finance Bureau should conduct strict random checks to increase tax revenue. (C) The supplementary collection for the spring of this year will be postponed. (2) Passed the letter to the Municipal Government instructing the Police Bureau to abolish the method of requiring households to present national identity cards. (3) When discussing "the case of prohibiting cargo ships from docking at the Bund wharf in the Central District to improve the city's appearance and facilitate traffic," the two attached letters from the Shanghai Jifen Boat Industry Joint Venture to the Public Works Bureau expressed objections to the resolutions of the 5th General Assembly of the Senate, believing that they "put the cart before the horse," "lacked municipal common sense, and were truly despicable," and "did not understand the situation and made reckless criticisms," which aroused the aversion of some senators, who believed that it was a public insult to the Senate and caused a heated debate. Finally, two resolutions were passed: (A) The two attached letters will be returned to the Municipal Government, (B) The case will be submitted for re-examination.</p>
<p>Public Works Proposals Passed Smoothly</p>
<p>A total of 21 cases were in the public works section. However, the discussion process was the most smooth, and most of them were passed according to the original review opinions. The following is a summary of several cases: (1) Street names should not be changed lightly. Please refer to the Municipal Government.

(7) Please the Municipal Government promptly allocate funds to build the north-south trunk road in the Longhua District. (8) Please the Municipal Government promptly formulate restrictions on the reconstruction of houses to prevent owners from using reconstruction permits to force tenants to move out for profit, increase the housing shortage, and affect public security.</p>
<p>Clearing Vacant Land, Planning to Build Houses</p>
<p>There were eight cases in the land administration section, and the process was also smooth. The important ones include: (1) Please the Land Administration Bureau to actively consider establishing a housing construction committee, clearing vacant public and private land in various districts of the city, and formulating an entire plan to build houses, which will be rented or sold separately to solve the housing shortage problem. (2) Please the Municipal Government and all central government-affiliated agencies to strictly prohibit using large amounts of key money to secure housing, which promotes the practice of key money. (3) Please the Municipal Government thoroughly investigate the public land and houses in the former French Concession that have not been handed over and promptly recover them to maintain public property.</p>
<p>Finding Ways to Place Graduates</p>
<p>There were a total of ten cases in the education section. The important cases passed include: (1) In order to increase the enrollment of out-of-school children, it is proposed to expand the municipal national primary school buildings. (2) The construction of the city's three museums, libraries, museums, and art galleries has been resolved in terms of location and funding.

(4) Please the Municipal Government to approve the change of the second division of the Municipal Yangjing Middle School into an independent junior middle school. Although there was a slight debate, it was still passed according to the review opinions and sent to the Municipal Government for reference.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Hospital Case Cannot Be Voted On</p>
<p>Just after the discussion of the education section was completed, the scheduled adjournment time arrived. After the chairman consulted the opinions of the senators present, the meeting was extended by one hour, and the eight cases in the health section were submitted for discussion. After one reading, the sixth case, "Please add a municipal Chinese medicine hospital to meet social needs," was submitted. Because the case involved a great deal, the hall found that some senators had propaganda materials for and against the case in advance. As soon as it was raised, opinions were divided. Some advocated immediate passage, some advocated reservation, and some advocated resubmission for review. Finally, all advocated putting it to a vote, but the number of senators present was insufficient to meet the legal quorum, so it was necessary to temporarily announce the adjournment of the meeting and schedule it to continue for another day today (the 1st).</p>
<h3>Ma Junshuo and Others Propose Preventing Increased Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>Also, among the temporary proposals to be voted on today, there is a case proposed by Ma Junshuo and others: "After a house is burned down, the owner should guarantee the rights of the original tenant when rebuilding or not considering rebuilding, so as to prevent the owner from taking the opportunity to recover the house and avoid increasing the housing shortage." According to Article 14 of the Rental Ordinance, "If a house is rebuilt and still rented out, the original tenant has the priority to rent it," which is a help to relieve disaster victims and relieve the housing shortage, and will also be submitted for discussion.</p>

<h3>Tragedy at Shanghai Military Camp: Nine Men and Women Burned to Death; Front Door Blocked by Fire, Back Door Locked and Nailed Shut; No Way to Escape, Only Cries Heard</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Geng Dongsheng, a Cantonese landlord renting out rooms at No. 44 Xinming Lane, Miaohiao Road, Nanshi, ran a small-scale handicraft factory manufacturing lacquered cloth at the same address. At approximately 9:50 PM last night, while night work was in progress, a spark suddenly ignited the raw materials. These materials consisted of turpentine, alcohol, "commander" spirit, and waste film, causing the flames to erupt immediately and spread fiercely. Upon receiving the news, fire brigades from the Southeast, Northwest, and Northeast districts of Nanshi, as well as the Xinkaihe fire station, rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire. At the same time, after receiving a report from the Shanghai Military Camp police station, Wu Kexiao, the chief of the Penglai police sub-bureau, personally led section chief Li Dazhi, staff member Lu Jihong, and police officers Li Xianwen, Luo Siwei, and Zhu Genfu to the fire scene to maintain order and investigate the cause of the fire. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the shikumen building at No. 44, the fire also spread to the neighboring houses at No. 43 and No. 45. It was discovered that the back door of No. 44 was usually locked and nailed shut, leaving the occupants with no way to escape after the fire broke out. As a result, nine men, women, and children tragically perished in the fire, including landlord Geng Dongsheng (54 years old), his wife Geng Rongying (54 years old), their son Jinquan (27 years old), their daughter-in-law Shen Amei (27 years old), their niece Qin Liuqing (22 years old), and their granddaughter Lifen (1 year old).

Nearby residents heard cries for help at the time, but there was no way to enter and rescue them. Firefighters were still digging through the debris for bodies until approximately 2 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Salary Increase Negotiations Break Down at Ten Major Department Stores; Management Temporarily Rejects Demands; Report Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau Requesting Mediation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A serious dispute has arisen between labor and management at ten department stores in the city, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lane Crawford, Lane Shih, China Emporium, Chung Hwa, Hua Hsin, and Taisun, over the issue of salary increases. The underlying cause of the dispute dates back to the end of last year, when the labor side put forward two demands: (1) implement year-end salary increases, increasing the base salary by one yuan per year; (2) a universal base salary increase of ten yuan per employee. The management, citing poor business conditions, was unable to agree. Subsequently, through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau, both sides agreed to postpone the salary increase proposal for further discussion in six months. On the day before yesterday (June 29), the six-month period expired, and representatives from both labor and management reopened negotiations on the sixth floor of the Wing On department store. The atmosphere of the meeting was very harmonious, and the management expressed great sympathy for the low incomes and difficult living conditions of the employees. Regarding the salary increase issue, it was agreed to continue the meeting at the same location at 4 PM on June 30. Yesterday was the end of the month, when the municipal government announced the cost-of-living index. After the management learned that the index for employees was 560,000 times higher, they refused to accept the principle of a salary increase during the afternoon meeting, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. After the labor representatives brought this news to the various companies, the employees became quite agitated and expressed their dissatisfaction. According to the person in charge of the union, the average base salary of the employees of the ten companies is about 50 yuan. Even calculated according to the 560,000 times index, the monthly income is only 28 million to 30 million yuan. Even if the management fully agrees to the labor's demands, increasing each person's salary by 5.6 million yuan, the total monthly salary would still be only a little over 30 million yuan, which is only enough to cover half a month's expenses for a family of four. Moreover, this case has been dragging on for half a year, and it is believed that the management's abrupt rejection will greatly antagonize the labor side. Both sides have now reported the breakdown of negotiations to the Social Affairs Bureau and requested mediation.</p>
<p>Another report states that although the workers and management of the shops in the Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, and Linsen Road districts of the Chinese and foreign department store industry did not have representatives participating in the negotiations, the employee treatment in the Chinese and foreign department store industry has always followed the lead of the Universal Department Store industry (i.e., the aforementioned ten companies). Therefore, yesterday, both sides quickly contacted the labor and management authorities of the Universal Department Store industry and will take the same steps, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ballroom Tea Charge: 1.2 Million Yuan Per Cup</h3>
<p>The musicians of the city's ballrooms, due to the recent soaring prices, are unable to make a living. Therefore, they recently submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to forward to the management a demand for a 150-fold salary increase. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that musicians are independent professionals and can directly negotiate with the management. It has been learned that after representatives were elected to discuss with the management, the management has agreed to make adjustments. According to another report: Starting today, the tea charge in ballrooms will also be doubled to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Western Film Distributors Suspend Supply of New Films; Cinema Industry Believes It Is Illegal</h3>
<p>Losses Will Be Claimed for Compensation</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the city's nine Western film distributors decided to suspend the supply of new films to cinemas, the cinema industry association convened a special meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. During the meeting, it was unanimously agreed that the restriction of cinema ticket prices is based on the laws and regulations of our government, and Western film distributors should not blame the cinemas for their failure to achieve satisfactory adjustments. The sole reason for the Western film distributors' suspension of the supply of new films is based on the "force majeure" clause in the contract, but government laws and regulations are not natural disasters or man-made calamities and cannot be considered "force majeure" at all. Moreover, the contract agreed upon by both the cinemas and the distributors did not make any rigid provisions on ticket prices, and the distributors should not unilaterally use the suspension of the supply of new films as a means of coercing price increases. Therefore, the result was a resolution to regard the actions of the Western film distributors as illegal acts, and during the period of their suspension of the supply of new films, the cinemas reserve the right to claim compensation for the losses incurred. The association has sent the minutes of the resolution to the Western film distributors yesterday.</p>

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shui Xiangyun, Zhang Zhusan from the General Labor Union, Yan Esheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shao Yongsheng from the Municipal Council, and Tian Heqing from the Industrial Association attended.

Items with increases between 150% and 160% included soap. Items with increases between 160% and 170% included tweed and cigarettes. Items with increases of 200% or more included salted fish, green vegetables, and firewood. According to the price increases this month, public utilities had the smallest increases, while clothing had the most drastic increases. Finally, the committee discussed the cost of living index for the city in June. After careful review, it was decided that the index for workers would be 710,000 times, an increase of 373,000 times compared to the previous month, and the index for employees would be 560,000 times, an increase of 275,000 times compared to the previous month. The committee members were satisfied, signed the index forms, and the municipal government formally announced the results.</p>
<p>General Labor Union Requests Improvements in Compilation; Authorities Adopted All</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, made the following remarks to a Dagong News reporter regarding the workers' cost of living index: Recently, unions in the cotton spinning, printing, cigarette, and water and electricity installation industries have submitted requests to improve the compilation of the index and conduct a new household survey. The General Labor Union, recognizing that the increase in the index is not keeping pace with prices, affecting the lives of ordinary workers, recently submitted several requests to the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) The index should be published every half month; (2) The price of coal briquettes should be calculated at the market price, not the rationed price; (3) A new household survey should be conducted; (4) Due to the drastic price increases in the latter half of June, another price survey should be conducted and included in the total index for June. Of the above four items, except for the third item, the household survey, which requires a cost of over 1 billion yuan and a duration of one and a half years, is still under consideration. The remaining items (1), (2), and (4) have all been adopted by the authorities, demonstrating the government's concern for the livelihood of workers. Regarding the details of this process, the General Labor Union has scheduled a meeting of the executive committee at 2 PM today to present a report. Although the General Labor Union does not send personnel to participate in the compilation of the cost of living index, union representatives attend the review at the end of each month. The June index has been reviewed and is consistent with the prices surveyed by the General Labor Union. At a time when prices and the index are spiraling upwards, it is difficult for industry and commerce to maintain operations. Only mutual understanding between labor and management can help overcome the difficulties. The General Labor Union will safeguard the legitimate interests of workers and hopes that workers will work with peace of mind and strive for production.</p>
<p>Convening a Forum for Various Unions</p>
<p>The General Labor Union has scheduled a forum for the heads of various unions in the coming days to report on the progress of the request to the government to improve the compilation of the index. At the same time, labor representatives to the Municipal Council will report on the discussions regarding labor issues in the current session of the Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Stepmother Loses Her Mind After Marriage, Bizarre Cause of Death; Father, Daughter, and Another Person Prosecuted on Suspicion of Assisting Suicide</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Ren Guae, a woman from Yu Hang, previously married Ruan Bingfa, a worker at Shanghai No. 15 Textile Mill, as his second wife. Unexpectedly, after the marriage, she became delusional and claimed to have witnessed Ruan's previous wife with disheveled hair, causing her to become mentally disturbed. On April 21, she secretly swallowed four gold rings in a suicide attempt, which failed. On the 24th, she fatally slashed her throat with scissors and died. Afterwards, Ren's brother, Ren Benyuan, believing that Ren's death was suspicious, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou, accompanied Ruan Bingfa, and Wang Hanxiang, the cousin of Ruan's previous wife, to report the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Ruan Bingfa, Wang Hanqing, Ruan Genyou (the daughter of Ruan's previous wife), Peng Aying, and Cai Ruanshi (a relative of Ruan who shared a room with the deceased), were transferred to the district procuratorate for investigation on suspicion of assisting suicide. At the same time, Ren Benyuan also accused Ruan Bingfa, Wang Hanqing, and Peng Aying of suspicion of murder. After the district procuratorate concluded its investigation, except for Cai Ruanshi and Peng Aying, who were exempted from prosecution, Ruan and the other three were prosecuted on suspicion of assisting suicide. After an autopsy, it was proven that the deceased had no signs of resistance. However, after the deceased attempted suicide by swallowing gold, Ruan sent her to the No. 2 Hospital of the China Textile Mill on Ningguo Road for treatment. An X-ray revealed three gold rings in her abdomen. Dr. Lin Xi of the hospital instructed her to be hospitalized, but Ren refused and returned home with medication. However, he did not report it to the police station. When Ren committed suicide for the second time, Ruan and others still did not report it to the police station and failed to take preventive measures beforehand, resulting in Ren's death. This constitutes the crimes of Article 15, Paragraph 1, and Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3>Case of Melting and Selling Gold Bars Arouses Concern of City Councilors; Believe Thorough Investigation and Strict Handling Should Be Conducted Immediately; Emergency Motion to Be Proposed Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the authorities cracked down on the black market gold organization that melted and sold gold bars for profit at Jintai Yarn Shop, No. 331 Jiangxi Middle Road, the city's various sectors have been paying close attention. As for the reported involvement of a certain agency personnel with Hu Xinyi, it was confirmed yesterday that he has been dismissed from his position by the agency he served. A decision on how to handle the matter will be made after the person in charge arrives in Shanghai. Although Hu Xinyi has categorically denied the allegations of profiteering and claimed to have been carrying out a certain mission, many outsiders have seen "pure gold" that was not up to standard. There are also many reports of his manipulation of the melting of gold bars and engaging in fraud. The truth of the matter will not be difficult to uncover in the coming days. All the seized account books and files are sealed in the Special Criminal Division of the police station pending investigation. The authorities have solemnly stated that they are determined to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<p>It has also been learned that the City Council is paying close attention to the truth and future developments of this incident, given that such organizations and incidents have been discovered at a time when black markets for gold and banknotes are being vigorously investigated and dealt with. Some city councilors have expressed outrage and believe that if Hu Xinyi has indeed disrupted the financial market and harmed people's livelihood, he should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. Otherwise, the authorities should explain the whole case to dispel public doubts. It is said that they will jointly propose an emergency temporary motion today, requesting a thorough investigation of the case.</p>
<p>Hu Xinyi Ordered to Be Detained Again</p>
<p>According to a report from the East China News Agency: The Central Government has received a detailed report on the arrest of Hu Xinyi, the largest black market gold and banknote broker in the city, by the Garrison Command and the Economic Police Brigade.

It has been confirmed that Hu Xinyi is indeed a leading figure among black market gold and banknote exchange brokers in the city. It is said that the inside story of this case is extremely complex.</p>

<h3>Elegy of the Flooded South</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>[Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th by Airmail] The Southland in summer was tranquil. Although the high exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars had sent prices soaring, exceeding those of Beijing and Shanghai, the price of grain had been stable for some time, thanks to the allocation of American aid rice. This spring, abundant rain had made farmers celebrate and anticipate a bountiful harvest. They made plans to race dragon boats on the Dragon Boat Festival, hoping for a good harvest. However, the dream turned into a nightmare. An overseas hurricane arrived with the Dragon Boat Festival, followed by torrential rain. The East, West, North, and Han rivers in Guangdong Province experienced mountain floods and a surge in water levels, sounding the alarm of a flood disaster. The joyous and harmonious pastoral symphony of the Southland transformed into a tragic elegy. The hopes for a harvest vanished with the wind!</p>
<p>Impact of the Storm</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson from the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, the flood was caused by a rainstorm. It was not yet the flood season in the seventh lunar month, and the flood was just a prelude. However, the losses were already alarming. As the floodwaters have not fully receded, a precise statistic is not yet available. Based on reports from various counties, the situation is roughly as follows: The Eastern River experienced the most severe flooding, with water levels rising by more than 20 feet in just a few days. The Yuanzhou Dike in Shilong was the first to be breached, with a gap of more than 200 meters, flooding more than 30,000 mu of fertile land. The paddy fields along the Huizhou and Boluo rivers were also submerged. The disaster in Xinhui, Heshan, Kaiping, and Zhanjiang and Suixi in the South Road was particularly severe. The flood-affected area in Xinhui accounted for 70-80% of the county. In Taishan, more than 2,000 houses were destroyed in just one district, leaving thousands of people displaced. The loss of livestock and paddy fields is impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>Severe Disaster in Siyi and South Road</p>
<p>In the South Road area, more than 10,000 mu of fertile land were flooded in Suixi County alone, and more than 1,000 houses were destroyed. In Zhanjiang City, more than 3,000 houses were destroyed, and more than 100 residents were drowned or went missing. Countless residents fled their homes and were forced to live in the open at the Xiying Airport, crying for food. The devastation in the Siyi and South Road areas is unprecedented in a century.</p>
<p>Chairman Song Ziwen, upon taking office last year, stated that preventing floods was the urgent priority for the construction of Guangdong. At the end of last year, the Provincial Dike Engineering Association was established, and it was decided that the first step would be to restore the dikes to their pre-flood state last year, and then strengthen and repair the dikes. The first phase of the work has been completed. Song also planned to complete permanent water conservancy construction projects within a few years.</p>
<p>Hoping the Flood Is the End</p>
<p>Regarding relief efforts, Guangdong is to issue 50 billion yuan in emergency aid to Taishan, Xinhui, and Kaiping counties, and another 10 billion yuan in emergency aid to Zhanjiang, Suixi, and Haikang cities. Two emergency aid groups have been established for the Siyi and Leizhan regions, and they have already set off. In addition, the Dike Engineering Association and the Water Conservancy Bureau have sent a large number of technicians to the valleys to guide the people in repairing the breached dikes. According to reports from various counties, although the water is fierce, the main dikes are still strong, and there is no sign of danger. The sudden flood may be the last, and the urgent task is to step up relief efforts.</p>

<h3>Students Beat Teacher for Demanding Changing the Test Questions</h3>
<p>[Shangrao Dispatch, 28th] A case of students beating a teacher occurred at the private Zhu Tong Middle School. High school students Shu Guangbin, Yu Liji, Wang Enrong, and others thought that the math test questions set by Ye Menglin, the director of the school's guidance office, were too difficult. They gathered and questioned Ye, demanding a change of questions. Ye responded that the purpose of the exam was to assess students' performance and improve their level, and he was purely acting out of good intentions to encourage students to study. When they did not get the result they wanted, the students used violence against Ye, beating him severely and injuring him. Two workers who went to rescue him were also beaten. Afterwards, the school transferred Shu Guangbin and others to the county government for interrogation by the local prosecutor's office.</p>
<p>Jin Shaoshan before makeup (Dedicated to Yellow Prince by Ha Sha)</p>
<h3>Jin Shaoshan by the Stove</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Hong Zhenglun</p>
<p>"Living Overlord" Jin Shaoshan was a famous Northern opera performer in Jiangnan. Now he is quietly lying in an old, dark house in Beiping, accompanied by a medicine stove and tea stove, spending the rest of his life in illness, feeling particularly desolate. As for his fate, as of today, we still cannot predict it. Knowing that many readers are concerned about the life of the Overlord, our reporter made a visit and will publish it in two parts. (Editor)</p>
<p>[Beiping Dispatch, 27th by Airmail] Overlord Jin is sick, and very sick. His illness is partly due to years of hard work as a performer, and partly due to his willfulness, eccentricity, and excessive indulgence in wine and women. But his illness can also be said to be sudden. According to drama critic Ha Sha Huang, one winter last year, after Jin Shaoshan performed "Qingfeng Village" at the Sanqing Theater to慰劳(entertaining the troop), he vomited continuously and his breathing was weak. The situation was extremely dangerous at that time. After a Western doctor named Jing diagnosed him, he determined that he had peritonitis. The vomiting stopped slightly after the injection, but he was not out of danger.</p>
<p>Disobeying Doctor's Orders, Eating Mutton</p>
<p>Mr. Jing instructed him to be careful with his diet and pay attention to his movements, but Jin Shaoshan did not comply. After a day, he had a full meal of mutton, and his condition deteriorated sharply. At first, he had pain in his limbs, then swelling all over his body. The doctor diagnosed him with "peripheral neuritis." From that time on, his condition has been in a fluctuating state, lasting until now. Overlord Jin has been suffering for more than half a year!</p>
<p>Following the threat of illness is poverty. Although Overlord Jin has enjoyed fame in the art world for decades, he could not save any money in the golden age when he was used to extravagance. Today, of course, he only has empty hands. So after spending these long seven months, in addition to pawning and selling things to support the family's living expenses and medical expenses, everything else has relied on sponsorship from colleagues and friends. Although the number is considerable, using limited friendship support to fill this endless economic hole, the future is terrible.</p>
<p>"Sharing Tables" Charity Performance, Famous Performers Help</p>
<p>Recently, Ha Sha Huang and others initiated a "sharing tables" charity performance for Overlord Jin at the Chang'an Theater, with famous Beiping performers Qiu Shengrong, Xun Huisheng, Yang Baosen, Ye Shenglan, Li Duokui, Ma Fulu, Shang Xiaoyun, Tan Xiaopei, Tan Fuying, and others. If this can be realized, it will indeed be a gathering of the famous performers in Beiping at that time, and the results will be considerable, which will be of great help to his illness. When the reporter visited him, it was a hot afternoon. The Overlord was half-naked, with a cloth wrapped around his lower body, lying diagonally on the sickbed. The sickroom was the east room of a row of five rooms facing north and south. Because no one had cleaned it for a long time, the spacious room seemed unusually messy and narrow. The Overlord's face was so sallow, and his swollen feet could not even move. What was strange was that his voice was still so loud, and his eyes were still so bright, but the spirit was so far away from the spirit of the performing time.</p>
<p>Bad Temper, Difficult to Predict Destiny</p>
<p>Accompanying the reporter to his house was an old friend, Zhou Yanchen, who was specially serving him. Mr. Zhou is already 62 years old. He is the Overlord's sworn friend and Yang Xiaolou's apprentice, practicing martial arts. Since Jin Shaoshan fell ill, he has been dedicated to serving him. After Mr. Zhou explained the purpose of the visit to the Overlord, Jin Shaoshan slightly bowed, indicating to offer a seat. Because of his long-term illness, the Overlord was very lazy and did not say much, so we said goodbye. According to Mr. Zhou, Jin Sanye (because he is the third in the family, the Liyuan industry calls him Jin San) has a very bad temper. The doctor instructed him to only eat some thin things, but he wanted to eat meat buns and fried noodles. There was no way to stop him, such a weird temper that he didn't even care about his life, he said with emotion.</p>
<h3>Moganshan is Flourishing</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>[Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th] To go to Moganshan from Hangzhou, first take the Jinghang National Highway for 51 kilometers to Sanqiaobu, then turn onto the 7-kilometer road to Yucun at the foot of Moganshan. Generally speaking, the car ride on this 58-kilometer journey is much better than the bumpy state in April 1946. Moreover, several sections of the road are quite smooth, the bridges have been repaired, and the mileage markers are very clear.</p>
<p>Arriving at the foot of Moganshan, porters and sedan chair carriers are waiting for you to hire them. If you want to use them, you must negotiate with the management staff under the awning. To carry a load, the slow rate is 500,000 yuan, and the fast rate is 700,000 yuan. A sedan chair with three carriers costs 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>White rice on the mountain sells for 10 million yuan per dan, pork sells for 260,000 yuan per catty, and eggs sell for 15,000 yuan each. Except for white rice, other items are more expensive than in Hangzhou. However, the prices of mountain hotels are surprisingly high. The Moganshan Hotel costs 4 million yuan per day, including meals. There are also the Fuxing Hotel, the Luyin Hotel, etc., and the prices are quite expensive.</p>
<p>On the mountain, the sounds of sawing, hammering, and booming never stop. Many houses are under repair. Of the more than 300 houses on the mountain, only about 0.9% were destroyed. With red houses and green tiles interspersed among the green bamboo and trees, Moganshan does have a flourishing atmosphere.</p>
<p>This year, many homeowners are renting their houses to foreigners, with each house being rented for three months at a price of 40-50 dan of rice. Russians are the most common renters, with very few people from other countries. There are only one or two Americans. Some of these Russians open restaurants in the mountains after renting, while others rent and let many other Russians live there.</p>
<p>The climate here is cool, with the highest record not exceeding 80 degrees. It feels particularly cold at night, and you must cover yourself with bedding to sleep. In the early morning, you can watch the sunrise and the sea of clouds. In the evening, you can watch the sunset and the misty fog. The only drawback of Moganshan is that there is no river or sea, but you can see Taihu Lake and the Qiantang River from inside a certain house.</p>
<p>After all, this is not a peaceful and prosperous age, so there are more foreigners than Chinese coming to the mountains. We hope that next year there will be more Chinese than foreigners in the mountains.</p>

<h3>Export Industry Still Lacking Improvement After Implementation of Foreign Exchange Certificate Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the implementation of foreign exchange certificate measures, China's export industry still lacks improvement. According to import and export industry insiders, the reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Domestic prices are soaring, and the prices of export goods have also increased by more than double. Exporters are limited by funds and unable to purchase on a large scale. When foreign sales are sluggish, merchants have to sell at low prices to endure losses because the foreign exchange period is fixed. (2) The market price of foreign exchange certificates is lower than the black market price of US dollars by an average of more than 30% due to the financial authorities' planned suppression. When the selling price of foreign exchange certificates cannot be consistent with the black market price of US dollars, there are problems with exports and overseas remittances. Currently, there are two trends in the operation of the export industry: one is that small exporters have to jointly handle business with large exporters due to limited strength; the other is the dependence on foreign firms, for example, Africa is one of the main sales markets for Chinese tea, and the export of芜茶(Anhui tea) to Africa is now mostly handled by foreign firms operated by British and French people.</p>
<p>According to statistics on foreign exchange settlement by the Export Promotion Office of the Transportation Control Committee from June 20th to June 26th, based on copies of foreign exchange certificates sent by designated banks, the amount in Shanghai was approximately US$3.76 million. Among them, egg products accounted for approximately US$850,000, pig bristles US$530,000, cotton fabrics US$500,000, tung oil US$470,000, and furs US$230,000. Since the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, as of June 26th, the total export foreign exchange settlement in Shanghai was US$13.44 million.</p>
<h3>Financial Institutions Can Transfer Funds: National Banks Can Accept As Much As Possible</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It was recently learned from the National Bank that regarding the method of transferring funds between financial institutions, it has now been approved that, starting from the next business period of this year, all financial institutions, whether national agencies or commercial banks, can entrust this bank to transfer funds from their own branches or agent banks, and this bank can accept as much as possible. There will be no restrictions on any remittance destination. Funds going to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and other places can also be accepted directly, without having to be approved by the Business Bureau of this bank first. The remittance fee is temporarily set at 80% of the local bandit rate for remittance areas that are Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and various places in South China (Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces), as well as remittance areas that are North China (Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe provinces). All others are still charged at 60%. If various intermediary banks have difficulties in intermediation due to insufficient paper materials, they can negotiate with the remittance bank to handle the matter. Furthermore, the intermediation of financial institutions' telegraphic transfers should be based on the day after the exchange of funds, and holidays should be excluded. Interest will be paid at the deposit rate if overdue. If the bank has borrowed funds from this bank during the late intermediation period, interest will be paid according to the actual borrowing situation and the borrowing rate, and the payment will be paid by the intermediary bank. However, in the event that local materials are insufficient and the remittance cannot be intermediated and returned, no interest will be paid.</p>
<h3>North China Foreign Exchange Applications to Be Opened</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] It is rumored in Shanghai that the Central Bank has decided to open foreign exchange to all places from July 3rd, that is, there will be no more restrictions on the amount of remittances to and from various places. According to the Money and Coin Department of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank has not discussed the opening of remittance quotas with the Ministry of Finance. However, the application for foreign exchange in North China is scheduled to open on July 1st. The rumor may be a misunderstanding of the application for foreign exchange in North China.</p>
<h3>National Banks Increase Exchange Rates</h3>

<h3>Coal Rationing Price for July Increased by 68 Percent</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang Xiwei, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, who told reporters, the price of rationed coal for this (7th) month has been determined by the committee and has increased by approximately 68 percent compared to last month's rationing price. This price has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review a few days ago, and will be officially announced as soon as it is approved. Mr. Zhang explained the reason for this significant adjustment in the rationing price, stating that it is mainly due to the rapid increase in the cost of living and the soaring prices of foreign exchange certificates after the implementation of the new import and export foreign exchange settlement method. The cost of importing equipment and materials for various mines and labor costs are increasing daily. If the rationing price is not adjusted reasonably, the production of various coal mines will inevitably come to a standstill.</p>
<h3>Stationery Manufacturers Revise Business Methods</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices in this city have fluctuated extremely drastically. Stationery manufacturers have stated that the cost of various raw materials used daily is soaring day by day, and there is even a shortage of goods on the market, making production extremely difficult. In order to maintain their capital, they have changed their business methods starting from the 30th. The following five measures have been established:</p>
<p>(1) Before commodity prices stabilize, price increases or decreases will be estimated daily based on raw material price fluctuations and announced on a board; no new price lists or notices will be issued.</p>
<p>(2) Customers must inquire with the manufacturers about the price each day to avoid losses at the time of transaction.</p>
<p>(3) All transactions must be paid in cash; promissory notes will not be accepted. Prices will be calculated according to the current price and no discounts will be given.</p>
<p>(4) For customers in other locations, the price will be settled according to the price on the date the funds are received.</p>
<p>(5) Due to a shortage of raw materials, order acceptance will be temporarily suspended; only small quantities will be supplied to meet retail demand.</p>
<h3>Tight Silver Market at the End of June, Sluggish Cotton Yarn Trading, Cloth Market Either Little Traded or Prices are Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was quiet due to the end of June, with most customers and yarn merchants settling accounts. The initial opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was mediocre, but later, due to the two-day closure, local weaving factories made slight progress, and the price rebounded, eventually closing at 820 million yuan, a decrease of 10 million yuan from the previous day. The market for 21-count Double Horse yarn was also firm but then weakened, resulting in a loss of 30 million yuan, closing at 630 million yuan. The prices of other yarns showed mixed trends of firmness and weakness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was sluggish due to the tight silver market at the end of June and low quotations from Tianjin. At the beginning of the morning market, Five Blessings fine cloth rose by 300,000 yuan to 20.3 million yuan, with a few transactions. Later, due to some selling from northern merchants, it fell to as low as 19 million yuan, eventually closing at 20 million yuan, leveling out.</p>
<p>Outside the market, the asking price for Dragon Head fine cloth remained hovering around 21.5 million yuan, eventually reaching 2.14 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan from the previous day. The prices of other cloths were firm and rising due to high indices and firm sentiment.</p>
<p>Another report: The selling price of the Four Gentlemen Serge cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company the previous day was determined to be 20 million yuan. Due to merchants from Sichuan Province searching for purchases, it rose to as high as 22.5 million yuan. Later, due to the tight money supply, there was no shortage of sales, and at 10 o'clock it dropped to 1.5 million yuan, eventually closing at 21.8 million yuan, an increase of 1.8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>City Markets to Close for Holiday Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Tea Market Remains Strong and Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of trading for the semi-annual settlement period for the silver and money industry. Although the money supply in the market continued to be tight, most of the industry's positions were balanced. At the same time, it was heard that the production prices of black and green tea were soaring, so the principals were all cautious and steady, and were not in a hurry to sell any of the various varieties. The process remained strong and steady. In terms of prices, there was still demand, and the foundation was quite solid. However, the number of transactions was still few and far between, as the negotiations were not smooth.</p>
<h3>Checks Issued by Cooperatives Do Not Have Negotiable Instrument Effect</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously noticed that many credit cooperatives were issuing checks, resulting in many checks with cooperatives as payees circulating on the market. The Ministry of Finance believed that this type of check was in conflict with Article 123 of the Negotiable Instruments Law and ordered a ban on September 26, 1947. Since then, various credit cooperatives have issued statements claiming that issuing checks is actually for the convenience of depositors and is essentially no different from the banking industry. In order to be cautious, the Ministry of Finance specially requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan. According to the resolution of the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of the Judicial Yuan on May 31, checks with cooperatives as payees cannot be issued according to the regulations of the cooperatives. The Judicial Yuan has also ordered the courts in various regions to notify that this type of check does not have the effect of a negotiable instrument, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has telegraphed all credit cooperatives in the country not to issue this type of check again, in violation of laws and regulations. The Ministry of Finance has also instructed the local financial management bureaus to instruct banks and money shops not to accept this type of check. The local financial management bureau in this city has also received the Ministry of Finance's order and has notified the banking, money lending, and trust industries to comply.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Close Accounts, Securities Exchange Handles Deliveries</h3>
<p>Yesterday, banks and money shops closed their semi-annual accounts, and the securities exchange handled stock deliveries.

The money supply was extremely tight, and the distance between Class A and Class B bonds widened to around 1.4 yuan. Class A bonds traded at around 89 yuan, and Class B bonds traded strongly at 90 yuan. Chinese stocks were restricted by the money supply. Yong Yarn, which was delivered that day, traded at 5,000 to 5,100 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the situation became even more unfavorable, and the selling price for the entire batch of waiting orders was even lower than 5,000 yuan. Those who opened and delivered traded at 5,400 to 5,500 yuan. Only Class C bonds of the unified bonds had sporadic transactions, and the price stabilized at around 600,000 yuan. The unofficial lending rate was extremely high, with few supplies for those seeking loans at more than 40%.</p>
<h3>Money Supply Extremely Tight</h3>

The market interest rate was as high as 45%, and there was a widespread shortage of orders in the commercial market.

<p>[Central News Agency this city] The joint graduation ceremony for the 37th year of the Republic of China for Soochow University and Zhejiang University was held at Jinglin Church on Kunshan Road at 10:00 am yesterday. Vice Minister Hang from the Ministry of Education came to Shanghai from Beijing to participate. Over a thousand people, including all graduates of the two schools and guests, attended. After the ceremony, Pastor Xie Songgao prayed first, followed by a speech by Chairman Dr. Li Peien. After the speech, Vice Minister Hang gave a speech, saying: "Soochow and Zhejiang Universities are both long-standing and promising institutions, not only cultivating a large number of talents for the country, but also laying the foundation for good friendship between the Chinese and American people. You have now graduated, which can be said to be the result of general education. The Constitution of the Republic of China has clear provisions on education, which is that education and culture should develop the nation's national spirit, autonomous spirit, national morality, sound physique, science, and life skills. Looking back on the four-year course of study, although the country has not yet stabilized, it is fortunate that you have completed your studies in difficult circumstances. From now on, you must enter society to serve, and what you have learned in school can now be used as a test. You must know that doing things in society is like fighting a war, and you should have a fighting spirit to achieve success. Therefore, I would like to give you the words "advance" as an encouragement. At present, the domestic situation, whether in politics, economy, finance, or education, may not be satisfactory, but you must never be pessimistic, disappointed, or decadent because of this. You must have the determination to move forward bravely. Finally, I hope that you will have two points: (1) Have self-confidence, (2) Cultivate a faithful spirit of service, and you will surely make good contributions to the country and the people in the future." Finally, degrees were awarded to 175 graduates from the Soochow College of Arts, Sciences, and Law, including Xu Baoxian, and 72 graduates from the Zhejiang College of Arts, Commerce, Industry, and Mechanical Engineering, including Wei Meili.</p>
<h3>National Banks Stipulate Application Deadline for Living Expenses for Students Studying Abroad Who Are Ill</h3>

<h3>Philippine Baseball Champions, the Red Sox, Arrive in Shanghai; Exhibition Match Scheduled Immediately; Chinese Team to Play</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Red Sox team, the champions of the Manila Bay Baseball League in the Philippines, a group of fifteen people, arrived in Shanghai by plane on Tuesday afternoon. They are expected to stay here for a week and play three exhibition games with the maritime strong team.</p>
<p>Game Schedule</p>
<p>July 3rd Saturday</p>
<p>China - Red Sox American Boys School</p>
<p>July 4th</p>
<p>China - Red Sox Racecourse</p>
<p>July 5th</p>
<p>US Armed Forces League - Red Sox Racecourse</p>
<p>The level of baseball in the Philippines is historically high. The skillful skills and impressive record of the Philippine team when they conquered Shanghai before the war can still be remembered by old baseball fans. Since the Red Sox team has won the league title, their strength must be strong. Baseball in Shanghai is still in its infancy, and it may be difficult to compete with them. The lack of ideal talent for pitchers is especially a major problem. Yu Changjian of China is experienced and skilled, but he has not yet reached the peak of perfection. Therefore, there is talk that China will recruit McKinley, a strong man from the Air Force, for the first game. If so, the strength will be greatly enhanced, but it is still difficult to compete with the Philippine veteran Osinin.</p>
<p>The Bank of New York Manila Branch and the American-Philippine Joint Association of this city have each donated a large silver cup to be awarded to the winners of the first two games for commemoration. The presentation ceremony will be held after the game is over.</p>
<p>Also, the Red Sox team originally planned to have a practice match with the Chinese team at the Racecourse at 4:00 pm today to test the venue, but due to rain and wet ground, it may be difficult to hold it according to the original plan.</p>

In addition to gymnastics, the training courses also include physical education lectures and gymnastic trips, which are no different from a small summer camp. If you are particularly strong and have some training in gymnastics, you can still request to register to participate.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao's Map</h3>
<p>— Wang Qi</p>
<p>An Opinion from a Reader</p>
<p>Shen Bao's map is epoch-making in the history of Chinese maps. We might as well say that since the publication of this map, China has had modern maps. This spring, I wrote an article on the publishing industry in the Ta Kung Pao, "Talking about Maps," and especially recommended Shen Bao's topographic map of China. This map is a wall map, divided into four sheets, pieced together into a whole, equivalent to gathering the previously published provincial atlases and hanging them on the wall. The editors were also Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang. Originally, this map was published in the 28th year of the Republic during wartime, so it was rarely seen in Shanghai (although it was still printed by Yongning Company, renamed from Zhongfeng Bookstore). It was offered for sale at a low price last winter, priced at only 80,000 yuan. By February of this year, it was still 80,000, almost like a gift. Based on that heavy-weight wood-made paper and exquisite index, the market price would be no less than several million yuan! After I wrote this article, I immediately received a letter from Mr. Zeng Shiying in Nanjing, saying that a revised map after the war was being compiled, and hoped that I would contribute my opinions. This kind of humility is truly the demeanor of a scholar. Unfortunately, although I love maps, I am a complete layman in map studies. Even if I wanted to imitate a mountain villager offering his humble gift, I couldn't do it. I feel somewhat ashamed of this to Mr. Zeng. My reply only said that I hoped the new map would be published quickly to meet the needs. And this hope is about to be realized.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, in terms of topography, there is no big difference between the old map and the new map, unless there are new measurements of longitude and latitude lines and heights. Therefore, the new maps on the market completely copy the old map. As for the newly drawn provinces and regions in the Northeast and the newly added Taiwan Province, they are all taken from Japanese drawings, cut and modified. Some may not have even seen the Japanese things, so there are very few that can satisfy people. Under the Japanese management in the Northeast, the humanistic situation has changed greatly. New railways have been built, and new industrial cities have been developed. If there is no detailed record, it is equivalent to having no map of the Northeast. In the later period, the Japanese devoted great efforts to the mapping of the Northeast, while in the early period, the Japanese even copied from China. That is, Kobayashi Matashichi stole the Northeast part of Shen Bao's New Map of the Republic of China and changed it to the New Measured Map of Manchuria. Kobayashi Matashichi was the printer of China's New World Map. This matter is described in detail in Mr. Zeng's preface to the Topographic Map of the Republic of China. Mr. Zeng's article in the publishing industry of this newspaper mentioned it again the day before yesterday. It is a shame that China has this kind of new map, but it cannot be printed. (Shanghai has copper plate engraving, but only two plates can be produced each year. A large map has fifty or sixty sheets, which will take more than twenty years to complete. It is shocking to say!) When the Japanese army invaded, Kobayashi Matashichi set up branches in Beijing and Shanghai. However, most of the maps he printed were for military use, and outsiders could not peek at them. The maps circulating on the market are not better than those in China. Even the printing paper became extremely shoddy.</p>
<p>Many people are not very clear about the difference between China's New Map and the provincial maps. Originally, the New Map was the official publication celebrating the 60th anniversary of Shen Bao, a huge 1:2,000,000 map that does not follow provincial divisions. It only cuts the country into several units, each unit being a sheet, and each sheet is divided into humanistic and natural maps, each with an index drawn in front, that is, a certain unit is specially printed with oblique lines in the whole map to indicate it. At the back, there is a general index of place names, which is equivalent to a dictionary of place names. When this book was published, it was priced at 25 yuan. If converted according to the price of goods, it should be 50 to 60 million now! It is also because of the readers' purchasing power and the time required for printing that a provincial atlas was compiled for general and student use. The ratio is 1:3,000,000, and the topography and humanities are combined into one, divided into provinces. This is what everyone is used to seeing, and I don't need to say it. As for the topographic map mentioned above, it is specially designed for classroom teaching. It can be said to be perfect in the compilation of topographic maps.</p>
<p>However, people's hearts cannot be satisfied. We who like to read maps are definitely not satisfied with a thin provincial atlas. We are very much looking forward to the re-compilation of China's New Map. Before it is possible to re-compile all of it, it seems to be a good way to first revise and publish the northeastern and southwestern provinces and Taiwan as supplements to those who already have new maps. I don't know what Shen Bao and Mr. Zeng think about this matter? Also, I heard that Da Zhongguo Bookstore, a local company specializing in publishing maps, is already starting to compile a brand new large map, whose size will be comparable to Shen Bao's large map, and will be color-coded by county. This news is very exciting. It seems that due to the guidance of Shen Bao, China also has specialized map-making publishers. However, Shen Bao is still the oldtimer. I have seen the maps published by the American Times and Collier's, and their details are not necessarily as good as those of Shen Bao. As long as things are done by people and are willing to spend money on useful undertakings, there will always be excellent results. We have another proof of this in Shen Bao's map.</p>
<h3>Beggar Daily</h3>
<p>— Matsuura</p>
<p>In the suburbs of Vienna, there was a small hotel where a "Beggars Club" was established before World War I. By 1914, the number of members had reached 1,800. Therefore, a "Beggars Daily" was founded, with content about beggars' welfare news, beggars' living conditions, beggars' interesting reading materials, and biographies of great men among beggars. Each copy was sold for half a penny, with a daily circulation of about 4,000 copies. It is said that a Hungarian gentleman with a collecting hobby collected all the "Beggars Daily" and later sold it to the Paris Library for 80 francs.</p>
<h3>Worshipping Wen Tianxiang's Words</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Jiangxin Temple in Yongjia is the place where Wenshan crossed the sea south to inspect Wang's oath. After his defeat and martyrdom, the villagers built a temple to commemorate him. The poem says that the water is all around, and two pagodas are inserted in the east and west, where egrets gather, and the wings become snow in the hot summer, which is a spectacle. In the past, I wandered around and paid homage three times. Now it is suddenly possible to look back, and it has been half a century, which is lamentable!</p>
<p>The river flows to the sea and folds back, the mountain势 floats in the air and wants to shake, the twin towers rotate the stars and moon day after day, and the lonely minister looks at the temple cloud tide alone; living to arrange all the tribulations the sky is still attached, and dying for nearly a thousand years the captives are still half defeated; the tail Kuo washes the streets and new dreams pass, and the stone tablet has no tears to the former dynasty.</p>
<p>The layers of the sky remotely control the water and fly high, and the unceasing bells come out from above. It is difficult to dedicate silence to this Jiangcheng. Alas, public body and hands are the most majestic! Whose fault was it that the mountain changed color? The country still praises the loyalty but the tomb has been abandoned. What is the matter of continuing Zhongxing in later generations? It is expected that people and ghosts are both frightened.</p>
<p>Eight years of war alone climbed Deng Lin. Floating Guo car is deep in the desert Han. The sea atmosphere is yellow and the silkworm wheat shadow is broken, and the market lights are red and corroded with the hearts of the people. There is no beef wine to sacrifice in March, but I see rich people waving money, the ancient Buddha does not say that fish and birds are scattered, may they enter the ground and put on their clothes!</p>
<p>Foot stepping on flying dust, temples full of sand, years of wandering as home, people forget the Chai market because of unrighteousness, I will sail to Yongjia, outside the fence, the desolate crows splash ink, the Jiangxin郁 is angry and the waves are blooming, before returning, I can see the shadow of the clothes, a stroke of the sky is clear and the sun is not slanting.</p>
<h3>Graduation and Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Pingxi</p>
<p>Recently, I often read appeals and news in the newspaper about the employment problems of this year's summer college graduates. Most of them emphasize that 30,000 to 50,000 young people will move from the campus to society, which is really not easy to arrange. This is usually the case around the summer vacation every year, but this year it seems even more serious. Just like the issuance of legal currency has caused currency flooding and abundant hot money, the expansion of talents makes the phenomenon of overstaffing even more obvious.</p>
<p>If graduation is unemployment, then why waste a few years of studying under the window? But some people also say that even if you don't go to school or graduate, you will mostly be unemployed in this society. A few days ago, there was a publicly funded student from a national school who was willing to stay in school for further studies for fear that there would be no public funds to support him after graduation. The school has simply become a short-term unemployment shelter. If studying is a profession, then graduation is equivalent to dismissal, and the result of graduation is naturally unemployment.</p>
<p>The reason why graduates cannot find jobs is partly because education is divorced from practicality, so others would rather choose someone who has no diploma but has experience to take office, but are unwilling to let scholars come to fill the ranks. In addition, there is another reason, that is, young people often consider themselves extraordinary after obtaining diplomas and degrees, so they have great ambitions and expectations as soon as they leave the thatched cottage. Ordinary positions are not in their eyes, let alone asking them to do labor or farming. The oversupply of intellectuals is really related to their own arrogance.</p>
<p>This is of course a failure of education. How can the "talents" cultivated by universities become an unemployed reserve army! However, the students themselves should also reflect. If you are willing to infiltrate this vast society, you must first abandon the superiority that "literati" often have!</p>
<h3>South Lake Boat Girl</h3>
<p>— Ren Xian</p>
<p>People who come to Jiaxing to play will of course go to Nanhu; people who go to Nanhu must also hire a boat. If you are a tourist who has only been there once, I am afraid that few people know that there are various kinds of boats. Because the author is registered in Jiaxing, I know a little about it.</p>
<p>The ordinary boat girls standing near the Dongmen Bridge, who come up to ask "Going to Nanhu?" when foreign guests pass by, are all "old lady boats." The old ladies are about 40 to 50 years old. Their dress is exactly the same as that of rural women, often a blue or white cloth short shirt and black cloth trousers; but they are cleaned up neatly.</p>
<p>Another type is called "girl boat." There is a girl on the boat who does not row the boat, but acts as a receptionist (the word "receptionist" is extracted by me). The rower is still an old lady. The girls call the old ladies "Mma." These girls do not go ashore to solicit customers. Their ages range from seventeen or eighteen to twenty-one or two. People who hire girl boats are of course mostly male guests. Their boat fare is several times higher than that of old lady boats. For example, if it costs 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to hire an old lady boat now, then a girl boat will cost 2 to 3 million. Some guests often bring girls to the "Smoky Rain Tower" to accompany them for a long-distance view, eat tea and snacks, and this girl will think that she is very lucky.</p>
<h3>Green Window Small Talk</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>In summer, I like the countryside. The green fields, the shady mountains and forests, the dragonflies skimming the water, the swallows passing through the beams, and the melon racks and bean trellises that are full of poetry and painting... everything shows a kind of serenity, leisure, and tranquility. Du Fu's poem says: "A clear river embraces the village and flows, and everything is secluded in the river village in the long summer." What a lovely picture this is. So I think that summer in the countryside is much more refreshing and organized than the bustling city in the soft red dust.</p>
<p>The most longing for is the daily homework in the flowers of Weng Huayin in West Lake in summer, such as:</p>
<p>"Get up in the morning and wear lotus leaves as clothes, absorb dew by the flower branches to moisten the lungs, and teach parrots poetry. In the middle of the day, casually read a few pages of Lao Zhuang, or spread out the calligraphy posts to write by the pool. In the afternoon, take off the middle stone wall, occupy the frame bed, and talk with friends who have forgotten their shape about the mountains and seas. If you are tired, take the left palace pillow and swim around the country of Hua Xu. In the afternoon, cut the coconut cup, float the melons and sink the plums, and pound the lotus flower to drink Bifang wine. After taking a bath in the orchid soup in the afternoon, steer a small boat and fish by the ancient rattan curved water. At dusk, wearing a bamboo hat and a pu fan, stand on a high hill and watch the gardeners hold pots and water the flowers."</p>
<p>This kind of life is no different from that of a god, it is truly the "idealization" to the extreme. Reading this passage makes people wash away their worldly dust and refresh their muscles and bones. In the meditation with closed eyes, it is as if being in another realm, drifting away and "temporarily forgetting the world here." Sima Qian said: "Although I cannot reach it, my heart yearns for it." I am also the same here.</p>
<h3>Sour Grapes and Ah Q</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>For thirty years, Ah Q has been talked about to the point of being boring. People have given Ah Q the most detailed annual genealogy and examined his life experience; they have also put him on the stage and sent him abroad. Therefore, it seems unnecessary for me to talk about Ah Q again now, repeating the old tune. I remember when Mr. Lu Xun first gave birth to Ah Q, the whole family held this difficult birth and looked at him with every frown and smile with a lot of emotion. But later, the plain boiled water became more and more bland, and the tea leaves became weaker and weaker. Today, when people hear about Ah Q, they at most recall fragments of stories such as "son beating father" or "sleeping with Wu Ma." It is rare for anyone to spend three minutes thinking about it. It is like Granny Liu entering the Grand View Garden for the last time, watching the decline of the Ningrong families, inevitably feeling a little vicissitudes. I watched the decline of Ah Q's status now and in the past, and my eyelashes inevitably moved a little.</p>
<p>People say that Ah Q is not a peony, and it is not a special product of our country. Foreign countries also have people who are good at eating sour grapes or sweet lemons. Sour grapes are a kind of self-justification: people can't eat grapes, so they say the grapes are sour. Sweet lemons are also a kind of self-justification: people have already eaten sour lemons, but they insist that the lemons are sweet. Many people forget Ah Q because they feel that foreign grapes are also sour or lemons are also sweet. Ah Q seems to have been established in our hearts for thirty years, and his negativity, cowardice, and ignorance have been familiar to us for too long, so we cannot see this lover clearly. Officials don't seek efficiency, as long as the breeze comes and the breeze goes, they are considered first-class good officials; soldiers are considered first-class good soldiers as long as they don't desert. Businessmen only seek to make a living; students only need to pass. No one knows whether they eat to live or live to eat.</p>
<h3>Compiling the New Map of China (III)</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the U.S. 14th Air Force conducted surveying and mapping covering almost half of the country. If one draws a straight line from Tengchong in Yunnan to Chengde in Rehe, the southeastern part of this line was mostly photographed. The Army Map Service used this to produce navigation charts. Their advantage lies in the realism of the terrain. Details such as river meanders, lake shapes, and even the spread of coastal sandbars are all consistent with the recent actual situation. This edition of the new map largely draws upon this source.</p>
<p>During the occupation, the Japanese also compiled 1:50,000 scale maps based on aerial surveys conducted in the areas of Jiangsu and Anhui. The section of the Waibu River south of Shouxian on this map has been improved accordingly. Furthermore, surveying and mapping in Taiwan was largely completed a long time ago. The map used here is the 1:50,000 topographic map reprinted by the United States, and is mostly complete except for the area near Mount Niitaka (Mount Morrison).</p>
<p>Finally, it is necessary to mention the data from the Northwest. The eastern part of Xikang Province is roughly based on the route of Mr. Cui Kexin, the director of the provincial Geological Survey. Mr. Cui spent several years investigating in Kang, and his footprints covered the eastern part of Kang. It is a pity that he was limited by equipment and unable to make altitudinal observations. The northern parts of Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces use Russian maps reprinted by Americans. The scale of this map is 1:1,500,000, and it was published in 1941. The terrain is represented using hatching, with occasional elevation notations. There are also the results of the former Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition in Xinjiang Province. These were organized in Sweden for nearly ten years and recently published in the United States. According to the plan, there should be thirteen sheets, but only three are available here. The U.S. Army Map Service has also compiled a 1:1,000,000 scale map in the same area, which is also a valuable source.</p>
<p>Regarding the compilation method, first, it is necessary to briefly describe the style and map sheet distribution of the new map. This map includes a general map and fourteen statistical maps, as well as twenty-five provincial maps. The scale of the former is roughly 1:15,000,000.</p>
<p>The latter, except for Mongolia, are all at a scale of 1:3,000,000. Each sheet is based on a province and printed to the edge of the paper. City and other insets are not attached to the map, so that adjacent map sheets can be joined together to form a complete map of any region. To meet this requirement, a single simple projection is not used; each sheet is a part thereof. The projection used in this map is the Lambert Conformal Conic projection, with standard parallels at 24 degrees and 48 degrees North latitude. The biggest drawback of applying this method is that the measurement error in the central part (at 36 degrees North latitude) reaches 2.2%, which means that the length of one kilometer on the ground near this line is 978 meters on the map. This difference in scale is not difficult to calculate using a certain method, and the impact on ordinary map users is extremely small. However, to meet this condition of mutual connectivity, the consumption of labor and paper in the drawing is almost tripled. In the past, the portions outside the province were usually covered with insets, but now the entire area must be drawn, leaving no room for shortcuts.</p>
<p>The back of each map is printed in monochrome with a transportation map of the area, showing every station and mileage of railways and highways, as well as the navigability of rivers.</p>
