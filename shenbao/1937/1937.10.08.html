<h3>美國政府正式宣布日本侵略違反條約</h3>
<p>我政府感慰外部今日發宣言　法總理已贊同英首相即響應　羅斯福下月開國會臨時會議</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國政府今日正式宣布日本爲侵略國、及破壞九國公約與凱洛非戰公約、是則美國已以全力爲國聯之後盾矣、國務部於羅斯福總統痛斥世界違法國家之後、卽繼之發表宣言、謂“美國已不得不承認日本在中國之行動、不合國際關係之原則、並違背九國公約與凱洛公約之規定、”按美國正式宣布他國侵略及違背和平條約、此次猶屬創舉、政府方面認此舉已實踐羅斯福總統演說中所包含之意義、總統曾謂、愛好和平之國家、對於世界戰爭之威脅、如能取聯合行動以制止之、美國當追隨擁護、現在國務部之聲明、適於國聯議决召集九國公約舉行會議之後發表、其意義已非常明顯、惟國務部亦聲稱、美國參加會議與否、必須俟接得正式邀請後、始能决定、至於國務院聲明內容、略稱、“自遠東方面發生爭端以來、美國政府卽力請中日政府勿啟戰亂、並願協助雙方謀得和平解决之方法、國務部長赫爾曾於七月十六日及八月二十三日兩次聲明美國之立塲、美國以爲國際關係之原則、應竭力避免使用武力及干涉他國內政、國際間各項問題應和平折衝、同時亦須尊重他國之權利及條約之神聖、十月五日羅斯福總統更詳細闡明此種原則、且鄭重聲明、苟無全體遵守之法律及道德標準、國際間卽無安寧與和平可言、而國際間之無政府狀態卽將使和平之基礎摧殘盡絕、世界各國無論大小、其安全均將遭受危害、故美國爲顧全本國人民之切身利益起見、主張國際條約必須尊重、國際道德必須恢復、美國政府此種意見與國聯大會之意見、大致相同”云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>［紐約］羅斯福總統最近巡視國內各大城市、足跡所經、計達一萬三千公里、頃已自芝加哥城返抵海德公園城、稍作休憇、將於本月八日遄返華盛頓、消息靈通人士頃宣稱、羅斯福總統現因國際時局甚爲嚴重、擬於下月召集國會臨時會議、加以討論云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［紐約］美國海軍同志會會長郝巴特今日向美聯社宣稱、美國應將全部艦隊集中馬尼刺、此舉卽可阻止日本在遠東之窮兵黷武行動、美國並應與英國合作、且須利用新加坡及香港之英海軍根據地云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>［南京］美國國務院宣言、聲斥日本侵略中國、中國政府聞之極爲感慰、認此項宣言雖稍遲緩、但屬美國態度之實質表示、足以顯示美國對於此種重要問題、已有至審愼之考盧、中國方面並表示希望、九國公約簽字國會議能早日實現、因此會議定能滿足中日兩國愛護和平之人民、依照九國公約及凱洛格公約而解决當前紛爭之願望也、惟最近意大利輿論近有袒日之傾向、殊覺可異、（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<p>［南京］美總統羅斯福五日演說對侵略國痛加斥責、希望各國出以積極行動、我國各方對此異常同情興奮、政界人士尤爲滿意、謂可促進世界和平、予侵略者有所警惕、美總統演說全文、七日晨由美駐華大使館送達我外部、（七日專電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］法總理旭丹今日嚮應美總統羅斯福之演說、允許贊助任何國際行動、以停止中國及西班牙之戰事、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］美國參戰軍人代表來此游歷、頃於本日由美國俱樂部予以招待、國務總理旭丹親自出席發表演說、略稱、美國大總統羅斯福前日所發表之演說、與法國政策各項主要原則、若合符節、希望此項演說、將在全世界引起“深刻而歷久之反應”、旭丹總理復稱、“國家之生活、當以尊重國際法爲其基礎、孤立之行動、不僅缺乏效力、且甚爲危險、惟有愛護和平各民族之共同意志及共同决心、方足以阻止侵略而不任其超越、至於法國、對於任何創議之以愛好和平各國密切聯繫爲目的者、無不加以熱烈贊助、則又無待於辭贅也”云、（中央七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］外交部長台爾搏斯本日傍晚延見美國代辦威爾遜、當告以羅斯福總統昨日所發表之演說、與法國所行政策之原則、適相符合、法國方面聞悉之餘、至感滿意云、法國負責方面並謂、羅斯福總統演說、至爲重要、並以爲總統之意、特別注重於歐洲時局、而遠東時局次之、總統所稱“世界各國愛好和平者佔百分之九十、而百分之十則威脅一切國際法律與人道原則、因此前者對於後者必須有一控制之”數語、係指美國現雖不能放棄中立地位、但總統對於愛好和平各國所進之努力、則因擬儘量予以贊助也、總之、目前國際糾紛威脅日甚、凡屬愛好和平之民治國、業已漸漸醒覺、設法加以應付、此於羅斯福總統之演說、可以獲得證明矣、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］保守黨第六十四屆常年大會、本日晨間、在斯加波羅城開幕、張伯倫首相定於明日前往發表宣言、用以答復美國總統羅斯福日昨在該國芝加哥城所發表之外交演說、屆時列席旁聽者、已有五千人預定座位、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［日內瓦］國聯大會本日午後五時開會、討論中日糾紛决議案、挪威與南非聯邦代表曾於昨日大會中、要求延會一日、俾向各該國政府請訓、本日開會後、各該國代表聲明業已接獲政府訓令、决定投贊成票、至此大會卽未經辯論、而將中日問題諮詢委員會昨日所提出之决議草案、全塲一致表决通過、（僅波蘭與暹羅棄權）作爲定案、主席卽印度代表阿迦汗當宣稱、本人卽當依照此項决議案、採取各項必要措置、大會茲亦次定延會而不閉會、以便於諮詢會提出要求時、卽行召集開會、旋卽依照决議案所載辦法簽署邀請書、以便邀請各會員國凡係九國公約簽字國者、儘速依據該公約第七條規定舉行會議、査國聯會會員國之爲九國公約簽字國者、計有中·法·比·意·荷·葡萄牙·暨不列顛帝國七國、其中不列顛帝國包括英國·加拿大·南非聯邦·澳洲聯邦·紐西蘭·印度六國、此外各國凡於九國公約成立之後、陸續簽字加入者、尙有玻璃維亞·丹麥·墨西哥·挪威·瑞典五國、因此大會主席阿迦汗之邀請書、乃向上開十七國政府發出之、至非會員國而係簽字國之美日兩國暨會員國而非簽字國之蘇聯、是否予以邀請、則當由上開十七國予以决定、開會地點大抵爲倫敦、阿迦汗主席於簽署此項邀請書後、卽發表簡短演說以資結束、略謂“目前主要問題、乃係人類與人類尊嚴問題、一民族所遭受之痛苦、其他各民族亦必感同身受，一民族之削弱勢必招致其他各民族之削弱、反之、一民族之進展、則必同爲其他各民族之福利、凡此已非空洞之理想、而爲各國當局與良善意志之人士、所應遵循之南針也”（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］關於中日兩國糾紛、美國國務院頃發表公報稱、美國駐瑞士公使哈利遜、頃以國聯會大會中日問題諮詢委員會關於中日糾紛所通過之次議案、電達國務院、並告以國聯大會又於本日午後予以表决通過云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>顧維鈞表示欣慰</h3>
<p>國際道德標準　東西祇有一個</p>
<p>［日內瓦］中國出席國聯總代表顧維鈞博士、今日對於美國務院斥責日本侵略國一點、深爲欣慰、認爲足以加强國聯反對日本之决議案之力量、美國務院之宣言、又與國聯諮詢委員會審愼研究事實所得之結論、完全相同、於是可見世界文明各國所認識之國際道德標凖、僅有一個、顧氏繼謂、愛好和平之國家、若欲享受和平與安全之福利、則須藉共同一致之行動、重行樹立條約義務之神聖性、於今日遠東歐西之嚴重狀態下、第二次大戰之能否避難、即以我人能否將謀人類福利及文明之合作生活重行恢復以爲斷、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>英美交換意見</h3>
<p>籌備太平洋會議事宜　地點倫敦華盛頓未定</p>
<p>［倫敦］國聯大會通過决議案、規定召集九國公約各簽字國舉行會議之後、英美兩國政府現正交換意見、藉以確定組織問題、尤其是關於開會日期地點與出席代表之選擇問題、英國負責人士頃宣稱、此次會議若果在華盛頓舉行、則歐洲關係各國外交部長、恐不能親自出席、而當由各該國駐美大使充任代表云（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］太平洋會議日期與地點刻在討論中、據測、開會日期、至早當在兩星期內、以言開會地點、倫敦與巴黎固屬相宜、但一九二二年會議係在華盛頓舉行、故今未可忽視、且羅斯福總統之演說、已使國聯若干方面抱開會應在華盛頓之念矣、（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間官塲今日以爲美總統羅斯福之演說、及美國務院斥責日本爲侵略國之言論、目的純在左右九國公約國會議之形勢、英內閣聞已指示外相艾登、立卽向華盛頓方面探詢對於遠東時局合作之程度、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］國聯對於擁護九國公約之十七個會員國、現已發出通知、若美俄德三國參加、則可凑成二十國之數、此間官員皆信、該會於三星期內當能於倫敦或華盛頓二地擇一舉行、國聯發言人對於美國之行動、極表滿意、以美國對於世界事件、雖向採超然態度、但今茲對於國聯則已表示其密切合作之意響矣、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>太平洋會議意不參加</h3>
<p>［羅馬］今日此間得悉、意國將不參加遠東會議、意國不能接受國聯任何請書、意國現方抵制國聯、必至其承認征服阿比西尼亞而後已、據官塲聲稱、因日本前未參加國聯之舉動、故墨索里尼將永不取排日步驟云、（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<h3>俄大使已飛抵莫斯科</h3>
<p>陸軍參賛亦乘飛機回國</p>
<p>［南京］外交界息、蘇聯駐華大使鮑格莫格夫、於上月杪奉該國政府召飛回、已於五日上午、安抵莫斯科、聞蘇使此行、一俟公舉、卽行回任、並不作久留云、（六日中央社電）</p>
<p>［南京］蘇聯駐華大使鮑格莫洛夫聞已飛抵莫斯科、該大使館陸軍參贊勒賓將軍亦已於星期二自蕪湖乘特備飛機飛往莫斯科云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>世界輿論一致</h3>
<p>美政府官員談國際合作　解决嚴重問題良好基礎</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美政府官員今日對美聯社記者言、國聯大會幾於全體一致通過宣佈日本違反九國公約及非戰公約之决議案、足見世界輿論之一致、此爲世界之合作應付當前嚴重問題之良好基礎美國自中日戰爭發生之後、自始即不主以九國公約之狹隘基礎應付局面、良以破壞國際條約掀動二次世界大戰之大問題、絕非少數國家之問題、而爲世界各國全體之問題也、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>首批藥品自英運華</h3>
<p>［倫敦］中國購料委員會已設法將悶藥·以太·破傷風預防血清·瓦斯止痛藥水·腆酒等醫藥品共一噸、交大英輪船公司之拉傑浦太那號運往中國、該委員會之中英委員、今日將親往江岸監視裝運、此爲輸往中國之第一批醫藥品、至於第二批則將於星期六日由英帝國航空公司運出、（中央社七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國再接再厲造成國際新局勢</h3>
<p>和平民族可爲有效合作　蘇俄政界表示極爲滿意</p>
<p>［日內瓦］關於中日問題、國聯會人士頃加以評論、謂美國羅斯福總統所發表之演說、及美國國務院昨日所發表之聲明、足令愛護和平之各國、可作有効之協同行動、且使未來太平洋會議、獲有成功之機會、抑國務院所發表之聲明、表示美國接受國聯會對於中日問題所作之結論、故較羅斯福之演說意義、尤爲重要、官方人士復稱、羅斯福總統現擬以渠在芝加哥發表演說之全文、抄送國聯會秘書處、藉以表示渠與國聯會意見一致云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統在芝加哥所發之演說、有改變美國近年孤立政策之意、此間人士、以爲總統此項新政策、與美國亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾所採之堅强立塲、互有關係、美艦隊總司令保護遠東美僑之舉、現已爲人所嘉許、雖許多美人以爲中立與孤立、乃保障國家利益之最善辦法、然雅納爾總司令之舉、則以美國海軍與國家决不能稍失威望爲前提、華盛頓郵報今日著論、稱讚羅斯福總統之演說、謂若干抱懦弱卑怯者流、以爲美國對於殘暴侵略國、與無辜被侵略國、二者之間、未見有何區別者、從此當可永遠銷滅、名義不正之中立政策、顯然已因美總統之言論、而不能適用於中日戰爭、總之、總統在實際上已警告日意德三國、此種侵略行爲、美國不獨消極痛恨之、且將積極抵抗之云、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］美國國務院於昨日發表聲明、譴責日本在中國之行動、並表示接受國聯會大會對於中日問題所作結論、英國政界人士極爲重視、認爲係國際局勢之一種新發表、關係甚爲重大、蓋此項聲明發表之後、美國接受參加國聯會所召集之九國公約各簽字國會議、殆已完全確定矣、總之、政界人士認爲美國國務院此項聲明、較諸前日羅斯福總統所發表之演說、更進一步、則以由此證明美國已决定言辭而進於行動故也、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］關於美國總統羅斯福昨日所發表之演說、蘇聯政界人士極爲滿意、對於華盛頓半官界人士所作之解釋、卽認爲羅斯福總統之言、乃籲請太平洋問題關係各國採取共同行動、以遏制日本侵略行爲一層、尤爲注意、蘇聯政界人土並謂、和平思想愈益有力、至可欣慰、所望羅斯福總統此項態度、足以左右英法兩國、尤其是可使英國放棄其對於遠東與歐洲各侵略國所抱之現行政策云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙紐約　紐約泰晤士報頃評論羅斯福總統在芝加哥城所發表之演說、及美國國務院昨日所發表之聲明、主張應迅速召集九國公約各簽字國舉行會議、其言略謂“美國人民對於遠東事變、極爲衝動、美國自應會同其他各國、考盧保障國際公法之方法、日本蓄意播散破壞種子、中國遂乃遭其禍殃、吾人對於和平之信賴與希望、今已根本在動搖中、而十五年來、（即自華盛頓九國公約簽字以來）、吾國遠東政策各項主要原則、亦已遭受破壞、職是之故、美國政府除等待國聯會有所舉動之外自應另行有所作爲査九國公約原規定適當之行動方法、九國公約各簽字國會議、倘遭失敗、而各簽字國相互磋商之後、仍不能解决中日兩國糾紛、則該會議尙可提供其他切實方法、藉以討論各種可能措置、以使國際條約與和平、得有所保障、”惟民聲講壇報則仍謂、現當愼防威爾遜主義之復活云，（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國軍火</h3>
<p>蘇俄購最多　日購鐵最多</p>
<p>［華盛頓］本年九月份向美國購買軍火之國家、以蘇聯佔第一位、所購軍火、値一千八百餘萬美元有奇、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］據軍火管理局宣稱九月份蘇聯爲美國軍火之大買主、其總數達美金千餘萬元、半數以上乃購軍艦者、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］按之商務部所發表之統計、本年一月至八月份、美國輸往各國之廢鐵、業已超過歷年最高額、其中以輸往日本者爲最多、共達七三七、○○○噸、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>史蒂生與畢德門籲請各國共棄暴日</h3>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>從國際的同情說到我們的外交</h3>
<p>— 沈志遠</p>
<p>最近半月來、國際對我的同情、迅速地在增長起來；國際情勢的演變，愈見得有利於我們，這是有目共睹的事實。</p>
<p>從上月二十日起，日本空軍不顧一切公法正義，變本加厲大施轟炸我國首都及蘇，浙，粵，漢，贛等省重要都市的非戰鬥區域和無辜平民以來，全世界的輿論，都表示極度的憤慨、各國政府亦紛紛向暴日提嚴重抗議，反對日軍這種破壤條約公法和滅絕正義人道的暴行。特別令人感奮的，是各國民衆的反日運動，風起雲湧，再接再厲。英國各大報均一致主張抵制日貨。各種和平團體，尤其如威爾斯碾工聯合會，全英勞工委員會等工人團體，態度更爲激昂；他們均堅决要求抵制日貨，拒絕裝運貨物赴日，並主張以各種經濟壓力加諸日本，非至日軍完全退出中國不止。美國人民對日軍暴行，亦表示極度的憤恨。全國各界向政府呼籲制裁日本及發動抵制日貨運動的結果，逼得該國政府不但延緩實施中立法，而且一天比一天明顯地表示其同情我們斥責侵略的態度了。爲和平陣綫之柱石的法蘇兩國，其痛恨暴日，同情我國，更是昭然若揭。他們的政府和人民，都堅决一致主張制裁侵略。他如印度，澳州和南洋各地制日運動之普遍高漲，較之上列各大國實有過之無不及。</p>
<p>在這全世界制日運動普遍高漲的進程中，日內瓦的空氣也顯然有了進步。國聯大會於上月二十八日通過二十三國諮詢委員會的决議，對日本轟炸中國不設防城市，加以譴責。本月六日十三國小組委員會又對二十三國諮詢委員會之報告書成立結論，聲明日本侵犯中國，違反九國公約與非戰公約，六日國聯大會所通過之諮詢會决議案中，且主張予中國以援助，建議會員國不得採取削弱中國抵抗力量之任何行爲，並决定卽速開九國公約簽字國會議，進行調解。</p>
<p>此外，最値得我們重視的，是日前羅斯福總統在芝加哥發表的重要演說。在該演說中，羅總統鄭重指出“國際無政府狀態，如任其滋長而不加暹止，則美國或不免遭受攻擊，”又謂“洪水一旦暴發，美國不能倖免……孤立並不足爲避免牽入戰爭漩渦之保障。”總統於坦白直認孤立主義之不中用之後，更進而積極號召酷愛和平之各國人民共同努力，維持世界正義，將彼干犯世界正義之國家，予以“强制隔離”。（見五日國民社電）這一演說，我們佔定它爲美國遠東政策（乃至整個國際政策）急劇轉變的起點，恐怕不算過分吧。美國態度的這一明朗化，其影響於遠東國際的和平，自然頗爲重大。同時，這無疑地又是一個有利於我們抗戰前途的國際因素。</p>
<p>這樣看來，國際對我的同情，的確不斷地在增長；國際形勢的發展，的確愈變得有利於我們了。然而這種有利於我們的國際情勢，絕對不是等待出來的，像那班懶蛤蟆式的等待主義者所幻想一樣，而主要地是我們前綫浴血抗敵的將士的奮鬥出來的。正因爲這樣，所以我們今後仍無條件地需要繼續不斷的奮鬥，千百倍堅决地與敵搏鬥到底。國際形勢雖好，但是我們假如對它存了一絲一毫的依賴心，便足招致對抗戰前途的極大危害。須知國際形勢僅是我們抗戰的客觀條件，這種條件之有利與否，主要地是要靠我們自己去創造，去推動和改變的。而在這種創造，推動和改變的全部努力中。外交上的奮鬥。無疑地是異常重要的，有直接作用的一環。</p>
<p>但是我們要誠懇而坦白地指出，直到今日爲止，外交的奮鬥，始終是我們全面抗戰中極簿弱的一環。軍事的全面抗戰發動了已快兩個月，政府和最高領袖正式表示犧牲到底，抗戰到底，也快兩個月，但是我們的外交政策始終遠落於軍事抗戰之後。我們早就宣佈了焦。土。抗。戰。的决心，可是我們的外交，迄今距離焦土抗戰所要求的外交還相當的遠。</p>
<p>在這積外交與軍事“脫節”的狀况之下，要保障抗戰的最後勝利是很困難的。前面所述種種有利的國際情况，主要地固由於我們的堅决抗戰，但同時日軍襲本加厲的强暴獸行，亦係一大因素。當茲國際調解空氣日趨濃厚之時，假如我們不拿適合澈底抗戰的外交政策去應付，萬一敵人環觀形勢不妙而竟適可而止，那時我們的抗戰前途就有遭受嚴重打擊的可能。在眼前這時候，我們奮鬥的惟一大道，便是用“焦土外交”去配合“焦土抗戰”。我們的總目標是要使全面抗戰眞能長期支持下去，直到日本帝國主義完全驅逐出我大中華國土時爲止。</p>
<p>當然我們的“焦土外交”是跟前幾年敵人所倡的焦土外交完全不同的。日帝國主義的焦土外交是悍然不顧一切，用戰爭去威脅別國，以遂其侵略野心的一種强盜外交：我們的“焦土外交”是被壓迫者抱定破釜沉舟的决心，拿焦土抗戰做軸心以誓死爭取國家民族之獨立自由爲目的的一種革命外交，這種外交，本質上就是支持抗戰到底，保障最後勝利的必要手段。遵行中山先生遺囑，聯合以平等待我之民族，特別是蘇聯；促成太平洋集體安全制，以集體的和平力量制止侵略；反對任何喪權辱國的調解，但須竭力促進足以保障我領土主權之絕對完整和根本制止對我侵略行爲的一切“調解”。最後，我們要大聲疾呼地警告國人：假如我們不拿這種革命的“焦土外交”去支持抗戰到底，那末目前有利於我的國際情勢，恐怕不久會有轉變爲不利於我的危險啊！</p>

<p>離張家樓返西、以經至張家浜塘橋一帶察看、是時於細雨迷濛中、敵艦又開砲轟擊、砲彈掠空而過、刺刺有聲、而敵方三架重轟炸機、亦自東北方面飛來、當飛過我等頭頂時、不得不作相當之趨避、敵機週而復始、我等一行、亦躲避達三次之多、至張家浜、得悉浜南碼頭浜地方、墮一開花砲彈、炸倒民房一間、有三人受傷等情、記者卽隨擔架救護員、至目的地、將傷者三名一併扶臥架上抬歸、詢悉係父子三人、父名張全生、年三十六歲、炸傷腰部、長子名士根、年十六歲、炸傷頭部、次子阿多、炸傷面部、三人均無生命之虞、記者此行達十二里、沿途見聞所及、覺敵艦徒以大砲紛紛亂轟、消耗大量金錢、而其所得效果、則等於零耳、</p>
<h3>我空軍毀敵機兩架</h3>
<p>確息、五日晚我空軍來滬夜襲、在楊樹浦敵軍根據地先後投彈共計八妝、燃燒達一時餘、敵方損失甚為重大、其結果現已調査清楚者、卽當時在公大紗廠附近停有敵機多架、其中兩架確遭我機炸毀、</p>
<h3>敵機一架被我擊傷</h3>
<p>今晨七時、記者前往北區一帶視察、其時有敵機一架、盤旋於閘北之西北方、往返偵悉、至八時二十五分、記者由北向南、經過虞洽卿路上海煤氣公司時、突有該敵機一架由西向東飛來、其高度僅及五樓之屋頂、飛行之速、就機聲卽可知其已達極底、而尾部縷縷黃煙、向上直冒、必係中我之射擊受傷、急行飛歸原陣地者、該機為雙冀之轟炸機、其式作銀灰色、</p>
<p>今日上午八時三十分左右、西南方面有一敵軍重轟炸機、不知我何處駐軍擊中受重創、機之左翼已倒下經公共租界逃往楊諭浦方面而去、經滬時飛行極低、似已無力高飛矣、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>美總統羅斯福者芝加哥之演說。國聯大會通過中日案件。同時美國政府正式宣佈日本為侵略國。並違反修約行為。種種表示。曾博得舉世一致的同情。我們被侵略的國家。天然更為之感激興奮。</p>
<p>但是我們得到全世界一致的同情。完全是我們血和肉博得的代價。現在我們更應當以血和肉。報謝各國的盛意。將侵略主義者驅而出諸國防线以外。華北戰事的不爭氣。原屬無可諱言。但並非完全是敵人機械化步隊的成功。是我們的歷史上擁兵自衛遺跡之最后一頁。</p>
<p>世界各國雖對我國作同情的表示。但尚是意思的發動。而實行的進展尚在其後。我們更當積極抗戰。大舉反攻抱寗為玉碎不為瓦全之决心。立有敵無我有我無敵之志願。不犧牲是恥辱。不殺敵是懦怯。我們有一滴血當洒在敵人身上。有一粒彈當放在敵人頭顧。這就是我們報答全世界各國對我同情的微意。</p>

<h3>意大利靑年之動態</h3>
<p>— 許晚成</p>
<p>上海女中校長吳志　騫博士，日前由意大　利返國，與晚晤談·　茲將意國靑年之動態，節記一二如下，以　下皆吳氏言·—晚成附誌—</p>
<p>“意大利民族，昔日亦萎靡不振，自墨索利尼實施全民訓練後，民族氣象，日臻興奮，每星期六下午，為法西斯週（Sabato　Fascirta)，大中小學·一律停課，舉行軍事訓練；小學生負木槍操練，活潑壯健，中學生負眞槍操練，英氣勃勃，儼若軍隊，大學生實習戰鬥，若痴若狂，英勇萬狀，如臨大敵，致間有受傷者。</p>
<p>“意大利靑年，無論男女，身心均甚健美，患近視而載眼鏡者極少；</p>
<p>“意大利民族，極端崇拜英雄，對墨索利尼，極端信抑。而墨索利尼萬分注意訓練青年。常語人駢：“法西斯之生命，即在訓練有爲靑年。”至於對於中國之觀念，因彼邦極端崇拜英雄，初甚輕視，以爲中國人，中國靑年，俱屬無用之徒。自中國全面抗戰，予打擊者以打擊，尤以上海戰事，我軍浴血抗戰，意人頗爲驚駭。意國靑年與輿論界·由輕視與譏諷，一變而為尊敬與同情。强者生存·强權卽公理，於此證明矣！</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Officially Announces Japan's Aggression Violates Treaties</h3>
<p>Our government is gratified by the External Affairs Ministry's declaration today. The French Premier has already agreed, and the British Prime Minister will respond immediately. Roosevelt will convene a special session of Congress next month.</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. government today formally announced that Japan is an aggressor and is violating the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This means that the United States is fully backing the League of Nations. Following President Roosevelt's strong condemnation of countries that violate international law, the State Department issued a statement saying, "The United States has had to acknowledge that Japan's actions in China do not conform to the principles of international relations and violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg Pact." It is unprecedented for the United States to formally declare another country an aggressor and to violate peace treaties. Government officials believe that this action has fulfilled the meaning contained in President Roosevelt's speech. The President stated that peace-loving countries should take joint action to stop the threat of world war, and the United States will follow and support them. The State Department's statement was issued after the League of Nations resolved to convene a meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty, and its significance is very clear. However, the State Department also stated that the United States must wait for a formal invitation before deciding whether to participate in the meeting. As for the content of the State Department's statement, it briefly stated: "Since the dispute in the Far East, the U.S. government has strongly urged the Chinese and Japanese governments not to start a war and is willing to assist both parties in seeking a peaceful solution. Secretary of State Hull made two statements on July 16 and August 23, stating the position of the United States. The United States believes that the principles of international relations should strive to avoid the use of force and interference in other countries' internal affairs. International issues should be resolved peacefully, and the rights of other countries and the sanctity of treaties must be respected. On October 5, President Roosevelt further elaborated on this principle and solemnly declared that without universally observed laws and moral standards, there would be no peace and tranquility in the international community, and the international anarchy would destroy the foundation of peace. The security of all countries, large and small, will be jeopardized. Therefore, for the sake of the vital interests of its own people, the United States advocates that international treaties must be respected and international morality must be restored. The views of the U.S. government are largely the same as those of the League of Nations General Assembly." (October 6, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] President Roosevelt recently toured major cities in the country, covering a distance of 13,000 kilometers. He has now returned to Hyde Park from Chicago for a short rest and will return to Washington on the 8th of this month. Well-informed sources have recently stated that President Roosevelt intends to convene a special session of Congress next month to discuss the current serious international situation. (October 6, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] The president of the U.S. Naval Association, Hobart, told the Associated Press today that the United States should concentrate its entire fleet in Manila. This move would prevent Japan from engaging in aggressive military actions in the Far East. The United States should also cooperate with the United Kingdom and utilize the British naval bases in Singapore and Hong Kong. (October 7, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Chinese government is extremely gratified to hear that the U.S. State Department has issued a declaration denouncing Japan's aggression against China. Although the declaration was somewhat delayed, it is a substantial expression of the U.S. attitude and is sufficient to show that the United States has given the matter the most careful consideration. The Chinese side also expressed the hope that a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty can be realized as soon as possible, as this conference will certainly satisfy the desire of the peace-loving people of China and Japan to resolve the current disputes in accordance with the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, it is particularly strange that recent Italian public opinion has shown a tendency to side with Japan. (October 7, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] President Roosevelt's speech on the 5th, in which he strongly condemned the aggressor countries and hoped that all countries would take positive action, has aroused extraordinary sympathy and excitement in all quarters of our country. Political figures are particularly satisfied, saying that it can promote world peace and serve as a warning to aggressors. The full text of President Roosevelt's speech was delivered to our Foreign Affairs Ministry by the U.S. Embassy in China on the morning of the 7th. (October 7, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Premier Chautemps responded to President Roosevelt's speech today, agreeing to support any international action to stop the wars in China and Spain. (October 7, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Representatives of the American Expeditionary Forces are visiting here and were hosted by the American Club today. Premier Chautemps personally attended and gave a speech, briefly stating that President Roosevelt's speech the day before was in complete agreement with the main principles of French policy. He hoped that this speech would cause a "profound and lasting reaction" throughout the world. Premier Chautemps also stated, "The life of a nation should be based on respect for international law. Isolated actions are not only ineffective but also very dangerous. Only the common will and determination of peace-loving nations can stop aggression and prevent it from going beyond bounds. As for France, it will enthusiastically support any initiative aimed at close cooperation among peace-loving countries, and there is no need for further elaboration." (October 7, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos received U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Wilson this evening and told him that President Roosevelt's speech yesterday was in complete agreement with the principles of French policy. The French side was very pleased to hear this. French officials also said that President Roosevelt's speech was very important and that the President's intention was to pay special attention to the situation in Europe, followed by the situation in the Far East. The President's statement that "90 percent of the world's countries love peace, while 10 percent threaten all international laws and humanitarian principles, so the former must have control over the latter" means that although the United States cannot abandon its neutral position, the President intends to give as much support as possible to the efforts of peace-loving countries. In short, the international disputes are becoming more and more threatening, and all peace-loving democratic countries have gradually awakened and are trying to deal with them, which can be proved by President Roosevelt's speech.

<p>[London] The 64th annual conference of the Conservative Party opened in Scarborough this morning. Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to go there tomorrow to make a statement in response to President Roosevelt's diplomatic speech in Chicago the day before.

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Passes All Documents on Sino-Japanese Case</h3>
<p>Chairman to issue invitations for a Nine-Power Treaty conference.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly met at 5 p.m. today to discuss the resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The representatives of Norway and the Union of South Africa had requested a one-day adjournment at yesterday's General Assembly to seek instructions from their respective governments. After the meeting today, the representatives of those countries stated that they had received government instructions and decided to vote in favor. At this point, the General Assembly passed the draft resolution proposed yesterday by the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue by a unanimous vote (with only Poland and Siam abstaining) without debate. The Chairman, Indian representative Agha Khan, then declared that he would take all necessary measures in accordance with this resolution. The General Assembly also decided to adjourn without closing so that it could convene a meeting immediately when requested by the Advisory Committee. It then signed the invitations in accordance with the methods contained in the resolution in order to invite all member states that are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty to hold a meeting as soon as possible in accordance with Article 7 of the treaty. Of the member states of the League of Nations that are signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty, there are China, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the British Empire (including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Union of South Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and India). In addition, there are Bolivia, Denmark, Mexico, Norway, and Sweden, which have successively signed and joined the Nine-Power Treaty after its establishment. Therefore, the invitation letter from the Chairman of the General Assembly, Agha Khan, was issued to the governments of the above 17 countries. As for whether to invite the non-member countries of the United States and Japan, which are signatories, and the member state of the Soviet Union, which is not a signatory, will be decided by the above 17 countries. The meeting place will most likely be London. After signing the invitation letter, Chairman Agha Khan gave a brief speech to conclude, briefly stating: "The main issue at present is the issue of mankind and human dignity. The suffering of one nation must be felt by other nations. The weakening of one nation will inevitably lead to the weakening of other nations. Conversely, the progress of one nation will be the welfare of other nations. All of this is no longer an empty ideal, but a guiding principle that should be followed by the authorities of all countries and people of goodwill." (October 6, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, the U.S. State Department has recently issued a communiqué stating that the U.S. Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, recently telegraphed the State Department the second resolution passed by the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue at the League of Nations General Assembly and informed the State Department that the League of Nations General Assembly had also passed it this afternoon. (October 6, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wellington Koo Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>There is only one international moral standard, East and West.</p>
<p>[Geneva] Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of China to the League of Nations, today expressed his deep gratification at the U.S. State Department's denunciation of Japan as an aggressor, believing that it would strengthen the League of Nations' resolution against Japan. The U.S. State Department's declaration is also completely consistent with the conclusions reached by the League of Nations Advisory Committee after careful study of the facts. From this, it can be seen that there is only one international moral standard recognized by civilized countries in the world. Koo went on to say that if peace-loving countries want to enjoy the benefits of peace and security, they must re-establish the sanctity of treaty obligations through concerted action. In today's serious situation in the Far East and Western Europe, whether a second world war can be avoided depends on whether we can restore a cooperative life that seeks the welfare and civilization of mankind.

<h3>Britain and the United States Exchange Views</h3>
<p>Preparing for the Pacific Conference, location undecided between London and Washington.</p>
<p>[London] After the League of Nations General Assembly passed a resolution stipulating that a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty be convened, the British and American governments are now exchanging views in order to determine organizational issues, especially regarding the date and location of the meeting and the selection of attendees. British officials have recently stated that if the conference is held in Washington, the foreign ministers of European countries may not be able to attend in person and will be represented by their ambassadors to the United States. (October 7, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The date and location of the Pacific Conference are currently under discussion. It is estimated that the meeting will take place within two weeks at the earliest. As for the location of the meeting, London and Paris are certainly suitable, but the 1922 conference was held in Washington, so this cannot be ignored. Moreover, President Roosevelt's speech has made some quarters of the League of Nations consider that the meeting should be held in Washington. (October 7, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Official circles here today believe that President Roosevelt's speech and the U.S. State Department's remarks denouncing Japan as an aggressor are purely aimed at influencing the situation of the Nine-Power Treaty conference. It is reported that the British Cabinet has instructed Foreign Secretary Eden to immediately inquire with Washington about the degree of cooperation on the Far East situation. (October 7, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations has now issued a notice to the 17 member states that support the Nine-Power Treaty. If the United States, Russia, and Germany participate, the number can reach 20. Officials here all believe that the conference can be held in either London or Washington within three weeks. A spokesperson for the League of Nations expressed great satisfaction with the United States' actions, saying that although the United States has always adopted a detached attitude towards world events, it has now expressed its intention to cooperate closely with the League of Nations. (October 7, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy Does Not Intend to Participate in the Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>[Rome] It was learned here today that Italy will not participate in the Far East conference. Italy cannot accept any invitation from the League of Nations. Italy is currently resisting the League of Nations and will continue to do so until it recognizes the conquest of Abyssinia. According to official circles, Mussolini will never take anti-Japanese steps because Japan did not participate in the League of Nations' actions in the past. (October 7, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Has Flown to Moscow</h3>
<p>The military attaché has also returned home by plane.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to diplomatic sources, Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov was summoned by his government at the end of last month and flew back. He arrived safely in Moscow on the morning of the 5th. It is reported that the Soviet ambassador will return to his post as soon as he is publicly appointed and will not stay for long. (October 6, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is reported that Soviet Ambassador to China Bogomolov has flown to Moscow. The military attaché of the embassy, General Lebin, also flew to Moscow from Wuhu on Tuesday in a specially prepared plane. (October 7, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Unanimous World Opinion</h3>
<p>U.S. government officials discuss international cooperation as a good foundation for resolving serious problems.</p>
<p>[Washington] U.S. government officials told the Associated Press today that the near-unanimous passage of the resolution declaring Japan in violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact by the League of Nations General Assembly shows the unanimity of world opinion. This is a good foundation for the world's cooperation in dealing with the current serious problems. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has never advocated dealing with the situation on the narrow basis of the Nine-Power Treaty. The big problem of destroying international treaties and triggering a second world war is by no means a problem for a few countries, but a problem for all countries in the world. (October 6, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>First Batch of Medicines Shipped from England to China</h3>
<p>[London] The Chinese Purchasing Committee has arranged for a ton of medicines, including morphine, ether, tetanus antitoxin, gas analgesic, and iodine tincture, to be shipped to China on the P &amp; O liner Rajputana. The Chinese and British members of the committee will personally go to the riverside today to supervise the loading. This is the first batch of medicines to be shipped to China. The second batch will be shipped by Imperial Airways on Saturday and Sunday. (October 7, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The United States Continues to Create a New International Situation</h3>
<p>Peaceful nations can engage in effective cooperation, and Soviet Russian political circles express extreme satisfaction.</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, League of Nations officials recently commented that President Roosevelt's speech and the U.S. State Department's statement yesterday have made it possible for peace-loving countries to take effective concerted action and have created an opportunity for the success of the future Pacific Conference. Moreover, the State Department's statement indicates that the United States accepts the League of Nations' conclusions on the Sino-Japanese issue, so it is even more significant than Roosevelt's speech. Officials also said that President Roosevelt is now planning to send the full text of his speech in Chicago to the League of Nations Secretariat to express his agreement with the League of Nations. (October 7, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago is intended to change the U.S.'s isolationist policy in recent years. People here believe that this new policy of the President is related to the firm position adopted by Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. The U.S. fleet commander's protection of American expatriates in the Far East is now being praised. Although many Americans believe that neutrality and isolation are the best way to protect national interests, Admiral Yarnell's actions are based on the premise that the U.S. Navy and the country must not lose their prestige. The Washington Post commented today, praising President Roosevelt's speech, saying that some who are weak and cowardly and who believe that the United States sees no difference between brutal aggressors and innocent victims can now be permanently eliminated. The policy of neutrality, which is not justified, is obviously not applicable to the Sino-Japanese War because of the President's remarks. In short, the President has in fact warned Japan, Italy, and Germany that the United States not only passively hates such acts of aggression, but will also actively resist them. (October 6, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The U.S. State Department issued a statement yesterday condemning Japan's actions in China and expressing its acceptance of the League of Nations General Assembly's conclusions on the Sino-Japanese issue. British political figures attach great importance to this, considering it a new development in the international situation with significant implications. After this statement was issued, the United States' acceptance of participating in the conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty convened by the League of Nations is almost completely certain. In short, political figures believe that the U.S. State Department's statement is a step further than President Roosevelt's speech the day before, because it proves that the United States has decided to move from words to action. (October 7, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet political figures are extremely satisfied with President Roosevelt's speech yesterday. They pay particular attention to the explanation given by semi-official circles in Washington, which considers President Roosevelt's words to be an appeal to the countries concerned with the Pacific issue to take joint action to curb Japan's aggression. Soviet political figures also said that it is gratifying that the idea of peace is becoming more and more powerful. It is hoped that President Roosevelt's attitude will influence Britain and France, especially to make Britain abandon its current policy towards aggressors in the Far East and Europe. (October 6, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙New York The New York Times recently commented on President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago and the U.S. State Department's statement yesterday, advocating that a conference of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty be convened as soon as possible. The speech briefly stated: "The American people are extremely agitated about the events in the Far East. The United States should join other countries in considering ways to protect international law. Japan is deliberately sowing the seeds of destruction, and China has suffered the consequences. Our trust and hope for peace are now fundamentally shaken, and the main principles of our country's Far East policy for the past fifteen years (since the signing of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty) have also been destroyed. Therefore, the U.S. government should take action separately from waiting for the League of Nations to take action. The Nine-Power Treaty originally stipulated appropriate methods of action. If the conference of the signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty fails and the signatory countries still cannot resolve the dispute between China and Japan after mutual consultation, then the conference can provide other practical methods to discuss various possible measures to ensure that international treaties and peace are protected." However, the People's Forum still said that we should now be careful to prevent the revival of Wilsonianism. (October 6, Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Supplies</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union buys the most, Japan buys the most iron.</p>
<p>[Washington] The country that purchased the most military supplies from the United States in September of this year was the Soviet Union, with purchases exceeding $18 million. (October 7, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the Military Supplies Administration, the Soviet Union was the largest buyer of U.S. military supplies in September, with a total amount of more than ten million U.S. dollars, more than half of which was for the purchase of warships. (October 6, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce, the amount of scrap iron exported from the United States to various countries from January to August of this year has exceeded the highest amount in previous years, with the most exported to Japan, totaling 737,000 tons.

<h3>Stinson and Bitterman Urge All Countries to Abandon Violent Japan</h3>
<p>They Support Using "Quarantine" Methods to Stop the War; If Japan's Military Supplies are Cut Off, Aggression Will Certainly Lead to Despair</p>
<p>[Washington] Senator Bitterman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement here today calling on all countries in the world to abandon Japan, thereby forcing Japan to stop its barbaric war of destruction. Bitterman said that the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty can support President Roosevelt's "quarantine" of aggressor nations and isolate Japan. As for the U.S. neutrality law, Bitterman believes that it was not established for this kind of international crisis. The purpose of the neutrality law is to avoid the United States being drawn into the whirlpool of other countries' wars. Now, if we use "quarantine" methods to prevent the spread of war, we can succeed without resorting to war. It can be seen that Japan's invasion of China will stop within a month. The United States is the largest market for Japanese silk and the source of Japan's major military supplies. If the United States wants to cut off Japan's lifeline, there is no need to resort to war. All countries in the world only need to isolate Japan, refuse to interact with Japan, and stop commercial relations with Japan. Then, without a single soldier, Japan can be brought to justice. This action will be more powerful than the US army and navy because no country abandoned by the world can fight other countries again. (Sixth National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] Former U.S. Secretary of State Stinson published a letter in the New York Times today, calling on the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate and use economic pressure to force Japan to stop its aggression against China. However, he does not advocate that the United States send troops to the Far East to fight, believing that this move would be detrimental to the overall situation. From the current situation, China's urgent need is not foreign aid, but that other countries no longer assist its powerful enemy. The bravery and combat effectiveness of the Chinese army are known to the world. If the military supplies of China and Japan are no longer so disparate, Japan's actions will inevitably lead to despair. For the sake of the safety of the United Kingdom and the United States, how can we continue to assist Japan in destroying the heroic Chinese army? Those who advocate neutrality vainly think that they can use the talisman of the neutrality law to avoid being caught in the vortex. In fact, neutrality is enough to make us even more unable to avoid being drawn into the vortex. Therefore, the U.S. government should resolutely decide to assist the League of Nations again. (Seventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] Former U.S. Secretary of State Stinson, the initiator of the "Manchukuo" non-recognition doctrine, recently sent a letter to the New York Times, advocating that the United States should cooperate with the League of Nations to stop the Sino-Japanese war and, together with the United Kingdom, prohibit the supply of raw materials to Japan's military industry. He also fully agrees with President Roosevelt's speech on the 5th and the communique issued by the State Department, saying, "The responsibility that the United States should bear in the current crisis will surely restore its former courage and resolutely shoulder it. All countries that dare to face various problems and strive to solve them, our State Department should cooperate with them without hesitation." Even if the United States adopts a passive attitude, it cannot avoid war. As for the neutrality law, it is an immoral act that will eventually drag the United States into the whirlpool of war. For the current plan, the United Kingdom and the United States must refuse to supply raw materials to Japan's military industry. Although we do not advocate military intervention in the Sino-Japanese dispute, this is not to say that "the United States can only take a passive, shameful, and passive attitude of watching." President Roosevelt's remarks yesterday are exactly the same as the principle of the late President Roosevelt's, "We would rather sacrifice everything than sacrifice honor." Unfortunately, we had previously reversed this principle. As a result, we have no way to maintain world peace, and we cannot avoid endangering our own peace.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Explains Continental Policy</h3>
<p>Not Hesitating to Use War to Plunder Resources; Will Not Attend the Nine-Power Treaty Countries Conference</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with foreign journalists this afternoon and expressed satisfaction with the abstention of representatives from Poland and Siam when the Twenty-Three-Nation Sino-Japanese Consultative Committee voted on the 5th. Secondly, in response to the New York Times' editorial on the 4th, which commented that his statement that the responsibility for the Shanghai challenge lay with China was empty talk, he read out a rebuttal statement, saying that before the Chinese side started the war, it had secretly informed foreigners and Chinese to withdraw east of the Suzhou River on the 13th, which was evidence of the challenge. Regarding the rumors that the Japanese fleet concentrated in Shanghai before the war, he argued that this was to protect Japanese expatriates in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River who were returning home. When reporters from various countries asked about the number of Japanese warships and dispatched naval landing forces at that time, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied all the rumors. Finally, he issued a written criticism of President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago, saying that the world was created for mankind, and all honest and diligent citizens have the right to live happily and enjoy life anywhere. But if there are lazy people who rely on past savings to live their happy lives, and honest and diligent citizens are denied survival, what is more unfair than this? If there is injustice, there will be cries. Therefore, the essence of politics lies in eliminating injustice, whether domestic or international. In the past fifty years, Japan's population has doubled, and it has been rejected in seeking development outside its narrow islands. Now there is a dispute between countries with resources and countries without resources in the world. The unfair distribution of resources and raw materials is rife. If this is not corrected, and countries with resources unite to refuse to give up their vested rights to countries without resources, is there any way to solve the problem other than war? However, the Japanese people do not demand this as a right, but only demand that the diligent and honest Japanese people, because the country was created for mankind, have full qualifications to enjoy a happy life in the world. If President Roosevelt's speech is concerned with the China Incident, it can be applied to the current problems occurring in the East. What was said above is that Japan seeks peaceful development on the mainland, seeks peaceful development with China, and seeks peaceful cooperation with China, but China refuses with force, resulting in today's incident, etc. This is the most blatant statement made by Japan to the outside world since the incident. It boldly reveals its continental policy, or is called a bomb declaration, which is very noteworthy. (Central News Agency, Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan has not yet received an invitation to the Pacific Conference of the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries convened by the League of Nations, but it has informally stated that it will not attend. It has also informally expressed its views on the US State Department's statement on the 6th, saying that Japan's attitude, when it last replied to US Secretary of State Hull's statement, had stated that it wanted to apply the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-War Treaty to the situation in the Far East, but its understanding was insufficient. The so-called principle of changed circumstances can only properly handle everything between China and Japan. Therefore, it is not the time to apply the two treaties. (Central News Agency, Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago has given Japan a great shock. A telegram from Washington on the morning of the 7th stated that the United States has formally determined that Japan's actions violate the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Non-War Treaty, which is particularly noteworthy. The Asahi Shimbun's editorial on the morning of the 7th said that because it is eager to criticize war, it does not examine the causes of war, which is very regrettable. If the United States wants to obtain the right to speak in the Far East, it should strictly adhere to neutrality to be qualified, etc. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun's editorial also strongly attacked it, saying that the Chicago speech is not commensurate with Roosevelt's peaceful political observation. It is difficult for Japan to establish peace in East Asia without eliminating the anti-Japanese regime in China, and to carry out the economic development of the mainland, which is inseparable from the survival rights of the Japanese people, etc. After the incident, Japan's arguments were quite perfunctory to the United States, but now it has changed. (Central News Agency, Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to send Ito Nobushi, former ambassador to Poland, to Shanghai to explain Japan's position on the China Incident to the diplomatic representatives of European and American countries stationed in Shanghai. It is reported that Ito will depart for Shanghai within days. (Daimon News Agency, Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. "Peace Groups" Are Still Making Trouble</h3>
<p>[Washington] Six U.S. peace groups commented on President Roosevelt's speech today, saying, "The president is now leading the American people to a world war, which is no different from what President Wilson did in 1917. We acknowledge that treaties must be observed, but we cannot use war or any joint action that could lead to war to compel compliance." (Sixth National Telegram)</p>

<h3>From International Sympathy to Our Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhiyuan</p>
<p>In the past half month, international sympathy for us has been rapidly increasing; the evolution of the international situation has become more and more favorable to us. This is a fact that is obvious to all.</p>
<p>Since the 20th of last month, the Japanese air force, regardless of all public laws and justice, has intensified its bombing of the non-combat areas and innocent civilians in the important cities of our capital and Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The world's public opinion has expressed extreme indignation, and the governments of various countries have also lodged serious protests to violent Japan, opposing the Japanese military's acts of destroying treaty public laws and exterminating justice and humanity. What is particularly inspiring is that the anti-Japanese movements of the people of various countries have sprung up like mushrooms and are continuing unabated. Major British newspapers have unanimously advocated boycotting Japanese goods. Various peace groups, especially labor groups such as the Wells Miners' Union and the All-England Labor Committee, have taken an even more激昂 attitude. They have all firmly demanded boycotting Japanese goods, refusing to load goods to Japan, and advocated imposing various economic pressures on Japan until the Japanese military completely withdraws from China. The American people have also expressed extreme indignation at the Japanese military's atrocities. The result of the appeals to the government from all walks of life across the country to sanction Japan and launch a boycott of Japanese goods has forced the U.S. government not only to delay the implementation of the neutrality law, but also to express its sympathy for us and condemn aggression more and more clearly day by day. France and the Soviet Union, the cornerstones of the peace front, have even more clearly revealed their hatred of violent Japan and their sympathy for our country. Their governments and people are firmly united in advocating sanctions against aggression. The widespread rise of the anti-Japanese movement in India, Australia, and various parts of Southeast Asia is even more significant than the major countries listed above.</p>
<p>In the course of this widespread rise in the global anti-Japanese movement, the atmosphere in Geneva has also obviously improved. On the 28th of last month, the League of Nations General Assembly passed the resolution of the Twenty-Three-Nation Consultative Committee, condemning Japan's bombing of undefended Chinese cities. On the 6th of this month, the Thirteen-Nation Sub-Committee reached a conclusion on the report of the Twenty-Three-Nation Consultative Committee, declaring that Japan's invasion of China violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Non-War Treaty. The resolution of the Consultative Committee passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on the 6th also advocated providing China with assistance, suggested that member states not take any actions that would weaken China's resistance, and decided to immediately convene a conference of the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries to conduct mediation.</p>
<p>In addition, what we value most is President Roosevelt's important speech in Chicago the other day. In that speech, President Roosevelt solemnly pointed out that "if international anarchy is allowed to grow without stopping it, the United States may not be spared from attack," and also said that "once the flood breaks out, the United States cannot escape... Isolation is not enough to guarantee avoidance of being drawn into the whirlpool of war." After frankly admitting that isolationism is useless, the president further actively called on the people of all countries who love peace to work together to maintain world justice and to "forcibly isolate" the countries that violate world justice. (See the National News Agency Telegram on the 5th) It would probably not be an exaggeration for us to determine that this speech is the starting point for a dramatic change in the United States' Far East policy (and even its entire international policy). The clarification of the United States' attitude will naturally have a significant impact on international peace in the Far East. At the same time, this is undoubtedly another international factor that is beneficial to our prospects for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>In this way, international sympathy for us is indeed constantly increasing; the development of the international situation is indeed becoming more and more favorable to us. However, this favorable international situation is absolutely not waiting to come out, as those lazy toad-style waitingists fantasize, but is mainly fought out by the soldiers who are fighting the enemy with their blood on the front line. Precisely because of this, we still unconditionally need to continue to fight unceasingly in the future, and fight the enemy to the end a thousand times more resolutely. Although the international situation is good, if we have a trace of dependence on it, it will be enough to cause great harm to the prospects for the war of resistance. It must be known that the international situation is only the objective condition for our war of resistance. Whether this condition is favorable or not mainly depends on our own efforts to create, promote, and change it. And in all the efforts of this creation, promotion, and change. Diplomatic struggle. Undoubtedly, it is an unusually important and directly effective link.</p>
<p>But we must sincerely and frankly point out that until today, diplomatic struggle has always been an extremely weak link in our overall war of resistance. The overall military war of resistance has been launched for almost two months, and the government and the supreme leader have officially expressed their determination to sacrifice to the end and resist to the end for almost two months, but our diplomatic policy has always lagged far behind the military war of resistance. We have long declared our scorched earth resistance war, but our diplomacy is still quite far from the diplomacy required by the scorched earth resistance war.</p>
<p>Under this situation of "disconnection" between diplomacy and military affairs, it is very difficult to guarantee the final victory of the war of resistance. The various favorable international situations mentioned above are mainly due to our resolute war of resistance, but at the same time, the increasingly intensified violent atrocities of the Japanese military are also a major factor. When the atmosphere of international mediation is becoming more and more intense, if we do not deal with it with a diplomatic policy suitable for a thorough war of resistance, in case the enemy looks at the situation badly and ends it at the right time, then our prospects for the war of resistance may suffer a serious blow. At this moment, our only great way to fight is to use "scorched earth diplomacy" to match "scorched earth resistance." Our overall goal is to ensure that the overall war of resistance can truly be sustained for a long time until Japanese imperialism is completely expelled from our great Chinese territory.</p>
<p>Of course, our "scorched earth diplomacy" is completely different from the scorched earth diplomacy advocated by the enemy in the past few years. The scorched earth diplomacy of Japanese imperialism is a bandit diplomacy that brazenly disregards everything, uses war to threaten other countries, and attempts to achieve its aggressive ambitions: our "scorched earth diplomacy" is a revolutionary diplomacy that the oppressed hold a resolute determination to cut off the boat and take scorched earth resistance as the axis to vow to fight for the independence and freedom of the country and the nation. This diplomacy is essentially a necessary means to support the war of resistance to the end and guarantee the final victory. Follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, unite with nations that treat us equally, especially the Soviet Union; promote a collective security system in the Pacific to stop aggression with collective peace power; oppose any mediation that sacrifices sovereignty and humiliates the country, but must strive to promote all "mediations" that can guarantee the absolute integrity of our territorial sovereignty and fundamentally stop aggressive acts against us. Finally, we must loudly warn the people of the country: if we do not use this revolutionary "scorched earth diplomacy" to support the war of resistance to the end, then the international situation that is currently favorable to us may soon change to a danger that is unfavorable to us!</p>
<h3>The Midnight Silence of Shanghai is Broken, and the Artillery Battle on the Huangpu River is Extremely Fierce</h3>
<p>Our Army's Accurate Artillery Fire, Many Shots Hit; The Remaining Enemies on the South Bank of the Yunzaobing are Cleared; The Chinese Army in Zhabei Killed More Than 100 Enemies This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, it rained all day, and the mobility of enemy aircraft, artillery, and tanks was significantly reduced. Our army took the opportunity to launch a counterattack on the entire front, and all made progress. The main force of the enemy troops who had been attacking our Shixianggong Temple west of Luodian and Caowang Temple northwest of Luodian for days was severely beaten by us, leaving corpses all over the field and fleeing in embarrassment. At the same time, the enemy east of Guangfu Town also retreated to the highway and did not dare to go out easily. As for the enemy who secretly crossed the Yunzaobing on the 6th, after a day and night of encirclement and interception by our fresh troops, most of them have been wiped out. A few remaining enemies are still trying to resist stubbornly and are currently being closely searched, and they can all be wiped out. The enemy ships in the Huangpu River continued to bombard our positions in Pudong yesterday, and we also returned fire. From 11:30 last night, the artillery battle gradually intensified, and the rumbling sound shook the entire Shanghai. Citizens were awakened from their sleep, and the area near the Bund was filled with smoke and sulfur. The most intense period was between 11:50 and 12:10, with an average of dozens of shots fired per minute by both sides, and sometimes several shots were fired at the same time. Looking from the Bund, only fireballs and flashes of light were seen flying. Our heavy artillery team fired extremely accurately, and many shells landed near the enemy ships, and several shells emitted extremely crisp explosions. It is estimated that they have hit the key parts of the enemy ships. The artillery fire stopped at 12:15, and started again at 20 minutes, and the battle was temporarily silent at 12:50. Since the start of the battle, the enemy ships have been constantly bombarding Pudong aimlessly. They have neither been able to cover the landing of the enemy troops nor have they been able to destroy any of our fortifications. At most, they have destroyed a few houses and injured a few civilians. The waste of ammunition is enough to expose their military immaturity. It is truly the most unconscious act.</p>
<p>Wounded prisoner Gang Chunyi, according to the prisoner, was shot down and captured by our aircraft in the airspace over Jianqiao, Hangzhou on August 15. At that time, his right leg was seriously injured. After being treated by the Central Hospital, he underwent a leg amputation surgery. He stayed in the first-class ward of the hospital for nearly a month before he recovered. The total cost of medical and surgical expenses was more than 500 yuan. The situation of our country's preferential treatment of prisoners can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>The Remaining Enemies on the South Bank of the Yunzaobing Were Quickly Cleared After Being Severely Eliminated by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Most Were Eliminated Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 10 pm on the 7th that the enemy who crossed the river from Yunzaobing on the 6th had been mostly wiped out by our army after a day and night of fierce attacks by the morning of the 7th. From the evening of the 6th to the morning of the 7th, the enemy repeatedly attempted to continue to cross the river secretly, but were all repelled by our army. Currently, our army is clearing the remaining enemies who crossed the river.</p>
<p>A spokesman for our army said that the enemy's attempt to forcibly cross the Yunzaobing between Tangqiao and Liufangzhai at the eastern end of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway has been repelled by our army and more than 100 of them have been annihilated. Then, under the cover of intense artillery fire, the enemy forcibly crossed the river again. Our reinforcements have arrived to block them strictly, encircling and intercepting them.</p>
<p>The enemy troops who secretly crossed the Yunzaobing at Dongyangzhai the previous morning were strictly blocked by the guards of Yanjiawan. After a day of fierce fighting, the troops crossing the river at Jiangjiazai seemed to echo the troops crossing the river at Tangqiao (highway bridge), and crossed the river at the same time at 3 pm the day before yesterday. Our side has sent powerful troops to reinforce and intercept them, and the fierce fighting has continued all night until morning.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Zhabei is Advancing Without Retreating</h3>
<p>The Enemy Attacking Baziqiao Was Defeated After Being Attacked by Us; Our Army Won the Counterattack in Guangdong Street and Other Places</p>
<p>Fleeing in Embarrassment After Attacking Baziqiao</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 2 pm on the 7th that at 4 am this morning, after the enemy bombarded our Baziqiao positions with artillery, three enemy tanks covered more than 200 infantrymen and attacked us. Our army held the inherent positions west of Yokohama and confronted the enemy. At the same time, another part of the force was transferred to attack the enemy's flanks from Liuying Road. Under the pincer attack of our army, the enemy barely supported for an hour, with more than 50 soldiers killed or wounded, and then fled in embarrassment under the cover of their tanks. Our army took advantage of the situation to pursue, intercepted more than 10 rifles and light machine guns, and then returned to its original position.</p>
<p>Our Army's Counterattack Forces the Enemy to Retreat</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent accompanying the army reported at 2 pm on the 7th that at 3 am this morning (the 7th), our army launched a counterattack from Guangdong Street, Qiujiang Road, Baoyuan Road, and Dongbaoxing Road respectively to test the enemy's strength. The results were very satisfactory. After more than 30 enemies were killed in close combat, the outposts were chased back. The enemy tanks could not withstand the threat of our flat-fire guns and also covered their infantry to retreat. The enemy also bombarded us randomly with flat-fire guns, aiming to destroy our buildings, but our army remained calm and was never threatened by them. At 7 am, the enemy bombarded the rear of our positions with artillery again, and many shells landed on Gonghe Road and Baoshan Road, but our army ignored them. Enemy planes also came out once and dropped a few bombs, but then disappeared due to the heavy rain.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Fierce Attack on Xiaopanzhai on the Luodian Front Was Defeated</h3>
<p>More Than 500 Enemies Were Annihilated Before and After by Us; Enemy Artillery Bombed for 38 Hours</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent, reported on the 7th afternoon on return to the agency from the front lines of Shixianggong Temple; our troops moved back after enemy forces breached our front line positions in Luodian, firmly defended Shixianggong Temple, and the left wing held Xiaopanzhai, approximately 1.5 kilometers north of the Jiabao Highway in Luodian; the area is situated approximately two kilometers northwest of Luodian, projecting northeast from Shixianggong Temple, serving as a vital stronghold. The enemy initially attacked our frontal positions, but, following our flank attacks, shifted their focus to launching a fierce assault on the village.</p>
<p>Our Army Charges, Engaging in Hand-to-Hand Combat</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th, a portion of the enemy forces, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched an attack on the village; our army immediately engaged them, and in order to avoid the threat of enemy artillery fire, all leaped out of the trenches, advanced forward, and charged into the enemy ranks, fiercely attacking with bayonets; after two hours of intense combat, they annihilated the enemy forces. As our troops advanced for inspection, they recovered two small villages nearby. Many enemy soldiers used armored breastplates to protect their chests; as a result, many of our army's bayonets were bent or broken; on this day (the 7th), at dawn, enemy aircraft were dispatched, dropping numerous bombs within our positions; subsequently, a small number of enemy troops made provocative movements in front of our positions, but upon seeing our troops charge, they immediately collapsed and retreated.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Launched Up to Eleven Attacks</p>
<p>The enemy forces launched up to eleven attacks on the area on the 6th, but were all repelled by us; we also launched five attacks; the enemy forces in the area consisted of the Taiwan garrison, approximately one division in strength, including the 42nd, 44th, and 60th Regiments; however, more than 500 of them have already been annihilated by us; each battle resulted in the enemy forces collapsing and retreating in disarray after being engaged in a charge of close combat, with many bodies left on our positions because they could not be moved; according to our inspection of their insignia, Major Nakata, Captain Chida, Captain Batai of the Engineering Corps, Lieutenant Yamaguchi, and Warrant Officers Nishizono and Arita were identified, and five light machine guns, 120 rifles, swords, diaries, and many other items were captured. The diaries revealed widespread unwillingness towards the war.</p>
<p>Enemy Artillery Bombed for 38 Hours</p>
<p>Yesterday, fierce battles continued in three areas: northwest of Luodian, directly west of Liuhang, and along the coast of the Yunzaobing; in order to implement their central breakthrough plan, the enemy has continuously attacked the Jiading-Luodian highway, but following our heroic interception, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and therefore, disregarded public law and humanity, and recklessly used poison gas; moreover, enemy aircraft were unusually active, dropping bombs with unprecedented intensity, but their targets were all behind our positions, and therefore, our defensive fortifications were not damaged; the enemy's artillery bombardment has been uninterrupted for the past 38 hours; our troops, under the intense artillery fire, still held their original positions; the enemy's plan to break through our original front lines by the 10th of this month is unlikely to materialize.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces in Guangfu Town Have Been Cleared</h3>
<p>The enemy forces entrenched and stubbornly defending the east of Guangfu Town, near Liuhang, have been blocked by us and are unable to advance further; the day before yesterday, after our army bombarded the enemy with heavy artillery, we launched a large-scale sweep; the Japanese pirates were routed at the mere sight of us and have retreated to the east of Dixing, stubbornly resisting along the highway line by relying on small rivers; our army has searched the surrounding area and all enemy forces have been cleared.</p>
<h3>One Enemy Plane Shot Down by Us Northeast of Dachang Airport</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 4:50 PM on the 7th that enemy planes had been active over our military positions since dawn. At 7:30 AM, an enemy reconnaissance plane was flying low near Dachang Airport for reconnaissance purposes. It was hit by our forces and crashed near Daliujiazhai, northeast of Dachang Airport. The plane was a Type 95 seaplane, marked with the number 22. The pilot was killed, and the fuselage was not severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Izumo Leads Six Warships to the Mouth of the Songjiang River</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday (the 7th) at 7:30 AM, the enemy flagship Izumo, originally anchored at the No. 2 buoy in the Huangpu River, suddenly led six enemy warships, a portion of the fleet originally anchored within the Huangpu, passing Yangshupu Wharf around 8:00 AM and heading towards the mouth of the Wusong River. The intention is unknown.</p>
<p>The enemy flagship Izumo, around 7:00 AM, led several gunboats to the Jiangmian River surface off Yangshupu for a temporary stop, and then shelled our Pudong and Zhabei Jiangwan areas. However, due to heavy fog, the targets were unclear, so they soon sailed downstream.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Commander Killed in Action</h3>

<h3>Reinforcements Arrive on the Jinpu Railway Line, We Launch a Counteroffensive North of Dezhou</h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Continue in Northern Shanxi; Enemy Forces Attack Guoxian from Three Sides; Reports Indicate that Enemy Forces on All Fronts in North China Will Halt Their Advance</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In the Jinpu Railway battle, our fresh troops have reinforced and are currently launching a counteroffensive north of Dezhou. In addition to personally going to the front lines to supervise the battle, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, has specially sent Zhang Yue, a member of the Shandong Provincial Government, to Nanjing to meet with the highest military authorities, report on the war situation, and make requests. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Zhang Yue, a member of the Shandong Provincial Committee, arrived in Beijing by train from Jinan and met with Minister of the Army He on the same evening to report. Zhang represented Chairman Han in reporting on the situation of the war of resistance in northern Shandong, as well as Han's presence at the front lines to supervise the battle, which boosted morale. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The front lines were quiet this morning. Our forces and the enemy are still facing each other across the old Yellow River. Our guerrillas appear behind enemy lines at night, causing great panic among the enemy. Eight enemy planes intruded into the area between Taian and Jieshou this morning, dropping fifteen bombs and bombing the Jinpu Railway Bridge. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Bengbu] Three enemy planes flew to the Jiajiang Station on the Jinpu Railway around 10:00 AM on the 7th and dropped six bombs. At the same time, three enemy planes were also spotted in Shuanggotun in northern Lingbi. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The enemy at Yuanping launched three fierce attacks on the night of the 5th, all of which were repelled by us. However, the sound of artillery fire did not cease throughout the night. At dawn on the 6th, the enemy increased its forces several times and launched an assault on the three battalions of our Gu Tuan, attempting to break through. Our troops calmly responded and waited for the enemy to advance to within thirty meters before ceasing fire. A bayonet melee ensued, a close-quarters battle of unprecedented intensity. The fierce fighting continued until around 7:00 AM, when the enemy finally retreated in defeat. The battlefield was littered with corpses, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties, several times greater than ours. Our positions remained unmoved, and the morale of the officers and soldiers was high, with everyone determined to defend their positions to the death. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The enemy troops harassing Xuangangzhen increased by four or five hundred men on the morning of the 6th and launched a fierce attack on us, with a portion attempting to outflank us on the left wing. Fierce fighting is currently underway. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Approximately two thousand enemy soldiers at Guoxian, carrying over twenty artillery pieces, launched a three-sided siege on our side on the morning of the 6th, using artillery fire as cover to gradually approach our positions, attempting to construct fortifications. At 3:00 PM, the enemy artillery heavily bombarded the positions of our Liu Tuan. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely, but the enemy artillery was too intense and completely destroyed the Tuan's positions. All officers and soldiers of the Tuan were martyred. Fierce fighting is still underway with our reinforcements. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A Haitong telegram from Tianjin on the 7th stated that reports indicate that the Japanese army on all front lines in North China will halt their advance. The Japanese headquarters here explained that this was based on actual needs, as it was necessary to reorganize the forward combat units and consolidate the rear communications before continuing to advance, so that reinforcements could continue to arrive. However, because the Japanese army's front lines are far from their operational bases, there are many gaps in between, and how to fill them has become an extremely difficult problem. Their success or failure in North China depends on this point. In practical terms, the area and population of each province in China are at least equal to those of a large, densely populated European country, but railway and highway transportation is lacking. Therefore, the further the Japanese army advances, the greater its difficulties and dangers. So-called deep incursions cannot be regarded as victories. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<h3>Extermination of Humanity - Enemy Planes Bomb Everywhere</h3>
<p>The Victims Are All Civilians; Poison Gas Bombs Discovered in Dongguan</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Enemy planes attacked Guangdong on the 7th. As of the time the reporter sent the dispatch, there had been three attacks. The first was at 8:55 AM, when sixteen enemy planes took off from Tangjiawan and Yamen, bombing along the Yuehan Railway line. Six planes intruded into the city area. Our squadron intercepted them in the eastern suburbs, and the battle was fierce. The enemy only dropped over a dozen bombs outside the eastern suburbs and then fled. They randomly dropped three bombs in Huangpu, which landed on civilian houses, burning down seventeen villagers' homes and causing over sixty casualties. Rescue efforts are underway. The Yuehan Railway was bombed in three places, with a section of track between Xiamao and Jiangcun destroyed, approximately ten or more zhang in length. The second attack was at 11:00 AM, when twelve enemy planes in two groups attacked Conghua and Huangpu, dropping three bombs. They then intruded into the eastern suburbs of the city and dropped another three bombs. It is reported that the enemy has occupied Hobaodao, near the Lianwan and Zhiqun Islands, and built an airfield, with over six hundred marines stationed there. It appears that the enemy planes in this attack were land-based planes and took off from that island. The third attack was at 2:13 PM. According to reports, thirteen enemy planes were flying directly from Tangjiawan to the Huangpu River, carrying out their acts of slaughter. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The enemy planes launched their third attack on Guangdong in the afternoon of the 7th, a total of thirteen planes, flying from Hobaodao to Shaoguan and dropping over a dozen bombs, before returning near Yingde.

After investigation, it was found that two bombs landed in the water and one landed in the wilderness. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Suzhou] Extent of the damages in Changshu: At 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, three enemy warships fired three shells outside Hupukou, which landed in Sanjiaozhen, destroying only a few civilian houses. At the same time, the enemy warships launched a small motorboat carrying over forty soldiers, attempting to land, but seeing that our defenses were tight, they quickly left. At 7:00 AM this morning, two enemy planes flew to Changshu and dropped five bombs in Fushan before flying away, killing two farmers and injuring seven, and destroying over a dozen houses. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang] A telegram from Wuxi on the 6th reported that at 1:00 PM, eight enemy planes attacked Wuxi, dropping over twenty bombs in the vicinity of the station and in the urban areas of the city, destroying many houses and setting several places on fire. The casualties are awaiting investigation. At the same time, the vicinity of Shitangwan Station was also bombed, with unknown losses. Also, at 3:00 PM on the 6th, over ten enemy planes attacked Nanjing. After being severely attacked and dispersed by our planes, four planes fled to Yangzhou and dropped over ten bombs. Our losses are awaiting investigation. Six planes attacked Jurong, using machine guns to strafe, causing no damage. Five planes flew to Qilidian in Zhenjiang for reconnaissance and then fled eastward. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Several enemy planes were spotted over a certain county in southern Jiangxi at around 11:00 AM on the 7th, flying from south to north, with unknown intentions. They did not leave Jiangxi until 1:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Changsha] At 12:30 PM on the 7th, five enemy planes were spotted in the Zixing area, flying along the railway line towards Chenzhou. They dropped five bombs at Loufengdu, three of which landed in the water and two near the railway, causing no losses. They were chased away by our planes. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] On September 27th, six enemy planes flew to the Dongguan county area outside the Humen Fortress, circled for a moment, and then dropped bombs. The bombs landed in areas where civilians were concentrated. After the bombs exploded, nearby residents immediately felt a noxious odor, followed by dizziness and weakness in their limbs, indicating that the enemy planes had dropped poison gas bombs at that time. Since the start of the war of resistance, enemy planes have bombed our cities, residents, shops, and cultural and charitable institutions everywhere. Now, they are violating international law even further by dropping poison gas bombs. Their cruelty and wickedness are simply inhuman. However, such barbaric acts by the enemy only strengthen our determination to resist. In order to seek national survival and uphold human justice, we are determined to fight the enemy to the end.

Twenty girl scouts from the Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps were assigned to collect the donations, and Xiang Sheng Taxi Company voluntarily dispatched seven cars for the collection. As a result, cash donations to date have exceeded 10,000 yuan, and many other items, such as cotton vests, have been received. There is also a collection of antiques, calligraphy, and paintings that have been donated for sale at a fixed price. All detailed accounts are currently being sorted out by the association and will be announced on the original radio station and disclosed in advertisements in various newspapers within a few days, as well as thanking all parties.</p>
<p>In addition, the association is currently raising funds to manufacture 100,000 cotton vests in accordance with the sizes specified by the Ministry of Military Affairs, to be worn inside military uniforms and transported to the front lines by the Double Tenth Festival, so as to maintain the neatness and solemnity of the military while providing protection against the cold.

<h3>The Weaknesses of the Japanese Army Invading Shanghai Are Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>Fair Criticism by Military Experts from Various Countries: Japan Is No Longer Worthy of Being Called a First-Class Power</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 5th reported that various newspapers here quoted a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 3rd as saying that military experts from the United States and other countries observing the war in Shanghai believe that the world's major powers no longer need to worry about Japan's military might, let alone the United States. Some even believe that Japan is no longer worthy of being called a first-class power. One military expert claimed that "Western countries all regarded Japan as a major threat, especially the United States. Now, this paper tiger has been torn apart." An aviation expert believes that one hundred of the United States' excellent bombers and fifty fighters could wipe out all Japanese planes in the Shanghai area within a week. Another officer said that Japan's excessive underestimation of the enemy was a major mistake. Today, the Japanese army should know that the Chinese army is no longer the disorganized force of the past. China has suffered serious losses due to insufficient military equipment, but Japan has deployed half of its navy, more than half of its air force, and more than 120,000 troops, yet it has still been unable to break China's resistance. The most prominent weaknesses exposed by Japan in the Shanghai battles are the poor naval artillery combat skills and its inability to deploy a combined forward barrage attack, coupled with the weakness of its air force capabilities. According to observers, the Japanese navy has 700 cannons, ranging in caliber from three to eight inches, but it has taken more than a month, with the help of infantry bombers, to force Chinese infantry to retreat from coastal positions to new defense lines. The Japanese are inaccurate in their shooting and often miss completely after acquiring their targets. Such examples are abundant. However, observers believe that in fair criticism, the Japanese army and navy in Shanghai may not be the elite of the Japanese army, while the Chinese troops they are facing are disciplined and resolutely united.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Japanese Army's Combat Units in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Total Number Reaches More Than 156,000</p>
<p>The composition and strength of the enemy's combat units in Shanghai have attracted much attention. The following is the information obtained by the Dagong Daily reporter from relevant sources: The units in the Luodian area are the Anda Detachment, the units in the Liuhang area are the Tanoue Detachment, and the units in the Hongkou North Sichuan Road area are the Sano Detachment (whose commander, Konishi Kuro, has already been killed in action). The units in the Jiangwan area are the Nagatsu Detachment. In addition, there are the Wachi, Momoi, Usui, Yanagiatsu, Yamauchi, Kano, Yasumi, Tsuda, Fuku, Fuji, Shimeda, Shibata, Arakawa, and other detachments, which are distributed in Wusong and the city center area. The total number of personnel is more than 156,500.</p>
<h3>More Than 500 Overseas Chinese Who Took Refuge in Hong Kong Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The French ship Antripon, which departed from Marseilles a month ago and sailed to Shanghai via Hong Kong, arrived at the Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM on the 6th, carrying 200 British and French women and children who had taken refuge in Hong Kong. The ship will sail to Kobe within a few days and then return to the Songjiang River on the 15th to pick up overseas Chinese in Shanghai and sail to Marseilles via Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, Colombo, and Djibouti.</p>
<h3>We Treat Enemy Air Force Prisoners Well</h3>
<p>The Aviation Review Committee has currently accommodated a total of fifteen air force prisoners, with two prisoners living together in one room. The rooms are well-lit and ventilated, and the washrooms, bathrooms, and toilets are well-equipped, clean, and hygienic. After waking up every morning, the prisoners line up and perform morning exercises once in the sports ground. The meal expenses are twelve yuan per month. Meals are provided at 7:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 6:00 PM, and each prisoner is given a cigarette after each meal. In order to take care of the prisoners' health, in addition to providing medical treatment at any time for urgent illnesses, medical officers are sent every other day to conduct separate examinations. A special commissioner is also stationed at the facility to act as a translator. The prisoners feel that their lives are comfortable and are particularly grateful for our country's generosity and preferential treatment. Therefore, they are able to abide by the rules and obey the management, and they deeply hate the warlords in their country, expressing that they will never enlist again for the rest of their lives after returning home. The picture above shows a group photo of all fifteen prisoners: ㊀ Takeshita Ryo, ㊁ Okaki Junichi, ㊂ Iji Goro, ㊃ Sumikawa Yasumitsu, ㊄ Matsuura Hisao, ㊅ Katayama Hiroto, ㊆ Tanaka Tameyuki, ㊇ Handa Asao, ㊈ Okamoto Itsuro, ㊉ Koike Chikaotoko, ㊉㊀ Ito Tomoo, ㊉㊁ Hamasaki Saburo, ㊉➂ Kusumoto Takenori, ㊉㊃ Takahashi Heijiro ㊉㊄ Miyahara Tatsuo,</p>

<h3>Japanese Navy and Army Cannot Cooperate; Japanese Consul General in Shanghai Recalled to Japan</h3>
<p>According to a Haitong News Agency report, the rumor that rifts have occurred within the Japanese army and navy combat units on the front lines in Shanghai has been confirmed by the fact that the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai has been suddenly recalled to Japan to provide an oral report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this regard, international sources here have pointed out that the Japanese army authorities issue passes to foreign journalists, but the Japanese marines do not recognize them. At the same time, the Japanese army also does not recognize the passes issued by the marines.</p>
<h3>All Japanese Speech Is Controlled</h3>
<p>Newspapers Must Publish Propaganda News from the Military Department; No Opposition to the War or Criticism of the Aggression Policy Is Allowed</p>
<p>An editorial in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury on the evening of the 7th, entitled "The Truth About Japanese Newspapers," stated: "A certain foreign correspondent in Tokyo (whose name is withheld for certain reasons) told this newspaper's Tokyo branch that Japan is currently implementing the most stringent news control, which publishers and editors have never experienced before. The editor-in-chief of a certain Japanese newspaper told the American correspondent that his goal in publishing the newspaper was to cater to the tastes of the readers, but now it is to cater to the wishes of the military department, but he often finds it difficult to cater to the wishes of the military department. Foreign reporters are sometimes followed and monitored by nine Japanese military police officers. Fresh news is confiscated and delayed. All the news that the military department wants to publish to the public is propaganda news published by them. On July 12, the military department convened the publishers and editors-in-chief of various newspapers to instruct them on how to publish news about North China, how to write editorials, and strongly emphasized that the entire country must unanimously support the military department's policy. However, to date, no merchant has expressed support for the war in North China. All newspapers have been ordered to carry out a campaign to raise cash and comfort items. Even newspapers that oppose the military department have been forced to donate. Various newspapers are currently carrying out this campaign, attempting to make the public believe that the newspapers all support the military department. However, in fact, all of these newspapers expressed strong opposition to the military department in the previous elections. A directive issued by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department on July 14 instructed various newspapers to avoid publishing articles that oppose the war, criticize the army, sow discord between the people and the army, and that make people think that the Japanese are a war-loving nation or that Japan's foreign policy is aggressive. We can easily imagine how much legitimate news is buried by this document from the Metropolitan Police Department. We know very well that only free newspapers can provide accurate reports. Newspapers under the iron heel of the warlords can only flatter the warlords."</p>
<h3>Enemy Repeatedly Releases Poison Gas; We Telegraph the League of Nations to Stop the Atrocities</h3>
<p>When the enemy in the Luodian area attacked our Beizhouzhai Xiangong Temple southeast positions on the evening of the 4th, they actually used tear gas, causing dozens of our soldiers to be poisoned, fall into a coma, and vomit. On the morning of the 5th, the enemy again used sprayers to release sneezing gas, causing dozens of casualties among our officers and soldiers. Our military headquarters reported the situation and requested that the League of Nations be telegraphed to stop the atrocities of the enemy army.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Blood Was Not Shed in Vain</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>In recent days, the international community has risen up to provide strong assistance to us. U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a solemn speech. The League of Nations Advisory Committee passed a report on Japan's breach of contract and another document. Subsequently, the General Assembly passed a resolution on the Sino-Japanese issue. The Chairman of the London Citizens' Assembly, the Archbishop of Canterbury, issued a statement condemning Japan. The U.S. State Department issued a formal declaration, and Pittman and Stimson also made important statements. All of these just and humane proposals and indelible famous sayings were not easily obtained.</p>
<p>Our loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines are risking their lives to fight against the powerful enemy in order to protect our national territory and sovereignty and uphold world peace. Our innocent people in the rear are losing their lives in the thousands due to enemy aircraft bombings and submarine attacks. This is even more heartbreaking for civilized countries, who have risen up to condemn and strike at the violent aggressors.</p>
<p>The martyred heroes have sown the seeds of global sympathy with their brilliant blood. Those who come after them should make use of the sympathy of friendly nations, follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, and continue the bloody battle without arrogance or discouragement. We must drive the enemy out of our territory and recover our lost land. The blood was not shed in vain.</p>

<h3>Japan's Domestic Poverty and High Food Prices: A Scene of Desolation</h3>
<p>Extreme Restrictions on Freedom of Speech Lead to Widespread Silence Among the People</p>
<p>Rice Fields Unharvested, Villages Barely See a Man</p>
<p>An Eyewitness Account from Someone Returning to Shanghai from Japan</p>
<p>The English-language "The China Press" reports that a Western woman residing in Shanghai had a sudden bout of illness while in Qingdao. When the ship route between Qingdao and Shanghai was suspended, she thought it better to go to Dalian rather than stay put in Qingdao. Unexpectedly, this led to her own misfortune. Her friends returned to Shanghai safely, while she had to detour through Japan to finally reach Shanghai. The woman told her friends today that she felt very uncomfortable after arriving in Dalian because the cost of lodging and food was extremely high, and the lights were completely turned off at night, fearing that enemy planes would come to bomb them. After waiting in Dalian for several days, she was finally able to take a ship to Japan. Upon arriving in Kobe, the customs officials conducted a very strict search. All items carried by Japanese passengers were forced to be handed over, and Japanese military police even meticulously inspected each item to prevent the concealment of seditious documents, and not just once. She was subjected to such inspections three times along the way, but foreign women on the ship were fortunately spared. She stayed in Japan for three days before taking a French mail ship to Shanghai. During these three days, she had many observations and learned that Japan is currently very poor, and the people's faces are full of sorrow, especially the women, because their husbands and sons have been drafted into the army. While in Dalian and Kobe, she saw many soldiers who were only fifteen or sixteen years old, and she saw hundreds of these child soldiers boarding ships to Manchuria or North China. These young men did not shout "Banzai," but silently boarded the ships. The women who came to see them off were all in tears on the shore. She also saw hundreds of women waiting to greet ships arriving in Japan from Shanghai. All they received were small boxes containing the ashes of their loved ones. Many of these small boxes were carried off the ships. Although they did not utter complaints, they all looked miserable. She heard that many women thought that when the ships arrived, their loved ones would return in triumph as reported in the newspapers, but all they received were ashes, causing them to go insane from the shock. She drove through the countryside and saw that there was no one in the rice fields, and the crops were unharvested. It was difficult to find a single man in the villages, and food was extremely expensive. Even though she was staying in a private home, the daily meal expenses amounted to as much as five Japanese yen. The impoverished situation of the people was heartbreaking to see, all because their warlords were recklessly trying to conquer China. Although Japanese planes bombed Chinese civilians, causing tragedies, the Japanese people dared not express a word of opposition because they were closely monitored by detectives. If they uttered a word that the detectives considered to be dangerous, they would face death. Therefore, the people were all silenced. Japan is in such a difficult situation, and it is unknown what the outcome will be.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for Expanding the Promotion of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Implementation to Begin on Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>Hoping Citizens Will Unanimously Subscribe</p>
<p>Yunnan Province Remits Two Million Yuan in Bond Payments</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bonds Promotion Committee recently announced the guidelines for an expanded promotion campaign to begin on the Double Tenth Festival. The guidelines are as follows: (Explanation) The promotional method for the expanded campaign differs from the usual promotion. The usual promotion targets various groups categorized by profession and civil defense corps, while the expanded promotion divides the area into several districts or sections to achieve wider coverage. This is the most important point to understand. (Methods) ① The Fundraising Group, in conjunction with the business community, the education sector, and the various civil defense corps, will appoint special personnel responsible for contacting the various trade associations, special districts, the North and South District Citizens' Federations, schools, and neighborhood representatives to discuss cooperation methods and implementation steps to ensure that each store, each school, and each neighborhood has at least one person in charge. (For example, schools will be represented by the principal and promoted by the Education Corps; stores will be represented by the manager or accountant and promoted by the Business Corps; and neighborhoods will be promoted by the Civil Defense Corps in conjunction with the neighborhood committee. If there is no neighborhood organization, residents of the neighborhood can voluntarily apply to take on the responsibility.) As for the subscription standards, the established methods of each sector will be the principle, and making efforts to freely subscribe will be the goal of the expanded campaign. ② The Fundraising Group will print more simplified subscription forms and distribute hundreds of thousands of savings deposit books to various receiving agencies for use. ③ The Publicity Group will send personnel to contact various newspapers to publish a special supplement on the expanded promotion of National Salvation Bonds on the Double Tenth Festival, or to publish a large number of articles and cartoons on National Salvation Bonds, in order to conduct advance publicity through news. ④ The Publicity Group will collect materials in conjunction with the Receiving Group and send personnel to broadcast to broaden publicity. ⑤ The Publicity Group will design posters and slogans suitable for local application for posting in various stores and schools. ⑥ The General Affairs, Fundraising, and Publicity Groups will convene representatives from the various fundraising corps to jointly discuss promotion methods to ensure perfection. These guidelines have already been sent by the General Association to the various corps for compliance and have been telegraphed to the branches in various provinces and cities to conduct consistent implementation at the time to broaden advocacy and achieve great results.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Bond Fundraising Method</p>
<p>In order to expand the widespread fundraising for National Salvation Bonds, the General Association of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee has entrusted the Shanghai Postal Administration to have postal workers promote small-denomination National Salvation Bonds of five and ten yuan to the public. The Post Office has recently organized a committee to oversee the fundraising efforts and has drafted an outline of methods for letter carriers to promote the bonds, which will be launched to the public within days. The main points of the "Shanghai Postal Administration's Outline of Methods for Letter Carriers to Promote National Salvation Bonds" are listed below: ① In accordance with the request of the General Association of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee, each letter carrier is authorized to promote small-denomination National Salvation Bonds of five and ten yuan to the public. ② To facilitate the implementation of this method, the Bureau will collect the first batch of these small-denomination bonds from the General Association of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee, set at 100,000 yuan, to be distributed to the responsible postmasters for distribution to each letter carrier (a total of 872 people) for promotion, with each person allotted 30 yuan. ③ The matters related to the promotion of these bonds shall be managed by a committee organized by the Bureau Chief, the head of the Accounting Section, the head of the Branch Management Group, local inspectors, and the head of the Letter Carrier Management Group. ④ Each letter carrier will be issued a certificate to provide credibility when soliciting subscriptions from the public. ⑤ All bond proceeds will be submitted to the General Association of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee at the end of each month, and the total amount of bonds will be replenished once a month.</p>
<p>Subscriptions Are Exceptionally Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Association Received Bond Payments Yesterday</p>
<p>Subscriptions from Various Circles Remain Extremely Enthusiastic. ① Yunnan Province, which remitted 500,000 yuan in national currency to the General Association on September 25, telegraphed yesterday that the province had received 2 million yuan in national currency borrowed from the Fuhan New Bank. ② More than 400,000 yuan in National Salvation Bonds subscribed to by colleagues of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Ningbo Railway has been remitted to the Association in batches by the Bureau. ③ The Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Association recently sent a letter to the General Association proposing to withdraw 50,000 yuan from the 100,000 yuan deposit paid to the Customs to purchase National Salvation Bonds, which has been approved by the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department. ④ The Hometown Association Group of the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Corps held a general meeting of members at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the dining room on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building, attended by more than 80 people including Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Qian Xinzhi. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting, and Xu Jiyin first reported on the establishment of sub-teams by various hometown associations, with 40 sub-teams already established. Then, Wang Xiaolai asked the hometown association members to work hard to promote bond subscriptions and reported that the various hometown associations had already subscribed to 500,000 yuan. Finally, it was resolved that each member should raise at least 100 yuan. ⑤ The Shanghai Broadcasting Industry Association and the Shanghai Entertainment Industry Federation jointly held a special program to promote National Salvation Bonds from September 12 to 17, raising 33,444.43 yuan in national currency and 10 US dollars. Except for the receipts for savings deposit books, which have not yet been received due to procedural reasons, formal receipts have been obtained for the rest. All hard currency purchases of bonds are subject to a 6% premium. Holders of receipts from the Association can exchange them for formal receipts at the Broadcasting Association on the second floor of 323 Jiangxi Road from 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily, starting today. In addition, donations to comfort the troops and various charitable organizations totaled 3,242.23 yuan, 150,000 copper coins, and 70 Japanese sen, which have all been sent to the designated agencies.</p>

<h3>More Than 200 Enemy Troops Attempting to Cross the Tangqiao Station Bridge Are Annihilated</h3>
<p>Two Wooden Bridges Erected Are Destroyed by Our Troops. Heavy Losses to Enemy Base in Last Night's Artillery Battle. Enemy Warships Fire Cannons This Morning to Provoke, but We Ignore Them.</p>
<p>Yesterday (7th), our Guangfu front was once breached by the enemy, and the Zhangjiazhai position was also penetrated. Our troops immediately launched a counterattack with reinforcements from the Fang unit, repelling the enemy and restoring the original front line. The enemy used poison gas near Luodian, and more than 20 of our soldiers were poisoned. Today, the Guangfu front is calmer, but the enemy is attacking fiercely in the Tangqiao Station area of Yunzaobang, and they have built wooden bridges near Jiangjiazhai and Weiwan in an attempt to cross the south bank by stealth. Our troops waited for their infantry to cross the bridge, then opened fire with machine guns and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, annihilating all 200 enemy troops who had crossed over and destroying the two wooden bridges. Also, west of Tangqiao Station, our forward position was seized by the enemy, and they forcibly crossed to the south of the bank. With the support of our rear troops, the enemy was repelled. In the Zhabei area, the enemy used flame throwers to set fire to our positions and attack, but they were all repelled.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrive at Yunzaobang, Our Troops' Counterattack is Quite Successful</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for Twelve Hours in Heavy Rain. Enemy Tanks Rendered Useless.</p>
<p>The battle on both sides of the Yunzaobang was exceptionally fierce for twelve hours from yesterday to this morning. Yesterday afternoon, enemy troops on the Nanyuedun side of the south bank were surrounded by our troops. Enemy reinforcements came to their aid before 10 p.m. last night, launching a fierce attack on our positions on the Nanxuzhai side from the Yanzhai side, hoping to relieve the besieged enemy troops. Our troops had placed meticulous defenses in that area, and when the enemy approached, they bravely launched a counterattack. Also, due to the heavy rain all night last night, the enemy tanks lost their effectiveness in the mud, so our troops' counterattack was quite successful. As of this morning, the artillery fire is still very intense, and both sides are still fighting fiercely. Also, on the Zhangjiazhai side, our troops took advantage of the enemy's attack last night, feigning ignorance and luring the enemy deep into our territory. When the enemy reached a considerable area, our troops launched an all-out attack from the left and right flanks, surrounding and fiercely attacking the enemy. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we were able to restore the original position.</p>
<h3>Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Last Night's Artillery Battle</h3>
<p>From 7:00 p.m. last night, the battle in the Baoshan Road area was fierce, with gunfire and artillery fire intermittent, interspersed with the sound of hand grenades, continuing until dawn this morning. Our artillery in Pudong launched a fierce artillery attack on the areas of Hongkou, Huishan, and Yulin Road from 11:30 p.m. last night to 1:00 a.m. this morning. One shell hit the sixth floor of the Japanese police station in Hongkou at 12:40 a.m., causing heavy damage. Stray bullets fell in the Huishan area. From 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. this morning, there was occasional artillery fire in the Baoshan Road area and along the railway line. Our troops near Beijiao opened fire with machine guns, and the sound was like a string of pearls. The enemy attempted to attack, but ultimately failed. There was also artillery fire near the railway line west of the North Station. Enemy planes dropped bombs over the railway near Baoshan Road. According to investigations this morning, about ten shells fell in the Hongkou and Huishan districts last night, and many important enemy bases, such as the Wansui Pavilion Hotel on Sihang Road, were destroyed by us.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Fire Cannons This Morning to Provoke</h3>
<p>Firing Aimlessly, We Ignore Them</p>
<p>At around 11:30 p.m. last night, our Pudong artillery positions and enemy warships in Pudong engaged in an unprecedented artillery battle, with both sides firing heavy artillery. Our land-based heavy artillery, which used the most powerful firepower, made loud noises with each shot, shaking the surrounding area. The enemy soldiers on the warships were frightened, and in their panic, they wasted a large amount of ammunition, firing aimlessly. Our troops laughed at these naive artillerymen. The fierce battle stopped at 2:00 a.m. this morning, with a total of six or seven hundred shells fired. Most of the enemy shells fell in the fields, as far away as the Mitsubishi Pond and Zhoupu areas, and as close as the Tangqiao, Yangjiadu, and Zhangjialou areas, only demolishing a very small number of civilian houses, causing no damage to our military. On the contrary, our shells were accurately aimed, and shells fell and exploded in the enemy's obstructed areas in Huangpu, Osaka, Huishan, and other wharves, and in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The enemy troops, suffering such damage, still sought revenge. After 8:00 a.m. this morning, they continued to fire cannons intermittently to provoke. At the same time, three enemy heavy bombers came to Pudong to scout, flying so low that they were almost at the level of the houses, and the people in the planes could be clearly seen. Our troops, knowing the enemy's retaliatory strategy, ignored them. The enemy planes hovered for a long time, unable to find any targets, and left in disappointment. However, the enemy warships' artillery fire continued intermittently until it stopped at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<h3>Pudong After the Enemy's Random Bombardment</h3>
<p>Shells Mostly Fall in Fields, Wasting Money. Public Morale Is Calm, City Streets Are Still Lively.</p>
<p>Pudong News: After the fierce two-hour artillery battle between our forces and the enemy last night, this reporter set out this morning with Red Cross rescue workers to inspect various areas. First, we saw the most prosperous Laiyidu Main Street, with intact buildings and no damage. The shops were mostly half-open for business, and the vendors gathered on the streets to sell vegetables to the crowds of people buying groceries, who were still crowded together. These people were even more composed than during the battle. After passing through Dongchang Road and entering Pudong Avenue, there were fewer pedestrians, but the rickshaw pullers were quite active, running in twos and threes on the avenue. After passing through Shenjialong and arriving at Yangjiadu, we learned that two shells had fallen in the town, demolishing one and a half civilian houses, but there were no casualties. The lively scene on Yangjiadu Main Street was no less than that on Laiyidu. Further south to Laobaidu, six shells had fallen, but there was no damage. Turning west to east, to Zhangjialou, according to the villagers, seven or eight shells had fallen in the surrounding fields, causing no damage.</p>
<p>Leaving Zhangjialou and returning west, we went to Zhangjiabang Tangqiao to inspect. At that time, enemy warships were firing artillery in the misty rain, and the shells whistled through the air. Three enemy heavy bombers also flew in from the northeast. When they flew over our heads, we had to take appropriate evasive action. The enemy planes circled repeatedly, and we had to take cover as many as three times. Arriving at Zhangjiabang, we learned that a fragmentation shell had fallen at the bank of the Zhangjiabang pier, demolishing a civilian house and injuring three people. The reporter immediately followed the stretcher bearers to the destination and helped the three injured people onto the stretchers. We learned that they were a family of three: the father, Zhang Quansheng, 36 years old, was wounded in the waist; the eldest son, Shi Gen, 16 years old, was wounded in the head; and the younger son, A Duo, was wounded in the face. None of them were in life-threatening condition. This reporter traveled 12 li and, from what I saw and heard along the way, I felt that the enemy warships were simply firing artillery randomly, wasting a lot of money, and the effect they achieved was equal to zero.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Destroys Two Enemy Planes</h3>
<p>Confirmed News: On the evening of the 5th, our air force launched a night attack on Shanghai, dropping a total of eight bombs on the enemy's base in Yangshupu, causing fires that burned for more than an hour. The enemy suffered very heavy losses. The results that have now been clearly investigated are that there were many enemy planes parked near the Gongda Spinning Factory at that time, and two of them were indeed destroyed by our planes.</p>
<h3>One Enemy Plane Is Damaged by Our Fire</h3>
<p>At 7:00 a.m. this morning, the reporter went to inspect the northern district. At that time, an enemy plane was circling over the northwest of Zhabei, reconnoitering. At 8:25 a.m., the reporter was passing by the Shanghai Gas Company on Yuqiaqing Road, heading south from the north, when suddenly an enemy plane flew from west to east. Its altitude was only as high as the roof of a five-story building. The speed of the flight could be known from the sound of the engine, which indicated that it had reached its maximum. A wisp of yellow smoke was rising straight up from the tail, which must have been hit by our fire and was rushing back to its original base. The plane was a biplane bomber, painted silver-gray.</p>
<p>At around 8:30 a.m. today, an enemy heavy bomber in the southwest was seriously damaged by our troops' fire from an unknown location. The left wing of the plane was folded down and it was escaping toward Yangshupu through the Public Concession. It was flying very low as it passed over Shanghai, and it seemed to have no strength to fly high.</p>

<h3>The United States Is Willing to Attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister to Deliver Important Speech in Response to Roosevelt's Diplomatic Remarks</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to the newspapers, stating that the State Department has not yet received an invitation regarding the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries conference, but he intends to accept the invitation as soon as it is delivered. When asked whether the State Department's public statement yesterday condemning Japan would be sufficient to trigger the implementation of the Neutrality Act, Hull replied that this public statement was purely based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The State Department did not consult with the countries of South America before issuing the public statement because the United States was acting alone in making this decision in its capacity as a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. When asked if the rumor that the Nine-Power Treaty signatory countries conference would be held in Washington was true, Hull did not express any opinion. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Original Text of the League of Nations Resolution</h3>
<p>Siam Explains Reason for Abstention</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly passed a resolution on the Sino-Japanese conflict on the 6th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Assembly hereby adopts the two reports submitted by the Advisory Committee regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict; the Assembly expresses its support for the proposals contained in the second report; regarding the proposed convening of a conference of the member states of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Chairman is hereby requested to take the necessary actions; the Assembly expresses its moral support for China, and recommends that member states of the League of Nations should avoid taking any actions that would reduce China's ability to resist, thereby increasing China's difficulties in the current conflict, and recommends that member states of the League of Nations should consider to what extent they can individually assist China. The Assembly decides to adjourn the current session and authorizes the Chairman to reconvene the meeting at the request of the Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>First Report</p>
<p>The original text of the conclusions of the Advisory Committee's first report on the Sino-Japanese conflict is as follows: It is an undeniable fact that Japan has invaded Chinese territory with powerful military forces and placed extensive areas of China, including Peiping, under military control. The Japanese government has taken naval action to cut off Chinese ships sailing along the Chinese coastline and is conducting widespread bombing by air force in various places. After reviewing the facts obtained, the League of Nations Advisory Committee cannot but consider that the military actions taken by Japan against China by land, sea, and air forces are disproportionate to the events that caused the conflict, and that these actions cannot promote friendly cooperation between China and Japan, as Japanese politicians have declared to be the goal of their policy. The above actions cannot be justified under current legal charters or the right of self-defense, and violate Japan's obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Second Report</p>
<p>The full text is as follows: In the report that has been submitted by this Committee, the actions taken by Japan are in violation of Japan's treaty obligations and cannot be considered justified. Establishing an understanding of international law as a standard for government conduct, and maintaining respect for treaty obligations in the interactions of organized peoples, is a matter of great and common concern to all nations. The current situation in China is not only related to the two countries in conflict, but also has implications for all countries. Many countries and their peoples have been directly affected, and the world feels that peace should be restored and maintained immediately. This is the fundamental purpose for which the League of Nations exists. Therefore, the League of Nations has the responsibility and right, in accordance with its obligations under the Covenant and treaties, to seek the rapid restoration of peace in the Far East. This Committee first studied the obligations imposed on member states of the League of Nations under the Covenant in this situation. This Committee was established in accordance with Article ３ of the Covenant, which authorizes the Assembly to deal with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the world. This provision does not limit the actions of the League of Nations Assembly. China, among other provisions, has invoked Article 11, which stipulates that the League of Nations may take any measures deemed appropriate and effective to maintain peace among nations. The Sub-Committee has considered the situation with the aim of determining what action is appropriate and effective. The current conflict involves Japan's violation of treaty obligations and cannot be resolved solely by direct methods employed by the Chinese and Japanese governments. On the contrary, the entire situation must be given full consideration, and in particular, any appropriate methods should be explored to re-establish peace in accordance with the principles of the Covenant and international law, and current treaties. This Committee believes that even at this stage of the conflict, before studying other possible solutions, efforts should be made again to restore peace through agreed means. In seeking to resolve the current conflict through negotiations, the League of Nations cannot disregard the fact that one party is not a member state and has explicitly refused to cooperate with the League of Nations on political matters in the work of this Committee. This Committee is aware that the contracting parties to the Nine-Power Treaty have agreed to respect the sovereignty, independence, territorial and administrative integrity of China, and have agreed that if a situation arises involving the application of the provisions of the Treaty, and such application should be discussed, the parties concerned should consult each other with complete frankness. Therefore, this Committee believes that the first step that the Assembly should take in the name of the League of Nations is to invite the member states of the League of Nations that have signed the Nine-Power Treaty to begin such discussions at the earliest possible time. This Committee proposes that the aforementioned member states should meet immediately to decide on the best and fastest way to implement this invitation. This Committee also hopes that the countries concerned can work with other countries that have special interests in the Far East to seek ways to end the conflict through agreed means. During the period of consultations, countries may, if they deem it appropriate, submit recommendations to the Assembly through the liaison of this Committee at any time. This Committee proposes that the Assembly should not adjourn and should declare that the League of Nations is willing to fully cooperate in considering any of the above recommendations. This Committee should, in any event, reconvene within one month. Pending the outcome of the actions proposed above, this Committee requests the Assembly to express its moral support for China and recommends that member states of the League of Nations should not take any actions that would weaken China's resistance, thereby increasing its difficulties in this dispute, and should consider to what extent they can individually assist China.

<p>⊙Bangkok The Siamese officialdom has recently issued a formal announcement explaining the reasons why Siam did not vote on the Far East report and resolutions when the League of Nations Assembly was held in Geneva, saying that Siam's established policy is based on peace and the desire to maintain friendly relations with all countries. Siam gave up its voting rights in accordance with this policy. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Cabinet Structure</h3>
<p>Establishes Supreme National Defense Council</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In order to strengthen the Cabinet to cope with the current situation, the government has decided to establish an extra-cabinet organization. The outline has been drawn up by Prime Minister Konoe and is now seeking the understanding of the Cabinet members. This organization will have ten members as stipulated by the official system. The most powerful figures from the army, naval administration, financial circles, diplomatic circles and local areas will be recruited and given special appointments. This organization is not a formal organization like the former Foreign Affairs Investigation Committee or the Cabinet Deliberation Council. The government intends to use it as an organization to strengthen the Cabinet with the unity of the whole country, cooperate with the government to achieve the final goal of the incident, and implement important national policies. Therefore, it can be called the Supreme National Defense Council. The outline will be decided at the Cabinet meeting next week and will be realized at the end of the month.

<h3>American Federation of Labor President Supports Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement</h3>
<p>British People Exert Utmost Efforts to Advocate Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement, with the World Abandoning the Enemy's Brutal Acts</p>
<p>⊙Denver, USA William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, today submitted an appeal to the annual meeting of the Federation of Labor to support the British Labour Party's boycott of Japanese goods. Vice President Wool also called for a boycott of Japanese goods and asked that he be convinced that the American people do not want to indirectly assist Japan in carrying out its brutal war of aggression. (Central News Agency, 7th Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The movement to boycott Japanese goods by the British people is currently underway in many aspects. The Labour Party newspaper is now making every effort to promote it. Several co-operatives have passed resolutions opposing Japanese aggression and advocating a boycott, and many Free Churches in England and Wales have also taken similar actions. The Daily Herald today published a telegram from Madam Song Qingling in large letters, stating the struggle of China to survive as a nation and requesting the great British Labour Party to express its sympathy with concrete actions to stop Japan's arrogant acts of destroying civilization. However, the force of those who advocate prudence is also very considerable. For example, Councillor Rothwell, chairman of the Salford City Council, is one of them. Although the city expressed sympathy for China, Rothwell stated today that boycotts are a dangerous tool that can easily become an explosive. (Central News Agency, 8th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Martyr Dai Guangjin's Family Deeply Understands the Greater Good</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Dai Guangjin, a member of our Air Force's 23rd Squadron, bravely resisted the enemy this time and unfortunately died for his country. After the authorities sent a telegram to console the martyr's family, they received a reply from his father, which was awe-inspiring and deeply admirable. The reply stated briefly, "I, an old man, am deeply moved and saddened that my young son Guangjin died for the country. However, my son dedicated his life to the country and died on the battlefield this time. What is there to hate? However, I regret that the Japanese bandits still exist and have not yet achieved their goals. I hope that the generals of our air force and the soldiers at the front will work hard to kill the bandits to achieve complete success. Although I am old and weak, I will encourage my sons to rejoin the army and avenge the past. If my dead son has a spirit, I will also ask him to become a ghost to kill the bandits," etc. (Central News Agency, 7th)</p>

Please notify all shipping companies accordingly," etc. This notice is hereby issued, and the Jianghai Customs will notify all foreign transport ships to comply.</p>
<h3>Trivial Comments</h3>
<p>— Prime Minister</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago. The League of Nations Assembly passed the Sino-Japanese case. At the same time, the US government formally declared Japan an aggressor and violating treaty behavior. All kinds of expressions have won the unanimous sympathy of the world. We, the invaded country, are naturally even more grateful and excited.</p>
<p>But we have gained the unanimous sympathy of the world entirely at the price of our blood and flesh. Now we should even more use blood and flesh to repay the kindness of all countries and drive the aggressors out of the national defense line. The unpromising nature of the war in North China is admittedly undeniable. But it is not entirely the success of the enemy's mechanized infantry. It is the last page in our history of remnants of armed self-defense.</p>
<p>Although all countries in the world have expressed sympathy for our country, it is still the launch of meaning, and the progress of implementation is still to come. We should actively resist the war and launch a large-scale counter-offensive with the determination to break jade rather than be a tile. Establish the ambition of having the enemy but not me, and having me but not the enemy. It is a shame not to sacrifice. It is cowardly not to kill the enemy. We have a drop of blood to sprinkle on the enemy, and a bullet to put on the enemy's head. This is our small expression of gratitude to all countries in the world for their sympathy for us.</p>

<h3>Two Soviet Scholars Study Enemy's War-Making Power</h3>
<p>The Result of the Assessment is a Tragic Future</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reports that two Soviet scholars have studied Japan's war-making power and made the following assessments: (1) Japan's reserves of oil, rice, iron, sand, cast iron will be exhausted in the first year of the war. (2) Japan's standing agricultural products will be exhausted by the end of the second year. (3) There will be a great shortage of food in the second year. (4) A huge inflation will be implemented in the first year. (5) In the second year of the war, Japan will have to use 60% of its national income to pay for the war. During the World War, the Central European powers only used 54.7% of their national income by the fourth year, and they already felt unable to support it. Moreover, Japan's national income is far less than that of the major Central European countries. (6) Japan's trade deficit in peacetime is extremely large. During the war, its commercial competitors will take the opportunity to force it to withdraw from many current markets. Mr. Trabold, an American expert, commented on this analysis and said that Japan is specifically seeking "local" wars because it fears entering "national" wars. Japan has never experienced a major war, so it must avoid it as much as possible. Its modern army and navy are built on top of an imperialist structure and based on a feudal economy. Therefore, although they are behemoths, they can only be driven when they have the appropriate equipment. Mr. Trabold concluded by saying that if a major war is waged against Japan when its economic power is weak, especially if the major powers take joint action, the main ones being Britain, the United States, and Russia, then the outcome of this war is by no means a speculative event.</p>
<h3>Low Tide in Nantong River, Enemy Ships Stuck, in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>One Enemy Battleship Aground in the Sand</p>
<p>Nantong Dispatch: Enemy ships come to Tongyi along the river to spy from time to time. Since September 28, enemy ships have come to Tong from the Yanglinkou area in groups of three to five, and have been anchored on the Langshan River. The closest to the shore is always fifteen or sixteen miles. They fire artillery shells at the shore, intending to test our defense forces. There are also surveying ships measuring water levels in the Baimaokou area. Sometimes the ships launch small boats, leading more than ten sandboats loaded with armed soldiers, and sail to the north bank. Later, seeing that our defense forces were prepared, they retreated immediately. This situation has been common for several days. Now our river defense is consolidated. Although the enemy ships fire artillery shells to provoke, we still maintain our composure. The enemy shells also fall in the fields, but only a few villagers are killed or injured, and all buildings are undamaged. Now the tide is low and the reefs and sand are more dangerous. The enemy ships that have broken in are in a dilemma. One of the larger ones was trapped in a shallow beach at noon on the 27th and could not move. Barges are being used to rescue it, and the work is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>In the area along the river, enemy planes form teams for several days, all flying from east to west and then turning back. After passing Langshan, they use machine guns to strafe the farmers in the countryside from time to time, killing and injuring many. Enemy reconnaissance planes also fly in from time to time, spying on the coast and the heights of the city and towns. After the air raid alarm is issued, the air defense department immediately deploys defenses in separate routes, declares martial law, and directs the people to abide by the regulations and avoid harm, so there is not much damage.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Various Schools Move to Open</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the primary and secondary schools in the county town have been ordered to temporarily take care of the schools. In order to avoid wasting students' studies due to the extension of the war period, it has been decided to move the schools to the countryside to open. It is heard that the provincial girls' high school will move to Hengshan, and the county high school will move to Zhangliantang Town in Qingpu County and Tinglin Town in Boxian County, respectively. The Zhangzhen branch school is scheduled to start registration on the 6th and start classes on the same day.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Fangtai Town</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd, seven enemy planes bombed Fangtai Town, dropping more than 20 bombs, destroying 60 to 70 civilian houses and killing more than 10 people. At dawn on the 4th, a fisherman's boat south of Wangxian Bridge lit a fire to catch fish. Enemy planes dropped two bombs into the paddy fields. Four or five bombs were dropped north of Tianfu Temple on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, and the tracks were slightly damaged and were repaired immediately.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Chongshi Girls Make Winter Clothes</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Student Anti-Japanese Support Association of Chongshi Girls' Middle School, executive director Min Xiuqin, and members Jiang Zhihong, Yang Yiguang, and Fa Ruixian, etc., more than ten people, advocated a one-day fundraising campaign, and as a result, raised more than 100 yuan in legal tender. Now, because the autumn wind is gradually cooling, they are using this money to rush to make winter clothes to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers. In recent days, they have purchased a large amount of materials and started cutting and sewing, working day and night, and are extremely busy. Every stitch and thread are sewn by the students themselves, which is especially commendable.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Issues Order to All Counties to be Responsible for Sheltering Refugees from War Zones</h3>
<p>Relief Society Telegrahs Chairman of Jiangsu Requesting Order to Raise Food and Supplies for Refugees in Wuxi</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang counties have been directly affected. Refugees have fled alone, and the roads are full of displaced people. The situation is extremely miserable. A part of the refugees are running the concession for rescuers and sending them to various shelters to find ways to shelter them. The remaining refugees have fled to Kun, Qing, Wu, Xi and other counties, and the number is extremely large. They are exposed to the wind and eat in the open, suffering from hunger and cold, and the misery cannot be described. The Tai-Jia-Ning Refugee Relief Association specifically telegraphed the Central and Jiangsu Provincial Governments, requesting that all counties be ordered to be responsible for sheltering them. Yesterday, the reply from the Provincial Government stated (above omitted): "I have received your telegram and have ordered all counties to be responsible for finding ways to shelter them. You should be informed accordingly." In this batch, another telegram from the Provincial Government Yu stated (above omitted): "I have received your telegram and am deeply saddened by the plight of the refugees in the three counties who have fled and are displaced. I have instructed that branch offices be set up separately as entrusted, and the provincial relief sub-committee is rushing to set them up. I will reply for verification," Chen Guofu Yu.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Refugee Relief Association sent more than 2,000 refugees to Wuxi a few days ago, where the Wuxi Charity Federation set up shelters to house them. However, the branch in fact has difficulty taking care of the food and supplies for the refugees. Yesterday, it specifically telegraphed Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, instructing the county government to be responsible for raising funds.</p>
<h3>Tax Collection Methods After the Implementation of Transit Duty</h3>
<p>Still Uphold the Spirit of One Item, One Tax Method to Make Up for Tax Revenue Changes</p>
<p>Since the new transit tax was implemented on October 1, businesses have lacked a clear understanding of the situation. Many have written to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for explanation. It has been heard that the Chamber of Commerce, in order to assist in enriching the national finances during the war, has published the details of the tax in a special wartime publication of the Commercial Monthly this month. The Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the Knitting Industry Association yesterday to explain the tax. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>I have received your letter. In the past, all goods transported by civilian ships or trains, and whose starting and ending points were not from port A to port B, were exempt from transit tax. Now, due to the shortage of import and export taxes, the Ministry of Finance has changed the method in order to make up for the revenue. Regardless of the above regulations, all goods that pass through a Customs place in the middle are subject to tax, regardless of the means of transportation and whether the starting and ending points are ports. In other words, the transit tax is essentially a type of domestic transit tax in theory. Once it has been revised, it more fully expresses the nature of a transit tax. However, one point must be specifically explained: Since the abolition of Likin, the spirit of one item, one tax for commodity tax has been maintained. Therefore, the Ministry Order states that those who have completed transit tax or consolidated tax at other port customs offices will be exempted from collection. Therefore, the various sections in your letter are still maintained by the principles and systems in this Ministry Order and have not been changed.</p>

<h3>Customs Authorities Continue to Send Personnel to Exercise Authority in the Eastern District of Shanghai as Usual</h3>
<p>Resolutely Do Not Recognize Illegal Facilities of the Enemy</p>
<p>After the enemy authorities seized the Yangshupu Lan Road Jianghai Customs Branch and illegally collected taxes, it has aroused close attention from people of various countries. The Jianghai Customs has not yet protested to the enemy because the enemy has not formally announced this matter. However, because it infringes on our country's Customs sovereignty, it is determined not to recognize such illegal facilities. It is still exercising its authority in the Yangshupu Hongkou area in accordance with the law. Although the Chinese staff there can no longer go, Western staff are still sent to the war zone to fulfill their responsibilities. Now there are many foreign merchants who go there to pick up goods, etc., so the Western customs officials still go to work as usual.</p>

<p>Wartime Youth, 7th Term</p>
<h3>The Activities of Italian Youth</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Zhiqian, the principal of Shanghai Women's High School, recently returned to China from Italy. I had an evening conversation with her. I have recorded a few excerpts regarding the activities of Italian youth as follows. The following are all Dr. Wu's words. — Attached note by Wancheng —</p>
<p>"The Italian nation, once also dispirited, has seen its national spirit become increasingly invigorated since Mussolini implemented national training. Every Saturday afternoon is Fascist Day (Sabato Fascirta). All schools, from elementary to university, are closed, and military training is conducted. Elementary school students practice with wooden guns, lively and robust. Middle school students practice with real guns, full of heroic spirit, just like soldiers. University students practice combat, as if they were obsessed and frantic, extremely brave, as if facing a major enemy, which sometimes leads to injuries.</p>
<p>"Italian youth, both male and female, are physically and mentally very healthy. Very few wear glasses due to nearsightedness.</p>
<p>"The Italian nation extremely worships heroes and has extreme faith in Mussolini. And Mussolini pays close attention to training young people. He often says, 'The life of Fascism lies in training capable youth.' As for their view of China, because they extremely worship heroes, they initially looked down upon it, believing that Chinese people, especially Chinese youth, were all useless. Since China's full-scale resistance against Japan, striking back at those who strike us, especially the Battle of Shanghai, where our troops fought heroically, the Italians were quite shocked. Italian youth and public opinion changed from contempt and ridicule to respect and sympathy. The strong survive, and might makes right—this has been proven here!"</p>
<h3>One Heart</h3>
<p>— Mengmei</p>
<p>Now, we only have one heart: that is "resistance"!</p>
<p>"Resistance" requires unity. No division, no fracture, the whole country with one heart!</p>
<p>How can "resistance" be sustained? Fearless, selfless, soldiers and civilians with one heart!</p>
<p>The primary condition for "resistance": no romanticism, no timidity, youth with one heart!</p>
<p>We only have one heart for "resistance"; everyone must go to "resist" with one heart!</p>
<h3>Suicide Policy</h3>
<p>— Liu Yucai</p>
<p>Who doesn't love their country as much as I do? The people of XX country know to resist externally and fight for markets. But how could the people of X country, X country, X country, XXX country, XXX country, etc., not know to resist externally and fight for markets for their own benefit? If you resist them, they will resist you. Resisting back and forth, the strength of each country has nowhere to expand. As a result, XX country, hesitating with no way out, turned to expanding into our Chinese territory. Having found this behemoth, it is like a cat catching a mouse. It can only listen to the cat's devouring and fighting, but it does not have the mouse's freedom to move. It only allows XX country's aggression and oppression but does not allow the Chinese people's patriotic self-defense. This kind of blind patriotic behavior, with oneself but without others, will not only fail to save the country but will instead be a suicidal policy that harms the country and the people. This suicidal policy that harms the country and the people is currently being pursued by XX country, which is using its entire military and financial power to continuously invade our Chinese territory. For the sake of self-defense and national salvation, China has no choice but to give the aggressor a severe counterattack. The aggressor truly did not expect this resistance: In just over a month, XX country has suffered significant damage in terms of military and financial strength, as well as domestic economic panic, popular complaints, and severe attacks from international public opinion. These are indeed creating some difficulties for the aggressor. This is precisely XX country's suicidal policy that harms the country and the people.</p>
