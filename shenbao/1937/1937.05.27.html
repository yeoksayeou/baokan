<p>各報作煽動宣傳　連日載挑釁消息　認中政府對華北開始作變動之工作　青島稅警換防亦竟成為彼方之口實</p>
<p>［東京］此間對華之空氣、突然緊張、因各報發行號外、更爲增加、據各報號外稱、有日漁船兩艘、在北海被中國稅警槍擊之、此種挑釁之消息、適在外務省與陸軍省特派員在華考察與軍事官員在津會議時傳播、頗值注意者也、（廿六日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>解決遠東問題之應取方式星</h3>
<p>數週以來。遠東問題因英帝國會議之舉行。英日談判之具體化。與吾國孔祥熙特使之往來於倫敦日內瓦。頗有急轉直下之傾向。而澳洲自治邦總理萊恩斯在帝國會議中所提太平洋區域安全恊定之主張。更為國際視聽之所集中。目前的情勢。雖然還沒有到召集太平洋會議。求遠東問題總解决之機會。但是自九一八至今。現在是比較合於希望的時間。當然。如果日本迷途而不知返。如果美國繼續採袖手旁觀的態度。如果英國存苟且偷安之心。如果中國內部還不能團結。這種解决的可能。是極其渺茫的。我們假定時機已漸漸成熟。我們對於遠問題總解決應取之方式。要有一個共同的見解與信念。</p>
<p>這個方式應該包括三點第一對於中國問題之解决獨佔的方式與瓜分的方式。旣絕對無益。機會均等與門戶開放。在中國主權獨立領士完整原則與事實下。是可以允許的。第二。認定强固繁榮之中國。為遠東和平之最好保障。一切問題要以中國利益為前提。凡有害於中國之一切現狀。均須設法打破。第三。當求永久的實際的解决。而不是表面的苟且的解决。集體和平要有國際力量支持着不能够完全依賴各國的簽字一個沒有實力為背景的條约。無論怎樣完美。結果總是顯武軍人手上的廢紙。</p>
<p>關於第一點。過去談遠東問題的人。有的主張獨佔中國。如日本所提出的東亞門羅主義。尤其是包括在一九三四年天羽聲明中的各項主張。有的主張瓜分中國。如華盛頓會議以前的所謂承認某國在某區的特殊利益。同最近日本報紙所鼓吹的“日本華北與英國華中華南”勢力範圍之劃分英國政府已正式否認。如最近艾登外相對扎祥熙所聲明的。英日談判决不致損反中國之利益獨佔瓜分以外。則為列强共同開發中國。這個方式。在中國有强固中央政府有自主能力的條件下。未始不可接收。孫總理旣有利用外資開發中國之計畫。而現政府亦曾再三聲明歡迎與世界各國合作。孔特使在倫敦的工作大約偏重於財政經濟方面取得各國共同的合作在政治方面。我們應該歡迎沿太平洋各國。共同談判建設起太平洋集體安全系統。而中國當然願意負着最大的維持遠東秩序的責任與義務。</p>
<p>第二。中國是遠東問題的核心中國的强盛又是遠東和平的最大保障。所以任何問題總以中國民族自由平等復興自强為標凖進行考慮。我們不能以保持現狀為解决方式更不能承認任何旣成事實。在一九二二年華盛頓條約簽訂的時候各國已經省悟到這一點。所以不許任何國家利用當時中國弱點而妨害中國建國工作之進行。現在中國已經有了統一的强固的政府政治秩序與社會秩序業已安定遠東長久和平。已經因中國之統一而露出一綫曙光這種曙光的强化有賴於中華民族解除了當前之桎梏。就中國論固然應認定天助自助之旨自奮圖强就遠東有關的列强論。也應該認識這個偉大的民族是不能够水久屈居於不平等被侵略地位的失地的收回。不平等條約之廢約是中國的合理要求是和平的先决條件。</p>
<p>最後一切解决要有實際的力量做維持力而不能完全依賴任何國之信用與善意華盛頓九國公約之化為廢紙便因為沒有制裁之力量雖然四國公約中有互相措商之規定然而沒有一個實在之組織。應付隨時發生之問題。所以求遠東問題之澈底解决不但要有集體安全制度而且要有組織的有實力的集體安全制度沒有制裁侵略的步驟與力量安全是沙中之塔。中國所要求的不只是安全。而更要有保障的安全中國不只要和平。更要和平建築在正義上面。</p>
<h3>巴黎東京飛行敗法飛機墜落高知縣</h3>
<p>兩飛行家受傷機身破毀　自上海續飛後一路逆境</p>
<p>⊙高知　高知縣吾川郡諸木村戶原海岸頃發見墜落飛機一架、似為杜來機、現在調查中、</p>
<p>又八時二十五分電、杜來機於下午七時三十分降落於高知縣、吾川郡諸木村仁原海岸、搭乘者二人負輕傷、已收容於該村大石病院、現施行手術中、又十時二十五分電、傾倒於高知南方二里之戶原海岸之杜來機、機身業已大破、右翼殆已與機髒分離、左翼尚存、在海浪激打之中、村民徹夜警戒中又十時四十五分電、杜來氏面上縛上繃帶、米希來底茂前額亦受輕傷、但究為空中勇士、雖負重傷、仍飲酒吸烟、而侃侃談曰、余等自於本日下午一時三十分飛離上海以來、完全陷入難航中、由回國之西方飛往東方、後更折回西方、此次復欲向東時、因見砂灘、遂行降地、今雖排萬難而抵此、然目的未達、誠屬遺憾、言時不禁聲淚俱下、</p>
<p>又下午十一時四十分電、杜米兩氏已於下午十時由汽車送抵高知市之赤十字病院、卽受正式之治療、兩氏雖仍精神佳旺、然杜來所負之傷、須經過十日、方可全愈、米氏亦經一星期之療養云、（二十六日同盟電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］法國飛行家杜萊特及米希萊蒂、自巴黎飛往東京、企圖以一百小時完畢全程、創造新紀錄、而領取政府四十萬法郎之獎金、不幸在台灣海峽附近、因氣候惡劣、被迫折回廣州灣、定二十六晨繼續起飛、彼等必須在二十六晨九時零五分前、到達東京、乃在限度以內、但此已屬不可能、故杜米兩氏此次之計劃已宣告失敗云、（二十五日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［東京］法國大使館接得杜來機抵上海之報後、以為“航空法國”之志願此次已可遠到、情勢甚為緊張、安利大使以次全體館員、均往羽田飛機塲等候、帝國飛行恊會亦着手各種歡迎準備、但查杜來機自由巴黎出發以來、至二十六日正午止、已有九十三小時五十四分、故非於二十六日午後六時零六分（東京時間）飛到羽田、仍不能達百時之紀錄、現所賸餘之上海東京間路程、為一七七〇公里、照“克特倫西蒙”機之性能、至速需時七小時半、故能否獲得錦標、殊足憂慮云、（二十六日同盟電）</p>
<h3>昨晨過滬情形</h3>
<p>（本埠消息）法飛行家杜來特與米希萊蒂、昨晨十時零五分抵滬、休息一小時、繼續起飛、詎以輪胎損毀、又被延遲、至午十二時三十五分始成行、如沿途無故障、則於五時半前可到達目的地、杜米兩氏原可於昨日過滬、乃以機件障碍、被阻於廣州灣附近之福爾鮑耶、躭延約十餘小時、始將機件修復、而沿海氣候亦已轉佳、卽於昨晨二時起飛、沿途無阻、至十時零五分抵滬、在中法官民五十餘人之熱烈歡迎中、安然降落龍華飛行港、兩氏所駕之飛機係“哥德隆”西蒙式單翼機、全身銀白、髹以紅字、兩翼及尾翼亦漆以紅色條紋、機首甚長、駕駛室在前、僅容兩人、其後儲藏庫、兩飛行家均衣青色飛行服、精神煥發、下機後、與到塲歡迎之法總領巴達斯、法公董局總督魏志誠、警務總監法勃爾等、一一握手、並略進飲料及點心後、卽檢視機件、並加裝燃料及機油等、以備績飛、昨晨本市雖仍有陰雲、且乍晴乍雨、但據東京來電、則謂沿海氣候已轉佳、預計路程自滬直飛東京、約需五小時、故卽於十一時十五分開動馬達、繼續飛行、詎繞塲半匝、因輪胎洩氣、致一輸陷入十中、在塲之東端停留、卽由在塲法僑及中國與歐亞兩公司機匠等恊助修理、一時塲中汽車往來頗為緊張、蓋如在一小時內未能修復、恐又將功敗垂成、旋經換去舊胎、延誤約一小時許、始於十三時三十五分飛出、須下午六時前飛達東京、方能造成此艱難險鉅之新紀錄、惟昨晚法領署方面得訊、直至晚間八時半左右、始飛抵鹿兒島、是則二氏終未能如願以償、然此全因天公不做美、屢受挫折、其精神亦殊足為世人稱譽也、</p>

<p>［東京］日本政府雖甚願與英美德諸國競爭對華借欵、然已遭逢動員國內剩餘資金之嚴重問題、因剩餘資金已為軍事工業之膨脹所耗盡也、外務省為謀解决此問題起見、今日邀請與在中國投資有關之興業•朝鮮•台灣•住友•與第一等銀行代表、舉行會議、試探彼等關於對華借欵意見、雖某某方面對此表示樂觀、但財政界透露消息、謂今日之討論、依然集中於處理對華各種舊債問題、希望中國政府將各該舊債如新承認之債欵、予以償還、惟某種信用借欵問題、亦曾提出討論云、（中央社二十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>浙省財政的前瞻（續）</h3>
<p>說到漁業、本省海岸綫有九百九十六公里、漁業每年的出產、以前曾達到五千萬的紀錄近來一落千丈還不能到二千萬、這個原因當然很多、我們要使漁業復興、第一要把他的現狀加以改善、减少漁民的擔負、减少生産的成本、這是最主要的、一面實行漁監公賣、使漁民眞正可以得到便利、一面要使漁民的組織漸漸健全起來、舉辦漁民放欵、這種初步工作完成之後我想浙江的漁業多少可以在市塲上勉强和外來産品競爭了、然後我們再把他現代化、冷藏之設備用新式漁輪捕魚等等、都可以陸續辦起來、兄弟到浙江口後、就請中央研究院動植物研究所派調查隊到沿海、帶去調查水産、現在正在積極工作中、同時我們也在討劃辦一個海洋生物研究所、從這方面做起、我想本省的漁業、一定有很大希望的、</p>
<p>其餘的工業建設鑛業、也是很重要的現在已由中央研究院地質研究所和本省建設廳合組一個鑛產調查隊、而且邀請實業部和中央大學浙江大學三方面的專家來參加、把本省地質鑛産做一個有系統的調查、第一期的工作、預定一年、現在注意到諸暨的鉛鋅鑛、青田的鉏鑛、江山衢縣長興的煤鑛、嵊縣吳興等十七縣的砩右鑛、昌化的銻鑛鉏鑛、先就這幾處試探鉏鑛現在已有首次的報告、希望內容比福建還來得多、現在正做進一步的試探工作、預期不久、就可以開採了、其餘各鑛等到初步試探工作相當完成之後、也要陸續去進行、至於平陽的礬鑛是世界有名的出產、現在大規模的工藝應用方法、正在中央研究院化學研究所長期研究中、截止到現在他們研究的結果、已經得到好幾種方法了、就是把他主要部份拿來裂鋁副産品拿來做肥料、這個研究已經相當的完成、不過還只是試騐室的成功罷了、我們現在還想在長興煤鑛附近辦一個水泥廠和一個玻璃廠、已經在計劃中我們知道上海水泥廠所用的灰石、是由長興供給的、現在煤和石旣然同在處、還有石英鑛在附近、那末我們辦廠地位當然更相宜的、</p>
<p>糖業的提倡、也已經開始進行了、現在我們在平陽租了五百畝的蕩田、到瓜哇廈門等地方去辦幾種改良種糖蔗、先來做一個試騐等到明春、就可知道初步的結蠟如何、要是好的那末我們就可以積極繁殖糖蔗、一面就進行設立新式煉糖廠、其餘如造紙業的改進釀酒業的改良、茶業的改善和擴充、也都在我們計劃進行當中、說到一般農業的種子改良和推廣、先要有大量種子的預備才好、因爲我們過去稻種的改良、今年還只得到二十萬畝的繁殖麥種只有五萬畝、為數太少了、所以今年就凖備大量的種子、預備明年作較大的推廣在植物方面病蟲害是很重要的問題、本省對昆蟲方面、過去已有相當的注意、所以今年把昆蟲局重行恢復了、</p>
<p>本省風景名勝、一向是全國有名的遊覽區域、適宜於休養的地力和遊覽的處所、還待開闢的多得很因此、本省發展導遊事業的重要、至少也不亞於絲綢和海産、只要我們適當的運用就是了、</p>
<p>總之、生產建設是十頭萬緒、今天兄弟不過就現在已經打算中的事業約略說一說、還談不到什麽計劃、因爲我們要本省經濟眞正的改善先要有種種建設事業做基礎同時要有種種建設事業的推進、先要有財政的基礎現在當財政沒有上軌道之前、生産建設、實在無從談起的、下一年度一切經濟的建設、只可以算做一個凖備的工作至少一二年後才可以將有程序的長期的經濟建設計劃提出來</p>
<p>此後本省的財政、如兄弟上面所說的一方面積極去合理緊縮他方面盡量去開源、不僅在消極方面、如財務行政的整理稅收的整頓等還要在積極方面去做、就是努力作生産的建設、去培養稅源、目前本省財政和各省比較、我們是負債最重的一省、似乎已到山窮水盡的地步了、不過我們有了二千一白萬的人民、和十萬一千三百多方里的面積、而且有文化的基礎、要是我們省內省外的本省人士能夠致動員起來、共同為桑梓努力用合作的方法、拿科學做基礎、切切實實的現代化的做起來、希望是一定很多的（完）</p>

<h3>紗布暢銷後存紗大减價格飛漲</h3>
<p>各廠趕紡暫停拋售期貨　工人技能均已竭力改進</p>
<p>自全國農產豐收、農村漸趨復興後、紗布因購買力增强、頗能暢銷、中外紗廠雖日夜開工趕紡、總因求過於供、紗價飛漲存紗大增、總約三萬包、各紗廠停止抛售期貨、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>存紗大減價格飛漲</p>
<p>紗布暢銷之後、停工之廠、先後以出租改組復業及代營等方式開工、以上海而言、華商三十一家、英商四家、日商三十家、均已日夜開工趕紡、總因紗布暢銷以致各廠所紡之紗、不敷供給購買者、市場上已趨於求過於供之現象、紗價飛漲、華商紗布交易所標準紗價、五月期每包漲至國幣二百八十一元、存紗大减、以上海而言、總共不及三萬包、</p>
<p>各廠暫停拋售期貨</p>
<p>上海存紗、最、竟達十五萬包、目前所存已不及三萬包、此三萬包之紗、大都存於華商紗布交易所堆棧內、至於中外各紗廠因各地織造廠及用戶需要正殷、紡成之花、不敷分配、所以對於拋售期貨、不得已暫行停止、各廠堆棧已無存紗、至於棉花銷路、雖隨紗而暢、奈因去年全國棉産豐收、所以價格之漲不及棉紗、交易所價格、五月期每担爲國幣四十八元、</p>
<p>紗廠改進工人技能</p>
<p>中外紗廠對於工人之投能、已逐漸設法改進、此於成本减輕關係至鉅、以華廠平均每一工人管理紡錠能力、以二十二年為一百作指數、二十三年為一三二•八一、二十四年為一四六•八七、二十五年為一五五七一、今外商在華紗廠、對工人技能雖竭力改進．惟工人工資、亦逐漸提高、如自勸增加工人工資改善工人待遇等、華商紗廠最近亦自動增加工人工資、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>跳舞在上海</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>跳舞在上海，最近可算得是全盛時期了，全市大小舞塲不下二十餘家，跳舞學校還不止此數，這種畸形發展，自然引起“衛道之士”的不安：消極的，摇頭歎息“世風之日下”；積極的，曾聯名要求取締跳舞塲，後來改爲折中辦法—舞塲營業時間不得超過午夜十二時，及教育界方面的禁止中學生跳舞等。當時，各方的輿論也並不一致，現在則依舊有“通宵營業”的舞塲，和穿着最時式洋服的學生和舞女談戀愛。</p>
<p>果然，説跳舞是一種藝術，那是掩飾得太漂亮了：説它是運動吧，似乎還是離題太遠。跳舞塲在上海所以發達的原因，就因爲它是一種娱樂而已。比看電影，逛窰子，進一歩的奇特的（Grotesque），色情的（Erotic）娱樂。而娱樂之於小市民，正如水之於魚，原是很要緊的。</p>
<p>雖然在“國難嚴重”的時候，跳舞也曾被扯起作爲“救國”的旗幟，那是因爲參與跳舞的人事關係，未便作永久的例子。</p>
<p>而且，小市民層之於跳舞，不僅要“跳”，也喜歡“看”。所謂“看”，自然不會是到舞塲里去“擺拆字攤”，看着人家在舞池里和舞女調情，因爲他自己也曾做過那樣主角，日久玩生，“奇特的”已是“平常的”了。於是要“看”，看掛着奶罩，穿着三角褲的肉體在台上像蛇一樣的游泳，還有：一種專以擺動臀部的，呌做草裙舞最受人歡迎。普通以白俄女子在下等電影院里表演者最多，至於直接從外洋運來的“萬花團”，“新九點鐘歌舞團”等自然更受人歡迎。因爲西洋女子體格健全，又能儘量發揮觀衆所希冀的刺激。這些歌舞團常常能够一本萬利，滿載而歸的。</p>
<p>但是，不知什麽時候起，紅面孔與黑面孔打架的平劇也以“肉感跳舞”爲號召了。平劇近幾年在上海，真是一落千丈，除了平津的名角兒還能號召顧曲周郎，專唱連台戲的舞台就祇能在佈景，機關的新奇，神秘上面努力了，終於發展到蟒袍與玉腿齊飛，花臉共朱唇一色。自己對於平劇少緣，不過據看過的朋友告訴我，那些跳舞的姑娘既没有受過訓練，而且身材瘦弱，看她們聲嘶力竭的在台上揮臂彈腿，心里就有些不忍，同情之不暇，那里還説得上“刺激”！這位朋友自然不能代表全體觀衆的意見，本來看戲就是看戲，又不是到災區去施賑，這種精神分析是多餘的。不過最近工部局因平劇中串跳舞，認爲有碍風化而將加以禁止了。既稱“有碍風化”，朋友的話似乎更不可靠了，因爲照他的“看”法，應該是“救濟”，而不是“禁止”。不過，這些事情都用不到我們來顧問，説是“於心不忍”而要“救濟”，那自有慈善家在；説是“有碍風化”加以“禁止”，工部局當然自有辦法。</p>
<p>我的意見，畸形發展是暫時的，而小市民層的需要“刺激”也不會就這樣“滿足”的，舉行“浴衣伴舞”的舞塲也未能號召舞客，而另外一些人的“看”法又是“於心不忍”；更進一歩自然是更爲“奇特”，更爲“色情”，終至像我朋友那類人“慘不忍睹”而後已。</p>
<h3>爲擱樓同胞請命</h3>
<p>— 倪潤之</p>
<p>從公共租界工部局提出了拆除界內擱樓問題以來，對這問題最感不安的人，到並不是在住擱樓的人，而是一般被榨取而又去榨取别人的人，即俗呼二房東，三房東，以及一般開店的老闆人等，事實因爲實際住擱樓的人，他們在這資本主義的社會裏，早已成了人渣之中的枯渣了，所以即使工部局真的把他們這點非人生活的擱樓小權利也都取消了，一部份依附在開店老闆之下的擱樓同胞，（包括有藝徒，店員，雜役人等）他們身上都有着利之可以被人吸取，當然，自然地會有人替他們另行安排的，另一部份受壓榨於二三房東之下的擱樓同胞，（包括有苦力，拉車，推車，小偷，拆字先生，皮匠，小販，賣唱者，打拳師，賣膏藥，小流氓，扒手，舞台及遊藝塲裏的跑龍套，雜要戲子，跟包，茶房，以及少數的勞働者，妓院裏的拉胡琴，雜差人等的人）他們雖無依附，然他們到很隨便，一因爲他們之中大部份人的職業，都是屬於自由之中的自由者，二對於擱樓之與墻角，或竟露天，在他們的直覺上，除晚幾小時稍可人意的睡眠之外，誰也都很明瞭後者勝過於前者的事實，因之無論弄堂口，過街樓下，墻角落裏，或者備有三層樓舖床的小客棧裏，他們一概都能隨便使得，絶對在他們受用上是無甚區别的。內中也許有一部份人會自然地呌出説：“到閘北去，到南市去”。</p>
<p>事實當然是極平凡而且也早爲一般人所明白而又明白的了，但是我很奇怪，同時也很發悶，不知道住洋樓的人和住擱樓的人，是不是同樣是人類之中的人？他們住在界內，是否同樣都是納税的？工部局何所依而竟欲歧視這批住擱樓的人？要説是不衛生不安全，那末工部局既收了他們所繳納的税捐，便應當極盡責的爲他們設法安全，設法衛生，終不能既受了他們的錢財，而不給他消災啊！反正事實擺在眼前的，他們住擱樓的人，并不是不懂衛生，奈何他們没有能力去衛生，他們也很知道睡在擱樓上較諸睡在街道生的要安全的多了！所以我説聰明的工部局當局；你們也當把你們的責任，細細地檢討一下，雖然你們有着“唯武主義”作你們統治小市民的唯一的法寳，但是——枯煤爐裏的煤，燃不起火來的時候，狂風吹起來的枯灰，也許會朦住人們眼睛的呢——何况，擱樓的總數有着八萬餘隻，人數是超過了十萬上呢！</p>
<p>退一歩設想，假定真的把這八萬餘隻擱樓拆除了，試問工部局當局，你們是否能確保這十萬餘由擱樓裏掃除出的枯渣人，不因無處可宿而流散於街頭巷口而發生更不安全，不衛生等的問題嗎？二三房東失去了這十萬餘可被榨取的枯渣人之後，是否再能馴服地或再有能力爲工部局負担一切的費用（指税捐的繳納）呢？會不會引起界內空屋的再增多呢？一切的一切，都是很成問題的事呢！聰明的工部局當局，我看還是從長計議出一個妥善的辦法爲上呢！</p>
<h3>葬禮</h3>
<p>— 湜思</p>
<p>——行旅散記乏二</p>
<p>沿着波爾加Bolcar河流一直南行，一天比一天地溫熱起來了。南方的五月，格外噪暖，火辣辣的陽光焦炙着我們這一羣行旅者，原先棕色的皮膚，更加速的黧黑了。有時候，堅結的肩肉王為了行李包的摩擦，也居然感到扎扎地痛楚。陽光的炎熱昏瞆着我們的腦筋，是那樣地使入難受呵。</p>
<p>可是，我們是自願的行旅者，白種，黃種的青年。我們要到極邊的南方凡勒拉Valera去呵，那裏是南方的聖地，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>花一樣美麗，夢一樣幽麗的城！同一的對那幽麗的城的瞻仰的期望，與行旅生活的愛好，使我們没有疆界國籍限制的集體起來了，我們像兄弟一般的親愛呵！</p>
<p>波爾加河緩緩地流着，在五月底陽光裏閃耀着點點的銀波，水是那樣地淸碧，張着白帆的小艇輕巧地在水面上飄着，兩岸全是青綠地茂盛的芭蕉樹，河流是無盡地伸展開去，兩岸的青綠也無盡地伸展開去。我們踏着健壯的歩伐在黄沙泥路上走着。汗珠濕了我們的背，濕了我們的全身，天氣熱呵，河裏的青水誘炫了我們每個人的人。</p>
<p>“息息吧，……”有誰在這樣説着了。</p>
<p>“不遠了，前面有椰子林呢，到那裏再息吧！”</p>
<p>緊跟在我後面的漢尼爾Ilauiel説。他是一個健壯的西班牙人。他有曲卷得可愛的頭髮，靈活的大眼珠，與筆直一統的高鼻子，大家都歡喜他。他是温順而堅强，一個社會主義者，爲了××××從祖國逃亡出來的，這一次，他要從凡勒拉設法轉道偷偷地回到祖國去。我與他有很好的感情。</p>
<p>那是一個有星月的夜裏，還是在庫達爾加Kotalcar的時候，我與他在草原上乘凉，他向我説：</p>
<p>“從凡勒拉，我要轉道回到西班牙去。”</p>
<p>“呵，爲什麽？”我驚異的問。</p>
<p>這一夜他告訴了我他的一切，他説他要回去繼續鬬爭，在那裏，有許多親切的同志等着他，而且那些叛亂的萬惡的法西斯呵，他要回去。</p>
<p>“椰子林到了，息息吧”。漢尼爾是那樣地高興。</p>
<p>我們停了下來。在椰子樹下攤開了行旅者簡略的行裝。温凉的風吹撲着我們，感到一陣一陣的淸凉，我們全是那樣的愉快呵。有人把椰子一個一個地打下來了，大家一窩蜂的搶拾了分食着。</p>
<p>波爾加河在陽光裏閃着銀波，它是那樣地淸澈呵，於是，一個又一個地，我們全跳到波爾加河裏去了。水是温凉地，適意呵，一絲不掛的身子在水裏，像睡眠在Giemons上一樣。</p>
<p>南方五月火辣辣的陽光，再不能使我們感到炎熱了。我們儘意地在水裏浮游着，浮游到河流的遠方去。</p>
<p>“來呵……”是那樣高朗短促而喘急的呼聲。再聽不見第二聲了。</p>
<p>一個大水花在遠遠的河上浮沉着，浮沉着，……不再浮起來了。誰能快速地到達那裏呢！</p>
<p>兩個鐘頭之後，漢尼爾安静地躺在椰子林裏了，他原先壯實的身躺似乎胖了一點，可是是種。他是那樣安静地躺着呵，可是他永久不會醒來了。</p>
<p>黑夜來了。風括着椰子葉“咯，咯……”地作響。漢尼爾的四周，燃明了盞盞煤氣燈，林子照得像白畫一樣地光亮。可是，誰都不説話，只有樹葉動摇着的聲音，只有風的聲音。天上没有月亮，也没有星，是一個黑暗的夜。波爾加河流已經消失在黑暗裏了。</p>
<p>我們全立了起來，圍立了漢尼爾的四周。燈火燃明了每個人凄切的臉。全沉默着。</p>
<p>五月的夜風在嘆息，叢林也在哭泣着了。</p>
<p>誰提起鐵剷，剷下第一剷呢？泥土將吞食了我們親切的旅伴！</p>
<p>我的血液緊張了起來，像一根有刺的鐵推沉重地擊在我的心上，我丢了手裏的鐵剷，抱了頭癱軟地坐到地上去。</p>
<p>泥土終於吞食了漢尼爾了，他躺在那插着木製的斧頭與鐮刀的土堆下面了。</p>
<p>大家圍着土堆坐了下來，低着頭，連嘆息也没有。</p>
<p>風摇着椰子樹，椰子樹在“咯，咯……”地凄凉地歌唱。天上没有星月，黑暗的夜呵，波爾加河消失在黑暗裏了，無邊的黑暗，無盡地黑夜呵。漢尼爾没有了，遠方的西班牙的好心的同志們，對漢尼爾也將永遠是猜疑，期待，戀念，是一個謎了。</p>
<p>無邊的黑暗，無盡的黑夜呵，黑暗的波爾加河流的夜，凄切的椰子林呵，行旅者們圍坐着，行着，凄凉的葬禮！</p>
<h3>海之歌</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>滿天星斗底夜，海又在那兒歌唱着了。</p>
<p>海本來生成便是個天才的歌者，它有詩人一樣的熱情，烈士一樣的悲壯，像一匹奔馬，風馳電掣地捲起一浪，又一浪，什麽也阻不了它；這些浪，也可以形容説是它的聲威。</p>
<p>海是世界上第一個勞動者。它縱然是到了息力的時候，也要掙扎地擺動着它巨無覇的身體，伸展着它的四肢，不甘示弱。</p>
<p>岸濱的岩石一陣一陣地加厚着，然而，這就能停止海的震嘯和湧撞了嗎？每個時間，仍用着它好勇的性子，把腦袋拚命向岩石撞。日久了，那岩石漸漸起了戰慄，它受不了海牙的磨折，一個堅硬的身子給吞成懦弱的模樣，徒增了外形的秀麗。</p>
<p>海，永遠不息地歌唱着奮鬥着。</p>
<p>海，是有着自由的奔濤，以及無休止的雄心呵！</p>

<h3>Sudden Tension in Tokyo Regarding China</h3>
<p>Various Newspapers Make Inflammatory Propaganda, Carrying Provocative News for Days, Believing the Chinese Government Has Begun Changing Things in North China, and the Qingdao Tax Police Change of Guard Has Even Become a Pretext for Them</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The atmosphere here regarding China has suddenly become tense, further heightened by the issuance of extra editions by various newspapers. According to these extra editions, two Japanese fishing boats were shot at by Chinese tax police in the Bohai Sea. This kind of provocative news, coinciding with the dispatch of special commissioners from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army to China for inspection and the military officials' meeting in Tianjin, is quite noteworthy. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The northward journey of Chinese Minister of Interior Jiang Zuobin and Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Feng Yuxiang, the return of Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council Song Zheyuan to his post, and the meeting between Vice Chairman Feng and Chairman of Shandong Han Fuqu in Tai'an have triggered extremely nervous speculation here, believing that the Chinese Central Government has practically begun changing things in North China. Meanwhile, regarding the Shandong tax police issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes there are no temporary diplomatic problems, but the military still considers this a serious issue. This morning, newspapers here have excessively exaggerated the publicity of the Shantou Japanese Consulate Police incident, especially the report of Japanese destroyers sailing to Shantou, which is most alarming. Many newspapers have used the most inflammatory language to report the above news, in order to stir up the same atmosphere as after the Hankou incident last autumn. However, the actual trend does not seem to be preparing to launch a serious situation. Previously, the government here seemed to spare no effort in exaggerating the so-called anti-Japanese sentiment in China, in order to, on the one hand, change the intense anti-government sentiment at home, and on the other hand, create reasons to request the inclusion of larger military expenditures when drafting the next fiscal year's national budget. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese newspapers point out that recent frequent Sino-Japanese conflicts within China have greatly damaged Sino-Japanese relations. They especially emphasize the development arising from the case of the Shantou police detaining a Japanese consulate police officer. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the situation in Shantou is serious. Rear Admiral Okuma has already rushed to Shantou on a flagship from Lushun, and three Japanese destroyers sailed from Xiamen to Shantou yesterday. If necessary, sailors will be sent ashore. Meanwhile, Japanese Consul-General to Guangzhou Nakamura is currently negotiating with representatives of the Guangdong government to resolve the matter. The case of a Chinese customs patrol boat firing at a Japanese fishing boat outside Dalian on May 23, injuring crew members, is also attracting much attention. Furthermore, Japanese reports of large numbers of Chinese soldiers intruding into the Qingdao area and assaulting Japanese people in Jiaozhou Bay are also making Sino-Japanese relations increasingly strained. The Kokumin Shimbun claims that Japan, in order to maintain Sino-Japanese friendship, has adopted a moderate attitude towards the Chengdu case, etc., but the recent events in Shantou have completely demonstrated China's lack of sincerity, making it impossible for Japan to seek a compromise through ordinary negotiations. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs apparently has no choice but to study a practical method to obtain a fundamental solution. The Asahi Shimbun claims that Chinese police have apparently forgotten that Japanese people in China enjoy extraterritoriality. The news of the detention of a Japanese police officer in Shantou has dimmed the prospects for progress in Sino-Japanese relations. (26th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Shantou Incident is Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato Reports on the Progress at the Cabinet Meeting, Our Foreign Ministry Orders the Special Commissioner to Guangdong to Investigate</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Li Hanhun returned to Shantou on the "Haili" on the 26th. Wu Tiecheng ordered Shantou Mayor Huang Bingdong to return to Shantou and negotiate with the Japanese consul, adhering to the principle of safeguarding sovereignty. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Shantou] The case of Japanese residents of Shantou, Aoyama Kiyoshi, etc., moving residences on the 21st, refusing to register their households, and assaulting police officers is still under negotiation between the Shantou authorities and the Japanese consul. The Japanese Navy Commander stationed in Taiwan, Okuma, arrived in Shantou on the "Yubari" on the 26th, anchoring in the sea. There are now a total of four Japanese warships. The people of Shantou believe that the fault lies with the Japanese side, and the public is calm as usual. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Japanese Consul-General to Guangdong, Toyoichi Nakamura, paid visits to the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Ouyang Ju, at 11 AM and 4 PM on the 26th, and had discussions regarding the case of Japanese residents of Shantou, Aoyama Kiyoshi, etc., refusing to register their households and assaulting police officers. As a result, both sides shared the same view that the incident was minor and did not want to escalate the situation. It is heard that the competent officials from both sides intend to study a solution based on the principle of peace. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese cabinet held a regular meeting at 11:45 AM this morning. Foreign Minister Sato reported on the progress of the Shantou incident, stating that the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hidaka, and the Consul in Guangzhou, Nakamura, had already lodged protests with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Guangdong Provincial Government respectively. In addition, one Japanese cruiser and three destroyers have sailed to Shantou. It is heard that the Foreign Minister expressed his opinion that this incident can be resolved peacefully, and therefore, the cabinet members currently agreed to entrust the Foreign Minister with the handling of this incident. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the change of guard of tax police near Qingdao and the refusal of Japanese residents in Shantou to complete household registration transfer procedures and assaulting our police officers, Japanese newspapers have been excessively publicizing these events in recent days. It is also heard that three Japanese warships have sailed towards Shantou. In order to clarify the situation, the reporter specifically inquired with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who explained the truth of these two matters separately as follows: ㊀ The Shandong Jiao'ao salt area has always had a battalion of tax police stationed there. On the 2nd of this month, the Ministry of Finance transferred the battalion back to Haizhou and dispatched the 5th Regiment of tax police to fill the position. This move was due to the increase in salt tax in order to prevent smuggling, so one or two more battalions were added to strengthen the anti-smuggling force. However, the Japanese Consul-General in Qingdao, not understanding this intention, actually protested to the Qingdao Municipal Government, demanding that the Central Government withdraw the force. At the same time, the Japanese newspapers in Qingdao fabricated the fact that the tax police were oppressing Koreans and made provocative attacks on the Shandong and Qingdao provincial and municipal governments, making one suspect that they were intentionally looking for trouble, which is truly regrettable. Chinese armed forces are free to transfer and station troops within their own territory, and there is no room for interference from outsiders. Moreover, the duty of the tax police is only to suppress smuggling, and there is really no need to panic. ㊁ A Japanese resident of Shantou City, Aoyama Kiyoshi, did not follow police regulations to apply for an entry permit and forcibly moved into the second floor of the Shenzhou Foreign Firm on Yongping Road, under the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct, on the 22nd of this month. The police officers advised him to stop, but he instead assaulted each of the police officers. The police then took the Japanese resident to the bureau and sent him to the municipal government. The municipal government released him to the Japanese consul that evening and made demands to the Japanese consul such as punishing the assailant. The above is the report received by this Ministry regarding this case up to the present time. Now, in order to clarify the detailed situation, this Ministry has recently telegraphed the Special Commissioner stationed in Guangdong, Diao Zuqian, to go to Shantou immediately to investigate everything. It is expected that this case can be resolved appropriately soon based on accurate facts. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun commented on the Shantou incident today, attributing the root cause of this incident to the anger of the local Chinese people towards smuggling, especially that conducted by Koreans. Regarding the cause of the current incident, the newspaper first stated that there are still several points that are not very clear. If the reports transmitted here from Shantou, Guangzhou, and Shanghai are correct, that is, the insult to the Japanese police officer Aoyama is accurate, then the Chinese side has clearly neglected the fact that Japanese people in China enjoy consular jurisdiction, and this direct action against Japanese people is the most serious violation of treaty rights. However, there is one point that needs our research, that is, the smuggling constantly carried out by Koreans in Shantou may seriously misuse our rights of consular jurisdiction. The current incident, that is, the Chinese police entering a Japanese company and insulting the Japanese police officer Aoyama, is indeed an illegal action by the Chinese side. But is there no such fact there, such as Koreans' smuggling causing unnecessary irritation to the Chinese people in peacetime? Furthermore, as a result, does it not cause the Chinese people to harbor resentment against the Japanese police, whose duty is to protect Japanese residents? Therefore, in handling the current incident, in addition to expressing a strong attitude, we should study its root cause. In other words, we should review the above-mentioned general atmosphere regarding the current incident and formulate fundamental countermeasures. In conclusion, the newspaper faithfully advises the Japanese government to conduct a reasonable solution to the urgent issue of smuggling, and believes that the prerequisite for solving this problem is the reduction of Chinese tax rates. Finally, the newspaper hopes that the clarification of this issue can greatly improve Sino-Japanese relations. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Denies Patrol Boat Interception of Japanese Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Claims Two Fishing Boats Were Chased, Captain of "Choshu Maru" Was Injured by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Tianjin Customs denied the Japanese claim that customs patrol boats intercepted Japanese fishing boats No. 1 Choshu Maru and No. 7 Shima户Maru 18 nautical miles outside Tanggu and that the captain of Choshu Maru, Takasaki, was injured in his left arm. The spokesperson stated that the Customs did not send two patrol boats to cruise outside Tanggu on the 23rd or encounter and intercept Japanese fishing boats. The Japanese side claimed that the fishing boat No. 1 Choshu Maru, weighing 43 tons, and No. 7 Shima户Maru, weighing 49 tons, both owned by Taro Noguchi of Jippu County, encountered two customs patrol boats at 2 PM on the 23rd, 18 nautical miles east of the Tanggu lighthouse. The two boats turned around and fled, and the customs patrol boats chased and fired shots. The Choshu Maru fell behind and was hit by more than a dozen bullets in the stern. The captain, Takasaki, was injured in his left arm by a stray bullet at this time. Because the boat stopped, the patrol boats approached, searched it, and then the boat and the Shima户Maru sailed back to Dalian and reported to their government. The Customs has not received any report regarding this incident from the 23rd to the present. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Two gunboats of the Japanese Kwantung State Fisheries Association sailed out of Dalian on the 26th and cruised in the Bohai Bay and the sea off Tanggu, saying that in view of the Choshu Maru incident, they were specially protecting fishing boats. (26th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ronin Forcibly Occupy Tianjin Xiaoximen Branch Card</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Inspectors and Police Chiefs, Seizing Swords and Guns and Refusing to Return Them, We Protested but Received No Reply</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to news from Tianjin, around midnight on the 12th of this month, about 40 to 50 Japanese ronin, armed with weapons, mostly knives and sticks, forcibly occupied the Tianjin Customs Xiaoximen branch card. They imprisoned two customs officers at the branch card and the police chief and police officers sent by the Public Security Bureau, not allowing them freedom of movement. When they were about to leave, they kidnapped Wu Hongqing, the investigator of the branch card, and the police chief of the Anti-Public Security Bureau and confiscated two rifles and a small knife from the police team. After receiving the report, the Tianjin Customs immediately sent the acting deputy inspector, a Japanese named Isa Ushinokuke, accompanied by several customs officers to inspect the branch card. When the deputy inspector arrived at the branch card, the Japanese ronin had already taken the detained customs officers away from the branch card to the Japanese Concession. Afterwards, the deputy inspector went to the Japanese Concession to find the detained personnel. It was later found out that the investigator and the police chief were hidden in the Japanese company Yitai Foreign Firm. After some negotiation, the two people were released from the foreign firm, but the rifles and small knife that had been confiscated were not returned. According to the deputy inspector, the Japanese ronin stated that the weapons must be returned by the Japanese military authorities or the Japanese Consulate General. It was also reported that when the Japanese ronin occupied the branch card, ten trucks, loaded with smuggled goods, took the opportunity to break through the card and go inland. After this case occurred, it is heard that the authorities protested to the Japanese Consul General stationed in Tianjin, demanding that the troublemaking ronin be severely punished and the weapons returned. The Japanese Consul General has not yet replied. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Urges Reporting of Construction Plans</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan previously ordered the provincial governments in August of last year to prepare provincial multi-phase construction core work plans starting from fiscal year 25 and submit them for approval. Provinces with administrative inspectorate districts should also prepare district multi-phase construction core work plans, and issued a table to be filled out and reported. In February of this year, they re-telegraphed to urge their submission. Currently, some provinces have not been able to faithfully comply with these instructions. Recently, five key points were re-emphasized and strictly ordered to be handled quickly and faithfully. The organization regulations for the core work review committees for provincial and municipal construction have recently been ordered to be abolished by the Executive Yuan. However, in the future, when provinces submit construction core work planned schedule tables and implementation report tables, eight copies of each should still be attached to facilitate review. The provincial governments have recently been instructed to be informed. (26th Central News Telegram)</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The remedial measures for civil service qualification examination in various provinces and cities, proposed by the Examination Yuan, were passed by the Central Political Council on the morning of the 26th.

If necessary, it may be extended once, still limited to six months. ㊄ After this supplementary screening registration of civil servants, all provinces and cities shall strictly enforce the deadlines for submission for approval of civil servant appointments and the methods for disbursing salaries, and shall not request remedies on any grounds. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 26th, Ms. Chen Bijun, a member of the Central Committee, proposed to the Central Political Council that the Ministry of Education be instructed to promptly formulate standardized hats for female students at all levels of schools and to universally order their wearing. The proposal has been passed to the Executive Yuan. The original text of the proposal is recorded as follows: On the matter of proposal, clothing is for covering the body, hats are for covering the head; the two are equally important, regardless of gender. In ancient China, women had hats, as can be seen in the classics, clearly documented. Later, seclusion became the custom. However, rural women, due to their labor, such as engaging in farming and mulberry cultivation, and even undertaking carrying tasks, invariably wore bamboo hats, or added cloth brims under the hats, to shield from the wind in winter and from the sun in summer, greatly benefiting the maintenance of physical health. As for urban women, due to living secluded lives, they felt there was no need to wear hats. In recent decades, the custom of female seclusion has gradually faded, but considering that European and American women's hat-making always complements their facial features, with styles varying from person to person, people are both daunted by the difficulty and fear opening up extravagant habits. Therefore, the wearing of hats by women has not yet become common. Because of this, they are exposed to wind in winter and heat in summer, damaging their health and harming their bodies, truly a case of penny-wise, pound-foolish. Observe the male and female students in winter and summer, when attending ceremonies, gathering in squares, or parading in streets. Female students often have the appearance of lowering their heads and furrowing their brows. It is not that their physique is weaker than that of male students, but simply because their heads are not covered, exposed to fierce winds in winter and scorching sun in summer, leading to this appearance. As for illnesses resulting from this, who but their relatives would know? Recently, due to the organization of Boy Scouts and the implementation of military training, female students participating all wear standardized hats and benefit greatly from them. However, outside of Boy Scouts and military training, there are no standardized hats to wear, which intensifies their feelings of inconvenience. For the sake of female students nationwide, it is appropriate for the Ministry of Education to promptly formulate standardized hats for female students at all levels and universally order their wearing. The styles may be simple, the materials must be domestic goods, and the primary purpose should be to shield from wind and sun. Once female students universally wear them, their impact on all women will be profound and far-reaching. If this becomes widespread among the people, the benefits to the cultivation of physique and the improvement of health will be immense. This proposal is respectfully submitted for public decision. Committee Member Chen Bijun. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

(Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chu Minyi, the leader of the Beijing-Yunnan Highway Tour Group, accompanied by group members Zhou Longqian, Wang Yang, and nine others, arrived in Nanjing from Hankou at about 11:00 AM on the 26th, after a two-month, ten-thousand-mile tour. Wu Zhihui, Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, Madame Wang, Chen Bijun, Zhang Tong, Madame Chu, her sons and daughters, and over a hundred representatives from various groups and relatives and friends, all came to the steamer to warmly welcome them. Chu and the group members, returning from ten thousand miles, landed in high spirits and expressed their gratitude one by one. Reporters greeted them at the steamer to congratulate them on the success of the long tour. Chu then entered the city to visit Chairman Wang and report on the tour. The group members also returned to their respective agencies to report the completion of the tour mission. In the afternoon, Chu visited Wei Daoming at the Executive Yuan for a long discussion, attended the Standing Committee meeting of the National Games at 2:30 PM, inspected the handicraft exhibition at 3:00 PM, and visited Qin Fen at 5:00 PM. He went to the National Assembly Election Headquarters to handle official business, scheduled a visit to Wang Chonghui on the 27th, and telegraphed President Chiang to report the completion of the mission and request an audience date. This reporter revisited Chu in the afternoon to discuss the tour. Chu first stated that the tour group initiated by President Chiang departed from Nanjing on the 5th of last month, passing through eight provinces, a total of over 11,000 li, taking 52 days, and completing its mission today. During this time, all members did not hesitate to travel, and were able to fulfill their tour missions. Along the way, they received warm receptions, welcomes, and assistance from the local governments and people of various provinces, which made the tour a smooth success. He was extremely grateful and pleased. This trip passed through the counties, cities, and towns of six provinces, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi. Everywhere they went, the enthusiastically welcoming people and the trained and organized strong men cheered on the streets, often numbering in the tens of thousands, demonstrating the people's love for the central government and the popularization of national consciousness among the people, which was inspiring. The group also took this opportunity to give various speeches, conveying the central government's intentions, which greatly moved the audience. Secondly, the consistent efforts of the governments and people of various provinces to advance various new construction projects towards a bright future are even more gratifying. However, due to the limited itinerary, they only stopped for two or three days in places like Nanchang, Changsha, Guiyang, and Guilin. In Kunming, they stayed for eight days due to Chairman Long's retention. Although the time was short, the group directly and indirectly obtained a considerable amount of material. He plans to request the Executive Yuan to form an editorial committee, composed of the group's leaders, deputy leaders, group leaders, general secretaries, deputy secretaries, and reporters from various newspapers participating in the tour, to compile materials from various departments and prepare a general report, accompanied by photographs, for reference by the central government and the people of the country. The local specialties and photographs obtained will be used to hold an exhibition in the future, so that the people of Nanjing can observe and appreciate them. Finally, the reporter inquired about the situation in each province separately. Chu stated that the people in the Jiao Xuan area of Anhui Province are active and agile. Jiangxi Province, after the banditry, is striving for construction and full of emerging atmosphere. Hunan Province is inherently a rich area, with simple folk customs, and the people are especially able to endure hardship and work hard. Although Yunnan is far away on the border, it is not different in spirit from the recent provinces, and the local villages are settled. Guangxi Province is united from top to bottom, there are no beggars in the whole province, and the people are able to live and work in peace. Both Yunnan and Guangxi provinces are rich in copper and tin and other products, and export a lot every year. In addition, the people are thrifty and consume very little, so they are the only provinces in the country that have trade surpluses. However, Guizhou Province is not affluent, and after the banditry two years ago, it was followed by a five-month drought this year, so the disaster situation is severe. The province originally had a saying, "No three days of sunshine in the sky, no three feet of flat land, no three taels of silver for the people." Even without disasters, people's lives are already very difficult. Now, in the face of a major disaster, relief cannot be delayed. Fortunately, when the group arrived in Guizhou, heavy clouds suddenly appeared from east to west (usually in Guizhou Province, it rains a lot, and clouds always move from west to east), and then there was timely rain, so agriculture could be slightly revived, and the people were happy. The reporter laughed and said that the clouds were escorting the tour group westward, no wonder the people of Guizhou Province felt that the spiritual rain had saved the people. The reporter then took leave of Chu. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Desirable Approach to Resolving the Far Eastern Question</h3>
<p>For several weeks, the Far Eastern question has shown a tendency towards rapid change due to the British Imperial Conference, the concretization of Anglo-Japanese negotiations, and the travels of our country's special envoy, Kong Xiangxi, between London and Geneva. Furthermore, Australian Prime Minister Lyons' proposal for a Pacific regional security agreement at the Imperial Conference has become the focus of international attention. Although the current situation has not yet reached the point of convening a Pacific conference to seek a comprehensive resolution to the Far Eastern question, it is now a more hopeful time since the September 18th Incident. Of course, if Japan goes astray and does not know how to return, if the United States continues to adopt a hands-off approach, if Britain harbors thoughts of temporary ease, and if China is still unable to unite internally, the possibility of such a resolution is extremely slim. Assuming that the time is gradually ripening, we must have a common understanding and belief regarding the approach to be taken for a comprehensive resolution of the Far Eastern question.</p>
<p>This approach should include three points: First, the methods of monopolizing or partitioning China are absolutely useless. Equal opportunity and the open door, under the principles and realities of China's sovereign independence and territorial integrity, are permissible. Second, recognizing that a strong and prosperous China is the best guarantee of peace in the Far East, all issues must be premised on China's interests. All existing conditions detrimental to China must be broken. Third, a permanent and practical solution should be sought, rather than a superficial and temporary one. Collective peace must be supported by international forces and cannot rely solely on the signatures of various countries. A treaty without real strength as a backdrop, no matter how perfect, will always end up as waste paper in the hands of militarists.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, some people who have discussed the Far Eastern question in the past have advocated monopolizing China, such as the East Asian Monroe Doctrine proposed by Japan, especially the various propositions included in the 1934 Amau Doctrine. Some have advocated partitioning China, such as the so-called recognition of a certain country's special interests in a certain region before the Washington Conference, and the recent division of spheres of influence advocated by Japanese newspapers, "Japan in North China and Britain in Central and South China." The British government has formally denied this, as Foreign Secretary Eden recently stated to Kong Xiangxi that Anglo-Japanese negotiations would never harm China's interests. Apart from monopolization and partitioning, there is the joint development of China by the great powers. This approach can be accepted under the conditions that China has a strong central government and independent capabilities. Premier Sun already had a plan to use foreign capital to develop China, and the current government has repeatedly stated that it welcomes cooperation with all countries in the world. Special Envoy Kong's work in London roughly focused on obtaining the joint cooperation of various countries in the financial and economic fields. In the political field, we should welcome countries along the Pacific to jointly negotiate and build a Pacific collective security system, and China is certainly willing to bear the greatest responsibility and obligation for maintaining order in the Far East.</p>
<p>Second, China is the core of the Far Eastern question, and China's strength is the greatest guarantee of peace in the Far East. Therefore, any issue should be considered with the freedom, equality, revival, and self-strengthening of the Chinese nation as the standard. We cannot take maintaining the status quo as a solution, nor can we recognize any fait accompli. When the Washington Treaty was signed in 1922, all countries had already realized this. Therefore, no country was allowed to take advantage of China's weakness at the time to hinder China's nation-building efforts. Now that China has a unified and strong government, and political and social order has been stabilized, lasting peace in the Far East has already shown a glimmer of hope due to China's unification. The strengthening of this glimmer depends on the Chinese nation being freed from its current shackles. From China's perspective, it should be recognized that Heaven helps those who help themselves and strive for self-improvement. From the perspective of the great powers related to the Far East, they should also recognize that this great nation cannot be permanently subjected to inequality and aggression. The recovery of lost territories and the abolition of unequal treaties are China's reasonable demands and the prerequisites for peace.</p>
<p>Finally, all solutions must have real strength to maintain them and cannot completely rely on the credibility and goodwill of any country. The Washington Nine-Power Treaty became a waste of paper because there was no power of sanctions. Although there were provisions for mutual consultation in the Four-Power Treaty, there was no real organization to deal with problems that arise at any time. Therefore, to seek a thorough resolution to the Far Eastern question, there must not only be a collective security system but also an organized and powerful collective security system. Without steps and power to sanction aggression, security is a tower in the sand. What China demands is not only security, but also security built on justice.</p>
<h3>Paris-Tokyo Flight Fails, French Plane Crashes in Kochi Prefecture</h3>
<p>Two Aviators Injured, Fuselage Destroyed, Adversity All the Way Since Continuing Flight from Shanghai</p>
<p>⊙Kochi: An airplane wreckage was discovered near Tohara Beach, Muroki Village, Agawa District, Kochi Prefecture, appearing to be a Duralumin aircraft; currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Another dispatch at 8:25 PM: The Duralumin aircraft landed at Hinohara Beach, Muroki Village, Agawa District, Kochi Prefecture at 7:30 PM this afternoon. The two occupants sustained minor injuries and have been admitted to Oishi Hospital in the village, where they are undergoing surgery. Yet another dispatch at 10:25 PM: The Duralumin aircraft that overturned at Tohara Beach, two miles south of Kochi, has suffered extensive damage to its fuselage. The right wing has nearly separated from the engine, while the left wing remains intact, battered by the waves. Villagers are maintaining watch throughout the night. Yet another dispatch at 10:45 PM: Mr. Dural is bandaged on his face, while Mr. Michele-Dit has a minor forehead injury. Despite their serious injuries, these aerial heroes are drinking and smoking, conversing animatedly, saying, "Since taking off from Shanghai at 1:30 PM today, we have been in constant distress, flying westward from the homeland to the east, then turning back westward. This time, when we tried to head east again, we saw a sandy beach and decided to land. Although we have overcome numerous difficulties to reach this point, it is regrettable that our goal has not been achieved." He could not help but burst into tears as he spoke.</p>
<p>Yet another dispatch at 11:40 PM: Mr. Dural and Mr. Michele-Dit were transported to the Japanese Red Cross Hospital in Kochi City by car at 10 PM this evening and are receiving formal treatment. Although both remain in good spirits, Mr. Dural's injuries will require ten days to fully recover, while Mr. Michele-Dit will also require a week of recuperation. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French aviators Dural and Michele-Dit, flying from Paris to Tokyo, attempted to complete the entire journey in 100 hours to set a new record and claim the government's 400,000-franc prize. Unfortunately, near the Taiwan Strait, due to adverse weather conditions, they were forced to turn back to Guangzhou Bay, scheduled to take off again on the morning of the 26th. They had to reach Tokyo before 9:05 AM on the 26th to stay within the limit, but this was impossible. Therefore, Mr. Dural and Mr. Michele-Dit's plan has been declared a failure. (National Maritime News Agency dispatch dated the 25th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After receiving news of Mr. Dural's plane arriving in Shanghai, the French Embassy believed that the ambition of "Aviation France" could reach far this time, and the situation was very tense. Ambassador Henri and all the embassy staff went to Haneda Airport to wait. The Imperial Aviation Association also began various welcome preparations. However, after checking, the Dural plane had been in the air for 93 hours and 54 minutes from its departure from Paris to noon on the 26th. Therefore, it could not reach the 100-hour record unless it flew to Haneda before 6:06 PM (Tokyo time) on the 26th. The remaining distance between Shanghai and Tokyo is 1,770 kilometers. According to the performance of the "Caudron Simon" aircraft, the fastest time required is seven and a half hours. Therefore, whether it can win the championship is of great concern. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<h3>Situation of Passing Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>(Local News) French aviators Dural and Michele-Dit arrived in Shanghai at 10:05 AM yesterday morning, rested for an hour, and continued their flight. Unexpectedly, the tire was damaged, causing another delay, and they only managed to take off at 12:35 PM. If there were no problems along the way, they could reach their destination before 5:30 PM. Mr. Dural and Mr. Michele-Dit could have passed Shanghai yesterday, but they were delayed for about ten hours near Fort Bayard in Guangzhou Bay due to a mechanical obstruction. They only managed to repair the aircraft and the coastal weather had also improved. They took off at 2:00 AM yesterday morning, and arrived in Shanghai at 10:05 AM without any obstacles along the way. They landed safely at Longhua Airport amidst the enthusiastic welcome of fifty or so French and Chinese officials and civilians. The aircraft driven by the two men was a "Caudron" Simon monoplane, silver-white all over, painted with red characters, and the wings and tail were also painted with red stripes. The nose of the plane was very long, and the cockpit was in the front, accommodating only two people, with a storage compartment in the back. The two aviators were dressed in blue flight suits, looking energetic. After getting off the plane, they shook hands with French Consul-General Patard, French Municipal Council Director-General Weizhi Cheng, Police Commissioner Fabre, and others who came to welcome them, and after briefly having drinks and snacks, they inspected the aircraft and added fuel and oil in preparation for the continuation of their flight. Although there were still dark clouds in the city yesterday morning, and it was alternately sunny and rainy, according to a telegram from Tokyo, the coastal weather had improved, and it was estimated that the journey from Shanghai to Tokyo would take about five hours. Therefore, they started the engine at 11:15 AM and continued their flight. Unexpectedly, after circling the airport half a time, the tire deflated, causing a tire to sink into the ground, and stopped at the eastern end of the airport. French expatriates and Chinese and Eurasian company mechanics at the airport helped to repair it. For a while, the airport was filled with the tense movement of cars, because if it could not be repaired within an hour, the effort would be wasted. After replacing the old tire, the flight took off at 13:35, delaying about an hour. It must reach Tokyo before 6:00 PM to create this difficult and dangerous new record. However, last night, the French consulate received news that it did not arrive in Kagoshima until about 8:30 PM in the evening, so the two men were ultimately unable to achieve their wishes. However, this was entirely due to bad weather and repeated setbacks, and their spirit is especially worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Economic Front Against China</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Convened a Meeting of Bankers, Focusing Discussions on Clearing Old Debts</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and bankers involved in investments in China held a meeting at 3:00 PM today. The attendees included Hioki, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Uemura, Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau, Kanohara, Director of the Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Umeura, Chief of the National Finance Section of the Finance Bureau (representing the government), Kawakami, Vice President of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Kamada, Chief of the Economics Section, Komori, Vice President of the Bank of Korea, Yamamoto, Director of the Bank of Taiwan, Yoshihara, Chief of the Reorganization Section, Yamahira, General Manager of the First Bank, Noda, Manager of the Tokyo Branch of Sumitomo Bank (representing the banking sector). It is reported that the representatives exchanged opinions, focusing on the issue of clearing old debts. No specific plans were agreed upon regarding the issue of issuing new loans to China. However, since the Japanese government is determined to promote the so-called economic cooperation with China, it has planned to establish appropriate agencies in the ports of the Yangtze River basin, and has acquired private banks in Shanghai and Hankou, sending economic envoys to China, establishing an economic and commercial section in the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy in China, and establishing a China Economic Research Section in the Research Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Due to the above-mentioned activities, today's meeting can be regarded, at a minimum, as a liaison for various preparations to strengthen Japan's economic front against China. (Central News Agency dispatch dated the 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Although the Japanese government is very willing to compete with Britain, the United States, and Germany for loans to China, it has encountered the serious problem of mobilizing domestic surplus funds, because the surplus funds have been exhausted by the expansion of the military industry. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited representatives of the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, the Bank of Taiwan, Sumitomo, and the First Bank, which are related to investment in China, to hold a meeting today to explore their opinions on loans to China. Although some aspects expressed optimism about this, financial circles revealed that today's discussions still focused on dealing with various old debts to China, hoping that the Chinese government would repay the old debts as newly recognized debts. However, some credit loan issues were also discussed. (Reuters dispatch dated the 26th from Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Mussolini Says Italy Needs Peace</h3>
<p>Believes Abolishing Armaments Is Not Yet the Time, Responds to Hull's Remarks to the United States</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met today with Sims, a diplomatic reporter from the Howard newspaper group in the United States, saying that if President Roosevelt convenes an international disarmament conference, Italy will wholeheartedly support it, and all countries in the world will participate. The current arms race will be difficult to sustain, and if it is not stopped soon, the whole world will fall into economic bankruptcy. Italy also needs peace in order to develop its existing resources. "I do not advocate abolishing armaments, but advocate limiting armaments, because abolishing armaments is not yet the time, but limiting armaments can be implemented."

<h3>League of Nations Assembly Opens</h3>
<p>Turkish Representative Elected as Chairman, Egypt's Accession Likely to Be Approved, Albania Excluded from the Meeting</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Temporary Assembly opened at 11:00 AM today, chaired by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, also the representative of Ecuador, Dr. Geoffroy. (Note: The new League of Nations building has been completed, and the League of Nations Assembly is holding its meeting at the old site, which is the last time.) He gave a speech saying that the reason for convening the Temporary Assembly was because Egypt requested to join the League of Nations as a member state, and he was honored to be appointed as chairman. The vitality of the League of Nations has been further demonstrated. The government of Ecuador will remain loyal to the League of Nations as always. Polish representative Komarnicki spoke, mentioning the fact that the Emperor of Abyssinia did not send a delegation, saying that from the perspective of the Polish government, this issue had been resolved before the General Assembly held its regular meeting in September. The representative of Mexico said that the Mexican government opposed any member state wanting to expel its membership. No other representatives requested to speak. The Temporary Assembly then elected a chairman, Turkish representative, the country's Foreign Minister Rushdi, who won 46 votes out of 49 and was elected. After taking office as chairman, Rushdi also gave a speech expressing his gratitude. The Assembly then organized a committee to discuss Egypt's accession to the League of Nations, which is expected to be approved, and the Assembly will also approve Egypt as a member state this afternoon. (Havas dispatch dated the 26th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Emperor of Abyssinia recently sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, stating that after consulting with the ministers of his cabinet, he has now decided not to send a delegation to the League of Nations Temporary Assembly. The Emperor congratulated Egypt on its imminent accession to the League of Nations, and said that Abyssinia and Egypt have maintained the closest relationship for hundreds of years. The last paragraph of the Emperor's note stated that "Although Abyssinia has suffered terrible misfortunes, as a member state of the League of Nations, it still hopes that the League of Nations will eventually liberate Abyssinia's territory so that it will no longer be occupied by foreign countries. As for myself, I am ready to cooperate with the League of Nations at any time in order to establish international peace and justice. When Italy forcefully invaded Abyssinia, the League of Nations attempted to implement collective sanctions, but failed to carry them through to the end. One wrong step not only completely abandoned the people of Abyssinia, making them prey to the invaders, but also disintegrated the interior of Europe, and Spain was subjected to invasion. The consequences are such." This note was sent from Bath, England, signed by Emperor Selassie I and countersigned by the Abyssinian Foreign Minister Heruy.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Open Meeting</h3>
<p>Passed Multiple Reports</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting this afternoon, which lasted a very short time before adjourning. At the meeting, the Administrative Council expressed its condolences for the recent death of former British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, with speeches by the Chairman of Ecuador, Mr. Geoffroy, and the French representative, Foreign Minister Daladier, praising Chamberlain's contributions to European peace. This was followed by a thank you from British Foreign Secretary Eden, who said that when the late British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain, the late French Foreign Minister Briand, and the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann worked together, the League of Nations was almost able to implement its ideal of peace, but failed at the last hurdle. At this point, the Administrative Council passed several reports from various expert committees without discussion, namely ㊀ the report of the Committee on the Sale of Slaves, ㊁ the report of the Committee on the Suppression of the Sale of White Women, and ㊂ the report of the Committee on the Termination of the Nansen Refugee Relief Committee.

<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph naval correspondent learned from reliable sources that the British mainland and the dominion navies will cooperate closely. The plan to strengthen the British fleet in China will be drafted as soon as possible. The Hong Kong fortress will be modernized, and Singapore will become the main base for the Pacific fleet. The Australian and New Zealand navies will also participate in Singapore's exercises. The Australian navy will add a destroyer squadron with a small cruiser as the flagship, and will order a new cruiser from Britain as soon as possible. The New Zealand navy will also expand at the same time. The correspondent said that the dominion representatives are quite concerned about the security of the imperial sea lanes, especially in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, because various countries have expanded their navies. However, naval circles believe that after the rearmament plan is implemented, the security of the sea lanes will not need to be worried about.

<h3>The British Plan to Mediate the Spanish Civil War Fails</h3>
<p>Withdrawal of Volunteers in Spain Faces Many Difficulties</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Spanish delegation attending the League of Nations today told a Reuters reporter that it intends to vigorously support the British representative's proposal to withdraw volunteers from Spain, and that there can be no ceasefire or reconciliation until the proposal is generally agreed upon in principle. If a temporary ceasefire is necessary in the future for the withdrawal of volunteers, it can be discussed at length. The only proposal that the Spanish delegation can accept today is the withdrawal of volunteers. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>[London] The sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War recently appointed a committee of experts to study the implementation of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries in Spain. The committee of experts has now submitted a report, which has been sent by the delegations of various countries to their respective governments for review. It is generally believed that it will take at least two or three months for the withdrawal plan to be implemented, and the cost will be more than £1.1 million. Moreover, the matter must be accepted by the belligerent parties in the Spanish Civil War and the international committee must handle the withdrawal within their respective jurisdictions. The tasks of this committee are to investigate the method of withdrawal and to monitor the implementation of the withdrawal plan. As for the method of withdrawal, it roughly involves transferring foreign volunteers from the front lines to the rear in batches, and replacing them with Spanish troops. Volunteers from various countries should be concentrated in designated locations and then sent to various ports to return to their home countries by ship. However, this method faces many difficulties in practice. The most prominent of these are: first, the volunteers on both sides of the civil war must withdraw simultaneously; second, the number of volunteers withdrawn on both sides must be roughly equal; and third, all volunteers from various countries who are essential for offensive and defensive operations on the front lines must also be withdrawn. Regarding this point, the Nationalist forces need many foreign volunteers in their offensive against Bilbao and its surrounding areas in the Basque Country, while the government forces rely on the assistance of foreign volunteers to consolidate their defenses in the Madrid area. Both of these situations make withdrawal difficult. The British government is well aware of the many obstacles to withdrawing volunteers from the front lines of both sides, and therefore suggested that the two sides in the civil war temporarily cease hostilities. However, regarding this proposal, the countries concerned have not yet fully responded, but it can already be considered a failure. Therefore, the current issue lies in what attitude the countries concerned and the belligerent parties in the Spanish Civil War will adopt towards the report submitted by the committee of experts.

<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Arctic Flight Nationwide</h3>
<p>Three More Planes Arrive at North Pole Station; Public Opinion in All Countries Unanimously Praises It</p>
<p>[Moscow] The entire population of the Soviet Union is paying attention to the progress of Arctic explorers. People from all walks of life throughout the country are holding meetings to celebrate and sending congratulatory telegrams. (TASS dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to local reports, the Arctic explorers Shmidt, Vodopyanov, Papanin, and others sent a telegram of thanks to Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, and other party and government leaders, stating, "We are deeply gratified and honored to hear the congratulatory telegrams from the Party and the government. This is the glory of all the Soviet people, who have this amazing country, excellent aircraft, and unprecedented conditions for promoting scientific development and the progress of the people. You call the establishment of the Arctic station 'the culmination of a glorious period of work'. This is the period of Soviet exploration and overcoming the Arctic Ocean. This is the period when Comrade Stalin personally put forward the task of overcoming the North, personally formulated plans and methods, and personally continuously guided and cared for Arctic explorers. It is the most pleasant and honorable thing for us to realize your ideals in our own field of work and receive your praise." (TASS dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Three planes from Rudolph Island, loaded with food, took off in the snow, preparing to fly blindly to the Arctic. At 6:40 this morning, a radio message was received from the Arctic team stating that all three planes had safely reached their destination, less than fifteen miles from the North Pole. The first plane was piloted by Molokov, carrying seven people, including a reporter from Pravda. The second plane was piloted by Achinkevich, also carrying seven people, including a reporter from Izvestia. The third plane was piloted by Matchak, carrying six passengers. The three planes carried a total of nine tons of food and equipment. The flight from Rudolph Island to the North Pole took two hours. (Kuo Min dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] At 11:15 PM on May 25th, the remaining three planes of the Arctic expedition took off from Rudolph Island for the Arctic floating station, carrying important supplies for the station, such as scientific instruments, food, equipment, fuel, motorcycles, and tents. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] At 6:24 this morning, aviator Molokov safely landed at the "North Pole Station." The other two planes took off later, and were still circling in the air at 7:40. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The deputy leader of the expedition, Shevelev, who is currently on Rudolph Island, told a TASS reporter, "We will probably have to fly above the clouds to the North Pole. If that is the case, the pilots will only be able to use astronomical instruments and the radio beacon of Rudolph Island to determine direction. It would be best if the weather is clear when we approach the North Pole; otherwise, we will pass through the clouds and fly low around the Pole to find Vodopyanov's plane. If the weather turns bad when we approach the North Pole, we will choose a suitable location to land, and then try to communicate with Shmidt. Eventually, all four planes will converge at one location. After finding the best location to establish the polar station, everyone will assist Papanin's team in setting up the station. After that, we will return to Rudolph Island together." (TASS dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Aviator Golovin safely arrived at Rudolph Island on April 19th. The island is the northernmost island in the Soviet Arctic Ocean. Golovin flew across the Arctic Ocean for about 4,000 kilometers, from Moscow via Kolmogory, Naryan-Mar, Matochkin Strait, Cape Zhelaniya, and to the island. The flight time was 23 hours, and the entire journey took 29 days. Due to bad weather, he had to land in Kolmogory, Naryan-Mar, and Cape Zhelaniya. He was flying an ordinary twin-engine plane. Apart from a heating tank and a large oil stove for heating the engine, there was no special equipment for navigating the Arctic Ocean. Currently, Golovin is preparing to fly near the island. Rudolph Island was discovered in 1874 and is one of the northernmost territories of the Soviet Union. The island is located at 82 degrees north latitude, with an area of 220 square kilometers. The entire island is covered in ice all year round, with only a slightly thinner layer of ice on the coast. The central ice mountain is up to 300 meters high, and the flat areas are very suitable natural airfields. The island has an unusual climate. July is the warmest month, with temperatures rising to 0 degrees Celsius. November is the coldest, with temperatures mostly below minus 22 degrees Celsius. The coldest period was in 1932-33, reaching minus 36.5 degrees Celsius. The hottest period was in June 1933, reaching 6.7 degrees Celsius. In 1929, the expedition led by Shmidt established a geographical observation station in Tiksi Bay. In 1932, the world's northernmost meteorological station was established on the island. In 1936, the famous explorer Papanin established the world's northernmost winter camp there. Rudolph Island is very important because it is only 900 kilometers from the North Pole. The daily radio weather reports from the island to Moscow are extremely valuable. (TASS report)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Newspapers around the world continue to comment on the Soviet conquest of the Arctic. The British Manchester Guardian stated, "The Soviet Arctic exploration is not only about setting records, but also about increasing human knowledge. This exploration proves the strength of Soviet scientific progress. Soviet science has established the foundation for the great work of studying the Arctic." Finnish newspapers recorded the glorious victory of the Soviet Arctic Ocean explorers. The Social Democratic newspaper of Finland detailed the preparations for this exploration, as well as its equipment and supplies.

<h3>Britain Plans to Conclude Trade Agreements with Various Countries</h3>
<p>But Must Be Based on a Sound Foundation; Preferential Tariff System Not to Be Abandoned; British Trade Secretary Runciman States in the House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] Trade Secretary Runciman made a speech in the House of Commons today, declaring that trade negotiations between Britain and the United States are still in the preliminary stages, and that the current effort is to lay the foundation for negotiations. The British government is now awaiting the results of the Imperial Conference. Based on the resolutions of the conference, the British government will revise its commercial relations with various countries (including the United States). However, the British government has now decided to conclude a commercial treaty with the United States, and will do its best to achieve this, no matter how difficult. He continued that the Imperial Conference cannot abolish the preferential tariff system, but can only change the form of the current system. The conference is currently studying the world economic situation and will not ignore the fact that there can be many different ways of implementing the preferential tariff system. If tariffs are excessively focused on revenue collection, then this system is no different from madness. On the other hand, if no tariffs are collected at all, then neither England nor the Empire can survive. (Kuo Min Hai Tung dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Czech Founding Father Karel Kramář Passes Away Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Fought for National Independence; Renowned Like President Masaryk</p>
<p>⊙ Prague, Czech Republic Karel Kramář, one of the founding fathers of Czechoslovakia, passed away this morning at the age of seventy-seven. Kramář was born in a small town in the province of Bohemia. He studied in Prague at a young age, and later studied in France and Germany. After completing his studies, he was elected as a member of the Federal Parliament of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the European War, he led the Slavic nations to fight against the old Habsburg royal family, gaining great prestige, and was comparable to former President Masaryk. After the Great War, he participated in the Paris Peace Conference with Masaryk. In recent years, he has led various opposition parties to oppose former President Masaryk and current President Beneš, and represents the will of the Slavic nations in opposing Germany.

<h3>A Tour of the Political Exposition in Tokyo, Japan</h3>
<p>Full of Historical Materials of China's National Humiliation; Sixty Years of Tragic Deeds</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: The Tokyo Political Exposition is divided into eleven pavilions displaying valuable materials. The reporter recently visited it once, but the records at the time did not allow for detailed study. Now, after focusing on the materials related to China during my first visit, I will report what I learned below.</p>
<p>Constitution Pavilion</p>
<p>There are many heartbreaking materials related to our country displayed: ㊀ Minister Oshima, picture of negotiations between Qing and Korea, after the Sino-Japanese War, Russia, Germany, and France intervened. Ito, Kawayama, and Lt. Generals Kawakami explained the situation. ㊁ The intervention of the three countries, the original telegram from Minister Kurino Shinichiro stationed in the United States to Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu. ㊂ Pictures of the Sino-Japanese War, divided into ten pictures of Jiuliancheng, Weihaiwei, the Battle of Gyeongseong, Phoenix City, the Battle of Pyongyang, Minister Oshima's negotiations, the occupation of Asan, Jinzhou, Haiyang Island, and the Battle of Fengdao Sea, all of which are five-color paintings. ㊃ Picture of the fall of Weihaiwei. There is another eye-catching place hanging up, depicting the surrender of Ding Ruchang, admiral of the Beiyang Fleet. When Ding bowed deeply to the Japanese commander with both hands, the Japanese commander made a mocking gesture, and the guards held their guns to protect him, which made people furious. ㊄ Old map of Changhua City, Taiwan ㊅ Picture of the victory of the Russo-Japanese War in Lushunkou, China.</p>
<p>Diplomacy Pavilion</p>
<p>㊀ Photo of Li Hongzhang. ㊁ Photos of Li Hongzhang's bedroom and reception room. ㊂ Photos of the negotiation venue. ㊃ Poem and notes written by Minister Lidao, who handled matters in the seventh year of Meiji, when he returned to the imperial court after successfully negotiating and making peace with China. ㊄ Photos of the Boxer Rebellion. ㊅ Urgent book on the situation in East Asia after the Sino-Japanese War. ㊆ Book on Sino-Japanese friendship and its cause. ㊇ Agreement on Sino-Japanese friendship and its cause. ㊈ Records of Qing, Korean, and Japanese diplomatic incidents.</p>
<p>Army Pavilion</p>
<p>Items related to Sino-Japanese relations are displayed: ㊀ Sino-Japanese War, Prince Kan'in's military hat and military uniform pants, which are red, Qing dragon sword, military sword, Qing soldier company, spear. ㊁ Battle of Pyongyang, Qing soldiers' military uniforms, completely red clothes and trousers. On the back of the clothes, there is a cloth badge, which reads "Shandong Fubiao Ji Zi Right Battalion Sentinel Shed." There are black Ping Sheng three-level clothing edges on the chest. ㊂ Active model of the Battle of Niuzhuang. The Japanese army fired at the Qing army, and the Qing army resisted with broadswords, using electric lights to represent the sparks of guns and cannons. The explainer said that this projection was on March 4th of Meiji 28, when the Japanese army attacked Niuzhuang City and occupied it on the 5th. The Japanese army was the 3rd Division Commander Lieutenant General Katsura Taro and the 5th Division Commander Lieutenant General Oku Yasukata of the First Army. ㊃ Two "horizontal plaques" presented by Huo Liangshun, the acting capital officer of the Yulei Yingchang Xuechang Zhengzong Palace, and seven students, craftsmen, soldiers, etc., with the words "Cheers Resound". ㊄ Boxer Rebellion, model of the Japanese army attacking Beijing City. The explainer said that in May of Meiji 33, the Chinese Boxers rose up and the Allied Forces attacked Beijing. Under the command of Lieutenant General Yamaguchi Motoomi of the 5th Division of the Japanese Army, they were incorporated into the Allied Forces. This was the beginning of Japan's gaining the right to speak in the East Asian situation. After that, the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the increase of Russian troops in the three northeastern provinces caused the Russo-Japanese War in later years. ㊅ First general attack on Lushun Fortress, model of the Japanese army forcibly occupying Panlong Mountain. The Third Army under General Nogi captured the fortress in one day. Before the fall, the Japanese army attacked for six days and nights, suffering 15,800 casualties without any progress.

<h3>Japanese Consuls in North China Hold Meeting in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Led by Horiuchi to Study Concrete Opinions; Important Consultation Held Centered Around Morishima</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The meeting of Japanese consuls stationed in North China this time can be divided into two stages: the meeting held on the 21st and 22nd, which was centered on Consul General Horiuchi in Tianjin to discuss diplomatic issues; the meeting held on the 24th, which was centered on Morishima, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, to decide on specific plans. Therefore, the meeting on the 21st and 22nd can also be regarded as a preparatory meeting, and the results of the discussion were to provide consultations for the meeting on the 24th. Those who discussed on the 21st and 22nd were Consul General Horiuchi in Tianjin, Consuls Ogihara, Oe, Kishii, Vice Consuls Nishida, Tanaka, Fujita, Nagai, Consul General Arino stationed in Jinan, Consul General Otaka stationed in Qingdao, Consul Nakan rooted stationed in Zhangjiakou, Consul Fujii stationed in Shanhaiguan, etc. In addition, there were Beppu, an official of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched to inspect the situation in Qingdao, and Kato, Chargé d'Affaires of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The meeting opened at 3:00 PM on the 21st. Beppu conveyed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs's opinions on the Qingdao case and reported on his inspection of the situation with Consul General Otaka stationed in Qingdao. After discussion, the participants divided into three items: ㊀ □□ issues, ㊁ North China diplomatic issues, ㊂ Economic development issues for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM that day. At 9:00 AM on the 22nd, the meeting continued to discuss concrete opinions on the previous three matters and adjourned at noon. There was a rest on the 23rd. At 1:50 PM that day, Morishima Morihito, the newly appointed counselor of the Japanese Embassy in China, arrived in Tianjin by China Airlines flight after meeting with Kita in Shanghai to exchange views on the current situation. Japanese consuls all went to Dongjuzi Airport to welcome him, and then accompanied him to the official residence of the Japanese Consul General in the British Concession to rest. In the afternoon, Morishima and Kita freely exchanged views with the consuls in the official residence until late. Horiuchi hosted a banquet to entertain them. At 9:00 AM on the 24th, Morishima took the lead to convene a meeting with the consuls of North China at the official residence of the Consul General as the venue. There was a break at 1:30 PM. Then, they responded to the invitation of Commander Tashiro of the Japanese Garrison to a banquet, and exchanged views on the spot. The discussion continued at 3:00 PM and did not end until 5:30 PM. The Consuls General of Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan rested briefly after the meeting and then held a discussion meeting at the original location at around 6:00 PM, making important decisions. Otaka was responsible for handling them and returned to Qingdao on the 25th to handle them. Morishima scheduled to take an early train to Beijing on the 25th to transfer to Tongzhou for investigation, and then took a Huitong plane to Dalian to return to the country via this route to report.</p>
<p>It is found that the assembly of Japanese consuls in North China this time, and Morishima's coming, in the present-day mission is to instruct the Qingdao affair negotiation policy, in the future mission, on behalf of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to come and listen to the opinions of the consuls on the spot, for the specific aspects to be summarized and resolved, carrying them back to the country, for the recent Japanese Land, Foreign, and Finance Ministers' meeting to study the reference materials on the China policy, to facilitate Kawagoe's return to office, to re-introduce the factors of adjusting diplomacy. Therefore, this meeting is not to be taken lightly. (24th)</p>
<h3>A Prospective View of Zhejiang Province's Finances (Continued)</h3>
<p>Speaking of fisheries, our province has 996 kilometers of coastline. The annual output of fisheries once reached a record of 50 million, but it has plummeted recently and is unable to reach even 20 million. There are certainly many reasons for this. If we want to revive the fisheries, the first thing we must do is improve the current situation, reduce the burden on fishermen, and reduce the cost of production. This is the most important thing. On the one hand, we will implement the public sale of fish under supervision so that fishermen can truly benefit. On the other hand, we must gradually improve the organization of fishermen and provide fishermen's loans. After these preliminary tasks are completed, I think Zhejiang's fisheries will be able to barely compete with foreign products in the market. Then we will modernize it further, with cold storage facilities, new-style fishing boats, and so on, which can be implemented one after another. After I arrived in Zhejiang, I asked the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica to send a survey team to the coast to investigate aquatic products. They are currently working actively. At the same time, we are also planning to establish a marine biology research institute. Starting from this aspect, I think our province's fisheries definitely have great hope.</p>
<p>The remaining industrial and mining construction is also very important. Now, a mineral resources survey team has been jointly formed by the Institute of Geology of the Academia Sinica and the Construction Department of our province. Moreover, experts from the Ministry of Industry, Central University, and Zhejiang University have been invited to participate in conducting a systematic survey of the geology and mineral resources of our province. The first phase of the work is scheduled for one year. We are currently paying attention to the lead-zinc mines in Zhuji, the tin mines in Qingtian, the coal mines in Jiangshan, Qu County, and Changxing, the fluorite mines in 17 counties including Sheng County and Wuxing, and the antimony mines in Changhua. We will start with these few places to explore the tin mines. There is already a preliminary report, and it is hoped that the content will be more abundant than that of Fujian. We are now doing further exploration work, and it is expected that mining can begin soon. As for the other mines, we will proceed with them successively after the preliminary exploration work is substantially completed. As for the alum mines in Pingyang, which are world-famous for their production, large-scale industrial application methods are currently being studied by the Institute of Chemistry of the Academia Sinica for a long period. Up to now, they have obtained several methods in their research, which is to take the main part to crack aluminum and use the by-products to make fertilizer. This research has been substantially completed, but it is only a laboratory success. We are now also planning to build a cement plant and a glass factory near the Changxing coal mine. We know that the limestone used by the Shanghai Cement Plant is supplied by Changxing. Now that coal and stone are in the same place, and there are quartz mines nearby, it is, of course, more suitable for us to build a factory there.</p>
<p>The promotion of the sugar industry has also begun. Now we have rented 500 acres of tidal land in Pingyang and are going to Java, Xiamen, and other places to handle several improved varieties of sugar cane, first to do an experiment. By next spring, we will know the initial results. If it is good, then we can actively propagate sugar cane and then proceed to establish a new-style sugar refinery. Other things, such as the improvement of the paper-making industry, the improvement of the brewing industry, and the improvement and expansion of the tea industry, are also in our plans. Speaking of the seed improvement and promotion of general agriculture, it is best to have a large number of seeds prepared first. Because our past rice seed improvement has only reached 200,000 mu of propagation this year, and wheat seed only has 50,000 mu, the number is too small. So this year, we are preparing a large number of seeds, preparing for a larger promotion next year. Plant diseases and insect pests are very important issues. Our province has paid considerable attention to insects in the past, so we have restored the Insect Bureau this year.</p>
<p>Our province's scenic spots and historical sites have always been famous tourist areas throughout the country. There are still many places suitable for recuperation and tourism that need to be developed. Therefore, the importance of developing the tourism industry in our province is at least no less than silk and seafood, as long as we use it appropriately.</p>
<p>In short, production and construction are a myriad of things. Today, I am just briefly talking about the projects that are already planned, and there is no mention of any plans, because if we want the economy of our province to truly improve, we must first have various construction projects as a foundation, and at the same time, there must be various construction projects to promote it. We must first have a financial foundation. Now that the finances are not on the right track, production and construction are really out of the question. Next year's economic construction can only be regarded as a preparation work. At least one or two years later, a procedural and long-term economic construction plan can be put forward.</p>
<p>From now on, the finances of our province, as I said above, will actively streamline and tighten on the one hand and try to open up sources of income on the other hand, not only in the negative aspects, such as the reorganization of financial administration and the rectification of tax revenue, but also in the positive aspects, that is, to work hard on production construction and cultivate tax sources. At present, our province's finances are the most heavily indebted province compared with other provinces, and it seems that we have reached the end of our rope. However, we have 21 million people and an area of 101,300 square li, and we also have a cultural foundation. If the people of our province, both inside and outside the province, can be mobilized to work together for their hometown, use cooperative methods, take science as the foundation, and do it practically and in a modern way, there is definitely a lot of hope.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Brother Kills Wheat Harvester in Dispute</p>
<p>Xia Gengsheng, a farmer from Xicang Stone Township, Xin Zhuang Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, went to harvest wheat with his sworn brother, Shu Geng, on the afternoon of the 25th and loaded it onto a boat to return to the Zhujing Ham, Xizhu Jing Township. Shu Geng wanted to load the wheat back to his home, but Gengsheng refused, so they started arguing. Then they wrestled on the boat, and Shugeng was pushed into the water and drowned. Seeing that he had caused a disaster, Gengsheng surrendered himself to the local procuratorate on the 26th. Prosecutor Wu sent personnel to the countryside to investigate and interrogate, and Gengsheng was taken into custody.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Scheduled for Oath</p>
<p>Cao Boquan, the magistrate of this county, has been transferred to Songjiang for more than a month. It is now scheduled that on June 1, he and Song Mingqi, the chief of the county police bureau, will simultaneously take the supplementary oath in the county government auditorium.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Embezzlement of Public Funds Case Concluded</p>
<p>Jin Mingshu, the head of the tooth tax collection office in this county, was accused by Wu Xiangfeng, a collector in the office, of embezzling and obstructing his reputation. After repeated inquiries by the county government, it was confirmed that Jin had indeed embezzled a portion of the education and construction surtax from July to October of the 25th year. A verdict has already been announced, and the main text reads: Jin Mingshu, with the intention of illegally owning it, embezzled items held in his business capacity and was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 300 yuan. If he is unable to pay, two yuan will be deducted for one day of labor. The remaining portion is not guilty.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Commemorative Xia Zhen Entertainment Fair</p>
<p>The entertainment fair commemorating General Xia Zhen's meritorious deeds in resisting the enemy was held on the afternoon of the 25th, starting at 2 pm. The parade route covered the entire city, and the crowd of spectators was huge, blocking the road. All kinds of decorations, such as floats and stilt walkers, were available until late at night. Electric lights illuminated the scene like daytime, and the scene was lively and enthusiastic. Restaurants and wine shops were all three times more profitable.</p>
<p>Inspecting County's Militia Team</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Military Training Association, in order to assess the training performance of the militia in various counties, specially dispatched Secretaries Cheng Tai'a and Gu Zhensheng to Kunshan on the morning of the 24th to inspect the militia team in the urban area at the public stadium. Secretary Gu also convened the instructors to give a speech, with many words of encouragement. Starting on the 25th, they went to various townships to continue the inspection.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Military Supplies Discovered in Empty Coffin</p>
<p>A large number of military supplies were found in an empty coffin in the Yue Wang Temple in Dong Tang City, the eighth district, (on the 25th), including two rifles, three Mauser pistols, a wooden box of bullets totaling about 5,000 rounds, and seven sets of gray cloth military uniforms. It is reported that the empty coffin is the coffin of Zhou Sanbao, the owner of the De Tai Fish Market in the town. It has been made for many years and kept in the temple. Now that it is dry, craftsmen have been hired to paint it. When the lid was opened, the above-mentioned military supplies were discovered. They were immediately reported to the local security group for removal. However, these guns were lost by the town's security group four years ago. Now that they have been found, the condition of the items suggests that they have been frequently used. Therefore, it is suspected that the recent robberies in various townships are related to these guns. It is said that the number lost by the group was not limited to this, so the search continues in various empty coffins.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Provincial Committee Investigates Coal Mine</p>
<p>The Chengjin Coal Mine Company in Dongting West Mountain had its mining license revoked by the Ministry of Industry at the request of the Limin Coal Mine Company, which was issued a new Limin license. Therefore, Luo Ganchang, the manager of Chengjin, has twice petitioned the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to revoke the new Limin license and continue the validity of the old license. The creditors of the Chengjin Coal Mine believe that it hinders their rights and have decided to issue a declaration asking all sectors to uphold justice. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is paying close attention to the coal mine dispute in the mountain and has specially dispatched Provincial Committee Member Ye Xiufeng to the mountain to conduct an on-site inspection for verification.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Tear Down City Walls and Widen Streets on Schedule</p>
<p>The Municipal Construction Committee has decided to widen Fengguangqiao Street inside the Lianrong Bridge, a vacant area of the north gate, and the new Qianxian Street, and to demolish the Yuecheng at the north gate. Construction is scheduled to begin on June 20. However, the shops in the area are extremely panicked and have jointly petitioned the Construction Bureau to postpone the demolition, but to no avail. It was learned yesterday that the Construction Bureau believes that this project should not be delayed, so it has issued a notice requiring all shops to relocate before June 20 and all owners to voluntarily demolish before June 30. The guard post inside Yuecheng and the Kongjiang Tea House on the city tower have also been notified to relocate as soon as possible. The width of the road will still proceed according to eight meters.</p>
<p>Universally Install Alarm Bells</p>
<p>The County Police Bureau has recently noticed frequent robberies in the area. In order to prevent them, it has formulated guidelines for the prevention of bandits for the people of townships, stipulating that merchants and residents must universally install alarm bells. If a family is robbed, they should immediately press the bell to notify the neighbors on the left, right, front, and back, and successively raise the alarm, so that the people of the entire town and village will know in an instant and concentrate their efforts to apprehend the bandits, so that the area can live and work in peace.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Tide at Dingbo Claims Two Lives</p>
<p>The tide at Dingbo Gate, north of the city, is very rapid.

<h3>Daishan</h3>
<p>Daishan Salt Field Upgraded</p>
<p>It is found that the salt production in Zhejiang Province is the best in the Yu and Dai fields. The Yu field was originally ranked as first-class, and the Dai field was second. Since the Dai field tragedy last year, everything has been waiting to be rebuilt. Zhu Xufan, who was transferred from the former Salt Affairs Audit Office, has achieved considerable results since he took over the reorganization. Now, during the reorganization period, the Salt Affairs Bureau has decided to transfer the Dinghai and Qingquan fields to the jurisdiction of the Daishan field, raising the rank of the Daishan field. Zhu Xufan will continue to serve as the agent to utilize his expertise. It is reported that after receiving the order, Field Director Zhu immediately ordered each field to convene a meeting to manage and handle the jurisdiction in order to facilitate public affairs.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>General MacArthur Discusses Philippine Island Defense Plan</h3>
<p>A Word in Shanghai on Tuesday: Sovereignty Cannot Be Shared</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that General MacArthur, Special Representative of the U.S. Department of War, accompanied by his wife, passed through Shanghai on the Coolidge President on Tuesday, heading to Manila. It is said that Mr. MacArthur was ordered to the Philippines two years ago to assist the Philippine government in drafting a defense plan for the Philippine Islands and to reorganize the Philippine Army. In February of this year, he accompanied Philippine President Quezon to Washington to discuss economic and political issues concerning the Philippine Islands. After arriving in Shanghai, he spoke with guests about the defense of the Philippine Islands, saying that the current defense procedures in the Philippines are only for defense and should not be interpreted otherwise. When asked if the Philippine Islands are in danger of being attacked, Mr. MacArthur replied that although there are various rumors, he is very skeptical of any country in the Pacific with malicious intentions toward the Philippines. He believes that such rumors are only believed by those with selfish motives. The Philippine Islands are a democratic country, so they implement a democratic foreign policy and are determined not to participate in any disturbances and are determined to keep disturbances away from the Philippine Islands. The status of the Philippine Islands is the same as that of Switzerland. Switzerland has not participated in wars for more than a hundred years, but Switzerland still maintains a large military force to prevent any unexpected events. The Philippine Islands are also the same. And the self-defense of the Philippine Islands is a stable factor in the Pacific. Since we cannot recognize that Switzerland has the intention of invading neighboring countries, others cannot point out that the Philippine Islands' military deployment has the intention of invading. When asked if Quezon's trip was successful, Mr. MacArthur replied that this trip was for explanation purposes. From a global perspective, the United States and the Philippine Islands sympathize with each other and try to find a permanent solution to the problem so that both sides can benefit. Mr. MacArthur then talked about US-Philippine trade, saying that the biggest obstacle at present is the issue of sovereignty. Sovereignty is like a wife and cannot be shared by two people. Senator Buengamino of the Philippines, who returned to the Philippines from the United States on the Coolidge President, believes that Quezon's trip will definitely be successful and that the United States will allow the Philippine Islands to be independent before 1940. President Quezon, accompanied by his wife and three children, went from Washington to Paris and has now returned to the United States. Quezon may take the Hoover President or the next Coolidge President, passing through Shanghai to return to the Philippines. His wife plans to stay in the United States temporarily, as her three children will study at a school near Washington.</p>
<h3>The Arrival of the Second Eurasia Aircraft in Shanghai</h3>
<p>No News from Long-Wave Radio Yet; Preparing to Welcome on the Way</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation ordered two JU5.2 three-engine large aircraft from the German Junkers Aircraft Factory. The first aircraft was flown to China last month, and the second was flown by German pilot Han Lusi on the morning of the 19th of this month, taking off from Berlin, passing through Athens, Yaoda, Karachi, Calcutta, Yangon, Bangkok, Hanoi, and Hong Kong to China. According to the company's news, although the aircraft has radio equipment, it is long-wave, so it cannot communicate directly until it reaches Hong Kong. Since the aircraft departed from Berlin, no telegram has been sent, so as of last night, the exact time of its arrival in Shanghai was still unknown. However, it must be very safe on the way. The company is now preparing to welcome it, and the accompanying personnel include mechanic Keliz, radio operator Sipu Duwei, and engineer Feiqu.</p>

<h3>Gauze Sales Are Brisk, but Yarn Stocks Are Greatly Reduced and Prices Are Skyrocketing</h3>
<p>Factories Are Rushing to Spin and Temporarily Suspending the Sale of Futures; Workers' Skills Have Been Exhaustively Improved</p>
<p>Since the national agricultural harvest and the gradual recovery of the countryside, gauze has been selling well due to increased purchasing power. Although Chinese and foreign yarn factories are working day and night to spin, they are always unable to meet the demand, and yarn prices are skyrocketing and yarn stocks are greatly increased, totaling about 30,000 bales. Various yarn factories have suspended the sale of futures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Stocks Are Greatly Reduced and Prices Are Skyrocketing</p>
<p>After the brisk sales of gauze, the factories that had been shut down have successively started operations by means of leasing, reorganization, resumption of business, and entrusted management. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are 31 Chinese merchants, 4 British merchants, and 30 Japanese merchants, all of which are working day and night to spin. Due to the brisk sales of gauze, the yarn spun by various factories is not enough to supply the buyers, and the market has tended to be in short supply. Yarn prices are skyrocketing. The standard yarn price of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Exchange for May has risen to 281 yuan per bale in national currency. Yarn stocks have been greatly reduced. Taking Shanghai as an example, the total is less than 30,000 bales.</p>
<p>Factories Are Temporarily Suspending the Sale of Futures</p>
<p>The largest yarn stock in Shanghai was as high as 150,000 bales. The current stock is less than 30,000 bales. Most of these 30,000 bales of yarn are stored in the godowns of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Exchange. As for the Chinese and foreign yarn factories, the weaving factories and users in various places are in great need, and the flowers spun are not enough to be distributed, so they have had to temporarily suspend the sale of futures. There is no yarn in the godowns of various factories. As for the sales of cotton, although they are selling well along with yarn, because of the national cotton harvest last year, the price has not risen as much as cotton yarn. The exchange price for May is 48 yuan per dan in national currency.</p>
<p>Yarn Factories Improve Workers' Skills</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign yarn factories are gradually finding ways to improve workers' skills, which is of great importance to reducing costs. Taking the average ability of each worker in Chinese factories to manage spindles as an index of 100 in 1933, it was 132.81 in 1934, 146.87 in 1935, and 155.71 in 1936. Foreign yarn factories in China have been working hard to improve workers' skills. However, workers' wages have also gradually increased, such as voluntarily increasing workers' wages and improving workers' treatment. Chinese yarn factories have also recently voluntarily increased workers' wages.</p>

<h3>Juxingcheng Bank's Handling of Sichuan Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Letter Reply to Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the 1 million yuan of public bonds previously allocated by the Central Government to relieve the Sichuan disaster, the Ministry of Finance stated that the funds were delayed in being remitted to Sichuan. According to a telegram from prominent Sichuan gentry, personnel had been dispatched to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the delay. The Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai also inquired with Juxingcheng Bank because the funds were handled by the bank. The bank sent a letter to the association yesterday explaining the sales process. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs,</p>
<p>We have read in the newspaper that your association proposed in the second item that Juxingcheng Bank should be requested to provide a detailed reply to this association regarding when the 1 million yuan of relief bonds were remitted and where they were remitted, in order to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>We hereby present the circumstances of our bank's entrusted sale of public bonds and remittance of funds as follows:</p>
<p>The drought in Sichuan is severe, and victims are everywhere. Previously, the Ministry of Finance allocated 1 million yuan of E-type unified public bonds to Chairman Zhu of the Relief Committee to sell and bring the funds into Sichuan for emergency relief. At that time, fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai were running around and calling out. Manager Wang Nanzhi of our bank also participated in the appeal. He was instructed by Chairman Zhu to assist in the sale of the bonds. Personnel dispatched by the Relief Committee delivered the aforementioned 1 million yuan of public bonds to us on April 15th and 16th. They were subsequently sold on the stock exchange at market prices. The total price received was 714,362.42 yuan.</p>
<p>Public bonds must be settled and received on the 29th of the month. Manager Wang Nanzhi of our bank believed that the Sichuan disaster was serious, the victims were starving, and the public was uneasy. Disaster relief could not be delayed. He negotiated with Chairman Zhu to fly to Sichuan as soon as possible to comfort the victims. He also agreed with Chairman Zhu that if the aforementioned relief funds were urgently needed before the public bonds were settled on April 29th, Manager Wang Nanzhi of our bank was willing to be responsible for negotiating with the financial community in Chongqing to advance the funds in full. He also negotiated with Director Liu Hangchen to send a telegram to the Chongqing Banking Association to prepare funds for support in order to avoid discounting and consuming more funds.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chairman Zhu decided to fly to Sichuan on April 19th with Commissioner Cao sent by the Ministry. However, because the procedures for surveying the disaster in Sichuan were not completed, the funds prepared by the financial community in Chongqing were never withdrawn.</p>
<p>Subsequently, on April 29th, the public bonds were settled. That morning, personnel from the Accounting Committee came to our bank and transferred the full amount of 714,000 yuan to the Bank of Communications to be remitted to the Central Bank of China in Nanjing. Our bank's entrusted sales procedures were then completed. As for how the funds were subsequently disbursed and remitted to Sichuan, it was entirely the responsibility of the Relief Committee, and our bank was not involved.</p>
<p>We are honored by your association's attention and hereby present the circumstances as described above for your reference.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Juxingcheng Bank, Shanghai</p>
<p>To the Sichuan Fellow Association in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Gansu Province</h3>
<p>Relief Association Reports by Letter; 20,000 Yuan Will Be Remitted to Lanzhou Today</p>
<p>The Joint Charity Relief Association of Shanghai received a letter from the Relief Committee yesterday reporting on the disaster situation in various counties of Gansu Province. The counties that suffered the most severe natural disasters included Jiuquan, Wuwei, and 13 other counties. The counties that suffered the next most severe natural disasters included Gaolan, Lintao, and 26 other counties. The counties that suffered relatively light natural disasters included Xiahe, Jingtai, and 11 other counties. The counties that suffered the most severe bandit disasters included Huanxian, Zhenning, and 31 other counties. The counties that suffered the next most severe bandit disasters included Huixian, Liangdang, and 11 other counties. The counties that suffered relatively light bandit disasters included Tianshui, Xihe, and 9 other counties. A total of 39 counties suffered both bandit disasters and natural disasters, including Qingyang, Zhenning, Zhenyuan, Guyuan, Minxian, Weiyuan, Tongwei, and Longxi.</p>
<p>Gansu Province has always been known for its poverty. Now, it has suffered such a catastrophe. The dying disaster victims cannot seek death or find life. The people of Gansu Province rely entirely on farming and animal husbandry. Since the natural disasters and bandit disasters, the grain and livestock stored in each county have been plundered. Not only is the livelihood of the people currently hopeless, but also the spring plowing this year has completely failed to sow seeds. The land is red for thousands of miles, and the starving are everywhere. If a remedy is not planned in advance, the disaster survivors will have no hope. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will be hungry for themselves and drown their own feelings, and donate enthusiastically so that they can be remitted to the scattered shocks. The life and death of flesh and blood are immeasurable.</p>
<p>The Joint Charity Relief Association of Shanghai yesterday telegraphed Zhu Qinglan of the Relief Committee, "The Provincial Government of Xi'an left to transfer to the Relief Committee. The Commissioner Zhu Qinglan's Xunjian, Jingdian is fully aware of the tragedy of Gan Zai, which is very deep. The association allocates 20,000 yuan for relief. It will be remitted to the Beijing Relief Committee on the same day and transferred to Lanzhou for release. A special reply, the Shanghai Charity Relief Association kowtows."</p>

<h3>Haiyuan Escapes Danger Today</h3>
<p>After the Haiyuan ship of the China Merchants Bureau spent several days filling the hole and throwing away the cargo in the cabin, and using four large pumps to pump water, the ship was scheduled to float out of the reef yesterday and be towed to Hong Kong for repairs. However, yesterday afternoon, the bureau received a telegram from the rescuers of the Haiyuan ship, saying that the holes in the two cabins have been repaired, but there are still some nail holes on the iron plate that have not been filled. Therefore, it will be delayed for another day of work, and it will be possible to repair all of them today and drag them to Hong Kong. The Taikoo Shipyard will carry out major repairs. It is reported that this accident of the Haiyuan ship, all the damage repairs, and the loss of the ship's schedule, etc., will reach more than 100,000 yuan, and the number of flooded cargo pieces thrown into the sea in the ship has not yet been calculated in detail, but the total amount is feared to exceed 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs Maritime Patrol and Engineering Department issued an emergency maritime warning bulletin yesterday, stating that it had received a report from Jianghanguan that the Dongliu light boat in the Jiujiang section of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River suddenly left its original position. The Yangtze River ship is of great importance, because the upstream and downstream wheels use this light boat as the standard for navigation. Once it is changed, it is deeply worried that the ships will not know the reason and cause the disaster of being grounded and hitting shallowly, so they fly to inform all Jianglun to pay attention, and at the same time, they urgently find a way to find the light boat and move it to its original position to ensure navigation safety.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai Silk Industry Petitioned in Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>The import tax rates of man-made silk and its woven products are vastly different from those of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai Silk Weaving Federation. The differences are unbalanced, so that foreign silk cloths can be sold in large quantities in the domestic market, affecting domestic silk merchants.

According to a reporter from Dagongshe, the central government is also very concerned about the revision of this tax law, but the matter involves diplomatic issues. My country has been weak for a long time and has been subjected to all kinds of unreasonable constraints from foreign countries, which is not limited to this one. The process is more tortuous, and in the future, I hope that the people of the whole country will work hard to love themselves and cultivate national strength, so that any constraints can be destroyed.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Hospital to Cancel the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Tax</h3>
<p>Foreign rice is tax-free, let alone domestic agricultural products, named "Teqi" and should be cancelled as soon as possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed yesterday to request the abolition of the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax. Nanjing Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Finance•Guangdong Provincial Government Xunjian, on the 25th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, the letter from the Shanghai Guangdong Miscellaneous Grain Association opened that the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax has a unique name and far-reaching toxins. In the past, the warlords held power and recognized the peanut oil, bean grains and other items transported from various provinces to Guangdong as imported goods for the Hong Kong population, and violently added emblems, which caused merchants and farmers to be in trouble. Please exempt them from the exemption. The Ministry of Finance issued a number of 10413 replies, and the Electricity Department was fully aware of the situation in Guangdong. The Guangdong Bureau was pacified, the state affairs were renewed, and the Ministry of Finance had ordered Song Jian, the Director of Finance, to abolish the unfair donations and taxes that had been presented to the Ministry. According to the above information, it is up to the overall management to handle it. This batch of and other reasons, the illegality of the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax, as early as the authorities' Dong Jian, during the winter last year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance had reduced the special tax by 20%, which is the authorities' intention to abolish the illegal Agricultural Special Tax. For all to see, the merchants could only endure the pain and wait for the grace because the financial situation of Guangdong Province was not sufficient at that time. After the business tax in Guangdong Province was reorganized this year, it has increased several times, and the income tax has been organized in accordance with the central government's order. The treasury has been more affluent than in the past. The people of Guangdong have enthusiastically paid the legal taxes of the country and the local governments, and the taxes that Guangdong Province has conducted illegally are still tolerated by the government and are not abolished. The people of Guangdong have always been subordinate to the central government, so they should not be treated differently. Moreover, it was found that the Guangdong Financial Department reduced the special tax by 10% in the winter last year. At the same time, the Guangdong currency continued to fall by more than 20%. The pain caused by the special tax to the people of Guangdong was never reduced in the slightest. It has been delayed until now, and it is really impatient. Recently, foreign rice is allowed to be exempted from tax, but agricultural products from all provinces need special taxes when transported to Guangdong. There is even more incomprehension in terms of reasoning. For this reason, I have been told that the situation is special, and I would like to write a special letter to the municipal chamber of commerce and submit it to the central hospitals, ordering Guangdong Province to immediately abolish the agricultural special tax on the same day, so as to relieve the merchants and the suffering of the people. Based on this investigation, this case has been reported to the members by the association in the past, and please submit it to the hospital for instructions to abolish it. It is only because the Guangdong government has not been unified that it has been delayed. Now that the government orders are consistent, how can this evil government that hurts farmers and businesses be allowed to exist again? To show its uniqueness, the permission is hereby given, and the situation is urgent. For the special transfer to your association, restate the previous situation, and promptly submit a reclamation hospital to strictly order the Guangdong Province to abolish the agricultural special tax on a certain day, so as to relieve the suffering of the people. It is found that the Guangdong Province has collected the agricultural special tax, and the festival has been reported to the association for cancellation according to the situation. In the past, it was read in the newspaper that the central government has always advocated the abolition of taxes and miscellaneous taxes in various provinces and cities. The Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax is the worst of the excessive taxes and hinders the transportation and sale of agricultural products from various provinces. Foreign rice and grains are exempted from taxation, and only the illegal agricultural special tax is still collected. How can it be said to be flat? It is reasonable to inform the hospital and the ministry of your situation, and quickly ask your hospital to issue an order and ask the Guangdong Province to abolish the agricultural special tax by order, so as to conform to the tax system, and to relieve the suffering of the people with no end. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows with seal.</p>

<h3>Kneeling to Propose Marriage with a Sincere Attitude, but After the Marriage Was Agreed Upon, He Enticed and Abandoned Her</h3>
<p>The Butcher Shop Owner is Too Dishonest; The Matchmaker Shares the Taste of Iron Bars</p>
<p>Hu Yu, a housewife from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, is 38 years old. Her husband is deceased. She has a daughter named Caizhen, who is 18 years old. She has a beautiful appearance and graceful demeanor. She studied dancing and graduated, but did not work as a dance hostess. She is now studying performing arts in theater. In the summer of last year, she was introduced by Gao Zigang (32 years old), a fellow villager of her father, to Jiang Weiyu (28 years old), a butcher shop owner from Pudong who currently lives at No. 51, Jianyeli, Fuli Road, French Concession. Jiang saw that the girl was beautiful and thought she was a fairy. His legal wife had just divorced, and he was looking for a suitable permanent companion. So, in early July last year, he entrusted Gao Zigang as a matchmaker to propose marriage to the Hu family. At first, Hu Yu and her daughter Hu Caizhen refused to agree because Jiang's age was too far apart from the girl's. Jiang intended to go to the girl's home in person with the matchmaker to kneel and propose marriage. Hu Yu and Hu Caizhen saw that Jiang was sincerely proposing marriage and, according to the matchmaker, Jiang had property and could be expected to live a comfortable life in the future. Therefore, the Hu and Jiang families agreed to the marriage in person, and it was agreed that a betrothal gift and jewelry would be required for the engagement. It was scheduled for both parties to get engaged at the Dagali Restaurant on July 21 last year, and Jiang entrusted Gao Zigang, the matchmaker, with 40 guest tickets from the Dagali Restaurant to be sent to the girl's home for the girl's family to invite relatives and friends to attend. Hu Yu was overjoyed that her daughter's lifelong happiness was entrusted to her and was preparing for the wedding. Who knew that Jiang Weiyu's actions were all false pretenses? Seeing that the girl's family had agreed to the engagement and the goal had been achieved, he enticed Hu Caizhen to go to the Yangzi Hotel on the nights of July 18 and 19 to open a room and have illicit relations for two nights. After that, he put the marriage out of his mind and did not ask or hear about it. When the date of the daughter's engagement arrived, Jiang did not take any action, and Hu Yu learned that her daughter had been enticed and defiled. She was shocked and immediately found the original matchmaker, Gao Zigang, to reason with him. Gao also procrastinated and avoided seeing her. Hu Yu then accompanied her daughter Hu Caizhen to retain lawyers Yang Xunqiu and Zhang, and filed a complaint with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Jiang Weiyu and Gao Zigang of seduction. After investigation by the prosecutor, they filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Land Court on charges of obstructing morals. The plaintiff also filed an incidental civil suit, seeking compensation for losses such as consolation money of 10,000 yuan. The Land Court opened a trial at one time, but the trial was suspended because Jiang and others refused to appear in court. A warrant was issued to arrest the defendant in the case. Until now, Hu Haitang, the younger brother of Hu Yu's husband, that is, the uncle of Hu Caizhen, learned of the whereabouts of the original matchmaker Gao Zigang. Only after finding Gao did he learn of Jiang's address. The two went to wait at the entrance of Jianyeli, Fuli Road at 10 am on the 25th. Seeing Jiang leaving the alley, they shouted and arrested him and took him to the French Concession Police Station and reported the previous situation. The police sent detectives to investigate and found it to be true. The detective head detained Jiang and Gao. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Second Court. After Judge Liao Yan interrogated them, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi clarified the case. According to the plaintiff Hu's mother and daughter's report on the course of seduction and defilement, Jiang admitted to seduction in court. The court ordered the defendants to be detained and await the Shanghai Local Court to come and pick them up for interrogation. It is heard that Jiang originally planned to marry Hu, but he declared bankruptcy and was under economic pressure and unable to maintain the marriage. His divorced wife held huge assets in her hands. After being persuaded by someone, Jiang abandoned his previous resentment with his divorced wife and reconciled, reuniting and living together at No. 51, Jianyeli, Fuli Road, and put aside the marriage with the Hu family. But it is difficult to escape the sanctions of the law. The two nights of romance are like clouds and smoke, and now they are suffering the taste of iron bars.</p>
<h3>Unclear Lawsuit Over Partnership to Open a Store</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Zhao Yin-xuan and Wen Gan-gao returned to Shanghai from Holland. They bought groceries at the Xiehe Tea Food Store on Bansongyuan Road and became acquainted with the store owner Li Zhenji. Li immediately persuaded them to invest, so they partnered to open the Daoxiangcun Tea Food Store at No. 2 Waitan, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Li was the manager. Not long after, a disagreement arose with Li due to accounting issues. Zhang Genyuan, a salesman from Guanshengyuan, learned of the situation and instructed Peng Chungeng, a staff member of the store, to discuss with Zhao to drive Li away. Zhang joined the company with a capital of 400 yuan. Zhao was appointed as honorary manager, and Zhang was appointed as manager. After only three months, the store was in a chaotic and irreparable state. Zhang then filed a complaint with the police station and had Zhao and his brother Zhao Hui'an and eleven store employees arrested and brought to court. It was found that there was 3 yuan and 50 cents of unaccounted funds, and Zhao was sentenced to six months in prison, while the others were acquitted. An appeal is in progress. However, the store owed rent and was provisionally seized by the landlord. Recently, Zhang reached a settlement with the landlord and the store was unsealed. Zhao Hui'an immediately went to the store to raise objections, but there was no result. He then went to the Land Court to press the alarm bell to complain about his grievances, but was instructed to request preservation of property from the Civil Court. The procedure was not compliant, and there was no result. Zhao Hui'an then filed a false accusation lawsuit, and the litigation continues endlessly, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tram Fares in the Two Concessions Will Be Readjusted</h3>
<p>Changing Copper Coins to New Subsidiary Currency, Effective June 1st</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency system policy in our country, the bus fares in the Public Concession of this city have been uniformly changed from copper coins to the new subsidiary currency. It is learned that the tramcars, both tracked and trackless, in the Public Concession will also uniformly change to the new subsidiary currency to readjust the price list from June 1st. Those that previously used copper coins as the unit will be changed to one cent of subsidiary currency as the unit. The readjustment method is roughly the same as that of the buses. The tram company issued a notice saying, "Starting from Tuesday, June 1, 1937, all current old copper coin fares for all tracked and trackless trams in the Public Concession will be converted to the new subsidiary currency. The new fares will be posted in the tracked and trackless trams starting from June 1, 1937. Secretary Acting Manager Prock."</p>
<p>In addition, the tram company of the French Concession has been calculating the prices of its tracked and trackless trams in copper coins, which has been quite inconvenient. Now, in order to vigorously implement the new currency system, it has been decided to readjust the fares from June 1st, uniformly calculated in the new subsidiary currency.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhenming, Who Forged Chiang Kai-shek's Seal, Appeals</h3>
<p>Intending to seek mass welfare, the appellant requests the original judgment to be revoked</p>
<p>Wu Zhenming, a 14-year-old student from Yancheng, Jiangsu, studying in the third grade of the Jiangwan Law School, forged Chiang Kai-shek's name card and seal to pay his respects to Acting Mayor Yu, intending to show off his own writings. He was discovered, arrested, and brought to the local court. He was sentenced to three months' imprisonment by Judge Wu of the Criminal Court for the crime of forging documents. Wu Zhenming did not accept the original judgment and retained lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file an appeal with the Jiangsu Higher Court. In his appeal statement, he quoted classics and discussed legal principles, saying that the establishment of crimes of using forged private documents and forging seals in criminal law requires that they be sufficient to harm the public or others. Conversely, even if there is such behavior, if it benefits the public or others, the crime is not established. The appellant, with the one gain of a fool, has written "A Review of Improving Chinese Coffins" and "An Outline of Improving Police Administration". He wanted to present these ideas, but because his words were too light and there was no way to advance, and the lower situation was difficult to convey to the higher levels, in a state of boredom, he tried the law by forging Chiang Kai-shek's name card and seal, hoping to avoid the obstacles of the doormen and directly reach the important position, so that he could gain a place of respect and raise his eyebrows. If he could present the two improvements to the emperor one day, the society and the people might receive his benefits. The appellant, as a student with a clean body, had no selfish intentions or intention to harm the public or others. The court accused him of forging documents and other crimes, which is like Jia Yi's "Security Policy", and his body is suffering extreme unease. If he had known this, he should have hidden them in famous mountains to be passed down to future generations. Why take humiliation? In short, the appellant's behavior has no malice, only the behavior of using forged private documents and seals, which did not harm the public or Chiang Kai-shek's personal interests, and was intended to seek welfare for the masses. There is no establishment requirement for Article 210 and Article 217, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, so please revoke the original judgment and declare him innocent, and so on.</p>
<h3>Young Schneider Paralyzed and Speeding to America</h3>
<p>Medical Equipment Along the Way, the Father Spared No Expense</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the American youth Schneider was traveling the world last year when he arrived in Shanghai and suddenly became paralyzed, unable to breathe. He relied on a type of artificial respirator called an iron lung at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital to preserve his life. Mr. Schneider has been treated in the hospital for many months, but he still cannot be separated from the iron lung for a moment. He now plans to return to the United States on the President Coolidge on June 6 to continue treatment. The ship is currently passing through Shanghai on its way to Manila and will specially build a room in the ship for Mr. Schneider when it returns from that port via Hong Kong. When he comes to Shanghai from Beijing, a baggage car of the Blue Steel Train will be converted into a hospital car, which will be equipped with a small generator to power the iron lung. The car used to board the ship from the train will also be equipped with a generator. Mr. Murphy, an employee of Mr. Schneider's father, has come to Shanghai from Beijing to make arrangements. Mr. Murphy plans to return to Beijing in the next day or two to make final arrangements with Mr. Schneider's father for his journey from Beijing to Shanghai. There will be a total of 20 people, including Mr. Schneider's doctors and nurses, on the President Coolidge. Mr. Schneider's father is an American millionaire, so he spares no expense to ensure his son's safety.</p>
<h3>A Dance Hostess Commits Suicide by Poisoning Due to Obstacles in Love</h3>
<p>A College Student Cannot Afford the Bride Price; The Girl's Father Blames Yu Aijuan</p>
<p>Yao Aixiang, a Jia Ding girl residing at No. 234, Han Yanli Road, is only sixteen years old. She has been working as a dance hostess at the Da Hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, she developed a relationship with Ruan Chengji, a student at Great China University, because of dancing. When her father, Yao Chenying, learned about it, he planned to marry his daughter to Ruan, but Ruan had to pay a considerable bride price. However, Ruan is a student and has no ability to produce the funds, which resulted in the love of two people being obstructed and unable to grow old together. Recently, Yao also has not been working at Da Hu for two months because of this. Suddenly, at 11 PM on the 24th of this month, Yao Aixiang secretly swallowed poison. At that time, her family did not know anything. It was not until noon the next day that it was discovered. She was rushed to the Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital for treatment, but because she was deeply poisoned, the treatment was ineffective. She died at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday. The Hongkou Police Station received a report and immediately ordered detectives to transport the body to the autopsy room on Ferron Road. After investigation, the detectives obtained two suicide notes from Yao, one to her parents and one to her fellow dance hostess Yu Aijuan, accusing her of being unfeeling and unjust. Yesterday, Song Gensen, the prosecutor of the Special First Court, came to the autopsy room. After examining the body, he ascended to the public office. According to the investigation report from the police station, the deceased committed suicide by poisoning herself due to obstacles in her love with Ruan Chengji. The deceased's father claimed that Yu Aijuan, a dance hostess in the same venue as the deceased, was jealous of the deceased's flourishing dance career and therefore courted Ruan Chengji, but his daughter had no intention of marrying Ruan. One day, Yu and Ruan accompanied his daughter to a hotel, and Yu locked the two of them in a room, and then the relationship occurred. He suspected that Yu intended that his daughter would no longer dance after marrying someone, so that her dance career might be better because of this. His daughter's suicide was caused by Yu and Ruan, and so on. Prosecutor Song examined the confession and concluded that Yao Aiyao had indeed committed suicide by taking poison before her death. The body was handed over to her father, Yao Chenying, for burial. At the same time, he declared to Yao Chenying that the death of his daughter was caused by her taking poison herself and that no one else could be held responsible. As for Ruan Chengji's obstruction of morals, he could submit evidence to the court.</p>

<h3>Heavy Rain in this City Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The climate in this city has entered the plum rain season, causing the weather to be extremely unstable. The air pressure is very low, the humidity is heavy, and the rain is sometimes on and sometimes off, unpredictable. Pedestrians find it very painful. The rain suddenly stopped in the evening the day before yesterday, and the sky seemed to clear slightly. Who knew that at midnight, raindrops fell again. By about 2 AM yesterday morning, heavy rain poured down, extremely rapid. It only turned sparse after about an hour. The eaves dripped, crackling. The rain stopped at dawn. During the heavy rain, the roads were unable to drain in time, and the accumulated water reached knee-deep. Fortunately, it was late at night, and there were few pedestrians. However, in the low-lying roads such as Xinjiang Road, Xinmin Road, and Chang'an Road in Zhabei, there was still water accumulating into canals yesterday morning. Pedestrians had to hire rickshaws to ferry them across. In addition, due to the discharge of water into the river, the tide level was quite high. As for the weather yesterday, it was still very gloomy, and the clouds were surging, making it difficult to see clarity.</p>

<h3>Thefts of Iron Have Been Extremely Rampant in this City Recently</h3>
<p>Warehouse Residents' Iron Latches Were Stolen; Recently, Even the Peace Hydrants Were Stolen</p>
<p>Since Tianjin, Fujian and other places have telegraphed reports of the discovery of iron thieves, this city has also found these thieves recently. The situation is rampant. The large iron latches at the entrance of each warehouse disappear every night. Residents are also affected. There are several cases of reporting to the police station every day. However, because the whereabouts are secretive, although the various bureaus have strictly arrested them, no cases have been solved. And it has become even worse, stealing even the lids of the peace hydrants. Ordinary residents who go out in the deep night often step into the deep ponds formed after the hydrant covers are stolen, resulting in muddy satisfaction. They have reported to the police station. Director Cai has stated that these thieves are so rampant that, in addition to strictly ordering the detective team to capture them, he will also announce to the public that if any of these thieves are discovered, they should be sent to the nearest police station for legal action.</p>

<h3>A Policeman Tore an Umbrella and an Old Man Was Beaten to Death</h3>
<p>A Slight Umbrella Kills a Life</p>
<p>Zhang Yongcai, a forest policeman from Changzhou of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, was sent to manage the trees on Humin Road in Shanghai. At 4 PM the day before yesterday, he was riding a bicycle from Beiqiao to the south, holding an umbrella in one hand due to the rain. When he reached the south side of Chang'an Cemetery, he accidentally collided with Wu Xianyun (72 years old), a local who lived near Huangtuzuo and was walking from the south, causing the umbrella in his hand to be torn. The policeman got off his bicycle and grabbed Wu, ordering him to pay compensation, and a dispute occurred. The policeman was angry for a moment, raised his fist and beat him fiercely, and kicked him hard, causing Wu to fall to the ground in extreme pain. Later, nearby villagers carried the injured person to Beiqiao Sanitarium and Hospital, but because the injury was in a vital part, he could not be saved and died at about 8 PM. Director Yin of the Special Branch was furious when he learned about this and immediately detained the policeman. In addition to being sent to the hospital yesterday for strict handling, he sent personnel to investigate the family of the deceased to discuss a settlement and appease the public.</p>

<p>The Ningbo merchants in Shanghai, including Wang Beiping, Gu Heming, Zhang Deli, Hu Shicai, Yang Zaisheng, Wu Xiangeng, and Zhang Deyuan, initiated the Ning Shao Crated Tea Transportation Safety Agency, as reported previously. It is now learned that the agency has been organized and internal staff have been assigned.

It is reported that the agency sent Zhang Deli and others to Shaoxing Pingshui last week to contact Mr. Jiang Jinjiang, the chairman of the Crated Tea Association. With the support of tea merchants like Zhong Jin from Fudi Tea Company and Zhang Henian, a leader in the customs brokerage industry, they convened a meeting with colleagues who unanimously agreed to entrust all 110,000 crates of tea to the agency for security. Negotiations for other portions are ongoing.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Merchant Liang Zhuoren and Others Contract for Xiangxi Highway</h3>
<p>Recently, Ningbo merchants in Shanghai, including Liang Zhuoren, and others learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration decided to invite merchants to contract for the Xiangxi Highway. They specially united with comrades to form a company and drafted a plan to lease from the Zhejiang Construction Department and the Highway Administration. The conditions included paying a deposit of 3,000 yuan and 13% of the operating income as road rent. At the same time, merchants Wang Shaoxiong, Niu Zengyuan, and others also leased from the bureau, with conditions including a deposit of 2,000 yuan and 10% of operating income as road rent. After the news spread, the Xiang people who invested in the construction of this section of the highway sympathized with Liang's plan to increase the interest on the highway, which would benefit the investors themselves. The Highway Administration once considered and intended to sign a draft agreement with the more advantageous Liang. It is reported that Mr. Liang and others will soon go to Hangzhou again for further negotiations.</p>

<p>Liu Huai, captain of the Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Corps, received a tip that a gang of robbers would gather in an open space north of the Haiqingchi Bathhouse on Haichang Road, under the jurisdiction of the Zhabei Xinzha Police Sub-bureau, and set off to commit robbery. After receiving the report, Captain Liu remained calm and dispatched detective team leader Gu Ding, Nie Ganchen, Su Ruiting, and six others in iron vests, carrying pistols and ammunition, in a car at about 5 pm the day before. The Xinzha Sub-bureau's Detective Sixth Team also sent policemen and detectives Liu Heng, Liu Yufu, Chen Mingsheng, and others, disguised in advance, distributed around the destination, waiting until 8:50 pm. As expected, the gang of robbers arrived one after another. Upon indication by the informant, the police officers gave a signal, swarmed out, and arrested five people on the spot, seizing a pistol, three bullets, and a spent shell. According to the robbers, their names were Xun Rongjin, Fan Zengxing, Tian Wenfu, Zhu Youzhang, and Hua Xianxiang, and they confessed that accomplices were in Zhenxing Lane next to the Zhabei Grand Theater on Menggu Road and in the Pudong Concession. The police officers immediately went to Zhenxing Lane to arrest them without success, and then took the above five people to the Xinzha Sub-bureau to report. Then they were taken to the General Team for interrogation. At 11 am yesterday, a child scavenger found a pistol in the open space north of the Haiqingchi Bathhouse on Haichang Road. The child handed the pistol to the nearby patrol police, but whether it was thrown away by the robbers during the visit to the case and arrest of the robbers could not be confirmed for a while. At present, the pistol has also been sent to the Xinzha Sub-bureau to be reported to the General Bureau's Inspectorate.</p>
<h3>In Times of National Crisis, Strictly Guard Against Traitors Disguised as Begging Monks</h3>
<p>Chinese Buddhist Association Stipulates Fundraising Methods - Certificate of Proof Must Be Issued by the Buddhist Branch</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday instructed the branches of each city and county that, according to the report from the Liyang County branch, "It has been found that recently there have been monks begging in the name of repairing temples. Upon inquiry, they are evasive, causing social suspicion or being deported, affecting formal fundraising and harming the reputation of monks across the country. The association has the responsibility to supervise, and it is proposed to clearly stipulate rectification methods. If temples in various places are damaged, if it is necessary to raise funds for repairs, they should be reported to the local Buddhist branch for verification and issuance of a fundraising certificate (if there is no association, it must be certified by the district office). If fundraising in other counties, they must go to the local Buddhist branch or district office to submit a certificate of proof for verification and issuance of a permit to show prudence and deter impostors. The funds raised should be handed over to the local Buddhist branch and remitted to the Buddhist branch where the temple is located, which will be forwarded to the temple abbot for collection. (If there is no association in the local area, it should be sent directly to the temple) to show great faith in society and avoid being robbed on the way. Any fundraising monks who do not have proof from a Buddhist association or district office should be cracked down on by the Buddhist associations in various places at any time and advised to leave the country. Especially in this time of national crisis, it is feared that unscrupulous people will disguise themselves as monks, falsely raise funds, and plot wrongdoing. It is essential that the Buddhist associations conduct strict investigations to prevent chaos. Therefore, a document is submitted to your association for verification and approval, and a circular is issued to all temples and monks across the country to comply with it, and respectfully follow it. In view of this, the rectification measures proposed by the branch are feasible and should be approved. In addition to issuing separate orders, the branch shall immediately check and handle it, and forward it to all temples under its jurisdiction for their information. This order."</p>

<h3>Jinan Vessel Found to be Smuggling Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Totaling Over Ten Sacks, More Than Forty Thousand Coins</p>
<p>Since the Japanese rogues' attempts to transport copper coins by sea have been strictly investigated and repeatedly thwarted by our country's customs officers, the rogues have suffered considerable losses and are now unable to sell. They have changed their smuggling methods, taking advantage of the fact that our anti-smuggling customs officers' attention is focused on Japanese ships. Recently, they have been secretly loading copper coins onto various sea vessels bound for Hong Kong for transshipment. Customs had heard rumors of this, so they have been paying close attention when inspecting various vessels. Yesterday, when the Jinan vessel, sailing to Hong Kong and Xiamen, was scheduled to weigh anchor at 12:00, customs officers, as usual, boarded at 11:00 to conduct a thorough search before export. During the search, they discovered over ten sacks of unclaimed items in the bow of the ship. Upon inspection, they were found to be full of copper coins, estimated to be more than forty thousand. They were transported back to customs and confiscated. This is the first time such a large quantity of copper coins has been found on a sea vessel.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Dancing in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>Dancing in Shanghai has recently reached its peak. There are no fewer than twenty dance halls, big and small, in the city, and even more dance schools. This abnormal development has naturally caused unease among the "defenders of morality." Some passively shake their heads and sigh at the "decline of social customs," while others actively petitioned to ban dance halls. Later, a compromise was reached: dance halls could not operate past midnight, and the education sector prohibited middle school students from dancing. At the time, public opinion was not unified, and now there are still dance halls that "operate all night" and students wearing the most fashionable Western clothes who are dating dance hostesses.</p>
<p>Indeed, to say that dancing is an art is too beautiful a disguise. To say it is exercise seems even further from the truth. The reason dancing halls are so developed in Shanghai is simply because they are entertainment. It is a more advanced, peculiar (Grotesque), and erotic entertainment than watching movies or visiting brothels. And entertainment is as important to the common people as water is to fish.</p>
<p>Although during the "serious national crisis," dancing was once raised as a banner for "national salvation," that was because the personal relationships of those involved in dancing were not suitable as a permanent example.</p>
<p>Moreover, the lower classes not only want to "dance" but also like to "watch." By "watch," they naturally do not mean going to dance halls to "decipher characters," watching people flirt with dance hostesses on the dance floor, because they themselves have played such a role before. Over time, familiarity breeds contempt, and the "peculiar" becomes "ordinary." So, they want to "watch" naked bodies wearing bras and thongs swimming like snakes on stage. Also, a type of dance that specializes in swaying hips, called the hula dance, is the most popular. Usually, white Russian women perform the most in low-grade movie theaters. As for the "Kaleidoscope Troupe" and the "New 9 O'Clock Dance Troupe," which are directly imported from abroad, they are naturally even more popular. Because Western women have healthy bodies and can maximize the stimulation that the audience hopes for. These dance troupes can often make huge profits and return fully loaded.</p>
<p>However, at some point, Peking Opera, with red-faced and black-faced characters fighting, also began to use "sensual dancing" as a selling point. Peking Opera in Shanghai has declined sharply in recent years. Except for famous performers from Beijing and Tianjin who can still attract opera fans, theaters that specialize in continuous plays can only make efforts in the novelty and mystery of scenery and stage machinery. Finally, they have developed to the point where mandarin robes and jade legs fly together, and painted faces share the same lipstick color. I have little affinity for Peking Opera, but according to friends who have seen it, the dancing girls have neither been trained nor are they physically strong. Watching them strain their voices and wave their arms and legs on stage, one feels a little unbearable. There is no time for sympathy, let alone "stimulation"! This friend naturally cannot represent the views of the entire audience. After all, watching a play is just watching a play, not going to a disaster area to provide relief. This kind of psychoanalysis is superfluous. However, recently, the Municipal Council, because of the insertion of dancing in Peking Opera, believes that it is detrimental to public morals and will ban it. Since it is said to be "detrimental to public morals," my friend's words seem even more unreliable, because according to his "view," it should be "relief," not "prohibition." However, these matters do not require us to advise. Saying that it is "unbearable" and requires "relief" is the responsibility of philanthropists; saying that it is "detrimental to public morals" and should be "prohibited" is naturally the responsibility of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>In my opinion, abnormal development is temporary, and the lower classes' need for "stimulation" will not be "satisfied" in this way. Dance halls that hold "robe dances" have also failed to attract dancers, and the "view" of some others is "unbearable." Further development is naturally even more "peculiar" and "erotic," until people like my friend "cannot bear to look" and then stop.</p>
<h3>A Plea for the Compatriots in Attic Rooms</h3>
<p>— Ni Runzhi</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession's Municipal Council proposed the demolition of attic rooms within the concession, the people who feel most uneasy about this issue are not the residents of the attic rooms, but the people who exploit and are exploited by others, namely the so-called second landlords, third landlords, and the owners of stores. In fact, because the actual residents of the attic rooms have long become the dregs of the dregs in this capitalist society, even if the Municipal Council really cancels their little right to inhuman living in the attic rooms, some compatriots who depend on the store owners (including apprentices, clerks, and servants) have interests that can be extracted from them. Of course, someone will naturally arrange for them. Another group of attic room compatriots who are oppressed by second and third landlords (including coolies, rickshaw pullers, cart pushers, petty thieves, letter writers, cobblers, hawkers, street performers, boxers, peddlers of plasters, petty hooligans, pickpockets, extras in theaters and amusement parks, odd-job actors, bag carriers, tea servers, and a small number of laborers, musicians in brothels, miscellaneous servants, etc.) are not dependent on anyone, but they are very casual. One reason is that most of their occupations are free among the free, and second, for them, whether it is an attic room or a corner of a wall, or even in the open air, in their intuition, except for a few hours of slightly tolerable sleep at night, everyone clearly understands that the latter is better than the former. Therefore, whether it is at the entrance of an alley, under an overpass, in a corner of a wall, or in a small inn with three-story bunk beds, they can all use them casually, and there is absolutely no difference in their enjoyment. Among them, perhaps some people will naturally shout out, "Go to Zhabei, go to Nanshi."</p>
<p>The facts are of course very ordinary and have long been understood and understood by the general public, but I am very strange and also very depressed. I don't know if the people living in Western-style buildings and the people living in attic rooms are equally human? Do they pay taxes in the concession in the same way? On what basis does the Municipal Council want to discriminate against this group of people living in attic rooms? If it is said that they are unsanitary and unsafe, then since the Municipal Council has collected the taxes they pay, it should do its utmost to ensure their safety and sanitation. It cannot take their money and not help them avoid disasters! In any case, the fact is in front of us: the people living in attic rooms do not lack understanding of hygiene, but they lack the ability to be hygienic. They also know that sleeping in an attic room is much safer than sleeping on the street! Therefore, I say that the clever authorities of the Municipal Council should also carefully review their responsibilities. Although you have "militarism" as your only magic weapon for governing the common people, but——when the coal in the dried-up coal stove cannot be burned, the dry ashes blown up by the strong wind may blur people's eyes——what's more, there are more than 80,000 attic rooms, and the number of people exceeds 100,000!</p>
<p>Taking a step back and assuming that you really demolish these more than 80,000 attic rooms, may I ask the authorities of the Municipal Council, can you ensure that these more than 100,000 dregs of humanity swept out of the attic rooms will not become more unsafe and unsanitary because they have nowhere to stay and are scattered in the streets and alleys? After the second and third landlords lose these more than 100,000 dregs of humanity who can be exploited, will they still be able to obediently or have the ability to bear all the expenses for the Municipal Council (referring to the payment of taxes)? Will it cause a further increase in empty houses within the concession? Everything, everything, is a very problematic thing! Clever authorities of the Municipal Council, I think it is better to take a long-term view and come up with a proper solution!</p>
<h3>Funeral</h3>
<p>— Shisi</p>
<p>——Random Travel Notes, Part Two</p>
<p>Traveling south along the Bolcar River, it gets warmer day by day. May in the south is especially noisy and warm. The scorching sun scorches our group of travelers. Our originally brown skin has become even darker. Sometimes, the strong shoulder muscles even feel prickly pain due to the friction of the luggage bag. The heat of the sun dazes our minds, making us so uncomfortable.</p>
<p>However, we are voluntary travelers, young people of the white and yellow races. We are going to Valera in the extreme south, the holy land of the south,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>a city as beautiful as a flower and as dreamlike as a secluded valley! The same admiration and expectation for that secluded city, and the love of travel life, have brought us together collectively without borders or nationalities. We are as loving as brothers!</p>
<p>The Bolcar River flows slowly, sparkling with silver waves in the May sun. The water is so clear and blue. Small boats with white sails float lightly on the water. The banks are full of lush green banana trees. The river stretches out endlessly, and the green of the banks stretches out endlessly. We walked on the yellow sand and mud road with strong steps. Sweat soaked our backs, soaked our whole bodies. The weather is hot, and the clear water in the river entices each of us.</p>
<p>"Let's rest..." someone was saying.</p>
<p>"It's not far. There is a coconut grove ahead. Let's rest there!"</p>
<p>Ilauiel, who was closely following behind me, said. He is a strong Spaniard. He has lovely curly hair, lively big eyes, and a straight and high nose. Everyone likes him. He is gentle and strong, a socialist who fled from his country for ××××. This time, he wants to find a way to transfer from Valera and secretly return to his country. I have a good relationship with him.</p>
<p>It was a starry and moonlit night, still in Kotalcar, when I was enjoying the cool with him on the prairie. He said to me:</p>
<p>"From Valera, I want to transfer back to Spain."</p>
<p>"Oh, why?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>That night, he told me everything about himself. He said that he wanted to go back to continue the struggle. There, many kind comrades were waiting for him, and those rebellious and evil fascists, he wanted to go back.</p>
<p>"The coconut grove is here, let's rest." Ilauiel was so happy.</p>
<p>We stopped. We spread out the simple luggage of the travelers under the coconut trees. The warm and cool wind blew on us, and we felt a burst of coolness. We were all so happy. Some people knocked down the coconuts one by one, and everyone rushed to pick them up and share them.</p>
<p>The Bolcar River sparkles with silver waves in the sun. It is so clear. So, one after another, we all jumped into the Bolcar River. The water is warm and cool, comfortable. A naked body in the water is like sleeping on Giemons.</p>
<p>The scorching sun of May in the south can no longer make us feel hot. We floated in the water as we pleased, floating to the distance of the river.</p>
<p>"Come on..." It was such a high-pitched, short, and panting call. The second sound could no longer be heard.</p>
<p>A large splash of water was floating on the distant river, floating, floating... and never floated up again. Who can reach there quickly!</p>
<p>Two hours later, Ilauiel lay quietly in the coconut grove. His originally strong body seemed a little fatter, but it was. He was lying so quietly, but he would never wake up.</p>
<p>Night came. The wind was blowing the coconut leaves, making a "click, click..." sound. Around Ilauiel, gas lamps were lit, illuminating the forest as bright as day. However, no one spoke, only the sound of swaying leaves, only the sound of the wind. There was no moon or stars in the sky. It was a dark night. The Bolcar River had disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>We all stood up and stood around Ilauiel. The lights illuminated everyone's sad faces. Everyone was silent.</p>
<p>The May night wind was sighing, and the jungle was also crying.</p>
<p>Who picked up the iron shovel and shoveled the first shovel? The soil will swallow our dear companion!</p>
<p>My blood tensed up, like a thorny iron hammer heavily hitting my heart. I dropped the iron shovel in my hand and slumped to the ground with my head in my hands.</p>
<p>The soil finally swallowed Ilauiel. He lay under the mound of earth with a wooden axe and sickle inserted.</p>
<p>Everyone sat down around the mound, bowing their heads, without even sighing.</p>
<p>The wind shook the coconut trees, and the coconut trees sang "click, click..." sadly. There were no stars or moon in the sky, a dark night. The Bolcar River disappeared into the darkness, boundless darkness, endless night. Ilauiel is gone. The kind comrades in distant Spain will forever be suspicious, expectant, and nostalgic for Ilauiel. He is a mystery.</p>
<p>Boundless darkness, endless night, the night of the dark Bolcar River, the sad coconut grove, the travelers sitting around, holding, a sad funeral!</p>
<h3>Song of the Sea</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>On a starry night, the sea is singing again.</p>
<p>The sea is born to be a talented singer. It has the passion of a poet and the heroic spirit of a martyr. Like a galloping horse, it whips up wave after wave with lightning speed. Nothing can stop it. These waves can also be described as its power and prestige.</p>
<p>The sea is the world's first laborer. Even when it is resting, it struggles to swing its giant body and stretch its limbs, unwilling to show weakness.</p>
<p>The rocks on the shore become thicker and thicker, but can this stop the sea's roar and impact? Every moment, it still uses its brave nature to smash its head desperately against the rocks. Over time, the rocks gradually tremble. They cannot withstand the sea's grinding and torment. A hard body is swallowed into a weak appearance, only increasing the beauty of the external form.</p>
<p>The sea sings and struggles tirelessly.</p>
<p>The sea has the freedom to surge and an endless ambition!</p>
