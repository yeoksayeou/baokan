<h3>我左翼陣地屹然未動右翼防綫移至新陣地</h3>
<p>精銳部隊奉命誓守南市　石湖蕩敵軍被我包圍中　松江南門外有激烈戰事</p>
<p>滬西我軍後移後、茲悉我左翼陣地、自瀏河經施相公廟•廣福•小南翔以迄蘇州河北岸濱之姚家渡一綫、未受絲毫影響、仍屹然未動、至蘇州河南之我軍新陣地、則自河濱之南華公路上一點起、南迤而經虹橋飛機場以至七寶鎮（計西距租界約八公里）復折而東行、沿漕寶公路而至龍華、（計南距蘇州河約七公里）至南市方面、則由某師有力部隊及全市警察作孤軍之死守、是以血戰行將三月之滬戰、現仍在繼續進行之中、我軍事發言人對此次我軍陣地之移動、向記者發表談話稱、自八一三敵軍發動戰事後、我忠勇將士以血肉之軀、與敵軍猛烈之砲火拼死苦鬥、三閱月來、始終在蕞爾彈丸之區、與敵軍作一村一莊之爭奪、並予以重大之創傷、英武神勇、已使全世界驚嘆賛服、現在戰爭仍在滬區之內進行未已、距我軍預定與敵作殊死戰之國防陣綫尚遠、有此偉大之戰蹟、則目前之形勢、不但不應認為軍事上之失敗、卽使將來我軍再向後移、退至國防綫上、與敵决戰、亦益可堅信我軍在長期抗戰中、必能爭取最後勝利、是以抗戰前途、至為樂觀、全國人民均應抱定勿驕勿餒之意志、與敵堅持到底云、</p>
<p>本市市長兪鴻鈞氏、昨對記者發表談話云、我軍雖奉令撤至新陣綫、但仍扼守南市浦東及蒲淞漕河涇等區、以捍衛國土、溯自八一三以來、敵軍藉口所謂虹橋事什、調派大軍來滬、圖遂其侵略之野心、我為自衛計、不得不奮起抗戰、上海不幸、遂遭戰禍、敵雖有精銳之武器、但我為正義而戰、故軍民恊力、將士用命、三月以來、迭予敵以重大之打擊、雖寸土之進退、必取償相當之代價、自江灣閘北相繼淪陷敵手後、我堅守西區、已逾兩週、現旣由西區自動撤退、但仍固守南市、南市雖非軍事重地、惟旣奉最高軍事當局之命令、惟有督率員警、恊助國軍、誓死抗守、使區內居民、得從容遷避、以免受敵人之慘殺、得保留一人、卽增厚一分抗戰實力、設南市不幸、一旦失守、致全市淪亡、但我上海市人民之精神、固將垂諸永久、至於本人、則惟有聽命中央為國努力云、</p>
<h3>我軍收復松隱等地後乘勝推進包圍殘敵</h3>
<p>犯石湖蕩之敵亦被我軍截斷後路</p>
<p>中央社杭州八日電、先後盤據漕涇•亭林•張堰•松隱•新倉•干巷•數地之敵•由四五百人增達四千人左右、分兩路犯松江、以猛烈砲火壓迫我平湖松江、七日曾一度吃緊、後經我生力軍趕到、予以痛擊、敵不支乃由金絲娘橋•金山衛兩路潰退、我軍當卽先後收復松隱•亭林•千巷•及太平橋•各地、並乘勝推進、包圍掃蕩、八日晨被圍之敵已殱滅過半、現我軍仍在圍剿中、八日晨、因天晴敵機又四出活躍、掩護敵軍突圍、</p>
<p>盤據於浦江上游米市渡一帶之敵、約數百人、前晚竄至汆來廟江水最狹處、偸渡登岸、至離松江南門外六七里之張家村、企圖進擾石湖蕩、該處我有重兵駐守、敵雖頑强、終難得逞、惟前夜張家村附近、我軍堅强抗敵、戰事猛烈、松江城內槍砲聲、淸晰可聞、一時風聲鶴唳、大有草木皆兵之概、幸賴我忠勇將士、猛力抵禦、殺敵百餘人、敵勢銳减、昨晨該方稍見安靜、我軍已佔絕對優勢、人心於是大定、</p>
<h3>敵竄石湖蕩我包圍痛剿</h3>
<p>中央社隨軍記者九日晚十二時報告、在金山衛登岸竄至石湖蕩、張莊市之一部敵軍、經我大軍迎擊、於午後四時許、已將其後路截斷、敵遂陷於我軍大包圍之中、敵雖頑强突擊、但經我痛剿、已殱滅二百餘、俘獲二十餘、並繳得槍械甚多、</p>
<h3>敵進犯奉賢我分頭追擊</h3>
<p>敵在漕涇、金絲娘廟登後、卽由奉賢進犯亭林•蔣莊等處、後又西攻葉榭、東犯盛梓廟、吾軍在小周家墳奮勇抵抗、殺敵甚多、至七日晚、忽探報柘林錢家橋兩處海灘、敵亦登陸、夜半南橋又忽起火、在柘林錢家橋海灘之敵、更有直撲西新市•靑村•奉城之說、故行政機關如縣府等各局所、不得不退至安全地帶、現在吾軍正在抵抗中、同時各地壯丁隊、及別動隊、亦分頭據要追擊、勢頗勇猛、</p>
<h3>我壯士誓守南市</h3>
<p>日暉港與敵隔河對峙　工事堅强必抗戰到底</p>
<p>中央社云、滬西蘇州河南岸之我軍、為調整陣地再作戰略上必要之後移、但最高當局下令固守、南市奉令之將士亦以必死之决心、誓與敵軍奮鬥到底、同時浦東方面、尚無異動、是以血戰八十八日之上海戰事、不但並未終結、且為長期抗戰之局面、打出更有利之形勢、此為全國同胞所應深切認識者也、當上月二十六日閘北我軍後撤、退守蘇州河南岸後、我忠勇將士、憑粗率之工事、與敵血戰苦鬥、以歷兩週、士氣壯盛、英武非凡、迭與渡河南犯之敵軍以莫大之創傷、惟敵陸空兩軍、集中猛烈之砲火不斷轟炸、致我陣地工事被燬甚多、同時在金山嘴登陸之敵、集中力量向前推進、猛撲松江、致滬西我軍感受威脅、不得不作戰略上之移動、昨晨一時半以前、隔朱家浜對峙之兩軍、猶砲火連天、激戰不休、惟我軍大隊則在前綫苦戰之掩護下、作有秩序之後移、二時左右、我軍先將豐田紗廠周家橋兩據點放棄、退至光華大學西沿東西杜宅迄北新涇南馬溝橋一綫、至三時左右、朱家浜一綫、亦沿庇亞士路向南移動、至五時左右、陸家宅在北岸一帶激戰、將敵軍前哨兩百餘人完全包圍殱滅後、我軍遂完全退至新陣地、沿七寶一綫死守、同時南市方面、亦由當局下令警察局長蔡勁軍、率全市警察及某師有力部隊死守、决不放棄、我軍士氣旺盛、有增無减、現正嚴陣以待、誓與暴敵抗戰到底、</p>
<h3>保衛南市陣地鞏固</h3>
<p>我軍奉令、堅守南市之部隊、已有嚴密之戒備、其主要陣地、為沿日暉港自法租界南首邊境、以至黃浦江沿岸、所有橋樑、已經炸燬、其防禦工事、鞏固異常、昨日正午時、我軍前哨尚在徐家匯謹記路一帶、敵由蘇州河南岸繞道滬西、向我進犯時、與我少數前哨部隊、發生接觸、敵雖擁有步兵三百人、坦克車五輛、及小砲八門、但為我軍截住、予以重創後、始向東移退、至午後四時、敵進至日暉港西岸、與我對峙、至晚、敵卽在士山灣•謹記路•楓林橋•及斜土路一帶、構築工事、至於沿黃浦江方面、尚無敵踪、我軍警及保安隊、已劃定防區、密切合作、嚴陣以待、與敵周旋、</p>
<h3>日暉港西敵築工事</h3>
<p>又今晨三時本報接得最後報告、日暉港西岸敵軍、入晚來尚在龍華路大木橋與小木橋之間、趕築工事、其先頭部隊、卽在該處附近張家宅民房內、距離日暉港岸尚有七百公尺至一千公尺、我軍在日暉港東岸、以迄黃浦江面一帶、憑岸堅守、南市方面、秩序安甯如常、</p>
<h3>租界當局加緊防務</h3>
<p>上海法租界駐防法軍及警務當局、鑒於昨（九日）日形勢緊張、特於午後在沿日暉港徐家匯等處、加緊防務、開出鐵甲車小鋼砲多輛、分駐河浜各處鐵柵門、以維租界安全、</p>
<p>昨日午前據楓林橋逃出之居民云、敵軍於午後進抵老龍華、在龍華塔上及鎮束高屋上、均扯有日旗午後二時、敵軍進抵斜徐路、法租界當局派出法陸軍一小隊約二十餘人、在打浦路橋一帶駐守、以防萬一、</p>
<h3>蔡局長談奮鬥到底</h3>
<p>中央社云、警察局長蔡勁軍氏、奉命固守南市、已督率所屬、拚死抗禦、决保此淞滬最後一塊土地、與整個上海共存亡、據語記者云、此次我軍調整陣綫、向西南移撤、南市防務、絕無影響、目前南市防務、異常鞏固、外傳種種、絕對不確、警察實力、雖較單薄、但衛民守土、為我天職、溯自淞滬抗戰以來、本局全體動員、除努力維持治安、救濟難民外、亦曾恊同國軍、作戰於市中心諸役、迭建光榮之戰績、現國軍因戰略關係、暫時西移、本局職責所在、决本領袖與政府意旨、從國軍之後、固守南市、卽剩一槍一彈、亦必奮鬥到底、决不輕易讓敵人完全佔領上海、俾為國家爭人格、民族爭光榮、本人分屬軍人、唯有以死報國、請將此意轉告國人、至本局官警、均深明大義、身負艱鉅、必能慷慨赴難云、</p>
<h3>敵機竟日轟炸南市慘遭火刼</h3>
<p>數萬難民倉皇逃生　大哭小喊慘不忍覩</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日（九日）黎明起、卽有敵機飛往南市及浦東上空、每次少則一二架、多則五六架、輪流往來、盤旋窺察、迄下午三時半後、有敵機十二架、分作五批、首二批各三架、後三批各二架、陸續飛赴南市及浦東上空濫肆轟炸、在浦東楊家渡張家浜一帶、投彈二十餘枚、損失未詳、在南市高昌廟江南造船所附近、先後投彈竟逹二十二枚之多、彈落火起、燃燒頗烈、迄晚尚未息滅、在製造局路伯特利醫院投二彈、落於空地、無損失、在南火車站附近投二彈、有路軌一段被毀、</p>
<h3>光華大學被敵焚燬</h3>
<p>國民社云、滬西蘇州河南岸我駐軍、昨晨因戰略關係、向後撤退後、敵軍卽進抵楓林橋•大西路光華大學、已被敵軍焚燬、此為其燬滅我文化機關之一貫手段、</p>
<p>大公社云、滬西中山路底及華倫路方面、於昨晨零時起、突着彈起火延燒、一時黑烟冲天、至為猛烈、聞該地一帶民房工廠、多數被毀、損失殊巨云、</p>
<h3>南市民房延燒慘烈</h3>
<p>昨日南市方面敵機多架、於淸晨八時起、在外日暉橋斜土路一帶、投擲燒夷彈、該處以草棚為多、於是遂起大火、延燒至下午未熄、該處所有之小工廠及草房、盡付一炬、南市居民、往租界逃奔者、如潮湧至、方浜橋一帶、途為之塞、另有一班難民扶老携幼、逃往城內難民區之城隍廟內露宿、厥狀殊慘、</p>
<p>又午後二時餘、滬杭甬車站方面、又發生火災、頓時烈燄高冲、不可嚮邇、火勢之猛烈、雖遠在租界之屋頂、亦能觀見、</p>
<p>又午後三時餘、有敵機兩隊六架、盤旋於滬西斜徐路局門路一帶天空、輪流投彈、當有多處起火、頓時烈燄冲天、延燒甚久、</p>
<h3>烈火之下泅水逃生</h3>
<p>昨晨天明五時餘、滬西打浦路方面突然發生火災、自日暉港（卽斜徐路橋）橋以西中國鉛筆廠之南一帶、火勢頗旺、被焚者卽大上海套鞋廠全部、及平民住屋草棚等、共燬百餘十間、法捕房救火車聞警趕到、因河浜阻隔、停泊於浜北岸不能施展營救火工作、南岸居民泅水渡河者、擁擠異常、直至二時火勢甚烈、致延燒新國民漿印公司門口之斜徐路橋、據該處逃岀之難民云、起火者共有四五處之多、故打浦路東西各工廠、波累者頗為不少、延燒面積甚廣、直至下午三時許、雖火勢稍殺、猶未完全熄滅、</p>
<h3>數萬難民大哭小喊</h3>
<p>昨日午午後滬地四郊形勢更為緊張、龍華漕河涇日暉港等滬西南一帶難民、携老牽幼、紛紛徒步沿港而下者、竟有四五萬人、擬入法租界、惟沿日暉港法租界方面均有鐵絲網隔斷、卽有渡船亦不得過、以致在各處鐵柵門外、擁得水洩不通、大哭小喊、慘痛異常、</p>
<h3>慈善體團派車營救</h3>
<p>新新社云、我軍後移堅守新陣地後、滬郊四鄕居民、因不堪慘遭敵人殘殺、均紛紛扶老携幼向滬逃避、聚集於滬閔路途中、狀殊可憫、本市慈善團體聞報、卽派大批救護車輛前往營救、至傍晚返滬、救出難民約四百餘人、遂送至南市難民區該會收容所安置、並據某救護員云、敵機時在難民麕集處盤旋、並以機槍掃射、當由本會派員冒險營救時、約有數十名難民、不幸遭受慘殺云、</p>
<h3>切勿動搖信念潘公展</h3>
<p>保衛大上海</p>
<p>當我軍由江灣閘北撤退時我曾經敬告市民、切勿視為放棄土海、現在我軍再由滬西作戰略上的撤退、我仍然要大聲疾呼地敬告市民、切勿視為放棄上海、姑無論我軍警還要奉命固守南市、將與陣地共存亡、縱使有一天也因為地勢和戰略的關係而忍痛地撤退、也决不能認為我們甘願放棄上海總之“保衛大上海”是我們全民的期望、也是我們全民的信念、無論軍事形勢變化如何、這信念是要始終牢固而不㧞的、</p>
<p>或許有人說徒有這信念而無力量有什麼用、殊不知信念是精神的作用、有了信念、才可以發生力量、我們要有“保衛大上海”的力量、先須確有“保衛大上海”的信心、假使信心先自己搖動了、還談什麼力量、我們第一須切實覺悟抗戰的責任、不能獨責望於軍隊、“保衛大上海”的任務、須由全市市民很堅忍的担負起來、如果上海的市民們、人人見危授命、臨難母苟免精神上一致團結着、眞能有錢的出錢、有力的出力、威武不能屈、富貴不能淫、貧賤不能移、繼續邁進百折不回、我想以大上海的地位、大上海的財力、就是對於保衛全國也都可有很大的貢獻、何况僅僅保衛一個上海市、假使因為軍隊一時的撤退、而就動搖了、我們的信念、以為大上海從此完了、將無可保衛了、這就無異承認抗戰只是軍隊的事、將何詞以解“全民抗戰”、</p>
<p>其次、我們須明白認識、三個月以來的淞滬抗戰、實在祗是全面抗戰和持久抗戰的開始、我軍雖先後自江灣閘北滬西陸續撤退、但在三個月浴血抗戰期間、消耗了敵人無數的物質、削弱了敵人無數的戰鬥力、在全面抗戰的意義上、仍然是勝利的、而且就戰陣的形勢而言、一方面我們還守着南市、一方面嘉定至南翔之間的大軍陣地、依然稳固異常、則今日為戰略而退、安知他日不因戰略而進、只要我們愛國的市民們與忠勇的將士們、在精神上始終聯繫着、互相援助、互相勉勵、則目前退却的陣地必有收復的一天、換言之“保衛大上海”、在最後必能完成其任務、在這個軍事倉皇人心浮動的時候、我們尤其需要把握我們的信念、不讓漢奸活躍、不讓傀儡現形、用着我們團結一致的精神、鼓起我們百折不回的毅力、築成“保衛大上海”的上城、</p>

<h3>領土主權一日不獲承認我國誓必抗戰到底</h3>
<p>日本實力消耗非德意之所願　遠東和平恢復列强均所關心　倫敦泰晤士報評論一針見血</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報今日載有社論、謂意大利之加入反共協定、僅爲重行表白意大利憎惡與畏懼共產主義、若干評論家雖圖使三國之鄰邦爲之驚心動魄、但目前以就該協定表面之價値接受之、較爲得計、同時白魯塞爾會議以實事求是是重、其致日本之申請書措詞婉轉、使日本如予接受、可以表示其所願與討論和局之列强、德意兩國皆深切關心中國和平之恢復、兩國皆恐日本戰全筋疲力盡、又恐中國因戰事而紛擾、致共産主義乘機侵入、該報相信中國非至達到其目的、或確無達到目的之望時、决不願停止戰事、中國一日有繼續抗戰之能力、其政府一日不能與日本議和、而聽日本控制中國土地一大部分、中國此次與侵略者作殊死戰、非常勇武、今雖漸覺艱苦、但全國抗戰之志極形熱烈、不根據承認中國權利之解决、徒足延長戰事而不能奠定和平云、（中央社九日路透電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］英外相艾登自返國之後、原擬留居倫敦、不再參加九國公約會議、茲突於今晨首途赴比京、殊出人意料之外、英國半官界人士咸謂九國公約會議或當大見發展、必須外相親自一行、外相到達後、會議主席卽比國前外長斯巴克、卽當與之會晤、俾就會議進行情形交換意見、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>⊙比京　九國公約會議各國代表、今日一致希望日本對於比政府之復文、將出以微妙之措辭、使將來調解之鬥繼續開放、一面乘機進行其軍事行動、以達其目的、一部份外交家相信、日本對於九國公約會議所指定之小組委員會、如無蘇俄在內或可與之合作、以謀解决遠東局勢、亦未可知、惟另一部份外交家對於根據何種基礎進行調解、不無懷疑、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>我决拒絕會外調停否認進行直接交涉</h3>
<p>⊙比京中國代表團今日宣稱、中國政府對於任何未與會第三國之調停、勢必拒絕、蓋堅持中日交涉、惟有以九國公約爲基礎、始能獲得滿意之解决云、（八日海通電）</p>

<p>［柏林］半官機關德意志通信社頃發表消息云、美英與蘇聯、現擬利用九國公約會議、舉行政治的示威、以反對十一月六日意德日所簽訂之反共公約、英外相艾登、已自倫敦重返比京、携有演說底稿、凖備在九國公約會該議發表、此項演說詞當先與美代表商得同意、又美首席代表台維斯與蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫、日昨在比京舉行談話所商者亦卽此事云、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於德國調處中日爭端事、外間仍傳聞甚盛、此間政界人士頗爲之驚異、並謂此說已由中日兩國政府加以否認、自無足置信、惟外间旣有此種傳聞、是見德國在各大國中所處地位頗爲重要云、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本傳有參加可能週五閣議最後决定</h3>
<p>⊙白魯塞爾　茲據比京與日大使館極接近方面所發出之聲明、日本已有參加九國公約會議之可能、並謂日本爲履行九國公約之條文起見、已與英美法意等國代表在東京進行充分而坦白之商討云、該聲明復稱、現在之會議、係由國聯所授意、並有蘇聯參加、蘇聯並非公約簽字國、故倘日本肯派遣代表參加會議、實屬日本方面調解精神之重要表示、並爲眞實之讓步云、（中央社九日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］日外相廣田於今日閣議宣稱、關於比京會議邀請日本出席、合作解决中日糾紛一節、需要相當時間考慮、須在十二日之下次閣議、始能决定、（九日海通電）</p>
<h3>會議前途難有成就美國輿論界之觀察</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］關於國際時局情形、美國輿論咸以全世界外交局勢、錯綜複雜爲慮、此可於各報評論與私人談話中覘之、此間一般人均以爲九國公約會議絕難有所成就、意德日三國反共公約所載條款、已爲外間所知者、且危險程度雖不甚大、但各該國所組成之新同盟、已在世界政局上樹立一種基礎、其活動範圍幾無以限制之、緣各該國可以剷除共產主義爲名、而利用種種口實、任便在全世界各處單獨或聯合有所舉動故也、一般人並以爲意德日三國卽當設法促使歐洲各國加入反共公約卽美洲各國亦當設法招致之、果爾、則南北美洲各國思想上之統一局面旣因而感受威脅、卽汎美洲會議去歲所組成之聯合陣綫、（用以防止美洲以外各國干涉美洲事件）亦有破壞之虞矣、以言遠東現行局勢、羅斯福總統前於十月六日在芝加哥城發表演說之後、原有進一步表示之可能、特恐美國輿論仍復傾向保守、而意德日三國反共公約之成立、又足以促其回復孤立主義耳、時至此日、美國國會復會在即、羅斯福總統即欲有所表示、實亦不無躊躇之色云、（中史社八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蔣百里將軍晤意代表</h3>
<p>于斌主敎謁比王</p>
<p>⊙比京　蔣百里將軍昨與于斌主敎訪晤意代表阿杜魯文迪、會談頗久、蔣將軍定今晚返柏林、並將赴羅馬候晤陳公博、預定在羅馬逗留約十日、又蔣氏允爲德國官方軍事報紙著文、論中國之抗戰與將來之勝利云、（九日中央社電）</p>

<h3>意加入反共公約蘇聯對意抗議</h3>
<p>認爲違反友好條約　兩國關係不絕如縷</p>
<p>［羅馬］蘇聯對於意大利之加入德意日三國共公約、現已正式提出抗議、據聞蘇聯大使已照會意外相齊亞諾稱、蘇認意大利之參加該協定、爲“不友善之舉動、”蘇聯並責意政府違反蘇意間一九三三年所訂立之友善條約、並查昨日蘇聯大使訪問義外相時、外相曾聲明該協定之用意、爲反對第三國際而非反對蘇聯、因此蘇聯之反對、實無存在之理由、後大使卽將意外相之意見、呈報本國政府、經其本國政府訓令後、始向意政府提出正式抗議、再則波蘭大使昨日亦曾訪問意外相、對於協定有所商談、但否認曾論及波蘭加入該公約之事、（中央社九日路透電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］據政界人士相信、齊氏對蘇聯此項抗議、將拒不受理、其理由爲防共協定并不反對任何國家、且歡迎各國自由加入云、（八日海通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此聞今晨各報、對蘇聯向意抗議、及近來意蘇間之緊張局勢、有所評論、各報意見一致認爲如蘇意斷絕外交關係、並不足異云、（九日海通電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］據羅馬方面傳來消息、德意兩國業已由日政府允許、在日本所佔領之中國土地內、畀以經濟利益、此說倘經徵實、則官方人士必須進行調查、蓋德意日三國如確曾訂結此項經濟協定、則對於中國門戶開放之原則、實大相背謬也、惟至目前爲止、尚無法徵實德意日三國間有對華經濟協定之存在云、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙捷京　關於意德日所簽訂之反共公約、捷京日報頃加以評論云、“此項協定在表面上、雖係反對蘇聯、實係反對英美法三國、蓋就地勢而論、蘇聯並不感受威脅、反之、英國在新加坡•法國在越南•及美國在太平洋上之海軍根據地、均受日本之威脅、此外埃及亦受意大利之威脅、而倫敦與巴黎兩處則受德國之威脅、今後意德日三國儘可指稱某某民治國參加“第三國際之破壞行動”而干涉其內政、由此観之、反共公約實與現代國家關係最重要之原則相違反、原則維何、即他國內政不得加以干涉是也”云、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［柏林］美國輿論界對意德日反共公約、日來紛紛加以評論、德外交界人士因而發生不良印象、晚報載稱、“此項協定之目標、不在用武力壓制業已存在之革命運動、但在阻止未發生之革命運動勿令爆發、一國之內若果發現共產主義、自當由該國用本身力量予以掃除也”云、（中央社八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>鉅量黃金由美運法</h3>

<p>共値一萬四千餘鎊</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日英下院曾討論及英國軍火出口運赴日本一事、商務大臣史丹萊於答復質問時稱、一英政府前此已曾聲明、爲公衆利益起見、政府所發給軍械軍火之出口執照及其目的地等、其內容仍不擬加以公佈、但余所可言者、卽自七月一日至九月三十日之中、英國運往日本之軍械子彈陸海軍軍需品等、總値爲一萬四千六百十二鎊、由此數可見英軍火運日數量、在最近數月之中、己减至極低之程度云、”（中央社八日路透電）</p>

<h3>死守南市</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>滬西蘇州河南岸的我軍。昨日再作戰略上必要的後移。但南市方面我最高當局郤下令警察局長蔡勁軍。率同全市警察及某師有力部隊死守。决不放棄。南市防禦工事經數月來的構築已相當堅固。且房屋鱗次櫛比。正與闡北相同。也是容易防守的條件。敵人如要奪取南市。完成佔領上海的企圖。恐怕還得遭受相當重大的犧牲和消耗罷。</p>
<p>死守南市正同死守太原一樣。在軍事上的意義還小。在政治上的意義却大。因爲上海和太原這兩個城市正是敵人速戰速决目標的象徵。卽使到底免不了要失守。對於國際的視聽。國內的人心。也總是多守一天好一天。此其一。上海和太原在我國政治上經濟上都佔有重要的地位。敵人要奪取這兩大城布。爲的是要控制政治的經濟的勢力。如果我們採取了焦土抗戰的策略。敵人就很難達到他的目的了。此其二。</p>
<p>當然。在今日軍事形勢之下。死守南市的舉動是悲壯的。守軍的數目有限。又大部分是警察。要抗抵大量敵軍的進攻。畢竟是一個悲劇。而且南市這一個繁盛區域再經過一度防禦戰。勢必也要變成廢墟。然而我們須知我們是爲全民族而抗戰。如果局部的災難可以換取全民族的光榮。這災難就値得後世水遠的謳歌了。</p>
<p>南市的軍警現在奉令負荷着死守的責任。這使命不消說是無上光榮的。願他們加倍的努力。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>倫敦秦晤士報社論。謂德意兩國。皆恐日本戰至筋疲力盡。又恐中國因戰事而紛擾。致共產主義乘機優入。這種推論。深中肯綮。日本若戰至筋疲力盡。失去遠東牽制能力確於德意因戰事而紛擾。共產主義必定侵入。我國本來不贊成共產。並且反對共產。剿減共產。但是到了現在。敵人專門替中國造成共產國家。飛機到處轟炸。名城大邑。盡為灰燼。工商失業。士民流離。已增加了我們仇敵的心理。造成我共產人民的資格。則國家安得而不為共產的國家。敵人欲佔領我偌大的土地。想安居樂業。非法統治。恐是夢想。故日德意三國之反儿協定。與其說是反共協定。不若說是造共協定較為切當。</p>

<h3>比京會議與我外交必勝之點</h3>
<p>— 吳本中</p>
<p>國人對比京會議，十分關切，然大都悲觀者多，而樂觀者少。</p>
<p>若以目前情况觀察，此次本九國公約而招集之國際會議，固難給我國以“立刻滿意”。其理至明；暴日非“力”不服。“力”固有經濟力與軍力之別；然僅有前者血無後者為之後盾，則在現時東亞大勢及國際情形之下，非特難有眞效，且有實想。倘非意外事變，特別嚴市，主持此次會議之英美等國，暫時絕不思輕動干戈，日亦無此預備·旣乏武力，復少裁制，乃唱“誠和”之曲，希望日本放下屠刀，立即成佛：夫豈易易，此比京會議之所以極難給吾國以“現時”“實際”之圓滿勝利也。</p>
<p>然茍能臨觀令昔，遠瞻未來，認此次國際會議，為吾人抗戰外交奪門中之一重要階段，而非最終關口；不枸拘於一時滿意；須放大眼光，佈置外交陣綫，再接再厲作將來之全勝；則此次比京會議，對吾國實有極重大意義，亦有能獲必勝之點；殊當特別注意！</p>
<p>㊀霍爾爵士（Sir　Samuer　Ｈoare）於一年前，當其為英外相時，默察日本在遠東舉動，頗深態慮；曾向其同僚曰：“威脅吾儕者，已非黃鍋，乃“撒夫郎色禍”。卽待燃燒之硫磺顏色；“吾儕會因近東問題，引火入藥庫，所以有歐洲大戰；吾信今之遠東問題，能使世界有更大之火災。”“不過！可惜之至！救火夫等竟意志不一，不知接洽，互相合作！”誠然，溯自九國公約訂立以來，已將十五載之久，而“救火隊”——卽美英法荷等——每遇“大險，”始終意見齟齬，袖手旁觀，以致有今日之嚴重情形。能有切實合作，形成有力“救火陣綫”之徵𧰼者，實當自此次之比京會議始。其降臨期　感稍晚，然其趨勢有利吾國，則不可否認。吾人固深知或有欲“乘火打刦”者，雜此隊中；然吾人更喜有一新救火勇將——俄——加入。故我國外交大策，絕當握緊此次會議機會，施用外交手腕，非將此遠東“救火陣綫”具體實現，堅固築成不可！！！此其意義深遠，及與我民族前途關係之大，吾人無暇於此伸論；我同胞亦可意會及之。</p>

<h3>拒絕和平</h3>
<p>— 林劍星</p>
<p>我們的領導者—蔣委員長，在南京曾對法國記者說過；“我國此次抗戰，匪僅為一己刋害而戰，抑目為全世界正義而戰，藥府九國公約巴黎非戰公約，若果聽任日本予以撕毀，則世界和平基礎，必定發生動搖，吾人必當賡續奪鬥，非至公理完全勝利不止．”這完全宣示了我們抗戰的立場。</p>
<p>敵人𠪖次的侵略，終是運用着且戰且和的手段，過去我們失去許多國土或主權，差不多都中了他這種的詭計，一面進行着軍事行動，一面又做着和平交涉，以政治分化來帮助軍事侵佔，結果，我們只有眼睜睜的看着他被宰割，蘆溝僑事變之初，他們又把這齣拿手好戲演出來了，果然宋哲光又上了他們的老當，而把平津丟了。</p>
<p>自從全面抗戰開始以來，我全國人民除了極少數人苟且偷安的還希冀着惓戀着和平以外，大多數都跟着政府抱定了抗战的决心，我們决不厭戰，雖戰事延長至十年以至—年，不過我們的不厭戰，决不是“好戰”因為我們的戰，是為公理為正義，為世界永久的和平，與侵略國黷武主義的軍閥完全不同。</p>
<p>近幾天聽説敵人在滬亟願休戰，同時有許多漢奸，暗中自華北來到上海活動和平。提起了“和平”多好聽的辭兒，誰不期望和平，况且我們中華民族是最酷愛和平的，惟其酷愛和平，也不惜屢次上大家的當，這和平的呼聲，不竟又使我疑惑敵人又在運用他那一貫的老把戲了，乾脆的說一句，我們這一次是再不會上鈎的了。</p>
<p>蔣委員長也曾說過：“抗戰旣經發動，決不中途妥洽．”敵人要和平固然可以，不過我們不要假的和平，一時一地的和平，而要眞的和平，與全世界永久的和平。</p>
<p>我們有一塊領土被敵人佔據着，以至一寸一分的領土被敵人佔據着，我們有一些的主權，落在敵人的掌握中，我們不談和平，我們要抗戰到底，“抗戰是和平的母親，惟有抗戰才能産生眞實的和平，全世界永久的和平。</p>
<p>“主和者就是漢奸，”這是我們舉行保衛大上海運動時的標語。我們不是絕對拒絕敵人的知平，因為我們不能再上敵人的圈套，所以我們需要的和平，必須建築在“領土與主權的獨立與完整”的原則上。</p>
<p>我們有一寸一分的領土，在敵人的鐵蹄下，我們的主權有一些落在敵人的掌握中，這就不算獨立與完整，我們就决不和敵人談和平。</p>

<h3>Our Left Flank Remains Steadfast, Right Flank Defense Line Moves to New Position</h3>
<p>Elite troops are ordered to defend Nanshi to the death. Enemy troops in Shihudang are surrounded by our forces. Fierce fighting occurs outside Songjiang South Gate.</p>
<p>Following the westward movement of our forces in Shanghai West, it is learned that our left flank defense line, stretching from Liuhe through Shixianggong Temple, Guangfu, Xiaonanxiang, all the way to Yaojiadu on the northern bank of the Suzhou Creek, has remained entirely unaffected and steadfast. The new defense line south of Suzhou Creek starts from a point on the Nanhua Highway along the riverbank, extends south through Hongqiao Airport to Qibao Town (approximately eight kilometers west of the International Settlement), then turns east, following the Caohejing Highway to Longhua (approximately seven kilometers south of the Suzhou Creek). In the Nanshi area, capable troops from a certain division, along with the city's police force, will undertake the isolated defense to the death. Thus, the Battle of Shanghai, which has been raging for nearly three months, continues. A military spokesperson for our forces, in a statement to reporters regarding the movement of our defense line, said, "Since the enemy launched hostilities on August 13th, our loyal and brave soldiers have fought fiercely with the enemy's intense artillery fire, using their flesh and blood. For three months, we have been contesting every village and stronghold with the enemy in this small area, inflicting significant casualties. Their heroic and valiant spirit has astonished and impressed the world. The war is still ongoing within the Shanghai area, far from our army's predetermined national defense line for a final, decisive battle with the enemy. With such great achievements, the current situation should not be considered a military failure. Even if our forces move back further in the future, retreating to the national defense line for a decisive battle with the enemy, we can be even more confident that our army will secure the ultimate victory in a protracted war. Therefore, the future of the war of resistance is extremely promising. The people of the entire country should maintain a steadfast and unwavering will, and persevere to the end with the enemy."</p>
<p>Mayor Yu Hongjun of this city stated to reporters yesterday, "Although our forces have been ordered to retreat to a new defense line, they continue to hold Nanshi, Pudong, and areas such as Pusong and Caohejing, to defend our national territory. Since August 13th, the enemy, under the pretext of the so-called Hongqiao Incident, has dispatched a large army to Shanghai, attempting to fulfill their ambition of aggression. For the sake of self-defense, we had no choice but to rise up and resist. Unfortunately, Shanghai has suffered the devastation of war. Although the enemy possesses advanced weapons, we fight for justice. Therefore, the military and civilians have cooperated, and the soldiers have fought bravely. For three months, we have repeatedly inflicted significant blows on the enemy. Even for every inch of advance or retreat, they must pay a considerable price. After Jiangwan and Zhabei successively fell into enemy hands, we have held steadfastly to the western district for more than two weeks. Now that we have voluntarily withdrawn from the western district, we continue to firmly defend Nanshi. Although Nanshi is not a strategic military location, having received orders from the highest military authority, we can only supervise the police and assist the national army to resist to the death, so that the residents within the area can evacuate calmly to avoid being massacred by the enemy. Preserving one person is to strengthen our war of resistance by one point. Should Nanshi unfortunately fall one day, leading to the loss of the entire city, the spirit of the people of Shanghai will endure forever. As for myself, I can only follow the orders of the central government and strive for the country."</p>
<h3>After Our Army Recaptured Songyin and Other Places, They Pursued the Victory and Advanced, Surrounding the Remnants of the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Enemy Attacking Shihudang Was Also Cut Off by Our Army</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th - The enemy, who had successively occupied Caohejing, Tinglin, Zhangyan, Songyin, Xincang, and Ganxiang, has increased from four or five hundred men to approximately four thousand men. They advanced on Songjiang in two routes, using intense artillery fire to pressure our forces in Pinghu and Songjiang. The situation was tense for a time on the 7th. Later, our fresh troops arrived and dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. Unable to withstand the attack, the enemy collapsed and retreated along the Jinisiniang Bridge and Jinshanwei routes. Our army immediately recovered Songyin, Tinglin, Qianxiang, and Taiping Bridge, and pursued the victory and advanced, surrounding and mopping up the enemy. By the morning of the 8th, over half of the surrounded enemy had been annihilated. Our army is still in the process of encirclement and suppression. On the morning of the 8th, due to clear weather, enemy aircraft were active again, covering the enemy's attempt to break through.</p>
<p>Approximately several hundred enemies, entrenched in the Mishidu area upstream of the Pujiang River, secretly crossed the river at the narrowest point of the Chuanlai Temple riverbank the night before last, landed, and reached Zhangjia Village, six or seven li outside Songjiang South Gate, attempting to harass Shihudang. We have heavy troops stationed there. Although the enemy was stubborn, they ultimately could not succeed. However, the night before last, our army fought fiercely against the enemy near Zhangjia Village, and the sounds of gunfire and artillery could be heard clearly within Songjiang City. There was a great sense of alarm, with everyone being on edge. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers fiercely resisted, killing over a hundred enemies. The enemy's momentum was greatly reduced, and the area was slightly calmer yesterday morning. Our army has gained an absolute advantage, and the people's morale has been greatly boosted.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Fled to Shihudang, and We Surrounded and Vigorously Suppressed Them</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Military Correspondent's report at 12:00 AM on the 9th - A portion of the enemy troops who landed at Jinshanwei and fled to Shihudang and Zhangzhuang City were met by our large army and had their retreat route cut off at around 4:00 PM. The enemy fell into a major encirclement by our forces. Although the enemy stubbornly launched attacks, they were vigorously suppressed by us, and over two hundred enemies were annihilated, over twenty were captured, and many firearms were seized.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Invaded Fengxian, and We Pursued and Attacked Them Separately</h3>
<p>After landing at Caohejing and Jinisiniang Temple, the enemy invaded Tinglin and Jiangzhuang in Fengxian. Later, they attacked Yexie to the west and Shengzhimiao to the east. Our army fought bravely at Xiaozhoujia Tomb, killing many enemies. On the evening of the 7th, it was suddenly reported that the enemy had also landed on the beaches of Zhalin and Qianjiaqiao. In the middle of the night, a fire suddenly broke out in Nanqiao. There were also reports that the enemy on the beaches of Zhalin and Qianjiaqiao was heading straight for Xinxishi, Qingcun, and Fengcheng. Therefore, administrative organs such as the county government and various bureaus had no choice but to retreat to safe areas. Currently, our army is resisting. At the same time, the local militia and special operations teams are also pursuing and attacking them separately at key locations, and their momentum is quite fierce.</p>
<h3>Our Brave Soldiers Vow to Defend Nanshi</h3>
<p>Facing the Enemy Across the River at Rihui Port, the Fortifications Are Strong, and We Will Resist to the End</p>
<p>Central News Agency - Our forces on the south bank of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai West have made a necessary strategic shift to adjust their positions for further combat. However, the highest authorities have ordered a firm defense, and the soldiers ordered to defend Nanshi are also determined to fight the enemy to the death. At the same time, there are no changes in Pudong. Therefore, the Battle of Shanghai, which has lasted for eighty-eight days of bloody fighting, has not only not ended, but has also created a more favorable situation for a long-term war of resistance. This is something that all compatriots in the country should deeply understand. When our army in Zhabei retreated and defended the south bank of Suzhou Creek on the 26th of last month, our loyal and brave soldiers fought bitterly with the enemy, relying on crude fortifications, for two weeks, and their morale was strong and their heroism was extraordinary. They inflicted great damage on the enemy forces who crossed the river to attack. However, the enemy's land and air forces concentrated intense artillery fire and continued bombing, causing much damage to our defense works. At the same time, the enemy who landed at Jinshanwei concentrated their forces and advanced, fiercely attacking Songjiang, causing our forces in Shanghai West to feel threatened and forced to make a strategic move. Before 1:30 AM yesterday, the two armies facing each other across Zhujia Creek were still engaged in fierce fighting. However, under the cover of fierce fighting on the front line, our main forces made an orderly withdrawal. At around 2:00 AM, our army first abandoned the strongholds of Toyota Textile Factory and Zhoujiaqiao and retreated to the line along Guanghua University West, extending east and west through Duzhai and Nanmagou Bridge in Beixinjing. At around 3:00 AM, the Zhujia Creek line also moved south along Bias Road. At around 5:00 AM, after fierce fighting near Lujiazhai on the north bank, the enemy's advance guard of over two hundred men was completely surrounded and annihilated, and our army completely retreated to the new defense line along Qibao and vowed to defend it to the death. At the same time, in Nanshi, the authorities ordered Police Chief Cai Jinjun to lead the city's police force and capable troops from a certain division to defend it to the death and never give up. The morale of our army is high and undiminished. They are now on high alert, vowing to fight the violent enemy to the end.</p>
<h3>The Defense of Nanshi is Consolidated</h3>
<p>Our army has been ordered, and the troops holding Nanshi are on high alert. Their main defense line runs along Rihui Port from the southern border of the French Concession to the Huangpu River. All bridges have been destroyed, and their fortifications are exceptionally strong. At noon yesterday, our outpost was still in the Jinyi Road area of Xujiahui. When the enemy detoured through Shanghai West from the south bank of Suzhou Creek to attack us, they came into contact with our small outpost. Although the enemy had three hundred infantry, five tanks, and eight small cannons, they were intercepted by our army and suffered heavy losses before retreating east. At 4:00 PM, the enemy advanced to the west bank of Rihui Port and confronted us. In the evening, the enemy began constructing fortifications in the areas of Shishanwan, Jinyi Road, Fenglin Bridge, and Xietu Road. As for the area along the Huangpu River, there were no signs of the enemy. Our military police and security forces have demarcated defense zones, are cooperating closely, and are on high alert to deal with the enemy.</p>
<h3>The Enemy is Building Fortifications West of Rihui Port</h3>
<p>Also, this morning at 3:00 AM, this newspaper received a final report that the enemy forces on the west bank of Rihui Port were still building fortifications between Longhua Road, Damu Bridge, and Xiaomu Bridge at night. Their vanguard troops were in the residential houses of Zhangjiazhai near the area, about 700 to 1,000 meters from the bank of Rihui Port. Our army is firmly defending the area from the east bank of Rihui Port to the Huangpu River. The order in Nanshi is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>The Concession Authorities are Strengthening Defenses</h3>
<p>In view of the tense situation yesterday (the 9th), the French army and police authorities stationed in the French Concession in Shanghai strengthened defenses in the areas along Rihui Port and Xujiahui in the afternoon. Multiple armored vehicles and small cannons were deployed and stationed at iron gates in various riverbank locations to maintain the safety of the concession.</p>
<p>According to residents who escaped from Fenglin Bridge yesterday morning, the enemy forces reached Laolonghua in the afternoon. Japanese flags were raised on the Longhua Pagoda and the tallest buildings in the town. At 2:00 PM, the enemy forces reached Xiexu Road. The French Concession authorities dispatched a small squad of about twenty French army soldiers to be stationed near the Dapu Road Bridge to prevent any eventuality.</p>
<h3>Director Cai Talks About Fighting to the End</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Police Chief Cai Jinjun has been ordered to defend Nanshi and has supervised his subordinates to resist desperately, determined to protect this last piece of land in Songhu and coexist with the entire Shanghai. According to reporters, the adjustment of our army's defense line and its westward withdrawal has no impact on the defense of Nanshi. The current defense of Nanshi is exceptionally solid, and the various rumors are absolutely inaccurate. Although the police force is relatively weak, it is our duty to protect the people and defend the territory. Since the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the entire bureau has mobilized, and in addition to working hard to maintain public order and relieve refugees, it has also cooperated with the national army in battles in the city center, repeatedly establishing glorious achievements. Now, due to strategic considerations, the national army has temporarily moved west. It is the duty of this bureau to follow the instructions of the leader and the government and, following the national army, to firmly defend Nanshi. Even if there is only one gun and one bullet left, we will fight to the end and never allow the enemy to completely occupy Shanghai, so as to win dignity for the country and glory for the nation.

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombed Nanshi All Day, and it Suffered a Tragic Fire</h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Refugees Fled in Panic, Crying and Shouting, a Heartbreaking Sight</p>
<p>Central News Agency - Yesterday (the 9th), starting at dawn, enemy aircraft flew to the skies over Nanshi and Pudong. Each time, there were at least one or two aircraft, and at most five or six aircraft, taking turns coming and going, circling and spying. Until 3:30 PM, twelve enemy aircraft, divided into five batches, with three aircraft in the first two batches and two aircraft in the last three batches, successively flew to the skies over Nanshi and Pudong and bombed indiscriminately. Over twenty bombs were dropped in the Yangjiadu and Zhangjiabang areas of Pudong, and the damage is unknown. As many as twenty-two bombs were dropped near the Gaochang Temple and Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi. Fires broke out where the bombs landed, and the burning was quite intense. The fires had not been extinguished by night. Two bombs were dropped at the Manufacturing Bureau Road Bethel Hospital, landing in open areas with no damage. Two bombs were dropped near the South Railway Station, and a section of the tracks was destroyed.</p>
<h3>Guanghua University Was Burned Down by the Enemy</h3>
<p>National News Agency - After our garrison on the south bank of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai West withdrew yesterday morning due to strategic considerations, enemy forces advanced to Fenglin Bridge and Guanghua University on Daxilu. The university has been burned down by the enemy, which is a consistent tactic of destroying our cultural institutions.</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency - At the end of Zhongshan Road and in the Hualun Road area in Shanghai West, fires suddenly broke out from the bombings, raging fiercely, with black smoke rising into the sky. It is reported that most of the houses and factories in the area have been destroyed, and the losses are enormous.</p>
<h3>Civilian Houses in Nanshi Burned Fiercely</h3>
<p>Yesterday, multiple enemy planes in Nanshi dropped incendiary bombs in the Outer Rihui Bridge area and Xietu Road area starting at 8:00 in the morning. There were mostly straw sheds in the area, so a large fire broke out and continued to burn until the afternoon. All the small factories and thatched houses in the area were reduced to ashes. Residents of Nanshi flocked to the concessions, and the Fangbang Bridge area was blocked. Another group of refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, fled to the City God Temple in the refugee area inside the city, and their situation was extremely miserable.</p>
<p>Also, at around 2:00 PM, a fire broke out at the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Station, and the flames soared high into the sky, making it impossible to approach. The intensity of the fire could be seen even from the rooftops of the concessions.</p>
<p>Also, at around 3:00 PM, two teams of six enemy planes circled over the skies over Xiexu Road and Jumen Road in Shanghai West, taking turns dropping bombs. Fires broke out in multiple locations, and the flames soared into the sky, burning for a long time.</p>
<h3>Swimming to Escape Under the Fire</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 5:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the Dapu Road area in Shanghai West. The fire was raging fiercely in the area south of the Chinese Pencil Factory west of Rihui Port (that is, Xiexu Road Bridge). The burned area included the entire Shanghai Galoshes Factory and civilian houses and thatched sheds, totaling over a hundred and ten buildings. The French Concession fire engines arrived after being alerted, but they were blocked by the riverbank and could not carry out rescue work on the north bank of the river. Residents swimming across the river were extremely crowded. Until 2:00 PM, the fire was very intense, causing the Xiexu Road Bridge in front of the New National Pulp Printing Company to burn. According to refugees who escaped from the area, there were a total of four or five fires, so many factories east and west of Dapu Road were affected. The burned area was very large. Although the fire had subsided slightly by 3:00 PM, it had not been completely extinguished.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of Refugees Crying and Shouting</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the situation in the four suburbs of Shanghai became even more tense. Refugees from the southwestern areas of Shanghai, such as Longhua, Caohejing, and Rihui Port, were carrying the old and leading the young, walking along the ports, with as many as forty to fifty thousand people. They were planning to enter the French Concession, but the French Concession area along Rihui Port was blocked by barbed wire. Even if there were ferries, they could not pass, causing a complete blockage outside the iron gates in various places, with loud cries and shouts, and the situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Charity Organizations Dispatched Vehicles to Rescue</h3>
<p>New News Agency - After our army moved back to defend the new defense line, the residents of the four rural areas of Shanghai were fleeing to Shanghai with the old and the young because they could not bear to be brutally massacred by the enemy. They gathered on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, and the situation was very miserable. Upon hearing the report, the local charity organizations dispatched a large number of ambulances to rescue them. They returned to Shanghai in the evening and rescued about 400 refugees, who were sent to the organization's shelter in the Nanshi refugee area for resettlement. According to a rescue worker, enemy planes were circling over the areas where the refugees were gathering and strafing them with machine guns. When members of the organization ventured to rescue them, about dozens of refugees were unfortunately massacred.</p>
<h3>Do Not Waver in Belief, Pan Gongzhan</h3>
<p>Protecting Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>When our troops withdrew from Jiangwan and Zhabei, I advised the citizens not to regard it as abandoning Shanghai. Now that our troops are making a strategic withdrawal from western Shanghai again, I still want to loudly advise the citizens not to regard it as abandoning Shanghai. Regardless of whether our military and police are still ordered to hold Nanshi and will coexist with the position, even if one day we also reluctantly withdraw due to terrain and strategic reasons, we must not think that we are willing to abandon Shanghai. In short, "Protecting Greater Shanghai" is the expectation of all our people and the belief of all our people. No matter how the military situation changes, this belief must be firmly established and unshakable.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say, what is the use of having this belief without power? Little do they know that belief is the function of the spirit, and with belief, power can be generated. If we want to have the power to "Protect Greater Shanghai", we must first have the confidence to "Protect Greater Shanghai". If confidence first shakes itself, what else can we talk about power? First, we must be truly aware of the responsibility of the War of Resistance and not solely blame the army. The task of "Protecting Greater Shanghai" must be resolutely undertaken by all the citizens of the city. If the citizens of Shanghai, everyone, sees danger and gives up their lives, and is mentally united with the spirit of not seeking exemption from difficulties, and can truly contribute money if they have money, and contribute strength if they have strength, and cannot be subdued by power, cannot be corrupted by wealth, and cannot be moved by poverty and humility, and continue to move forward without turning back despite all setbacks, I think that with the status of Greater Shanghai and the financial resources of Greater Shanghai, it can make a great contribution to protecting the whole country, let alone just protecting a city of Shanghai. If our beliefs are shaken because of the temporary withdrawal of the army, and we think that Greater Shanghai is finished from now on and cannot be protected, it is tantamount to admitting that the War of Resistance is only a matter for the army, and what words can we use to explain the "All-People War of Resistance"?</p>
<p>Secondly, we must clearly recognize that the Songhu War of Resistance in the past three months is really only the beginning of a full-scale war of resistance and a protracted war of resistance. Although our troops have successively withdrawn from Jiangwan, Zhabei, and western Shanghai, during the three months of bloody resistance, countless materials have been consumed by the enemy, and countless combat power of the enemy has been weakened. In the sense of a full-scale war of resistance, it is still a victory. Moreover, in terms of the situation of the battlefield, on the one hand, we are still guarding Nanshi, and on the other hand, the large army position between Jiading and Nanxiang is still unusually stable. Today, we retreat for strategic reasons. How can we know that in the future we will not advance for strategic reasons? As long as our patriotic citizens and our loyal and brave soldiers are always connected in spirit, helping each other, and encouraging each other, then the retreating position at present will one day be recovered. In other words, "Protecting Greater Shanghai" will eventually be able to complete its task. At this time of military panic and fluctuating hearts, we especially need to grasp our beliefs, not let the traitors be active, not let the puppets show their faces, and use our spirit of unity, arouse our perseverance to never turn back, and build the upper city of "Protecting Greater Shanghai".</p>

<h3>Our Country Vows to Resist to the End Until Territorial Sovereignty is Recognized</h3>
<p>Japan's Strength Consumption is Not What Germany and Italy Want. The Restoration of Peace in the Far East is a Concern for All Powers. The London Times' Commentary is Insightful</p>
<p>[London] The Times today carried an editorial, saying that Italy's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact is only a reaffirmation of Italy's abhorrence and fear of communism. Although some commentators have tried to make the neighboring countries of the three countries feel frightened, it is currently more appropriate to accept it at its face value. At the same time, the Brussels Conference focuses on being pragmatic, and its letter of application to Japan is worded tactfully, so that if Japan accepts it, it can show its willingness to discuss the peace with the powers. Germany and Italy are both deeply concerned about the restoration of peace in China. Both countries are afraid that Japan will be exhausted by the war, and that China will be troubled by the war, so that communism will take the opportunity to invade. The newspaper believes that China is determined not to stop the war until it achieves its goals, or is sure that there is no hope of achieving its goals. If China has the ability to continue the War of Resistance for one day, its government cannot negotiate peace with Japan for one day, and listen to Japan's control of a large part of China's land. China's death battle with the aggressor this time is very brave. Now although it is gradually feeling difficult, the whole country's determination to resist the war is extremely enthusiastic. A solution that is not based on the recognition of China's rights will only prolong the war and will not establish peace. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Far East Conference Suddenly Changed, and Litvinov Left Brussels in Anger</h3>
<p>Extremely Annoyed at Being Excluded from the Committee. Non-Public Meeting Postponed to Today.</p>
<p>⊙Brussels The Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, who attended the Nine-Power Conference, is scheduled to leave for Moscow tonight. It is heard that this development is due to Litvinov's dissatisfaction with the attempt to exclude the Soviet Union from the about-to-be-established mediation committee or the steering committee. Italy, which recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, now has the possibility of participating in the steering committee and the mediation committee or any of them, which is also what the Soviet Union is dissatisfied with. Because although the Soviet Union is not a signatory country to the Nine-Power Pact, its borders are adjacent to China and Japan, and it is a country that is more related to the Far East than Italy. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Bodankin is still staying in Brussels, but the withdrawal of the entire Soviet delegation is what Italy wants. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels The non-public meeting of the Nine-Power Pact Conference, which was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon, has now been postponed to 3:00 PM tomorrow. Also, the chief representative of France at the Nine-Power Pact Conference, that is, Foreign Minister Delbos, is scheduled to arrive here by car from Paris at 8:15 tonight. British Foreign Secretary Eden can fly here at 1:54 this afternoon. (Central News Agency, Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] After returning to the country, British Foreign Secretary Eden originally intended to stay in London and no longer participate in the Nine-Power Pact Conference. Now, he suddenly set off for Brussels this morning, which is unexpected. British semi-official sources generally say that the Nine-Power Pact Conference may see great developments, and the foreign secretary must go in person. After the foreign secretary arrives, the chairman of the conference, that is, former Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, will meet with him to exchange views on the progress of the conference. (Central News Agency, Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels The chief representative of the United States, Davis, had frequent contacts with representatives of various countries today. At noon, he had lunch with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. After the meal, he held talks with the British acting chief representative, that is, the British Dominion Minister MacDonald. He then went to the Belgian Foreign Ministry to have talks with members of the Belgian delegation. (Central News Agency, Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels The representatives of the countries at the Nine-Power Pact Conference all hope today that Japan's reply to the Belgian government will be worded subtly, so that the future mediation struggle will continue to be open, and at the same time, it will take the opportunity to carry out its military operations to achieve its goals. Some diplomats believe that Japan may cooperate with the small committee designated by the Nine-Power Pact Conference if there is no Soviet Russia in it, in order to solve the Far Eastern situation. However, another part of diplomats have doubts about what kind of basis to conduct mediation. (9th, National News)</p>
<h3>We Are Determined to Reject Mediation Outside the Conference and Deny Direct Negotiations</h3>
<p>⊙The Chinese delegation in Brussels announced today that the Chinese government is bound to reject the mediation of any third country that is not at the conference, and insists that Sino-Japanese negotiations can only obtain a satisfactory solution on the basis of the Nine-Power Pact. (8th, Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin The Chinese Embassy in Germany announced this morning that it had received a message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denying that China and Japan were conducting direct negotiations to stop the Far Eastern conflict, and pointed out that no other mediation had been carried out except for the Brussels Conference. (8th, Haitong)</p>
<h3>England and America Plan Political Demonstration; Germany Said to Be Appointed as Mediator Is Still Prevailing</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The semi-official German News Agency recently released a message stating that the United States and the United Kingdom, along with the Soviet Union, are now planning to use the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to hold a political demonstration against the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Italy, Germany, and Japan on November 6. British Foreign Secretary Eden has returned to Brussels from London with a draft of his speech, preparing to deliver it at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. This speech will first be agreed upon with the American representative. It is also said that the matters discussed by the US Chief Delegate Davis and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov during their talks in Brussels yesterday concerned this issue as well. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the matter of Germany mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, rumors are still rife. Political figures here are quite surprised by this and say that this claim has been denied by both the Chinese and Japanese governments and is not credible. However, the fact that there are such rumors suggests that Germany holds a quite important position among the major powers. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan May Participate; Final Decision at Friday's Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>⊙Brussels A statement issued by sources very close to the Japanese Embassy in Brussels indicates that Japan may participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It is said that Japan, in order to fulfill the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, has been conducting full and frank discussions with representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in Tokyo. The statement also claimed that the current conference is authorized by the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union is participating, even though it is not a signatory to the treaty. Therefore, if Japan is willing to send a representative to participate in the conference, it would be an important indication of Japan's spirit of mediation and a genuine concession. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota stated at today's cabinet meeting that the invitation for Japan to attend the Brussels conference and cooperate in resolving the Sino-Japanese conflict requires considerable time for consideration and can only be decided at the next cabinet meeting on the 12th. (Haitong Electric, 9th)</p>
<h3>US Public Opinion's Observation: Difficult to Achieve Results from the Conference</h3>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the current international situation, American public opinion is generally concerned about the complex and intricate global diplomatic situation, as can be seen in newspaper commentaries and private conversations. The general consensus here is that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be very difficult to achieve any results. The terms of the Anti-Comintern Pact among Italy, Germany, and Japan that have been disclosed are not of great danger, but the new alliance formed by these countries has established a foundation in world politics. Its scope of activities is almost unlimited because these countries can use the pretext of eliminating communism and use various excuses to act independently or jointly anywhere in the world. It is generally believed that Italy, Germany, and Japan will try to persuade European countries to join the Anti-Comintern Pact and that efforts will also be made to attract countries in the Americas. If this happens, the unified ideological situation in the Americas will be threatened, and the united front formed by the Pan-American Conference last year (to prevent countries outside the Americas from interfering in American affairs) will be at risk of being destroyed. Regarding the current situation in the Far East, President Roosevelt originally had the possibility of making further statements after his speech in Chicago on October 6, but it is feared that American public opinion will revert to conservatism. The establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Italy, Germany, and Japan may accelerate its return to isolationism. Now that the US Congress is about to reconvene, President Roosevelt is hesitant to make any statements. (Zhong Shi She, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>General Chiang Pai-li Meets Italian Representative</h3>
<p>Bishop Yu Pin Visits Belgian King</p>
<p>⊙Brussels General Chiang Pai-li and Bishop Yu Pin visited the Italian representative Adolfo Venturi yesterday and held lengthy talks. General Chiang is scheduled to return to Berlin tonight and will go to Rome to meet Chen Gongbo, planning to stay in Rome for about ten days. Chiang has also agreed to write an article for a German official military newspaper on China's resistance and future victory. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels Bishop Yu Pin will broadcast a speech here tonight, detailing the general development of China and the close cooperation between the church and the government. After the speech, he will go to the Netherlands, where the Dutch Catholic Church has prepared a welcome. It is said that Bishop Yu will broadcast speeches to the Dutch public about the actual situation in China and lecture at the Catholic University of the Netherlands. After that, he will return to Brussels and give speeches at the Catholic University of Leuven, the University of Liège, and the university professors' conference. Then, on the 16th, he will go to Rome, and on the 26th, he will go to Switzerland. Regarding his mission to Rome, Bishop Yu said that he had met with the Pope several times in Rome. The Pope has not only donated 85,000 lire to aid Chinese refugees but has now donated another 100,000 lire. The Pope's attitude towards China is the same as announced in 1928, expressing deep sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people in the current events. Bishop Yu's visit to Belgium has had a significant impact on the Belgian Catholic newspapers. For example, Belgium's largest Catholic newspaper reprinted an article by former Italian Finance Minister Stefani on the organization of the Chinese army, which was very favorable in its criticism of our country. King Leopold II of Belgium received Bishop Yu Pin today and inquired in detail about the situation in China. The King stated that any peace that is not based on justice cannot be established. Since the King is about to visit King George VI of England, Bishop Yu requested that the King explain the current situation in China in detail when meeting with the monarchs of various countries.

<h3>Italy Joins Anti-Comintern Pact; Soviet Union Protests to Italy</h3>
<p>Believes It Violates Treaty of Friendship; Relationship Between the Two Countries Hangs by a Thread</p>
<p>[Rome] The Soviet Union has formally protested against Italy's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact of the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador has informed Italian Foreign Minister Ciano that the Soviet Union considers Italy's participation in the agreement an "unfriendly act." The Soviet Union also accused the Italian government of violating the Treaty of Friendship signed between the Soviet Union and Italy in 1933. When the Soviet Ambassador visited the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday, the Foreign Minister stated that the purpose of the agreement was to oppose the Third International and not to oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is no reason for the Soviet Union to oppose it. The Ambassador then reported the Italian Foreign Minister's views to his government, and after receiving instructions from his government, he formally protested to the Italian government. Furthermore, the Polish Ambassador also visited the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday to discuss the agreement, but denied that they had discussed Poland's accession to the pact. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Political figures believe that Ciano will refuse to accept the Soviet Union's protest, arguing that the Anti-Comintern Pact does not oppose any country and welcomes all countries to join freely. (Haitong Electric, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] This morning's newspapers commented on the Soviet Union's protest to Italy and the recent tensions between Italy and the Soviet Union. The newspapers unanimously believed that it would not be surprising if the Soviet Union and Italy severed diplomatic relations. (Haitong Electric, 9th)</p>
<h3>German-Italian Axis Expands into a Triangular Alliance</h3>
<p>Germany Is No Longer Isolated; Hitler Is Satisfied; Said That Japan Will Grant Economic Benefits to Germany and Italy</p>
<p>⊙Munich Today is the anniversary of the Nazi Party's uprising here in 1923. Führer Hitler personally came here to preside over the celebration and gave a speech, saying, "Today's Germany is no longer isolated. Many other countries that do not agree with the ideals of the League of Nations have formed alliances with us. The Anti-Comintern Pact recently concluded by Italy, Germany, and Japan is based on this spirit. The political axis between Germany and Italy was originally limited to Europe, but now it has been extended and has become a large triangle in international politics. The three countries, Italy, Germany, and Japan, that form this triangle have decided to safeguard their own rights and interests related to their survival." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] According to reports from Rome, the Japanese government has allowed Germany and Italy to enjoy economic benefits in the Chinese territories occupied by Japan. If this is confirmed, officials must conduct an investigation because if Germany, Italy, and Japan have indeed concluded this economic agreement, it would greatly contradict the principle of the Open Door Policy in China. However, so far, it has not been possible to confirm the existence of an economic agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan regarding China. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>⊙Prague Regarding the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Italy, Germany, and Japan, the Czech Daily recently commented, "Although this agreement superficially opposes the Soviet Union, it actually opposes Britain, the United States, and France. Geographically, the Soviet Union does not feel threatened. On the contrary, the naval bases of Britain in Singapore, France in Vietnam, and the United States in the Pacific are all threatened by Japan. In addition, Egypt is threatened by Italy, and London and Paris are threatened by Germany. In the future, Italy, Germany, and Japan can accuse certain democratic countries of participating in the 'destructive actions of the Third International' and interfere in their internal affairs. From this perspective, the Anti-Comintern Pact violates the most important principle of modern international relations, which is that the internal affairs of other countries should not be interfered with."

<p>[London] German Ambassador Ribbentrop flew here from Munich today and will attend the banquet of the new Lord Mayor of London tonight. He will take the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain to explain the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The German Ambassador will likely explain the political value of the Anti-Comintern Pact, believing that it is only an ideological agreement and will not threaten Britain. Furthermore, the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have not signed any treaty stipulating that special commercial concessions in the Chinese territories occupied by Japan will be granted to Germany and Italy. (Havas Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] American public opinion has recently been commenting on the Anti-Comintern Pact between Italy, Germany, and Japan, causing a negative impression among German diplomatic circles. An evening newspaper reported, "The goal of this agreement is not to suppress existing revolutionary movements by force, but to prevent potential revolutionary movements from breaking out. If communism is found within a country, it should be eliminated by that country using its own strength." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

Regarding this matter, the State Department will negotiate with the Japanese government, requesting restrictions. Although Japanese fishing boats are fishing in the high seas near that area, they do not have licenses. Experts at the State Department believe that after the government negotiates with Japan, it may be possible to establish a similar agreement based on the four-nation agreement between the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Canada regarding the restriction of seal hunting along the Arctic Ocean coast.

However, what I can say is that from July 1 to September 30, the total value of British ordnance, bullets, naval and army supplies, etc., shipped to Japan was 14,612 pounds. From this number, it can be seen that the amount of British munitions shipped to Japan has been reduced to a very low level in recent months. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Englishman Mr. Bull Describes the Brutality of the Enemy Troops in North China</h3>
<p>Differences of Opinion Between the Japanese Garrison and the Kwantung Army; The Kwantung Army Is Determined to Cut Off Sino-Soviet Contact</p>
<p>Baoding Becomes a Region of Terror</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports an article written by an Englishman named Bull., stating that recently, due to strict Japanese inspections and traffic disruptions, it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate news from North China. He happened to dine with a foreign student from Peiping (Beijing) who was familiar with current events, and thus learned a little about the recent developments in North China. My friend told me that he has definite evidence that the opinions of the Japanese garrison in North China and the Kwantung Army are very different and they are deeply suspicious of each other. The Japanese garrison in North China seems to have no specific economic or land goals, only holding the vague idea of developing China for the benefit of Japan. The Kwantung Army has a firm goal of cutting off China and the Soviet Union to prevent Soviet influence from extending to China and assisting China through Outer Mongolia. Members of the Kwantung Army have clearly fulfilled their desire to win over several leaders in Inner Mongolia, such as Prince De, who is now serving the Japanese because he resents the treatment he received from the Chinese government in the past. However, many Mongolians are worried because the Japanese demands are very extravagant, and what they get is only an empty name of autonomy. Judging from the experience in Hinggan and other places, all the more intelligent Mongolians feel that what they can hope for under the new government is only a few minor positions, and all the important positions will be occupied by the Japanese. As a result, the Mongolians are merely puppets of the Japanese. It is heard that some Mongolians would rather join Outer Mongolia than be exploited by the Japanese, so my friend believes that the Japanese may encounter serious disputes in that area. As for the North China war situation, the Japanese army suffered significant losses only at Nankou, and there was almost no resistance in other places. The Chinese army could not even blow up bridges and tunnels to cover their retreat, and even if they did damage them, the Japanese army could quickly pass through. The Ping-Sui Railway has a tunnel where the Chinese army tried to block it by blowing up eight locomotives, but experts from the South Manchurian Railway cleared it in two weeks, and the tunnel was reopened. The Japanese army's use of mechanized transportation in various places in western Hebei has been very effective, but it requires a large amount of gasoline and motor equipment. The Japanese army's diet of rice has also made their transportation problem even more difficult. My friend said, "I don't understand why the Chinese army made it so easy for the Japanese army to pass through. Just a few daredevils would be enough to disrupt the Japanese army's communication lines, especially the railway. They should read Lawrence's 'Revolt in the Desert.'" Currently, only Yenching University and Fu Jen Catholic University are open in Peiping. Peking University and Normal University are used as barracks by the Japanese army, and so is part of Tsinghua University's dormitories. The president of Yenching University said that he would rather close the school than have the Japanese interfere in its curriculum. After Baoding was occupied by the Japanese army, there were days of looting. The Japanese army acted like madmen. The week afterwards was almost the most bloody and terrible era in the history of Japan's continental policy. Hundreds and thousands of people were shot. I witnessed hundreds of Japanese soldiers looting, and Japanese officers turned a blind eye. A Japanese officer on horseback robbed an American missionary of a gold watch and a fountain pen, giving him a cheap Japanese watch. The missionary refused to accept it. Another Japanese soldier robbed a beautiful female missionary of a camera. Another soldier wanted to blow up the safe of the American church but was persuaded to stop. Japanese officers ordered the refugees to return to their villages, but many were shot or stabbed by Japanese soldiers on the way. The puppet government established here admitted that the looting was an undisciplined act but said that the Japanese soldiers were angry because they believed that Baoding was an anti-Japanese base. In addition to the American church, which had American flags painted on its roof, being hit by cannons and bombs, the French Catholic Church, which also had French flags hanging and the three characters "Catholic Church" painted one foot square on its roof, was also bombarded by cannons and bombs. This was definitely not accidental. Fortunately, the French and Dutch pastors and nuns in the church were all safe. Last week, Chinese planes came to bomb the city four times, the purpose of which was the Japanese airfield in the east of the city, where fifteen bombers were stationed, bombing the Chinese army's positions. On the morning of October 8, when the Japanese army passed through Baoding again, two armed Japanese soldiers robbed a Chinese doorman of the American church of 20 yuan in legal tender. Also, the benches in the two churches were cut up and used as fuel. All of the above are facts witnessed by a certain foreigner in Baoding.</p>
<h3>Relief for Unemployed Workers</h3>

<h3>Nanshi Refugee Zone Operational, Accepting Refugees Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Red Cross Flags Hung on Rooftops All Around; Municipal Police Armed to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Committee Issues Statement</p>
<p>The Nanshi Refugee Zone Management Committee, represented by Chairman Father Jacquinot and six other foreign members, issued a statement yesterday, stating that the proposal to establish the refugee zone has been agreed upon by both China and Japan. This effort by all three parties is purely motivated by humanitarianism. This measure will not infringe upon Chinese sovereignty. It stipulates that the area of Nanshi city and its suburbs, bounded by Fangbang Road to the south, and the French Concession to the east, west and north, is designated as a safe residence for refugees, not subject to any form of attack, with no armed military units or military organs, and no armed hostile activities. Under Chinese civil administration, the Chinese police will maintain order, with their weapons limited to police-issued Mauser pistols or handguns. The committee enjoys complete access to exercise its supervisory powers within this area. If a situation arises that prevents the committee from continuing its guarantee, the committee will notify the Chinese and Japanese authorities and rescind its promise, and all safety guarantees will be revoked. The committee recognizes that all promises have now been kept and announces that, starting at 5:00 PM on November 9th, this zone is open for refugees to reside in under the agreed conditions.</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, due to the expansion of the war zone and the large number of refugees, which cannot be accommodated within the concessions, requested the municipal authorities to designate an area as a refugee shelter for the war zone, while requesting the Japanese side not to bomb the area. This humanitarian appeal has been approved by our military and political authorities and has been implemented since 12:00 noon yesterday. The area is designated as one-third of the old city, bounded by Fangbang Road to the south, and Min Guo Road to the east, west, and north. All intersections near Min Guo Road have been built with solid fortifications. The intersections where Fangbang Road connects to these streets began to be constructed with defensive fortifications yesterday afternoon. Nanyang Bridge at the west end of Fangbang Road leads to the French Concession, and the east end leads to Xiaodongmen, directly to the Huangpu River. Refugees from Pudong can land there and follow Fangbang Road. The boundaries are clear, and the residents within the boundaries are very calm. Two hundred of our police officers are stationed in the area to maintain order. Red Cross flags have been hung around the area since yesterday afternoon for identification. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, International Relief Committee members Jacquinot (Chairman of the Refugee Relief Group), Barnes, Andrews, Yespai, Pengpu, Madden, and Poland and more than ten others, accompanied by Mao Yun and others representing the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, inspected the area for a week. The situation was quite good, and they were all satisfied. According to what the reporter learned from the Nanshi inspection yesterday, public places in the area, such as the Yimiao, Yuyuan, Xiaoshijie, schools, and churches, have been opened as shelters. As the number of refugees increases, more will be opened in succession. According to the size of the area, it can accommodate 100,000 refugees. Currently, the number of refugees fleeing from Pudong and Husi Hunan has reached about 20,000. Many people in the concessions have also moved back. In addition to the responsible persons who have been dispatched by the various hometown associations to handle the accommodation and relief, the association is now preparing to set up an office, which will start working within days. The urban area south of Fangbang Road is still under the responsibility of our police, maintaining order, and the order is quite good. The number of refugees accommodated yesterday was 1,200 at Xiaoshijie, 400 at the Doumiye Guild, and the Hui Mosque, Chenghuang Temple, Yuyuan, Chenxiang Pavilion, Grain Guild, Flour Exchange, and Pearl and Jade Guild on Fuyou Road Houjia Wharf were all arranged separately. In addition, a Nanhuo store in the middle of Old School Field Street also accommodated many refugees, and they were arranged properly until night. Other refugees will continue to be transported to the area for accommodation today. Red Cross flags are hung on the rooftops all around for identification.</p>

<h3>Pudong Refugees Continuing to Cross the River Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ferries Crowded Along the Bund; Foreign Warships Dispatch Patrol Boats for Protection</p>
<p>A large number of Pudong residents have been moving to the concessions across the Huangpu River for days. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency inspected the Bund yesterday morning. The ferries were crowded from the French Concession Bund to the Jianghai Customs, and traffic continued without interruption, all loaded with a large number of residents. The British and French Concession police authorities dispatched Chinese and Western police officers, together with British soldiers, to maintain order at the docks. British, American, and French warships also dispatched steamships to protect in the river. Relief organizations such as the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association, the Shanghai Relief Branch, and the Red Swastika Society dispatched a large number of trucks to transport and resettle them in the Nanshi Refugee Zone. Those who could not afford to cross the river were also transported by charitable organizations by hired boats. As of noon, more than 5,000 refugees had crossed the river.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society relief team, seeing that the refugees were crowded in Pudong and could not cross the river westward, led a team across the river at 2:00 AM yesterday, rescuing more than 1,000 refugees in various places in Pudong, transporting them to safety in shifts, and sending them to relatives and friends.</p>

<h3>Foreign Warships Intercept Foreign Ships, Foreign Merchants Discussing Countermeasures</h3>
<p>The Italian merchant ship Ende, owned by the Italian Chinese Company, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo the other day. Unexpectedly, it was unreasonably intercepted by an enemy ship on the Tongsha sea, delayed for more than ten hours, and then arrived in Ningbo. After picking up passengers and cargo, it still sailed back to Shanghai on the same day. It returned here at 9:20 AM yesterday. According to the spokesperson of the ship, enemy ships have been frequently intercepting foreign merchant ships outside Wusongkou in recent days, conducting unreasonable inspections and other things, which have had a considerable impact on shipping. Therefore, it is now heard that the foreign authorities have begun to discuss proper countermeasures to maintain business.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Delivery Postponed</h3>

It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has already basically approved the request, as all parties concerned have already reached a proper solution, and it is not necessary to issue a clear announcement. The Brokers' Association of the exchange also does not need to convene a meeting at present. Therefore, the long-delayed issue of public bond delivery on account can come to an end.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Mutual Aid Fees for Rickshaws in the Special Zone</h3>

<h3>Enemy Plunders Steel Bars in the Eastern District of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Thousands of Tons of Steel Bars Stored in Cai Renmao's Warehouse Hauled Away</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Defend Nanshi to the Death</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Our army on the south bank of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai again made a strategically necessary retreat yesterday. However, our highest authorities in Nanshi have ordered Cai Jinjun, the police chief, to lead the city's police and a strong unit of a certain division to defend the city to the death, and never give up. The defensive fortifications in Nanshi, after months of construction, are quite solid. Moreover, the houses are densely packed together, just like in Zhabei, which is also a condition that is easy to defend. If the enemy wants to seize Nanshi and complete the attempt to occupy Shanghai, I am afraid they will have to suffer considerable significant sacrifices and consumption.</p>
<p>Defending Nanshi to the death is like defending Taiyuan to the death. The military significance is still small, but the political significance is great. Because the two cities of Shanghai and Taiyuan are symbols of the enemy's goal of a quick victory. Even if it cannot be defended in the end and must be lost, it is always better to defend it for one more day for the sake of international hearing and domestic morale. This is one reason. Shanghai and Taiyuan occupy important positions in our country's politics and economy. The enemy wants to seize these two major cities in order to control political and economic power. If we adopt a scorched earth resistance strategy, it will be difficult for the enemy to achieve his goals. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Of course, under the current military situation, the act of defending Nanshi to the death is tragic. The number of defenders is limited, and most of them are police. After all, it is a tragedy to resist the attacks of a large number of enemy troops. Moreover, after another defensive battle, the prosperous area of ​​Nanshi will inevitably be turned into ruins. However, we must know that we are fighting for the entire nation. If a local disaster can be exchanged for the glory of the entire nation, this disaster is worthy of eternal praise by later generations.</p>
<p>The military and police in Nanshi are now ordered to bear the responsibility of defending to the death. This mission is undoubtedly supremely glorious. May they make redoubled efforts.</p>

According to Mr. Hader, the YMCA's registration of unemployed female workers and their introduction to factories for work is a practical form of relief, to which the Bureau expresses great sympathy. Currently, the Bureau, considering the rapidly increasing number of refugees, urgently needs to find ways to place them so they can obtain work and support themselves. Therefore, the Bureau is very willing to cooperate with groups with practical work capabilities to establish contact and jointly trial this refugee placement issue. Furthermore, it hopes that the YMCA will advise Chinese factories to resume operations immediately so that refugees can find a way out and industries can increase production. The Bureau will, within its capabilities, make every effort to assist in all matters. Mr. Hader believes that during this time of war, efforts in production will surely develop various industries, and their products can take the opportunity to be transported to various countries for sales. In response, Mr. Zhuang Ping, Chairman of the YMCA, expressed gratitude for the Bureau's concern for refugees. He stated that various factories are prepared to resume operations in safe areas, but finding suitable factory sites is quite difficult. He hoped that the Bureau could provide practical assistance in this regard first. He also expressed appreciation for the Bureau's willingness to cooperate in refugee placement, and assured that the YMCA would do its utmost to meet these expectations, but eagerly hoped that the Bureau would provide guidance at any time so that they could proceed smoothly together. Both parties exchanged opinions and discussed matters for two hours, and were very satisfied with the results. It is reported that the YMCA has scheduled an emergency meeting of merchants from various countries to discuss practical measures in detail with the Industrial Section of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Actively Encouraging the Subscription of National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Lin Bingyan Solely Purchases 150,000 Yuan, Muslim Religious Friends Voluntarily Subscribe</p>
<p>Special District Group. The First Special District Group of the Citizens' National Salvation Bond Solicitation Corps sent a letter to the captains of each team yesterday, stating that the group has been soliciting National Salvation Bonds for nearly two months. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic support of the captains, considerable results have been achieved. As the frontline war becomes increasingly urgent, the rear's solicitation of bonds should also continue to advance. This special letter is to urge the captains to continue their efforts to expand solicitation and to send the solicited amount along with the first copy of the subscription form to the group for reporting to the main corps.</p>
<p>Guangdong Compatriots. The Guangdong branch of the Shanghai Citizens' National Salvation Bond Solicitation Corps has been making every effort in solicitation since its establishment through the joint efforts of the Guangdong Association in Shanghai, the Guangzhao Guildhall, the Cantonese Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Chaozhou Guildhall, and the Chaozhou Compatriot Association. Previously, Mr. Lin Bingyan, the captain of the branch, solely purchased 150,000 yuan to encourage his fellow countrymen. This amount was immediately paid to the Guangdong Bank for collection. It is now reported that subscribers are even more enthusiastic. However, as Guangdong compatriots are scattered throughout Shanghai, the branch is concerned that solicitation may not be comprehensive and that those who are enthusiastic may not know how to subscribe. Therefore, it has specially borrowed Room 326 of the New Asia Hotel as a temporary office to facilitate subscriptions. Furthermore, it has broadly recruited team members and distributed small solicitation notices to inform compatriots in Shanghai of how to subscribe and jointly alleviate the national crisis.</p>
<p>Wuxi Compatriots. The Wuxi Compatriot Association in Shanghai believes that National Salvation Bonds are necessary to strengthen national resources and expand war preparations. Since it began to encourage compatriots to subscribe, significant results have been achieved. However, this has not yet met the predetermined total amount. Therefore, it scheduled a meeting at its office at 116 Zhonghui Building yesterday and appointed Rong Zongjing, Jiang Zheqing, and more than ten others as solicitation committee members to be responsible for solicitation. At the same time, subscription payments will be submitted to Zhonghui Bank for transfer to the main association. Once the total amount is met, it will be reported to the main corps for record.</p>
<p>Muslim Organizations. Muslim organizations in the city, recognizing the urgency of the national crisis, believe that contributing wealth to save the country is a national duty. They have specially formed the Muslim Branch of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee to actively proceed, establishing National Religious Friend Squads and Detachments to promote the responsibility of "giving money if you have it." It is reported that the rules and regulations have been compiled into a booklet. The office is located at the Zhejiang Road Mosque, and religious friends are voluntarily subscribing with great enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>German Community Celebrates the Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Uprising in Germany</h3>
<p>Russel Praises Our National Unity, China Has Achieved Spiritual Transformation Today</p>
<p>November 9th is the anniversary of the Nazi Party's Munich Uprising in Germany. The German community in Shanghai also held enthusiastic celebrations. Mr. Russel, the Deputy Leader of the Nazi Party in Shanghai, gave a speech, praising not only the great achievements of the German leader Hitler in transforming the German nation, but also praising China's national unity today in resisting foreign aggression and its hope for future national revival. His speech stated, "We in Shanghai have witnessed China's war of resistance for self-defense for nearly three months, which is an unprecedented feat in Chinese history. Anyone familiar with the history of China in the past 25 years knows that China has achieved a spiritual transformation today. From self-reliance, it has generated a strength that was previously considered impossible by many. What deserves our admiration is not only the bravery and fearless spirit of the Chinese soldiers, but most importantly, the entire nation has united under the name 'China' to become an unbreakable great nation. All forces that were previously divided and unable to cooperate have now united on one front to fight for the sacred task of defending their homeland. Therefore, we dare to offer our sincere sympathy to the Chinese nation and wish them to forever maintain their unity and never again give the enemy an opportunity to invade." Mr. Russel also expressed his deep gratitude for all the excellent treatment received by the German community in China.</p>
<h3>Monks' Rescue Team Bravely Takes Action</h3>
<p>Master Hongming Leads Team Members to Rescue Refugees at Fenglin Bridge</p>
<p>After our army's positions west of Shanghai moved south yesterday morning, residents in areas south of Shanghai, such as Longhua, carried boxes and led the elderly and young, fleeing towards the French Concession. However, most of these people are poor farmers, trekking long distances in extreme distress, all heading towards Fenglin Bridge. The tragic situation cannot be fully described in words. Upon learning of this, the Monks' Rescue Team, led by Master Hongming, immediately rushed to rescue them, carrying items for the refugees. At the same time, another team was sent to Zhongshan Hospital to rescue the more than 800 wounded soldiers who had been sent to the hospital for treatment after being injured on the battlefield. Even the smallest item was carefully bandaged and carried out of the hospital. Their bravery and compassionate hearts are truly exemplary. Moreover, the order was well-maintained, which could not have been achieved without thorough training. The reporter, having witnessed the process, was deeply moved and therefore reported it.</p>
<h3>City Education Association Board Meeting</h3>

Those receiving accommodation should have proof from their original school or a director or supervisor of the association. The number of people is temporarily set at two hundred.</p>
<h3>Remaining Embers of the Four Banks Warehouse Spread to the Lower Levels</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Warehouse, once where our lone northern army led by Commander Xie and Battalion Commander Yang valiantly stood guard, continues to have thick smoke and flames erupting from it. The smell of burning is noticeable as far away as Xinzha on the south bank of the Suzhou River. The Continental Warehouses have already been completely burned down, so the embers have long been extinguished.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Christian Writers Strive for International Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Christian writers in Shanghai, recently initiated by Dr. Xu Baoqian, Dr. Chen Wenyuan, and others, have held two meetings at the YMCA on Ba Xianqiao Road to discuss what contributions should be made to the overall war of resistance. It is reported that they have decided to publish publications, one to awaken the united front of Christian believers in China to strengthen the war of resistance, and one to widely propagate to Christian countries around the world, hoping to uphold justice. They also convened a third meeting yesterday to actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts of the City Solicit Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Advocating for 300,000 Refugees</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the Boy Scouts of the city have been diligently engaged in relief work. Their enthusiasm and perseverance have been praised by people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. Recognizing that the weather is getting colder and the 300,000 women and children refugees who have fled to Shanghai are suffering from hunger and cold, they have launched a city-wide Boy Scout campaign to solicit winter clothing to relieve the immediate needs of the refugees. Shanghai is not lacking in enthusiastic people who will surely donate generously. It is reported that the solicitation measures have already been drafted and will begin implementation tomorrow.</p>
<h3>News from the YWCA</h3>

<p>Students from the Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School in Shanghai have historically come mainly from Hubei and Sichuan. After the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the school's management immediately began preparing to establish a branch school in the western countryside of Wuchang, so that students could easily gather. This has been going on for over a month. Everything is ready and classes will begin on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Yates Road Night School Alumni Association</h3>

It also has works by Pan Gongzhan and others. It will be published on the 11th and will be priced at three cents per copy.</p>
<h3>Record of Escape from Songyin</h3>
<p>— Remaining Life</p>
<p>Songyin is a small town under the jurisdiction of Jinshan County. It relies on the Zhangjing River and forms a market along the river, known as Main Street. There are hundreds of residents. The Songfeng Highway runs along the back of Main Street north of the river in a right angle. The newly built Songting Highway west of the city also meets at Zhangjing Bridge west of the city. The original road along the Zhangjing River allows boats to be pulled by trackers to Zhangyan. The road east of the city across the City River Bridge leads to Hougang. The roadbed is smooth and no different from a highway. Recently, Japanese troops have been traveling frequently, and the road surface is particularly solid. This time, the enemy troops entered the country and came from this road. Based on the terrain, it is estimated that the enemy landed at Jinshanwei, passed through Ganxiang to Hougang, then entered Songyin, and divided forces from Zhangyan, one heading to Songyin and the other to Zhangze, meeting at Mishidu, which is also geographically logical. The town's institutions include a police station, located on the north side of the river west of the city, near the highway station, the district office, the central school, and Songyin Elementary School, all located south of the river. The telephone bureau is located in the district office. Initially, the number of enemy troops arriving was said to be several thousand, and some said several hundred. Everyone's words differed, but it was known that in addition to occupying public institutions such as the district office and schools, the streets were crowded with people looking for places to rest their feet, so there must have been quite a few who came.</p>
<p>Songyin is said to be the place where the Immortal Chisongzi lived in seclusion, but the land has no mountains or hills and does not resemble it. It is probably a case of interpreting the words literally, coming from the meaning of the two characters Songyin. The residence of Chen Taoyi, the former governor of Jiangsu Province, is located behind Main Street. However, Chen was honest and self-disciplined, and his ancestral residence was never expanded. Compared with today's high-ranking officials and dignitaries returning to their hometowns with brocade robes and building grand mansions and scenic gardens, it is greatly inferior. After Chen retired from office, he still lived on his salary. His wife and sisters-in-law were as before. The villagers also did not recognize it as the home of the governor. This time, when the war broke out, it was heard that because of poverty, he was unable to take his family to the sea to live. Now he is also trapped in enemy territory. An honest official can be done, but it also cannot be done. On the 5th of this month, the situation gradually tightened. At that time, people in the telephone bureau had already fled, so there was no accurate news. The town only had rumors. In the afternoon, I visited District Chief Ding Chongzu (from Taixian, Jiangbei, appointed by the provincial government last year). According to him, Zhangyan seemed to have fallen, but a large force of national troops had arrived in Ganxiang, and the town could be guaranteed to be safe. The police station also had a telephone, but residents had no way of hearing it. The conscript team headquarters was located in the central school. Apart from Captain Cao, who had once summoned the conscripts to speak with words of fighting back if the enemy advanced, but waited until night, the district chief and captain were nowhere to be found. Initially, both the district chief and the captain had more military knowledge, so the district chief in the district warehouse and the captain in the training center both built air raid shelters, which could be used to take refuge when enemy planes came from afar. But this night, the room was empty. People must have been very frightened, but the residents did not know where the enemy was coming from and where to take refuge. Most women and children usually traveled by boat and car and did not know the directions. In addition, there had been continuous heavy rain and the roads were muddy, so there was chaos all night with no good solutions. The tragic situation is difficult to describe in words, but they could only get through each day as it came and sit and wait for slaughter.</p>
<p>On the 6th, it was not yet dawn when I heard the sound of leather shoes on the street. At first, I thought the national troops had arrived and was happy to greet them, but looking closely through the cracks in the door, the military uniforms did not seem to match. I quickly went out the back door and was seized by someone who looked like a military officer when I turned to Main Street. Unable to understand his language, he patted his knee as a gesture. I had no choice but to follow him. Along the way, I saw enemy soldiers saluting him, so this person must have been of high rank. Passing a barber shop with the door half open, he drew the four characters "I want to rest" on the ground with his command knife. The barber shop owner invited him in. After he sat down, the owner asked me if this person was Russian or Japanese. I said he was an "Oriental import." The owner panicked and stuck out his tongue, thinking he was a Russian soldier sent to help us resist the enemy, so he was serving him attentively. I took the opportunity to leave, but was then seized by an enemy plainclothes team. These plainclothes teams all wore dark blue Zhongshan suits with a leather belt around their waists and two pistols hanging on each side. Speaking with a Shandong accent, they used a commanding tone, shouting to lead them to find empty houses and asking about my occupation and origin. I lied that I was passing through here last night and did not know where there were any empty houses, but they still pointed their pistols at me, forcing me to go with them. Walking on the street from west to east, I saw many such plainclothes teams. The large bridge on the Songfeng Road to Zhujing and the Pagoda Bridge on the road to Songjiang both had guards who were very strict in their inspection. Only the Songting Bridge to Tinglin was unguarded, so I decided to escape along this road, but I heard that Tinglin had fallen into enemy hands, so I could not go along the highway. So, I pretended to urinate and took the opportunity to escape through a small alley. I walked three miles to Xizhuangwan, which was originally a desolate village, but now was full of refugees. It was already full. Then I thought that the enemy troops had just arrived and had not yet gone to the countryside, but this place was too close to the town and would be difficult to avoid, so I left after a short rest. I walked four miles to Zhangze and met a passerby who said that everyone in the town had fled and there was no way to ask for directions. So, the two of us went together, picking up the road to the northeast. After another seven miles, I reached Yexie. I rolled in the mud all day and walked about ten miles. Before I knew it, it was already dark.</p>
<p>Yexie had police, prison guards, and conscripts, and they were rushing to build defensive fortifications, but the curfew was early. I stayed overnight. The next day (7th), I took a refugee boat along the Pujiang River and arrived at Minhang in about two hours. The residents of Minhang had also fled. The transportation available was the so-called "wild chicken" small chartered cars. Chartering a car once to send you to Shanghai costs 150 yuan, plus a 2,000 yuan security deposit, or some would scold that they were taking advantage of the fire to loot. But thinking that they were taking great risks, they were also people who valued money more than life. I also paid 20 yuan to book a seat, but after waiting until the afternoon, it did not come out. I was afraid of missing the opportunity, so I had to abandon my right to ride and walked along the highway near Qianliang Temple. I saw an old woman sitting stiffly with her head hanging down in a car. The car body was pierced like a honeycomb. This old woman was obviously killed by shrapnel. I don't know whose wife or mother she was. Her husband and young children were eagerly waiting for her to return. I also saw a destroyed truck, loaded with refugees who had been bombed to death, all looking like roasted chickens. The shocking scene is indescribable. There were even more cars and trucks overturned in the ditches along the road. At times, two enemy planes would take turns strafing and bombing downwards. I saw a car in trouble, but under these circumstances, I was only busy under the trees and in the grass, stumbling with every step, and had no time to watch more. In the evening, I finally arrived at Xujiahui. Thinking back on what I had experienced in the past three days, my heart was still uneasy.</p>

<h3>Our Military and Police Firmly Defend South City, Enemy Violently Attacks Rihui Port This Morning</h3>
<p>Twice Attacked Under the Cover of Tanks, Both Times Repelled, Huge Explosion in West Shanghai This Morning Caused by Our Army Destroying Bridges</p>
<p>Songjiang Still in Our Hands as of Now</p>
<p>After our army deployed new positions on the Nanxiang-Qibao line, the enemy has not dared to advance lightly and is busy building fortifications. The front line is relatively quiet. The battles in the suburbs of Songjiang are fierce. As of this afternoon, Songjiang is still in our hands. This reporter observed enemy cavalry patrolling back and forth on the main street of Xujiahui, Jinyi Bridge, Fenglin Bridge, Dapu Bridge and other places this morning. Military transport is very busy. The enemy is rushing to build fortifications in the Damuqiao and Fenglin Bridge areas. The French Concession's waterfront area is heavily guarded by a large number of French troops, prohibiting pedestrians and cutting off traffic. Seven enemy planes circled and scouted across the Dapu Bridge and dropped leaflets. According to eyewitness reports from local residents, at about 6:00 am this morning, the enemy used a regiment of troops, with six tanks as cover, to violently attack our Rihui Port line. Our army responded calmly, and for a while, small cannons and machine guns roared. The enemy was unable to withstand and retreated after about 20 minutes. Then, they used flat-trajectory guns to bombard our coastal positions. Our army ignored them. After 7:00 am, it became quiet again. At about 9:00 am, the enemy used small tanks to cover dozens of infantry and tried to attack again. Our army waited until they were close and fired machine guns, killing or wounding more than ten enemies, who then retreated. It is said that the loud noise at about 4:00 am this morning, which shook the glass windows of residential houses in the western Shanghai area, was caused by our Rihui Port defending army using a large amount of explosives to cut off bridges. Furthermore, according to our military authorities, the loyal military and police who are defending South City are all determined to sacrifice and coexist with the land. If the enemy continues to attack, they will surely shed a huge amount of blood and consume countless ammunition, exchanging this last piece of Shanghai land at the highest price.</p>
<h3>Our Enemy Forces Confront Each Other Across the River at Rihui Port</h3>
<p>Enemy Attempts to Attack Twice This Morning, Both Times Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Our army was ordered to defend South City to the death. From the Rihui Port bridgehead west of Rue du Père Robert Dapu Bridge, along Rihui Port to Longhua Road, extremely strong fortifications have been deployed. Our and the enemy armies are confronting each other across the river. At 6:00 am this morning, the enemy used five tanks, covering more than 100 infantry, and rushed from Fenglin Bridge along Xie Xu Road to the Rihui Port bridgehead. The bridge had already been destroyed by our army. Enemy vehicles attempted to cross the river, but were repeatedly machine-gunned by our army, killing countless enemies. The enemy vehicles then retreated. At about 8:00 am, two more enemy vehicles came, followed by more than 30 infantry, who shot at our positions at the bridgehead. Our army immediately counterattacked, and more than ten enemy soldiers fell to the ground. They retreated to behind the broken houses of the Shanghai Rubber Factory. The enemy is rushing to build fortifications in the Huomu Bridge Fenglin Bridge area. Hundreds of enemy troops are extremely busy back and forth in Xujiahui Jinyi Bridge and other places. Six or seven enemy planes circled and scouted over our army this morning and did not leave until noon.</p>
<h3>Enemy Outpost Troops Attack West Along Avenue Petain</h3>
<p>Our Army Encircled and Annihilated More Than 100 Enemies</p>
<p>The Central News Agency military reporter reported at 1:00 pm on the 10th that after our army was ordered to move west from the Zhujiabang area on the south bank of the Suzhou River, it had deployed a new line near Huacao Town yesterday morning. However, our covering troops were still in the Hechen Lane area about 600 meters east of the town. At 9:30 pm last night, an enemy outpost force of about 300 people advanced west along Avenue Petain and encountered our army. Our army immediately adopted an encircling formation and annihilated more than 100 enemies. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy retreated under the cover of tanks.</p>
<h3>Our Fresh Forces Encircle the Mishidu Area</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency military reporter reported at 1:00 pm on the 10th that at about 2:00 am this morning, our fresh forces had encircled and annihilated the remaining enemies at Mishidu Ferry and Jinjigang south of Songjiang Station. The enemy was trapped in a heavy encirclement. Although they衝擊 desperately, they were ultimately unable to break out. As of 7:30 am this morning, enemy deaths and injuries had reached 400.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Two Locations in Shihudang</h3>
<p>Enemy Trapped in Heavy Encirclement, Unable to Advance or Retreat</p>
<p>Part of the enemy landed at Quan Gongting and抄 to Zhangyan Songyin and then, along Songfeng Road to Cuanlai Temple Zhujing, 北窜 Shihudang. On the evening of the 7th, they engaged in a fierce battle with a strong旅 of our某师, and it continued until this morning. Our精銳部隊 have also sent by ××方面, 直围 the 31st and 34th Bridges. The enemy has fallen into a heavy encirclement, unable to advance or retreat.</p>
<h3>Enemy Gathers in the Xujiahui Area</h3>
<p>The enemy forces attacking South City are gathering in the Xujiahui area, and a lot of military equipment, light and heavy, has been transported. From last night, they have been rushing to build fortifications in Damuqiao Fenglin Bridge and other places. This morning (the 10th), hundreds of enemy troops were sent to patrol and loot in various places. At the same time, many enemy planes, in groups of three or five, flew over the sky above South City and the neighboring French Concession to spy for a long time, but did not drop bombs.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Pudong Remains as Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Pudong area is vast, estimated to be a quarter of the size of Shanghai, bordering the three counties of Shangnan and Chuan. It is still being defended by our strong forces. A reporter observed in the morning that civilians from all four rural areas were continuously moving westward along the roads. Brave and loyal police officers stood at key intersections, busily directing traffic with orderly discipline. Two or three enemy planes flew in the sky, constantly conducting reconnaissance. The grinding sound of their engines did not attract the attention of pedestrians. All the shops on the streets remained open for business. Being among them, one did not feel the fear of wartime at all. The reporter lingered with several friends on Pudong Avenue for a long time. Looking into the distance, it felt as though this remaining eastern front battlefield within the overall Shanghai-Songhu battle remained as before, unmoved.</p>
<h3>The Enemy in Yangshupu Opens Fire to Probe</h3>
<p>At 5:45 AM on the 10th, enemy troops in the Yangshupu area fired a shot at our army's Pudong positions. The sound reverberated throughout Shanghai, startling citizens awake from their sleep. However, our army did not return fire, so the enemy did not continue shelling. It is said that the enemy troops were probing our army's strength.</p>
<h3>Enemy Hospital Ship Arrives in Shanghai Again This Morning</h3>
<p>Enemy planes continue to fly reconnaissance missions.</p>
<p>At 6:10 AM today, a large enemy Red Cross hospital ship arrived in Shanghai again and docked at the China Merchants' Central Wharf on the Huangpu River. After unloading dozens of boxes of medicine, it loaded over 1,800 wounded soldiers. This continued until around 12:00 PM without completion and departure. It is reported that this was the 23rd time this ship had come to Shanghai, and the total number of wounded soldiers transported back and forth has reached over 20,000.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Enemy Planes Active Everywhere</h3>
<p>From 6:00 AM to 9:30 AM today, a total of over 40 enemy planes flew from the enemy air base in the Yangshupu area. Most of them flew towards the western part of Shanghai, while others circled and conducted reconnaissance over various parts of the city. In addition, two enemy seaplanes on the Huangpu River also flew low over the Pudong and Nanshi areas, circling and simulating bombing runs. They finally left at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Starting at dawn this morning, three enemy planes flew to the Nanshi riverside area for a long time to reconnoiter. Around 8:00 AM, three more planes flew in from the northeast, circled over the city, and then flew south along Ximen to Gaochang Temple, turning west along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Then, around 10:00 AM, two enemy planes randomly strafed the riverside docks with machine guns for a quarter of an hour before leaving. Around 11:00 AM, three more planes reconnoitered over Nanshi, and had not been seen returning by noon.</p>
<p>Around 12:00 PM this afternoon, two enemy planes flew to the Nanshi area to reconnoiter for a long time. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, ten more planes arrived, taking off from the eastern part of Shanghai. They first circled Pudong once, and then flew to the Nanshi area along Lujiabang Road, heading towards Rihui Port and Dapu Bridge.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Bring 500 Engineers</h3>
<p>And Over a Hundred Tanks and Armored Vehicles</p>
<p>Today (the 10th) around 7:00 AM, three enemy transport ships, the Moruto, the Eumo, and the No. 142 transport ship Shunyang Maru (converted from a merchant ship), successively sailed to Shanghai and docked at Huishan Wharf and the North Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. They carried 500 enemy engineers, over a hundred tanks and armored vehicles each, and over 300 military trucks.</p>
<h3>Situation of Enemy Troops Landing in Jinshanwei</h3>
<p>Talks with Refugees Escaping from Zhangyan</p>
<p>Repeated Encounters with Military Police Resistance Along the Way; Buying Over Hearts and Minds, Tempting Our Villagers</p>
<p>Recently, someone who had escaped to Shanghai from Zhangyan Town in Jinshan County told a reporter in detail about the enemy's landing in Jinshanwei. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gunfire Along the Beach on the Morning of the 5th</p>
<p>The enemy landed in Jinshanwei in the early morning of the 5th, immediately engaging in guerrilla warfare with customs and salt police. At that time, responsible personnel from Jinshanwei, Jinshan Zui, Quan Gong Ting, and Jin Si Niang Bridge were still in telephone contact with Zhangyan, learning that the number of enemy troops landing was only two or three hundred.</p>
<p>Impersonating Fishermen, Spotting the Treachery</p>
<p>When the enemy landed, they impersonated fishermen. The troops landing at Jinshanwei forcibly cut off the clothes worn by the fishermen who were fishing along the coast and put on Japanese uniforms. They were quickly discovered by our military police, but due to the enemy's superior numbers, effective resistance was impossible. Finally, around 7:00 AM that morning, the enemy's advance troops had reached Da Shitou and fled north to Jiao Li An Town. At that time, telephone lines between Zhangyan and Quan Gong Ting were also lost.</p>
<p>Encounters with Military Police Attacks Along the Way</p>
<p>After the enemy reached Jiao Li An, military police near Zhangyan immediately went out to resist. After holding out until noon, enemy troops who had landed at Caojing and those who had landed at Quan Gong Ting also divided into groups of twenty or thirty and advanced along two routes, east and west, towards Zhangyan Town. The troops in Quan Gong Ting seemed to enter Qin Huang Mountain north of Zhangjia Orange, reaching Zhangyan via Hejing Bay. The troops in Caojing seemed to reach Yangxupu via Hequekou to Shanyang Yi Duo Bridge. The residents of the town fled in panic, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Gunfire Erupts at One PM</p>
<p>By 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Zhangyan Town was surrounded on all sides by the enemy, and gunfire erupted. The enemy again divided their forces and fled to Songyin. Thousands of refugees also fled in different directions, west to Zhujing and northwest to Xianlai Temple, Zhao Zhi Mishi Ferry, and Yexie.</p>
<p>Resistance Again Encountered in Songyin and Yexie</p>
<p>The enemy encountered resistance from our military police in Songyin and Yexie. This time, the enemy suffered heavier casualties than before. The direction of Mishi Ferry had already been tightly blocked by our army. The troops that divided from Zhangyan and went east to Tinglin joined forces with the Caojing team and went east to Zhuangjiahang, Hui, An Mou, all the way to Nanjiao.</p>
<p>Our Troops Head to Tuolin to Meet and Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>On the night of the 5th and the morning of the 6th, our troops first advanced from ××× to the west of Tuolin, surrounding the enemy. The enemy then dared not go deep. We fled from Zhangyan to Yangxipu and Zhuangjiahang, repeatedly encountering violent enemies along the way, and then swam out of the tiger's mouth. Once, the enemy's bullets had run out, and because the clothes worn by the enemy were the same as those worn by our national army, I mistakenly thought the enemy was a friend. I stepped forward and asked, "Old fellow villager, are there any of our brothers in front to send us out?" The enemy heard that I was Chinese, and although he had no bullets by his side, he still hit me with the butt of his gun. I leaned back and, regardless of life and death, pounced on Xiaobang, luckily escaping death, but my right hand had been hit and my fingers were broken. From this mountain road, I hurried day and night to the headquarters of our ×× army and escaped the tiger's mouth on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Military Law Enforcement Supervisor of the First War Zone</h3>
<p>Concurrently Held by Fan Songfu</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Military Law Enforcement Supervisor of the First War Zone, Mr. Zhang Yinwu, also serves as the Director of Civilian Training, and his affairs are very busy and cannot be taken care of. He has recently been reassigned to concurrently serve as the Army Commander of the Forty-Sixth Army, Fan Songfu (Central News Agency Cable on the 9th).</p>
<h3>Fengxian as Perilous as Eggs on a Pile</h3>
<p>Nanhui is in the Same State</p>
<p>The situation in Fengxian is deteriorating day by day. In the western countryside, the enemy has occupied Xinxishi from Tuolin. Their advance troops have progressed to Liuli Dun, two or three miles away from Nanqiao, with the potential to reach Minhang. Although there are no traces of the enemy in the eastern countryside and the Xinchang area of Nanhui, the residents have long since moved away. Local thugs take the opportunity to rob, and few can escape. As for enemy planes bombing, the heaviest loss was in Fengcheng, which has been bombed for three consecutive days since the 5th and has become scorched earth. The casualties are unknown. The principal of the local school, Shen Zhigang, had his head and feet blown off and died on the spot. Nanqiao has long been deserted. All the county government, the Grain Commission, the Security Team headquarters, and various shops such as Dingfeng Jiangyuan and Sida have been burned to the ground. Several fires have also started in Zhuanghang. According to the situation yesterday afternoon, the entire county was on the verge of falling. County Magistrate Yu Xilai was unable to maintain order and had no choice but to retreat to Shanghai. Police Chief Zhou had gone to the front line with the army. Very few of the disaster-stricken people escaped from the eastern countryside, and not many escaped from the western countryside. They have all temporarily taken refuge in the countryside to avoid danger. Of the several thousand refugees who have escaped to Shanghai in recent days, even the wealthy are struggling to escape the disaster. The most tragic of those who have suffered are Ding Zhiyan's wife, children, and more than a dozen people including the Zhuang family mother and daughter, who were completely sacrificed when their car was bombed by enemy planes near Caohejing the day before yesterday. Ding witnessed the tragic scene and immediately drew his gun to commit suicide, but passers-by rushed forward to hold him tightly, encouraging him with righteousness. He sighed and turned away, ignoring everything and rushing to the front line. All the corpses were cremated by the sulfur bombs and could not be collected. There were no less than thirty people who were shot and wounded by enemy machine guns on the Shanghai-Minhang-Hangzhou Road, and the number of those killed in Tuolin and other places is not yet known. According to people who escaped from various towns in the county today, they saw more than three thousand people crying out for passage on the opposite bank of Minhang and in the two ports of Zhagang and Shazhu. Therefore, last night, Shanghai fellow townsmen Cheng Weiyu, Lu Shenguang, He Binyi, Wang Daoming, Lai Xie Jun, Cai Jianfu, Diao Yebai, etc., gathered for a meeting to ask the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association to ask the International Relief Committee to find ways to save them. On the one hand, they are starting to prepare food for the Shanghai population and raise relief funds. Part of it has been agreed with the county magistrate to transfer existing public funds for reserve use, which is currently being rushed. Wang Hongwen, the director of the Education Bureau, has established a liaison office in Shanghai. All incumbent primary school teachers' salaries for October and November will be paid in full, and those in Shanghai can contact nearby for convenience. County Magistrate Yu, for the refugee relief issues, and various local circles, also set up temporary offices. As for the troops in Fengxian, due to strategic changes, they have retreated to the new defense line when the recognizers issue the manuscript, so the wind of looting is even worse than before. It is heard that the situation is the same in Nanhui. According to reports from people who escaped from the port today, Xinchang, Zhoupu, and Datuan suffered huge losses, and the facts have fallen into a state of stagnation.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Leaves Before Meeting British and American Representatives</h3>
<p>The Meeting is Currently Awaiting a Reply from Japan; Representatives from Various Countries Are Busy Negotiating</p>
<p>Brussels: The sudden departure of Soviet chief representative Litvinov from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels to return to Moscow is the main topic of discussion among the representatives today. It is widely believed that Mr. Litvinov took this step because some people are pushing to prevent the Soviet Union from joining the small mediation committee that is about to be set up, so he is expressing his opposition by this means. Before the Secretary left, he visited American chief representative Davis and British chief representative Eden. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Bodingkin is still here and will serve as the Soviet chief representative. At the same time, the work of the New Organization Committee to deal with Japan's reply has been temporarily shelved. It is planned to decide how to deal with it after receiving Japan's reply. Today's meeting lasted a very short time. The county will listen to Davis' short declaration and is expected to decide whether the meeting should be extended to the scheduled date or the date when Japan's reply arrives. It is hoped that the reply will arrive by the end of this week. Today is the anniversary of the armistice of the European War, and a banquet will be held in the evening. Davis, Eden, and British Dominion Minister MacDonald will all attend the banquet. In addition to meeting with Litvinov yesterday, Eden also met with Davis, Spaak, and Guo Taiqi.

He suddenly suffered a heart attack en route and died on board at the age of seventy-one. The remains will be unloaded on the 15th of this month when the ship arrives in the British Bermudian Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. (Havas Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Established in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Princes and Dukes of Various Leagues and Banners Insist on Not Yielding</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the enemy troops entered Suiyuan, they used their old tricks of coercion and inducement, forcing the various leagues and banners of Ximeng to break away from the central government. Last month, they convened a so-called conference of representatives of the Inner Mongolian Leagues and Banners to establish a puppet organization. However, according to reliable information, among the five departments and thirteen banners belonging to the Ulanqab and Ik Zhao Leagues in Suiyuan, only the princes and dukes of the Siziwang Banner and the Maoming'an Banner of the Ulan League were forced to turn against them. Other departments and banners, such as the Zhonggong Uxin Eotok and Urat, still refused to yield under the threat of a strong enemy. The Hangjin Banner even issued a telegram after the establishment of the puppet organization, expressing its bright attitude of supporting the central government. The general public in Inner Mongolia eagerly hope that the national army will recover the lost land as soon as possible and break away from the Japanese shackles.

<h3>Zhaohe Ship Captain Fang Nianzu Dismissed and Investigated</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] When the Zhaohe warship was docked in the Huangpu waters a month ago, enemy planes attempted to bomb it daily. The ship's captain, Fang Nianzu, disobeyed orders and neglected his duties. Yesterday, the Military Commission telegraphed General Commander Yu Hanmou to detain and investigate him, and requested an official order to dismiss him, as a warning to those who delay military operations.

<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Taiyuan Refugees</h3>
<p>In the Area of Tongpu Road and Tai Fen Road; Jinpu Road Passenger Cars Also Attacked</p>
<p>Linfen: Taiyuan is preparing for the defense of the city. In order to avoid the destruction of enemy artillery fire, many residents are moving to other places. Since the first day, refugees have been continuously traveling along the Tongpu Road and Tai Fen Road. Enemy planes have been brutally bombing the non-combatant refugees on the way, wantonly. In the Fenhe River bank and Jiexiu station alone, as many as five or six hundred people were brutally slaughtered. According to eyewitnesses, the enemy planes especially bombed and strafed these two places. Corpses were piled up everywhere, and broken limbs and viscera were everywhere. Those who were lucky enough not to be harmed were searching for the remains of relatives, and the cries of grief and the cries for help from the wounded and not dead shook the heavens and the earth. The cruelty of the enemy army has been reduced to nothing more than a beastly act! (Central News Agency Cable on the 9th)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Four enemy planes flew along our Su-Wan and Jin-Long roads this morning, bombing the Jinpu southbound train No. 305. Three bombs were dropped by enemy planes south of Nansuzhou, injuring and killing more than a dozen passengers. The passengers on the entire train were indignant and called the enemy inhuman for bombing travelers. The road also telegraphed the Iron Department to report. Unexpectedly, the enemy planes deliberately wreaked havoc on their return journey and dropped two bombs each at Xuzhou Station and Dapu, fortunately without injuring anyone. (Special Telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 9:00 AM this morning, three enemy planes roamed north and south of Luokou Bridge, dropping three bombs each, all of which missed their targets and caused no losses. They were repelled by our anti-aircraft artillery. (Special Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Trivial Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>An editorial in the London Times stated that both Germany and Italy fear that Japan will be exhausted by the war, and that China will be disrupted by the war, causing communism to take advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate. This inference is deeply to the point. If Japan is exhausted by the war and loses its ability to contain the Far East, and Germany and Italy are disrupted by the war, communism will inevitably invade. Our country originally did not agree with communism, and opposed and suppressed communism. But now, the enemy is specially creating a communist country for China. Planes are bombing everywhere, and famous cities and towns are turned into ashes. Industry and commerce are unemployed, and scholars and people are displaced. This has increased our hatred of the enemy and created the qualifications for our communist people. Then how can the country not become a communist country? The enemy wants to occupy our huge land, wants to live and work in peace, and illegal rule is probably a dream. Therefore, the anti-Er pact of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy is more appropriately called a co-construction pact than an anti-communist pact.</p>

<h3>The Points of Certain Victory in the Beijing Conference and Our Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Wu Benzhong</p>
<p>The Chinese people are very concerned about the Beijing Conference, but most are pessimistic and few are optimistic.</p>
<p>If we observe the current situation, it is difficult for this international conference, which was convened based on the Nine-Power Treaty, to give our country "immediate satisfaction." The reason is very clear: the violent Japan is not convinced by "force." "Force" has the distinction between economic power and military power; however, if there is only the former and the latter is not used as a backing, then under the current situation in East Asia and the international situation, it is not only difficult to have a real effect, but also a real idea. If there are no unexpected events, especially strict markets, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which are hosting this conference, will definitely not think of lightly moving their weapons, and Japan has no such preparations either. If there is a lack of military force and less restrictions, they will sing the song of "sincerity and peace," hoping that Japan will lay down its butcher knife and immediately become a Buddha: is it easy? This is why the Beijing Conference is extremely difficult to give our country a "current" and "practical" complete victory.</p>
<p>However, if we can look at the past, look forward to the future, and recognize that this international conference is an important stage in our people's anti-war diplomacy, rather than the final gate; we must not stick to temporary satisfaction; we must broaden our horizons, deploy diplomatic lines, and make persistent efforts to achieve a complete victory in the future; then this Beijing Conference has extremely important significance for our country, and also has the points of certain victory that can be obtained; we must pay special attention to it!</p>
<p>㊀ Sir Samuel Hoare, when he was British Foreign Secretary a year ago, deeply considered the actions of Japan in the Far East; he said to his colleagues: "What threatens us is no longer the yellow pot, but the 'Saffron-colored disaster.'" That is, the color of burning sulfur; "We will cause a European war because of the Near East problem, igniting the medicine storehouse; I believe that today's Far East problem can cause a greater fire in the world." "However! It is a pity that the firefighters are not of one mind, do not know how to contact each other, and cooperate with each other!" Indeed, since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, it has been fifteen years, and the "fire brigades" - namely the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, etc. - have always had disagreements and stood by and watched whenever they encountered a "major danger," resulting in today's serious situation. The fact that there can be tangible cooperation and the formation of a powerful "firefighting front" should begin with this Beijing Conference. Its arrival period is slightly late, but its trend is favorable to our country, which cannot be denied. We know very well that there may be those who want to "take advantage of the fire to rob" mixed in this team; but we are even happier that a new firefighting warrior - Russia - has joined. Therefore, our country's diplomatic strategy must seize the opportunity of this conference and use diplomatic means to concretely realize this "Far East firefighting front" and build it firmly! ! ! The profound significance of this, and the great relationship with the future of our nation, we have no time to discuss in detail here; our compatriots can also understand it.</p>
<p>㊀ During the Franco-Prussian War, the French great man, Gambetta, refused to accept defeat. He flew out of the siege of Paris by balloon and arrived in Bordeanx in the south to form a government of national salvation to continue the struggle. The greatness of his spirit really opened the foundation for the French renaissance. The place where he himself gained strength was that he had an unbreakable belief. What was his belief? That is, he firmly believed that the grievance of a large nation must eventually be redressed, and that "justice" is eternal. We, the survivors of China, have suffered injustice for a hundred years. After hearing these wise words, after weeping bitterly, we should have a sacred belief, that is, believe that the day when our 400 million compatriots are redressed is not far away. The Beijing Conference is based on the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on the sixth of last month, the report of the twenty-three-nation Advisory Committee, and the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, then our diplomatic foothold is extremely stable, and legally and justly, we have become an invincible force. If we hold on to this point and do not leave the altar, we can apply it infinitely. May I ask, if we do not despair, who else can be ashamed to clearly violate the basic covenant of convening the conference and propose to me the conditions of not "respecting China's sovereignty and independence, as well as the integrity of its territory and administration," "keeping promises is the only maintenance requirement for slightly organized crowds since the beginning of the wilderness. If the market is set up between Japan and China and midnight has not arrived, then the seeds of human civilization will be destroyed and return to the world of weeds. If deerskin is promised and a dog's tail is given, even barbarians have no way of trading. The reason why international law has the principle of Pacta sunt Servanda (a Latin idiom, the translated meaning can be: when a covenant is established, the obligation follows) is that it is the meaning of observing the covenant, precisely because human evolution has reached the point where the international community has mutual order. If many dignified and solemn covenants are allowed to be equal to broken paper, then not only will the international community have nothing to maintain and become a strongman universe, but the whole world can also regress to the era of eating raw meat and drinking blood! How can civilization be so! One justice and one international faith are not China's private affairs, but the public treasures of countries around the world. We ascend to the world's diplomatic stage to call for the soul of justice. Who can stop it, who can bend it, cannot stop it, cannot bend it, this is the point of our diplomatic victory, which must never be relaxed. (Draft on the opening day of the Beijing Conference (</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Refugees Fleeing to the Concessions</h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands Crowding at Old North Gate and Nanyang Bridge; Xie Bridge Iron Gate Already Closed</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the refugee zone in the Nanshi area within the city began on the 9th, the Red Cross flag of the International Relief Committee has been flying in the wind at places like Old North Gate and Minkuo Road. Local shops reopened for business yesterday. However, today, due to the influx of refugees from areas such as Rihui Port, Fenglin Bridge, and Xietu Road, resembling swarms of ants, shops on Minkuo Road and other places closed again today. The iron gate at the Old North Gate leading to the concession saw refugees pouring in like a tide. The French Concession authorities specially dispatched Chinese and French police, as well as detectives, to stand inside and outside the iron fence, doing their best to maintain order so that refugees could pass through shoulder to shoulder in an orderly manner. Those carrying cages, boxes, and packages were prohibited from entering the concession, and those with suspicious behavior were subjected to inspection. The reporter then went to Nanyang Bridge for inspection, where the crowded and chaotic situation at the iron gate leading to the concession was no less severe than at the Old North Gate. It is said that the iron gate at Xie Bridge has been closed due to the situation, so the actual passages from Nanshi to the concessions have been reduced to the above two places.</p>
<p>Further news reports that after our army withdrew from western Shanghai, a portion of the troops continued to defend Nanshi, confronting the enemy across Rihui Port. From dawn today, enemy planes flew over Nanshi for reconnaissance and indiscriminate bombing. Although the refugee zone in the Nanshi area is still relatively stable, the number of residents south of the refugee zone is still very large, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands. Starting from the 9th, they have been rushing to the French Concession for refuge. This morning, even more people sought refuge. At the iron gate entrances of Nanyang Bridge and Old North Gate, the crowds waiting to enter the concession were enormous and extremely congested. The French authorities will stipulate that the Nanyang Bridge direction will only allow exiting the concession and refuse entry, while the Old North Gate direction will remain open as usual. Therefore, in the Old North Gate area, one sees tens of thousands of heads crowded together, surging like a tide. According to those who escaped from Xietu Road, after the enemy troops advanced into the sections west of Rihui Port, they set fires, killed people, and searched for refugees everywhere. Most of the young people were killed with bayonets, while the elderly, weak, women, and children were able to survive, but the cash they had with them was taken away by the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Further news reports that after the movement of our army's front lines, residents of Nanshi, due to numerous rumors, are moving to the concessions. I went to Minkuo Road, Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen and other places for inspection. Only Old North Gate Road is passable at the intersection of the Chinese and French concessions. On Minkuo Road and Zhonghua Road, moving vehicles followed one another closely, which were quite crowded. The military police authorities of the French Concession dispatched a large number of constables to maintain order at the iron gate. Other general conditions were still good. Shops were mostly half-open for business, and the street vendors were especially sparse. The residents' attitude was very calm, and the police authorities were particularly competent in maintaining law and order.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Pay Attention to Marine Insurance Compensation Matters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to the associations of all industries, stating, "Dear Sirs, We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from the foreign marine insurance association, forwarding a notice and requesting that it be distributed to all members for review. This association has translated the notice into Chinese and is forwarding it in a separate letter. We hope that you will review it, notify your affiliated industries to be aware of it, and pay attention to it. This is of utmost importance." The notice from the foreign marine insurance association is as follows: All insurance companies that are members of the foreign marine insurance association have now organized a special subcommittee to facilitate the resolution of various issues arising from the current war and to provide recommendations to policyholders requesting compensation for losses, as follows: (1) After receiving news of damage to goods, the policyholder should immediately notify the relevant insurance company or agent in writing and provide a detailed and accurate report of the situation. (2) If the insured goods can still be inspected, the policyholder should consult with the company and send an inspector to conduct an on-site inspection. The company and the inspector should have a clear and detailed understanding of the arrival location and delivery of the goods. (3) The policyholder should treat the insured goods as if they were not insured, so as to minimize the extent of the damage. In short, the policyholder must hold the policy and do everything possible to avoid various damages. There is a provision in the insurance law that policyholders should use various methods to protect their goods. (4) When the policyholder claims compensation from the company, the following documents should be submitted: (1) The original insurance policy with a formal signature, (2) The inspector's report, (3) The policyholder's bill, (4) The invoice and list, (5) A copy of the lawsuit prepared for claiming compensation from the responsible party. (Note) If the goods are completely damaged, the policyholder should submit all rights documents for inspection. (5) Due to the commercial stagnation in Shanghai and the inability to reach the docks, the investigation of damage to goods may be delayed. Policyholders must understand and be aware of this. The special subcommittee, on behalf of the insurance company, is investigating various news. Please cooperate with the above clauses so that the actual evidence of damage to the goods can be obtained immediately.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Generously Donates Rescue Funds</h3>
<p>Qiaqing Hospital Fund First Allocates 20,000</p>
<p>Although our army in western Shanghai has moved backward due to strategic reasons, the wounded soldiers currently staying in various hospitals in the city should still be given medical treatment to ensure their early recovery. It is learned that the Municipal Rescue Committee has decided to continue its work as usual. It is also learned that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in the city, had previously donated and solicited 3,000 yuan in national currency to the committee to address its financial difficulties. Yesterday, he also withdrew 20,000 yuan in national currency from the Qiaqing Hospital Fund as an advance loan to the committee to supplement the rescue funds.</p>
<h3>Severe Punishment for Taking the Opportunity to Raise Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Selling Price Must Not Exceed 14 Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Rice Merchants Association believes that the relationship with local people's food is important during this extraordinary period. Since the end of the People's Food Regulation Association, some rice merchants have taken the opportunity to raise rice prices. It was specially convened an emergency meeting to decide that the selling price of the same industry should comply with the regulations of the People's Food Association and should not exceed 14 yuan per dan to maintain the people's food. It was specially notified to all rice shops to comply with it, together with the Bean and Rice Industry Association. Dear Sirs, in this extraordinary period, local people's food is of the utmost importance. The market price of all rice and grain should still comply with the regulations of the former People's Food Regulation Association, and the selling price should not exceed 14 yuan per dan. All rice shops in the city, whether buying or selling, should comply with it. It is hoped that cargo merchants can understand this intention. If there is any overstepping, once discovered and verified, it will be reported to the local authorities for severe punishment. Fortunately, all industries pay close attention, so this notice is issued.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Holds Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Increase Police Force and Dispatch Constables to Patrol Strictly</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department believes that since the Shanghai War, the number of people in the boundary has greatly increased, and it is inevitable that good and bad are mixed. Moreover, theft cases have occurred frequently recently, and winter is approaching. It is deeply feared that thieves and bandits will take the opportunity to act, so winter defense is specially carried out. In addition to increasing the police force, each police station will send a number of armed Chinese and Indian constables, wearing steel armor, to patrol on the roads. If there are any suspicious persons, they will be stopped and searched. After this strict inspection and precaution, the bandits will be afraid, and the people will be safe.</p>
<h3>Three Industry Associations Request Extension of</h3>
<p>Registration Period for Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Municipal Yarn Industry, Instruments and Stationery Industry, and Iron Industry Associations believe that the deadline for registering Japanese goods is seven days. Now, because many of the responsible persons have left Shanghai, or the types are too numerous to handle, or they are stored in various places, making it inconvenient to go back and forth for inspection, they have all sent letters requesting the National Committee for Economic Severance from Japan to extend the registration deadline for one week to facilitate handling.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Introduces Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, after receiving a letter from the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, stated that there are a considerable number of registered unemployed workers, including specialized technical workers in machinery, electrical engineering, chemistry, industry, civil engineering, construction, and textiles. In addition to temporary shelter, it is urgent to find ways to introduce work so that they can work hard. If industrial groups and factories need these workers, they can write to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for introduction and contact.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Hospital Rescues Wounded Heroes</h3>
<p>Lack of Medical Supplies, etc., Hope All Circles Will Actively Donate</p>
<p>Qu Wenliu, Chairman of the Cilian Association's War Zone Refugee Relief Committee, Master Hongming, Deputy Captain of the Monks' Rescue Team, and Yu Zhongnan, for the sake of rescuing our loyal and brave wounded soldiers, specially established a Buddhist Hospital, and determined the residence of Zhou Yuntang on Niuzhuang Road as the hospital site. After our Hebei army withdrew on the 9th, Yu Zhongnan of the hospital received news from the Diplomatic Building and Zhongshan Hospital that three to four hundred wounded soldiers were stranded there. Yu and members of the Cilian Association sent people to Fenglin Bridge to rescue them and send them to the hospital, where doctors Chu Linsheng and Zeng Zhilin presided over the treatment. However, at the beginning of the hospital's operation, there was a severe shortage of medical cotton, gauze, rubber plaster, etc. It is hoped that all enthusiastic people will donate.</p>
<h3>Student Community's National Salvation Association Registers Displaced Students</h3>
<p>The Municipal Student Community's National Salvation Association, in order to solve the problems of livelihood, study, and work for displaced students, has specially processed registration procedures. Displaced university and middle school students can bring relevant introduction or certification documents to register. The registration office is at Guangxia Middle School, 999 Jingansi Road (near Fuxu Road), with Mr. Huang Chunyi in charge. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association has launched a "Great Shanghai Defense Movement Week" starting this week to intensify its work. On the first day, a joint symposium of various schools was held, attended by more than fifty representatives from more than twenty schools. The discussion was very enthusiastic. Yesterday, various schools held separate symposiums. Today, an expanded lecture will be held, and large-scale mobilization of various war zone service teams will begin, as well as fundraising and publicity efforts.</p>
<h3>YMCA Nursing Class Sixth Session Enrolls New Students</h3>
<p>The fifth session of the nursing class set up by the Shanghai YMCA at 999 Jingansi Road has been completed. Currently, there is a great demand for nursing service personnel everywhere. The association has decided to continue to open the sixth class, which will still be taught by people sent by the Red Cross, and the Red Cross will set the tuition fee at two yuan per person. Those who are enthusiastic about learning nursing and want to provide on-site service are invited to register at the association from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Reject Peace</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxing</p>
<p>Our leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, once told a French reporter in Nanjing: "Our country's war of resistance this time is not only for its own harm, but also for the justice of the whole world. If the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact are allowed to be torn up by Japan, the foundation of world peace will inevitably be shaken. We must continue to fight until justice is completely victorious." This fully declares our position on the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>The enemy's repeated aggressions have always been carried out by means of fighting and negotiating peace at the same time. In the past, we lost many territories or sovereignty, almost all because of this trick. On the one hand, they were conducting military operations, and on the other hand, they were conducting peace negotiations, using political division to help military occupation. As a result, we could only watch helplessly as they were slaughtered. At the beginning of the Lugou Bridge Incident, they performed this good show again. Sure enough, Song Zheyuan fell for their old trick again and lost Pingjin.</p>
<p>Since the start of the all-out War of Resistance, the vast majority of our people, except for a very few who were complacent and still hoped and longed for peace, have followed the government in embracing the determination to resist the war. We will never be tired of war, even if the war is extended to ten years or even a year. However, our lack of war-weariness is by no means "war-mongering," because our war is for justice, for righteousness, and for lasting world peace, which is completely different from the aggressive warlords of the invading country.</p>
<p>In recent days, I have heard that the enemy in Shanghai is eager for a truce, and at the same time, many traitors have secretly come to Shanghai from North China to promote peace. "Peace" is such a good-sounding word, who doesn't long for peace? Moreover, the Chinese nation is the most peace-loving, but because it loves peace so much, it does not hesitate to be fooled by everyone repeatedly. This call for peace makes me suspect that the enemy is using his consistent old trick again. To put it bluntly, we will never be hooked this time.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also said: "Once the War of Resistance is launched, there will be no compromise halfway." It is of course possible for the enemy to want peace, but we don't want false peace, peace for a time and a place, but real peace, and lasting world peace.</p>
<p>As long as we have a piece of territory occupied by the enemy, or even an inch of territory occupied by the enemy, and as long as we have some sovereignty in the hands of the enemy, we will not talk about peace. We will resist the war to the end. "Resistance is the mother of peace, and only resistance can produce true peace and lasting world peace."</p>
<p>"Advocates of peace are traitors," this is the slogan we used when we held the Great Shanghai Defense Movement. We are not absolutely refusing the enemy's acknowledgement of peace, because we can no longer fall into the enemy's trap. Therefore, the peace we need must be built on the principle of "independence and integrity of territory and sovereignty."</p>
<p>As long as we have an inch of territory under the enemy's iron hooves, and as long as we have some of our sovereignty in the hands of the enemy, this is not considered independence and integrity, and we will never talk about peace with the enemy.</p>
