<h3>邵力子廣播演講國民意識的進步（續）</h3>
<p>决定努力途徑益加奮發　認識國家民族賢明領袖</p>
<p>單從本人到中宣部服務三個多月以來、所主辦的幾件事業上看去、也可以證明國民意識的確進步、例如檢查新聞在過去有一部份認為是妨碍言論自由的人、現在都明白了、我所接見的新聞記者每個人都能認識到檢查是應該的、在新聞本身方面、可以袪除不正確消息的登載、增高報紙在社會上的信用、在國家民族前途可以防止無意中供給漢奸們、</p>
<p>造謠煽惑機會</p>
<p>實在在各方面都有需要、自然還有極少數人認識沒有這樣深刻、但是深信他們必能明白過來、為擁護國家民族的需要而犧牲個人成見的、又如全國文藝作家的意識、也很進步、一切不合國家民族需要的作品已漸漸减少、足以養成國民品格激揚民族精神的文字天天增多、文風的不變、最足以表示國民意識的亢進、話劇作家熊佛西先生、是大家聞名的、他所編著的賽金花劇本、準備在北平上演、臨時接到中央禁演命令、就停止了、我很欽佩他的犧牲精神、他當時對觀衆說、“我是中國人、我應當服從中國政府的命令、”熊先生這兩句話、眞足代表國民最正確的意識、那時熊先生趕速修改他的劇本、</p>
<p>送請中央審查</p>
<p>不久他到南京、我當面和他討論、提出了禁止賽金花劇本上演的理由、是不願意像賽金花那樣祇求瓦全的意識、影響到現代的國民、熊先生便慨然犧牲了他個人的咸見、這使我更加佩服、現在能够犧牲報國的聞人、自然不止熊先生一個、但是熊先生的意識、却可以代表全國進步的文人、我在上海電影同業聯合會開成立會的時候報告了這段經過、聽的人都很感動、賽金花劇本禁演這一問題、也再不看到社會不滿意的表示、從這一點上可以看出國民很明白維護民族、比欣賞文藝更重要、這意識是十分正確了、此外電影事業界對於國家民族的需要認識亦很淸楚、最近中宣部解决禁止粵語影片問題、所有經過情形、很足證明國民共同意識的進步、我們大家都知道粵語和國語太不相通、而粵語的勢力在兩廣和南洋一帶也實在不小、所以中央</p>
<p>為了統一國語</p>
<p>早有禁止攝製一切方言影片的决議、獨有粵語影片未能遵辦、最近因為七月一日起即須禁止攝製、廣州香港等處的電影商人、和其他商業團體、都向中央請願緩禁、這在廣東商人實在是有切膚的利害、中央也很諒解他們、但是統一國語這件事、對於我們國家的統一關係很大、所以廣東商人也沒有一個人從根本上反對統一國語、他們不但不反對、並且表示要在暫准攝製的粵語影片中間、輔助推行、</p>
<p>統一國語運動</p>
<p>這個問題便得到了滿意的解决、廣東本是革命的策源地、為了完成革命事業、使生命都犧牲掉的廣東同胞過去很多、現在為了完成國語的統一、以增進國家統一的力量、廣東電影商人能在維護本身利益之中、更尊重國家的利益、實在是很可贊許的、國民意識能從各方面這樣進步、是一個基本觀念為那裏推動的各人、知道自己是中華民國的國民、明白“民國”是人民的國家、“國民”是國家的人民、國家和人民永遠分離不開、要發展個人的權利、先要發展國家的權利、這個基本觀念便推動了一切事業、至於進步所以這樣的快、是由數國外患促成的、現在大家都已明白、要保護個人的權利、先要保護國家的權利、沒有國家就沒有個人、九一八以來的刺激、</p>
<p>便驚醒了全國</p>
<p>人民古人所說“殷憂啟聖、多難興邦、”可作國民意識所以進步的解釋、被人號稱“睡獅”的中國人、現在都驚醒了、我們對國家前途希望無窮的在此、我們在國際方面稍可慰藉的也在此、希望國內同跑更加努力、更加進步（三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>墨西哥農村建設的經騐</h3>
<p>— 李安宅</p>
<p>墨西哥，這是多麼遼遠的地名啊？國人對於墨西哥的印象，頂多也不過是好勇鬥狠，內亂頻仍的地方吧？</p>
<p>然而，我們也不難知道，不久以前，我們底國幣曾呌作“墨洋”，我們底華僑曾遭遇他們極嚴重的排斥。假如我要說，現在的墨西哥待我們底華僑並沒有歧視，對於我們底國家十分關心，而且有人因為同情於我們對於帝國主義的抗爭而受身體上的戕害，則我們要驚異地問：為甚麼？</p>
<p>為甚麼！因為墨西哥已經由着革命的破壞走到革命的建設，尤其是農村建設。“聯合以平等待我們的民族”是革命民族所有的普遍趨勢。這裏就是要簡單地討論一下墨西哥底革命經騐；這不但是因為我們要了解墨西哥，實在是因為墨西哥底經騐對於我們當前的問題有帮助。</p>
<p>個人認為社會科學在國內的任務，不管是純學術還是實用的，都要根據脚踏實地的學習。以學習的態度來應付實際的問題，日積月累，綜合為理論便是純科學，規劃成方案便是實用科學。同時，要將零星的經騐，貫串成綜合的智慧，又不能不靠觀察的技術與世界文化的遠近佈景。為了比較文化的佈景與研究文化的技術，個人曾跑到墨西哥與旁的地方。我們現在所要討論的墨西哥，就是根據實地觀察而來。</p>
<p>世界文明的發祥地，在新大陸有兩個中心。一個是古“馬牙”，一個是古“印迦”有人將印迦比作羅馬，將馬牙比作希臘；因為一人注重在政治組織，一個注重在藝術思想，印迦即現在秘魯，馬牙即現在墨西哥底一部。兩文明中心，都是印第安人底文明，而印第安人，則溯源於亞洲之黃種。（本無紅種，紅種即黃種）。</p>
<p>墨西哥底歷史可分四大時期：㊀由公元前五千年起，至西班牙滅墨西哥止，為原始期，以馬牙文化為最著；㊁由公元後一五一二年起，至一七○○年止，為西班牙殖民地時期；㊂由一八二一至一九一○年為脫西班牙而獨立時期，此時期內有法國的干涉，美國的侵犯；㊃由一九一○年即入革命政府時期，現任總統為迦顚拿斯，印第安人，一九三四年就職。</p>
<p>墨西哥革命，有兩個焦點，即㊀怎樣脫離外國帝國主義的羈絆？與㊁怎樣使耕者有其田？</p>
<p>墨西哥鑛產甚豐，歐洲的產業革命，大部原因，是受了西班牙輸入墨西哥白銀底推動。然而誰都知道，墨西哥底富源，成了“異族底乳母，墨西哥人底後娘”。</p>
<p>墨西哥底國土，前後損失給美國的，已超過墨境現有幅員十七萬方哩。因為高原峻嶺與熱帶荒蕪的緣故，現有七十六萬七千方哩的幅員，只有三十萬方哩可耕。</p>
<p>一七九○年，美國第一次有人口統計的時候，美墨兩國人口，實相等，均有五百萬。一九三○年，則美有一萬二千三百萬，墨有一千六百萬。墨境人口不旺的主要原因，即在可耕地太少。而少數可耕地，又一步一步集中在極少的地主手裏。</p>
<p>殖民地時期不必說，統治者分了可耕的地。獨立以後，也不過使地主換換國籍；所謂改革運動，又只是使地主換換姓名。所以到了革命前期，即迪阿斯獨裁，外國經濟侵略在“現代化”的名義下最得意的時候，百分之九十八的耕地，入了百分之二的人民手裏；致使有的省分，百分之九十八的人口無地可種。</p>
<p>一九一○年迪阿斯八十大慶，各國的王公大吏，富商巨賈，莫不麕集於墨京，因為他們底利益是被這個獨裁者底統治侍奉得那般好的。然而這樣窮極奢糜的慶祝，與無衣無食的羣衆相比，不啻一幅絕妙的圖畫，表現給任何有眼可見的人們：墨西哥政府是為了外人底利益，而不是為了墨西哥人底利益！墨西哥是想像豐富的民族，誰都看淸了這一點—據說少數統治者都恍然大悟了，連迪阿斯都恍然大悟了！於是屢伏屢起的革命，到這時方一發而不可遏，方一舉而成功。那就是馬呆如所領導的革命。</p>
<p>馬呆如是地主出身的闊公子，有理想，有情感，而不懂得經濟；作先知有餘，而作政治不足。他作了總統，攬了政權，就像一切“奴人政府”那樣，他必得仰仗他底朋友，原來作過官的人。官可以受賄，尤其外國帝國主義的賄，於是馬呆如便在美國外交官底陰謀之下，被他底朋友們殺了。繼他而起的，是他底武裝同志迦倫雜，便是成功了著名的一九一七年憲法大業的那一位。</p>
<p>迦倫雜知道外國帝國主義底厲害，所以他不在京城，而到各處去視察民間的飢苦。他一方面即見即行，給政府找到眞正民間的後盾，另一方面“車輪上的政府”，腐化貪污的勢力追隨不上，才會有出人意表的成功。現任總統迦顚拿斯，依然是多在民間，少在京城，未始不是抄了迦倫雜底法寶。</p>
<p>我們要知道：敵國絕不會坐視你建設起像樣的政府而絲毫不管的。這就是一切弱小民族不易有好政府的理由，這也解釋了墨西哥內戰所以那樣多，政府領袖所以起伏得那樣快。然而墨西哥究竟排百難而走到建設的時期了，這是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>根據一九一七年憲法二十七條，政府有强迫大地主出賣過大的不動產與有地主而任地荒蕪的土地的權力。政府收買的時候，是根據納賦稅所報的價額，並用農業債券。雖然債券有百分之五的利息，並在二十年以內淸償，可是納賦稅所報的地價，則是微乎其微的。這樣，政府可有大批土地，撥給無地可耕的老百姓。撥給百姓的時候，假如他們原有地是被大地主非法侵佔的，則取償還的方式；假如原來沒有土地，則取贈與的方式。這樣新興的農村，已不下萬數處。昨日為農奴，今日已為主人；昨日不得溫飽，今日已從事新國家的建設。看看這一羣老百姓，怎樣合作，怎樣創始，怎樣不自私，怎樣建設新文明，才使我們切實覺到羣衆的積極力量，才使我們恍然明白自私的惡德都是被壓迫產生出來的！不使羣衆有自新之路，徒罵他們自私，不愛國，才是知識份子衷心自私的表現！不然，試看墨西哥的成績。</p>
<p>革命以前，沒有人管佔人口三分之二的農民敎育，由一九二二年起，十四年之間，已將文盲的程度减至百分之五十九。這不但因為政府預算為敎育佔了百分之四十（我國佔百分之四弱！）實在因為政府為老百姓解决了民生問題！</p>
<p>墨國憲法，二十七條為農民，百二十三條則為勞工。勞工憲法，是墨西哥對於世界第一次的貢獻，可與法國憲章媲美。法國是人權宣言，墨西哥則是勞工權宣言。</p>
<p>根據勞工法，勞資兩方都有權利集會結社。工人罷工，只要不用武力，便算合法，資方便要付工資。工廠關閉，必經仲裁機關底許可，不能隨便使工人失業。假定勞工的待遇不合法律的規定，雖有勞資兩方的合同，也歸無效。這樣，墨西哥雖然不曾沒收外國的投資，也可利用工人的組織，慢慢使墨西哥底利益歸於墨西哥。外國利在他們政府底干涉，但有政府作後盾的墨西哥工人，好整以暇，外國不能處處干涉；可是每次勝利的總合，便可以加速獨立自主大業。去年夏天，親眼看見墨京電氣工人總罷工，總統正在鄕間，可是結果完全勝利，不能不恍然悟到政府底妙用。</p>
<p>墨西哥建設運動，關涉方面甚多，决非短文所可為功，本文目的，不過要使國人注意，有所借鏡而已。</p>
<h3>砲艦哨兵撤退日俄風雲消散</h3>
<p>黑龍江中島嶼主權誰屬　留待日後外交談判解决</p>
<p>［東京］日本駐蘇聯大使重光葵、一日午夜與蘇聯外交人民委員李維諾夫舉行第三次談話、激辯歷兩小時、雙方均以甘雀資島事件之責任互相歸諉、李維諾夫堅持同時撤兵、並宣稱、對擊沉砲艦保留要求賠償之權利、重光除表示已再度向政府請訓外、並未提出其他條件、今晨據莫斯科傳來最後消息、重光與李維諾夫二日下午舉行第四次談話、歷時約三十分鐘、結果關於撤兵問題、已告解决、據此間公怖、李維諾夫已同意立卽撤退派往該兩島之軍隊曁停泊附近之砲艦、因此過去數日來之緊張局勢、或可鬆彌、至關於邊界問題、則留待將來舉行外交談判以謀解决云、（二日中央社電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］本日日大使重光葵復訪李維諾夫氏、據稱、渠接到東京通知、日偽方面駐紥黑龍江、兩島附近之砲艦業已撤退、希望蘇方亦立卽撤退駐紥該處江面之砲艦及島上之哨兵、李氏當承認此與開始談判時渠所提出、復經昨日重申的建議相符、應允立卽與關係方面接治、以便頒發必要訓令、日大使繼詢此後是否可以恢復前此的局面、李氏答稱可以、並申述在雙方爭執各該島主權時、當維持過去局面、候鎮靜恢復後再加討論、日大使亦同意此後可以開始黑龍江劃界的談判、李氏更預測劃界時、可以决定兩島究屬何方、</p>

<p>［東京］蘇聯政府接受重光大使提議、對於撤兵事件表示同意、自外務省當局認為滿足、然出事地點恢復原狀之後、其歸屬問題尚待交涉、又蘇聯究以何種程度實行撤兵、現尚不許樂觀、</p>
<p>同時日本陸軍當局表示見解、認蘇聯之撤兵事態、不過復歸原狀而已、島嶼歸屬如何之問題、尚待解决、故未能謂完全圓滿解决、日本在今後亦以愼重態度注意事件之推移情形、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］日外務省今日根據駐莫斯科日大使重光葵之官報、宣布黑龍江甘雀資與齊南霍二島之爭案、已和平解决、佔據該二島之蘇聯軍隊內有巡船二十餘艘、聞已遵照重光葵與蘇聯外委李維諾夫商妥之辦法、於今日下午開始撤退、故關東軍已發表文告、對蘇聯顧全遠東和平撤退二島全數蘇軍、表示滿意、惟文中含有警告、謂日“滿”對於蘇聯侵犯“滿”境之同類行動、不能忍受云、此間各方面對此案和平解决、雖皆表示滿意、但觀察家皆謂二島之主權問題、仍應續事談判、蘇聯現方爭此二島主權、日“滿”當局則謂二島久屬“滿洲國”、此以“滿”民聚居所爭區域及上年蘇“滿”所訂黑河協定黑龍江航綫之燈塔八所、悉歸“滿”方維持、可為𨳐徵云、（中央社三日路透電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］此間外國人士、原均不信此次爭端、可引起日俄兩國間之公開衝突、蓋蘇聯深願在長時間內保持和平、而避免一切戰爭也、（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［東京］去年十二月間、日本政府曾施行匯兌管理修正法、其目的在防止國際貿易收支之過大逆勢、及便利軍事工業原料之輸入、現該法將於本月三十一日期滿、大藏省匯兌管理委員會昨日舉行幹事會、因鑒於本年入超之繼續增加、與日金匯兌率地位之嚴重、决定除將該法有效期延長至相當長時間外、並將該法條款加以强化、據該法規定在一個月期間任何超過三萬元之匯款、須獲得大藏省之許可、嗣後在一個月期間、任何匯款超過一千元者均須領許可證、關於此項規定、大藏省之正式命令將於下星期公佈、聞日本工商業資本家對於政府强化匯兌管理之政策、表示極度不安、日本在華經營實業者、已派代表向大藏陸軍商工與外務四省當局請願、要求對與日本在華工商資本家有關之事業、得免施行該管理法、同時東京商工會議所昨日亦呈請大藏省、免除對出口工業因輸入所需原料而購買外匯時施行同樣之限制、聞大藏省對此請求已予駁斥云、（三日中央社電）</p>

<h3>對德意建議英法表示難接受</h3>
<p>尤反對承認西交戰團體　不干涉小組會議陷停頓</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日下午不干涉委會小組委員會舉行會議時、樸萊茅斯勳爵宣稱、倘完全監察之計劃、無法擬定與成立、則以英政府目光觀之、不贊成諸國雖未使不干涉政策無以成在、亦已使感受極大困離云、今日小組會議之召集、擬對於談判之停頓草擬一通告稱、停頓之原因㊀德意兩國退出監察計劃後、其海上空隙擬由英法海軍填補之一節、意德兩國不贊成、㊁英法兩國不允以交戰國之權利、給與西班牙國民軍、此係意德所建議、而英法則恐因此使國民軍領袖弗朗哥獲得過分之優勢云、葡萄牙代表曾宣稱、倘英法計劃能為不干涉委員會全體贊成者、葡政府亦願接受之云、其餘諸國召比利時•瑞典•捷克•及蘇俄均已同意於英法計劃、葡代表並請求對於意德之建議予以愼重之考慮、惟英政府則認意德之建議為不可接受、法代表里賓特羅甫則不承認西班牙國民軍取得交戰團體利權後、卽可取得優越地位、並稱、德國並無袒護國民軍而使政府軍蒙受不利之企圖云、惟德國對於陸地上監察計劃德國視察員參加一節、則願加以好意之考慮云、小組委員會經過二小時餘之討論後、卽行休會、現有之新局面將留待下星期召集之全體會議討論之云、（中央社二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英法當局力圖打破西班牙內戰不干涉委員會之僵局、今日已决定對德•意•採取有力行動、要求全體委員會於下星期開會、討論最後辦法、英外相艾登今日對下院宣稱、不干涉委員會若告瓦解、將造成一種新局勢、其性質如何、目下尚不能預言、蘇俄駐英大使梅思基今日在不干涉委員會小組委員會宣稱、西班牙內戰、事實上已變成國際戰爭、外交界相信、波羅的海沿岸各國•斯干的那維亞各國•小協約各國•及比荷等國均將擁護英法建議、而葡代表已奉令不反對英法主張云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］關於西內亂不干涉辦法、德意兩國已表示拒絕英法兩國所提出西海面之新監察計劃、且提出對案、主張承認西內戰當事雙方為交戰團體、負責方面人士頃就此事、發表意見、謂德意兩國所要求承認交戰團體一層、法國將切實加以反對、蓋此項辦法僅於西班牙國民軍有利也、負責方面復指出德意兩國此項對案、不啻主張廢除國際監察制度、而由西內戰當事雙方實行封鎖以資替代、但按照國際法、海軍封鎖必須實施有效、方可由第三國加以承認、此在西內戰當事雙方則均無實施封鎖之能力、且此種封鎖辦法、足以引起極危險之事端、而於法國與北非洲之交通、影響尤為鉅大、自非法國所能接受、又一般人以為葡政府現已拒絕英國視察員庚續在西葡兩國邊境實施監察、以故法國亦不能容許比拉紐斯山法西兩國邊境、庚續實施監察、</p>
<p>至於英法兩國業已决定作最大努力、以維持不干涉原則及監察辦法、但仍當保留對於西班牙事件所採取之立塲有重加考慮之自由、蓋若上項努力竟歸失敗、則英法兩國自當恢復其自由行動也、此在法國根據上項態度、並已表示决心、務當保持本國尊嚴、曁有關生存之利益、不令受人侵犯、同時對於任何舉動、凡足以增加國際嚴重局勢者亦當力求避免之、總之、西班牙內部因理論不同而自相分裂、法國自不願加以干預、但若德意兩國植其勢力於西班牙及地中海、並謀切斷英法兩國之海上交通道路、則亦斷非法國所能接受者也、（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>小城中</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>踏着乾燙的黃泥地，趕了整天的路程，到這時才感到一陣輕鬆，悄悄地對自己說道：“呵，到了，這古老的小城。”</p>
<p>水樣的黃昏像被風吹縐的波紋似的，鼠色的暗影隱隱飛上城樓的簷角了。沉藍的天空，已消失了太陽最末一閃的紅光，暮色伴着哀啼的烏鴉，在稀疏的星辰下，迎接那夜的降臨。</p>
<p>整了整背上的行囊和雨傘，跨過護城河的小石橋，岩洞樣的城門，幽黑的，像匹吃人的怪獸正大張了口，等待着什麼。虫蝕了的厚木門邊，兩個灰軍裝面色蒼黃的兵士守着崗位，他們用尖銳的眼睛，向我這流浪漢疑惑的端詳着，有一个裝得很威嚴的問：</p>
<p>“嘿，小舅子，打那兒來？”</p>
<p>沒等我回答這個野蠻傢伙，一個肩胛上斜披紅縧帶的漢子便走來搜查我的包袱，那被汗漬和灰塵浸硬了的衫褲，給晚風飄出來股發霉的氣味，這漢子厭煩的揚揚手，我很慊然的笑了笑，走進這座頹敗的小城。</p>
<p>街道是狹隘的，誰家的屋簷下常撤點糞溺，迎面吹起一片窘臭的風，兩旁的小商店都掛起大减價的市招，從南面的橫街上，跑來十幾匹黑毛大耳的肥猪，牠們用鏟子般的嘴在街道的垃圾堆上擺來擺去，跟到後面的猪販子抽打着皮鞭，被被追趕的跑過去，灰塵也像炊烟似的，飛騰到天堂上再慢慢地落下。</p>
<p>一個破鞋狗皮換竹籃的販子怪聲的吆喚了聲，巷口的幾條野狗就不息的汪汪起來。</p>
<p>在掛着一雙紅紙燈籠的“來福棧”門前，我被一個堂倌接去了行李，他不由我分說什麼，竟一直拉我進了一個滿是牲口跟大車的院子，他扯起一間泥坯東房的布門簾，油滑的笑着說：</p>
<p>“先生你看看，全縣城你能找着比咱這兒再好的房子，那我算哄爹。”</p>
<p>我點點頭住了這間房子，當我把被褥打開，鋪到那發黃的潮濕的蓆上，那堂倌提一把灰泥瓦壺放在窗台，等我疲倦的躺下身，他低低的凑到我臉前說：</p>
<p>“你先生不解解悶，雖說是土貨，可幹凈咧！我呌兩個來讓你瞅瞅，小意</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>思。”</p>
<p>“我擺擺手，他翻着白眼珠停下，依然是不放鬆的。”</p>
<p>“先生你要是累了，我給你揣燈去，先解解乏，真正西口土。”</p>
<p>我一切都使他失了望，他近於憤怒的撲的聲放下門簾，走到院中嘴里還咕嚕着：“好扣的傢伙”！</p>
<p>這小城古舊得要崩潰了，她正像一個生了蛆的菓子，打核心里一點點向外腐爛。……</p>
<h3>蔭</h3>
<p>— 申氷</p>
<p>陽光燃于日午之心。我在樹蔭下尋求光和熱的泉源，一如從傘下尋求飄過眼前的雨點。昧於過往的記憶，覺得棕黑的膚色蒼白了，豐秀的毛髮，光禿了，而且患了難以療瘉的貧血症。</p>
<p>老樹的氣根流蘇般地垂着，平行，參差。在長盛的日午，靜靜地做了一片蔭。它圈圍着我，冷壓着跳躍的生命。彷彿覺得我是一個被囚的人，而脚踝那裏無端地一條鐵鏈墜着。</p>
<p>透過茂密的樹，我拾得陽光的點綫如只殼。但樹影飄搖，我尋求光和熱，乃手獲蔭影和水冷。那些日月的輪廻，參商的隱現，那朝和夕，枯和榮，在我無所知亦無所得。世界沉泯於暮天裏，無所希求，如停留在和平中。我發出無聲的怨言，恍如一縷黑霧，沒人黑霧的長空。我在尋求光與熱的泉源。</p>
<p>於是我開始迷茫的跋涉。我已經在追求光和熱。從來未曾回顧自己的足印，也未曾從眼皮上擦去一點淚水。憑着棕黑了的膚色和豐秀了的毛髪作證，我追求光和熱。</p>
<p>我再不像壁虎和蛇那麼冰冷，血液重新在血管裏跳躍起來，則我的笑也是健康的，在充滿着光和熱的陽光下。</p>
<p>有時我會在賣卜攤上擺下幾個戲謔的錢，會抓着一個老瞎子糾纏着，要知道我的光和熱，在很遠的遠方，或是已擺在我的眼前，憑着棕黑了的膚色和豐秀了的毛髪作證。</p>
<p>一顆星火在我的眼前閃耀着，輝散着重疊的光，彷彿是那麼近，近在我的眼前。疲乏的旅人不該疑訝，延遲，為的是那一星星的火光；但那星點却是迢遙的，迢遙地燃在遠方，而咫近地閃耀在眼前。</p>
<p>生命永恒跋涉於崎嶇的途中，憑着那誘惑的星火。</p>
<p>我覺得餒志。那些光和熱，那些希望和期待，生命和跳躍的血，我無所得。我贏得的乃是滿手的灰燼。</p>
<p>彷彿還是昨日的事；六月的風吹過叔寂的庭院，陽光的觸手撫摸着檐椽，會有闌干玲瓏的影，描在陽光裏。在這樣的日子裏，我開始了生命的第一天。</p>
<p>彷彿還是昨日的事；我背着書包，滿面紅光，擠到小小的生命羣裏，習見那些重重疊疊的背脊，　牛似地走向學堂。</p>
<p>彷彿還是昨日的事；我沒有把手指放在嘴裏啃着。我有牙齒，我有口味，看見從身畔　繂過去的女孩子，便像風箱似地喘息起來。我為鬢脚，眉毛和腰肢做過纏綿的情詩。</p>
<p>彷彿還是昨日的事；但昨日是去得那麼遠那麼遠了。</p>
<p>二十歲的生日就是今天。作為生日的禮物，父親與母親迢迢地寄來了兩個包裹。我鄭重地分別解開。</p>
<p>在精緻的匣子裏躺着一只精緻的小手錶另外是一張違犯包裹投寄法則的小紙條，寫着：</p>
<p>“孩子，愛惜這小手錶吧！珍守你的時間”。</p>
<p>興奮使我打開第二個包裹，父親送給我的竟是一只粗劣的指南針。我迷茫地看着發顫的磁針。</p>
<p>“留心方向！”</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Arrives in Beijing to Discuss Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>▲Claims No Intention to Initiate Negotiations ▲Do Not Allow New Disputes to Arise Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, accompanied by Secretary Shimizu, arrived in Beijing on an early express train from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd, arriving at Xiaguan Station at 3:00 PM. Noburo Hidaka, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, and many others were at the station to greet them.

It is undecided whether he will go to Lushan. It is also reported that Noburo Hidaka, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, is scheduled to go to Lushan in the near future. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After arriving in Beijing from Shanghai on the 3rd, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru gave a statement to Japanese newspaper reporters stationed in Beijing at the Japanese Embassy at 5:00 PM regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. It is reported that the general idea was that, according to general observations, the current situation is not suitable for starting negotiations, whether on the Chinese or Japanese side. However, it is my intention (the Japanese ambassador referring to himself) that the responsible officials of the two governments must work to ease this situation so that the relations between the two countries can be adjusted. At the same time, in a passive sense, we must pay particular attention to preventing new disputes from arising between the two countries. Although this is my personal opinion, it can also be said to be the policy of the Japanese government. The National Government probably has the same view on this. Because key figures in the National Government, such as Foreign Minister Wang, are mostly in Lushan now, I have no intention of immediately requesting the Chinese side to start negotiations on adjusting relations. However, all diplomatic events that are matters of routine will naturally be handled with effort, so as to resolve them as soon as possible within the possible scope. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Maintains Shantou Merchant Warehouse Certificate Measures</h3>
<p>Organize Reorganization Committee to Take Over Warehouse Certificate Collateral, Limit Certificate Holders to Repay Monthly and Recover Certificates</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Shantou Merchant Warehouse Certificates were issued by the Shantou Merchant Warehouse Certificate Issuance Association, which was formed by various merchants in Shantou in 1934. The total amount issued was eight million yuan. Merchants who used these warehouse certificates were required to use real estate as collateral. At that time, the market was depressed, and shops were short of capital, so they used real estate as collateral to obtain warehouse certificates for turnover. However, eighteen months after the issuance of the warehouse certificates, the merchants were unable to raise funds to recover and close them. The government approved two extensions, each for six months, but the warehouse certificates are still circulating on the market and have not been recovered, so the credit has gradually deteriorated. Therefore, when a financial crisis occurs, it is the first to be affected by low discounts. This time, Guangdong Province reformed the currency system, and the ratio of Guangdong banknotes to national currency was re-determined to be an additional 144. However, because the Shantou warehouse certificates were not ordered to stipulate the ratio, certificate holders became worried, and the exchange rate fell sharply to over twenty yuan. Some merchants even refused to accept them. The Shantou Chamber of Commerce, the Exchange Industry Association, the Overseas Chinese Wholesale Industry Association, and the Shantou Municipal Government repeatedly telegraphed the Department of Finance to ask for a solution. In addition to telegraphing the Mayor of Shantou on the 25th of this month to issue a notice to the people to continue to use the warehouse certificates as usual and not to allow discounts, the Department of Finance also drafted measures to maintain the certificates and submitted them to the Provincial Council for approval. The measures are divided into three items: 1. Announce that the warehouse certificates will continue to be used as usual, 2. Prohibit unscrupulous merchants from speculating and manipulating, 3. Reorganize the original Japanese Merchant Warehouse Certificate Issuance Committee and the Merchant Warehouse Certificate Supervision Committee into the Shantou Municipal Merchant Warehouse Certificate Reorganization Committee, with the Mayor of Shantou, the Manager of the Central Bank Branch, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Managers of the Shantou Branches, the Chairman of the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, the Chairman of the Shantou Exchange Association, and the Chairman of the Shantou Silver Industry Association serving as members of the Reorganization Committee. The Reorganization Committee will first take over the original collateral from each store that obtained the certificates from the Merchant Warehouse Certificate Issuance Association and supervise the stores to repay the loans and surrender the certificates for cancellation. The repayment method will follow the regulations set by the Ministry, limiting the users of the warehouse certificates to repay one-tenth of the loan each month, handing it over to the Reorganization Committee to recover 10% of the issued amount, until all the loans are repaid. If the ten-month deadline is exceeded, the collateral assets of each store will be auctioned off to repay the loans as a priority, and if there is insufficient funds, strict recovery and liquidation will be pursued.

The important mission of this National Assembly is to pass the constitution; there are no rights to be fought for. Therefore, in the previous national women's vigorous campaign to elect representatives, the intention to participate in constitution-making was purely to fulfill citizens' obligations. However, the initial election results yielded only twenty-nine people, and after the re-election, they are bound to fail entirely. The reason for this is not that women are not making efforts or willingly giving up, but it is actually caused by thousands of years of oppression. They feel weak both politically and economically, and customs are difficult to change, thus causing two hundred million female compatriots to have the heart to save the country but no way to be loyal. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene, in what way should we female citizens ask the central government to grant us the opportunity to participate in constitution-making? This is one of the important meanings of holding this Representatives Conference. Secondly, how should we women improve ourselves in the future? How should we enrich our political knowledge? How should we train our ability to participate in politics? Furthermore, due to the evolution of the national environment, how should the Chinese women's movement transform its policies in the future in order to liberate the entire nation? This is the significant meaning of holding the Representatives Conference. (Omission)... At this critical moment of national peril, the members of this conference have gathered in the capital for three days to discuss the past and encourage the future, deeply feeling that our women's community should earnestly work on the task of saving the country. Therefore, the following working principles are formulated: ㊀ Support the government and complete the constitution-making movement. ㊁ Support the Central Kuomintang and lead the national revival movement. ㊂ Strive for citizens' duties in order to obtain the civil rights that should be enjoyed. Be sure to actively participate in the re-election of National Assembly representatives. For designated representatives, we should adhere to standard principles and strive for quotas. ㊃ Promote new movements and strengthen the body and mind. ㊄ Assist rural women and promote vocational education, use domestic goods, and promote national economic construction. ㊅ Serve various social relief undertakings, especially focusing on the education and upbringing of poor children to cultivate national strength. The above six items are brief and not detailed. It is hoped that our female compatriots throughout the country will adhere to these principles, strengthen their will, sincerely unite, improve organizations, work hard, independently seek the implementation of women's liberation, and complete the great cause of saving and building the country. It is also hoped that the media will provide guidance so that female compatriots can fulfill this sacred obligation for the country and the nation. This is our declaration. July 3, the 26th year of the Republic of China (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi's Radio Speech on the Progress of National Consciousness (Continued)</h3>
<p>Determined to Work Harder - Recognizing the Nation's Wise Leaders</p>
<p>Judging solely from the several undertakings that I have managed since I came to serve at the Central Propaganda Department for more than three months, one can also prove that national consciousness has indeed progressed. For example, in the past, some people considered the censorship of news to be an obstruction of freedom of speech, but now they all understand. Every journalist I have met can recognize that censorship is necessary. In terms of the news itself, it can eliminate the publication of incorrect news, increase the credibility of newspapers in society, and prevent unintentional supply to traitors in the future of the nation.</p>
<p>Opportunity to Spread Rumors and Incitement</p>
<p>In fact, there are needs in all aspects. Naturally, there are still a very small number of people who do not have such a deep understanding, but I firmly believe that they will surely understand and sacrifice personal prejudices for the sake of upholding the needs of the nation. Furthermore, the consciousness of literary writers across the country has also progressed greatly. All works that do not meet the needs of the nation have gradually decreased, and articles that are sufficient to cultivate national character and promote the national spirit are increasing every day. The unchanging style of writing is most sufficient to express the advancement of national consciousness. Playwright Mr. Xiong Foxi is well-known to everyone. The Sai Jinhua script he wrote was prepared to be staged in Beiping. Upon temporarily receiving an order from the Central Government to ban the performance, he stopped it. I greatly admire his spirit of sacrifice. He said to the audience at the time, "I am Chinese, and I should obey the orders of the Chinese government." These two sentences by Mr. Xiong truly represent the most correct consciousness of the people. At that time, Mr. Xiong quickly revised his script</p>
<p>Submitted to the Central Government for Review</p>
<p>Soon he went to Nanjing, and I discussed with him in person and put forward the reasons for prohibiting the performance of the Sai Jinhua script, which was that I did not want the consciousness of seeking complete preservation like Sai Jinhua to affect modern people. Mr. Xiong generously sacrificed his personal insights, which made me admire him even more. Now, there are naturally more than just Mr. Xiong who are able to sacrifice to serve the country, but Mr. Xiong's consciousness can represent the progressive literati of the whole country. I reported this experience when the Shanghai Film Industry Association held its founding meeting, and everyone who heard it was very moved. The issue of banning the Sai Jinhua script was no longer seen as a social expression of dissatisfaction. From this point, it can be seen that the people understand that safeguarding the nation is more important than appreciating literature and art, and this consciousness is very correct. In addition, the film industry's recognition of the needs of the nation is also very clear. Recently, the Central Propaganda Department resolved the problem of banning Cantonese films, and all the circumstances of the process are sufficient to prove the progress of the common consciousness of the people. We all know that Cantonese and Mandarin are too different, and the power of Cantonese is indeed not small in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Southeast Asia. Therefore, the Central Government</p>
<p>In order to Unify the National Language</p>
<p>There has long been a resolution to prohibit the production of all dialect films. However, Cantonese films have not been able to comply. Recently, because the ban on production must be implemented from July 1, film merchants in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other commercial groups have petitioned the Central Government to postpone the ban. This is a very personal interest for Guangdong merchants, and the Central Government also understands them very well. However, the unification of the national language is very important for the unification of our country, so not a single Guangdong merchant fundamentally opposed the unification of the national language. Not only did they not oppose it, but they also expressed their intention to assist in promoting it among the Cantonese films that are temporarily allowed to be produced,</p>
<p>Unified National Language Movement</p>
<p>This problem was satisfactorily resolved. Guangdong was originally the cradle of the revolution. In the past, many Guangdong compatriots sacrificed their lives to complete the revolutionary cause. Now, in order to complete the unification of the national language and increase the strength of national unity, Guangdong film merchants can be commended for respecting the interests of the country even more while safeguarding their own interests. The reason why the national consciousness can progress in this way in all aspects is that a basic concept has driven each person, knowing that they are a citizen of the Republic of China, understanding that "Republic" is the people's country, and "citizen" is the people of the country. The country and the people are forever inseparable. To develop individual rights, we must first develop the rights of the country. This basic concept has driven all undertakings. As for why progress is so fast, it is promoted by several foreign invasions. Now everyone understands that to protect individual rights, we must first protect the rights of the country. Without a country, there is no individual. The stimulus since September 18th</p>
<p>Awakened the Whole Country</p>
<p>People. The ancients said, "Adversity reveals sages, and hardship revives the nation." It can be used as an explanation for the progress of national consciousness. The Chinese people, who were nicknamed "sleeping lions," have now all awakened. Our hope for the future of the country is boundless here, and our consolation in the international arena is also here. I hope that domestic colleagues will work harder and make more progress. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>The Experience of Rural Construction in Mexico</h3>
<p>— Li Anzhai</p>
<p>Mexico, what a distant place name! The impression that Chinese people have of Mexico is, at most, a place of bravery and constant internal strife, right?</p>
<p>However, we also know that not long ago, our national currency was called "Mexican dollar," and our overseas Chinese encountered their extremely serious exclusion. If I were to say that the current Mexico does not discriminate against our overseas Chinese, is very concerned about our country, and that some people have suffered physical harm because they sympathize with our resistance to imperialism, then we would ask in amazement: Why?</p>
<p>Why! Because Mexico has gone from the destruction of revolution to the construction of revolution, especially rural construction. "Uniting with nations that treat us equally" is the universal trend of revolutionary nations. Here, I want to briefly discuss Mexico's revolutionary experience; this is not only because we want to understand Mexico, but also because Mexico's experience is helpful to our current problems.</p>
<p>I personally believe that the task of social sciences in the country, whether purely academic or practical, should be based on down-to-earth learning. Dealing with practical problems with a learning attitude, accumulating over time, synthesizing into theory is pure science, and planning into a plan is practical science. At the same time, to string together fragmented experiences into comprehensive wisdom, one cannot but rely on the technique of observation and the background of world culture. In order to compare the background of culture and the technique of studying culture, I went to Mexico and other places. The Mexico we are going to discuss now is based on field observation.</p>
<p>The cradle of world civilization has two centers in the New World. One is ancient "Maya" and the other is ancient "Inca". Some people compare Inca to Rome and Maya to Greece; because one focuses on political organization and the other focuses on art and thought. Inca is now Peru, and Maya is now part of Mexico. Both civilization centers are civilizations of the Indians, and the Indians trace their origins to the yellow race of Asia. (There is no red race, the red race is the yellow race).</p>
<p>The history of Mexico can be divided into four major periods: ㊀ From 5000 BC to the Spanish destruction of Mexico, it was the primitive period, with Maya culture being the most prominent; ㊁ From 1512 AD to 1700 AD, it was the Spanish colonial period; ㊂ From 1821 to 1910, it was the period of independence from Spain, during which there was French intervention and American invasion; ㊃ From 1910, it entered the revolutionary government period, and the current president is Cárdenas, an Indian, who took office in 1934.</p>
<p>The Mexican Revolution has two focuses: ㊀ How to get rid of the shackles of foreign imperialism? And ㊁ How to enable farmers to have their own land?</p>
<p>Mexico has abundant mineral resources. The industrial revolution in Europe was largely driven by the import of Mexican silver by Spain. However, everyone knows that Mexico's wealth has become "a wet nurse to foreign races and a stepmother to Mexicans."</p>
<p>The land that Mexico has lost to the United States before and after has exceeded the existing area of ​​Mexico by 170,000 square miles. Due to the high mountains and tropical wilderness, only 300,000 square miles of the existing 767,000 square miles are arable.</p>
<p>In 1790, when the United States had its first census, the populations of the United States and Mexico were actually equal, both with 5 million. In 1930, the United States had 123 million, and Mexico had 16 million. The main reason for the slow population growth in Mexico is that there is too little arable land. And the few arable lands are gradually concentrated in the hands of very few landlords.</p>
<p>Needless to say, during the colonial period, the rulers divided the arable land. After independence, it only made the landlords change their nationality; the so-called reform movement only made the landlords change their names. Therefore, in the early stage of the revolution, that is, during the dictatorship of Diaz, when foreign economic invasion was most successful under the name of "modernization," 98% of the arable land fell into the hands of 2% of the people; resulting in some provinces where 98% of the population had no land to cultivate.</p>
<p>When Diaz celebrated his 80th birthday in 1910, kings, princes, wealthy merchants, and magnates from all countries flocked to Mexico City, because their interests were served so well by the rule of this dictator. However, such an extremely extravagant celebration, compared with the crowds without clothes and food, is nothing but a wonderful picture, showing to anyone with eyes to see: the Mexican government is for the benefit of foreigners, not for the benefit of Mexicans! Mexico is a nation with a rich imagination, and everyone saw this clearly—it is said that the minority rulers were all suddenly enlightened, even Diaz was suddenly enlightened! Therefore, the revolution, which had been rising and falling repeatedly, could not be suppressed at this time, and it succeeded in one fell swoop. That was the revolution led by Madero.</p>
<p>Madero was a wealthy young man from a landlord family, with ideals and emotions, but did not understand economics; he was more than enough as a prophet, but not enough as a politician. When he became president and seized power, like all "slave governments," he had to rely on his friends, people who had originally been officials. Officials can be bribed, especially by foreign imperialists, so Madero was killed by his friends under the conspiracy of the American diplomats. He was succeeded by his armed comrade Carranza, who succeeded in the famous 1917 Constitution.</p>
<p>Carranza knew the power of foreign imperialism, so he did not stay in the capital, but went to various places to inspect the hunger and suffering of the people. On the one hand, he acted immediately upon seeing the suffering, and found a real backing for the government among the people. On the other hand, the "government on wheels" made it impossible for the forces of corruption and bribery to keep up, so there was unexpected success. The current president, Cárdenas, is still more among the people and less in the capital. It may not be that he copied Carranza's magic weapon.</p>
<p>We must know: the enemy country will never sit idly by and watch you build a decent government without doing anything. This is the reason why it is not easy for all small and weak nations to have a good government, which also explains why there were so many civil wars in Mexico and why government leaders rose and fell so quickly. However, Mexico has finally overcome all difficulties and entered a period of construction, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>According to Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution, the government has the power to force large landowners to sell excessively large real estate and land that is owned by landowners but is left barren. When the government buys, it is based on the value reported for tax payment, and agricultural bonds are used. Although the bonds have an interest rate of 5% and are paid off within 20 years, the land price reported for tax payment is negligible. In this way, the government can have a large amount of land to allocate to the common people who have no land to cultivate. When allocating to the people, if their original land was illegally occupied by large landlords, it will be taken back in the form of compensation; if they originally had no land, it will be taken back in the form of a gift. Such newly emerging villages are no less than tens of thousands. Yesterday they were serfs, today they are masters; yesterday they could not get enough to eat, today they are engaged in the construction of a new country. Seeing how these people cooperate, how they start, how selfless they are, and how they build a new civilization, makes us truly realize the active power of the masses, and makes us realize that the evils of selfishness are all produced by oppression! Not allowing the masses to have a way to renew themselves, and scolding them for being selfish and unpatriotic, is the sincere and selfish expression of intellectuals! If not, look at Mexico's achievements.</p>
<p>Before the revolution, no one cared about the education of farmers, who accounted for two-thirds of the population. From 1922, in 14 years, the illiteracy rate has been reduced to 59%. This is not only because the government's budget for education accounts for 40% (my country accounts for less than 4%!), but because the government has solved the livelihood problems of the people!</p>
<p>In the Mexican Constitution, Article 27 is for farmers, and Article 123 is for laborers. The Labor Constitution is Mexico's first contribution to the world, comparable to the French Charter. France is the Declaration of Human Rights, and Mexico is the Declaration of Labor Rights.</p>
<p>According to the Labor Law, both labor and management have the right to assemble and form associations. Workers' strikes are considered legal as long as they do not use force, and management must pay wages. Factories must be closed with the permission of the arbitration agency and cannot arbitrarily cause workers to lose their jobs. Assuming that the treatment of workers does not comply with legal regulations, even if there is a contract between labor and management, it will be invalid. In this way, although Mexico has not confiscated foreign investment, it can use the organization of workers to slowly make Mexico's interests belong to Mexico. Foreign countries benefit from the intervention of their governments, but with the Mexican workers backed by the government, they can wait at leisure, and foreign countries cannot intervene everywhere; but the sum of each victory can accelerate the cause of independence and autonomy. Last summer, I personally saw the general strike of electrical workers in Mexico City. The president was in the countryside, but the result was a complete victory. One cannot help but realize the wonderful use of the government.</p>
<p>The Mexican construction movement involves many aspects, which cannot be accomplished by a short article. The purpose of this article is only to make Chinese people pay attention and learn from it.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal of Gunboat Sentries, Dissipation of Russo-Japanese Tensions</h3>
<p>Sovereignty Over Islands in the Heilongjiang River: To Be Resolved Through Future Diplomatic Negotiations</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mamoru Shigemitsu, held a third conversation with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, at midnight on the 1st.  The intense debate lasted two hours, with both sides mutually blaming each other for the incident on Kanatzuza Island. Litvinov insisted on simultaneous troop withdrawal and declared that he reserved the right to demand compensation for the sinking of the gunboat. Shigemitsu, in addition to stating that he had again sought instructions from his government, did not propose other conditions.  According to the latest news from Moscow this morning, Shigemitsu and Litvinov held a fourth conversation on the afternoon of the 2nd, lasting approximately thirty minutes.  As a result, the issue of troop withdrawal has been resolved.  According to an announcement here, Litvinov has agreed to immediately withdraw the troops sent to the two islands and the gunboats stationed nearby. Therefore, the tense situation of the past few days may be eased.  As for the border issue, it will be left to future diplomatic negotiations for resolution. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu visited Mr. Litvinov again.  It is reported that he received notification from Tokyo that the gunboats stationed near the two islands in the Heilongjiang River by the Japanese puppet regime have already withdrawn.  He hoped that the Soviet side would also immediately withdraw the gunboats stationed on the river and the sentries on the islands.  Mr. Litvinov acknowledged that this was consistent with the proposal he made at the beginning of the negotiations and reiterated yesterday.  He promised to immediately contact the relevant parties to issue the necessary instructions. The Japanese ambassador then inquired whether it would be possible to restore the previous situation.  Mr. Litvinov replied that it was possible and stated that while the two sides were disputing the sovereignty of the islands, the past situation should be maintained, and discussions should be resumed after calm was restored.  The Japanese ambassador also agreed that negotiations on the demarcation of the Heilongjiang River could begin thereafter.  Mr. Litvinov further predicted that the demarcation could determine to whom the two islands belonged.</p>
<p>According to the results of the above negotiations, the Soviet Defense Committee immediately issued an order on the same day to withdraw the gunboats stationed near the islands and the troops stationed on the islands. (TASS dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Changchun] The Soviet troops stationed on Kanatzuza and Chinanho Islands, and the Soviet fleet of more than 20 ships concentrated near the two islands, began to withdraw on the afternoon of the 3rd, according to the convention of the Shigemitsu-Litvinov meeting on the 2nd. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Changchun] Soviet troops have begun to withdraw from Kanatzuza and Chinanho Islands.  At 6:00 PM on the 3rd, the "Manchukuo" side specially ordered the North Manchurian Special Envoy of the Foreign Affairs Bureau to notify the Soviet government that "Manchukuo" would dispatch officials from the Maritime Affairs Bureau to be stationed on the two islands. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government accepted Ambassador Shigemitsu's proposal and expressed agreement on the troop withdrawal. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs authorities consider this satisfactory. However, after the incident site is restored to its original state, the issue of its ownership still needs to be negotiated. Furthermore, the extent to which the Soviet Union will implement the withdrawal is not yet cause for optimism.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese Army authorities expressed their views, believing that the Soviet troop withdrawal was merely a return to the original state. The issue of the island's sovereignty still needs to be resolved, so it cannot be said to be a completely satisfactory resolution. Japan will continue to pay close attention to the development of the situation with a cautious attitude. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Based on the official report from the Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, Mamoru Shigemitsu, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today announced that the dispute over Kanatzuza and Chinanho Islands in the Heilongjiang River has been peacefully resolved. The Soviet troops occupying the two islands, including more than 20 patrol boats, are said to have begun withdrawing this afternoon in accordance with the methods agreed upon by Shigemitsu and the Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. Therefore, the Kwantung Army has issued a statement expressing satisfaction with the Soviet Union's consideration for the peace of the Far East and the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from the two islands. However, the statement contained a warning that Japan and "Manchukuo" cannot tolerate similar actions by the Soviet Union that infringe upon the "Manchukuo" territory. Although all parties here have expressed satisfaction with the peaceful resolution of this case, observers all say that the issue of sovereignty over the two islands should continue to be negotiated. The Soviet Union is currently disputing the sovereignty of these two islands, while the Japanese and "Manchukuo" authorities claim that the two islands have long belonged to "Manchukuo." This can be evidenced by the fact that the area inhabited by "Manchu" people and the eight lighthouses on the Heilongjiang River route stipulated in the Heilongjiang River Agreement signed between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" last year are all maintained by the "Manchukuo" side. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Foreigners here generally do not believe that this dispute could lead to open conflict between Japan and Russia, as the Soviet Union deeply desires to maintain peace for a long time and avoid all wars. (Havas dispatch from the 2nd, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Female Aviator Disappears Suddenly Over the Pacific Ocean During Round-the-World Flight</h3>
<p>Radioed for Help After Running Out of Fuel Mid-Flight; American Cruisers Search in All Directions, But Still No News</p>
<p>[New York] The American aviator, Amelia Earhart, who, together with her pilot, Noonan, flew out from the United States on June 1st to make a round-the-world flight, has suddenly disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. After arriving at Lae, New Guinea on the 29th of last month, they flew towards Howland Island, 2,550 miles from Honolulu, but unexpectedly disappeared mid-flight, and it is feared that they have crashed into the sea. Their aircraft is not equipped with flotation devices, so the lives of the two aviators are increasingly worrying. At 8:12 PM last night (Greenwich Mean Time, which is 4:12 AM Shanghai time), a radio message was received from Ms. Earhart, stating that they only had enough fuel for half an hour of flight and had not yet seen land. According to reports, Ms. Earhart was only about 100 miles from Howland Island an hour before sending this message. The cruiser "Itasca," stationed on the island, sailed out to search upon hearing the news, but had not yet seen the aircraft's traces when the message was sent. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[New York] According to a broadcast telegram from Honolulu, the missing American aviator, Ms. Amelia Earhart, and Noonan have been rescued by a British ship. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙Los Angeles: After investigating the news of the rescue of the missing aviators transmitted by radio, the US Navy personnel stationed in Honolulu pointed out that this was an unfounded rumor. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] After the news of the disappearance of the beautiful aviator Amelia Earhart was released, the commander of the Honolulu harbor fortress has been ordered to dispatch multiple destroyers and about 20 bombers to search in all directions. As of now, no traces of the lady have been found. The Coast Guard authorities recently announced that, based on the capabilities of the aircraft Ms. Earhart was flying, it would have been unable to continue flying until 8:10 PM last night (Greenwich Mean Time). Once it crashes on the sea surface, it will be difficult to float for a long time because the aircraft body is made entirely of metal products. This is according to what the aircraft manufacturer said, that the aircraft's fuel tank is tightly sealed and will not leak water, and the aircraft body can float on the water surface without fear of sinking. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] According to Putnam, the husband of Ms. Amelia Earhart, who is a famous publisher, he has recently announced that his wife's aircraft is equipped with rockets and kites, which can be used as warning signals in case of danger, and the aircraft also stores dry food for emergencies, so there is no need to worry. At this time, the weather near Howland Island is clear, the visibility is good, and the waves are calm. According to aviation experts, Ms. Earhart may have flown past the north of Howland Island. Here is a list of the places the aircraft has passed along the way since its departure on June 1st:</p>
<p>June 1st: Departed from Miami, Florida.</p>
<p>June 3rd: Arrived in Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana colony.</p>
<p>June 6th: Arrived in Natal, Brazil.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Strengthen Exchange Controls</h3>
<p>Remittances Exceeding 1,000 Yuan Require Permits; Japanese Industrial and Commercial Capitalists Extremely Uneasy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In December of last year, the Japanese government implemented a revised exchange control law, the purpose of which was to prevent excessive adverse trends in international trade balances and to facilitate the import of raw materials for military industries. This law is now scheduled to expire on the 31st of this month. The Exchange Control Committee of the Ministry of Finance held a meeting of its executive committee yesterday, and in view of the continued increase in import surpluses this year and the serious status of the Japanese yen exchange rate, it was decided that, in addition to extending the validity period of the law for a considerable period of time, the provisions of the law would be strengthened. According to the law, any remittance exceeding 30,000 yuan in a one-month period must obtain permission from the Ministry of Finance. Subsequently, any remittance exceeding 1,000 yuan in a one-month period will require a permit. The official order from the Ministry of Finance regarding this provision will be announced next week. It is reported that Japanese industrial and commercial capitalists have expressed extreme unease about the government's policy of strengthening exchange controls. Japanese industrialists and merchants operating in China have sent representatives to petition the Ministries of Finance, Army, Commerce and Industry, and Foreign Affairs, requesting that businesses related to Japanese industrial and commercial capitalists in China be exempted from the application of the control law. At the same time, the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday to exempt export industries from the same restrictions when purchasing foreign exchange for importing necessary raw materials. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has rejected this request. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Develops Military Industry</h3>
<p>Total Investment Soars; However, Profitability Declines</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to statistics released by the Bank of Japan today, the total amount of increased investment decided by banks and companies in the first half of this year has reached an astonishing figure, namely 1,839,563,000 yuan, which is 97.2 million yuan more than the capital increased during the same period last year, or 116 percent. Among industries, the largest increase in capital was in machinery manufacturing and the metal industry, amounting to 445.8 million yuan; the second was the mining industry, with 185.7 million yuan; and the third was the chemical industry, with 170 million yuan. The aforementioned three items alone account for more than 44 percent of the total increase in capital in the first half of the year, which is enough to indicate the remarkable expansion of the military industry. Regarding the profitability of Japanese industry, the Hypothec Bank of Japan announced today the results of its investigation in the second half of last year. During this period, the average profit rate of various industries was 14.5 percent, a decrease of 0.2 percent compared with the first half of last year. However, the average profit rate of 14.5 percent undoubtedly proves that Japanese industry is still in the prosperous stage that began with the September 18th Incident. As for the reason for the slight decrease in interest rates, on the one hand, it is due to the soaring prices of raw materials, and on the other hand, it is due to the sudden and huge increase in investment, resulting in a corresponding reduction in interest rates.

<h3>Soviet Purge of the Party</h3>
<p>Large Number of Officials Dismissed</p>
<p>[London] According to the latest news from Moscow, the Soviet authorities are continuing to purge suspected elements in the country's political, journalistic, scientific, and artistic circles. Iakov Agranov, Deputy People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and concurrently head of the National Criminal Investigation Department, Pro-nofeev, Deputy People's Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs, and Rozenholtz, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, have all been dismissed. In addition, officials in the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs who were former subordinates of the former Deputy Commissar Krestinsky, such as Mironov, an assistant in the Information Department, and Stein, Director of the Western European Department, have all been dismissed. Furthermore, Ostrovsky, Deputy Director of the State Farm Administration, and Bersin, Deputy Director of the National Bank, have also been dismissed. As for writers, Kirshon, the former editor of the Compilation Bureau, Lidov, Director of the Soviet Arts Committee, and Ialgatin, manager of the Moscow Art Theatre, have been arrested. Academicians Talerval and Obnorsky were condemned for allowing Trotskyists to use the new dictionary currently being compiled as a propaganda tool and are being investigated by the authorities. Dr. Pleiner, the medical advisor to Stalin's wife, has been dismissed for improper conduct and damaging morality. However, there is absolutely no basis for the rumor that the Soviet authorities' actions have an anti-Semitic nature, as the majority of Jews still hold important positions. In addition, the rumor that Radek, the former editor of Pravda, who was condemned for his involvement in the anti-revolutionary parallel center case, was released for reporting on the Tukhachevsky case is also inaccurate. Observers believe that another shocking case will soon occur in the Soviet Union, and Yezhov, the former head of the political police, may be implicated at that time.

<h3>Belgian King Encourages Veterans</h3>
<p>Adhere to Order, Respect the Rule of Law; Minister of Justice Assaulted by the Public</p>
<p>⊙Brussels: Regarding the amnesty laws passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives on two issues, the regulations stipulate that all criminals, except those sentenced to death who have already had their sentences commuted, can be pardoned. Flemish nationalist separatists who committed treason during the European War are therefore mostly included in the amnesty and can have their civil rights restored. This aspect is strongly opposed by Belgian veterans, who petitioned King Leopold III on the 23rd of last month, requesting the resignation of the Zeeland cabinet and the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The King agreed to consider it. Until yesterday, he again received a delegation of veterans, informing them that the amnesty law has been formally established and cannot be discussed, and that the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the resignation of the cabinet cannot be carried out. However, the public opinion is boiling, which is also a real situation. All our veterans should express their opinions in adhering to order and respecting the rule of law. The rights enjoyed by veterans are the same as those of other citizens. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels: Regarding the amnesty issue, Justice Minister Travailer (leader of the youth group of the Liberal Party and a strong opponent of Degrelle, leader of the Rex Party) has been dissatisfied with the public because he acted in unison with the cabinet. Yesterday, when he came out of the Mons City Court, he was suddenly ambushed by about ten demonstrators, who surrounded the car he was riding in, yelled abuse, ordered him to get out of the car, and even attacked him with canes. Travailer was consequently knocked off his hat. Although the police provided many protections, he was finally punched by the crowd before breaking through the encirclement.

<h3>International Chamber of Commerce Passes Financial Policy Proposal</h3>
<p>Promote International Cooperation, Achieve Economic Recovery</p>
<p>[Berlin] The International Chamber of Commerce held its last meeting today and passed a number of motions, the most important of which are: ㊀ the recovery of the world economy, ㊁ monetary issues, and ㊂ international trade. The resolution on the recovery of the world economy stated that the International Chamber of Commerce believes that international trade cannot prosper without peace, and that living standards cannot be improved if normal commodity transactions cannot be restored. In order to maintain peace, each country will make considerable sacrifices based on the strength of its national power, but there is no doubt that the competition to reorganize armaments is enough to endanger peace and reduce living standards. Therefore, it is imperative to achieve a peaceful resolution of various political disputes. At the same time, it should be recognized that there are considerable differences in the natural resources, climate, and population of various countries. Therefore, to the extent possible, countries should enjoy the supply of agricultural and industrial raw materials without any discrimination. The economic expansion of the past few days is the best opportunity to eliminate international trade barriers. The resolution also stated that the undertaking of various armaments plans should be replaced by new production undertakings. Governments of all countries should take the necessary steps to implement this recommendation. The International Chamber of Commerce's resolution on monetary issues believes that the restoration of the gold standard, the stability of currencies, the restoration of international credit, international cooperation on monetary matters, and the resolution of political loans are the foundation for restoring a rational financial situation, and that a sound currency is enough to promote international trade and the flow of funds, and can reduce international political tensions.

<h3>United States Has a Fiscal Deficit in the Last Fiscal Year</h3>
<p>Reaching 280 Million Yuan</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced today that the Treasury Department has closed the fiscal year ending at the end of June, with a gross deficit of $2,811,000,000. Total revenue for the year was $5,294,000,000, an increase of $70,000,000 compared to the budget. Expenditures were $8,105,000,000, an increase of $23,000,000 compared to the budget. The failure to quickly recover the loans released by the government is a major reason for the revenue shortfall. The total national debt now reaches $36,424,000,000, an increase of $2,646,000,000 in the last fiscal year. Total gold reserves reached $12,318,000,000, an increase of $2,300,000,000 in the last fiscal year, accounting for 53 percent of the world's currency amount. According to recent figures, the US government has spent approximately $13,500,000,000 more than its revenue in the past four years. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Advice from Germany and Italy is Difficult for Britain and France to Accept</h3>
<p>Especially opposed to recognizing warring parties. The Non-Intervention Committee meeting falls into stagnation.</p>
<p>[London] At the meeting of the Subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee this afternoon, Lord Plymouth declared that if a complete monitoring plan could not be drafted and established, the British government would not approve, even though the non-intervention policy had not been rendered impossible, it had already caused great hardship. Today's subcommittee meeting was intended to draft a notice on the stagnation of negotiations, stating that the reasons for the stagnation were: (1) Germany and Italy withdrew from the monitoring plan, and the naval gap was to be filled by the British and French navies, which was not approved by Italy and Germany; (2) Britain and France were unwilling to grant the Spanish National Army the rights of a belligerent, as suggested by Italy and Germany, because Britain and France feared that this would give the National Army leader Franco an excessive advantage. The Portuguese representative declared that if the British and French plan could be approved by the entire Non-Intervention Committee, the Portuguese government would also be willing to accept it. Other countries, including Belgium, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Soviet Russia, have all agreed to the British and French plan. The Portuguese representative also requested that the suggestions of Italy and Germany be given serious consideration. However, the British government believes that the suggestions of Italy and Germany are unacceptable. The French representative, Ribbentrop, did not acknowledge that the Spanish National Army would gain a superior position after obtaining the rights of a belligerent, and stated that Germany had no intention of favoring the National Army and disadvantaging the government army. However, Germany is willing to give favorable consideration to the participation of German inspectors in the land monitoring plan. After more than two hours of discussion, the subcommittee adjourned, and the new situation will be left to the plenary meeting to be held next week for discussion. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] In an effort to break the deadlock in the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee, British and French authorities have decided to take strong action against Germany and Italy, requesting that the full committee meet next week to discuss a final solution. British Foreign Secretary Eden declared to the House of Commons today that if the Non-Intervention Committee collapses, it will create a new situation, the nature of which cannot be predicted at present. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky declared at the subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee today that the Spanish Civil War has in fact become an international war. Diplomatic circles believe that the Baltic Sea countries, the Scandinavian countries, the Little Entente countries, and Belgium and the Netherlands will all support the British and French proposals, and the Portuguese representative has been ordered not to oppose the British and French proposals. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War, Germany and Italy have expressed their rejection of the new monitoring plan for the Spanish sea proposed by Britain and France, and have put forward a counter-proposal, advocating that both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War be recognized as belligerent groups. Responsible parties recently expressed their opinions on this matter, saying that France will firmly oppose the recognition of belligerent groups as required by Germany and Italy, because this measure is only beneficial to the Spanish National Army. The responsible parties further pointed out that the counter-proposal of Germany and Italy is tantamount to advocating the abolition of the international monitoring system and replacing it with a blockade implemented by both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War. However, according to international law, a naval blockade must be effectively implemented before it can be recognized by third countries. Neither party involved in the Spanish Civil War has the ability to implement a blockade, and this blockade method is sufficient to cause extremely dangerous incidents, and has a huge impact on the traffic between France and North Africa, which is definitely unacceptable to France. Furthermore, it is generally believed that the Portuguese government has now refused to allow British inspectors to continue to implement monitoring on the border between Spain and Portugal, so France cannot allow continued monitoring on the border between France and Spain in the Pyrenees Mountains.</p>
<p>As for Britain and France, they have already decided to make the greatest efforts to maintain the principle of non-intervention and the monitoring measures, but they should still reserve the freedom to reconsider their position on the Spanish incident. If the above efforts fail, Britain and France will naturally resume their freedom of action. Based on the above attitude, France has expressed its determination to maintain its national dignity and interests related to survival, and not allow them to be violated. At the same time, it will also strive to avoid any actions that may increase the international severe situation. In short, France is unwilling to interfere in the internal division of Spain due to different theories, but if Germany and Italy plant their power in Spain and the Mediterranean, and attempt to cut off the sea traffic routes between Britain and France, then it is definitely unacceptable to France.

<h3>The Door to Negotiations on the Spanish Issue is Not Closed</h3>
<p>The Four Countries are Conducting Diplomatic Contacts, and the British Prime Minister Advocates a Firm Attitude</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy are now actively conducting diplomatic negotiations, and will use all possible methods to reach an agreement. They will not give up negotiations until all avenues have been exhausted. French Ambassador to Britain Corbin has already set off to return to his country to consult with Foreign Minister Delbos. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will also be in constant contact with Foreign Secretary Eden. According to general knowledge, most members of the British cabinet, after hearing the latest report submitted by Foreign Secretary Eden, advocate compromise on the Spanish issue. Only Prime Minister Chamberlain still adopts a firm attitude. (Havas from Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The political circles here are quite disappointed and surprised by the development of the non-intervention situation in London. A spokesperson said that Germany's proposal was carefully drafted in accordance with the request in the British note. The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee did not conduct a close review and rejected it rashly, and it is not known what the reason is. Those who reject our proposal must bear the responsibility for the overall situation. However, adjourning the meeting for a few days to allow for leisurely discussion is also wise. Now, we can only wait for other countries to discuss this matter further. As for our urgent goal, it is to maintain and consolidate the non-intervention policy. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] German newspapers expressed their gratification that yesterday's meeting of the subcommittee of the London Adjustment Committee did not declare a breakdown. However, they said that if future negotiations fail, the responsibility should be borne by Britain and France. The German General Bulletin stated: "The situation is serious, but not hopeless. All relevant countries should discuss the new situation in a calm manner and put aside the issue of prestige." The magazine "National Defense Frontline," which is hosted by the army, stated that the tolerance of Germany and Italy has reached its limit. (Havas from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the Spanish issue, the public here was relieved to hear that the communiqué issued yesterday by the subcommittee of the London Adjustment Committee did not declare that negotiations had broken down. Although the Italian government seemed to contrast the so-called goodwill of Germany and Italy with the attitude of Britain and France, it was also unwilling to break down, and therefore expressed satisfaction with the continuation of the negotiations. In short, the Italian diplomatic authorities intend to delay the Spanish issue, which is exactly the same as last year's issue with Abyssinia. (Havas from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation of the Non-Intervention Committee</h3>
<p>After Receiving Instructions from Their Respective Countries, a Plenary Meeting Will Be Convened</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Spanish Civil War Adjustment Committee held its second meeting this afternoon, and it was decided that the representatives of the participating countries would send the monitoring plan proposed by Britain and France (that is, Britain and France would be responsible for the entire monitoring work on the Spanish sea, and neutral country inspectors would be sent to board the warships participating in the monitoring for inspection) and the counter-proposal put forward by Germany and Italy (that is, advocating the cessation of naval monitoring, the continuation of land monitoring, and the recognition of both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups) to their respective governments for instructions. The Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting in the middle of next week. By then, the replies from the governments of various countries should be sent. In addition, what was discussed by the subcommittee this afternoon was the drafting of a long communiqué to report the details of the subcommittee's meeting this morning. In short, from now until the Adjustment Committee holds a plenary meeting, there are only a few days. The diplomatic authorities of various countries should seek all possible ways to avoid a final breakdown during these few days. Among the remarks made by the representatives of various countries at today's meeting, the most noteworthy is that the representatives of various countries unanimously advocated maintaining the principle of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. However, the opinions of the representatives of various countries differed greatly on the implementation methods of this principle. Therefore, before the Adjustment Committee holds a plenary meeting, the diplomatic negotiations between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy should take this implementation method as their starting point. At today's meeting, Britain alone announced its firm opposition to the counter-proposal put forward by Germany and Italy. In addition to Germany and Italy, the representatives of various countries believe that the act of recognizing the rights of belligerent groups poses a great danger to international maritime trade, because once the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War have been recognized as belligerent groups, they can unscrupulously use the latest types of military equipment to engage in naval warfare. As a result, the Strait of Gibraltar will in fact be blockaded. If so, it will be tantamount to cutting off the traffic routes between the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Suez Canal. Also, the Portuguese representative, Minister to Britain Monteiro, attempted to reconcile the British-French and German-Italian plans at today's meeting, but was unsuccessful. He finally stated that if the new monitoring plan of Britain and France is unanimously approved, the Portuguese government can accept it in principle. At the same time, some people in diplomatic circles have put forward several suggestions, such as (1) recognizing the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups, but the exercise of the rights of belligerent groups is limited to within Spanish territorial waters; (2) in the monitoring method, the patrol of naval warships can be cancelled and replaced by the monitoring of various Spanish ports, and the Adjustment Committee should send personnel to reside in the ports to take on the monitoring work.

<h3>Yin Traitor Colludes with a Certain Party to Mine Tungsten Mines in Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>Organizes Dacheng Company to Preside Over Operations The Mining Area is Located in Huanghuashan, Jixian The Products are Only Allowed to be Purchased by Japanese and Puppet Authorities</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication It was recently discovered that the Huanghuashan area of Jixian County, which is under the jurisdiction of the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization, has a rich reserve of large-scale tungsten mines. The ore outcrops on the ground have reached 20 square kilometers, and the ore veins follow the Huanghuashan Mountains to the Great Wall. In order to win the favor of a certain party, the Yin traitor urgently dispatched technical personnel from the "Eastern Hebei" puppet gold mining bureau and engineers from the Xinglong County gold mine to measure and prepare a preliminary report, which was sent to a certain party in March of this year. Subsequently, a certain party's special agency in Tongxian came forward to negotiate and agreed that both certain and puppet parties would each invest 500,000 yuan to carry out mining. However, in order to avoid attracting attention, neither certain nor puppet parties were named. Instead, they established the Dacheng Tungsten Mining Company in the name of private individuals. A certain party sent Amino Ichibu, Kuroshio Toshiharu, Tsuneta Kenji, etc. as initiators, while the Yin traitor sent Huang Houqing, Zhang Huaxuan, Lin Shiyan, etc. as initiators. A certain party also put forward three requirements to the Yin traitor: (1) Dacheng Tungsten Mining Company must be under the absolute supervision of the Tongxian Special Agency; (2) The tungsten ore produced must be purchased by Japan and "Manchukuo" as the legal purchaser, and may not be sold to third parties without the permission of the Tongxian Special Agency; (3) A certain party has the power to independently expand capital and administer personnel. The Yin traitor originally wanted to curry favor and immediately agreed. The Dacheng Tungsten Mining Co., Ltd. was declared established on June 19 at No. 2 Qianjie Street, Tongxian. On that day, the Yin traitor and Hosoki, the director of the Japanese special agency stationed in Tongxian, attended the meeting and elected Amino Ichibu, Huang Houqing, Zhang Huaxuan, Lin Shiyan, and Kuroshio Toshiharu as directors, and Tsuneta Kenji and Lu Decheng as supervisors. At the moment, the tungsten mining company, according to the preliminary report prepared by the "Eastern Hebei Puppet Gold Mining Bureau Technical Personnel and Xinglong County Mining Engineer," has specially invited specialized engineers from Japan's Yu Zhong Company to conduct detailed surveys of the Huanghuashan mining area, while purchasing mining machinery and all auxiliary equipment, and building office buildings in the mining area and Jixian County. It is expected that tungsten can be officially mined in August of this year. Tungsten is even more important than aluminum in military needs. Japan's five-year national defense plan is underway, and the Japanese side believes that this large amount of tungsten production is a gift from heaven. It is also learned that Dacheng Tungsten Mining Company does not have smelting equipment, and in order to reduce costs, it will transport raw tungsten to Japan and "Manchukuo". The Yin traitor is willing to sacrifice national defense raw materials in order to curry favor with a certain party, which is truly hateful. (1st)</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of Disaster-Stricken Counties in Gansu</h3>
<p>And the Miserable Situation of Those Urgently Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Lanzhou Communication According to a report from the Provincial Civil Affairs Department, Gansu Province has suffered repeated disasters for more than ten years, especially the disaster situation in the 25th year, which was the most serious. First, natural disasters, followed by banditry, the disaster victims were displaced, houses were turned into ruins, and cries of misery were heard everywhere. The central government sympathized with the disaster victims and allocated funds for relief, but the disaster area was vast and the number of disaster victims was large, so it was like a drop in the bucket and did not help. The actual situation of all disasters from the 25th year to June of this year, and the miserable situation of those urgently awaiting relief, are summarized and described below.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the Actual Situation of the Natural Disasters in the 25th Year</p>
<p>(1) Drought and Famine in Various Counties in Hexi Due to past military disasters and the hardships of requisitioning and transporting, the people of the seventeen counties in Hexi could not bear their lives. In the spring and summer of the 25th year, the drought was particularly severe. In counties such as Jiuquan, Wuwei, Zhangye, Gaotai, Linze, Jinta, Dingxin, Minle, Yongchang, Shandan, Yumen, Anxi, and Dunhuang, countless people suffered from drought and fled from famine. Among them, Wuwei and Zhangye counties also suffered from torrential rain and flood disasters. Dunhuang, Gaotai, Jinta, Dingxin, and Yongchang counties also suffered from gale disasters. Shandan and Jinta counties also suffered from black frost disasters.</p>
<p>(2) Hail Disasters in Various Counties in Longnan, West, and East Various counties in Longnan, Longxi, and Longdong suffered repeated hail disasters. Many summer and autumn crops were destroyed. Houses and farmland were also collapsed. The affected areas included Fulan, Lintao, Dingxi, Longxi, Minxian, Yongdeng, Weiyuan, Kangle, Huating, Longde, Lixian, Xihe, Tongwei, Wushan, Qingyang, Zhenyuan, Zhengning, Zhuanglang, Chongxin, Huaping, Taosha, Pingliang, Jingning, Guyuan, Yuzhong, Qingshui, Jingchuan, Jingtai, and Xiahe, a total of twenty-nine counties. Among them, Kangle and Xihe counties also suffered from earthquake disasters. Lintao, Huating, and Zhuanglang counties also suffered from torrential rain and flood disasters. Zhenyuan and Qingshui counties also suffered from severe cold, frost, and snow that froze and killed spring seedlings.</p>
<p>(3) Miscellaneous Disasters in Various Counties, Gan Gu and Qin An counties suffered from continuous rain disasters. Huixian, Liangdang, and Tianshui counties suffered from drought demons. Wudu and Kangxian counties suffered from wild boars and torrential rain. Tianshui, Xihe, and Hezheng counties suffered from earthquake disasters.</p>
<p>According to statistics, there are a total of sixty-six counties and one administrative bureau in this province. Now, sixteen counties have suffered from drought disasters, twenty-nine counties have suffered from hail disasters, and five counties have suffered from other disasters, totaling fifty counties, accounting for 75% of all counties in the province. According to investigations and reports, the drought-stricken counties lacked winter snow and spring rain, and were unable to sow seeds on time, resulting in thousands of miles of red land and withered grass roots. The disaster victims ate up the tree bark, and there were deaths everywhere on the road. The remaining disaster victims fled and were displaced. The situation was miserable. As for the hail disaster, after the violent thunder and gale, hailstones followed, small as soybeans, large as chicken eggs and human fists, and several inches thick. Some were as large as bowls or even weighed hundreds of pounds, and did not completely melt in one or two days. Houses, people, and animals were struck, and many collapsed and died. The crops were completely destroyed, or even not a blade of grass remained. At the same time, after melting, floods raged, and farmland was washed away into rivers, or silted up with sand and gravel, making it impossible to replant. This natural disaster has an unprecedentedly wide disaster area and severe disaster situation. The suffering of the disaster victims has reached its extreme. Unexpectedly, the bandit troops from Sichuan and Shaanxi invaded again and ravaged everywhere.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the Actual Situation of the Bandit Disasters in the 25th Year</p>
<p>(1) The Course of Being Bandited Since the summer of the 24th year, bandit troops leaving the border, leading tens of thousands of people, disturbed Minxian, Zhangxian, Weiyuan, Longxi, Wushan, Gangu, and Tongwei counties from northern Sichuan. Tongwei County was lost. Another tens of thousands of people disturbed Huixian, Chengxian, Liangdang, Kangxian, Xihe, Lixian, Tianshui, Qin'an, Qingshui, and Tongwei counties in southern Shaanxi, joining forces with the bandit troops from northern Sichuan, and passing through Zhuanglang, Longde, Jingning, Huating, Pingliang, Zhenyuan, and Jingchuan counties in eastern Longdong, capturing the county towns of Liangdang, Qin'an, and Longde, and joining forces with the bandit troops entrenched in Qingyang and Dongxian, with great momentum. By June and July of the 25th year, the bandit troops from northern Sichuan entrenched in northern Shaanxi and eastern Longdong, and the bandit troops previously entrenched in various counties in Qingyang, advanced to capture Huanxian, disturbed Guyuan, Zhenyuan, and Haiyuan, and in August, the bandit leader led 100,000 bandit troops from northern Sichuan in separate routes into Gansu. One route entered Minxian from Sichuan and disturbed Lintan, Xiahe, Weiyuan, Zhangxian, Longxi, Lintao, Kangle, and Tongwei counties, causing Lintan, Zhangxian, Weiyuan, and Tongwei counties to fall one after another. Another route invaded Xigu County from northern Sichuan and disturbed Wudu, Tianshui, Xihe, and Lixian counties to the northeast, capturing the county towns of Huixian, Chengxian, Kangxian, and Liangdang, and then transferred from Huicheng and other counties, passing through Tianshui, Gangu, Wushan, and joined Longxi, Tongwei, and Weiyuan counties. Tongwei and Weiyuan counties were lost again. Then, the two routes joined forces, cut off the Xilan Highway, captured Huining, surrounded Dingxi, and attacked Jingyuan and Haiyuan counties. They coordinated with the bandit troops from northern Sichuan in eastern Longdong and the bandit troops from southern Shaanxi who disturbed Longnan. The bandit troops who had previously entered Minxian and Lianggu counties from northern Sichuan crossed the river from Jingyuan and disturbed the seventeen counties in Hexi, causing the county towns of Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, and Gaotai to fall one after another.

<h3>Floods in Jiangxi Province Cause Disaster</h3>
<p>Jiyi Grand Dyke Suddenly Collapses All Rivers in Gan Rao Xin Report Disasters</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication Since the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar, the temperature in Jiangxi Province has suddenly dropped, and continuous rain has not stopped. The early rice has been affected by the cold rain, and its development has been greatly affected. Some have even bloomed without flowering and bearing fruit. This has a great impact on common crops. On the other hand, flash floods broke out everywhere, and both small ports and large rivers rose sharply, especially the Gan and Fu rivers. After June 20, the water level of the Gan River reached more than eight meters, only a few inches away from the largest flood level in the 20th year of the Republic. The Fu River suddenly rose four meters on the 25th and 26th, and the overflows of various tributaries such as the Xiu, Rao, and Xin rivers were intertwined to form a serious flood. All low-lying areas were a vast expanse of water. Jishui, Xiajiang, Xingguo, Shangrao, Yiyang, Yongxiu, and other places reported disasters and sent emergency calls to the province. The Water Conservancy Bureau immediately mobilized all members and went to the original eight flood control areas to supervise local people to form flood control teams and rescue major dikes. Among them, the Diyi Grand Dyke was the barrier of Nanchang and Xinjian counties, with a dike length of more than 60 miles and more than tens of thousands of mu of rice fields inside the dike. Since the beginning of the flood in early June, thousands of farmers and workers have been guarding it in shifts. However, because the dike body was immersed in water for too long, a section of Jiangjiabu and Xucun suddenly collapsed by seven or eight feet on the 27th, shaking the rivers and mountains. All the villages of Qing She were washed away, cattle, sheep, and utensils were swept away by the waves, and some were unable to escape and were buried in the belly of the fish. The rice fields are even more out of the question.</p>
<p>At present, the water level of the Gan Fu Xiu Rao rivers is rising and falling uncertainly. According to news from the Water Conservancy Bureau, in the nearly one month of continuous rain in this province, at first, because the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake were still discharging smoothly, the rise was fast, and the retreat was also rapid. At this moment, because the water level of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River has surged sharply, even though the weather has cleared up, the retreat is extremely slow. And because the various dikes have been immersed in water for too long and the farmers are too tired to defend, the yin elephant is still surrounding them. This flood has affected the traffic. In addition to the Gan Yue and Gan Wan highways being destroyed in many places due to the washed away roadbeds and bridges, the Hangzhou-Yushan section of the Gan Zhe Road was also stopped on the 26th due to the large floods in Jianshan. The Nanping section was delayed due to the destruction of earthwork. At present, in addition to ordering the county magistrates to strictly protect the dikes, the provincial government is also responsible for the Provincial Relief Association to rush to handle emergency relief for the disaster situation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Expansion of the Bear Repulsion Incident</p>
<p>Since the news of the change of head of the local Education Bureau spread, all sectors have been sending telegrams to the provincial government requesting the withdrawal of the decision. Yesterday, the County Education Association, Lawyers Association, County Chamber of Commerce, and various companies jointly sent telegrams, all voicing the same appeal. It is also reported that the County Education Association will convene a provisional conference on the 4th to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish a Textile and Dyeing Factory</p>
<p>Former Civil Affairs Director Miao Bin, recently, in order to develop industry and resist foreign economic aggression, specially initiated the establishment of the Minfu Textile and Dyeing Factory, with a capital of two million yuan. The address is selected outside the South Gate of this town, covering an area of about 200 mu. Currently, it is collecting funds, purchasing land, and actively preparing. It is expected that it can be officially started within this year.</p>
<p>Rice, Wheat, and Flour Continue to Rise</p>
<p>The market condition of wheat in this town is that due to the scarcity of goods arriving, the sales are quite good, resulting in price increases. Each bag has reached nine yuan, eight jiao, and two fen. The market price of flour has also increased accordingly. The Green Deer produced by the Jiuyan Factory in this town and the Green Battleship produced by the Maoxin Factory have risen to four yuan and seven fen per bag. Moreover, the sales are quite smooth, with a trend of demand exceeding supply. Therefore, each factory is working day and night, actively shipping goods. In addition, the market conditions for rice and paddy have also seen increases, with Qingbai Geng rice at eleven yuan to ten yuan and eight jiao, and Geng paddy at five yuan and six jiao to five yuan and five jiao. Ordinary people who rely on grain for food are terrified due to the rising cost of living.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Appeals Against Wheat Detention</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce believes that grain merchants who buy and sell wheat have already paid the annual business tax. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance again entrusted the Shanghai Flour Factory's collection agencies to collect a first overlapping tax from wheat sellers, which is inconsistent with the principle of taxation. It is requesting to exempt one of them. However, the Taijiabao Business Tax Bureau detained two wheat boats in Xuhang Town the day before yesterday, forcing them to pay a second overlapping tax. Merchants and civilians, feeling overwhelmed, have specially telegraphed the Finance Department authorities to designate one of the aforementioned three taxes to be paid to comply with the principles of taxation and to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the Riverbank Protection Committee</p>
<p>The riverbank in the Liuxu area under the jurisdiction of this town is prone to collapse every year when there are strong winds. In the past five or six years, the number of collapses has increased. Town residents Zhu Zhuxuan, Lu Shaoliu, Bao Xiangzhong, and others had previously organized a riverbank protection preparation committee and sent letters to solicit important figures from Yangzhen in Beijing, Shanghai, and related areas to serve as committee members. This was done to facilitate the allocation of funds from the central and provincial party and government water conservancy authorities to build water dikes. However, due to the large amount of funds and difficult construction, it was not possible to realize this in the short term, leading to indefinite delays. Recently, there has been news of the revival of the organization. Various parties plan to recommend Han Zhishi, Wang Boling, Hong Lanyou, Xu Xinwu, Leng Yuqiu, and others as standing committee members of the association. It is also reported that Han Zhishi will come to Yangzhou in the next few days, and it is planned to hold an inaugural meeting after Han's arrival.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Summer Cocoons Appear, Another Poor Harvest</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province had a poor spring cocoon harvest this year, and farmers in various counties mostly supplemented with summer cocoons. The Silk Control Association specially purchased and distributed 70,000 improved breeds from Jiangsu Province for silkworm rearing in various counties. Recently, summer fresh cocoons have already appeared on the market, and cocoon merchants have opened scales for purchase. However, due to unfavorable weather during the mildew season, the harvest is poor. It is now known that the improved breeds yielded only about 50%, while local breeds yielded no more than 20-30%. The quantity of cocoons produced is extremely scarce.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Measures to Urgently Repair the Wenyan Pond</p>
<p>The Wenyan Zhuanwantang embankment is facing danger due to continuous heavy rains and tidal erosion. The villagers in the town have presented a request to the Water Conservancy Bureau to find ways to urgently repair it. After receiving the request, Director He of the bureau immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and dispatched an engineering team to rescue the situation. The grouting project has been completed, and an earth embankment has been added near the pond body to prevent tidal erosion. It is expected that the autumn flood tide can be protected without worry.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Two Cases of Soil Smuggling Cracked</p>
<p>Shen Zhongxian, a soil smuggler from Xia Xijie, Fengjing, together with his concubine Shen Tangshi, Wang Sanguan's wife, a soil smuggler from Huat Bridge, Chenxiang, and opium addicts Gu Zhizhong and Jin Zifa (also known as Shen Sifa) were arrested by Police Captain Wu Wentao, along with Detective Xu Zihuai, at their addresses. In addition, 32 liang of tobacco, several jin of opium, and multiple sets of opium paraphernalia were seized and sent to the county for investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Fishermen Celebrate a Bumper Harvest</p>
<p>Over a hundred pairs of large fishing boats from Dongqian Lake, Yin County, went to sea last year and have now returned home, making profits ranging from two to three thousand yuan to five to six thousand yuan, which is rare in recent years. Fresh seafood merchants also made profits of nearly ten thousand yuan. Squid boats are also returning home one after another, with an unprecedented bumper harvest. Recently, fishermen and seafood boat customers in various places along the lake are all performing operas to celebrate.</p>
<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>Money Shops Refuse to Exchange Mixed Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>Various businesses in Yuyao receive a large number of mixed-color subsidiary coins, but unexpectedly, silver and money shops refuse to accept and exchange them, which has aroused opposition from various industry associations. Because various industries cannot refuse to accept and receive them, and accumulating them for a long time without an exchange mechanism will inevitably affect business turnover, they have jointly presented a request to the County Chamber of Commerce to send letters to the silver and money industries, asking them to temporarily accept and exchange them at the current price to maintain currency policy and benefit commerce.</p>
<h3>Dinghai</h3>
<p>Actively Preventing and Controlling Insect Pests</p>
<p>Song caterpillars occurred in various townships under the jurisdiction of the Second District last month, causing severe damage to an area of about 3,000 mu. The county government originally planned to use strong laborers for prevention and control. However, because the farmers in the township are mostly fishermen, the busy season is different. If mandatory capture and removal are implemented, it will be difficult. Therefore, the reward collection method was changed. Since the implementation, significant results have been achieved. A total of more than 13,000 jin have been captured and killed, costing more than 700 yuan. Prevention and control are still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Water Conservancy Engineering Office</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the Huai, Yi, and Shu rivers in northern Jiangsu flood annually. Since the Huai River Engineering Office is limited to the end of June, it seems that there must be a responsible agency for the prevention and control of the Huai, Yi, and Shu rivers. Therefore, the Huai, Yi, and Shu Water Conservancy Engineering Office was established in Qingjiang, and Xu Xinwu of the Huai River Engineering Office was still appointed as the director, ordering him to start work on July 1.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Food Prices Soar Unceasingly</p>
<p>Food in this county is scarce because few goods arrive from Shanghai, and guest merchants send people to buy in Gaoyou, which has the potential for demand to exceed supply. When wheat was first on the market, it was sold for only more than six yuan per dan. Prices have been increasing. Now the top wheat has risen to ten yuan and four jiao per dan. Not much has arrived from the countryside, and the wheat merchants are vying to collect it, so there is still a tendency to increase. Rice and beans have also increased due to purchases by guest merchants. Rice has increased by more than one yuan per dan compared to before, soybeans have risen to ten yuan, seven or eight jiao, and green beans have also risen to more than eleven yuan. Flour is in short supply, and each bag has also increased by one jiao and five fen.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Prosecutor Song of the First Special District Court Summoned Witnesses to Investigate Wu Sheng's Crimes</h3>
<p>Mu Xiangyue testified that Sheng Laoqi was a large multi-headed speculator. Kuang Yunwen said that Wu Qiding was indeed engaged in speculative trading. Before the court session, someone distributed leaflets in the court.</p>
<p>Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry and Deputy Minister Cheng, together with members of the Control Yuan, came to Shanghai twice to investigate the recent turmoil in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange. As a result, in addition to punishing more than 40 brokers in the exchange according to law, they also suspected that Wu Qiding, the current Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sheng Shengyi (i.e., Sheng Laoqi), the Chief of the Consolidated Tax of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, were involved. The authorities in Beijing have detained the two officials on one side, and ordered the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court to inspect. Yesterday, Prosecutor Song Genshan specially opened an investigation court and summoned Mu Xiangyue, Chairman of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, as well as Yang Shuding, shareholder of Yuanda Company, Yang Yuankai, manager, and Dai Xinghua, client, to court for questioning. Before the court session, those who suffered losses due to this turmoil printed leaflets and distributed them in the court. The leaflet was titled "Customers who suffered from the Yarn Exchange turmoil unanimously rise up to demand compensation from Wen Lanting, the managing director of the exchange." The content was worded with much dissatisfaction with the managing director of the exchange, and cited the remarks made by Zhang Youlun, counselor of the Control Yuan, confirming that Wen Lanting and others cannot shirk their responsibility. It said that they usually live in luxury and are well-fed. What are they supposed to be in charge of? What are these rice buckets for? Comrades who have been harmed, quickly rise up and settle accounts with them, etc. At 9:20, Prosecutor Song took the seat, and there were many spectators. First, Mu Xiangyue was summoned. After asking his name, origin, address, occupation, etc., he was asked about the recent price increase of yarn and cotton. According to Mu, the price increase started about two months ago. It was found that on April 24, the price per bale was 256 yuan, and on May 20, it rose to 270 yuan. On the 25th, it was 280 yuan, and on June 8, it was 295 yuan. It lasted about six weeks and increased by a total of 40 yuan. The reasons for the price increase were: ㊀ rumors of inflation, ㊁ a decrease in spot goods in the market. Previously, there were more than 100,000 bales of spot goods in the market, but in May, it suddenly decreased to 20,000 bales. The news about inflation was mostly rumors, but the biggest reason for the price increase was the lack of spot goods and extremely smooth sales. When the Central Party Department's Control Yuan sent a commissioner and Wu, the Minister of Industry, to investigate at the exchange a few days ago, he also explained this in detail. He questioned Mu about his relationship with Wu and Sheng and whether he knew the exact details of Wu's and others' speculation. Mu said that he did not know them at first. Recently, he met them because they came to investigate. He was even more unaware of their business transactions in the exchange. The exchange only recognizes brokers, and he does not know whether any brokers are trading for them. He is the chairman of the board and does not consult unless there are important matters. The brokers' daily transaction accounts have been reported to the supervisors. When the central officials came to investigate this time, the accounts had already been copied. At that time, he told Minister Wu that Sheng Laoqi was a large multi-headed speculator, which was originally a rumor, but he did not mention Wu Qiding. Wen Lanting, the managing director, also said that Sheng was a large multi-headed speculator, but he also said that he had heard it from rumors. Now all the brokers' related books and records have been sent to the Ministry of Industry, and more than 40 brokers have been punished, etc. Next, Kuang Yunwen, the first section chief of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, stated the process of his investigation with Minister Wu, saying that as of now, no concrete evidence has been found, and the talks from all parties are all rumors. It is difficult to speculate whether they know and do not speak or are unwilling to express themselves. Then Yang Shuding, the shareholder of Yuanda Company, was summoned and asked about Yuanda's trading process on behalf of Dai Xinghua. Yang replied that he did not know much about it, so Yang Yuankai, the manager of the company, was summoned. According to his statement, Dai's transaction was introduced by a Mr. Shen, who is the business director of Jiangzhe Bank, and Dai is the chief accountant of the bank. According to Shen, Wu Qiding is the chairman of Jiangzhe Bank and trusts Dai very much. For the convenience of checking, our company noted Wu's name under Dai Xinghua's Yuanda account name in the customer's ledger, but it did not recognize Dai as Wu's representative. Furthermore, Dai did not know when the notation was filled in, etc. Finally, Dai Xinghua was summoned. According to his statement, before he opened Sanyi Cotton Company on Henan Road, he was in charge of shares in Jiangzhe Bank and only had a working relationship with Wu. I entrusted Yuanda to do public price trading and was introduced by Shen. The company filled in Wu's name under my account name, which was done by the company, and I did not know its intention, etc. Prosecutor Song, after questioning this, ordered an adjournment and ordered all witnesses to send any further evidence to the prosecutor's office at any time for verification. Then he left the court. Written statement According to the Central News Agency, the procuratorate of the First Special District Court opened a court session this morning to investigate. Kuang Yunwen, the first section chief of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, was specially sent to the court to make a statement. The written statement issued by Kuang is as follows: Wu Qiding conducted speculative trading in Yuanda under the name of Yuanda Jia, represented by Dai Xinghua, based on the customer's draft book of Yuanda, which is obviously a violation of the law. This alone proves that the official is indeed engaged in speculative trading with various exchanges. As for Sheng Shengyi, he is the most important person in manipulating the market this time. When Minister Wu inquired about the directors and brokers, the chairman of the board, Mu Xiangyue, clearly pointed out that Sheng Laoqi was involved in front of the Central Party Department investigators, supervisors, exchange supervisors, and Ministry investigators. Although he did not explicitly provide conclusive evidence, the chairman of the board has the responsibility of presiding over the entire exchange. If he had not witnessed and heard it with his own eyes and was familiar with the matter, how could he dismiss it as a rumor and speak lightly? Later, the investigators sent by the Ministry of Industry conducted investigations separately, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing's statement regarding Sheng Shengyi being an important person in this turmoil was almost unanimous. There are many witnesses and heavy suspicion. Wu and Sheng are both important officials in government agencies managing various taxes (including the consolidated tax on yarn and cloth). Wu already has a customer's draft book in Yuanda, whether it is for operating yarn and cotton or government bonds, they are all speculative transactions, which violate the law. And Sheng manipulated the bidding of yarn with huge sums of money this time, raising market prices, causing small-capital businessmen to suffer losses and unable to struggle. Foreign yarn took the opportunity to invade, and the country's economic losses are incalculable. The fact that he took advantage of his official position to directly or indirectly seek profits is obvious, and the circumstances are serious. The Ministry is responsible for thoroughly investigating the matter by order and must truthfully state the facts for reference.</p>

<h3>Zou Lin Arrives at the Yarn Exchange to Investigate the Turmoil</h3>
<p>Regarding the turmoil in the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry previously thoroughly investigated it in consultation with relevant central agencies. All administrative punishments have also been implemented separately. On the judicial side, the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court in this city opened a court session for investigation yesterday. The Ministry of Finance also sent Deputy Minister Zou in person at 2:30 PM yesterday, accompanied by dozens of officials, to thoroughly investigate the exchange. The situation was extremely tense. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin Arrives at the Exchange to Investigate</p>
<p>Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin, because the case involves Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Department, and Sheng Shengyi, Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, specially arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 7:00 PM last night, and personally went to the exchange yesterday afternoon to thoroughly investigate the truth of the case.</p>

<p>After arriving at the exchange at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Vice Minister Zou, accompanied by Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, Secretary Tan Guang, Section Chief Zong Boxuan, and several auditors, first summoned Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Wen Lanting, Managing Director, and four others, as well as Shao Wenmei, President of the Brokers Association, and Zhou Shaokang, Vice President, to ask individual questions about the progress of the turmoil and whether there were any government officials manipulating the situation. Then, he summoned each broker for questioning one by one. The questions asked were whether Wu Qiding, Sheng Shengyi, and other government officials had entrusted them to buy and sell. If not, they were asked to make an on-site pledge and the brokers' client ledgers were checked on the spot. They were returned immediately after checking.</p>
<p>Directors Convene a Board Meeting</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the directors of the exchange convened a board meeting. More than ten people, including Mu Ouchu, Wen Lanting, Ye Zhuotang, Zhang Xiaolin, and Du Yuesheng, attended. Mu Ouchu, as chairman, reported on the recent developments of the turmoil and the Ministry of Finance's dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate the case. He also temporarily summoned Shao Wenmei, President of the Brokers Association, and Zhou Shaokang, Vice President, to inquire about the situation in the brokers' aspects of the case.</p>
<p>Board of Directors Reports to the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Regarding the instruction previously issued by the Ministry of Industry to the board of directors of the exchange, limiting them to one week to truthfully report who was manipulating the recent turmoil, the association, in addition to conducting its own investigation, also informed the Brokers Association to cooperate in the investigation. However, both the Brokers Association and the Board of Directors felt that they could not investigate it. Therefore, they truthfully reported the progress to the Ministry of Industry yesterday.</p>
<p>Discuss Methods of Curbing It in the Coming Days</p>
<p>Regarding the twelve articles of the administrative Yuan passed to crackdown on speculation at the yarn exchange, the exchange believes that if these measures are implemented, the exchange will be in danger of shutting down. The Board of Directors of the exchange and the Brokers Association plan to discuss in the coming days whether they should request the central government to amend or withdraw the order. Once a decision is made, they plan to petition the central government. According to the Central News Agency, the yarn exchange turmoil involves Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi. Wu and Sheng went to Beijing a few days ago to go to the Ministry of Finance to await inquiries. The two vice ministers of the Ministry of Finance, Zou and Xu, reported this to President Jiang by telegram, and received a reply instructing the Ministry to thoroughly investigate the evidence and handle it impartially. Finance Vice Minister Zou took the train to Shanghai on the previous evening and went to the office of the chairman of the board of directors of the yarn and cloth exchange at 2:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Tao Changshan, Tan Guang, Yu Kaizhan, and others, to conduct a thorough investigation. It is heard that after Zou and others arrived at the exchange, they first summoned Mu Xiangyue and Wen Lanting, Zhang Tingzhang, Wu Fengchi, Hu Yunlai, and others for a face-to-face inquiry about the progress of the turmoil and whether Wu Qiding and Sheng Shenggu had manipulated the situation. Mr. Mu immediately explained everything in detail and said that he had not heard of Wu Qiding trading in the exchange. Regarding Sheng Shengyi, he had only heard of such rumors. Vice Minister Zou then asked about the source of the rumors, but he could not point it out. He then summoned Shao Wenmei, President of the Brokers Association, for inquiries. According to the answer, he had not heard of Wu and Sheng ever trading in the exchange. He then summoned the brokers in the exchange and inquired one by one whether Wu and Sheng had entrusted them to buy and sell on their behalf. They answered that they had never had such a situation and each gave a pledge to prove it. It is heard that Vice Minister Zou will report the inquiry results to President Jiang for review in the coming days. It is also heard that the details of the questions and answers of each official during the inquiry yesterday were recorded and signed by the person concerned to show responsibility.</p>

<h3>The End of Chinese Crew Members: American Pacific Company Cancels Sino-American Passenger Liners</h3>
<p>General Pershing and Others to Cease Voyages to the Far East; Layoffs Effective from the 15th of This Month</p>
<p>The U.S. shipping subsidy law, having been passed by Congress, will be implemented from July 1st. All regular mail ships within the Pacific will be eligible for this subsidy. The local Shanghai office of the Great American Shipping Company and the seventeen mail ships of the U.S. Mail Company sailing to Chinese ports will terminate employment of all Chinese crew members, including sailors, cooks, and attendants (each ship employs Chinese accounting for 15% of the total white crew). These positions will be replaced by Americans and African Americans. However, the shipping company authorities had expressed opposition, as Chinese workers are diligent and inexpensive, can cater to the dietary needs of Eastern passengers, and are easy to manage. Replacing them with Americans and African Americans would not only increase expenses but also reduce the number of passengers. To enforce the law, the U.S. government has agreed to subsidize the shipping companies for various losses incurred. Therefore, the Chinese personnel employed by the Great American Shipping Company and the U.S. Mail Company will be laid off starting from the 15th of this month. Furthermore, the American Pacific Steamship Company's three regular passenger liners operating on the Shanghai to San Francisco route—(1) General Lee, (2) General Pershing, and (3) General Sherman—each with 200 first-class cabins and sailing twice monthly to various Far Eastern ports, have traditionally received U.S. government subsidies. However, due to the implementation of the subsidy law and the ineligibility of these three liners, the company has decided to cancel the Sino-American route and discontinue the service of the three passenger ships. Starting with the General Pershing, which departed Shanghai for the U.S. on the 19th of this month, the ship will no longer sail to the Far East after returning to San Francisco. The General Lee and General Sherman will also make their final voyages on this route.</p>

<h3>One of the Six Major Exhibitions: Air Defense Exhibition Hosted Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>News Media Can Preview on the Afternoon of the 6th; Groups of 50 or More Should Notify in Advance by Letter</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office for the Shanghai Municipal Government's 10th Anniversary Commemorative Air Defense Exhibition held a reception for the city's press at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday at 3 PM. The purpose was to report on the significance and value of the air defense exhibition, as well as the progress of the preparation work. Those present included Yu Hongjun, Director of the Preparatory Office; Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Director; Guan Lisheng, Director of the Mobile Air Defense Exhibition of the Military Affairs Commission's Air Defense Department; Instructor Zhang Manyu; Su Gongwang, Director of the General Affairs Group of the Preparatory Office; Chen Kecheng, Director of the Publicity Group; and over thirty reporters from various newspapers. First, Deputy Director Pan reported that the city's air defense exhibition is one of the six major exhibitions commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government's establishment. This air defense exhibition is fortunate to have the support of the Military Affairs Commission's Mobile Air Defense Exhibition, especially Director Guan's assistance, who transported all the materials from the Military Affairs Commission's Mobile Air Defense Exhibition to Shanghai. Therefore, the majority of the materials for this air defense exhibition are provided by the Mobile Air Defense Exhibition, for which we are deeply grateful. The other exhibitions celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government's establishment will last for two weeks. The air defense exhibition was originally scheduled to last for only one week. We sincerely hope that it can extend its duration and close at the same time as the other exhibitions. As for the importance of air defense, everyone knows it. We sincerely hope that the press can publicize it as much as possible so that all citizens can come to visit. For the other exhibitions, those who wish to visit must purchase tickets (the purpose is solely to limit the number of visitors). However, for the air defense exhibition, no ticket purchase is required. Instead, when visitors purchase tickets for any other exhibition, they will be given a free ticket to the air defense exhibition, which will allow them to visit that exhibition. Next, Guan Lisheng, Director of the Mobile Air Defense Exhibition, reported, stating briefly that "air defense" has become a common term. The world says that without air defense, there is no national defense. As for air defense methods, they can be divided into (1) active air defense and (2) passive air defense. The purpose of the air defense exhibition is simply to arouse public attention to air defense and enrich the public's knowledge of air defense. Subsequently, Zhang Manyu, Su Gongwang, Chen Kecheng, and others delivered speeches, stating in essence that if war were to occur again in the future, it would be even more brutal than the "January 28th Incident." Therefore, actively striving for air defense construction and enriching the public's knowledge of air defense are matters of utmost urgency. Among all the exhibitions of the Municipal Government, the most valuable and meaningful is the air defense exhibition. Therefore, it is hoped that the press will publicize it as much as possible so that the people of this city can come to visit. The arrangement of the air defense exhibition will be completed by the morning of the 6th of this month. From the afternoon onwards, if the press wishes to visit or take photographs in advance, they can do so. Tomorrow (the 4th) at 10:00 AM, an air defense film will be screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater. Members of the press are welcome to visit at will. After the opening of the 10th anniversary on July 7th, the film will be distributed to various cinemas for screening, and the public will be allowed to enter the venue free of charge. The arrangements for the exhibitions commemorating the 10th anniversary are generally in order. Yesterday, the members of the preparatory committee went to various venues for inspection and were quite satisfied. Therefore, when the official opening takes place on July 7th, there will be even more satisfactory performances.</p>
<p>▲Exhibition Hours: The exhibition hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily, starting from the opening on the morning of July 7th. It is also heard that the association, in order to facilitate the visit of personnel from various groups to the exhibition, has separately set the time from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM daily as the time for various groups to visit. It is heard that the regulations stipulate that the number of people in a group unit must be 50 or more to be qualified, and the association must be notified by letter one day in advance. It is understood that the association has hired 112 explanation staff for the air defense exhibits to carry out the explanation work. There are staff members stationed in each exhibition room. If visitors have any questions or need to inquire about anything, they can ask the explanation staff for explanations. The explanation staff are divided into morning and afternoon shifts to provide services in rotation.</p>
<p>▲Exhibition Content: The content of the exhibits in each exhibition room is recorded below. The first exhibition room is a model of urban air defense equipment, showing how cities can defend against air raids to ensure safety. There are also insurance umbrellas, camouflage nets, and bombs. The first to fifth exhibition rooms are for active air defense, such as aircraft carriers, airfields, barrage balloons, anti-aircraft artillery positions, various types of aircraft, searchlights, and listening devices. There are detailed models. The various photographs and charts are particularly rich. The sixth to seventh exhibition rooms are for air defense intelligence, such as intelligence display machines and intelligence rooms (with various firefighting equipment). The eighth to eleventh exhibition rooms are for passive air defense, including air-raid shelters and other air defense buildings, as well as the knowledge that citizens should have when encountering air raids, such as first aid and disinfection.

<h3>American Educator Steiner Writes About America's Concern for the Far East Incident</h3>
<p>Taking a Firm Diplomatic Tone Towards the Pacific; Americans Feel the World Has Completely Changed to a New Atmosphere</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Steiner, a famous American educator and professor of political science at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, arrived in Shanghai from the United States this week and has already gone to the capital, planning to travel to Beiping and Manchuria, and then take the Siberian route around the world to collect materials to guide students in researching Far Eastern affairs. Steiner has written a book on Italian politics and is an authority on fascism. According to Steiner, the United States' abandonment of the Philippines and other events has led the public to believe that the United States now wants to withdraw from the East and adopt an isolationist policy to observe the changing world, especially with regard to the Far East. In fact, it is now becoming increasingly clear that the United States will adopt a firm diplomatic tone towards Pacific affairs in the future. Publications of the Pacific Academic Research Association, the Foreign Policy Association, and other international affairs groups are repeatedly clarifying that the isolationist policy cannot be maintained for long. President Roosevelt is now very silent on the so-called Stimson Doctrine, which focuses on negative policies. This is also enough to be a sign. Steiner also said that in assessing the value of diplomatic policy, one should have a broad vision. The close harmony between Britain and the United States is one of the best guarantees of world peace. The recent British-Japanese talks should not affect the interests of the United States. As for the overall situation in Europe, foreign observers generally believe that although France is adjacent to the catastrophes of fascist, communist, and Spanish countries, it is not in danger of revolution. The Blum government's ability to support a whole year is enough for French people's groups to preserve the republic. Steiner concluded that the United States is increasingly concerned about the Far East incident. The focus of attention of people all over the world is now in the Pacific, with the Atlantic still second. The high tide of trade has brought American businesses and society into direct contact with the East. As a result, Americans feel that the world has completely changed to a new atmosphere, and therefore they are paying more attention to Eastern affairs.</p>

<p>The Pacific hurricane season is typically active during the summer and autumn months. The first hurricane of this year occurred last month, but its force was very weak and it soon dissipated. However, a recent new hurricane in the Pacific Ocean was detected by the observatory at 5 PM yesterday. The observatory informed the reporter that the storm had crossed the north side of Luzon Island at 6 AM yesterday and was moving in a northwest or west-northwest direction. The storm's position at 6 AM yesterday was within a 60-nautical-mile radius around 19 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude. The wind force is unknown.</p>
<p>Hot Yesterday</p>
<p>If the direction of the hurricane remains unchanged, the southern coast of our country is at risk of being hit. However, as of 5 PM yesterday, the observatory had not received any further reports, so it is impossible to predict its development. The observatory also released the progress of yesterday's low pressure, which has reached 37 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude, heading east-northeast. As a result, the climate in this city is quite hot. The highest temperature in this city before 3 PM yesterday rose to 91.4 degrees.</p>
<h3>Mad Dogs, Mad Cats, and Mad Rats Rampage in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Five Victims - The Most Tragic is a Four-Year-Old Chinese Child</p>
<p>Mad dogs, mad cats, and mad rats are still rampant in this city, and not a few people have been bitten and lost their lives. A reporter from Datong News Agency has recorded the following:</p>
<p>Mad Dogs, Mad Cats, Mad Rats</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council’s Public Health Department, the number of people who sought treatment and examination for dog rabies transmission reached 105 in May. 73 of them reside in the International Settlement, 3 in the French Concession, 11 in the city, and 18 from other cities. After the department inquired, it learned that the 73 people in the International Settlement who contracted dog rabies had been in contact with 66 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 rats.</p>
<p>Rampage in Shanghai</p>
<p>Worse, two dogs each bit two people in succession, and one cat did the same, resulting in two people being bitten. In addition, two people were bitten by rats. The rampage situation can be imagined. The most tragic case is that of a four-year-old Chinese child who was bitten by a stray dog. Although he was sent to the health department for treatment, he was ultimately not saved. Therefore, it is hoped that parents will take good care of their children and be careful not to let them approach stray dogs or family dogs.</p>
<h3>Escaped Japanese Thief Arrested Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Informed by a Korean Man, Kim - Horita was Asleep When Arrested</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, after 53 days of rigorous investigation, the notorious escaped thief Horita Masao has been arrested. In addition to the police of the Consulate General being fully mobilized to search, the authorities of the settlements and the Chinese police stations were notified to offer rewards for his arrest, but his whereabouts were not found. Therefore, the Japanese residents criticized the police station of the Consulate General, and the police station also became the subject of various jokes because of this thief. During this time, Omori, the police officer in charge of guarding the thief, became ill due to the investigation, and other detectives, regardless of day or night, either distributed themselves at train stations and docks or boarded ships to check passengers. It can be said that they were exhausted. Unexpectedly, at 2 AM on the 2nd, Hoshi Einosuke, the Chief Inspector of the Judicial Department of the Consulate General, suddenly received a telegram from a Korean man named Kim living on Jing’an Temple Road, saying that Horita was there. Chief Inspector Hoshi was initially skeptical of the report, but he rushed to the reported location, where he was guided by Kim. He indeed found Horita wearing Chinese clothing, asleep in bed. The thief was taken to the police station. Because the thief was confused and had contracted venereal disease, the interrogation was postponed. However, it was heard that after escaping, the thief exchanged the more than 400 yuan in cash he carried with him at two exchange shops on Xiafei Road for Chinese legal tender, purchased five sets of Chinese clothing, one hat, and one pair of shoes, and stayed in brothels for several nights. Later, he wandered around rural farmhouses outside the city for food. Because his money had run out, he returned to the city, intending to visit a friend, but was finally arrested, it is said.</p>
<h3>Jin Su Appeals, Denying Mental Weakness</h3>
<p>Still Claims Yan Duhe Possesses Evil Magic</p>
<p>Jin Su, a registrar at the Jiangsu High Court in Suzhou, has been suffering from an incomprehensible disease in recent years, resulting in neurasthenia. Jin actually suspected that the disease was caused by the use of evil magic by Yan Duhe, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Xinwen Daily, which could not be resisted by human power. He repeatedly entangled with Yan. Although Yan tried to explain to him through letters and by asking people to persuade him, Jin remained obsessed. On April 25 of this year, at 1 PM, he secretly carried a pre-purchased file and waited at the entrance of the Xinwen Daily. When Yan arrived at the newspaper office, Jin immediately stepped forward and stabbed Yan's neck with the file. Yan resisted, causing the file to break in half inside his neck, resulting in injury. Jin was arrested on the spot and sent to the First Special Court, which sentenced Jin to six months in prison for harming the person's body, and imposed a guardianship measure for two years after the execution of the sentence. Jin refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. His main reasons were: (1) He stated that he did not have any mental weakness, which was determined by the forensic doctor; (2) He was certain that Yan possessed evil magic. His explanation was that the file used to commit the crime was purchased across the street from the Xinwen Daily and was extremely strong. Moreover, when he stabbed, he aimed at the boneless part of Yan's neck. Yet, the file was able to break. If Yan did not possess evil magic, how could it have broken, and so on. Yesterday morning, this case was heard by Judge Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court, together with the associate judge. Wu Zhiping, Yan Duhe's representative lawyer, also attended the court. Jin Su's testimony still insisted that he firmly believed that the pain he suffered was due to Yan's use of evil magic. Gan Jingxian, the acting lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the original trial sentenced the appellant according to Article 277 of the Criminal Law for ordinary injury. However, after investigating the appellant's behavior, it actually conformed to Article 278 of the Criminal Law for causing serious injury and should be punished according to law. The opinion of Inspector Lin Wopeng agreed with Gan's statement. After Judge Yu Hua reviewed the case, he announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment to be announced at 10 AM on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jiang Xiaojian Owes Payment, Affecting Students</h3>
<p>Students Resist and are Arrested - Trial Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaojian, an artist, lives at No. 383, North Baoxing Road, Zhabei. Because he owed Texaco 200 yuan in payment and failed to pay it, he was sued in the local court, and a judgment was made. After the execution status, he still did not deliver it. Therefore, the court sent clerk Chen Jing, along with bailiff Pan Jiaju, to implement the seizure on June 21. Jiang's student Cai Songjun tore off the seal and resisted the seizure. He was arrested and sent to the court to be prosecuted for obstructing official duties. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongyi held a trial. Defendant Cai Songjun confessed that because the teacher was not at home that day and the name on the seal did not match, he requested an investigation before the seizure was carried out the next day. They did not listen, so he prevented them from sealing it and did not tear off the seal. After the court debate, the sentence will be pronounced on the 6th of this month.</p>
<h3>Dai Jiaorong's Funeral Yesterday</h3>
<p>The body of Dai Dunrong, an employee of Taikoo Company who committed suicide by drowning in the Huangpu River a few days ago, was found at the original site (i.e., Pier 5, The Bund, Wuma Road) on the morning of the 1st. It was transferred to the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau by the Customs Water Patrol, and after the court examined it, it was claimed by the family. The body was sent to the Central Funeral Home for burial. The report was previously published. The funeral was held at 3 PM yesterday, and the body was temporarily placed in the Southern Funeral Home of the Siming Guild Hall, to be transported back to the original residence for burial at a later date. It was heard that all the Chinese employees of the company's ship's head office went to carry the coffin, with plain cars and white horses, and the mourning was extremely grand.</p>
<h3>Russian Former Northeast Army Pilot Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>Unemployed After the September 18th Incident, Came to Shanghai - Hospitalized for Smoking Cessation, Suddenly Fell Ill Again</p>
<p>A Russian, Lei Jin Pete Nikola Aivei District, (transliteration) 40 years old this year, previously served as a pilot in the aviation team under Zhang Xueliang of the Northeast Army in our country. Since the September 18th Incident, he has been unemployed and idle. Recently, he came to Shanghai. Because he was addicted to smoking, he was unable to find work. On the 14th of last month, he voluntarily checked into the Russian Hospital in the French Concession, requesting smoking cessation and accommodation in the hospital. After half a month, because of his recent poor circumstances, he suffered from heart disease and died at 9 AM on the 2nd. He had no family members. The hospital in Shanghai reported to the French Police Station, and the body was transferred to the hospital affiliated to the Shanghai Municipal Council's on Taras Road, where the corpse was examined. Yesterday, the Second Special Court was requested to send personnel to verify the facts. The body was buried by the Western Charities of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Three Thugs Assault Gatekeeper, Principal Culprit Arrested</h3>
<p>Because Ge Had Adultery with Zhang's Wife - Held a Grudge and Instigated Thugs to Commit Violence</p>
<p>Ge Yunjin, a Jiangbei gatekeeper at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Beile Road in the French Concession, Ruihua Lane, was suddenly attacked by three thugs at midnight on April 1 of last year. The thugs, under the false pretense of visiting a Zhu by the name of 24, Ruihua Lane, dragged Ge out of the lane, and used wooden sticks to assault Ge and forcibly seize Ge's pistol. Fortunately, Ge was very strong and resisted bravely. As a result, one of the assailants, Cao Zhiqing, and another, Pan Zhiyu, were arrested and taken to the police station, transferred to the Second Special Court for investigation. After the police station filed a public prosecution according to law, Cao and Pan were each sentenced to one year of slavery in the first trial. In the part of the civil lawsuit incidental to the victim, the two defendants were ordered to jointly compensate 57 yuan. Cao and Pan refused to accept the appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, resulting in the rejection of the declaration of probation. When Cao and Pan were tried in the first instance, they confessed that the instigator was the wife of Zhang Zifeng, who opened a tobacco shop at the entrance of Ruihua Lane, who was seduced by Ge, and held a grudge. Zhang ordered them to use force to warn her, but the main culprit escaped. For more than a year, the police station has been unable to find him. Until the 25th of last month, the enemies met on a narrow road. Ge Yunjin actually met Zhang Zifeng on the road and reported it to Chinese police No. 743, who arrested Zhang and brought him to the police station and sent him to the Second Special Court for trial and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao Xuan of the Criminal Court of the Criminal Court presided over the trial in the Criminal Court. The lawyer of the Police Department prosecuted for attempted murder. The victim, the plaintiff Ge Yunjin, filed a complaint about the victim's experience. The defendant denied the matter. The court ordered a change of date for the hearing on the morning of the 7th, summoning witnesses for further interrogation, and the defendant was sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Feng Zimei's Bigamy Case Transferred to Beiping Due to Wrong Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Divorce Deed has No Fingerprint, Obviously Forged - Lu Canjuan Has No Address, Feng Released on Bail by Lawyer</p>
<p>Lu Shuojuan, the former wife of Jin Liren, the former director of the Land Bureau of this city, (now renamed Jin Bi) had immoral behavior with the ballad singer Feng Zimei (also known as Hedongsheng, now renamed Jin Zhimin), resulting in Jin and Lu divorcing. After Lu separated from Jin, he went to Beiping with Feng and announced their cohabitation in the newspaper. Feng had an original wife named Zhang Qingbao. After detecting that Feng and Lu were living together, he hired lawyer Fan Gang to report to the Xinzha Police Station, who filed a lawsuit against Feng and Lu in the First Special Court for bigamy. At the trial in the Special Court, Feng stated that Lu and Lu were married at Yang Zhongjiu's house, No. 71 or 51, Xizhuan Hutong, Xuanwai, Beiping. Feng himself and Zhang Qingbao also made an appointment with lawyer Wang Ligong in Beiping to divorce. Therefore, the Special Court ordered a change of date to investigate in Beiping and re-examine it. Now, the Beiping Local Court has sent a reply to the Special Court. Therefore, yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the trial in the Criminal Court IV. The defendant Jin Bi did not arrive, only Feng Zimei arrived in court. According to the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu, the reply from the Beiping Local Court stated that the investigation revealed that there was no No. 71 in Xizhuan Hutong, only No. 51. Although there was a Yang woman living in the house, there was no Yang Zhongjiu. It is clear that the so-called marriage fact of the defendant is completely fictitious. Since there is no fact of marriage, the bigamy is fundamentally not established. Therefore, the police station intends to prosecute for adultery. Furthermore, the reply stated that lawyer Wang Ligong could not remember whether he had signed a divorce deed for both parties in this case, but according to lawyer Wang, all the agreements he signed had fingerprints, and those without fingerprints were all forged. The divorce certificate submitted by the defendant had no fingerprints, which was obviously forged. Therefore, the police station must also investigate the part of the forged document. Moreover, the defendant Jin Bi has no fixed address and did not appear in court today. Therefore, the police station requested that the court detain Feng Niangmei, that is, Jin Zhimin, who arrived in court today, for investigation. Feng confessed that Yang Zhongjiu's residence was actually 51 Lanman Hutong, and that he had misreported it last time. The court, with the facts clear, ordered that the debate on the bigamy be opened. The police lawyer Zhang said that the police station still needs to investigate, and the lawyer has no opinion on the court's judgment, but after the court's judgment, the defendant should be ordered to be released on bail. After verifying the confession, Judge Pan ordered that the case be transferred to the Beiping Local Court due to wrong jurisdiction. Jin Zhimin was released on bail by his defender, lawyer Ling Qihong.</p>
<h3>Songhu United Transport Car Overturns into River While Avoiding Ox Cart</h3>
<p>Female Passengers and Driver Slightly Injured</p>
<p>At 8:15 AM yesterday, a United Transport bus No. 10 (license plate Hu Yue 61010) of the Shanghai Company on Guohuo Road, heading to Songjiang, fell into the river at the Xiaogaoqiao area, about two miles from Chedun on Shisong Road, because it swerved to avoid an ox cart on the road. The driver tried to brake, but it was ineffective. More than 30 male and female passengers fell into the carriage, and those on the right side were crushed underneath, their clothes all wet. Several female passengers were trampled and injured. The driver, Hong Bingsheng, (from Jiading, 30 years old) suffered a large piece of torn flesh on his right arm due to excessive force, and blood poured out like a fountain. However, he was still conscious and first tried to pull out and rescue the passengers, helping to open the car door and rescue the public. After the company reported the incident, it immediately sent three ambulances and Chen Xueyu and Yan Shougen to the scene. The entire passengers had already been taken back by the Songjiang station and were comforted by Bai Tianyi and Du Ruozhou. According to the passengers, the driver was not at fault and voluntarily decided not to pursue the matter. They took out dry clothes and changed for the passengers. Several women who were trampled and injured were accompanied to nearby hospitals such as Joseph Rongcheng Hospital. After examination, they were found to be unharmed. Driver Hong Bingsheng returned to Shanghai after applying medicine and bandaging.</p>
<h3>Bao Zhang Accused of Assaulting and Humiliating Her Mother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Mrs. Zhang Wanted to Subjugate Her Husband - Resented and Beaten Her Mother-in-Law After Being Reproached</p>
<p>Bao Xingfeng, a native of Ningbo who is approaching 30, lives at No. 5, Shunyang Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. He married Zhang (23 years old this year) as his wife, and lives with Bao's mother, Lin (53 years old this year). Bao Zhang is usually quick-tempered, rude and outrageous, and often abuses her mother-in-law Lin. Besides all kinds of strange abuses, he wants to overwhelm her husband, hoping to subdue her husband and aunt in his grasp. Therefore, on the occasion of moving a few days ago, Bao Zhang actually pressed the birthday character lost under the toilet, in order to forever subdue her husband and fall under her skirt. Unexpectedly, it was discovered by her mother-in-law Bao Linmin, who gave her daughter-in-law a little scolding. How could Bao Zhang, out of shame and anger, push her mother-in-law to the ground and beat her severely, causing Linmin's chest to be seriously injured. Bao Lin reported it to the French police station. The patrol arrested Zhang a few days ago. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court VIII of the Second Special Court. Yuan Jiahuan, a lawyer from the Police Department, explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation. After Zhang Minsheng, a judge, interrogated both parties, he ordered the informant to send the injury to the forensic doctor for examination. The defendant Bao Zhang paid 200 yuan for the guarantee to be summoned at any time. If there is no guarantee, he will be detained, and the hearing will be changed to 8 AM on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Autopsy Result of Wu Yuanlong's Wife: Died of Drowning After Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Only Took Four Sleeping Pills, Which Should Not Be Fatal - Fainted After Taking the Pills, Drug Properties Suddenly Erupted</p>
<p>Wu Yuanlong married British woman Airmissay MasyL•Wu last year. However, at 11:30 PM on the afternoon of the 17th of last month, the woman suddenly went to the Xinya Hotel on North Sichuan Road, Tiantong Road, opened room 112, and committed suicide by taking sleeping pills in the spring. At the same time, she wrote a will, all of which were words of pressure to the world, and mailed it to her girlfriend (that is, the British wife of Qin Defang, the Chinese manager of the Public Welfare Yarn Factory). It was not until noon the next day that the hotel tea servant Zhang Chunlin discovered that she was lying stiffly in the bathtub. She immediately reported to the Hongkou Police Station and sent her to Gongji Hospital for treatment, where she died. The police detectives copied a bottle of sleeping pills from her lost bag, and four of them had been removed. The body was examined by the Second Special Court, which sent a prosecutor to examine the body, in order to be cautious and clarify the cause of death, it was specifically stated that the medical examiner should examine the corpse, and the details had been detailed in the newspaper. According to the autopsy by medical examiners Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, the stomach and intestines were sent to the laboratory of the Shanghai Municipal Council for testing. The results identified the cause of death as drowning after taking poison. A detailed study of the circumstances at the time revealed that the deceased entered the bathroom for a bath after taking the medicine. Due to the water heat, the drug properties suddenly erupted, resulting in unconsciousness and falling into the bathtub. Water then flooded the deceased's lungs and could not be saved. Without the drowning, even if four sleeping pills had been taken, it would not have caused death. Yesterday morning, Zhang, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, gave the examination report prepared by the two medical examiners Wei and Zhang to the detectives of the Hongkou Police Station in charge of the case for reference.</p>
<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Go to Court to Sue for Return of Deposit</h3>
<p>Defendant Unwilling to Pay - Court Adjourned for Another Hearing</p>
<p>No. 103, West Granary Street, No. 103, the number plate of the silk industry Wu Juren Wang Changfu, was sued in the local court by his daughter-in-law Wang Ling, (that is, Ling Juanhua, 29 years old,) for a deposit case. The main idea is that on April 12, 1931, she married the defendant's son Wang Jiajun, and had 2,000 taels of dowry silver and a one-button recommendation. She immediately took it back to the Qian residence. At the end of the year, due to interest settlement, it was taken away and saved by the defendant. Furthermore, when the price of gold soared, she gave the defendant gold ingots, Ruyi, pearl bracelets, etc., and received 205 yuan first. She also deposited her savings, Guanyi, 296 yuan, with the defendant for safekeeping, for a total of 3,300 yuan. Now, she suddenly induces the plaintiff to divorce her son, then the deposit can be returned, otherwise it will not be returned. Therefore, she requested the return of the deposit, etc. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng held a trial. According to the defendant Wang Changfu, he claimed to be 53 years old. The dowry was not enough for the Kun residence, so he sent the deposit. This was given by the plaintiff's family to the defendant's family and naturally used as dowry. The plaintiff completely made empty claims. If there is such a fact, evidence should be presented. There is also no such a large number of Guanyi, and there is no reason to hand it over to the defendant at all. There are jewelry, etc. At that time, because some of them were borrowed by Shenren, the woman returned some of them. In the 22nd year, because she saw that the relationship between her son and daughter-in-law was cold, fearing that other problems would occur in the future, she gave her daughter-in-law 2,000 yuan for a deposit, and the deposit book was given to the plaintiff for living expenses. However, the plaintiff is the defendant's daughter-in-law, so dealing with her in this way is very discouraging, so he is unwilling to pay, etc. The court adjourned and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<h3>New Venereal Disease Hospital Building</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Shanghai's first newly built specialist hospital for venereal diseases, employing French expert physicians and Chinese assistants to manage the hospital affairs, commenced operations on Friday. The hospital is located at the corner of Route Père Robert and Route Paul Beau, French Concession, and is modeled entirely after venereal disease hospitals in Paris. The construction cost exceeds 100,000 yuan, making it one of the largest hospitals of its kind in the world. Outpatient consultations are free. Venereal disease is one of Shanghai's biggest social problems, with a great many sufferers. Often, due to being mistreated by quack doctors, patients become permanently disabled. Now with this well-equipped hospital, patients can avoid sinking into the sea of suffering. The ground floor of the hospital houses a pharmacy, general medical clinic, and offices. The second and third floors are for patient rooms, and the top two floors are dormitories for resident doctors and staff. Medical professionals have long advocated for the establishment of such a hospital in Shanghai. The recent conference convened by the League of Nations in Java also extensively discussed this issue. The French Concession Municipal Council took the lead in addressing this need, and the Health Department has been planning this initiative for over two years.</p>

<p>李源, a policeman from the 滬西 曹家渡 police station, was dispatched on the 27th of last month at around 2:00 PM to direct traffic at the 五角塲 intersection on Route Paul Brunat. He recorded the number of trolleybus #83 of the 16th route because the driver was not following instructions. Unexpectedly, the driver got off the trolleybus, assaulted 李源 on the temple, jumped back on the trolleybus, and fled. 李源 immediately returned to the station to report to Director 賈.

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>(Thirty-One)</p>
<p>Question: Mr. 張彬 from Tianjin wrote, stating that he needs to refer to the International Postal Convention but does not know which book it is contained in. Please advise.</p>
<p>Answer: The current International Postal Convention was formulated by postal representatives of various countries at a conference held in Cairo, Egypt, in March 1934. The conventions and agreements that the Chinese postal service participates in include the International Postal Convention, the International Exchange Parcel Agreement, the International Remittance Agreement, and the International Exchange Insured Letter and Box Agreement. These conventions and agreements are sold at postal administrations throughout the country for a total of 50 cents in national currency. If you need to consult them, you can purchase them from the Tianjin Hebei Postal Administration.</p>
<p>Question: The postal service's handling of simple life insurance allows ordinary middle and lower-class people to prepare for life's uncertainties, which is a good intention. I am a small salaried employee, 32 years old, and plan to allocate 1.45 yuan from my monthly living expenses to join whole life insurance. I wonder what the insurance amount will be in the future. Also, whole life insurance lasts for a very long time, and life is unpredictable. If after joining, I am unable to continue paying premiums due to unemployment or other reasons and want to recover the amount already paid, is it possible and what are the conditions? Please provide detailed information.</p>
<p>Answer: If you are 31 years old and purchase whole life insurance, paying a monthly premium of 1.4 yuan, you will receive 485.8 yuan in the future. If you are unable to continue paying premiums due to unforeseen circumstances and want to recover the amount already paid, you should first fill out an application to cancel the insurance contract, together with the insurance documents, and submit them to the original insurance bureau for review by the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Then, following the prescribed procedures, you can collect the accumulated money owed to you from the original insurance bureau. The conditions are as follows: 1. Premiums must have been paid for two years (i.e., the application for cancellation must be made after two years from the effective date of the insurance contract). 2. If premiums have been paid for two years but less than three years, 80% of the accumulated money will be received. Based on this calculation, for each additional year that premiums are paid in full, an additional 1% will be added, up to 98%. Also, if the insured person is temporarily unable to pay premiums, there is no need to cancel the insurance contract. The contract can be changed, i.e., whole life can be changed to term, or the premium can be reduced, or payment can be temporarily suspended and continued within one year to avoid giving up halfway.</p>
<h3>Unifying the Angle of the Party and National Flags</h3>
<p>The citizens of the South District of this city convened a joint meeting of representatives from various public organizations in the South City to prepare for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Shanghai Municipal Government and organized the Shanghai South City Citizens Celebration of the Municipal Government 10th Anniversary Preparatory Committee, with 張嗚欽 and 姚光鼎 responsible. In addition to actively building over fifty decorated arches and filling the city with lanterns, they paid particular attention to unifying the angle of the Party and National flags. The announcement is excerpted below: "Announcement regarding the fact that the Party flag and the National flag are the emblems representing the Chinese Kuomintang and the Republic of China, and all citizens should respect and display them. The timing and method should be in accordance with the Regulations on the Manufacture and Use of Party and National Flags promulgated by the Central Government and should not be violated. However, it has been found that shops and households in this city often do not pay attention to the method of using the Party and National flags, showing disrespect and causing international ridicule. This has been corrected through a joint announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Social Bureau, and Police Bureau, Municipal Character No. 7336. This Committee believes that the reason why shops and households are unable to comply with the Central Government's regulations for displaying the Party and National flags is the lack of appropriate tools, and it is not an intentional violation. Therefore, it has been decided to commission the 樂羣 Scientific Research Society to design and manufacture flag holders and flagpoles in accordance with the regulations, set a minimum price for labor and materials, distribute them to various shops, and send people to install them to achieve uniformity. As the 10th anniversary of the Municipal Government approaches, there will be many foreign visitors. International appearances are even more important. We hope that all shops and households will recognize the overall situation and adopt them uniformly, so as not to violate the clear orders of the Party and government authorities and to show respect for the spirit of the Party and the nation. Fearing that this may not be fully known, this is specially announced." According to the person in charge of the Committee, the flagpoles and flag holders are absolutely not for profit-making purposes. One flagpole only recovers the cost of 15 cents. The iron flag holder is very heavy and recovers a cost of 30 cents. If installed on a wooden door, the installation fee is 2 cents. For a cement brick wall, the installation fee is 10 cents. The fact that a bamboo pole on the market costs several cents more than 30 cents is definitely not the Committee's intention to rectify and unify. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.</p>
<h3>楊方朱 Organizes the Asia Electrochemical Industry Research Institute</h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese youth 楊方朱 has been studying electrochemistry for a long time and has gained considerable insights. Recently, he invented the "Vaporized Cuprous Oxide Rectifier" and "Carbon Resistor," which have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for patent registration. These inventions occupy an important position in electrical engineering and radio engineering and have always been imported, resulting in the outflow of profits, which is regrettable. Now, Mr. 楊 has worked hard to research and invent them, and they can save a lot of money each year. Mr. 楊 has now organized a "Asia Electrochemical Industry Research Institute" with a preparatory office located at No. 21 Jing'an Temple Lane in this city to purchase application machines. Products will be available around the beginning of August.</p>

<h3>In a Small Town</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>Walking on the dry, scorching yellow mud ground, having traveled all day, I felt a wave of relief at this moment, quietly saying to myself: "Ah, I've arrived, this ancient small town."</p>
<p>The watery dusk was like ripples ruffled by the wind, and the mouse-grey shadows faintly flew up to the eaves of the city gate tower. The deep blue sky had already lost the last flash of red light from the sun, and the twilight, accompanied by the mournful cries of crows, welcomed the coming of night under the sparse stars.</p>
<p>Adjusting the knapsack and umbrella on my back, crossing the small stone bridge over the moat, the cave-like city gate was dark and deep, like a man-eating monster opening its mouth wide, waiting for something. Next to the thick wooden door, eroded by insects, two soldiers in grey uniforms with sallow faces guarded their posts, scrutinizing me, this wanderer, with sharp eyes. One of them, putting on a solemn air, asked:</p>
<p>"Hey, brother-in-law, where are you coming from?"</p>
<p>Before I could answer this barbaric fellow, a man with a red ribbon slung across his shoulder came over to search my bag. The shirt and pants, hardened by sweat and dust, emitted a musty odor in the evening breeze. The man waved his hand in disgust, and I smiled apologetically, stepping into this dilapidated small town.</p>
<p>The streets were narrow, and someone often spilled excrement under the eaves of their houses, with a gust of embarrassing stench blowing towards me. Small shops on both sides hung up signs for "big sales." From the cross-street to the south, a dozen black-haired, big-eared fat pigs ran over, their shovel-like mouths digging through the piles of garbage on the street. The pig dealers followed behind, whipping their leather whips. The pigs ran past, chased by the dealers, and the dust rose like cooking smoke, flying to heaven and then slowly falling back down.</p>
<p>A peddler, who traded broken shoes and dog skin for bamboo baskets, let out a strange cry, and the wild dogs at the entrance of the alley started barking incessantly.</p>
<p>In front of the "Lai Fu Inn," which hung a pair of red paper lanterns, a waiter took my luggage. Without allowing me to say anything, he dragged me straight into a courtyard filled with livestock and carts. He pulled back the cloth curtain of a mud-brick east-facing room and said with a greasy smile:</p>
<p>"Sir, take a look, you won't find a better room than this in the whole county. If you do, I'll call you Dad."</p>
<p>I nodded and took the room. When I opened the bedding and spread it on the yellowed, damp mat, the waiter placed a grey earthenware teapot on the windowsill. After I tiredly lay down, he leaned close to my face and said softly:</p>
<p>"Sir, would you like to relieve some boredom? Even though they're local goods, they're clean! I'll call two over for you to take a look at, a little</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>something."</p>
<p>I waved my hand, and he rolled his eyes, stopping, but still unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>"Sir, if you're tired, I'll bring a lamp for you, to relieve your fatigue first. Truly from the west of the pass."</p>
<p>I disappointed him in everything. He slammed the door curtain down in near anger and walked into the courtyard, grumbling under his breath: "What a tightwad!"</p>
<p>This small town was so old that it was about to collapse. It was like a fruit infested with maggots, rotting little by little from the core outwards...</p>
<h3>Shade</h3>
<p>— 申氷</p>
<p>Sunlight blazes at the heart of midday. I seek the source of light and heat in the shade of trees, just as I seek the raindrops passing before my eyes from under an umbrella. Ignorant of past memories, I feel my dark brown skin has become pale, my abundant hair bald, and that I suffer from an incurable anemia.</p>
<p>The aerial roots of the old tree hang down like tassels, parallel and staggered. In the flourishing midday, it quietly forms a patch of shade. It encircles me, coldly suppressing my leaping life. I feel as if I am a prisoner, with an iron chain inexplicably weighing down my ankle.</p>
<p>Through the dense trees, I pick up lines of sunlight like seashells. But as the shadows sway, I seek light and heat, and obtain only shade and cold water. Those cycles of days and months, the comings and goings, the mornings and evenings, the witherings and flourishings, are all unknown and unattainable to me. The world sinks into the twilight sky, without hope, as if remaining in peace. I utter a silent complaint, like a wisp of black mist, merging into the black mist-filled sky. I am seeking the source of light and heat.</p>
<p>So I begin a confused trek. I am already pursuing light and heat. I have never looked back at my footprints, nor have I wiped a single tear from my eyelids. With my dark brown skin and abundant hair as proof, I pursue light and heat.</p>
<p>I am no longer as cold as a gecko or a snake. Blood is once again leaping in my veins, and my laughter is healthy, under the sunlight filled with light and heat.</p>
<p>Sometimes I will place a few playful coins on a fortune-telling stall, and I will grab onto an old blind man, pestering him to know where my light and heat are, whether in the distant distance or already before my eyes, with my dark brown skin and abundant hair as proof.</p>
<p>A spark of fire shines before my eyes, scattering overlapping light, seemingly so close, close before my eyes. Weary travelers should not doubt or delay, for the sake of that single spark of fire; but that spark is distant, burning distantly in the distance, and gleaming closely before my eyes.</p>
<p>Life eternally treks along a rugged path, relying on that enticing spark.</p>
<p>I feel disheartened. Those lights and heats, those hopes and expectations, life and leaping blood, I have gained nothing. What I have won is a handful of ashes.</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday; the June wind blew through the quiet courtyard, the sun's tentacles caressing the eaves, and there were shadows of the balustrades, drawn in the sunlight. In such a day, I began the first day of my life.</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday; I carried my schoolbag, my face glowing, squeezed into the small group of lives, often seeing those overlapping backs, 牛似地 walking towards the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday; I didn't put my fingers in my mouth to gnaw on them. I have teeth, I have a taste, seeing girls passing by, I would breathe like a bellows. I have written affectionate poems for sideburns, eyebrows, and waists.</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday; but yesterday is so far away, so far away.</p>
<p>Today is my twentieth birthday. As birthday gifts, my father and mother sent two packages from afar. I solemnly unwrapped them separately.</p>
<p>In an exquisite box lay an exquisite little watch, along with a small note that violated postal regulations, which read:</p>
<p>"Child, cherish this little watch! Treasure your time."</p>
<p>Excitement made me open the second package. My father gave me a crude compass. I stared blankly at the trembling magnetic needle.</p>
<p>"Pay attention to direction!"</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>邢俊明 "Anecdotes of Chinese and Foreign Celebrities"</p>
<p>東陸 (800) 12:40 PM to 1:15 PM</p>
<p>"Lady Fei"</p>
<p>Emperor Sizong sent his son away and returned to Kunning Palace, where he saw Empress Zhou had already hanged herself and was dead. He cried "Good, good, good." Then he went to Shuning Palace to see Princess Changping. At that time, the princess was weeping bitterly, with only Fei Zhen'e at her side. Sizong approached the princess and said, "My child, you are already fifteen years old this year. Born into my family, how unfortunate..." He choked up at this point, unable to speak, raised his left sleeve to cover his face, and with his right hand, drew his sword and slashed directly at the princess. The princess hurriedly reached out to block, and her left arm was severed, and she fainted to the ground. Sizong's hand trembled, and he could no longer slash. He then went to the West Palace and lost his temper again, killing many concubines. The entire palace spread the news that the Emperor was running amok, and everyone fled in terror.</p>
