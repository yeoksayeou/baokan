<p>中央社南京九日軍、軍息、㊀敵方開滬侵略作戰之部隊、共計六個師團、其已參戰者為第二、第六、第十一、第十九各師團、另增之兩師團亦已到滬、㊁八日敵由滬江大學沿軍工路兩側、猛襲我觀音堂路一帶陣地、經我軍擊退、虬江碼頭之敵進犯時、亦被我擊退、㊂六日在寶山城內全營殉難者、係九十八師某團之姚子靑營、㊃七日由南泗塘河進犯之敵、係名古屋第三師團之第六聯隊、計為我擊斃八九百人、奪獲步槍二十餘支、迫擊砲一門、㊄吳淞之敵、八日晨以重砲戰車、向我陣地襲犯、金家宅前之陣地被突破我軍、現在小顧宅陣地奮勇反攻、至九日晨將全家宅陣地克復、敵方傷亡極重、㊈沙龍港口附近敵艦二十餘艘、自七日晚澈夜向我月浦陣地射擊、八日晨更烈、繼以戰車八輛掩護、由寶山沿公路兩側、向月浦進犯、雙方激戟甚烈、現仍對峙中、㊆羅店無變化、</p>
<h3>敵沿軍工路反攻經我夾擊潰退江邊</h3>
<p>昨晨五時、浦江敵艦、又頻頻向我市中心區陣地攻擊、同時小股敵軍約計四五百人、利用坦克車五輛、由軍工路觀音堂等處、向我軍進犯、七時敵兵前哨到達春江路附近、陸家觀音堂後面、我守軍□旅沉着應戰、俟其迫近時、從楊家宅衝出、向敵軍猛烈攻擊、頑敵在我機槍掃射、手溜彈迫擊砲襲擊之下、傷亡枕藉、生還無幾、</p>
<p>據某軍車機關得報、昨晨五時浦中敵艦會同飛機、向我軍工路，五權路·以及觀音橋一帶陣地、大施轟炸、同時復有大隊步兵向馮家宅十字路口攻擊、移時又有一部敵軍向張家宅進犯、當時沈家行鎮我軍、立卽出動、分向敵軍左側及背面猛力進撲、有進無還、敵倉皇應戰、陣綫立刻動搖、我軍乘勝追擊、敵遂不支、向江邊潰退、又觀音橋方面、我與敵軍仍在虬江兩岸對峙中、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晨五時許、虬江碼頭江面之敵艦、開砲向我軍工路五權路及觀音堂路一帶轟擊、敵機亦飛隊上空轟炸、同時虬江碼頭方面之敵、卽在敵機及砲火掩護之下、向我馮家宅十字路口進攻、我軍誘敵深入、卽行後退、敵軍追踪、到達張家宅附近、我沈家行之駐軍、卽由東北向敵軍左側背突擊、敵軍處於我軍夾擊之中、受創甚鉅、乃卽倉皇向江邊潰退、迄晚未敢來犯、至於觀音橋方面、則敵我仍隔虬江而對峙云、</p>
<p>引翔鄉方面八日激戰之結果、除赫村宅早經我軍攻克外、周家宅之敵軍、業已全部肅淸、而沈家宅一帶、亦僅留少數殘敵、是日我軍在該處斃敵計達八九百人云、</p>
<h3>敵犯閘北又未得逞</h3>
<p>昨午八時許、寶山路一帶、敵我又起激戰、敵分數路由東寶興路吟桂路等綫、向我陣地進襲　我見敵迫近、卽以迫擊砲及機關槍迎擊、使敵不能前進、並憑所築工事、與敵遙遙對峙、至約三時、槍聲靜寂、惟敵則頻以大砲亂轟近晚始止、</p>
<p>閘北靑雲路八字橋一帶、昨日下午六時至七時之間、敵我兩軍又發生激戰、一時機關槍砲聲、密如聯珠、該處附近民房、被敵砲擊中、燃燒甚烈、</p>
<h3>蕰藻洪敵軍受重創</h3>
<p>蕰藻浜方面、昨晚激戰甚烈、我右翼□師已進展至蕰藻浜曹家宅附近、在該方面發生極猛烈之血戰、敵雖以重砲向我軍猛轟、我軍陣地、亳無損害、王家浜附近、砲戰亦甚猛烈、</p>
<p>淞口敵艦於八日砲擊我蕰藻浜北之曹家宅、我亦卽以重砲向王家浜一帶敵軍陣地轟擊、敵方受創甚鉅、</p>
<h3>羅店方面激戰我軍收復長橋等地</h3>
<p>羅店方面之我軍、前日（八日向鎭北約計二公里之長橋進攻、在吳家宅坦石橋小金唐宅以西一帶、與敵軍千餘人激戰、我軍始以來福槍及機關槍射擊、繼以手溜彈向敵猛襲、最後以刺刀衝鋒肉搏、卒於傍晚將長橋克復、同時我一部之士兵、卽乘黑夜越滬太路、而收復長橋北首約一公里之封家宅、此次血戰整日之結果、我軍以衝鋒勇猛、加之三面受敵、致有連長一人、排長二人、士兵一百六十餘人、作壯烈之犧牲、然敵軍亦遺屍遍地、傷亡之數、數倍於我云、</p>
<p>昨據嘉定鄉間逃出之難民稱、伊經羅店顧家鎭沿滬太路逃出、該處沿途一帶、並無日兵、所有守衛之兵士、均係中國軍隊、日兵現已退至羅店鎭東北六里許之海邊、惟該處自發生戰事後、死傷兵民衆多、田野間臭不可聞、徧地皆係死屍、且多數棄諸浜中、故河浜之水皆不可飲、花田均已結實、無人收割、棄財於地、良可惜也、</p>
<p>中央社南京八日電、軍息、㊀張華浜之敵約一旅、七日上午八時、分八處、每處步乓約一連、利用橡皮等渡過北泗塘河、向我陣地襲擊、我軍奮勇反攻、激戰終日、將渡河之敵、完全擊退、此役敵軍傷亡約近千人、</p>
<h3>我擊退敵鐵甲車隊</h3>
<p>寶山月浦鎭一帶之敵、八日以鐵甲車八輛、向我陣地鍾犯、被我軍以迫擊砲密集轟擊、敵車燬傷甚重、遂將其擊退、</p>
<p>八日、敵鐵甲車八輛、在寶山縣至月浦鎭一帶出沒、後隨步兵、屢向我陣地進犯、我當以迫擊砲密集轟擊、敵車頗受損傷、紛紛潰退、卒未得逞、</p>
<h3>浦東擊退登陸敵軍</h3>
<p>確息、昨日上午十一時許、有敵軍一小部、由浦中敵艦掩護之下、在浦東三井碼頭、偷渡登岸、我守軍俟其上陸立足未穩時、卽以密結機槍掃射、該敵稍事抵抗後、遂狼狽逃回、此役敵軍被我擊斃六名、我軍僅死一人、（又訊）昨日午後零時十五分、又有一汽艇、載日兵七名、直向陸家嘴春江碼頭駛來、迨離岸僅四尺時、我哨兵卽用機槍掃射、該艇遂疾駛逸去、至午後三時、敵機四架、又飛至浦東上空盤旋、在其昌棧一帶投彈數枚而去、</p>
<h3>我空軍昨來滬助戰</h3>
<p>我空軍於昨午後五時許來滬助戰、由西而東、經過浦江上空時、敵艦高射砲及機關槍亂發、當時租界中區頗有流彈及鐵片落下、幸均不在鬧市、故未釀大禍、據記者調査、在福州路花旗總會門首、傷西人兩名、漢口路中南銀行前、傷皮匠及報版等三人、巡捕房救護車立時出動、車送傷者入醫院急治、</p>
<p>我空軍昨夜今晨、兩度來滬、在浦江上空與敵艦發生激戰第一次在十一時三十分許乍聞高射砲之聲砰砰不絕、知我機來襲、惟約五分鐘卽行靜寂、一小時後砲聲又起、例如連珠、而信號彈及探海燈一時齊發、耀如閃電、我機亦以機關槍還擊、格格之聲、發于雲際、戰況甚爲激烈、我機卽翔數匝、卽行安然馳去、均未投彈、當時有隆隆之聲、則係我軍所發之重砲、藉敵艦所發信號爲標的而描凖轟擊者、聞敵艦被我夾攻、頗有損傷云、</p>
<h3>敵機械化部隊抵滬</h3>
<p>據確報、沙龍港附近、有敵機二十餘艘、昨晚向我陣地猛轟、匯山碼頭又有敵軍四千餘人登陸、大部份為機械化部隊、</p>
<p>敵軍在滬苦戰近月、迄無進展、屢次向國內迄援、已陸續開到、茲據確息、八日上午、又有運輸艦四艘、駛進浦江、在黃浦及大阪兩碼頭上岸、聞該批大部係機械化部隊、數約四千五百人之多、均携有新式之武器、想日內當更肆其殘暴之殺人手段、以圖最後之一逞、</p>
<h3>美孚油棧中彈起火</h3>
<p>中央社云、浦江敵艦於昨日傍晚突以大砲向我浦東方面陣地轟擊、當有數彈落於其昌棧後之美孚油棧、當卽起火、至深夜尚有延燒中、敵軍漫無標的之砲擊、每仗各國在滬之企業受重大損害、聞各國企業家紛請政府提出交涉云、</p>
<h3>華成烟公司遭焚燬</h3>

<h3>我空軍夜襲敵艦一艘受重傷</h3>
<p>敵佔高爾夫塲停飛機被　我炸燬飛機十餘架</p>
<p>前晚（八日）七時零五分、我飛機兩架飛至浦江施行轟炸、當有一彈投中明華糖廠、立卽爆發、詳情已誌昨報、査該廠貯藏敵軍軍用品甚夥、並駐有軍隊、又據昨日調査所得、浦江中有一大號敵艦、亦中彈重傷、</p>
<p>確息、我機一隊、前晚昨晨數度向浦江敵艦投彈、昨晨一時許、我機又飛至楊樹浦敵飛機塲矗炸、投下四彈轟然聲中、黑烟突起、塲內停放之敵機、炸燬十餘架、敵驚覺後、大放高射砲、我機已安然成功飛返、</p>
<p>中央社云、據確悉、我空軍昨晨零時許、數度出現於浦江、向敵轟炸、曾在楊樹浦路底滬江大學附近敵臨時建築之飛機塲內、投下四彈、當卽起火、炸燬敵機十餘架云、中央社云、我機一隊、前晚昨晨三度飛臨浦江、乘敵不備、猛施矗炸、有數彈當卽爆發、聲震全市、顯然觸及其目的物、頃據確息、浦江中有大號之敵艦一艘、已受重傷、當係受我軍轟炸所致、</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日軍現復取一二八戰事之行動、將滬江大學附近之高爾夫球塲改為飛行降落地、聞將供其在上海區域作戰之陸軍飛機需用、另在崇明島築一飛行塲、據可靠方面消息、日昨高爾夫球塲停有各式飛機約十二架、尚有若干架、正在由楊樹浦運艦上卸下、</p>
<p>頃從可靠方面得悉敵方在楊樹浦公大紗廠與軍工路之間、就原有之高爾夫球塲、改作臨時飛機塲、業經竣工、於前日起停有陸上機數架、隨時聽候敵陸軍方面命令起飛作戰、又悉敵第十六師團指揮下之第三航空團、係新自日本國內增援而來、已有大部抵滬、卽利用此臨時飛行塲爲楊樹浦之航空根據地、昨日盤旋南市閘北虬江碼頭之大型轟炸機、卽由該處起飛者、</p>
<h3>敵機慘炸松江站後路局修復通車</h3>
<p>開京開杭客車改晚間開出　敵機一架昨飛臨平站偵察</p>
<p>敵機前日在松江車站、炸毀由滬開杭之客車五輛、傷亡無辜難民逾七百餘人、實係我交通界空前浩劫、而暴敵之肆意屠殺非戰鬥人員、凡屬稍具人性之國民、均不直其所為、當時松江車站亦被毀甚鉅、兩路管理局獲訊後、卽派工程車及救護車、冒險趕往、先將受傷難民、救至附近醫院診治、再淸除路軌、並趕工修理、至昨午始行修復通車、該局為行旅安全起見、於昨日起、改用客車兩次、因白晝有空襲之危險、故改在夜間開行、每日下午六時三十分開杭、七時開京、均仍在西站上車、又悉昨晨十時二十分、有敵機一隊、飛滬杭路臨平站偵察、惟未投彈、約二分鐘、卽向東而去、其時杭市已發出空襲警報、嚴予戒備、以敵機已折返、故亦卽解警云、</p>
<p>又據乘客云、西站買票甚為困難、有候至兩小時而未能買得而登車者、頗望路局之設法改善云、</p>
<h3>敵機野蠻行為全世界豈能容忍</h3>
<p>日本國際地位愈形孤立　為無辜平民之鮮血所污</p>
<p>英文大美映報云、當日飛機轟炸南車站時、獨立之觀察者、未見該處有一士兵、僅有可憐之難民數百人、死傷於彼等零星之行李堆中　吾人曾稱之為謀殺、日飛機前日又在松江轟炸由滬開出之難民火車、聞死者三百人、傷者四百人、英文中實無一字足以形容、此種行動、其野蠻實聞所未聞、亳無軍事目的、傷天害理、無以復加、全世界必為之默然震駭、蓋實無話可說、唯有驚痛而已、彼作惡者其將設詞以自文其過乎、但事實昭彰、斷不能减輕此種違背上帝之罪惡也、其間並無軍用火車、亳無理由可疑及此點、無論如何、彼駕軍用飛機者、用其慘烈之武器、加害平民、其責任斷不能逃避、自英大使受傷後、此種敎訓、更不能推諉、假使中國業已宣戰、猶可言也、今則雙方並未宣戰、並未聲明作戰之目的、並未以機會給予無助之非戰鬥人士避至可認為安全之區域、此種罪惡、實萬不可恕、質言之、今日實無一地可認為安全者矣、雙方之未正式實戰也、或屬佳事、但今乃恣意屠殺無辜、而使平民死傷纍纍、此實戰事中從來所未聞之事、戰爭死傷總數、往日雖有視今為多者、惟彼等皆係戰士、或戰士居其多數、初不料一九三七年中國之戰事、中國男女平民與小孩、竟遭若是之慘禍也、據現情觀之、此種轟炸難民火車所釀成之慘禍、茍全世界能知之者、似可促起外方一種堅決行動、此種破壞戰爭規則之行為、此種較森林道德更為卑劣之惡魔降臨、在人類天良上、實不能容忍、今所恐者、世界人士至少暫時尚不能相信此間之遭遇、將覺此復為一偶然事件、但此豈為偶然事件乎、此其為憑藉任何不能相信之手段、以圖擊破中國抵抗堅志的一種酷冷決心之表示首、其足堅中國抵抗之志者、孰有較此更甚者乎、吾人處此戰爭中、恒以公允之道對待雙方、此為吾人之政策、吾人時受雙方指摘、謂對於他方、過於寬容、但轟炸南車站之擧、吾人實不能加以恕宥、而轟炸難民火車、吾人視之、似更兇暴、吾人甚至不能聽取彼方之辯詞、蓋事實顯明、不容再辯、日本今已爲全世界所唾罵、今次之擧、雖愛之者亦不能為之辯也、日本今已孤立、而為無辜平民之鮮血所污矣、</p>

<p>不逃避九國公約責任　撤僑在應付和平團體</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國官員今日對於上海美僑所謂美國在遠東聲望一事、均不願公開表示意見、但一致相信、美國政府决定留駐軍艦在華、且隨時採取堅決外交行動、凡此均足以維護美國之利益與原則及條約權利、反之、大批美僑居留中國、旣不足維護美國之威望、且足引起危險、致使美政府處境、發生糾紛、而不能進遇自如、萬一美僑不撤退而發生事件、則必使國內輿論要求總統施行中立法、此舉對於美國在遠東之聲望與勢力所受打擊、必較撤僑為尤大、美國政府苦陷入此種境地、則無異逃避九國公約所規定保障中國主權之責任、蓋九國公約者、美國實其發起人也、况卽無事件發生、國內要求施行中立法者、已使政府難以應付、若再有美國人民死傷、則羅斯福總統與國務部長赫爾必不能繼續拒絕此種要求、上海美僑實不解國內對於中立及避免戰爭之强大政治要求、而羅斯福總統上星期日在勃洛克島之談話、實欲以答復此種要求、惟其眞意、與國務部長赫爾迭次宣言、並無出入、不過語氣較為堅强、藉以使國內和平團體·報紙評論家·及反政府派·稍安毋躁耳、總統一言、現已在國內奏效、例如六和平團體已於今日上書總統、謂“國外美僑、稱君撤僑一舉為懦弱、惟吾人則稱之為常識、蓋保護全國利益、而不斤斤於少數人民之利益、實非懦弱也”云、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>［紐約］現已退職之美國少將史特林、今日在紐約太陽報發表一文、題為對日干涉可能乎、氏首先比較英美法日之海軍力量、繼斷言日本所以敢於在華自山行動肆無忌憚者、即由日本深知歐洲各國聯合對付日本之可能性甚少、是以今日日本所以能橫行於東亞之故、繩由歐美各國不能確定其在遠東之政策及以各國之海軍爲後盾所造成、氏未謂歐美各國　之諒解、並非不可能茍其互成為事實、而以其聯合艦隊逼使日本中止其對華之侵略暴行、則日本非至於自殺、必至於屈服也、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>［紐約］紐約公論報今日計日本對英所趕覆文、其言曰、自此覆文內容觀之、日本顯然預料英關於今日歐洲局勢下、對日不致保取嚴峻步驟、按日本發動其對華侵略之初、英國正陷於極度之經濟恐慌中、至於放棄其金本位、及日本進行其第二步之對華侵略計劃時、英國又為意大利之併吞阿比西尼亞所糾緾、至於今日、則又為兩班牙內戰及此種戰事所造成之意德與蘇俄矛盾關係所困縛、英國每於日本大肆其對華暴行時、輒有意外之牽制以掣其肘、亦可謂不幸之至矣、故今日日本對於英國所提關於許閣森大使受傷之牒文與要求、儘可熟視無睹、置若罔聞、一如一九三一年時日本對於美國務部長虫汀生之照會同、（八日國民電）</p>

<h3>救濟難民問題</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>從抗戰開始各處軍事地帶就發生了大批的難民。這些都是因戰事而失去了生計的。目前就以上海一地而論。最少也在十幾萬人左右。這十幾萬人。現在雖然已經從戰區中逃出性命來了。然而茫茫前途。又何處是他們的歸程呢。難民留在都市裏專靠收容救濟。自然不是一個辦法。就是像目前這種無計劃的遣散回鄕。又豈是一個善策。此種無計劃的遣散。結果不過是甲地少一批難民與乙地多一批難民而已。對於難民這個嚴重問題。根本就依然沒有解决。而且目前的抗戰。决不是一個局部局地的事。今日甲地可以成爲戰區。明日乙地又何嘗不能成爲戰區。然則又將由乙地遣散於丙地了。這樣轉輾遷移。結果祇見難民日益加多。後方愈益紛擾而已。</p>
<p>因此。根本的救濟難民。决不是專靠消極的收容與遣散所能奏效。而必須由積極的方面入手。纔可以徹底的解决。這所謂積極的辦法。可以分爲兩點來說。</p>
<p>第一。是使已經成爲難民的人。能够重獲生計之路。</p>
<p>第二。是使尙未成爲難民的人。不再變成難民。</p>
<p>關於第一點。最近行政院已通過了一個非常時期救濟難民辦法。主要的內容是。㊀在首都設救濟委員會總會。各地設分支會。辦理救濟事宜。㊁難民之無工作能力者。就地收容。或移鄰近地帶。㊂難民之有工作能力者。參酌人數工作環境妥爲分配。派往所屬鄕鎭協助生產或輸送事業。或於各地防衛組織及其他團體內。分配工作。㊃難民願服兵役者代爲照料其家屬。㊄難民失學兒童。給予以敎育㊅救濟總會費用係動用中央救災凖備金及指撥專款或募捐。分會費用係動用原有救濟機關與善團基金及地方救災基金竝得募捐。這一個辦法。自然是一個很積極的措置。假若果能有條不紊的按法而行。我們想成效一定是有的。不是。我們在這裏還不能不再提出一些補充的意見。㊀這項辦法中。還欠規定總分會間的關係（縣支會已規定由省分會統籌）正因爲這次的抗戰。是整個的全面的無論任何一切。都應該有一個統一的計劃。譬如說。那一些地方可以安揷無工作能力的難民。又譬如有工作能力的難民。應該到那一些地方去生產。生產些什麼。這種種都必須要全國統盤的籌劃。而由總會决定。發交分支會執行纔是。假若同現在這樣的不規定關係。而各省各自爲政的時候。恐怕將來結果會發生許多缺點的。㊁對於難民中之熟練的機械勞動者。應該有一種特殊的處置。這些人不但不應該讓他們分散或者讓他們從事其他的工作。而且應該迅速的命令集中後方。這種勞動者不唯他自身是戰時產業中的工作員。同時還可以由他們養成許多新的機械勞動者。加大戰時生產的力量。㊂我們以爲有工作能力的難民。在沒有分配到工作以前。應該由救濟會計劃指定適當的塲所。依職業分類集合。譬如依農民。紡織工人。火柴工人等而分類集合。其同職人數過少者。可將類似職業者集合一處。這樣。在需要工作人員的時候。就可以很迅速的召集到。</p>
<p>關於第二點如何使尙未成爲難民的人。不再變成難民。這個問題。政府尙無適宜的辦法頒布。但我們似乎也有幾點意見可以貢獻。㊀在最近之將來有成爲戰區可能的地方。應該預籌辦法。從事於人民的組織。譬如以農民來說應速使各村各鄕先專組織團結與籌劃未來發展的地方。這樣一旦到變故臨頭就可以很快集團的退向新目的地。再事生產。又譬如說工廠罷。那未可以先遷的就應該先遷。否則。應預先組織工人。計劃未來的去處。到敵人逼來前的五分鐘。用最迅速的手段。將全體人員機械原料撤退到新目的地。假若能够這樣未雨綢繆的做。决不至弄得像今日上海難民的那樣狼狽。㊁各地的工廠商店機關。在現在這個非常時期對於全體人員可以减薪或加工。但應嚴禁裁員。我們知道。多裁一員。卽事喪失一個人或一家的生計。亦卽多一個或一羣的難民。在目前這個時候。寧願每一個人少吃一碗飯。但有飯必須要大家吃。最近上海就有些商店機關。名義上薪水不折不扣。但有形無形的已裁去了許多人員。這種自欺欺人的製造難民的方策。無論如何希望能改進。退一步講卽令因萬不得已的原因。而必須裁員。那也應該裁高額收入者。這樣。雖然使一個人失業而成爲難民。但却已使數個或數十個少額收入者不成爲難民了。而且在事實上。高額收入者因爲平常收入豐富。較有積蓄所以卽令被裁。容或也還不致流爲難民哩。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云。當日機轟炸南車站時未見該處有一兵士。前日又在松江轟炸由滬開出之難民火車。死傷七八百人。其野蠻擧動。實如森林之惡魔。自二次滬戰開始。敵人慘殺我無辜民衆。莫可勝數。卽令第三者見之。尚不禁爲之義憤填胸。大聲痛斥。而我國人身。歷其境者。更當如何認識此猙獰恐怖之兇惡面貌。而永永深刻於腦筋中也。</p>
<p>據保定息。僞滿軍三師。受敵命令由熱開罕。行抵赤城突然宣布反正此固可能而亦必然之事也。蓋我國軍隊所以貿然從逆者無非爲敵方利誘威脅故一時良知良能。爲之汨沒。今見我國忠勇將士。浴血奮鬥。前仆後繼。則此一點未靈之天良。必要之打擊。宜如死灰之復燃矣。</p>

<h3>寫給關心救護工作的朋友們（下）</h3>
<p>— 江曉鳴</p>
<p>現在，我們迫切需要的工作，便是要建立起一座軍民交流的橋樑，意思就是說，我們淞滬沿線的救護工作，不能僅恃着上海方面民衆所辦的傷兵醫院就能夠盡量地收容，我們需要軍醫當局也要負起收容傷兵的責任。在事實上，民衆確已担任起救護的職責，而軍醫當局也曾已担任救護的職責，并且關于軍醫醫院和衛生兵站的分佈，早已有了極周詳配備，那末，我們要適應持久抗戰的準備，祇要做到能够盡量疏通上海方面的傷兵，更能完成我們最大的任務，便能保持上海傷兵醫院可以源源收容傷兵，不感恐慌。如今，這軍民交流的橋樑，差幸已經建起了，那末，有許多人躁急地焦慮到上海方面傷兵醫院，將不够收容，那是把上海租界過份的看作安全的後方，而忽略到軍備當局的能力和安全的配備，更不知內地正有許多民衆所辦的傷兵醫院的力量。雖然我們還希望上海方面有大量的傷兵醫院出現，但我們所應有的民軍交流的橋樑，不容我們不豐起，不容我們不顧慮未來的持久抗戰的局面，而虔誠的希望焦躁的朋友們多盡些財力和人力，多設法創辦幾座大規模的傷兵醫院。</p>
<p>我以爲傷兵的待遇，不可過豐，也不可以過薄，譬如說一個傷兵已經受了重傷，任憑你供給他珍饈美味，他也是無法享受，若是他們剛從難苦危險的環境中，忽而養尊處優起來，這一心理的改變，很可以引起人們貪逸茍安的惰性，見于一朝，這于抗戰前途祇有害而無益，最理想的希望，我們祇要能給他們些適口的菜飯，和比較能够滋養的食品，也就很可以了，我想有多餘消耗的錢，不如多擴充病床的單位，多收容些受傷的人，反而要實惠多。至于眞僞虐待傷兵的人，不僅應受良心的譴責，應該受四萬萬同胞共棄譴，我們祈禱中國不再看見這樣等于漢奸式的人。</p>
<p>關于慰勞的事，當然需要集中分配，我很希望慰勞也要有一個專門的組織，不然，集中在紅十字會或地方協會去分配，那也是一個辦法，有許多人以爲親自到傷兵的床前去慰勞，多分自己安慰，傷兵也安慰，其實，多與傷兵交談，多耗去傷兵的精神，多供給傷兵慰勞的食品，多引起傷兵的腸胃疾病，甚而，奸宄借着慰勞去刺探軍情，無恥的人們見着慰勞有利可圖，也想鑚營主辦傷兵醫院，借着幌子來吸收慰勞物品去飽私囊，流弊之多，不遑枚舉，倘使慰勞品有一個機關，能够集中分配，第一在物質上全上海的傷兵可以平均享受，第二在精神上，可訓練些專門慰勞服務人才，在規定時間內，能够給傷兵以最需要的慰籍，和相當的敎育，並替他們實地去服務。像眼前童子重服務的精神，方法，和紀律，便是一個很好的榜樣。</p>
<p>今日救護的事業，做到怎麼樣一種程度？我當然不能貿然置答，正如某先生的妙喻，辦總比不辦的好，如歷來主辦婚喪喜愛的人家，豈能盡如人意的，結果是一樣的。我們很願意多方面無取安靜的方法去努力改進，　　　　着空想，不顧事實，　　　　，不想步驟，只吹毛求痕，不探不求原，便能改進救護工作的。更不容未親歷其境，未細加考量，就輕加批評輕詬人非的，像某女醫師荒乎其唐的曾說過，沒有用輸血療法，便連什麼療法都是十八世紀中療法，這嚴重的錯誤，便知道有許多偶然事件太易受感情衝動，而不暇擇詞，豈知醫師說的內行話，那信口雌簧，影響到社會不知醫學的人士憤愕，則何其大焉！</p>
<p>最後，我誠懇的希望社會人士，予救護工作以熱烈的提携，我們不能把救護的水準估得過高，也不能估得過低，主持和辦理救護工作的人，也不能笑罵由他，好壞我自，更不容獨專善自己，我們要在　節物力準備持久，勿爭奪鬬畏，和救護傷兵醫治傷兵應一併重視的兩個原則上，如何善待傷兵，如何疏運傷兵，如何教育傷兵，如何尊重統一地的驟，如何尊重中心救護機關的議决事件，如何集中才力物力，如何做到軍民交流，如何使戰場傷兵獲救，如何使治愈傷兵加增殺敵的雄心，這才是改進救護的方針，也是爭取中華民族全面抗戰中一部分的勝利。</p>
<h3>京市府實施城區編組聯保</h3>

<p>京市府又以此次對日抗戰、實爲我中華民族生死存亡之最後關頭、凡我同胞、稍具血性者、莫不抱定誓與敵人周旋之决心、無論前方將士、後方民衆、雖任務各有不同、其冒萬死以謀復興我民族鞏固我國家者初無二致、乃近來各地發現少數喪心病狂之徒、受敵一時之微利、置我整個民族于不顧、而甘爲漢奸、其罪固不容誅、其愚亦復可憫、特不惜作最後勸告、望速猛醒、略謂、㊀有因失業不得已而爲漢奸者，殊不知失業係個人一時之否塞、茍非殘敗、斷無終身失業之理、最近政府正在救濟失業之人、倘失業者申請情由、請求救濟、政府當妥爲設法、何苦貪一時之小利、爲虎作倀、貽子孫萬世無窮之羞、㊁人民䚰庇國家、旣有共存共榮之幸福自應竭盡忠誠、極力愛戴、倘味於大義、惑於小利、甘爲漢奸、試問國破家亡、祖宗墓蘆、皆不可保、尙何顏立於人世乎、㊂敵機夜襲、往往利用漢奸發佈信號、此事尤爲慘酷、良以炸彈下轟擊、迫不及避、則漢奸本身、立有粉身碎骨之處、㊃作姦犯科、法所不容、然揆之人情、或有略其跡而原其心者、惟甘作漢奸、則國人皆曰可殺、祖宗三代、均唾罵千秋、萬世汚名莫洗、可恥孰甚、以上四点、理極顯明、保去何從雖至愚亦不難立辦、如有無恥之徒、誤入迷途、經此次勸告能翩然悔悟者、政府寬大爲懷、當可不咎旣往、予以自新、倘仍不聽勸告、是則冥頑不靈、自絕于國人、國法具在、必殺無赦、</p>

<h3>Enemy Claims General Offensive Today; We Have Long Been Resolved, Awaiting in Strict Formation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Fierce Battle on Military Industry Road Resulted in Death of Enemy Regiment Commander.</p>
<p>At Luodian, We Pursued the Victory; Enemy Position Increasingly Compressed.</p>
<p>Our Air Force Attacked Enemy Ships at Night, Enemy Aircraft Suffered Heavy Damage.</p>
<p>According to midnight reports, ㊀ the enemy's second reinforcement unit has completely landed, joining the front line to fight. Days of intense attacks from all directions have been met with fierce resistance, and they have not succeeded. It is reported that the enemy has declared that they will launch a general offensive today. However, the enemy's strategy has long been detected by our army, and our army's position is solid and our forces are strong. If the enemy attacks, they will suffer heavy losses. ㊁ The intensity of the fierce battle at the Qiujiang Wharf yesterday morning was rare since the start of the Shanghai battle. Approximately one thousand enemy soldiers advanced towards our military industry road position. After being fiercely attacked head-on by our army, the enemy suffered three to four hundred casualties. Regiment Commander Iida Shichiro, Company Commander Umeda Sadao, and Squad Leader Kato were all killed on the spot by our army. Afterwards, the enemy continued to attack, and the battle continued all day. However, our military industry road line remained unshaken. ㊂ When Baoshan City fell, all the soldiers in the battalion led by our General Yao Ziqing heroically sacrificed themselves. The morale of the front-line soldiers has become even more激昂. Currently, our army is holding the line east of Yanghang, blocking the enemy's advance and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. ㊃ In the Luodian area, after our army captured Changqiao, the enemy's position became increasingly compressed, and the enemy in the Shizilin area was also under great threat. Our army is currently advancing victoriously. ㊄ In the Yunzaobang area, the enemy and us are still facing each other on both sides of the Nansitang River. The enemy at Yunzaobang previously attempted to cross the Nansitang River to attack, and many were killed by us. Examining the symbols, it is known that the enemy there is the 6th Regiment of the Nagoya 3rd Division. ㊅ In the Zhabei area, yesterday morning was particularly quiet. From noon until evening, the enemy attacked several times, but were bravely repelled by our army, and the front line remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th Military News, ㊀ The enemy's invading forces in Shanghai total six divisions. Those that have already participated in the battle are the 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 19th Divisions. The other two divisions that have been added have also arrived in Shanghai. ㊁ On the 8th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our Guanyintang Road area along both sides of the military industry road from Shanghai Jiang University, but was repelled by our army. The enemy's advance at Qiujiang Wharf was also repelled by us. ㊂ The battalion that was completely martyred in Baoshan City on the 6th was Yao Ziqing's battalion of a certain regiment of the 98th Division. ㊃ The enemy that attacked from the Nansitang River on the 7th was the 6th Regiment of the Nagoya 3rd Division. It is estimated that we killed eight or nine hundred people and captured more than twenty rifles and one mortar. ㊄ The enemy at Wusong used heavy artillery and tanks to attack our position on the morning of the 8th. The position in front of Jinjiazai was broken through. Our army is now bravely counterattacking at the Xiaoguzhai position. By the morning of the 9th, the entire Jinjiazai position had been recaptured. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. ㊈ More than twenty enemy ships near the Shalonggang port fired on our Yuepu position all night from the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, it became even more intense, followed by eight tanks covering the advance from Baoshan to Yuepu along both sides of the highway. The fighting between the two sides was fierce, and they are still confronting each other. ㊆ There were no changes in Luodian.</p>
<h3>Enemy Counterattacked Along Military Industry Road; Routed by Our Ambush, Retreating to the Riverbank</h3>
<p>At 5:00 AM yesterday, enemy ships in the Huangpu River again frequently attacked our downtown area positions. At the same time, a small group of enemy soldiers, numbering about four to five hundred, used five tanks to advance towards our army from Guanyintang and other places on the military industry road. At 7:00 AM, the enemy's outpost arrived near Chunjiang Road, behind Lujia Guanyintang. Our defending troops of the □ brigade calmly responded, and when they approached, they rushed out of Yangjiazai and launched a fierce attack on the enemy. Under the strafing of our machine guns and the attacks of hand grenades and mortars, the stubborn enemy suffered heavy casualties, with few survivors.</p>
<p>According to a report from a certain military vehicle unit, at 5:00 AM yesterday, enemy ships and aircraft in the Huangpu River launched a large-scale bombing of our military industry road, Wuquan Road, and Guanyinqiao area positions. At the same time, a large group of infantry attacked the Fengjiazhai intersection. After a while, another group of enemy soldiers advanced towards Zhangjiazhai. At that time, our army at Shenjiaxingzhen immediately moved out, divided into groups, and launched a fierce attack on the left side and back of the enemy. There was no turning back. The enemy responded in a panic, and the front line immediately wavered. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the enemy collapsed, retreating to the riverbank. Also, in the Guanyinqiao area, our army and the enemy are still confronting each other across the Qiujiang River.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at about 5:00 AM yesterday, enemy ships on the Qiujiang Wharf river surface opened fire and bombarded our military industry road, Wuquan Road, and Guanyintang Road areas. Enemy aircraft also flew in formation over the sky to bomb. At the same time, the enemy at Qiujiang Wharf, under the cover of enemy aircraft and artillery fire, attacked our Fengjiazhai intersection. Our army lured the enemy deep and retreated. The enemy followed, reaching the vicinity of Zhangjiazhai. Our troops stationed in Shenjiaxing launched a surprise attack from the northeast on the left and back of the enemy. The enemy was caught in an ambush by our army and suffered heavy losses. They then retreated to the riverbank in a panic and did not dare to attack until evening. As for Guanyinqiao, the enemy and us are still confronting each other across the Qiujiang River.</p>
<p>The result of the fierce battle in the Yinxiangxiang area on the 8th was that, in addition to Hecunzhai, which had already been captured by our army, the enemy troops in Zhoujiazhai had been completely cleared, and only a few remnants remained in the Shenjiazhai area. It is said that on that day, our army killed a total of eight or nine hundred enemies in that area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacked Zhabei Again, But Did Not Succeed</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 PM yesterday, fierce fighting broke out again between the enemy and us in the Baoshan Road area. The enemy launched an attack on our position from several routes, including Dongbaoxing Road and Yingui Road. When we saw the enemy approaching, we immediately used mortars and machine guns to counterattack, preventing the enemy from advancing, and confronted the enemy remotely relying on the built fortifications. At about 3:00 PM, the gunfire subsided, but the enemy frequently bombarded indiscriminately with artillery until late in the evening.</p>
<p>In the Qingyun Road Baziqiao area of Zhabei, fierce fighting broke out again between the enemy and our army between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM yesterday. For a time, the sound of machine guns and artillery was as dense as a string of beads. The nearby civilian houses in that area were hit by enemy artillery fire and burned fiercely.</p>
<h3>Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses at Yunzaobang</h3>
<p>The battle at Yunzaobang last night was extremely fierce. Our right-wing □ division has advanced to the vicinity of Caojiazhai in Yunzaobang, and a very fierce bloody battle has taken place in that area. Although the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our army fiercely, our army's position was not damaged at all. The artillery battle near Wangjiazhuang was also very fierce.</p>
<p>Enemy ships at Songkou bombarded Caojiazhai, north of Yunzaobang, on the 8th, and we also used heavy artillery to bombard the enemy's position in the Wangjiazhuang area, causing heavy losses to the enemy.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Luodian; Our Army Recaptured Changqiao and Other Places</h3>
<p>Our army in Luodian attacked Changqiao, about two kilometers north of the town, the day before yesterday (the 8th), and fought fiercely with more than a thousand enemy soldiers in the area west of Wujiazhai, Tanshichqiao, and Xiaojintangzhai. Our army first used rifles and machine guns to shoot, then used hand grenades to attack the enemy fiercely, and finally launched a bayonet charge for close combat. In the evening, Changqiao was recaptured. At the same time, a part of our soldiers crossed the Shanghai-Taicang Road in the dark and recovered Fengjiazhai, about one kilometer north of Changqiao. As a result of this bloody battle all day, our army, with its brave charge and being attacked from three sides, had one company commander, two platoon leaders, and more than one hundred and sixty soldiers heroically sacrifice themselves. However, the enemy's corpses were also scattered all over the ground, and the number of casualties was several times that of our army.</p>
<p>According to refugees who escaped from the countryside of Jiading, they escaped from Gujiazhen, Luodian, along the Shanghai-Taicang Road. There were no Japanese soldiers along the way, and all the guarding soldiers were Chinese troops. Japanese soldiers have now retreated to the seaside about six li northeast of Luodian Town. However, since the war broke out there, many soldiers and civilians have been killed and injured. The fields smell bad, and there are corpses everywhere, and most of them are abandoned in the river. Therefore, the water in the river is undrinkable. The flower fields have all borne fruit, but no one is harvesting them. Abandoning wealth on the ground is really a pity.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Telegram, Military News, ㊀ About one brigade of the enemy at Zhanghuabang, at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 7th, divided into eight groups, each group with about one company of infantry, crossed the North Sitang River using rubber boats and other means, and attacked our position. Our army bravely counterattacked, and after a day of fierce fighting, completely repelled the enemy who crossed the river. In this battle, the enemy suffered about nearly a thousand casualties.</p>
<h3>We Repelled Enemy Armored Vehicle Convoy</h3>
<p>The enemy in the Baoshan Yuepu Town area used eight armored vehicles to attack our position on the 8th. They were densely bombarded by our army with mortars. The enemy vehicles were severely damaged and were repelled.</p>
<p>On the 8th, eight enemy armored vehicles appeared in the Baoshan County to Yuepu Town area. Later, they repeatedly attacked our position with infantry. We densely bombarded them with mortars, and the enemy vehicles were damaged considerably and collapsed one after another, and finally failed.</p>
<h3>We Repelled Landing Enemy Troops in Pudong</h3>
<p>Confirmed news: At about 11:00 AM yesterday, a small unit of enemy troops, under the cover of enemy ships in the Huangpu River, secretly landed at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong. Our defending troops waited until they landed and gained a foothold before strafing them with dense machine guns. After a little resistance, the enemy fled back in a panic. In this battle, six enemy soldiers were killed by us, and only one of our soldiers died. (Another report) At 0:15 PM yesterday, another speedboat carrying seven Japanese soldiers sailed directly towards the Lujiazui Chunjiang Wharf. When it was only four feet away from the shore, our sentries immediately fired machine guns, and the boat quickly sped away. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, four enemy aircraft flew to the sky above Pudong and circled, dropping several bombs in the Changchangzhan area before leaving.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Assist in the Battle</h3>
<p>Our Air Force came to Shanghai to assist in the battle at about 5:00 PM yesterday. When passing over the Huangpu River from west to east, enemy ships fired high-射砲guns and machine guns indiscriminately. At that time, stray bullets and iron shrapnel fell in the central area of the concession, but fortunately they were not in the bustling city, so no major disasters occurred. According to a reporter's investigation, two Westerners were injured in front of the Citibank building on Fuzhou Road, and three people, including a shoemaker and a newspaper editor, were injured in front of the Zhongnan Bank on Hankou Road. The police station ambulance immediately dispatched and sent the injured to the hospital for emergency treatment.</p>
<p>Our Air Force came to Shanghai twice last night and this morning and engaged in fierce battles with enemy ships over the Huangpu River. The first time was at about 11:30 PM, when we suddenly heard the sound of high-射砲guns booming incessantly. We knew our planes were coming to attack, but it was quiet after about five minutes. An hour later, the sound of artillery fire rose again, like a string of beads, and signal flares and searchlights were fired at the same time, shining like lightning. Our planes also returned fire with machine guns, and the sound of格格 was heard in the clouds. The battle situation was very fierce. Our planes circled several times and then flew away safely. They did not drop any bombs. At that time, there was a rumbling sound, which was the heavy artillery fired by our army, using the signals sent by the enemy ships as targets to aim and bombard. It is said that the enemy ships were ambushed by us and suffered considerable damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy Mechanized Units Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to confirmed reports, more than twenty enemy aircraft near Shalonggang bombarded our position fiercely last night, and more than 4,000 enemy troops landed at the Huishan Wharf, most of whom were mechanized units.</p>
<p>The enemy has been fighting hard in Shanghai for nearly a month, but has made no progress. They have repeatedly requested assistance from the country, and it has arrived one after another. According to confirmed news, on the morning of the 8th, another four transport ships sailed into the Huangpu River and landed at the Huangpu and Osaka wharves. It is said that most of this batch is mechanized units, numbering about 4,500 people, all carrying new weapons. It is expected that they will intensify their brutal killing methods in the coming days in an attempt to make a final effort.</p>
<h3>Mei Foo Oil Depot Hit by a Shell and Caught Fire</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, enemy ships in the Huangpu River suddenly bombarded our Pudong area position with artillery yesterday evening. Several shells fell on the Mei Foo Oil Depot behind Qichangzhan, which immediately caught fire. The fire was still spreading late into the night. The enemy's indiscriminate shelling is causing significant damage to the enterprises of various countries in Shanghai every time. It is said that entrepreneurs from various countries have requested their governments to file representations.</p>
<h3>Huacheng Tobacco Company Burned Down</h3>
<p>The enemy's atrocities in the Yangshupu and Hongkou areas are endless. It is learned that the Huacheng Tobacco Company on Peikai'er Road was set on fire by the enemy at 3:00 PM on the morning before last. The goods stored in the China Merchants Bureau's Central and Northern Warehouses were all搬运一空 by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Attacked Enemy Ships at Night; One Heavily Damaged</h3>
<p>Enemy-Occupied Golf Course Used to Park Aircraft Was Bombed by Us, Destroying More Than Ten Aircraft</p>
<p>At 7:05 PM the night before last (the 8th), two of our aircraft flew to the Huangpu River to carry out bombing. One shell hit the Minghua Sugar Factory and exploded immediately. Details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It was found that the factory stored a lot of enemy military supplies and was stationed by troops. According to yesterday's investigation, a large enemy ship in the Huangpu River was also hit and heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Confirmed news: A team of our aircraft bombed enemy ships in the Huangpu River several times the night before last and yesterday morning. At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, our aircraft flew to the enemy airfield in Yangshupu again and launched a直炸, dropping four shells. In the midst of a rumbling sound, black smoke rose. More than ten enemy aircraft parked in the airfield were destroyed. After the enemy was awakened, they fired high-射砲guns wildly. Our aircraft had safely and successfully flown back.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it is confirmed that our air force appeared several times in the Huangpu River at about 0:00 AM yesterday and bombed the enemy. They dropped four shells in the enemy's temporary airfield built near Shanghai Jiang University at the end of Yangshupu Road, which immediately caught fire, destroying more than ten enemy aircraft. According to the Central News Agency, a team of our aircraft flew over the Huangpu River three times the night before last and yesterday morning, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and launching a fierce直炸. Several shells exploded immediately, and the sound shook the city, clearly hitting its target. According to confirmed news, a large enemy ship in the Huangpu River has been heavily damaged, which was caused by our army's bombing.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Japanese army has now resumed the actions of the January 28th Incident, turning the golf course near Shanghai Jiang University into an aircraft landing site, which is said to be used for the army aircraft operating in the Shanghai area. Another airfield is being built on Chongming Island. According to reliable sources, about twelve aircraft of various types were parked at the golf course yesterday, and several more were being unloaded from ships in Yangshupu.</p>
<p>It has recently been learned from reliable sources that the enemy has converted the original golf course between the Gongda Yarn Factory and the Military Industry Road in Yangshupu into a temporary airfield, which has been completed. Several land aircraft have been parked there since the day before yesterday, waiting for orders from the enemy's land army to take off and fight. It is also learned that the 3rd Air Regiment under the command of the enemy's 16th Division, which has recently been增援 from Japan, has arrived in Shanghai in large numbers and is using this temporary airfield as an aviation base in Yangshupu. The large bombers that hovered over the Nanshi Zhabei Qiujiang Wharf yesterday took off from there.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Tragically Bombed Songjiang Station; Road Bureau Repaired and Opened to Traffic</h3>
<p>Opening-Beijing and Opening-Hangzhou Passenger Trains Changed to Evening Departures; One Enemy Aircraft Flew Over Ping Station Yesterday for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft bombed five passenger cars from Shanghai to Hangzhou at Songjiang Station the day before yesterday, causing more than 700 innocent refugees to be killed or injured. This is an unprecedented catastrophe for our transportation sector. The暴敌's wanton killing of non-combatants is not tolerated by any citizen with even a little humanity. At that time, the Songjiang Station was also severely damaged. After receiving the news, the two Road Administration Bureaus immediately dispatched engineering vehicles and ambulances, risking danger, to rush to the scene, first rescuing the injured refugees to nearby hospitals for treatment, then clearing the tracks, and rushing to repair. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the repairs were completed and traffic was opened. For the safety of passengers, the bureau changed to using two passenger cars from yesterday, because there is a danger of air raids during the day, so it was changed to running at night. It departs for Hangzhou at 6:30 PM and for Beijing at 7:00 PM every day, and passengers still board at the West Station. It is also learned that at 10:20 AM yesterday morning, a team of enemy aircraft flew over the Linping Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road for reconnaissance, but did not drop any bombs. After about two minutes, they went east. At that time, Hangzhou City had issued an air raid alert and was strictly guarded. Because the enemy aircraft had turned back, the alert was lifted.</p>
<p>According to passengers, it is very difficult to buy tickets at the West Station. Some people have waited for two hours and have not been able to buy a ticket and board the train. It is hoped that the Road Bureau will find a way to improve it.</p>
<h3>How Can the World Tolerate the Savage Acts of Enemy Aircraft?</h3>
<p>Japan's International Status Is Becoming More and More Isolated, Stained by the Blood of Innocent Civilians</p>
<p>According to the English "Da Mei Ying Bao", when the aircraft bombed the South Railway Station that day, independent observers did not see a single soldier there, only hundreds of pitiful refugees, who were killed or injured among their scattered piles of luggage. We have called it murder. The Japanese aircraft bombed the refugee train from Shanghai at Songjiang the day before yesterday. It is reported that 300 people were killed and 400 people were injured. There is not a single word in English to describe this kind of action. Its barbarity is unheard of. There is no military purpose. It is伤天害理 beyond measure. The whole world must be silently shocked by it, because there is really nothing to say, only shock and pain. Will the perpetrators try to justify their actions? But the facts are clear and cannot mitigate this crime against God. There was no military train in between, and there is no reason to suspect this. In any case, those who drive military aircraft and use their tragic weapons to harm civilians cannot escape their responsibility. Since the British ambassador was injured, this lesson cannot be evaded. Even if China had declared war, it could be said. Now, the two sides have not declared war, have not declared the purpose of the war, and have not given helpless non-combatants the opportunity to avoid to areas that can be considered safe. This kind of crime is unforgivable. In short, there is no place that can be considered safe today. The fact that the two sides have not officially engaged in actual combat may be a good thing, but now they are wantonly屠殺 the innocent, causing civilians to be killed and injured. This is unprecedented in wartime. Although the total number of war deaths and injuries in the past was more than it is today, they were all soldiers, or soldiers made up the majority. I never expected that in the 1937 war in China, Chinese men, women, and children would suffer such a tragic disaster. Judging from the current situation, if the whole world can know about the tragedy caused by the bombing of refugee trains, it seems that it can promote a firm action from the outside world. This kind of behavior that violates the rules of war, this kind of evil魔降臨 that is even more inferior than the morality of the forest, cannot be tolerated on human conscience. What I am afraid of now is that people around the world will not be able to believe what happened here, at least temporarily, and will feel that this is another accidental event. But is this an accidental event? This is a manifestation of a cold determination to break China's determination to resist by relying on any unbelievable means. What can strengthen China's will to resist more than this? We are in this war and always treat both sides in a fair manner. This is our policy. We are often criticized by both sides for being too lenient towards the other. But the bombing of the South Railway Station is something that we cannot forgive, and the bombing of refugee trains seems even more brutal to us. We can't even listen to their defense, because the facts are clear and there is no room for further debate. Japan is now被全世界所唾罵, and even those who love it cannot defend it this time. Japan is now isolated and stained by the blood of innocent civilians.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Fall of Baoshan on the 7th; One Battalion of Our Army Martyred</h3>
<p>Only Two or Three Survivors; Enemy Casualties Also Extremely Heavy</p>
<p>Since the 5th, the enemy has concentrated the power of its navy, army, and air force to attack Baoshan County. The one battalion of our troops stationed in the city were determined to die with the city and fought loyally. After two days of fighting, they lost contact with the outside and were cut off from reinforcements. Finally, the enemy's reinforcements continued to arrive, broke into the city. Our defending soldiers, from the battalion commander on down, were all martyred, and died with the city on the 7th. However, the intensity of our army's resistance and the tragedy of their sacrifice were the greatest scene since the start of the Shanghai battle, and also the most glorious page in the history of our nation's liberation war. According to a report from a soldier who was wounded and returned from the city, the battle went through the following: Baoshan City is located on the coast, and it is very difficult to defend. However, in order to connect its coastal positions, the enemy must do everything possible to fight for it. Since the 5th, the enemy has concentrated 30 warships, lined up at the Songkou, and bombarded fiercely with排砲. It also used more than 20 tanks to cover the infantry charge. Our defending soldiers, one battalion in total, defended the city and frequently used machine guns and手溜彈 to counterattack intensively. The enemy advanced and retreated repeatedly and suffered heavy losses. The enemy then launched a fierce attack from several routes, and the positions outside the city were lost, resulting in being surrounded. All the soldiers of our battalion pledged their lives to the country. Even in the besieged city, they still responded calmly. At that time, the city wall was broken in many places by enemy artillery fire. We filled and defended it at any time, but it was too late. Enemy soldiers took advantage of the opportunity to arrive, but our army never showed weakness, aimed and shot, and often repelled the enemy. With a small place and the strength of one battalion, they held on for two days and nights. Finally, due to the continuous increase of the enemy and the disparity in the number of enemy and us, they were rushed in by the enemy and a street battle broke out. On the 7th, our ammunition was exhausted and we were exhausted, so it fell. Our entire battalion was sacrificed, and only two or three were wounded and escaped, while the enemy's casualties were also extremely heavy. The fierceness of our soldiers' resistance in this battle was enough to terrify the enemy.</p>

<h3>Measures for the Placement of Peiping-Tianjin Refugee Students in the Capital</h3>
<p>Over Three Hundred People Reside in the Second Middle School. Methods Are Established for Middle School Students to Enter Schools.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The over three hundred Peiping-Tianjin refugee students who have come to the capital are concentrated in the Second Middle School, where they receive two meals a day, temporarily provided by the Ministry of Education.

<h3>European and American Mail Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time After the Shanghai War</h3>

The post office has taken steps to hand it over to the Nagasaki Maru of the Japanese Mail Ship Company a few days ago to transport a batch to Shanghai. The ship arrived at the port at about 3:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Yangshupu Wharf. Since the military eastern area prohibits people from coming and going, the post office consulted with the authorities of the Public Concession to find a way to transport it out. There is still mail stranded in Japan, which will continue to be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to sources from the city's transportation agencies, the submarine cablegrams from Shanghai to Shantou and Xiamen have been destroyed since the enemy illegally blockaded the sea, so it is impossible to report.

<h3>League of Nations Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Plans to Apply for Discussion of the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>[Geneva] League of Nations officials recently announced that Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow afternoon to attend the League of Nations Assembly and the Executive Council meeting. He will submit an appeal to the League of Nations regarding the war between China and Japan. Regarding this matter, Dr. Hu Shize, the director of the Chinese office in the League of Nations, that is, the minister to Switzerland, had already received instructions and has not yet officially notified the League of Nations. The Chinese government had submitted a note to the League of Nations on the 30th of last month regarding the war between China and Japan, accusing Japan of violating the League of Nations Covenant and other existing treaties, but did not make any conclusions. Generally, until the last few days, in order to fulfill its obligations as a member state and obtain moral support, it was decided to formally file an appeal. According to Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant, "Any circumstance affecting international relations, which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends, any member State has the right, in a friendly manner, to bring it to the attention of the Assembly or the Executive Council. As to whether China will submit the appeal to the Executive Council or the League of Nations Assembly, it is not yet known. What is known is that the country will not take any action before the 13th of this month, that is, the opening of the League of Nations Assembly. Although the Executive Council is scheduled to meet first on the 10th, the first few days of the meeting will be devoted to discussing the Mediterranean issue, and there will be no time to take into account anything else. In addition, the League of Nations will not decide to impose sanctions on Japan after China submits its appeal. Chinese people here firmly believe that the League of Nations will recognize Japan as an aggressor at that time, so some countries will not be able to declare neutrality and prohibit the sale of military goods to China. (Central News Agency, Havana, August 8)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, which is rumored to be aimed at communizing China, the country's delegation to the League of Nations recently issued a statement solemnly denying it and recalled the text of Article 3 of the treaty, which states, "The provisions of this treaty shall not be interpreted as affecting or modifying the rights and obligations of the two Contracting Parties arising under any bilateral or multilateral treaties already concluded by the two Contracting Parties before the entry into force of this treaty." It stated that according to Article 6 of the Sino-Soviet Outline Agreement on the Settlement of Outstanding Issues of 1924, the two contracting parties agreed that they would not tolerate any organization that conspired to overthrow the other party's government and would not adopt propaganda movements that were inconsistent with the other party's political and social organization. This obligation does not change due to the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. (Central Daily, Havana, August 8)</p>

<h3>The United States Still Focuses on Maintaining Treaties in the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Does Not Evade Responsibility for the Nine-Power Treaty, Withdrawal of Overseas Chinese is to Cope With Peace Groups</p>
<p>[Washington] US officials today are unwilling to publicly express their opinions on the so-called US prestige in the Far East by the US overseas Chinese in Shanghai, but they unanimously believe that the US government's decision to keep warships stationed in China and to take firm diplomatic action at any time are all sufficient to safeguard the US interests and principles and treaty rights. On the contrary, a large number of US overseas Chinese residing in China are not sufficient to safeguard the prestige of the United States, but are enough to cause danger, causing the US government to face disputes and not be able to act freely. If an incident occurs without the withdrawal of overseas Chinese, domestic public opinion will inevitably demand that the President implement the Neutrality Act, which will have a greater impact on the prestige and power of the United States in the Far East than the withdrawal of overseas Chinese. If the US government is mired in such a situation, it will be tantamount to evading the responsibility for guaranteeing China's sovereignty stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty, which was initiated by the United States. Moreover, even without an incident, those at home who demand the implementation of the Neutrality Act have made it difficult for the government to deal with. If there are further American casualties, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull will not be able to continue to refuse this demand. The American overseas Chinese in Shanghai do not understand the strong domestic political demands for neutrality and avoiding war, and President Roosevelt's remarks on Block Island last Sunday were intended to respond to these demands. However, its true meaning is no different from Secretary of State Hull's repeated declarations, but the tone is stronger, so as to reassure domestic peace groups, newspaper commentators, and anti-government factions. The president's words have now taken effect at home. For example, six peace groups have written to the president today, saying, "Foreign American overseas Chinese call your withdrawal of overseas Chinese a cowardly move, but we call it common sense. It is not cowardly to protect the interests of the whole country instead of focusing on the interests of a few people." (National Electric, August 8)</p>
<p>[Washington] US Secretary of Commerce Roper declared today that the war or the threat of war has not, so far, hindered the US domestic and foreign industry and commerce. The American people are united in demanding and determined to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, but the world situation also makes the US government deeply concerned. US shipping is harmed not only in the Far East but also in the Mediterranean. Secretary of State Hull discussed ways to deal with this with Maritime Commission Director Kennedy today. According to Hull, no special measures have yet been taken to protect US commercial points, nor has a plan to increase warships been decided. (National Electric, August 8)</p>
<p>[Washington] Six national peace groups jointly telegraphed President Roosevelt, asking him to quickly implement the Neutrality Act for the Sino-Japanese War and withdraw the army and navy stationed in China to prevent "another Lusitania or Maine from being sunk by someone, resulting in irreparable war."

<p>[New York] Retired US Major General Sterling published an article in the New York Sun today, titled "Is Intervention Against Japan Possible?" He first compared the naval strengths of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, then asserted that Japan dared to act so recklessly in China because it knew the possibility of European countries uniting against Japan was slim. Therefore, Japan's current dominance in East Asia stems from the inability of European and American countries to determine their policy in the Far East and to back it with their navies. He stated that an understanding between European and American countries is not impossible. If it becomes a reality and their combined fleet forces Japan to cease its acts of aggression in China, Japan will either face self-destruction or surrender. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Public Opinion Newspaper commented today on Japan's reply to Britain, stating that based on the content of this reply, Japan clearly anticipates that Britain, given the current European situation, will not take severe measures against Japan. When Japan launched its aggression against China, Britain was mired in an extreme economic panic, to the point of abandoning its gold standard. When Japan carried out the second phase of its aggression against China, Britain was entangled in Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. Now, it is bound by the Spanish Civil War and the conflicting relations between Italy and Germany, and Soviet Russia, caused by this war. Every time Japan intensifies its atrocities in China, Britain invariably faces unexpected constraints that tie its hands, which is indeed unfortunate. Therefore, Japan can now afford to ignore Britain's note and demands regarding the injury of Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, just as it did to Secretary of State Stimson's note in 1931.

<h3>British Cabinet Holds Two Meetings</h3>
<p>Discussing the International Situation</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet met twice today to discuss the international situation. While the Far East incident is equally serious, cabinet members are more concerned about developments closer to Britain. The British government hopes that Japan's final reply regarding the Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen injury case will not be delayed too long and that it will be of a nature that is more satisfactory to the British government. The two cabinet meetings lasted a total of three and a half hours, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet held a regular meeting this afternoon to discuss the Far East situation. They studied the "temporary" reply submitted by Japan regarding the attack on the British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. It is reported that the meeting decided to wait for several days for Japan to submit a formal reply. Whether Britain will take various measures, such as recalling its ambassador to Japan, will be decided after reviewing the reply. In addition, the Cabinet also discussed the Mediterranean issue and reportedly decided that the Mediterranean conference should still be held as scheduled, regardless of whether Italy and Germany participate. If those countries refuse to participate, the originally planned location, Nyon, will be changed to Geneva. Furthermore, the original plan to set boundaries within which submarines of the countries involved can navigate along their coasts, without being allowed to cross them, will also be cancelled to avoid a permanent state of hostility in the Mediterranean. Instead, warships of the countries involved will escort merchant ships on the main shipping lanes in the Mediterranean. However, this method may be opposed by France, so changes may occur after Foreign Secretary Eden meets with French Foreign Minister Delbos in Paris tomorrow. Finally, the Cabinet also discussed the Abyssinian issue and decided that the British delegation would not initiate anything in Geneva. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Luo Jialun Writes Artillery Song</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Luo Jialun, the president of Central University, praised the power of our artillery in this battle as a roar of our nation. He specifically wrote the "Artillery Song" and is soliciting musical scores for it so that it can be sent to the army and the people for application. The lyrics are: "The artillery sounds like spring thunder, the mountains crumble and the seas rise as the motherland struggles to be heroic. Destroy the enemy's阵, cover the charge, bang, bang to open the national crisis, artillery shells are the vanguard. Every shot hits the mark, the enemy retreats like a tide, the golden cup is re-established, the land of Yu vibrates with heroic wind, the nation's military strength is equally promoted, artillery, artillery, artillery builds wonders with one exit."

<h3>German Social Democratic Party's Public Works</h3>
<p>People's Welfare Association Report</p>
<p>⊙Nuremberg The Minister of the People's Welfare Department of the National Socialist Party, Hilgenfeldt, today reported on the work of the People's Welfare Association with precise statistics. It is said that ㊀ the winter relief movement has increased year by year, raising a total of 422,000,000 marks last year, compared to only 357,000,000 marks in 1935. ㊁ Regarding the food problem, there are 100,000 pigs this year, raised with food collected from kitchen waste. After two years of feeding, this waste can be used to raise 1 million pigs, which can generate 150,000,000 marks worth of feed from kitchen garbage each year. ㊂ Regarding the work of women and children, since the establishment of the Women and Children's Association, a total of 8,500,000 mothers have received help, and the infant mortality rate has decreased by 6.6%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dr. Wagner, the Minister of Public Health of the National Socialist Party, declared that Führer Hitler will issue an order to award commemorative medals to mothers of large families across the country, because the National Socialist Party's racial policy is to increase the population.

<h3>American Missionary Jones Sends Letter Proclaiming to the Japanese People</h3>
<p>Aggression Against China is the Greatest International Crime; Disrupting International Peace is Damaging Own Interests</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Dr. Jones, a famous American missionary stationed in India, once authored "Two Books of Christ on the Great Road of India," which were widely circulated. Dr. Jones recently returned to India from the United States and, while passing through Shanghai, drafted a three-thousand-word letter to the Japanese people, urging them to lay down their arms as soon as possible to avoid regretting it later. The letter stated that the current Japanese aggression against China is the greatest international crime, that this act not only antagonizes China but also disrupts international peace, and so on. However, the Japanese people are now controlled by their warlords, and the doctor's advice is like throwing water on a stone, ineffective. However, it is enough to show a glimpse of public opinion.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Refugee Relief Problem</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, large numbers of refugees have emerged from military zones everywhere. These are people who have lost their livelihoods due to the war. Currently, Shanghai alone has at least a hundred thousand people. These hundred thousand people have now escaped the war zone with their lives. However, where is their destination in the vast future? Keeping refugees in cities and relying solely on shelters and relief is naturally not a solution. Similarly, this kind of unplanned repatriation is hardly a good policy. This unplanned repatriation merely results in one less group of refugees in location A and one more group of refugees in location B. The serious problem of refugees remains fundamentally unresolved. Furthermore, the current war of resistance is by no means a local affair. If location A can become a war zone today, what's to say location B can't become a war zone tomorrow? Then, they will be repatriated from location B to location C. Such a repeated migration will only result in an increasing number of refugees and an increasingly chaotic rear.</p>
<p>Therefore, fundamental refugee relief cannot be effectively achieved by relying solely on passive shelters and repatriation. A thorough solution must be approached from a proactive perspective. This so-called proactive approach can be divided into two points.</p>
<p>First, is to enable those who have already become refugees to regain a path to livelihood.</p>
<p>Second, is to prevent those who have not yet become refugees from becoming refugees.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, the Executive Yuan recently passed a set of measures for refugee relief during this extraordinary period. The main contents are: ㊀ Establish a general relief committee in the capital, with branches in various locations, to handle relief matters. ㊁ Refugees without working ability will be sheltered locally or moved to nearby areas. ㊂ Refugees with working ability will be properly allocated, taking into account the number of people and the working environment, and sent to their respective towns to assist in production or transportation. Alternatively, they will be assigned work within local defense organizations and other groups. ㊃ Those refugees who wish to serve in the military will have their families taken care of. ㊄ Provide education for refugee children who have dropped out of school. ㊅ The funds for the general relief committee will come from the central disaster relief reserve fund and designated special funds or donations. The funds for the branches will come from the original relief organizations and charitable groups' funds, local disaster relief funds, and donations. This approach is naturally a very proactive measure. If it can be implemented in an orderly manner according to the law, we believe there will definitely be results. If not, we cannot help but offer some supplementary opinions here. ㊀ This approach still lacks regulations regarding the relationship between the general and branch committees (the county branches are stipulated to be under the unified planning of the provincial branches). Precisely because this war of resistance is comprehensive, everything should have a unified plan. For example, which places can accommodate refugees without working ability? Also, for example, where should refugees with working ability go to produce? What should they produce? All of these must be planned comprehensively at the national level and decided by the general committee, then issued to the branch committees for execution. If the relationship is not specified and each province acts independently, we fear that many shortcomings will arise in the future. ㊁ A special arrangement should be made for skilled mechanical laborers among the refugees. These people should not only not be dispersed or allowed to engage in other work, but should also be quickly ordered to concentrate in the rear. Not only are these laborers workers in wartime industries themselves, but they can also train many new mechanical laborers, increasing the strength of wartime production. ㊂ We believe that refugees with working ability should be planned by the relief committee to designate appropriate venues, classified and gathered according to their profession before being assigned to work. For example, classified and gathered according to farmers, textile workers, match workers, etc. Those with too few people in the same profession can be grouped together with similar professions. In this way, when workers are needed, they can be quickly summoned.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, how to prevent those who have not yet become refugees from becoming refugees. The government has not yet promulgated a suitable approach to this problem, but we seem to have several opinions that we can contribute. ㊀ In places that may become war zones in the near future, measures should be prepared in advance to engage in the organization of the people. For example, with farmers, villages and towns should be quickly organized to unite and plan for future development. In this way, once something happens, they can quickly retreat to a new destination as a group and engage in production again. Or, for example, factories. Those that can be relocated should be relocated first. Otherwise, workers should be organized in advance to plan for future destinations. Five minutes before the enemy approaches, the entire staff, machinery, and raw materials should be evacuated to the new destination as quickly as possible. If this can be done in a proactive manner, it will certainly not be as embarrassing as the refugees in Shanghai today. ㊁ Factories, shops, and institutions in various locations can reduce salaries or increase working hours for all employees during this extraordinary period, but layoffs should be strictly prohibited. We know that laying off one person means losing the livelihood of one person or one family, which also means one or more refugees. At this time, it is better for everyone to eat one less bowl of rice, but everyone must eat the rice. Recently, some shops and institutions in Shanghai have nominally kept salaries intact, but have laid off many employees in tangible and intangible ways. This self-deceiving strategy of creating refugees should be improved in any case. Taking a step back, even if layoffs are necessary due to unavoidable reasons, those with high incomes should be laid off. In this way, although one person becomes unemployed and becomes a refugee, it has prevented several or dozens of low-income earners from becoming refugees. Moreover, in fact, because high-income earners usually have rich incomes and more savings, they may not become refugees even if they are laid off.</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Refuse to Participate in Mediterranean Conference</h3>
<p>Using Soviet Russia's Provocation as an Excuse; Conference Scheduled to Proceed Today in Rome</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Mediterranean Conference, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano presented a reply to the British and Italian chargé d'affaires, White Longtel, and the French chargé d'affaires in Italy, England, this morning, stating that the Italian government had originally intended to accept this invitation. However, because the Soviet Union had sent two notes to Italy, the Italian government decided to postpone its consent until the dispute between Italy and the Soviet Union was satisfactorily resolved. However, the Italian government is prepared to promptly conduct talks with the relevant countries, which should be conducted within the London Non-Intervention Committee, so that countries not invited to participate in the Nyon Conference, such as Portugal and Poland, can also attend. In addition, the Italian government still intends to continue to participate in the Non-Intervention Committee. If the Mediterranean issue is submitted to the Committee for discussion, the Italian government is prepared to instruct its representatives to attend. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding participation in the Mediterranean Conference, the German government presented replies to the British ambassador and the French chargé d'affaires this morning, stating that the German government had originally prepared to cooperate with various countries on this matter. However, due to the Soviet Union's repeated provocations against Italy, the German government fears that the Mediterranean Conference will fail. Therefore, it proposes that the Mediterranean issue should be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee for discussion, so that countries not invited to participate in the Nyon Conference can also attend. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After Italy and Germany exchanged opinions for several days regarding the Mediterranean Conference, a result was reached today. Officials here declared that the Italian government will respond to the invitations from Britain and France soon. In addition, according to those in charge in Italy, the Soviet government's two notes to Italy regarding the sinking of Italian ships by submarines have made it increasingly difficult for Germany and Italy to participate in the Mediterranean Conference. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union, seeing that relations between Britain and Italy have improved, will be isolated. Therefore, it is engaging in divisive tactics, hoping to reverse this. However, Italy is currently dismissing this strategy of the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Hirschfeld, and Spanish Republican Government Premier Negrin this morning. The French delegation to the Mediterranean Conference is said to be composed of Foreign Minister Delbos, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Darlan, Deputy Chief of Staff Admiral Godfroy, and several senior officials from the Foreign Ministry. Those in charge declared that after ships of various countries in the Mediterranean were attacked, the situation is becoming increasingly serious, and various measures must be taken immediately to prevent new incidents from occurring. Foreign Minister Delbos is now scheduled to leave for Geneva at 10:20 tomorrow evening with British Foreign Secretary Eden. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Enemy Planes Rampage Everywhere, Innocent Civilians Tragically Bombed</h3>
<p>Disseminating Absurd and Shameless Leaflets</p>
<p>Yesterday, enemy planes again carried out indiscriminate bombing in the South City, Pudong, and other areas. At around 7:00 AM, three enemy planes flew low over the South City to reconnoiter and dropped four bombs in Gaochangmiao, Rihuigang, and other places, injuring fifteen people and killing four, destroying more than twenty houses. Another plane flying higher dropped three bombs in the Longhua area. At around 9:00 AM, six enemy planes dropped five bombs in Longhua and Gaochangmiao, seriously injuring one person and lightly injuring three, destroying more than ten houses. Three bombs were also dropped near the South Railway Station, causing minimal damage. At 1:00 PM, one enemy plane flew over Gaochangmiao again to reconnoiter and dropped one bomb. At around 2:00 PM, four enemy planes dropped twelve bombs, causing slight damage to houses. Four of the bombs did not explode. At around 4:00 PM, nine enemy planes dropped three bombs in the Pudong area, destroying several houses.</p>
<h3>South City's Longhua Suffers Rampant Destruction</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, at around 7:00 AM, a large squadron of enemy bombers flew to bomb the South City and western Shanghai. It is estimated that at 7:20 AM, they flew to the area of Rihui Bridge outside the South City, the northern end of Beipiao Wharf, and Longhua Road, dropping more than ten bombs, destroying more than fifty civilian houses and killing and injuring thirty to forty civilians. The Longtong Machine Paper Mill in that area was also hit by two bombs, injuring two workers. They then returned after scattering absurd and ridiculous leaflets that were not worth laughing at in the city of South City. At around 1:30 PM in the afternoon, several enemy planes flew to Rihui Bridge, Longhua Road, Dapu Bridge, Gaochangmiao Guangdong Street, Chenjiaqiao, and other areas, dropping as many as twenty bombs. Fortunately, the residents in the area were prepared and hid in a room in advance. Only a few coolies and poor people were unable to escape and were injured by the bombs. The injured civilians were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment by the West District Rescue Shen and Red Cross rescue teams. The corpses of those killed by the bombs have been buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall and Pushan Villa burial teams. However, the corpses in the collapsed houses are still being searched for and buried. Also, the Zhengnan Grocery Store at No. 935 Longhua Road, the rice stores at No. 937, No. 939, No. 941, and other market houses, and Gengyu Lane at No. 933, were all set on fire and extinguished by the fire brigades from the West and South districts.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, several enemy planes suddenly scattered a large number of leaflets over the city of South City. There were about four types, and the wording and content were absurd and ridiculous. Citizens who picked them up scoffed after reading them. They thought they had exhausted their ability to provoke and threaten and were smug, but we already knew that they were at the end of their rope and that their efforts were in vain.</p>
<h3>Yinxiang Township Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Yesterday from 10:00 to 11:00 AM, the central area of the city suffered heavy bombing. The vicinity of the Far East Sports Ground was also occasionally attacked by artillery fire. After 11:00 AM, near the Songhu Railway west of the Hongkou Swimming Pool, artillery shells occasionally fell. At noon, a big fire broke out in the central area of the city. From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, there was machine gun fighting in Baoshan Road near the North Station, and there was also artillery fire in Zhongxing Road north of the North Station. Enemy planes also dropped bombs in the vicinity of the Far East Sports Ground. From 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, several high-altitude artillery shells fell near Makgen Road (near Wuding Road), injuring one person. Two bullets did not explode. There was machine gun fighting in Baoshan Road, and there was also artillery fire near the old plant of the Commercial Press. From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, there was still artillery fire from the old plant of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, and the northwest area of the Far East Sports Ground was heavily bombed.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Injure People in the Central District of the Concession</h3>
<p>㊀ Yesterday at around 5:45 PM, a shell suddenly fell from the sky near the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road, Jiangxi Road, and exploded immediately. At that time, more than twenty passers-by were injured, and several died instantly. The remaining injured were quickly sent to Renji Hospital for treatment in three ambulances dispatched by the Central Police Station. On the one hand, the police collected the shrapnel and, after studying it, determined that it was a high-altitude artillery shell fired from a Japanese warship. It was also heard that, apart from slight damage to the road surface and the shaking of the glass windows on both sides of the buildings, there was no major damage at the bombing site. ㊁ At 2:30 PM, a huge artillery shell fell on the houses at No. 112, No. 96, No. 33, and other houses at No. 90 Long Makgen Road, Wuding Road. The sound shook far and wide, and several houses were destroyed on the spot, but fortunately no one was injured. ㊂ At around 3:00 PM, while the Yihe Silk Filature at No. 1037 North Chengdu Road was working, an artillery shell as big as a flower tube suddenly flew into the window of the building, and with a loud noise, many female workers were injured by the bombing and were sent to the hospital by car. Two female workers died of serious injuries. At the same time, one man and one woman were killed by stray bullets in Siwen Lane.</p>
<h3>Impressions of American Residents Leaving</h3>
<p>Western newspapers report various opinions; the main views of American merchants in this port.</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports: "Today (the 9th), news was received in Shanghai that the 1,200 American residents gathered in Hankou will take the Yuehan Railway to Guangzhou tomorrow. Among them are family members of the Hankou American Consulate staff, as well as American merchants and missionaries and their families from surrounding areas. The Hankou American Consulate will continue to operate as usual. This morning, when Western newspaper reporters met with Japanese military authorities, someone asked if Japanese aircraft would attack the train. Spokespersons for the Japanese Army and Navy stated that they had not yet received notification of the train's departure. It is likely that the Japanese Embassy has received this notification. As this train is neutral, Japanese aircraft will naturally not bomb it." The "North China Daily News" reports that American merchants in Shanghai with professional businesses reiterated yesterday (the 8th) their decision to remain in Shanghai and not abandon their vested interests due to the temporary dangers to their lives and property caused by the Sino-Japanese War. American residents in China have generally been lukewarm to President Roosevelt's warning that all Americans should leave China. Several American merchants in this port hold the view that the U.S. government will no longer protect Americans and their interests in China, believing it's a matter of "every man for himself". One person even said that the U.S. government's action is merely to appease several powerful peace advocacy groups. Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, is still following government orders and issued a notice last night regarding procedures for American residents leaving China, planning to use several warships to transport American residents out of China, and listing the departure dates of the ships from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Quarantine Implemented for Those Arriving from Hongkou and East Shanghai</h3>
<p>Preventing cholera, typhoid, and other diseases</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department has recently discovered cases of true cholera and typhoid in the Hongkou area and eastern Shanghai. To prevent the spread of these diseases, it has been decided that starting today, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, anyone entering south of the Suzhou River from the Hongkou Eastern District, whether on foot or by vehicle, must undergo quarantine by the Health Department before being allowed to pass, in order to prevent the spread of infection. Quarantine doctors will be stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge (Garden Bridge) to conduct inspections.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Releases Refugee Statistics</h3>
<p>Free water for refugees</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 8th of this month, there are 118 refugee shelters within the International Settlement inspected by the Council's Health Department, housing a total of 60,407 refugees. On the 8th of this month, 1,545 refugees were vaccinated, and 1,009 refugees received preventive injections.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company is providing free water to the refugee shelters, limited to 10 million gallons. This amount is estimated to last for six months. In addition to expressing its gratitude to the company, the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that this contribution is of great benefit in resolving the difficulties of the refugee problem.</p>
<h3>YWCA Wartime Service Work</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Shanghai YWCA on Xiang'an Temple Road has taken on the responsibility of serving the country. In addition to leading women throughout Shanghai in carrying out consolation work, it is also making every effort to engage in relief and rescue work. The following is a brief report on wartime services over the past few weeks: (1) Serving the wounded soldiers; (2) Serving the refugees; (3) Organizing women throughout Shanghai to provide relevant wartime work; (4) Opening the YWCA building as a center for wartime work for women throughout Shanghai; (5) Providing relief to foreign residents in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>KMT Training School Alumni Establish National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Kuomintang Training Institute was the only training organization for specialized personnel in Party affairs, agriculture, and labor during the successful Northern Expedition ten years ago. The institute has trained no less than a thousand alumni. In recent years, these alumni have been distributed in various sectors, including Party and government administration, the military, industry, finance, law, and the press, and are mostly talented, hardworking, and experienced individuals. Recently, due to the unceasing aggression and massacres by the brutal Japanese, alumni have gathered to organize a National Salvation Association in order to resist the enemy and seek self-preservation. The inaugural meeting was held yesterday at the Shanghai clubhouse, with over a hundred alumni in attendance. In addition to passing the organizational charter and work outline, twenty-one executive committee members, including Wang Fuji and Zhu Yunsheng, were elected, as well as eight alternate executive committee members, including Yu Yuanjue and Long Peiyun. It is heard that the association's activities will focus on practical and effective actions to resist the enemy. To concentrate efforts and prevent the rise of traitors, a strict registration process will begin immediately at 524 Baker Road (Cheng Lu Road), in the British Concession, to prepare for action. In recent days, registration at the association has been enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>British Firms Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson Restore Shanghai-Tianjin Routes</h3>
<p>Regular operation of foreign ships on upper and middle Yangtze River routes</p>
<p>British shipping companies Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, in order to maintain China's coastal shipping, have restored the following routes: (1) Southern Route: Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. Butterfield &amp; Swire is using the Taiyuan and Jinan, while Jardine Matheson is using the Desheng and Yisheng. However, the number of ships has been reduced compared to before. (2) Northern Route: Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai, Jin. Service has been restored since yesterday. Butterfield &amp; Swire is using the Shengjing and Shuntian, while Jardine Matheson is using the Lisheng and Dingsheng. In addition to carrying cargo, passenger tickets are also being sold. (3) Shanghai-Ningbo Route: Butterfield &amp; Swire is using the Xin Beijing. The Longshan and Shenfu are also specially dispatched to this route to transport refugees. (4) Upper and Middle Yangtze River Routes: Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, as well as the Italian firm's Yihua and the French firm's Jufu, are all dispatching ships as usual. However, the lower Yangtze River route, i.e., the Shanghai-Hankou line, is completely suspended because it has been blockaded by China.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Company's Wage Reduction Strike Settled</h3>
<p>Representatives of all employees of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, including Jin Zhizhi, submitted requests to Party and government agencies for mediation due to the company's layoffs and wage reductions. The Municipal Party Committee sent Li Weixiong, and the Bureau of Social Affairs sent Du Liang to mediate. They persuaded the workers to maintain order in the rear during the war of resistance and not to take rash actions. After investigation, it was found that the company had no intention of laying off employees, but only temporarily reduced wages to half-pay. Compared to other factories that have suspended operations and caused unemployment, this should not be considered a major grievance. After thorough discussions, the workers expressed their understanding, and the strike at the company has been settled.</p>
<h3>Rōnin and Traitors Use Poisoned Candy to Lure and Kill Children</h3>
<p>Police agencies on high alert; attention of children's families</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese and Korean rōnin and traitors have been making highly poisonous drugs into pills, coated with a sugar shell, in red, yellow, white, and other colors, resembling ordinary candies. They distribute these pills to unsuspecting children along the way. After eating the pills, the children are poisoned and cannot be saved. The city's police agencies have seized several of these poisoned pills and have notified all districts to conduct strict surveillance. It is hoped that citizens with children will pay attention and not fall victim to the enemy's poison scheme.</p>
<h3>Citywide Broadcasting Stations' Wartime Unified Propaganda</h3>

Article 8: These measures will be discussed and implemented jointly by this association and the Broadcasting Industry Association. All member stations will abide by them. Any future amendments must be made with the consent of both parties.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Artillery Battle This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Extremely intense artillery fire shook the city; our forces firmly defend the Qiujiang Wharf and Jungong Road; our troops have recovered Wujiazai in Luodian.</p>
<p>As of 3:00 PM today, although the enemy has tried its best to fiercely attack our army's positions on all fronts, our army is firmly defending its original lines, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The main points of the battle situation are as follows: (1) The Qiujiang Wharf area remains the focus of the battle. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River and heavy enemy artillery in Yangshupu fiercely bombed our Yinxianggang positions this morning. Our army fought back with all its might, killing countless enemies. Currently, there are no traces of the enemy in the area west of Jungong Road and north of Wuquan Road. (2) The enemy in Wusong and Baoshan attacked our positions northeast of Yanghang in two directions. After a bloody battle, they have been repelled. We are firmly defending our original lines. (3) Fierce fighting is taking place in the Yuepu area. The enemy is suffering heavy casualties, and our lines remain unmoved. (4) In the Luodian area, after fierce fighting last night, our army has recovered Wujiaqiao and Xiaojintang north of Changqiao. (5) In the Zhabei area, the enemy launched several assaults last night and this morning, but all were repelled by our army. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. (6) Enemy warships in the Huangpu River fiercely bombed our Pudong positions starting at 10:30 AM today. Our army's heavy artillery also returned fire, and the intense artillery fire continued until 2:00 PM before stopping.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Units Display Their Power</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Starting at 10:30 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River again shelled our Pudong positions. Our army's heavy artillery immediately returned fire. By 11:00 AM, our artillery fire became even more intense, shaking all of Shanghai. It concentrated on the Japanese Mail Steamship Company pier, enemy warships in the Huangpu River, and enemy military positions in eastern Shanghai. Unable to withstand our intense firepower, the enemy ordered five enemy aircraft to take off at 12:05 PM to scout out our army's artillery positions in Pudong. They circled for about a quarter of an hour and dropped four bombs, all of which landed in the fields and did not explode. The enemy aircraft then left in disappointment at 12:30 PM. However, in less than five minutes, our army's artillery units continued their activity, and the enemy warships also returned fire. As of the time of publication, both sides were still fiercely exchanging fire.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warship Nearly Hit</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) This morning, a very large Red Cross medical ship belonging to the enemy arrived in the Huangpu River and docked at the Mitsubishi pier to collect wounded enemy soldiers and transport bodies onto the ship. An enemy Yangtze River shallow-draft warship was anchored in the center of the river outside the Chunjiang pier for protection. Enemy ship number 30 was anchored in front of the Zhaoshang Middle Pier, and the enemy flagship Izumo was docked at the second river pier, with a destroyer nearby to protect it. At around 5:00 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River began firing on Pudong. By 10:50 AM, the artillery fire became increasingly dense. The four enemy warships fired in rotation, firing about one shell every minute. At 11:05 AM, our artillery also returned fire with heavy guns. With a loud bang, the reporter witnessed a wisp of black smoke falling straight towards the river in front of the Chunjiang pier. The shell landed in the Huangpu River outside the port side of the enemy warship, no more than a few feet from the bow of the ship, almost hitting it. The enemy warship was panicked and quickly turned its bow to the right, while enemy ship number 30, which was docked at the Middle Pier, indiscriminately bombarded the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>(Latest News from This Newspaper) The reporter learned from reliable sources that the reason for the fierce artillery battle that occurred this afternoon was that our military authorities had received confidential reports that the enemy warships had recently transported a large number of heavy artillery and giant tanks and other heavy weapons, which were scheduled to be unloaded ashore at the Huishan and other piers in eastern Shanghai at around 12:00 noon today. Therefore, our army immediately ordered our forces in Pudong to bombard the piers fiercely to blunt their edge.</p>
<h3>Jungong Road Still in Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Our troops charged into melee combat more than ten times; the enemy suffered attacks from the front and rear, with heavy casualties.</p>
<p>At Qiujiang Wharf, our forces and the enemy forces continue to fiercely battle day and night, holding each other in the Jungong Road area. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River are constantly shelling our positions with fierce artillery fire, and more than ten enemy aircraft are flying low and bombing our positions. Our defending army bravely fought, charging into melee combat more than ten times. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. Yesterday evening, the enemy was repelled. In the evening, our army's unit attacked the enemy near Fengjiazai from near Lujiazai and Huojiazai, attacking from the front and rear. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and could not hold out, and retreated eastward along Jungong Road. Currently, there are no traces of the enemy north of Wuquan Road and west of Jungong Road.</p>
<p>(Special Reading from This Newspaper) In the past three days, bloody battles have fully unfolded on all fronts in Shanghai. Among them, the line from Qiujiang Wharf to Jungong Road has been the fiercest. The following is an approximate record of what a military officer who participated in the battle on that line said: (1) The enemy has been continuously increasing reinforcements at Qiujiang Wharf in the past few days, especially many of them. According to reports, since the war front has been expanding outwards, the enemy is launching an all-out attack, but it is still difficult for all fronts to develop. Therefore, it is seeking another way out, attempting to seize the city center to Jiangwan area in one fell swoop and cut off our army's rear. However, our side was prepared and the enemy's plan became a dream after two days of attack. (2) Yesterday at dawn, when the enemy advanced from Qiujiang Wharf across Jungong Road, it used six heavy tanks as the vanguard, followed by infantry and artillery. The momentum was extremely fierce. A certain unit of our army calmly responded to the attack. For about half an hour, it had charged into our position. Later, reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce attack, with every shot hitting the target. The enemy could not withstand it and retreated backwards. We took advantage of the victory to pursue and eliminate them, not only recapturing the position, but also advancing to a distance of three li away and building a new position. The enemy suffered a heavy blow from this and did not dare to attack again. (3) Yesterday at 10:00 AM, more than twenty enemy aircraft hovered over the city center and bombed indiscriminately. The intention was nothing more than to vent their anger over the failure of the attack. At that time, our army lay still in the trenches to avoid their edge. The enemy aircraft did not leave until about 1:00 PM. Within these three hours, shells rained down, at least 500 or more. Our soldiers suffered more than 60 casualties, but countless civilian houses were destroyed. (4) On all fronts, our army has sufficient strength and proper equipment. If the enemy comes to attack, we will surely eliminate them and will not stop until the enemy is wiped out.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Wusong Attacks Yanghang</h3>
<p>Fierce fighting between the two sides northeast of Yanghang; the enemy was defeated and fled in a panic.</p>
<p>The enemy in Wusong has intentions to attack our Yanghang. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy, led by tanks, advanced towards our position, coming from the directions of Sanguantang and Taojiazai. They encountered our army northeast of Yanghang and fierce fighting broke out. Our army in that area has a strong force and bravely fought back. Last night, the enemy forces in that area were defeated and fled in a panic. Our army's positions were not lost at all.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Main Force Attacks the Yuepu Line</h3>
<p>We Responded Fiercely and Destroyed Enemy Vehicles; the Enemy Was Forced to Retreat with Many Deaths</p>
<p>On the Yuepu line, extremely fierce fighting occurred last night. The enemy attacked with its main force, with more than ten tanks operating on the front line, followed by infantry. At the same time, enemy warships in the river bombarded our positions with continuous heavy artillery fire, and enemy aircraft were also active in the air. Shells and bombs rained down. Our defending army calmly responded to the attack and used mortars to aim at the enemy vehicles and bombard them fiercely, destroying many of them. The enemy was forced to retreat, and our army firmly defended its original positions, standing still. In last night's battle, our defending army suffered approximately more than one hundred casualties, and the enemy's deaths were countless.</p>
<h3>We Recaptured Wujiazai in Luodian</h3>
<p>Two Enemy Tanks Destroyed</p>
<p>In the Luodian area, after our army recaptured key areas such as Changqiao and Fengjiazai the day before yesterday, the enemy army launched a fierce counterattack against our army. Fierce battles broke out between the two armies in Wujiazai and Xiaojintang. Our army followed each other, charging with hand grenades and other weapons, and destroyed two enemy tanks. The enemy suffered too many casualties and retreated. Our army advanced and completely recovered Wujiazai and other places. According to reports, the enemy's main force is concentrated on the Luodian and Yuepu lines, attempting to establish contact on these two lines. The enemy forces near Changquan are only a small group.</p>
<h3>Air Battle Occurred in Zhabei This Morning</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Dropped Two Bombs in Nanshi Without Damage; Reconnaissance Aircraft Straſed Villages in Pudong</p>
<p>From 6:00 AM to 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs on our army's positions in the sky above Qingyun Road in Zhabei city center. Although our army used anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns to bomb them at the time, the enemy aircraft still dropped bombs as usual. Later, a large force of our air force learned of this and rushed to the scene, and a fierce air battle broke out between the two sides. The sound of fighting shook the sky for about an hour. At about 7:00 AM, the enemy aircraft could not hold out and fled to the clouds and escaped to the east.</p>
<p>At about 6:00 AM this morning, another nine enemy aircraft flew from Nanshi along the river to Gaochangmiao and Longhua Road, dropping two bombs. The sound was huge, and the houses shook. After the investigation, they all landed in the mud, fortunately without damage.</p>
<p>At about 12:00 noon this morning, seven or eight Japanese aircraft flew to the area bordering ×× in Pudong, conducting reconnaissance separately, and using machine guns to strafe various villages, and releasing red and green flares to send signals to traitors. However, after our army's strict crackdown, traitors have greatly decreased, so the strange signals that were discovered in the past few days were not seen in various places. The enemy aircraft did not fly back until dawn.</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Use Italian-Soviet Estrangement to Promote the Anti-Comintern Pact Between Italy and Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassadors to Britain and France Confer in London</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, and the Japanese Ambassador to France, Sugimura, recently held talks here, with particular emphasis on the establishment of an Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Italy. Regarding this meeting, Japanese officials in London were quite reticent but admitted that Sugimura had come to Britain from Paris to meet with Yoshida to discuss the international situation. They also stated that all countries opposed to communism could participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany. As for the talks between Japan and Italy, they have been going on for some time, but have not yet reached the final stage. British sources familiar with the situation recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech in Palermo last month, criticizing communism. Moreover, relations between the Soviet Union and Italy have become strained due to the Soviet ship attack incident. All of this makes it easier to expand the scope of the anti-communist group. (Central News Agency, 9th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Our Country's Confidence in Resistance Against Japan is Very Strong</h3>
<p>Statement by Vice President Kong</p>
<p>[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, who is currently recuperating at Bad Nauheim Spa, recently gave a statement to various newspapers, saying, "After the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Japan complained a lot, but they should know that Germany had also established a Non-Aggression Treaty with Poland (January 26, 1934), and Poland had also signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union (July 3, 1933). This means that there is also an indirect relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, and we have not said anything against Germany. Moreover, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Neutrality (April 24, 1916) was extended in 1933 by the Third Reich. Japan seems to have forgotten this. According to the argument held by Japan, any country that signs a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union should be considered a Bolshevik country or at risk of being communist. If this is the case, then in addition to Poland, countries such as Finland and Turkey are also suspected of being communist." Vice President Kong then condemned Japan's actions, saying, "Where does Japan place international law in its unwarranted war against China? Japan promised to respect the Open Door Policy within 'Manchukuo.' Where is this principle now? Compared to other countries, China is not behind and has sufficient strength to live peacefully with any country. Japan's invasion of China is not the first time. The unification that China has worked so hard to achieve over the years has been strengthened by Japan's acts of aggression. At present, China is very confident and will never be discouraged by defeat or arrogant by victory," etc. (Central News Agency, 9th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Unless Absolutely Necessary, Businesses Should Remain Open as Usual</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, stating that the Chamber has received instructions from the Municipal Government that businesses in all towns and cities should not be allowed to close unless absolutely necessary or ordered by the government. This is because the daily needs of frontline soldiers and urban residents are indispensable. Once business is suspended, it will not only cause difficulties for residents, but also result in the accumulation of goods and the inability to circulate them smoothly. Therefore, all industries in the city are notified that those that have already opened for business should circulate goods as much as possible and maintain the livelihoods of their employees, and those that have not yet opened for business should resume business as soon as possible. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>North and South Seas Shipping Routes Gradually Unblocked</h3>

<h3>Brief Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that when Japanese planes bombed the South Railway Station, there were no soldiers to be seen. The day before yesterday, they bombed a refugee train departing from Shanghai in Songjiang, killing and injuring seven or eight hundred people. Their barbaric actions are truly like demons in the forest. Since the beginning of the Second Shanghai Incident, the enemy has brutally killed countless innocent people. Even a third party who sees this cannot help but feel righteous indignation and loudly denounce it. How should our people, who have experienced it firsthand, recognize this terrifying and ferocious face and engrave it permanently in their minds?</p>
<p>According to news from Baoding, the Third Division of the puppet Manchurian army, under enemy orders, traveled from Rehe to Chicheng and suddenly announced their revolt. This is both possible and inevitable. The reason why our country's troops rashly defected was nothing more than being lured and threatened by the enemy, causing their conscience and ability to be temporarily obscured. Now that they see our country's loyal and brave soldiers fighting bloody battles, pressing forward despite sacrifices, this spark of unawakened conscience must be struck and revived like the embers of a dying fire.</p>

<h3>Writing to Friends Who Care About Relief Work (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xiaoming</p>
<p>Currently, the work we urgently need to do is to build a bridge for military-civilian exchange. This means that our relief work on the Shanghai front cannot rely solely on the wounded soldier hospitals run by the people of Shanghai to accommodate as many people as possible. We need the military medical authorities to also take responsibility for accommodating wounded soldiers. In fact, the people have indeed taken on the responsibility of relief, and the military medical authorities have also taken on the responsibility of relief. Moreover, the distribution of military medical hospitals and hygiene stations has long been very detailed and equipped. Therefore, in order to adapt to the preparations for a protracted war of resistance, as long as we can do our best to channel wounded soldiers from Shanghai, we can complete our greatest task, and we can maintain the Shanghai wounded soldier hospitals' ability to continuously accommodate wounded soldiers without feeling panicked. Now, this bridge for military-civilian exchange has fortunately been built. Therefore, many people anxiously worry that the wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai will not be enough to accommodate them. This is taking the Shanghai concessions too much as a safe rear and neglecting the capabilities and safe equipment of the military authorities. They also do not know the strength of the wounded soldier hospitals run by many people in the interior. Although we still hope that a large number of wounded soldier hospitals will appear in Shanghai, the bridge of military-civilian exchange that we should have does not allow us to ignore it, does not allow us to disregard the future situation of a protracted war of resistance, and sincerely hopes that anxious friends will contribute more financial and human resources and try to establish several large-scale wounded soldier hospitals.</p>
<p>I think the treatment of wounded soldiers should not be too generous, nor should it be too meager. For example, if a wounded soldier has already suffered a serious injury, no matter how delicious and delicious you give him, he will not be able to enjoy it. If they suddenly become pampered after just coming out of a difficult and dangerous environment, this change in psychology can easily lead to people's laziness and complacency. Seeing this once will only be harmful to the future of the war of resistance and not beneficial. The most ideal hope is that we only need to give them some palatable food and relatively nutritious food, which is very good. I think it is better to expand the number of beds and accommodate more injured people with the money that has too much consumption, which is more practical. As for people who genuinely abuse wounded soldiers, they should not only be condemned by their conscience, but also be abandoned and condemned by 400 million compatriots. We pray that China will no longer see such people who are equivalent to traitors.</p>
<p>Regarding consolation matters, of course, they need to be centrally distributed. I very much hope that there will also be a special organization for consolation. Otherwise, it is also a solution to concentrate on the Red Cross or local associations for distribution. Many people think that personally going to the wounded soldiers' beds to console them will give themselves more comfort, and the wounded soldiers will also be comforted. In fact, talking more with the wounded soldiers consumes more of the wounded soldiers' energy, providing more consolation food to the wounded soldiers causes more gastrointestinal diseases, and even traitors take the opportunity of consolation to spy on military information. Shameless people see that consolation is profitable and want to run wounded soldier hospitals by operating under the guise of absorbing consolation items to enrich their own pockets. The number of malpractices is countless. If there is an agency for consolation items that can be centrally distributed, first, all the wounded soldiers in Shanghai can enjoy them equally in terms of materials, and second, in terms of spirit, some specialized consolation service talents can be trained. Within the prescribed time, they can give the wounded soldiers the most needed comfort and considerable education, and serve them in practice. Like the spirit, methods, and discipline of today's children's service team, it is a very good example.</p>
<p>To what extent has the relief work been done today? Of course, I cannot answer rashly. As a certain gentleman aptly put it, it is better to do it than not to do it. Just like the families who have always hosted weddings, funerals, and joyous occasions, how can they be completely satisfactory? The result is the same. We are very willing to work hard to improve in various ways without taking the peaceful method, with daydreams, regardless of the facts, , don't think about steps, just split hairs, and don't seek the source, you can improve the relief work. We must not criticize or blame people lightly without having personally experienced it or considered it carefully. A certain female doctor once absurdly said that without using blood transfusion therapy, all therapies are 18th-century therapies. This serious mistake shows that many accidental events are too easily emotionally impulsive without taking time to choose words. How can the layman's words of a doctor, which are spoken without thinking, affect the society's anger among people who do not know medicine!</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will give enthusiastic support to relief work. We cannot overestimate the level of relief work, nor can we underestimate it. Those who preside over and handle relief work cannot laugh and scold others. We must take care of ourselves. We must prepare for long-term savings, not fight for fear, and on the two principles that relief of wounded soldiers and medical treatment of wounded soldiers should be given equal importance, how to treat wounded soldiers well, how to transport wounded soldiers, how to educate wounded soldiers, how to respect sudden changes in unified places, how to respect the decisions of central relief agencies, how to concentrate talents and resources, how to achieve military-civilian exchanges, how to rescue wounded soldiers on the battlefield, and how to make healed wounded soldiers more ambitious to kill the enemy, This is the direction for improving relief work, and it is also a victory for the Chinese nation in the overall war of resistance.</p>
<h3>Beijing Municipal Government Implements Community-Based Joint Defense</h3>
<p>Strengthening the Self-Defense Power of the People and Persuading Traitors to Quickly Repent</p>
<p>South East Communication reports that in order to adapt to the needs of the extraordinary period and strengthen the people's self-defense power, the Beijing Municipal Government has convened representatives from party, government, military police, and other agencies to decide on handling community-based joint defense matters. It is heard that in the urban area, the Municipal Government has decided to appoint two joint defense organizers per district to go to each district to assist the district offices in organizing. The honorary joint defense organizers will be appointed by the Municipal Government upon request from each district and institute, and will be held by leaders of legal entities in each district or local respected figures who are enthusiastic about serving. The organization of joint defense will establish a total of 64 groups in the entire urban area, with one group leader per group. However, depending on the actual needs, one or three deputy group leaders will be set up, and a joint defense office will be set up for every ten groups, with one director, one or two deputy directors, and one clerk, all of whom will be appointed by the Municipal Government. As for the joint defense procedures, households will be registered first, with each house number being one household. If there are more than two families in one house number, it will still be counted as one household and numbered as the number of the district, group, and household. The police house number will be used as the district group household number to avoid re-making house numbers. After the joint defense households have completed their organization, they will prepare a clear list of household heads, a brief description of the group and joint defense, and the joint defense director and deputy director will lead the household heads and Zhuang Ding to assist the district head in handling self-defense work during the extraordinary period. Each group should also convene joint defense meetings of household heads at any time to agree on regulations. If necessary, joint defense pledges may also be held.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Government also stated that this war of resistance against Japan is truly the last juncture for the survival of our Chinese nation. All of our compatriots, even those with a little bit of blood, are determined to fight the enemy to the end. Whether it is the soldiers at the front or the people in the rear, although their tasks are different, their determination to risk death to revive our nation and consolidate our country is the same. However, in recent days, a small number of people with lost hearts and mad minds have been found in various places, taking advantage of the enemy's temporary petty profits, disregarding our entire nation, and willingly becoming traitors. Their crime is unforgivable, and their foolishness is also pitiful. Therefore, we do not hesitate to make a final appeal, hoping that they will quickly wake up, briefly stating: ㊀ Some people become traitors because they are unemployed and have no choice. However, they do not know that unemployment is a temporary setback for an individual. If they are not disabled, there is no reason to be unemployed for life. Recently, the government is rescuing unemployed people. If unemployed people apply for relief, the government will properly find ways to help them. Why bother to be greedy for temporary petty profits and act as accomplices for tigers, leaving endless shame for their descendants? ㊁ The people rely on the state for protection. Since they have the happiness of co-existence and co-prosperity, they should do their best to be loyal and sincerely love the state. If they are ignorant of the great righteousness and confused by petty profits, and willingly become traitors, try asking what will happen if the country is destroyed and the family perishes? Even the ancestral tombs cannot be protected. How can they stand in the world? ㊂ Enemy planes often use traitors to send out signals during night raids. This matter is especially cruel, because when bombs are dropped, people are caught off guard and cannot avoid them. Then the traitors themselves will be crushed to pieces. ㊃ Criminal acts are not allowed by law. However, in light of human nature, there may be those who slightly overlook their traces and forgive their hearts. Only those who willingly act as traitors are said to be killed by the people of the country. The ancestors for three generations are cursed for thousands of years, and their shameful reputation cannot be washed away. What could be more shameful? The above four points are extremely clear. Even the most foolish people can easily do it. If there are shameless people who have strayed into the wrong path and can repent after this persuasion, the government will be magnanimous and will not blame the past and will give them a new life. If they still do not listen to persuasion, then they are stubbornly ignorant and isolated from the people of the country. The national law is in place and will kill without pardon.</p>
<h3>Major Espionage Ring Uncovered in Quanzhou</h3>
<p>Named "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association"; Possesses a "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Army" Structure</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The Quanzhou garrison's division and brigade recently uncovered a large-scale espionage organization in southern Fujian called the "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association." Starting from August 12th, they successively arrested the top ringleader Wu Weixuan, along with key figures such as Lin Maoqi, Liu Wei歪, Lu Jingyuan, Lin Qingjiang, Liu Houshi, Xin Xiaocun, and others, as well as monks Hu Seng, Liao Gongtao, Xu Huilu, Yuyuan, and others. Another espionage organization was also uncovered, and its ringleader Cui Yuqing and over twenty related accomplices were arrested. After interrogation, Wu Weixuan, Lin Maoqi, Liu Wei歪, and Cui Yuqing were sentenced to death on the 20th and immediately executed, while Lu Jingyuan, Zheng Houshi, Lin Qingjiang, Xin Xiaocun, and over twenty others were bound and brought to witness the executions before being returned to prison to await further investigation. It was discovered that Wu hailed from Wu Village in Huian County. He had studied at a private school and attended an agricultural school before serving as an aide to He Jia, the leader of the local militia, and later as a teacher in Oucuo Village. Last year, he was bought off by a certain party and appointed as the chief espionage leader in southern Fujian, recruiting party members from various counties under Quanzhou's jurisdiction. He and Lin Qingjiang, Lin Maoqi, Liu Wei歪, and others organized the so-called "Quanzhou Branch of the Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Fraternal Association" in Quanzhou. The branch headquarters was located in Lawyer Lu Jingyuan's law office in Zhenfu Lane. The Huian branch was located in Lu's Xianan County office. The general headquarters was in Xiamen, overseen by a certain foreigner. The branches in the various counties under Quanzhou were all under Wu's command, with Liu Wei歪 in charge of finance and Lin Qingjiang and Lin Maoqi as key members. Liu and Lin Qingjiang were originally merchants, while Lin Maoqi was a doctor. Their espionage activities were detected by the brigade headquarters last winter, which dispatched personnel to infiltrate their organization. After seven months, they uncovered its secrets and obtained important documents and confidential letters, providing ample evidence. On the night of August 12th, Lu Jingyuan, Xin Xiaocun, Xu Huilu, Liu Wei歪, Liu Houshi, and Yuyuan were arrested in Quanzhou, and Hu Seng, the director of the Jingjiang Fourth District Economic Minute Office, and Liao Gongsou, the former dispatcher of the First District, were detained. At 5:00 AM on the 13th, a team was dispatched to Huian to arrest Wu. Wu, upon hearing the news, had already fled, so they took Lu to Wu's home in Sanwu Village overnight and finally captured Wu and brought him back to Quanzhou. Wu initially tried to be evasive, but when the seized documents and confidential letters were presented, he finally confessed. He then claimed that even heinous bandits could reform, but there was no way to atone for being a traitor, and that he would only wait to be executed at the Nan Jiao Chang (South Training Ground), which was Quanzhou's execution ground. After Wu was imprisoned in the detention center, all the prisoners cursed him as a traitor. Wu, feeling remorse, begged to be placed in solitary confinement. It was then that he revealed the inner workings of the fake organization and its activities, as well as the espionage agents he had recruited, confessing everything. He even personally wrote a confession that matched the seized documents and confidential letters perfectly. Wu also stated that a certain person from Xiamen had once sent over 400 rounds of ammunition and 200-300 military blankets, which were transported to Quanzhou by sailing ship. When passing Xiutu, they were loaded into kerosene barrels and carried to Badu to resupply Wu Hu (a notorious bandit), who was in charge of military affairs, under the name "Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Army XXX Team." As for Cui Yuqing, he was from Beiyang and had served as the chief detective in Quanzhou, as well as the leader of the scattered soldiers from other provinces in Quanzhou City who cut queues (braided hairstyles). He was bought off by the enemy to carry out sabotage and riot activities. Evidence was also seized, but the time for its public announcement had not yet arrived. Cui and Wu were from different systems. Wu's was a "static" organization, while Cui's was a "dynamic" one. Wang Bo, the father and a judicial officer in Nanjing County, was originally a lawyer in Quanzhou. Due to his relationship with the Wu case, he was also arrested by the garrison and brought to Quanzhou for questioning. The organizational rules of the so-called anti-communist army under Wu's command are transcribed below:</p>

<h3>All Sectors Exerting Efforts to Solicit National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Communications Sector Continuously Raises Substantial Funds; Overseas Chinese Remit One Million Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>The General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds was formally established. Since the start of the solicitation, compatriots at home and abroad have enthusiastically donated and purchased bonds. In addition to the Bank of Communications subscribing six million yuan itself, it has continuously raised substantial funds in recent days. Yesterday, the bank received a total of 550,000 yuan, including 500,000 yuan from the Pacific Insurance Company, 10,000 yuan from Zhu Bingji, 15,000 yuan from Lu Yanji, and 25,000 yuan from He Lingji. Furthermore, the General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds received remittances totaling one million yuan from overseas Chinese for the purchase of National Salvation Bonds yesterday. The solicitation work is still ongoing, and it is expected that funds will soon be allocated to fully subscribe and increase the strength of resistance and salvation. Details of various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Huang Jie Leads Troops in Subscription</p>
<p>President Song of the General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds received a telegram from General Huang Jie yesterday, stating that the officers and soldiers of his department have already begun resisting the invasion and defending themselves. In addition to being prepared for battle, they have specifically subscribed to 13,000 yuan of National Salvation Bonds, remitted to the Bank of China in Nanjing for transfer, in order to contribute their modest efforts. It is heard that President Song has telegraphed General Huang in return, deeply commending the spirit of the officers and soldiers of his department for both risking their lives and contributing money.</p>
<p>Native Place Associations Form Solicitation Squads</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens Solicitation Corps for National Salvation Bonds, various squads were organized separately in order to conduct widespread solicitation. All native place associations in Shanghai have also resolved that each native place association should establish a squad. As of recently, a quarter of the squads have reported their establishment. In order to urge the early establishment of each squad, the association has specifically announced to each native place association that they must establish a squad as quickly as possible before the 11th of this month, and report the name of the squad leader to the association, so that it can be compiled and requested from the General Committee for Soliciting National Salvation Bonds for appointment, and begin solicitation.</p>
<p>Broadcast and Entertainment - Special Program</p>
<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Association and the Shanghai Entertainment Association have jointly solicited National Salvation Bonds, and have scheduled a special program to be held from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day starting on the 12th, which will be broadcast by radio stations throughout the city. Starting on the 18th, famous performers will be invited to broadcast and sing national salvation operas. It is heard that the program has been scheduled and will be announced on the 10th.</p>
<h3>The Gas Company Should Not Hastily Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Opinions of Support Leaders</p>
<p>The issue of the resumption of operations by the gas company in the concessions has attracted considerable attention and concern from residents both Chinese and foreign. Furthermore, the self-ignition of a gas pipe the other day, which injured pedestrians, although it did not lead to a major disaster, makes it difficult to avoid the recurrence of major tragedies at this time of flying bullets. In order to understand the truth of this issue, the reporter specifically visited responsible persons from various anti-enemy support associations. According to them, gas itself has a strong toxic quality. If the underground gas pipes are destroyed by bombs, the gas will leak, and nearby residents may be poisoned to death. Furthermore, the combustibility of gas is very strong. If the gas pipes are broken by stray bullets, nearby houses will be immediately burned. Moreover, the explosive force of gas is extremely strong. If the coal storage furnace is hit by artillery shells, the tragedy of a major explosion will inevitably be expanded. It is hoped that the company authorities will consider the safety of millions of citizens and not hastily resume operations. It is further hoped that for the sake of their own safety, they will use it less for the time being.</p>
