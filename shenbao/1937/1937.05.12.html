<p>時評</p>
<h3>慶祝英王加冕</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>英王喬治六世今日在威明斯脫宮舉行加冕禮。這次典禮的盛大遠超過於以前數次。單就加冕費一項來說。就達五十二萬四千鎊之多。（約合華幣八百餘萬元）。在這盛大的節日。不但不列顚帝國統治下的四萬五千萬人民狂歡不已。就是其他各國的人民也一致表示慶賀。</p>
<p>中英兩國的邦交向來非常友善。尤其在最近二三年中。兩國的關係更為密切。所以在這次加冕典禮時。我國政府特派財政部長孔祥熙•海軍部長陳紹寬•與駐英大使郭泰祺為參加典禮特使。率領外交財政軍事專家多人前往倫敦致賀。郭大使更於五日招待孔特使與英政府要人的宴會上。申明中國人民慶賀之意。郭大使說。“去歲倫敦舉行中國美術展覽會時。凡屬中華人士。莫不自以為華人而自慶自傲。惟今日則反是。因今日倫敦之中國人士。幾自疑其非華人而為英人。蓋亦深覺英國新王新后之可愛戴。不知不覺遂與英人及普世界之人同心慶忭故也。”</p>
<p>我國人民對於英王加冕表示這樣的歡忭。固不僅僅因為“新王新后之可愛戴。”主要的還是由於中英邦交的友善。在過去數年間。中英關係的確比以前增進。尤其是在幣制改革與經濟建設方面。英國政府的帮忙很大。這次我國代表團在倫敦。備受英國官方與民間的歡迎。我們極希望在這慶祝歡宴之外。能夠產生政治上的收獲。使兩國在太平洋上的合作有更進一步的發展。</p>
<p>最近太平洋上的形勢。簡要的說。是日本厲行大陸政策。不斷的向中國進攻。日本佔領東北之不足。又復向華北及中國中南部發展。政治的軍事的侵略之後。繼之以經濟的侵略。這種侵略的結果。不但使中國領土主權大受損害。就是英國在遠東的利益也遭遇很大的打擊。英國在數年前雖想同日本謀取妥協的途徑。以保全其在華的利益。但是在碰了幾次釘子以後。英國已不再向東京求出路了。因此中英的關係就漸漸密切起來。可是在最近一個月中。日本因為想打開國際孤立的局面。已向英國提出對華合作的辦法。據云英國方面業已準備作具體的討論。這種對華合作辦法。多半會含有劃分勢力範圍的意義。要是英國不顧遠東的實際形勢。而與日本作“劃分勢力範圍”的討論。則結果不但會大上日本的當。而且也必遭遇全中國人民的反對。聰明的英國人想不至於做這樣的笨事。我們對於艾登外相於五日在下院中的聲明。“英政府不欲建議在華勢力範圍的復活。”當然深信不疑。不過因為“英日對華合作”問題對於我國的利害關係實在太大。所以乘這慶賀英王加冕的機會。表明中國人民的立塲與態度。</p>

<p>其次為宣誓、由大主敎垂詢新王曰、“爾願莊嚴允諾並宣誓依據各該法律習慣、治理大不列顚•愛爾蘭•加拿大•澳大利亞•紐西蘭•南非聯邦•以及一切所有地領土與印度帝國之人民否”、王答、“余敬謹允諾、依此實行、大主敎復問曰、“爾願以爾之權、使法律及正義在慈悲之中、暢行於爾一切裁判之中否”、王答“余願之”、大主敎復問、“爾願盡爾之力、保持法律所規定之基督新敎、使確立於聯合王國否”、以及其他關於敎會特權利益等問題、均由王答以“余謹允諾、依此實行”、新王於是行到神壇之前、免冠下跪、以右手撫於聖經而宣誓曰、“余適所已允諾之、一切、余謹願遵行勿渝、求上帝佑余”、言畢以唇吻經、誓成、</p>
<p>於是聖餐禮開始、其節目以祈禱開始、繼之以使徒書及福音之朗誦、至齊唱聖靈降臨之歌、背誦信條等、此時歌詩隊復唱“列王紀”第一章之聖歌、在此時王已卸去身上之紅袍、免其御冠、徐行至壇前、安坐於愛德華王之椅中、由高貴爵士四人張金布之幕於其頂、大主敎然後以十字架式以聖油注於王之兩掌前胸及首頂、次由威司敏斯特主敎於祈禱完畢後、至神壇取踢馬刺一副、授之御前大臣、御前大臣卽以之觸王之足跟、然後返之神壇之上、</p>
<p>此時王卽佩“王者之劍”、大主敎呼曰、“其以此劍行正義、止不公、保護上帝之聖敎會扶孤寡、凡腐朽者恢復之、旣恢復者保持之、過誤者懲處之改善之、善良者確定之………”</p>
<p>至是王置劍於神壇、復坐愛德華王椅中、首先受劍之貴族乃出金一百先令、將劍贖回、而將劍㧞之出鞘、立新王前、至禮終始退王於是披繡花禮袍、侍臣乃以金球獻王、而置之神壇上、次大主敎以戒指加於王之右手、四指、於是王乃受御笏、大主敎降自神壇、取威司敏斯特主敎所捧之王冕加諸王首、</p>
<p>上舉禮節進行時、堂內觀者咸肅靜無聲、迨王旣加冕、衆乃高呼“上帝其佑吾王”、而喇叭復齊鳴、於是諸貴族亦各於歌聖詩聲中加禮冠於首、加冠畢、王乃升寶座、大主敎格洛塞斯特公爵王族餘人公侯伯子男爵領班、各依次跑新王前、觸王冕、吻王左頰、以示効忠、此禮需時約十五分鐘、同時、歌効忠詩六章、次各主敎與其他貴族各就其班次行効忠禮、禮畢、鼓聲大作、喇叭齊嗚、堂內羣衆大呼“上帝其佑吾王喬治”、“吾王喬治萬歲”“吾王其萬壽無疆”、</p>
<p>次王后行膏沐加冕禮、其禮節略與王同、而遠不若王之繁縟、王后欵步過端坐寶座之王前時、向王行一鞠躬禮、而就自己之寶座、於是風琴大鳴、樂隊依特製之樂調唱聖詩、王與其后同自寶座起步至神壇階上、免冠下跪、行獻祭禮、並舉行聖餐之第二節王與后共受聖體、由大主敎加以祝福後、并依特製之樂調唱聖詩、於是新王放下一切御用品、步入聖愛德華敎堂中、解去王　而易以紫色絲絨長袍、王及后乃由所入之路由、經聖詩班步行至西門、王右手持上綴十字架之御笏、左手捧金球、王后亦右手執笏、惟左手則持上綴一鳩之象牙杖、王及后俱戴冕、（中央社十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>英王小史與其家庭（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>王之關心兒童幸福、出自天性、某日倫敦有頑童二、叩閽求見曰、“兒等向在某處荒地片隅聚嬉、今其地興工建屋矣、試問兒等今後將在何地聚嬉乎”王曰、“少安毋躁、容余為汝等謀之、”於是王發電話、請倫敦市政當局為羣兒另闢遊樂之地、不祟朝而王告羣兒日、“某地可供汝等今後遊樂矣、”此事嘗為倫敦人士嘖嘖稱道、而成市井美談、故王喬治五世之舉行御極二十五年紀念也、王於慶祝程序中關於增進男女靑年幸福諸事、尤感興趣、贊助不遺餘力、某日王主席於亞爾倍堂大會、受童子軍之祝頌、童子軍戲銀杖一事、由兒童約二千人晝夜相傳遞、經二千三百哩、而始達於倫敦會塲焉、此杖與柯林胡特號巡洋艦官兵所贈當日該艦作戰時所縣之軍旗、王皆鄭重保藏、視為殊榮、</p>
<p>一九二〇年之夏、王晋封為約克公爵、閱三年、經雙親之允可、與斯特拉摩男爵之女公子伊麗莎伯女土訂婚、聞厥初女士與雙方父母對於此舉、猶預頗久、然此不外乎試騐靑年情意之誠摯而已、故一九二三年四月、王與今后結婚於威斯敏斯特大禮拜堂、舉國歡騰、目為佳耦、當新孃步上中堂時、曾止於無名英雄墓前、以懷擁之白玫瑰花一束、謹置墓上、其意必以為無名英雄乃代表陣亡法國之乃兄也、禮成、新夫婦驅車經過白堂歡呼之人羣時、復在陣亡戰士紀念碑前徘徊片刻、此二事在約克公爵夫婦、不過偶爾出之、然在民衆皆深為感動矣、聞新夫婦當日離白金漢宮外適作蜜月旅行時、威爾斯親王（皇太子）伸手入車、與其弟婦作別曰、“好自珍重、夫人乃未來之英后、”不意此言今竟實踐也、</p>
<p>伊麗莎伯女士以一九〇〇年八月四日生於哈福邑、為斯特拉摩伯爵唯一之女、昆仲共十人、當歐戰發生時、諸兄除一年尚幼稚者外、餘悉從戎、其一名費古斯者陣亡法境、軍興未久、伯爵之格萊米斯古堡改設軍醫院、收容養兵、女士年甫十四、而已能助乃母治理院務、睱則照料在役軍人之妻孥、且為前綫戰士編製短襪、絕不類養尊處優之貴族令媛、女士幼由慈母督責、攻讀家庭中、而戰爭之影響復足為敎育之助、蓋當時人皆具有愛護同胞、為國服務之精神、女士秉性純篤、流風所及、故乃如成人之盡責也、女士吉期將屆、其故鄉安古斯之居民、謀醵資購贈奩品、女士以當時衆方受實業不景氣之影響、不欲因是累鄉人、力予謝絕、某次希菲爾特利器工人舉行年宴、邀約克公爵參加、而新王亦以民生艱苦、失業者纍纍、宜以有用之金錢、賙卹貧乏、毅然辭謝、足徵新王與后同具愛恤同類之慈懷也、</p>
<p>曼麗公主之結婚也、女士為其儐相之一、而於舉行晨婚宴時、曾與王子亞爾倍（新王之名）駢肩而坐、時女士年方六歲、新王年十一、兩小無猜、嘗相嬉遊、未幾分袂、暌隔十五載、至歐戰終止之次年、始復聚會、維時女士已亭亭玉立、昳麗出衆、而其嫣然一笑、尤足感人、數年前倫敦大主敎嘗讚約克公爵夫人之笑貌曰、“約克公爵夫人之微笑、乃大不列顚帝國之佳兆也”、蓋其作笑、純出自然、充滿眞誠、毫無虛飾、當之者足以消愁忘憂、胸襟愉快也、加以女士秉乃母遺傳之性、好文學、擅跳舞、精網球、策騎行獵、猶其餘事、新王以女士與之好尚相同、愛之綦甚、嘗向求婚兩次而遭拒絕、一日同騎馳騁郊外、新王復申前請、女士竟予允諾、於是有情人終成眷屬矣、新王結婚之後、夫婦同游於北愛爾蘭、繼復行獵於東非、飽載而歸、一九二七年澳洲議會新厦落成、新王奉父王之命、往行開幕禮、新王有口吃病、屢治未愈、故甚以行禮時當衆致詞、將露其短為慮、但新王意志堅决、事前練習發音、寢饋不忘辛苦數月、沉痼若失、屆日在康白拉新議會羣衆之前、滔滔發言亳無滯鈍、有志竟成、洵不誣也、是行秉“名譽”號巡洋艦先至哲美加、繼經巴拿馬運河渡太平洋、遊馬克斯羣島與菲基島、而於二月二十二日抵紐絲倫、五月九日行禮於康白拉、所至受衆歡迎、以七月返京、新后亦隨行焉、</p>
<p>新王居國內時、所任諸務不勝殫紀、而其中多為儲君應盡職責、如兩次赴比、一出席國際展覽會開幕禮、一代表王族參加比后殯禮、皆皇太子所宜為者也、喬治五世薨後、王族停止社會活動數月、新王乃乘此閒暇、巡視各工區、去冬乃兄愛德華八世、因圖與辛浦森夫人結婚、格於憲法、為大臣所尼、乃下詔遜位、嗣由王室與大臣共决、以約克公爵繼位、五月十二日、原為愛德華之加冕期、新王為饜國人之願望起見、仍以是日與其后行加冕禮於威司敏斯特大禮拜堂、觀於全國慶祝之盛况、可知國人愛戴之熱烈矣、</p>
<p>自歐戰終止後、新王常須參與禮式事務此甚為其所厭為者、新王居恒喜與其父母共叙天倫之樂、其最愉快之時間、厥為與其后曁二女盤恒、或率羣犬、携影片攝製機、散步園中、一日有電影公司請新王許其攝其眷屬之影、新王答曰、無勞出此、余已自為之矣、新王遇事不求速達、每一問題至、輒窮加研究而不辭勞瘁、必俟其貫澈明瞭而後已、新王行事力戒茍且、對於敷衍一時而不得要領之解釋尤所不滿、每行一事如乃父然、必求其所安、事無論巨細、旣諾之後、必盡力之所能以為之、此亦秉乃父之遺風、新王意志堅强、亦為遺傳性之一、然從諫如流、對於堪予信任之人信之弗疑、新王登極之後、仍不改其常度、猶憶新王所度之第一耶誕節、與其眷屬靜處桑特林漢晨赴敎堂、下午分散贈品與諸兒童、假期餘數日、則與至交結伴行獵、不失英國之古風、說者謂此足為英國新朝之吉兆云、新王老友格萊格爵士數年前嘗曰、“約克公爵為人、非閃爍罔定者、國人或未明瞭其性格之力量、但終有一日、渠能如乃父之受衆愛慕也、”寥寥數言、堪為新王品性之輪廓焉、</p>
<p>新后自幼熱心公益、旣為約克公爵夫人、乃益奮勉、其所担任之社會職務、為類綦繁、至其居家庭中、晨輒為二女備餐品、午後與二女同嬉、晚則與新王同坐爐邊、或讀書報、或奏鋼琴、堪當賢母良妻之稱、第為后之後、身為國母、負責之重與前自不可同日語矣、其二女一名伊麗莎白、年甫十一、一名羅斯年未滿七、伊麗莎白貌類其父、自幼所受之訓練、卽為將來或有一日、統御帝國計、今則果為儲君矣、職是之故、乃禮聘敎員、授敎家庭、而未使入校、每晨九時三十分上課、至正午止、午後則輒駕車出遊、聰慧活潑、而為民衆所愛、其妹甫就讀、據敎師言、進步良佳云、</p>
<p>新王之母后曼麗今猶健在、其為人性慈善、而富於責任心、平日以蒐集美術品與園藝為消遣、新王新年所頒之詔書述及其所承繼之責任曰、“朕以信任之心擔負此種責任、蓋知王后曁母后在朕之側為助也、”於此足徵新王對其老母之尊尚與孝思已、新王弟二、一為格洛塞斯特公爵、一坎特公爵、皆具長才、足為君輔、乃兄遜王愛德華八世、今為溫德莎公爵、則已定期與辛浦森夫人結褵法國、以遂其素願矣、（完）</p>
<h3>倫敦外交接洽</h3>
<p>艾登延見各國代表忙　與捷奧商談中歐問題</p>
<p>［倫敦］艾登外相今晨接見蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫舉行談話、歷時甚長、繼並接見奧外長史密德•立陶宛外長羅士雷蒂斯、至於德國國防部長白倫堡上將、則將於本日午後訪晤艾登外相、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］捷克總理霍德柴、奧國外長史密特、代表各該國政府前來此間、參加國王加冕典禮、於本日聯袂訪謁外相艾登、當就中歐洲問題有所商談、聞兩人曾向艾登堅稱、英法兩國必需在中歐洲作切實之行動、否則中歐洲各小國、將受羅馬柏林政治軸心之誘引、而處於柏林卵翼之下、結果所屆、德國或將遂其稱覇中歐之初圖、亦未可知、此在奧國外長史密特則尤堅持奧國志在獨立、不願加入任何國際集團、同時並深願與多瑙河流域各隣國實行合作云、此外並聞捷克總理霍德柴提出多瑙河流域各國經濟合作之具體計畫、此項計畫、當從捷克•羅馬尼亞•奧地利•匈牙利•四國經濟合作入手、其次則保加利亞與南斯拉夫、亦可參加、最後復使德國與意大利、亦加入經濟合作、一般人以為南斯拉夫最近甫與意大利訂立政治經濟協定、故加入此種合作較為困難、但霍德柴今晚赴白金漢宮宴會時、乘便與南斯拉夫第一攝政保祿親王、舉行談話、或可為南斯拉夫加入多瑙河合作計畫之一事預作準備也、一般人又以為霍德柴所提計畫目的、僅在於多瑙河流域各國之經濟合作、此項合作事業、可為將來訂結政治協定之一種準備、至就目前環境、欲使多瑙河各國訂結互不干涉內政之協定、殊屬不易辦到、故不得不緩圖之耳、（中央社十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英王加冕聲中工潮形勢嚴重</h3>
<p>倫敦運輸業决繼續罷工　煤礦勞資爭端談判破裂</p>
<p>［倫敦］今晚公共汽車工人會議與礦工會議之結果、已使英倫工界氣象為之黯淡、公共汽車工人集議畢、運輸業工人聯合會之總幹事貝文宣稱、工人大多數拒絕倫敦運輸局之建議、决議繼續罷工、彼等第二步驟、將為以罷工擴至他業問題、提交幹事會核奪、據現象觀之、工潮非一時所能平息、電車與街車工人一萬二千名且有加入罷工之虞、按公共汽車工人要求每日工作七時半、調查法庭之臨時報告對此未予贊同、</p>
<p>同時礦務大臣克羅尚克調解哈威資之煤礦爭端已告失敗、諾丁漢煤礦主人與當地所謂斯賓塞工會已拒絕與礦工聯合會作無條件的會議、故礦工聯合會决於星期六日發出通告、定五月二十九日開始罷工、惟礦務部在此日期前、將再努力告成三方面之無條件的會議也、（中央社十日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］倫敦公共汽車之工潮、與諾丁漢礦業之爭執官塲雖竭力調處、冀於加冕日以前解决之、然迄今仍未有解决希望、倫敦運輸局最近所提出之建議卽該局對於汽車業工人所陳訴各點除每日工時七小時半外、願加以討論、如未能成立直接妥協、則願將各點提交調查法庭者、已為汽車夫多數所拒絕、而礦務大臣羅尚克擬調節哈威資煤礦爭端之努力、亦復未有結果、惟汽車工潮之擴大、一時不致實現雖電車街車工人一萬二千名、現望運輸工會准其加入罷工、然工會幹事决不致承認此種運動、衆料幹事將勸令電車工人照常工作、至於地底火車之僱員、則隸屬於全國路員工會、及機車夫司機人與司火夫工會、而非運輸工會之會員、全國路員工會秘書、今日聲稱、目前未有牽涉地底火車僱員之問題云、（中央社十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］倫敦區公共汽車工潮殆將曠日持久、而在國王加冕典禮期間勢必成為僵局、而無法解决、官塲方面對於此層極為憂慮、特力事掩飾不令曝露於外、一般觀察家現感覺公共汽車工潮與煤礦業工潮、均在舉行加冕典禮之一星期內發生、並非偶然之事、而似係極端派機關之所發縱指使、蓋極端派雖使工人相信、此次罷工純係職業的動機、實則暗中仍具有政治作用、當局有鑒於此、乃採取極端溫和態度、務勿激怒罷工者、卽如一九二六年英國全國舉行總罷工時、曾有私營公司用載貨汽車辦理公衆運輸事宜、此次公共汽車罷工者則曾宣布、倘有此種情事發生、决非彼等所能容忍云云、以故上星期中雖有若干私營公司企圖活動、但均為官廳方面所勸阻、而未成事實、此乃官廳採取溫和態度之明證、大抵在慶祝加冕期內、官廳仍將維持此種態度、特罷工運動若果蔓延、則當局或將出而積極干涉耳、（中央社十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日荷貿易協定將成立以犧牲我國為條件</h3>
<p>日購荷糖以台糖傾銷中國作妥協　限制華貨輸荷印為日方唯一目的</p>
<p>神州社云、自桑島氏代表日本政府南行赴荷印後、日荷間訂立貿易協定之說、卽流傳各國、且有卽於日內簽訂公佈之趨勢、據各方傳聞、該項協定唯一中心、厥為排斥華貨問題、神州社記者、以此事關係重大、特向各方面探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>荷印對我向居出超</p>
<p>查荷印對我貿易、歷年均居出超地位、且雙方數字相差、輒在十倍至十五倍之間、荷印輸入我國者、每年輒在荷幣一千萬盾上下、多時且逾三千萬盾、而國貨輸入荷印者、年僅二百萬盾左右、去年雖打破紀錄、然亦僅五百九十九萬一千盾、較荷印之二千三百十九萬六千盾、相差仍達四倍之鉅、是以中國實為荷印最好之市塲、良無疑義、我輸入荷印貨物、為布疋•食品•雜貨•磁器•毛織品•文具•圖書•罐頭•漆料•等、荷印輸入我國者、幾全為砂糖與石油、</p>
<p>荷印對日居於入超</p>
<p>然荷印對日貿易、則一反面為入超、最近四年來、日貨在荷印市塲突飛猛進、一日千里、一九三一年總值尚僅六三•四五〇元、至前年已高升至一五八•四五〇元、而荷印輸入日本者、自一九二九年後、逐年下落、唯一原因、荷印外銷全恃砂糖、但日本培植台灣糖成功後、不特無須採購荷糖、且更利用走私等方法、壓倒荷糖在華勢力、過去荷印為反抗計、曾採用比例制度、限制日貨輸入、收效甚微、近二年來因日本準備大戰、盡量購藏油類、荷產石油得大量輸入日本、表而始漸告好轉、</p>
<p>籌訂協定排斥我國</p>
<p>荷印產糖旣被台灣排斥、現唯以有關軍用之糖•油•汽油•鐵•樹膠、為輸入日本至要貨物、日本輸入荷印者、以棉織物及人造絲為大宗、其次則為五舍製造品•陶磁器•玻璃用具•等、但日本總以荷印所頒布辦法、有礙日貨銷路、務期達到不妨礙日貨南洋市塲目的、經多時籌劃乃决定與荷印訂立貿易協定、其所取方法、卽為日本購用荷印產糖、而以台灣糖全部傾銷中國、並在擴大日貨在荷印市塲、限制我國貨物入口、桑島南行所持妥協條件、卽為犧牲中國、以獲得日荷雙方合作條件、實則荷糖在華市塲極鉅、如經台灣糖傾銷後、雖在日本獲得市塲、其原有在華市塲、必被排斥無疑、故日荷貿易協定訂立後、我受損失、荷印亦無所得、而日本則坐受其利、現荷印百餘萬華僑以此項協定、將摧殘僑商及國內工商業、紛紛向國內建議、請求當局進行與荷印重新訂定貿易協定、以期補救云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“以留聲機取供”</h3>
<p>— 洪法</p>
<p>許多器具的發明，在最初，大概都源於事實的需要吧！久而久之，應用起來，就會超出那種純有益的界限，而給人類作為享樂游戲之用的。例如飛機的製造，其目的是在於供給軍用，但時間一久，人類就會想到利用牠作天空游覽：無綫電的發明，為遠距離交通的利器，而人類亦可利用之以收音取樂……等是。</p>
<p>至於留聲機這東西，不知在外國作何用途？其在我國，則自從輸入以來，就是作為消遣的工具，於茶餘酒後，開唱片取樂的。想不到現在却有人來利用牠作為訴訟舉證之用。</p>
<p>據報載：“高三分院民庭推事樊培恩，於本月七日下午四時許，在該院第三法庭審理吳鴻達等與吳鴻德等為返還地價上訴一案，上訴人用灌音方法，將被上訴人在外口述朦蔽法院之情形，製成唱片呈庭，樊推事當庭開留聲機，果播出案情真相”云。</p>
<p>這事情看似平常，伊因為有這一舉，不但當事者的敗訴，可以因為新證的成立，獲得最後勝利。而尤可注意的是牠給與社會上影響的重大。今日以後，人與人之間，如果有相互不睦，或暗地憎恨等情事，則不論其對手之為任何方，皆會慄慄危懼，在交談之間，出言至為囁囁吞吐，或者簡直可以沉默不語，而其所以然的原故，就因為偶一不愼，懷疑到和他說話的對手，可以在暗地裹將所談的一切，灌音保留起來的。這樣做的結果，卽使不必為將來發生訴訟檢證之用，而言行如稍有參差的話，也就不免給人以前後矛盾之誚了。</p>
<p>不是嗎？過去有些名小說家，因其作品中人物的刻畫，極為生動逼真，於是就有許多人，生怕被寫進他的作品中去，留下了一個污點，就有意的和他避不見面。由此例彼，則上面我那樣的過慮，也許會成為眞的事實的。</p>
<p>至於自己的私見：却還想將這種發明，應用到更廣泛的範圍上去，不但平民可以利用取供，就是有些政治家，當他在野時候，向人民發表些救國的高論，——因為這也是“供”，—我們就將他用灌音方法留下來，待其將來重上政治舞台時，就看他的舉措和設施，和向日發表的言論，是否適相符合？或者完全矛盾？而來决定我們對於他的信仰的從違。因為他的“供辭”，在事實上，也是有人“聽審”的。那就是無數億萬的民衆。這樣做，不但是“用留聲機取供”之更高度的應用，那效果，也就更為宏遠了。</p>
<h3>看熱鬧</h3>
<p>— 蕪村</p>
<p>時維五月，歲次丁丑，上海跑馬廳舉行英皇喬治六世加冕典禮。因為怕參加的人太多，預售座券，以示限制，券價分五元二元一元，等數種。據報上說，全部座位五萬餘，事先早已售罄：沿跑馬廳的國際，新世界……等旅館房間，亦在二星期以前定售一空。</p>
<p>什麼人這麼熱心呢？報紙上沒有說起。可是我們不妨預測一下：加冕的雖是英皇，典禮也遠在英倫，但到跑馬廳參觀儀式的，定旅館瞭望儀式的，至少有三分之二，是我們的黃帝子孫。</p>
<p>中國的蟻民，大抵都在殷殷望治，希望自己不再被“攘”和被“安”，太太平平的吃一口苦飯。而中國的閑人，却愁沒有熱鬧可看。</p>
<p>人家出喪，他們看；人家迎親，他們看，呆呆地在街上站上個把鐘頭，一邊看，一邊還要加以讚嘆，加以批評。馬路上巡捕打黃包車夫，看熱鬧的照例圍着一大羣，失魂落魄似地，彷彿賞鑑什麼藝術品，被打的一狼狽，他們就覺得有趣，在旁邊嘻嘻的笑。</p>
<p>汽車撞壞了小孩，也一樣若無其事地看。等到西捕的棍子挨到身上，並且聽得連推連喝的斥道“去，去，去！看哈末事！”這纔猛然從夢裹驚醒似的，搔搔頭皮，悻悻然跑了開去，再去看旁的熱鬧。自己挨棍子，是從來不反抗的，因為一反抗，就難免起衝突，自己就要被困垓心，讓人家來看熱鬧了。</p>
<p>槍斃一個綁票，總是觀者數萬，途為之塞，隣村失火，哭聲震天，而觀者大樂。</p>
<p>倘使有錢，對於熱鬧的賞鑑慾也就更强更廣。化錢的，不化錢的，凡有熱鬧，一律參加，但均以自己不會沾惹着什麼麻煩為限。倘使有些不穩，趕緊跑回家去，戰戰兢兢的關上大門，躱起來。等危險過了，他再出來旁觀作樂。</p>
<p>豫西旱災嚴重，難民數萬，輾轉待斃。除了那些以“慈善”為“事業”的紳士，誰有自動捐募一點的嗎？參觀洋鬼子的慶祝儀式，却早已座券賣光，旅館房間定售一空了。但倘使豫西的災區，可以搬到上海x世界來，公開展覽，任人參觀，則銷售門票，大抵也不成問題，愛看熱鬧的人，是不問喜慶與喪弔的。看看別人的災難，在他們也是一種娛樂，諺有之，曰：“隔岸觀火。”</p>
<p>而有時簡直連自己家裹的火也看。聽說瀋陽失陷，日本軍隊在街上游行示威的時候，也還有閑人（自然是中國的）張着口佇立參觀，第二天的日本報上說是“皇軍過處，迎者夾道，盛稱帝國軍容之盛”云。</p>
<p>然而座券旅館都完了，怎麼辦呢？—到馬路上“軋軋鬧猛”也好。擁擁擠擠，衝衝撞撞的大半夜，弄得滿頭大汗，然後莫明其妙的回到家裹，對老婆說道：“英國皇帝登基，人山人海，小孩和女人軋壞了好幾個，眞正好白相得來”</p>
<h3>“興登堡”飛船失事</h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>往來於大西洋上空之德國大飛船“興登堡”號，於本月六日在途中突然炸裂，旋卽起火焚燒，乘客一百人中，截止今日電告，已有五十人死於非命了！據美國半官界宣佈其肇事原因為不用氦氣而用氫氣（按：氫氣易燃燒，氦氣則否）此次爆炸，當係氫氣爆炸。當此船於去年五月第一次飛渡大西洋時，前船長愛克勒博士，卽主張購用氦氣以避危險。當時美國方面原擬充份為之供給，旋因德國政府禁止現欵出口，未能償付貨價而罷。（查全世界天然氦氣出產地僅有合衆國與加拿大兩國），他處雖設有工廠提鍊氦氣，但成本甚昂。故“興登堡”以氫代氦，終至此次爆炸。</p>
<p>“興登堡”於去年五月舉行處女航，至去年十月間已完成其一九三六年航期了。當她於春間開航之初，齊柏林公司聲稱要在規定時間之內，完成十次往來</p>

<h3>賽金花</h3>
<p>— 陳禾製</p>
<p>十八</p>
<p>賽金花到了，北京四處又使賽金花的心上，受到一個重大的侵襲，她所要投奔的親戚朋友，有的被淸庭指爲通夷，而被殺了；有的逃難到遠處去了，竟使她撲了個空。賽金花正在，進退爲難的時候，幸而到處都有慈悲心腸的人，在人叢中走出一位老者，竟慷慨地招呼到，他家去安身</p>
<p>於大西洋上歐美間的航程，各方面對於這一點見解各有不同。一部份人對此表示坦白的懷疑，因爲他們鑒於美國海軍部的各大氫氣飛艇，和英國大飛艇R一○一號等的在空中失事，不敢隨便確定她的命運。如今至今恰一年，雖已飛滿十次，但終究失事了。</p>
<p>“興登堡”號在她航期中的唯一特色，就是每次航行的日期，都與公司方面預先露佈者相符。每次航行時，船上都有駕駛高手，專門管理一切。愛克納博士，就是“興登堡”的導師，有好幾次都是他親自開航的。其次像雷門船長，波魯士船長（歐戰時齊柏林飛艇指揮官）也是氫氣飛船的老手。此次船長爲浦勒斯，前任船長萊曼亦在船中照料。</p>
<p>從德國到美國，“興登堡”的如航綫並不限於一路，因爲德國人根據他們駕駛氫氣飛船的經騐，隨着氣候的不同隨時更改他們的航綫。</p>
<p>過去的航程中，每次所需的時間，最短爲五二·八小時，最長爲七八·一小時：每次搭客少自二十一人起多至七十二人止。船中本來祇有臥鋪位五十架，後來因爲搭客過多，所以於去年八月份起增加鋪位至七十架。</p>
<p>郵件的載運，在經營者方面看起來，未免有些失望。第一次“興登堡”由歐飛美，各方面都抱着十分的好奇心，和集郵客的“初航”嗜好，郵件的裝載開了一個紀錄—二千二百六十磅。第二次由美飛歐却就减到一千八百二十磅。其後每次多少各有不同，可是没有一次能超過上述兩個紀錄。由最多的四百四十八磅起，至最少的一百六十七磅止。每一郵件重不逾半盎司的取費美金四角，因之收入仍頗可觀。</p>
<p>貨運的重量每次也儘有不同。最多的爲第二次東航程，所載計重二千五百磅；最後一次的西行航程中却少到祇有六十三磅了，貨運的花色繁多，可説應有盡有，從電影膠片起到整輛的汽車和全部的飛機止，都曾在大西洋上空中飛渡過，從客，貨，郵三方面的運輸收入算起來，經營者尚認爲有利可圖。</p>
<p>目下齊柏林公司又在建造一艘“興登堡”的姊妹船—LZ一三○計長四百尺，船壳已經搭好，據聞今年九月中可以完了，而與她的姊妹—“興登堡”每週來往美國德國之間，然而她的姊妹已夭折了，妹妹的命運不知如何？</p>
<h3>血花的街</h3>

<p>蜜蜂在謳歌你，為了你給牠們帶來了果腹的香花，葉子也在禮讚你，為了你給牠們穿上葱叢艷綠的新裝。玫瑰血一般的華麗：薔薇也黃得誘惑，像女人一瞬的秋波、一切在生长，耙壯，飽滿，笑悅。</p>
<p>人們的血管也流動着你季節的熱烈。他們要跳，要喊，要生存，也要笑悅啊！</p>
<p>人們每條神經的末梢都注滿了興奮，每個人都喊着：</p>
<p>——給我們生的食糧。</p>
<p>——給我們自由，笑悅。</p>
<p>黃豆似的汗珠在各人油黑的臉上淌下來，那期望着生的喜悅的呼聲喊出雄壯的歌曲：“那是我們的季節”。他們說</p>
<p>但是莽莽的街頭陣雨似的鞭子落下來，緊張的血管破裂了，巨人乘着馬蹄蹂躪那些在街頭追求幸福的人們。人們倒下去，分散開。呼狂，勇敢，他們把心窩的熱血洒在街頭，狂亂地上前而掙扎到最後才微笑着倒下。</p>
<p>一列一列的，歌唱着在街頭迎上雪亮的刀槍！倒下去，擁上來！</p>
<p>生命的氣息比太陽還熱烈，比怒浪還壯觀。</p>
<p>當熱悶的濕空氣飛漲上升而擁成初夏的雷雨時，大地才回復了安靜，街頭洗出斑駁的血痕，樹上也結滿纍纍的櫻桃。</p>
<p>“憂鬱的季節過去了”。孩子們在呼吸着雷雨的新鮮。</p>
<p>大地仍熱烈地在着旋動，但並不是窒息與沈重的氣氛。</p>

<h3>The Aim of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations is to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister's Statement: Claims No Disadvantage to China, Attempting to Alleviate Our Country's Concerns</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Official circles today firmly denied rumors that the United States and Japan would hold negotiations at the expense of a certain friendly nation, saying that the Anglo-Japanese talks in London will aim to adjust relations between the two countries and are not directed at a third party. (Eleventh Central News Agency Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Yesterday (the 10th), Japanese Foreign Minister Sato met with Japanese reporters and gave a speech, attempting to dispel concerns expressed by China regarding Anglo-Japanese compromises. He stated that Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Yoshida, had held talks with Sir Robert Craigie, Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in London several months ago. The outcome of these talks, namely the content of the Anglo-Japanese understanding, will be announced soon. The British Under-Secretary of State had already announced the preliminary contacts regarding Anglo-Japanese compromise in London in the House of Lords. The Chinese side seems to believe that the Anglo-Japanese talks are detrimental to them, and therefore express serious concern. However, the fact is that the Anglo-Japanese compromise is not being conducted under conditions that sacrifice China or place China at a disadvantage. Therefore, China's concerns are unnecessary. On the Japanese side, negotiations with the British government are only to adjust the conflicts of Anglo-Japanese interests in China. The results of these talks will be announced as an Anglo-Japanese understanding when the time is ripe. (Eleventh Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>The U.S. is Paying Attention to Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in London</h3>

<h3>Reports That Britain Will Provide China with Loans Are Inaccurate</h3>

In fact, there has been no substantive discussion of this matter. Mei Lehe, Counsellor of the Chinese special envoy delegation and Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, has gone to Belfast and will return to London in a few days.

<h3>The Nine-Power Treaty Has Not Yet Become a Dead Letter</h3>
<p>Official Japanese Opinion</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman's personal opinion expressed today, the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the land and administrative integrity of China, must remain the solid foundation for cooperation among the powers related to the Pacific region. Although the treaty may one day become a scrap of paper, as no treaty can exist for one or two hundred years, the treaty is not yet a dead letter today. The spokesman also mentioned the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement, stating that no formal proposal to abolish the agreement has been received from any party. Although China and Japan are the main signatory countries to the agreement, representatives from other countries also helped negotiate it to a successful conclusion at the time. Given the special nature of the Far Eastern political situation, the agreement should remain in effect until China and Japan agree to cancel it or replace it with another agreement. According to reports, the spokesman made this statement because foreign reporters had asked about Shanghai news published in Japanese newspapers, stating that the Chinese government intends to revive the Nine-Power Treaty and cancel the Shanghai Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement in order to delay negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations as much as possible, pending the development of an international situation favorable to China. Therefore, he responded with this statement. (Tenth Central News Agency Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Coronation of the British King</h3>
<p>—Fu</p>
<p>King George VI of Great Britain is holding his coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey today. The grandeur of this ceremony far surpasses that of previous occasions. The cost of the coronation alone amounts to as much as 524,000 pounds (equivalent to over 8 million Chinese dollars). On this grand occasion, not only are the 450 million people under the rule of the British Empire rejoicing, but people from other countries are also expressing their congratulations.</p>
<p>The diplomatic relations between China and Britain have always been very friendly. Especially in the last two or three years, the relationship between the two countries has become even closer. Therefore, on the occasion of this coronation ceremony, the Chinese government has specially appointed Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, and Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi as special envoys to participate in the ceremony, leading many diplomatic, financial, and military experts to London to offer congratulations. Ambassador Guo further stated the Chinese people's congratulations at a banquet hosted on the 5th to entertain Special Envoy Kong and British government dignitaries. Ambassador Guo said, "When the Chinese Art Exhibition was held in London last year, all Chinese people felt proud and elated to be Chinese. But today, it is the opposite. Because the Chinese people in London today almost doubt that they are Chinese and think they are British. This is because they deeply feel the love and respect for the new King and Queen of England and unconsciously rejoice with the British people and the people of the world."</p>
<p>The fact that the Chinese people express such joy for the coronation of the British King is not just because of the "love and respect for the new King and Queen." The main reason is the friendly relations between China and Britain. In the past few years, the relationship between China and Britain has indeed improved compared to before. Especially in terms of currency reform and economic construction, the British government's help has been great. This time, the Chinese delegation in London has received a warm welcome from British officials and civilians. We sincerely hope that in addition to these celebrations, there will be political gains, so that cooperation between the two countries in the Pacific can develop further.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation in the Pacific, in short, is that Japan is implementing its continental policy and constantly attacking China. Not content with occupying the Northeast, Japan is also developing towards North China and central and southern China. Following political and military aggression, it is followed by economic aggression. The result of this aggression not only greatly damages China's territorial sovereignty but also causes great damage to British interests in the Far East. Although Britain tried to find a way to compromise with Japan several years ago to protect its interests in China, Britain no longer seeks a way out in Tokyo after hitting a few snags. As a result, the relationship between China and Britain has gradually become closer. However, in the past month, Japan, in order to break the international isolation, has proposed a method of cooperation with Britain on China. It is said that the British side is already preparing for concrete discussions. This method of cooperation with China will mostly contain the significance of dividing spheres of influence. If Britain disregards the actual situation in the Far East and has a "division of spheres of influence" discussion with Japan, the result will not only greatly deceive Japan, but it will also inevitably encounter the opposition of all the Chinese people. Smart British people would not do such a stupid thing. We are of course deeply convinced of Foreign Minister Eden's statement in the House of Commons on the 5th that "the British government does not want to propose the revival of spheres of influence in China." However, because the issue of "British-Japanese cooperation on China" has too much impact on our country's interests, we take this opportunity to celebrate the coronation of the British King to express the Chinese people's position and attitude.</p>

From now on, I will continue the legacy of the previous king and make our great empire even more prosperous."

"In today's world, all countries are troubled and people are restless. However, among the nations of our Great British Empire, there is still an unbreakable connection.

<h3>Coronation Ceremony Procedures for the British Monarch</h3>
<p>[London] Tomorrow morning at half-past ten, eight gray steeds will emerge from the gates of Buckingham Palace, pulling a four-ton golden royal carriage towards The Mall, through the Admiralty Arch, past the Whitehall government offices, and finally to Westminster Abbey for the coronation ceremony of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The saddles are adorned with red Moroccan leather and gilded embellishments. Four coachmen, each controlling two horses, will be dressed in short purplish-brown attire with gold and black accents, black stockings, white wigs, black riding hats, badges on their chests, and long whips in hand. The carriage is made of elm and was specially crafted for the coronation of King George III. It is twenty-four feet long, painted in gold, and exquisitely made. On the front and rear axles, there stand two mermen figures, supporting and guarding the carriage body. The one in front holds a seashell, symbolizing the arrival of a monarch of the seas, while the one in the rear holds the trident of the sea god. At the center of the carriage roof stand three boys, representing England, Scotland, and Ireland, supporting the British crown. Inside the carriage, the King and Queen will recline on red satin cushions. Walking guards in gold and purple attire will walk alongside the eight horses, tasked with guarding them. Three walking guards, also in purple attire, will stand beside the carriage, responsible for guarding it and opening its doors. In addition to these guards, four more guards will carry halberds as they follow. On either side of the carriage, there will be an officer of the Royal Guard on horseback, sword drawn, closely following the King and Queen. Behind the carriage, there will be eight guards, arranged in two rows. A total of one hundred and sixteen Royal Guards, all mounted and wielding swords, will proceed before and after the royal carriage, each group taking half. Ahead of the Royal Guard, there will be two knights in splendid attire, serving as the vanguard for the procession. The swords of the Royal Guard will gleam, their helmet plumes drooping, with red tunics, white sleeves, and black boots. The colors red, white, and gold will be most prominent among the Royal Guard. However, the soldiers accompanying the procession will wear blue military uniforms. This is the first time the British people have seen blue-uniformed soldiers parading. The blue-clad soldiers will form two long lines along the six-and-a-half-mile route, standing on either side of the road. As the royal carriage of the King and Queen passes, they will present arms in salute. Today, both regular and territorial forces are wearing blue military uniforms, which is unprecedented. The blue trousers, adorned with red stripes, appear even more spirited than the yellow uniforms. Only the London Scottish Regiment will continue to wear brown uniforms, and the rifle brigade will still wear green uniforms. Only soldiers from overseas will wear yellow uniforms. As the royal carriage passes Victoria Memorial outside the palace gates, the crowd will erupt in cheers. From The Mall to Westminster Abbey, the entire route will be filled with joyous shouts, like thunder in the ears. Everywhere the royal carriage passes will be adorned with flags and colorful decorations, shimmering with gold and jade. Along the way, grandstands will be packed with spectators. When the royal carriage arrives at the west entrance of the Abbey, the sound of gongs and drums will resonate loudly. Upon entering, the Archbishop of Canterbury, along with four deans, will come forth to greet them. The King and Queen will then slowly proceed into the Abbey, along a seventeen-foot-wide aisle, past the music stand, and to the coronation altar. The aisle is covered with a blue carpet, one hundred and seventy-three feet long. Eight thousand attendees, upon seeing the royal arrival, will all rise to their feet. From members of the royal family to foreign dignitaries, all will pay their respects to the King. As the King advances, a choir of four hundred will sing "I was glad," a hymn originally composed for the coronation of Edward VII and later augmented for the coronation of George V. The coronation platform is covered with a specially woven tapestry of pale gold. The King and Queen will first kneel down for private prayers and then sit on their thrones, allowing the nation to acknowledge them as their sovereign. This will be followed by the recognition ceremony. The Archbishop, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, and the Lord Great Chamberlain will stand on the platform, first facing east, then turning south, then west, and finally north. At each direction, the Archbishop will loudly proclaim, asking, “Here is your undoubted King. Wherefore all of you are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?” The crowd must shout, "God Save King George." Then the trumpets will sound in unison.</p>
<p>Next is the oath-taking. The Archbishop will ask the new king, "Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australasia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, of all your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, and the Empire of India, according to their respective laws and customs?" The King will answer, "I solemnly promise so to do." The Archbishop will then ask, "Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?" The King will answer, "I will." The Archbishop will ask, "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel and the Protestant Reformed Religion established by Law? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of this Realm, and to the Churches committed to their Charge, all such rights and privileges, as by Law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them?" The King will answer, "All this I promise to do." The new King will then go to the altar, remove his crown, and kneel. With his right hand on the Bible, he will swear, "The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God." Having spoken, he will kiss the Bible, thus completing the oath.</p>
<p>Then the Holy Communion begins. The program commences with prayers, followed by readings from the Epistle and Gospel, and then the singing of the hymn "Come Holy Ghost," and the recitation of the Creed. At this time, the choir sings the anthem from the first chapter of "Kings." By this time, the King has removed his red robe and crown and slowly proceeds to the altar, sitting in King Edward's chair. Four noble lords will spread a golden cloth canopy over him. The Archbishop then anoints the King in the form of a cross with holy oil on both palms, his chest, and the crown of his head. Next, the Bishop of Westminster, after completing a prayer, takes a pair of spurs from the altar and presents them to the Lord Great Chamberlain. The Lord Great Chamberlain then touches the King's heels with them and returns them to the altar.</p>
<p>At this time, the King is presented with the "Sword of State." The Archbishop proclaims, "Use this sword to do justice, stop injustice, protect God's holy Church, support the orphaned and widowed, restore what is decayed, maintain what is restored, punish and reform what is amiss, confirm what is good…"</p>
<p>The King then places the sword on the altar and sits again in King Edward's chair. The nobleman who first received the sword pays one hundred shillings in gold to redeem it and draws it from its scabbard, standing before the new King until the end of the ceremony. The King then puts on an embroidered ceremonial robe. The attendants present the King with a golden orb, which is placed on the altar. Next, the Archbishop places a ring on the King's right hand, on the fourth finger. The King then receives the scepter. The Archbishop descends from the altar, takes the crown from the Bishop of Westminster, and places it on the King's head.</p>
<p>As the aforementioned ceremonies proceed, the attendees in the Abbey remain silent and still. When the King is crowned, the crowd shouts, "God Save the King," and the trumpets sound in unison. The nobles also place their coronets on their heads amidst the singing of hymns. After the crowning, the King ascends the throne. The Archbishop, the Duke of Gloucester, other members of the royal family, dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, and leaders, each in turn, approach the new King, touch his crown, and kiss his left cheek to show their allegiance. This ceremony takes about fifteen minutes. At the same time, six verses of an oath of allegiance are sung. Next, the bishops and other nobles each perform the allegiance ceremony in their respective ranks. After the ceremony, drums sound loudly, trumpets blare in unison, and the crowd in the Abbey shouts, "God Save King George," "Long Live King George," and "May our King Reign Forever."</p>
<p>Next, the Queen undergoes the anointing and coronation ceremony. The ceremony is similar to the King's, but much less elaborate. As the Queen slowly walks past the King, who is seated on his throne, she bows to him and takes her place on her own throne. Then the organ plays loudly, and the orchestra sings hymns to specially composed music. The King and Queen together rise from their thrones and walk to the steps of the altar, remove their crowns, kneel, perform the offertory, and participate in the second part of the Holy Communion. The King and Queen both receive Holy Communion, which is blessed by the Archbishop. Then, to specially composed music, they sing hymns. The new King then puts down all the royal regalia and enters St. Edward's Chapel, removes the crown jewels, and changes into a purple velvet robe. The King and Queen then walk along the route they entered, led by the choir, to the west gate. The King holds the scepter with the cross on his right hand and the golden orb on his left. The Queen also holds a scepter in her right hand, while her left hand holds an ivory staff topped with a dove. Both the King and Queen wear crowns. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters)</p>

<p>[London] After flying across the Atlantic, the famous American aviator Mr. Maurell landed at the North Weald airfield in Essex at 6:10 PM today. After a brief stop, he flew to London, arriving at the Croydon Airport at 6:39 PM. Without this stop, Mr. Maurell would have been the first person to fly directly from New York to London. Mr. Maurell said that the weather along the way was bad, which caused him to arrive late. He hopes to fly back to New York on Thursday. Mr. Lambie, who accompanied him, said that the average speed was 160 miles per hour, and the entire journey took twenty hours and thirty-one minutes, setting a new record for flying from New York to any place in the British Isles.

<h3>A Short History of the British King and His Family (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>-- Special</p>
<p>The King's concern for the happiness of children stems from his natural disposition. One day, two mischievous boys in London knocked on the door requesting to see him, saying, "We used to play in a corner of a wasteland, but now construction is starting there, so where will we play in the future?" The King said, "Be patient, and I will find a solution for you." So the King made a phone call, asking the London Municipal Authorities to create another playground for the children. Before sunrise the next day, the King told the children, "A certain place can be used for your future games." This matter was often praised by Londoners and became a popular anecdote. Therefore, when King George V held the 25th anniversary of his reign, the King was particularly interested in matters concerning the promotion of the happiness of young men and women in the celebration program, and spared no effort in sponsoring them. One day, the King presided over a conference at the Albert Hall and received the blessings of the Boy Scouts. In the Boy Scouts' relay of the silver staff, about 2,000 children passed it on day and night, covering 2,300 miles before reaching the London venue. The King solemnly preserved this staff and the naval ensign presented by the officers and crew of the HMS Collingwood on the day the ship fought, regarding them as a special honor.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1920, the King was promoted to Duke of York. Three years later, with the permission of his parents, he became engaged to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore. It is said that initially the lady and both sets of parents hesitated for quite some time about this matter, but this was merely to test the sincerity of the young couple's affection. Therefore, in April 1923, the King married the current Queen in Westminster Abbey, to national jubilation, and they were regarded as a perfect match. When the bride walked up the nave, she stopped at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior and respectfully placed a bouquet of white roses on the tomb, intending to represent her elder brother, who died in France during the war. After the ceremony, as the newlyweds drove past the cheering crowd outside Buckingham Palace, they paused for a moment in front of the Cenotaph. These two incidents were merely occasional actions of the Duke and Duchess of York, but they deeply moved the people. It is said that when the newlyweds left Buckingham Palace for their honeymoon that day, the Prince of Wales (the Crown Prince) reached into the car and bid farewell to his sister-in-law, saying, "Take good care of yourself, Madame is the future Queen of England." Unexpectedly, these words have now come true.</p>
<p>Lady Elizabeth was born in Hertfordshire on August 4, 1900, and is the only daughter of the Earl of Strathmore. There are a total of ten siblings, and when the European War broke out, all the brothers except for the one who was still too young joined the army. One of them, Fergus, died in France. Not long after the war started, the Earl's Glamis Castle was converted into a military hospital to accommodate and care for soldiers. The lady, only fourteen years old, was already able to assist her mother in managing the hospital affairs. In her spare time, she took care of the wives and children of the soldiers serving in the army and knitted socks for the soldiers on the front lines, in no way resembling a pampered aristocratic daughter. The lady was supervised by her loving mother from a young age, studying at home, and the impact of the war was sufficient to aid her education, for at that time, everyone had a spirit of loving their compatriots and serving the country. The lady had a pure and honest nature, and under the influence of this ethos, she fulfilled her responsibilities like an adult. When the lady's marriage was approaching, the residents of her hometown of Angus planned to collect money to purchase a dowry gift, but the lady, knowing that everyone was suffering from the impact of the economic downturn at the time, did not want to burden her fellow villagers and strongly refused. On one occasion, the Sheffield cutlery workers held an annual banquet and invited the Duke of York to participate, but the new King, seeing that the people were struggling and that many were unemployed, felt that the money should be used to help the poor and resolutely declined. This fully demonstrates that the new King and Queen both have a compassionate heart for their fellow human beings.</p>
<p>The lady was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of Princess Mary, and she sat side by side with Prince Albert (the name of the new King) at the morning wedding banquet. At that time, the lady was only six years old, and the new King was eleven. As children, they often played together. After a short while, they parted and were separated for fifteen years. They only reunited the year after the end of the European War. At that time, the lady had grown into a graceful and beautiful young woman, and her radiant smile was particularly moving. Years ago, the Archbishop of Canterbury praised the Duchess of York's smile, saying, "The smile of the Duchess of York is a good omen for the British Empire." Her smile is genuine, full of sincerity, and without any pretense. Those who see it can dispel worry and sorrow and feel cheerful. In addition, the lady inherited her mother's literary interests, and is skilled in dancing, tennis, riding, and hunting. The new King, finding that the lady shared his interests, loved her very much and proposed to her twice but was refused. One day, while riding together in the countryside, the new King repeated his request, and the lady finally agreed. Thus, the two lovers finally became husband and wife. After the new King's marriage, the couple traveled together in Northern Ireland and then went hunting in East Africa, returning with great memories. In 1927, the new Parliament Building in Australia was completed, and the new King, on the order of his father, went to perform the opening ceremony. The new King suffered from a stutter, which had been treated repeatedly without success, so he was very worried that he would reveal his shortcomings when he gave a speech in public during the ceremony. But the new King was determined, practicing pronunciation beforehand, working hard for months day and night. His chronic problem was as if lost. On the appointed day, in front of the crowd at the new Parliament Building in Canberra, he spoke eloquently without any hesitation. Where there's a will, there's a way. On this trip, he first arrived in Jamaica on the cruiser HMS Renown, then passed through the Panama Canal and crossed the Pacific Ocean, visited the Marquesas Islands and Fiji, and arrived in New Zealand on February 22nd. He performed the ceremony in Canberra on May 9th, and returned to Beijing in July. The new Queen also accompanied him.</p>
<p>When the new King lived in the country, the various duties he performed cannot be fully listed, but many of them were the responsibilities that the heir to the throne should fulfill, such as going to Belgium twice, once to attend the opening ceremony of the International Exhibition, and once to represent the royal family at the funeral of the Queen of Belgium, all of which were appropriate for the Crown Prince to do. After the death of George V, the royal family stopped social activities for several months. The new King took advantage of this time to inspect various industrial areas. Last winter, his elder brother Edward VIII, wanting to marry Mrs. Simpson, was prevented by the constitution and opposed by the ministers, so he abdicated by edict. Subsequently, the royal family and the ministers jointly decided that the Duke of York should succeed to the throne. May 12th, originally the date for Edward's coronation, the new King, in order to satisfy the wishes of the people, still chose this day to perform the coronation ceremony with his Queen in Westminster Abbey. From the grand celebration throughout the country, one can see the fervor of the people's love and support.</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War, the new King has often had to participate in ceremonial affairs, which he disliked very much. The new King always liked to enjoy family happiness with his parents. His happiest time was when he spent time with his Queen and two daughters, or when he took the dogs, carried a film camera, and walked in the garden. One day, a film company asked the new King to allow them to film his family, and the new King replied, "There is no need for that, I have already done it myself." The new King does not seek quick solutions to problems. Whenever a problem arises, he studies it thoroughly and does not spare himself the labor. He must wait until he has fully understood it before he stops. The new King avoids superficial actions in his work. He is especially dissatisfied with explanations that are perfunctory and do not get to the heart of the matter. Every time he does something, like his father, he must seek his own peace of mind. No matter how big or small the matter, once he has agreed to it, he will do his best to accomplish it. This is also in keeping with his father's style. The new King has a strong will, which is also a hereditary trait. However, he is receptive to advice and trusts those he deems trustworthy without reservation. After the new King ascended the throne, he did not change his usual habits. It is still remembered that the new King spent his first Christmas with his family quietly at Sandringham, went to church in the morning, and distributed gifts to the children in the afternoon. For the remaining days of the holiday, he went hunting with close friends, maintaining the ancient customs of England. Some say that this is a good omen for the new dynasty in England. Sir Gregg, an old friend of the new King, said a few years ago, "The Duke of York is not a fickle person. The people may not yet understand the strength of his character, but one day he will be as loved by the people as his father." These few words can serve as an outline of the new King's character.</p>
<p>The new Queen has been enthusiastic about public welfare since she was a child. After becoming the Duchess of York, she worked even harder. The social responsibilities she takes on are very numerous. In her family life, she prepares meals for her two daughters in the morning, plays with them in the afternoon, and sits by the fireplace with the new King in the evening, reading books and newspapers or playing the piano, deserving the title of a virtuous mother and wife. But as Queen, as the mother of the nation, the weight of her responsibilities is naturally different from what it was before. Her two daughters, one named Elizabeth, who is just eleven years old, and the other named Rose, who is not yet seven, Elizabeth resembles her father in appearance. From a young age, she has been trained to one day rule the empire. Now, she is indeed the heir to the throne. For this reason, she has hired tutors to teach her at home, rather than sending her to school. She takes classes every morning from 9:30 AM to noon. In the afternoon, she often drives out for excursions. She is intelligent and lively, and is loved by the people. Her younger sister is just starting her studies, and according to her teachers, she is making good progress.</p>
<p>The new King's mother, Queen Mary, is still alive and well. She is kind and compassionate, and has a strong sense of responsibility. She usually collects art and enjoys gardening as a pastime. In the New Year's edict issued by the new King, he stated his inherited responsibilities, saying, "I undertake these responsibilities with a trusting heart, knowing that the Queen and the Queen Mother are by my side to help me." This fully demonstrates the new King's respect and filial piety towards his elderly mother. The new King has two younger brothers, one is the Duke of Gloucester, and the other is the Duke of Kent, both of whom are talented and capable of assisting the monarch. His elder brother, the abdicated King Edward VIII, now the Duke of Windsor, has already scheduled a wedding with Mrs. Simpson in France to fulfill his long-cherished wish. (End)</p>
<h3>London Diplomatic Contacts</h3>
<p>Eden Meets with Representatives of Various Countries Busily Conferring with Czechoslovakia and Austria on Central European Issues</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov this morning for a lengthy discussion. He also met with Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Lozoraitis. As for German Defense Minister General von Blomberg, he will visit Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon. (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Czech Prime Minister Hodza and Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, representing their respective governments, came here to attend the King's coronation ceremony. Today, they jointly visited Foreign Secretary Eden to discuss Central European issues. It is reported that the two men strongly asserted to Eden that Britain and France must take concrete actions in Central Europe, otherwise the small countries of Central Europe will be enticed by the Rome-Berlin political axis and will be under Berlin's protection. As a result, Germany may achieve its initial plan to dominate Central Europe. In particular, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt insisted that Austria is determined to be independent and unwilling to join any international group. At the same time, he also expressed his deep desire to cooperate with neighboring countries in the Danube River basin. In addition, it is reported that Czech Prime Minister Hodza proposed a concrete plan for economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River basin. This plan should start with economic cooperation between the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria, and Hungary. Secondly, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia can also participate. Finally, Germany and Italy can also join the economic cooperation. It is generally believed that Yugoslavia recently signed a political and economic agreement with Italy, so it is more difficult to join this type of cooperation. However, Hodza will attend a banquet at Buckingham Palace tonight and take the opportunity to hold talks with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the first regent, which may serve as a preparation for Yugoslavia's joining the Danube River cooperation plan. It is also generally believed that the purpose of Hodza's proposal is only economic cooperation among the countries of the Danube River basin. This cooperation can serve as a preparation for the future conclusion of political agreements. Given the current environment, it is difficult to achieve an agreement among the Danube River countries to not interfere in internal affairs, so it is necessary to postpone it.

<h3>The King of England's Coronation Ceremony Captivates the World</h3>

<p>United States</p>
<p>[New York] The attention of Americans to the news of the King of England's coronation is so great that neither the "Hindenburg" disaster nor the arrival of the American aviator Mr. Mowry in England today can distract them. American newspapers are most focused on this news item. For example, the Sunday edition of the New York Times has as many as nineteen columns on coronation news. Most newspapers carry various images of the coronation transmitted by wireless telegraph. Americans living in the country can hear the sounds and actions of the coronation ceremony as if they were witnessing it in person. Major radio stations will be dedicated to broadcasting everything transmitted from London, without interruption from beginning to end. The King's speech will be heard in every town and village in America. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters)</p>

The public here clearly feels a strong interest in this grand ceremony. According to the London correspondent of the Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, the entire British Empire is celebrating the King's coronation as if celebrating a "family feast, and this family is so large that its fate not only concerns itself, but even affects everything.

It continued, "Today, the reason why the world is focused on London is to discover the important events and activities related to world peace behind this ceremony." It concluded, "The German people sincerely wish the King and Queen to consolidate the unity of the Empire internally and contribute to world peace externally." (11th, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Labor Unrest Intensifies Amidst the King's Coronation</h3>
<p>London Transport Industry Decides to Continue Strike Coal Mine Labor-Management Dispute Negotiations Break Down</p>
<p>[London] The results of the bus workers' meeting and the miners' meeting tonight have darkened the atmosphere in the British labor world. After the bus workers' meeting, Bevin, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, announced that the majority of workers rejected the London Transport Board's proposal and decided to continue the strike. Their second step will be to submit the issue of extending the strike to other industries to the executive council for review. Judging from the situation, the labor unrest cannot be quelled in a short time. 12,000 tram and streetcar workers are also at risk of joining the strike. The bus workers are demanding a 7.5-hour workday, which the interim report of the court of inquiry did not approve.</p>
<p>At the same time, Minister of Mines Crosland's mediation of the Harvey coal mine dispute has failed. The Nottingham coal mine owners and the so-called Spencer Union have refused to have unconditional meetings with the Miners' Federation. Therefore, the Miners' Federation has decided to issue a notice on Saturday and Sunday, setting the start of the strike for May 29. However, the Ministry of Mines will make further efforts to achieve an unconditional meeting of the three parties before this date. (Central News Agency, 10th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Although officials have made every effort to mediate the London bus strike and the Nottingham mining dispute, hoping to resolve them before Coronation Day, there is still no hope of resolution. The London Transport Board's recent proposal, namely that the Board is willing to discuss all the points raised by the bus workers, except for the 7.5-hour workday, and is willing to submit all points to a court of inquiry if a direct compromise cannot be reached, has been rejected by the majority of bus drivers. The efforts of Minister of Mines Crosland to mediate the Harvey coal mine dispute have also been unsuccessful. However, the expansion of the bus strike will not materialize for the time being, although 12,000 tram and streetcar workers are now hoping that the Transport and General Workers' Union will allow them to join the strike, the union executive is unlikely to approve such a movement. It is expected that the executive will advise tram workers to continue working as usual. As for the underground railway employees, they belong to the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and are not members of the Transport and General Workers' Union. The secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen stated today that there is currently no issue involving underground railway employees. (Central News Agency, 11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The London bus strike is likely to be protracted, and will inevitably become a stalemate during the King's coronation ceremony, and cannot be resolved. Officials are extremely worried about this, and are making special efforts to conceal it from exposure. General observers now feel that the bus strike and the coal mine strike, both occurring within a week of the coronation ceremony, are not accidental, but seem to be instigated and directed by extremist elements. Although the extremists have made the workers believe that this strike is purely motivated by professional reasons, in reality it still has political implications in secret. Recognizing this, the authorities have adopted an extremely mild attitude, so as not to provoke the strikers. For example, during the British general strike in 1926, private companies used trucks to provide public transportation services. The current bus strikers have announced that if such a situation occurs, they will not tolerate it. Therefore, although some private companies attempted to take action last week, they were all dissuaded by the authorities and did not materialize. This is clear evidence of the authorities' mild attitude. In general, the authorities will maintain this attitude during the coronation celebration period, but if the strike movement spreads, the authorities may intervene actively.

<h3>Tianjin Haihe River Floating Corpse Case</h3>
<p>Someone Exploiting Strong Men to Dispose of Bodies Two Arrested by Police Bureau Full Investigation Underway</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, Floating corpses have continuously appeared in the Dazhigu area of the Haihe River in Tianjin. From early April to October 7th, a total of eighty-seven corpses have been recovered, gray-purple and swollen, in a state of extreme misery. The Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, the Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau, the Five River Water Police Bureau, the Maritime Police Bureau, the Gendarmerie, and the Tianjin County Government, and other land and water security agencies, sent out detectives in all directions, forming a dense net along the river. Reporting that the concessions on the west bank of the Haihe River, we have no right to enter, looking across the river, affects the speed of solving the case to some extent. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, who is currently in Tianjin, considers the floating corpses in the Haihe River to be coming continuously, three or five or seven or eight bodies per day, the number is alarming, and it concerns the lives of the people, and specifically ordered the municipal authorities that anyone who knows the source of the floating corpses and informs the officials, leading to the cracking of the case, will be rewarded with 5,000 yuan. Public officials who report and lead to the cracking of the case will be promoted three ranks. At 3:00 PM on the 8th, several detectives from the Municipal Police Bureau were on guard on the Jintang Bridge on the Haihe River, along the river's vegetable market, south and adjacent to the Japanese concession, and discovered four workers-like strong men, carrying a corpse on their shoulders from north to south, (According to the south side, namely the Japanese concession, where the Chinese and Japanese border is located, the place name is Zhakou, from Zhakou to the Jintang Bridge, the riverbank is the vegetable market) intending to abandon the corpse into the river and then escape. The detectives on guard quickly moved forward to arrest them, two of whom were captured on the spot, and the other two, due to their agility, turned around and fled south, and were not caught after being chased to the concession. The two strong men who were caught and the corpse were taken to the headquarters of the detective team of the police bureau. It was then learned that the corpse had not yet died and could still speak. According to one of the strong men, Yang Xiang, he makes a living by pulling carts, and sometimes carries burdens along the river. He was exploited by someone to carry a corpse from the roadside to the river market, and was about to run back south when he was arrested. Another strong man, named Kong Zhaoyuan, gave a similar statement to Yang Xiang, stating that he also makes a living by carrying burdens due to financial difficulties. The person who moved the corpse removed the clothes worn by the corpse before throwing it into the river to sell for money. The detective team re-examined the corpse, which had not yet died. According to the corpse, his name is Jia Rongqi, aged ten years, from Cang County, Hebei Province. He used to make paper cards for a living. A few months ago, he came to Tianjin from his hometown. He stated that due to difficulty in speaking, he needs to be rescued and recuperated before a detailed inquiry. The detective team believes that this case is important and needs to be thoroughly investigated before being transferred to the Third Section of the Police Bureau on the night of the 8th. (Night of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Concession in Tianjin Actively Expands</h3>
<p>Buying Land on Behalf of the Japanese Through Traitorous Citizens Authorities Attempt Passive Crackdown</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, The Japanese concession authorities are planning to purchase land in the Haojiatai area outside Nanmenying, attempting to expand. The Japanese concession authorities have already purchased it through the hands of the traitorous citizen He, and have evicted the old shops and are carrying out construction very quickly. In the current situation, it is feared that it can be completed before the scheduled time. The land from west of Haojia to the Great Assembly Farm, the Great Qing Chemical Society, and Liulitai is still being purchased in large quantities. However, after the official discovered this matter, the Municipal Government specially ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to investigate and prohibit it. Because of the constraints of the situation, they cannot directly restrict the Japanese from buying. Therefore, they only have passive measures, ordering each detective to pay attention to the activities of the traitorous citizens and crack down on them. At the same time, in order to prevent the Japanese concession from expanding without end, they ordered the Municipal Works Bureau to build a road from outside Nanmenying to Donglou Village as a restriction. However, our road has not yet started construction, and the Japanese are actively purchasing land. Recently, they have not hesitated to offer high prices, so many deals were still made last week. As for the land purchased by Japanese private enterprises for the construction of factories, it is mostly in the Tianjin County boundary. The Municipal Government, on the orders of the Central Government, ordered the Tianjin County Government to thoroughly investigate and prohibit it. However, the buyers buy and the sellers sell, regarding the government's ban as worthless. Therefore, the County Government, in order to punish one as a warning to a hundred, recently arrested a certain official Zhang from a certain agency, intending to send him to the Municipal Government for transfer to the court for severe punishment, because Zhang colluded with traitorous citizens to steal and sell national land or official property to the Japanese from the spring onwards, and the ill-gotten gains have already exceeded 100,000 yuan. The land sold by him to foreigners amounts to several thousand acres. The places where the land was stolen and sold are mostly Louzhuangzi, Balitai, and Xiguangkai. Zhang has many accomplices, and many people have been running around to rescue him after his arrest. The authorities advocate strict investigation and punishment, and may even send him to the Hebei Provincial Government in Baoding for disposal.</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the Japanese concession has now become a reality, for all the ten pieces of land purchased by the traitorous citizen He in the Haojiatai area, the authorities, in view of the fact that it is impossible to return them even after negotiations, have decided not to investigate the ones that have been purchased, and strictly prevent all the ones that have not been purchased or are being discussed. The detective team of the Municipal Police Bureau is now deploying secret posts and engaging in reconnaissance of this matter. Although ordinary traitorous citizens do not dare to purchase openly, they still negotiate constantly while hiding in a certain concession. Therefore, sometimes the original landowners do not even know that a piece of land has been sold. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, who came to Tianjin, is very concerned about this, and secretly ordered the competent authorities to investigate and arrest the traitorous citizens who stole and sold national land, and to prevent the free expansion of the Japanese concession. The Sheng Nongyuan agricultural experimental field that the Japanese are planning to establish in Louzhuangzi has also been ordered by the responsible authorities to politely persuade them not to realize it. Therefore, this matter is probably a newly emerging diplomatic problem in North China recently. (10th)</p>
<h3>Gansu Hexi Counties Appeal for Disaster Relief Group Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>Requesting Assistance from the Central Government and Various Charitable Organizations And Petitioning the Government to Exempt Regular and Miscellaneous Taxes</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence, Since the earthquake disaster in Gansu Hexi counties in the 16th year of the Republic of China, followed by floods, the 17th and 18th years were ravaged by warfare, and the people were exhausted. Afterwards, they suffered from drought, hail, frost, rat, wind, sand, and continuous rain disasters, the local vitality was greatly damaged, and the people's wounds were not healed. Moreover, last winter, 40,000 to 50,000 communist bandits crossed the Hexi River and fled, capturing the county towns of Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, Linze, and Gaotai, and harassing the counties of Jingtai, Yongdeng, Wuwei, Minqin, Minle, and Zhangye. According to statistics, the losses of the people in various counties are no less than 20 million yuan. The disaster-stricken people are about 60,000 households and more than 370,000 people. Recently, they have no ability to sow in the spring, and it is difficult to expect a harvest in the autumn, and it will inevitably evolve into a tragic situation of exchanging skeletons and selling children. Although the Central Government has allocated funds for emergency relief, the disaster situation in Hexi counties is extremely severe, and it is difficult to solve the problem with a drop in the bucket. In order to seek fundamental relief, local people have publicly elected representatives Tang Fake, Zan Jianxing, Quan Guoyi, Chen Shengfan, Zhang Yuanchun, Zhu Mingde, Zhang Jianhou, Liu Kenian, Tang Jinwen, Zhang Shanggong, Wan Rongchun, Zhang Zhensheng, and other twelve people to form an appeal group, and come to Beijing to appeal to the Central Government and various charitable organizations to continue to allocate funds for disaster relief, and to petition the government to exempt regular and miscellaneous taxes. The group has now arrived in Beijing and is appealing for disaster relief separately.</p>

<h3>Frequent Fires in Guangzhou in Recent Days</h3>
<p>More Than Forty Shops Destroyed One Fatality More Than 100,000 Yuan in Losses</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Fires have been frequent in Guangzhou in recent days. It is estimated that in the past three days, there have been two major fires and one minor fire, with losses of more than 100,000 yuan, and there have been casualties. In the past, fires usually occurred in the dry winter season, but now it is late spring and early summer, and it rains frequently, but fires have occurred repeatedly. It is really an abnormal event. It was found that around dusk on April 29, at No. 543 Xihua Road in the city, the owner of the Heli Cotton Factory, Lu Tan, had a partner of four or five people who recently sold old cotton made by electric machines. The business was relatively stable. However, when the machine was turned on that night, the electric machine suddenly released an electric current, and the flames shot out in the shop, and they were at a loss and fled in a panic alone. All the factory equipment was not moved in time. In a blink of an eye, the fire spread, and after the fire brigades from all roads rushed to rescue, it was extinguished after about three hours. It is estimated that the Heli Factory, Dahua Hotel, Yili Grocery Store, Beauty Salon, Renshengtang Medicinal Material Store, Ertai Coal Store, Xia Quan'an Shed Factory, Yuanshenghao, No. 549 vacant house, No. 551 Li Residence, No. 599 vacant house, Quanxing Shed Factory, and four wooden houses in Liancai New Lane were burned down. According to statistics, a total of seventeen shops were burned down, with a loss of about 50,000 yuan. During the fire, five people were injured and burned. Also, at 0:35 on the 30th, a fire broke out on the main street of Longwei Daonan in Henan, suddenly turning into a prairie fire. Previously, in the Longshengxiang Paper Shop on the street, before each partner went to bed, somehow, a fire was left in the paper basket. The partners went into deep sleep and did not notice it. When the flames were approaching, the shop assistants were awakened and called for help, but it was impossible to put out the fire. One of the shop assistants rushed out of the thick smoke and telegraphed the fire brigades to drive over to put out the fire. At this time, six nearby shops had caught fire. There were no tap water facilities in the area, and the spring water was not enough to supply. Therefore, the fire trucks were almost helpless. Finally, it burned for more than an hour before the fire was extinguished. The shops destroyed were: Longshengxiang Paper Shop, Hengchang Paper Firecracker Shop, Fushoutang Medicinal Material Shop, Gongyuan Inn Preserved Meat Shop, Renshouxuan Medicinal Material Shop, Changji Preserved Meat Shop, Linan Cake Shop, Longshengchang Grocery Store, Chengji Fish Shop, Rongtailong Beijing Confectionery Shop, An Pig Meat Shop, Yuexing Tofu Shop, Yaolai Pig Meat Shop, Qingshoutang Medicinal Material Shop, Heji Fish Stall, Shangji Vegetable Stall, Liangji Pig Meat Shop, in addition, there are Huangzhai, etc. The above two fires resulted in losses of 130,000 yuan. On the evening of the 30th, the God of Fire again visited Weixin South Road, and the Chenganchang Fruit Shop at No. 5 on the road suddenly burned down. At 11:00 PM, the five shop assistants escaped from the back of the neighboring houses. Only Li Fa, a colleague who lodged in the shop, died in the fire pit due to his old age and infirmity. As a result, the entire shop was burned down.</p>

<p>Mulberry Leaf Shortage Causes Price Hike</p>
<p>This year, there are many silk farmers in the countryside. However, there are more silkworms than leaves.

<p>Liyuan Factory Strike for One Day</p>
<p>The Liyuan Cloth Factory outside the Shuimen Bridge in the eastern gate of Wuyi was founded by Zhu Yongsheng and others, with Zhu Zican-sheng serving as the factory director and developing the business. Last year, the factory earned a profit of over 10,000 yuan and expanded its operations. This spring, a personnel department was added, and Cheng Liewu was hired as the director to manage the hiring and firing of employees within the factory. Recently, workers expressed dissatisfaction with Cheng's strict management. On the morning of the 10th, four to five hundred male and female workers went on strike and left the factory at 6:00 AM, gathering at the nearby Yizhou Pavilion. Factory director Zhu Huaisheng immediately telephoned the police station, which dispatched police to maintain order. The workers requested Jiang Dingsheng, a cadre from the county party headquarters, to represent them and presented four conditions: ㊀ Immediately dismiss Cheng Liewu, the director of the personnel department; ㊁ Improve sanitation facilities; ㊂ Reinstate promotions; ㊃ Do not dismiss workers without cause. Jiang Dingsheng, together with Xu Baoguang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, negotiated with the factory owners. However, the only demand was to dismiss Director Cheng. Zhu Yongsheng, to avoid escalating the situation, expressed acceptance of the labor's conditions, with Director Cheng temporarily not entering the factory until the labor dispute was resolved. The workers agreed to resume work on the 11th. The factory's 24-hour shutdown is estimated to have caused a loss of six to seven hundred yuan.</p>

<h3>Minister He Holds Reception for All Sectors Regarding Relief for Drought in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Decision to Establish Guizhou Drought Relief Association; He Appointed as President, Yu and Yang as Vice Presidents</p>
<p>The drought in Guizhou Province is severe. Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, concerned about his hometown, held a tea party at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon to invite leaders from all sectors of Shanghai to discuss relief measures. Those in attendance included Yu Hongjun, Qian Dajun, Yang Hu, Jiang Dingwen, Cai Jingjun, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Chengying, He Jiwu, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Wen Lanting, Mu Ouchu, Gu Xinyi, Cheng Jingsheng, Lin Kanghou, Tang Shoumin, Song Hanzhang, Wu Yunqi, Lu Bohong, Chen Xing, Huang Hanzhi, and over a hundred others. At the meeting, the Shanghai Guizhou Drought Relief Association was established, with He Yingqin appointed as the president. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman He Yingqin reported, "Today, I have arranged this gathering and provided tea and refreshments to invite representatives from charitable organizations in Shanghai to discuss relief for the drought in Guizhou Province. I am grateful to all of you for attending. First, on behalf of the millions of disaster victims in Guizhou Province, I express my gratitude. I would also like to take this opportunity to report on the disaster situation in Guizhou. Guizhou has many mountains and little farmland, and as a remote and impoverished province in the southwest, its local produce has always been insufficient to meet its own needs. Over the years, it has suffered from either drought or floods, and disasters have occurred repeatedly. In the past, due to political instability, preparations for disaster prevention and relief were extremely inadequate. In the past two years, banditry has further intensified the situation, with looting, arson, and killing. The homes of many families are empty, and any public or private reserves have been used to supply the local area. In particular, in many counties that have been disturbed by bandits, forests have been almost completely cut down, turning into bare mountains. Cattle have also been slaughtered, destroying the tools for agricultural work. Therefore, in the past, disasters in Guizhou Province were mainly floods, but this year, due to climate change and scarce rainfall, there has been an unprecedented drought. I have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Chairman Gu of the Guizhou Provincial Government and local elders. Furthermore, Commissioner Cheng Jingsheng of the Central Relief Commission, who recently returned to Beijing from Guizhou, spoke in great detail about the disaster situation in Guizhou. Since autumn, there has been no rain for several months. Rivers have dried up, wells have run dry, and the soil is cracked. Not only is irrigation difficult, but people cannot even obtain daily drinking water. The spring harvest is already hopeless, and the main crop cannot be planted. According to reports, the affected counties include Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, Guiyang, Anshun, Pingyue, Xifeng, Anlong, Meitan, Xingren, Xingyi, Guanling, Puan, Majiang, Annan, Bijie, Weining, Pingba, Puding, Guodai, Qingzhen, Zhenfeng, Guangshun, Suiyang, Kaiyang, Zhengan, Shui, Zhenning, Zhixin, Xiuwen, Shiqian, Zhouheng, Zhaohai, Zhenyuan, Guiding, Dingfan, Huangping, Lushan, Dading, Dushan, Bazhai, Qianxi, Sanhe, Datang, Yinjiang, Longli, Dejiang, Wengan, Cenggong, Pingzhou, Shibing, Shangqing, Wangsui, Luodian, Jiangkou, Songtao, and other counties. Among them, the disaster is most severe in Zunyi, Tongzi, Renhuai, Chishui, and over ten other counties, which urgently need emergency relief. The details of the disaster situation are provided in the survey report recently sent by the Guizhou Provincial Government, which has been printed in multiple copies for your reference. According to a telegram from Chairman Gu, the proposed relief measures are divided into three points: (1) Provide emergency relief, that is, provide 30,000 to 8,000 yuan to each of the counties most severely affected, such as Zunyi and Tongzi, based on the severity of the disaster, and send personnel to investigate and distribute the funds; (2) Provide agricultural relief, distribute seeds to save the autumn harvest; (3) Provide industrial relief, open branches and dredge ditches in the affected counties in the Wujiang, Panjiang, and Qingshui River basins, and dig wells and ponds in areas lacking water sources to supplement irrigation. The emergency relief requires approximately 400,000 yuan in cash. The industrial relief can not only alleviate the current disaster but also prevent future droughts. However, the project is vast, and no matter how tightly it is budgeted, it requires over 1 million yuan in cash. In total, only 300,000 yuan has been approved for relief. This is far from enough for emergency relief, and there is no funding for agricultural and industrial relief. Although people from Guizhou Province in Beijing have made repeated appeals, the central government's finances are also strained, and uneven distribution is unavoidable. Gentlemen, I admire your concern for the disaster victims in the remote provinces and your enthusiasm for helping others. I hope that you will use your influence to quickly seek relief for the millions of disaster victims. If you raise your voices, philanthropists from all walks of life will surely respond and gather a large amount of aid, so that the disaster victims who are waiting to be fed can receive real benefits. Regarding the disaster situation in Guizhou Province, what I have reported just now is only a general overview. As for the detailed situation, Mr. Cheng Jingsheng, who has just returned from inspecting Guizhou Province, will give a detailed report later. Regarding the fundraising and relief measures, Mr. He Jiwu, a member of the Guizhou Provincial Government, and Mr. Wang Chengying, Director of the Finance Department, have already come to Shanghai and have discussed the matter with you. I hope that you will not hesitate to provide guidance and come up with more ideas. As the saying goes, 'Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda.' The millions of disaster victims in Guizhou Province are in urgent need of rescue. I sincerely ask you to fulfill this great wish, to relieve the suffering and avert the disaster. I cannot stay in Shanghai for long due to busy affairs in Beijing. Please provide instructions on how to raise funds and provide relief, so that the process can proceed smoothly. I raise this glass to plead for the disaster victims in Guizhou Province and wish you all good health." After the establishment of the relief association, Commissioner Cheng Jingsheng of the Relief Commission reported on his disaster survey, briefly stating that he was assigned to survey the disaster in Guizhou Province. Since March of last year, there has been no rain in Guizhou Province. Among the 81 counties, 62 have been affected by the disaster, and the number of disaster victims has reached 2,762,276. The disaster is severe, and he hopes that philanthropists from all walks of life will actively donate so that industrial and agricultural relief in Guizhou Province can be realized as soon as possible. Then, Wang Chengying, Director of the Guizhou Finance Department, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Qu Wenliu, and others expressed their opinions. It was decided to establish the Shanghai Guizhou Drought Relief Association, with He Yingqin as the president and Yu Hongjun and Yang Xiaotian as the vice presidents. Qu Wenliu, Cheng Jingsheng, Wang Chengying, and He Jiwu were appointed to draft the charter and donation appeal. It was also decided to hold a committee meeting on the afternoon of the 14th of this month (Friday) at 4:00 PM to discuss the charter and elect honorary presidents and executive directors in order to carry out fundraising. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General's Intelligence Chief Tajiri Visits Gan Jiehou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Both Sides Inquire About Sino-Japanese Issues</p>
<p>Shen Shi News reports that Mr. Tajiri Aiyi, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, visited Mr. Gan Jiehou, the representative of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, at the Huayi Hotel yesterday morning for about an hour. A reporter from Shen Shi News happened to be visiting Mr. Gan and asked him about the content of the conversation. Mr. Gan replied that it was a private social gathering. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe was the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou when he (Gan) was the special diplomatic envoy to Guangdong and Guangxi. Tajiri was the Deputy Consul in Hankou nine years ago when he (Gan) was the special diplomatic envoy to Hubei. Therefore, they all knew each other. Knowing that he (Gan) was in Shanghai, Tajiri came to reminisce about old times. The reporter insisted on asking about the content of the conversation. Mr. Gan then readily agreed, saying that there was nothing that could not be made public in his conversation with Tajiri. He told the reporter the content, thinking that Tajiri would not object. He (Gan) asked Tajiri what concrete measures would be taken after Foreign Minister Sato announced his diplomatic policy. Tajiri replied that Ambassador Kawagoe had only met with Minister Wang once or twice since Minister Wang took office, and Ambassador Kawagoe would not be able to return here for another month. Therefore, no concrete discussions had yet been held. Foreign Minister Sato's declaration was an indirect expression to China, and China should now have a response. He (Gan) asked whether Sato's policy was feasible. That was another question, but the Japanese military and political parties could not agree. He asked whether Sato's policy could ultimately be realized. Tajiri replied that the Japanese military and political parties did not agree, but there was no difference in diplomacy. He (Gan) asked whose initiative it was to hold talks in London to resolve the Far East problem. Tajiri replied that he was not very clear, but Britain was paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese issue and was trying to find a solution, but he had heard that there were no concrete discussions yet. At this point, Tajiri asked why the anti-Japanese sentiment in Guangxi had become more tense since last year. He (Gan) replied that this anti-Japanese upsurge was entirely the direct result of the North China and Suiyuan incidents. Tajiri also said that there was no reason why Japanese people were not allowed to live in Guangxi. Even the Japanese who had been running the Yueyangtang Pharmacy in Wuzhou for many years were ordered to leave the country by the Guangxi Provincial Government. Since last year, even Japanese tourists have not been allowed to enter, which is even more unreasonable. He (Gan) replied that the military and political authorities in Guangxi have a responsibility to protect foreigners. At present, the anti-Japanese sentiment among the people of Guangxi is very strong. They are afraid that it will be difficult to protect Japanese people after they enter the country. Therefore, there are these special measures. Tajiri asked whether Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren, whom he had met in Guangdong, advocated the recovery of the three northeastern provinces, and whether he still held this view now. He (Gan) replied that his position was the same as before and had not changed. Tajiri asked how the anti-Japanese movement in Guangxi could be calmed down. He (Gan) replied that this all depended on Japan's future policies.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Asks Liu Xiang to Implement Disaster Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Shanghai Circles Believe that Six Measures Are Fundamental Policies for Treatment and Aid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, yesterday, which read: "Chairman Liu of Chengdu, Fucheng Jianjian, this association, in order to allow all circles in Shanghai to thoroughly understand the true situation of the Sichuan disaster, held a tea party on the Zheng day to invite leaders from all walks of life. More than one hundred people attended, and Vice President Zhang Qun chaired the meeting to report on the detailed situation of the disaster-stricken counties in Sichuan Province and the six disaster relief measures advocated by the Nanjing Association. The whole audience spoke enthusiastically and expressed great sympathy, especially promoting the six measures, which are fundamental political policies. It was decided to expand the organization into the Shanghai All Circles Sichuan Disaster Relief Association. In addition to the president and vice president of this association as ex-officio members, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Song Hanzhang, Yu Zuoting, Qian Xinzhi, Qu Wenliu, Mu Ouchu, Wang Boqi, Yu Zhiqing, Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, and others were publicly elected as members, and preparations were made to establish it immediately in order to promote all disaster relief work. We believe that since people from the outside world are enthusiastically supporting us, all of us Sichuan people should be more actively involved, so that internal and external cooperation can achieve twice the result with half the effort. As the person in charge of Sichuan's political affairs, you have a heavy responsibility. The Nanjing Association has already sent the six measures to you by telegram. We hope that you will make separate donations and business conditions. Not only will more than 30 million disaster victims be taken care of, but also a great contribution will be made to the future of national rejuvenation. This telegram is specially sent to you, and your mother is not allowed to be in the camp. The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association is true."</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong and Others Telegraph That the Henan Disaster is Extremely Severe</h3>
<p>Dozens of Miles of Red Land Resemble a Desert; All Tree Bark and Grass Roots Have Been Stripped and Eaten, and Stone Powder is Being Chewed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation for Joint Disaster Relief received a telegram yesterday from Lu Bohong and others, directors of the Henan Investigation and Relief (titles omitted): "The disaster situation in Henan has recently become more serious. Because there are few people who have gone deep into the disaster area to inspect, the newspapers have not been able to fully disclose the situation. The people of the country pay little attention to it, so the donations are few. Alas, how can the people of Henan be saved? According to the original letter from Feng Denan, a member of the relief committee in Yichuan County, 'Directors Lu and Li, I went to the western highland area of the county on May 2 to investigate the disaster. For dozens of miles, the land was red, just like a desert. Among the low-lying canals, there were seedlings, but they were less than a foot tall, withered and thin, as if frosted. All the leaves and roots of trees, except those containing toxic juices, have been stripped and eaten. Along the way, the old and weak flocked to the Jin Peixia Hao Village area, digging for stones to eat. The stone grinders that have been made are carried with them and eaten. I went with the hungry people to inspect the stone production area. The area is an alluvial layer, and the stone is like soft whetstone, easy to chew. However, most of the disaster victims who chew stone powder have swollen abdomens and red and swollen faces. Those who have been eating stone powder for a long time have constipation and die one after another. On that day, there were more than 40 people mining stone powder here. They would rather die of suffocation than starve to death. I have traveled all over Europe and Asia and have never seen such a great disaster. I cried to the sky in pain, but there was no help. Shanghai is a place where the rich gather, and there have always been many people who are good at doing good. I respectfully ask you to forward this to the Shanghai General Assembly and urge them to do everything possible to appeal. Alas, the disaster victims are all our compatriots. Everyone is as good as I am. The disaster situation in Zhongzhou is probably not fully known to the other provinces, otherwise there will certainly be good people who will donate large amounts of money. Yichuan County is a county merged from Pingdeng and Ziyou counties. The transportation is inconvenient, and the investigation and relief are difficult. However, all investigation and relief negotiations have appropriate plans and should not have any omissions. However, there is too little porridge and too many monks, so we can only take care of one thing and lose sight of another. Witnessing the tragic situation, we have no choice but to report to the two sides, hoping that you will make a decision and copy the original letter and send it to the newspapers to fully disclose the situation and do everything possible to appeal, so that the disaster victims in the Henan province, which is a hell on earth, can have a glimmer of hope. We are extremely urgent and anxious.' Lu Bohong, Director of Henan Investigation and Relief, Li Shaoduo, Deputy Director."</p>

<h3>Returning Refugees from Spain Petition the Social Bureau</h3>
<p>Request Funding for Travel Expenses to Return to Their Hometowns; The Bureau Sends a Special Commissioner to Express Sympathy</p>
<p>Twenty-three Chinese refugees who fled the war in Spain and returned to China arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month, as reported in the newspapers. The refugees, in a difficult situation after fleeing the war and running out of funds, had previously gone to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to request relief but had not received any results. The refugees sent Xu Cuimei, Jiang Songlin, and Qiu Tingxun as representatives to continue to request relief from the Municipal Planning Committee yesterday morning with a petition. The bureau sent someone to receive them, accepted the petition, and agreed to discuss the matter with the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to send them back to their hometowns. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau subsequently sent Wang Fukun to discuss the repatriation method with the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday morning and then went to the Yuelai Inn on Dagu Road in the Sixteenth Pudong to express sympathy to the refugees. The refugees' petition stated, "Regarding the request for assistance, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, we lost all business and were short of food, almost becoming ghosts in a foreign land and never seeing our motherland and hometown again. We were sent back to our country, which is our rebirth. However, we have no money left after arriving in Shanghai from Spain and cannot return to our original Zhejiang Qing (Tian) hometown. If this continues, we will sit and wait for death. Therefore, we respectfully ask your bureau to forward our request to the government to show great compassion to save us from danger and to send us back to our hometowns to relieve us from our predicament. This is a great virtue. Presented to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>

<h3>Japanese-Dutch Trade Agreement to Be Established at the Expense of Our Country</h3>
<p>Japan Purchases Dutch Sugar and Compromises by Dumping Taiwan Sugar in China; Restricting Chinese Goods Exported to Dutch India Is the Only Purpose of the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Shenzhou News reports that since Mr. Kuwashima, representing the Japanese government, went south to Dutch India, the rumor of the establishment of a trade agreement between Japan and the Netherlands has spread to various countries, and there is a trend to sign and announce it within days. According to rumors from various sources, the only focus of the agreement is the issue of excluding Chinese goods. The Shenzhou News reporter, believing that this matter is of great importance, has inquired from various sources about the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Dutch India Has Always Had a Trade Surplus with Us</p>
<p>According to the investigation, Dutch India's trade with us has always had a trade surplus, and the difference between the two figures is often between ten and fifteen times. Dutch India's imports into our country are often around 10 million guilders per year, and sometimes more than 30 million guilders, while our country's exports to Dutch India are only about 2 million guilders per year. Although last year broke the record, it was only 5,991,000 guilders, which is still four times less than Dutch India's 23,196,000 guilders. Therefore, China is undoubtedly the best market for Dutch India. Our imports into Dutch India include cloth, food, groceries, porcelain, wool fabrics, stationery, books, canned food, paint, etc., while Dutch India's imports into our country are almost all sugar and oil.</p>
<p>Dutch India Has a Trade Deficit with Japan</p>
<p>However, Dutch India's trade with Japan is the opposite, with a trade deficit. In the past four years, Japanese goods have made rapid progress in the Dutch India market. In 1931, the total value was only 63,450 yuan, but it rose to 158,450 yuan last year. However, Dutch India's imports to Japan have been declining year by year since 1929. The only reason is that Dutch India's exports rely entirely on sugar, but after Japan successfully cultivated Taiwan sugar, it not only does not need to purchase Dutch sugar, but also uses smuggling and other methods to overwhelm the power of Dutch sugar in China. In the past, Dutch India adopted a quota system to resist Japan, but it had little effect. In the past two years, because Japan prepared for war and purchased and stored as much oil as possible, Dutch oil was able to be imported into Japan in large quantities, and the table gradually improved.</p>
<p>Planning an Agreement to Exclude Our Country</p>
<p>Dutch India's sugar production has been rejected by Taiwan. Now, the most important goods imported into Japan are sugar, oil, gasoline, iron, and rubber related to military use. Japan's imports into Dutch India are mainly cotton fabrics and rayon, followed by five-piece manufactured goods, ceramics, and glassware. However, Japan always believes that the measures promulgated by Dutch India hinder the sales of Japanese goods and strives to achieve the purpose of not hindering Japanese goods in the Nanyang market. After a long period of planning, it was decided to establish a trade agreement with Dutch India. The method it adopted was to purchase sugar produced in Dutch India and dump all of Taiwan's sugar in China, and to expand the Japanese goods market in Dutch India and restrict the import of Chinese goods. The compromise conditions held by Kuwashima on his trip south were to sacrifice China in order to obtain the conditions for cooperation between Japan and the Netherlands. In fact, the Dutch sugar market in China is huge. If Taiwan sugar is dumped, although it will gain a market in Japan, its original market in China will undoubtedly be rejected. Therefore, after the establishment of the Japanese-Dutch trade agreement, we will suffer losses, and Dutch India will also gain nothing, while Japan will benefit from it. Now, more than one million overseas Chinese in Dutch India believe that this agreement will destroy overseas Chinese merchants and domestic industry and commerce and have suggested to the country to re-negotiate a trade agreement with Dutch India in order to remedy the situation.</p>

This year's new tea has now been launched on the market. The first batch of boxed tea is produced in Huizhou Tunxi Suian and other places, totaling more than 560 boxes, which were declared and packed by Maoshun Tai at Zhakou Station on behalf of customers and transported to Shanghai by freight car last night.

<h3>Ningbo Native Association Appeals on Behalf of Fishermen Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discolored Salt Harms the Fishing Industry - Telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministry to Order a Halt</p>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating: "To the esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance: We respectfully report that the people of the coastal counties of Zhejiang Province mostly rely on fishing for their livelihood, and those from Ningbo constitute a significant portion. In recent years, due to the impact of the rural economic downturn, fishing villages are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the plight of fishermen struggling to survive is beyond words. Since the government implemented the use of discolored salt for fishing last year, their hardship has intensified. Our association has repeatedly reported the situation. Zhejiang Province now has detailed measures for managing fishing salt, and the system of discoloring salt for impoverished fishermen should be halted immediately. Furthermore, Clause 1 of the measures for flavoring and discoloring fishing salt stipulates that the flavoring and discoloring should not contain toxicity, should not be detrimental to hygiene, and should not interfere with the preservation of goods. The impurities currently used for discoloring are nothing more than mixing in red soil, rice bran, or charcoal powder. After trial use, the following significant drawbacks have been discovered: ㊀ The product quality is poor, and the inherent flavor of the product is changed. ㊁ It is prone to spoilage. ㊂ It is unhygienic. As a result, the price of the product has decreased, and it is difficult to sell. Moreover, in order to improve aquatic products and compete in the fish sales market, countries around the world are striving for refined fishing salt, and none have used discolored fishing salt to degrade the product. Why is Zhejiang Province implementing this discolored fishing salt, which reduces the flavor of fish products, causes fish prices to plummet, and severely damages fish sales, while opening the door to the dumping of foreign fish? Furthermore, the regulations on fishing salt in the Songjiang and Huainan areas approved by the Ministry of Finance stipulate that the salt remaining on fishing boats that is suitable for edible purposes may be purchased by official salt depots. This shows that fishing salt in various areas is not discolored in reality. Only Zhejiang Province is the first to implement this, increasing the burden on fishermen and hindering fish sales. At a time when fishing villages are declining, the government is striving to protect and develop them. The discoloring system for impoverished fishermen should be halted immediately. If there are concerns about fishing salt being diverted for edible purposes, the focus should be on managing fishing salt, implementing official transportation and sales, and conducting a strict investigation of the amount of fish caught and the amount of salt used. The problem of diversion can be prevented. Witnessing the suffering of our fellow fishermen, our association is submitting this report once again, hoping that you will investigate and order the salt administration agencies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to immediately halt the discoloring system in order to alleviate the suffering of the people and benefit development. We await your urgent orders." The Committee Chairman of the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, Yu Hede, etc., respectfully bow.</p>
<h3>Land Seizure Measures</h3>
<p>According to the Land Administration Bureau's Agreed Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, in order to inform the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, regarding the Association's recommendation that creditors requesting the seizure of land, if able to identify the plot and be responsible for the seizure, even if the map, insurance, and number of plots are unclear, should be investigated by their authority or ordered the local land protector to report before the land registration book is organized and published, and that a reply was received approving the seizure. This has been notified to all members yesterday, the notification begins, "Based on the proposal by member Xu Zuoliang (omitted)..." After the Association sent a letter, the Land Bureau replied, stating that "Regarding the great letter from your Association, asking for assistance from the court in searching for and reporting map, insurance, and plot numbers when the court requests measurement and seizure of land owned by debtors by creditors, before the organization of land is completed and the land registration book is published, or ordering the local land protector to truthfully and thoroughly report, and not to refuse execution simply because the creditor does not know the map, insurance, and plot numbers. The Bureau measured and seized land according to the ten articles of the measures agreed upon with the Shanghai Local Court in July of the 23rd year, for all land within the scope of the city. As for land seizure certificates not approved by the court, because it is necessary to order the local land protector to investigate and report, or to send a letter to the court to announce the cancellation, there is no delay because of this. However, regarding the measurement section, if the creditor can accurately point out the location of the debtor's property and not be rejected because the creditor does not know the map, insurance, and plot numbers, a copy of the measures is attached for reference. "The joint meeting of the 243rd Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Association decided to report to the courts and forward these kinds of land seizure events to the Municipal Land Administration Bureau for investigation and processing, and notify all members to be aware of it. The corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will take note."</p>

<h3>Chinese Constable Induces a Minor Girl</h3>
<p>The Case Has Been Concluded and is Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Li Juduo, a Chinese constable number 686 from the Songshan Road Police Station in the French Concession, is 21 years old and unmarried. Because he often worked near the Killing Company on Route des Soeurs, he became acquainted with Dai Genlin, also known as Gen Di, the 16-year-old daughter of Dai Xiaodi, a Suzhou native living at 49 Tongkang Lane, across from the Killing Company. Later, he enticed the girl into an illicit relationship. On the 30th of last month, he even induced the girl to run away privately and hide at 5 Manufacturing Bureau Road in Southern Shanghai, hoping to live together as permanent companions. After the girl's escape, her father searched everywhere for her without success. Later, he found a photograph of Li, wearing his uniform, given to the girl in her wardrobe, which provided a clue. He reported it to the French Police Station, which dismissed and arrested Li, and recovered Dai Genlin, who was taken back by her family. Li was sent to the Special No. 3 Court, where the Police Department's lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of disrupting a family under Article 240, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After the trial by Judge Chen Shuoying, the debate had already concluded and was scheduled for sentencing yesterday morning. The girl was sent for a forensic examination, pending review. Because the forensic examination of Dai showed that her hymen had been ruptured long ago, and she had engaged in adultery more than once, and both the girl and the defendant denied having committed adultery during the court hearing, the presiding judge, believing that the case was not clear, summoned the enticed Dai Genlin and her father, Dai Xiaodi, to the court yesterday morning, and brought the defendant to reopen the debate in Criminal Court No. 1. Dai then confessed to having had a relationship with the defendant at the Chunjiang Hotel once. The defendant still denied it. The judge asked the girl's father if he was filing a statement with the court to withdraw the charges, and he replied, "Yes." The judge then instructed that the case was not a case that could be withdrawn, and ordered the start of the debate. After the court announced the conclusion, the defendant was ordered to be remanded in custody pending instruction, and the defendant requested bail, which the court denied. The bailiffs took him away to be detained.</p>

<h3>Murderer Found to Be Suffering From Mental Illness</h3>
<p>Police Lawyer Requests Commuted Sentence - Case Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing on the 14th</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th of last month, around 6:00 AM, an unknown man of about 16 or 17 years old, a dock coolie, was struck in the back of the head with a hard wooden stick in front of Warehouse No. 2 of the China Merchants Bureau Wharf on the French Concession Bund. His brain matter splattered out, and he died instantly. The French police arrested the assailant, Jiang Xianzhou (53 years old, from Hebei), and sent him to the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution. The assailant, who suffers from mental illness, had an episode during the court hearing, holding the hard wooden stick presented by the police as evidence and attempting to strike the bystanders. The bailiffs stopped him, and the court ordered a review of the autopsy report before further questioning. This was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the defendant, Jiang Xianzhou, was confirmed to be suffering from mental illness after a forensic examination. The police also found that Jiang had worked in Russia and returned to China due to mental illness. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he was sent to a mental hospital by the Public Security Bureau for treatment and then sent back to his hometown. Later, he came to Shanghai again, which led to his vagrancy. Yesterday afternoon, when Judge Chen Shuoying continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1, fearing that Jiang would have another episode, the forensic doctor shackled both of his hands to the wooden railing of the defendant's stand. First, Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer from the Police Department, explained the police investigation. When questioned, Jiang confessed that he was from Fucheng County, Hebei, and had an old father, Jiang Zhenhuan. He suffered from illness due to family disputes. When asked why he killed someone and when he returned from Russia and was sent to the hospital by the Public Security Bureau, he said he did not know. Then, Chen Xuegui, who ran a food stall at the wharf, testified about the defendant's crime of killing someone, and said that the deceased was indeed a coolie, and no one had come looking for him so far. At this point, the court considered the facts of the case to be clear and ordered the start of the debate. The Police Department lawyer stated that according to the defendant's crime, he should be charged with murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. However, it has been determined that the defendant suffers from mental illness and should be exempt from punishment or have his sentence reduced in accordance with the law. Subsequently, Zhao Yifan, a student judge designated by the court to defend the defendant, made a statement. The court announced the conclusion and ordered that the defendant be remanded in custody pending sentencing on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau to Move to New Location</h3>
<p>Old Site to Be Converted into a Savings Association</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, established by the Central Bank with an investment of ten million yuan, handles businesses such as material procurement trust, insurance, and safekeeping. It also has an affiliated Central Savings Association to promote public thrift. Over the past year and a half, its various businesses have been thriving. Previously, the premises at 13 Han口Road were insufficient, and additional premises at 115 Han口Road and 7 Bund were leased as offices. However, this caused inconvenience, so the building at 6 Bund, which the bank had leased to a large bank, was taken back upon the expiration of the lease, renovated, and used as the new headquarters of the Bureau. The project has now been completed, and the Bureau is preparing to arrange its furniture and equipment. Once the newly appointed director, Li Guochin, takes office, the Bureau will move in. The old site at 31 Hankou Road will be used as the headquarters of the Central Savings Association. The Central Bank is being reorganized into the Central Reserve Bank, and its organizational law has not yet been promulgated. It is rumored that the Trust Bureau will be directly under the Ministry of Finance. In addition, the Qujiang Wharf operated by the Bureau has been completed and will be put into operation at the beginning of next month, and an opening ceremony is scheduled.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Commits Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>Drowned in the Yangtze River at Huangshi Port Aboard the Longxing</p>
<p>The Three North Company's Yangtze River express boat Longxing departed from Shanghai for Wuhan on Saturday night of last week with many passengers. In the second-class cabin, Room 10, there was a passenger who carried many pieces of luggage. At first, there was nothing unusual about him. However, at 3:00 PM on the 10th, when the boat passed Jiujiang and arrived on the Yangtze River at Huangshi Port, the passenger suddenly took advantage of the inattention of others and jumped into the river. This happened during the day, and the crew members immediately reported it to the shipowner, who stopped the boat and turned back to the Yangtze River. A sampan was quickly dispatched, and sailors and tea boys were sent to conduct the search. At 3:10 PM, the passenger was found, but he had already died. At that time, the crew members examined his luggage and found no suicide note. Only a letter of guarantee was found, which revealed that his name was Xu Yunqiao, and he was an employee of the Sichuan Jiangfeng Bank who was going to Hankou from Shanghai. The letter of guarantee was issued by Geng Guanghua of the Guangweixin Store in Beigaoyang Lane on Nanjing Road in Shanghai and was given to Xu to carry to Hankou. The Longxing then handed over the deceased's luggage and other items to the Jiujiang branch of the Three North Company. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Shanghai yesterday morning, reporting to the Shanghai headquarters and requesting that Geng Guanghua of Beigaoyang Lane be notified as soon as possible to go to Xun to handle the transfer of the deceased's coffin and receive the luggage. Yesterday, the Three North Company copied the Longxing's telegram and showed it to Geng Guanghua.</p>

The thieves were fast asleep and caught off guard, and five men and women were arrested on the spot. An eight-inch pistol and a magazine were seized. One thief escaped from the roof of the Qianjiang Guild Hall. The Western detectives fired more than ten shots, but the thief still escaped.

<h3>Abbot of Longhua Temple Sued for Debt</h3>
<p>Fourteen Plaintiffs, Debt of One Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Longhua Temple is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai, the Bao'en Temple built by Sun Quan of the Eastern Wu, so it has a seven-story pagoda, a pure dojo, and a solemn forest, which can be called a scenic spot in Jiangnan. However, it has become a source of lawsuits over the years. Every abbot has been subject to litigation. Like Yuanzhao, Xingkong, Yuanming, and the current Shengqin (Yuanming), they fought each other, and the case has not yet been closed. The current abbot, Shengqin, and the supervisor (the steward), Xinghui, and the deputy abbot (the accountant), Zhengqing, and Yuanming, etc., were sued by fourteen merchants for owing more than 3,000 yuan, including the plaintiff for the Xinjile Qiyin Stationery Store owner Jin Zhigang, Yishengtang Medicine Store Yu Sizhong, Hu Santai Brick and Tile Shop Hu Jintao, Wu Yihe Tofu Store Wu Jisheng, Ruikang Sauce Garden Zhang Ruinian, Yang Hengmao Rice Store Yang Haigen, Wu Shunxing Tofu Store Wu Jianchun, Shuntai Timber Shop Chuan Chubao, Zhangchang Dry Goods Store Shen Daquan, Yeshunji Wood Shop Yang Liansheng, Wang Xiejil Lacquer Shop owner Wang Maoyi, Yongmaode Porcelain Shop Xu Jiquan, Huang Yongshun Iron Shop Huang Debao, and Jiangbei resident Hua Laowu's additional loan of 150 yuan, totaling fourteen households, have jointly hired lawyer Fang Gang to sue in the local court. The main points are that they have gradually purchased on credit, relying on the income from the March pilgrimage to repay, but the pilgrimage has passed, and the income is considerable, but they have not paid a penny. They request the court to order joint and several repayment. Yesterday, Judge Chuan Lan opened the court. The plaintiff testified about the previous situation, and lawyer Fang detailed the amount of each household. The defendants who arrived were the monks Zhengqing and Yuanming. Zhengqing admitted to owing debt but did not borrow, but was not detailed. Yuanming said that he was the abbot before, and now Shengqin is the abbot, so the person responsible should be Shengqin and Xinghui. The court then rescheduled the hearing for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Abandonment After Seduction and Endangerment of Public Morality</h3>
<p>Zhang Huisun Already Has a Wife; Li Huijun Sues Him in Court</p>
<p>Li Huijun, a woman from Ningbo, 21 years old, was introduced by a female acquaintance to Zhang Huisun, the newly appointed comprador of a certain shipping company (resident at 5 Shangmei New Lane, Longmen Road), around March of last year. At the time, Zhang claimed to be unmarried and willing to spend his life with Li. They then rented a house and lived together, initially at No. 1 Junle Lane, Weihaiwei Road, for about three months, and then moved to No. 398 New Dagu Road. During their cohabitation, Li repeatedly urged Zhang to marry her, but Zhang always made vague promises. However, to reassure Li, he wrote her a note in September of last year. But in December of last year, Zhang made an excuse to leave and never returned, abandoning Li as if she were worn-out shoes and cutting off her financial support, leaving her deeply in debt. Recently, through a female detective's investigation, it was revealed that Zhang already had a wife and that all his previous actions were merely his skills in toying with women. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhang for endangering public morals, and also filed a civil suit, demanding a payment of 10,000 yuan. This case was heard yesterday afternoon in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Xiao Xiefen of the First Special District Court. The subpoena to the defendant Zhang Huisun was not received because his family refused to accept it, so he did not appear in court. Li then submitted a statement of the circumstances and requested that he be punished according to the law. Judge Xiao, after reviewing the evidence, adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Major Fire on Tianbao Road, Zhabei, Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Over Seventy Thatched Houses Burned Down; 337 Households Affected</p>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out at around 1:45 p.m. yesterday in the thatched houses behind Jun'an Lane on Tianbao Road, Derun Road, Zhabei, in the home of Liu Xiaodong, a native of Yancheng who worked as a servant for a Westerner in the Tilanqiao area of the Public Concession. Dense smoke immediately filled the air, quickly turning into a conflagration, with the fire spreading rapidly. It immediately spread to the homes of Bi, Zou, Wu, and Zhu, and the fire became intense, quickly spreading to the nearby thatched houses, making it difficult to control. Upon receiving the alarm, the various firefighting brigades of Zhabei rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the fire. However, because the thatched houses were densely packed together and the roads were winding and narrow, firefighting efforts were difficult. The thatched house area was bounded by Shahong Road to the east, Tianbao Road to the south, Tiande Road to the west, and Derun Road to the north, with neighborhoods blocking access on all sides. Therefore, they focused their efforts on the Derun Road entrance, and the fire was brought under control after continuous efforts until about 2:30 p.m. Before long it was totally extinguished, but all the thatched houses there were completely burned down, totaling over seventy. The affected households numbered 337. The surrounding neighborhoods were spared from the fire due to the effective firefighting efforts. When the fire was raging, Zhao Xiaolin, a native of Changzhou, was fast asleep in a thatched house after drinking too much alcohol at lunch. A firefighter spotted him and bravely rushed into the fire to rescue him, preventing him from being burned. However, two firefighters, Zhu Xueming and Wang Shanhe, were injured when they fell from a ladder while fighting the fire, suffering severe injuries to their arms, legs, and heads. They were taken to Tongren and Renji Hospitals for treatment. The cause of the fire was that Liu Xiaodong, the initial source, had cooked lunch at home and then left without extinguishing the fire, causing the tragedy. The police have detained Liu Xiaodong and Wu Zhu, the originators of the fire, at the Linping Road Police Station for interrogation. When the fire broke out, the residents in the area immediately moved their belongings and tried to escape. The scene was filled with the cries of mothers and children, a tragic scene. This disaster has caused a great loss, but the affected residents are all poor laborers with nowhere to go, lingering on the streets, waiting for assistance from the city's charitable organizations.</p>
<h3>Mistaken Identity: Homecomer Assaulted in the Dead of Night</h3>
<p>Cries for Help; Father Also Injured</p>
<p>At Xingshantang of Zongshan Road, Xietu Road, in western Shanghai, an incident of mistaken identity leading to an assault on innocent people occurred at around 10 p.m. the night before last. Only after the fact did the attackers realize their mistake, but both father and son had already suffered injuries all over their bodies. Here is a record of what happened: Wang Cailang, a rickshaw puller from Chongming, 22 years old, and his father, Wang Xiaosi, 56 years old, rent a place at Xingshantang on Zongshan Road. The father is a peddler, and the son makes a living pulling rickshaws. They have always been law-abiding and do not get involved in outside affairs. At 10 p.m. the night before last, Cailang was returning home from work when, just as he was approaching his home, more than a dozen strong men suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and began beating him without reason. Cailang was caught off guard and unable to escape, so he cried out for help. His father, who was waiting for his son's return, rushed out upon hearing the cries, only to be surrounded and punched and kicked by the men before he could even get close. They beat them both until they were lying on the ground, and then fled in all directions. The residence is located in a quiet area, and it was late at night, so there was no way to call the police. The father and son had no choice but to crawl back home in pain. At dawn, they reported the incident to the local police station and requested an investigation. However, the truth gradually became clear, and it was revealed to be a case of mistaken identity. Wang Cailang has suffered serious injuries and is unable to work. His elderly father is even more frail, and in addition to internal injuries, his entire body is covered in cuts and bruises, and he is barely breathing. It is now heard that the perpetrators, realizing the severity of the injuries, feel deeply sorry and have secretly asked someone to intercede with the victims, offering to pay for medical expenses and treatment. However, Xiao Wang is old and seriously injured, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Yang Binggen Shot and Killed in Robbery; Corpse Examined</h3>
<p>Yang Binggen, a 25-year-old native of Liyang who ran a small restaurant at No. 10 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, was walking with his wife, Yang Xu, around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday to the Chenghuang Temple, when suddenly, on Yuyuan Road in the Nanshi area, a bandit attempted to steal a gold bracelet from a woman walking on the street. Yang, upon seeing this, immediately stepped forward and grabbed the robber. Unexpectedly, the robber had a pistol, which accidentally fell to the ground and was picked up by his accomplice, who fired three shots at Yang, one hitting him in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground. The robbers, realizing they had committed a crime, fled in different directions. When the police on patrol arrived, they immediately took Yang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 5:15 p.m. The hospital reported this to the Laozha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the autopsy center on Peilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang of the First Special District Court also confirmed that the deceased died from a gunshot wound. The body was released to his wife, Yang Xu, to be claimed for burial.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Introduces International Trade to Embassies and Consulates</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday issued an instruction to various domestic goods organizations in the city, stating: "Based on the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Commercial Document No. 94977, it is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously issued a dispatch stating that, based on a request from the Swedish Embassy, all requests from domestic export manufacturers for assistance with trade matters from overseas embassies and consulates should be reviewed and forwarded by the competent authorities. The Ministry has already issued Instruction No. 54084 on the 3rd of this month to the Bureau, instructing all manufacturers to comply. Now, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram on April 14th, stating that Article 2, Section 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that 'the introduction and guidance of international trade matters' is one of the statutory functions of the Chamber of Commerce. It is requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs be requested to instruct the Swedish Embassy that requests for introduction submitted by the Chamber of Commerce should be treated the same as those submitted by the International Trade Bureau in order to comply with the law. After review, the request in the original telegram is feasible. In addition to issuing a dispatch to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct all overseas embassies and consulates to comply, the Bureau is also instructed to inform all manufacturers. This order is hereby issued to the Association for information, and to instruct all manufacturers to take note."</p>

<h3>Artillery Shell Found Under Wall at Yizhixiang</h3>
<p>The Yizhixiang Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road recently underwent renovations because the original furnishings were outdated. Yesterday morning at around 10:30, when a plasterer was demolishing an old wall, he suddenly discovered a small artillery shell underneath the wall. The restaurant immediately reported this to the police, who dispatched a team to investigate and took the shell back to the police station for safekeeping pending further investigation.

<h3>Chinese Buddhist Association Ordered to Restrict Monks from Traveling Abroad</h3>
<p>Those Who Wish to Go Must Have Round-Trip Travel Expenses to Avoid Begging Along the Way and Being Despised</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs issued an instruction to the Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday, stating that it was to comply with the order of the municipal government to restrict monks from traveling abroad. The order stated: "Based on Letter No. 188 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 13, 1937, the Consulate in Rangoon reported that Burma and Myanmar are Buddhist holy lands, and pilgrims from all over the world come to worship throughout the year. Abbots of temples in various provinces of China have also heard of the holy lands and come to visit. With the exception of a small number who come purely for pilgrimage and to study Buddhist doctrines, the majority take the opportunity to beg everywhere. Not only are they unable to achieve good results, but they are also despised. Recently, many Chinese monks have begged their way from China to Rangoon, and due to differences in customs and the decline of the Chinese community's prosperity, they have been unable to raise funds. Unable to move forward or backward, they are in dire straits, which is very pitiful. In view of this, the Consulate suggests that the Ministry should instruct passport issuing agencies to ensure that monks traveling to Burma or India in the future have sufficient round-trip travel expenses and that their credentials are verified before they are allowed to leave the country. This will not only prevent monks from experiencing difficulties but also reduce the contempt and aversion of Chinese and foreigners towards Chinese monks. All reasons for the difficulties encountered by Chinese monks begging in Rangoon and the intention to restrict them in the future are hereby submitted for your review and approval. After review, the suggestions of the Consulate regarding restrictions on monks traveling to Burma or India seem feasible in order to prevent various difficulties and wandering abroad. In addition to issuing separate instructions, we hereby request that you take note and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly." The same was instructed to the Bureau of Police. The same instruction is given to the Buddhist Association, and all temples and monks are instructed to comply.</p>

<h3>Tobacco and Coin Exchange Industry Notifies Fellow Merchants</h3>
<p>Limited Supply of Copper Auxiliary Coins; Increasingly Difficult to Exchange, Gradually Discontinued</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Coin Exchange Industry Association issued a notice yesterday stating: "In regards to the exchange of one-cent copper coins, the demand from various merchants has suddenly increased recently, while the supply is limited, resulting in insufficient supply. The Central Bank has notified that the number of coins produced by the mint is limited, and the demand from various places has suddenly increased, resulting in insufficient distribution. Therefore, the original amount (50 boxes) has been reduced by 10 boxes, and only 40 boxes will be issued each period. The amount registered by each merchant is far from sufficient, leading to disputes at each exchange period, and making it difficult for the Association to handle matters. Therefore, the previous decision is reiterated: from today onwards, coin exchanges for small shops will be temporarily suspended, and only member merchants will be limited to exchange based on the amount received each period, to ensure fairness and avoid disputes. This notice is hereby issued so that all merchants are informed."</p>

<h3>Zhali, Engineer of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, Returns to His Home Country</h3>
<p>Zhali (English name), the chief engineer of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, has served in the Bureau for 20 years. Due to family reasons, he has tendered his resignation to the Director of the Bureau and returned to his home country, which was approved. He handed over his duties on the 1st of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., Mr. Zhali boarded the British ship "Laumpra" (transliteration) to return to his home country. The Chinese and foreign staff of the Bureau, who had worked with Mr. Zhali for many years, went to the pier to see him off. Mr. Zhali was extremely grateful. According to the Chinese secretary of the Bureau, Mr. Zhali has a 70-year-old mother at home who lacks care. He sent his wife back to his home country two years ago to care for her. However, Mr. Zhali constantly missed his mother as she grew older and felt it was unfilial for a son not to be able to serve her personally. He resolutely resigned this time, and attempts to persuade him to stay were unsuccessful. His filial piety is admirable and truly rare.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Robbery of the Li Shun Steamboat Solved; Robbers and Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>Reported by the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Water Police Bureau to the Lake Society</p>
<p>Previously, the Lake Society received a letter from the Inland River Steamboat Industry Association reporting that the Li Shun merchant steamboat, owned by the Lake Company, was robbed in Fengxiangfudang, Jiashan County, on April 21. It immediately appointed personnel to contact the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to investigate and arrest the robbers. It is now heard that the company has received a letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Water Police Bureau reporting that on the 1st of this month, the 4th squad, led by Captain Bao Yuxing, arrested notorious bandits Pan Wanshun, Guo Wanming, and Sun Wengui in Shanghai, along with eleven guns, over four hundred rounds of ammunition, and stolen goods.

The swift resolution of this case has deterred bandits. Inland river navigation should now be safer.</p>
<h3>The Lianqing Society Will Hold Another Charity Social Gathering</h3>
<p>Nine Hundred Valuable Prizes Prepared for Raffle; Many Song and Dance Experts to Add to the Fun</p>
<p>Nine years ago, the Shanghai Lianqing Society founded the Lianqing Children's Clinic in Wuzhen Road, Zhabei. Last year, the number of patients reached more than 12,000, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. The annual operating expenses of 3-4,000 yuan are mostly borne by the members of the society. In mid-June of last year, the society held a charity social gathering to raise funds to establish children's sports fields in Zhongshan Road and its civilian village in America. Two sports instructors were hired to teach everything, so that poor children and adults could get regular entertainment with excellent results. This year, another charity social gathering will be held at the Paramount Hotel on the evening of May 19 at 8 o'clock to raise funds. In addition to these two good deeds, it is also planned to set up a vocational school scholarship for the youth club and donate to the Hudong School to promote vocational education so that young people can receive practical vocational training and become self-reliant after graduation. A 1937 Northern Electric refrigerator, a wireless Hammes portable typewriter, a Anmins Sanyong bed, a Dahua Chloros sofa, a Dunlop Biller mat, and 900 other prizes will be available for raffle. One purchase ticket is also a raffle ticket, so there is hope of winning a prize. In addition, music and dance experts will be hired to provide excellent entertainment. People who participate can have fun and win prizes, as well as help poor people. It is truly a win-win situation. All the tickets are sold by the members of the society, and there is a great deal of enthusiasm for reserving seats. Those who wish to participate and assist in good deeds are kindly requested to reserve seats at the Shandong Road United Advertising Company, the Jing'an Temple Road Northern Electric Company, and the Guangdong Road Palm Company to avoid disappointment.</p>
<h3>Woman Liu Cuibao Sues Lover for Abortion</h3>
<p>Mrs. Liu, a woman from Taicang residing at No. 9 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession, has a daughter named Liu Cuibao, who is 20 years old. She is betrothed but not yet married. With her heart opening to love, she found it difficult to live without a companion in her unmarried state. Wang Junfu, the son of her landlady, Wang Fei, was also a young man. They spent their days together, fostering seeds of love. Taking advantage of their proximity, they engaged in secret affairs. Unexpectedly, an unwanted pregnancy resulted. By last month, she was already two months along, experiencing morning sickness. Realizing the trouble, the woman consulted with Wang Fei, and together they went to midwife Ye Yu (age 70) at No. 197 Guangqi Road in the city to have an abortion. They paid twelve yuan. With a herbal medicine inserted into her lower body, a blood clot was expelled. She returned home immediately, but the bloodstains were discovered by her mother, leading to a major dispute. Negotiations failed, and the police were called, detaining Wang Fei, Ye Yu, and Liu Cuibao, and handing them over to the District Court for prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Lu opened the court. Liu Cuibao confessed the crime of Wang Fei and Ye Yu, taking the blame upon herself, claiming she had sought help on her own, without others' involvement. Wang Fei claimed that the woman's mother was trying to use her daughter as a money-making tool, having already paid sixty yuan, but she demanded a thousand yuan, hence the accusation. Ye Yu claimed she did not receive any money and performed the abortion out of moral kindness, preserving the woman's marriage prospects. Attorney Pan Zhensheng defended them, requesting leniency. After the court's debate concluded, the verdict will be announced on the 15th. All defendants were ordered to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Gu Maoxing Factory Manager Sues Workers Again</h3>
<p>Workers Gu Jinan, Lu Hongsheng, Zhu Afu, Chen Guoliang, Sun Quanshan, etc. of Gu Maoxing Silk Weaving Factory at No. 644 Xiexu Road were previously sued by the factory manager Lu Bingsheng in the District Court for locking the factory and going on strike, obstructing freedom. Judge Yu Lude found insufficient evidence in court and declared them innocent, but warned them to be law-abiding. Now, one wave has subsided, and another rises. Lu Bingsheng again sued Gu Jinan, Lu Hongsheng, Zhu Afu, Chen Guoliang, Sun Quanshan, etc. in the District Court for obstructing freedom and intimidation. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court to hear the case. Lu Bingsheng did not attend, entrusting the accountant Jin Yufu to present the case. The manager was called to the General Labor Union today to mediate the matter. A motion to withdraw the case was made, but the court ruled that it could not be withdrawn and proceeded according to law. It was stated that on April 30, after they came out of your court, at 8:30 PM, they questioned Lu why he did not attend court, accusing him of wanting to put them in jail. Gu Jinan immediately called all the workers to beat Lu, injuring his back, etc. The police were called to take Gu Jinan to the Ximen Branch Bureau. The next day, it was reported in the newspaper that the defendant was acquitted due to Lu's absence. Therefore, this lawsuit was filed. Gu Jinan testified that Lu Bingsheng was talking to the accountant that night and was about to leave the factory, so he went to him to ask for wages and to check the goods to avoid shortages, which they could not afford. Lu then pretended to sleep in the storeroom and claimed that he was beaten. Therefore, he was taken to the Ximen Branch Bureau to persuade him to reconcile, but he did not hit him at all. All the defendants testified that they were at the labor union that day and not at the factory, so they did not know about the dispute. They are all representatives, and Gu is the chief representative, so he is deliberately making false accusations. The court ordered the plaintiff to appear in court for questioning next time, and the defendants were released on bail.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marine Corps Transport Vehicles Collide, Causing Damage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at approximately 2:10 PM, eight transport vehicles of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai were speeding from the Bund on Nanjing Road from east to west.

As a result, two headlights, the engine cylinder, water tank, and fenders of Vehicle No. 21 were completely damaged and rendered inoperable. Traffic was immediately disrupted for half an hour. Indian police officer No. 577, upon hearing the news, arrived to maintain order and, together with the driver, Tsugawa, managed to push the damaged vehicle from the entrance of the San You Industrial Company to the entrance of the Wing On Company on Zhejiang Road, recording the vehicle number as S.D.F. 86. At approximately 3:00 PM, the Japanese Marine Corps was informed and dispatched a locomotive to tow the damaged vehicle back for repairs.</p>

<h3>Strange Japanese People Discovered on Japanese Ships for Several Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun," a Japanese boy named Ogura Kazuhiro, who arrived on the Rokko Maru on the 8th, behaved very strangely. After being questioned by the police of the Consulate General, he replied, "I want to meet Chiang Kai-shek," with high spirits. He was immediately taken to the Consulate and detained. The boy is originally from Shiga Prefecture and is a printing worker. He usually likes to read "Kodansha Magazine." Because the magazine recorded the inside story of the international city of Shanghai, he rashly came to Shanghai. The local Japanese authorities decided to send him back to his country on the Shanghai Maru today (the 12th). Also, when the Ikoma Maru arrived on the 9th, Ohara Etsuro, a man from Hokkaido, was also detected by the Japanese police. When asked why he came to Shanghai, he replied that in addition to studying Chinese economic issues, he also needed to investigate the current situation of the Japanese Embassy and Consulate. His wording was particularly peculiar, and he is currently being held at the Consulate.</p>

<h3>"Taking Confessions with a Gramophone"</h3>
<p>— Hong Fa</p>
<p>The invention of many tools probably stems from a real need at first! Over time, when applied, they go beyond that purely beneficial boundary and are used by humans for enjoyment and games. For example, the purpose of manufacturing airplanes is to supply military use, but after a long time, humans will think of using them for sky tours: the invention of radio is a powerful tool for long-distance communication, and humans can also use it to receive sound and have fun... and so on.</p>
<p>As for the gramophone, I don't know what its use is in foreign countries? In our country, since its import, it has been used as a tool for entertainment, to play records after tea and wine. Unexpectedly, some people are now using it for litigation and evidence.</p>
<p>According to reports: "Fan Peien, judge of the civil division of the Third Branch of the High Court, was hearing an appeal case on the return of land prices between Wu Hongda et al. and Wu Hongde et al. at the third court of the court at around 4 pm on the 7th of this month. The appellant used the method of audio recording to turn the situation of the appellee’s oral obscuring of the court outside into a record and present it to the court. Judge Fan opened the gramophone in court, and the truth of the case was broadcast."</p>
<p>This matter seems ordinary, but because of this move, not only can the losing party obtain a final victory due to the establishment of new evidence, but it is especially noteworthy that it has a significant impact on society. From today on, if there is discord or secret hatred between people, no matter who their opponent is, they will be terrified, and they will be very hesitant to speak during conversations, or they may simply remain silent. The reason is that if they are a little careless, they suspect that the opponent they are talking to can secretly record everything they talk about. The result of doing so is that even if it is not necessary for future litigation and evidence collection, if the words and deeds are slightly inconsistent, they will inevitably be blamed for contradicting themselves.</p>
<p>Isn't it? In the past, some famous novelists, because the characterizations in their works were extremely vivid and realistic, many people were afraid of being written into his works and leaving a stain, so they deliberately avoided meeting him. From this example, then my overthinking above may become a real fact.</p>
<p>As for my own private opinion: I still want to apply this invention to a wider range. Not only can civilians use it to take confessions, but some politicians, when they are in opposition, make high-sounding remarks to the people to save the country—because this is also a "confession"—we will record them using audio recording methods, and wait for them to return to the political stage in the future, and then see if their actions and facilities are suitable for the statements made to the sun? Or completely contradictory? And decide our belief in him based on that. Because his "confession" is in fact "heard" by someone. That is countless hundreds of millions of people. Doing so is not only a higher application of "taking confessions with a gramophone," but the effect is even more far-reaching.</p>
<h3>Watching the Fun</h3>
<p>— Wu Cun</p>
<p>It is May, the year of Dingchou, and the Shanghai Racecourse is holding the coronation ceremony of King George VI. Because there were too many people attending, advance tickets were sold to show restrictions, and ticket prices were divided into several types, such as five yuan, two yuan, and one yuan. According to the newspaper, all the more than 50,000 seats were sold out in advance: the rooms in the International, New World... and other hotels along the racecourse were also sold out two weeks in advance.</p>
<p>Who is so enthusiastic? The newspaper did not mention it. But we may as well predict that although the coronation is of the British Emperor and the ceremony is far away in Britain, at least two-thirds of those who go to the racecourse to watch the ceremony and reserve hotel rooms to watch the ceremony are our descendants of the Yellow Emperor.</p>
<p>Most of the ants of China are eagerly waiting for governance, hoping that they will no longer be "robbed" and "secured," and eat a mouthful of hard food peacefully. But the idle people of China are worried that there is no fun to watch.</p>
<p>They watch when people hold funerals; they watch when people welcome their relatives. They stand there dumbly on the street for an hour or two, watching and praising, criticizing. When the police on the road beat the rickshaw drivers, a large crowd of onlookers usually surrounds them, lost and dazed, as if they are admiring some work of art. When the beaten man is in a panic, they find it interesting and laugh beside them.</p>
<p>They also watch car accidents that ruin children with the same indifference. When the Western police officer's stick hits them and they hear the shouts of "Go, go, go! Look at nothing!" they suddenly wake up from their dreams, scratching their heads and running away dejectedly to watch the fun elsewhere. They never resist being beaten by sticks, because resistance will inevitably lead to conflict, and they will be trapped in the center, allowing others to watch the fun.</p>
<p>Shooting a kidnapper always attracts tens of thousands of spectators, and the road is blocked. When a fire breaks out in a neighboring village and the cries are earth-shattering, the spectators are delighted.</p>
<p>If they have money, their desire to appreciate the fun is even stronger and broader. Whether they spend money or not, they participate in all the fun, but only if they are not involved in any trouble. If things are a little unstable, they hurry home, close the door tremblingly, and hide. When the danger is over, they come out to watch and have fun.</p>
<p>The drought in western Henan is severe, and tens of thousands of refugees are waiting to die. Apart from those gentlemen who regard "charity" as a "career," who would voluntarily donate a little? The tickets to watch the foreign devils' celebration ceremony have already been sold out, and the hotel rooms have been sold out. But if the disaster areas of western Henan can be moved to Shanghai X World for public exhibition and open for people to visit, then selling tickets will probably not be a problem. People who love to watch the fun do not ask about celebrations and funerals. Watching other people's disasters is also a kind of entertainment for them. As the saying goes, "Watching the fire from across the river."</p>
<p>Sometimes, they simply watch the fire in their own home. It is said that when Shenyang fell and the Japanese army paraded in the streets, there were still idlers (naturally Chinese) standing and watching with their mouths open. The Japanese newspaper the next day said, "The Imperial Army passed by, and the welcomers lined the streets, praising the Empire's military prestige."</p>
<p>But what if the tickets and hotel rooms are all gone? — It's okay to "squeeze into the crowds" on the road. After being crowded and bumped into for most of the night, they returned home inexplicably, sweating profusely, and said to their wives: "When the British Emperor ascended the throne, there were mountains of people, and several children and women were crushed. It was really good to have fun."</p>
<h3>"Hindenburg" Airship Accident</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>The German airship "Hindenburg," which travels over the Atlantic Ocean, suddenly exploded and caught fire on the 6th of this month, with fifty people killed among the one hundred passengers! According to the announcement by the semi-official circles in the United States, the cause of the accident was the use of hydrogen instead of helium (note: hydrogen is flammable, while helium is not). The explosion was caused by the explosion of hydrogen. When the ship first flew across the Atlantic last May, former captain Dr. Eckler advocated purchasing helium to avoid danger. At that time, the United States originally intended to supply it fully, but the German government banned the export of current funds and failed to pay the price of the goods and stopped. (It is found that the only natural helium producing areas in the world are the United States and Canada). Although factories are set up elsewhere to extract helium, the cost is very high. Therefore, the "Hindenburg" used hydrogen instead of helium, which ultimately led to this explosion.</p>
<p>The "Hindenburg" held its maiden voyage in May last year, and completed its 1936 flight schedule by October last year. When she set sail in the spring, the Zeppelin Company claimed to complete ten round trips within the specified time.</p>

<h3>Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezhi</p>
<p>Eighteen</p>
<p>When Sai Jinhua arrived, Beijing was once again struck in her heart by a major attack. Some of the relatives and friends she wanted to go to were killed by the Qing court for communicating with foreigners; some fled to distant places, leaving her empty-handed. Sai Jinhua was in a dilemma, but fortunately, there were compassionate people everywhere. An old man walked out of the crowd and generously invited her to his home to settle down.</p>
<p>There were different opinions on this point about the transatlantic voyage between Europe and the United States. Some people expressed frank doubts about this, because they dared not casually determine her fate in view of the air accidents of the US Navy's major hydrogen airships and the British airship R-101. Now it is exactly one year to date, although she has flown ten times, she has finally had an accident.</p>
<p>The only characteristic of the "Hindenburg" during her flight schedule was that the date of each flight coincided with what the company had announced in advance. Each flight had top drivers on board to manage everything. Dr. Eckner was the tutor of the "Hindenburg," and he personally took off several times. Secondly, Captain雷门 and Captain波鲁士 (Zeppelin airship commander during the European War) were also old hands at hydrogen airships. This time the captain was浦勒斯, and former captain莱曼 was also on board to take care of things.</p>
<p>From Germany to the United States, the "Hindenburg"'s route was not limited to one, because the Germans changed their route at any time depending on the weather based on their experience in driving hydrogen airships.</p>
<p>In the past voyages, the shortest time required was 52.8 hours and the longest was 78.1 hours: the number of passengers ranged from 21 to 72. There were originally only 50 berths in the ship, but later, because there were too many passengers, the number of berths was increased to 70 in August last year.</p>
<p>The carriage of mail was somewhat disappointing to the operators. On the first voyage of the "Hindenburg" from Europe to the United States, all parties had a lot of curiosity, and the "first voyage" hobby of stamp collectors set a record for the loading of mail—2,260 pounds. On the second flight from the United States to Europe, it was reduced to 1,820 pounds. Since then, the amount has varied, but no one has ever exceeded the above two records. From a maximum of 448 pounds to a minimum of 167 pounds. The fee for each mail weighing no more than half an ounce was four cents in US dollars, so the income was still considerable.</p>
<p>The weight of freight also varied each time. The most was the second eastbound voyage, carrying a total of 2,500 pounds; the last westbound voyage was as little as only 63 pounds. There were many kinds of freight, and it can be said that everything was available, from film to entire cars and entire airplanes, all of which had flown over the Atlantic Ocean. Calculated from the transportation income of passengers, goods, and mail, the operators still considered it profitable.</p>
<p>At present, the Zeppelin Company is also building a sister ship of the "Hindenburg"—LZ-130, which is 400 feet long and whose hull has been built. It is said that it can be completed in mid-September this year, and her sister—the "Hindenburg" travels between the United States and Germany every week, but her sister has died prematurely. I don't know what the fate of my younger sister will be?</p>
<h3>Blood-Flower Streets</h3>
<p>— Ge Yi</p>
<p>May, with what attitude should I express your return? Should I welcome you, this thriving season, or say you are the epidemic day that stings our nerves?</p>
<p>Bees sing your praises, because you bring them fruit-filling fragrant flowers, and the leaves also praise you, because you clothe them in lush green new clothes. Roses are gorgeously bloody: rambler roses are also seductively yellow, like a woman's fleeting autumn wave. Everything is growing, robust, full, and smiling.</p>
<p>The blood vessels of people also flow with the enthusiasm of your season. They want to jump, shout, survive, and smile!</p>
<p>The tips of every nerve in people are filled with excitement, and everyone is shouting:</p>
<p>——Give us the food of life.</p>
<p>——Give us freedom and joy.</p>
<p>Soybean-like beads of sweat flowed down the tanned faces of everyone, and the cry for the joy of life shouted a majestic song: "That is our season." They said</p>
<p>But the fierce whip of the street shower fell, the tense blood vessels ruptured, and giants rode on horses to trample those who were pursuing happiness in the streets. People fell down and scattered. Crying, brave, they sprinkled the hot blood of their hearts on the streets, frantically stepped forward and struggled until the end before falling down with a smile.</p>
<p>Row after row, singing in the streets to meet the shiny knives and guns! Falling down, rushing forward!</p>
<p>The breath of life is more enthusiastic than the sun and more spectacular than the angry waves.</p>
<p>When the hot and humid air rises and forms early summer thunderstorms, the earth returns to silence. The streets are washed with mottled bloodstains, and the trees are also full of heavy cherries.</p>
<p>"The melancholy season is over." Children are breathing in the freshness of the thunderstorm.</p>
<p>The earth is still rotating enthusiastically, but not with a suffocating and heavy atmosphere.</p>
