<h3>我國與法銀團成立金融協定</h3>
<p>信用借款四億佛郞　經濟合作促進貿易　孔副院長昨抵柏林</p>
<p>［巴黎］中國行政院副院長孔祥熙博士、本日午後與法國銀行團簽訂金融協定、由該銀行團、以特種放款貸予中國、俾得增加中國外幣存額、而使幣制益形穩固、按此項協定、乃係兩閲月前孔副院長聘訪法國時所擬議、迄至本日始乃簽字成立、孔副院長已於今晚啟程前往柏林、稍作勾留、並將往捷克京城一行、然後取道羅馬返國、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>孔氏於臨行前曾發表談話稱、此種合作係由中國幣制改革成功、有利於兩國之商業已為兩國互相承認之故、現彼行程所經之各國、均已感覺中國經濟發展前途之無量、及與中國發生關係之重要因此已陸續向中國表示深切之關念、及給與積極經濟合作之𤍠望、此卽彼所以能在各國成立各種重要財政經濟協定、促進此種合作之故也、“余今日於愉快之中、與貴國成立此種協定、實足證兩國間友誼之誠摯、法國為主張自由平等及歐洲各國間友愛之國家、而中國在遠東頃正為此種願望而奮鬬云、（中央社九日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］中國財政部長孔祥熙今日與法國銀行團簽訂鉅額放款合同、用作中國通貨之外幣準備此項借款、據稱總數為四萬萬佛郎、惟孔氏認為目前尚無提用全數之必要、暫時存放巴黎、以便隨時提取、孔氏聲稱、法國銀行深信協助中國之幣制改革、實大有裨於商務、並聞捷克亦頗有意於對華放款、孔氏今日首途赴柏林、將與德政府當局會晤、屆時德政府或將向孔氏保證、一旦中日開戰德國决不袒護日本、並悉孔氏訪問羅馬之時、意國亦將給以同樣之保證云、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］此間高級官塲方面今日對於法國銀行團對華放款一事、意見殊不一致、若干方面以為銀行界顯受政治作用之影響因放款之數甚微、在財政上並無重大之意義、其他方面則謂、協定內容或為一種短期墊款、中國不久即可用出超所存之佛郎償付、某大員並作私人表示、謂此事殆為政治上有勢力之歐洲人士對華親善之一種姿態云、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>抗戰時期的金融問題</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>在八月六日的時評中。我們已經提出了資金動員的問題。當時我們對於資本逃避海外的現𧰼。已指出了牠的嚴重性。很希望當局能從速發動大權。阻止防遏。可是一週以來。一方面旣未見當局有何種適當的措置。另一方面却看見逃避的現𧰼益復變本加厲。最近公債拋售之勢依然不絕。而提擠銀行存款之風潮。又接踵而起。少數錢莊銀行。甚且因週轉不靈而停業。照目前的大勢上論。以後若政府仍無確切辦法。金融風潮的擴大。是可盧的。</p>
<p>這次金融恐慌的顯露。最大的原因。是由於過去銀行家們唯利是圖。拼命投機買公債的結果。因此。一旦時局惡化。公債暴以後。就發生了今日不能應付提取存款的週轉不靈。所以。這是銀行自食其惡果。本不足惜。不過。問題是在目前正在凖備抗戰的時期中。後方是斷不應該使牠爆發金融恐慌的。換言之。在目前這個抗戰期中。正是資金需要動員集中的時候。然則那媒介資金需供的金融機關。也就應該可能的維持其不壞滅。而事實上。這金融機關的維持。不僅為週轉戰時金融之計。同時。也是一個安定後方社會民心的唯一要圖。</p>
<p>目前。如何來避免金融大恐慌的出現。我們以為最簡單的方法。是應該趕緊由政府發“支付延期命令”（Moratorium）。暫時中止一切的支付。這樣。把擠提存款及其他資金急速回收的現𧰼。可以停止。這一個方法。假若以為太積極一點。那末。我們以為應該呌中央銀行及中國交通等特殊銀行出來維持金融。一方面規定一個提取鑲行錢莊存款的最高限額。另一方面由中中交三行盡量對一般銀行為低利的公債押款。這樣也足以使目前行將爆發的金融恐慌。緩和下去的。不過。牠的範圍和效力。自然不及第一法來得廣泛。</p>
<p>假若僥倖的這次行將爆發的金融恐慌可以安然渡過了。那末。我們以為接着應該趕緊實行戰時金融統制。一方面嚴厲限制各金融機關不急需的投資。（但像最近許多金融機關的一律停止各項投資。這不問對於金融機關自身。或楚對於國家社會。都是不對的。）另一方面。應集中全國金融機關的資金。向軍需方面動員。凡一切直接間接對軍需有關的融資。金融機關應盡量的低利調度。在抗戰的時候。無論如何。金融家是應該深切的認識。那不是賺錢的機會。而是對國家民族服務的時候。</p>

<h3>滬英僑仗義建議</h3>

<p>已寓中國多年之許多外人、（日人除外）目覩時局之變遷對於伯爵之兩種主張、或不具多大之信任或𤍠誠、尤其因東京日領袖曾一再聲明彼等對華之一切行為、毫不以任何外國置念也、吾人深知日人為極重現實主義者、此以往事可為明證、近八月二日本埠最老之英報（譯者按乃指字林報）載有日人中島之長函、申述日軍在中國境內行其燒殺破壞工作之正當、並惜中國不能了解日本、不特希圖干涉日本增高兩國共同利益之神聖使命、且努力激動日本從事心所不願之武力需用、雖袒護中國之最守舊的外人、亦以中國之態度為異云云、余信除日人外之盈千累萬之旅華外僑、决不為中島之言所欺余因抱此信念、且因對於日本在華之侵略、復有甚佳之經騐、故以為凡我外僑、對於中華人民遭遇殘酷野蠻之敵人、以恐怖以無恥與挑量性之侵略、以狂蕩無覊日本軍人心意中之極度恣睢、摧殘中華人民祖國之土地、歷有年所、中心不勝悲憤、今已臻吾人表示切實姿勢之時日、想諸外僑當不以余言為謬也、</p>

<p>日本領袖曾宣布不以他國政府置念、但在華盈千累萬之外人若與日人完全絕交、予以一良好敎訓、則余信日人錢袋中所受之影響、必能使日人驚問其在華覃隊對華人所施之暴行、是否値得、是否聰慧、余並建議他國人民當日軍留駐中國境內之日、亦當與日人完全絕對絕交、俟日軍返至日本、則吾人所施之方法、亦可停止實行、但日兵一日在華任意蹂躪華人之權利與尊嚴、上天其許我外僑對日本軍閥表示厭惡與反對彼等在華之行為、而一日不止、駱華德W·Bruce　Lockhart啟八月七日</p>
<p>譯者按外僑尊重正義、愛我華人若是、而上海一般經營日貨之奸商、最近儘量將購存之日貨、交六公司輪船運往長江各口岸銷售、聞其數逾四千萬元之多、本月七日若輩接漢口日僑全數退出消息、更大喜過望、而將上海所存日本疋頭貨全數購入、改頭換面運往漢口長沙等處銷售、太古怡和兩公司之長江船竟為之應接不暇、運輸業之旺盛、據謂為六十年來所未有、此輩奸商讀此函後、眞將愧死矣、</p>

<h3>馮玉祥的話</h3>
<p>馮玉祥氏在巢縣原籍時，對該地保安隊士兵訓話，針砭軍人，頗足發聾振　，他說：</p>
<p>“我們在集會時，向總理遺像行鞠躬禮，固然表示尊敬總理，同時亦表示向總理懺悔，為什麼呢？因為總理遺慮中不是要我們去“廢除不平等條約”嗎？但目前不但沒有廢除，並且日漸增加，連東北士地也失去了，還不是我們軍人之恥嗎？</p>
<p>一般人都以穿軍服為榮，但每當我穿起軍服時，總感到有無限的慚愧，試看：人們蓄一隻狗，它能替主人守門，養一隻猫，它能替主人捕鼠，甚至是豬，豢肥了也可賣錢；而老百姓用血汗錢養活我們這些軍人，上不足以捍敵，下不足以衞民，這何以對同胞，何以慰總理在天之靈呢！</p>
<p>諸君要知道：國家失地一天未恢復，不平等條約一天未廢除，我們軍人責任一天未解除，恥辱一天未洗雪！努力吧！中華民國的軍人！”</p>
<p>— （泉）</p>
<h3>胡宗南將軍</h3>
<p>— 寒人</p>
<p>“匈奴未滅，何以家為”！</p>
<p>靑年將領胡宗南將軍，素有鋼鐵軍長之稱，年來對於剿匪，卓著功續，以是蔣委員長極倚重之。而胡部之服裝軍械，亦因此較為優美，軍容之壯盛，誠足壓倒一切。而胡氏之得與陳誠劉峙兩將軍，同稱中央軍之柱石亦以其饒有智略，而能戰無不勝故也。惟胡氏之年，已逾而立，在中國之早婚風尚之下，早應娶室，何况膺高位，居顯職者，更無不羅致姬妾，以為調劑。惟胡氏則不然，迄今猶抱獨身主義，蔣委員長嘗勸其早擇配偶，而各方友好，亦多為作水人，擬撮合一段姻綠，顧胡氏一律謝絕，嘗曰：“匈奴未减，何以家為”？必須先償我報國大志之後，始可娶妻生子：享受家庭樂趣云。聞者咸為敬佩不已。又胡氏平日在軍隊中，清廉自矢，能與士卒同甘苦，故部下無不尊敬擁護，其能屢建殊勳，固非偶然也。</p>
<h3>沈鈞儒軼事</h3>
<p>— 眉白</p>
<p>最近哄動海內，被控危害民國案七君子中，狠受全國人士重視的沈鈞儒老先生，早歲，隨總理從事革命工作，辛亥之役，任北京某大報筆政時；適袁項城鬧着洪憲夢的把戲，沈氏就在自己編輯的報上，寫一篇時事吟道：“或入圍中，拖出老猿還我國，余遊道上，不堪回首憶前途”。含痛斥而諷刺的色彩。袁氏看了不禁勃然大怒，下令查封該報館；一面就派員去逮捕他。</p>
<p>然而沈氏挺身而山，毫不畏怯，他們任何甜言引誘他，武力威脅他，他始終不屈服，不畏怕，並且把坦自的話去威動他。</p>
<p>後來項城無法扣留，經人解說後，就把沈氏釋放，但是地那不折不撓的精神，也可選入報人逸話中流傳吧。</p>
<h3>周佛海提倡“文武合一敎育”</h3>
<p>— 周俊元</p>
<p>江蘇省敎育廳長周佛海氏，頻年宣勞黨國，厥功甚偉，在他各種著作裹，可看到他學問的宏富和淵博，江蘇省年來敎育成績的突飛猛進，都是他細心擘劃，埋頭苦幹的結晶。</p>
<p>上月他出席江蘇學生集訓總隊補行之開學典禮，訓話時竭力提倡一文武合一敎育，”大意謂：</p>
<p>我國古時，本是文武兼修的，像周官保氏所掌之六藝禮·樂·射·御·書·數，便是文武合一敎育的實施·後世文武分途，遂致民族寖弱，國勢衰類。</p>
<p>國家民族因為文武分途國衰亡的例子很多我國宋代因為重文輕武而亡建元，元代又以重武輕文　亡於明。戰國　伴，古代羅馬之亡　日耳曼民族，也是為了重文輕武的　　。</p>
<p>當今嚴重的局勢之下，我們非提倡文武合一敎育不可從前六藝中的射是射箭，我們現在要來幫習槍砲的射擊：從前的御是駕車，我們現在要來學習駕御飛機和坦克車的技術。</p>
<p>同學們！我們要練成强健的體魄，學就熟練的戰術，共衝向復興民族的戰綫，逐出我們萬惡的仇敵！</p>
<h3>王亮疇好吃瓜子</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>前代行政院長王亮疇，每日除至外交部批閱例行公事外，餘時則與立委簡又文相過從，簡嘗以大華烈士之筆名，輯東南風，刋諸人間世等雜誌，近復興立委馮自由等，出版逸經於滬上，蒐集民元前後史料，以實篇幅。亮疇早歲投軍革命，於革命史績，素所習知，故簡恒倩亮疇為文。亮疇曩以政務鞅掌，屢却所請，近則政躬多暇，簡氏寓廬中，乃時見亮疇據座高談，娓娓不倦也。</p>
<p>亮疇好吃瓜子，有一瓜子大王”之稱，曩在英留學時，曾著刑法”書，每執筆為文，必預置黑瓜子於案頭，目剝目書，入其室瓜子殻痕籍滿地，履其上卜卜有聲，書成，所啖瓜子不可以斤計，留學界中人名該書日“瓜子刑法一一時傳為佳話。至今癖好未云簡知其所好，故亮疇每至，必大購瓜子響之。京滬一帶所盛行之五香瓜子，亮疇嗜之最深，次為南瓜仁，紅瓜子則殊非所喜云。</p>
<p>勘誤　星期一“平津哀歌”第二十五行“一齊起來救平津”句，應排在“摩拳擦掌秣馬厲兵”之後，特此更正。</p>
<p>聲明　七月二十八日本刊所載“追懷黄膺白”一文，查與事實稍有不符，特爲聲明。</p>
<h3>非常時期</h3>
<p>— 利前</p>
<p>“非常時期”，就是說不是平常的時期。</p>
<p>在這夏秋之交，人眼前的災難更多潛伏着！毒菌要肆其餘威，惡蚊要傳染瘧疾，還有赤痢，阿米巴痢疾…要猖獗流行，眞可說是“非常時期！”</p>
<p>防禦這些災禍，應該分頭應付：常用“亞林沙而”藥水消毒，殺滅細菌，燃點“五洲空心”蚊香，滅絕蚊類，服“安痢生”藥片，治痢防痢，都是有效的方法。</p>
<h3>女戰士</h3>
<p>— 幗</p>
<p>新中國的新女性們，都應該做救國的工作，做殺敵的女戰士！</p>
<p>但是女性的體質，多不及男性康健，因為女性常常患着體虛血虧等等的病態。</p>
<p>所以女性要想不落男子之後，必須積極鍛鍊，發奮自强，如體內有病，患月經不調者可購服通經活血之妙藥“月月紅”·患體虛血虧者可購服滋陰補虛之聖劑“女界實”，這樣當可達於康健之域。</p>
<h3>慈善的路人</h3>
<p>— 親</p>
<p>前天傍旬的時候，我在路上行走，忽然看見一個報販，跌倒在地，渾身發抖，霎時便有許多人圍攏來看，都說這報販是發了痧了！</p>
<p>這時候人叢中走出來一個人，他從身邊取出來個小瓶兒，灌些藥水在那報販的口裹，一會兒那報販便淸醒了，向給他吃藥的那人道謝。</p>
<p>那人說？“我這藥水是五洲藥房的“天工水”，是頂靈騐的痧藥水，我隨時帶在身邊，以備急需，今天却得救一命，我也很愉快呢”。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>壯語的內容</h3>
<p>— 蕪村</p>
<p>時局是沉悶的，看看報紙，却常有些五色斑爛的壯語，看得你頭昏。</p>
<p>自然。主張抗戰是一致的。前幾回“國難嚴重”的時候，還明明暗暗的說，和平未至絕望時期，犧牲未到最後關頸；勸國人學越王勾踐，臥薪嘗胆，十年生聚，十年教養，胡适博士還呌大家静待五十年。可是这一回，連“文化城”的北平和天津都淪陷了，我們再照老樣子，“臥”下去，“嘗”下去，直到四十五六年以後再抵抗嗎？</p>
<p>這，實在不成功了。因為小百姓雖然不懂兵法，却知道當前國勢的危急，倘不抗戰，就要滅亡。</p>
<p>適應這種民氣的，是許許多多的壯語。——要抗敵，當然非“壯懷激烈”不可，但有許多“壯”過了頭的論調，却常常会盡相反的任务：若加以抽筋剝皮似的細細推敲一下，就會發覺，那底子其實倒是變相的哀調。</p>
<p>比方前天，日大使用越南下，和平空氣又有點濃起來了，報紙上記載外交部發言人對于談判的態度說：“現在局勢雖極度緊張，然中日外交當局，在兩國國交依然存續之際，本可隨時商談，惟兩國關係，刻已至最陰惡時期，……倘彼方果以最大之决心與努力，挽回危局，尚未為晚，否則和平前途，殊難見有曙光也。”這意思彷彿“彼方”在向我們委曲求全，要求和平，而我們不答應。但實際是相反的，“彼方”的“最大之决心與努力，”早已用在兵力上了，到現在還想和平談判以“挽回危局”是可憐得很的。</p>
<p>說到抗戰，從前的壯語呌做“敵軍所至，抵抗隨之。”那是要到人家攻了進來以後，我們再到後面去抵抗。現在却更壯烈，變成“敵軍所至，焦土隨之。”——我們要使每一個人，每一一塊地，都成為“灰燼”，使他們毫無所得。</p>
<p>這真是“時日曷喪，予及汝偕亡，”切齒之聲，儼若可聞了。悲壯而激昂，“沈痛”之至。然而仔細一想，却又令人毛骨悚然。原來中國的抵抗力竟薄弱到這步田地，一打起來，就非使這“地大物博，人口衆多，”的國家全部化為“灰燼，”而毫無勝利的希望嗎？這樣的壯語，我恐怕有些胆小的人們聽了，是要因此油然而生和平之想的。</p>
<p>然而實際上並不這樣，世界上有被滅亡的民族，却並無這么凄慘的國家的。</p>
<p>呌大家决心犧牲，是一種壯懷。但犧牲豈不為了求存？為了民族的獨立自由的希望？一面宣布對於勝利的絕望，一面又呌大家準備變為“灰燼“，這種“為犧牲而犧牲”的絕呌，祗是一種十足的哀調。它不是什么沉痛，乃是無底的陰黯。</p>
<p>在全國一心，準備抗戰之際，鼓動和激勵是要的，但我們不怕犧牲，為的是最後的勝利。那些哀調式的壯語，聽了陡然令人氣短，——不說也罷。</p>
<h3>一封從日本寄來的信八月二日在京都</h3>
<p>— 舒牧</p>
<p>非常想念着故國消息，就是收到一幀明信片，也使我極為高興．今天，除了讀號外之外，在懊惱的時候，把盛放信件的盒子打了開來，從裏面拿了幾封舊的信，我一封一封地細細唸着，只有牠們才能使我少去許多寂寞與盼望。偶然我檢到一封信：</p>
<p>——……抗戰的日子快到了，你們得準備歸國呵。</p>
<p>那是前年從太原寄來的。</p>
<p>還有一封是世界語的，是從法國一個罐頭廠的工人那裏來的，上面熱烈地寫着。</p>
<p>——怒吼吧，你們中國，為什麼你不回國去參加工作呢？你，同志，居住在國內總比居住在國外好啊！同志，我們這裏有許多鐵鋼一樣的同志期望着抗戰的實現，打倒日本帝國主義，是應該從我們做起的，也可以說，那是應該從站在和平戰綫上的全世界的人們做起的。</p>
<p>——聽吧，我們已經在準備了，我們準備為中國效勞！我們為中國效勞，就是為和平效勞！同志，你們努力吧，我們在這裏常常能聽到你們底親切的呼聲！那是最快樂不過的。……</p>
<p>我一口氣把牠從頭到尾讀完了，我底心，漸漸活躍起來，好像聽到了槍聲和砲聲。……剛寫到這裹號外又來了，那錚鏘的鈴聲，刺着我底神經，我趕緊放下筆，從樓梯上奔下去，穿上鞋子。</p>
<p>一張號外從信箱裏塞了進來，呵，那張紙上寫着天津北平陷落的觸目驚心的大字。</p>
<p>我不相信，我不相信：中國怎會退？</p>
<p>正在我整理書籍的時候，有兩個巡士來，他們猙獰地問：</p>
<p>“你打算回國嗎？”</p>
<p>“是的。”</p>
<p>“為什麼？”</p>
<p>“因為暑假。”</p>
<p>“再來嗎？”</p>
<p>“來的。”</p>
<p>他把我所說的記入一本小簿子裏，隨卽來翻查我的書籍。我看到他們底那雙手時，心裏頭動得多麼利害呵。那時，我只有一個希望：</p>
<p>——別讓他們翻到我底文稿：</p>
<p>他們翻着，翻着，零亂地。</p>
<p>經過半個多鐘點，他們拿去了我底三本世界語的書．當他走後，桌上的鐘針，已經指着八時。</p>
<p>今晚，我也許有一塲恶夢。</p>
<h3>默</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>伸手向黑暗中懇求一些仁慈，那是不幸，悲哀而且也是徒然的事．幸福给予人的是微笑了又沉思了，沉思了又湮沒下去，一點點微微的波動，一缕雲霞，一些瞬間的痕跡。而当迷失在那種不幸和悲哀裏的时候，人會仕匀凈的呼吸裏添一些思慮，又會從思慮裏悵惘起來，笑一些也是慘淡的。於是一種心的啞默爬滿了尖端和角落。</p>
<p>為了追求一些幸福和仁慈，靈長的生物向黑暗裏伸出了兩隻手，他們有着慾望，他們偏愛着在空间上有所得失，而在時间上有所起伏。但那些湮沒了的幸福，只會在時間上做一絲瞬間的痕跡，在心裏却永遠停留着一種默契，眞有空間上的得失，和時間上的起伏。</p>
<p>你曾從隔壁鄰家聽見胎兒的哇哇的哭聲嗎，比方那是異樣的，而且贏得家人嘆息似的歡顏的？而我不幸是參與過許多人的葬儀，憑弔過許多處的屍塲，在解剖室裹終日埋首於纍纍的屍體中的人。</p>
<p>說是一個人死了，死是生命的佐證，死了的人正開展着另一方式的生命。在時間和空間上，正是一起一伏和一得一失。生命的痕跡淡薄了，淡薄了又消泯了，而一種默契却久暫地停留着，生活着美麗而新鮮地。</p>
<p>所以，伸手向黑暗中懇求一些仁慈是不幸，悲哀而且也是徒然的事。那些士邱的靑蒼的顏色，生命的象徵。而墳墓裏的棺木，棺木中的軀體，潰腐了而又混合了，成為糞土，成為灰塵飛散，停落而終于消滅，正像轟轟的生命在死的床榻上消滅一樣。</p>
<p>我看過屍塲上的屍首一具具地被𢱲出去了，一些管理人靜靜而忙碌地洗刷着紫黑的血漬，已經凝結了的，和還在凝結着的。雖然是暗濃的紫黑，但是一桶水冲下去，顏色變淡薄了，血漿離散地分裂開來，再用掃帚一掃，你會想像一些什麼呢？野蠻的血腥氣，陰積而化散不開的死者的靈魂，一個鬼，滿身血漬淋漓的一個鬼。……他們已經淡漠地攤下一條蘆蓆在乘凉了或是圍着食桌在歡笑着豐盛的晚餐哩。</p>
<p>你曾從怱忙裏抽一些空去拜訪過解剖室嗎？如果你害怕那些砍下來的頭顱，那些砍下來的胳臂和那些沒有了皮沒有了肌肉的髑髏的話，你不是也到過屠宰塲和菜市嗎？這些日常生活中的食品便是那些盡着實際效用的生人的遺體的一個好比擬。</p>
<p>我親身處理過完整而新鮮的屍體。從法院裏以絞索完結了生命的，死亡而沒有家屬認領的，曾是高潔的處女身的。一天到晚，我拿着人體上的某個骨塊，用纏不淸的拉丁名詞唸着，一雙腦袋上骨塊的名詞就有二千多個，我頭暈。</p>
<p>一個不肯死不服死的倔强的人，處以絞刑則必須要死，死了也必須在刀下受同一的處理。惟正是死卽生命的佐證，所以默認一個人死的事實，乃是令他身下藏屍坑，浸於防腐劑中，而那活躍如秒針的心臟凝凍着，於其在長成的靈魂却是極其相謬。</p>
<p>但是生人的遺體終於不足懼。只有時，絕望於仁慈和幸福時，在勻凈的呼吸裏添一些思慮，又會從思慮裏悵惘起來，慘淡地笑着，於是一種心的啞默爬滿了尖端和角落。</p>
<p>心在一種莫名的悶鬱，倚着欄干，又看見那個捧着隆起了的大肚皮的婦人走过了。有一種默契是具有空間上的得失和時間上的起伏的。</p>

<h3>英國汽車數輛增進</h3>
<p>— 陵</p>
<p>擴展公路建設陸</p>
<p>英國本部地狹人衆。在道路交通上向來是很稱擁擠的。近年來因為汽車事業的發達。和道路拓展的猛進。用汽車的人一天多似一天。有人說“我們將要廢止走路。”這倒是一句不過火的形容詞哩。除了脚踏車目下已較從前增加一倍有奇外。在英國現在差不多一英里路就有十四輛車子。每年新汽車加入道路行走的。其數在四五○·○○○輛左右·當然有許多輛是作為塡舊的。可是一年間新車的增加共數卻不在少。所以在最近三五年內。汽車數輛將進展到如何地步。眞有呌人難以想像的了。</p>
<p>目下英國的汽車數目。大約在二·六五○·○○○輛左右。其中私用汽車一·八○○·○○○輛。機器脚踏車四六○·○○○輛。單就本季而論。就有三三四·○○○輛新車。八五·○○○輛商用車。和九·二○○輛公共汽車等註冊。我們從下列的表中就可以看出來。近十五年來英國氣車使用的進步程度</p>
<p>依據上面的表推算起來。差不多每天加入路上服務的新汽車。其數約在一千二百輛。關於機器脚踏車項。共趨勢似乎有低跌之𧰼。大概這些人不是恢復到舊日的脚踏車。便是購買低價車了。公共汽車等的所以加增。其原因大半由於電車減少所致。不過像倫敦和其他各城市。公共汽車的數輛少有低跌。而車身和載客數則有上增之勢。</p>
<p>英國的地方雖然似乎小。而她各地的交通網卻是完密的很。全國現在有公路一八○·○○○英里。而這十八萬英里的公路。比較起來。在各國的道路哩程中間。要算頂大的了。不過有許多人覺得有些道路缺少完美的建設。往往祇有路形而沒有路基。有些路面也太不講究。難經載重汽車通過。照經驗所得。路面的材料一定要採用經久而防滑的。如此方能延長道路的壽命。對於車輛來往繁多的道路。這點尤關重要。本年運輸部對於各幹道都設法改進。其哩數近四，五○○。譬如路的闊度。車輛來往的雙重道等。都有一定的標凖。該部並不等往各處測繪完竣。目下已經著手進行工作。所有路圍路燈等都在改進之例。至於今後的擴展。照目下情勢而言·也一定有增無已。因為道路的需要·一天高增似一天。以後的進步尚較現在更速哩。</p>
<p>公共汽車等的載客較二三年前已見增進。目下比照一九三一年時。每一車增多三個搭客。製造公共汽車的廠商。其營業都較客車或脚踏車為佳。脚踏車的乘用者現在也較往昔為多。這原因大概有二·一是大衆歡喜在戶外空氣中運動。二是因為郊外建築增進。許多人都遷移到較遠的地方去居住。代步的脚踏車。當然其需要比較的要加增了。</p>
<h3>汽車零訊</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>▲各牌汽車銷數一斑本年上半年三月份的別克國內市場零售交貨數已達二○，九五一輛。一九三六年同時期間為一五，一○七輛。所以今年銷數實較往年為鉅。納許車的三月份銷數計為一○，○○○輛。道琪舊車。包括客車與商用車。今年開首一季的銷數。比較去年增進百分之五八·一。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Concentrate Forces to Invade Chahar</h3>
<p>The Ping-Sui Line is Tense, A Major Battle is Imminent; Japan Deploys Eight Divisions for a Large-Scale Invasion; Part of the Enemy Attempts to Cross at Liangwangzhuang, but is Repelled</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 9:00 PM tonight, part of the enemy troops at Liangwangzhuang secretly crossed the river west from the east bank of the Grand Canal. They were □□□ by our division, resulting in four enemy soldiers killed, two horses killed, two soldiers wounded, and one empty ammunition vehicle captured. (Urgent telegram at 1:00 AM on the 11th) There was artillery fire north of Duliu in Jinan this morning, which soon stopped, and the day was peaceful. (Urgent telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] According to refugees who escaped from Liangwangzhuang, enemy troops locked villagers near Liangwangzhuang in their houses, set them on fire, causing horrific burns and unspeakable suffering. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] ①The Sui Police Bureau sent police to each household in the streets and alleys on the 8th, morning and afternoon, to notify them to organize self-help associations, with able-bodied men from each street and alley taking on the rescue work for their own lanes. It is generally expected that enemy planes will bomb Sui. ②Military agencies here have been working day and night in great tension recently. Sunday, the 8th, was a normal working day. Observers speculate that a major battle will take place on the front lines within one or two days. ③It is reported that the front line at Honggeertu, east of Sui, was very tense on the 8th. Zhao Chengshou and Peng Yubin arrived in Sui on the night of the 7th. Men Bingyue did not travel with Zhao and others because he was meeting them on the 7th. After Fu Zuoyi summoned Zhao and others on the morning of the 8th to discuss defense matters, Men, Peng, and Da Milingsulong immediately returned to eastern Sui separately to make arrangements. (Delayed special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to transportation circles, the Japanese army on the Ping-Han Railway is now west to Pengzudian, 18 li from Changxindian, and south to Doudian, and has set up artillery positions on the city wall of Liangxiang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to foreign sources in Tianjin, Itagaki has arrived in Tianjin, and his Fifth Division will arrive successively within five days to prepare for the second major battle. The Japanese side seems to be focusing on the Ping-Sui Line. It is said that troop preparations are for fourteen divisions, of which eight have already arrived. It is also learned that it is planned for General Terauchi or Lieutenant General Koiso to come to China to serve as commander. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] The Japanese army is now concentrating all its efforts on invading Chahar. In addition to the daily engagements at Nankou and Yanqing, a large number of Japanese troops are also gathering in the northern Chahar area. One regiment each of Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery has been discovered at Nanhouzhan, advancing south under the cover of more than fifty armored vehicles, seemingly attempting to attack Chaigoubao from Ximalin, cutting off our Chahar-Sui communications. Our garrison is on high alert. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 6:00 PM on the 9th, the Japanese army invaded Jinghai County from Duliu Town. They were met with a head-on attack by our army, and after a fierce battle until 11:00 PM, they were finally repelled by our army. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Plan to Invade Chahar</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] According to sources, the Japanese army intends to invade Chicheng and Longguan in southern Chahar from Dushikou, harboring great ambitions. They have been actively reinforcing troops in the Rehe area. The Fourth Cavalry Brigade, led by Matsumuro Takayoshi, is moving from Shenyang to Chifeng. It is said that a part of the brigade will be stationed in Dolon. The Kawahara Division will fully deploy to Chengde within days, and another large army will follow, with an unknown serial number. In addition, Zhou Chengqing, the puppet commander of the Fourth District of Chengde, has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forward forces. Zhou has been ordered to lead four regiments of infantry under Liu Rongqing to concentrate and await orders in the Fengning and Dage areas of western Rehe, and to deploy twenty Chengde bombers and four reconnaissance planes for use. (Delayed special dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Situation of Bandits and Puppets in Northern Chahar</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] According to sources on the 6th, the Japanese army's First Division is hastily building fortifications in the Jingpeng, Dage Town, Shanghuangqi, and Waigoumenzi areas of western Rehe. The situation is urgent. There are also reports from Xikaiguyuan regarding the recent deployment of puppet troops in northern Chahar: ①Li Shouxin's direct troops, Liu Jigang, Yin Baoshan, Wang Zhenhua, and Bao Zichen's four divisions are stationed in the Zhangbei, Nanhouzhan, Shangyi, and Shangdu areas. ②Wang's direct Fifth Division, led by Yi Shaoxian, has all concentrated in Pindingbao. The Sixth Division, led by Bao Enpu, is stationed in Baochang. The Eighth Division, led by Bao Yueqing, has all gathered in Dolon. The Ninth Division, led by Bu Yin Dalai, is stationed in the Western Banner. Currently, two regiments have been deployed to Huade. ③The operational plan is to use De Wang's troops as the front line, and Li Shouxin's combat troops are also the main force in the front, but they will not resist to the death. If there is fighting, they will retreat to Dolon after offering slight resistance. ④Defensive works have been built along the Heihe, Guyuan, and Baochang areas, and large quantities of military supplies have been stored in Gudu, Pindingbao, and other places in preparation for a protracted war.

According to reports from outside the pass, the First Division of Rehe puppet troops is currently stationed in the Heihechuan area, reportedly under Zhang Yizhe. The Japanese side has approved Yi Shaoxian's nephew to establish a puppet army brigade, with the brigade headquarters located in Pindingbao. There are already more than 300 men, and the firearms are all made in Fengtian, of the Han Linchun type. Zhang Haipeng has recently expressed remorse and a desire to defect, but Zhang has long lost control over his subordinates, and many officers at all levels are Japanese, so it is feared that this will be difficult to realize.

<h3>Our Country and French Banking Groups Establish a Financial Agreement</h3>
<p>Credit Loan of 400 Million Francs Economic Cooperation to Promote Trade Vice President Kong Arrived in Berlin Yesterday</p>
<p>[Paris] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, signed a financial agreement with a French banking group this afternoon, by which the banking group will provide China with a special loan to increase China's foreign exchange reserves and further stabilize the currency system. According to this agreement, it was proposed two months ago when Vice President Kong visited France, and was only signed today. Vice President Kong has departed for Berlin this evening, will stay there briefly, and will then go to the capital of Czechoslovakia before returning home via Rome. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Before leaving, Kong published a statement stating that this cooperation is due to the success of China's currency reform, which is beneficial to the commerce of both countries and has been mutually recognized by both countries. He said that all the countries he has passed through have felt the immense potential of China's economic development and the importance of establishing relations with China, and have therefore successively expressed deep concern and active desire for economic cooperation with China. This is why he has been able to establish various important financial and economic agreements in various countries to promote this cooperation. "I am pleased to conclude this agreement with your country today, which fully demonstrates the sincerity of the friendship between the two countries. France is a country that advocates freedom, equality, and friendship among European countries, and China in the Far East is currently fighting for this kind of aspiration," he said. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Chinese Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi signed a huge loan contract with a French banking group today for use as foreign currency reserves for China's currency. This loan is said to total 400 million francs, but Kong believes that there is currently no need to withdraw the full amount and will temporarily deposit it in Paris for withdrawal at any time. Kong stated that French banks firmly believe that assisting China's currency reform is of great benefit to commerce, and it is also heard that Czechoslovakia is also very interested in providing loans to China. Kong departed for Berlin today, where he will meet with German government officials. At that time, the German government may guarantee to Kong that Germany will not side with Japan once China and Japan go to war, and it is also learned that when Kong visits Rome, Italy will also give the same guarantee. (National News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi arrived here this morning by train from Paris, about half an hour late. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tiantong, embassy staff, representatives of overseas Chinese, Jiang Jieshi's son Jiang Weiguo, the director of the Far East Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and many other officials welcomed him at the station. Kong originally planned to rest at the Baden-Baden hot springs for a few days, but this has been cancelled due to the tense situation in the Far East. He will stay in Berlin for a week to continue discussing trade promotion issues with German Minister of Economy and President of the Central Bank Dr. Schacht. Dr. Schacht is scheduled to host a banquet for him at noon today. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>[Washington] High-ranking officials here today have very different opinions on the French banking group's loan to China. Some believe that the banking community is clearly influenced by political factors because the amount of the loan is very small and has no significant financial significance. Others say that the content of the agreement may be a short-term advance, which China can soon repay with francs saved from trade surplus. One senior official also privately expressed that this matter is probably a gesture of goodwill towards China by politically powerful Europeans. (National News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<h3>The Defenses of Beijing are Solidified</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Mayor Ma Chaojun said that he is extremely angry at the Japanese invasion of Pingjin. Various measures that should be taken in Beijing during this extraordinary period are being carried out and completed in order. As for air defense, both passive and active aspects are fully prepared, so there is no need to worry. Underground shelters, etc., are also being rushed to be equipped. However, for the sake of the safety of the citizens, I hope that the citizens will pay more attention to this. It is best if private individuals can operate underground shelters to supplement the government's ability to meet all needs. The organization of a joint safety and protection group is under the command of trained civil servants and able-bodied men, with a large number of people and a very strict and close-knit organizational line. If an alarm is sounded, it is believed that the deployment of protection will be swift and effective, and can reduce disasters. Regarding the food issue, a proper solution has been agreed upon with the relevant agencies. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Financial Issues During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In the commentary on August 6th, we raised the issue of capital mobilization. At that time, we pointed out the seriousness of the phenomenon of capital flight overseas and hoped that the authorities would quickly exercise their power to prevent and deter it. However, in the past week, on the one hand, we have not seen any appropriate measures taken by the authorities, and on the other hand, we have seen that the phenomenon of capital flight has become even more intensified. Recently, the trend of selling government bonds has continued unabated, and the wave of bank runs has followed. A small number of private banks and banks have even suspended operations due to financial difficulties. Judging from the current trend, if the government does not take definite measures, the expansion of the financial crisis is predictable.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for this financial panic is the result of bankers in the past seeking only profit and desperately speculating on government bonds. Therefore, once the situation deteriorated and government bonds plummeted, they were unable to cope with withdrawals. So, this is the banks reaping what they sowed and is not worth pitying. However, the problem is that in the current period of preparation for the war of resistance, the rear should not be allowed to erupt in financial panic. In other words, in the current period of war of resistance, it is precisely the time when funds need to be mobilized and concentrated. Therefore, the financial institutions that mediate the supply and demand of funds should be maintained as far as possible. In fact, maintaining these financial institutions is not only for the sake of financing the war, but also the only way to stabilize the morale of the rear.</p>
<p>Currently, how to avoid the emergence of a major financial panic? We believe the simplest method is for the government to quickly issue a "Payment Deferral Order" (Moratorium), temporarily suspending all payments. This will stop the phenomenon of rapid withdrawal of deposits and other funds. If this method is considered too aggressive, then we believe that the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and other special banks should come out to maintain the financial system. On the one hand, set a maximum limit for withdrawals from banks and private banks. On the other hand, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank should provide low-interest government bond-backed loans to general banks as much as possible. This is also sufficient to alleviate the financial panic that is about to erupt. However, its scope and effectiveness are naturally not as broad as the first method.</p>
<p>If, by chance, the financial panic that is about to erupt can be safely overcome, then we believe that wartime financial control should be implemented immediately. On the one hand, strictly restrict unnecessary investments by financial institutions. (But recently, many financial institutions have uniformly stopped all investments, which is wrong both for the financial institutions themselves and for the country and society.) On the other hand, the funds of financial institutions across the country should be concentrated and mobilized for military needs. Financial institutions should provide low-interest financing for all matters directly or indirectly related to military needs. During the war of resistance, in any case, financiers should deeply recognize that this is not an opportunity to make money, but a time to serve the country and the nation.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Exercise Held in Southern England</h3>
<p>400 Aircraft Participated, 30 Raids in One Night</p>
<p>[London] A large-scale air force night raid exercise is being held in southern England, with as many as 400 aircraft participating. Among them, the attacking air force consists of 176 bombers, and the defenders consist of 19 squadrons of fighter planes. As many as 30 air raids were carried out last night. Locations that were successfully attacked include the London Docks and the Royal Air Force Headquarters. In addition, the defenses of Uxbridge and Colchester were also "hit" by countless incendiary bombs by the enemy. Afterwards, the Ministry of Aviation issued a notice stating that only two squadrons of bombers encountered resistance after carrying out their bombing, and the rest were intercepted in advance. Furthermore, this exercise will continue for two more nights. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th via Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Authorities in this city conducted an air defense exercise last night over the city and the northeastern suburbs. Both attacking and defending forces each used 100 bombers and fighter planes. The defenders also deployed multiple batteries of anti-aircraft guns at key military locations. Citizens who volunteered to serve as air raid spotters were hidden separately at the locations under attack and reported information to the defending authorities by telephone. Reports were able to be issued as early as 70 miles before enemy aircraft arrived. The results of the exercise have proven that the air defense equipment of this city has made great progress, but it is difficult to determine its effectiveness in the event of heavy fog. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th via Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The large-scale London air defense exercise started at 6 p.m. yesterday and continued until dawn today. There were a total of 50 attacks. The "enemy" in the exercise only achieved their objectives in eight places without encountering resistance. Fortunately, there were no casualties despite the poor weather.

<h3>Hope for Another World Peace Conference in the United States</h3>
<p>Hull's Declaration Also Endorsed by Germany, Roosevelt to Deliver Important Speech</p>
<p>[Washington] After U.S. Secretary of State Hull met with Chinese Ambassador Wang Zhengting on the 17th of last month, and subsequently issued a declaration on maintaining world peace and adhering to treaties, almost all countries in the world have accepted it. Therefore, the hope for convening a world peace conference as soon as possible has been rekindled. Although Japan and Germany have not yet expressed their views, it is said that important politicians in these three countries have previously welcomed such a conference. As for the US government's tendency, President Roosevelt will deliver a speech at Roanoke Island, North Carolina, on the 18th of this month, clarifying his position. In addition, New York banking circles have heard that informal talks on war debt issues and commercial treaty issues in London may soon move to Washington, and that these talks are progressing smoothly, with the possibility of restoring commemorative payments and repealing the Johnson Act. As a result, there is hope for the restoration of international trade and prosperity in the future, and the convening of a world peace conference will also be advanced. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th via Reuters)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to reports from Washington, the U.S. State Department announced that more than 40 countries have expressed their support for the political declaration issued by Secretary of State Hull on July 16. German authorities claim that Germany is also one of the countries that support it. It also stated that the German government is very interested in Hull's declaration and adopts a positive attitude towards the ideals of the declaration. It solemnly declared that the German government's basic attitude is that the adjustment of international relations should follow the path of friendly negotiations. Therefore, the German government and Hull are in complete agreement. (National Maritime News dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nanjing It has been reported that the Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya has replied to Hull's conversation, stating that, regarding Secretary of State Hull's conversation, treaties are, in principle, inviolable, but some provisions contained in the treaties may be modified. The Hungarian government believes that the situation in the Danube River basin countries created by various peace treaties after the European War cannot be considered immutable. However, Hungary reiterates that if this situation is to be changed, it can only be done through peaceful means. Hungary has always respected all treaties, but other countries have not, especially regarding treaties on ethnic minorities, which is regrettable. Finally, Hungary will gladly accept any economic solutions that gradually remove trade barriers and help improve the world economic situation.

<h3>British Army Improves Military Service</h3>
<p>Encourages Career Soldiers</p>
<p>[London] The British War Office announced today new proposals to improve the terms of service for regular army soldiers. These proposals are a trial measure for a limited period of time, allowing soldiers to extend their service period when their first term is about to expire, and allowing reservists in categories A and B to rejoin the army. Soldiers in both categories, after serving for 12 years, may remain in service until 21 years, so they can be qualified to receive a pension. Currently, the most common way to recruit soldiers is for them to enlist for seven years and be in the reserve for five years. Only in special circumstances are soldiers allowed to extend their service period to be eligible for a pension, or are reservists allowed to rejoin the army. The trial measures indicate the extent to which current soldiers or reservists are willing to make the army a lifelong career. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th via Reuters)</p>

<h3>Anglo-German Discord</h3>
<p>Germany Asks The Times to Recall Its Berlin Correspondent</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the expulsion of three correspondents from German local guiding newspapers and The Daily Telegraph stationed in London by the British government, the German Chargé d'affaires in Britain, Walter Rauffmann, recently lodged a protest with the British Foreign Office. Sir Forbes, Counsellor of the British Embassy in Germany, recently visited the Foreign Office for discussions. In retaliation, the German government has decided to demand that The Times of London recall its Berlin correspondent, Albert, within two weeks and replace him with another correspondent. The new correspondent must not conflict with the German political system. It is reported that Albert has been The Times' Berlin correspondent since 1915 and has been elected chairman of the Berlin Foreign Correspondents' Association, with a long-standing reputation in diplomatic and journalistic circles. However, the German National Socialist Party has repeatedly attacked him because The Times often publishes news unfavorable to the German government regarding the dispute between the German government and the church, which is believed to have been sent by Albert.

The newspaper pointed out that foreign investment in Poland has not had satisfactory results in the past, especially French investment. However, Swedish investment in Poland has not encountered much resistance, so Poland is eager to increase and develop trade relations between the two countries. In addition, Sandler will also discuss diplomatic issues with Polish authorities, as he will inform Warsaw officials of some information he obtained during his recent visit to Moscow.

<p>⊙Bucharest Political circles recently declared that important events will soon occur in domestic politics. The current Chamber of Deputies has practically completed its term since the re-election in 1933. Several important members of the Tătărescu cabinet will retire to prepare for the election. As for the recent re-election results of the provincial and municipal councils, the right-wing National Liberal Party received the most votes, followed by the opposition National Peasant Party. Although the total number of votes obtained by the various right-wing parties is comparable to the left-wing National Peasant Party, they may not be able to form a coalition due to their respective plans. Therefore, Prime Minister Tătărescu (the leader of the National Liberal Party) will submit his resignation within days, and the National Peasant Party is most likely to succeed in forming a cabinet. Political circles said that the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries is scheduled to meet on the 19th, and the Tătărescu cabinet will not step down until after the conclusion of this meeting.

<h3>Orangutan Refuses to Have Youth Glands Removed, Flees Up Pine Tree to Avoid Dissection</h3>
<p>⊙Naples The famous medical scientist Voronoff once invented the method of extracting youth glands from apes and injecting them into the human body, which can achieve the effect of rejuvenation. A certain hospital here has six orangutans, intending to extract their youth glands according to Voronoff's theory. The orangutans, as if aware of this, fled to the hundred-foot-high pine trees in the garden of the Villa Capodimonte to hide. The hospital authorities, unwilling to shoot them, sent armed police to guard under the trees, waiting for them to submit due to hunger. They have not yet been captured.

<h3>France Protests to Spanish Rebel Forces</h3>
<p>Regarding the Bombing of Merchant Ships</p>
<p>[Paris] French, British, Italian, and Greek ships were bombed by aircraft off the coast of Algiers in French Africa. The French government has ordered the consul stationed in Salamanca, Spain, to protest to the Nationalist authorities. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th via Havas)</p>
<p>⊙Casablanca, French North Africa The French postal ship General Liode, sailing back to France from Dakar in French West Africa, encountered a serious accident when berthing at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands of Spanish territory. The incident arose because the ship carried three Spanish passengers. The Nationalist authorities of the port claimed that these passengers should be drafted into military service and demanded that they be sent ashore. Although the French consul and the shipowner had agreed to do so, the crew held a meeting and decided to refuse. Several Nationalist gunboats surrounded the General Liode, aimed machine guns at it, and sent hundreds of armed soldiers on board, using rifle butts to beat the crew, forcing them to gather on the stern of the ship. Finally, they found the three Spanish passengers and escorted them ashore. Afterwards, they ordered the General Liode to sail out of the port and warned the shipowner that if the crew took any demonstration actions, they would open fire and sink it. After this incident, it is heard that French postal ships will no longer berth at Las Palmas. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th via Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the British cargo ship Coverdale being attacked by aircraft off the coast of Algiers in French North Africa, the Nationalist authorities of Majorca Island replied to General Howell that the protest would be forwarded to General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government. At this time, all warships belonging to Britain have been ordered to maintain constant communication with the country's merchant ships so that they can quickly rush to rescue them if the merchant ships are attacked. Some people here believe that the above method is more effective than sending a few warships to escort merchant ships. As for what methods British warships should use to ensure that the British flag is respected, it is up to each warship to decide. Also, a newspaper this morning advocated that warships belonging to any country can fire on aircraft when merchant ships of any country are attacked. People in the British naval circles believe that it is better for each country to protect its own ships. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th via Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The British ship Mallerd, which had carried an Irish international inspector, a doctor, and four nurses to Santander, Spain, on July 14, preparing to transport refugees out of the country, was detained by a Nationalist warship in the waters of the port, and all the crew members were also arrested. Afterwards, the British government sent a note to the Spanish Nationalist authorities, requesting that the arrested personnel be released and that all losses suffered by the ship be compensated. The General Headquarters of the Nationalist forces in Salamanca sent a reply to the British government, only explaining the cause of the accident and stating that all 32 crew members of the Mallerd ship had "pro-communist" tendencies.

<h3>Soviet Union Maintains Collective Farmland System</h3>
<p>Determined to Take Extremely Hard Measures</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government is now engaged in a tough campaign to maintain the system of collectively operated farmland. Due to the fact that various "enemies of the people" have induced farmers to restore the old system of private cultivation and privately distribute all or part of the land belonging to collective farms, such situations have become commonplace. Therefore, the government has decided to take various tough measures to prohibit this. The chairman of the executive committee of the Communist Party in the Yaroslavl region and five other public officials have dissolved three collective farms and distributed their land to farmers since 1934. Therefore, they were sentenced by the Soviet court of the region to imprisonment for two to ten years. In other regions, many collective farms have been dissolved. For example, the Svoboda and Vuria collective farms in the Ugrytsky region were all dissolved. The "May 1 Collective Farm" in the Voronezh region, under the supervision of local authorities, distributed all its movable and immovable property to farmers. According to Pravda, "493 families, or about 2,000 people, who opposed the distribution of land in collective farms in various regions such as Mogilev in the Belarusian Republic were expelled by Trotskyist and rightist spies, and local authorities did not interfere. In addition, wealthy peasants seized back previously confiscated land and cultivated it themselves. In the region, the interests of collective farms are unclear, and no less than 3,000 places have adopted the old system of private cultivation."

<h3>Patriotic Suggestions from British Residents in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Advocating Complete Severance of Relations with Japan</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of the *Continental Daily*:</p>
<p>On August 7th, your esteemed newspaper published a Reuters dispatch from London stating that Lord Listowel, Chairman of the "Friends of the Chinese People" in London, had sent a letter to the *Manchester Guardian*, earnestly stating the dangerous disputes that Japan's renewed invasion of China would cause, and expressing deep concern over the inaction of the British government. The letter further stated, "The expansionist policy now being pursued by the Japanese military clique is bound to cause a world war. Today it is increasingly clear that the Earl believes that 'If the Chinese government invokes Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant and submits any petition, the British government should support it. The British government should urgently convene a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to consider the overall situation on a fair basis and re-establish peace.'"</p>
<p>Many foreigners who have resided in China for many years (excluding Japanese) have witnessed the changes in the situation and may not have much trust or sincerity in the Earl's two proposals, especially since Japanese leaders in Tokyo have repeatedly stated that all their actions towards China are not considered by any foreign country. We know that the Japanese are extreme realists, as evidenced by past events. Recently, on August 2nd, the oldest British newspaper in this city (*translator's note: referring to the North China Daily News*) published a long letter from a Japanese named Nakajima, stating the legitimacy of the Japanese army's burning, killing, and destruction work in China, and regretting that China cannot understand Japan, not only attempting to interfere with Japan's sacred mission of increasing the common interests of both countries, but also striving to incite Japan to engage in military needs that it does not want to. Even the most conservative foreigners who protect China regard China's attitude as different. I believe that, apart from the Japanese, the countless foreign expatriates in China will not be deceived by Nakajima's words. Because I hold this belief, and because I have a very good experience of Japan's aggression in China, I believe that all our foreign expatriates feel unbearable grief at the sight of the Chinese people encountering cruel and barbaric enemies, with terror, shamelessness, and provocative aggression, wantonly trampling on the land of the Chinese people's motherland for many years with the extreme willfulness in the hearts of the Japanese military. Now is the time for us to express a practical posture, and I think that the foreign expatriates will not consider my words to be wrong.</p>
<p>There is a small company in London called "Friends of the Chinese People." Of course, other countries also have similar companies. However, the patriotic movement of foreign small groups will be ineffective unless it receives the active support of foreign expatriates living in China who share with the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned extreme willfulness in the hearts of the Japanese military can be evidenced by the public statement of Ozaki, an old member of the Japanese House of Representatives. Ozaki is over eighty years old and has been a member of parliament since the establishment of the first parliament in 1890. In June of this year, he made a powerful speech in the parliament, saying, "The armies of the world's first-class countries all abide by their duties and dare not overstep the boundaries. We are second- and third-class countries, and both the army and navy can talk about politics at will. Spain is a good example. Now a tragic civil war has occurred in the country. In recent years, the soldiers of our country's army have acted without the command of the emperor and the grand marshal. No one has ever issued orders for the incidents of May 15th and February 26th. The army can carry out its revenge means as much as it likes, and then close the door and remain silent." Although Ozaki courageously spoke out to criticize the military clique, the military clique's main opinion is still rampant, as exemplified by the new commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, Lieutenant General Xiangyue. When Xiangyue arrived in Tianjin last month to take office, he declared that his arrival was to "slightly punish the brutal Chinese." Afterwards, he burned Tianjin, fulfilling his barbaric wishes. We now see countless poor Chinese people, supporting the old and carrying the young, flocking to the streets of Shanghai to escape Xiangyue's so-called "punishment" because they dare to be born as Chinese and not Japanese, and their eyes cannot understand the sacred mission of the Japanese army to destroy China and the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Such base and shameless and frightening acts may proceed in full measure. But as I see it, for all foreign expatriates living here with the Chinese who hate Japanese militarism and the Japanese army in China, now is the time to take practical action to make the Japanese civilians realize our feelings about the Japanese army's invasion of China and the chaos, misery, and disasters that will result from it. It can be a patriotic and appropriate attitude towards the Chinese people. I now propose a suggestion that can achieve better results than what small companies in London do. What is the suggestion? That is, to organize a larger company in Shanghai, called "Foreign Friends of China and the Chinese People." Anyone who joins this association should not have any dealings with the Japanese while the Japanese army remains stationed in China. All foreign friends of China and the Chinese people should resolutely not speak a word to the Japanese, not travel with them, not buy Japanese goods, not sell goods to the Japanese, not engage in any dealings with the Japanese, and reject anything Japanese. The Japanese are extremely realistic. If foreigners in China completely sever social and business dealings with the Japanese, the effect will gradually make the Japanese people aware of the sincerity of foreigners' hatred of the arrogant behavior of the Japanese army in China. This noble and quiet posture is a practical posture. If foreigners in China can start to implement it immediately, they will soon receive a response from other countries. I also hope that foreigners will absolutely refuse to travel on Japanese ships and not entrust goods to Japanese ships for transportation. Foreigners should stop traveling to Japan and not spend money in that country. There are many scenic spots in the Far East that can be used for recreation. Why must you go to Japan? Furthermore, foreign expatriates in Shanghai should no longer buy anything from Japanese stores. If you want to buy Chinese goods, you can buy them from Chinese stores. Let the Japanese trade with each other and maintain the atrocities of their army in China with their inadequate business.</p>
<p>My advocacy of complete severance of relations between foreign friends of China and the Chinese people and the Japanese and the rejection of all things Japanese. I would also like to declare that when it is unavoidable to deal with individual Japanese people, you should still treat them with caution and courtesy. In any case, there should be no violent expressions in words, posture, or behavior towards such people, because if you commit impolite or improper acts against individuals, the great moral strength of complete severance of relations will be lost.</p>
<p>Japanese leaders have announced that they do not consider other countries' governments, but if the countless foreigners in China completely sever relations with the Japanese, giving them a good lesson, then I believe that the impact on the Japanese people's wallets will surely make the Japanese people wonder whether the atrocities committed by their garrison in China against the Chinese are worth it and whether they are wise. I also suggest that the people of other countries should also completely and absolutely sever relations with the Japanese on the day the Japanese army remains stationed in Chinese territory. When the Japanese army returns to Japan, the methods we have implemented can also be stopped. However, as long as the Japanese soldiers arbitrarily trample on the rights and dignity of the Chinese people in China for one day, Heaven will allow us foreign expatriates to express our disgust and opposition to the Japanese military clique and their actions in China, and it will not stop for one day.</p>
<p>W. Bruce Lockhart, August 7th.</p>
<p>Translator's note: Foreign expatriates respect justice and love our Chinese people so much. However, the Shanghai general merchants who deal in Japanese goods have recently tried their best to transport the Japanese goods they have purchased and stored to various ports along the Yangtze River for sale by ships of the Six Companies, and it is said that the amount exceeds 40 million yuan. On the 7th of this month, these people received the news that all the Japanese expatriates in Hankou had withdrawn, and they were overjoyed. They purchased all the Japanese fabrics stored in Shanghai, changed their appearance, and transported them to Hankou, Changsha, and other places for sale. The Yangtze River ships of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson were too busy to cope. The prosperity of the transportation industry is said to be unprecedented in 60 years. These unscrupulous merchants will really be ashamed to death after reading this letter.</p>

<h3>After the Japanese Army Invaded Hebei, the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Army Rose Up to Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Armies Extremely Active in Northern Manchuria's Forest Regions; Anti-Japanese Armies in Rehe Killed Many Japanese and Puppet Troops and Police</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army provoked and broke out war in our Hebei Province, the news has spread to various parts of the Northeast, and the people have been longing for the Han Dynasty. The anti-Japanese army bravely killed the enemy, especially the anti-Japanese army in Rehe, because it is close to the border of Chahar and Suiyuan, in the forefront of the front line, without exception, they sacrificed themselves to serve the country and were very active. The situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Harbin News, the puppet forest police team in Boli County, due to the remote area, the anti-Japanese army is very active, the Japanese side sent a Japanese officer, leading more than 100 puppet police, set off on the 25th of last month, passing through a district of Qiezhe River, Qitai River, Shuangtou, Qinglong Mountain, Daxiaoliuzhan, Luoquan River, Qingshan Fort area. When they arrived in Dongshan Wilderness, they were suddenly attacked by a combined anti-Japanese army of about 250 people. The puppet police retreated while resisting. The anti-Japanese army scattered and ambushed in the mountains and forests to shoot and attack. The battle lasted until night. The anti-Japanese army was afraid that the Japanese and puppet army reinforcements would arrive, so it was inconvenient to pursue. It is said that the puppet police suffered heavy damage in this battle, and a Japanese officer was also killed.</p>
<p>Inside Rehe</p>
<p>Chengde News, according to refugees from the Japanese and Korean merchant farmers in Niuyingzi, Ten Districts of Lingyuan, the anti-Japanese armed forces occupying the area around Laoshan Zuozi Qianhoucao include Hou, Jin Badian, Shuangshan, Zhanshanhao, Shuanglong, Zhenhonglong, and others, totaling one hundred and eighty people. For several months, they have been active near Niuyingzi. The Japanese and Korean immigrant merchants have suffered great harm and cannot stay. Also, since the Hebei Incident occurred, the anti-Japanese army group, led by Hou, led more than 100 troops, with unusually sufficient weapons and ammunition, and attacked Niuyingzi, Dabeigou, Xiaobeigou and other places in three routes. At that time, more than 50 Japanese and puppet police A were at the tea shed. Because of insufficient military strength, they retreated to Xiaoshan behind Niuyingzi. The anti-Japanese army occupied Niuyingzi and immediately set it on fire. At the same time, the anti-Japanese armies in Dabeigou and Xiaobeigou also burned down the puppet police station. While the burning was in full swing, it was already past 12:00. More than 100 Japanese Daoercheng punitive expeditionary forces arrived after hearing the news and fought fiercely with the anti-Japanese army. The anti-Japanese armies retreated from Niuyingzi and occupied the various mountains, still firing fiercely at the Japanese punitive expeditionary forces. The Japanese army suffered great damage. While they were in defeat, Li, the puppet police chief of SanShijiazi, and 50 mounted police arrived, carrying guns and two machine guns, and swept the anti-Japanese army from the Xiaoyin slope in front of Beiwazi. Fortunately, the anti-Japanese army was a skirmish line, and the terrain was very good. All of them were ambushed in the mountainous area and fought bravely. The Japanese and puppet troops and police were finally unable to support themselves and fled to Zhaojiagou. More than ten miles away from Niuyingzi, they were ambushed by the anti-Japanese army and attacked. By sunset, the Japanese and puppet troops and police had collapsed again towards Niangzigou. In this battle, more than 20 Japanese and puppet troops and police were killed and wounded, and many firearms were lost. One machine gun was captured by the anti-Japanese army. The anti-Japanese army also suffered considerable losses.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Fujian Raise Funds to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Both Xiamen and Zhangzhou are Underway; Zhangzhou and Quanzhou Have Executed Traitors One After Another</p>
<p>Xiamen News, Xiamen originally had two Japanese warships, Yubari and Wutake. On the morning of the 3rd, Wutake opened to Shantou. On the afternoon of the same day, two more ships, Hayate and Oite, came from Macau. Therefore, there are currently three Japanese warships docked in Xiamen. The Xiamen Anti-Enemy Support Association has been raising funds to resist the enemy recently, and the public is very enthusiastic. Among the three days from the 3rd to the 5th, the cloth merchants have already received more than 2,760 yuan, and more than 1,000 yuan from others, totaling more than 4,000 yuan. On the 5th, the association opened a fundraising meeting in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and resolved that: ㊀ The whole city will be divided and members will be responsible for soliciting donations. ㊁ The standing committees of the various trade associations will be responsible for soliciting donations from their members. ㊂ The whole city's shops will donate one month's rent, and mountain tenants will pay rent as a mortgage. ㊃ All institutions, organizations, schools, store staff, and store staff in the city will donate more than 20% of their one-month salary. ㊄ Banks, companies, overseas Chinese, and wealthy people will form special teams to solicit donations, and assign some people to seven area teams to solicit donations. This type of levy is estimated to reach 100,000 to 200,000 yuan for one month's rent alone.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Zhangzhou Emergency Security Committee, it issued a bulletin on the 2nd, stating, "The Japanese are oppressing us, North China is in danger, Zhangzhou is coastal, we should step up preparations and precautions. It has been decided by this meeting to raise a fund of 5,000 yuan, according to the standard of shop rent, a small levy of half a month for backup. " On the 5th, in order to unify the front line, the committee convened a meeting and resolved to rename the committee as the Zhangzhou Anti-Enemy Support Association, and strictly prohibit raising prices, raise relief preparation funds, and hire the newly formed captain of the Zhangzhou Volunteer Army and the air defense committee member. The organization of the Support Association is divided into six departments: general affairs, finance, organization, intelligence, rescue, and relief. In addition, the Zhangzhou garrison executed four traitors on the 5th, namely Liu Guan, You Gen, Huang Jianshi (Huang Tianqiao), and Zhou Qixiang. Their crimes were either using foreigners to smuggle tax evasion and sell drugs, or acting as spies for the enemy, luring fugitive soldiers, intending to disrupt public order, and endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Also, the Quanzhou garrison also executed traitor Xu Changgen on the same day. His crimes were selling drugs, colluding with foreigners, and spying on military information. (August 6th)</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Catastrophic Flood</h3>
<p>Heavy Rains for Days Turn the City into a Swamp; Tens of Thousands Homeless Due to Collapsed Houses</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Dispatch: Since the beginning of summer, Zheng County has had favorable rainfall, leading to lush autumn crops. After a severe drought, farmers were hoping for a bountiful autumn harvest to sustain their remaining lives. Unexpectedly, starting from the 31st of last month, heavy rains fell continuously for eight days, turning the area into another catastrophe. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rainfall Situation</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st of last month, torrential rain began suddenly, stopping only at night. The 1st of this month remained overcast. On the 2nd at noon, a sudden gale erupted, followed by torrential rain, which gradually stopped on the morning of the 3rd. At once, ditches and rivers were overflowing, causing significant disaster. On the 4th, sporadic rain continued. At 1:00 AM on the 5th, the wind intensified suddenly, and torrential rain fell again, gradually ceasing at 5:00 AM on the 6th. At 10:00 PM that evening, thunder rumbled again, and torrential rain poured down, even more violently than before, stopping only on the morning of the 7th. On the 7th and 8th, overcast and rainy conditions persisted, with occasional showers. All the rivers in the region were simultaneously swollen by mountain floods. The countryside was flooded, and the city was turned into a swamp. In the eastern and northern villages, the water was over ten feet deep, with only the treetops exposed. Houses were either collapsed or leaking, and shanties were completely washed away. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the cause of this torrential storm was the passage of a typhoon, which made landfall in Zhejiang, through the Henan Province, causing a serious impact. It has since dissipated after passing through Henan.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation</p>
<p>As a result of the continuous river overflow and rain erosion, uprooted trees and collapsed houses were everywhere. During the rain, the streets and lanes near the river accumulated four feet of water. Those affected by the water temporarily piled up sandbags to prevent flooding, but many were still washed away, flooding houses. Goods and furniture were completely destroyed, and commercial activity came to a standstill. The north gate of the county town was surrounded by water for three days. Outside the city, the water was over ten feet deep, a vast expanse. Dozens of floating corpses were found in the rivers. More than a dozen people were crushed to death by collapsing walls. Many environment, telephone, and telegraph poles were toppled, and communications were cut off for several days. Repairs are now being expedited. According to a survey, in just one corner of the Third Police Precinct, 2,742 houses collapsed, totaling 7,035 rooms, affecting 8,287 residents, with 3,500 homeless. The estimated loss is 130,000 yuan. In the entire city, approximately 15,000 houses collapsed, with 20,000 victims awaiting relief, and over 3,000 households, totaling over 10,000 people, homeless. In Heyang Street, only one out of 180 households survived. The severity of the disaster is truly rare. The police department, recognizing that the people of Zheng City have suffered such a catastrophe and have nowhere to turn, has ordered its subordinate precincts to investigate the victims and immediately establish over a dozen shelters to await relief. The Red Swastika Society has only over 2,000 yuan in savings, which is insufficient for the need. It is seeking to raise several thousand yuan from chambers of commerce and other organizations to provide emergency assistance.</p>
<p>Hopeless Autumn Harvest</p>
<p>This heavy rain was widespread in Henan Province. Dozens of counties, including Gongxian, Zhongmu, Kaifeng, Yancheng, Anyang, Fanshui, Wu'an, Wuzhi, Nanyang, Linru, Yanshi, Guangwu, Tangyin, Linzhang, etc., have suffered catastrophe. With torrential rains lasting for days, mountain floods erupted, and rivers overflowed everywhere. Following the severe drought and locust plague, now comes disaster from wind and rain. The autumn harvest is now declared hopeless. The disaster-ridden rural areas of Henan are on the verge of collapse. The livelihood of millions of disaster victims is in peril. Therefore, aid from all parties is urgently needed. (August 8th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Planning Local Assistance Association</p>
<p>The local Commissioner's Office recently ordered all counties to establish local assistance associations. The county government, upon receiving the order, invited local figures to Haishi Hall at 10:00 AM on the 10th to hold the first committee meeting. Over twenty people attended.

<p>Collapse of Baimao Sluice Embankment</p>
<p>The Baimao Estuary west of Luhuo City in the county was planned and constructed last year by the National Economic Council with a sluice gate and a large dam built inside the old dike to block the area near the gate. All the water in the dike was channeled north through the gate. After completion, the water level at Baimao was well regulated, and counties along Tai Lake and villages beside the dike benefited significantly. Unexpectedly, the dam was damaged by strong winds and waves some days ago, and recently, the tidal surge rose suddenly, collapsing the dam overnight. The gate lost its effectiveness, and flood tides poured into the inland river, turning low-lying areas into swamps and submerging nearby farmland.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Fire Drill Held</p>
<p>The fire brigade of the county's defense corps held a training ceremony at Zhongshan Hall at 2:00 PM on the 8th. Over two hundred trainee members from various districts attended.

The parents only found out on the morning of the 8th. Upon inspection, the military uniforms and training graduation certificates that each had prepared were all missing. It is understood that the four had recently graduated from the Central People's School in the county. No letters were left behind this time. However, according to friends of Mao and Zhang, they often discussed national affairs with others with a sense of indignation and purpose. However, their families are already trying to find them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish Shelters for Women and Children</p>
<p>The Wu County Relief Committee has begun planning to establish shelters for women and children in rural areas, with locations in Mudu, Shanren Bridge, Guangfu, Xihua, Xiangshan, etc., which are more convenient for transportation and relatively safe.

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Wang Wenhan Volunteers to Fight the Enemy</p>
<p>Wang Wenhan, chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, recently proposed to resign from his positions as chairman and standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce due to the severity of the national crisis and the deepening threat from the enemy. He resolved to volunteer to fight the enemy to the highest military leader. Although local officials in this port have unanimously tried to persuade him to stay, Wang's determination is so firm that they fear they will not be able to stop his lofty aspiration.</p>

Unexpectedly, while en route, they were attacked by sea salt pirates. After someone notified boat owner Zhang Wanqing, he immediately reported to the naval and land military police, requesting pursuit. However, there has been no news to date.</p>
<h3>Cixi</h3>
<p>Designated Temple to Sound Alarms</p>
<p>Cixi County is an important coastal national defense area in Zhejiang Province.

The county government has specifically designated the temples within the county to strike their bells as air raid sirens. They are not allowed to be struck during peacetime to avoid misunderstandings. All temples, public security bureaus, and people from all walks of life have been notified to ensure that everyone is aware.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>

<p>In addition to arresting two suspects on the 29th and 30th of last month, Xiaoshan arrested another suspect, Wang Peiyi, on the 6th of this month by the river, and arrested Chen Huarong and eight others in Kanshan on the 7th. It was also reported that two suspects were arrested in Qiu. After interrogation, one person was released due to lack of major suspicion, and the rest were transferred to the Security Area Commander for handling.</p>

<h3>Unfortunate Incident at Hongqiao Airport: Both Sides Investigating the Truth</h3>
<p>Both Sides Maintain an Impartial Attitude During Yesterday's Investigation; However, There Are Many Differences in Their Points of View; Japanese Naval Attaché Urges Residents to Remain Calm; Japanese News Agency Report Does Not Match the Truth</p>
<p>Regarding the unfortunate incident at Hongqiao Airport, both sides conducted investigations yesterday to determine the truth. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Comments</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese news agency's reports, which deviate far from the truth, reporters visited Mayor Yu to inquire about everything. Mayor Yu replied that the case is currently under thorough investigation by both sides, and he did not want to express any opinions. However, he had already detailed the circumstances of the unfortunate incident when he visited Japanese Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai last night. In short, if both sides adopt an impartial attitude and conduct an on-site investigation, it should not be difficult to ascertain the truth. At that time, the matter can be resolved satisfactorily through diplomatic channels.</p>
<p>Investigation Underway</p>
<p>Yesterday, both sides agreed to investigate the truth. The Chinese side included Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Zhou Yongneng, Secretary Zhang Tingrong, Adjutant Zhao Weixian of the Garrison Command, and Chief of the Supervisory Section of the Public Security Bureau Wang Dasui, etc. The Japanese side was mainly composed of Major Yamanouchi Eiichi, staff officer of the Naval Landing Forces, along with Lieutenant Commander Tajiri Yuzuru, Naval Attaché, Consul Yoshioka Hanmu from the Shanghai Consulate General, Secretary Fukui, Police Officer Okumura Giichiro, Ensign Higashikawa Yoshinobu of the Military Police, and over ten Japanese reporters, etc. The Public Concession Police also sent Detective West Dong En, Detective Head Hui Situo, Japanese Detective Iguchi, Inspector Kasudoji, and Shibuya Umezo to participate. The group gathered at the Japanese Consulate General at 8:00 AM and arrived at the scene of the incident at Hongqiao Airport at 9:00 AM to conduct an on-site investigation, studying the route taken by the car, the locations of the soldiers killed on both sides, and bullets in great detail. The investigation was completed at around 5:00 PM. Afterwards, the group went to the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters to inspect the car used by the soldiers involved in the incident. During the investigation, both sides maintained an impartial attitude and conducted a thorough study, so there were no fierce debates. However, there were many differences in the viewpoints of the two sides, so negotiations were not proposed yesterday.</p>
<p>Truth of the Case</p>
<p>The deceased in this unfortunate incident were Shi Jingzhe, a soldier from the airport guard unit on the Chinese side, and Lieutenant Commander Oyama Isao and soldier Saito Yozo on the Japanese side. According to the reporter's investigation, Shi Jingzhe was shot twice, both entering from the right rib on the back and exiting from the right front chest. His body was lying about one hundred meters from the gate of Hongqiao Airport. Oyama Isao was killed several hundred meters away from that location. Therefore, the truth of the incident is very clear. It is evident that Japanese soldiers were driving a car from east to west, attempting to break into the gate of Hongqiao Airport. They were stopped by the guards. From 150 meters away, Saito Yozo fired a shot. At that time, the guards crouched down to avoid the fire. Then, the car turned north and headed towards Bifang Road. At that time, Shi Jingzhe, a guard unit soldier about one hundred meters from the gate of the airport, heard the gunshot and tried to return to report. He was shot twice by Japanese soldiers and fell to the ground and died. At the same time, nearby security soldiers, alerted by the gunfire, came out to patrol. The Japanese soldiers continued to fire, so the soldiers fired back, killing Oyama at the scene and seriously injuring Saito. Saito ran several hundred steps but died due to his injuries. Therefore, the report of the incident released by the Japanese news agency is based on conjecture and cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Deceased</p>
<p>The body of Shi Jingzhe, a soldier of our guard unit, was examined yesterday by doctors appointed by both sides, who filled out the injury report and took photos for record. The Chinese side has also scheduled an autopsy at the Forensic Medicine Institute this morning. As for the Japanese soldiers who died, the Japanese side considered it unnecessary to perform an autopsy, so they were cremated at the Baziqiao Crematorium at 7:00 PM last night. A large number of Japanese soldiers attended. The Chinese side was notified in advance to inform nearby residents to avoid panic and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Resolution</p>
<p>Both sides have agreed to resolve the case through diplomatic channels. However, since the investigation was not completed yesterday, negotiations have not yet begun. Also, Japanese Naval Attaché Honda gave a speech to residents in Shanghai yesterday to avoid escalation of the situation, asking them to remain calm and trust the authorities to seek a resolution.</p>
<p>Japanese Meeting</p>
<p>It is reported that after the incident on the previous evening, the Japanese side held a meeting at the consulate on Huangpu Road that night to discuss countermeasures. Consul General Okamoto, Consul Yoshioka, Tami, and Naval Attaché Honda and Assistant Attaché Okino, Army Assistant Attaché Sakata all participated. As a result, a telegram was immediately sent to the Japanese government in Tokyo to request instructions. The embassy's Naval Attaché Honda went to the consulate again at 11:00 AM yesterday to meet with Consul General Okamoto and continue discussions. Many other officials also participated in the discussion. Also, regarding this matter, both sides are in the process of investigation. There was no formal diplomatic action yesterday. However, Japanese Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai visited Police Commissioner General Everson at the Public Works Department in the morning to discuss something.</p>
<p>Okino's Statement</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Japanese Naval Attaché Okino in Shanghai yesterday morning. According to the interview, although the matter is very serious, after Mayor Yu and Consul General Okamoto, Attaché Honda, and himself met last night (i.e., the previous night), they decided to seek a reasonable resolution through normal diplomatic channels, and it should not escalate.</p>
<h3>Cultural Circles Advocate Resistance and National Salvation</h3>
<p>Cultural Circles Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association held its third executive board meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Chairman Zhou Jianyun and the heads of various departments reported on the work situation.

Xie Liuyi, Hu Yuzhi, and Zhou Hanmei were designated to draft a telegram and send it out immediately. The telegram said: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Chairman Chiang, Vice Chairman Feng, Chairman Wang, and all ministers and heads of the Yuan and Committees: Since the enemy is using the pretext of war to invade our Pingjin, in addition to actively increasing troops and making further encroachments, it is also engaging in malicious propaganda to international organizations and foreign newspapers in an attempt to subvert the facts and mislead international opinion. At this time when a full-scale war of resistance is being launched, international propaganda is extremely important. If we allow them to spread lies at will, it will greatly affect the work of national salvation. Therefore, after a joint meeting of our association, it was resolved to submit a request to the central government to quickly stop the enemy's malicious propaganda, and to announce accurate information to all countries and supply it to international news organizations in order to correct international public opinion. We respectfully submit this telegram and request your approval for implementation. We eagerly look forward to it. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union, the Second Special District Citizens' Union, the South Shanghai District Citizens' Union, and the North Shanghai District Citizens' Union respectfully submit this request.</p>

<h3>Shanghai People Flee Shanghai to the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>About 100,000 People Depart from Ningbo; Shanghai-Ningbo Steamships Return to Normal</p>
<p>The situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly tense. Factories in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas are also being closed one after another. Unemployed workers have nothing to live on and are taking their families back to their hometowns. According to statistics from various transportation companies, about 100,000 to 110,000 people have returned to Ningbo in the past week. If even young children are included, the number may be even higher. However, since yesterday, the number of merchants traveling from Shanghai to Yong has decreased significantly. Sanbei, Ningshao, China Merchants, etc., have all returned to normal, the midday flights have been suspended, and each transportation company has stopped operating daily and has resumed the previous single and double schedule. The evening schedule remains the same. In addition, with the withdrawal of Japanese expatriates and the Japanese navy from the Yangtze River, the general middle-class and above people in Shanghai believe that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Changsha, and other places, are safe areas, and are moving to the Yangtze River one after another. In the past two days, the number of passengers on various Yangtze River ships from Shanghai to the Yangtze River has been extremely crowded. All of the berths for the next few days have also been booked. In addition, a large number of piece goods have been shipped from Shanghai to various ports along the Yangtze River in recent days, mostly loaded on British merchant ships. The shipping fee must be paid in cash, and the freight rate is extremely expensive. It is even said that the freight collected by a ship to Hankou is about 100,000 yuan, which is truly shocking.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers in the Lu Deming Case Sentenced</h3>
<p>Lu Deming, the younger brother of rickshaw merchant Lu Delin, is only nine years old. He lives at No. 1, Lane 59, Rehe Road. At around 7:00 AM on June 23 of this year, when Deming was accompanied by his maid, Zhu Jinshi, to Nanyang Primary School nearby, he was suddenly kidnapped by robbers. Subsequently, Chinese detectives Shang Wu and Li Wenbin of the Hui Division captured two kidnappers, Zhou Changgui and Lu Shougao, and the victim, Lu Deming, was also released by the kidnappers and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. The hearing has ended, and the sentencing is awaited. As reported in this newspaper, Judge Chuan Lin of the trial court ascended the bench to announce the verdict.

<h3>A Guest Commits Suicide in Longsheng Inn</h3>
<p>A Suicide Note States He Was Forced by the Environment and Had No Choice but to Resort to This Tactic</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, a man went to Longsheng Inn at No. 6, Lane 446, Fuzhou Road, and booked Room 30. He wrote his name as Chen Dehua, 32 years old, from Wuxi, in the circulation book. By the 8th, it was not known what stimulus he had received that suddenly gave rise to thoughts of ending his life. He secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Subsequently, tea servant Hua Qianshi discovered it and reported it to the Old Gate Police Station, who summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at the latest at 10:00 AM the next day. After an investigation, the police found a graduation certificate for a student soldier of the 4th Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Infantry and a graduation certificate for the Jiangsu Provincial Intelligence Squad Leader Training Class, both in the name of Chen Tianlong. Therefore, Chen Dehua may be his alias. There was also a suicide note addressed to the inn, which stated that he was forced by the environment and had no choice but to resort to this tactic. The body was sent to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Song Genchu, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special Court, went to the morgue to verify the identity of the body. He was released after verifying that the deceased was Chen Tianlong (i.e. Chen Dehua), male, and died of opium poisoning during his lifetime. Before the relatives of the deceased are found, the body will be handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection. The relics will be sent to the police station and stored in the court, waiting for the relatives of the deceased to claim them.</p>

<p>Investigated by Customs</p>
<p>Ai Zimin from Xuzhou, who lives at No. 40 Xinmaodeli Lane, Mahe Road, previously partnered with Zhao Jifu and others to open the Dekang Company near Shandong Road on Fuzhou Road.

We and Gonggan are colleagues, and we are really angry and anxious. Japan is our enemy wearing a friendly mask, not only wanting to annex the entire China, but also disrupting world peace, especially harming the culture of mankind. As reported in the newspapers, Nankai University was bombed, and Tsinghua University was invaded. There are also reports of the arrest, abuse, and massacre of professors and students in the Pingjin area, but the news is blocked, and the tragic situation is unclear. We want to seek survival for the nation and justice for mankind. For the enemy who invades our nation and the scourge of mankind who destroys civilization, we must declare to the people of the country, we must inform the world (including cultural workers in Japan), and express our greatest determination to eliminate this national enemy and eliminate this scourge of mankind. At the same time, this is also our greatest concern for Mr. Wang Gonggan, who serves culture and is not afraid of sacrifice, and for the abused cultural figures in the Pingjin area, and even for all the cultural institutions in the ancient capital struggling in cruelty."</p>

Zhao Shunqing, along with his assistants Yu Youliang, Yao Gen, and Yuan Rong, went to the factory at 3:00 PM on the 4th of this month to settle accounts with Ren Yingshi for a total of 1,262 yuan. However, Zhao Shunqing's calculation showed a loss of 200 yuan, leading to a dispute. Yao Gen, known for his violent temper, was extremely dissatisfied and said to Ren, "You should be careful, you'll be seeing colors soon," and left angrily. Ren Yingshi didn't pay it much mind. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 6th, Ren was on his way to the factory when he was attacked from behind by thugs near the Zhoushan Road market. He was struck in the head with an iron instrument and fell to the ground, suffering severe injuries. Detective Xie Wanfang of the Xulin Road police station, along with Officer No. 1845, rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. An ambulance was called, and Ren was sent to Sacred Heart Hospital, where he died at midnight despite treatment. The body was taken to the Fielun Road morgue for examination. The assailant fled without a trace and has not yet been apprehended. The day before yesterday, Detective Xie Wanfang, who was handling the case, learned that Zhao Shunqing, the cook who had contracted to provide the meals, was a major suspect. He was arrested. Yu Youliang lived at No. 6 Zhoujiapai Road. Officers rushed there to arrest him but could not find him. His nine-year-old son Yu Maogen was taken to the police station. Zhao was sent to the First Special District Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan explained the case and requested an extension of the investigation. Zhao Shunqing was questioned and completely denied participating in or instigating the attack. According to the child Yu Maogen, he knew Zhao and his son Dongdong. The night before, a man named Gu Ying invited his father Yu Youliang out, saying it was about a fight, but he didn't go. Later, Gu reported to his father that a cook in the yarn factory had been beaten to death. The child was young and his testimony was vague. Judge Zhong Ji ordered Zhao to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Old Father Accuses Son and Daughter-in-Law of Abandonment, Injury, and Encroachment</h3>
<p>Due to Lack of Sufficient Evidence, Judge Acquits Son and Daughter-in-Law After Admonishment</p>
<p>Jin Xusheng, a resident of Chuansha, 65 years old, recently filed a lawsuit in the First District Court accusing his son Jin Dechang (32 years old, residing at No. 17 Xiangfu Lane, Kader Road, working as a clerk at the telephone company) and his daughter-in-law Jin Xue (34 years old) of abandonment, injury, and encroachment. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Shan Feng in the Second Criminal Court. According to Jin Xusheng, his son Chang works for a foreign firm and has been unemployed for five years. "Jin Dechang is my son, whom I raised and educated from a young age. He now earns more than a hundred yuan a month, yet he doesn't treat me as his father. Not only does he not support me, but he also occupies the house at No. 17 Xiangfu Lane, which I originally rented, and has evicted me. On the first of this month, he even instigated his wife to beat me at home in Xiangfu Lane and looted all my savings over the years. I can no longer endure it and have no choice but to sue your court, requesting severe punishment as a warning for the future," he said. The court immediately inquired whether he had any proof of his claims, to which he could not provide sufficient evidence, only stating that "I am an old man, and they have the power. No one is willing to help me." Questioned, Jin Dechang stated, "My father originally lived in Shanghai. After the January 28th Incident, he returned to our old home at No. 51 South Gate Street in Chuansha with my mother and my wife. All expenses, approximately 50 yuan per month, are borne by me. Although I earn 115 yuan a month, various legitimate expenses are still not enough, let alone having extra money for my father's use. As for the house in Xiangfu Lane, there are still rooms available for my father to live in, but my father himself doesn't want to come. There are other reasons why he doesn't want to come, but as a son, I don't want to say them." As for the accusation that he instigated his wife to injure his father, he said, "It's completely unfounded. In short, all my father's accusations are not true." Jin Xue also denied beating her father-in-law and hired lawyer Tang Hao to defend her. Judge Zhong, after reviewing the testimonies, immediately announced the verdict in court: Jin Dechang and Jin Xue were both found not guilty, and the plaintiff's related civil suit was dismissed. After the verdict, he advised the two defendants, "Today, because your father's accusations lack evidence, you are acquitted. But if you hadn't gone against filial piety, your father wouldn't have filed a lawsuit. Therefore, although you are acquitted today, you must strive to fulfill your filial duties in the future, and the family will naturally be harmonious. There will never be the disgraceful event of father and son going to court again." Jin Dechang repeatedly affirmed this. However, Jin Xusheng expressed his dissatisfaction and said he would appeal.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Central Bank to Proceed After Kong Returns</h3>
<p>Increase in Commercial Shares Fully Subscribed</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a concrete implementation plan and is actively preparing. According to a report by a Dagongshe reporter, the first step in the reorganization of the Central Bank, in accordance with the revised Central Bank Law, is to increase commercial shares by 40 million yuan. This amount has now been fully subscribed. The reorganization procedures are still under detailed planning by the Ministry of Finance. It will proceed after President Kong returns to the country. Because the reorganization of the bank is to complete the established policy of the new currency system, the future is extremely important. In order to consolidate the entire financial foundation of the country after the implementation of the new currency system, it is necessary to promote the independent status of the Central Bank. Therefore, although the current situation is becoming increasingly serious, the reorganization of the Central Bank will not be affected and will continue.</p>

<p>Historical Figures</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Words</h3>
<p>When Feng Yuxiang was in his hometown of Chaoxian, he gave a speech to the soldiers of the local security team, criticizing the military, which was enough to awaken the deaf. He said:</p>
<p>"When we gather, bowing to the portrait of the Prime Minister not only shows respect for the Prime Minister, but also shows repentance to the Prime Minister. Why? Because isn't one of the Prime Minister's legacies that we should "abolish unequal treaties"? But at present, not only have they not been abolished, but they are increasing day by day, and even the land in the Northeast has been lost. Isn't this a shame for us soldiers?</p>
<p>In general, people are proud to wear military uniforms, but whenever I put on a military uniform, I always feel endless shame. Look: people keep a dog, and it can guard the door for its owner; raise a cat, and it can catch mice for its owner; even a pig, if fattened, can be sold for money. But the common people use their hard-earned money to support us soldiers, who are not enough to defend against the enemy above, and not enough to protect the people below. How can we face our compatriots, and how can we comfort the Prime Minister's spirit in heaven?</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you must know: one day the lost land is not recovered, one day the unequal treaties are not abolished, one day our soldiers' responsibilities are not lifted, and one day the shame is not washed away! Work hard! Soldiers of the Republic of China!"</p>

<h3>General Hu Zongnan</h3>
<p>— Han Ren</p>
<p>"The Xiongnu are not destroyed, how can I make a home?"</p>
<p>Young General Hu Zongnan, known as the Iron Commander, has made outstanding contributions to bandit suppression in recent years, which is why Chairman Chiang Kai-shek relies on him greatly. As a result, Hu's troops' uniforms and armaments are also more excellent, and the strength of the military appearance is enough to overwhelm everything. Hu's ability to be called the cornerstone of the Central Army with Generals Chen Cheng and Liu Zhi is also due to his intelligence and ability to win every battle. However, Hu is over thirty years old. Under the early marriage customs in China, he should have been married long ago, not to mention those who hold high positions and hold prominent positions, who invariably recruit concubines as a means of adjustment. However, Hu is not like that. He still adheres to the bachelor's life. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once advised him to choose a spouse early, and friends from all sides also acted as matchmakers, intending to bring together a marriage, but Hu always refused, saying: "The Xiongnu have not been reduced, how can I make a home?" Only after I have repaid my great ambition to serve the country can I marry and have children: enjoy family fun." Those who heard it admired him endlessly. Also, Hu is usually clean and self-disciplined in the army, and can share weal and woe with his soldiers, so his subordinates respect and support him, and it is no accident that he can repeatedly build special merits.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Shen Junru</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>Among the seven gentlemen recently accused of endangering the Republic of China, who have aroused the attention of people all over the country, Mr. Shen Junru, in his early years, followed the Prime Minister in revolutionary work. During the Xinhai Revolution, when he was working as a penman for a major newspaper in Beijing; when Yuan Shikai was making a farce of the Hongxian dream, Shen wrote a current affairs poem in his own edited newspaper: "Some enter the siege, dragging out the old ape to return my country, I tour the road, unbearable to look back and recall the future." It contains painful criticism and satirical colors. Yuan was furious when he saw it and ordered the newspaper to be sealed; on the one hand, he sent someone to arrest him.</p>
<p>However, Shen stood up and out and was not afraid. No matter what sweet words they used to seduce him, or what force they used to threaten him, he always refused to yield, did not fear, and took his own words to intimidate him.</p>
<p>Later, Xiangcheng could not detain him, and after being explained, he released Shen, but the unyielding spirit can also be selected into the anecdotes of journalists and circulated.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fo-hai Advocates "Unified Civil-Military Education"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Junyuan</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, has been working hard for the party and the country for years, and his contributions are great. In his various works, we can see the breadth and depth of his knowledge. The rapid progress of education in Jiangsu Province in recent years is the crystallization of his careful planning and hard work.</p>
<p>Last month, he attended the opening ceremony of the Jiangsu Student Training Corps and vigorously advocated a "unified civil-military education" in his speech, which roughly meant:</p>
<p>In ancient times, our country was a combination of civil and military skills, such as the six arts of Zhou Guanbao's clan, rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics, which were the implementation of civil-military education. Later generations divided civil and military paths, which led to the weakening of the nation and the decline of the country.</p>
<p>There are many examples of countries and nations declining due to the separation of civil and military affairs. In our country, the Song Dynasty perished in the Jianyuan Dynasty because of its emphasis on civil affairs and neglect of military affairs. The Yuan Dynasty perished in the Ming Dynasty because of its emphasis on military affairs and neglect of civil affairs. The Warring States period was accompanied by the fall of ancient Rome by the Germanic people, which was also due to the emphasis on civil affairs and neglect of military affairs.</p>
<p>Under the current severe situation, we must advocate unified civil-military education. The archery in the former six arts is archery, and we must now help to practice the shooting of guns and artillery: the former charioteering is driving, and we must now learn to drive airplanes and tanks.</p>
<p>Students! Let us practice a strong physique, learn skilled tactics, rush to the front line of national rejuvenation, and drive out our evil enemies!</p>
<h3>Wang Liangchou Loves to Eat Melon Seeds</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Former President of the Executive Yuan Wang Liangchou, in addition to going to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to review routine official duties every day, spends the rest of his time with legislator Jian Youwen. Jian once used the pseudonym of Dahuya Martyr to compile Southeast Wind and publish it in magazines such as The Human World. Recently, he revived the publication of Yijing in Shanghai with legislator Feng Ziyou, collecting historical materials from before and after the Republic of China to fill the pages. Liangchou joined the army and made revolution in his early years. He was always familiar with the historical achievements of the revolution, so Jian always asked Liangchou to write articles. Liangchou had repeatedly declined the invitation due to busy government affairs in the past. Recently, with more leisure in government affairs, Jian's residence is often seen with Liangchou sitting and talking, tirelessly.</p>
<p>Liangchou loves to eat melon seeds and is known as a "melon seed king". When he was studying in the UK in the past, he wrote the book "Criminal Law". Every time he wrote an article, he had to place black melon seeds on the desk, peeling and writing, the melon seed shell marks filled the floor in his room. On top of it, the sound was loud. After the book was completed, the melon seeds that were eaten could not be calculated in pounds. People in the study abroad circle named the book "Melon Seed Criminal Law", which was a popular story for a while. Even now, the habit has not subsided. Jian knows his preferences, so every time Liangchou comes, he must buy a lot of melon seeds to entertain him. Liangchou loves the five-spiced melon seeds that are popular in Beijing and Shanghai the most, followed by pumpkin seeds. He does not like red melon seeds at all.</p>
<p>Corrigendum The sentence "Let's get up together to save Peiping and Tianjin" in the twenty-fifth line of "Peiping-Tianjin Elegy" on Monday should be arranged after "Rubbing our fists and rolling up our sleeves and sharpening our swords", hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Statement The article "Reminiscing Huang Yingbai" published in this journal on July 28 was found to be slightly inconsistent with the facts and is hereby declared.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>— Li Qian</p>
<p>“Extraordinary times” means times that are not ordinary.</p>
<p>At this turn of summer into autumn, more disasters are lurking before our eyes! Poisonous bacteria will continue their remaining power, vicious mosquitoes will spread malaria, and dysentery, amoebic dysentery… will rage and become prevalent. It can truly be said to be "extraordinary times!"</p>
<p>To defend against these disasters, we should deal with them separately: Regularly using "Yalinsaer" solution to disinfect and kill bacteria, burning "Wuzhou Hollow" mosquito coils to exterminate mosquitoes, and taking "Anlisheng" pills to treat and prevent dysentery are all effective methods.</p>
<h3>Female Warriors</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>The new women of the new China should all do work to save the country and be female warriors who kill the enemy!</p>
<p>However, women's physical constitutions are often not as strong as men's, because women often suffer from conditions such as physical weakness and blood deficiency.</p>
<p>Therefore, if women want not to fall behind men, they must actively exercise and strive to strengthen themselves. If they have internal illnesses, those suffering from menstrual irregularities can purchase and take the miraculous medicine "Yuè Yuè Hóng" which promotes menstruation and invigorates blood. Those suffering from physical weakness and blood deficiency can purchase and take the nourishing and replenishing tonic "Nü Jie Shi." This way, they can reach a state of health and strength.</p>
<h3>The Charitable Passerby</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in the early part of the month, I was walking on the road when I suddenly saw a newspaper vendor fall to the ground, trembling all over. In an instant, many people gathered around to watch, all saying that the newspaper vendor had suffered from heatstroke!</p>
<p>At this time, a person came out from the crowd. He took out a small bottle from his side and poured some medicine into the newspaper vendor's mouth. After a while, the newspaper vendor became conscious and thanked the person who gave him the medicine.</p>
<p>The person said, "This medicine is 'Tiangong Shui' from Wuzhou Pharmacy. It is a very effective medicine for heatstroke. I always carry it with me in case of emergency. Today, it saved a life, and I am also very happy."</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Yarn Market Re-Enters Sluggish Path Due to Impact of Sanpin</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for a week, is now being dragged into a sluggish state due to the influence of the decline in world cotton prices. In fact, prices had already risen by thirteen or fourteen yuan compared to the low, slightly improved from the unfavorable situation, and a sudden reaction occurred. The current yarn situation remains as lively as usual, with buyers from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Hunan, and other provinces continuing to purchase steadily. Therefore, the spot and futures yarn markets are diverging. Spot yarn prices remain stable, with the difference between futures and spot prices exceeding ten yuan. However, credit conditions are tighter, and Osaka Sanpin yarn is frequently declining. It has long been rumored that Japanese factories are preparing to suspend production starting from the fifteenth.</p>
<p>More Significant Decline in Forward Yarn</p>
<p>The opening price of futures yarn in the previous market rose by one yuan this month, but when trading in distant months, it suddenly trended downward. With the consistent decline in world cotton prices, and the severe downward trend, market sentiment became softer, with declines ranging from four yuan forty cents to four yuan twenty cents. After the second session, it was heard that spot yarn demand was robust, and profit-takers engaged in covering activities, leading to a renewed upward trend. However, market trading remained quiet, with only 4,500 bales traded. The final results showed that prices for all months fell by two yuan ten cents to two yuan ninety cents compared to the previous day's closing price, except for this month, which fell by only sixty cents. Sales included 1,500 bales by Juxing, 150 bales by Taixing, 400 bales by Xingchang, 400 bales by Senkang, 150 bales by Hengde, 150 bales by Renfeng, 150 bales by Shenji, 700 bales by Runkang, and 150 bales by Shengyuan. Purchases included 150 bales by Mingde, 300 bales by Qingda, 350 bales by Tongfeng, 1,100 bales by Changfeng, 400 bales by Dachang, 300 bales by Tonghe, 100 bales by Yuanda, and 100 bales by Taichang. The highest and lowest prices for the half-day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>No Change in Spot Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have become more active. Statistics show that various provinces purchased a total of 1,699 bales throughout the day, with no significant changes in prices. Purchase amounts by province are listed below.</p>
<h3>Futures Cotton Hit by American Cotton</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth prices turned downward and the market momentum weakened, due to the estimated increase in American cotton production by a massive 3,113,000 bales compared to the previous year. Southern cotton farmers engaged in large-scale hedging sales, causing market prices to fall. World cotton markets declined across the board, with Indian cotton unofficial trading plummeting by over ten rupees. The local market situation remains calm. Prices for all months briefly broke through the 40-yuan mark, but short covering led to a rebound. However, the overall situation remains weak.</p>
<p>New Cotton Follows the Decline by Sixty or Seventy Cents</p>
<p>The opening price of futures cotton in the previous market declined because the U.S. government's production estimate was announced as 15,593,000 bales, an increase of 3,116,000 bales compared to the previous year. Market prices fell by 42 pounds per ton. Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 1.45 yuan. Market sentiment was shaken, and there was a surge in profit-taking, but new sellers were not yet active. Prices for all months broke through the 40-yuan mark, followed by a gradual recovery due to profit-takers covering their positions. However, trading was not active, with only 6,500 dan traded. The final results showed that prices for all months fell by 4.5 to 6.7 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. Sales included 600 dan by Dafeng, 1,100 dan by Zhenda, 500 dan by Taixing, 700 dan by Taichang, 1,400 dan by Runkang, 500 dan by Shengyuan, and 400 dan by Fukang.

The highest and lowest prices for the half-day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Remains Quiet</p>
<p>Factories have no intention of buying spot cotton, actually because the national crisis is severe and there is no intention of stockpiling. Most adopt a "buy one bale when you use one bale" policy. Only Yong'an Factory purchased 310 pieces. There were no arrivals at the docks.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet 42.75, Yong'an Factory purchases 3 pieces, delivered from the current goods warehouse.</p>
<p>Cotton Production Estimated to Increase Significantly, American Cotton Plummets by Over 40 Pounds per Ton</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher. News from Liverpool was favorable, with excessive rainfall in the east and continued dry heat in the west. Prices for all months rose by 3 to 8 pounds per ton. Subsequently, with the release of the government report, production was estimated to increase significantly, triggering mass selling and profit-taking. Market prices fell sharply. During the price decline, industry participants and Bombay brokers made purchases. Later, news of the possible early realization of cotton loans led to another rebound. Weather forecasts indicated cloudy and rainy conditions in the east, thunderstorms in the center, and favorable conditions in the west. The closing was stable. Spot prices fell by 42 pounds per ton, and futures prices fell by 28 to 42 pounds per ton. British cotton spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices fell by 22 to 23 points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to short covering, but then weakened due to the decline in Japanese yarn. Finally, due to the short covering before the release of the American cotton report, market prices rose again. Pingguoer rose by 1.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 1 rupee, and Bailuoxi rose by 0.75 to 1 rupee. The original telegram is listed on the left (dated the 9th).</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>96 Bonds Drop Alone by Six Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market continued to be dull, with bulls and bears remaining in a stalemate. There were sporadic reports of September contracts, but most were still listed at the official price. Retail investors found it extremely difficult to liquidate their positions. The quietness on the trading floor was rare since the issue of the Unified Bonds. The future is uncertain due to the large number of outstanding contracts. The trading process for the Unified Bonds showed no changes, with extremely clear transactions. The September contracts were all bought in at number six. The 96 Bonds, however, were sold off by bulls, falling sharply by six cents and showing signs of weakness. The results for the entire day showed that only the 96 Bonds fell by six cents. The total transaction volume was estimated at 905,000 yuan, with 435,000 yuan in 96 Bonds. The table is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

Due to the impact of the current situation, all cloth factories have a large amount of inventory on hand. The factories in the Chinese concession of Wuhu are about to suspend work due to the relocation of workers. It is rumored that factories in Wuxi and Changzhou are also considering suspending production.</p>
<h3>Brief Market Report</h3>
<p>▲New Soybean Market Vigor Regains Yesterday, the new soybean market benefited from the momentum of the previous day, achieving a rebound. Prices for high-quality goods rose by 4 to 5 cents, while prices for medium-quality goods remained stable due to the influx of goods. Sales continued with Fuzhou, Guangdong, Ningbo, and local buyers purchasing 1,500 bags of Sanyang soybeans, 800 bags of Jiangqiao soybeans, 350 bags of Duchang soybeans, 300 bags of Jifangchi soybeans, and over 1,000 bags of Sanyang mixed with green soybeans.</p>

Except for the relatively stable Sutong Japonica rice, Nangang early rice fell by one cent, and mid-grade thin rice also decreased by one to three cents. Only high-quality rice was spared. Over 1,000 shi of new Japonica rice arrived in the unified market, but the sales channels were not wide, resulting in a sharp drop of three cents. The price of Duyang pointed rice followed the Japonica rice market, also softening by about one cent. The sky was overcast and the price was mediocre. (North Shanghai) Arrivals from ships numbered 24-25. The sales channels for various goods were normal at the opening in the morning, and prices were sluggish. Later, due to the active spot transactions, various stores actively replenished their stocks, and the sales channels for various goods became active. Japonica rice remained strong. Thin rice arrivals were few and sales were active, stabilizing prices. Yangjian fixed its price, tightly coupled with the pier by three to four cents. Prices were stable at 100 yuan. Shipments of Dongxin Japonica rice were vigorous, and retail sales were flat, with prices returning a small triangle. The remaining goods were unchanged.</p>
<p>▲ Long River Native Indicia Rice Harvests Hopeful There were slight arrivals of Long River rice yesterday. It is rumored that early rice harvests in Jiangxi and Hunan are hopeful, and local prices in Hexia have returned to the flat level, causing a slowdown in imports. There were only a few sporadic early rice purchases in the interior. Sales from the Fujian group stalled, and the market immediately became weak. However, the Ningbo group had a very strong appetite for brown rice, completing approximately 5,000 bags. The Agricultural Bank and the Marketing Bureau also purchased 6,000 to 7,000 bags of high-quality early rice. Prices were able to hold. Sales for the entire day included 5,150 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,330 bags of Hunan rice, and 4,000 bags of Shahan brown rice.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Silk Firms Set Strict Price Limits Recently, the silk market, limited by the current situation, has shown a withered image both at home and abroad. Silk transactions in Shanghai have become increasingly quiet. Foreign firms, due to the weak silk prices in America and France, have set strict price limits. The number of users has further declined. Market prices are generally weak, but largely trending downward. Yesterday, only Indian firms purchased 9 dan of Sichuan silk, and users started operating with 5 dan.

The Guild marked the market, and spot prices for coarse and fine sand white sugar remained at 14.4 yuan. Re-exported goods rebounded by two cents due to activity in Changsha, currently at 9 yuan, with continued transactions. Other wood cotton white sugar and grade goods were largely unchanged, as traders had stock on hand, resulting in few offerings.</p>
<p>▲ Longkou Vermicelli Rises by Three to Four Yuan Yesterday, spot supplies from the production area were reported to be scarce, and local demand was high, resulting in a rise of three to four yuan. Therefore, market sentiment tightened, and yesterday's price was 36 yuan, up 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Bitter Almonds Offered in Batches Yesterday's price was 21 yuan, and the price increase has already reached 2 yuan. If there is no continued source of supply, the price is expected to continue to tighten.</p>
<p>▲ Prices for White Lead Pigment Increase Significantly Overseas prices were set at 36 pounds per ton, a significant increase of over 4 pounds compared to before.

<h3>The Substance of Grandiose Words</h3>
<p>— Wu Cun</p>
<p>The current situation is depressing. When I look at the newspaper, I often see some colorful and grandiose words that make me dizzy.</p>
<p>Of course, advocating resistance is consistent. In the past few times when "national crises were serious," they still vaguely said that peace had not reached the point of despair, and sacrifices had not reached the final juncture. They advised the people to learn from Yue Wang Goujian, endure hardship and humiliation, and spend ten years to recuperate and ten years to educate. Dr. Hu Shi even told everyone to quietly wait fifty years. But this time, even Beiping and Tianjin, the "cities of culture," have fallen. Are we going to continue to "endure" and "humiliate" in the same old way until forty-five or forty-six years later before resisting?</p>
<p>This is really not going to work. Because although ordinary people do not understand military strategy, they know the urgency of the current national situation. If we do not resist, we will perish.</p>
<p>In response to this popular sentiment, there are many grandiose words. Of course, to resist the enemy, we must be "grand and passionate," but many arguments that are "too grand" often achieve the opposite result. If we carefully analyze them, we will find that the foundation is actually a disguised lament.</p>
<p>For example, the day before yesterday, the Japanese ambassador went down to Vietnam, and the atmosphere of peace became a little thick again. The newspaper recorded the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' attitude towards negotiations, saying, "Although the current situation is extremely tense, when diplomatic relations between China and Japan still exist, the diplomatic authorities of both countries can discuss matters at any time. However, relations between the two countries have now reached the most sinister period... If the other party can truly make the greatest determination and effort to reverse the crisis, it is not too late. Otherwise, the future of peace is difficult to see a glimmer of dawn." This implies that "the other party" is compromising with us and asking for peace, but we are not agreeing. But the reality is the opposite. "The other party's" "greatest determination and effort" have already been used on military force. It is pitiful to still want peace negotiations to "reverse the crisis."</p>
<p>Speaking of resistance, the grandiose words in the past were, "Wherever the enemy army goes, resistance follows." That meant that after they attacked, we would then resist from behind. Now it is even more heroic, becoming, "Wherever the enemy army goes, scorched earth follows." We want to make every person and every piece of land become "ashes," so that they gain nothing.</p>
<p>This is truly, "When will this sun perish? I will die with you." The sound of gnashing teeth seems audible. Tragic and impassioned, extremely "grief-stricken." However, upon careful thought, it is also chilling. It turns out that China's resistance is so weak that once a war starts, it must turn this "vast, resource-rich, and populous" country into "ashes" without any hope of victory? I am afraid that some timid people who hear such grandiose words will be inspired to think about peace.</p>
<p>However, in reality, it is not like this. There are nations that have been destroyed, but there is no country so miserable.</p>
<p>Calling on everyone to be determined to sacrifice is a kind of grandeur. But is sacrifice not for survival? For the hope of national independence and freedom? While declaring despair for victory, and at the same time calling on everyone to prepare to turn into "ashes," this kind of "sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice" is just a complete lament. It is not a matter of grief, but of bottomless darkness.</p>
<p>At a time when the whole country is united and preparing for resistance, it is necessary to encourage and inspire, but we are not afraid of sacrifice, for the sake of final victory. Those lament-style grandiose words suddenly make people feel short of breath - it's better not to say them.</p>
<h3>A Letter from Japan, August 2nd in Kyoto</h3>
<p>— Shu Mu</p>
<p>I miss news from my homeland very much. Even receiving a postcard makes me extremely happy. Today, besides reading the extra edition, while feeling annoyed, I opened the box containing letters and took out a few old letters. I read them carefully one by one, only they can relieve much of my loneliness and longing. Occasionally, I found a letter:</p>
<p>——...The days of resistance are coming soon, you must prepare to return home.</p>
<p>That was sent from Taiyuan the year before last.</p>
<p>There was also a letter in Esperanto, from a worker at a canning factory in France, which was written enthusiastically.</p>
<p>——Roar, you Chinese, why don't you return home to participate in the work? You, comrade, it is better to live in the country than abroad! Comrade, we have many steel-like comrades here who are looking forward to the realization of the resistance. Overthrowing Japanese imperialism should start with us, and it can also be said that it should start with the people all over the world who stand on the peace front.</p>
<p>——Listen, we are already preparing, we are preparing to serve China! We serve China, and we serve peace! Comrade, work hard, we can often hear your kind call here! That is the happiest thing. ...</p>
<p>I read it from beginning to end in one breath, and my heart gradually became active, as if I heard gunshots and artillery fire. ... Just as I was writing this, another extra edition arrived. The clanging bell pierced my nerves. I quickly put down my pen and ran down the stairs, putting on my shoes.</p>
<p>An extra edition was stuffed into the mailbox. Oh, the paper wrote the shocking words of the fall of Tianjin and Beiping.</p>
<p>I don't believe it, I don't believe it: How can China retreat?</p>
<p>Just as I was organizing my books, two inspectors came. They asked fiercely:</p>
<p>"Are you planning to return home?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because of summer vacation."</p>
<p>"Will you come again?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will."</p>
<p>He wrote down what I said in a small notebook, and then began to search through my books. When I saw their hands, my heart moved so intensely. At that time, I only had one hope:</p>
<p>——Don't let them find my manuscripts:</p>
<p>They flipped through it, flipping through it haphazardly.</p>
<p>After more than half an hour, they took away three of my Esperanto books. When they left, the clock on the table was already pointing to eight o'clock.</p>
<p>Tonight, I may have a nightmare.</p>
<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>Reaching out to the darkness, pleading for some mercy, is unfortunate, sad, and also futile. Happiness gives people a smile and then contemplation, contemplation and then oblivion, a little bit of slight fluctuation, a wisp of rosy cloud, some fleeting traces. And when lost in that kind of misfortune and sorrow, one will add some thoughts to the even breathing, and then feel forlorn from the thoughts, and even the smiles are bleak. Thus, a kind of mental silence creeps full of the sharpest points and corners.</p>
<p>In order to pursue some happiness and mercy, creatures of the highest order extend two hands into the darkness. They have desires, they are partial to gains and losses in space, and to ups and downs in time. But those obliterated happinesses will only make a fleeting trace in time, but in the heart, there always remains a kind of tacit understanding, truly gains and losses in space, and ups and downs in time.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard the wailing of a fetus from the neighbor next door? Perhaps that is unusual and wins the joyful faces of the family, like a sigh? And I have unfortunately participated in the funerals of many people, mourned at many corpse fields, people who are buried in the dissection room all day long, with their heads bowed over piles of corpses.</p>
<p>It is said that a person dies, death is the evidence of life, and the dead are unfolding another way of life. In time and space, it is precisely ups and downs, gains and losses. The traces of life become faint, faint and then disappear, but a kind of tacit understanding stays for a long time, living beautifully and freshly.</p>
<p>Therefore, reaching out to the darkness, pleading for some mercy is unfortunate, sad, and also futile. Those azure colors of the hills are symbols of life. And the coffin in the grave, the body in the coffin, decomposed and mixed together, becomes manure, becomes dust flying, stopping and finally disappearing, just like a booming life disappearing on the bed of death.</p>
<p>I have seen corpses on the corpse field being carried out one by one, some managers quietly and busily washing away the purple-black blood stains, already congealed, and still congealing. Although it is dark and thick purple-black, but when a bucket of water is poured down, the color becomes faint, the blood plasma disperses and splits apart, and then swept away with a broom, what will you imagine? The barbaric stench of blood, the gloomy and undispersed souls of the dead, a ghost, a ghost covered in blood. … They have already indifferently spread out a reed mat to enjoy the cool or are laughing at a hearty dinner around the dining table.</p>
<p>Have you ever taken some time out of your busy schedule to visit the dissection room? If you are afraid of those severed heads, those severed arms, and those skulls without skin or muscles, have you not also been to slaughterhouses and vegetable markets? These daily foods are a good analogy to the remains of those living people who are fulfilling their practical uses.</p>
<p>I have personally handled complete and fresh corpses. Those who ended their lives with a noose from the court, died and had no family members to claim them, were once noble virgins. All day long, I hold a certain bone on the human body, reciting it with endless Latin nouns, there are more than two thousand nouns for the bones on a brain, I feel dizzy.</p>
<p>A stubborn person who refuses to die and refuses to submit to death, must die when sentenced to hanging, and must also be subjected to the same treatment under the knife. Only precisely because death is the evidence of life, therefore, tacitly acknowledging the fact that a person has died, is to let him hide the corpse pit under his body, soak in preservatives, and that active heart like a second hand freezes, which is extremely contradictory to the growing soul.</p>
<p>But the remains of the living are ultimately not to be feared. Only sometimes, when despairing of kindness and happiness, adding some thoughts to the even breathing, and then feeling forlorn from the thoughts, smiling bleakly, and then a kind of mental silence creeps full of the sharpest points and corners.</p>
<p>The heart is in a kind of inexplicable depression, leaning on the railing, and again sees that woman holding a bulging belly passing by. There is a kind of tacit understanding that has gains and losses in space and ups and downs in time.</p>

<h3>Increase in the Number of British Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Expansion of Highway Construction Land</p>
<p>The British mainland is small and densely populated. Road traffic has always been very crowded. In recent years, due to the development of the automobile industry and the rapid expansion of roads, the number of people using automobiles has increased day by day. Some people say, "We are going to abolish walking." This is an exaggerated adjective. In addition to bicycles, which have more than doubled compared to the past, there are now almost fourteen cars per mile in Britain. The number of new cars joining the road every year is around 450,000. Of course, many are used to replace old ones, but the total increase in new cars per year is not small. Therefore, in the next three to five years, the number of automobiles will develop to what extent, it is truly difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>At present, the number of automobiles in the UK is approximately 2,650,000. Among them, 1,800,000 are private cars, and 460,000 are motorcycles. In this quarter alone, 334,000 new cars, 85,000 commercial vehicles, and 9,200 buses have been registered. We can see the progress of automobile use in Britain in the past fifteen years from the following table.</p>
<p>According to the above table, it is estimated that the number of new cars joining the road service every day is about 1,200. Regarding motorcycles, the overall trend seems to be declining. Presumably, these people either returned to old bicycles or purchased low-priced cars. The reason for the increase in buses is mostly due to the reduction of trams. However, in cities like London and others, the number of buses has rarely declined, while the body and passenger capacity have increased.</p>
<p>Although the area of ​​Britain seems small, its transportation network is very complete. The country now has 180,000 miles of highways. Compared to the mileage of roads in various countries, these 180,000 miles of highways are considered the largest. However, many people feel that some roads lack perfect construction, often only having a road shape but no road base. Some road surfaces are also too unrefined, making it difficult for heavy-duty vehicles to pass. According to experience, the road surface material must be durable and non-slip. Only in this way can the lifespan of the road be extended. This is especially important for roads with heavy traffic. This year, the Ministry of Transport has made efforts to improve various trunk roads. The mileage is close to 4,500. For example, the width of the road, the dual lanes for vehicle traffic, etc., all have certain standards. The ministry does not wait for all the surveying and mapping to be completed and has already started work. All road fences, road lights, etc. are being improved. As for future expansion, according to the current situation, it will definitely increase without end. Because the need for roads increases day by day, the future progress will be even faster than it is now.</p>
<p>The passenger capacity of buses has increased compared to two or three years ago. Compared to 1931, each bus has increased by three passengers. The business of manufacturers that produce buses is better than that of passenger cars or bicycles. There are now more bicycle users than in the past. There are probably two reasons for this: one is that the public likes to exercise in the outdoor air, and the other is that suburban construction has increased, and many people have moved to live in farther places. The need for bicycles for transportation has of course increased relatively.</p>
<h3>Automobile Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>▲A glimpse of the sales of various brands of automobiles: The retail delivery of Buick in the domestic market in March of this year has reached 20,951 vehicles. The number for the same period in 1936 was 15,107 vehicles. Therefore, this year's sales are indeed greater than in previous years. The sales of Nash cars in March were 10,000 vehicles. The sales of Dodge used cars, including passenger cars and commercial vehicles, increased by 58.1% in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.</p>
