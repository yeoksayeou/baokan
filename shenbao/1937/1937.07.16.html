<h3>冀察政會各首要昨集津商洽外交問題</h3>
<p>宋指派張自忠等與日方代表磋商　和平局勢似已形成其他續待交涉　香月昨訪宋哲元提解决時局條件　日兩師團大軍現暫止於秦榆一帶</p>

<p>［天津］二十日前，日軍大部隊可不致開來、正在輸送之第五•第十•師團、卽止於秦榆錦綏等地待機、由十四日迄二十日七日內、雙方軍隊可望無劇烈衝突、大局是否好轉、亦視此期內雙方談洽程度與事實加何表現為斷、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>［天津］新任華北日駐屯軍總司令香月中將、今日訪問宋哲元、提出解决華北危機之條件、其內容未經宣露、但衆信其條件尚有討論之餘地、（中央社十五日路透電）</p>
<p>［天津］此間大局關鍵、繫於宋哲元與香月之會見、當局十五日召冀察首要來津、集議如何方式始為合宜、聞有採張自忠•陳覺生•齊燮元•先行接洽之途、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］平消息沉寂、空氣煩悶、雖有西南及東南城角偶聞機步槍聲、但官方否認前方有接觸、多指為係步哨小衝突、日兵續增不已、十五日晨由榆先後開來三列、均已到津、卽分別轉往豐台、豐台已成為日軍之大本營、人民遷避、秩序紛亂、平市城內戒備如常、各衝要街道障礙物尚未撤盡、入夜由廿九軍士兵步哨警戒、各城門仍開半扇、廣安•永定•等外城各門、則每一二小時開啟一次、東車站交通完全恢復、西車站平漢通車尚無確期、十五日晨八時、張允榮•過之瀚•門致中•劉郁芬•石敬亭•魏宗瀚•等、連翩赴津、十時曹汝霖亦去、一般相信、時局重心已移天津、（十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>［天津］中日當局雖尚在磋商和平之中、但因日方軍運紛繁之故、形勢猶極度緊張、日當局在天津東車站之監視、今日益行嚴緊、入口處均有日軍駐守、時向行人盤問、卽外人亦不能免、日本僑民在車站歡迎來津之日軍者極為擁擠、今日有日軍四百名携帶大量軍需品開到、不久卽有日軍一隊及鐵甲車三輛、保護滿載軍用品及軍糧之運輸車三十六輛、由公路向豐臺出發、據中國方面消息、日兵車自山海關開來者已有七列、日大使川越猶力稱最近事變、完全在軍事方面、僅限於事變之責任問題及防止同樣事件復發之方法、其他事項並未加以討論云、（中央社十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>和議係日緩兵之計</h3>
<p>［北平］昨晨三時半起之停戰狀態、在識者視之、認為暫時性質、今其言果信、蓋中日軍隊、昨夜在平津路綫上距津西北約三十一哩之落垡車站、又起衝突矣、此次戰事始於昨夜九時、其時有日兵七百、由津乘火車赴豐台、迨抵落垡時、忽與華兵衝突、據路局消息、夜半戰事、猶在進行中、同時豐台日軍刻向南苑集中、據可恃消息、日軍將以驅逐南苑華軍一萬二千人為其作戰方略中之第一目的、昨日停戰十八小時、雖當地緊張空氣、稍見和緩、且冀察政委會人員與日軍當局已在津復開談判、然中外觀察家、咸信此必為日方緩兵之計、蓋料日軍當局現不過等待時機、一俟生力軍齊集後、卽將開始將第二十九軍逐出河北境外也、（中央社十五日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北戰事中的外交路綫</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>華北戰事爆發以來。已將旬日。幸賴我國當局的應付得宜。與二十九軍的</p>
<p>英勇抵抗。已使對方受到相當的損失。最近日本一方面發布全國動員命令。調遣大軍入關。準備作大規模的進攻。一方面則仍表示不欲擴大事件。而希和平解决。這種雙管齊下的手段。看起來似甚矛盾。而實際上則為日本侵略我國慣用的手段。過去的種種事實。早已給我們許多寶貴的敎訓。現在除了發動全國所有的力量。準備抗戰以外。實再沒有第二條保衛華北的妥善辦法。</p>
<p>在華北戰事醞釀開展時。我們除了發動全國的軍力物力人力去應付外。對於外交方面。也應做些動員的工作。因為現在的中國。早已是世界的中國。而遠東事件。也早已成為國際舞台上的重要節目。觀於日本進攻蘆溝橋後。英國卽邀請美國會商及各國輿論立起嚴重反響。就可明顯的看出。假如我們的外交手段。能夠利用得當。則於抗戰的前途。必有極有利的影響。不過這裏要聲明的。抗戰前途勝利的主要因素。是我們四萬萬五千萬的同胞。都有浴血戰塲的决心。而國際的同情或聲援。祇是一種副因素。要是像以前一樣的把整個的國家命運。交給他人。則其錯誤實與那些主張孤立更生的人。有同樣的嚴重。</p>
<p>在目前的環境中。我們所應採行或可採行的外交步驟。有以下的幾種。</p>
<p>第一•我國政府應該向外聲明堅决的立塲。表明我國絕不再容許外力侵佔我尺土寸地。否則祇有以全國力量來保障領土的完整。如果遠東和平因此破壞。則應由侵略者負責。這於日前外部的發言人的聲明中。已有表明。不過還覺到不夠堅决。</p>
<p>第二•我们可依照國聯盟约。將華北戰事提交國聯祕書處•請求召集國聯理事會。或大會討論。日本現在雖已退出國聯。但依盟約第十七條的規定。會員國與非會員國間的爭議或戰事。也可適用盟約的規定。不過關於這點有許多人因鑒於過去的經騐。或不甚贊成。但我們所以主張將此事申訴國聯。並不是想藉國聯的力量來制止日本帝國主義的侵略。我們的用意。是想借國聯的舞台来做我們宣布侵略者暴行的廣播電台。同時國聯在接受中國申訴後。雖在實際行動上不能對我們有所帮助。但總可得道義上的制裁。</p>
<p>第三•根據上述同樣的理由。我們也可向九國公約簽字國。提出日本侵略的事實。因為該約含有保障中國領土完整的條款。九國公約雖沒有規定實際制裁的辦法。同時從九一八以後已被日本扯得粉碎。但到現在還沒有一國表示它業已失效。（如日前美國國務卿赫爾郎有此聲明。）我們自不妨以此來促請各國的注意。擴大我們對外的宣傳。</p>
<p>第四。我們要更加緊民主國家的聯合。自從我國則政部長孔祥熙歷訪英美法三大民主國家後。中國在國際間。已有很大的增進。同時蘇聯雖為日本的死敵。但蘇俄自清黨以後。日本早已試騐過他們的力量與勇氣。知其沒有與日開戰的决心。日本此次敢於動员人犯。卽以此故。我們應該喚起他們的迷夢。不要將來步我們的後塵。</p>
<p>上面所說的。都是華北戰事醞釀擴展時我們所應採行。或可採行的外交步驟。這種外交步驟的施行。主要的目的是在於擴大我們對外的宣傳。引起國際的同情。至於抗戰前途勝利的保證。則還在於我們發動全國的力量。到前綫去抵抗敵人的進攻。如果過信國際同情或蔑視國際形勢。都是於抗戰前途有妨碍的。</p>

<h3>蘇土親善世界和平要素</h3>
<p>歡迎士要人宴席上　李維諾夫發表演說</p>
<p>［莫斯科］昨日加里寗莫洛托夫分別接見土國外長亞拉士•及內長蘇克魯卡亞、均由李維諾夫作陪、晚間克姆林宮舉行盛大招待會、（十五日塔斯電）</p>
<p>李維諾夫演辭</p>
<p>［莫斯科］李維諾夫本日邀講土耳其外長亞拉士•內長蘇克魯卡亞午宴、席間李亞兩人會發表演說、李氏首致歡迎辭云、“二君此次來聘、並無任何直接的原因或目的、此點尤使吾人加以重視、以吾人觀之、此次聘問純為土國重視蘇土親善的表現、並為日前土國總理伊奈奴君在國會中所作宣言的實說、伊君曾云、“蘇土親善將為兩國政策中之穩定的因素、”“在國際關係中、邦交有各種不同的形式、大戰以前、每有二三並不敦睦或甚至對立的國家、乃因一時的需要締結同盟、高談親善、以圖掠奪指定的對象、達到共同的侵略目的、大戰以後、吾人又見其他事實、例如兩個顯然互相犯忌、其外交政策目的亦絕對相反的國家、忽而約定、除高談親善外、其他一概不提、以圖威嚇他人、此種虛偽的親善、當然祇能恐嚇政治上笨拙無知的人物、此外尚有一種國家、平素每用根據某種歷史的權利、或同種的關係而發明的修正主義“神聖”原則為藉口、威脅隣邦的領土完整及主權獨立、然因其軍事準備尚不充分、或國際形勢不利、乃暫時延緩實行威脅、一變而對鄰國宣稱願意在此時維持親善、顯於此點最可異者、乃該隣邦雖深知此種手段將使敵人得機加强武力、從而使其頂定的侵略計劃更可完滿實行、然仍居然接受其顯明的欺騙、</p>
<p>“此外尚有一種雙方力量大不相等的親善、其中較弱之一國為取得保護者”的友誼起見、竟一部份地犧牲自己的獨立地位、此種親善的意意、乃屬非黨相對的自無疑問、</p>
<p>“土耳其與蘇聯十六年來的邦交、與上述各種形式的親善毫無類似之處、土蘇交誼的基礎目的與此完全不同、當不必全贅述”、</p>
<p>李氏繼細論蘇土親善的歷史的根株稱、“因蘇土敦睦之故、各重要的地域如黑海沿岸及兩國所在地局勢均安定平靜、因此、蘇土親善乃為世界和平體系中最重要因素之一、余確信和平之友、必理解而重視蘇土親善的意義、而唯有少數外交政策與國際的和平•安定•信任等原則相反的國家、方能企圖加以破壞、彼等過去反現在均曾進行此種企圖、雖土國最高領袖曾斷然告知彼等、此種企圖注定必歸完全失敗、余今可代整蘇聯政府重行警告彼等、此種破壞歐洲和平集團及和平主幹各國的手段、决無力量損害蘇土然可破壞的交誼“蘇聯根據集體安全及和平不可分割原則所進行的鞏固世界和平初步工作、土國•一律參加、此點余深感愉快、同時蘇土親善尤有一特點、即兩國有各親其本身利益與第三國交往的自由、但因此項交誼的原動力、乃保障世界和平的共同積極意志、則雙方當然將一致避免任何足以援助侵略破壞勢力、加强彼等或足損害和平潛力中任一因素的行動、同時雙方將永在同一原則指導之下、即其友邦之敵和平之敵、亦决不能成為己邦之友、不過即使雙方之一有違背此原則處、其友邦當亦僅以友誼的方式為之指出、而不使友誼因此受損、</p>
<p>“吾人今估計蘇土政治上的關係、同時亦應指出政治友誼對於經濟的及文化的關係之好影響、此次土國諸友來蘇無疑將使此種關係更加發展改進、從而更使全世界深知蘇土交誼之不變性、並使其回憶作為此項交誼之基礎的各原則、因而使和平事業深蒙其利”（十四日塔斯電</p>
<p>土國外長答辭</p>
<p>［莫斯科］土外長亞拉士答辭云、土蘇親善將永為兩國政策之固定的因素、與吾人的邦交有一特點、即兩國在國際舞台爭取應得地位時永遠合作、此點與雙方均屬相宜、同時並不妨害任一方面為其本身利害與特殊形勢而與第三國發生關係的完全自由、吾等的相互務完全公開、並不包含軍事協定或任何特別條約、當然吾人對於對方的命運、仍必相互隨時注意、在此種條件下、兩國的交誼自可稱為“特殊交誼”也、土蘇親善不但在兩國邦交上為永久可貴的因素、即在兩國所在一切地域、尤其黑海沿岸亦然、由此吾人的交誼乃成為和平不可分割與集體安全體系中重要因素之吾人此次來聘、當使雙方政治上經濟上乃至文化上的相互關係更加增進、同時並使世界週知吾人交誼的力量、此交誼無論何物不能動搖、將永遠為和平服務、（十四日塔斯電）</p>

<p>格羅莫夫語人、“法國飛行家嘗欲自巴黎飛至桑狄哥、余等已由莫斯科飛抵此間詔示之矣、”據悉、蘇俄飛行家此次共創立兩種不着地飛行紀錄、一為直綫飛行記錄、一為曲折飛行記錄云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>飛行途中遭遇旋風</p>
<p>［舊金山］蘇聯飛行家格羅摩夫、飛抵加利福尼亞州聖傑辛多城附近降落之後、頃向哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話稱、“余所駕飛機、在飛過洛杉磯天空時、曾昇至五千四百八十公尺之高度、其時因空氣稀薄、不得不使用所備之氧氣、又自魯杜爾夫島至北極之一段航空程中、天氣酷寒、機翼開始結冰、惟吾人備有特種器械、故能將冰除去、繼續飛行、至機內引擎使用情形、至為完美、倘最初飛行時、天氣較為良好、則吾原可飛至墨西哥、惟不幸中途數次遭遇旋風、致不得不繞道而行、當飛近聖傑辛多城時、發現汽油卽將告罄、余殊為驚異、但仍自信必能安全、完成此次飛行、而不遭受任何意外也”云、（按聖傑辛多城係在桑狄哥城北面一百二十公里處、桑狄哥城則與墨西哥邊境相隣近）、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［莫斯科］航空人士以為俄美兩國間定期航空之開辦、今已不成問題、查格羅摩夫所駕飛機為An　　25號、乃係五年前之式樣、至於蘇聯最新式之飛機、其續航力可達二萬五千公里、此外氣象學家則謂、格羅摩夫此次成功、實有賴於無綫電台（卽蘇聯探險家最近在北冰洋所建立者）指導方向、蓋在北極區內、磁石羅盤針失其效用故也、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>立刻發動禦侮抗日戰爭</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>盧溝橋事件的發生，有人說是對方想泡製豐台事件的故技，以便加強共對華北的控制：有人說是對方要乘機造就一個旣成事實，作為外交上討價還價的地步：又有人則說是封方因見國內經濟危機日迫，想藉此以轉移人民的視綫，這些觀察大都是不錯的。但以我個人的目光看來，這事件的發生，最大的原因，恐是在於對方已認淸禦侮抗日，已成為我國舉國一致的救國主張，他們要再進行侵略，除非施用武力壓迫，已沒法使中國屈服，故一班野心的少壯派，不得不貿然重來一次冒險。</p>
<p>明白了這一點，那末盧溝橋事件的發展，便不難預先推斷。在這里我可以毫沒遲疑的說，這事件沒有發生則已，旣經發生，對方一定是會一幹幹到底的。依幾日來的形勢觀察，事件顯然已日相惡化，華北方面的軍事行動不消說，情形已達於最危險關頭。便是他們的國內，空氣也顯得十分的緊張，大批軍隊，登艦待發，海陸軍省的忙碌，宛如戰時狀態。這些情形，自然是一種威脅作用，但是足以看出對方的决心。東京日日新聞，對此事件發表如下的意見：“吾儕所希冀者，乘此機會，對盧溝橋事件北後所潛藏之根本原因，須採取㧞本塞源之對策。此卽國府抗日政策及華北中央化是也。”這便是最好的說明。</p>
<p>以此看來，今後盧溝橋事件的發展，除非是我國再屈服，對方是决不願輕易罷休的。因為他們這次的軍事行動，目的不只在侵略一二土塊，便能滿足，大有非達到壓迫我國取消抗日禦侮主張不止之勢。故這一事件，最近定必有愈形擴大的危險。因為禦侮抗日，是我國上下一致的救國主張。這種主張，是對方侵略政策的一大阻礙，時時有引起衝突的可能。近衛首相便認為這次事件，是中國抗日運動的結果，這自然是一種倒果為因的說法，但也足以看出他們痛恨抗日的一斑。</p>
<p>事已至此，我國唯一的對葉，是立刻發動禦侮抗日戰爭，否則只有坐待敵人的宰割而已，今後國人休想再談抗日救國。</p>
<h3>怎樣移動一個劇團到農村去</h3>
<p>— 克予</p>
<p>在目下中國的鄕村裏，農民大衆是過着極勞苦極悲慘的非人生活，他們需要鼓勵與慰籍，是無容疑義的事。每次村荘上作着簡陋戲劇的演出時，就會轟動全鄕，甚至有老遠的觀衆前來觀劇，這已足以說明農民對於戲劇是如何地飢渴着了。如果我們演劇的內容合於他們共同的需要，卽是與他們生活有關聯；在形式上能做到通俗易懂的話，那麼，我們劇團的受衆歡迎是可以保證的。</p>
<p>並且，在農村裏是孕育着更大的抗x勢力，這種勢力是需要像戲劇一類的文化工作去增大與發揚的，所以我們移動一個劇團到農村去，卽是做了蔣委員長所言的最有效的救國工作。</p>
<p>然則我們怎樣準備去從事移動呢？</p>
<p>第一，我們必須做一次自檢的工作，如：我的身體是否強健？能否吃苦？我的特長的技能是什麼？我的言語，農民可以懂得嗎？……第二，必須考量需要怎麼樣的劇本？我們到農村演劇，首先應該顧到這個劇的內容是否與農民的生活接近，接近了，那他們就易了解，接受，並且熱忱的歡迎。至於劇本的通俗化興結構的簡單明晰，也是兩個重要的條件。第三，必須有嚴密的組織，在組織中指示派定每一部門的明確工作，外如歌詠團與通訊員亦應附設在組織中，便利我們任務的進行。第四，必須作幾次準備的練習演出，每次演完後，就召集團中人員開座談會來檢討，改進。</p>
<p>在推進中，我們尚需注意，在劇本的演出方面：</p>
<p>㊀利用特殊環境當移動劇團走到某一鄕村時，應當觀察一下當地的情形，隨時更變演出的方法，譬如晚上，那也可用一些火把夠了，在農塲上或村街上，甚至可不用劇本，像活報，時事報告，街頭劇或手勢啞劇等都是，總之，只消是具着救亡意義或教育意義就行。</p>
<p>㊁採用舊劇手法我們到鄕村演劇，必須注意到那些在鄕村中有千百年歷史的“土戲”“舊劇”甚或木頭人戲和淸唱等，這些戲我們儘可在改變或揚棄壞的部分保存好的部分後，共同聯合公演；同時“舊劇”的象征手法，在物質條件困乏的情形下，也應該充分採用，這採用舊劇一部分的形式及其演出方法，而灌入新內容的方法，實是話劇深入農村</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>過渡期的必要方法。</p>
<p>在農民心理農村環境的投合方面——㊀團員生活和農民一樣。團員的服裝要樸素，團員的男女間要維持尊嚴，並且也敬重老年人，否則會引起農民的反感。㊁不妨碍及他們的工作。劇團下鄉當然要顧到農民的工作時間，我們不應在農忙的時期內去擾亂他們。同時他們的農作物以及農具等，我們更應格外注意。</p>
<p>下鄉時，我們兼可輔行宣傳國貨，分發通俗刋物，幫助成立當地的合唱隊等等的工作。</p>
<h3>予打擊者以打擊</h3>
<p>— 力幹作</p>
<h3>七月的行列</h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>朋友：</p>
<p>這是去年的事了！</p>
<p>七月的風帶着沉悶，愁鬱的氣味，慘然地吹着。我們這數千人的行列，充滿了熱烈，緊張的情緒，從×界經過，行列的四週，都是××的佈防，他們：槍出了壳，手裏執着木棍子，在向我們獰笑！他們不時向街旁的商店裏的店夥命令着說：“喂！豬玀，把旗子收下來！”於是靑天白日滿地紅的國旗，被小學徒們降了下來。哼！這是個什麼世界呢？不准掛旗！於是整個的行列，騷動起來了，我們像發狂一般地高呼口號來了，××們把木棍子舉得老高地說：“喂！豬玀們，別呌！”朋友！你想，這是怎麼的一會事？有幾個同學搶過去，想揍他幾下，××卽忙把槍揑在手裏，而部顯着是冷笑，意思是在說：“來吧！槍會要你死！”於是那搶上去的幾個，就這麼地退了下來。有幾個搶在行列前，將在地面寫標語，有幾個就被有刺的皮鞋踏了手指，有幾個給一脚踢翻了，回頭來，××揑着槍在笑！</p>
<p>朋友！我們在無可奈何之下轉到學校去，想趁這散學的時候，邀幾多的可愛的同學們，共同來作一次救亡的怒號。</p>
<p>我們的行列，將近××門口時，整十上百的××站兵在我們面前了，他們說：“退回去！”朋友！你想，這是什麼話？於是我們光火了，經不起這個行列中的一個極小的細胞的一聲“衝”時，我們的隊伍，早像潮水般的擁了上去！</p>
<p>朋友！你沒有看見那慘酷的狀况吧！嘿！十幾個××軍，抓住了一個為首的同學打，他媽的！他們用鞭子！棍子！皮帶的鐵環！還用槍柄啦！那個同學，被打倒在地上了，他慘呌了，××軍還用有刺的皮鞋踏他！朋友！我們都是中國人呀！第二個，照樣的被做了！於是：我們整個的行列衝了上去，我們沒有鞭子，也沒有棍子，皮帶，更沒有槍柄，但我們有的是熱血！我們可以流盡熱血，來喚醒這一班不要臉的漢奸，走狗們！朋友！這時的數十個××軍眞不夠應付我們了，我們正要衝破××的陣綫的時候，××局的兩輛紅色警備車來了！我沒有看見過牠們抓過强盜，也沒有打過敵人，誰也不會想信，第一次的應用，就是打我們這一班手無寸鐵的學生！警備車裏跳出來了上百的××，他們像一羣餓虎，紛向我們一羣綿羊般的行列上撲來！我們雖想抵抗，但綿羊豈有能敵餓虎的道理？我們只有向後退了。這時候，那羣惡虎却發狂了，他們衝向我們來，用傢伙打我們，更喜歡打女同學們，他們打她們的臉。有一個女同學，給五六個惡虎抓住了，用有刺的皮鞋往她屁股上踢！女同學慘然地哭了，他們却滿意地笑了！朋友！你想，這是個什麼世界？我們逃了，說來好麼可恥呀！然而××們還不放鬆我們，他們用摩托車向我們隊伍衝來，鞭子揍我們的頭！脚踢我們的身！朋友！我們雖怒，但，除領受之外，還有什麼話可說呢？</p>
<p>走過紀念塔的時候，我們手握着手，突的，一塊兒回過身來，想作一個最後的衝刺，然而××的武器，又把我們趕了回來！</p>
<p>外來的壓迫的力量更大了，我們只得分散成幾個小隊，向四旁的小弄裏逃，然而還有女同學給抓出來受打！</p>
<p>行列散光了，××們喘息着！倒究打人也費力的。五六個淸道夫，在洗着街上的殷紅的血蹟，還有熱氣啦！這是愛國的熱血！停一會，電車也通行了，一切都依舊一般的進行着，誰又知道，半小時前的這裏，曾作過大屠殺塲的呢？</p>
<p>朋友！</p>
<p>這是去年的事了！快又要週年了！</p>
<p>然而，我們要踏着被難者的血漬，來舉行一個偉大，悲壯的週年祭！</p>
<p>我們的好朋友！</p>

<h3>Key Figures of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council Gathered in Tianjin Yesterday to Discuss Diplomatic Issues</h3>
<p>Song Appointed Zhang Zizhong and Others to Consult with Japanese Representatives; Peaceful Situation Seems to Have Formed; Other Matters Await Negotiation; Xiangyue Visited Song Zheyuan Yesterday, Proposing Conditions for Resolving the Situation; Large Forces from Two Japanese Divisions Have Temporarily Stopped in the Qin-Yu Area</p>
<p>[Tianjin] As of 1:00 AM on the 16th, the peaceful situation has been determined. Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yunrong, Deng Zhexi, and others are scheduled to meet with Hashimoto and Wachi again on the afternoon of the 16th, and everything can be decided. (Urgent telegram, morning of the 16th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 4:00 PM on the 15th, key figures from the 29th Army of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, from Song Zheyuan down to Zhang Zizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Liu Yufen, Guo Zhihan, Zhang Yunrong, Shi Jingting, Wei Zonghan, Chen Juesheng, Deng Zhexi, and others, all arrived at the Jinde Society on 17th Road in the British Concession for a collective discussion on diplomatic issues. Song designated Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yunrong, and Deng Zhexi as the responsible persons to consult with the responsible persons on the other side, Hashimoto and Wachi. They agreed to meet at the Beining official residence on Haihe Road on the evening of the 15th for concrete negotiations. The countermeasures to be taken here have already been decided. Before complete restoration, efforts should first be devoted to preventing further increase in Japanese troops, and those already increased should not engage in military activities. The number of troops near Lugouqiao on the outskirts of Ping should be reduced to gradually calm the military's anxieties, so that mutual trust can be maintained. Matters that should be handled without harming our side will be handled by ourselves. Therefore, as of the evening of the 15th, there is hope for peace. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Before the 20th, most of the Japanese army will not be likely to come. The 5th and 10th Divisions that are being transported will stop in the Qin, Yu, Jin, and Sui areas to await orders. From the 14th to the 20th, for seven days, the troops on both sides can hopefully avoid fierce conflict. Whether the overall situation will improve will also depend on the extent of the negotiations between the two sides during this period and how the facts are manifested. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Garrison in North China, Lieutenant General Xiangyue, visited Song Zheyuan today and proposed conditions for resolving the North China crisis. The content has not been disclosed, but it is generally believed that there is still room for discussion regarding the conditions. (Reuters report from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The key to the situation here lies in the meeting between Song Zheyuan and Xiangyue. The authorities summoned key figures from Hebei and Chahar to Tianjin on the 15th to discuss what approach would be appropriate. It is said that there is a path to adopt Zhang Zizhong, Chen Juesheng, and Qi Xieyuan to make initial contacts. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Beijing] News from Ping is silent, and the atmosphere is oppressive. Although sporadic bursts of machine-gun fire were heard from the southwest and southeast corners of the city, officials deny that there has been contact at the front lines, mostly referring to it as minor conflicts between sentries. Japanese soldiers continue to increase unabated. Three trains arrived from Yu on the morning of the 15th, all of which have arrived in Tianjin and then transferred to Fengtai. Fengtai has become the main base for the Japanese army, and people are moving away, causing disorder. Precautions in the city of Ping are as usual, and obstacles on important streets have not been completely removed. Soldiers from the 29th Army guard the area at night, and the city gates remain half-open. The gates of the outer city, such as Guang'an and Yongding, are opened once every one or two hours. Traffic at the East Railway Station has been completely restored, but there is no definite date for the resumption of traffic on the Pinghan Railway at the West Railway Station. At 8:00 AM on the 15th, Zhang Yunrong, Guo Zhihan, Men Zhizhong, Liu Yufen, Shi Jingting, Wei Zonghan, and others rushed to Tianjin one after another. Cao Rulin also left at 10:00 AM. It is generally believed that the center of the situation has shifted to Tianjin. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Although the Chinese and Japanese authorities are still negotiating for peace, the situation remains extremely tense due to the frequent movement of Japanese troops. The Japanese authorities' surveillance at the East Railway Station in Tianjin has become increasingly strict today. Japanese troops are stationed at the entrance, and they question pedestrians from time to time, even foreigners are not exempt. Japanese expatriates were extremely crowded at the station welcoming the Japanese soldiers arriving in Tianjin. Today, 400 Japanese soldiers arrived with a large amount of military supplies. Soon after, a team of Japanese soldiers and three armored vehicles escorted thirty-six transport vehicles fully loaded with military supplies and provisions, departing along the highway towards Fengtai. According to Chinese sources, seven trains of Japanese soldiers have come from Shanhaiguan. Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe still strongly claims that the recent incident is entirely in the military sphere, limited only to the issue of responsibility for the incident and methods to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, and that other matters have not been discussed.

<p>[Tianjin] Key figures from Hebei and Chahar, Shi Jingting, Guo Zhihan, Men Zhizhong, Zhang Yunrong, Wei Zonghan, and Liu Yufen, came to Tianjin at noon on the 15th for a collective discussion. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At noon on the 15th, Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yunrong, Wei Zonghan, Chen Juesheng, Deng Zhexi, Zhang Shizhao and others went to the Jinde Society to visit Song Zheyuan to discuss the Lugouqiao Incident. The atmosphere of peace here is still very strong, but the resolution of the situation does not seem to be possible within two or three days. Currently, China and Japan are still continuing negotiations on the 15th, but the details of the consultations are kept secret by both sides, so it is impossible to find out what stage it has reached. A certain key figure denied to others on the 15th that any agreement had been signed. It is said that if there were an agreement, then why would there be a need for consultation? Song is waiting in Tianjin for the negotiations to come to an end, and then he will return to Ping. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Li Shijun, representative of the 29th Army stationed in Nanjing, telegraphed Ping to inquire about the negotiation process of the Lugouqiao Incident and whether any conditions from the Japanese side were accepted. Mr. Li received a reply from Qin Dechun and Feng Zhi'an on the morning of the 15th, the contents of which are recorded below. (Omitted) Text (12th) Greetings received on Haishi. Upon investigation, the content of our contact with the Japanese authorities regarding the Lugouqiao Incident was verbal consultation. They falsely accused the incident of being instigated by the Communist Party, demanding a crackdown, and expressing regret for the officers and soldiers who died in action, and hoped that similar incidents would not occur in the future. Our side proposed that the Japanese side should not conduct night exercises in the future. After negotiation, both sides began to withdraw. However, to this day, our side has withdrawn the troops to their original locations, but they have not yet withdrawn. Moreover, fifteen trains have arrived from Tianjin one after another. Today, about 2,000 Japanese infantry and artillerymen came west along the Pingjin Avenue from Tianjin. Moreover, small units of their troops are constantly appearing on the outskirts of Ping. This is the latest situation. The various rumors circulating in Jinghu are not to be believed. Special reply, Qin Dechun, Feng Zhi'an, Koutou, Hanshi, 14th Shencan. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] The Lugouqiao area was silent on the 14th. From a military perspective, the Japanese side seems to be avoiding a direct confrontation and tending towards a side-threatening posture, but peace has not been completely despaired of. It is said that the northern authorities are still seeking peace on the principle of self-defense and survival, and are trying to avoid expanding the situation. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Lugouqiao Incident has been under discussion by both China and Japan in Tianjin for days, but only opinions have been exchanged. Formal negotiations will begin on the 16th. On the 15th, Qi Xieyuan, Chen Juesheng, Zhang Zizhong, and Zhang Yunrong met with Hashimoto and Wachi separately. It is reported that the formal negotiations to be held in Tianjin in the future will continue the various matters previously discussed by both sides in Ping, and the content will not be much different from before. What the Japanese side has proposed is still to insist that our side apologize and punish the perpetrators, but this is a problem for both sides. Because our troops have withdrawn to a considerable distance, we demand that the Japanese side withdraw its troops as soon as possible, but the other side has stated that it will do so after a complete resolution. Therefore, the opinions of the two sides still have a considerable distance. The informal contacts in recent days have also been nothing more than how to bring the opinions of the two sides closer so that formal negotiations can proceed smoothly. General observations here are that although this negotiation cannot be absolutely optimistic, if the Japanese side can be sincere, then a peaceful resolution is also possible. Song Zheyuan intends to go to Ping around the 20th. It is also rumored that the representatives of our side during the formal negotiations will be Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yunrong, and Deng Zhexi. Zhang and others exchanged opinions at Qi Xieyuan's residence on the night of the 15th. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 4:00 PM on the 15th, when Song met with key figures from Hebei and Chahar at the Jinde Society in Tianjin, the key figures asked Song to return to Ping as soon as possible to take charge of all major plans.

<p>[Beijing] More than a hundred Japanese soldiers in six large automobiles and one tank drove from Fengtai through Yuquanying in the southern suburbs to the front of You'anmen this morning. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Peace Talks are a Japanese Delaying Tactic</h3>
<p>[Beijing] The ceasefire that began at 3:30 AM yesterday is viewed by knowledgeable people as temporary. Their words are now confirmed, as Chinese and Japanese troops clashed again last night at Luofa Railway Station, about 31 miles northwest of Tianjin on the Pingjin line. This battle began at 9:00 PM last night, when 700 Japanese soldiers were traveling by train from Tianjin to Fengtai. When they arrived at Luofa, they suddenly clashed with Chinese soldiers. According to railway bureau sources, the battle was still ongoing at midnight. At the same time, Japanese troops in Fengtai are concentrating towards Nanyuan. According to reliable sources, the Japanese army will make the expulsion of 12,000 Chinese troops from Nanyuan the first objective of their operational plan. Although the tense atmosphere eased slightly during the eighteen-hour ceasefire yesterday, and personnel from the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and Japanese military authorities have reopened negotiations in Tianjin, Chinese and foreign observers alike believe that this must be a Japanese delaying tactic. It is expected that the Japanese military authorities are merely waiting for an opportunity, and once fresh troops are assembled, they will begin to expel the 29th Army from Hebei Province.

<h3>A Certain Government Official Refutes Erroneous Theories of the Japanese Army Authorities</h3>
<p>It is Known to the World that the Japanese Army Provoked the Lugouqiao Incident Without Cause; It is the Duty of the Government to Inspire the People's Patriotism; Japanese People have Committed No Less than Hundreds of Illegal Acts in China</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A certain government official recently commented on the observations of the Japanese Army authorities on the National Government's handling of the Lugouqiao Incident, as reported by the Allied News Agency. According to the Allied News Agency's telegram from Tokyo on July 15, the Japanese Army authorities made various comments and criticisms on the attitude of our government in handling the Lugouqiao Incident. The wording is absurd and bizarre, and the arguments are groundless. The speaker may have thought he was doing his best, but readers only see the poor propaganda techniques. The Army authorities first said that the incident was caused by unlawful shooting by Chinese soldiers. The Lugouqiao Incident occurred because the Japanese army illegally conducted exercises in Lugouqiao late at night and attacked our army without cause. It is already a well-known event in the world. The Army authorities then said that the National Government suppressed key figures and popular movements in China who were working with Japan, and aroused the patriotism of the core members of the Hebei-Chahar army and students, using it as a means to unify China by its own strength. Unifying the country and inspiring the people's patriotism are the duties of governments of all countries. Now the Japanese Army authorities are using this as a reason to attack the National Government, which is tantamount to admitting their policy of dividing and ruling China. China advocates working together with its neighbor Japan on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, but to this day, Japan has never regarded us as equal, let alone mutual benefit. As for using the name of cooperation to carry out aggression, the government has no choice but to oppose it. The Japanese Army authorities then said that the National Government used the hands of the Japanese army to eliminate troops other than the direct line of the Central Army, which is even more groundless and divisive, and not worth a laugh from those in the know. The organization and garrison areas of the Chinese army may be different, but they are all national troops, and there is no distinction between systems. If any country militarily invades China, China will not hesitate to use the country's entire military force to deal with it. The Army authorities' ranting cannot deceive the world, let alone the Chinese people. As for what the Army authorities called hundreds of acts of violence against Japan by China in recent times, it must be a reversed and erroneous version of Japan's acts of violence against China. In recent years, the Japanese people have committed no less than hundreds of illegal acts in China, such as smuggling, drug trafficking, gambling, harboring prostitutes, illegally establishing special agencies, and so on. People in the East and West have heard and seen it, and no matter how much they reverse right and wrong, it is difficult to hide the eyes and ears of the world.

<h3>Kawagoe Says Both Sides are Discussing Solutions</h3>
<p>Increasing Troops and Provocations are Considered Local Incidents; Meeting with Song Not Yet Determined; Consular Conference Not Being Held</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kawagoe met with reporters on the morning of the 15th and talked about the Lugouqiao Incident. He said that the Japanese side did not mention other political demands or discuss any secret agreements with local authorities. Kawagoe met with the press at the Tokiwa Hotel on the morning of the 15th, first saying that he originally planned to stay in Tianjin for two or three days, but as of now, the date to go to Ping has not yet been determined. He then said that after arriving in Tianjin, he met with the Japanese military authorities and learned about the Lugouqiao Incident. The first step is how to stop the continued conflict, and the second step is how to avoid the recurrence of the same incident. If the Chinese side's attitude does not change, a direct conflict between China and Japan is not impossible. Kawagoe also said that the Japanese side has no intention of using this incident to negotiate other issues in North China. In short, if this matter is not handled properly, it may lead to a major accident. Kawagoe finally said that it is not yet determined whether he will meet with Song Zheyuan in Tianjin, and there is no intention to hold a North China consular conference in Tianjin.

<h3>Song Declines Donations from All Parties to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Song Zheyuan issued a circular telegram on the 15th, saying that all newspaper offices across the country and compatriots from all walks of life and overseas Chinese are informed that the Lugouqiao Incident unfortunately occurred. Compatriots from all walks of life at home and abroad have sent telegrams of condolences and have donated money to comfort the troops, providing enthusiastic support, which has inspired the entire army. This incident is only a local conflict with few casualties. Moreover, the country raises soldiers for a thousand days to use them for a moment, and it is the duty of soldiers to serve on the battlefield. The army has salaries in peacetime and military expenses in wartime. Zheyuan believes that it is not appropriate to ask for help from compatriots at home and abroad for this kind of small conflict. Although the kindness of all parties is deeply appreciated, the donations will not be accepted. If a major international war occurs in the future, with national mobilization and great sacrifices, the country will make overall plans and compatriots will donate, it will not be too late. I sincerely express my humble intentions and hope for your understanding. Song Zheyuan, Xian, Koutou. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Capital's All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association is Established</h3>
<p>Telegraphing Condolences to the 29th Army and Calling on the Nation to Rise Up</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Capital's All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association held its founding meeting at the City Party Headquarters on the 15th. More than 300 representatives from various departments, ministries, commissions, and bureaus of the Central National Government, as well as party, government, military, police, agencies, organizations, and schools in the Jing City attended. Liu Baimin presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech. Then, Peng Erkang explained the significance of organizing the Anti-Enemy Support Association, and then passed many important proposals. The association also sent a telegram of condolences to the 29th Army in the name of the conference and called on the nation to unite to resist the enemy. The original telegram briefly stated that the enemy has already seized our four northeastern provinces and is invading our North China. Like a greedy pig and a long snake, they are insatiable. Recently, they used the excuse of exercises to invade our Lugouqiao and attack our Wanping. Sima's intentions are obvious. This war is a decisive battle for the entire nation, and its nature is by no means a local conflict. The gain or loss of North China is related to the survival of the entire country. Without the unified guidance of the central government, it is impossible to accomplish the task of resisting insults and saving the country. Without the unanimous support of the national policy of the central government, there is no way to solve the current urgent difficulties. Our officers and soldiers of the 29th Army, who were ordered to defend their territory this time, are loyal, brave, and fighting bloody battles. The good news has spread, and all Chinese people are moved. Our soldiers at the front are generously sacrificing themselves to defend the homeland, and our compatriots in the rear should also fulfill their national duties, contributing their wealth and strength enthusiastically. This association was established on the 15th. We, on behalf of the millions of people in the capital, vow to live under the same sky as the invaders. (Telegram from the Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>Slight Change in Atmosphere in the Tokyo Area</h3>
<p>Local Governors' Conference Held, Foreign and Naval Ministers' Wording Subdued, Kanebo and Other Stocks Rebound</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, the atmosphere here seems to have slightly shifted. The general impression of observers is that the resolution of the Lugouqiao Incident may not be very difficult. However, what the negotiations between Commander of the Garrison Army, Katsuki, and Song Zheyuan involve remains unclear. The instructions from Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Naval Minister Yonai at the local governors' conference seemed subdued. Currently, great importance is attached here to the movement of the Central Army. Kanebo stocks, which have the closest relationship with China, plummeted 30 yuan in the past ten days, but rebounded 7-8 yuan starting yesterday afternoon. Other stocks also rebounded. This morning, various stocks and bonds rebounded across the board. However, the current situation is extremely complex, with many difficulties, and optimism is not warranted. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Army Minister Sugiyama each delivered instructions at the emergency conference of local governors today. All expressed hope for a peaceful resolution of the North China Incident, but all advised the people to prepare for a reversal of the situation and not to be optimistic. Sugiyama said that the Chinese army mistakenly believes that Japanese forbearance is weakness, and the Chinese people misunderstand Japan's position, thinking that they can defeat Japan by gaining the sympathy and intervention of Europe and the United States. Konoe stated, hoping that China would quickly reconsider its attitude and provide assurances that recent reckless behavior will not happen again. Hirota said that it would be fortunate if the ongoing local negotiations could secure sufficient guarantees for maintaining peace and order in North China. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Army Minister Sugiyama and Naval Minister Mitsumasa Yonai declared at the local governors' conference today that they have not completely abandoned hope for a peaceful resolution of the North China Incident, but the people must deeply understand the necessity of concentrating military forces in North China.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Ambassadors Meet with German Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Report on North China Situation</p>
<p>[Berlin] The ambassadors of China and Japan separately visited Foreign Minister Neurath today for discussions. According to political figures, the ambassadors only reported news about the current situation in North China and did not discuss anything else. Japanese sources here generally believe that the news reports exaggerate the importance of the current Sino-Japanese dispute. Semi-official German sources also acknowledge that news reports are sometimes exaggerated and say that the authorities have ordered newspapers to adopt a more reserved attitude toward the Sino-Japanese dispute in the future. Chinese sources in Berlin mostly express pessimism, saying that China is determined to resist to the end. In addition, a newsletter published by the Japanese Residents Association in Berlin contains an article stating that Japan must show its true strength to China in the future in order to correct China's various "erroneous ideas."

<h3>U.S. Congressmen Demand Protest to Japan</h3>

<p>[Washington] Congressmen Bonner, Cowey, Connally, and Hill sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull today, stating that the recent Sino-Japanese conflict in North China has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, and demanding that the Japanese government be protested. For the sake of world peace, this move is necessary. They also cited Major General Mitchell's testimony to the Federal Committee in 1934, calling Japan the most dangerous enemy of the United States.

<h3>London Stock Exchange Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>[London] The stock exchange remains quiet on the Sino-Japanese dispute and has not shown any panic due to recent developments. Major insurance companies and banks holding Sino-Japanese bonds have not sold them, and many have even bought them at the recent price declines, thus stabilizing prices considerably. The current situation is stable but inactive. Londoners generally do not believe that war is inevitable and hope to find a face-saving solution. Although the spokesman for the Nanjing government has made statements about aiding the 29th Army, the general public has therefore bought forward, believing this to be a clear sign of China's increasingly solid unity. The reason why Londoners are optimistic is that they believe that neither China nor Japan can afford a war for economic reasons at present. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>

<p>London: Regarding the North China Incident, The Times today published an editorial stating that Japan's smartest move today would be to "beat a retreat," begin investigating the truth of the July 8th Incident, and, with China's cooperation, make a true assessment of the value of stray bullets. In this way, Japan may win the world's respect and gratitude. Unfortunately, the opportunity for Japan to take this approach is now extremely slim. The reasons are: 1) Lack of trust in dealing with China, because the Chinese are far superior to the Japanese in diplomatic skills; 2) Seeing the gradual soundness of all Chinese politics, feeling uneasy at heart; 3) The unruliness of the Japanese military. If the danger to the future is measured, a large-scale war seems to be expected, unless there is a sudden reversal in the last five minutes. What the Japanese army does not want to do is to quietly withdraw before launching a large-scale attack on Song Zheyuan's troops. The Times does not believe that Japan or China had profound secret intentions beforehand, and believes that the beginning of the incident was a hypersensitive sentry, or an incapable officer, or both. It is also worth noting that the repercussions of small misunderstandings have been allowed to expand to an ominous extent, but neither Nanjing nor Tokyo has fully exploited the potential for disruption inherent in the situation. On the surface, Tokyo seems willing to do its utmost to localize the incident, but this does not mean that a more serious war can be averted, or even, unfortunately, the opposite. But when the Japanese army is taking extreme actions, the Japanese government is shuddering at the danger of the risky future. Japan may be able to take Beiping in one fell swoop, and even sail warships up the Yangtze River to spy on the Chinese capital, but this is only a momentary pleasure. However, from the perspective of a politician, even if the situation becomes more serious than this, no one would dare to choose this dangerous path that will ultimately lead to disaster. In the past year and a half, Japan has hardly understood what it wants in North China and how it can obtain it. But if it is said that Japan will turn North China into a second "Manchukuo," Japan will never be willing to do so, because the result of the victory in North China will only add significant financial and military responsibilities. As it stands, Japan's hands are already full, but its treasury is becoming increasingly empty. Japan can wage war without a declaration, but if it grinds China's sense of self-esteem to an indelible extent, Japan must be careful. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, recently commented on the Far East Incident, expressing concern about Japan's aggressive intentions, praising the Chinese army's loyal and brave resistance, and saying that the Chinese nation is now completing the task of unification. China has been able to establish a more unified front against foreign aggression and resist it. The old trick of "September 18th" can no longer be used. Japan should be aware of this.

<h3>Panjiakou Actually Assigned to the Jurisdiction of Puppet Manchukuo</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] Confirmed news: On the evening of June 20, the puppet Rehe Qinglong County Magistrate suddenly arrived at Panjiakou, Qian'an County, Hebei-East, and immediately took over the Fourth Police Station of Qian'an County, ordering the police to wear Manchukuo uniforms. However, police officer Liu Zhenlou prostrated himself and wept, refusing to wear them, and was placed under guard and sent to Shuangzishan for labor. The remaining police officers were all forced to sign a letter of commitment to obey Manchukuo and were willing to be supervised and directed by the Japanese man Wanshan, serving as usual. At 7:00 AM on the 22nd, the puppet county magistrate, accompanied by the captain of the puppet Manchukuo border police team and the Japanese military police chief, declared in front of the public that the Hebei-East puppet organization had assigned the Panjiakou area of Qian'an County to the jurisdiction of puppet Manchukuo. Afterwards, they patrolled the surrounding areas. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese man Sugiyama went to the Panjiakou Customs Branch and declared that due to military conditions, puppet Manchukuo had obtained the consent of the Hebei-East puppet organization to assign Panjiakou to the management of puppet Manchukuo, and inquired about the attitude towards this matter. According to the Chinese customs authorities, the Panjiakou Customs Branch will not lightly withdraw unless absolutely necessary. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Path in the North China War</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the North China War, nearly ten days have passed. Fortunately, our authorities have handled the situation appropriately, and the heroic resistance of the 29th Army has inflicted considerable losses on the enemy. Recently, Japan has issued a national mobilization order, deploying a large army to enter the customs, preparing for a large-scale offensive. On the other hand, it still expresses that it does not want to expand the incident and hopes for a peaceful resolution. This two-pronged approach seems contradictory, but it is actually a common tactic used by Japan to invade our country. Past facts have already given us many valuable lessons. Now, besides mobilizing all the forces of the nation to prepare for the war of resistance, there is really no other proper way to defend North China.</p>
<p>When the North China War is brewing and developing, in addition to mobilizing the military, material, and human resources of the whole country to deal with it, we should also do some mobilization work in the diplomatic aspect. Because today's China is already the China of the world, and the Far East incident has long become an important program on the international stage. Observing the serious reaction of British invitation of US consultation and opinions of various countries after Japan's attack on Lugouqiao, we can clearly see that if our diplomatic means can be used properly, it will have a very favorable impact on the future of the war of resistance. However, it must be stated here that the main factor for the victory in the future of the war of resistance is that our 450 million compatriots are determined to fight bloody battles, and international sympathy or support is only a secondary factor. If the entire national destiny is handed over to others as before, then the error is as serious as those who advocate isolation.</p>
<p>In the current environment, the diplomatic steps that we should take or can take are as follows:</p>
<p>First, our government should make a firm statement to the outside world, stating that our country will never allow foreign forces to occupy an inch of our territory. Otherwise, we can only use the power of the whole country to protect the integrity of the territory. If peace in the Far East is thus destroyed, the aggressor should be held responsible. This has already been stated in the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a few days ago, but it still feels not firm enough.</p>
<p>Second, we can submit the North China War to the Secretariat of the League of Nations in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations and request the convocation of the Council or Assembly of the League of Nations for discussion. Although Japan has now withdrawn from the League of Nations, according to Article 17 of the Covenant, disputes or wars between member states and non-member states can also be subject to the provisions of the Covenant. However, many people do not quite agree with this point because of past experience. However, the reason why we advocate appealing this matter to the League of Nations is not to use the power of the League of Nations to stop the aggression of Japanese imperialism. Our intention is to use the stage of the League of Nations as a radio station for us to announce the atrocities of the aggressor. At the same time, after the League of Nations accepts China's appeal, although it cannot help us in actual actions, it can always get moral sanctions.</p>
<p>Third, based on the same reasons mentioned above, we can also present the facts of Japanese aggression to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Because the treaty contains clauses to protect the territorial integrity of China. Although the Nine-Power Treaty does not stipulate actual sanction measures, and it has been shattered by Japan since September 18, no country has yet stated that it has become invalid. (As Secretary of State Hull of the United States stated a few days ago.) We may as well use this to urge the attention of various countries and expand our external publicity.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must strengthen the unity of democratic countries. Since our Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi visited the three major democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France, China has greatly increased its international standing. At the same time, although the Soviet Union is a mortal enemy of Japan, since the purges in Soviet Russia, Japan has already tested their strength and courage, and knows that they have no determination to go to war with Japan. Japan dares to mobilize personnel this time for this reason. We should awaken their dreams and not follow in our footsteps in the future.</p>
<p>The above are the diplomatic steps that we should take or can take when the North China War is brewing and expanding. The main purpose of the implementation of these diplomatic steps is to expand our external publicity and arouse international sympathy. As for the guarantee of victory in the future of the war of resistance, it still lies in mobilizing the strength of the whole country to go to the front line to resist the enemy's attack. It is detrimental to the future of the war of resistance to over-believe in international sympathy or to despise the international situation.</p>
<h3>Vice President Kong Leaves the United States for Europe</h3>
<p>May Return Home Early</p>
<p>[New York] Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of our country, along with Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and secretaries Chen Bingzhang, Chen Wenting, and Hu Yi Gu, etc., left the United States for Europe today on the French mail ship "Normandie." Those who came to the dock to see them off included representatives of the US Secretary of State Hull, representatives of the Mayor of New York LaGuardia, and other people from all walks of life and overseas Chinese, totaling about several hundred people. When he was about to leave, Vice President Kong made a statement to reporters, expressing his gratitude for the hospitality he received from all parties in the United States and the results of this trip. Reporters then asked him for his opinion on the actions of the Japanese army in North China. Vice President Kong resolutely replied, "Illegitimate," and asked reporters to read his remarks on Sino-Japanese relations, which he issued yesterday and were published in today's newspapers, and said that there was no need to add anything at this time. Regarding the issue of the Sino-American agreement, Mr. Kong was unwilling to discuss it further, only pointing out that the exchange of gold and silver between China and the United States was implemented due to needs, and its purpose was to benefit both countries. Vice President Kong and his party will first go to London, and then go to France and Germany according to the original plan, but because the situation in North China is becoming increasingly tense, they may cancel their vacation in Bad Nauheim, Germany, and return home early (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi took the "Normandie" mail ship to Europe today. Before leaving, he issued a statement thanking US President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for their cooperation. Since the Sino-Japanese situation is tense, Mr. Kong will return home from Europe soon. The rest of the personnel will take President Hoover from San Francisco on July 24 and return home directly. Only Mr. Li will stay in New York to study the US Federal Reserve System and foreign credit management organizations. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>[New York] The Chinese Consulate General here announced today that the Chinese Ministry of Finance is preparing to exchange the loans of the Pacific Construction Company. Prior to this, Chinese Finance Minister Dr. Kong Xiangxi declared that this matter only requires the consent of the bondholders of both parties before it can be handled. After China recovers the current bond face value of 5.5 million yuan, it will issue new bonds of 4.9 million yuan. The interest rate on the new bonds will be 2% in the first year, and then increase by half a percent each year until it reaches 4%. Starting in 1942, the principal will be repaid at 5% per year, and then the principal will be repaid proportionally every two years. Starting in 1952, the principal will be repaid at 10% per year for three consecutive years, and the debt can be cleared. The new debt is guaranteed by the Chinese salt tax. At present, most of the bonds are held by the American banking community. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Turkish Friendship is a Factor for World Peace</h3>
<p>Li Weinuofu Delivers a Speech at a Banquet Welcoming Turkish Dignitaries</p>
<p>[Moscow] Yesterday, Kalinin and Molotov separately received Turkish Foreign Minister Aras and Interior Minister Sukru Kaya, accompanied by Li Weinuofu. A grand reception was held at the Kremlin in the evening (TASS telegram on the 15th).</p>
<p>Li Weinuofu's Speech</p>
<p>[Moscow] Li Weinuofu invited Turkish Foreign Minister Aras and Interior Minister Sukru Kaya to a luncheon today. Li and Ya delivered speeches during the banquet. Li first delivered a welcome speech, saying, "The fact that the two gentlemen came to visit without any direct reason or purpose makes us pay special attention to it. In our view, this visit is purely a manifestation of Turkey's emphasis on Soviet-Turkish friendship, and it is a true statement of the declaration made by Turkish Prime Minister Inonu in the National Assembly a few days ago. Mr. Yi once said, 'Soviet-Turkish friendship will be a stable factor in the policies of the two countries.' "In international relations, there are various forms of diplomatic relations. Before the war, there were often two or three countries that were not friendly or even opposed to each other, but they formed alliances due to temporary needs and talked about friendship in order to plunder designated targets and achieve common aggressive purposes. After the war, we saw other facts. For example, two countries that were obviously mutually wary and whose foreign policy goals were absolutely opposite suddenly agreed to say nothing other than talking about friendship in order to intimidate others. This kind of hypocritical friendship can of course only scare politically clumsy and ignorant people. In addition, there is also a kind of country that usually uses the "sacred" principle of revisionism invented based on certain historical rights or common relations as an excuse to threaten the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of neighboring countries. However, because their military preparations are not sufficient or the international situation is unfavorable, they temporarily postpone the implementation of the threat and suddenly declare to neighboring countries that they are willing to maintain friendship at this time. The most peculiar thing about this point is that although the neighboring country knows that this method will give the enemy an opportunity to strengthen its military power, so that its established aggression plan can be more fully implemented, it still accepts its obvious deception,</p>
<p>"In addition, there is also a kind of friendship between two parties with great disparities in power. In order to obtain the friendship of the 'protector,' the weaker country partially sacrifices its own independent status. There is no doubt that the meaning of this kind of friendship is non-reciprocal.</p>
<p>"The diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union for the past sixteen years are not similar to the above-mentioned forms of friendship. The foundation, purpose, and this are completely different, there is no need to elaborate",</p>
<p>Li continued to elaborate on the historical roots of Soviet-Turkish friendship, saying, "Because of the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, the situation in important regions such as the Black Sea coast and the locations of the two countries is stable and peaceful. Therefore, Soviet-Turkish friendship is one of the most important factors in the world peace system. I am sure that friends of peace will understand and value the significance of Soviet-Turkish friendship, and only a few countries whose foreign policies are contrary to the principles of international peace, stability, and trust can attempt to undermine it. They have carried out this kind of attempt in the past and are doing so now, although the highest leader of Turkey has resolutely informed them that this kind of attempt is destined to complete failure. I can now, on behalf of the entire Soviet government, reiterate to them that this kind of means of destroying the European peace group and the mainstays of peace will never be able to harm the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, which can be destroyed. "The Soviet Union is carrying out preliminary work to consolidate world peace based on the principles of collective security and the indivisibility of peace. Turkey participates in everything. I am very pleased about this. At the same time, Soviet-Turkish friendship has another special feature, that is, the two countries have the freedom to interact with third countries in their own interests, but because the driving force of this friendship is the common positive will to safeguard world peace, the two sides will of course unanimously avoid any actions that may help the forces of aggression and destruction, strengthen them, or harm any factor in the potential for peace. At the same time, the two sides will always be guided by the same principle, that is, the enemy of its allies and the enemy of peace can never become the friend of its own country. However, even if one of the two sides violates this principle, its allies should only point it out in a friendly manner, so as not to damage the friendship.</p>
<p>"We are now evaluating the political relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and we should also point out the good influence of political friendship on economic and cultural relations. The visit of Turkish friends to the Soviet Union this time will undoubtedly further develop and improve this relationship, thereby making the whole world more aware of the immutability of Soviet-Turkish friendship and reminding it of the principles on which this friendship is based, so that the cause of peace will benefit deeply" (TASS telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister's Reply</p>
<p>[Moscow] Turkish Foreign Minister Aras replied, saying, "Soviet-Turkish friendship will always be a stable factor in the policies of the two countries. There is a special feature in our diplomatic relations, that is, the two countries will always cooperate in the international arena to strive for their due status. This is suitable for both sides, and at the same time, it does not hinder either side from having complete freedom to develop relations with third countries for its own interests and special circumstances. Our mutual affairs are completely open and do not include military agreements or any special treaties. Of course, we must always pay attention to each other's fate. Under these conditions, the friendship between the two countries can be called 'special friendship.' "Soviet-Turkish friendship is not only a permanent and valuable factor in the diplomatic relations between the two countries, but also in all regions where the two countries are located, especially the Black Sea coast. From this, our friendship has become an important factor in the system of indivisible peace and collective security. Our visit this time will further enhance the mutual relations between the two countries in terms of politics, economy, and even culture, and at the same time, it will make the world aware of the strength of our friendship. This friendship cannot be shaken by anything and will always serve peace." (TASS telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Expiration of the German-Polish Treaty on the Upper Silesia Question</h3>
<p>The Two Countries Obtain Full Sovereignty in the Divided Areas. Border Traffic and Commerce Have Been Agreed Upon.</p>
<p>Warsaw Before the European War, the province of Upper Silesia originally belonged to Germany. The Treaty of Versailles after the war stipulated that a referendum should be held in the province to determine which country it belonged to. As a result of the referendum on March 20, 1920, part of the land in the province leaned towards Poland, and another part of the land leaned towards Germany. Subsequently, Germany and Poland concluded a treaty in 1922 to temporarily divide Silesia into two areas under German and Polish jurisdiction. The areas under German jurisdiction are Gleiwitz, Radibor, and Tarnowitz, and part of Beuthen. The areas under Polish jurisdiction are Lubliniec, Tarnowitz, Katowice, Rybnik, and Konigshutte, and the other part of Beuthen. The above-mentioned divided areas are stipulated by the German-Polish Treaty as a temporary measure and are limited to fifteen years. Now, as of midnight today, the restrictions of the German-Polish Treaty have expired. Therefore, the two countries have obtained full sovereignty in the areas currently divided. The area under Polish jurisdiction will be changed to the Autonomous Province of Upper Silesia. The autonomous system will be determined after the parliament meets on July 20. The Polish newspapers are now expressing satisfaction with the expiration of the German-Polish Treaty, but say that Germany has gained more than Poland (Agence Havas dispatch on the 14th).</p>

<h3>Soviet Aviators Land in San Jacinto</h3>
<p>Covering over 6,000 Miles in Sixty Hours, Breaking Two Non-Stop Flight Records</p>
<p>[Washington] Soviet aviator Gromov made a long-distance call in San Jacinto, California, informing Soviet Charge d'Affaires in the US Vorontsov that he had landed there at 1:30 PM today, after flying non-stop for sixty hours and six minutes from Moscow, covering a total of 6,750 miles. The plane still had the power to continue. The reason for landing in San Jacinto was that he wanted to land in the US. If he had gone further, he would have entered Mexico. Gromov also said that the journey was smooth, but when he flew to San Diego, the weather was bad. Due to poor visibility, he could not find a place to land. He circled the city for two hours and then flew to San Jacinto. According to the world record for non-stop long-distance flight, it was created by French aviators Rossi and Codus in 1933, with a flight of 5,657 miles. Gromov exceeded it by more than 1,000 miles, which is an amazing achievement. After President Roosevelt received the news that the plane had landed safely, he sent a warm congratulatory telegram, congratulating Gromov on his great achievement (Reuters dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The three Soviet aviators who set a new world record for long-distance flight this morning have taken a US Army plane to March Air Force Base near Riverside, California. It is said that they landed at 6:30 AM this morning (local time), totaling about sixty-two hours of continuous flight in the air, arriving near San Jacinto, California. Due to oil leakage, they had to land in a pasture. Both the people and the plane showed no damage. At that time, the three people did not know where they landed, only fifteen miles from March Air Force Base.</p>
<p>Gromov told people, "French aviators once wanted to fly from Paris to San Diego. We have flown here from Moscow to show them." It is reported that the Soviet aviators have created two non-stop flight records this time, one for straight-line flight and one for winding flight (National Telegram on the 14th).</p>
<p>Encountering a Cyclone During the Flight</p>
<p>[San Francisco] After Soviet aviator Gromov landed near the city of San Jacinto, California, he told a Havas News Agency reporter, "The plane I was driving rose to a height of 5,480 meters when flying over the skies of Los Angeles. At that time, because the air was thin, I had to use the oxygen I had prepared. Also, from the Rudolf Island to the Arctic section of the flight, the weather was very cold and the wings began to ice up. However, we had special equipment, so we were able to remove the ice and continue flying. As for the engine's performance, it was perfect. If the weather had been better when we first took off, I could have flown to Mexico. Unfortunately, we encountered cyclones several times along the way, so we had to detour. When we approached San Jacinto, we discovered that the gasoline was about to run out. I was very surprised, but I was still confident that I would be able to safely complete this flight without suffering any accidents," (Note: San Jacinto is 120 kilometers north of San Diego, and San Diego is adjacent to the Mexican border) (Agence Havas dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<p>Arctic Radio Station Guides the Direction</p>
<p>[Moscow] Aviation personnel believe that the establishment of regular flights between Russia and the United States is now a certainty. Gromov's plane is an AN-25, which is five years old. As for the latest Soviet aircraft, its range can reach 25,000 kilometers. In addition, meteorologists said that Gromov's success this time relied on the radio station (which Soviet explorers recently established in the Arctic Ocean) to guide the direction, because the magnetic compass is ineffective in the Arctic region (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<p>Russian and American Authorities Send Congratulatory Telegrams</p>
<p>[Moscow] Party and government leaders here and members of the Second Russia-America Aviation Preparatory Committee sent telegrams to the three aviators to congratulate them, saying, "We congratulate you on the glorious success of this direct flight across the Arctic between Russia and the United States, and for creating a new world record for straight-line long-distance flight. We deeply admire the bravery and skill you have shown in creating a new victory for the Soviet aviation industry. All Soviet workers are proud of your success. We embrace and shake hands with you," (TASS telegram on the 14th).</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram to Soviet aviator Gromov to congratulate him, saying, "I admire your flying feat. I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you," (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th).</p>

<h3>Spain Issue: Britain Again Proposes a Compromise</h3>
<p>Specifies New Methods for Maritime and Land Monitoring; Recognition of Belligerent Status After Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>[London] At the request of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, the British government has drafted a number of proposals to fill existing gaps in the monitoring plan, allowing the non-intervention policy to continue. These proposals have been submitted today to the London representatives of the twenty-six countries involved in the Non-Intervention Agreement, accompanied by a statement saying that the British government's work has not been easy. Any proposal with a chance of success must not only integrate the very different opinions of all parties, but also be an effective system of non-intervention. However, the British government has exhausted all its efforts to devise a plan in the hope that it will lead to a unanimous solution to the current difficulties. In presenting its proposals, the British government is deeply aware that this is a compromise between various different opinions, and success can only be hoped for if the governments concerned can accept it in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession. The countries participating in the Non-Intervention Committee have repeatedly stated that they wish to see the non-intervention measures continue to be effective, and now there is an opportunity to realize their aspirations. If the spirit of international cooperation is not demonstrated more than before, this plan will ultimately fail, and European countries will encounter an even more dangerous new situation. The British government's proposed outline is divided into five sections:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding the reform of the monitoring system, this section stipulates that personnel should still be stationed on ships entering Spanish ports to monitor them. As for the naval monitoring system, it will be abolished, and an international personnel monitoring group will be established in Spanish ports with the consent of both sides of the Spanish conflict and under appropriate guarantees. Regarding land traffic entering Spain, it is advocated to immediately restore the land border monitoring system.</p>
<p>㊁ Regarding methods to deal with the current situation and supplement certain gaps in the monitoring plan, this section, in order to make the implementation of non-intervention by governments more effective, advocates that the governments participating in the Non-Intervention Agreement should recognize that both sides of the Spanish conflict have the status to exercise their belligerent rights at sea in accordance with international law. However, both sides must comply with the following special conditions: (A) The list of contraband passed by the belligerents must be consistent with the list of prohibited items passed by the Non-Intervention Committee. In other words, each country only recognizes a limited list of contraband. However, the belligerents may, after negotiation, include other items in the list of prohibited items. (B) When exercising belligerent rights at sea, both belligerents agree not to disturb the traffic of ships carrying observers and flying the flag of the Non-Intervention Committee. However, this clause does not apply to ships engaged in non-neutral activities, such as carrying troops, transmitting information, or disrupting effective blockades. (C) International shipping between countries, except for Spain, when in an area close to the Spanish coast, the Spanish belligerents must not take any action to hinder or interfere with the traffic of neutral ships not engaged in trade with Spain. (D) Any government participating in the Non-Intervention Agreement has the right to protect ships flying its flag against the exercise of belligerent rights by belligerents that do not comply with the established conditions. This second section also stipulates that in order to prevent ships carrying observers from shipping munitions, the Non-Intervention Agreement should be supplemented to prohibit ships flying the flag of a signatory country of the Non-Intervention Agreement from shipping goods listed in the contraband list from any port to Spain, and stipulates that the Non-Intervention Committee should notify countries that have not joined the Non-Intervention Agreement of its intention to recognize the belligerent status of both sides of the Spanish conflict in accordance with the attached conditions, and ask for their cooperation so that the non-intervention policy will be more effective. The Non-Intervention Committee should reconsider the issue of foreign aircraft flying into Spanish territory for use by both sides, and study whether it is possible to ask the belligerents to allow foreign observers to be stationed at airfields within Spain.</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, this section advocates that the Non-Intervention Committee should unanimously pass a resolution stipulating that foreigners proposed in the report of the technical committee to be withdrawn should leave Spain according to law, and advocates that the committee send personnel to Spain to arrange with the belligerents and supervise the withdrawal as soon as possible. Governments should cooperate to ensure that the withdrawal of volunteers can be realized.</p>
<p>㊃ This section states that the British government recommends that the above plan be implemented in the following stages: (A) Establishing an international monitoring group in Spanish ports as soon as possible and abolishing naval monitoring. (B) Establishing a committee to prepare for and supervise the withdrawal of foreign troops, and expanding the Non-Intervention Agreement. (C) After the Non-Intervention Committee confirms that the withdrawal of foreign troops is proceeding smoothly and foreign troops have begun to withdraw successively, the recognition of belligerent rights can be implemented.</p>
<p>㊄ The final section recommends that the Non-Intervention Committee authorize the British government to immediately begin discussions with both sides of the Spanish conflict based on the following points: (A) Establishing an international monitoring group in Spanish ports. (B) The withdrawal of foreign volunteers and the establishment of a committee stationed in Spain to handle this matter. (C) Conditions for recognizing belligerent rights.</p>
<p>The full text of the British government's proposal is about 1,500 words, and has been disclosed by newspapers today. The British government drafted this document entirely on its own initiative and did not consult with other countries, as the British government is exercising the full authority granted by the unanimous vote of the Non-Intervention Committee and is eager to produce a fair and feasible plan. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>British Proposal Can Serve as a Basis for Discussion</h3>
<p>France Agrees; Germany and Italy Still Have Problems; Non-Intervention Committee to Meet Today</p>
<p>⊙London The High-Speed Committee on Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War will hold a meeting at 11:00 a.m. on Friday (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch on the 14th).</p>
<p>⊙Paris France considers the new British proposal on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War to be well-considered and to demonstrate statesmanship. France believes that the provision for international observers to be stationed in Spanish ports to replace the naval monitoring system is a timely and sensible plan, but has doubts about its effectiveness. The French government will pay close attention to the recognition of the belligerent rights of both sides when the withdrawal of volunteers from both sides is underway. France believes that this point is crucial, and advocates that this right should only be granted to both sides after all volunteers have been withdrawn. People here now hope that the countries will recognize the British plan as the last resort for the Non-Intervention Committee to avoid the increasingly serious international situation leading to a major war. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany believes that the proposals contained in the British government's proposed plan for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War can serve as a basis for discussion. In the eyes of Germans, the order in which the various sections of this plan must be implemented is a point that must be resolved first. People in Berlin believe that the Non-Intervention Committee's meeting tomorrow may not be able to reach a final decision immediately, as the key to the success or failure of this matter is whether the Spanish government has the right to restrain volunteers. It is generally acknowledged that the British proposal has included many of Germany's views, and it is generally felt that the deadlock has been broken. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>⊙Rome The authorities are studying the new British proposal on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and do not want to add any comments at this time. However, according to non-political opinions, Italy may accept the British proposal in principle, but will attach a reservation to delay its implementation. It is heard that the main difficulty will be the withdrawal of volunteers (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 15th).</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Portugal Regarding the monitoring measures on the land border between Portugal and Spain, official circles recently stated that the Portuguese government does not intend to restore them at this time (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 15th).</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the British government's proposed compromise on the monitoring plan for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Yorkshire Post (known as the mouthpiece of Foreign Secretary Eden) commented and issued a warning to Germany and Italy, saying, "If a certain country's government arbitrarily picks and chooses the clauses contained in the compromise, agreeing to a certain clause that is beneficial to its protected Spaniards and rejecting a certain clause that is detrimental to itself, then the case will only be in vain, and the hypocritical mask of these countries' violation of the non-intervention policy will inevitably be exposed. In short, the plan proposed by Britain must be accepted in its entirety from beginning to end, otherwise the British government will no longer make fruitless efforts," etc. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Publishes Statistical Yearbook</h3>
<p>World Economy Trends Towards Prosperity; Industrial Production Increases</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations has published its Statistical Yearbook, containing a variety of surprising figures. In terms of economic activity, unemployment, number of workers, production volume, commerce and transportation, most countries have shown signs of progress since 1933. The quantity of major products in 1936 was greater than in 1929, and 1929 was the time when the world economy was far from the peak of economic prosperity before the outbreak of the economic panic. Gold production increases every year, increasing by 12% in 1936, which is double the amount of the previous decade. The world's industrial production increased by 16% in 1936, and world trade increased in both quantity and value. In terms of aviation, the number of miles flown increased by 75% from 1931 to 1935 (there are no accurate statistics for 1936). The rise in prices and the increase in currency are also signs of economic prosperity. (National Maritime Telegraph dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>French Celebrate National Day with Army Parade</h3>
<p>Mass Gathering in National Square; Tricolor Flag and Red Flag Reflect Each Other</p>
<p>[Paris] Today is the French National Day. The army parade was held on the Champs-Élysées at 9:00 a.m. President Lebrun, King Carol II of Romania, the country's Chief of General Staff General Sichitu, the Sultan of Morocco, and members of the French cabinet all attended the event. The grand occasion was unseen for many years. The army's mechanized units began to parade at 10:20 a.m. At the same time, 600 aircraft flew in formation in the air, in orderly fashion, which was spectacular. One of the fighter planes crashed into the Seine River, but the pilot managed to swim ashore. Members of various groups affiliated with the Popular Front began to line up in four teams in the Place de la Bastille at 2:30 p.m. and marched, and dispersed in the suburb of Vincennes at 7:00 p.m. The total number of participants in the parade was no less than hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>In addition, a mass meeting was held in the National Square. The square was full of French flags, flags of the Spanish Republic, and red flags. At the beginning of the meeting, Aviation Minister Cot read Prime Minister Chautemps' letter to the people of Paris, which stated that since the French democracy swore to organize the Popular Front on the National Day of 1935, although it has gone through various obstacles, its unity and strength are unprecedented. In short, the Popular Front is not an organization of internal suspicion, but a necessary tool for building a new society of humanitarianism. The Blum cabinet served for a year and achieved great results. Later, former Prime Minister Blum, in order to adapt the various social reforms that have been implemented to the environment, announced a temporary suspension of other social reform projects. However, the financial oligarchic forces could not see this and launched an attack. The former cabinet had to ask the parliament for full financial authority, but it was rejected by the Senate. The former cabinet wanted to avoid disputes, which would please the dictatorial countries, so it resigned and reorganized the Chautemps cabinet. Now the parties affiliated with the Popular Front have decided to support the Chautemps cabinet and provide it with sincere assistance on a daily basis to jointly complete the Popular Front's platform. Finally, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Shiyu, gave a speech, saying that the General Confederation of Labor has an unshakable determination to defend its victory. Referring to the international situation, he said that the danger of war is increasing day by day. Those who destroy the people's freedom and rights in their own countries are now working hard to cause a universal global catastrophe. Fascism is now taking the opportunity to attack democracy. We ourselves also have our weaknesses, which must not be ignored. In short, what we need today is to restore respect for the rule of law, and even if this effort is more difficult than before, we should work together to achieve it.

<h3>Japanese Warships Arrive in Fujian and Guangdong to Demonstrate Power</h3>
<p>Six Warships Depart from Magong Port; Japanese Women and Children in Shantou Return to Taiwan</p>
<p>Shantou dispatch: The Japanese Third Fleet, which has been cruising in the waters of Fujian and Guangdong, was ordered in mid-June to return to Taiwan for concentrated exercises, using the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong as the target of the exercises. After the exercises on the 27th of that month, the warships gathered at the important port of Magong, waiting for orders to depart. However, since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the fleet has been sending warships to Shantou under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese. At 5:30 p.m. on the 9th, the Wutake and Wakatake destroyers had already entered the port of Shantou. The Japanese side did not notify our authorities in advance. After the warships arrived in Shantou, the Japanese consulate in Shantou only notified the municipal government by telephone. A formal letter was sent as a supplement on the 10th, stating that the warships came to Shantou to protect overseas Chinese. It is heard that six warships departed from Magong Port at the same time. The Fuyo and Sanae went to Fuzhou, and the Asagao and Karukaya went to Xiamen, all arriving on the same day. The Wutake and Wakatake came to Shantou. In addition, the Akikaze, Harukaze, and Hataze of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, and the Asakaze, Matsukaze, and Hatakaze of the Seventh Destroyer Flotilla, led by Commander Okuma of the Yubari flagship, also departed for the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong at noon on the 11th. According to their propaganda, they are patrolling and guarding, but it is difficult to believe.</p>
<p>As for after the Wakatake and Wutake arrived in Shantou, the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou gradually became tense, and rumors became more and more prevalent. The Japanese gather at the residents' association every night, report orally on what they have seen and heard in the city, and listen to the Japanese authorities' news about China. The agents who infiltrate the inland areas of Chaozhou and Shantou drive around in their own cars to scout military and political intelligence. These agents have been extremely busy in recent days and are ubiquitous. It is heard that a certain foreign firm has telegraphed to stop sending goods to Shantou. Japanese women and children have been ordered to leave the country first and move to Taiwan temporarily. Japanese nationals of conscription age are preparing to return to their country to enlist. In addition, the Japanese Residents' Association has decided on four temporary gathering places: ㊀ Toyo School, ㊁ Zhongmalu Branch School, ㊂ Japanese Elementary School, ㊃ Bo'ai Hospital. It has also secretly formed a rescue team and a traffic team. On the 11th, the Japanese consulate in Shantou instructed the residents, saying that those who do not have important business at night do not need to go out and in much. Business is currently slow, and shops can close at 6:00 p.m. Do not say or do anything that irritates the Chinese. As for the Japanese women and children, they have already gone to Taiwan in order. Only one or two people are left to guard each Japanese business firm. However, the traces of ronin in the city have suddenly increased, to about one hundred people, all posing as if they are ready to go. (14th)</p>

Unexpectedly, this time, after the governor Wei Lihuang led the troops to suppress them, the entire fake 28th Army of Gao Junting was wiped out in just one month. All sectors of Hefei celebrated at 9 am on the 12th, with flags hung throughout the city. A celebration meeting of all sectors to celebrate the victory in bandit suppression was also held at the county party headquarters, with more than a thousand people participating.</p>

<p>Establishing a Flood Control Office and Postponing Opening the Dams</p>
<p>Ma Zhenbang, the magistrate of Jiangdu County, was previously appointed by the Water Conservancy Bureau as a concurrent flood control commissioner. Currently, the flood control matters in the east and west sections of the Yangtze River are very important during this period of frequent thunderstorms and rising river and lake tides. Therefore, he ordered Shu Guohua, the director of the Construction Bureau, to send Zhang Hanqing, a technician from the Construction Bureau, and others to Guadong and Doutianmiao on the 13th to set up a flood control office, with a term of four months. Also, because Chen Enxi and other representatives of the lake farmers in the eighth and ninth districts requested the opening of the Fengbi Dam and other dams, a notice was issued in accordance with the order of the Canal Engineering Bureau, stating that the opening standard of each dam should be based on the Shaobo Sancheng Gate Zhi Zhuang one zhang and four chi (building scale), opening the Fenghuang and Jinwan dams one zhang and five chi, opening the Lanjiang Dam one zhang and six chi, and opening the Bihe Dam. The current water level has not yet reached the corresponding water level mark and should be discussed later.</p>

<p>Abolishing the Land Tax Collection Office</p>
<p>The land in this county has been reorganized since the Qingliang exchange order was issued in the second year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, more than 70 years ago. The changes in topography and the loss of title deeds have reached an extreme state of disorder. Therefore, with approval, Dong Jinzhao was commissioned to establish a land administration bureau to thoroughly reorganize it. Over the past five years, in accordance with the provincial plan, he has worked hard and personally handled all matters, large and small, and completed the measurement and registration of land and all ownership documents. Various disputes arising from land reorganization have also been resolved at any time. The county government has approved the standards of land prices legally estimated for all townships and cities in the county, and announced the determination of land price tax registers, which have been approved by the provincial hall to be implemented from August of this year, in order to equalize the people's burden and increase local revenue. At the same time, the land tax collection office will be abolished and the collection office will be abolished. In the future, all land sales, inheritances, and gifts will be handled by the bureau for transfer registration.</p>

<h3>Waging War and Comforting Soldiers: The Chamber of Commerce and Other Organizations Actively Promote Swift Fundraising to Send Money to the Front</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Chambers of Commerce in Various Places</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of this city telegraphed yesterday to the federations of chambers of commerce and chambers of commerce in various provinces and regions at home and abroad, saying, "The telegram from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce and the trade associations of various industries in the city stated that the Japanese army's provocation at the Lugou Bridge has continued, proving that it stems from a predetermined plan to occupy North China by force. In recent days, although we have relied on our garrison to fight to the death, the enemy has not succeeded, but they are assembling divisions and advancing step by step, and the situation is extremely dangerous. It is by no means possible to restore normalcy through peaceful negotiations. Then, our Chinese nation, at this moment of life and death, should rise up together, unite in the spirit of living together and dying together, and support our soldiers defending the territory at the front. Since the September 18th National Humiliation Incident, our central government, for the sake of maintaining peace in East Asia, has always wanted to use the righteousness and humanity of the same script and race to coexist and prosper, hoping that they would reflect and become aware. But they are inherently wolfish and unwilling to repent. From then on, we have reached a point where we can no longer tolerate or avoid it. What is the foundation of a country in the world? It is the national spirit. It is better to be a shattered jade than an intact tile. The ancient训昭垂 can be used as a guide. The soldiers at the front have already given their lives without hesitation, and how can we, the people in the rear, bear to live in ease and eat our fill while waiting for extinction? It is said that if the skin is gone, what will the fur cling to? Reducing clothing and food is enough to make up for military needs, and self-reliance can prevent money from flowing out, so as to avoid the enemy sucking our blood and turning it into lethal weapons to kill our compatriots. Defending against humiliation and saving the nation is our unshirkable responsibility. Make the gift of stringed instrument high for soldiers. It is most essential to fulfill the ambition. And show us the talent of the tax. Everyone should do their best to overcome national difficulties, so that the continuation of Huang Yan will not be cut off. The opportunity is urgent, and we should plan urgently. "The above is based on the telegrams of tears and anticipation." According to this, our Chinese nation has suffered imperialist aggression because of its love of peace. Now it has reached the final juncture of life and death. The rise and fall of the country are the responsibility of everyone. I hereby telegraph to your association for your reference. I hope that you will quickly unite all sectors to organize a city-wide or county-wide support association for soldiers fighting against the enemy. In addition to persuading all sectors to donate freely, you should also inform each store and factory to donate one-tenth of their one-day business income, which will be handed over to your association to be remitted directly to the soldiers at the front as the first consolation money. And report the handling situation to this association at any time. I hope that compatriots will love the country and have the same heart. I urge you to actively handle it. I hope so, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, deleted and printed,</p>
<p>Donations from All Walks of Life and Promotion of Donations</p>
<p>The Anti-Enemy Soldiers Support Association organized by the China Marine Engineers Federation held a meeting at 10:00 am yesterday and decided to notify marine engineers across the country to unanimously serve as a backing and enthusiastically donate money to comfort the soldiers. The notice stated, "Our marine engineers are important technical personnel of the country. How dare we lag behind others in saving the country? We must unanimously prepare and vow to be a backing to fulfill our national duty. This association has initiated the organization of an Anti-Enemy Soldiers Support Association and the members have initiated donations. A total of one hundred yuan was donated during the meeting and has been remitted to the front for consolation. Now that the war is becoming more serious, rear support is urgent. We have always admired the patriotic enthusiasm of the members and hope that they will enthusiastically donate and raise huge sums of money to comfort the front and boost morale. The future of the nation is deeply relied upon." ㊁The Shanghai University Federation, at a temporary members' meeting a few days ago, decided to collect 5,000 yuan of consolation money first, which has been remitted separately and entrusted to the head office of Xinhua Bank to remit all of it yesterday. In the future, teachers and staff of each member school will donate one day's salary to collect funds and continuously supply the front. The association also plans to hold another meeting today and tomorrow to discuss support work. ㊂The teachers and students of Fudan University sent a telegram of consolation, saying, "To Committee Chairman Song of Beiping and all the soldiers of the 29th Army: Your heroic resistance against the enemy has invigorated the country. In addition to collecting 500 yuan and sending it to the Shanghai University Federation, we will continue to be your backing." ㊃The members of the Shanghai Youth United National Salvation League have been collecting donations separately and have collected 128 yuan and 6 jiao of legal tender, which has been remitted to the soldiers at the front as the first batch of donations. They have also issued a notice to expand the scope of donations.</p>
<p>Telegrams of Condolences with One Voice</p>
<p>㊀Zheng Luosheng, Li Menggeng, and others telegraphed national newspapers and groups, and forwarded them to the elders and children of various provinces, saying that they had sent a message to Committee Chairman Song of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and Mayor Qin and Commander Feng of Beiping, urging them to persevere with determination and carry through to the end, and that all the elders and children of our circle should contribute money and effort to resist the thieves. The final victory depends on one heart. ㊁The Citizens' Association of the Second Special District of this city telegraphed Song Zheyuan, requesting him to lead the 29th Army to bravely resist the enemy in order to maintain a glorious history. ㊂The Special Party Department of the Shanghai Security Team of the Chinese Kuomintang telegraphed Committee Chairman Song, requesting him to make persistent efforts to defend the country. ㊄The Chinese Boy Scout Friendship Association is preparing to organize a battlefield service team, vowing to serve the country to the death and fight for the survival of the nation.

The transportation is cut off and the people are slaughtered. Fortunately, the entire army is loyal and courageous in resisting, and their great righteousness is awe-inspiring and shines through the ages. The survival of the nation is deeply relied upon. All citizens wish to be your backing. We first express our condolences and respectfully await good news. The Shanghai Bar Association kowtows." ㊉㊁The Shanghai Machinery Made National Goods Factory Federation received a telegram from Song, saying, "I have read the telegram. The Lugou Bridge Incident is the responsibility of our army to defend the territory, and it is only natural. The association has the same hatred for the enemy and is honored to receive your telegram of condolences and the collection of funds to reward the army. The entire army is inspired. I hereby reply with thanks. Song Zheyuan, Commander of the 29th Army of the Army, and all the officers and soldiers kowtow in the cold. "</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department is in Normal Alert</h3>
<p>Sending Patrols in Plain Clothes to Serve, Predicting that No Accidents Will Occur in Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that a senior official of the Municipal Council Police Department stated today (the 15th) that due to the incident in North China, the Police Department has taken normal alert measures, but has not issued a discussion to increase the number of uniformed patrols, which was often done in the past in similar situations. The service patrols have special orders, the content of which cannot be disclosed for public safety. The residents have been unusually quiet in the past few days, and no one has moved from Zhabei and Hongkou. The migration of residents is often a sign of brewing incidents. Now that no one is moving into the concession, it is a sign of the stability of the overall situation in Shanghai. It is expected that no accidents will occur in Shanghai, but the Police Department especially hopes to take precautions. In the past, whenever there was a situation like the current one, an effective system was implemented so that the Police Department could know everything in advance. It is heard that if student groups or other groups demonstrate in the concession, they will be immediately disbanded, and no groups will be allowed to gather in public places. The French Concession Police Department is also taking the same precautions, but the patrols will be in plain clothes, as increasing the number of uniformed officers patrolling the city would only disturb the people.</p>

<h3>Minister Kong Telegraphed Xu Kan to Invite Leaders from All Walks of Life to Talk</h3>
<p>If There are Those Who Do Not Know How to Love the Country and Only Seek Private Gain, the Government Has Strict Ways to Deal with Them</p>
<p>Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, people in Shanghai have been quite indignant. There are those who do not understand reason and are insane, who do not understand the meaning of loving the country and try to take the opportunity to seize undue benefits, causing the bond market to fluctuate greatly and causing unrest in the market. Minister Kong, far overseas, is extremely concerned. Yesterday, he telegraphed Vice Minister Xu Kan to inform all parties to deal with the situation calmly. Vice Minister Xu flew from Gu to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. He convened leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai on the third floor of the Central Bank at 11:00 am yesterday. Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Chen Xing, Xi Demao, Li Zhilian, Song Hanzhang, Bei Songsun, Bi Jiang, Li Fusun, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Shaoxian, Wu Yunqi, Zhu Runsheng, Shao Yanshan, Xu Xinliu, Xu Jiliao, Yang Jiemei, Zhang Weirun, and more than 20 other people attended. Vice Minister Xu spoke, saying that the government has a proper way to deal with the Lugou Bridge Incident. Over the years, whenever the country has encountered major crises, people from all walks of life have been able to unite and wholeheartedly support the government's policies, and the people's hearts have been stable, and all have turned danger into safety. At this time of serious national crisis, you are all leaders from all walks of life and have always been patriotic. You must all unanimously despise and hate those who do not understand reason or are insane and try to take the opportunity to profit and disrupt the market. You should guide them in many ways and jointly prevent them. It is important to know that stabilizing the market is a manifestation of unity. Moreover, the legal tender reserves are extremely abundant. Recently, the Sino-US agreement has been concluded, which has further consolidated the government bond fund and paid it monthly without error. The government's efforts to consolidate legal tender and credit have long been trusted by China and foreign countries and need no further explanation. If there are those who do not know how to love the country and only seek private gain, the government has strict ways to deal with them. If you know anything or have any opinions to contribute, we will adopt them as much as possible. Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, reported on the bond market in recent days, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Municipal Federation to Submit Protest Against Shanghai Municipal Council's Interference in Patriotic Movement</h3>
<p>Collecting Evidence of Suppression　Requesting Authorities to Stop It</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council has recently been abusing its police power to wantonly suppress the patriotic movement of our country's citizens. This includes unwarranted interference with propaganda against buying and selling smuggled goods, arresting young people for "singing songs of salvation," and frequently obstructing or prohibiting the performance of films and operas that involve patriotic ideas or national consciousness. Conversely, films such as "New Earth," which promote superiority and provoke international animosity, are allowed to be screened publicly under police protection. The Federation believes that such measures are likely to arouse the resentment of all citizens in the Public Concession and are an unwise move for the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is currently collecting evidence of the Council's repeated suppression of the patriotic movement of Chinese citizens in order to submit a protest and request the authorities to stop it, in order to maintain the national dignity.</p>

<h3>Beef and Mutton Association Urges Colleagues Not to Sell in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Because the French Authorities Have Not Expressed Any Opinion on Cancelling the Transit Tax</p>
<p>The Beef and Mutton Trade Association has launched a campaign to abolish the exorbitant transit fee imposed by the French Concession on every thousand heads of livestock. It has appealed to all sectors and stopped slaughtering cattle at the slaughterhouse company in the French Concession. It has been more than ten days since then. The French Municipal Council has not taken any action. However, in order to deepen this campaign, if the French Municipal Council continues to ignore it, the association will prohibit all beef merchants from selling beef in the French Concession. As for the municipal government's implementation of the slaughter tax, the association has also sent representatives to Beijing to petition the relevant authorities to abolish this tax. The result was satisfactory. The Ministry of Industry also sent personnel to investigate the results of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and stipulated three conditions: ㊀ The slaughter tax is collected, and the tax per head must not exceed two yuan. ㊁ The tax is only collected on beef cattle, and draft cattle are not included. ㊂ If the business tax is implemented, the tax must be abolished. Therefore, the tax can be abolished. The tax has now been approved by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Once approved, it can be implemented by the municipal government. However, the association believes that it costs more than five yuan and one jiao to transport each beef cattle from the place of origin to Shanghai. If two yuan is added, the merchants will not be able to afford it. Therefore, it will invite various trade associations in the city to request assistance in the coming days.</p>

<h3>New Ning Shao Passenger Drank Heavily and Disappeared</h3>
<p>Seemingly Intentionally Drunk and Committed Suicide, Leaving Behind a Long Gown and a Straw Hat</p>

<h3>Opinions of the Public Works Department Subcommittee on Improving Housing Problems</h3>
<p>Approved with Amendments by the Board of Directors</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Committee on Investigating Housing Conditions submitted a report to the Board of Directors in March of this year. At that time, Chinese directors Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, as well as Western director Jin, were appointed to form a committee to study the report and provide opinions. At the Board of Directors meeting the day before yesterday (the 14th), the subcommittee's report was submitted. After discussion by the directors, it was resolved to approve the proposed modifications to the original report. The main points of the subcommittee's report are as follows:</p>
<p>This Committee</p>
<p>has reviewed all the recommendations made in the Report of the Committee on Investigating Housing Conditions (see Chapter 5 of the original report) and carefully considered the modifications needed for each recommendation. Some of the committee's recommendations (such as the eighth item, which suggests that the bureau should encourage and assist in the construction of new-style residences) clearly require further study by the bureau. This committee believes that recommendations 3, 9, and 10 of the original report need to be modified. The remaining items, except for those related to the above three items, can be adopted by the bureau with slight modifications. Recommendation 3 has already caused a lot of misunderstanding. This recommendation concerns the unauthorized alterations of Chinese-style alley houses. According to the current building regulations, these situations are not in compliance. However, in fact, the current building regulations are too strict in this regard. If strictly enforced, it would force a large number of residents to have no houses to live in, given their financial means. Therefore, unless there is an absolute need for safety, the regulations have not been implemented. The Committee on Investigating Housing Conditions is well aware that traditional Chinese-style houses cannot fully meet Western standards. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the current building regulations so that they can be uniformly enforced, ensuring fairness and avoiding excessive difficulties. This committee agrees. In order to clearly express the real intention of this recommendation, it is proposed to change the original recommendation 3 as follows: “㊂ The following nine types of unauthorized alterations are common in Chinese-style houses, and the conditions under which they may be permitted are as follows: Buildings on sun decks and shop roofs. The walls of these buildings must be made of non-flammable materials, the roof must be coated with asphalt, and the interior height must not exceed eight feet. If there are special dangers, handrails must be installed on both sides of the ladder. The front wall of the shop roof building should be five feet back from the front of the shop. The door at the top of the ladder must lead directly to the open air. The skylight must allow sufficient light and air to enter. In the back courtyard with stairs, the skylight must be higher than the floor of the first floor. In case of fire in the mezzanine, there must be a reasonable exit. The mezzanine above should be at least eight feet from the floor, and the mezzanine below should be at least seven feet from the ground. The area of the mezzanine below should not exceed half of the area of the room below. Buildings and door lintels in the alleyways should be allowed to be built if they can maintain the minimum width. Balconies converted into rooms are not allowed to be built, and those overlooking the bureau's roads should be demolished immediately. Stairs in the back courtyard can provide a safer exit in case of fire, so they should be allowed to be built. Doors and windows in the fire wall. If the clear distance between the fire wall and other houses is at least ten feet, it is allowed to open doors and windows on the wall. Hollow ceilings. The current rules prohibiting hollow ceilings should be enforced. Wooden sun decks on the roof and on the roof surface. If there are reasonable safety precautions, they should be allowed to be built. Regarding the existing unauthorized alterations, the Committee proposes to uniformly enforce the above conditions within a scope that can be implemented without causing excessive difficulties, starting with vacant houses, and then proceeding by district to gradually cover the entire concession. Regarding the ninth recommendation, namely limiting the future</p>
<h3>Chinese Buddhist Association Issues a Notice to Perform Salvation Rites for Birds, Beasts, Insects, and Fish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it Ordered Temples Nationwide to Comply, Declaring all Sentient Beings are One Body</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association issued a notice to temples and monks nationwide, stating, "The cruelty of killing is prevalent today. Daily needs for food and clothing harm lives. We Buddhists view all sentient beings as one body and should feel compassion when witnessing cruelty. Although destiny is difficult to change, the method of performing salvation rites should be widely promoted. The Association has decided that Buddhist temples nationwide should recite scriptures and mantras every year on the 19th day of the second month to dedicate merit and perform salvation rites for silkworms and all insects; on the 8th day of the fourth month for fish and all aquatic creatures; on the 19th day of the ninth month for birds; and on the 8th day of the twelfth month for beasts. It is hoped that through the compassionate power of the Three Jewels, the cycle of vengeance can be avoided, and that by sharing the intention of relieving suffering, the result of eliminating calamities will surely be achieved. This notice is hereby issued to all local Buddhist branches, which should forward it to all temples for compliance and make it a regular practice. This notice is specially issued."</p>
<h3>Drug Offender Sentenced to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Plainclothes Chinese detectives No. 1775 and No. 1575 from the Hongkou Police Station specialize in arresting offenders who use heroin as a substitute for opium in the Hongkou area. At 6:35 PM on the 6th of this month, they spotted Yong native Zhang Jinfang (21 years old) lying on the ground inhaling heroin in Jiugeng Lane, Haining Road. Just as he was exhaling smoke, they arrested him, along with his opium pipe, cigarettes, tin foil, lighter, heroin, and other items.

<h3>Jilted Mistress Uses Scalding Water as a Weapon</h3>
<p>Elderly Woman Loses All Her Hair and is Severely Injured; Two Children are Wounded; Perpetrator Slips and is Scalded</p>
<p>Wang Gu, an elderly woman from Ningbo, residing on the upper floor of No. 47 Shangyi Lane, Mengshenfu Road, next to the Xiaocai Market in the French Concession, was having breakfast with her son Wang Agou (14 years old) and nephew Zhu Bailin (9 years old) in their room at 9:00 AM on the 13th of this month. Suddenly, her lover, Zhang Songyou (47 years old, residing at No. 37 Yaodun Pavilion, Qimei Road, Yinxiang District, Hudong), also from Ningbo, rushed upstairs with a bucket of scalding water. Without saying a word, he poured the water over the woman's head, causing her to be scalded and fall to the ground. Zhang, still enraged, poured the remaining water in the bucket on the backs of the two children. The children cried out in pain. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Zhang tried to flee downstairs, but in his haste, he stepped on the hot water, causing him to slip and fall. His legs and left arm were also scalded. Neighbors, hearing the commotion, called the police. The police took Zhang to the police station for questioning and then sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The elderly woman and the two children were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the police. However, the woman's injuries were quite severe. She had lost all her hair, and the skin on her chest and back was peeling off. Her condition was very serious, and there was a risk to her life. The two children's injuries were lighter. Zhang Songyou's burns were slight, and he had recovered somewhat by yesterday. He was taken back to the police station for questioning. He claimed that he had been having an affair with Wang Gu for many years, but recently she had become involved with someone else and often taunted and mocked him, so he retaliated. The police chief ordered him to be detained, pending transfer to the Second Special District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Woman Dressed Up to Burn Incense Robbed on the Way</h3>
<p>Lu, a Cantonese woman, 35 years old, residing at No. 21 Tongren Lane, Wuchang Road, Hongkou, dressed up and went to the City God Temple in the city to burn incense and fulfill a vow at around 11:00 AM yesterday. After finishing, she walked out of the city. When she arrived at the entrance of Yutang Lane on Fangbang Road, she was suddenly confronted by two robbers, both wearing short shirts and pants made of Xiangyun gauze. They blocked her way, pulled out a pistol, pressed it against her chest, and ordered her not to make a sound. They forcibly took off a gold bracelet from her left arm and fled south. One of the robbers fired a shot to prevent pursuit. Afterwards, the woman reported the incident to the Yimiao Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Luo Qianbo Manufactures Domestic Textile Machinery</h3>
<p>Great Success, Praised by All Sides</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Qianbo studied textile engineering and mechanical engineering in Europe and America in his early years. After returning to China, he served at the Wing On Textile Factory and achieved considerable success. He observed the rapid development and prosperity of the textile industry in China in recent years, and the increasing abundance of talent in the industry. Unfortunately, China had no manufacturing capacity for textile machinery and had to purchase it from abroad. Mr. Luo studied this machinery and realized that imports amounted to tens of millions of yuan each year. Although it could be imitated, the imitation was crude and not very useful, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, he devoted himself to research and manufacturing, hoping to recover benefits and rights. Now he has achieved great success. The various machines used in his factory, such as winding machines, thread-making machines, and spinning machines, are indeed comparable to those imported from abroad. Yesterday, Mr. Huang Hongjun, General Manager of China ABC Underwear Textile Factory, and Mr. Yang Zunshan, Factory Manager and Engineer of Jianfeng Yarn Factory, visited the Wing On Yarn Factory in Wusong and were amazed by the exquisite manufacturing, which was indistinguishable from that made in Europe and America. The pig iron produced by ordinary Chinese factories often had sand holes, but this defect was completely eliminated in Mr. Luo's products. It is said that the method he uses to make pig iron is different from that of domestic factories, so his products are vastly different from those made by other Chinese. According to those in the textile industry, they only knew that he was a textile engineering specialist and rarely knew that he was even more proficient in machinery. In the Chinese textile industry, Mr. Luo is one of the few talents who can manufacture and use machinery. Mr. Luo's actions will save a lot of losses in the future and add infinite glory to the domestic textile industry. If people in the textile industry want to visit Mr. Luo's structures, they must first inquire with the Wing On Yarn Factory for permission.</p>

<h3>Tongyuan Silk Shop's Extravagant Expenses: Shareholders Accuse Manager of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>No Profit, How Can He Arbitrarily Draw Remuneration? Numerous Items Such as Entertainment and Transportation Expenses</p>
<p>Jin Ziyuan of Tongyuan Silk Shop on North Wuxi Road, Ruixingfang, and Fan Dongsheng of Gengyuan Silk Shop on Tianjin Road, were recently sued in the First Special District Court by Wang Ziqing, manager of Lianji Silk Factory at No. 255, Lane 10, Youyi Road, through lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng, accusing them of criminal embezzlement and breach of trust. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court, summoning both defendants who were accompanied by their defense lawyers Yuan Hanyun and Wang Puzhang. The plaintiff, Wang Ziqing, then presented the case, stating that on January 6 of last year, the two defendants jointly established Yongkangxing Silk Shop,</p>
<p>Inviting Me to Invest</p>
<p>Each share was 500 yuan, with a fixed capital of 30,000 yuan. I subscribed to 14 shares, contributing 7,000 yuan. Jin Ziyuan subscribed to 6 shares, 3,000 yuan, and Fan Dongsheng subscribed to 3 shares, 1,500 yuan. The two defendants were appointed as managers, responsible internally and externally. If there were any private gains or fraudulent activities, the managers would be responsible for clarifying and settling them. A contract agreement was signed as evidence. Unexpectedly, after taking office, the two defendants squandered public funds in large amounts, violating their duties and fabricating expenses. After inspecting the books, I found that on February 10 of this year,</p>
<p>Payment for Cigarettes</p>
<p>Actually amounted to 679 yuan and 82 cents, which is not an expense that a silk shop should incur. The total entertainment expenses amounted to 1,783 yuan, plus entertainment fees of 820 yuan, remuneration fees of 2,400 yuan, and payments to accountants of 5,747 yuan. Transportation fees, commission fees, etc., were numerous and substantial. According to the defendant's accounting operations, there were no profits, so how could they arbitrarily draw remuneration? This is clearly reporting false expenses and violating their duties, constituting crimes under Articles 336 and 342 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, I am filing a lawsuit and attaching a civil suit seeking compensation for</p>
<p>Embezzled Funds</p>
<p>Of 10,314 yuan and 68 cents, as well as various other business expenses. Account books were presented as evidence. When questioned, the defendants answered the plaintiff's accusations one by one, stating that the cigarettes recorded in the account books were purchased and given to various clients. Although Yongkang and Ji Silk Shops have only been established for a year, their business volume is estimated at over 400,000 yuan. When regular out-of-town clients who were introduced by runners return, at the request of the runners, we purchase</p>
<p>High-Quality Cigarettes</p>
<p>Or cigars and send them as gifts throughout the year, accumulating to over 600 yuan. We did not falsely report these expenses. Moreover, the accountant position was held by Ye Xinyan, recommended by the plaintiff. Ye is fully aware of these matters and can be questioned, as he is present in court. Ye Xinyan then testified, stating that he did not write those specific account entries, but it was true that cigarettes were purchased and sent to clients. Judge Huang reviewed the testimonies and stated that the case still required investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Immediately Launch a War of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident, some say that the other side wants to repeat the old trick of the Fengtai Incident in order to strengthen its control over North China; some say that the other side wants to take the opportunity to create a fait accompli as a bargaining chip in diplomacy; and still others say that the other side, seeing the impending domestic economic crisis, wants to use this to divert the people's attention. These observations are mostly correct. But from my personal perspective, the biggest reason for the occurrence of this incident is probably that the other side has recognized that resisting foreign aggression and resisting Japan has become our country's unanimous national salvation proposition. If they want to carry out aggression again, they have no way to make China yield unless they use military force. Therefore, a group of ambitious young officers had no choice but to rashly come back for another adventure.</p>
<p>Understanding this point, the development of the Lugouqiao Incident is not difficult to predict in advance. Here, I can say without hesitation that if the incident had not occurred, it would have been fine, but since it has occurred, the other side will definitely go through with it to the end. Judging from the situation in the past few days, the incident has obviously deteriorated daily. The military actions in North China, needless to say, have reached the most dangerous juncture. Even in their own country, the atmosphere is very tense. A large number of troops are boarding ships ready to depart, and the Ministry of the Navy and Army is as busy as if it were wartime. These situations are naturally a threat, but they are enough to show the other side's determination. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun expressed the following opinion on this incident: "We hope that, taking this opportunity, we must adopt a countermeasure to eliminate the root causes hidden behind the Lugouqiao Incident. This is the national government's anti-Japanese policy and the centralization of North China." This is the best explanation.</p>
<p>Judging from this, unless our country yields again, the other side will never be willing to give up easily on the future development of the Lugouqiao Incident. Because the purpose of their military action this time is not just to satisfy themselves by invading one or two pieces of land, but they seem determined to not stop until they have forced our country to abolish its anti-Japanese and resistance to foreign aggression propositions. Therefore, this incident will definitely have an increasingly expanding danger in the near future. Because resisting foreign aggression and resisting Japan is our country's unanimous national salvation proposition. This proposition is a major obstacle to the other side's aggressive policy and has the potential to cause conflicts at any time. Prime Minister Konoe believes that this incident is the result of China's anti-Japanese movement. This is naturally a statement that reverses cause and effect, but it is enough to show how much they hate the anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<p>Now that things have come to this, our country's only response is to immediately launch a war of resistance against foreign aggression, otherwise we will only be waiting for the enemy to slaughter us. In the future, the people of the country should not even think about discussing anti-Japanese national salvation.</p>
<h3>How to Move a Theater Troupe to the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Ke Yu</p>
<p>In the current Chinese countryside, the peasant masses are living an extremely hard and tragic inhuman life. There is no doubt that they need encouragement and comfort. Every time a simple drama is performed in a village, it will cause a sensation throughout the village, and even distant audiences will come to watch the play. This is enough to explain how hungry and thirsty the peasants are for drama. If the content of our drama meets their common needs, that is, it is related to their lives; and if we can make it popular and easy to understand in form, then we can guarantee that our theater troupe will be welcomed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the countryside is nurturing a greater force of resistance, and this force needs cultural work such as drama to increase and develop it. Therefore, moving a theater troupe to the countryside is doing the most effective national salvation work that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has spoken of.</p>
<p>So how do we prepare to move?</p>
<p>First, we must do a self-examination, such as: Is my body strong? Can I endure hardship? What are my special skills? Can the peasants understand my language? … Second, we must consider what kind of script is needed. When we go to the countryside to perform, we should first consider whether the content of this play is close to the lives of the peasants. If it is close, then they will easily understand, accept, and enthusiastically welcome it. As for the popularization of the script and the simple and clear structure, these are also two important conditions. Third, there must be a strict organization, in which the clear work of each department is designated. In addition, a singing group and a correspondent should also be attached to the organization to facilitate the progress of our mission. Fourth, we must do several preparatory rehearsals. After each performance, we will convene a symposium to review and improve.</p>
<p>In the process of promotion, we also need to pay attention to the performance of the script:</p>
<p>㊀ Use the special environment When a mobile theater troupe walks to a certain village, it should observe the local situation and change the performance method at any time. For example, at night, some torches can be used. On the farm or village street, you can even do without a script, such as live reports, current affairs reports, street dramas, or sign mime, etc. In short, as long as it has the meaning of national salvation or education.</p>
<p>㊁ Adopt old drama techniques When we go to the countryside to perform, we must pay attention to those "local dramas" and "old dramas" with thousands of years of history in the countryside, or even puppet shows and Qing operas. We can jointly perform these dramas after changing or abandoning the bad parts and preserving the good parts; at the same time, the symbolic techniques of "old dramas" should also be fully adopted in the case of poor material conditions. This method of adopting part of the form of old dramas and its performance methods, and infusing new content, is a necessary method for drama to penetrate into the countryside</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The necessary method for the transition period.</p>
<p>In terms of catering to the psychology of peasants and the rural environment——㊀The life of the members is the same as that of the peasants. The clothes of the members should be simple, the relationship between men and women of the members should maintain dignity, and they should also respect the elderly, otherwise it will cause the peasants to be disgusted. ㊁Do not hinder their work. When the theater troupe goes to the countryside, it must of course take into account the working hours of the peasants, and we should not disturb them during the busy farming season. At the same time, we should pay special attention to their crops and agricultural tools.</p>
<p>When going to the countryside, we can also help promote domestic products, distribute popular publications, and help establish local choirs.</p>
<h3>Respond to Attackers with Attack</h3>
<p>— Li Gan Zuo</p>
<h3>The Parade in July</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Friend:</p>
<p>This happened last year!</p>
<p>The wind in July carried a stuffy, melancholy smell, blowing miserably. Our parade of thousands of people was full of enthusiasm and tension. Passing through the × boundary, the parade was surrounded by ×× defenses. They: took out their guns and held wooden sticks in their hands, sneering at us! They constantly ordered the shopkeepers in the shops on the street, saying, "Hey! Pig, take down the flag!" So the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth was lowered by the elementary school students. Huh! What kind of world is this? Hanging flags is not allowed! So the whole parade rioted, and we shouted slogans like crazy. ×× raised their wooden sticks high and said, "Hey! Pigs, don't yell!" Friend! Think about it, what was going on? Several students rushed over, wanting to punch him a few times, and ×× hurriedly held the gun in his hand, showing a sneer, meaning to say, "Come on! The gun will kill you!" So the few who rushed up retreated like this. Several people rushed to the front of the parade and wrote slogans on the ground, and several people had their fingers trampled by spiked leather shoes, and several were kicked over, and when they turned around, ×× was laughing with a gun in his hand!</p>
<p>Friend! Under helplessness, we turned to the school, wanting to take advantage of the school's dismissal to invite as many lovely students as possible to jointly make a roar of national salvation.</p>
<p>When our parade was near the ×× gate, dozens or hundreds of ×× standing soldiers were in front of us, and they said, "Go back!" Friend! Think about it, what is this? So we were angry, and when a very small cell in this parade shouted "Charge!", our team had already rushed up like a tide!</p>
<p>Friend! You didn't see the tragic situation, did you! Hey! A dozen ×× soldiers grabbed a leading student and beat him. Damn it! They used whips! Sticks! Iron rings of leather belts! They even used gun butts! The student was beaten to the ground, and he screamed miserably, and the ×× soldiers still trampled on him with spiked leather shoes! Friend! We are all Chinese! The second one was treated the same! So: our entire parade rushed up, we didn't have whips, sticks, leather belts, let alone gun butts, but what we had was hot blood! We can shed our hot blood to awaken this group of shameless traitors and lackeys! Friend! At this time, dozens of ×× soldiers were really not enough to deal with us. Just as we were about to break through the ××'s line, two red security vehicles from the ×× Bureau came! I have never seen them catch robbers, nor have they fought enemies. No one would believe that the first application was to beat our group of unarmed students! Hundreds of ×× jumped out of the security vehicles, and they pounced on our parade like a group of hungry tigers! Although we wanted to resist, how could sheep defeat tigers? We could only retreat. At this time, the group of evil tigers went crazy, they rushed towards us, beat us with their weapons, and even liked to beat the female students, and they hit their faces. A female student was grabbed by five or six evil tigers, and they kicked her buttocks with spiked leather shoes! The female student cried miserably, but they smiled with satisfaction! Friend! Think about it, what kind of world is this? We ran away, how shameful it is to say! However, the ×× did not let us go, they rushed towards our team with motorcycles, whipped our heads! Kicked our bodies! Friend! Although we are angry, what can we say except to accept it?</p>
<p>When passing the memorial tower, we held hands, and suddenly, we turned around together, wanting to make a final sprint, but the ××'s weapons drove us back again!</p>
<p>The force of external oppression became greater, and we had to disperse into several small teams and escape into the surrounding alleys, but there were still female students who were caught and beaten!</p>
<p>The parade was dispersed, and the ×× gasped for breath! After all, beating people is also tiring. Five or six cleaners were washing the bright red bloodstains on the street, and there was still heat! This is the patriotic blood! After a while, the trams also passed, and everything continued as usual. Who knew that half an hour ago, there had been a massacre here?</p>
<p>Friend!</p>
<p>This happened last year! It's almost the anniversary again!</p>
<p>However, we must step on the bloodstains of the victims to hold a great and tragic anniversary ceremony!</p>
<p>Our good friends!</p>
