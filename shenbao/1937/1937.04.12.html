<h3>未來戰爭的可怖（上）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>科學殺人的新方法</p>
<p>在下次大戰爭中，我們的青年，要被“死光”燒成灰屑麼？要被“聲浪震動機”震成碎片麼？或要被“死離心力機”殲滅無餘麼？光能射到天空，毀壞飛機麼？可有飛行潛艇，飛行坦克車，天空魚雷，同溫層轟炸機出現麼？能用一種“看不見的烟”，使飛機的引擊窒息，因而墜落在地面麼？兵士將穿着玻璃製的衣服，或者還要帶着鐵籠，以便抵制“死光”麼？這些方法，那幾種可以使用啊？那幾種還在試騐的階段呢？</p>
<p>這幾個重要問題，巳由兩位住在外國的德國人合著了一書，逐條答覆，一是政治學研究者，一是工程師。據兩位著者說：“德國當局現常向人民宣傳，未來的戰爭，全憑着干新發明有極可怖破壞力的戰具取勝。戰事發生後，幾天之內，德國定能慶凱。這些新發明的利器，現在嚴守祕密，任何外國都不知道，所以德國人民對於戰爭，不必恐怖，也不必以戰敗為慮，大可高枕而臥。”這種宜傳運動，又得到世界報紙所載關於神秘的新武器新聞之助，更覺得娓娓動聽。</p>
<p>這些談輪，大半是亳無意識。各國對於他國新武器的發展，都探聽得詳詳細細，國際軍械工業，並不關心軍事秘密，最近的科學新發明，都詳載在各國技衛的雜誌上，各種新器械，都在特許專覽局登記，國際特許專賣機關只要有人肯付酬勞費，都願意把新武器，供給他們。最後還有一事，當牢記的，在軍隊演習中試用新武器，如果失敗，却要遭遇絕大的危險。再者，舉行大規模的試騐，是絕難嚴守秘密的。所以任何國家要想長久獨享一種新武器的便利，是未必有的事。況且今日各國都利用種種聞諜，偵探他國的內情，倘若有人發明一種殺人的新利器，可保不出多時，這個消息便傳遍世界。</p>
<p>由此可見國社主義的德國，絕不致在來年有驚人的大出手。但也不必有驚人的舉動，因為現已知道的，尤其是一九三○年以後所發展的器械，巳夠厲害了。唯一待答的問題，那便是舊時用的軍火，—“改良的”機關槍，大砲，開花彈，炸彈等，—是不是不能及新的更價廉的有效力？</p>
<p>把各種“光”適用在戰爭上，已用過偉大的努力。一般人對於各種“光”，總稱為“死光”。但是那各種“光”所含的科學原則，跟它們的用法，却大不相同。“光”的種類，大約有一打之多，各有各的用法。最為人稱道的，便是那意中以為能毀壞飛機中的發動機，而使飛機不能飛行的一種。據說一個城鎮，四面用這種“看不見的光”包圍着，於是飛機便不能飛過這一道“死線”。不幸這大半還是幻想。這“光”只能播在地面，所以只能制低飛的飛機跟汽車，而且范圍仍舊很有限的。再加用現在保護無線電機械的方法保護引擎，以抵制這“光”，很覺簡單，報上雖說把馬可尼跟台斯拉兩種原則合用在這種防守的武器上，但是還未成眞正的事實哩。</p>
<p>據說還有別的幾種“光”，能損害敵兵的頭繼，分散他們的血液，或燒焦他們的身體，這三層，須用三種不同的“光”。在短距離中，這些光已證明其厲害甚至於能摧毀養氣但是這些“光”都不能遠及，并且用一種鐵或鋼製的籠，可以把它們捉住，使它們失其效力。</p>
<p>還有一種“鉛光”幾乎能及普通光的速度，現亦在試騐之中。這種光彈力還運顯，並且穿了玻璃製的衣服，便能保護全身。這並不是說兵士要藏在玻璃籠中，現在有一種用玻璃絲織成的材料，經穿耐洗，捷克國的玻璃廠已大批製造，廣銷於南美洲，製成女子用的圍巾，光彩奪目。</p>
<p>現在較適實用的，是無線電駕馭遠處的船隻•這種技術，發展已有多時。凡飛機，船隻，坦克車，都能不假人手，而由遠處用無線電使之行動。第一次在海上試驗這個戰術，遠在一八九九年，後來列強每次舉行海軍大演習時，都會試用這種“鬼船”，它們能服從各種命令，如駛往任何方向，使用探照燈，發射魚雷等類。</p>
<p>雖然容量較大的船隻，不能用這個方法駕馭，但是較小的船隻確然能夠隨意駕馭。這些船隻，能用它們安置水雷，或滿載炸彈，衝撞任何目的物。海上旣能用這個方法，那末，那機母艦也能載了許多不用一人的飛機，駛至任何所願的地點，然後使飛機上升，飛至若干哩外，降落在地面，或敵軍的艦上。那些飛機，也能使之作發射魚雷等等工作。</p>
<p>坦克車用無線電駕馭，較為困難，因為它們行在不平的地面，那震動會使運用指導的複雜機關無從行使命令。</p>
<p>因運用指導的機關，不常可靠，又因為目標會忽然變動，所以這種“鬼船”跟“鬼飛機”的效用，是有限的。再加運用指導的機關費用很貴，又容易被人破壞，因此有幾個大國，覺得還是用人，既能省費，又更可靠。日本跟意大利海軍所發明的敢死隊，那是用人力最可怕的一種戰術。日本的方法，是把一個自告奮勇的戰士，—當然還不少候補的人，—伏在一個水雷中間，他在魚雷中，能撥動方向，非常準確。他能重損或擊沉一隻敵艦，犧性個人的生命，去換數百人的生命。意大利的蚊蟲艦隊，也有這種敢死隊，在阿比西尼亞戰爭中，他們曾圖用飛機敢死隊抵制英軍，倘若英軍實行干涉意阿戰事。　　天空魚雷，是一種非常危險的武器，也從遠處指導它的方向，一九二二年據美國米奇爾將軍報告，他曾由長島花園城把天空魚雷三枚發至一百十公哩外的紐遮四州特倫頓鎮，絕對準確。在此之後，且曾經大加改良。這種魚雷能包含若干炸彈，在種種隔離的時間，把炸彈瀉落，或魚雷本身便是炸彈，按照指導的方向，落在危險的地點。</p>
<p>另有一種“光”能使陸地的地雷，或水面的水雷，跟其他炸裂品轟發。還有名叫“盲光”的一種光，它的光力，強勝汽車頭上的燈千傷，兵士觸着這種光，至少暫時目盲，不能見物。跟這相反的，是一種看不見的光，是供夜裏尋覓飛機跟軍艦之用。尋常的探照燈雖然有用，但也有害，因為射照天空，尋覓敵機的當兒，使全區光明，反成敵軍轟擊的目標。新發明的“光”，只有戴特別眼鏡的人能看見。一九三五年美國艦隊在遮西海濱外演習時，曾使用這種方法，成績極佳。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日關係的改善</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>駐日大使許世英十日在南京接見日本新聞記者。發表調整中日關係的意見。謂欲“改善中日關係。須具有三種精神第一為互惠。第二為互信。第三為互助。”這意見興本月五日王外長在京所報告的外交方針。主張經濟合作必須出於互惠平等之旨。有其共同之點經濟的互惠平等乃是所謂親善。所謂合作。所謂“提㩗”的先决條件。在這原則之下。我們希望與他國增進相互的關係。而他國欲與我們增進相互的關係。我們也希望其首先考慮這條件。否則一切所謂親善。所謂合作。所謂“提携。”不是外交辭令。就是欺人之談。</p>
<p>中日關係調整的呼聲。我們聞之已久。而足以改善中日關係的事實。則未之一見。我們所見到的是。鐵騎橫行。侵我領土。浪人走私。侵我關權。易地而處。誰能堪此。我們方面對於一個忍字。可以說做到了。然而對方又如何呢。講到這地方。我們要請對方反省一下。不錯。日本在野在朝人士近來的論調。是有些與以往不同日本考察團返國後兒玉曾謂日本須嚴峻改正其以往對華的外交路線又謂“日本的經濟發展不問在生產的開拓或商務的擴展均根本需要中日間友好關係的維持。到目前為止。中國方面。雖或有不合理的行動然我方也有錯誤之處……所以雙方必須顧及彼此的立塲尤望日方改變以往對華的情感。”似乎日方經濟界政界首腦。都看到這一層。而在對於忍字下一番功夫。實行所謂“己所不欲勿施於人”的恕道了。可是事實恐未必盡然。當我們一方面聽到經濟界政界首腦高唱顧及雙方利害的時候。在另一方面又聽到對華北“採用強硬政策。實屬必要”的消息。這樣的矛盾。也許由於日方外交政策未達我國前外長張羣所謂“一元善化”的地步。然而日本外交政策的“一元善化。”决非現在這樣政出多門的日方政治首腦人物所能辦到。我們知道。一向日本外交當局口頭儘管高唱親善。而日本在華駐屯軍的首腦還是照舊在蠻幹。互惠達不到。互信談不上。互助又從何講起呢。</p>
<p>因此中日關係改善的關鍵。不在我而在彼。彼方對於互惠互信和互助是否有誠意。我們要看事實的表現。而怎樣來促動彼方的誠意。還要靠我們堅决的奮鬥。</p>
<h3>日本林首相閘述內閣新政綱</h3>
<p>行政機構決實行改革　外交政策求舉國一致　充實軍備以應付事變</p>
<p>［東京］林首相十日晚關於現內閣之八大政策、發表談話、其內容如下、</p>
<p>▲文教之刷新　關於文教之刷新、旣有教學刷新評議委員會研究各種問題、如將此各問題具體化、則可達大半目的、然現為澈底研究關於教育政治行政策一切方面之國體感念、擬在內閣內新設審議機關、</p>
<p>▲改革行政機關　關於新設中央航空機關、因今日普及航空思想、努力發達航空事業為至必要、現有獨立此新機關作為一省之說、然尚未確定、至於改正官吏制度之用意、為獲得有能力之人才、然其具體問題尚未考慮、</p>
<p>▲舉國一致的外交　外交問題與軍事同樣、實際上不便詳談其內容、但言其精神、須統一內閣之思想、而逐漸具體實現、以期舉國一致之外交、總之、外交須要公正、而不應成為退步的、屈從的外交</p>
<p>▲國防之充實充實　國防之意、非積極進行某種行動、係強固自己態度、以備萬一事件之發生也、國家總動員的準備亦有同樣精神、</p>
<p>▲其他政策　其他諸政策已在政綱之聲明有所表示、首相又言及總選舉對策及新黨問題、大致謂政黨應有覺悟、運營舉國的政治、打開此難局、政府不應有不正常之干涉、阻害肅正選舉、至新黨問題、世間傳本人有意組織新黨、然此非事實、本人不過希望政黨之改善而已、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］政府於十日之臨時閣議上、已决定八大政策、向內外發表、關於此項政策之實施、林首相特別注意行政機構之整備改善問題、而急於設立內閣企劃廳及成立中央航空行政機關、據林首相之方針、則企劃廳應為內閣之中樞、與各省取得聯絡、而使八大政策具體化、當以此企劃廳為中心機關、聞首相已决意在特別議會之前見諸實現、</p>
<p>關於中央航空行政機關、則現閣內有航空省•航空院•及航空廳三種主張、但林首相認為在日本航空事業之現狀下、欲期航空工業之發達、航空機製造技術之根本研究、乃至積極的指導民事航空、實有設立航空省之必要、</p>
<p>此外、與行政機構問題有關聯之所謂省之廢併問題、則首相以為當此社會情勢益趨複雜之際、因行政技術及其他理由、省部實有增加之必要、總之、首相以為省之多寡雖非所問、內閣自身則應保持強力之統一、故對於以減少省部為目的之省之廢併之說、似全然未予考慮也、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>杉山陸相重視設航空部</h3>
<p>小田原　杉山陸相十日晚搭車赴關西、在車中對記者謂、十日閣議决定之政策中、最要注目者為設立中央航空機關、與澈底實行社會政策之二項、政府擬設有力之中央航空機關、然其具體內容、尚待陸海軍與遞信省商議决定、社會政策中、國民之健身問題為軍部最關心之事、故對於國民健康保險法之實現、不惜進行積極的支援、軍機保護法案鐵政策燃料政策等、與陸軍有關係者、已有準備提出特別議會、要之今次决定政綱、未知世間有如何批評、然可以證明超越廣義或狹義之國防、內閣全體一致軍民合作、向完璧國防目的邁進者也、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>結城藏相考慮抑低物價</h3>
<p>先從煤鐵入手</p>
<p>［東京］結城藏相十一日發表時局談話、謂現內閣新政策中有物價對策、蓋在物價騰貴之現在情形下、不得不以行政手段或省令現定辦法、而謀緊急對策、如有必要在特別議會提出限制物價法案亦未可知、為此目的、先由鐵或煤炭市價着手抑制至為必要、關於鐵旣有免收關稅之緊急勅令、現在諮詢樞密院中關稅近率法之改正案及輸出統制稅等、如有再檢討之必要、則不提出特別議會而待下次普通議會開幕始行提出亦未可知、閣員缺位之補足問題、現由政府考慮中、如從來內閣回樣、由各政黨任命閣員、實無意味、故應組織政府與黨、由此黨取新閣員、（十一日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>日產業界見解</h3>
<p>［東京］產業界方面對於林內閣之新政策、抱持如次見解、政綱中有進行國家總動員一項、可解釋政府為進行此準備、擬向準戰時經濟狀勢邁進、因此令人疑惑政府是否強化國家統制的經濟政策、使人發生一種不安感念、但產業界對於政府企圖振興各種產業擴充生產力之政策、表示同情、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日駐荷公使桑島視察荷印報告</h3>

<p>荷印羣島、受海水及日光之天惠、具有無盡藏之富源、經過當調查之後、知旣存富源因無論矣、卽對於新事業之創辦、亦有充分餘地、故日本人前往活動、乃一廣大之新天地、余嘗與荷印總督及經濟長官乃至該地各方面之人物會晤、彼等對於日本態度甚為親切、並不如國內所想像之具有對日敵意、總督對於日荷協定之成立、亦表示慶賀、並希望將來能因通商貿易之發展及雙方商旅之往來、更增兩國間之相互諒解、更由景氣之恢復及士人購買力之增進、日貨南銷誠有無限之希望也、該地對於日本之南進論、確抱相當之疑念、因彼等覺僅高唱和平的經濟發展、而無事實予以證明、頗滋疑慮、故在日本之企業方面、今後着着在事實上表現和平之精神、實屬必要、此外、卽為需要基礎的準備之企業、不全由日本人獨占、而與荷人協力合作、則除國防及其他有特別關係以外之事業開發、乃日荷雙方之利、荷印亦必欣然贊成也、我人應力避豪語南方發展、而徒予彼等以誤解、確立日本對荷印政策時、務須善自考慮其背後關係、換言之、若以世界的眼光而臨之、則和平的經濟伸展、亦未始為不可能也、（十一日同盟社電）</p>

<h3>內江人才與訟風</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>“上無天子，下無典史。”這是內江人引以自豪的一句流行語。意思是說：內江文風很盛，人才很多。在科舉時代，內江人由仕途飛黃騰達的着實不少，只是他們中間找不出“位加九五”，“富有四海”的天子。和在州縣上“司文書”“主縣獄”（約當現時祕書科長之類）的典史來。（因為內江人不屑做這種小官）</p>
<p>自唐宋以迄明清，如狀元•丞相•少保•大學士之類，在內江，“代不乏人”。入民國以後，教育發達，（計有公私立中等學校三所，小學約五十所）內江的人才，一•質量，似乎也都在他縣以上。可是教育儘管發達。民間對于風水之類的迷信卻還普遍流行。我在內江常聽得堪興家說“某處地形是龍蟠鳳舞呀”，“某山嚮緻”又是硃盒筆架呀”之類的話</p>
<p>內江是四川主要的產糖區。東西長約一百六十里，南北寬約一百十里，偌大的面積，幾乎無處不種甘蔗，卽無處不產糖。每年大宗輸出的糖，約值二百萬元以上。人民的經濟環境，可以想見其優裕了。</p>
<p>內江出產豐裕，教育發達，自成渝路闢宿站於此，市面更日臻繁榮。人民生活，宜乎是“相安相得”的了，可是出乎意料的，好訟之風，郤很盛行。縣府每日收到的訴訟案件，平均在二十件以上。強盜殺人等刑事案，約佔十之三。田產婚姻商務償賬等民事案，約占十之七。有的日子，民事案會多收至四五十件。所以一縣有兩承審員，一軍法官，還忙的“不亦樂乎”。</p>
<p>而且訟費很貴。譬如賬務糾紛，滿一百元的，須繳三元，二百元的繳六元，三百元的繳八元，以上每加三百元，卽遞次加繳二元，為數可謂不靡。請人寫狀子（卽訴訟文），每件至少送三元。政繁傳案，每十里路送一角，政警一類的人物，大多數沒有正薪，所謂“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”，額外的苛索，恰如旗館所開的賬單，算了高貴的房金，并且加上茶水成，還要特別聲明：“小賬在外”。可是訟費雖如此之貴。但人民好訟之風，并不稍減。有一次只為十元的賬務，居然也有人寫狀控訴。原訴人來自遠村，訟畢計其所費，已超過十元之數倍。問他“得回好處”？則答爭點面子！</p>
<p>內江經濟環境優越，告債狀不一定為討賬，難道一般人的富力，都在水平線上麼？那又不然。據說：他們有一種特殊風俗，舊歷正月十五，興到各祠廟去爭點所謂的“上元燈”，有的可多點至數上百盞，有的甚至連一盞也點不起。有一首很普遍的寫實諺語道：“富戶十盞燈，兒童相聚戲；貧民一盞燈，父子相對泣！”由此可以想見當地貧富懸殊的情形了。</p>

<h3>杏花村</h3>
<p>— 陶康君</p>
<p>“清明時節雨紛紛，路上行人欲斷魂：借間酒家何處有？牧童遙指杏花村。“——杜牧　　　　杏花村，道個富有詩意的地名，多少終有些令你喜悅的成份吧？倘若你是愛好醇酒的話，那末，更會令你心醉的了，雖然在目前這荒陋而幽靜的街道上，找不着一家酒舖子，可以讓你縱情地狂飲着，然而單是杏花村三個字，也就夠你領略的了。</p>
<p>據金陵雜記上說：杜牧沽酒的杏花村，是在南京門西瓦官寺的旁邊，因為當時古城的范圍，異常的狹小，所以村花村瓦官寺一帶的地方，都是在城外的，自明太祖建都金陵之後，為了觀瞻上的莊嚴，對於古城就特別的放大，這樣，杏花村瓦官寺就被拉進了門西的角落裏來。</p>
<p>在二十年前，杏花村的居民，為了名符其實的觀念所驅使，可是也種了不少杏樹，所以在春到人間的時候，此地却也很富有畫意似的令你流連着，但是就沒有一家酒舖在這兒點綴點綴，殊令人引以為憾。</p>
<p>事實上，杏花村是太偏僻了，除了幾個以詩書自娛的文人，時時跑到這兒來憑弔憑弔，誰也不願意走進這冷僻的處所。</p>
<p>杏花村，在現在，更形冷落了，連那幾株點綴的杏樹，早巳給一班被生活壓得透不過氣來的朋友，偸着燒鍋去了，倘若此地沒有杏花村三個大字在牆上顯示着，那末，誰也不會記起，這是杜牧沽酒的好去處。</p>
<h3>春在玄武湖</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>可愛的春姑娘，自從帶着暖和的太陽降臨到大地以後，人們的一切，都充滿了春意，當然，在這春光明媚的時候，來作郊外旅行是最快意的事情所以首都玄式湖畔，又充滿了一般有錢而又有閒的遊人。</p>
<p>玄武湖畔的楊柳，受著春光的照耀；春雨的滋潤；早巳新碧滿樹，湖裏的小魚，也都浮在水面上，領受那暖和的太陽；這種景象，眞是美麗極了，古書上的“山清水秀”四個字，大可以來移贈給玄武湖，無怪一般老爺太太，少爺小姐們，都趨之若驚了！</p>
<p>湖裏的小艇，冷落了好幾個月，現在又活躍起來了！那些船娘們，又都擁在湖邊，爭着招徠遊客。湖邊的汽車。馬車；整串的停在那裏，這都是有錢人們所特有的，普通的人們，祗好“望車興嘆”，卽使要領路玄武湖的春景，也祇好“安涉當車”呀！</p>
<p>遊人們大都是成雙作對的，這裏面有新婚夫婦；有未婚夫婦，也有未訂婚的情侶；更有臨時結合的野鴛鴦；他們手攙手的坐在小艇中，容與中流，情話喁喁，那種狀況，眞是不啻神仙眷屬，如果使獨身的男子或是少女們看見了，說不定要引動春心呢</p>
<p>攝影機是伊們最好的良伴，大概每十對的男女中，總有四五對是帶着攝影機的，在樹邊，湖畔；或是艇中；拍幾張充滿了春意的照像，又是多麼使人羨慕啊！</p>
<p>春在那裏？春在玄武湖。</p>
<h3>蓬蒿糰子</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>每逢清明節前後，故鄉—孟河家家戶戶都做蓬蒿糰子上墳祭祖是必備的。自己吃，又以之餽贈親友，這些親友又自然從客地歸來的居多，我每年回里掃墓，有大量收入，第一是外祖母家，一聽見我和爹媽等到家，便立刻打發表妹提着滿滿的一竹籃送來，表妹又是那樣眞摯而精細的人，特地關照；有尖頭的是甜的，芝蔴屑包心。圓形的是鹹的，靑菜和豆腐乾包心，長圓形的是葷的，蔥和肉包心。伊還呌我認定這種吃，因為是伊親手所製。第二要輪着大姨母家了，不過伊家境况不甚好，光是靑菜包的。其賓，故鄉近來用肉包蓬蒿糰子的根本就沒有幾家，鄉下差不多都是經濟人家。</p>
<p>蓬蒿是一種野生的草類，只在清明汎裏做糰子吃，差不多和馬蘭枸𣏌同時萌芽，葉子背面發自的才有用，發靑的味苦澀，不堪下咽，葉背發白的故鄉人又稱之為糯米蓬。從前住在鄉間時，看見媽做過，先把蓬揀凈，棄去根和敗葉，入石臼用杵搥之，到蓬蒿濃瀾為度，然後拌進糯米粉，揑而再揑，使和勻，米粉變成翠綠色，便可做糰子了。我家從前有個石臼，一到清明邊便大忙特忙，這家來搥芝蔴啦，那家來槌蓬蒿啦。往往自家反落在最後一天，別人家都上墳了，我家的蓬蒿糰子還在蒸籠裏，媽却不以忤，至今人都稱伊“好好太太”，也許這就是收獲。而那個石臼却早破了，被叔父利用作為猪食槽。</p>
<p>人和物，一樣的在變遷中，去年猶送蓬蒿糰子給我吃的表妹，今年已做了一惆孩子的母親。而自己一家，更在生活的石盤下，掙扎着。偶爾回憶：孩子時代的事猶隱約浮現在眼前，當柳技葉芽，桐花含苞時，田垠上，池塘邊，風水岸下，便散佈了挑蓬蒿的男女。我也手持小䥥刀，弟弟提個竹籃，跟着別的孩子們挑，媽有時也頭頂靑手巾，親自出來挑蓬蒿，還挖野荸薺給我們吃。而現在伊頭髮已經花白，好幾年來未吃到伊親手製的蓬蒿糰子了。</p>

<p>清明時節，我照例地必買掉而歸，一謁先人之墓。在表面上說來，自然是孝思不匱，然而在實際上。却是醉翁之意不在酒，而是在於墳親家的田園風味之間也。因為在清明時節，正是鄉間嫩韮鮮筍，最為可口之時。當我每年回鄉掃墓時，殷勤的墳親，總是邀去小酌。鄉間所有的，不是鳑魚，也不是牛排，自我幼年時，隨父前往叨擾時起，以迄於現在我自己帶着孩子而前往的三十年中，所嘗的田園風味，可說是一成不變的下述數饌。</p>
<p>㊀韮菜炒百葉。我們在都市之間，購食的韮菜，雖然是儘着挑鮮嫩的買，可是其質的堅韌，當令人興“可利用其纖維以織物”之感。可是在鄉間的韮菜，自田間剪下，洗凈，卽下鍋，所以頗有入口卽化之勢。㊁竹筍拌萵苣。雖然此物，在都市之間，也並不難致，然而筍肉之具有甘味，窩苣之香味四溢，也斷不是都市中人，所得而嘗到的。因為這些甘芳之氣味，惟離土後一二小時之間，方不變劣。若是運入都市，陳諸菜塲，早已是索然無味了。㊂枸𣏌頭。此物為佐酒妙品，都市間的菜塲中，雖也偶有出售，然率多乾枯，或已腐爛，質味已無可取。在鄉間，小兒女摘自雜草叢中，携歸，卽凈洗而下鍋烹煮，不特澀味少，抑且清香撲鼻，殊足使食慾因之而亢進。㊃薺菜。在都市中，我最不愛食薺菜，因其所含澀味太濃，而目略含苦味。但在鄉間所吃的薺菜，雖然用油極儉，然肥嫩鮮美，已足令人朶頤為之一快，而其芳香之氣，殊令人有不忍釋箸之概。——此外，尚有㊄風鷄，㊅臘肉，也都是具有特殊風味的餚饌。雖然田家的烹飪法，夠不上都市人家，然其原來的風味，却並不因調製之簡單，而減却其佳勝。正如一位絕色佳人，雖然脂粉不施，亂頭粗服，仍不損其美麗。</p>
<p>每年清明，回鄉掃墓時，墳親總是以上列六菜為欵待，而更佐以初熟的佳釀。一壁吃喝，一壁鑒賞着窗外的綠柳紅桃，一壁更與老農相對話桑麻，盡醉方已。在下午臨行時，墳親更總是殷勤地欵我以筍絲與草頭，（卽苜蓿），拌和在麵粉之中，而所攤煮的麵衣。雖為素點，然其鮮美清香，可久留於齒頰而不散。</p>
<h3>蘇聯婦女又走上女性美的大道（上）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>人人知道蘇聯的婦女，是跟男子同樣地工作，男女都不許修飾外貌的。但是自從蘇聯實行第二次五年計書之後，當局已改變方針，願意國內的靑年女子都穿着漂亮的服裝，青年男子都把外貌修飾得很整潔。當局曾對農工們說道：“外國人到蘇聯來游歷的，都說蘇聯人民呆板着臉兒，現出緊張的神情，你們可趕快換一副面貌，要使人覺得你們活潑愉快才好。”</p>
<p>當然啦，要一時改換一萬七千萬人的面貌，不是一樁容易的事。但是蘇俄的領袖，是不相信天下有做不到的事情，他們在已往十九年中已恢復世界強國的地位了。倘若你留心看看莫斯科，列寗格勒等處人民的改變的面貌，再看看蘇聯最近的將來的計畫，便禁不住要相信他們是說得到，做得到的。　　去年秋季，蘇俄宣布來年要開設新理髮所七百十五所，共置理髮椅二千八百六十張，從一九一七年八月起一年中，還要添設理髮所一千四百十二所。上年在特別學校訓練的理髮師，共四千九百四十人，本年這種學校畢業的，共有一萬零七百五十人。這些理髮所設傭都很完全，每一所中有一個專員，監視衛生規則的屨行。當局還派了理髮師七千五百人，分赴內地替那些滿面于思的農工們修飾面容。</p>
<p>現在經過莫斯科市上，可以時常看見許多農婦從修容所中走出，把指甲塗上美麗的色彩。那電車中的女賣票員，當她們收你們車資的當兒，大紅色指尖，也照映你們的眼簾。許多工廠中也附設了修指甲處，連餅司也奉了政府的命令，為衛生起見，把指甲修得光光的。全國的婦女幾全把頭髮剪去，修成各種時式，莫斯科有一家最大的百貨商店，免費替女童電燙頭髮，愛時髦的女童，還把頭髮染成各色，大半曾把眉毛拔去，用鉛筆另行畫成長彎的細眉。甚至紅軍中的兵士，頭上灑的生髮水，也覺得香噴噴的。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　白板紅濺寮淡用行淚荻花楓葉獨步半城秋</p>
<p>他說完了這話，兩行眼淚，再也忍不住，就流下來了。而且眼淚流下來的時候，勢子是很猛，他自己要忍住着，反是咽哽起来，不得已，立刻伏在桌沿上，哭得吟吟有聲。友梅先是站着望了他發呆。過了幾分鐘，自已也就落下淚球來。於是掏出手絹，將眼淚擦乾，輕輕撫摸著他的肩膀道：蘭，你不要這樣。好在還有幾個星期的時間，慢慢的想法子罷。你這樣一哭，鬧得樓下人知道了，還以為我到這裏來把什麼話得罪了你呢。我們找一件什麼可樂的事。先快活一下罷。夢蘭這才站直了腰，將手絹擦著眼淚，搖了幾搖頭。友梅不敢提這件事了，只是說了一些同學們的事情。看看天色黃昏，友梅不便同他下樓吃飯，怕是露出了泣容。將他送國器的信紙信封，放在畫包裏。那張字，却摺聲了放在身上。約了過兩天再來看他依然悄悄的走去。次日，友梅就把東西轉送給國器，而且兩人所談的話，也都告訴他了。當時國器在苦惱的臉色上，還勉強帶了一分微笑，却一個字沒有加批評。友梅去後，自己把那信紙信箋展玩了一會，心想，夢蘭到底是個洒脫的女子。他說人生是來找快樂的，不是來找苦惱的．這非常之對。自卽日起，打點着精神，口尋快樂，不想苦惱的事。心裏很苦悶的又過了一個星期。吃過午飯以後，不免在天井裏彷徊。天空裏吚唔有聲，抬頭看時，正是一排雁字，由北向南飛去。心裏猛可的一轉念，是呵！秋深了呵。這還在家裏舌悶些什麼。於是對母親說了一聲，要出城去玩玩，換了一件單簿些的長衣，帶些零錢，獨自人走著。秋日乾燥，約莫有十天上下，不曾落雨因之天空上，僅僅　蕩了幾片白雲。清風迎面吹來，不但不涼，反覺精神為之一爽。於是故意挑著荒涼的小路，向城北走來。當年的南京，繁華在城塏城北只是一些菜園和野竹林子。（一五六）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>又要拆除草棚了</h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>去年的七月間，因為工部局的要拆除滬東一帶的草棚，是曾經演過棚戶以糞帚馬桶抵抗工部局的警捕的悲喜劇過，後來是因為棚戶們一再向各方面請願，更兼他們自身又組織聯合會，以一致的决心，來保護他們的居室，才在“展緩拆遷”這四個字下緩和下來：再以後呢，又聽說有建造平民住宅以及准拆不准蓋的辦法過。</p>
<p>現在則是又看到公共租界二萬五千六百餘棚戶向納稅華人會呈請援助的呈文了。據呈文中所說：“工部局通告限于五月一日前將界內所有草棚悉數拆除”的通告並未收回，平民住宅呢，則據說“該局始則答覆可另建平房住宅，繼又謂蘭路以西，空屋甚多，無另行建築必要”，因此“前欲拆毀之令仍難變更”。</p>
<p>“蘭路以西空屋甚多”，那大概是實情，其實豈祇蘭路以西而已。繁盛區域如南京路一帶，也“空屋甚多”，怕空氣不清潔，滬西一帶的住宅區，空屋也有的是，無奈“民等如有力自賃，租界中廣廈萬間，何待該局之指示，又何至蜷縮草棚，哀求不巳”而“驅民等於租界外後，則遠宿華界邊隅，勢不能更在租界工作，二萬餘人同時失業，窮黎縱不足惜，似亦不免為社會重大問題！”而在“毀室之禍，迫於眉睫”之時，為了爭一個可以“踡縮”的草棚，便也祇有以“身家性命”來作最後準備：“如該局孤行己意，堅不聽從，民等惟有全體集合，束手靜候蹂躪，寧可全罹禍患，不願見任何人之草棚被拆了。</p>
<p>在我們見慣洋房，至少是現在還與草棚無緣的人們看來，草棚之污穢不衛生，有碍觀瞻，那實在是理應拆除的，也不僅是拆除而後巳，為了以壯觀瞻，最好是也造起洋房來，讓他們也“身處崇樓廈屋中”。然而現在呢？蘭路以西的空屋旣無力自賃，以資容身的平民住宅又藉口空屋甚多而打銷，洋房當然更不用說了。而“並僅蔽風雨之片椽而奪之”，難道就眞會他們“提挈婦孺，躑躅街頭”，而我們却“身處祟樓廈屋中”來鑒賞這幅“流民圖”嗎？如果還有一些人心，如果還想這破爛的社會有片刻的安寗，我想總該說個“不”字吧！</p>
<p>五月一日的限期轉眼就到了，我們“寗忍以整飭外觀之故”，在工部局的武裝勒遷之下，眼看着這些勞苦羣衆受“提挈婦孺，躑躅街頭，樓宿無所之苦”乎？還是起而“轉商租界當局，另建平民住宅，在未建築完竣前，不得將草棚拆除”？—而設若袖手旁觀，棚戶與工部局發生衝突，以致造成更嚴重之結果，這責任又該誰負？</p>
<h3>牆</h3>
<p>— 沈家</p>
<p>窗的下面是一條實質的狹弄，隔弄是一所小學校的草塲，因為泥牆過於低矮，草塲就在我的窗下似的。</p>
<p>那所學校大概是個幼稚園吧，我却不大清楚。否則，這草塲總是屬於幼稚生的。那草塲的面積不很寬大，但看慣了弄堂小學的人，他一定要羨慕那學校的經費充足，或者竟由羨慕而嫉妬，“他們太浪費地基不是？”那草塲至少有我住的弄堂半個大呢。</p>
<p>草塲上的設備也頗為週到的，有小型的鞦韆架，小型的滑板，小型的木馬……。塲的一角，用白色的狹木板隔着，我當看見一位年青的女先生把那些天眞活潑的小孩子分成兩隊，用一種歌唱來分勝負。這種遊戲，孩子們似乎也最歡迎的，可是沒有了先生，他們就不知道誰勝誰負的。正彷彿孩子們喜歡賭博一樣，却不知道賭的是那一種牌。而我，至今還沒有曉得那遊戲是什麼名稱。</p>
<p>當我每天早上讀報的時候，草塲上已經充滿了笑聲，那些孩子都願意在上課之前很早到學校。有些更小的孩子都有阿媽陪伴着，看起來走路都有些搖搖欲墜的樣子，而喜歡到草塲上來遊玩却是一樣的。害得他們的家長，命阿媽帶了餅乾來做早點。自然，像他們那樣幼小的年齡，又生長在一個有錢的家庭裏，進幼稚園讀書已經是一種最好的遊戲了；而還有草塲，還有年青的女先生教他們唱歌，學校眞是太好的塲所啊！</p>
<p>自己小時候就沒有受過這種教育，私塾裏的孩子都是呌人討厭得不敢相信，也從沒有一個孩子像孩子腔的。讀書就祇有讀書，唱歌，遊戲，要到散學後才偷偷地找個靜僻的所在玩一會。而總是那些“金鷄呌，銀鷄呌，八哥生蛋啥人要？”和“騎白馬”，捉迷藏等老套兒。沒有三五分鐘，一個個的溜走了。我們做孩子時代，都是喜歡家的。</p>
<p>每天對着草塲觀望，似乎也有一種嫉妬從心底裏滋長起來，我們的孩子時代為什麼沒有那種幸福的幼稚園呢？於是我望着我的五歲的孩子，他常常告訴他媽，說學校裏的先生要他去讀書，也給餅乾他吃，更學會了“先生早！小朋友早！”那有禮貌的見面禮，妻的意思，五歲的孩子也應該送幼稚園了，關在家裏，會把他悶得“婆婆媽媽”的。把自己的孩子打扮得漂亮點，讓他享一份童年的幸福，每一個做父母的幾乎都有那樣的心腸。那些草塲上的孩子，不是夠討人喜歡嗎？所以妻每次提起，我也每</p>

<p>次答應，不過推諉着過一個學期再説。這不兑現的支票對於孩子的用處却很大，他也像我一樣對着窗望草塲，看得高興的時候，會脱口學着我的話“下學期讀書去”。</p>
<p>於是我也順口答他：“下學期讀書去”。</p>
<p>隨手關上了窗，讓那草塲隔離在短牆之外。</p>
<h3>浮莊一夜</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>船重划過小金山時，見伸在水中的，釣魚臺的方亭上，已滿是水了。我們試着向亭子撑去，竟將船撑到亭子中央，船夫要在這里避雨，因為船上已裝了很多的水了。雨似乎愈下愈大，對面的白塔頂上的雲最黑，雷電陸續從那里出來，在這里獃了好久，船夫為我說了一段船娘銀針殉情的故事：</p>
<p>銀針，是北門外一個撑船的姑娘，為了牠的爹媽逼她跟城里一個錢商作妾，她便和她的情夫，一個青年莊稼漢，雙雙地在“柳家汪”投水死了。</p>
<p>躲雨慚不耐煩，便教船夫將我送到離此不遠的“浮莊”，這是一個朋友的別墅，心想：雨縱然到晚不住，便任這里住一宵也好。</p>
<p>主人不在別墅，幸而看園子的張大認識我，當晚當眞宿在“浮莊”了。</p>
<p>所住的房子，一面有廊，廊外就是湖，因為太近水，蚊子極多，雖有蚊帳，還是被吵得不能睡。主人又不曾在這間屋子藏書，沒有什麼可供消遣，張大送來的煤油燈，索興不去點它，只放下蚊帳，端坐床上，聽聽廊外荷葉上的雨聲。幸而雨愈下愈小，漸漸由小至無，我探頭看窗外，見薄雲如飛，朦朦朧朧透着半規月，知道雨已经住了。出來到廊上，湖里竟已映着幾點星光，近廊處有樹滴水，顯得夜很靜。沿着廊走上座假山，看對岸山寺中還閃着燈光。</p>
<p>立了好一會才回屋，走到窗外時，聽見屋中彷彿有人，初以為是來了小偷兒，便放重腳步走去。忽然有一男一女，匆匆跑出，朦朦中辨得出女人穿着藍色褂褲，頭上梳辮，是年紀很青的鄉下姑娘。男人也年青，只穿一件背褡，光着兩臂，他們慌慌張張，從廊前石坡走下去，下面有一雙小船，他們蕩着走了。我呆了半晌，忽然想起那“柳家汪”的故事，不覺毛骨聳然，趕緊回到屋內，點上燈，我打開帳子時，見褥單被弄得很不舒整了。我恍然大悟，不覺笑了。這應該是常常來此幽會的一對情人，也許每夜都來也說不定，主人大概雖在此設榻，而並不常來，有了他們倆的借用才使這床帳不為處設。然而我未免抱了很大的歉意。這一對情人的面貌，當時未能看清，但想像起來，都是很可愛的樣子，我想像他們每夜怎樣坐着船來去，便非常羨慕這水鄉的風趣了。</p>
<h3>晨</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>推開窗子，便瞧見幾株楊樹和槐樹，孤另另地站在那裏。誰家的庭院現在巳經冷落荒蕪了。楊樹的高大軀幹，彷彿要攢進蔚藍的天空裏去，槐樹却不是那樣，身子有點彎曲，撑着大的傘蓋。正是冬天逝去初春剛來的時侯，綠油油的枝葉已密密地長起來，陽光瀉下明輝．便滲透下稀疏的陰影，落在叢生着碧綠細草上，畫出一縷縷的斑紋，星星點點的野花，紫色的，白色的，從葺草中探出姣小玲瓏的臉兒。</p>
<p>更覺得好玩的便是在清晨，朦朦朧朧地烟霧，罩住了幾株樹，辨不清它們的面目是什麼樣兒，曉風清冷的搖曳着枝葉，發出低微的響音，如果陽光剛好斜射過來的時候，也許風勢稍煞了，那麼憑在窗上，瞌上眼也好，睜着眼也好，默默地諦聽着，沒有白天裏鼎沸的嘈雜聲，祇有一羣跟着春天同來到這裏的小鳥兒，啾啾唧唧的呌着。</p>
<p>傾耳細聽，慢慢的領悟着聒碎奧妙的歌聲，會讓你的心情，淡淡的浸在這神密的詩意般的境界裏去。</p>
<p>這時，隨着風飄來了一陣陣的野花的香味，襲進鼻孔裏來直沁到心裏，望着草地上，跳躍的鳥兒，忽而飛起，忽而落地，三三兩兩地唱着迎春歌，伶俐的躱在枝葉上，興高彩烈的吵鬧着，會呌你覺得什麼都有詩的意味，你入神的聽，漸漸把思想凝結到一個夢幻的世界去，你會記憶起過去曾經披讀過的小說裏片斷的瑣碎的情景，說不定在你腦子裏描繪出故事中的主人翁，怎樣在失敗中豁然得着了他所需要的安慰，或者構思出丈夫遠征的婦人，獨自默坐在深幽的閨房裏，聽見了小鳥的呌聲，驀然引起了撩亂的懷戀心緒………。</p>
<p>如果你喜愛晨光的清新，靜謐的散步在樹林裏，那麼牠們的啼聲，使你忘了一切，人事的鄙俗，渺茫，依然那麼盲目的扮演着，你會感到飄浮出宇宙之外的快樂。</p>
<p>假如你在濃睡中，牠們悄悄地走在你的屋簷前來，逗弄你，唱起活潑的曲子，把你輕輕地喚醒，你不會憎惡牠們的多事，只是慵懶的躺着，咀嚼着甜夢遺留下的滋味，或許追索着往事的美妙的幻影，也許津津有味的憧憬着自己的未來。</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Discusses Travel Impressions</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived in Nanjing on the 9th. On the 11th, he met with reporters from the Central News Agency and told them that he had traveled to the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Fujian, where he witnessed the Chinese people's diligence in working and their determination to develop economic resources. He expressed his admiration for the progress of highways, railways, commercial ports, and industries along the way.  He said that the area along the Yuehan Railway is extremely rich in products, and the future development is limitless. The position of Guangdong province is particularly important.  He said that his talks with the Guangdong provincial authorities mainly concerned the issue of economic cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, so as to make the economic relationship between the two places closer in the future, with absolutely no political overtones involved.  He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the warm hospitality of local authorities and dignitaries along the way and extended his thanks.  He found the construction of the Yuehan Railway to be arduous and magnificent, the scenery excellent, and the locomotive materials partly manufactured by his country, which he found particularly interesting.  He added that he believed he was the first foreign envoy to China to travel this route. After the British Ambassador arrived in Hong Kong, his wife and two daughters came from Shanghai to greet him. They returned to Shanghai by the same ship on the 8th and arrived in Nanjing on the 9th.

<h3>Issue of Tax-Free Foreign Rice Entering Guangdong</h3>
<p>Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau Sends Personnel to Guangdong to Agree on Five Measures and Telegraphed the Ministry for Instructions; Hubei Organizations Jointly Telegraph to Request Prevention</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Ministry of Finance's Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau sent Shen Guoqi to Guangdong on the 10th to discuss the issue of tax-free foreign rice entering Guangdong. Shen and the headquarters and customs agreed on five measures, which Yu and Shen jointly telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. In general, since the Civil Food Regulation Committee is not responsible for issuing permits, the Guangdong Customs will be responsible for handling the matter. The Guangdong customs will use the population of their respective jurisdictions as the standard for importing rice, dividing the period from April 1 to August 30 into four phases for rice import. Hong Kong rice merchants have decided to hold a large-scale petition when Wu Tiecheng arrives in Hong Kong because the rice they have in stock cannot be transported to the province. They have received Wu's reply en route, stating that he will schedule a meeting after arriving in Hong Kong. (11th special dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce, and various organizations jointly telegraphed the central government on the 11th to request the prevention of tax-free imports of foreign rice. The original telegram read: To Wang, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, Zou, Acting Minister of Finance, and Wu Jun, Minister of Industry: Last year's bumper harvest in Central China and the gradual recovery of the bankrupt rural areas have brought slight prosperity to the provinces. Recently, the tax-free import of foreign rice to Guangdong has caused public outcry. Everyone believes that our country is based on agriculture, and all industries and businesses rely on agriculture, so we should conduct in-depth research. We respectfully present the following confirmed information for consideration: (1) The surplus grain in the four provinces is sufficient to meet the needs of Guangdong Province. According to the latest accurate estimates, Hunan has 2.5 million dan of rice in storage, Hubei has 2 million dan of rice in storage, Jiangxi has 2 million dan of rice in storage, and Anhui has 2.5 million dan of rice in storage. There are still reserves in the countryside. Furthermore, according to the current rice demand in Guangdong Province, there is actually only a shortage of 2 million bags. The telegram from various organizations in Changsha on the 8th has already proven this. Not only is there more than enough, but even in the past, when the rice shortage was most severe and transportation was extremely difficult, there was no shortage. With smooth railways, there will be no need to worry about shortages. (2) Guangdong Province's problem is not a rice shortage but high rice prices, due to the low value of silver coins and the past transportation obstacles. In addition, the provinces have already transported 1.8 million bags of domestic rice to Guangdong in January, February, and March, totaling 2.2 million dan at market weight, and market prices are gradually stabilizing. In the future, as long as domestic rice is supplied steadily and the currency system is reorganized, increasing the import of foreign rice is not necessary. The tax-free import of foreign rice will lead to the decline of farmers and merchants, and the impact will be significant. The central government has a broad and far-sighted perspective and will surely see the truth. We humbly request that you comply with public opinion, sympathize with the suffering of the people, and resolutely revoke the order to care for farmers and merchants and consolidate the foundation of the country. The Hubei Provincial Federation of Commerce, leading the chambers of commerce of all counties in the province, the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce, leading all trade associations in the city, the Wuchang Chamber of Commerce, the Hanyang Chamber of Commerce, and the agricultural associations of all districts in Hankou jointly kowtow.

Cheng left Nanjing for Shanghai on the morning of the 11th to wait for transportation south. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Reorganizes Chicago Bank Loan</h3>
<p>Totaling US$5.5 Million; Five Reorganization Measures Approved</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance's announcement on the reorganization of the Chicago Bank loan stated: "An investigation has revealed that the bonds of the Republic of China, namely the Chicago Bank loan, totaled US$5.5 million. The reorganization measures have been approved as follows: (1) Interest: From November 1, 1936, interest will be calculated at an annual rate of 2.5% for three years. From November 1, 1939, interest will be calculated at an annual rate of 5%. Interest will be paid twice a year, on May 1 and November 1. (2) (A) 1/5 of the accumulated interest from May 1, 1921, to November 1, 1936, calculated at the original contract rate of annual simple interest. (B) 1/5 of the difference between the 2.5% interest payable from November 1, 1936, to November 1, 1939, and the 5% interest payable thereafter. Both of the above items will be issued as non-interest-bearing scrip. (3) Redemption of bonds and payment of scrip will begin on November 1, 1942, according to the following proportions: 5% annually in 1942 and 1943, 6% annually in 1944 and 1945, 7% annually in 1946 and 1947, 8% annually in 1948 and 1949, 9% annually in 1950 and 1951, and 10% annually from 1952 to 1954. The government may, with reasonable notice, increase the amount of redemption at any redemption period without additional cost. These bonds will be redeemed by the paying agency through a lottery held each year in August prior to the redemption period. (4) Redemption and interest payments will be disbursed from the surplus of salt revenue. The surplus of salt revenue after April 12, 1937, will be used as collateral, except for the funds already designated as collateral before that date. (5) After accepting the above measures, bondholders should present their bonds to receive new interest coupons, and this method should be printed on one end of the new interest coupons. Until the various provisions of this method come into effect, all provisions of the original contract will remain valid. The interest payable on May 1 of this year can be claimed by cutting off the last unpaid interest coupon on the bond before the new interest coupons are printed." (National News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Jinpu Railway's Domestic and Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Nine-tenths of the total Jinpu Railway's reorganization of foreign debt, domestic debt, and material debt has been resolved. The foreign debt portion, including the original British and German continued loans and German advances, amounted to approximately £11.8 million by the end of last year, equivalent to over 199 million yuan in national currency. The reorganization measures for the original British and German continued loans were drafted last year to repay the loans annually. The reorganization measures for the German advances have also been resolved recently. The important terms are: (1) The total amount of principal and interest of all advances, based on the figures jointly verified by both parties as of June 30 last year, is £900,000, which will be taken as the amount as of October 1, 1936. (2) All unpaid interest from June 30, 1936, to October 1, 1936, will be waived, and no interest will be charged for the next three years. (3) From October 1, 1936, the railway will repay £100,000 of principal within three years, divided equally over the three years. (4) From October 1, 1939, interest will be charged at an annual rate of 3% on the remaining £800,000. (5) From October 1, 1939, the railway will allocate £50,000 annually to a sinking fund to repay the remaining advances. Of the above two loans, £187,400 should be paid in 1937. In addition to the £154,100 of original British and German continued loans that should be paid, which are submitted monthly to the British and German Debt Fund Management Committee for disbursement, the £33,300 of advances that should be paid are also paid by the railway bureau to the committee for transfer. The domestic debt portion that was reorganized by the end of last year included the 5% Zhongxing Company bond for purchasing vehicles and employee arrears. The vehicle debt banking syndicate debt was also resolved last month. Only the bank loans have not been fully resolved. As for the material debt portion, in addition to the British merchants Sanjiu, Dachang, Mobil, and Texaco, the remaining material prices owed to Chinese and foreign merchants have also begun to be paid. A small number of merchants who have not accepted are still being resolved. (11th special dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Horrors of Future Warfare (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>New Scientific Methods of Killing</p>
<p>In the next great war, will our youth be burned to ashes by "death rays"? Will they be shattered to pieces by "sound wave vibration machines"? Or will they be annihilated by "deadly centrifugal force machines"? Can light be shot into the sky to destroy airplanes? Will flying submarines, flying tanks, sky torpedoes, and stratospheric bombers appear? Can an "invisible smoke" be used to suffocate airplane engines, causing them to crash to the ground? Will soldiers wear clothes made of glass, or even iron cages, to resist "death rays"? Which of these methods can be used? Which are still in the experimental stage?</p>
<p>These important questions have been answered one by one in a book co-authored by two Germans living abroad, one a researcher in political science and the other an engineer. According to the two authors: "The German authorities are currently promoting to the people that future wars will be won entirely by relying on newly invented weapons with extremely terrifying destructive power. Germany will definitely celebrate victory within a few days after the outbreak of hostilities. These newly invented weapons are currently kept secret, and no foreign country knows about them, so the German people do not need to be afraid of war, nor do they need to worry about defeat; they can rest easy." This propaganda movement, aided by news about mysterious new weapons published in world newspapers, makes it even more appealing.</p>
<p>Most of these discussions are unconscious. All countries investigate the development of new weapons by other countries in detail. The international arms industry is not concerned with military secrets. The latest scientific inventions are described in detail in the technical magazines of various countries. Various new devices are registered with the Patent Office. International patent agencies are willing to provide new weapons to anyone willing to pay. Finally, one thing must be remembered: if a new weapon fails during military exercises, it will encounter great danger. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to keep large-scale trials secret. Therefore, it is unlikely that any country will be able to exclusively enjoy the benefits of a new weapon for a long time. Moreover, today all countries use various intelligence agencies to investigate the internal affairs of other countries. If someone invents a new weapon for killing, you can be sure that the news will spread all over the world before long.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that National Socialist Germany will definitely not make a surprising move next year. But there is no need for a surprising move, because the weapons that are already known, especially those developed after 1930, are already powerful enough. The only question that remains to be answered is whether the old-fashioned military hardware—"improved" machine guns, cannons, bursting shells, bombs, etc.—are not as effective as the new ones and are more expensive?</p>
<p>Great efforts have been made to apply various "lights" to warfare. The general public refers to all kinds of "lights" as "death rays." However, the scientific principles contained in these various "lights" and their uses are very different. There are about a dozen types of "light," each with its own use. The most praised is the one that is expected to destroy the engines in airplanes and prevent them from flying. It is said that a town is surrounded on all sides by this "invisible light," so airplanes cannot fly over this "death line." Unfortunately, most of this is still fantasy. This "light" can only be broadcast on the ground, so it can only target low-flying airplanes and cars, and the range is still very limited. In addition, it is very simple to protect the engine using the current method of protecting radio machinery to resist this "light." Although the newspaper said that the two principles of Marconi and Tesla were combined in this defensive weapon, it has not yet become a reality.</p>
<p>It is said that there are several other types of "light" that can damage the heads of enemy soldiers, disperse their blood, or scorch their bodies. These three layers require three different types of "light." At short distances, these lights have proven to be so powerful that they can even destroy oxygen, but these "lights" cannot reach far, and a cage made of iron or steel can capture them and make them lose their effectiveness.</p>
<p>There is also a type of "lead light" that can reach almost the speed of ordinary light, which is currently being tested. This type of light is still elastic, and wearing clothes made of glass can protect the whole body. This does not mean that soldiers have to hide in glass cages. There is now a material woven from glass fibers that is washable and durable. Czech glass factories have manufactured it in large quantities and sold it widely in South America, making scarves for women that are dazzling.</p>
<p>What is more practical now is to use radio to control ships from afar. This technology has been developing for a long time. All airplanes, ships, and tanks can be operated remotely by radio without human intervention. The first time this tactic was tested at sea was as early as 1899. Since then, the great powers have used these "ghost ships" in every naval exercise. They can obey various commands, such as sailing in any direction, using searchlights, launching torpedoes, etc.</p>
<p>Although larger ships cannot be controlled in this way, smaller ships can certainly be controlled at will. These ships can be used to lay mines or be loaded with bombs and rammed into any target. Since this method can be used at sea, aircraft carriers can also carry many unmanned airplanes to any desired location, and then make the airplanes rise, fly dozens of miles away, and land on the ground or on enemy ships. Those airplanes can also be made to launch torpedoes, etc.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to control tanks by radio because they travel on uneven ground, and the vibrations will prevent the complex guidance mechanisms from carrying out orders.</p>
<p>Because the guidance mechanisms are not always reliable and because the targets can suddenly change, the effectiveness of these "ghost ships" and "ghost airplanes" is limited. In addition, the guidance mechanisms are very expensive and easily destroyed. Therefore, several major countries feel that using people is both cheaper and more reliable. The suicide squads invented by the Japanese and Italian navies are the most terrifying tactic using human power. The Japanese method is to have a volunteer soldier—of course, there are many candidates—lie in the middle of a mine. He can adjust the direction in the torpedo very accurately. He can severely damage or sink an enemy ship, sacrificing his personal life to exchange for the lives of hundreds of people. The Italian mosquito fleet also has this suicide squad. In the Abyssinian War, they attempted to use an airplane suicide squad to resist the British army if the British army intervened in the Italian-Abyssinian War. Sky torpedoes are a very dangerous weapon, and their direction is also guided from afar. In 1922, according to a report by US General Mitchell, he launched three sky torpedoes from Garden City, Long Island, to Trenton, New Jersey, 110 kilometers away, with absolute accuracy. Since then, it has been greatly improved. This type of torpedo can contain several bombs, which can be dropped at various isolated times, or the torpedo itself can be a bomb, falling in dangerous locations according to the guided direction.</p>
<p>Another type of "light" can cause land mines, surface mines, and other explosives to detonate. There is also a type of light called "blind light," whose luminous power is thousands of times stronger than the lights on a car's head. Soldiers who touch this light will at least temporarily be blinded and unable to see. In contrast, there is an invisible light that is used to search for airplanes and warships at night. Although ordinary searchlights are useful, they are also harmful, because while illuminating the sky to search for enemy planes, they illuminate the entire area, making it a target for enemy bombardment. The newly invented "light" can only be seen by people wearing special glasses. The US fleet used this method during exercises off the coast of Jersey in 1935, with excellent results.</p>

<h3>Improvement of Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying met with Japanese journalists in Nanjing on the 10th and expressed his views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. He said that in order to "improve Sino-Japanese relations, three spirits must be possessed: first, mutual benefit; second, mutual trust; and third, mutual assistance." This view and the foreign policy reported by Foreign Minister Wang in Beijing on the 5th of this month, which advocated that economic cooperation must be based on mutual benefit and equality, have a common point. Economic mutual benefit and equality are the prerequisite for so-called friendship, so-called cooperation, and so-called "joint efforts." Under this principle, we hope to increase mutual relations with other countries, and if other countries want to increase mutual relations with us, we also hope that they will first consider this condition. Otherwise, all so-called friendship, so-called cooperation, and so-called "joint efforts" are either diplomatic rhetoric or deceitful talk.</p>
<p>We have heard the call for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations for a long time, but we have not seen any facts that can improve Sino-Japanese relations. What we have seen is that iron hooves run rampant and invade our territory, and vagrant smugglers infringe on our customs rights. If the positions were reversed, who could bear this? It can be said that we have done our best to be patient. But what about the other party? Speaking of this, we want to ask the other party to reflect on it. It is true that the recent arguments of people in and out of the Japanese government are somewhat different from the past. After the Japanese investigation team returned to China, Kodama once said that Japan must severely correct its past diplomatic course towards China and also said that "Japan's economic development, whether in the development of production or the expansion of business, fundamentally requires the maintenance of friendly relations between China and Japan. So far, although there may be unreasonable actions on the Chinese side, we also have shortcomings… Therefore, both sides must take into account each other's position, and especially hope that the Japanese side will change its previous feelings towards China." It seems that the heads of the Japanese economic and political circles have seen this point and are making an effort to be patient and practice the principle of "do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you." However, the facts may not be entirely true. While we are hearing the heads of the economic and political circles chanting about taking into account the interests of both sides, we are also hearing news about "adopting a tough policy towards North China is absolutely necessary." Such contradictions may be due to the fact that Japan's foreign policy has not reached the level of "unitary goodness" that our former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun called for. However, the "unitary goodness" of Japan's foreign policy can never be achieved by the current political leaders of Japan who issue orders from multiple sources. We know that although the Japanese diplomatic authorities have been chanting friendship, the heads of the Japanese garrison in China are still acting recklessly as before. Mutual benefit cannot be achieved, mutual trust cannot be talked about, and where can mutual assistance be mentioned?</p>
<p>Therefore, the key to improving Sino-Japanese relations lies not in us but in them. We want to see the performance of the facts to see whether the other party has sincerity in mutual benefit, mutual trust, and mutual assistance. And how to promote the other party's sincerity still depends on our resolute struggle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Elaborates on the New Cabinet's Program</h3>
<p>Administrative Agencies Determined to Implement Reforms. Foreign Policy Seeks National Unity. Strengthen Military Preparedness to Deal with Emergencies.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi gave a speech on the evening of the 10th regarding the current cabinet's eight major policies. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Renewal of Culture and Education: Regarding the renewal of culture and education, the Teaching Renewal Review Committee is already studying various issues. If these issues are concretized, most of the goals can be achieved. However, in order to thoroughly study the national identity concept in all aspects of education, politics, and administration, it is planned to establish a new review body within the cabinet.</p>
<p>▲Reform of Administrative Agencies: Regarding the establishment of a new central aviation agency, it is extremely necessary to popularize aviation ideas and strive to develop the aviation industry today. There is currently a proposal to make this new agency an independent ministry, but it has not yet been determined. As for the intention to revise the official system, it is to obtain capable talents, but the specific issues have not yet been considered.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Policy of National Unity: Foreign policy issues are the same as military affairs. In practice, it is inconvenient to discuss the content in detail, but in terms of spirit, it is necessary to unify the cabinet's thinking and gradually realize it concretely in order to achieve a foreign policy of national unity. In short, foreign policy must be fair and should not become a regressive or submissive foreign policy.</p>
<p>▲Substantial Strengthening of National Defense: The meaning of strengthening national defense is not to actively carry out certain actions, but to strengthen one's own attitude in preparation for the occurrence of an emergency. The preparation for national mobilization has the same spirit.</p>
<p>▲Other Policies: Other policies have been stated in the program declaration. The Prime Minister also mentioned countermeasures for the general election and the issue of new parties, generally saying that political parties should be aware, operate national politics, and open up this difficult situation. The government should not have abnormal interference that hinders the election from being rectified. As for the issue of new parties, the world is rumored that I intend to organize a new party, but this is not the fact. I only hope that the political parties will improve. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 10th, the government decided on eight major policies and announced them at home and abroad. Regarding the implementation of these policies, Prime Minister Hayashi paid special attention to the issue of streamlining and improving administrative agencies and was eager to establish a Cabinet Planning Bureau and establish a central aviation administration agency. According to Prime Minister Hayashi's policy, the Planning Bureau should be the central hub of the Cabinet, establish contact with various ministries, and concretize the eight major policies. This Planning Bureau should be the central agency. It is reported that the Prime Minister is determined to realize it before the special Diet session.</p>
<p>Regarding the central aviation administrative agency, there are currently three proposals within the cabinet: an aviation ministry, an aviation academy, and an aviation office. However, Prime Minister Hayashi believes that under the current state of Japan's aviation industry, in order to develop the aviation industry, conduct fundamental research on aviation technology, and even actively guide civil aviation, it is necessary to establish an aviation ministry.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the so-called issue of abolishing and merging ministries, which is related to the issue of administrative agencies, the Prime Minister believes that at a time when social conditions are becoming increasingly complex, ministries and departments really need to be increased due to administrative technology and other reasons. In short, the Prime Minister believes that the number of ministries is not the question, but the cabinet itself should maintain a strong unity. Therefore, he seems to have completely disregarded the talk of abolishing and merging ministries for the purpose of reducing ministries and departments. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Army Minister Sugiyama Emphasizes Establishment of Aviation Ministry</h3>
<p>Odawara: Army Minister Sugiyama boarded a train to Kansai on the evening of the 10th. In the train, he told reporters that among the policies decided at the cabinet meeting on the 10th, the most noteworthy are the establishment of a central aviation agency and the thorough implementation of social policies. The government plans to establish a powerful central aviation agency, but the specific content is still to be decided by the army, navy, and Ministry of Communications. Among the social policies, the military is most concerned about the issue of national fitness. Therefore, it will actively support the implementation of the National Health Insurance Law. The Military Aircraft Protection Law, the Iron Policy, the Fuel Policy, etc., which are related to the army, are already prepared to be submitted to the special Diet session. In short, this time the political program has been decided, and it is unknown how the world will criticize it, but it can prove that the entire cabinet is working together, with the military and civilians cooperating, towards the goal of perfect national defense, transcending the broad or narrow sense of national defense. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Yuki Considers Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>Start with Coal and Iron First</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Finance Minister Yuki issued a statement on the current situation on the 11th, saying that the new cabinet's policy has price countermeasures. Given the current situation of rising prices, it is necessary to use administrative means or ministerial orders to set up measures to seek emergency countermeasures. If necessary, a bill to restrict prices may be submitted to the special Diet session. For this purpose, it is most necessary to start by suppressing the market prices of iron or coal. Regarding iron, there is already an emergency imperial edict to exempt it from tariffs. Currently, the Privy Council is consulting on the amendment to the Customs Proximity Law and export control taxes. If there is a need for further review, it may not be submitted to the special Diet session but wait until the opening of the next ordinary Diet session before submitting it. The issue of filling the vacancies of cabinet members is currently being considered by the government. If it is the same as the previous cabinet, with each political party appointing cabinet members, it is meaningless. Therefore, a government and a party should be organized, and new cabinet members should be taken from this party. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Views of Japanese Industry</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The industrial sector holds the following views on the new policies of the Hayashi Cabinet. The political program includes a provision for carrying out national mobilization, which can be interpreted as the government intending to move towards a quasi-wartime economic situation in order to carry out this preparation. Therefore, it makes people wonder whether the government is strengthening the economic policies of national control, which makes people feel a sense of anxiety. However, the industrial sector expressed sympathy for the government's policy of attempting to revitalize various industries and expand productivity. (Domei dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister to the Netherlands Kushima Inspects the Dutch East Indies and Reports</h3>
<p>Frankly Advises Sato on Southern Expansion Policy, Saying that Economic Development Holds Unlimited Hope</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Minister to the Netherlands Kushima went to the Dutch East Indies archipelago for an inspection tour lasting one month. He has now returned to the country and arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 11th. As a result of this trip, the minister deeply felt that the so-called southern expansion policy has given the Dutch East Indies unnecessary suspicion. Therefore, when he made an inspection report to Foreign Minister Sato, he frankly advised that the key point of developing the South Seas lies in proving in fact that Japan's South Seas policy is a peaceful attempt. Regarding the current situation in the Dutch East Indies, the minister made the following statement:</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies archipelago, blessed by the sea and sunlight, has inexhaustible resources. After investigation, it is known that the existing resources are certain, and there is plenty of room for creating new businesses. Therefore, it is a vast new world for the Japanese to go and operate. I have met with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and the Economic Minister, as well as people from all walks of life in the area. Their attitude towards Japan is very kind and not as hostile to Japan as imagined in the country. The Governor-General also expressed congratulations on the establishment of the Japan-Dutch agreement and hopes that in the future, the development of commerce and trade and the exchanges of merchants between the two countries will further increase mutual understanding between the two countries. Furthermore, due to the recovery of the economy and the increase in the purchasing power of scholars, there is indeed unlimited hope for the southern sales of Japanese goods. The area does have considerable suspicion about Japan's southern expansion theory, because they feel that merely chanting peaceful economic development without proving it with facts is quite suspicious. Therefore, it is really necessary for Japanese enterprises to express the spirit of peace in fact in the future. In addition, even for enterprises that need basic preparation, they should not be monopolized by the Japanese alone, but cooperate with the Dutch. Then, except for national defense and other businesses that have special relations, the development of businesses will benefit both Japan and the Netherlands, and the Dutch East Indies will definitely agree. We should avoid using the word "southern development" in a boastful way and simply give them misunderstandings. When establishing Japan's policy towards the Dutch East Indies, we must carefully consider its underlying relationship. In other words, if we look at it with a global perspective, then peaceful economic expansion is not impossible. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Textile Conference</h3>
<p>Our Representative Expresses Views</p>
<p>Without the Abolition of Extraterritoriality, Reducing Working Hours is Just Empty Talk</p>
<p>[Washington] At the International Textile Conference today, the representative of the French government, Picuna, claimed that if countries with backward labor standards cannot shorten working hours, then their goods may be rejected by other countries. The Dutch representative also expressed the same view. Although his words referred to China and Japan, most of them were directed at Japan. The Chinese representative said that without the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, all discussions about reducing working hours are just empty talk, because even if international treaties are concluded, you cannot prohibit factories in the concessions from violating the treaties.

<h3>Guam Delegation Petitions the United States</h3>
<p>Grant US Citizenship. US Navy Chief Disagrees</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, a delegation from Guam asked the Senate Territorial Committee to grant US citizenship to the residents of Guam. Navy Chief Swanson sent a letter to the committee opposing this proposal, saying that the international relations in the Far East are very complicated, all treaties are not very reliable, and the United States is preparing to withdraw from the Philippines. Therefore, it is not appropriate to change the status of the residents of Guam or change the way the island is managed at this time. Guam representative Bautro replied that the island has nothing to do with the political situation in the Far East and that its residents have long been loyal to the United States. Therefore, granting them citizenship can not only satisfy their hopes but also unite the island with the motherland. (Guomin News dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>[Paris] The newly appointed commander of the French Far East Fleet, Vice Admiral Le Bigot, is about to depart for the Far East to take up his post.

<h3>British Five-Year Military Strengthening Plan</h3>
<p>Expected to be Completed on Schedule - Statement by the Minister for Coordination of Defence</p>
<p>[London] British Minister for Coordination of Defence, Sir Thomas Inskip, stated last night that the British five-year military strengthening plan is expected to be completed within the scheduled time. It is currently in full swing and has already achieved great and significant results. The stock of shells is gradually increasing. The necessary supply of fuel required by the navy has been arranged in advance by the Admiralty. Large and small artillery pieces, aircraft engines, and various scientific instruments are now being delivered in large quantities by the manufacturers. As for the news reports stating that Britain has less than half a month's supply of wheat and flour, this is inaccurate. There is currently a three-month supply of food for the population. Speaking of the future of the world, Britain today, when the League of Nations has not fully developed as we hoped, holds the greatest power to pacify the world. The calmness of Britain's demeanor and the strength of its spirit have never been greater than they are today. In this critical period in world history, what gives the government special strength is the unity of the entire people. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Indicates Imminent Retirement</h3>
<p>Energy Declining - Decides to Give Way to Worthier Successors</p>
<p>[London] At a meeting of the Worcestershire Unionist Association held in Bewdley today, Prime Minister Baldwin mentioned his imminent retirement. This was Baldwin's first such indication, and the audience was deeply moved. Baldwin then recounted the heavy burden of his office, stating that for the sake of the country and all related parties, he had decided to retire in favor of worthier successors, as he had dedicated his prime to the nation and now has less confidence in the future. He further stated that the mental strain of being Prime Minister of Great Britain is unbearable even for the strongest, and although he feels his judgment is no less sharp than in his prime, his energy is declining and he cannot continue. Baldwin's speech was mostly a recollection of the past, but he spared no effort in attacking the two major ideologies of Communism and Fascism, stating that neither could solve Britain's constitutional problems, and both ideologies are extremely dangerous because what is achieved by force must be permanently guaranteed by force in order to continue to exist.

<h3>Northwest Frontier Tribesmen Fiercely Fight British Troops</h3>
<p>Nearly Thirty Casualties on Both Sides</p>
<p>New Delhi - Yesterday, British forces on the Northwest Frontier clashed fiercely again with local tribesmen. The British side suffered six dead and five wounded. It is reported that the total number of casualties on both sides was approximately twenty-five dead and four wounded. It is also reported that a British supply convoy was attacked by tribesmen of the Zakka Khel tribe on the way from Miranshah to Wana, led by the radical Muslim Huang Niya Gai Er. The British escort consisted of three armored vehicles and transport trucks carrying one hundred and twenty-five infantrymen, accompanied by one aircraft. When the convoy was attacked, the infantrymen immediately jumped off the trucks to fight back. Later, reinforcements from various British units arrived, and the two sides fought fiercely throughout the day. The aircraft was hit by rifle fire and had to make a forced landing, but the crew was unharmed. All supply vehicles have now safely reached Wana or have returned to Miranshah.

<h3>Capital Again Bombed</h3>
<p>Madrid - Nationalist forces in the suburbs launched a heavy artillery bombardment of the capital at 10:45 this morning. As of the time of dispatch, about fifteen shells had hit the city, striking several houses near a large building. As a result, there were no pedestrians on the nearby streets, and residents in the building took refuge in the cellars. The shelling gradually stopped at noon, and there has been no artillery fire in the capital for fifteen minutes now. Presumably, the Nationalist forces have stopped shelling. According to a post-incident investigation, the Gravia district suffered the heaviest losses in this morning's shelling. The walls of a certain house were quite thick, but the front balcony had collapsed, and the walls were riddled with bullet holes. A car parked on the street was also destroyed. Although there were no passengers in the car, two women walking on the street were hit by stray bullets and seriously injured. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Purge in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Three Hundred Political Police Officers Arrested</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the arrest of the former Soviet People's Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs, former chief of the political police Yagoda, the correspondent for the Petit Parisien in Moscow stated that "this is a large-scale purge, and the truth will surely come to light. The Soviet authorities have publicly stated that three hundred political police officers have been arrested. Regarding the extensive activities of German spies in Soviet territory, the information previously obtained by Communist Party General Secretary Stalin was not supplied by Yagoda, but reported by the counter-intelligence personnel of a friendly nation of the Soviet Union. Stalin then dismissed Yagoda and appointed Yezhov as the chief of the political police. Yezhov immediately conducted an investigation after taking office and found that Yagoda had embezzled public funds." In addition, Le Matin reported that the Second Bureau of the Soviet Army General Staff (responsible for intelligence matters) has decided to thoroughly reorganize the political police. Since the dismissal of former director Yagoda, many senior officials of the bureau have been dismissed, including Vorovich, the head of Stalin's guard. It is rumored that his position will be filled by Colonel Rapoport, a confidant of Army Commissar Voroshilov of the People's Commissariat. The extraordinary meetings of the Political Council and the Standing Committee of the Control Commission of the Soviet Communist Party were held on the 5th of this month, and a decision was made on the attitude that the Soviet government should take towards the political police. (Havas, Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to the Soviet press, the political police discovered a plot to revolt in Chia Qia, and Stalin's confidant, the Communist leader there, Berya, made a large-scale arrest.

<h3>Truth or Falsehood of Trotsky's Crimes</h3>
<p>International Committee to Investigate - Dr. Dewey Appointed Chairman</p>
<p>Mexico City - After the verdict in the Moscow Parallel Center Counter-Revolutionary Case in January of this year, the leader of the anti-cadre faction of the Soviet Communist Party, Trotsky, issued a declaration here, requesting free people to organize an international commission to investigate the truth.

The chairman, the famous American philosopher Dewey, delivered a speech, stating that the task of this shareholder meeting is to collect materials and submit them to the plenary meeting of the International Committee for processing. As for the case of Trotsky, President Cardenas of Mexico "can be explained with the ideas of liberal democracy," which is commendable. (Havas, Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Development of Foreign Economic Relations after the Implementation of the New German Plan</h3>
<p>Balancing Income and Expenditure as Theoretical Basis - Foreign Trade Has Turned to Surplus</p>
<p>▲Haitong News Agency, Berlin - The German Ministry of Commerce recently issued an official report here, providing a very detailed review of Germany's foreign economic relations and its development, especially in the past year. It stated that the new plan, initiated by Minister of Economics Dr. Schacht and implemented on September 24, 1934, is based on the theory of balancing income and expenditure. In other words, the limit of purchases must be determined according to the amount of export income. After the implementation of the new plan, it immediately took effect in 1935, especially in the second half of the year. Germany's foreign trade was able to balance at this point. In 1934, Germany's trade deficit reached 284,000,000 marks. In 1935, it changed from a trade deficit to a trade surplus of 111,000,000 marks. This development continued throughout 1936, making Germany's foreign trade more favorable. By this year, Germany's trade surplus had reached a huge 550,000,000 marks. However, it should be solemnly stated that the increase in Germany's export trade cannot be entirely used to pay for imports. On the one hand, due to export competition, it is necessary to grant the other party long-term credit terms, which is exactly the opposite of the import situation. Therefore, in terms of foreign currency, the gradual activity of Germany's trade balance will actually achieve its purpose later. It should be noted that a large part of the foreign currency income from this trade is received through clearing methods, and the actual amount of foreign currency obtained is small. In addition, a large part of the surplus in 1936 must be used to repay old debts. In fact, all the old debts that existed before the new plan can be repaid. This is the realization of an important goal of the new plan. Furthermore, a part of the total surplus must be set aside for capital and other special purposes. The frozen deposits of foreign buyers must also be used for some export clearing. Therefore, if one examines the funds obtained by Germany from exports, it is known that most of Germany's foreign trade is paid for by clearing methods. Therefore, Germany cannot freely use the income from exports, because this income can only be used for a specific purpose. However, due to the continued increase in the trade surplus, Germany's debts in various settlements can be effectively reduced in 1936, and the main purpose of the new plan has been achieved by the smooth development of trade balance. However, the difficulties experienced in this process were not uncommon. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Hitler Agrees to Improve Relations with Russia</h3>
<p>British Newspapers Release News Again</p>
<p>Havas - Regarding the rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Sunday Chronicle has commented on whether or not the countries would form a formal alliance. According to the report, German officers had secret talks with Soviet officers and reported the details to the head of state, Hitler. When German General Ludendorff, Minister of Defense von Blomberg, and Minister of Aviation Göring recently visited Hitler, they all said that as long as the Soviet Union is hostile to Germany, Germany cannot have military security for even a day. Hitler immediately reiterated his claim that after the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan, it would be sufficient to deal with all contingencies. However, after the military leaders expounded on the advantages and disadvantages, Hitler finally expressed his approval for Germany to approach the Soviet Union.

<h3>International Conference on the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights in Egypt Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives from Eleven Countries Attended - Four Difficult Problems to Be Resolved</p>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland - The international conference on the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt is now scheduled to open in this city on the 12th of this month. At that time, honorary chairman, the President of the Swiss Confederation, Motta, will deliver an opening speech, and then the Prime Minister of Egypt, Nahas, will deliver a speech presenting his country's views. Most of the delegations from various countries have already arrived here, and the rest will arrive tomorrow. It is generally believed that the conference will not find it difficult to reach an agreement in principle on the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, but many detailed issues still require careful negotiation to resolve. At present, there are four issues to be resolved: ① Regarding the method of abolishing consular jurisdiction, should Egypt sign only one treaty with the countries concerned that applies to all foreigners uniformly, or should it establish separate treaties with each of those countries? ② How the so-called term "foreigner" should be defined may also become a problem. In this regard, the Egyptian delegation argues that, in addition to the people of protected countries (such as the Algerians and Tunisians of North Africa who are protected by France), people from all other countries are foreigners. ③ There should be a transitional period from now until the actual abolition of consular jurisdiction, but there are different opinions on the length of the period. Some advocate setting it at ten years, while others demand setting it at twenty years. ④ The organization and powers of the mixed courts during this transitional period should also be determined. Regarding this, the countries concerned intend to propose to Egypt that these courts be placed entirely under the country's sovereignty, but that special guarantees should be provided for lawsuits between the Egyptian government and foreigners. The above four issues can generally be resolved item by item by the international conference without encountering great difficulties. (Havas, Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] Representatives from Egypt and the eleven countries that enjoy consular jurisdiction in Egypt are scheduled to meet in Montreux on Monday to discuss a method of transferring cases currently tried by consular courts to mixed courts for trial, and to determine the period of this transitional arrangement. This conference was convened by the Egyptian government in accordance with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. The Egyptian delegation is headed by Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas himself. The British delegation is led by Overseas Trade Minister Wallace. An editorial in The Times of London stated that even if the consular courts are all beyond reproach, since Egypt is now an independent and progressive country, the existence of this humiliating judicial power will cause Egypt to lose the most important element of its sovereignty. The Egyptian government's proposal to expand the powers of the mixed courts and improve them has been submitted to the countries that enjoy special legal rights. The British and Egyptian governments have indeed reached a compromise on this point, but the attitude of other countries is still uncertain. Although there may not be open opposition to the abolition of these concessionary clauses, the details of the transitional arrangements will inevitably be matters that are difficult to negotiate. After this difficult problem is resolved, Egypt will have to handle another task, namely, to apply for membership in the League of Nations in Geneva. The British government will undoubtedly actively support this matter in accordance with Article 3 of the London Treaty. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador to France Transferred to Vice Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>French Foreign Minister Hosts Farewell Banquet - Encourages Goodwill and Cooperation</p>
<p>[Paris] After the Soviet Ambassador to France, Potemkin, was recently transferred to the position of Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of that country, Foreign Minister Delbos hosted a special farewell banquet for him at noon today. During the banquet, Delbos delivered a speech, praising Potemkin's efforts to promote mutual cooperation between France and the Soviet Union, stating that "During your tenure, we have always cooperated continuously in an atmosphere of sincerity and mutual trust to develop bilateral cultural and economic relations and to work for international peace. The Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact was established in this spirit, and we both uphold the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, which is also consistent with the spirit of the alliance." Finally, on behalf of the French government, Delbos asked Potemkin to convey his regards to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, and raised a glass to wish the Franco-Soviet cooperation cause to flourish and the Soviet League of Nations to prosper. Potemkin rose to answer, saying that France is the birthplace of liberalism and liberation ideas, which is why he has always expressed affection for France. "If nations want to carry out peaceful cooperation and seek its effectiveness, they must respect each other and recognize the principle that all nations have the freedom to choose their domestic political system. This is what I firmly believe." Potemkin then explained that France and the Soviet Union have the same views on various national defense issues, and explained the mutual cooperation between the two countries since the signing of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact (early May 1925), saying that "The mutual understanding between your country and mine is greater than before, and the situation of mutual respect is also something that was not achieved in the past. In addition, the economic and cultural cooperation between the two sides has become more consolidated. I am trusted by my government to be transferred to the position of Deputy Foreign Minister, and I will do my best to make the relationship between your country and mine more close, so as to be beneficial to the cause of peace and the progress of human culture."

<h3>By-Election for Members of Parliament</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Vote Held Peacefully</p>
<p>Beijing - Voting in the by-election for Members of Parliament was held here today. It closed at 1:00 PM. Ballot boxes have been sealed and vote counting began at 3:00 PM this afternoon. According to Belgian election law, voting is compulsory. Those wishing to waive their voting rights can cast blank ballots, but they must be present in person. Therefore, this morning, all voters in the city went to the various ballot boxes to cast their votes. At noon, the number of voters was particularly crowded. According to the constitution, the King does not have to vote. However, Prince Charles, the King's brother, went to the ballot box on Rue de Lorbeek, near the palace, at around 8:00 AM to vote. A group of children followed him along the way to express their welcome. Prime Minister Janson voted at 8:15 AM in Boitsfort, a suburb. The crowd cheered in tribute. As for Prime Minister's political opponent, Degrelle, the leader of the Rexist Party, he is not a voter in the capital district and therefore has no voting rights. Overall, the voting process today was peaceful and no major incidents occurred. (Havas News Agency, November 11th)</p>
<p>Beijing - Following the resignation of Rexist Party MP Olivier, the by-election to fill his seat representing the capital district was held this morning. There were as many as 300 ballot boxes. Voting was scheduled to end at 1:00 PM. The only candidates are Prime Minister Janson and Rexist Party leader Degrelle. The final results will not be announced before 8:00 or 9:00 PM tonight. The election campaign has been generally peaceful, except for a few minor incidents. Today, no disturbances are expected either. However, a few amusing incidents are worth mentioning. Yesterday, someone paraded multiple donkeys through the city, displaying a sign that read, "I am a donkey and I will vote for Degrelle." (Note: "donkey" means stupid.) In addition, a truck carrying campaign materials for Prime Minister Janson was stopped by female vegetable vendors when passing through the vegetable market, who hurled vulgar abuse at it.

<h3>Resumption of Business by Salt Merchants in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>New Salt Enters the Market and Salt Prices Gradually Decline; Salt Merchants Continue to Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The salt merchants of Guangdong Province, protesting against the increased surtax on salt and requesting improvements to the Guangdong-Hunan salt sales agreement, have twice petitioned the authorities without result, forcing them to suspend business in mid-last month. The salt in the city became scarce due to the salt merchants' suspension of distribution, and the price of salt soared from just over ten cents per catty to thirty cents, and continued to rise. Citizens were in danger of having to eat bland food, and food shops that used salt as a raw material were particularly affected. It is truly rare for a famous salt-producing area to experience a salt shortage. The salt merchants also suffered great losses from the prolonged suspension of business. When Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi passed through Hong Kong on his way abroad, they sent representatives to Hong Kong to stop his carriage and petition him, submitting a petition in which the representatives explained the decline of the Guangdong salt business in recent years and the recent increase in surtax, which was too difficult to bear. They pleaded with him to telegraph the Salt Affairs Administration to quickly rescind the order to increase taxes in order to maintain the salt industry and benefit the people's food supply. Minister Kong agreed to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to handle the matter appropriately. The petitioning representatives returned to the province on the 5th to report on the petitioning process to the salt industry and business groups. The salt merchants believed that the Ministry of Finance would not be able to respond to the matter in the short term. At the same time, the Guangdong Salt Transport Administration suddenly took a tough stance after slightly accommodating the salt merchants' five requests. Regardless of whether the salt merchants operated or not, the government decided to distribute the salt itself in order to alleviate the salt shortage in the market. The salt merchants, seeing that the situation had reached this point and that the government had taken decisive action, decided that it was useless to persist. On the afternoon of the 7th, they convened a meeting of more than 80 representatives from the Upper and Lower River Salt Industry Guilds, the Leiqiong Salt Transport Merchants Improvement Association, and the Guangzhou Salt Distribution Workers' Union. Chairman Huang Tianxuan reported on the current case, and it was then decided to first issue a notice to the industry to resume operations in order to avoid giving the government an excuse, while continuing to find ways to petition. The notice stated in brief that: "We, the salt industry and business operators, etc., are suffering from the increased salt tax and the restrictive Hunan sales agreement, resulting in business difficulties and no business to operate, for nearly a month. We have presented the situation of our hardships to various levels of government and appealed to various organizations for assistance. This time, forced by circumstances and suffering great losses, we have decided to temporarily endure the pain and resume operations as soon as possible, while continuing to earnestly request separate exemptions in order to alleviate our distress." Salt shops, for the sake of their capital, resumed distribution of salt on the 8th. It was found that on the 8th, more than 200,000 packages of salt grains were distributed from the salt boats in Shichongkou, Henan, and transported to the city to alleviate the current salt shortage. On the 9th, tens of thousands of packages of salt were again transported from the salt boats in Shichongkou and transported to the North River and West River areas. Therefore, from the 9th, new salt gradually arrived in the market, and the price of salt began to fall, from about 30 cents per catty to about 30 cents. The salt merchants are still actively pursuing the petition to abolish the surtax and the Hunan sales agreement and will send representatives to the capital in the coming days to petition the highest authorities.

<h3>Xiamen Merchants Oppose the Reorganization of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Various Industries Unanimously Oppose the New Tax Regulations; The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Provincial Government to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence - In Fujian Province, due to the imperfect bookkeeping of businesses, it is difficult for the government to manage and difficult to investigate the actual business situation. Therefore, it is not possible to levy taxes according to the regulations based on turnover or capital. In the past, the total amount was recognized and paid by the various industry guilds, and then the various business firms in the industry apportioned it themselves, which was similar in nature to contract donations. This time, the provincial government reorganized the business tax, promulgated new business tax regulations, and changed it to levy taxes based on turnover or capital. The various tax rates set are very high, and the Department of Finance conducted a special investigation, sending personnel to various business firms to verify their account books and verify their turnover as a tax standard. The business community in Fuzhou strongly opposed it. The various industry guilds in Xiamen held a joint meeting on the 8th and unanimously passed a resolution requesting a temporary suspension of the investigation and maintenance of the status quo. On the 10th, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce presented a petition to the provincial government, stating in brief: (Omitted above) ㊀ If the business tax is implemented, all kinds of special business taxes and exorbitant miscellaneous taxes should first be abolished uniformly. Otherwise, it is called reorganization but actually increases the burden on the people, which is not in accordance with the law or reason. ㊁ Xiamen is a transportation hub for goods in southern Fujian. All business is dominated by transportation and the profits are minimal. If the tax is heavy, the cost will also be heavy. How can it compete with other ports? Now the Department of Finance has announced new business tax regulations. The tax rate for food is 3/1000, which is twice the 1/1000 rate promulgated by the Ministry. The tax rates for other items are 5/1000, 8/1000, or 10/1000, which is very different from Article 4 of the Ministry's Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces, which stipulates that "the business tax rate should be calculated and levied using the per mille method according to the tax standard, and should not exceed 2/1000 at most." ㊂ Xiamen is a commercial port where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the environment is special. The burden of donations and taxes cannot be balanced. In the past, business tax was recognized and woven by the road. Foreign merchants and people were willing to acknowledge it in order to safeguard the reputation of the group. If the new regulations are implemented, foreign merchants and people will inevitably refuse to pay. In this way, foreign merchants and people can avoid the burden of business tax, and the cost is light. Chinese merchants cannot compete with them. The day when the new regulations are implemented and the collection method is changed is the day when Chinese merchants declare their death. In order to maintain their business and make a living, Chinese merchants are forced to switch to foreign nationality. This is inevitable in fact. It is heartbreaking to drive fish into the abyss. Based on the above facts, reasons, and environment, merchants believe that the implementation of the new regulations and the change in the collection method are a matter of life and death, and they are determined to fight to the death. The various industry guilds in the city held a joint meeting on the 8th of this month to discuss the matter. They unanimously advocated that before the special business tax and exorbitant miscellaneous taxes in the province are abolished, the tax rate is not revised, and Chinese and foreigners are not taxed uniformly, the provincial government should order the Department of Finance to temporarily suspend the investigation and maintain the status quo. A resolution was passed on record, and a letter was sent to this chamber to forward it to your government to understand the situation and approve the request. In accordance with the facts, we sincerely implore you to approve the request. The joint meeting of the industry guilds also decided to send representatives to the province to petition. The Finance Bureau began a special investigation on the 10th. Director Zhou Jingyu personally set out on the same day to investigate more than 150 shops on Zhongshan Road and Zhonghua Road. Most of them declined with excuses. The Finance Bureau stated that it will complete the investigation of the entire city within one month as scheduled, and will not delay it because there are opponents. (April 11th)</p>

It was written by Zhao Yunhuai in the early Qing Dynasty and is a handwritten manuscript. The handwriting is quite beautiful. The temple monks believe that this is extremely precious. Not only can it be used as a reference for the historical sites of Sanfeng, but the county also has one more document. According to the speculation of the general public, this chronicle was probably hidden during the Hong Yang Catastrophe. The temple now plans to print and publish it.</p>

He had noodles at Cheng Lanting and returned to the city at around 6:00 PM, then transferred to the Shanghai-Nanjing Express train to go to Beijing for official business. This time, Mr. Wang's visit to Wuxi was very secretive, so very few people outside knew about it.</p>
<p>News of a Madman Killing a Child</p>
<p>Tang Are, a resident of Jiangyin, who lived in a thatched hut at the Tonghui Road intersection near Huishan in this county, was 38 years old and made a living by selling spring water.

He actually took a sickle and brutally hacked the head of Hongsheng, the six-year-old eldest grandson of Wang Wubao, who lived in the same thatched hut, without asking any questions. Immediately, the brain matter burst out, blood splattered, and he fell to the ground and died. Tang Are quickly woke up and realized he had caused trouble. He was afraid of being punished and fled. He was later apprehended by the Huishan Police Station and sent to the Third Police Station for interrogation. Wang Wubao reported the case to the court for an autopsy. At 9:00 AM yesterday (the 11th), the prosecutor Ren led officials to conduct an autopsy, confirming that he had died of injuries sustained after being hacked.

The provincial authorities have ordered them to be built as soon as possible. The Longqing Road has already begun surveying, and the remaining lines are being surveyed. However, because the counties are mostly in high mountains and difficult to construct, the cost is very high. It is planned to raise a portion of the funds from the provincial treasury and set up a committee to raise funds for new roads in the counties, levying bamboo, wood, and charcoal donations to meet the needs of road construction. The Departments of Finance and Construction will discuss and proceed.</p>

<h3>Neijiang's Talents and Litigation</h3>
<p>— Gengya</p>
<p>"Above, there is no Emperor; below, there is no Clerk." This is a popular saying that the people of Neijiang take pride in. It means that Neijiang has a flourishing literary style and many talented people. In the imperial examination era, there were indeed many Neijiang people who achieved success in their careers, but among them, there was no Emperor who "held the position of the Ninth Five" and was "rich in all the seas," nor was there a Clerk who "managed documents" and "presided over county prisons" (roughly equivalent to the current chief of the secretary section) in the prefecture or county. (Because the people of Neijiang disdain to hold such petty official positions)</p>
<p>From the Tang and Song Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, figures such as the Number One Scholar, Prime Minister, Junior Guardian, and Grand Secretary were "never lacking in each generation" in Neijiang. After the founding of the Republic of China, education developed (with three public and private secondary schools and about 50 primary schools), and the talent of Neijiang people seemed to be above other counties in both quality and quantity. However, despite the development of education, superstitions such as feng shui are still prevalent among the people. In Neijiang, I often hear geomancers say things like "The terrain of a certain place is like a dragon coiling and a phoenix dancing," and "The direction of a certain mountain" is like "a vermilion ink box and a brush holder."</p>
<p>Neijiang is the main sugar-producing area in Sichuan. It is about 160 miles long from east to west and about 110 miles wide from north to south. In such a large area, sugarcane is grown almost everywhere, and sugar is produced everywhere. The annual export of sugar is worth more than 2 million yuan. The economic environment of the people can be imagined to be affluent.</p>
<p>Neijiang has abundant production and developed education. Since the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway set up a station here, the market has become increasingly prosperous. The people's lives should have been "peaceful and harmonious," but unexpectedly, the wind of litigation is very prevalent. The county government receives an average of more than 20 lawsuits every day. Criminal cases such as robbery and murder account for about 30%. Civil cases such as farmland, marriage, business, and debt repayment account for about 70%. On some days, the number of civil cases can reach as many as 40 or 50. Therefore, one county has two trial members and one military judge, who are still busy "enjoying themselves."</p>
<p>Moreover, litigation costs are very expensive. For example, in the event of a debt dispute, 3 yuan must be paid for a full 100 yuan, 6 yuan for 200 yuan, 8 yuan for 300 yuan, and 2 yuan for every additional 300 yuan. The number can be said to be not insignificant. Hiring someone to write a petition (i.e., a lawsuit document) costs at least 3 yuan per case. The messengers who deliver the cases are paid one dime for every ten miles. Most of the political police do not have a regular salary. The so-called "relying on the mountain to eat the mountain, and relying on the water to eat the water" The extra demands are just like the bills opened by the flag hall, which calculates the high room rate and adds the tea fee, and also specifically states: "Small bills are separate." However, although the litigation costs are so expensive, the people's habit of litigation is not reduced in the slightest. Once, someone actually wrote a petition for a debt of only 10 yuan. The plaintiff came from a remote village. After the litigation, the cost was more than several times the amount of 10 yuan. When asked "What good did you get back?", he answered that he was fighting for face!</p>
<p>Neijiang has a superior economic environment, and debt complaints are not necessarily for debt collection. Is everyone's wealth on the same level? That is not the case. It is said that they have a special custom: on the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, they go to the various ancestral halls to compete for the so-called "Lantern Festival lanterns." Some can light up to hundreds of lanterns, and some cannot even light one. There is a very common realistic proverb that says: "Rich families have ten lanterns, and children gather to play; poor families have one lantern, and father and son weep!" From this, we can imagine the disparity between the rich and the poor in the area.</p>

<h3>Yeh Shao-ying's Lawsuit Against the Shanghai Municipal Council Settled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Pays 300 Yuan in Compensation for Losses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council took drastic measures because some residents in the section of the International Settlement that had encroached on the boundary road refused to pay house taxes. Last month, they blocked the lane entrances of Yugu Village on Yuyuan Road with wooden stakes and blocked the drains. After repeated negotiations by the Shanghai Municipal Government and residents, the obstacles were removed and the drains were connected. However, Lawyer Yeh Shao-ying, resident of No. 62 of the village, had never defaulted on the taxes that he should have paid, and this time he also suffered illegal damage. He hired Lawyer Yang Linzhi to file a lawsuit against the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Consular Court and stated that he reserved the right to claim damages. The Shanghai Municipal Council, upon learning of this, was unwilling to further escalate the situation and negotiated a settlement with Yeh Shao-ying. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Council paid Lawyer Yeh 300 yuan in compensation for his losses, and Yeh withdrew the lawsuit. It is reported that the lawyer who handled the settlement with Lawyer Yeh was Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer in the legal department of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Bandits Kidnap People and Extort Money</h3>
<p>Water Patrol Team Responds to the Call for Help; Two Bandits Injured and Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Fayin, a native of Yong, 22 years old, has been working as a partner at Xie Xing Game Shop, No. 19 Nanxun Road. At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen and two colleagues went to Pier No. 5, No. 16 Pupu, South City, to purchase more than 1,500 pairs of wild chickens and wild ducks. However, while they were negotiating the price, five bandits suddenly rushed in, claiming that they wanted to borrow 50 yuan from Chen. Chen refused, and the five bandits kidnapped Chen and two colleagues to a small boat near the shore. The bandits took out handcuffs and threatened them. Chen shouted for help. The patrol boat of the Water Patrol Team rushed to the scene, but the bandits tried to resist arrest. The police fired shots in self-defense, resulting in two bandits being injured in the legs and captured. Chen's right leg was also hit by a stray bullet. They were all taken to the team and interrogated. Chen went to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and the two bandits were sent to the court for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Cohabitation Sought After Five or Six Years of Separation</h3>
<p>Madam Wan Counter-Sues for Divorce; Witnesses Testify</p>
<p>Wan Meichun, from Gaoqiao, Pudong, used to be a partner in the Liang Dongsheng fruit business in the Shiliupu area. He married Yang Lin Da (31 years old, whose father also works at the Zhi Ji fruit business in Shiliupu). They married when she was 19 years old and have two sons and one daughter: the eldest is 11, the second is 9, and the daughter is 7. Wan Meichun has been unemployed for a long time. Nine years ago, due to financial problems, the couple became estranged. Madam Yang returned to her mother's home and has been living there for five or six years. In 1933, Madam Yang filed a lawsuit in the local court, requesting a divorce, but the request was denied as the grounds for divorce were deemed insufficient. Last year, Madam Yang, along with her younger sisters, were walking in a fashionable manner on the Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, when they</p>
<p>Encountered Wan unexpectedly, leading to a major conflict. He allegedly assaulted her all the way to Shiliupu. Eventually, Wan's maternal uncle, Yang Jusen, mediated. However, the couple did not reconcile and resume living together. Recently, Wan sued in the local court, requesting his wife to return to cohabitation, citing that his aged mother might as well not have a daughter-in-law, and his children might as well not have a mother. Madam Yang, in turn, hired a lawyer and re-filed for divorce, claiming that Wan Meichun constantly pressured her to go home to borrow money, being greedy and insatiable, and that he frequently beat and verbally abused her, even engaging in day-long shouting matches at her mother's house, making things unbearable. His aim was to force his wife to return so she could be used as a cash cow for borrowing money. Therefore, she requested the court to grant the divorce. Yesterday, Judge Wang Run held a court session. Wan Meichun did not appear. Madam Wan testified that she was 31 years old, residing at No. 26, Old Yang Family Residence, Gaoqiao, and married Wan Meichun at the age of 19. She complained that after he lost his job, he pawned all the clothes and still forced her to borrow money from her mother's family. When she was 26, she</p>
<p>Left his home and is now helping with farming at her mother's home. He relentlessly demanded money and wanted to sell her off. Last September, she came to Shanghai at her mother's instruction to ask her father for money. She did not meet him and planned to visit her younger sister at the Tianhou Temple Bridge in the northern part of the city. While on the way with her female relative, Wu Fuying, they encountered her husband, which immediately resulted in conflict, and she was beaten as a result. Witness Huang Caifa testified that he was 24 years old, from Fengxian, and a partner in the Xieyuan fruit business at the intersection of Dongwen Road, Shiliupu, and that he was in the same trade as Madam Wan's father. On the eighth day of the eleventh month of last year, Wan Meichun fought with Madam Yang, knocking her to the ground. Cao Zhifu, another witness, testified that he was 20 years old, from Chuansha, and a partner in the Dacheng fruit business.</p>
<p>He saw them fighting. It was on the eighth day of the ninth month of last year. He was eating in front of the fruit business when he saw them dragging each other to the entrance of Zhang Danmao's fruit business. Yang Jinsen, Wan Meichun's maternal uncle, testified that he was in the real estate rental business, with his office upstairs at Zhang Hengmao's fruit business. Madam Wan was his niece-in-law. Last year's fight took place at the entrance of Zhang Hengmao's fruit business, but he did not see it. He was informed and went out to mediate, taking them to his brother Yang Jusen's home.</p>
<p>Whether there was mistreatment, he did not know. Whether there were injuries, he also did not know. Yang Jusen, Wan's maternal uncle, testified that he was 51 years old, in the grain business at No. 1 Doushi Street, and that Madam Yang was his niece-in-law. He did not know if there was mistreatment on weekdays. Last year, the couple came to his house with his younger brother. According to Madam Wan, she was beaten and in pain. She showed him, and there was a red and blue mark on her arm. She stayed until the first day of the tenth month when her father came to visit his daughter. She initially mentioned that she had gone to see Dr. Shi Xiaoshan for injuries. The court ordered the debate to be concluded, with the verdict to be announced at 4 PM on the thirteenth.</p>
<h3>### Movie Company's False Fire Alarm Disturbs Neighborhood</h3>
<p>Filming a Fire Scene Looks Realistic, Fire Trucks Make a Futile Trip</p>
<p>The No. 1 studio of the Mingxing Film Company, located at No. 1958, South Xuxu Road, near Fenglin Bridge in western Shanghai, was filming a fire scene for the movie "Dream World" at approximately 9:15 PM the day before yesterday. At the time, thick smoke billowed and the fire blazed fiercely, creating a prairie fire effect. For a moment, the red light lit up the sky, and the scene looked very realistic. Unbeknownst to the company, the neighboring residents mistakenly believed that a fire had broken out at the Mingxing Film Company's No. 1 studio. For self-protection, they urgently called the fire brigades of various districts in southern Shanghai, which rushed to the scene in their vehicles. When the firefighters arrived at the destination, they learned the truth and immediately drove back, while the nearby neighbors had been falsely alarmed.</p>
<h3>### Tomb of Pan Zhonghe's Family Grave Robbed</h3>

He went inside to investigate and discovered that two coffins had been stolen from the tombs. The grave pits were filled with garbage. A padlock and a carrying pole were found near the cemetery. A man was seen wandering nearby and was suspected of being involved. The police were alerted and arrested the man, who identified himself as Sun Haolin, 20 years old, from Shaoxing, an apprentice at Zheng Tianyuan's leather shop in Wangjia Lane. He denied robbing the tombs. The police station prepared a document and sent him to the court for interrogation.</p>

He has been working for the Lu family for many years. He was in good spirits the other day. The night before last, he and some friends were playing mahjong at the Lu family's house. Shen was the banker, and when East Wind was discarded, he held three South Winds and two each of West and North Winds. He discarded the North Wind, allowing the player across from him to call "West Joy". Shen was overjoyed, but joy turned into tragedy. He suddenly had a stroke, foaming at the mouth and losing consciousness. The owner immediately reported to the Da Mu Ming Zhong Police Station, which dispatched an ambulance.

<h3>### Fei Zibin Advocates Dietary Therapy</h3>
<p>Dr. Fei Zibin recently advocated dietary therapy. The rationale is that, to ensure continuous operation of a steam engine, it is necessary to keep adding coal. To maintain the brightness of a lamp, it is necessary to add oil in a timely manner. The reason why humans need to regularly consume food and drink to maintain their lives is similar to the relationship between a steam engine and coal, or a lamp and oil. Although humans rely on food and drink to replenish the components consumed by their physical activities, or to add new components to promote growth, or to provide the power source necessary for their activities so they can perform various actions, the types of food and drink are countless, and their nutritional value varies. Furthermore, the living conditions of the human body, such as strength, weakness, illness, old age, gender, and whether one is engaged in labor or rest, and the influence of weather and geography, mean that the nutrients required cannot but vary with the person and the time. If one does not know what is suitable and what is not, it is difficult to avoid the drawbacks of excess or deficiency. To remedy this, there is no better way than dietary therapy, also known as nutrition therapy or diet treatment, which is referred to as "food bait therapy" in Japan. In the past, in our country, medicine and food had the same origin. Those responsible for dietary therapy, according to the Zhou Rites, included food physicians. Later generations had imperial diet physicians. In ancient times, emperors and high officials carefully examined herbs before eating and drinking, or had dietary physicians manage their food, which is why they lived to a ripe old age. The "Pulse Classic" says, "For all diseases in the four seasons, stomach Qi is the foundation." Therefore, Master Wen Zhong said, "He Gong of North Mountain is good at medicine. He prioritizes diet over acupuncture and medicine." Sun Simiao also said, "Those who are doctors should first understand the source of the disease, know what is being offended, and first use dietary therapy. If it does not heal, then prescribe medicine, and nine out of ten times, dietary therapy can alleviate suffering." Therefore, modern dietary therapists also say that medicine should be used only when the disease is very severe, and dietary therapy can be used for the rest. They divide the treatment strategies of medicine into three categories: first, nutrition; second, medicine; and third, surgery. It can be seen that dietary therapy occupies an extremely important position in health care.</p>
<p>Examining our country's past, the practice of dietary therapy was very prevalent. According to records, the "Han History" has "Shen Nong Huangdi Food Prohibition," seven volumes; the "Song History" has "Shen Nong Food Taboos," seven volumes; "Lou Juzhong's General Remarks on Dietary Therapy," one volume; "Zheng Qiao's Food Mirror," four volumes; "Anonymous's Method of Nourishing the Body with Food," three volumes; "Yi Yin's Heart Mirror of Food Medicine," two volumes; the "Seven Records" has "Huangdi's Miscellaneous Food and Drink Taboos," two volumes; "Liu Xiu's Food Recipes," one volume; "Anonymous's Food Classic," two volumes; "Taiguan Food Classic," five volumes; "Taiguan Food Method," twenty volumes; "Food Method Miscellaneous Wine and Food Essential Recipes and White Wine and Crop Production Method," eleven volumes; "Family Administration Recipes," eleven volumes; "Food Illustrations and Four Seasons Wine Essential Recipes," one volume; the "Sui History" has "Laozi's Food Prohibition," one volume; "Cui Yuxi's Food Classic," four volumes; "Ma Wan's Food Classic," three volumes; "Dietary Nourishment and Therapy," twenty volumes; the "Old Tang History" has "Cui Hao's Greedy Classic," nine volumes; "Zhu Xuan's Food Classic," four volumes; "Zhao Wu's Four Seasons Food Method," one volume; "Lu Renzong's Food Classic," three volumes; and the "New Tang History" has "Yan Gui's Food Method," ten volumes. The "Art and Literature" section has "Meng Shen's Dietary Therapy Materia Medica," three volumes; "Lu Shiliang's Food Nature Materia Medica," one volume; and "Wang Yijian's Food Method," ten volumes. Unfortunately, these paintings are all not available now, and what remains are only "Hu Sihui's Essential Principles of Food and Drink," one volume; "Wu Rui's Daily Materia Medica," eight volumes; "Li Shizhen's Food Materia Medica," twenty volumes; "Shen Lilong's Food Materia Medica Compilation," twelve volumes; "Wang Shixiong's Diet Recipes," two volumes, etc. Just observing the number of these writings is enough to see the hard work of the ancients in the field of dietary therapy. I have carefully interpreted the ancient dietary therapy theories, and they mostly emphasize experience and lack theoretical elaboration. This is due to the times and cannot be overly critical of the ancients. For example, in discussing the nature, taste, suitability, and taboos of food, it is said that "spring Qi is warm, so it is advisable to eat wheat to cool it down, and one should not always stick to warmth; warm food and drink are forbidden. Summer Qi is hot, so it is advisable to eat beans to cool it down, and one should not always stick to heat; warm food and drink and overeating are forbidden. Autumn Qi is dry, so it is advisable to eat sesame to moisten its dryness; cold food and drink are forbidden. Winter Qi is cold, so it is advisable to eat millet to treat its cold with warmth; cold food and drink are forbidden." This speaks to the suitability and taboos of the four seasons. "Sourness and astringency are for contraction; eating too much will cause bladder problems and lead to blockage. Bitterness is for drying and strengthening; eating too much will cause the Sanjiao to be blocked and lead to vomiting. Spicy flavors steam and rise; eating too much will ascend to the lungs, causing the Rong and Wei to be out of sync and damaging the heart. Salty flavors surge and drain; eating too much will drain outwards into the pulse, exhausting the stomach, drying the throat, and causing thirst. The twenty flavors are weak; eating too much will soften the stomach and allow worms to pass through, causing fullness and heart-related oppression. Furthermore, spiciness moves Qi, so Qi-related diseases should not eat too much spice. Saltiness moves blood, so blood-related diseases should not eat too much salt. Bitterness moves bone, so bone-related diseases should not eat too much bitterness. Sweetness moves muscle, so muscle-related diseases should not eat too much sweetness. Sourness moves tendons, so tendon-related diseases should not eat too much sour." Furthermore, "liver disease forbids spicy food and should eat japonica rice, beef, mallow, dates, etc. Heart disease forbids salty food and should eat small beans, dog meat, plums, chives, etc. Spleen disease forbids sour food and should eat soybeans, pork, chestnuts, broad beans, etc. Lung disease forbids bitter food and should eat wheat, mutton, apricots, chives, etc. Kidney disease forbids sweet food and should eat yellow millet, chicken, peaches, green onions, etc." Also, "eating too much sourness will overwhelm the liver Qi and exhaust the spleen Qi, causing the flesh to be calloused and the lips to be chapped. Eating too much saltiness will shorten the bones and break the fat, causing the pulse to congeal and change color. Eating too much sweetness will cause the heart Qi to be asthmatic and the complexion to turn black. Kidney Qi will be uneven, causing bone pain and hair loss. Eating too much bitterness will cause the spleen Qi to be dry and the stomach Qi to be thick, causing the skin to be withered and the hair to be pulled out. Eating too much spiciness will cause the tendons and veins to be slack, and the spirit to be centralized, causing the tendons to be taut and the nails to be dry." This speaks to the biased movement of the five flavors. All of these theories inevitably suffer from the problems of simplicity, generalization, and superficiality, so the old theories all await supplementation by later generations. Fortunately, today, science is developed, and physiology and medical chemistry are flourishing. All the physiology and pathology of nutrition and metabolism have been thoroughly elaborated. Furthermore, due to the research on food chemistry, the nutritional value of various foods is also well understood. All of this is beneficial to dietary therapy and can supplement the deficiencies of old theories and elaborate on ancient experiences. However, science is advancing rapidly, and theories are constantly changing. Recent theories are more detailed, but they are not necessarily fixed and unchanging. For example, people with kidney disease used to be forbidden to eat salt, but now it is known that this is not the case, opening up the discussion of salt restriction. Patients with diabetes used to be forbidden to ingest carbohydrates, but now the opposite is true, advocating eating more carbohydrate-rich foods. This is what is meant by "what was right in the past is wrong now." Therefore, if one completely believes in recent theories, it is not yet correct. One must also consider experience to supplement the evidence to avoid the drawbacks of believing in the present and clinging to the past. Furthermore, what is more advanced is that I often see Western doctors today teaching foreigners' dietary methods to Chinese people. But they do not know that their daily lives and diets are different. Among Chinese people, those who have experienced foreign customs are less than one in a thousand. How many can tolerate foreign dietary habits if they are forced to adopt them, especially when they are sick? It is appropriate that there is incompatibility. Therefore, I have also said that the way of dietary therapy must also seek its nationalization to achieve the purpose of dietary therapy. My great-grandfather, Bo Xiong, was an expert in medicine and excelled in dietary therapy. He wrote a "Food Mirror Materia Medica" and also identified a "Materia Medica Diet Recipes" that were circulated in the world. Zibin inherited his legacy and has studied it for more than ten years. However, what I have been committed to in dietary therapy is the combination of ancient and modern, the consideration of both Chinese and Western, and the adherence to truth, effectiveness, and suitability to national conditions as the foundation. Over the years, I have used dietary therapy to assist medical treatment for patients, and it has often been remarkably effective. I am also able to benefit from "the best doctor treats the disease before it appears." I have been thinking of advocating this for many years. I have read the five books of Mencius five times. The United Kingdom is based on the people, but if the people lose their education, they may disrupt the world. People are nourished by food, but if their diet is inappropriate, they may harm their lives. There is no difference in reason between defending the country and hygiene. Therefore, the sages have said that "illness and war should be carefully considered together, and nurturing and teaching should be equally emphasized." Because I remember that our country is recently facing urgent foreign troubles and the people are becoming increasingly weak, strengthening the country must first strengthen the people, strengthening the people must first strengthen the body, and the best way to strengthen the body is dietary therapy. Therefore, the advocacy of dietary therapy is urgent. Therefore, I have attached myself to Mr. Wang's meaning of defending the country and hygiene, hoping to achieve the goal of revitalizing the nation, so I have added a dietary therapy department to this hospital to seek welfare for the Chinese people. However, I will only be a corrective arm and assistant and humbly await the gentlemen to support me.</p>

<p>Ouyang Lian, a Hunanese partner in the Xinhua Wood Shop at No. 325, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, is 39 years old this year. His wife, Mrs. Wang, is 30 years old. She and Ouyang, who are from the same hometown, live together on the upper floor of the wood storage house at No. 1, Yihe Lane, Rue Amiral Bayle. At 9 AM on the 9th, Ouyang asked his wife, Mrs. Wang, for 9 dimes for use. She refused. Ouyang became violent and beat her. After being persuaded to stop, Ouyang went out. When he returned to the apartment at 12 noon for lunch, he beat her violently again, causing her face to swell. Ouyang then went out to the Jianghai Customs. Mrs. Wang, seeing her husband leave, thought about it and suddenly became suicidal. She used a hemp rope to hang herself on the stairs. At 4:30 PM, her younger brother, Wang Chusheng (also a partner in the Xinhua Wood Shop), discovered it at home and immediately rescued her. She had not yet breathed her last. He immediately summoned an ambulance and sent her to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save her. She died at 5:30 PM.

If three incumbents have already been elected, then three committee members should be elected in this item, (E) Electing one member to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Land Committee (If the previous committee member has already been re-elected, this election should be considered already held), (F) Electing 27 executive committee members of the Association, ㊆ Matters for Report: (A) Reporting on the resolutions of the Representative Assembly during the tenure of the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Mr. Zhong Sijun, which were notified to the Council but received no response, as follows: Resolutions of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly on April 10, Year 20: 1. The Association should urge the Shanghai Municipal Council to actively improve defense, eliminate kidnapping and gambling, and strictly prohibit public officials from soliciting illegal fees. 2. The Association should immediately urge the Shanghai Municipal Council to employ as many Chinese with municipal knowledge and experience as possible to serve as senior officials. Resolutions of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly on April 16, Year 23: 1. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to immediately abolish the music band; employees with fixed-term contracts should be given severance pay in accordance with regulations. 2. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to expand major cultural undertakings within the Settlement as much as possible. 3. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to levy a land tax on vacant land within the Settlement from the date of resolution of this case. 4. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to promptly and effectively implement the text and spirit of the exchange of notes on March 16, 1928, and uniformly follow the precedent of the Police Department in selecting qualified Chinese as deputy directors in the offices of the Secretary-General, etc. 5. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council, starting this year, to compile annual reports, budgets, and final accounts in both Chinese and English and submit them to the Association before April 1st for distribution to registered Chinese taxpayers to be reviewed by the first meeting of each term of the Representative Assembly. 6. Discuss that in the future, the Shanghai Municipal Council should give full consideration to taxpayers and stakeholders for any new facilities. If any event is related to Chinese taxpayers or especially linked to the business community, the content of the event should be submitted to the Association for discussion, and the Association should send a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to notify relevant commercial organizations to send representatives to conduct thorough deliberations and, if necessary, allow these representatives to attend relevant meetings of the Municipal Council to express their opinions, so as to facilitate overall planning, achieve perfection, avoid disputes, and facilitate implementation. Resolutions of the first meeting of the Representative Assembly on April 15, Year 25: 1. Petition the government and authorize the Municipal Council to promptly negotiate and agree with relevant countries to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Municipal Council by four, starting in the year 1937, to indicate greater cooperation. 2. Urge the Municipal Council to strictly enforce the ratio of 20 to 1 between house tax and land tax in accordance with the Yangjingbang Property Regulations, and no exceptions should be made to the house tax regulations, and the burden-sharing method implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Government should be followed. (Totaling ten cases) ㊇ Matters for Discussion: (A) Motion 1: The Shanghai Municipal Council proposes to increase all municipal general taxes from 14% to 16% and land tax from 7‰ to 8‰ from July 1, Year 26 to the next annual meeting of taxpayers, should be rejected and not allowed, and the Council should be ordered to do its best to economize. (Explanation) This year, the Municipal Council, on the grounds that revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, has implemented a disguised form of salary reduction, which in reality greatly harms the Chinese staff of the Municipal Council and greatly benefits the foreign staff. The so-called exchange subsidy of 1.67 million yuan has been added to the salaries of foreign staff. The Chinese directors and committee members have striven in vain. Following the so-called fact that there is no more room for austerity, the Municipal Council proposes to increase taxes, namely the general tax from 14% to 16% and the land tax from 7‰ to 8‰. According to the calculation, the amount of the increase is 14.29% higher than the current tax rate, which is about 15%. Our taxpayers should pay attention to this huge tax increase. Regarding this case, the chairman of the Assembly has spoken in detail about the circumstances of the proposal and voting by the Municipal Council. As for the waste of the Municipal Council, it is an undeniable fact. The protection of national economy by the foreign staff of the Municipal Council is far beyond what we can achieve. In theory and reason, the Municipal Council is jointly run by Chinese and foreign residents in the First Special District, and its expenses should be calculated according to the combined wealth of all residents. However, senior foreign staff have forgotten or ignored the position of the Municipal Council and adhere to the erroneous view of maintaining their national economy. For example, the prices quoted by the Zhonghua Book Company and the Commercial Press for the Chinese annual report and gazette are about one-third less than those quoted by foreign printing houses, but they are determined to print at a higher price, and the paper used must be purchased from abroad at a higher price. Other examples include engineering materials, which are mostly not purchased locally but must be purchased from abroad at a higher price. Is this not treating the Municipal Council as their private property? The situation of this tax increase proposal is very different from the previous tax increase proposal. Last time, the opposition could be falsely accused by the Municipal Council as being due to the claims of irresponsible people. This time, the opposition comes from five Chinese directors. If the Municipal Council dares to falsely accuse it as being due to the claims of irresponsible people, then how can cooperation be explained, and how can the Municipal Council itself be explained? To put it bluntly, cooperation is not desired to be continued, the Municipal Council becomes a group of irresponsible people, and the Municipal Council becomes an inorganic body without reliance, just a chemical name. If this is not corrected, the taxpayers of the First Special District will enter a state of disorganization. Bentham, the author of the principle of legislation, takes human sentiment as the basis of legislation and goodness as the purpose of legislation. The general interest is the basis of the theory of legislation. Tax increase is legislation. The implementation of all municipal affairs must also go through legislation. Arnold and others seem to have completely ignored the above points from various facts. Also, the famous German general Ludendorff wrote in "Study of Total War," "To seek the firm maintenance of the national spirit, mechanical methods (referring to forced oppression) should not be used, but should be aroused according to human sentiment." Even if Arnold of the Municipal Council abuses the right to cast two votes per person, he seems to harbor the prejudice of "forced oppression" and disregard human sentiment. The Japanese director did not reserve the right to vote on the tax increase proposal and opposed it unanimously with the Chinese directors. As a result, Arnold will still abuse the right to cast two votes per person. Based on the above reasons, those who ignore human sentiment should be corrected with human sentiment, those who ignore goodness should be corrected with goodness, those who ignore the general interest should be corrected with the general interest, and those who ignore the true nature of the Municipal Council should be corrected with the true nature of the Municipal Council. Is the truth far away? If we want the truth, the truth will come. What is the truth? Conforming to human sentiment and based on human sentiment, we pass this motion. (B) The Shanghai Municipal Council should treat Chinese and foreign staff equally. It is found that within the Shanghai Municipal Council, the treatment of Chinese and foreign staff is extremely unfair. Foreign staff have long vacations, exchange subsidies of one-third of their salary, exchange subsidies for savings, and exchange subsidies for long vacation pay, while Chinese staff are not entitled to any of these benefits. Even retirement pensions, medical expenses, travel expenses, etc., are also different between Chinese and foreign staff. Even foreign chauffeurs have contractual guarantees, while Chinese primary school principals have no contracts. The details have been recorded in a certain newspaper on April 2 this year. The Association believes that the Shanghai Municipal Council should only ask about the working ability of the serving staff and should not treat them differently due to different nationalities. The Municipal Council should be ordered to strictly correct the previous wrongdoings to show impartiality. (C) Other Proposals.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Resigns</p>
<p>The chairman of the Association, Wang Xiaolai, sent a letter to the Representative Assembly, saying: Dear Sirs, Xiaolai has been in charge of the Association since 1928. It has been ten years in a blink of an eye. In recent years, I have repeatedly resigned at each election, but as a result, I have been compelled by public duty and unable to get rid of it. Now that the election period is approaching again, I would like to express my sincerity to my colleagues again. Xiaolai is straightforward in nature and does not know how to sing high-sounding tunes. I am brave in handling affairs and have never been afraid of difficulties. To seek happiness for the public is my original aspiration. However, since I am not a gourd, how can I not eat? I have been in Shanghai for thirty years, spending too many days for others and too few days for myself. I have held many positions, forgetting myself for the public. Even if people do not suspect me of being in charge, I deeply feel the pain, reaching the point where I cannot distinguish between morning and evening, and my diet is ruined. After investigating the results, even if the group's public affairs are not delayed due to trivial matters, my family's livelihood will inevitably be cut off due to abandonment. My colleagues love me and will surely understand me. I sincerely hope that they will consider my long burden and give me the opportunity to rest. The people are also tired and should be replaced. I respectfully express my sincerity and hope for your consideration. This is addressed to the Representative Assembly of the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association.</p>
<h3>Finland's First Envoy to China, Mr. Valvanne, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving in China by Ship from Japan Yesterday Afternoon at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Finland is establishing an embassy in China, and its first envoy to China, Mr. Huge Valvanne, the Finnish minister to Japan, concurrently assumes the post. Mr. Valvanne, upon order, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the Japanese ship "Shanghai Maru," which docked at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. Mr. Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of the city, representing Mr. Tang Shi-xuan, Mr. Zhao Tiezhang, deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Mr. Nystén, the Finnish consul general in Shanghai, went to the ship to welcome him. Mr. Valvanne is of medium stature, dressed in a gray woolen suit, and is affable and friendly. After disembarking, he drove directly to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. Mr. Valvanne met with reporters on board the ship. According to him, the diplomatic representative of his country in China has always been the Finnish consul general in Shanghai, Mr. Nystén, serving as chargé d'affaires. Now, he is honored to be formally sent to China. The two countries of China and Finland have always had friendly relations. In the past, they have already signed a treaty of friendship, and there are currently no diplomatic issues that need to be negotiated. Sino-Finnish trade has made progress in recent years. Finland mainly exports paper to China, while Chinese goods exported to Finland are mainly silk and tea. At the beginning of his term, what he wants to say is only to increase the political and economic relations between the two countries. He has been serving as the minister to Japan for three and a half years. Although he has passed through Shanghai incidentally, this is his first formal visit to China. As for when he will go to Nanjing to meet Chairman Lin and present his credentials, he still needs to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of your country. It will be decided after Chairman Lin returns to Nanjing. In the future, the embassy will be set up in Shanghai. Before the embassy site is found, a temporary office will be set up in the Finnish consulate in Shanghai (Mayersiai Road, French Concession). Because he resides in Tokyo, his family is still in Japan, so this trip is only intended to stay for a few weeks, and then he will return to Japan and then bring his family to China for a long-term stay. Mr. Valvanne is 42 years old this year. He studied at the University of Toulouse in France in his early years. He has served as secretary in the Finnish embassies in the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Switzerland, and other countries, chargé d'affaires in Italy, and has also served as deputy minister of foreign affairs, and then served as minister to Japan, and is a prominent figure in the Finnish diplomatic circle.</p>

Because it was late at night, it had to be postponed until this morning before entering the port. It is scheduled to dock at the North Bund Wharf of China Merchants at 7:00 AM. Our side has received notice that Zhou Jue, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Tang Shi-xuan, representing the acting mayor of the city, Sun Lixing, representing Yang Hu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, as well as Mr. Alessandrini, the chargé d'affaires of the Italian embassy, and Mr. Nilon, the Italian consul general in Shanghai, will all go to the ship to welcome him.</p>

<h3>Friendly Visit Between Chinese and American Women Leaders</h3>
<p>Madam Chiang to Visit the United States This Summer, Madam Roosevelt to Visit China</p>
<p>Continental Press reports (10th) from Shanghai, receiving news from the United States that Madam Soong Mei-ling, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Madam Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the President of the United States, may visit each other this year. It is expected that Madam Chiang will go to the United States in June, and at that time, the famous Mount Holyoke College for Women and Oberlin College in Ohio will confer honorary degrees on her. If President Roosevelt comes to the Orient this year or early next year, it is said that his wife will also accompany him. An American news reporter visited the President's wife in Little Rock and asked about the President's trip to the Philippines and the Orient. The Madam replied, "I will go by plane. I especially love flying." She also said that she does not like to travel long distances, so she does not want to accompany the President by warship. According to reports, Pan American Airlines' air service between Manila and China will be launched in May of this year, so if Madam Roosevelt flies to the Philippines, she may visit China as well. It is expected that many women's groups in China will receive this news and will invite Madam Roosevelt to visit China.</p>

<h3>The Accounts of the Two Railway Bureaus Are Handed Over to the Audit Office for Verification</h3>
<p>The British Bank Group No Longer Sends Personnel to Audit</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has always had the revenue and expenditure accounts of all its operations audited by personnel sent by the British Bank Group, and the Bureau paid 1,500 yuan annually as remuneration for the auditors. Since all the revenue and expenditure accounts of the Bureau last year were audited by the Shanghai Audit Office, all procedures have been extremely clear and detailed. Then, after several consultations between Huang Boqiao, director of the two railway bureaus, and Lin Jinyu, director of the Shanghai Audit Office, and negotiations with the British Bank Group, there was no need to send personnel to audit again. After several considerations, the bank group confirmed that the auditing methods stipulated by the Audit Office were more detailed than the bank group's auditing methods. The two parties decided that the bank group would no longer send personnel to the Bureau for auditing starting this year, and all remuneration for the auditors would also be stopped starting next year. This also shows an increase in our foreign reputation.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Held Its First Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The drought in Sichuan is becoming increasingly serious. The Shanghai Association of Sichuan Natives and the Sichuan Business Charity Association jointly formed the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association here on the 29th of last month and successively sent representatives such as Li Qingfan to Nanjing to jointly organize with the Beijing Association of Sichuan Natives and appeal to the Central Government. The representatives returned to Shanghai on the 10th. According to reports, the result of the petition was that the Central Government had allocated 1 million yuan of disaster relief bonds. The Relief Association has its headquarters in Nanjing and its Shanghai branch. The Association's office is attached to the associations of Sichuan Natives in Nanjing and Shanghai. Dai Jitao was elected as the chairman, and Wu Dingchang, Xu Kan, and more than ten others were elected as vice chairmen. The Shanghai branch held its first meeting yesterday (the 11th) at 2:00 PM. More than 20 people including Zhang Shulin, Zheng Yushu, Li Qingfan, Tang De'an, Tang Jinbai, and Gui Rongfen attended the meeting. Tang De'an chaired the meeting and Yang Zechen recorded the minutes. After Li Qingfan reported on the petition process in Nanjing, the following important motions were resolved: ㊀ Ratifying the members proposed by Li Qingfan in the Nanjing Relief Association, ㊁ Telegraphed Zhu, chairman of the National Relief Commission, to go to Sichuan to investigate the disaster and preside over the distribution, ㊂ Telegraphed Liu Xiang, chairman of Sichuan Province, to request the implementation of disaster relief measures, ㊃ Appointed people to attend the meeting daily to handle affairs.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Strive</h3>
<p>Exemption of Foreign Rice Tax in Guangdong Province</p>
<p>The matter of exempting foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province is currently being vehemently opposed by various parties. Relevant departments of the central government are seriously reviewing the case and will submit it for discussion again at tomorrow's Executive Yuan meeting. However, this matter has a significant impact on rice-producing provinces, so these provinces are sending urgent telegrams to various parties for assistance to maintain the livelihood of farmers. The Doumi Guild of this city yesterday received several urgent telegrams from Hunan and Hubei, which, in addition to detailing the harm of exempting foreign rice tax, also provide detailed price adjustments for existing rice to serve as a basis for assessment. Furthermore, Luo Qinghua, the representative of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Gu Xin'yi and Chen Ziyi, the representatives of the grain industry of six provinces and cities, continued to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday to strongly advocate against the exemption. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Vigorous Efforts by Representatives from Various Regions</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Gu Xin'yi and Chen Ziyi, the representatives of the grain industry of six provinces and cities, continued to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "To Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: Regarding the case of exempting foreign rice tax in Guangdong Province, agricultural, commercial, and civic groups from rice-producing provinces have repeatedly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and relevant departments to request its revocation, with exhausted voices. The advantages and disadvantages are presumably understood. Qinghua and Xin'yi, etc., will go to Beijing another day to petition again. It was decided at the Yuan meeting to first submit it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for review. Considering that the government is now striving for economic construction and self-reliance, Guangdong Province suddenly announcing the tax exemption for foreign rice is completely contrary to this policy. According to newspaper reports, Fujian Province has successively requested to follow suit and exempt taxes. It can be seen that government orders should not be divergent, and tariffs must be complete. Otherwise, if other rice-importing areas successively request, what will the government do? And the entire national economy will be completely destroyed. We have always admired your concern for farmers and merchants and your care for the national economy. When this case is brought up for discussion at the Executive Yuan regular meeting, we earnestly request that you resolutely preside over it and provide a swift remedy to ensure that the tax exemption order is revoked. We remain in apprehension. Respectfully, Luo Qinghua, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Gu Xin'yi and Chen Ziyi, the representatives of the grain industry of six provinces and cities, kowtow."</p>
<p>A Summary Presented to Chairman Wu of Guangdong Province</p>
<p>The representatives of rice merchants from various provinces and cities presented the following summary to the newly appointed Chairman Wu of Guangdong Province yesterday: (1) Guangdong Province needs more than 20,000 dan of rice per day, totaling 600,000 to 700,000 dan per month. With three months until the new rice season, the total rice needed is about 3 million dan. (2) Within these three months this year, the amount of domestic rice shipped to Guangdong was 450,000 bags in January, 600,000 bags in February, and 750,000 bags in March. The rice tax is recorded, excluding imported foreign rice. According to January of this year, which coincided with winter and the Yangtze River's low water level, transportation was inconvenient, so the amount shipped to Guangdong that month was relatively small. In March, as the spring water gradually rose, transportation became more convenient, and the amount shipped to Guangdong increased month by month. (3) Guangdong Province currently has 400,000 to 500,000 dan of rice in stock, while the provinces and cities of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shanghai have a total of more than 2 million dan of rice stored and ready for shipment, and there are still more than 10 million dan of surplus grain that can be exported, and the overall calculation is even more than this number (for example, the report from more than 20 counties in Hunan Province to the Executive Yuan stated that the province has as many as 13.2 million dan of grain in stock, which shows the wealth of the producing areas). (4) The market price of domestic rice in Guangdong Province: (A) The highest quality late rice from Jiangxi and Hunan is currently sold for 10 yuan 30-40 cents per 180 jin, plus 1 yuan for water and handling fees, which is 6.3 cents per jin, and 1 yuan can buy 15-16 jin. (B) The medium quality early rice from Jiangxi and Hunan is currently sold for 9 yuan 40-50 cents per 180 jin, plus 1 yuan for water and handling fees, which is 5.8 cents per jin, and 1 yuan can buy 17-18 jin. (C) The highest quality brown rice from Hunan and Hubei is currently sold for 8 yuan 50 cents per 180 jin, plus 1 yuan for water and handling fees, which is 5.3 cents per jin, and 1 yuan can buy 19 jin. (5) According to the market price the day before yesterday, two or three weeks ago, the highest quality late rice from Jiangxi and Hunan was sold for 11 yuan 60-70 cents, the highest quality early rice was sold for 10 yuan 70-80 cents, and the highest quality brown rice from Hunan and Hubei was sold for 10 yuan 20 cents. Now it has fallen by 1 yuan 30 cents to 1 yuan 70-80 cents, and the market situation of supply exceeding demand is enough to prove it. (6) The price of rice in Guangdong Province is actually related to the decline in the value of the national currency. It seems to be more expensive. Guangxi Province has a surplus of rice, but its market price is as high as 15-16 yuan, which is higher than that of Guangdong Province. This is also because the currency value is even lower. It has not been heard that the people of Guangxi Province are calling for expensive rice. Guangdong Province does not cure the root cause and increase the currency value, but cures the symptoms and exempts taxes on imported foreign rice, leading to a tragic fall in domestic rice and causing the collapse of the rural economy. (7) The domestic rice stored in various provinces has been halted from being shipped to Guangdong due to the tax exemption on imported foreign rice, and Guangdong Province has not been able to import foreign rice immediately. It seems that there is no assistance on both sides, and there may be a shortage of rice. We request that you preside over the matter and quickly seek remedies so that the city can calm people's hearts, and domestic rice can be transported to Guangdong steadily, benefiting both farmers and merchants. Respectfully presented to Wu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association Requests the Withdrawal of the Decision</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting the withdrawal of the decision by Guangdong to exempt import duties on foreign rice (brief summary). Our country has been based on agriculture since ancient times. The land is fertile and vast, and the number of farmers accounts for more than 80% of the country's population, making it a world-renowned agricultural country. In recent years, due to frequent disasters and poor harvests, coupled with the impact of the global economic panic, agricultural prices have fallen, and the rural economy in various places has declined and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Farmers are displaced and starving, and their suffering has reached the extreme. Since the completion of domestic unification, our central government has strived to revive the countryside, improve agricultural technology, and save the rural economy, sparing no effort in promoting these goals and increasing import duties on foreign rice and wheat, implementing a tariff policy to protect agriculture. Last year's bumper harvests in various places were due to the concerted efforts of the entire country, and the rural economy was beginning to turn around. Unexpectedly, Guangdong Province exempted import duties on 2 million dan of foreign rice. When the news came, rice prices in various places plummeted, and farmers and merchants were in distress and panic. Currently, the national rice reserves are sufficient to relieve the rice shortage in Guangdong, and the new grain in Guangdong Province is about to be on the market, so there is no need to purchase foreign rice with tax exemption. This not only goes against the central government's policy but also hurts the vitality of the countryside. Our association, for the sake of the livelihood of farmers, dares to urgently petition, hoping that the central government will consider the livelihood of farmers and withdraw the tax exemption order. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association kowtows.</p>
<p>Accurate Survey of Rice Reserves in Hunan Province</p>
<p>The joint office of the export rice merchants in Changsha City telegraphed the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild of this city, providing the accurate number of rice reserves recently obtained from the survey of chambers of commerce, farmers' associations, and miscellaneous grain industries in various counties under the province. The details are as follows: The surplus rice and grain in various counties of Hunan before the new harvest this year are as follows: Yuanjiang: 800,000 dan of grain; Ningxiang: 200,000 dan of grain; Hengyang: 800,000 dan of grain; Hengshan: 300,000 dan of grain; You County: 200,000 dan of grain; Li County: 700,000 dan of grain; Linli: 800,000 dan of grain; Anxiang: 800,000 dan of grain; Changde: 600,000 dan of grain; Hanshou: 600,000 dan of grain; Taoyuan: 400,000 dan of grain; Liling: 200,000 dan of grain; Anren: 300,000 dan of grain; Chaling: 200,000 dan of grain; Nan County: 800,000 dan of grain; Xiangtan: 700,000 dan of grain; Yiyang: 700,000 dan of grain; Xiangyin: 500,000 dan of grain; Zhuzhou: 400,000 dan of grain; Lukou: 400,000 dan of grain; Changsha: 1,400,000 dan of grain; Changsha rice: 800,000 dan; Jinggang: 300,000 dan of grain; Yijiawan: 300,000 dan of grain. The total grain and rice reserves in the above thirteen places are 13.2 million dan. In addition, there are 80,000 dan of rice waiting to be transported in the station area, and 300,000 dan of rice have been transported to Guangdong in the past two weeks. Joint office of export rice merchants.</p>
<p>Wuhan City Urges Consistent Advocacy</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild of this city received a telegram from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild of Hankou City, which was circulated to all sectors of the country, regarding the tax exemption on foreign rice: "To the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Guild and forwarded to all sectors, Guangdong Province has exempted import duties on 4 million shi of foreign rice since April 1. The Executive Yuan, due to opposition from agricultural and commercial circles and public opinion nationwide, has submitted the case to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for re-examination on the 6th. However, the tax exemption on foreign rice has a great impact on the rural economy and the country's entire economic construction. The guild hereby puts forward the following points, hoping that the people of the country will pay attention and that the government will listen to public opinion, maintain agriculture and commerce, and resolutely stop Guangdong Province from exempting taxes on imported foreign rice: (1) Tax exemption on foreign rice will lead to unsalable domestic rice, and the countryside will fall back into bankruptcy. (2) Tax exemption on foreign rice violates the policy of reviving the countryside. (3) Tax exemption on foreign rice causes a large amount of cash outflow, shaking the entire economic construction. (4) Tax exemption on foreign rice undermines tariff barriers and destroys unified taxation. (5) Tax exemption on foreign rice is tantamount to advocating foreign goods, affecting the public's psychology of using domestic goods. (6) Tax exemption on foreign rice violates the resolution of the Executive Yuan. (7) Tax exemption on foreign rice increases the unemployment crisis in the industrial and commercial circles. We hope for consistent advocacy to achieve the goal. Hankou City Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Industry Guild, respectfully."</p>
<p>Agricultural and Commercial Circles in Wuhan State Their Grievances</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hankou City Miscellaneous Grain and Oilseed Industry Guild, the Hankou City Grain Industry Guild, the Hankou City Fifth District Farmers' Association, the Hankou City Eighth District Farmers' Association, and the Hanyang Grain Industry Guild jointly issued a circular stating: "Since the case of tax exemption on imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province, agricultural and commercial circles and local governments in four provinces have telegraphed to request a halt to the exemption for two weeks. This matter is of great importance to the national economic lifeline and has a huge impact on the livelihood of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the provinces of Central China. This industry has more accurate information and has to announce the beginning and end of the case, the true situation, and future malpractices to our compatriots across the country, in the hope that the truth will be revealed to the world. (Omission)...Since the occurrence of this case, a group of people in Guangzhou who are blinded by profit have deliberately created an atmosphere of famine in Guangdong to sensationalize the world. They do not know that the fact is absolutely absurd. Guangdong Province is inherently a rice-deficient area, lacking 5-6 million dan per year. In the past, Guangdong merchants purchased and supplied rice from Wuhu, Shanghai, and Hankou. Since the great flood in Central China in the Republic of China, the supply has been insufficient, and Guangzhou began to replace it with foreign rice. A small number of wealthy merchants in Guangdong have been operating continuously for several years, with strong influence and great profits. They are able to exclude domestic rice. (The editorial of the Wuhan Daily in this city has the most detailed information.) At first, they said that domestic rice did not suit the taste of the people of Guangdong. Then, they used the excuse that domestic rice was a drop in the bucket and could not meet the supply. In fact, they are all creating false air. The so-called taste is not suitable. Before the import of foreign rice, the people of Guangdong ate Anhui and Hunan rice together. Is it domestic rice? The so-called a drop in the bucket, last winter, the Yangtze River was shallow, and the shipping was not prosperous. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway transported more than 60,000 tons. The so-called shortage of supply is even more inconsistent with the facts. In terms of Guangdong Province, the climate is the earliest, and the new grain can be put on the market in June. In terms of the four provinces of Central China, the rural rice market sources in Changsha, Hankou, Jiujiang, and Wuhu have tens of thousands of dan or more per day. At this time of the spring flood, the water and land are continuously transported to Guangdong. How can there be a shortage of supply? On the first day of this month, foreign rice was exempted from tax and entered Guangdong. Guangzhou domestic rice plummeted by two yuan and one dime, and no one cared. The riverbank in this city fell to two yuan per dan. According to letters from Xunwu, Changsha, and Shanghai, they all plummeted from one yuan and six dimes to two yuan per dan. Recently, due to the initial news of a prosperous rice market in Hankou, farmers from all over the countryside competed to transport rice to Hankou. Unexpectedly, the market plummeted, and the farmers borrowed money, and capital was not easy. Some farmers even had no way to survive or die. As for the general workers and boatmen who depend on the grain industry, they have all been frowning recently. Because the rice market was booming last month, tens of thousands of dan were traded every day. Recently, only a thousand or so dan are traded, and the outlet is blocked, which has a great impact on the livelihood of workers. (Omission below)"</p>
<h3>A New Model Sanitarium Village to be Constructed in this City</h3>
<p>Relying on the Environment of Nature, Not Emphasizing Medicine. Grand Tea Party Held Yesterday at Yi Wu Garden</p>
<p>Physician Pang Jingzhou, Ding Huikang, and veteran journalist Zhang Zhuping of this city hosted a spring outing gathering for people from all walks of life at Yi Wu Garden on Hu-Min Road yesterday. More than 300 people, including Wu Zhihui, Chen Jintao, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Shaoping, Liu Haisu, Li Zhifu, Lu Shenlian, and Shi Yonggeng, attended. The scene was grand and lively, and the scenery of the suburbs was very attractive. The garden is adjacent to the county government, with convenient transportation and a quiet environment. A new type of Shanghai sanitarium village has been initiated by famous medical circles in this city. The main purpose is not to emphasize medical equipment, but to use the natural environment to provide a place for all walks of life to recuperate and restore their health. All facilities are based on the principle of public economization. The famous architect Xi Fuquan has been invited to survey and draw the plan of the new village. The following is an excerpt from the originator, Dr. Ding Huikang, on the origin of the village:</p>
<p>In recent years, medical construction has been trending towards natural rehabilitation, that is, staying away from the hustle and bustle of the city and placing oneself in the beautiful environment of nature, which is a necessary condition for early recovery of health. Several years ago, Huikang was ordered by the Ministry of Health of the Ministry of Interior to investigate the anti-tuberculosis measures and the facilities of sanatoriums in various countries. He deeply believed that sanatoriums are indeed necessary tools for adjusting health. However, in terms of the general society in China, flat civil sanatoriums are the most urgent task. The original site of Shiyuan Garden in Beiqiao Town on Hu-Min Road has been expanded by 50 acres, with convenient transportation and a beautiful environment. The original owner generously transferred it for the sake of public welfare. He specially organized a Kang Le company with friends, agreeing to establish a flat civil sanatorium village. He and public health expert Li Tingan, Lu Bohong, and celebrities from all walks of life have observed it and all said that the place is far away from Shanghai, which meets the conditions for a fresh environment, and is adjacent to the county government, which is very safe. Moreover, the garden layout is not easy to achieve in a day. If it can be used to set up a sanatorium, it will definitely save trouble, time, and money. He hopes that all gentlemen will not hesitate to give advice. The architecture is a modernized rural villa style. Each house is isolated and has a living room, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and utility room. Each house can be lived in alone, or many people can live together. The monthly fee is more than ten yuan to several tens of yuan, and meals are self-catered for convenience. Horticulture - guests can freely irrigate and raise the flowers, trees, fruits and vegetables planted in the garden, and the bees, pigeons, chickens, rabbits, ducks, and fish raised in the garden under the guidance of the manager, both for leisure and labor, so as to receive the effect of restoring health through work. This is the beginning in our country.”</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Strictly Cracks Down on Workers Going Abroad</h3>
<p>Formulated Three Measures to Crack Down, Separately Instructing Relevant Parties to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received petitions from gentry in Yongjia and Qingtian counties, Zhejiang Province, stating that there are unemployed ruffians who are recruiting workers to go abroad, which affects local construction, and requested that it be stopped. After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formulated three measures to crack down on workers going abroad, and has instructed them to be implemented separately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Request to Prevent Workers from Going Abroad</p>
<p>The gentry of Wenzhou presented a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, saying: "To the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Your Excellency, we are writing to you that the people of our province who go abroad to work as laborers or peddlers are mostly from Qingtian and Wenzhou. Recently, there have been unemployed ruffians in various coastal areas of Wenzhou who are promoting the ease of making profits and the comfort of life in Europe. All strong and useful workers are deceived by them, and there is hardly a month without people going abroad. It is not impossible to go abroad for trade, but after these workers go abroad, they either wander in foreign countries or marry and have children and live abroad for a long time, resulting in the gradual desolation of the land in their hometowns, which inevitably affects local construction. And recently, a large number of rascals have arrived here from Shanghai, making various propaganda, saying that the Italian Steamship Company will give preferential treatment to Chinese people starting this month. For every 100 people going abroad, the ship price can be calculated at half price, only needing more than 200 yuan of national currency to reach Italy. If there is no work to do after arriving in Italy, Italians can also send them to Abyssinia to reclaim wasteland, where they can earn huge wages. We have investigated that there are more than 10,000 workers who have gone to Italy in the past. If workers continue to export every month, Wenzhou will become a district of the old and the young in three or five years. We are teaching and saving the countryside. We are reluctant to remain silent. We specially request that your department quickly stop this. The locality will be fortunate."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Stipulates Three Measures</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately formulated three measures to prevent workers from going abroad: (1) Issue a notice to all passport-issuing agencies to stop issuing passports to people from Wenzhou and Qingtian to go abroad. (2) Send a letter to the Italian Embassy, ​​transferring the order to the Italian Steamship Company, not to load workers from Wenzhou in the future. (3) Issue a notice to the Chinese Embassy in Italy to pay attention. If any such workers are found landing in Italy, they should be deported back to China on the original ship at any time.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Guild Files Appeal to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Trade Unions in Various Districts Petition to Order Capitalists to Fulfill Obligations; Workers at Mei Ya Textile and Thread Factories Go on Strike</p>
<p>After the Bureau of Social Affairs adjudicated a resolution to the workers' demands for improved treatment in silk weaving factories, the Industry Guild disagreed and filed an appeal to the Municipal Government. Trade unions in various silk weaving industries jointly petitioned to order capitalists to fulfill the conditions. Workers at Mei Ya Textile and the main factory went on strike again the night before last. The following records the details:</p>
<p>The Capitalists File an Appeal According to Law</p>
<p>After the Bureau of Social Affairs adjudicated a resolution to the demands for improved treatment conditions proposed by workers in silk weaving factories, it ordered both labor and capital to comply. The Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Guild submitted the Bureau of Social Affairs' adjudicated resolution to a meeting of members. The members believed that increasing wages by 10% was not sustainable for factories in fact. As for paying wages on statutory holidays, subsidies for female workers during childbirth, and subsidies for workers' illnesses, none of these measures have been implemented in the silk and thread industries in Shanghai, so they have filed an appeal to the Municipal Government in accordance with the Administrative Appeal Law.</p>
<p>Trade Unions in Various Districts Jointly Petition</p>
<p>Pan Yuncai of the First District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union, Zhang Boxi of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union, He Yao of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union, Hu Ying of the Seventh District Silk Weaving Industry Trade Union, and Wang Jisong, the representative of the workers from various factories in the Hubei District of Shanghai, petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs on the previous day, requesting that the Silk Weaving Industry Guild be ordered to forward instructions to the factories to fulfill the conditions as soon as possible to resolve the dispute. They were all received by Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section of the Third Department, who instructed them to submit official documents for instructions to the director for review and approval.</p>
<p>Mei Ya Workers Go on Strike Again</p>
<p>Workers at the Mei Ya Textile Factory and the Mei Ya Main Factory in Dapuqiao, Nanshi, totaling about 1,500 to 1,600 people, did not receive wages for the work stoppage on the Huanghuagang Martyrs' Memorial Day on March 29. The factory did not pay the wages when they were paid the day before yesterday. Representatives were sent to negotiate with the factory, but there were no results. All the workers went on strike at 6 pm the night before last. Li Weixiong, sent by the Municipal Party Committee, and Zhu Guilin, sent by the Bureau of Social Affairs, rushed to persuade the workers to return to work yesterday morning, and ordered the workers' representatives to be responsible for explaining to the workers.</p>

<h3>The Public Concession Shanghai Volunteer Corps Determined to Retain</h3>
<p>Mr. Arnold's Statement</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that there were rumors circulating that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to save expenses, was planning to disband the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Last Saturday night, Mr. Arnold, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, took the opportunity of the annual banquet held by the Volunteer Corps to announce at the banquet that the Council, being compelled by economic needs, had revised the expenses of several departments, but regarding the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, it was determined to retain it as an integral part of the public concession's security, without any other intentions. The rumors of disbanding the Volunteer Corps are completely untrustworthy. Members of the Volunteer Corps need not worry too much about the continued existence of the Corps. The Russian Detachment is also important and will be retained, it was said. That night, Colonel Graham, the Commander of the Volunteer Corps, first gave a speech, stating the strength of the Volunteer Corps and thanking the public concession's police officers for their cooperation last year, thereby increasing the perceived value of the Volunteer Corps' duties when incidents occur in the concession. Then, Brigadier-General Smallett, the commander of the British Army in China, gave a response on behalf of the guests, briefly stating that the Volunteer Corps had been mobilized eleven times in the past thirty years, with remarkable achievements, and is indispensable to the concession. Colonel Graham's command is commendable, and this is due to the full support of all members, which enabled the Corps to achieve such excellent results. Then, Mr. Arnold stood up and gave the aforementioned speech, and finally, Major Payne, representing the police department, thanked the Volunteer Corps for its assistance in maintaining security, and then everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>China-U.S. Seamless Telephone Service Soon to Officially Begin</h3>
<p>Call Rates to Be Announced Soon; Additional Harmonic Telegraphs to Be Installed in Radio Stations</p>
<p>The Sino-American wireless telephone service, which was previously drafted into a contract by the American International Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and our Ministry of Communications, has been revised and signed by both parties. The contract was passed by the Executive Yuan last month and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, which is generally expected to be without problems. According to news from the local communications authorities, Sino-American wireless telephone service is scheduled to be implemented within this month. The call rates have also been agreed upon by both parties. Taking Shanghai in our country and New York in the United States as the center, each three-minute call between Shanghai and New York will cost US$27. Calls lasting less than three minutes will also be charged as one call. In addition, the call rates for other domestic cities and major U.S. cities will be increased or decreased appropriately based on the call rates between Shanghai and New York. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau will announce these rates within a few days. As for the technical aspects, our Liu Hang International Radio Station will connect to the San Francisco Radio Station in the United States, and then San Francisco will relay to various U.S. cities. Currently, the radio station is conducting trial calls with San Francisco for one hour every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday morning, with clear sound quality, so the technical aspects have become quite proficient. However, due to the significant time difference between China and the United States, after the official start of telephone service in the future, it will only be open for one or two hours each morning. In order to facilitate callers, the radio station also plans to install harmonic telegraphs to record the other party's speech. After the call is completed, the harmonic telegraph will replay it once, so that the caller can rehear the other party's questions and answers, and not be unclear due to the short duration of the call.</p>

<h3>Railway Police Interfere with Mail Transportation</h3>
<p>Currently Under Negotiation</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM on the 10th, when the post office at the train station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Train No. 21 was unloading mail, a railway police officer No. 770 suddenly stepped forward and ordered the small carts carrying bags not to stop in front of the mail car, unreasonably preventing the mail transportation. Postal workers Zheng Yihuai and Shen Dexin argued with reason, but the police officer blew his whistle wildly, summoned various police officers, and drew out a box cannon pistol as if facing a formidable enemy, and held onto Mr. Zheng, causing the buttons on his uniform to be torn off and fall to the ground. The order was disrupted, causing the station's postal workers to temporarily suspend operations, and the incoming mail was delayed. Later, after mediation by superiors from both sides, the situation temporarily subsided, but the police officer's unreasonable and barbaric behavior, preventing mail transportation and insulting public officials, has reportedly been reported to the higher authorities and trade unions, and is currently under negotiation.</p>

<h3>"Soft Rice King's" Bad Nature Hard to Change; Young Girl Reports to Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>Wang Suzhen, a young girl from Shaoxing, is twenty years old, beautiful, and lives at 11 Jun'an West Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei. In September of last year, the girl went out shopping and met a local youth named Lin Shihui. After a brief chase, they forged a tragic relationship. They whispered sweet nothings and made promises of marriage. But Lin was a "soft rice king" who only cared about money. Recently, seeing that the girl was not giving him money, he had malicious intentions. On the 24th of last month, he stole clothing and the girl's private savings of 157 [Currency] and quietly ran away, his whereabouts unknown. After the girl searched everywhere, she finally ran into him on the road and dragged him to the police station to accuse him of his past actions. The police station transferred the case, which involved seduction and theft, to the First Special Court for trial. Due to jurisdictional issues, the court did not accept the case and ordered Wang to file a lawsuit in the local court. Lin begged the girl in every possible way not to pursue the matter. The girl was deceived by him again and followed him back to his place. Unexpectedly, three days later, Lin stole several tens of dollars of property again and disappeared. At this point, Wang realized that she had been deceived and thought that her body, spirit, and money had all been harmed. She then reported to the police station and requested that he be arrested and brought to justice for trial.</p>

<h3>Apricot Blossom Village</h3>
<p>— Tao Kangjun</p>
<p>"A drizzling rain falls on the Clear Bright Festival, the traveler on the road walks as if his soul would leave him. "I venture to ask, where can a wineshop be found?" A cowherd points to Apricot Blossom Village in the distance." - Du Mu. Apricot Blossom Village, what a poetic place name. Wouldn't most people find some joy in it? If you are fond of mellow wine, then it will intoxicate you even more. Although on this desolate and quiet street at present, you cannot find a wineshop where you can drink to your heart's content, just the three words "Apricot Blossom Village" are enough for you to appreciate.</p>
<p>According to the Records of Jinling, the Apricot Blossom Village where Du Mu bought wine was next to Waguan Temple in the west of Nanjing City Gate. Because the scope of the ancient city was unusually narrow at the time, the area around Apricot Blossom Village and Waguan Temple was outside the city. After Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty established his capital in Jinling, in order to make the city more majestic, the ancient city was specially enlarged. In this way, Apricot Blossom Village and Waguan Temple were pulled into the corner of the west of the city gate.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the residents of Apricot Blossom Village were driven by the idea of ​​living up to the name, so they also planted many apricot trees. Therefore, when spring came to the world, this place was also very picturesque, making you linger, but there was not a single wineshop here to embellish it, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>In fact, Apricot Blossom Village is too remote. Except for a few literati who entertain themselves with poetry and books, who occasionally come here to pay their respects, no one wants to walk into this secluded place.</p>
<p>Apricot Blossom Village is even more deserted now. Even the few apricot trees that decorated it have long been stolen by a group of friends who are overwhelmed by life's pressures and used to burn pots. If there were not the three big characters "Apricot Blossom Village" displayed on the wall, then no one would remember that this was a good place for Du Mu to buy wine.</p>
<h3>Spring is in Xuanwu Lake</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The lovely spring girl, since she brought the warm sun to the earth, everything for people is full of the atmosphere of spring. Of course, it is most pleasant to take a trip to the suburbs at this time of bright spring. Therefore, the Xuanwu Lake in the capital is once again filled with tourists who are rich and have free time.</p>
<p>The willows on the shore of Xuanwu Lake are illuminated by the spring light and nourished by the spring rain. They have long been full of new green. The small fish in the lake are also floating on the water, receiving the warm sun. This scene is really beautiful. The four words "mountains and clear waters" in ancient books can be transferred to Xuanwu Lake. No wonder the general masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies are all flocking to it!</p>
<p>The boats in the lake have been deserted for several months, but now they are active again! The boat ladies are all crowded on the shore, vying to solicit tourists. The cars and carriages by the lake are parked there in a whole string. These are all the privileges of the rich. Ordinary people can only "sigh at the car." Even if they want to enjoy the spring scenery of Xuanwu Lake, they can only "walk slowly instead of riding."</p>
<p>Most of the tourists are in pairs. Among them are newlyweds, unmarried couples, and unengaged lovers. There are even temporary wild ducks. They sit hand in hand in the boat, leisurely in the middle of the lake, whispering sweet words. That situation is really no less than a fairy family. If single men or girls see it, they may be moved by the spring heart.</p>
<p>The camera is their best companion. Probably out of every ten pairs of men and women, there are always four or five pairs who bring cameras. Taking a few photos full of the atmosphere of spring by the trees, by the lake, or in the boat is so enviable!</p>
<p>Where is spring? Spring is in Xuanwu Lake.</p>
<h3>Wormwood Dumplings</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Every year around the Qingming Festival, in my hometown - Menghe, every household makes wormwood dumplings, which are a must for worshiping ancestors in tombs. They are eaten by themselves and given to relatives and friends. Most of these relatives and friends are naturally returning from other places. Every year I go back to my hometown to sweep the tombs, and I have a large income. The first is my grandmother's family. As soon as they hear that my parents and I have arrived home, my cousin immediately carries a bamboo basket full of dumplings and sends them over. My cousin is such a sincere and meticulous person, she specifically instructs: The ones with the pointed tops are sweet, with sesame seed filling. The round ones are salty, with green vegetables and dried tofu filling. The oblong ones are meaty, with scallions and meat filling. She also tells me to recognize this type of food, because it was made by her own hands. The second one is my aunt's family, but her family is not doing very well, so it is only filled with green vegetables. In fact, in my hometown recently, there are very few families that use meat to make wormwood dumplings. Almost all of the countryside is made up of economic families.</p>
<p>Wormwood is a type of wild grass that is only eaten during the Qingming Festival. It sprouts almost at the same time as horse orchids and wolfberries. Only the leaves with a white back are useful. The ones with a green color are bitter and unpleasant. The hometown people call the ones with a white back of the leaf "glutinous rice wormwood." When I used to live in the countryside, I saw my mother make it. First, she picked the wormwood clean, discarded the roots and rotten leaves, put it in a stone mortar, and pounded it with a pestle until the wormwood was thick. Then, she mixed it with glutinous rice flour, kneaded it and kneaded it again to make it even. The rice flour would turn emerald green, and then the dumplings could be made. My family used to have a stone mortar, and it was very busy during the Qingming Festival. This family would come to pound sesame seeds, and that family would come to pound wormwood. Often, my own family would fall on the last day. Other people had already swept the tombs, but my family's wormwood dumplings were still in the steamer. But my mother didn't mind, and to this day, people still call her "good good wife." Maybe this is the harvest. But that stone mortar was broken long ago and was used by my uncle as a pig trough.</p>
<p>People and things are changing. My cousin, who sent me wormwood dumplings last year, is now the mother of a child. And my own family is struggling under the stone plate of life. Occasionally, I recall the events of my childhood, which vaguely appear before my eyes. When the willow branches sprouted, and the paulownia flowers were in bud, the fields, pond sides, and feng shui banks were filled with men and women picking wormwood. I also held a small hoe, and my younger brother carried a bamboo basket, following the other children to pick. My mother would sometimes wear a blue scarf on her head and come out to pick wormwood herself, and she would also dig wild water chestnuts for us to eat. But now her hair is already gray, and she hasn't eaten wormwood dumplings made by her own hands for several years.</p>
<h3>Chatting About Spring Vegetables in the Pastoral Style</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival, as usual, I must return from paying respects at the graves of my ancestors. Superficially, it naturally seems like an inexhaustible display of filial piety, but in reality, my intentions are not solely focused on the ancestral graves, but also on the rustic flavors found near the family tombs. Because the Qingming season is the time when tender leeks and fresh bamboo shoots are most delicious in the countryside. Every year when I return to my hometown to sweep the graves, my diligent relatives always invite me for a small drink. What is available in the countryside isn't bream or steak. From when I was a child, accompanying my father and imposing on them, up until now, thirty years later, when I bring my own children, the rustic flavors I've tasted have remained almost entirely unchanged. Here are a few of the dishes:</p>
<p>㊀ Leeks stir-fried with dried tofu. The leeks we buy and eat in the city, even though we try our best to choose the freshest and most tender ones, are so tough that one can’t help but think, “Their fibers could be used for weaving.” But the leeks in the countryside are cut fresh from the fields, washed clean, and immediately put into the wok, so they have a tendency to melt in your mouth. ㊁ Bamboo shoots mixed with lettuce. Although this dish isn’t hard to find in the city, the sweetness of the bamboo shoot meat and the overflowing fragrance of the lettuce are certainly not something city dwellers can taste. This is because these sweet and fragrant flavors only remain untainted for one or two hours after being harvested from the soil. If they are transported to the city and displayed in the market, they will have already become bland and tasteless. ㊂ Wolfberry shoots. This is a wonderful item to have with wine. Although it is occasionally sold in city markets, it is often dry and withered, or already rotten, and the quality and flavor are no longer acceptable. In the countryside, young children pick them from the weeds, bring them home, wash them clean, and immediately cook them in the pot. Not only is the astringency reduced, but the aroma is also refreshing, greatly stimulating the appetite. ㊃ Shepherd's purse. In the city, I dislike shepherd's purse the most because it contains too much astringency and a slightly bitter taste. But the shepherd's purse eaten in the countryside, even though very little oil is used, is plump, tender, and delicious enough to make one's cheeks quiver with delight, and its fragrant aroma makes one reluctant to put down one's chopsticks. — In addition, there are also ㊄ wind-dried chicken and ㊅ cured meat, which are both dishes with unique flavors. Although the country cooking methods are not as sophisticated as those in the city, the original flavors are not diminished by the simplicity of the preparation. It's like an absolutely beautiful woman who, even without makeup and wearing disheveled hair and rough clothes, still doesn't lose her beauty.</p>
<p>Every year during Qingming, when I return to my hometown to sweep the graves, my relatives always treat me with the six dishes listed above, along with newly brewed fine wine. While eating and drinking, I admire the green willows and red peach blossoms outside the window, and chat with the old farmers about mulberry and hemp, drinking until I am completely drunk. In the afternoon, when I am about to leave, my relatives always diligently treat me to shredded bamboo shoots and clover (i.e., alfalfa), mixed into flour, and made into thin pancakes. Although it is a vegetarian snack, its freshness and fragrance linger in the mouth and do not dissipate.</p>
<h3>Soviet Women Are Once Again Embarking on the Path of Feminine Beauty (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Soviet women work just like men, and neither men nor women are allowed to adorn their appearance. However, since the Soviet Union implemented the Second Five-Year Plan, the authorities have changed their policy, wanting the young women in the country to wear beautiful clothes, and the young men to groom their appearance neatly. The authorities once said to the farmers and workers: "Foreigners who come to the Soviet Union say that the Soviet people have rigid faces and show a tense expression. You must quickly change your appearance, and make people feel that you are lively and happy."</p>
<p>Of course, it is not an easy task to change the appearance of 170 million people in a short time. However, the leaders of Soviet Russia do not believe that there is anything that cannot be done. In the past nineteen years, they have restored the status of a world power. If you pay attention to the changes in the faces of the people in Moscow, Leningrad, and other places, and then look at the Soviet Union's plans for the near future, you can't help but believe that they can say it and do it. In the autumn of last year, Soviet Russia announced that it would open 715 new barber shops next year, with a total of 2,860 barber chairs, and that 1,412 more barber shops would be added in the year from August 1917. Last year, 4,940 barbers were trained in special schools, and this year, 10,750 people graduated from such schools. These barber shops are fully equipped, and each has a commissioner to monitor the implementation of hygiene regulations. The authorities also sent 7,500 barbers to the interior to groom the faces of farmers and workers who were full of worries.</p>
<p>Now, passing through the streets of Moscow, you can often see many peasant women coming out of beauty salons, with their nails painted in beautiful colors. When the female ticket sellers on the trams collect your fare, the bright red tips of their fingers also reflect in your eyes. Many factories also have nail salons attached, and even cake companies have been ordered by the government to keep their nails clean for hygiene purposes. Almost all the women in the country have cut their hair and styled it in various fashionable ways. One of the largest department stores in Moscow offers free perms to girls. Fashionable girls also dye their hair in various colors, and most have their eyebrows plucked and redraw them with pencils into long, curved, thin eyebrows. Even the soldiers in the Red Army feel fragrant with the hair tonic sprinkled on their heads.</p>
<h3>Swapped Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: A White Board, Red Splatters, A Humble Inn, Tears on the Road, Reed Flowers and Maple Leaves, Alone Through Half a City of Autumn</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, two lines of tears could no longer be held back and flowed down. Moreover, when the tears flowed down, the momentum was very strong. He tried to restrain himself, but instead began to sob. Unable to bear it, he immediately collapsed on the edge of the table, crying with a low, moaning sound. Youmei first stood there, staring at him in a daze. After a few minutes, she herself began to shed tears. So she took out her handkerchief, wiped away her tears, and gently stroked his shoulder, saying: Lan, don't be like this. Fortunately, there are still a few weeks left, so let's slowly think of a way. If you cry like this, and the people downstairs find out, they will think that I came here and said something that offended you. Let's find something fun to do. Let's be happy for a while first. Menglan then straightened his back, wiped his tears with his handkerchief, and shook his head a few times. Youmei didn't dare to mention the matter again, but just talked about the affairs of her classmates. Seeing that the sky was getting dark, Youmei didn't want to go downstairs to eat with him, fearing that her tear-stained face would be exposed. She put the stationery and envelope for Guoshi in her painting bag. She folded the letter and put it on her person. They agreed to meet again in a couple of days, and she quietly left. The next day, Youmei passed the items on to Guoshi, and also told him about the things they had talked about. At that time, Guoshi had a forced smile on his distressed face, but he didn't add a single word of criticism. After Youmei left, he unfolded the stationery and letter and played with them for a while, thinking to himself, Menglan is indeed a free and easy woman. He says that life is for finding happiness, not for finding troubles. This is very right. From this day on, he will gather his spirits, seek happiness, and not think about troubles. Another week passed, full of suffering. After eating lunch, he couldn't help but wander around in the courtyard. There was a whispering sound in the sky. When he looked up, it was a row of wild geese flying from north to south. A sudden thought flashed in his mind: Ah, autumn is deep. What am I still brooding about at home? So he told his mother that he wanted to go out of the city for a walk, changed into a thinner long coat, and took some pocket money, walking alone. The autumn day was dry. It hadn't rained for about ten days, so there were only a few white clouds floating in the sky. The clear wind blew in his face, not only not cold, but also making him feel refreshed. So he deliberately chose desolate paths and walked towards the north of the city. In those years, Nanjing's prosperity was in the city. The north of the city was just some vegetable gardens and wild bamboo forests. (156)</p>

<h3>Straw Sheds Are Going to Be Torn Down Again</h3>
<p>— Nai Yi</p>
<p>Last July, because the Municipal Council wanted to demolish the straw sheds in the Hongkou area, a tragicomedy was staged in which shed dwellers resisted the Municipal Council's police with manure brooms and chamber pots. Later, because the shed dwellers repeatedly petitioned various parties, and also organized their own associations to protect their homes with a united determination, the situation was eased by the words "postponing demolition". After that, there were also reports of building public housing and only allowing demolition but not reconstruction.</p>
<p>Now, we are seeing a petition from more than 25,600 straw shed dwellers in the Public Concession to the Chinese Taxpayers Association for assistance. According to the petition: "The Municipal Council's notice to demolish all straw sheds within the concession by May 1st has not been withdrawn." As for public housing, it is said that "the Bureau initially replied that public housing could be built separately, but then said that there were many empty houses west of Lan Road, so there was no need to build any more", so "the previous order to demolish is still difficult to change".</p>
<p>"There are many empty houses west of Lan Road," that is probably the truth. In fact, it is not just west of Lan Road. Even in prosperous areas such as Nanjing Road, there are "many empty houses". Fearing that the air is not clean, there are also empty houses in the residential areas west of Shanghai. Unfortunately, "if the people were able to afford their own rent, there would be tens of thousands of mansions in the concession, why would they need the Bureau's instructions, and why would they huddle in straw sheds and beg endlessly?" And "after driving the people out of the concession, they would have to stay far away in the border areas of the Chinese territory, and they would no longer be able to work in the concession. If more than 20,000 people lose their jobs at the same time, even if the poor are not worth pitying, it seems inevitable that it will become a major social problem!" And when the "disaster of destroying homes is imminent", in order to fight for a straw shed in which they can "huddle", they can only make final preparations with "their lives and property": "If the Bureau insists on its own way and refuses to listen, the people will have no choice but to gather together as a whole, wait quietly for trampling, and would rather suffer misfortune together than see anyone's straw shed demolished."</p>
<p>From the perspective of people like us who are accustomed to foreign-style houses, or at least have nothing to do with straw sheds, the filth and unsanitariness of straw sheds are an eyesore, and they should indeed be demolished. It is not just a matter of demolition; in order to enhance the appearance, it is best to build foreign-style houses so that they can also "live in tall buildings". But what about now? Since they cannot afford to rent the empty houses west of Lan Road, and the public housing for resettlement is dismissed on the pretext of there being many empty houses, foreign-style houses are of course out of the question. And "even the pieces of eaves that barely shield them from the wind and rain are taken away". Will we really "see them take their wives and children and wander the streets" while we "live in tall buildings" to appreciate this "picture of refugees"? If there is still some humanity in some people, if they still want this dilapidated society to have a moment of peace, I think they should say "no"!</p>
<p>The deadline of May 1st is coming soon. Will we "endure to rectify the appearance", and under the armed forced removal by the Municipal Council, watch these hardworking masses suffer the "suffering of taking their wives and children and wandering the streets, having nowhere to sleep"? Or will we rise up and "negotiate with the concession authorities to build public housing for resettlement, and before the construction is completed, the straw sheds must not be demolished"? — And if we stand by and watch, and the shed dwellers clash with the Municipal Council, resulting in a more serious outcome, who should be held responsible for this?</p>
<h3>The Wall</h3>
<p>— Shen Jia</p>
<p>Below the window is a narrow alley made of solid materials. Across the alley is the grass field of a small school. Because the mud wall is too low, the grass field seems to be right below my window.</p>
<p>That school is probably a kindergarten, but I'm not sure. Otherwise, that grass field always belongs to the kindergarten students. The area of that grass field is not very large, but someone who is used to the alleys of small schools must envy that school's sufficient funding, or even become jealous out of envy, "Aren't they wasting the land too much?" That grass field is at least half the size of the alley where I live.</p>
<p>The equipment on the grass field is also quite thorough, with small swings, small slides, small wooden horses... In one corner of the field, separated by narrow white wooden boards, I often see a young female teacher dividing those innocent and lively children into two teams and using a kind of singing to determine the winner. This kind of game seems to be the most popular among the children, but without the teacher, they don't know who wins and who loses. It's as if children like to gamble, but they don't know what kind of cards they are gambling with. And I still haven't figured out what the name of that game is.</p>
<p>When I read the newspaper every morning, the grass field is already filled with laughter. Those children are willing to come to school very early before class. Some smaller children are accompanied by their Amah, and they look a little shaky when they walk, but they still like to come to the grass field to play. This forces their parents to order their Amah to bring them biscuits for breakfast. Naturally, at such a young age, and growing up in a wealthy family, going to kindergarten is already the best kind of game; and there's also a grass field, and there's a young female teacher to teach them to sing. School is really a great place!</p>
<p>I myself didn't receive this kind of education when I was young. The children in the private school were so annoying that I couldn't believe it, and there was never a child who acted like a child. Reading was all there was, and singing and games had to wait until after school, when we would secretly find a quiet place to play for a while. And it was always those old routines like "The golden rooster crows, the silver rooster crows, who wants the myna's eggs?" and "Riding a white horse," and hide-and-seek. In less than three or five minutes, they would all slip away. We liked home when we were children.</p>
<p>Looking at the grass field every day, it seems that a kind of jealousy grows from the bottom of my heart. Why didn't we have that kind of happy kindergarten when we were children? So I looked at my five-year-old child, who often tells his mother that the teacher at school wants him to go to school, and also gives him biscuits to eat, and he has also learned the polite greetings, "Good morning, teacher! Good morning, children!" My wife thinks that a five-year-old child should also be sent to kindergarten. Keeping him at home will make him bored and "like an old woman". Dressing up their children beautifully and letting them enjoy the happiness of childhood is almost the heart of every parent. Aren't those children on the grass field cute enough? So every time my wife mentions it, I also every</p>

<p>time I agree, but I postpone it, saying that we'll talk about it after another semester. This bad check is very useful for the child. He also looks at the grass field through the window like me, and when he sees something he likes, he blurts out my words, "I'll go to school next semester."</p>
<p>So I also reply casually, "I'll go to school next semester."</p>
<p>I casually closed the window, letting that grass field be separated beyond the low wall.</p>
<h3>One Night at Floating Manor</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>When the boat rowed past Xiaojinshan, I saw that the square pavilion of Diaoyutai, which extended into the water, was already full of water. We tried to pole the boat towards the pavilion and actually poled it to the center of the pavilion. The boatman wanted to take shelter from the rain here, because the boat was already carrying a lot of water. The rain seemed to be getting heavier and heavier. The clouds on top of the white pagoda opposite were the darkest, and lightning and thunder were constantly coming out of there. After staying here for a long time, the boatman told me a story about the boat girl Yinzhen who committed suicide for love:</p>
<p>Yinzhen was a boat-rowing girl outside the north gate. Because her parents forced her to be a concubine to a wealthy merchant in the city, she and her lover, a young farmer, both drowned themselves in "Liu Family Pond".</p>
<p>I was ashamed to be impatient while sheltering from the rain, so I told the boatman to take me to "Floating Manor" not far from here. This was a friend's villa. I thought: Even if the rain doesn't stop until night, it's okay to stay here for one night.</p>
<p>The owner was not at the villa, but fortunately, Uncle Zhang, who was watching the garden, recognized me. That night, I actually stayed at "Floating Manor".</p>
<p>The house I stayed in had a veranda on one side, and outside the veranda was the lake. Because it was too close to the water, there were a lot of mosquitoes. Even though there was a mosquito net, I was still disturbed and couldn't sleep. The owner had never hidden books in this room, so there was nothing to pass the time. I simply didn't light the kerosene lamp that Uncle Zhang brought, but just lowered the mosquito net and sat upright on the bed, listening to the sound of rain on the lotus leaves outside the veranda. Fortunately, the rain got lighter and lighter, gradually going from small to nothing. I poked my head out the window and saw thin clouds flying like smoke, dimly revealing a half-moon, knowing that the rain had stopped. I went out to the veranda, and the lake was actually reflecting a few stars. There were trees dripping water near the veranda, making the night seem very quiet. I walked along the veranda to a rockery and saw that the lights were still flashing in the mountain temple on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>After standing for a long time, I returned to the room. When I walked outside the window, I heard as if someone was in the room. At first, I thought it was a thief, so I walked heavily. Suddenly, a man and a woman ran out in a hurry. In the dim light, I could make out that the woman was wearing a blue jacket and trousers, and had a braid on her head. She was a very young country girl. The man was also young, wearing only a vest, with bare arms. They hurried away, walking down the stone slope in front of the veranda. There was a small boat below, and they rowed away. I was stunned for a long time, and then I suddenly remembered the story of "Liu Family Pond". I couldn't help but feel horrified and quickly returned to the room and lit the lamp. When I opened the mosquito net, I saw that the mattress was messed up. I suddenly understood and couldn't help but laugh. This should be a pair of lovers who often come here for a tryst, maybe they come every night. The owner probably set up a bed here, but doesn't come often. It was their use that made this bed and mosquito net not set up in vain. However, I couldn't help but feel very sorry. I couldn't see the faces of this pair of lovers clearly at the time, but imagining them, they both seemed very cute. I imagined how they come and go by boat every night, and I was very envious of the charm of this water town.</p>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>Pushing open the window, I saw a few poplars and locust trees standing there alone. Whose courtyard has now become deserted and desolate? The tall trunks of the poplars seemed to want to penetrate into the blue sky. The locust trees were not like that, their bodies were a little curved, supporting a large umbrella-like canopy. It was the time when winter had passed and early spring had just arrived. The lush green branches and leaves had grown densely, and the sunlight shed a bright glow, permeating through the sparse shadows and falling on the dense green grass, drawing strands of stripes. Starry wild flowers, purple and white, peeked out their delicate and charming faces from the thatched grass.</p>
<p>What's even more fun is in the early morning. The hazy mist covers the few trees, making it difficult to distinguish what they look like. The cool morning breeze gently sways the branches and leaves, making a low sound. If the sunlight happens to shine obliquely over, and maybe the wind stops a little, then leaning against the window, whether your eyes are closed or open, listening silently, without the noisy clamor of the daytime, only a group of small birds that came here with the spring, chirping and chattering.</p>
<p>Listening carefully, slowly understanding the noisy and mysterious songs, will let your mood be lightly immersed in this mysterious and poetic realm.</p>
<p>At this time, a burst of wild flower fragrance drifted with the wind, assaulting my nostrils and directly reaching my heart. Watching the birds jumping on the grass, sometimes flying up and sometimes landing, singing spring songs in twos and threes, cleverly hiding in the branches and leaves, and arguing happily, will make you feel that everything has a poetic meaning. You listen intently, gradually condensing your thoughts into a dreamlike world. You will remember the fragmented and trivial scenes in the novels you have read in the past, and perhaps you will depict in your mind the protagonists in the story, how they suddenly found the comfort they needed in failure, or imagine the wife of a man who is on a distant expedition, sitting alone in her deep and secluded boudoir, hearing the chirping of the birds, and suddenly triggering a flurry of thoughts...</p>
<p>If you love the freshness of the morning light and take a quiet walk in the woods, then their cries will make you forget everything, the vulgarity and the vagueness of human affairs, still playing out so blindly, you will feel the joy of floating outside the universe.</p>
<p>If you are in a deep sleep, and they quietly walk in front of your eaves, teasing you and singing lively songs, gently waking you up, you will not hate their meddling, but just lie there lazily, savoring the taste left behind by the sweet dreams, perhaps tracing the beautiful illusions of the past, or perhaps savoring the anticipation of your own future.</p>
