<h3>長江貨運根本阻斷</h3>
<p>江陰要塞失陷之後、其封鎖綫共有兩道、査八一二我軍在該處沉下之商輪、計有公平·同華·新銘·寗靜·廣利·醒獅·鯤興·等四十餘艘、又有德勝·威勝·自强等軍艦五艘、在要塞之內江面、又沉有寗海等艦、以致此一段長江水路、阻碍重重、在最近四五日中、日本派飛機將該一段江中、連連投彈轟炸、擬將封鎖之各沉輪先行炸燬、然後再派潛水夫、及工兵等入長江水底、用氧氣等、劃破沉船鋼板、意在先打開水路一道、使海軍中之驅逐艦、小型砲艦等、得以長驅上駛、企圖直逼南京、以遂其陸海空軍包圍進攻首都、且可上駛漢口、此舉在軍事上極關重要、但數日以來、日軍之毁壞江陰封鎖綫、似未能卽時成功、故昨日此間得到消息、日軍已在長江北岸之靖江、（卽江陰對江）設法登陸、該處原有大煤棧碼頭一所、日軍正可利用此碼頭供軍隊登岸之接足點也、此項日本軍隊用小駁船運至該處、然後循靖江方面之公路、到泰興、揚州、以趨浦口、査靖江本駐有我軍、在江陰失陷時、已移往上游段某處扼守、因日軍之在江北上陸、長江貨運交通、頓受打擊、上海往通州之船、雖可照常開航、但運轉至上游貨、已根本阻斷、無法上水、已裝去而無從囤績者、紛紛退回上海、太古怡和之通州輪現專搭旅客、不再運貨、而華義公司之恩德輪、業已停航通州綫、改駛寗波、又蕪湖方面、自日機轟炸英商太古怡和之大通德和兩船事發生以後、原行京漢間之長江輪船、若招商、三北、寗紹、以及民生公司之上下水船、均不敢再到蕪湖、有駛至大通卽便上駛者、卽太古怡和之長江輪、亦不至蕪湖矣、</p>
<h3>政府內容有變更强化軍政組織</h3>
<p>中政會現已告解散　朱毛彭將參加政治　各領袖對目下時局並無虛僞之樂觀</p>
<p>路透社九日上海消息、路透社漢口訪員報稱、政治與政府內容、現日有變更、中政府在名義上雖集中於重慶、但此僅爲紙上具文、今政府民政之組織、實際已漸消滅、而代以軍政組織、成爲蔣軍委長之大本營矣、各院與各部均徒有其名、外交部平時有職員四百餘人、今存者不足五十、立法院僅存院長秘書長與五委員會之主席、中政會因種種原因、已告解散、其他變動、尙在議計中、共產黨領袖朱德·毛澤東·彭德懷迄今僅爲所謂第八路軍之指揮、惟此三人不日將於政府事務更佔活動部份、此項變動、此間華人各界多予歡迎、蓋多年以來、因人的與政治的關係、曾留養軍民政許多冗員、今則已一掃而空之也、川省今後將爲中國之首都、而湘省將爲政府注意之點、如日軍由南京溯江西上、則湘省將爲華軍抗戰之根據地、因其地有鐵路公路接通漢口南昌粵桂滇黔四省也、如中政府决計繼續抗戰、則將在湘省訓練新軍、湘主席何鍵之代以張治中、卽爲該計晝之一部分、中國首都之實在工作、大約將在湘省之衝州進行、其地爲粵漢鐵路間之要邑也、</p>
<p>［漢口］本社記者與中國政府各領袖在漢晤談、並見渠等對於目下之時局、並無虛僞之樂觀或“希冀之思想”、據路透記者所得自由南京來此各政府領袖之印象、覺渠等對於現時絕嚴重之局勢、仍充滿活躍之氣象、“英美或將有所舉動”一語、目下已不復可聞、中國人士對於蘇俄、亦不希望其能有任何立時之援助、彼等雖尙未放棄獲得蘇俄援助之希望、但已明知蘇俄在免去歐洲方面可能的攻擊之前、在遠東不能採取確切之行動、中國各領袖表示對於義大利之態度不再續有疑盧、因其已明白表示爲親日者也、惟中國領袖之中、仍有認德國雖一方面助日、而對華亦予以援助者、蓋德國對於中日皆願修好也、此間各中國當局對於時局均肯坦直而談、據稱目下中國之勝着、仍蘇俄是賴、按在中日啟釁之初期、中政府頗希望英美或出面干預、當時頗有與蘇俄商量之機會、但恐因此或將開罪於英美而廷擱、中蘇不侵犯條約之簽訂、實在中國政府已明知英美援助絕少希望之後也、（九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>外輪兩艘明日儎米到滬</h3>
<p>分配辦法業已商妥　採辦國米發生障礙</p>
<p>雜糧業永大行第二批洋米二萬六千包、及法商達孚洋行第五批洋米二萬五千包、已裝成都輪及瑪格而捷蓀輪、准明日同時抵滬、分配辦法業已商妥、採辦國米發生障碍、南市之米、仍未放行、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>裝米兩輪明日到滬</p>
<p>雜糧業永大行訂購洋米十萬包、第一批二萬包已抵滬、第二批二萬六千包、裝瑪格而捷蓀輪凖明日抵滬、停泊金利源碼頭、第三批二萬九千包、定十五日抵滬、第四批二萬五千包、定二十日抵滬、法商達孚洋行續訂洋米五萬包、分裝兩輪起運、第一艘（卽第五批）裝成都輪、凖明日上午十一時抵滬、停泊法租界外灘浮筒、第二艘（卽第六批）定十六日抵滬、每批均為二萬五千包、</p>
<p>分配辦法業已商妥</p>
<p>昨向米業團體探悉、雜糧業二批洋米分配辦法、由法公董局領取八千包、交米號業公會會員米號法租界二百家零糶、每家派得四十包、撥六千包為救濟難民之用、餘由永大行直接平價售與各米行、㊁法商達孚洋行第五批洋米分配辦法、由米號業公會領取二萬包、交五百家會員米號辦理零糶、每家為四十包、餘五千包歸該洋行直接分配給各救濟難民機關、</p>
<p>公會規定零糶辦法</p>
<p>米號業公會對法商達孚洋行第五批洋米、及雜糧業永大行第二批洋米、領取交會員米號辦理零糶辦法、規定㊀價格每市斤為國幣八分半、㊁每戶至多以國幣一元為限、至於公會領米價格、㊀碼頭交貨每包國幣十六元一角五分、㊁棧房交貨每包國幣十六元四角五分、以上暫收雜費每包二角五分、又公共租界及法租界當局對辦理零糶之米號、整包出售反斤量不足、如為査獲、除停止享受洋米權利外、决予嚴究、</p>
<p>採辦國米發生障礙</p>
<p>昨向雜糧業探悉、該公會會員米行向浙東溫州·台州·寗波·等處採辦國米、經浙省政府核准上海市商會證明後、業已分別派員前往採辦、今各縣為防止糧食資敵、及維持本縣民食起見、不准滬市糧食商鉅額採辦、所以國米之運滬、事實上頗有困難之處、</p>
<p>南市米船交涉無效</p>
<p>南市米船上國米總約二萬担、經各米業團體交涉放行無效後、前日有人允向日方交涉、但至昨晚截止、仍未見放行、又據米業界消息、該項米船、已為日方拖去應差、船上之米均已卸下、堆在浦東棧房內、放行之說、希望甚少、</p>

<h3>浦東警戒綫切勿探望</h3>
<p>浦東賴義渡太古公司棧與陸家嘴隆茂棧兩處圍牆、恒有人由棧內攀牆爬出、回家探望、不知上述兩處、均為日軍警戒綫內之危險地帶、陸續因越牆而被擊斃者、已有四十餘人、昨日午後一時三刻、又有無名男子兩名、在隆茂棧攀牆躍出、當被日軍開槍擊斃、故希嗣後任何入萬勿冒此危險、</p>

        <h1>1937.12.10</h1>
<h3>Fierce Battle in the Suburbs of Beijing: Our Troops Valiantly Defend the Capital</h3>
<p>We will never give up until the last moment.  Qilinmen has been breached, and the front line has been moved back.  Japanese aircraft drop leaflets demanding a reply by noon today.</p>
<p>[Hankou] A Japanese column advancing on Nanjing from the south has broken through the Chinese army's defense line at Molingguan and advanced to Niushoushan, nine miles from Nanjing. Chinese troops are ambushed in the mountains and are fiercely resisting the Japanese army's advance along the Nanjing-Lishui highway toward the southern gate of the capital. Niushoushan is a famous scenic spot near the capital, and residents of Beijing often take cars to the temples in the mountains on weekends during the summer. American Ambassador Johnson, who is currently in Hankou, received a long-distance telephone call from the embassy in Beijing this morning, saying that everything in Beijing is peaceful, except for the sound of artillery fire in the Tangshan area. Those remaining in Beijing are Mr. Atcheson, Mr. Fixter, and Mr. Gaselee. All three spent last night on the American gunboat USS Panay. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to a report from the Nanjing front received here last night, the Japanese army is still in several places outside the city of Nanjing, all of which are still far from the city. Although one Japanese unit is approaching Yuhuatai, it is still several miles away from the south gate. It is reported that the Chinese side here has acknowledged the Japanese occupation of Qixia Mountain and Tangshan. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to an official report released today by the Japanese General Headquarters, Japanese troops have advanced to Qilinmen, five miles east of Zijin Mountain, and another unit has reached a point seven miles south of Nanjing. Fierce fighting is underway between the two sides. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Defended to the Last Moment</h3>
<p>[Hankou] According to Chinese sources here, the Japanese army has crossed the north bank of the Yangtze River from Jiangyin in an attempt to sneak north of Nanjing and encircle the capital. On the other hand, this move shows that the Japanese army's work to clear the sunken ships in the Yangtze River has apparently not been successful, because if the waterway were passable, the Japanese army's attack on Nanjing would be much easier. It is said that China has amassed a large army north of the Yangtze River to prevent the Japanese encirclement plan, and will ensure that the Japanese army cannot reach Pukou, so as to maintain Chinese army's communication with the north of Nanjing as a route for the final retreat. According to foreign military observers here, the Chinese army defending Nanjing will defend it to the last minute before giving it up, but will not defend it to the death with a large number of troops, waiting for the Japanese army's encirclement to succeed and making unnecessary sacrifices. Tang Shengzhi, the Nanjing Garrison Commander, who is known as a resourceful military strategist, said that Nanjing can be defended for at least five more days. It is reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek instructed Mr. Tang to defend Nanjing to the last moment. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to Chinese sources here, Nanjing is still being firmly defended by the Chinese army, and the claim that it has fallen is completely unfounded. They also stated that the Japanese army has certainly not yet invaded the city walls. This news was obtained from a private long-distance telephone call between Nanjing and Hankou this morning. (National News Agency)</p>
<p>External news: Wuxing is now surrounded by our troops. The Japanese army is feeling a great food shortage. There was still fierce fighting in the suburbs near 8:00 AM, and our army has the upper hand on both the front and flanks. The Japanese army in Nanxun is now reinforcing Wuxing and Guangde. There are several Japanese steamships in Xia'angzhen, north of Deqing Luoshe.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Fight Bravely on the Highlands</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, the Japanese army's Sukeawa unit was fiercely attacked by our army defending the mountainous area behind Zijin Mountain, north of Zhuoshui Town, on the afternoon of the 7th, and a fierce battle ensued between the two sides. At the same time, our army firmly guarding the vicinity of Tangshan City launched a brave resistance with mortars and rapid-fire guns. Our army, which built solid permanent positions on the highlands, is the only defense of the capital. Their artillery fire is very accurate, and they are indeed a force to be reckoned with. A certain unit of the Japanese army, in conjunction with the Noda unit, planned a night attack at zero hours on the morning of the 8th, and even more on the right flank, there were Sukeawa, Katahira, and other units, and on the left flank, there was the Ono unit, planning an encirclement.</p>
<h3>City of Nanjing Ablaze</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Nanjing troops are still carrying out defense work amidst the raging fires inside the city and the booming artillery fire outside the city today. Xiaguan, along the river, has always been a densely populated area. All houses that could be used by the enemy have now been set on fire by the troops. All branch roads have now been blocked with sandbags and other objects. Refugees are still carrying their few belongings and moving to safe areas. Tangshan Road has many wounded soldiers coming to the city for treatment, and pack animals carrying munitions and supplies are also constantly on the road. Japanese planes are still bombing Chinese soldiers outside the city, and all villages and towns in the suburbs have been burned down. A Reuters reporter passed through a town where both sides of the road were reduced to ashes, leaving only a few better houses for Chinese soldiers to live in, but when the Chinese soldiers leave in the future, they will still become scorched earth. At the same time, the Chinese military authorities, due to the critical situation, have warned foreigners not to enter Nanjing. The remaining personnel of the British, American, and German embassies in Beijing stayed on British and American warships last night, but still went ashore to work this morning. At present, there are about 20 foreigners staying in Beijing, including news reporters, photographers, and personnel from the safety zone committee. Two British ships and one American ship are anchored in Sanjiahe, about two miles upstream of Xiaguan. It is said that there are still more than 2,000 non-combatant members of the Chinese army staying in the poor areas of the city. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Sources: Advance to Nishimura</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency claims that the Noda and Katahira units captured the fortresses of Tangshan and Dahushan respectively on the 7th and secured the main road to Zhongshan Gate. Last night, some tanks from the Iwanaka Tank Unit entered the Central Army Infantry School in Nishimura before dawn on the 9th. The large school ground and airfield outside Nanjing City were captured by the Japanese army before dawn this morning.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency claims that the Japanese army's Wakita, Fujii, Isa, and Hitomi units participated in the general attack on Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th. After occupying Chunhua, they crossed Ma'anshan at 10:00 PM and approached the Chinese army's position. At this time, more than 500 Chinese soldiers, under the protection of three tanks, counterattacked the Wakita unit. As a result of the fierce battle, the Japanese army occupied Gaoqiaomen, four kilometers from Nanjing, at 4:30 AM on the 9th. When the telegram was sent, the vanguard of the Wakita unit had reached a point two kilometers from Nanjing.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency claims that the Shanghai military authorities announced that the Kataoka, Nozomi, Kosakai, Fujiyama, and Asano units occupied Yangcun (24 li southeast of Wuhu) at noon on the 8th and are advancing further toward Wuhu. The Japanese army units attacking Nanjing are gradually reducing their encirclement line. At noon on the 8th, the Ono and Noda units occupied Qilinmen, and the Okamoto and Takeshita units occupied Meishan.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency claims that the Fujiyama, Nozomi, Kosakai, Kataoka, and other units advancing north from Xuanzhou reached Jia Dian, four kilometers south of Wuhu, at about 10:00 AM on the 9th and began attacking the Chinese army's position in Wuhu. Fires broke out everywhere in Wuhu City, and residents fled in droves.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency claims that the Japanese Air Force dropped a letter of advice from the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, Matsui, to the Nanjing Defense Commander at noon today, demanding a reply before noon on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Freight Transportation Completely Blocked</h3>
<p>After the fall of the Jiangyin Fortress, there were two blockade lines. It was found that on August 12th, our army sank more than 40 merchant ships there, including the Gongping, Tonghua, Xinming, Ningjing, Guangli, Xingshi, Kunxing, etc., as well as five warships, including the Desheng, Weisheng, and Ziqiang. The Ninghai and other ships were also sunk in the river within the fortress, causing heavy obstacles to this section of the Yangtze River waterway. In the past four or five days, Japan has sent planes to bomb this section of the river repeatedly, intending to destroy the sunken ships blocking the waterway first, and then send divers and engineers into the bottom of the Yangtze River to cut through the steel plates of the sunken ships with oxygen, etc., intending to open up a waterway first so that destroyers and small gunboats in the navy can drive straight up, trying to press on Nanjing in order to carry out its land, sea, and air force's encirclement and attack on the capital, and can also drive up to Hankou. This move is extremely important militarily, but for several days, the Japanese army's destruction of the Jiangyin blockade line does not seem to have been immediately successful, so yesterday news was received here that the Japanese army has landed on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jingjiang (that is, opposite Jiangyin), and is trying to find a way to land. There was originally a large coal yard pier there, and the Japanese army can use this pier as a foothold for troops to land. These Japanese troops are transported there by small barges, and then follow the highway in the direction of Jingjiang to Taixing and Yangzhou in order to go to Pukou. It was found that our army was originally stationed in Jingjiang, and when Jiangyin fell, it had moved to a certain place upstream to guard. Because of the Japanese army's landing on the north bank of the Yangtze River, freight traffic on the Yangtze River has been hit hard. Although ships from Shanghai to Tongzhou can operate as usual, the transportation of goods to the upper reaches has been completely blocked and cannot go upstream. Those who have loaded the goods but have nowhere to store them are returning to Shanghai one after another. Taikoo Jardine's Tongzhou ships now only carry passengers and no longer transport goods, while Huayi Company's Ende ship has already suspended its Tongzhou route and changed to Ningbo. Also, in Wuhu, since the incident of Japanese aircraft bombing the British merchant ships Taikoo Jardine's Datong and Dehe, the Yangtze River ships originally traveling between Beijing and Hankou, such as the China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning Shao, and Minsheng companies' ships going up and down the river, dare not go to Wuhu anymore. Those who sail to Datong will then sail upstream, and even Taikoo Jardine's Yangtze River ships will not go to Wuhu.</p>
<h3>Changes in Government Structure to Strengthen Military and Political Organization</h3>
<p>The Central Political Council has been dissolved.  Zhu, Mao, and Peng will participate in politics.  Leaders have no false optimism about the current situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 9th.  Reuters' Hankou correspondent reports that the content of politics and government is changing daily.  Although the central government is nominally concentrated in Chongqing, this is only a formality on paper.  The organization of the government's civil administration is actually gradually disappearing and being replaced by a military and political organization, becoming the headquarters of Chiang Kai-shek's military committee.  The various yuan and ministries are only nominal.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually has more than 400 employees, but now there are fewer than 50.  The Legislative Yuan only has the president, secretary-general, and the chairmen of the five committees.  The Central Political Council has been dissolved for various reasons.  Other changes are still under consideration.  Communist leaders Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai have so far only been the commanders of the so-called Eighth Route Army, but these three will soon occupy a more active part in government affairs.  These changes are welcomed by various circles in the Chinese community here, because for many years, due to personal and political relations, many redundant personnel have been kept in the military, civil, and political sectors, but now they have been swept away.  Sichuan Province will be China's capital in the future, and Hunan Province will be the focus of the government's attention.  If the Japanese army goes up the Yangtze River from Nanjing, Hunan Province will be the base for the Chinese army's resistance, because it has railways and highways connecting Hankou, Nanchang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Qianzhou.  If the central government decides to continue the resistance, it will train new troops in Hunan Province.  The replacement of He Jian, the chairman of Hunan Province, by Zhang Zhizhong is part of this plan.  The actual work of China's capital will probably be carried out in Chongzhou, Hunan Province, which is an important town on the Guangdong-Han Railway.</p>
<p>[Hankou] This agency's reporter met and talked with various leaders of the Chinese government in Hankou, and saw that they had no false optimism or "wishful thinking" about the current situation. According to the impression that Reuters reporters received from various government leaders who came here from Nanjing, they are still full of vitality in the face of the current extremely serious situation. The phrase "Britain and the United States may take action" can no longer be heard now. Chinese people also do not hope that Soviet Russia can provide any immediate assistance. Although they have not given up hope of obtaining Soviet Russian assistance, they already know that Soviet Russia cannot take concrete action in the Far East before avoiding possible attacks from Europe. Chinese leaders said that they no longer have any doubts about Italy's attitude, because it has clearly expressed that it is pro-Japanese. However, among the Chinese leaders, there are still those who believe that although Germany is helping Japan on the one hand, it is also providing assistance to China, because Germany is willing to maintain good relations with both China and Japan. The Chinese authorities here are willing to talk frankly about the current situation. It is said that China's best move at the moment is still to rely on Soviet Russia. According to reports, at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the central government had hoped that Britain and the United States would come forward to intervene. At that time, there was a good opportunity to discuss with Soviet Russia, but it was postponed for fear of offending Britain and the United States. The signing of the Sino-Soviet non-aggression treaty was really after the Chinese government had clearly realized that there was little hope of assistance from Britain and the United States.

<h3>Cannon Fodder Occurred in Xiamen</h3>
<p>One Japanese warship hit and injured. Japanese soldiers on Sanzhao Island have increased again.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Japanese warships attacked Xiamen on the 6th and 8th, firing dozens of shells. We also opened fire to counterattack. One Japanese warship was hit and injured and is about to sink. The rest fled. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The number of Japanese soldiers on Sanzhao Island, Zhongshan, has increased to 600. They are building works and piers. Strong men retreat to the mountains to resist the war. Japan is also planning to occupy islands such as Gaolan Village, Da Ning Shan, and Da Lin Shan to connect with Hebao Bay and threaten Zhongshan. The intention to invade south is expanding day by day. The Japanese soldiers on Chuanshan Island under the jurisdiction of Taishan have not yet withdrawn. The fires on Qingchong Mountain and the mountains behind Shadi have been extinguished by our army and people. Shengsi Island near Shangchuan has been occupied by Japan, and Japanese soldiers have also landed in Shajing. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Guerrillas on the Pinghan Railway Briefly Recapture Matou Town</h3>
<p>There was fierce artillery fire in Jinan.</p>
<p>[Beiping] News received here from the Chinese side today: Chinese guerrillas north of the Zhang River on the Pinghan Railway have launched brave attacks for days and briefly recaptured Matou Town, seizing many military supplies. They retreated after a large number of Japanese troops arrived. Most of the Japanese troops on the front line of the Pinghan Railway are cavalry, and their strength is very weak. If the Chinese army can unite with the guerrillas in various parts of southern Hebei and launch a large-scale counterattack, it will not be difficult to recover the lost land in southern Hebei and northern Henan. (Express News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] According to news obtained here from the Chinese side, there was fierce artillery fire in Jinan again from 7:30 PM last night, but it stopped after two hours. From a general observation, this move by the Japanese army is purely exploratory. The Japanese army will not launch an offensive on the south bank of the Yellow River until after it has captured Nanjing. (Express News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Japanese troops on the right wing and front of the Pinghan Railway have increased slightly. There are occasional small contacts near Anyang. The guerrillas of our various units north of the Zhang River recently launched a night attack on Cixian Railway Station from a certain town, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers and seizing countless weapons and ammunition. A part of the Japanese army fled to Gaoyi. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Three Japanese planes flew to Taian on the morning of the 8th to scout, and flew low near Taian, strafing with machine guns. We suffered no damage. Also, two Japanese planes flew from the direction of Zhucheng on the morning of the 8th and attacked the Jinpu Railway, dropping four bombs at Shahe Station, destroying one coal car and two sections of railway track. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Military news: The Japanese troops at Yancheng Station on the north bank of the Yellow River transported more than 70 small speedboats and collected wood in the villages near the station to make them. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack the Capital, Nanchang: Fierce Air Battle Occurs</h3>
<p>Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Han Railways were bombed.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Shanghai, 9th. The main force of the Japanese Army Air Force's Kawamura, Takashi, and Kawasaki units departed from their bases before dawn this morning to bomb Nanjing. Before long, the Naval Air Force also participated in the battle, dropping bombs, and the sound of the explosions was very dense. The number of bombs dropped seemed to be quite large.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Local, 9th. The Japanese Army Naval Air Force, under the command of Majors Ohbayashi and Mihara, bombed the Chinese Air Force base far away in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, this afternoon, destroying the elite of the Chinese Air Force that was preparing to take off and damaging more than 20 aircraft. They then engaged in fierce combat in the air with more than 20 Chinese Air Force aircraft, 16 of which were shot down by the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] When Japanese planes raided Nanchang this afternoon, they were extremely frightened by the brave pursuit of our air force, so they wantonly dropped bombs on the women's hospital and civilian areas affiliated to the medical school. According to police statistics, 79 civilians were killed or injured by the bombing, and 66 houses were destroyed. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 8:10 AM on the 9th, five Japanese planes flew from Tangjiawan to the Guangdong-Yue Railway via the province, dropping dozens of bombs on Yuantan, Lidong, Pajiang, and Shakou. At the same time, five Japanese planes flew over the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and dropped more than a dozen bombs on Tutang and Tiantangwei, destroying a lot of railway tracks. Midnight trains were all stopped. At 12:30 PM, five Japanese planes again attacked the Guangdong-Yue Railway. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 4:00 PM on the 9th, four Japanese planes attacked the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway three times, dropping more than a dozen bombs on Tiantangwei. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] This morning, Japanese planes dropped 15 bombs on Chengmotou (transliteration) Station, causing considerable damage. Train traffic between Hong Kong and Guangzhou has been temporarily suspended as a result. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Eighteen American Nationals Firmly Remain in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Prepare ropes in case of emergency.</p>
<p>[Washington] According to news received here from Shanghai, there are fifteen men and three women among the American nationals in Nanjing. Although they have been repeatedly urged to move elsewhere, they have decided to stay in Beijing and not leave. They have now prepared ropes to use to rappel from the city wall if the city is breached. According to the latest news from China, there is scattered fighting in the mountains around Nanjing. The real war has not yet begun. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department has just received a report from Nanjing stating that there are still 18 American nationals there, including three women. The American gunboat "USS Panay" is still anchored in the river to carry and send these nationals away when necessary. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>The English-language newspaper "China Press" reported that there are still 14 American clergymen and several news reporters in the besieged city of Nanjing today. Most reporters are expected to leave the city and board the American gunboat "USS Panay" at the last minute, but most of the clergymen have notified the American authorities that they will not leave the city no matter how dangerous the situation is. Most of the clergymen are men, and most of them are doctors. Fei Wusheng, a famous doctor from Shanghai, is also among them, but there are three single women among them. The reporters staying in the city are reporters from the New York Times, Associated Press, Reuters, World News Photography, etc. It is said that Mr. McDonnell of the Associated Press and Mr. Arre of World News Photography plan to stay in the city for a long time. The rest plan to board the gunboat when things get urgent. Officials of the American Embassy have already left the city. Other officials, reporters, clergymen, etc., have mostly set off for Hankou and other places.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Government Orders to Conserve Financial and Material Resources</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Jiangxi Provincial Government has ordered all counties to conserve financial and material resources, and encouraged farmers to cut mountain grass for fuel. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul-General Requests Foreign Nationals to Leave Beijing</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that last night (8th), Japanese Consul-General Okamoto sent a letter to the Norwegian Consul-General Alr, the leader of the consular corps, formally requesting that foreign nationals in Nanjing leave immediately to avoid being affected, and asked him to convey the request to all relevant members of the consular corps. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy also stated last night that the Japanese authorities considered those who moved into the so-called safety zone in Nanjing to have taken a risk. Although the Japanese army did not want to attack any area defended by Chinese troops, the Japanese army could not guarantee that stray bullets would not hit the refugee area given the situation in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Simulated a Blackout Last Night</h3>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:50 PM, a squadron of our air force flew over Shanghai, at an altitude of over 5,000 feet. The sound of the planes was very faint, but the speed was extremely fast. Four or five bombs were dropped in the Yulin Road area of Yangshupu. At the same time, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River fired more than a dozen anti-aircraft guns. The people of Shanghai heard and saw everything clearly. That place is a Japanese military depot. The extent of the damage is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Spokesman for Our Foreign Ministry States that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Has Not Retired</h3>
<p>He will never give up the great task of leading the country. Chiang Baili also solemnly refuted rumors in Berlin.</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who met with a representative of the National News Agency here, General Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, has absolutely no intention of resigning. At this time of national crisis and survival, Mr. Chiang is determined to continue to shoulder the heavy burden. The spokesman strongly stated that Chairman Chiang will never give up the great task of leading the country, both now and in the future. (National News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the rumors of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's resignation, General Chiang Baili, a confidant of Mr. Chiang, met with a reporter from the National News Agency here today and made an important statement. Mr. Chiang stated that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang has delegated administrative power to Wang Jingwei and Zhang Qun, and military management power to Cheng Qian and Bai Chongxi, while retaining the final decision-making power over all military, political, and technical matters. General Chiang Baili believes that the rumors of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's resignation were caused by the appointment of these leaders in charge of military and political affairs. It must be known that the issue of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's resignation cannot be decided by Mr. Chiang alone, but must be decided by the people of China. Since the people of China have entrusted Chairman Chiang with this important task, Mr. Chiang's resignation must be approved by public opinion before it can be done. Mr. Chiang Baili continued that even if Nanjing is occupied by the Japanese army, China should continue to resist for a long time. The fighting in Shanghai has fully demonstrated the Chinese army's heroic resistance to defend every inch of land and never yield until death. If Nanjing's resistance is not as strong as Shanghai's, it is only due to strategic considerations to lure the Japanese army deep into the interior and exhaust them. (National News Agency)</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Talks About Peace</p>
<p>⊙Frankfurt: Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, met with a special correspondent of the "Frankfurter Zeitung" today and made a statement. Regarding the current talk of peace, Mr. Kong believes that this is purely an event to be decided by the Japanese side. The correspondent continued that Mr. Kong did not elaborate on the possible details of future negotiations, only mentioning that Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru had told an American reporter that if China accepted the peace agreement, the victorious Japan would offer generous terms, and that what Japan longed for was to provide economic assistance for China's construction. According to the correspondent, Mr. Kong expressed considerable doubt about the issue of economic assistance. The correspondent concluded that the general opinion of the Chinese people is deeply afraid that accepting any proposals from Japan is tantamount to completely surrendering in reality, and that China's political and economic affairs will be completely dominated by Japan in the future.

<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi will Follow the Central Government to the End, Never Changing Their Attitude</h3>
<p>If Japan Invades Southern China, 100,000 Troops Will be Needed; Guangdong Troops are Certain to Hold the Humen Fortress</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Guangdong Chairman Wu Tiecheng told a Reuters reporter today that if Nanjing falls, Southern China intends to redouble its efforts to support the central government. Mayor Zeng Yangfu also stated that "We are part of the central government and are prepared to follow the central government and resist until the end." The statements of these two officials, along with those of the local business community, sufficiently reflect the public sentiment in Guangzhou. Rumors that Guangdong province will break away from the central government are viewed as laughable. It is said that Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have always been the center of the anti-Japanese movement and are now actively preparing for a long-term war of resistance. They will never be discouraged by the Japanese army's victories in North China and the Yangtze River basin. The rumor that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek may step down is not taken seriously here, and Chiang is still highly trusted. Even if Chiang steps down, Southern China will not change its attitude or reconcile with Japan. In the past, Guangxi province's attitude towards the central government was ambiguous, but now it seems to be one of the most enthusiastic patriotic provinces. According to reliable news from Chinese and foreign travelers, Guangxi province has sent tens of thousands of troops this time and a large number of military supplies are being transported north every day. In the current situation, Guangxi province is fully loyal to Chairman Chiang and firmly believes in Bai Chongxi. It is generally believed that even if other Chinese leaders change their attitudes, Bai will continue to resist. There is no atmosphere of defeat in Southern China. As for the actual battles, they have been relatively smooth so far. However, according to unconfirmed rumors, if the war extends to Southern China, it is planned to move the command headquarters or even other administrative organs to a certain location on the border of Guangdong province. Recently, there have been occasional rumors that the Japanese army intends to land in Southern China, causing panic among the people in the province. However, this panic has proven to be completely unfounded. Although public opinion is divided, most people believe that the Japanese army is currently busy fighting in North China and will not have the strength to extend the war to Southern China. Bombing of the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Guangdong-Hankou railways is certainly to be expected, as the Japanese army is trying to make its blockade effective. However, it is generally felt that after the fall of Nanjing, the Japanese army's second objective will be Hankou, with Guangzhou being secondary. The military situation in Southern China remains secret and difficult to ascertain, but according to reliable sources, if the Japanese army attempts to attack Humen, the military strength of Guangdong province is sufficient to cope with it. A foreign military expert stated that if Japan wants to wage war successfully in Southern China, it will need at least 100,000 troops. It is believed that Japan does not currently have the strength for this. Although Guangzhou's naval power is almost non-existent, the entrances of the two main rivers have been blocked, leaving only narrow passages for merchant ships to enter and exit. It is said that gun emplacements have been built at various strategic locations between Guangzhou and the Humen forts as a defense. Southern China's willingness to assist the central government is admirable, but well-informed foreigners still doubt whether it can do so. The Humen fortress, though able to be defended by the troops of Yu Hanmou, and prevent the enemy from passing through. Moreover, the rainy season will soon end, which is more favorable to the Chinese side. If the Japanese army attempts to invade Guangdong province, it must advance from Taiwan and land in Shantou to attack Guangzhou. However, it is generally believed that before the situation in the Yangtze River basin becomes clear, Japan's intentions towards Southern China remain an open question. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] According to news received here, the Japanese navy has landed on Taishan Island on the southern coast of China near Guangzhou. Rumors say the Japanese army plans to seize Guangzhou and other important ports such as Shantou, Fuzhou, and Xiamen. The authorities in Fujian and Guangdong provinces have been actively deploying defenses and increasing military equipment. Guangxi is also recruiting a large number of new soldiers.

<h3>Large-Scale Inspection in the Public Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>Traffic Slightly Delayed; Intended to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, around 6:20 PM, the Public Concession, in the area west of Shandong Road, east of Zhejiang Road, south of Guangdong Road, and north of Avenue Edward VII, conducted a large-scale inspection of pedestrians on the roads and public places in that section, carried out by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Reserve Unit, together with police detectives. At that time, traffic in the area was slightly delayed due to the inspection. In addition, places such as the Shenzhou Hotel and the Central Hotel were thoroughly searched. This operation lasted until 7:30 PM, and then was extended to Shandong Road and the Bund for similar inspections. However, because the search was thorough, the defenses were strict, and it was a surprise operation, nearby residents were surprised and suspicious. After learning the reason, they were relieved, as the Concession authorities had to be more vigilant to maintain security within the Concession.</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the arrest of Chinese people by Japanese police in the Shanghai Public Concession last week, officials recently announced that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive has protested to the Japanese government. Regarding this matter, the Shanghai Municipal Council had already protested to the Shanghai Consular Body. Now the British government is also engaging with the Japanese government, with the purpose of supporting the Municipal Council. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Our Guerrilla Troops Active in Sijing</h3>
<p>Bloody Battles in Sheshan and Tongshi Village; Japanese Army Seems to be Preparing to Encircle</p>
<p>According to someone who left Sijing the day before yesterday (8th), detoured through Pudong, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, our guerrilla troops are extremely active in Sijing. At the same time, the area around Sijing is occupied by several thousand of our guerrilla troops, who are attacking the Japanese army in all directions. The Japanese army is currently dispatching troops from Songjiang, Xinqiao, Xinzhuang, Qibao and other places, and seems to be preparing to encircle. The details are as follows: According to the source, after our army withdrew from Songhu due to strategic considerations, Sijing also fell. Our troops stationed in the Sijing area were ordered to carry out guerrilla warfare, including small units from the 22nd, 55th, 61st, and 88th Divisions, as well as the entire 45th Brigade and Independent Brigade, under the command of Commander He of the Independent Brigade, totaling about 4,000 to 5,000 people. They are active in the vicinity of Xinqiao and Sijing, well-organized, and prepared to shed their last drop of blood in a heroic sacrifice. They are currently stationed in certain locations southeast of Sijing and northwest of Xinqiao. Xinqiao was still in the hands of these loyal and brave guerrilla troops a week ago, but has now been occupied by the Japanese army. The first surprise attack by the guerrilla troops was the bloody battle in Sheshan and Tongshi Village, west of Sijing. On the night of the 10th of last month, 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers in civilian clothes suddenly moved from Songjiang through Sheshan towards Qingpu. Our guerrilla troops discovered this and rushed to attack in the dark. The Japanese soldiers in civilian clothes used more than ten machine guns to fire at our guerrilla troops in a panic. Our army charged into the mountains with hand grenades and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The heroic sacrifices of our guerrilla troops reached 500 to 600 people, and the Japanese army also suffered considerable casualties. Later, on the night of the 11th of last month, another attack was launched on the Japanese army in Tongyou Village near Sheshan. In this battle, Zhu Pinlian, an instructor from the 2nd District, led more than 100 guerrilla troops to intercept 200 Japanese soldiers and an armored vehicle heading west, and another bloody battle ensued. In this battle, our guerrilla troops suffered more than 60 casualties, and one Japanese armored vehicle was damaged by a hand grenade. Subsequently, Japanese cavalry and infantry squads were discovered by our guerrilla troops in Gucunjing, south of Sijing, and were surrounded by our army. Afterwards, skirmishes occurred from time to time with the Japanese troops in Qibao, Tangqiao, and Xinzhuang. On the morning of the 6th of this month, more than 30 of our guerrilla troops encountered 20 Japanese cavalry soldiers between Zhuanqiao and Tangqiao on the Zhuan-She Highway, and another engagement occurred. However, in the past two or three days, the Japanese army has been increasing its troops in Qibao, Xinzhuang, Xinqiao, Songjiang and other areas, and seems to be preparing to encircle our guerrilla troops there.</p>

<h3>Third-Party Ships Should Withdraw from the Yangtze River War Zone</h3>
<p>Japanese Authorities Issue Statement</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that this morning (9th), the Japanese army issued a statement through consular and diplomatic channels, stating that from now on, it will not be responsible for any third-party ships and transportation equipment in the Yangtze River war zone and warning foreigners to pay attention to the dangers to their interests. This was announced by a spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy when he met with news reporters this morning. The statement also requested foreigners to keep their government-owned or other-owned ships and transportation equipment as far away as possible from Chinese troops stationed or moving and Chinese military installations. If possible, they should withdraw from the war zone completely to cooperate with the Japanese army. Otherwise, the Japanese army cannot guarantee the safety of ships and transportation equipment of third countries and their people, and the Japanese army will not be responsible for accidents.</p>

<h3>Various Foreign Shipping Companies Gradually Resume Shanghai Sailings</h3>
<p>Java, Taikoo, Jardine, and French Companies Have Already Implemented; British, Dairen, American, and Italian Companies are Starting to Prepare</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, various foreign shipping companies operating between Shanghai and European ports suspended sailings on the Shanghai routes. This has been the case for more than three months. Now, with the changing war situation, shipping companies are gradually seeking to restore the original situation, and several have already done so. A special investigation of the situation is provided below.</p>
<p>Companies that have resumed Shanghai sailings:</p>
<p>The shipping companies that have resumed Shanghai sailings include the French Postal Shipping Company. The route runs from Shanghai, through Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, Colombo, Djibouti, Port Said, and to Marseilles. Recently, the giant ship *Cintra Boute* is scheduled to set sail from the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf at 10:00 AM on the 11th. Java Postal Shipping Company's ships have also gradually resumed Far East routes. The *Zhisun Dali* is departing from Shanghai yesterday for Xiamen, Hong Kong, Java, and other ports, also carrying small Luzon goods. Cargo ships of the North German Lloyd have arrived in Shanghai, and fast passenger ships are said to be arriving soon. Cargo ships of Taikoo and Jardine companies are also gradually coming to Shanghai to load goods. The large shipments of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai this time are mostly carried by these companies' cargo ships.</p>
<p>Companies Preparing to Resume Shanghai Sailings:</p>
<p>The shipping companies that have started to prepare to resume Shanghai sailings include all the commercial ships of the British Shipping Company that operated on the Shanghai routes before the outbreak of the Shanghai war. It has now been decided to resume operations to transport goods. It is said that its first commercial ship to arrive in Shanghai will be the *Laputa*, which is scheduled to enter Wusong Port on January 7th next year. As for the *Queen* of the Changxing Shipping Company, the *President* of the Dairen Company, and the giant ships of the American and Italian Postal Shipping Companies, no ships have arrived in Shanghai since the start of the Shanghai war until recently. According to the reporter's investigation, these companies are considering gradually resuming operations in mid-January next year, but a final decision will depend on how the situation develops. The Shanghai branches of these companies are very eager for their headquarters to resume Shanghai sailings as soon as possible, as they receive several inquiries every day from Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Frequent Traffic on Coastal Shipping</p>
<p>Foreign shipping companies are seeing increasingly frequent traffic on coastal and North-South Pacific shipping routes. The Shanghai-Ningbo route of the China-Italy Company's *Sidede* and *Deping* and the Taikoo Company's *New Beijing*, the Shanghai-Tongzhou route of the Taikoo Company's *Wuhu* and *Wuxue* and the Jardine Company's *Pinghe* and *Tonghe*, and the S.S. *Misbael Jebsen* of the Ewo Company operating to Xinghua, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, Haikou, Beihai, Haiphong, and other places are all seeing frequent traffic. Passenger and cargo transport is also quite crowded, so Chinese and foreign trade is gradually becoming active.</p>
<p>Shipping Above Tongzhou Interrupted</p>
<p>Since the ships of the British Taikoo and Jardine companies operating on the Shanghai-Tongzhou route switched to irregular sailings, carrying passengers only and temporarily suspending cargo loading, the reporter inquired with the shipping industry yesterday and learned that shipping on the Zhenjiang-Nanjing and Nanjing-Wuhu sections has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, the method of loading cargo onto small general-purpose ships and transferring it to Zhenjiang has been stopped. Passengers wishing to transfer from Tongzhou to Beijing-Hankou can no longer travel by water, and land routes are quite circuitous. However, the Shanghai-Tongzhou routes are still operating as usual, with the *Wuhu* scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tongzhou on the 12th.</p>
<p>No Date Set for Resumption of Inland River Routes</p>
<p>The Beisuzhou Road Yuantong Inland River Shipping Bureau has been suspending operations on various inland river routes since the start of the war, and it will soon be four months. The Bureau, considering that there is no prospect of resuming operations, has decided to downsize. The company's warehouse, originally located at No. 498 Lane on Beisuzhou Road, has now been closed as of today. Yesterday, it also notified all cargo owners to retrieve their stored goods within two weeks (before the 24th of this month), after which they will be auctioned off in order to close down as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Hold Imperial Conference to Decide China Policy</h3>
<p>Ishii and Yoshida Visit Eden and Cadogan; Japan-U.S. Relations Will Become Tense Again; U.S. Interior Secretary Gives Frank Speech</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan's future policy towards China must be decided with a prudent attitude in order to achieve the final goal. Strong opinions have recently arisen within the government and other related parties, advocating holding an imperial conference to decide the fundamental policy towards China. (Domei dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Army Minister Sugiyama met with Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Hirota, who were attending the House of Peers, in a separate room at the Prime Minister's residence from 10:50 AM on the 9th. The three ministers sat together and had various discussions on important current issues. Prior to this, Army Minister Sugiyama also had various discussions with Military Affairs Bureau Chief Machijiri at the official residence at 10:00 AM on the 9th. (Domei dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] Japanese Ambassador to the UK Shigeru Yoshida met with British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan for more than an hour at 11:00 AM this morning. It is said to be related to the Sino-Japanese problem. (Domei dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] Privy Councillor Viscount Ishii was accompanied by Japanese Ambassador to the UK Shigeru Yoshida this afternoon to visit Foreign Secretary Eden, who granted them an audience. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden rejected the suggestion of Labour MP McEntee in the House of Commons today, asking the government to take the opportunity of the visit of Japanese goodwill envoy Viscount Ishii to London to ask him to explain Japan's repeated attacks on British people or military personnel in China and to express regret. Eden replied that, as far as he knew, Ishii had stated that his visit to Europe was purely private in nature, so McEntee's request to lodge a protest with him was out of the question. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, someone raised a question to the government regarding the mission of Japanese Privy Councillor Viscount Ishii's visit to the UK. Foreign Secretary Eden replied, "As far as I know, Ishii has said that his trip to Europe is purely private in nature. Therefore, it is not appropriate to discuss with him the attacks on British soldiers in Shanghai and the damage to the property of British expatriates." Opposition Labour MP Henderson then mentioned Italy's violation of the League of Nations resolution and recognition of "Manchukuo," advocating that the British government should take appropriate action to support the protest lodged by the Chinese government. The Foreign Secretary replied, "I am well aware that Italy's move is contrary to the report unanimously adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly on February 24, 1933. However, according to the content of the Chinese government's protest, other countries do not seem to need to take action." Regarding the Shanghai Customs issue, the Foreign Secretary said, "After the United Kingdom, the United States, and France made representations to the Japanese government, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota told the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, that the Japanese government would consider the views of the countries concerned." At the same time, the authorities concerned in Shanghai are still in negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden replied in the House of Commons today regarding the question of the League of Nations Far East Advisory Committee, recalling that the chairman of the committee had previously stated that he intended to convene a meeting again at an appropriate time to review the work of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and record any suggestions made to or by the members of the committee. As far as he knows, no government has suggested reconvening the meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Political commentators here indicated today that the Japanese occupation of Nanjing will have a serious impact on U.S.-Japan relations. Japan may take the opportunity to test the waters for a peace treaty as a victor. However, because Japan seeks to obtain commercial and economic benefits through military victories, U.S.-Japan relations will inevitably become tense. The United States will strongly protest to Japan for its open-door policy. Secretary of State Hull will instruct consuls to submit detailed reports on Japan's plans to manage Chinese customs and reduce tariffs on large quantities of Japanese goods. However, U.S. officials are unwilling to express the extent to which the U.S. government can take action. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Pan-American Conference hosted by the University of Washington recently continued its meeting today. Carlson, the negotiator for the U.S. and foreign power companies (the Shanghai Power Company is affiliated with the company), delivered a speech saying, "After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the mutual relations between the United States and other countries in the Americas should be strengthened. Regardless of who wins in Shanghai, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom will all suffer damage. Since the Shanghai market has been hit, the Latin American markets will become a place for countries to compete. Therefore, the U.S. business community must step up its efforts to occupy a leading position in Latin America and not fall behind." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[New York] U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes said in a speech at the American Civil Liberties Union banquet last night that the new madness of countries wearing nightgowns is now posing a greater threat to the United States. Ickes compared the modern era to the era of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States, saying that Ku Klux Klan members are now speeding through the international battlefield in bombers, tanks, warships, and submarines. Countries that are weak, helpless, and rich in natural resources are regarded as the birthplace of communism. This is incredible, so these countries must be preserved to prevent them from becoming the charred wood burned by some profit-driven fanatics. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[New York] Interior Secretary Ickes gave a radio address at a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union today, strongly stating that dictatorial countries have endangered democratic countries. Even the most solid democratic political systems must be careful to prevent their freedom from being taken away. These dictatorial countries claim to benefit themselves and others, but they are actually using the name of eliminating communism to commit atrocities that even barbaric peoples would be ashamed to do. Those who are now trying to undermine the democratic political system in the United States are also using these names. (National Telegraph dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>China's Silver in the UK is Now Being Refined into Large Bars</h3>
<p>Facilitating Loans from British Banks to China; It Will Not Be Sold on the London Market</p>
<p>[London] A London newspaper reported this morning that China's silver currently stored in London is being refined by a silver refinery on behalf of the U.S. Treasury Department. This has been firmly denied by the refinery. A Reuters reporter was informed that it is actually being refined by the Chinese government. Bullion dealers are not afraid that the silver refined here will be sold in London, because according to the silver agreement signed between the Chinese government and the British government, any silver must be purchased by the U.S. Treasury Department first. Even if the United States stops buying, it is impossible for Chinese silver to be sold in London, because the appearance of the first ounce of Chinese silver on the London market would be enough to cause a slump. As for the reason why the Chinese government is refining silver, it is generally believed that it is to facilitate loans from British banks to the Chinese government. Moreover, storing large bars is more convenient and cheaper than storing silver coins and broken silver. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The International Silver Agreement was established in 1933, and its term will expire at the end of this year. U.S. representative Signatory and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Pittman, stated that when this agreement was established, the United States originally hoped that the national banks of the signatory countries would all mint silver coins. This has not been put into practice, which is disappointing. Part of the reason is due to the poor international political situation. However, if other related countries want to establish a new agreement, the United States is willing to negotiate. However, given the situation in the major silver exporting countries, China and Spain, even if a new agreement is established, it will be difficult to produce practical results. As for the current silver policy of the United States, it will not be changed. The government will continue to purchase foreign silver at world market prices and purchase domestic silver at the price stipulated by President Roosevelt. Regarding this matter, U.S. officials also stated that according to the "Silver Purchase Act," the Treasury Department can still purchase large quantities of silver as monetary reserves, until it reaches two-thirds of the gold reserve. At present, it is only one-fifth of the gold reserve. According to this calculation, the United States still needs to purchase 900,000,000 yuan of silver in order to reach the gold-to-silver ratio of three to one. (Havas dispatch, 8th) Recently, the London silver price suddenly plummeted and the currency price fell sharply. The trend seems to be similar to the New York silver trend in the spring of 1935 and the winter of 1934. Recently, the London silver market has suddenly fallen again. Everyone is uneasy about the extent of the British silver market next spring. Inquiries were made to the banking community, and it was reported that the London silver market trend has no real impact on our monetary system. After we adopted the legal tender in the winter of 1935, we have broken away from the silver standard. Therefore, the rise and fall of silver prices have no major relationship with our reserves of gold and silver. Moreover, since last year, our country has sold the silver that should have been sold at high prices, which is more than 400,000,000 yuan. Therefore, no matter how the silver price changes, our monetary system will have no impact.</p>
<h3>Business Circles in Japan Advocate Continuing the War</h3>
<p>Despite Military Success, the Goal Remains Distant</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that business circles in Osaka advocate inflicting a fatal blow on China to prevent the resurgence of anti-Japanese movements and eliminate both the pro-Communist and pro-British/American factions. The newspaper further quotes the president of Kanebo Spinning, Shingo Tsuda, on this matter, stating that the fall of Nanjing can be considered a significant military achievement. However, from an economic standpoint, it is still far from Japan's ultimate goal. Japanese business circles hope that the Japanese army will continue the war to eliminate the various roots of evil still present in Hankou and Guangzhou. It is essential that Hankou be detached from the Soviet Union and Guangzhou from Britain. Even if Britain lodges a protest with Tokyo, Japan need not worry about Britain, he said. The newspaper also quotes the president of Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Shozo Murata, as saying that we must not be satisfied with the fall of Nanjing. Behind China, there are still enemies. To defeat them, we must have even stronger military and economic power. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Three French Warships Arrive in the Far East</h3>
<p>Reports of British Fleet Concentration Unconfirmed</p>
<p>⊙Algiers A squadron of French warships, consisting of three of the latest armored cruisers, led by Rear Admiral Godefroy, has set sail for the Far East today after conducting exercises off the coast of French Algeria in Africa. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] Rumors that various warships belonging to the British Pacific Fleet and the Far East Fleet are concentrating in Chinese waters have been denied by naval circles here. It is said that the British warships currently stationed in Chinese waters are limited to the China Fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Little, which includes three first-class cruisers, two light cruisers, fifteen submarines, one mine-laying ship, one aircraft carrier, one destroyer squadron, five gunboats, and fifteen shallow-draft gunboats. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Italy Decides to Withdraw from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>[Rome] The Italian government has decided to withdraw from the League of Nations immediately. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Officials have announced that the Fascist Grand Council will convene a meeting on the 11th of this month, and all decisions made at the meeting will be announced to the entire nation immediately. It is reported that the recent rumors of Italy withdrawing from the League of Nations may be related to the meeting of the Fascist Grand Council. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Italian sources in Geneva admit that Italy will announce its withdrawal from the League of Nations on Saturday or Sunday. The League of Nations, on the other hand, is relieved by Italy's withdrawal. However, among the seven major powers, only Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will uphold the League of Nations Covenant in Geneva. It is likely that Italy will exert pressure in the future to induce some smaller countries to revolve around the German-Italian axis and break away from the League of Nations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Customs Issues Discussed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>British Parliament Discusses Hong Kong</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the Chinese customs issue is still under discussion with the authorities in Shanghai. He has not yet received information on the attitudes of the French and American governments after receiving replies to this issue. Labour MP Henderson asked who is keeping the customs duties paid on goods currently entering China. The Foreign Secretary replied that Henderson should submit a written inquiry. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] In the House of Commons today, a Liberal government opposed to the government, MP Chad, requested the government to guarantee the defense of Hong Kong under all circumstances. The British Foreign Secretary replied, "The British government has repeatedly stated that it will defend British territories wherever they may be. You should have known this long ago." Labour MP Fletcher then asked for the latest information regarding the organization and position of the Japanese naval and air forces near Hong Kong. Eden replied that he had nothing to say on the matter. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] During today's meeting of the House of Commons, the Overseas Trade Minister Hudson denied Japanese claims that Britain would ship poison gas to China. This was in response to a question by Labour MP McEntee, who asked if the Department of Commerce was aware of a report by the Japanese news agency that twelve tons of poison gas had been shipped from Britain to China. Hudson replied that since the beginning of this year, no poison gas had been exported from Britain, except for three tons of gas supplied to a paint factory in the Netherlands. Another MP said that the Japanese news agency's report originated from Paris. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the Shanghai Japanese authorities have not yet rescinded the regulations restricting British residents who wish to enter the Japanese-occupied areas of the Public Settlement for their families or offices. According to recent information from the British representative in Shanghai, although these restrictions should have been lifted long ago, the Japanese authorities have not yet announced a reopening date. The British authorities are now working hard to urge the Japanese authorities to issue an order to reopen the Japanese-occupied areas. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Romania's Government and People Welcome the French Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Discussions Result in Complete Satisfaction; French Foreign Minister Scheduled to Visit Yugoslavia</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest, Romania The arrival of French Foreign Minister Delbos in the Romanian capital yesterday from Poland has generated great satisfaction among the Romanian people. He is seen as carrying a mission of peace. Major political parties regard Delbos as representing the democratic countries, since Romania looks to Britain and France for its political and economic interests. Therefore, Delbos's visit is considered highly important. After arriving in Bucharest, Delbos had lunch with King Carol, followed by meetings with several cabinet members. The French Foreign Minister's reciprocal visit to Romania coincides with intense political strife due to the general election on the 20th of this month. The opinions of the various political parties are largely related to the government's domestic policies. National sentiment is running high, with three people killed and dozens arrested today in various locations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>⊙Bucharest, Romania French Foreign Minister Delbos held a second meeting with Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu this afternoon. Afterwards, he met with Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu at the French Embassy. Although the content of the two meetings is unknown, they are generally considered very important. It is reported that they discussed Central European issues, while promoting commercial, military, and cultural relations will be discussed tomorrow. It is also generally believed that after Foreign Minister Delbos's talks with the Romanian authorities, it has been proven that the Romanian government still adheres to the principles enshrined in the League of Nations Covenant and has decided to support the collective security system. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>⊙Belgrade, Yugoslavia French Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to visit here at 9:00 AM on the 12th of this month. He will first visit Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, then meet with First Regent Prince Paul at noon, and call on the Queen Mother in the afternoon. In the evening, he will attend a banquet hosted by Prime Minister Stojadinović. The next day, Delbos and his entourage will visit the tomb of Alexander I at Avala Mountain and the graves of soldiers killed in the European War, where they will lay wreaths. At noon, Prime Minister Stojadinović will host a banquet in the mountains, and he will be received by Second Regent Perović and Third Regent Stanković. He will only hold talks with Prime Minister Stojadinović, and will deliver a radio broadcast from the capital of Yugoslavia. In the evening, French Minister to Yugoslavia Domville will host a banquet. On the 14th, he will hold further talks with Stojadinović and issue a communiqué before departing for home in the evening. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia's Amity Towards Italy</h3>
<p>Talks Result in Satisfaction</p>
<p>[Rome] After Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović's official return visit to Rome, relations between Italy and Yugoslavia have been greatly strengthened. Stojadinović's trip has been closely watched by European governments. It ended last night. It is now believed that Yugoslavia will use its trade surplus with Italy to purchase Italian arms and aircraft. Before leaving Italy, Stojadinović visited Italian aircraft and arms factories in Milan, accompanied by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano and Italian Propaganda Minister Alfieri. Stojadinović stayed in Rome for a total of three days. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After the conclusion of the talks between Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the Italian government issued an official communiqué stating, "The Italian and Yugoslav authorities have reviewed the relations between the two countries and believe that their development is in harmony with the Italian-Yugoslav Treaty of Friendship. The political actions of the two countries are also in line with the treaty's provision of 'mutual cooperation in a spirit of friendship and good faith.' It is satisfactory to see that the treaty has produced good results. In addition, the authorities of both countries have expressed that they will make further efforts to make the cooperation between the two countries even closer in order to safeguard their common interests and guarantee peace." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Anti-Aircraft Units to be Deployed to Egypt</h3>
<p>Impact of Italy's Troop Increase in North Africa</p>
<p>[London] British military sources have stated that the first group of British anti-aircraft units is scheduled to be deployed to Egypt in early January next year. This is due to the concentration of Italian troops in Libya, North Africa. Currently, there are as many as two army corps stationed in Libya. The British authorities are therefore actively taking appropriate measures to restore the balance of power between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean. In addition, Britain is establishing a strong naval and air force base in Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean, making it a new Singapore in the Mediterranean, in order to protect the Suez Canal and the Haifa oil pipeline in Palestine. At the same time, it will also strengthen the position of Malta. On the other hand, Britain has sent a military mission, including British technicians and representatives from Vickers arms factory, to Portugal to assist the Portuguese government in establishing naval and air force bases in the Madeira Islands and the Azores. Foreign Secretary Eden met with Vickers factory officials yesterday, and the discussions were likely related to this matter. All of these developments are considered very important by British diplomatic circles, who believe that this is the precise work of Britain conducting negotiations with Italy on the Mediterranean situation, and the British government's determination to protect the lines of communication related to the survival of the Empire can also be seen in this. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Negotiations Showing Progress</p>
<p>[Washington] Commerce Secretary Roper stated today that the possibility of concluding a trade agreement between Britain and the United States in the near future seems promising. There has been progress in the current negotiations. The United States' international trade surplus for this year is approximately 100 million yuan, compared to only 33 million yuan last year. The total trade volume is 6.4 billion yuan, an increase of 31 percent compared to last year and 118 percent compared to 1932. (Kokumin, 8th)</p>
<h3>American Citizen Missing in Russia</h3>
<p>[Moscow] It was learned today that American citizens, New York writer Robinson and his wife, have suddenly disappeared from the national guesthouse. The US Embassy in Russia has begun an investigation. It is reported that Robinson has been missing for several days, while his wife was only discovered to be missing yesterday. (Kokumin, 9th)</p>
<h3>Severe Cold in the United States</h3>
<p>[Washington] Since Monday of this week, the entire country has been plagued by severe cold. At least fifty people have died. Meteorologists predict that the temperature will continue to drop and will not recover for two or three days. (Kokumin, 9th)</p>

<h3>Two Foreign Ships Carrying Rice to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Distribution Methods Already Agreed Upon; Difficulties Arise in Procuring Domestic Rice</p>
<p>The second batch of 26,000 bags of foreign rice from the Yongda Grain Company and the fifth batch of 25,000 bags of foreign rice from the French company Daufou are loaded on the Chengdu and Margarethe Söhle ships, respectively, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai simultaneously tomorrow. Distribution methods have already been agreed upon. Difficulties have arisen in procuring domestic rice, and rice from Nanshi has not yet been released. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Rice Ships Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Yongda Grain Company has ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice. The first batch of 20,000 bags has already arrived in Shanghai. The second batch of 26,000 bags, loaded on the Margarethe Söhle, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and dock at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The third batch of 29,000 bags is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th, and the fourth batch of 25,000 bags is scheduled to arrive on the 20th. The French company Daufou has reordered 50,000 bags of foreign rice, which will be shipped in two batches. The first ship (i.e., the fifth batch) is loaded on the Chengdu, which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 11:00 AM tomorrow and dock at the floating dock on the Bund of the French Concession. The second ship (i.e., the sixth batch) is scheduled to arrive on the 16th. Each batch contains 25,000 bags.</p>
<p>Distribution Methods Already Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries were made to rice industry groups, and it was learned that the distribution method for the two batches of foreign rice from Yongda Grain Company is as follows: The French Municipal Council will receive 8,000 bags, which will be distributed by the Rice Dealers Association to 200 rice shops in the French Concession, with each shop receiving 40 bags. 6,000 bags will be allocated for refugee relief, and the remainder will be sold directly by Yongda Grain Company to rice shops at a fair price. ㊁ The distribution method for the fifth batch of foreign rice from the French company Daufou is as follows: The Rice Dealers Association will receive 20,000 bags, which will be distributed to 500 member rice shops for retail, with each shop receiving 40 bags. The remaining 5,000 bags will be directly distributed by the company to various refugee relief organizations.</p>
<p>Association Stipulates Retail Methods</p>
<p>The Rice Dealers Association has stipulated the following methods for retail distribution of the fifth batch of foreign rice from the French company Daufou and the second batch of foreign rice from Yongda Grain Company: ㊀ The price is 8.5 fen per jin in national currency. ㊁ Each household is limited to a maximum of 1 yuan in national currency. As for the price at which the association receives the rice, ㊀ the price for delivery at the wharf is 16.15 yuan per bag in national currency. ㊁ The price for delivery at the warehouse is 16.45 yuan per bag in national currency. A temporary handling fee of 2.5 jiao per bag is charged in both cases. Furthermore, if the authorities of the Public Settlement and the French Concession discover that rice shops selling retail rice are selling whole bags but the weight is insufficient, in addition to being deprived of the right to sell foreign rice, they will be severely investigated.</p>
<p>Difficulties Arise in Procuring Domestic Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries were made to grain companies, and it was learned that member rice shops of the association were procuring domestic rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other places in eastern Zhejiang. After being approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and certified by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, they had dispatched personnel to procure it. However, in order to prevent food from falling into enemy hands and to maintain food supplies in their own counties, the various counties do not allow Shanghai grain merchants to procure large quantities of grain. Therefore, the shipment of domestic rice to Shanghai is, in fact, quite difficult.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Nanshi Rice Boats Ineffective</p>
<p>After negotiations by various rice industry groups to release the approximately 20,000 dan of domestic rice on rice boats in Nanshi proved ineffective, someone promised to negotiate with the Japanese side the day before yesterday. However, as of last night, it had still not been released. According to sources in the rice industry, the rice boats have been towed away by the Japanese to be used for corvée, and the rice on board has been unloaded and piled up in warehouses in Pudong. There is little hope of release.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Searched Yan Chuntang's Residence Last Night</h3>
<p>Yan's Residence at the Intersection of Difeng Road; Yan and His Wife Were Taken Away</p>
<p>Yan Chuntang, a merchant in this city, lives in a self-built house at Yan's residence at the intersection of Difeng Road on Route Ghisi Feirui in western Shanghai. At 6:30 PM yesterday, more than 20 Japanese soldiers arrived at Yan's residence in two military trucks and searched the premises. Yan Chuntang, his wife, a maid, and three servants were all taken away in military vehicles to the Japanese military headquarters. It is rumored that the Japanese soldiers found some firearms and ammunition in Yan's residence, and that Yan himself was related to a certain organization, and was therefore detained. However, around 8:00 PM that day, two people had already been released by the Japanese army. They were Yan's servants and were not involved in the case.</p>
<h3>Do Not Venture Near the Pudong Security Line</h3>
<p>On the walls of the Taikoo Company warehouse on Laiyi Ferry and the Longmao Warehouse on Lujiazui in Pudong, people often climb over the walls from inside the warehouses to go home and visit. They are unaware that the above two places are dangerous areas within the Japanese military security line. More than forty people have been shot and killed for climbing over the walls. At 1:45 PM yesterday, two more unnamed men climbed over the wall at the Longmao Warehouse and were shot and killed by the Japanese army. Therefore, it is hoped that no one will risk this danger in the future.</p>
<h3>Refugee Area Shelters More Than 150,000 Refugees</h3>
<p>Construction of Anti-Theft Wooden Fences Begins; Education Classes for Refugee Children Have Started</p>
<p>As of now, the Nanshi refugee area has sheltered a total of more than 157,000 refugees (including men, women, and children). Daily expenses amount to more than 15,000 yuan. Currently, the death rate is increasing daily due to the cold weather. According to Father Rao, the person in charge, he is determined to maintain the area to the best of his ability for at least six months. However, he still hopes that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate. In addition, a mimeographed notice signed "Propaganda Team of the Japanese Military Special Service Department" was recently posted in the refugee area. It instructed all refugees to gather at the Xicheng Kindergarten on Penglai Road in Nanshi on the 6th and 7th of this month to await instructions and receive permits. After that, they could return home with the permits, and Japanese soldiers would provide protection. Those who resisted and did not go, or those without permits, would not be allowed to pass. However, as of yesterday, no one had gone.</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee is determined to plan for the safety facilities in the Nanshi refugee area. It is reported that the committee plans to build wooden fences in the area to prevent theft, and construction has now begun. Except for the Fangbang Road area, which is adjacent to the security area and already has barbed wire, the areas where it plans to install fences include the important street intersections of Danfeng Road, Anren Street, Jiuxiaochang Road, Houjiabang Road, Yanhai Road, Haicang Street, Luxiangyuan Road, and Qinglian Street. The area will be safer after being opened and closed on time.</p>
<p>The Danhua Primary School shelter in the Nanshi refugee area houses more than 700 refugees. All supplies and internal management are maintained by Jiang Maopeng and Yang Yanjun, who were appointed by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Red Cross. Now, education classes for refugee children have also been organized. Classrooms have been set up in Danhua, and the first batch of more than 100 refugee children have begun attending classes. Textbooks from Commercial Press and other publishers are being used.</p>
<h3>Murder in the Refugee Area</h3>
<p>Yuan Caixing Chops Mother-in-Law to Death; French Police Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Yuan Caixing, a native of Ningbo, is 23 years old and used to run a foreign goods business. On the 26th day of the eleventh lunar month of the previous year, through a matchmaker, he married Miss Zheng (16 years old), the eldest daughter of Mrs. Zheng Zhou (44 years old, husband deceased), a fellow Ningbo native who lived at No. 5 on the north side of the western end of Jiumu Di Kou on Minguo Road (now part of the refugee area, opposite the Siming Guild Hall). After the marriage, he rented a place next door to his mother-in-law's house at No. 3. Because Yuan went out to do business, his wife lived alone at home, so that the mother and daughter could take care of each other. During this war, Yuan lost his job and was unemployed. His wife Zheng gave birth last month on the seventh day after being pregnant for the full term. Because they could not afford to hire someone to take care of the postpartum woman, his mother-in-law Zheng Zhou took care of her daughter nearby. At 9:00 AM on the 23rd of the same month, Zheng Zhou's seven-year-old youngest daughter, Zheng Jinxiang, and Yuan Caixing's niece, Chen Dongmei (the same age as Jinxiang, born to Yuan's sister), had a quarrel over trivial matters, which caused Zheng Zhou and her son-in-law Yuan Caixing to have a verbal argument. After being stopped by others, Yuan was resentful of his mother-in-law's improper behavior in enticing his wife. Still full of hatred, Yuan suddenly took a firewood axe that evening and rushed to No. 5 next door, chopping Zheng Zhou on the head three times (two axes on the back of the head and one axe on the right temple). She was injured and fell unconscious, with blood gushing out like a spring. After causing the disaster, Yuan escaped with the children. Later, the refugee area rescue team sent Zhou to Guangci Hospital. She died at 3:00 AM on the eighth day due to serious injuries and ineffective treatment. The hospital reported the case to the French Police because the refugee area was jointly managed by the French Concession police.</p>
<p>The refugee area director, Frenchman Langbo Le (formerly the head of the Mailan Police Station), dispatched detectives. The corpse's family had already prepared a coffin and went to the hospital to collect the body and move it to the Bing House of the Siming Guild Hall. Subsequently, the French police sent detectives to hoist the corpse and coffin to the corpse examination center of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. It was planned to report to the Special No. 2 Court to send someone to open the coffin for examination. At noon yesterday, Prosecutor Wang, a member of the Special No. 2 Court, came to the center with a forensic doctor to examine the corpse. Because the deceased lived in the refugee area and was injured and victimized, and had received treatment at the hospital, Yuan Zheng, the daughter of the corpse, was questioned about the deceased's experience at the time of the injury, and the investigator reported the investigation situation. After it was proven that the case did not require opening the coffin, it was confirmed that Zheng Zhou had indeed died from chop wounds. The corpse and coffin were taken back by the corpse's daughter, and the investigation of the murderer was pending.</p>
<h3>Tranquil Market Conditions in Nanhui</h3>
<p>Local Defense Corps Maintain Local Order</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, Nanhui has never been devastated. After our army withdrew, the city was maintained by the previous local defense corps, and the various towns were maintained by the local militia. The villagers there did not even know there was a war. However, the party department personnel have all temporarily evacuated or disbanded. Rumors that Tao Xuesheng's guerrillas clashed with the Japanese army are not true. The Japanese army only reached Zhoupu. People still come and go in Nanhui every day, and market conditions remain tranquil.</p>
<h3>Red Cross International Committee Establishes War Zone Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Investigate Conditions in the Suburbs and Find Ways to Send People Back to Farm; Send Telegram to US Ambassador Wang Requesting Assistance from Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the relief work of the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross has been extremely urgent. As the war has spread and the war zone has expanded, the number of refugees and wounded soldiers has increased daily. Relief and shelter should be expanded accordingly. Therefore, the War Zone Relief Committee was established the day before yesterday, and Dr. Zhu Youyu was appointed as the chairman to be responsible for planning and striving for progress. It is currently preparing for relief efforts in Wuxing. It plans to allocate 1,000 yuan first and hand it over to the Huzhou Church Hospital for medical treatment. There are currently more than 8,000 refugees in the Suzhou Guangfu Town shelter, who are in urgent need of relief. 10,000 yuan in national currency has been allocated to the Wuxian International Committee for relief. Furthermore, considering that most of those sheltered in the concessions and the Nanshi refugee area are residents of the suburbs, long-term support is difficult and not what the refugees want. The committee has organized inspection teams composed of foreigners to go to Jiangwan, Pudong, Wusong, Liuhe, Nanxiang, Kunshan, Dachang, Taicang, Songjiang, Jiading, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places to investigate local conditions so that they can send people back at the appropriate time. The committee, in view of the fact that the various shelters in the city are requesting subsidies, feels that raising donations cannot be delayed at all. It has also sent a telegram to Ambassador Wang Zhengting in New York, requesting him to inform various overseas Chinese groups to allocate funds for assistance.</p>
<h3>Women's Handicraft Relief Sale</h3>
<p>Participants Already Number Over Twenty Organizations</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Women's Community initiated the Shanghai Women's Handicraft Relief Sale, preparations have been going smoothly, and women's organizations have been participating enthusiastically. As of yesterday, participants included the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association, the Women's Movement League, the Women's Temperance Union, the Women's Production Cooperative, the Girl Scout Service Corps, etc. In terms of schools, in addition to the Chinese and Western Municipal Council Girls' High School, there are also more than twenty schools, including Guangxia, Zhizhong, Shanghai Girls' High School, China Women's Vocational School, Biwen, Qixiu, Yunzhong, Aiguo, Huaijiu, Weifeng, and Zhenxin. In order to achieve maximum efficiency, the association has elected a committee of twenty-one members, divided into five groups: General Affairs Group: Liu Wang Liming, Chen Naiwen, Li Guo Xingyan, Xue Zheng, Zhang Dezhao; Collection Group: Guan Cuizhen, Yang Nie Yu, Zhou Cuiying, Lin Dezhao; Receiving and Inspection Group: Han Huaying, Zheng Zhaomin, Cao Jingyuan, Luo Shuzhang; Sales Group: Wu Lao Wei Yu, Hu Yingzhou, Zhong Hui Yu, Qi Yiying; Publicity Group: Chuan Xiaofeng, Chen Luwei, Jin Guangmei, Zhou Aizhu. The dates are set for the 18th and 19th of this month, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Admission is one yuan per ticket.</p>
<h3>International Relief Society Continues to Collect One-Cent Donations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the International Relief Society in this city continued to collect one-cent donations from all walks of life, including 105 yuan from colleagues of the Family Industry Cooperative, 41 yuan from Hengfeng Heji Silk and Cloth Store, 87 yuan from colleagues of Dingkangzhuang, and 46 yuan donated on behalf of others for cotton clothes for refugees. The entire Chinese staff of Renji Hospital donated 22 yuan, Xin Yongshun colleagues 6 yuan, residents of Lane 16, Zhenpingli, 7.2 yuan, Hengtaixiang colleagues 51 yuan, the Silver and Money Industry Amateur Friendship Association colleagues 193.86 yuan, Hengkang Medicinal Materials Store 15 yuan, and Lower B Class of the Science and Technology Public School of the Municipal Council 3.3 yuan. Individual donations were also very enthusiastic. According to the person in charge of the society, one unit is accumulated when one-cent donations reach three yuan. Donating one unit can save one refugee, and more can be saved by analogy. In order to establish a relationship between donors and rescued refugees, the society plans to prepare a kind of cloth strip with the donor's name written on it for the rescued refugees to wear on their chests. Donors can also visit the refugees they have saved. However, the society does not restrict donors who do not wish to do so.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 9th), there were quite a lot of vegetables arriving at the vegetable markets in the city's concessions, and prices also fell. The prices yesterday morning are extracted as follows: Green vegetables 8 cents per catty, spinach 10 cents, soybean sprouts 5 cents, cabbage 6 cents, "Jiao" vegetables 6 cents, salted vegetables 12 cents, Shepherd's purse 10 cents. Fresh meat prices have also fallen due to smooth supply, and one yuan can buy three catties of fresh meat. Fresh chicken is one catty and twelve taels to two catties per yuan. However, fresh fish and other items are still in short supply.</p>
<h3>Land Without People in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>Searching Everywhere for People, But Finding No One</p>
<p>When our army withdrew from the townships and towns of West Shanghai, all the residents had to temporarily evacuate to safer places due to the situation at the time. Later, traffic was cut off, and they were unable to return, resulting in land without people, which caused much inconvenience. It is now heard that the garrisoned troops there urgently need local people to come forward and maintain order in order to restore the situation. A certain Mr. Zhang, who lives in the Caojing district, was instructed a few days ago to come to Shanghai for negotiations. However, the people of the western townships are scattered and living in different places, and it is not easy to find them in a hurry. Therefore, he has been running around all day without any progress. On the one hand, he is deeply afraid of delaying the deadline and hindering progress. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he obtained a few local villagers to return to their hometown to report on the situation.</p>
<h3>Public Welfare Yarn Factory Workers Enthusiastically Provide Relief</h3>
<p>The colleagues of the Public Welfare Yarn Factory on Robison Road in this city have always been enthusiastic in supporting good deeds. Recently, seeing the refugees in the city's shelters in dire straits, all the workers specially collected 174.92 yuan, plus 22 yuan donated by the staff in recent days, for a total of 196.92 yuan, which was sent to the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross the day before yesterday for relief purposes.</p>
<h3>Another Fire in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The big fire in Nanshi had already been extinguished, but in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, another big fire broke out in the area of Damu Bridge and Xiaomu Bridge, burning down large buildings of public and private organizations. The fire was very fierce and was only extinguished this morning.</p>
<h3>The "Great Road Municipal Government" Police Bureau Established Today</h3>
<p>Water Patrol Team Organized and Ready - Local Court Said to be Restored Soon</p>
<p>After the so-called Great Road Municipal Government was established in Pudong on the 5th of this month, the government office was set up in Wang Yinquan's new residence behind the Zhang family garden on Dongchang Road. Now, the garden in front has been cleared to create a road 5 zhang wide for cars to enter and exit. Parking lots are being built day and night on both sides of the road. Zhu Yuzhen, a northerner, is the Chief of the Police Bureau and has been preparing in Tang Adong's residence behind the Pudong Hospital. It is scheduled to be officially established today (the 10th). The rumor that it has already been established is inaccurate. It is heard that the appointed section chiefs are Xie Kai and several other northerners. Xie is nearly old and served under Sa Zhenbing, the General Superintendent of the Songhu Water and Land Police in the third year of the Republic of China. After the bureau is established, it will proceed with the establishment of various sub-bureaus, such as Nanshi, Ximen, Xinzha, Caojiadu, and North Station, and the Water Patrol Headquarters. The chiefs of the sub-bureaus have not yet been officially announced. The rumor that someone has been internally appointed is inaccurate. As for the recruited police, in addition to the more than one hundred in the Pudong Sub-Bureau, the long-term police of the other sub-bureaus, who are currently training at the Propaganda and Comfort Class Training Institute, total only three teams, only 360 people. The first and third teams are stationed in Xin Pudongli on Shantang Road, and the second team is stationed in the Zhang family residence in Pengjiazhai. It is heard that the Police Chief is now inviting former section members of the Municipal Police Bureau to return to their positions, but Wang and other important former section members have not accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>The Pudong Great Road Municipal Government will first establish the Police Bureau, with Wei Jiezhen as the Captain of the Police Brigade (formerly a patrol officer at Zhoujiaqiao of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau), Ma Ziyun as the Captain of the Water Patrol Team (formerly a detective of the Water Patrol Team), and Detective Captain Zhang Yong (formerly a squad leader of the Detective Team). It is heard that they have already taken office. As for the Water Patrol Team, it is the most advantageous position in the city's police organization, and its jurisdiction covers the entire Huangpu River and the entire Suzhou Creek. It is divided into two squads. The headquarters of the Water Patrol Team originally only had a large-scale floating pier with many buildings, which were wider than the police stations on land. It was originally stationed at Dongjiadu Wharf, but after the war, it moved to Wangjiadu in Sanlintang. It is now planned to tow it to its original location in Nanshi. They have now taken over and announced the positions of the squad leaders, patrol officers, and police chiefs. Qian Yinshan, Zhang Gengfa, Xu Gen, Jiang Gensheng, and others all hold important positions. As for the allocation within the Detective Team, it remains the same as before. Each sub-bureau has one squad leader. Those who served as detectives in the past have mostly gone to Pudong to request reinstatement, and it is generally expected that they will be properly assigned. The squad leader at the Caojiadu Police Station will be Wu, Chen Si will be sent to Zhabei, and Zhou Jiaxiang is planned to be sent to Ximen. Gao will be sent to the Nanshi Bund. At the same time, the court, which maintains security, is now in talks to restore operations. It is estimated that a certain lawyer hopes to be the president of the court, and a certain lawyer who does good deeds in the refugee area also has a new appointment as a prosecutor.</p>

<h3>French Concession Businesses Send Letter Requesting Attention to Theft</h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Businesses Jointly Send Letter to the French Consul General - Increase Patrols During Curfew Hours</p>
<p>More than thirty businesses in the French Concession, including shops on Rue Lafayette, Rue Chaleux, Route des Soeurs, and Cais Market, such as Caizhitang, Jinzhangxiang, Renhe Rice Store, Yongtaixiang, Dasheng Candy Company, Zhenchang Rice Store, jointly sent a letter to the Director of the Police Department of the French Concession yesterday, requesting attention to theft in order to maintain public order. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, we observe that the time has come for winter defense, and thieves are rampant. Robbery cases are frequently heard of, especially by ordinary petty thieves who take advantage of this opportunity to steal on a large scale, which is repeatedly seen. Even several alerts occur in one day. For example, Jinchangxiang Soy Sauce Garden at 170 Rue Chaleux was robbed on October 7. On the night of November 17 and the night of November 29, thieves pried open the store door to steal. Renhe Rice Store at 215 Rue Lafayette was robbed of 4,000 yuan on October 12. On the night of December 5, Caizhitang at 132 Rue Lafayette had its facade pried open by thieves, and a copper sign on the wall was stolen. Fortunately, the main door was strong and was not pried open. Similar cases have occurred in other businesses. It has been investigated that many of the above-mentioned incidents occurred during the nighttime curfew hours. Because there are no pedestrians on the road, these people can calmly use their groping and stealing techniques when they think the police are not paying attention, prying open the doors of various stores to steal, and even the signs are not spared.

<h3>Current Situation in Longhua</h3>
<p>Since the start of the August 13th battle in this city, Longhua Town was first bombed by the air force, causing the destruction of the Longhua Ancient Temple, a historical site. Later, as the front line moved back, it suffered even more from stray bullets, with walls pierced and buildings collapsing, leaving a scene of devastation.

Now, a person from the town says that there are no garrisoned troops in Longhua Town at the moment, but the doors of all the houses have been opened, and the machines and other items of the factories have long been moved away. Longhua Elementary School and the former Garrison Headquarters buildings have been burned down, and fires occur in the nearby civilian houses from time to time. A temporary wounded soldier hospital is set up inside the Longhua Cement Factory. Wounded soldiers from the front line are first transported to the hospital for bandaging and then transported to Shanghai by small steamboats. Therefore, the steamboats at the factory's wharf are quite busy.</p>

<h3>Sugar, Seafood, North-South Dry Goods Industry Raises Funds to Relieve Fellow Citizens</h3>
<p>Totaling 11,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since Father Raad has meticulously planned and designated a refugee area, the distressed fellow citizens have been able to eke out a living. However, the supplies are vast and long-term concerns are considerable. Fortunately, people from China and abroad have sympathized with the relief efforts and have risen to supply them. After a month, they have been able to maintain a miserable state. The Sugar, Seafood, and North-South Dry Goods Trade Association Committee Members of the Joint Market, in view of the hunger and cold of the fellow citizens, adhering to the spirit of empathizing with one's own hunger and drowning, jointly initiated fundraising for nine industries. Since the start of the process, although members of each industry have been in the midst of a trading halt, they have all been able to do their part, and enthusiastically contribute their savings from frugal living. The results are excellent. It has now raised a total of 11,000 yuan. In addition to directly providing cotton clothes, tea, water, and salt to fellow citizens in need, most of the collected donations will be entrusted to Father Raad for the entire planning, distribution, and relief efforts.

<h3>Xingsheng Street Relief Society Seeks Substitutes to Make Bread</h3>
<p>Can Subsidize Fuel and Other Expenses Appropriately</p>
<p>The Woolen Industry Trade Association and the mutual aid society of the same industry in this city, and the Xingsheng Street Relief Society jointly organized by various merchants on Xingsheng Street, since the establishment of the Nanshi Refugee Area, the society has been supplying food to more than 3,000 refugees every day, sending personnel to the refugee area for distribution. Later, in order to implement the relief purpose, the society handled the formalities for district-based field investigation and registration, changed to issuing food coupons, and sent personnel every day to distribute food to designated numbers with coupons in Dakangli, Jisansi Street, and exchanged them for food coupons for the next day. Therefore, once refugees are registered with the society, they can continuously receive food every day. The method is very complete and the order is also good. The work has been going on for nearly a month. It is also heard that Shenxin and Dongfang No. 2 factories, as well as benefactors from all walks of life, have donated food and asked the society to distribute it on their behalf. According to the person in charge of the society, the daily bread distribution to refugees requires more than 15,000 pieces (approximately more than 20 bags of flour). However, due to the increasing demand in recent times, it is feared that the original substitute manufacturing places will not be able to supply enough. Now, it seeks enthusiastic people to make it as a substitute. It is heard that the society can subsidize fuel and other expenses appropriately. It is hoped that those who can make bread can go to the society's office at No. 46 Xingsheng Street for negotiation.</p>
