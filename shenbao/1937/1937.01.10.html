<h3>新年談日本</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>在日本的月份牌上，用四號字印出的是新暦，七號字印出的是舊曆；此外還印着日本的年號及種種紀念日。不用說，舊曆來自中國，新曆來自西洋，新暦比舊曆適合，新曆便安排在主要位置上，舊曆不過是附屬的吧了。這種安排，恰好說明着現代日本對於外來文化的接受態度。外來文化與日本土產文化（種種紀念日可以代表）的合流，便是今日的日本。</p>
<p>任何文化，只有適用的，才會被保存，被發展。被保存被發展的文化，又大半以適合於當時“權力者”的口味，能滿足當時“權力者”的利益者為限。不適合“權力者”的口味，反抗“權力者”的東西，那是必遭嚴禁，排斥的。到今日，舊歷還被安排在日本月份牌的從屬地位上，這當然是因為舊暦也還有一點用處吧。</p>
<p>自然科學比社會科學幸運多了。無論民主國，皇國，社會主義國……自然科學差不多都有兌現的價值。說到社會科學方面呢？自日德協定成立，一種特殊的國際反共產主義，已經取得更進一步的聯絡了。但也只是一種聯絡，日本自有日本的“大日本主義”，絕不致把希特勒主義完全搬來。正如：當日本寺內陸相和政黨舌戰的時候，政黨以憲政做武器，寺內便說：“日本的憲政應與歐美的不同。”政黨也不能否認這不同。日本社會大衆黨的書記長麻生久，在日德協定公佈的那一天，聲明該黨原是“反共產主義”的，但在同一聲明裏，又說該黨是主張社會主義的。在社會主義的運動史上，社會主義的派別原不少，不知麻生久信仰的是那一派？在討論“人民戰綫”及“國民戰綫”的一次座談會上，麻生久不贊成人民戰綫運動的最大理由是：“日本有日本的特殊國情。”—由此可知日本社大黨的社會主義，旣不是今日蘇聯的社會主義，也不是歐美　任何派的社會主義，大槪寺內陸相認識憲政的那種精神，也就是麻生久認識社會主義的那一精神，本來憲政和社會主義等，都是外來文化，但在“皇道維新”的國度中，能適用的程度確很少，這就比安排新舊日曆複雜多也困難多了。</p>
<p>要使複雜變為簡單，制霸今日的軍部說：“以日本精神為基調……”（陸軍發行的小冊子：軍部充實及庶政一新—八十七頁）。要使困難變為容易，久說︰“棄個人主義而取全體主義，以個人為犧性而從大義的國家意思……”（國防之本義及其強化之提倡）。這就差不多像處理月份牌上的日曆了。</p>
<p>張三是個小白臉，李逵是個蠻闖漢。有的中國人愛食西餐，一般東洋人愛吃“支那料理”（中國菜）。各國有各國的特殊性，這原是一個眞理。近代戰爭，又有那國不用飛機大砲呢，這又是一個普遍的眞理。但日本輸入的軍需品多是原料（金屬類及原油，重油等）原料製成武器後，那就不是外貨，而是貫穿着“日本精神”的武器了。總之，“日本精神”，在國際意義上是表示日本之特殊性的，在國內，却表示日本的舉國一致性。假使還有不一致的地方，就使統制強化，強化……。</p>
<p>此種“統制強化”的事實，如：“行政機構改革”，“議會改革”，“貿易統制”，“電力國營”等，不必再說了。這裹且舉幾種通常事：新年前幾天，東京交通工人總同盟，為改善生活，曾提出二十八個條件來要求（一般報紙只登載着這一理件的大略），這就是所謂的“年關鬥爭”了。但，調解的消息雖已見報，結果得到了甚麽呢？這劫未見下文。回憶一九三五年底，“東交工人”亦曾有同性質的要求。那要求的態度，從報紙上的記載來比較，比此次更强哩。但也曾在“強制調解”下解决了。像一九三四年那樣的東京電車大罷工，近年來就不曾有過。這就是以證明“日本精神”的大進步。此外，如軍部禁止其軍需工業部門的工人加人工會，雖為社大黨及勢農無產協會反對，但一令禁止也就終於禁止下去了。因為這是“非常詩”，當以“個人為犧牲而從大義的國家意思”。至於金融王三菱家的銅礦山（尾去澤）潰濫事件，罹災者一千六百名。此等罹災工人，只能說他們是命運註定的。說三菱只圖减輕成本，設備不周的，那也只是說說吧了。</p>
<p>在“日本精神”上，今日是國防第一主義。軍部關於國防強化的主張，是：“……反對階級鬥爭，開發資源，振興產業，促進貿易，以至於經濟統制”。（據黑田隆三言）</p>
<p>在統制強化，及國防強化下，日本社會內部的矛盾，彷彿消失大半了。飛躍着的是“日本精神！”</p>
<p>在“日本精神”飛躍着的新年中，當然是普天同慶的。</p>
<p>雖然國民負担已較往年增加了六億（大增稅）但孩子們也一樣的要父母給他們買風箏，吃點心，穿新衣……。雖然一九三六年的日本貿易，比一九三五年减色不少，（入超一億三千萬元）而一九三七年的貿易預想，入超更將增加到一值八千萬元，（讀賣新聞—一月一日），但軍事預算已增至十四億元以上了，而且從一月一日起，全世界海軍的發展競爭，又已走進無條約時代，所以，至少，軍需工業的景氣，是可以點綴一下日本社會的繁榮的。</p>
<p>這是一個櫻花國，雖然現在櫻花還未發蕾，但櫻花似的婦女衣色，櫻花似的商店裝飾……，一見總是美的，含着笑意的。</p>
<p>希特勒總統治下的象，也為着親睦邦交，在此時，和其他的奇異野獸，一塊兒到東京來了。象是象徵和平的吧，象到東方來，東方的一九三七年是怎樣和平呢？</p>
<p>日本的右翼政黨，已經關始在從事建造了，回教文化協進會（一九三六年十一月在東京成立）的工作，也在與日推進。所謂“滿洲國”留日學生的人數，經三省（陸軍，外務，文部）協議的結果，也决定由量的發展轉向到質的改進了，本年規定約五百名。</p>
<p>新年一定有幾個風箏會斷綫吧？如果風力太強了。</p>
<p>便是看着日本孩子放風箏，也不會忘記身在異國，因日本的風箏上，畫的也多是“武士道”。</p>
<p>新年談日本，更加一番鄕愁了。（一九三七，一，一日。）</p>

<h3>中華民族的團結</h3>
<p>— 顧頡剛</p>
<p>血統相同者的集團，呌做種族。有共同的歷史背景，生活方式，而又有團結一致的民族情緒的集團，呌做民族。在我們的國家裏，大家久已熟知可以分為五族，所以辛亥革命之後卽高揭“五族共和”的族幟。我們暫不妨循着一般人的觀念，說中國有五個種族；但我們確實認定，在中國的版圖裏只有一個中華民族。在這個民族裏的種族，他們的利害榮辱是一致的，離之則兼傷，合之則並茂。我們要使中國成為一個獨立自由的國家，非先從團結國內各種族入手不可。</p>
<p>現在所認為五個種族的人民及其居往的區域，我們應當知道是清代形成的。在清代以前，為了戰爭，征服，移徙和同化，血統已不知混合了多少次，區域也不知遷動了多少次。所以漢族裹早已加入了其他各族的血液，而其他各族之中也都有漢族的血液，純粹的種族是找不到了。尤其是漢族，相傳孔子作春秋時，“諸侯用夷禮則夷之，夷狄而進於中國則中國之，”他只認文化之同而不認血統之異，後人也都接受了這個見解，所以只要願意加入的就可收容，其血統尤為複雜。因此，我們可以進一步說：我們只有民族文化的自覺而沒有種族血統的偏見，我們早有很高超的民族主義。</p>
<p>不幸滿清一代為了便於隔別統治起見，嚴密施行離間各族的政策。彼此旣不能通婚，也不能游歷，弄得情意隔閡得很；更定下許多不平等的法律，表示許多不平等的待遇，逼得各族之間起了強烈的猜疑和仇恨。本來是一家人，被清室的政治手腕分開了，於是環着中原的有四個種族的居地清楚分出疆界來，種族之見也漸漸濃厚起來。民國成立，該有融和的機會了，然而因為一般人受了二百多年的蔽塞，對於這問題太過漠視，造不起與論，而政府又忙於對付內亂外患，也不能在這一方面特別注意。直到今天，彼此的隔閡和猜疑還未能祛除。然而強敵的蠶食鯨吞已不容我們再漠視了。我們要提倡民族主義，便不能不使國內各種族達到通力合作的境界。</p>
<p>我說這句話，住在內地的人或者感不到這個需要的迫切。實在，國人對於這方面的常識太缺乏了。曾有一個蒙古青年向我訴不平，他說：“我們到內地求學，同學們常常問我，‘你們蒙古的風俗和我們中國有什么不同？’他們不想想，蒙古就始中國的一部分！”我聽了這句話，只有慚愧。學生尚且如此，還說別的！這種以漢人為中國本位而排屏他族於中國國外的態度，自然最易激起他族的不安心理。帝國產義的國家知道我們各族間的情意太隔膜了，就用欺騙手段來作分化運動。於是假借了各種機會，用強力奪取我們的國土而成立某某國；又用金錢收買我國的奸徒，盡情搗亂，醞釀組織某某國。漢人馬虎，他族上當，而敵人乃大收不勞而獲之利。如果我們再不做防微杜漸的工作，預遏將來的隱憂，眼看我們國內活潑潑的各族將依次做了呆木木的傀儡而同歸於盡了！</p>
<p>在國內諸族中，漢族自然文化最高，取得先進的地位而負了指導的責任的。然而大哥哥的智識比弟弟們豐富，這是當然的事，並沒有可驕傲的理由。而且漢人如果自省一下，何嘗沒有內慚之點。試問蒙回藏人為宗敎而犧性一切的熱烈信仰，漢人能有嗎？蒙回人健於騎射能在馬上吃飯睡覺的尚武精神，漢人能有嗎？回人屏絕烟酒等嗜好的刻苦風範，漢人能有嗎？這種習性，都是復興我們民族的原動力，是珍貴不過的。漢人的文化固是燦然可觀，但揭開底層只有黃老學派的“向後退”的思想，以致只求享受，不肯犧牲，只顧身家，不知社會，民族精神岌落已極。我們吸取他族的長處還來不及，哪能用了傲眼來看人呢！</p>
<p>我們漢人如果能用了平等的眼光和同情心來看國內各族，如果能認識時代的需要來喚起他們的民族情緒，那麽，我們便應當澈底廢除“附庸”的謬見，盡力增進彼此的了解，使得國內各族確能團結而成為一個堅固的民族。換句話說，我們不要僅在名義上團結，更不可在私利及壓力下強迫團結，而要在同情和合作中作眞誠的團結：我們要生活在相互和平之中，以求共同的存在，同樣在天壤間取得獨立自由的地位。</p>
<p>怎樣可以團結起來呢？我想，應有下列三方面的初步工作。</p>
<p>第一，物質方面，是經濟的建設。邊疆人民的貧困是不可掩蔽的事實，然而邊疆上却盡多未開發的富源。不要說礦產還藏在山裏，就是那邊人民倚以為生的畜牧，也因沒有醫藥設備，常常整羣瘟死：屠宰之後骨角毛羽又棄置滿地，使物不能盡其用。我們應當鼓勵農業和工業的專家多到邊地去，指導當地人民增進生產技術，使得他們能用自力來開發。又交通的不方便是阻礙開發的大原因，我們現在要到新疆西藏去，其困難遠過於到歐美去，這樣如何可以謀生產的合作，所以鐵道，公路，航路，飛行，郵電等交通網，都應當次第設置，使全國各處的消息靈通，運輸便利，實收地域分工的厚利。</p>
<p>第二，精神方面，是文化的建設。各族間俱有特殊的文化，須求充分的彼此了解。首先應該注意的是語言文字的介紹工作。漢蒙回藏四種語文，都是中華民國今日行用的國文國語，不可偏廢。蒙回藏地方的學校應以本地語文為主，而以漢文為輔；內地學校應以漢文為主，而以蒙回藏文為輔。我們不但要保存當地的語言文字，更要發展當地的文學和藝術，充實他們的智慧遺產要這樣做，方可使國內各種不同文化的分子互相了解別的文化集團裏的各種文化。</p>
<p>第三，行政方面，是邊地人才的授擢和舊有漢人腐敗勢力的掃除。邊區子弟何嘗無才，只是離中央較遠，不能為政府所知而已。如能因邊疆富源的開發而多設立學校（不違背他們風俗，宗教及社會組織的學校），則將如初襲的土地，因地力的豐厚而獲得鉅大的生產，必有特殊人才之興起可以斷言。至於舊有漢人的腐敗勢力，不顧國家大局，利用當地人民受國家法律保護的不周，欺侮良善，盤剝重利，詐取貨物，無所不至，實為彼此合作的障礙，非掃除不可，否則當地人民將永遠錯解漢人是謀私利的，用了猜疑的眼光來看我們，我們的誠意合作就無從取得他們的信用了。</p>
<p>中華民族的團結是一件大事情，本文的旨趣只在喚起國人對於這方面的注意，詳細計畫决非單篇文字可盡說。希望大家心裹常存着這個問題，共同討論，來對付當前的迫切的局面。</p>

<p>廣州通信、九龍城主權隸屬、近今發生一外交大問題、頗為國人所注意、查九龍一地、與粵省寶安縣壤地相接、九龍自割讓於英後、英國香港政府、卽努力經營、蓋香港孤懸一島、祇瀕海之區為商店聚集、除數大馬路外、卽屬山嶺、僅可闢作住宅區、未能盡量發展工商業、而九龍興香港相隔對海、一葦可航、日接連粵省內地、附近鄕村旣有糧食與淡水（香港缺乏淡水、飲料俱由水塘瀕落雨水充日常之用、）之供給、故英政府割去九龍後、卽與我國政府共同經營廣九鐵路、目下廣九鐵路英段之終點、卽在九龍、近年以來、港中巨大工廠及堆棧、多設於九龍、蓋英人視九龍不啻為香港之生命綫、最近粵漢鐵路南北通車、而廣九•粵漢•兩路接軌、又擬實行、他日接軌完成、則九龍將成為粵漢鐵路南段之終站、亦卽我國南北大動脈之華南，終點、其地位且較香港尤屬重耍、眼光銳利遠大之英人、其重視九龍、殆具有深心也、</p>
<p>“九龍”與“九龍城”、雖同在一地、其中實有歷史上關係與主權上之分歧、當清代割讓九龍時、清吏為國家體面計、曾力爭割餘一小地段、建築城堡、駐有官吏、對國內表示仍有九龍國土之美名、當時英人以割有九龍、幾及全部、祇餘九龍城區區二十餘里、亦願歸還中國、考九龍城之建立、在清朝道光年間、迄今約八十餘年、城內有居民四百餘、戶口六七十、小學一所、教室廟宇各一、居民多業農牧中上之家、則作買於香港及南洋、我國統治九龍城、載於一八九八年六月間中英所訂之條約、歷安無異、英人近以九龍將成為華南陸運交通之終點、大有發展之可能、對於九龍城、而思併吞、以完成其理想中之企圖、遂不顧約章、藉口九龍城係在九龍割讓地內範圍內、九龍城之有中國旗飄揚、實與香港政府治安行政權有碍、聲言必須取銷該城之中國主權、旋於去年十月間、強派英警、將九龍城內民居拆卸、當時城內居民大起反對、紛電兩廣外交署請向英國抗議、當時港政府因我外交當局提出交涉與居民之反抗、拆卸工程、暫為停止、</p>
<p>詎至去年底（二十五年十二月二十九日）英屬九龍南約理民府、突又派出英警二名、暨工人數名、馳至九龍城內、強將第二十五號門牌房屋拆毀、戶主楊偉雄、赤手空拳、無力阻止、祇得率其一家老弱數口、含淚而別其祖居鄰房以禍迫眉睫、立卽籌組九龍城案後援會、一面就近電兩廣外交特派員公署訴苦、一面推派代表楊偉雄盧章二人、於十二月三十日到粵、分謁外交特派員刁作謙、及粵省政府主席黃慕松、請立向對方提出交涉、以維國土、而保主權、刁當答允先向英國駐粵領事、請咨九籠理民府、先停止拆卸民居、其理由係根據日前英駐華大使覆牒、聲明以後不再有強迫九龍城居民遷居事、今突有強拆之舉、顯違信約、一方再電駐華英使、力爭尊重我國管理九龍城主權、盧楊兩代表、旋分向粵僑務處及華僑團體請一致聲援、粵僑務處經派職員二名先往九龍城宣慰難民、華僑團體除三月致電聲援外、四日復召集會議、共商援救辦法、外交特派員公署亦將派員赴九龍城調查被拆民居眞相、并搜集材料、以為提出交涉之準備、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>米價前途　易漲難跌　糧商笑逐顏開不肯輕售　貧民升斗維艱將苦米貴</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日滬南浦江中各帮米船共到三十餘號、貨約六千一二百石、內中薄稻有廿餘號、浦中船米日來銷滯、積存漸厚、本街銷塲又部呈觀望之態、客帮則因天津市面、步步下落、亦都守候不前、祇青島帮辦薄稻七八百包、逎致售方所有之貨、售脫無幾、市况更形清寂、結果、若薄稻行情修小數分至一角、厚粳削角半、杜洋尖及陰元等各花色均未見做開、後市繼勞、照此浦中積米、逐日增加、包子去路一再呆化、似難樂觀之望、然一年以來、不但上海米市幾全以北方銷路為大宗、常錫一帶之米、不由上海而逕裝運北直南粵者數比上海所輪出者尤鉅、近一月來、滬上米商向浙西各地方買米、輓運不絕、以秈米尖米為多、故糙秈之價亦漲至八元許、粵方則仍慮食米不敷、尚在請免進口洋米稅以圖接濟、而平米價、糧食運銷局雖告成立、猶未見有何發展、蘇松各地薄糙經各方之搬運、已達九元左右、本年農產各物皆貴、鄕民儘有能力、待售價而沽諸、故如滬上米價疲軟、內地行客對於到滬之貨、或不難暫時存於內地以守候機會、來源旣稀、非至相當價格、未肯輕脫、是以觀察後市變化、正恐成易漲難跌之局面、加之上海糧商、一年來亦無一不漲、為本年一月實行所得稅之故、頗多於國暦年終作一結束、故無論何種糧食行號、無不笑逐顏開、皆獲巨利、尤以朱某之行公開之盈餘已有二三十萬元、其他可知、煺商旣皆得利、對於糧價之暗中維特亦必有力、因之民食方面、調節尚不知能否實現、米珠薪桂、則已迫在目前而交相咨嗟矣、至昨日閘北方面米市各地到貨三四十號、市上各貨去路平定、白粳價跌二三角、薄稻價小一角零、早稻價亦小角許、羊埠杜尖價均小近角、變元價短一角左右、其餘之米價亦小數分至近角、</p>
<p>（客秈）昨日客秈市况、到銷兩旺、到貨由漢口湘贛各地裝到日有萬包左右、而去路因粵胃不衰、市形極俏、本街汕頭河南北洋各帮均有應酬、粵帮採辦糙米更貪、辦去漢口糙五千包、湖南江西各糙三四千包、而後胃仍濃市價立卽跳漲角外、其他機米等因非粵胃、祇居站局而已、金日開出湘米一千六百包、漢糙五千包贛米四千九百廿四包、溫甬紹各米一千二百廿五包暹邏米彔二百包、</p>
<p>粉麥升降無常　昨又隨洋麥銳落</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份突呈暴落之態、因洋麥報價、回跌頗勁、芝加哥近跌五角零、遠跌七角零、坎拿大跌四五角不等、當開價後、以自下市塲之目標、多數憑國外為轉移、前日之反漲、基於洋麥、故昨日洋麥一跌、人心遂又大鬆、且總結束不遠、凡客路生意、多數停頓、所以外行盡力活動、追縱甚力市面之漲跌無常、當為此故、計半日中、各月份均向跌四五六分不等、迨至下午開盤、交易轉清、市車盤旋、一二月份較好一分、三四月份則無出入、後步情形、以洋麥升沉莫定、起伏當屬不少云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤、各月份市面、呈一致鬆跌之象、以洋麥報價亦回跌四五角至七角零、當開價後、因前日之漲風純為洋麥所激動、今則洋麥已跌、因此賣氣大盛、開價卽跌六七八分不等、惟實戶觀望、交易不暢迨至下午開盤、因粉市甚平、業外多頭、有一部分回脫、故遠期又跌三五分、此後如粉銷寂寞、麥市當少生色可言也、現麥市面、交易不暢、全市祇二千餘包交易、價較前日略小三四分云、金融</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標交易了結居多　差度祇有一角　結果毫無上落</p>
<p>金市昨初因海外銀市、英美俱縮、德蒙里遠期銀價縮三釐半、滙兌微升、倫敦生金勿動、中居銀行掛牌揭曉、美英俱平、海關金單位勿動、標準標金價掛牌亦仍為一一五一元三角、晨開平盤、開後大戶求供雖殷、但均為了結交易、毫無上落、滙豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅縮半分、半天間僅有一角差度、呆滯萬分、今將半天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開為一一五五元、與前收同價、福泰寧大德成納條、裕新祥元茂永則出、匯豐銀行掛牌英美俱平、此際盤旋於五元至五元一角之間白銀平衡稅揭曉縮半分、裕新祥元茂永成大福興水益餘俱售、退為五元、惟福泰亨慶發永限盤吸收、午收仍為一一五五元、結果與前收同價</p>

<p>華商拋售連滙一百萬　銀行停止東匯遠期買賣</p>
<p>滙市昨仍平定、日政府統制匯兌、華商轉拋大連晨初以海外電告倫敦大條、近期縮一二五遠期縮零六二五紐約銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價縮三厘半、倫敦生金勿動、英對美英對法勿動、美對英長零六二五、美對法升一八七五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、匯市晨開近期賣價英匯一先令二便士五三一二五及五六二五對搭、美匯二十九元七五及八一二五對搭、較前收討英美仍平、惟東匯稍緊、開後缺乏成交、東匯遠期、因日政府強化匯兌政策毫無對手銀行更停止遠期賣買、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅小半分、過程呆滯、大連帮乃拋出大連、價與東匯約相差一二五、由銀行努力吸收之、洋行界仍塞美金、英美烟公司則結先令、結果尚平、午收近期賣價英匯一先令二便士五三一二五及五六二五對搭、美匯二十九元七八一二五、校前收計英美俱平、華商約拋大連二百餘萬元、惟東匯反略有補進、新豐洋行供給美金英美烟公司則結先令、今將半天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>日本統制外匯　標紗復轉平穩　間時現銷亦日見清淡</p>
<p>紗市上日狂漲暴落後、氣勢轉趨平靜、加之日本統制外滙法正式公佈後、人心更見穩定、同時現紗生意日趨沉悶、而十支粗紗情形尤弱、怡和廠開出二十支五福牧羊大都向標紗市塲套賣、故近月茜軟、惟多頭因大孤三品紗市仍屬堅挺、意態末變、但一般同業以存紗漸增紗廠錠子業已開足、生產可以增加、興趣稍淡矣、</p>
<p>本月份廠方大量套賣</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因日本強化管理滙兌法公佈後、人心平定、且本月份有廠方巨量套賣、額量殊夥，市勢壓力尤重、突跌二元、遠月亦帶疲、至二盤時、大阪三品紗近期微漲一元半、中期反跌、市况愈形疲弱、同時二十支五福現紗價跌二元、客方銷路不暢、形勢益挫、迨至收盤、聞大阪三品遠期回漲三•四元、市價重振、復趨高翔、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌四•五角、午後開盤市態極為平常、交易甚少、惟多方稍有拖進加碼、而形堅挺、但現紗售價鬆落、十支紗有跌三•四元之譜、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一•二•三•九角、查實出望泰興一千五百五十包、吉豐九百包、明華一千九百五十包、廣豐八百五十包、澄記八百五十包、聚與七百五十包、仁豐一千五百五十包、永大一千五百包、同和七百包、裕大一千八百包、達記七百包、買進合興一千三百包、恒益一千八百五十包、大豐一千一百包、明德一千四百包、豐泰八百五十包、大昌成八百五十包、長豐一千八百五十包、潤康二千七百包、恒昌一千一百五十包、信誠一千零五十包、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>二十支五福狂跌五元</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚平、查全日各帮買去統計六百九十七包、售價跌二元、其中二十支五福紗狂跌五元左右粗紗市價甚疲、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市絕少進展力量</p>
<p>棉市平靜、絕無精彩可言、兼之海外行市亦不脫盤旋之局、至於現棉銷塲、殊覺呆純、廠方亦少採辦、存棉未見减少、故市勢平穩、</p>
<p>標花行市略回</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉回跌、印棉漲跌互見、兼之東洋棉市回跌後、人氣轉定、塲中買戶缺乏、交易甚稀、迨至收盤、因紗市復升、棉市帶好、結果近月比上日收盤價漲一二角遠期勿動午後開盤、市情無甚進出、形勢軟化交易亦少、結果各月比上午收盤價漲跌五分至一角、查賣出明德一千七百擔、振大一千一百擔、泰昌一千八百擔、潤康三千一百擔、恒益二千擔、源大一千一百擔、森康一千二百擔、望泰興一千九百擔、買進通記一千一百擔、慎記一千擔、長豐二千七百擔、協成一千擔、大慶一千擔、合興二千八百擔、經華一千六百擔長和一千二百擔、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現棉廠銷轉懈</p>
<p>現棉消費呆滯、廠需岑寂、來原計姚花一千六百八十包、通州花一千</p>
<p>美棉有將輸往德國</p>
<p>作美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、國內外同業買進、各月漲一至七磅音、旋以正月期交割通知單發表七紙、多頭了結、同時買方恐低級棉壓迫、將近月多至遠月市價同疲、現棉脚地堅昂、布市活動、德美交換貨物計劃、已經完成、將有美棉輸往德國收盤前、多頭了結及新賣戶又起、幸收盤時有補空及同業買進、計現貨跌六磅音、期貨跌一至八磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲三至六點、印棉因日本統制外匯、大批賣出而跌、後因本地廠家出口商及投機家買進而回、計平果爾漲○•五至○•七五羅比、奧姆辣跌○•二五至一羅比、白羅溪跌○二五羅比、原電錄左、（八日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、九日開盤預測、白羅溪、為二百二十八羅比半、奧姆辣為二百零五羅比七五、平果爾為一百七十七羅比、均跌一羅比</p>
<p>三品紗花漲勢未衰</p>
<p>九日大阪電、三品期紗漲五角至四元七角、近月為二百七十九元九角、遠月為二百六十四元、期棉跌二角至漲六角五分、近月為七十三元二角、遠月為七十六元七角、疋頭</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>東貨布疋售盤不支　亦受日政府統制匯兌影響　細布細斜三日跌去一二角</p>
<p>棉布市面、自日政府宣布強化統制匯兌後、先時硬治之東疋現貨售盤、卽難支撐、且現銷益談、年關轉瞬又屆、致跌勢益形尖銳、三日來白細布。細斜每⽦各跌一二角、絨布印花絨彩條絨落令之貨、每疋狂落三•五角至一元不等、深色印花布疋以存貨擁擠、售盤亦見步挫、色布及直責綫呢嗶嘰均呆滯不前、各廠存貨逐步增盛、惟廠方以紗綫及一般物料較前莫不大昂、因成本關係、且客帮無實際辦胃、故均採靜觀態度、不顧念切削價求售、春令貨條素府綢續有定貨成交、遠路天津•廣東•雲南•長沙•已陸續來採購現貨、箱額不多。日進貨紗綫府綢坯布連日到滬大旺、均係上年底華商染廠及布號之定貨云、</p>
<p>大衣呢類依然暢銷　售盤因貨缺上漲</p>
<p>呢絨交易近頗沉寂、蓋賣方因夏歷年底關係、都不再放賬、及拒用雜遞支票、買方因之除急銷候用貨外、亦少進貨、昨馬褲呢•克羅丁•色子買•波蘭大衣呢等、銷路則仍暢達、馬尾襯•馬鬃袖裹•實銷正旺、故仍貨缺價昂、若姜山九寸馬尾襯、昨原⽦現交統已漲至二角七分、馬鬃袖裏現貨更快、買方候用頗亟、價出六角半尚之現貨開進、馬褲呢•克羅丁•頭號一律沽八元、黑灰及貨元色售八元六七角、</p>

<h3>證券</h3>
<p>公債市場僅有散戶活動</p>
<p>昨日公債市况、上下極微、趨勢亦甚呆滯、以環境之靜寂、益形平淡、亳無生氣、大戶亦極少進出、檯面僅散戶交易居多、市價因多空呆持、祇以三五萬之數、卽可制定其升降、沉悶之現象、殊屬少見、復興公債極少人問津、遠期開出、仍為七十三元、當上午開盤、散戶頗多賣出、七十七號亦略有拋賣、四十三•四十五號則在吸收、除戊種本月及乙種下降五分一角、餘均上漲一二角、次盤趨勢續見盤旋而上升、以四十五•十號收買較勤、餘均係零星散戶交易耳、市價一律好起五分至二角、下午開盤、戊種本月好起一角半、遠期起為三號拋賣頗屬不少、市價均跌回疲一二角、五•四十七號仍多買進、收盤人心益形清閒、交易亦極為缺乏、除戊丁甲種遠期下降五分一角、乙丙等回漲五分及二角半、全日結果漲多跌少、成交總數、計三百九十五萬五千元、茲將其漲跌高低比較列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>去年滬絲出口大衰　比减一四、五七九包</p>

<p>鉛絲　新絲前昨海外市面、又見挺秀、故本埠行情益俏、刻市每担估十四元、比前又好半元聞軍需及內地客帮、連日頗多採辦、故執有現貨之同業、心思高昂、對於開價、咸不肯放鬆、</p>

<h3>稅務署發表去年下半年統稅收入激增</h3>
<p>走私影響印花稅短收　統礦兩稅有顯著進步</p>
<p>財政部稅務署管轄統礦印菸方各稅、二十五年度開始以來、（自二十五年七月起至十二月止）已屆半年、所收各項稅欵、現經該署分別審核、先作初步之統計、總計半年來、共收國幣八千三百六十七萬一千餘元、比較上年度同時期、計增收一千六百七十餘萬元、茲探錄該署各稅收數、與上年同時期比較數、分誌於下</p>
<p>上列各項、惟印花短收較鉅、其原因係冀省收數大减、或因商業上銷路、受走私影響所致、菸酒稅亦略有虧短、至統礦兩稅盈收之數、統稅以捲菸為大部份、棉紗水泥薰菸次之、半年有此顯著進步、實為開辦統稅以來所未有云、</p>

<h3>日本統制外滙後滬市日滙交易混亂</h3>
<p>外商銀行紛紛拋售　日商購進竭力維持</p>
<p>新聲社云、日本公布外國匯兌管理法、寶行統制外匯後、滬市日匯交易混亂、外商紛紛拋售、日商鉅額購進、維持匯價、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>交易混亂</p>
<p>眸日中央銀行公布日匯行市為一百零三日元、合國幣一百元、英商匯豐銀行公布日匯行市為一百零三日元三七五、合國幣一百元、但市塲交易甚為混亂、各外商銀行（除日商外）及華商銀行、對於日匯紛紛拋售、所以匯豐銀行昨日公布之行市、較前日降落二角五分、而中央銀行昨日公布之行市、並無實際交易、則證明日匯貶值、</p>
<p>日商維持</p>
<p>日商銀行如橫濱正金•臺灣•朝鮮•住友•三菱•三井•上海•漢口•等為維持日匯行市、目的務使其不致狂跌、所以昨日起、鉅額購進、竭力穩定、除日商外、其他各國商人、竟無購進者、今日商銀行雖竭力穩定、但是否能維持過去、實為目前一大問題、</p>
<p>外匯行市</p>
<p>日匯貶值與其他各國外匯、如英美德法港等無關、所以昨日中央銀行之外匯行市、均甚穩定、倫敦一先令二便士半、紐約三十美元、巴黎六百三十法郎、柏林七十三馬克五、香港九十七港元、匯豐銀行之外匯行市、英匯一先令二便士三七五、美匯二十九元三七五、法匯六百二十九法郎、德匯七十二馬克五、港匯九十六港元七五、</p>

<h3>以最低標準定一年中工作計劃</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>在每一年的開始時，大致每一位小朋友，總者是立下着一個再也完備不過的計劃的。今年開始時，我要奉勸小朋友們，最好從小處着眼，從自己最低的能力做起。茲試述數則如左！</p>
<p>日積一分　任一般小朋友的儲蓄計劃中，總愛預定着每天储蓄一角，或二角。若能每天儲蓄一二角，果然最好，然而每日儲蓄一二角，那不啻已把自己的零用錢，完全儲蓄了。三天五天，沒有問題，但日子長了，眼瞧着同學們吃點心，吃糖果，未免眼紅，而不免自己後悔了，不該這麽的完全儲蓄着，累得手裏這麽的沒錢。於是乎便不高興儲蓄了，而前功盡棄。所以我現在提倡着日積一分，以養成儲蓄的習慣。好在區區一分錢，自然不會影響到你們的零用上去的。</p>
<p>日行一善　在預定計劃時，可不必預定着救國家，救民族等等大問題，最好是預定着日行一善，或是每日須勞動一下子。例如在街上走路，見小販打翻了担子，便幫他拾起來。見街旁有香蕉皮，便拾起而丟入垃圾桶等等，都是。若是預定每日須勞動一次的，那麽，如掃地，揩窗等等，都可。這些，瞧着似乎沒甚大意義，然而在服務精神的修養方面，是很有用的。一個人若能自小便養成服務精神，長起來，是不愁不會見義勇為的。</p>
<p>日識一字　日識一字，似乎太少，然而我人若能實實在在的日識一字，已很夠了。這裏的所謂日識一字，是須加以說明的。譬如識一個“天”字，我們並非說認識這個“天”字的面目，知道“天”字的讀音，和會得寫，就算了，最低的限度，須得完全明暸這個“天”字的意義，以及有關於“天”字的種種名詞，形容詞等，那麽，將來不拘在那裹，讀到“天×”；或是“×天”，便能完全明白了。若是更能懂得這個“天”字的用法，那自然是更好了。</p>
<p>這裏的所謂“日積一分”，“日行一善”，“日識一字”，不過是一個最低的標準，若是能力稍強的，自然，儘可改“一”為“二”，或改為“三”，都無不可，最要的，是須始終如一。若是“日積二分”，有些困難，寗可“日積一分”，以免中輟。若是第年的成績佳妙，那麽，從第二年起，不妨把所定的標準，略略提高一些兒。這麽的循序漸進，十年之後，準成為有恒心，有責任心，很節儉，而且是很有智識的一位青年了。</p>
<h3>四小傑</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>雖當垂暮之年，在這氣象維新的元旦日子，瞧若四個年歲相同長成相仿競呼他外公的同來拜年的孩子，李老的老懷中平添了無限的欣慰。他含笑招呼他們走近些，慈祥地說道：“眞巧，你們這四個孩子恰是一年所生，今天可說都是十一歲了，現在，你們都在學堂裏念書，為着將來做人作準備。可是你們想學些什麽本領，日後幹些什麽事情，你們可以掄着長幼的次序，各人試向我述說一下。……元兒，你的生日最先，你先講。</p>
<p>於是趙元站前一步，朗聲答道：</p>
<p>我國素來沒有完備的法律，人民不知法律的意義，所以人心多壞，一切未上軌道。我願意學習法律，努力造成一個法治的國家。</p>
<p>錢亨不待呼喚，逕自接口：</p>
<p>“法律固應修明，未免有些以力服人，努力之下最好的效果是所謂‘民勉而無恥’。我想學習美術，希望運用着美育化人，提高大衆的精神文明，可達到世辦大同之域。”</p>
<p>孫利，因為同伴們在平日間　根據他的行止替他題有一個“小商人”的綽號，他正待開口，先自忸怩。禁不得衆人的摧促，他老實發表：</p>
<p>“大家知道我的父親是一個生意人，我也但願能得繼承父業，不過是要勉圖發展的。師長說過：‘國富則民強。衣食足而後知禮義。’要知理財之道是該學習經濟的罷？”</p>
<p>最小的李貞一整衣袂，侃侃而談：</p>
<p>“武力萬能！惟武力可以制勝一切！在這強權的世界，整軍經武，鞏固國防綫是要圖。我很有意於軍事學，要做一個雄視全球的人物！”</p>
<p>斬釘載鐵般的言語出於有勁的口齒，大拇指不禁豎起來了！</p>
<p>雖然各人的思想不同，他們都不失為有志的小國民。李老很高興地各就他們的志向着實勉勵了一番。</p>
<h3>卡通玩忽的小黑貓</h3>

<h3>爆竹一聲</h3>
<p>— 路爾鈺</p>
<p>爆竹一聲，</p>
<p>除舊更新，</p>
<p>試想，</p>
<p>我們有沒有添了一點新的學問！</p>
<p>新的習慣，好的性情？</p>
<p>早起沒有？</p>
<p>勤讀沒有？</p>
<p>清潔沒有？</p>
<p>過去這一年，</p>
<p>值得我們大家反省？</p>
<p>不是穿新衣，</p>
<p>戴新帽，</p>
<p>看一塲電影，</p>
<p>這便是“年”的“新”</p>
<p>過一年，大一年，</p>
<p>年年的責任加增，</p>
<p>聽一次爆竹，你要作一次準備，</p>
<p>如何推開國家的厄運</p>
<p>如何立志作一個新人</p>
<h3>一個化學玩意兒</h3>
<p>— 王志定</p>
<p>電光枝</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們：新年到了，我們來做幾個對於學問上有帮助而且極有興趣的遊戲，這里我來告訴你們一個化學玩意兒。</p>
<p>這個化學玩意兒的名字呌“電光枝”。我想小朋友們一定會說沒有聽到過吧！可是找可担保你們都見過。那就是一根銅絲，上端塗有灰鹽色的藥粉：只要用自來火一點便會燒起來，同時發出來許多針一般的火花：（見圖）一直到藥粉燒完為止。因為火花像針，所以許多人不呌它“電光枝”而呌做“點點針”。</p>
<p>小朋友們！這個東西不是見過了嗎？</p>
<p>到廣貨店里去買一根大槪要四五文錢，可是我們自己來做就不要這末多。同時自己來做更覺得有趣，而對於學問上也有些帮助。</p>
<p>現在就來講做法吧！</p>
<p>應用藥品——织粉一分，硫黃華一分，硝石五分，鎂粉三分。（合計不到二角。）</p>
<p>另外用品——膠水銅絲（或鐵絲。）</p>
<p>先把硝石和硫黃華研成細末，然後和鋁粉，鎂紛混合起來；再加上膠水，用筷子調和；於是可以用毛筆　潤濕塗在銅絲的上端。（要途得勻。）塗好後放在太陽下晒乾，（見圖）這樣，一根“電光枝”便成功了。</p>
<p>當“電光枝”着火燒起來的時候，我們不要見那火花怕：這火花是沒有危險的。碰到手不會感到痛，碰着紙張也不會燃燒；因為它不能持久的。</p>
<h3>世界各強國飛機的數字</h3>
<p>— （寗自強）</p>
<p>小朋友！自從大家獻機祝壽以後，各位對於飛機的重要，當然是印象很深，它不僅是充實國防，抵禦外侮，也是現在各國唯一的競爭的利器啊！現在把世𠇚各強國飛機的數字，報告給諸位。</p>
<p>蘇俄　七千一百五十架</p>
<p>法　五千二百架</p>
<p>英　三千六百架</p>
<p>美　三千六百五十架</p>
<p>意　二千八百架</p>
<p>德　三千架</p>
<p>日　一千九百架</p>
<p>看了以上各國的空軍設備，反觀我國遠莫能及，正是“渺蒼海之一粟”了。</p>
<h3>快刀</h3>
<p>— 懷良</p>
<p>預備同樣高低同樣大小的碗兩個筷子或別的竹條一根，它的長要比兩個碗的直徑再要長二寸。切菜刀一把。</p>
<p>玩的時候，將兩個碗各盛了八分滿的水，並列在一塊木板上，兩個碗距離約一寸，將筷子放在兩個碗上。</p>
<p>最要注意的，這根筷子要放在兩碗中央。筷子的兩端要在碗治之外，如果差些、就要失敗的</p>
<p>看的列位朋友，如果這一刀把筷子砍斷了，你道這兩碗的水要受影響嗎？那自然罷！不是碗被壓碎，就是水花亂濺起來的了！不對的，這兩碗和水都不受影響的，碗也不會碎，水也不會亂飛的。</p>
<p>你不相信，你看試試看，舉起菜刀，向筷子的中心點“撲筷”一聲，用刀斬下去，祇見噹子分做兩段，碗裏的水動也不動。小朋友，不是很有趣麽？</p>
<h3>血液</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>有一天，敏兒一不小心，把他手上皮膚破裂了，鮮紅色的血液便很快的流出來，使他的一隻左手沾滿了鮮紅的顏色。</p>
<p>“快快的他手紮起來，不要讓血再流出來才好，聴兒根急的對他說，一面迅速地去拿止血的藥水。</p>
<p>他們倆忙了好一陣，敏兒左手上的血才漸漸的停止流出來了。</p>
<p>“你不要太膽大，這不是一件游戲的事，血是一種很重要的東西，不可讓它多流出來，多流出來是有危險的”，聴兒不是像從前那樣嬉戲般的，而是一本正經的對他那個年幼無知的弟弟說明。</p>
<p>“哥哥，我手上的血已經止住，那不要緊了，你瞧，這淡黃色的液體是甚麽東西。”</p>
<p>“這淡黃色的液體是從血液在凝結的時候分泌出來的，由此可知血液並不是一種單純的液體，其中還有很多的固體，那固體便是血球，液體便是血漿，所以在血液中，固體和液體大約各佔一半。</p>
<p>“你所說的血球是不是白血球的血球？”</p>
<p>“你要知道血球中含有白血球和赤血球。這白血球是我們人體抵抗外來有害於身體的微菌的侵入，如果抵抗不過它們，那人便要生病了。但是白血球是一種奇怪的東西，它能自由行動，沿着微小的管壁匍匐着，它能穿過這微血管壁，游出管外，而吞食外來的病菌，但它的數目很少，大約是赤血球五百個，才有白血球一個。赤血球中含有黃紅色的血色素，因血色素的不同，所以有現在世界五大人種——紅，黃，白，椶，黑五種。</p>
<p>“那麽血液對於人體有什麽功用呢？）</p>
<p>“血液對於人體的重要，好此一個國家中的人民，血液在人體中周流不息，一方面把人髓已製成的滋養料，輸送到全身各部，另一方面把全身的廢物排出體外，如果血液一停止流動，那人便要死了。但血液的流動完全依靠心的跳動。”</p>
<h3>孝（十一）</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>瑪麗皇太后是一位最和善最質樸的婦人。伊在私室中接見稍絲可菲，非常溫和的聽着伊訴說伊的故事；聽罷之後，就滿口稱讀伊的老道當下就昝允替伊向皇帝去說情，並且賜給伊三百盧布，以供伊目前的應用。柏絲可菲感激得什麽似的。簡直說不也一句話來。事後維夫人問伊朝見皇太后的情形，伊直快樂得流下淚來。</p>
<p>兩天以後，瑪麗皇太后親自帶伊去見皇帝和皇后伊麗莎白。皇帝和皇后聽了伊的一切經過，很為感動，對伊十分優待，答尤重行審問伊的父親，伊臨行時更得了五千盧布的賞金。</p>
<p>柏絲可菲自從進了皇宮之後，那些不很注意於伊的人們，立時注意起來了。……他們都讚伊的臉兒長得美　說伊自有一種大家的風範，紛紛的請伊到他們的家裏去。然而柏絲可菲却仍然很鎮靜，並沒有什麽得意忘形的表示：供從不想到自身的安樂，也從不因結果的良好而驕傲，只保守着伊的一片天眞，接受人家好意的欵待。有　位貴婦人曾帶伊去參觀皇宮中許多壯麗的殿廳，伊們將皇帝的寶座指給伊瞧，伊便突然的站住了脚，驚喜的喊起來道：“這原來就是寶座嗎？我在西伯利亞時想起了它，就害怕得什麽似的！”在這一瞬之間，伊那過去的一切希望與失望，憂慮與恐怖，好像潮水般湧上心來。又舉手呼道：“好一個皇帝的寶座！”興奮得幾乎暈了過去。接着伊要求許可伊走近前去，雙膝跪了下來，用嘴親着座前的階級，仰天呼道：父親！父親！你瞧，上帝的權威，引導我到了什麽地方！我的上帝，賜福於這個寶座——賜福於那位坐在這寶座上的聖天子——使他得到無限的快樂，好像他自己使我快樂一樣”！那時那兩位貴婦人，幾乎沒法使伊離開寶座，老是跪在那裏不走，可是伊因為興奮得太厲害了，一時筋疲力竭，再也不能繼續參觀下去。</p>

<h3>一年來的中國世界語運動</h3>
<p>— 岡林</p>
<p>一九三六年是一個苦難的年頭。民族敵人對中國的侵略達到最嚴重的階段，國內救亡運動的浪潮到處洶湧澎湃着。世界語運動在這樣的環境裏，究竟有了一些什麽進展呢？</p>
<p>第一，世界語已被應用到救亡運動上。在過去，一般學習世界語的人，多是拿世界語作為自己的求知或享樂的工具，好像學了世界語便可以多讀許多書，達到自己的求知的目的，或者藉世界語來進行國際通信，結交許多外國朋友，交換交換書報，畫片，郵票之類，以滿足自己的追求趣味的慾望，但在這一年裏，國內世界語者很少表現出這種由個人主義出發的企圖。在北平，上海，廣州，都有大羣的世界語者用着世界語來參加救亡運動。他們在“為中國的自由解放而用世界語的口號之下，組織了國際通信團體，發刋了通信刋物，如北平的“無綫電”（Radio)，上海的“中國怒吼了”（Cinjo　Hurias)，都在這一年裏盡了很大的向國際人士報導中國現狀的任務。尤其是後者，能坦白地客觀地把中國的苦難的現狀儘量地向國際人士報告，曾獲得他們很多的好評。同時各地的世界語者也翻繹過許多國外通信在國內各刋物上發表，如關於西班牙的內戰，曾供給國內刋物很多寶貴的材料。這些都證實了世界語運動在民族解放運動上的意義的重大，和現代世界語者已確實擔負起應用世界語來參加救亡運動的任務。</p>
<p>第二，運動的普遍的展開。我們不能否認，在許多地方，如昆明，長沙，福州，貴陽等處，在這一年裏世界語運動是相當的沉寂。但在其他地方如北平，上海，廣州，武昌，杭州，南寗，天津，香港等處，却有很大的新的進展，新的世界語者大量地產生出來。其他內地各縣，個人學習者也比往年為多，這只要看上海方面初級用書，字典辭典等在各地銷售數量之多，便可反證出來。</p>
<p>第三，社會人上對於世界語的理解的加深。世界語運動在中國已有三十年的歷史，但一向是不被人們注意的。近年來因世界語運動的工作者不倦的努力，如宣傳方式的進步，世界語譯作品在各刋物上的經常刋出，使得社會人士對於世界語的理解日益加深，從前還常有一些懷着偏見的人，出來阻止甚至破壤世界語運動，但在這年中却沒有這種現象了。同時，政府方面也了解了世界語運動的本質，確認世界語運動對於全國抗敵的運動有着相當的助力，因此好些團體已經當局允許了立案；如廣州，南寗，太原，世界語運動且受當局相當優厚的扶助，在工作上給與了許多便利。</p>
<p>第四，世界語出版界的活躍。在這年中，世界語出版界在數量上有着空前的收擭。最重要的書籍，僅上海一隅，就已出有“世界語國際通信集”，“初級講習用書”，“新興語言理論”，“世界語新論”，“世界語翻譯研究”，“世界語文法修辭講話”，“我怎樣學習的”，“世界的呼聲”，“世界語五十年”等多種；其他如廣州等處也出有好幾種。刋物如上海之“世界”已出版了四年，在這年中形式與內容都有改進。上海之“中國怒吼了”亦已改為鉛印。北平除“世界語之光”，“無綫電”外，新創刋的有“曙星”一種。廣州更有“地獄”，“暴風雨”之兩種新刋。杭州則有“綠洲”，香港有“新文化”，均附刋於該地日報。這種出版物的活躍，反映出世界語運動在這一年中在中國的進展是如何的迅速了。</p>
<p>一九三七年是世界語誕生的五十週年，全國兩萬餘世界語者將在這一年中做些什麽工作呢？中國世界語運動在這一年中將有怎樣的發展呢？我想這是今後文化界值得注目的一件事。</p>
<h3>中國日前的迫切任務</h3>
<p>— 葉青</p>
<p>中國近百年來的歷史，是由封建到資本移行的歷史。但世界在近百年則開始了由資本到社會的移行。因為世界是中國底環境，所以由資本到社會的移行要作用於中國由封建到資本的移行。這是不能避免的事情。</p>
<p>這種作用，依我看來，最大的是由“五四”到“一九二七”這個階段。它使我們十八世紀式的啟蒙思潮急轉直下地遇到十九世紀式的社會思潮，並使我們二月革命式的國民革命有急轉直下地過到十月革命式的社會革命之可能。那時，中國底前途有兩個：資本主義和非資本主義。但這個矛盾底解决，是把中國底革命方向移到資本主義一面去了。</p>
<p>歷史一走上某個階段，就不能隨我們主觀的心願去予以改變。它要走一個相當時期，纔能到達於其自己反對底方面。要那時我們纔能改變它底方向，使它走上一個新的階段。所以人力雖能促進歷史，但亦只能促進，它是有其不可少的自然生長性之存在的。</p>
<p>而世界之由資本到社會的移行呢？在“五四”時代有一個高潮，所以它刺激了我們底啟蒙運動，並由此激了我們底國民革命。而在“一九二七”以後，高潮早已過去。新的高潮到現在都還沒有。這簡直是一個退潮時代，低潮時代。因此，世界之由資本到社會的移行所給予中國的影響非常的小。它可以說是等於零。</p>
<p>在這兩種情形之下，那不服從“一九二七”把中國栘向資本主義的歷史决定而想再把中國由封建到資本的移行扭轉使它變成由資本到社會的移行以跳躍資本階段的企圖，歸於失敗。人工泡製的高潮只是自己安慰自己的幻想。所有的運動，不管紅軍也好，蘇維埃也好，要不過是一個沒有出息的農民運勸而已。中國底歷史仍然是在由封建到資本的移行之中</p>
<p>於是我們對於“一九二七”以前和以後直到現在的歷史，不能不給予以新的考察和新的分析。這樣，我們覺得中國底歷史從鴉片戰爭以來到現在，仍在由封建到資本的階段。“一九二七”之由資本到社會的可能，只是世界由資本到社會的轉變中的高潮給予中國以刺激而生的反應，僅能為曇花底一現。而在它不能給予中國以刺激的令天，中國底歷史要依照它自己底方向走了。</p>
<p>在這裏，我想把由封建到資本的一般過程解說兩句。這個過程是以一個革命來完成的。在由封建到資本移行中的革命，是資本主義的市民反對封建貴族的運動。通常叫做民主革命，卽反封建的市民革命。這種市民革命有三種性質：“為民主，卽反對貴族政治建立民主政治，可以英法二國底革命為代表；”為民族，卽反對封建國家建立民族國家，可以荷美二國底獨立為代表；一篇統一，卽反對割據勢力建立統一政權，可以德意二國底統一運勸為代表。任何市民革命必帶有這三種性質，以完盛其民主，民族和統一底任務。因為要這樣，纔能使歷史由封建過到資本。前述之英法荷美德意六國底市民革命，不過就其對某方面在各自底歷史條件之下有特殊的發揮而言罷了。</p>
<p>中國底歷史，在現階段旣是在由封建到資本的移行中，那也就不能有例外可言，這就是說，它要做市民革命，要發</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>揮此革命底三方面而完盡其民主，民族和統一底任務。要這樣，它𦆵能由封建過到資本，完成現階段底歷史發展。</p>
<p>依照這個見解來看現階段底歷史，市民革命是一個總的變革過程。那末，辛亥革命所表現的為這個革命底民主性質，它不是曾經推翻滿清貴族而建立過民主共和嗎？一九二七底國民革命所表現的為這個革命底民族性質，它不是曾經高呌打倒帝國主義，並以軍閥為帝國主義工具，而建立一個可譯為民族政府的國民政府嗎？一九二八以來的統一戰爭所表現的為這個革命底統一性質，它不是曾經以統一口號打倒割據勢力以建立並鞏固一個統一的中央政權嗎？這三種性質在中國展開成了三個時期，成為中國市民革命底三個任務。</p>
<p>它們在中國為基麼不能一次完盡呢？換句話說，為甚麼分成了三個時期呢？這可由中國底特殊清形來說明它。此地應注意的，是中國對於市民革命所有的三種任務只完盡任何一個都不行。如果一次革命只完盡了一個，那必須再次革命來完盡其它。事實對此，表現得很顯然。</p>
<p>或許有人說，辛亥革命並未完成民主政治，國民革命並未完成民族運動，你底分析不對。那末，請注意吧：辛亥革命之未完成民主政治，是由於那時沒有完成統一的緣故：國民革命之未完成民族運動，亦是由於那時沒有完成統一的緣故；所以統一對於民主和民族說來有關鍵底作用。</p>
<p>不統一，就有割據勢力在。割據勢力是封建的，與民主不相容。過去有一個時期大家主張省憲，以為各省有憲法，就可好一點。殊不知省憲有了，不能實行。那時，大家對於中國則主張聯省自治，以為這可以消滅割據和內戰。而在事實上則全然辦不到。所以國憲也同省憲一樣，皆因割據勢力存在，不能見諸施行。這就可見民主之為統一國家底政治形態了。不統一決沒有民主可言。</p>
<p>民族運動要成功，亦有賴於統一。十九世紀底德意志和意大利之能成為獨立自主的國家，從它們底統一運動而來。國有外患而內仍割據戰爭，完全是民族底自殺。在今天某帝國主義以分裂政策來漸進地宰割中國時，應付底方法是統一運動。不然，我為鷸蚌，敵為漁人，未有不亡國者。這在莫斯科底眞理報和新開報，都曾痛切說過。所以今天不說抗敵救亡則已，如其說抗敵救亡，就必須要完成統一。這是自明之理和不易之理。</p>
<p>那末中國市民革命底第三時期所從事的統一，便非常重要了。它不僅是當前的迫切任務，而且是完成一兩時期之革命的迫切任務。這是必然的邏輯。</p>
<p>凡把現階段底中國革命現定為市民革命（“次產階級性的民權革命”）的人，不能反對統一。並且還應該積極地要求統一，完成統一。認識統一為中國市民革命底工作，為中國由封建到資本的必經過程，為中國現在對內完成民主政治對外完成民族運動的關鍵，不僅可以使我們明白近二十五年底歷史尤其近九年底歷史，而且使我們明白我們在現階段的作務。這是一件很重要的事情。</p>
<h3>巴黎的國民音樂歌舞院</h3>
<p>— 君明</p>
<p>巴黎，這“文藝都府”，這有名的“花都”，看的玩的，眞是說之不盡。但什麽凡爾賽宮殿，什麽博物館，什麽凱旋門，都是為人所熟知的了，這裏沒有詳說的必要。除這些之外，還有一個地方在巴黎，不，甚至說在歐洲都很有名而且是很少有人特別談起過的：這個地方便是著名的歌舞劇場—“國民音樂歌舞院”。</p>
<p>巴黎的“國民音樂歌舞院”是法國國立劇塲之一，位置在巴黎的中心。現在我們所看到的它那偉大華美的建築并不是近年才建築成的：說來真有點歷史。據說遠在半世紀以前，卽一八六一年，就有一位名呌加爾•卡爾涅的建築家開始興工建築這個歌舞劇塲，至一八七四年末才大體完成，一八七五年一月五日才舉行開幕式；所費工程費三千六百五十萬法郎，收買地基費一千五十萬法郎，計共將近五千萬法郎。不過，在這之前，還經過十一次的塲所的變更，歷時約二百年，才固定在目前這個地方；同時，就是劇塲的名稱，在那長時期中也經過了九次的變更。這樣，劇塲建築的偉大可觀，它在一般劇塲中的地位和價值，也就可想而知的了。</p>
<p>的確，“國民音樂歌舞院”本身的建築就是一個藝術品。站在巴黎市中街道上，單看它的外部，已經是很可觀了；若走進內面，那更可使你驚異它設計的偉大，一切佈置的豪華。它的舞台計高十四公尺，寬五十四公尺，深二十六公尺；說它是“世界的頭等舞台”，實在並未有一點的誇大。在觀衆座位和舞台之間設有巨大的防火鐵門，很是安全。歌舞者的房室是有分別的：大概一等歌者和舞蹈者是一人一室；其他合唱團的團員或臨時雇來的人員等，大半共處一室，只是男女有所區別；二等以下的歌者和舞蹈者是二，三人至七，八人一室。此外還有劇塲的各種職員室，圖書館和博物館。</p>
<p>這個歌舞劇塲共有觀客座位一千二百個。它所使用的人員，上自總支配人下至門衛。消防夫•小工•大概有一千二百名，就中包含得有專門歌唱者約六十名，合唱團全部約百名，舞蹈者約二百名，管絃樂部員約百六十名，總計藝術部人員約計五百名之多。</p>
<p>這裏的專門歌手之任命，並沒有何等確定的規定法則，完全是由總支配人招致來的。所以實際上這些歌手雖然有許多是頂為人所稱贊的，但却不一定都是第一流的藝術家。不過，在巴黎這歌舞劇塲的歌舞却是很有名的，所有從事歌舞的人幾乎都想到這裏來找出路；只要這裏的合唱團缺少人員時，應考者的人數常常總是在需要名額的七八倍以上。</p>
<p>到這裏來應試的人員，要經過兩次試驗合格後才可錄取為社員；同時，新來的社員，在最初一年除有出塲百九十四回上演節目之義務外，每週還有三天的午後要受劇塲的訓練。還有，官立音樂學校的男女學生，因為是用宮費求學，所以，正在學習中的他們，如果這個國立的劇塲要求臨時出場時，是不能推辭的。至於一般合唱團員，則大部分都有兼職。</p>
<p>巴黎的“國民音樂歌舞院”還附設的有歌舞學校。這裏面的學生，年齡在八歲至九歲者，同時要受初等義務教育；專門受舞蹈訓練的時間，初級是五年；第一年級三年，第二年級二年。這些學生每年要舉行一次至三次的競爭試驗，合格後卽編入劇塲的歌舞團，一般所謂“Ｃotenrse的小鼠”，便是這個歌舞學校的學生。至於所有歌舞男女的地位等級，那也和各處的情形一樣，其最高者便是什麽“明星”“皇后”之類。</p>
<p>劇塲的門票共有八種：最低的是三法郎一張，最高的是六十一法郎一張。但逢每年七月十四日的國際日則向一般民衆開放一日，不售門票。</p>
<p>法國政府每年要發給這個國立劇塲二百四十萬法郎的補助金，特別委人經理，這個人便是劇塲的總支配人，當然也是政府官吏。他的任期是七年，在這七年中，他除在原來上演的節目之外，還須追加十七種新的節目，就中十四種且須是法國作曲家的作品；同時劇院在一年內還須有百九十次的賣票公演。</p>
<p>除這一般公演外，每年一月在巴黎為救濟病弱兒童的歐洲最大跳舞會——“小白臥床跳舞會”，以及巴黎Mode商人的跳舞會，都要在這“國民音樂歌舞院”裏舉行；而這兩種特別跳舞會的盛况，當然更不是平時一般跳舞會所可比擬的。</p>
<p>不過，最為一般人所不知道的，是這劇塲的神秘的地下室。在這裏面，特別使人發生興味的是那“聲音貯藏室”。詳細說來，卽是在這黝暗的地下室的一隅，可以看到緊閉着的鐵門，門內有裝着幾個鉛匣的箱子，就有這些鉛匣中，有着本世紀以來的在這劇塲的舞台上出現過的世界音樂家的聲音和作品；這些都是做成唱片放在那鉛匣中的，所以這放藏鉛匣的地方被稱為“聲音貯藏室”。</p>
<p>這個“聲音貯藏室”是一九○七年由法蘭西留聲機公司向劇院提議設立的，當時就由該公司製作了許多片子寄到劇院；以後還增加過三四次。但寄片者在寄給時曾提出一個條件，卽須在百年後才得開放，隨後又縮短為五十年；現在五十年的時光尚未過去，所以這“聲音貯藏室”還是一個秘密，其中的片子還是緊閉在鉛匣內的；要到五十年後，才由教育部長决定開放日期，實行開放；那時人們恐怕都要爭先恐後的來親聽許多有名音樂家的聲音吧，其盛况實是現在的我們所難於想像到的。</p>
<h3>跳舞的時代性</h3>
<p>— 南風</p>
<p>舞蹈藝術和其他藝術部門一樣，它底存在價值須以時代底，實際性來支持着。舞蹈藝術底歷史和進步，也都是有形無形地受着這種時代底實際性的支配的。同時，因為舞蹈藝術是時代生活的自然的表現與流露，所以，它對於時代又具有尖銳的敏感性，可說是生動的現實生活的經驗的感覺。</p>
<p>每一時代底　舞蹈，都具有這一時代底獨特“風格”。在歷史上底時代或文化的轉換期裏，人們不僅在精神方面有着發展興轉換，就是在生理以至於心理底構成上也起着變化。在這一時期底人與人間的錯綜複雜的關係，勞働以及日常生活習慣，都造成了這一時代自己底氣質和自己的姿態，構成了獨特的動律與情緒運動的規則。</p>
<p>十八世紀末葉　法國革命時代所產生的載歌載舞的瘋狂的“卡覽馬鳥兒”（Carmagnole)舞，和十九世紀中葉保守派表示復辟的愉快，所產生的“波利卡”（Polka)舞，以及十八世紀所產生的莊嚴優雅的“莫女”（Menuet)舞，這以上每一時代底形象，都印在所有廳堂舞蹈式民間舞蹈之上的。以至於近代的誇大的“華爾茲”舞，華麗的“探戈”舞，頹廢的“勃羅斯”舞，敏捷的“狐步”舞，這也是由於近代落後人羣底浪漫生活而產生的。</p>
<p>這幾種舞蹈可說是歐美各民族底歷史生活底路標。它的確遺留給我們很多的舞蹈技巧；可是如果對於這些技巧不加以整理及修飾，而仍然保持它底外形，加以接受的話，那末這種舞蹈的舞臺運動，無疑地會與生活於這一時代底人生運動，感到了不調和隔離。同時，也能夠影饗到舞蹈本身底進步</p>
<p>在蘇聯底擺蹈藝術，和其他藝術部門一樣，曾舉行了大清除與改革。變革後的蘇聯底勞働關係與日常的實際生活，都經過了一種大的變動，同時蘇聯的舞蹈藝術也追隨這種生活底定律，出現了顯著的改革與進步。</p>
<p>最初，蘇聯曾出現了幾個舞蹈藝術的天才。不過他們因為受了古典舞蹈的影饗很深，雖然想盡量地使舞蹈接近於實際生活，但往往仍不免使他們所造成的舞蹈新形式成為不過是純然的頭腦的理想，和敏銳的想像力的產物，而並不能眞實地貫澈在實際人生裏。結果還是逃不出淺薄的耽美主義度圈欄。如戈雷伊曹夫司某底跳舞劇“特姆僕•陀•珂洛姆比安”，“假面的悲劇”，“沙樂美”，“伐叛”等，可說把戈氏底藝術思想的不正確之點，充分地表明了。</p>
<p>在這些劇中所表現出來的舞蹈，的確是具有驚人的進步，和從陳腐的舊形式中突出的精紳，而造成了今日蘇聯舞蹈藝術進步底初步。可是，他在“伐叛”和“沙樂美”二劇中所表現出來的新的舞蹈形式，有些類似機械體操了，尤其是在“伐叛”一劇中在高梯子上的舞蹈，他想攝取“輕身術”的技巧，造出顯明銳利的綫條，作為藝術方面底“力”的表現，以求適於當時強有力的生活。但這種以肉體利用輕身術所表現出來的“力”的綫條，往往都有性慾飽和着，時常陷入於無注掩飾的醜的Erotic的動作裏。而也只有在這種Erotic的動作中，才能發現戈氏在他底舞蹈中所要表現的“力”的藝術來。或氏底創作之所以如此，完全是因為他所要表現力學藝術的新舞蹈形式，是以長時間積蓄的舊的舞蹈經驗，與無批判的攝取了舊式舞蹈底技巧所造成的，他底藝術是站在眞實生活以外的，他所造成的舞蹈新形式，也不過是腦筋裏的理想物，與當時底實際人生運動並不能相切合。</p>
<p>與戈氏同時齊名面被囿於古典音樂的陸金氏，當時也被一般道學家譏為“阿披阿曼的痙擎”，“性慾表現者”，不過他那銳角的，分明的，靜的表現法，是被稱道於一時的。</p>
<p>今日的蘇聯已造成了新的生活規律，在各方面可說都已擬出了具體的規範。新的舞蹈形式並不是簡單地把舊舞蹈底投術堆積起來，而是加以改編與修正來造成的。</p>
<p>最近所產出的歌舞劇與電影劇中的舞蹈節目，都表明了現階段的新舞蹈之成功。我們在只穿有運動小褲類似裸體的舞蹈中，看不出有Erotic感來，而只見到力與健康的表現。有時在爵士旅律與蹄蹋舞中，並不是空虛享樂式的Grotesquo感，倒是表示出規則的科學的集體生活來。並且還採用了軍號和大砲來伴奏着舞蹈音樂的旋律。</p>
<p>現代的舞蹈藝術，除了蘇聯，我們看不到有進步的象徵來。有的只是講求形式方面的發展，而把舞蹈造成了孤獨的性格。可以說與實生活是矛盾的，不調合的。舞蹈旣失去了時代性，所以它本身也就不能有進步的發展了。</p>
<p>我們中國更是盲目地接受了一些古典式的，和歐美的一些以享樂為目的的舞蹈。對於我們這一多苦多難的民族現實生活說來，是絕對不調和的，有毒害的。</p>
<h3>意大利古城巡禮</h3>
<p>— 迦茵女士</p>
<p>自從讀了斯塔爾夫人的“邦貝城”一文以後，對於這二千年前的古城便非常神往，不料此生眞能到此一游，請想想我的快樂與滿足罷。</p>
<p>是上午八時，我們在拿波里上岸。意大利的天永遠是晴明開朗的，所以拿波里整個兒浸浴在溫暖的日光中，大家都只穿着極輕薄窈窕的服裝。我們上岸後，便有各個旅行社的招待員前來招呼，他們都能操法語，英語或德語，所以和旅客毫不隔閡。我們選坐了飛鷹旅行社的遊覽車，這車和上海的公共汽車差不少，只沒有買票查票的手續，因為我們是整個兒租用了的。車沿着地中海的岸邊行。從車窗望出去，一邊是漫無際涯的大海，海上白浪翻飛，恰似芰荷迎風，一一偏舉，一邊是又密又茂的王黍林，微風過處，搖曳成聲，有如鳥鳴，再遠遠迎而而立的是一座龐大的火山，山口濃烟噴吐，在日光下呈硫磺色。車像電馳一般跑了兩點多鐘，才抵火山腳，山脚旁便是我們專誠來訪的邦貝古城了。城門口有一大咖啡店和一博物館。咖啡店是供遊人休息解渴的，食物很精潔，但很昂貴。博物館在咖啡店的對面，館內分為兩部，一部專陳列城內發掘出來的用具，一部則陳列城內發掘出來的死人和其他動物：兩部的中間便是進入古城去的要道。我們為了要給這古城的文化先畫個輪廓，所以先去參觀這博物館。有誰誇耀近代物質文明遠過從前的，請到這兒來看看罷！這博物館已昭示我們一千年前早已有我們今日的化學，物理等等玩意兒了，未燒毀的瓶，罐，缽，鍋，天秤，法碼，和其他一切儀器都不比我們今日實驗室中所用的簡單，粗劣。除此以外，那整箱的絲綢，那整匣的首飾，其精巧處可說是比我們現時所有的遠過多多了。可惜自發掘出來後，都已成灰，只能盛在玻璃櫥內給我們看看而已。至終所陳列的死人，大約都是當日富豪之家的主人或貴賓，說不定那時正是在衣光花影繽紛繚亂的時候，突然遭此大刦而被活埋於火山溶液之中的，所以那些女人的手腕上還有珠釗，耳上選有寶石，男的手指上還有鑽戒，但都屈背彎腰，貝齒微露，顯出當時受苦的難堪樣子來：至於其他的動物如狗，馬等，也被烈火燒得彎彎屈屈的了。這些動物，因高熱，未腐爛，而且都已成為化石。</p>
<p>參觀了博物館後，由一位年約六十餘歲的老頭子領導我們去拜訪這座偉大的古城。據這老頭兒說，這城便是給旁邊的那座火山毀滅了的，司是到現在，因了地質的變遷，那活火山已成為死火山，不再加害於人了。對於這古城，意大利政府還找了專家在經意發掘，其已發掘出來的，到現在已有很可觀的一部份了。</p>
<p>我們隨着那老頭兒在那些斷碑殘柱之間足足走了三小時的光景。可以看出全體形態的，有大劇塲，塲的屋頂自然早已給燒毀了，但座位，劇臺還完好如初，這些都是用石頭砌成的，非常整齊，仔細計算，可以容納二三千人。其次是洗操堂，據說在當日洗澡堂的性質和現在的咖啡館差不多，找朋友，談閑天，商議諸般事體都上洗澡堂去，這洗澡堂實在也是娛樂塲，所以在建築設備上加意考究，以招徠顧客；現在還可看見的是那和房間一般大的澡盆，實在也可以說是澡池，因為是用大理石砌在地裏的，水也是用自來水管輸入，澡池前面係一大廳，圖形，花磚鋪地，五彩奪目，說這是入浴以後，大家趁了肌肉興奮時而跳舞的塲所。這種情形在受過“禮敎”的中國人似乎不能想像，可是在西洋有許多的名畫都是從這兒取的材料呢。除了這兩個公共地方至今還較為完好外，其次便是一個妓館，這館的屋頂已給發掘專家用心設計補蓋上了，因為說這妓館可以代表二千年前這整個古城的全部文化；這館自成一院落，當中是個大天井，四圍是一間一間的小房間，每個房間的壁畫，地磚的花紋和色彩都各各不同，有一間的墻壁，上半截是桃紅，下半截是黑黑，但在上下兩半截之間是半尺寬的一條葱花綠帶子，帶上繪了各種姿式的愛神，一走進房間，這奪目的色彩簡直使人心蕩神移呢！還有一間，壁上畫了個大天使，天使手上提了一管秤，秤的一端是功名利祿，一端則是一個男人的生殖器，大家想想那一端最重？而在這畫中，功名利祿的一端却高高舉起來了！這便是一千年前這古城中人人的信條！人人的哲學！所以聖經上記載說這古城之遭毀滅，卽是因為荒淫過度，受了上帝懲罰的緣故。可是他們以這荒淫作出發點，却造成了羅馬帝國稱霸一時的古代文明！</p>
<p>這古城中，除了這二三處較為完整能夠窺見全豹之外，其餘都只剩些斷柱殘垣，他們那時是屬於多神教的，所以殘缺不全的大理石祭境到處皆是，而這些祭壇的形式，彫刻都不讓於今日那最好的藝術品。大家也許會很驚奇罷，在那時，全城都早有自來水的設備了，經火山掩殘後，自然毀壞了不少，但現時已給發掘人整理修復。這自來水不但能給城中每家人應用，而且還供路人解渴，所以每條街的轉角處都有一個半圓的石井欄，欄的一邊上則是各種各樣姿態的小孩，水就由這些小孩送出，或由口，或由手上捧的瓶，或由脇下夾着的鳥嘴，或者意成為孩子的小便源源流出。欄當中自然有洞，可以輸出潑濺出去的水，其構思之精巧誰說不及今人的腦袋？</p>
<p>在他們那時所沒有的，恐怕只有飛機，汽車，電車等類了。這城中的街道都以碎石鋪成，和上海西門一帶的路差不多，雖然齊整，但不如柏油路那麽平滑，街道也不寬，普通都只在五尺左右，只有到愛普羅神殿去的那一條約有丈餘寬。他們那時的交通工具是轎子和馬車，現在還有一一家安置這類交通工具的小房沒有給毀掉，那小房的地上都用彩磁鑲成他們所坐的轎子或馬車的圖樣，眞是堂皇富麗之至！</p>
<p>我們在這城中走了三小時，因頭上無遮蓋，給意大利的太陽晒得有些發昏了，忙轉身出來，到那咖啡館休息去。咖啡館裏還有音樂隊，全隊約有五六人，有小提琴，大提琴，幾達之類，還有一個唱歌者，他們都穿着燕尾服，打着白領結，油頭粉面，文質彬彬的。可是高歌一闋之後，那唱歌者便捧了一頂高冠峨峨的大禮帽，來到每個客人面前討銅板！——誰知道古時有着那麽堂皇的文明，今時又有着那麽雄厚的兵力的國家的人民，其生活情形竟是這樣的呢！我懷着無窮的疑問，隨了同行者回到船上來。</p>
<h3>神秘的生命之由來</h3>
<p>— 求實</p>
<p>人類和一切的動物者是有感覺的東西，甚至能夠言語，思想，同一切無生物如礦物之類全不相同。但是其不同的地方在那裏呢？據物理學和化舉的研究，不論有生物也好，無生物也好，有生物中的植物也好，動物也好，其化學上構成的物質基礎都不外是某些原素，更極底地剖析起來，都不外是原子電子所構成。那麽為甚麽同量原子電子組成的物體，而有些能感覺或思維，有些則無感覺不能思維呢？亦卽是說，為甚麽有些有生命，而有些又沒有生命呢？更進一步問：所謂生命究竟是甚麽東西！牠寄附於甚麽地方？牠從那兒發生？要研究生物學，這實在是一個最重要的問題。</p>
<p>歷來對於生命之發生的問題曾引起過無數次的論爭，就在現在也還是這樣。因為一般的世界觀的諸問題，哲學的諸問題之解决，興這一個問題都有不能分離的關係。</p>
<p>依照聖經所說：一切的生物都是造物主所一手造成的。生命並不是歷史的發展的產物，</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>而是萬能的神之創造物，所有的生物不具有那自己所創造的“生靈”。但是科學的進步証明了這種說法的荒謬。依據科學，生命不僅有其自身的歷史，而且生命自身也是由無生物自然發展的結巢而出現的。</p>
<p>近代科學的研究，關於生命之發生有好幾種意見，其主要的為“自然發生說”和“生命的永續說”二者。此外還有許多主張，都可以附在這二項內。</p>
<p>所謂自然發生說，認為生命係由無機的粒子之特殊的結合所發生，同時其結合是由有利的環境所產生的。但生命之自然發生，在一八六○年時法國學者巴士特就已證明疲其為不可能。在富時已經知道有機體的腐敗為特別的微生物—細菌—所引起。死了的動植物經若干時便發生破壞作用，其中有腐敗性的微菌出現。巴士特證明微生物也許從通常包含多量細胞的空氣中落入動植物之漸次腐敗的殘物之中。他作過一個實驗。取兩個裝着沸騰的肉之蒸肉罐，把一個打開，把一個封閉。在開放的一方很快地可以看見細菌的發育。在封閉的一方則沒有細菌出現。這就證明了生物不能由腐敗物中自然　生。巴士特的實驗推翻了那非科學的假設。只有中世紀的學者才斷言現在有高度組織的動物可以從微生物界的物質發生。原來生命之出現要經過非常復雜的長期間的過程，决不是一蹴就可成功的。這正如恩格斯所說：“以少量的沔水，使希望使自然在二十四小時內作出那在自然必要數千年的事，這恐徒然無理的吧。”</p>
<p>其次便是生命永續說。牠認為生命是永遠存續的；微小有機體形熊的生物充滿於宇宙各處，沒有探求牠從何種其他物質出現及其根源之必要，生命與物質同樣，最初就存在。生命是基於不滅的有機的粒子。有了適當的環境，牠便永久繼續生存。主張這種說法—“粒子論”抑“原子說—的，有一八七○年之里黑達和其後的阿勒里斯。但是關於生命的此種說法是正確的嗎？牠不與自然之根本法則相矛質嗎？就我們所如，生命界與無生命界都在不斷的發展過程中。星雲轉化成恒星與行星。行星到達某種狀態時，於其上便發現生命。生命也是依着自己的輪次，閱歷着自身發展之長期的歷史。如果說生命最初就存在，那就和宇宙的進化法則根本不合，所以生命永續說是非科學的。</p>
<p>還有一種“活力論”者，他們以為生命不能由無生的自然物發生，各生物有特別的“生活力”，一切生命現象都依存於牠。這種活力類似聖經上天神所創造的“生靈”。但化學的研究粉碎了這種說法。因為構成生命之最基礎的物質之蛋白質，現在已達到了可以由人工製造的境地了。而且那附會為生命之基礎的活力，又是否能離開有形的物質而存在呢？如果只要是一種物質就都能具有活力，那一切物質，如礦物，植物，便都該具有生命了。所以這種說法也是非科學的。</p>
<p>原來生命與蛋白質是不可分地結合着的。現在生活於地上的有機體，根本是由蛋白質構成的。因此要解决生命發生的問題，　一使必須明瞭蛋白質在怎樣的條件下可以出現。蛋白質要在一定的溫度下才能存在，如果超過八十到一百度便凝固了。細胞之蛋白質是膠質溶液，而液體也要在百度的溫度以下方能存在。所以生命之發生一定要到地球冷到百度以下的時修。據古生物學的研究，水棲動物存在於陸棲動物之先，所以海洋便是生命的搖籃了。生命之前身又依存於有機化合物。生物之所以異於無生物者，在於前者具有新陳代謝的作用，而後者則無。有機化合物能借助於光而發生新陳代謝的作用。所以生命原於有機化合物。有機物質是產生非常高度的膠質溶液的東西。在某種條件之下，膠質轉稱成凝固的塊，卽“膠凝體”。而“膠凝體”便是生物構造的端緒。總之，生命是特別地而且高度地組織了的物質的屬性，生命是由無生命的自然物發展的結果而發生的。牠是自然進化的結果，决不是突然發生的，如“自然發生說之所說：也不是同地球和宇宙同時存在的，如“生命永續說”之所說；更不是離了物質而還另有一種所謂“活力”，如“活力論”之所說。</p>
<p>生命之最初的形態是“原形質”，這就是所謂“生命形態的基礎”。其次，就是細胞。最初是單個的低級的原形質，牠僅只是具有感受性和反映性的膠質的液體，其後才進化而成為細胞。但細胞的組織便非常複雜了，中央有一細胞核，外面有細胞膜等。簡單的下等原始生物是單細胞的，只有一個細胞，牠也能新陳代謝，營獨立的生活。但一般的生物都是多細胞的。細胞之產生是取着分裂的形式，而且刻刻有舊細胞之死亡和新細胞之產生，這樣，便是成生物的生命才繼續。</p>
<p>由上面看來，生命是有其物質的基礎，而且是由進化而來的，决不是造物主之所賦與。生命旣然是高度組織的物質的屬性，那麽如果具備有這種屬性的物質消滅或死亡了，則生命也將消減或死亡了。一個人，如果全身的細胞都死亡了，那生命也就沒有了。甚麽“靈魂不滅”呵，“天國”呵，“上帝”呵，都是靠不住的。生命是有其發生，發展，死亡的。而且也只有這樣才有進化。</p>

<h3>或人的自白（五）</h3>
<p>— 法國紀德原著　湘士譯</p>
<p>是用了怎樣狂熱的愛，她照料我離開了蘇士；我是被怎樣精細的招呼，保護，幫助，照枓……包圍着呵；從蘇士到突尼期，又從突尼斯到康士坦丁，馬西林都是非常可讚嘆的。要到比斯克拉我才能復元。她的信心是很堅定的；她的熱誠沒有片刻低落。她籌劃一切，安排行程，决定住處。然而，哎！她却不能使這個旅行變得鬆快些。好幾次，我必得停下來，以為生命就要完結了。我通身出汗，恰像一個垂死的人，我氣窒，時而昏厥。在第三天的下午，到了比斯克拉，我簡址成了個死人。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>為什麽要提起從前？有什麽值得紀念的？可是討厭的回憶總是不斷地湧來呵。那時我已經不知道我是誰和在什麽地方了。我只想得起我非常軟弱地躺在床上，馬西林，我的妻，我的生命，俯在床邊看着我。找知道是她熱誠的看護，深切的愛情把我救活轉來了。像一個失舟落海的水手終於看見了陸地似的我感到一點生命的光燃起來丁；我能夠向馬西林笑了———為什麽要叔述這些？因為那時死的黑翼已觸着我，而我倒底又活了；這對於我眞是意想不到的光明與希望。從前，我眞不知這我在生活。所以現在我把生命當做一個驚異的發現。</p>
<p>我能夠起床的日子到了。我們的住處誘惑我去看一看。這其實不過是一個屋項平台。然而是一個多麽美好的平台呵！我和馬西林的房間都在這上面：高出于鄰居屋頂之上。當我們站在那最高處，便看見許多的房屋上面是棕樹，棕樹上面是太空。平台的另一面接着市立公園；豆球花的枝將牠全遮着了；平台下面有一個天井，一個很小很整齊的天井，當中栽了六顆棕樹。我的房間很大，空氣很充足，墻壁是白堊敷的，沒有掛一點裝飾品；一道小門通馬西林的房間，另一道玻璃門走出平台。</p>
<p>在這兒流过了多少不計時辰的日子！不知道有多少次，在我的寂寞中我又想起這些悠閒的情景來—馬西林在我身畔，她讀書，縫紉或寫字。我什麽也不作，我只凝視她。呵，馬西林！馬西林！我看，我看太陽，我看陰影，我看陰影的綫條慢慢移動，我想得很少，看得很多。我還是菲常軟弱；呼吸很困難；一切都使我疲倦，連讀書也如此；賓在我還要讀什麽呢，這一切已夠我怕了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Claims Diplomatic Issues Should Not Be Used as a Tool for Political Strife</h3>
<p>Expresses Great Sympathy for Foreign Minister Arita. Although there are no results at present, future development can be expected.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The voices from political parties demanding two investigations into the government's achievements in diplomacy with China and Russia and other diplomatic policies are gradually increasing. After the reopening of the Diet, diplomatic issues will definitely be the central topic of discussion. The Army authorities have always been in contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisting its policy towards China. Therefore, they expressed great sympathy for Foreign Minister Arita's dedicated efforts to adjust national relations under extremely difficult circumstances. According to the Army authorities, although diplomacy has not achieved the desired results, future development can be expected. The reason lies in China, and Japan is not solely responsible. Furthermore, Japan's international position is serious, and diplomatic issues should not be used as a tool for political strife. Army Minister Terauchi also advocated at the cabinet meeting on the 8th that the Diet should avoid using diplomatic issues as a tool for political strife and hoped that the authorities would explain the diplomatic process in detail at the Diet to dispel general misunderstandings. (Allied News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the imminent reopening of the Diet, various factions in the House of Peers are making various preparations regarding policies towards the Diet. Various factions are extremely dissatisfied with the current cabinet's diplomatic policy. Therefore, they will echo the House of Representatives and severely question the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. Furthermore, some hardliners advocate submitting a resolution to overhaul diplomacy. However, the general trend is that diplomatic issues have a significant impact on foreign relations, so an extremely cautious attitude will be adopted. Furthermore, even if a resolution is proposed, it should only be done with the intention of criticizing diplomacy. This view is also relatively strong. (Allied News Agency, 9th)</p>

<h3>A Shocking Prison Break Occurs in Qiqihar</h3>
<p>103 Prisoners Mutiny on New Year's Eve; Only 65 Captured by the 5th</p>
<p>[Tokyo] News of a shocking prison break that occurred in Qiqihar on December 31st has just been released today. It is said that 103 prisoners in the military prison there, with the connivance of some "puppet" prison guards, suddenly mutinied on New Year's Eve, kidnapping three prison officials, killing one translator, cutting telephone lines, seizing 22 rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and fleeing in all directions. However, by January 5th, local police, with the help of the Japanese "puppet" army, had captured 65 of the escaped prisoners, including 52 who, along with the leader of the prison break, a bandit leader named Fan Xian (transliteration), had been executed by firing squad in the military cemetery. The remaining 38 have disappeared without a trace since their escape, and it is now believed that they will probably freeze and starve to death in this snowy and desolate countryside.

<h3>Results of Autopsy of British Girl Murdered in Beiping</h3>
<p>Cause of death was a fractured skull caused by a blow. The elderly father wept during the interrogation.</p>
<p>[Beiping] The trial of the British girl murder case that occurred here has begun today. However, the results of the doctor's examination of the body will be delayed until next week. The girl's father, Mr. Huina, is a 72-year-old man. His hair was white, and he wept during the interrogation by the judge because he was overwhelmed with grief. It is said that on Thursday at 3:30 PM, his daughter Pamela told him that she was going to visit an old classmate and then go skating. When she did not return home in the evening, he sent a servant to look for her at the French Club skating rink. The servant returned after a while and said that the people in the rink had all left. At that time, he thought that his daughter might have stayed at a friend's house because of the bad weather, but he was still uneasy. So he went out to walk along the road by the city wall, hoping to meet his daughter, but he was disappointed and returned home. The old man wandered around until dawn, and then went out to look for her again the next morning. He walked along the road by the city wall and suddenly saw a crowd gathered by the roadside about 250 yards from his home. So he also went to investigate. He did not expect that the fragmented body he saw was his beloved daughter. Mr. Huina fainted immediately when he saw this tragic scene. After being rescued, he went to examine the body again and immediately recognized a torn skirt beside the body as his daughter's and confirmed that the watch on the body also belonged to his daughter. Mr. Huina continued that his daughter was 19 years and 11 months old and had just come to Beiping from Tianjin on Christmas Day. It is heard that the autopsy of the body was completed this afternoon. According to reliable sources, the girl's death was caused by a fractured skull from a blow by a heavy object. Based on the clues obtained so far, the girl's death seems to be mostly due to murder, because a French Club skating rink membership card full of blood stains was found near the body. The doctor's examination results stated that the blood stains were fresh and were blood that flowed while she was alive. From this, it can be seen that the girl was indeed attacked.

<h3>Flexible Measures for Settling Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the income tax on Category One profit-seeking enterprises, which began to be levied on New Year's Day this year, according to Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Provisional Income Tax Law, "The income of Category One, Sections A and B of labor-intensive enterprises may be settled once a year according to the customs of each industry." However, according to business customs, the settlement period for most industries is at the end of the Lunar Year. The income from January 1, 1937, to the end of the Lunar Year (i.e., February 10) is subject to taxation in accordance with the regulations and the date of commencement of taxation. However, the income tax is still a novel concept in our country, and many industrial and commercial enterprises may not fully understand the calculation of capital and income, as well as the reporting procedures. If they were required to report their income within three months of the settlement, as stipulated in the Provisional Regulations, taxpayers would inevitably face difficulties. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance, based on a request for extension from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, and Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government, also requested instructions from the Ministry due to difficulties in taxation. To facilitate matters, the Ministry has stipulated that for Category One, Sections A and B profit-seeking enterprises with a settlement period at the end of the Lunar Year, the income from January 1, 1937, to the end of the Lunar Year (i.e., February 10) may be reported and paid separately after the next settlement. This will be publicly announced and reported to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Talking About Japan in the New Year</h3>
<p>— Nanyun</p>
<p>On Japanese calendars, the New Calendar is printed in font size four, and the Old Calendar is printed in font size seven. In addition, the Japanese era name and various commemorative days are printed. Needless to say, the Old Calendar comes from China, and the New Calendar comes from the West. The New Calendar is more suitable, so it is placed in the main position, and the Old Calendar is only secondary. This arrangement aptly illustrates the attitude of modern Japan towards accepting foreign culture. The confluence of foreign culture and Japanese indigenous culture (which various commemorative days can represent) is what Japan is today.</p>
<p>Any culture will only be preserved and developed if it is applicable. Most of the culture that is preserved and developed is limited to what suits the tastes of the "powerful" at the time and can satisfy the interests of the "powerful" at the time. Anything that does not suit the tastes of the "powerful" or resists the "powerful" is bound to be strictly prohibited and rejected. Today, the Old Calendar is still arranged in a subordinate position on Japanese calendars, which is of course because the Old Calendar still has some use.</p>
<p>Natural science is much more fortunate than social science. Whether it is a democratic country, an imperial country, or a socialist country... natural science almost always has a value that can be realized. What about social science? Since the establishment of the Japan-Germany Pact, a special international anti-communism has achieved further contact. But it is only a contact. Japan has its own "Greater Japanism" and will never completely copy Hitlerism. Just as when Japanese Army Minister Terauchi engaged in a war of words with political parties, the political parties used constitutionalism as a weapon, and Terauchi said, "Japan's constitutionalism should be different from that of Europe and the United States." The political parties could not deny this difference. On the day the Japan-Germany Pact was announced, Asoh Hisashi, the secretary-general of the Japanese Social Democratic Party, stated that the party was originally "anti-communist," but in the same statement, he also said that the party advocated socialism. In the history of the socialist movement, there were many factions of socialism. I wonder which faction Asoh Hisashi believed in? At a symposium discussing "People's Front" and "National Front," Asoh Hisashi's biggest reason for not supporting the People's Front movement was: "Japan has its own unique national circumstances." - From this, it can be seen that the socialism of the Japanese Social Democratic Party is neither the socialism of the Soviet Union today, nor the socialism of any faction in Europe and the United States. In all likelihood, the spirit with which Army Minister Terauchi recognized constitutionalism is the same spirit with which Asoh Hisashi recognized socialism. Originally, constitutionalism and socialism, etc., are all foreign cultures, but in a country of "Imperial Way Restoration," the extent to which they can be applied is indeed very small. This is much more complicated and difficult than arranging the New and Old Calendars.</p>
<p>To make the complex simple, the military that dominates today says: "Based on the Japanese spirit..." (From the Army's booklet: Army Strengthening and Administrative Reform - page 87). To make the difficult easy, they have long said: "Abandon individualism and take collectivism, sacrifice the individual and follow the great righteousness of the country's will..." (The Essence of National Defense and the Promotion of its Strengthening). This is almost like dealing with the calendars on the monthly calendar.</p>
<p>Zhang San is a pretty boy, and Li Kui is a reckless brute. Some Chinese people love to eat Western food, and generally, Orientals love to eat "Chinese cuisine." Each country has its own peculiarities, which is originally a truth. In modern warfare, which country does not use airplanes and cannons? This is another universal truth. However, most of the military supplies imported by Japan are raw materials (metals, crude oil, heavy oil, etc.). After the raw materials are made into weapons, they are no longer foreign goods, but weapons that are imbued with the "Japanese spirit." In short, "Japanese spirit" expresses Japan's uniqueness in the international sense, but at home, it expresses Japan's national unity. If there are still inconsistencies, then strengthen control, strengthen...</p>
<p>There is no need to mention the facts of this "strengthening of control," such as "administrative organization reform," "parliamentary reform," "trade control," and "nationalization of electricity." Here are a few common examples: A few days before the New Year, the Tokyo Transportation Workers' General Federation, in order to improve their lives, made twenty-eight demands (general newspapers only published a rough outline of this demand). This is the so-called "New Year's struggle." However, although the news of mediation has been reported, what was the result? This matter has not been followed up. Recalling the end of 1935, the "Tokyo Transportation Workers" also had similar demands. Comparing the attitude of that demand from newspaper reports, it was stronger than this time. But it was also resolved under "compulsory mediation." A large-scale Tokyo tram strike like in 1934 has not occurred in recent years. This is to prove the great progress of the "Japanese spirit." In addition, although the Social Democratic Party and the Tenant and Proletarian Association opposed the military's ban on workers in its military industrial sectors joining labor unions, once an order was issued, the ban was finally carried out. Because this is an "emergency poem," one should "sacrifice the individual and follow the great righteousness of the country's will." As for the collapse of the copper mine (Osarizawa) of the Mitsubishi financial king's family, 1,600 people were affected. These disaster-stricken workers can only say that they were destined for this fate. Saying that Mitsubishi only tried to reduce costs and the equipment was inadequate is just talk.</p>
<p>In the "Japanese spirit," today is the first principle of national defense. The military's advocacy for strengthening national defense is: "...opposing class struggle, developing resources, revitalizing industry, promoting trade, and even economic control." (According to Ryuzo Kuroda)</p>
<p>Under strengthened control and strengthened national defense, the internal contradictions of Japanese society seem to have disappeared for the most part. What is leaping forward is the "Japanese spirit!"</p>
<p>In the New Year, when the "Japanese spirit" is leaping forward, it is of course a universal celebration.</p>
<p>Although the national burden has increased by 600 million compared to previous years (a large tax increase), children still want their parents to buy them kites, snacks, and new clothes.... Although Japan's trade in 1936 was not as good as in 1935 (import excess of 130 million yuan), and the expected import excess for trade in 1937 will increase to a value of 180 million yuan (Yomiuri Shimbun - January 1), the military budget has increased to more than 1.4 billion yuan, and since January 1, the global naval development competition has entered the era of no treaties. Therefore, at least the boom in the military industrial sector can embellish the prosperity of Japanese society.</p>
<p>This is a country of cherry blossoms. Although the cherry blossoms have not yet budded, the cherry blossom-like colors of women's clothing, the cherry blossom-like decorations of stores..., everything looks beautiful and full of smiles.</p>
<p>The elephant under President Hitler's rule has also come to Tokyo at this time, along with other exotic wild animals, for the sake of friendly relations. The elephant is a symbol of peace. As the elephant comes to the East, how peaceful will 1937 be in the East?</p>
<p>Japan's right-wing political parties have already begun to engage in construction. The work of the Islamic Cultural Promotion Association (established in Tokyo in November 1936) is also progressing with each passing day. As a result of discussions between the three provinces (Army, Foreign Affairs, and Education), the number of students from "Manchukuo" studying in Japan has also been decided to shift from quantitative development to qualitative improvement. This year, about 500 students are planned.</p>
<p>A few kites are bound to break their strings in the New Year, if the wind is too strong.</p>
<p>Even watching Japanese children fly kites, one cannot forget that they are in a foreign country, because the kites in Japan are mostly painted with "Bushido."</p>
<p>Talking about Japan in the New Year evokes even more homesickness. (January 1, 1937.)</p>

<h3>The Unity of the Chinese Nation</h3>
<p>— Gu Jiegang</p>
<p>A group with the same bloodline is called a race. A group with a common historical background, way of life, and a united national sentiment is called a nation. In our country, everyone has long been familiar with the fact that it can be divided into five ethnic groups, so after the Xinhai Revolution, the banner of "Five Ethnic Groups United" was raised. We may as well follow the general concept for the time being and say that there are five races in China; but we firmly believe that there is only one Chinese nation within China's territory. The interests, honor, and disgrace of the races in this nation are consistent. Separating them will hurt everyone, and uniting them will make everyone prosperous. If we want to make China an independent and free country, we must first start with uniting the various races within the country.</p>
<p>We should know that the people currently regarded as belonging to the five races and the areas in which they live were formed during the Qing Dynasty. Before the Qing Dynasty, due to war, conquest, migration, and assimilation, bloodlines had been mixed countless times, and regions had been moved countless times. Therefore, the Han race had already incorporated the blood of other races, and the other races also had Han blood. It is impossible to find a pure race. Especially the Han race. According to legend, when Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, "If the feudal lords use the rites of the Yi, they should be Yi; if the Yi and Di advance to China, they should be Chinese." He only recognized the similarity of culture and not the difference of bloodline. Later generations also accepted this view, so anyone who was willing to join could be accepted, and their bloodline was particularly complex. Therefore, we can further say that we only have an awareness of national culture and no prejudice against racial bloodlines. We have long had a very advanced nationalism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in order to facilitate separate rule, the Manchu Qing Dynasty strictly implemented a policy of alienating the various races. They could not marry each other, nor could they travel, which made their feelings very alienated. Many unequal laws were also established, and many unequal treatments were imposed, forcing strong suspicion and hatred among the various races. Originally a family, they were separated by the political tactics of the Qing Dynasty, so the residences of the four races surrounding the Central Plains clearly demarcated their boundaries, and the view of race gradually became strong. After the founding of the Republic of China, there should have been an opportunity for integration. However, because the general public had been obstructed for more than two hundred years, they were too indifferent to this issue and could not create public opinion. The government was too busy dealing with internal and external troubles and could not pay special attention to this aspect. Even today, the alienation and suspicion between each other have not been eliminated. However, the encroachment and annexation of powerful enemies no longer allow us to ignore it. If we want to promote nationalism, we must enable the various races in the country to achieve a state of cooperation.</p>
<p>When I say this, people living in the inland areas may not feel the urgency of this need. In fact, the Chinese people lack common sense in this area. A Mongolian youth once complained to me, saying, "When we go to the inland areas to study, classmates often ask me, 'What are the differences between your Mongolian customs and our Chinese customs?' They don't think that Mongolia is part of China!" I only felt ashamed when I heard this. Students are like this, let alone others! This attitude of taking the Han people as the standard of China and excluding other races from China is naturally most likely to arouse the uneasiness of other races. Imperialist countries know that the feelings between our various races are too alienated, so they use deceptive means to carry out divisive movements. Therefore, they use various opportunities to forcibly seize our territory and establish a certain country; they also use money to buy off traitors in our country and do everything possible to disrupt and brew the organization of a certain country. The Han people are careless, the other races are fooled, and the enemy reaps huge profits without any effort. If we do not take precautions and prevent future hidden worries, it is foreseeable that the lively races in our country will successively become dull puppets and perish together!</p>
<p>Among the various races in the country, the Han race naturally has the highest culture, occupies a leading position, and assumes the responsibility of guidance. However, it is natural that the older brother has more knowledge than the younger brothers, and there is no reason to be proud. Moreover, if the Han people reflect on themselves, they have no reason to be ashamed. May I ask, do the Han people have the fervent faith of the Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan people who sacrifice everything for religion? Do the Han people have the martial spirit of the Mongolian and Hui people who are good at riding and shooting and can eat and sleep on horseback? Do the Han people have the asceticism of the Hui people who abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and other addictions? These habits are the driving force for the revival of our nation and are invaluable. The culture of the Han people is indeed brilliant and admirable, but when the bottom layer is uncovered, there is only the "retreating" thinking of the Huang-Lao school, which leads to only seeking enjoyment, unwilling to sacrifice, only caring about personal and family interests, and not knowing society. The national spirit has reached an extremely precarious point. We are still in time to absorb the strengths of other races, so how can we use arrogant eyes to look at people!</p>
<p>If we Han people can use equal eyes and compassion to look at the various races in the country, and if we can recognize the needs of the times to awaken their national emotions, then we should thoroughly abolish the misconception of "appendages," and do our best to enhance mutual understanding, so that the various races in the country can truly unite and become a solid nation. In other words, we must not only unite in name, nor can we force unity under private interests and pressure, but we must achieve sincere unity in sympathy and cooperation: we must live in mutual peace in order to exist together and achieve an independent and free position in the world.</p>
<p>How can we unite? I think there should be preliminary work in the following three aspects.</p>
<p>First, in terms of material, is economic construction. The poverty of the people in the border areas is an undeniable fact, but the border areas are full of undeveloped resources. Not to mention that minerals are still hidden in the mountains, the livestock that the people in the area rely on for a living often die in entire groups due to the lack of medical equipment. After slaughter, bones, horns, fur, and feathers are discarded all over the ground, preventing materials from being used to their full potential. We should encourage agricultural and industrial experts to go to the border areas to guide the local people to improve production technology so that they can develop on their own. Inconvenient transportation is also a major reason hindering development. Today, it is far more difficult for us to go to Xinjiang and Tibet than it is to go to Europe and the United States. How can we seek production cooperation in this way? Therefore, railway, highway, waterway, aviation, postal and telecommunications networks should be established in order to circulate information and facilitate transportation throughout the country, and to reap the benefits of regional specialization.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of spirit, is cultural construction. Each race has its own unique culture, and full mutual understanding must be sought. The first thing to pay attention to is the introduction of language and writing. The four languages ​​of Han, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan are all national languages ​​used in the Republic of China today and should not be neglected. Schools in Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan areas should focus on local languages ​​and writing, supplemented by Chinese. Schools in the interior should focus on Chinese, supplemented by Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan languages. We must not only preserve local languages ​​and writing, but also develop local literature and art and enrich their intellectual heritage. Only in this way can the various different cultural elements in the country understand the various cultures in other cultural groups.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of administration, is the granting of positions to talents from the border areas and the removal of the corrupt forces of the old Han people. Are there no talented children in the border areas? It's just that they are far from the central government and cannot be known to the government. If we can establish more schools due to the development of resources in the border areas (schools that do not violate their customs, religions, and social organizations), then it will be like land that has just been reclaimed. Due to the abundance of soil, great production will be obtained, and it can be asserted that special talents will emerge. As for the corrupt forces of the old Han people, they disregard the overall interests of the country, exploit the inadequate protection of local people by national laws, bully the good, exploit heavy profits, and fraudulently obtain goods, without exception. They are an obstacle to cooperation and must be removed. Otherwise, the local people will forever misunderstand that the Han people are seeking private interests and look at us with suspicion. Our sincere cooperation will not be able to gain their trust.</p>
<p>The unity of the Chinese nation is a major issue. The purpose of this article is only to arouse the attention of the Chinese people to this aspect. A detailed plan cannot be fully explained in a single article. I hope that everyone will always keep this issue in mind, discuss it together, and deal with the current urgent situation.</p>
<h3>German Troops from Spanish Morocco Invade</h3>
<p>France Protests to Spanish Rebels and Exchanges Views with the British Government</p>
<p>Rabat, French Morocco: According to reliable sources, approximately two to three hundred German soldiers have landed separately in various ports in Spanish Morocco. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Casablanca, French Morocco: It is learned that in the past ten days, a large number of German troops have landed at the port of Melilla in Spanish Morocco and are stationed there. These German troops are fully armed and in uniform. In addition, three German destroyers and several submarines are anchored in the port. A number of German engineers and specialized workers have also arrived at the recently opened iron mine in the same region. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] According to various sources, Germany is undertaking significant activities in Spanish Morocco, North Africa. The British and French governments are exchanging views on this matter. Foreign Secretary Eden had a lengthy conversation with the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin. It is generally believed that Corbin informed Eden of various disquieting news obtained from Paris, stating that a large number of Germans had arrived in Spanish Morocco, setting up new barracks, procuring military supplies, and preparing to build fortifications along the coast of Ceuta. The French Consul in Tetouan, the capital of Spanish Morocco, in the name of the French Resident General in Morocco, has already made representations to the local authorities, requesting them to take note that the landing of foreign troops in Morocco is not permitted under current international treaties. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The British and French governments have been exchanging information on this matter for more than two months. Yesterday, the British Cabinet held a meeting, paying particular attention to the recent developments in the Spanish situation. It is reported that France's concerns are largely due to the propaganda of Germany and Italy among the Moroccan natives. This propaganda has given the Spanish Moroccans a hope that they will gain more, and perhaps even achieve autonomy, if Spain is ruled by the Nationalist forces. This has also caused unrest in French Morocco. The British government is currently considering the matter and awaiting further information from its own sources, but does not view the matter as particularly serious. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] This afternoon, members of the Cabinet who were in London convened another meeting at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street to continue discussing the Spanish situation. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to official sources tonight, the French government has made representations to the Spanish Nationalist authorities, asking them to take note of the 1912 Morocco Treaty signed between France and Spain, which stipulates that France and Spain mutually guarantee that no foreign troops are allowed to enter Moroccan territory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received reports that the Spanish Moroccan authorities had planned to build barracks to house German troops. Therefore, the French government made the aforementioned representations to the Nationalist authorities. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Well-informed sources say that the various rumors from the French side are too absurd and do not require formal denial. Their purpose is merely to influence world public opinion. At the same time, it is reported that the Oldenburg-Portuguese Shipping Company of Hamburg, Germany, has decided to extend its route to Morocco and plans to stop at various ports in Algeria. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Government Orders Expansion of Troops Stationed in Morocco to Wartime Strength</h3>
<p>French Navy to Conduct Maneuvers off the Coast of Africa; German Troop Presence in Morocco Violates Treaties</p>
<p>[Paris] The French government today ordered the expansion of troops stationed in Morocco to wartime strength to prevent emergencies. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Ministry of the Navy has just issued a public statement saying that the Atlantic and Mediterranean French naval fleets will conduct their customary winter exercises in mid-January each year. These exercises will be held along the Mediterranean coast of French Africa and the west coast of Africa. Therefore, warships are frequently moving in and out of French ports, but this is an annual event and should not be considered unusual. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the matter of German activities in Spanish Morocco, the French government made representations to the Spanish Nationalist authorities yesterday. According to responsible sources, the French government's representations are based on the treaty between France and Spain of October 3, 1904, the treaty between France and Morocco of 1912, and the agreement between France and Spain of 1912, declaring that the stationing of German troops in Spanish Morocco violates the above treaties. The 1904 Franco-Spanish treaty stipulates that in the event of military action, the French and Spanish governments should notify each other and that neither country should appeal to foreign governments. The 1912 Franco-Moroccan treaty stipulates that Morocco is a French protectorate, but allows a part of Moroccan territory to be designated as a Spanish sphere of influence. As for the 1912 Franco-Spanish agreement, one section states as follows: "The Spanish government guarantees that it will not transfer or relinquish all or part of the Spanish sphere of influence in Morocco, even temporarily." Responsible sources said that the various facts that have given rise to the French representations clearly violate the aforementioned treaties. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] "L'Intransigeant" recently published a dispatch from Rabat, French Morocco, stating that the German government intends to establish three German naval bases in Spanish Morocco: (1) Ifni, where a submarine base will be established, protected by 30,000 soldiers; (2) White Beach, on the coast of Spanish Río de Oro, which will serve as a seaplane base; and (3) Villa Cisneros, which will also be assigned to Germany by the Spanish Nationalist authorities. The report also said that Germany is conducting extensive propaganda among the tribes in southern French Morocco, inciting them to revolt against France. In addition, since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, France has closed its northern Moroccan border, and the abandoned commercial markets have been taken over by the German commercial delegation in Spanish Morocco and monopolized by Germany. The report also stated that a Fascist rifle association with anti-French tendencies has been established in the Tetouan area of Spanish Morocco. Furthermore, German Zeppelins often fly low over Spanish Morocco, and several German warships frequently patrol the neutral port of Tangier, where they unload military supplies. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Moroccan Question Becomes Serious Again; British and French Newspapers Express Unease</h3>
<p>[London] Regarding the entry of German troops into Spanish Morocco, North Africa, the newspapers have expressed unease. The Times correspondent in Paris stated: "According to extraordinarily reliable sources, a large number of German troops are about to arrive there, roughly on Sunday. Although the French government is unlikely to take drastic action to restore the status quo, maintaining the integrity of the territory is in France's vital interests, and the French government will naturally respond accordingly." The diplomatic correspondent of the Manchester Guardian stated: "It is generally believed that even if the Spanish government forces win, they will not be able or willing to restore Morocco. The Moroccan question, which affected the European situation before the European War, has reappeared in another form. British and French figures have long been aware of German activities in Spanish Morocco, but thought they would not quickly lead to a serious situation. Whether this issue will deteriorate further depends on the outcome of the Spanish Civil War and Germany's attitude." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The newspapers have commented on the stationing of German troops in Spanish Morocco, North Africa, saying that "the Agadir Crisis of 1911 has been revisited today." (Note: Agadir is a Moroccan port. In 1911, Germany sent the gunboat "Panther" there to protect German interests, causing a great shock in France and endangering European peace.) An article published by the famous reporter Bertin of the Paris Echo adequately expresses the general sentiment, stating: "The German gunboat's voyage to the port of Agadir has not been forgotten. Now Germany is replaying the old drama in another way. If it gains a foothold in North Africa, it will be very satisfied with its prospects. The minerals of the Triff region are insignificant in the eyes of the Germans. What they hope for is to win over the local tribes and oppress French Morocco and Algeria, and to redistribute the colonies as requested by the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Schacht. The French government made a big mistake in July last year, when the Spanish Civil War broke out, by not demonstrating its strength or clearly declaring its intention to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean situation. Now the French Atlantic fleet has sailed to Spanish waters to conduct exercises, and the Minister of State and Minister of National Defense, Daladier, will also visit French Morocco to inspect the defenses. These steps are a warning. If this is not enough, then the British and French should blockade Spain and its territories by land and sea. If not, the communications of the British and French in the Mediterranean will be threatened, and when the European situation changes, they will not be able to cope with it." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Soldiers Arrive in Spain</h3>
<p>Incessantly</p>
<p>Gibraltar: According to travelers who recently arrived here from the port of Cádiz, groups of uniformed German and Italian soldiers are disembarking at the port almost daily. Their ships do not display ship names and do not fly national flags. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: It is reported that another 3,500 Italian troops landed in Cádiz, Spain, today and have taken trains to Seville. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian reports that as thousands of Italian volunteer soldiers are landing in Cádiz, southern Spain, a commercial air route has been opened between Rome and Cádiz, with three round trips per week, with stops at Mallorca in the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean and Melilla in Spanish Morocco, North Africa. Since its opening, the planes departing from Rome have been filled with Italian industrialists and experts from military and political circles traveling to Spain. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Trotsky Arrives in Mexico</h3>
<p>Tampico, Mexico: Leon Trotsky, the head of the anti-Stalinist faction of the Soviet Communist Party, who was granted permission by the Mexican authorities to move from Sweden to Mexico, arrived here at 8:15 this morning. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Secretary for Trade Departs for the United States</h3>
<p>Official Confirmation Still Pending</p>
<p>[Washington] The news that the British Secretary for Trade, Runciman, has sailed from Glasgow to the United States has attracted significant attention here today, but officials cannot confirm Runciman's arrival. Runciman's visit may be related to the conclusion of a trade agreement between Britain and the United States. It is reported that the preliminary talks on the agreement have been satisfactory, although the two sides have not yet reached a final stage. However, U.S. Secretary of State Hull will return to the United States from Buenos Aires on the 14th of this month, which may lead to a satisfactory outcome. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Announces Construction of Two Battleships</h3>
<p>Each of 35,000 Tons, Costing $100 Million</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's proposed budget for 1938, submitted to Congress today, has a military expenditure that breaks all previous peacetime records. The budget stipulates $587,302,600 for the Navy Department, $399,460,400 for the Army Department, and $34,828,200 for the Army Department's non-military expenses. River and harbor fees total $143,322,101. In total, defense expenditures will exceed $1,000,000,000. The largest expenditures are for recruiting new troops, adding aircraft, and building warships. In the previous budget, the Navy Department's expenses were $391,424,149, and the Army Department's expenses were $373,014,977. The Navy Department's new expenses will be used to add two battleships, as announced by President Roosevelt, increase naval personnel, continue construction of two aircraft carriers, one heavy cruiser, three light cruisers, twenty destroyers, four submarines, and two gunboats. The ships currently under construction include twelve destroyers, six submarines, and two super battleships. As for the new warships, President Roosevelt stated today that they are only intended to replace the old battleships Arkansas and Texas. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt told reporters that the United States currently has three battleships, the Arkansas (26,000 tons), the New York, and the Texas (both 27,000 tons), which have been in service for more than 26 years. The construction of two new 35,000-ton battleships is underway to replace them, with an estimated cost of approximately $50 million per ship. He also said that at last year's London Naval Conference, the United States proposed to keep these obsolete warships for several more years before scrapping them, but this proposal was not accepted by the Naval Conference. On the contrary, various countries have recently built new battleships, such as Britain building two, France three, Italy two, and Germany three. The United States should not lag behind. The designs for the new battleships have already been drawn, but it is not yet known whether the caliber of their guns will be 14 inches or 16 inches. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>[New York] American bankers are impressed with President Roosevelt's message to Congress regarding the budget, but are doubtful about achieving a true balance of the budget within two years. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Neutrality Legislation Signed into Effect</h3>
<p>Implementing a Ban on Arms Shipments to Spain</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt today signed the amended Neutrality Act, and the ban on shipping arms and ammunition to Spain is now in effect. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt approved the ban on arms exports, the authorities immediately stopped the continued shipment of arms, ammunition, and other military supplies to Spain. Licenses for the export of $4.5 million worth of arms have been revoked by the Arms Management Office, and licenses that have been issued but not yet used have also been canceled. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Extreme Cold in the United States</h3>
<p>Chicago: A cold wave struck the Midwest of the United States today, and heavy snow fell in the Mississippi Valley. This cold wave is now moving southward toward Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. Four people have died in Texas. The weather bureau in Dallas predicts that the temperature will drop to 10 degrees tomorrow, which will be rare in many years. The temperature at Teal Lake is currently 41 degrees below zero, and Fargo is 10 degrees below zero. Snow has fallen along the California coast, which is also unprecedented in many years. The temperature in San Francisco is currently 30 degrees, and Redding is 16 degrees below zero, breaking a 20-year record. A blizzard occurred in Las Vegas, and a transcontinental bus and 15 cars were stranded in the George Mountain Pass, and may be buried by snow. The temperature in Tonopah is 11 degrees below zero. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[New York] Severe winds and heavy snow have occurred in the Midwest and Western states of the United States, resulting in the deaths of eleven people and material losses of millions of dollars, a major disaster unprecedented in 50 years. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Italian Budget</h3>
<p>[Rome] The government has decided on the budget for 1937-38 today, estimating a shortfall of approximately 3,172,000,000 lire. (The current year's budget is estimated to have a surplus of 20,442,000 lire.) Revenue is estimated at 20,596,000,000 lire, and expenditures at 23,769,000,000 lire. Expenditures for education, public works, and the army, navy, and air force have all increased, with the largest increase for the colonial department, probably due to the need to carry out public works in Abyssinia. The 1936-37 budget was balanced largely by eliminating the usual shortfall of the state-owned railways. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>British Embassy in Madrid Bombed; Britain Protests to the Rebels</h3>
<p>Rebels Continue to Make Progress in Attacking the Capital; Women in Barcelona Demand Bread</p>
<p>[London] Spanish Nationalist aircraft flew to Madrid yesterday morning and bombed the city. A bomb hit the British Consulate. The government has lodged a protest with the Nationalist authorities over this incident. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Several Nationalist aircraft bombed the British Embassy today, dropping four incendiary bombs that hit the roof of the building. The Army Attaché, Captain Lance, and Mrs. Mallory, a British national, were injured. Another incendiary bomb hit the residence of the British acting consul, Mr. Millan, and his wife escaped unharmed. Trees in front of the American Embassy were also uprooted by the bombs. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After the British Embassy staff moved to Valencia, the embassy building was only used to store food.

It is reported that several incendiary bombs landed in the so-called neutral zone. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Nationalist aircraft flew to the capital twice this morning, at 4:00 AM and 6:00 AM, and bombed the city intensely. Last night, many residents spent the night in the streets for fear of Nationalist aircraft attacking at night, while others fled to the suburbs and hid in the fields. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Avila: The city of Aravaca, northwest of Madrid, is strategically important and not easy to conquer. The Nationalist forces launched a major offensive half a month ago, but failed. In the past three days, they have been constantly bombarding it with artillery in preparation for another offensive. Yesterday, they launched two fierce attacks. Although the government forces resisted vigorously, the city fell at noon. As a result, the Nationalist forces can control the entire area along the Manzanares River west of the capital, as well as the towns and villages north of the capital, and threaten the main road to Burgos. All the residents of the northern suburbs were shocked, and refugees gathered in the village of Fuencarral, which is also being approached by the troops commanded by General Mola, the Nationalist commander in the north. In addition, the Nationalist forces now have unobstructed access to the transportation line between the Casa de Campo park, the university district, and the Puerta de Hierro on the western outskirts of Madrid. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Perpignan: According to news received here, a riot occurred in Barcelona today as women carrying infants stormed the city. These women marched from empty bread shops to the Catalan Autonomous Region Food Committee office, shouting slogans demanding bread. The demonstrators then sent representatives to demand that the authorities stop the infighting and provide bread. Fearing that the riot would escalate and lead to looting, the authorities told the rioters that food was already being transported to various places and that bread coupons would be issued next week.

<h3>Germany Confiscates Two Spanish Ships</h3>
<p>Spanish Government Asks Britain to Investigate; Rebels Repeatedly Detain Foreign Ships</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany has confiscated the Spanish ships Aragón and Mata Chica, in retaliation for the Spanish government's detention of cargo and passengers on the German ship Palos. Germany now intends to sell the two ships, and the proceeds may be given to the Nationalist forces to compensate for the detained cargo on the Palos and to console the families of the detained passengers. According to official statements, the sailors of the two ships will be returned to the Spanish government, probably sent to ports under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government, and then transferred to Spanish ships. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish Ambassador to Britain, Yanguas, has informed the Foreign Office that the Spanish government is prepared to submit the issue of the nature of the cargo detained on the German freighter Palos to the Non-Intervention Committee for investigation to determine whether it is indeed military supplies. If the Committee determines that it is not military supplies, then the Spanish government will return the detained cargo to Germany. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses German and Italian Replies</h3>
<p>Continuing Diplomatic Negotiations</p>
<p>[London] The cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to discuss the serious situation caused by the Italian and German military aid to the Spanish Nationalist forces and the German troops' deep penetration into Spanish Morocco. It is reported that Britain and France may demand a promise from Germany to respect the territorial integrity of Spanish Morocco. The cabinet also discussed the replies from Italy and Germany regarding the Anglo-French proposal to prevent volunteers from going to Spain. According to a Foreign Office spokesman, Britain believes that the plan to stop volunteers from going to Spain should be discussed first. Although Germany has requested that this issue be submitted to the Non-Intervention Committee for handling, Britain still advocates seeking a solution through direct diplomatic channels. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Prime Minister Baldwin convened a meeting of cabinet members currently in London this afternoon to discuss the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain. They studied the situation regarding the prohibition of volunteers after the replies from Germany and Italy were received. They believe that the replies from the two countries did not close the door to negotiations; on the contrary, they have already provided a basis for concrete proposals. However, according to informed sources, the replies from Germany and Italy did not directly address the issues raised by Britain and France. Therefore, the general public is now hoping that the British and French governments will reach an agreement and immediately begin diplomatic action to continue direct negotiations with the governments of the countries concerned, so that all these countries can understand the need to immediately establish an agreement regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers, and no longer delay.

<h3>French-Turkish Dispute</h3>
<p>Turkey Proposes a Solution</p>
<p>Istanbul: Turkish President Kemal, after going to Konya in southern Anatolia to discuss the French-Turkish dispute with senior officials, will return here tonight. The dispute between the two countries arose because France allowed Syria to become independent. Turkey is deeply concerned that after Syria's independence, the status of the Turkish minority in Alexandretta and Antioch will be affected, hence the disagreement. The tense situation between the two countries has now eased, as the two countries have resumed negotiations, and France's proposal to postpone the League of Nations Council meeting scheduled for January 18 has also been helpful. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Turkish President Kemal today demanded that the Alexandretta region be excluded from the territory of independent Syria. As relations between France and Turkey have become strained, the Turkish Ambassador to France visited Foreign Minister Viénot today, prompting the latter to declare that France intends to resolve the case peacefully. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital: When French Deputy Foreign Minister Viénot held talks with Turkish Ambassador to France Suad on the 7th of this month regarding the issue of the Turkish minority in Antioch and Alexandretta in Syria, he asked the ambassador to submit a solution as soon as possible. Informed sources have recently announced that this plan was delivered by the ambassador to the French government yesterday afternoon. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital: Foreign Minister Rüştü is scheduled to invite members of the National People's Party (the ruling party) of the parliament this afternoon to report on the talks between Viénot and Suad, and to inform the members of the content of the new note sent by the Turkish government to the French government yesterday.

<p>Antioch, Syria: The three neutral observers sent by the League of Nations Council to address the issue of the Turkish minority in this city and Alexandretta, namely Norwegian diplomat Holstet, senior Dutch official Jarna, Swiss Colonel Staffel Wantville, and staff from the League of Nations Secretariat, have arrived here to conduct an inspection. Pro-Turkish radicals in this area held a strike this morning, and all shops opened by Turks were closed. More than a thousand Syrian students held a counter-demonstration in front of the residences of the observers, singing Syrian songs and holding Syrian flags, and the situation was very enthusiastic. The French authorities came forward to restore order, and the students immediately returned to school in formation. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Maritime Workers' Strike Nears Resolution</h3>
<p>More Than Eighty-Eight Thousand Auto Workers on Strike</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Negotiations on the Pacific Coast labor strike are progressing smoothly. Shipping Association President Prentis issued a statement today saying that the resolution of the strike is not far away. The negotiations in the past few days have shown that both labor and management can act in good faith and with a fair spirit, which proves that peace is just around the corner. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Detroit: The auto workers' strike has expanded again. Five thousand one hundred workers at Cadillac Motor Car Company joined the strike today. The Chevrolet Gear and Axle plant announced that eight thousand people would strike at 5:00 pm, and four thousand five hundred will act in unison at 1:00 am tomorrow. Five hundred people at the Michigan Gear and Axle plant also went on strike. According to the General Motors Company authorities, as of tomorrow, the number of striking workers will reach 88,000. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Detroit: Since the start of the U.S. auto industry strike, the number of striking workers has reached 76,000. There was a minor clash between police and strikers in Flint, Michigan today, and the situation is deteriorating. Police in the area are now stationed with tear gas. At the same time, some workers at several factories have passed an anti-strike resolution and have organized an anti-strike group. After the addition of five more factories to the strike list yesterday and the failure of negotiations to break the deadlock, there is little hope for an early resolution of the dispute.

<h3>Impact of Japanese Exchange Control</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Trade in early January is the first step of the year. Usually, there are 60 to 70 million yuan of exports per ten-day period, but this ten-day period only saw 15.9 million yuan. Imports were also only 28.3 million yuan, which is very little compared to the usual 70 to 80 million yuan per ten-day period. However, the trade volume in the first ten days of each month cannot be generalized. It is meaningless to compare it with the same period last year, and it is not possible to use this single ten-day period as a standard for predicting this year's trade. However, depending on the authorities' handling of the Ministry of Finance order strengthening exchange control, which came into effect on the 8th, the trade situation will inevitably be affected. Japan's trade from now on will inevitably be slightly different from what it was before, which is predictable. However, the overall trend will inevitably be the same as last year, continuing the trend of decreasing exports and increasing imports, without a doubt. (9th Allied Telegram)</p>

<h3>New Trends in North China Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The Authorities Decide to Start Negotiations to Abolish the East Hebei Problem, and Have Already Ordered Chen Zhongfu and Others to Conduct Informal Talks</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the New Year, the general situation in North China has been renewed with the changing seasons. The local area is peaceful, and people's sentiments remain the same. Although various institutions of friendly nations stationed in North China seem to be working tirelessly and progressing rapidly, most of their plans are still hidden and have not yet surfaced. In recent days, only two things are worthy of attention: one is that on the 8th of this month, the North China Garrison Army of Japan, with the 1st Regiment Mutaguchi and the 2nd Regiment Higashijima as the center, united with various special forces soldiers and held a New Year's military parade at Limingzhuang Airport in the suburbs of Tianjin and Fengtai Railway Station. Each site had about 3,000 participating infantry, cavalry, artillery, and chemical warfare troops, commanded by Mutaguchi and Kayashima. The commander of the Japanese army, Tashiro, was in Tianjin, so the brigade commander, Kawabe, went to Fengtai to serve as the reviewing officer. At the same time, foreign guests were also invited. All Japanese veterans, volunteer corps, youth groups, and national defense women's associations in Tianjin, Fengtai, and other places in the Pingjin area participated. This is an unprecedented event in previous years. Whether it is a demonstration or a display of military force is unknown. The second is the expansion of the puppet organization in East Hebei into a puppet anti-communist government. After the resolution of the Shaanxi Incident, the only work of the Kwantung and North China armies of Japan has been focused on this. Within the New Year, Staff Officer Zenda of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, acting on Tashiro's orders, went to Tongzhou to visit traitor Yin Rugeng for negotiations. On the 5th of this month, Chief of Staff Hashimoto of the North China Garrison Army and Second Section Chief Wachi went to Ping to attend Song Zheyuan's New Year's banquet and also made a trip to Tongzhou. The head of the Special Service Agency in Ping, Matsui Takuro, accompanied them. On the same day, there were consultations with that side. On the 6th, the military attachés of Japan stationed in Jinan, Ishino, and Qingdao, Tanigaki, were summoned to Tianjin. A meeting was held at the Japanese Army Headquarters in Haiguang Temple, chaired by Tashiro, to study the affairs of supporting the expansion of the puppet organization in East Hebei and decided to take consistent action with the Kwantung Army Headquarters. Recently, anti-communist and anti-communist leaflets signed by certain groups have been found in Tianjin, and the wording is very激烈激烈, which is a response from certain parties supporting various puppet organizations and the puppet government of East Hebei, vainly hoping to realize their plans.</p>
<p>Last year, the Hebei-Chahar authorities suffered a heavy impact in terms of diplomacy, economy, taxation, and administration due to the failure to abolish the puppet organization in East Hebei. In the first half of last year, when Xiao Zhenying had not left office, he tried hard to negotiate the abolition of the puppet organization. After Xiao left, this issue was put aside. This year, the situation in North China is peaceful, and the authorities feel that the government's strength is sufficient to be a backing, so they are determined to raise the old matter again and demand the abolition of the puppet government in East Hebei. On the 4th of this month, Chen Zhongfu came to Tianjin on Song Zheyuan's orders to wish Tashiro and Hashimoto a happy New Year and incidentally expressed this intention. That side naturally did not want to talk, but the authorities are determined to overcome all difficulties and discuss this matter. When Hashimoto and Wachi were in Ping a few days ago, the authorities also made slight expressions during the banquet. In the view of the authorities, both the Hebei and Chahar negotiations must be negotiated, but because of the meaning of it being easier to break alone, Hebei is given priority over Chahar. Chen Zhongfu and Chen Juesheng are ordered to make contact from both the front and the side, and it is planned to first consult with Matsui, the head of the Special Service Agency stationed in Ping, and then formally propose negotiations to the Japanese Army Headquarters after there are signs. The Chahar matter belongs to the scope of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and in the future it is planned to contact that side directly through the introduction of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin. In short, the authorities, in view of the impact of the existence of the puppet East Hebei in the past year and the description of a certain party's request for the clarification of political power, must abolish the puppet organization this year and then finish.

<h3>Hong Kong Government Sends Police to Demolish Houses in Kowloon City</h3>
<p>Britain Has Long Been Deeply Concerned About Operating Kowloon, and the Residents of Kowloon City Are Rising Up to Call for Help</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The sovereignty of Kowloon City has recently become a major diplomatic issue, which has attracted the attention of Chinese people. Kowloon is adjacent to the land of Bao'an County in Guangdong Province. Since Kowloon was ceded to Britain, the Hong Kong government has worked hard to operate it. Hong Kong is an isolated island, and only the coastal area is a gathering place for shops. Except for a few major roads, it is mountainous and can only be developed as a residential area, and it cannot fully develop industry and commerce. Kowloon is separated from Hong Kong by the sea, which can be crossed by a single reed. It is connected to the mainland of Guangdong Province. Nearby villages provide food and fresh water (Hong Kong lacks fresh water, and drinking water is supplied by reservoirs using rainwater for daily use). Therefore, after the British government ceded Kowloon, it jointly operated the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway with our country. At present, the terminal of the British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is in Kowloon. In recent years, huge factories and warehouses in Hong Kong have been mostly set up in Kowloon. The British regard Kowloon as nothing less than the lifeline of Hong Kong. Recently, the north-south traffic of the Yuehan Railway has been opened, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways are planned to be connected. When the connection is completed in the future, Kowloon will become the southern terminus of the Yuehan Railway, which is also the southern terminus of the north-south artery of our country. Its position is even more important than Hong Kong. The British, with their keen and far-sighted eyes, attach great importance to Kowloon, which is almost deeply concerned.</p>
<p>Although "Kowloon" and "Kowloon City" are in the same place, there are historical relations and sovereignty differences between them. When Kowloon was ceded in the Qing Dynasty, Qing officials, for the sake of national face, tried hard to fight for a small plot of land to build a castle, with officials stationed there, to show the country that there was still the good name of Kowloon's national territory. At that time, the British, having ceded Kowloon and almost all of it, were willing to return Kowloon City, which was only more than 20 miles away, to China. The establishment of Kowloon City was in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, about 80 years ago. There are more than 400 residents in the city, with 60 or 70 households, a primary school, and a classroom and a temple each. Most of the residents are middle- and upper-class families engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, and they do business in Hong Kong and Nanyang. Our country's rule over Kowloon City is recorded in the treaty signed between China and Britain in June 1898, and it has been safe and without difference. The British, seeing that Kowloon will become the terminus of land transportation in South China, and there is great potential for development, are thinking about annexing Kowloon City to complete their ideal plan, so they disregard the treaty and, on the pretext that Kowloon City is within the ceded area of Kowloon, say that the Chinese flag flying in Kowloon City is an obstacle to the Hong Kong government's public security and administrative power, and declare that the Chinese sovereignty of the city must be abolished. Then, in October of last year, they forcibly sent British police to demolish houses in Kowloon City. At that time, the residents of the city strongly opposed it and sent telegrams to the Guangdong-Guangxi Diplomatic Office asking them to protest to Britain. At that time, the Hong Kong government temporarily suspended the demolition project due to the diplomatic negotiations raised by our diplomatic authorities and the resistance of the residents.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at the end of last year (December 29, 1936), the South Yau Ma Tei Civil Affairs Office of British Hong Kong suddenly sent two British policemen and several workers to Kowloon City and forcibly demolished the house at No. 25. The owner, Yang Weixiong, bare-handed, was unable to stop it and had to lead his family of old and weak people away from their ancestral home in tears. The neighborhood was threatened by imminent disaster and immediately set up the Kowloon City Case Support Association. On the one hand, they immediately telegraphed the Guangdong-Guangxi Diplomatic Commissioner's Office to complain, and on the other hand, they sent representatives Yang Weixiong and Lu Zhang to Yue on December 30 to pay respects to the Diplomatic Commissioner Diao Zuqian and the Chairman of Guangdong Province, Huang Musong, asking them to immediately negotiate with the other party to maintain national territory and protect sovereignty. Diao promised to first ask the British Consul in Guangzhou to consult the Kowloon Civil Affairs Office and first stop demolishing civilian houses. The reason is based on the British Ambassador to China's reply, stating that there will be no more forced relocation of Kowloon City residents in the future. The sudden forced demolition is a clear violation of the agreement. One party also telegraphed the British Ambassador to China, urging them to respect our country's sovereignty over the administration of Kowloon City. The two representatives, Lu and Yang, then separately asked the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and overseas Chinese groups for unified support. The Guangdong Overseas Chinese Affairs Office sent two officials to Kowloon City to comfort the refugees. In addition to sending telegrams to support them in March, overseas Chinese groups convened a meeting on the 4th to discuss rescue measures. The Diplomatic Commissioner's Office will also send personnel to Kowloon City to investigate the truth of the demolished houses and collect materials for preparing for negotiations.</p>
<h3>Shuyang County Cracks Down on a Traitor Organization</h3>
<p>Many Reactionary Exhibits Were Seized, and More Than Twenty Traitors Were Arrested</p>
<p>Haizhou Correspondence: On the evening of the 1st of this month, while all sectors of Shuyang County were holding a lantern parade, the county government suddenly received a secret report that traitors were plotting to take advantage of the opportunity to riot. County Magistrate Qi Lunji quickly ordered the business group and militia team to strictly guard against it. At the same time, he sent Rong, the chief of the first district, and many police officers from the Public Security Bureau to search various places inside and outside the city. Soon, 3,000 talismans were found in the house of a farmer surnamed Ye outside the North Gate. The words "Sworn Brotherhood" were written on the talismans, and a red seal was affixed in the middle. The seal text was "Longevity King Electric" in four characters. A white cloth flag was also found, with a five-colored circle on it and the word "順" (obedience) written on it. In addition, many password strips and more than 2,000 yuan of paper money from the Bank of China were also found. The password was the two words "天意" (Heaven's Will). Chief Rong then captured Ye and took him to the county government along with the exhibits. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau successively arrested more than 20 traitors in various places. It is heard that several traitors have also been arrested in various districts in the surrounding countryside in recent days.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Commissioner's Office Holds Nine-County Conference</p>
<p>The Songjiang District Administrative Commissioner's Office convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 9th, bringing together the county magistrates, education bureau chiefs, and chamber of commerce chairmen of the nine counties under its jurisdiction.

Detailed resolutions and concrete measures were made on all items.</p>
<p>Please Extend the Student Fee Payment Period</p>
<p>Citizens Xu Shiqi, Jun Dai Lian Zhang, and others believe that the start of the second semester of the 25th academic year of famous schools is at the time of the Lunar New Year. According to the regulations, students can only obtain class cards by paying fees at the prescribed rate; otherwise, they will not be allowed to attend classes. My country's production is backward and people's livelihood is poor. The Lunar New Year is the general end of all income and expenditure. The parents of poor children are trying to put together a collection to settle their debts so that they can make a spring turnaround. How can they have the surplus power to pay for their children's education? If they are not flexible, they will miss the opportunity for their children to study. What can the parents bear? Some parents of students are rich, but poor people are still in the majority, and many of them are suffering personally. They jointly presented a petition to the Provincial Education Department asking for flexibility so that the schools can collect fees in one month so that the schools' finances will not be hindered too much and poor parents will have the opportunity for economic turnaround and will not be put in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Severe Weather Brings Auspicious Snow</p>
<p>The weather in this county has been warm in recent days. On the morning of the 8th, the humidity dropped sharply, and the weather was severe. It snowed at around 10:00 a.m., and the roofs were white in an instant, turning into a crystal world.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>The Gun Used by the Bandit Was Borrowed from the Police Station</p>
<p>The Yiyong Team of Anting Town, District 4, captured bandit Hong Di, a Wenzhou native, on the evening of the 4th. He had worked in the County Public Security Bureau and the Waigang Public Security Branch. A pistol was found on him. According to him, it was borrowed from the patrol leader of the Third Branch of the Lou Tang Public Security Bureau in District 5 for the purpose of killing a Yan. The tunnel immediately sent a telegram to inquire about Niu Patrol Xiao of the Lou Tang Branch. Niu was furious when he heard the news and strictly interrogated Zou Baotian, the patrol leader in charge of the pistol. Zou claimed that it was stolen and immediately sent household registration police officer Wu Xun San to go to An to take the gun offender to Lou. The Yiyong team refused and reported it to the County Government, which ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to the case for interrogation.</p>
<p>Two Murder Cases in Nanxiang</p>
<p>Wang Azhao, who sells used goods in Maojiawan, East Market, Nanxiang, and Wang Anfu, who works in the same industry in the same place, severely injured each other on December 26 two years ago. The town's Public Security Bureau has already imposed a fine on the matter. However, on the 5th of this month, Wang died of severe injuries and vomiting blood. Wang's wife, Shen, reported the matter to the bureau, and the bureau detained and sent the case to the county. Wang's body is now exposed next to the Ziliu Well awaiting examination. Also, near Nanyuan in the West Market, a corpse was found on the morning of the 8th. It was learned that the deceased was Zhu Hongwu, 40 years old, who committed suicide by hanging himself due to unemployment and the pressure of livelihood. He had no relatives in the town, and the County Government had already sent officials to verify the facts and ordered the local officials to bury the body.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Additional Tax Collection Offices in Each District</p>
<p>This county had a bumper harvest last fall, and the tax collection was relatively prosperous. In order to facilitate tax payment for small households in each township, the county government will set up additional tax collection offices in each district starting on the 8th. There will be offices set up in Lujia浜 in District 3, Qidun Town in District 4, Yangxiang泾 Town in District 5, Jiaozhi Town in District 6, and Bacheng Town in District 8. The directors of each branch office have already left with the staff on the 9th to provide services.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Merchants Oppose Tax Increases</p>
<p>The four trades of tobacco, alcohol, etc. here have protested against the tax bureau's increase in license tax and have appointed representatives to petition the party and government organs. Before the matter is resolved, they will uniformly postpone the payment of taxes. The tax amount has always been contracted by merchants according to the amount of the contract. As a result, the tax amount has increased endlessly. The direct victims are small merchants. Due to sluggish business and poor strength, they have closed down one after another. Now that the tax is jointly handled by the Business Tax Bureau, the stall levels have been increased when the tax is levied this season due to the amount relationship. The merchants are indeed unable to compare with the business of the past and are not deliberately resisting taxes. Therefore, the four trades were summoned and Peng Songjiu and Liu Weizu were appointed as representatives to petition the party and government authorities to unanimously oppose the tax increase.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Construction of Village Roads by County Government</p>
<p>The Wu County government has decided that this year, it will use labor service to construct a large number of village roads, including He Du to Hengjing, Mu Du to Xukou, Huguan to Tong'an Bridge, Huangdai to Likou, Xiangcheng to Wutang, Xiangcheng to Huxiang, and the Zhou Deng Line and Wushan Line, so that they can connect with the already established Su Kun, Su Chang, and other highways.</p>
<p>Intensified General Re-Investigation of Drug Offenders</p>
<p>The heads of districts and towns in Wu County, together with the relevant public security organs, have been dispatched since the 6th of this month to conduct a general re-investigation of opium and drug offenders. Over the past few days, the work has been intense. More than 100 opium and drug offenders have been arrested and sent to the county government to await verification and handling. Now, County Magistrate Deng, in order to actively eliminate opium and drug offenders, has specifically notified the Public Security Bureau to dispatch five staff members from each bureau to begin active investigation starting from the 10th, and to complete the general re-investigation work within this month.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Petition to Increase Silkworm Seed Prices</p>
<p>Since the provincial government implemented control over silkworm seeds in Jiangsu Province, seed prices have been set by the Silk Management Committee. The Wuxi Silkworm Seed Industry Association believes that recently, prices of all goods have increased, and the manufacturing cost of silkworm seeds has also increased accordingly. Yesterday, it was decided by the industry to submit a petition to the Department of Construction to increase silkworm seed prices in order to maintain business.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Strictly Pursues Old Taxes</p>
<p>The county's land tax arrears are very large. From the 16th to the 19th year of the Republic, the total amount of arrears in rice and other taxes was approximately 296,000 yuan. From the 20th to the 23rd year, the total amount of arrears was 680,000 yuan. Since the 24th year, the fiscal year has been implemented, stipulating that land tax be collected in two installments each year. The provincial government has repeatedly instructed the county government to strictly urge the collection of the above-mentioned old arrears. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Long began urging collection on December 1st of last year, limiting the completion to five months. The provincial government also sent Dong Chengqi, a member of the Old Tax Clearance Committee, to Wuxi to strictly supervise. Committee Member Dong also concurrently handles the old taxes of Changshu and Taicang counties. The new tax levy for the 25th year of this county is 1.2 million yuan. The first installment levy is 40%, totaling more than 480,000 yuan, of which more than 350,000 yuan has already been collected, which is a good result. The second installment levies 60% and is still being levied.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Meeting on Collecting Handicrafts</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province will collect handicrafts from all over the country and hold an exhibition in Zhenjiang in March. The Department of Construction has commissioned Wang Judong to convene the county magistrates and chairmen of the chambers of commerce of Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi, and Jing counties to discuss the specific items to be collected. It has been decided that the items to be collected by each county should be transported to the Department of Construction before February 15th.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Qianjiang Sends Police Escort</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Zhakou Qianjiang Dahua Sanlian Steamship Bureau believes that with the convenience of highways and railways in recent years, shipping has declined sharply. However, people with decent financial means mostly switch to steamboats. Some try to get half-price tickets or borrow the names of military and police agencies to avoid paying fares, leading to repeated disputes. Shipping merchants are suffering greatly. Now the company has recommended directors to the provincial public security bureau, requesting that six volunteer police officers and one special task force leader be assigned to carefully navigate and take care of water security. The bureau has approved this and ordered the 3rd Military Police Inspection Team to dispatch personnel to start work on a specific date.</p>

<h3>Iron City Cup Basketball Closing Ceremony and South China Men's A Championship</h3>
<p>South China Defeats Fudan 35-19, South China Leads from Beginning to End</p>
<p>The last act of the Iron City Cup Basketball Tournament was successfully completed yesterday, and the order was very good. South China defeated Fudan to win the Group A championship. Southeast won the first game but lost the second; the Municipal Sports Team A defeated the Faculty of Law to win a championship; Xinmin defeated Chizhong to win the Group B4 championship. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>South China Defeats Fudan</p>
<p>Yin, Han, and Xu of South China had not played for a long time. Yesterday was the first time they played with the official lineup. Yin Guiren had just recovered from a new illness and was slightly weaker, but still scored a lot of points. Kuang Yaoya and Cai Yanxiong worked particularly hard and performed very well. Wang Nanzhen and Han Zhenyuan each did their best, but the whole team still made many mistakes, due to not having played for a long time. Moreover, yesterday's style of play was not as good as the previous day's game against the Xin team, partly because South China's defense was too strict, making it impossible to advance, and partly because they were too cautious, affected by psychology, and missed many throws. Zhou Dayun was not able to perform as desired. The two teams were too stable, so the atmosphere on the court was serious, tense, and not active. The details of the game are as follows:</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>South China sent Yin, Han, Kuang, Cai, and Wang; Fudan sent Chuan, Zhou, Qiu, Weng, and Chen. The battle began. For two minutes, neither team scored. Chuan Xiangrui fouled, Wang Nanzhen missed the free throw. Han Zhenyuan rushed into the encirclement and opened the scoring. Zhou Dayun fouled, Cai Binxiong added one point. Han Zhenyuan scored twice, and South China took the lead with 5-0. Fudan called a timeout. Weng Ren'an fouled, Yin Guiren missed both free throws. Fudan still relied on Zhou Dayun's long throw to score two points for the first time, making it 7-6. This was the closest score of the evening. Zhou Dayun and Chen Zongqi fouled in succession. Zhou Dayun was too cautious and missed again. Yin Guiren scored from a long shot, and then Weng Ren'an and Qiu Guangxie successively scored, making it 7-6. This was the closest score of the evening. Zhou Dayun and Chen Zongqi fouled in succession. Yin Guiren missed repeatedly. Then Yin went straight in and scored. Nan Zhen followed suit and succeeded again. Han Zhenyuan was unwilling to be left behind and added another point, making it 14-6, South China leading by eight points. The first half ended with South China leading 18-8.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>The second half began, and Chen Zongqi rushed in from behind and succeeded. Han Zhenyuan and Kuang Yaoya fouled one after another. Fudan missed completely, being too cautious, which was a pity. Kuang Yaoya scored three points with consecutive throws and penalties. Yin Guiren took time out from his busy schedule to add two points. South China then took the lead by as many as twelve points, with a score of 25-11. After a while, South China made it 31-17. In the last minute, the situation was set. Kuang Yaoya scored two goals in three minutes, and South China won the Group A championship with a score of 35-19.</p>
<h3>West Blue Basketball Ended Unhappily Last Night</h3>

Therefore, the first half was not finished, and the game ended unhappily. The results of each game are as follows. There are no games today, Sunday.</p>

<h3>China Blue Basketball Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bank Group: National Goods Narrowly Defeats Shanghai</p>
<p>The First China Blue Basketball League is divided into four groups: commercial banks, banks, schools, and women. The commercial bank and bank groups opened yesterday. In the future, they will play every Wednesday and Saturday. The school group will start on the 13th of next month, playing every Saturday. There were five games yesterday, especially the game between National Goods and Shanghai in the bank group, which was more intense. The two teams had their own strengths in attack and defense. As a result, National Goods, with the help of Dai Linjing and Jia Youliang, and because the former Niu team led 18-10, although they were three points behind in the second half, finally won 28-23. Dai Linjing scored twelve points alone, making a great contribution. However, Zhang Hua, a dark horse in this competition, defeated the defending champion Xiangtai Jia Yan, which can be said to be not easy. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Referee Association Defeated Mei Zuishi (Commercial 4) 57-35 (First Half 24-9)</p>

<h3>The Ten-Point Ping-Pong Scoring Method Has Also Been Studied and Adopted by Japan</h3>
<p>The ten-point ping-pong scoring method created by Wang Yi of the Chinese Ping-Pong Research Association, after being approved by the All-China Ping-Pong Promotion Association and unanimously adopted by ping-pong organizations in various places, the Japanese ping-pong community also believes that this method is very reasonable. They immediately studied and repeatedly tried it. Now the highest ping-pong authority in Japan, the Japan Table Tennis Association, has officially decided to announce its adoption. It is reported that ping-pong authorities from all over the country, including Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo, participated in the meeting and discussed and studied it very carefully. As a result, they all considered it satisfactory and regarded it as a reasonable manifestation of progress. Also, the variable time system proposed by Mr. Wang before the National Games two years ago has not yet been officially adopted in our country, but it has been included in the new Japanese rules, stipulating that the maximum time for each game is one hour. If it is not possible to finish within this time, the winner is the one with more points at the time of suspension. Recently, Mr. Meng Tieke, the secretary of the World Ping-Pong Association, also published his opinion in the British Ping-Pong Daily, believing that ping-pong games seem to need to have a time limit, so as not to be extended indefinitely, hindering other games and preventing them from being completed on time.</p>

The completion ceremony was held at 3:00 PM yesterday, and more than 500 Chinese and foreign guests, alumni, and students attended. Principal Shen took the chair and reported on the process of raising funds to build the science hall, and put forward the points of active construction and collective cooperation to encourage each other. Then, Mr. Wang Zhiren, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, gave a speech, elaborating on the importance of science and its relationship with morality in great detail.

After Mrs. John and Mrs. Shen Tilan distributed prizes, Ms. Zheng Lihua unveiled the curtain and opened the door with a golden key amidst cheers and firecrackers, and the whole body entered the hall to visit. The hall was designed by German engineer M•HR•Durst, and built by the Jiutai Jinji Construction Factory. It is a three-story steel-concrete, state-of-the-art building, magnificent and grand. The first and second floors are classrooms and laboratories, and the third floor is the physics, biology, and chemistry laboratories and the Geng Huang Hall. The construction cost of the Geng Huang Hall was donated by Mr. Shen Genhuang, the respected father of Principal Shen, so it was named in his memory. The hall also has two large lecture halls, one donated by Mr. Li Fuxun and one donated by Jiutai Jinji Construction Factory. All the equipment is extremely modern, and it can be called the best among general private secondary schools in China.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The Future of Rice Prices: Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall; Grain Merchants Smile and Refuse to Sell Easily; the Poor Struggle to Make Ends Meet and Suffer from Expensive Rice</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, more than 30 rice boats from various Hu Nan, Pujiang, and other gangs arrived in Shanghai, with about 6,120 shi of cargo. Among them, there were more than 20 boats of thin rice. Rice sales in Pujiang have been sluggish in recent days, and the stock has gradually increased. The sales floors in this street are also showing a wait-and-see attitude. The other gangs are also waiting and not advancing because the Tianjin market is declining step by step. Only the Qingdao gang handled 700-800 bags of thin rice, resulting in the seller's goods being sold out in a few days, and the market situation is even more deserted. As a result, the market prices of thin rice were reduced by a few cents to a dime, thick japonica rice was cut by half a dime, and Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan and other varieties were not traded. The market is still weak. According to this, the rice stock in Pujiang is increasing day by day, and the sales of "baozi" (rice shipments) have become dull again and again, making it difficult to be optimistic. However, for a year, not only has the Shanghai rice market almost entirely relied on sales to the north, but also the amount of rice from Changzhou and Wuxi transported directly to the north and south of Guangdong without going through Shanghai is even greater than the amount shipped out of Shanghai. In the past month, Shanghai rice merchants have been buying rice from various places in western Zhejiang and transporting it continuously, mostly indica and pointed rice, so the price of coarse indica rice has also risen to about eight yuan. Guangdong is still worried about insufficient rice and is still requesting the exemption of import tariffs on foreign rice to seek relief. Although the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau to stabilize rice prices has been established, it has not yet seen any development. The price of thin coarse rice in Suzhou and Songjiang has reached about nine yuan through various means of transportation. This year, agricultural products are all expensive, and the villagers have the ability to wait for the selling price before selling. Therefore, if the price of rice in Shanghai is weak, it may not be difficult for mainland merchants to temporarily store the goods arriving in Shanghai in the mainland to wait for opportunities. Since the supply is scarce, they will not easily sell it until a considerable price is reached. Therefore, observing the changes in the market outlook, it is feared that it will become a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. In addition, none of the Shanghai grain merchants have failed to increase their prices in the past year. This is due to the implementation of income tax in January of this year, and many of them have made a settlement at the end of the lunar year. Therefore, all kinds of grain firms have been smiling and have made huge profits. In particular, the disclosed surplus of Zhu's firm has reached 200,000-300,000 yuan, and the others can be known. Since the merchants have all benefited, they will also be powerful in secretly maintaining grain prices. As a result, it is not yet known whether the adjustment of people's food can be realized. The price of rice is as expensive as pearls, and firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, which is already imminent and people are sighing. As for the rice market in Zhabei yesterday, 30-40 goods arrived from various places, and the sales of various goods in the market were stable. The price of white japonica rice fell by 20-30 cents, the price of thin rice fell by a little more than a dime, the price of early rice also fell by a dime, and the price of Yangbu Du Jian fell by nearly a dime. The price of Bian Yuan fell by about a dime, and the prices of other rice varieties also fell by a few cents to nearly a dime.</p>
<p>(Passenger Indica) Yesterday, the passenger indica market was booming in terms of both arrivals and sales. The arrivals loaded from Hankou, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places were about 10,000 bags per day. The sales were very brisk due to the strong demand in Guangdong. The Shantou, Henan, Beiyang and other gangs in this street all had dealings. The Guangdong gang was even more greedy in purchasing coarse rice, purchasing 5,000 bags of Hankou coarse rice and 3,000-4,000 bags of Hunan and Jiangxi coarse rice. Because of the continued strong demand, the market price immediately jumped by a dime. Other milled rice and the like were only for the station because they were not in demand in Guangdong. Today's opening showed 1,600 bags of Hunan rice, 5,000 bags of Hankou coarse rice, 4,924 bags of Gan rice, 1,225 bags of Wen, Yong, and Shao rice, and 200 bags of Siamese rice.</p>
<p>Fluctuations in Flour and Wheat Prices are Unpredictable; Yesterday, they Fell Sharply Again with Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month suddenly showed a sharp decline, because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell sharply. Chicago fell by 50 cents in the near term and 70 cents in the far term. Canada fell by 45 cents. After the opening price, the goal of most of the off-market market was to shift to foreign countries. The rebound the day before was based on foreign wheat, so yesterday's fall in foreign wheat made people feel relaxed again. Moreover, the final settlement is not far away, and most of the guest business is suspended, so the outsiders are working hard to move and pursue the price very hard. The volatility of the market is for this reason. It is estimated that in half a day, each month fell by 456 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the transaction turned clear, and the market car hovered. January and February were better by one cent, while March and April were the same. In the future, the fluctuations of foreign wheat are uncertain, and the fluctuations will be many.</p>
<p>At the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market in each month showed a consistent loosening and decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat also fell by 45 cents to 70 cents. After the opening price, because the rise the day before was purely driven by foreign wheat, and now foreign wheat has fallen, the selling atmosphere is very strong, and the opening price fell by 678 cents. However, the real households are watching and the transaction is not smooth. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market was very flat, some of the long positions outside the industry returned, so the far-term fell by another 35 cents. After that, if the flour sales are lonely, the wheat market will be less colorful. At present, the wheat market is not smooth, and the whole market has only more than 2,000 bags of transactions, and the price is slightly smaller than the previous day by 34 cents. Financial</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Japanese Controlled Foreign Exchange; Spot Yarn Returned to Stability; Spot Sales are Also Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>After the wild rise and fall of the yarn market the day before, the momentum has turned calm. In addition, after the official announcement of the Japanese Foreign Exchange Control Law, people's minds have become more stable. At the same time, spot yarn business has become increasingly dull, and the situation of 10-count coarse yarn is particularly weak. Yihuo Factory opened 20-count Wufu Shepherd and mostly sold it to the spot yarn market. Therefore, Qian Ruan has been soft in recent months. However, because the Dagu Sanpin Yarn market is still strong, the long position has not changed its intention. However, most of the industry has gradually increased its yarn stock, and the yarn factory spindles have been fully opened, and production can be increased, so the interest is slightly diminished.</p>
<p>The Factory Massively Sells in this Month</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, because the Japanese government announced the strengthened management of the exchange rate law, people's minds were calmed down. Moreover, the factory had a huge amount of sales this month, and the amount was very large, and the market pressure was particularly heavy, and it suddenly fell by two yuan. The far month was also tired. At the second disk, the Osaka Sanpin Yarn recently slightly rose by one and a half yuan, and the mid-term fell instead, and the market situation became more and more weak. At the same time, the spot price of 20-count Wufu fell by two yuan, and the customer sales were not smooth, and the situation was more frustrated. When the market closed, it was heard that the Osaka Sanpin's far-term rose by 3•4 yuan, the market price was revitalized, and it returned to a high flight. As a result, each month fell by 4•5 cents compared with the previous day's closing price. The market was very ordinary when it opened in the afternoon, and there were very few transactions. However, the long position slightly dragged in and increased the code, and the shape was firm, but the spot yarn price was loosened, and the price of 10-count yarn fell by 3•4 yuan. In fact, it was reported that Wang Taixing had 1,550 bags, Jifeng 900 bags, Minghua 1,950 bags, Guangfeng 850 bags, Chengji 850 bags, Juyu 750 bags, Renfeng 1,550 bags, Yongda 1,500 bags, Tonghe 700 bags, Yuda 1,800 bags, Daji 700 bags, and bought He Xing 1,300 bags, Hengyi 1,850 bags, Dafeng 1,100 bags, Mingde 1,400 bags, Fengtai 850 bags, Dachangcheng 850 bags, Changfeng 1,850 bags, Run Kang 2,700 bags, Hengchang 1,150 bags, and Xincheng 1,050 bags. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>20-Count Wufu Fell by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales are still flat. It is reported that the statistics of all gangs buying a total of 697 bags throughout the day, and the selling price fell by 2 yuan. Among them, the 20-count Wufu yarn fell by about 5 yuan, and the coarse yarn market price was very weak. The buying amount of each gang is as follows.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Has Very Little Progress</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and there is absolutely no excitement. In addition, the overseas market is also in a stalemate. As for the spot cotton market, it feels very dull. The factory also purchases less, and the cotton stock has not decreased, so the market is stable.</p>
<p>The Spot Cotton Market Recovers Slightly</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, because US cotton fell back, Indian cotton rose and fell, and after the Toyo cotton market fell back, people's minds turned to stability.

<h3>Tax Administration Announces Sharp Increase in Unified Tax Revenue for the Second Half of Last Year</h3>
<p>Smuggling Affects Stamp Tax Shortfall; Unified Mine Taxes Show Significant Progress</p>
<p>The collection of unified, mining, stamp, and tobacco taxes under the jurisdiction of the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance has reached six months since the beginning of the 25th year of the Republic (from July to December 25th). The various tax revenues collected are currently being reviewed by the Administration, and preliminary statistics have been compiled. In total, over 83,671,100 national currency dollars were collected in the past six months, an increase of over 16,700,000 dollars compared to the same period last year. The Administration's tax revenue figures and comparisons with the same period last year are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Of the above items, only stamp tax had a significant shortfall. The reason is a large decrease in revenue from Hebei Province, possibly due to the impact of smuggling on commercial sales. Tobacco and alcohol taxes also had a slight shortfall. However, the surpluses in unified and mining taxes were significant. For unified taxes, cigarettes accounted for the largest portion, followed by cotton yarn, cement, and smoked tobacco. Such significant progress in six months is unprecedented since the start of unified taxes.</p>

<h3>Over Seventy Organizations in the City Telegraph Yang and Yu to Urge Them to</h3>
<p>Awaken and Obey the Central Government; Do Not Cause Losses to the Nation and Locality</p>
<p>The National Society says that rumors have been circulating recently that Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi and Yu Xuezhong of Gansu are plotting to resist orders. Upon hearing the news, various organizations in the city were extremely shocked. The City Education Association, the Cultural Construction Association, the Boy Scout Council, the Cooperative Business Promotion Association, the Joint Association of Secondary Schools, and over 70 other cultural organizations in the city sent a telegram to Yang and Yu yesterday, urging them to awaken and obey the Central Government and not to cause losses to the nation and locality. The original telegram is as follows: "Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, Mr. Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, the Central Government has already appointed Mr. Sun Weiru, a subordinate of Mr. Yang Hucheng, as Chairman of Shaanxi Province, and Mr. Wang Shutang, a veteran of the Northeast, as Director of the Gansu Pacification Office after considering the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu. The defense areas of the various armies have also been properly redistributed, and the soldiers' pay has also been handled more appropriately than before. As for your crimes of destroying the law and discipline and disrupting the local area, the Central Government has only given you the punishment of dismissal with retention of position, and this punishment does not harm your high official positions and generous salaries in the slightest. It is clear that the Central Government is being overly tolerant, not holding you accountable for the past. Legal principles and human sentiments are both considered, and the people of the country are all convinced. However, many days have passed, and you have not shown any signs of obeying the orders, and rumors of your attempts to resist the orders are causing our associations to be extremely alarmed. We believe that the Northwestern provinces are regarded by the people of the country as a new foundation for the revitalization of China. Not only does the government attach special importance to the economic construction of Shaanxi and Gansu, but also the private banking industry has invested heavily. You are both high officials in the North, and you should solemnly obey the orders and quickly return to the legal track. How can you bear to cause further disturbances, to destroy the nation's plans, and to increase local losses? We are sending this telegram specifically to urge you to consider the suppression of the bandits on the border, which is awaiting eradication, and the remnants of the bandits in Shaanxi and Gansu, which still need to be wiped out. Awaken and obey the Central Government, immediately express your proper attitude, so as to redeem your previous mistakes and plan for future achievements."</p>
<h3>Letter from the City Party Headquarters to Party Members</h3>
<p>Report in Person Today to Fill Out Forms; Be Assigned to New Divisions</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters of this city, in order to reorganize the various divisions in the city, specially issued a letter to comrades yesterday, stating: "All comrades in the city are hereby informed that the district divisions are the basic organizations of our party, directly built by party members. The will and actions of party members are expressed through them. Whether the foundation of the party is solid depends on whether the district divisions are sound, and whether the district divisions have strength depends on the quality of their constituent party members. Therefore, considering the importance of the position of the district divisions, efforts should be made to ensure that their organization is strict and their operation is flexible. Considering the close relationship between the district divisions and party members, they should be guided according to the situation so that they all become excellent revolutionary elements. This is the responsibility that the district divisions should bear internally and cannot be ignored. Secondly, in terms of external affairs, the district divisions are the mechanism that links party members with the higher-level party headquarters. Only through the district divisions can the opinions of party members be directly gathered and contributed to the higher-level party headquarters. Only through the district divisions can the resolutions and orders of the higher-level party headquarters be transmitted and directly direct party members to implement them. Therefore, whether the will of party members and the will of the party are integrated into one, the district divisions bear full responsibility. Furthermore, the district divisions are closest to the people. The district divisions should lead the way in relieving the people's suffering, realizing the people's interests, publicizing the party's doctrines, and implementing revolutionary work, so as to gain their sympathy and cooperation. The association has reviewed the past district divisions in this city, which were loosely organized and slack in their work. The majority of them failed to shoulder the above-mentioned tasks. This time, there is a reorganization. According to the regulations, all district divisions under the headquarters must be reorganized, and all party members must re-register. The association hopes to achieve the following goals after the reorganization: (A) Through the re-delimitation of the areas of the district divisions, it is hoped that the distribution of the district divisions will be improved compared to before. (B) Through the handling of party members' registration and form-filling procedures, it is hoped that party members who do not work hard will be eliminated. (C) Re-elect the executive committee of the district divisions. It is hoped that more sound cadres will be produced, especially the election of appropriate duty commissioners. (D) Due to the reorganization of the district division organization, it is hoped that the spirit of party members will be uplifted and the perception of the outside world will be renewed. (E) Due to the uplifted spirit of party members, it is hoped that work can be actively promoted. Now the reorganization work has just begun. The association hopes that all comrades in the city will understand this meaning and must go to the original or nearby district party headquarters in person on the 9th or 10th of this month to complete the registration and form-filling procedures, wait to be assigned to the new district divisions, and actively work. If anyone dares to deliberately violate the order and fails to complete the registration and form-filling procedures within the deadline, they will be severely punished once they are found out in the future. All comrades in the city should pay attention to this. The Executive Committee of the Kuomintang Special Municipality of Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Cai Zengji, Manager of the Wharf Department of the China Merchants Bureau, Also Serves as Manager</h3>
<p>Shen Zhongyi Appointed Deputy Manager of the Bureau</p>
<p>Tan Boying, Deputy Manager of the state-run China Merchants Bureau and Manager of the Wharf Management Department, has requested to resign. It is reported that it has been approved by the Ministry of Communications, and Mr. Shen Shenyi has been appointed as Deputy Manager of the Bureau. Mr. Shen has previously served as Section Chief and Manager of the Hankou Bureau in the China Merchants Bureau. In recent years, he has also held important positions in the Sanbei Steamship Company. He has rich experience in the shipping industry and can be said to be a talented person for the Bureau. As for the position of Manager of the Wharf Management Department of the Bureau, it has been temporarily held by General Manager Cai Zengji by order of the Ministry. According to a statement issued by General Manager Cai yesterday, since the reorganization, the head office and its affiliated branch offices have been tidied up and have taken shape. However, although the wharf and cargo yard matters have been established as a Wharf Management Department responsible for tidying up, except for the public bidding of the wharf porters, which is organized by the head office, other tidying matters have not been actively carried out. After the resignation of Concurrent Manager Tan, the Ministry ordered that I concurrently serve as the post, which is to facilitate direct supervision and command, so as to thoroughly tidy up. It has been decided that after taking over, the wharf affairs will be fundamentally improved as much as possible, such as (1) Although the Bureau is a state-run agency, it belongs to the transportation public utilities. The principles of commercialization and convenience to customers first should be used for soliciting business and handling procedures. It is different from the handling procedures of ordinary administrative agencies. (2) Shipping companies have always had compensation methods for cargo damage. In the future, the Bureau will not only strive for swift action in handling damage procedures, but also try to absolutely protect the goods, so that customers are protected from losses and reduce damage incidents. (3) Stacking goods in various yards is one of the main tasks. If the stacking is not done properly, it will be uneconomical in terms of yard location and loading and unloading time, and it will also be inconvenient for customers to load and unload goods. In the future, it is necessary to plan in advance to make the stacking reasonable and reduce various losses. (4) Since the public bidding of the wharf porters has been handed over to contractors, there are occasional imperfections in the handling. In the future, strict orders should be given to rectify them, so that the contractors fulfill the contracting contracts and improve the efficiency of the porters, so as to avoid further delays in the Bureau's schedule. It is also necessary to prepare for the berthing of foreign ships and the loading and unloading of cargo without any delay. The bad habits of contractors deducting workers' wages and soliciting from customers must also be fundamentally eliminated. (5) The lives of the dockworkers are extremely difficult. Therefore, there are often all kinds of unnecessary disputes caused by being exploited and oppressed. The workers themselves suffer, and the Bureau's business is also affected. In addition to ordering the contractors of each search to treat the workers fairly according to the contracting contracts, the Bureau is also starting to study and organize employee welfare projects (such as setting up consumer cooperatives, clinics, bathrooms, toilets, etc., and plans to try them out at Jinliyuan Wharf first). The above are just a few examples. Other periods of this matter will also be considered for appropriate improvement. However, this is only passive, and the existing wharf affairs will be thoroughly tidied up. As for active tidying up, such as repairing wharves and cargo yards and adding new equipment to adapt to the needs of expanding business and commercial competition, the amount of money required is about tens of millions. I will also be responsible for planning this financial problem. In general, after taking over, all the various problems will be solved separately, so as to live up to the expectations of the Ministry of Communications. However, the matter is heavy and my thinking may not be perfect. I deeply hope that the gentlemen of the state and the Bureau's customers will give instructions on the Bureau's wharf reform matters at any time, so that they can be used as a model. As for my affairs, they are very busy. If the wharf tidying policy can be realized and all matters can be on track, then I will definitely ask the Ministry to appoint other suitable personnel to take over the post of Manager of the Concurrently held Wharf Management Department.</p>
<p>It is also reported that a person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau said that the contractor of the Nan Wharf (i.e., Jinliyuan Wharf) porter was replaced by the Bureau due to poor handling, weak ability, and slow work that delayed the schedule. Qiu Dinglai, the alternate bidder, was appointed to take over. Yesterday, because the original contractor delayed in handing over, the Bureau specially ordered the Wharf Management Department to supervise the handover by the 13th of this month. The original contractor still refused to comply with the order, so only forced execution was possible. Or, if the business suffers losses as a result, the original contractor should be held responsible for compensation.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Authorities Will Also Reduce Administration</h3>
<p>Only Cutting Subsidies Without Reducing Salaries</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that the discussion of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works' plan to reduce administration is still ongoing. Yesterday (the 8th), it was learned that the French Concession Municipal Authorities also intend to engage in reducing administration, but not as severely as the Public Concession, only intending to cut the special subsidies for senior personnel without reducing salaries. According to personnel from several departments of the Board of Directors, the French authorities are especially unwilling for the various staff to reduce their efficiency due to seeing their salaries about to be drastically cut, especially for the police administration, which has recently been engaged in encouraging officers to stay in their jobs with peace of mind and trying to facilitate various matters, so that later personnel can obtain superior materials. However, due to the financial expenses, it is necessary to ask the staff to accept certain cuts to make up for part of the short funds. The Economic Committee, which was appointed at the beginning of November last year, has now stated that the shortage of municipal expenses cannot be regarded as a thing of the past and must be prevented from increasing again. However, temporary plans cannot help. It is said that the entire committee holds this opinion and is now planning to save 45,941 yuan by cutting English language learning subsidies, housing subsidies, etc. It is also said that 246,726 yuan will be allocated from the special budget to make up for the shortage. A new committee will be appointed soon to study a long-term plan to balance income and expenditure and will eventually pay attention to reducing staff, reducing salaries, and revising donation rates. As for the cuts in subsidies that were planned to be implemented from January 1st of this year, they are still limited to senior personnel. The regular budget for 1937 will reach 9,786,115 yuan, including 5,490,000 in donation tax revenue and 2,137,000 in license revenue. The police administration expenses for this year are calculated to be 3,067,531 yuan.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Opposing the Public Works Bureau's Collection of Medicine Donations</p>
<p>In the summer of last year, the French Concession Board of Directors suddenly had the act of collecting donations for the Chinese medicine and medicine dispensing regulations, ranging from 25 yuan to 10 yuan per year. The national medicine stores in the entire district, because they have no legal basis and also have no ability to do so during this commercial downturn, have requested the National Medicine Industry Association to negotiate with the French Board of Directors based on reason, but have not been successful. At the end of the year, the French Board of Directors sent Chinese and foreign personnel to notify the various national medicine stores to reduce the collection by half, and said that if it is not paid before the 12th, the water and electricity will be cut off. The various national medicine stores are indignant that they have not accumulated water and electricity bills. How can they be unreasonably oppressed? So they held two district representative conferences on the 8th and 9th. Although it was raining and snowing, all of them participated, which shows the tension of the situation. It has been found that there are many resolution plans: (1) If the means of cutting off electricity and water are used to oppress, one family encounters it, the entire district will strike in protest, and all the representatives have sworn to pass it. (2) If necessary, launch a joint action by colleagues throughout the city. (3) Those who suffer from the pain of cutting off water and electricity are not limited to one family and one industry, and should promote the unanimous opposition of Chinese taxpayers in the entire French Concession district. (4) Submit a petition to the City Party Headquarters, the City Government, and the City Chamber of Commerce for public relations negotiations, and ask various public groups for sympathy and support, and issue a strike declaration after the implementation of the water and electricity cut off, and the rest are omitted.</p>

<p>Archbishop Cai Ning Presided Over the Commemorative Mass, and General President Lu Bohong Reported on the Bureau's Affairs</p>
<p>The Catholic Central Bureau of China is an organization of Catholic believers dedicated to handling three major areas: charity, education, and evangelization. Founded in the first year of the Republic of China, it has branches in various parts of the country. This year marks the 25th anniversary of its establishment. Yesterday at 4 p.m., a silver jubilee ceremony was held in the grand hall of the bureau in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, presided over by Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Nuncio to China. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>High national flags and Papal flags stood at the entrance of the bureau. Horizontally arranged electric lights spelled out "Silver Jubilee Commemoration." Inside the venue, colorful ribbons were everywhere. Inscriptions from all walks of life adorned the walls, and large and small flower baskets shone brightly.</p>
<p>Order of Proceedings</p>
<p>(1) Music, (2) Opening address by Cai, the Archbishop and concurrently the National Supervisor of the Catholic Central Bureau, (3) Report on the bureau's affairs by General President Lu, (4) Address by Bishop Hui, (5) Address by Bishop Yu, (6) Speech by Dean Zhang, the directing priest, (7) Archbishop Cai, representing the Pope, awards the Cross of Honor, (8) Performance by students of Zheng Xiu Middle School, (9) Music, (10) Completion of the ceremony and adjournment.</p>
<p>Attending Religious Believers</p>
<p>Archbishop Cai Ning, Bishop Hui of the Shanghai Diocese, Bishop Yu of the Nanjing Diocese, Bishop Tian of the Hangzhou Diocese, Vice-Bishop Jin, President Sang, Dean Zhang, Dean Yao, Dean Leng, Father Xu, chief editor of the Holy Church Magazine, Father Ding, the editor of the Sacred Heart Daily, Lu Bohong, Zhu Zhiyao, Dong Junfu, Lu Yigeng, He Lizhong, Wang Baolun, and more than 500 members in total.</p>
<p>Archbishop Cai's Admonition</p>
<p>Archbishop Cai Ning spoke first, mainly emphasizing: (1) Deeply study the doctrines of the Holy Church, elevate thinking, and suppress sin. (2) Cultivate a spirit of sacrifice, not fearing hardship, not begrudging wealth, and being prepared to go to any lengths. (3) Encourage receiving the Holy Eucharist, so as to obtain abundant divine grace and blessings.</p>
<p>Abstract of the Report</p>
<p>Subsequently, President Lu Bohong reported on the bureau's affairs, stating: 89 clinics have provided medical care to 9,695,086 people; 20 schools have been established with 1,838 students and 69 teachers; 108 preaching venues have been set up, with 40,320 preaching sessions, attended by 1,562,079 people; 27,094 people have been converted; 337,854 people have been baptized; 30 churches have been built through independent construction, and over 50 churches have been assisted in construction, with a total expenditure of approximately 8 million yuan. There are over 100 branches nationwide, with more than 150,000 male and female members.</p>
<p>Bishop Yu's Admonition</p>
<p>Bishop Yu's remarks mainly stated: According to General President Lu's report, it is as if reading a new painting in imagination. In this large garden of the Catholic Central Bureau, there is an extremely bright and splendid corner (referring to the Shanghai area), colorful and fragrant. This is all thanks to General President Lu, serving as the leader of the members, guiding all members and working hard to cultivate the fruits of their efforts. He also stated that the continuous work of the Shanghai Catholic Central Bureau for 25 years has made great strides in charity, education, and evangelization. However, after the silver jubilee, cultural and social enterprises should be the new focus of efforts. Cultural enterprises include book publishing and the newspaper industry, while social enterprises include rural relief and cooperative ventures. These are all needed by the Catholic Church. The Pope is calling loudly for believers to actively participate in these works. The Central Bureau has not yet achieved results in these two major areas. It is hoped that new apostles of cultural and social enterprises will emerge from all departments of the Shanghai Central Bureau. Following past experience and working hard, there will surely be a day when things come naturally. It must be known that our work is not only to save the dead, but also to save the living; not only to remove temporary suffering, but also to find a long-term solution. Loving people should also mean loving society, and saving people should also mean saving society, starting with the entire social system. Bishop Yu concluded by expressing his deep hope that at the 50-year golden jubilee, under the leadership of General President Lu, the Central Bureau will not only continue to report on charity, education, and evangelization, but also report on the achievements of cultural and social enterprises, which is his greatest and most earnest hope.</p>
<p>Bishop Hui's Admonition</p>
<p>Bishop Hui's admonition stated in general: Today, the Catholic Central Bureau is holding its silver jubilee. The intention of this commemoration is no different from a milestone on the roadside, indicating the process and proclaiming the future. In these 25 years, your sacrifices of spirit and wealth, and the contribution of tangible things, all stem from the supernatural foundation of loving God above and loving others below. As the Apostle Paul said, "Demonstrate the truth with love." The past road has been so bright and splendid, and the future journey is long and extensive. It is even more important to redouble our efforts and concentrate our minds to go forward. Recalling when this bishop was consecrated, he prayed to God for strong assistants. In addition to the clergy bearing this inherent responsibility, it truly depends on the members of the Catholic Central Bureau acting as left and right hands, exerting their full strength to assist in continuing to advance in the future, so that we can enter the path of light even more. He also said that the current Pope attaches the greatest importance to the work of the Catholic Central Bureau, so he bestowed upon Mr. Lu the most honorable title of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, urging everyone to respect the Holy See's intentions, lead the entire bureau, and diligently and tirelessly advance forward.</p>
<p>Special Conferment of Medals</p>
<p>Lu Yigeng is the third son of Mr. Bohong. Young, handsome, capable, and energetic, he assists his father in planning various charitable enterprises. Mr. Lu currently serves as the vice president of Sacred Heart Hospital and Puji Sanitarium, and the principal of Zhengxiu Elementary School and Ren'ai Elementary School. In 1933, the Chinese Roman Pilgrimage Group unanimously elected Mr. Lu as the general leader, leading the group members to visit various countries, make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and meet with the Pope, who personally praised him. This time, his father was awarded the title of Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by the Pope, and Mr. Lu was also specially awarded the Vatican Gold Grand Cross of Honor by the Pope to recognize his merits. At yesterday's silver jubilee ceremony of the Catholic Central Bureau, Archbishop Cai, representing the Pope, conferred the medal. The meaning of the cross is that Mr. Lu is responsible for assisting his father in running various charitable and educational undertakings, not shirking hard work, and has a ribbon attached to it, indicating obedience and conformity to the Pope's will.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notified the French Ambassador Regarding Participation in the Paris Exposition</h3>
<p>The French government will hold an International Exposition in Paris on May 1st of this year. Previously, Li Shizeng, Chu Minyi, and others, together with leaders of various circles under the Department of Culture and Education, jointly initiated and organized the Chinese Association for Participation in the Paris International Exposition. In addition to establishing a delegation office (at 195 Lafayette Road), the association also set up a collection point for exhibits in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, appointed staff to be responsible for collecting items and guarding them, and hired Xu Xiaochu, Xie Zhongfu, Dai Chunfeng, and Zhou Maoyang as collection commissioners to actively collect exhibits. A few days ago, the delegation office sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that it instruct the embassy in France to negotiate for land rentals, and also to notify the French ambassador to attach a list of the delegation members, report the progress and nature of China's participation in the exposition to the French government and the general office of the exposition, and treat the Chinese delegation the same as the government delegations of other countries, and provide them with various conveniences. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied, stating that it has handled everything accordingly. In addition to notifying the French ambassador, it has also urgently telegraphed the embassy in France to quickly lease a site and build a Chinese exhibition hall.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Postpones Medical Treatment for Chronic Illness</h3>

<h3>The Shanghai Monetary Trade Reserve Prepared to Receive Last Year's Coupon Interest</h3>
<p>Estimated to Obtain 180,000 National Currency Yuan, 120,000 Yuan Will Be Entered into the Public Account</p>
<p>The Shanghai Monetary Trade Joint Reserve was established in the 21st year of the Republic of China. Its purpose is to consolidate the foundation of the entire industry, regulate finance, and handle joint reserve matters. It has been five years since then. The total amount of reserves has exceeded 3 million yuan. A reporter from the New Voice learned from the reserve yesterday that, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of its charter, it cannot engage in external business. Therefore, the reserve does not engage in external business and has no so-called surplus. After the year-end accounting today, regarding the coupon interest received from the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications (a total of 7 million yuan, of which 2.8 million yuan is interest), estimated to obtain 180,000 national currency yuan, it has now been decided to allocate 120,000 national currency yuan to the public account.</p>
<h3>The National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation Will Open on February 1st</h3>
<p>Tomorrow's Reception for the Press</p>
<p>After government approval, the National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation has been prepared and is scheduled to commence operations on February 1st. It will hold a reception for newspaper reporters at the Atlantic Restaurant on Simalu (Fourth Avenue) at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow (Monday) to report on the purpose of its establishment and operational details.</p>
<h3>Request to Continue Negotiations on Inspection of Factories in the Concessions</h3>
<p>The Manufacturers Association Submitted a Document to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the request to continue negotiations on the inspection of factories in the concessions to ensure industrial safety: In recent times, with the progress of material things, factory enterprises have become increasingly developed. All countries in the world pay close attention to factory equipment and conduct inspections at any time to ensure perfection and benefit laborers. Shanghai is an area with many factories. In the past, due to a lack of attention, disasters occurred from time to time. Your government, concerned about laborers and protecting industries, has repeatedly negotiated with the authorities of various concessions to implement factory inspections. However, foreigners have used consular jurisdiction as an excuse and have not accepted the inspections, causing negotiations to stall for many years. As a result, accidental events in factories in the concessions occur frequently, and many people have lost their lives. This is enough to expose the shortcomings of factory equipment in the concessions. Our association, as a group of national products factories, cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specifically request that your government continue to negotiate to achieve the goal of Chinese industry and workers being protected by Chinese law. This would be fortunate for the laborers and fortunate for the country. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>The Japanese Yen Exchange Rate in Shanghai is Chaotic After Japan Regulates Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Foreign Banks Selling Off En Masse, Japanese Merchants Buying In Forcefully to Maintain the Rate</p>
<p>The New Voice reports that after Japan announced the Foreign Exchange Control Law and began regulating foreign exchange, the Japanese yen exchange rate in Shanghai was chaotic. Foreign merchants were selling off en masse, and Japanese merchants were buying in large amounts to maintain the exchange rate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chaotic Trading</p>
<p>The Central Bank announced the yen exchange rate as 103 yen to 100 national currency yuan, while the British-owned HSBC Bank announced the yen exchange rate as 103.375 yen to 100 national currency yuan. However, the market trading was very chaotic. Foreign banks (except for Japanese banks) and Chinese banks were selling off Japanese yen en masse. Therefore, the exchange rate announced by HSBC Bank yesterday was 0.25 yuan lower than the previous day, while the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank yesterday did not involve actual transactions, which proves that the Japanese yen has devalued.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Maintaining</p>
<p>Japanese banks such as Yokohama Specie, Taiwan, Korea, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Shanghai, and Hankou were trying to maintain the yen exchange rate in order to prevent it from collapsing. Therefore, starting yesterday, they bought in large amounts and worked hard to stabilize it. Except for Japanese merchants, no merchants from other countries were buying. Although Japanese banks are working hard to stabilize the rate, whether they can maintain it in the past is currently a major issue.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The devaluation of the Japanese yen is unrelated to the foreign exchange rates of other countries, such as Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and Hong Kong. Therefore, the foreign exchange rates of the Central Bank yesterday were very stable. London was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, New York was 30 US dollars, Paris was 630 francs, Berlin was 73.5 marks, and Hong Kong was 97 Hong Kong dollars. The foreign exchange rates of HSBC Bank were 1 shilling and 2.375 pence for British pound, 29.375 yuan for US dollar, 629 francs for French franc, 72.5 marks for German mark, and 96.75 Hong Kong dollars for Hong Kong dollar.</p>

<h3>Bandits Rob a Yunfei Car and Kidnap Yang Ruisheng</h3>
<p>Yang is a Contractor and Has Been Kidnapped Twice, After the Car Was Found, a Handgun and Bullets Were Seized</p>
<p>At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, two people wearing black and gray cotton robes and one person wearing a blue cloth jacket, speaking with local accents, came to the Yunfei taxi station next to the Nanjing Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII, claiming they wanted to rent a car to Longhua. The driver, Wu Jinhai (38 years old, from Ningbo, driver's license number 25520), drove the car with municipal license number 4434 and concession permit number 12292. Unexpectedly, when they drove to a location near the No. 119 pole next to the tomb garden of Lujiayan, west of the defense post of the Longhua Road Jinji Road Ta Chao Dong small wooden bridge on South Shanghai Longhua Road, the three bandits suddenly showed handguns and ordered them to stop, claiming to know the situation. The driver, knowing he had encountered bandits, allowed them to arrange things. He was driven down, and one bandit in a blue cloth jacket put on the driver's hat and drove the car away at high speed. The remaining bandits dragged the driver into the nearby graveyard, first stuffing his mouth with pre-prepared cotton, tying his hands behind his back with hemp rope, and pushing him to the ground before leaving. It was dusk, and the location was remote with few pedestrians. The driver struggled for an hour and ten minutes before managing to free himself. He ran to the nearby Longhua Road Defense Corps and telegraphed the Yunfei taxi head office on Route Cardinal Mercier, who sent another car to pick him up and bring him to the Xinxiqu police station, who transferred him to the Ximen branch. Passing by the French-owned water tower on Xujiahui Road Lujiawan, they saw the car that had been robbed abandoned on the side of the road. Inside the car, there was a six-inch handgun, two bullets, and a hat, one of the car door handles was broken, fortunately there was no other damage, the parts were intact, so Wu Jinhai drove it to the Yunfei taxi station next to the Chen Ying Shii Memorial Tower in Ximen of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. An employee from the Yunfei head office filled out the receipt and drove it back to the Yunfei taxi station next to the Chen Ying Shii Memorial Tower in Ximen to continue to supply it for hire. However, according to information obtained by the police agency, the bandits robbed the No. 12292 car at around 6:30 p.m. and drove to the vicinity of No. 332 Lane of Seymour Road to wait. At that time, Yang Ruisheng, a nearly sixty-year-old man from Pudong who lived at No. 15 of the lane (started his career as a building contractor and owns the Yang Rui Ji Construction Factory), was returning from the Qinglian Court teahouse in a rented rickshaw No. 2869, pulled by the rickshaw puller Lu Zhijiang from Tongzhou. As soon as the bandits in the car saw him, they jumped out of the car, punched Lu Zhijiang in the face when he was not prepared, and Lu immediately fell to the ground. The bandits then kidnapped Yang Ruisheng, jumped back into the car, and sped away. By the time Lu Zhijiang got up, the bandit's car had long disappeared. He returned home to report the incident and sought help from the Jing'an Temple police station under whose jurisdiction the area fell. After Hua Detective Tang Keng and others went to investigate, they assigned detectives to search in all directions. It was learned that Yang Ruisheng had been kidnapped once before on February 2, 1927. The bandits demanded a large sum of money. After repeated private negotiations, he was released. This is the second time he has been kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Ringing the Doorbell to Report Injustice</h3>
<p>The Local Court Vigorously Implements Oral Lawsuits, and Judicial Organs in Various Places Should Urgently Follow Suit</p>
<p>Lu Yimei, the president of the Shanghai Local Court, and Zhu Huanbiao, the chief prosecutor, believe that Shanghai has many lawsuits, and impoverished people who have been wronged and have urgent matters have neither the ability to hire lawyers nor the time to write complaints. At the same time, receiving complaints and dividing cases also delays the process. In order to vigorously implement oral lawsuits, similar to the old Qing county government's method of beating drums to report injustice, a doorbell is installed on the wall of the civil and criminal reporting office inside the second door of the main gate on the west side of the court. A separate line connects to the chief prosecutor's office and the bailiff's office. If a person has a grievance to report, they only need to press the doorbell, and the chief prosecutor's office and the bailiff's office will ring at the same time. The bailiff will immediately take the person reporting the grievance, and the chief prosecutor will immediately send a prosecutor to open an investigation court for questioning. If the complaint is true, the defendant will be immediately arrested and prosecuted. If the complaint is a malicious accusation or intentional harassment, they will also be immediately punished. After submitting a report to the Jiangsu High Court, it was considered that this method was feasible, and it has been forwarded to the Ministry of Justice for record. The Shanghai Court was informed to implement it starting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Extortion Attempt Fails, Sentenced to Ten Months</h3>
<p>Li Daocai, a native of Ningbo and the general manager of the Victory Medical Instrument Company in the Zhonghe Building on Shansi Road, lived at No. 2, Shunde Lane, Avenue Haig. On the 28th of last month, Li suddenly received a pair of threatening letters from a gang named He Yeshan, attempting to extort 1,000 legal currency yuan, and instructed him to send the money to the Feilong Dance School at No. 3, Yuren Lane, Yuchaqing Road. After receiving the letter, Li immediately reported it to the Xinzha police station, who ordered Detective Huang Siming to go to the address and arrest the suspect, He Awu, a native of Ningbo. They found that He had also written a threatening letter on December 28 of last year to Xu Jinsheng, who lived at No. 33, Jiuchang Lane, Xinzha Road, attempting to extort 1,000 yuan. He was escorted to the First Special Court for questioning and is awaiting trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin presided over the eighth criminal court and announced the verdict. The main text stated, "He Awu, jointly and continuously attempting to obtain property by intimidation, is sentenced to ten months of imprisonment. The two letters and one business card are confiscated."</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of a Fish Vendor Truck Overturning, Li Yuanhan Has Died</h3>
<p>The Driver is Suspected of Negligence, and the Police Station Has Filed a Public Prosecution with the Court</p>
<p>Yang Yuding, a native of Xuzhou, was driving truck No. 1729, fully loaded with thirty fish vendors, from the 16th pier to the fish market at around 3:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. When passing the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Qiwupu Road, there was a bicycle in front of him. Yang tried to avoid it, but because he was driving at full speed, he could not avoid it and knocked the bicycle down. Seeing that he had caused an accident, Yang quickly turned the steering wheel, but crashed into two large trees on the side of the road, causing the entire truck to overturn. Fish vendors Shao Heshang, Zhou Aixing, Li Chugen, Wang Ada, Huang Qiankun, Kong Kuangsheng, Zheng Muquan, Shen Fengshi, Yang Heqing, Li Hongqing, and Li Yuanhan, who was riding the bicycle, were all seriously injured. After the police officers received the report and arrived, they transported the injured to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. After investigating the circumstances, it was determined that the driver, Yang Yuding, was indeed negligent, and he was detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and prosecuted him for negligent injury under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. Because all the injured parties were still in the hospital, he requested a postponement of the hearing. After questioning by Judge Ye Shengchao, he was ordered to be remanded in custody and await further hearing at a later date. Li Yuanhan, because he was more seriously injured, died at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday after ineffective treatment. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Song of the First Special Court determined that he had died from the collision, and the body was temporarily claimed by Yin Bin Yuan for coffin encoffinment.</p>
<h3>Fortune Teller Tragically Crushed to Death by a Car</h3>
<p>Zhao Shizhai, a native of Huai'an, 40 years old, earned a living by setting up a fortune-telling stall on the banks of the Macgregor Road Xinzha Bridge. At around 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Zhao needed to use the restroom, so he went to a nearby toilet. After finishing, he hurried back, but at that moment, a public bus No. 15038 of the Tenth Route was speeding from east to west. Zhao was walking quickly with his head down and did not pay attention, and the driver of the bus was unable to brake in time, causing Zhao to be hit head-on by the public bus. He was thrown two or three zhang away and fell to the ground, his head hitting the road, his skull shattered, and blood gushed out like a spring. His brain matter flowed out, and he died instantly. When the patrol officer saw this, he quickly summoned an ambulance, but it was too late.

<h3>Drug Trafficking Must Be Punished by Death</h3>
<p>Drug Offenders in the Concessions are Also Judged According to the Law, Zhou A'gen Detained for Drug Use and Trafficking</p>
<p>Since this year, anyone who manufactures, transports, sells, or consumes drugs will be punished by death according to the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Crimes, as announced by the Songhu Headquarters. However, the general population who manufacture, transport, sell, and consume red pills, white powder, morphine, cocaine, heroin, etc. in the concessions still mistakenly believe that these anti-drug regulations will not apply to the concession areas. They continue to harbor侥倖 psychological and continue to manufacture, sell, and consume as before. However, this is not the case. It must be known that the judicial organs in the concessions now abide by Chinese law and are no longer comparable to the past. The day before yesterday, Guo Ruiyu, an anti-drug agent, arrested Zhou A'gen, a local, in the front room on the third floor of No. 62, North Shansi Road, for privately smoking and selling drugs. Ten small packets of heroin, two opium pipes, and two opium lamps were seized on the spot. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a complaint against Zhou based on Article 4 of the Anti-Drug Regulations (those who sell or intend to sell and possess drugs shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment). After lawyer Li explained the process of solving the case, Zhou confessed that he bought these drugs from a Japanese person at No. 5, Yule Lane, Qiujiang Road, for 18 packs per yuan, and he sold them for one cent per pack. He repeatedly thought of quitting, but had no funds for rehabilitation, so he continued in this way. A few days ago, he met a detective who asked him to place the drug packages on the table so that the detectives could come to search, and if he was detained in the police station, he could be sent to the hospital for rehabilitation, etc. The judge believed that the case was important, so he appointed a lawyer for the defense and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and wait for sentencing next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Huang Jiaju Accuses Kan Duo's Daughter</h3>
<p>Cousins in Litigation: The Goal is to Contest the Inheritance</p>
<p>Kan Duo, courtesy name Huochu (deceased), former Director of the Railway Bureau of the Puppet State of Manchukuo, his fourth daughter, Kan Suwan, also known as Suwan (resident at 60 Rue Lastre), is being privately prosecuted in the District Court by her cousin, Huang Jiaju (26 years old, from Hefei, Anhui), a university student residing at 694 Dalianwan Road, represented by lawyer Ding Wei, for false accusation, theft, and unlawful detention. The prosecution alleges that the defendant is the fourth daughter of the late Kan Huochu, the plaintiff's maternal uncle. Because the late uncle had no sons, he showed Huang Jiaju exceptional favor, teaching him from a young age and providing generous financial support for his studies. Upon adulthood, he strongly supported and promoted Huang Jiaju. Though their relationship was that of uncle and nephew, their affection was akin to father and son. Sadly, misfortune struck, and in the second month of the year before last, Huochu suddenly fell ill and died during a trip to Shenyang. At the time, Huang Jiaju was also seriously ill and receiving treatment in a hospital, unable to attend his uncle or receive his final words. By the time he recovered and returned, the funeral arrangements were complete. Previously, Huochu had prepared a will disposing of all his assets, including a bequest to Huang Jiaju, which was clearly stated in the will. Furthermore, those present at the time, such as Kan Chaoxi, Chen Yi, and Tao Lanquan, were also deeply aware of the situation. The defendant, however, is cold and unfeeling, disregarding the will and refusing to grant Huang Jiaju the inheritance due to him. Despite repeated attempts at negotiation, she remained indifferent, delaying for nearly three years. In the summer of the twenty-fifth year, Huang Jiaju learned that the defendant had moved her entire family south to Shanghai. He also came to Shanghai to attempt to negotiate with her, but she was avoiding the summer heat in Qingdao, preventing them from meeting. Unexpectedly, upon returning from Qingdao, the defendant preemptively reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, falsely accusing Huang Jiaju of stealing her jewelry. On September 16th, Huang Jiaju and his friend Cao Jiandong were arrested and detained for many days without interrogation. The defendant then requested the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to send Huang Jiaju to the Caohejing Vagrant Work Training Center. Subsequently, Huang Jiaju hired a lawyer who sent a letter of inquiry, and on October 22nd, the bureau brought Huang Jiaju back from the training center and transferred him to the Prosecutor's Office, which dismissed the charges and released him. Therefore, the plaintiff requests legal punishment for her crimes, and so on. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the court session. The defendant was absent, with the bailiff reporting that she had gone to Hangzhou. The plaintiff stated that he had met her yesterday. The court ordered another summons to be issued.

<p>Urgent Need for Vaccination</p>
<p>Zhou concluded, "In the past year, 87 people died from smallpox in this port, while in the past month alone, there were 36 deaths. The situation is very serious. We deeply hope that citizens will quickly go to vaccination locations designated by the Chinese Concession Health Authority to request vaccination. Parents should especially have their children vaccinated against smallpox. Otherwise, neglecting this even slightly may lead to regret too late."</p>
<p>Declaration of Infected Port</p>
<p>The text of the Seaport Quarantine Office's announcement is as follows: "Investigation reveals that smallpox is currently prevalent in Shanghai. All passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong and other ports should first report to the Shanghai Quarantine Office at 2 Beijing Road to request vaccination and obtain a vaccination certificate to avoid difficulties upon arrival at those ports.

<h3>Chinese and Western Detectives Go to Dalian to Rescue Two Prostitutes and Return Them to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Kidnappers Also Separately Escorted to Shanghai; Court Orders a Date for Examination and Interrogation</p>
<p>Zhang Fengying, a 14-year-old girl from Wuxi, residing at the home of her relative Yang Changwen at 21 Mao Hai Road, disappeared on the ninth of last month after being abducted. The Hongkou Police Station was notified. Subsequently, Chinese detectives Feng Qishan and Xia Shutang arrested two suspects, Liu Fengsheng and Zhang Changbao, from Changzhou, and escorted them to the First Special District Court. They confessed that several accomplices had taken Zhang to Qingdao to be sold. They were ordered to be held in custody. Recently, the police station dispatched detectives Feng and Xia, along with Western detective Ayers, to Qingdao. Working with the local Public Security Bureau, they arrested five accomplices at the Qingdao Eryitai Chaoyang Hotel and the Huaxing Public Hotel on Yinxi Road: Lu Jiale from Yangzhou, Wang Runzhi, a woman named Zhang Chenshi, Bao Zishan from Anhui, and Ma Gongchen from Shandong. They learned that Zhang had been sold to the Lebaoshan brothel at 12 Zhiergou, Sifangyuan, Dalian, for 190 yuan. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to Dalian (which is a Japanese concession) and paid 190 yuan to Lebaoshan to redeem Zhang. They also rescued Zhu Xiuying, a girl from Huzhou, who had been lured into the brothel by a kidnapper named Zhang Laowu. They then arrested Ling Defu from Yangzhou, who was responsible for sending Zhang to Dalian. The two women and Lu Jiale and the others were put on the Fengtian steamship and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. They were brought to the police station. Zhang was taken back by her relative Yang Changwen. Zhu, because she had no family in Shanghai, was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and requested a postponement to combine the trial with Liu Fengsheng. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported on the process of arresting the defendants in Qingdao. Zhang and Zhu testified about the circumstances of their abduction. When questioned, Lu Jiale and the others gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiefen ruled that they should remain in custody and set another date for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbers Pre-Arrange a Car to Steal a Small Silver Box</h3>
<p>First, They Called a Car Company Posing as Someone Else to Rent a Car; Unable to Open the Box, the Robbers Simply Carried it Away</p>
<p>Da Wen, Hua Xin, and Guang Xin Printing and Book Bureau, located at 38 Ning'an Lane, 997 North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road, also prints picture cards and calendars, and its business is doing well. However, it has attracted the attention of robbers. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 6:30 p.m., six robbers suddenly arrived. Four of them were armed. Four robbers entered through the front door and two entered through the back door. They first held up more than ten employees and apprentices, leading them to a small room upstairs and guarding them. They then demanded the keys to the silver box from the employees, hoping to open the Da Wen Book Bureau's empty silver box downstairs, but were unable to do so because they did not have the keys. The robbers then went to the Hua Xin and Guang Xin accounting room upstairs. At this time, there was a sudden knock at the door. It was a chauffeur who had come to ask if they had hired a car. The robbers inside answered in the affirmative and told the chauffeur to wait a moment. The chauffeur was unaware of the situation and was also taken into custody by the robbers, who forced him into the small room upstairs to be watched. At the same time, one of the robbers ran out of the lane and drove the car into Ning'an Lane. The other four robbers were still upstairs, trying to force open the silver box. However, because the accountant, Ding, happened to be out, they were unable to open it. The five robbers, in a fit of desperation, worked together to steal the small silver box from the accounting room, carried it downstairs, put it in the car, and sped out of the lane. After the robbers left, those who had been detained were freed. When questioned about his presence, the chauffeur said that his name was Chen Dexing and that he worked for the Southern Automobile Company on Avenue Edward VII. At approximately 6:20 p.m., the car company received a phone call from someone claiming to be from the Da Wen Book Bureau at 38 Ning'an Lane, Haining Road, wanting to hire a car. Therefore, the car company ordered Chen to drive rental car number 12695 to the location. The owners then realized that the robbers had been planning this all along. They immediately reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, requesting an investigation. It is understood that there were over 1,000 yuan in banknotes in the stolen silver box, as well as important documents and files. After learning of the incident, the police station dispatched detectives to investigate and notified all police agencies in the city, requesting assistance in locating the car. At approximately 8:30 p.m., car number 12695 was found at the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinza Road. However, there was no sign of the robbers or the silver box. The beat officer reported this to the police station, which took the car back for inspection and notified the Southern Automobile Company to retrieve it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Further Instructions Were Issued to All Railway Bureaus</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received instruction number 4734 from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated: "Approved is official letter number 4077 from the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently Director-General of the Opium Suppression Bureau, stating: 'Approved is the report from the Railway Police Headquarters stating that the Pinghan Railway Police Department reported that the section chief of the Xingyan section reported that at 1:50 p.m. on October 14th of last year, the 7th and 11th express trains arrived at the station and unloaded two wicker baskets and one leather suitcase.

The deputy stationmaster was then joined to open the items, and they found 80 packets of the drug 'red pill,' weighing 77 kilograms. The drug was then sent to the Henan office of the Opium Suppression Inspectorate. A formal document is now being submitted for review. As such, the procedure for inspecting joint transport luggage upon arrival at the destination station was previously communicated to your ministry and the police headquarters for compliance on August 6th of the 25th year, in official letter number 2542 from the Opium Suppression Bureau. It is imperative to pay attention to the smuggling of drugs. This case occurred because the felon escaped due to a lack of attention beforehand. In addition to issuing instructions, we are sending another official letter requesting that you review the previous case and thoroughly instruct your staff to pay attention. Although this is the case, this ministry previously approved a letter from the Military Affairs Commission stating that for joint transport luggage picked up outside of inspection hours, the stationmaster should instruct the railway police to inspect it together when the items are picked up. If there are privately transported drugs, it is certain that the suspect will try to escape. Special attention should be paid to the situation during inspection. This was previously communicated in an official order. Now that the preceding has been approved, in addition to issuing separate instructions, we are reiterating the previous order and instructing the railway to comply strictly to emphasize the importance of opium suppression. This order.'"</p>

<h3>Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital Revokes Registration License</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital on the corner of Haining Road and Ke Xiong Road was opened by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan. Since its establishment, its business has been slow. Shen Zhaoquan, with far-fetched ideas, specialized in recruiting medical students to achieve his fraudulent purposes. In March of the 24th year, he advertised for recruitment, which was ordered to be banned by the former Ministry of Interior Health Department, and issued to this city's Health Bureau. Shen Zhaoquan, obstinately unrepentant, advertised for recruitment twice again on August 13th and October 28th of the 25th year. The Health and Social Bureaus jointly sent personnel to investigate and found that students Lu Yingjun, Deng Lichao, and others all expressed regret at being deceived and requested assistance. The bureaus separately issued warnings and ordered the students to be dismissed and tuition fees to be refunded. However, after several months, Shen Zhaoquan ignored the orders and deceived the Social Bureau, claiming that the students had already been dismissed, to cover up his deceitful crimes. The bureaus, recognizing that Shen Zhaoquan had repeatedly committed illegal acts, disregarded government orders, and deceived youth, leaving no room for further leniency, revoked his doctor's registration license and ordered him to cease operations. The Social Bureau strictly ordered him to dismiss the students and refund their tuition fees as punishment and to deter others from following suit.</p>

<h3>Chen Qiucao's Exhibition to Aid Sui Reaches Its Final Day</h3>
<p>The Chen Qiucao Lyric Development Exhibition, a pioneering effort in the art world to aid Suiyuan, has been open since the beginning of the New Year and has lasted for over a week. All sectors of Shanghai have paid exceptional attention to it, and various newspapers have published eulogies, praising it as a great and deeply meaningful demonstration. Despite the severe cold, the number of viewers has been high, mainly because, although many painting exhibitions have been held in recent years, few have had the substantial content, stimulating themes, and profound impact on people as Chen's exhibition. In recent days, both Chinese and foreign reporters have visited the exhibition to view it, and writers have recorded detailed accounts. Famous photographers Lu Shifu and Ao Huan Gong have personally taken photographs of the grand occasion of the venue. The Chinese painter Wang Geyi also composed a poem on the spot to congratulate the exhibition. Viewers were deeply moved by Chen's sincerity in exhibiting paintings to aid Suiyuan and the enthusiasm and abundance of his works, and many lingered, reluctant to leave. Today is the last day of the exhibition, and those who love art and are enthusiastic about the aid-Suiyuan movement should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Association Plans to Allocate Another 20,000 Yuan to Huixui for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong Arrive in Sui – Telegram Reports the Bitter Suffering of Disaster in Sui</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, recognizing the urgent need for relief for the disaster victims in the Suiyuan area, specially dispatched Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong, standing committee members of the association, carrying a large quantity of winter clothing and medicines for disaster relief. It is now learned that the association received a telegram yesterday from Yang and Feng, stating: "The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association understands that Cai et al. arrived in Guisui on Yu Ri'an and were warmly welcomed by all sectors. According to local officials and gentry, the unprecedented victory in the Sui battle was due to the meritorious service of the soldiers, but the unity and shared hatred of the enemy among the people of all regions was even more crucial. Consequently, many were wounded, and the damage to houses, livestock, and implements is being investigated. Currently, the residents of the war zone are without clothing, food, or shelter, wandering and displaced, suffering from hunger and cold, in extreme misery, urgently requiring relief for no less than tens of thousands of people. In addition to the allocation of 100,000 yuan, it is hoped that funds will be raised quickly and continuously provided to save the lives of all. Ye et al. are scheduled to depart with the committee and provincial officials to inspect the affected areas, with further reports to follow. Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong bow in respect." It is also learned that after receiving the telegram, the association plans to first allocate another 20,000 yuan to Huixui for disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers Prevented from Visiting Relatives After Secretly Leaving with Their Father's Belongings</h3>
<p>Currently Held at the Railway Police Department, Awaiting Relatives to Claim Them and Take Them Home</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM yesterday, at the South Railway Station, railway police officer Wang Deying discovered two boys, approximately twelve or thirteen years old, at the station. They claimed they wanted to buy tickets to travel to Xieqiao to visit relatives. Officer Wang, concerned that the two children were young and traveling far, fearing they might encounter an accident, questioned them in detail. He learned their names were Zhou Zhongkui, thirteen years old, and Zhou Yanzhong, twelve years old, brothers. Their father's name is Zhou Shusong, from Haining, and he works at the Donglai Photo Studio on Dongmen Road, Xiaodongmen, residing at No. 60, Fengyu Lane, Sappho Road in the French Concession. They had studied at Zhuqiao Elementary School in their hometown. At 9:00 AM yesterday, they stole a piece of clothing from their father, pawned it for eight jiao, and planned to take the train to Xieqiao to visit their aunt, the Shen family, and so on. They were taken to the Railway Police Department to await relatives to claim them and take them home.</p>
<h3>Ye Linsheng Searches for Wife, Wife Denies Being Married</h3>
<p>Ye Linsheng, a Taoist priest from Zhitang, Taicang, in his prime, married Ms. Ba Ruibao (currently 25 years old) from the same village ten years ago. They had a child, now seven years old. Ba Ruishi left in the 23rd year (a previous report mistakenly stated the 13th year), saying she was going to Shanghai to work as a servant, and never returned. There has been no news since. After Ruishi came to Shanghai, she was introduced by someone and married Zhou Zhaozhang (from Ningbo), the owner of a milk shed in Fenglinqiao, West Shanghai, as a concubine. It was not until recently, after Ba Ruishi sent a letter to her mother, that Ba Yin'nan, Ruishi's cousin, learned of this and informed Ye Linsheng. Ye Linsheng came to Shanghai to find her and learned that Tang Xinfu, a matchmaker and fellow villager who owns a matchmaking shop at No. 49, Dongxinqiao Street, had arranged for Ruibao to remarry. Ye et al. went to Zhou's place and took Ruibao out, taking her to the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to stay, intending to take the train back to their hometown the next morning. However, the next morning, Tang Jinfu gathered people to the hotel and stopped Ba Ruibao from leaving. Ye Linsheng then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Tang Jinfu, Ba Suobao, and others of disrupting his family. After a preliminary hearing, the defendants did not appear, and it was announced that the date would be changed. This was reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over a continued hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The two defendants arrived with lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Ye Linsheng, testified that his wife was brought to Shanghai by Tang Xinlan in March of the 23rd year. This time, he found her at the milk shed, took her back to the hotel, and the next morning, Tang came and took his wife away. When Tang Jinfu was questioned, he denied participating in Ba Ruishi's marriage and denied having recommended Ba as a servant. He said that because Ye and Ba Yin'nan came to him to ask him to send a message, he asked Ruishi to meet at the hotel, but he did not stop Ye from taking Ruishi home. Ba Ruibao denied marrying Li and said that when she was young, her mother arranged an engagement for her, and the child was hers. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that after the previous court hearing, he suddenly received a criminal complaint from the First Special District Court, in which Ba Ruishi accused Ye Linsheng of restricting her freedom. Ba denied being married to Ye and did not admit to having a child. Ba Ruishi admitted to the news police that she was married to Ye and was willing to go home with her husband. The news police have a record. Whether Ba and Ye are formally married is a procedural question. He has requested the First Special District Court to investigate the news police record and presented a copy of the summons and complaint from the First Special District Court. He also stated that Ba Ruishi had hired a lawyer to publish a notice of divorce in the newspaper and presented the newspaper and the engagement documents. He requested that the file from the First Special District Court be investigated so that the truth could be clarified. Furthermore, Ba Ruibao's testimony in court today contradicts her testimony in the First Special District Court. He requested that this be noted in the record. When Ba Ruibao was questioned, she said that Hua Linsheng had come to cheat her. She was working as a servant at Li's residence at No. 5, Lane 302, Seymour Road, and had not married a Zhou family member. How could she have money to be cheated, so she accused Ye Linsheng of extortion? After verifying the testimony, it was decided that the hearing would be continued on the 16th. Tang Jinfu was released on bail.</p>

<p>Children's Special</p>
<h3>Setting a Year's Work Plan with the Lowest Standards</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>At the beginning of each year, almost every child always makes a plan that is as complete as possible. At the beginning of this year, I want to advise children to start with small things and do what they can with their lowest abilities. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Accumulate One Cent a Day: In general, children's savings plans always involve saving a dime or two a day. If you can save a dime or two every day, that's great, but saving a dime or two every day is almost like saving all your pocket money. Three or five days are no problem, but as the days go by, watching classmates eat snacks and candy is inevitable, and you can't help but regret that you shouldn't have saved so completely, leaving you with so little money in your hand. So you are unhappy to save, and all previous efforts are abandoned. So I now advocate accumulating one cent a day to develop the habit of saving. Fortunately, one cent won't affect your pocket money.</p>
<p>Do One Good Deed a Day: When making plans, you don't have to plan to save the country, save the nation, and other big problems. It's best to plan to do one good deed a day or to work for a while every day. For example, when walking on the street, if you see a vendor knocking over a load, help him pick it up. If you see a banana peel on the side of the street, pick it up and throw it in the trash can, and so on. If you plan to work once a day, then sweeping the floor, wiping the windows, and so on are all possible. These may seem to have no great significance, but they are very useful in cultivating a spirit of service. If a person can develop a spirit of service from childhood, he will not worry about not being able to stand up for what is right when he grows up.</p>
<p>Learn One Character a Day: Learning one character a day seems too little, but if we can really learn one character a day, that's enough. The so-called learning one character a day here needs to be explained. For example, if you learn the character "天" (tiān, sky), we don't just mean knowing the appearance of the character "天", knowing the pronunciation of the character "天", and being able to write it. At a minimum, you must fully understand the meaning of the character "天" and all the nouns and adjectives related to the character "天". Then, in the future, no matter where you read "天×" or "×天", you will be able to fully understand it. If you can also understand the usage of the character "天", that would naturally be even better.</p>
<p>The so-called "accumulate one cent a day", "do one good deed a day", and "learn one character a day" here are just the lowest standards. If you have a slightly stronger ability, you can naturally change "one" to "two" or "three", all of which are possible. The most important thing is to be consistent. If "accumulating two cents a day" is a bit difficult, it is better to "accumulate one cent a day" to avoid interruption. If the grades are excellent every year, then from the second year onwards, you may wish to slightly increase the standards you set. In this way, step by step, after ten years, you will become a young person with perseverance, responsibility, thrift, and great knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Four Little Heroes</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lu</p>
<p>Even in his twilight years, on this New Year's Day when everything is renewed, seeing the four children, all the same age and similar in appearance, coming to wish him a Happy New Year and calling him grandpa, filled Old Li's heart with infinite joy. He smiled and beckoned them to come closer, saying kindly, "It's so coincidental that you four children were born in the same year, and today you are all eleven years old. Now you are all studying in school, preparing to be people in the future. But what skills do you want to learn, and what things do you want to do in the future? You can take turns in order of seniority and tell me about it. ... Yuan, your birthday is the earliest, you speak first."</p>
<p>So Zhao Yuan stepped forward and said loudly:</p>
<p>"Our country has never had a complete legal system, and the people do not know the meaning of the law, so people's hearts are mostly bad, and everything is not on track. I am willing to study law and strive to create a country ruled by law."</p>
<p>Qian Heng, without waiting to be called, interjected:</p>
<p>"The law should be improved, but it is inevitable that some people will use force to subdue others. The best effect of hard work is the so-called 'people are forced to be shameless.' I want to study art, hoping to use aesthetic education to transform people and improve the spiritual civilization of the public, so as to achieve the realm of world harmony."</p>
<p>Sun Li, because his companions usually gave him the nickname "Little Merchant" based on his actions, was about to speak, but he was shy first. Unable to withstand the urging of the crowd, he honestly expressed:</p>
<p>"Everyone knows that my father is a businessman, and I also hope to inherit my father's business, but I want to work hard to develop it. The teacher said: 'If the country is rich, the people will be strong. Only when people are well-fed and clothed will they know etiquette.' To know the way to manage money is to study economics, right?"</p>
<p>The youngest Li Zhen straightened his clothes and spoke eloquently:</p>
<p>"Military force is omnipotent! Only military force can conquer everything! In this world of power, it is necessary to strengthen the army and consolidate the national defense line. I am very interested in military science and want to be a person who dominates the world!"</p>
<p>The decisive words came from a powerful mouth, and the thumbs could not help but be raised!</p>
<p>Although their thoughts are different, they are all patriotic little citizens. Old Li was very happy and earnestly encouraged them in their respective ambitions.</p>

<h3>A Chemical Toy</h3>
<p>— Wang Ziding</p>
<p>Electric Spark Branch</p>
<p>Dear children: The New Year is here, let's make some games that are helpful to learning and very interesting. Here I will tell you about a chemical toy.</p>
<p>The name of this chemical toy is "Electric Spark Branch". I think you children must be saying that you have never heard of it! But I can guarantee that you have all seen it. That is a copper wire with gray-salt-colored powder on the top. As long as you light it with a match, it will burn, and at the same time, it will emit many needle-like sparks (see picture) until the powder is burned out. Because the sparks are like needles, many people don't call it "Electric Spark Branch" but call it "Dot Dot Needle".</p>
<p>Children! Haven't you seen this before?</p>
<p>Going to a Guanghuo store to buy one will probably cost four or five coins, but if we make it ourselves, it won't cost that much. At the same time, making it ourselves is more interesting, and it is also somewhat helpful to learning.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about how to make it!</p>
<p>Applied chemicals - Weaving powder one part, sulfur flower one part, saltpeter five parts, magnesium powder three parts. (The total is less than two jiao.)</p>
<p>Other supplies - Glue, copper wire (or iron wire.)</p>
<p>First, grind the saltpeter and sulfur flower into a fine powder, then mix them with aluminum powder and magnesium powder. Add glue and mix with chopsticks. Then you can use a brush to moisten and apply it to the upper end of the copper wire. (Apply evenly.) After applying, put it in the sun to dry (see picture). In this way, an "Electric Spark Branch" is successfully made.</p>
<p>When the "Electric Spark Branch" catches fire and burns, we shouldn't be afraid of the sparks: these sparks are not dangerous. Touching them will not hurt your hand, and touching paper will not burn it, because they cannot last.</p>
<h3>The Number of Aircraft in the World's Major Powers</h3>
<p>— (Ning Ziqiang)</p>
<p>Children! Since everyone dedicated airplanes to celebrate birthdays, everyone's impression of the importance of airplanes is of course very deep. It is not only enriching national defense and resisting foreign insults, but also the only competitive weapon of various countries today! Now, I will report the number of aircraft in the world's major powers to you.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia 7,150 aircraft</p>
<p>France 5,200 aircraft</p>
<p>England 3,600 aircraft</p>
<p>United States 3,650 aircraft</p>
<p>Italy 2,800 aircraft</p>
<p>Germany 3,000 aircraft</p>
<p>Japan 1,900 aircraft</p>
<p>Looking at the air force equipment of the above countries, and looking back at our country, it is far from being able to reach it, it is precisely "a drop in the ocean".</p>
<h3>Quick Knife</h3>
<p>— Huai Liang</p>
<p>Prepare two bowls of the same height and size, a chopstick or other bamboo strip, its length should be two inches longer than the diameter of the two bowls. A kitchen knife.</p>
<p>When playing, put eight points of water in each of the two bowls, and arrange them side by side on a wooden board, the distance between the two bowls is about an inch, and put the chopsticks on the two bowls.</p>
<p>The most important thing to pay attention to is that the chopsticks should be placed in the center of the two bowls. The two ends of the chopsticks should be outside the edge of the bowl, if it is a little off, it will fail</p>
<p>If you, dear friends, cut the chopsticks with this knife, do you think the water in these two bowls will be affected? That's natural! Either the bowl is crushed, or the water splashes everywhere! That's not right, these two bowls and water are not affected, the bowl will not be crushed, and the water will not fly around.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, try it, raise the kitchen knife, and chop the center of the chopsticks with a "chop" sound. Only the chopsticks are divided into two sections, and the water in the bowl does not move. Children, isn't it very interesting?</p>
<h3>Blood</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One day, Min'er accidentally broke the skin on his hand, and bright red blood quickly flowed out, staining his left hand with bright red color.</p>
<p>"Quickly tie up his hand, so that the blood will not flow out again, it is better, "Ting'er said anxiously to him, and quickly went to get the hemostatic lotion.</p>
<p>They were busy for a while, and the blood on Min'er's left hand gradually stopped flowing out.</p>
<p>"Don't be too bold, this is not a game, blood is a very important thing, you can't let it flow out too much, flowing out too much is dangerous," Ting'er was not as playful as before, but solemnly explained to his young and ignorant brother.</p>
<p>"Brother, the blood on my hand has stopped, so it doesn't matter, look, what is this light yellow liquid."</p>
<p>"This light yellow liquid is secreted when the blood clots, so we know that blood is not a simple liquid, there are many solids in it, and those solids are blood cells, and the liquid is plasma, so in the blood, solids and liquids account for about half each.</p>
<p>"The blood cells you are talking about are white blood cells' blood cells?"</p>
<p>"You need to know that blood cells contain white blood cells and red blood cells. These white blood cells are used by our human body to resist the invasion of harmful bacteria from the outside. If they can't resist them, then people will get sick. But white blood cells are a strange thing, they can move freely, creeping along the walls of tiny tubes, they can pass through the walls of these capillaries, swim out of the tube, and engulf foreign germs, but their number is very small, about 500 red blood cells have one white blood cell. Red blood cells contain yellowish-red hemoglobin, and because of the difference in hemoglobin, there are now five major races in the world - red, yellow, white, brown, and black.</p>
<p>"Then what is the use of blood for the human body?"</p>
<p>"The importance of blood to the human body is like the people in a country. Blood circulates continuously in the human body, on the one hand, it transports the nutrients that have been made in the human bone marrow to all parts of the body, and on the other hand, it excretes the waste from the whole body. If the blood stops flowing, then the person will die. But the flow of blood depends entirely on the beating of the heart."</p>
<h3>Filial Piety (11)</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Empress Maria Feodorovna was a most kind and simple woman. She received Princess Tarakanova in her private chamber and listened very gently to her story. After hearing it, she repeatedly praised the old monk, promising to intercede with the Emperor on her behalf, and granted her three hundred rubles for her immediate needs. Tarakanova was incredibly grateful and speechless. Afterwards, when Madame Vivien asked her about her audience with the Empress, she was so happy that tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>Two days later, Empress Maria Feodorovna personally took her to see the Emperor and Empress Elizabeth. The Emperor and Empress were very moved by her story and treated her with great kindness. They even ordered a re-examination of her father's case. When she left, she received an additional five thousand rubles as a reward.</p>
<p>From the moment Princess Tarakanova entered the palace, those who had previously paid little attention to her immediately took notice. They all praised her beautiful face and remarked on her distinguished bearing, eagerly inviting her to their homes. However, Princess Tarakanova remained calm and showed no signs of being carried away. She never thought of her own comfort, nor was she proud of the favorable outcome. She simply retained her innocence and accepted people's kindness. One noble lady took her to see many magnificent halls in the palace. When they pointed out the Emperor's throne to her, she suddenly stopped and exclaimed in surprise, "Is that really the throne? When I thought of it in Siberia, I was so afraid!" In that instant, all her past hopes and disappointments, worries and fears, seemed to flood her heart like a tide. She raised her hands and cried out, "What a throne for an Emperor!" She was so excited that she almost fainted. Then, she asked for permission to approach it, knelt down, kissed the steps before the throne, and cried out to the sky: "Father! Father! Look, the authority of God has led me to this place! My God, bless this throne—bless the holy Son of Heaven who sits upon it—grant him infinite joy, just as he has made me happy!" At that moment, the two noble ladies could barely get her to leave the throne. She remained kneeling there, refusing to move. But because she was so overcome with emotion, she was exhausted and could no longer continue the tour.</p>

<h3>The Esperanto Movement in China Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Ganglin</p>
<p>1936 was a year of suffering. The national enemy's invasion of China reached its most severe stage, and the tide of the national salvation movement surged everywhere in the country. In such an environment, what progress has the Esperanto movement made?</p>
<p>First, Esperanto has been applied to the national salvation movement. In the past, most people who learned Esperanto used it as a tool for their own knowledge or enjoyment. It seemed that learning Esperanto would allow them to read many more books and achieve their goal of seeking knowledge, or they could use Esperanto to engage in international correspondence, make many foreign friends, and exchange books, newspapers, pictures, stamps, and so on, to satisfy their desires for hobbies and interests. But this year, domestic Esperantists rarely displayed such ambitions based on individualism. In Peiping, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, large groups of Esperantists used Esperanto to participate in the national salvation movement. Under the slogan "Use Esperanto for the freedom and liberation of China," they organized international correspondence groups and published correspondence publications, such as Peiping's "Radio" and Shanghai's "China Roars!" (Cinjo Hurias), which made great efforts this year to report the current situation in China to international people. In particular, the latter was able to frankly and objectively report the suffering situation in China to the international people as much as possible, which has won them a lot of praise. At the same time, Esperantists from various places have also translated many foreign communications and published them in domestic publications, such as the civil war in Spain, which provided domestic publications with a lot of valuable materials. These all confirmed the great significance of the Esperanto movement in the national liberation movement, and that modern Esperantists have indeed shouldered the task of using Esperanto to participate in the national salvation movement.</p>
<p>Second, the universal expansion of the movement. We cannot deny that in many places, such as Kunming, Changsha, Fuzhou, Guiyang, etc., the Esperanto movement was quite silent this year. But in other places such as Peiping, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuchang, Hangzhou, Nanning, Tianjin, Hong Kong, etc., there has been great new progress, and a large number of new Esperantists have emerged. In other inland counties, there were also more individual learners than in previous years, which can be indirectly proved by the large number of elementary textbooks, dictionaries, etc. sold in various places by Shanghai.</p>
<p>Third, the deepening of social understanding of Esperanto. The Esperanto movement has a history of thirty years in China, but it has not been noticed by people. In recent years, due to the tireless efforts of the workers of the Esperanto movement, such as the progress of publicity methods, and the regular publication of Esperanto translations in various publications, the social understanding of Esperanto has deepened day by day. In the past, there were often some people with prejudices who came out to obstruct or even destroy the Esperanto movement, but this phenomenon did not occur this year. At the same time, the government also understood the essence of the Esperanto movement and confirmed that the Esperanto movement has a considerable contribution to the national resistance movement. Therefore, many groups have been approved for registration by the authorities; for example, in Guangzhou, Nanning, and Taiyuan, the Esperanto movement has been given considerable and generous support by the authorities, and has been given many conveniences in its work.</p>
<p>Fourth, the active Esperanto publishing industry. This year, the Esperanto publishing industry has unprecedented harvests in quantity. The most important books, in Shanghai alone, have been published as "International Esperanto Communication Collection," "Elementary Lecture Textbook," "Emerging Language Theory," "New Theory of Esperanto," "Esperanto Translation Research," "Esperanto Grammar Rhetoric Lecture," "How I Learned," "Voice of the World," "Fifty Years of Esperanto" and many other types; and other places such as Guangzhou have also published several types. Publications such as Shanghai's "The World" have been published for four years, and have been improved in form and content this year. Shanghai's "China Roars" has also been changed to letterpress. In addition to "Light of Esperanto" and "Radio" in Peiping, there is a new publication called "Aurora Star." Guangzhou has two new publications, "Hell" and "Storm." Hangzhou has "Oasis" and Hong Kong has "New Culture", both of which are published as supplements to the local newspapers. The activity of this kind of publication reflects how rapid the progress of the Esperanto movement in China has been this year.</p>
<p>1937 is the 50th anniversary of the birth of Esperanto. What work will the more than 20,000 Esperantists across the country do this year? What kind of development will the Chinese Esperanto movement have this year? I think this is a matter worthy of attention by the cultural circles in the future.</p>
<h3>China's Urgent Task Today</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>China's history in the past century is a history of transition from feudalism to capitalism. But the world in the past century has begun a transition from capitalism to socialism. Because the world is China's environment, the transition from capitalism to socialism must act on China's transition from feudalism to capitalism. This is an unavoidable thing.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the greatest of these effects was from the "May Fourth" to "1927" stage. It made our eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought abruptly encounter nineteenth-century social thought, and made our February Revolution-style national revolution have the possibility of abruptly transitioning to the October Revolution-style social revolution. At that time, there were two futures for China: capitalism and non-capitalism. But the resolution of this contradiction moved China's revolutionary direction to the side of capitalism.</p>
<p>Once history embarks on a certain stage, it cannot be changed according to our subjective wishes. It must go through a considerable period of time before it can reach the side of its own opposition. Only then can we change its direction and make it embark on a new stage. Therefore, although human power can promote history, it can only promote it, and there is an indispensable natural growth.</p>
<p>And the transition from capitalism to socialism in the world? There was a climax in the "May Fourth" era, so it stimulated our Enlightenment movement and thereby stimulated our national revolution. But after "1927", the climax has long passed. The new climax has not yet arrived. This is simply a receding era, a low tide era. Therefore, the influence of the world's transition from capitalism to socialism on China is very small. It can be said to be equal to zero.</p>
<p>Under these two circumstances, the attempt to disobey the historical decision of "1927" to move China towards capitalism and to reverse China's transition from feudalism to capitalism so that it becomes a transition from capitalism to socialism in order to leap over the capital stage, failed. Artificially brewed climaxes are just fantasies to comfort oneself. All movements, whether it is the Red Army or the Soviets, are nothing more than an unpromising peasant movement. China's history is still in the transition from feudalism to capitalism.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot but give a new examination and a new analysis to the history before and after "1927" until now. In this way, we feel that China's history from the Opium War to the present is still in the stage of transition from feudalism to capitalism. The possibility of the transition from capitalism to socialism in "1927" was only a reaction caused by the stimulation of China by the climax of the world's transition from capitalism to socialism, and can only be a flash in the pan. And today when it cannot give China stimulation, China's history must follow its own direction.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to explain a few words about the general process of transition from feudalism to capitalism. This process is completed with a revolution. The revolution in the transition from feudalism to capitalism is the movement of the capitalist citizens against the feudal aristocracy. It is usually called the democratic revolution, that is, the anti-feudal civic revolution. This kind of civic revolution has three characteristics: "for democracy, that is, opposing aristocratic politics and establishing democratic politics, which can be represented by the revolutions of England and France;" for the nation, that is, opposing feudal countries and establishing national countries, which can be represented by the independence of the Netherlands and the United States; and for unity, that is, opposing separatist forces and establishing a unified regime, which can be represented by the unification movement of Germany and Italy. Any civic revolution must have these three characteristics in order to complete its democratic, national and unified tasks. Because in this way, history can pass from feudalism to capitalism. The aforementioned civic revolutions of the six countries of England, France, the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and Italy are only in terms of their special development in a certain aspect under their respective historical conditions.</p>
<p>China's history, in the current stage, is in the transition from feudalism to capitalism, then there can be no exception. That is to say, it must make a civic revolution, and develop</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>the three aspects of this revolution to complete its democratic, national and unified tasks. In this way, it can pass from feudalism to capitalism, and complete the historical development of the current stage.</p>
<p>According to this view, the civic revolution is a general process of change in the current stage of history. Then, the democratic nature of this revolution as expressed by the Xinhai Revolution, has it not overthrown the Manchu aristocracy and established a democratic republic? The national nature of this revolution as expressed by the National Revolution of 1927, has it not loudly called for the overthrow of imperialism, and taken the warlords as the tools of imperialism, and established a national government that can be translated as a national government? The unified nature of this revolution as expressed by the unification war since 1928, has it not used the slogan of unification to overthrow the separatist forces in order to establish and consolidate a unified central government? These three characteristics have unfolded into three periods in China, becoming the three tasks of China's civic revolution.</p>
<p>Why can't they be completed all at once in China? In other words, why are they divided into three periods? This can be explained by China's special situation. What should be paid attention to here is that it is not enough for China to complete only one of the three tasks of the civic revolution. If one revolution only completes one, then another revolution must be made to complete the others. The facts show this very clearly.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that the Xinhai Revolution did not complete democratic politics, and the National Revolution did not complete the national movement. Your analysis is incorrect. Then, please note: The failure of the Xinhai Revolution to complete democratic politics was because it did not complete unification at that time: The failure of the National Revolution to complete the national movement was also because it did not complete unification at that time; therefore, unification has a key effect on democracy and the nation.</p>
<p>Without unification, there will be separatist forces. Separatist forces are feudal and incompatible with democracy. In the past, everyone advocated provincial constitutions, thinking that with constitutions in each province, it would be better. But in fact, even if provincial constitutions existed, they could not be implemented. At that time, everyone advocated federalism for China, thinking that this could eliminate separatism and civil war. But in fact, it was completely impossible. Therefore, the national constitution is the same as the provincial constitution, all because separatist forces exist and cannot be put into effect. This shows that democracy is a political form of a unified country. There is no democracy without unification.</p>
<p>The success of the national movement also depends on unification. The fact that Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century were able to become independent and autonomous countries came from their unification movement. It is completely national suicide to have foreign troubles and internal separatist wars. Today, when a certain imperialism is using a divisive policy to gradually carve up China, the method of dealing with it is the unification movement. Otherwise, if we are the clam and the oyster, and the enemy is the fisherman, there will be no country that will not perish. This has been said bitterly in Moscow's Pravda and New Dawn Daily. Therefore, if we do not say resistance to the enemy to save the country, then if we say resistance to the enemy to save the country, we must complete unification. This is a self-evident and unchangeable principle.</p>
<p>Then, the unification that the third period of China's civic revolution is engaged in is very important. It is not only the urgent task at present, but also the urgent task of completing the revolutions of the first two periods. This is a necessary logic.</p>
<p>Anyone who defines the Chinese revolution in the current stage as a civic revolution ("second-property-class-nature-of-the-people's-rights-revolution") cannot oppose unification. And they should actively demand unification and complete unification. Recognizing unification as the work of China's civic revolution, as the necessary process for China to pass from feudalism to capitalism, as the key to China's completion of democratic politics internally and the national movement externally in the present, can not only make us understand the history of the past 25 years, especially the history of the past 9 years, but also make us understand our work in the current stage. This is a very important thing.</p>
<h3>The National Academy of Music and Dance in Paris</h3>
<p>— Junming</p>
<p>Paris, this "capital of art and literature," this famous "city of flowers," has so much to see and do that it is impossible to describe it all. But everyone knows about the Palace of Versailles, the museums, and the Arc de Triomphe, so there is no need to go into detail here. In addition to these, there is another place in Paris, no, even in Europe, that is very famous and that few people ever talk about specifically: this place is the famous music and dance theater—"The National Academy of Music and Dance."</p>
<p>The "National Academy of Music and Dance" in Paris is one of the national theaters of France, located in the center of Paris. The grand and beautiful building that we see now was not built in recent years: in fact, it has quite a history. It is said that as far back as half a century ago, in 1861, an architect named Charles Garnier began to build this music and dance theater, and it was largely completed at the end of 1874, and the opening ceremony was held on January 5, 1875. The cost of the project was 36.5 million francs, and the cost of purchasing the land was 10.5 million francs, for a total of nearly 50 million francs. However, before that, it went through eleven changes of location, lasting about two hundred years, before it was fixed in its current location; at the same time, the name of the theater also went through nine changes during that long period. In this way, the magnificence of the theater's construction, its position and value among general theaters, can be imagined.</p>
<p>Indeed, the architecture of the "National Academy of Music and Dance" itself is a work of art. Standing on the streets of Paris, just looking at its exterior is already quite impressive; if you go inside, you will be even more amazed by the greatness of its design and the luxury of its arrangement. Its stage is 14 meters high, 54 meters wide, and 26 meters deep; it is really not an exaggeration to say that it is the "world's top stage." A huge fireproof iron gate is set up between the audience seats and the stage, which is very safe. The dancers' rooms are separate: generally, first-class singers and dancers have one room per person; most of the other members of the choir or temporary personnel share a room, but men and women are separated; second-class and below singers and dancers have two, three, up to seven or eight people per room. There are also various offices for the theater staff, a library, and a museum.</p>
<p>This music and dance theater has a total of 1,200 audience seats. It employs about 1,200 people, from the general manager to the gatekeepers, firefighters, and workers, including about 60 professional singers, a choir of about 100 people, about 200 dancers, and an orchestra of about 160 people, for a total of about 500 people in the art department.</p>
<p>There are no definite regulations for the appointment of professional singers here. It is entirely up to the general manager to recruit them. So in reality, although many of these singers are highly praised, they are not necessarily all first-class artists. However, the music and dance of this music and dance theater in Paris is very famous, and almost everyone engaged in music and dance wants to come here to find a way out; as long as there is a shortage of personnel in the choir here, the number of applicants is often more than seven or eight times the number of vacancies.</p>
<p>Personnel who come here to apply must pass two tests before they can be admitted as members; at the same time, in the first year, new members must not only have the obligation to perform in 194 performances, but also receive training in the theater for three afternoons a week. In addition, male and female students of the official music school are required to study at public expense, so if this national theater requires them to perform temporarily while they are studying, they cannot refuse. As for the general choir members, most of them have part-time jobs.</p>
<p>The "National Academy of Music and Dance" in Paris also has an affiliated music and dance school. The students here, aged eight to nine, must also receive elementary compulsory education; the time for specialized dance training is five years for the elementary level; three years for the first grade, and two years for the second grade. These students must hold one to three competitive examinations each year. After passing the examination, they are incorporated into the theater's music and dance troupe. The so-called "little mice of Coterse" are students of this music and dance school. As for the status and level of all music and dance men and women, that is the same as in other places, and the highest is something like "star" or "queen."</p>
<p>There are eight kinds of tickets for the theater: the lowest is 3 francs per ticket, and the highest is 61 francs per ticket. But on the International Day of July 14th every year, it is open to the general public for one day, and tickets are not sold.</p>
<p>The French government issues a subsidy of 2.4 million francs to this national theater every year, and a special person is entrusted to manage it. This person is the general manager of the theater, and of course also a government official. His term of office is seven years, and during these seven years, in addition to the originally performed programs, he must add 17 new programs, of which 14 must be the works of French composers; at the same time, the theater must have 190 ticketed performances within one year.</p>
<p>In addition to these general performances, the largest dance party in Europe to help sick and weak children—the "White Bed Dance Party"—and the dance party of the Paris fashion merchants are held every year in January in this "National Academy of Music and Dance"; and the grand occasion of these two special dance parties is of course not comparable to ordinary dance parties at ordinary times.</p>
<p>However, what most people do not know is the mysterious basement of this theater. What is particularly interesting here is the "sound storage room." In detail, in a corner of this dark basement, you can see a tightly closed iron door. Inside the door are boxes containing several lead boxes. In these lead boxes are the voices and works of world musicians who have appeared on the stage of this theater since this century; these are all made into records and placed in those lead boxes, so the place where these lead boxes are placed is called the "sound storage room."</p>
<p>This "sound storage room" was proposed to the theater by the French Gramophone Company in 1907, and at that time the company produced many records and sent them to the theater; later it was increased three or four times. But the sender made a condition when sending the records, that is, they must be opened after a hundred years, and then it was shortened to fifty years; now fifty years have not passed, so this "sound storage room" is still a secret, and the records in it are still tightly closed in lead boxes; it will be up to the Minister of Education to decide the opening date and implement the opening after fifty years; at that time, people will probably rush to listen to the voices of many famous musicians, and the grand occasion is really difficult for us to imagine now.</p>
<h3>The Temporality of Dance</h3>
<p>— South Wind</p>
<p>The art of dance, like other artistic disciplines, must have its value supported by its temporality and practicality. The history and progress of the art of dance are also, both visibly and invisibly, governed by this temporal practicality. At the same time, because the art of dance is a natural expression and manifestation of the life of the times, it possesses a sharp sensitivity to the era, and can be said to be a vivid experience of real life.</p>
<p>The dance of each era possesses a unique "style" of that era. During periods of historical or cultural transition, people not only undergo development and transformation in their spiritual aspects, but also experience changes in their physical and even psychological makeup. The complex relationships between people in this period, labor, and daily habits all create the unique temperament and posture of this era, forming unique dynamic rhythms and rules of emotional movement.</p>
<p>The frenzied "Carmagnole" dance, a song and dance that emerged during the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, the "Polka" dance, which expressed the joy of the conservative restoration in the mid-19th century, and the solemn and elegant "Menuet" dance, which originated in the 18th century, each of these eras' images is imprinted on all ballroom dances and folk dances. Even the exaggerated "Waltz" dance of modern times, the gorgeous "Tango" dance, the decadent "Blues" dance, and the agile "Foxtrot" dance are also products of the romantic life of modern backward populations.</p>
<p>These dances can be said to be milestones in the historical lives of European and American nations. They certainly left us with many dance techniques; however, if these techniques are not reorganized and refined, and their external forms are retained and accepted, then the stage movement of these dances will undoubtedly feel discordant and isolated from the life movement of people living in this era. At the same time, it can also affect the progress of dance itself.</p>
<p>In Soviet dance art, like other artistic disciplines, a major purge and reform was carried out. The labor relations and daily life in the transformed Soviet Union have undergone a major change, and at the same time, Soviet dance art has followed the laws of this life, showing significant reforms and progress.</p>
<p>Initially, several geniuses of dance art emerged in the Soviet Union. However, because they were deeply influenced by classical dance, although they tried their best to bring dance closer to real life, they often inevitably made the new dance forms they created merely products of pure intellectual ideals and keen imagination, and could not truly penetrate into real life. As a result, they could not escape the shallow circle of aestheticism. For example, Goreytsaov's ballet "Temp • Tu • Kolombian", "Tragedy of the Mask", "Salome", and "The Revolt" can be said to fully demonstrate the incorrect points of Goreytsaov's artistic thinking.</p>
<p>The dances expressed in these plays do have astonishing progress and a spirit that breaks through outdated old forms, creating the initial stage of the progress of Soviet dance art today. However, some of the new dance forms he expressed in the two plays "The Revolt" and "Salome" are somewhat similar to mechanical exercises, especially the dance on high ladders in "The Revolt". He wanted to capture the techniques of "lightness" to create clear and sharp lines as an artistic expression of "force", in order to suit the powerful life at the time. However, this "force" line expressed by the body using lightness is often saturated with sexuality, and often falls into undisguised ugly erotic movements. And only in these erotic movements can one discover the "force" art that Goreytsaov wanted to express in his dance. The reason why Goreytsaov's creations are like this is entirely because the new dance form of mechanics art that he wanted to express was created by the old dance experience accumulated over a long period of time and the uncritical absorption of the techniques of old-style dance. His art stands outside of real life, and the new dance form he created is nothing more than an ideal object in his brain, and cannot be in line with the actual life movement at that time.</p>
<p>Lukin, who was equally famous as Goreytsaov and confined to classical music, was also ridiculed by general moralists at the time as an "Apia-Man's spasm" and a "sexuality expresser", but his acute-angled, distinct, and static expression method was praised for a time.</p>
<p>Today's Soviet Union has created new rules of life, and it can be said that it has formulated concrete norms in all aspects. The new dance form is not simply a pile of old dance techniques, but is created by adapting and modifying them.</p>
<p>The dance programs in the recently produced musical dramas and film dramas all show the success of the new dance at this stage. In dances where we only see people wearing athletic shorts similar to nudity, we do not see any erotic feelings, but only the expression of strength and health. Sometimes, in jazz rhythms and tap dances, there is no empty, hedonistic Grotesque feeling, but rather the expression of a regular, scientific collective life. And it also uses bugles and cannons to accompany the melody of the dance music.</p>
<p>Modern dance art, apart from the Soviet Union, we do not see any symbols of progress. Some only focus on the development of formal aspects, and create a lonely character for the dance. It can be said that it is contradictory and incompatible with real life. Since dance has lost its temporality, it cannot have progressive development.</p>
<p>We Chinese are even more blindly accepting some classical and some European and American dances that are for the purpose of enjoyment. For our nation that has suffered so much, it is absolutely incompatible and poisonous to our real life.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage to Ancient Italian City</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jia Yin</p>
<p>Ever since reading Madame de Staël's "Pompeii," I have been fascinated by this ancient city from two thousand years ago. I never thought I would actually be able to visit it in this lifetime. Imagine my joy and satisfaction.</p>
<p>It was eight o'clock in the morning when we landed in Naples. The Italian sky is always clear and bright, so Naples was bathed in warm sunlight. Everyone was wearing very light and graceful clothing. After we landed, attendants from various travel agencies came to greet us. They could speak French, English, or German, so there was no communication barrier with the travelers. We chose to take a tour bus from the Flying Eagle Travel Agency. This bus was similar to a public bus in Shanghai, except there was no ticket purchasing or checking process, as we had rented it entirely. The bus traveled along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Looking out from the bus window, on one side was the endless sea, with white waves swirling like water chestnuts greeting the wind, lifting one by one, and on the other side was a dense and lush grove of sorghum, swaying in the breeze like the sound of birds. Further away, standing in the distance, was a massive volcano, its mouth emitting thick smoke, appearing sulfur-colored in the sunlight. The bus sped along like lightning for more than two hours before reaching the foot of the volcano. Next to the foot of the mountain was the ancient city of Pompeii, which we had come to visit specifically. At the city gate, there was a large coffee shop and a museum. The coffee shop was for tourists to rest and quench their thirst. The food was very clean, but very expensive. The museum was opposite the coffee shop. The museum was divided into two parts: one part was dedicated to displaying the utensils excavated from the city, and the other part displayed the dead people and other animals excavated from the city. In the middle of the two parts was the main road leading into the ancient city. In order to first draw an outline of the culture of this ancient city, we first went to visit the museum. To anyone who boasts that modern material civilization far surpasses that of the past, please come here and take a look! This museum has already shown us that a thousand years ago, we already had our chemical, physical, and other gadgets of today. The unburned bottles, jars, bowls, pots, scales, weights, and all other instruments are no simpler or cruder than those used in our laboratories today. In addition, the whole box of silk and the whole case of jewelry, in their exquisiteness, can be said to far surpass what we have now. Unfortunately, after being excavated, they have all turned to ash and can only be displayed in glass cabinets for us to see. As for the dead people displayed at the end, they were probably the owners or distinguished guests of wealthy families on that day. Perhaps they were in the midst of colorful and dazzling revelry when they suddenly encountered this great calamity and were buried alive in the volcanic solution. Therefore, the women still had beads and bracelets on their wrists and gems on their ears, and the men still had diamond rings on their fingers, but they were all hunched over, with their backs bent and their teeth slightly exposed, showing the unbearable suffering they experienced at the time. As for the other animals, such as dogs and horses, they were also burned by the fire and were bent and twisted. These animals did not rot due to the high heat and have all become fossils.</p>
<p>After visiting the museum, we were led by an old man of about sixty years of age to visit this great ancient city. According to this old man, this city was destroyed by the volcano next to it. It is only that now, due to geological changes, the active volcano has become a dead volcano and no longer harms people. The Italian government has also found experts to carefully excavate this ancient city, and the part that has been excavated so far is already quite considerable.</p>
<p>We followed the old man among the broken steles and remnant pillars for a full three hours. What can be seen in its entirety is the grand theater. The roof of the theater has naturally long been burned down, but the seats and stage are still intact as before. These are all built of stone, very neat and careful. After careful calculation, it can accommodate two or three thousand people. The next is the bathhouse. It is said that in those days, the nature of the bathhouse was similar to that of a coffee shop today. Finding friends, chatting idly, and discussing all kinds of matters all took place in the bathhouse. This bathhouse was indeed an entertainment venue, so attention was paid to the architectural equipment to attract customers. What can still be seen now is the bathtub as large as a room. In fact, it can also be said to be a bathing pool, because it is built into the ground with marble, and water is also input through tap water pipes. In front of the bathing pool is a large hall, with patterns and flower tiles laid on the floor, dazzling with colors. It is said that this is a place where everyone dances after bathing while their muscles are excited. This kind of situation seems unimaginable to Chinese people who have been subjected to "etiquette", but many famous Western paintings have taken their material from here. In addition to these two public places that are still relatively intact, the next is a brothel. The roof of this brothel has been carefully designed and rebuilt by excavation experts, because it is said that this brothel can represent the entire culture of this ancient city two thousand years ago. This brothel forms a courtyard, in the middle of which is a large patio, surrounded by small rooms, each with different wall paintings, floor tile patterns, and colors. One room has walls with the upper half peach red and the lower half black, but between the upper and lower halves is a half-foot wide strip of scallion green, with various postures of Cupid painted on it. Walking into the room, the dazzling colors simply make people's hearts flutter and their minds wander! In another room, a large angel is painted on the wall, with a scale in the angel's hand. One end of the scale is fame and fortune, and the other end is a man's genitals. Everyone, think about which end is heavier? And in this painting, the end of fame and fortune is held high! This is the creed of everyone in this ancient city a thousand years ago! The philosophy of everyone! Therefore, the Bible records that the destruction of this ancient city was due to excessive licentiousness and was punished by God. However, they used this licentiousness as a starting point and created the ancient civilization of the Roman Empire that dominated for a time!</p>
<p>In this ancient city, in addition to these two or three places that are relatively complete and can give a glimpse of the whole picture, the rest are only broken pillars and ruined walls. They belonged to polytheism at that time, so incomplete marble altars are everywhere, and the forms and carvings of these altars are no less than the best works of art today. Everyone may be very surprised that at that time, the entire city already had tap water facilities. After being buried by the volcano, many were naturally destroyed, but they have now been reorganized and repaired by the excavators. This tap water can not only be used by every family in the city, but also provides water for passers-by to quench their thirst. Therefore, there is a semicircular stone well railing at the corner of every street, and on one side of the railing are children in various postures, and water is sent out by these children, either from the mouth, or from the bottle held in the hand, or from the beak of the bird clipped under the arm, or the child's urine flows out. There is naturally a hole in the middle of the railing, which can output water that has been splashed out. Whose brain can say that the ingenious conception is not as good as that of today's people?</p>
<p>What they didn't have at that time was probably only airplanes, cars, trams, etc. The streets in this city are paved with gravel, similar to the roads in the Ximen area of Shanghai. Although they are neat, they are not as smooth as asphalt roads. The streets are also not wide, usually only about five feet wide, except for the one leading to the Temple of Aphrodite, which is about ten feet wide. Their means of transportation at that time were sedan chairs and carriages. There is still a small house for placing this type of transportation that has not been destroyed. The floor of that small house is inlaid with colored tiles in the shape of the sedan chairs or carriages they sat in. It is truly magnificent!</p>
<p>We walked in this city for three hours, and because there was no shelter above our heads, we were a little dizzy from being exposed to the Italian sun. We hurriedly turned around and came out to rest in the coffee shop. There was also a music team in the coffee shop, with about five or six people in the team, including violins, cellos, guitars, etc., and a singer. They were all wearing tailcoats, white bow ties, slicked hair, and powdered faces, and were well-mannered. However, after singing a song, the singer held a tall, towering top hat and came to each guest to ask for coins! - Who knew that the people of a country that had such a magnificent civilization in ancient times and now has such a strong military force would have such a living situation! Filled with endless questions, I followed my companions back to the ship.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Mysterious Life</h3>
<p>— Seeking Truth</p>
<p>Humans and all animals are sentient beings, even capable of speech and thought, completely different from all inanimate objects such as minerals. But where does the difference lie? According to the research of physics and chemistry, whether it is a living thing, an inanimate thing, a plant or an animal among living things, the chemical basis of their composition is nothing more than certain elements, and more fundamentally, they are all composed of atoms and electrons. Then why do objects composed of the same amount of atoms and electrons have some that can feel or think, and some that cannot feel or think? That is, why do some have life and some do not have life? Furthermore, what exactly is life? Where does it reside? Where does it come from? To study biology, this is indeed the most important question.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the question of the origin of life has sparked countless debates, and it is still the same today. Because the solution to general world view issues and philosophical issues is inextricably linked to this one question.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, all living things were created by the Creator alone. Life is not a product of historical development,</p>
<p>Continued on Page 5</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>but a creation of an omnipotent God. All living things possess the "spirit" created by God Himself. However, scientific progress has proven the absurdity of this claim. According to science, life not only has its own history, but life itself is also a product of the natural development of inanimate objects.</p>
<p>Modern scientific research on the origin of life has several opinions, the main ones being "spontaneous generation" and "the perpetuity of life." In addition, there are many claims that can be attached to these two items.</p>
<p>So-called spontaneous generation believes that life is generated by the special combination of inorganic particles, and at the same time, its combination is produced by a favorable environment. However, the spontaneous generation of life was proven to be impossible by French scholar Pasteur in 1860. At that time, it was already known that the decay of organic matter was caused by special microorganisms - bacteria. Dead animals and plants undergo destructive effects after a certain period of time, in which putrefactive bacteria appear. Pasteur proved that microorganisms may fall from the air, which usually contains a large number of cells, into the gradually decaying remains of animals and plants. He did an experiment. He took two jars filled with boiling meat broth, opened one and sealed one. In the open one, the development of bacteria could be seen quickly. No bacteria appeared in the sealed one. This proves that living things cannot be spontaneously generated from decaying matter. Pasteur's experiment overturned that unscientific assumption. Only medieval scholars would assert that highly organized animals can now be generated from matter in the microbial world. The emergence of life requires a very complex and long process, and it is by no means possible to succeed overnight. As Engels said, "To use a small amount of water and hope that nature will do in twenty-four hours what nature necessarily needs thousands of years to do is probably futile and unreasonable."</p>
<p>Next is the perpetuity of life. It believes that life is eternally sustained; organisms in the form of tiny organisms are filled throughout the universe, and there is no need to explore from what other substances they emerge and their roots. Life, like matter, existed from the beginning. Life is based on indestructible organic particles. Given a suitable environment, it will continue to survive forever. Proponents of this claim—the "particle theory" or "atomic theory"—are Rieter von Hohenlindern in 1870 and later Arrhenius. But is this statement about life correct? Does it not contradict the fundamental laws of nature? As far as we know, both the living and inanimate worlds are in a constant process of development. Nebulae transform into stars and planets. When a planet reaches a certain state, life is found on it. Life also follows its own cycle, experiencing a long history of self-development. If it is said that life existed from the beginning, then it is fundamentally inconsistent with the law of cosmic evolution, so the perpetuity of life is unscientific.</p>
<p>There is also a group of "vitalists" who believe that life cannot be generated from inanimate natural objects. Each organism has a special "vital force," and all life phenomena depend on it. This vital force is similar to the "spirit" created by the celestial God in the Bible. But chemical research has shattered this claim. Because the most basic substance that constitutes life, protein, has now reached the point where it can be manufactured artificially. And can that vital force, which is attributed to the basis of life, exist apart from tangible matter? If as long as it is a substance, it can have vitality, then all substances, such as minerals and plants, should have life. So this statement is also unscientific.</p>
<p>Originally, life and protein are inextricably linked. The organisms that live on the earth today are fundamentally composed of proteins. Therefore, to solve the problem of the origin of life, one must understand under what conditions protein can appear. Protein can only exist at a certain temperature, and it will solidify if it exceeds eighty to one hundred degrees. The protein of cells is a colloidal solution, and the liquid can only exist below one hundred degrees. Therefore, the occurrence of life must be when the earth cools to below one hundred degrees. According to paleontological research, aquatic animals existed before terrestrial animals, so the ocean is the cradle of life. The predecessor of life depends on organic compounds. The reason why living things are different from inanimate things is that the former has the effect of metabolism, while the latter does not. Organic compounds can use light to produce metabolism. So life originated from organic compounds. Organic matter is the source of very highly colloidal solutions. Under certain conditions, the colloid turns into a solidified mass, which is "gel". And "gel" is the beginning of biological construction. In short, life is the property of matter that is specially and highly organized. Life is the result of the development of inanimate natural objects. It is the result of natural evolution, not a sudden occurrence, as "spontaneous generation" says; nor does it coexist with the earth and the universe, as "the perpetuity of life" says; nor is there a so-called "vital force" apart from matter, as "vitalism" says.</p>
<p>The earliest form of life is "protoplasm", which is the so-called "basis of life form". The next is the cell. Initially, it was a single, low-level protoplasm, which was only a colloidal liquid with sensitivity and reflectivity, and later evolved into a cell. But the organization of the cell is very complex, with a nucleus in the center and a cell membrane outside. Simple lower primitive organisms are single-celled, with only one cell, and they can also metabolize and live independently. But general organisms are multicellular. The production of cells takes the form of division, and there is always the death of old cells and the production of new cells. In this way, the life of an adult organism can continue.</p>
<p>From the above, life has its material basis and comes from evolution, and is by no means endowed by the Creator. Since life is the property of highly organized matter, then if the matter that possesses this property is destroyed or dies, then life will also be reduced or die. If all the cells in a person's body die, then life will be gone. What "immortal soul", what "heaven", what "God" is all unreliable. Life has its occurrence, development, and death. And only in this way can there be evolution.</p>

<h3>A Certain Person's Confession (5)</h3>
<p>— Original by French writer André Gide, translated by Xiang Shi</p>
<p>With what fervent love she cared for me after we left Sousse; with what meticulous attention, protection, help, and care... was I surrounded! From Sousse to Tunis, and from Tunis to Constantine, Marcelle was truly admirable. Only when I arrived in Biskra did I begin to recover. Her faith was unwavering; her enthusiasm never waned for a moment. She planned everything, arranged the itinerary, and decided on our lodging. Alas, she could not make the journey any easier. Many times, I had to stop, thinking my life was about to end. I was drenched in sweat, like a dying man, gasping for air, and occasionally fainting. By the afternoon of the third day, upon reaching Biskra, I was practically a dead man.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Why bring up the past? What is there to commemorate? Yet, unpleasant memories constantly flood back. At that time, I no longer knew who I was or where I was. I only remember lying very weakly in bed, with Marcelle, my wife, my life, leaning over the bedside watching me. I knew it was her ardent care and deep love that revived me. Like a sailor who has lost his boat at sea and finally sees land, I felt a glimmer of life ignite; I was able to smile at Marcelle—why recount all this? Because then the black wings of death had touched me, and yet I lived; this was truly unexpected light and hope for me. Before, I truly did not know I was living. So now I regard life as an astonishing discovery.</p>
<p>The day came when I was able to get out of bed. Our lodging tempted me to take a look. It was actually just a rooftop platform. Yet what a wonderful platform it was! My and Marcelle's rooms were both on it: towering above the neighbors' roofs. When we stood at that highest point, we saw many houses, above them palm trees, and above the palm trees, the vast sky. The other side of the platform adjoined the municipal park; wisteria vines completely covered it; below the platform was a courtyard, a very small and tidy courtyard, in the center of which were planted six palm trees. My room was large, with plenty of air, the walls were plastered with whitewash, with no decorations hanging; a small door led to Marcelle's room, and another glass door led out to the platform.</p>
<p>How many uncounted hours flowed by here! I don't know how many times, in my solitude, I remembered these leisurely scenes—Marcelle beside me, reading, sewing, or writing. I did nothing, I only gazed at her. Oh, Marcelle! Marcelle! I looked, I looked at the sun, I looked at the shadows, I looked at the lines of the shadows slowly moving, I thought very little, saw a lot. I was still very weak; breathing was difficult; everything tired me, even reading; besides, what else did I need to read, all this was enough to overwhelm me. (To be continued)</p>
