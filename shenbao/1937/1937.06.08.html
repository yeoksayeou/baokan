<p>時評</p>
<h3>德外長訪問南歐的意義</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>德國自從干涉西班牙的內戰受到極大的打擊後其對外政策就有相當的轉變。它知道一味對外蠻幹。非但要受到被侵略國的堅决抵抗。而且還要引起各國的反感。同時它也深切感覺到向外蠻幹的實國還沒有準備充足。尤其可慮的是製造軍火的原料非常缺乏因此它的外交政策近已暫時放棄蠻幹的方法。而轉取溫和的手叚。以謀改進對外的關係。充足其向外發展的實力。在這種情形下。英德親善的老調重彈起來。德意關係則有進一步的發展這次德外長的訪問南歐諸國也是值得注意的。</p>
<p>牛賴特這次南歐之行。為期約有一星期之久。所訪問的國家有南斯拉夫保加里亞與匈牙利等國。他所負的使命。除在政治上推進納粹勢力外。並在經濟上樹立合作的基礎。使德國所需要的原料。能在這些國家內獲得充分的供給。種重要使命。能否獲得成功。請就當今的情勢。來探究一番。</p>
<p>先就德南關係說。德國早在南國奠下親善的基礎。在經濟方面。沙赫特的魔手已使南國落入德國的經濟圈套。它利用德國欠南國巨額貨欵。（在一九三五年德欠南國貨欵達三百萬鎊之巨。）强迫南國購買大批的德货。並在商業上獲取南國優惠的待遇。這樣一來。德國在南國的貿易關係中就佔着非常重要的地位。例如在去年南國輸出貿易總額中。法國僅佔百分之一•二六。而德國則佔百分之一九•八六之多。這種百分比額的差別還不重要。更重要的是德國從南國輸入的多是軍火原料。而且這種原料的輸出。德國還享有獨佔權。</p>
<p>這種經濟上的優越地位。當然會在政治上發生重大的影響。尤其是在德國宣傳部的積極宣傳下。南國的親德勢力更形發展起來。南國所有新聞社。差不多都已成為德國國民社的支部。至於親德派的領袖。在政界方面。有柯羅細茲（Koroshetz）博士。在軍界方面。有齊去柯維奇（Zivkovitch）將軍。柯氏為斯洛文天主敎蕉領袖。現任內相。在政治上的勢力很大。齊氏為前王亞力山大的親信。在軍隊中地位非常重要。同時現內閣的親德色彩也很濃厚。在這樣的情形下。牛賴特此行的成功。當然是有很大的把握的。</p>
<p>至於保加里亞。過去雖與意國的關係非常密切。但近九年來納粹的勢力日益增長起來。二國的經濟關係尤為密切。在一九三五年。保加里亞對德的輸出佔其總輸出額的百分之四八。而其從德國的輸入。則佔其總輸入額中的百分五三•五。在去年的首數月中。保國對德的輸出竟增至百分之六四之高。這種情形是任何國家間所罕見的。在這樣的經濟優勢下。納粹勢力自然很易在保國長足發展。何况保國內還有前任首相張柯夫（TsanKov）極力主張親德呢。</p>
<p>由於納粹勢力在南保諸國早已奠下鞏固的基礎。這次牛賴特的使命很有完成的可能性。等到這種使命成功。德國得到充分的原料供給而大量擴充軍力後。它的外交政策恐怕又要從溫和而轉變到暴烈吧。這是維護和平的國家不能不及早防備的。</p>

<p>聚衆一百餘人赴所、要求照常擺設之事、</p>
<p>雖經勸導而散但仍任意擺設如故、爰由該</p>
<p>所長於前晨（七日）再派員警取締、詎該</p>

<p>情勢與國策內容之如何尤多未曉茲為抉剔</p>
<p>謬誤起見、僅就所列十欵、逐一答辯如次</p>

<p>萬不料起訴書以偵查四個月之時間、竟於</p>
<p>救國會文件之原文尚未加以細閱、一端如</p>
<p>此、其他可知、再查該宣言中所載類似而</p>

<h3>雛</h3>
<p>— 林加</p>
<p>若是在家鄉，這時候我又養着幾匹黃</p>
<p>色黑色的小雛鷄了。</p>
<p>田野上的麥子金閃閃浮在陽光下，春</p>
<p>天已經去遠了。杜鵑烏那麼殷勤的唱着“</p>
<p>割麥插禾”，種瓜的園中也搭起閣子樣的</p>
<p>瓜棚來，天氣越來越暖了。農人們戴上葦</p>
<p>笠守在地頭邊，用打偸麥漢的小杉木棍敲</p>
<p>着硬泥地，一聲連一聲的唱道五月里，是</p>
<p>端陽，賢妻死去好凄涼，雄黃酒，懶得嘗</p>
<p>，……</p>
<p>伴着這樸素的歌聲，打鄉村的街道上</p>
<p>也傳來一聲幽長的呼喚：“誰買小鵝兒喽</p>
<p>，病了換……”</p>
<p>這販子是令孩子們熱愛的，他們的身</p>
<p>子都很高大，脚上穿一雙爬山撒鞋，深色</p>
<p>的粗布褲子給一條五寸寬的板腰帶結着，</p>
<p>酱黑而緊實的脊背上，斜披件小布衫，大</p>
<p>得像付車輪的草帽罩住腦頂，肩膀上有枝</p>
<p>兩頭蹺的細木扁擔，每頭下有八股麻繩，</p>
<p>拴了那個大小睡四個六歲孩子不會擁擠的</p>
<p>篾筐。他沙沙地踏着那烟霧樣的灰塵，走</p>
<p>過一個個農家的籬笆，等那柵欄門中邁出</p>
<p>一個白髮蓬鬆的老婆婆，或幾個泥鰍似的</p>
<p>赤光光的孩子，他用這引人的聲調重復一</p>
<p>聲，便選一棵大樹蔭或磨棚下，放了擔子</p>
<p>，揭開那一層稀麻布的篾筐蓋，一陣瑣碎</p>
<p>而淸晰的啾啾聲”，像一盤飢蠶吃着剛採</p>
<p>來的桑葉似的，無停無息的亂嗚着。</p>
<p>筐子里幾百雙杏黃茸毛的，十撥鼠似</p>
<p>的黑色發光的，每個都生命力充實而活躍</p>
<p>的跳動着，仰起牠們帶有尖嘴的小腦袋，</p>
<p>溜轉着那一雙驚異的圓眼，向這陌生的大</p>
<p>世界驚奇的唧唧呌喚。</p>
<p>老婆婆跟孩子都有他們的夢，用她一</p>
<p>夜紡四兩棉綫賺來的錢，孩子們使那年節</p>
<p>叩頭掙來的押歲錢，同樣的保守着那份祖</p>
<p>傳來農民性格，選擇着，爭吵着，計算下</p>
<p>錢數，嘆口氣說：</p>
<p>“這麼貴，不買了”，</p>
<p>鷄販子用慣應付這批人的口氣答道</p>
<p>“老太太，你看好了，一隻鷄，保有</p>
<p>五兩重，我敢打赌，這个黃白色的是小母</p>
<p>貨，養大的下蛋，準不隔窩，有四個鷄蛋</p>
<p>就够了本！……”</p>
<p>“你別說，糧食呢？”</p>
<p>“養猪呢？”</p>
<p>“養猪為要糞。”</p>
<p>“猪要喂，鷄自己會找食兒，”</p>
<p>結果祖母和孫兒把扣在手心里的銅錢</p>
<p>數給販子，用一口小圓簸羅揣回家，孩子</p>
<p>們再不願離開那剝啜米粒吃的小鷄，夜里</p>
<p>為防禦貪饞的貓，把一雙小蓆簍掛到樑上</p>
<p>，然而常常是白費了心計，一匹靈利的貓</p>
<p>竟在夜深時，不咪咪一聲的把可憐的小雛</p>
<p>鷄吃凈了去。</p>
<p>十五年了，我離開了那被高貴人們目</p>
<p>為土撥鼠的生活，弟妹們也許在這時候仍</p>
<p>在玩弄那些小鷄，也要因家中日漸窮困沒</p>
<p>了餘錢來買那可愛的小東西也說不定，我</p>
<p>想念家，我也想像童年似的過那平靜而純</p>
<p>朴的日子。</p>
<h3>三種認識</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>宋哲元先生示人：中國人須有世界的認織，中國人須有日本的認織，中國人須有中國的認鐵，人人能如此，方可以談到救國。這話說得極對！做今日的中國人，這一種認識，是十分必要的！否則，什麼都談不到，國也就無從救起了、然而對於世界，對於日本，對於我國，我們應有怎樣的認識呢？</p>
<p>對於世界，我們須明白：目前的國際關係，楚錯綜複雜的。這裏面，有侵略陣綫與和平陣綫的對立，有右傾思想與左傾思想的衝突，有帝國主義與被壓迫民族的鬥爭，還有帝國主義間的火併。這些危機，爆發是很有可能的。今日的世界，正朝戰爭的方向進行，在這個紛擾的大局中，要求立足的，應以本身的力量去爭鬥，倚賴別人，是不成的。任令强者安排，更非辦法。這是自取滅亡呵！</p>
<p>對於日本，我們應看清楚：日本是一個黷武國家，抱向外發展的野心。而中國，便是它的侵略的最大目標！東北土地，已給他們用武力奪去了。現在對方正致全力於圖謀華北。日本對於我國的侵路，最終目的是大陸政策的實現，明乎此，我們要應付，就須先下一决心！不然，中國有一日，怕會做日本的臣民！</p>
<p>對於本國，我們要認識：目前的中國，國難日趨嚴重整個國家，在强敵的覬覦下，時時有滅亡的危險！故我們要救國，唯一的出路，只有發動民族鬥爭，從死裏去求生存這項工作，自然是極艱困的。但我們不必灰心，也不要餒氣，只要大家覺悟，一致奮發起來，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>實不難做到挽回厄運，復興民族的地歩！</p>
<p>以上幾點，是我個人的觀察，和别人也許有不同的地方，但大抵與事實相差不遠才是。總之，我們明白世界的大勢，方能從時局變動中，决定所以自處的途徑。我們看淸日本的態度，方能在重力壓廹下，採取抵抗方法！我們瞭解自己的情形，方能拼出整個的力量，爲國家而奮鬥！這即兵法所謂知彼知己，是今日談救國者，不能不深深加以注意的！</p>
<h3>剩餘的爭取</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>這半流浪的生活，連吃飯的時間和地方都沒有一定，跑遍了以“經濟”標榜的飯店，嚐盡了各種不同的滋味，四川店家偏於辣，北方店家辣中有時帶點辛酸，廣東店家的飯生硬梗喉，這點飯菜與我的胃口都不大合適，為了圖個飽，也祗能勉强下咽了•合胃口的只有家鄉的飯菜，鹹中隱含着些甜味，然而日益貧瘠的家鄉早不能容留我了呵。生活的巨風把我吹飄出來，來到這號稱富庶的都市，使用出畢生的氣力，瞪大了潤濕的眼睛，去爭取別人的一點剩餘，這剩餘，在另一般人却認為整個生活的源泉了。</p>
<p>也許人類生活的享受永遠不能獲得平衡，在都市，把這不平衡的生活的兩方面，表演得更明白些。洋樓上有人有吃—已經是吃膩了的山珍海味，洋樓下階石上，却正有人坐着在貪婪地呑糙糠.當我在馬路上看見那些贏瘦骯髒的“小癟三”攔住挑飯司務的去路，爭取籠擔裏剩餘的殘肴冷飯時，我覺得自己還算是比較些幸福的。自己的生活雖也在爭取中獲得，但不必挨罵，挨打，挨踢……挨種種似非人頻所應，也所不能忍受的侮辱。可是，這等樣的悲劇却到處搬演着：</p>
<p>是在一家排塲並不大的飯店裏，傍晚時候我做了座上客，因為吃客多，飯菜呌下要費工夫等。靠門口坐的是位單身客，已經吃舒齊了，揩臉，用牙打剔牙縫，喝茶，看夜報，面孔紅紅的，知道還喝過些酒，樣子十分舒服。在他桌上，還剩餘着大半碗飯，半塊四喜肉，和一點鷄骨，像我的胃口，這點剩餘物亦足夠一飽了。但為要保持一種自尊，决不會去懇求他賜與的。</p>
<p>但懇求賜與的人是有的，就在他面前，在那扇玻璃門旁邊，一個瘦如骷髏，髒得和鬼差不多的人，他斷斷續績的說着：“先生，桌子上這些東西賞給了我吧，先……生……譬如……譬如府上養一隻狗……”聲音放低，怕旁人聽見了似的。凹在深瞠裏的眼珠瞪着桌上那半碗飯，半塊肉，和那些零碎的鷄骨，那位吃客毫沒在意地仍看着報，易牙縫喝茶，樣子很舒服•我眞想上去知照他，或代他行這方便，然而沒有，我仍被－種自尊心壓制着：多什麼事呢。</p>
<p>堂倌還沒有把飯菜搬來，我索性看着這幕劇搬演下去：</p>
<p>玻璃門旁邊又多了個襤褸的人，年紀比前一個輕，兩口兒雖同是在飢餓壓迫之下的，看神情却處於敵對地位。前一個的右脚已跨進門檻，兩隻手伸呵伸，而又不敢貿然伸出的樣子，他依然放底喉嚨，說着懇求賞賜剩餘飯菜的話，眼睛偷睨着堂倌，大約畏懼堂倌的干涉驅逐吧。我看得很淸楚，他的手臂在抖，他的腿足亦在抖，後面一個祇露出個黝黑的臉龐在前一個肩頭上，似乎也在迫切地等候一個機會的來到，眼睛也牢牢地盯着桌上的剩餘物。</p>
<p>那位吃客牧起夜報，站起預備要走，這才聽到這已經說了好一刻工夫的懇情話，他帶着三分醉意無可無不可的歪歪嘴，玻璃門邊那人已衝了進來，還沒來得及動手抓那剩餘的飯菜，後面個年輕的也緊跟而進，變成四隻手在爭取那桌上的殘肴餘飯了。“我早跟這位先生討的，你搶！“大家分一點，飽飽肚皮。”兩個子在客人面前爭吵起來，客人惱怒了：“一個都沒有，去去去……”，堂倌送上我的飯菜，急忙過去把兩人趕出門去，收拾盆碗，把湯湯水水：併在一個傢伙裏，望一望門外，“癟三，要吃飯拿錢來！”諷刺了一句，搬着盆碗走了。我捧起飯碗，望着玻璃門外兩張苦惱的臉，我感覺自己的生活雖亦矚剩餘的爭取，可畢竟還算幸福的。人類的生活幾時才能獲得平衡呢？這樣思忖着……</p>
<h3>鬼之市</h3>
<p>— 江鳥</p>
<p>當蛙聲的煩噪還沒有劃破空氣的沉寂之前，那冷落的灰暗底角落裏，這時候，也許是個鬼之市吧？</p>
<p>尋不到旅人們的足痕，偶而有幾聲遠處傳來的狗吠：於是一切都歸沉寂，沉寂。</p>
<p>黃昏了，一縷縷的炊烟從遠村的烟突的口裏吐出來，渐渐地模糊，消失了。</p>
<p>街燈在閃爍着幽暗的光芒。</p>
<p>一堆堆失去了靈塊的人們—許是一架肉身的機器，淫蕩媚人底浮雕遮掩了心和身的創傷，鬼影似地有那裏擁擠着</p>
<p>他們都拖着疲倦得夠了身體，嘴裏吐着噴人的酒氣，眼皮沉重地垂下，解開了衣扣，露出赤色的油膩的胸膛，流着汗滴，咕嚕着簡陋的枯的不動聽的曲調，一個個到這裏來找尋他們的安慰</p>
<p>他們時常為着自己片刻的幸福和同伴吵架，謾罵，…………</p>
<p>四週盪動騷擾的聲浪。</p>
<p>月亮拋下潔白的素紗，斜斜地掛在東方。</p>
<p>“鬼之市”又醞釀起灰色的綺夢了！</p>
<h3>介紹蔣委員長西安半月記</h3>
<p>介紹蔣委員長西安半月記</p>
<p>西北為我中華民族之發祥地，而前此西安事雙之解决，實為我中華民族之再生機，雖在時過景遷之今日，吾人每一憶及西安事變之情彤，猶不禁擾心如禱、默祝民族領袖之安全。</p>
<p>西安事變，誠如將夫人所謂一為我國命運最後一次革命正義之鬥爭，一當事變緊張之時，舉國上下一心，擾形於色，以前此未有之一致精神，一致呼聲，為唯一之民族領袖奔走號呼，深知西安事變一日解决，領袖一日安然出險，則我淪陷水火中之民族，方能重獲一綫更生之希望，雖然國人此舉，係發自艱難困阨目怵危亡之迫切的愛護領袖心理，但以此亦足反證國人對領袖不辭勞等公忠為國之日誠的深訓認識，徵我領袖無以張拔於中華民族於萬刧中，亦徵舉國同胞團結一致愛護領袖，無以克成救亡圖存之艱鉅計劃，國人此種認識，實不啻復與民族之精神基礎，而此精神基礎，乃充分表示於西安事變之日，西安事變，非僅國人之國家觀念的試金石，實寫中華民族對於復興要之總表示也。</p>
<p>前此吾人誦讀蔣委員長離西安前對張楊之訓話全文，大義磅礴，慷慨激昂，罔不感極欲涕，唯其以至誠許國之心，方能發此至誠感人之語，不僅足為吾人立身之法則，而其偉大精神，尤足永為歷史上之至高教訓，最近正中書局將蔣委員長在西安之半月日記，及蔣夫人宋美齡女士對西安事變之回憶錄，編印成軼，使吾人於此次在民族復興史上具曾重大意義之事蹟中，更能深見領袖之偉大人格，興夫表現於領袖行為中之至大至剛之民族性，而為困茲危境，對內力事建設對外長期抗戰之每一個民族鬥士不可缺少之勇武精神。</p>
<p>蔣委員長一身錯綜萬機，系國家安危之重，致使西安事變之消息廣播全壞，舉世震駭，此於蔣夫人手記之回憶錄中，尤可以明覓富時種種形勢，富事變產生，舉國慘然，而夫人公私正義之感，交戰於胸。獨能克制情感，處處以國家人民為重，於雨雪萊川堅冰在途之日，萬里間關，携全國人民之最後希望，躬入虎穴，在極惡劣之空氣中，縱横捭闔，卒以正義克服强橫，護衛領袖出險，重措國家於泰山之安，其回憶錄文采華瞻，已足為極珍貴之史文學材料，尤其吾人曠觀史乘，世之英勇女性立德立功，亦殊未有夫人此次之習偉，使全國人民感激無已者，謹援數語，為此歷史上極有價值之文獻介紹。須知吾人讀此書，不僅獲知西安事變之種種眞相，抑且領袖之言行尤足為吾人永久之法式也。</p>

<h3>怎樣開倒車</h3>
<p>— 為</p>
<p>在停車塲要把車身倒開入一個規定而又狹窄的地方。是學習駕駛術中最後而又最困難的一課。許多人雖能變速或在半山上重新開車。然而呌他們倒退排入停車處的時候。他們就要呆住了。這件事情的理由是很清楚的。因為這是駕駛術中最困難的部份。所以敎授的人往往自己駛給初學者看。而不直接敎初學者實習。這是個錯誤。因為只有漸漸的實習。初學者才能有進步。</p>
<p>在開倒車進入停車處的時候。駕駛者必須能做二件事。第一要他能獨手轉向正確。還有一只手留着。預備用手扳制動機停車或變速。第二要他必能善用接合器和加速器。這樣就能以最慢的速率進退。如果對於車的速度沒有把握。開倒車不是件平穩的事情。因為在某種塲合上。卽使每小時四哩的速度還會嫌其太快。况且對速度沒有把握就會生疑懼。而疑懼又會把自信心消滅的。</p>
<p>車後的視綫不好。開倒車的時候速度須極慢。所以初學的人於自信心完全獲得之前。最好在篷車上練習。因為沒有了屏障物向四方的視綫就可不受阻碍。開倒車的困難就可减去很多。實習的時候須在空塲上。而且要獨自一人。因為一位心神不安定的駕駛者疑懼站在他旁邊的人。最初。練習向車後的直綫駛去。事前當然應該看淸楚車後確無障碍和危險。然後沿着人行道一直駛去。這個方法不宜行在尋常的路上。因為那裏的來往車輛不是預先所能料到的。駛行的時候把手臂擱在車門上。左手放在轉向輪上以便轉向。再把頭伸出車窗外。這樣可以看淸沿着車外的情形。這個方法在狹窄的地方很有用處。否則就難於退入一個限定的地位。還有一個方法。就是用駛車鏡。不過這只能用在寬暢的地方。有困難的排車術之前。須先有初步的實習。直至能在比車身僅闊數寸的地方—牠的方向不論是直綫的或斜角的—隨意進退。實習的時候可以用二根竹竿。不必在眞的們口實習。實習的時候。把二根竹竿的距離漸漸縮短。萬一把車駛錯了。也不至傷害車身。並且學者很容易發覺前輪並非總是跟着後輸走的，在開倒車的時候。有時後部已平安地經過門柱而前部却受到損傷。所以車的後部雖然平安地駛過了門柱。我們對於前部還得嚴密地注意。總之。排車入停車塲是駕駛中最難的事情。倒車。變速。突然停車等。都是需要而又重要的技術。</p>
<p>要把車排入已經停在路旁的兩輛車中間。最好的方法是把車先駛過這個空檔。然後把車倒退進去。將後輸停在預備車停妥後所停的地方。再用轉向輪把前輪轉進去。這種塲合單獨用向前駛的方法是不會奏效的。</p>
<h3>春季末的美國汽車事業</h3>
<p>— 宇</p>
<p>三月份產額打破紀錄</p>
<p>在不久之前，美國的汽車生產中心地底特羅地方鬧着罷工風潮，那時候有一部份人就很担心，恐怕因此而影響到汽車的產量，幸而這種罷工風潮為時並不甚久，勞資雙方經過幾度接洽之後，一塲風波，漸告平息，各廠在罷工時期中，雖然多少都受些影響，然而經過各當局事後的努力，把已經失却的時候工作等，逐一補償起來，所以結果不但不壞，竟使一九三七年三月份的汽車產量，在汽車製造史上創造了一個新紀錄，成為自一九二九年六月份以來最好的一個月哩。</p>
<p>美國汽車業中的幾個鉅頭，像通用福特，克雷斯勒等，在這時期中都有很好的成績表現出來，通用廠在罷工潮開漲的時候，曾經有幾次歇工，復有產品，可是一到風潮解决，他們便開足馬力，努力生產，達到盡量力產的階段，他們各股中的兩股，其生產量之多，成為他們有史以來的最高頂點，因之出產量之高，着實驚人，福特方面和克雷斯勒也不相上下，物量幾達最高限度，每天的造成車輛數，大數在七○○○輛左右，當罷工潮緊張而暫把他們的工廠停歇的時候，克雷斯勒和赫特森廠的出品也正在最高潮中。</p>
<p>高價汽車的暢銷，可以表示市面的繁榮，各汽車廠的出品中，凡是有售價每輛美金一•○○○元或千元上的汽車的，都有着很好的營業，福特廠所造的高價車之一“林肯賽飛”銷數之多，較之一年前高出幾達三倍，在目下流行型年中的零售交貨數，已達一○•○○○輛之多，所以三月底止的林肯賽飛的出品比之一九三六年將增進多多。（未完）</p>
<h3>紐約拖車展覽記</h3>
<p>— 聶</p>
<p>最近美國南紐約和康諾底干的汽車經售商人，在“白野”地方的西吉士脫郡中心，舉行一個紐約車展的拖車展覽會，這是在紐約的地方的創舉，所有較著的汽車拖車製造公司的出品，都參予其盛，有幾家拖車製造商因為要把他們的出品和汽車的協調顯現出來，所以同時也把汽車陳列在一起，這幾家便是考特•杜森堡•福特•林肯•納許•拉飛德•派卡•克雷斯勒•和潑萊茅斯。</p>
<p>在會塲中所陳列着的各式拖車，其最大的特色便是內部配合緊凑，凡是現代家庭中日用所不可缺少的東西，在拖車裏是沒有一樣不全備的，可是東西雖多，因為配備適宜，仍不失其寬暢舒適的特色。</p>
<p>女太太們所最注意的衣櫉和烹調用器，有各式的拖車中莫不齊備，其他如䬸桌•休息椅•書櫉•盤架•淋浴器•甚至浴缸等，應有盡有，汽車中的各種裝置，大半可隨顧客的意思重為配裝，祇要先和經售商商妥好了。</p>
<p>這種“活動家庭”計劃時，各製造廠對於冰箱•給水•熱水汀•通風裝置•等，最為留心，因為這些東西在現代的家庭中是萬不可少的。</p>
<p>所有陳列的各式拖車中，有兩輛最為觀衆們所注意，一為西聯電報屆所特造的，內部裝置作為傳達站之用，在緊急事情發生的時候，像最近哇海華的水災，可用為電報轉遞站，使得電訊交通不致中斷，其二為塞立凡牧師所定造的一輛拖車，將來預備專作為到中國傳道之用，在會塲中參觀的牧帥們，對於這輛拖車的設備，大感興趣，有很多人願意仿造，以便在四鄉作為宣揚福音的專車。</p>
<p>會塲中尚有專門陳列“零件”的一部，其中有一架紐約自動電池裝注公司的出品，這架機器能把水櫃中所儲的水打入電池，這水櫃中的水可備走一○•○○○英里，不必重裝，附連於此機的有一個測量表，示水平和電池瓶的實在情形，據說，這種裝注器對於拖車使用者有很大的用處呢。</p>
<p>這次拖車展覽期一共是六天，會期中前往參觀的非常踴躍，據估計人數在二○•○○○名左右，會塲經理為納討爾氏，據他說今年秋季將在同地點重復舉行一次，不過在規模方面恐怕要小一些罷了。</p>
<p>紐約拖車展覽以前從來沒有舉行過，所以這次實在是破題兒第一遭，總計參加展覽的有製造商或經售商十四家，計共拖車三十八輛，當塲在會塲中售出的拖車共四十五輛，不過有許多人雖沒有决定要買，而意思中是很願意置一輛的，凡是這些戶頭都已由經售商記下來，預備呌銷售員去推銷，因之這次展覽會的結果，大家認為很滿意哩。</p>

<h3>Liu Hangchen Arrives in Beijing to Meet with He Yingqin and Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>Welcoming He to Sichuan to Preside Over the Military Reorganization Conference; Smooth Progress Expected in Reorganization Prospects; Zhang Qun's Trip to Sichuan is in a Personal Capacity</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Finance Department, visited Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan last week to report and seek instructions. He arrived in Beijing on the Yihe Wheel steamer at 1:00 PM on the eighth. That evening, at 9:00 PM, he met with Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun, and others to continue seeking instructions. He will remain in Beijing for two or three days, awaiting Minister He and Secretary-General Zhang's decision to enter Sichuan, after which Liu will return to Sichuan first. Liu Hangchen told interviewers that the six measures discussed and agreed upon in the military reorganization plan for Sichuan and Kang were instructed by Minister He. When he met with Chiang Kai-shek, he was instructed that Chairman Liu Fucheng had already replied to the telegram, agreeing to follow the central government's methods and immediately begin implementing the reorganization. The central government's designated officials to enter Sichuan are Minister He and his party. Liu Fucheng has already sent telegrams to Minister He and Secretary-General Zhang, welcoming them. He himself will be able to decide when he meets with the two leaders He and Zhang tonight. It is also understood that the central government's reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs will involve nationalizing all troops into the National Army. Before the reorganization, a reorganization committee will be formed to carry out the reorganization according to the methods stipulated in the implementation plan, with a reasonable deadline to complete this work. He also said that Chiang Kai-shek is very clear about the situation in Sichuan Province, so there are already solutions to the problem of reorganizing Sichuan and Kang military affairs, which will be implemented separately according to Minister He's plan. It is stipulated that the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Military Affairs Commission's Chongqing Branch, and the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Commissioner's Office will be responsible. Senior officials from the three agencies and some officers from the Sichuan-Kang garrison will serve as reorganization committee members, forming a committee to be responsible for presiding over the reorganization. The meeting location will be Chongqing or Chengdu. Regarding Sichuan Province's hope that the central government will send high-ranking political officials to Sichuan to instruct political construction, the candidates will be Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Zhang Qun and Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, which should be decided in the coming days. As for Chairman Liu's visit to Beijing, he is currently ill and unable to leave Sichuan for the time being. After the central government's military and political officials enter Sichuan, Liu will come to Beijing to report to the central government, despite his illness. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Hangchen arrived in Beijing at 1:00 PM on the eighth from Xun, aboard the Pinghe Wheel steamer. That evening, he met with Minister He to report on his trip to Guling and, on behalf of Liu Xiang, Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan and Kang, welcomed Minister He to Sichuan to preside over the implementation of the major plan to reorganize Sichuan and Kang military affairs. He plans to stay in Beijing for a few days before returning to Sichuan to report. According to Liu's statement to reporters, when he met with Chiang Kai-shek in Guling, he fully reported on the reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs on behalf of Chairman Liu and expressed absolute acceptance, which was greatly appreciated. Scholars such as Yan Yangchu and Chen Zhishan previously jointly drafted a plan to build Sichuan in a personal capacity, which included the reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs. As a result, there were rumors that Chairman Liu intended to change the central government's original plan to reorganize Sichuan and Kang military affairs through political means. He also clarified the truth to Chiang Kai-shek during this trip to Guling, which was understood. He further explained that Liu's telegrams regarding accepting the reorganization of Sichuan and Kang military affairs were all sent by him on Liu's behalf, and he was concerned that this might not be credible enough. Therefore, he telegraphed Sichuan from Guling, urging Chairman Liu to express directly to the central government. It was not until the fifth, when he learned that Chairman Liu's telegram had arrived in the mountains, that he left the mountains and came east. Now there is no problem with the plan to reorganize Sichuan and Kang military affairs, only in quickly promoting its implementation. According to the plan, the Minister of Military Affairs, the Director of the Chongqing Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, and the Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan and Kang should jointly establish a Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee, responsible for implementing all reorganization matters. He is coming to Beijing this time on behalf of Chairman Liu to welcome Minister He to come to Sichuan as soon as possible to preside over the establishment of the Sichuan-Kang Military Reorganization Committee. Chairman Liu has no preconceived notions about whether the committee will be located in Chongqing or Chengdu, but will follow Minister He's intentions. As for the future of the reorganization, in his observation, it will definitely proceed smoothly. Even the most important aspect, financial management, which all parties consider to be the most difficult, does not pose any difficulty. Although Sichuan and Kang's military expenses are 41 million yuan per year, since the year before last, the Financial Supervision Office of the Chongqing Branch has been responsible for overall planning and distribution. If reorganization is implemented, it is only necessary to improve the method of issuing funds to the generals. Other aspects, such as command, dispatch, personnel, education, and organization, are easier to solve. Liu also said that Guan Jiyu is still in Guling seeking instructions on the 1937 Sichuan Province budget preparation method. Because the military reorganization plan has been finalized, the method of budget preparation can also be easily resolved. Finally, when asked about Zhang Qun's trip to Sichuan, Liu said that Chairman Liu had telegraphed the central government, requesting that military and political officials be sent to Sichuan for inspection. In addition to Minister He, who has already been designated for military affairs, the candidate for political affairs has not yet been decided. Mr. Zhang is an ideal candidate, but Mr. Zhang has expressed his willingness to enter Sichuan in a personal capacity. Chairman Liu plans to come east for a trip after the central government's military and political officials have completed their inspection in Sichuan. (Eighth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>No Need for Silent Contemplation in Ordinary Gatherings</h3>
<p>—National Government Instruction—</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government recently instructed all directly subordinate agencies that, in accordance with the Central Executive Committee's reply, the purpose of the three-minute silent contemplation was to commemorate the Premier's past words and deeds and the self-reflection of party members on their work during the week. In recent years, silent contemplation has been held in all public and private gatherings, and the people have misunderstood it as a government ordinance, forcing them to hold it reluctantly and hastily, which is contrary to the original intention. Therefore, it has been decided at a regular meeting that, henceforth, except for the Premier's Commemoration Week and gatherings commemorating the Premier and the martyrs and sages, there shall be no need for silent contemplation in order to show rectitude. Let all subordinates abide by this. (Eighth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Municipal Government Plans to Issue Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Nanjing Municipal Government, in order to subsidize the needs of various construction projects within the year 1937, has previously requested the central government to issue 960,000 yuan in treasury bonds, which is currently under review by the Ministry of Finance. The purpose of the treasury bonds is to subsidize various construction projects, with housing donations as collateral. The original amount was set at 3 million yuan, which was to be issued in three years in principle, 1 million yuan per year and 250,000 yuan per quarter. This time it was changed to 960,000 yuan, which will also be issued in four seasons within this year. Therefore, although the amount has been reduced, the principle remains the same. Each quarter will be issued for three months, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid upon maturity, with one issue and one repayment in six months, so as to ensure that the funds needed are available and construction can be promoted.

<h3>Yesterday's Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Shanghai newspapers reported yesterday that a partial solar eclipse could be seen in northern Jiangsu Province on the eighth. According to the person in charge of the Central Astronomical Observatory, there will be two solar eclipses this year: the solar eclipse on the eighth of this month and the annular eclipse on December 3. Neither will be visible in any part of China. There will be only one partial lunar eclipse on the 18th, but when the moon rises on that evening in most parts of China, the lunar shadow will have already recovered, so it will not be visible. Only in the northeastern part of China, where the moon rises earlier, will it be slightly visible. As for the total solar eclipse on the eighth, most of it will be in the Pacific Ocean, and it will be difficult to find suitable islands for observation. Only Peru in South America will be able to see it on the mainland, but the sun will be very low at that time, and the star field will not be good, so very few countries have sent observation teams. In China, the partial eclipse will not be visible either. (Eighth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The Qingdao Observatory predicts that the total solar eclipse will occur in South America at 4:00 AM on the ninth, with the totality path passing through the Pacific Ocean for about seven minutes and four seconds. It will not be visible in Qingdao. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

The above-listed defendants, having been prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crimes of murder and disturbing public order and endangering public safety, this court, after trial, renders the following judgment:</p>
<p>Main Text: Cheng Xiechao, found guilty of joint murder, sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights; Gong Bozhou, found guilty of continuous joint murder, sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights; Cao Bingrong, found guilty of joint murder, sentenced to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights; Liu Luyin, found guilty of inciting murder, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for five years; Yang Qixin, found guilty of continuous joint preparation for murder, sentenced to two years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for two years; Liu Luyin, Cheng Xiechao, Gong Bozhou, Cao Bingrong, and Yang Qixin are acquitted of the remaining charges; Li Yijian is acquitted; Nie Jingquan, found guilty of assisting in the sale of military firearms and ammunition without permission, sentenced to two years of imprisonment with deprivation of civil rights for two years; Wen Maoquan's public prosecution is not accepted; one planning document, one handgun, six bullets, one bullet casing are confiscated. Facts: Liu Luyin was elected as a standing committee member of the People's Movement Committee last year and, not fully understanding the central government's efforts for the country, incited Yang Xiaoming, using the alias Xu Qun (also known as Yang Erqian, Yang Yousheng, Yang Pakun, Yang Qizhen, Xu Chao), to organize a special task force (i.e., an assassination agency) in Shanghai to assassinate Yang Yongtai, the former chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government (hereinafter referred to as Chairman Yang), former Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Interior Minister Jiang Zuobin, and Transportation Minister Yu Feipeng (hereinafter referred to as Minister Zhang, Minister Jiang, and Minister Yu), and Chiang Kai-shek. Subsequently, seeing that opportunities were difficult to come by in Shanghai, they planned to expand their organization in Nanjing and Hubei, with Shanghai still serving as the headquarters for promotion. Yang Xiaoming, under the name Xu Qun, drafted a plan, naming his organization the "China Youth Anti-Traitor Special Task Force," and submitted it to Liu Luyin for approval in his capacity as a standing committee member of the People's Movement Committee, allocating 2,000 yuan per month, which was remitted by Ru Yun. Later, Yang Xiaoming summoned Xiao Zhun (i.e., Xiao Peiwei, Fan Qishu, Liang Jiubao, Gong Bozhou, Yang Qixin, etc.) to organize the special task force in Nanjing and Hubei in accordance with Liu Luyin's approved plan. In May of the same year, Lu Zhun sent a letter instructing Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou to go to Lushan to observe Chiang Kai-shek's movements, believing that Guanyin Bridge was a suitable place to strike. In August, Yang Xiaoming summoned Yang Qixin and Gong Bozhou to Shanghai, personally ordering them to investigate Minister Zhang's whereabouts in Nanjing, believing that the Overseas Chinese Reception Center was suitable for sniping. They pretended to prepare for the assassination in September. Yang Xiaoming ordered Gong Bozhou to take a handgun to Nanjing and then come to Hankou, where he and Xiao Zhun, Fan Qishu, Liang Jiubao, Cao Bingrong, and others hid at No. 35, Erjiao Street, New Tai'an Inn. Fan Qishu introduced his friend Cheng Xiechao, who was unemployed in Hankou, to join the assassination organization. In July of the same year, he asked Nie Jingquan to persuade Wen Maoquan to privately purchase a handgun along with bullets and gave them to Cheng Xiechao for use. Yang Xiaoming secretly gave the Yang Yongtai's photo to the team members to identify, first attempting to assassinate in Sandao Street, Wuchang, and near the Hubei Provincial Government, but failed. They then discussed changing the plan and waiting for an opportunity by the river at the Hankou wharf. On the morning of October 25th, Yang Xiaoming and Cao Bingrong found out that Chairman Yang would attend a banquet in Hankou. They followed him across the river, and Yang Xiaoming ordered Cao Bingrong to stand at the People's Information Office at the wharf as a marker and to be responsible for keeping watch. He then returned to the New Qin'an Inn and ordered Cheng Xiechao and Gong Bozhou to carry handguns loaded with live ammunition to wait at the wharf. He secretly supervised and directed the operation on-site. When Chairman Yang arrived in a car at 3:00 PM and had taken only a few steps after getting out of the car, Cheng Xiechao approached him from behind and fired two shots at his back, both hitting vital points, and he died soon after. Cheng Xiechao was captured on the spot, and one handgun and six bullets and one bullet casing were found on him. (To be continued) (Central News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Significance of the German Foreign Minister's Visit to Southern Europe</h3>
<p>— Auxiliary</p>
<p>Since Germany's intervention in the Spanish Civil War suffered a major blow, its foreign policy has undergone considerable changes. It knows that blindly acting tough externally will not only encounter resolute resistance from the invaded countries but will also arouse resentment from various countries. At the same time, it deeply feels that the country has not been sufficiently prepared to act tough externally. Especially worrying is the severe lack of raw materials for manufacturing armaments. Therefore, its foreign policy has recently temporarily abandoned the method of acting tough and has adopted a gentler approach to improve external relations and strengthen its ability to develop outward. Under these circumstances, the old tune of Anglo-German amity has been revived, and German-Italian relations have seen further development. This visit by the German Foreign Minister to the countries of Southern Europe is also worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Neurat's trip to Southern Europe lasted about a week. The countries he visited included Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The mission he bore was not only to promote Nazi influence politically but also to establish a foundation for cooperation economically, so that the raw materials Germany needs could be adequately supplied by these countries. Can this important mission succeed? Let us examine it based on the current situation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about German-Yugoslav relations. Germany had already laid the foundation for amity in Yugoslavia. In economic terms, Schacht's magic hand had already plunged Yugoslavia into Germany's economic orbit. It used Yugoslavia's huge debt to Germany (in 1935, Yugoslavia owed Germany a huge debt of 3 million pounds) to force Yugoslavia to purchase large quantities of German goods and obtain preferential treatment in commerce. As a result, Germany occupied a very important position in Yugoslavia's trade relations. For example, in Yugoslavia's total export trade last year, France accounted for only 1.26 percent, while Germany accounted for as much as 19.86 percent. This difference in percentage is not that important. What is more important is that Germany imports mostly raw materials for armaments from Yugoslavia, and Germany enjoys exclusive rights over the export of these raw materials.</p>
<p>This economic advantage naturally has a significant impact on politics, especially under the active propaganda of the German Propaganda Department. The pro-German forces in Yugoslavia have grown stronger. Almost all news agencies in Yugoslavia have become branches of the German National Society. As for the leaders of the pro-German faction, in political circles, there is Dr. Koroshetz, and in military circles, there is General Zivkovitch. Koroshetz is the leader of the Slovenian Catholic Church and is currently the Minister of Interior, wielding great political power. Zivkovitch was a confidant of former King Alexander and holds a very important position in the army. At the same time, the current cabinet has a strong pro-German color. Under these circumstances, Neurat's success on this trip is of course highly certain.</p>
<p>As for Bulgaria, although its relationship with Italy was very close in the past, the influence of the Nazis has grown increasingly in the last nine years. The economic relations between the two countries are particularly close. In 1935, Bulgaria's exports to Germany accounted for 48 percent of its total exports, while its imports from Germany accounted for 53.5 percent of its total imports. In the first few months of last year, Bulgaria's exports to Germany increased to as high as 64 percent. This situation is rare among any countries. Under this economic advantage, Nazi influence naturally easily develops significantly in Bulgaria, especially since former Prime Minister TsanKov strongly advocates pro-German policies in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Because Nazi influence has already laid a solid foundation in the countries of Southern Europe, Neurat's mission has a high possibility of being accomplished. Once this mission is accomplished and Germany receives an adequate supply of raw materials to massively expand its military strength, its foreign policy will probably shift from gentle to violent again. This is something that countries that uphold peace cannot fail to prepare for early on.</p>

Although General Franco has consulted foreign history, this move seems to have been shelved. (Reuters, Central News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Four Countries Reach Understanding on Western Mediterranean Security Plan</h3>
<p>Drafting a Plan Based on British Proposals; Italy and Germany Expected to Return to the Adjustment Committee</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources today, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have reached an agreement on restoring the Spanish Western Mediterranean surveillance plan based on British proposals. A final plan is now being drafted to be submitted to both warring parties in Spain for implementation. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] According to well-informed sources, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have reached an understanding on the issue of Western Mediterranean surveillance, and Italy and Germany may return to the Non-Intervention Committee. It is claimed that the British government, after negotiations with France, Germany, and Italy, has begun drafting a new agreement, which will eventually be signed in London by the ambassadors of the countries concerned, and then the agreement will be delivered to the warring parties in Spain. (China News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] London sources now expect that Germany is unlikely to object to the British proposal that any unilateral action taken by the countries concerned in the event of an attack on naval vessels involved in maritime surveillance in the future should be limited to self-defense. The current key task is to work out a plan to ensure that the principles of consultation have sufficient force, as Germany, while not insisting on retaliatory action, is eager for a consultation mechanism that is not meaningless but should stipulate action that can uphold the dignity of international surveillance. Judging from the French reply, British and French views are almost identical. According to sources in Berlin's political circles, the exchange of views between Berlin and London is currently proceeding smoothly. Germany is expected to resume attending meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee by the end of this week. (Reuters, Central News Agency, Eighth Dispatch)</p>

Sources said that Neurath's talks with Stojadinović yesterday afternoon focused on economic cooperation among countries in the Danube River basin and genuine economic cooperation between major powers and Central European countries. In addition, Stojadinović explained Czechoslovakia's position toward Germany as a means of mediation. Furthermore, Yugoslavia's attitude towards Hungary's rearmament was entirely the same as that of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries. In other words, this issue could be resolved through negotiations among the countries concerned, but unilateral action would not be approved by the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente.

<p>⊙Yugoslav Capital. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović hosted a banquet for German Foreign Minister Neurath at 8:30 PM. Many important officials from both Germany and Yugoslavia attended. After the banquet, Stojadinović delivered a speech, hoping that the current relations between Germany and Yugoslavia would be further strengthened, and that the international agreements signed by the Yugoslav government with its friendly nations would promote international cooperation. In addition, any country with the possibility of cooperating with Yugoslavia should find ways to sign agreements with it. Yugoslavia is willing to promote cooperation between Yugoslavia and Germany and develop economic relations between the two countries in accordance with the spirit of the international treaties it has signed with other countries. Neurath responded, saying, "Hitler and the German people have always had friendly feelings towards Yugoslavia and firmly believe that the friendly relations between Germany and Yugoslavia have the possibility of further development. For this reason, we can exchange opinions and discuss the methods and goals of the two countries' foreign policies in a sincere and friendly spirit. This goal is to protect and enhance peace, which is self-evident." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)</p>

<h3>Blumberg's Visit Aims to Strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis</h3>
<p>Denies that the Trip Contains Secret Political Motives; Italian Navy Unafraid in Mediterranean Operations</p>
<p>⊙Naples, Italy. German Defense Minister General von Blomberg visited the Italian naval exercises today, ending at 5:00 PM. He then reviewed the honor guard and boarded Mussolini's private yacht at 8:00 PM, sailing to the port of Bava. When boarding the yacht, the crowd cheered at the dock, holding signs that read "Long live Hitler, Long live Blomberg." Before leaving, Blomberg gave a speech to the Italian semi-official news agency Stefani, saying, "If people mistakenly believe that my visit to Italy has secret political motives, it would be truly absurd. What Prime Minister Mussolini of your country and Leader Hitler of my country sincerely hope for is nothing more than to maintain world peace. We, as soldiers, all know that excellent weapons should be in the hands of excellent soldiers, so that they can dedicate themselves to the glory and freedom of their motherland. I believe that there may come a day when this happens. Furthermore, the strengthening of the Rome-Berlin political axis is the most outstanding way to guarantee world peace. If the result of my trip can further advance this path, then when I recall the glorious situation of my visit to your country in the future, I will be even more pleased."

<h3>Archduke Otto Candidate for Spanish Throne</h3>
<p>Mussolini Supports</p>
<p>[Paris] A certain prominent member of the Spanish Royalist Party recently gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter, stating that the old Habsburg royal family of Austria, which reigned over Spain from 1516 to 1700, now has its heir, Archduke Otto, as a candidate for the Spanish throne. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini supports this and will try to arrange a marriage between Archduke Otto and Italian Princess Maria, so that the Italian princess can be the mother of Spain in the future. Archduke Otto is currently in Biscay Province, Spain, visiting his uncle, Prince Gaston, who is injured. Archduke Otto's abandonment of the Austrian Royalist Party and engagement in propaganda in Spain shows that the claim that he is a candidate is not false. As for General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist military government, he originally supported the restoration of the throne to the deposed King Alfonso, but only Franco holds this view. Other leaders of the Nationalist army, especially General Queipo de Llano, commander of the southern front, although not opposed to the restoration, are unwilling for the Alfonso royal family to reign over Spain again. However, because the other heir to the Spanish throne, Prince Carlos of Bourbon, recently passed away without descendants, those who oppose Alfonso plan to welcome a foreign royal family to be the King of Spain. This is why Archduke Otto has put forward his candidacy. In short, there are currently four people qualified for the Spanish throne: the deposed King Alfonso, the deposed King's eldest son, the Count of Covadonga (who first married the daughter of a Cuban tycoon, and recently divorced again, planning to marry a beautiful model), the deposed King's third son, Prince Juan, and Archduke Otto of Austria. Who will ultimately reign over Spain is a matter for the Spanish people to decide. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)</p>

<h3>Cause of British Ship Hunter Explosion Determined</h3>
<p>Caused by Hitting a Mine</p>
<p>[London] The British Admiralty's Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Shakespeare, recently answered a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, saying that the Court of Inquiry has confirmed that the British destroyer "Hunter" did indeed hit a mine, causing an explosion. The ship hit the mine off the south coast of Spain, just a few miles from Almeria, where the water is 600 feet deep. Based on this information, the British government will protest to the Spanish Nationalist authorities, stating that laying mines on the high seas cannot be considered legal in the current war situation in Spain. The "Hunter" exploded while patrolling the sea on a surveillance mission, resulting in eight deaths and fourteen injuries. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from 7th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Dismissal of Russian Air Force Commander</h3>
<p>[London] According to the Finland correspondent of the Morning Post, Soviet Air Force Commander Alkonsnis has been dismissed. Alkonsnis was the creator of the Soviet Air Force. His dismissal is due to his friendship with Gamarnik, the Red Army's political leader who was recently arrested and committed suicide. The correspondent added that Alkonsnis invented the method of jumping with a parachute, equipping the jumper with hand grenades and machine guns, so that he could attack the enemy when landing. The dismissal of such a meritorious general shows Stalin's deep suspicion. (National News Agency, Hai Tong Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Southern Hemisphere "Solar Eclipse" Today</h3>
<p>Astronomers from Japan and the United States Observe on the Coast of Peru</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The appearance of the mysterious black sun in the Southern Hemisphere is imminent. Dr. Yamamoto Isshi and his party are determined to compete with the American observation team (observation site is Fincago, a rural area on the coast of Peru), adjusting their observation equipment, full of confidence, waiting for the opportunity. Regarding this competition between the Japanese team and the American team, South American astronomers, who are technically and theoretically behind, can only watch with wide eyes. This total solar eclipse will occur at 4:00 AM on the 9th, Japan time, starting from the British-owned Katuna-Cond-Fininger Islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east longitude 169 degrees 49 minutes, latitude 2 degrees 47 minutes, and ending at 7:20 PM, west longitude 70 degrees 51 minutes, latitude 12 degrees 47 minutes, near Lima, South America. The total eclipse time is seven minutes and four seconds, the longest total solar eclipse in eight years since 1929. The previous longest record was seven minutes and forty seconds, only thirty-six seconds longer. If this solar eclipse could be observed at sea, it would be a spectacle. Unfortunately, the observation site of the Japanese team and the American team, the coast of Peru, coincides with sunset on the day of the solar eclipse. The total eclipse time is short, and it is on land, with many obstacles such as mountains and clouds, so extremely fast observations must be made. This is a disadvantage for the Japanese and American observation teams in this session. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Brussels. Dr. H.H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, is currently here, receiving hospitality from the Belgian government. The Belgian evening newspaper recently inquired about the relationship between China and Japan. Dr. Kung replied that China is a peace-loving country, and its dealings with its neighbors are always characterized by patience. In recent months, some broad-minded politicians in Japan seem to have changed their attitude towards China. For example, important figures in the country's economic circles, led by Kenji Kodama, former President of the Yokohama Specie Bank, came to China to conduct inspections. We now hope that Japan's change of attitude is sincere. On the Chinese side, we are prepared to do everything possible to reach an understanding with Japan and work together in a spirit of friendship for peace in the Far East. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case today. In terms of economics, China is now prepared to cooperate with Japan and any other country, but with conditions, namely that this cooperation should be based on the principles of mutual benefit and equal rights. Dr. Kung then described China's progress in recent years, saying, "In the past ten years, under the wise leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, China has made rapid progress under the rule of the National Government. Political unity and financial stability are unprecedented achievements. As a member of the National Government, I feel deeply fortunate. The National Government is now outlining a new construction plan. China is prepared to accept assistance from any friendly country. China and Belgium have a long history of close cooperation, and we hope that this close cooperation can continue in the future." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)</p>
<h3>British Imperial Conference Discusses Far East Situation</h3>
<p>[London] The British Imperial Conference continued to meet this morning and issued a communiqué stating, "The Imperial Conference has continued to consider the situation in the Pacific and the Far East." Sources said that various issues in the Pacific have been discussed at length and will not be raised for discussion again in the future. British officials were tight-lipped about the proceedings of today's meeting. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 8th)</p>
<p>[London] As the British Imperial Conference nears its end, the work of its various committees has been completed. According to officials, the Constitutional Committee has submitted a report to the representatives attending the Imperial Conference, arguing that while the various parts of the British Empire retain the freedom to participate in various multilateral treaties, the various parts of the Empire are not bound by multilateral treaties signed by one part of the Empire. This proposal can facilitate the negotiations on the new Locarno Pact, because according to this method, the British government can participate in the Locarno Pact alone, without being hindered by the autonomous territories' reluctance to participate. In addition, the Economic Committee has also submitted a report, most of which consists of various economic statistics. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from 7th)</p>
<h3>North China Smuggling</h3>
<p>Affects British Trade with China; British Undersecretary Answers Member's Question</p>
<p>[London] British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne today answered a question from Conservative Member of Parliament Childe in the House of Commons, detailing the current state of smuggling in North China and its impact on British imports, and comparing it with the situation six months ago. Cranborne said that based on the information obtained, it can be seen that smuggling in North China is very rampant, and the volume of transactions has not decreased compared to the previous six months, especially in December and January. However, since January, there has been a sign of decline. Judging from the recent general phenomena, the trend of smuggling is expected to be slightly curbed. However, he has not yet made a comparable comparison of British imports to China. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from 7th)</p>

<h3>Platinum Blonde Movie Star Jean Harlow Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>Famous in the Film Industry for Playing Romantic Roles; At the Young Age of Twenty-Six, She Had Been Married Three Times</p>
<p>[New York] American film star Jean Harlow, known for her platinum blonde hair, suddenly died of cerebral edema in New York today at the young age of 26. Jean was born in Kansas City on March 3, 1911. In school, she was known for her talent for acting. Therefore, after graduating from Lake Forest School in Illinois, she went to Hollywood, the film capital of the United States. At that time, there were countless beautiful women seeking jobs outside the film companies, but Jean Harlow was uniquely noticed by the directors because of her silver-white hair, which was dazzling, and her clear green eyes, which were full of charm. It was as easy to get a contract as picking up a straw. Jean's family was wealthy. When she first entered the film industry, her grandfather strongly opposed it. Jean once dropped out of school because of this matter and stayed at home for several months. Finally, with the mediation of her kind mother, she was able to return to Hollywood. At first, she was only a supporting role for the hot girl Clara Bow. Later, she was appreciated by Howard Hughes, who selected her to be the protagonist of the film "Hell's Angels." From the release of this film, Jean became famous overnight, and Caddo Company signed a long-term contract with her. Other companies saw the emergence of new talent and rushed to recruit her. Jean became the most popular silver star in the film industry. Later, she was hired by the wealthy Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), which signed a long-term contract with her for seven years. "Personal Property," which was recently released in Shanghai, was actually the last film completed by Jean Harlow during her lifetime, because Jean had not yet finished filming "Saratoga," which she was starring in. Jean was married three times in her lifetime. When she married for the first time, she was only sixteen years old. Her husband was Charles McGrew, whom she first met at a school dance and later fell in love with. However, later, because Jean was determined to pursue photography, they agreed to divorce. Her second husband was Paul Bern, a big director at MGM. Two months after the marriage, news of Paul's suicide spread, shocking the entire United States. A year later, she married Harold Rosson, a famous photographer. Seven months later, they agreed to divorce. Recently, she was seen with William Powell, and it was said that the two had been engaged, but this could not be confirmed. Furthermore, Jean Harlow's hair was originally silver, but it was also dyed red.</p>
<p>⊙Hollywood. American vamp actress Jean Harlow died at 11:37 this morning at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. At the time of her death, her mother and stepfather, as well as her on-screen co-star William Powell, were by her side. According to friends' estimates, her estate should be worth one million dollars. When encoffined, the remains were dressed in all white, with her hair combed back, as she was usually seen on the screen. The funeral is scheduled for Wednesday and will be buried in the Crypt Mausoleum, where many deceased movie stars, such as Rudolph Valentino, are buried. (National dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>London Remains Silent; Manchester Guardian Expresses Astonishment</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the negotiations between England and Japan, the Japanese "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" newspaper published a report on the 21st of last month, stating that preliminary talks had concluded and formal negotiations were about to begin. The Manchester Guardian recently published an editorial expressing deep surprise at London's silence. The report stated: (According to the Mainichi Shimbun, England and Japan will cooperate in China and establish a friendly understanding. England's proposals regarding Central and Southern China will be recognized by Japan, but Japan requires England to recognize the "independence of Manchukuo" as a fait accompli and Japan's special interests in North China. All of this is what we imagine and fear. It is hard to believe that the British government could consider it. Regarding this matter, Foreign Secretary Eden is said to have provided assurances to Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, and China was thus reassured. However, the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations is now shrouded in secrecy, so it is no wonder that China still feels uneasy.) (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>British Monetary Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Simon States in the House of Commons</p>
<p>[London] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated in the House of Commons today that the British monetary policy announced by former Chancellor Chamberlain at the 1933 World Economic Conference and in the Anglo-French-American declaration last September remains unchanged to this day and will continue to do so in the future. The government has no intention of changing it. This policy does not involve Britain buying gold at a fixed price, but it does involve buying and selling gold to prevent inappropriate fluctuations in exchange rates. The implementation of the Anglo-French-American declaration has greatly satisfied the three countries, and there are currently no considerations to amend it.

<h3>London Market Gold Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>The Effectiveness of the Tripartite Agreement is Clearly Demonstrated</p>

<p>[New York] The New York Federal Reserve Bank announced that cash worth US$6,506,000 was shipped to the US today, all originating from the UK. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The market price of gold in London has begun to rebound. US Treasury Department and financial figures are satisfied, believing that this is a new achievement of the Anglo-French-American monetary agreement. Yesterday's gold sales in the London market were halved compared to last Saturday. The practical effectiveness of the tripartite agreement can once again be clearly demonstrated. The continued inflow of gold into the United States does not endanger the current US financial policy. It is believed that if England, France, and the Netherlands can cooperate with the United States, they have the power to buy up all the world's gold reserves. If all of these gold reserves can be bought up, the problem of stabilizing international currency through holding it will have a greater chance of success.

<h3>Movement for the Recovery of Lost Territories by Youths in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Harmonica Society Discovered; Over Ten People Imprisoned; Zhang "Wildcat" Qiyi Leads Troops in Northern Chahar</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent months, news of the unity and solidarity of our country has spread throughout the four northeastern provinces. Young people who have been suppressed and persecuted believe that the motherland has hope and are secretly engaged in collective activities to recover the lost territories. The new Kempeitai of the Japanese army in the puppet state is thus extremely busy with investigations and is extremely strict with the inspection of letters and telegrams. Last month, the Harbin Harmonica Society was inspected by the Japanese military police due to a communication from within the country. Anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese evidence was found, and more than ten people were arrested successively, including Chen Baoluo, a translator at the Atlantic Cinema, Liu Xingcheng, a teacher at the Municipal Second Girls' School, and Ren Baiou, a doctor at Binjiang Hospital. They were imprisoned in the Japanese Kempeitai headquarters and subjected to harsh torture to investigate accomplices. Dozens of young men and women, fearing implication, had already fled upon hearing the news. Since the Japanese Kempeitai was unable to capture them all at once, they interrogated the more than ten people who were arrested all day long. It is said that several people have already died from unbearable torture. However, despite the oppression and strict prevention by the Japanese and puppets, they still cannot stop the vigorous patriotic movement among the people. In the border area of Jilin and Heilongjiang, the righteous army, hearing about the preparations in the motherland to recover the lost territories, rose up in February to organize the righteous army and secretly arranged for internal support. Therefore, the Japanese and puppets are very panicked. On the one hand, they strictly prohibit the import of accurate news from China to incite the fellow countrymen in the Northeast; on the other hand, they prevent young people from the Northeast from coming to the country. In addition, they widely purchase traitors to detect anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu news and severely punish those involved in the patriotic movement. Therefore, the young people in the Northeast at this time are in a thorny situation, and every move they make lacks any freedom. Last month, righteous armies rose up in Northern Chahar and the border of Suiyuan and Mongolia, killing puppet officials and expelling the Japanese. Zhang Chengde, the former commander of the Northeast Cavalry Division, was originally a hero from the grasslands. In the past, he led a brigade of brave soldiers and roamed Inner Mongolia, nicknamed "Wildcat Zhang." His chivalrous behavior was admired by the people of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Mongolia. After retiring from the military, this gentleman lived in Northern Chahar. A month ago, he was supported by the various righteous armies and formed the Suiyuan-Chahar-Mongolia Border Defense Army, with him as the commander-in-chief. He gradually gathered more than two thousand people. Two weeks ago, he led troops to capture Huade Laideng Temple, burning puppet organs. In the Huade-Chongli area, only the county seat is still guarded by the Japanese and puppet troops. All the Mongolian banners outside the county seat have been recovered by Zhang's righteous army. This righteous army deeply hopes that the motherland will send troops to recover the lost territories and decides to take the lead. At present, it is raising funds to "preserve itself and seek survival" to resist the evil forces. The puppet Xing'an South Province and various counties on the Rehe border have also risen up and raised flags under the influence of the righteous army. Therefore, the unrest on the puppet border has become an undeniable fact. The headquarters of a certain army outside the pass felt that this matter was a major concern and believed that it would be impossible to succeed without cooperating with the headquarters of a certain army stationed in the country to deal with this issue. The headquarters of a certain army in the country also urgently wanted to have close contact with the army headquarters outside the pass to deal with everything. Based on this idea, the two parties secretly held a meeting in Changchun. On the 5th of this month, the commander of a certain army in the country secretly went to Shanhaiguan under the pretext of going to Qinyu and took a plane to Changchun early on the 6th and 8th to meet with the commander of the army outside the pass for detailed consultations.

<h3>The Situation in Northern Chahar Remains Serious</h3>
<p>The Uprising in Taotunmiao Village; A Certain Side's Surveillance of the People Becomes More Severe; Many People Are Detained and Massacred</p>
<p>Wanquan Correspondence: Although the self-defense act of the people in Northern Chahar has not achieved any results, it has had a significant impact on a certain side and the bandits and puppets, and has caused great shock to the morale of the people. In recent days, a certain side has paid special attention to all actions of the people, and the cruel methods of surveillance and oppression are even worse than before. Those who are slightly suspected are either detained or massacred immediately. Therefore, the morale of the people in each county is even more panic-stricken, and the situation is extremely serious. As for the course of this incident in Northern Chahar, according to people from Zhangbei, the main reason for the incident was indeed the people's indignation at the abuse by the puppet bandits. Unable to bear it any longer, they rose up in rebellion in order to defend themselves and strive for survival. In May, they had already started secretly activities and agreed to launch simultaneously in Zhangbei, Guyuan, Binchang, Kangbao, Shangdu, Huade Chongli and other counties on June 1. Unfortunately, the secret was leaked and heard by the puppet bandits and a certain side. On the night of May 30, the puppet bandits and a certain side first carried out a major inspection in Zhangbei City. The various counties followed suit. During the inspection in Zhangbei, any people (natives) from all walks of life who had served in the military and political circles before the 24th year of the Republic of China and are not currently employed by the bandits and puppets were uniformly detained if there was any suspicion. On the night, more than 200 people were detained. By June 1, nine of them had been killed. The leaders of the people who attempted to revolt were inevitably detained and brutally killed. However, the date of the official launch on June 1 has arrived, but the internal and external news is completely isolated, so most of the counties are hesitant and watching. Those who bravely took the risk of launching were also gradually cut off by a certain side with drastic measures by the third day. Recently, in Zhangbei City, in addition to more than a thousand puppet Mongolian troops, there are only more than 20 regular troops from a certain side. Since the incident, the troops have been on strict guard, and the work of guarding and sentry duty is all undertaken by themselves. This also shows their panic.</p>
<p>The self-defense of the people in Northern Chahar was initiated by Zhao of Taotunmiao Village, Chongli County. It is now known that Zhao, whose name is Xiangchun, was originally the village chief of Taotunmiao Village. At 2:00 AM on June 1, he personally led three baojia chiefs to sneak into nearby Shizuizi Village, confiscating the baojia and guns of the village. At the same time, several righteous people joined in, totaling more than ten people. After Zhao announced to the crowd the purpose of the uprising and the method of proceeding, they went together to the Taotunmiao Village Public Security Sub-station, specially killing the puppet director Wang Yaoguang and confiscating more than 20 guns from the puppet police. Before the incident, rumors were rife in Chongli County, saying that there would be changes in various places on June 1, and the puppet county government ordered all subordinates to be on alert. Because Taotunmiao Village is very close to Zhangyuan, Wang Yaoguang was ordered to pay special attention to the security of the village. Wang Yao had long been wary of Zhao Xiangchun and planned to detain Zhao first to prevent accidents. Zhao saw through his conspiracy and took the initiative to preemptively surround and kill Wang Yaoguang under the cover of the dark night. According to the village uprising, Chongli County sent more than 60 puppet security team members to the village on the 2nd. Zhao and others only had more than 30 guns and a shortage of bullets. After a slight resistance, they dispersed around 3:00 AM on the 3rd. The puppet security team detained many villagers afterwards. The team left a part in the village and returned to Chongli early on the 4th. It is said that Zhao and others are currently hiding in nearby villages and plan to rise up again after the puppet security team has left.</p>
<p>Sakakibara, a senior adviser to the puppet Huade Municipal Government, flew from Jiabusi to Changchun by plane at 1:00 PM on the 3rd to report the civil unrest in Northern Chahar to Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army and Chief of Staff Watanabe. That night, the military headquarters had telegraphed the heads of various special agencies to do their best to eradicate the people's forces, advised the internal personnel of the puppet state at all levels not to easily publicize the need to calm the situation, and telegraphed De Wang to quickly return to Jiabusi from Sonid Right Banner in Shanxi to suppress everything. It also said that when necessary, the Zhigui Army Brigade stationed in Rehe would be ordered to enter Northern Chahar to act as a support for the puppet bandits. Chief of Staff ×× would also fly to Duolun when necessary to command everything. As for the military pay of the puppet bandits, it will also be appropriately increased and ordered to be distributed to various units immediately after the funds arrive to appease the military.</p>
<p>The rebellious leader De Wang has always been immersed in the dream of the Renyuan Empire. Every month, a certain side supports him and allocates 270,000 yuan of puppet military and political expenses every month, all in the form of puppet Manchukuo paper money. This paper money can only be circulated within the sphere of influence of a certain force. Outside the scope, it is like ghost money. Any Mongolian with a little knowledge is ashamed. Recently, there were many people planning to secretly hold a meeting in Jiabusi to discuss persuading De Wang to reflect deeply and awaken early to avoid cutting himself off from the country and the nation, or to refuse to accept the support of a certain side. Even if the situation is unavoidable, they should refuse to accept the puppet money. This meeting is being convened, but it was broken by a certain side's detection. All the participants will be arrested and imprisoned and will be punished separately. (5th) One found central China Traffic Farmers Four Lines of five yuan • ten yuan • fake money one thousand six hundred Wu, when will the people and the stolen goods sent to the police station responsible for,</p>
<p>As for manufacturing, Minnan people with opium addiction originally only smoked opium. Occasionally, a small number of travelers and lower-class vagrants swallow opium bubbles and ointment for convenience and financial reasons, which is extremely rare. Strong drugs are even rarer. Recently, morphine, heroin, cocaine, Jindan, Hongwan, and other drugs have flowed in in large quantities and spread everywhere. The reason is that the price of opium is expensive, and the search is extremely strict. The weak-willed opium smokers are afraid of the trouble of registration. For convenience and economy, most of them switch to swallowing drugs. Although the increase rate of drugs in Xiamen City and Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Putian, and Xian counties in recent months cannot be counted, the lowest should account for more than 60% of opium smokers. The source of drugs starts from neighboring countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, and some are transferred from Shanghai. This year, with the strict prohibition of drugs, the smuggling of private goods has been intensified, but the Ronin secretly manufacture them on the spot. It is said that there are already four secret manufacturing agencies in Xiamen City that can be verified. In the mainland and offshore, there are also many secret drug manufacturing places. In Xiamen, those who run fierce drug items, in addition to citizens of a certain country and local ruffians attached to a certain country, among the Western medicine industry, there are also those who take advantage of the convenience of trafficking in drugs to do so (June 6).</p>

<h3>The Two Major Harms of Counterfeit Money and Drugs in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>—Both have a background of a certain country—</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, There are two major harms in southern Fujian recently, counterfeit money and drug production. Both of these have the background of a certain country. Counterfeit money in Fujian has become a serious problem in finance. Among them, the subsidiary currency of the Fujian Provincial Bank is the most common. The printing technology of the domestic currency is crude, so it is very easy to counterfeit. In the early days of the lithographic printing plate, there were many counterfeit banknotes, so the general use of one-corner coins was suspicious. After the engraving plate was changed, the counterfeiters specialized in making five-corner coins. In the previous month, the five-corner counterfeit coins were found in the inland areas of Minnan, Xiamen and Quanzhou. The Fuzhou garrison executed three traitors who were instigated to use counterfeit coins this year. The source of such counterfeit money is a certain island across the strait, along with smuggled goods, imported from Zhangquan offshore into the mainland, and some secretly imported from Xiamen. The Xiamen Water Police often finds a lot of search on passengers from the mainland who are going to the mainland, the lesser counterfeit than the central China traffic farmer four line method is less and the source is Shanghai or Hong Kong, too, a certain square person counterfeits the purpose is not limited to Fujian Province, on June 4, the Taiyuan wheeled from Shanghai to Xiamen by the Taikoo Steamboat Company The tenth team of the water police first received a report that a Ronin was secretly transporting a large number of counterfeit coins from Shanghai to Xiamen, so when Ganlun Mikoma Wharf secretly arranged for police detectives to rigorously search all the passengers landing from the land and water, he finally found Lu Mou in a small suitcase.</p>

<h3>Sea Yuan Vessel Salvage Details: Ship and Cargo Losses are Staggering</h3>
<p>Goods worth 500,000 were jettisoned into the sea. Small boats and barges made a fortune. Repairs are expected to be completed in a month for return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new Hai Yuan vessel ran aground on the morning of October 21st at the Hong Kong Kap Shui Mun lighthouse. The company dispatched Li Yunqu, head of the maritime affairs division, by airplane to Hong Kong to oversee the salvage efforts. It is now known that the ship has been rescued and taken to the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong. The combined losses from ship and cargo repairs are estimated to exceed 800,000 yuan. Yesterday, Li Yunqu, who oversaw the salvage, returned to Shanghai. A reporter inquired about the salvage situation. According to Mr. Li, he arrived on the afternoon of October 22nd. Taikoo Dockyard, responsible for the salvage, deployed over two hundred workers, including one chief technician in charge of salvage, two British divers, and six Chinese divers, to work on the ship. The location where the Hai Yuan ran aground was only two hundred feet from the foot of the mountain. Two rocks were beneath the ship's midsection near the engine room, one on the right side and one in the middle. When the Hai Yuan ran aground, it was secured to the mountain with four steel cables to prevent it from sinking. The breach in the first two holds was near the keel, measuring eleven feet long and four inches wide. The coal bunker had a fifteen-foot leak. The first two holds were completely flooded, causing all the cargo within to be submerged. From the 22nd to the 29th, until 9:00 AM, seven water pumps (two in the first hold, five in the second) were used day and night to pump water. Divers worked inside and outside the ship's hull to plug the leaks with wood wedges, hemp fibers, and caulking mats. Cement and wooden planks were used for patching. Two large barges were used to remove intact cargo from the third and fourth holds. The submerged cargo in the first two holds consisted of valuable items such as cotton yarn, textiles, silk crepe, general merchandise, and white rice. The salvage chief ordered all of this cargo to be jettisoned into the sea because the bow was deeply submerged, with the deck level with the sea surface, while the stern rose high (as shown in the image). After the cargo from the two holds was thrown overboard, the coal bunker was emptied, and some coal was also dumped into the sea. On the 27th, the rocks shifted under the second hold, causing more severe leakage, which the pumps could not handle. At this point, the salvage engineers were extremely alarmed. After consultation, it was decided to first drag the stern of the Hai Yuan off the rocks to prevent the bottom of the ship from being further damaged, averting extreme danger. However, during the towing, the towboat's propeller became entangled in the cable, nearly causing it to run aground and be destroyed. Only after switching to a second towboat was the ship pulled fifteen feet away from the rocks. The ship listed by fifteen degrees, an extremely precarious situation. Fortunately, it was low tide, and the leaks in the two holds were sealed, averting disaster. By the 28th, the work of sealing the coal bunker leaks with caulking mats was completed. Simultaneously, the leaks on the outside of the ship were also repaired. After an entire night of pumping, by 9:00 AM on the 29th, the water level in the first two holds had gradually decreased to about seven feet. The entire process took six days and seventeen hours. At 9:20 AM that morning, a massive tarpaulin was used to wrap the bottom of the Hai Yuan's first two holds. Finally, three large towboats were used to pull the ship backwards off the rocks, completely freeing it. It was towed backwards all the way to the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong, with the ship listing eleven degrees to the right to relieve pressure on the damaged bow. At 11:45 AM, it was safely towed into the dock. The ship is now being supervised by Zhou Houfu, a technician dispatched by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, for repairs, estimated to take about a month before it can be completed and returned to Shanghai. According to a crew member who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, when the cargo from the Hai Yuan's first two holds was jettisoned into the sea, because both holds contained high-value goods, dozens of small boats and barges from Hong Kong went to Kap Shui Mun lighthouse to salvage the items. These vessels were fully loaded and overjoyed. It is now estimated that the jettisoned cargo was worth about 500,000 yuan, while ship repair costs and lost charter fees add up to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, the total loss from the Hai Yuan incident, including both cargo and ship, is estimated to be over 800,000 yuan. Insurance companies that underwrote the cargo insurance have dispatched personnel to Hong Kong to thoroughly investigate the details of the incident.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Resumes Sichuan Shipping: Jinjiang to be Launched</h3>
<p>Launching on the 26th of this month, joint operations with Yihua from June 1, resumption after more than four years of suspension.</p>
<p>The Sichuan River route of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been suspended since the accident of the Emei vessel, for more than four years. During these four years, it was a time of congestion in the transport of Sichuan goods, and the water freight rates soared, some increasing to about nine times. The company watched with envy the huge profits earned by companies such as Minsheng, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Sanbei. Last winter, it began planning to restore the Sichuan route in order to help connect the transport of goods to and from the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It thoroughly transformed the salvaged Emei vessel and presented it to the Ministry for approval. It was decided to completely rebuild the hull of the Emei, adopt the latest style and enlarge the hull, while the engine would still be the Emei's. Everything was entrusted to Jiangnan Shipyard for construction. The construction cost of the hull alone was 380,000 yuan. The interior of the vessel was elaborately designed to the most magnificent and luxurious standard. The grand dining room and first-class rooms all used Simmons beds, and the third- and fourth-class cabins were equipped with ventilation, dining halls, water heating in winter, and fans in summer. It surpassed Minsheng Company's Mintai and Minben first-class vessels. The vessel was named Guijiang, meaning that this vessel would become a "state-run mail ship in the Sichuan River." Because of the urgency to resume the Shanghai-Chongqing route, Jiangnan Shipyard was hired to expedite the construction, and engineers were sent from the company to the shipyard to supervise the construction. All the work on the vessel has been completed. Yesterday, the shipyard notified the company that it was scheduled to officially hold the launching ceremony on the 26th of this month. The company has reported to the Ministry and requested that the Ministry send a special commissioner to Shanghai to attend the launching ceremony of the Jinjiang vessel. It is also possible that Minister Yu will personally attend. On that day, the company will invite all sectors of Shanghai and abroad to participate in the ceremony at Gaochang Temple. After the launch, it will immediately speed up the installation of all levels of seats in order to start shipping passengers and goods to and from Shanghai and Sichuan on a regular basis. In order to facilitate the Sichuan merchants, the company has agreed with Yihua Company that all goods bound for Sichuan will be jointly transported by Yihua above Yichang, and all goods from Yichang to Shanghai will be transported by the company's river vessels. This has been implemented since June 1st. Therefore, the Sichuan navigable transport that has been interrupted for several years will first accept joint transport from June 1st.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Local Association Holds Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Correcting Errors in Land Value Tax Bills</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Local Association convened its seventh board meeting at its Duojia Road clubhouse at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than ten people, including Qin Yanqi, Zhang Jingye, Wu Lüping, Wang Chengyao, Liu Donghai, and Kang Luqiao, attended. Qin Yanqi chaired the meeting, Lu Mujun took notes, and the usual formalities were observed. The meeting involved a report of matters (omitted) and resolutions on the following cases: ㊀ The association's four district branches reported that "the second phase of land value tax notices from the Land Administration Bureau still lack Baojia household information, making distribution difficult in various towns and villages. Acreage discrepancies persist, bundled bills remain merged as before, and municipal improved land levies have not been reduced. A general assembly should be convened to decide on these issues." Requesting discussion on the matter. ㊁ Regarding the second phase of land value tax in this county, which has already begun, the assessed land values still do not conform to the figures agreed upon by local people convened by the county government. How should this be handled? The above two cases were discussed together, and it was resolved: A. The county government issued a proclamation on May 26, following a provincial order, entrusting the Land Administration Bureau to handle the matter according to the law. What legal basis did the bureau use to assess the new land values? B. Why did the county government only announce the newly assessed land values by the Land Administration Bureau twenty days after the levy began? C. At the sixth board meeting of this association on January 3, 1937, it was resolved that land value tax notices contained many errors, and a request was submitted to the county government to order corrections. Subsequently, on January 13 of the same year, the county government issued instruction No. 1314, stating that the matter was noted and that the first phase of the 1936 land value tax notices failed to include Baojia household information, causing distribution difficulties. The County Land Administration Bureau was ordered to include this information separately when processing the second phase of land value tax registers and to investigate and correct any errors found. Based on the previous report, it was requested that the bureau be instructed again to make separate corrections. However, the contents of the second phase of land value tax notices did not comply with the order for correction. Regarding the above three points, the county government is requested to order corrections. ㊂ (Omitted) ㊃ Should the county government be requested to hold the County Administrative Meeting regularly, as it has not been convened for a long time? The resolution passed. After the discussions, the meeting adjourned for refreshments.</p>
<h3>Measures for Levying Income Tax on Public Bond Mortgages</h3>
<p>All Previously Mortgaged Bonds Exempted; Interest on Other Bonds Payable</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has submitted to the Executive Yuan the collection measures for income tax on interest from government agency mortgage loans and public bonds, and has specially requested the Jiangsu Provincial Government to review and refer to them, attaching the collection measures for reference. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Official Dispatch: The Ministry of Finance, in a dispatch to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stated: Regarding your government's telegrams of December last year and April this year, inquiring whether income tax can be exempted on price bonds not yet issued and deposited in banks as loan guarantees, and requesting a prompt reply to proceed accordingly; Your request is approved. According to the Public Bond Regulations, once announced, the issuance date is clearly defined. Although the bond certificates are still held by the issuing agency, their entitlement to principal and interest is the same as that of general bondholders, and cannot be considered unissued. However, the income tax on public bond interest began to be levied on October 1, 1936, after the approval of the 1936 expenditure budget for government agencies. This tax was not included in the budget and lacks funding, which presents practical difficulties. A relief measure was proposed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan convened a review committee to examine the measure and submitted it for approval. The Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 2326 on April 24 of this year, stating: The 309th meeting of this Yuan decided to adopt the review opinion on the report jointly submitted by the ministry and other bodies regarding the relief measure for income tax on interest from public bonds mortgaged by government agencies. The case is recorded and reported to the National Government for filing and is also notified for compliance. A copy of the review committee's record is attached for your ministry to comply with. This order, along with a copy of the corresponding review opinion, is sent to your government. Please review and list the names, numbers, amounts, mortgage dates, interest amounts, total tax amounts, and debt repayment deadlines of the above-mentioned mortgaged bonds in detail and reply so that we can handle the matter accordingly. This is sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for the collection measures. This case was returned for further review, and the original proposed measures A and B were discussed in detail. The original proposed measure B used the actual issuance of public bonds as the standard for tax payment. This type of boundary is extremely difficult to determine because once the public bond regulations are announced, the issuance date is clearly defined. Although the bond certificates are still held by the issuing agency, their entitlement to principal and interest is the same as that of general bondholders and cannot be considered unissued. Furthermore, mortgage methods vary, with some being fully mortgaged, some partially mortgaged, and some changing the mortgage quantity at any time. Investigation and registration procedures are very cumbersome. If this is used as the tax standard, it will cause great difficulties for the collection agencies and is practically impossible to implement. The original proposed measure A is supplemented to take both facts into consideration and submitted to the Yuan for review and approval. Revised measure A: Before this case is approved, all bonds that have been mortgaged by various issuing agencies before debt settlement will be exempt from income tax. If tax has been levied, it will be refunded. (The tax exemption and refund should be reported to the Ministry of Finance by each agency with the bond number, amount, mortgage date, interest amount, and total tax amount for approval.) Interest from the remaining bonds should be subject to income tax. If the tax on interest from mortgaged public bonds affects loan usage, the issuing agencies can list it separately in the budget.</p>
<h3>Li Shaoduo Telegraphs Report on Disaster Inspection in Western Henan</h3>
<p>All That Is Heard Is Selling Wives and Children; Nothing but Tree Leaves and Wild Grass</p>
<p>The joint disaster relief association of charitable organizations in this city received a telegram yesterday from Li Shaoduo, the investigation and relief commissioner of Henan, reporting on his inspection of various counties in western Henan. (Omitted titles) Li Shaoduo arrived in western Henan on the 29th of last month to inspect the area. He found a vast expanse of barren land and displaced disaster victims. He thought that after a large amount of emergency relief, the disaster victims would still be able to survive. The two rainfalls last month increased his sense of security. He fully expected that this trip would bring a change for the better. Who knew that the urgency of relief was even greater than before, two to three times greater than in March and April? Besides the starving disaster victims, half of the disaster victims, although their possessions were exhausted, could still buy grain by selling daily necessities, tattered clothes, and eat tree leaves and grass roots boiled into soup to survive. Now, the mountains and rivers are exhausted. All the disaster victims have nothing to fill their stomachs except stone powder, tree leaves, wild grass, and rough bran. Those who had a sallow complexion in the past now have sunken bellies and exposed ribs, or they are as thin as dried corpses and have transformed into skeletons. Every village and city he passed, all he heard was reports of selling wives and daughters and abandoning or killing children. Even with this emergency relief, the affected area is so vast and the number of disaster victims is so large that those who receive relief account for less than one in ten. Although the autumn crops have emerged from the soil, it will be more than three months before they can be eaten. Their lives are hanging by a thread and cannot wait long. He humbly begs all of you to quickly gather large sums of money to continue saving lives and resurrect the dead. This merit will last for generations. This telegram expresses the utmost urgency. Respectfully, Li Shaoduo, investigator and relief commissioner for the drought in Henan. It is also reported that the Ministry of Finance has allocated 120,000 in work relief funds to Henan Province, and the Shanghai branch of the China Bank has telegraphed the Henan branch to allocate and distribute the funds.</p>
<h3>Report on the Implementation of Work Relief in Dengfeng, Henan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Jisheng Association and the Sino-Foreign Relief Society have completed emergency relief in Dengfeng and have begun implementing work relief. We have received a report from Mao Rucai, the magistrate of Dengfeng County, along with two printed receipts. One work relief receipt states that 18,889 relief tickets were received, totaling 55,937 yuan in relief funds. In addition, grain and wheat were distributed to disaster victims in the city, totaling 869 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. This includes 54 bags of relief rice and 3 shi, 2 dou, 5 sheng, and 4 he of wheat, totaling 56,806 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. In addition, 4,193 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 fen of work relief funds were used. Excluding relief expenses, the total is 61,000 yuan. The distributions by both associations were supervised by local officials and county government personnel on-site, benefiting the people in a practical way. The magistrate issued printed receipts in the correct amounts to show good faith. Work relief is just beginning and is the start of water conservancy in Dengfeng, which is being carried out with real effort and is not yet completed. The relief funds remitted to Dengfeng by both associations for emergency relief have been exhausted. The work relief funds will be disbursed successively according to the progress of the project. However, the relief funds from Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and other provinces for the Jisheng Association are meager and insufficient. We still hope that benevolent people will continue to contribute generously. We have already allocated relief medicine to Sichuan and Henan provinces.</p>
<h3>American Red Cross Concerned About Chinese Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Remitted Funds to the Sino-Foreign Relief Society</p>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Society reports that the severe drought in Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, Guizhou, and other provinces has caused extreme suffering to the people. In addition to sending personnel to various disaster areas for relief, the association has also been appealing in newspapers to raise relief funds. It has been learned that the American Red Cross has repeatedly raised funds and remitted them to the association for distribution, and has stated that more remittances are coming. This shows the concern of the United States for the Chinese disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Cancellation of Yesterday's Student Disaster Relief Variety Show</h3>
<p>Prohibition by the French Concession Police; Remedial Measures to Be Discussed on the 10th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Student Disaster Relief Variety Show was originally scheduled to hold variety show fundraising performances at 2:00 PM and 7:30 PM yesterday and today, with all proceeds to be sent to disaster-stricken compatriots. In recent days, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically purchased tickets, and it was expected that the results would be satisfactory. Yesterday morning, the association's affairs were all arranged, and representatives from various schools responsible for the venue also arrived at the Yameng Grand Theater on Songshan Road. Unexpectedly, the French Concession Police believed that the plays must contain patriotic meanings and prohibited the performance. After clarifying that it had been approved by the authorities and contained no anti-Japanese implications, and that the matter was purely for disaster relief with no other connections in fact, the police still did not allow it. The association, caught off guard, has now scheduled a meeting at 1:00 PM on the 10th at the Qingnian Middle School on Sichuan Road to convene various schools, discuss remedial measures, and reschedule the event. They deeply apologize to the ladies and gentlemen who enthusiastically purchased tickets for their wasted trip.</p>
<h3>Chinese Insurance Companies to Jointly Form Reinsurance Organization</h3>
<p>Chinese life insurance companies in our country have never had a formal joint reinsurance organization. Therefore, there are occasional cases where the remaining amount is reinsured with foreign companies, resulting in the outflow of rights and interests. People with good intentions are concerned about this. The life insurance group of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association has also seen this problem and held a meeting at the association at 10:00 AM on the 8th of this month to discuss the reinsurance issues of Chinese life insurance companies. It is proposed that the member companies of the insurance group of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association jointly organize a reinsurance organization with a fixed capital of 200,000 yuan. It is now being started and will be realized in the future. Then the Chinese life insurance business will have no worries about the loss of rights and interests or the outflow of resources.</p>

<h3>Post Office Adds Automobiles to Deliver Parcels</h3>
<p>Temporary Delivery Measures in Place</p>
<p>Postal parcels have traditionally required recipients to go to the post office to pick them up. The Shanghai Postal Administration, in order to facilitate the public, has purchased two covered vans since June 1, 1937, to initiate door-to-door delivery services for domestic parcels. It is learned that the post office, seeing that this service is developing daily and that the original vehicles are insufficient, has purchased two more similar vehicles, scheduled to be put into use on the 10th of this month. At that time, the bureau will have four large special vehicles, departing together at 9:00 AM every day to deliver all door-to-door parcels sent to Shanghai from all over the country as quickly as possible. For parcels sent by mailers, the delivery fee is one jiao per item, and the recipient can enjoy this convenience. If the mailer has not prepaid the delivery fee, the recipient can include the parcel pick-up slip (i.e., the notification slip) along with the delivery fee of one jiao per item in an envelope with the words "Postal Official Business" written on the cover and send it free of charge to the Parcel Delivery Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration. The post office can also send someone to deliver the parcel to the address. However, insured parcels, cash-on-delivery parcels, and those requiring customs clearance or tax payment are not included in this service.</p>

<h3>Yarn Brokers Secretly Withhold Payment for Goods as Speculation Margin</h3>
<p>Suspect Arrested and Investigated After Victim Reported to the Police; Court Orders Rescheduled Hearing in One Week</p>
<p>Japanese national Morioka Asakichi operates a yarn business at No. 18 Miller Road under the name Japanese Maritime Transportation Company. He hired Jiang Bingsheng, a local resident, as a bird broker. On the morning of the third of this month, at 9:00 AM, Jiang told Morioka that Guangzengxiang Yarn Shop at No. 7, Alley 4, Tianjin Road, intended to purchase 22 bales of cotton yarn (valued at 9,352.42 yuan). He requested that a warehouse receipt be issued immediately, as the payment could not be made until 11:00 AM due to the banks not being open at the time. Morioka, because Guangzengxiang had a long history of transactions and had never been short on payments, did not suspect anything and issued the warehouse receipt. However, by 4:00 PM, Jiang had not paid the amount, and Jiang's whereabouts were also unknown. Morioka then inquired with Guangzengxiang and was informed that the payment had been made by the company to Jiang Bingsheng with a Guohua Bank cashier's check. Morioka immediately reported to the General Police Department. Hua detective Geng Deru's investigation revealed that Jiang had given the cashier's check to Qin Chuan Yarn Shop at No. 229, Zhonghui Building, Aiduya Road, as a margin for his standard cotton yarn trading. A plan was devised for Guangzengxiang to stop payment with the bank, and Jiang was put under strict surveillance. Finally, at 1:40 AM yesterday, Hua detective Yang Peisheng discovered Jiang's whereabouts in Room 69 of the Pinxiang Hotel at No. 270 Yuqiaqing Road and rushed to arrest him. Subsequently, a search of the residence of Jiang's concubine's mother at No. 221 Beihai Road yielded 425 yuan in cash, a China and South Bank savings passbook with 600 yuan, a Yongda Bank savings passbook with a balance of over 16 yuan, and a checkbook, which were all brought back to the police station. At around 9:00 AM, Jiang was sent to the Special Court's First Criminal Tribunal, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated him. The police attorney Ru Baoyi explained the previous circumstances and charged Jiang with embezzlement under Article 236, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and stated that the defendant had been sentenced to three months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence by this court for forgery in May last year and was still within the probation period. He has now committed a similar crime, and the investigation of this case is not yet complete. The court should allow a rescheduling, etc. Then, Morioka Asakichi testified and interrogated Jiang Bingsheng. Jiang Bingsheng confessed that, according to the trading practices between me and the plaintiff, the plaintiff first issues a warehouse receipt and gives it to the client, and the amount paid by the client is paid to the plaintiff by me at 5:00 PM. The amount paid by Guangzengxiang this time was transferred by me as a margin for standard cotton yarn trading. I originally planned to pay the plaintiff after settling the accounts at 5:00 PM, but I could not fulfill the plan due to a loss of several hundred yuan. However, the cashier's check has already been paid and collected by the plaintiff, etc. After Judge Feng verified the confession, he ordered that the case be rescheduled for one week.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Grand Theater Scheduled to Reopen</h3>
<p>[Same introductory line repeated]</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road, which was vandalized by angry sailors after showing a film about Abyssinia, has announced a temporary closure. Now that the theater has completed its internal repairs, it is scheduled to reopen on the 11th of this month. The first film to be shown has been set as the famous Soviet film "Kronstadt."</p>
<h3>Film Industry Opposes Anti-China Films</h3>
<p>Ever since the Japanese-owned Toa Cinema began showing the Japanese-German co-produced film "New Land," all sectors have expressed indignation, believing the film shows contempt for our national territorial sovereignty and insults the nation's dignity. It is learned that the Motion Picture Producers Association of this city believes that it is all the more necessary for the film industry to strive to prevent the public showing of anti-China films by Japanese merchants in Shanghai. It has been decided to raise the issue for discussion during the inauguration ceremony of the newly elected executive and supervisory committee members at the Pudong Mansion Club at 5:00 PM on the 14th of this month, in order to express a serious stance and encourage the other party to realize their mistake.</p>
<h3>Passenger on New Ning Shao Steamer Jumps into Sea, Leaving Farewell Letter to Wife</h3>
<p>Fang Guangtian Commits Suicide by Jumping into Sea Due to Illness; Another Passenger Jumps into Sea on Ningxing Steamer</p>
<p>The New Ning steamer sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 4th of this month. Another passenger jumped into the sea, leaving behind two letters filled with poignant words. The sentiments expressed are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea near Tongsha</p>
<p>The New Ning Shao steamer set sail from the 16th Wharf at 5:00 PM on the 4th. Around 8:00 PM, as the ship left the Wusongkou and neared the waters of Tongsha, a passenger suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide. Later, the steward Wang Zuhuang discovered that the passenger was received by him and was about thirty years old, wearing a gray lined spring shirt, a wool robe, and a felt hat, with a Ningbo accent. Upon inspecting his berth, a cloth robe was found, and in its pocket were two letters, one addressed to his wife and the other to his father-in-law, both bearing the name Fang Guangtian, which is presumed to be the name of the deceased.</p>
<p>Letter to His Wife</p>
<p>The letter addressed to his wife gave the address as No. 28 Yian Lane, Chengdu Road, Shanghai. The steward of the ship delivered the letter to the address. The letter to his wife is recorded as follows: "My beloved wife, please forgive me. I am in too much pain, so I am committing suicide. I know my illness is deep-rooted, and dragging it on will only burden you. It is better to leave early and spare you the suffering. However, I know your heart will ache, but there is nothing I can do. In the future, please do not dwell on it too much. When I left home, I was overwhelmed with sadness. I wanted to die for your sake, but when I thought of my illness, I had no choice but to die. Please forgive me. Do not forget my instructions. Take good care of my parents-in-law. If you want to go back to Cixi to live, you can. I have written a letter to my brother, entrusting him to take care of you. Farewell forever, farewell forever. A letter to my parents-in-law is enclosed. Please present it to them. Fang Guangtian, Sixth Month, Fourth Day."</p>
<p>Another Jumps into the Sea</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday afternoon, a passenger on the Ninghai steamer of the Sanbei Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 5th of this month, jumped into the sea. The passenger, about thirty years old, bareheaded, wearing a green-gray Western suit, speaking with a Shanghai accent and without luggage, was in a small cabin on the left side of the ship on the third floor. At 6:00 PM that evening, as the ship was sailing through the Wusongkou, the passenger immediately climbed over the railing from the berth and jumped into the sea and committed suicide. Because there was no suicide note, the reason for the suicide is unknown.</p>
<h3>Gang Gathers Thugs to Force Dissolution of Marriage Contract, Husband Angrily Kills Wife</h3>
<p>Woman Suffers Eleven Knife Wounds, Life in Critical Condition; Husband Explains Reasons in Detail</p>
<p>Long Heshang, a 31-year-old resident of Pudong, used to work as a sailor on a tugboat for the British-owned Tsang Tak-fung Tug &amp; Lighter Co., but has been unemployed for many years and makes a living by selling vegetables. His home is located at No. 22, East End, Wu Family Hall, Pudong. His wife, Yao Jinmei, is currently 14 years old and works as a female worker at the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Lujiazui. The couple has been married for five years and has a four-year-old son. However, Long is by nature weak and an honest country bumpkin, and has not won his wife's favor, so the relationship between the two is weak. Yao has even returned to her mother's home in Meiyuan, Changzhan since September of the previous year and has not returned to this day, nearly two years. Recently, she gathered several thugs to force Gong to sign a document dissolving the marriage contract. Gong was stimulated by this, coupled with rumors that his wife was having an affair. Under this dual pressure, he developed deadly thoughts. At 6:00 PM the night before, he hid a kitchen knife and waited for Yao as she was about to leave work at the crossroads of Tobacco Factory Road and Tomb Mountain Road. When Yao left the factory with the crowd and arrived at the spot, Gong rushed into the crowd without asking any questions, pushed Yao to the ground, and slashed wildly with the knife. Yao suffered one knife wound above her right ear, splitting the ear skin in two, two knives below her right ear, three knives on the top of her head, one knife on the back of her neck plus one knife, one knife on the left shoulder, and two knives on her arm. Blood flowed all over the ground. At the time, Yao struggled fiercely, so Gong himself also cut his left arm and slipped and fell to the ground, his face scraped by the stone road. At this time, the guard at the entrance of the Tobacco Factory had already arrived and Gong still tried to raise the knife to continue slashing, but was stopped by the guard using a wooden stick to knock the knife from his hand. The guard then apprehended him and sent him to the Pudong Branch for disposal. Yao was rushed to Pudong Hospital for treatment. The wounds were found to be deep, about three inches long. She was dizzy and after a dose of cardiac stimulant, she gradually woke up. After the wounds were sewn up, she was transferred to Renji Hospital that night. Her condition was severe, and she was still in critical condition yesterday. As for the perpetrator Gong Heshang, he was interrogated by Branch Chief Zhang yesterday, and he spoke in detail about the reasons for his actions. The Branch Chief ordered him to be sent to the local court for prosecution in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Expulsion of Vegetable Stalls on Fuyou Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the vegetable stalls on Fuyou Road were expelled by the police. After investigation by reporters, the details of this case are as follows: The vegetable stalls in the eastern section of Fuyou Road, because they had not obtained donation licenses and were not arranged neatly, obstructed traffic in that section. As early as the end of last year and mid-April of this year, the Municipal Police Bureau, based on the decisions of the Municipal Government's various bureaus, ordered the relevant Yimiao Police Station to carry out the crackdown. The vegetable vendors in that area initially complied and withdrew, but before long, they arbitrarily set up stalls again. On the morning of May 8, when the station chief was ordered to carry out the crackdown, the stall vendors gathered more than 100 people and went to the station, demanding to set up stalls as usual. Although they were persuaded to disperse, they still set up stalls arbitrarily as before. It is now heard that the police bureau, in order to rectify the city's appearance and take into account the livelihood of the peddlers, will still implement reasonable crackdown measures.</p>
<h3>Fire at Yan Hai Road This Morning</h3>
<p>The Jutang Sauce Garden, located at No. 3, 4, 5, and 7 Yanhai Road in the city, suddenly caught fire at 0:05 this morning on the facade of the No. 2 building, and immediately spread to the No. 4, 5, and 7 buildings. Flames soared into the air and the situation was dire. The nearby police officers were notified and immediately reported to the Fire Brigade, which dispatched fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire, preventing it from spreading. After about half an hour, the fire was completely extinguished, but the four buildings of the sauce garden had been completely destroyed, resulting in considerable losses. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police station.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Weather Was Cool and Pleasant After the Rainstorm the Day Before</h3>
<p>The Seasons Can Change in a Day. On the 4th, the city was sweltering, with the temperature rising to 97.2 degrees, breaking the highest record for this year. In the afternoon, there was a heavy rainstorm, which swept away the heat. Yesterday morning, the weather was even cooler, like early spring. Compared with the scorching weather the day before, it was like a change of seasons. Residents felt a sense of coolness after the scorching heat.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru and Others' Reply (2)</h3>
<p>Although the indictment lists as many as ten counts of criminal evidence, it is nothing more than taking the various documents of the National Salvation Association out of context, piecing them together, distorting the meaning of resisting the external enemy as a desire to seize internally. It does not provide a holistic view of the facts and evidence in this case, resulting in fragmentation and obscuring the truth. Moreover, it lacks understanding of the international situation and the content of national policy. In order to expose the fallacies, we will reply to the ten counts one by one as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The indictment claims in the first count that the defendants intentionally obstructed the central government's national policy of eradicating the Red menace, citing two phrases in the declaration of the National Salvation Association of All Circles as evidence. However, upon investigation, (A) the phrase "The National Salvation Association of All Circles' declaration contains 'The major powers' attack on the Soviet Union is a mistake, and China's suppression of the Communists is also a mistake,'" is marked with quotation marks to indicate direct quotation, but no such phrase can be found in the declaration. This is astonishing. Upon reviewing the letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to the Inspection and Study Department of the Judiciary, it was found that this phrase was included in it. The indictment simply copied its error. It is unexpected that the indictment, after four months of investigation, has not even carefully reviewed the original text of the National Salvation Association's documents. If one end is like this, the rest can be imagined. Furthermore, the similar but different point in the declaration is: "In the four years and eight months, the Western powers, under the erroneous policy of supporting Japanese imperialism's attack on the Soviet Union, have fatally threatened their interests in the Far East. Our pro-Japanese bureaucrats, under the erroneous policy of tolerating Japanese imperialism's establishment of a base for attacking the Soviet Union in the Northeast and dreaming of establishing an international anti-Communist alliance with Japan, have almost cut off the lifeline of the entire country," (see page 2 of the declaration). The so-called mistake of attacking the Soviet Union clearly refers to the Western powers' misbelief in Japan's smokescreen of attacking the Soviet Union, resulting in the loss of interests in the Far East. The so-called mistake of anti-communism clearly refers to the dream of being able to ally with Japan to oppose communism, which may result in the country being destroyed by the Japanese before communism can be opposed. Furthermore, the first paragraph of the declaration states, "In the four years and eight months, Japanese imperialism, on the one hand, used the smokescreen of establishing a military base to attack the Soviet Union to deceive the European and American powers, and on the other hand, used the trap of a joint anti-communism to deceive our authorities, taking the opportunity to annex our six provinces of 1.68 million square kilometers and enslave 60 million compatriots," (see page 1). The last page of the declaration states, "Do not listen to the sweet words of Japanese imperialism and attempt to sacrifice China to launch a war against the Soviet Union in the Far East." Reading the front and back together makes the meaning clearer. (B) As for the indictment, in the same count, it also cites the phrase "A few people with ulterior motives still believe that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party are the main enemies of the Chinese nation," on the second page of the declaration, as the second argument. The meaning of this phrase is still the same as the above, that is, the main enemy of the Chinese nation is Japan, which aims to destroy us. If the indictment does not deny that Japan is our country's main enemy, it cannot make any accusations against the above phrase. Judging from the various phrases quoted in the documents cited in the first count of the indictment, it can be seen that the discussion of whether it is wise to ally with Japan to attack the Soviet Union and oppose communism is purely based on the point of resisting Japan, and does not touch on the attack on the Soviet Union and the anti-communism themselves. The National Salvation Association arose for the sake of resisting Japan, and the Soviet communist issue other than resisting Japan was originally unrelated to the purpose of the association. The indictment did not pay attention to the words about resisting Japan in the sentence and the meaning of the so-called delusion, so its attacks are inherently baseless. Furthermore, the Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Agreement was repeatedly proposed by the Japanese side during the Sino-Japanese negotiations last fall and winter, but the government has always firmly rejected it, which shows that the National Salvation Association's views on this point are not at all in conflict with the government's measures. Moreover, the declaration of the Third Plenary Session clearly states, "As for internal affairs, peaceful reunification has been the common creed of the whole country for several years. Only through reunification can a modern country be built, so as to bear the great responsibility of saving the country and preserving its existence. Only through peace can everyone know that they should unite sincerely and face the difficulties together, so as to achieve true reunification. The interests of the entire nation ultimately outweigh the interests of all individuals and all groups," etc. The resolution of the Third Plenary Session on eradicating the Red menace states that it yearns for a world of great harmony and has no parochial views on domestic affairs, but only seeks to gather the strength of China and lay the foundation for unification. "Regarding the Communist Party, the party takes love as its heart and will never cut off the path for people to reform themselves," etc., which is enough to prove that the central government's national policy is no different from the meaning of the phrases contained in the declaration of the National Salvation Association of All Circles. The indictment claims that the defendants intentionally obstructed the central government's national policy of eradicating the Red menace based on this phrase, but in reality, it does not clearly understand what the central government's national policy is. (2) The indictment claims in the second count that the defendants do not recognize the current government as having the power to rule and want to organize another government outside the current government, based on the following points:</p>
<p>(A) The National Salvation Association of All Circles' declaration suggests the release of political prisoners. However, the Second Plenary Session and the Third Plenary Session both had this proposal. The Third Plenary Session has already passed the principle. President Jiang also said in a conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency after the Third Plenary Session, "There are many examples of leniency and exemption for those who have committed political mistakes in the past," and clearly stipulated the conditions for amnesty, showing that it was even more specific. The indictment uses this as the basis for determining that the defendants do not recognize the ruling power of the current government and want to organize another government, but it is unknown how it interprets the central government's proposal and resolution on this matter. (B) The indictment uses the declaration of the National Salvation Association of All Circles, which states that the congress suggests that all parties and factions should immediately send representatives to negotiate, formulate a common program for resisting the enemy, and establish a unified anti-enemy regime, and the political program, which states that we need to quickly establish a unified national salvation regime, as evidence that the current government's ruling power is not recognized and that another government is to be established. Its error lies in confusing the regime with the government. It is well known that the government is the institution of the state, while the regime is the power exerted by this institution. Therefore, the same government can exert different powers, and the change in its power does not affect its organization. For example, after the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, the central government's regime expanded, but the organization did not change in the slightest, which is clear evidence. When the National Salvation Association of All Circles issued the declaration and political program, the domestic situation still had the appearance of separation between various parties. The National Salvation Association, in view of the imminent foreign aggression, issued a call for internal unity. Since the government has peaceful unification in mind, how can it be used as a basis for conviction? As for "unified anti-enemy regime" and "unified national salvation regime," "anti-enemy" and "national salvation" are the unanimous demands of the people, (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Thorough Rectification of Wharf by China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>Implement Arrest of Thieves to Eliminate Long-Standing Malpractices; Dismiss Security Personnel to Increase Wages and Fundamentally Reform</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Bureau, in order to thoroughly rectify the order of the Jinliyuan Wharf, has dismissed all of the original security personnel. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the Jinliyuan Wharf has always been a den of thieves, and the security personnel rarely reported any crimes. The bureau is implementing the government's rectification plan and is determined to eliminate long-standing malpractices. The previous screening of security personnel and the recent decision to dismiss all security personnel are all for the purpose of reform. Since the employment of the petition police last month, many cases of theft have been discovered under strict supervision and have been sent to the Second Special Zone Court for punishment. This kind of arrest and punishment of thieves is unprecedented, which shows that the reform has achieved practical results. As for the petition police hired by the bureau from the court and police station, they are directly commanded by the bureau, and their employment and dismissal are entirely decided by Director Li. There is absolutely no connection to the so-called sovereignty issue. Regarding the explanation of the sovereignty issue, the bureau has previously disclosed it in detail in the newspapers. The security personnel who were dismissed this time, in order to protect their personal interests and try to restore their evil forces, are resorting to the trick of releasing smoke, using the words "sovereignty" to embellish their words and sensationalize the situation. In fact, the issue of power can only be researched by those with considerable expertise in law, he said.</p>
<h3>Trial of Meat Industry Standing Committee Member Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Awaiting Subpoena for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Huang Yexin, a standing committee member of the Fresh Meat Industry Association, was accused by Zhou Chengxiang, Zhou Yueliang, Jin Guifu, Yao Desheng, and others, who run meat shops in Xujiahui, of embezzling public funds from the slaughter tax. After the prosecutor of the local court filed a public prosecution, Judge Wang Shanxiang held a trial yesterday. Huang Yexin appeared in court with his lawyer, Zhang Shiben. According to his defense: (1) Procedurally, the complainants are not members of the Meat Industry Association, nor are they real meat merchants, and have no direct interest. However, they claim to be representatives of meat merchants from the surrounding countryside, without any power of attorney to prove it, and are not recognized by the industry in the surrounding countryside, which is a deceptive tactic. Therefore, they have no right to sue. (2) The organization of the Shanghai Municipal Slaughter Improvement Funding Committee was established by the municipal authorities, under the guidance and supervision of the Municipal Society, Finance, and Health Bureaus, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which each sent one representative, and the Meat Industry Association, which sent three representatives, to manage the improvement and reorganization of various public welfare undertakings in the meat industry with the funds from the slaughter tax. Three people were mutually elected as standing committee members, and one person was elected as chairman. The rules were established and reported to the municipal government for record and announced for implementation. The association was organized and established in August of the 20th year of the Republic. The defendant took office in June of the 21st year of the Republic, after the resignation of Committee Member Yan Weixiao, who represented the meat industry. For more than a year in office, he organized large and small undertakings that were approved by the committee and reported to the municipal government for approval before applying to the Finance Bureau for funding. Every six months, he prepared a report on the income and expenditure of the administrative expenses, together with the calculation books and vouchers, and reported them to the municipal government for verification and cancellation, and notified the relevant agencies and groups. In October of the 22nd year of the Republic, after receiving an order to close down, he submitted a final statement of income and expenditure and handed it over to the municipal government for acceptance. At that time, the Meat Industry Association suspected that there were no piles and repeatedly requested the municipal government to order the association to announce the detailed rules. However, the association directly paid the monthly regular expenses, while other expenses, such as the expenses of various schools, were received by the principals in whole, and the expenses of charitable hygiene, etc., were either received by the Industry Association or received by the designated person in charge, all of which were issued in whole and receipts were obtained. They were repeatedly submitted to the municipal government for verification and cancellation, and the municipal government appointed clerk Sun Baozhang, Meat Industry Association Chairman Rong Qianchu, and members of various bureaus to the scene to examine the income and expenditure one by one, all of which were signed and certified as consistent, and then reported to the municipal government for record. Therefore, the system of the association is one of the subordinate organs of the municipal government, rather than a merchant group. The funds of the association are purely public funds, not merchant funds of the plaintiff, and they have no right to sue. As for the alleged embezzlement, the substantive matter has been found to be correct by the previous meeting, and there is no crime to speak of. After questioning and verifying his defense, the court ordered a subpoena to be issued for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Chicks</h3>
<p>— Lin Jia</p>
<p>If I were in my hometown, at this time I would have raised a few yellow and black chicks.</p>
<p>The wheat in the fields floats gold and glittering in the sunlight, and spring has gone far away. The cuckoo sings so diligently, "Cut the wheat and plant the rice." In the melon garden, the melon trellis has been built, and the weather is getting warmer and warmer. The farmers, wearing reed hats, stay by the fields, tapping the hard mud with small cedar sticks for beating thieves, singing one line after another, "In the fifth month, it is the Dragon Boat Festival, the death of a virtuous wife is so desolate, realgar wine, too lazy to taste, ..."</p>
<p>Along with this simple song, a long call comes from the streets of the countryside: "Who buys little goslings, exchange them if they are sick..."</p>
<p>These peddlers are beloved by the children. They are all tall and big, wearing climbing cloth shoes on their feet, and dark-colored coarse cloth pants tied with a five-inch wide board belt. On their dark and tight backs, they slant a small cloth shirt, and a straw hat as big as a wheel covers the top of their heads. On their shoulders is a thin wooden carrying pole with two ends raised, and under each end are eight strands of hemp rope, tied to a bamboo basket that is large enough for four six-year-old children to sleep in without crowding. He treads softly on the smoky dust, passing through the fences of the farmhouses. When a white-haired, disheveled old woman or a few mud-like, naked children walk out of the gate, he repeats this attractive tone, and then chooses a large tree shade or a mill shed to put down the load, open the thin burlap cover of the bamboo basket, and a burst of trivial and clear chirping sounds, like a plate of hungry silkworms eating freshly picked mulberry leaves, chirping non-stop.</p>
<p>In the basket, there are hundreds of pairs of apricot-yellow, velvety chicks and ten pairs of mouse-like, black, shiny chicks. Each one is full of vitality and actively jumps around, raising their little heads with pointed beaks, and turning their pairs of surprised round eyes, chirping in surprise at this strange big world.</p>
<p>Grandma and the children all have their dreams. She uses the money she earns from spinning four taels of cotton thread a night, and the children use the New Year's money they earn from kowtowing during the holidays, both equally conservative in their inherited farmer's character, choosing, arguing, calculating the amount of money, and sighing:</p>
<p>"So expensive, I won't buy it."</p>
<p>The chicken peddler answers in the tone he is used to dealing with these people:</p>
<p>"Old lady, look carefully, a chicken, guaranteed to weigh five taels. I bet you, this yellow and white one is a pullet. When it grows up, it will lay eggs without fail. Four eggs will be enough for the capital!"</p>
<p>"Don't say that, what about the grain?"</p>
<p>"What about raising pigs?"</p>
<p>"Raising pigs is for manure."</p>
<p>"Pigs need to be fed, chickens will find food themselves."</p>
<p>As a result, the grandmother and grandson count the copper coins in their palms and give them to the peddler, and carry them home in a small round basket. The children are no longer willing to leave the chicks that eat husked rice. At night, to prevent greedy cats, they hang a pair of small straw baskets on the beams, but often their efforts are in vain, and a clever cat actually eats the poor chicks cleanly in the deep of night without making a sound.</p>
<p>It has been fifteen years since I left that life that is regarded as a groundhog by the nobles. My younger siblings may still be playing with those chicks at this time, and it may be said that they no longer have any money to buy those lovely little things because the family is getting poorer and poorer. I miss home, and I also want to live that peaceful and simple life like in my childhood.</p>
<h3>Three Kinds of Understanding</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Mr. Song Zheyuan said to people: Chinese people must have a global understanding, Chinese people must have an understanding of Japan, and Chinese people must have an understanding of China. If everyone can do this, then we can talk about saving the country. This is very true! For the Chinese of today, this kind of understanding is absolutely necessary! Otherwise, nothing can be discussed, and the country cannot be saved. But what kind of understanding should we have of the world, of Japan, and of our country?</p>
<p>Regarding the world, we must understand: the current international relations are extremely complex. Within them, there is opposition between the aggressive front and the peaceful front, conflicts between right-leaning and left-leaning ideologies, the struggle between imperialism and oppressed nations, and even infighting among imperialist powers. These crises are very likely to erupt. Today's world is moving in the direction of war. To gain a foothold in this chaotic situation, one must struggle with one's own strength. Relying on others will not work. Letting the strong arrange things is even worse. This is a path to self-destruction!</p>
<p>Regarding Japan, we must see clearly: Japan is a militaristic country with ambitions for external expansion. And China is its biggest target for invasion! The land of the Northeast has already been seized by them through force. Now the other side is devoting all its efforts to plotting against North China. Japan's invasion of our country ultimately aims to realize its continental policy. If we understand this, we must first make a firm resolution to deal with it! Otherwise, one day China may become a vassal of Japan!</p>
<p>Regarding our own country, we must recognize: the current state of China is facing increasingly serious national crises. The entire country, under the covetous gaze of a powerful enemy, is constantly in danger of destruction! Therefore, if we want to save the country, the only way out is to launch a national struggle, to seek survival from death. This task is naturally extremely difficult. But we must not be discouraged or lose heart. As long as everyone is aware and rises up together,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>it is not difficult to reverse our fate and restore our nation!</p>
<p>The above points are my personal observations, and may differ from others, but generally, they should not be far from the truth. In short, only by understanding the general trend of the world can we determine how to conduct ourselves amidst the changes of the situation. Only by seeing clearly the attitude of Japan can we adopt methods of resistance under heavy pressure! Only by understanding our own situation can we muster all our strength and fight for the country! This is what military strategists call "knowing the enemy and knowing yourself," and it is something that those who talk about saving the country today cannot fail to pay close attention to!</p>
<h3>Scrambling for Leftovers</h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>This semi-nomadic life, even the time and place for eating are uncertain. I've run through restaurants that boast "economy," and tasted all sorts of different flavors. Sichuan restaurants lean towards spicy, Northern restaurants are sometimes spicy with a hint of bitterness, and Cantonese restaurants have rice that's hard and difficult to swallow. This kind of food doesn't really suit my appetite. To fill my stomach, I can only force it down. Only the food from my hometown suits my taste, a bit of sweetness hidden in the saltiness. But my increasingly barren hometown can no longer accommodate me. The great winds of life blew me out, to this supposedly prosperous city, using all my strength, widening my moist eyes, to scramble for the leftovers of others. These leftovers, however, are seen by others as the source of their entire lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps the enjoyment of human life can never be balanced. In the city, the two sides of this unbalanced life are displayed even more clearly. In Western-style buildings, some people have food—already tired of eating delicacies from land and sea. On the steps below the Western-style buildings, there are people sitting, greedily swallowing coarse grains. When I see those thin, dirty "little beggars" blocking the path of the food carriers, scrambling for the leftover scraps of food in the baskets, I feel that I am relatively happier. Although my life is also obtained through scrambling, I don't have to be scolded, beaten, or kicked... subjected to all sorts of inhumane and unbearable insults. But these kinds of tragedies are being performed everywhere:</p>
<p>It was in a restaurant that wasn't very big. I became a patron in the evening. Because there were many diners, ordering food took some time to wait. Sitting near the door was a single diner. He had already finished eating comfortably. He wiped his face, picked his teeth, drank tea, and read the evening newspaper. His face was flushed, knowing he had drunk some wine. He looked very comfortable. On his table, there was still more than half a bowl of rice, half a piece of "four happiness meatballs," and some chicken bones left over. For someone like me, these leftovers would be enough to fill my stomach. But to maintain a kind of self-respect, I would never beg him to give them to me.</p>
<p>But there were people begging for handouts. Right in front of him, next to the glass door, a person as thin as a skeleton, as dirty as a ghost. He said intermittently: "Sir, please give me the things on the table, sir... like... like you'd feed a dog at home..." His voice was lowered, as if afraid others would hear. His sunken eyes stared at the half bowl of rice, half piece of meat, and those scattered chicken bones on the table. The diner didn't pay any attention, still reading the newspaper, picking his teeth, and drinking tea, looking very comfortable. I really wanted to go up and tell him, or do this favor for him, but I didn't. I was still suppressed by a kind of self-respect: Why meddle?</p>
<p>The waiter hadn't brought my food yet, so I simply watched this drama unfold:</p>
<p>Another ragged person appeared next to the glass door, younger than the first one. Although both were under the pressure of hunger, they seemed to be in a state of antagonism. The first one's right foot had already crossed the threshold, his hands reaching out, but not daring to reach out rashly. He was still speaking in a low voice, begging for the leftover food, his eyes stealing glances at the waiter, probably fearing the waiter's interference and expulsion. I could see clearly that his arms were shaking, his legs were also shaking. The one behind only showed a dark face over the first one's shoulder, as if also eagerly waiting for an opportunity to come, his eyes also firmly fixed on the leftovers on the table.</p>
<p>The diner folded up the evening newspaper, stood up, and prepared to leave. Only then did he hear the pleading words that had been spoken for quite a while. He twisted his mouth indifferently, with a hint of drunkenness. The person by the glass door rushed in, and before he could grab the leftover food, the younger one followed closely, turning into four hands scrambling for the leftover scraps on the table. "I asked this gentleman first, you're snatching it!" "Let's each take a little, fill our bellies." The two sons started arguing in front of the guest. The guest was annoyed: "None for either of you, go, go, go..." The waiter brought my food, hurriedly went over to chase the two people out, cleared away the dishes and bowls, poured the broth and water into one container, glanced at the door, "Beggars, bring money if you want to eat!" he said sarcastically, and carried the dishes away. I picked up my rice bowl, looking at the two distressed faces outside the glass door. I felt that my own life, though also a scramble for leftovers, was still relatively happier after all. When will human life ever achieve balance? I pondered like this...</p>
<h3>Ghost Market</h3>
<p>— Jiang Niao</p>
<p>Before the irritating sound of frogs breaks the silence of the air, in that desolate, dim corner, could it perhaps be a ghost market at this time?</p>
<p>No trace of travelers can be found, only a few distant barks of dogs are heard from time to time: then everything returns to silence, silence.</p>
<p>It is dusk, wisps of smoke are coming out of the chimneys of distant villages, gradually blurring, disappearing.</p>
<p>The streetlights are flickering with dim light.</p>
<p>Heaps of people who have lost their spiritual core—perhaps a machine of flesh, lascivious and charming bas-reliefs cover the wounds of the heart and body, gathering there like ghostly figures.</p>
<p>They all drag their tired bodies, their mouths exhaling the pungent smell of alcohol, their eyelids drooping heavily, unbuttoning their clothes, revealing their red, greasy chests, dripping with sweat, mumbling crude, dull, and unpleasant tunes, each coming here to seek their comfort.</p>
<p>They often quarrel and curse their companions for their own momentary happiness...</p>
<p>Waves of disturbing noises are surging around.</p>
<p>The moon casts down its pure white veil, hanging askew in the east.</p>
<p>The "ghost market" is brewing gray dreams again!</p>
<h3>Introducing Generalissimo Chiang's Half-Month in Xi'an</h3>
<p>Introducing Generalissimo Chiang's Half-Month in Xi'an</p>
<p>The Northwest is the birthplace of our Chinese nation, and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident before was truly a chance for the rebirth of our Chinese nation. Even today, with the passage of time, every time we recall the situation of the Xi'an Incident, we cannot help but feel disturbed and pray silently for the safety of our national leader.</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident, as Madam Chiang put it, was truly the last righteous revolutionary struggle for the fate of our country. When the incident was tense, the entire country was of one mind, showing it in their expressions. With an unprecedented spirit of unity and a unified voice, they ran around and appealed for the sole national leader, deeply knowing that if the Xi'an Incident was resolved one day and the leader was safely rescued from danger one day, then our nation, which had fallen into the depths of water and fire, could regain a glimmer of hope for revival. Although this move by the people of the country stemmed from the urgent and compelling love for the leader in the face of hardship, distress, and imminent peril, it also sufficiently proved the people of the country's profound understanding of the leader's selfless devotion to the country. It showed that our leader could lift the Chinese nation from countless calamities, and that the unity and solidarity of the compatriots throughout the country could accomplish the arduous plan of saving the country and seeking survival. This kind of understanding by the people of the country was nothing less than restoring the spiritual foundation of the nation, and this spiritual foundation was fully expressed during the Xi'an Incident. The Xi'an Incident was not only a touchstone for the national concept of the people of the country, but also a general expression of the Chinese nation's desire for revival.</p>
<p>Previously, when we read the full text of Generalissimo Chiang's instructions to Zhang and Yang before leaving Xi'an, the great righteousness and passionate spirit filled us with emotion and tears. Only with the most sincere heart for the country can one utter such sincere and touching words. It is not only enough to serve as a principle for our lives, but its great spirit can also serve as the highest lesson in history forever. Recently, the Zhengzhong Book Company compiled and published Generalissimo Chiang's half-month diary in Xi'an and Madam Chiang Song Meiling's memoir of the Xi'an Incident, so that we can see more deeply the leader's great personality in this historical event that has had a significant impact on the history of national revival, and the greatest and most upright national character expressed in the leader's behavior, which is indispensable for every national fighter who is struggling to build internally and resist externally for a long time in this dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Generalissimo Chiang is involved in countless affairs and bears the weight of the country's safety, causing the news of the Xi'an Incident to spread throughout the country and shock the world. This can be seen clearly in Madam Chiang's memoirs, in which she describes the various situations at the time. With the occurrence of the incident, the whole country was in despair, and Madam Chiang's sense of public and private justice warred in her heart. She was able to restrain her emotions and put the country and the people first in everything. On days of rain and snow, braving difficult journeys with ice on the road, she carried the last hope of the people of the whole country and entered the tiger's den in person. In an extremely harsh atmosphere, she maneuvered and finally overcame the strong with justice, protecting the leader from danger and restoring the country to peace. Her memoir is beautifully written and is already a valuable historical literary material. In particular, looking at history, there are few women of valor who have established virtue and accomplished meritorious deeds like Madam Chiang's actions this time, which have filled the people of the whole country with gratitude. I would like to quote a few words to introduce this historically valuable document. It must be known that reading this book not only allows us to learn about the various truths of the Xi'an Incident, but also that the leader's words and deeds can serve as a permanent model for us.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezhi</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>During the peace talks, Li Hongzhang agreed to all the conditions proposed by the Allied Forces that would result in the loss of national sovereignty, but the conditions that insulted the imperial family were really difficult for him. After the meeting, Li Hongzhang gathered officials from various departments to discuss strategies to deal with the situation. Knowing that Sai Jinhua had close relations with the commander of the Allied Forces, he wanted to put this "major responsibility" on a weak woman to intercede with Waldersee.</p>

<h3>How to Back Up</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Backing a car into a defined and narrow space in a parking lot is the final and most difficult lesson in learning to drive. Many people can change gears or restart on a hillside, but when asked to back into a parking space, they freeze. The reason for this is clear: because it is the most difficult part of driving, the instructor often drives it for the beginner to see, rather than directly teaching the beginner to practice. This is a mistake, because only through gradual practice can the beginner make progress.</p>
<p>When backing a car into a parking space, the driver must be able to do two things. First, he must be able to steer correctly with one hand, while keeping the other hand ready to use the brake to stop or change gears. Second, he must be able to use the clutch and accelerator well so that he can move forward and backward at the slowest speed. If you are not confident in the speed of the car, backing up will not be a smooth process. Because in certain situations, even a speed of four miles per hour is still too fast. Moreover, a lack of confidence in speed will lead to fear, and fear will eliminate confidence.</p>
<p>The visibility behind the car is poor, so the speed must be extremely slow when backing up. Therefore, beginners should practice in a convertible before they have gained complete confidence. Because without obstructions, the visibility in all directions is unimpeded, and the difficulty of backing up can be greatly reduced. When practicing, it should be done in an open space and alone. Because a nervous driver is afraid of the person standing next to him. Initially, practice driving straight back. Of course, you should make sure in advance that there are no obstacles or dangers behind the car. Then drive straight along the sidewalk. This method is not suitable for ordinary roads, because the traffic there cannot be predicted in advance. When driving, put your arm on the car door and your left hand on the steering wheel to steer. Then stick your head out of the car window so you can see clearly what is going on along the outside of the car. This method is very useful in narrow places, otherwise it will be difficult to back into a defined position. There is also another method, which is to use the rearview mirror. However, this can only be used in spacious places. Before attempting difficult parking techniques, you must first have preliminary practice, until you can move forward and backward at will in a space that is only a few inches wider than the car—whether its direction is straight or angled. When practicing, you can use two bamboo poles instead of practicing in a real doorway. When practicing, gradually shorten the distance between the two bamboo poles. If you steer the car wrong, you will not damage the car body. And the learner can easily find that the front wheels do not always follow the rear wheels. When backing up, sometimes the rear has safely passed the gatepost, but the front is damaged. Therefore, although the rear of the car has safely passed the gatepost, we must pay close attention to the front. In short, parking in a parking lot is the most difficult thing in driving. Backing up, changing gears, and sudden stops are all necessary and important skills.</p>
<p>To park the car between two cars that are already parked on the side of the road, the best way is to first drive the car past the gap, and then back the car in. Stop the rear wheels where the car is expected to stop after it is parked properly. Then use the steering wheel to turn the front wheels in. In this kind of situation, simply using the method of driving forward will not work.</p>
<h3>The American Automobile Industry in Late Spring</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>March Production Breaks Records</p>
<p>Not long ago, the automobile production center of the United States, Detroit, was experiencing a strike. At that time, some people were worried that it would affect automobile production. Fortunately, the strike did not last very long. After several negotiations between labor and management, the storm gradually subsided. Although each factory was somewhat affected during the strike, the authorities worked hard afterwards to make up for the lost time. Therefore, the result was not only not bad, but the automobile production in March 1937 created a new record in the history of automobile manufacturing, becoming the best month since June 1929.</p>
<p>Several giants in the American automobile industry, such as General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, all had good results during this period. General Motors had several shutdowns and restarts during the strike, but once the storm was resolved, they ran at full capacity, striving to produce as much as possible. The production volume of two of their divisions became the highest point in their history, and the high production volume was truly amazing. Ford and Chrysler were not far behind, with production volumes reaching almost the maximum limit, with the number of vehicles manufactured each day at around 7,000. When the strike was tense and their factories were temporarily shut down, the output of Chrysler and Hudson factories was also at its peak.</p>
<p>The brisk sales of high-priced cars can indicate the prosperity of the market. Among the products of various automobile factories, those cars with a selling price of US$1,000 or more have good business. The Ford factory's high-priced car, the "Lincoln Zephyr," has sold almost three times as many as it did a year ago. The number of retail deliveries in the current popular model year has reached more than 10,000. Therefore, the output of the Lincoln Zephyr by the end of March will increase significantly compared to 1936. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Record of the New York Trailer Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Nie</p>
<p>Recently, automobile dealers from southern New York and Connecticut held a trailer exhibition in "Plainview," at the West Gishes County Center. This was the first of its kind in the New York area. All the products of the more famous automobile trailer manufacturing companies participated in the event. Several trailer manufacturers also displayed automobiles to show the coordination between their products and automobiles. These manufacturers were Cord, Duesenberg, Ford, Lincoln, Nash, Lafayette, Packard, Chrysler, and Plymouth.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of the various trailers displayed at the venue was the tight internal configuration. Everything that is indispensable in a modern household is fully equipped in the trailer. However, although there are many things, they still maintain their spacious and comfortable characteristics due to proper equipment.</p>
<p>The wardrobes and cooking utensils that ladies pay the most attention to are fully equipped in various trailers. Other items such as dining tables, lounge chairs, bookcases, dish racks, showers, and even bathtubs are all available. Most of the various devices in the car can be re-equipped according to the customer's wishes, as long as they have discussed it with the dealer in advance.</p>
<p>When planning this "mobile home," the manufacturers paid the most attention to refrigerators, water supply, hot water heaters, ventilation equipment, etc., because these things are indispensable in modern homes.</p>
<p>Among all the trailers on display, two were the most noticed by the audience. One was specially built by the Western Union Telegraph Company, with its interior designed as a relay station. In the event of an emergency, such as the recent flood in the Wahaihua area, it could be used as a telegraph relay station to prevent the interruption of telecommunications. The second was a trailer customized by Pastor Sullivan, which was to be used specifically for preaching in China in the future. The pastors who visited the venue were very interested in the equipment of this trailer, and many wanted to imitate it so that it could be used as a special vehicle for spreading the gospel in the countryside.</p>
<p>There was also a section in the venue dedicated to displaying "parts." Among them was a product of the New York Automatic Battery Charging Company. This machine can pump the water stored in the tank into the battery. The water in this tank can be used for 10,000 miles without refilling. Attached to this machine is a measuring table that shows the water level and the actual situation of the battery bottle. It is said that this charging device is very useful for trailer users.</p>
<p>The trailer exhibition lasted for a total of six days. During the exhibition, the number of visitors was very enthusiastic, estimated to be around 20,000. The manager of the venue was Mr. Nathol. According to him, it will be held again at the same location this fall, but the scale may be smaller.</p>
<p>The New York Trailer Exhibition had never been held before, so this was indeed the first time. In total, there were fourteen manufacturers or dealers participating in the exhibition, with a total of thirty-eight trailers. A total of forty-five trailers were sold on the spot in the venue, but many people, although they did not decide to buy, were very willing to buy one in their minds. All these accounts have been recorded by the dealers, who are preparing to ask salespersons to promote them. Therefore, everyone is very satisfied with the results of this exhibition.</p>
<h3>General Motors Opens Diesel Engine Factory</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Sloan, the General Manager of General Motors, announced that the new factory to be opened by the company will be named the Diesel Engine Factory, specializing in the manufacture of Winton diesel engines. However, in the beginning, it will specialize in the manufacture of 20-horsepower single-cylinder engines for use in stationary machinery. Subsequently, it will increase to 160-horsepower six-cylinder engines to suit various uses for waterborne and stationary machinery and commercial vehicles. As for the manufacture of diesel engine fuel injectors, the General Motors Experimental Field has been working hard on it for seven years. It will now be transferred to the new factory as soon as possible to facilitate its progress. The company has now purchased a site of 75 acres at the intersection of the PereMntquotte Railway and OuterDrive•Detroit for the new factory. All construction work will begin soon. However, the first to be built will be the mechanical engineering laboratory. All diesel engine testing work related to the new factory will be carried out in this laboratory. In addition, a diesel-electric power plant will be attached to the laboratory to supply power to the manufacturing factory. All heating needs will be supplied by electric boilers. The general manager of the new factory is Mr•W•T•Crowe. The remaining staff will be announced one after another soon.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Savings on the New Willys</h3>
<p>The 1937 New Willys automobile, in addition to employing a fully welded, all-steel body and roof, and specially sized brakes with increased braking surface, as well as a synchronized transmission, also boasts countless other features such as fully equipped safety glass and a lowered vehicle center of gravity. Among these, the most noteworthy is its unparalleled economic efficiency. According to owner reports, the new car achieves over 40 miles per gallon, effectively cutting gasoline expenses in half. As for engine oil, each oil change requires only four quarts. Furthermore, each set of tires can last over 40,000 miles. Depreciation rate, vehicle tax, and insurance fees are all extremely low. The cost of the New Willys is so economical, yet its novel beauty and performance are no different from that of luxury automobiles. This is why it is especially welcomed by the general public.</p>
