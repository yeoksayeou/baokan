<h3>我空軍首次出戰炸燬三敌舰建立殊勳</h3>
<p>筧橋擊落敵重轟炸機三架　日軍根據地被炸損失奇重　我駕駛員任雲閣以身殉國</p>
<p>昨晨十時起、我空軍奉令正式應戰、一方面轟炸敵軍事根據地、及浦江中各敵艦、同時掩護我前綫部隊衝鋒進攻、在我陸空軍猛烈掃蕩下、敵受創奇重、敵機倉皇逃匿、杭州筧橋方面敵重轟炸機亦前往投彈、被我擊落二架、閘北等處敵機三五飛來、亦均經先後擊退、無所施其“一二八”時閘北一片焦士之故技、我空軍首次殺敵、浦江中炸燬敵艦一艘、炸傷一艘、楊林口復炸沉其一、彈落敵旗艦“出雲”左右者數枚、與敵以莫大威脅、我空軍作戰技術巧妙純熟、昨日下午四時、我機圍炸出雲旗艦時、敵機四出應戰、激戰一小時餘、我機卒能以寡敵衆、全師奏凱而還、千萬民衆在彈雨下竚立街頭歡呼、誠為遠東最光榮空戰史之一頁、亦可謂遠東空前未有之空戰、茲詳紀其經過如下、</p>
<p>本報十四日常熟急電、刻得確息、晨九時二十分、白茆口與楊林口間江面泊一日艦、為我輕轟炸機擲彈中的、艦身大部炸毀、日艦曾發高砲還擊、城區聞砲聲頗淸晰、又已刻此間聞重砲聲十餘響、歷五分鐘始息、似係由楊林瀏河口方面傳來、但地方甚安、</p>
<p>據確息、昨日下午二時許、有敵軍重量轟炸機兩架、飛至杭州及筧橋上空、施行轟炸、我方辜前得報、早有預備、故當敵機來襲時、卽被我空軍包圍射擊、結果兩敵機均被我擊落、我方戰鬥機有一架亦受傷、</p>
<p>中央社杭州十四日電、十四日下午五時、日軍之雙發動機重轟炸機十一架、由台灣方面飛到杭州、向航空學校投彈、我空軍口隊事前得報、當卽還擊、敵機三架被擊落、一落在車山（地名）一落在蕭山、一落在錢塘江附近、駕駛員二人逃出、被我捕獲、我航空學校因事前已有準備、一切均已遷移、故無損傷、其餘敵機八架、旋又飛至我廣德機塲轟炸、僅傷我方士兵二人、停在該處之飛機一架、尾部受微傷、但該八架敵機被我空軍還擊、其中五架受傷甚重、狼狽逃去、先後墜於浙境、現正搜查中、又據報吿、殘餘之敵機三架、於晚八時許、經溫州飛回台灣、嗣據績報、受傷逃逸之敵機五架因汽油吿罄、在蘭溪附近降落云、</p>
<p>中央社十四日南京電云、航空界息、日方於十四日下午三時許、由臺灣派重轟炸機十一架、飛至杭州投彈、當經我防空部隊擊落二架、餘九架逃去、聞杭州被炸地帶所受損失極微、又訊、日機由抗逃去後、又飛安微廣德投彈損失未詳、</p>
<p>中央社云、本市某軍事機關、昨接何部長電吿、昨日下午二時許、有日本轟炸二架、先赴抗州實行空襲、經我空軍奮勇激戰、將其完全擊燬、惟我機亦略受傷云、</p>
<p>黃浦上室激烈空戰</p>
<p>昨日下午三時五十分、我空軍飛機三架、又在上空出動、仍以出雲旗艦為轟炸目標、先向該艦四週略作偵察、旋卽分東西北三路前進、向敵艦猛投炸彈、敵艦上登時大亂、又亂開機關高射砲及機關槍、向上空射擊、但我機行動殊為靈敏、飛行高度距離、適以敵艦射程將到達限度為止、同時敵水上機六架、亦緊急出動應戰、我機卽奮勇與之接觸、而黃浦江上空之遠東空前空戰、卽呈現於萬千市民目前、我機技術純熟、以最迅速之動作、忽而高翔、穿入雲表、忽而低飛、掠頂而過、所採戰略、或為總攻式、或為包抄式、或由前後夾擊、或從兩冀進攻、均使敵機倉皇失措、前後不能兼顧、我軍共進玫敵艦凡十餘次、敵艦前後發砲千餘響、敵艦遭我重大威脅、受創奇重、狼狽不堪、我機始終未被擊中、此次空戰殊為劇烈、砲如連珠、聲如巨雷、黑點層密、烟霧漫天、麈戰至一小時又二十分鐘之久、我軍始於五時十分許告捷、揚長飛去、當激戰時、千萬民衆暨西僑等、均麈集外灘一帶及附近觀戰、毫無懼色、並以我空軍首次出動、卽予敵人以重創、實開我國軍事歷史上未有之光榮紀錄、故無不欣然高呼、以壯聲勢、望平街上是時適為晚報發行時間、故市民特別擁擠、咸駐足仰觀、當時機聲軋軋、雜以機關槍及高射砲之隆隆聲、空中流彈亂飛、舞落街心、市民受傷始紛紛奔避、秩序來免紊亂、但愉快之色、充分在面部表現、人叢中一片中國空軍萬歲聲、足證民衆愛國之血誠、至七時許、我機一架又飛來偵察、敵艦不待我機飛近、卽又開砲亂射、其頑强圖抗、舉措倉皇之情狀、顯然可見、</p>
<p>日艦兩艘中彈爆炸</p>
<p>昨日下午四時四十分許、楊樹浦方面我另一隊空軍戰士、曾駕戰機口架、前往該處一帶偵察、當是停泊在該處浦面上之日艦三艘、卽以五六架高射砲、在同一高度及同一角度內同時開砲、向我機攻擊、砲彈當空爆炸、宛如梅花初放、但斯時我忠勇之飛將軍、鎮靜沉着、在敵彈爆炸時、卽中止前進、立刻降低、在已炸之砲彈下安全越過、重復升高飛回原處、瞬息間卽一齊下降低飛、於迫近日艦時、各機炸彈齊落、擊中兩艦、方始折回、常時中彈日艦、立卽起火、後悉一艦已毀、一艦受傷、惟炸彈爆作時之聲浪、其響如雷、浦江水花飛濺及於兩岸、專後吳淞口外、曾飛起日機二架、企圖追擊我機、但斯時我機早巳完畢任務、歸回本隊矣、</p>
<p>投彈轟炸日司令部</p>
<p>我國空軍於昨晨十時許、奉令出動、參加空戰、當以𣓾樹涌　底軍工路旁　之日商公大紗廠、為日軍東區根據地、日軍司令部亦附設於內、故我軍爲控制戰事起見、除陸軍方面、於昨晨拂曉、由江灣方面向東推進、猛攻敵軍外、我空軍習機□架、同時亦飛往楊樹浦方面、以日軍司令部為目標、投弱轟炸、並以機槍掃射、敵軍驟遭我空陸夾擊、損失奇重、昨日下午、經我空軍向敵艦及其後防轟炸後、迨七時許、已將日軍駐集之日商公犬第一、上海第二、第三、東華、裕豐等紗廠、完全炸毀、同興紗廠則被中二彈、已毀壞不堪、英文大美晚報云、華軍飛機今日（十四日）先後侵擊爾次、第二次曾有炸彈兩枚擊中公和祥碼頭公司、傷華人七名、外人一名、為會計員海德、據該公司監𣈉格蘭特聲稱、襲擊者共飛機□架、該公司房屋已全炸毀、</p>
<p>我機圍攻出雲旗艦</p>
<p>上午十時三十分許、我空軍兩小隊計轟炸機六架、奉命在浦面一帶偵察、當時停泊在浦江中心之日旗艦“出雲”號、卽以高射砲向我機射擊、惟我空軍翱翔甚高、日艦雖施威脅、我軍卽向該艦投彈三枚、惟以風勢甚大、彈被風力吹動、致發標的稍偏、未曾命中、一彈落於江中、浪花濺起、并翻舳舨船三艘、兩彈落於“出雲”左近浦面、將該艦激起數尺、浮蕩水面、惟以炸時聲力過大、致浦西外灘各屋玻璃窗都被震毀、而在公共汽車及電車上乘客等、因臨時不明究竟、大起驚慌、紛自車上躍出、向就近倘未關閉之各商行內躲避、當我機向該艦齋投炸彈時、該艦上全部日軍出動，日砲手卽架準高射砲、及機關槍、向吾軍飛機射擊、但我機駕駛行動極為敏捷、當放下炸彈後、卽疾閃入雲霄、離敵艦以槍砲向吾猛射、但皆未命傷、吾機投彈三四次、盤旋約二十分鐘卽飛去、旋於午後一時二十分許、我機二架、又在浦江上空出現、並連續向敵艦猛投炸彈、敵艦倉皇萬狀、乃命亂開高射砲、密如連珠、共發一百餘響，但我機於飛退時僅有微損傷、而流彈波及外白渡橋及外灘公園一帶、傷及行人頗多、</p>
<p>流彈擊傷行人數百</p>
<p>當中日空軍凌空麈戰之際、日水上飛機竟在上空用機關槍向下掃射、致各處流彈亂飛、因此在外白大橋、及黃浦灘路·南京路口·靜安寺路·新世界附近、均有被流彈擊傷者、先後總計不下三百餘人、而因人多擁擠奔避踐傷者、亦不下百餘人、內中以婦女孩童為最多、當時卽經租界當局通飭各救火車馳出救護、並陸續送往仁濟等醫院救治、惟以人數過多、致施術方面曾威困難、所有受傷者姓氏　以篇輻關係、不及備錄、此外間有走失者、惟難民救濟所正在四出查訪、故一般走失男女家屬、均往該所訊問云、</p>
<p>浦東春江碼頭附近、於昨日下午因有流彈落下、忽然起火、當時先見白烟瀰漫、旋漸散去、但不久續起火熖、乃姑燃燒火焰騰空、滿天皆紅、入晚愈燒愈烈、起係撲救困難之故、並悉該處係為亞細亞火油池云、</p>
<p>京滬杭南北火車站新建之管理局局所、據聞於昨晨六時許、曾被流彈所擊、惟地位甚小、且非緊要、故一無損失、　　五日艦襲瀏河失敗</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日下午有日艦五艘、駛至瀏河、企圖掩護軍隊登陸襲擊、我空軍得報卽飛往轟炸、當卽炸沉日艦一艘、其餘四艘亦受有相當損傷云、</p>
<p>俞市長覆英美抗議</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日空戰、英美兩國領事以飛機炸彈紛落於各該闕軍艦附近、特向俞市長提出抗議、俞市長當卽答稱、我國空軍隨時有轟炸日艦之可能、各國軍艦理應遠離日艦、以避免危險、否則我方不能負責也云云、</p>

<p>日艦灰色他國鋪旗</p>
<p>泊滬之日軍艦、截至昨日為止、共有廿六艘、昨日下午五時三刻、復有日本魚電艦一艘進口、因其徽業已塗去，故其名稱及號數、皆不得而知云、而停泊法租界金得源外灘浦面、距離我封鎖南黃浦面約百碼左右之日砲艦八六號一艘、原係淡湖色艦身、於昨日下午三時起、因受我空軍之注目、彼卽改塗灰色、以避目標、又駐拍浦面之英美注各國軍艦、因我空軍出動、日機迎擊、故為使方易識辨別計、特將各該國旗橫鋪艦面、以示區別、藉避誤會、</p>

<p>［巴黎］法國各報𩔖皆評論上海戰事、埃克西有報載稱、中日兩國軍隊、此次在上海衝突之後、全世界人士咸皆注意、英法美三國政府當此遠東時局演進之際、自當設法保持其旣得權曁在遠東政治經濟上所處之地位、時代報載稱、“關於在上海方面發動大規模戰事一層、東京政府似尚猶豫不决、而有與中國進行談判之意、但砲聲發出之後、卽欲懸崖勒馬、則憂手其難矣”云、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>正吿僑滬外人</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>從日本藉口虹橋事件。向我方提出無理要求。並於前天向我閘北防軍進攻以來。我軍爲保護領土主權完整起見亦卽發動自衛權。予打擊者以打擊。幸賴我軍的奮勇抗戰與空軍的出動。經過一日夜的劇戰。已將華界的敵人完全掃除。乃日軍於敗退之後。竟襲一二八時的故智將公共租界作爲進攻我軍的軍事根據地。於是我方被逼。亦只有採取自衛行動。予以反擊。關於這點。俞市長曾於昨晨致函領事團有所說明函內略謂“本市長有應促起各友邦駐滬當局嚴切注意者。卽本國軍事當局希望及要求各國有關方面。對於日軍利用租界爲軍事根據地。以攻擊我國軍隊一節。應卽迅速制止。否則我軍萬一被逼。採取自衛行動。以减少日軍利用租界爲軍事根據地之危害時。所有因此發生之一切結果。我國不能負責。”</p>
<p>俞市長的聲明眞是義正辭嚴的表白租界本是我國的領土。它的產生。原不過爲便利外國僑民居住起見根本不能用作進攻我國的軍事根據地。乃日本帝國主義者爲着便利其侵略我國起見。從一二八時起。卽利用公共租界蘇州河以北地帶爲進攻華界的根據地。英美方面因爲迫於日本的威力。亦只有任日軍一意孤行退而嚴密保持蘇州河以南的區域。在這樣的情境下。租界的中立地位早已被日本的軍事行動完全破壞。但是有一部分外僑。對於上海的戰事。竟向我提出建立中立區的問題。這種行動不是昧於事實。就是另有作用。這次上海戰事對於旅滬僑民。雖有不便。但這責任應由日本帝國主義担任。這是我們要正告各國有關當局及其僑滬居民的。</p>

<h3>Our Air Force's First Battle Destroys Three Enemy Ships, Establishing Great Merit</h3>
<p>Kiao-chiao Shot Down Three Enemy Heavy Bombers * Japanese Base Bombed, Suffering Extremely Heavy Losses * Our Pilot, Ren Yung-ko, Died for His Country</p>
<p>Starting at ten o'clock yesterday morning, our air force was ordered to formally engage in combat, bombing enemy military bases and enemy ships in the Whangpoo River, while also covering our frontline troops' charge and attack. Under the fierce suppression of our army and air force, the enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. Enemy planes fled in panic. Enemy heavy bombers in the Kiao-chiao area of Hangzhou also went to drop bombs and were shot down by us. Three or five enemy planes from Chapei and other places also flew in and were successively repelled, unable to repeat the "January 28th Incident" tragedy of turning Chapei into scorched earth. In our air force's first attack, one enemy ship was destroyed and one was damaged in the Whangpoo River. One was sunk at Yang Linkou, and several bombs landed around the enemy flagship "Izumo," posing a great threat to the enemy. Our air force's combat skills were skillful and refined. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, when our planes surrounded and bombed the Izumo flagship, enemy planes came out to engage, and after more than an hour of fierce fighting, our planes were able to defeat the many with the few, and the entire force returned victoriously. Millions of people stood on the streets in the rain of bullets, cheering. It is truly one of the most glorious air combat histories in the Far East, and it can be said to be an unprecedented air battle in the Far East. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Our newspaper's Changshu urgent telegram on the 14th: It is confirmed that at 9:20 am, a Japanese warship was anchored in the river between Baimao Kou and Yang Linkou, and it was hit by our light bomber. Most of the ship was destroyed. The Japanese warship fired anti-aircraft guns in retaliation, and the sound of gunfire was quite clear in the urban area. Also, more than ten heavy gunshots have been heard here, lasting for five minutes before stopping. It seems to have come from the Yang Linkou-Liuhe Kou area, but the area is very safe.</p>
<p>According to reliable information, at about 2:00 pm yesterday, two enemy heavy bombers flew to the skies over Hangzhou and Kiao-chiao to carry out bombing. Our side received advance notice and was prepared, so when the enemy planes attacked, they were immediately surrounded and shot down by our air force. One of our fighter planes was also damaged.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Hangzhou, 14th: At 5:00 pm on the 14th, eleven Japanese twin-engine heavy bombers flew from Taiwan to Hangzhou and dropped bombs on the aviation school. Our air force team received advance notice and immediately retaliated. Three enemy planes were shot down, one landing in Cheshan (place name), one in Xiaoshan, and one near the Qiantang River. Two pilots escaped and were captured by us. Our aviation school had already prepared in advance and everything had been moved, so there was no damage. The remaining eight enemy planes then flew to our Kuangte airfield to bomb, only injuring two of our soldiers. One plane parked there suffered minor damage to its tail. However, these eight enemy planes were retaliated against by our air force, and five of them were severely damaged and fled in a panic, crashing in Chekiang Province one after another. A search is currently underway. It is also reported that the remaining three enemy planes flew back to Taiwan via Wenzhou at about 8:00 pm. According to later reports, the five damaged enemy planes that escaped landed near Lanxi because their gasoline ran out.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Nanjing, 14th: Aviation sources say that the Japanese side dispatched eleven heavy bombers from Taiwan to Hangzhou at about 3:00 pm on the 14th to drop bombs. Two of them were shot down by our air defense forces, and the remaining nine escaped. It is heard that the damage in the bombed area of Hangzhou was minimal. Also, it is reported that after the Japanese planes fled, they flew to Anhui's Kuangte to drop bombs. The losses are not yet known.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that a certain military agency in this city received a telegram from Minister He stating that yesterday at about 2:00 pm, two Japanese bombers first went to Hangzhou to carry out an air raid, and our air force bravely fought and completely destroyed them. However, our plane was also slightly damaged.</p>
<p>Fierce Air Combat Above the Whangpoo</p>
<p>At 3:50 pm yesterday, three of our air force planes took off again over the city, still targeting the Izumo flagship for bombing. They first made a brief reconnaissance around the ship, and then proceeded from the east, west, and north, launching bombs at the enemy ship. The enemy ship was thrown into chaos, wildly firing anti-aircraft guns and machine guns at the sky. However, our planes moved very nimbly, flying at an altitude and distance that just reached the limit of the enemy ship's range. At the same time, six enemy seaplanes also scrambled to respond. Our planes bravely engaged them, and the unprecedented air battle in the Far East over the Whangpoo River was presented before the eyes of thousands of citizens. Our planes' techniques were refined, with the fastest movements, sometimes soaring high, penetrating the clouds, sometimes flying low, skimming over the top. The strategies adopted were either a general offensive, an encirclement, a pincer movement from front and rear, or an attack from both wings, all causing the enemy planes to panic and be unable to attend to both sides. Our army launched more than ten attacks on the enemy ship, and the enemy ship fired more than a thousand shots. The enemy ship suffered heavy threats from us, was severely damaged, and was in a state of utter disarray. Our planes were never hit. This air battle was extremely fierce, with the sound of cannons like a string of pearls, the sound like thunder, black spots densely layered, and smoke filling the sky. The battle lasted for an hour and twenty minutes, and our army declared victory at about 5:10 pm, flying away triumphantly. During the fierce battle, millions of people and Westerners gathered along the Bund and nearby to watch the battle without fear. Furthermore, our air force's first operation inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, truly opening up a glorious record in our country's military history, so everyone cheered with joy to boost their morale. Wangping Street happened to be the time for the evening newspaper to be released, so the citizens were particularly crowded, all stopping to look up. At that time, the sound of the planes rattling, mixed with the rumbling sound of machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, and stray bullets flying in the air, danced down to the center of the street. Citizens were injured and began to flee in panic, and order was inevitably disrupted, but the joy was fully expressed on their faces. A chorus of "Long live the Chinese Air Force" in the crowd proved the patriotic sincerity of the people. At about 7:00 pm, one of our planes flew in for reconnaissance again, and the enemy ship began to fire wildly without waiting for our plane to approach, and its stubborn resistance and panicked behavior were clearly visible.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Ships Hit and Exploded</p>
<p>At about 4:40 pm yesterday, another team of our air force warriors in Yangshupu drove combat planes to reconnoiter in that area. Three Japanese warships were moored on the river surface, and five or six anti-aircraft guns fired simultaneously at the same altitude and angle, attacking our planes. The shells exploded in the air, like plum blossoms just blooming. But at this time, our loyal and brave flying generals were calm and composed. When the enemy shells exploded, they stopped advancing, immediately lowered, safely crossed under the exploded shells, and repeatedly rose back to the original place. In an instant, they lowered and flew low together, and when they approached the Japanese warship, the bombs of each plane fell together, hitting two ships, and then they turned back. The sound of the bombs exploding was like thunder, and the spray of the Whangpoo River splashed on both sides. It was later learned that one ship had been destroyed and one ship had been damaged. Only outside the Wusongkou, two Japanese planes flew up, trying to pursue our planes, but at this time our planes had already completed their mission and returned to their team.</p>
<p>Bombing the Japanese Headquarters</p>
<p>Our country's air force was ordered to dispatch at about 10:00 am yesterday to participate in the air battle, and the Kung Da Cotton Mill of the Japanese company near the base of the 𣓾 Tree Spring and the Military Labor Road was the base for the Japanese army in the eastern district, and the headquarters of the Japanese army was also attached to it. Therefore, in order to control the battle, in addition to the army's advance to the east from Chiangwan in the morning to attack the enemy, our air force plane squadron also flew to Yangshupu to bomb the Japanese army headquarters and strafe it with machine guns. The enemy army suddenly suffered a pincer attack from our air and land forces, suffering heavy losses. Yesterday afternoon, after our air force bombed the enemy warships and their rear defenses, by about 7:00 pm, the first, second, and third Kung Da, Shanghai, Tung Hwa, Yu Feng and other cotton mills where the Japanese army was stationed were completely destroyed. Tung Hsing Cotton Mill was hit by two bombs and was severely damaged. The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that Chinese military aircraft invaded two times today (the 14th), and two bombs hit the Kung Ho Hsiang Dock Company during the second time, injuring seven Chinese and one foreigner, an accountant named Hyde. According to the company's supervisor Grant, the attackers totaled plane squadron, and the company's buildings were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Our Planes Surround and Attack the Izumo Flagship</p>
<p>At about 10:30 am, two squadrons of our air force, a total of six bombers, were ordered to reconnoiter in the area of the Pootung side. At that time, the Japanese flagship "Izumo" moored in the center of the Whangpoo River fired anti-aircraft guns at our planes. However, our air force soared very high, and although the Japanese warship exerted threats, our army launched three bombs at the ship, but due to the great wind, the bombs were blown by the wind, causing the target to be slightly off. One bomb landed in the river, splashing waves and overturning three barges. Two bombs landed near the "Izumo" on the Pootung side, causing the ship to rise several feet and float on the water. However, due to the excessive sound and force of the bombing, the glass windows of the buildings on the Bund of Pootung were shattered. The passengers on public buses and trams were panicked because they did not understand the situation at the time, and jumped out of the vehicles and hid in nearby shops that were not closed. When our planes bombed the ship, all the Japanese troops on the ship were mobilized, and the Japanese gunners aimed anti-aircraft guns and machine guns at our military planes and fired wildly. However, our pilots were extremely agile in their actions. After dropping the bombs, they quickly flashed into the clouds, leaving the enemy ship to fire wildly at us with guns and cannons, but none of them hit. Our planes dropped bombs three or four times and circled for about 20 minutes before flying away. Then, at about 1:20 pm, two of our planes appeared over the Whangpoo River and continuously launched bombs at the enemy ship. The enemy ship was in a state of panic and ordered the wild firing of anti-aircraft guns, densely packed like a string of pearls, firing more than 100 shots in total, but our plane only suffered minor damage when flying back. Stray bullets affected the Waibaidu Bridge and the Bund Park area, injuring many pedestrians.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Pedestrians Injured by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>During the aerial battle between the Chinese and Japanese air forces, Japanese seaplanes even used machine guns to strafe downward in the air, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere. Therefore, there were those who were injured by stray bullets at the Waibaidu Bridge, the Huangpu Tan Road, the intersection of Nanjing Road, the Jing An Temple Road, and near the New World. The total number of people injured was no less than 300, and there were no less than 100 people who were trampled on due to overcrowding and panic. Among them, women and children were the most numerous. At that time, the authorities of the concession ordered all fire trucks to rush out to rescue and send them to Renji and other hospitals for treatment one after another. However, due to the large number of people, it was difficult to perform the operation. The names of all the injured are not recorded due to the length of the article. In addition, there are occasional people who get lost, but the refugee relief center is searching everywhere, so the families of the lost men and women are going to the center to inquire.</p>
<p>Near the Chunjiang Wharf in Pootung, a fire suddenly broke out yesterday afternoon due to stray bullets falling. At that time, white smoke was first seen spreading, and then gradually dissipated, but soon the fire continued to rise, and the flames of the burning were soaring into the sky, and the sky was all red. It was getting more and more intense in the evening, and it was difficult to put out the fire. It was learned that the place was an Asia Petroleum pool.</p>
<p>It is said that the newly built administrative bureau of the Jinghu-Hangzhou North and South Railway Stations was hit by stray bullets at about 6:00 am yesterday, but the location was very small and not important, so there was no loss. * Five Japanese Ships Attack Liuhe and Fail</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that yesterday afternoon, five Japanese warships sailed to Liuhe, attempting to cover the landing and attack of troops. Our air force received the report and flew to bomb, immediately sinking one Japanese warship, and the other four ships were also considerably damaged.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu Replies to British and American Protests</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that yesterday's air battle caused British and American consuls to protest to Mayor Yu because airplanes and bombs fell near their respective warships. Mayor Yu immediately replied that our air force may bomb Japanese warships at any time, and the warships of various countries should stay away from Japanese warships to avoid danger, otherwise our side will not be responsible.</p>

<h3>Chapei Pootung Our Army's Frontline Offensive</h3>
<p>Enemy Positions Surrounded by Our Army * Hongkew Immediately Becomes War Zone</p>
<p>The war situation in Northern Shanghai: After our air force dispatched to bomb enemy positions yesterday morning, our army concentrated its firepower and launched a full-scale offensive. Although the enemy troops relied on solid defensive works to resist stubbornly, our frontline soldiers, from morning to night, all fought bravely and fearlessly, so the progress was quite rapid. At 5:00 am yesterday, the Japanese troops near the Shuidao Road and Chih Chih University were completely wiped out in the rain of bullets. Taking advantage of the victory, they advanced. One team copied to the back of the Nanyang Tobacco Company to attack the enemy. The Kung Da Cotton Mill, the rear base of the enemy army, and the Chiangwan Road Command, the front base, are already in our army's encirclement. Also, at 5:30 pm yesterday, our army bravely advanced from the Kemei Road and fought fiercely with the enemy troops at the intersection of the Ochia Road and Tes Wei Road.</p>
<p>Last night, our enemy and our two armies fought very fiercely, and the sound of guns and ammunition was endless throughout the night. Until 5:00 am this morning, the fierce battle was still in progress. Especially between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am this morning, the shelling on both sides was even more intense. Our army used heavy artillery to attack the enemy's陣, and the enemy also fired artillery from the ships on the Whangpoo River.</p>
<p>Our Army Advances in Front of the Eight Character Bridge</p>
<p>At 9:30 am yesterday morning, it was confirmed that since 5:30 pm the day before yesterday, our army had taken advantage of the victory to attack at the Eight Character Bridge, and after occupying the Chung Hsing Road Bridge again, it continued to advance. The residents in the Eight Character Bridge area have fled. It is very difficult to supply the front. The municipal government and the Anti-Japanese Support Association are currently providing bread for relief.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Fire at Chujiang Wharf</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than ten Japanese warships simultaneously fired artillery at the Chujiang Wharf area with fierce firepower. Our army guarded the defense line to prevent the Japanese army from attempting to land. The artillery fire was even more intense at about 5:00 pm or 6:00 pm. It was reported that the municipal government and other places had destroyed them.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Withdraws from Toyota Cotton Mill</p>
<p>A part of the Japanese Marine Corps has been stationed at the Toyota Cotton Mill in Western Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the war in Chapei and Western Shanghai, the Japanese side has felt that the place is isolated and difficult to defend. They negotiated with the British garrison authorities to temporarily entrust the British army to take over and manage it, and all Japanese employees and workers in the factory were evacuated. All the Japanese Marine Corps were also withdrawn, and the British side sent personnel to search the factory thoroughly for weapons and ammunition hidden in it. It is heard that the municipal government received an official notice from the British garrison authorities yesterday, saying that there were no more firearms in the factory, and that the Japanese would never be allowed to enter it again.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Massacre Residents Seeking Refuge</p>
<p>Since yesterday morning, the Japanese army has been retreating step by step, and the residents in our Hongkew district, who have not had time to escape due to the sudden outbreak of the disaster, have been lying in their houses to avoid it in this fierce artillery fire. The Japanese generation has absolutely no humanity and uses bayonets and broadswords to massacre these innocent residents. Those who were killed by Japanese soldiers on Wusong Road were particularly numerous, so that corpses were piled up and blood flowed like a river, and the tragic situation was even more unbearable to witness. According to an eyewitness on the Bund bank building at the time, the multinational corps stationed at the White Crossing Bridge used a semi-encirclement posture to circle the refugees and protect them across the bridge. This happened several times.</p>
<p>Hongkew Area Police Affairs Suspended</p>
<p>Each police station in the Hongkew area of the Public Concession, such as the Te Su Wei Road police station, has been temporarily suspended since August 12 due to police force allocation. Other places, such as the Chi Hsing Road police station and the Hongkew police station, have also been temporarily suspended since yesterday (the 14th) due to the war. All public officials, except those who have to stay on duty due to official duties, have been evacuated one after another. Someone has also received news from the enemy that the traffic on the east side of Hongkew, Heng Road, Han Bi Li Road, and Ya Yuan Road, will be cut off. It is not known what the intention is. Residents living there should pay attention.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Covered with Gray and Flags of Other Countries</p>
<p>As of yesterday, there were a total of 26 Japanese warships berthed in Shanghai. At 5:43 pm yesterday, a Japanese torpedo boat entered the port again. Because its emblem had been removed, its name and number were unknown. The No. 86 Japanese gunboat moored on the Bund of the French Concession, Jindeyuan, about 100 yards away from our blockaded South Whangpoo side, was originally light lake-colored, but since 3:00 pm yesterday, it was painted gray to avoid being targeted by our air force. Because our air force dispatched and Japanese planes greeted the attack, the warships of various countries stationed on the Pootung surface, in order to make it easier to identify, especially laid the national flags of each country horizontally on the deck to show the difference, so as to avoid misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th: Chang Chih-chung, commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai garrison, telegraphed: All newspapers, transferred to all troops, all agencies, groups, and all compatriots in the country, have reviewed. On the afternoon of the 13th, the violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, and the fleet suddenly bombarded Chapei with heavy artillery, followed by infantry crossing the border and attacking the defense of our Security Corps. Our Security Corps could not bear it and rose up to fight. Chih-chung was ordered to lead his troops to rush to support, defend the homeland painstakingly managed by our ancestors, and strive for the survival of our 450 million yellow-skinned Chinese, and vowed not to live under the same sky with the Japanese slaves. Today's matter is the final settlement of the past four or fifty years since the Sino-Japanese War.

No matter how rampant the violent enemy is, the final victory will belong to me. I wish my compatriots throughout the country to forget the suffering of tens of millions of our compatriots in the Northeast and Peiping who are groaning under the trampling of the Japanese iron hooves, and forget the blood of the loyal and sacrificial martyrs in our January 28th Incident, the Great Wall War, and the Peiping-Tianjin War. With a tragic and enthusiastic spirit, we will jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of washing away the national humiliation and recovering lost land, abide by the instructions of the Supreme Commander Chiang Kai-shek, and with the determination to resist to the end, seek the final glorious victory. Donning armor and making a speech, I can't help but be excited. Chang Chih-chung respectfully deleted the imprint.</p>

<h3>Our Government Issues Statement Regarding the Current Sino-Japanese Situation</h3>
<p>To Safeguard Territorial Sovereignty and Various Treaties, We Can Only Exercise the Inherent Right of Self-Defense; If the Japanese Side Can Stop All Acts of Aggression, We Should Still Strive to Save the Critical Situation Based on Our Peaceful Aspirations</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representing the National Government, issued the following statement today. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese government issues the following statement regarding the current Sino-Japanese situation:</p>
<p>China has been forced by Japan's endless aggression and now has no choice but to exercise self-defense and resist violence. In recent years, the Chinese government and people have worked together to complete the construction of a modern nation, with the aim of achieving a free and equal status. For this reason, we have devoted ourselves to economic and cultural revival internally, and we respect peace and justice externally. China has signed the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and has faithfully fulfilled its obligations, believing that independence and coexistence are mutually dependent and complementary. However, since the September 18th Incident, Japan has seized our Northeastern Provinces. In the Battle of Shanghai, important commercial towns in southeastern China were devastated by war. This was followed by the loss of Rehe, then the battles at various passes along the Great Wall. The disasters of massacre and arson spread to Hebei, followed by the establishment of the bogus organization in eastern Hebei and the training of bandit troops in northern Chahar. China's territorial sovereignty has been severely eroded. Other actions, such as allowing various aircraft to fly illegally within Chinese territory, assisting large-scale smuggling, causing huge losses to Chinese finances and international commerce, and various vicious tactics, such as openly selling morphine and heroin, illegally trading firearms, and aiding bandits, have plunged Chinese society and its people into an inhumane plight. In addition, there are countless unreasonable demands and unilateral acts of freedom. Any one of these is sufficient to endanger the independence of the country and the survival of the nation. We dare to believe that this is something that no country and no people can tolerate. However, China has endured it again and again until now. We dare to say that the reason China has done this is to make every possible effort in the hope of Japan's final awakening. The outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident has dashed all of China's remaining hopes. The cause of the Lugouqiao Incident was Japan's large-scale expansion of the Tianjin Garrison and its repeated exercises in locations not permitted by the Boxer Protocol. Such actions by Japan were sufficient to cause incidents at any time and any place. On the night of July 7th this year, Japanese troops conducted illegal exercises near Lugouqiao, near Beiping, followed by a sudden attack on Wanping County. Our troops stationed there, responsible for defense, pursued rightful self-defense. Our innocent people, unexpectedly, saw their lives and property destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. All these facts are known to the world. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan's actions have been deeply noteworthy, namely, their constant use of rhetoric such as "local resolution" and "not wanting to expand the situation." In reality, large numbers of troops, aircraft, tanks, and various new weapons of war are being continuously transported from Japan, Korea, and our Northeast into Hebei, carrying out military aggression and attacking our territories step by step. These facts cannot be concealed by the rhetoric they use. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Chinese government still negotiated with Japan in good faith, hoping for a peaceful resolution of the incident. On July 12th, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to the Japanese Embassy that both sides immediately cease military action, but Japan did not respond. On July 19th, our Minister of Foreign Affairs formally reiterated the original proposal in writing, agreeing that both sides would determine a fixed date to simultaneously cease military action and withdraw their troops to their original locations. He also stated that the Chinese government, in order to peacefully resolve this unfortunate incident, was prepared to accept any peaceful method of handling international disputes recognized by international law or treaties, such as direct negotiations between the two parties, mediation, arbitration, etc. However, none of the above proposals received a response from Japan. At this time, for the sake of maintaining peace, the local authorities in China had already accepted the solution proposed by the Japanese side. The central government also showed the greatest tolerance and did not oppose this solution. However, the Japanese army, without any excuse, suddenly attacked Chinese troops again at Lugouqiao and Langfang. Furthermore, on July 26th of this year, they issued an ultimatum demanding that Chinese troops withdraw from Beiping. This was a new complication beyond the agreed-upon solution and was something we could not possibly accept. Without waiting for a response and before the deadline, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Beiping, the center of Chinese culture, and Tianjin, the commercial hub of China. Near Nanyuan, our garrison was besieged by Japanese bombers and tanks, suffering extremely heavy casualties. In Tianjin, the lives of the people were brutally massacred, and public buildings, cultural institutions, and merchant residences were all reduced to ashes. Since then, they have continued their advance, invading the southern counties of Hebei Province and attacking Nankou, extending the war to Chahar Province. All of these actions, creating incidents and expanding the war zone, are all covered up by rhetoric such as "local resolution" and "not expanding the incident." While the war in North China is spreading rampantly, the Chinese government, considering that Shanghai is an important metropolis in the East, with the interests of Chinese and foreign commerce and other aspects deeply at stake, has repeatedly ordered the Shanghai municipal authorities and security forces to take extra care to maintain order and avoid any untoward incidents. However, on the evening of August 9th, Japanese officers and soldiers attempted to invade our Hongqiao military airfield, disobeyed the orders of the security forces, and an incident occurred, resulting in the death of one Chinese security guard defending the airfield and two Japanese officers and soldiers. After the incident, the Shanghai municipal authorities immediately proposed seeking a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. However, Japan dispatched a large number of warships, troops, and other armed forces to Shanghai and made various demands in an attempt to dismantle or reduce China's self-defense capabilities. Japanese aircraft arbitrarily flew and threatened Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other coastal ports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and there is no doubt that this was a military mobilization. Since the 13th, the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks on the central district of Shanghai. These actions, along with the transportation of large numbers of troops to Hebei since the Lugouqiao Incident, are all part of Japan's traditional plan to implement its aggressive continental policy, which is clearly evident. Japan still attempts to use the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement as an excuse, which would prevent China from adopting legitimate means of self-defense in this time of national crisis. It must be understood that the spirit and purpose of this ceasefire agreement is to have both sides restrain themselves in a certain area to avoid conflict and facilitate peaceful resolution. If one side violates the agreement and freely advances its troops, while at the same time restricting the other side, forcing it to sit still and be subjected to aggression, this is something that cannot be distorted by any law or human sentiment. China solemnly declares today that China's territorial sovereignty has been severely violated by Japan's aggression, and the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have been completely destroyed by Japan. The greatest purpose of these treaties is to maintain justice and peace. China, as a matter of responsibility, should do its utmost to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and the dignity of the above-mentioned treaties. China will never give up any part of its territory, and when there is aggression, it can only exercise its inherent right of self-defense. If Japan does not harbor ambitions towards China and engage in territorial aggression, it should seek a reasonable solution to the relations between the two countries and at the same time stop all its acts of military aggression in China. In that case, China will still strive to save the critical situation in East Asia and the world based on its peaceful aspirations. In short, we are fighting this time not only for China but also for the world; not only for territory and sovereignty but also for public law and justice. We firmly believe that all our friendly nations will not only sympathize with us but will also fulfill their obligations under the international treaties they have solemnly signed.

<p>[Nanjing] As Long Yun was about to leave Beijing, he hosted the Beijing press corps on the morning of the 14th, including more than a dozen reporters from the Central Daily News, Shen Bao, Dagong Bao, Xinwen Bao, Xinmin Bao, and the Central News Agency. Long Yun first stated that it was difficult for him, living on the border, to come to Beijing. He felt fortunate to have been summoned to Beijing and to have met the various leaders, and he was deeply grateful. He was even more pleased to meet with everyone. Long Yun continued that the current national crisis was extremely serious. He had come here with all possible speed to ask for instructions. Chairman Chiang had already established a definite policy for resisting the enemy, and he had no other opinions other than to sincerely support it. It was appropriate to say less empty words and take on more responsibilities. As a border official, he would contribute all his manpower and financial resources to the country, hoping to kill the enemy and achieve results. Long Yun concluded by saying that this time our country's war of resistance by the entire nation stemmed from self-defense, and the hearts and minds of the entire military and civilians are united. Final victory will surely belong to us, but we must remember not to be arrogant in victory and not to be discouraged in defeat. At this point, all the reporters excused themselves and left.

<h3>War Breaks Out Again in Shanghai, Attracting Worldwide Attention</h3>
<p>Britain, America, and France Are Working to Coordinate; U.S. Authorities Receive Japanese Ambassador; Russia Denies Sending Advisors to China</p>
<p>[London] Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, all the newspapers here have carried news of it in large headlines. The newspapers have also published editorials describing the importance of this matter in international politics. The Daily Telegraph reported that the dangers to international relations were easily overestimated, but the British and American governments were coordinating with other countries to try to limit the war. The newspaper also stated that Japan's forward policy seemed to be controlled by the military, so whether they were protectors of Japan or friends of China, they all hoped that those responsible in Tokyo could regain control as soon as possible, so that they could propose an acceptable peaceful resolution to China before the war worsened. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[London] The Manchester Guardian stated today that the Japanese probably still believed that they could seize another part of China without resistance. The situation did not allow for theoretical discussions, right and wrong were not in question, and there was no need to interpret treaties. Japan had already swallowed the Northeast Provinces without digesting even half of them and was now eyeing North China. It was as simple as that. Our only consideration at present was how to stop Japan. What Japan wanted to demand was often unacceptable in reason and emotion. The decisions of the great powers were inherently difficult, and the Soviet Union was unlikely to take any action without the cooperation of Britain and America. However, it was time for the three countries to act together. Even today, a sternly worded declaration and a jointly proposed mediation could sway Japan. Japan may disregard law and order, but it has never failed to respect and understand the strength, especially the economic power, of these three major countries. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Express reported that although the fighting in Shanghai had intensified again this morning, neither China nor Japan had clearly won. According to the newspaper's correspondent in Shanghai, the Chinese troops were well-equipped, especially their artillery, which was very precise. The Japanese were deeply surprised by the Chinese troops' excellent discipline and calm response. Japan was preparing to launch a major offensive and send reserve troops to participate in the battle to capture Liuhe. (National Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] The Morning Post recently commented on the dispute between China and Japan, saying, "The results of the war will harm both sides. Japan can defeat China, but it cannot conquer it. China can resist without surrendering, but it will suffer great losses. Local conflicts may not lead to a major war, but the situation is precarious and requires careful handling." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the dispute between China and Japan, it was rumored that the British government instructed its Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Dodds, to once again advise the Japanese government to adopt a moderate attitude. Informed sources here recently denied this, saying that in the current situation, this move would have no effect. British diplomatic representatives in China and Japan are maintaining close contact with the governments to which they are stationed and with other envoys in order to protect their nationals. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Hull today discussed the recent incidents in China and Japan with Japanese Ambassador Saitō. Hull called it "a routine exchange of views in an emergency situation" and said that there was no special discussion of the serious situation in the Shanghai International Settlement. When asked whether the United States, Britain, and France would demand that the warring countries not use the settlement as a base of operations for the war, Hull said that he was not aware of any new developments. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Japanese Ambassador Saitō met with Secretary of State Hull today. Saitō declared afterwards that today's talks were about the general situation in the Far East. Hull also told the press that although the situation in Shanghai was very serious, the United States had not yet considered sending troops from the Philippine Islands to protect its nationals there. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Washington] After the conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in Shanghai, the U.S. authorities are now considering evacuating the 4,000 nationals there and have instructed Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the Far East Fleet, to arrange for the evacuation if necessary. Rear Admiral Yarnell said that all the warships in the Far East Fleet were sufficient to evacuate all the American nationals without any difficulty. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French newspapers all commented on the Shanghai war. L'Époque reported that after this conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in Shanghai, people around the world were paying attention. As the situation in the Far East was evolving, the governments of Britain, France, and the United States should try to maintain their acquired rights and their position in the Far East, both politically and economically. Le Temps stated, "Regarding the launch of a large-scale war in Shanghai, the Tokyo government seems to be hesitant and intends to negotiate with China. However, once the guns have fired, it will be difficult to rein in." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to reports spread by Japanese and German sources that the Soviet Union has partially participated in China's military actions and has sent military advisors to China, these reports are purely malicious fabrications and have no basis. (TASS dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Serious Announcement to Foreigners in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Since Japan used the Hongqiao Incident as an excuse to make unreasonable demands on us and attacked our Zhabei garrison the day before yesterday, our army has also launched its right of self-defense to protect the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and to strike back at those who attack us. Fortunately, with the brave resistance of our army and the deployment of our air force, the enemies in the Chinese areas have been completely cleared after a day and night of fierce fighting. However, after retreating, the Japanese army repeated the old trick of the January 28th Incident, using the public concession as a military base to attack our army. Therefore, we were forced to take self-defense actions and fight back. Regarding this, Mayor Yu made a statement to the consular corps yesterday morning. The statement mentioned, "The Mayor should urge the authorities of friendly nations stationed in Shanghai to pay close attention to the fact that the military authorities of this country hope and request that the relevant parties of various countries immediately stop the Japanese army from using the concession as a military base to attack our troops. Otherwise, if our army is forced to take self-defense actions to reduce the harm caused by the Japanese army's use of the concession as a military base, our country cannot be responsible for all the consequences that arise as a result."</p>
<p>Mayor Yu's statement is a righteous and dignified expression. The concession is originally our country's territory. Its creation was originally only for the convenience of foreign residents, and it cannot be used as a military base to attack our country. However, in order to facilitate its aggression against our country, the Japanese imperialists have used the area north of the Suzhou River in the public concession as a base for attacking the Chinese areas since the January 28th Incident. Because of the pressure from Japan's power, the British and American sides have no choice but to let the Japanese army have its way, retreating to strictly maintain the area south of the Suzhou River. Under such circumstances, the neutral status of the concession has long been completely destroyed by Japan's military actions. However, some foreigners have raised the issue of establishing a neutral zone with us regarding the war in Shanghai. This action is either ignorant of the facts or has other motives. Although the war in Shanghai is inconvenient for the residents of Shanghai, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese imperialists. This is what we want to seriously announce to the relevant authorities of various countries and their Shanghai residents.</p>
<h3>We Will Resist Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi's Remarks in Germany</p>
<p>[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, recently gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, stating: "Looking back to the Mukden Incident in 1931, there was the Shanghai War in 1932, and in the following year, battles also occurred in Rehe Province and along the Great Wall. Furthermore, in 1935 and 1936, Japan repeatedly carried out invasions in the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan in China. All these facts are known to the world. As for the current Sino-Japanese dispute in North China, it is another step in Japan's expansion into the Asian continent. Its aim is to realize the long-held dream of the extremist faction in Japan, which seeks to dominate Asia and surpass the Western powers. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Chinese government has made every effort to resolve the issue peacefully, so as to prevent the situation from escalating further. It proposed that both China and Japan simultaneously cease all military actions and withdraw their troops to the areas before the incident occurred, hoping to open a path for a peaceful resolution. This procedure was originally very fair. However, the Japanese military authorities in North China refused to adopt it and disregarded the advice of some leaders of their country. Instead, they did their utmost to escalate the situation. These military authorities also deceived General Song Zheyuan, making him believe that the Japanese side was sincere in seeking a local solution through peaceful means. Then, taking Song by surprise, they attacked the Chinese troops, forcing them to withdraw from the Beiping and Tianjin areas. Their acts of aggression are therefore extremely obvious. Not only that, but Japanese troops are now constantly arriving in the Pingjin area, and the Japanese cabinet has taken various war measures. It is self-evident that the country is determined to wage war against China in order to fulfill its ambition of control and aggression. If, to this day, peace is completely hopeless, and a large-scale war is inevitable, then China will be forced to resist force with force. The Chinese nation has shown great patience towards the Japanese warlords in the past, but the survival and independence of the Chinese nation are fundamental rights that cannot be sacrificed under any circumstances. The whole country is determined to defend these rights at all costs. The Japanese warlords, especially the so-called young officers, firmly believe that Japan has a 'sacred mission' in the world and monopolize Japanese foreign policy. Their policies can be described as insane and will inevitably lead to disaster. I personally believe that there must be rational and far-sighted politicians in Japan who are aware of this danger. Unfortunately, they are all controlled by the warlords and are powerless. It is hoped that during this critical period, these politicians will resolutely exercise their influence over Japanese affairs. Furthermore, if the Japanese people and responsible politicians can accept world public opinion, then a large-scale conflict in the Far East may be avoided in time. Once this conflict breaks out, it will have an unfortunate impact on both China and Japan, as well as on world peace," he said. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Destroy Educational Institutions</h3>
<p>British Professor Issues Condemnation Letter</p>
<p>[London] Professor Murray of Oxford University, UK, Chairman of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation affiliated with the League of Nations, recently received a telegram from the presidents of various universities in China, condemning the Japanese aircraft bombing of schools in Tianjin. Murray recently sent this telegram to The Times, which stated: "The Japanese troops' destruction of Chinese educational institutions is extremely barbaric. For the sake of culture and humanity, we urge you to condemn this." Professor Murray also attached a letter, explaining that although China is in an extremely difficult situation, it is still committed to the transformation and revitalization of its spirit and culture. This determination is admirable. It seems that the Japanese warlords are specifically targeting universities and middle schools in their war against China. This, from a general psychological point of view, is truly outrageous." (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aggression Causes Anxiety in China's Financial Circles and Frustration in the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Tokyo Authorities Try to Maintain Calm</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Tokyo is making every effort to maintain stability on the surface. All newspapers are forbidden to publish a single word about the movements of the army and navy, and the people are not allowed to inquire about them. The police are also using the Military Secrets Emergency Law to severely punish anyone who gossips or spreads rumors. On the one hand, they are doing their best to incite the public. General "street politicians" are everywhere advocating a strict policy toward China. The heavy industry sector believes that it can take this opportunity to make huge profits, but the Ministry of Finance's recent restrictions on profits have made them frown. The financial circles are extremely uneasy, because they see the financial future as extremely bleak, and the third war budget will soon be proposed to cope with the daily military expenditure of one million yuan. The remaining industries, such as cotton and rayon, have lost the Chinese market and are very frustrated. The stock market has been falling steadily since July 7th, which shows their attitude.

<h3>Director Cai's Message to My Fellow Citizens</h3>
<p>Contribute Strength, Contribute Money, All Hearts United to Defeat the Powerful Enemy</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, issued a "Message to My Fellow Citizens" yesterday regarding the enemy's invasion of Shanghai and the commencement of hostilities, stating: "We have compromised to the utmost for humanity and justice. We have endured humiliation for Eastern Asian peace for six years. Yet, the enemy has not awakened at all. On the contrary, they have advanced step by step and recently used the Hongqiao Incident as an excuse to increase troops and warships, threatening our government and wantonly provoking us. Our army, for the sake of defending the country and protecting the people, has had no choice but to resort to normal defense. Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the East and the most prosperous in international trade, has again been trampled by the iron hooves of the enemy's invasion and turned into a scene of burning and killing. The lives and property of friendly countries are also in extreme danger and are at risk of being destroyed at any time. Tracing the origin of the disaster, all responsibility should be borne by the invading country. Alas! What time is it? Is it not the time for my fellow citizens to rise up urgently to save themselves and save the country? Jinjun is responsible for public security, protecting the territory, and ensuring the safety of the people. He cannot shirk his responsibility. Now that the war has begun, I would like to present several points to my fellow citizens: ① All citizens who have received military training should immediately join various volunteer corps and take on special tasks to assist our army and take on tasks such as air defense, firefighting, transportation, and rescue. Those who have not received military training should also, to the best of their ability, identify a scope of work, cooperate, and contribute their share of strength as citizens. ② All citizens who have financial resources should donate most of their assets to military needs, so that our soldiers who are killing the enemy will not be short of pay, and there will be reliable funds for equipment and replenishment. ③ Reduce personal enjoyment, step up mass production, save and hoard, and requisition all materials to prepare for wartime needs, from food, vehicles, hardware, wood, burlap bags, and oils to scrap copper and iron. All things that can be used for military purposes should be contributed to the country and strictly guarded against being used by the enemy. ④ Traitors, spies, bandits, and all villains, whether they betray the nation, harm the country, disrupt public order, or rob property, all hinder the war effort. All my fellow citizens should do their best to investigate and report, cooperate with the police, and strictly guard against and arrest them to clear the source of chaos, so that the national army has no worries and can bravely advance, kill the enemy, and achieve results. The above matters are what my fellow citizens should do their best to do for the country today. In short, those with strength should contribute strength, those with money should contribute money, all hearts united, to defeat the powerful enemy, advance one after another, and spare no sacrifice until final victory is achieved. This will not only be the good fortune of the country and the nation, but also benefit the peace of Eastern Asia."</p>

The people are enthusiastic and patriotic and share a hatred of the enemy. If your order is issued in the morning, large sums will arrive in the evening, which will facilitate military affairs. This is by no means a small matter. We humbly present our views and respectfully request your review. The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association bows. Seal." It also sent a telegram to comfort Zhang Zhizhong, Commander of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, and all the soldiers, stating: "To Commander Wenbo and all the soldiers: During the 'January 28th' incident, you led the troops and bravely resisted the enemy. Your great achievements are known to all. This time, the ambitious and restless Japan has once again invaded Shanghai. You have once again received a central appointment and led a powerful army to fight them.

The least we can do to repay the soldiers is to send comfort items. ② There are three types of comfort items that we should send. The first category is food and drinks, such as canned food, biscuits, bread, and fruit (to avoid spoilage and enemy sabotage, those who donate these food and drinks are requested to convert them into cash, which will be handled by this association). The second category is clothing, such as flashlights, shirts, shorts, socks, towels, handkerchiefs, toothpaste, tooth powder, toothbrushes, and soap. The third category is medicines, such as first aid kits, Rendan, balm, emergency water, Bagua Dan, and military medicine powder (this item of medicines should also be entrusted to this association for handling)."

<h3>Yesterday's Traffic Situation in the Concession</h3>
<p>Suzhou Creek Bridges Remain Intact, French Concession Opens Small Iron Gates</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Bridges Along the River</p>
<p>Yesterday, rumors spread that the Baidu Bridge and Tianhou Temple Bridge on the Suzhou Creek had been destroyed by stray bullets after Chinese aircraft bombed enemy ships. The reporter decided to investigate around 7 p.m. Driving north along Jiujiang Road onto the Bund, all the streetlights were off, and ships in the Huangpu River were silent and deserted. Only distant fires and the resounding echoes of artillery fire could be seen in Pudong. At the intersections of the Bund and the Great World, a few people and Indian policemen stood by the roadside, looking up at the battle clouds. Around twenty Japanese refugees, carrying their luggage, were crossing the Baidu Bridge from north to south. The steel beams of the bridge were intact. The northern end was guarded by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, preventing passage. Turning west along the Suzhou Creek, the Tianhou Temple Bridge was also undamaged. The Penbian Lane Bridge was still open as usual, but there were few pedestrians, and the tall buildings on the north bank were dark, creating a very quiet atmosphere.</p>
<p>Electric Trams North of the Creek Suspended</p>
<p>Trams on lines 1, 2, and 12 could still reach the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazhi Road to turn around in the past two days. Tram lines 5, 6, and 7 were shortened to turn around in front of the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road. After 10 a.m. yesterday, the war drew closer to the northern district, and the situation became more severe. Therefore, all the above tram lines stopped running north of the Suzhou Creek. The trolleybuses on line 18, which ran between Xie Bridge and Xia Hai Temple, had to pass through the northern district, so yesterday they only reached the entrance of the New World.</p>
<p>French Concession Discretionarily Opens Iron Gates</p>
<p>Starting at 10:30 a.m. yesterday, the French Concession only opened the small iron gates alongside the major traffic arteries at the Sixteen Puli, Xinbei Men, Laobei Men, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, Dongxinqiao Street, Minguo Road intersection, Xiaobei Menwai, Baliqiao Road intersection, Nanyang Bridge, Lafayette Road, and other key locations to allow pedestrian passage. All other iron gates were temporarily closed. At 3 p.m., the large iron gates at the Dongxinqiao Street intersection and Baliqiao Road were opened to maintain traffic for vehicles and pedestrians. French and Vietnamese defense soldiers and Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian police officers dispatched by the police station were stationed inside and outside the iron gates. Wooden watchtowers decorated with barbed wire were added outside the iron gates, and barbed wire frames were placed to enhance defenses. Armored vehicles equipped with machine guns patrolled back and forth at the border between the Chinese and French concessions and the French and British concessions to maintain order. The South City was also protected by our security teams and police. The area was very peaceful. From 10:30 p.m. the previous night to 8 a.m. yesterday, the authorities cordoned off the traffic in various locations south of Shanghai for security. After 8 a.m., the situation eased slightly, and pedestrians and vehicles were allowed to pass in the vital areas of the Chinese and French concessions. At 10:30 a.m., Japanese artillery fire intensified, and enemy ships fired anti-aircraft guns, causing deafening sounds. Traffic was cut off again. At 2 p.m., the iron gates of the French Concession were opened, and the main roads were reopened. All tram and bus lines in the southern city were completely suspended. The South City was closed to traffic at 10 p.m. Regarding traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, passenger trains departed from the South Railway Station at 8:30 a.m., 9:30 a.m., 4:30 p.m., and 6 p.m. as usual. Passengers were extremely crowded, and those traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and other places also took trains from the South Railway Station.</p>
<h3>Four American Warships May Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>According to the English-language American newspaper, four American warships are currently heading to Shanghai.

The other three ships are expected to arrive within two or three days. Once they all arrive, there will be as many as six American warships in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>No Curfew in the French Concession Last Night</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department, considering the seriousness of the situation and to maintain security within the concession, selectively closed the iron gates at the border between the Chinese and French concessions, while the side doors remained open. The possibility of declaring martial law is still under consideration.</p>

General Zhang had recently requested leave for recuperation, but due to the tense situation, he was reappointed to his current position to once again perform the heroic act of resisting Japan.</p>
<h3>Tragic Plane Bombing at the Entrance of the Great World Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Giant 100-Plus-Pound Bombs Fell, Tragically Killing 445 People</p>
<p>At 4:35 p.m. yesterday, during an intense aerial battle, two giant bombs, each weighing over 200 pounds, unexpectedly fell from a plane in front of the entrance of the Great World on Edward Road, near the traffic lights in the middle of the road, immediately detonating.</p>
<p>The sound shook all of Shanghai. At that time, the road was congested with vehicles and people were crowded together. The Great World refugee shelter was already full, and some refugees were waiting at the entrance for transportation to other shelters, leading to this disaster. Limbs were broken and corpses lay everywhere. From Hangzhou Restaurant in the east to the Shanghai Moving Company at No. 876 in the west, from Hengmao Lane on Min'ti'niyin Road in the south to the intersection of Yuqiaxiang Road in the north, almost everything was covered in blood, brains, and liver. Branches of Chinese and Western pharmacies</p>
<p>Were hit and caught fire. The windows and doors of various shops further away were completely shattered by the blast. The French police officer directing traffic on the traffic light pole was also killed. After the French police station heard the alarm, they immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order. More than a dozen Chinese Boy Scouts also rushed to assist, temporarily cutting off traffic. At the same time, the French Concession Fire Brigade, various hospitals, and various charitable organizations sent personnel and vehicles to provide assistance. At that time,</p>
<p>The number of dead and injured was about 400 people. The French Concession Fire Brigade personnel continued to clean up until 8:30 p.m., but had not yet finished. Five incomplete corpses remained at the western corner of Yuqiaxiang Road. A truck was destroyed by the blast in front of the Shanghai Moving Company (British Concession No. 17098, French Concession No. 11057, Shanghai Municipal Council Permit No. 13207). The driver and an assistant were killed in the truck.</p>
<p>The tragedy was unprecedented. Over 40 rickshaws and 20 or so cars were destroyed. Apart from most of them having been moved away, several vehicles, including Concession No. 694, 1031, 8385, Shanghai Municipal Council No. 8190, 2235, Shanghai Municipal Council No. 92XX7, 1455, Shanghai Municipal Council No. 634, 1522, Shanghai Municipal Council No. 2252, 3064, Shanghai Municipal Council No. 1684, etc., were mostly destroyed and left by the roadside. In addition, there were three cars with only steel skeletons remaining, which had not yet been removed. Around 11 p.m., the French police thoroughly</p>
<p>Investigated and found a total of 445 dead. The Tongren Fuyuan Benevolent Hall and Shanshan Villa were dispatched to collect and bury the bodies. Among them were three seriously injured Chinese police officers, with over 200 people admitted to hospitals for treatment, not including those with minor injuries. The French authorities are continuing to investigate thoroughly. The injured citizens were sent to the Red Cross and Tongren Hospital for treatment. Ninety-nine of them were admitted to Baolong Hospital, including 75 seriously injured and 24 who died from their injuries. Two foreigners were also seriously injured.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 14th: Regarding the incident where two Chinese planes dropped several bombs in the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession on the 14th, causing the death and injury of a large number of innocent civilians, the spokesperson for the military authorities stated that this was extremely unfortunate. The Chinese authorities and foreign residents are very concerned and regretful about this. According to the investigation, when the aforementioned aircraft were attacking Japanese ships and other military targets, they were hit by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, causing the pilot to be injured and the bomb rack to be damaged. As a result, the bombs were automatically dropped in areas that were not the target of attack. This was an unavoidable accident. Not only did the pilot have no intention of dropping the bombs, but it was also contrary to his wishes. The spokesperson continued that it was regrettable that innocent civilians suffered such an unexpected loss. The majority of the dead and injured were Chinese, and there were also a few foreigners who were friends of China, which was particularly regrettable. The spokesperson concluded that orders have been reiterated to the combat troops to avoid battles within the areas of the International Settlement that are used by the Japanese military as bases and in the entire French Concession as much as possible. It is hoped that such extraordinary events that cause harm to innocent civilians but are beyond the control of the Chinese army will not happen again.</p>

<h3>Intense Warfare, All Businesses Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Silver and Money Businesses Request Instructions, Foreign Banks Limit Withdrawals</p>
<p>Yesterday, the war intensified. Major companies, businesses, and factories in the concession, as well as major exchanges for securities, cotton cloth, flour, groceries, and margins, were all temporarily closed. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Industry Guilds drafted four concrete measures to stabilize finance and maintain industry and commerce, submitting them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. At the same time, Chen Guangfu, Shao Yanshan, and other chairmen of the Silver and Money Industry Guilds visited Xu Kan of the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning to request instructions on everything. Whether the member firms of the two guilds will open tomorrow (the 16th) depends on the Ministry of Finance's instructions. As for the foreign banks in Shanghai, they have not suspended operations, but they have limited withdrawals to 500 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Joint Meeting Coordinates Food Supply</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai Falsely Accused, All Committee Members Jointly Clarify</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its second extraordinary joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday afternoon, attended by more than 20 executive and supervisory committee members. It was resolved to (1) establish a food coordination committee to coordinate the city's food supply, and to publicly elect Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Xin'yi, Lu Wenshao, Si De'kui, Zhang Yishu, Chen Guangfu, Yu Zuoting, and two representatives from the military and police joint office as members, and to hold the first committee meeting at 1 p.m. on the 15th. (2) In response to the false accusations and slanders against Chairman Wang Xiaolai by enemy traitors, all executive and supervisory committee members jointly issued a statement and requested the military and police authorities to thoroughly investigate and clarify the matter to correct public opinion. The full text of the statement is as follows: Chairman Wang Xiaolai of our chamber has led national salvation work with enthusiasm and courage, and has long been admired by all sectors. Now, at the beginning of the full-scale war of resistance, Chairman Wang has been working tirelessly, neglecting sleep and food. The people of Shanghai are relying on him for guidance. Enemy traitors have fabricated rumors and designed to frame him. Their intention is not only to slander Wang personally, but also to damage the reputation of the organization and obstruct national salvation work. The members of our chamber cannot remain silent. In addition to requesting the military and political authorities to thoroughly investigate, we also issue this statement to make all sectors aware of the malicious intentions of the enemy traitors and to strengthen their belief in unity and national salvation. Sincerely, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Members Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiying, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Hu Xiyuan, Ge Jieshen, Ye Yinsan, Zhang Peizhen, Tu Kaizheng, Pei Yunxiang, Gu Xin'yi, Xu Wenqi, Lu Zidong, Fang Jiaobo, Supervisory Committee Members Luo Qinghua, Shen Tianhua, Chen Liao Chao, Yu Zuoting, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Shuliang, Wen Lanting.</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations and Hospitals Actively Rescuing Wounded Soldiers and Refugees</h3>
<p>Currently Only 200-Plus Wounded Soldiers Received, Over 50,000 Refugees Sheltered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee and the joint disaster relief association of various charitable organizations have been handling refugee shelters in recent days, and they are extremely active. As the war in northern Shanghai has intensely unfolded, refugees are filling the roads, and the number of those seeking relief has increased dramatically. It is learned that the association sent more than 40 relief vehicles to the South City and various roads yesterday morning. Over the past few days, it has sheltered over 90,000 refugees, setting up over 30 shelters. The association continues to shelter refugees and plans to set up more shelters. The Great World also started sheltering refugees the night before last, accommodating about 10,000 people. At the same time, various hometown associations, schools, and charitable organizations have actively identified shelters and provided supplies. There is no need to worry about refugee shelters. The refugee inquiry office set up by the association is also working very hard.</p>
<p>World Red Swastika Society</p>
<p>The rescue team organized by the World Red Swastika Society departed for Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other places at 6 p.m. yesterday. Yesterday morning, team leaders Wu Zhongcai, Shi Yangjing, Zheng Hui cong, and others led rescue teams to continue departing for the battlefield to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. It is reported that the association has rescued over 5,000 refugees in the past two days, distributing them to various shelters and providing supplies. All wounded soldiers were sent to the Shandong Guild Hall and Gucheng Road Wounded Soldiers Hospital for treatment. These two hospitals can accommodate over 800 wounded soldiers. The rescue teams of the Rescue Committee and others also departed to work.</p>
<p>Chinese Red Cross</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in the city, the Chinese Red Cross has established wounded soldier hospitals and sent personnel to the front lines to rescue wounded soldiers. It currently has six wounded soldier hospitals, and there are also several in Nanxiang and Wuxi. Currently, only over 100 wounded soldiers have been received. The Second Rescue Hospital of the association admitted over five wounded soldiers from the Huangjiadu area of the South City around 10 a.m. yesterday, and another 13 wounded soldiers were transported to the hospital for treatment at 12:30 p.m. In addition, 22 little girls and 54 pedestrians who were injured by the plane bombing near the Great World on Edward Road were also sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Taihe Wounded Soldiers Hospital</p>
<p>The wounded soldiers hospital attached to the city's Taihe Hospital was officially established yesterday. In addition to Ma Xiangbo, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Xiangzhen, and others as initiators, Song Hanzhang, the manager of the Bank of China, has now joined in sponsorship, providing additional assistance. Currently, the hospital's medical affairs are managed by Li Quan Jing. Donations from all sectors have been very enthusiastic in recent days, and dozens of people have gone to negotiate to join the nursing and treatment work. It is reported that although the hospital has roughly prepared medicines and equipment, it still hopes for more donations from all sectors, especially medical supplies, which are most essential. The hospital would also welcome donations of trucks for transportation.</p>
<h3>Urge Rice Merchants Not to Raise Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Price Rises to Sixteen Yuan Per Shi, Grain Sold to the Enemy is Destroyed</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in the city, residents have been buying grain to store in case of emergency, while some unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to profit, raising the price of rice to sixteen yuan per dan. The poor are in a state of panic. Yesterday morning, they held their washing baskets to buy rice from rice shops, making it difficult for all rice shops, large and small, in the concession to cope. All</p>
<p>Shop doors were closed, and the patrol room dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to be stationed in front of each rice shop for prevention. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency met with a certain rice shop at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Haibin Road at 8 a.m. yesterday, which was surrounded by poor people. After the detectives arrived and suppressed the situation, they instructed them to line up in order to buy rice to avoid disturbances, and limited each person to buy no more than one yuan of rice. Also yesterday, the Futai Rice Shop at Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, Qiqi Road, in the French Concession</p>
<p>Secretly sold large quantities of grain to the enemy, suspending sales to Chinese citizens. The nearby residents were extremely angry and destroyed its signboards. However, it is rumored that the shop is still selling its stored grain to the enemy. The city's Anti-Enemy Support Association has sent personnel to investigate, and if it is confirmed, it will be severely punished as a warning to others. Also yesterday, around 10 a.m., the Hengtai Rice Shop at No. 542, North Meibaige Road, in the International Settlement</p>
<p>Was robbed by poor people, but only some retail japonica and indica rice was taken, and no money was taken. The shop, seeing the situation was not good, reported it to the patrol room and opened the shop door. After the patrol room sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate, they left.</p>
<p>Rice Price Limit System: The city's grain supply has always depended on neighboring provinces. Since the tense situation, grain prices have soared. It is reported that a few rice merchants are intentionally manipulating prices, even stopping business and hoarding goods. In order to maintain the people's food supply, the city's Social Affairs Bureau has ordered all rice merchants not to stop business and has limited the maximum price per shi to 15 yuan. Those who dare to violate this will be severely punished. The bureau has also sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Command to issue passes for rice boats, which will be collected by various grain industry groups. It has also submitted a request to the municipal government to forward it to the Garrison Command and military police along the way for strict protection to facilitate grain transportation and maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>East of Waibaidu Bridge Completely Deserted</h3>
<p>Residents of All Countries Have Fled</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the residents of various countries in the Yangshupu area, within the Japanese military area, were still relatively quiet. However, since 2 a.m. yesterday, the artillery battle has been unusually intense. After the Japanese army retreated, the area was in danger of falling into the line of fire. People were awakened from their dreams and fled in droves. At 10 a.m., our air force dispatched aircraft to bomb Japanese warships in Guangpu River. The Japanese warships also returned fire with anti-aircraft guns, and the loud noise was like thunder. The people on Nanjing Road and the Bund fled southwest, like a surging tide. The shops closed one after another, and the shop assistants gathered on the sidewalks to watch. The panic on the streets was similar to that of January 28th. At 11 a.m., the reporter crossed Waibaidu Bridge eastward and saw people supporting the old and carrying the young, shoulder to shoulder, and hurrying to flee, blocking the road. Some foreign men and women were mixed among the pedestrians. Military vehicles heading east stopped at Broadway Road. East of Waibaidu Bridge, there was no trace of people. The side streets were guarded by Japanese plainclothes teams, and there were no disturbances to pedestrians. Around 12 p.m., five or six Japanese soldiers piled up cloth bags in front of the Broadway Mansion, facing Waibaidu Bridge. Their intention was unknown.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Administration Withdraws Post Offices in War Zones</h3>
<p>Jiangwan, Yangshupu, etc., All Withdrawn, Light Class Mail Maintained as Usual</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai war has already broken out. Several post offices in the war zone have been temporarily withdrawn. The Datong News Agency reporter has learned the following information:</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Post Offices in War Zones</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Postal Administration, as northern Shanghai and Hongkou have become war zones, the administration has begun withdrawing its branches in Jiangwan, the city center, Shishan Road, Yangshupu, etc., since yesterday morning. As the city's ferry service has been suspended, the Wusong Post Office has also been shut down.</p>
<p>Maintenance of Light Class Mail</p>
<p>However, the post office is still making every effort to maintain the transportation of light class mail (i.e., letters, postcards, newspapers) sent to the above locations, but there is no guarantee that they will be delivered. At the same time, the Zhenru, Luodian, and Jiading postal branches, which are close to the war zone, are still open as usual. However, long-distance buses on the Shanghai-Taicang and Shanghai-Wuxi routes have been suspended, making transportation difficult.</p>
<p>Outbound Postal Situation</p>
<p>Regarding outbound postal services, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is still open, and light class mail can pass without hindrance. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been rerouted through the Shanghai South Railway Station to Jiaxing, where it is transferred to the Sujia Road for delivery. Light class mail to Ningbo, Dinghai, and Zhenhai has also been rerouted via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway due to the suspension of ship services. Light class mail to Tianjin and Beijing is also being accepted as usual.</p>
<p>Remittances Suspended for Two Days</p>
<p>Regarding remittances, various outlying areas are opening channels to Shanghai as usual. However, from the 13th to the 14th, the Ministry of Transportation ordered a temporary suspension of remittances, savings, and COD services, which will resume on Monday (the 16th). The administration's emergency notice is as follows: Emergency Notice from the Shanghai Postal Administration. It has been ordered by the Ministry of Transportation that all domestic and foreign remittances, savings, and COD services will be temporarily suspended for two days from the 13th to the 14th of this month. This is hereby announced. Director Zha Peilin, Chief of the Accounting Division Glenville.</p>
<h3>The Brutality of Japanese Rogues</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that today (the 14th), Japanese rogues, wielding clubs, knives, stones, and even handguns, are freely roaming the streets of the Hongkou district controlled by the Japanese. This is truly the best form of propaganda for the Japanese. These individuals, upon nightfall, assault any Chinese they dare find venturing out. They also smash street lamp bulbs for amusement. Western police attempts to dissuade them have been ineffective. Around 3:00 AM yesterday, these individuals once again used long bamboo poles to smash all the electric lamp bulbs on Haining Road and North Sichuan Road. Prior to this, they severely beat a blind Chinese beggar. He was only saved due to the intervention of Western police, who rescued him and saved his life.</p>
<h3>Special Seamen's Party Headquarters Moves, Anti-Enemy Association Very Active</h3>
<p>The Special Seamen's Party Headquarters of the Republic of China, due to the inconvenient transportation at its original location on Zhonghua Road, has moved to a new location to conduct business. However, specialized work has been suspended. The Seamen's Anti-Enemy Support Association, on the other hand, is very active. In addition to the participation of all working comrades, its various rescue, transportation, and慰問 (comforting) efforts are also very lively. They also plan to add rear hospitals and are currently in negotiations to proceed, it is said.</p>
<h3>First Special District Court Relocates Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Moving to 384 Beijing Road, Original Site Guarded by American Regiment</p>
<p>The First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road moved to the building at 384 Beijing Road some days ago (the original site of the 通易公司). It is scheduled to begin handling all civil and criminal cases there starting next Monday (the 16th). The Second Branch of the High Court, which shared the same location as the First Special Court, also moved to 22, Lane 155, Weihaiwei Road yesterday and began operations immediately. The two court presidents, Xu and Guo, together with the two chief prosecutors, Zheng and Xiang, issued a notice to inform the public. The female prison within the court, holding convicted prisoners, had already been relocated to the new Caojing Prison. The remaining convicts were moved yesterday by Warden Wang, who rented the building at 696 Jiujiang Road. At 8:30 AM, he dispatched police to transport over thirty female prisoners awaiting trial by car to that location for detention. At 2:00 PM, a large contingent of American troops from the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, fully armed, entered the Special Court to garrison, in order to be close for defense, it is said.</p>
<h3>Submarine Cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki Damaged</h3>
<p>The Shishi News Agency reports that after the opening act of the Shanghai War, long-distance telephone calls between Shanghai and Japan were immediately disrupted due to obstacles. It is now learned that the submarine cable between Shanghai and Nagasaki was also reported to be damaged starting yesterday morning. The line was previously damaged by a typhoon, and the Japanese Telegraph Bureau sent personnel to survey and repair the line, which took several days. Unexpectedly, an obstacle has occurred again, causing Japan's only important means of communication to lose contact and be completely suspended. Therefore, various messages are cut off. As for the survey and repair, it is very difficult due to the current war, and the Japanese military feels quite inconvenienced and greatly panicked, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tongji University Relocates Office</h3>
<p>Classes Will Still Be Held as Usual</p>
<p>National Tongji University, located in the north of Wusong Town, has recently experienced hostilities from the Japanese military and the start of the war. The university, as a cultural organization and a known target for destruction by the enemy, was led by its president, Dr. Weng Zhilong, yesterday to evacuate all faculty and students from Songjiang, bypassing the city to Shanghai. They have rented a temporary office at 29 Difeng Road, Jing'an Temple Road, in the Public Concession. It is also learned that all of the university's machinery, instruments, books, and archives have been transported and placed in safe areas. If the wartime period is prolonged, they will still follow the Ministry's orders to move and hold classes as usual, it is said.</p>
<h3>Special District Schools Set Up Refugee Shelters</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Since the outbreak of war, war zone refugees are everywhere. In addition to the Municipal Council joining forces with various sectors to organize a relief committee and doing its best to set up shelters, it also issued a circular yesterday ordering all public and private schools in the Special District to postpone the start of school and instructing them to set up reed sheds on their playgrounds. The Relief Committee will send personnel to open shelters separately, it is said.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and the Yellow Sea are cloudy with heavy rain and strong northeasterly winds. There are cyclones in the Yangtze River estuary, Ma'anshan Island, and the East China Sea. The weather is bad, with heavy rain, due to the southerly wind moving north. The middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River are overcast with heavy rain and variable winds. The center of the hurricane moved to within about 30 miles of 30.30 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM, slowly advancing north by west, with fierce winds. Also, within the 14 hours before 2:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 85.8 and the lowest was 74.3. On the same day last year, the highest was 96.4 and the lowest was 78.8.</p>
