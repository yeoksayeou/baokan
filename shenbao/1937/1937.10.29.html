<h3>眞如孤軍奮勇突圍已撤至蘇州河南</h3>
<p>彭浦我軍亦已安然渡河</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者二十八日晚八時二十分報告、眞如附近、有我軍一部、掩護大隊撤退、於二十六日晚為敵軍包圍、卽集於鎭內抗守、敵屢次猛撲、均為擊退、敵乃以飛發投彈、並在四周縱火、但我軍在烈熖之中、仍屹然未動、昨晨、敵又由東北兩方猛攻、又起激戰、我軍咸抱决死之心、故奮勇異常、憑工事射擊、斃敵甚多、血戰至午後、我軍亦有相當傷亡、且敵機不斷投彈、全鎭已成棄墟、故遂漸向南退出鎭外、冒死衝擊、終為我軍殺出一條血路、向蘇州河邁進、至報吿時、已全部退至蘇州河南岸、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者二十八日午十二時四十五分報吿、彭浦鎭仍在我軍確守中、並與潭子灣沿蘇州河之處，取得聯絡，故雖在敵軍包圍之中、仍拚死奮鬥、與敵巷戰、而昨夜至今午、有數處地雷爆發、敵軍傷亡慘重、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者二十八日晚八時二十分報吿、彭浦方面被圍之我軍一部、向南衝殺、已於本日午後、突破重圍、安然渡過蘇州河、在該處駐守、</p>

<h3>敵犯周家橋不逞</h3>
<p>圖在該處渡河被我擊退　　敵飛機大砲猛轟北新涇</p>
<p>軍息、我軍自閘北江灣方面向西南移撤、早於前日照預定之計劃、配備就緒、乃又由警戒綫循序南移毘連租界西區之點、已將大夏大學放棄、安然退至蘇州河南岸、敵海軍睦戰隊進佔肢處後、於昨日拂曉、圖在周家橋方面渡河、經我軍在砲火之下、沉着應戰、以機關槍掃射、敵終未得逞、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者二十八日晚八時二十分報吿、蘇州河北岸敵軍、於黎明時圖渡河南犯、向我周家橋一帶擾亂射擊、我軍亦沉着應戰、一時槍擊甚密、旋敵見我有備、故卽退去、刻我軍在蘇州河南岸、自租界西邊起、據守豐田紗廠·周家橋·及白利南路一帶、且於江橋鎭已取得聯絡、陣線甚爲鞏固、河上之鐵路橋及中山橋、均經我軍完全炸燬、敵軍殊難飛渡、昨日拂曉、滬西砲聲甚密、蘇州河北岸敵軍、向我海岸北新涇一帶轟擊、並有敵機多架肆行投彈、但我工事絶無損毁、</p>
<h3>廣福方面敵進犯被我擊退</h3>
<p>小南翔至江橋鎮之綫　我密切聯絡陣地鞏固</p>
<p>中央社蘇州二十七日電、廣福施相公廟方面、二十七日晨亦有激戰、惟此處敵軍之動作、在於牽制我兵力、故經我迎擊後、敵卽後退、我軍亦未予窮追、</p>
<p>中央社廣福隨軍記者二十八日午前中時報吿、廣福以北全綫、自二十七日晚至二十八日晨戰况沉寂、惟敵軍大跑飛機、仍施其破壞之暴行、向我全綫陣地轟炸、而飛機尤擾繞不去、我軍鎮靜處之、並嚴密警戒、</p>
<p>軍息、敵軍由閘北大塲、逐漸向西南推進、圖犯我江橋鎮之警戒陣地、故自前晚起、以大砲猛轟、而小南翔一帶、亦有激烈砲戰、派昨日黎明後、敵機結隊在南翔等市鎭投彈轟炸、所有民房、幾無完棟、但我軍仍沉靜據守、且小南翔與江橋之部隊、已取得密切之聯絡、陳綫鞏固、敵如來犯、决難得逞、</p>
<h3>八百孤軍安全無恙我壯士高揭國旗</h3>
<p>食庫堅若堡壘敵進攻不逞　俠義之士昨設法接濟食糧</p>
<p>孤軍奮門、寗作壯烈犧性之八十八師謝團八百壯土、昨仍在謝晋元團長、楊瑞符營長·率領之下、死守四行倉庫、全軍安全無恙、六層高樓之屋頂、昨日傍晚前、並由我忠勇將士、高揭靑天白日滿地紅之國旗、壓倒四週之太陽旗、發揚我大中華民族之浩然正氣、與國家無上光輝、此八百忠勇壯士之壯烈義舉、已博得全滬巾外人士無限之欽敬、並引起最熱烈之注意、而前綫戰事之發展反成視綫之次要、</p>
<p>决定死守再谢撤退</p>
<p>記者首應向同胞報吿者、此全團八百忠勇壯士、雖處於烟火籠罩敵兵四伏之危境中、不但情緒萬分高漲熱烈、而意態亦至從容悠閑、昨日淸晨、駐防該處之英軍、曾再度努力、勸吿我忠勇壯士卸去武裝、退入租界、我忠勇壯士對英軍友愛之好意、雖極爲感激、但彼等已决定死守可寶貴之最後陣地、拚最後一滴熱血　、作最光榮之犧牲、故又堅决謝絕、彼等昨日曾設法遞出信件甚多、請爲寄發、蓋悉爲遺囑也、</p>
<p>態度沉着高揭國旗</p>
<p>記者於昨午五時許、又至蘇州河南岸邊界登某高樓之頂、觀察對岸動靜、此時在附近各大厦之屋頂與窗口作同樣觀察之中外人士、多至不可勝數、對岸之四行食庫、與毘連之大陸銀行倉庫、均歷歷在目、長約五十碼之六樓屋頂上、架有機關附槍一座、蓋爲對付襲擊之敵軍飛機者、屋頂上有我壯士約十人、時而分數巡視、窺探敵軍助靜、時而聚首間談笑、有所恊議、態度沉着悠閑、毫無忽遽倉皇之色、當夕陽行將西下之際、我忠勇壯士忽在屋頂上、高揭國旗、隨風飄展、使四週之太陽旗、黯然無色、此情此景、令人感奮涕零、</p>
<p>俠義之士輸送食糧</p>
<p>前日傍晚、此八百忠勇壯士、曾發出壯烈呼籲，請接濟糖鹽光餅、俾糧食無虞、可資死守、昨日市民自動輸送各種食品、擬往接濟者、絡繹於途、但以敵軍軍四佈、無法通過、莫不懊喪萬狀、有德籍婦女一人、以汽車裝載大量鈣包運往、托英軍代為轉送、並謂彼願源源供給此八百壯士之全部食糧、亦以交通斷絕不果、惟在此全面抗戰期中、我後方民衆、已現前綫將士打成一片、故在萬般艱難之環境中、卒有若干俠義之士、達到輸送食糧之目的、</p>
<p>堅若保壘可資固守</p>
<p>昨日上午、敵機多架、曾飛至上空盤旋、我忠勇壯士、卽發機槍掃射、將其逐去、下午三時許、一部敵軍、又前往攻擊、惟祇從遠處放槍、不敢迫近、各樓坡窗被擊碎者甚多、我忠勇壯士重視械彈、遠過生命、不見敵軍蹤跡、未予還擊、四行倉庫與大陸倉庫、可以瓦通、為鋼骨水泥所構築、堅固不啻堡壘、可資固守、火門俱已堆積沙袋、兩端並築有工事、故敵軍欲圖衝進、尚非易事、聞敵軍已在附近架設三吋口徑之砲位、意欲轟擊、但我亦有恃無恐、敵軍並曾施用火攻、致四週房屋、已悉化灰燼、惟四行倉庫、仍矗立未動，我忠勇壯士欲向敵軍索取代價、以遂其殺身成仁之壯志、當可酬賞、</p>
<h3>後方民衆熱烈關懷</h3>
<p>自我壯士死守不退之消息傳佈後、昨日赴北西藏路一帶探視情形之中外人士、終日濟濟蹌蹌、絡繹不絕、惟河北敵軍、不時放射疎落之槍彈、致流彈四飛、危險殊甚、駐防英軍、已將新垃圾橋封鎖、並在北西藏路與新閘路交叉處、佈置鐵絲網、阻止通行、但駐足而觀者、密密層層、始終不散、可見後方民衆、對我忠勇壯士關懷之切、</p>
<p>上海市商會、以集守閘北四行儲蓄會堆棧內之我軍、誓死杭戰、决志輿陣地共存亡、忠勇奮發、可泣可歌、昨日下午、特冒險設法獻呈中華民國國旗一面、由本市第四十一號女童軍設法送人、請其縣掛屋頂、以發揚找軍為國犧牲之精神、同時並致函團長謝晋元、營長楊端符、表示欽敬，並有靑年救國服務團致函慰問、而本市各團體各機關、復紛紛致送慰勞品、計送交慰勞會請為設法轉送者、有市民聯合會·人和醫院·華商證券交易所計算科同人·公茂鹽棧·鴻福里各戶居民·仁濟醫院·協和洋行·大觀園浴室。五豐染廠·明星印刷科·三陽同人·及王定珍·吳美培·戴祖林·呂何鈞等、此外又有中國通商銀行同人等、食品中以抗敵餅·水菓·食鹽．醬油·罐頭食品等居多、而本埠外僑方面、昨亦有致送麵包·糖菓及自來水等、足見我忠勇將士、孤軍固守、視死如歸、已博得中外人士之無限飲崇、足以昭耀寰宇而不朽、</p>
<h3>外報一致揄揚我軍抗戰精神</h3>
<p>我滬軍後徹非日軍之勝利　今後績戰日難得愉快結果</p>
<p>泰晤士報</p>
<p>中央社倫教二十八日路透電、泰晤士報今日社論對於上海戰藝之最近一幕、有所論列、謂日軍欲使上海華軍局部而有計劃的退却變爲總潰散、殆將感力盡精疲之苦、日軍之最大與唯一目的、在摧毀中國陸軍、使之不復有堅強有效之戰鬥力、茍無以建此目的、則土地縱有所得、亦無多大關係、以目前所知、日軍殊未有趨向此目的之進步、日軍縱已殺死華兵二十萬人、其中或不乏南京所統率之精銳縱謂上海戰事此後不再延長、實則未必如是、然上海之十週血戰、將有一日證明莫已安置中國從來未有的兵力基礎矣、中國軍人、現已從滑稽故事之迷霧中、脫穎而出、此為近世史中之第一次、雖中國軍人大部現猶訓練未充足、武裝未齊備、並因無力置備雨衣、猶携傘興俱、然扼守人所認為不能支持一週之陣地、竟至十週之久、而其退却也、在任何新式陸軍不能抵抗的猛烈砲火轟炸之下、吾人於此將見上海華軍之抵抗、將在中國各處發生精神上影響、不獨今日如是、即在將來亦然云、</p>
<p>每日郵報</p>
<p>中央社倫敦廿八日路透電、每日郵報論上海戰事、謂日本此番勝利、可保全其威嚴、而中國勇敢抗戰時逾七旬、亦可引以自豪，雙方至是、皆可接受休戰血無恥辱、不幸任何一方、似尚未有願意息戰之表小、吾人希望在寒冬屆臨以前、外國之調停、可使雙方咸受範圍、苟戰事不止、則將有蘇聯參戰、而使戰禍蔓延之危險、吾人可依賴互國會議、運用眞疏通調解之最大努力、而使和局克底於成云、</p>
<p>新聞紀事</p>
<p>中央社倫敦二十八日哈瓦斯電、關於中日兩國戰事、自山黨新聞記事報、頃加以社論、仍主張抵制日本貨物、其言有云、﹁中國軍隊在上海熱烈抗戰情形、實乃任何國歷史上所僅見、英美兩國駐在上海防軍、對于日本所進行之野蠻戰爭、祇能作壁上觀、固矣、其對于中國英勇軍隊欽佩實甚、今後日軍賡續作戰、旣與該國軍艦距離愈遠、其所遭受之困難自必日益加重、夷考世界各國歷次戰爭當事雙方、多少均有理直氣壯之處、惟有中日兩國此次衝突實無片言隻字可爲日本寬恕、九國公約會議即當開幕、屆時各國代表自當採取堅强立塲、以維護個際法治、並當領導世界各國一致抵制日本貨物、俾强令該國﹁屈膝﹂、而不侵路中國、質言之、文明各國為抵抗侵略行動、維護一種理想計、自當有所作爲、至少當與中國普通士兵所為者相等﹂、</p>
<p>大美晚報</p>
<p>本市英支大美晚報廿八日晚社許、題為“勝利安在”、原文略謂、﹁華軍經七十六日之浴血抗戰後、閘北不可避免之撤退、終於實現矣、世界人士、對華軍固守閘北若是之久、均表驚異、誠然、華軍威武不屈之恃久力、與夫如火燃燒之愛國熱忱、巳經過一度光榮之試騐、吾人目覩一九三七年閘北華軍之英勇投戰精神、於吾人腦海中、永留深刻之印象、此為日本之勝利而實非眞正之勝利也、溯自滬戰發生之初、本報即指出揚子江沿岸、難以久守、蓋進犯者可利用軍艦鉋火轟擊、雖有堅彈守衛軍隊亦難固守、於一九三二年滬戰時、日軍得迂迴側擊、致使英勇之十九路軍撤至內地、此次華軍陣綫較前爲長目强、日軍側擊已不可能、但華軍陣綫卒以北站為樞軸而移動、雖經較長時間之抗戰、終亦造成撤退之結果、華軍州次最終退出北站者、非山於日軍之直接進襲、而因日軍突入西北區域、使華軍有被截斷之虞有以致之、華軍作戰之奮勇、空前未有、足永垂靑史、而閘北孤軍之死守、尤為世人所推祟、茲者尚需數日、始克明瞭雙方之戰路、蓋此次局面與一九三二年逈然不同、彼時華軍撤退後、戰事即吿終止、而此次則戰區益形擴大、而戰事亦必更形激烈也、（中略）雙方血戰、已兩月有半、蒙重大損傷者厥爲非戰鬥人員、此為日本瘋狂帝國主義者在中國境內進行侵略行為之收穫也、日本企圖覓求友誼、反招致中國人民之仇很尋求商業上之繁榮、反而耗費數百萬之軍費、此後二次之進攻、當亦確有多少愉快之結果也云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>衛國健兒的標本</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>閘北我軍前晨撤退時。八中八師謝青元團長楊瑞符營長所率領的忠勇將士八百餘人。奉令扼守要點。掩護移防大軍。在任務完畢以後。本可從容隨大軍後撤。但人人抱定為國犧牲的决心。等到敵人進佔閘北。繼續予以抵抗。最後困守四行堆棧。與追擊敵軍交戰。用手溜彈及機槍殺敵達六七十人之多。敵軍至今還在圍攻中。據這批將士的表示。他們雖在孤立無援的狀態之下。也决與敵人死拚一星期。這種視死如歸的戰士精神。不但為租界上不少的中外人士所目睹。而且傳播開去。也同西班牙戰士死守阿爾卡柴古堡的故事一樣是聳動全世界的耳目的。</p>
<p>這八百餘表顯着沈毅敏捷和勇敢等美德的戰士。正是我無數衛國健兒的標本。這是使大家相信中國軍隊雖在極惡劣的環境之下。也決不會給敵人打敗的。最近閘北的放棄顯然遠說不到是敗北。</p>
<p>我們儘管讓敵人向世界誇耀。皇軍佔領某地某地罷。現在北平的近郊。我們幾千的挺進隊還在活躍着。使敵人感受到極大的威脅。四行堆棧裏的八百餘人。同樣地牽制着閘北方面相當數量的敵軍。單在前昨兩天已使敵人嘗到不小的苦味了。我們可以斷言。在被佔領的任何領土上。敵人是一天也不可能安枕的。</p>

<h3>九國公約會議邀請俄德參加</h3>
<p>日拒出席無碍會議進行　美國態度不致有所變更</p>
<p>⊙比京　　比利時政府頃與九國公約各簽字國之允參加九國公約會議者、商得同意、正式邀請德國與蘇聯派員參加、請書已於本日發出矣、（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙比京　衆信九國公約會議之展期開會、不致廷緩會議之進行、因照原定計劃、十月三十日舉行之第一次會議、不過徒具形式、以决定向德蘇兩國分致請柬、此後卽休會三日、以待俄德兩國覆文、衆料十一月三日會議正式開幕時、德蘇代表當可列席、日本之拒絕參加早在意中、故未引起眞正失望、據一般人意見、如意德蔔三國不為日本辯護、阻撓會務進行、則日本不出席、可使會議更迅速行使其工作、至於國聯中日問題諮詢委員會本定十一月五日開會、茲已無期展緩、至九國公約會議完畢後、再行召開、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］美國出席九國公約會議主席代表台維斯今日抵此之後、卽與美國駐法大使蒲立德約期會晤、大概二氏將討論遠東問題云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>美仍持旣定態度</h3>
<p>［華盛頓］關於日本拒不參加九國公約會議事、美國務院雖未加以評論、但各觀察家均謂美國態度、並不因之有所變更、仍當與其他各關係國賡續合作、九國公約會議他日倘有廷宕時日情事、美國並當加以反對、至於日本拒不參加會議之舉、殆與該國軍隊昨在上海獲有勝利一事有關、前當該國𢬶入中國東三省時、每次在軍事上獲有進展之後、必在外交上態度愈益强硬、以今例昔、如出一轍云　此外赫爾國務卿亦拒不表示意見、僅謂日政府送達比政府之復文、此間尚未獲覩全豹云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］衆認羅斯福總統所宣佈使九國會議調停中日衝突之目的、現因日本之拒不參加會議、縱非陷不於可能、亦為極難實現之地位、美國孤立派本不贊成預聞外事、但聞羅斯福總統召開九國公約會議、以和解為目的之說　後不復堅持異議、茲形勢旣變　美國或有被牽入漩渦、採用威脅計劃之虞、孤立派見此情形、或將復唱謝絕外事之高調、此亦美總統所引為憂慮者、其實舍調解而外、有何步驟之問題、殆未考慮及之、或料將來將提議一種和平的譴責、如召回大使等事、惟據現象察之、蓋政府並未以此種政策之事前考慮、束縛美代表團之手腕、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>艾登將親自出席</h3>
<p>［倫敦］關於九國公約會議事、外相艾登昨日午後在下議院宣稱、余當親自率領代表團前往出席、其他代表係海外自治領大臣馬爾康麥唐納與外務部帮辦賈德幹爵士（前駐華大使）（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國會人士頃宣稱、英政府希望此項會議、能在首相張伯倫十月二十一日演說時所指定之範圍以內、獲有成就、（按首相演說略謂、英國參加九國公約會議、志在覓求和平、並非擴大戰事、當務之急乃在考慮以何項共同行動、而獲得和平解决方案云云）此外美政府見解如何、英政府亟欲有所了解、並願美國遇有機會時、能在會議中有所發動云、又艾登外相親任首席代表、渠若離開比京、則由馬爾康麥唐納代理首席代表、此在政界人士對於麥氏被任代表一舉、頗為重視、綠英國各自治領均有代表出席會議、茲麥氏以自治領大臣資格參加會議、當能與各該代表互相融洽也、（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>研究替代華府約</h3>
<p>［巴黎］據今日此間消息、因九國公約會議之開會期日見逼近、主要各國現皆從事研究一種澈底代替華府各約之辦法、蓋自日本奪取東北四省之後、華府條約之體系、已為日本摧毀無餘、再則中日之爭端、卽使調解有辦法亦將東亞之國際關係、另置於一東新條約基礎上不可、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>日覆牒措詞牽强荒謬</h3>
<p>不恤一意孤行　反對列强干涉</p>
<p>［東京］日外務省今日對比政府邀其出席九國公約會議一舉、正式予以拒絕、措詞牽强荒謬、唯有暴日始說得出、大意謂、此一會議與精神上贊助中國之國聯所發動、故日本不便參加、又謂日本在華之行動、純出於自衛、非九國公約會議所得加以拘束、再國聯對日本向無好感、則北一會議對於日本之立場、必不能爲公正之討論、最後列强干涉遠東事情、必使遠東問題愈益不易解决、總之、其口氣之間仍以東亞主人翁之地位自居、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>英表惋惜</p>
<p>⊙倫敦　此間對於日本拒絕參加九國公約會議、表示惋惜因日本此舉、將使調解工作更見困難也、據悉屆時或將請他國居間、以會議之狀况通知東京而居間國家、當以德國最為適宜云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>法報非難</p>
<p>⊙巴黎　關於日本拒不參加九國公約會議事、法國左右兩派各報頃一致加以非難、急進社會黨事業報載稱“此項會議所負之任務、乃努力進行調解、以冀結束中日兩國戰事、日本政府若果出而參加、詎非計之得者、所惜該國老成持重之政治家、已因軍部掣肘而無法爲力耳、日本進攻中國原非正當之舉、中國在自衛上所需之通常器械、若果不虞匱乏、則日本帝國之墳墓、必掘于中國境内、自無疑義可言、據日本某某政治家在私人函件中所述中國若果賡積抗戰、則戰事結束之際、或即日本樹立共和政體之時、亦未可必、”右派小日報稱“日本軍部以為拒不參加會議、實有百利而無一害、于以見　國適在軍事上獲有勝利、即恐有人予以制止、爰乃一意孤行、特沉迷之日本帝國主義必有後悔之日耳、”右派時代報載稱“日本雖會聲明對於中國、并無領土野心、但此項聲明已因該國對華作戰範圍之大而矢其效力、茲該國又復拒絕參加九國公約會議、遂使一般人對於日本野心所抱之憂慮、獲得證實、爲今之計制裁手段既無法予以實施、自屬不合時宜之舉、五人所可希冀者、亦唯進行調解而已”云（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意否認加入日德防共恊定</h3>
<p>［羅馬］此聞報紙對於意大利行將加入德日防共恊定之傳説、絶對否認、以爲毫無根據、（二十七日中央社電）</p>
<h3>英閣議討論遠東局勢</h3>
<p>內容未傳洩於外　仍圖對日優容歟</p>
<p>［倫敦］英內閣今日會議、對於遠東局勢討論頗久、午前集議兩小時半、午後又開會一小時半、討論共歷四小時之久、惟其內容尚未傳洩於外、（中央社二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］內閣昨日開會時、會將九國公約會議問題提付討論、各觀察家以爲英國對於任何制裁主張、均當加以反對、日政府雖已拒絕參加此項會議、但關係各國仍可進行建設性質之工作、換言之、卽㊀中日兩國他日若果簽訂協定結束戰事、關係各國對於日本自可施以壓力、藉以减低該國所可提出之要求、㊁關於在華利益保護事宜關係各國可藉以交換情報、㊂關係各國並可磋商合作方法、俾為各該國屬地之與戰區相鄰近者、設法保障安全、（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>敵封鎖我國海岸</h3>
<p>海道貿易影響微</p>
<p>［舊金山］根據太平洋學會今日所發表之統計、日本此次封鎖中國海岸、對於中國之海通貿易、影響實微乎其微、五年以來中國船隻之運輸數額、僅在全部海運百分之二十五至三十之間、目對於戰事更無關係、因中國輸入之軍火器械、向來均山外船運輸、若以海運貨物之噸數計算、則去年英國居首、達四千一百萬噸、估百分之四十一有餘、現在英國之對華貿易、當不容日本加以阻撓、日本次於中國本國之船隻、居第三位約百分之十五有半、此數較之一二八戰事以前、已增加百分之五、美國則向來甚少僅得百分之一、總而言之、日本旣不能侵犯他國船雙之自由、則所謂封鎖云者、僅徒有虛名而已、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>倫敦市民捐款踴躍</h3>

<h3>紐西蘭總工會主張抵制日貨</h3>
<p>⊙威靈頓　兹據紐西蘭總工會會長今日之報告、紐西蘭總理薩維治、茲已答復總工會之條陳、聲明種種不能抵制日本航業之理由、該勞工領袖復稱、總工會之代表曾向內閣聲明、倘國際總工會决定對日斷絕商業關係、紐西蘭之總工會應即令紐西蘭之工人採取　致行動、同時總工會已致函於國際總工會、詢問其他各國對終此事之態度、並竭力主張國際間對於日貨應一致抵制云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>對華侵略戰爭日本危機四伏</h3>
<p>元氣極大消耗國際地位低落　二十年內决無餘力向外發展　—美軍事專家之觀察—</p>
<p>［華盛頓］傳此聞軍事與外交專家今日觀察、日本在中國之戰爭、無論勝敗或退出中國領土、必使日本於二十年內無力南窺非律賓、蓋於此一戰爭之中、日本之財力與人力必有極大之消耗、故决無餘力更向他處發展即使日本於此戰之中、憢悻獲勝、能控制華北極大之土地、但開發此一塊廣大土地所需之資金、又將使日本陷於竭蹶之地位、即有力為之開發矣、則亦必須期以相當之歲月、而後始能有所收獲、但於此戰之中假若勝利歸於中國、則日本不僅　“大丟其臉一、而喪失其一等强國之地位同時更將引起其國內之大革命、使其陷於長期之內亂中、更無餘力向外發展、再則蘇俄正窺同日本之旁、隨時有與日本發生衝突之可能、故日本於對華作戰中、次不能將氣力用盡、以啟後顧之憂、最後美國對於菲律賓尚未至全然放棄之時、日本當然不敢於同時期內向各方嚴重、以增危其地位、故於此後二十年內、日本决無餘力南窺菲律賓云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>中國如能持久抗戰</h3>
<p>必將促起日本革命　法國政論家之觀測</p>
<p>［巴黎］今日勞慟報刋載遠東政論家泰波伊夫人之論文稱、倘中國能繼續　長期抵抗暴日之侵略、則“將來終止兩國間戰爭者、或為一日本共和國”云、夫人復稱、彼自日本大政治家多人接得之私人函件、對於此點確已有相當之表示云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>意首相演說又倡和平口號</h3>
<p>聲援德殖民地要求　表示繼續反共戰爭</p>
<p>［羅馬］意首相墨索里尼今日在墨索里尼廣塲向　十萬人演說稱、自今日開始之第十六法西斯年、其口號爲和平　墨氏稱、此“和平”二字、已被所謂民主國家者誤用、惟吾人用之、始有深切而合乎人道之　義、因吾人曾出而戰爭、並有重大戰爭之準備　云、墨氏後稱過去十五年之結局、爲羅馬帝國之重興、且並未曾受他國之援助、墨氏又謂、“如和約中之殖民地條文、實有修改之必要、因偉大如德國之人民、在世界上應有相當之地位”、墨氏據此言時、並未提出究指何種殖民地條文而言者、墨氏言畢、即向大衆介紹希特勒之代表希斯、羣衆予以熱烈之歡呼、後墨氏復提及德國之訪問、謂、德意友誼今已益見鞏固、共產主義須目歐洲驅際云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於意首相本日之演説、政界人士頃加以評論、略謂意國既欲剷除歐洲之共産主義、又欲維持和平、可謂自相矛盾、意欲剷除共産主義而不出於戰爭、其道何在、殊非英國人士所能　解也、至墨索里尼　助德國殖民地要求之一層、政界人士以爲英國準備就恢復德國殖民地一事加以考慮、但有一先决條件、即德元首希特勒必須表示其和平之志願是也云（中央社二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>焦土抗戰與犧牲的决心</h3>
<p>— 鄭振鐸</p>
<p>北部的天空全爲灰白的和濃黑的烟柱所瀰漫。幾里路的蜿延的烟柱，沒有一點間隔的地方。</p>
<p>修羅編的閘北！人問的地獄。</p>
<p>烘烘的火光，從烟柱裏透出，染得遍天遍地的紅。</p>
<p>英勇無匹的將士們還在作殊死戰，不肯退却！</p>
<p>在紅光裏可看出半堵的頹牆，缺了屋頂的斷柱。</p>
<p>濃烟裏捲着紅紅的火舌，濃烟外是淡紅色的烟燄。</p>
<p>到早到晚，蜿延的烟火在燒着，在燬滅着一切。</p>
<p>聽不見一聲悲歎，看不見一點的淚水。</p>
<p>憤怒把淚水都燒灼乾了！沒有什麼可留戀的，可悲歎的！只有益堅强了抗敵的心，益整肅了抗敵的意志！</p>
<p>犧牲的决心，决心的犧牲！</p>
<p>原來是抱着“抗戰到底，犧牲到底”的决心來開始全面的抗戰的。</p>
<p>烘烘的火光，蓬蓬勃勃的濃烟正象徵着大上海市民們的抗敵决心的蓬勃和勇毅。</p>
<p>閘北現在是被火餤所包圍，所燬滅了！但閘北却永不會燬滅！她像鳳凰似的將會從火灰裏再生；將會更毛羽輝煌的再生起來而翔翔于天空的。</p>
<p>“一二八”的閘北的毀滅，只有更堅决了大上海市民們的抗敵的意志。現在“十·二七”的火燄更將煽熾了他們的堅定的犧牲的决心。</p>
<p>决不瓦全！只有玉碎！</p>
<p>前敵將士們在一百架以上的敵機的集中轟炸，無數尊遠射程海陸大砲的集中攻擊，幾乎沒有五尺以內的不被翻轉的泥土的情態之下，堅守了七十多天，其勇毅，其大無畏的精神，將永為國魂再生的標幟，將永為驚天地，泣鬼神的不朽的偉業。</p>
<p>而大上海的市民們的這塲犧牲，恰好如鎔鐵似的與之相配合，而凝結成我們民族的光榮。</p>
<p>决不留一片瓦，一塊可庇風雨的小屋給敵人們佔領去！</p>
<p>他們前進一步，那一步所踏到的土地便是焦土！</p>
<p>七十多天的苦鬥，六萬多將士的損失，無量數炸彈、砲彈的浪擲，而只換得了一片焦土的閘北。這將昭告他們：中華民族的焦土抗戰是抱着怎樣的堅定的决心和勇毅！</p>
<p>我們不妨一步步的退；但留給他們的却全是一片的焦土。這焦土且是他們的呑下去的炸彈，射陷在胸中的鉛丸。</p>
<p>像獅子搏兎似的，我們一回轉身來時，將見到敵人們的狼狽的退却！呑下去的炸彈必將爆發的！</p>
<p>我們，軍和民打成一片，來保衛我們的大上海！我們永遠抱着焦土抗戰的决心！閘北是成為一片焦土而被放棄了，但大上海必將堅守！堅守到成為一片焦土！</p>
<p>他們如果敢前進一步，那一步必須損失他們六萬七萬的人，七十多天，一百多天的苦鬭，無量數炸彈·砲彈的浪擲·而所踏到的土地却是一片焦土！</p>
<p>何况擋在他們之前郤是著名的“東方的麥格農防禦綫”！</p>
<p>大上海的市民們沒有悲歎，沒有淚水，只有更堅决的勇毅和意志在迎接這不可避免的焦土抗戰！</p>
<p>像獅子搏兎似的我們一回轉身來時，將見到敵人們的狼狽的退郤！</p>

<h3>陳家行血戰十日記（下）</h3>
<p>— 誠</p>
<p>這一天，敵人已知道了我們砲兵的威風，他們爲死裏求生計，在黃昏時候，又用五六百兵力，向我們頓悟寺陣地偷襲，我們×團長在後面指揮，遂將計就計，把陣地放開一個角，讓他們突進來，親眼看見他們似進而非的進來百多人時，×團長馬上用預備隊上的李營包圍上去了，敵人曉得我們是有計劃想殲滅他們的，但他們知道時，已被我們前後左右的槍火擊斃殆盡了，結果只有十幾個人逃回，膏藥旗和他殺人的兇器又丟下了一大堆，這一次最可惋惜的就是當敵人半數進入陣地之後，我們忠勇善戰的蔡營長，他親自帶着一連人，去截斷敵人歸路的時候，與敵人的官長拚了短槍和大刀，不幸陣亡了，本帥又少了一個能戰之將，師長·旅·團長都很悲惜，但是他爲全民族爭了光榮，我們又替他榮幸，</p>
<p>敵因攻頓悟寺·橋亭宅受了挫折，他就把攻擊的重點移到了陳家行，除十二日頓悟寺一度吃緊外，十三日至十六日敵人每天都有四五次以烟幕大砲作掩護，以大部兵力向陳家行進攻，因爲陳家行是我軍陣地之重點，我事先已有充分之兵力配備於此，固守陳家行的將領，是×副旅長和××兩團長，這三位將領都是富有作戰經驗，於屢次大戰中迭著功勳的軍官，所以雖然敵人以强力來猛攻，但我們絕對有保守陣地的把握，敵人每次進攻緊急時，這三位將領都親自帶着機關槍，在緊要的地方去堵擊敵人，作戰之神勇，指揮之得宣，就是敵人見了也很欽佩，在十五日正午，敵人將陳家行的東北角的陣地突破了，我們當時沒有管他，等到夜半，敵人都放心睡眠的時候，我師長調集了十幾門迫擊砲，抽了最精銳一營人去反攻，這位營長姓張，他也是山東人，作戰頂奮勇，我們十幾門迫擊砲，一齊發射了二百多發砲彈之後，步兵由張營長身先士卒的衝鋒上去了，佔領這個小竹園的二百敵人，多數被砲彈打死，其餘都死在我們的刺刀和手溜彈之下了，當晚敵再行反攻，但是又被我們打退了，</p>
<p>十六日這一天，又是整日的血戰，在正午時，敵調集重砲上餘門，先用烟幕避我視綫，然後砲兵齊發射擊，張營長所守之陣地被敵砲兵擊毀，繼以大部兵力向我猛攻，張營長率部拚命抵抗，斃敵百餘名，敵因受我步砲兵之砲火壓迫，紛紛敗退，張營長見有機可乘，卽出戰壕追擊，被敵槍擊中要害而受重傷，入晚抬至醫院，不幸因傷重逝世了，</p>
<p>敵因費七日之時間，耗去數萬之砲彈，死了五千多人，未能攻破我陣地，乃於十六日晚上對我軍施用毒瓦斯，當時守陳家行東北兩據點的士兵中毒者數十人，我發覺後，即用急救法行施救，死者僅數人，敵人如此慘無人道，全世界實應共棄之，這一天戰况最緊急時，我們師長曾親赴前綫指揮督戰，他已預備好了與陳家行陣地和忠勇的官兵們共存亡，當時傳遍了全戰綫，官兵聞訊無不勇氣百倍。</p>
<p>我們在十七日將防務交給了友軍守禦，接防時是那條陣地，交防時還仍是那條陳地，我們總共殺敵三千餘，得了很多槍支，最使人滿意的，就是臨換防時有×團的弟兄，看淸了有三個敵兵抱着一架輕機關槍，向我陣地前來，這位弟兄倒從側面繞過去，待敵接近時，連擲了兩個手榴彈，三個敵兵都被炸死，他一個人把敵人這架機關槍托回來了，他已經升了中士，師長賞了他四十元錢，像這樣智謀兼全的戰士，眞是稀見。</p>
<p>還有在十二日早晨我兵士一小隊，冒險衝入敵軍陣地，那裏有敵軍高射機關砲雨尊，正在瞄射我們的飛機，我們兵士就奮勇上前，把手榴彈拋去，火花起處敵人屍骸縱橫，兩高射機關砲亦到了我們手中，可惜，那兩尊砲太重了，我們擺不動，後來緊集了手榴彈，把兩尊砲炸毀了。</p>
<p>我們談話至此，適有好幾個兵抬着担架來接他，於是我催他上担架回後方醫治，並祝他早日全瘉，他告訴我說，他很願意馬上恢復健康，再回到前綫殺敵，我們分別之後，我就順便搭了某軍的卡車轉回上海，我在屬此稿時，這位受傷的靑年官的印像，尚縈繞在我的腦際。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>八一三的抗戰。我们早已决定了我們的運命。凖備着大犧牲。大破壞。但是决不事敵人妥協。决不會中途罷手。這是我國軍事當局預定的决策。自開戰以來。將屆三月。敵人以武器的優良。我們自不易得到絕對的勝利。但是敵人開戰迄今。傷亡已七萬餘人。其代領不可謂不鉅。我們於軍事上雖未得到最大的勝利。而軍事以外的勝利頗多。㊀因抗敵而得到民族的統一。㊁戰士們得到豐富之經騐。㊂增加抗敵的决心。以上三點。非特對於軍事上有絕大的希望。並且於民族的精神上。有無窮的樂觀。敵人且慢以眼前之小小勝利自誇。項籍身經七十餘戰。未嘗敗北。面到底自刎於烏江。我們且看這次戰事的結果罷。</p>

<h3>前方與後方（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>於是，記者首先就提出這樣的問題：‘這一回中日戰爭爆發以復，看各方面的客觀形勢，以及雙方朝野表示的決心，彷彿不戰到盡頭，金不會停止的。這樣發展下去，也許會演成世界大戰．那末，在陳先生尊意看來，中日之間，是不是有著戰到某個階段時，先告－個段落的可能呢’？</p>
<p>陳先生說：‘那是可能的’</p>
<p>接著，他就解釋下去：‘中華民族抗戰的最後目的，在於解放和建國。然而，這樣的目的，也許不是一次戰爭所可遠到的。當戰到某個階段的，也許因為各樣形勢的演藝，在某種條件下，使我們能有喘息的機會，暫且告－個段落，以便於下一次的抗戰┆’。</p>
<p>‘那末，所謂某種條件是……’！記者打斷他的話。</p>
<p>‘比如，目本兵自上海的撤退，平津的交還，……等等。不過，內政的干涉，也是不能再容忍的！這樣下去，就是所細偏安的局面了’。</p>
<p>“一般說起來，似乎要‘安’，就是整個的；既然‘偏’，客觀上也就不會‘安’的”？記者試探地補充着。</p>
<p>‘敵人事實上，連偏安也不會允許我們的’。在座的一位父這麼補充了一句。</p>
<p>陳光生就惑啊地說了：‘所以，連偏安的局面、也須要很不客易的掙扎哩，這裏，有三種決定的力量：一是武力，二是民眾的力量，三是國際的支持’。</p>
<p>談話的主題，落到了這次戰爭前途的勝負上。記者於是就趁機向陳先生提出了這樣的問題：</p>
<p>“將目前各方面情勢總合起來看，我們發現不了必勝之點，也呈現不了必敗之點，那末，對於這個為全世界所關心，全中國所焦念的，這一次抗日戰的勝負間題，陳先生尊意，以為如何呢？”</p>
<p>‘我以為，’陳先生說。一單從武力數字上比，我們差得太多了·不過，牧們最有力的武器，還是國際上各友邦的援助，以及發動全國廣大民眾，來作戰爭的後盾。　　記者把自己所知道一點點的，關於各友邦與中國之間的情形，約略陳述一些；以這些為立足點．進而向陳先生叩詢</p>
<p>‘對於不久以前公佈的中蘇互不侵犯協定，陳先生感想怎樣？’</p>
<p>陳先生立刻以激越的聲調說：‘從抗戰實力上說，如巢道一回中．蘇間的所有約文，僅僅止於公佈的道樣的協定，那末，在這時候·實在沒有什麼用處！。</p>
<p>由於歐洲方面國際關係的牽掣，蘇俄決離，以全力援助我們的。反過來說，假定蘇俄眞是明明自白地，站出來援助中國，那末，在目前國際環境下，或許倒反而不利於中國抗戰，也未可知。’陳先生這麼說。</p>
<p>從陳先生話裏，我推測他的意思，大概是中國這一回抗戰，應該極可能地，取得除日本帝國主義者而外的，全世界所有各國的援助，而不應常前先把自已局限起來，使在武力援助上，把一部份國家排出門外。</p>
<p>假如我對陳先生意見的了解，是不錯的話，那末，接下來的問題，就是：這樣希望取得全世界各國援助的念頭，是不是僅僅一個空想？</p>
<p>我就試探地：‘國際上兩大壁壘的形成，已經在急速的進展中。中國要想澈底解放，在未來，一定非利用這個國際形勢不可。不過，從中國目前抗戰上作回想，在國際形勢還沒有充分成熟的前夜，中國似乎還是不必強調這種形勢的好？’</p>
<p>陳先生表示贊同地點着頭</p>
<p>另外，就是關於發動民眾的問題了。</p>
<p>我先發言：‘發動廣大民眾派支持這一次對日的全面持久戰，這，在原則上，看看各方面的意見，已經是一致的。中華民族，要想取得抗日的戰勝，祇有全體民眾發動起來。’</p>
<p>‘是的’。陳先生打斷了我的話，補充著：‘求得日前戰事上的勝利，固然是發動民眾最當前的任務；但，那最大目的，還是在於保證未來的勝利。換句話說，縱使在目前，中國軍事上失敗是難免的，但我們必須抗戰到底，期望獲得最後勝利，那任務，祇有發動廣大民眾才可以負擔。</p>

<h3>全面抗戰下的最後勝利（續）</h3>
<p>— 趙慰祖</p>
<p>第三在軍事方向，日本也處處陷於危境，中國的抗戰，是全民族的動員，每一個人都拿出人力，物力來供給國家，而日本祇是有了幾個軍閥的野心表現，在兵士的心裏方面，民眾的心理方面，沒有堅強的自信力的。我國則連年所受的刺激，對日本的惡感，印象甚深，故人人咸抱決死之心，看這次日本軍人之作戰，多非出之自願，有逃亡的，有自殺的，倘戰爭廷長，一班兵士一定對軍官發生反威。作戰能力全看他一般的心理，心牌不穩定，作戰就不易勝利。現在分類來講：㊀日本黨備兵沒有作戰能力：日本黨備兵只有二十七師團，約五十多萬人，這五十多萬人所持的器械是優良的，但是這現役的五十多萬人卻有大部分的心理不堅強戰爭少經騐，因日本係徵兵制，所謂常備兵是新兵，雖然已經受多年的訓練，而且都是些十七八歲的青年，這些青年，心魂不定，旣無作戰經騐，亦無作戰決心，事實上很難參加作戰；但日本因制度的關係？所以明知此輩不能作戰，然亦無可如何地把他們的一部份送到中國來，㊁預備兵與後備兵沒有作戰能力：日本的預備兵與後備兵，都是些久荒營伍，甚至根本連演習也不舉行的老百姓，他們是店主，是夥計，是農民，是小學教師，是機開職員，一向過着社會安定生活，養尊處優，家裏有溫柔和好的父母兄弟，活潑可愛的妻兒子女，一旦要他們無緣無故拏着槍桿子越過遥遠的海洋來打中國，他們的家庭一定受到痛苦的，甚至生活也發生問題。他們明知戰爭是需要以生命兌境的，他們又如何舍得他們的良好家庭，以這樣對戰事生疏的老百姓來打人家，會收到多少效果呢？至於中國軍隊是募兵制的，中國兵是一種職業，他們入伍以後，一直過着兵營的生活，如果不遇到戰死或殘廢與衰老，他們是不會停止他們這種生活，他們都是常備的有經騐的戰士，並且沒有家庭的留戀，於是他們有着爽快勇敢的純軍人的性質和紀律，他們只知道衛護國家，服從命令，以此為其天職，除執行此項天職外，再也沒有更比戰爭更光榮的任務。現在日本軍隊佔領我們華北是事實，百十只敵艦和幾百架飛機用大砲炸彈轟擊滬京杭皖贛等地又是事實，數萬敵兵在閘北吳淞一帶造成侵略戰爭也是事實，這些事實都一一擺在我們的眼前，都深深地印進吾們兵士們的腦中，用不着長官向他們說明和解釋，他們自然會向敵人衝鋒，以必死的抉心殲滅敵人，以必死的決心護衛國家，當每一個人在執行他的天職時，他的奮勇和忠實是可想而知的。㊂偽滿軍不肯受他利用；在這次華北及淞滬作戰中，日本因軍隊的不敷支配，奴偽滿軍編入作戰，這是自殺的政策。東化同胞六年來所受的痛苦，無日不思報復，苦無機會，若加以宣傳和解釋，其反正便易如反掌，按此三項一比較，日本是用欺騙政策和強迫手段，把老百姓和偽軍拉過海洋打仗，坡們是以被侵略者，直接激發而向侵略者抵抗，他們是被騙迫而侵略人家的作戰，一個是自動，一個是被動。在兩方面作戰的任務旣不同，効果當然也兩樣，以這兩方軍隊所構成的戰爭，其勝負究屬伊誰，那是誰也都能判明的了。吾國有句老話：‘師哀者勝’中國怎會不勝呢？</p>
<p>根據這方面的觀察，充分表現日軍沒有長期戰爭的力量，而中國卻有抗戰到底的決心，這幾種都暴露出日本不能與中國長期戰爭的弱點，近衛首相在訪問西園寺公的歸途中，在箱根曾經說過：‘如果對華戰爭延長，將陷於中國的術策中，所以僅可能的將竭力避免長期戰爭，速取有效的解決辦法。這就很朋顯的表明日本是不能長期戰爭，假使中開能舉國一致，不屈服，不妥協，抗戰到底，那末，我們便可以徵實蔣委員長的說話，‘最後的勝利是屬於吾們了。’</p>
<p>最後我們要把握住下列三點：第一，要自信；第二，不希圖僥倖，第三，要不苟安遷就。</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Attempt to Cross the Zhoujia Bridge Failed; Fierce Battle Ensued for an Entire Day in the Zhenru and Jiangqiao Areas</h3>
<p>Our Covering Forces Have Safely Reached the Southern Bank of the Suzhou Creek; Enemy Forces Advanced Again in the Guangfu Area but Were Repelled by Our Forces; Our Air Force Sortied to Bombard Enemy Positions, Inflicting Heavy Damage; Eight Hundred Isolated Troops Still Hold Their Ground, Unwilling to Retreat</p>
<p>Our army's right-wing units, due to strategic considerations, were ordered to abandon key points such as Dachang, Jiangwan, and Zhabei and retreat to new positions, holding the opportunity to counterattack. As of yesterday evening, except for the Zhabei area, where more than a battalion of troops remained, vowing to defend the national territory and refusing to withdraw, all other units responsible for covering the retreat had reached their designated locations, and the deployment of new positions was also declared complete. The following is a record of the battles and situations on various fronts yesterday: ㊀ The isolated troops in Zhabei are still stationed in the Four Banks Warehouse, waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy. Although the enemy has devised various schemes and conspiracies, they have been unable to advance due to the solid defenses of our army and have never dared to move rashly. Yesterday, various sectors made many efforts to transport comfort items, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially made a national flag and transferred it to our army to hang on the roof of the seven-story building, in order to express the maintenance of the great national character of the Republic of China. ㊁ The covering forces of our army in the Pengpu Township and Zhenru Town areas broke through the enemy's encirclement yesterday and reached the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek. When our army retreated into the new positions in the Beixinjing area north of the Henan, the enemy thought that our army had not gained a firm foothold and took the opportunity to advance south, attempting to forcibly cross the river in the Zhoujia Bridge area. Our army saw through their trick and had made preparations early. When they arrived along the north bank, they were immediately met with a head-on blow from our army, killing a large number of them. The enemy immediately collapsed and retreated. Subsequently, the enemy gathered firepower and launched a fierce attack on our army on the south bank. At the same time, more than a dozen enemy planes flew to the skies over the Beixinjing area, bombing indiscriminately, with the aim of destroying our fortifications on the south bank and covering their infantry to cross the river again. However, our army calmly fought back and remained unmoved. The fierce battle lasted until night, and the enemy, unable to achieve their goals, gradually reduced their fighting. ㊂ The line from Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonxiang has been completely connected by our army, and the fortifications on this line are also extremely solid. Therefore, the enemy army continuously attacked our streets from yesterday morning to evening, but all were firmly blocked by our army. However, the attacks became more fierce after dusk, and fierce battles often broke out. As of 1:00 AM this morning, the fighting was still intense. ㊃ Guangfu Town is still being firmly defended by our army. Yesterday, the enemy army bombarded fiercely with artillery throughout the day, but the infantry never dared to move rashly. There was no change in Chengqiao Town. The Liuhe area was as peaceful as ever. ㊄ Our air force, about several teams, was ordered to sortie to assist in the battle. Starting at 8:00 PM last night, they went to various enemy positions to drop bombs and bombed them all night until dawn, when they completed their mission and returned safely. In addition, our Pudong artillery also fired twice to fight with the enemy ships on the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:00 AM on the 28th that on the line from Zhoujia Bridge to Beixinjing on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, the enemy was holding each other across the river. In the afternoon of this day, the battle gradually eased. The enemy is reorganizing their troops and building fortifications on the north bank. It is expected that there will be a lull of three to five days, but the battle is very fierce on the line from Jiangqiao to Xiaonxiang.</p>
<h3>The Isolated Troops in Zhenru Bravely Broke Through the Encirclement and Have Retreated to the Southern Bank of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Our Forces in Pengpu Have Also Safely Crossed the River</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that a part of our army near Zhenru was covering the retreat of the main force and was surrounded by enemy troops on the evening of the 26th. They gathered in the town to resist. The enemy launched repeated attacks, but all were repelled. The enemy then used aircraft to drop bombs and set fire to the surrounding area, but our army remained unmoved in the flames. Yesterday morning, the enemy launched fierce attacks from the northeast, and fierce battles broke out again. Our army held the determination to die, so they fought bravely and fired with fortifications, killing many enemies. After a bloody battle until the afternoon, our army also suffered considerable casualties, and enemy planes continued to drop bombs, turning the entire town into ruins. Therefore, they gradually withdrew from the town to the south, charging at the risk of death, and finally our army fought a bloody path to the Suzhou Creek. As of the report, all had retreated to the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:45 PM on the 28th that Pengpu Town is still being firmly defended by our army and has established contact with Tanziawan along the Suzhou Creek. Therefore, although surrounded by enemy troops, they still fought desperately and engaged in street battles with the enemy. From last night to this afternoon, landmines exploded in several places, and the enemy army suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that a part of our army surrounded in the Pengpu area charged south and broke through the encirclement this afternoon, safely crossing the Suzhou Creek and stationed there.</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 12:00 AM on the 28th that at 6:00 AM, two regiments of enemy troops, covered by 30 tanks, advanced towards Zhenru in three routes from Dachang Zhabei along the Jiaotong Road, Zhongshan Road, and the railway line, launching fierce attacks on the northeast side of the town. Our covering troops defended various key points, calmly fought back, and launched a charge once, killing more than 300 enemies. After dispersing the enemy, they retreated calmly and arrived safely in the Beixinjing area of the second line of defense at around 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Zhoujia Bridge Failed</h3>
<p>They Attempted to Cross the River There but Were Repelled by Our Forces; Enemy Planes and Artillery Fiercely Bombarded Beixinjing</p>
<p>After a lull in the fighting, our army moved southwest from the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas and retreated safely to the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek, following the predetermined plan and equipped as early as the previous day, and then moving south in order from the警戒line, which is adjacent to the western district of the concession, and abandoning Datong University. After the enemy's naval marines occupied the limbs, they attempted to cross the river in the Zhoujia Bridge area at dawn yesterday. After our army calmly fought back under the artillery fire and swept them with machine guns, the enemy was finally unable to succeed.</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that the enemy army on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek attempted to cross the river to attack the south at dawn, firing and harassing our Zhoujia Bridge area. Our army also calmly fought back, and there was a very dense exchange of fire for a time. Then the enemy saw that we were prepared, so they retreated. At the moment, our army is defending the south bank of the Suzhou Creek from the west side of the concession, occupying the Toyota Yarn Factory, Zhoujia Bridge, and the Bailinan Road area, and has established contact with Jiangqiao Town, with a very solid front line. The railway bridge and Zhongshan Bridge on the river have been completely destroyed by our army, and it is very difficult for the enemy army to fly over. At dawn yesterday, the sound of artillery fire in western Shanghai was very dense. The enemy army on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek bombarded our coast in the Beixinjing area and enemy planes dropped bombs indiscriminately, but our fortifications were not damaged at all.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Advance in the Guangfu Area Was Repelled by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Close Contact on the Line from Xiaonxiang to Jiangqiao Town; Solidified Positions</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 27th dispatch: There was also a fierce battle in the Guangfu Shixianggong Temple area on the morning of the 27th. However, the enemy's actions here were intended to contain our forces, so after we counterattacked, the enemy retreated immediately, and our army did not pursue them.</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency in Guangfu reported at noon on the 28th that the battle situation north of Guangfu was quiet from the evening of the 27th to the morning of the 28th. However, the enemy's large artillery and planes were still carrying out their acts of destruction, bombing our entire line of positions. The planes especially circled around and would not leave. Our army calmly dealt with them and maintained strict vigilance.</p>
<p>After a lull in the fighting, the enemy army gradually advanced southwest from Dachang Zhabei, attempting to attack our warning positions in Jiangqiao Town. Therefore, they bombarded fiercely with artillery from the night before, and there was also fierce artillery fire in the Xiaonxiang area. After dawn yesterday, enemy planes in groups bombed and bombed towns such as Nanxiang, and almost no civilian houses were intact. However, our army still calmly defended, and the troops in Xiaonxiang and Jiangqiao have established close contact, and the Chen line is solid. If the enemy comes to attack, it will be difficult for them to succeed.</p>
<h3>Eight Hundred Isolated Troops Are Safe and Sound; Our Brave Soldiers Raised the National Flag High</h3>
<p>The Food Warehouse Is as Strong as a Fortress; The Enemy's Attack Failed; Righteous People Made Efforts Yesterday to Supply Food</p>
<p>The eight hundred brave soldiers of the 88th Division Xie Regiment, who fought bravely and were willing to make a heroic sacrifice, were still led by Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu yesterday, and they defended the Four Banks Warehouse to the death. The entire army is safe and sound. Before yesterday evening, our loyal and brave soldiers raised the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth on the roof of the six-story building, overwhelming the surrounding Japanese flags, and promoting the righteousness and supreme glory of our great Chinese nation. The heroic and righteous actions of these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers have won the infinite admiration of people from all walks of life in Shanghai and abroad, and have aroused the most enthusiastic attention, and the development of the frontline battle has become a secondary concern.</p>
<p>Determined to Defend to the Death Before Retreating</p>
<p>The first thing the reporter should report to compatriots is that these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers of the entire regiment, although in a dangerous situation surrounded by smoke and enemy soldiers, are not only in high spirits and enthusiasm, but also in a very calm and leisurely state. Yesterday morning, the British army stationed there made another effort to advise our loyal and brave soldiers to disarm and retreat into the concession. Although our loyal and brave soldiers were extremely grateful for the British army's friendly intentions, they had decided to defend the precious last position to the death, to shed the last drop of hot blood and make the most glorious sacrifice, so they firmly refused again. Yesterday, they tried to send out many letters, asking for them to be mailed, because they were all wills.</p>
<p>Calm Attitude and Raising the National Flag High</p>
<p>At about 5:00 PM yesterday, the reporter went to the top of a high-rise building on the southern bank of the Suzhou Creek again to observe the movements on the other side. At this time, there were countless Chinese and foreigners on the roofs and windows of nearby buildings making the same observations. The Four Banks Food Warehouse and the adjacent Continental Bank Warehouse on the other side were clearly visible. On the roof of the six-story building, which is about 50 yards long, there is a machine gun stand, which is for dealing with attacking enemy planes. There are about 10 of our brave soldiers on the roof, sometimes inspecting in groups to detect the enemy's movements, sometimes gathering together to talk and laugh, and discuss something. Their attitude is calm and leisurely, without any haste or panic. As the sun was about to set in the west, our loyal and brave soldiers suddenly raised the national flag high on the roof, fluttering in the wind, making the surrounding Japanese flags pale in comparison. This scene was inspiring and tearful.</p>
<p>Righteous People Transport Food</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers issued a heroic appeal, asking for the supply of sugar, salt, and light cakes, so that there would be no shortage of food and they could defend to the death. Yesterday, citizens automatically transported various foods, and those who planned to go to supply them were constantly on the road, but because the enemy army was scattered everywhere, they could not pass, and they were all extremely frustrated. A German woman loaded a large number of calcium packages into a car and transported them, entrusting the British army to forward them, and said that she was willing to continuously supply all the food for these eight hundred brave soldiers, but the traffic was cut off and the effort failed. However, during this period of full-scale resistance, our rear-area people have formed a united front with the frontline soldiers, so in an environment of great difficulty, some righteous people finally achieved the goal of transporting food.</p>
<p>As Solid as a Fortress and Can Be Used for Firm Defense</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, several enemy planes flew to the sky and hovered. Our loyal and brave soldiers immediately fired machine guns to drive them away. At about 3:00 PM, a part of the enemy army went to attack again, but they only fired from a distance and did not dare to approach. Many of the floor slopes and windows were broken. Our loyal and brave soldiers valued firearms and ammunition more than life. Seeing no traces of the enemy army, they did not retaliate. The Four Banks Warehouse and the Continental Warehouse can be connected by tiles and are constructed of steel and concrete, as solid as a fortress and can be used for firm defense. The fire doors have been piled up with sandbags, and fortifications have been built at both ends, so it is not easy for the enemy army to rush in. It is said that the enemy army has set up a 3-inch caliber artillery position nearby, intending to bombard, but we are also fearless. The enemy army has also used arson, causing the surrounding houses to be reduced to ashes, but the Four Banks Warehouse still stands unmoved. Our loyal and brave soldiers want to ask the enemy army to pay the price in order to fulfill their ambition to sacrifice themselves for righteousness, and they will be rewarded.</p>
<h3>The People in the Rear Area Are Enthusiastically Concerned</h3>
<p>After the news of our brave soldiers defending to the death and refusing to retreat spread, Chinese and foreigners who went to the area of North Xizang Road yesterday to see the situation were constantly on the road all day long. However, the enemy army north of the river fired sporadic bullets from time to time, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere, and the danger was extremely great. The British army stationed there has closed the New Rubbish Bridge and placed barbed wire at the intersection of North Xizang Road and Xinzha Road to prevent traffic. However, those who stood and watched were densely packed and never dispersed, which shows the concern of the people in the rear area for our loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, considering that the troops gathered in the stack of the Zhabei Four Banks Savings Society are determined to fight to the death and coexist with the position, and their loyalty and bravery are commendable, took the risk to present a national flag of the Republic of China yesterday afternoon, which was sent by the 41st Girl Scout of this city, asking them to hang it on the roof to promote the spirit of the army's sacrifice for the country. At the same time, they sent letters to Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Duanfu, expressing their admiration. The Youth National Salvation Service Corps also sent letters of condolence, and various groups and institutions in this city sent condolences one after another, including the Citizens' United Association, Renhe Hospital, colleagues in the accounting department of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, Gongmao Salt Shop, residents of various households in Hongfu Lane, Renji Hospital, Xiehe Foreign Company, Daguan Garden Bathhouse, Wufeng Dye Factory, Mingxing Printing Department, colleagues in Sanyang, and Wang Dingzhen, Wu Meipei, Dai Zulin, and Lu Hejun, etc. In addition, there are colleagues from the China Commercial Bank, etc. Among the food, the most common are anti-enemy biscuits, fruits, edible salt, soy sauce, and canned food, etc. Foreigners in this port also sent bread, candy, and tap water yesterday, which shows that our loyal and brave soldiers, who are guarding alone and regard death as home, have won the infinite admiration of Chinese and foreigners and are enough to shine on the world and be immortal.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspapers Unanimously Praised the Spirit of Our Army's Resistance</h3>
<p>The Retreat of Our Shanghai Army Is Not a Victory for the Japanese Army; It Will Be Difficult for Japan to Obtain Pleasant Results in Future Continued Battles</p>
<p>The Times</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 28th dispatch, Reuters: The Times' editorial today commented on the latest scene in the Shanghai battle, saying that if the Japanese army wants to turn the partial and planned retreat of the Chinese army in Shanghai into a total collapse, it will probably feel exhausted. The Japanese army's greatest and only goal is to destroy the Chinese army and make it no longer have strong and effective combat power. If this goal cannot be achieved, the land will not be of much importance even if it is obtained. As far as we know at present, the Japanese army has not made much progress towards this goal. Even if the Japanese army has killed 200,000 Chinese soldiers, many of whom may be the elite troops led by Nanjing, even if the Shanghai battle will not be prolonged after this, it may not be the case. However, the ten weeks of bloody battles in Shanghai will one day prove that it has placed the foundation of an unprecedented military force in China. Chinese soldiers have now emerged from the mist of farcical stories. This is the first time in modern history. Although most Chinese soldiers are still insufficiently trained and poorly equipped, and still carry umbrellas with them because they are unable to provide raincoats, they have held a position that people believe cannot be held for a week for ten weeks. We will see here that the resistance of the Chinese army in Shanghai will have a spiritual impact throughout China, not only today but also in the future.</p>
<p>Daily Mail</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 28th dispatch, Reuters: The Daily Mail commented on the Shanghai battle, saying that Japan's victory this time can preserve its prestige, and China's brave resistance for more than 70 days can also be proud of. At this point, both sides can accept a truce without shame. Unfortunately, neither side seems to be willing to express their willingness to cease fire. We hope that before the arrival of the cold winter, foreign mediation can make both sides accept the scope. If the war does not stop, there will be a danger of the Soviet Union joining the war and spreading the war. We can rely on the mutual country conference to use the greatest efforts of true communication and mediation to make the peace achieved in the end.</p>
<p>News Chronicle</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 28th dispatch, Havas: Regarding the war between China and Japan, the News Chronicle, a Shanxi newspaper, recently added an editorial, still advocating boycotting Japanese goods. It said, "The Chinese army's enthusiastic resistance in Shanghai is really only seen in the history of any country. The British and American troops stationed in Shanghai can only watch the barbaric war waged by Japan, and it is true that they admire the heroic Chinese army very much. In the future, the Japanese army will continue to fight, and the further away from the country's warships, the more difficult it will be. Examining the various wars in the world, both sides involved have some justified reasons, but there is not a single word that can be forgiven for Japan in this conflict between China and Japan. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference should be opened immediately. At that time, the representatives of various countries should take a strong stand to maintain the rule of law in each country and lead the world to boycott Japanese goods in order to force the country to 'kneel' and not invade China. In short, civilized countries should do something to resist the act of aggression and maintain an ideal, at least as equal to what the ordinary soldiers in China are doing."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury</p>
<p>The editorial of the English Evening Post &amp; Mercury of this city on the evening of the 28th, entitled "Where Lies Victory", originally stated, "After 76 days of bloody resistance, the inevitable retreat of Zhabei by the Chinese army has finally been realized. People around the world are amazed at how long the Chinese army has held Zhabei. It is true that the Chinese army's indomitable tenacity and burning patriotism have undergone a glorious test. We have witnessed the heroic spirit of the Chinese army in Zhabei in 1937 and will always leave a deep impression in our minds. This is a victory for Japan but not a real victory. Since the beginning of the Shanghai war, this newspaper has pointed out that the Yangtze River coast is difficult to defend for a long time, because the invaders can use warships and artillery to bombard it, and it is difficult for even strongly defended troops to hold it firmly. During the Shanghai War in 1932, the Japanese army was able to detour and flank, causing the heroic 19th Route Army to withdraw to the interior. This time, the Chinese army's front line was longer and stronger than before, and the Japanese army's flanking was no longer possible, but the Chinese army's front line finally moved with the North Station as the axis. Even after a longer period of resistance, it still resulted in a retreat. The reason why the Chinese army finally withdrew from the North Station was not due to the direct attack by the Japanese army, but because the Japanese army broke into the northwest area, making the Chinese army at risk of being cut off. The Chinese army's bravery in combat is unprecedented and will be immortalized in history. The isolated army's defense of Zhabei is especially admired by the world. It will take several days to understand the battle routes of both sides, because this situation is very different from that in 1932. At that time, the war ended after the Chinese army retreated, but this time, the war zone has expanded and the war will inevitably be more intense. (Omission) Both sides have been fighting bloodily for two and a half months. Those who have suffered heavy damage are non-combatants. This is the harvest of the Japanese mad imperialists carrying out acts of aggression in China. Japan's attempt to seek friendship has resulted in the Chinese people's hatred and seeking commercial prosperity has cost millions of military expenses. The next two attacks will also have some pleasant results.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Dachang; Division Commander Zhu Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Dying to Thank the Country</p>
<p>A war correspondent from the Central News Agency reported at 8:20 PM on the 28th that Division Commander Zhu Yaohua led his troops to defend the position west of Dachang.

<h3>The Enemy's Casualties Since August 13 Have Reached More Than 70,000</h3>

<h3>Japanese Planes Flew Near the British Defense Zone; British Soldiers Fired in Fierce Attack</h3>
<p>The Critique of the North-China Daily News</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News of this city said that when a large Japanese bomber finally attacked the Chinese army position at the railway intersection near Great Western Road on the morning of the 27th, the British army defense zone on凱旋路 fired at the Japanese plane 140 times, but because the Japanese plane was flying very high, none of them hit. U.S. military authorities warned Japanese authorities on the 25th that if any Japanese planes endangered the British army defense zone in the future, the British army would immediately open fire. Furthermore, since the incident of a British soldier being killed by a Japanese plane on凯旋路, the British soldiers have installed a high-射炮架 there to place machine guns for high-射 firing. Also, after a Japanese plane dropped three bombs between the British soldier's Q defense zone at the corner of敦信路 and凯旋路 and the British soldier's defense zone on Great Western Road, the British soldiers' PQOM four defense zones simultaneously opened machine guns. One of the bombs dropped by the Japanese plane fell only 100 yards away from the British soldier's defense zone on Great Western Road, and another bomb was only a few feet away from other British soldier's defense zones. Fortunately, there was no one on duty at the defense zones on Great Western Road and悼信路 at the time, so no disaster occurred. It is said that a Japanese plane suddenly dived down near the British soldier's defense zone on the 27th, and the British soldiers defending Great Western Road immediately swept the Japanese plane with machine guns. Then the British officer on凯旋路 also ordered the British soldiers in the four defense zones to open fire at the Japanese plane. For a time, the sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. The British soldiers fired a total of 40 shots. At the same time, the Chinese army defense zone across from Great Western Road also swept the Japanese plane with machine guns and rifles. The Japanese plane then fled in panic. Also, a British officer told a reporter from the North-China Daily News that "Whenever a Japanese plane endangers the British soldier's defense zone, we will order the British soldiers to open fire. At that time, the Japanese plane was just starting to attack the Chinese army position, only a few hundred yards away from our defense zone, so I ordered the four defense zones to open fire. Fortunately, when the Japanese 南炸弹 fell near the British soldier's P defense zone, there was no one there to be hit, but the spot where the bomb fell was very close and was already unsettling." Also, according to Japanese sources, one Japanese seaplane was hit at 8:30 AM on the 27th in湾西 and crashed west of Zhongshan Road on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3>Report by the British Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons on the Incident's Course</h3>
<p>[London] During yesterday afternoon's session of the House of Commons, Sir O'Neill, a Conservative Member of Parliament, questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about the case of a British soldier killed by a Japanese aircraft near the Kaixuan Road in Shanghai. Eden immediately replied, "Following the incident, the Japanese government sent a note to the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, offering a formal apology and expressing willingness to punish those responsible and compensate for losses. The British government promptly instructed Ambassador Craigie to accept the apology and assurances, while also declaring that the British soldiers' retaliatory measures against the Japanese aircraft were entirely justified." (Members of Parliament greeted the statement with cheers.) "Should a similar incident occur in the future, it will be dealt with in the same manner." O'Neill further asked, "Will the Japanese government provide adequate compensation to the families of the deceased British soldiers?" Eden replied in the affirmative.

<h3>The Enemy Breaks Through Gu Yi in Eastern Shanxi, Our Troops Retreat to Yangquan from Niangziguan</h3>
<p>The Enemy in the Front of Xinkou Is Valiantly Repelled by Our Forces; Our Troops Advance North along the Pinghan Railway, Recapturing Xingtai; the Enemy Suffers Heavy Casualties near Yucheng on the Jinpu Railway</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The enemy in eastern Shanxi, failing in repeated attacks, concentrated their forces on the 26th and 27th against our right flank near Guyi (near Jiuguan), launching assaults under cover of heavy artillery and tanks. Our troops, having valiantly resisted the enemy for days, suffered many casualties. Although reinforcements arrived, they were subjected to fierce attacks before they could establish a firm foothold. Nevertheless, they bravely resisted, but were eventually overwhelmed by the enemy's heavy artillery fire, which destroyed most of the fortifications, leading to a breakthrough at one point. Taking advantage of this opening, the enemy infiltrated, and our troops, unable to defend the original position, had no choice but to retreat slightly. With Guyi having been breached, Niangziguan was now behind Guyi geographically, and a retreat was also inevitable. Our troops have now retreated and regrouped in the Yangquan area, setting up new defensive positions. With the battle lines shortened, our forces can be concentrated to continue the resistance.

The ensuing struggle was extremely fierce, with the positions changing hands several times. Ultimately, thanks to the valor of our officers and soldiers, the heights were retaken by our forces. The enemy stubbornly defending the left flank launched fierce attacks on Jiacun to our southwest from the afternoon of the 27th.

<h3>A Russian Employee of the Beiping Post Office Was Arrested; The Japanese Used Torture to Force Him to Confess</h3>
<p>Pressuring Him to Reveal the Location of the Postage Stamp Steel Plate</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a report by Li Qi (a foreigner), a senior official of the China Postal Administration, the Japanese authorities in Beiping are planning to issue postage stamps in various provinces of North China. As a result, a White Russian employee was arrested by the Beiping police and tortured to force him to reveal the location of the steel plate for printing the stamps. This person, named Tumayeff, was originally a Georgian prince and has worked for the China Post Office for 25 years. He was arrested on the 23rd of this month within the Legation Quarter in Jiaomin Lane, Beiping. According to Li Qi, Tumayeff has a very high character and will never hand over the steel plate, which is stored in a certain foreign bank, no matter what. Li Qi also said that the reason why the Japanese were able to order the Beiping police to arrest and torture Tumayeff was entirely because he was a White Russian and did not enjoy consular jurisdiction. Li Qi is currently in Nanjing, requesting the British and American embassies to intervene and seek justice so that the Japanese will release him as soon as possible. Li Qi then gave a moving account of the maintenance of postal communications between Shanghai and the capital during the recent war.

<p>Letter to the Citizens</p>
<p>Since August 13th, our national army, under the command of the highest authorities, has been fighting a bloody war to defend Greater Shanghai and the territorial sovereignty of the Republic of China. Two and a half months have passed. In these two and a half months, our front-line soldiers, with unprecedented bravery, fought against the enemy's elite mechanized forces of the army, navy, and air force, which has shocked and amazed the whole world, adding glory to our national history. Now, in order to shorten the battle lines and facilitate a protracted war, the national army has been moving and adjusting the lines on the eastern battlefield from the first line to the second line since October 26th. This is entirely due to strategic necessity. Although we have temporarily withdrawn from Jiangwan and Zhabei, the enemy has spent two and a half months and a huge amount of manpower and material resources, and as a result, they have only occupied a line of positions on the north bank of the Huangpu River that is less than 20 kilometers long. This has proved that our national army cannot be easily humiliated. We will never easily give up our territory. Our army has retreated to the second line, relying on more favorable terrain and pre-prepared defensive fortifications, deep trenches, and solid fortifications, and coordinating with the actions of the national army in North China to fight a protracted war to consume and destroy the aggressor's military power and strive for final victory. There is no doubt about this. In the process of this movement of positions, the enemy and traitors will inevitably spread rumors everywhere to confuse people and even advocate for peace negotiations. For this reason, various organizations in Shanghai are holding a joint meeting today to solemnly declare to the citizens of Greater Shanghai that resisting to the end and sacrificing to the end has become the established national policy of our government. We must support this national policy to the end. We will never allow the rumors and incitement of traitors or those who are born of defeat to shake the determination of the military and civilians on the front and rear to resist the war. The citizens of Greater Shanghai will not only not waver or slacken, but will also more resolutely and enthusiastically carry out the anti-enemy support work. We must sacrifice gloriously for the country and the nation like the soldiers fighting on the front line. We are determined to protect Greater Shanghai, because Greater Shanghai is the territory of the Republic of China and cannot be abandoned. Citizens of Greater Shanghai, get up quickly, support the government's national policy of resisting to the end, strengthen the unity between the government and the people, and between the people and the army. Everyone rise up, become the rear support for the soldiers on the front line, resolutely implement the economic boycott of Japan, severely punish traitors, help the army in its work, and demand that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference impose sanctions on Japan. These responsibilities fall on the shoulders of the citizens of Greater Shanghai. Citizens of Greater Shanghai, rise up, protect Greater Shanghai, protect the Republic of China, support the government, and resist to the end!</p>
<h3>Women's Circles in Shanghai Unite to Support Our Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Telegraphing the League of Nations to Request Upholding All International Conventions; Sympathizing with Wounded Soldiers and Refugees, Exerting Efforts to Donate Funds for Rescue and Care; Women's Groups Hosted Guests Yesterday</p>
<p>Various women's groups in this city, in order to request women of various countries to assert the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, specially hosted leading women of various countries in this city at the International Hotel on the second floor yesterday afternoon at four o'clock. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Attending</p>
<p>The women from various countries who attended included Ms. Smith, representative of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mrs. Marshall, President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mrs. Luson Pan, wife of the French Consul in Shanghai, Mrs. Sherman, wife of the Russian Consul, Mrs. Ansel, wife of the German Consul, Mrs. Wetner, Chairman of the British Women's Group, Mrs. Lunuo, representative of Hungary, Mrs. Anor, wife of the American Commercial Counselor, and Mrs. Merlot, etc., together with approximately 300 representatives from women's groups in this city, including Mrs. Kong, wife of Minister Kong, Mrs. Yu, wife of Mayor Yu, Tian Shujun, wife of Commander Yang, He Xiangning, Jin Guangmei, Qian Jianqiu, Zhu Su'e, Li Zemin, Wu Zao, etc.</p>
<p>Speech by the Chair</p>
<p>First, the Chair, Liu Wang Liming, explained the significance of hosting the leading women of various countries in Mandarin. Then, she delivered a speech in English, the gist of which was: ⑴ to report on the organization and work of the joint office, ⑵ to thank the friendly nations for their assistance, ⑶ to request women of various countries to assert the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, to advocate fairness and justice, and to safeguard world peace. Next, Mrs. Kong, Soong Ai-ling, delivered a speech in English.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kong's Speech</p>
<p>On behalf of the Chinese women in Shanghai, I sincerely extend my welcome to our foreign friends. At a time when your governments advised you to return home, you remained here and shared the dangers of the war with us. Our emotion is self-evident as we gather together this afternoon. Our friendship in ordinary times has united us women, and this hardship has strengthened our bond. We have all witnessed Japan's acts of aggression in Shanghai. In this city and its suburbs, which have always enjoyed peace, the Japanese army has slaughtered lives and destroyed property. Everyone shares our compatriots' outrage at this cruel and inhumane behavior. We are grateful for your participation in rescue work in various fields, which has reduced the suffering of innocent civilians who have been harmed by artillery fire without a declaration of war. The echo of the cannons has not yet ceased, and every tremor reminds us of the increasing death, destruction, and devastation. Since ancient times, women have been considered the comforters of humanity. For example, when a child falls, any mother unconsciously picks up the child and kisses the bruised knee or head. This deep comfort can alleviate pain better than anything else. Indeed, compassion is the balm and the only comfort for people's hearts. But today, women must go further to ensure world peace. We must strive to uphold international justice and social justice. Only if we women all over the world unite to work for international justice can we end the worsening environment we face today. This is not a fantasy, but a practical common sense. Women, I hope you believe this simple truth: if we want peace, we must work on the ground. We must seek international justice according to our beliefs, and we must recognize that the foundation of lasting peace is built only on true international justice. To you, China is like a second home. In addition to moral support, you have given our compatriots much practical help, and I must express my gratitude. Then, Miss He Xiangning's daughter, Liao Mengxing, delivered a speech on behalf of her mother.</p>
<p>Resolution on Support</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mrs. Ansel, representative of the German Women's Association, Mrs. Lunuo, representative of Hungary, Ms. Smith, representative of the American Chamber of Commerce, Mrs. Sherman, wife of the Russian Consul, Mrs. Wetner, Chairman of the British Women's Association, and others successively expressed their opinions. The gist of their remarks was: ⑴ to express their deep sympathy for the fighting spirit of the Chinese people during the national crisis, ⑵ to express their willingness to assist in the rescue work, ⑶ to encourage Chinese women not to despair, to use education over a long period of time to keep the cruelty of war away from humanity forever, ⑷ to sympathize and donate funds. Finally, the American representative proposed that, in addition to the women present jointly telegraphing Ms. Dingman, President of the Women's Peace Association of the League of Nations, requesting that the dignity and integrity of the Nine-Power Treaty and all other treaties be maintained, the women attending would also telegraph individually to uphold fairness and justice and to safeguard world peace. This was unanimously approved. At about 7 o'clock, the tea party adjourned.</p>

<h3>Tongji University Resumes Classes After Relocating to Jinhua</h3>
<p>(Jinhua Dispatch) National Tongji University has relocated to Jinhua and commenced the semester on the 20th of this month. All faculty and staff have arrived at the campus, and classes officially began on the 25th of this month. A memorial week for the Premier was held at 10:00 AM on the same day, attended by over six hundred faculty, staff and students. President Weng Zhilong, who had been receiving treatment in Hangzhou due to illness, made a special trip to Jinhua to attend despite his condition and gave a speech summarizing the university’s relocation process and plans for revival. He stated that after the Lugouqiao Incident, fearing the Japanese’s meticulous planning, the university managed to move important equipment to safe areas before the Battle of Shanghai could be avoided. At that time, in order to avoid causing social unrest, this could only be done secretly, and the difficulties involved were truly beyond the comprehension of others. After the “August 13th” Anti-Japanese War broke out, although a temporary campus site had been found, it was feared that this all-out war of resistance would not end in the short term, and Shanghai was the front line of the war. In order to maintain education continuously, it was necessary to choose a site for relocation. Moreover, more than two-thirds of the universities in the country were concentrated in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) and Shanghai, especially in Shanghai, which was a disproportionate development of education in our country that had long been criticized by those in the know. The authorities had long wanted to adjust this situation. Our university is a complete practical science university. After the "January 28th" Incident, I took over the presidency of the university and, learning from past mistakes, had a plan to move to the interior, but it had not been realized due to factual constraints. Therefore, the relocation of our university from Shanghai was the realization of a consistent plan. As for the new site of our university, the reason for choosing Jinhua was also after detailed consideration. The new site of our university must ⑴ be convenient for transportation, ⑵ have a suitable environment, and ⑶ be not easily threatened by the enemy. Jinhua has convenient land and water transportation, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway runs through the county. In military terms, it has no importance, and the enemy aircraft's threat is only to destroy transportation. The new site of our university is far from the railway line. In terms of safety, during the War of Resistance, enemy aircraft are rampant everywhere, except for remote provinces such as Sichuan. How can there be any guaranteed safety? How can we bear to put our personal safety above maintaining continuous education? Moreover, Jinhua has beautiful scenery with mountains and rivers, and a strong literary tradition. From the perspective of human and geographical geography, the environment is extremely suitable. Except for Hangzhou, there are no universities in the interior of Zhejiang Province. The relocation of our university to Jinhua is also extremely necessary for the adjustment of university education. This relocation was approved by the authorities and assisted by the Beijing-Shanghai and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureaus and the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Jinhua local administrative organs. The relocation was completed in four days without any loss, which is very difficult. Fortunately, all the faculty and staff have arrived at the campus, and the German professors have also telegraphed the school, and will come together in a few days. As for the university's current plans, ⑴ temporary school buildings will be built soon, with land purchased with donations from the faculty and staff; ⑵ after relocating to the interior, we will encourage the spirit of research among the faculty and students and foster a good and simple academic style to establish a new foundation for education. The frivolous and extravagant habits acquired in Shanghai must be eradicated and not allowed to remain, so that we can study and work hard in a practical way; ⑶ in order to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance, we will strive to supplement specialized technical personnel. The speech was very long, and the ceremony ended at about 12 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru and Six Others Will Go to Nanjing Together Within Days</h3>
<p>To Contribute Important Opinions; To Report on the General Situation of the Rear Area</p>
<p>Shen Junru, Wang Zao Shi, Sha Qianli, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, and four others, in view of the fact that the Shanghai war has entered a new stage and the situation of the War of Resistance is developing, in order to contribute important opinions for the government to adopt, have decided to depart together for Nanjing within the next few days to meet with the central authorities and make statements. At the same time, they will give a detailed report on the general situation of the resistance line in the rear area of Shanghai and the work done in the past.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Postcards Released</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Postcard Society at No. 80 Hualong Road in this city has released a new type of anti-Japanese postcard, with designs by famous painters and texts by famous writers. There are six types in total: ⑴ to send to generals and brave soldiers, ⑵ to give to wounded soldiers, ⑶ to solicit donations for national salvation bonds, ⑷ to write to relatives and friends, etc. During this period of the War of Resistance, it is extremely sufficient to inspire patriotic enthusiasm. It is said that each set of six cards sells for six cents, and sending a letter with sufficient return postage (three cents) will ensure delivery.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Model of Patriotic Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>When our army in Zhabei withdrew the day before yesterday, more than 800 loyal and brave soldiers led by Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu of the 88th Division were ordered to hold key points to cover the transfer of the main force. After the mission was completed, they could have calmly withdrawn with the main force, but everyone was determined to sacrifice for the country. They waited for the enemy to occupy Zhabei and continued to resist. Finally, they were trapped in the Sihang Warehouse and fought with the pursuing enemy, killing as many as sixty or seventy enemies with hand grenades and machine guns. The enemy army is still besieging them. According to the statement of these soldiers, although they are in a state of isolation and helplessness, they are determined to fight the enemy to the death for a week. This spirit of regarding death as home has not only been witnessed by many Chinese and foreigners in the concession, but also spread abroad. It is as sensational to the world as the story of the Spanish soldiers holding the Alcázar fortress to the death.</p>
<p>These eight hundred soldiers, displaying the virtues of fortitude, agility, and bravery, are the model of our countless patriotic soldiers. This makes everyone believe that the Chinese army will never be defeated by the enemy even in the most difficult circumstances. The recent abandonment of Zhabei is obviously far from being a defeat.</p>
<p>Let us allow the enemy to boast to the world that the Imperial Army has occupied such and such places. In the suburbs of Beiping, our thousands of advancing teams are still active, making the enemy feel a great threat. The eight hundred soldiers in the Sihang Warehouse are also containing a considerable number of enemy troops in Zhabei. In the past two days alone, they have made the enemy taste no small bitterness. We can assert that in any occupied territory, the enemy will not be able to sleep peacefully for a day.</p>

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference Invites Russia and Germany to Participate</h3>
<p>Japan's Refusal to Attend Does Not Impede the Conference's Progress; The United States' Attitude Is Not Expected to Change</p>
<p>⊙Brussels The Belgian government, having consulted with the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty who have agreed to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, has formally invited Germany and the Soviet Union to send representatives to participate. The letters of invitation have been sent out today. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels According to sources, the postponement of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will not delay the conference's progress. According to the original plan, the first meeting, scheduled for October 30, will be merely a formality to decide on sending invitations to Germany and the Soviet Union. Afterwards, the conference will adjourn for three days to await replies from Russia and Germany. It is expected that representatives from Germany and the Soviet Union will be able to attend the official opening of the conference on November 3. Japan's refusal to participate was expected and did not cause any real disappointment. According to general opinion, if Italy, Germany, and Russia do not defend Japan or hinder the proceedings, Japan's absence will allow the conference to proceed more quickly with its work. As for the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue, which was originally scheduled to meet on November 5, it has now been postponed indefinitely and will be convened after the completion of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>[Paris] After arriving here today, the head of the American delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Davis, immediately scheduled a meeting with the American Ambassador to France, Bullitt. It is believed that the two will discuss the Far East issue. (28th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>The US Still Holds Its Established Position</h3>
<p>[Washington] Although the State Department has not commented on Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, observers believe that the United States' attitude will not change and that it will continue to cooperate with other related countries. The United States will also oppose any delays in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in the future. As for Japan's refusal to participate in the conference, it is probably related to the victory of the Japanese army in Shanghai yesterday. In the past, whenever the country made military progress after invading northeastern China, it would become more assertive in its diplomatic attitude. This is consistent with the past. In addition, Secretary of State Hull also declined to express his opinion, saying only that the Japanese government's reply to the Belgian government had not yet been fully received here. (Central News Agency, Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's announced goal of using the Nine-Power Conference to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict, now that Japan has refused to participate in the conference, even if it is not impossible, is in an extremely difficult position. American isolationists originally did not approve of intervening in foreign affairs, but after hearing President Roosevelt's statement that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened for the purpose of reconciliation, they no longer insisted on their opposition. Now that the situation has changed, and the United States may be drawn into the vortex and adopt a threatening plan, isolationists may revive their high-sounding rhetoric of rejecting foreign affairs. This is also what the US President is worried about. In fact, the question of what steps to take other than mediation has not been considered. It is expected that a peaceful condemnation, such as recalling ambassadors, will be proposed in the future. However, judging from the phenomena, the government has not bound the US delegation's hands with prior consideration of this policy. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Eden Will Attend in Person</h3>
<p>[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that he would personally lead the delegation to attend. The other representatives are Overseas Dominion Minister Malcolm MacDonald and Foreign Office Assistant Sir Cadogan (former ambassador to China). (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Members of the British Parliament recently stated that the British government hopes that this conference will achieve success within the scope specified in Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on October 21. (Note: The Prime Minister's speech stated that Britain's participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was aimed at seeking peace, not expanding the war. The immediate task is to consider what joint action can be taken to achieve a peaceful solution.) In addition, the British government is eager to understand the US government's views and hopes that the United States will be able to launch some initiatives at the conference when the opportunity arises. Also, if Foreign Secretary Eden leaves Brussels, Malcolm MacDonald will serve as acting chief representative. This move of appointing MacDonald as a representative is highly valued by political figures, as all British dominions have representatives attending the conference, and MacDonald's participation in the conference as Minister of the Dominions will enable him to get along well with the representatives of the Dominions. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Researching a Replacement for the Washington Treaty</h3>
<p>[Paris] According to news from here today, as the opening date of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference approaches, major countries are now engaged in studying a way to completely replace the Washington Treaties. Since Japan seized the four northeastern provinces, the system of the Washington Treaties has been completely destroyed by Japan. Furthermore, even if the Sino-Japanese dispute is resolved, the international relations of East Asia will inevitably be placed on a new treaty basis. (28th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply Is Far-Fetched and Absurd</h3>
<p>Ignoring the Will of Others and Persisting in Its Own Way; Opposing Interference by the Powers</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today formally rejected the Belgian government's invitation to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The wording is far-fetched and absurd, and only a violent Japan could say such things. The gist is that this conference was initiated by the League of Nations, which has spiritually supported China, so it is inconvenient for Japan to participate. It also stated that Japan's actions in China were purely for self-defense and cannot be restricted by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Furthermore, the League of Nations has never had a good impression of Japan, so the North One Conference will not be able to conduct a fair discussion of Japan's position. Finally, the powers' intervention in Far Eastern affairs will only make the Far Eastern problem more difficult to solve. In short, its tone still regards itself as the master of East Asia. (27th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>Britain Expresses Regret</p>
<p>⊙London It is regrettable here that Japan has refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, as this move will make mediation more difficult. It is understood that other countries may be asked to mediate at that time and notify Tokyo of the conference's situation, and Germany would be the most suitable country to mediate. (28th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Criticize</p>
<p>⊙Paris Regarding Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, French newspapers of both the left and right have unanimously criticized it. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper stated, "The task of this conference is to work hard to mediate in order to end the war between China and Japan. If the Japanese government were to participate, wouldn't that be a wise move? It is a pity that the country's experienced and prudent politicians have been unable to do anything because of military interference. Japan's attack on China was originally an unjust act. If China were not short of the ordinary weapons needed for self-defense, then the tomb of the Japanese Empire would undoubtedly be dug in Chinese territory. According to a certain Japanese politician in a private letter, if China continues to resist, then the time when the war ends may also be the time when Japan establishes a republic, which is not necessarily impossible." The right-wing Le Petit Journal stated, "The Japanese military believes that refusing to participate in the conference has only advantages and no disadvantages. It can be seen that the country is winning militarily and is afraid that someone will stop it, so it persists in its own way. The self-indulgent Japanese imperialism will inevitably regret it." The right-wing Le Temps stated, "Although Japan has stated that it has no territorial ambitions for China, this statement has lost its effect due to the large scope of its military operations in China. Now that the country has refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it has confirmed the general public's concerns about Japan's ambitions. As for today's countermeasures, it is not appropriate to implement them, and all that can be hoped for is mediation." (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>The Content Has Not Been Leaked to the Outside; Still Trying to Accommodate Japan?</p>
<p>[London] The British Cabinet meeting today discussed the Far East situation for a long time. It met for two and a half hours in the morning and one and a half hours in the afternoon, discussing for a total of four hours, but the content has not been leaked to the outside. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] At the Cabinet meeting yesterday, the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was discussed. Observers believe that Britain will oppose any sanctions. Although the Japanese government has refused to participate in this conference, the related countries can still carry out constructive work, in other words, namely ⑴ if China and Japan sign an agreement to end the war in the future, the related countries can put pressure on Japan to reduce the demands it may make, ⑵ the related countries can exchange information on the protection of interests in China, and ⑶ the related countries can consult on methods of cooperation to ensure the safety of their territories adjacent to the war zone.

<h3>The Enemy Blockades Our Country's Coastline</h3>
<p>The Impact on Maritime Trade Is Minimal</p>
<p>[San Francisco] According to statistics released today by the Pacific Council, Japan's current blockade of the Chinese coast has had very little impact on China's maritime trade. For the past five years, Chinese ships have accounted for only 25 to 30 percent of all maritime transport, and have no bearing on the war, as the arms and equipment imported by China have always been transported by foreign ships. If calculated by the tonnage of seaborne goods, Britain ranked first last year, reaching 41 million tons, accounting for more than 41 percent. Now, Japan should not be allowed to obstruct Britain's trade with China. Japan ranks third, after Chinese ships, accounting for about 15 and a half percent. This number has increased by 5 percent compared to before the January 28th Incident. The United States has always had very little, only 1 percent. In short, since Japan cannot infringe on the freedom of other countries' ships, the so-called blockade is only a facade. (27th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>London Citizens Donate Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>The Total Amount Has Exceeded 30,000 Pounds</p>
<p>[London] Since the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Broadbridge, launched a fundraising campaign ten days ago to help the wounded soldiers and civilians in China, people from all walks of life have been very generous. The companies belonging to Lloyd's Insurance have recently collected the first batch of donations totaling five thousand pounds and sent them to the mayor. As of now, the total amount of donations has exceeded 20,000 pounds. (Central News Agency, Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] The wife of the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, recently launched a sale of Chinese art to raise funds to help the wounded soldiers and civilians in China.

<h3>New Zealand Federation of Labour Advocates Boycott of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>⊙Wellington According to a report from the President of the New Zealand Federation of Labour today, New Zealand Prime Minister Savage has now replied to the New Zealand Federation of Labour's petition, stating various reasons why Japanese shipping cannot be boycotted. The labor leader also said that the representatives of the New Zealand Federation of Labour had stated to the Cabinet that if the International Federation of Trade Unions decided to sever commercial relations with Japan, the New Zealand Federation of Labour should immediately order the workers of New Zealand to take the same action. At the same time, the New Zealand Federation of Labour has written to the International Federation of Trade Unions to inquire about the attitude of other countries towards this matter, and has made every effort to advocate a unified international boycott of Japanese goods.

<h3>San Francisco Crowds Demonstrate Against Japan</h3>
<p>[San Francisco] Today, a crowd of 600 people, including 200 Chinese, gathered at the wharf of the Japanese Postal Ship Company here to demonstrate for an hour and a half, shouting "Boycott Japanese goods" and "Don't forget the massacre in Shanghai." At that time, a Japanese postal ship happened to be at the shore, and two Japanese disseminators were surrounded by the crowd. Four porters also expressed their indignation at Japan's actions in China and went on strike for 15 minutes to show their protest. The crowd cheered and applauded. Afterwards, the crowd tried to break through the defense line set up by the police on the wharf, resulting in four white people and two Chinese being arrested by the police.

<h3>Japan's Invasion War Against China: A Crisis Looms</h3>
<p>Extreme Consumption of Resources, Declining International Status – No Spare Strength for Foreign Expansion Within Twenty Years – Observations of an American Military Expert</p>
<p>[Washington] Military and diplomatic experts here observed today that Japan's war in China, regardless of victory or defeat or withdrawal from Chinese territory, will render Japan incapable of coveting the Philippines for twenty years. In this war, Japan's financial and human resources will be extremely depleted, leaving it with no spare strength for further development elsewhere. Even if Japan were to achieve a pyrrhic victory in this war and control a vast territory in North China, the funds required to develop this vast land would plunge Japan into a state of exhaustion. Even with the strength to develop it, it would take a considerable number of years to reap any benefits. However, if victory in this war belongs to China, then Japan will not only "lose face greatly" and lose its status as a first-class power, but will also trigger a major revolution at home, plunging it into prolonged internal turmoil and leaving it with no spare strength for foreign expansion. Furthermore, Soviet Russia is eyeing Japan from the side, with the possibility of conflict at any time. Therefore, Japan cannot exhaust its strength in the war against China, lest it creates future troubles. Finally, the United States has not completely abandoned the Philippines, so Japan certainly would not dare to offend all parties at the same time, thereby increasing the danger to its position. Therefore, in the next twenty years, Japan will have no spare strength to covet the Philippines. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>If China Can Sustain Resistance</h3>
<p>It Will Inevitably Spur Revolution in Japan – Observations of a French Political Commentator</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, the labor newspaper published an article by Far East political commentator Madame Tabouis, stating that if China can continue to resist the brutal Japanese invasion for a long time, then "the one who will eventually end the war between the two countries may be a Japanese republic." Madame Tabouis further stated that she has received private letters from many major Japanese politicians indicating considerable support for this view.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Speech Again Advocates Peace Slogans</h3>
<p>Supports Germany's Colonial Demands, Expresses Continued Anti-Communist Warfare</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini addressed 100,000 people in Mussolini Square today, stating that the slogan for the sixteenth Fascist year, beginning today, is peace. Mussolini stated that the word "peace" has been misused by so-called democratic countries, but only when we use it does it have a profound and humane meaning, because we have gone to war and are preparing for major wars. Mussolini later stated that the result of the past fifteen years has been the revival of the Roman Empire, and it has not been aided by other countries. Mussolini also said, "The colonial clauses in the peace treaty must be revised, because a great people like Germany should have a corresponding position in the world." When Mussolini made this statement, he did not specify which colonial clauses he was referring to. After Mussolini finished speaking, he introduced Hitler's representative, Hess, to the crowd, who greeted him with enthusiastic cheers. Later, Mussolini mentioned his visit to Germany, saying that the friendship between Germany and Italy is now increasingly solid, and that communism must be driven out of Europe. (Central News Agency, Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Italian Prime Minister's speech today, political figures commented that Italy's desire to eliminate communism in Europe while maintaining peace is contradictory. It is difficult for the British to understand how Italy intends to eliminate communism without resorting to war. As for Mussolini's support for Germany's colonial demands, political figures believe that Britain is prepared to consider the restoration of German colonies, but only on the condition that German leader Hitler expresses his desire for peace.

<p>But Not to Be Seen as Withdrawing from the Committee</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently declared that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky had sent a letter to the Secretariat of the West Shanghai War Non-Intervention Committee, stating that the Soviet government, due to the failure to fully implement the monitoring measures for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, would refuse to pay its allocated expenses.

<h3>Scorched Earth Warfare and the Determination to Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhenduo</p>
<p>The northern sky is entirely filled with gray and dark black columns of smoke. Columns of smoke winding for several miles, with no gaps in between.</p>
<p>Zhabei, woven by Asuras! A hell on earth.</p>
<p>The roaring firelight shines through the smoke, dyeing the sky and earth red.</p>
<p>The incomparably brave soldiers are still fighting to the death, refusing to retreat!</p>
<p>In the red light, one can see half a crumbling wall, broken pillars with missing roofs.</p>
<p>Thick smoke rolls with red tongues of fire, and outside the thick smoke are pale red flames.</p>
<p>From morning to night, the winding flames burn, destroying everything.</p>
<p>Not a single lament can be heard, not a single tear can be seen.</p>
<p>Anger has scorched all the tears dry! There is nothing to miss, nothing to lament! Only a stronger heart to resist the enemy, a more disciplined will to resist the enemy!</p>
<p>The determination to sacrifice, the sacrifice of determination!</p>
<p>It turns out that we started the full-scale war of resistance with the determination to "resist to the end, sacrifice to the end."</p>
<p>The roaring firelight and the vigorous smoke symbolize the vigor and courage of the people of Shanghai in their determination to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>Zhabei is now surrounded and destroyed by flames! But Zhabei will never be destroyed! Like a phoenix, it will be reborn from the ashes; it will be reborn with more magnificent feathers and soar into the sky.</p>
<p>The destruction of Zhabei in "January 28th" only strengthened the will of the people of Shanghai to resist the enemy. Now, the flames of "October 27th" will further ignite their firm determination to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Never seek survival at the expense of integrity! Only jade shattered!</p>
<p>The soldiers at the front have endured concentrated bombing by more than a hundred enemy planes, and concentrated attacks by countless long-range naval and land artillery pieces, with almost no five-foot radius of soil left unturned. They have held on for more than seventy days. Their courage, their spirit of fearlessness, will forever be a symbol of the rebirth of the national soul, and will forever be an immortal feat that will startle heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods.</p>
<p>And the sacrifice of the people of Shanghai is like molten iron that matches it, and solidifies into the glory of our nation.</p>
<p>Never leave a single tile, a single small house that can shelter from the wind and rain, for the enemy to occupy!</p>
<p>Every step they take forward, the land they step on is scorched earth!</p>
<p>More than seventy days of hard fighting, the loss of more than 60,000 soldiers, the squandering of countless bombs and shells, and only a piece of scorched earth in Zhabei were exchanged. This will proclaim to them: What kind of firm determination and courage the Chinese nation has in its scorched earth resistance!</p>
<p>We may retreat step by step; but what we leave them is all scorched earth. This scorched earth is the bomb they swallow, the lead bullet shot into their chest.</p>
<p>Like a lion hunting a rabbit, when we turn around, we will see the enemy retreating in a panic! The bomb they swallowed will surely explode!</p>
<p>We, the army and the people, are united to defend our Shanghai! We will always hold on to the determination to fight a scorched earth war! Zhabei has become a piece of scorched earth and has been abandoned, but Shanghai must be defended! Defend it until it becomes a piece of scorched earth!</p>
<p>If they dare to take a step forward, that step must cost them 60,000 to 70,000 people, more than seventy to a hundred days of hard fighting, and the squandering of countless bombs and shells, and the land they step on is a piece of scorched earth!</p>
<p>What's more, blocking them is the famous "Eastern Maginot Line"!</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai have no sorrow, no tears, only more determined courage and will to welcome this inevitable scorched earth war!</p>
<p>Like a lion hunting a rabbit, when we turn around, we will see the enemy retreating in a panic!</p>
<h3>Inhuman Enemy Strafes Our Refugees</h3>
<p>50,000 Refugees Gather in West Shanghai, With No Food or Drink, Urgent Relief Needed</p>
<p>The number of refugees in the Western District who have fled into the Concession from Route Tenant de Villiers is less than in previous days. The Concession has dispatched ambulances to stop there. Those who have been injured by stray bullets and women and children are escorted by the vehicles. Those who are able to walk are briefly questioned by the stationed troops and then released. According to eyewitnesses, the enemy army opened machine guns and strafed the refugees several times when about 10,000 to 20,000 refugees from Zhabei attempted to enter Route Tenant de Villiers from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway bridge. Many women and children were killed. The railway bridge was littered with corpses, a horrific sight. The Public Concession authorities opened the iron gates several times, allowing the refugees to enter the Concession successively.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after our army moved west for strategic reasons and withdrew the garrison from Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Miaohang, the people along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek lost their reliance and fled south one after another. Since the blocking of Yujiazhai Bridge, traffic has been cut off invisibly, and the refugees are even more at a loss, especially the farmers in the Pengpu area. From the evening of the 27th to noon today, the number of refugees gathered on Zhongshan Road and near Xujiahui in West Shanghai has reached more than 50,000, who have been without food or drink for 20 hours and are in urgent need of relief. At the same time, the various reception centers set up by the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Branch are also full. It is hoped that all great philanthropists will quickly donate funds for relief. The association will welcome those who allocate funds to set up additional reception centers. Just report the location, the number of people to be accommodated, and the budget. The North China Daily News reported that a certain foreigner took a film camera to inspect the area around Jessfield Park yesterday morning. He told the representative of the North China Daily News that the scenes he saw in the morning were too many for his film to capture. At least 20 Japanese planes were in the sky at that time, diving and bombing Zhongshan Road on both sides of Jessfield Road from time to time. At one point, the planes were very close to the British barracks, and the surrounding residents, apparently panicked by the destruction of the Zhongshan Road bridge, fled into the Concession in groups from early morning. Several hundred people also advanced along Route Tenant de Villiers towards the British guard post near the railway. When he arrived there, he watched from a convenient location as Japanese planes began bombing the vehicles near the station and the various cotton mills. The Japanese planes were all silver-colored single-wing planes. He took many pictures. Then he was shocked because three planes actually opened machine guns and fired at the fleeing refugees. He saw the planes very clearly. One was a seaplane, like the ones carried by the Izumo, and the other 200 were small fighter planes. They dived repeatedly, and the refugees scattered and fled in panic. He estimated that at least 200 people were killed or injured. Probably there were many more elsewhere. Some were still lying there. He saw six ambulances, fully loaded with the wounded, leaving. Another large group of refugees, with varying degrees of injuries, poured into the Concession, or were helped to safety by others. The situation at that time was very chaotic. Not only were a large number of refugees trying to enter the Concession, but many were also trying to leave the Concession, heading towards the Chinese military lines. Those who wanted to enter the Concession were allowed to pass, but those who wanted to leave were stopped. This happened between 10:00 am and noon. Just after 3:00 pm yesterday, a team of British officers and foreign civilians was shot at by machine guns from the north of the Suzhou Creek near the Jessfield Railway Bridge, and the crowd fled. Several Chinese refugees in the north of the Suzhou Creek were also shot in the back by machine guns. Yesterday evening, dozens of people, looking like farmers, fled into the Concession from the Hongqiao area. Last night, the Salvation Army claimed that about 5,000 refugees from the Hongqiao area had fled into the Concession yesterday afternoon. They did not bring any food, and very few clothes. They all passed through the British defense line and were led by Chinese and foreign staff of the Salvation Army into Route Tenant de Villiers. According to Mr. Morris, a British officer of the association, the association will provide at least one hot meal before 6:30 pm, and prepare a large amount of rice to be sent to Route Tenant de Villiers to feed the refugees spending the night there. It is expected that they will be moved to refugee shelters today.</p>
<h3>Battlefield Rescue Team Relocates to the Interior</h3>
<p>The Concession is Not a True Rear Area, Orders Rescue Workers to Rescue With the Army</p>
<p>Yu Hongxun, the captain of the Chinese Battlefield Rescue Team, believes that because Dachang has fallen, the enemy army has occupied Zhabei, and the Concession is not a true rear area, it is very inconvenient to travel long distances for rescue work. Therefore, yesterday, he relocated the first and second brigades of the team to the interior to work, and assigned the team's rescue personnel to various divisions, brigades, and regiments to rescue with the army to facilitate the work.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Benefiting Wounded Soldiers Generously Donate Large Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Yu and Qian Each Donate 3,000, New Pharmaceutical Industry Donates 5,000</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent businessman in the city, is usually enthusiastic about social welfare, which is admired by both Chinese and foreigners. Since the Shanghai War, Mr. Yu has provided various assistance in the rescue of wounded soldiers and the relief of refugees, which has benefited many people. The Shanghai Rescue Committee specifically sent a letter to Mr. Yu the other day, inviting him to serve as the honorary chairman of the committee, so that his leadership could be obtained to strengthen the rescue force, and he has gladly agreed. Mr. Yu has decided to donate all of the more than 40,000 yuan given by all sectors during his 70th birthday last year, which was intended to be used as the preparatory fund for the Yu Qiaqing Hospital, to the Shanghai Rescue Committee to cover the expenses of rescuing wounded soldiers. In addition to donating 1,000 yuan himself, Mr. Yu also raised 1,000 yuan from the Sanbei Company, 500 yuan each from Madam Wang Pan and Xu Guisheng, totaling 3,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Shanghai Rescue Committee yesterday, designated for the bread expenses of the wounded soldier station. Qian Xinzhimin, the president of Fudan University, also generously donated 3,000 yuan yesterday and sent it to the committee for constitutional use. The generosity of Mr. Yu and Mr. Qian in benefiting wounded soldiers and their enthusiasm for national affairs can be used as an example.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rescue Committee sent a letter to the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Federation, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association yesterday, stating that it had previously requested various representative groups and institutions to actively donate 100,000 yuan for monthly expenses, and is now grateful to the associations for generously donating 5,000 yuan. In addition to entrusting Dr. Yu Songjun to issue a formal receipt, a brief letter is used to express gratitude. In addition, the new pharmaceutical industry in the city has raised 5,000 yuan to comfort the soldiers in North China, which has also been fully paid by various industries.</p>
<h3>Firefighting Work in the Flames of Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Fire Was Not Completely Extinguished Until Yesterday Morning, An Emergency Station Was Set Up in the Western District</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th), the firefighters of the Public Works Department were very busy. There were several fires north of the New Garbage Bridge and the boundary of the Concession. Firefighters rushed to protect and rescue them, and they have not been able to stop the fires until this morning (the 28th). The association has set up an emergency station in the Western District, and dispatched vehicles to be stationed there, so that vehicles can be dispatched as soon as they are called. Yesterday, there were 70 people injured by stray bullets, etc. The station dispatched vehicles to rescue them. Those with minor injuries were bandaged separately, and those with serious injuries were sent to Shi Hospital. There were fires in Tangshan Road, Weituoma Road, and Qiwupu Road in the Eastern District. Part of the China East Tobacco Company was destroyed, and several civilian houses were turned into rubble.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Unauthorized Increase in Rice Prices</h3>
<p>If Rice Stores Automatically Increase Prices, Report It to the Regulatory Committee for Severe Punishment</p>
<p>The Municipal Food Regulation Committee believes that the city's rice reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of the people, and the highest price of white japonica rice is still 13.6 yuan per dan, and the secondary price is reduced accordingly. However, it is reported that some rice stores only care about private interests. On the day that our army voluntarily withdrew from the Zhabei Jiangwan Miaohang defense line, the rice price was increased to more than 14 yuan per dan without authorization. This kind of behavior is not only disturbing the market price, but its intention is no different from being a traitor. In addition to formally announcing that it is strictly forbidden for rice sellers not to comply with the prescribed market price, if citizens encounter rice stores automatically increasing prices, they can immediately report it to the Pudong Fellow Association Office of the Committee on Foch Road, and they can request the competent authority to severely punish them, in order to warn others against following their example.</p>
<h3>Chonghai and Cixi Fellow Associations Send Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Chonghai Special Ship Sets Sail Tomorrow Morning, Cixi Fellow Townspeople Register Immediately</p>
<p>Yu Jingyu, director of the Joint Office of the Haimen Disaster Relief and Haiqi Victim Relief People's Support Association, at the request of fellow villagers, continued to hire sailing ships to sail directly to Chongming Haimen. The first batch of ships that set off on the 25th have returned to Shanghai. The office has now decided to gather at the Tonghai Inn at Guanhai Bridge, Limalu, Nanshi tomorrow morning and set sail. Those who want to return can quickly register.</p>
<p>Due to the recent inconvenience in transportation, many Cixi fellow villagers living in Shanghai have requested the Cixi Shanghai Fellow Association to send them back to their hometowns. Now, the association has found a way to hire a large car for the purpose of rescuing poor fellow villagers, and will make the last trip from Shanghai to Hangzhou. Fellow villagers who want to transfer back to their hometowns can register at the association's temporary office at 125, 2nd Floor, Dafeng Building, 349 Ningbo Road, starting today.

<h3>Unemployed Workers Relief Association Examines Technical Workers</h3>
<p>Two Shelters Established, Introduce Corresponding Work</p>
<p>The Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, after registering unemployed male workers by district, in addition to issuing subsidies to qualified unemployed workers in batches of one dime per person per day, has also established two shelters dedicated to unemployed workers, divided into technical and ordinary types. Experts have been invited to examine the qualifications of technical workers starting yesterday, in order to introduce corresponding work.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Officials Staying in Shanghai Receive Living Expenses</h3>
<p>No Later Than the 15th of the Following Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Affiliated Bureaus announced to the officials staying in Shanghai that they will receive living expenses, according to the special order No. 1787 of the Municipal Government, which is about the method of tightening the payment of salaries to public officials in various bureaus of the government. Officials staying in Shanghai waiting for dispatch will receive 30 yuan for those with a monthly salary of more than 51 yuan, and 15 yuan for those with a monthly salary of 50 yuan or less, starting from October. The officers must report that they are willing to stay in Shanghai waiting for dispatch, and they can personally come to the bureau to collect their living expenses at the end of each month.

<h3>Christian Federation Continues 10,000 Vest Movement</h3>
<p>The cotton vests previously made by the Shanghai Christian Federation have all been distributed to the soldiers on the front line, which is very popular. However, it is felt that there are too many people and too few clothes, and there is an urgent need for another 10,000 pieces. According to the reporter's observation, the fabric used this time is strong and durable, and the cotton used inside is the best quality white cotton, in order to be practical. The cost of materials and labor for each piece is 6 dimes and 5 cents in silver. The association is willing to serve others with this quality of goods. If donations are made by all sectors, the association can be entrusted to handle the purchasing of materials, tailoring, or purchasing materials, regardless of the amount. The association will do its best to provide services. Contact points: Miss Wei and Miss Ji, Room 210, Second Floor, Southern Part of Moore Memorial Church, Yu Qiaqing Road.</p>
<h3>Newly Revised Registration Rules for Publishing Publications, Holding Meetings, and Forming Associations</h3>

<h3>Medical Community Cables Jiao Chen and Others, Requesting the Establishment of a Rescue Hospital</h3>
<p>Since a National Hospital Cannot Be Built, It is Better to Run a Wounded Soldiers' Hospital</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Medical Community Save-the-Nation Association recently telegraphed the Nanjing Central National Medical Museum, suggesting the organization of a wounded soldiers' hospital. The text reads, "Director Jiao Yitang and Chairman Chen Li of the Central National Medical Museum: Since the brutal Japanese have invaded us, the survival of the nation depends on one. All Chinese should rise up and jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation and ensuring its survival. Our Chinese medical community has always been committed to maintaining the happiness of the people, and it is our inescapable duty to save them from danger. Since its establishment, the association has been engaged in various save-the-nation activities, and has never slackened. The most urgent thing to do at present is to establish a rescue hospital, which is sufficient to fulfill the duties of our community. The association will do its best to promote the financial and physical support of colleagues in the Shanghai medical community. However, this matter is of great importance and requires huge expenses, which cannot be achieved immediately. We intend to request the Museum to allocate the more than 100,000 yuan of funds raised for the National Hospital to the needs of the rescue hospital. Since the National Hospital cannot be built at present, it is better to run a rescue hospital to treat wounded soldiers and disaster victims, which is of great significance to saving the country and saving the people. We sincerely hope that you will adopt and handle it. At the same time, Xu Kaisheng, Xinru, and Jin Jian of the medical community will also make the same suggestions to Chen Jiao and others in their personal capacity."</p>

<h3>Ten Days of Bloody Battles at Chenjiahang (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>That day, the enemy had already recognized the might of our artillery. To survive, they launched a sneak attack on our Dunwu Temple position with five or six hundred soldiers at dusk. Our Commander × directed from the rear, turning the tables on them. He deliberately left a corner of the position open, allowing them to break in. When he personally saw more than a hundred of them advancing hesitantly, Commander × immediately ordered Li Battalion from the reserve force to encircle them. The enemy realized that we were planning to annihilate them, but by then, they were almost completely wiped out by our gunfire from all directions. In the end, only a dozen or so escaped. A large pile of Rising Sun flags and their murder weapons were left behind. The most regrettable part of this battle was that after about half of the enemy had entered the position, our loyal and valiant Battalion Commander Cai, personally leading a company, went to cut off the enemy's retreat. He engaged the enemy officers in close combat with pistols and broadswords, and unfortunately died in battle. Our commander-in-chief has lost another capable general. The division commander, brigade commander, and regimental commander were all deeply saddened. However, he brought glory to the entire nation, and we are honored for him.</p>
<p>Because the enemy suffered setbacks attacking Dunwu Temple and Qiaotingzhai, they shifted their focus to Chenjiahang. Except for a brief crisis at Dunwu Temple on the 12th, from the 13th to the 16th, the enemy launched four or five attacks daily on Chenjiahang, using smoke screens and artillery cover, with a large force. Because Chenjiahang was a key point in our army's defense, we had previously deployed sufficient troops here. The generals defending Chenjiahang were Vice Brigade Commander × and Commanders ×× of two regiments. These three generals were all experienced in combat and had repeatedly earned merits in previous battles. Therefore, although the enemy launched fierce attacks with great force, we were absolutely confident in holding the position. Every time the enemy's attack became urgent, these three generals personally led machine guns to block the enemy in critical areas. Their bravery in battle and their skillful command were admired even by the enemy. At noon on the 15th, the enemy broke through the northeastern corner of the Chenjiahang position. We didn't pay attention to it at the time. When the enemy was sleeping soundly at midnight, our division commander mobilized a dozen mortars and selected the most elite battalion for a counterattack. This battalion commander, surnamed Zhang, was also from Shandong and was extremely brave in battle. After our dozen mortars fired more than two hundred shells together, the infantry, led by Battalion Commander Zhang, charged forward. Most of the two hundred enemies occupying the small bamboo garden were killed by the shells, and the rest died under our bayonets and hand grenades. The enemy counterattacked again that night, but we repelled them again.</p>
<p>On the 16th, there was another full day of bloody battle. At noon, the enemy gathered more than a hundred heavy artillery pieces, first using smoke screens to obscure our vision, and then the artillery fired in unison. The position defended by Battalion Commander Zhang was destroyed by the enemy's artillery, followed by a large-scale attack on us. Battalion Commander Zhang led his troops to resist desperately, killing more than a hundred enemies. The enemy, under the pressure of our infantry and artillery fire, retreated in disorder. Battalion Commander Zhang, seeing an opportunity, immediately left the trenches to pursue, but was shot in a vital spot by the enemy and seriously wounded. He was taken to the hospital in the evening and unfortunately died due to his injuries.</p>
<p>After spending seven days, using up tens of thousands of shells, and losing more than five thousand men, the enemy failed to break through our position. On the night of the 16th, they used poison gas against our troops. Dozens of soldiers defending the northeast positions of Chenjiahang were poisoned. After we discovered it, we immediately used first aid to save them. Only a few died. The enemy's inhumanity should be condemned by the whole world. On this day, when the battle was most critical, our division commander personally went to the front line to direct and supervise the battle. He was prepared to coexist with the Chenjiahang position and the loyal officers and soldiers. This was spread throughout the entire battle line, and the officers and soldiers were all inspired.</p>
<p>On the 17th, we handed over the defense to friendly forces. The position was the same when we handed it over as when we took it over. In total, we killed more than three thousand enemies and captured many weapons. What was most satisfying was that, when the change of guard was about to take place, a brother from Regiment × saw three enemy soldiers carrying a light machine gun towards our position. This brother went around from the side and threw two hand grenades when the enemy was close. All three enemy soldiers were killed, and he carried the enemy's machine gun back by himself. He has been promoted to sergeant, and the division commander rewarded him with forty yuan. Such a soldier with both intelligence and courage is truly rare.</p>
<p>Also, on the morning of the 12th, a small squad of our soldiers risked their lives to charge into the enemy's position, where there were two enemy anti-aircraft machine guns, aiming at our planes. Our soldiers bravely stepped forward and threw hand grenades. As the sparks flew, enemy corpses lay scattered, and two anti-aircraft machine guns were in our hands. Unfortunately, those two guns were too heavy for us to move. Later, we gathered hand grenades and blew up the two guns.</p>
<p>As we were talking, several soldiers came to pick him up on a stretcher. So I urged him to get on the stretcher and go back to the rear for treatment, and wished him a speedy recovery. He told me that he was very willing to regain his health immediately and return to the front line to kill enemies. After we parted, I took a ride on a certain army's truck back to Shanghai. As I was writing this manuscript, the image of this wounded young officer still lingered in my mind.</p>
<h3>International Red Cross Finance Department Allocates One Million</h3>
<p>Fundraising Overseas and Performing Plays for Donations; Subsidizing Various Charities to Aid Wounded Soldiers and Refugees</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross, organized by consuls from various countries and Chinese and foreign philanthropists, is dedicated to raising donations and rescuing wounded soldiers and refugees. After submitting a request to Finance Minister Kong for government funding, he agreed to allocate 800,000 yuan in national salvation bonds and 200,000 yuan in cash, totaling one million yuan. Donations from groups and individuals include 40,000 yuan from the American Chinese Disaster Relief Association, 15,000 yuan from the American Red Cross, 10,000 yuan from the Chinese Red Cross, 1,000 yuan from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, 1,000 yuan from Ambassador Yan Huijing, 1,000 yuan from Yuan Heng &amp; Co., 100 yuan from Xin Ji Jun, 83 yuan and 12 cents from H. Boyack, 60 yuan from Ms. Xie Jingquan, and 2 yuan from Tian Baile. Including the allocation from the Finance Department, the total is 1,068,145 yuan and 13 cents. Ms. Xie is particularly commendable. As a primary school teacher, her monthly salary is only 30 yuan. Now, she has donated all of her earnings from two months of hard work. Her enthusiasm for relief is truly worthy of emulation. According to the person in charge of the committee, they plan to raise 10 million yuan in national currency to subsidize various charities to aid wounded soldiers and refugees in the next six months. In addition to raising funds domestically, they have telegraphed friendly countries and overseas Chinese charities, requesting assistance. Chairman Yan Huijing, Director of Fundraising and Publicity Ambassador Shi Zhaoji, and Secretary-General Dr. Baker have telegraphed Ambassador Wang Zhengting in the United States, informing American charitable organizations and overseas Chinese groups to remit donations to the committee for centralized distribution and adjustment of relief funds in various regions. Similar telegrams have also been sent to the embassies in Britain, France, and other countries. It is also reported that they plan to invite famous actors to perform plays to raise funds. Dr. Mei Lanfang has agreed. Once the preparations are complete, the program will be announced and performances will be scheduled.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Released to the Treasury: 50 Million Yuan</h3>

<p>It has been learned that the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee has successively received bond payments remitted from various regions and has already accumulated 50 million yuan, which was released to the national treasury yesterday.</p>
<p>Donating One Month's Rent to Purchase National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association previously resolved to purchase National Salvation Bonds with one month's rent. It is now heard that the Eighth Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation and various anti-Japanese support associations have also made similar suggestions to the National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Headquarters. The headquarters yesterday replied to the Anti-Japanese Support Association, approving the plan. The original letter is excerpted below: "We have received the research report on the draft plan for using rent to purchase National Salvation Bonds, which your association submitted. Please check, accept, and review it, and reply accordingly. Since this case has already been resolved by the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association to purchase National Salvation Bonds with one month's rent, we tentatively approve the trial implementation according to the association's original resolution. We hope that all landlords and tenants in the city will implement it unanimously, expressing their enthusiastic support and taking responsibility without hesitation. The headquarters has high expectations. The above is the reason for the approval letter, and we hereby reply, hoping that you will check and comply accordingly, etc." It is hoped that all landlords and tenants in the city will act according to their patriotic conscience and jointly participate in this effort, implementing it unanimously.</p>
<p>Training Department Releases More Than 70,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bonds Fundraising Committee Headquarters recently received a letter from the General Training Department, stating that the department has decided that all staff members will donate one month's salary to purchase National Salvation Bonds, totaling 75,000 yuan, which has been successively paid into the bank and transferred to the Fundraising Headquarters.</p>

It is reported that the wives of Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, and Yu Hongjun will attend to report.</p>
<h3>Tea Exports Increase Rather Than Decrease</h3>
<p>China's Production Increases; Great Demand in Britain</p>
<p>Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, import and export trade has been affected to some extent. However, the export of China's native products has not been hindered. Taking tea as an example, the tea produced in Fujian, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces in China has continued to increase rather than decrease. It is reported that this year's tea production, under the overall planning of the China Tea Company, will not decrease. Britain, with weakened production in Ceylon, is seeking more tea from China.</p>
<h3>Chinese Red Cross Continues to Recruit Hospital Nurses</h3>

<p>Another Atrocity by Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Mr. Ni Chengkang, a member of the Fourth Relief Team of the Shanghai Relief Committee, was ordered on the 16th of this month to accompany other team members to escort wounded soldiers to Hangzhou from Shanghai. When the vehicle arrived at a certain place, it was discovered by enemy aircraft and bombed.

The committee immediately telegraphed the Anti-Japanese Support Association in a certain place to investigate Mr. Ni's whereabouts. Yesterday, a reply telegram stated that Mr. Ni had died in the line of duty and his body was fortunately found. The association will send personnel to handle the matter and allocate 150 yuan for funeral expenses and 500 yuan for bereavement compensation according to regulations.

<h3>Tragic Condition of Deceased Relief Worker Ni Chengkang</h3>
<h3>Fire in Jinliyuan Wharf No. 4 Warehouse Due to Carelessness</h3>
<p>Lack of Water for Firefighting Causes Devastation; Most Goods in the Warehouse Burned</p>
<p>At Jinliyuan Wharf No. 4, Sixteen Pupu, Nanshi, the lower floor is the customs inspection room of the Jianghai Customs, and the upper floor is rented to British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson Shipping Companies as a storage area for cargo shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the Nanhua liner. Recently, Taikoo's Chengdu and Jardine Matheson's Zesheng ships had just arrived from Hong Kong with a large batch of cargo, which was unloaded at the warehouse. At 6:40 p.m. yesterday, a wharf patrolman first discovered smoke coming from the windows of Warehouse No. 4 and immediately reported to warehouse manager Li Yunsheng, who urgently telegraphed the Fire Brigade to send fire trucks to the scene. At 7:00 p.m., the fire broke out in the warehouse. After the fire trucks arrived, the firefighting was greatly hampered due to the lack of tap water, and it was impossible to extinguish the fire. It was not until 7:50 p.m. that water arrived. Firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire, and by 8:30 p.m., the raging fire was gradually extinguished. The upper floor of Warehouse No. 4, which stored goods from Hong Kong, mainly cigarettes and foreign paper, was mostly burned. Fortunately, the adjacent Warehouse No. 5 was preserved with great effort and was not affected. As for the cause of the fire, according to warehouse manager Li Yunsheng, the lower floor of the Jianghai Customs inspection room had a large batch of goods waiting to be inspected, including sulfuric acid and camphor powder, all of which are easily flammable. Yesterday's weather was also hot and humid. The fire was likely caused by careless placement, so the fire broke out in the inspection room, and the upper floor of Warehouse No. 4 was unfortunately affected, resulting in a complete fire. The total amount of goods burned will have to be determined by Taikoo and Jardine Matheson.</p>

<h3>The Bloody Battle of Jiangqiao Town Continues; Enemy and Us Confront Each Other Across the River at Zhoujia Bridge</h3>
<p>Our Heavy Artillery Unit in Pudong Bombs Enemy Positions with Success; More Than a Dozen Enemy Aircraft Ravage Pudong This Afternoon; Our Loyal and Brave孤軍 in Zhabei Still Stand Firm</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter met with a certain military authority this morning, who stated that our army's new positions have been actively arranged for days, the fortifications are strong, and the strength is strong. If the enemy continues to attack, they will be met with a head-on blow. As for a small part of the enemy reaching the north bank of the Suzhou River, the troops are now rushing to build defensive fortifications, and the two armies are shooting across the river at Zhoujia Bridge. The enemy has not dared to lightly attempt a偷渡. According to military news, (1) the enemy shelled Beixinjing and Huacao Town overnight, but our army suffered no damage. (2) The fierce battle in Jiangqiao Town continued until noon today and has not stopped. Our army is guarding along the Qiujiang, and the enemy has not succeeded in the end. (3) The enemy's heavy troops attacked our Xiaonanxiang position from multiple routes and were all repelled. Xiaonanxiang is still in our hands, and close contact has been established with the Jiangqiao area. (4) There was a fierce battle near Shixianggong Temple, and the front line in Guangfu Town has not changed. (5) Our troops withdrawing from Zhenru Town have all safely arrived on the north bank of the Suzhou River, and are mutually supporting our troops on the south bank. As for our 800 loyal and brave soldiers who are guarding the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, they are still standing in the enemy's陣中 today and are fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. On the roof of the warehouse building, the national flag with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth flutters high in the air, showing the glory of our national army. The people on the north bank of the Suzhou River, numbering in the thousands, pay tribute to our loyal and brave soldiers, and the flow of慰劳品 has not stopped. The enemy is having difficulty attacking and is wandering around the high-rise buildings, seemingly at a loss. It is rumored that the enemy is erecting three-inch-caliber guns to bombard the warehouse, that enemy aircraft will drop heavy bombs, and that the enemy plans to bury landmines to blow up the building. However, due to various considerations by the enemy, these plans will absolutely not be realized.</p>
<h3>Intense Battle at Zhoujia Bridge Across the River</h3>
<p>Our Troops Firmly Hold the Henan Positions, Enemy Attempts to Cross the River Are Bound to Fail</p>
<p>From last night, in the Zhoujia Bridge area west of Avenue Bai Li Nan, the two armies have been engaged in a fierce battle across the river, exchanging machine gun and artillery fire. The battle is still ongoing this morning. When our reporter inspected the British defense area along Avenue Bai Li Nan and Avenue de President Doumer in western Shanghai this morning, the sound of machine guns from Zhoujia Bridge was as dense as a string of pearls, and the artillery fire was continuous, with one shot every ten or so seconds. Three or four enemy planes circled the area above, and when they flew over the British defense area on Avenue de President Doumer, the British immediately responded with anti-aircraft machine guns, firing three or four times, about thirty or forty rounds each time. The enemy planes flew very high and were not damaged. They did not dare to linger and left in an instant. The enemy's ambition to cross the river in the Zhoujia Bridge area has not diminished at all. Last night, when the moonlight was dim, they transported a large amount of timber, which was all destroyed by our air force that was dispatched last night. The Zhongshan Road Bridge and the south end of the Avenue de President Doumer iron bridge are heavily guarded by our troops, and the enemy is bound to fail in their attempts to cross the river.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 1:15 PM on the 29th that fighting had begun in the Avenue de President Doumer area. The enemy launched an attack from Datong University at 7:00 PM last night, advancing towards Zhoujia Bridge. Both sides exchanged artillery fire first. At 11:00 PM, about four or five hundred enemy soldiers attempted to cross the river in the Zhongshan Road intersection area. Our troops responded with machine gun fire, the bullets as dense as rain, leaving the enemy with no chance to succeed. They quietly retreated. The enemy in the Zhenru area also advanced southward along the Zhenbei Road, holding positions at Panzhai, Jijiaku, Qijiacun, and other places on the north bank, engaging in a standoff with our troops. Our troops also formed a battle line on the north bank, with their backs to the river, holding Huangjiazhai (west of Zhenbei Road), Majiazhai, Xiazhai, and Quanjiazhai (east of Zhenbei Road), constructing solid defenses. At 4:00 AM this morning, the enemy attacked with two regiments, but they were routed by our three counterattacks, with over a hundred enemy soldiers killed. After the enemy retreated, they remained in confrontation with us, the two sides separated by less than a thousand meters.</p>
<h3>Enemy Fiercely Attacks Jiangqiao, Repelled</h3>
<p>Our Troops in Zhenru Safely Retreat to the North Bank of the Suzhou River, Now Firmly Defending Along the Qiujiang River, Confronting the Enemy</p>
<p>Last night and this morning, the focus of the fighting remained on the line from Zhoujia Bridge to Beixinjing and Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang in western Shanghai, with the fighting in Jiangqiao Town being the most intense. From last night, enemy artillery fire was concentrated on the town, relentlessly bombarding it, attempting to break through this point and threaten our troops on the north bank of the Suzhou River north of Beixinjing. The bombardment continued this morning, and enemy planes also hovered and reconnoitered over our troop positions in the area. Our soldiers calmly responded to the battle. When the enemy advanced under the cover of artillery fire last night, our troops rushed forward fiercely, killing countless enemies. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and eventually retreated. Our Jiangqiao position remains extremely solid. The entire town of Jiangqiao has been bombarded by enemy artillery fire and bombs, turning it into a field of rubble.</p>
<p>Our troops in Zhenru and Pengpu broke through last night and have now safely retreated to the north bank of the Suzhou River, confronting the enemy along the Qiujiang River from Jiangqiao to Beixinjing and Zhoujia Bridge.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Xiaonanxiang Last Night</h3>
<p>Enemy Fiercely Attacks Our Flank Positions, Briefly Breaching Them Before Being Repelled</p>
<p>Northwest of Jiangqiao Town, across the railway line to Xiaonanxiang, the fighting on this line was unusually fierce last night. The enemy continued to fiercely attack this point, attempting to reconnoiter Nanshiang. Last night, the enemy repeatedly attacked our forward positions in Xiaonanxiang, but they were all repulsed by our troops. They then changed their strategy of frontal attack, attacking the rear of Xiaonanxiang, breaking through at Sijiaqiao in the northwest. Our troops fought bravely, but they were able to advance to Tangqiaojiao and Lujiazhai, threatening the rear of our Xiaonanxiang position. Our reinforcements arrived from the rear and charged forward fiercely. Under enemy artillery fire, they finally routed the attacking enemy and recovered the points breached by the enemy. The forward positions in Xiaonanxiang have been fully restored. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, and our troops also sustained losses. There were no changes at Guangfu and other points north of Xiaonanxiang. Our troops have not retreated to Dengqiao on the line of Shi Xiang Gong Temple. Our troops are only a few hundred meters away from Shi Xiang Gong Temple.</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battle Unleashed in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Mutual Bombardment Several Times Yesterday and Today, Enemy Ships Heavily Damaged, Enemy Burns Our Sheds and Massacres Our Civilians</p>
<p>Our artillery positions in Pudong launched another fierce artillery battle with enemy ships in the Huangpu River last night. The first battle was at 8:05 PM. Our troops first fired artillery, breaking the silence of the entire line. The enemy ships hastily returned fire in a coordinated manner. The shelling was quite dense. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, we fired a total of over thirty shells, many of which landed in the enemy positions in Zhabei, causing extreme chaos on their side. The enemy ships fired a total of over seventy shells, most of which landed in the fields. However, three or four sulfur shells landed in the sheds next to Pudong Avenue, east of Tangqiao Qingyang Road, igniting them immediately. Because some residents from Jiangbei were unable to escape, four people were tragically burned to death, and six were burned. The Pudong Fire Brigade was dispatched to provide assistance. Because the fire spread rapidly, also affecting the tile houses to the west, the fire was too large to control, and it was difficult to provide assistance. The fire was completely extinguished at 3:00 AM this morning, destroying over fifty sheds and forty tile houses. The second artillery battle began at 10:30 PM. Our side again fired first, and the enemy ships returned fire fiercely, sometimes densely and sometimes sparsely. When our air force first flew over Shanghai, the enemy ships stopped firing first. We continued to fire many shots to assist the air force in its operations. The third artillery battle began at 11:45 PM. Because the enemy ships had been severely damaged by us twice, they first fired in retaliation, concentrating their fire on the ×× area. However, our artillery teams, with their mission completed, only returned fire a few times and then ignored them. After the enemy ships bombarded for about twenty minutes, seeing that we did not react, they also stopped. After these three artillery battles, because the enemy shells were indiscriminate, several civilian houses in various places were bombed, killing five or six civilians. Those injured included Chen Zhanggen, Shi Deshun, Wei Zhaolin, Chen Longgen, Hang Qinshi, Ni Jinxiang, Bao Agen, Bao Lushi, Li Lushi, Chen Zhangshi, Yao Zhangshi, Yao Caishi, Fan Zhigen, and over ten other men and women. At 9:30 AM this morning, enemy ships again fiercely bombarded the Pudong area. At the same time, three enemy planes appeared in the sky from time to time, but they flew quite high and often disappeared into the clouds, making it difficult to perform their duties. The sound of enemy ship artillery fire was sometimes dense and sometimes sparse, and it had not stopped by noon. Our troops, undamaged, did not pay attention to it except to strengthen their guard along the entire line. Also, at 5:45 PM last night, three enemy heavy bombers flew from the Zhabei area to the rear of the old Sanjing warehouse in Pudong, dropping four bombs in succession, destroying seven civilian houses, and injuring three women, Zhou Azhen, Shao Wushi, and Zhang Qiaozhen. An old woman, Zhou Xiaoshi, was killed.</p>
<p>At around 12:40 PM this afternoon, more than ten enemy heavy bombers flew to Pudong again and indiscriminately bombed the area in retaliation. Our positions were not damaged at all.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Night Raid Achieves Great Success</h3>
<p>Destroys Enemy Ordnance Inside the Shanghai Grand Theatre</p>
<p>At around 1:00 AM this morning, our air force made its last raid on enemy positions in Shanghai. When it flew past the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road, our planes dropped two incendiary bombs, which immediately ignited a fire that could not be approached. The theatre was almost completely destroyed, and the fire spread to more than ten nearby houses. It is said that the enemy troops inside the theatre had stored a large amount of ordnance, and their losses were enormous. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. Afterwards, our planes completed their mission and turned north to bomb the enemy positions at the North Station and the Lianglu Administration, but they missed their target. The bombs landed nearby and destroyed many houses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Generals Nakamura and Others Have Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Enemy Ships Unload War Horses and Military Supplies, Four Torpedo Boats Arrive at the Songhu Estuary</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Tokyo has recently sent two lieutenant generals, Mutsu and Nakamura, to Shanghai to assist Matsui and others in carrying out their acts of aggression. The two lieutenant generals arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. After the enemy occupied our Zhabei and Jiangwan, they held a meeting of senior generals to discuss strategies for continuing their invasion. The two lieutenant generals also participated in the meeting. It has been found that Nakamura is one of the members of the enemy's War Against China Committee. Central News Agency reports that around 9:00 AM today (the 29th), the enemy merchant ship Bailing Maru, converted into a transport ship and fully loaded with gasoline, continued to unload at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. In addition, the enemy transport ship Yayun Maru, number 334, which arrived yesterday, unloaded more than 300 war horses at the Huangpu Wharf. The transport ship Rokkosan Maru, number 99, docked at the Osaka Wharf, and the Shenxiang Maru docked at the central wharf of the China Merchants Bureau, unloading a total of more than 2,000 boxes of military supplies.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that four enemy torpedo boats have recently arrived at the Wusong Estuary. According to sources, the enemy intends to sail these torpedo boats into the Yangtze River, with other plans. It is also known that the enemy transport ship Ottsze has arrived at Shijiangjiao in Chongming, carrying 350 cans of mustard gas and yellow cross gas. In addition, an enemy aircraft carrier, carrying 45 aircraft and 4,000 large and small bombs, set sail from Sasebo yesterday (the 28th) and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Our Isolated Troops Vow to Protect Every Inch of Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Public Admires Them, Cheering "Long Live!" Across the Suzhou River, Enemy Troops Fiercely Attacked More Than Ten Times Last Night, All Repelled</p>
<p>Our brave isolated troops in Zhabei remain safely stationed in the Four Banks Warehouse as of this afternoon. Although enemy troops have attacked several times from last night until this morning, they have all been repelled by our troops. Moreover, at 7:30 AM this morning, more than ten enemy soldiers who attacked were killed, and the rest were seriously injured and escaped. Thinking of our troops who are resolutely defending the area cannot help but fill one with respect and cause one to bow one's head in contemplation, marveling at the greatness of the Chinese nation, which cannot be easily insulted by the enemy. Currently, the entire public has expressed sympathy for the arduous struggle of our brave isolated troops and is willing to provide support. In addition to raising a large amount of food to be delivered to them, people from European and American countries are also amazed at the eternity and immortality of our national spirit. The highest military authorities are also paying close attention, and a telegram was sent to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>National Flag Flies, Public Pays Respect</p>
<p>The loyal and brave soldiers who are defending the Four Banks Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei at the cost of their lives presented a Blue Sky with a White Sun flag, which was obtained by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM yesterday, through the No. 41 Girl Scout. It was raised to the top of the warehouse at around 6:00 PM. This morning, as the dawn broke, the national flag fluttered, showing their spirit of loyalty, bravery, and vigor. Members of the public who passed by the area across the river took off their hats and bowed, paying their respects to the national flag and the loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>Brave Soldiers Shout "Long Live the Republic of China!"</p>
<p>At 3:00 AM and 7:10 AM this morning, enemy troops twice charged our positions at the warehouse, but they were both repelled by our troops. At daybreak this morning, reporters went to Avenue Edward VII and Changsha Road to investigate. At that time, the area was already crowded with people who wanted to see our loyal and brave soldiers. When our citizens saw the Blue Sky with a White Sun on a field of red national flag fluttering on the roof of the Four Banks Warehouse and in the windows, they rejoiced and cheered, clapping their hands. The troops guarding the warehouse responded by shouting "Long Live the Republic of China!" The voices were extremely tragic. After a while, the sound of rifles rang out, as more than ten enemy soldiers came charging. The nearby police, fearing stray bullets, earnestly advised the citizens to disperse. At that time, the sound of machine guns rang out. It was our troops firing, aiming at the enemy and sweeping them away, killing several enemy soldiers, and the rest fled in panic. At 7:10 AM, there was sparse rifle fire again. It was the enemy's second charge, but the result was that they were repelled by our loyal and brave soldiers. Since then, there have been no more attacks, but the enemy in the Qianye United Warehouse and the Shanghai Bank warehouse next door have been constantly firing rifles at the location. In order to save ammunition, our troops are ignoring it. Some passersby were moved to tears, which shows the public's love and support for the soldiers.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Fiercely Attack, Repelled by Us</p>
<p>Our eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers, with the determination to sacrifice themselves heroically, are fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. This kind of noble and great spirit has won infinite admiration internationally. This morning, a reporter went to Xinzha Road and inspected the area by the river for two hours. From a distance, I saw our bright and dazzling Blue Sky with a White Sun on a field of red national flag fluttering on the roof of the Four Banks Warehouse, an aura of inviolability, which truly demonstrates the soul of the Chinese nation, making the brutal enemy afraid to approach. The Fuyuan and Fukang Qianzhuang United Warehouse to the west has been occupied by the enemy. There are thirty or forty enemy soldiers on the roof of the warehouse, busily making defensive preparations to prevent our troops from attacking. The enemy troops near the northern end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge are also piling up sandbags, making defensive works. After 8:00 AM, the sound of rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades was incessant in the northwest corner of the Four Banks Warehouse, as the enemy troops attacked from Guoging Road and Guangfu Road. At the intersection of Wuzhen Road and Kulun Road, the enemy troops are setting up a steel gun battery, seemingly attempting to destroy the warehouse building. According to the owner of a store near the southern end of the Wuzhen Bridge on Xinzha Road, the enemy troops launched more than ten attacks last night, and the sound of rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades was incessant, but they were all repelled by our loyal and brave soldiers, and sixty or seventy enemy soldiers were killed, so that the enemy troops did not dare to approach the warehouse. The reporter went to the Xinlaji Bridge area again at 10:00 AM to investigate. Because the police were afraid that stray bullets would injure or kill passersby, they had blocked the Xinzha Wujiao Port on Avenue Yu Xiaqing with barbed wire. However, there were many people in the area, carrying bread, soy sauce, refined salt, and other food, preparing to send them to the soldiers, but they could not enter, which they were very moved by, which shows the deep concern of the people in the rear for our loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>Enemy Plane Shot and Wounded But Still Escapes</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM this morning, an enemy plane flew low and circled over the Four Banks Warehouse, reconnoitering the movements of our eight hundred heroes. Our troops immediately opened fire with rifles, hitting the tail of the plane. The plane suddenly swayed from side to side, teetering on the verge of falling, but it still managed to escape back to its original position.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Bombard Xiamen Fortress</h3>
<p>Jinmen Refugees Flee in Droves, Xiamen's Coastal Defenses Are Extremely Solid</p>
<p>[Xiamen] After the enemy occupied Jinmen, the number of enemy ships in the waters between Jinmen and Xiamen increased to two or three, mostly docked in the southern part of Jin Island. At 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM on the 28th, four ships twice bombarded the Baishi Battery and Beiqi firing positions of the Xiamen Fortress, but because of the distance, they all landed in the water and then retreated. On the 28th, the enemy marines continued to search and loot in Jinmen, detaining strong young men from various villages. Many women and young people were abducted and raped. Refugees fled to Xiamen by the thousands on the 26th and 27th, and three or four thousand fled to Tong'an. Compatriots from Xiamen organized relief teams, and on the 28th, they sent personnel to Jinmen to try to provide relief to the refugees and help them escape from danger. Currently, strong men in the villages of Xiyuan in the northern part of Jin Island are still resisting. The enemy is advancing northward. County Magistrate Kuang Han is still working on Dadaeng Island. The person detained by the ×× Division is Liao Bingtao, the head of the First District. The coastal defenses of Xiamen and Tong'an are extremely solid. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Front Silent</h3>
<p>[Xuzhou] Railway news. News from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway front is silent. The enemy is exerting all its strength in the Shanghai battle, and it seems that it does not have the ability to advance on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. We have set up strict fortifications on the Yucheng line to defend against enemy attacks. Guerrilla units have penetrated deep into the northern section to attack and raid. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>US Representative Arrives in Brussels, Germany Has Received Invitation and Will Likely Accept</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Pleased with US Cooperation</p>
<p>[Paris] Davis, the chief representative of the United States at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, arrived here yesterday from the United States and has already left for Brussels this afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)</p>
<p>[London] During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne made a declaration on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that it was gratifying that the conference venue was changed from Geneva to Brussels so that the United States could participate in the conference on an equal footing with other relevant countries, instead of just sending observers to attend. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the invitation issued by the Belgian government was delivered to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. The foreign affairs authorities immediately studied it. According to well-informed sources, the German government will accept the invitation to participate in the conference. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Times recently commented on Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying that although the conference will not have Japan's participation, it can still carry out beneficial work and allow countries related to the Far East issue to discuss the changes that have occurred in China and the relationship between these changes and the principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty. The League of Nations recently avoided interfering in the dispute between China and Japan, which was extremely wise. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will also definitely not attempt to interfere. If this conference can study various mediation methods to promote a quick resolution of the dispute between China and Japan, it can be said to be beneficial. The "Righteous People's Discussion" reported that "the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will try to protect the interests that the relevant countries hold in the Far East. Apart from this, it may be difficult to carry out any effective work. The bravery of the Chinese army in resisting the war is beyond Japan's expectations. I fear that Japan will eventually have to end the war to save face." (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government's newspaper, News, recently commented that it is clumsy and useless to convene a conference to discuss practical measures to stop illegal and sinful adventures. On the contrary, if the directly related countries can take joint action to deal with the aggression on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, that would be enough. After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is held in Beijing, a new non-interference committee may soon be established, which is not certain. It is intended that Germany and Italy have obviously obtained Japan's permission to send personnel to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, in order to represent the allied countries that specialize in aggression and violate international treaties. In this way, even if Japan does not attend, there will be people to speak for it. It is a pity that the so-called Western democratic countries do not have the necessary determination and perseverance to maintain peace in the Far East. In the United States, Japan's aggression is a very serious blow to the interests that the United States holds in the Liaodong region. President Roosevelt expressed a more practical attitude towards maintaining peace in his recent speech. This diplomatic policy of the United States may contribute something to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Central News Agency dispatch from Havas on the 28th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting said in a speech at the National Press Club luncheon today that China has made more progress in the past ten years than in the past hundred years, and in many ways, it has surpassed Japan. Japan is worried that China will complete its work, so it is fighting against China in order to stop its progress, but Japan will definitely not succeed. The Chinese people are determined to resist to the end, and even if they have only one soldier and one bullet left, they will fight. (Central News Agency dispatch from Reuters on the 28th)</p>
<h3>British Military Authorities Express Continued Efforts to Defend Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Evacuate Overseas Chinese to Avoid Accidents, Rumors of Abandonment Are Completely Untrue</p>
<p>After the war front moved, the situation in the western Shanghai outer road area became tense. The area was filled with dense gunfire and stray bullets all day long. British Consul General in Shanghai Phillips immediately issued a notice, fearing that the war would expand and affect residents, so he advised Western expatriates to evacuate when necessary to avoid danger. From today (the 29th), Western expatriates residing in the area of Avenue Entingy, Avenue Haig, Yuyuan Road, Avenue Bai Li Nan, and Avenue de President Doumer have begun to evacuate, and boxes and luggage are filling the streets in an endless stream. The troops stationed here and the police are taking care of everything, so the order is good. However, after the notice was issued, a rumor suddenly arose in the city that the concession authorities would abandon police power in the western Shanghai area, and that the air forces stationed in the outer road sections of all countries would retreat. According to British military authorities, they will not take this measure and absolutely deny the rumor. They also said that evacuating overseas Chinese is one thing, and continuing to do their best to defend the area is another.</p>
<h3>Mail Inquiries Should Be Made to the Management Bureau</h3>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The August 13th War of Resistance. We had already decided our destiny. Prepared for great sacrifice. Great destruction. But never compromise with the enemy. Never stop halfway. This is the predetermined decision of our country's military authorities. It has been nearly three months since the start of the war. With the superiority of the enemy's weapons, it is not easy for us to obtain absolute victory. However, since the enemy started the war, there have been more than 70,000 casualties. The price they paid cannot be said to be insignificant. Although we have not achieved the greatest military victory, there have been many victories outside the military sphere. 1. The War of Resistance has led to national unity. 2. Soldiers have gained rich experience. 3. Increased determination to resist the enemy. The above three points are not only of great hope for the military, but also of infinite optimism for the spirit of the nation. The enemy should not boast about the small victories in front of them. Xiang Yu experienced more than 70 battles and never lost, but in the end he committed suicide on the Wu River. Let's see the results of this war.</p>

<h3>Front and Rear (2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Uncle Di</p>
<p>Therefore, the reporter first raised the following question: 'Since the outbreak of this Sino-Japanese War, looking at the objective situation from all sides, and the determination expressed by both the government and the public, it seems that the war will not stop until the very end. If this continues, it may evolve into a world war. Then, in Mr. Chen's opinion, is there a possibility for China and Japan to call a halt to the war at a certain stage?'</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said: 'That is possible.'</p>
<p>Then, he explained further: 'The ultimate goal of the Chinese nation's resistance war is liberation and national construction. However, such a goal may not be achievable through a single war. When the war reaches a certain stage, perhaps due to the evolution of various situations, under certain conditions, we may have a chance to breathe and temporarily call a halt to the war to facilitate the next resistance war…'</p>
<p>'Then, what are the so-called certain conditions…!' The reporter interrupted him.</p>
<p>'For example, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, the return of Peiping and Tianjin, ... and so on. However, interference in internal affairs is no longer tolerable! If it goes on like this, it will be a situation of partial peace.'</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, it seems that if there is to be 'peace,' it must be complete; since it is 'partial,' objectively speaking, it will not be 'peaceful'?" The reporter tentatively added.</p>
<p>'In fact, the enemy will not even allow us a partial peace.' One of the people present added.</p>
<p>Chen Guangsheng then said with emotion: 'Therefore, even a situation of partial peace requires a very difficult struggle. Here, there are three decisive forces: first, military force; second, the power of the people; and third, international support.'</p>
<p>The theme of the conversation fell on the prospects of victory or defeat in this war. The reporter then took the opportunity to ask Mr. Chen the following question:</p>
<p>"Looking at the overall situation from all aspects, we cannot find a point of certain victory, nor can we see a point of certain defeat. So, regarding the issue of the victory or defeat of this anti-Japanese war, which is of concern to the whole world and anxiety to all of China, what is Mr. Chen's opinion?"</p>
<p>'In my opinion,' Mr. Chen said, 'Judging by military strength alone, we are far behind. However, our most powerful weapons are the assistance of friendly countries internationally and the mobilization of the vast masses of the people nationwide to serve as the backbone of the war.' The reporter briefly described some of what he knew about the situation between friendly countries and China, using these as a starting point, and then asked Mr. Chen:</p>
<p>'What are Mr. Chen's thoughts on the recently announced Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact?'</p>
<p>Mr. Chen immediately said in an impassioned tone: 'From the perspective of resistance strength, if all the agreements between China and the Soviet Union are limited to the announced agreements, then at this time, it is really of no use!.'</p>
<p>Due to the entanglement of international relations in Europe, Soviet Russia decided to use all its strength to help us. Conversely, assuming that Soviet Russia really openly and frankly stood up to help China, then, in the current international environment, it may instead be detrimental to China's resistance war, it is also unknown,' Mr. Chen said.</p>
<p>From Mr. Chen's words, I infer that his meaning is probably that China's resistance war this time should, as much as possible, obtain the assistance of all countries in the world other than Japanese imperialists, and should not prematurely limit itself, excluding a portion of countries from military assistance.</p>
<p>If my understanding of Mr. Chen's opinion is correct, then the next question is: Is this idea of hoping to obtain assistance from all countries in the world just a fantasy?</p>
<p>I tentatively asked: 'The formation of two major blocs internationally is progressing rapidly. If China wants to be completely liberated, it must use this international situation in the future. However, looking back on China's current resistance war, on the eve of the international situation not being fully mature, China seems to not need to emphasize this situation?'</p>
<p>Mr. Chen nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Another issue is the mobilization of the masses.</p>
<p>I spoke first: 'Mobilizing the vast masses to support this comprehensive and protracted war against Japan is, in principle, a consensus of opinion from all sides. If the Chinese nation wants to achieve victory in the anti-Japanese war, it can only be achieved by mobilizing the entire people.'</p>
<p>'Yes.' Mr. Chen interrupted me and added: 'Seeking victory in the current war is certainly the most immediate task of mobilizing the masses; however, the greatest goal is to guarantee future victory. In other words, even if military defeat is inevitable for China at present, we must resist to the end and hope to achieve final victory. That task can only be shouldered by mobilizing the vast masses.'</p>
<h3>Xiamen Municipal Government Holds Supplemental Levy on Taxpayers of Taiwanese Origin Who Fraudulently Obtained Residency</h3>
<p>Past Unpaid Taxes and Levies are Cleared and Paid Retroactively, Hereafter All Taxes Will be Paid in Accordance with Regulations Like Nationals</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, The number of Taiwanese Japanese nationals residing in Xiamen is close to 20,000, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total population of Xiamen. Recently, the Taiwanese people have carried out a general evacuation, and more than 2,000 people have not left. The municipal government then held a registration of Taiwanese people. It is estimated that more than 1,020 Taiwanese people in the Xiamen urban area have registered in accordance with the order, and 300 people in the suburban Heshan District have almost all registered. 700 to 800 people are hiding in the Gulangyu Concession, and the Public Concession is also holding registration. Only 240 people have registered. There are many Taiwanese people in Xiamen, and all industries are represented. In the past, relying on the power of the Japanese, they resisted the payment of taxes on their industrial and commercial operations and their real estate, land, and farmland. As for the movable property of all industries in Xiamen, according to a estimate by the Taiwan Shinmin Daily News the year before last, it was more than 26 million yuan. Therefore, the loss of tax revenue suffered by our country is extremely large. At the same time, Chinese businessmen are unable to compete because of the tax burden. A small number of unscrupulous Chinese people colluded with the Taiwanese people to fraudulently use the Taiwanese identity. This time, the municipal government held registration, and 120 Chinese businessmen who fraudulently used the Taiwanese identity registered their letters of repentance and offered national defense funds. On the 18th, the municipal government issued a notice on the method of collecting and supplementing the taxes owed by Taiwanese and fraudulently registered merchants. The notice roughly stated, 'According to the report of the Finance Bureau, the Taiwanese merchants in our city only paid 1,000 yuan per month to the Taiwan Association as police donations for various taxes that should be paid in the past, and did not comply with the regulations in other respects. Even Chinese merchants have fraudulently registered to resist donations, which has affected tax revenue. Now, although most of the Taiwanese merchants have returned to their country, there are still many who operate and reside in this city. In particular, many of their leased properties, shops, houses, and land are leased to Chinese merchants for use. All kinds of taxes and rents that should be paid should be ordered to be completed in accordance with the regulations together with the citizens. The unpaid taxes and donations from the past should also be cleared and supplemented. A method is proposed and submitted for approval.' It was approved by the provincial government and reported to the Xiamen Garrison Headquarters for record, and the Finance Bureau was ordered to comply with it quickly. The notice is hereby issued. The following is a summary of the Xiamen Municipal Finance Bureau's method of collecting and supplementing various taxes and rents owed by Taiwanese and fraudulently registered merchants in this city. ㊀ Taiwanese or fraudulently registered merchants shall pay and register from August onwards and taxes will be calculated and levied according to regulations. Those before August shall be required to submit receipts and certificates issued by the former Taiwan Association on behalf of the municipal government and police stations within a time limit. If there is a shortage, it must still be supplemented. If the aforementioned receipts and certificates cannot be submitted within the time limit, the amount of owed donations shall be calculated at the rate and supplemented. ㊁ Taiwanese or fraudulently registered merchants shall pay shop tax, land rent, business tax, license tax, slaughter tax, and all other taxes and rents stipulated in the same way as citizens. Various taxes that were owed in the past shall be cleared separately, and the total amount shall be calculated, and they shall be ordered to pay in installments. The method will be determined separately. ㊂ Taiwanese or Japanese merchants shall pay various taxes and rents that should be paid and supplemented by the current residents, operators, or tenants, agents, etc. They shall be responsible for paying on behalf of the business households or the income of the shop owner. If there is no one living or operating in the house or shop, they will wait for someone to take over or live in and assume the responsibility, and they will be handled according to the above method. ㊃ Taiwanese merchants who rent real estate within the boundaries of this city shall comply with the method of tax deeds for foreigners who permanently lease housing land promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. If they are fraudulently postponing taxes, the business households or agents shall be ordered to submit the deeds within a time limit and pay taxes in accordance with the regulations. ㊄ The currently operating Taiwanese and fraudulently registered brothels and prostitutes shall be ordered to report their brands and pay donations in accordance with the regulations, otherwise they will be ordered to close down. ㊅ If Taiwanese merchants and Chinese merchants jointly operate industrial and commercial enterprises or jointly own real estate, and the shares of the Taiwanese people have been transferred to Chinese merchants, they shall be ordered to submit proof documents. After verification, the various taxes and rents that should be paid shall be paid by the current business owner or the current business owner. The households are responsible for paying. If the discount has not been made or proof cannot be provided, the outstanding taxes owed in the past shall be paid in full by the current shop owner or owner. The amount paid on behalf of the Taiwanese people shall be deducted from the income of the Taiwanese people. However, if there are any outstanding payments for the part that should be paid by Chinese merchants, they shall still be supplemented in full. ㊆ If Taiwanese or fraudulently registered merchants fail to comply with the above methods for paying taxes and supplementing donations, the bureau may send their responsible persons to the police to collect them. ㊇ This method will be implemented from the date of approval by the provincial government for record. The provincial government recently established a 'Guidance Committee for Naturalized Taiwanese People' in the provincial capital and plans to establish a branch in Xiamen. The Anti-Enemy Association will coordinate with various organizations to organize the naturalization procedures for Taiwanese people. ㊀ First apply to the local government for registration to obtain nationality, ㊁ Investigate the previous occupation of Taiwanese people and what skills they have, and introduce them to appropriate occupations to enable them to make a living in peace. ㊂ Send people to have individual political talks or public speeches with them to make them all have a national concept, enhance their anti-enemy sentiment, and participate in practical national salvation work. After Xiamen held the registration of Taiwanese people last month, more than 200 people have applied to renounce their Japanese nationality and restore their Chinese nationality. As for the Taiwanese people who withdrew from Xiamen to Taiwan, the Japanese government set up two major detention centers in Keelung City to accommodate them, sent police to monitor their actions, and were not allowed to leave Keelung City for other parts of the interior of Taiwan, fearing that they had lived in China for a long time and had the national ideology of the motherland, which would be passed on to the islanders. Therefore, the Taiwanese people all call them human cages. The extent of their foolishness and defense against the people can be seen from their hard work. (October 21)</p>

<p>Wartime Youth No. 25</p>
<h3>Final Victory Under Overall Resistance War (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Weizu</p>
<p>Third, in the military direction, Japan is also in a dangerous situation everywhere. China's war of resistance is the mobilization of the entire nation. Everyone contributes manpower and material resources to supply the country, while Japan only has the ambition of a few warlords. In terms of the soldiers' hearts and the public's psychology, there is no strong self-confidence. Our country has been stimulated for many years, and the impression of Japan's evil is deeply rooted. Therefore, everyone has the determination to die. Looking at the Japanese soldiers' operations this time, most of them are not voluntary. Some have fled, and some have committed suicide. If the war is prolonged, the soldiers will definitely rebel against the officers. The ability to fight depends entirely on their general psychology. If the psychology is unstable, it will not be easy to win the war. Now, let's classify them: ㊀ Japanese regular soldiers have no combat ability: The Japanese regular army has only 27 divisions, about 500,000 people. The equipment held by these 500,000 people is excellent, but most of these active 500,000 people have an unstable psychology and little war experience. Because Japan has a conscription system, the so-called regular soldiers are new recruits. Although they have been trained for many years, and they are all 17 or 18-year-old youths, these youths have unstable souls, no combat experience, and no determination to fight. In fact, it is difficult to participate in combat. However, due to the Japanese system, they know that these people cannot fight, but they have no choice but to send some of them to China. ㊁ Reservists and veterans have no combat ability: Japan's reservists and veterans are all people who have been away from the military for a long time, and even do not hold exercises at all. They are shopkeepers, clerks, farmers, elementary school teachers, and machine office workers. They have always lived a stable social life, enjoying a comfortable life. At home, they have gentle and harmonious parents, brothers, lively and lovely wives, children, and daughters. Once they are asked to take guns and cross the distant ocean to fight China for no reason, their families will definitely suffer, and even their lives will have problems. They know that war requires life to be exchanged for territory. How can they be willing to give up their good families? How much effect will it have to send these veterans who are unfamiliar with war to fight others? As for the Chinese army, it is a recruitment system. Chinese soldiers are a profession. After they join the army, they live in the barracks all the time. If they do not die in battle or become disabled or old, they will not stop this life. They are all standing experienced soldiers and have no family nostalgia. Therefore, they have the nature and discipline of pure soldiers who are cheerful and brave. They only know how to defend the country and obey orders, and regard this as their duty. In addition to performing this duty, there is no more glorious task than war. Now it is a fact that the Japanese army has occupied our North China, it is also a fact that hundreds of enemy ships and hundreds of planes have bombarded Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi with artillery and bombs, and it is also a fact that tens of thousands of enemy troops have launched an aggressive war in Zhabei and Wusong. These facts are all placed before our eyes and deeply imprinted in the minds of our soldiers. There is no need for officers to explain and explain to them. They will naturally charge towards the enemy, destroy the enemy with the determination to die, and defend the country with the determination to die. When everyone is performing his duty, his bravery and loyalty are conceivable. ㊂ The puppet Manchu army refuses to be used by him; In this North China and Songhu battle, Japan incorporated the slave puppet Manchu army into the battle because the army was not enough to control. This is a suicidal policy. The suffering suffered by the people of East China for six years has never ceased to think of revenge, but there is no opportunity. If propaganda and explanation are added, their rebellion will be as easy as turning their hands. According to this comparison of the three items, Japan is using deception and coercion to pull the people and puppet troops across the ocean to fight, and we are being directly inspired by the aggressors to resist the aggressors. They are being deceived and forced to invade other people's operations, one is automatic, the other is passive. Since the tasks of the two sides in the war are different, the effects are naturally different. As for who will win or lose in the war constituted by these two armies, everyone can judge. Our country has an old saying: 'The teacher who is sad wins' How can China not win?</p>
<p>Based on this observation, it fully shows that the Japanese army does not have the strength for a long-term war, while China has the determination to resist to the end. These factors all expose Japan's weakness in not being able to have a long-term war with China. Prime Minister Konoe once said on the way back from visiting Prince Saionji in Hakone: 'If the war against China is prolonged, it will fall into China's tactics, so we will try our best to avoid a long-term war and quickly take effective solutions. This clearly shows that Japan cannot have a long-term war. If China can unite as a country, not yield, not compromise, and resist to the end, then we can verify what Chairman Chiang said, 'The final victory belongs to us. '"</p>
<p>Finally, we must grasp the following three points: first, have confidence; second, do not seek luck; third, do not be content and compromise.</p>
