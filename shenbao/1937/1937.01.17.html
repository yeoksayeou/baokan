<h3>東行鱗爪</h3>
<p>— 林谷</p>
<p>㊀恭賀新禧的嬌氣年</p>
<p>一九三六年在緊張空氣中一點一滴地過去了。照例到了年末的當兒，一切都要告一個段落，把一年來的成績淸算一下。因此，有許多標新立異的人們，總喜歡抓住這一年中的主要特點，給他一個新的各詞。記得在國內的時候，大家都把一九三四年呌做雜誌年，一九三五年呌做傚觀印古書年，但是也有些人們以為一九三五年應該呌做小品文年。剛過去的一九三六年，究竟應該呌做什麼年呢？到現在我還不知道，我想。大概仍舊呌做雜誌年，也許不算錯吧。</p>
<p>東京的人士們，也有同樣的脾氣的。譬如一九三五年吧，牠們就呌做軍需景氣年。其實，日本的軍需景氣，不僅在一九三五年，三三，三四年又何嘗不景氣呢，不過，在一九三五年，劫是“集景氣之大成”吧了。</p>
<p>在一九三六年，有些熟悉日本經濟界情形的人們，却仍主張稱牠為軍需景氣年：因為在過去一年中，軍需事業的膨脹，不但不比三五年差，反而隨着國際軍備竸爭的積極發廢，比三五年更進一步的發達了。因軍需的膨賬，而發生了鋼鐵恐慌問題，石油資源問題。因軍需工業的膨脹，而使農村的農民人數，一天天减少。因此，有人，大聲疾呼着，“這是日本的當前危機，農民回到農村去！减輕農民的重累！”</p>
<p>翻開年末的最後一二天報紙一番，在各報的“社會版”上，突然發見了，今年是“恭賀新禧的景氣年”八個大字。</p>
<p>怎麼呌做恭賀新禧的景氣年呢？換句話說，一九三六年年末日本全國賀年電報賀年片等的寄遞數着，平均差不多增加一倍。如果僅拿東京市來說，那末，賀年電報的收增加三倍，賀年片的收發增0·九倍，據東京遞信省的報告，負年片賀年電報突然增加的原因，第一是軍需景氣的刺激，第二是電報費减低，新設賀年郵資（一分五厘賀年特用）之心理的刺激，第三是遞信省宣傳的得法，也是社會文化向上的表現。可是，另外有一部份人們，以為這是社會文化向下的表現。是個人與個人間的生存門爭，集團與集團間的傾軋現象，日益顯著化的事實的表微。因鬥爭傾軋的劇烈，不得不想出形形色色的花樣來，拉攏自己的幫手。</p>
<p>究竟是文化向上呢？抑還是文化向下？在這件小小事件上，似乎含着深長的意味的。</p>
<p>㊁悲觀論調的不同看法</p>
<p>也許是今年特有的現象吧。在這軍需景氣蒸蒸日上的過程中，東京各報，以及各有北景的各雜結，似乎不約而同地都流露出一些悲觀的成份來，不是說外交失敗，便是說政局前途的多雜，不是說財界的危機，便是說農村沒落的可慮，不是為政黨撑腰，便是為軍部做一啦啦隊一。其中却也有許多人贏唱折衷的論調。五花八門，形形色色，輿論界，眞像是紊亂的複雜的思想鬥爭的塲所。因此在出版界上，又有小冊子（pampblet）景氣年的雅號。</p>
<p>我們舉個例吧，在報紙方面，最近代衆財閥意識的論調，頗為濃厚。如東京銷數最多的朝日新聞，他的年末最後一天社評的題目是：“站在光明與黑暗中間的世相”，對於國民生活重累的增加，虛無的事樂的追求，時代的昏迷與社會的憂鬰，人民政治憼的加强，中堅份子貪汚事件的迭出不窮，親子殺父以圖騙得保險金等犯罪案伴的發生，抱着無限的悲觀態度。牠的中心的論點，似乎在如何解除這非常時的國民負担。</p>
<p>但是，站在另一個立塲—强力政治觀點的立塲。又有不同的見解，不同的觀察。</p>
<p>我們就拿少壯軍人辦的雜誌，新問題做代表吧，在過去一年中，牠曾經痛憤非常地指出：“一九三六年是混亂，騷迷，希望黯淡的一年！世紀末的社會現象！及社會的文化的展開的一年！在經濟方面，有國營興民營的决戰，在社會方面，有右冀陣營中心的新國民運動的產生，但是，在左冀陣營中，又有去冬東京市議會選舉，無產派勢力的合法的抬頭，在文化方面，一般重要的報紙雜誌，自二二六事變以後，差不多從指導社會的立塲，完全攢到商業本位的立塲上去，如東京的朝日新聞，就是一例。最近東京各主要雜誌報紙對日德協定取批判態度，簡直是我國（日本）新聞史上未曾有的墮落的表現”。</p>
<p>以上不過摘錄了該雜誌全篇的大意，這種針鋒相對的論調，這種各個不同的看法，相激相盪，差不多把日本社會的整個輪廓，粗枝大葉地顯示在我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>㊂百分之五的敬意</p>
<p>最近東京帝大教授大內兵衛，說了一句頗幽默的話：“百分之五的敬意！”</p>
<p>所謂“百分之五”的意思，是指十二年度的廳大預算增加額，實達十億六千五百萬元，其中國民生活安定費，洪五千三百萬元，恰當全部增加額的百分之五。</p>
<p>這百分之五的國民生活安定費中，用途却有一大批如河川改修，災害防止呀！如林業施股，農村經濟更生之特別補助呀！如穀物檢查之國營，中小商業之金融補助呀！如農山漁紂諸組合團體之事業補助呀！各門各額，眞不勝枚舉！</p>
<p>老百姓們對於這些補助費始終是感激的，可是感激的成份，却也只有百分之五！</p>
<p>此外，大內教授還列舉·些統計，指出非常時期的五年間，－般動勞大衆的生活狀態。他說：“五年來，動勞大衆的生計指數與所得指數，顯然呈着矛盾傾向的擴大狀態，卽一方面生活費指數的不斷增高，另一方面所得工錢的實質指數，却不斷地遞减。如把昭和六年十一月的生活費指數為一五九，那末，到了昭和十一年（卽一九三六年）十月就增加至一八三九，其中衣服等費用，增加三成七，飲食等費用增加三成九。但是，工綫所得的實數呢？在昭和六年還有九二·六（以昭和四年為一00），到了昭和十一年却减至八一·六之下了。”</p>
<p>這樣，相反的傾向一直發展下去，大衆的生活，是不堪設想的。可更，我們在十二月二十九日的讀賣新聞上，却看見：“三菱重工業一舉倍額增資”的新聞咧！</p>

<h3>改新的三箇階段</h3>
<p>— 徐旭生</p>
<p>大凡在一箇社會裏面，大多數的民衆還能安居樂業的時候，不惟改革的事實，就是改革的思想也是不容易發生的。等到那裏面一大部分的民衆生計不容易維持的時候，那改革的思想才容易發生，並且要迅速地傳播。接續著，改革也就要由思想變成事實。這種社會的大改革，通常可分辨出三種態度；因爲它們常相連續，也可以説是改革時期的三箇階段。社會內容的簡單複雜的程度不同，因而改革的性質亦異，所以有些改革，三箇階段未能完備，有些雖大致完備，而迅速經過，不容易分辨出來。我國近百年來的改革，內容異常繁富，而慢騰騰的又是我國很顯著的國民性，所以這三箇階段異常顯著，它的性質略如以下所説：</p>
<p>第一個階段：當時社會的情狀不佳，是有如識的人們全可以看得出的；窮則變，變則通，也是大多數有思想的人們全可以感覺到的；如果當時有另外的文化接觸，那取人之長，補己之短，也應該是主張改革的人們所全體要求的。但是，因爲當時所看到的不過是社會的表面現象，根本的思想還没有受着震動，所以，何者爲長？何者爲短？選擇的標準爲何？這一類的問題，在當時全覺得是很簡單的。凡同舊日的主要思想相合的，就是應該接受的；相異的，就是應該拒絶的。接受與拒絶，全以原有的主要思想爲準繩。前淸末年革新家所主張的中學爲體，西學爲用，就是這樣的辦法。這樣的改革，因爲根本的觀念毫無變動，所以很容易爲大家所承受，可是它的成功與否，那就要看當日被採擇的文化同舊有的文化差異的程度若何了。文化的自身，也就像其他的生物，自有個體，自有生活。剪芽接枝，雖説是植物間常見的事情，可是，鴉梨的芽子必須接到杜梨的根株上面，蜜桃的芽子必須接到山桃的根株上面，才可發榮滋長，結很好的菓實。如果相反過來，鴉梨與山桃相接，蜜桃與杜梨相連，那接上去的芽子，一定枯萎，不要再説能開花結實了。那是爲什麽呢？因爲杜梨與鴉梨，蜜桃與山桃，種類雖異，支系實近；生理差異不多，所以仍能遷地爲良。至于生理相遠的植物，實在無法使牠們接植。如果思想無大差異，那取人之長，補己之短，並不是一件很難的事業。否則根株大相懸殊，支節移植，殊難成功。拏八股試帖先生扣門磚的精神去研究科學，拏市儈享受利潤的辦法去經營實業，無論他們怎麽的勤勵，歸結仍是南轅而北轍！中學爲體，西學爲用的辦法，無法走通，也就是這簡道理。</p>
<p>第二個階段：大家明白了文化自有個體，自有生活，狂剪亂接，萬無成功的道理，就主張把它連根帶葉，整個地移植過來。近幾年全盤西化的呼聲頗爲有力，正是這個傾向的表示。這樣辨法的好處，就是它的態度是澈底的，不致于鬧出來非牛非馬，成大笑話的東西。植物整株移植，固然要比剪條接枝的辦法比較完善，但是移植的地方，土壤同原來是否是同一的？氣候同原來是否是同一的？……這一類的問題全很關重要。把寒帶的植物移植到熱帶，雖不是不可能的，而事倍功不及半，有許多是大可以不必的。廣東人學西洋人穿皮鞋，鬧出來很特别的脚氣，那並不是因爲他們的皮鞋做的不好，不如歐美人，那是因爲氣候同濕度不同，根本上就不應該模仿歐美人穿皮鞋。再進一歩説，一箇文化的成立各自有其經過的程序。因爲出發點相異，雖欲互相模仿，也是没有辦法。居住泰山東方西方南方北方的人們，逛泰山登日觀峯，看日出的目的雖完全相同，可是因爲他們的出發點不同，他們所經歷的路程很可以性質上即完全相異。北面坡度可以很斗峻，南面坡度可以很平坦。東面可以三里一店，五里一村，食宿一切不成問題；西面卻也未始不可以數十百里略無人烟，不裹糧負幕就有凍餓的危險！東方的人想利用西方的經騐，南方的人想採取北方的辦法，事實是否允許，也實在成問題。老玉米粥裏面的養料不如牛奶，大家很容易承認。但是在人烟稠密，無餘地以發展牧畜的中國，怎麽樣能取得牛奶或牛奶的代用品，豈不是很成問題？歐洲社會事業的發達，是吸收異民族的資産，先繁榮都市而後以餘力繁榮農村。處於半殖民地的我國想發達社會的事業，有什麽法子抄襲歐洲各國的老文章？主張全盤西化的先生們，大部分是醉心於英美的文化，但是我們不能不承認：同英美文化性質差異頗大的俄國文化也是西方重要文化的一支。全盤西化，是模仿英美呢？是模仿法德呢？是模仿蘇俄呢？他們似乎並没有明白地表示。就是有表示，可是，無論英美，法德，蘇俄，他們的環境同中國不同的地方很多，抄襲人家的舊文章，鑿柄的地方也一定不少。此路仍不通行，自是意中事。——如果説有所揀擇，那全盤二字又作何解？</p>
<p>第三個階段：解放了舊有成見的桎梏，也擺脱了任何外來成見束縛。淬厲自有的理性，使它循着它自身的規律儘量地發展。把人類理性經過幾多艱辛，無穩界國界的限制所得收穫：近世精密的科學，無條件地接受下，而又不間斷地努力，使它得以繼長增高。把人類全體的歷史，不管是自己的，人家的，放在同樣的水平綫上，用極客觀的方法，考求這些現象中間因果的關係，以定自己將來的保留與棄置。這樣審愼選擇的結果，將來所保留的，不免是新舊雜　，疏略看起，或與主張中學爲體，西學爲用的辦法相差不遠。但是彼階段的觀點是因仍着社會的惰性定律，理性完全不用事的。此階段的辦法却是完全由理性的主動，經過幾多愼密的工作所獲得的結果。所以二者根本是異質的，不相容的。他們那條件接受近世精密的科學，從外面觀察，也或者頗像全盤西化的主張。但是不管現在的國計民生，儘量要同外人同樣享受的人們，在全盤西化的旗幟下面，總有逃避的地方：他們經過理性或科學太陽的光輝，就要完全冰消雪釋，無處留遺。至於國粹國渣，英美法德蘇俄的劃分，經過旭日的照耀，也就要水乳交融毫無痕迹。這樣無依無靠，任理性單人獨騎，直接進攻的態度是很艱困的，需要長期繼續不斷地努力的。可是，「有九年之病，求三年之艾；苟爲不蓄，終身不得」。其他歧途似近而實遠；循理性的正軌，先崎嶇而後坦途。這樣的階段，我國近數年來的知識界也似乎已經踏着邊際，可是對於自身的意識還未能完全淸楚，所以其他的歧途還不免在各處眩誘。希望大家趕繫認淸路徑，堅實地，勇敢地，毫無猶疑地向前進行，那我國改革的前途也就要走光明和坦平的路上，是毫無疑義的。</p>
<h3>日本物價飛漲人民生活不安</h3>
<p>政黨主張削減預算</p>
<p>馬塲説明財政方針</p>
<p>［東京］此次重開之議會、對於空前之大預算、劈頭將展開其辯論、但政府爲懸念此項大預算之消化與日鈔匯兑管理、於是市塲爲之迷惑、乃促進國內物價之暴漲、竟將現內閣政綱中之安定、國民生活根本推翻、即政黨方面亦對於物價昻貴中之薪俸生活問題、漸次表面化、極爲注目云、（十六日同盟社電）</p>
<p>［東京］今次議會討論之中心問題爲外交·增税電力國營·延長教育期間等問題、政黨方面亦關於此等問題考慮對策、然至最近物價暴騰、國民生活之不安、成爲問題、政友民政兩黨鑒於此事實、主張積極檢討、預算案之意見漸次有力、而發生預算削减之議論、（十六日同輩電）</p>
<p>［東京］馬塲藏相在十五日閣議席上説明、其在議會劈頭演説財政方針內容、請求諒解、其大要如下、</p>
<p>（一）説明預算案、昭和十二年度之預算、置其重點於國防費及實施重要國策之經費、同時在租税及其他方面考慮、增加歳入之方法、以期國運進展、財政强固、因此實行中央與地方税制之整理與刷新、確立地方財政之交布制度、同時對於國民生活之安定、産業貿易之振興等、極爲留意、並充分考慮預算內容、以免成爲所謂偏重預算國防費之跛行的預算、</p>
<p>（二）財政計劃之內容、歳出預算、似不免在今後數年間、繼續膨脹、然由以今次增税與其他計劃發生之本年度收入之增加、及由以國民所得之增加發生之收入自然增加等、可補足歳入之缺乏、今後數年當然不能不發行公債、然國防費减少時期一到、則發行公債數亦自可减少、故决不致有財政基礎之危險、</p>
<p>（三）經濟界之情勢、最近産業貿易之狀態、一路順利進行、然關於貿易有原料品之輸入、及其他事項、在國際收支上、須要考慮之點頗多、於是採用由依求賞主義之貿易政策、改正關税制度、强化匯兑管理法、以期萬無遺憾、（十六日同盟社電）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>多方把持不放近期紗市况稍昂</p>
<p>前途須視實銷為轉移</p>
<p>紗市趨疲、遠期跌風復熾、惟近月多方把持不放、氣勢稍昂、但大阪三品花紗跌風未定、同時現紗銷路呆頓、空方異當活躍、市價乃步步下降、前途究屬如何、須視　需為轉移也、春令布疋旺銷、細紗情形益覺監固、面組紗狀况则甚為衰頺云、</p>
<p>標紗遠期愈拍愈下　標紗前市開盤、近月微見上升、因大戶吸進籌碼不放、市態帶挺、促遠期以三品紗市步步下跌、人心軟化、兼之現紗銷路岑寂、更乏興奮性、故陣容轉復近高遠低之勢矣但塲中交易殊形清淡、標紗結果近月比上日收盤價漲五角、遠漲二·八角午後開盤以上午三品紗收盤仍跌兼之現紗生意不透、多頭出檔、長豊大批賣出、近期市價尚昂、遠期鬆軟愈拍愈下、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌三角至一元二·三角、查賣出錦昌一千一百五十包、明德六百包、賡豐一千包、長豊二千八百包、澄記一千一百包、元一一千六百五十包、福康六百五十包、潤康五百包、買進裕大九百包、聚興六百包、森康一千三百包、愼記七百包、大昌成一千包、益昶一千包、信誠八百包、合興五百包、仁豊四百五十包、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<p>期棉殊少精彩</p>
<p>多空實賣兩難　塲內交易岑寂</p>
<p>棉市疲弱、因海外棉市一律傾向下游人心不振、加之紗市回挫、市况愈見軟化、而現棉廠需亦見停滯、但各路產區售價難以鬆懈多方尚未見十分放棄也、</p>
<p>標花上落亦甚狹小　標花市情異常蕭絮、絕無精彩可言、大有多空兩難之勢但海外印姜棉市一致下落、然市塲未受影響、塲內交易寂寞、上下尤微、結果各月比上日收盤價漲跌五分至一角、午後開盤以紗市回小外棉仍無良好消息、浮多斬結、本月跌破三元關、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一角半至三角半、查賣出長豊六千五百担、豊泰一千五百担、通記三千担、大豊一千担、達記一千担賡豊二千五百担、泰昌一千担、潤康四千四百担、福康二千四百担、源與昌三千六百担、長和一千一百担、買進益康一萬二千九百担元一一千担、澄記一千担、長興一千八百担、裕大一千四百担、錦昌一千二百担泰興一千八百擔、昶記一千七百担、協成二千三百担、生源一千三百担、晋康一千四百担、茲將一日間最高低及收盤個列左、</p>
<p>美棉本月多頭紛紛了結</p>
<p>對政府出售存棉不無戒心</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦市堅、商人對工潮與外國政治情形觀念順利、同行及外國帮買進、價格上漲、惟衆信政府出售存棉、勢將擾亂市面、信任心因此减退、入後一月份多戶因今日為一月份最後交易一日、故紛紛了結、經紀行與外國帮回籠、紐奧令拋賣、價格回跌、然幸同行結價收買、抵抗力尚佳、終以空戶補進、同行頻購市面轉穏、計現貨漲三磅音、期貨跌十磅音至漲三磅音、英棉現貨不動訂貨漲一點、印棉初因大陸商及出口商質進而漲、後因日商及空戶拋售而軟、計平果兩跌一·二五至一·七五羅比、奧姆辣跌一·五至二羅比、白羅溪跌一至一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（十五日電）</p>

<p>天津紗業獲利甚厚</p>
<p>二十五年天津棉紗業獲利豊厚、市價在上半年中、卽呈佳象、細紗每包曾獲利四十餘元、卽如十支粗紗上半年為一百八十八元、下半年竟達二百三十七元、十六支由二百十七元、而達二百七十四元、三十二支由二百七十五元、漲至三百五十五元、四十二支紗價初為三百四十二元、下半年竟達四百十元、其漲風為近數年中所僅見、尤其夏秋間紗廠因花底空盧、暗中减工、市塲需要方殷、而來源反竭、市盤乃益形堅昂、常新花上市之際、人心雖一度虛挫、終因實際銷塲活躍、仍趨上游、復加靑中兩地工潮澎湃、尤為上漲可乘之機、故全年中多戶均大得意、空戶雖脫損失、獲利最鉅者、有占四十餘萬元至獲利三·五萬元者尤衆云、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>棉布商囤藏過年貨</p>
<p>春令布疋交易大旺</p>

<p>呢絨定貨生意特多</p>
<p>呢絨現貨交易、因線結束目近、致逐步减少、祇本街各方隨用隨添之零星辦進、行情因中埠存底不多、市仍挺倘、而洋行定貨生意、非常婦達、如夏秋冬所銷之貨、派力司·花呢·直貢·麥爾登·克羅丁·大衣呢·女色呢·海白龍·平厚呢等、俱有大量定妥、申地英德美波商行、齊有相當定出、日商大豊益記三井岩井玉屋等、亦定交不少、春貨薄花呢、嗶嘰、因不及裝船趕到、故除東貨外、西貨一無定落、海令蓬中厚嗶嘰、因有國貸關係、致同業中訂定者大减云、</p>

<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>黑瓜子漲勢甚勁</p>
<p>本街內地均有動辦　行方亦復起而收進</p>
<p>黑瓜子近以本街內地均有動辦、而行方見存底日薄、復從而收進、兼有新行胃口、故漲勢甚勁、近市幣盤濟魁子已達二十六元六七角、徐州提荘子二十五元半、徐魁子較高之貨二十五元至二十四元半、明光子二十二元至二十一元半、以次亦均隨升、前後漲度已有二三元之多、以存度而論、後市確乎不易回鬆、日防春市尚有一度高漲、預測上式當在卅元之譜、有直上靑雲之概</p>
<p>蘭花子漲二三元</p>
<p>蘭花子近以到貨稀少而銷方頗有需要、故號盤突向上展、較高之貨、比前竟升二三元、號貨隨到隨盤、行存亦已有限後批如有特殊黃亮之貨、尚可加漲、</p>

<h3>確認親子之訴無非金錢作出示</h3>
<p>陸順興店營業發達　出繼之子要求歸宗</p>
<p>南市萬裕碼頭萬裕街一百零九號、開設三開間陸順興機器店、無錫人陸阿四、年六十八歲、期弟三子陸阿六、年三十一歲、於三歲時螟蛉浦東爛泥渡九三弄四十七號唐桂根為子、現繼父母均死、家計因難、而其親生父親則營業發達、蒸蒸日上、雖有兩兄在前、仍思</p>
<p>分一杯羹</p>
<p>乃延周濂澤律師、對親父陸阿四提起確認親子關係、訴訟於地方法院、其原訴稱·原告原為被吿之親生子、彼此委係父子關係、徒以原吿之外祖母與被吿感於迷信江湖課命之說、以原吿之命即俗謂“時辰八字”、與生母陸朱氏相尅、故於原告三歲、生母猶在、由被吿以生父身份、將原告寄名於附近</p>
<p>唐桂根家</p>
<p>幸得唐家之寵愛、始得長大成人、然其間與被吿來往、趨承無間也、上年正月、唐桂根逝世、家道日瀕衰落、而原告又失業、無以為生、迫不得已、乃向被吿及胞兄陸關林、陸根發等、要求給予房屋及工作、以資生活、詎竟遭嚴厲拒絕、幾被毒害、年餘以來、流離顚沛、痛苦非常、而</p>
<p>親血骨肉</p>
<p>之間、竟視同陌路、一若非其所出者然、其實原吿之面貌聲調熊度、在與被告及長兄二兄相酷肖、一經鑑閱、卽可信然、然其對原告竟如是漠視、此其忍心背理、滅棄天倫、已達極點、原吿以長此以在、進退失據、落葉無根、為世俗戮笑、曾託律師去函勸吿不理、為此請判等語、昨日由于推事開庭、陸阿六供訴前情被吿則延吳文濬律師到庭答辯、據被吿云、原告是其親子、於二歲時送給唐桂根之後、</p>
<p>並不往來</p>
<p>我决不承認再行收留此子、况我十三歲時、父母去世、出外學鐵匠店、拉風箱苦工、並作過賣蘆粟小生意、一個人上進、必要做做吃吃、不能貪吃懶做、妄想財產、他已姓唐、且由唐姓為之娶親完婚、而我尚有關林根發兩子等語、原告稱、我是寄名唐姓的、在外邊向用陸姓、且亦常常來往、我二十一歲結婚妻名潘銀珠、生子根福、並一女兒、現因失業、故欲至父親家內歸宗等語、問官核供、廉得其情、以無非金錢作祟、陸阿四亦並非多此一子、恐難以交代家中兩子、故論改期、傳關林根發兩子、到庭訊問意見、再行核奪、</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>皆大歡喜軍校勝信通多二分</h3>
<p>三十一比廿九一球之差</p>
<p>全局比賽形勢緊張非凡</p>
<p>軍校今晨離滬赴蘇</p>
<p>中央軍校籃球隊、在京大敗信通隊、全隊前日來滬答報、昨晚假申園籃球房、與信通作第二次之比賽、復以三十一比二十九分、多二分、再度壓倒信通、上半時軍校以十九比十六超前三分、比賽之五分鐘、賽來緊張異常、信通既作第一次之超出、軍校中鋒王玉增亦於此時以四次犯規罰出、雙方俱現慌亂、卒因軍校球運高照、鮑文沛遠射二次、連中二球、遂反敗爲勝、昨晚因天雨之故、觀衆並不十分擁擠、大約千人以上、軍校全隊、定今晨離滬赴蘇、在滬其他比賽、俱已取消、</p>
<p>軍校球藝</p>
<p>昨晚兩隊表演、在伯仲之間、勝負之分、可謂憑諸幸運、雙方俱有美中不足、傳球之純熟、軍校勝於信通、射籃機會、軍校亦較多不少、惜乎射擲太差、十中僅中其二三、以王玉增言、十數次之近擲遠射、共總祗入網三球、郭震甚佳、鮑文沛毫不能顯其顔色、如果射籃稍有把握、軍校早佔大勝、無待於後來之形勢岌岌緊張也、兩後衛最爲出色、以趙志華較勝於王士選、</p>
<p>信通表演</p>
<p>至於信通方面、亦受有若干障碍、最大者爲塲地之生疏、信通脱離西青熟地、突將塲面放大、於是在西青中之短傳遞、全告失敗、長人萊恩、亦將其功效大减、幾等於零、惟卡遜史規亞别塞爾三人、則仍威風不减、勇猛可怕、信通昨晚之守衛、嚴密非凡、軍校三鋒、不能深入信通籃下者、即此故耳、</p>
<p>一路居先</p>
<p>裁判員張國勛·戴昌齡·鳴笛開賽、軍校先取攻勢、進入籃下、郭震首先一擲、未獲中的、王玉增繼之一托、亦告失的、轉輾相傳、郭震得球飛中、首開紀錄、歡聲大動、卡遜回中一球、王玉增郭震鮑文沛運中三球、軍校以八比二佔先、聲勢甚盛、信通猛烈反攻、軍校始終佔居先着、十三比五、十八比十一、十九比十三、卡遜得中二球、上半時成十九比十六之數、</p>
<h3>軍校之籃球隊</h3>
<p>— （國際社）</p>
<p>信通超出</p>
<p>下半時起信通改取劇烈之功勢、王玉增郭震仍出其不備、相繼中、的成十二三比十六、王玉增於此時被罰第三次之犯規、卡遜得中、軍校受此一大影響後、信通遂乘機進襲、史規亞卡遜、彼此獲中、竟被其追成二十五之平手、軍校之慌張已見顯露、皮塞爾之一球、信通遂作第一次之超出、</p>
<p>最後轉變</p>
<p>全軍中心中將王玉增忽又於此時以四次犯規罰出、幸未被罰中、李甡春入、雙方遂陷入極緊張慌亂之混戰狀態中、此時距終結尚有三分鐘、觀衆之情緒、亦達於沸點、郭震左角遠抛、首先入網、勢成平手、觀者大慰、飽文沛隨手遠射、又進網中、信通再度抬頭、然而萊恩籃下一托、再成平手、軍校鴻運高照、最後之五十秒鐘中、鮑文沛第二次之遠射中的、軍校即憑此球得勝、</p>

<h3>自治</h3>
<p>— 婉文</p>
<p>我今天講的自治，不是地方自治，更縮小範圍的説，個人怎樣自治，因爲地方自治也是由各人能自治而互相帮助造成的，可見個人自治比地方自治重要得多了。</p>
<p>一人是否能自治，在團體中最能顯著的表現出來，團體是多數人組織而成的，如果有人不能自治，就要擾亂秩序，很容易使人注意，因此有損自己的名譽。</p>
<p>小朋友們的生活，大半在學校裏的，學校也是一個團體，所以小朋友的能否自治，在日常生活中也會知道的。</p>
<p>普通同學的自治，可以分三種情形：</p>
<p>第一種人，完全不會自治的，無論在甚麽時候，都要擾亂秩序，像這樣的人，教師要嚴格的教訓才是，因爲到學校中不但是求學，而學做人也是很重要的事，以後這人自會改過自新。</p>
<p>第二種人，在師長面前是很規矩的，可是師長不在，却任意吵鬧，我想這種人比不能完全自治的人更可惡，前者教師還能督促而改過，後者教師並不知道，同學的勸勉，當作耳邊風，反而説人家管閒事，這有甚麽益處呢？希望這班人趕快覺悟了吧！</p>
<p>第三種人能完全自治的，當然值得我們欽佩了，不過還盼望你們帮助他人，雖有時不免要遭譏笑，可是能盡力勸他人改過，也是一件樂事。</p>
<p>這樣，個人方面人人都能自治，地方自治就容易實行，而國家的秩序，也不難永久維持下去了。</p>
<h3>戚繼光的平綏故事</h3>
<p>— 大中丙</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們知道明朝的時候，有一個有名的將官，把倭寇打敗過好幾次嗎？那個有名的將官，名呌戚繼光，號呌元敬，是定遠地方的人，他從小就喜歡看兵書，得了很多的軍事知識，所以壯年時，便做都指揮僉事，到山東去防倭寇，嘉靖三十六年，倭寇擾亂浙邊，繼光奉命調浙，帶兵痛剿，先後九單都勝，捉了二千多個俘虜，殺死的倭寇，不計其數，繼光有了功，升了三級官，過了一年，倭寇又犯長城外，赤峯多倫，漸漸漫延到德化商都等處，於是綏遠告急，繼光又奉命去勦辦，仍大勝，當繼光進百靈廟東南的武川城時，那裏老百姓，宰牛的宰牛，殺豬的殺豬，燒酒的送菜的，街上市上，顯出歡呼的聲音：「戚將軍萬歳，戚家的常勝軍萬歳。」又因紀念他的功績，造了一個平綏臺，把功績刻在平綏臺的石碑上，前後十餘年，安然無事，不料有一個奸官，呌做張鼎思，他説「繼光不宜於北」。當國者就把他調到廣東去了。繼光一生治兵，有兩句重要的話：「號令嚴，賞罰明。」</p>
<p>小朋友們，戚將軍平綏的故事，事過境遷還不到百年，綏遠又遭了賊寇的侵犯，傅作義將軍决心和北方的同志們爲國家守綏遠，誓死也不退一歩，他們在冰天雪地下爲國家打仗，似乎是秉着英勇的戚繼光的遺志一般，但是我們也不能不擔心，以傅將軍一個人的力量，能守得住綏遠嗎？希望全國的小朋友都能節省糖果的錢，捐到綏遠去，這是物質上的援助，同時；大家一條心，恊力守綏遠，不許寸土被敵人奪去。</p>

<h3>前綫一個兵士日記的一頁</h3>
<p>— 玉驥</p>
<p>今天氣温降低了許多，萬物都在銀色世界中，手脚冷得失去了知覺，已不能受自己的支配，可是咱的心，却比往常温暖了好多。現在想到這件事，還覺得喜洋洋的。他媽的！那矮子真没用，被咱抓到後，竟向咱下跪磕頭，還咕嚕咕嚕説些聽不懂的鬼話，看了又好氣，又好笑。老天真枉空給他生成了男子漢。我第一天開到前綫時，還有些胆寒，以爲那些傢伙，總比咱們同胞厲害得多，哈哈！原來是些鬼頭鬼腦的小耗子。</p>
<p>剛才前綫戰得很激烈，咱們伏在戰壕裏，安閒地等待着。看見他們大隊地撲向這邊來，幾排槍發出去，一個個應聲兒倒下來，雪都染成了紅色，看着真够叫老子痛快！</p>
<p>陳長官對我們一隊訓話，説全國各省都熱烈地慰勞我們，常有欵子和寒衣等解到，勉勵弟兄們須格外奮勇殺敵，别以爲收復了百靈廟，已心滿意足，我們還得收復一切所失的土地洗雪一切所受的恥辱，才能甘休。哼！何消説？咱的血早已在沸騰了，從前苦的没機會，現在還不痛痛快快地幹一下，再等何時？也好讓老子出口悶氣。</p>
<p>小五子和他媽，現在不知怎樣？那結壯的婆娘，那天我離家時，她的哭臉也轉變成笑了。媽的！别去想那些撈什子。咱們做了鬼子的奴隸時，還有什麽家？小五子的媽就得給人家佔去做老婆，小五子，這小東西就是不死，也不會再是咱的兒子了。媽的！還是一切都不顧，殺他一個乾净，就是咱丢了命，做鬼也光榮。這次是爲保國土的完整，而我是爲求民族的生存而戰，並不是替長官們爭地盤，就是做了犧牲品，死在戰塲，散了家，可也對得住大中華民國，對得住大中華民國的每個同胞！</p>

<h3>手的影戲</h3>
<p>— 張静霞作</p>
<h3>怒吼吧，中國！</h3>
<p>— 大孩子</p>
<p>親愛的小朋們：</p>
<p>綏遠的戰事發生到現在，已經兩個月多了；在這兩個多月來，前方忠勇將士的努力抗敵，和後方愛國民衆的熱烈援助，已經把那面光榮的，偉大的，民族自救的旗幟高高地揭起來了。民族的火炬已經在每一個民衆手國已擎着，火光照耀遍了全世界，使魍魎遁形，使宵小震驚，使一般强寇不敢妄行肆掠，使鄙視我們的民族亦知尊敬，過去的許多恥辱，我們應該乘此機會來洗滌乾净。</p>
<p>綏遠爲我們國防的最前綫，我們要保全我們的國土，我們要保全我們的主權，我們不願做亡國奴，就不能忽略了綏遠的抗戰；綏遠離開我們雖然很遠，但其痛癢却非常切膚的。所以，我們應當認爲這是關係我們整個國家民族存亡的事情，或許，這就是大戰爭開始的序幕亦未可知；因此，我們希望全國軍民老少一齊起來，共同應付。我們要凖備决心抵抗到底，因爲他們野心不死，詭計多端，綏遠方面若不得逞，説不定遽會從别處再企圖發動的。目前，我們非急速防備不可！</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，我們的中國假使一日不幸而成了朝鮮，台灣，安南，緬甸，的第二，那末你們覺得怎樣？如果這兒都變了東北，你們是東北同胞的話，那是否也會覺得悲哀！現在，我們的國家危急，我們的民族存亡已經到了最後的關頭，我們如若不起來急圖自救，不起來合力抵抗，偉大的中華民國便會有成爲朝鮮，台灣，安南，緬甸第二的危險，我們便會歩東北同胞的後塵。試想，這是多麽可怕的事啊！</p>
<p>我們如今雖然還是一些未成年的小孩子，但對於國家的存亡也應該有點兒關心，救國的責成雖則應讓大人們去負，然而愛國的思想却是要從兒童時代養成的。</p>
<p>看吧！我們民族自救的警鐘已經響遍全世界了。綏遠之戰還是我們的第一下鐘聲吧。——</p>
<p>怒吼吧，中國！我們要從這一角吼起，使全國都怒吼起來</p>
<p>「怒吼着的中國之一角」！我們要從這一角吼起，使全國都怒吼起來！</p>

<h3>中國小朋友給日本小朋友的信</h3>
<p>— 諸逸菊</p>
<p>諸位小朋友：</p>
<p>我們忽然給你們這一封信，你們接到了一定很詫異罷？但是你們别詫異，我們因爲見到現在我們兩國的情形緊張，所以寫這信來，想把我們兩國的小朋友聯絡感情，以促進兩國的國交上，敦睦親善。想你們也願意的罷！</p>
<p>我們常聽得老師講，我們兩國的人民，都是黄種，而且又是同文。以同文同種的人，有仇敵行爲，那不是好的現象！我們應該聯絡和好，和世界上别的種族，共同奮鬥，那麽才顯得我們黄種人，在世界上的地位了。</p>
<p>現在你們的政府，對於我們的政府，重重壓廹；華北一帶，派來大批軍隊，常在演習；上海地方，水兵上陸，耀武揚威，真像大戰要開始了。我們看見了，很是憤慨！這種情形，你們知道麽？這種行爲，你們滿意麽？</p>
<p>我們的小朋友，都是將來兩國的主人翁，負將來兩國的建設和存亡的責任的。所以應相互的督促政府，實行親善。很望你們把這個理由，勸告你們的政府：改變現在壓廹的態度，換上平等互惠的政策，那麽我們真額手相慶了。不知你們以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>專此，敬祝你們健康！</p>

<h3>沙魚</h3>
<p>— 仲美</p>
<p>小敏今天乘功課預備好以後的一些空閒時間，正在翻着一本關於各種大大小小的魚形圖畫，他很小心的一頁一頁看着，但翻到書的最末的一頁，就不懂它是什麽魚類，於是拿着這張圖畫，去問他的哥哥，哥哥答道「這是住在海洋中的一種極兇猛的魚呌沙魚，它的體形是細長有一丈二三尺左右，背面淡灰色而有白色班點裏面生有粒狀的細鱗，鼻部突出，鼻孔和白部都開在身體的下面，這是沙魚的特點，在身體的左右面有鰓孔五對，內部有鰓，在外面却没有鰓蓋，它的脊鰭分前後兩部，前鰭比較後綫大而離開後鰭很遠。」</p>
<p>「沙魚的腹臀兩鰭及胸鰭尾鰭是什甚麽形狀的，生在什麽地位。」</p>
<p>「它的腹臀兩鰭都是極小，生在腹部及臀部的下面。而胸鰭是成三角形的生在五對鰓孔下面，尾鰭形狀，不正上葉很大，下葉很小，呌歪尾。這尾鰭當然是生在尾部的。」</p>
<p>「沙魚的繁殖方法是怎樣的？是不是用卵生方法繁殖的呢？」</p>
<p>「沙魚的繁殖方法不是用卵生方法而是用胎生小魚，胎被胞囊，每産一胞有二尾小沙魚，所以在每年五六月中每次，一共産有十尾左右。」</p>
<p>「那麽沙魚在工業方面或食用方面，有什麽功用呢？」</p>
<p>「沙魚的功用，在王業方面是利用它們的粗糙而堅硬的皮，可以磨光各種器物，在食用方面，那就是將它們的鰭經過一番製造後成爲魚翅，是筵席上的珍貴食品，它們的肉，味道不很佳，但是也可以吃的，它們頭部及鰓部的軟骨，可以製造明骨，也能够供給食用，它們的肝臟可製魚肝油，是强壯我們身體的藥品，而卵因爲富有卵黄，也可作食料用的」</p>

<h3>怎樣籌欵援綏？</h3>
<p>答中山縣李人和</p>
<p>人和弟：</p>
<p>我們很興奮而且愉快地一口氣讀完了你那封滿紙流露着愛國情緒的信，對你提出來的問題，我們决定提早給你答覆。</p>
<p>我們到底應怎樣籌欵援綏呢？這確是每個童子軍在當前最關心的事情。在我們想起來，一個童子軍團裏面，至少有下列幾種方法；</p>
<p>（一）節省日常用費：我們要籌欵，第一先要從自己身上着手，我們應每天把不需要的費用節省下來：倘然你的小隊裏有相當儲蓄，那這不就是提用存欵的時候了嗎？</p>
<p>（二）隨時向外勸募：除了自己的捐欵以外，我們還要隨時勸人家捐欵。祗要有機會，我們應隨時隨地去鼓勵人家援綏。至於捐欵或由你們代收，或由他們交到各地代收處都没有關係，反正我們援綏的目的達到就行了。</p>
<p>（三）變賣作品及珍物：團裏面保存好的成績品，還有我們自己製造的工藝品和自己珍藏的物品（像玩具，珍貴的郵票等），都可以拿來變賣，向熱心人士勸售。我們相信熱心愛國的人一定會給你比成本更高的代價的。這個辦法，我們已經建議給中國童子軍第一七七團實行了。</p>
<p>（四）採集自然物勸售：我們高級課程裏不是有採集自然物的作業嗎？我們現在就可以多多去搜集各種自然物，像美麗的花枝咧，好看的蚌殻咧，精緻的石卵咧，供藥品的野草咧，我們都可以收集起來去賣錢呵。</p>
<p>（五）勸募日用品兜售：我們還可以向各大商店勸募各種日用品和書籍等等，向外界兜售，我們相信熱心的商人一定會贊助你們的。</p>
<p>（六）籌欵游藝表演：你們　可以聯合友團舉行營火大會（現在你們南方還適宜，因爲天氣還不怎樣冷）或游藝大會，推銷門票，以所得援綏。</p>
<p>上面幾點，是我們可以辦的許多辦法中的大部份，我們相信你一定會設計許多更巧妙的方法。不過在進行以前，先要有一個組織，對於進行的歩驟更要好好地商量一下。這裏爲了篇幅關係，不能詳細告訴你。</p>
<p>此外，我們還告訴你一些消息，就是我們最近曾經寫了一封信給中國童子軍總會，提出兩個全國童子軍援綏的總動員計劃。第一我們希望總會令全國各地童子軍統轄機關召集各該地童子軍進行募集當地廢物（像瓶子，舊衣物，破舊用具等），召廢物商拍賣現金貢獻政府。這個我們稱它做全國童子軍搜集廢物援綏動員。第二我們希望總會訂一個日期，令各地童子軍統轄機關籌備營火大會或游藝大會，在指定日期內，全國童子軍　致舉行，集欵援綏。這個我們稱它全國童子軍營火表演援綏動員。我們希望總會能採納我們的意見。你看我們的辦法可行得通嗎？</p>
<p>請了，我們在這裏等待着你們進行援綏的消息！敬祝努力！</p>

<p>伊並没有忘却那兩位一同放逐在西伯利亞的老紳士，他們待伊是再好没有的；伊曾在許多人前提起他們，但是人家往往勸伊不要和伊父親的事情一齊提起，因爲請求太多，恐怕不利於伊的父親，然而不上幾時，伊就得到了消息，説皇帝已發下一道諭旨，特赦伊的父親，並且説皇帝很願意知道柏絲可菲自己可有什麽要求，伊即忙回説小女子受恩深重，不敢再有什麽要求，只希望皇上再行開恩，特赦兩位可憐的老紳士；皇帝見柏絲可菲一些兒没有自私自利之心，更爲感動，查明那兩人所犯的罪，也都是政治性質，早已放逐多年，因此也就降旨一并特赦了。</p>
<p>柏紳可菲爲了伊父親的特赦，表示伊感謝上帝起見，自願捨身去做女修士，而伊的心所向往的，却是那尼希尼地方的女修道院，因爲伊從前害病時，曾在那裏療養的。可是第一歩伊得先到基府去，這是俄羅斯第一個基督教徒，最初受訓的所在。而篤信聖教的皇后聖烏爾珈和毁滅偶像的聖徒佛於狄末兩人的墳墓也在那邊，伊預備前去禮拜一番。柏絲可菲禮拜之後，就在那邊，奉行了出家修道的宣誓禮，像伊那麽一個孝女，没有得到伊的父母的允許，自管去出家修道，大家未免有些奇怪。然而伊在給伊父母進京去請命時，曾暗暗地立過誓，要這樣的報答上帝，如今既已達到了目的，所以伊就實行的還願了。伊從基府回到了尼希尼，希望能够遇見伊的父母，因伊估量這時候兩位老人家就可以從西伯利亞回來了。伊一見了那女修道院的院長，就很懇切地問，有没有二老的消息。院長忙道：「消息很好，快到我房間裏來，我再和你説：」柏絲可菲悄悄地跟着伊走到了會客屋中，早一眼望見伊的父親和母親，站在那裏！他們倆一見了這位勞苦功高的女兒，受了何等的衝動，不知不覺地跪了下來；伊也連忙把雙膝跪下，脱口喊道：「這算什麽？要知這全是上帝帮助我們的，我們應當感謝上帝賜與我們的恩惠。」</p>
<p>勞卜洛夫大佐夫婦倆和伊們的愛女團聚了一個禮拜，暢叙天倫之樂，於是不得不同聲回到故鄉去了。柏絲可菲又在那女修道院中，度伊的餘生，只爲當年長途跋涉，嘗遍了萬苦千辛，竟損傷了伊身體的健康，一天不如一天起來；後來伊雖挨過了幾年的時光，重又見過伊的父母，可是伊的身體衰落得很。曾有一次，伊到彼得堡去，有人看見伊，説伊生着一張美秀的橢圓形的臉，一雙漆黑的眼珠，一個寛廣的頭額，伊的嘴臉帶着一種憂鬱的微笑，可是神情鎭静得很。</p>
<p>一千八百零九年十二月九日，柏絲可菲的病體再也不能支撑下去了。這一天的早上，伊在禮拜堂中，静静的躺在自己的床上，那些女修士們圍在伊的旁邊講着話，眼見伊漸漸地萎靡了。伊們即忙離開了伊，出去祈禱，只留下了一人放聲唱着讚美詩，柏絲可菲却懇求伊不要高唱，因爲那聲擾亂了伊的祈禱。這一夜伊們讓伊躺在那裏，不敢再去驚動伊。第二天早上，却見伊早已長眠過去，兩手交叉在胸前，做成一個十字架的模樣。（完）</p>

<h3>摩洛哥事件的解剖</h3>
<p>— 羅羣</p>
<p>世界形勢是一天天的愈加緊張起來了。雖然一般人所認為國際危機的一九三六年已經過去，但是充滿着火葉氣息的世界仍然表現着牠底動蕩與不寗。就拿西班牙的內戰來說，雖然雙方作戰巳有四五月之久，犧牲的人數亦有好幾十萬，却至今還沒有結束的兆徴•不但不能結束反而，因為各國在這次戰爭中積極的參加，使這次戰爭的內客日益複雜，國際間的影響日益擴大。直到最近，更因為盛傳德軍之開入摩洛哥而演變得更加混亂和嚴重了。</p>
<p>據哈瓦斯九日電稱：“最近十日以來，有大批德國軍隊在西屬摩洛哥美利拉港登陸，當在該港內駐紮，此等德國軍隊均備有全副武裝，且着軍服，另有德國驅逐艦三艘暨潛水艇數艘則停泊美利拉港內，並有德國工程師及工人多名。”同時，路透的倫敦電稱“過去數日中，已有德軍二三百名在西屬摩洛哥各口岸登陸。”此外，倫敦巴黎各報都一再的登出了德軍在西屬摩洛哥登岸並構築防禦工事的消息。雖然柏林方面一再的否認，然而言之聲聲，也恐怕是不無原因的吧。</p>
<p>摩洛哥是北非重要的地方，也是國際間關係　　　複雜的要衝，德軍的侵入不成問題的會立刻引起法國方面的抗議，法國政府已經公開聲明，若德國再派軍隊赴摩洛哥，則法國將考盧軍事行動，而且，國防部長達拉第又有率領參謀人員前往該處親加視察的消息。同時，倫敦巴黎間外交頻繁，德法報紙筆戰劇烈，從各方面的形勢看來，德軍之開入摩洛哥，已成為目前國際間一個嚴重的問題了。</p>
<p>所謂摩洛哥，乃是非洲的一個殖民地，牠位於非洲的西北隅。一九一二年以前本為一獨立的王國，但是因為牠的政治經濟的落後，所以後來變成了列强爭奪的對象，特別是因為牠接近法國和西班牙的疆界，使牠變成了這兩國的鬥爭焦點，一九0二年法意兩國締結秘密協定，法國允許不干預意國佔領特黎波利，而意則不反對法攫取摩洛哥，一九0四年英法兩國又成立了妥協條件，法國允許英國在埃及的行動自由，以取得英國對法國在摩洛哥自由活動的承諾，不久法國又與西班牙訂立條約，劃分了兩國在摩洛哥的勢力範圍；以後雖然德國與法國間為摩洛哥問題曾大起爭執，演成　戰　　動　　時的摩洛哥　問題　侃成後　　於由法國以赤道非洲一部份土地割與德國，而將摩洛哥完全攫取在自己手裏，一九二一年法國宣佈摩洛哥為自己的保護國，遂使摩洛哥變為法國的所有物了。</p>
<p>法國取得摩洛哥後，卽盡力加强牠在此地的統治，如添築防禦工事，加緊對里夫民族的壓抑，主要的是因為這個地方對於法國是非常重要的。第一，牠正常着非洲的西北角上，恰在直布羅陀海峽的南方，對於地中海以至歐亞非三洲的交通上都具有重大的控制作用。第二，牠南部的盆地是駱駝隊集中的地方，也是北西非洲政治交通的要點，在統治整個西非洲上是非常必要的地方。第三，這個地方沿大西洋的許多城市，商業繁盛，物產豐富，氣候溫和，人口衆多，很富於經濟的價值。因為這樣。所以摩洛哥之對於法國，簡直是牠地中海上重要的根據地，是牠統治西非洲殖民地的神經中樞。這個地方，法國無疑是非常重視的。無怪巴黎一聽到德軍侵入的消息，便感到萬分的不安了。</p>
<p>我們知道，自西班牙戰事發動以後，德國便盡量的援助佛朗哥的國民軍。牠的作用，一方面固然想在伊　里　　　　　　　一個性質與牠相類似的國家，以擴大他們的陣營，而在另一方面，也正是牠想利用機會，將自己勢力伸入北非，而在地中海北岸攫取殖民地利益的一種嘗試。常牠剛開始援助西國國民軍時候，國際間便已盛傳佛郞哥已允將摩洛哥權利讓與德國的傳說了。雖然這不一定絕對可信，但是德國之想在北非擭得一部份勢力，却是一個不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>倘若德國在西屬摩洛哥眞的獲得某種軍事的根據地，而且加强了牠底勢力，則地中海直布羅陀海峽的交通勢必受到德國的威脅，而法國在西非的殖民地也將發生一種危機，並且素來稱覇於西地中海的法國勢力也必然會大受影響的。</p>
<p>據路透十日電稱：“法國負責各界謂德人源源侵入非洲西屬摩洛哥境，已引起甚嚴重之局勢，柏林方面否認摩洛哥有德國軍隊存在，益使衆心惶懼，據此間切實聲明，德人在摩之勢力足為法國防務佈置之嚴重危害。”由此，我們當可看出法國方面是如何的惶慮了。</p>
<p>這個事件前途的發展，主要的要看英國的態度來決定，倘若英國堅决與法國站在一條綫上，則德國的行動當可暫時的收束，否則，其前途當會更加趨於混亂。據目前的形勢，英國的態度是有些模稜兩可的。牠一方面為了自己帝國交通的安全當然希望興法國一致，阻止德國向摩洛哥的發展。但另一方面，牠也希望德國軍隊能給佛朗哥以助力，所以在目前，牠還再三聲稱：“德國在摩洛哥之駐兵，尚未達到英國積極干涉之必要程度。”這意思便是說，在目前還不十分要緊。自然，倘若德軍人數再多，其勢力愈加發展，英國是絕不會袖手旁觀的。總之，西部地中海上的風雲，由西班牙戰事的發生，已經表現得非常的動蕩，現在，由於摩洛哥問題，而使這風雲動蕩得更加的緊急了。</p>
<h3>北伐時期的蔣委員長</h3>
<p>— 柳辛</p>
<p>我第一次和這位一百萬軍中的首領“見面是在黃埔軍官學校歡迎中國國民黨第二次全國代表大會代表的盛會上。那天下午，我借各代表由廣州乘小輸抵黃埔軍校，在第四期學生列隊校門外舉槍致敬之中，我雖然感到了我所負荷的黨的使命在我肩上的沈重。同時，我心裹也覺得有幾分驕傲，因為在各代表之中要算我最年輕，雖然就資格而言，我或許是不及他們。</p>
<p>這位兼任軍校校長的“百萬軍中的首領”，這時正站在軍校大廳前候着我們，於是我們就魚貫而入，他也微笑地向我們依次握手。那時我雖然已是一個二十三歲的人了，可是猶渾身未脫黃口小兒的稚氣，不消說，那種鄉土主義的陳舊觀念也同樣的裝滿了一腦袋，就是在現在有時也還是如此。當他和我握手時，我心裹却在作着那樣可鄙的思想：</p>
<p>“蔣校長，我也是一個奉化人呢！”</p>
<p>晚上，在長方形的大廳裹，無數餐桌編排成長長的整齊的四行，足可容二三百人。白色槕布上的瓶花在强烈的電燈光下耀着眼，五塊錢廣東毫洋一客的西餐，正陸續地向各代表的座前輸送。青年軍官們身上的黃色皮帶和代表們襟上的金色徽章，似乎各自在預示着中國前途的遠大和光榮。在每個人堅毅的眼光，沈着的面容，激昂的聲調和果敢的態度中，都隠藏着一種無可抵抗的力量，彷彿這二三百人便是二三百顆炸彈，不久就要分類往各處去爆發似的。</p>
<p>女同志們沉默默地，男同志們活潑潑地。沒有綺麗的歌舞，沒有𣨼人的音樂，也沒有足以擾亂革命空氣的任何事物關入室內，但各人心中却都充滿着狂歡。在運裹，隠士將退避三舍，詩人將摘去花冠，居士將握取屠刀，儒夫將躍然奮志。在這裹，雖有美酒而並不醉人，雖有佳人而並不誘惑，三分的浪漫中帶着七分的莊嚴，小量的悲咽中帶着大量的慷慨。在道裹，羣賢舉至，衆志成城，民族的生命由是滋長，黨國的基礎於以建立。</p>
<p>於是，就在這麼一種非筆墨所能形容的情調之中，那位目光炯炯，容色微黑，高額削臉，戎服草履的蔣校長，微笑地高擎酒杯，勸我們多進一杯酒。酒半酣，倐的一聲霹震樣的“同志們”衛破了代表們嘈雜的語聲，同時我瞥見隔座的一位某軍特別黨部代表某某君，他的握义的左手，似乎很劇烈地震動了一下，是的，蔣校長是在開始作激昂的演說了。</p>
<p>那天他演說的內容是集中於對外和對內的政策問題，措辭簡練而含有刺激性，博得代表們和那些站在大廳外的一羣黃埔學生的鼓掌聲絡繹不絕。往往只說一兩句話，就有一陣轟聲如雷的鼓掌截斷了他的演說。每逢在這樣的時候，他總是把眼光投在餐桌上，以期待這掌聲的止息，同時，這堅决的眼光表示出：他不但能坐而言，而且也能立而行的。</p>
<p>迨軍次南昌，因着客觀情勢的改變，整個一的革命路綫也較前略有不同。在這時期內，我們更可見到蔣氏是一位治軍謹嚴的偉大軍事領袖。所以，每逢總司令部舉行總理紀念週時，我總是不敢坦然地站在前排，怕他在我身上發現了什麼破綻而使我受到責罵。在這一天，我身上的一套草色軍服，也總要穿得比平日更為整齊而潔凈些，每一顆的衣鈕耶扣得很妥貼。頭上的一頂軍帽也戴得很恰當，既不歪斜，又不左右傾，務使黑漆皮的帽簷的地位滴得其所，如同一隻鴨嘴一樣。平常的時候，我老是懶得打綁腿，其實大部分還是為着工作大忙的緣故，腳上的一雙陳嘉庚橡皮鞋（這鞋很便於行軍，有一天我穿着這鞋一日夜跑了一百六十里的遠路，兩腳竟然還沒有走起泡）也不大洗刷，而只是讓灰白色的汚泥安逸地躺在綠色的鞋面上，總要到這一天我纔打起綁腿，而且打得又均勻又結實，同時我還得用一塊板刷把我鞋面上的汚泥一概肅淸。</p>
<p>有一天，又是逢着舉行總理紀念週的那一天，蔣氏在披着紅色的值日帶的值日官拖長的一聲“立……正”裹，登台作軍事政治报告。他先向那些排立在台下參加紀念週的官佐們，自左至右的週視一下，眼睛裹射出一般的軍事領袖所特有的兩道威嚴之光，然後纔開始發言。那天他講的是軍隊紀律問題，他先把那些衛乓痛駡了一頓，說他們站在門首時，常常把兩手縮做一團，簡直連一點兒精神都沒有。驀地裹，他那含怒的眼光，又向前面那些肅然站立的官佐們掃射了一下，像探海燈般的似乎在搜尋着什麼，接着便大聲地發着問題：</p>
<p>“驚衛團團長往那裹去了？為什麼他今天不到會？”空氣頓時緊張起來，像是有什麼嚴重的事快要發住似的。</p>
<p>但沒有回音，大家都是噤若寒蟬，不敢作一聲，於是蔣氏又把那位警衛團團長對著大衆訓斥了一頓。</p>
<p>那天，我恰巧又是站在第一排，他那燃着憤怒之火的眼睛，電光般一閃一閃的，在我眼前是特別的顯明而且可怕；他那暴雷般的聲音，一陣一陣和鉛一樣沉重的打在我的耳鼓上。差不多沒有一個字肯輕易地從我耳中逃避的•固然，他駡的並不是我，但我的確是感到了一陣恐怖——一種在陰天的街上，猝然遇到了狂風暴雨的恐怖。我覺得我好像是站在那裹代人受過的樣子。我可以說，在那次紀念週中，我始終是木然地站着，沒有動一動過，兩隻眼睛兀自怔怔地直對着他的面部，不敢稍作左右視，以表示我全身的注意力正不折不扣的集中在他的演說上面。雖然他在未開始演說之前，已向我們輕輕地而又隨便地喊過一聲似口令而又非口令的口令：“請稍息！”，可是事實上，我却在“立正”的狀熊中，挺胸凸肚的足足挨過了一小時的光景。</p>
<h3>中國南方民族的來源</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>中國的民族大別之雖只分為漢滿蒙回藏五族，但其實不只五種，而且就是每一族中也可分做幾種。比如回族，就可分為熟回，糎回等。然而中國民挨系統最複雜的，除了新疆而外，恐怕就要算兩方各民族了，這裹之所謂南方，係指長江以南，其主要地域為間，粵，雲，貴數省，由量近踾建和廣東語言系統之複雜看來，也可知其民族之衆多了。</p>
<p>中國地方民族，大概分為十幾種：計有荊果，閩粵，客族，蛋族，猺撞，黎族，玀𩁬，苗族，擺夷，西番，以及怒夷，𤞰夷，力些，麼些，民家子，狆人等。現在試略述各族乏來源。</p>
<p>荊族佔據湖北，與苗人有血緣關係。整國也是荊之分支，以現在湖北荊南道姊歸縣為其根據地，後得佔湖北一大半·東周時會與漢族抗衡。其始祖為鬻態•附於荊族的有舒族，詩經上有“荊舒是懲”的話。據今安徵廬鳳一帶，被滅於楚。在春秋時為漢族同化。吳族佔領今之淮泗以南至浙江嘉湖一帶。其開國祖先為周武王之大伯祖泰伯，二伯祖仲痽，他們率領一部分漢族，由陝西南下，過湖北而至江蘇，自稱句吳。</p>
<p>所謂閩越，是句踐之後。閩於春秋末年，附從於越，戰國時附屬於楚。漢高祖封之為閩越王。其後又移居於江淮，與漢人雜處。晋末因為五胡亂華，漢人多南還至閩，而閩地之文化因而大大開通。有人以為閩人係阿利安人之流入，尚仍非定論。廣東為古南越地，粵和越本相通，又叫百粵。至漢朝才受招撫，封趙佗為南越王。漢人大越，最先係在春秋時代，所到地方為番禺。越滅吳和楚滅越時，都有遺民流入。秦始皇開五嶺，發卒四十萬人，後來漢武帝平南越，又幾次徒其民於江淮，這樣一來，粵人之成分，早已與漢族混淆了。</p>
<p>在現在的福建和廣東都有所謂客家，他們都有特別的風俗習慣，但其來源怎樣呢？廣東客族有由北江而來的，有由東江而來的。由北江來的是秦朝遣將甫征，不久秦滅，而將士便貿在今之大慶嶺一帶，漢朝把秦南征之臺侯召人武關，而留慶勝守南疆，所以後名為天廋嶺。相傳當時的兵卒卽今之粵人祖先。東江之客族後於北江。大概一係東晋末年因五胡之亂而南遷，客居於閩南，再因宋末張世傑文天祥之被元人驅逐而至粵南者。其人數現在已遠四百萬人。</p>
<p>所謂蛋族，又叫做蛋戶，這族的人，現在閩粵的河濱與海濱的木船上還有很多。根據各種史籍，得知蛋族係東晋時海盜盧循之後裔，盧循原為漢人，所以蛋族中雜有漢人成分。元初張世傑等领著軍隊十七萬人，民兵三十萬人，淮兵萬人，到粵南崖山，後經元兵追擊，東西分散，流離海上，這也是蛋族來源的一種說法。還有一說，認為蛋族是印度支那半島黑人流徙而至廣東海濱者。總之蛋民是廣東的一種沒有根據地的種族，其來源也可說是多方面的。</p>
<p>猺人的祖先已不可考，大半分布於廣東廣西二省。廣東之猺人又是由廣西來的，原來人口很少。由宋到明增至十幾萬人，住於連山附近山中。廣西猺人最多，舊有“民四蠻六”一語·明代王守仁興乓剿平，始歸服漢族。撞族分希於廣西各地，其中分生熟二種，其事蹟僅見於明末和清初的各種記載，其遠古祖先已不可考。此外還有軬民和畬民兩種，也是猺族的分支·前一種分布於粵之潮州西北部，後一種分布於福建汀州。浙江括倉山也有畬民二十萬人。</p>
<p>瓊崖島上的黎族，現在大多的人都知道。要族中又分黎，歧，侟，數種不同。黎亦有生黎和熟黎二種，居於五指山等處，黎人天性純樓，並不像蠻人。大概是古代漢族遺留於此家。</p>
<p>玀玀也是南方很有名的種族，又叫作猓玀，狫狫，盧盧，獠獠，也叫做蠻子。還有一個“獨立玀玀”的名稱，這是近來西方的民族學者所加的。因為牠不受中國政治勢力所支配，儼然成一獨立刷衆的緣故。其來源，有說是苗族之一種，有說是由西藏，緬甸，交界處移人者。就其習慣風俗考察，前一說法要比較妥當些。𢕽分布的地帶很廣，西至滇邊，南及思茅，東遠貴州，而以四川之建昌為中心。也分生熟二種。熟獨現在大抵已經與謹族同化了。</p>
<p>苗族來源最早，書經上就談到過。苗族名稱非常繁多，其姓氏則有宋家苗，蔡家苗等，以地城分則有八寨，高坡，西溪等，以裝東分則有青，花，白，黑，獨角，短裙等。共分布地帶，紅苗在湖南貴州交界處，以銅仁附近為中必。白苗青苗則分布於貴州中部和雲南金沙江。黑苗一名生苗，分布於黎平，都勻。花苗則在貴陽附近。總之苗族分布以貴州為中心，而及於廣西雲南。</p>
<p>擺夷與老撾人暹羅人同類，是徥前南詔大理國的遺民。現存於雲南之南部。西番為西藏族之交派，居於西唐特別區域，分布於四川西北及川邊。其他怒夷，夷，力些。麼些，民家子都分布於雲南南部，狆人分布於貴州昭通一帶。這都是一些小民族，與玁玀，苗族等相混雜，其來源不易考見。</p>
<p>總括以上各民族的來源來看，大概牠們有兩個來源：一係山古時之所謂中原䢲移而來者，一係山海外䢲移而至者。據世界人種學者所說一，世界人種（指東半球）大概都是發源於高加素及帕米爾這一塊昆連的高原，那麼我國南方各民族，不管來自內地或來自海外，都是發源於一帕米爾高原是不用說的了。同時根據上述，我們又看出各南方土住民族，經歷朝的文化和政治的洗染，已與漢人同化不少，尤其是在最近幾十年。如果能積極地推廣敎育，開發荒野，我想不久各南方民族同漢民族將更無軫域之可言了。</p>
<h3>怎樣度旅行生活</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>照古人說“天地本一逆旅，人生如一過客。”這話用來作愛好旅行者的格言，也是十分恰當的。這樣說來，在旅行生活中首先要注意到的，便是心理的永遠愉悅！如果以為一旰嗟乎，蜀道之難難於上青天！“蹀踐東西，終成溝永“跋涉良苦，行人裹足”，那你何不閉門家中坐，母須來受這不願受的罪了。而且在不實上，這種心理是極端錯誤的！所以，如果打算暢遊甚麼名山大川，奇窟勝境，那必定是要始終保特着一貫的樂觀熊度，堅毅精神。决不可半途而廢，也不可勉强敷衍，弄得意趣衆然—先要存着一種海關天空，閒雲野鶴之想。夢得到處都是家鄉，隨時都感奇趣，從辛苦中體味收獲，從艱難裹探求目的。這是旅行生活過程中矯正心理的第一要義。</p>
<p>心理矯正在目前可說是不大為人所注意了吧？因為交通方便，確是一日千里在進步！既能使人實際享受縮地奇方：又能使人安居飽食，到處適意，往往便會使旅行者自然而然地改變了畏縮恐懼的心理，反而鼓勵了勇氣。但是，在我所經歷和見聞上可又發現了許多遺憾：比仿，有人因為以高岩曲徑著名的廬山，竟有海會寺那一面的上山汽車道，從心理的推測，側面的見解，覺得難見眞面的匡廬，可以不必用芒鞋短褲，只消緩步當車，便可瀏覧一切了。在友人中確有這樣好幾位人太小看了廬山的。他們自已穿了很不利於行走的衣服：女伴們當然是高跟鞋旗袍。到了海會寺，把廬山的重嵐疊嶂隨便看了又看，認為無路可通，不禁掃了很多遊興，有幾個翻一翻遊覧指南，雖看見許多特別的形容詞，但也感不到什麼深趣。抬頭望一望五老女兒諸峯，只覺危岩斷澗，內中諒無坦途可以隨意登臨便也打清了尋幽探奇的勇氣。他也如同香客逛杭州一樣，到過幾十回，也沒有仔細去竄過洞，越過山嶺。除子天竺靈隠六和塔虎跑現成攪在外面的名勝而外，蘊藏在爛熟了的西湖內山外山裹的好去處，他們是無從問津的！所以，在交通方便的目前，在矯正心理以外，還要有獵奇選勝的第二要義。</p>
<p>旅行者也同一個獵人獵狗一樣，走在大路上不要忘記了路旁還藏得有未開關的蹊徑，此中定有未發現的奇蹟在等你欣賞。名勝地不能根據人家的傳說，便人云亦云的去到一到作為業經知悉在案。毋庸再作研討。必順抱定日日新的探究態度，從平淡中自己去獵取奇蹟，從垃圾似的名勝古蹟中去選擇自己心中以為值得鑑賞的東西。為了這種精神的保持，我們便要從旅行心理轉到旅行生理範圍去了。</p>
<p>比如有人要去遊覧四川峨眉山，從山腳到山嶺要走六十里的山路，要換春秋冬三個氣候。如果你對生理方面毫無凖備，則除非不預備繼續旅程，否則勉强撑持必定會影響到身體健康的。還有附帶的一樁事實，也可作為旅行者發鑑的，在六年前，筆者有一個朋友因患肺病往廬山牯嶺調養，本已代為介紹常地友人，照</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>料他上山。但因鳥病人登山心切，沒有等到朋友照料，便自己僱着籐橋上山了。那種籐橋只不過是把一只籐靠椅綁在兩根硬木棍上，未經說昭是病人，橋夫也不種坐轎人的死活，就把這位因患肺病而心臟衰弱的朋友像個籃球一樣，拋了他幾十里路，待拋到牯嶺已弄得氣息奄奄，連忙送到醫院，經醫生一問情由，大為埋怨，連打幾下强心劑都無效騐，不到一星期竟死在山上！這是多麼傷心的事！但向來凡遇病人上廬山，只要預先向橋行申明接洽過，就可避免這種危險，他們預備得有軟橋，轎栝不用硬木質而用長粗竹竿。用被褥紥成臥床似的軟兜，把病人安放在兜裹，並由富於經騐的橋夫很當心地抬着，使病人如同睡搖籃一樣睡到山巔，可以一點不覺得辛苦。這種軟橋在川滇行旅中最為通行，俗稱滑竿。因為川滇行旅成天是在崇山峻嶺中生活，所以非如此安置旅行者不可，尤其是心臟衰弱的人，更必須處處顧到其生理之維護的。</p>
<p>至於旅行携帶應用品方面，當然許多關於旅行的書籍雜誌，以及老於旅行的人都常常在那裹向人昭吿。在我則認為有必需和不必需的。有時，為了求全起見，往往要加重行囊，使探奇選勝的工祚無形中受了拖累，也有時因為遺漏了一項，會使人心理生理上受到無窮的苦痛。我以為除了遠涉重洋而外。多半以登山越嶺為多，奇蹟秀景也多半在深山密林裏，所以對於山行的必需品要特別提出一點來說一說，以作度旅行生活者的借鏡。</p>
<p>爬山决不能穿皮鞋，這是人人知道的。但普通人常用的橡膠底籃球鞋也會常常出事的。因這種鞋底一着水便滑得不得了，踏在泥土上還不要緊，但在爬山行程中常要越過溪澗瀑布等，這鞋底便往往要請牠主人吃盡前仆後跌，甚至生命堪危的痛苦了。我以為如果着得慣草鞋，常然以車鞋為最佳。不過新革鞋會把脚弄起水泡，通常還是以布底平鞋為宜！最好照自己的脚定做。除了鞋子外，用来急救小創傷的藥品那便最要緊了！困為碰破皮膚，轉筋等等，這幾乎是每次旅行中必修的功課。紗布，藥棉，橡皮膏，加意膏，萬金油以及松節油，消毒生膚藥粉，來沙而或　錳養小片等，都得多少預備一些。此外，縫網的針綿也很必要，因為撕破衣服也是常事；而且越撕越大，還是以得小處趕緊縫好為佳。食品也是必需的，“乾糧隨身帶，不怕不自在！”這是旅行者的格言要旨。</p>
<p>其他當然是要靠旅行者自己去隨時體會了。比如說。日記薄等等，發現甚麼便記下來，或者留點字跡在極荒凉的去處等等。總之，能把心理和生理方面解决得適宜。那便是得到旅行生活之味了。</p>

<p>中國的雜誌雖在逐漸的進步，然而像那種摘集各雜誌有價值的文章的雜誌，如readers　Digest那樣的東西，却到如今還沒有。記得兩三年前梁得所先生曾經編輯一種雜誌呌做“文化”，其性質為挑選全國雜誌中的好文章編輯而成，頗有“雜誌之雜誌”的味道：不過當時梁先生的工作僅做到挑選的一步而已：其實；專門挑選是不夠的，我們必得再進一步加以“縮短”。很可喜的，現在已經有“文摘月刊”來担負起這工作了。所以“文摘月刊”的問世無疑是近切地需要的，也是我們中國雜誌界中一椿值得歡欣的事。</p>
<p>雜誌對於一個人固然重要，而雜誌之雜誌對於一般人更為重要。一個雜誌讀者，他的求知慾定是很高的，不過無論他是閱讀能力怎樣高超的讀者，要他去遍覧各雜誌的文章，當然事實上有所不能，而且在他也未必完全需要。雜誌讀者大多數都是“忙人”，他們每天大都有很繁重的工作，祇有在工作之暇去翻閱雜誌，若是要他們在極度疲勞之後，去閱讀一篇長幾千或幾萬字的文章，不但要感到厭倦，而且時間也不允許。如是現在有種雜誌，它能指示全國雜誌中做有價值的文章給他們，並用極短的文字將一篇冗長文字的重要性告訴給他們，那麼這種雜誌是怎樣的適合讀者的需要呀。</p>
<p>實際上，一般大衆，他們無論讀書，讀報，讀雜誌，其目的總在獲取廣泛的知識，並不要作學究樣的凖備。所以一種雜誌能給他們提供出每篇有價值的文章的重要點，使他們閱讀的時間能很經濟的使用，這是他們當前所最迫切需要的。</p>
<p>一般大衆讀者有時會遇到這樣的困難，就是有時他們發現某本雜誌上有一兩篇他們所要讀的文章，而那本雜誌上也僅有這一兩篇他們所要讀的，若是要他們一一的都將它買起來，這在大衆的經濟能力上是很困難的。而“雜誌之雜誌”却恰恰能補救這個困難。</p>
<p>“文摘月刊”的內容和編制都很新穎，計分五大欄：一，一般議論，二，世界政治經濟，三，中，日，蘇的關係，四，中國之過去與現在，五，一般學術。我覺得在目前“文摘月刊能特別注意到中，日，蘇關係及關於中國過去與現在的村料的摘集，是有它的獨特的見地的。</p>
<p>“文摘月刊”摘集的內容很廣泛，很豊富，差不多全國出版的雜誌的文章都摘集在內。它包括社會科學及自然科學兩大部門。社會科學有哲學，社會學，歷史，政治，經濟等，自然科學有工程，物理，化學等。所以“文摘月刊”無異是一隻大溶爐，是雜誌中的圖書館，它包羅萬象，其中不但有嚴正的言論，自然科學的論著，哲學的理論，並且還有輕鬆而有意義的文字，使讀者儘有機會去挑選。</p>
<p>我覺得“文摘月刊對於選擇雜誌文章的標準頗有公正的態度。它卽不是專選著名刊物的文章，也不是專以作者的是否有名為依歸。它所摘集的文字完全是以那篇文章的本身是否有價值為標準。因為有許多不著名的雜誌中常有許多有價值的文章，而許多“不為世重”的作者，他們的作品也確多有值得讀的價值。我想讀過創刊號“文摘”的都會感覺到的吧。</p>
<p>此外“文摘月刊”還有一個特色，就是它所摘集的文章，不論從資本主義的觀點出發，或從社會主義的視角着眼，只要那篇文章的立論有其根據和理由，它都把牠陳列到讀者面前，讓讀者能自動的加以批判而决所取捨。</p>
<p>我因感到“文摘月刊這種雜誌很有其優點，故樂為介紹於讀者之前。自然，創刊號的“文摘”還有不能令人完全滿意的地方，我希望文摘社能“精益求精”地繼續努力下去。</p>

<h3>或人的自白（六）</h3>
<p>— 法國紀德原著　湘士譯</p>
<p>一天早晨，馬西林微笑着進來我對　。</p>
<p>“我給你帶來了一相朋友。”在她身後，果然進來了一個膚色黑赤的小阿拉伯人。他呌做巴西爾，一雙冷靜的大眼睛注視着我。我不知怎麼覺得有些侷促，而這侷促使我厭倦：所以我一語未答，像生了氣似的。那孩子，看見我的冷淡，狼狽了，趕忙轉向馬西林，緊緊靠着她，抓住她的手，吻她露出的臂膊。我盾見在他的白長袍和大披之下，全身是裸赤的。</p>
<p>“來！坐在這兒罷，”馬西林看見我不理睬，便對孩子說：“安安靜靜玩你的好了。”</p>
<p>小孩便坐在地上，從他大披裹拉出一柄小刀，又從帽兜裹掏出一片木頭來，於是就削他的木頭。我猜，他大約要製一管笛。</p>
<p>過了一些時候，我已不因他的來𦣪感到侷促了。我看着他，好像忘記了他在那兒似的。他的脚沒有穿鞋，手腕上的鐲子很好看。他以很巧妙的法子來使用他那柄“蹩脚”小刀。眞的，我對這感到興味了嗎？他的頭髮是照了阿拉伯式剪的，頭上戴了一頂小圓帽，帽頂只有一個小窟窿。他的袍子太寬大了一點，上面顯出他可愛的雙肩，我眞想去摩一摩。我欠起身來，他忙掉轉身來看我。我作手勢呌他把他做的笛子給找，我拿着做出很讚賞的樣子。這時，他要走了。馬西林給他一塊點心，我給他兩毛錢。</p>
<p>第二天，眞是第一次，我感到悵惘；我等待。我等待什麼？我只覺得閒散，不寗。後來，我再也忍不住了：</p>
<p>“巴西爾今晨不來了嗎，馬西林？”</p>
<p>“如果你要他來，我去找罷。”</p>
<p>她留下話，下樓去了。可是過了一會，她仍然是單獨地走回來。疾病把我弄成什要樣子了？我看見沒有巴西爾同她來，幾乎流出了眼淚。</p>
<p>“太遲了，”她此：“學校已經放學，孩子們都散子。可是不要緊，你知道還有很多可愛的孩子，他們都和我熟習的。”（未完）</p>

<h3>Hope for a Peaceful Resolution in the Shaanxi Situation</h3>
<p>Mi Chunlin Flies Back to Beijing from Xi'an, Immediately Reports to Central Authorities; Rumor of Yu Xuezhong's Subordination to Central Government; Yang Hucheng's Troops Still Actively Deployed</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Mi Chunlin returned to Beijing from Shaanxi. There may be a way for the Shaanxi side to repent, and there is still hope for peace. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mi Chunlin flew to Xi'an on the 15th. After conveying the central government's intentions to Yang Hucheng, etc., at 11:45 AM on the 16th, he, along with Yang's representative Li Zhigang and former Beiping Mayor Bao Wenxue, left Shaanxi on a Eurasia Junkers aircraft for Beijing. He then met with Minister He to report on the situation. Li Zhigang then met with President Yu to report. Mi and others are scheduled to go to Shanghai by night train on the 16th. It is said that they will not stay there for long and may go to Shaanxi again. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Tongguan reports that Yang's army is expanding. Large numbers of trains have been departing from Xi'an in recent days, transporting troops to Weinan. As for the trenches in Chishui Town, they are still defended by Liu Duoquan's troops. Yang seems to be using the Northeast Army to cover the deployment of his rear defenses. Many areas in northern Shaanxi are garrisoned by Red Army detachments. It is said that Yang himself is still in the provincial capital. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Confirmed information: the three columns of Red bandits Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Xu Haidong have completely arrived in the counties surrounding Xi'an. Airplanes went to scout, and it has been determined that the redification of Shaanxi is beyond redemption. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Mi Chunlin and Li Zhigang met with Yang Hucheng in Shaanxi, completed the conveyance of the central government's intentions, and took a plane from Xi'an via Zhengzhou to Beijing on the 16th to report to the central government. Also, there are widespread rumors here that Sun Wei would be appointed Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Rumor has it that Yu Xuezhong's troops have news of obeying the central government's orders. The remaining staff in their headquarters office in Xi'an are being monitored by Yang Xiaocheng. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] According to semi-official sources, there is a turning point in the Shaanxi situation. Based on the current situation, if there are no other changes, it will come to an end within days. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Military report: Yang Hucheng is now in a united front with the Red bandits, holding the Northeast Army generals hostage, and actively deploying defenses. The Red bandits are doing their best to entice officers of various armies and young people in the provincial capital, creating a strong atmosphere of terror. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Bao Wenxue, Mi Chunlin, and Li Zhigang, etc., took special Eurasia flights to Xi'an on the previous two days to convey the central government's generous handling of the Shaanxi aftermath and its deep concern for the people of Shaanxi, hoping that Yang Hucheng would consider the central authorities' sincerity for the country and the people, and immediately obey the orders and handle the Shaanxi situation according to the central government's plan. Bao and others have now completed their mission in Xi'an and took the original plane back to Nanjing from Xi'an at 5:00 PM on the 16th. Many people from all walks of life in Beijing came to the airport to welcome them. After Bao and others got off the plane, they shook hands with the welcoming personnel to express their gratitude and then took cars to their residences to rest. It is said that Bao and others are scheduled to visit the central authorities on the evening of the 16th to report on the situation in Xi'an and the latest developments.

<h3>Foreigners in Xi'an Are Safe</h3>
<p>The Government Is Deeply Concerned and Doing Its Best to Find a Solution; Counselor of the US Embassy Flies Back to Beijing from Shaanxi</p>
<p>[Nanjing] US Embassy Counselor Peck flew to Xi'an on the 15th to inspect the situation of American expatriates in Shaanxi. Mr. Peck arrived in Beijing at 5:00 PM on the 16th on the original plane that brought Mi Chunlin and others. American women and children in Xi'an did not travel with Peck. According to Peck's response to reporters at the airport, he met with the expatriates during this trip. The expatriates are currently safe. The evacuation of American expatriates is being considered for a considerable time. Peck spent about twenty hours in Xi'an and did not meet with Yang Hucheng. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Foreign report: There were originally twelve German expatriates in Xi'an. Due to the unfavorable situation in the area for German expatriates, they have successively found ways to leave the country. There are currently no German expatriates in Xi'an. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] All parties are now paying close attention to the protection and repatriation of foreign expatriates in Xi'an. A Central News Agency reporter has learned that as early as mid-December of last year, when the Xi'an Incident first broke out, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had telegraphed Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to do their best to protect foreign expatriates in Shaanxi. With the recent changes in the Shaanxi situation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is maintaining contact with the relevant embassies on the one hand and repeatedly telegraphing Yang Hucheng on the other hand, instructing him to escort the expatriates out of the country. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also consulting with the military authorities on rescue measures, and the military authorities have repeatedly telegraphed Yang Hucheng, instructing him to send the expatriates to Huaxian and guaranteeing that any vehicles transporting the expatriates will be allowed to return to Xi'an. As for the measures proposed by the relevant embassies, all those that can be implemented in practice are being implemented. The dispatch of personnel from the embassies of relevant countries to Luoyang or Xi'an is being given the utmost assistance and convenience at all times and places. For example, when Mr. Peck, Counselor of the US Embassy, flew to Xi'an on an Eurasia aircraft on the 15th, it was with the assistance of the government authorities, and the government personnel on board the aircraft delivered letters on behalf of the embassy. However, the round-trip flights are only possible if the local authorities have been contacted in advance to arrange for parking. In fact, there are inevitably many difficulties. In short, it is still difficult to predict how the Shaanxi situation will develop in the future, but the government will treat all expatriates in Shaanxi equally, with deep concern and doing its best to find a solution to get them out of their current situation. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Peck said that the area where foreign expatriates are concentrated in Xi'an is still safe, but it is best to move out. I originally planned to take a group of women and children out of the country, but because there were not many seats on the plane, I was unable to take them. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mr. Peck, Counselor of the US Embassy, returned here this afternoon from Xi'an on an Eurasia aircraft. In an interview with a Reuters reporter, he stated, "Foreign expatriates in Xi'an are safe. A plan has been drafted to transport expatriates out of the country and will be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for approval." Mr. Peck did not carry any foreign expatriates on this trip because the plane was full of Chinese officials and their families, as well as central government officers residing in Xi'an, with no space left. Among them were Mi Chunlin, former Director of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Li Zhigang, representative of Yang Hucheng, and Bao Wenxue, leader of the Northeast Army. The plane took off from Xi'an at eleven o'clock this morning. The weather was extremely bad, and the pilot had to fly entirely by direction along the way. When it arrived in Beijing at 5:00 PM, it could not descend for a while due to poor visibility. Later, it was able to land safely with the help of signal flares launched by the airport. US Ambassador Johnson, Buxton, Fischer, and Mrs. Peck were all waiting at the airport. After Mr. Peck got off the plane, he replied to a reporter from Reuters, "When I was in Xi'an, I met with all the foreign expatriates. Although they hoped to leave the country, they did not feel despair. Xi'an is still peaceful and there is no chaos. Last night, I was invited to a banquet by Yang Hucheng, but Yang himself did not attend, so I had no opportunity to meet him. The Xi'an authorities are very polite and promised to reserve seats on the plane for foreign expatriates who wish to leave the country. Unfortunately, there were only eleven seats on the entire plane, all of which were occupied by three representatives of Yang and their families, leaving no space for foreign expatriates. When we were about to leave Xi'an, many American and Swedish expatriates gathered at the airport, hoping to hitch a ride, but they were disappointed and returned." (Sixteenth Reuters Electric)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Support the Central Government</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Chen Shuren welcomed Chairman Wang back to Beijing from Shanghai. Speaking to reporters on the 16th, he said that overseas Chinese, in view of the completion of the unification of the motherland and the rapid progress of construction, are more enthusiastic in their support of the central government than before. This can be evidenced by the various facts of overseas Chinese caring about the country. In recent years, our overseas Chinese residing in various countries have also been more respected than before. This is due to the increase in our country's international status. There have been no cases of oppression and expulsion in the past year. This can be reported to the people of the country.

<h3>Xu Yuanquan Hastily Goes to Shinan</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Xu Yuanquan came to Hankou to meet with He Chengjun.

(Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>Gui Yi. Military report: ⑴ A certain party recently ordered 200,000 boxes of gasoline from Tianjin, planning to transport it to Chahar. ⑵ Yu left the puppet troops. There is a rumor that troops from outside the pass will open to Chaoyang North in the Rehe area and push westward. ⑶ After the puppet bandits implemented the reorganization, Wang Ying's troops increased to more than 2,000, Zhang Wanqing's troops increased to more than 1,000, and Li Shouxin's troops also increased. ⑷ The number of puppet bandits in Nanhaogian has greatly increased, with a total of more than 1,000.

<h3>Shaanxi People Eagerly Await Rescue</h3>
<p>[Luoyang] According to visitors from Xi'an, since the Xi'an Incident, all commerce has stopped and the people's food supply is extremely difficult. The general population is eager for the central government to settle the Shaanxi situation as soon as possible and save the people from fire and water. (Sixteenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is said that those who came from Tongguan to Beijing said that soldiers and bandits in Xi'an are indistinguishable, and looting is rampant. The people cannot survive in Changdi due to the ravages of the violent soldiers and have fled to Henan for food. In the counties of western Henan along the Shaanxi border, there are already tens of thousands of refugees from Shaanxi. The Henan Relief Association originally planned to open porridge kitchens to provide relief, but because the number of people was too large and the funds were insufficient, it was decided not to open the porridge kitchens for the time being, as the number of people coming would only increase after the porridge kitchens opened, and it would be impossible to sustain them in the future. For now, local charitable organizations are providing relief as appropriate. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Road news: Traffic to and from Xi'an has been cut off for a long time, and various materials are in short supply, especially food. When Yang defended Xi'an for eight months in the past, each piece of bean cake sold for eighty yuan, and grass roots and tree bark were all gone. The people are still wary and hope that Yang will accept the central government's orders as soon as possible to resolve the Shaanxi situation. (Sixteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Eastern Travel Snippets</h3>
<p>— Lin Gu</p>
<p>㊀ The Delicate New Year of Congratulatory Greetings</p>
<p>Nineteen thirty-six passed bit by bit in a tense atmosphere. As usual, at the end of the year, everything must come to a conclusion, and the achievements of the year must be calculated. Therefore, many innovative people always like to seize the main characteristics of the year and give it a new term. I remember when I was in China, everyone called 1934 the "Magazine Year" and 1935 the "Imitating Ancient Books Year," but some people also thought that 1935 should be called the "Essay Year." What should the just-passed 1936 be called? I still don't know. I think it might still be called the "Magazine Year," which might not be wrong.</p>
<p>People in Tokyo have the same habit. For example, 1935, they called it the "Military Demand Boom Year." In fact, Japan's military demand boom was not only in 1935, but also in 1933 and 1934, but in 1935, it was the "culmination of the boom."</p>
<p>In 1936, some people familiar with the Japanese economic situation still advocated calling it the "Military Demand Boom Year" because the expansion of military demand in the past year was not worse than in 1935. On the contrary, with the active development of international arms competition, it developed further than in 1935. The expansion of military demand caused the steel panic problem and the oil resource problem. The expansion of military industry has reduced the number of farmers in rural areas day by day. Therefore, some people are shouting loudly, "This is Japan's current crisis, farmers should return to the countryside! Reduce the burden on farmers!"</p>
<p>Opening the newspapers for the last day or two of the year, I suddenly found the eight big characters "New Year's Congratulatory Boom Year" on the "Society Page" of each newspaper.</p>
<p>What is called the "New Year's Congratulatory Boom Year"? In other words, the number of New Year's telegrams and New Year's cards sent throughout Japan at the end of 1936 increased by almost double on average. If we only take Tokyo City as an example, then the receipt of New Year's telegrams increased threefold, and the receipt and delivery of New Year's cards increased by 0.9 times. According to the report of the Tokyo Ministry of Communications, the reasons for the sudden increase in New Year's cards and New Year's telegrams are: first, the stimulation of the military demand boom; second, the reduction of telegram fees and the psychological stimulation of the new New Year's postage (a special New Year's rate of 1.5 sen); and third, the effectiveness of the Ministry of Communications' publicity, which is also a manifestation of the upward trend of social culture. However, another part of the people think that this is a manifestation of the downward trend of social culture. It is a micro-expression of the fact that the survival competition between individuals and the phenomenon of infighting between groups are becoming increasingly prominent. Because of the fierce competition and infighting, they have to come up with all kinds of tricks to win over their helpers.</p>
<p>Is it cultural progress or cultural decline? This small incident seems to contain a profound meaning.</p>
<p>㊁ Different Views on Pessimistic Tones</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a unique phenomenon this year. In the process of this booming military demand, the Tokyo newspapers and various magazines with a background in Beiping seem to have unanimously revealed some pessimistic elements. Some say that diplomacy has failed, others that the political situation is uncertain, some say that there is a financial crisis, others that the decline of rural areas is worrying, some support political parties, and others act as cheerleaders for the military. Among them, there are also many people who advocate compromise. With various patterns and different colors, the public opinion circle is really like a place of chaotic and complex ideological struggle. Therefore, in the publishing industry, there is also the elegant name of the "Pamphlet Boom Year."</p>
<p>Let's take an example. In terms of newspapers, the tone of advocating zaibatsu consciousness has been quite strong recently. For example, the Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo, which has the largest circulation, its editorial on the last day of the year is titled "The State of the World Standing Between Light and Darkness." It holds an infinitely pessimistic attitude towards the increase in the burden of national life, the pursuit of empty pleasures, the confusion of the times, the increase in social depression and people's political vigilance, the repeated occurrence of corruption incidents among the backbone elements, and the occurrence of crimes such as parents killing their fathers to defraud insurance money. Its central point seems to be how to relieve the national burden in this extraordinary time.</p>
<p>However, standing from another standpoint—the standpoint of a strong political viewpoint—there are different opinions and different observations.</p>
<p>Let's take the magazine "New Problems" run by young military officers as a representative. In the past year, it once pointed out very angrily: "1936 is a year of chaos, confusion, and dim hope! A social phenomenon at the end of the century! And a year of the development of social culture! In the economic aspect, there is a decisive battle between state-owned and private enterprises. In the social aspect, there is the emergence of the new national movement centered on the right wing camp. However, in the left wing camp, there is also the legal rise of the proletarian forces in the Tokyo Municipal Assembly election last winter. In the cultural aspect, since the February 26th Incident, general important newspapers and magazines have almost completely shifted from the position of guiding society to the position of commercialism. The Asahi Shimbun in Tokyo is an example. Recently, the critical attitude of major magazines and newspapers in Tokyo towards the Japan-Germany Agreement is simply an unprecedented degradation in the history of our country (Japan's) newspapers."</p>
<p>The above is just a summary of the main ideas of the entire magazine. This kind of tit-for-tat argument and these different views interact with each other and roughly show the entire outline of Japanese society to us.</p>
<p>㊂ Five Percent Respect</p>
<p>Recently, Professor Hyoe Ouchi of Tokyo Imperial University said a rather humorous sentence: "Five Percent Respect!"</p>
<p>The so-called "five percent" refers to the increase in the budget of the Ministry of Finance in the twelfth year, which actually reached 1.065 billion yuan, of which the national livelihood stabilization fee was 53 million yuan, accounting for exactly five percent of the total increase.</p>
<p>In this five percent national livelihood stabilization fee, there are a large number of uses such as river improvement, disaster prevention! Such as forestry investment, special subsidies for rural economic regeneration! Such as state-run grain inspection, financial subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses! Such as business subsidies for farmers, mountain and fishing associations! Each sector and each amount is really too numerous to mention!</p>
<p>The common people are always grateful for these subsidies, but the component of gratitude is only five percent!</p>
<p>In addition, Professor Ouchi also listed some statistics, pointing out the living conditions of the general working masses during the five years of extraordinary times. He said: "In the past five years, the livelihood index and income index of the working masses have obviously shown an expanding state of contradiction, that is, on the one hand, the cost of living index has continued to increase, and on the other hand, the real index of wage income has continued to decrease. If we take the cost of living index in November of the sixth year of Showa as 159, then by October of the eleventh year of Showa (i.e., 1936), it will increase to 1839, of which the cost of clothing, etc., will increase by 37%, and the cost of food, etc., will increase by 39%. But what about the actual number of wage income? In the sixth year of Showa, it was still 92.6 (taking the fourth year of Showa as 100), but by the eleventh year of Showa, it had decreased to below 81.6."</p>
<p>In this way, if the opposite trend continues to develop, the lives of the masses are unimaginable. What's more, we saw in the Yomiuri Shimbun on December 29th: "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Doubles Capital Increase in One Fell Swoop"!</p>

<h3>Three Stages of Reform</h3>
<p>— Xu Xusheng</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in a society where most people can live and work in peace and contentment, not only the facts of reform but also the ideas of reform are not easy to occur. When it is difficult for a large part of the people to maintain their livelihoods, the ideas of reform are easily generated and spread rapidly. Subsequently, reform will change from ideas to facts. This kind of major social reform can usually be divided into three attitudes. Because they are often continuous, they can also be said to be the three stages of the reform period. The degree of simplicity and complexity of the social content is different, and the nature of the reform is also different. Therefore, some reforms do not fully complete the three stages, and some, although roughly complete, pass quickly and are not easy to distinguish. The content of my country's reform in the past 100 years is extremely rich, and the slow pace is a very obvious national characteristic of my country. Therefore, these three stages are extremely obvious, and their nature is roughly as described below:</p>
<p>The first stage: The situation of the society at that time is not good, which can be seen by all knowledgeable people. Poverty leads to change, and change leads to success, which can also be felt by most thoughtful people. If there is cultural contact at that time, then taking the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses should also be the overall requirement of those who advocate reform. However, because what was seen at that time was only the surface phenomenon of society, and the fundamental ideas had not been shaken, all these questions, such as what is strength? What is weakness? What is the standard for selection? At that time, they all felt very simple. All that is in line with the main ideas of the past should be accepted; all that is different should be rejected. Acceptance and rejection are all based on the original main ideas. The idea of Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application advocated by the reformers in the late Qing Dynasty was such a method. Such a reform is easily accepted by everyone because the fundamental concepts are not changed at all. However, whether it is successful or not depends on the degree of difference between the culture adopted that day and the old culture. The culture itself, like other organisms, has its own individual and its own life. Grafting is a common thing among plants, but the pear buds must be grafted onto the rootstock of the wild pear, and the peach buds must be grafted onto the rootstock of the mountain peach to thrive and bear good fruit. If it is reversed, the wild pear is grafted onto the mountain peach, and the peach is connected to the wild pear, the grafted buds will definitely wither, let alone bloom and bear fruit. Why is that? Because wild pears and pears, peaches and mountain peaches are different in kind but close in branch. There are not many physiological differences, so they can still be relocated to be good. As for plants that are physiologically far apart, it is really impossible to graft them. If there is no big difference in thought, it is not a difficult task to take the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses. Otherwise, the rootstocks are very different, and the grafting of branches and nodes is difficult to succeed. Studying science with the spirit of the eight-legged essay and the spirit of the market businessman enjoying profits to operate industries, no matter how diligent they are, the result is still going south by driving the chariot north! The method of Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application cannot work, which is also this simple reason.</p>
<p>The second stage: Everyone understands that culture has its own individual and its own life, and that there is no way to succeed in random cutting and grafting, so they advocate transplanting it whole with roots and leaves. In recent years, the call for complete Westernization has been quite strong, which is a manifestation of this trend. The advantage of this method is that its attitude is thorough and it will not create something that is neither cow nor horse, which is a big joke. The transplantation of whole plants is certainly more complete than the method of cutting branches and grafting, but are the soil in the transplanting place the same as the original? Is the climate the same as the original? These kinds of questions are all very important. Transplanting cold-zone plants to the tropics, although not impossible, is less than half as effective, and much of it is unnecessary. The people of Guangdong learn from Westerners to wear leather shoes, which causes a very special athlete's foot. This is not because their leather shoes are not well made and are not as good as Europeans and Americans. It is because the climate and humidity are different, and they should not imitate Europeans and Americans to wear leather shoes at all. Furthermore, the establishment of a culture has its own process. Because the starting points are different, even if they want to imitate each other, there is no way. People living in the east, west, south, and north of Mount Tai have the same purpose in visiting Mount Tai and climbing the Sunrise Peak to watch the sunrise, but because their starting points are different, the routes they take can be completely different in nature. The slope on the north side can be very steep, and the slope on the south side can be very gentle. On the east side, there can be a shop every three miles and a village every five miles, and there is no problem with food and accommodation; on the west side, it is not impossible to have dozens or hundreds of miles with almost no people, and there is a danger of freezing and starving without food. Whether it is allowed in practice for people in the East to use the experience of the West and people in the South to adopt the methods of the North is really a problem. Everyone easily admits that the nutrients in old corn porridge are not as good as milk. But how can China, which is densely populated and has no room to develop animal husbandry, obtain milk or milk substitutes? The development of social undertakings in Europe is to absorb the assets of different ethnic groups, first prosper the cities and then use the surplus power to prosper the rural areas. What methods can my country, which is in a semi-colonial state, copy the old articles of European countries to develop social undertakings? Most of the gentlemen who advocate complete Westernization are fascinated by the culture of Britain and the United States, but we must admit that the Russian culture, which is quite different in nature from the culture of Britain and the United States, is also an important branch of Western culture. Is complete Westernization to imitate Britain and the United States? Is it to imitate France and Germany? Is it to imitate the Soviet Union? They do not seem to have expressed it clearly. Even if there is an expression, there are many differences between their environment and China, whether it is Britain, the United States, France, Germany, or the Soviet Union. There must be many places to chisel a handle by copying other people's old articles. It is a matter of course that this road is still impassable. ——If it is said that there is a choice, then what does the word "complete" mean?</p>
<p>The third stage: It has freed itself from the shackles of old prejudices and also gotten rid of the shackles of any foreign prejudices. It tempers its own reason and allows it to develop as much as possible according to its own laws. It unconditionally accepts the harvest of human reason, which has gone through many hardships without stable national boundaries: the precise science of modern times, and constantly strives to make it continue to grow and increase. It puts the entire history of mankind, whether its own or others', on the same horizontal line, and uses extremely objective methods to study the causal relationship between these phenomena in order to determine its own future retention and abandonment. As a result of such careful selection, what will be retained in the future will inevitably be a mixture of old and new. At first glance, it may not be far from the method of advocating Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application. However, the viewpoint of that stage is to follow the law of social inertia, and reason is not used at all. The method of this stage is completely the result of the active use of reason and careful work. Therefore, the two are fundamentally heterogeneous and incompatible. They unconditionally accept the precise science of modern times, and from the outside, they may look quite like the advocacy of complete Westernization. But those who want to enjoy the same benefits as foreigners as much as possible, regardless of the current national economy and people's livelihood, always have a place to escape under the banner of complete Westernization: they will completely melt away after the radiance of reason or the sun of science, leaving no trace. As for the division of national essence and national dross, Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union, after the sunshine, they will also merge together without any trace. This kind of helpless attitude of letting reason attack directly alone is very difficult and requires long-term continuous effort. However, "if you have a nine-year illness, you should seek mugwort for three years; if you do not save it up, you will never get it in your life." Other detours seem close but are actually far away; following the right path of reason, it is rugged first and then smooth. This stage seems to have been stepped on the edge by my country's intellectual circles in recent years, but they have not been able to completely clarify their own consciousness, so other detours are still inevitable to seduce everywhere. I hope everyone will hurry up and recognize the path, and proceed firmly, bravely, and without hesitation. Then the future of my country's reform will take a bright and flat road, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices in Japan Cause Anxiety in People's Lives</h3>
<p>Political Parties Advocate Budget Cuts</p>
<p>Mabashi Explains Financial Policy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The parliament, which has reopened this time, will launch its debate on the unprecedented large budget at the outset. However, the government is concerned about the digestion of this large budget and the management of the yen exchange rate, so the market is confused, which promotes the sharp rise in domestic prices and completely overturns the stability of national life, which is the foundation of the current cabinet's political program. Even the political parties are gradually paying attention to the salary living problem in the face of high prices. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The central issues to be discussed in this parliament are diplomacy, increased taxes, state-owned electricity, and the extension of the education period. Political parties are also considering countermeasures on these issues. However, recently, the soaring prices and the people's anxiety about life have become a problem. In view of this fact, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties advocate active review, and the opinion on the budget plan is gradually becoming stronger, and a discussion on budget cuts has arisen. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Finance Minister Mabashi explained the content of his financial policy speech to be delivered at the beginning of the parliament at the cabinet meeting on the 15th and requested understanding. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Explanation of the budget plan: The budget for the twelfth year of Showa places its emphasis on national defense expenses and the expenses for implementing important national policies. At the same time, it considers ways to increase revenue in terms of taxes and other aspects in order to promote national progress and strengthen finance. Therefore, it will implement the reorganization and renewal of the central and local tax systems and establish a system for the distribution of local finance. At the same time, it will pay close attention to the stability of national life and the promotion of industry and trade, and will fully consider the content of the budget to avoid becoming a so-called lopsided budget that overemphasizes national defense expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Content of the financial plan: The expenditure budget will inevitably continue to expand in the next few years. However, the increase in revenue generated by this tax increase and other plans this year, and the natural increase in revenue generated by the increase in national income, etc., can make up for the lack of revenue. It is inevitable that government bonds will have to be issued in the next few years. However, once the period of reduced national defense expenses arrives, the number of government bonds issued can also be reduced, so there will never be a danger to the financial foundation.</p>
<p>(3) The situation of the economic world: Recently, the state of industry and trade has been proceeding smoothly. However, regarding trade, there are many points to consider in terms of the import of raw materials and other matters in terms of the balance of international payments. Therefore, it will adopt a trade policy based on seeking reciprocity, revise the tariff system, and strengthen the exchange control law in order to ensure that there are no regrets.

Yesterday, the entire Soviet Union once again listened to Stalin's historical report at the 8th Extraordinary All-Soviet Congress, because the report had been made into a sound film and broadcast on radio stations across the country. Hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, employees, and scientists in factories and collective farms across the country gathered in squares and in front of loudspeakers in apartments to listen carefully to the speech by the author of the new constitution.

<h3>US Navy</h3>
<p>New Battleship Construction</p>
<p>Most Elite in the World</p>
<p>[Washington] Senior naval officials announced today that the two new battleships that the United States is about to build are actually the most well-equipped warships in the world and are completely designed to meet the special needs of the United States. Britain and Japan are both island countries and must rely on their navies to protect maritime traffic and maintain the supply of food. Therefore, the speed of warships is an important condition. But the United States is different. Its navy is nothing more than protecting the first line of national defense. The equipment of the new battleships will be kept strictly secret.

<h3>Spanish Rebels Suffer Setbacks, Germany and Italy Feel Uneasy</h3>
<p>Mussolini and Göring Talk, Seeking a Way to Step Down?</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring continued to discuss the issue of aiding the Spanish Nationalist forces today, and to study ways to expel the Red menace without endangering European peace. (Guomin dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Mussolini and Göring will continue their talks tomorrow and on Sunday. The discussions will largely concern the Spanish Civil War. It is heard that the Italians are quite uneasy about the failure of the Spanish Nationalist forces to advance directly into Madrid. Furthermore, the meeting between Mussolini and Göring will not bring about any changes to the existing political situation. As for the rumors that Göring's visit is intended to get Italy's tacit approval for Germany's invasion of Morocco, this has been denied by both sides. Italy's reply to the British proposal to ban volunteers from entering Spain will likely be submitted next week. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the matter of banning volunteers from going to Spain, the British government recently presented a new proposal to the governments of France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia, asking for their respective replies. It is learned that the Italian government's reply will be ready early next week. It is said that Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring exchanged views on this reply. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Rome] German Aviation Minister General Göring came here for consultations. Yesterday, he held two talks with Prime Minister Mussolini. According to German sources here, the talks yesterday did not result in any concrete decisions regarding the Spanish issue, and Germany does not need Italy to mediate to bring Britain and Germany closer together. Therefore, observers generally believe that the aim of Italy and Germany in forming a united front with Britain is merely to seek a dignified way out, so that Germany and Italy can step down from the hard-line stance they have taken on the situation in Spain. In addition, official sources are keeping silent about the details of the talks between Germany and Italy and are unwilling to comment. The Italian newspapers did not even report on the second talk between Mussolini and Göring yesterday evening. As for the German reporters accompanying Göring, they have all been ordered to minimize the information released regarding the political aspects of Göring's visit. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>Enlisting to Fight in Spain, Valid for Six Months</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the matter of banning volunteers from going to Spain, the Chamber of Deputies today unanimously passed the government's proposed bill with 591 votes to zero. The bill authorizes the government to issue orders at any time within six months to ban the recruitment of volunteers in France or their departure from France to enlist in Spain. Before the Chamber of Deputies voted, Prime Minister Léon Blum attended and gave a brief speech, stating that the British and French governments had repeatedly negotiated jointly with the governments of Germany, Italy, Russia, and Portugal, in order to have each country conclude an agreement to ban volunteers from going to Spain.

<h3>Spanish Rebels Fail to Attack Capital</h3>
<p>Government Forces Advance</p>
<p>Madrid: The National Defense Committee recently issued a communique stating that the rebel forces recently concentrated all their efforts on the area of Arravaca and Las Rozas northwest of Madrid. As of today, government forces have advanced two kilometers in that area. Although the rebel forces have launched fierce attacks on the approaches to Madrid, especially the town of Carabanchel in the southern suburbs and the university area in the western suburbs, they have all been repelled by our forces. Some locations in the university area, which had been captured by the rebel forces for a long time, were recaptured by our forces today. However, there was heavy fog today, so the air force could not take off. In addition, General Miaja, Chairman of the National Defense Committee, told this agency's reporter that there have been no changes in the overall situation today. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>British Secretary of Commerce Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>Will Meet Roosevelt</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's invitation to British Secretary of Commerce Runciman to visit the White House on January 23, the end of the week, has caused much discussion here today, as it is believed that the President may negotiate a British-American trade agreement with him. Runciman arrived in New York on Monday. (Guomin dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to forecasts here today, British Secretary of Commerce Runciman will arrive in Washington next week and will meet with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. Although the authorities have not indicated whether Runciman is under orders to come here for negotiations, it is generally expected that Runciman will conduct informal trade and financial negotiations with the US authorities. The British cabinet is currently using Runciman's trip to learn about the US's attitude towards the above issues. The negotiation of a British-American commercial treaty will be the most complex of all the reciprocal commercial treaties completed by Hull. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>[London] The departure of Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, for the United States next Wednesday is of great interest to political and financial circles here, especially because British Secretary of Commerce Runciman is currently en route to the United States by sea. It is said that both will travel to Washington to discuss revisions to financial policy because the Anglo-French-American monetary agreement has failed to achieve the desired results. The rumor that a tripartite conference will be held in Washington is therefore very strong because French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet is a famous French financial expert.

<p>Gold Production is Especially Abundant</p>
<p>[Manila] Major merchants here all expect this year's Philippine commerce to be excellent. The business community is unanimous in saying that all industries in the Philippines prospered last year. Gold mining is the most prominent feature. According to Mr. Balmaseda, president of the Chamber of Commerce, the prosperity of Philippine commerce in 1936 was one of the most satisfactory years in the history of commerce after the European War. In all twelve months of the year, various businesses were overwhelmed with business. Foreign trade was also one of the best in five years. Currency circulation is increasing daily. Domestic retail sales are soaring. Philippine-produced sugar, tobacco, abaca, etc. are selling well at home and abroad. Government tax revenue is very abundant. Passenger and cargo transportation is very prosperous. Bank lending is more relaxed than before. The most prosperous industry is gold mining. All sectors are investing in it. The amount of gold produced has increased greatly. In the first ten months of 1936, the total value of imports and exports increased by 33% compared to the same period last year. Exports increased by 46.5%. Sugar exports increased by 92%. Imports increased by 18%. Various manufactured goods made significant profits. Retail sales increased by 76%. The construction industry increased by 50%. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>Detroit: According to John L. Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, the temporary solution to the General Motors strike is quite satisfactory. The terms stipulate that the striking workers occupying the factories must withdraw and negotiations for a permanent solution will be conducted. The outcome of the negotiations will inevitably recognize the status of the union. General Motors has also assured the union leaders that after the striking workers withdraw from the factories on Sunday, the two factories that have been closed will not resume work until the strike is resolved. However, the factories that have not been affected by this strike must continue small-scale production. The negotiations will last for two weeks. The above-mentioned temporary solution was decided after four hours of discussion between union leaders and General Motors representatives and then announced by Michigan Governor Murphy. It is heard that Labor Secretary Perkins was also present as an observer during the meeting. Labor and management have agreed to hold negotiations in Detroit and have set Monday to begin. The withdrawal of the striking workers occupying the factories is one of the prerequisites put forward by General Motors, saying that if this illegal conduct is not corrected, there is no need to continue negotiations.

<h3>Northern and Southern Ireland Cannot Unite</h3>
<p>British-Irish Talks Also Difficult to Agree On</p>
<p>[London] An official statement was issued today denying that the talks between Dominion Secretary Malcolm MacDonald and South Irish Free State President de Valera had discussed the unification of Ireland. At the same time, North Irish Prime Minister Viscount Craigavon announced in Belfast that the division of Northern and Southern Ireland was the only way. Thirty-two years ago, Norway split from Sweden. The past is almost entirely forgotten, without a trace. Ulster and Southern Ireland are now halfway through this era. In another sixteen years, both sides will live peacefully under their own governments. The boundary of Ulster must remain as it is today and must not be changed. The official statement on the talks between MacDonald and de Valera said that there are several outstanding issues between the South Irish Free State and Great Britain. The two discussed this time involved the talks. After the talks, a communiqué was issued stating that the discussion was purely informal and did not negotiate all issues. The two exchanged views at the time, so the talks were only an explanation. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Germany Bans Foreign Ships from Navigating the Kiel Canal</h3>
<p>[Berlin] A naval communiqué announced today that foreign warships will no longer be allowed to freely navigate the Kiel Canal. If they wish to pass through the canal, they must first obtain permission from the German government. It has now notified the governments of the countries concerned of this matter. Officials claim that this step is not surprising, as it is actually a natural result of Germany's abandonment of the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that controlled German waterways. According to the treaty, the canal became an international canal after the end of the European War. It is 61 miles long and approximately 29 feet deep. Construction began in 1887 and was opened to navigation in June 1895. However, the entire project was not fully completed until July 1914. The Kiel naval mutiny in the late stages of the war was a precursor to the collapse of the German Empire. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Increases Establishment of Special Service Agencies in China</h3>
<p>Widely Established in Seven Provinces, Work Intensified, Army and Navy Have a Total of Twenty-Two Locations</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the second half of last year, Japanese special service agencies have been established all over the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, and the various banners of Inner Mongolia. As of the current time this year, these special service agencies have gradually developed towards the provinces of Henan and Anhui on both sides of the Yellow River. The recent cracking of the Zhengzhou special service agency is one example. According to what has been heard here, the Japanese special service agencies have all been strengthened and expanded this year. Each agency has three sections: investigation and intelligence, foreign affairs. The number of staff depends on the importance of the location, ranging from fourteen or fifteen to more than twenty. In places such as Pingjin, Beiping, Suiyuan, and Tongzhou, where affairs are complicated, there are also deputy chiefs of special service agencies. The formal staff are all military personnel. There are also so-called temporary agency members, who are mostly employed by seeking suitable candidates for their planned use and paying them special fees. Those who are hired in this way are mostly idle soldiers and politicians. Therefore, it is not known exactly how many people are serving in each special service agency. After the September 18th Incident, diplomacy in North China lost its normal track. The leaders on the Japanese side are mostly special service agencies. Therefore, under the evolution, this kind of military secret work organization that openly operates within the territory has become particularly developed. Eventually, our diplomatic targets also have to treat them as counterparts, gradually becoming a situation under the illegal negotiation and control of the other party. After the rectification of the special service agencies this year, in addition to being directly under the jurisdiction of the military headquarters in the area where they are stationed, they are also closely connected with each other. They strive to transmit news quickly and exchange all information with each other. At the same time, if there are important matters, they are directly telegraphed to the army headquarters in Tokyo. From this, it can be seen that their work is becoming more advanced. The deployment of Japanese special service agencies north of the Yellow River is roughly as follows: A. Belonging to the Kwantung Army: (1) Chief of Puzhou Agency: Lieutenant Colonel Shigeki Hosoki; (2) Chief of Beishi Agency: Major Asano; (3) Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama stationed in Shanhaiguan; (4) Colonel Mutō stationed in Gabusi (former employee Nakajo Yoshichika was dismissed); (5) Major Ueyama stationed in Doron; (6) Major Kuwahara stationed in Zhangbei; (7) Captain Yokota stationed in Ejina Banner; (8) Major Takahashi stationed in Tianjin; (9) Captain Inoue stationed in Pingliang; (10) Captain Kimura stationed in Qinghai. B. Belonging to the North China Garrison Army: (1) Major Shigekawa stationed in Tianjin; (2) Colonel Matsui stationed in Beiping; (3) Major Ueno stationed in Tongzhou; (4) Lieutenant Colonel Kawano stationed in Taiyuan; (5) Major Ishino stationed in Jinan; (6) Major Taniodi stationed in Qingdao; (7) Major Ōmoto stationed in Zhangjiakou; (8) Lieutenant Colonel Hayama stationed in Suiyuan. C. Belonging to the Navy: (1) Colonel Kubota stationed in Tianjin; (2) Lieutenant Colonel Kuwahara stationed in Beiping; (3) Major Sato stationed in Qingdao. D. Belonging to the Puppet Manchukuo: Captain Matsuoka stationed in Tianjin. The above four types of special service agencies number as many as twenty-two. The ones that are planned to be established but have not yet been determined are not counted. A moment of meditation will reveal the intentions of the Japanese side and the impact on our diplomacy, politics, and military.</p>
<h3>Shantou Discovers Suspected White Russian Spies</h3>
<p>Brought Their Own Car from Guangzhou to Shantou  Disguised as Medicine Sellers, Secretly Drawing Maps  Three Individuals Currently Detained in Shantou</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch:  For several days, foreign vagrants have been infiltrating the coastal areas of Chaozhou and Shantou. Recently, these vagrants were replaced by White Russians who have resided in the north for a long time.  They are conducting espionage work to avoid attracting our country's attention. On the morning of the 8th of this month, three White Russians traveled from Guangzhou City in their own car, number 2392, along the first arterial road of the province, passing through Huiyang, Haifeng, Lufeng, Huilai, Puning, Chaoyang, and arriving in Shantou.  They stayed in Room 51 of the Yongping Hotel and wandered around, inquiring about the addresses of military and political organizations.  They even inquired at the 12th Police Precinct about the location of the highest administrative body. The precinct chief immediately sent a policeman to guide them to the municipal government. However, the White Russians suddenly declined the police escort and requested that a young boy be sent instead. This aroused the suspicion of the Second Precinct.  The precinct chief, Chang Wan, subsequently led officers to inspect various inns, preventing criminals from infiltrating during the winter defense period and disturbing local public order.  They learned that the three White Russians were staying at the Yongping Hotel, and the registration card bore the name "Hirao Na."  The police officers immediately entered Room 51 to inspect. The White Russians initially resisted, but the police officers, in order to implement the winter defense martial law, stipulated that all suspicious individuals must be inspected to maintain public order. During the search of the White Russians' luggage, multiple privately drawn maps of the coastal topography of Jieyang, Puning, Liusha, Chaoyang, Huilai, Shantou, and other places were discovered.  After discovering these maps, the precinct chief, considering the seriousness of the suspected international espionage case, telephoned Xiong Xiaji, the chief of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Division, and Wu Zhuoyou, the director of public relations, requesting that they come to the Yongping Hotel to conduct a detailed investigation and determine the truth. According to the White Russians, they came to Shantou in their own car for the purpose of selling medicine along the highway and had no other intentions or missions.  As for the maps they drew, they claimed it was just a casual game. However, their words were hardly credible. Furthermore, among the three individuals, two carried expired passports, and one had no passport at all.  Moreover, the medicines they were selling were not well-known in the market and had not been inspected and registered by the government. Shantou Mayor Huang Bingxun, considering the importance of the matter, personally accompanied Wu Ciyan, the head of the Health Department, and medical officer Li Xi to inspect the medicines.  Moreover, since the White Russians were not doctors or nurses and were selling medicine along the way in their own car while carrying a complete set of medical equipment, this point was indeed highly suspicious. Whether their medicines were related to germ warfare was currently being tested. The three White Russians and their car have been placed under surveillance by detectives, and they are not allowed to move freely. If no other significant circumstances are found, the three White Russians will be deported.  All sectors of society in Chaoshan are paying close attention to this suspected espionage case, as a few years ago, there were rumors of someone poisoning a well.  These three White Russians, posing as medicine sellers, are certainly no ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Issues Wanted Notice for Major Robbery Suspects</h3>
<p>Zhang Shanzheng and his younger brother, Shancheng, residents of three households, third Jia, Sixth Bao, Nantang Township, Eighth District, Punan, live adjacent to each other.

<h3>Suzhou Precinct Police Officer Murdered Late at Night</h3>
<p>At Xingqiaogou, outside Yanmen, at around 10:00 PM on the 15th, a person wearing a gray uniform knocked on the door of the Tongxing rickshaw shop, requesting four jiao in small silver coins. Because it was late at night, there was no response to the knocking. At that time, Li Xinfu, a guard stationed at the third branch of the third precinct of the Public Security Bureau, told the person that it was late and that they could come back tomorrow. This angered the person, who immediately pulled out a kitchen knife and began slashing at the officer's head and other parts of his body. The officer was stabbed more than ten times, severely wounded, and collapsed in a pool of blood. The assailant, realizing the severity of the situation, fled the scene. After the incident was discovered, the officer was rushed to Jin Yong Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Gu, after examination, the officer died at 3:00 PM on the 16th due to excessive blood loss and his life was hopeless. The Public Security Bureau is conducting a thorough investigation to apprehend the perpetrator and file a case for prosecution. Although the cause of the murder is as described above, the Chang Bureau believes that the full details may be more complicated.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Inaugural Meeting</p>
<p>The Suzhou branch of the Rotary Club of China was initiated by foreign residents in Suzhou and prominent social figures such as Huang Shengqing and Duan Yongqing. With the permission of the General Association, the inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 16th) at the Lequn Society in Gongxiang.

<h3>Nanhui Gang of Bandits Attempt to Rob Funds, Injuring Four People</h3>
<p>Du Nanzhu, a farmer in the southeast of Cangzhen, Second District, received more than 300 yuan in society funds the day before yesterday. That night, six or seven bandits broke into his house, tied up his entire family, and threatened him to hand over the money. Because Du refused to comply, he was stabbed by the bandits, injuring four people. Neighbors then sounded the alarm, and the bandits fled. At that time, members of the water security patrol team were patrolling and, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene. They encountered a person who appeared flustered and arrested him. The woman Du identified him as one of the bandits present at the scene. He was taken to the county for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Hosts Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>Wuxi is the most industrially developed region, with numerous silk, yarn, and flour factories. There are many workers. The county government is planning to organize an industrial safety and hygiene exhibition to improve the safety and hygiene equipment of factories. It is scheduled to open next month in the city park. In addition to local exhibits, items will also be transported from the Ministry of Industry. Yesterday (the 16th) morning at 9:00 AM, Zhao Guangting, the Director of the Central Factory Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, came to Wuxi from Shanghai to discuss the matter with Li Shouhuan, the head of the First Section of the County Government.

<p>The county government of this county, in order to rectify tax collection, is organizing a county-wide tax survey, which has now been formally established. The collection of the second installment of land tax for the 25th year has been underway for some time, and the deadline is approaching. All Jia leaders of the relevant tax surveys should earnestly complete the collection in order to maintain the tax regulations. The deadline for the full collection of this installment is divided into two periods, with October 15th as the initial deadline and the 30th as the extended deadline. Yesterday, County Magistrate Long issued an order to all Jia leaders, requiring them to complete the full collection within this period without any excuses for delay. Those who fail to complete the collection will be summoned and forcibly pursued without leniency.</p>
<h3>Another Robbery Occurs in Changshu City</h3>
<p>Recently, robberies have been occurring frequently in this city. The day before yesterday, Yue Hui, posing as a military officer, brazenly brandished a gun and robbed people in the bustling downtown area. The perpetrator is currently being tried by the military division stationed here. Unexpectedly, last night, the home of Li Sunyu at No. 45 Lihai River outside Nandou was also robbed by bandits. There were only three bandits. They first knocked on the door of the Li residence when it was not yet late at night. Zhang Daizhi went out to open the door, and the bandits went straight in. A seemingly knowledgeable person first went to the kitchen to get a kitchen knife and then entered the inner room, demanding that the mistress, Li Xu, hand over the keys. When she initially refused, she was repeatedly slashed in the face with the knife, resulting in four wounds. Her left eye protruded, and her nose was severed, causing her to collapse from severe injuries. The bandits then arbitrarily looted the home, taking a gold bracelet, a gold ring, and more than 1,300 yuan in legal tender. After about half an hour, the bandits packed up and left. Afterwards, the victims reported the incident to the authorities, requesting an investigation, but no one was apprehended. The injured mistress was sent to Jishan Hospital the next morning. Due to her advanced age, she is still in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Conducts General Re-investigation of Opium and Drug Offenders</h3>
<p>The general re-investigation of opium and drug offenders in Wuyi was conducted in the first ten days of this month. A total of 104 individuals were reported by the district, township, Bao, and Zhen chiefs. Eighty-four individuals have already been apprehended, including 72 opium offenders who are repeat offenders, private sellers, or traffickers, and 12 drug offenders. In addition to filling out forms and submitting them to the County Hospital for identification, the county government also prepared a report form yesterday to be submitted to the Civil Affairs Department for filing.</p>
<h3>Muyang Captures Large Number of Traitors</h3>
<p>In the first ten days of this month, the county government received a secret report that many traitors were hiding outside the city, intending to launch a violent uprising. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Qi Lunjie immediately dispatched hundreds of security guards, police officers, and community members to guard the urban areas and conduct a thorough search. In the residence of a traitor named Ye outside the city, more than 20 accomplices and more than 1,000 yuan in legal tender were seized and handed over to the county government for safekeeping. Meanwhile, the districts, townships, Bao, and Jia are continuing the search.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Allocates Funds to Relieve Bandit Disaster</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Disaster Relief Committee has allocated 4,000 yuan each to Taishun and Suichang counties in the border region to relieve the bandit disaster. However, due to the unresolved bandit situation in the area, the funds were delayed for several months. Now, after repeated urging, the distribution has been largely completed. Furthermore, Changhua County was captured by bandits last month, and the homes of the residents in the county seat were burned, resulting in significant losses. The provincial government has decided to allocate 30,000 yuan to the Civil Affairs Department to formulate a distribution plan and send personnel to jointly investigate and distribute the funds to aid the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Putuo Apprehends Suspected Traitor</h3>
<p>Wang Deliao, from Heishan County, Liaoning, arrived at Putuo by boat from the port on the afternoon of the 11th. Upon landing, he immediately unfurled a white cloth flag with the words "Sincerely Vowing, South Sea Jin Qiao" written on it. He was about to enter the Quanqian Temple to worship when he was noticed by someone in the reception hall of the temple, who found his actions suspicious. They questioned him, but his answers were evasive. They sent him to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched officers to inspect his bag and small box. In his blue cloth bag, four small wooden tablets, each less than ten inches wide, were found, seemingly for the purpose of disguise. The bureau sent him to the county government for interrogation, after which he was sent to the Ningbo Garrison Command for further investigation.</p>
<p>Rotting Corpse Found on Hongxing Steamer</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 11th, the new Hongxing steamer of the Daxing Shipping Company, located on the Binjiang Road in this port, sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo. At around 2:00 AM, Wu Songling, a fireman, was collecting coal in the coal bunker when he suddenly discovered a human leg in the pile of coal. He was greatly startled and immediately screamed. His colleagues reported to the first mate, Huang Rongsheng, who dug out the body of a man, about twenty years old, from the coal pile. He was wearing a cotton-padded jacket and trousers, covered by a blue cloth shirt and trousers, and running shoes. The body was rotting, emanating a foul odor, and his face was blurred. The cause of death was likely due to being crushed while secretly hiding in the coal pile. The next morning, after the steamer entered the port, it was reported to the customs, which sent a doctor to examine the body. After confirming that he had been crushed to death, the body was taken ashore after anchoring and reported to the court for examination and a coffin.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Chunli Seeds No Longer a Problem</h3>
<p>The planned amount of spring silkworm seeds for Jiaxing this year, including mountain silkworm and mulberry area changes, is a total of 359,000 sheets. The money has been collected and handed over to the county for transfer. Currently, due to the system of control, only 160,000 sheets have been issued, with a shortage of 100,000 sheets. There will inevitably be disputes when distributing the silkworm tags. Cao Xianzhang and Yu Dajing, representatives from the County Agricultural Association, and Zhu Zhenfan, Yuan Lianpeng, and Chen Jingxian, representatives from the silk cocoon industry, went to the province to petition yesterday. Luo Yinxia, a member of the Provincial Government, met with them and promised to provide a solution to make up the shortage of silkworm seeds. The petitioning representatives requested the number of silkworm seeds be increased.</p>

<p>Poor Environment Causes Flour Market to Decline Steadily</p>
<p>Down More Than 2.5 Jiao in Half a Month  Down 4 Jiao Compared to Highest Price Earlier This Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for all months uniformly plunged. Because the Chicago wheat market report for foreign wheat showed small fluctuations and an uncertain trend, the market price declined due to poor exports. Foreign wheat floating was mostly settled, and the foreign wheat market showed weakness, resulting in a drop of 0.25 to 1.135, while the national currency continued to decline by 0.13. Canadian wheat declined by 0.5 Jiao in the near term and 0.2 Jiao in the long term. Therefore, after the opening price, foreign wheat prices fell continuously, and the market environment became extremely poor again. Most of the outside capital of public companies could no longer support the floating, and they could no longer hold on, so the opening price drop was fierce, dropping 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 fen compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trend had already been established, and the bulls were weak and forced to retreat step by step. The lowest price for this month fell below the 4 yuan mark, with the lowest being 3.57 yuan. February also reached 4 yuan, with a difference of 6 or 7 fen compared to the previous day. This situation was purely due to the fact that the actual sales were inactive, and the floating forces were no match for the actual chips of the manufacturers, so they were naturally killed. There was nothing they could do. In the past half month, the decline in each month has reached 0.25 to 0.27 or 0.8 Jiao. Compared to the highest price earlier this year, it has fallen by almost 4 Jiao.</p>
<p>Hoarding Wheat is Difficult</p>
<p>Continuous Rises Turn Into Steady Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market also saw a consistent and disastrous decline in all months after the market opened in the morning. Because the foreign wheat price continued to ease and decline, and domestic flour sales stagnated invisibly due to the high prices, and because the flour market had already declined, the wheat market price could not but follow suit. Therefore, the opening prices for all months uniformly fell by 0.5, 0.6 fen to 0.1 Jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the actual wheat market also showed an odd easing, and the decline in the flour market worsened, causing the asking price for each month to fall by another 0.3, 0.5, or 0.6. Since last year, prices have risen continuously without any signs of reversal, but the actual situation has now changed significantly. Therefore, those who hoard and speculate are also caught off guard. In the actual wheat market, because the standard has declined again, the asking price has fallen by about 0.1 Jiao. Six yuan, four Jiao, and six fen was opened for Susu and Bengbu wheat. Jiangbei wheat was opened for six yuan, three Jiao, and nine fen, a total of more than 8,000 bags that were processed by various factories.</p>
<p>Sales of Ke Xian Rice Were Not High Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of Ke Xian rice was quiet again. The total number of transactions for the day was less than 1,000 bags, while the Yangtze River source was from 13,000 to 20,000 bags per day. Because Guangdong assistance lacked ships and suspended operations, only Shantou responded to more than 1,000 bags. Xiamen embellished more than 200 bags. This street's transport department was also watching and not moving forward. Hoarders were completely inactive. Only 1,327 bags of Jiangxi rice, 400 bags of Yongyuan rice, and 200 bags of Siam rice were opened in the unified market. The market price was slightly lower than the previous day, ranging from 0.1 Jiao to more than 0.1 Jiao.</p>
<p>Downriver Rice Trading Not Smooth</p>
<p>Hupan Mostly Small, Ranging from a Few Fen to One Jiao</p>
<p>[South Shanghai] Yesterday, there were a total of 40-odd sources from various gangs, totaling 8,700 or 8,800 shi of goods. Among them, thin rice accounted for 24 or 25 sources. The market remained normal and sluggish. The Tianjin Qingyan and other gangs collectively processed 2,500 to 2,600 bags of thin rice. The thin rice market showed no honor or disgrace. The route for thick Japonica rice was more sluggish, and the price varied by a few fen. The market outlook seemed to lack change.</p>
<p>[North Shanghai] Yesterday, there were 16 or 17 sources from various downriver routes. The route to the stomach of various goods in the market was still clear. Middle-grade white Japonica rice hoarders moved slightly, trying to be clever. The market shape was weak, ranging from a few fen to 0.1 Jiao. The price of thin rice was slightly lower, at 6 or 7 fen. The price of early rice was also weaker. The stomach acceptance of Yang Dufu tips was also weak, and the price did not change. The price of change yuan was slightly lower by a few fen. The prices of all other goods were soft.</p>

<p>The Dead End of Silver</p>
<p>India Will Levy Import Tax on Silver Ingots  Roosevelt is Tired of Silver Policy  Silver Prices Will Only Continue to Fall</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - London silver traders expect the last shipment of silver to be loaded onto the Bombay-bound mail ship on February 4, to arrive before the Indian budget is discussed. After this shipment departs, silver prices will continue to fall. It is widely believed that India is the main supporter of the current silver market. However, there are rumors that the Indian government will levy a silver import tax to reduce the budget deficit. Therefore, the Indian silver import rate may not be sustainable. A total of 5 million ounces of silver were shipped to Bombay last week. London's current reserves are only 3 million ounces, the lowest record in the past two or three years. There are also rumors in Washington that President Roosevelt is tired of the silver purchasing plan because the ratio of gold to silver of three to one is difficult to achieve. It is heard that pro-silver legislators will be satisfied if the price of newly mined domestic silver is maintained at 77.75 cents per ounce.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Break the Dull Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange evening market and bond market conditions shifted from dull to bright. The market sentiment was quite firm, and large investors were very enthusiastic about buying. Counter chips tended to be tight again. Many small investors also poured in to hedge and float short. The evening market became lively, and market prices slowly increased. Due to the excitement of people's hearts, there was a promising trend. The long-term opening of the Fuxing public bond was up by one yuan, to 74 yuan. However, those who inquired were still scarce. At the opening yesterday morning, the 115th, etc. were buying quite a bit. Most of the small investors were actively hedging, and the market prices all tended to rise by 5 fen to 0.2 Jiao. Only the Dingzhong long-term was slightly weak by 5 fen. The second round market conditions still showed an increase. The 43rd and 38th, etc. increased their appetite. The 23rd was heavily hedged. The 45th was selling. Wujia, etc. all rose by 5 fen and 0.1 Jiao. The afternoon opening trend showed increasing tightness. The 35th, 11th, and 42nd, etc. increased their appetite.

The comparison of the gains, losses, highs, and lows is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower</h3>
<p>Multiple Parties Holding Firm, Recent Yarn Market Slightly Higher</p>
<p>Future Depends on Actual Sales</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, with the decline in forward contracts rekindled. However, recent months have seen multiple parties holding firm, creating a slightly higher momentum. But the decline in Osaka's Sampin cotton yarn is unsettled, and at the same time, sales of spot yarn are sluggish, with short sellers unusually active. Market prices are therefore decreasing step by step. The future will depend on demand. As spring fabrics sell briskly, the situation for fine yarn is increasingly solid, while the condition of combed yarn is very weak.</p>
<p>Forward Contracts for Marked Yarn Continue to Decline. At the opening of the marked yarn market, near-term contracts saw a slight increase because large players were absorbing chips and holding them firm, supporting the market. This prompted the Sampin yarn market to decline step by step, softening sentiment. In addition, sluggish spot yarn sales lacked excitement, so the market structure shifted back to near-high and far-low. However, trading in the market was unusually thin. The result was that near-term contracts were up five cents from the previous day's close, and far-term contracts were up 2.8 cents. At the afternoon opening, Sampin yarn still fell from the morning close. In addition, spot yarn business was slow, and bulls were selling off. Changfeng sold in large quantities. Near-term prices were still high, but far-term prices softened and continued to decline. The result was that all months fell by 0.3 to 1.23 yuan compared to the morning close. It was found that Jinchang sold 1,150 bales, Mingde 600 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,800 bales, Chengji 1,100 bales, Yuan Yi 1,650 bales, Fukang 650 bales, and Runkang 500 bales. Yuda bought 900 bales, Juxing 600 bales, Senkang 1,300 bales, Shenji 700 bales, Dachangcheng 1,000 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, Xincheng 800 bales, Hexing 500 bales, and Renfeng 450 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Fine Yarn Enters Inland Areas Exclusively. Sales of spot yarn are average, but the domestic trade in fine yarn futures is particularly strong. It was found that a total of 1,156 bales were traded throughout the day. Prices were flat for yarn, up 3 yuan, with the following purchases by various domestic groups:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Lack Excitement</p>
<p>Bulls and Bears Struggle to Sell. Trading in the Market is Sluggish.</p>
<p>The cotton market is weak because overseas cotton markets are uniformly trending downward, dampening sentiment. In addition, the yarn market is retreating, and the market situation is becoming softer. Demand from spot cotton mills has also stagnated, but sellers in various producing areas are reluctant to loosen prices, and bulls have not yet shown signs of giving up.</p>
<p>Price Fluctuations for Marked Cotton are Also Very Narrow. The market situation for marked cotton is unusually quiet, with no excitement at all. Bulls and bears are struggling. However, the overseas Indian Jiang cotton market is uniformly declining, but the market has not been affected. Trading in the market is quiet, and fluctuations are very small. The result was that all months rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, the yarn market rebounded slightly, and there was still no good news from foreign cotton. There were many short covering settlements. This month broke through the 3 yuan mark. The result was that all months fell by 0.15 to 0.35 yuan compared to the morning close. It was found that Changfeng sold 6,500 dan, Fengtai 1,500 dan, Tongji 3,000 dan, Dafeng 1,000 dan, Daji 1,000 dan, Gengfeng 2,500 dan, Taichang 1,000 dan, Runkang 4,400 dan, Fukang 2,400 dan, Yuanyu Chang 3,600 dan, and Changhe 1,100 dan. Yikang bought 12,900 dan, Yuan Yi 1,000 dan, Chengji 1,000 dan, Changxing 1,800 dan, Yuda 1,400 dan, Jinchang 1,200 dan, Taixing 1,800 dan, Changji 1,700 dan, Xiecheng 2,300 dan, Shengyuan 1,300 dan, and Jinkang 1,400 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Many Bulls in the American Cotton Market Are Closing Positions</p>
<p>There is Concern About the Government Selling Stockpiled Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, the Liverpool market was firm. Merchants had a favorable view of labor strikes and foreign political situations. Dealers and foreign groups bought, and prices rose. However, the public believed that the government's sale of stockpiled cotton would disrupt the market, and confidence was reduced. Later, many one-month contracts were closed out because today was the last trading day for January contracts. Brokerages and foreign groups rebalanced. New Orleans was selling, and prices fell back. Fortunately, dealers bought to settle prices, and resistance was still good. Finally, short covering led to frequent purchases by dealers, and the market turned stable. Spot prices rose 3 points, and futures fell 10 points to rise 3 points. British cotton spot prices were unchanged, and orders rose one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by mainland merchants and exporters, but later softened due to selling by Japanese merchants and short sellers. Pingguo fell 1.25 to 1.75 rupees, Oumula fell 1.5 to 2 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 1 to 1.25 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram of the 15th).</p>

<p>The Tianjin Yarn Industry Makes Substantial Profits</p>
<p>In 1936, the Tianjin cotton yarn industry made substantial profits. Market prices were favorable in the first half of the year. Fine yarn earned more than 40 yuan per bale. For example, 10-count coarse yarn was 188 yuan in the first half of the year, but reached 237 yuan in the second half. 16-count yarn rose from 217 yuan to 274 yuan. 32-count yarn rose from 275 yuan to 355 yuan. 42-count yarn initially cost 342 yuan, but reached 410 yuan in the second half. This rise was unprecedented in recent years. Especially between summer and autumn, yarn mills secretly reduced production due to empty cotton reserves. Market demand was strong, but supply was exhausted, and the market became increasingly firm. Although sentiment initially weakened with the launch of Changxin cotton, it ultimately trended upward due to active spot sales. In addition, labor strikes in Qingdao and other places provided opportunities for further increases. Therefore, most players profited greatly throughout the year. Although short sellers suffered losses, the largest profits ranged from 400,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Merchants Stockpiling for the New Year</p>
<p>Trading in Spring Fabrics is Very Brisk</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market has become increasingly relaxed in Shanghai due to the continuous decline in the Sampin yarn market, especially the drop in spot yarn. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill continue to fall by about 0.05 yuan per piece. Native cloth and coarse twill are still sluggish. Shanshang is stable. Heavy coarse cloth has changed due to news of military uniforms being procured. The market situation has changed, and the decline has stopped. All kinds of grey fabrics, such as spring-selling satin, poplin, stripe bleached cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, are being actively prepared. A large amount of futures for February and March have been transacted one after another, resulting in a strong demand for raw materials, such as 42-count, 60-count, and 80-count fine thread. Yarn mills are unable to supply enough, and thread prices are expensive. The spring futures market is increasingly firm. Current goods, such as serge, real thread wool, and dark-colored printed goods, were initially feared to be out of season, and market prices were weakening, but they have now rebounded. Customers from Shandong, Jiangxi, Hankou, Sichuan, and other provinces are increasing their intentions, especially the Chongqing group in Sichuan. Floral goods, such as blue cloth, grey twill, and drill, are also being absorbed in quantities of 300 to 400 pieces. The Ningbo group in Zhejiang is also purchasing coarse cloth, thread wool, serge, and printed goods in quantities of more than 500 pieces, all because the market is firm, and futures are expensive. They are stockpiling for the New Year.</p>
<p>There Are Many Orders for Woolens</p>
<p>Spot trading of woolens has gradually decreased due to the nearing of the end of the line. Only sporadic purchases are being made by various parties on this street for immediate use. Because there are not many stocks in other cities, the market is still firm. However, the order business of foreign firms is very prosperous. A large number of goods sold in summer, autumn, and winter, such as Palace, Flannel, Tricotine, Melton, Gabardine, overcoat wool, women's wool, Habilene, and flat thick wool, have been ordered. Shanghai's British, German, American, and Polish firms have all placed considerable orders. Japanese firms, such as Daifuku, Yiki, Mitsui, Iwai, and Tamaya, have also placed many orders. Spring goods, such as light flannel and serge, have not been delivered in time by ship, so except for Japanese goods, no Western goods have been ordered. Because heavy serge in Hailin involves national loans, orders from colleagues have been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Japanese Rayon Imports Continue</p>
<p>Japanese rayon continues to be imported. Yesterday, the Asama Maru brought 1,500 bales, and today the Seiyo Maru arrived in Shanghai with another 960 bales, scheduled to be unloaded at the Toyo Company pier warehouse (ie, the Mitsubishi warehouse).</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Huizhou White Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended stable. The guild's price was 23.3 yuan for spot 24 coarse sugar, unchanged. Transit goods were 7.85 yuan, with transactions, up 0.05 yuan. Dongyou No. 4 spot was 23.4 yuan, and No. 8 transit goods were 8.1 yuan, both up 0.1 yuan. TM Mark was 7.95 yuan, up 0.05 yuan. There were no other changes. The factory's refined white sugar, Zhenji No. 1, was 22.2 yuan, with the remainder following the retreat. Cantonese groups offered hundreds of packages of Huizhou white, with the Ding Shang Bai character at 21.8 yuan and the Shi character at 21.4 yuan. Because of the rise in coarse white sugar and the scarcity of arrivals, prices rose by 1.6 to 1.7 yuan compared to the previous price. Chaoqing's original price slightly increased. It is heard that although the production price has not risen further, there is no possibility of a loosening in the short term.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Black Melon Seeds Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Both Local and Inland Areas are Active. Dealers are Also Starting to Buy.</p>
<p>Recently, black melon seeds have been actively traded in both local and inland areas. Dealers see that stocks are dwindling and are also buying, in addition to new buyers, so the rise is very strong. The recent market price for Jikui seeds has reached 26.6 to 26.7 yuan, Xuzhou Tizhuang seeds are 25.5 yuan, higher-quality Xuikui seeds are 25 to 24.5 yuan, and Mingguang seeds are 22 to 21.5 yuan. In turn, they have also risen. The increase has already been 2 to 3 yuan. In terms of stock levels, it is indeed difficult for the market to loosen in the future. It is expected that there will be another rise in the spring market, and the estimated price should be in the range of 30 yuan, with a straight upward trend.</p>
<p>Orchid Seeds Rise by 2 to 3 Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, orchid seeds have been scarce and there is considerable demand, so the posted price has suddenly risen. Higher-quality goods have risen by 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous price. Posted goods are sold as soon as they arrive, and dealer stocks are also limited. If there are special yellow and bright goods in the next batch, they may rise further.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>The London Metal Market Shows Signs of Loosening</p>
<p>However, the Copper and Zinc Markets Remain Firm</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from London on the 15th, a large number of profit-taking settlements occurred in the copper, lead, and bismuth markets, and all markets loosened. Rubber opened, and news of progress in the American strike kept prices firm, but they softened slightly. Cocoa was initially firm but ultimately weak. Prices are as follows: Spot copper is selling for 53 pounds, down 0.03125. March futures are selling for 53 pounds, down 0.0375. Lead is 27 pounds 0.06875, down 0.04375. March futures are 27 pounds 0.0625, down 0.04375. Zinc is 22 pounds 0.05625, down 0.0625. March futures are 22 pounds 0.075, down 0.0625. Spot rubber is bid at 10 pounds 0.08125, down 0.0125, and offered at 10 pounds 0.0875, down 0.0125.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from London on the 13th, the copper market opened weak but then turned firm. Although restrictions were lifted, there was not much of an impact. The zinc market was quite firm due to frequent increases in demand from speculators.</p>

<h3>Citizens' Association of the Special District Telegraphed to Request Severe Punishment of Traitors in the Zhengzhou Case</h3>
<p>Order All Provincial, Municipal, and County Governments to Strictly Prevent and Control</p>
<p>File a Serious Protest with Japan and Effectively Stop It</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, the Zhengzhou Japanese ronin conspiracy to riot has aroused national indignation. The 76th, 27th, 38th, and other district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Association of Shanghai jointly sent a letter to the General Association yesterday morning, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Government, ordering all provincial and municipal governments to strictly prevent and control the situation to prevent chaos from breaking out. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, on the 5th of this month, the Zhengzhou First District Commissioner's Office cracked a case of Japanese ronin endangering the Republic of China's institutions at No. 9 Tongshang Lane and arrested the traitor Long Tian and Japanese ronin Shiga, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, etc. After personal interrogation by Commissioner Ruan, it was learned from the traitor Zhao that certain foreign ronin were disturbing and conspiring against our country, colluding with more than 1,000 Liu Guitang bandits lurking in the mountains of Yuxian County, secretly plotting riots, sabotaging transportation, robbing express trains, and arranging for more than 100 ronin to come to Zhengzhou to set up drug sales agencies and take the opportunity to riot. The evidence and witnesses are completely conclusive and deplorable. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese authorities have wantonly invaded our country, conspired to sabotage it, spread rumors, and incited violence, using every means possible. This incident in Zhengzhou fully exposes their ambition for aggression. They are using armed force to threaten us and are also encouraging ronin to lurk in the hinterland and secretly plot sabotage. Their purpose is to annex our country. We request that the Association quickly forward this matter to the Central Government, ordering all provincial and municipal governments to strictly prevent and control the situation to prevent chaos from breaking out, and instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a serious protest and effectively stop it. Traitors who participated in the conspiracy should be severely punished to serve as a warning. This is our earnest plea."</p>

<h3>U.S. Consular Police Arrests Drug Offender</h3>
<p>American Pitt Salt</p>
<p>According to a translation from the Times by an overseas news agency, an American named Pitt Salt was arrested by the U.S. Consular Police for vagrancy and is currently being held in the Ward Road Gaol. He may soon be handed over to the U.S. Court for trial. Prior to the arrest, the U.S. Consular Police had received numerous complaints alleging that he was begging along Nanjing Road and its vicinity. It is said that the suspect is a habitual drug user who has been arrested multiple times on drug charges along the Pacific coast. The U.S. Consular Police in this port received these arrest records from the Washington Crime Investigation Bureau. The reporter immediately investigated the outcome of this case. According to Consul General Fairbanks, the Chinese authorities are rigorously enforcing the anti-drug campaign, and the U.S. Court is willing to cooperate fully in cases involving American nationals. Most of the drug offenders from our country are peddlers who actively encourage people to buy and use drugs to further their trade, posing a major threat to both the morality and economy of society. It is reported that the suspect was arrested on March 5th of the year before last and sentenced to ninety days of imprisonment, which he served at the Xiamen Road Gaol. The sentence was terminated when the suspect left China. At that time, the suspect agreed to be transferred to Manila, but later returned to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>German Cruiser Emden to Arrive in Shanghai on the Second of Next Month</h3>
<p>German Officials and Residents in Shanghai Prepare a Grand Welcome; One-Week Stay Includes Public Tours</p>
<p>To enhance diplomatic relations with China, Germany has dispatched the cruiser "Emden" to visit China. According to news received by German officials and residents in Shanghai, the ship carries a crew of 700 and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the second of next month. It will be berthed between buoys No. 3 and No. 4 off the Gonghexiang Wharf. German officials and residents in Shanghai are preparing a grand welcome and have arranged a schedule: a banquet will be held at the Race Club at 7:30 PM on the 2nd; the Hitler Youth will host a reception at 3:00 PM on the 3rd; the German Amateur Association will stage "America's Luck" at the Lyceum Theatre on the evenings of the 3rd and 4th; the entire crew will take a special train to Suzhou for sightseeing on the 4th and return to Shanghai that evening; German residents will tour the ship on the afternoon of the 4th; German children will visit on the 5th; and a dance will be held at the German Garden Club at 8:00 PM on the evening of the same day. A ball game and dance will be held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. At 9:00 AM on the 7th, the entire crew will attend a service at the German Church to commemorate the fallen soldiers of the European War. At 10:30 AM, there will be a viewing at the Grand Theater. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, there will be a luncheon and sports day at the German Association, with prizes awarded at 5:30 PM. The ship will be open to the public for tours on the afternoon of the 8th. The ship will stay in Shanghai for one week and is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>Another report states that during the European War, the German cruiser Emden escaped from Qingdao and operated in the Indian Ocean for several months, sinking numerous warships and merchant ships, earning a great reputation. Its unpredictable tactics were particularly admired by the naval community. However, it was eventually overtaken by the larger Australian cruiser Sydney near the Cocos Islands. Despite the vast difference in fighting strength, it fought to the death. The ship was riddled with bullets and eventually sank, becoming a heroic and moving page in naval history. The German government later renamed another ship Emden to fill the void. After the armistice, the German government scuttled the warship among the allied countries, and the ship was among them. The German government later named a new ship Emden. The ship is currently circumnavigating the world and will arrive in Shanghai on the morning of February 2nd, staying for a week. The German community in this port is currently preparing a large-scale welcome, with banquets, theatrical performances, dances, and sports competitions. The ship's crew is also scheduled to travel to Suzhou on February 4th by special train and return to Shanghai that evening. The ship will be open to the public for tours on the afternoon of the 8th and is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 9th. The reason why the German community respects the ship is probably because they admire the past heroic achievements of the Emden.</p>

<h3>Sanbei and Hongan Companies Request Approval to Issue Shipping Bonds</h3>
<p>Issuance to Occur After Government Approval</p>
<p>Sanbei Steamboat Company and Hongan Commercial Steamboat Company are the only private shipping companies in our country. Yu Qiaqing serves as the general manager of Sanbei, operating routes in the northern and southern seas and the Yangtze River, with a total of twenty-one ships.

In 1929, the companies issued shipping bonds similar to company bonds, totaling 3.5 million yuan, which have already matured and been fully repaid with interest. Now, Mr. Yu has specially petitioned the Executive Yuan to approve the continued issuance of shipping bonds worth 3.5 million yuan, citing the previous case as precedent. It is reported that the case has been submitted to the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Transportation for review. The two companies will issue the bonds immediately after government approval.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bank Collects Small Station Funds for Two Railways</h3>
<p>The funds for various small stations along the Jin-Hu, Hu-Hang-Yong railways were previously collected to ensure safe and speedy receipt and remittance. In July 1930, the accounting department and the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank entered into a collection agreement. According to the agreement, large stations were to be notified by the bank's branches in each location to send personnel nearby to collect the funds. For small stations, the stationmaster was to pack the funds into sealed bags and hand them over to the train conductor on duty that day for delivery to the cashier's office of the accounting department for verification. The Bank of Communications was then to send personnel to collect the funds and issue a bank draft the next day, which was to be delivered by the accounting department to other banks for deposit into the railway account. It is now known that the railway accounting department recently entered into an agreement with the Shulu branch of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, whereby, in addition to the funds for large stations still being collected by the Bank of Communications, the funds delivered to the accounting department each day will be collected directly by the bank. All funds from the stations along the Jin-Hu railway will be transferred by the bank to the railway account. For the Hu-Hang and Su-Jia railways, the bank will first exchange the funds for bank drafts on the same day and deliver them to the accounting department for delivery to the local banks.</p>
<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (7)</h3>
<p>㊀ Mr. Daoming from Xiangtan asks: 1. Regarding sending money from Xiangtan County to Osaka, Japan, what procedures are required? Can national currency be remitted, and what are the remittance fees? 2. I plan to purchase a hand-operated flour mill from Osaka, measuring 20 inches high and 17 inches wide, weighing four *guan* (approximately 15 kilograms). Can it be directly mailed to Xiangtan, and what would the postage be? 3. Please provide a copy of your publication, "Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A."</p>
<p>Answer: 1. You should obtain two copies of the "International Money Order Application Form" from the local (Xiangtan) post office. Follow the procedures for filling out the 'Domestic Money Order Application Form' as described in the previous Q&amp;A, filling in each item (the amount of Shanghai taels must be specified in Japanese yen, for example, '100 Japanese Yen'). Submit it to the post office exchange staff, who will convert it to national currency according to the prescribed exchange rate and calculate the remittance fee. Then, pay the required amount. For other information and remittance fee rates, please refer to the Postal Regulations and the attached International Money Order Fee Schedule, or inquire at the local post office. 2. This type of hand-operated flour mill can be sent as a parcel directly from the Osaka post office to Xiangtan. However, the weight limit for parcels sent from Japan to China is 10 kilograms per item. If the machine can be disassembled, it can be divided into two or more packages for mailing. The postage for parcels from Japan to China is approximately 1.8 Japanese yen for a 10-kilogram parcel. The size limit is approximately 1.25 meters in length and width. 3. The "Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A" compiled by our company is published serially in major newspapers in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou and is not available as a standalone publication.</p>
<p>㊁ Question: How many types of Simple Life Insurance are there? What is the highest and lowest insurance amount? How is the premium paid, and until when?</p>
<p>Answer: Simple Life Insurance is divided into two types: Whole Life Insurance and Term Life Insurance. The term of Term Life Insurance is divided into four types: ten years, fifteen years, twenty years, and twenty-five years. The insurance amount ranges from 50 to 500 national currency. The premium is paid monthly, and the payment date is based on the date stated on the policy. Payments should be made on time. If a delay is necessary, it must be paid within one month after the due date, and no further extensions are allowed. Otherwise, a late fee will be charged. Premiums can also be prepaid, and if prepaid, preferential treatment can be enjoyed. That is, those who prepay for six months can pay half a month's premium less, and those who prepay for one year can pay one month's premium less. For example, if the premium is two yuan per month, those who prepay for half a year only need to pay eleven yuan, and those who prepay for one year pay twenty-two yuan. Each premium can be paid by the policyholder to the post office insurance window, or the post office can send someone to collect it from the policyholder. This can be indicated in the insurance application form. If the policyholder pays to the post office on time every time and has not been delayed for a full year, he can also pay half a month's premium less. Term Life Insurance premiums are paid until the end of the term or until the death of the insured before the end of the term. Whole Life Insurance is paid until the death of the insured.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Considers Wang Binyan's Hardship</h3>
<p>Requests the Ministry of Finance to Reimburse Advanced Funds - Telegram Replies that Yu et al. Should Negotiate Directly</p>
<p>New Voice Society reports that Wang Binyan suffered hardship due to public service. All circles in Zhabei once formed a support association. Yu Qiaqing and others also acted as mediators, telegraphing to the provincial government to reimburse the advanced funds. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating, "To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of Shanghai and to Mr. Du Yuesheng: Your telegram regarding the military advances by Zhabei Ciyang Qing Jiazi has been noted. We have requested the Ministry of Finance to reimburse the advanced funds. A copy of the original draft is attached for your perusal, and it is hoped that you will contact the Ministry of Finance directly. Chen Guofu, Yang Yin." Also attached is a letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Ministry of Finance stating, "According to telegrams from Yu Hede, Du Yong, Xia Zhen, Chen Qicai, Zhang Yin, Wang Xiaoqi, Lin Kanghou, Shen Yong, etc., when the Su-Zhe War ended and troops retreated, Zhabei was in great disorder. Jiangsu Governor and Superintendent Han telegraphed Wang Dong, the head of the Zhabei Defense Corps, to quickly maintain local order and raise military supplies. At that time, funds were raised in the name of the Zhabei Ciyang Corps. The task was completed in March of the following year, and a register was submitted, showing advanced funds of over 228,000 yuan (interest calculated separately as specified in the contract). The Director of the Jiangsu Finance Office was sent to Shanghai to sign a contract, stating that these large sums of money were specifically for military affairs during the war. Local groups were not obligated to guarantee the above expenses, which should naturally be the responsibility of the central and local officials, and should be repaid in full or equivalent property should be designated as legal compensation. A resolution was passed at a meeting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and it was approved by Director Zeng telegraphically to the Provincial Government. The proceeds from the sale of all land owned by the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau should first be used to repay the advanced funds, with any surplus returned to the state, and any shortfall to be made up. All procedures such as bidding are to be handled by the parties to this contract, and no disposition or use of the proceeds will have legal effect without the consent of the parties. The contract was also copied by Jiangsu Province and sent to the Army and Finance Ministries for review and filing, etc. It has been twelve years, and those who advanced the funds are suffering from the addition of interest and are in extreme hardship. Wang Dong, in particular, has mortgaged his own house to the Cun De Money Shop, the Hong Kong National Bank, and the Guangdong Bank, etc., and has been repeatedly sued. The situation is very serious. The principal and interest amount to 84,000 national currency, and the auction is now being carried out, having been postponed more than ten times. We have repeatedly consulted with Minister of Finance Kong, hoping to prevent Wang Dong from being harmed for his public service and becoming homeless. The government is in a time of economic hardship and may not have time to take care of these factory properties. Other gentry in Yangbei who advanced funds are even greater in number and have already suffered heavy losses and are unable to advance any more. In terms of real estate, the scope is extremely wide and the value is very high. Although it has not been estimated, it is certain that it will be more than enough to repay the debt. Since this money and factory have been reported to the Ministry, it is appropriate for local officials to come forward and take charge. After considering the matter, we should present the details of the matter to Your Excellency. If funds are allocated for relief, we earnestly hope so. If the provincial treasury is temporarily unable to allocate funds, we respectfully request that you consult with the Ministry of Finance to borrow negotiable securities, which Wang Dong can receive to repay the 84,000 yuan for his private property mortgage, so as to have the lawsuit dismissed and save the imminent danger. After Your Excellency sends personnel to Shanghai after the general conclusion to join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to measure and value this factory property for auction, the proceeds will be used to repay the temporarily borrowed Ministry funds and the original commercial mortgages. Any surplus should be recovered by the Provincial Government to settle the outstanding case. If you approve, please send a telegram to facilitate a meeting with Minister Kong to proceed on both sides. The case of Wang Dong being sued and sealed up is imminent, and the situation is extremely urgent. Therefore, we earnestly request that Your Excellency show special consideration and relief to ease the public opinion that is being harmed for public service. There is no other way out, so we urgently submit this request and await your telegram reply with anticipation. Regarding the Su-Zhe War of 1924, when the troops retreated from Zhabei, the Zhabei Charity Group advanced over 220,000 yuan. At that time, the Jiangsu Provincial Military and Civilian officials and the Finance Office signed a contract to repay with all the land of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau. This contract was also copied by the former Jiangsu Military Commander and sent to the former Army and Finance Ministries for review and filing. By nature, this advance was for the use of national troops during the war. The contract stated that it would be repaid with national property and had been reported to the Ministry for record. It should belong to the central government. In fact, Wang Dong, the head of the reading group, has been harmed for public service for more than ten years and should not be ignored. If Jiangsu Province has sufficient financial resources, the provincial treasury should clear it. It is a pity that Jiangsu's finances in recent years have been unusually difficult, which your Ministry is well aware of, and it is really unable to do so. Now, according to the telegram requesting the return of 84,000 yuan to clear Wang Dong's private property mortgage, the language is very urgent. In addition to the telegram reply, we enclose photos of the original contract and respectfully request that your ministry verify and allocate the funds for reimbursement."</p>
<h3>Wang Peide, an Employee of the Shanghai Branch, Is Convicted of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Embezzled More Than 7,000 Yuan - Sentenced to One Year and Two Months of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Peide, a Ningbo native (29 years old), an employee of the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank branch at 1124 East Broadway Road, between June and December 26 of last year, successively embezzled deposits from the Shanghai University of Jiangwan Road, totaling more than 7,500 yuan. After the case was discovered, the Huishan Patrol Division was notified, and Chinese Detective Ma Wenda went to his home at 17 Huade Road, arrested Wang, and escorted him to the First Special District Court. He confessed that he was fooled by his landlord and fellow townsman, Shao Mingshan (broker at Jinkang 70, Gauze Exchange), into privately engaging in speculative cotton yarn trading, resulting in losses. He was ordered to be detained and remanded for further investigation and verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bianfen presided over the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that after investigation, the total amount of money embezzled by the defendant was 7,872 yuan and 54 cents, and the method of embezzlement was: ㊀ Not entering the money handed over by the depositors into the accounts; ㊁ Forging the signatures of depositors on withdrawal slips and secretly withdrawing the money. He claimed at the patrol station that Shao Mingshan, the landlord, instigated him to do so. He was summoned to confront him. Shao claimed that at the time, the defendant was willing to engage in cotton yarn trading and that there were four shareholders. Shao bought and sold on their behalf, sometimes making money and sometimes losing money, etc. Interrogated, the defendant confessed that he regretted being young and weak-willed. At that time, Shao Mingshan told him that the business was quick to make profits, and he was confused and induced by him to resort to this underhanded tactic. He now pleaded with his guarantor and family to find a way to repay the money. If sentenced, what would his old mother and wife do? He immediately broke down, his voice filled with tears, his appearance pitiful, and asked the court to impose a lighter sentence. Judge Xiao sentenced Wang Peide to one year and two months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>The Disastrous Situation in Huangchuan County, Henan Province, is Extremely Severe and Awaits Rescue</h3>
<p>The Manchuan Branch of the World Red Cross Society - Cables the Charity Rescue Association for Relief</p>
<p>The Manchuan Branch of the World Red Cross Society and other organizations telegraphed the United Charity Rescue Association in this city yesterday, stating (titles omitted): "Our Huangchuan is unfortunately beset by frequent disasters. The market is depressed, families are bankrupt, the wealthy have suffered under the red scourge for many years, and the poor farmers have suffered from strange famine for three years. Disease is everywhere, and families crying for food can be seen everywhere. Wildernesses are full of refugees. Moreover, houses are in ruins, and there is nowhere to live. The old and weak will fill the ditches, and the strong will scatter in all directions. At this time, the north wind is blowing hard, and the severe winter is approaching. The lives of these disaster victims depend entirely on relief. This is the reason why our association is holding a winter meeting. However, the association's funds are limited and the relief is not extensive. It is thought that one stream cannot support a large building, and the combined will of the people can form a city. Without the donations of the group, it is difficult to save the countless sufferings. We beg your association to extend your compassion, spread the rain of benevolence, or provide clothing to protect against the cold, or provide food to relieve hunger. If you extend your great compassion and spread your benevolent nectar, so that the disaster-stricken people of Huangchuan can survive this remaining winter, then we will forever be grateful. We weep in desperation and await your orders with utmost urgency. Manchuan Branch of the World Red Cross Society, United Charity Committee of the Buddhist Research Society of Huangchuan County, Henan."</p>

<h3>Three Indians Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Murder</h3>
<p>Attempted to Kill to Silence the Victim - The Previous Case is Concluded</p>
<p>Indians Garam Singh, Sate Singh, and Laitam Singh, on October 22nd of last year, lured a Chinese hotel employee, Hu, to a certain place in Pudong. Garam Singh shot him in the head, but fortunately, the bullet was slightly off course, piercing through his jaw, and he did not die. After the three Indians were arrested, the Court of the British Assessor held several trials. All three defendants denied being in Pudong that day, but there was no conclusive evidence. At the final hearing a few days ago, Assessor Jones announced the end of the debate and asked the jurors to retire to the back of the court to decide whether they were guilty. The jurors deliberated for a moment and then returned to the court, declaring that the defendants were guilty. Therefore, Jones sentenced the three defendants to life imprisonment. According to Hu, one of the three defendants confessed to him that he had shot and killed the Sikh watchman Bishan in June, and then feared that he would spread the news, so they tried to kill him to silence him. According to the investigation by the patrol station, the bullet that killed Bishan was indeed the same as the one that wounded Hu. Therefore, the final verdict in this case concludes the previous case.</p>
<h3>Chen Boliang's Testicle Was Injured and Protruded</h3>
<p>The Injury is Extremely Severe and His Life is in Danger - The Cause of the Attack May Be a Love Affair</p>
<p>Chen Boliang, a 32-year-old native of Ningbo, wearing a dark gray line spring lambskin robe, a dark blue striped cotton-flannel long gown, a black satin melon-skin cap, and black velvet shoes, was hired to hire a rickshaw at 4 AM yesterday from Dadongmen in the city, traveling near Qiaojiabang Road inside Dananmen. The municipal police Xiao Binlin saw that he was suspicious, and when he questioned him, his answers were irrelevant. Upon closer inspection of his robe and crotch, fresh blood was flowing, and he was in too much pain to speak. It was obvious that he had been attacked by an enemy. He ordered the rickshaw to the police station immediately. He gave his name as Chen Dong, a peddler, with no wife or address. He had a seal with the inscription "Chen Liangqiao Seal" in his possession, but his words were incoherent, and he seemed to have a mental illness. He was sent to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment by the police in the same rickshaw. It was discovered that the left testicle of Chen's lower body had been protruded, having been stabbed with a knife, about three centimeters long. However, due to excessive bleeding, the injury was extremely serious, and his life was in danger. As of late at night, no family members had arrived at the hospital to take responsibility. As for the reason for the attack, it is inevitable that there was a love affair, and the police station is secretly investigating.</p>

<h3>Ma Changshou, the Assassin in the Yin Bingen Case, Apprehended</h3>
<p>Arrested in the Natural Bathhouse - Awaiting Transfer to Court for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Yin Bingen, a native of Anhui who previously served as a patrolman, was assassinated on the night of October 11th of last year in front of No. 168 Wujia Lane, Qianjiatang, in the French Concession. The French Patrol Department arrested the murderers, Wang Dianhua (also known as Wang Laowu) and Wu Weicai, both from Anhui, and prosecuted them in the Second Special District Court. According to their confessions, Ma Changshou and Wang Kaifu, who had also escaped, also killed Yin. However, after Wang was transferred to the detention center, he suddenly retracted his confession. After investigation and interrogation of the witnesses, a date was set for sentencing. Subsequently, Wang, the presiding judge in the case, in order to thoroughly clarify the case and ensure that no one was wronged or let off, announced the annulment of the conclusion of the debate and set a date for reopening the debate. As noted in this newspaper at 3 PM yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the Second Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought for re-trial. According to the report of the detectives handling the Chu case, Ma Changshou, the accomplice in the defendant Wang Dianhua's previous confession, could not be found. It is now known that Ma is a native of Hefei and fled to Shanghai after committing theft in Hefei. At 1 PM on the 10th of this month, the Hefei County Government sent police to Shanghai to join the patrol officers of the Yulin Road Patrol Station in the Public Concession to arrest Ma Changshou in the Natural Bathhouse at No. 910 Pingliang Road. He is currently detained in the First Special District Court, requesting a postponement to bring Ma to court for questioning. After verifying the report, the court ordered a postponement to the 23rd to transfer Ma Changshou to the court for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Zhang Hengyan Was Splashed With Acid - The Reason for the Grudge Was the Picked-Up Leather Suitcase</h3>
<p>Disputes Over Sharing Reward Money and Recommending Business Are Complex - Shen Xisheng Denies Being in Anhui</p>
<p>Zhang Hengyan, a 30-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 36 Sanxin Lane, Ailai Ge Road, French Concession, was splashed with nitric acid while passing the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Caishi Street in the French Concession at around 9 PM on August 5 of last year. He was seriously injured, and the assailant fled. Zhang went to the French Patrol Department to seek medical treatment at Renji Hospital. The Patrol Department ordered the arrest of the assailant. While Zhang was being treated in the hospital, his injuries slightly improved. He claimed that the assailant was Shen Xisheng, a local he knew. The Patrol Department reported to the court and obtained an arrest warrant. On December 3rd of last year, Shen Xisheng (27 years old, Shanghai native, residing at No. 94 Weier Meng Road) was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. Because the victim had not fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital, the defendant was ordered to be detained and a date was set for a later hearing after the victim recovered from his injuries. As reported in the previous newspaper, yesterday morning, the Second Special Court's Chen Shuoying brought the case to the First Criminal Court for further hearing. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case and prosecuted the defendant for assault. According to the victim Zhang Hengyan, after being injured, he stayed in the hospital for 161 days and was only discharged today. At around 9 PM on August 5th of last year, while passing the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Caishi Street, he heard someone shout, "It's him! It's him!" The voice was very familiar. He turned around and saw the defendant Shen Xisheng standing by. He directed two other people to splash acid on me and then fled. The reason for this grudge is that a villager surnamed Li who ate at a restaurant picked up a leather suitcase containing more than 40 yuan in banknotes, two checks, and a notification from Qianniu Zhaohui in the French Concession. There are two such notifications in the French Concession, so each is worth more than 8,000 yuan. The total value of all items in the leather suitcase was more than 10,000 yuan. Not knowing who it belonged to, he took it back to his hometown. He mentioned this matter to a friend, who suggested that Li could investigate. So two friends accompanied Li to Shanghai and went to the home of A'wu, a servant in a wealthy family, asking him to help find the owner. A'wu called the bank to inquire and learned that it was lost by an apprentice of Yuan Shanbao. The two friends sent the lost items to Yuan, who gave them a reward of 200 yuan. The two friends were polite and only accepted half, 100 yuan. As a result, the two friends embezzled 60 yuan and gave 40 yuan to Li, falsely claiming that although the owner only thanked them with this small amount, he would also recommend them for business. Later, they did not recommend them for business, and Li asked me to inquire about the actual reward amount. After repeated inquiries, I found out that the 60 yuan was embezzled by the two friends. When I asked the two friends, one had already died, and the one who was still alive said that the deceased had used the 60 yuan. Later, I stopped asking. I heard that Li then asked a third party to inquire with A'wu. At that time, I persuaded A'wu to give more money, and A'wu's friend gave 10 yuan. At that time, Shen Xisheng was standing by and said that I was meddling in matters and that this caused a grudge. He used this vicious method to harm me. I used to work with Shen in the Anti-Smoking Supervision Office, so I knew Shen's voice very well, and at that time, I turned around and saw him directing by the side. I request a thorough investigation. Interrogated, the defendant Shen Xisheng denied instigating the splashing of acid to harm the plaintiff. He said that during this time, he was in Anhui, as evidenced by his store owner, etc. He also hired lawyer E Sen to defend him in court. The court also summoned Wu Genrong, the owner of the carpenter shop at No. 94 Weier Meng Road, where the defendant was employed, to testify. According to Wu, Shen Xisheng is indeed a clerk in my shop, but I do not know that he has harmed anyone outside. The court verified the confession and ordered a postponement. The hearing will be resumed at 9 AM on the 20th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>A Baffling Lawsuit Between Lu Qixiang and His Daughter</h3>
<p>Grandson Accused of Robbing Grandfather's Property; Wang Yangyu Hired a Lawyer to Sue</p>
<p>Lu Qixiang, the owner of Renfeng Timber Firm on Gumazhi Road in the Nanshi area and a Haijian native, is of advanced age. He has a son and a daughter. His daughter, Ms. Lu, is 48 years old and married to a man surnamed Wang. They have a grandson, Wang Xingrong, who is also an adult but does not engage in legitimate work and instead associates with bandits. Because Lu Qixiang is old, he has entrusted his business and property to his son, Lu Youchen. Consequently, Ms. Wang Lu and her son, Wang Xingrong, could not get their share. Last December, Wang Xingrong gathered a gang of thieves and robbed his grandfather's house. The police arrested Wang Xingrong and Wang Lu and detained them in the local court, where the case is being investigated. Now, Wang Yangyu has hired lawyer Xu Jiashi on behalf of Wang Lu, suing in the local court to order Lu Youchen to pay 50,000 yuan in alimony. He has also requested free legal aid. The court hearing was held yesterday, and the defendant hired lawyer Huang Jiyuan for the defense, claiming that the lawsuit was a nuisance and requesting that Ms. Wang Lu be brought to court. She claimed that she had not filed a lawsuit and had not hired Xu Jiashi as her lawyer, which is truly baffling. When the magistrate questioned lawyer Xu, he stated that Wang Yangyu had commissioned him and that it was a pro bono case. Since the party involved did not file the lawsuit, it should be considered a withdrawal of the lawsuit. The court ordered that the lawsuit be treated as withdrawn and returned Ms. Wang Lu to custody.</p>
<h3>Huang Youbin Has No Right to Sue Zhou Ajiu for Adultery</h3>
<p>Shui Qitang Also Appeared in Court; Huang Changed the Lawsuit to Accuse Extortion</p>
<p>Huang Youbin, the elderly owner of Longmen Shipyard, has certain ailments. Several years ago, he became involved with a young woman named Zhou Ajiu, and they had a child. They spent years in a lawsuit at the local court over identity and alimony, eventually resolving with her becoming his concubine. They lived together in Yangchang Alley on Fushan Chang Street near Xiaonanmen, with a monthly living allowance of thirty yuan. However, not long after, Ms. Zhou, finding Mr. Huang old and repulsive, fell in love with Shui Qitang, a foreign goods broker, and secretly lived with him at No. 36 Xiaozha Bridge near Xiaonanmen. Not willing to let the old man off easily, they pretended to be cousins and negotiated a separation with Huang, demanding a lump sum of 5,000 yuan as alimony. Huang, knowing that he had no relatives by that name after so many years of cohabitation with Ajiu, had people track them, revealing their secret. On the morning of the ninth of this month at three o'clock, he reported to the police. They rushed to the scene and found Shui and Ajiu in bed together. Their sweet dreams were shattered, and they were arrested and taken to the local court. The prosecutor investigated and determined that since the two were not formally married, Huang had no right to sue. Shui and Ajiu were released on bail. Huang, feeling resentful after spending a lot of money over the years and ending up with a cuckold’s hat, hired a lawyer to change the charges based on Shui and Ajiu's demand for 5,000 yuan in living expenses, accusing them of extortion to vent his anger.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhiming Beaten While Watching Basketball Game</h3>
<p>The Dispute Was Over Tickets; The Result Was Bloodshed</p>
<p>Qian Zhiming, a 26-year-old Jiangyin native, runs Hengsheng Western Clothing Store at No. 235 Meibai Road. Yesterday afternoon around nine o'clock, Qian went to the Xiqing Basketball Hall to watch the basketball game between Jinan University and Mailingjia. At the entrance, due to the large crowd, a misunderstanding arose with the ticket collector. Initially, there was a verbal argument, which escalated into a physical fight. Qian was severely beaten on the head by the ticket collector, causing profuse bleeding. Onlookers were alarmed. The police arrived, and Qian was taken to the hospital for treatment. The ticket collector was taken to the police station for questioning. The ticket collector claimed that it was because Qian did not buy a ticket. However, Qian claimed that he had indeed purchased a ticket and it was taken at the entrance. After entering, the ticket collector demanded another ticket, leading to the argument and the assault.</p>
<h3>Joint Compensation for a Coolie Crushed by a Safe</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council Was Negligent in Supervision; Ordered to Pay One-Quarter of a Thousand Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>On October 8th last year, a truck transporting goods in the French Concession was driving on a certain road when it hit a hole dug by the tram company (not yet paved). The truck body was jolted, causing a heavy safe on the truck to fall off and crush a coolie named He, killing him. The deceased's wife hired a lawyer to sue in the French Consulate Court, demanding compensation for damages. The case was finalized yesterday. The court ordered a compensation of one thousand yuan to be paid to He's wife, half by the truck company due to its negligence in loading the goods. The remaining half was to be shared by the French Municipal Council and the French Tram Company because the tram company failed to mark the dangerous location, and the French Municipal Council was negligent in supervision and could not evade responsibility.</p>
<h3>Rampant Flower Gambling in Zhabei; Yin Houyu Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, flower gambling has been rampant in the Zhabei area. Although the General Bureau has ordered police stations in various districts to strictly search and arrest offenders, several cases have been transferred to the court for judgment. However, it is difficult to apprehend these gamblers because they organize secret locations. Around 7:30 last night, the Linping Road Police Station arrested Yin Houyu (a 34-year-old Huaiyang native residing at No. 33 Dongxing Lane, Oujia Road), a key flower gambling suspect, near Tiantong Road. They seized various evidence such as flower gambling secret codes and gambling funds from the operation site. During interrogation at the police station, Yin confessed to the involvement of several accomplices. The police went to arrest them, but they had already fled upon hearing the news. The search is ongoing. Yin has been sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Dike Built in Racecourse Pond</h3>
<p>Due to the accumulation of sewage in the pond inside the racecourse, which constantly breeds mosquitoes, the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department has raised many small fish in it to eat mosquito larvae and built wooden beams to prevent the fish from being washed away by the tide. However, the previous beams were temporary and not very effective. Approved by the Public Works Department, a permanent dike is now being built in the pond on the east side of the racecourse, near Yuqiaqing Road. This will save on the cost of purchasing small fish and adding mosquito repellent. The project will cost approximately 600 yuan. The Race Club has negotiated with the Public Works Department and will reimburse 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lihua Company Employee Attempted Suicide; Rescued from River</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8 AM, a young man boarded a small boat from the pier across from Jiangmaozhan Foreign Firm on the Bund of Wuma Road.

He identified himself as Wen Worong, 24 years old, from Guangdong. He used to work in the socks department of Lihua Department Store on Nanjing Road and was recently transferred to the same road's Zhonghua Department Store. Yesterday, a female customer purchased a pair of socks from him and paid with a foreign silver dollar. According to regulations, he should have rung the bell to notify the service boy to bring the money and goods in for verification and packaging before handing the socks to the customer to complete the transaction. However, the female customer was impatient and left with the socks directly, leading to a reprimand from the manager. He was frustrated and tired of life. Police officer Huang Songsheng was dispatched to inform his brother, Wen Jianmin, and ask him to take his brother home and comfort him.</p>

<h3>Continued Arrest of Key Suspects in the Jingyun Building Robbery Case, Including Deng Shaochen</h3>
<p>Deng Brought Back from Nantong for Custody; Yu Fengsen Also Arrested</p>
<p>On December 31st last year at 11:30 AM, the accounting office of Liu Jingdetang, located in Room 505 of the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road, was robbed of over 5,000 yuan in national currency. The robbers were pursued as they fled, resulting in the death of Western police officer Sirat and Jingyun Building doorman Pan Shoulong, who were shot by the robbers. The police captured robber Wang Jinsheng alive and killed robber Wang Bingsheng. They recovered a handgun, a Mauser pistol, and a portion of the stolen money. Following this, Chinese and Western detectives from the General Police Station continued to arrest 15 individuals related to the case: Wang Zhongdao, Wen Yongbao, Xu Honglin, Chen Sandi, Yang Longgen, Lu Xu Xiuzhen, Wang Fusan, Xu Yang Linmei, Cao Tongkun, Shi Mingcai, Wang Zhaogu, Wang Qinshi, Yu Weishi, Li You, and Lai Liguang. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Wang Jinsheng confessed that Deng Shaochen, a former detective of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, was his mentor. Deng had repeatedly discussed the robbery with him, and Deng had also supplied the firearms. Police detectives went to Deng's house at No. 3 Jingqin Lane, Guangxi Road, to arrest him, but he had already fled. They learned that Deng was hiding at the Qinyuan Inn in Lianshui Town, Nantong. Chief Detective Zhang Mingde and Detective Jiang Shangpei went there and, together with local police officers, arrested Deng and brought him back to the police station for detention yesterday. It was then learned that Yu Fengsen (residing at No. 23 Qia Xing Lane, Kaifeng Road), from Anhui, was also heavily involved. They then found a way to arrest Yu. Yesterday morning, they sent them to the First Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the circumstances of the arrests and stated that Yu was also guilty of writing threatening letters and that he had previously been sentenced by the Second Special District Court to four months and one year and two months for extortion. Deng's female servant, Jin Ajin, had also been found by the police. She could testify that Wang Jinsheng had indeed spoken privately with her master for an hour or two. Jin Ajin testified that Wang Jinsheng had come to the house and had spoken to her master privately in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. Wang Jinsheng confessed that on the 30th of last month, he had gone with one of the fugitives to his master's house (Deng Shaochen) to discuss the matter. When questioned, Deng Shaochen claimed he was being framed, that Wang Jinsheng was not his apprentice, but that when he was a detective, Wang served as his informant. Recently, Wang had asked him for help with a certain case, but he was planning to arrest him and hand him over to the authorities, which is why Wang was falsely accusing him. Judge Qian Hongye decided to postpone the case for a joint trial with Wang Jinsheng and others.</p>

<h3>Anonymous False Accusation Alarms Thirteen People</h3>
<p>Police Suddenly Arrive to Arrest; Released on Bail After Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8 AM, police arrived at the home of Xue Yulong, the owner of Xuedasheng Candy Shop at No. 65 Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, and arrested Xue Yulong, 28 years old, his wife, Ms. Dong, 21 years old, and eight employees: Cui Jin'er, 34 years old, Zhu Chenglin, 22 years old, Lu Bingshan, 21 years old, Wu Fucai, 36 years old (all from Taixing), Zhu Dianzhi, 46 years old from Zhenjiang, Tian Yushan, 46 years old from Hebei, Zhang Deming, 41 years old from Yixing, and Liu Qingbin, 42 years old from Ningbo, a total of ten men and women. At the same time, Wang Jinsheng, 33 years old from Funing, and Zhu Guangxun, 34 years old from Taizhou, were arrested at the top of Yuanmingsi building at No. 2 Zhifuli, Datong Road. A monk named Zhiyuan, 29 years old, was also arrested. Nearby residents were very suspicious. After investigation, it was learned that the arrested men and women were falsely accused in an anonymous report on the grounds of the suspicion of intimidating and defrauding. Police Captain Qian Tianxiong of the Sixth Division of the Criminal Investigation Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau was assigned to investigate. It was found that Xue Yulong was the owner of the candy shop, and Ms. Dong was his wife. The other eight, including Cui Jin'er, were candy sellers. Wang Jinsheng and Zhu Guangxun, who were arrested at No. 2 Zhifuli, were also poor people. The monk Zhiyuan was Zhu Guangxun's brother, all of whom were good people. The pawn tickets and other items found were all belongings of these poor people. Further investigation revealed that the monk Zhiyuan, whose Dharma name was Mingxing, was the resident monk of Yuanming Temple and hired as a guest teacher and lived upstairs with his brother Zhu Guangxun and Wang Jinsheng. Tian Yushan rented the front building of Xue to make and sell sugar himself. The other seven went out to sell sugar for Xue during the day and returned to Xue's house at night. They were not doing anything illegal. After obtaining this information, the police station will release them on bail.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit to Confirm Parentage Involves Nothing But Money</h3>
<p>Lu Shunxing Shop's Business is Flourishing; Adopted Son Requests Return to the Family</p>
<p>Lu Ashi, a 68-year-old Wuxi native who owns a three-bay Lu Shunxing Machinery Shop at No. 109 Wanyu Street, Wanyu Pier, Nanshi, gave his third son, Lu Ali, 31 years old, to Tang Guigen at No. 47, Mud Ferry, 93rd Alley, Pudong, to be raised at the age of three. Now, his adoptive parents are both dead and the family is struggling financially, while his biological father's business is thriving. Although he has two older brothers, he still hopes to</p>
<p>Get a Piece of the Pie.</p>
<p>He hired lawyer Zhou Lianze to file a lawsuit in the local court against his biological father, Lu Ashi, to confirm their parentage. The original complaint stated: "The plaintiff is the biological son of the defendant, and their relationship is indeed that of father and son. However, the plaintiff's maternal grandmother and the defendant were swayed by superstitious fortunetelling beliefs, claiming that the plaintiff's destiny, specifically the 'birth date and time', clashed with his biological mother, Ms. Lu Zhu. Therefore, when the plaintiff was three years old, and his biological mother was still alive, the defendant, acting as the biological father, had the plaintiff registered under the name of</p>
<p>Tang Guigen's Family.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Tang family treated him with love, allowing him to grow into adulthood. However, he maintained contact with the defendant, attending to his needs. Last January, Tang Guigen passed away, and the family's fortunes have been declining. The plaintiff lost his job and has no means of livelihood. He was forced to ask the defendant and his biological brothers, Lu Guanlin and Lu Genfa, for housing and work to support himself, but he was severely rejected and almost poisoned. For over a year, he has been wandering around, in great pain.</p>
<p>Despite Being Blood Relatives,</p>
<p>They treat him like a stranger, as if he were not their own. In fact, the plaintiff's face, voice, and demeanor are very similar to those of the defendant and his two older brothers, which can be verified upon inspection. Yet, they are so indifferent to the plaintiff, showing their heartlessness and disregard for natural human relationships. The plaintiff is now in a precarious situation, without a place to call home, and is ridiculed by the world. He hired a lawyer to send a letter of advice, but it was ignored. Therefore, he is requesting the court to rule," etc. Yesterday, Judge Yu held a hearing. Lu Ali recounted the events. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Wenjun to defend him, stating, "The plaintiff is his biological son. When he was two years old, he was given to Tang Guigen.</p>
<p>There Has Been No Contact Since.</p>
<p>I absolutely do not recognize him and will not take this son back. Furthermore, my parents passed away when I was thirteen years old. I went out to learn blacksmithing, working hard to operate the bellows, and even sold sorghum stalks. To succeed, one must work hard and cannot be lazy and greedy for wealth. He already carries the surname Tang, and the Tang family arranged his marriage. Moreover, I still have two sons, Guanlin and Genfa," etc. The plaintiff stated, "I was only registered under the name Tang, but I have always used the surname Lu outside, and I have often visited. I married Pan Yinzhu at the age of twenty-one and have a son, Genfu, and a daughter. I am now unemployed and want to return to my father's family." The judge noted that his claim was all about money. Lu Ashi was not exactly willing to take on an extra son for fear of riling his two sons. So they decided to postpone the trial and summon the two sons, Guanlin and Genfa, to court to hear their opinions before making a decision.</p>

<h3>Everyone is Happy: Military Academy Beats Sintoon by Two Points</h3>
<p>Thirty-one to Twenty-nine, A One-Ball Difference</p>
<p>The Overall Game Situation Was Extremely Tense</p>
<p>Military Academy Leaves Shanghai for Soviet Union This Morning</p>
<p>The Central Military Academy basketball team suffered a great defeat by the Sintoon team in Nanjing. The entire team arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to respond. Last night, they played a second match against Sintoon at the Shenyuan basketball court and again defeated Sintoon by 31 to 29, two points more. In the first half, the Military Academy led by three points with 19 to 16. In the five minutes of the game, the competition was extremely tense. Sintoon took the lead for the first time, and Wang Yuzeng, the center of the Military Academy, was also fouled out at this time with four fouls. Both sides were panicked. In the end, because the Military Academy had good luck, Bao Wenpei made two long shots, scoring two goals in a row, and reversed the defeat. Last night, due to the rain, the audience was not very crowded, about a thousand people or more. The entire Military Academy team is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Soviet Union this morning. Other games in Shanghai have been cancelled.</p>
<p>Military Academy's Basketball Skills</p>
<p>Last night's performance by the two teams was neck and neck. The outcome can be said to have depended on luck. Both sides had shortcomings. The Military Academy was better than Sintoon in passing skills. The Military Academy also had more shooting opportunities, but unfortunately the shooting was too poor, only two or three out of ten shots were made. Speaking of Wang Yuzeng, he made only three goals in the net out of dozens of close and long shots. Guo Zhen was very good. Bao Wenpei could not show his color at all. If the shooting was a little more accurate, the Military Academy would have won a great victory early on, without waiting for the tense situation that followed. The two guards were the most outstanding, with Zhao Zhihua being slightly better than Wang Shixuan.</p>
<p>Sintoon's Performance</p>
<p>As for the Sintoon team, it also suffered some obstacles. The biggest one was the unfamiliarity of the court. Sintoon abandoned the familiar ground of West Qing and suddenly enlarged the court. As a result, the short passes in West Qing all failed. The tall player Ryan also greatly reduced his effectiveness, almost to zero. Only Carson, Skwia, and Besser were still as imposing as ever, brave and terrifying. Sintoon's defense last night was extremely tight. This is why the three forwards of the Military Academy could not penetrate Sintoon's basket.</p>
<p>Leading All the Way</p>
<p>Referee Zhang Guoxun and Dai Changling blew the whistle to start the game. The Military Academy took the offensive first and entered the basket. Guo Zhen made the first shot, but it was not successful. Wang Yuzeng continued to make a shot, but it also failed. Passing back and forth, Guo Zhen got the ball and flew in, opening the record. Cheers erupted. Carson returned a goal. Wang Yuzeng, Guo Zhen, and Bao Wenpei scored three goals. The Military Academy took the lead with eight to two, and the momentum was very strong. Sintoon launched a fierce counterattack. The Military Academy always took the lead, 13 to 5, 18 to 11, 19 to 13. Carson scored two goals. The first half ended with a score of 19 to 16.</p>
<h3>The Military Academy's Basketball Team</h3>
<p>— (International News Agency)</p>
<p>Sintoon Exceeds</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Sintoon changed to a violent offensive. Wang Yuzeng and Guo Zhen still caught them unprepared, scoring one after another, making the score twelve to three to sixteen. Wang Yuzeng was fouled for the third time at this time. Carson scored. After the Military Academy suffered this major impact, Sintoon took the opportunity to attack, and Skwia and Carson scored each other, actually chasing the score to a tie of twenty-five. The panic of the Military Academy was already apparent. With Pisel's one goal, Sintoon took the lead for the first time.</p>
<p>Final Change</p>
<p>The central player Wang Yuzeng was suddenly fouled out for the fourth time at this time. Fortunately, he was not fouled in. Li Shenchun entered, and the two sides fell into an extremely tense and chaotic mixed war. At this time, there were still three minutes left to the end. The emotions of the audience also reached a boiling point. Guo Zhen threw far from the left corner and scored first, tying the score. The viewers were greatly relieved. Bao Wenpei shot far away and again entered the net. Sintoon raised its head again. However, Ryan made a shot under the basket, tying the score again. The Military Academy had great luck. In the last fifty seconds, Bao Wenpei's second long shot was successful. The Military Academy won by this goal.</p>

<h3>Self-Governance</h3>
<p>— Wanwen</p>
<p>The self-governance I'm talking about today isn't local self-governance. To narrow the scope further, it's about how individuals can govern themselves. This is because local self-governance is created by individuals who can govern themselves and help each other. So, individual self-governance is much more important than local self-governance.</p>
<p>Whether a person can govern themselves is most clearly expressed in a group. A group is formed by a number of people. If someone can't govern themselves, they'll disrupt the order, and it's easy for people to notice. This damages their own reputation.</p>
<p>Children spend most of their lives at school. School is also a group, so whether children can govern themselves will be known in daily life.</p>
<p>Ordinary students' self-governance can be divided into three situations:</p>
<p>The first type of person can't govern themselves at all. They disrupt the order no matter what the situation. Teachers need to strictly discipline these people, because going to school is not only about learning, but also about learning to be a person. Eventually, this person will reform and start anew.</p>
<p>The second type of person is very well-behaved in front of teachers, but when the teachers aren't around, they make noise arbitrarily. I think this type of person is more hateful than the person who can't govern themselves at all. Teachers can still supervise the former to reform, but the latter is unknown to the teachers. The encouragement of classmates is treated as irrelevant, and they say that others are meddling. What good is that? I hope these people wake up quickly!</p>
<p>The third type of person can govern themselves completely. Of course, they deserve our admiration. But I still hope that you help others. Even if you are sometimes ridiculed, being able to do your best to persuade others to reform is also a joy.</p>
<p>In this way, if everyone can govern themselves as individuals, local self-governance will be easy to implement, and the order of the country will not be difficult to maintain permanently.</p>
<h3>The Story of Qi Jiguang Pacifying the Border</h3>
<p>— Dazhong Bing</p>
<p>Children! Do you know that during the Ming Dynasty, there was a famous general who defeated the Japanese pirates several times? That famous general was named Qi Jiguang, courtesy name Yuanjing, and he was from Dingyuan. From a young age, he liked to read military books and gained a lot of military knowledge. So, in his prime, he became a Deputy Commander-in-Chief and went to Shandong to defend against the Japanese pirates. In the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing, the Japanese pirates disturbed the Zhejiang border. Jiguang was ordered to be transferred to Zhejiang and led his troops to suppress them fiercely. He won nine consecutive battles, captured more than two thousand prisoners, and killed countless Japanese pirates. Jiguang was rewarded for his merits and was promoted three ranks. A year later, the Japanese pirates invaded outside the Great Wall, Chifeng and Duolun, and gradually spread to Dehua and Shangdu. So, Suiyuan was in urgent need of help. Jiguang was ordered to suppress them again and won a great victory. When Jiguang entered Wuchuan City, southeast of Bailingmiao, the local people were slaughtering cattle and pigs, and those who were brewing wine were delivering dishes. The streets showed cheers: "Long live General Qi, long live Qi's ever-victorious army." Also, to commemorate his achievements, a Pacifying the Border Terrace was built, and his achievements were engraved on a stone tablet on the Pacifying the Border Terrace. For more than ten years, everything was safe and sound. Unexpectedly, there was a treacherous official named Zhang Dingsi who said, "Jiguang is not suitable for the north." The ruler transferred him to Guangdong. Throughout his life, Jiguang had two important words on managing troops: "Orders are strict, rewards and punishments are clear."</p>
<p>Children, the story of General Qi Jiguang pacifying the border, less than a hundred years after the event, Suiyuan was again invaded by bandits. General Fu Zuoyi is determined to defend Suiyuan for the country with his comrades in the north, vowing not to retreat a step. They are fighting for the country under the freezing snow, seemingly upholding the heroic legacy of Qi Jiguang. But we can't help but worry, can General Fu alone defend Suiyuan? I hope that all the children in the country can save their candy money and donate it to Suiyuan. This is material assistance. At the same time, everyone should be of one mind and work together to defend Suiyuan, not allowing an inch of land to be taken by the enemy.</p>
<h3>General Fu</h3>

<p>Ten years ago,</p>
<p>Firmly defending Zhuozhou was known throughout the world;</p>

<h3>A Page from the Diary of a Soldier on the Front Line</h3>
<p>— Yu Ji</p>
<p>Today the temperature has dropped a lot. Everything is in a silver world. My hands and feet are so cold that they have lost their sense of touch and can no longer be controlled. But my heart is much warmer than usual. Thinking about this now still makes me feel happy. Damn it! That dwarf is really useless. After being caught by me, he actually knelt down and kowtowed to me, and babbled some ghost words that I couldn't understand. Looking at it, I felt both angry and amused. God really gave him a man's body in vain. When I first came to the front line, I was still a little timid, thinking that those guys were always much more powerful than our compatriots. Haha! It turns out they are just some cunning little mice.</p>
<p>Just now the front line was fighting fiercely. We were lying in the trenches, waiting leisurely. Seeing them rushing towards us in large numbers, a few rows of guns were fired, and one by one they fell down, the snow was dyed red, and it was really enjoyable for me!</p>
<p>Commander Chen gave a speech to our team, saying that all provinces in the country are enthusiastically comforting us, and there are often funds and winter clothes delivered. He encouraged the brothers to be especially brave in killing the enemy, and not to think that we are satisfied with the recovery of Bailingmiao. We must also recover all the lost land and wash away all the insults we have suffered before we can be satisfied. Huh! Needless to say? My blood is already boiling. I used to suffer from not having a chance, but now I don't have a good time to do it. When will I wait? It's also good to let me vent my anger.</p>
<p>I wonder how Xiao Wu Zi and his mother are now? That sturdy woman, when I left home that day, her crying face also turned into a smile. Damn it! Don't think about those things. When we are slaves of the devils, what kind of home is there? Xiao Wu Zi's mother will have to be taken by someone else to be his wife. Xiao Wu Zi, this little thing, even if he doesn't die, will no longer be my son. Damn it! It's still everything, kill him cleanly. Even if I lose my life, it is glorious to be a ghost. This time I am fighting to protect the integrity of the territory, and I am fighting for the survival of the nation, not for the leaders to fight for territory. Even if I am a sacrifice, die on the battlefield, and my family is scattered, I can still be worthy of the Great Republic of China and every compatriot of the Great Republic of China!</p>

<h3>Hand Shadow Play</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Jingxia</p>
<h3>Roar, China!</h3>
<p>— Big Kid</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>The war in Suiyuan has been going on for more than two months now. In these two months, the efforts of the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line to resist the enemy, and the enthusiastic assistance of the patriotic people in the rear, have raised the glorious, great, and national self-salvation banner high. The torch of the nation has been held by every member of the country, and the fire has shone all over the world, making monsters disappear, making villains tremble, making ordinary strongholds dare not act recklessly, and making nations that despise us also know to respect us. We should take this opportunity to wash away many past shames.</p>
<p>Suiyuan is the front line of our national defense. We must protect our territory, we must protect our sovereignty, we do not want to be slaves, so we cannot ignore the war of resistance in Suiyuan. Although Suiyuan is far away from us, its pain is very deeply felt. Therefore, we should consider this a matter of the survival of our entire country and nation. Perhaps this is the prelude to the start of a major war. Therefore, we hope that the soldiers and civilians, young and old, throughout the country will rise up together to deal with it. We must be prepared to resist to the end, because their ambitions are undying and their tricks are many. If the Suiyuan side is not successful, they may suddenly try to launch another attack from elsewhere. At present, we must prepare for defense as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Dear children, how do you feel if our China unfortunately becomes the second Korea, Taiwan, Annam, or Burma one day? If this place becomes the Northeast, and you are a compatriot of the Northeast, would you also feel sad! Now, our country is in danger, and the survival of our nation has reached the last juncture. If we do not rise up to seek self-salvation quickly, if we do not rise up to resist together, the great Republic of China may become the second Korea, Taiwan, Annam, or Burma, and we will follow in the footsteps of our compatriots in the Northeast. Just imagine, how terrible is this!</p>
<p>Although we are still some minors, we should also be concerned about the survival of the country. Although the responsibility for saving the country should be borne by the adults, the idea of loving the country must be cultivated from childhood.</p>
<p>Look! The alarm bell of our national self-salvation has sounded all over the world. The Battle of Suiyuan is still our first bell sound -</p>
<p>Roar, China! We must roar from this corner and make the whole country roar!</p>
<p>"A Corner of Roaring China"! We must roar from this corner and make the whole country roar!</p>

<h3>A Letter from Chinese Children to Japanese Children</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yiju</p>
<p>Dear children:</p>
<p>We suddenly gave you this letter, you must be surprised to receive it? But don't be surprised, we wrote this letter because we saw the current tense situation between our two countries, and wanted to connect the feelings of the children of our two countries to promote the national relations between the two countries and to be friendly. I think you would also be willing!</p>
<p>We often hear the teacher say that the people of our two countries are both yellow people, and also have the same writing. It is not a good phenomenon for people of the same race to have hostile behavior! We should connect and be friendly, and struggle together with other races in the world, so that we can show the status of our yellow people in the world.</p>
<p>Now your government is putting heavy pressure on our government. Large numbers of troops have been sent to the North China area and are constantly practicing. In Shanghai, sailors are landing and showing off their power, it really looks like a big war is about to begin. Have you seen this situation? Are you satisfied with this behavior?</p>
<p>Our children are the masters of the two countries in the future, and are responsible for the construction and survival of the two countries in the future. Therefore, we should urge the government to implement friendship with each other. We hope that you will advise your government on this reason: change the current attitude of pressure and replace it with a policy of equality and mutual benefit, then we will really clap our hands and celebrate. I wonder what you think?</p>
<p>Sincerely, I wish you good health!</p>

<h3>Deep Sea Dream Journey</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhongyu</p>
<p>(22) After a while, a deep-sea fish with a white peacock head came. The fish swam very slowly and looked very gentle. (23) Min'er watched for a while. Then he became bold. (24) He rode on the back of the fish and traveled back and forth in the sea with the fish. (25) He was having a great time riding when he encountered a small and terrible sea snake. (26) The scare made Min'er fall off the white fish's back.</p>
<p>Children's World</p>
<h3>Shark</h3>
<p>— Zhongmei</p>
<p>Today, after Min'er finished preparing his homework, he was flipping through a book about various large and small fish. He looked at each page very carefully, but when he turned to the last page of the book, he didn't understand what kind of fish it was. So he took the picture to ask his brother, and his brother replied, "This is a very fierce fish that lives in the ocean called a shark. Its body shape is slender and about twelve or three feet long. The back is light gray with white spots and contains granular fine scales. The nose is protruding, and the nostrils and white part are open on the underside of the body. This is the characteristic of a shark. There are five pairs of gill slits on the left and right sides of the body, with gills inside, but no gill covers on the outside. Its dorsal fin is divided into two parts, front and back. The front fin is larger than the back line and is far away from the back fin."</p>
<p>"What shape are the shark's abdominal fins, anal fins, pectoral fins, and caudal fins, and where are they located?"</p>
<p>"Its abdominal and anal fins are very small and grow on the underside of the abdomen and anus. The pectoral fins are triangular and grow under the five pairs of gill slits. The shape of the caudal fin is irregular, with the upper lobe very large and the lower lobe very small, called a lopsided tail. This caudal fin is of course on the tail."</p>
<p>"What is the shark's method of reproduction? Does it reproduce by laying eggs?"</p>
<p>"The shark's method of reproduction is not by laying eggs, but by giving birth to small fish viviparously. The fetus is covered by a cyst. Each cyst produces two small sharks. Therefore, in May and June each year, a total of about ten sharks are produced each time."</p>
<p>"So, what is the shark's use in industry or food?"</p>
<p>"The function of sharks in the king's industry is to use their rough and hard skin, which can be used to polish various objects. In terms of food, their fins are made into shark fins after a series of manufacturing processes, which are valuable foods on banquets. Their meat is not very tasty, but it can also be eaten. The cartilage in their heads and gills can be used to make bright bone, which can also be used for food. Their livers can be made into cod liver oil, which is a medicine to strengthen our bodies, and the eggs are rich in yolk and can also be used as food."</p>

<h3>How to Raise Funds for Suiyuan Relief?</h3>
<p>Reply to Li Renhe of Zhongshan County</p>
<p>Renhe, my brother:</p>
<p>We were very excited and pleased to read your letter filled with patriotism in one go. We have decided to reply to your questions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>How exactly should we raise funds for Suiyuan relief? This is indeed the most pressing concern for every Boy Scout right now. In our opinion, within a Boy Scout troop, there are at least the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Save on Daily Expenses: If we want to raise funds, we must first start with ourselves. We should save any unnecessary expenses every day. If your troop has considerable savings, isn't now the time to use them?</p>
<p>(2) Solicit Donations from Others at Any Time: In addition to our own donations, we should also encourage others to donate at any time. Whenever there is an opportunity, we should encourage people to support Suiyuan. As for whether donations are collected by you on our behalf, or delivered by them to local collection points, it doesn't matter, as long as we achieve the goal of supporting Suiyuan.</p>
<p>(3) Sell Works and Valuables: Well-preserved items made as class assignments, handicrafts we make ourselves, and personal valuables (such as toys, valuable stamps, etc.) can all be sold, and we can ask enthusiastic people to purchase them. We believe that enthusiastic patriots will definitely give you a higher price than the cost. We have already suggested this method to the China Boy Scout Group 177.</p>
<p>(4) Collect Natural Objects for Sale: Don't we have assignments to collect natural objects in our advanced courses? We can now collect various natural objects, such as beautiful flower branches, pretty shells, and exquisite pebbles, as well as wild herbs for medicine, and we can collect them and sell them for money.</p>
<p>(5) Solicit Daily Necessities for Peddling: We can also solicit various daily necessities and books from major stores and peddle them to the outside world. We believe that enthusiastic merchants will definitely support you.</p>
<p>(6) Fundraising Entertainment Performances: You can join with other troops to hold campfire gatherings (which are still suitable in your southern region, because the weather is not very cold) or entertainment fairs, sell tickets, and use the proceeds to support Suiyuan.</p>
<p>The above points are the majority of the many methods we can implement. We believe you will design many more clever methods. However, before proceeding, there must first be an organization, and the steps for implementation must be carefully discussed. Due to space limitations, we cannot tell you in detail here.</p>
<p>In addition, we also want to tell you some news, which is that we recently wrote a letter to the General Association of the China Boy Scouts, proposing two general mobilization plans for national Boy Scout support of Suiyuan. First, we hope that the General Association will order the Boy Scout governing bodies in various parts of the country to gather Boy Scouts in their respective areas to collect local waste materials (such as bottles, old clothes, broken utensils, etc.), and call on waste merchants to auction them off for cash to contribute to the government. We call this the National Boy Scout Waste Collection Suiyuan Relief Mobilization. Second, we hope that the General Association will set a date for the Boy Scout governing bodies in various places to prepare campfire gatherings or entertainment fairs, and have Boy Scouts across the country hold them simultaneously on the designated date to collect funds to support Suiyuan. We call this the National Boy Scout Campfire Performance Suiyuan Relief Mobilization. We hope that the General Association will adopt our suggestions. Do you think our methods are feasible?</p>
<p>Farewell, we are waiting here for news of your Suiyuan relief efforts! Wishing you every success!</p>
<p>Respectfully replied by the China Boy Scout Self-Help Society</p>
<h3>Suiyuan Relief Song</h3>
<h3>Filial Piety (12)</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>She did not forget the two old gentlemen who had been exiled to Siberia with her father; they had treated her exceptionally well. She mentioned them to many people, but people often advised her not to bring them up with her father's case, because too many requests might be detrimental to her father. However, before long, she received news that the emperor had issued an edict, pardoning her father. Moreover, the emperor was willing to know if Bosikefei herself had any requests. She replied in haste that she was deeply grateful for the grace she had received and dared not ask for anything else, only hoping that the emperor would show further grace and pardon the two poor old gentlemen. The emperor, seeing that Bosikefei had no selfish motives whatsoever, was even more moved. He investigated the crimes committed by the two men and found that they were all political in nature and had already been exiled for many years, so he issued an edict pardoning them as well.</p>
<p>Boshenkefei, to express her gratitude to God for her father's pardon, voluntarily devoted herself to becoming a nun. She was drawn to the nunnery in the Nihi area, because she had previously been treated there when she was ill. However, first, she had to go to Kiev, the place where the first Christians in Russia were initially trained. The tombs of the devout Empress Saint Urga and the idol-destroying Saint Fotimo were also there, and she prepared to visit them. After worshiping, Bosikefei took her vows of monasticism there. It was somewhat strange that such a filial daughter would become a nun without the permission of her parents. However, when she went to Beijing to seek permission from her parents, she had secretly vowed to repay God in this way. Now that she had achieved her goal, she fulfilled her vow. She returned to Nihi from Kiev, hoping to meet her parents, as she estimated that the two old people would be returning from Siberia at this time. When she saw the abbess of the nunnery, she asked earnestly if there was any news of the two old people. The abbess said quickly, "The news is very good, come to my room and I'll tell you more." Bosikefei quietly followed her into the reception room and saw her father and mother standing there! When they saw their hardworking daughter, they were so moved that they knelt down without realizing it. She hurriedly knelt down as well and exclaimed, "What is this? Know that this is all God's help, we should thank God for the grace He has bestowed upon us."</p>
<p>Colonel Lauboluo husband and wife and their beloved daughter reunited for a week, enjoying the happiness of family. They then agreed to return to their hometown together. Bosikefei spent the rest of her life in the nunnery. However, the long journey in earlier years, having experienced all kinds of hardships, had damaged her health, and she grew weaker day by day. Although she survived several years and saw her parents again, her body was very weak. Once, she went to St. Petersburg, where someone saw her and said that she had a beautiful oval face, a pair of jet-black eyes, and a broad forehead. Her expression carried a melancholy smile, but her demeanor was very calm.</p>
<p>On December 9, 1809, Bosikefei's ailing body could no longer support itself. That morning, she was lying quietly in her bed in the chapel, surrounded by the nuns who were talking beside her, watching her gradually wither away. They hurriedly left her and went out to pray, leaving only one person singing hymns aloud. Bosikefei begged her not to sing so loudly, because the sound disturbed her prayers. That night, they let her lie there, not daring to disturb her again. The next morning, they saw that she had already passed away, her hands crossed over her chest in the shape of a cross.

<h3>An Analysis of the Moroccan Crisis</h3>
<p>— Luo Qun</p>
<p>The world situation is becoming increasingly tense day by day. Although 1936, which was generally considered a year of international crisis, has passed, the world, full of the smell of gunpowder, continues to show its turbulence and unrest. Take the Spanish Civil War, for example. Although the two sides have been fighting for four or five months, and hundreds of thousands of people have been sacrificed, there is still no sign of ending. Not only is it not ending, but because various countries have actively participated in this war, the content of this war has become increasingly complex, and its international impact has become increasingly broad. Until recently, it has become even more chaotic and serious due to rumors of German troops entering Morocco.</p>
<p>According to a Havas dispatch from the 9th, "In the past ten days, a large number of German troops have landed in the Spanish Moroccan port of Melilla and are stationed in the port. These German troops are fully armed and wear military uniforms. In addition, three German destroyers and several submarines are docked in the port of Melilla, and there are many German engineers and workers." At the same time, a Reuters dispatch from London stated, "In the past few days, two to three hundred German troops have landed at various ports in Spanish Morocco." In addition, newspapers in London and Paris have repeatedly published news of German troops landing in Spanish Morocco and building defensive fortifications. Although Berlin has repeatedly denied it, it is probably not without reason.</p>
<p>Morocco is an important place in North Africa and a key point where international relations are complicated. The German invasion will undoubtedly immediately arouse protests from France. The French government has publicly stated that if Germany sends more troops to Morocco, France will consider military action. Moreover, there is news that Defense Minister Daladier will lead staff to inspect the area in person. At the same time, diplomacy is frequent between London and Paris, and German and French newspapers are engaged in fierce written battles. From all aspects of the situation, the entry of German troops into Morocco has become a serious international problem.</p>
<p>Morocco is a colony in Africa, located in the northwest corner of Africa. Before 1912, it was an independent kingdom, but because of its political and economic backwardness, it later became the object of contention among the great powers, especially because it was close to the borders of France and Spain, which made it the focus of the struggle between the two countries. In 1902, France and Italy concluded a secret agreement, in which France allowed Italy to occupy Tripoli without interference, and Italy would not oppose France seizing Morocco. In 1904, Britain and France established compromise conditions, in which France allowed Britain freedom of action in Egypt, in exchange for Britain's commitment to France's freedom of action in Morocco. Soon, France and Spain signed a treaty dividing the two countries' spheres of influence in Morocco. Although Germany and France had major disputes over the Moroccan issue, resulting in moments of war, after a settlement was reached, France ceded a part of Equatorial Africa to Germany and completely seized Morocco for itself. In 1921, France declared Morocco its protectorate, making Morocco its property.</p>
<p>After France acquired Morocco, it made every effort to strengthen its rule there, such as adding defensive fortifications and intensifying the suppression of the Riff people, mainly because this place is very important to France. First, it occupies the northwest corner of Africa, just south of the Strait of Gibraltar, and has significant control over traffic in the Mediterranean and even in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Second, its southern basin is a gathering place for camel caravans and a key point for political traffic in North and West Africa, which is essential for ruling the entire West Africa. Third, many cities along the Atlantic coast in this place are commercially prosperous, rich in products, have a mild climate, and have a large population, making it economically valuable. Because of this, Morocco is simply France's important base in the Mediterranean and the nerve center for its rule over the West African colonies. France undoubtedly attaches great importance to this place. No wonder Paris felt so uneasy when it heard the news of the German invasion.</p>
<p>We know that since the outbreak of the Spanish war, Germany has been doing its best to assist Franco's Nationalists. Its role, on the one hand, is to want to support a country similar in nature to itself in the Iberian Peninsula, in order to expand its camp, and on the other hand, it is precisely to take the opportunity to extend its power into North Africa and seize colonial interests on the north shore of the Mediterranean. When it first began to assist the Nationalist army in Spain, it was rumored internationally that Franco had agreed to cede the rights of Morocco to Germany. Although this may not be absolutely credible, Germany's desire to obtain a portion of its power in North Africa is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>If Germany really obtains some kind of military base in Spanish Morocco and strengthens its power, then the traffic in the Strait of Gibraltar in the Mediterranean will inevitably be threatened by Germany, and France's colonies in West Africa will also face a crisis, and France's power, which has always dominated the western Mediterranean, will inevitably be greatly affected.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from the 10th, "French officials said that the continuous influx of Germans into Spanish Morocco in Africa has caused a very serious situation. Berlin's denial of the existence of German troops in Morocco has made people even more alarmed. According to a firm statement here, the German power in Morocco is a serious hazard to France's defense arrangements." From this, we can see how apprehensive the French side is.</p>
<p>The future development of this incident mainly depends on the attitude of the UK. If the UK firmly stands on the same line as France, then Germany's actions can be temporarily restrained; otherwise, the future will become even more chaotic. According to the current situation, the UK's attitude is somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, for the sake of the safety of its own imperial traffic, it certainly hopes to be consistent with France in preventing Germany from developing towards Morocco. But on the other hand, it also hopes that German troops can help Franco, so at present, it has repeatedly stated, "The stationing of German troops in Morocco has not reached the level necessary for the UK to actively intervene." This means that it is not very important at present. Naturally, if the number of German troops increases further and its power becomes even more developed, the UK will never sit idly by. In short, the situation in the western Mediterranean, due to the outbreak of the Spanish war, has already been very turbulent. Now, due to the Moroccan issue, this turbulence has become even more urgent.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang During the Northern Expedition</h3>
<p>— Liu Xin</p>
<p>The first time I "met" this leader of a million troops was at the grand gathering held by the Huangpu Military Academy to welcome the representatives of the Second National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang. That afternoon, I arrived at the Huangpu Military Academy by small boat with the representatives from Guangzhou. As the students of the fourth term lined up outside the school gate and saluted with their guns, I felt the weight of the Party's mission on my shoulders. At the same time, I also felt a bit proud, because I was probably the youngest among the representatives, although in terms of qualifications, I might not be as good as them.</p>
<p>This "leader of a million troops," who was also the principal of the military academy, was standing in front of the hall of the military academy waiting for us. So we entered in single file, and he smiled and shook hands with us in turn. At that time, although I was already twenty-three years old, I still had the innocence of a child, not to mention that old-fashioned ideas of localism were also filling my head. Even now, it is still the same sometimes. When he shook hands with me, I was having such despicable thoughts:</p>
<p>"Principal Chiang, I am also from Fenghua!"</p>
<p>In the evening, in the rectangular hall, countless dining tables were arranged in long, neat rows of four, which could accommodate two or three hundred people. The flowers in vases on the white tablecloths shone brightly under the strong electric lights. Western meals costing five Guangdong silver dollars per person were being delivered to the representatives' seats one after another. The yellow belts on the young military officers' bodies and the golden badges on the representatives' chests seemed to be predicting the great and glorious future of China. In everyone's firm eyes, calm faces, impassioned tones, and decisive attitudes, there was a hidden and irresistible force, as if these two or three hundred people were two or three hundred bombs that would soon be classified and explode everywhere.</p>
<p>The female comrades were silent, the male comrades were lively. There were no beautiful songs or dances, no charming music, and nothing that could disturb the revolutionary atmosphere was allowed into the room, but everyone's heart was filled with revelry. Here, hermits will retreat, poets will remove their garlands, laymen will grasp butcher knives, and scholars will be inspired. Here, although there is fine wine, it does not intoxicate; although there are beautiful women, they do not seduce. Three parts of romance are mixed with seven parts of solemnity, and a small amount of sadness is mixed with a large amount of generosity. In this way, wise men gather, and many wills become one. The life of the nation is nourished, and the foundation of the party and the state is established.</p>
<p>Thus, in such an indescribable mood, Principal Chiang, with his piercing eyes, slightly dark complexion, high forehead, and lean face, dressed in military uniform and straw sandals, smiled and raised his wine glass, urging us to have another drink. As the wine reached a state of half-intoxication, a thunderous "Comrades!" broke through the noisy voices of the representatives. At the same time, I glimpsed a certain Mr. So-and-so, a representative of a certain military special party department in the next seat. His clenched left hand seemed to shake violently. Yes, Principal Chiang was beginning to make an impassioned speech.</p>
<p>The content of his speech that day focused on foreign and domestic policies. The wording was concise and stimulating, earning the representatives and a group of Huangpu students standing outside the hall continuous applause. Often, after saying only one or two sentences, a burst of thunderous applause interrupted his speech. Whenever this happened, he always looked at the dining table, hoping that the applause would stop. At the same time, his firm gaze showed that he could not only talk the talk, but also walk the walk.</p>
<p>When the army went to Nanchang, due to changes in the objective situation, the entire revolutionary route was slightly different from before. During this period, we could even more see that Chiang was a great military leader with strict military discipline. Therefore, whenever the General Headquarters held a memorial week for the Premier, I never dared to stand in the front row frankly, for fear that he would find some flaw in me and scold me. On this day, I always had to wear my green military uniform more neatly and cleanly than usual, and every button was buttoned properly. The military cap on my head was also worn appropriately, neither crooked nor leaning to the left or right, making sure that the position of the black lacquered brim was exactly in place, like a duck's bill. Usually, I was always too lazy to wrap my leggings. In fact, most of the time it was because I was too busy with work. The pair of Chen Jiageng rubber shoes on my feet (these shoes were very convenient for marching. One day I wore these shoes and ran a distance of one hundred and sixty li day and night, and my feet did not even get blisters) were not often washed, but rather allowed the grayish-white mud to lie comfortably on the green shoe surface. Only on this day would I put on my leggings, and wrap them evenly and firmly. At the same time, I had to use a scrubbing brush to clean all the mud off my shoe surface.</p>
<p>One day, it was again the day of the Premier's memorial week. Chiang, wearing the red duty officer's sash, stepped onto the stage to deliver a military and political report amidst the drawn-out "Attention!" of the duty officer. He first looked at the officers standing in the audience participating in the memorial week from left to right, with two majestic lights unique to military leaders radiating from his eyes, and then began to speak. That day, he spoke about the issue of military discipline. He first scolded the guards severely, saying that they often huddled their hands together when standing at the door, with absolutely no spirit. Suddenly, his angry eyes swept over the officers standing solemnly in front of him, like searchlights seeming to search for something. Then he asked loudly:</p>
<p>"Where is the commander of the guard regiment? Why is he not here today?" The air suddenly became tense, as if something serious was about to happen.</p>
<p>But there was no reply. Everyone was silent, not daring to make a sound. So Chiang reprimanded the commander of the guard regiment to the crowd.</p>
<p>That day, I happened to be standing in the first row. His eyes, burning with the fire of anger, flashed like lightning, especially clearly and terrifyingly in front of me. His thunderous voice hit my eardrums like a barrage of lead, wave after wave. Almost not a single word was willing to escape from my ears easily. Of course, he was not scolding me, but I did feel a terror - the terror of suddenly encountering a storm on a cloudy street. I felt as if I was standing there taking the blame for someone else. I can say that during that memorial week, I stood woodenly throughout, without moving at all. My eyes stared blankly at his face, not daring to look left or right, to show that my full attention was being focused unreservedly on his speech. Although he had lightly and casually shouted a command that seemed like a command but wasn't a command, "At ease!" before he began his speech, in fact, I stood in the "attention" posture, with my chest out and my belly protruding, for a full hour.</p>
<h3>The Origins of Southern Chinese Ethnic Groups</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>Although China's ethnic groups are broadly classified into Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, there are actually more than just these five. Moreover, each of these groups can be further divided into several types. For example, the Hui can be divided into "cooked" Hui and "raw" Hui. However, the most complex ethnic system in China, apart from Xinjiang, is probably that of the various ethnic groups in the south. The "south" here refers to the area south of the Yangtze River, with its main regions being the provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Judging from the complexity of the language systems of Fujian and Guangdong, one can also understand the large number of ethnic groups there.</p>
<p>The indigenous ethnic groups of China can be roughly divided into more than a dozen types, including the Jing, Yue, Hakka, Dan, Yao, Zhuang, Li, Luo Luo, Miao, Bai Yi, Xifan, as well as Nu Yi, Lisu, Mo Xie, Minjiazi, and Zhong people. Now, let's briefly describe the origins of each ethnic group.</p>
<p>The Jing people occupy Hubei and have blood ties with the Miao people. The Chu state was also a branch of the Jing, with its base in present-day Zigui County in Jingnan Dao, Hubei. Later, they occupied a large part of Hubei and confronted the Han Chinese during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Their ancestor was Yuxiong. The Shu people were affiliated with the Jing, as mentioned in the Book of Songs: "Jing and Shu are punished." They were located around present-day Lujiang and Fengyang in Anhui and were destroyed by Chu. During the Spring and Autumn period, they were assimilated by the Han Chinese. The Wu people occupied the area south of the Huai and Si rivers to Jiaxing and Huzhou in Zhejiang. Their founding ancestors were Taibo and Zhongyong, the grand-uncles of King Wu of Zhou. They led a portion of the Han Chinese southward from Shaanxi, passing through Hubei to Jiangsu, and called themselves Gou Wu.</p>
<p>The so-called Minyue were descendants of Goujian. The Min became attached to Yue in the late Spring and Autumn period and to Chu during the Warring States period. Emperor Gaozu of Han enfeoffed them as the King of Minyue. Later, they moved to Jianghuai and lived among the Han Chinese. At the end of the Jin Dynasty, due to the Wu Hu rebellion, many Han Chinese returned south to Fujian, which greatly opened up the culture of Fujian. Some believe that the Min people were descendants of Aryans who migrated there, but this is not yet a settled conclusion. Guangdong was the ancient land of Nanyue. "Yue" and "Yue" were originally the same and were also called Baiyue. It was not until the Han Dynasty that they were pacified and Zhao Tuo was enfeoffed as the King of Nanyue. The Han Chinese first arrived in Yue during the Spring and Autumn period, with their destination being Panyu. When Yue was destroyed by Wu and Chu destroyed Yue, some remnants flowed in. Emperor Qin Shi Huang opened the Five Ridges and sent 400,000 soldiers. Later, Emperor Wu of Han pacified Nanyue and repeatedly moved its people to Jianghuai. As a result, the composition of the Yue people had long been mixed with the Han Chinese.</p>
<p>In present-day Fujian and Guangdong, there are so-called Hakka people, who have special customs and habits. But what is their origin? The Hakka people of Guangdong came from the North River and the East River. Those from the North River were the soldiers sent by the Qin Dynasty to conquer the area. Soon after, the Qin Dynasty was destroyed, and the soldiers remained in the area around present-day Daqing Ridge. The Han Dynasty summoned Tai Hou, the general of the Qin southern expedition, to Wu Pass, and left Qing Sheng to guard the southern border, hence the later name Tian Shou Ling. It is said that the soldiers at that time were the ancestors of the present-day Cantonese people. The Hakka people of the East River came later than those of the North River. They probably migrated south due to the Wu Hu rebellion at the end of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, settling in southern Fujian, and then moved to southern Guangdong because Zhang Shijie and Wen Tianxiang were driven out by the Yuan Dynasty at the end of the Song Dynasty. Their number now far exceeds four million.</p>
<p>The so-called Dan people, also known as Danhu, are still found in large numbers on wooden boats on the rivers and coasts of Fujian and Guangdong. According to various historical records, the Dan people are descendants of the pirate Lu Xun from the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Lu Xun was originally a Han Chinese, so the Dan people have Han Chinese elements. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, Zhang Shijie and others led an army of 170,000 people, 300,000 militiamen, and 10,000 Huai soldiers to Yamen in southern Guangdong. Later, they were pursued by Yuan soldiers and dispersed east and west, wandering at sea. This is also one explanation for the origin of the Dan people. Another theory is that the Dan people were black people from the Indochina Peninsula who migrated to the coast of Guangdong. In short, the Dan people are a kind of rootless ethnic group in Guangdong, and their origin can be said to be multifaceted.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Yao people are no longer traceable. Most of them are distributed in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Yao people of Guangdong also came from Guangxi, and their original population was very small. From the Song to the Ming Dynasty, they increased to hundreds of thousands, living in the mountains near Lianshan. The largest number of Yao people are in Guangxi. There used to be a saying, "Four-tenths are people, six-tenths are barbarians." During the Ming Dynasty, Wang Shouren raised troops to suppress and pacify them, and they began to submit to the Han Chinese. The Zhuang people are scattered throughout Guangxi, divided into "raw" and "cooked" types. Their deeds are only found in various records from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, and their ancient ancestors are no longer traceable. In addition, there are two other types of people, the Fan people and the She people, who are also branches of the Yao people. The former are distributed in the northwest of Chaozhou in Guangdong, and the latter are distributed in Tingzhou in Fujian. There are also 200,000 She people in Kuocang Mountain in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>The Li people on Qiongya Island are now well known. The Yao people are divided into several different types, including Li, Qi, and Cun. The Li people are also divided into "raw" Li and "cooked" Li, living in places such as Wuzhi Mountain. The Li people are naturally simple and honest, and not like barbarians. They are probably ancient Han Chinese left behind here.</p>
<p>The Luo Luo are also a well-known ethnic group in the south, also called Guo Luo, Lao Luo, Lu Lu, and Liao Liao, and also called Manzi. There is also a name "Independent Luo Luo," which was added by Western ethnologists in recent times. This is because they are not controlled by Chinese political forces and have become an independent group. As for their origin, some say they are a type of Miao people, while others say they migrated from the border area of Tibet and Myanmar. Judging from their customs and habits, the former theory is more appropriate. The Luo Luo are distributed in a wide area, as far west as Kangding, as far south as Simao, and as far east as Guizhou, with Jianchang in Sichuan as their center. They are also divided into "raw" and "cooked" types. The "cooked" Luo have now mostly been assimilated with the Han Chinese.</p>
<p>The Miao people have the earliest origin, as mentioned in the Book of Documents. There are many names for the Miao people, and their surnames include Song, Cai, etc. According to the region, they are divided into Bazhai, Gaopo, Xixi, etc. According to clothing, they are divided into Qing, Hua, Bai, Hei, Dujiao, and Duanqun, etc. Their distribution area is: the Red Miao are located at the junction of Hunan and Guizhou, with the area near Tongren as the center. The White Miao and Qing Miao are distributed in central Guizhou and the Jinsha River in Yunnan. The Black Miao are also called the Raw Miao and are distributed in Liping and Duyun. The Flower Miao are near Guiyang. In short, the distribution of the Miao people is centered in Guizhou and extends to Guangxi and Yunnan.</p>
<p>The Bai Yi are similar to the Lao and Siamese people and are descendants of the former Nanzhao Dali Kingdom. They now exist in southern Yunnan. The Xifan are a branch of the Tibetan people, living in the Xikang Special Region and distributed in northwestern Sichuan and the border of Sichuan. Other Nu Yi, Lisu, Mo Xie, and Minjiazi are all distributed in southern Yunnan, and the Zhong people are distributed in the Zhaotong area of Guizhou. These are some small ethnic groups, mixed with the Xian Luo, Miao, and others, and their origins are not easy to trace.</p>
<p>Looking at the origins of the above ethnic groups in general, they probably have two sources: one is that they migrated from the so-called Central Plains in ancient times, and the other is that they migrated from overseas. According to world anthropologists, the races of the world (referring to the Eastern Hemisphere) probably all originated from the plateau of the Caucasus and the Pamir Mountains. Then, it goes without saying that the various ethnic groups in southern China, whether they came from the mainland or from overseas, all originated from the Pamir Plateau. At the same time, according to the above, we also see that the various indigenous ethnic groups in the south have been greatly assimilated by the Han Chinese through the cultural and political influence of past dynasties, especially in recent decades. If we can actively promote education and develop wasteland, I think that soon there will be no difference between the various southern ethnic groups and the Han Chinese.</p>
<h3>How to Live a Traveling Life</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>As the ancients said, "Heaven and earth are originally an inn, and life is like a passing traveler." This saying is very appropriate as a motto for travel enthusiasts. In this way, the first thing to pay attention to in travel life is a perpetually joyful state of mind! If you think, "Alas, the road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to heaven!" "Trampling east and west, eventually becoming a ditch," "Wading is very hard, and pedestrians stop," then why not sit at home and not suffer this unwanted sin? Moreover, in reality, this kind of mentality is extremely wrong! Therefore, if you plan to visit famous mountains, great rivers, strange caves, and scenic spots, you must always maintain a consistent optimistic attitude and persevering spirit. You must never give up halfway, nor can you force yourself to be perfunctory, making the fun become tedious—first, you must have a mind like the sea and the sky, like leisurely clouds and wild cranes. Dream that everywhere is your hometown, feel the wonder at any time, taste the harvest from the hardship, and explore the purpose from the difficulty. This is the first essential to correct the mentality in the process of travel life.</p>
<p>The correction of mentality can be said to be not much noticed at present, right? Because transportation is convenient, it is indeed advancing a thousand miles a day! It can not only enable people to actually enjoy the miraculous shrinking of the earth, but also enable people to live in peace and eat well, feeling comfortable everywhere, which will often make travelers naturally change their fearful mentality and encourage courage instead. However, in what I have experienced and seen, I have also found many regrets: for example, some people think that because Mount Lu, famous for its high rocks and winding paths, actually has a mountain road for cars on the side of Haihui Temple, they can infer from their mentality and one-sided views that Mount Lu, which is difficult to see its true face, does not need straw shoes and shorts. Just walking slowly in a car, you can see everything. Indeed, there are several friends of mine who underestimate Mount Lu too much. They wore clothes that were very unfavorable for walking: the female companions were naturally high heels and cheongsams. When they arrived at Haihui Temple, they looked casually at the layers of peaks and ridges of Mount Lu, and felt that there was no way to pass through, and they could not help but feel a lot of disappointment. Some people flipped through travel guides, and although they saw many special adjectives, they did not feel any deep interest. Looking up at the Five Elders Peak and the Daughter Peak, they only felt that the dangerous rocks and broken ravines must not have an easy path to climb at will, so they gave up their courage to explore the secluded and seek the strange. He is also like a pilgrim visiting Hangzhou, having been there dozens of times, but never carefully explored the caves or crossed the mountains. Except for the existing scenic spots outside the ready-made Lingyin Temple, Six Harmonies Pagoda, and Hupao, the good places hidden in the well-known inner mountains and outer mountains of West Lake, they have no way to inquire about! Therefore, in the current situation where transportation is convenient, in addition to correcting the mentality, there must also be a second essential for hunting for novelty and choosing the best.</p>
<p>Travelers are also like hunters and hunting dogs. When walking on the road, do not forget that there are still undiscovered paths hidden beside the road. There must be undiscovered miracles waiting for you to admire. Scenic spots cannot be based on other people's legends. Going there once as a matter of having already known about it is not enough. It is necessary to maintain an exploratory attitude that is new every day, to hunt for miracles from the ordinary, and to choose from the garbage-like famous monuments things that you think are worth appreciating. In order to maintain this spirit, we must turn from travel psychology to the scope of travel physiology.</p>
<p>For example, if someone is going to visit Mount Emei in Sichuan, it takes 60 miles of mountain road to walk from the foot of the mountain to the ridge, and it is necessary to change the climate of spring, autumn, and winter. If you are not prepared in terms of physiology, unless you do not plan to continue the journey, forced support will definitely affect your health. There is also an incidental fact that can be used as a lesson for travelers. Six years ago, a friend of mine with lung disease went to Guling, Mount Lu, to recuperate. I had already introduced him to a local friend to take care of</p>

<p>him up the mountain. However, because the sick man was eager to climb the mountain, he did not wait for his friend to take care of him, so he hired a sedan to go up the mountain by himself. That kind of sedan is just a rattan armchair tied to two hard wooden sticks. Without being informed that he was a patient, the porters did not care about the life or death of the sedan rider, and threw this friend with lung disease and heart failure like a basketball for dozens of miles. By the time he was thrown to Guling, he was already on his last breath. He was immediately sent to the hospital. After the doctor asked about the situation, he was greatly complained, and several injections of cardiotonics were ineffective. He died on the mountain in less than a week! This is such a sad thing! But in the past, whenever a patient went to Mount Lu, as long as they contacted the sedan company in advance, they could avoid this danger. They prepared soft sedans, and the sedan poles were not made of hardwood but of long, thick bamboo poles. They used bedding to tie up a bed-like soft pad, put the patient in the pad, and carried him very carefully by experienced porters, so that the patient could sleep to the top of the mountain like sleeping in a cradle, without feeling tired at all. This kind of soft sedan is most popular in the travels of Sichuan and Tibet, commonly known as a "sliding pole". Because travelers in Sichuan and Tibet live in towering mountains every day, it is necessary to arrange travelers in this way, especially people with heart failure, and it is necessary to take care of their physiological maintenance in all aspects.</p>
<p>As for the supplies that should be carried during travel, of course, many books and magazines about travel, as well as people who are experienced in travel, often announce it to people there. In my opinion, there are necessities and unnecessary things. Sometimes, in order to seek perfection, you often have to increase the weight of your luggage, which invisibly hinders the work of exploring and selecting scenic spots. There are also times when you miss an item, which will cause endless pain to people's psychology and physiology. I think that except for traveling overseas, most of them are climbing mountains and mountains, and most of the miracles and beautiful scenery are in deep mountains and dense forests, so I will especially mention some of the necessities for mountain travel to serve as a reference for those who live a traveling life.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that you can never wear leather shoes when climbing mountains. But ordinary rubber-soled basketball shoes will often have accidents. Because the soles of these shoes are extremely slippery when they touch water, it doesn't matter if you step on the mud, but on the way of climbing mountains, you often have to cross streams, waterfalls, etc., and the soles of these shoes often ask their owners to eat the pain of falling forward and backward, and even endangering their lives. I think if you are used to wearing straw shoes, grass shoes are the best. However, new leather shoes will cause blisters on the feet, so it is usually better to wear cloth-soled flat shoes! It's best to have them custom-made according to your own feet. In addition to shoes, medicines for first aid for minor injuries are the most important! Because breaking the skin and spraining, etc., this is almost a compulsory course in every trip. Gauze, cotton wool, band-aids, iodine ointment, balm, and turpentine, disinfectant skin-rejuvenating powder, Lysol or small pieces of potassium permanganate, etc., must be prepared in moderation. In addition, sewing needles and cotton are also necessary, because tearing clothes is also common; and the tear gets bigger and bigger, so it is better to sew it up quickly if you get a small place. Food is also necessary, "Carry dry food with you, and don't be afraid of being uncomfortable!" This is the essence of the motto of travelers.</p>
<p>Of course, other things depend on the traveler's own experience at any time. For example. a diary, etc., if you find something, write it down, or leave some handwriting in extremely desolate places, etc. In short, being able to solve psychological and physiological problems appropriately is the taste of traveling life.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Digest Monthly"</h3>
<p>— Gong Bi</p>
<p>Edited by Fudan University Digest Society, General Sales by Liming Bookstore</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese magazines have made significant progress in both quantity and quality; therefore, some people have hailed 1935 as the "Magazine Year".</p>
<p>Although Chinese magazines are gradually progressing, magazines that digest valuable articles from various magazines, such as Readers' Digest, have not yet appeared. I remember that two or three years ago, Mr. Liang Desuo edited a magazine called "Culture", which was of the nature of selecting good articles from national magazines and editing them, which had the flavor of a "magazine of magazines": however, Mr. Liang's work only reached the step of selection: In fact, specialized selection is not enough, we must further "shorten" it. It is very gratifying that the "Digest Monthly" is now taking on this task. Therefore, the appearance of the "Digest Monthly" is undoubtedly urgently needed and is a gratifying event in the Chinese magazine industry.</p>
<p>Magazines are important to a person, and magazines of magazines are even more important to the general public. A magazine reader must have a very high desire for knowledge, but no matter how superb his reading ability is, it is of course impossible for him to browse through the articles of various magazines, and he may not even need it completely. Most magazine readers are "busy people", and they usually have very heavy work every day. They can only flip through magazines when they are free from work. If they are asked to read a long article of several thousand or tens of thousands of words after extreme fatigue, they will not only feel tired, but also time will not allow it. If there is now a magazine that can indicate the valuable articles in national magazines to them and tell them the importance of a lengthy text in extremely short words, then how suitable is this magazine for the needs of readers?</p>
<p>In fact, the general public, whether they read books, newspapers, or magazines, their purpose is always to acquire a wide range of knowledge, and they do not want to prepare like scholars. Therefore, a magazine that can provide them with the important points of each valuable article, so that their reading time can be used very economically, is what they most urgently need at present.</p>
<p>The general public of readers sometimes encounters such a difficulty, that is, sometimes they find that there are one or two articles in a certain magazine that they want to read, and that magazine only has these one or two articles that they want to read. If they are to buy them one by one, it is very difficult for the economic capacity of the public. And the "magazine of magazines" can just remedy this difficulty.</p>
<p>The content and organization of the "Digest Monthly" are very novel, divided into five major columns: 1. General Discussion, 2. World Politics and Economics, 3. Relations between China, Japan, and the Soviet Union, 4. China's Past and Present, 5. General Academics. I think that at present, the "Digest Monthly" can pay special attention to the materials of the China-Japan-Soviet relations and the past and present of China, which has its own unique insights.</p>
<p>The "Digest Monthly" digests a wide range of content and is very rich, and almost all the articles in the magazines published nationwide are digested in it. It includes two major departments: social sciences and natural sciences. Social sciences include philosophy, sociology, history, politics, economics, etc., and natural sciences include engineering, physics, chemistry, etc. Therefore, the "Digest Monthly" is no different from a large melting pot, a library in magazines. It is all-encompassing, and it includes not only serious remarks, natural science papers, philosophical theories, but also relaxed and meaningful texts, giving readers every opportunity to choose.</p>
<p>I think that the "Digest Monthly" has a very fair attitude towards the standard of selecting magazine articles. It does not specialize in selecting articles from famous publications, nor does it rely solely on whether the author is famous or not. The texts it digests are completely based on whether the article itself is valuable. Because there are often many valuable articles in many non-famous magazines, and the works of many "unappreciated" authors do have a value worth reading. I think everyone who has read the inaugural issue of "Digest" will feel it.</p>
<p>In addition, the "Digest Monthly" has another feature, that is, the articles it digests, whether from the perspective of capitalism or from the perspective of socialism, as long as the argument of that article has its basis and reason, it puts it in front of readers, allowing readers to automatically criticize it and decide what to choose.</p>
<p>Because I feel that this kind of magazine, "Digest Monthly", has its advantages, I am happy to introduce it to readers. Naturally, the inaugural issue of "Digest" still has places that cannot completely satisfy people. I hope that the Digest Society can continue to work hard to "improve".</p>
<h3>Aphorisms</h3>
<p>— Shi Xiong</p>
<p>When someone stumbles, don't immediately erect a cross on top of it.</p>
<p>When the time is not yet ripe, don't brag or negate self-criticism first.</p>
<p>There is no way, the organism of mankind grows up while being poisoned, while completing the internal means for that poisoning. There is life in that. If you are dried up like a herring in your mouth, then there will be no poisoning, but there will be no growing up either, and there will probably be nothing at all!</p>
<p>The outer garment of love is taken off, leaving only the pursuit of sex.</p>
<p>What evil can't be done in seclusion? Laziness of spirit, aimlessness, is the abyss of all evils, and it is where villains are unscrupulous.</p>
<p>If water does not accumulate thickly, it can never carry a large boat.</p>
<p>If there is a kind of violence that "makes people inhuman", not only not as humans, but not even as cattle and horses; when people envy cattle and horses and sigh that "in troubled times, people are not as good as dogs in peaceful times", giving them a price slightly equal to that of human cattle and horses, then people will be sincerely convinced and congratulate the prosperous age. ——People are extremely easy to become slaves!</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Hollywood Event</h3>
<p>Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Chairman of Paramount's Service</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures, a Hollywood production company that has been established for 25 years and has many famous stars, held a grand banquet at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on December 1 last year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the company's chairman, Mr. Zukor's service. The initiators were all stars, such as Mary Pickford, Louis B. Mayer, Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Lloyd, Claudette Colbert, Katharine Hepburn, Carole Lombard, and William Powell, etc., with the stars shining brightly. On January 7, Mr. Zukor's 64th birthday, a banquet was held at the Paramount Company Colleagues Club.</p>
<p>However, since Paramount Pictures is unanimously screened in major cities around the world, the scope of the celebration is also global. The company has long planned to "perfect match", which is the first film to commemorate, starring Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy, scheduled for the 22nd of this month, the official founding day of the company, to be screened in major cities around the world, and in Shanghai, of course, it is the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>When the Grand Theater opens "Perfect Match" next Friday, Spencer Tracy will also appear on the screen at the same time in Washington, the capital of the United States, and New York and other important places. Mr. Zukor will personally go to Washington on that day to participate in the opening of that famous film. After the event, he will travel around the United States, accompanied by many Paramount Company employees.</p>
<h3>A Certain Man's Confession (6)</h3>
<p>— Original by French writer André Gide, translated by Xiang Shi</p>
<p>One morning, Marceline entered smiling at me.</p>
<p>"I've brought you a friend." Behind her, indeed, came a small Arab boy with dark reddish skin. He was called Basil, and his pair of calm, large eyes were fixed on me. I don't know why, but I felt somewhat uneasy, and this uneasiness made me weary. So I didn't answer a word, as if I were angry. The child, seeing my coldness, was embarrassed, and hurried to turn to Marceline, clinging tightly to her, grasping her hand, and kissing her exposed arm. I furtively saw that under his white robe and large cape, he was completely naked.</p>
<p>"Come! Sit here," Marceline, seeing that I ignored him, said to the child, "Just play quietly."</p>
<p>The child then sat on the floor, pulled a small knife from his large cape, and also took a piece of wood from the hood of his cloak. Thus, he whittled his wood. I guessed that he was probably going to make a flute.</p>
<p>After some time, I was no longer uneasy about his presence. I looked at him as if I had forgotten he was there. His feet were not wearing shoes, and the bracelet on his wrist was very beautiful. He used his "clumsy" little knife in a very skillful way. Really, was I interested in this? His hair was cut in the Arab style, and he wore a small round hat on his head, with only a small hole in the top of the hat. His robe was a little too large, revealing his lovely shoulders above it. I really wanted to caress them. I leaned forward, and he hurriedly turned to look at me. I gestured for him to give me the flute he was making, and I held it, looking very admiring. At this time, he was about to leave. Marceline gave him a piece of pastry, and I gave him twenty cents.</p>
<p>The next day, for the first time, I felt melancholy; I was waiting. What was I waiting for? I only felt idle and restless. Later, I couldn't bear it any longer:</p>
<p>"Isn't Basil coming this morning, Marceline?"</p>
<p>"If you want him to come, I'll go find him."</p>
<p>She left the words and went downstairs. But after a while, she still came back alone. What had illness made me become? Seeing that Basil didn't come with her, I almost shed tears.</p>
<p>"It's too late," she said, "School is already dismissed, and the children have all scattered. But it doesn't matter, you know there are many other lovely children, they are all familiar with me." (To be continued)</p>
