<p>（華東社）右翼我軍、因嘉興被敵猛轟、城垣俱毀、乍浦過份突出、難攻更且難守、故乍浦平湖兩據點、相繼退出、頃我軍堅守海盬·海寗·硤石·至長安石門崇德南潯之綫、與左翼取得密切聯絡、平望一點、亦向後移動、敵從王江涇輸送汽艇甚多、採行游擊戰術、有竄奪南潯杭州之勢、</p>
<p>（華東社）左翼敵連日猛犯福山蘇州、在常熟福山之間、一部份據點曾被突破、卒賴我軍英勇還擊、保持原有陣綫、從福山謝家僑南犯常熟城、經我猛烈反攻、已轉危為安、又京滬路正面中路猛攻正儀附近、我軍業將重要據點或予擊壞、或予據守、敵陰謀殊難實現、</p>

<h3>美國龔斯德博士致函忠告日本國民（下）</h3>
<p>捨正路而不由恐將陷於萬刼不復　侵略中國將被全世界人民所唾棄應　速悔悟勿受軍閥之愚免遭崩潰</p>
<p>我曉得你們對於中國之態度、不出於欺侮與畏懼途中國數年來之長足進步、是無可諱言的、你們素來是欺侮他們週甚及見其進步、乃又轉而為畏懼、惟此畏懼之一念、遂發生此次之用兵你們以為此時若不急起而制服中國、過了一時、中國太強、那就不可制服了你們所提以上許多理由、皆是空泛之談惟此乃為眞實之理由、你們要制服中國是很明顯的、</p>
<p>我以為你們欲制服中國、原有兩條路徑、一種是武力、一種是友好、現在你們已選用第一種了、這就是替你們自己結下、種永遠不解之大仇、你們或說“打倒中國使之無力抵抗、難有深仇亦何足慮一、但我對於你們此說實未敢相信、你們果能征服此四萬萬之大民族嗎、你們不要以印度為例中國與印度萬不能相提並論、英國雖失印度、尚不至有害於基本國生存、因英印相隔極其遙遠、至於中國、你們縱使今天能征服他、但若有一天中國能自強、則其力足以亡你們而有餘、因為你們與中國太接近了、且與中國比較、尤渺乎其小、</p>
<p>我深恐你們的軍閥、已經引導你們作一次狂賭、雖然你們目下或可倖勝、但他們引導你們所定的路、仍是一萬分之危險、又况你們的戰勝亦未可必、戰爭愈久、為禍必愈深、你們與中國之禍端、將一發而不可收拾了、</p>
<p>你們已經走錯了路程、你們本有走上共存共榮之大路、藉友好之關係、而得着幾乎不可計數之利益、你們的學校可以擠滿中國之學生、你們的工廠、可以充滿着中國之原料、你們彼此的缺乏、可以互相供給、可以互相挹注、但你們現正偏要製造以慘酷的環境、無論有形的戰爭與無形的戰爭、此種環境將继续而無了時、</p>
<p>你們已經走錯了路了、其結果只有悲哀、全世界對你們的態度也已改變了、同憶昔時亞東諸國、皆敬仰你們稱頌你們、並希望你們作他們的有力領導者、在他們眼中、以為你們是他們的保障、藉着你們可以避免西方人的侵略現在他們大失望血又大恐慌了因為你們自己在亞洲且開始大肆其侵呑與蠶食、你們已因時而失了領導者的資格、你們得之於前而失之於後、因為你們正在握着大刀刳下中國的肢體、你們本來可以得着全中國及全亞洲的心悅誠服、但因你們軍閥的黷武好戰、已將一切的着感都丟棄了、你們的生命腺是在於貿易、但你們萬不能強迫你們的仇、與你們作買賣、結果你們是把自己的刀、削斷你們的生命腺、</p>
<p>你們若說你們之所作是歐洲人所已作過的、我便回答說、集衆惡不足以成一着你們何必模做歐洲、目今日之歐洲、正足為你們用武力壓迫中國民族之鑒戒了、耶蘇救主說“提刀的的人必滅亡刀下”、今日歐洲之形勢、不可以作為此言之應驗嗎、數十年以前、歐洲人豈不是以武力向環球各部份大肆侵略嗎、今則此刀已回向歐洲人他們將滅亡於此刀之下、上帝是永在的、他們的正義的審判不問東西、亦不問膚巴、你們的國家、恐亦要崩潰於上帝之前呢、因為道德上之因果關係原是如此你們以不義種的收穫自然是不義以武力種的收穫自然是武力收穫的時間、不一定就在今日、也不一定就在明日、但上帝旣是永在這種因果律自然是無可倖免、</p>
<p>我寫了這種情感異常的信、實在是無任抱歉但我這信是寫與友人的、而措詞是包涵着無限的失望與悲傷我希望另有一個崛起的日本、來引導我們目前武人專政的日本、並不是我所夢想、所希望的不止如此、我是剛纔來住中國的、我看見中國無數的鄉民、由非武装的鄉村中被捕而去、我又看見許多鄉民、仰着天等待着如雨的機開槍彈、他們固然不願有此慘酷的待遇、而你們平民對於他們、也是絲毫沒有怨恨的可見此種行為、完全是不必要的、而亦是不可赦免的罪過啊</p>
<p>朋友啊、我切勸你們不要聽那種的宣傳、引導你們到了長期仇恨長期戰爭的苦痛你們寗可聽從你們遠見的政治家與中國友好你們趕緊回頭、再開始你們正當的路徑性質剛強的人能改過、性質過弱的人雖知過亦不肯改、請你們勉為剛強者、只要一轉移間、即可得人心之歸附了、你們以為太遲嗎這却未必、我最近曾與許多中國負責的要人談過、我相信只要日本肯伸出友好之手、他們一定以雙手來奉迎但以你們目前之態度而論、他們已預備抗戰到底、全世界的意見皆贊同中國　我不過發表此意見而已、你們或以為我說話太偏袒了、但你們須知我本不欲說話、這一篇不過是我無限傷痛之呼聲而且這一篇的言　、並不更激烈過我對於中國要人所說的、就是關於他們國家之弱點與罪過、而且我新從美國回來、凡在美國聽過我的言論的人、都曉得我對美國國家之罪惡、亦是明白指責、不稍寬恕、</p>
<p>我們每一個人都有缺點、但目前最重要的、就是在全世界的國際中有大罪案、即日本侵略中國之罪它是侵犯了中國、侵犯了全世界的和平、侵犯了你們自己的利益、且侵犯了你們與全世界一切的關係、回頭啊、望你們變成一個不走錯路的日本那末我們將跟隨你們的領導領受你們的賜與啦、但目前則無話可說你們對於中國之侵略一日不停止、則我們對於你們、無論其為文化為道德為精神為經濟、均無合作之可言我們今日係被迫而言此、我們之為此言、中心是無限痛苦無限切望、因為我們所說的、是對於朋友的忠告啊、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>當前的國際形勢與我國的外交路綫</h3>
<p>— 張志讓</p>
<p>日本擴大侵略中國已經造成了目前英美合作的形勢。這個合作是世界政治史上一件極端重要的事情。它變更了太平洋上四十餘年以來的局面，不斷地影響着歐洲政治的動向。</p>
<p>英國自從一八九四年與日本訂立協定以來，在遠東大陸上則聯日以制歐美列强，在太平洋上則聯日以制美。世界大戰以後，英美的對立日益加强，太平洋上美國與英日的對峙尤其顯著。美國雖然召集了華盛頓會議，訂立了軍備限制條約和九國關於中國事件的公約；使中日訂立了解决山東懸案條約：以全力使英日已滿期的同盟條約不再續訂，然而英國聯日的精神却直到蘆溝橋事變發生的時候還並沒有消滅。它始則對於滿洲事變拒絕與美合作，始終放任日本，繼則於李滋羅斯繞日來華之時，仍舊希圖妥協，最後到了蘆溝橋事變發生的前夜還在進行。對華的談判。直到上海戰事發生，中國全面抗戰開始，日木侵略全中國的野心已經暴露無遺，英國方才醒悟，放棄聯日制美的政策，改走聯美制日的途徑，在國聯相當主張正義，並且屢爲切盼美國合作的表示。</p>
<p>美國自從羅斯福接任總統。不久之後，就决定了少問外事專心解决內政的態度。在義阿戰爭及西班牙內亂的中間，更先後制定了中立法和永久中立法。到了中國全面抗戰開始的時候，美國正在孤立的最高峰上。不料在羅總統十月五日的芝加哥演說裏，就突然轉了方向表示願與各國合作，隔離國際不守法紀的疫癘，美國代表在九國公約會議裏面與英·法·蘇等國的主張大致相同。現在並且已與英國商定從事修正商約的談判。這些事實都表示了太平洋上英日聯合對美的局面已經變成了英美聯合對日的形勢。在舊的局面之下太平洋上已經運續發生了第一次的中日戰爭，日俄戰爭和滿洲事變以來的中日戰爭。這一些的大事件。這個局面的轉變當然要在這裹發生同樣重大的相反的影響。</p>
<p>不但如此，英美以及英美與法蘇的切實合作已經鞏固了國際和平的陣綫，加强了法蘇關係的作用，它一方面使列强聯合制日有實現的可能，另一方面使蘇聯積極助華的先决條件易於完成。因爲蘇聯要與我以積極有力的帮助，必須先得到英美的同意；否則，就恐怕一旦英美發生疑慮，反致兩受其害。現在英美合作對日的態度旣然已經相當明顯，它們贊成蘇聯這樣助我的可能當然甚大。這些都是我國在確定外交路綫的時候所應該特別注意的。</p>
<p>固然，美，英，法，蘇的合作促成了日，德，義三國防共協定的訂立，並且跟着這個協定又有英國駐義大使訪問義國外相商量兩國開始談判的問題。然而不久就發見這項談判還沒有到可以開始的時機。同時，英國又派樞密大臣哈立法克斯以私人行動的名義赴德，與希特勒元首談話至三小時之久。然而英德關於殖民地的矛盾德法關於中歐的矛盾以及英法對德關於西班牙的矛盾根本上都沒有圓滿解决的希望。英義關於地中海和東非的矛盾以及英法對義關於西班牙的矛盾也都如此。所以英國與德義妥協的可能實在甚少，和平陣綫破裂的危險幾等於零。况且如果雙方能夠彼此讓步而暫得妥協，那末减少歐洲的矛盾，使英國更有精力來對付遠東的問題也並不是一件不利於反侵略陣綫的事情。</p>
<p>至於美國則對於含有擴充法西斯勢力作用的三國防共協定更不會發生好感。南美各國的法西斯化爲美國之所切忌；就是歐洲各國的同化也是美國之所不樂聞。這就美國對於巴西政變的態度及它派遣駐法大使蒲力脫赴波蘭的事實來看，就很瞭然。</p>
<p>在如此的國際形勢之下，我國的外交應該一面善用美，英，法，蘇合作的傾向，以取得聯合對日的行動；一面推動英美贊助蘇聯爲更進一步的單獨援助；這是正當不易的路綫，還有什末疑問麼？</p>

<h3>浙江洋面天氣惡劣貢米運滬阻滯</h3>
<p>今明兩日首批當可抵埠　售價每市升規定八分半</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、與華南米業公司合作、採辦西貢洋米、調節滬市民食後、首批二萬五千包、巳裝嘉應輪、定今日午後抵滬、我國政府特准免稅進口、米號業昨日起、辦理繳款頒米手續、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>嘉應輪准今日抵滬</p>
<p>工部局與華南米業公司合作採辦之西貢洋米、總計十一萬五千包、每包重量二百二十磅、計一百九十八市斤、合一石二斗半、巳分裝外輪啟椗來滬、指定專供維持滬市民食之用、第一批二萬五千包、巳裝英商太古輪船公司嘉應輪、定今日（二十一）午後抵滬、在金利源碼頭卸貨、惟因昨日浙江洋面天氣惡劣、故或延至明晨（二十二日）抵滬、第二三四批各三萬包、本月底以前可完全抵滬、</p>
<p>我國政府特准免稅</p>
<p>昨向糧食界探悉、此次華南米業公司與工部局合作採辦洋米、目的爲調節滬市民食、所賺之錢、充救濟難民之用、所以我國政府、特准免稅進口、至於首批洋米二萬五千包、分配辦法、一·萬包歸米號業公會會員米號零雜、五千包歸救濟機關救濟難民之用、今米號業公會規定、公共租界三百家、法租界二百家、辦理零雜、每家各得四十包、價格零雜每市斤八分半、每人限購一元、</p>
<p>公會通告領米手續</p>
<p>米號業同業公會、昨通吿辦理會員米號領米手續如下、㊀繳款日期十一月二十日（星期六）起、至二十一日（星期日）爲止、㊁付款地點四川路二百七十六號中國銀行、㊂米款繳足後、由銀行發給提貨單務請各自注意所繳米款與提貨單是否相符、並與中國銀行商妥、今日雖爲星期日例停、爲特別通融起見、繳付米款、照常辦理、</p>
<p>米號領取貢米價格</p>
<p>米號業同業公會規定會員領取貢米價格、第一批二萬包、㊁碼頭交貨、每包國幣十六元一角五分㊁棧房交貨、每包國幣十六元四角五分、另加外費每包暫定二角五分、以前工部局存米領價、每包約合國幣十七元三角四分、此次價格略低、所以零關價格、亦由每市斤九分减爲八分半、</p>
<p>五百米店承銷零雜</p>
<p>首批西貢米抵滬分配辦法、决定以二萬包、由米號業公會會員米號零雜、五千包則作救濟機關維持難民食糧之用、現米號同業公共租界鄧仁泰等三百家、法租界寶和等二百家、均巳憑公會登記發給之領米證、於昨日開始向中國銀行繳款、各號可領米四十包、每家每日分四包、售價悉照公會議定、每市斤八分半、每人限購一元、聞將來全市一千五百家米店、一律照兩租界當局規定之市價出售、每市升規定八分半、將來尚預備抑低米價、俾民食充足無慮、</p>
<p>嚴防米店屯積居奇</p>
<p>自滬上米糧、曾一度發生不敷情形後、以事關民食、各方極爲注意、咸猜疑有若干米店、曾屯積大批米糧、待價而沽、故租界當局、對此項問題、異常重視、而法租界方面、每日派有中西探捕數名、分赴界內各米店搜查、現捕房認眞防範米商屯積起見、如路上有發現五斗米運送必詳查來源、若被查出有私售等情、决予嚴厲懲處、</p>
<p>調查人口分配食糧</p>
<p>法租界當局、爲顧全各捕房華人巡捕之糧食起見、特印製表格、向巡捕家庭中調查人口、預備分配食糧、並規定享此項權利者、祇限於妻子兒女、至父母及兄弟姊妹等、均不得享受、</p>
<p>法當局亦採辦洋米</p>
<p>法租界當局、每日派華探調查界內各米行號存米外、並嚴禁屯積居奇、一經查獲、决予嚴究並希望各界吿密、同時爲調節滬市民食起見、聞亦已向法屬安南、訂購鉅額洋米運滬、又在我軍未撤退前、由江浙運抵上海、停泊南市之米船、總約二萬石左右、自我軍撤退後、無法卸貨、今法當局及饒神甫、應各米業團體之請求、已向日方進行交涉放行、</p>
<h3>鎭海要塞封鎖期間德平定期開甬</h3>
<p>要塞司令部勉予變通　定二十四日啟航出口</p>
<p>本埠各洋商之寗波班輪、自十七日、經鎭海要塞司令部禁止通航後、太古公司之新北京輪、首先停班、改開溫州、而華義公司之德平輪、船票巳經出售、乘客亦多上船、該公司一再向鎭海當局請求、擬再開一班、結果未能照辦致該輪停泊滬上、巳經四天、公司派員到輪、向乘客退票、而乘客均不願退票離船、一致的表示願在輪上守候、以待至可以開行時、而往甬埠、亦所不計、該公司乃於昨日、再電寗波、請該埠商會、向要塞司令部磋商、可否通融、准德平輪將已經上船之甬籍同鄕難民、載送回籍、免得各難民困留滬上、至午後、該公司已得到甬商會復電、大致謂業將此意、轉達鎭海要塞司令、而王司令表示、已有首肯之意、准再通融一次但日期不能確定、大致在一四日中、聽候通知到會、再行電滬、啟掟赴甬、故德平輪昨日已將出口赴甬之結關手續、先行辦妥、一面通吿在船各乘客、靜候開船日期、如果星期一（即明日）能駛往最佳、萬一不及、則星期三定可開往寗波、據另一消息滬甬航綫、因我軍事當局封鎖鎭海海口、禁阻船隻出入、故均奉令停航、太古之新北京業經改航溫州、華義分司之恩德輪亦决改駛通州、惟德平輪因票已發售、且旅客多下船候開、不願退票、經再電甬要塞司令部請予變通、茲悉業蒙允准、該輪準於廿四日開甬、已購船票、一律通用、惟今晨先開行通州一次、是以昨已開始售票、大菜間十五元、官艙八元、房艙五元、大統艙三元五角、小統艙一元三角、台格舖四元、至於日前售票之滬甬綫客票、各旅客可向該公司照原價取回、華義公司昨特在門首張貼通吿云、德平輪接據甬電、准下禮拜三（即廿四日）開甬、各客請於下禮拜三上船、已購船票、照常通用、不去者可將原票退還船資、特此通吿、至滬甬交通、不轉舟山原因、以如不經鎭海、雖可直駛穿山、由彼取道寗穿公路達甬、惟行駛滬甬間航輪、如太古之新北京、華義之恩德及德平、因吃水太深、祇能駛至定海不能直達穿山、故自定海至穿山一段水程、尚須用小輪接續、旅客不便滋多、此亦華義公司暫時放棄滬甬綫航行之原因也、</p>
<h3>世界航輪陸續來滬</h3>
<p>戰爭西移後、滬埠緊張之狀態、逐漸消減、英商太古藍烟囱公司、昨晨有第一艘世界班輪Glengarry號進口抵滬、載運客貨、並聞二十四日續有第二艘世界班巨輪Sapredon號到滬、二十六日有第三艘巨輪Dencalion號進口、貨單巳先抵滬、數額極少、兩輪均不滿百噸、與平時每次載貨二三千噸者、相差極鉅、可知中外貿易、受戰事影響、致一蹶不振云、</p>
<h3>連日大潮浦水上陸</h3>
<p>低窪之地　盡成澤國</p>
<p>本埠最近數天、運日大潮、華租界各處低窪之地、盡成澤國、昨日尤甚、下午一時許、至晚六時間、租界方面、沿黃浦一帶、水均上陸、更以新關碼頭南首、地址較低、水深及尺、且因東北風甚猛與黃浦江連成一起、巨浪滔天、幾成一片汪洋、其他各處、如四川路·江西路·北京路·四馬路（即福州路）大新街口·南京路先施永安兩公司門口·至小花園一段、水深過膝、而陰溝內潮水倒灌上陸、無異地底蛟龍、不可遏阻、法租界菜市街東西自來火街等各處、水勢亦盛、不亞於公共租界、閘北方面、蘇州河北、自天后宮橋朝西、沿河經盆湯弄橋·老閘橋·老垃圾橋·至新垃圾橋、最低處水深不下三尺、以故該處店舖行棧住民等、均在水中生活、北浙江路·海寗路·各低下處、亦均有積水深者過膝、淺者沒踝、第一特區地方法院南面、有空地一大塊、積水成渠、新垃圾橋迤西、華界光復路交通銀行倉庫後背之荒地、及該處沿河、亦與蘇州河連成一起、新閘橋西擺渡口、經舢舨厰新橋至潭子口等、亦皆上陸、此次大潮、實爲近年來所罕見也、</p>
<h3>美敎士規戒藍金</h3>
<p>勿作抨擊奇離言論　輔助遭急難之中國</p>
<p>自中日戰事發生後、外人多仗義發表公正之言論、載諸西報、但亦有坐井觀天之輩、作落井下石之舉、乘機抨擊中國當局、如日前有美敎士藍金氏Rankin者、竟藉我政府拒絕敎會學校立案一事、投函字林西報、牽涉中日戰事、大發抨擊中國離奇之言論、日昨該報復載有署名美敎士之投函、規戒藍金氏、足徵公道自在人心、一二人之私見、終不能逃公論之駁斥也、函曰、十一月十六日貴報所載藍金氏之投函、涉及中政府對基督敎學校之態度者、曾引起鄙人之注意、鄙人亦爲敎士、對於此君所述之一切、實不願附和、如鄙人所得之消息果確者、其人必爲孤立之敎士、僅自吹自擂而巳、鄙人屬於有敎士百人之敎會、且爲與敎士五百餘人有關之某團體職員、此輩敎士、什九不贊同藍金氏之言論、其懇切與鄙人相同鄙人不得不感覺、凡自視爲中國之友者、在此時提出此類事件實爲離奇之舉、深望吾輩中國之友、相信極多數之敎士心中、皆不存如藍金氏所持之態度、且將竭其力之所能、於中國今日遭遇急難之際、予以輔助云、</p>
<h3>內地交通梗阻滬通航運擁擠</h3>
<p>沿江交通唯一孔道　外籍輪隻加班行駛</p>
<p>淞滬戰局轉變後、上海與內地之陸路及內河航路交通、發生阻碍、留居滬上之內地民衆、欲離滬返鄕者、殊感不便、所有一切航路交通、胥賴外籍輪船公司維持疏通、故連日各外籍輪船、由滬開出者、莫不滿載乘客、其中尤以滬通綫輪船、更見擁擠、蓋京滬綫一帶居民返籍者、均由滬乘輪至南通州、再渡至鎭江或南京、然後轉赴各目的地、是以太古之新北京、華義之恩德等輪、所有客貨運、莫不擁擠逾常、</p>
<p>又訊、滬埠自時局緊張陸路交通梗阻後、滬甬滬通兩航綫、爲唯一之重要交通、今滬甬綫又奉令暫行停航、因此滬通綫客貨驟增、行駛該綫之外輪、除英商太古之蕪湖武穴、怡和之平和同和外、義商華義公司德平輪、巳加入行駛該綫、</p>
<h3>海關行政保持現狀</h3>
<p>據路透社可靠消息　日方不至再有行動</p>
<p>中央社上海二十日路透電、路透社茲自可靠方面探悉日方不至採取進一步行動、以破壞中國之海關行政、查中國海關緝私艦隊之在上海者、以及濬浦局之挖泥船一艘、最近均已爲上海日本當局截留、惟鑒於中國海關之國際性、以及關稅之作爲庚子賠款、及外債抵押品者、範圍極廣、故日本當局之行動、在若干方面、均極爲關心、惟亦有認日方之舉動、係完全暫時性質、或不至再採取進一步之行動、以破壞此重要機關、亦不至以担保償付外債之稅收、提作別用也、至上海之濬浦局、亦爲受一九○五年及一九一二年國際協定統制之機關、該局之職務、爲維持黃浦江之航道、與各國船隻之便利關係極大而日本亦屬上述諸國際協定簽字國之一云、</p>
<h3>恢復遠東航綫大來正加考慮</h3>
<p>美進出口商一致要求　短時期內可恢復運輸</p>
<p>滬戰後、美商大來輪船公司遠東航輪、爲避免危險起見、暫吿停止駛滬、致美國商品無法輸華、我國土產亦不輸往、美進出口商大受影響、統計此三月來、美商所受損失之大、難以詳細統計、茲因滬戰內移、滬上危險減少、兵險費亦已大減、故美商紛向該公司、請求恢復上海綫、以恢復運輸、聞該公司已在考慮中、不久可望實行、聞我國著名土產、如桐油等、最受美國廠家歡迎、美方已迭次電滬催運、</p>
<h3>意大使訪松井</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、駐華意大使柯拉、昨日（十九日）下午赴日大使署武官辦公處、訪問上海區日軍總司令松井、昨晚六時日軍司令部發表公報、謂意大使之訪問、乃非正式性質云、按外交官訪問松井者、以意大使爲第一人、</p>
<h3>英駐華艦隊司令李德爾昨離滬</h3>
<p>視察防務短期內卽返</p>
<p>英國駐華艦隊司令李德爾中將、於昨日午後一時三十分、搭旗艦肯白倫號離滬、李氏此行、乃係視察防務、最短期內卽回、別無何種使命、</p>
<h3>浦東已有輪渡</h3>
<p>聞係商辦性質　每次大洋三角</p>
<p>浦東凌家木橋碼頭、（即洋涇賈家角渡口）與公共租界五馬路碼頭、昨日開駛商辦輪渡、每次由拖輪一艘、拖帶木駁船兩艘、自晨間七時起、至午後四時止、無定時往返載客、每次每客渡資大洋三角、由俄人兩名收取、昨日來往渡客、均係菜販浦東居民稀有發見云、</p>
<h3>浦東英美烟廠開工</h3>
<p>男工一千名　已進廠整理</p>
<p>英商顧中烟草股份有限公司（即英美烟廠）所屬浦東楊樹浦工廠、自滬戰爆發後被迫停工、公司爲救助失業工人起見、分期發給臨時救濟費、今鑒於滬市秩序漸吿恢復、决先籌劃浦東工廠開工、業已派定機器銅匠印刷等三間男工約一千名、每晨六時、由滬西專輪駛浦東該廠碼頭、進廠整理一切、當晚五時登原輪返滬西、該項工人均穿公司規定之黃色制服、俟整理完竣、即行正式開工、該廠男女工人總約四千名、出品爲大英·老刀·天橋·仙女·前門等牌捲烟云、</p>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>英美互惠商約談判</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>英美兩國締結互惠商約的初步接洽。已有相當成就。據英相張伯倫美國務部長赫爾日前宣稱正式談判不久就要開始了。又據加拿大及澳洲聯邦政府方面分別表示。英屬各自治領也將與美國商訂商約。英美兩大民主國在世界經濟上一向處着領導的地位。當此世界遭受着戰爭威脅的時機。兩大國在經濟上鞏固了相互的維繫也就可以奠定政治合作的基礎。這一事件。誠然如紐約時報所說。無疑地會在世界各處。發生安定時局的影響的。</p>
<p>現在單就遠東方面所可受到的影響來檢討一番罷。英美日在遠東市塲素來成着鼎足之勢。而日本近年的侵略行爲。其根本的動機。除了要撲滅中國新興的民族工業以外。就是要奪取英美的市塲。可是日本的經濟機構本不健全。再加上了侵略戰爭的重負。只有促成經濟的崩潰罷了。日本要從武力的途徑來達到經濟的目的畢竟是一個迷夢。現在英美兩强對於日本的侵略戰爭。似乎還不能加以有效的制止。其實英美對日的軍備競爭正在步步加緊。而這次英美要用締結互惠商約的手段將兩國的經濟勢力團結起來。在對於遠東局勢的政治作用上尤其有着深長的意義。因爲經濟政治和軍事原是三位一體。互相聯繫的。日本報紙評論英美商訂互惠商約事。認定這是民主集團對付締結反共公約諸國的行動。可見軍國主義日本的確感覺到相當的壓力了。</p>

<h3>Our Army in Jiaxing Retreats to New Position</h3>
<p>Main Fighting Forces Deployed on the Sujia Road Front; We Still Maintain Original Front Lines Between Changshu and Fushan</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Due to strategic considerations, our army in Jiaxing retreated to a new position on the afternoon of the 18th. A portion of the enemy forces entered the city at 3 PM. The main fighting forces are deployed on the Sujia Road front. Our fresh troops continue to arrive and will actively counterattack. According to the enemy's Taipei broadcast, the enemy force occupying Jiaxing is the Kataoka unit. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Huadong News Agency) The enemy's fierce bombardment of Jiaxing on the right flank destroyed the city walls. Zhapu was overly exposed, making it difficult to attack and even harder to defend. Therefore, the strongholds of Zhapu and Pinghu were successively abandoned. Currently, our army is firmly defending the line from Haiyan, Haining, and Xiashi to Changan, Shimen, Chongde, and Nanxun, maintaining close contact with the left flank. The Pingwang point has also been moved backward. The enemy is transporting many speedboats from Wangjiangjing, adopting guerrilla tactics, and threatening to seize Nanxun and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>(Huadong News Agency) The enemy on the left flank has been fiercely attacking Fushan and Suzhou for days. Some strongholds between Changshu and Fushan were breached, but our army bravely counterattacked and maintained the original front lines. The enemy attacked Changshu City from Xiejiaqiao in Fushan to the south, but after our fierce counterattack, the situation has turned from danger to safety. Furthermore, on the central section of the Jinghu Road front, the enemy fiercely attacked the vicinity of Zhengyi. Our army has either destroyed or defended important strongholds, making it difficult for the enemy's conspiracy to succeed.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Current Situation in Towns South of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Since the enemy troops landed at Jinshanwei, towns south of the Huangpu River have fallen, disrupting transportation and leading to isolated news and varying reports. A person who walked from the south of the Huangpu River to Shanghai gave a detailed account of the current situation in the area, stating that after the enemy troops landed on the coast, they divided their forces to advance on Songjiang, Jiaxing, and other places. The route into Songjiang followed Zhangyan, Tinglin, and passed the Mishi Ferry (a newly built highway), causing considerable damage to Zhangyan and Tinglin. Tinglin town was eighty to ninety percent destroyed. The enemy troops who landed on the beach must have rested in Tinglin, where they likely set up a command post or supply station. Songyin and Zhangze suffered less damage, and enemy troops are currently stationed in these two places. On the 6th, about fifty or sixty enemy soldiers from Tinglin arrived in the town of Yexie, which is located on the banks of the Huangpu River. At that time, our army had rushed from Nanqiao to intercept them, resulting in a battle at the Niu Cai Garden area about three miles from the town. Later, our army was ordered to retreat, so the battle stopped in a few hours. The enemy also did not occupy the town, considering it not a strategic area. However, enemy aircraft dropped bombs once, fortunately falling into the river. To date, the town is unharmed. Generally, people have gradually returned to the town, seeing that it is relatively stable. Desheng Port Town is a key entrance in the Huangpu River. Currently, an enemy shallow-water warship is stationed in the river to defend it. Enemy transport ships and boats pass through here every day. The person who came to Shanghai on foot from Pudong said that towns along the way south of Zhangang had not suffered from the war and were mostly intact. The areas to the north were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, and due to the rise of hoodlums in Puxi, theft was rampant. Residents flocked to Pudong, because the enemy troops in Pudong had all left, making it relatively peaceful. Near Shanghai, farmers along the way carried vegetables across the Huangpu River to sell, because all the enemy troops had gone to the front lines, and there was not a single soldier there, so there was no obstruction. As for Songjiang, the bombing within the city was very severe. According to eyewitnesses, from the Zhuganhui Electric Light Company, one could look directly to Bailongtan without any obstruction. The essence of the area was completely in ruins. The areas bombed were more intense to the west. To the east, to Huayang Bridge, there was no major damage, only a small wooden bridge on the Songhu Highway at the east entrance of Huayang Bridge Town was destroyed. Although other areas were occasionally hit by bombs, the damage was minimal, not as severe as rumored. Residents have all evacuated to the countryside, and there is no sign of life in the city or outside, like entering a dead market. There are many corpses on the roads from Songjiang along the highway to Shanghai, a truly tragic sight.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Arrive with Large Quantities of Munitions</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) On the evening of the previous day and the morning of yesterday (20th), four enemy transport ships arrived in Shanghai: the No. 308 transport ship Misakisan Maru, the unknown number transport ship Chojusan Maru, the Nijiri Maru, and the unknown No. 65 transport ship. They docked at the Huangpu Wharf, the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, Floating Dock No. 6, and the China Merchants Bureau China Wharf, carrying munitions. The No. 418 transport ship Jinno Maru, which sailed to Shanghai on the 19th, is currently docked at the Huangpu Wharf, unloading dozens of cars.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) At 8 AM yesterday morning (20th), the No. 374 transport ship Ginyo Maru, converted from an enemy merchant ship, sailed to Shanghai, carrying approximately 1,000 soldiers from the 12th batch of the enemy's seventh reinforcement army. They landed at the Osaka Wharf.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The number of enemy warships in the Huangpu River increased again yesterday. In addition to 16 transport ships, the number of destroyers increased to nine, currently docked at Floating Docks No. 44, No. 40, No. 9 (two ships), No. 8, No. 7 (two ships), No. 5, and No. 1. Three gunboats are docked at the Mitsubishi Wharf, the New Mitsui Wharf, and Floating Dock No. 15. One torpedo boat is docked at the China Merchants Bureau China Wharf, and three cruisers, totaling 16 ships.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) At around 8 AM yesterday morning, two enemy cruisers, the Kuma and the Ohoki, sailed to Shanghai, docking at Floating Docks No. 10 and No. 12. Including the enemy flagship Izumo, the number of enemy cruisers that sailed to Shanghai has increased to three.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops in Pudong Transferred to the Front</h3>
<p>Due to the tense military situation at the front, the enemy's motorcade defending the Pudong area had already transferred part of its forces to the front lines for reinforcements. Last night, they were ordered to transfer another part, carrying supplies and weapons, urgently via the Yangjiadu ferry crossing. They crossed the river in boats to Nanshi, where they transferred to heavy trucks to rush to the front. There was chaos on the Pudong Avenue, which only returned to its original state after two or three hours. Currently, less than one-third of the soldiers remain in Pudong, stationed in the Pudong Bank, Shudetang Chinese Medicine Store, Chenmin Elementary School, the Wu family alley, the Wu family, and the Tianzhang Paper Factory. The lower-level command post is located in the Chen family, a wealthy household in Yangjiazhai. Another team of military police is stationed in the Pudong Li neighborhood on Dongchang Road to assist in surveillance. However, with a force of less than 300, the distribution of defense duties is becoming increasingly difficult. As of this morning, there were no signs of the enemy east of Pudong South Road and the Jiu'an Cemetery Jinjia Lane area. Theft has risen sharply in nearby villages. The enemy, unable to cope adequately, is accelerating the training of 150 newly recruited puppet police, who have now formally stationed in the Pudong Branch, with plans to put them back on duty tomorrow morning (21st).</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Due to the tense military situation at the front, all the original enemy troops defending the Pudong area have been transferred to the front for reinforcements. Pudong is now guarded by puppet Manchurian police, with six men per squad. Except for the squad leader, who is an enemy soldier, the rest are from Northeast China. The squad leader carries a box cannon, while the puppet Manchurian police have no firearms, only wooden sticks, and are assigned to various guard posts by the enemy. It is reported that due to the small number of personnel, there are no traces of enemy troops in the vicinity of Gaoqiao Town.</p>
<h3>Enemy Establishes Supply Station in Minhang</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) After our army retreated from Nanshi in Pudong, both banks of the Huangpu River are controlled by the enemy. They are using waterways to transport grain and machinery. Enemy warships have been busy coming and going in recent days. It is also learned that the enemy has established a supply station in the Minhang area and occupied our Shanghai County government and other institutions in Beiqiao, storing large quantities of military equipment there before transferring it upstream. It is also learned that the enemy's headquarters is also located there.</p>
<h3>Our Small Ships Forced by Enemy to Transport Munitions</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The dozens of our small ships docked in South Huangpu, after being towed to the Mitsubishi Wharf and painted with numbers, have already carried munitions to the upstream of the Wusong River once. Yesterday afternoon, those small ships had already returned and are now docked on the Huangpu Wharf surface. The enemy ship Misakisan Maru, which has just arrived from Japan, is unloading its bullets into the small ships, preparing to head to the front again.</p>
<h3>North-China Daily News on the Citywide Refugee Problem</h3>
<p>Promoting the Resumption of Factories and Returning Refugees to Pudong Are the Most Important Ways to Alleviate the Serious Situation</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, emphasizing the importance of addressing the refugee problem in this city. It stated that there are currently 126,000 unemployed and destitute people in the various shelters in this city, who must be supported for at least half a year. In addition, there are about 600,000 people who are dependent on charitable relatives and friends, but these relatives and friends are already in financial straits and will not be able to sustain them for long. According to a survey by the French Concession, there are a total of 48,000 homeless people in the concession who have no food or clothing. The Public Concession has not yet determined the exact number, but it is approximately 8,000. Usually, 185,000 people in the Public Concession rely on factories for their livelihood. Now that factories in the northern and western districts are gradually resuming work, they have absorbed 50,000 workers. There are still approximately 135,000 people without work, making life difficult. Fortunately, refugee groups are sending refugees back to their hometowns. If the refugees from Pudong who have come to Shanghai can be returned to their villages, it can reduce Shanghai's burden. Furthermore, they can grow crops to supply Shanghai, alleviating the food shortage in this city. The Japanese authorities are also aware of this need, but are hesitant due to concerns about guerrilla attacks. However, the residents of Pudong and the surrounding areas are not comparable to people from other provinces and pose no such danger. The relaxation of the unemployment situation in Shanghai will also benefit the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese should encourage the refugees of Pudong to return to their hometowns. After the number of refugees in Shanghai decreases, it will be possible to cope with the unemployed who have no hometown to return to and who call Shanghai home. However, even that is not easy. Another aspect that requires special attention is that if Shanghai's industry is to recover, the authorities must prevent skilled workers from leaving Shanghai due to prolonged idleness. The Labor Planning Committee of the Chinese and Foreign Yizhen Association is already concerned about this. In short, the refugee problem now requires the cooperation of municipal authorities and others and must be addressed with a spirit that is not afraid of difficulties.</p>
<h3>Zhu Yaohua Dies of Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>(Huadong News Agency) Zhu Yaohua, the commander of the □□th Division, who failed to completely defend the Dachang position, shot himself due to the enemy's breakthrough of the Dachang position, seriously wounding his left rib. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but did not recover after more than ten days. It is reported that he died of serious injuries, and all who heard the news expressed their sorrow.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Association Rescues War-Zone Children</h3>
<p>Reviewing the Outline of Rescue Methods; Subsidizing Street Children's Education</p>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association held its 103rd Executive Committee meeting yesterday at 12:30 PM. The attendees were Luo Yunyan, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Xiong Bingzao, Yan Fuqing, Li Denghui, Wu Weide, Chen Heqin, Zhu Lide, Mrs. Yang Ge, Ms. Liu Wang Liming, Ms. Xing Xiong, the general secretary Xu Jianping (represented by Chen Tiesheng), the deputy general secretary Chen Tiesheng, and the recorder Ding Bingnan. The meeting was opened by Chairman Luo Yunyan. General Secretary Xu reported on the association's affairs, stating that the China Children's Welfare Association of America had sent a telegram to President Kong of this association, suggesting that the construction funds for the Nanjing Children's Welfare Experimental Area be used for the expenses of rescuing Chinese war-zone children. President Kong has already replied that he agrees. Deputy General Secretary Chen Tiesheng was dispatched in June to the provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan to rescue disaster-stricken children. He cooperated with local government agencies and charitable organizations to establish 12 shelters in Sichuan, housing 5,000 disaster-stricken children, and five shelters in Gansu, housing 1,000 disaster-stricken children. He also entrusted the Xi'an Orphanage to house 300 disaster-stricken children. The shelter period is set for one year. In Shanghai, this association cooperated with the International Relief Association to rescue children in the Nanshi refugee area. The Shanghai War-Zone Children's Shelter is currently housing more than 170 children and needs to be expanded. The following motions were then discussed and passed: ㊀ The draft outline of rescue methods for war-zone children was referred to Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Yan Fuqing, and other committee members for review and implementation. ㊁ The China Children's Welfare Association of America's suggestion to transfer the construction funds for the Children's Welfare Experimental Area to the rescue of war-zone children was referred to Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, and other committee members, along with representatives from the China Children's Welfare Association of America, Baker and Fei Wusheng, for research and implementation. ㊂ The motion to expand the Shanghai War-Zone Children's Shelter and the Shanghai Children's Hospital's request for a subsidy, as well as the requests from the Children's Welfare Associations in Chengdu and Lanzhou for formal recognition, were referred to Luo Yunyan, Lin Kanghou, Wu Weide, Liu Shi Liming, and other committee members for joint review. ㊃ The Shanghai Street Children's Education Association is operating quite well, and this association subsidizes it with 100 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Eight Schools in the French Concession to Resume Classes Next Week</h3>
<p>Eight schools in the French Concession, including the French Concession Art School and the Youth Middle and Elementary School, were temporarily closed for a week because police officers and others were temporarily residing there. It is reported that the schools have found new locations and will resume classes next week.</p>
<h3>Two Elderly Men in Pudong Display Commendable Integrity in Their Later Years</h3>
<p>Threats and Inducements Fail to Move Them; The Puppet Maintenance Association Cannot Be Established</p>
<p>Since the enemy troops occupied the towns in Pudong, they have been eager to use local respected people for their purposes, in order to stage their puppet show, but they have repeatedly run into walls, so that many puppet maintenance associations in various places cannot be established. It is learned that Zhang Xuezhou of Zhoupu Town, nearly seventy years old, is usually enthusiastic about local affairs and is deeply respected by the local people. After the enemy troops occupied the town, they tried in many ways to persuade him to serve as the chairman of the maintenance association, but Zhang was unmoved. He quietly came to Shanghai a few days ago and told people, "I am a member of the Chinese people. Because of my old age and declining strength, I cannot serve in the war of resistance. How can I still be willing to be driven by the enemy?" Furthermore, Qin Yanqi, seventy-eight years old, of Chenxing District in Pudong, has served as a director of the Shanghai Charity Association and is a keen patriot who has been running social undertakings. The enemy admired his name and asked someone to persuade Qin to return, threatening to burn his house if he did not return. Qin heard of this and said, "If the country is not saved, what is the use of having a home? Let them do it." Such as these two elderly men, truly display commendable integrity in their later years.</p>
<h3>National Government Moves to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Declaration Issued Yesterday; Will Engage in a More Extensive and Protracted Struggle</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government recently issued the following declaration: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, Tianjin and Beiping have fallen, and the war has spread. The National Government, recognizing the endless aggression of the violent Japanese, decided to resist and defend itself. The people of the whole country, filled with righteous indignation, and all the officers and soldiers, loyal and courageous, rose up. The invaded provinces have all made extremely urgent efforts and extremely heroic sacrifices. In the corner of Shanghai, the war of resistance lasted for three months. Officers and soldiers from all over the country rushed to the aid, arriving in the evening after being ordered in the morning. They built trenches with their flesh and blood on the front lines, determined not to retreat. The violent Japanese poured out their sea, land, and air forces to attack in a continuous cycle. Although the positions were reduced to ashes, the morale of the army remained as solid as gold. The courage in the face of battle and the heroism of those who died in the line of duty truly demonstrate the spirit of national independence and lay the foundation for the revitalization of China. Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more greedy and sent troops westward, approaching our capital. Their intention is nothing more than to use their violence to force us into an alliance under the city walls. They do not know that from the day we decided to resist and defend ourselves, we knew that this was the final moment. For the sake of the nation's life, for the sake of the national character, and for the sake of international justice and world peace, we have no room to surrender. Anyone with blood in their veins is determined to be a jade shard rather than a broken tile. The National Government, in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in a long-term war of resistance, has moved to Chongqing today. From now on, it will engage in a more extensive and protracted battle with the masses of the Chinese people and the vastness of the land. Everyone is determined to die, and their blood and land will be united as one. No violence can separate them. With international sympathy from abroad and national unity at home, we can continue to resist and achieve the goal of maintaining the survival and independence of the nation. This is hereby declared, and we encourage each other. November 20, 26th year of the Republic of China (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Chengdu] The provincial government, upon hearing that the National Government moved to Chongqing on the 20th, sent a telegram of welcome. The original telegram read: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government: Upon reading our government's declaration, we know that in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in a long-term war of resistance, you have moved to Chongqing. This firm declaration shows the spirit of resisting the enemy. The re-establishment of the existing base and the winning strategy are ultimately in our own hands. Not only can we gain international sympathy, but also encourage the loyalty and love of the Sichuan people. After reading, we lead 70 million people to welcome you. Please accept our reverence. Liu Xiang, Deng Hanxiang (acting name), stamped with the Sichuan Provincial Secret Seal." (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The central government agencies have been moving successively, and today the transport is almost complete. All valuable equipment in the offices and factories has now been dismantled. Hospital equipment, factory lathes, and various machines have all been moved, so this city only has an empty shell left. There is no sign of civil unrest or collapse. The general public opinion among the Chinese people is that they are determined to resist to the end and are strongly opposed to surrender and compromise.

<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires Denies Japanese Newspaper's Report of Our Request for Mediation</h3>
<p>Our Embassy in the UK Also Firmly Denies This. British Ambassador to Japan's Meeting with Hirota Only Related to the Shanghai Situation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] This morning, British Chargé d'Affaires Archibald Clark Kerr, speaking to a Reuters reporter here, firmly denied the news reported in the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun that Nanjing dignitaries had requested him to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute and inquire about the Japanese side's ceasefire conditions, saying that this statement was absolutely unfounded. The British Chargé d'Affaires plans to go to Hankou soon to maintain direct contact with responsible personnel of the Chinese government. (Reuters, 20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Recently, foreign sources have released a message claiming that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, and certain important figures around Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, had requested the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Archibald Clark Kerr, to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. Upon hearing this, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK immediately and firmly denied it, saying that this was propaganda with ulterior motives. In fact, "this kind of action could never be done by such figures." Privately in China, it is said that the envoys of various countries stationed in China are eager to seize every opportunity to promote peace in the Far East, which the Chinese government is not unaware of. Among British diplomatic circles, it is said that "we know nothing about it, and even the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Archibald Clark Kerr, has not reported a single word about it," indicating that this news is not credible. (Reuters, 20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Reuters has learned that the talks between the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Horiuchi yesterday were only related to the current situation in Shanghai and did not formally discuss other matters. The British Embassy stated that the Japanese newspaper's report that the British Ambassador had indirectly expressed Britain's willingness to mediate in order to arrange direct Sino-Japanese negotiations was completely unfounded.

<h3>Dr. Gonser De Forest of the United States Writes a Letter of Advice to the Japanese People (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Fearing that Abandoning the Right Path Will Lead to Irreversible Calamity. Invading China Will Be Despised by People All Over the World. Repent Quickly and Avoid Being Fooled by the Warlords to Avoid Collapse.</p>
<p>I understand that your attitude towards China stems from nothing but bullying and fear. China's remarkable progress in recent years is undeniable. You have always bullied them, and upon seeing their progress, you have turned to fear. It is this fear that has led to this military action. You believe that if you do not take immediate action to subdue China, China will become too strong in the future and will be impossible to subdue. All the reasons you have given above are empty talk. This is the real reason. It is clear that you want to subdue China.</p>
<p>I believe that there are two ways for you to subdue China: one is by force, and the other is by friendship. Now you have chosen the first way, which is to create an eternal and irreconcilable hatred for yourselves. You may say, "Defeat China and make them powerless to resist. What is there to fear from deep hatred?" But I really dare not believe your statement. Can you really conquer this nation of four hundred million people? Do not use India as an example. China and India cannot be compared. Even if Britain loses India, it will not harm the fundamental existence of the country, because Britain and India are extremely far apart. As for China, even if you can conquer them today, if China can become strong one day, their strength will be more than enough to destroy you, because you are too close to China and are insignificant compared to China.</p>
<p>I am deeply afraid that your warlords have led you into a reckless gamble. Although you may win temporarily, the path they have led you on is extremely dangerous. Moreover, your victory is not certain. The longer the war lasts, the deeper the harm will be. Your conflict with China will become irreversible.</p>
<p>You have already gone down the wrong path. You could have taken the road of coexistence and co-prosperity, gaining countless benefits through friendly relations. Your schools could be filled with Chinese students, your factories could be filled with Chinese raw materials, and you could supply each other's needs. But now you are determined to create a cruel environment, whether it is a physical war or an intangible war, this environment will continue endlessly.</p>
<p>You have already gone down the wrong path, and the result will only be sorrow. The attitude of the whole world towards you has also changed. In the past, all the countries of East Asia admired and praised you, and hoped that you would be their strong leader. In their eyes, they thought you were their guarantee, and through you they could avoid the invasion of Westerners. Now they are greatly disappointed and greatly panicked, because you yourselves are starting to invade and encroach upon Asia. You have lost your qualifications as a leader because of the times. You gained it in the past but lost it in the present, because you are now holding a knife and cutting off the limbs of China. You could have won the sincere obedience of the whole of China and the whole of Asia, but because of the militarism and bellicosity of your warlords, you have abandoned all sense of gratitude. Your lifeline lies in trade, but you cannot force your enemies to trade with you. As a result, you are cutting off your own lifeline with your own knife.</p>
<p>If you say that what you are doing is what Europeans have already done, then I will answer that accumulating evil is not enough to make a good deed. Why do you have to imitate Europe? The Europe of today is a warning to you against using force to oppress the Chinese people. Jesus Christ said, "Those who live by the sword will die by the sword." Is not the current situation in Europe a proof of this saying? Decades ago, did not Europeans use force to invade all parts of the world? Now this sword has turned back to the Europeans, and they will perish under this sword. God is eternal, and their righteous judgment does not ask about East or West, nor does it ask about skin color. Your country may also collapse before God, because the moral relationship between cause and effect is like this. If you sow injustice, you will naturally reap injustice. If you sow violence, you will naturally reap violence. The time for reaping may not be today, nor may it be tomorrow, but since God is eternal, this law of cause and effect is naturally unavoidable.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to write this unusually emotional letter, but this letter is written to a friend, and the wording is full of infinite disappointment and sadness. I hope that there will be another rising Japan to guide us. The current Japan under the dictatorship of the military is not what I dream of and hope for. Not only that, but I have just come to live in China. I have seen countless Chinese villagers being arrested from unarmed villages, and I have seen many villagers looking up to the sky waiting for machine gun bullets raining down. They certainly do not want to be treated so cruelly, and your civilians have no resentment against them. It can be seen that this kind of behavior is completely unnecessary and is an unforgivable sin.</p>
<p>Friends, I urge you not to listen to the kind of propaganda that leads you to the pain of long-term hatred and long-term war. You should rather listen to your far-sighted politicians and be friendly to China. Turn back quickly and start your right path again. People with strong character can change their ways, while people with weak character are unwilling to change even if they know they are wrong. Please try to be a strong person. With just one turn, you can win the hearts of the people. Do you think it is too late? That is not necessarily the case. I have recently talked with many responsible Chinese leaders, and I believe that as long as Japan is willing to extend a friendly hand, they will definitely welcome it with both hands. But given your current attitude, they are prepared to fight to the end. World opinion agrees with China. I am just expressing this opinion. You may think that I am too biased, but you must know that I did not want to speak. This article is just a cry of my infinite sorrow, and the words in this article are no more intense than what I said to the Chinese leaders about the weaknesses and sins of their country. Moreover, I have just returned from the United States, and everyone in the United States who has heard my speeches knows that I also clearly criticize the sins of the American nation without any leniency.</p>
<p>Everyone has shortcomings, but what is most important at present is that there is a major crime in the international community of the world, that is, Japan's crime of invading China. It is an infringement on China, an infringement on world peace, an infringement on your own interests, and an infringement on your relationship with the whole world. Turn back, I hope you will become a Japan that does not go down the wrong path. Then we will follow your leadership and receive your gifts. But at present, there is nothing to say. If you do not stop your aggression against China for a day, then we will have no cooperation with you, whether it is cultural, moral, spiritual, or economic. We are forced to say this today. When we say this, our hearts are full of infinite pain and infinite hope, because what we say is a sincere advice to a friend.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Jiangsu Provincial Government for Approval to Purchase Vegetable Cattle in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday regarding the shortage of vegetable cattle in Shanghai. The cable reads: "To the esteemed Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government, previously, the Shanghai market for vegetable cattle was designated to be purchased from Wujin, Danyang, and Wuxian by your government. Later, due to the disruption of transportation, it was proposed to change to procurement from Rugao, Dongtai, Nantong, Taixing, Taixian, and Jingjiang. This has been submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Government for consultation. However, due to the current situation, documents are delayed, and the Shanghai market for vegetable cattle has been cut off. The situation is extremely urgent. It is requested that your government cable the above six counties to temporarily rely on the certificate of proof from the Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association for inspection and release to alleviate the immediate crisis. Awaiting a reply. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is Properly Planning Relief for Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>Dispatching to the Rear for Production in the Short Term</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, considering that after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, factories in the war zone were destroyed by artillery fire, and factories in the concession area were mostly unable to start work due to the war, resulting in a large number of unemployed workers being displaced, apart from the association finding ways to request the Municipal Relief Committee to send a portion back to their original places of origin, a large number of those remaining in Shanghai are currently being counted, and about 3,000 people have registered with the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee. The Federation of Trade Unions is currently working with the committee to properly plan relief, and plans to send the registered workers to the rear in the short term in order to introduce them to work and engage in production.</p>
<h3>The Wind is Tight,拂 Shanghai's Weather Suddenly Turns Cold</h3>
<p>The Huangpu River Continues to Have High Tides Today</p>
<p>The weather in this port has turned cold today, and the northeast wind is blowing tightly, and the robes are not warm. The Huangpu River flood season is also affected by the wind, and the tide is still very high today. Low-lying road surfaces and sewers are raising water and flooding the streets, making it difficult to walk.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Promote the One-Cent Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, There Were People Who Went to Pay</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee accepted the Shanghai Insurance Industry Service Corps's suggestion to promote the one-cent-a-day movement to relieve refugees. Since the start of the recruitment, all sectors have been actively implementing it. Yesterday, those who went to respond included 41 Chinese employees of the British-owned China Soap Company, each donating one yuan, and children Wang Miaorui and Pan Jinlin, each donating three yuan.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Stocks of Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>Since the change in the Shanghai situation, the disruption of water and land transportation has caused a shortage of various goods coming in. However, the reporter learned from the Chinese Medicine Industry Association that although many shops in the Nanshi medicinal materials industry have been destroyed, the various drugstores usually have sufficient stocks, so there is no cause for panic. Therefore, it will definitely not affect patients, and the selling price is also kept balanced with that before the war. Moreover, the consumption of some tonics and medicines has been sharply reduced, such as white fungus, which has fallen in price quite a lot. However, there is a slight shortage of herbal medicines, but it is currently sufficient to cope with the situation.</p>

<h3>The Current International Situation and Our Country's Diplomatic Line</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhirang</p>
<p>Japan's expanded aggression against China has already created the current situation of Anglo-American cooperation. This cooperation is an extremely important event in the history of world politics. It has changed the situation in the Pacific for more than forty years and is constantly affecting the movement of European politics.</p>
<p>Since Britain concluded an agreement with Japan in 1894, it has allied with Japan to contain the European and American powers on the Far Eastern continent, and allied with Japan to contain the United States in the Pacific. After the World War, the opposition between Britain and the United States intensified, and the confrontation between the United States and Britain and Japan in the Pacific was particularly significant. Although the United States convened the Washington Conference, concluded the arms limitation treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty on Chinese affairs, and enabled China and Japan to conclude the Shandong Question Resolution Treaty, it made every effort to prevent the Anglo-Japanese alliance treaty, which had expired, from being renewed. However, the spirit of Britain's alliance with Japan did not disappear until the July 7th Incident. It initially refused to cooperate with the United States on the Manchurian Incident, and always let Japan go. Then, when Lytton went around Japan to China, it still hoped to compromise. Finally, on the eve of the July 7th Incident, it was still conducting negotiations with China. It was not until the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the start of China's all-out resistance, and the exposure of Japan's ambition to invade all of China that Britain woke up, abandoned its policy of allying with Japan to contain the United States, and changed to the path of allying with the United States to contain Japan. It strongly advocated justice in the League of Nations and repeatedly expressed its eagerness for American cooperation.</p>
<p>Since Roosevelt took office as president, he soon decided to ask fewer foreign affairs and concentrate on solving domestic problems. In the middle of the Italo-Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War, he successively formulated the Neutrality Act and the Permanent Neutrality Act. When China's all-out resistance began, the United States was at the peak of isolation. Unexpectedly, in President Roosevelt's Chicago speech on October 5, he suddenly changed direction and expressed his willingness to cooperate with various countries to isolate the international outlaws. The American representative's views at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference were roughly the same as those of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is now also in discussions with Britain to revise the commercial treaty. These facts all show that the situation in the Pacific in which Britain and Japan joined forces against the United States has changed to a situation in which Britain and the United States joined forces against Japan. Under the old situation, the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Sino-Japanese War since the Manchurian Incident have continued to occur in the Pacific. This change in the situation will of course have the same major opposite effects here.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the practical cooperation between Britain and the United States, as well as between Britain and the United States and France and the Soviet Union, has consolidated the international peace front and strengthened the role of the Franco-Soviet relations. On the one hand, it makes it possible for the great powers to jointly contain Japan, and on the other hand, it makes it easier to complete the prerequisite for the Soviet Union to actively assist China. Because if the Soviet Union wants to give me active and powerful assistance, it must first obtain the consent of Britain and the United States; otherwise, it is afraid that once Britain and the United States have doubts, it will suffer both sides. Now that Britain and the United States' attitude toward Japan has been quite clear, their support for the Soviet Union to assist me in this way is of course very great. These are all things that our country should pay special attention to when determining its diplomatic line.</p>
<p>Of course, the cooperation of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union promoted the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and following this agreement, the British Ambassador to Italy visited the Italian Foreign Minister to discuss the issue of negotiations between the two countries. However, it was soon discovered that the time for this negotiation had not yet arrived. At the same time, Britain sent Privy Councilor Halifax to Germany in a private capacity to talk with Hitler for as long as three hours. However, the contradictions between Britain and Germany over colonies, the contradictions between Germany and France over Central Europe, and the contradictions between Britain and France over Spain have no hope of being resolved satisfactorily. The same is true of the contradictions between Britain and Italy over the Mediterranean and East Africa, and the contradictions between Britain and France over Italy over Spain. Therefore, the possibility of compromise between Britain and Germany and Italy is really small, and the danger of the peace front breaking down is almost zero. Moreover, if both sides can make concessions to each other and temporarily reach a compromise, then reducing the contradictions in Europe and enabling Britain to have more energy to deal with the problems in the Far East is not a bad thing for the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>As for the United States, it will not have any good feelings about the Anti-Comintern Pact, which contains the role of expanding fascist forces. The fascistization of South American countries is what the United States is most wary of; the assimilation of European countries is also what the United States does not want to hear. This can be clearly seen from the United States' attitude towards the coup in Brazil and its dispatch of Ambassador Breth to Poland.</p>
<p>Under such an international situation, our country's diplomacy should, on the one hand, make good use of the tendency of cooperation between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to obtain joint action against Japan; on the other hand, promote the United States and Britain to support the Soviet Union to further provide individual assistance; this is the correct and easy path, is there any doubt?</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Takes Precautions to Deal with the Crisis in the Far East</h3>
<p>Milan The semi-official "Italian People's Daily" here declared last night that the Moscow government had formally notified the Barcelona Republican government that Soviet Russia could no longer provide assistance to the Spanish government forces because it felt threatened by Japan and had the possibility of being involved in the Sino-Japanese War. The newspaper pointed out that this declaration indicates that the Soviet Union's supply of volunteers and military supplies to Spain will be suspended, and the Soviet Union's interest in the Spanish conflict will cool down. (20th, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Cecil Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>[New York] Lord Cecil, who won the 1937 Nobel Peace Prize, declared here today that economic sanctions against Japan by only a few countries would be enough to stop Japanese aggression. There are two bases for this: 1. Only a few countries buy Japanese goods, and 2. Japan only purchases raw materials from a few countries. Therefore, if several major countries can unanimously implement economic sanctions, they will definitely be effective. (19th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Washington] Democratic Congressman Lewis today introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to authorize President Roosevelt to prohibit the shipment of American arms and other military raw materials (except food) to Japan, and to jointly exert economic pressure on Japan with various countries to forcibly restore peace in the Far East. (19th, National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Pittman Expresses Disappointment with the Results of the Brussels Conference</h3>
<p>Washington Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman told Associated Press reporters today that he was quite disappointed with the results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, the Nine-Power Treaty does not expect to be as important as a treaty. As for the reason why the United States does not implement the Neutrality Act, it is because the purpose of the Neutrality Act is only to protect the United States, not to oppress other countries. As of now, the United States is not in danger of being involved in the whirlpool of the Far Eastern war. If there is such a development in the future, such as naval blockade and submarine attacks, then this law will be enough to protect the United States. Democratic Senator Lewis proposed that President Roosevelt investigate the situation of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and withdraw the American representative if necessary. (19th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[New York] "The Washington Post" recently published an article declaring that the Brussels Conference only condemned Japan's acts of aggression, which is really not enough. Democratic countries must take effective steps against aggressors. The report also pointed out that Britain, the United States, and Canada are currently supplying Japan with various materials, which Japan is using to invade China. Therefore, the United States must declare a boycott of Japanese goods and stop selling goods to Japan. The conservative "Commercial and Financial Chronicle" stated, "The Anti-Comintern Pact" and the Brazilian coup proved that fascism has attacked democratic countries. "Under the slogan of anti-communism, fascism is threatening democracy. The Brazilian fascist coup has a great impact on American interests." "The New York People's Forum" criticized the Brussels Conference, calling it an ineffective organization. (19th, Tass News Agency)</p>

(The initial meeting lasted ninety minutes. Talks continued during breakfast and after lunch, totaling three hours. German Foreign Minister Neurath was also present. Later, Halifax and Neurath traveled by train to Munich. After half an hour, Hitler also departed in a special train. Upon arriving in Munich, Halifax proceeded to the National Socialist Party headquarters, and shortly after, returned by car to Berlin. During the meeting, Dr. Schmidt, a German Foreign Ministry interpreter, was responsible for interpretation.

<p>[London] The newspapers here have published detailed reports of Lord Halifax's meeting with German leader Hitler. They paid particular attention to the statement from German officials that all issues related to Anglo-German relations were discussed during the talks. According to a report in the Daily Telegraph, Berlin is very satisfied with the Halifax-Hitler talks, considering them a basis for further discussions between the two countries, and suggesting that Britain may send officials to Germany for formal inquiries. (Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency in London, 20th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] It is reported that the informal talks between the British Privy Councillor and German cabinet members have reached a considerable stage. It is hoped that they will soon be transferred to formal channels. Furthermore, the German side is extremely satisfied with the trend of these negotiations.

<h3>Major Reshuffle of Italian Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>Significant political developments are expected. Prime Minister assumes concurrent role of Minister of Colonies. Osto succeeds as Governor-General of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>[Rome] The government issued an order today reshuffling a large number of cabinet members. This move indicates that there will be significant changes in Italian politics. Prime Minister Mussolini's concurrent role as Minister of Colonies suggests that Italy will intensify its activities in Africa and accelerate the development of its newly occupied territories there. While the position of Undersecretary of Colonies is assigned to Fascist Party Army Commander De Vecchi, the Governor-General of Abyssinia will be assumed by Duke Osto, as the Duke belongs to the House of Savoy. Italy's conquest of Abyssinia was carried out in the name of the royal family. It is now known that Duke Osto will likely travel to Abyssinia at the beginning of next month. Regarding economic policy, the newly appointed Minister of Exchange and Currency, Guarneri, formerly served as Minister of Finance and enjoys a high reputation. Currently, Italy's economic policy is geared towards self-sufficiency, with Guarneri effectively acting as its dictator. Secondly, the promotion of Licini, head of the Fascist Youth Organization, to Undersecretary of the Ministry of Corporations is also extremely important. The addition of an Undersecretary to this ministry is due to the fact that as Italy's politics and trade have already been controlled, the production of various industries will inevitably be subjected to control as well.</p>
<p>Garcelli is appointed as the civil administrator of Addis Ababa (i.e., the capital of Abyssinia), and General Garavello is appointed as the garrison commander of Addis Ababa. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to official news released today, Duke Osto has succeeded General Graziani as Governor-General of Abyssinia. General Graziani is known as the "Liaoyang General of Italy" and is a confidant of the Italian King. However, he recently resigned due to poor health. Mussolini sent him a letter expressing the nation's gratitude for his contributions to the conquest of Abyssinia. Duke Osto is the eldest son of the late Duke Osto, is currently 39 years old, and is one of the most popular members of the royal family. He strongly supports the Fascist system and has served in the cavalry and air force. His wife is Princess Francine. (Reuter dispatch from the Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Italian Solidarity</h3>
<p>New commercial treaty to be signed next month. Manchukuo to join Anti-Comintern Pact.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated today that "Manchukuo" will join the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy on November 25. On that day, the full text of the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by the five countries of Japan, Germany, Italy, "Manchukuo," and the Spanish National Army Government will be released in the capitals of the five countries. Yesterday, the "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Japan will formally recognize the Spanish National Army Government on November 25. (Reuter dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government, due to the establishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy Anti-Comintern Pact and wishing to exercise spiritual and political solidarity with Italy, will also establish trade relations with Italy's new colony of Abyssinia without treaty relations. Therefore, it has decided to conclude a new Japan-Italy trade treaty. Ambassador Hotta, stationed in Italy, has been conducting negotiations with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on instructions from his home government. Recently, the governments of Japan and Italy have completed the informal signing of the Japan-Italy Comprehensive Trade Treaty. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently rushing to process the treaty documents and will soon consult with the Privy Council to take the necessary procedures. At the latest, the formal signing can be completed in Rome in mid-next month. Regarding Abyssinia, which Germany has recognized as Italy's new colony and with which it has concluded a trade treaty, the Japanese government's conclusion of a new Japan-Italy trade treaty will make this fact even more evident. The friendly relations among Japan, Germany, and Italy, which have been embodied in the Anti-Comintern Pact, will be further strengthened in substance. As a result, the amount of Japanese exports to Italy is estimated to increase from 5-6 million yen to 10 million yen. The main categories of goods will be cotton products, sundries, and food. As for the amount of Italian exports to Japan, the aim is to balance Japanese and Italian exports and imports, with both sides generally agreeing to equal imports. The items imported from Abyssinia will be leather, livestock, and various grains, while an equal amount of industrial salt will be imported from Italian Somaliland. The Italian government intends to use the conclusion of the new trade treaty as an opportunity to formulate a new tariff system for Italy's East African colonies, including Abyssinia, Somaliland, Eritrea, and Cyrenaica.

<h3>Germany and Russia to Mutually Close Consulates</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Germany and the Soviet Union have previously decided to close several consulates mutually established in each other's countries. It is expected that only Moscow, Kiev, Novosibirsk, and Minsk will remain. German sources believe that trade between Germany and the Soviet Union is decreasing daily and is almost entirely concentrated in Moscow. Therefore, there is no need to establish consulates in other parts of the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet consulates in Germany will also be reduced as much as possible, with Soviet consulates being established only in two cities in northern Germany.

<h3>US Plans to Add Two Battleships</h3>
<p>Secretary of the Navy requests Congress for funds</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the annual report submitted by Secretary of the Navy Swanson, the United States is not building warships as quickly as Britain, but it is still the world's second-largest naval power, with a total of 325 warships, totaling 1,083,330 tons. Among them, only 113 vessels, totaling 869,398 tons, have not reached the end of their service life. Britain has a total of 285 warships, totaling 1,260,398 tons, of which 181 vessels, totaling 1,042,000 tons, have not reached the end of their service life. Japan has a total of 200 warships, totaling 745,694 tons, of which 171 vessels, totaling 708,158 tons, have not reached the end of their service life. In light of this situation, Secretary of the Navy Swanson plans to request Congress to allocate funds to build two battleships to replace old ships that have reached the end of their service life. He also wants to add first-class cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. The United States does not intend to accelerate its shipbuilding efforts, but this would be reconsidered in "unavoidable circumstances." (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

<h3>Enemy Ships Return to Yuhuan and Toumen to Bombard</h3>
<p>Artillery fire can be heard in the urban area.</p>
<p>Taizhou Correspondence. On the afternoon of the ninth, at 2:00 PM, four enemy ships suddenly arrived off the coast of Toumen Town, Yuhuan County, firing more than ten shells at the shore. The Yuhuan urban area and nearby areas could clearly hear the artillery fire. However, our defenses are tight. At about 5:00 PM, the enemy ships began to sail in other directions. Also, at 8:30 AM on the morning of the tenth, nine enemy bombers were spotted over Wenling, flying from the Yuhuan sea towards the northeast.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Repeatedly Attack Xia Bengbu, Still Reported Safe and Peaceful</h3>
<p>Shops Gradually Reopening for Business, Citizens Calm, Stable and Unchanged</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence. Since the enemy planes have bombed Bengbu three times, the citizens have become accustomed to it, remaining calm as usual. Most of the stores on the major bustling streets, such as Dama Road, Erma Road, and Jingyi Road, have reopened for business. It is reported that some of those that have not yet reopened have done so because their employees have returned to their hometowns, which is indeed difficult to overcome. The police department has been dispatching personnel to persuade them separately, so it is expected that they will gradually return to normal. However, in the evenings, because there are fewer electric lights and citizens do not go out much, the bustling scene is no longer like before. Movie theaters have difficulty showing films as usual, and there are few viewers. Theaters have all announced that they are closed. The singers in the music halls have mostly migrated elsewhere to find other places to settle down.</p>
<p>During the curfew imposed on the night after the third enemy air raid, military police arrested four traitors disguised as beggars: Wang Xiaosuo, Wang San, Wang Kunshan, and Xia Anmin. They were taken to the battalion headquarters for questioning. They all confessed that they had been instigated by others to act as traitors in Bengbu, spying on military intelligence without denial. Xia Anmin (from Yangzhou, addicted to opium) even confessed that he received a subsidy of 30 yuan per month from the enemy, and a Kangxi copper coin was found as evidence of his role in espionage. The three traitors surnamed Wang were sent to the capital for disposal, while Xia Anmin was sent by the military police to the Xuzhou-Haizhou Garrison Command in Tongshan for legal processing on the afternoon of the ninth.</p>

Unexpectedly, at about 5:00 AM on the morning of the ninth of this month, 12 enemy sailors from an enemy ship off the coast of Lianyungang approached the ship in a small motorboat. They drove the twelve crew members away. The enemy soldiers then poured more than 500 barrels of raw oil loaded on the ship onto the hull and set the ship on fire. The crew members have reported the truth to the local garrison.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Reactionary Organizations</p>
<p>Zhong Biqian, the district chief of the fifth district of Shuyang County, previously captured a member of the Big Heaven Society, Ji Hanling, in Tangjian in that district. Subsequently, according to his confession, he captured Zhang Zhucheng and other accomplices of the same name in Huanan Township in that district. They have been sent to the county government for interrogation. According to investigation, the Big Heaven Society is a disguised organization of the Sage and Virtue Dao, and its function is still to incite ignorant people and plot illegal activities.</p>

<h3>Adverse Weather on the Zhejiang Sea Delays Delivery of Tribute Rice to Shanghai</h3>
<p>First Batch Expected to Arrive in Port Today or Tomorrow, Sale Price Set at 8.5 Fen per Shanghai Sheng</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council and the China Southern Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase Saigon rice to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents, the first batch of 25,000 bags, loaded on the Jia Ying, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The Chinese government specially approved tax-free imports. Rice merchants began to complete payment and rice distribution procedures yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jia Ying Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Saigon rice purchased by the Municipal Council in cooperation with the China Southern Rice Industry Company totals 115,000 bags, each weighing 220 pounds, totaling 198 Shanghai Jin, equivalent to 1 Shi and 2.5 Dou. It has been loaded onto foreign ships and set sail for Shanghai, designated exclusively for maintaining the food supply for Shanghai residents. The first batch of 25,000 bags, loaded on the Jia Ying, a ship of the British Taikoo Steamship Company, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (21st), unloading at the Jinliyuan Wharf. However, due to the adverse weather on the Zhejiang sea yesterday, it may be delayed until tomorrow morning (22nd). The second, third, and fourth batches of 30,000 bags each will be completely delivered by the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Chinese Government Grants Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Yesterday, sources in the grain industry revealed that the purpose of the China Southern Rice Industry Company's cooperation with the Municipal Council to purchase foreign rice is to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents. The money earned will be used for refugee relief. Therefore, the Chinese government has specially approved tax-free imports. As for the distribution method of the first batch of 25,000 bags of foreign rice, 10,000 bags will be allocated to member rice shops of the Rice Merchants Association for retail sales, and 5,000 bags will be allocated to relief organizations for refugee relief. Today, the Rice Merchants Association stipulated that 300 businesses in the Public Concession and 200 businesses in the French Concession will handle retail sales, with each business receiving 40 bags. The price for retail sales is 8.5 fen per Shanghai Jin, and each person is limited to purchasing 1 yuan's worth.</p>
<p>Association Announces Rice Collection Procedures</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association issued a notice yesterday regarding the procedures for member rice shops to collect rice, as follows: (1) Payment date: Starting from Saturday, November 20, until Sunday, November 21; (2) Payment location: Bank of China, 276 Sichuan Road; (3) After the rice payment is completed, the bank will issue a delivery order. Please pay attention to whether the rice payment and delivery order are consistent, and consult with the Bank of China. Although today is a Sunday, which is normally closed, the Bank of China will be open as usual to facilitate payment for rice.</p>
<p>Price of Tribute Rice for Rice Shops</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association stipulates the price for member rice shops to collect tribute rice: For the first batch of 20,000 bags, (1) Delivered at the wharf: 16.15 yuan per bag of national currency; (2) Delivered at the warehouse: 16.45 yuan per bag of national currency, plus an additional 0.25 yuan per bag for external fees. Previously, the price for collecting rice stored by the Municipal Council was approximately 17.34 yuan per bag of national currency. This price is slightly lower, so the retail price has also been reduced from 9 fen to 8.5 fen per Shanghai Jin.</p>
<p>500 Rice Shops Undertake Retail Sales</p>
<p>The distribution method for the first batch of Saigon rice arriving in Shanghai has been decided as follows: 20,000 bags will be retailed by member rice shops of the Rice Merchants Association, and 5,000 bags will be used by relief organizations to maintain the food supply for refugees. Currently, 300 companies in the Public Concession, including Deng Rentai, and 200 companies in the French Concession, including Baohe, have started paying at the Bank of China yesterday based on the rice collection certificates issued by the association. Each company can collect 40 bags of rice, and each company will distribute 4 bags per day. The selling price is based on the agreement of the association, at 8.5 fen per Shanghai Jin, and each person is limited to purchasing 1 yuan's worth. It is reported that in the future, all 1,500 rice shops in the city will sell at the market price stipulated by the authorities of the two concessions, with each Shanghai Sheng set at 8.5 fen. There are also plans to lower the price of rice in the future, so that the food supply for the people will be abundant and worry-free.</p>
<p>Strictly Prevent Rice Shops from Hoarding and Speculating</p>
<p>After the rice supply in Shanghai once became insufficient, all parties paid close attention to the matter, as it concerned the food supply for the people. Everyone suspected that some rice shops had hoarded a large amount of rice to sell at a higher price. Therefore, the concession authorities attached great importance to this issue. The French Concession, in particular, dispatched several Chinese and Western detectives every day to search the rice shops within the concession. The police are now seriously preventing rice merchants from hoarding. If a shipment of 5 Dou of rice is discovered on the road, the source will be thoroughly investigated. If it is found that there is private selling, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>Investigating Population to Distribute Food</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities, in order to ensure the food supply for the Chinese constables of each police station, specially printed forms to investigate the population of the constables' families, preparing to distribute food. It is stipulated that only wives and children are entitled to this right. Parents, brothers, and sisters are not eligible.</p>
<p>French Authorities Also Purchase Foreign Rice</p>
<p>In addition to dispatching Chinese detectives to investigate the amount of rice stored in various rice shops within the concession and strictly prohibiting hoarding, the French Concession authorities, in order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents, have also ordered a large amount of foreign rice from French Indochina to be shipped to Shanghai. Also, before our army withdrew, rice ships carrying a total of about 20,000 Shi of rice arrived in Shanghai from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and were anchored in Nanshi. After our army withdrew, they could not unload the cargo. Now, the French authorities and Father Jacquinot, at the request of various rice industry groups, have negotiated with the Japanese side to release the ships.</p>
<h3>鎭海要塞封鎖期間德平定期開甬</h3>
<p>The Fortress Command Reluctantly Makes Exceptions, Scheduled to Set Sail for Ningbo on the 24th</p>
<p>Since the Zhenhai Fortress Command prohibited navigation for all Ningbo-bound liners from various foreign companies operating in this port starting on the 17th, the Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing was the first to suspend service and reroute to Wenzhou. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's (華義公司) De Ping had already sold tickets, and many passengers had boarded. The company repeatedly requested permission from the Zhenhai authorities to operate one more trip, but the request was denied, and the ship has been docked in Shanghai for four days. The company sent personnel to the ship to refund tickets to passengers, but the passengers were unwilling to disembark and unanimously expressed their willingness to wait on board until the ship could depart for Ningbo. Yesterday, the company telegraphed Ningbo again, requesting the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to consult with the Fortress Command to see if an exception could be made to allow the De Ping to transport the Ningbo refugees who had already boarded back to their hometowns, so as to avoid leaving the refugees stranded in Shanghai. By the afternoon, the company had received a reply telegram from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, stating that they had conveyed the request to the commander of the Zhenhai Fortress, and Commander Wang indicated that he was inclined to agree to make an exception once more, but the date could not be determined. They would await notification to the Chamber before telegraphing Shanghai again to order departure for Ningbo. Therefore, the De Ping had already completed the export customs clearance procedures for departure to Ningbo yesterday and informed all passengers on board to wait for the departure date. If it could sail on Monday (i.e., tomorrow), that would be best, but if not, it would definitely depart for Ningbo on Wednesday. According to another source, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been ordered to suspend service due to our military authorities' blockade of the Zhenhai sea entrance, prohibiting ships from entering and exiting. Taikoo's Xin Beijing has already rerouted to Wenzhou, and the China Merchants' En De is also determined to reroute to Tongzhou. However, because tickets for the De Ping have already been sold and many passengers have boarded and are waiting to depart, unwilling to refund their tickets, the company telegraphed the Ningbo Fortress Command again to request an exception. It is now learned that permission has been granted for the ship to sail to Ningbo on the 24th, and all purchased tickets will be valid. However, it will first sail to Tongzhou this morning, so ticket sales have already begun yesterday. Grand cabin is 15 yuan, official cabin is 8 yuan, room cabin is 5 yuan, grand economy is 3 yuan and 5 jiao, small economy is 1 yuan and 3 jiao, and deck berth is 4 yuan. As for the Shanghai-Ningbo tickets sold previously, passengers can reclaim the original price from the company. The China Merchants Company posted a notice at the entrance yesterday, stating that the De Ping has received a telegram from Ningbo, granting permission to sail to Ningbo next Wednesday (i.e., the 24th). Passengers are requested to board the ship next Wednesday. Purchased tickets will remain valid. Those who do not wish to go may return their tickets for a refund. Special notice. The reason for not transferring via Zhoushan for Shanghai-Ningbo traffic is that, if not passing through Zhenhai, the ship could sail directly to Chuanshan and reach Ningbo via the Ningchuan Highway. However, ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, such as Taikoo's Xin Beijing, China Merchants' En De, and De Ping, have too deep a draft and can only sail to Dinghai, not directly to Chuanshan. Therefore, a small ferry would be required to continue the journey from Dinghai to Chuanshan, causing much inconvenience to passengers. This is also the reason why China Merchants has temporarily abandoned operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>
<h3>世界航輪陸續來滬</h3>
<p>World Liners Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>With the Shift of War to the West, the Tense Situation in Shanghai Gradually Eases; British Taikoo Blue Funnel Line's first world liner, Glengarry, entered and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying passengers and cargo. It is also reported that a second world liner, Sapredon, will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th, and a third liner, Dencalion, will enter port on the 26th. The cargo manifests have arrived in Shanghai in advance, with extremely small quantities, both liners carrying less than one hundred tons, a huge difference compared to the usual two to three thousand tons per trip. It can be seen that Sino-foreign trade has been greatly affected by the war, causing a sharp decline.</p>
<h3>連日大潮浦水上陸</h3>
<p>Successive Days of High Tide, River Water Floods Ashore</p>
<p>Low-Lying Areas Become Waterlogged</p>
<p>For the past few days, the port has experienced high tides. Low-lying areas in the Chinese and foreign concessions have become waterlogged. Yesterday was especially severe. From around 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., along the Bund area of the Huangpu River in the foreign concession, water flooded ashore. The area south of the Customs pier, being lower in elevation, was particularly affected, with water depths reaching one foot. Due to the strong northeast wind, the Huangpu River and the floodwaters merged, creating huge waves and almost turning the area into a vast expanse of water. Other areas, such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, Four-Ma Road (i.e., Fuzhou Road), the Daxin Street intersection, the entrances of the Sincere and Wing On department stores on Nanjing Road, and the section leading to the Small Garden, experienced knee-deep water. Sewage drains overflowed with tidal water, as if subterranean dragons were irrepressibly rising. In the French Concession, the vegetable market street, east and west Zilaihuo Street, and other areas also experienced severe flooding, no less than in the Public Concession. In Zhabei, north of the Suzhou Creek, from Tianhougong Bridge westward, along the river through Pentang Lane Bridge, Laozha Bridge, Old Garbage Bridge, to New Garbage Bridge, the lowest points had water depths of no less than three feet. As a result, shops, businesses, and residents in the area were living in water. North Zhejiang Road, Haining Road, and other low-lying areas also had standing water, knee-deep in some places and ankle-deep in others. South of the First Special District Court, a large open area was flooded, creating a channel. The wasteland behind the Bank of Communications warehouse and along the river on Guangfu Road, west of New Garbage Bridge, were also merged with the Suzhou Creek. The New Zha Bridge ferry crossing, through the Sampan Factory, New Bridge, to Tanzikou, was also flooded. This high tide was truly unprecedented in recent years.</p>
<h3>美敎士規戒藍金</h3>
<p>American Missionary Reprimands Rankin</p>
<p>Do Not Make Critical and Absurd Remarks, Assist China in Times of Urgent Difficulty</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many foreigners have righteously expressed fair opinions in Western newspapers. However, there are also those who are narrow-minded and take advantage of the situation to criticize the Chinese authorities. For example, an American missionary named Rankin recently sent a letter to the North-China Daily News, taking issue with the Chinese government's rejection of registration for church schools, and making bizarre remarks criticizing China, involving the Sino-Japanese War. Yesterday, the newspaper published a letter from another American missionary, reprimanding Rankin, showing that justice is in people's hearts and that the biased views of one or two individuals will not escape public criticism. The letter stated: "The letter from Mr. Rankin published in your newspaper on November 16, regarding the Chinese government's attitude towards Christian schools, has attracted my attention. I am also a missionary, and I do not wish to endorse everything stated by this gentleman. If my information is correct, he must be an isolated missionary who is merely self-promoting. I belong to a church with hundreds of missionaries and am an officer of an organization related to more than 500 missionaries. The vast majority of these missionaries do not agree with Rankin's remarks and are as sincere as I am. I cannot help but feel that it is absurd to raise such issues at this time by those who consider themselves friends of China. I sincerely hope that our friends of China will believe that the vast majority of missionaries do not hold the same attitude as Mr. Rankin and will do their utmost to assist China in its time of urgent difficulty."</p>
<h3>內地交通梗阻滬通航運擁擠</h3>
<p>Inland Transportation Disrupted, Shanghai-Tongzhou Shipping Overcrowded</p>
<p>Jiangsu Routes the Only Throughway, Foreign Vessels Operate Extra Sailings</p>
<p>After the transformation of the Shanghai battle situation, land and inland waterways transportation between Shanghai and the interior regions was disrupted. Inland residents remaining in Shanghai who wished to leave and return to their hometowns found it particularly inconvenient. All routes of transportation depended on foreign shipping companies to maintain operations. Consequently, foreign ships sailing from Shanghai have been fully loaded with passengers in recent days. The Shanghai-Tongzhou route is especially congested, as residents along the Shanghai-Nanjing line are returning to their hometowns by taking ships from Shanghai to Nantongzhou, then crossing to Zhenjiang or Nanjing, and then traveling to their respective destinations. Therefore, all passenger and cargo transportation on Taikoo's Xin Beijing, China Merchants' En De, and other ships is abnormally congested.</p>
<p>Another report states that, since the tense situation in Shanghai disrupted land transportation, the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Tongzhou routes have become the only important transportation routes. Now that the Shanghai-Ningbo route has also been ordered to temporarily suspend service, the passenger and cargo volume on the Shanghai-Tongzhou route has suddenly increased. In addition to the British Taikoo's Wuhu and Wuxue, and Jardine Matheson's Pinghe and Tonghe, the Italian China Merchants' De Ping has also joined the operation of this route.</p>
<h3>海關行政保持現狀</h3>
<p>Customs Administration Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>According to Reliable Reuters News, the Japanese Side Will Not Take Further Action</p>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 20th: Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the Japanese side will not take further action to disrupt China's customs administration. It is noted that the Chinese Customs anti-smuggling fleet in Shanghai, as well as a dredger from the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, have recently been intercepted by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. However, given the international nature of Chinese Customs and the wide scope of customs duties as collateral for the Boxer Indemnity and foreign debt, the Japanese authorities' actions are of great concern in several respects. However, there is also a belief that the Japanese actions are purely temporary or will not take further actions to disrupt this important institution, nor will they divert the revenue guaranteeing the repayment of foreign debt for other purposes. The Shanghai Whangpoo Conservancy Board is also an institution governed by the international agreements of 1905 and 1912. The Board's function is to maintain the channel of the Huangpu River, which is of great importance to the convenience of ships of all countries, and Japan is also a signatory to the aforementioned international agreements.</p>
<h3>恢復遠東航綫大來正加考慮</h3>
<p>Dollar Line Actively Considering Restoring Far East Routes</p>
<p>American Importers and Exporters Unanimously Request, Transportation Can Be Restored in the Short Term</p>
<p>After the Shanghai battle, the Dollar Line Steamship Company's Far East routes were temporarily suspended to avoid danger, causing American goods to be unable to be transported to China and Chinese products unable to be exported, greatly affecting American importers and exporters. According to statistics, the losses suffered by American businesses in these three months are difficult to quantify in detail. Now that the Shanghai battle has shifted inward, the danger in Shanghai has decreased, and insurance premiums have also been greatly reduced. Therefore, American businesses have requested the company to restore the Shanghai route to resume transportation. It is reported that the company is already considering it and it is expected to be implemented soon. It is reported that our country's famous products, such as tung oil, are most popular among American manufacturers, and the American side has repeatedly telegraphed Shanghai requesting shipment.</p>

<p>One Thousand Male Workers, Have Entered the Factory for Preparation</p>
<p>The Yangshupu factory in Pudong, owned by the British Gu Zhong Tobacco Co., Ltd. (i.e., the British American Tobacco Company), was forced to close after the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. The company, in order to help unemployed workers, distributed temporary relief payments in installments. Now, in view of the gradual restoration of order in Shanghai, it has decided to plan the reopening of the Pudong factory. Approximately one thousand male workers from the machine, coppersmith, and printing departments have been assigned to enter the factory at 6 a.m. every morning via a special ship from Puxi to the factory pier in Pudong to prepare everything. They return to Puxi on the same ship at 5 p.m. The workers wear the company's prescribed yellow uniform. The factory will officially reopen after the preparations are completed. The factory employs approximately four thousand male and female workers, and its products include cigarettes of the brands "Great Britain", "Old Knife", "Sky Bridge", "Fairy", and "Front Gate".</p>
<p>時評</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>英美互惠商約談判</h3>
<p>Anglo-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement Negotiations — Appropriate</p>
<p>The initial contact between the United Kingdom and the United States to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement has been quite successful. According to statements made recently by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and US Secretary of State Hull, formal negotiations will begin soon. Furthermore, the governments of Canada and Australia have respectively indicated that the British dominions will also negotiate trade agreements with the United States. The United Kingdom and the United States, as two major democracies, have always held a leading position in the world economy. At a time when the world is threatened by war, consolidating the economic ties between the two major countries can also lay the foundation for political cooperation. As the New York Times rightly said, this event will undoubtedly have a stabilizing influence on the situation everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine the possible impact on the Far East. The United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have traditionally formed a three-way balance of power in the Far East market. The fundamental motive behind Japan's recent acts of aggression is to seize the markets of the United Kingdom and the United States, in addition to destroying China's emerging national industries. However, Japan's economic structure is inherently unsound and has been burdened by the heavy weight of aggressive warfare, which will only lead to economic collapse. Japan's attempt to achieve economic goals through military means is ultimately a delusion. Currently, the United Kingdom and the United States seem unable to effectively stop Japan's aggressive warfare. In fact, the arms race between the United Kingdom and the United States against Japan is gradually intensifying. The current move by the United Kingdom and the United States to unite their economic forces through the conclusion of a reciprocal trade agreement has profound implications for the political situation in the Far East. This is because economics, politics, and military affairs are a trinity, interconnected. Japanese newspapers commented on the Anglo-American trade agreement as an action by the democratic bloc to counter the countries that have concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact. This shows that militaristic Japan is indeed feeling considerable pressure.</p>

<p>The Organization of the Nanshi Refugee Zone Becomes More Concrete</p>
<p>Food Shortage is Again Felt, Medical Needs are Urgent, Father Jacquinot's Views on the Refugee Zone</p>
<p>Since Father Jacquinot of the International Relief Committee has been making great efforts to maintain the Nanshi Refugee Zone, the situation has become increasingly well-organized. The coal and salt transportation problem has also been negotiated, and they can be directly delivered into the zone. Currently, in order to intensify the work and make it more concrete, the various staff members of the refugee zone have been assigned, as follows:</p>
<p>Estimated Staff</p>
<p>① Office in the Zone: Director Pan Zhijie, Clerks Jiang Zhiqing, Xu Hongkang, Lu Deshen, Cao Xiangshen; ② Food Distribution: Pan Shousheng, Yang Yanjun, Lu Zhiqian, Wei Qingyan, Lu Bingxiang, Jiang Chuibing; ③ Management of Refugee Children: Chen Tiesheng, Zhao Jian, Xu Zuotong, of the Catholic Orphanage; ④ Transportation: Lu Longqi; ⑤ Supervision and Cleaning: Feng Yangshan, Zhang Xianqing, Qi Bingzhang, Mu Jialiang; ⑥ Hospital and Medical Care: The Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Red Cross Society will be responsible.</p>
<p>Donations Received</p>
<p>In addition, the association received donations in the past two days as follows: The Wang brothers, Wang Yilin, Wang Yiji, Wang Yipeng, Wang Yijun, donated three yuan each; Wang Zhaozhang, one yuan; Employees of the China Soap Company, forty-one yuan; Xia Dajin, three yuan; Pan Liping, Miao Ruifang, Pan Jinlin, three yuan each; Luo Ruihong, one yuan. In addition, the Rotary Club is voluntarily responsible for providing food for 1,000 refugees daily at the No. 4 shelter on Xiaoshadu Road, with a temporary limit of two months, and will continue to take responsibility afterward, having already recognized 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Food Depleted</p>
<p>According to news from the International Relief Committee, although the food for the Nanshi Refugee Zone has been maintained for the past few days thanks to the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life, the remaining food has been depleted due to the large population. Recent donations have been very few, causing difficulties in providing food for the refugees. In addition to actively finding ways to purchase large quantities of food for assistance, the association also hopes that enthusiastic people will continue to donate to save the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Pitiable Deaths from Illness</p>
<p>Many refugees in the refugee zone are suffering from illness due to the recent bad weather. Furthermore, the lack of doctors in the zone often leads to deaths. The Red Swastika Society has set up a mortuary in the zone to collect the remains of deceased refugees. It is estimated that approximately nine refugees die each day. The Red Swastika Society is responsible for providing coffins and burial.</p>
<p>Medical Issues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a hospital has been established in the Nanshi security zone yesterday. A wealthy Chinese man has generously lent a large residence for this purpose. The sick and wounded in the zone are being cared for by French Daughters of Charity and Chinese nurses. Chinese and foreign doctors are also providing daily consultations. There are currently not many beds in the hospital, but they will be increased at any time. It is hoped that two more hospitals will be established in the zone in the next few days. The difficulty lies in the supply of medicines, but it is expected that philanthropists will come forward. Vaccination of the refugees will begin soon to prevent the outbreak of epidemics. Currently, seven or eight corpses are being abandoned on the streets every day. There are also daily deaths in the refugee shelters. The Chinese Medical Association is also providing medical care to the refugees, providing much assistance. It is expected that the medical work will be ready in a few days.</p>
<p>Categorized Budget</p>
<p>The budget for the zone is now divided into four categories: ① Hospitals and medical supplies, ② Cotton clothing, ③ Food, ④ Miscellaneous. The last category includes efforts to expand the refugee zone to the south of Nanshi. All garbage is being incinerated to ensure the cleanliness of the streets. The committee has inspected vacant houses along Minquan Road to accommodate additional refugees. Yesterday, another 4,000 refugees arrived in the zone from Pudong. A total of 150,000 pancakes and steamed buns were distributed to the refugees yesterday. When the refugee zone was first established, it was limited to 30,000, but since its establishment, the number of people has increased daily. It is currently still able to cope, but the nutritional content of the food is still insufficient. Six ships are currently loaded with rice from Vietnam to Shanghai, which will arrive within days, so a hot meal can be provided to the refugees. The committee is in great need of soybeans to prevent beriberi among the refugees. According to Father Jacquinot's remarks to a reporter yesterday, the Nanshi refugee zone can serve as a model for Europe in the event of future wars. A place can be designated to settle the poor non-combatants. Specially trained groups from neutral countries should then rescue the civilians of the warring countries.</p>
<h3>亞洲旅館昨晚盜刧</h3>
<p>Robbery at the Asia Hotel Last Night</p>
<p>One Robber Killed on the Spot, Two Injured by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>Wu Zhenghua, the owner of the Tailong rice shop in Yangjiadu, Pudong, has some assets. Recently, due to the fall of Pudong, Wu and his family rented room 237 in the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, attracting the attention of thieves. At 6:30 p.m. yesterday, several thugs suddenly broke into Wu's room, threatening and intimidating, ransacking boxes and cabinets. They robbed him of 285 yuan in national currency and five savings passbooks before escaping with their loot. Wu, together with the hotel staff, followed and pursued them. As the robbers stepped out of the main gate, they fled towards Henan Road. The owner reported the incident to the police station of the Public Concession, who then chased after them, blowing their whistles frantically. One robber fled into Jinlong Street, turned south onto Shandong Road, and then to Guangdong Road, where nearby police officers gathered after hearing the alarm. They opened fire on the robber, hitting him in a vital spot, killing him instantly. During the hail of bullets, two people were injured by stray bullets. One, Ah Rong, the doorman of Fuxing Garden on Wuma Road, was shot in the waist and was seriously injured. The other, Yang Jiequan (from Wuxi, 20 years old), was injured in the left ear, with the bullet passing through. It is reported that Yang is a refugee from the Yiyuan Shelter. The robber who was killed was transported to the morgue by Chinese police officer No. 2728 from the Old Zha police station for examination. The injured were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>牛惠霖醫師逝世</h3>
<p>Dr. Niu Huilin Passes Away</p>
<p>Liver Disease Aggravated by Worries about National Crisis, Untreatable, Encoffining at 2:00 PM Tomorrow, Funeral at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Dr. Niu Huilin, a famous doctor, had contracted liver disease due to overwork. He had been unable to practice medicine for several months. The death of his younger brother, Dr. Niu Huisheng, caused him further grief and worsened his illness. With the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, Niu was treated at the Jiaxing Gospel Hospital. He was then escorted to Shanghai by five famous American doctors. After ascites was drained from his abdomen, his condition improved slightly. However, concerned about the severely wounded soldiers and major surgeries, he still directed relief efforts from his sickbed from time to time. He was particularly concerned about Madam Chiang's car accident and injuries on her way to Shanghai. Overwork then caused his illness to turn for the worse. As our troops retreated to the second line of defense, his family did not dare to inform him. Unexpectedly, he learned of the intense military situation in Suzhou and Jiaxing last night, and his illness suddenly worsened due to worry and grief. He passed away suddenly at 7:00 a.m. this morning at his home on Jing'an Temple Road. His wife and sons were by his side, in great sorrow. On the orders of Madam Ni, a funeral service will be held at his home at 2:00 p.m. on the 22nd, followed by a funeral procession at 3:00 p.m., temporarily placed in the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, awaiting selection of a date for burial in the Universal Cemetery. Yesterday, Generalissimo Chiang and his wife, and Director Kong and his wife, sent condolences to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Niu</p>
<p>Dr. Niu Huilin was 49 years old and from Shanghai. After graduating from St. John's University at a young age, he studied at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School in London, England, where he obtained a medical doctorate. From 1913 to 1914, he served as the Director of Outpatient Clinics for Internal Medicine, External Medicine, and Otorhinolaryngology at the London Hospital in England. From 1914 to 1916, during the height of World War I, he served as the Director of Severely Wounded Soldiers at the Ipswich Hospital in England. From 1916 to 1918, he transferred to the Metropolitan Hospital in London as the Director of Surgery for Severely Wounded Soldiers. In 1918, his father passed away, and he resigned and returned to China. In that same year, he served as the Vice President and Director of Surgery at Renji Hospital in Shanghai until he resigned in 1934, when he became a surgical consultant at the hospital. From 1922 to 1927, the Chinese Red Cross Society Headquarters appointed him as the President of the Seager Road Red Cross General Hospital and as the President of the Red Cross Epidemic Hospital. During the Lincheng train robbery, the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan, and the disastrous impact on overseas Chinese, and the Qi-Lu War, Dr. Niu personally led the relief team as the commander-in-chief, along with doctors Jiao Xisheng and Fang Juying, to provide treatment. From 1922 to 1926, he also served concurrently as the President of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road. Starting in 1920, at the request of patients, he established Lin Sheng Hospital on Qiqi Road, and set up clinics at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Avenue Foch, until the present. During the January 28th Incident, he served as the President of the First Hospital for the Wounded Soldiers of the Shanghai Local Council, the Surgical Consultant for the Severely Wounded at the Red Cross 42nd Wounded Soldiers Hospital, and the Medical Officer of the Chinese Squad of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, holding this position since 1922. For more than ten years, he also served as a professor of surgery at St. John's University in Shanghai. The Central Government also appointed him as a medical consultant to the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Railways, the Department of Health, and the Central Hospital. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters also appointed him as a medical consultant. He served as the President of the Chinese Medical Association for two consecutive terms. During his lifetime, he established numerous hospitals and medical schools. His abdominal surgeries were especially well-renowned. The former Governor of Hong Kong's wife, suffering from an abdominal tumor, telegraphed for a famous surgeon from London to perform the operation, but then telegraphed again, stating that his surgical skills were not as good as Dr. Niu's, so she chartered an airplane to bring Dr. Niu to Hong Kong. She recovered quickly after the surgery. His fame is known worldwide.</p>
