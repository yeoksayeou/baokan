<p>英文大美晚報云、兩日前在界外築路區愚園路、為日兵拘去之華人嚴某等、現仍未開釋、聞拘禁公大第三廠由日兵看守、工部局當局因其地不屬工部局管轄、對於此事、不欲過問、界外築路則仍由公共租界巡捕巡邏、如日軍希圖接管諸路警務、或派武裝巡邏隊至該處、則工部局似將提出一種抗議、惟該問題殊形複雜、將來恐難免引起糾粉也、</p>

<h3>Intense Battle for Guanghua Gate; We Defend Yuhuatai Fort</h3>
<p>The situation in the capital remained unchanged last night. Japanese planes heavily bombed the entire city, causing widespread fires. Tang Shengzhi personally supervised the troops, boosting morale.</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to foreign sources, as of 10 PM tonight, the situation in Nanjing remains unchanged, and the capital is still held by Chinese troops. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Today, a telegram arrived here from Nanjing Garrison Commander Tang Shengzhi, with a rather tragic tone. It stated, "Our army is fighting against steel with flesh and blood; the number of casualties is naturally significant." Tang also stated that Nanjing is currently under heavy bombardment, and fierce fighting is ongoing near Yuhuatai and Zijin Mountain. Chinese troops are currently defending the Yuhuatai hilltop fort, fiercely resisting. Tang admitted that Guanghua Gate was breached by Japanese forces last night, but claimed that the situation in the capital is still under Chinese control, and they are resolutely fighting. However, it is difficult to predict how long Chinese troops can withstand the Japanese attacks. Nonetheless, the morale of the Chinese troops is extremely high. Tang also said that even if Japanese forces occupy Nanjing, the Chinese people will feel that their position to resist aggression is even more advantageous, because the further the Japanese advance, the more difficulties they will encounter. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The news of the fall of Wuhu has been confirmed by responsible foreign sources. Japanese troops completely occupied the port at 4:30 PM yesterday. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles at All Five Gates of the Capital</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese forces are relying on airplanes, artillery, and tanks to fiercely attack the Chinese defenders, determined to occupy Nanjing. Therefore, there is fierce fighting at all five gates of the capital. Among them, the battle outside Zhonghua Gate (i.e., South Gate) is the fiercest. It is reported that the Chinese troops are firmly defending the Yuhuatai hilltop fort, fiercely resisting. There are three forts on top of Yuhuatai, securing the entrance to the South Gate. Zhonghua Road, the main commercial district of Nanjing, is located inside this gate. Meanwhile, according to Chinese sources, Zijin Mountain, where Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum is located, has been occupied by Japanese forces, and they are now preparing to attack Zhongshan and Taiping Gates. Zhongshan Gate is located on Nanjing's famous Zhongshan Road. Going out of this gate leads to the memorial park and the mausoleum. Taiping Gate is located slightly north of Zhongshan Gate. During the Taiping Rebellion years ago, the Qing army besieged Nanjing for ten years. Finally, Zeng Guofan led his army to breach the walls of Taiping Gate, and only then did they manage to occupy the city. The Chinese people are surprised that Japanese forces have occupied Zijin Mountain so early in the battle, because the defense works there are extremely strong. Now that this mountain has been occupied by Japanese forces, they have complete control of the entire city from its high vantage point. The Japanese can set up artillery on the summit and bombard any part of the city. Japanese forces occupying the airfield outside Guanghua Gate are now attacking Guanghua and Tongji Gates, which are east of Zhonghua Gate. (Japanese sources claim that they have already occupied Guanghua Gate). (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Our Army Reinforces and Defends Firmly</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese forces did not receive a reply to their ultimatum by 12:30 PM today. Half an hour after the deadline, they launched a general offensive on Nanjing in three directions, but have not achieved any significant victories as of tonight. Japanese forces used artillery on the mountains and bombing planes in the air to cover their advance. Chinese troops fought back valiantly and sent fighter planes to intercept, eventually driving away all the Japanese planes. Military obstacles and the airfield were not damaged in the slightest. The main force of the Japanese army, covered by a large number of tanks, attacked Guanghua Gate. Although they occupied the airfield outside Guanghua Gate, they suffered extremely heavy casualties. The Chinese soldiers defending the airfield resisted heroically, with no survivors. The Japanese forces then invaded the city gate. Before they had taken a few steps, they were driven out of the city by Chinese troops with courageous hand-to-hand combat. More reinforcements were added to defend firmly. According to Chinese claims, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and Chinese troops captured six tanks. During the fierce battle, Nanjing Garrison Commander General Tang Shengzhi personally supervised the battle in a tank on the front lines. (National Sea News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Our Army Counterattacks, Battle is Fierce</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency reports that after the Ito unit of the Wakisaka Detachment occupied Guanghua Gate, the Chinese army launched a large-scale counterattack from the front, and the Japanese army was temporarily caught in an extremely difficult battle.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reports that the Wakisaka Detachment of the Japanese army attacked Guanghua Gate at 5:30 PM on the 10th and engaged in fierce battle with the defending army. They occupied Guanghua Gate in the evening. At night, the Chinese army reinforced with a large force and repeatedly launched night attacks. The battle situation was fierce. Domei News Agency reports that after the Japanese army ordered a general attack on Nanjing at 11:00 AM this morning, the Katagiri, Ohno Noda, and Sukegawa units advanced from the northeast direction of Zijin Mountain towards Heping Gate and Taiping Gate. The Fuji and Isasa units advanced directly from the foot of Zijin Mountain towards Zhongshan Gate. Fierce battles broke out in all locations, and the battle situation was very intense.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency reports that the Japanese artillery established artillery positions on the first and second peaks of Zijin Mountain. After receiving the order for a general attack at 11:00 AM this morning, they fired at the city from time to time. The naval air force also cooperated with the army aircraft to be active.</p>
<h3>Advancing Japanese Troops Have Not Yet Succeeded</h3>
<p>[Hankou] According to news received here at noon today, the Japanese troops attacking Nanjing in three directions have been repulsed due to the heroic resistance of the Chinese troops. It is said that the Japanese troops have not yet been able to invade the city and occupy an inch of land. From dawn this morning, Nanjing was the target of intense heavy artillery bombardment by the Japanese army. The Japanese air force was also unusually active, bombing fiercely, as dense as rain, making the citizens of Nanjing fully aware of the horror of large-scale modern warfare. It is universally known that the Chinese army's equipment is far inferior to that of the Japanese army, but they are all sharpening their swords and bathing in blood, vowing to resist to the death and defend every inch of land, and their heroic bravery is unparalleled. (National Sea News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Envoy Suggests a Three-Day Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Today, the diplomatic mission, through the American Embassy in China, proposed another humanitarian suggestion to both China and Japan: "Please cease fire for three days. During the ceasefire, the Japanese army should not attack the city walls, so that the Chinese army can withdraw its troops." (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] A spokesman for the Chinese government declared to a reporter from the Sea News Agency today that the Chinese army is determined not to give up Nanjing. All kinds of rumors are groundless. He continued that the Chinese army has sent troops to reinforce the capital. The troops currently in the city are only a few divisions. The majority of the Chinese army is moving towards Nanchang to prevent the Japanese army from encircling them. Therefore, even if Nanjing unfortunately falls, the main force of the Chinese army can continue to resist. (National Sea News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Here, the battles in Nanjing are of great concern, but due to transportation difficulties, news is delayed, leading to numerous rumors, and reliable information is extremely difficult to obtain. Telephone and telegram communication between Nanjing and Hankou is only occasionally available. (National Sea News Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Our Planes Fly to Nanjing to Bomb Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Yesterday afternoon, Chinese planes were ordered to fly to Nanjing to bomb the attacking Japanese troops. They reported that large fires had broken out inside and outside the city, burning very fiercely. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Reuters Reporter Remains in Nanjing City</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The only Englishman remaining in Nanjing is Reuters reporter Mr. Smith. When the British community left the city on December 9, Mr. Smith was on a British gunboat outside Xiaguan. Yesterday, he returned to the city to inquire about the situation in the city as quickly as possible. Despite numerous dissuasions, he persisted. It is now believed that it is difficult for Mr. Smith to leave the city, as all the city gates leading to Xiaguan are closed, and the other gates are surrounded by Japanese troops. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

These three men lost everything they owned, and the clothes they are wearing now are borrowed, so the clothes do not fit, and their unshaven beards and hair make them look particularly miserable. It is said that the Japanese planes dropped a total of twelve bombs, of which no less than five landed on the Dehe ship or a few yards away from the ship. When the Dehe ship was approaching the Jardine Matheson Ship, the Japanese planes suddenly dropped three bombs, one of which directly hit the first-class cabin, and the other landed a few feet outside the starboard side. Both of these bombs had very strong explosive power, so their damage was quite large. The entire starboard side of the Dehe was destroyed, and the deck rooms were also blown away. The bridge was also destroyed, and none of the glass was intact. Although the crew desperately tried to use hoses to put out the fire, the hoses had been blown through and were useless. More than ten minutes later, four more bombs fell, one hitting the Dehe's smokestack, one landing between the Dehe and the Jardine Matheson Ship, and one landing on the starboard side, blasting a hole in the engine room and killing two stokers. At the same time, a fire broke out in the first-class cabin, and the lifeboats were immediately lowered to take passengers ashore. However, most of the passengers had already jumped into the river in panic to escape. At this time, the fire had spread throughout the ship. Although efforts to rescue continued, they were ultimately ineffective. The last crew members to leave the ship were the captain, the first mate, and the second engineer. They climbed down the river along the iron rope and were rescued by a Taikoo tugboat and sent to a British warship. In the afternoon, the Jardine Matheson Ship was also burned and perished together with the Dehe Ship. Fortunately, the number of casualties was not too high, with only four Chinese people dead and several injured. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Konoe and the Military Headquarters Tell the Japanese People That They Must Unite Even More in the Future</h3>
<p>Prepare for a Long War</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is expected that when the Japanese army completely occupies Nanjing, Prime Minister Konoe will issue a declaration, urging the people to unite as one and prepare for a long war. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese military headquarters recently issued an opinion, calling on the people to pay attention, saying that if Nanjing falls, it will be an important stage in the war, but the Sino-Japanese Incident will definitely not approach its end because of this. We should work harder in the future to achieve the goals of the war. (Domei Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The semi-official Japan Times stated today that, due to the fall of Nanjing, the opinions of Japanese financiers, leaders, and industrial and commercial giants on Japan's economic plan in the Asian continent have completely changed. Japan's original goal was limited to North China, but now it is necessary to draft a plan that includes all of North China, Central China, and South China. Leaders of the Japanese business community are now speaking out and thinking about plans for the reform of China's currency system, transportation, communications, aviation, and shipping, as these are all fundamental factors in China's economic structure. At the same time, the chairman of Mitsui &amp; Co. stated that the most urgent issue at present is what will happen to China's legal currency. The Tokyo financial community expressed cooperation with a new China that is disengaged from anti-Japanese and communist alliances. The chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kadono, said that Japan must now pay serious attention to China's future attitude and the attitude of the great powers. The chairman of the Japan Economic Federation said that the biggest and most important issue in the future is the economic development of North China. (Reuters, 11th) [Tokyo] Tokyo newspapers unanimously advocated that after the fall of Nanjing, the war must continue. The Kokumin Shimbun said that the fall of Nanjing means the collapse of the Nanjing government, but Japan's responsibility for a long-term war will be even greater. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that since the Kuomintang takes rejecting Japan as its main principle, if the party still holds power, even if Wang Jingwei replaces Chiang Kai-shek, Japan cannot be satisfied with a perfunctory reconciliation or an incomplete plan. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun congratulated the Japanese army on reaching Nanjing, which had disturbed peace in the Far East and was a base for anti-Japanese activities for the past ten years. However, the newspapers reiterated that after the victory in Nanjing, we should continue to move forward. The Hochi Shimbun explained the reason why China tends to wage a protracted war, saying that this is partly due to China's hope that Britain will come to its aid, and partly due to the increasing pressure from the Communist Party. The Asahi Shimbun said that the achievements of the Japanese army are indeed worth celebrating, but now we must warn the people not to be intoxicated by victory. It also said that the overall situation is now at an important turning point. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Japanese Troops Transferred Back from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Starting from around 9:00 AM yesterday, a large batch of Japanese troops wearing yellow uniforms were transferred back on the Suzhou River. They were all transported on large and small civilian boats, with each large boat carrying 50 to 60 people, medium boats carrying 30 to 40 people, and small boats carrying 10 to 20 people. The boats were all covered with sheds made of planks, bark, straw mats, etc., to keep out the cold. They brought food and drink such as pots, stoves, pigs, and sheep. According to eyewitnesses, there were about 250 ships passing by, all going from west to east towards the Huangpu River. It is said that they were transferred back from Wuxi, with a total of about 5,000 people.</p>
<h3>President Hoover Runs Aground off Taiwan</h3>
<p>Over Six Hundred Passengers Abandon Ship and Land on Island</p>
<p>[Manila] It was learned here today that the President Hoover, a large passenger ship, ran aground on a beach at the southern tip of Taiwan. Many passengers have been moved to a deserted island to await rescue. The ship's doctor has organized a temporary hospital on the island. Wireless communication with the ship has been lost, so the situation is unknown. It is only known that the Queen of Asia and other ships have gone to the rescue. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The President Hoover, a Dollar Steamship Lines ship carrying 650 passengers, ran aground on a small island in Taiwan this morning. It is now being battered by huge waves. After the ship encountered danger, the Henry Miller ship Prussian was anchored beside it, but it was still impossible to transfer the passengers to the Prussian. There are 300 third-class passengers on board. The Queen of Asia, after receiving the news here, sailed to assist and has arrived at its destination. A Taikoo tugboat left here at the same time as the Queen of Asia and is expected to arrive tonight. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>[Manila] Dollar Steamship Lines here has just received a telegram from the captain of the President Hoover stating that all 650 passengers have safely disembarked and landed on the island. Two US destroyers departed from the Philippines this morning for the island to provide protection. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Artillery Battles on Both Banks of the Yellow River in Shandong</h3>
<p>The Situation in Jinan City is Peaceful; Our Guerrillas are Extremely Active</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence since November 17, after the Japanese army crossed the Tuhai River and went straight to the north bank of the Yellow River, Jinan fell under the control and threat of artillery fire. In order to defend the natural barrier of the Yellow River, our side withdrew the defending army on the north bank to the new positions on the south bank, and at about 6:00 PM that night and 5:00 AM on the 18th, twice destroyed the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Jinpu Railway, a hub for north-south transportation. From the 18th, the two sides were in a tense stalemate across the river, causing the war situation to enter a new stage. Most of the railway stations along the Jinpu Railway in northern Shandong and nearby counties also fell. As for remote county towns, the true situation is unknown due to traffic obstruction. The Japanese artillery fire sometimes bombarded the Jinan urban area from the vicinity of Queshan. Civilian casualties in Jinan are heard of every day. Japanese planes also constantly flew to major stations and counties along the Jinpu Line in southern Shandong and dropped bombs. Even the areas along the south bank of the Yellow River and the moored sailing ships were sometimes attacked by Japanese planes. What remains is that the intact buildings in the central urban area of Jinan have not been destroyed. In this situation, the general public in the city maintained a considerable degree of prosperity with an attitude of numbness and calmness, while the atmosphere of depression and panic was particularly strong.</p>
<p>The Japanese army on the north bank has become more active in the past two days. From 8:00 AM to 2:50 PM on the 4th of this month, artillery from the vicinity of Queshan continuously bombarded the south bank, firing about 150 shells, intending to destroy factories, transportation, and artillery positions. About 20 shells landed in the open space about half a kilometer northeast of the Japanese Burning Bone Factory on Weishi Road, and more than 10 shells landed in the north training ground of the Xinzhuang Barracks, causing little loss. More than 10 shells landed on a barracks, destroying five or six buildings and injuring one person. Seven or eight shells landed on Wuyingshan, causing no loss. One shell landed on the fiber root west of the Lufeng Yarn Factory, and more than 10 shells landed on Black Mountain. One shell landed on the Tianqiao west of the Jinpu Railway (at Dahuaishu), injuring a donkey. One shell landed on the nine-track switch inside the Jinpu Factory, destroying one section of the track and two ties, and injuring an electrical worker. One shell landed on the engine factory, injuring two workers. One shell landed on the material factory, causing no loss. On this day, our side also fired back with artillery, firing more than 10 shells, killing quite a few. At 7:00 AM on the 5th, the Japanese army fired a few more shells at us and then stopped. At about 11:00 PM at night, a small unit suddenly attempted to cross the river to Wangjia Wharf and Xingjia Ferry near Lishan County in northwestern Licheng County. They were severely defended by our guarding troops and fired at across the river. The Japanese army did not succeed. Clear gunfire and artillery fire could be heard in the Jinan commercial port area, and it stopped around 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>In the past few days, our Liu Yueting and Chang Buyun guerrilla units have repeatedly operated on the north bank, successively recovering Buping, Renping, Qianxian, Putai, Lijin, Zhanhua, Wudi, and other counties next to the railway to the south. The local public security in each of these counties has now returned to normal. (December 5)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Japanese Warships Between Jinmen and Xiamen</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Bombarding Our Side</p>
<p>Southern Fujian Remains Stable as Usual</p>
<p>Xiamen University Moves to Changting to Start Classes</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: As of the 2nd of this month, the number of Japanese warships anchored in and outside the ports of Jinmen and Xiamen has increased to fifteen. Nine ships are in the port of Jinmen and along the coast, and six ships are in the sea area between Xiamen and Jinmen. The original 200 marines had only a little over 130 stationed on Jinmen Island, and none on Lieyu Island. It was said that a team was sent from Jinmen to patrol on the 1st and 2nd. However, in the past five days, Japanese warships have continued to bombard: ㊀ At 8:40 AM on the 2nd, six shells were fired at Dadeng Island, which belongs to Jinmen County. Starting at 10:00 AM, another 26 shells were fired at Dadeng and the Lianhe coastline of Nan'an, which is behind Dadeng, ceasing at 1:00 PM. During the shelling of Dadeng, two speedboats carrying thirty to forty marines were launched, attempting to land on Dadeng Island under the cover of fire. Our defending troops and militia sunk both boats, and more than ten marines were killed or wounded. Two of our residents were killed or wounded. That night, Japanese warships continuously illuminated Dadeng with searchlights. ㊁ At 9:05 PM on the 3rd, Japanese warships again shelled Jishan Township on Dadeng Island with more than twenty shells, ceasing at 10:30 PM. ㊂ At 1:50 PM on the 5th, Japanese warships again shelled Wutong and Hecuo in the northern part of Jinmen Island, ceasing at 3:30 PM, firing more than ten shells in total. ㊃ At 11:00 AM on the 6th, Japanese warships again shelled Wutong and Hecuo with twenty-five shells, ceasing at 12:00 noon. In the four bombardments over the past five days, apart from the two residents killed or wounded on Dadeng, there were no other losses, as the shells all fell on barren land. Residents in Aotou and Liuwudian along the coast of Xiamen and Tong'an, and Lianhe in Nan'an, are at ease and not alarmed. Inland port and land transportation, and all personnel matters, are as usual, without any change. The residents of Dadeng Island have all been evacuated, leaving only the defending troops and armed volunteer militia. Jinmen Island has been declared "extinct," with soldiers using coarse wheat as food, and Jinmen residents who have not escaped using sweet potatoes instead of rice. White rice is almost a memory. Occasionally, smuggled rice arrives in Jinmen, and those with some assets compete to buy it, selling for more than three yuan per dou (15.5 jin). Recently, the Japanese have allowed our fishermen to go to sea to fish, but each boat must offer two dou of white rice and twenty jin of salt each time they go to sea to exchange for a Japanese flag before they can fish. 20% of the fish and chickens they catch must also be extracted. The Japanese are also using surplus white sugar produced in Taiwan this year and cloth that cannot be exported from Japan to obtain white rice from fishermen and farmers along the coast of the country and provinces. The method is to exchange two packages of white sugar for one package of rice, and cloth is similarly exchanged. Southern Fujian has had a bumper harvest this year, and late rice is being sold as it enters the market. Ignorant and foolish people, hearing of those who secretly transport rice to Jinmen, have had several cases intercepted by the navy in recent days. In addition, a severe epidemic has recently broken out in Jinmen. There is no medicine, and nine out of ten die. In recent days, in Houbu, Anqi, Huwei, Qionglin, and other villages, one hundred fifty to sixty people have died. Forty to fifty Japanese soldiers have also died. There is a shortage of wood, and there is no way to obtain coffins. Other supplies, such as fresh water and fuel, are extremely difficult. Although Japanese soldiers are constantly returning to Taiwan in batches to replenish supplies, it is still not sufficient. Therefore, recently they have declared that in addition to occupying Jinmen, they will occupy several other coastal areas of Fujian Province as supply stations for the sea, land, and air forces in South China. However, our garrison has long been prepared to deal with it.</p>
<p>After the Japanese warships first attacked Xiamen on September 3rd, one British and one American warship were stationed in Xiamen, which is a regular occurrence. Between the 2nd and 5th of this month, one British warship and two American warships were added, reaching a total of five. On the 6th, three Japanese warships left Xiamen and returned to port. Currently, one British and one American warship remain anchored in Xiamen.</p>
<p>Southern Fujian has had a bumper harvest in various places this year, and late rice is entering the market. Rice prices have fallen sharply. There is no need to worry about food shortages this winter and spring. In addition, winter cultivation is vigorously carried out in various places, and the harvests are sufficient to supplement the shortage during the green and yellow interlude between spring and summer next year. Nan'an County can produce 600,000 yuan worth of sugarcane, and Huangtian Xianyou is expected to reach 2,000,000 yuan. These are all new agricultural production this year.</p>
<p>In terms of tax revenue, the import tax from Hailan has sharply decreased, but the entrepot tax compensates for this, and it can still reach 60% of the usual total revenue. The Zhangchuan Hailan branch card collected 40,000 yuan in entrepot tax from October 15th to the end of November, and the rest can be inferred. After Xiamen was opened, the average daily tax revenue was 500,000 yuan. It decreased to 130,000 yuan in September. The new entrepot tax increased to 230,000 yuan in October. December has not yet been announced, but it may reach 300,000 yuan. The salt tax in Quanzhou has been particularly good in recent months, with a monthly income of more than 200,000 yuan. The provincial tax supervision was originally only 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per month, but the ten counties of Quanzhou reached one-third of this, which is also a good sign that has not been seen in the past.</p>
<p>Xiamen University originally planned to move to Gulangyu for classes this semester, but now it has been decided to move to Changting County in western Fujian. A location has been found and preparations are underway. Classes will be temporarily suspended on the 12th, and the relocation will begin on the 15th. Classes will continue in Changting on January 4th next year. Important books, instruments, and applications will be moved along with the university. Those valuable books, instruments, and specimens that were collected but are not necessary for teaching were packed into more than twenty large boxes last month and temporarily transported to Hong Kong for preservation.

<h3>Shanghai Refugees on the Streets in Severe Cold Weather</h3>
<p>— (International Press)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Begins to Destroy the Jiangyin Blockade Line</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Fly Low to Reconnoiter Jiangbei Counties</p>
<p>Traffic Between Shanghai and Tongzhou and Yangzhou is Not Obstructed</p>
<p>Nantong Dispatch: Since the fall of Jiangyin, a large number of Japanese transport ships have passed through Tongzhou and Sizhou for days, carrying engineers to destroy the blockade line on the Jiangyin-Jingjiang river surface. However, the number of ships sunk there is as high as forty or more, and the area is densely covered with mines, making it difficult for the Japanese army to carry out the destruction work. Currently, there are no attempts on the Jiangbei side. Jingjiang is still guarded by our large army. On the evening of the 5th, Japanese planes flew to Jingjiang and dropped four bombs at the East Gate, destroying the Jiangsu Bank and Qingyu Pawnshop. The Japanese side has now dispatched four seaplanes that are permanently anchored on the Jiang surface of Langshan Mountain in Nantong, flying over Jiangbei counties from time to time to circle and reconnoiter. The flights are extremely low, only 200 meters above Tongcheng. Air raid alarms are incessant from morning to night, but fortunately, no bombs have been dropped. The people here are still calm, and the local area is peaceful as usual. A curfew is in effect every night from 10:00 PM. Navigation between Shanghai and Nantong is normal. Seven steamships travel back and forth between Nantong and Yangzhou, and traffic is still unobstructed. The Yuji Xing and other eight firms of the Shanghai Local Produce Industry Association have specially chartered the British merchant Moller Company's Mawei Miller barge to Tongzhou to purchase vegetables for Shanghai, and have transported a large number of pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. Fresh meat is prohibited from being imported into Shanghai. More than seventy slaughterhouses in Tianshenggang have all closed down. (7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Wounded Generals and Colonels Can Enter the Army University</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army authorities announced on the 10th that among the young Army generals and colonels who were wounded on the North China and Shanghai battle lines after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, those who wish to enter the Army University and are qualified to be active-duty soldiers are eligible to enter the Army University or become specialist students.

<h3>Ningbo Factories and Shops Close Down</h3>
<p>Due to the Impact of Air Raids</p>
<p>The Commissioner's Office Urges Them to Open</p>
<p>Ningbo Dispatch: The Administrative Inspector Commissioner's Office of the Sixth District of Zhejiang Province, considering that most factories, businesses, and shops in the urban area of Ningbo have closed down since the air raids, which is not a way for long-term resistance, summoned the responsible persons of various industries and persuaded them to open. On the 9th, it sent a telegram to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, stating, "This city is a major port for sea and land in eastern Zhejiang, and its commercial prosperity has always been the best in the province. If it is allowed to decline, it will not only reduce production but also have a profound impact on the long-term resistance, and the number of unemployed will increase day by day. At this time of cold weather and the end of the year, it is inevitable that people will be forced by food and clothing, causing hidden dangers in the local area. It is hereby urgently telegraphed to the Chamber of Commerce to persuade various industries again, explaining the meaning of this, so that those who have not resumed business should find ways to resume business, and those who have resumed business should expand as much as possible. There are high hopes." (9th)</p>

<h3>The Deeper the Japanese Army Penetrates Inland, the Greater the Difficulties Acknowledged by Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Even Germans Are Gradually Feeling Anxious</p>
<p>Ishii Remains in Britain for Two Months</p>
<p>[London] According to today's news, Viscount Ishii, the Japanese special envoy who arrived here from Rome and Paris four days ago, will stay in Britain for two months. Important figures in British business and political circles are now preparing to meet with him. However, Ishii has not made any statements to the newspapers so far. The general impression is that Ishii's mission to Britain is to induce Britain to tacitly approve Japan's plan to organize local governments in the occupied areas, in exchange for Japan's concessions on the Shanghai Customs issue. At the same time, what kind of developments will occur if Nanjing falls is also a matter of much speculation. The peaceful atmosphere that was previously believed to exist in China is now believed to no longer exist. What is deeply regrettable is that China's honor seems to require the glorious sacrifice of Nanjing. General observers all believe that as Japan occupies more and more Chinese land, the difficulties it encounters also increase. An editorial in the Observer commented that Soviet Russia's dispatch of troops may cause Japan to turn victory into defeat, and said that the only way to consolidate British and American power is to refuse to aid Japan with money and other means. Although the organized boycott of Japanese goods movement in various parts of Britain is now silent, those who buy Christmas supplies now often ask in shops whether they are Japanese goods. If they hear that they are Japanese goods, they often refuse to buy them. People in the Lancashire cotton industry have written to the Ministry of Commerce and members of Parliament, advocating that tariffs be increased on Japanese goods to counteract the low exchange rate of the Japanese currency. Kido, a Japanese publisher in London, wrote a letter to The Times, saying that Japan only wants to seek lasting peace in the Far East, and Britain should try to understand Japan's purpose. This is the only way for Britain to protect its great interests in China. (11th Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the war between China and Japan, the impression of observers here is that Japan has almost "eaten too much." Even if Nanjing is captured, the difficulties it encounters will not be reduced as a result. There are only two paths to follow in the future: one is to establish puppet local governments in the areas it occupies, and the other is to pressure the current Chinese government after military victory to obtain concessions that General Chiang Kai-shek has already rejected. Regarding this matter, American diplomatic circles believe that Japan should take the second approach, because if Japan establishes puppet governments in various places against the will of the people, it will have to use force to protect them due to the resolute resistance of Chinese public opinion, which is not a good strategy. It will also be a great financial sacrifice. (10th Havas)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The impact of Japan's deepening into the interior of China on Germany's economic interests in China is now gradually causing concern among Germans. The German Daily News said that the Japanese seem willing to invite other countries to participate in China's construction, but the issue of credit is crucial in Japan. In this regard, Britain and the United States are stronger than us. The characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon nation is to adjust the situation it does not want first, and then it is willing to establish a business relationship with the victor. (11th Reuters)</p>
<h3>The United States Decides to Withdraw Part of Its Troops Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Large-Scale Pacific Maneuver Will Be Held Next Spring</p>
<p>The British Naval Commander Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong</p>
<p>[Washington] The US Navy Department announced today that the Sixth Regiment of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will withdraw to the United States aboard the transport ship Chaumont. This matter will be decided by Admiral Yarnell, the commander-in-chief of the US Asiatic Fleet. However, the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps will remain stationed in China, so it cannot be regarded as the United States withdrawing all its troops stationed in China. The Sixth Regiment of the Marine Corps, which is being withdrawn, left San Diego for Shanghai on September 19th and is now returning to that port. It is reported that Yarnell will also take the flagship Augusta to Manila. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Sixth Regiment of the US Marine Corps left the port of San Diego, California for Shanghai on September 19th, which has been more than two months. The government has now decided to recall it, and the naval transport ship Chaumont has already sailed to Shanghai. In addition, the US naval authorities intend to withdraw all the Marine Corps when the situation in Shanghai returns to normal. (10th Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to authoritative sources here, the United States will hold a large-scale naval exercise in the eastern Pacific in March and April next year, commanded by Admiral Bloch. The scale of the exercise is unprecedented, with 175 naval units, 500 aircraft, and 6,000 naval soldiers participating. (11th Haitong)</p>
<p>[London] Rear Admiral Littlejohn, the British naval commander in China, has now left Shanghai for Hong Kong. The only British warship anchored in Shanghai is the cruiser "Folkestone". (11th Haitong)</p>
<p>[London] The journal "Great Britain and the Orient" today published an article by journalist Barrett, saying that Shanghai Customs is now in the hands of the Japanese. Hong Kong is the only remaining obstacle to Japan's control of the Far East and is extremely important. It must be strictly defended. If Hong Kong remains a center of Chinese and British culture, a concentration of commerce, and a base for the British Navy, then Japan will never be able to do whatever it wants to China. Barrett strongly advocates that Hong Kong should be defended with heavy troops to ensure its safety and prevent it from being encroached upon, especially against aircraft from Taiwan. The key to British policy today and in the future is to keep Hong Kong intact and properly protected, because it is the last remaining open door to China. (11th Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Holds Its First General Election</h3>
<p>The Stalin Faction Will Surely Win</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Union will hold its first general election tomorrow since the establishment of the Soviet government. There are 1,143 electoral districts, but most of the candidates are predetermined. There will be competition in only two places. From this, it can be seen that the election is just a formality. The victory of the Stalin faction is predictable. (11th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The name of Mezhlauk, Vice-Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat, was suddenly removed from the list of parliamentary candidates and replaced by Krenkel, a radio operator of the Soviet Arctic expedition currently on an ice floe. The whole country was amazed. At the same time, newspapers, speakers, and radio stations across the country urged the people not to give up their right to vote, praised the Soviet system, and praised Stalin's contributions to world peace. They also urged the people to fight against fascism and the Trotskyists and not to forgive them. Tomorrow is the voting day, and it is expected to pass quietly. (11th Reuters)</p>

<h3>There Is Talk of Replacing the US Ambassador to Britain</h3>
<p>Various Speculations About the Reason</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's intention to appoint banker Kennedy as the Ambassador to Britain is puzzling to political circles. Kennedy has always been the link between the President and the big business community. He served as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. After resigning in September 1935, he returned to serve as the chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission. His sudden transfer abroad is worthy of attention. The Senate is quite satisfied with this, but it also believes that Kennedy is needed domestically. Perhaps President Roosevelt believes that British-American relations will inevitably become closer in the future, and various outstanding issues need to be resolved urgently, so he has entrusted this important task to his most capable talent. However, there is another theory, that is, since the President appointed the anti-Catholic Ku Klux Klan member Sirk as a Supreme Court Justice, the Catholic community has been quite dissatisfied, and Kennedy is a Catholic, so his appointment may be to restore the goodwill of the Catholic community.

<h3>Palestinian Anti-British Elements</h3>
<p>Two Factions, About Sixty People</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Regarding the activities of terrorist factions in Palestine, the British authorities have taken various measures to suppress them in recent weeks, and these activities have been severely hit. According to police investigations, this faction is divided into two groups, each with about sixty members. One operates in northern Palestine, and the other operates in southern Palestine. Both receive financial and military assistance from abroad. Arab and Jewish people, seeing the constant emergence of terrorist means, fear that if they continue to confront each other, they will suffer together, so they have requested the British authorities to resolve the current dispute as soon as possible so that order can be restored.

<h3>Negotiations Between Britain and Germany on Colonial Issues Have Reached a Deadlock</h3>
<p>Germany Is Unwilling to Resolve It in Conjunction with the European Situation</p>
<p>Britain Also Has No Intention of Taking Active Action</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Germany's demand to recover its former colonies, Foreign Minister Neurath reportedly stated when he met with British Ambassador Henderson yesterday that it would not be convenient to use the overall solution to the European issue as an exchange condition. This was recently discussed by Foreign Secretary Eden with French Ambassador to Britain Corbin. Recent news from Berlin also claims that Germany intends to hold separate talks with its neighboring countries in order to resolve the issue of the treatment of minorities. After hearing the news, British political figures all believe that Germany's demands regarding its former colonies do not need to be resolved urgently, and for the time being, it is possible not to consult with the various autonomous territories and other mandated countries.

<h3>The Austrian Government Returns Royal Property</h3>
<p>But Not Necessarily a Restoration</p>
<p>[Vienna] The Austrian Cabinet ordered today that eleven Habsburg royal estates that were confiscated after the abolition of the monarchy be returned. The general public believes that this decision does not bring Austria closer to restoration but merely expresses Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg's sympathy with the principles of the monarchist faction. It is reported that the successor to the Austrian throne, Archduke Otto of Habsburg, recently toured the national army-controlled territory of northern Spain and went to the villa of his mother (the former Austrian Empress Zita) in Lequeitio, Biscay Bay. His father, Emperor Charles I of Austria-Hungary, also died in that villa in 1924. (10th Reuters)</p>
<h3>The French Chamber of Deputies Passes the Naval Budget</h3>
<p>More Than Two Billion Francs</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies recently unanimously passed the naval budget for 1938, the total amount of which is 2,191,000,000 francs. Naval Minister Campinchi said in a speech beforehand that all countries in the world are competing fiercely for the expansion of their navies. The total tonnage of new British warships under construction reaches 400,000 tons. The naval shipbuilding programs of Italy and Germany are also accelerating. In recent years, France has also been able to build new ships due to the annual increase in the naval budget. Currently, there are 35,000-ton battleships under construction, including the "Jean Bart," which is expected to be completed in 1939, and the "Richelieu," which is expected to be completed in 1940.

<p>[Paris] The French police discovered that someone was plotting to assassinate Foreign Minister Delbos during his visit to Central European countries. The news shocked the country today. A Hungarian man was arrested after crossing the French-Hungarian border, carrying coded letters, which led to the discovery. The assassin planned to assassinate Delbos when he arrived in Prague on the 15th. It is reported that Algerian Governor Le Beau was also one of the intended assassination targets. Based on information from the French police authorities, the Czech authorities arrested a Czech man who was disabled due to military service. The French government did not provide him with compensation, so he was angry and resorted to this vicious plot. Since the case was discovered, Delbos's protection during his trip has been more thorough, and at the same time, the authorities have issued arrest warrants to arrest several people related to the case.

<p>Lille: The police in this city recently discovered a conspiracy to assassinate Foreign Minister Delbos. A Hungarian terrorist named Goloman was arrested near Valenciennes in this city last month for suspicious behavior. After a thorough investigation by the local police authorities, two letters sent to Goloman were intercepted a few days ago. The sending location was the Czech capital. The letters were written in code. After being translated into plain text, it was learned that the sender was demanding money from Goloman in order to prepare everything and wait for French Foreign Minister Delbos to arrive in the Czech capital and assassinate him. After learning of this conspiracy, the police authorities, in addition to writing to the Czech authorities to arrest the sender, also brought Goloman to trial. After questioning, it was learned that he used to practice law in the Hungarian capital and had participated in the destruction of the Czech embassy and the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva. He was also suspected of being an accomplice in the assassination of Yugoslav King Alexander I in Marseille in 1934. (10th Havas)</p>

<h3>Mussolini Makes Another Astonishing Statement</h3>
<p>Fascist Party Supreme Council's Decision Spurs Various Rumors</p>
<p>[Rome] It is widely expected that when Prime Minister Mussolini announces the withdrawal from the League of Nations from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia, he will make an astonishing concession to the German-Italian Axis, declaring the return of the German East African Jubaland, obtained after the European War, to Germany. Jubaland is an extremely small area, originally part of British East Africa, connected to the Juba River, and now part of Italian Somaliland. According to the Anglo-Italian Treaty of July 15, 1924, Britain ceded the Juba River and a strip of British coastal land from fifty to one hundred miles wide to Italy. The main city of this area is Kismayo, and its main exports are ostrich feathers, ebony, gum, and banana fiber, etc. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian people are very doubtful about Prime Minister Mussolini's declaration. All phrases involving the League of Nations have been deleted from various reports. However, according to general opinion, Mussolini fears that he will not only announce his withdrawal from the League of Nations, but will also declare that he will seek political cooperation with countries that do not recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. It is expected that Mussolini will declare that he has been engaged in stabilizing Europe, but the democratic countries insist on not cooperating with him. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Fascist Party Supreme Council is scheduled to convene a meeting at 10 PM today. Before the meeting, the Cabinet will first hold a meeting at 8 PM. Afterwards, Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver a declaration to the masses from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia. The Fascist Party Supreme Council meeting is expected to be very short. By 10 PM, all theaters and cinemas will temporarily suspend performances so that the public can listen to the decisions taken by the Supreme Council via radio broadcast. There are various rumors about the content of this decision. In addition to the decision on Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, some say that Crown Prince Umberto will be crowned Emperor of Italy, others say that the Fascist Party will be reorganized, and others say that Italy will cede part of its African territory to Germany. Such rumors have been spreading everywhere for the past two days. No one knows whether they are credible, but it can be asserted that this meeting will have astonishing decisions.

<h3>British Labor Party Leader Tours Spain</h3>
<p>Returns Home to Discuss Impressions</p>
<p>[London] British Labour Party leader Attlee recently returned here from Spain and told people, "Anyone who thinks the Spanish government has been defeated is completely wrong." He also said that his impression of Spain was that the Spanish government had great confidence. It is impossible for the Nationalist Army to capture Madrid. At present, there is no possibility of reconciliation between the government and the Nationalist Army. It is expected that the war will be prolonged, causing great suffering to the Spanish people. According to the information he obtained, there are about 10,000 foreigners fighting in the Spanish Nationalist Army, and the Nationalist Army has about 600,000 to 700,000 troops. According to reports, when Attlee went to Spain this time, he was accompanied by Labour Party members Ms. Wilkinson and Mr. Noel-Baker. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Personal Liberation Advocated by the Bishop of Paris</h3>
<p>Revolution Will Arise Without Freedom</p>
<p>[Paris] The Bishop of Paris, Verdier, delivered a speech at the Ambassador Theatre today, strongly condemning the dictatorial system and praising the free system. He advocated personal liberation, stating that human equality is necessary, and said, "Some people in the world often impose chains on others. If these chains are not removed, then mankind must continue to strive for liberation. If the class that sacrifices is not liberated, then where will the revolution end? The Christian Church has always declared to the world that all human beings belong to the same ancestor and should share the inheritance of paradise. The Church values the individual more than any political faction. To say that the individual should be absorbed by the collective, that the state is like a large machine, and that the individual is swallowed up by it, this kind of statement is not accepted by us. We believe that individual personality is more important than everything else. Whether individual, institution, organization, or state, all should serve freedom. If one wants to replace individual personality with idols or other sects, then human freedom will be completely swept away. France is the eldest son of the Christian Church and has been the defender and promoter of people's freedom for centuries. This historical fact and mission should be engraved in our hearts forever."

<h3>Foreign Newspaper Reports on the Search of Households in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Residents in the Area Are Anxious</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that, according to Chinese sources, armed Japanese soldiers were still searching Chinese residences in the road-building area outside the Shanghai International Settlement, such as Yuyuan Road and Great Western Road, house by house yesterday (the 10th). As a result, residents in the area are very anxious. It is now known that four Chinese people have been detained and have not yet been released. As for whether there are other similar cases, it was not possible to find out yesterday. The detainees are the Yan family of four, and two servants. The two servants have been released yesterday. According to Chinese opinion, Yan's arrest may be due to his film production business, which offended the Japanese. The Japanese claim that they are afraid that the area contains military supplies left by the Chinese army, so they are inspecting house by house.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a Chinese man named Yan and others living outside the International Settlement on Jessfield Road were detained by armed Japanese soldiers on Thursday. According to a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) yesterday, although the road-building area outside the Shanghai International Settlement is managed by the SMC, the land on both sides of the road is still under Chinese jurisdiction. Now that the Japanese army has occupied Shanghai, they may demand the right to take over the police administration of the area. Therefore, the SMC has no right to interfere with Yan's detention, because legally speaking, the land belongs to China.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Chinese man named Yan and others who were detained by Japanese soldiers on Yuyuan Road in the road-building area outside the International Settlement two days ago have not yet been released. It is heard that the detainees are being guarded by Japanese soldiers at the No. 3 plant of the Public Works Department. The SMC authorities do not want to interfere with this matter because the area is not under the SMC's jurisdiction. The road-building area outside the International Settlement is still patrolled by the police of the Shanghai International Settlement. If the Japanese army intends to take over the police affairs of the roads or send armed patrols to the area, the SMC seems to be preparing to lodge a protest. However, the problem is very complicated and may inevitably cause disputes in the future.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Subcommittee Needs 10,000 Gold Pieces Daily for Rations</h3>
<p>The Subcommittee Accommodates Over 56,000 People, Urgently Needs Constant Donations from All Parties, the Municipal Federation Sends Letters to Public Organizations for Relief</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Subcommittee of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association currently accommodates over 56,000 refugees. The cost of providing rations for the refugees is very high every day. The subcommittee has compiled the following statistics on the daily rations needed for each refugee: (A) Rice: the daily ration cost for each refugee is 102.9 cash, with rice accounting for 82.62%, vegetables accounting for 7.76%, and fuel accounting for 9.62%. (B) Flour: each refugee needs 84.2 cash per day for rations, with flour accounting for 85.51%, salt accounting for 2.73%, and fuel accounting for 11.76%. According to this calculation, the subcommittee needs a total of 10,477.6 yuan per day for rations. The subcommittee has no funds and relies solely on donations from all parties. As the weather is severely cold and refugees are starving and freezing, the supply of rations to refugees cannot be interrupted for a single day, and there is also a lack of clothing and bedding for the refugees. It is hoped that local people will be charitable and generous, and donate constantly to maintain relief efforts. The merit is immeasurable and surpasses building a seven-storied pagoda.</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union sent a letter to public organizations yesterday, saying that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the war zone has expanded daily. Refugees from towns and cities near Shanghai are flocking to Shanghai. The refugee shelters of various charitable organizations are overcrowded, and the refugees sleeping on the streets are still a shocking sight. The union has organized a refugee relief committee and has established a shelter at No. 6 Wanmao Lane, Tiantong Road, actively accommodating refugees wandering along the streets. However, the supply of rations is cumbersome, and there is also a lack of clothing and bedding to ward off the cold. A method for raising funds and goods has been formulated to petition for the refugees. The union has always admired your organization's enthusiasm for charity and sympathy for the relief of compatriots. A special letter is sent, requesting your assistance in promoting donations to benefit the disaster victims. The union also received continued one-cent donations from various sectors yesterday, including 500 yuan from China Ham Company, 300 yuan from Sanyou Industrial Company, 15 yuan from Chen Benyan, 9 yuan from Lin Shimin, 38 yuan collected by Gu Kemin, 3 yuan from Renxing Egg Company, and 3 yuan per month from Gu Yucang, Cao Zhigong, Liu Zhongying, and Li Boling.</p>
<h3>Post-War Remnants in the Caohejing Area</h3>
<p>Catholic Church District Shelters Refugees, Three Corpses Seen Beside Jinrong Pavilion</p>
<p>Yesterday, a foreigner came to Shanghai via Caohejing Town. According to him, he traveled from Xieqiao in the South City to Caohejing along Xieshi Road. The road was quiet and deserted, like entering a wilderness. The Rihui Port Bridge was damaged when our army firmly defended the South City, but it has now been repaired and cars can pass without hindrance. The area west of Tianyaoqiao Road and north of Xieshi Road has been temporarily designated as a Catholic Church district, temporarily managed by priests, sheltering a large number of refugees, no less than the refugee district in the Western District. The district extends from Tushanwan in the west to the railway, covering a considerable area. The garden of Mr. Cao, a cloth merchant, at the southern end of Humin South Road, Zhongshan Road, is still intact and has troops stationed inside. The Jinrong Bridge at the east entrance of Caohejing was previously reported to be damaged by bombing, but it has been repaired and traffic is normal. Looking west from the top of the bridge, the entire town is in sight. None of the houses in the town show any damage. The four-story factory of Guanshengyuan still stands tall. A dozen or so bungalows along the bank at the intersection of Bijiao Road were destroyed by fire. The prison buildings are still intact. Further west, the Guanghua Glue Factory, along the road, a portion of the houses have been reduced to ashes, but the rear thatched houses are still in good condition. There is a corpse beside Jinrong Pavilion, and a total of three corpses were seen nearby. The dead were all male, and had been dead for a long time, their skin turning black. The Huangjia Garden is now used as a dormitory for a certain unit, with more than twenty horses tied outside the Four Teaching Hall. Behind it, more than twenty rows of bungalows, including the east and west halls, kitchens, and dining rooms of the Guandi Temple, have been completely burned. Only the surrounding walls remain. The two-courtyard Huang Ancestral Hall in the western part of the garden has also been burned. The deer, cranes, variegated birds, white bears, and other animals kept in the garden are all gone. Other houses, springs, rocks, trees are as good as old, only a mess. It is heard that the residence of Zhang Xinhe in the town is used by the stationed troops as a headquarters. He paid much attention to seeking out residents, but never saw anyone, only encountered a ten-year-old village child in front of Huangjia Garden.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Line on the Huangpu River Is Still Not Open to Navigation</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Is Still Negotiating</p>
<p>After the ferries of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s subsidiary, Lih He Yang Hang, Xin Jiangnan, Lao Jiangnan, and Xiao Jiangnan, joined the Gaoqiao line of ferries, following the ferries of Moller &amp; Co., Miller and Dina, to ferry passengers and load vegetables, the traffic on the Huangpu River, although Yangjing and Donggou were not open, was still convenient with the Gaoqiao line. However, the Gaoqiao line, which had not been restored for a week, was blocked again on the 10th. The ferries of Moller &amp; Co. and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. were all suspended, causing anxiety among the general public and vegetable vendors traveling between Pudong and Puxi. These people rely on selling vegetables for a living and making meager profits. Now that the source of their livelihood has been blocked again, the impact on them is obvious. Therefore, there were many people gathered at the Bund wharf, inquiring about news of resumption of navigation. Yesterday afternoon, inquiries were made to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. about the resumption of navigation on the Gaoqiao line. According to them, everything is still under negotiation and reconciliation. It is still uncertain whether the future will allow it, so the date of resumption of navigation on the line is still unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Handles Entrusted Inquiries</h3>
<p>Limited to Wuxing for the Time Being, a Fee of Four Yuan per Inquiry</p>
<p>The Lake Society of this city, due to the interruption of traffic between Lake and Shanghai and the lack of news, has sent a special commissioner back to his hometown to facilitate the inquiry of fellow villagers about the recent situation of their families. The society has established the following methods for fellow villagers to entrust inquiries: ㊀ The location of this inquiry is temporarily limited to "Wuxing city and nearby villages and towns." ㊁ The matters of inquiry are stipulated as follows: A. Where is the family currently living? B. Is the population safe? C. Is there any loss of houses and property? D. Recent situation ㊂ Special commissioners will be dispatched when there are 15 or more family inquiries entrusted each time. ㊃ Each entrusted inquiry requires a fee of 4 yuan to cover the commissioner's travel expenses. ㊄ Those who entrust family inquiries must register with the society in advance and pay the required fees. ㊅ When the commissioner returns to Shanghai, he will immediately notify the entrustees to come to the society to listen to the inquiry report. ㊆ If the person being inquired about is not at the original address, but is proved by relatives and friends, it is also considered a valid investigation, and the fees collected will not be refunded. ㊇ If the entrusted family cannot be inquired due to various reasons, the fees collected will be refunded by half. ㊈ If the commissioner is obstructed on the way or encounters an accident and fails to achieve the purpose of the inquiry, the fees collected will be refunded in full after verification. The society is currently preparing inquiry forms and will depart as soon as fellow villagers entrust their inquiries.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Administration Is Financially Exhausted</h3>
<p>Inconvenient Transportation Leads to a Sharp Decline in Mail, Many Postal Workers Retreat to Shanghai</p>
<p>It is learned that the postal economy of the Shanghai Postal Administration has been increasingly exhausted recently, which is unprecedented since the establishment of postal bureaus in our country. The general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Mail</p>
<p>Postal revenue has always been dominated by parcels. Since the abolition of the domestic transshipment tax on mailed parcels the year before last, it has become increasingly prosperous. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, transportation has been the first to be affected. The number of places where parcels are suspended for mailing has increased daily. As for other mail such as letters, it has also been greatly reduced due to the expansion of the war zone and the relocation of people. The situation of remittances and other matters is also the same, and is decreasing day by day, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Small Area, Many Employees</p>
<p>At the same time, postal workers from postal branch offices withdrawing from the war zone have returned to Shanghai one after another, and the bureau has had to properly accommodate and arrange them, resulting in a shrinking postal area and an increase in personnel. How can the postal economy not increase its difficulties? Moreover, it is difficult to expect these withdrawing postal workers to be transferred out or resume work in the short term. Therefore, the above-mentioned difficult situation is unprecedented in the forty-year history of China's own postal service.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Donation Week Ends Today, Over 70,000 Yuan Raised</h3>
<p>Red Cross Badges Also Cease to Be Sold, Dr. Shi Convenes a Propaganda and Fundraising Meeting</p>
<p>The Red Cross Donation Week held by the International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society was originally scheduled to end on the 8th, but was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances and is scheduled to end officially today. According to news last night, over 52,300 yuan has been raised from the 1st to the 8th. The exact amount from the 8th to last night has not been settled, but it should be around 20,000 yuan, so the total amount should be over 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Please Send Donations to the General Association</p>
<p>After the end of Red Cross Week, the support association office at No. 129 Nanjing Road will close this week. In the future, donations from all sectors should be sent directly to the office of the Secretary-General of the association on the fourth floor of No. 505 Henan Road (i.e., the address of the China International Famine Relief Commission).</p>
<p>Red Cross Badges Cease to Be Sold</p>
<p>In order to thank the donors, the association made a small silver circular badge with the Red Cross in both Chinese and English as a souvenir at the beginning of Red Cross Week. Since the movement has now ended, the circular shield badge will no longer be sold. It is hoped that those who donate and are charitable will pay attention.</p>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Convenes a Propaganda Meeting</p>
<p>Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the director of publicity and fundraising for the association and former ambassador to the United States, will convene a publicity meeting at the International Hotel at 3 PM tomorrow to make the situation of refugees in this city clear to all sectors at home and abroad and expand fundraising and publicity. In addition to the original committee members Guo Chengen, Zheng Lai, Mrs. Yang Shaonan, and Luo Chuanhua, former minister to Denmark Luo Zhongyan (Zhong Rui), Shanghai University President Liu Zhanen, and Mrs. Chen Kui will also be invited to participate.</p>
<p>Establish a Handicraft Committee</p>
<p>The association held its 9th Standing Committee meeting on the 10th and elected Liu Wang Liming, Xie Zuyi, Del, Li Guiyong, and Luo Rui as handicraft committee members to promote the production of county people.</p>
<h3>Police Situation in Pudong, Nanshi, and Zhabei</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the "Great Dao Municipal Government" in Pudong, its "Police Bureau" has been organized. Due to conflicting news in recent days, accurate information has not been obtained. A special investigation has now been added. The police teams currently established by the bureau are only in five locations: Lanni Ferry, Yangjing, Tangqiao, Yangjiadu, and Caojiadu. The head of the Lanni Ferry is surnamed Su, the head of the Yangjing is surnamed Zhou, the head of the Tangqiao is surnamed Zhang, and the head of the Caojiadu is surnamed Chen. In addition, the police brigade, water patrol team, and detective team claim to have been established, but there are few members and the scale is extremely simple. In Nanshi and Zhabei, only police pacification classes have been established, and no police bureaus or police teams have been established. The previous report that Zhou Jiaxiang and others were captains has been found to be untrue. According to relevant sources, the establishment of police agencies in Nanshi and Zhabei will first allow people to return to register, and after a certain number have returned, they will be dispersed. Therefore, in recent days, many pacification class personnel have been set up in the refugee areas, and leaflets have been distributed. These personnel are both male and female, and their title is Pacification Envoy. The people who went to Nanshi to register were all ordered to stay in Nanshi and provided with some food. At the same time, a detailed investigation was conducted in Nanshi. Approximately four-tenths of the houses were destroyed by fire. The East District of the Fire Brigade in Nanshi was slightly damaged by bombing, while the South District Fire Brigade was slightly damaged at the beginning of the war, and the West District Fire Brigade was completely preserved. Even the huge mansion of the Zhang family next door was not damaged, but beyond the Zhang family's house, from the storefronts of Taiheng Lane to the City Bank, it has been destroyed. The office of the old Inland Tap Water Company to the Chunsen Lumber Company at the intersection of Huangjiaque Road has been burned down. The City Police Bureau was not destroyed, the Dongjiadu Police Station was not destroyed, and the West Gate Branch Bureau was not damaged at all. There are many foreigners in the Local Court. The West City Elementary School now has a Pacification Class training center operating inside.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Towboat Still Missing</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that a towboat belonging to Jardine Matheson Tug &amp; Lighter Co., Ltd. has been missing since it was detained by Japanese sailors on Thursday. Last night (the 10th), a spokesman for the Japanese Navy announced that the Japanese naval authorities were unaware of the matter. The British authorities had verbally informed the Japanese Consul-General of the matter. After investigation, it was learned that the ship was not detained by Japanese sailors, and the Japanese naval authorities were very satisfied. When asked about this matter to the spokesman for the Japanese Army, the spokesman also said that he did not know about it. Responsible officials of the company were unable to make any comments on the matter last night. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy admitted that the British Consul-General had made verbal representations and that after investigation, the whereabouts of the ship could not be found.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Fellow Villagers Report on the Current Situation in Lake City</h3>

There are many people seeking refuge in the Shuangdu Yu Village area. Later, due to danger, they changed to other places.</p>
<h3>Ningbo and Other Places Are Very Peaceful Now</h3>
<p>The Trend of Relocation Has Subsided, the Number of Refugees Is Not Large</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai received a letter from the shelter established in Baiyi Temple in Ningbo yesterday, reporting that the current situation in various places in Ningbo is very peaceful. The relocation trend in the city and countryside has subsided. The number of people sheltered in the shelter is now just over 300 because a small number have voluntarily left the shelter and gone to the countryside. The shelter has also hired several Chinese and Western doctors to serve as volunteers to treat and examine the refugees. All supplies continue to be borne by the Ningbo Association.</p>
<h3>Pudong Forbids the Transportation of Grain and Vegetables to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Passengers Must Be Searched, All Return Empty-Handed</p>
<p>After the so-called "Great Dao Municipal Government" was established in Pudong, although the Dongchang Road ferry was opened, allowing residents to return to visit, the landing point is still very strict.

<h3>Silver and Money Industry Continues to Receive and Circulate Notes in the Market</h3>
<p>Extended Contract, Pending Approval from the Ministry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association previously had a contract with member firms to receive legal tender from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China and Bank of Communications for a term of two years, which expired at the end of November this year. At this extraordinary time, the market needs legal tender urgently, so it jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to approve the extension of the contract for two years, and sent a letter to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China and Bank of Communications for verification. Yesterday, it was learned from the Silver and Money Industry Association that although it has not received a reply from the Ministry of Finance approving the extension of the note-receiving contract for two years, due to the current factual needs, it will continue to receive and circulate notes in the market from December 1 in accordance with the previous regulations.</p>
<h3>YMCA Jointly Holds Christmas Day for Disaster Children</h3>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Philanthropists Painstakingly Set Up Refugee Zones; Japanese Soldiers Began Searching Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese Teachers Arrested and Tortured by Japanese Soldiers; Female Teachers and Virgin Nuns Allowed to Leave the Zone</p>
<p>According to the English newspaper "The China Press," at approximately 2:30 PM today, martial law was declared in the Nanshi (Southern City) Safety Zone, with警戒 lines set up in the four districts of the zone, and a house-by-house search began. By 4:00 PM, three Chinese teachers, all in handcuffs, had been arrested by Japanese soldiers and taken away. As the search continues, it is feared that more people will be arrested. A Japanese spokesperson, when meeting with news reporters tonight, declared that Japanese military authorities expanded the patrol lines today and conducted a house-by-house search in the Nanshi Safety Zone, taking over the area and believing they will permanently occupy it. This action is being carried out in accordance with the policy announced by the Japanese military before capturing Nanshi. The reason given is that a Japanese sentry was shot by an unknown person, who has not yet been apprehended. This matter was quickly reported to Father Jacquinot. Although the administrative power of the zone will gradually be transferred to the Japanese military, it is not expected to interfere with the work of the committee. Father Jacquinot, the chairman of the international committee managing the zone, could not be visited this afternoon. The other committee members all appeared to be willing to remain silent. When asked about the situation, they all answered by referring to Father Jacquinot. All the committee members acknowledged that the Japanese military clearly had some purpose, perhaps to search for and arrest individuals. The Japanese military's arrest of the three teachers involved breaking down the door of a certain school. Several Chinese female teachers and several foreign Catholic virgin nuns in the school were detained for several minutes, but were later allowed to leave the area. It is now believed that the school is run by the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order. Competition between the Japanese military and the International Red Cross in the Nanshi refugee camps was also discovered today. It is learned that the Japanese military had set up three refugee camps three days ago. Although some Chinese people were not forced to leave the Safety Zone, the Japanese military has urged them to enter the refugee camps they have established, one of which is located in the Confucian Temple. This afternoon, there were no pedestrians on Minguo Road. All streets and alleys leading into Nanshi were guarded by Japanese soldiers holding rifles with fixed bayonets, at least one soldier at each location. Several pitiful Chinese people were seen walking in the streets of Nanshi, apparently unmolested by the Japanese soldiers. During the Japanese military's search of the zone, the doors of several houses were broken open. It is now believed that this action by the Japanese military was completely unexpected by the Safety Zone Committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Distribute Chinese Leaflets in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>Crossing the American Military Defense Zone, Shouting for a Long Time Before Withdrawing</p>
<p>According to the English newspaper "The China Press," at 9:30 AM this morning (the 11th), approximately 25 Japanese soldiers, led by three officers, entered the western district of the Public Settlement from western Zhabei, passing along Jiaozhou Road to Robison Road. All the soldiers carried rifles with fixed bayonets and distributed Chinese leaflets along the way. Last night, there was a disturbance in the American military defense zone in western Shanghai. Ten Japanese soldiers sneaked across obstacles to a certain Japanese-run yarn factory. After being discovered by American soldiers, they shouted for a long time and ordered them to withdraw from the area.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog on Zhejiang Sea Delays Arrival of Tribute Rice in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Grain Merchants Ship Three Batches of Foreign Rice on the Athenian; Spot Goods Scarce, Whole Bags Rise to 19.8 Yuan</p>
<p>The second batch of foreign rice from Yongda Grain Company and the fifth batch of foreign rice from French firm Dreyfus, totaling 51,000 bags, were shipped to Shanghai on the Chengdu and Margerethe Siemers. They were delayed yesterday due to heavy fog on the Zhejiang sea, and only arrived in Shanghai this morning. The Rice Merchants Association handled the registration of rice distribution to rice shops in the French Concession yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Ships Delayed Until Today</p>
<p>More than 20,000 bags of the fifth batch of foreign rice commissioned by the China Rice Industry Company to Dreyfus were transported by the Taikoo Company's Chengdu. It was originally scheduled to arrive at port at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, but according to the company's news, the ship was slightly delayed due to adverse coastal weather and will be delayed until 10:00 AM this morning. As for Yongda Grain Company, which ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, the second batch of 26,000 bags, loaded on the Margerethe Siemers, will also arrive this afternoon. The company plans to start unloading immediately and handle the rice distribution procedures as before.</p>
<p>Arrangements for Three Batches Shipped Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The third batch of 29,000 bags of foreign rice from Yongda Grain Company has been loaded on the Athenian and shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday, the shipowner telegraphed that it would arrive in Shanghai on the 14th. Gu Xinyi, the manager of the company, has agreed with the American firm Whelly &amp; Wiley to berth at the Jinliyuan Wharf. As for the distribution method, it has been agreed with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement to allocate 9,000 bags to 300 rice shops in the Public Settlement for retail, 30 bags per shop, at a price of 16.45 yuan per bag in national currency.</p>
<p>Previously Distributed Foreign Rice Sold Out</p>
<p>The 500 registered rice shops in the Public Settlement and the French Concession have been retailing the fourth batch of distributed rice, 40 bags each, jointly purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement and the China Rice Industry Company. They have generally been sold out in recent days and are eager to receive the fifth batch of distributed rice to continue retailing. Some rice shops are also selling flour to make adjustments, as Shanghai's flour mills are still shipping out a lot, enough to meet demand. Although more and more citizens are changing from eating rice to eating flour because rice is difficult to buy, the factories are still providing a steady supply.</p>
<p>Continue to Allocate Food Rice to Refugees</p>
<p>The food for refugees in the French Concession's various shelters has been continuously supplied since the French Municipal Council allocated 3,200 bags of foreign rice transported to Shanghai by the China Rice Industry Company, which were distributed in four batches by the International Relief Committee. Each shelter has benefited greatly. Furthermore, the French Municipal Council, in order to continue adjusting the refugees' food supply, notified the International Relief Committee yesterday to continue allocating 800 bags of foreign rice to be used as food for refugee shelters in the French Concession. The committee will notify each shelter to collect the rice next Monday and Tuesday, following the previous method.</p>
<p>Association Handled Rice Distribution Yesterday</p>
<p>It has been decided that 8,000 bags of the two batches of foreign rice from the grain merchants will be distributed to 200 rice shops in the French Concession for retail. Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday, the Rice Merchants Association dispatched staff members such as Shen Zaizhi to handle the payment and collection of rice by rice shops in the French Concession at Yongda Grain Company on Tianzhutang Street. After the goods arrive in Shanghai, the association will distribute them according to the numbers. As for the registration of the fifth batch of distributed rice from Dreyfus, it has been completed. After the goods arrive in Shanghai, they will be distributed immediately, 40 bags per shop, totaling 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Prices Rise in Grain Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from the grain merchants that the foreign rice ordered by Dreyfus and Yongda Rice Company will be retailed to member rice shops of the Rice Merchants Association. The price for delivery at the码头 is 16.15 yuan per bag, with an additional 0.3 yuan per bag for delivery at the warehouse, and an additional 0.25 yuan per bag for transportation and handling fees. The retail price for each rice shop is 8.5分 per 市斤, which is 16.85 yuan per bag of 198 市斤. However, due to the lack of spot goods in the market, the price of whole bags has risen to 19.8 yuan. The cost of ordering foreign rice, including transportation, is about 13 yuan per bag. If the import tax of 4.15 yuan per bag is added, it will be 17.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Italian Soldier Firing Live Rounds Injures Artisan; Military Police Interrogate</h3>
<p>No Target Practice Facilities There; Police Station Interrogated and Transferred</p>
<p>Yesterday's report stated that on the afternoon of the 10th, an Italian soldier stationed near Xiaoshadu Road and Macao Road was practicing shooting, and injured Xu Quanxue, a mud artisan building a stove at the Fourth Refugee Shelter of the International Rescue Association. It has been learned that the Italian army stationed in the area has been firing guns in the vicinity for several days. On the 10th, an Italian soldier fired again behind the shelter. The guns were all firing live rounds at a level trajectory, concentrating on the bamboo fence at the back. During the shooting in the morning, a bullet entered the auditorium, but fortunately no incident occurred. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, an Italian soldier fired a live round again, causing this disaster. The shelter recovered the bullet head. The Italian soldier who fired the shot was stopped by residents outside the garden, taken away by the police, and handed over to the Italian military authorities. It was determined that there were no target practice facilities in the area. The Italian soldiers firing live rounds at a level trajectory is truly inexplicable. Xu Quanxue, also known as Quanxi, has been sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but as of the morning of the 11th, he has not yet emerged from danger. In addition to reporting the details to the headquarters for review, the shelter has specifically requested the headquarters to intervene on the matter of refugee safety to prevent the same situation from occurring.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, an Italian soldier suddenly fired a gun yesterday (the 10th), hitting a mud artisan named Xu in the refugee shelter on Feilun Road near Macao Road. After being sent to Renji Hospital, his injuries were very serious last night. After being interrogated by the Shanghai Municipal Council police station yesterday afternoon, the Italian soldier has been handed over to the Italian military authorities for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Street Children Enrolled in School</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Street Children's Education Association is actively promoting its efforts to support homeless and out-of-school children by providing them with appropriate education, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Xiong Xiling convened the third meeting. First, Dong Renjian, the general director, reported that more than ten street children's education classes have been established, with over a thousand children enrolled, and teaching has already begun. Chen Heqin then reported on the donations received from the China Child Welfare Association Relief Committee and other organizations. The board of directors' articles of association were then approved, and Xiong Xiling was elected as chairman, Zhao Jinqing and Liu Hongen as vice-chairmen, Chen Heqin as secretary, and Wang Guoxiu as accountant. Several important cases were also discussed, with the hope of soon eliminating out-of-school street children in the settlements.</p>
<h3>Perpetrator of Grenade Attack on Nanjing Road Examined</h3>
<p>Nationality Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Regarding the incident on the 3rd of this month when Japanese soldiers were parading on Nanjing Road in the Public Settlement, and an unknown man of unknown nationality suddenly threw a hand grenade, resulting in the man being arrested and shot dead, it has been learned that the man's body was requested by the police station to be examined by the Special First Court Prosecutor's Office, but the request was withdrawn. Then, on the 8th, the police station continued to request an examination. Prosecutor Song Genshan and forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan of the court accepted the examination as usual. The result confirmed that the man died from gunshot wounds and ordered his burial. The man's nationality is being investigated by the Shanghai Municipal Council police station.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>Merchants Exert Themselves to Supply; Insufficient US Dollar Reserves</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in this city, people's faith in currency has inevitably been shaken by external pressure. Those with surplus funds are seeking safe havens, and precious metals and foreign gold coins have become their targets, with people scrambling to collect them. Coupled with various difficulties in seeking supplies and smelting,赤金 once soared to 1,500 yuan per bar (10 taels). Recently, due to merchants making efforts to supply them, it has greatly stabilized. According to recent market prices, 烚赤 has fallen back to around 1,300 yuan per bar. The current标金 is about 1,280 yuan. Datongheng 銀樓 sells饰金 for 130 yuan per tael and buys it back for 124 yuan. As for foreign gold coins, the selling price at various small money changers is 32 yuan for British pounds spot and 33 yuan for US dollars spot. US dollars futures are 31.5 yuan. However, general reserves are not very sufficient, and current US dollars are most needed.</p>
<h3>Seven Chinese Cotton Mills in West Shanghai Resume Night Shifts</h3>
<p>Sales Decrease Greatly; Over 40,000 Workers Unemployed; 20-Count High-Grade Yarn is 290 Yuan; Workers Crowd in and Out Along the Bund</p>
<p>There are a total of 28 Chinese cotton mills in Shanghai, with 1,157,200 spindles, 7,864 looms, and approximately 65,146 workers. They were forced to completely shut down after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. Now that seven factories, including Shenxin in West Shanghai, have resumed work, they have also resumed night shifts. However, yarn sales have decreased greatly, and there is no market for futures yarn. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumed Night Shifts</p>
<p>The Chinese cotton mills in the West Shanghai area have resumed night shifts after resuming operations. There are a total of seven factories: ㊀ Shenxin No. 2 Factory has 40,300 yarn spindles and 5,040 thread spindles. ㊁ Shenxin No. 9 Factory has 72,156 yarn spindles, 10,860 thread spindles, and 900 looms. ㊂ Xinyu No. 1 Factory has 25,600 yarn spindles and 1,200 thread spindles. ㊃ Xinyu No. 2 Factory has 24,920 yarn spindles and 504 looms. ㊄ Tongyi has 65,852 yarn spindles and 7,228 thread spindles. ㊅ Yongan No. 3 Factory has 62,816 yarn spindles. ㊆ Hongzhang has 20,568 yarn spindles and 3,200 thread spindles.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Decrease Greatly</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton and Cloth Exchange has stopped trading in various types of futures yarn since the outbreak of the war, so there is no market price for futures yarn. Due to transportation obstructions, even shipping spot yarn is difficult, and transactions have decreased greatly. Currently, the places where yarn is being sold are ports accessible by waterway, such as Fuzhou, Shantou, Guangzhou, Tongzhou, Wentai, Ningbo, etc. Japanese yarn has taken over the sales of yarn in North China. As for prices, 20-count high-grade yarn is 290 yuan per bale, and secondary-grade yarn is 285 yuan per bale, which is almost the same as before August 13th.</p>
<p>Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>The 28 Chinese cotton mills directly employ over 65,000 workers. The seven factories that are now open directly employ over 25,000 workers. Therefore, over 40,000 workers in Chinese cotton mills are unemployed, most of whom are female workers. However, most of these female workers have returned to their hometowns. The Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Association has registered approximately 1,500 unemployed cotton mill workers, including workers from Japanese cotton mills.</p>
<p>Pudong and East Shanghai</p>
<p>After the war shifted westward, some of the foreign-owned factories and warehouses in Pudong and Yangshupu in East Shanghai have resumed operations. However, the workers are scattered in the settlements, and transportation is obstructed. Therefore, the factories and warehouses have dispatched輪駁 boats to pick up and drop off workers at the new wharf outside the Sanma Road Bund every morning and evening. According to investigations, in Pudong, there are over 300 workers at the Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, over 200 workers at the Blue Funnel Wharf, over 200 workers at the Hefeng Iron Factory, over 300 workers at the Jiangmao Warehouse Wharf and cotton-picking sheds, over 100 workers at the Asiatic Petroleum Depot, and over 200 workers at the Standard Oil Depot. In East Shanghai, there are over 300 workers at the Ewo Cotton Mill, over 200 workers at the Ruirong Iron Factory, and 400 workers at the Electric Light Factory, totaling approximately 2,500 male and female workers, who gather at the wharf twice a day, morning and evening, between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM and between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM, which is extremely crowded. In addition, over 4,000 male and female workers from the Yizhong Tobacco Factory in Pudong are also crowded on the floating wharf set up in the Bund Park. Therefore, the Bund area outside the Public Settlement has become a place where workers gather to go to and from work.</p>
<h3>British and American Warships Come and Go</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, Vice Admiral Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, is scheduled to depart south today (the 11th). Vice Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, is scheduled to depart next Tuesday for Manila. Vice Admiral Little left the British naval pontoon in the Huangpu River on the HMS Falmouth at approximately 7:30 AM this morning. Therefore, the only British warship remaining in the Huangpu River is the HMS Folkestone cruiser. Although the destination of the vice admiral has not been officially announced, it is said that he will go to Hong Kong and is expected to return to Shanghai before April next year. Vice Admiral Yarnell is going to Manila on the USS Augusta for a winter cruise. His return date to Shanghai is uncertain. It is said that unless there is a major event, the USS Augusta will not return to Shanghai before it returns to the northern seas next spring.</p>
<p>The American light cruiser USS Marblehead arrived in Shanghai after 4:00 PM yesterday, after having been away from Shanghai for ten years. The ship came to the Far East with the Sixth Regiment of the US Marine Corps after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and then went north to Qingdao. The ship carries approximately 450 officers and sailors. After the USS Augusta leaves Shanghai, this ship will be the flagship of the US fleet.</p>
<h3>National Trade Bureau Moves to Hankou</h3>
<p>Zhu Xinong Transferred to Chief of General Affairs</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's National Trade Bureau has now moved to Hankou to work. Wang Shinai, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the bureau, has resigned due to personal reasons. His position has been transferred to Zhu Xinong, the chief of the Statistics Department.

<h3>Female Nurse Without Driving Skills Kills Hawker in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Family Files Incidental Civil Suit</p>
<p>Mao Juqing, a 21-year-old female nurse from Ningbo at the Kemei Obstetric Hospital at 446 Avenue Joffre, accompanied a obstetrician on a Red Cross-marked car owned by the hospital to pick up a woman for delivery the morning before yesterday. After the job was completed, they still took the original car back to the hospital. At 9:00 AM, the car was passing in front of the small vegetable market at the west end of the Eight Immortals Bridge. Mao ordered the driver Wu Maonv to stop and told Wu to go into the vegetable market to buy fresh crabs. Wu then parked the car at the west end of Rue Cardinal Fesch near Route Mayers. Unexpectedly, when the driver got out of the car, Ms. Mao took the liberty of reversing the car. Because she did not know how to drive, the car moved backward, and the rear of the car turned sharply and drove into the vegetable market, knocking down Xu Ziqiao, a 71-year-old local hawker selling oil tofu. Xu was injured, fell unconscious, and was later taken to Guangci Hospital by the patrolmen. The treatment did not work and he died at noon that day. The police reported the body to the court for dispatch of personnel for examination and verification, and the body was claimed by the family. On the one hand, the police said that the driver should have turned off the engine when parking, and should not have neglected it, which resulted in a major disaster. Therefore, Mao and Wu were both sent to the Special Second Court for questioning. After the judge opened the court for interrogation, the court approved the police's request for postponement of investigation. After briefly questioning the two defendants, they were returned to detention to await the re-examination after the investigation is clarified. On the side of the body's family, they initially did not want to make trouble, and only asked the Kemei Hospital for the cost of funeral expenses. However, because the hospital refused, the family has now hired a lawyer to submit a statement to the court, requesting to file an incidental civil suit against the defendants and the car owner to recover losses.</p>
<h3>Two More Accomplices in French Concession Robbery Arrested</h3>
<p>The notorious robber Min Xinhao, a man from Pudong who is nearly thirty years old, used to be an elementary school teacher. After participating in a kidnapping case and being arrested, he was released due to lack of evidence. He still engaged in the life of a bandit. He was sentenced to prison by the Special Courts of the British and French settlements. Later, due to the outbreak of this war, he was pardoned before the end of his sentence. On the 1st of this month, he joined forces with his accomplices Zhou Genlai and Xiao Xu, who are at large, and took weapons to rob Zhang Yuan's home at No. 5 Weixing Lane, 22 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, but failed and fled. The victim's family chased after them and shouted for their arrest. Min fled to the Malan Road area, where he was captured by the detectives and a box cannon was found on him. Xiao Xu fled from Rue du Père Robert into Liyuanfang and exited Kantai Road, past the entrance of the Rongjin Grand Theater, and fled into the back door of the Hexing Inn on Avenue Paul Beauvais, directly onto the晒台, intending to escape by climbing over the roof. Because the detectives chased in, he opened fire to resist arrest and was shot dead by the detectives. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, detectives Wang Rusong, etc. of the French Police Station, based on the confessions of the Min robber, arrested Wang Zengfa and Yin Hesheng, two men from Shaoxing, at No. 32 Zhizhong Lane on Zilaihuo Street and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to Criminal Court One of the Special Second Court. Chen, the lawyer of the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the case still needs detailed investigation and requested another postponement. During the court hearing, Min Xinhao confessed that the robbery was initiated by Xia Asan, who is at large, and all the box cannons were borrowed from Wang Zengde's home with Xia. He said that Xia was a disciple of Wang. Wang Zengde confessed that Min had been to my house several times, but I did not lend him the box cannons. The rest of his words were ambiguous. Yin denied participating in the robbery. The court approved the postponement to the 17th and remanded the defendants.</p>
<h3>Mastermind of Tung Oil Theft Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Ma Shangshu, a Tongzhou man who used to serve in the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station of the Public Settlement, led a group of vagrants last month, using various methods, to steal and sell tung oil worth more than one million yuan from tung oil ships berthed at the Yangshupu Electric Light Wharf. Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Public Police Station, etc., successively arrested about 20 thieves and receivers and recovered part of the stolen goods, but the mastermind Ma Shangshu was at large. At 9:40 AM the morning before yesterday, Chinese detectives Wang Chengying, Feng Zhiming, Zhu Shuling, etc. of the department arrested Gu Tianhua, a Chongming native, a thief in the case, at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Shandong Road. They then learned that Ma was now hiding at No. 383 Da Xi Road, so they secretly went to arrest him at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. At that time, Ma (originally living at No. 7 Lane 510 Rue Amiral Courbet in the French Concession) was sitting around the stove with Zhu Miaogen, a former detective from the river patrol station in Pudong. They were arrested together and sent to Criminal Court One of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Zhu Miaogen retained lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. First, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu applied to temporarily detain the defendants in this case and combine them with Zhang Qingshan, etc., who had been apprehended for interrogation. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, he approved the detention and combined the cases for interrogation.</p>
<h3>British and Japanese Negotiating Customs Revenue Issue</h3>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, regarding the customs revenue issue in this city, it is rumored from well-informed sources that the British foreign affairs authorities in Shanghai are negotiating with the Japanese side. No one can predict the outcome, and the United States and France are closely watching the situation due to their common interests. It is difficult to have results in the short term. It is said that there is no fixed tax standard or object for goods shipped in from foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Local Goods Dealers Jointly Charter Boats to Tongzhou to Procure Vegetables</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Vegetables, Beans, Chickens, and Ducks Will Be Shipped to Shanghai in the Coming Days</p>
<p>After the Local Goods Industry Association has made great efforts to dredge up sources, local goods dealers have flocked to purchase and transport vegetables from Nantong Tianshenggang and Pudong areas directly to Shanghai to regulate food supplies. The supply sources are more abundant and the selling prices are becoming more stable. Now, Yuji Xing, Yongshun, Hongda, Yongyu, Jiang Yuanshun, Zhengtai Yiji, Qu Futai, Longshun, and other eight local goods dealers, in order to meet market needs, jointly chartered the American company Moller Company's Miller wheel on the 7th to Tianshenggang to procure vegetables and beans. According to reporters from Xin Xin News Agency who inquired from the dealers, large quantities of vegetables and beans and large quantities of chickens, ducks, eggs, and sheep will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days, and procurement will continue in order to regulate supply.</p>
<h3>News of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Staff Being Paid Severance is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was disbanding its staff and issuing severance pay for two months, funded by the bureau itself. According to accurate information, the subsidiary organizations of this Municipal Government are disbanding their employees in accordance with the telegram from the Executive Yuan, issuing the November salary and then disbanding them, without issuing severance pay. It is also said that the Social Affairs Bureau is in arrears of large amounts of funds from the municipal treasury, resulting in its subsidiary organizations and schools being unable to pay the remaining temporary expenses, etc., in addition to paying the regular expenses. They must wait for the financial authorities to sort out the arrears before they can be paid. Therefore, there are definitely no remaining funds to pay staff severance pay.</p>
<h3>Suspected Theft by Dismissed Colleague</h3>
<p>Detained for Investigation and Interrogation</p>
<p>Tang Zhuping, a Cantonese man, was employed as a clerk at the Shanghai Insurance Company at No. 299 Sichuan Road. He was dismissed by the company on the 30th of last month. However, on the 8th of this month, the company discovered that many blank insurance policies had been stolen, and fearing that they would be circulated and cause trouble, they reported it to the General Inspectorate. Under the investigation of Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei, it was discovered that Qian Yihua Luggage Company on Beijing Road had Tang handling the insurance of 35,000 yuan of goods, with an insurance premium of 187.50 yuan. However, the insurance policy was not directly issued by the company and was one of the stolen policies. Therefore, Tang was suspected and was arrested yesterday at No. 6 Baoan Lane, Tianjin Road. Ten blank insurance policies were found. This morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested a postponement for a detailed investigation. After questioning by Judge Huang, the request for a one-week postponement was granted.</p>
<h3>Measles Still Not Eradicated</h3>
<p>Cholera Completely Eliminated in Shanghai; Hong Kong Cancels Quarantine Restrictions</p>
<p>Recently, the number of measles cases in this city is still high. However, the health authorities are working hard to prevent and control it, such as collecting blood and injecting serum. Few cases of infectious diseases such as diphtheria and smallpox have been found. Cholera has been completely eradicated. According to reports, cholera is also not prevalent in Hong Kong. Therefore, ships traveling from Shanghai and Hong Kong to various ports outside the city are no longer subject to quarantine restrictions.</p>
<h3>European Mail Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Postal Administration, European mail arrived in Shanghai again today. In addition to the mail sealed and sent from Europe on the Victoria, there was also mail sealed and sent from Marseille on the Asama Maru, both of which are expected to arrive in the morning.
