<h3>冷落的杭州</h3>
<p>— 彭</p>
<p>在平時，上海和杭州的交通，是極端敏捷，早上從上海動身，中午便可以一品西泠之茗，午後遨遊湖士半日，薄暮驅車城站，那穩而且快的滬杭車，不到晚上十一點鐘，便把你很安全地載到上海。</p>
<p>就是寫信，說不定早上發出去的快信，到午夜已收到回音。長途電話不用說，更是瞬息傳音，亳無隔膜。還有一條滬杭公路，愛駕汽車的朋友們，不斷的在大道上疾馳着，筆者的朋友施君，曾以高速度的駕駛，化了兩個半鐘頭，竟從裏西湖奔馳到上海的靜安寺路。</p>
<p>可是現在呢？杭州的消息，完全隔絕。關心湖上的人們，僅憑着片段的傳聞，不是說杭州極度紛亂，就是說西湖上已經寂寞得像一個死城。</p>
<p>在昨天的薄暮，忽然來到一位杭州友人，從他的口中，得到些杭州最近的情况。</p>
<p>他是從杭州到寗波乘輪船到上海的，很安全地經過了吳淞口，踏上了反而比較安全的上海租界。他說：“杭州現在確實是一個死城！差不多有三分之二的人都避到鄉下去，自從嘉興失守以後，杭州人眞的恐惶，重要的機關，都已搬到金華去，就連言論犀利的東南日報，也遷到金華出版。馬路上冷清清的，找不到一輛汽車，就是黃包車也躲藏起來。現在杭州所有的住戶，都是窮苦的人，雖然也知道性命要緊，非暫時走避，不足以謀安全，但是為金錢所困，却也無法走開，只好聽命運之支配而已！</p>
<p>“在淞滬戰事發動以後，杭州的富戶，認為莫干山是安全的去處，挈婦携離，絡繹登山，竹林深處，儼然有世外桃源。可是最近湖州喫緊，山中人又紛紛向杭州跑，最苦的是此路軍運頻繁，無汽車可坐，只得從三橋埠取水道到杭州，濡緩而躭心，眞有相當的狼狽。</p>
<p>一從形勢上看來，杭州在目前還不致於十分危險，然而杭州人所感受的恐惶，已經似乎大軍壓境，這眞是莫明其妙。而湖上的遊人，已告絕跡，晚上淸冷的電燈，隨着勁勵的秋風搖幌，格外顯出蕭森凄慘的景象來。</p>
<p>和杭州同為天堂的蘇州，已逢着悲慘的命運，我不忍再想像杭州未來的遭遇了！</p>

<h3>Widespread Rumors from New York Regarding a Secret Sino-Soviet Pact</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Acknowledges Chinese Sovereignty over Outer Mongolia; Vladivostok is in a State of Wartime Alert, Hastily Constructing Defensive Works</p>
<p>[New York] Mr. Colby, a New York importer, arrived in San Francisco this morning aboard the "China Clipper" from Hong Kong. He stated to reporters that while in China, he received information from the most reliable sources that China had concluded a secret agreement with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union could indirectly aid China's military activities. The agreement reportedly stipulates that the Soviet Union recognizes the Chinese government's sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. Currently, a large number of Soviet troops and aircraft are concentrated there. Mr. Colby also said that the agreement also allows Outer Mongolia to assist China in its war of resistance against Japan, without hindering Soviet-Japanese relations. It is said that if the Outer Mongolian military authorities join the Sino-Japanese war, the prospects for the Sino-Japanese war will inevitably be prolonged and expanded, and it will definitely not end before next spring. The Chinese government has now signed a contract with the Soviet Union to purchase a large quantity of gasoline to supply Outer Mongolian aircraft. (National News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>▲ According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, intelligence from Moscow and Paris states that the entire city of Vladivostok has been built into a large trench. The city is now in a state of war alert. Entering the city requires strict inspection not only for foreigners but also for our own citizens. Day and night, guards are stationed and patrol the entire city. There are more people in military uniform than in plain clothes. The surrounding area is busy constructing underground defensive works, with outstanding workers rotating in three shifts, working day and night. The underground facilities are long-range gun mounts and power plants made of steel. There are bomb shelters everywhere in the city and in the port, the largest of which is an underground hangar capable of accommodating 150 aircraft. Several military roads are also under construction. It is estimated that the city's military strength, including the navy, is now 85,000, and is still increasing.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Refuses to Sign the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement</h3>
<p>Suggests Reopening Negotiations</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the "Asahi Shimbun," Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov recently stated during a conversation with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru that the Soviet government cannot agree to formally sign the revised Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement, which was initialed last October, due to the overall situation. He suggested renegotiating and revising the agreement in light of the current situation, and stated that the Soviet government is currently drafting proposals and will submit them soon. Japanese trading companies involved in Soviet fisheries are dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's attitude and are holding meetings to discuss the steps to be taken to deal with the new situation. It is understood that the two fisheries agreements were based on the Treaty of Portsmouth and expired last year. After lengthy negotiations, a new agreement was reached. The Soviet government then refused to sign the new fisheries agreement because Japan had concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, and only agreed to extend the old agreement for twelve months. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union is unwilling to indefinitely extend Japan's fishing rights because Japan, Germany, and Italy have now formed the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Strictly Prevents Espionage Activities</h3>
<p>Kalinin's Election Speech</p>
<p>[Moscow] Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, recently participated in a rally for the election of the Council of the Union in Leningrad (according to the new constitution, the parliament adopts a bicameral system, one is the Council of the Union, and the other is the Council of Nationalities), and delivered a speech, saying that espionage and sabotage by enemies must be severely guarded against. "Leningrad is both our country's window to Europe and a gateway for a large number of enemies to infiltrate the country. These enemies are colluding with the international bourgeoisie, the most aggressive, namely the fascist reactionaries. We must strengthen our military preparations so that we will not be caught off guard in times of crisis." He concluded by saying, "The enthusiasm of the national working masses in supporting the Communist Party and the Soviet system can be seen in this election." (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Koreans in the Maritime Province Forced to Leave</h3>
<p>Japanese Protest to Russia Rejected</p>
<p>[Moscow] Many Koreans who had become naturalized Soviet citizens originally lived in the Maritime Provinces of eastern Siberia. The Soviet Russian government recently ordered them to move inland. Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru therefore lodged a protest with the Soviet Russian government, which was rejected, saying that these Koreans are Soviet citizens and the Japanese Embassy has no right to interfere. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Konoe's Remarks</h3>
<p>An Interpretation by the Eastern Newspaper</p>
<p>[Tokyo] "The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun English Edition" reported that in Prime Minister Konoe's talk with people in the press last Friday, there were remarks such as Japan may have to resort to force, and everything depends on the attitude of the authorities of the Public Concession. Translators now regard this as a great loss of the true meaning of the Prime Minister's talk. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" today published an editorial commenting on this matter, saying that the Prime Minister's talk was extremely frank and clear, with very little ambiguity. This move is of great significance in making the world understand Japan's attitude. When the Prime Minister briefly outlined the possible developments of Japan's actions in China, he said that if the authorities of the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession do not fulfill the Japanese authorities' request to suppress anti-Japanese activities, they may be forced to take action. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Publicizes its Military Objectives to Italy</h3>
<p>[Rome] Baron Okura, a Japanese goodwill envoy, recently gave a speech at the Italian Institute for the Near and Far East, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the Japanese people for Italy's sympathy towards Japan. He said that the main reasons for the current dispute between China and Japan are two: one is China's anti-Japanese propaganda, and the other is the continued growth of communist forces within China. "Japan is determined to do its utmost to fight against communism." In 1936, Japan invited China to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Chinese government not only refused to ratify it, but also established a non-aggression pact with Soviet Russia. Currently, the goals that Japan seeks in China are: ㊀ joint anti-communism, ㊁ mutual cooperation in economy, and ㊂ maintaining peace in the Far East. In terms of economic cooperation, Japan feels a lack of natural resources and seeks raw materials from China and opens up sales channels for domestic goods, which is a matter of course. After the speech, Italian Senator and Dean of the Institute for the Near and Far East, Scialoja, gave a reply, and then many musicians performed ancient and modern Japanese music to entertain the guests.

<h3>Japan Covets Our Customs; The United States and France Follow Britain in Submitting Representations to Japan</h3>
<p>Please Respect Foreign Interests in China; The Two Countries Consult to Take Joint Action</p>
<p>[London] According to sources here, Britain has an investment of 180 million pounds in China, so it has decided to ask Japan to respect foreign interests regarding Japan's coveting of the Shanghai Chinese Customs. The British ambassador to Japan has been ordered to negotiate with the Japanese government. The financial community here is also putting pressure on Chamberlain to take concrete action. It is reported that Britain, the United States, and France are now united in their position on this matter, and believe that unless a tough stance is taken, the Japanese will completely seize everything in Shanghai. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] US Secretary of State Hull recently ordered Ambassador to Japan Grew to inform the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the US government is very concerned about the future of the Chinese customs system and hopes that Japan will not make any changes to the Chinese customs work situation and tax revenue distribution. It is understood that the United States made this representation at the same time as other related countries. Since Japan expressed its intention to take over the Chinese customs, the governments of Britain and the United States have been conducting formal talks. British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay visited State Department Assistant Wilson yesterday, and the discussion was related to this matter. The US authorities have not yet considered taking joint action with Britain, but if the representation made by Ambassador Grew does not receive a satisfactory answer, then it will be considered separately. (Havas dispatch, 27th) Hull also stated that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will be responsible for dealing with all incidents in the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession caused by Japanese interference. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>[Paris] It is reported that the French ambassador to Japan has been instructed to notify the Japanese government that any measures regarding Chinese customs must first be discussed with the French government. This request is the same as the one that Britain has made to Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the Chinese customs system, the British government recently made representations to Japan. At the same time, a British newspaper reported, "The Shanghai Public Concession is one of the most honorable jewels in the crown of the British Empire." This report has aroused enthusiastic reactions in the Italian press. Among them, an article by the famous reporter Gaida in the "Italian People's Voice" strongly opposed the British monopoly of the Shanghai concession, saying that Britain's rights in the Shanghai Public Concession are only equal to those of other related countries. If Britain makes a separate claim on the Shanghai issue, it is close to solely estimating the Public Concession and cannot be tolerated. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Embassy Staff Arrive in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Hankou] British Chargé d'Affaires Ho Wu, accompanied by many staff members from the British Embassy, arrived in Hankou yesterday afternoon aboard the British gunboat Bee. US Ambassador Johnson and most of the US Embassy staff also arrived at the same time aboard the US gunboat Luzon. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now temporarily located in the third special district, namely the administrative office of the former British Concession. Minister Wang is currently in Changsha and plans to stay for a few days before coming to Hankou. It is rumored that if Hankou is attacked in the future, the Ministry will move to Sichuan Province, probably to work in Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Flood in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Our Country Remits Money for Relief</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chinese government yesterday remitted 500,000 francs to the Governor of Vietnam in French Indochina as a donation for flood relief, and the Governor of Vietnam sent a telegram to General Chiang Kai-shek to express his gratitude. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Trade Unions Join International Trade Union</h3>
<p>Jointly Resist Fascism; A Great Achievement for the World's Labor Movement</p>
<p>[Moscow] A delegation led by the Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, Jouhaux, recently came here from Paris to hold negotiations with the authorities of the Soviet Trade Unions to join the International Federation of Trade Unions affiliated with the Second International. After five days of negotiations, an agreement was signed stipulating various conditions for the establishment of a single organization for the Soviet Trade Unions and the International Federation of Trade Unions. The main point is to jointly resist fascism, but the details are kept strictly confidential to avoid premature disclosure, which would lead to misfortune. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the Soviet Trade Unions joining the International Federation of Trade Unions affiliated with the Second International, it is generally believed that this is a great achievement for the world's labor movement. Except for those belonging to fascist countries, most of the world's large-scale labor organizations have joined the International Federation of Trade Unions. Only the Soviet Trade Unions, with approximately 20 million members, are still outside the organization. Now, after Jouhaux's negotiations, it has been decided to join again. In addition, the Mexican General Confederation of Labor, with a total of 4 million members, joined the International Federation of Trade Unions last year. The General Federation of Labor of the Irish Free State has applied to join, but has not paid its membership fees, and the International Federation of Trade Unions has not yet officially recognized it. Other general trade unions such as the Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand have not joined, but their relationship with the International Federation of Trade Unions is still very good, and they will likely join one after another in the future. Regarding the international labor movement, someone recently asked the Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, Jouhaux, whether the working classes of the world can take consistent action in politics. He replied that this is not something he could answer, and that this trip was limited to trade union organizational issues. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Changxing Front is Breached, Fierce Battle Occurs in Sian Town</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Attempt to Invade Guangde in Southern Anhui; Guerrilla Warfare Continues to Unfold on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line; Artillery Battle Near Jiangyin is Extremely Fierce</p>
<p>Due to telegraph obstructions, there is very little detailed news about the battles on both the north and south banks of Taihu Lake and on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines. According to Western sources, Wuxi and Changxing have fallen. The following is a summary of the war news obtained by this newspaper: ㊀ Although the county seat of Wuxi was breached by the Japanese army, our army moved west, but fierce battles are still continuing in the vicinity of the suburbs. After the Japanese army advanced to Wuxi, they divided their troops along the Xicheng Highway to attack our Jiangyin Fortress. Fierce battles have taken place between the railway line and the Yangtze River coast. Our army in the fortress is firmly defending and is still engaged in a fierce artillery battle with Japanese warships in the river. The Japanese army avoids the important and takes the light. The Japanese warships to the east of Jiangyin are moving with the intention of taking Jiangyin first with all their strength. The artillery battle near Jiangyin is also extremely fierce. The Japanese army, attempting to advance directly along the railway line to attack Wujin, is still encountering fierce resistance from our army in the suburbs of Wuxi. ㊁ The Japanese army in Wuxing, on the south bank of Taihu Lake, continues to advance along the highway. Changxing has also been breached. After the Japanese army occupied Changxing, they divided their troops to invade Guangde in southern Anhui, attempting to threaten Wuhu to the north and make Nanjing vulnerable from both the front and rear. A fierce battle has taken place in Sian Town between Changxing and Guangde. Our army has built strong defensive works in the mountainous terrain near Guangde. The Japanese army will inevitably encounter more fierce resistance in their advance. At the same time, the Japanese army in Changxing is also attacking Yixing to the north, attempting to coordinate with the Japanese army advancing along the railway line. Therefore, a tense situation has appeared in Yixing. ㊂ On the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, the front and left and right wings have not changed because they are not the main forces of both sides. The guerrilla warfare of our army near Suzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway is still continuing to unfold.</p>
<p>Changxing Road is a key point leading directly to Guangde, and a fierce battle has now begun. According to foreign sources, the county seat is still in the hands of our army, but the front has been breached at one point, and fierce battles have been raging for days. Under the cover of fierce artillery fire, the Japanese army is still advancing westward, attempting to cross into Guangde in Anhui, turn to Wuhu, and attack Nanjing from both sides. However, we have laid heavy troops layer by layer and will defend with all our strength to prevent the Japanese army from penetrating further. For days, large groups of Japanese aircraft have been flying to bomb the highway between Changxing and Guangde. Also, a certain guild in this city received a telegram from Hangzhou, saying that the battle on the Huchang Highway has shifted westward from Lijia Lane and Santianmen to the vicinity of Qingshan in Zhonghengtang. There is a mountainous natural barrier there, about ten kilometers from Changxing County.</p>
<p>According to various intelligence sources, the Japanese side has concentrated its sea, land, and air forces and launched a full-scale attack on our Jiangyin Fortress for days. Fierce battles are still taking place at Maozhugang and Duanshan at the western end of Changyinsha. Our army there has strong forces and very solid fortifications. The troops stationed there are determined to coexist with the city and are desperately defending, so after many days of fierce fighting, the position remains unmoved. The Japanese army has changed its strategy and is fiercely bombarding Jiangyin on the opposite bank, with the intention of landing on the north bank. It is reported that we have long built fortifications along the river and have capable troops preparing to fight to the death, which can ensure safety. The first line of defense has also been strengthened, and it will not be easy for the Japanese army to destroy it. Although there are rumors that Wuxi has fallen, our army has close contact between Jiangyin and Changzhou, which is enough to block its conspiracy to encircle us.</p>
<p>The night before last, more than 400 Japanese wounded soldiers were found at the intersection of Xujiahui and the French Concession. It is also rumored that many Japanese wounded soldiers have been transported from there to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is reported that the Chinese army in Wuxi City has abandoned Wuxi and retreated to Changzhou because all the defensive works have been destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, but there were still battles in the four suburbs outside Wuxi City last night. (Express dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to Chinese sources, fierce battles are still taking place in Changxing on the south bank of Taihu Lake. The rumor that the Chinese army has abandoned Changxing has not yet been confirmed, but the situation there is indeed very critical. The battle in Wuxi has shifted to a certain place 15 kilometers east of Changzhou, and the battle is still raging. (Express dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Nantong] The Japanese warships on the Langshan River surface sailed to Shanghai on the 27th and invaded Chengxi. More than 30 ships are still anchored and still firing south. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Nantong] The Japanese warships on the Langfu crossing river surface are heading west to invade Chengxi. 41 ships were anchored on the 26th and there was no movement. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Tang Shengzhi Declares to Foreigners That the Capital Will Inevitably Become a Battlefield</h3>
<p>The Capital is Currently Guarded by Well-Organized Troops; Once the Situation Turns Critical, All City Gates Will Be Closed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] General Tang Shengzhi, Commander of the Capital Garrison, declared last night when he met with a group of foreigners representing the consulates, churches, newspapers, and large trading companies of various countries that the capital may become a battlefield in the near future. Tang also stated the will of the highest military authorities to defend the capital to the death. Tang said, "We Chinese must sacrifice. There are now two things that can be decided: one is that I, as a Chinese soldier, intend to sacrifice myself for the country, and the other is that our sacrifice will cause the enemy to lose a great deal." Tang advised foreigners who can leave the capital to do so, but the Chinese government will do its best to guarantee the safety of foreigners staying in the capital. Tang continued, "After a long war, chaos is inevitable. Even a drunkard will do things that he would not do when he is sober, so what is so strange about an army under heavy bombardment and in hardship sometimes committing outrages? The capital is currently guarded by well-organized troops, and other troops are gradually retreating. It is difficult to expect them to strictly observe discipline. If foreigners have any dissatisfaction, we will do our best to correct it after we hear about it. As the person in charge, I intend to do everything in my power to curb chaos. In a few days, the situation will not become serious suddenly, but once the situation turns critical, all city gates will be closed, and other actions will be taken, but no matter what, I will do my best to protect foreigners." After Tang finished speaking, everyone applauded sincerely. Tang also answered questions, saying that the authorities have already arranged garrison points to maintain discipline, not only paying attention to this city, but also to the area within 50 kilometers of the city. Those who are allowed to enter the city must declare that they are willing to coexist and die together. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Zhenjiang Fiercely</h3>
<p>About 140 Bombs Dropped; The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is Bombed Again</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yesterday, several Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed Zhenjiang, dropping about 140 bombs. The purpose of this bombing was probably to hinder the efforts of the Chinese army to consolidate the blockade. Several hundred coolies are now carrying stones to fill civilian ships and sink them into the river. It is not yet known how many were killed or injured in yesterday's attack. There are still four or five British expatriates in Zhenjiang, and the British gunboat Aphis will remain there to protect them, even if the route is blocked. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] This morning, several Japanese aircraft bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway again, causing the telegraphic communication between Hong Kong and Guangdong to be blocked. Japanese aircraft also dropped bombs in the northern and eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, and the number of losses and casualties is not yet known. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>[Jinan] ㊀ On the 26th, after our army recovered Liaocheng and Tangyi, they took advantage of the victory to attack and completely cleared the Japanese army in Roping, Boping, Xiajin, and Wucheng. ㊁ After the Japanese army in Putai fled after our attack, they were ambushed by our ambush, and some of them were trapped in the city and guarded. We are besieging them. Dozens of people were killed in this battle, including two squadron leaders. More than 20 guns were captured. A certain leader of our team was also slightly injured. ㊂ The Japanese artillery position that fired on us this morning was on the northwest side of Queshan, and its observation post was on the top of Queshan. At noon, after our artillery concentrated its firepower and carried out suppression, its observation post was destroyed without leaving anything behind. The artillery lost its ears and eyes and became silent. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Bank of China Plans to Establish Guilin Branch</h3>

<h3>A Mother and Three Children are Destitute</h3>
<p>Renewed Request for Assistance from All Circles</p>
<p>A news item was published in this newspaper a few days ago, please help Ms. Zeng Zhiying, a refugee, whose husband died, whose family is poor, pregnant, and has three children, and has no one to rely on. We respectfully request assistance from readers. It is known that since the publication of the news, it has had a considerable effect, but according to the woman's reply yesterday, she is pregnant, in great pain, and fears miscarriage. Moreover, at this time of severe cold, she is destitute. I dare to ask kind-hearted people to donate a few dollars again to maintain the lives of her mother and three children. If all circles are willing to help, please send the money directly to Ms. Chuan at the attic room on the second floor of No. 12 Quanyuli at the end of Annakin Road in the French Concession, Nanyang Zaofang Back Gate, for transfer to Ms. Cao Zhiying.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Authorities Welcome Refugees to Cultivate Land</h3>
<p>Recent news about the resettlement of refugees for land cultivation, according to the Bureau for Handling the Matter, there are many households who are responsible for attracting and registering refugees. Because this matter is of great importance and requires a lot of funds, it has now been decided that the first batch of 100 households will be moved to Liyang, Gaochun, and other places for resettlement, but there is very little open space there and cannot accommodate them. Now the Jiangxi provincial authorities welcome immigrants to cultivate land, because since the suppression of bandits in the province, the population has suddenly decreased, and there is a lot of arable land.</p>
<h3>Desolate Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>In normal times, transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou was extremely quick. Setting off from Shanghai in the morning, one could savor West Lake tea by noon, leisurely roam the lakefront for half the afternoon, and then take a train from the city station. The stable and fast Shanghai-Hangzhou train would safely carry you back to Shanghai before 11 o'clock at night.</p>
<p>Even for letters, a fast letter sent out in the morning might receive a reply by midnight. Long-distance calls, needless to say, transmitted voices instantaneously, without any sense of distance. There was also the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, where car enthusiasts constantly sped along the road. My friend, Mr. Shi, once drove at high speed, taking only two and a half hours to race from the inner West Lake to Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai.</p>
<p>But what about now? News from Hangzhou is completely cut off. People concerned about the lake can only rely on fragmented rumors, saying that Hangzhou is extremely chaotic, or that West Lake has become as desolate as a dead city.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, a friend from Hangzhou suddenly arrived. From his mouth, I learned something about the recent situation in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>He traveled from Hangzhou to Ningbo, took a ship to Shanghai, and safely passed through Wusongkou, stepping onto the relatively safer Shanghai concession. He said: "Hangzhou is indeed a dead city now! Almost two-thirds of the people have fled to the countryside. Since the fall of Jiaxing, the people of Hangzhou have been truly terrified. Important institutions have all moved to Jinhua. Even the outspoken Southeast Daily has moved to Jinhua for publication. The streets are deserted, you can't find a single car, and even rickshaws are hiding. The only residents left in Hangzhou are the poor. Although they know that their lives are important and that a temporary escape is necessary for safety, they are trapped by money and cannot leave, so they can only submit to fate!</p>
<p>“After the outbreak of the Battle of Songhu, wealthy residents of Hangzhou considered Mogan Mountain a safe haven. They brought their wives and children and climbed the mountain in droves. Deep in the bamboo forest, it was like a paradise. But recently, Huzhou became tense, and people in the mountains flocked back to Hangzhou. The most difficult thing was that military transport was frequent on this route, and there were no cars to ride. They had to take a waterway from Sanqiaobu to Hangzhou, which was slow and worrisome, truly quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>"From the perspective of the situation, Hangzhou is not in immediate danger. However, the panic felt by the people of Hangzhou is as if a large army is pressing down on them, which is truly inexplicable. Tourists on the lake have disappeared, and the cold electric lights at night sway with the strong autumn wind, creating an especially bleak and desolate scene.</p>
<p>Suzhou, which, like Hangzhou, is considered paradise, has met a tragic fate. I can't bear to imagine the future of Hangzhou!"</p>

<h3>I Firmly Defend Jiangyin and Changzhou, Fierce Fighting on the Zhejiang-Anhui Border</h3>
<p>The front line is over twenty kilometers from Guangde. A major fire in Yixing City makes the situation critical. There are no changes to our positions in Xiaoshi and Haiyan.</p>
<p>There were no major changes yesterday in the battles on both the north and south banks of Taihu Lake and on the various front lines. The situations in Jiangyin, Changzhou, Yixing, and Guangde are extremely tense. Although the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks on multiple fronts, our army is still firmly defending. The following are news reports from various sources: ㊀ Japanese troops from Wuxi are attacking Jiangyin Fortress along the Xicheng Highway. They encountered resistance from our army in Qingyang Town, south of Jiangyin, and fierce fighting has broken out there. However, Jiangyin Fortress is indeed being firmly defended by our army, and its defensive positions are solid and well-fortified. It will be difficult for the Japanese army to occupy it in the short term, and breaking through the blockade line will not be easy. Artillery battles are still very intense in Duanshan and Wushan. ㊁ Japanese troops attacking Changzhou along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line have stopped west of Shitangwan and Luoshe. Qishuyan and Henglin are still in our hands, and fierce fighting has also broken out. ㊂ Japanese troops from Changxing are also invading on two fronts. Those invading Guangde in southern Anhui were intercepted by our army in Sian Town and have advanced to Changming Village on the Zhejiang-Anhui border, further west being Anhui territory. Our army is deploying defenses on various mountain ridges and high ground, waiting in full battle array. The front line is still over twenty kilometers from Guangde. Japanese planes continue to bomb Guangde all the way to Wuhu. ㊃ Japanese troops from Changxing who went north to invade Yixing, after meeting up with the landing troops in Jiapu Town, are encircling Yixing. Yixing City is being fiercely bombed by Japanese planes, causing major fires in many places. Although the situation is very tense, our fresh troops have rushed to the front line to intercept them. ㊄ There are no changes on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road front. However, Japanese troops in Wuxing have moved south on two fronts, one along the highway attempting to threaten Hangzhou via Wukang. They encountered resistance from our army in Baisha Village and Sanqiaobu, west of Mogan Mountain, and suffered heavy losses. The other is attacking Chongde via Linghu and Xinshi. There are reports that Shimenwan has been captured. Xiaoshi and Haiyan are relatively quiet, but Japanese warships in Hangzhou Bay are constantly shelling various points near Haiyan.</p>
<h3>Main Force of Japanese Army Invades Guangde</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to news from Chinese sources, Changxing has indeed fallen, but small squads of loyal Chinese troops are still resisting outside Changxing. Therefore, although the Japanese army has broken through Changxing and is attacking Yixing and Guangde, fighting is still going on in the Changxing area. The main force of the Japanese army now seems to be attacking Guangde, because Guangde is already in Anhui territory, and from there they can bypass Nanjing's back. As for Yixing, it is also crucial to Nanjing's fate, because if Yixing is occupied, the Zhenjiang and Changzhou areas will be under extreme threat. (Quick News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Although the Changxing front line was broken through by the Japanese army after Wuxing, fighting in the suburbs has not stopped. The Japanese army is again attempting to invade Guangde along the Chang-Guang Highway. The vanguard has reached Changming Village, over twenty kilometers from Guangde, and has engaged in very fierce fighting with our defending troops, who are waiting in full battle array. The area is full of high mountains and ridges, which are easy to defend and difficult to attack. Our side is relying on this natural barrier to deploy heavy troops and is determined to defend it to the death. Guangde is located at the intersection of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, a place of strategic importance for military strategists. Our large force of fresh troops is stationed in the area of Shibalidian and Bujia Ancestral Hall, fifteen miles east of Guangde, while strong troops are operating in the area of Huaxi Market and Hexi Town, near the suburbs of Sian and Changxing, to contain the Japanese army's flanks and rear. They will definitely inflict considerable damage on the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Our Army Defends Jiangyin Fortress</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to news received here, fierce bloody battles are currently taking place near Qishuyan, between Wuxi and Changzhou. There have been no changes in the Chinese army's positions. Japanese troops from Wuxi have attacked Jiangyin Fortress along the Wuxi-Jiangyin Highway. The fighting in that area was intense throughout yesterday, with heavy casualties on both sides. The Chinese army is still holding its original positions. (Quick News Agency telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Over Two Hundred Japanese Planes Fly West</h3>
<p>Around 6:00 AM yesterday, about thirty Japanese heavy bombers flew out from the Yangshupu area. Unexpectedly, around 9:30 AM, another large number of white-gray heavy bombers flew out from the Wusong area. At first, there were three or four squadrons of only three planes each, followed by four or five squadrons. Around 11:00 AM, more and more planes flew out, numbering no less than one or two hundred. They all flew west along the Yangtze River and the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. Including the planes that flew out in the morning, there were about two hundred planes in total. It is said that these planes were recently shipped to Shanghai by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Transport Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, another large number of Japanese transport ships arrived in Shanghai, totaling eleven ships, including the Taiheiyo Maru, Maanshan Maru, Darong Maru, Shiyou Ryou Maru, Aden Maru, Taian Maru, Daini Kiri Maru, Daisan Kiri Maru, and Bering Maru. They imported over a hundred military vehicles, three hundred military horses, and a large number of boxed bullets, as well as large quantities of provisions and large amounts of gasoline for aircraft and military trucks. They also brought in countless small motorboats and a large amount of military supplies. After arriving in Shanghai, the ships were berthed at the Osaka, Mitsui, Zhongzhan, and Xinhuishan wharves, where they immediately began unloading and landing. Yesterday, many small steamers on the Suzhou Creek towed large barges full of grain, vegetables, and military equipment, escorted by the Japanese army, towards Kunshan. According to the North China Daily News, the Japanese army again forcibly seized six or seven small sand boats on the Suzhou Creek yesterday and towed them into the Huangpu River, as they did on Saturdays and Sundays. Japanese soldiers went to arrest them by gasoline boat. It is reported that Chinese people and their families working for the Japanese were given food by the Japanese. Yesterday, many civilian boats, cargo boats, sand boats, and other vessels parked in the Suzhou Creek flew foreign flags of Britain, the United States, France, Portugal, Italy, and Germany, probably for fear of being forcibly seized by the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Most British Nationals Moved to Hulks Yesterday; American, German, and Dutch Women Also Reside on Ships</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Most British nationals, along with American, German, and Dutch women, have moved to hulks today as a precautionary measure. The British nationals remaining in Nanjing had all gathered at the British Embassy or nearby. The area is not far from the river. The relocation to the hulks was completed tonight. Although there is no immediate danger, everyone feels that they should sleep on the hulks at night, and if possible, go ashore during the day. They should not wait until the last minute to leave the city in a panic. Currently, the only British warship stationed in the capital is HMS Cricket. HMS Scarab will arrive here at the beginning of this week. There are currently forty-two American nationals in the capital, including thirty-five men and seven women. The American gunboat USS Palos and a merchant ship arriving from Hankou will transport these people out of Nanjing. However, thirty-two American missionaries, reporters, and newsreel photographers refuse to leave Nanjing, which is causing the American authorities great difficulty. (Reuters telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Attacked by Air Raids Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways Bombed</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 7:30 AM on the 29th, two squadrons of Japanese planes took off from Tangjiawan. One squadron of ten planes flew to the western suburbs of the province, intending to bomb the Shijing Arsenal. Our anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and the Japanese planes did not dare to fly low.

<h3>Britain and America Protest Against Japanese Interference in Chinese Customs</h3>
<p>Extremely Concerned About the Shanghai Situation; Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The American Ambassador to Japan, Grew, and the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, visited the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hirota, one after the other yesterday afternoon to hand over written notes regarding the Japanese handling of the Shanghai Customs. According to the Asahi Shimbun, this was a warning. Grew arrived at the Foreign Ministry at 2:00 PM, while Craigie arrived an hour later. The details of the meeting were kept highly secret. At 5:00 PM, Reuters inquired with the Allied News Agency and the British Embassy, both of which said they did not know the contents of the note. This morning, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson spoke to reporters about this matter, saying that the British and American notes were worded the same, expressing the British and American concern about the Shanghai Customs situation. The Japanese reply has not yet been issued. He also said that the Japanese army wanted to manage the Shanghai Customs, and they were well aware that foreign debts were secured by customs duties. However, given the current situation in Shanghai, the customs must be under the control of the Japanese army while the war continues, because the Japanese authorities cannot tolerate the Shanghai customs revenues being used to purchase munitions for China. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai recently reported to Tokyo that negotiations with local customs officials are progressing smoothly. The British and American Consuls-General in Shanghai have both made representations to the Japanese Consul-General, who has replied to them. The plans that Japan intends to implement in Shanghai are currently being drafted. Regarding this matter, he could not say whether Japan could consult with Britain, but Japan could handle it accordingly. It is too early to say what the outcome of the negotiations will be, but what he could say was that Japan would respect the interests of the powers. The spokesperson also answered various questions from reporters, saying that he believed that Japan had an obligation to respect foreign debts secured by customs duties. The customs debt owed by "Manchukuo" was about 10 to 20 million yuan and was currently held in the Central Bank of "Manchukuo." If the powers were willing to negotiate with "Manchukuo," he believed that this amount could be paid. Asked whether the Chinese tax revenue stored in the Japanese banks in North China could be allocated if the powers recognized the new North China government that Japan predicted would be established in the future, the spokesperson refused to answer this question. When discussing Chinese tariffs, the spokesperson was unwilling to disclose whether Britain and America had requested that they be consulted before the tariffs were revised, or whether Japan would extend its administrative powers to tariffs. Another official from the Foreign Ministry said that the legal and strategic issues in Shanghai were intertwined. Japan believed that the actions of the Japanese army in Shanghai, as long as they were deemed to be strategic matters, did not need to be discussed with Britain and America. Japan must have the right to act independently in this matter, but it would fully respect foreign interests. Japan did not want to interfere in the administrative powers of the Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council. In summary, what was being done was of a temporary nature and for military convenience. The method of Manchukuo offering part of its tax revenue to repay debts could be used again.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Writes to Jiangsu Adjustment Office Requesting Issuance of Food Circulation Permits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiangsu Food and Fuel Adjustment Office yesterday requesting the issuance of food circulation permits. The original letter stated: "To the Jiangsu Food and Fuel Adjustment Office, We are writing to you with reference to the matter of issuing Food Circulation Permits. According to the letter from the Bean and Rice Trade Association, our members Ren Cheng Xing and Wan Xing Yu Xing reported that the food situation in the city is worrying. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is urging the members to rush to procure food from various ports for relief purposes. Xiao Xing, etc. plan to procure 10,000 bags of rice and food each from Taixian and Tongzhou for the civilians. In addition to requesting a certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, we sincerely request that you authorize the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to prepare an official document for the Zhenjiang Food and Fuel Adjustment Office to issue Circulation Permits to facilitate the procurement of goods, etc. Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has requested us to prepare a document to Zhenjiang to facilitate their business, we request that you promptly forward the document of the Jiangsu Food and Fuel Adjustment Office to the Association, and then forward it to the said company to be forwarded to the companies for the Circulation Permits for procurement purposes. Now that Shanghai city's food grain supplies have been fully procured and transported as per your instructions, the said company is now procuring rice in Taixian and Nantong, which will definitely be needed for the food supply to the local civilians. With this letter, we have enclosed a certificate, and we request that you approve the immediate preparation of the document to be issued to the companies with Jiangsu Food and Fuel Adjustment Office's authorization so that the companies can obtain the circulation permits and facilitate their business. Sincerely we look forward to your prompt assistance. Upon investigation, Shanghai city has historically relied on supplies from the two regions of Su, Song and Chang. Since the internal transfer of the war situation has blocked the transportation routes, various rice shops are lacking in supply. The Shanghai Municipal Council is relying on the storage and procurement of foreign rice and distributing it for retail. However, there is a huge gap in supply and demand, and businesses often suspend operations while waiting for rice. In addition, the people of Shanghai rely entirely on foreign rice as an emergency relief measure, which is not a long-term solution. The Jiangbei and Xiahe regions have always been rice-producing areas, and the said rice merchants are now planning to send partners to Taixian and Nantong to procure rice, which will benefit the domestic agricultural production and the food supply to the people of Shanghai. We hereby request your office to approve the issuance of circulation permits to the said rice merchants so that they can purchase and transport rice.”</p>
<h3>Japan Restricts Gasoline Consumption</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Relies on Strength and Arms to Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>Litvinov Warns Aggressor Nations; US Navy Decides to Strengthen Defenses in Hawaii; Secretary of War Advocates Strengthening Land and Air Forces</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, gave a speech today to voters in Leningrad, criticizing "certain three countries" for openly violating the treaties they themselves had signed. Litvinov's intention was to refer to Germany, Japan, and Italy, but he did not specify. Litvinov also stated that these three countries openly announced their determination to seize the land of others and were unwilling to cooperate collectively with other countries. Other countries, although well aware of the great threat to peace, had not taken any further action other than making empty declarations, and therefore could have no impact. As for the Soviet Union's "peace efforts," in addition to proposing a disarmament plan to the League of Nations, it had also signed non-aggression treaties with ten of its neighboring countries. However, the Soviet Union's national defense did not rely on international cooperation, but on the continued progress of its land, sea, and air forces. (Guomin telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>[Washington] An Associated Press reporter learned today that the United States Navy Department believes that if war breaks out in the Pacific, the Philippines will inevitably be indefensible. Therefore, the United States' national defense should focus on Hawaii. The department is now planning a program to strengthen Hawaii's defenses, including: ㊀ Increasing the number of land and naval aircraft stationed in Hawaii; ㊁ Greatly increasing coastal defense heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns, and rapidly modernizing various defense equipment; ㊂ Establishing underground cellars in the Wake Island area of Hawaii to store ammunition and fuel, and building bomb-proof, concealed aircraft hangars; ㊃ Widely constructing fortifications on the coast to shelter submarines and naval aircraft; ㊄ Developing civilian air defense bases in the Hawaii area. (Guomin telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of War Woodring released the Army Department's annual report today, in which he strongly advocated that strengthening military power was the best way to maintain peace. Because war clouds are gathering everywhere in the world, maintaining peace is not easy. Therefore, the report recommended that the United States Air Force implement a wartime organization. As for the United States Army, although it had made considerable progress compared to previous peacetime, it was still too weak compared to other countries. The report listed seven recommendations, which are roughly as follows: ㊀ The number of officers should be increased every year for the next four or five years; ㊁ The salaries of junior officers and soldiers should be raised; ㊂ The number of national defense officers and soldiers should be increased to 210,000; ㊃ Increased the facilities for training reserve officers; ㊄ There should always be 150,000 special technical personnel as reserves; ㊅ Increased the speed of modernizing the army; ㊆ The Army Department should build a new building. It is claimed that the US Army currently has 1,000 aircraft that are less than three years old, and another 1,000 have already been ordered. The target for July 1940 is estimated to be 2,320 aircraft. (Guomin telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Britain Expands Air Force</h3>
<p>Number of First-Line Aircraft for National Defense to Increase to 8,000 Next Year</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Herald reports that by the end of 1938, Britain will have as many as 8,000 first-line military aircraft. At that time, aircraft manufacturers will be able to produce 5,000 aircraft annually, but there may be a shortage of trained pilots. Currently, the British Royal Air Force has a total of 2,000 first-line aircraft and many reserve aircraft. (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Talks Begin on International Situation</h3>
<p>Exchanging Important Views on Germany's Proposal</p>
<p>[London] French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos arrived in London at 11:07 PM last night. This morning, they will begin talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden on the overall European situation and the Far East crisis. They will also discuss the recent talks between Lord Privy Seal Halifax and German leader Hitler, among other matters. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>[London] At 11:00 AM this morning, French Prime Minister Chautemps and Foreign Minister Delbos, along with French Ambassador to London Corbin, Secretary-General of the French Foreign Ministry Chin Yue, Director of Political and Commercial Affairs Marsigli, and First Secretary of the French Embassy Machiri, went to 10 Downing Street to formally discuss important world affairs with British Prime Minister Chamberlain. The French Prime Minister's entourage arrived in London after 11:00 PM last night and were greeted at the station by Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart. Due to the recent developments in international affairs, the public is paying close attention to these talks. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>[London] The talks between the key figures of Britain and France have continued all day without stopping, not even during lunchtime, making it extremely difficult for outsiders to obtain information. However, it is heard that during the talks this morning, Lord Privy Seal Halifax reported on his recent talks in Germany with Chancellor Hitler and Aviation Minister Göring. Furthermore, before Halifax's trip to Germany, former Aviation Minister Londonderry had visited Berlin and returned with documents containing the German government's point of view. These documents were also discussed jointly by the key figures of Britain and France this morning. In addition, it is generally believed that the politicians of both countries will exchange views this afternoon on the issue of Germany's demand for colonies. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>[London] Reuters has learned that the Anglo-French talks, which British officials consider extremely important, will focus on efforts to bring the Axis powers of Germany and Italy closer to Britain and France. The highest authorities have firmly stated that the outcome of these Anglo-French talks will not change the fundamental points of British policy, nor will it cause France to revise its policies regarding the Franco-Soviet pact. Germany now understands the reasons for the Anglo-French meeting, which is a source of satisfaction for London officials. Britain will not try to influence the Axis powers of Germany and Italy, and Germany will not attempt to change the special relationship between Britain and France. To reduce misunderstandings between the two sides, there is no question of harming others to benefit oneself. Any plan aimed at harming others has never been suggested, and Britain would never want this either. Germany has not demanded a plebiscite in Austria or a change in the political situation in Czechoslovakia. However, there are indeed differences between Britain, Germany, and Italy, such as the colonial issue. Britain recognizes the difficulty of the colonial issue but believes that this difficulty is not only related to Britain but also to France, Belgium, and the three major British dominions. This matter will definitely be discussed during the Anglo-French talks. Even without Lord Privy Seal Halifax's visit to Germany, Anglo-French talks would still be necessary, as other important issues, such as the situation in Spain, can be studied in this opportunity. London officials believe that the situation in Spain is not as serious as it has been at any time in the past eighteen months, and the interest in intervention from all sides is not as strong as before. However, it would be a mistake to say that the Spanish war will end soon. Since the war cannot end soon, Spain and the Mediterranean will ultimately be a problem requiring Anglo-French consultation. Although the European situation remains difficult and worrying, the opportunity for war, even if lurking, will not break out for the time being. Therefore, diplomacy still has the opportunity to adjust the international atmosphere and reduce its temperature. In addition, an important issue is the Far East situation. The situation in the Far East is now very serious and is related to the significant interests of Britain and France, especially the two concessions in Shanghai and the colonies of Hong Kong and Vietnam, which are directly related to Britain and France. This relationship should be the basis for Anglo-French joint research on this problem. In a broad sense, Britain's aim is to cooperate closely with allied countries in diplomatic negotiations, as France, the United States, and Britain have now adopted in Tokyo. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden will hold preliminary consultations tonight on the agenda for this week's talks. Lord Privy Seal Halifax will also frequently attend the talks. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Deny Lending to China</h3>
<p>The "Tokyo Daily News" Spreads Rumors; Appears to Have an Agenda</p>
<p>[London] Responsible circles in London today completely denied the report in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun that Wellington Koo and foreign representatives at the meeting in that city had agreed on a huge loan for arms, saying that the Chinese side had not made any loan proposal that could serve as the basis for the report. Londoners all laugh at this news. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>[Paris] It is rumored that Britain, France, the United States, Russia, and Belgium have secretly lent China a huge sum of 100 million pounds to be used for the purchase of arms. Responsible French officials have formally denied this. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun today published a piece from its correspondent in Paris, Kido, in large characters, stating that Dr. Wellington Koo is currently negotiating a huge loan for arms with the major powers. Kido said that after the end of the Brussels Conference, Koo began negotiations with representatives of the United States, France, Belgium, and the Soviet Union at the conference, requesting them to supply arms and ammunition worth 100 million pounds. Koo claimed that if China did not receive this loan, the interests of the major powers in China would be swept away. Koo secretly visited British and American representatives on November 22, requesting them to actively assist, otherwise China would not be able to sustain itself. The representatives of the five countries then held a secret meeting and were reportedly willing to assist China in resisting Japan. Kido also said that Chiang Kai-shek requested a loan of 100 million pounds at 3% interest to purchase a large number of military supplies, including 1,000 aircraft, 150 field guns, 324 anti-aircraft guns, 5,000 heavy machine guns, 15,000 light machine guns, and millions of shells. Kido concluded by saying that Japan should be aware that the opportunity for the major powers to jointly assist China is now maturing behind the scenes. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>[Tokyo] It is reported that after a thorough investigation of the various economic factors in North China, the Cabinet Planning Board has decided to establish a North China Planning Committee to formulate concrete plans for the development of North China's economy.

According to this policy, various industrial and commercial companies will be formed under the joint plan of Japan, Manchuria, and China. ㊁ Invite foreign investment to participate in the development of North China's business to comply with the open-door policy. ㊂ The various plans for the development of North China's economy and industry will be formulated in accordance with the industrial policies of Japan and Manchuria, so that the three countries can be in an inseparable economic relationship and form a whole economic group. ㊃ In principle, private investment and operation can be allowed as much as possible, but basic industries and defense industries will be placed under Japanese management, such as transportation, port construction, electricity, steel, coal, and salt, all of which will be managed and operated on a monopoly basis. ㊄ The operation of the iron industry will be by the Japan Iron &amp; Steel Co., the coal industry by representatives of the Japan Coal Mining Association, the transportation industry by the South Manchuria Railway, the electricity industry by the Japan Electric Power Association, the telephone and telegraph industry by the Manchuria Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co., and the salt industry by the China Development Co. North China's cotton industry will be operated by the Japan Textile Industry Federation, the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, and the China Development Co. ㊅ In order to manage and supervise the above-mentioned undertakings, a supreme control company will be formed. Within this supreme company, the interests of the above-mentioned companies will be able to participate, and the plans of each company must be approved by this supreme company. ㊆ Japan will find ways to provide the funds needed for this kind of undertaking, provide guarantees for the undertaking, and provide certain conveniences.

<h3>Telegraph Communications Severed After Telegraph Bureau Taken Over</h3>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces Can Forward Messages Via Hong Kong; International Communications Remain Unobstructed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was taken over by the Japanese side on the 28th. The bureau has automatically stopped receiving and sending messages. Currently, in this city, in addition to the fact that wireless communications with the international community are still open, domestic telegrams have been completely cut off. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Stopping Receiving and Sending Telegrams</p>
<p>The Japanese side declared that after implementing the takeover of Shanghai's transportation agencies, they sent people to inspect the International Wireless Station, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and other transportation agencies on the 27th and held negotiations with the staff of each agency, but without result. At 4:00 PM on the 28th, the Japanese side sent personnel, accompanied by detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Council, to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications on Szechuan Road, the telegraph office at 591 Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, the radio transmission station at Megan Road and Xinzha Road, and the Sassoon House broadcasting station, declaring that they were implementing the takeover and posting announcements stating that all incoming and outgoing telegrams would be subject to inspection. Our staff still hoped to cooperate with the Japanese side and work with peace of mind. However, the bureau needed to consult with the Ministry of Communications and found it difficult to accept. Therefore, they were forced to notify the telegraph bureaus in other cities and all sectors in this city from 10:00 PM on the evening of the 28th, stopping the receiving and sending of telegrams. Telegrams received before 10:00 PM were still sent as before, but they were not inspected by the Japanese side. The Japanese side also sent personnel to guard the bureau. The bureau's staff did not go to the bureau to work that night. As for the telegraph office, because it needed to send out the accumulated telegrams, it still worked on the evening of the 28th.</p>
<p>Complete Severance of Telegraph Communications</p>
<p>After the bureau stopped receiving and sending, telegraph communications between this city and other cities have been completely cut off. The telegraph bureau is divided into wired and wireless. Since August 13th, wired telegrams have been interrupted due to line breaks, and the machines have long been out of service. All telegrams are received and sent by wireless telegraph machines to communicate with various places. Now that wireless communication has stopped, domestic telegraph lines have been completely cut off. However, telegrams to Guangdong and Guangxi in South China can be forwarded by the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific underwater telegraph companies via Hong Kong. As for international communications, because the international radio station is operated by foreigners and is not hindered, it is still unobstructed.</p>
<p>Planning to Restore Telegraph Communications</p>
<p>The responsible parties of the telegraph bureau believe that the interruption of telegraph communications is detrimental to the commercial interests of both Chinese and foreigners in this city and to the interests of the citizens. In order to avoid a long-term interruption, in addition to immediately consulting the responsible agency, the Ministry of Communications, they also plan to discuss a proper solution with the relevant parties in order to restore telegraph communications. Detailed information may be clarified within two or three days. Yesterday, all the agencies of the telegraph bureau were closed, and there was no one inside. The Japanese personnel taking over the bureau are still stationed there.</p>
<p>Joint Registered Mail Office Operates as Usual</p>
<p>The gate of the general bureau on Szechuan Road is tightly closed. In addition to the announcement of the cessation of telegram reception and dispatch at the entrance, it also notifies that "all customers who change their address and renew their registration fees are requested to go to the receiving and dispatch office of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific underwater telegraph companies on the Bund of Avenue Edward VII to be handled at the Joint Telegraph Registry." As for the International Wireless Station in the Sassoon Building on the Bund and the receiving office on Avenue Edward VII, they both received and sent all international wireless telegrams yesterday as usual. The receiving and dispatch office of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific underwater telegraph companies at 34 Avenue Edward VII received and sent international underwater telegrams as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper's Description of the Takeover Situation</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese authorities took over the Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau yesterday. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a group of Japanese went to a long alley behind the Country Hospital to take over the telegraph bureau. There were about ten people in total, all in plain clothes, including police officers from the Japanese Consulate and five Japanese detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police. A Western detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station then remained with two police officers from the Japanese Consulate and one Japanese detective from the Hongkou Police Station at the bureau. The remaining people went to inspect nearby Chinese government radio stations. The telegraph operators and messengers in the telegraph bureau continued to serve as usual until their shift ended. At 8:00 PM, another group of Japanese officers arrived at the bureau in three cars and stayed for several minutes, including the Japanese chief inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police. At that time, there were two Japanese detectives stationed in the bureau. However, the Chinese Telegraph Bureau at the corner of Szechuan Road and Fuzhou Road and the Chinese Government Wireless Telegraph Bureau in the Sassoon Building have apparently not yet been taken over. It is heard that the person in charge of the South Telegraph Bureau met with Japanese officials several times last week. In addition, there is a telegraph bureau located at 14 Avenue Edward VII. The telegraph bureau on Jing'an Temple Road is the South City branch, which was moved there from Min'guo Road on September 1.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Office Operates As Usual</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Office at 13 The Bund and all its subordinate divisions, sections, inspection offices, customs houses, package inspection offices, shipping agency, etc., and the Supervisory Commissioner's Office at 1331 Xinzha Road all operated as usual yesterday. The North-China Daily News reported that a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy yesterday declared that the actions taken by the Japanese authorities against the Chinese Customs were due to the governmental nature of the said agency. The Customs is an agency of the Nanking Government, and its revenue is pledged to foreign banks. Because it has an international nature, the two cannot be mixed together. The first step taken by the Japanese authorities was to take over the agency. We do not believe that anyone can object to the Japanese authorities taking over an agency of the Chinese government. The spokesperson also answered questions, saying that the actions taken by the Japanese authorities had not yet entered the second stage. The Japanese authorities will take into account the interests of the powers regarding the issue of customs revenue being used to repay foreign debts, but we have not yet reached this stage. The spokesperson acknowledged that Tokyo had received inquiries from the British and American governments regarding the Japanese authorities' takeover of the Customs.</p>
<h3>Post Office Operates Calmly</h3>
<p>Parcels to Shandong and Zhejiang Suspended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, under the leadership of the Postmaster, is operating normally and calmly. However, due to transportation disruptions, parcel service to multiple locations has been suspended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Post Office Operates Calmly</p>
<p>All departments of the Szechuan Road Bridge Postal Administration were working normally yesterday morning, handling postal affairs. Postmaster Jappé arrived at the bureau every day during office hours to supervise bureau affairs. However, the Joint Postal Service and other sections that moved to the Yuyuan Road Post Office during the Shanghai War have not yet moved back and are still operating in Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>Mail Waiting to Be Cleared</p>
<p>In Shanghai's Nanshi, Pudong, and other areas, due to changing circumstances, many residents have moved away, resulting in a backlog of mail that cannot be delivered to the recipients. Other parcels and packages have suffered the same fate and cannot be cleared. These difficulties cannot be resolved in a short period of time and await the clarification of the situation. However, the bureau is still working hard to clear them as much as possible and has designated several branch offices as places for recipients in the war zone to collect their mail.</p>
<p>Locations Where Parcels Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>As the war in Shandong Province is expanding and the Jiaoji Railway is blocked, the bureau has begun to suspend the acceptance of parcels passing through the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong Province starting today. However, parcels to Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei can still be sent. At the same time, parcels to all parts of Zhejiang Province have also been suspended due to transportation difficulties.</p>
<h3>Governance of Extraterritorial Roads Temporarily Changes</h3>
<p>Criminal Cases Handled by Special Court No. 1; Security Provided by Detectives from the Police</p>
<p>Since our army withdrew from Shanghai, the Nanshi District Court has also been ordered to close. Therefore, criminal cases involving extraterritorial roads, which were previously handled by the court, are now handled by Special Court No. 1. Also, theft cases have occurred frequently in the Caojiadu area recently. In order to maintain security in the area, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police plans to establish a branch of the Jing'an Temple Police Station in the area and assign detectives to maintain security. The location will be at the original site of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau. It is heard that this measure will be implemented starting on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Encourage Factories to Reopen</h3>
<p>And Promise to Assist in Every Way</p>
<p>After the suburbs of Shanghai became war zones, all factories were closed. As for the factories south of the Suzhou River in the International Settlement and the French Concession, they have gradually reopened after the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs promoted their reopening and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce encouraged them to do so. Now that the authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession see that order in Shanghai is gradually returning, they are encouraging those who have not reopened to find ways to do so and promise to assist them. Various factories, such as textile, silk reeling, weaving, cigarette, and flour factories, have reopened first, temporarily opening regular day shifts. As for the issue of transporting products and raw materials, the factories all hope that the concession authorities will assist them.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai and Others Go to Hong Kong and Then to Wuhan</h3>
<p>The New Sound Society says that Wang Xiaolai, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Local Association, and Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, left Shanghai for Hong Kong and then to Wuhan the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Fire at Jing'an Bathhouse</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the Jing'an Bathhouse at 3 Jing'an Temple Road. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade heard the alarm and immediately drove to the scene to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. One house was destroyed.</p>

<h3>The Businessmen's Association of the Refugee Zone Urges Merchants to Return and Resume Business</h3>
<p>Qu Wenliu Accepts Opinions from Representatives of the Businessmen's Association - French Police Promise to Alleviate the Plight of Merchants Returning to the Zone - Refugees are Suffering from Cold and Hunger, Hoping for Prompt Donations</p>
<p>The Businessmen's Association of the Refugee Zone in this city states that since Father Jacquinot bravely planned the area, the merchants and refugees gathered there have strictly maintained order, and local affairs have been progressing daily. However, the issue of expanding the zone has not yet been resolved, so refugees sleeping in the streets and alleys have not been fully accommodated. Some larger merchants in the zone recently elected Shen Xinfu, the chairman of the association, as their representative, to submit documents to various relevant parties with requests on various points, which have been disclosed in various newspapers. It is now learned that the French authorities have opened the iron gate at the Old North Gate, allowing entry into the refugee zone. In recent days, Southern City merchants who have been displaced to the concession have been returning to the zone in droves, and even refugees in the concession without shelters have been sneaking in. As a result, the number of people in the zone has suddenly increased. Currently, the Businessmen's Association is actively working to regulate goods to solve problems such as the opening of stores and business operations, and entry and exit from the concession. Special representatives, including Director of Committee Xi Guansheng, Fan Zhongzhang, Lin Huiren, Zhang Binru, Xiao Zizhen, Le Zixiang, and Wu Xiaoyun, have been appointed to find solutions and to visit the shelters in the concession to comfort the displaced merchants who have not yet returned to the zone. Yesterday, Shen Xinfu, the chairman of the association, together with various committee members, went to the Refugee Relief Branch of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association to visit Vice Chairman Zhang Binghui and present various points. Then, Mei Jianyin of the association's inspection team instructed the representatives to visit the Southern City refugees in the shelters. Following that, they went to the International Relief Committee, where Chairman Qu Wenliu personally received them. The representatives submitted a letter, stating the unemployment and suffering of the displaced merchants after returning to the zone, and the urgent need to find ways for them to operate their businesses to maintain their livelihoods. Qu accepted the representatives' opinions and instructed them to present everything to Father Jacquinot, the person in charge of the Refugee Zone Office. Subsequently, they went to the French Consulate, where Secretary Zhang Wenbin received them. Zhang stated that in this extraordinary period, the defense of the French Concession is jointly responsible by the Navy, Army, and Police Department. The issue of entry and exit after opening the iron gate must be handled seriously. He will translate the original letter into French and forward it to the Consul. He will then send a letter to the French Police Department and various Chinese Directors, requesting them to find ways to alleviate the plight of merchants returning to the zone, so that they can have a means of livelihood and issue merchant passes as soon as possible to regulate goods in the zone. The police and the Chinese Directors have agreed to do their best to find solutions. The representatives then returned to Southern City and will visit Father Jacquinot again.</p>
<p>Extremely Cold Weather Causes Many Deaths</p>
<p>The refugees in the various shelters are now suffering from cold and hunger and are in a miserable state. Forty percent of them have no cotton clothes to keep warm. The supply of food for the city's 400,000-plus refugees is enormous, and many are dying from cold and hunger, especially infants and the elderly. It is hoped that the ladies and gentlemen living within the concessions, with their compassionate hearts, will donate cash and cotton clothing. Donations can be sent directly to: ㊀ 2nd Floor, Pudong Native Association, corner of Avenue Edward VII and Chengdu Road; ㊁ Renji Hall on Six Roads; ㊂ 2nd Floor, YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge. The representatives also stated that the Businessmen's Association of the Refugee Zone is dedicated to restoring industry and commerce. The office is still located at 1 Gezhi'an Lane, Luxiang Garden, and does not accept any donations on behalf of others. If donations are entrusted, they will not have time to accept them. Please send them directly to the above three locations. It is also hoped that merchants in the zone will stay at home as much as possible during this period, turn off the lights and go to bed early in the evening, personally check the doors, and avoid visiting good friends late at night. Do not buy goods of unknown origin to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>In the continuous cold weather, deaths of refugees in shelters and vagrant refugees along the streets are constantly being heard, especially among the refugees in the Refugee Zone of Southern City. Although the International Relief Committee, charity organizations, and others have repeatedly rushed to distribute clothing and bedding, the number is limited, and there is a shortage of children's clothing, so the situation is quite serious. More than a hundred refugees and child victims are dying every day as a result. If diseases are added, the mortality rate will increase further. It is hoped that enthusiastic ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life will generously donate clothing and bedding to provide relief quickly.</p>
<p>A One-Cent Donation is Rewarded with a Commemorative Badge</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee is promoting a one-cent daily donation to relieve refugees. To commemorate the enthusiasm of the donors, a special "One-Cent Donation Movement Commemorative Badge" has been made. Anyone who donates one cent per day, totaling three yuan for a month, will receive a receipt from the committee and a commemorative badge as a memento. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will jointly promote and implement this movement to accumulate sand into a tower and benefit the victims. The committee continued to receive one-cent donations yesterday, including 48 yuan from Yiji Xing, 12 yuan from HSBC, 36 yuan from Yichang, 5 yuan from the staff of China Tianyi Insurance Company, 6 yuan and 70 cents from the residents of 16 Zhenping Lane, and 3 yuan from Gu Wendiao, which is very encouraging.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Actively Provides Relief</p>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society, in order to relieve refugees in the Sujia area, sent President Wang Daoyuan and staff members Song Xinhao and others to Ningbo and then Hangzhou by boat to discuss relief matters with the local branches. According to a telegram, there are many refugees in both places, and due to the cold weather, the people are displaced and in a miserable situation, urgently awaiting relief. In addition to the 1,000 yuan that has already been taken there, the Society has successively remitted 1,600 yuan and is actively raising funds. After President Wang finishes his work in Hangzhou, he will go to Fuzhou. It is reported that the Fuzhou branch has sent a relief team to Xiamen to work. It is also learned that residents of the Suxi Cheng area are moving to Zhenjiang for shelter. The Society has remitted 2,000 yuan to the Zhenjiang branch to handle relief matters.</p>
<h3>Bean, Rice, and Cereal Merchants Groups Coordinate Food Sources</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Guarantees Transportation Safety and Will Order More from Saigon if Needed</p>
<p>After the China Rice Industry Company ordered foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for regulation, and various food groups made every effort to coordinate sources, rice merchants have resumed business, and there is no danger of food shortages for the people of Shanghai. The Rice Merchant Guild started yesterday to distribute three batches of foreign rice. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Industry Groups Coordinate Sources</p>
<p>The Bean, Rice, and Cereal Guilds are making every effort to coordinate sources, adjust prices, and purchase 300,000 dan of domestic rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. It has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has issued a certificate to be transferred by the two guilds to the rice shops that purchase domestic rice. The rice shops have sent telegrams to the above three places to find ways to purchase, and have negotiated with the British companies Taikoo and Jardine Matheson to arrange for ships to transport the rice. At the same time, the Public Concession's Municipal Council guarantees the safety of transportation.</p>
<p>China Rice Company Regulates Food Supply</p>
<p>The China Rice Industry Company is cooperating with the Public Concession's Municipal Council to purchase Saigon foreign rice to regulate the food supply for the people of Shanghai. A total of 115,000 bags have been shipped to Shanghai in four batches. The fourth batch is loaded on the Zhejiang ship, which was delayed until December 2 due to bad weather along the coast before it could arrive in Shanghai. It will be handled by the Rice Merchant Guild for retail sales. The money earned will be used for refugee relief. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the company yesterday that if it is deemed necessary by the market after the fourth batch of foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, they will order more from Saigon.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Guild Distributes Rice in Three Batches</p>
<p>The Rice Merchant Guild receives the foreign rice and hands it over to 500 rice shops for retail sales. The first and second batches have been distributed. The payment for the third batch started the day before yesterday and ended last night. The Rice Merchant Guild started to take rice from the Bank of China warehouse yesterday morning and distributed it to the member rice shops that have paid, with a total of 40 bags per shop. After the three batches have been completed, the application and registration for the fourth batch of foreign rice will be processed. The retail price set by the guild is 8.5 cents per jin, and with 160 jin per dan, it is 13 yuan and 60 cents per dan, which does not exceed 14 yuan.</p>
<h3>Obstruction of the Pudong West Ferry</h3>
<p>The temporary ferries between Pudong and the west side of the Huangpu River have been extremely crowded in recent days, with tens of thousands of passengers every day. The day before yesterday, the Japanese army in Pudong suddenly closed the Yangjing ferry. After the ferry company tried every means, only the Donggou and Gaoqiao ferries were opened. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, there was another problem on the Dongqing line. At about 8 a.m., two tugboats towing 16 barges carrying more than a thousand passengers sailed towards Donggou, but when they passed the Qichang Wharf on the Bund, they were suddenly blocked by a Japanese naval patrol boat firing shots. They temporarily turned back and announced ticket refunds. Therefore, more than 2,000 ferry passengers were stranded at the Customs Wharf before noon. Although the Chinese and Western police tried their best to maintain order, it was still extremely crowded. The ferry company had no choice but to tow three more boats to Donggou at noon for a trial run, and only arrived at the ferry at about 2 p.m. However, the Japanese discovered this and sent a patrol boat to fire shots and chase them back. All the civilians and vegetable vendors yesterday were unable to travel. As for the Gaoqiao line, the German and Italian ferries had taken a batch of passengers to Gaoqiao at 8 a.m. and safely returned 500 to 600 civilians and vegetable vendors to Shanghai at 11 a.m., bringing a batch of vegetables at the same time. However, the second trip, which was fully loaded with passengers departing for Gaoqiao at about 12 noon, was obstructed again. When it sailed near Donggou, the Japanese navy fired dozens of shots, and both ferries were blocked and returned, the passengers experienced a false alarm, and the tickets were refunded.</p>
