<h3>德王的野心㊁</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>想利用外力做成吉思汗　是位蒙古學者具有天才</p>
<p>㊁野心的促進</p>
<p>德王的老家是在滂江，滂江是蒙古話的譯音，這地方根本就沒有江河，眞如跟察境蒙政會所在地的嘉卜寺一樣，嘉卜寺亦是蒙古語，那邊亦沒有什麼廟宇，內地的旅客想去•遊覽滂江，嘉卜寺那就鬧成笑話了。德王的西蘇尼特旗王府佈置得很富麗，尤其是他的書房間，充滿看中外各種報章雜誌和其他許多書籍，壁間懸着希脫拉，墨索里尼凱末爾的肖像；在這裏他時常招待中外新聞記者，和遠道來的貴賓。他的確是位蒙古的學者，具有政治家的風度，豐富的世界智識，同時他還是位藝術家，音樂家，有極聰明的天才，唱歌繪畫都有相當功夫，他的騎馬本領更為不弱，跑馬射擊是他每天淸早的功課，發彈和射箭的命中率已經在水平綫以上，對於蒙古摔角也是一個好手，在府裏空閒的時候，有時玩玩照相，開開汽車，小機器也能自己修理，但是他的服裝起居飲食很為平民化，府裏雖然有北平厨子，除去宴客外，還是吃些蒙古普通東西。蒙古人具有古代的美德，最講信義交情，對於王爺的尊敬服從，對於喇嘛的誠心信仰，眞是五體投地，絲毫沒有不眞實的心理，所以對於這位能迎含時代潮流的摩登王爺當然格外加重地們的尊敬和服從心，很情願的聽他指揮驅策•德王的額前長有一顆黑痣，凑趣的人就說他有帝王之相，德王的野心也就因此勃發起來，同時再加以環境的凑合，物質的誘惑，使他的野心日就膨脹，終造成今日的局面。他妄想利用外力，恢復他祖先成吉思汗的功業，所以他這幾年來廣事搜羅有智識蒙古靑年，喊起蒙古民族解放的口號，要建立獨立矚家。他痛恨前淸對付蒙古的覊縻政策，尤其是牢不可破的宗敎信仰，認為喇嘛敎斷送了蒙古民族的生命，便竭力把新時代的學識向蒙古靑年灌送，一般蒙人接受了新的洗禮後，都認這位德王是成吉斯汗死後出現的彗星，許多比較頭腦新穎的王公也死心塌地的擁護他，祟敬他。德王一方面也因為求治太切的緣故，在蒙政會任秘書長時代，遇事把持，操縱一切，得罪了其他王公，造成了察綏盟旗分治的局面，同時因為種種導火綫的連續爆發，急速促成了他接受某方的侵蒙條件，甘心作傀儡領袖，來實現他做成吉思汗第二的迷夢。許多老成持重的蒙古有識之士對於德王急不暇擇的手段，當然都表示非常的不滿，就是德王本人自從綏戰失敗以來，也未嘗不痛定思痛，覺悟前非。有人問德王道：“你想利用人家，現在呢，人家倒把咱們夾持上了，動彈不得，這是從何說起！”德王當然是啞口無言。不過我們根據全國團結一致，中國人不打中國人的口號，總希望已被人家利用者能急速走上自新之路，我們當然可以寬其旣往，竭誠合作，况且德王確是位新時代人物，有一部份勢力，而某方滿蒙政策根本的打碎，必有待於滿蒙人本身的大澈大悟，從心理上築起長城，來抵抗毒辣的分化侵略。俗語云，往者已矣，來者可退，這是我們民衆對於德王所抱的唯一希望呀！</p>
<p>㊂陰謀與親善</p>
<p>某方實行掠奪內蒙的計劃，是與侵略華北相並進的，而其處心積慮於侵略蒙古陰謀的進行是遠在五十年以前。自從外蒙古傾向於蘇聯後，他們以內蒙與外蒙有廣大的接壤，是將來大陸大戰中的重要作戰陣地，所以掠奪內蒙的進行更加緊工作，並且內蒙有廣大的經濟資源，亦是某方資本主義特別垂涎的一端。某方特務代表遍佈內蒙，一方面從事偵察地形和資源等事，另一方面則盡量從事挑撥鼓動的工作，使蒙古大小王公分化，對於中央日漸疏遠，造成所謂內蒙明朗化的局面。這種特務代表裏面以前駐百靈廟的特務機關長盛島博士兼少將銜的一位最著名，手段也最毒，他是位蒙古通，說得一口道地的蒙古話，某方的侵略陰謀，可以說是完全由他計劃實施。他現在已經五十五歲了，流浪蒙古近三十餘年，最初他在庫倫，後來輾轉到內蒙各地，他做過喇嘛，熟悉喇嘛經文，現在娶了一位蒙古妻子，一切生活都是蒙古化了。他的身材很瘦小，鬚鬚留得很長，喜歡飲酒，說笑話，表面上眞是和藹可親，幾十年來在蒙古吃盡許多艱苦，皮膚也作赭紅色，身體却十分結實。蒙古人是喜歡得些小便宜的，他就利用這點拚命的化小錢，所以一般的蒙人都與他有好感。他在百靈廟開了一所善鄰學校，免費收蒙古小學生，第一目的便是灌輸他親日觀念，裏面蒙文和日文並重，漢文却一概刪除，現在察北處是是這樣的敎育機關，同時他在百靈廟還設了一所騎兵軍官學校，和善鄰醫院。蒙古人很不講究衛生，所以疾病疫癘很多，向來有病就請喇嘛誦經，結果是死的多，活的少，現在有了醫院，免費診治，當然感激了不得，一般蒙人的心理就逐漸變成日人為可親，華人為可怕，這種陰謀手段實在厲害。善鄰的意思與通行的親善提携有同樣的妙用，所謂笑裏藏刀，這樣的親善提携，眞是可怕。但是我們要反問自己為什麼蒙漢旣是一家，蒙人對於我們還存着可怕的心理呢？此點不設法根除，蒙古問題便永遠不得解决。“從可怕轉為可親，必待政府與民衆協力去做，更盼望邊省當局特別能注意及此！</p>

<h3>上海節之意義</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>幾經籌備討論之上海節。始於昨日草創成立。予全市民衆以公開之認識。長官倡導於上。士庶鼓舞於下。推陳出新。襄茲盛舉。情况熱烈。足資矜異。蓋自國難以來。人民陷於水火。逋毒方深。釋憂無術。長在愁苦前迫之中。寖成頹唐委靡之象。故賢有司必欲別圖振奮之道。藉寓策勵之意。際此春光駘蕩之長。原為人生行樂之日。以紀念形式。謀旦夕之歡騰。作其朝氣。使具發皇。用意所在。良有深致。唯上海節名稱。於茲猶屬創聞。蚩蚩者氓。容有未稔。輒循當局之意旨。略盡闡揚之責任。</p>
<p>上海節之所以規定於三月二十一日舉行者。以是日為國民革命軍底定上海之日。亦上海市民擺脫軍閥羈絆之日也。爾日以前。人無生趣。憔悴虐政之下。備受陵迫之苦。吮吸脂膏。鉅細靡遺。錮蔽思想。偶語有禁。而大刀隊之橫行。恣殺戮於市朝。尤使良愿惴惴。不知自保。爾日以後。民獲昭蘇。宛如㧞身泥塗。重享裀憑之樂。呼吸於自由空氣之中。超軼乎威逼朘削之外。昔時苛擾。於焉悉除。則此日之足垂紀念。固市民一致之要求。關於上海節之意義。此其一。</p>
<p>上海為國內唯一之都市。四方賓萌之所託足。人物殷庶。業務鞅掌。顧以份子複雜之故。轉威散漫不易團結。農也。工也。商也。學也。軍警官吏也。平日各就本位而履事。尠獲聚首一堂之機會。遂至意見不易溝通。識局各拘一隅。有敬業之意。失樂羣之旨。今於規定之一日。舉行盛大之集合。俾得共同參加。共同娛樂。以明親愛團結之精神。以示互助合作之必要。至迎神賽會。原屬迷信之舉。唯積習所沿。未易猝改。且農民以此為紓勞尋樂之出路。稗販以此為脫貨求售之利藪。强予禁絕。轉滋糾紛。今能因勢善導。使就範疇。汰神權之觀念。保實際之意味。保生產之向上。增市面之繁榮。改革習俗。一轉移事。關於上海節之意義。此其二。</p>
<p>上述意義旣明。當局提倡之苦心。自極為吾人所贊佩。甚願地方黨政賢俊。均能曲體斯意。善與人同。約束部屬。扶植民志。勿憑藉地位而濫用職權。勿矜持意氣而茹及良懦。以消除民間偶有之隔閡。以增進市政更遠之發展。以光大上海節無限之令譽而垂諸不朽。</p>
<h3>東京朝日新聞載日經濟考察團主要結論三點</h3>
<p>承認中日對立現狀不易打破　華北華中儘有經濟擴展餘地</p>
<p>［東京］日本赴華經濟考察團預定二十二日解散、東京朝日新聞今日復刋載上海專電、謂考察團等一行留華一週、已成立主要結論三點、卽㊀承認中日間對立之現狀、而於維持此種現狀之過程中、除將兩國間因偶發事件所引起之磨擦减至最底限度外、不能更有所行動、㊁中國業已完成現代國家組織之事寶、無可否認、故有予以協助以完成此項組織之必要、同時中國旣坦白表示日本協助之希望、故已留有日本在華更作經濟擴展之極大餘地、㊂然因英國已在揚子江流城一帶樹立堅固之經濟勢力、故日本舍在揚子江流域增加相互貨色之體積坐視毫無保障投資之活動外、別無他途可循耳、日本一方面雖限於保持日本在華中經濟勢力之現狀、但必以在華北之經濟擴展為施行日本對華全般經濟政策之根據云、（二十一日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日本决刷新外交機構</h3>
<p>佐藤考慮方案</p>
<p>［東京］最近議會之情勢、希望改革外交機構之聲浪頗高、昨日預算總會席上、民政黨之工藤鐵男與牧山耕藏亦要求實現此案、首相與外相均答以同感、並約定着手實行改革行政機構及錄用外界人材、故此事卽將具體化、而此次改革外交機構、其規模較大最近當由外相提出參考方案、聞佐藤外相擬乘此機會、以實行相當之刷新云、（二十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日貴院準備承認預算原案</h3>
<p>議會期或將廷長</p>
<p>［東京］貴族院審議預算、其經過頗形順暢、大約可於廿二日結束質疑、移歸分科會辦理、現因會期切迫、屆時當由林委員長發表向政府奏請延長會期之內意、然後决定大致方針、至各派對豫算案之態度、當俟移歸分科會以後分別協議、至最後之預算大會方可决定、大致意向認為此次豫算實為空前之鉅額、且偏重軍費、當係跛行的豫算、但鑑於內外情勢使之成立、實出不已、而年度內不得使用之陸海軍豫算、分別將二千二百萬元算入本豫算中、在憲法上不無疑慮、似欠妥當、故今後編制豫算、不得引為前例、須促政府注意、此項意見頗盛、故應依照此意附加嚴重之附帶决議、然後照原案承認云、（廿一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］本屆議會僅餘會期五天、政府與議員均對於延長會期之問題、認為非具體考究不可、今日適為祭日、實際上之審議日數僅餘四天、故更形切迫、政府對於日數之决定、正在苦慮之中、政府方面、現在期待廿二日貴族院預算委員長之表示、以便决定、是以屆時林首相與林委員長之會見、大致當可决定云、（廿一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本謀發展航空事業</h3>

<p>該項機關為促進飛機之性能計、將行使綜合的研究與實騐、又如養成航空技術員•製造民間飛機、均為其主要目標、設立與搆成等件大致如左、</p>
<p>㊀新機關當另行設立於現有航空研究各機關以外、將航空之基礎學理進而移至實際製造過程之重要部分、如航空器材•特殊飛機•發動機•燃料•航空氣象•航空醫學均須根本研究與實騐、並行製造上之指導、㊁設備特殊之大風洞•大實騐水槽•及其他對於航空研究與實騐必須之各種設備云、（二十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日人自造巨型機完工</h3>

<p>㊀設立海外貿易斡旋所、㊁派遣貿易事務練習生、㊂調查海外商家之信用、為辦理上項緊急業務起見、現正着手準備、而其最堪注目者、卽為設立貿易斡旋所、蓋商工省所經營之海外商品館、此後當撤銷、全部移歸中央輸出公會辦理、如日本產業協會之卡爾各答商品館與南洋協會之斯拉伐亞商品陳列所、又如日上貿易協會之伊斯丹堡商品錧、均將移歸該公會經營、又該公會將乘此機會、並不固定設立商品錧於一定之都市、以一年或二年之期限使之移駐於主要都市、改稱為貿易斡旋所、以便積極開拓市塲、而使之活躍於前綫云、（二十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日現金第三批卽將運美</h3>

<p>［東京］政府預定發運現金赴美、其欵額為五千萬元、第一次業經運出約一千七百五十萬元、第二次約一干六百七十萬元、合計約達三千四百二十萬元、第一次運現、最近擬以一千五百八十萬元、其運送船雖未决定、大致似可由大洋丸（二十三日由神戶起航）或來月六日由神戶起航之秩父丸担任運輸、政府之發運現金赴美、俟第三次起運後、當吿一段落、關於此後之情形、須暫時待機云、（二十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>菲列賓獨立問題</h3>
<p>美國會議員意見　謂不宜操之過急</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國會方面對於菲列賓總統奎松提早菲島獨立之建議、似多表同情、惟領袖議員亦稱如操之過急）、或將有害於菲島、參議員奈氏謂、菲島之獨立固愈早愈佳、然國會應俟專家委員會提出報吿之後、始能有所舉動、菲島旣經獨立、其農產品亦卽應與他國之貨品同等待遇、且美國亦不宜在菲島設立强大之海軍根據地云、參議員華爾許亦謂菲島之獨立、對於美國之海軍地位究竟有何影響、亦應加以研究、參議員波拉則謂彼誠恐菲島於一九八三年或一九三九年卽吿獨立、或將不能應付經濟上及財政上之困難、故彼以為奎氏之提議為不當云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>中法越南商約批准後我對越南貿易增進</h3>
<p>去年較前增起七成　輸出以生絲為大宗</p>
<p>▲越南河內通信　中法兩國間關於越南通商條約、前於一九三五年由雙方正式批準之後、中國對越南輸出數額、卽有顯著之增進、就去年而論、中國貨物輸往越南之價值、較諸前年增加百分之七十五、查前年中國貨物銷售越南之總值、為華幣五•六四三•〇〇〇元、至去年乃增至九•八九一•〇〇〇元、輸出品中、生絲佔半數以上、前年生絲輸往越南計值二•五九八•〇〇〇元、而至去年則增至五•二八五•〇〇〇元、換言之、卽增多百分之一〇三是也、按一九三六年向中國購買生絲之國家、以美國佔首位、法國次之、而越南則居第三、法國共向中國購入生絲值八•七九〇•〇〇〇元、越南所購入之數則為五．二八五·〇〇〇元、兩數合計共達一千四百萬元之多、而去年美國向中國購入之生絲、則總值僅一千一百萬元、可見法國本部興其亞洲殖民地、實為中國生絲之最大主顧也、至就本年而論、中國與越南間之貿易當更有改善之望、良以越南自過去一年以來、經濟已見復興、人民購買力為之增加、因此購買中國貨物自必較前有增無减云、（中央社三月二十一日哈瓦斯通信）</p>

<p>這不能確定的世界職業與業餘的公開網球錦標賽，不知能否於陽近的將來舉行，下面的等級包括職業同業餘的網球家，以他們去年的成績而評定的。</p>
<p>大多數的專家承認梵恩斯是今日世界上最優美的球員，潘萊是個最接近的第二位。梵恩斯在業餘家的時候，已保有種顯然超過潘萊的技藝，沒有理由可相信，他同像鐵爾登這樣的選手比賽，所得的經騐，能使他的競賽乏味。</p>
<p>因他在台維斯杯賽中的優美的成績，同他在惠勃爾登比賽中獲得决賽權，克拉姆應列第三。另德人納斯林Hans　Neuss　ein是最無名　估價太低的球員之一，列第四，他曾屢次使鐵爾登難以招架，鐵氏自己就可以作證。去年七月在英國南港，納斯林曾以直落三擊貶柯顯，而得這比賽之錦標。這比賽中包括有特出的職業家、只除掉梵恩斯不在內。勃琪名列第五，因他在國內同國外有優美的競賽成績，在全國錦標賽中，他幾乎打敗潘萊，在他們最後一次比賽中，於潘萊成為職業家之前，勃琪是戰勝潘萊的。</p>
<p>把鐵爾登列第六名，是自己情願聽很多的批評。鐵爾登在他最盛　時候，表演世界上面所未見的最優美的網球技術，今日在一種偶然的比賽中，也能打敗梵思斯。可是雖然這老手的射擊是充分高妙，而他的腿同他的精力，在一種五盤比賽中是不夠用的了。</p>
<p>奧斯丁列第七，除他於台维斯杯却令治賽中，放於奎斯脫外，他曾有一種稀有的台維斯杯的紀錄很夠列名於他的戰勝者之上。奎斯脫是澳洲的錦標，貼近奧斯丁，上季他屢次打敗他的同伴克勞福，他的技擊，是時常在改進中。他在惠勃爾登作實際决賽時，曾以十一比九擊敗亞拉姆於第五盤中，而使澳洲獲得却令治賽權。</p>
<p>凑成這第一流的十人，克勞福第九，法國柯顯第十。有三個或四個特出的職業家，可以打敗勃琪，奧斯丁，克勞福或奎斯脫，可是這些球員（像柯士洛Karelozeluh　派拉　Martin　Pala　理查士Vinnie　Richard）在最近幾年中，沒有常常參加重要的比賽，每個著名的球員所必須應該參加的競賽，（轉載競樂畫報）</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席潘局長致開會詞、略謂、今天是上海市市長照市參議會的建議、經愼重討論而决定每年三月二十一日有上海節、其意義就是希望在這一天、無分職業、不論區域、凡是上海市的市民、大家來表現團結合作互助的熱烈精神、同時假此節日、以勸工勸農勸商勸學、如舉辦農產品、手工業、園藝·勢作·反其他各種展覽會等、市長的意思、要在此節日、提倡改良風俗、因社會的移風易俗是很重要的、要有新的國家、必先有新的社會、要有好的政治、亦必先有好的社會、故改革社會風俗、是重要工作、一方面要把不良的違背時代的淘汰、同時一定要想出新的合乎時代的來代替、形式方面、予以改革、精神方面、予以凈化、如此、卽可達移風易俗之目的、如上海的迎神賽會、這是迷信的、含有封建色彩的、不應在現代舉行、但過去當農業經濟時代、農民在歲功吿成之後、想到謝神、同時在一年辛苦之餘、想到找一天快樂、於是有迎神賽會之事、所以在當時也有相當意義、市長的意思、要把此種賽會、一律禁止、而在上海節這一天、大家做有意義的賽會、蓋賽會不一定要迎神、如國貨遊行、以及蘇聯的體育遊行、一樣可以比賽、所以要把好的對於智識·體力·工農商業能鼓勵進步的、想方法來在上海節舉行、一天不及、甚至一星期也可以、但今年因籌備不及、故可作為宣傳年、使市民大家知道、到明年就熱鬧了、今天舉行的勞作展覽會、卽市長所希望於上海節舉行各種展覽會中之一種、如因籌備不及、當然不能與理想的相符、總計自十六日開始籌備、通知各校、參加者計市立中學師範五校、市立小學三十六校、私立中學師範四校、私立小學八校、職業學校未參加、故共五十三校、出品伴數、市立中學師範二四零七件、市立小學八三零四件、私立中學師範七三四件、私立小學一二八七件、共計一二七三二件、陳列順序、先小學、次中學師範、計市立小學十室、私立小學一大室、市立中學師範四室、私立中學師範二室、共計陳列十九室、最後、要各位注意、敎育方面的展覽會、為什麼先舉行勞作、因為我們現在感覺到敎育一定要與生活相符、希望各校所施的、學生所受的敎育、一定要與他將來實際生活需要的技能、獲得本來生活的技能、如智識體力都重要、但特別重要的是勞作、勞作是生活的必要條件、前幾年我們聽到過、“不勞働者不得食”一句話、其意義卽是要生活須先勞働、這理論是從外國來的、中國有“勞心者治人、勞力者治於人”、這觀念傳下來、以為不一定要勞力、但民間有一種口語、無論農工手藝、出去工作、說做生活、可以證明、生活要勞働、中國也是一樣的、所謂工作卽勞働工作、簡稱之為勞作、所以勞作卽生活、生活卽努作、故首先舉辦勞作展覽會、卽是要檢查學生除書本智識外、有沒有學到生活技能、如有．才是合乎現代需要的敎育、我們現在重視勞作、卽是要把科舉時代、只重書本智識的思想、轉變過來、故在上海節開始的第一年、舉行此會、要指示一般社會、知道敎育的新的意義、各位參觀後、要如何勉勵督促、以求進步、才不失舉辦之意義云</p>

<h3>工部局函復地產公會述自來水加價經過</h3>
<p>根據公司請求屢加考慮决定　地產公會日內開會繼續反對</p>
<p>新新社云、本市地產業同業公會、前曾致函公共租界工部局詢問自來水加價理由、昨接該局復函云、逕啟者、接准本月十七日大函、為自來水加價問題、敝局與自來水公司數度研究、屢加考慮、經敝局公用委員會提出討論、議决施行、其加價經過、原因如下、公共租界內之</p>
<p>自來水價</p>
<p>照前七五折計算、本局之公用委員會、近將此項减折問題、提出考慮、查七五折之辦法、係自一九三五年四月起施行、至是年底時、本局與自來水公司、均以地方經濟凋敝、認為水價不宜增加、公司並擬請將修改水價之舉、暫緩一年、俟中國政府所頒幣制辦法成效能較為顯著時、再行核奪、因此一九三六年之水價、仍與一九三五年相同、惟當時曾彼此諒解、謂如至按照情形確須將七五折收費之辦法酌改時、當由本局與公司商改、將近一九三六年底時、公司向本局呈請將水價改為八五折計算、當由本公用委員會與本局於</p>
<p>詳加考慮</p>
<p>之後、今公司將一九三七年度預算支出之詳情開報、公司旋於上年十二月二十九日申復、內稱公司之各董事、深信開支倘經减少、勢必於水料供給之繼續及安全、有不克維持之危險、並言、公司前經聲明謂有為數額頗多之地方、曾因在水給方面節省之、常發生流行症、以致喪失生命、並發生火災、以致損失財產、本年一月十一日、公用委員會開會時、復將此次討論、並有財務處處長建議、將公司擬定八五折改為八折、該處長以為倘改為八折之後、公司營業仍見虧負、應由公司公積金內撥支彌補、公司之總工程師兼總理畢爾遜君、曾列席會議、並答復關於</p>
<p>公司開支</p>
<p>之問題、畢君言、預算支出增加之主要原因、在於匯價之比一九三五年為低、以及新近裝設大批水表、且本年又須添裝一種新機、某委員言、界內用戶、現時所付之平均水價、比上海市或法租界為低、畢君言、倘照八折計算、公共租界之水價、殆與華界相同、但仍此法租界大為低廉、末後、畢爾遜君聲稱、最好在本年底以前、將水價修正、因上海房產業主公會、曾力請公司為華式房屋個別裝置水表、此是使用水减少、而就所經使用之水、而其每一單位之出水成本、則將增加、且公司尚須另行支出裝用水表之費、所以用戶所付水價、難免增加若干、現如商定水價改作八五折計算、將來或可不再加、惟此於將來之用戶為有利、並於現時之用戶、不免有所虧損、案經討論後公用委員會向</p>
<p>董會建議</p>
<p>如左、㊀請准上海自來水公司自本年二月一日起、將按照水表紀錄所開各用戶之賬單、自七五折改作八折收費、公司方面担承當在可能範圍之內、力求撙節、㊁情勢變更、而應將折减率修改時、得以本局之同意、酌加修改、㊂－九三一年至一九三七年間之公司開支、曾經激增、本局有見及此未能准公司所擬改為八五折計算、㊃將來裝置水表問題、應由本局有關係各處協同公司職員、詳加研究、公用委員會之前項建議、經董事會於本年一月二十日開會時核准、公司亦表示同意</p>
<p>開會反對</p>
<p>地產業同業公會接工部局復函後、以際此市面尚未恢復之時、自來水公司所提加價理由、以及公用委員會向董事會所建議各點理由、殊欠充足、現决定继續反對、定日內召開會議、讨論進行步驟云、</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>近代政治演變原因。</p>
<p>近代政治演變有三個主要原因：</p>
<p>㊀措置緊急的專變——內憂——階級鬥爭；外患！—民族斗爭。</p>
<p>㊁提高工作的效能—（一）責任加專，（二）計劃加詳，（三）經騐加多，（四）技衛加精，（五）時間加快。</p>
<p>㊂除去牽制的弊害——力量分散——力量對銷——力量防制。</p>
<p>這三個是主要的原因，其他原因尚多，現在就此三個主要原因分別說明：</p>
<p>在最近的各個國家，所處的境過與從前是大不相同了。任何國家均時有內憂外患發生，因為現在的所謂階級鬥爭就是內憂所謂民族鬥爭就是外患。這兩種形式就形成今天各個國家緊急的事變，所以，要有緊急措置。過去民主國家的規定是：緊緊急專變發生時，由團會授權元首；但是今天不可能了，因為今天的各方面，如外交軍事文化經濟，無時無刻不在鬥爭中，政治更不用說了。這樣隨時隨地都在鬥爭的狀態中，怎樣能夠隨時隨地來授權處理呢？所以各國了解此點，應該無時無地作鬥爭準備。有什麼法子，就是去掉過去議論多成功少的毛病，卽是授權於一黨，授權於一黨的一個領袖。這個原因是三個原因中最主要的，因為如果不能滿足措置緊急要求，國家危險，社會混亂，談不到其他一切了。（未完）</p>

<h3>新幣制策動的銀行農村投資</h3>
<p>— 慕傑</p>
<p>——廿五年度的總清算——</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>（二）投資的鳥瞰</p>
<p>（三）投資的統計</p>
<p>（四）活躍的原因</p>
<p>（五）投資的檢討</p>
<p>（六）結論</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>銀行業對於農村的投資，自從資金形成都市膨脹，農村枯竭的姿態之後，便藴藏着銀行資金灌溉農村的水流。當然，都市與農村的資金底分配失其平衡的結果，在都市中苦感現金的過多，銀拆跌落，投機盛行，而農村中有時却連一元現金都沒有。故銀行能使姿金迴歸到農村中去，實是診治農村衰落最嚴重病態——資金枯竭——的妙法。</p>
<p>但是銀行業的農村投資，究於何年始有顯著的軌迹可尋呢？試就最早投資農村的中國銀行與上海商業儲蓄銀行來看，則中國銀行大規模的農村放欵始於二十一年（註一）上海銀行的農業合作貸欵部成立於二十二年度（註二）。再就政府的措施來看，自二十二年四月成立的農村復興委員會函請上海金融界救濟農村後，一時投資農村的呼聲，風靡全國。故我們可說二十二年是銀行業正式與農村發生聯繫的一年，亦即是公開投資農村的一年。</p>
<p>從二十二年直到二十五年爲止，銀行業投資農村的歷史，已有四年了。它對於救濟農村方面究盡了什麽責任姑不問，就它在農村金融中所佔的地位來講，還是很低的。據實業部中央農業實騐所農情報告（二十三年十一月）銀行放欵平均佔農村借欵來源百分之二·四。當然，這並不足以説明現今銀行業農村投資在農村金融中所佔地位如何，但是還不能有一個重要的地位，却可以斷言。</p>
<p>但自從二十四年十一月三日推行新貨幣政策以來，我們了以很顯然看出政府欲利用之爲復興農村的原動力。政府不單給予中國農民銀行一寓萬元鈔劵發行的權利與五千萬元應辦農業放欵的義務，對於商業銀行亦極力鼓勵去投資農村，而農本局的合放資金亦是由各銀行分認的。故自二十五年起，銀行業的農村投資，因法幣政策的刺激而將佔農村金融中的重耍地位亦毫無疑義可以預言的。</p>
<p>因為上述政府法幣政策的推動，二十五年的銀行業農村投資，頗是活躍。而二十五年又屬豐收之年，各省農倉紛紛興建，更須銀行業的投資，較之以往數年情形，當然要有飛躍的進步。我們就法幣旅行後第一年——二十五年的銀行業農村投資情形加以考察便知道了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>關於投資的實在情况，凡稍留心報章雜誌的便知記不勝記，論區域除去過於偏僻的邊疆省份之外，那一省沒有銀行資金的灌溉！論從事的銀行，除專營農業的不計外，那一家商，工，專業，儲蓄銀行不至少總有一些！</p>
<p>我們首先看中國農民銀行。自新貨幣政策實行後，該行由財部特准發行流通劵一萬萬元，以半數辦理農貸。農貸的內涵：一是貸欵的種類分土地抵押放欵和農村放欵；前者要以農村土地爲原則，因改良土壤和整理農地的貸放亦包含在內；後者要特别注意於自耕農的救濟，和組織健全的合作社來投放資金。二是辦理農業放欵應在交通便利的地方設立農業倉庫以便農產品的運銷。三是提倡農業票據以流通農民資金。放欵的實際情形，據二十五年八月下旬該行發表的放欵數額總計一一·六八○千元，內合作社放欵共計七，二八二千元，動產押欵共計一，七二八千元，農倉放欵共計二，二九三千元，特别放款共計三七七千元。在十二月中的消息，則該行農村合作貸欵幾近八千萬了。</p>
<p>中國銀行的農村投資已有五年的歷史，廿四年的農村放欵金額約占各項放欵百分之六。廿五年的情形簡單地說有河南省推廣美棉種子投資五十萬元，在江西省舉辦生産貸欵，在安徽省辦茶棉米麥諸農産品之産銷貸欵，在湖南省舉辦五十萬元農村貸欵，在浙江省則有春耕烘繭放欵十萬元和農村倉庫投資額定一千萬的計劃。中行雖是國家特許的國際匯兑銀行，但他的商業性十分濃厚，故以之為商業銀行的代表。</p>
<p>由上面的記述，已可窺知廿五年的投資狀態，其他的情形在下一章內亦有綜合的介紹，兹從略。現在再記述二件有組織有計劃的投資情形。</p>
<p>因為農村經費日就衰落，各銀行的農村投資非但是杯水車薪，無濟於事，且各行多單獨活動，沒有一個有整個組織的機關在通盤計劃之下去從事，結果對於農村仍没有多大的裨益。故政府為達到新幣制標的之一（救濟農村）起見，特再由實業部聯合各銀行設立農本局，以救流通農業基金，調整農産品，籍以發展農村。農本局的資金分固定·合放·流動三種，除固定資金三千萬由政府擔任外，合放資金三千萬和無定額的流動資金則統由銀行分認。合放資金分五年繳足廿五年應繳六百萬元由三十家銀行，儲蓄會，信託公司分擔，其分配的情形：五萬以下者十二家，五寓元至十萬元者四家，十萬元至五十萬元者九家，五十萬元以上者五家。詳數如下（單位萬元）：</p>
<p>江浙春期收繭敗欵銀團的貸放，雖説借欵人是廠商，但直接還是裨益繭農，對於農村金融確有調劑的功能，當然亦是農村投資之一。各銀行對春期收繭的放欵，以往是各個銀行單獨地進行，二十五年則成立一個有組織有計劃的銀團來辦這件事。參加的銀行有中交等上海主要銀行十九家和福源錢莊一家。放欵金額原定三千萬元，結果放出約一千三百萬元，江蘇省佔十分之八，浙江省佔十分之二。浙江則因該省蠶絲統制會另向中交借欵五百萬元收買餘繭，故數額甚小。</p>
<p>總之，二十五年銀行業農村投資底活躍，已無庸置疑，前面活躍的一語已有這很好的事實來作它的報據。現在爲表示上述的更有根據起見，再就投資情形於可能範圍下加以統計的整理。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>要將銀行業投資農村的情形，想以統計的方法來整理，使成一有系統的姿態，實在是很難的。第一，本文所根據的資料大部爲平日報紙所記載，但是同一事項前後竟大有出入，且各報有時也互異其辭，有種消息很難判其實情如何。第二，本文所根據的報紙，僅上海一地，資料决不十分豐富，加以不能採用的又抬棄不取。故僅能簡單地整理分析如下：</p>
<p>首先，關於投資種類與區域的分析，這「種類」很值得研究。第一，如以農民從耕耘收穫到銷售的過程講，則有青苗·儲押·運銷放欵；如以投資的對象講，則有主要農產品和副業產品的放欵；如以承放的機關講，則有各種的合作社·農貸所·農業倉庫和農村委員會的放欵；如以投資標的的變現性講；則有動産和不動産的放欵；如以擔保品的有無講，則有抵押放欵與信用放欵。不過這並不是絕對的分類，某一種的放欵，可以有二個或三個以上的分類，如農業倉庫的農產品儲押放欵，既可視爲抵押放欵，亦可作爲農產品放欵，但又可當作動產放欵，或儲押放欵。第二，如果說農村投資分土地抵押放欵和農村貸欵（註三），那末現在土地抵押放欵銀行經營的很少，一切的貸欵統可歸入農村貸欵，實又太龐雜。下表的投資種類是就報紙所載的填入，並不完全依第一種方法去分類。</p>
<p>其次，關於投資數額，時期和利率等的統計，可以分爲二種形式，一種是時期和利率俱全的，一種僅有放欵的名稱和銀行，下表內％○是表月利率，％是表年利率。</p>
<p>從上面兩合計相加的結界，則廿五年的農村投資已有五千七百萬元，然這並不足以窺測廿五年的農村投資數額，現在我試爲估計一下</p>
<p>按照銀行年鑑（廿五年份）所載農業銀行的放欵，當首推中國農民為最多，次為蘇農民，其他農業銀行是佔極小的數額，兹略而不計。中農廿四年各項放欵爲二五，七八○千元，較廿三年約爲二倍，那沒廿五年亦算有二倍以內的增加，應爲五千萬元，但財部規定要以流通劵五千萬元辦農貸，故應有一萬萬元之數，（上文有放欵近八千萬一語）蘇農廿四年放欵爲一○、三五○千元，較廿三年增百分之三十，二十五年亦算增加三○％，應為一千三百五十萬元。各商業銀行的投資，就各行的報告書加以推算，廿三年爲五千萬元，廿四年爲六千五百萬元，廿四年較廿三年增三○％則廿五年應爲八千四百五十萬元，如此估計廿五年銀行業的農村投資應有一萬九千八百萬元。試再列表如下：（單位千元）</p>
<p>這數字的真實性，且留待事實的證明。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>無論從投資的鳥瞰和投資的統計來看，已足證明廿五年農村投資的活躍。現在分析它活躍的原因。</p>
<p>（一）銀行業對於農村投資，前數年不過是擴展業務，解决資金出路的一種計劃，完全是帶有冒險性底試辦業務。但出乎意料之外，放出的欵項差不多能全數收回，僅有小部份展期，并且放欵利息規定月利率一分，還可視各地情形而定（見上海銀行農業放欵章程）。利益固比不上投機的豐厚易得，比一般投資總相當的優越，而安全程度又甚高。故以前是一二家銀行經營，至此其他各銀行亦紛起投資農村以爲擴充業務，解决資金出路，獲得利益的方法了。何况更能博得依照政府法令，贊助政府救濟農村的美名呢！</p>
<p>（二）廿三年政府公佈的儲蓄銀行法內第七、八兩條規定儲蓄銀行對於農村合作社的質押放欵和以農産品爲質的放欵，不得少於存欵總額五分之一。現在專營儲蓄業務的銀行甚少，但各重要商業銀行均設有儲蓄部，依照該法的解釋亦視爲儲蓄銀行。故儘管各銀行設立儲蓄部的原意，並非因儲蓄銀行的性質是適宜於投資農村，各行爲法令的拘束却不得不經營之了。銀行業在爲自身利害打算兼求符合法令而投資農村，未始非法令的啟示；而廿五年投資的活躍除其他原因外，未始非法令的效果。</p>
<p>（三）近年來各地農倉的建設，亦為政府救濟農村的一端。在廿五年創辦農倉的趨勢，真是風起雲湧。一方面因是救濟農村要着之一，一方面因銀行農業的農村投資辦理得成績優良而樂於投資、建設的資金來源不十分難。故紛紛設立。加以廿五年又屬豐收之年，在預防穀賤傷農的口號下，農倉的建造，尤為必要，因而資金的需求愈殷。——農倉設立固有其本身的原因，但銀行業樂於投資之促進興建，和農倉創設之促進銀行業的投資，至少有點相關的。——故亦爲廿五年銀行業農村投資活躍的一要素。</p>
<p>這是就銀行投資的成績，法令的規定和農倉的建築而言。若再就新貨幣政策實施後的影響底刺激與其他原因而論，則：</p>
<p>很明的，政府新貨幣政策是給予相當的影響。因爲從廿四年十一月三日政府施行的新貨幣制度，規定中央·中國·交通三家國家特許銀行的兑換劵爲法幣集中發行後，以前有發行兑換劵權利的各銀行底發行兑換劵利益是被剝奪了。此其一。</p>
<p>新貨幣政策不單剝奪了商業銀行底發行兌換劵利益，它所賦與中，中，交三行無限制賣買外滙權後，各商業銀行的外滙業務，當然受了很大的打擊。更因三行無限制賣買外滙的原因，外滙的投機，無形中是被取締了。此其二。</p>
<p>繼這種大改革之後，廿五年二月份政府又以統一公債換償舊有債劵，以復興公債一部份作平衡債市的基金。於是這傾刻之間可獲大利的投機勾當，一向是各銀行主要的業務，因換償之後，市價穩定，難以投機。故無論從資金運用方面講，或利益獲得方面講，總是受最大的損失。此其三。</p>
<p>專就投機方面講，不但公債外滙不能投機，這有世界最大投機的稱謂的上海標金，亦因新幣值與銀價隔離而不發生繫聯的原因，標金的投機亦無形中被取締了。加以因受經濟恐慌所襲擊的地產事業，雖然在新貨幣政策中有不動産銀行籌設的方針，可是地產依然呆滯，這一條投機的路又是不通。此其四。</p>
<p>此四原因，固難斷說有百分之幾或幾十是促成銀行業的農村投資底挺進，然自業務範圍（指不正當的）逐漸狹隘，資金運用困難，利益來源斷絕這方面講，為擴展業務圍範，解决資金出路尋求利益源泉，上面四原因無疑地是廿五年銀行業農村投資活躍的因素。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>廿五年的銀行農村投資，不但是活躍而已，在放欵的方法上，爲求資金的安全起見，亦有很嚴密的規定。試就這一年中的情形加以檢討，則：</p>
<p>對於欵項的用途有精密的限制。如中國銀行與湘省建設廳訂的放欵辦法中。信用放欵的用途限於購買種籽·肥料·牲畜·其他經營農業的必需品，和用於運銷或精製的設備，及農業生産上所需的其他事物。</p>
<p>對於欵項的用途有恰當的分配。如中國農民閩省農倉放欵辦法中規定：倉庫房屋的建築或修繕，不得超過全部工料百分之六十；購置加工設備，不得超過全部費用百分之七十。又如交通的祁茶生産貸欵尤是精細；規定每箱精茶最多廿五元，第一期每箱預支五元，作爲預定茶工，購買柴炭箱料的用途，第二期八元到十二元作爲購辦採製茶葉工具等　的用途，第三期九元到十一元作為支付工資的用途。</p>
<p>就放欵的方式看，依現狀分析可分：一，與農村合作婑員會或建設廳合作，投資合作社，二，與地方政府或地方銀行合作，投資農業倉庫或農産品等，三，直接自辦或貸欵地方政府去辦。然爲求放欵的安全，二十五年更有加重合作機關責任的趨勢。如蘇農與建設廳商訂調整合作社放欵辦法十六條的要義是：合作社向該行借欵時，應經合作指導員的負責介紹，該行直接向合作社放欵，則於事後通知合作指導員；但合作指導員介紹農行放欵，事先應加以審核，並簽註意見，對於放欵的用途及安全應切實負責。</p>
<p>就各銀行在同一省份放欵的情形看，則有分區活動的趨勢。如安徽省特約各銀行農倉貸欵的原則中便規定中華銀團爲祁門鳳陽等二十四縣，中國銀行爲宣城當塗導十二縣，中國農民爲蕪湖合肥等十二縣。在浙江亦是分區的。</p>
<p>然而這種狀態，是銀行業本身投資方法的進步，對於農民究有多少實惠還很難説。銀行當局或許認爲盡善盡美，而農民方面對於這種限制或許認爲困苦。並且銀行的規定不還是爲着自己資金的安全而設置！銀行為投放資金的安全而有種種的限制，原無可非議，然在農民方面的感受，正不難想像。再就分區投資説。不還是爲避免彼此間的投資競爭（於富庶之區）而何！對於農民的裨益究在那裏呢？我們自放欵的利率看：</p>
<p>就前面的統計來講，則月利率最高為一分，最低為八厘，年利率最高為一分，最低為九厘。在銀行方面講，可說已經很低的了。然實際上農民所能享受的利率最低要月息一分二厘，最高要一分八厘，一分半更是普通的事。如交通祁茶貸欵暫行辦法有月利八厘和合作社轉貨給社員的利息最高不得超過原貸該社利息的四厘（即不得超過月息一分二厘）的規定。浙江地方銀行的零星動産押欵月息一分五厘（據該行報告謂包括保管等費）。閩農村合作委員會定的農村合作社兼營糧食抵押辦法中月息是一分七厘。皖中農行在蕪湖設立的農民抵押貸款所利息爲一分半，外加保管養三厘，合爲一分八厘。這分半分七的月利率我們僅能説較高利貸是低的，然若與上面統計最高月息一分最低年息九厘相較，不將視此爲高利貸嗎？</p>
<p>自農民所能受到銀行資金灌溉的利益而言，已如上述。現在再就投資的地域而論，則仍有集中蘇浙皖的形勢，次之魯豫陝，再次贛鄂湘等省。東南三省雖農村衰落之至，究是富庶之區，魯豫陝則年來棉產大增，無怪銀行資金的進攻哩！</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>總之，新貨幣政策實行後的銀行業農村投資，較之以往情形，二十五年當然是劃時代的一年，在商業銀行則因貨幣銀行制度的改進，不正當的業務逐漸在被取締或自動放棄，作正軌的擴展，以求自己根基的穩固，無疑，投資農村是目前正軌的擴展。在農民銀行則政府幣製政策的提携，五千萬元流通劵辦理土地押放和農業貸款，由農民銀行投資的過程上説，正是一個飛躍的進步。——如投資數額底分配，二十三年約佔百分之二十八，二十四年約佔百分之三十六，商業銀行是佔最大部份，而二十五年則已佔百分之五七（據前述估計）。</p>
<p>二十五年的情形如彼，二十六年試加以預測，則至少有常態的發展。如報載中交銀行將照去年所貸放的數目—中行八百萬元交行三百萬元—加倍放貸。但是放欵的利率和投資的區域，前者希望能再减低，對轉放機關的利率要有一個最高的限制；後者希望能向各省區平均地發展。</p>
<p>本文根據的資料不富，和作者的謭陋，第三節統計也許太簡，估計也許不確，第四節原因的分析也許不當，第五節投資的檢討亦僅就投資的本身上着論，統希讀者諒之</p>

<p>春天已來到了人間，可是戰地看不到甚麽春天。戰地黝黯的蒼穹，沒有照出暖和的陽光；戰地密結的層雲，沒有顯出明朗的晴空：戰地怒號的烈風，沒有帶點兒和煦的醉意；戰地百里的平沙，透不出嫩綠的新芽，更沒有開放着紅的桃花，飄摇着綠的楊柳；戰地祇聞號角的鳴聲，聽不見鶯歌和燕語；戰地的健兒整天伏在泥土的壕溝中，擊槍實彈，胼手胝足，沒有想到遊春與踏青；春天不到這邊塞的戰地中來，而他們要到那沒有春天的邊塞戰地中去，他們是不喜愛這美麗的春天嗎？是要捨棄這明媚的春天嗎？</p>
<p>不是，他們也一樣知道春天的可愛，不過他們覺得此時賞春尚非其時罷了，此時的春天還包含着許多痛史呢！請看：那些同胞有家歸不得！那些國土被人家搶去耕種！並且同胞們要是還不知振奮，儘管沉迷在春光的懷抱裏面，這大好的河山就將要完全斷送在敵人的手裏！所以戰地的健兒，他們才不惜血肉的身軀，和敵人拚命，為整個國家民族自由而犧牲。他們要從敵人的手裏，奪回我們自己的春天。</p>
<p>戰地看不到甚麽春天，春天祇深藏在戰士的心頭。</p>
<h3>湄公河畔的蠟虎</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>南洋的蠟虎，在當地一般獵者的眼光中，看來簡直把它當作獸中之寶一樣。往往得到了一頭蠟虎，可以在幾月中安逸地生活而不須山獵。這種蠟虎的出沒之處，大都是在湄公河畔北岸的亞萊書德地方。因為近年來獵者捕捉過勤的緣故，也已漸漸地稀少了。</p>
<p>蠟虎的形狀和老虎相似，不過身體略小一籌而已。在這裏有一種蠟樹，他們唯一的食料也就是以樹上的生蠟來果腹。因爲這樹有着三四丈高，當蠟虎爬上樹頭尋食的時候，偶一不慎，就會從高高的樹上直跌下來。很奇怪的是决不會因此而昏厥或受傷。一跌到地上，就失去知覺而酣睡過去。雖然在它身傍有着巨大的聲音，也决不會驚醒過來，約莫經過一小時以後’才能漸漸的蘇醒。獵者往往利用他酣睡的機會而毫不費力的加以捕捉，但也有在蠟樹底下苦守了多天而一無所獲的。那自然要看獵者的運氣了。</p>
<p>蠟虎身上最寳貴的東西，要算胆和皮了。這膽用藥水泡浸後，可治一切跌打損傷。在以前南洋一帶的醫生，往往不辭跋涉的到獵者家裏去收買，每隻膽的價值有多至三四百金的。就是當地獵者，偶然和野獸搏鬬而受到了創傷，用這胆水略加敷施，沒有不立可痊愈的。可惜近年獵者為利慾所薰，都用僞貨出售，銷路也漸漸地减少了。至於虎皮，拿來作成馬夾，貼身穿着，有槍彈不入之功。因此一張虎皮，也可買得百金左右呢！</p>
<h3>桃紅色信封</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>「桃紅色言封，」是一位女性的敝同事。雖然伊並不是專門造就交際明星的名校中的高材生，而且也並不具有着戴上甚麽皇后之冠的美麗，但伊也總是一位高中的畢業生，而且也還具有着少女所應具有的綫條與輪廓，所以當伊初來時，同事之中，頗有對之傾倒的，但終因伊的不苟言笑，冷若冰霜，而大家也都把一團高興，冷了下去。</p>
<p>這是一位年青的姑娘，是在三年之前，畢業而前來服務的。據説，還是一位没有對手的姑娘。但是很使我人驚異的，自從伊前來供職之後，除了星期日之外，在每天早上，由郵差送來的一大堆信件之中，總是雜有一封寄給這位姑娘的桃紅色信的。信面上，除了鋼筆寫的地址，及伊的姓名之外，只具着一個發信人的姓氏。但其筆力之雄偉，一望而知，出自男子的手筆。這封桃紅色信，有時，雖然早上沒來，可是在下午二點半準到。這麽着三四個月之後，大家都漸加以注意了。雖然任誰都沒有偷拆，而一窺秘密的勇氣，，但是這是包藏着蜜一般甜的情書，那是毫無疑義的，於是乎便有好事者，給這姑娘，起了一個別名，叫做「桃紅色信封」。在伊的背後，提起伊時，便大家一致的廢止了某小姐的稱謂，而呼之為桃紅色信封。</p>
<p>一年，二年，桃紅色信的傳遞，真可說得是未曾間斷過。雖然大家都沒曾知道過寄發桃紅色信的，究竟是誰，但大家對於這位寄發桃紅色信的，都具有着莫名的艷羨。而在星期假日，任誰逛公園，瞧電影，或上跳舞塲，都留心着，想發現伊的芳踪，而一窺這位桃紅色信封的情侶的廬山真面目，可是其結果，却一無所得，因此，桃紅色信封，遂成了同事中的一個神秘之謎。</p>
<p>可是僅僅在三個月之前，桃紅色信的寄遞，才只停止了半個月光景，桃紅色信封，忽然辭職了。大家以為伊的愛情，已經成熟，而將結婚了，不意在伊辭職之後一星期，忽然傳來了一個消息，說的這位姑娘，已在進行着一個桃色的訴訟。説的對方已向伊追求了三年情書已將到達一千之數，而且中間已發生了幾度的或種關係。結果，却發現了伊的情人，竟是一個有婦之夫，而且已是三個孩子的爸爸了。在訴訟中，伊更提出了迄今還是不足二十歳的證據</p>
<p>雖然這一個訟案，遷延了二個多月，終於在條件之下和解了，但是桃紅色信封，不知已褪色到了怎麽個程度了。</p>
<h3>鼠食貓羅</h3>
<p>— 懦俠</p>
<p>最近本報「國內要聞」裏面，刋着浙江臨安地方「鼠食貓」的一段新聞，煞是奇趣，筆者因此便聯想起以前廣州那裏，也發現過同樣的一回事。現在把它記出，凑凑熱鬧，事實上是這樣：</p>
<p>在廣州五仙洞地方，有一片雜貨店，隔兩三天，總是失掉了一綑鰌魚，店主初時當是夥計們偷去變賣，但是沒有證據，不便作聲，後來打了烊，他從樓上地板的空縫裏窺伺着，大家睡静了，忽然看見一隻像豬一般大的黑毛老鼠，跳上櫃檯，站起來，拖了掛着的一綑鰌魚便逃，經過好幾次的觀察，才知它是從灶披間的水坑走進來，巢穴是在附近一堵舊城牆下面的一個窟窿裏，店主沒法捉得到它，便出賞格，無論何人，把所養的貓帶來，倘使能够捕殺那鼠，就賞給他五十塊錢，並且願出二百元的代價，來收買他的貓，不多時，有個蛋户（就是住在水上的船家）領着一頭重約十三斤好像猛虎的雄貓來應徵，怎知那天晚上，偌大的貓，竟會被那鼠吃了半截，末後，一個農人把他養了廿多年重十九斤強的雌貓，從老家「中山縣」帶出來，可是相鬥之下，貓緊咬着鼠的喉嚨，鼠力壓住貓的身體，結果都喪了命，這事曾經傳遍全市。那時有人將死去的大鼠用秤來稱，重量足有三十七斤，在它躱藏的窟窿裏，還檢出無數吃賸的鰌魚。</p>

<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>櫻花和日本</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>櫻花是日本的國花，在四月中盛開，一片絳霞，嬌艷異常。日本人都是愛之如命，凡是日人足跡所到之地，都有櫻花。其他徽章商標廣告裝飾圖案等，莫不以櫻花為之。櫻花從含苞初放到落英滿地為止，不足半月。台灣地近熱帶，開花最早，一月中已有櫻花，而日本北海道一帶要七八月裏，才有山櫻看見。所以英國有「國旗上没有一個時間，照不着太陽」的豪語，而日本有「一年之中沒有一季看不到櫻花」一語的。</p>
<p>據日本植物學者牧野博士考據，櫻花並不是日本獨有的，亞洲西南部也有分布着。希瑪拉雅山上的希瑪拉雅櫻花，也相當美麗的。還有朝鮮的濟州島，是一個小山，在十五年前，發現那裏也有東京染并櫻，所以説不定日本櫻花是從朝鮮輸入的。現在日本的櫻花原來都是野生的山櫻，是深紅色的單瓣。後來漸漸變種，成了重瓣雙瓣，顏色也淡得和水紅一樣了。</p>
<p>日本以為櫻花是象徵他們的武士，但是理由却誰都說不清的。到過日本的人，都認爲櫻花和日本女子很能調和，其妖艷輕蕩都含有極誘人的魔力。色香味三者之中，櫻花已缺其香，開得快落得快，恐怕比桃花還要薄命。在盛開時候的鮮艷茂盛，非其他花卉所及。而盛極一時之後，飄零便在目前的。</p>
<p>一年一度櫻花盛開，人携酒賞花，如顛如狂，極盡享樂之能事，外國人到日本來觀光的，也都在這個時期，所以下次世界運動會在日本舉行，會期一定是在四月中的。因為日本花木，只有櫻花楓葉松樹最多，觀楓看松的興趣，都沒有賞櫻花好。東京櫻花最盛的地方，是飛鳥山和小金井，其他各公園神社中都有。東京櫻花以染井吉野櫻爲最多。染井是東京郊外的地名，當德川時代，那裏都是花圃，但是現在毫無遺跡了。吉野是山名，至今還是櫻花的名勝。日本神武天皇之前，便愛櫻花，有名木花笑耶姬的，這「木花」兩字，恐怕就是指着櫻花的。</p>
<p>熱海的緋寒櫻，在一月中便開花，色甚濃，是由台灣移植來的。台灣以前是屬於我國的，而我國內地，没有聽見過櫻花。這是很奇怪的。我國的櫻桃，和櫻花很像，說不定是櫻花的一類，學植物學的，或者可以考查得出其變化的經過。我國東三省青島蘇州青陽地上海的虹口一帶，都種着無數美麗的櫻花，在盛開的時候，也有不少有閑者，夾在木屐羣裏徘徊欣賞着。而孤山上幾枝吃盡風霜的寒梅，還是等候着來年的探梅專車。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回（白版紅箋空還兩行淚荻花楓葉獨歩半城秋）</p>
<p>冷眼看熱衷的人，大概是越看越淸楚。反過來，熱衷的人要逃冷眼，也就越逃越顯得躊躇。這時，國器和朱小松對面默然的坐着，也就在臉上透着一點不自然出來。小松笑道：就詩的字句裏面去揣測着，我是覺得我的話，不會錯的。就算是錯了吧？我問你這幾首詩要插在小説裏，小説是怎樣的佈局？國器道：你在詩裏面可以看得出來的，何必再問我？小松見他不露一點口風，這就捧了那張詩稿在手，又細聲念了一遍，因道：我猜是這樣吧？有一位青年，偶然碰到一位少女，就鐘下情了。於是自那天起，每天就要等那位少女過去，無論怎樣的忙，也忘不了這件事。但是那位少女並不把這少年放在眼裏，由春天到秋天，無論這少年怎樣的注意他，他絲毫不睬。而且這位少女有些發脾氣了，所以……國器採着手，立刻攝住他道：不對不對。若是那個女人生氣，這男人還要去看（我那等於無賴的行為。這兩個人雖然不認識，但却是女子仰慕男子的文名在先。小松道？據詩上看去，分明兩個人不曾通言。那女子何以知道所遇到的男子，就是他心裏所仰慕的那個人呢？國器道：那是由於通信所得知的。小松的臉上一點也不帶笑容，眼光還是注視望那詩稿上，跟着很隨便的問道？這却不知道是男方先向女方通信呢？還是女方先向男方通信呢？（一四七）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>放風箏與踢毽子</h3>
<p>— 羅才淸</p>
<p>讀到提倡放風箏踢毽子比賽的消息，我不禁回想起寶貴的童年時代了。在鄉下，那是春天和冬天兩種最適宜的運動。（毋寧說是遊戲吧）春天，農忙還沒有開始，集合了許多孩子，大人們有時也很高興來參加，到高丘上競放風箏，一片呼聲時常會掩過布榖鳥的“家家布榖”冬天，剛割過稻後，農塲上一片太陽，什麼人家為了祭祖，宰隻鷄來的金鷄毛，就被孩子們搶來做毽子，於是大人們在太陽底下談着今年收成的時候，孩子們又是為毽子而高興着。</p>
<p>那種情況似乎過去得很遠了，並從鄉下逃到上海的生活圈中，一切所目擊的都是令人掃興的事：卽使放風箏與踢毽子吧，住在租界上的孩子們（自然又是一代了就沒有那種福分，因為租界上有“電綫”，放風箏就被干禁了：偶或也有些孩子們，依舊買了個小小的風箏在僻靜的馬路上放逐，可是可愛的春風都被高房子的屋頂打住了，風箏祇在他們手里抖了二抖，就打在陰溝里了，不是粉身碎骨，也便是百孔千瘡。於其把討來的糖菓錢買個空，還是到弄口糖攤去打“狸貓換太子”。</p>
<p>跟毽子似乎沒有干禁過，但是引誘上海底孩子們的遊戲太多，打“狸貓換太子”卽是一例。而且那些高尚的弄堂里，（大都是稱做“邨”，或“別墅”了）有的是橡皮輪汽車和跑冰鞋，毽子這種玩意兒已經淘汰得太遠了。</p>
<p>不過大人踢毽子上海倒是有的，他在遊藝塲里賣藝，把一個毽子踢出許多花樣來，博取花錢老倌們的歡心。他常常在台上踢得滿頭大汗，而台下高喊着“再來一個”的時候，他又不得不“再來一個”的。這，似乎又離了“運動”的本旨了。</p>
<p>這是其一，上海人又彷彿從來不注重運動似的，到公園里去散散步，也得化一塊錢買一張呌做“派司”的入塲證。他們都是聽着工廠里的汽笛，或者家里的鬧鐘！那是自己在睡覺的時候開上了要醒來的時間的！他們祇記着“怎樣工作”和“多少酬報”，簡直也沒有多餘的時間來研究什麼運動了。</p>
<p>所以有過一個時候，我還想“回到農村去”，讓我再享受一點在租界上所剝奪了的自由吧。但是鄉下的孩子也變了，他們在我們放風箏與踢毽子時侯同那樣大小的年紀，也帮着父親上田工作，和我同年紀的同伴們們却在家里打老婆，好像他們都已變了一個人，再想不到那樣有趣的游戲！放風箏與踢毽子了。</p>
<p>現在又是春天了，多少人家又在籌備了“下種錢”來博今歲的希望，而上海呢？遊春專車的廣吿也早在報上見到了。</p>
<p>什麼時候再能見到風箏在天空中自由飛翔着呢？</p>
<h3>夜海上</h3>
<p>— 陸嘉</p>
<p>摇摇地，飄到深邃的夜海裏，小漁舟有黑色的帆，黑色的船舷，船尾坐在舵旁的漁婦有黑色的頭巾。</p>
<p>海是不甯靜的，即使有沉重的夜也壓不住牠的翻騰。浪挾着重量咆哮地衝擊脆弱的船舷。泡沫濺到船裏，濺到船頭上理網的老漁夫的身上。</p>
<p>冷——</p>
<p>冷的風，冷的水花穿透棉襖上的破洞。雖然風浪裏磨鍊岀的筋骨，也耐不住這刺穿皮肉的冷濕呵！</p>
<p>破網幾次從手頭滑落去，只因老漁夫的手凍僵了；浮在浪頂上的船身有高度的巔播，不容他立起戰慄的腿子，像往日一樣，堅定地。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>風鼓着帆，桅頂的一盞紅燈照不破海的秘密。</p>
<p>漁婦的身邊也有一盞摇曵的風燈，挣扎着風和浪裏的命運。在恐怖的怒海裏，燈子，老漁夫，漁婦和小舟作為相互的慰安和依伴。他們有着相同的命運。</p>
<p>漁婦矻然不動，風掀起她的頭巾在腦後翩翩飛舞。不管浪花跳上她的顔面，躍上她遮身的油布，她頑强地把握着舵柄。在僅可照淸她面龐的燈光下；一臉水珠，一臉堅忍和殉道者的莊嚴。牙齒緊咬着下唇，還咬着一縷額前墮下的髮絲。眼珠子化石似地凝視着船頭；船頭，老漁夫龍鍾的身影溶在潑墨的海與夜裏，要想用眼睛析取岀來是頗為困難的。</p>
<p>老漁夫仰首向天喃喃着，不知是咒咀還是祈禱。可是聲音爲風浪的嘷叫和海龍的咆哮壓沒了，而且天上封着濃厚的黑雲，沒有一個字能傳到神靈的耳朶裏。</p>
<p>突然慘綠的電閃像一支冷箭，又像一個寒噤穿破黑雲的積層，刺破海的幽暗的臉。光閃到峙嶇不平的海；海面波浪堆積如鉛塊，從船舷到無際。雷隆隆地滾過去。</p>
<p>人心上有為閃電引起的恐怖。漁婦看見這海顯現了幽暗的臉——那不可測的藏滿陰險的臉，彷彿就在船舷邊曾吞噬過自己的丈夫的大嘴又張開了，等候第二次的吞噬。</p>
<p>（不久以前，丈夫輕易地探測秋十月暴怒的海，而自己提着燈籠在海岸上等候，到天明，還不見丈夫回來的時候。）</p>
<p>（五歳的留兒在明矢醒來看不到爺爺和娘的時候。）</p>
<p>不敢讓思索的綫引下去，她喊：</p>
<p>「公公：還是回去吧！」</p>
<p>伴着一陣勁風一個蒼老的來。雖然固執着，可也鎮止住抖。</p>
<p>「你看，留兒的娘—是西風而且退潮，怎麽回去呢？」</p>
<p>「可是……」媳婦默住了，想想明天空空的鍋子，低下頭，熱淚和水珠混合在冰冷的頰上。</p>
<p>海風依然怒吼着，夜似乎更重了。</p>
<h3>美國內務部新厦落成</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>一切用「機器人」工作</p>
<p>美國內務部新造的大厦，現已落成，裏面設備着新時代種種精美的機械，可算得美國第一所別開生面的新建築。在數星期後，內務部長伊克斯氏跟他的屬員三千人遷入的時候，各種工作，差不多完全可由「機器人」代勞，除去關於用腦力的事。每個房間都有自動的空氣變化機關，陽光雖晒得滿滿地，空氣却比蔭處凉爽。一共有三十六個空氣變化區，都能自動節制。逢到冬季，空氣便變成暖潤，逢到夏季，空氣便變成凉爽。一分鐘要用水八千五百加侖替工作者把空氣洗淸。發生暖氣的總爐子，有自動啟閉的機關，因為用了「機器人」節制温度的方法，暖氣費用可以節省從百分之十五至百分之二十，但是逢到天氣在零度的時候，那爐子每小時仍然要燒煤三噸半之多。這所大厦底層的面積是一百十萬方呎，因爲裝置了許多防警機關，所以只用三十保衛士担任廵邏。屋內無論何處發生警變，便有「機器人」奔到那地點，發信號報告警衛總務處，足使底下令層都知道，倘若事勢重大，還會使本城消防處事道，而作戒備。「機器人」大都受熱氣運用，但也有不少接連很複雜的機械，能作種種靈巧的運用。目前其餘政府機關，只有一處，「機器人」造的更為巧妙，那便是新造的文書庫大厦，裏面的「機器人」是用「電目」運用，國家實貴的文書藏在這庫中，是萬無一失的。內務部新厦在第五第六層中間的半層，闢一「機器人」部，外觀好像醫院中的開刀室，裏面漆成白色。凡暖氣，電燈，電話，都分別裝在管內，外面毫無痕跡，電話利用最新的自動制。每種設備，首先注重便利，其次注重美觀。內部的構造，都豫先爲修理油漆打掃打算，以免臨時發生困難。正屋共有二千個房間，左右兩面，各有分屋六所，每個房間都朝向外面，空氣陽光，毫無缺憾，這所大厦共用去造費美金一千三百萬元。</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>天空是淡灰色的，從混雜着塵沙的空氣裏望上去，你像一塘潮濕的鹽粒。</p>
<p>我底心彷彿泡在這池鹽粒裏，有些發麻。頭混混沉沉的，不知道放在什麽地方好，在混沉的感覺裏，有時一陣疼痛，身上的筋肉就打着顫，向一塊兒縮。</p>
<p>真不放心。躺在床上，胡思亂想。是不是腦溢血呢？聽大人説，家裏好幾代人都是害這種病死的。不久以前，醫生還告訴過我，要注意這種病症。——我有些怕，心跳起來了。</p>
<p>幾個禮拜以來，時令就不正，頭一天很暖和，好像春天，第二天却冷得要命，加上幾件衣服還不能抵得過冷風。可是，別人説：腦溢血跟這種天氣並没大關係，那麽，是怎麽一回事呢？</p>
<p>街上很平静，人好像都給風刮跑了。</p>
<p>我跑到一位朋友家，他懂得一點點醫學常識的。或者能告訴些應當怎麽樣一類的話吧。</p>
<p>我告評他情况以後，他拉過我底手，看看舌頭，喉嚨，摸摸腦袋，很有醫生的派頭，是後，他仔細端詳我底手。</p>
<p>「恐怕是猩紅熱吧？」</p>
<p>説着，他指我底手背，那上面什麽時候，出現了很多小紅點兒我不知道，經他一說，我不由地蹙一蹙眉，注視着那是很小很小的點兒，幾個一組幾個一組地聚集着！好像正在開會，商議怎麽把我弄死。</p>
<p>一想：差不多！這幾天報上不是說醫院裏很多病腥紅熱的嗎？而且，還有很多死掉的。大概不會錯的。一定是！</p>
<p>我望着那些小紅點，心裏説不出來地發慌，假如可以的話，我想把手背咬破，把小紅點咬出來，然而，身上也有一些呢，可又怎麽辦？用刀子把皮膚都刮破嗎？</p>
<p>在朋友房裏來回地跨着大步子，好像舒服一些。</p>
<p>朋友呆呆地向我望，他那明亮的眼睛給灰色的網蒙住了，頭髮被他搔得悲傷地散亂着，活像一堆野地的枯草，灰敗得很。他把屁股靠向桌子沿，兩隻手順身子豎着，嘴巴不靈活地吵：</p>
<p>「我們怎麽能害病呢？——我們！」</p>
<h3>賽金花（七）</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>洪返國後越二年，患病死，賽脫離洪家屬，並立下苛刻條件：“以後須回南方，不得再到北方，以後不得向洪氏需索，以後不得用舊名作標榜”。賽在官勢壓迫下，祇得離京到滬。</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>

<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>“就是我們這種人才害病呢。”</p>
<p>我無可奈何地說。心裏比先前更難受，簡直不知道怎樣好。天空更加灰暗了，鹽粒緊緊地包圍住我底心。</p>
<p>兩個人都沒有辦法。</p>
<p>他吿訴我，還是快些到醫院去檢查，說不定會有辦法出來的，聽說上海有家醫院專門收容傳染病患者，只取一點醫藥費，看護還周到。</p>
<p>“那你快些去吧！——這是不好馬虎的！”說完，他少微停一下，兩隻手頹喪地摔了下兒，搖搖腦袋：“他媽媽的，今天是禮拜！”說着，身子好像要癱瘓了。用沒力的調子，帶着安慰的感情，說：“你只好先回去休息了，要好好地休息。”</p>
<p>在平常，他總是很安靜，穩重的，今天一切都失去平衡了。</p>
<p>我自己雖然盡力壓制自己底情感，低低地安慰自己，說：不會是猩紅熱的，也不會有危險的，然而，越是這末說，自己越害怕，越覺得那是自己騙自己。</p>
<p>天簡直被靈魂蓋住了，彷彿是一塊塊的石板拚凑起來的，重重地壓住大地，壓在我底胸上。</p>
<p>身上沉重得不願意移動一下。喉嚨裏發熱，又發癢。抬起兩隻手來看，紅點變得更大了，聚集得更密了，好像要衝破皮膚跳出來的樣子。</p>
<p>夜色漸漸濃了，我不想吃東西，也不能思索什麼，眼前頭現着一個卡通畫片似的字死它一會兒變得米粒那麼小，退隱下去了，可是一會兒又大了，大得掩沒了一切，字劃兒模糊了，變成漆黑的天空。</p>
<p>我望着窗外的天空，那就像“死”變得一樣黑暗月明，星光，都給他佔有，我就受着他底拂摸。</p>
<p>——呌我怎麼辦呢？呌我！</p>

<h3>話劇</h3>
<p>螢社劇團</p>
<p>交通（一三○○）下午五時至五時四十分</p>
<p>洋白糖</p>
<p>走私愈來愈猖狂了，江南的市鎭也受到極大的影響。於是德茂南貨店的李老闆想召集同行舉行一個會議，懇求大家同心恊力的抵制洋白糖。</p>
<p>本劇開始時，李老闆的老婆和女兒正在剥蓮子百合，預備燒了招待容人。母親埋怨李老闆又要化錢請客。女兒就對母親解釋，説這次請客是要大家商量營救沙糖市面的辦法，因爲繭價大跌，鄉下人都窮得乾蛤蟆一樣，沒有錢上街買貨，就貪便宜買走私貨了。但母親是不信走私會對市面發生什麽關係的。</p>
<p>李老闆是一個老實人，爲了走私壓廹了他的生意，也就跟他女兒一樣愛國起來了，但他以爲人人都像他一樣老實，所以不想信裕隆南貨店的王老闆會趁機買進一票洋白糖，來搶了！他的生意。他祇是要遮飾他店裏生意的淸淡，叫店員們等客人來後，時常將銅板撒得響一點。但他對於上海下鄉來的學生緝私隊，倒並不注意。</p>
<p>李華英的同學來了，説緝私家立刻要在火車站集中，叫她馬上去。</p>
<p>客人一個一個來了。高老闆有事不能來，叫他的兒子榮堂代表。王老闆第二個進來；劉老闆也跟着進來。於是他們坐下來，討論抵制洋白糖的問題。李老闆不大會説話，李華英就代替他演説走私和救國的關係。這得到了高榮堂的同情，王老闆也老奸陰刁地佯應着；劉老闆祗是稱讚李華英會話。</p>
<p>他們對於緝私的意見：劉老闆以爲中國的黄糖白糖没有賣相，所以不能抵制外國貨，而且做事一定要愼重，高榮堂的性子很烈，要馬上成立一個緝私隊，挨户檢查。王老闆則想用緩兵之計，使緝私隊慢慢組織起來，他好從中破壞。這時，裕隆的職員慌忙地跑來，和王老闆咬耳低語。他們這種行動，給李華英注意到了，她就偷偷地跑出去，報告學生緝私隊。</p>
<p>當女人們要向德茂店退貨，而去買價宜的走私貨時，火車站上羣衆爲了查私，打傷了人。羣衆又捉了裕隆的職員來，供出了王老闆是偷賣私糖，奸商。</p>
<p>最後，李華英受傷回來，拿了人造絲，回大家説明中國糖和中國繭賣不起錢的原因，都是給走私貨害了的。大家都感動了，立誓不再吃洋白糖，連留老闆也願意將他店裏的一點洋白糖封起來。</p>

<h3>Hunan Province's Opinion on the Hunan-Hubei Water Conservancy Dispute</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan recently convened relevant departments and representatives from Hunan and Hubei to discuss the Hunan-Hubei water conservancy dispute. It only decided to temporarily suspend the Tianhu Dike project and did not fully accept Hunan Province's opinion. The Hunan representatives telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. They received a reply on the 21st stating that the construction of the Tianhu project in Hunan Province was carried out in accordance with the order of the Nanchang Headquarters, with a deadline for completion, and a public letter from Secretary-General Weng of the Executive Yuan requesting the provincial government to advance funds. The Provincial Bank has already advanced 400,000 yuan, and the farmers have invested no less than several hundred thousand yuan. The project is more than 70% complete. If work is stopped for one day, and it is the season of spring floods, the entire project will be abandoned, and the funds will be wasted. Moreover, tens of thousands of dike workers must be given severance pay, which will have a significant impact on social order. Changing the laws and regulations will affect the credibility of the government. In addition to telegraphing Chairman Jiang and Vice Chairman Kong of the Executive Yuan to request their instructions to consider the plight of Hunan Province, they hope that the representatives will once again explain the situation to the relevant departments to avoid opinions from the provincial border.

<p>[Nanjing] The ancient tomb discovered near Zixia Cave in Nanjing has been excavated and restored by the Mausoleum Administration.

<h3>Prince De's Ambition ㊁</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Qian Hua</p>
<p>Wants to Use Foreign Forces to Become Genghis Khan; A Mongolian Scholar with Genius</p>
<p>㊁ Promoting Ambition</p>
<p>Prince De's hometown is in Pangjiang. Pangjiang is a transliteration of a Mongolian word, and there is no river at all in that place. It is just like Jiabusi, where the Chahar Border Mongolian Political Council is located. Jiabusi is also a Mongolian word, and there are no temples there either. It would be a joke for inland travelers to try to visit Pangjiang and Jiabusi. Prince De's palace in the West Sonid Banner is decorated very luxuriously, especially his study, which is filled with various Chinese and foreign newspapers, magazines, and many other books. Portraits of Hitler, Mussolini, and Kemal are hung on the walls. He often receives Chinese and foreign journalists and distinguished guests who come from afar. He is indeed a Mongolian scholar, with the demeanor of a statesman and a wealth of global knowledge. At the same time, he is also an artist, a musician, and possesses extremely clever talent. He is quite skilled in singing and painting, and his horsemanship is even stronger. Riding and shooting are his daily morning exercises. His accuracy in firing bullets and arrows is already above the average level. He is also good at Mongolian wrestling. When he has free time in the palace, he sometimes plays with photography, drives cars, and can even repair small machines himself. However, his clothing, daily life, and diet are very simple. Although there is a Beijing chef in the palace, he still eats ordinary Mongolian food except when entertaining guests. Mongolians possess ancient virtues, emphasizing trust and friendship. Their respect and obedience to the prince and their sincere belief in lamas are truly wholehearted, without any insincerity. Therefore, they naturally have even greater respect and obedience to this modern prince who can embrace the trends of the times and are willing to listen to his commands and drive. Prince De has a black mole on his forehead, and those who like to flatter say that he has the face of an emperor. Prince De's ambition has therefore flared up, and coupled with the convergence of circumstances and the temptation of material things, his ambition has expanded day by day, eventually leading to the situation today. He delusionally wants to use foreign forces to restore the achievements of his ancestor Genghis Khan. Therefore, in recent years, he has extensively recruited knowledgeable Mongolian youths, shouting the slogan of Mongolian national liberation and wanting to establish an independent country. He hates the Qing Dynasty's policy of control over Mongolia, especially the unbreakable religious belief, believing that Lamaism has ruined the life of the Mongolian people. He has vigorously instilled the knowledge of the new era into Mongolian youths. After receiving the new baptism, the general Mongolian people believe that this Prince De is the comet that appeared after the death of Genghis Khan. Many more forward-thinking princes also wholeheartedly support and admire him. On the one hand, Prince De, because he was too eager to govern, held power in everything as Secretary-General of the Mongolian Political Council, offending other princes and creating a situation where the Chahar and Suiyuan leagues and banners were divided. At the same time, due to the continuous explosion of various fuse lines, he quickly accepted certain parties' conditions for invading Mongolia, willingly acting as a puppet leader to realize his dream of becoming Genghis Khan the Second. Many experienced and prudent Mongolian intellectuals have expressed great dissatisfaction with Prince De's hasty means. Even Prince De himself, since the defeat in the Suiyuan War, has not failed to deeply reflect and realize his past mistakes. Someone asked Prince De: "You wanted to use others, but now, others have taken us into their grip, unable to move. How did this happen!" Prince De was naturally speechless. However, based on the slogan of national unity and the Chinese people not fighting the Chinese people, we always hope that those who have been exploited can quickly embark on the path of self-renewal. We can certainly forgive their past and cooperate sincerely. Moreover, Prince De is indeed a new-era figure and has a certain amount of power. The fundamental shattering of a certain party's Manchurian-Mongolian policy must depend on the great enlightenment of the Manchurian and Mongolian people themselves, building a Great Wall psychologically to resist the poisonous division and aggression. As the saying goes, what is past is past, and what is to come can be remedied. This is the only hope that our people have for Prince De!</p>
<p>㊂ Conspiracy and Goodwill</p>
<p>A certain party's plan to plunder Inner Mongolia is proceeding in parallel with the invasion of North China, and its meticulously planned conspiracy to invade Mongolia has been underway for far more than fifty years. Since Outer Mongolia inclined towards the Soviet Union, they believed that Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia had a vast border and would be an important battleground in future continental wars. Therefore, the plunder of Inner Mongolia was intensified, and Inner Mongolia also possessed vast economic resources, which were especially coveted by a certain party's capitalism. Special agents of a certain party are spread throughout Inner Mongolia, on the one hand, engaging in reconnaissance of terrain and resources, and on the other hand, trying to instigate and agitate, causing the Mongolian princes, large and small, to become divided and gradually alienated from the central government, creating the so-called "clarification" of Inner Mongolia. Among these special agents, the most famous was Dr. Shengdao, the former chief of the special agency stationed in Bailing Temple, who also held the rank of major general. His methods were also the most poisonous. He was a Mongolian expert, speaking fluent Mongolian. It can be said that the certain party's invasion conspiracy was entirely planned and implemented by him. He is now fifty-five years old and has been wandering in Mongolia for nearly thirty years. Initially, he was in Kulun, and later he traveled to various parts of Inner Mongolia. He has been a lama, familiar with the scriptures, and now has a Mongolian wife. His entire life is Mongolianized. He is very thin, with a long beard, likes to drink and tell jokes, and on the surface is truly amiable and approachable. He has endured many hardships in Mongolia for decades, and his skin has turned reddish-brown, but his body is very strong. Mongolians like to get small advantages, so he used this point to spend small amounts of money recklessly. Therefore, the general Mongolian people have a good impression of him. He opened a Good Neighbor School in Bailing Temple, providing free education to Mongolian elementary school students. The primary purpose was to instill pro-Japanese ideas in them. Mongolian and Japanese languages were emphasized, while Chinese was completely eliminated. Now, Chahar Province is full of such educational institutions. At the same time, he also established a cavalry officer school and a Good Neighbor Hospital in Bailing Temple. Mongolians do not pay much attention to hygiene, so there are many diseases and epidemics. In the past, when they got sick, they would ask lamas to chant scriptures, and the result was that more people died than lived. Now that there is a hospital, providing free diagnosis and treatment, they are of course extremely grateful. The psychology of the general Mongolian people has gradually changed to that Japanese are approachable, while Chinese are frightening. This kind of conspiracy is really terrible. The meaning of "Good Neighbor" has the same wonderful effect as the common "friendship and cooperation." The so-called "dagger hidden in a smile," this kind of friendship and cooperation is really frightening. But we must ask ourselves why, since the Mongolian and Han peoples are one family, the Mongolian people still have a frightening psychology towards us? If this point is not eradicated, the Mongolian problem will never be solved. "The transformation from frightening to approachable must be achieved through the joint efforts of the government and the people, and it is hoped that the border provincial authorities will pay special attention to this!"</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Shanghai Festival</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Shanghai Festival, after much preparation and discussion, was initiated yesterday, providing all citizens with public awareness. Officials are promoting it from above, and the gentry and commoners are encouraged from below, getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new, assisting in this grand event. The situation is enthusiastic and worthy of praise. Since the national crisis, the people have been in dire straits, suffering deeply from the poison and unable to find a way to relieve their worries. They are constantly under the pressure of sorrow and suffering, gradually becoming decadent and demoralized. Therefore, the worthy officials must seek other ways to revitalize and use it as a means of encouragement. On this day of brilliant spring sunshine, originally a day for people to enjoy life, we use commemorative forms to seek temporary joy, to create momentum, so that they are fully developed. The intention is profound. However, the name "Shanghai Festival" is still newly heard, and the common people may not be familiar with it. Therefore, following the intention of the authorities, we will briefly fulfill the responsibility of explaining it.</p>
<p>The reason why the Shanghai Festival is scheduled to be held on March 21 is that this day is the day when the National Revolutionary Army conquered Shanghai, and also the day when the citizens of Shanghai got rid of the shackles of the warlords. Before that day, people had no interest in life, suffering under the cruel regime and enduring the hardships of oppression. They were deprived of everything, large and small, and their thoughts were imprisoned, with prohibitions even on casual conversations. The rampage of the Big Sword Society, wantonly killing in the city, made the good people terrified and unsure of how to protect themselves. After that day, the people were revived, as if pulling themselves out of the mud, and enjoyed the joy of warmth and security again. They breathed in the free air, surpassing the coercion and exploitation. The past harassments were all eliminated. Therefore, this day is worthy of commemoration and is the unanimous request of the citizens. Regarding the significance of the Shanghai Festival, this is one aspect.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the only metropolis in the country, where guests from all directions rely on. People are numerous and businesses are busy. However, due to the complexity of the components, it is difficult to unite. Farmers, workers, merchants, students, military police, and officials all perform their duties in their respective positions on weekdays, and there are few opportunities to gather together, resulting in difficulty in communicating opinions and limiting knowledge to one corner. There is a sense of dedication, but a loss of the purpose of enjoying the community. Now, on the specified day, a grand gathering is held to allow them to participate and have fun together, to demonstrate the spirit of love and unity, and to show the necessity of mutual assistance and cooperation. As for welcoming gods and temple fairs, they were originally superstitious activities, but due to long-standing habits, it is not easy to change them suddenly. Moreover, farmers use this as a way to relieve labor and seek pleasure, and peddlers use this as a source of profit for selling goods. Forcing a ban will only cause disputes. Now, we can guide them according to the situation, make them comply with the scope, eliminate the concept of theocracy, maintain the practical meaning, ensure the upward trend of production, and increase the prosperity of the market. Reforming customs is a matter of transformation. Regarding the significance of the Shanghai Festival, this is the second aspect.</p>
<p>With the above significance clarified, the hard work of the authorities in promoting it is greatly admired by us. We sincerely hope that the worthy local party and government officials can all understand this intention, share it with others, restrain their subordinates, and support the people's aspirations. Do not abuse their power by relying on their position, and do not hold on to emotions and bully the kind and weak, to eliminate the occasional estrangement among the people, to promote the further development of the municipality, and to glorify the infinite reputation of the Shanghai Festival and pass it on to immortality.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Carries Three Main Conclusions of the Japanese Economic Survey Group</h3>
<p>Acknowledges That the Current State of Opposition Between China and Japan is Not Easy to Break; There is Ample Room for Economic Expansion in North and Central China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese economic survey group is scheduled to disband on the 22nd. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun today resumed carrying a Shanghai special dispatch, saying that after staying in China for a week, the survey group and others have formed three main conclusions: ㊀ Acknowledges the current state of opposition between China and Japan, and in the process of maintaining this state, except for reducing friction caused by occasional incidents between the two countries to the lowest limit, no further action can be taken; ㊁ It is undeniable that China has completed the organization of a modern country, so it is necessary to assist it in completing this organization. At the same time, China has frankly expressed its hope for Japanese assistance, so there is still a great deal of room for Japan to make further economic expansion in China; ㊂ However, because Britain has established a solid economic force in the Yangtze River basin, Japan has no other way to follow except to increase the volume of mutual goods in the Yangtze River basin and watch the unprotected investment activities. While Japan is limited to maintaining the status quo of Japan's economic power in Central China, it must take the economic expansion in North China as the basis for implementing Japan's overall economic policy towards China.

<h3>Japan Decides to Revamp Diplomatic Institutions</h3>
<p>Sato Considers Plan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the recent situation in the Diet, there is a high demand for reform of diplomatic institutions. At yesterday's general budget meeting, Tetsuo Kudo and Kozo Makiyama of the Minseito Party also demanded the implementation of this plan. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister both responded with the same feeling and agreed to begin implementing the reform of administrative institutions and the recruitment of external talent. Therefore, this matter will soon be realized. The scale of this reform of diplomatic institutions is relatively large. The Foreign Minister will soon submit a reference plan. It is heard that Foreign Minister Sato intends to take this opportunity to implement a considerable renovation. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Peers Prepares to Approve Original Budget Draft</h3>
<p>Diet Session May be Extended</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The deliberation of the budget in the House of Peers is progressing smoothly. It is expected to end the questioning around the 22nd and transfer it to the subcommittee for handling. Due to the imminent end of the session, Chairman Hayashi will announce his intention to request the government to extend the session, and then decide on the general policy. As for the attitude of each faction towards the budget proposal, it will be discussed separately after it is transferred to the subcommittee. It can only be decided at the final budget conference. The general intention is that this budget is an unprecedented amount and focuses on military spending. It is a lame budget, but considering the internal and external situation, its establishment is inevitable. However, the army and navy budgets that cannot be used within the year are included in this budget at 22 million yen each, which is questionable in terms of the constitution and seems inappropriate. Therefore, in the future, the preparation of the budget should not be taken as a precedent, and the government should be urged to pay attention. This opinion is very strong, so a serious supplementary resolution should be attached according to this intention, and then the original proposal will be approved. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] There are only five days left in the current Diet session. The government and members of the Diet both believe that the issue of extending the session must be specifically studied. Today is a festival day, and the actual number of deliberation days is only four days, so it is even more urgent. The government is currently struggling to decide on the number of days. The government is now expecting the statement of the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Peers on the 22nd in order to make a decision. Therefore, the meeting between Prime Minister Hayashi and Chairman Hayashi at that time is likely to be decided. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Develop Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>Establishes Comprehensive Research Institute; Promotes its Realization Within This Year</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Army, Navy, and Ministry of Communications have been vigorously studying countermeasures for the development of civil aviation and the improvement of air force strength. It has now been decided to establish a new central organization for comprehensive research on aviation to provide fundamental guidance. A specific plan has been obtained. As soon as the current Diet session closes, the three ministries will carefully discuss the important items such as the structure, operation, and objectives of the Central Aviation Research Institute, and quickly materialize it. It is expected to be promoted within this year.</p>
<p>In order to promote the performance of aircraft, the agency will conduct comprehensive research and experiments. Also, training aviation technicians and manufacturing civil aircraft are its main goals. The establishment and structure are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The new agency should be established separately from the existing aviation research agencies, and the important parts of the process of moving from the basic theory of aviation to the actual manufacturing process, such as aviation materials, special aircraft, engines, fuel, aviation meteorology, and aviation medicine, must be fundamentally researched and experimented, and guidance on manufacturing must be carried out in parallel. ㊁ Special large wind tunnels, large experimental water tanks, and various other equipment necessary for aviation research and experiments will be equipped.

<h3>Japanese-Made Giant Aircraft Completed</h3>
<p>Will be Test-Flown in Kagamigahara</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The ultra-long-distance aircraft designed and manufactured by the Imperial University Aviation Research Institute over a period of forty years, with a huge investment of hundreds of thousands of yen, has recently been completed and a world-class long-distance test flight has been decided. Captain Yuzo Fujita, an authority on the army's aviation, has been selected as the pilot. Also, since the aircraft is extremely large, it has been decided to temporarily disassemble it at the end of this month, transport it to Haneda Airfield, test its operation on the ground, and then send it to Kagamigahara Airfield to begin test flights. Depending on the results, it may soar over Kanto this autumn and set a world record for continuous flight. (21st Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Explores Overseas Markets</h3>
<p>Establishes Trade Mediation Offices</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Central Export Association plans to convene a council meeting in Tokyo on the 22nd to discuss various issues based on the government's policy of promoting trade. The association plans to change its policy, not only to be the central organization of the national export association, but also to seek the overall development of export trade, and to raise common issues in the trade community as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Establish overseas trade mediation offices; ㊁ Dispatch trade affairs trainees; ㊂ Investigate the credit of overseas merchants. In order to handle the above emergency business, preparations are now underway, and the most noteworthy is the establishment of trade mediation offices. The overseas commodity halls operated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished in the future, and all will be transferred to the Central Export Association for handling. For example, the Calcutta Commodity Hall of the Japan Industrial Association and the Slavoraya Commodity Exhibition Hall of the South Seas Association, as well as the Istanbul Commodity Hall of the Japan-Turkey Trade Association, will all be transferred to the association for operation. The association will take this opportunity and not fix the establishment of commodity halls in a certain city, but relocate them to major cities for a period of one or two years and rename them trade mediation offices in order to actively explore the market and make them active on the front lines.

<h3>Japan's Third Batch of Cash to be Shipped to the United States Soon</h3>
<p>Over 15 Million Yen</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government plans to ship cash to the United States, with an amount of 50 million yen. The first shipment was approximately 17.5 million yen, and the second shipment was approximately 16.7 million yen, totaling approximately 34.2 million yen. The first shipment is now planned to be approximately 15.8 million yen. Although the transport ship has not been decided, it seems likely that it will be transported by the Taiyo Maru (departing from Kobe on the 23rd) or the Chichibu Maru (departing from Kobe on the 6th of next month). The government's shipment of cash to the United States will come to an end after the third shipment. The situation after this will have to wait for a while. (21st Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Philippine Independence Issue</h3>
<p>U.S. Congressmen Say It Should Not Be Rushed</p>
<p>[Washington] Congress seems to be mostly sympathetic to Philippine President Quezon's suggestion to advance the date of Philippine independence. However, leading congressmen also said that rushing it may be harmful to the Philippines. Senator Nye said that the sooner the Philippines is independent, the better, but Congress should take action only after the expert committee submits a report. Once the Philippines is independent, its agricultural products should be treated the same as the goods of other countries, and the United States should not establish a strong naval base in the Philippines. Senator Walsh also said that the impact of Philippine independence on the naval position of the United States should also be studied. Senator Borah said that he fears that if the Philippines becomes independent in 1938 or 1939, it may not be able to cope with economic and financial difficulties, so he believes that Quezon's proposal is inappropriate.

<h3>Increase in China's Trade with Vietnam After Approval of Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>Last Year Saw a 70% Increase, with Raw Silk as the Main Export</p>
<p>▲Hanoi, Vietnam Correspondence: Following the formal approval of the Sino-French Commercial Treaty regarding Vietnam by both countries in 1935, China's exports to Vietnam have seen a significant increase. In the past year alone, the value of Chinese goods exported to Vietnam increased by 75% compared to the previous year. The total value of Chinese goods sold to Vietnam in the previous year was 5,643,000 Chinese dollars, which increased to 9,891,000 dollars last year. Among the exports, raw silk accounted for more than half. The value of raw silk exported to Vietnam in the previous year was 2,598,000 dollars, which increased to 5,285,000 dollars last year, an increase of 103%. In 1936, the countries purchasing raw silk from China were led by the United States, followed by France, with Vietnam ranking third. France purchased raw silk worth 8,790,000 dollars from China, while Vietnam's purchases amounted to 5,285,000 dollars, totaling more than 14 million dollars. Last year, the total value of raw silk purchased by the United States from China was only 11 million dollars. This shows that metropolitan France and its Asian colonies are the largest customers for Chinese raw silk. As for this year, there is hope for further improvement in trade between China and Vietnam, as Vietnam's economy has recovered in the past year, increasing people's purchasing power. Therefore, purchases of Chinese goods will inevitably increase compared to before. (Central News Agency, March 21, Havas Correspondence)</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Elected Members Vow to Fight for Freedom and Independence</h3>
<p>Amendment Passed on Oath-Taking Conditions; Gandhi Still Wields Influence Over the Congress</p>
<p>⊙New Delhi: Newly elected Congress provincial assembly members solemnly took an oath at the Congress headquarters under the bright light of countless electric lamps, pledging allegiance to the Congress and the nation. Congress President Nehru, who studied at Harrow and Cambridge Universities in England, slowly read the oath in Hindi, which was recited aloud by over a thousand people. The oath reads: "As a member of the All-India Congress, I swear allegiance to India and will work inside and outside the provincial assembly to achieve India's independence, end the exploitation of the Indian people, and alleviate their poverty. I swear to work under the discipline of the Congress to promote the Congress's principles and advance its goals, so that India may be free and independent, and its hundreds of millions of people may be relieved of the heavy burdens they now endure." Nehru then declared, "Taking office is out of the question if our conditions are not met. These are not empty conditions on paper." He also said that he personally felt that taking office would reduce the prestige of the Congress, but since the resolution to take office had been passed, he would obey like a common soldier. However, if the situation became impossible, he would ask the members to relieve him of his leadership responsibilities. Nehru's words indicated that he did not want to raise disputes immediately. According to Gandhi's words to guests, the resolution to take office was fair and impartial, without any reservations in intent. It should be read in its entirety and not divided. If the governor is willing to have Congress members take office, he feels there is no difficulty in the resolution in fully satisfying the leader of the Congress in his province. The resolution seeks nothing further. (Special dispatch from the North China Daily News, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙New Delhi: The organization of the All-India National Congress Party government in the Indian provinces has reached a deadlock due to the issue of taking office. The Standing Committee of the All-India National Congress had resolved that Congress members could only take office if the governors of each province guaranteed that they would not exercise the special powers granted by the new constitution. Now, after the Standing Committee has discussed the matter for thirteen hours, a proposal to amend this resolution has been passed by a vote of 127 to 70, allowing party members to take office in provinces where the Congress Party holds a majority in the legislature. However, Congress members may not assume administrative office unless the leader of the Congress Party in the provincial legislature is satisfied that the governor will not exercise his constitutional powers or disregard the advice of administrative officials, and can publicly declare this. With the passage of this resolution by the Standing Committee, each province can weigh the situation and handle the issue of taking office separately, without the need for each governor to issue guarantees that would invalidate important parts of the constitution. Therefore, the issue of whether to take office or not now depends on the relationship between each governor and the leader of the Congress Party. The passage of this resolution by a majority is seen as clear evidence that Gandhi still wields influence over the Congress. Gandhi's faction now seems to advocate striving to implement the Congress's program in accordance with the constitution. It is said that if the Congress forms a provincial government, it should not intentionally create a stalemate. If a stalemate is unavoidable, it will arise from the governor's restriction of the Congress's program, and the Standing Committee of the Congress will reconsider the overall situation. A notable feature of today's meeting was the relative failure of the socialist faction, which proves that they are not yet strong enough to challenge Gandhi's faction.

<p>[London] It is rumored that after King George holds his coronation ceremony on May 12, Prime Minister Baldwin will retire immediately, and the cabinet will be reorganized accordingly. In addition to the position of Prime Minister, which will be succeeded by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, it is now reported by the Daily Herald that Lord President of the Council MacDonald will also retire and be succeeded by former First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill, a leader of the Conservative Party's extreme faction.

<h3>Tragedy of a Village School Explosion in the United States</h3>
<p>Board of Directors Cannot Evade Blame</p>
<p>⊙New London: In the village school explosion here the other day, 425 teachers and students died. Today, the army sent personnel to investigate the truth. According to experts, the school's board of directors can hardly evade the blame for negligence. The number of deaths has now been re-checked. 286 corpses can be identified. Of the 125 injured, 48 are still being treated in the hospital. A total of 900 people were in the school at the time of the explosion. Only 350 people were not injured. A salesman from a boiler company told investigators that the company had repeatedly advised the school authorities to install safety equipment, but it was never adopted. Furthermore, the company was not notified before the switch to natural gas, which was extremely negligent. A boiler engineer also stated that he had warned the school board that an explosion would occur sooner or later. However, local prosecutor Wells said that there was no need to file criminal charges at this time. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Sudden Dismissal of Stummer, Key Figure in Austrian Pro-German Faction</h3>
<p>State Secretary Assumes Concurrent Responsibility for Police Affairs; National Socialist Party's Influence Hit</p>
<p>[Vienna] The influence of the Austrian National Socialist Party has now suffered another major blow. Stummer, the Minister of Public Security representing the National Socialist Party's influence in the Austrian cabinet, was dismissed today by State Secretary Schuschnigg. Stummer was appointed Minister of Public Security after the conclusion of the German-Austrian agreement on June 11, 1936. However, after Stummer took office, he often clashed with the State Secretary due to his excessive National Socialist tendencies. Stummer's dismissal is also the result of the intensification of the conflict between Germany and Austria. The deterioration of the national conditions of the two countries can be seen in the tone of the newspapers of both sides. After Stummer's dismissal, the post of Minister of Public Security will be held concurrently by Schuschnigg himself. Schuschnigg, who holds the important positions of State Secretary, Army, and Foreign Affairs, is now in charge of police affairs as well, and his power is increasingly prominent. However, the actual work of the Ministry of Public Security will be handled by Skubl, who has served as the Director of the Vienna Police Department for the past two and a half years. He is a close friend of former State Secretary Dollfuss and is also the most vocal opponent of National Socialism. (Central News Agency, March 19, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Vienna] An official bulletin was recently released stating that President Miklas has approved State Secretary Schuschnigg's request to dismiss Minister of Public Security Stummer. The vacant position will be held concurrently by the State Secretary, and Vienna Police Chief Skubl will be appointed as Deputy Minister of Public Security. The bulletin further explained the reasons, stating that when the domestic political situation was tense, the government organized a committee, chaired by Stummer, to draft special laws to prevent communism and National Socialism. Recently, Stummer demanded the repeal of various anti-National Socialist laws, which caused great difficulty. This is the reason for his dismissal. In the future, the committee will continue to work, and the current constitution based on the professional group system will also be implemented as before. In addition, responsible parties declared that Stummer was a representative of the pro-German faction in the cabinet. Recently, people close to him had attempted to form various cultural groups to promote Pan-Germanism, but State Secretary Schuschnigg took a negative attitude towards this activity, so the pro-German faction was in a dilemma. In addition, the Catholic People's Daily of Linz was ordered by Stummer to suspend publication five times for opposing the pro-German faction. The general public was annoyed by the fact that Stummer had taken this decision at a time when German newspapers were attacking Austria. All of these are the reasons for Stummer's departure.

<h3>German Political Circles Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>The Attempt of the Austrian National Socialist Party to Participate in Politics is Almost Shattered</p>
<p>[Berlin] When the news of the dismissal of Austrian Minister of Public Security Stummer reached Germany, political figures expressed dissatisfaction, believing that National Socialism had suffered a blow in Austria. It was said that the movement to punish National Socialism in Austria was presided over by Vienna Police Chief Skubl, who is one of the main enemies of National Socialism in Austria. Now he has been promoted to Deputy Minister of Public Security, which is very unfavorable to National Socialism. It is hoped that State Secretary Schuschnigg will use his influence to move towards a moderate path, so that Austria's foreign policy will not be affected. In general, it is believed that German Foreign Minister Neurath's recent visit to Austria was primarily aimed at enabling members of the Austrian National Socialist Party to participate in the government. Now this attempt has almost been shattered. (Central News Agency, March 20, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Paris Pays Attention</h3>
<p>Tension in German-Austrian Relations Increases the Severity of the European Situation</p>
<p>[Paris] The tension in relations between Germany and Austria can be seen in the war of words in the newspapers of both sides. The local newspapers have paid attention to this. Among them, the right-wing "People's Friend" newspaper stated, "The sudden attack on Austria by German newspapers is a pretext for the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to indicate to Austrian State Secretary Schuschnigg that Germany is extremely dissatisfied with the evolution of the country's policies. Schuschnigg does not seem to be moved by this. The dismissal of the country's Minister of Public Security Stummer yesterday shows that Schuschnigg is determined to maintain the country's independence, even knowing that this action could endanger his life. This is commendable. The left-wing socialist newspaper stated, "The intensity of the attacks on Austria by the German press is greater than the attacks on France when relations between France and Germany were most tense. Foreign diplomatic figures in Berlin believe that this is a method used by German leader Hitler to indicate to Austrian State Secretary Schuschnigg that Germany is dissatisfied with the policies pursued by Austria since German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Vienna last month. In other words, German Foreign Ministry is not happy that State Secretary Schuschnigg wants to get closer to Hungary and even Czechoslovakia, regardless of everything." The New Era newspaper of the same party stated, "It is obvious that the German government has been defeated everywhere. This time, its attempt to promote expansion policies in Austria and Hungary has also encountered resistance, and it feels resentment." The right-wing Petit Journal stated, "The severity of the current crisis is unparalleled, and Hitler's ambition is greater than ever. Perhaps the small countries will form a new group because of this common disaster. It is also unknown." (Central News Agency, March 21, Havas Dispatch)</p>

Antonescu also declared that Romania will never be subject to German political or economic control, because Romania has signed commercial agreements with Britain, France, the Balkan Peninsula, and Central European countries, and will never break its oath. As for the issue of the restoration of the old Habsburg dynasty of Austria, although Austria and Hungary want to treat it as a purely domestic issue, Romania regards it as an international issue.

<h3>Outline of Italian Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Advocates the Resumption of Cooperation Among the Four Major European Powers; Says Italy Has No Territorial Ambitions in Spain</p>
<p>—Article Published by Italian Dictator's Spokesman Gayda—</p>
<p>[Rome] An article written by the famous reporter Gayda, published in the semi-official "Italian Daily", outlining Italy's foreign policy, is noteworthy. The content can be divided into three main points: ㊀ To restore the Locarno Treaty on the basis of the joint cooperation of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, ㊁ Countries with colonies should form a united front, ㊂ Regarding the Spanish issue, a consensus should be established among all countries, and Britain should also be invited to participate. In addition, Gayda denied rumors that Italy intends to develop abroad and expand its territory, saying, "Dictator Mussolini has repeatedly stated that Italy is determined to cooperate with European countries, especially with Britain and France. As for the 'European Axis' created by Germany and Italy, it will certainly not cause Germany and Italy to become alienated from Britain and France to an irreparable extent. From this, all kinds of rumors will naturally be self-defeating." Referring to the conflict between democracy and fascism, he said, "What we demand is to reduce political terrorism and restore the minimum level of mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual tolerance among European countries." The reporter also said, "The Italian government recently submitted a note to Britain, responding to Italy's attitude towards the new Locarno Treaty issue. The purpose of this note is to restore the unity of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in 1925, which is the most direct guarantee of European peace and stability, it was so in the past, and it is still so now. Moreover, if countries with colonies cannot form a united front to solve the common problems of various countries in Africa in the spirit of justice and benevolence, it will be difficult to create a stable situation among the countries. We have repeatedly said this without hesitating to speak out. As for the Spanish issue, it concerns peace, order, and territorial integrity. The communist movement within Spain is a revolutionary gunpowder magazine in the Mediterranean, and the location of this gunpowder magazine is right at Britain's doorstep, enough to endanger the lifeline of the British Empire. The goal of Italy's policy is only to eliminate this disaster that threatens the welfare of Europe. As for Italy itself, it has nothing to gain, whether in terms of territory or politics, Italy has no ambition. Britain has huge interests in the Mediterranean, involving the fate of the empire and in need of protection. Now that Italy's policy is so frank, it is difficult to see why Britain alone cannot cooperate with it. (Central News Agency, March 20, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Expands Cotton Industry in North China, Investing Another 35 Million</h3>
<p>Six Major Spinning Mills to Be Added in Tianjin, Completing a Plan for 800,000 Spindles, and a Dye Factory Will Be Established to Supply Dyes</p>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: Japan's plan to develop the economy of North China includes projects such as the Cangshi Railway, the Longyan Iron Mine, the Tanggu Port Construction, and the expansion of the cotton industry, all of which are being pursued separately. However, problems such as mining, port construction, and road construction must be negotiated and agreed upon with our side before they can be implemented, so the maturation period will not be as rapid as the Japanese side hopes. However, the expansion of the cotton industry does not require our consent, so the Japanese side has decided to complete it ahead of schedule. It is planned that Japanese business circles will invest another 35 million yuan to add six major spinning mills in Tianjin. They can start operations one after another when new cotton comes on the market next year. The plan is described below. There are currently six existing spinning mills in Tianjin, including Hengyuan, Yuyuan, Yuda, Bincheng, Huaxin, and Beiyang. Except for Yuda, which is a Japanese-owned factory, the rest are purely Chinese-owned. In recent years, due to the downturn in the cotton industry and the lure of large sums of money from the Japanese side, except for Hengyuan and Beiyang, the others have been successively acquired by the Japanese Kanebo and Kanegafuchi spinning companies, and the Daifuku company. Huaxin and Bincheng have been renamed Gongda Nos. 6 and 7 factories. In addition, the Japanese Toyo Cotton Spinning Company has invested 6.5 million yuan to purchase 200 mu of land in Dazhigu, a special area, to build the Yufeng Spinning Mill, which has 50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. The construction work has already been completed and was originally scheduled to start on April 1, but because the workers recruited from Qingdao needed to undergo considerable training first, it was decided to postpone the start to May 1. This is the first factory of Yufeng. There are also the second and third factories. The second factory is scheduled to start in about August, and the third factory is scheduled to start next spring. Therefore, there are now a total of four Japanese-owned spinning mills in Tianjin, including Yufeng, Yuda, and Gongda Nos. 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Japan's plan to expand the cotton industry in North China was outlined three years ago. Previously, Mr. Funatsu Choichiro, the chairman of the Japan Cotton Textile Industry Association in China, came to Tianjin from Shanghai with this plan and made final contacts with the Japanese military headquarters and the Japanese consulate in Tianjin. He received strong support from the Japanese military headquarters and the Japanese consulate, and they urged him to implement it as soon as possible. The content of the plan is to add six major spinning mills in Tianjin (ten factories including the existing ones): (1) Tianjin Textile Company, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 100,000 spindles, and 1,500 looms; (2) Dai Nippon Spinning Factory, with a capital of 10 million yuan, 150,000 spindles, and 3,000 looms; (3) Kurashiki Spinning Factory, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 100,000 spindles, and 1,000 looms; (4) Naigaiwata Men Kaisha, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 30,000 spindles, and the number of looms is unknown; (5) Kishiwada Spinning Factory, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 100,000 spindles, and 1,200 looms; (6) Wakayama Spinning Company, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 50,000 spindles, and 1,000 looms. The total capital of the above six factories is 35 million yuan, which will be invested by Kanebo, Kanegafuchi, Toyo, and Osaka textile circles. The names are determined as above. Among them, Tianjin Textile Company will be established ahead of schedule. The company adopts a board of directors and supervisors system. The six directors are Mochida Tatsumi, Ito Chubei, Uematsu Manabu, Niie Ryo, Oshishima Soshiro, and Nakatani Shohei. The managing director and representative of the company is Ito Chubei. The four supervisors are Fukumoto Motonosuke, Ito Takenosuke, Tomiyoshi, and others. They have purchased 200 mu of land in Zhengzhuangzi, on the Haihe River in Tianjin, and are actively building the factory, which is scheduled to start operations in July of this year.</p>
<p>After the above six factories start operations, combined with the existing four factories, they will have 800,000 spindles. The cotton industry in North China is undoubtedly under Japanese control. The required amount of dyes for dyeing cloth is considerable, so there is also a plan to establish a dye manufacturing factory in Tianjin. Qingdao Restoration Chemical Society has recently cooperated with Mitsubishi Imperial Dye Company to establish a factory in Tianjin to mainly manufacture vulcanized black, with a monthly production of about 300,000 catties, to meet the needs of various cotton mills in North China, replacing European and American products. They are currently surveying the factory site and ordering machines, and it is expected that manufacturing will begin soon. (19th)</p>
<h3>The New Hunan Finance Director Yin Renxian Takes Office</h3>
<p>Director Yin Reveals Several Matters to Encourage Finance Department Staff</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence: The newly appointed Director of the Department of Finance, Yin Renxian, arrived in the province a few days ago. He originally planned to be sworn into office together with the new Provincial Committee member Chen Quzhen on the 16th, but because the central government had not yet appointed a person to administer the oath, he and Chen first went to the Provincial Government on that day to attend the Provincial Committee meeting, and the oath ceremony will be held later. After participating in the meeting, Yin went to the Department of Finance to take office. The former director, He Haoruo, led the entire staff to welcome him. Yin nodded in response to the crowd. After sitting down for a while, the Department held a handover ceremony. All the staff gathered in the auditorium. Former Director He accompanied Yin to the hall. After the ceremony was held in accordance with the prescribed procedures, Yin gave a speech, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"I am very happy to have the opportunity to return to the province to serve and work with you all. I have been away from the province for a long time, and I am not very clear about the current situation in the province. You are all veterans in the financial world, and you are naturally very familiar with the local financial situation. I hope that everyone will continue to work hard and assist me with the same spirit of assisting Director He. This is also what I am most happy about. During my tenure in the Henan Department of Finance, the use of personnel and administration was completely open. The veteran staff within the Department are not easily changed. When there are vacancies that need to be filled, and accounting personnel and collection personnel from other counties, unless they are sent from the national college entrance examination or the general examination, they are publicly and strictly examined, or selected in order after training. I have never appointed anyone privately. I feel that adjusting personnel in this way is more orderly. In the future, if this Department needs to appoint personnel, it will also follow this method and conduct a completely open examination in order to find true talents. This is the first point I want to say to everyone. The most easily suspected and misunderstood thing is the issue of money, especially for financial personnel whose actual responsibilities and matters are all related to money. Therefore, the most important thing for financial personnel is "integrity." During my tenure in Henan, I paid special attention to the integrity of civil servants during the assessment. Only with honest civil servants can we talk about the efficiency of financial administration. The expenses within the Department are absolutely transparent. In the past, all the surpluses from ticket prices and labor costs, as well as the interest earned from storing public funds, were returned to the treasury. All payments, such as purchasing goods, were made through bidding methods to ensure actual prices and avoid any false statements. This method will also be followed by this Department. Regarding the selection of accounting and general affairs personnel, when necessary, we may also use examination methods to select them. This is the second point I want to clarify to everyone. The finances of this province, under the guidance of Chairman He and the management of Director He, have gradually been brought onto the right track. I am not very talented, but I will abide by Chairman He's intentions, follow Director He's established rules, and abide by the laws and regulations to move forward on the right track. Because the right track of finance is the law. All financial matters should be carried out within the scope of the law, which is naturally orderly and organized. If we deviate from the law, it will be unrestrained, and I am afraid it will inevitably lead to chaos. Therefore, abiding by the law is the only condition for handling finance, and it cannot be ignored in the slightest. This is the third point I want to say to everyone. In addition, there are other things I hope from you. First, we civil servants should put public affairs first and not focus on personal gain. Because the government establishes offices and divides governance to enable each person to do their best and concentrate their efforts to seek the interests of the masses. As long as we conscientiously perform our duties, fulfill our responsibilities, and move forward bravely, we will naturally receive the rewards we deserve based on our merits. If we do not do our best in the tasks we are assigned and only focus on seeking personal gain, such self-interest and advancement are not what modern civil servants should have. I hope you will pay attention to this. Secondly, our financial personnel should revitalize their spirits, bring up their energy, and not be content with the status quo, be lazy, perfunctory, and procrastinate. Because finance is the mother of all governance. If finance is not handled well, then all politics cannot be promoted. Therefore, we civil servants must help each other in everything, not be jealous of each other, but encourage each other, concentrate our spirits, and do our best to carry out our work in order to achieve administrative efficiency. This is also what I hope you will pay attention to. Finally, what I want to ask you to abide by and practice is the New Life Movement advocated by President Chiang, the basic internal work of which is "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame." Not only should our daily life be "clean, simple," as a necessary condition, but also in our duties, especially financial personnel who bear the mission of finance, every move must conform to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame" as the standard. Because propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame have the deepest meaning. To sum up, propriety is abiding by the law, righteousness is forgetting self-interest, integrity is eliminating greed, and a sense of shame is getting rid of dirt. In the responsibilities of financial personnel, none of them are dispensable. I hope to supervise and encourage each other and work hard."</p>
<p>After Yin finished his speech, former Director He gave a speech, saying that he had been in the Department for 19 months. Although there is still much to be sorted out in the province's finances, compared with before, there are already clues. Fortunately, my duties have not been delayed, so I feel very happy to leave the Department today. During these 19 months, although the province's finances have been reorganized and some achievements have been made, this is all thanks to Heaven and the responsible assistance of my colleagues in the Department. I cannot but express my gratitude to my former colleagues today. Director Yin's morality and knowledge far exceed mine. I believe that he will be able to improve the province's finances. I hope that you will continue to work hard and assist him with the spirit of responsibility you have shown on weekdays under the guidance of Director Yin. This is what I want to say to you as I leave. After He finished his speech, he announced the end of the ceremony and everyone dispersed.</p>
<p>It is said that Yin only brought his entourage Liu Ming'an, Cao Guanru, and Zhang Pengxiang from Henan to Hunan. He ordered that all the existing staff of the Finance Department should continue to work in their original positions to make use of their expertise. It is also said that Liu and Cao, who came with him, were originally secretaries of the Henan Finance Department and will still be appointed as secretaries or section chiefs in the Department. Zhang, who was originally a staff member of the Henan Finance Department, has now been temporarily appointed as a staff member in the Department and will temporarily take charge of accounting and general affairs.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou-Shantou Authorities Improve Treatment of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Suffered Greatly in the Past, but Future Suffering Can Be Avoided</p>
<p>Shantou correspondence: Every year, more than 250,000 people from Chaozhou and Shantou go abroad and return home. The movement of immigrants has always been closely related to the prosperity and decline of society and has attracted the attention of people from various countries. For example, a few years ago, when the world economy collapsed, the colonies in Southeast Asia restricted the entry of Chinese workers and promulgated various harsh regulations. People from Chaozhou and Meizhou were subject to the restrictions of these regulations and had no way out. The economy and finance in various places immediately showed signs of stagnation and panic, and people's livelihood and society suffered a major blow. Since the winter of the year before last, the prices of local products in Southeast Asia have risen, and the market has become increasingly prosperous. Last year, overseas Chinese remitted 80 million yuan back to Chaozhou and Shantou, a sharp increase from 40 million yuan. The economic recession in various places disappeared with it. Overseas Chinese going abroad and their families also surged like a tide, so that Shantou was waiting to be exported to foreign countries, and the number of ship berths was in excess of supply, and the price of ship tickets soared. The price of a first-class cabin ticket to Singapore, which was originally 35 yuan, soared to 150 yuan, and you still had to wait in a hotel for a long time before you could buy one. Moreover, the ticket prices were controlled by shipping companies and hotels. The Singapore government only allows 6,000 Chinese workers to enter each month. The ticket quota is distributed to the shipping companies in various ports. Women, children, and old customers are not subject to this restriction. Each ticket can be purchased for about 46 yuan, which is a stark difference in treatment compared to newly arrived Chinese workers. It is said that those who controlled ship tickets last year made a net profit of more than 700,000 yuan, which was all squeezed out of the sweat and blood of the Chinese workers.</p>
<p>The Shantou Municipal Government received the "Overseas Chinese Entry and Exit Regulations" issued by the Provincial Government yesterday. Those who register in accordance with the regulations can purchase ship tickets from the shipping company in the order of registration, and get rid of the extra squeeze from those who control the tickets. The main points of the method are as follows: (A) Registration Notice: When applying for registration, overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country should bring a two-and-a-half-inch photo, fill out a form at the registration office. Those going abroad must submit their passports or the return documents from the local government for verification. Those entering the country should submit the credentials from their place of residence for verification. Those who have completed the above procedures can register for free. (B) Registration for Going Abroad: The registration form must be filled in with the applicant's name, age, place of origin, occupation, education, experience, skills, family situation, cohabiting relatives, economic situation, purpose of going abroad, current destination, whether they are a member of the Kuomintang, passport number, and domestic and foreign mailing address, and a photo must be attached. The contents of the entry and exit registration form are roughly the same. After registration, you can get many conveniences and reduce countless unnecessary oppressions, extortions, and sufferings. In addition, the Shantou Port Quarantine Station harshly extracts one yuan for inspection fees from overseas Chinese going abroad, and another six jiao for photo fees. It is found that the number of people leaving Shantou every year is more than 120,000, and if the fees are collected according to the amount, 200,000 yuan can be obtained. Various hometown associations and overseas Chinese organizations in Shantou have sent telegrams to protest, organized committees, and actively worked with the quarantine station. The trend is expanding. The Fifth District Administrative Office, according to the petition of the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society and the Hotel Industry Association to abolish the abuses against sick overseas Chinese, has forwarded the petition to the Provincial Government for verification. It seems that they are aware of the need to improve the treatment of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Lawyers' Association Re-election</h3>
<p>The Lawyers' Association of this county held an annual meeting at 2 p.m. on the 11th and re-elected officials. Fifty-six lawyers, including Mao Yun, attended. The County Party Department sent Sun Zongbing to guide, and the District Court sent Prosecutor Zhang Yaoyuan to supervise the election. The results of the re-election were: Chen Qiushi as the president, Zhang Yingkui as the vice president, and seven councilors, Zhang Zhijie, Zhang Huanzhi, Zhang Juansheng, Sun Deji, Peng Zhongjun, Wu Luping, and Zhu Kuangzheng, were elected. Three secretaries, Tu Heyun, Wu Chengbi, and Qin Quanze, were elected. Then, many cases were discussed.</p>
<h3>Kunshan County Magistrate Peng Transferred to Jiangning</h3>
<p>Kunshan County Magistrate Peng Baichuan has been in office since March of the 23rd year, a period of three years. On the 19th, the Provincial Government decided to transfer him to be the Magistrate of Jiangning County. The vacancy in this county will be filled by Wen Chongxin, the Magistrate of Taicang County. It is learned that County Magistrate Peng is ordering the departments to prepare for the handover so that he can go to Ning as soon as possible. The date on which County Magistrate Wen will come to Kunshan has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Plans to Launch Cars Between Suzhou and Dongshan</h3>
<p>Director Yan of the 11th District of Dongshan said that because transportation there is inconvenient, relying only on ships, and that the district produces white sand loquats, Biluochun tea, etc., with a very large annual output, but development is difficult due to inconvenient transportation, he specially united with Director Wang of the 5th District of Hengjing and others to discuss the preparation of a Suzhou-Zhongshan long-distance bus company (i.e., Suzhou to Dongshan). The entire line is 40 kilometers long and the fixed capital is 300,000 yuan. It has been agreed that the 12 districts will be responsible for one-third, the 25 districts will be responsible for one-third, and the 1 district will be responsible for one-third. A plan is being drafted and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Inspects All Sales and Smoking Establishments</h3>
<p>The County Anti-Smoking Association of this county believes that the number of smokers in various sales and smoking establishments is gradually decreasing, and their business is insufficient to maintain them, resulting in the supply of private smoking to unlicensed smokers, etc., which is detrimental to everything that is happening. Yesterday, the County Government was specifically notified by public letter to inspect all sales and smoking establishments in the county. If it is found that the number of smokers is decreasing and the operating profit is insufficient to maintain expenses, they will be ordered to close down immediately to avoid the private sale of opium paste, which is detrimental to the promotion of anti-smoking policies.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Demolishes Qingshan Bridge Street</h3>
<p>Qingshan Bridge Drawbridge Street, north of Wuyi County, has always been a bustling market. Lin Jun, chairman of the Bridge Engineering Committee of Chenbei, once submitted a request to the County Government to rebuild and widen the street to facilitate people's travel. The County Government sent personnel to measure and formulate a plan, which was submitted to the Construction Department for approval. Recently, the County Government believes that the funds for building the bridge and widening the street are urgently needed, so it ordered the committee to raise 4,000 yuan in advance and deposit it for special use. Once the instructions are approved, bids will be invited for construction. It is also stipulated that the width of the street will be 12 meters, and the district chief of the district, Zhao Changfeng, was instructed to inform the residents on both sides of the street to prepare for the transfer.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang West Gate Avenue to Be Demolished</h3>
<p>Regarding the reconstruction of West Gate Avenue, the demolition has now been completely completed. A public notice will be issued by the Provincial Government in one week, setting a deadline for demolition. From the date of the public notice, it is stipulated that the obstacles within the designated road line must be completely demolished within 40 days. It is planned to build a macadam road on the road surface. The road width is stipulated to be 15 meters. After the houses are demolished, construction can begin immediately. Regarding the collection of benefit fees, it is planned to follow the methods promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the average profit and loss rules for urban road construction in various counties stipulated by the Construction Department. This fee will be used to pay for the land of the demolished houses and to enhance the appearance of the West Gate Avenue. It is planned to stipulate the standard style of the city houses built on the road and order the county to handle it in order to achieve uniformity.</p>
<h3>Nantong Police Officer Embezzles and Murders Case</h3>
<p>Yao Dangping, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, Zhao Jinjia, the police chief, and Yang Weiting, the detective chief, led the police to solve the Yu Xi bandit case, embezzling 2,270 yuan of stolen goods and killing a Xu surnamed child without authorization. The Commissioner's Office transferred Yao Dangping and others to the court for investigation. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Yao and others for embezzlement and murder. Liu, the judge of the Criminal Division of the 10th District, opened the trial. Yao Dangping confessed that he only took 45 yuan from the stolen money to reward the police officers and denied shooting. However, the police officer Sun Baozhang pointed out in court that Yao Dangping had shot the gun. The court ordered the three defendants, Yao, etc., to be remanded in custody pending further evidence and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Decides to Build the Fengcai Road</h3>
<p>The United Office of Townships and Towns in Fengqiao District, Jiaxing, recently resolved to build a section of road from Fengqiao Bridge to Caijia Bridge, named Fengcai Road, to facilitate transportation. However, the route requires requisitioning farmland and land from the people and demolishing houses, resulting in significant losses. After local residents Mei Jiying and others expressed objections and petitioned the Party and government authorities to exempt them from construction, the County Government specifically dispatched Zhu Yisheng, the head of the Construction Section, to convene a meeting of the township heads concerned at the township yesterday to discuss the matter for a long time. It was decided to build the road and specific measures were determined: (1) Narrow the road surface and restrict the scope of land acquisition to reduce losses to the people (the entire road only needs 150-60 acres of land); (2) It was decided not to demolish houses in places such as the bridge; (3) In addition to using the original bridge as much as possible, the 5-6 new bridges to be built will be wooden bridges built with pine and cypress; (4) Construction of the road must begin before the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan County's Comprehensive Construction Work</h3>
<p>The Xiaoshan Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee held its inaugural meeting on the 17th.

<p>▲ Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st. The second match between the Shanghai Zhonghua basketball team and the Military Academy team took place at the Amateur Athletic Association on the afternoon of the 20th. Two thousand spectators attended. Feng Nianhua's arrival boosted the Zhonghua team significantly, and his performance was extremely lively. Wang Nanzhen and Cai Yanxiong, the two guards, provided excellent defense. The Military Academy team appeared disorganized, and Wang Yuzeng, still recovering from a cold, lacked leadership. Apart from the first five minutes when they briefly led with scores of 3-0 and 7-5, they remained behind for the entire game. At halftime, Zhonghua led 19-12, with a seven-point advantage. In the second half, Feng Nianhua and Zhou Dayun, the two forwards for Zhonghua, were extremely active. Feng Nianhua was relentless, and Zhou Dayun's shots were consistently accurate. In the final ten minutes, they created a significant score difference of 41-16. Despite the Military Academy team making numerous substitutions, it was to no avail.

At this time, Wang Shixuan left the court due to committing two consecutive fouls. Zhou Dayun of the Shanghai team replaced Chen Zongqi. Upon entering the game, Zhou immediately scored three points, making it 16-17, with a difference of only one point. This was the most intense moment of the first half. Subsequently, the Military Academy became active again. Yuzeng, weakened by illness, focused on passing, with Guo and Bao, the two forwards, coordinating in front and behind with extremely swift tactics, making it difficult for the Shanghai team to grasp. They scored seven consecutive points. The Shanghai team relied on Dayun's skillful play to keep pace. The first half ended with the Military Academy leading 29-25.</p>
<p>▲ A Tie</p>
<p>After switching sides, Yuzeng was replaced by Li Shengchun (i.e., Ma Qinghe). After ten selections, he scored nine points alone. Dayun responded with a point, making it 24-27. Yuzeng re-entered, and his momentum increased. The Shanghai team worked hard to defend and closely followed the score, with the difference fluctuating between six and seven points. When the score reached 40-20, Shixuan was dismissed for committing his fourth foul and was replaced by Yi Zhao. With ten minutes remaining until the end of the game, spectators felt that the Military Academy was in danger. The Shanghai team seized the opportunity, launching a full-scale attack. Their offensive efforts were highly successful, and they quickly tied the score at 40-40. The audience felt that the Military Academy was in danger.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Slump</p>
<p>Both sides responded cautiously, maintaining the stalemate.

The team's morale rose, and they scored two more consecutive points. Bao and Guo, the two forwards, also found success, and the score soared, creating a surge of 55-42, establishing the overall situation. At this point, the Shanghai team had no ability to counterattack. Wenpei added two more points, and Dayun and Zude also scored. Finally, Wang Yuzeng scored two more points at the end of the game.

<h3>Yesterday's Jiangwan Six-Mile Cross-Country Race: Wuhe Team Wins Double Championship</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Sports Association Team A Ranks Second by a One-Point Difference</p>
<p>▲ Individual Champion Wu Wenlin Sets Excellent New Record</p>
<p>The Jiangwan six-mile team cross-country championship, organized by the Shanghai Sports Association, started at 11 a.m. yesterday at the west gate of Hongkou Park. A large number of people participated, jostling and shoving, making it a grand occasion. Thousands of spectators watched, causing traffic congestion on Jiangwan Road. As a result, the team and individual championships were won by the new force Wuhe team. Wuhe defeated the Shanghai Sports Association A team by one point with a score of 116, ranking first to 117 respectively. The individual champion was Wu Wenlin of the Wuhe team, breaking the previous record of 29 minutes and 34.4 seconds held by Wang Zhenglin of the Yimi team (formerly Wuhe) with an excellent time of 29 minutes and 34.3 seconds. Long-distance running star Wang Zhenglin lost his running shoe in the mud, making it difficult to walk on the cinder path, and ended up finishing in twelfth place. The prizes were awarded by Mrs. Westphal, concluding a grand cross-country race. The detailed information is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Competition Process</p>
<p>All athletes lined up in front of the side gate of Hongkou Park. At 11 a.m., the starting gun fired, and the Chinese and Western athletes surged forward, crowding together. After three minutes, they gradually separated and formed a straight line. The first to take the lead was Wan Jinsheng of the Hongkou team. Wang Zhenglin, Niu Hongquan, Wu Wenlin, and others, who attracted the most attention, followed closely behind Wan. Ling Xuewen, Ma Riji, and Zhang Liang lagged about ten meters behind, turning right onto a small wooden bridge. Wang Zhenglin suddenly increased his speed, slightly outpacing the others and taking the lead. Wu Youlin and Niu Hongquan remained close behind. Wan Jinsheng, Ling Xuewen, Ma Riji, Li Duan, and Zhang Liang also followed closely. However, after several days of spring rain, the rural mud roads were still flooded, making it difficult for the athletes to traverse. Wang Zhenglin accidentally lost one of his spiked shoes in the mud, causing him to fall behind. After passing the Livestock Company, he exited the mud road and entered the Dong Sports Association Road. Ling Xuewen suddenly stepped forward, taking a remote lead. Wu Wenlin and Niu Hongquan moved forward, side by side, neck and neck, unseparated. Ma Riji and Zhang Liang followed closely, unwilling to let go. The original leader Wang Zhenglin had fallen back to fifteenth place. Turning left again onto a cinder road, Ma Riji surged forward, suddenly surpassing Wu, Niu, and Ling. Zhang Liang, Gao Basheng, and Guan Youwen followed closely behind. After Wang Zhenglin lost his spiked shoe, he found the cinder road more difficult, dashing his hopes of winning the championship. After crossing the small wooden bridge at the outpost, Niu Hongquan accelerated, and Wu Wenlin also pursued fiercely. Ma Riji and Ling Xuewen gradually fell behind. By the time they reached the Hongkou Swimming Pool, the finish line was not far off. Wu Wenlin had plenty of energy, sprinting like a flying arrow, surpassing Niu Hongquan and reaching the finish line first, in a time of 29 minutes and 34.2 seconds, setting a new excellent record. Niu finished ten meters behind and ranked second. Third was Ma Riji, fourth was Ling Xuewen, and the others followed in succession. The Wuhe team won the team championship, defeating the Shanghai Sports Association A team.</p>

<h3>China Will Not Officially Participate in the International Volleyball Tournament</h3>
<p>—The China United Team Will Join Unofficially—</p>
<p>The International Volleyball Tournament, organized by the YMCA, is scheduled to start on the 20th of this month. It is understood that the All-China Athletic Federation only received an invitation letter from the YMCA on the 19th and felt that the time was too short and inconvenient to immediately select a Chinese representative team. Furthermore, few Chinese people have joined the YMCA competition this year, and the players are not familiar with the American competition rules and playing styles. For the above reasons, they will not form a team to participate in the competition this year. As for the current participants, they are the China United Team, and not the official Chinese team.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read the news about the International Volleyball Tournament in your column, which mentioned that the Chinese team would be organized by Zheng Yiquan and others. The organization and selection of the Chinese team is related to international honor and should be presided over by the sports authorities. I do not dare to initiate or have the authority to organize. I am afraid it will cause misunderstandings, so I specifically request that you publish a letter to correct the error. Sincerely, Zheng Yi, March 18.</p>

<h3>1936 World Tennis Rankings</h3>
<p>Since it is uncertain whether the World Open Tennis Championships for both professionals and amateurs will be held in the near future, the following rankings include both professional and amateur tennis players, based on their performance last year.</p>
<p>Most experts agree that Vines is the most graceful player in the world today, with Perry being the closest second. Vines, when still an amateur, possessed a skill that was clearly superior to Perry's, and there is no reason to believe that his experience competing against players like Tilden would make his competition dull.</p>
<p>Due to his excellent performance in the Davis Cup and his qualification for the Wimbledon final, Kramm should be ranked third. German Hans Neussein is one of the most underestimated players, ranked fourth. He has repeatedly made it difficult for Tilden to parry, as Tilden himself can attest. Last July, at Southport in England, Neussein defeated Cochet in straight sets to win the championship. This competition included outstanding professionals, with the exception of Vines. Budge is ranked fifth due to his excellent competition results both domestically and abroad. In the national championships, he almost defeated Perry, and in their last match, before Perry became a professional, Budge defeated Perry.</p>
<p>Ranking Tilden sixth is inviting a lot of criticism. Tilden, at his peak, displayed the most graceful tennis technique the world had ever seen, and can still defeat Vines in an occasional match today. However, although this veteran's shots are sufficiently sophisticated, his legs and energy are not enough for a five-set match.</p>
<p>Austin is ranked seventh. Except for his loss to Quist in the Davis Cup, he has a rare Davis Cup record that is enough to list him above his conquerors. Quist is the Australian champion, close to Austin. Last season, he repeatedly defeated his partner Crawford. His skill is constantly improving. In the Wimbledon final, he defeated Aram 11-9 in the fifth set to win the Davis Cup for Australia.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top ten are Crawford in ninth place and Frenchman Cochet in tenth place. There are three or four outstanding professionals who can defeat Budge, Austin, Crawford, or Quist, but these players (such as Karelozeluh, Martin Pala, and Vinnie Richard) have not often participated in important competitions in recent years, competitions that every famous player must attend.

<h3>Shanghai Library Association Held its Ninth Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chairman Zha Xiu Gave the Opening Speech; Zha Xiu, Hong Kui, and Others Were Elected as Committee Members</p>
<p>The ninth annual meeting of the Shanghai Library Association was held at the Shanghai Central Library at 2 p.m. yesterday. Over one hundred members attended. Chairman Zha Xiu gave the opening speech. Zha Xiu, Hong Kui, and others were elected to the executive and supervisory committees. A visit to the city library was also conducted. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Zha Xiu (Fu Da), Hong Da, He Jiyu (City Library), Ouyang Jing (Hongying), Zhang Darui (Mingfu), Qin Xibei (Shanghai Business), Tang Menggao (Guanghua), Xia Zonghu (Liangcai), Gao Zhisheng (Daxia), Xu Huairen (Tongji), Qian Cuncun (Jiaotong), Weng Xuanxiu (Dagongbao), Wang Jiashu (Minli), Cui Dexi (International), Li Weiyue (Yuedong), Yang Xizhang (Shanghai University), Yu Youxin (Soochow), Song Bingqin (Province), Wei Yixin (Tongji), Lü Shaoyu (Ying), Tang Zengxuan (Minguang), Li Qingfan (Minli), Feng Xian (Shanghai North), Huang Jingwan (Shancun), Lin Side (Shanghai Business), Chen Hongfei (City Library), Cao Peizi, representative of the City Party Department, and Xu Manxin, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau. Chairman Zha Xiu, master of ceremonies Huang Jingwan, and recorder Chen Hongfei performed the ceremonies as required.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>He briefly stated that the Shanghai Library Association had been established for thirteen years, during which time everyone had worked hard to advance the association's affairs. Today, it is a great honor to hold the ninth annual meeting at the City Library and to visit the various facilities of the City Library. He felt particularly interested that today coincides with the Shanghai Festival to discuss the progress of the Shanghai Library Association, and he thought that the advancement of the Greater Shanghai Plan must have the establishment of excellent libraries. Foreign cities have very complete libraries. To develop Greater Shanghai, we must all work hard to build extremely complete libraries so that citizens of all levels can have a place to seek wisdom. For example, the libraries in Beiping focus on two types: one is focused on workers, and the other is focused on citizens. They have a spirit of mutual assistance in all aspects of the library. If one party focuses on workers, then the other parties will contribute books on worker knowledge to the first party for mutual adjustment. It is best that our Shanghai libraries also follow this example. At the same time, it is hoped that everyone will transform the library itself from management-oriented to commercial-oriented. In the past, library staff only knew how to preserve books. Now, it is hoped that everyone must promote the names of books to the outside world. For example, citizens who want to study national defense geography, science, and other books should be introduced and promoted, so that the "goods" in the library can be "sold" to citizens, and not just stay in a dull working environment. This would be fortunate. Then, Director Hong delivered a welcome speech, followed by speeches from representatives of the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Re-election of Staff</h3>
<p>Lin Sde, Hong Kui, Yang Xizhang, Cha Xiu, Lu Shaoyu, Xu Ze, Weng Xuanxiu, Huang Jingwan, Yu Youxin, Song Bingqin, and Chen Hongfei were elected as executive committee members.

<h3>Zhejiang Library Adds Books</h3>
<p>The Zui Li Series and Shi Yuan Series have been collected by the library one after another.</p>
<p>The printing department attached to the Zhejiang Provincial Library in Hangzhou was reorganized from the former Zhejiang Official Book Bureau and has a history of seventy years. The current collection of official bureau and subsequent carvings, as well as various academic masterpieces donated and deposited by various parties, has reached more than 175,000 blocks. The printed books exceed 200 kinds (counting the sub-items of the series, it has reached more than 500 kinds), which are circulated at home and abroad and are well-known in the book forest. In the past four or five years, the museum has been committed to preserving local literature and assisting in academic advancement, and has devoted considerable efforts to collecting old engraved blocks and has formulated reward donation deposit measures. Since 1932, those who have donated to the museum successively include the Wulin Anecdotes Series and the posthumous works of Wulin philosophers donated by Ding's Eight Thousand-Volume Building, the Continued Jinhua Series donated by Hu Jiqiao of Yongkang, the Yongjia Series deposited by Sun's Yuhai Building in Ruian, Sun of Anhui's reprinted Song Dynasty Four Books, and Feng of Cixi's deposited Jiang Ximing's Complete Works are all famous national studies, and other scattered donations total no less than 20,000 blocks of books. It is known that when the museum held the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition last winter, all parties expressed their sympathy and knew that the museum's method of preserving books was very secretive. For several months since the news of the wide printing and the return of famous book plates, there have been three more cases: ㊀ The Zui Li Series was compiled and published by Jin Rongjing of Pinghu, and his younger brother Qian Sun (named Zhao Fan) continued to publish it. The museum had been seeking it for many years, and at the end of last year, it was consulted by Lu Zhongxiang and Lu Qingcheng, and all the more than 600 picture plates have been deposited. ㊁ Shi Yuan Series is a painting compiled and published by Zhang Shiming (Junheng) of Wuxing. The collection includes the posthumous works of the former sages of the lake. It is now in the Shanghai residence of Zhang Qinbo, the son of the philosopher. Zhang wrote a letter voluntarily donating it. The museum sent staff to collect it. A total of 8,187 book plates were also transported to the museum for printing and sale in March. The transmission of sparseness is particularly rare and is highly valued by the book forest. ㊂ The Six Records of Siming in the Song and Yuan Dynasties also belonged to the museum at the beginning of this month. The Siming Song Records include the Qiandao Siming Tuji, Baoqing Siming Zhi, Kaiqing Siming Continued Zhi, and the Yuan Records include the Yanyou Siming Zhi. To Zheng Siming Continued Zhi Dade Changguo Prefecture Tujia, Xianfeng Jian Yong Confucian Xu Liuquan (Shi Su) visited and obtained a lone copy, proofread and published it into a book, a total of eighty-three volumes, which were regarded as treasures by the people at the time, but it was a pity that the printing was very scarce. The museum tried to find a way to consult with the philosopher Xu Fusun and agreed to deposit 1,349 of his book plates in the museum and sent staff to Yong to collect them. The above three types have been established by the museum and the original owner to sign an agreement and each hold a copy. The first two types can be printed immediately, but the Siming Six Records plate has been sealed for a long time and there are many missing plates and damage. The construction and repair are now underway. Among them, the Baoqing Zhi originally had ten pages of maps. At that time, Xu did not see it, so it was not engraved. This time, ten pages of the original map of the lone copy were also found and engraved, so that it is more complete than Xu's publication. It is heard that it will be sold at a special price as soon as the plate repair is completed. The method has now been determined and can be prepared for archiving. I think public and private collectors pay attention to local chronicles and extravagant and will want to recruit them. It is heard that the museum is currently seeking old engraved book plates in many ways, especially paying attention to the works of local sages and county series in Zhejiang Province. Donations and deposits are welcome, with a view to widely printing and disseminating them to benefit scholars.</p>

By 1:00 PM, the number of people in the museum reached more than 3,000 people, and the entire museum was packed. The museum had to put the audience in in batches, but the order was excellent. In addition, because the museum had made preparations in advance, the Central and Shenjiahang police substations of the city also sent police officers to the scene to maintain order and prevent temporary incidents. It was found that the number of visitors to the museum on that day was 8,852 Chinese and 1,029 foreigners, which is the highest record since the museum opened in January this year.

<p>Labor Exhibition Opens Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The labor exhibition of public and private primary and secondary schools sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was held at Xicheng Primary School on Penglai Road yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. At the same time, the exhibition was opened to the public for three days. A total of 53 schools participated in this exhibition, with more than 12,000 works. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Situation</p>
<p>The venue is located in Xicheng Primary School, at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Penglai Road. There are large banners. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM yesterday. Director Pan of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Section Chief Jiang, Zhang Yongchun, Yu Jifan and other guests, and more than 300 representatives of teachers and students from various schools attended. Chairman Director Pan, Master of Ceremonies Yuan Zengyu, Recorder Wang Gongxia, performed the ceremony as usual. First, Chairman Director Pan delivered a speech, followed by speeches by Section Chief Jiang Yu Jifan, etc., and then the meeting adjourned immediately. The exhibition opened to the public at 9:30, and the audience was very crowded.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Director Pan delivered the opening speech, which briefly stated that today is Shanghai Festival, and it was also decided by the Shanghai Municipal Mayor according to the suggestion of the Municipal Council that March 21st every year is Shanghai Festival. The meaning is to hope that on this day, regardless of occupation or region, all citizens of Shanghai will show the enthusiastic spirit of unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance. At the same time, this festival is used to encourage industry, agriculture, commerce, and learning, such as holding exhibitions of agricultural products, handicrafts, horticulture, potential works, and other various exhibitions. The mayor's intention is to promote the improvement of customs on this festival, because the transformation of social customs is very important. To have a new country, there must first be a new society. To have good politics, there must first be a good society. Therefore, reforming social customs is an important task. On the one hand, we must eliminate bad and outdated things, and at the same time, we must come up with new things that are in line with the times to replace them. In terms of form, we must reform them, and in terms of spirit, we must purify them. In this way, we can achieve the purpose of transforming customs. For example, the welcoming of gods and festivals in Shanghai is superstitious and contains feudal colors, and should not be held in modern times. However, in the past agricultural economic era, after the farmers completed their annual work, they thought of thanking the gods, and at the same time, after a year of hard work, they thought of finding a day to be happy, so there was the matter of welcoming gods and festivals, so it also had considerable significance at that time. The mayor's intention is to ban all such festivals, and on this day of Shanghai Festival, everyone should do meaningful festivals. Festivals do not necessarily have to welcome gods, such as the parade of national goods, and the sports parade of the Soviet Union, which can also be competed. Therefore, we must take the good things that can encourage progress in knowledge, physical strength, industry, agriculture, and commerce, and think of ways to hold them on Shanghai Festival. If one day is not enough, even a week is possible. However, because preparations were not enough this year, it can be used as a propaganda year to let the citizens know, and it will be lively next year. The labor exhibition held today is one of the various exhibitions that the mayor hopes to hold on Shanghai Festival. If preparations are not enough, of course, it cannot meet the ideal. A total of five municipal middle schools and normal schools and thirty-six municipal primary schools, four private middle schools and normal schools, and eight private primary schools participated in the preparation from the 16th to notify the schools. Vocational schools did not participate, so there were a total of 53 schools. The number of products, 2,407 from municipal middle schools and normal schools, 8,304 from municipal primary schools, 734 from private middle schools and normal schools, 1,287 from private primary schools, totaling 12,732. The order of display, first primary school, then middle school normal school, a total of ten rooms for municipal primary school, one large room for private primary school, four rooms for municipal middle school normal school, two rooms for private middle school normal school, a total of nineteen rooms. Finally, everyone should pay attention to why the education exhibition is held first. Labor, because we now feel that education must be in line with life, and we hope that the education given by the schools and received by the students must be in line with the skills needed for their future practical life and the skills to obtain their original life, such as knowledge and physical strength are important, but labor is particularly important. Labor is a necessary condition for life. A few years ago, we heard the sentence "He who does not work, neither shall he eat", the meaning of which is that to live, one must first labor. This theory comes from abroad. China has "Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others." This concept has been passed down, thinking that it is not necessary to labor, but there is a folk saying that whether it is agriculture, industry, or handicraft, going out to work is called making a living, which can prove that living requires labor. China is also the same. The so-called work is labor work, abbreviated as labor. So labor is life, life is hard work, so the labor exhibition is held first to check whether students have learned life skills in addition to book knowledge. If so, it is education that meets the needs of modern times. We now attach importance to labor, that is, to change the idea of ​​only emphasizing book knowledge in the imperial examination era. Therefore, in the first year of the Shanghai Festival, holding this conference is to instruct the general society to know the new meaning of education. After everyone visits, how to encourage and supervise progress will not lose the significance of holding it.</p>
<p>Speeches Summary</p>
<p>㊀ Section Chief Jiang's speech briefly stated that today is Shanghai Festival, and it is also the day when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai. Because of the arrival of the revolutionary army, obstacles have been cleared, so we are here today to hold a gathering, and do not forget to clear obstacles and seek national equality. Education is life, it is realistic education, and education cannot be separated from reality. If there is a major enemy in front of us, we have a hypothetical goal in front of us, and labor should also have a hypothetical goal. We must have front-line education and rear-defense education, so that students are not on the front line, but in the rear. ㊁ Yu Jifan's speech briefly stated that now everyone is talking about the economic recession of the country and the depression of social phenomena. Under this status quo, the education sector should pay attention to production education, which can be remedied by production. However, production cannot be separated from labor. Therefore, today's conference is to pay attention to saving the social depression. Everyone must work hard. The purpose of labor education is to first cultivate children's labor, skills, and cooperative spirit, second to develop children's design ability, third to inspire children's interest and ability in production, and fourth to enable children to have the knowledge and ability to improve their own lives.</p>

<p>Unprecedented Grand Occasion at the Civic Education Center</p>
<p>The Municipal Civic Education Center held an expanded commemorative meeting yesterday for Shanghai Festival, in order to vigorously improve the lives of citizens and transform bad customs. The lecture hall was colorful and brand new, with about a thousand people participating. Chairman Xu Zexiang, recorder Wang Chunxi, Liu Ruichang, after leading the ceremony, gave a brief and concise report, briefly stating that today is the first year, the first day, the first Shanghai Festival, and it is also the first day when the National Revolutionary Army recovered Shanghai. In order to commemorate Shanghai's revolutionary baptism and to improve the lives of Shanghai citizens and transform customs, Shanghai Festival was born in response to this. Today we commemorate Shanghai Festival, and we should follow the instructions of Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government, encourage agriculture, encourage industry, encourage commerce, and encourage learning. Everyone should be loyal to their duties in the future, in order to improve their lives, be enterprising, and be promising, full of vigor, and reform the bad customs of welcoming gods and festivals in the past, grasp the times, stand on the line of the times, and embark on the bright road of a new era and a new China. After the report, Dr. Zhang Yuanruo, a celebrity in this city, gave a speech (detailed words are being sorted out), briefly stating that we commemorate Shanghai Festival, which has four major meanings: 1. The meaning of seeing revolution, the content includes the commemoration of recovery, the starting point of building a new China, and the beginning of modernization progress. 2. The meaning of society, such as the social construction of the Municipal Government in recent years, changing politics must first change customs, improve customs, promote new life, etc. 3. The meaning of education, the content includes, first, entertaining education in happiness, second, the national life of boredom, third, breaking superstition, fourth, enlightenment movement of lively, energetic, optimistic and upward, etc. 4. The meaning of self-reliance, the general idea is that welcoming gods and festivals are all worship of divine power, relying on the psychology of relying on heaven. In the future, we must awaken the spirit of self-reliance, such as Mayor Wu's announcement to us to encourage agriculture, encourage industry, encourage commerce, and encourage learning, etc. All our citizens should follow them consistently, in order to improve bad lives as soon as possible and transform bad habits as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The whole city celebrates by raising flags</h3>
<p>Due to time constraints this year, a large-scale celebration could not be held, but the Municipal Government had issued a notice to the whole city in advance to raise flags to celebrate, in order to arouse the attention of citizens. Therefore, yesterday, all agencies, schools, groups, industrial and commercial firms, and residents along the street all raised net flags to celebrate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Expanding the Celebration Next Year</p>
<p>The method of celebrating "Shanghai Festival" was previously discussed by the Municipal Government convening representatives of various groups, and it was decided to hold six exhibitions in separate areas: agricultural products, handicrafts, labor, hygiene, horticulture, and commemorative events for the restoration, as well as other celebrations such as competitions and airplane performances. However, because preparations were not enough, all of them could not be held. However, Mayor Wu believes that promoting Shanghai Festival is enough to eliminate bad habits and achieve the effect of transforming customs, and plans to organize the Shanghai Festival Committee from this year, gathering all relevant parties, and actively preparing in accordance with the purpose of encouraging agriculture, encouraging industry, encouraging commerce, and encouraging learning, so that Shanghai Festival will have a grand celebration next year.</p>

<h3>The German Government Bestows the Grand Decoration of Honor on Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>The German Consul General, representing his government, held the bestowal ceremony yesterday.</p>
<p>The German government, in recognition of Mayor Wu's assistance to German nationals in Guangzhou during his tenure as Commissioner of Public Safety in 1925, and in gratitude for his efforts to maintain order during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, which ensured the safety of German residents and their property, has awarded Mayor Wu a First-Class Red Cross Decoration of Honor, along with a certificate. The award ceremony, conducted by the German Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, on behalf of the German government, took place at his official residence yesterday at 1:00 PM. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, and Secretary Tang were invited to a luncheon, accompanied by senior consular staff and prominent members of the German community in Shanghai. During the luncheon, the German Consul General and Mayor Wu exchanged toasts to the health of their respective heads of state. After the luncheon, the German Consul General delivered an address before presenting the medal to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu also gave a reply. The guests departed in high spirits. The text of both addresses is recorded below.</p>
<p>Address at the Bestowal Ceremony</p>
<p>Consul General Kriebel, in his address, stated: "Ten years ago today, namely, March 21, 1927, corresponding to the sixteenth year of the Republic, at a time when the cause of the Chinese National Revolution, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang, was sweeping across the country with victories everywhere, the Chinese National Revolutionary Army entered Shanghai on that very day. We, the German people, wish on this day to commemorate the benevolent policies Your Honor implemented towards the German community during your tenure as Commissioner of Public Safety in Guangzhou in 1925. At the time of the Shameen Incident, labor unrest was rampant, boycotts were fierce, and local disturbances lasted for several years. Your Honor, without shirking difficulties, resolutely took responsibility to protect the lives and property of German nationals residing in Dongshan, Guangzhou. The German community remains grateful for this great achievement. On January 6, 1932, amidst the exigencies of the situation, Your Honor was appointed Mayor of Shanghai. On January 7, you were sworn into office. Our German residents in Shanghai were greatly pleased and encouraged, as recalling the events in Guangzhou, they could not help but feel even more gratified. The difficulties Your Honor has encountered in Shanghai, a city of great international character situated within Chinese territory and existing in a uniquely special situation, are well-known. However, Your Honor has been able to ensure security, maintain order, and organize matters in a systematic way. I, on behalf of our head of state and our government, wish to express our gratitude and admiration to Your Honor. After the January 28th Incident, German merchants, scholars, and residents of all occupations in Shanghai were spared from major disturbances and were able to live and work in peace, all thanks to Your Honor's protection. Your Honor's guarantee of security, maintenance of order, and systematic approach enabled the preservation of the lives and property of our German residents in Shanghai. Your Honor's great achievements are exceptionally admirable. Today, I am deeply honored to present to Your Honor our First-Class Red Cross Decoration of Honor and its certificate. I wish Your Honor a long tenure as Mayor of Shanghai, where you may fully realize your grand ambitions. As I am about to return to my country, I take this opportunity to bid Your Honor a temporary farewell. I previously served as a military advisor in Your esteemed country, and now, for several years, have been Consul General in Shanghai. Your country's enduring civilization and the construction of a new China have filled me with longing and admiration. I hope to return to Your esteemed country after my leave. This is my sincere hope and prayer."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Reply</p>
<p>"Today, I am deeply honored and grateful to receive the First-Class Red Cross Decoration of Honor and its certificate from Consul General Kriebel on behalf of the German government. Furthermore, I am deeply humbled by Consul General Kriebel's generous praise. This decoration symbolizes the friendly relations between China and Germany. I hope that Consul General Kriebel will convey my sincere gratitude to the head of your country and your government for their kindness. China is in the process of revolutionary construction. As evidenced by the experiences of various countries in their revival, there is much need for the cooperation and assistance of friendly nations. Consul General Kriebel previously served as a military advisor in our country, assisting our leader, Chairman Chiang, with outstanding achievements. I deeply admire him. Consul General Kriebel has been in Shanghai for many years and has contributed greatly to the promotion of Sino-German relations. His cooperation and sincerity towards me will be remembered forever. As Consul General Kriebel takes leave to return to his country, I am filled with reluctance. How can I express my feelings? I can only wish him a safe journey and sincerely hope that he will return to our country soon, so that we may continue and develop our past cooperation and friendship."</p>

The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Farewell from Various Parties</p>
<p>Mr. Brenan and his wife arrived at the Gonghexiang wharf on East Broadway Road yesterday morning to board the Canadian Empress of Canada.

The consular corps has now designated the Consul General of Norway, Mr. Ohr, to succeed him as doyen of the consular corps.</p>
<p>Farewell from Chinese and Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Mr. Brenan has been in China since 1905, serving in China for thirty-one years. He has very harmonious relations with various parties, both Chinese and foreign. Mayor Wu and others, in addition to personally going to the ship to bid farewell, also presented flower baskets to add to the farewell ceremony. Commander Yang also presented a piece of Hunan embroidery, a "Crouching Tiger," as a memento. In addition, Director-General of the Public Works Department Arnold also sent a letter to Mr. Brenan on behalf of the Board of Directors of the PWD, stating: "Your cooperation with our department during your time as a British Consul in China, and the friendliness of the relationship, is truly unforgettable. We sincerely express our gratitude and wish you and your wife success and happiness in the future."</p>

This time, Mr. Brenan was promoted and returned to his country. In addition to specially hosting a farewell banquet at the International Hotel, yesterday afternoon, Mr. Yang personally accompanied his secretary Sun Liping to the dock to see him off, wishing Mr. Brenan a smooth journey and hoping that he would be promoted to ambassador in the future and come to China again. Mr. Brenan replied modestly and hoped that Commander Yang could visit England, etc. The mood was enthusiastic. Finally, they wished each other good health and bid each other farewell.</p>
<h3>Customs Anti-Smuggling Personnel Issue Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Ronin Smuggle and Commit Violence; Hope Government Will Provide Armed Force and Expects Enthusiastic Assistance from All Circles</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Japanese ronin secretly loaded copper coins worth ten thousand yuan for export on the morning of the 20th. Because customs officials prevented it, they committed violence and injured seven customs officials on the spot. It is now known that the ship carrying the goods was the "Taiyo Maru", not the "Shanghai Maru". In view of the escalating smuggling and violence by Japanese ronin, the Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling personnel held a meeting yesterday to discuss solutions and issued a declaration stating: "In the past year, customs officials have clashed with Japanese ronin more than a dozen times over smuggling incidents at the Japanese wharves in Shanghai. In these dozen or so clashes, some of us have been beaten until our heads were broken and bleeding, and some have had our fingers broken. Now it is getting more and more serious every day. Almost customs personnel can no longer perform their duties at Japanese wharves. For example, in several incidents that have occurred this month, two or three times the smuggled copper coins that had been seized by the customs were forcibly taken away at the wharf by personnel from the Japanese consulate. On one occasion, a small number of customs officials were surrounded by a large number of ronin, losing their freedom of movement. On one occasion, a tax police officer, along with the smuggled goods seized, was kidnapped to the police station by the ronin, and the smuggled goods were taken away by the Japanese consulate. We now feel that the Japanese wharves in Shanghai are no longer Chinese territory. Since April of last year, in order to strengthen the management of imported goods and improve efficiency, the customs implemented a new system of wharf warehouse management. Merchants from Britain and the United States, as well as wharf companies, have sincerely accepted the customs' measures and implemented them one after another. This new system is a major blow to professional smugglers. However, Japanese merchants and various wharf companies, under the pretext of unfounded reasons, refused to obey orders. As a result, the new system of tens of thousands of yuan in annual administrative fees for customs has been completely destroyed and nothing has been gained. We sincerely feel that it is necessary for China and Japan to have economic cooperation, but we believe that the premise of economic cooperation must be that Japanese people can respect the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of China. We hope that our business community and people from all walks of life will not forget these customs officials who are struggling daily under the iron rulers and short daggers of the ronin, and give formal advice to the economic delegation from Japan this time. We further hope that Mr. Kodama Kenji and his companions, who are coming to China this time, will go to the Huishan Wharf, where Japanese ronin are rampant, when they take the boat back to their country, and inquire about the truth of the unbridled behavior of Japanese ronin at the wharf. At the same time, we should use the Eastern maxim quoted by Chairman Chiang, 'Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself,' to pay tribute to Mr. Kodama Kenji and his party. If Japan is willing to consider international integrity, accept our advice, and automatically deal with the organized behavior of these ronin, we will have no objection to economic cooperation between China and Japan based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Otherwise, in order to protect national sovereignty, to protect the lifeline of finance, and the tax revenue of national industry and commerce, we can only give a head-on blow to this shameless smuggling. We are willing to sacrifice, we are willing to go to the front line of anti-smuggling and fight to the death, but we cannot fight like this with bare hands. We hope that the government will arm us. This is an issue for the entire nation. We hope that people from all walks of life across the country will give enthusiastic assistance to our wishes and demands. This is hereby declared."</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Mission Member Fujiyama Hosted Banquet Yesterday to Exchange Views on Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>The mission has formally completed its banquets in Shanghai; Kodama is scheduled to return home on the 26th; Discussions over the past few days have not yielded any concrete results</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, apart from attending the banquet hosted by the Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying yesterday noon, the Japanese Economic Mission has formally completed its banquets in Shanghai. The members of the mission began to act freely from yesterday onwards. Fujiyama Aiichiro invited Chinese sugar industry leaders Zhou Zuomin and Qian Xinzhi, among others, to a banquet, while others hosted a banquet for the mission in a private capacity last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Reception</p>
<p>The Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying hosted a banquet for the Japanese Economic Mission at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road at 12:30 PM yesterday. The attendees included the head of the mission, Kodama Kenji, and all the members of the mission. In addition, there were the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai Kawai, Secretaries of the Japanese Embassy Tajiri and Soga, Commercial Officer Iwai, Consul Fukui, leaders of the Japanese industrial and commercial circles Funatsu, Yoshida, Yamamoto, Boku, Ueda, Hatsuzuka, the Mayor of this city Wu Tiecheng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhou Jue, Deputy Director Zhao Tiezhang, leaders from all walks of life Yu Qiaqing, Zhou Zuomin, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Yefeng, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xiuzhi, Shao Yulin, Tang Shoumin, Yu Zuoting, Wu Yunzhai, Zhou Wenbin, and others, more than fifty people. Wang Pengsheng, former Counselor of the Embassy in Japan, Secretary Huang Bodu, and Zhou Jue, Zhao Tiezhang, and others were responsible for the reception. Short speeches were made to show welcome, and toasts were raised to each other. There were no speeches. The banquet ended in high spirits at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Fujiyama's Banquet</p>
<p>Fujiyama Aiichiro, Director of the Japan Sugar Industry Federation, hosted a banquet for Chinese sugar industry leaders Zheng Zenan and others at the International Hotel at 12:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on increasing sugar trade. During the banquet, Fujiyama said in his speech: "Today, I am hosting this banquet for you, and I am very honored and happy that you have all come together in your busy schedules. Furthermore, I have been very busy in China, seeking friendship between the two countries, so I went to Nanjing and other places in your esteemed country, and I have not yet had the opportunity to visit you. I sincerely apologize. I am very grateful for your kindness over the years in promoting the products of our factory. I hope that you will continue to work hard in the spirit of past promotion. This is my hope, and I hope that our sugar merchants from both countries will work together to promote friendship and increase profits. I offer you a glass of wine and wish you all the best in your business development and health." Zheng Zenan, a representative of the sugar industry, replied: "Today, we, the sugar industry colleagues in Shanghai, are greatly grateful to Mr. Fujiyama from the Japan Sugar Manufacturing Factory for inviting us here and treating us to a grand banquet. At the same time, we are honored to hear your guidance and many great opinions. We also have great sympathy with the various points expressed and hoped for by Mr. Fujiyama, and we should work together to strive to implement Mr. Fujiyama's expectations. However, we feel that in order to achieve the goal of realizing our hopes, we must first seek a basis for our own goals. The so-called basis is that the existence of good feelings is an element of international trade, which need not be said. Mr. Fujiyama has long known this, but since the September 18th Incident, the people of our country have had no good feelings towards your country due to the enthusiasm of patriotic sentiments. However, our sugar industry colleagues, because of their long and deep relationship of 30 years of trade with sugar merchants in your country, have still restored old relations even though there have been occasional interruptions in business for a short time due to the sanctions of our people. This is nothing more than our repayment of the good friendship of your country's sugar merchants, and it is also our actual expression of love for your country's sugar merchants. Unexpectedly, in recent years, some of the measures taken by sugar merchants in your country have greatly disappointed us. That is, selling the produced sugar to smugglers in your country and promoting it in China through improper methods of dishonesty. This has caused great damage to our business. The agents of sugar merchants in your country, such as Mitsui, Fuhoyu, etc., have also been affected. Therefore, if such a trend is not stopped, it is tantamount to killing our business. Therefore, our good feelings towards sugar merchants in your country have been somewhat diminished. If feelings can become deeper with each passing day, then trade is easy to increase. If you go against this, it is tantamount to trying to find fish in trees. I have heard people from your country say that this is due to the high sugar tax in our country. We have no objection to this, but the current tax rate in our country is at a low-to-medium level compared to the sugar taxes in various countries around the world. There are even countries with tax rates that are six or seven times higher than ours. I have never heard of any neighboring country smuggling and reducing tariffs, but the tariff is still over seven yuan if half is deducted, and there is still a huge profit from smuggling. Furthermore, no countries in the world have ever heard of reducing taxes to avoid smuggling because smuggling cannot be suppressed. Therefore, this statement is certainly wrong, and it is definitely not what we want. I think that Mr. Fujiyama is not only a leader in the sugar industry in Japan, but also bears the heavy expectations of society and the government. One word is heavier than nine tripods. This time, when he came to China to seek true economic cooperation between the two sides, we should not use empty words of communication to perfunctorily treat him, failing to live up to Mr. Fujiyama's good intentions of traveling across the ocean. I would like to take this opportunity to frankly inform you of what we want to say, so that it can actually achieve results. At the same time, we have great aspirations and are prepared to be taught by Mr. Fujiyama, who is knowledgeable and insightful, to discuss how to avoid smuggling, and we hope that Mr. Fujiyama will consider our plea. Hopefully, Sino-Japanese trade, not only in sugar products, but also in other goods, can be increased and developed. I would also like to borrow a glass of wine and toast together, wishing Mr. Fujiyama a smooth journey and happiness."</p>
<p>Private Receptions</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Tang Shoumin, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Zuomin, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others hosted a public banquet for the head of the mission, Kodama, and others at Liu Jisheng's residence at 675 Julada Road to show their friendly relations. The Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhou Jue, and all the directors of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association also participated. The banquet ended at around 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>About to Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>It is reported that, apart from Miyajima Seijiro and his entourage Sakurada Takeo, who went to Qingdao the day before yesterday, Kato Keijiro and Ohira Kenro are also scheduled to fly to Qingdao tomorrow morning. The head of the mission, Kodama, is scheduled to return home by boat on the 26th. Furthermore, mission members Shoji Otsukichi, Iio Ichiji, Toyota Risaburo, and Funatsu Tatsuichiro are scheduled to host a banquet at the Six Three Garden at 7:00 PM tonight to thank the Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying. According to the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, the economic problems discussed by the Japanese mission and the association in recent days have all been abstract discussions and have not yielded any concrete results.</p>
<h3>Formal Tibetan Representative Arrives Today</h3>
<p>Westan Gyatso</p>
<p>According to Shen Zhou She, since the central government sent Huang Musong as a special envoy to Tibet, the local government has been sending people to Beijing, but they have all been unofficial representatives. Now, in view of the fact that the central government and the border region are far apart, transportation is inconvenient, and estrangement is inevitable, Reting Rinpoche, the leader of the Tibetan local government, specially dispatched Westan Gyatso, the Great Khenpo of Lhasa, as a formal representative to Beijing to pay respects to the central authorities. Mr. Westan is from Qinghai and went to Tibet to study at a young age. He is a profound scholar and is especially proficient in sutras. He is now in his fifties. Many of his disciples work in Beijing. Mr. Westan set out east last month and will be able to pass through Shanghai and transfer to Beijing this morning. He does not intend to stay. The Central Party Headquarters specially dispatched section chief Li Yongxin, staff member Li Jinfu, head of the Tibetan Affairs Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Kong Qingzong, along with key members Ji Guoyi, Shen Ziyi, representative of the Ministry of Education Wang Kuiwu, and the Tibetan representative stationed in Beijing and Director of the Tibetan Office in Beijing Tudan Sangjie, along with their attendants, all came to Shanghai yesterday morning to welcome him and will accompany Mr. Westan to Beijing. It is also learned that the supervisors and commissioners Li Dan and Secretary Yang Zhifu, who were sent by the central government to welcome him, will also come today. It is also learned that Nanjing is also preparing to host him.</p>
<h3>工部局 Letter Responds to Real Estate Association Regarding Water Price Increase</h3>
<p>Based on the company's repeated requests and careful consideration, a decision was made. The Real Estate Association will hold a meeting in the coming days to continue their opposition.</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Municipal Council of the Public Concession recently responded to a letter from the Real Estate Association of this city, which inquired about the reasons for the water price increase. The letter stated: "Dear Sirs, We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 17th of this month regarding the issue of water price increases. This Bureau has studied the matter with the Water Company on several occasions and has repeatedly considered it. The Public Utilities Committee of this Bureau has put forward a discussion and decided to implement it. The process and reasons for the price increase are as follows:</p>
<p>Water prices within the Public Concession</p>
<p>Calculated at 75% of the original price. The Public Utilities Committee of this Bureau recently put forward the question of this discount for consideration. It was found that the 75% discount was implemented from April 1935. By the end of that year, both this Bureau and the Water Company believed that the local economy was depressed and that water prices should not be increased. The Company also intended to postpone the modification of water prices for one year and wait until the currency system promulgated by the Chinese government was more effective before re-examining the matter. Therefore, the water prices for 1936 were the same as those for 1935. However, it was mutually understood at the time that if the situation required a modification of the 75% discount, this Bureau and the Company would negotiate a change. Near the end of 1936, the Company submitted a request to this Bureau to change the water price to 85%. The Public Utilities Committee and this Bureau then</p>
<p>Considered in Detail</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Company submitted details of its estimated expenditures for 1937. The Company replied on December 29th of the previous year, stating that the directors of the Company believed that if expenditures were reduced, the continued and safe supply of water would be jeopardized. It also stated that the Company had previously declared that in many areas, savings in water supply had often resulted in epidemics, causing loss of life, and fires, causing property damage. On January 11th of this year, the Public Utilities Committee held a meeting and discussed this matter again. The Chief of the Finance Department suggested changing the Company's proposed 85% to 80%. The Chief believed that even with the 80% change, the Company's business would still be in deficit and should be compensated from the Company's reserve fund. Mr. Bielson, the Company's Chief Engineer and General Manager, attended the meeting and answered questions regarding</p>
<p>Company Expenses</p>
<p>Mr. Bielson stated that the main reason for the increase in budgeted expenses was the lower exchange rate compared to 1935, as well as the recent installation of a large number of water meters. Furthermore, a new machine would have to be installed this year. One committee member stated that the average water price currently paid by users within the concession was lower than that in the city of Shanghai or the French Concession. Mr. Bielson said that if calculated at 80%, the water price in the Public Concession would be almost the same as in the Chinese area, but still much lower than in the French Concession. Finally, Mr. Bielson stated that it would be best to revise the water price before the end of this year because the Shanghai Real Estate Owners Association had strongly requested the Company to install individual water meters for Chinese-style houses. This would reduce water usage, and the cost per unit of water used would increase. Furthermore, the Company would have to incur additional expenses for installing water meters, so the water price paid by users would inevitably increase somewhat. If it is now agreed to change the water price to 85%, it may not be increased again in the future. However, this would benefit future users, but would inevitably cause some losses for current users. After discussion, the Public Utilities Committee</p>
<p>Recommended to the Board of Directors</p>
<p>As follows: (1) Approve the Shanghai Water Company to charge users based on water meter readings at 80% of the original price, starting from February 1st of this year. The Company promises to strive for thrift within the realm of possibility. (2) When the situation changes and the discount rate needs to be modified, it may be appropriately modified with the consent of this Bureau. (3) The Company's expenditures between 1931 and 1937 have increased sharply. This Bureau, seeing this, has not approved the Company's proposed change to 85%. (4) The issue of future water meter installation should be studied in detail by the relevant departments of this Bureau in conjunction with Company staff. The Board of Directors approved the Public Utilities Committee's previous recommendations at a meeting on January 20th of this year. The Company also expressed its agreement.</p>
<p>Meeting to Oppose</p>
<p>After receiving the reply from the Municipal Council, the Real Estate Association believes that the reasons for the price increase proposed by the Water Company and the reasons recommended by the Public Utilities Committee to the Board of Directors are insufficient at a time when the market has not yet recovered. It has now been decided to continue the opposition and a meeting will be convened in the coming days to discuss the next steps.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Electric Company to Increase Capital by Four Million</h3>
<p>Shareholders' meeting decided yesterday to increase the amount fully in the next two years, expanding business area to Caohejing, Pu Song</p>
<p>Shanghai China Merchants Electric Company held its 20th shareholders' meeting at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road, Beijing Road, at 2:00 PM yesterday, and immediately passed a resolution to increase capital by four million yuan. The Datong News Agency reporter investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Shareholders Present</p>
<p>Shareholders present yesterday included Du Yuesheng, Gu Xinyi, Lu Bohong, Kuang Zhongmou, Wang Zhen, Huang Hanzhi, Liu Pinsan, Yao Yinpeng, Li Fengyi, Wang Zhicui, Wang Tiqun, Xu Fuhua, Chen Ligou, Shao Daren, Zhang Wenbin, Zhang Jingwan, Zhang Baoji, Li Feiqing, Li Shi Wan Shan, and more than one hundred others, accounting for 360,730 shares. Wang Yiting presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Business Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, Manager Lu Bohong first reported on the general outline of the 19th session, roughly saying: "Previously, the company's business had been gradually developing, resulting in insufficient power supply from the original power plant. Purchasing electricity from other companies and reselling it to users was not only restricted by others but also uneconomical. Therefore, at the shareholders' meeting in the 22nd year of the Republic, it was decided to build a new power plant on a self-purchased site in Pubin and order the latest boilers and larger capacity steam turbine generators in order to provide as much as possible to the needs of society without any shortages. However, since the new plant is under construction, it is urgent to prepare for sales. The company's business area is only in the South Shanghai area, and the scope is narrow, so there is no room for development. Therefore, on the one hand, we tried to sell to peer companies outside the business area. On the one hand, the whole area of Caohejing and half of the Pu Song area were submitted to the government to expand into the company's exclusive business area. The above plan has been reported last year. Subsequently, the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau transferred the order from the Shanghai Municipal Government to pay 130,000 yuan in national currency to the city treasury as the price for the exclusive operating rights for the expanded area. The company's board of directors authorized the manager to negotiate repeatedly, and the municipal government finally agreed to reduce it to 70,000 yuan. A franchise contract was signed with the municipal government in November, and the expansion of the area was announced." Lu reported to this point, and then divided the business conditions of the past year into two parts: electricity and transportation. The electricity part was divided into (A) the general situation of the new plant project, (B) poles and lines, (C) power distribution, (D) power generation, (E) power purchase, (F) power sales, and other six items. The transportation part was divided into (A) engineering and (B) business, and detailed reports were made separately. Then, Supervisor Zhang Wenbin reported (1) the balance sheet, (2) the property catalog, (3) the profit and loss statement, (4) the profit distribution, and (5) the comparative table of economic business and industrial conditions in the past two years.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>After the reporting matters were completed, the discussion immediately followed. (1) The proposal to increase capital was attached with an explanation: "The company's number of electricity users has been increasing year by year, and the power generation capacity has continued to increase, resulting in the original generator capacity being unable to meet demand. Purchasing electricity from other companies for resale to users is not only restricted by others but also too uneconomical. At the 17th shareholders' meeting in the 23rd year of the Republic, it was proposed to build a new power plant, and at the 18th shareholders' meeting in the 24th year of the Republic, it was reviewed to change the plan for building a new plant, and both were approved. However, since the construction of the new power plant began, the pound price has been rising without falling. It is estimated that the equipment such as turbine generators, boilers, and coal conveying pumps, steam pipes, and water pipes will cost more than 2,110,000 yuan in national currency. The construction projects such as pile driving, foundation factory buildings, and steel frames will cost about 400,000 yuan in national currency. This is the machinery that has been purchased and the construction that has been carried out, totaling 3,510,000 yuan in national currency. The machinery that has not yet been ordered and the construction projects that have not yet been carried out, such as the connection between the new and old plants, the new plant's cement engineering pumping room, water inlet equipment, installation of machine cooling and heating water equipment, and other expenses, will cost about 500,000 yuan in national currency. In addition, after the establishment of the new plant, in order to extend electricity to the expanded area, it is necessary to add a 33,000-volt high-voltage transmission line, including power distribution equipment, transformers, underground lines, electric poles, white materials, etc., which will cost about 500,000 yuan in national currency. In total, the completion of the new plant plan will cost more than 4,500,000 yuan. Based on the company's business development in recent years, it is estimated that the equipment such as various power distribution lines will need to be expanded at any time and place, all of which require funds. Although 2,000,000 yuan in equity has been increased in the 23rd year, it is still not enough for more than 1,500,000 yuan. Moreover, the company's fixed assets have exceeded the total capital by more than 2,500,000 yuan. The two funds require a total of hundreds of thousands of yuan in national currency, which urgently needs to be supplemented and consolidate the foundation. However, raising funds through branches is more complicated and difficult. It is now planned to recruit 400,000 shares at one time this year, totaling 4,000,000 yuan in national currency. Is it feasible? Please decide publicly." It was then resolved that 2,000,000 yuan in equity would be increased in the 16th year and 2,000,000 yuan in equity would be increased in the 27th year, totaling 4,000,000 yuan. (2) The proposal to amend the articles of association was attached with an explanation: "The company's original articles of association have become unsuitable for use due to the changes of the times, or the original articles must be supplemented in terms of wording and tone, or there is an urgent need to add special repairs due to the needs of the facts, so that the principals have something to rely on. All of these have been drafted by the board of directors to draw up a draft plan. Now the draft plan is read out item by item (read by Dong Gu Xinyi, and then revised and passed item by item."</p>
<p>Election of Supervisors</p>
<p>Before starting the vote to elect supervisors, the results of the vote showed that Zhang Wenbin, Li Zuhua, Jia Jiying, Jiao Xianglin, Zhuang Zhenjia, and other five people were elected for joint reappointment. After the election, the staff of the venue invited the shareholders to the second floor for tea and refreshments, and dispersed happily at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>American Helen Keller Will Come to China at the Invitation of the China Children's Welfare Association</h3>
<p>Foreign Commentary Agency in this city. This newspaper learned yesterday that American Helen Keller will come to China at the invitation of the China Children's Welfare Association. Ms. Keller was originally scheduled to depart from the United States in mid-April to Japan, where she is scheduled to stay for two months. The China Children's Welfare Association authorities decided to wait for Ms. Keller to arrive in Japan and then invite her to China. Currently, a special organizing committee is set up by Mrs. Freian and Mrs. Hanermilk, Mrs. New, Ms. Inter, etc., to be responsible for handling. According to Helen Keller, she was born in Alabama in 1880. After nineteen months, she became blind due to scarlet fever, and her hearing was also destroyed at the same time. Afterwards, with the help of teachers using the Braille system, she was able to read and type with care. After eight years of training, she was gradually able to speak. After that, she graduated from Radcliffe College and obtained a degree. Soon she became a writer and speaker. Her progress in speech and blindness is unprecedented in history. Even her literary achievements are superior to those of ordinary people. According to a survey by the International Association for the Prevention of Blindness, there are currently 3 million blind people in China, and an estimated 20 million people will become blind. There are an estimated 12 million people suffering from trachoma. Corneal disease is the biggest cause of blindness. Secondly, smallpox and venereal diseases also lead to blindness.</p>
<h3>Using Fake Checks to Swindle Huge Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Totaling more than 20,000 Gold, Xu Houyi is Accused</p>
<p>Xu Houyi, who lives at No. 42 Wufu Lane, Pudong, has been working at the British American Tobacco Company. He has some savings. Huang Yongchang, who lives at No. 17 Yuanfuli, Baoding Road, Tangshan Road, and is engaged in the business of selling yellow sand and stones, had a close friendship with Xu. Around May of last year, Huang used 26 checks from banks such as Jiaotong, Kengye, Siming, Nonggong, and China &amp; South Sea, with a total face value of 23,301 yuan, to discount them to Xu, saying that the checks were issued by major commercial firms. At that time, Xu refused because the amount was too large. After Huang repeatedly requested, Xu gave him the cash according to the amount. After the checks were due, Xu went to various banks to withdraw the money, but they were all returned by the banks because there were insufficient funds and the accounts had been closed. Xu then investigated and found that the account names on the checks were all Huang's aliases and were intended to defraud money. He then negotiated with him, but Huang did not show up and his whereabouts were unknown. Xu had no choice but to hire lawyer Zhang Fukang to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zhang for the crime of defrauding money, requesting that he be punished according to Article 335 of the Criminal Law and ordered to repay 23,301 yuan. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Second Criminal Court. Huang Yongchang was not summoned. After Judge Zhan questioned the plaintiff, he ordered a rescheduling and instructed the plaintiff to summon Huang Yongchang to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Bei Runsheng's Bodyguard Li Jinlong Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Unskilled in Flattery and Losing Favor with the Young Master, Further Stimulated and Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Li Jinlong, from Shandong, was 45 years old and worked as a bodyguard at the home of wealthy businessman Bei Runsheng, a Suzhou native, at No. 5 Baogongfang, Beiler Road, French Concession. He served as a gatekeeper and has been working for more than ten years. His home is at No. 38 Daodeli, Beile Road. His wife, Zhang, is 45 years old and from the same hometown as Li. They have a son, Gengrong, who is 7 years old.</p>
<p>By nature, he was bold and straightforward.</p>
<p>Serving in the Bei family, he was not good at flattery. Recently, he was treated coldly by the second young master because he was played with by his colleagues in front of the master, which made Li depressed. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Li returned home after leaving Bei's house. He saw that his wife Zhang was not at home. He asked his neighbors and learned that his seven-year-old son, Gengrong, had been lost while playing outside, and his wife was looking for him outside. Li learned the above situation and</p>
<p>Felt Stimulated</p>
<p>Sat in the room in a daze, speechless. Then, he took the cage out of the cage, threw it on the ground, and trampled the bird to death with his feet. In an instant, Li's wife, Zhang, found her son and returned home. Seeing Li's appearance, she knew that he must be upset and did not talk to him. Unexpectedly, Li had a moment of short-sightedness. He got up and went out. His wife was afraid that something would happen and followed him. He saw Li go straight to the master</p>
<p>Bei Runsheng's House</p>
<p>Zhang didn't take it seriously and went home to cook lunch. Unexpectedly, after Li arrived at Bei's house, he took the pistol he carried in his duties, went to the garden, and fired a shot at his right temple, committing suicide. The bullet entered his brain and he fell into a pool of blood. At that time, no one noticed. After half an hour, the servants of the Bei family suddenly did not see Li's trail and searched everywhere, and only then</p>
<p>In the Garden</p>
<p>Found Li lying wounded on the lawn in a pool of blood, couldn't help but be shocked, ran to tell the master, and reported to the French Patrol House by telegram, and immediately summoned an ambulance to rush to the scene and sent Li to Guangci Hospital, because the injury was in a critical part, it was too late to rescue him upon arrival at the hospital, he died of his breath. The Patrol House was notified, and the investigator investigated the cause of the death. One side sent the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch, waiting for the Second Special Court to send personnel for inspection today.</p>
<h3>Private Electricity Industry Federation Holds Diesel Users Meeting</h3>
<p>Plans to Form a Consumer Cooperative and First Set Up a Preparatory Office. Presume Shen Sifang and Other 25 People as Preparatory Committee Members</p>
<p>The National Private Electricity Industry Federation held a diesel user meeting yesterday to discuss the organization of a consumer cooperative and the establishment of a preparatory committee. The preparatory office will be set up in the Shanghai Communication Office of the Electricity Industry Federation to plan and proceed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Attendees</p>
<p>The number of promoters who attended included dozens of people such as Shen Sifang, Yu Qihan, Wu Shuying, Ye Yangwu (Tom Chengxin representative), and Han Yimin.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Shen Sifang was publicly elected as the chairman and Tom Chengxin recorded. First, the chairman reported on the reason for initiating the organization, roughly saying: "Since the two oil companies Asia and Meifu have been promoting diesel, the industry has seen it as cheap and simple, so they have switched from the original water-Ting engines to diesel engines as a substitute. However, the oil companies suddenly discovered that some people were using diesel to refine kerosene, so they had to deliberately increase the market price of diesel, and at the same time, they tightened sales quotas to crack down on it. I don't know that this policy is used by local managers, and diesel is regarded as a rare commodity. The daily needs of each power plant are often rejected, and it is comfortable and exhausted. The power plant is one of the national public utilities, and its responsibility is huge. If a proper plan is not made early, it will inevitably suffer great difficulties one day when the situation is urgent. Therefore, we initiated the establishment of a consumer cooperative to unite all power plants that use diesel as fuel and act in unison to seek a satisfactory solution." Then, Yu Qihan, Wu Shuying, Tom Chengxin, etc. reported,</p>
<p>Business Plan</p>
<p>The business plan is to establish a diesel consumer cooperative in Shanghai. All members of the association who use diesel as fuel can be members. All diesel used by members each year is purchased directly by the cooperative from Asia and Meifu Oil Companies. As for the surplus income in the cooperative, it will be proportionally divided according to the amount of transactions made by the members in the cooperative.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>(1) Publicly elected Shen Sifang and Tom Chengxin as the main and deputy directors of the preparatory committee, and all the representatives present were members of the preparatory committee. (2) The address of the meeting will be temporarily set up in the Shanghai Communication Office of the Electricity Industry Federation. (3) Hire experienced people to guide everything. The first preparatory meeting will be convened by Shen Sifang. (4) Presume representatives to negotiate with Asia and Meifu Oil Companies. (5) Sub-subscription</p>
<h3>Water Rats' Life</h3>
<p>Specializing in Stealing from Foreign Merchant Ships, Da Baozi and Others Will Eventually Escape the Law</p>
<p>Ji Thief Da Baozi is a Haizhou native who usually dresses up as a worker and specializes in prying open rooms on foreign merchant ships to steal property. He has a large number of followers, all living what they call the "water rat life." They have committed numerous crimes and have been dealt with by the authorities of the Chinese Concession more than ten times. After being unable to gain a foothold in Shanghai, they sneaked to Hong Kong to use their old tricks, and settled in two places, Xianghai Street and Yuanmao Street in Hong Kong. Recently, several of his accomplices committed crimes in Hong Kong and were imprisoned. With the wind tightening, Da Baozi and a few others had no choice but to sneak back to Shanghai to avoid the storm. However, due to the pressure of life, they colluded with four or five accomplices again on the afternoon of the 7th and 8th, took a boat to the British HAttunrgals berthed in Puxin, Yangshupu, pretended to be working, and took advantage of the crew's lunch to steal a telescope worth 300 yuan and a silver watch worth 20 yuan from the captain's room. They went ashore and fled. Da Baozi and others were greedy and insatiable for the theft of the ship. On the next day (19th) noon, they increased their party by three members and still went to the Xizai room door of the ship to pry the lock to open the door. It happened that the Xizai arrived and several criminals held up umbrellas to avoid the sight. Their contact skills were extremely agile and adaptable. The Xizai was questioned the day after the theft, and the bandits saw that things were exposed, so they got off the ship and fled. Three people, including Da Baozi, He Bingsheng, and Kong Zhaofa, were arrested on the spot and reported to the Customs Water Patrol House, and then sent detectives Wang Haiquan and Shi Ajin to take them back to confess that they had done this magic dozens or hundreds of times. A telescope worth 40 yuan was recovered at a pawnshop in Hongkou. After two days of chasing and arresting the remaining party members, they were not caught, and it was decided to send them to the local court today for questioning.</p>
<h3>Fire at Jihuatang Pharmacy Claims One Life</h3>
<p>Other Employees Safe and Sound</p>
<p>The Jihuatang Pharmacy on Yunnan Road caught fire on the night before last at 11:45 PM. The fire originated in the rear buildings, causing extensive damage. Upon receiving the alarm, all fire engines from the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze. The fire was discovered only five minutes prior. However, by then, the fire had already spread rapidly, far beyond expectations. As reported yesterday, only six people were rescued. The whereabouts of the other employees were unknown, leading to fears of a tragic outcome. However, by yesterday morning, firefighters searching through the debris found only one body under a bed on the upper floor of number 47. After identification, it was confirmed to be Gu Benjun, a 19-year-old apprentice from Zhenjiang employed at the pharmacy. No other bodies were found, indicating that the remaining employees had safely escaped the fire. The estimated value of the stock was 200,000 yuan, with a fire insurance coverage of 110,000 yuan. The cause of the fire is suspected to be an electrical fault, and the police are conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association Writes to Fish Market Requesting a Branch at Xiaodongmen</h3>
<p>Expressing Fishermen's Suffering and Requesting Improvements</p>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai sent a letter yesterday to the board of directors of the Shanghai Fish Market, stating: "We are writing to you based on a letter from Lou Guren and He Jiong, representatives of the Dinghai County Fishermen's Association, which states, 'The establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market was originally intended to promote Premier Sun's industrial plan. However, the relief of the fishing industry and the adjustment of production and sales are also essential principles. Since its establishment, the suffering felt by fishermen has become undeniable. We would like to briefly explain this and hope for your consideration: ❶ The unsuitable location of the fish market has resulted in weak sales. In the past, fish boats arriving in Shanghai would sell out in two days. Now, it takes five days. During these three extra days, the fish lose freshness, the cost of ice and salt increases, and the boat's expenses amount to dozens of yuan per day. Those who used to return to the fishing grounds two days later must now delay for three days. Consider the annual losses, and the numbers are staggering. ❷ Fish prices are unregulated and depend solely on supply and demand. Currently, supply exceeds demand, sales are sluggish, and prices are falling. The lack of freshness further contributes to the price decline, severely impacting the livelihoods of fishermen. ❸ Ice-preserved fish in barrels benefit from quick sales. Traditionally, they were sold immediately upon arrival. Now, they must be transferred from the docks to the fish market and can only be sold the next day. Despite the increased ice costs, it is difficult to maintain freshness. As a result, the business of barrel merchants in Dinghai has decreased by two-thirds compared to previous years. ❹ The number of fish vendors has gradually decreased due to various reasons. This is a definite fact. The imbalance between supply and demand is intensifying. Even those still in the trade must add the cost of transportation to the price of the fish, which effectively raises the cost of living for Shanghai's three million residents. The above points are just a brief overview. We are not criticizing the fish market but standing with the fishermen, we must emphasize the advantages and disadvantages in order to promote adoption. After discussion by our association, we believe that establishing a fish market branch at Xiaodongmen is a necessary requirement to benefit society and the people. Most importantly, the spring fishing season is approaching, and little yellow croaker boats are heading out to sea. If no measures are taken immediately, the production will increase, but the sales will be limited, and the catch will be useless. The little yellow croaker season is short, and production is high. Within twenty days, the catch of Dinghai alone will be over 200,000 dan (a unit of weight). After deducting the one-third sold in the province, the rest will be dumped in Shanghai. Compared to the current sales capacity of the fish market, it is impossible to handle such a large amount of fish, which will inevitably lead to a drastic drop in prices. Next year, the fishermen will be exhausted and unable to go to sea, which may lead to the collapse of the entire fishing industry. This is a crucial matter for the future of the nation. We were sent by the association as representatives to Shanghai to present the advantages and disadvantages to leaders from all walks of life. We also hope that your association will provide assistance to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of fishermen and benefit both the nation and the people.' Based on this, we hereby request that you investigate and respond promptly."</p>
<h3>Chinese Buddhist Association Amends Constitution to Resolve Issues</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains Guild Notice Refusing Adulterated Grains</h3>
<p>In Response to the Request of the Oil Pressing Industry Guild</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Trade Guild has issued a notice to its members, urging them to carefully receive and unload shipments due to the recent adulteration of soybeans with heavy mud and sand from various regions: "According to a letter from the Water City Oil Pressing Factory Trade Guild, 'The practice of adulterating soybeans with mud has been addressed to your guild before. If it is not rectified, it will severely affect the operations of our industry. Therefore, we are writing to you again to promptly develop effective methods to eliminate this malpractice.' We agree that as the market price of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains rises, vendors are trying to maximize profits through fraudulent means, such as adulterating with sand and soil. This practice is rampant, and our members are suffering losses. It has been resolved in our meeting that henceforth, the purchase and sale of soybeans and other miscellaneous grains must be handled with care, and vendors who excessively adulterate them with mud and sand should be refused. We will also send a letter to relevant organizations in the production areas, urging them to supervise farmers to rectify this practice locally. This is hereby notified for your information."</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Electrical Appliances Expected to Increase Prices</h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan Discusses the Current Situation of the Industry</p>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, of the Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Trade Guild, told reporters yesterday that the guild is composed of domestically owned electrical appliance manufacturing factories. It is one of the industry guilds recently established by the Ministry of Industry. The addition of the word "manufacturing" is to distinguish it from commercial trade guilds. The guild is divided into ten groups, including motors, flashlights, light bulbs, and electric fans. Since the beginning of the year, members of each group have been very active, and new members are constantly joining, which is a positive sign for China's industrial sector. However, the prices of raw materials such as copper, iron, lead, and tin have been rising continuously, leading to increased production costs. Therefore, domestically produced electrical appliances are expected to increase prices in the near future.</p>

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (16)</h3>
<p>Q: Mr. Liang Yanping from Guangzhou asks: Can a letter sent to a foreign country be re-sent back to the original sending location after arriving in that country (i.e., if a letter from Guangzhou to England is sent back to Guangzhou after arriving in England)? If it can be sent back, should the sender indicate this on the envelope, should additional postage be paid, and if so, how much? Also, after it is sent back, will it be delivered to the sender's address by the post office, or must the sender go to the post office to pick it up? If the latter, will the post office provide notification?</p>
<p>A: The question of whether a letter arriving in a foreign country can be re-sent back to the original sending location depends on whether the letter could not be delivered in the first place, or whether it was delivered as addressed and is being returned. The question is somewhat unclear. If it refers to a letter that could not be delivered (e.g., the recipient refuses to accept it, the recipient's address cannot be found, the recipient has left the country, or moved elsewhere, etc.), then any letter sent to any country can be returned by the destination country to the originating country. When the originating country's post office receives it, if the sender's name and detailed address are on the envelope, it will be delivered accordingly without additional charges. If there is no sender's name and address, the post office will post a notice for one month. If no one claims it within one month, it will be sent to the designated undeliverable mail office for processing. As for letters that have already been delivered as addressed or show signs of having been opened after delivery, if they are to be returned to the original sending location, the recipient must affix stamps according to the local international postage rates and treat it as a newly posted item. For example, a letter from England to Guangzhou weighing no more than twenty grams requires an additional stamp of one and a half pence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for letters sent to various countries, before they have been delivered to the recipient, the sender may apply to the original post office to withdraw the letter according to the prescribed procedures. For details, inquire at the local post office. However, letters sent to the United Kingdom and its territories cannot be withdrawn once they have left the jurisdiction of the Chinese postal service.</p>
<p>Q: Mr. Jian from Shanghai asks: ❶ The domestic postage for ordinary letters is five cents for every twenty grams. If the letter weighs less than twenty grams, is it still five cents? If it weighs twenty-one grams, should one dime be paid? Is the difference of nineteen grams considered a voluntary waiver by the sender? ❷ For third-class bulk newspapers, each bundle must contain at least fifty copies. According to the postage rates, if each copy weighs ninety-eight grams, the entire bundle only needs to be stamped with five cents. If each bundle only contains twenty-five copies, and the sender is willing to pay five cents, can it be accepted according to the example above of a letter weighing less than twenty grams but being charged as twenty grams?</p>
<p>A: ❶ The standard for calculating letter postage is based on units of twenty grams. Any fraction less than twenty grams is calculated as twenty grams. Therefore, letters exchanged between post offices, not exceeding twenty grams or forty grams, require stamps of one dime. The rest can be deduced by analogy. ❷ The conditions for constituting third-class bulk newspapers are detailed in Question and Answer No. 8. Having at least fifty copies per bundle is one of the conditions. Newspapers with fewer than fifty copies do not meet the specified conditions and cannot be posted as third-class newspapers.</p>

<h3>Robbery on Damuqiao Road Leads to Victim's Death</h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, Huang Runzhou (24 years old), a native of Pudong who worked at Huie Bank in Shanghai, was robbed at his home at No. 458 Damuqiao Road, in the new southern district of Shanghai. Six robbers speaking the Anhui dialect broke into his house by digging a hole in the wall from a vacant house next door and sneaking in. When Huang Runzhou shouted for help, he was shot once in the lower left abdomen, and the bullet pierced his intestines and stomach. The robbers stole valuables and fled. Afterwards, Huang's family took the injured man to the Guangci Hospital on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession for treatment. However, his injuries were fatal, and he died yesterday morning due to excessive blood loss. The police station in charge received a report and immediately ordered the local bailiff to report it to the court for an autopsy. It was determined that he had died from a gunshot wound sustained during the robbery. The police will rigorously investigate and arrest the robbers and bring them to justice. The family has been instructed to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Jixi Fellow Villagers Association Held Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jixi Native Place Association held its 25th Joint Executive and Supervisory Committee meeting at 3 PM on March 20th. Chairman Cheng Kefan presided over the meeting with due ceremony.

It was resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Anhui Higher Court, urging them to promptly remove and punish the Jixi prison warden as a means of relief. In addition, a telegram was sent to the Jixi County government, urging them to issue a public notice prohibiting the private felling of ancient trees and forests, and stipulating that no felling should be allowed without the unanimous consent of the owners. ㊁ A letter from the Anhui Native Place Association, announcing that Ambassador Xu would return to China and a public banquet would be held at the Atlantic Hotel on the 22nd of this month, inviting participation. It was resolved to comply. ㊂ Regarding the association's financial difficulties, it was resolved to promptly collect outstanding dues and to print and distribute the report for the 25th year. The meeting adjourned with other minor matters briefly discussed.</p>
<h3>Person Killed by Train on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>Circumstances Very Tragic</p>
<p>At approximately 7 AM yesterday, at the 102-kilometer mark between Wangdian and Jiaxing stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the body of a rural man, approximately three years old, was discovered on the tracks. He had apparently been run over by a train the previous night, with his head and feet separated in a gruesome sight. The Jiaxing station master immediately dispatched railway police to guard the scene and instructed the local bailiff to report the incident and seek out relatives of the deceased to come to the station to identify the body and coffin. If the deceased is found to be impoverished, the railway will provide 20 yuan as a gesture of compassion.</p>

Ms. Jizhen's Western paintings are fresh and lively, full of natural charm. Ma Gongyu inscribed on Xuejiu's painting, "Good water, good mountains, with ink and brush. Her spirit overwhelms the male eyebrow, and light shines from the female headscarf." He inscribed on Jizhen's painting, "Captures the spirit vividly, skillful in depicting objects, masters Western methods, and possesses Eastern style." Wang Yachen, Wang Yiting, Yankechang, Liu Linsheng, and others also wrote inscriptions, expressing their admiration.</p>
<h3>Penguin Society and Qingying Society Jointly Hold Photo Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Reasons for the Evolution of Modern Politics.</p>
<p>There are three main reasons for the evolution of modern politics:</p>
<p>㊀ Emergency Measures for Special Changes - Internal Troubles - Class Struggle; Foreign Threats! - National Struggle.</p>
<p>㊁ Improving Work Efficiency - (1) Increased Specialization of Responsibility, (2) More Detailed Planning, (3) More Experience, (4) More Refined Technology, (5) Faster Time.</p>
<p>㊂ Eliminating the Harms of Checks and Balances - Dispersed Power - Counteracted Power - Prevented Power.</p>
<p>These three are the main reasons. There are many other reasons, and now I will explain these three main reasons separately:</p>
<p>The circumstances faced by various countries in recent times are very different from before. Any country has internal and external troubles from time to time, because the so-called class struggle now is internal trouble, and the so-called national struggle is external threat. These two forms constitute the emergency events of various countries today, so emergency measures are necessary. In the past, the regulations of democratic countries were: when an urgent special change occurred, the head of state was authorized by the group; but this is impossible today, because today's aspects, such as diplomacy, military affairs, culture, and economy, are constantly in struggle, not to mention politics. How can we authorize processing anytime, anywhere in this state of struggle anytime, anywhere? Therefore, countries understand this point and should prepare for struggle anytime, anywhere. What is the way? It is to get rid of the old problem of much discussion and little success, that is, to authorize one party, to authorize a leader of one party. This reason is the most important of the three reasons, because if the urgent requirements cannot be met, the country is in danger, society is chaotic, and there is no talk of anything else.

<h3>Tragic Incident of Cutting Off a Sick Child's Finger Due to Superstition</h3>
<p>Police File Charges of Abandoning a Corpse; Jiang Erqun and His Wife Still Trying to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Jiang Zhang, the wife of Jiang Erqun, a rickshaw puller from Tongzhou, resides at No. 9, Lane 29, No. 1029, East Xihua Road. Recently, their newborn eight-month-old child, named Xiaogou, became critically ill. Prayers to the gods and medical treatment proved ineffective. There is a superstition among the people of Tongzhou that Jiang Zhang had previously given birth to two children who died one after another. She believed that this child was the reincarnation of a debtor and that the debt had to be broken with a ritual. At 7 PM on the 10th of this month, while Xiaogou was still alive, she agreed with her husband. She took a pair of scissors and cut off one of the child's right thumbs, causing a lot of bleeding, soaking his body. She wrapped it in straw paper with four dimes, summoned a beggar named Jia, and instructed him to take the child to the barren land of Gaolang Bridge and abandon him. However, after obtaining the money, the beggar actually abandoned the child next to a trash can in a nearby alley and fled. At 8:30 AM the next morning, Jiang Zhang passed by Kunming Road and suddenly saw that the child was not dead. Saddened by the sight, she picked him up and placed him in a sleeping bamboo basket to observe his condition. The incident was reported to the Huishan Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Li Zhaogeng to investigate and confirm the facts. The police took Jiang Zhang and her husband, along with the child, to the police station. The child was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital, where he soon died. The body was then taken to the corpse examination site on Feilun Road, where the prosecutor of the Special First Court confirmed that the cause of death of the child Xiaogou was illness and blood loss. Jiang Zhang and her husband were sent to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation and detained. Yesterday, Judge Jing Bianfen presided over the continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that in recent years, in the desolate and remote areas around Yangshupu Huishan, numerous abandoned infant corpses have been discovered, too many to count and impossible to investigate. They may be similar to the cruel and superstitious people like the two defendants. He filed a public prosecution based on Article 295 of the Criminal Law for abandoning a corpse, seeking severe punishment. When questioned, the defendants claimed that the child's right thumb was cut off by the beggar and pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao ordered that they be remanded in custody separately, awaiting sentencing.</p>

<h3>Bank Rural Investment Inspired by the New Monetary System</h3>
<p>— Mu Jie</p>
<p>——Total Liquidation of the 25th Year——</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>(2) An Overview of Investment</p>
<p>(3) Investment Statistics</p>
<p>(4) Reasons for Activity</p>
<p>(5) Review of Investment</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Since the formation of capital in the banking industry has led to urban expansion and rural decline, there has been a stream of bank funds irrigating the countryside. Of course, the unbalanced distribution of funds between urban and rural areas has resulted in an overabundance of cash in cities, with falling interbank lending rates and rampant speculation, while rural areas sometimes lack even a single yuan. Therefore, the ability of banks to return funds to rural areas is a wonderful way to diagnose the most serious pathology of rural decline - the depletion of funds.</p>
<p>But when did the banking industry's rural investment begin to show significant signs? Looking at the Bank of China and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, which were the earliest to invest in rural areas, the Bank of China's large-scale rural lending began in the 21st year (Note 1), and the Agricultural Cooperative Lending Department of the Shanghai Bank was established in the 22nd year (Note 2). Looking at the government's measures, after the Rural Reconstruction Committee, established in April of the 22nd year, sent a letter to the Shanghai financial community to provide relief to the countryside, the call for investing in rural areas swept the country for a time. Therefore, we can say that the 22nd year was the year when the banking industry officially established contact with rural areas, that is, the year when it openly invested in rural areas.</p>
<p>From the 22nd year to the 25th year, the history of the banking industry's investment in rural areas has been four years. Without asking what responsibilities it has fulfilled in terms of relieving the countryside, its position in rural finance is still very low. According to the Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry (November of the 23rd year), bank loans account for an average of 2.4% of rural borrowing sources. Of course, this is not enough to explain the current status of the banking industry's rural investment in rural finance, but it can be asserted that it still does not have an important position.</p>
<p>However, since the implementation of the new monetary policy on November 3 of the 24th year, we can clearly see that the government intends to use it as the driving force for rural revitalization. The government not only gave the Farmers Bank of China the right to issue 100 million yuan of banknotes and the obligation to handle 50 million yuan of agricultural loans, but also vigorously encouraged commercial banks to invest in rural areas, and the joint lending funds of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank were also subscribed by various banks. Therefore, it can be predicted without any doubt that since the 25th year, the banking industry's rural investment will occupy an important position in rural finance due to the stimulation of the legal tender policy.</p>
<p>Because of the promotion of the government's legal tender policy mentioned above, the banking industry's rural investment in the 25th year was quite active. The 25th year was also a year of bumper harvests, and rural warehouses were built in various provinces, which required even more investment from the banking industry. Compared with the situation in previous years, there must be a leap forward. We will know by investigating the situation of the banking industry's rural investment in the first year after the legal tender travel - the 25th year.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Regarding the actual situation of investment, anyone who pays a little attention to newspapers and magazines knows that it is countless. In terms of region, which province, except for the too remote border provinces, does not have the irrigation of bank funds! In terms of the banks engaged in, which commercial, industrial, professional, or savings bank, apart from those specializing in agriculture, does not have at least some!</p>
<p>First, let's look at the Farmers Bank of China. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, the bank has been specially approved by the Ministry of Finance to issue 100 million yuan of circulating notes, with half of them used for agricultural loans. The content of agricultural loans: First, the types of loans are divided into land mortgage loans and rural loans; the former should be based on rural land as a principle, and loans for improving soil and consolidating farmland are also included; the latter should pay special attention to the relief of owner-farmers and organized and sound cooperatives to invest funds. Second, agricultural loans should be handled in places with convenient transportation to establish agricultural warehouses to facilitate the transportation and sale of agricultural products. Third, promote agricultural bills to circulate farmers' funds. According to the loan amount published by the bank in late August of the 25th year, the total loan amount was 11,680,000 yuan, including 7,282,000 yuan for cooperative loans, 1,728,000 yuan for movable property mortgage loans, 2,293,000 yuan for agricultural warehouse loans, and 377,000 yuan for special loans. In the news in mid-December, the bank's rural cooperative loans were nearly 80 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Bank of China's rural investment has a history of five years, and the amount of rural loans in the 24th year accounted for about 6% of the various loans. The situation in the 25th year can be simply said to be an investment of 500,000 yuan in Henan Province to promote American cotton seeds, production loans in Jiangxi Province, production and marketing loans for tea, cotton, rice, wheat and other agricultural products in Anhui Province, 500,000 yuan of rural loans in Hunan Province, and 100,000 yuan of spring plowing and silkworm cocoon drying loans in Zhejiang Province, and a plan for agricultural warehouse investment of 10 million yuan. Although the Bank of China is a national chartered international exchange bank, it has a very strong commercial nature, so it is regarded as the representative of commercial banks.</p>
<p>From the above description, we can get a glimpse of the investment status in the 25th year, and other situations are also comprehensively introduced in the next chapter, which is omitted here. Now, let's describe two more organized and planned investment situations.</p>
<p>Because rural funding is declining day by day, the rural investment of various banks is not only a drop in the bucket, but also does not help, and each bank mostly operates independently, without an organization with a whole organization to engage in under a comprehensive plan, as a result, it still does not have much benefit for the countryside. Therefore, in order to achieve one of the goals of the new monetary system (relieving the countryside), the government specially established the Agricultural and Commercial Bank jointly with various banks to rescue the circulation of agricultural funds, adjust agricultural products, and develop the countryside. The funds of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank are divided into fixed, joint lending, and circulating funds. In addition to the fixed funds of 30 million yuan borne by the government, the joint lending funds of 30 million yuan and the indefinite amount of circulating funds are all subscribed by the banks. The joint lending funds are paid up in five years, and the 6 million yuan payable in the 25th year is borne by 30 banks, savings societies, and trust companies. The distribution is as follows: 12 with less than 50,000, 4 with 50,000 to 100,000, 9 with 100,000 to 500,000, and 5 with more than 500,000. The detailed numbers are as follows (unit: 10,000 yuan):</p>
<p>The loans of the Jiangzhe spring cocoon collection failure silver group, although it is said that the borrowers are manufacturers, directly benefit the cocoon farmers, and have a regulatory function for rural finance, and of course, it is also one of the rural investments. In the past, each bank carried out the loans for spring cocoon collection independently. In the 25th year, an organized and planned silver group was established to handle this matter. The participating banks include 19 major Shanghai banks such as China Communications Bank and Fuyuan Qianzhuang. The amount of loans was originally set at 30 million yuan, and the result was about 13 million yuan. Jiangsu Province accounted for 80% and Zhejiang Province accounted for 20%. In Zhejiang, because the Provincial Silkworm Silk Control Association borrowed another 5 million yuan from China Communications Bank to purchase the remaining cocoons, the amount was very small.</p>
<p>In short, there is no doubt that the banking industry's rural investment at the end of the 25th year was active, and the word active in front has this very good fact as its report. Now, in order to make the above more based, we will further sort out the investment situation statistically to the extent possible.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>It is really difficult to sort out the banking industry's investment in rural areas in a statistical way and make it a systematic posture. First, most of the information on which this article is based is recorded in daily newspapers, but the same matter has great discrepancies before and after, and the reports of various newspapers are sometimes different, and it is difficult to judge the actual situation of some news. Second, the newspapers on which this article is based are only in Shanghai, and the information is not very rich, and those that cannot be used are also rejected. Therefore, only a simple sorting and analysis can be done as follows:</p>
<p>First of all, regarding the analysis of investment types and regions, this "type" is worth studying. First, if we talk about the process from farmers' cultivation, harvesting to sales, there are green seedlings, storage mortgage, and marketing loans; if we talk about the object of investment, there are loans for major agricultural products and sideline products; if we talk about the lending agencies, there are various cooperatives, agricultural loan offices, agricultural warehouses, and rural committee loans; if we talk about the realizability of the investment target; there are loans for movable property and immovable property; if we talk about the existence or absence of collateral, there are mortgage loans and credit loans. However, this is not an absolute classification. A certain type of loan can have two or more classifications. For example, agricultural product storage mortgage loans in agricultural warehouses can be regarded as mortgage loans, agricultural product loans, movable property loans, or storage mortgage loans. Second, if we say that rural investment is divided into land mortgage loans and rural loans (Note 3), then there are very few banks operating land mortgage loans now, and all loans can be classified into rural loans, which is too complicated. The investment types in the table below are filled in according to what is recorded in the newspaper, and are not completely classified according to the first method.</p>
<p>Secondly, the statistics on investment amount, period, and interest rate can be divided into two forms, one with complete period and interest rate, and one with only the name of the loan and the bank. In the table below, ‰o represents the monthly interest rate, and % represents the annual interest rate.</p>
<p>From the above two totals added together, the rural investment in the 25th year has been 57 million yuan, but this is not enough to see the amount of rural investment in the 25th year. Now I will try to estimate it.</p>
<p>According to the agricultural bank loans recorded in the Bank Yearbook (25th year), the most should be the Farmers Bank of China, followed by the Soviet Farmers Bank, and other agricultural banks account for a very small amount, which will be omitted here. The various loans of China Farmers in the 24th year were 25,780,000 yuan, about twice as much as in the 23rd year, so the increase in the 25th year is also considered to be within two times, which should be 50 million yuan, but the Ministry of Finance stipulates that 50 million yuan of circulating notes should be used for agricultural loans, so it should be a number of 100 million yuan (the above statement has nearly 80 million yuan of loans). The loans of Su Farmers in the 24th year were 10,350,000 yuan, an increase of 30% compared with the 23rd year. The increase in the 25th year is also considered to be 30%, which should be 13.5 million yuan. The investment of various commercial banks is estimated based on the reports of various banks. It was 50 million yuan in the 23rd year and 65 million yuan in the 24th year. The increase in the 24th year was 30% higher than that in the 23rd year, so it should be 84.5 million yuan in the 25th year. Estimated in this way, the banking industry's rural investment in the 25th year should be 198 million yuan. Try to list it again as follows: (unit: 1,000 yuan)</p>
<p>The authenticity of this number will be left to the proof of the facts.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Whether from the overview of investment or the statistics of investment, it is enough to prove the activity of rural investment in the 25th year. Now analyze the reasons for its activity.</p>
<p>(1) For the banking industry's investment in rural areas, the previous few years were just a plan to expand business and solve the way out for funds, which was completely a risky trial business. But unexpectedly, almost all of the loaned funds can be recovered, with only a small part extended, and the stipulated monthly interest rate for loans is 1%, which can also be determined according to local conditions (see the Shanghai Bank Agricultural Loan Regulations). The profit is certainly not as rich and easy to obtain as speculation, but it is quite superior to general investment, and the degree of safety is very high. Therefore, in the past, only one or two banks operated, and now other banks have also invested in rural areas one after another as a way to expand business, solve the way out for funds, and obtain profits. What's more, it can win the good reputation of following government laws and regulations and sponsoring government relief in rural areas!</p>
<p>(2) Articles 7 and 8 of the Savings Bank Law promulgated by the government in the 23rd year stipulate that the pledge loans of savings banks to rural cooperatives and the loans with agricultural products as collateral shall not be less than one-fifth of the total amount of deposits. There are very few banks specializing in savings business now, but all major commercial banks have savings departments, which are also regarded as savings banks according to the interpretation of the law. Therefore, even though the original intention of each bank to establish a savings department is not because the nature of savings banks is suitable for investing in rural areas, each bank has to operate it because of the constraints of laws and regulations. The banking industry invests in rural areas for its own interests and seeks to comply with laws and regulations, which is not without the enlightenment of laws and regulations; and the activity of investment in the 25th year is not without the effect of laws and regulations in addition to other reasons.</p>
<p>(3) In recent years, the construction of agricultural warehouses in various places has also been an end of the government's relief in rural areas. In the 25th year, the trend of establishing agricultural warehouses was really surging. On the one hand, it is one of the key points to relieve the countryside, and on the other hand, because the agricultural investment of banks in rural areas has been handled with excellent results and they are happy to invest, the source of construction funds is not very difficult. Therefore, they were established one after another. In addition, the 25th year was also a year of bumper harvests. Under the slogan of preventing low grain prices from hurting farmers, the construction of agricultural warehouses was particularly necessary, and therefore the demand for funds was even more urgent. - The establishment of agricultural warehouses has its own reasons, but the promotion of construction by banks' willingness to invest, and the promotion of banks' investment by the establishment of agricultural warehouses, are at least somewhat related. - Therefore, it is also an element of the active rural investment of the banking industry in the 25th year.</p>
<p>This is in terms of the achievements of bank investment, the regulations of laws and regulations, and the construction of agricultural warehouses. If we talk about the impact of the implementation of the new monetary policy and other reasons, then:</p>
<p>Obviously, the government's new monetary policy has had a considerable impact. Because since the new monetary system implemented by the government on November 3 of the 24th year stipulated that the exchange notes of the three national chartered banks, Central, China, and Communications, were issued centrally as legal tender, the profits of issuing exchange notes of the banks that had the right to issue exchange notes before were deprived. This is one of them.</p>
<p>The new monetary policy not only deprived commercial banks of the profits of issuing exchange notes, but also gave the three banks of Central, China, and Communications the unlimited right to buy and sell foreign exchange. Therefore, the foreign exchange business of various commercial banks was of course greatly affected. Moreover, due to the reason that the three banks have unlimited buying and selling of foreign exchange, the speculation of foreign exchange has been banned invisibly. This is the second.</p>
<p>Following this major reform, in February of the 25th year, the government used unified government bonds to exchange old bonds and used a part of the reconstruction government bonds as a fund to balance the bond market. Therefore, the speculative activities that could make a lot of profit in an instant, which used to be the main business of various banks, became difficult to speculate due to the stable market price after the exchange. Therefore, whether from the perspective of capital operation or profit acquisition, it always suffered the greatest loss. This is the third.</p>
<p>Speaking only of speculation, not only government bonds and foreign exchange cannot be speculated, but also the Shanghai standard gold, which has the title of the world's largest speculation, is also banned invisibly because the new currency value is separated from the silver price and there is no connection. In addition, although there is a policy of preparing for the establishment of real estate banks in the new monetary policy, the real estate industry, which was attacked by the economic panic, is still sluggish, and this way of speculation is also impossible. This is the fourth.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say that a few percent or a few dozen percent of these four reasons promoted the banking industry's advancement of rural investment, but speaking from the fact that the scope of business (referring to improper business) is gradually narrowed, the operation of funds is difficult, and the source of profit is cut off, the above four reasons are undoubtedly the factors that the banking industry's rural investment was active in the 25th year in order to expand the business scope, solve the way out for funds, and seek the source of profit.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The banking industry's rural investment in the 25th year was not only active, but also had very strict regulations on the method of lending in order to ensure the safety of funds. Let's review the situation in this year:</p>
<p>There are precise restrictions on the use of funds. For example, in the loan method signed by the Bank of China and the Hunan Provincial Construction Department. The use of credit loans is limited to the purchase of seeds, fertilizers, livestock, other necessities for operating agriculture, and equipment for transportation, sales or refining, and other things needed for agricultural production.</p>
<p>There is an appropriate allocation for the use of funds. For example, the Fujian Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Loan Method of the Farmers Bank of China stipulates that the construction or repair of warehouse buildings shall not exceed 60% of the total cost of labor and materials; the purchase of processing equipment shall not exceed 70% of the total cost. For example, the Qicha production loan of China Communications Bank is particularly detailed; it stipulates that each box of refined tea shall not exceed 25 yuan, the first phase shall prepay 5 yuan per box as a prepaid tea worker, and purchase firewood, charcoal and box materials, the second phase shall be 8 yuan to 12 yuan for the purpose of purchasing tea making tools, etc., and the third phase shall be 9 yuan to 11 yuan for the purpose of paying wages.</p>
<p>Looking at the lending method, it can be divided into: 1. Cooperate with the Rural Cooperative Committee or the Construction Department, invest in cooperatives, 2. Cooperate with local governments or local banks, invest in agricultural warehouses or agricultural products, etc., 3. Directly run it yourself or lend to local governments to run it. However, in order to ensure the safety of loans, there is a trend of increasing the responsibility of cooperative agencies in the 25th year. For example, the main points of the 16 articles of the adjustment of cooperative loan methods negotiated by Su Nong and the Construction Department are: When a cooperative borrows from the bank, it should be introduced by the cooperative instructor in charge, and the bank directly lends to the cooperative, it should notify the cooperative instructor afterwards; however, the cooperative instructor should review the agricultural loan in advance and sign the opinion, and be responsible for the use and safety of the loan.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of loans from various banks in the same province, there is a trend of district activities. For example, the principles of the agricultural warehouse loan specially agreed by various banks in Anhui Province stipulate that the China Banking Group is responsible for 24 counties such as Qimen Fengyang, the Bank of China is responsible for 12 counties such as Xuancheng Dangtu, and the Farmers Bank of China is responsible for 12 counties such as Wuhu Hefei. The same is true in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>However, this state is the progress of the banking industry's own investment methods. It is difficult to say how much actual benefit it has for farmers. The bank authorities may think that it is perfect, while the farmers may think that this restriction is difficult. And aren't the bank's regulations still set up for the safety of their own funds! There is nothing wrong with the bank having various restrictions for the safety of investing funds, but it is not difficult to imagine the feelings of the farmers. Let's talk about the district investment again. Isn't it just to avoid investment competition between each other (in prosperous areas)! Where is the benefit for the farmers? Let's look at the interest rate of the loan:</p>
<p>According to the previous statistics, the highest monthly interest rate is 1%, the lowest is 8%, the highest annual interest rate is 1%, and the lowest is 9%. On the banking side, it can be said that it is already very low. However, in reality, the lowest interest rate that farmers can enjoy is 1.2% per month, the highest is 1.8%, and 1.5% is even more common. For example, the provisional measures for Qicha loans of China Communications Bank stipulate that the monthly interest rate is 8%, and the interest rate for cooperatives to transfer goods to their members shall not exceed 4% of the original loan interest rate to the cooperative (that is, it shall not exceed 1.2% per month). The monthly interest rate for miscellaneous movable property mortgage loans of Zhejiang Local Bank is 1.5% (according to the bank's report, including custody fees, etc.). The monthly interest rate in the agricultural cooperative grain mortgage method set by the Fujian Rural Cooperative Committee is 1.7%. The interest rate of the farmer mortgage loan office established by China Farmers Bank in Wuhu, Anhui Province is 1.5%, plus 3% for custody, totaling 1.8%. We can only say that this monthly interest rate of 1.5% to 1.7% is lower than that of high-interest loans, but if compared with the highest monthly interest rate of 1% and the lowest annual interest rate of 9% in the above statistics, wouldn't this be regarded as a high-interest loan?</p>
<p>The benefits that farmers can receive from bank fund irrigation are as mentioned above. Now, in terms of the investment area, there is still a concentrated situation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, followed by Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi, and then Jiangxi, Hubei and Hunan provinces. Although the three southeastern provinces are the most declining in rural areas, they are rich areas. Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi have greatly increased cotton production in recent years. No wonder bank funds are attacking!</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>In short, the banking industry's rural investment after the implementation of the new monetary policy is of course an epoch-making year in the 25th year compared with the past situation. For commercial banks, due to the improvement of the monetary and banking system, improper business is gradually being banned or voluntarily abandoned, making a normal expansion in order to stabilize their foundation. There is no doubt that investing in rural areas is the current normal expansion. For farmers banks, the government's monetary policy promotes land mortgage and agricultural loans with 50 million yuan of circulating notes. Speaking from the investment process of farmers banks, it is a leap forward. - For example, in terms of the allocation of investment amount, commercial banks accounted for about 28% in the 23rd year and about 36% in the 24th year, accounting for the largest part, while in the 25th year, it has accounted for 57% (according to the aforementioned estimate).</p>
<p>The situation in the 25th year is like this. If we make a prediction for the 26th year, there will be at least a normal development. For example, it is reported that China Communications Bank will double the number of loans that were loaned last year - 8 million yuan for the Bank of China and 3 million yuan for the China Communications Bank. However, for the interest rate of the loan and the investment area, the former hopes to be reduced again, and there should be a maximum restriction on the interest rate of the transfer agency; the latter hopes to develop evenly in all provinces and regions.</p>
<p>The information on which this article is based is not rich, and the author is ignorant. The statistics in the third section may be too simple, the estimation may be inaccurate, the analysis of the reasons in the fourth section may be inappropriate, and the review of the investment in the fifth section is only based on the investment itself. I hope the readers will understand.</p>

<p>The Bond Market Fluctuated Sharply Last Week</p>
<p>A Sudden Prosperity on the Silent Trading Floor</p>
<p>A Vigorous Market Situation is Quite Rare</p>
<p>The government bond market last week, after a long period of hovering, suddenly fluctuated sharply, and the market situation suddenly soared. At the beginning of the week, because the bulls and bears held each other, the market price still rose and fell by only a few cents in the dullness. By Thursday, there were suddenly favorable rumors, and the market atmosphere suddenly became excited. The financial community absorbed it like bees, and then the gold industry and yarn cloth gangs also raised it fiercely. The silent trading floor changed into a vigorous market situation, and the market price stepped up sharply, and each bond repeatedly created new highs and exceeded the 70 yuan mark. The prosperous state is quite rare. Although the trend has reached its peak, there is no sign of fatigue due to the strong support of the people and the stability of the situation. There are only two days of trading left in this month's futures. Under the consolidated strength of the bulls in the boom market, there is a great risk of squeezing the short position in the future. The whole week's experience is as follows. The trading floor was extremely silent on Monday, and large investors were nowhere to be seen. The market price hovered by only a few cents. The trend to Guangdong became more and more sluggish on Monday. There was a lot of absorption on the 4th, but the market situation still did not rise or fall. The confrontation between the bulls and bears was even stronger on Wednesday, and the dullness had not yet been lifted. In the early morning of Thursday, the market situation was still chaotic and inconsistent. Until the after-market, due to favorable rumors, the 10.77.34 and other generations of the financial community rose to buy, and the market price suddenly soared by more than one yuan. On Friday, there was a decline in the early market due to the emergence of retail investors. However, due to the strong popularity, the 4.11.5 and other generations of the gold and yarn gangs absorbed vigorously. The unified bonds all soared again by one yuan to one yuan and a half. The upward trend did not diminish on Saturday. The 4.43 and other retail investors emerged to sell, but the 11.50 and others still had a large number of purchases. The market price still rose by half a yuan, the E species rebounded by one yuan, and the gold leader rose by two yuan. The 96 broke through the 10 yuan mark due to the purchase of 14.50 and 5. The result of the whole week was that all soared by 3 yuan, 5 cents to 3 yuan, 6 cents and a half, and the A species and the gold leader rose by 2 yuan and 2 yuan, 4 cents and a half. The total number of transactions was 53,660,000 yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall is listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Indian and British Cotton Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with mixed market conditions. Prices for various months fell by six points or rose by one point. Soon after, trading firms bought near-month contracts, and market prices recovered. Opinions on government actions were highly divided. Later, much had to be settled. The market encountered buying from Wall Street, and the closing was strong. Spot prices rose by five points, and futures prices rose by one to eight points. British cotton spot prices fell by nine points, and futures prices fell by nine to ten points. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying from trading firms and bullish positions, but later fell due to profit-taking by long positions and a weak stock market. Bengal fell by 3.5 to 3.75 rupees, Oomra fell by 3.5 to 4.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 3.75 to 4.25 rupees. (Recorded by telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 22nd: Broach at 244 rupees, Oomra at 233 rupees, both up 3.5 rupees; Bengal at 195.25 rupees, up 3.25 rupees.</p>

<p>Owners of Inferior Rice Lower Prices to Unload</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various regions surged in, totaling over sixty firms, with a total of 12,120 piculs of goods arriving. Among them, inferior rice accounted for nearly fifty firms. As a result, those with inferior rice felt disheartened, and merchants were wary in the early market. Sellers had no choice but to lower prices to unload. Initially, merchants from Xi'an made moves, followed by those from Qingdao. Consequently, a total of over 4,000 bags of inferior rice were sold, and prices fell by half a dime. Although the arrival of thick japonica rice was limited, stores in rural towns initially did not take it in, and prices still fell by one dime. Only Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan Lai rice, due to their scarcity, could still maintain their prices, but the situation already showed signs of weakening.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty ships arrived from various regions downstream. The market for various goods was slow, with prices for white japonica rice falling by a small fraction of a dime to one dime. Inferior rice also softened by five to six cents. The price of Yang Du Bu Xian rice also weakened. Ke Jian and Heping rice sold well in small quantities, and prices remained firm. All other goods showed signs of weakening.</p>

<h3>Spring on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— (Yan Chonglou)</p>
<p>Spring has come to the world, but the battlefield sees no spring. The battlefield's dark sky does not shine with warm sunlight; the battlefield's dense clouds do not reveal clear skies; the battlefield's howling winds do not bring a hint of gentle intoxication; the battlefield's miles of flat sand do not sprout tender green shoots, let alone red peach blossoms or swaying green willows. On the battlefield, only the sound of bugles is heard, not the songs of orioles or the chirping of swallows. The soldiers on the battlefield spend their days lying in muddy trenches, firing guns and using bullets, working hard with their hands and feet, not thinking about spring outings or picnics. Spring does not come to this border battlefield, but they must go to that border battlefield where there is no spring. Do they not love this beautiful spring? Do they want to abandon this bright spring?</p>
<p>No, they also know how lovely spring is, but they feel that now is not the time to enjoy it. This spring still contains many painful histories! Look, those compatriots cannot return home! Those lands have been seized by others to cultivate! And if our compatriots do not know how to invigorate themselves, and instead indulge in the embrace of spring, this great land will be completely lost to the enemy! Therefore, the soldiers on the battlefield do not hesitate to sacrifice their flesh and blood bodies and fight desperately with the enemy, sacrificing for the freedom of the entire nation. They want to wrest our own spring from the enemy's hands.</p>
<p>The battlefield sees no spring; spring is only deeply hidden in the hearts of the soldiers.</p>
<h3>Wax Tigers by the Mekong River</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>In the eyes of local hunters in Southeast Asia, wax tigers are simply regarded as treasures among beasts. Often, obtaining a wax tiger can provide a comfortable life for several months without having to hunt in the mountains. These wax tigers mostly appear in the area of ​​Arra Sueed on the northern bank of the Mekong River. Due to over-hunting in recent years, they have gradually become scarce.</p>
<p>The shape of the wax tiger is similar to that of a regular tiger, but its body is slightly smaller. There is a type of wax tree here, and their only food is the raw wax on the trees. Because these trees are thirty to forty feet tall, when wax tigers climb to the top of the tree to forage, they occasionally fall straight down from the tall tree if they are not careful. Strangely, they never faint or get injured as a result. Once they fall to the ground, they lose consciousness and fall into a deep sleep. Even if there are loud noises nearby, they will not wake up. They gradually wake up after about an hour. Hunters often take advantage of their sleeping opportunity to capture them effortlessly, but some spend many days guarding under the wax trees and get nothing. Naturally, it depends on the hunter's luck.</p>
<p>The most valuable things on a wax tiger are its gall bladder and skin. The gall bladder, after being soaked in medicinal water, can cure all kinds of bruises and injuries. In the past, doctors in Southeast Asia often traveled to the homes of hunters to buy them, and each gall bladder was worth as much as three to four hundred gold coins. Even local hunters, if they accidentally fought with wild animals and were injured, could apply this gall bladder water and recover quickly. Unfortunately, in recent years, hunters have been blinded by greed and sell fake goods, so sales have gradually decreased. As for tiger skins, they are used to make vests, which are worn close to the body and can resist bullets. Therefore, a tiger skin can also be bought for about a hundred gold coins!</p>

<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>"Pink envelope," was a female colleague of mine. Although she was not a graduate of a famous school that specializes in cultivating social butterflies, and she did not possess the beauty worthy of wearing a queen's crown, she was still a high school graduate, and she still possessed the lines and contours that a young woman should have. Therefore, when she first arrived, many colleagues were quite enamored with her. However, because of her lack of smiles and icy demeanor, everyone's excitement cooled down.</p>
<p>This was a young woman who had graduated and come to work three years ago. It was said that she was still a maiden with no suitor. But what surprised me was that since she came to work, except for Sundays, among the large pile of letters that the postman delivered every morning, there was always a pink letter addressed to this woman. On the envelope, besides the address written in ink and her name, there was only the surname of the sender. But the strength of the handwriting was obviously from a man's hand. Sometimes, although this pink letter did not arrive in the morning, it would arrive promptly at 2:30 in the afternoon. After three or four months of this, everyone gradually began to pay attention. Although no one had the courage to secretly open it and peek at the secret, it was undoubtedly a love letter filled with honey-like sweetness. Therefore, some busybodies gave this woman a nickname, "Pink Envelope." When referring to her behind her back, everyone unanimously abolished the title of Miss and called her Pink Envelope.</p>
<p>Year after year, the delivery of pink letters could be said to have never been interrupted. Although no one ever knew who was sending the pink letters, everyone had an inexplicable envy for the sender. And on weekends, everyone who went to the park, watched movies, or went to the dance hall, kept an eye out, wanting to discover her whereabouts and catch a glimpse of the true face of the Pink Envelope's lover. But the result was nothing. Therefore, Pink Envelope became a mysterious puzzle among colleagues.</p>
<p>However, just three months ago, the delivery of pink letters had only stopped for half a month, when Pink Envelope suddenly resigned. Everyone thought that her love had matured and she was getting married. Unexpectedly, a week after she resigned, news suddenly came that this woman was involved in a pink lawsuit. It was said that the other party had been pursuing her for three years, that the number of love letters had reached one thousand, and that several kinds of relationships had occurred in between. As a result, it was discovered that her lover was actually a married man and the father of three children. During the lawsuit, she further presented evidence that she was still under the age of twenty.</p>
<p>Although this lawsuit was delayed for more than two months, it was finally settled under certain conditions. But to what extent has the Pink Envelope faded?</p>
<h3>Rats Eat Cats</h3>
<p>— Nuoxia (Cowardly Hero)</p>
<p>Recently, the "Domestic News" section of this newspaper published a piece of news about "rats eating cats" in Lin'an, Zhejiang, which was quite amusing. This reminded me of a similar incident that I had previously encountered in Guangzhou. Now I will write it down to join in the fun. The fact is this:</p>
<p>In the Wuxiandong area of ​​Guangzhou, there was a general store. Every two or three days, a bundle of loaches would go missing. At first, the shop owner thought that the employees were stealing them to sell, but there was no evidence, so he did not say anything. Later, after closing the shop, he spied from the cracks in the floor upstairs. After everyone had fallen asleep, he suddenly saw a black rat as big as a pig jump onto the counter, stand up, drag away a hanging bundle of loaches, and escape. After several observations, he realized that it was coming in from the water pit in the kitchen. The nest was in a hole under an old city wall nearby. The shop owner could not catch it, so he offered a reward. Anyone who brought their cat and could kill the rat would be given fifty dollars, and he would be willing to pay two hundred dollars to buy his cat. Before long, a Tanka (a boat dweller) led a male cat weighing about thirteen pounds that looked like a tiger to respond. Who knew that that night, the huge cat would be eaten half way by the rat. In the end, a farmer brought a female cat that he had raised for more than twenty years and weighed more than nineteen pounds from his hometown of Zhongshan County. However, in the fight, the cat bit the rat's throat tightly, and the rat pressed down on the cat's body. As a result, both of them died. This matter spread throughout the city. At that time, someone weighed the dead rat, and it weighed as much as thirty-seven pounds. In the hole where it was hiding, countless leftover loaches were also found.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting the Jade Exhibition Preview</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The items collected for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition this time were mostly jade, so a preview was held on the fourth floor of the Great New Company from March 5th. Eight wooden tables were specially set up in the exhibition hall, covered with tablecloths, and various products were placed on them separately. A palace-style pagoda and palace lantern archway were located in the center. The pagoda was one meter and twelve centimeters high, with seven levels, similar to the Longhua Pagoda. It was exquisitely detailed. The window railings on each level were carved with openwork patterns. The jade was lustrous, with mottled emerald green. The bells hanging on each of the eight corners were hollowed out from whole materials. The jade chains on the pagoda's top were as thin as lines, and the door stubs of each layer were precise to the millimeter. Electric torches were installed in the middle, emitting a faint, slow light, sometimes bright and sometimes dim, with switches for management. There were three layers of steps around, all decorated with round "longevity" character railings, connected by steps. To the left and right in front of the pagoda stood turtles and cranes facing each other, in the style of the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity in the old capital. The two palace lanterns were one-quarter of a meter in diameter, covered in green, without any flaws. They were engraved with four stories: Heavenly Maid Scattering Flowers, Magu Offering Longevity, Chang'e Flying to the Moon, and Magpie Bridge Meeting. The scenery was arranged according to the color of the jade, and the figures were vivid and lifelike. The archway was 41% of a meter high and more than half a meter wide. In the middle was the seal "First in Heaven and Earth," and on the left and right were carved the four characters "Overlapping Greens" and "Hollowed Greens." The surrounding areas were carved with double dragons playing with pearls and cloud cranes and other patterns. The materials were uniform, and the colors were bright and beautiful. It is said that these raw materials were obtained in 1915 by two miners, Li Benren and Liu Baochen, deep in the jadeite mountains of Burma. They weighed 8,000 kilograms and were dissected over several years into thirteen pieces of various sizes. Zhang Ruihua purchased five pieces, weighing 3,000 kilograms, obtaining 0.4 cubic meters of pure emerald. He believed that such extraordinary materials should be tested with extraordinary craftsmanship to create extraordinary treasures. Therefore, he recruited skilled craftsmen, obtaining 110 people, and spent eight of the ten years to carve the above three rare treasures. Jadeite is not comparable to gold, silver, or ivory. Knives and saws cannot penetrate it, and carving is very difficult. It requires delicate workmanship in polishing. One careless mistake can lead to immediate failure. Therefore, when the above three items were exhibited at the New York Exhibition in 1933, visitors were amazed and speechless, all praising the superb Eastern art. Other items, such as the crystal Queen Mother Longevity Star vase, the amber Cowherd and Weaver Girl screen, the emerald Eight Oddities in Water jar, and the coral Guanyin on Ao Fish statue, were all carved with great realism and spirit. There was also a pair of emerald magnolia pendants, only two inches long, one red and one green, carved with a picture of Mulan in military attire, holding a horse and wielding a spear, with a majestic and charming posture, lifelike, admired by all the viewers. Next to it was a place for inscriptions, with cold gold Xuan paper mounted into albums, signed by Liang Hancao, inviting celebrities to inscribe. Huang Renzhi wrote sixteen characters: "Heaven or man? A rare treasure. As cut, as polished. Not precious, but clever." Xiao Mo wrote a quatrain: "Bright crystal emerald is exquisite, jade pagoda and coral gain artificiality. Competing to see ten thousand families in awe, who can compare with treasure mountains and golden valleys?" Pan Gongzhan heard that the pagoda, palace lanterns, and archway were said to be sold after being exhibited in Paris this time, and was afraid that they would be acquired by foreigners. He advocated inviting comrades from all walks of life to donate 2,000 national currency units per person, raising funds to purchase them and display them in the Shanghai Museum.</p>

<h3>Cherry Blossoms and Japan</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan, blooming in mid-April, a crimson haze, exceptionally beautiful. The Japanese love them like their own lives. Wherever the Japanese set foot, there are cherry blossoms. Other emblems, trademarks, advertisements, decorative patterns, etc., all use cherry blossoms. Cherry blossoms bloom from budding to falling petals in less than half a month. Taiwan is close to the tropics, and flowers bloom the earliest. Cherry blossoms appear in mid-January, while in Hokkaido, Japan, mountain cherries are only seen in July and August. Therefore, Britain has the bold saying, "There is not a time on the flag when the sun does not shine," and Japan has the saying, "There is not a season in a year when cherry blossoms cannot be seen."</p>
<p>According to the research of Japanese botanist Dr. Makino, cherry blossoms are not unique to Japan. They are also distributed in southwestern Asia. The Himalayan cherry blossoms on the Himalayas are also quite beautiful. There is also Jeju Island in Korea, a small mountain. Fifteen years ago, it was discovered that there were also Tokyo Somei-Yoshino cherries there. So it is possible that Japanese cherry blossoms were imported from Korea. The original Japanese cherry blossoms were all wild mountain cherries, which are dark red with single petals. Later, they gradually mutated into double and double petals, and the color also faded to the same as light red.</p>
<p>Japan believes that cherry blossoms symbolize their samurai, but no one can explain the reason clearly. People who have been to Japan all believe that cherry blossoms and Japanese women harmonize well, and their enchanting lightness contains extremely tempting magic. Among the three elements of color, aroma, and taste, cherry blossoms lack aroma. They bloom quickly and fall quickly, and are probably more short-lived than peach blossoms. Their bright and lush appearance during full bloom is unmatched by other flowers. But after reaching their peak, their withering is imminent.</p>
<p>Once a year, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, people carry wine to enjoy the flowers, as if crazy, doing their best to enjoy themselves. Foreigners who come to Japan for sightseeing also come during this period. Therefore, the next World Games will be held in Japan, and the meeting period must be in mid-April. Because Japan has the most cherry blossoms, maple leaves, and pine trees, and the interest in viewing maple leaves and pine trees is not as good as enjoying cherry blossoms. The most popular places for cherry blossoms in Tokyo are Asukayama and Koganei, and other parks and shrines also have them. The most common cherry blossom in Tokyo is the Somei Yoshino cherry. Somei is the name of a suburb of Tokyo. During the Tokugawa era, there were flower gardens there, but now there are no traces left. Yoshino is a mountain name, and it is still a famous place for cherry blossoms. Before Emperor Jinmu of Japan, he loved cherry blossoms. There was a goddess named Konohanasakuya-hime. The two characters "Konohana" probably refer to cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>The Taiwan cherry blossoms in Atami bloom in mid-January, and the color is very strong. They were transplanted from Taiwan. Taiwan used to belong to our country, but we have not heard of cherry blossoms in the Chinese mainland. This is very strange. Our cherries are very similar to cherry blossoms, and they may be a type of cherry blossom. Botanists may be able to investigate the process of their transformation. In the three northeastern provinces, Qingdao, Suzhou, Qingyang, and the Hongkou area of ​​Shanghai, countless beautiful cherry blossoms are planted. When they are in full bloom, many idlers also wander among the geta crowds to admire them. And a few cold plums on Gushan Mountain that have endured wind and frost are still waiting for next year's plum-blossom tour bus.</p>
<h3>Swapped Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve (White Paper Red Letter Empty Return Two Lines of Tears Reed Flowers and Maple Leaves Walk Alone Half the City in Autumn)</p>
<p>Looking at enthusiastic people with a cold eye, one probably sees more and more clearly. Conversely, for enthusiastic people to escape cold eyes, the more they escape, the more hesitant they appear. At this time, Guoji and Zhu Xiaosong were sitting opposite each other in silence, and a bit of unnaturalness was revealed on their faces. Xiaosong smiled: Guessing based on the words in the poem, I feel that I am not wrong. Even if I am wrong, I will ask you how the novel is structured if these poems are to be inserted into the novel? Guoji said: You can see it in the poem, why ask me again? Seeing that he didn't reveal anything, Xiaosong held the manuscript in his hand and read it again in a low voice, then said: I guess it's like this, right? A young man accidentally meets a young woman and falls in love at first sight. So from that day on, he has to wait for that young woman to pass by every day, no matter how busy he is, he can't forget this. But that young woman doesn't pay attention to this young man. From spring to autumn, no matter how much this young man pays attention to her, she ignores him completely. And this young woman is a little angry, so... Guoji quickly stopped him, raising his hand, and said: Wrong, wrong. If that woman is angry, this man will still go to see her (that is equivalent to a rascal behavior. These two people don't know each other, but it is the woman who admires the man's literary name first. Xiaosong said? According to the poem, it is clear that the two people have never spoken. How does that woman know that the man she met is the one she admires in her heart? Guoji said: That is known through correspondence. Xiaosong's face did not show any smile, and his eyes were still focused on the manuscript. Then he asked casually: But I don't know whether the man first communicated with the woman, or the woman first communicated with the man? (147)</p>

<h3>Flying Kites and Kicking Shuttlecocks</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>Reading the news about promoting kite flying and shuttlecock kicking competitions, I can't help but recall my precious childhood. In the countryside, these were the two most suitable sports in spring and winter. (Or rather, games.) In spring, before the busy farming season began, many children gathered, and adults were sometimes happy to join in, competing to fly kites on the high hills. The sound of shouting would often drown out the cuckoo's "Every family cuckoo." In winter, after the rice had just been harvested, the farm was full of sunshine. The golden chicken feathers from chickens slaughtered by families for ancestor worship were snatched by the children to make shuttlecocks. So while the adults talked about this year's harvest under the sun, the children were happy for the shuttlecocks again.</p>
<p>That kind of situation seems to have passed very far away, and having escaped from the countryside into the living circle of Shanghai, everything I have witnessed is disappointing: Even if it's kite flying and shuttlecock kicking, the children who live in the concessions (of course, another generation) don't have that kind of blessing, because there are "electric wires" in the concessions, and kite flying is prohibited. Occasionally, some children still buy a small kite and fly it on a secluded road, but the lovely spring breeze is blocked by the roofs of tall buildings. The kite only twitches twice in their hands before hitting the gutter, either shattered to pieces or riddled with holes. Instead of spending the money begged for candy on nothing, it is better to go to the candy stall at the alley entrance to play "civet cat swapping for crown prince."</p>
<p>Shuttlecocks don't seem to have been banned, but there are too many games that tempt children in Shanghai. Playing "civet cat swapping for crown prince" is one example. And in those high-end alleys (mostly called "villages" or "villas"), there are rubber-wheeled cars and roller skates. The shuttlecock has been eliminated too far.</p>
<p>However, there are adults kicking shuttlecocks in Shanghai. They make a living in entertainment venues, kicking a shuttlecock in many fancy ways to win the favor of the money-spending bosses. He often kicks so hard that he is covered in sweat on stage, and when the audience shouts "One more!", he has no choice but to "Do one more." This seems to be far from the original purpose of "exercise."</p>
<p>This is one thing. Shanghainese seem to never pay attention to exercise. To take a walk in the park, you have to spend a dollar to buy an entrance ticket called a "pass." They listen to the whistles in the factories or the alarm clocks at home! They are only reminded of the time to wake up when they are sleeping! They only remember "how to work" and "how much to pay," and simply don't have the extra time to study what kind of exercise to do.</p>
<p>So there was a time when I even wanted to "return to the countryside" so that I could enjoy a little of the freedom that had been taken away from me in the concessions. But the children in the countryside have also changed. At the same age when we were flying kites and kicking shuttlecocks, they also helped their fathers work in the fields, and my companions of the same age beat their wives at home, as if they had all changed into different people, and could no longer think of such interesting games! Flying kites and kicking shuttlecocks.</p>
<p>Now it is spring again, and many families are preparing "seed money" to bet on the hopes of this year, and in Shanghai? Advertisements for spring tour buses have also been seen in the newspapers early on.</p>
<p>When will we be able to see kites flying freely in the sky again?</p>
<h3>Night at Sea</h3>
<p>— Lu Jia</p>
<p>Rocking, drifting into the deep night sea, the small fishing boat has black sails, black gunwales, and a black-kerchiefed fisherwoman sits by the rudder at the stern.</p>
<p>The sea is not tranquil; even the heavy night cannot suppress its churning. Waves, laden with weight, roar against the fragile gunwale. Foam splashes into the boat, onto the old fisherman at the bow, mending his nets.</p>
<p>Cold—</p>
<p>The cold wind, the cold spray penetrate the holes in his cotton-padded coat. Even muscles tempered in wind and waves cannot endure this piercing, cold dampness!</p>
<p>The torn net slips from his hands several times because the old fisherman's hands are frozen; the boat, floating on the wave crest, pitches wildly, preventing him from standing firm on his trembling legs as he used to.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The wind fills the sails; the red lamp at the masthead cannot illuminate the sea's secrets.</p>
<p>Beside the fisherwoman is also a swaying oil lamp, struggling against fate in the wind and waves. In the terrifying angry sea, the lamp, the old fisherman, the fisherwoman, and the small boat offer each other solace and companionship. They share the same fate.</p>
<p>The fisherwoman is motionless, the wind lifting her headscarf and fluttering it behind her head. No matter how the waves leap onto her face, onto the oilcloth covering her, she stubbornly grips the helm. In the light that barely illuminates her face: a face full of water droplets, a face of perseverance and the solemnity of a martyr. Her teeth clench her lower lip, also biting a strand of hair that has fallen from her forehead. Her eyes, petrified, stare at the bow; at the bow, the old fisherman's stooped figure dissolves into the ink-splashed sea and night, making it difficult to discern with the eyes.</p>
<p>The old fisherman looks up to the sky, murmuring, unsure whether he is cursing or praying. But his voice is drowned out by the howling of the wind and waves and the roar of the sea dragon, and the sky is sealed with thick black clouds, so no word can reach the ears of the gods.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a ghastly green lightning flash, like a cold arrow or a shiver, pierces through the accumulated layers of black clouds, stabbing the sea's dark face. The light flashes on the jagged, uneven sea; the waves pile up like lead blocks, from the gunwale to the horizon. Thunder rumbles past.</p>
<p>The lightning causes terror in people's hearts. The fisherwoman sees the sea reveal its dark face—that immeasurable face full of sinister secrets, as if the gaping mouth that had swallowed her husband near the gunwale was opening again, waiting for a second feast.</p>
<p>(Not long ago, her husband had easily ventured out into the furious sea in the tenth lunar month, while she waited on the shore with a lantern, until dawn, when he still had not returned.)</p>
<p>(Her five-year-old son, Liu'er, woke up in the morning and could not see his grandfather or mother.)</p>
<p>Not daring to let her thoughts drift further, she cried out:</p>
<p>"Father-in-law: Let's go back!"</p>
<p>Accompanied by a gust of wind, an aged voice came. Although stubborn, it also suppressed the trembling.</p>
<p>"Look, Liu'er's mother—it's a west wind and the tide is ebbing, how can we go back?"</p>
<p>"But…" The daughter-in-law fell silent, thinking of the empty pot tomorrow, lowered her head, hot tears mixed with water droplets on her cold cheek.</p>
<p>The sea wind continued to roar, the night seemed heavier.</p>
<h3>New Building Completed for the U.S. Department of the Interior</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>Everything Works with "Robots"</p>
<p>The newly constructed building of the U.S. Department of the Interior has now been completed, equipped with all kinds of exquisite machinery of the new era, making it arguably America's most unique new building. In a few weeks, when Secretary of the Interior Ickes and his 3,000 staff members move in, almost all tasks, except those requiring brainpower, can be performed by "robots." Every room has an automatic air circulation system, and even when the sun is shining brightly, the air is cooler than in the shade. There are a total of thirty-six air circulation zones, all of which can be automatically controlled. In winter, the air becomes warm and humid, and in summer, it becomes cool. Eight thousand five hundred gallons of water are used per minute to cleanse the air for the workers. The main furnaces that generate heat have automatic on/off mechanisms. Because "robots" are used to regulate the temperature, heating costs can be reduced by 15% to 20%. However, when the weather is at zero degrees, the furnaces still burn 3.5 tons of coal per hour. The base floor of this building has an area of 1.1 million square feet. Because many security mechanisms are installed, only thirty guards are needed to patrol. Wherever an alert occurs inside the building, a "robot" rushes to that location and sends a signal to the security headquarters, ensuring that the lower-level command knows. If the situation is serious, it will also alert the city's fire department to be on standby. Most of the "robots" are powered by heat, but many are connected to complex machinery that can perform various ingenious operations. Currently, only one other government agency has "robots" that are even more cleverly designed, and that is the newly constructed document repository building. The "robots" inside use "electric eyes." The nation's valuable documents are stored in this repository, making it completely secure. The new Department of the Interior building has a "robot" department located on a half-floor between the fifth and sixth floors, looking like an operating room in a hospital, painted white. All heating, electricity, and telephones are installed in pipes, with no visible traces on the outside. The telephones use the latest automatic system. Every piece of equipment prioritizes convenience first, followed by aesthetics. The internal structure is designed in advance for repairs, painting, and cleaning to avoid difficulties later. The main building has a total of two thousand rooms. There are six separate buildings on the left and right sides, and each room faces the outside, with ample air and sunlight. The construction of this building cost a total of US$13 million.</p>
<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>The sky is pale gray. Looking up through the dust-laden air, you appear like a pool of damp salt grains.</p>
<p>My heart seems to be soaked in this pool of salt grains, feeling numb. My head is dizzy and heavy, not knowing where to place it. Within the dazed feeling, there is sometimes a burst of pain, causing the muscles in my body to tremble and shrink together.</p>
<p>Truly uneasy. Lying in bed, I indulge in wild thoughts. Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? I heard adults say that several generations in my family died of this disease. Not long ago, the doctor even told me to pay attention to these symptoms. — I am a bit afraid; my heart is racing.</p>
<p>For several weeks, the weather has been erratic. One day it is warm, like spring, but the next day it is terribly cold, and even with several layers of clothing, I cannot withstand the cold wind. But, others say: cerebral hemorrhage has no major connection with this kind of weather, so what's going on?</p>
<p>The street is very quiet; it seems like people have all been blown away by the wind.</p>
<p>I ran to a friend's house; he understands a little bit about medical knowledge. Perhaps he can tell me what I should do.</p>
<p>After I told him about my condition, he pulled my hand, looked at my tongue and throat, and touched my head, acting very much like a doctor. Afterwards, he carefully examined my hand.</p>
<p>"Could it be scarlet fever?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he pointed to the back of my hand. I don't know when so many small red spots appeared there. After he said that, I couldn't help but furrow my brow, staring at those very small spots, clustered together in groups of several! It seemed like they were holding a meeting, discussing how to kill me.</p>
<p>Thinking about it: almost right! Haven't the newspapers been saying these past few days that there are many cases of scarlet fever in the hospital? And, there have also been many deaths. It probably can't be wrong. It must be!</p>
<p>I stared at those little red spots, feeling unspeakably panicked. If I could, I would bite through the back of my hand and bite those little red spots out, but, there are also some on my body, so what can I do? Should I scrape all the skin off with a knife?</p>
<p>I paced back and forth in my friend's room, feeling somewhat better.</p>
<p>My friend stared at me blankly, his bright eyes covered by a gray net, his hair scratched until it was sadly disheveled, looking like a pile of withered grass in the wilderness, very desolate. He leaned his buttocks against the edge of the table, his two hands supporting his body, his mouth moving awkwardly, arguing:</p>
<p>"How can we get sick? — We!"</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua (7)</h3>
<p>— Chen He</p>
<p>Two years after Hong returned to his country, he fell ill and died. Sai left the Hong family and set down harsh conditions: "In the future, she must return to the South and not go to the North again, in the future, she must not demand anything from the Hong family, and in the future, she must not use her former name for publicity." Under the pressure of official power, Sai had no choice but to leave Beijing for Shanghai.</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>"It's precisely people like us who get sick."</p>
<p>I said helplessly. I felt even worse than before, simply not knowing what to do. The sky was even grayer, the salt grains tightly enveloping my heart.</p>
<p>Neither of us had any solution.</p>
<p>He told me that I should go to the hospital to get checked as soon as possible, saying that maybe there would be a solution. He heard that there was a hospital in Shanghai that specialized in treating patients with infectious diseases, only charging a small medical fee, and providing attentive care.</p>
<p>"Then you should go quickly! — This is not something to be taken lightly!" After saying that, he paused slightly, let his hands fall down in despair, and shook his head: "Damn it, today is Sunday!" Saying that, his body seemed to be paralyzed. In a weak tone, with a comforting feeling, he said, "You should just go back and rest first, you need to rest well."</p>
<p>Normally, he is always very quiet and steady, but today everything is out of balance.</p>
<p>Although I tried my best to suppress my own feelings, quietly comforting myself, saying: It can't be scarlet fever, and there won't be any danger, but, the more I said that, the more afraid I became, and the more I felt that I was deceiving myself.</p>
<p>The sky was simply covered by a tombstone, as if pieced together from slabs of stone, heavily pressing down on the earth, pressing on my chest.</p>
<p>My body felt so heavy that I didn't want to move. My throat felt hot and itchy. I raised my hands to look at them, the red spots had become even larger, clustering even more densely, as if they were about to break through the skin and jump out.</p>
<p>The night gradually deepened. I didn't want to eat anything, and I couldn't think about anything. Before my eyes, a cartoon-like character, "death," appeared. For a moment, it became as small as a grain of rice, retreated, but then it became large again, so large that it covered everything, the strokes of the character blurring, turning into a pitch-black sky.</p>
<p>I looked at the sky outside the window, which was as dark as "death" had become. The moon and stars were all occupied by it, and I was being caressed by it.</p>
<p>— What am I going to do? Tell me!</p>
<p>Broadcast</p>
<h3>Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>Ying She Drama Troupe</p>
<p>Jiaotong (1300) 5:00 PM to 5:40 PM</p>
<p>White Granulated Sugar</p>
<p>Smuggling is becoming increasingly rampant, and the market towns of Jiangnan are also greatly affected. Therefore, Mr. Li, the owner of the Demao Native Products Store, wants to convene a meeting of his peers to implore everyone to work together to resist foreign white granulated sugar.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the play, Mr. Li's wife and daughter are peeling lotus seeds and lilies, preparing to cook them to entertain guests. The mother complains that Mr. Li is going to spend money again to invite guests. The daughter explains to her mother that the purpose of inviting guests this time is to discuss ways to rescue the sugar market because the price of silk cocoons has plummeted, and the villagers are so poor that they are like dried toads, not having money to go to the market to buy goods, so they buy smuggled goods to save money. But the mother does not believe that smuggling will have any impact on the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Li is an honest man. Because smuggling has squeezed his business, he has become as patriotic as his daughter. But he thinks everyone is as honest as he is, so he doesn't believe that Mr. Wang, the owner of the Yulong Native Products Store, will take the opportunity to buy a batch of foreign white granulated sugar to steal his business! He only wants to cover up the sluggishness of his store's business, telling the clerks to make the sound of coins dropping louder when customers come. But he does not pay attention to the student anti-smuggling team from Shanghai who are going to the countryside.</p>
<p>Li Huaying's classmate comes, saying that the anti-smuggling team will gather at the train station immediately, telling her to go right away.</p>
<p>Guests arrive one by one. Mr. Gao cannot come because of business, so he sends his son Rongtang to represent him. Mr. Wang comes in second; Mr. Liu follows him in. So they sit down to discuss the issue of resisting foreign white granulated sugar. Mr. Li is not very good at speaking, so Li Huaying speaks on his behalf about the relationship between smuggling and saving the country. This wins the sympathy of Gao Rongtang. Mr. Wang also pretends to agree cunningly. Mr. Liu only praises Li Huaying for being eloquent.</p>
<p>Regarding their opinions on anti-smuggling: Mr. Liu believes that Chinese yellow sugar and white sugar do not have good sales appeal, so they cannot resist foreign goods, and that things must be done carefully. Gao Rongtang has a strong personality and wants to immediately establish an anti-smuggling team to inspect households one by one. Mr. Wang, on the other hand, wants to use delaying tactics to slowly organize the anti-smuggling team so that he can sabotage it from within. At this time, an employee of Yulong runs in frantically and whispers to Mr. Wang. Their actions are noticed by Li Huaying, so she secretly runs out to report to the student anti-smuggling team.</p>
<p>When the women want to return the goods to the Demao store and go to buy cheaper smuggled goods, a crowd at the train station injures people while searching for smuggled goods. The crowd also arrests the employee of Yulong and makes him confess that Mr. Wang is a treacherous merchant who secretly sells smuggled sugar.</p>
<p>Finally, Li Huaying returns injured, takes out rayon, and explains to everyone the reasons why Chinese sugar and Chinese silk cocoons cannot be sold at a good price: all because of smuggled goods. Everyone is moved and vows not to eat foreign white granulated sugar anymore. Even Mr. Liu is willing to seal up the small amount of foreign white granulated sugar in his store.</p>

<p>Zhu Yaoxiang and Zhao Jiaqiu "Double Pearl Phoenix"</p>
<p>Shanghai (1100) 4:00 PM to 4:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Pearl Pagoda, Passing the Imperial Examination"</p>
<p>Cassia fragrance divides a branch in the toad palace. Passing the imperial examination, a new scholar enjoys the spring in the apricot garden. Ten thousand selected copper coins present collected scrolls. Judging talent, the emperor's brush first inscribes a name. Three hundred heroes of the Qujiang River generation actually followed me to Pengying. Throwing fruit on the streets is better than An Ren. The beautiful story of the three champions is the same as Shang Lu. Counting the days, descendants rise up in the jade forest. Unexpectedly, a failed scholar harbors injustice. The grass is short and sparse. He strikes the Dengwen drum. He speaks of Sanqiao, Bi Ding, and Fang Qing. In an instant, an imperial edict is declared at the noon gate. Fang Qing cries bitterly in grief. He presents his grandfather's grievances to the emperor. Therefore, he returns to his original home to report the situation. The loyal and good are succeeded by heavenly joy. The ancestral property is returned with a decree. Boundless is the grace of the imperial rain and dew. Especially because he spent his youth in poverty. Golden lotus precious candles are bestowed to complete the marriage. Moreover, embroidered clothes point directly to patrol on behalf of the heavens. Temporarily resigning from the ranks of mandarin ducks and egrets. The Qin generation plays the phoenix in response to the flute. A high carriage and four horses leave the capital.</p>
<p>Jiang Yuequan "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Yuanchang (1480) 11:15 PM to 12:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber, Xichun Painting"</p>
<p>Petite and exquisite, I buy Xichun. Painting and identifying, the brush conveys the spirit. The Da Guan Garden draft is infinitely wonderful. He is. Intentionally seeking fine workmanship in every style. Opening up a peach list and adding painting brushes. Pairing all the colors requires a thousand gold. Buying Song silk and grinding it smooth. It takes a month of effort to complete. Look at him. Arranging pavilions and terraces with a fine structure. The chest hides hills and valleys, a good painting of gardens. Let him. Lush flowers and trees waving the brush to paint. Let him. Beasts and birds embellished with refinement. Let him. Grinding ink and tempering glue to paint the mountains and stones. Let him. Pearl curtains and painted beams write layers. Let him. First describe the draft and then re-dye it. Let him. All day long, pondering and imitating, the wrist does not stop. It tires Xichun to often cry out in pain. I can only. Close the boudoir deeply and focus all my attention. It makes. The busy Baoyu without anything to do thinks about painting. Searching a dry stomach, I am humming in detail. Suddenly, I hear. The inscription is completed and the locust is offered for a big chew. For a time, the boudoir is filled with laughter. It is said that. Only Pin'er chews her tongue.</p>
