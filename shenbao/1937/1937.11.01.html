<h3>小南翔南北全線激戰我軍殲敵六百餘</h3>
<p>敵進犯太平庵已予擊退　我軍堅守陣地屹然未動　北新涇北岸我亦佔勝利</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者卅一日午後一時報吿、今晨四時半左右、敵由眞北路、衝過李宅、直迫黃家宅我陣地、我軍×團奮勇將其截斷、進出凡四五次之多、戰至上午八時左右、暫吿休戰、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者一日晨零時半報吿、昨晨二時半起、小南翔南北全綫、又起激戰、延長時間至五小時、我軍正面突擊、將敵殲滅六百餘人、午後二時、敵又增援來犯、亦卽為我擊退云、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者、一日晨零時半報吿、北新涇北岸、我軍與敵相持四日、大小戰達二十次、我軍均佔勝利、作日午後三時半、敵又以四千餘人之衆、助以機械化部隊向我來犯、卽經我軍截擊、將敵分隔數段、各個痛擊、敵軍見勢不佳、畏怯退去、</p>
<p>中央社云、軍息、敵積極進犯我小南翔至江橋一綫陣地、昨日淸晨起、卽以飛機大砲聯合火力、向我轟擊、近午時、砲聲稍稀、敵卽以大隊向我全綫猛撲、惟均為我擊退、小南翔江橋鎮兩據點、始終在我軍堅守中、且全綫陣地、亦絕無變動、傍晚時又起激烈之砲戰、惟敵步兵、則未再來犯云、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者三十一日晚十時報吿、小南翔至江橋一段、敵仍猛攻不已、本日午後、敵又在大砲飛機掩護下、向江橋以北我太平庵之點進犯、我軍咸冒砲火奮勇衝擊、激戰至夜、我軍陣地屹然未動、</p>
<h3>昨日敵軍數次偷渡蘇州河</h3>
<p>在北新涇周家橋兩點　經我軍痛擊後未得逞</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍連日由蘇州河北岸、以大砲向我南岸陣地砲擊、並以飛機多架在沿河各村鎭肆意轟炸其步兵數次試渡、均經我軍擊退昨晨乘天雨霧重、並施放烟幕掩護、又圖偷渡、惟渡過約八十人後、我軍卽予迎頭痛擊、殱滅大半、其殘部狼狽退去、午後二次偸渡、則未得逞、旋雙方砲擊、入晚未止、據本社隨軍記者昨晚十時七分報吿戰况如下、</p>
<h3>兩岸全般形勢</h3>
<p>敵我在蘇州河兩岸相持之區域、自滬杭鐵路以西至申紀浜為止、長約七公里、其中自鐵路至周家橋約為一公里、其間有橋兩座、惟均已為我軍炸毀、由周家橋至北新涇長約二公里半、河身平直、兩岸多廠房村落、可藉作據點、由北新涇至申紀浜約程三公里半、河身曲折、北岸且多港汶、就地勢論、北新涇一段河岸、北高南低、而西段港汶旣多、偸渡較易、敵前次偸渡、卽由西頭庵以小艇經潘家港而入蘇州河者、故我軍對該兩處及港汶口戒備尤爲嚴密、</p>
<h3>初渡被我消滅</h3>
<p>昨晨黎明時、天雨多霧、敵機不能活動、乃施放烟幕、敵軍約百人、由北新涇之對岸渡過蘇州河、其行動雖甚詭秘、惟在未立穩陣地時、卽被我軍截擊、敵背河頑抗、當爲我殱滅大半、殘部倉皇逃去、至午後一時、又發現對岸馬家宅集有敵軍約一聯隊、似又有偸渡模樣、我軍卽以迫擊砲猛轟、連中多彈、敵傷亡甚重、狼狽四散、終未能照原定計劃進行、</p>
<h3>下午又被痛擊</h3>
<p>午後一時、敵又在周家橋方面施放烟幕、掩護渡河後、並强建浮橋、我軍突起襲擊、相持於沿岸一帶、激戰至晚七時、殘敵僅剩十餘人無法退去、卽可全部解决、三时許、北岸姜家宅亦有敵約四五十人、渡至南岸劉家宅、我軍早作凖備、俟其登岸未及散開時、立衝出圍擊、卽將其殱滅、至午後四時許、天时轉晴、敵機出動窺察甚久、並投數彈、而雙方砲擊則入夜未停、</p>
<h3>西區激戰甚烈</h3>
<p>昨午三時許戰事最為激烈、記者曾冒險前往觀戰、當經租界西區時、砲聲正密、路上行人稀少、均面呈憂色、偶見有携箱挈筐向東遷避者、惟為數尚不多、迨抵目的地、距火綫僅數百公尺、人跡已絕、惟軍警數人駐守、市街淸寂、槍砲尤覺刺耳、旋登高遠矚、但見烟霧繚繞、與雲天相接、茫茫一片、亘延數里、沿河兩岸、並有三處着火延燒正烈、火光熊熊向上穿騰、至機槍之聲、則忽斷忽續、起於遠處反不及大砲聲之密集緊張約四時後、雨止、敵偵察機一架、盤旋數匝、惟經我軍以高射砲轟擊、有一次似已擊中、該機忽向北趨降至敵陣地後、卒又掙扎升起、惟以後則不敢低飛云、</p>
<h3>我空軍昨轟炸敵軍</h3>
<p>敵移動甚忙我投十餘彈</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晚六時許、我空軍冒雨來滬偵察敵軍陣地、敵軍雖以高射砲射擊、惟不猛烈、我機經過閘北時、見敵軍移動甚忙連投十餘彈、當有數處起火、敵軍損失甚重云、</p>
<h3>前晚昨晨浦江砲戰激戰</h3>

<h3>我忠勇之四百孤軍退出閘北印象</h3>
<p>官佐多人述攻守經過　大美晚報紀退出眞相</p>
<p>孤守閘北一百二十餘小時之八十八師謝團楊營壯士三百七十七人、（此外尚有受傷者二十六人及重傷者數人）於昨晨二時十分、奉令忍痛退出四行倉庫後、業由安全地帶、移往某地休養、記者曾隨謝團赴某處、得悉該營全體孤守四行奮鬥殺敵經過、爰誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>昨晨二時離去四行</p>
<p>孤守閘北之我軍因奉蔣委員長密令乃於昨晨二時十分、整理機彈糧秣、從容離去孤守四日之四行倉庫、離去之時、敵方砲火正烈、蓋四日來攻擊毫無結果、乃以平射砲等猛烈火器、集中猛轟、但我軍已奉到撤退命令、不動聲色、預先戒備、由團附謝晋元•及營長楊瑞符二氏、親自押隊維護、其時謝團附、並留三十餘人機關槍手、在四行附近對敵方攻擊部隊加以還擊、至三時許完全撤退、</p>
<p>受傷壯士繼續奮鬭</p>
<p>因部隊衆多、撤退非易、又以敵方砲火兇惡、致維護部隊三十餘人、謝團長身受微傷、楊營長傷及足部脚踝骨、但仍奮勇殺敵、不稍後退、至三時一刻許、維護隊伍均隨謝楊二氏、退至安全地帶</p>
<p>殉難忠骸??氣長存</p>
<p>我軍退出、敵方毫未知悉、仍用猛烈砲火攻擊、至半小時後、敵軍見無動靜、始派大批敵軍摸索而進因憤我軍連日迭予重創、乃縱火焚燒、迄昨日下午、火勢猶未熄滅、當闖出時、我軍維護部隊有一人受創過重殉國犧牲於四行門首、昨日中午十二時、全營轉某地靜養．短期內卽歸隊趕赴前綫繼續為國効命、記者於午後一時赴某處詢問、至午後六時返社、得悉我軍於二十七日以來攻守情况如左、</p>
<h3>五日以來攻守情形</h3>
<p>據該營官佐多人向記者稱、此次我軍孤守閘北、爲時至暫、奉命退出、蒙中外各界人士優予奬勉、非常愧感、惟有努力前途、難以報謝、又各方同胞義賜慰勞品、多至不可計數、實深愧疚、盼各界今後將買慰勞品的錢、改買救國公債、則無異在前方殺敵、我軍於廿七日晨留守四行到現在、敵日夜不斷攻擊、我等早抱必死之信念、除為國盡最後責任、流最後一滴血外、不求其他、敵第一日淸晨不知我駐有如許隊伍、因輕率從事、有數敵携敵旗攀登四行屋頂、我軍以精銳部隊、駐於二樓門口、立將敵擊斃、乃派少數部隊至底層將門窗關緊、敵知有備、遂以火油等物澆灌、以謀焚燒、但該處我早有鞏固工事、且四行係鋼骨水泥所構築、敵陰謀失敗、遂在門首架設機關槍、此處我軍從前設有步哨沙袋、敵乃在沙袋上架設機槍、向我屋頂射擊、我軍以手溜彈、機關槍掃去、敵三人立斃、嗣我亦未衝殺、敵之機關槍亦卽拋置其間、從此不敢拖去、至廿七深夜、敵又偸偸摸摸、我鄭重警戒、未生變故、</p>
<p>第二天築堅固工事</p>
<p>第二天敵方乃在上海銀行、江蘇銀行瑞大木行以平射砲攻擊、擬毀我工事、我除以墻壁為天然防禦物外、為避免意外計、並加築工事、且在屋頂設置掩護物、敵屡次攻擊不得逞、於是用飛機威脅、我軍在極堅固工事之下、從高處射擊、二天內斃敵五十餘人、是晚、得市商會童子軍之獻旗、又得各界援助後、全營同志、更感興奮、勇上加勇、乃於當晚以平射砲向敵攻擊、是時敵方已陷無可奈何之境、故除猛射機槍外、敵兵從未敢逼近五十米突之內、至二十九日晨、敵又以平射砲專射我三樓及各樓窗口、我軍鎮定如常、置之不睬、入晚、我軍又發神勇、將敵方摸索部隊個別解决、至是敵死傷已逾六七十人、</p>
<p>一度衝至上行堆棧</p>
<p>到三十日、敵方殺計百出、除以平射砲、機槍及手溜强猛擲、並在蘇州河畔擬以遊艇攻擊、但我决不因此稍怯、我同志多人、並於黑夜搜索前進當夜、我軍且一度衝至上海銀行堆棧、敵方胆碎心驚、莫知所措、我本以消耗敵方之實力爲宗旨、於衝至上行後、乃整隊退回、</p>
<p>深夜淸晨奉命退出</p>

<h3>敵機兩日狂炸松江詳紀</h3>
<p>松江三十一日電、本月二十八二十九兩日、此間被敵機濫施轟炸、繁盛區域、盡被炸毁等情、曾誌本報、茲記者為求明瞭被炸之實况、及當地一切詳情計、特赴城鄕實地調査、經査得此間最繁盛之西門大街、除錢涇橋東、包家橋西、及新拓寬之長橋街一帶、於二十四日業被轟炸盡成瓦礫外、所有西城門口及城外、至馬路橋間店房住戶、炸毁殆盡、惟多數燬於裹埭、故門面仍頗完好、査該段中商店、均屬松地較大之字號店、且中國•農民•典業•新華•四銀行、及承大•裕康兩錢莊、全大•恒和兩典當、均創設於該段、損失殊屬不貲、至馬路橋西康永初家•缸甏行姜姓家•秀野橋杜晋泰•及痧神廟附近、均看彈炸毁、而以杜晋泰為甚、塔橋西九曲弄美國基督敎主辦之、</p>
<p>慕衛女學着彈燃燒　勢至猛烈、幸四面鄰居、得未殃及、同時馬各桥南上松汽車站及西城門口亦均起火、而以西門口之火勢最烈、是時適逢北風大熾、更難撲滅、其他如黑魚弄•莫家弄•楊家橋•妙嚴寺•石暉橋•諸行街•高家弄•後諸行街•竹竿匯•楊家弄等處、亦被炸毁、嶽廟大殿、新由道房中集資修建、亦毁損無餘、當西城門口着彈時、城門洞下、有數十行人、均隱避在內、被彈片炸死七八人、炸傷數十人、缺首斷足、慘不忍覩、至城內着彈尤多、自西門口起至楊家橋止、上下塘着彈十餘枚、而以大華印刷局毁損最甚、再東自襪子弄口起迄中心弄止、</p>
<h3>松江民房被炸慘狀</h3>
<p>— （戰影團攝）</p>
<p>所有房屋毀壞殆盡　其中自法院門前起至中心弄止一段、因以前曾一度被炸、故此次再遭轟炸後、房屋盡行倒坍、成為一片瓦礫塲、而縣府南、法院南、察院塲南、南內陸家橋、邱家灣、（天主敎主辦之正心中學亦被毁）及其他各小街、均分落一二彈、總之、西外及城內之大街小巷、十份之七、均着彈被炸、舉目四顧、一片凄凉松地精華、損毁六七、至死傷人數、不下二百餘人、均由松江紅分會、設法救護掩埋、現商店已全部閉歇、貧苦民家、甚至有錢無處糴米、而忍受飢餓、倭寇之慘無人道、殊足引起世人之共憤、至當地各機關、除專署王專員仍率屬照常在原處辦公、且頗努力外、餘均遷避他處、而各醫院醫生、亦均星散、院務停頓、故此次事出後、一切救護掩埋等工作、經紅分會獨力維持、惟以醫院遷避或停閉、致救護隊</p>

<p>時評</p>
<p>— 宜</p>
<h3>韌戰精神</h3>
<p>敵人攻陷了大塲和娘子關。滿以為垂手可得上海和太原了。可是我英勇的戰士們退到了新防綫。却更有精神地戰鬥着。他们堅决地要保衛大上海和保衛太原。非但不讓敵人再推進一步。還趁着任何機會攻進敵人的防綫去。</p>
<p>這種韌戰精神是最可寶貴最可頌讃的。其效果也已顯然可見了。就上海戰塲來說過去兩月餘中間。敵人想不到我軍戰鬥力那樣的强韌。進攻計劃失敗了許多次。到最後不得不拚着極重大的犧牲。採取迂迥突擊的戰略。可是我們閘北的防軍還是整師撤退了。敵人僅僅得到閘北的一片焦土。是决不能補償多次血戰的代價的。就山西戰塲來說。敵人打進了雁門雄關。却就遭遇了迭次的慘敗。現在忻口方面敵軍的主力已經陷於進退維谷的窮境了。而由晋東進援的敵軍也還是腹背受敵。無論如何。到今為止。兩戰塲的形勢都是極可樂觀的。而可樂觀的主要因素就在我們的軍隊表顯着韌戰精神。</p>
<p>大家知道。我們的最後勝利必須在持久的抗戰中間才可以取得。我相信我軍事當局所採取的。戰略一定也以維持韌戰精神為第一義。</p>

<h3>英報評論比京會議展望</h3>
<p>對美積極行動表示滿意　德外長聲明不出席理由</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於九國公約會議事、星期泰晤士報與觀察報分別加以評論、所具見解各不相同、泰晤士報鑒於美國不以觀察員名義參加會議、而以會員資格積極參加、因而表示滿意、幷謂、遠東和平樹立之後、歐洲各國酷愛和平、得以全副精神注意歐洲時局、歐洲和平因而得以鼓勵、其他各國所由設法延宕或阻撓遠東和平者、其故亦卽在此、觀察報則謂、“歐洲各國對於遠東時局侈談和平計劃、未免可笑、諺云、善舉當以自身享受爲始、和平之爲物、亦與善舉相同、歐洲和平倘非由歐洲各國有所努力、其對遠東和平自難有所貢獻云、（中央社卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙慕尼黑　德國外長牛賴特、今日在德國法律學院年會、發表演說、闡明德國對於九國公約會議之態度、首先解析集團政治意見、繼稱九國公約會議爲考盧解决國際糾紛方法之實際機會、德國未接受邀請者、因該會係用一九二二年九國公約之條款所召集、德國旣非簽字國、當然不能望其必定參加、但覆文已切實聲明、俟時機成熟、主要條件具備、則德國願意隨時參加調解中日衝突之合作、論及此項會議之展望、牛氏宣稱、國聯召集此會時、其所含集團政策之成份極少、其進行恐至不十分順利、余認各國無論對中日衝突之態度如何、但在調停戰事時、如居於道德裁判者之地位、則頗難達到調解之目的云、（三十日國民海通電）</p>

<p>⊙白魯塞爾　前財長德曼組閣失敗之後、國王利奧波德三世、乃命右派參議員奧凡倍組閣、但奧凡倍頃已予以謝絕、一般人現信國王將請前外長社會黨員斯巴克組織新閣、大約斯巴克當加以接受、並可望將新閣組織成立、蓋自由黨對於斯巴克、較諸德曼尤有好感也、如斯巴克謝絕組閣、則將請國會以外之人物担任組閣云、（中央社三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［羅馬］</p>
<p>關於意大利加入德日兩國反共恊定一層、一般觀察者以爲、截至目前爲止、官方並無何種表示、足以令人相信、有立卽、成爲事實之可能、至於日本意大利兩國負責人士、則始終拒絕發表任何消息、又日本前駐意國大使杉村陽太郞、調任駐法大使之前、曾與意國政府談判訂結意日兩國商約、惟此項商約、迄今並未簽字、因此、若干、士以爲、商約簽字延遲之原因、或當由於羅馬與東京間現正談判訂結政治條約、故俟政治條約成立之際、方乃同時成立商約云、惟意將僅參加德日兩國反共恊定、或另與日本單獨訂立恊定、此在政界人士尙無所聞、按去年德日反共恊定成立之際、意國不願加入該恊定、嗣後意國改變態度、而於本年初頭表示願意參加該恊定、然日本忽又表示不願、然至最近、遠東事變演進、日意兩國關係、已日見密切、故卽令兩國間成立政治恊定、對於兩國事實上之關係、亦無所增益也、（中央社卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意突然召回駐法大使</h3>
<p>歐洲揣測不安</p>
<p>［巴黎］意國駐法大使賽呂蒂頃正式通吿法國外交部、謂接奉本國政府訓令、准予“請假”返國、賽呂蒂定於明日午後啟程、遄返羅馬、據此間意國人士所知、該大使假期相當長久云、法國一般人以爲、意國政府此舉、乃使該國駐法外交代表與法國駐意外交代表處於對等地位、緣一年前、法國前駐意大使尙伯蘭退休之後、政府卽以外交部非洲司司長聖岡旦繼任、幷向意國政府徵求同意、意國雖加以贊同、但要求新大使到任時、其國書上款、須用“意大利國王阿比西尼亞皇帝陛下”字樣、法國則以國聯會會員國之立塲、自難加以接受、因此乃由駐意大使館參事白隆台爾充任代辦、以迄於今、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］意國駐法大使賽呂蒂急劇被召回國、歐洲各國爲之揣測紛然、巴黎方面尤爲驚異不置、據巴黎官方之解釋、意國此舉、實因羅馬缺少法大使之故、蓋法國駐意大使尙伯蘭、自在去年退休後、尙未有繼任者、而法國茍須派遣大使赴意、勢須承認意爲阿比西尼亞皇帝是也、復有說、上星期五、法國急進社會黨在列黎召集大會時各要人所發表之演說、已使墨索里尼大爲憤激、但此說現已不能成立、蓋意大使被召回國之時、此項演說詞尙未能傳達至羅馬也、杳急進社會黨大會席間、前總理赫里歐曾暗示、非洲方面不祥之進展、並問“巴爾瑪地方所懸之旗、吾人安知其爲西班牙旗”、而外長台爾博斯同時復將滿洲及阿比西尼亞事相提並論、謂條約之破壞、已使帝國主義膽為之益壯、而受威脅之國家益為之不安云、在羅馬非正式方面則認大使之召回、與兩國間去年一年之中友誼日漸敗壞之所致、並覺今日法意間感情之惡劣、業臻一九三五年法外長賴伐爾訪意後之極點、但在官傷方面則僅稱、賽呂蒂之回國、係因賽欲在羅馬度其耶誕假日云、再則外傳意方外交人員將有大批更動、而賽呂蒂擬與以其他任用、而駐法大使館則由代辦主持之云、（中央社三十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>閘北民房被敵縱火焚燒慘狀</h3>
<p>— （戰影團攝）</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>從“悲哀的文學”說到大衆的敎育</h3>
<p>— 陳望道</p>
<p>前天在某報上讀到沈起予先生寫的“論文悲哀的文學”大意是說：在這一回的抗戰事中，“根本有無數的悲哀事發生”，這該用來寫“悲哀的文學”。“表現這種眞實情感的文學，祇有激發人們由悲哀而憤怒，而壯烈，此外並沒有什麼不良影響”，而“虛僞着感情，勉强寫積極的作品”，“所見的大都是“四萬萬五千萬人如何如何”，末了是“最後勝利屬於我們的”的一套”，却又不見得“一定受人歡迎而發生良好結果”。文中對於後者，舉出了一位讀者的來信作證，而於前者，彷彿就以自己作證，說：</p>
<p>“我近來常常愛流眼淚，流在看見我空軍英勇夜襲的時候，流在看見作壯烈犧性的傷兵和無家可歸的難民的時候，而在自己妻離子散的時候，自然也是流過的。然而我並不曾因這些哀感而頹廢，而絕望，反之，正因此而益堅了我的心，如果有了任何機會，我都不惜在這挽救民族的途上一死。”</p>
<p>“不惜一死”是“壯烈”的，這樣壯烈的悲哀似乎並不是單單“悲哀”兩個字所能包括。“悲哀”，實際會有人“由悲哀而䫋廢，而絕望”，也會有人“由悲哀而憤怒，而壯烈”。這分別，在乎悲哀的感情是不是結着堅强的意志。粘結着堅强的意志的悲哀感情，才會是也壯也哀的感情，使人覺得悲哀苦痛，却又感得崇高雄偉的感情，就是所謂悲壯感。我國的文學上原來不少善於發抒悲壯情感描寫悲壯事實的文獻，現在又正是這種文學產生的時期。無數悲壯的事實正在不斷的出現，我們定會有無數悲壯的文學不斷的產生。</p>
<p>這幾天成千成萬的上海市民都在熱烈頌揚援助八百將士死守閘北孤壘，正是當然的，因為這正是無數悲狀事實當中一個大家最最看得明白清楚的悲壯事實，正是堅強的意志所產生的死要以弱抗强的一個典型事例。</p>
<p>表現這類大小事例的文學當然不該單將堅强的意志堆在紙上，將那悲哀的情緒一槪抹煞。但我們這一回的抗戰是太需要堅强的意志了•我們都被逼着不能不將自己練成不会輕易笑也不會輕易哭，好像鐵打銅鑄不易動搖的人。這在有些人是容易做到的，有些人却不容易做到，但也不能不遵守所謂“勝也不驕，敗也不餒”的號召，而且還將這號召，用了什麽一種形式去號召別人。來不及具體化，來不及情感化。這就形成了所謂“一套”。這“一套”的缺點，與其說是“虛偽着感情”，似乎還不如說是偏枯在概念。然而無論怎麽說，在文學上我是同意沈先生說的“寫得個性化一點”的。</p>
<p>然而在抗戰的意志上，在抗戰的認識上，我們却正要求着“一套”。我們正還愁“一套”得不够深入，不够普及。我們正還需要推行大衆的敎育，來開發大衆的認識，齊一大衆的意志。在這方面，表示决意定志的語句是不厭百回講，不厭百回喊，不厭百回唱的。斜對面那個學校裏的學生今晚唱“起來，不願做奴隸的人們！把我們的血肉，築成我們新的長城！”已經不知多少遍了，聽那越唱越起勁的聲氣，大約還要不知多少遍地唱下去。他們正在用不厭百回唱的方法，鍛鍊着自己，體騐着我們抗敵救亡運動的悲壯感。抗敵救亡是中華民族眼前生死大事，要有大胸襟來應付。我們對外須得結交最可靠的友邦，對內不能不喚起民衆，一致來參加抗爭。凡是在這上面不論多少有點貢獻的，便都多小可以認為力量。我們希望一切方面在這大事上頭放寬了一點成見，對於文學也是－樣。概念偏枯的文學，或者由於太想在這大衆敎育上盡力了的緣故，也未可知。或者由於生活太偏枯，未經體騐抗戰各種塲面的緣故也未可定。假如由於後者，自可隨同生活的改變而改變，“八一三”以來報吿文學的進步，便是一個顯證。假如由於前者，則似乎還不如不改初衷的好。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>關於九國公約會議事。倫敦泰晤士報與觀察報。分別加以評論。惟所具之見解。各有不同。泰晤士報主張。先樹立遠東之和平。然後樹立歐洲之和平。觀察報主張歐洲和平倘非由歐洲各國努力。對於遠東自難有所貢獻。易言之。欲樹立遠東之和平。必先樹立歐洲之和平也。以上兩說。雖各言之成理。然第一說較為切實允當。因遠東之和平。已經破裂。歐洲之和平。尚未破裂也。譬如治水。偶一堤潰。猛力堵塞。則事半功倍。若至泛濫洋溢。則無所措手矣。其實現在之局勢。已無先後可分。已無東西之別。大有㧞一髮而全身皆動之勢。但是此髮不除。後日根更深而底更固。卽欲㧞除此髮亦不可得矣。</p>

<h3>北新涇民房被敵機炸燬</h3>

<h3>最近日本之產業界</h3>
<p>— 時任</p>
<p>最近一二月間，日本產業界因受中日戰事之影響，除軍需工業或間接與軍需工業有關之產業，呈其活躍之恣態以外，其他產業，皆厥不振，尤其作為其立國之本的纖維工業，更因戰事而受了莫大的打擊。</p>
<p>在日本過去的貿易統計上看來，上半季多為入超季，下半季多為出超季，但今年七八二月却呈現出相反的事實，亦即自七月初到八月中旬，又入超了－億三千六百萬元，到了八月下旬，才出超了三百萬，誠如“大阪每日新聞”所說一般，事實尚未容樂觀。</p>
<p>按日本國際收支之適合，為其根本財政國策之一端，如此種現象，繼續無已，則非搖崩其國家之基磐不可，故商工省與法制局看到了此種危機，乃於八月下旬，制定了貿易管理法案，完全是戰時强制化的規則，共計八條。</p>
<p>㊀政府在事變與戰時之際,為確保國民經濟之運行起見，認為必要時，能很制或禁止某種物品之輸出入。</p>
<p>㊁政府在事發與戰時之際，為確保國民經濟之運行起見，對於需要調整需給關係之物品，在上例指令之權。A對以事項物品為原料之製品，有權力加以約束和制限。B關終該項物品之配給讓渡使用消費皆有權干涉，</p>
<p>㊂政府對於與第一次制限禁止或受過前次命令之處分有關係的，能徵其報告或同樣禁止之，</p>
<p>㊃——八為罰則。</p>
<p>由以上之管理法案窺之。可知日本之政府，已極力在限制一切非必要品的生產與輸入，而着目於入超的救濟了，但實際上，其最大的目的，則為軍需工業之提倡，對其他工業之抑壓。我們試看最近十天前發表的原料輸入制限法案，就能到其全體了。是案共計三條，現摘錄如下：</p>
<p>㊀制限像棉花羊毛輸岀工業之原料時，須以其輸岀量為比例，不使大量輸入。</p>
<p>㊁原料輸入以後，成為製品，因此等原料之暴騰，此種製品亦極暴騰，所以輸往外國傾銷，無利可圖，轉銷國內‥凡此種行為，應設法防止之。</p>
<p>㊂盡可能的從實行交換之國家，輸入原料，對其他國家則制限之。此種法案，幾乎專為針對羊毛與棉花之輸入而設者，因此羊毛與棉花之輸入，此法之統治引起絕大之打擊，日本之羊毛棉花的自給率，　百分之五左右，其他皆仰儉他國，一旦原料輸入受了統治應當起極大的恐慌，如最近大阪棉業交易所的停拍，未始不是此種法案的影響其實，最重大者，則為紡績聯合與大嚴百工商省的鬥爭，亦即八月下旬，紡績聯合會認為因原料輸入之停工，並因大藏省之範制外匯，影響購貨，要求設法通融，但政府方面認為本年所購之原料數量，足夠製造至明春一月，故不准所請，因此之战，一般無存棉毛的工廠，却相率停工，不但造出了無數的失業工人，並且動搖了日本的工業基礎。</p>
<p>與紡績界之情形相同，電力與製鐵等產業，也都受到了嚴重的統制，但此二業，因與軍需工業有密切之關係，故不若紡績業之痛苦良多。在電力方面最近之電力國策己見實現之可能‥按此運動，本發軔於廣田內閣遞用賴母木之企畫，欲將電氣事業，收歸國有，終因各會社之反對與廣田內閣之崩潰，宣告失敗‥但最近內戰事之影響，此種運動，又復推盛上，不過內容已稍改變，由政治經濟研究會與東京國策研究會（在野之最有權力團體，近衛內閣之閣員三人與書記長等，皆此會會員）所提出，巳可獲得遞信省核尤的模樣，其計劃方案，共計五條，現擇要摘譯如下：</p>
<p>㊀使現在之電氣會社，適應在國家經濟計劃。</p>
<p>㊁設立特殊會社，來開發未開發之電力。調和資本主義的長所與國家的計劃經濟之要求，成為新的國家企業姿態。</p>
<p>㊂電力配給與債務，由政府立在政府的見地，加以裁定推廣之。</p>
<p>㊃對於國策上特殊之生產事業，供給其廉價的電力。</p>
<p>㊄（省略）</p>
<p>此種法案，對於政府當然有利無害，但對於旣成電力會社，頗為不利，故將遭受各電力會社之反對，當為意中之事。不過在目前的時勢之下，軍部政府之勢力已支配一切，恐各會社亦無能為力也。</p>
<p>至於鋼鐵方面，因各國軍需之膨脹，已呈現鋼鐵飢饉之現象，尤以日本為甚。故自今年以來，日本因鋼鐵而惹起之種種困難與設施，不勝枚舉，如變輸入特免稅，鋼鐵會社之强制調查等等，皆可注目，尤其正月初旬發表之鋼鐵法更可注目，現因庸幅關係，俟有其他機會，當再申述之。</p>
<p>其他，在目前最顯活躍之産業界，當為新興財閥系，是些產業會社，皆以軍需品化學為中心，例如野口企業聯合體，它雖以製造淡幫肥料工業為本體，但在戰時，則能成為硝酸爆發工業的大本營，森企業聯合體，雖以製造電機工業為主體，但其所製之鋁，可作飛機和兵器之原料，日本曹達會社雖以製造曹達為本處，但在戰時，為製氯氣等瓦斯之大本營，其他如日本產業會社，雖非直接之軍需工業會社，但它實是軍需工業會社之供給會社，故在軍需景氣之影響下，亦有注目的發展；不過其他如運輸會社，製紙會社等，都因徵發或限制，皆漸萎縮，所以在目前的日本產業界裏，唯有軍需工業會社，站在唯我獨尊地位，其他產業會社已呈衰微；但實際上軍需工業雖見活躍，而其股票却仍與其他人造絲，精，紡織等一齊暴落，實為最可注目之事實，此事使日本政府，莫知所措，據“東朝一九月五日訊，東京股票交易所，據設立證券投資會社，以大量吸收而提高股票價值，是種不澈底之方法，絶不能挽救危機，故由此可知日本之一般産業，實已瀕於危機萬分矣！</p>

<p>然而我們要知道，我們不一定要上前綫去殺敵，才算抗戰。我們只須各人拿出自己的力量，簡單些說來，我們有錢的應當拿出錢來帮助國家，有能力的，更可以拿能力來供獻國家。</p>
<p>我們更要知道，我們的抗戰是長期的，所以我們的救國工作也是繼續不斷的。我們每人應當負責把家裏的人訓練起來，趕些救國工作，年老的太太們，可以呌他帮助做前方戰士的棉背心，年青的可以參加各種救亡團體，在後方服務，如小弟弟，妹妹們，你可以敎他們三四隻救亡的歌曲。再有最重要的一點，就是我們每天應當把報紙上的戰事消息，很詳細的分析講解給全家的人們聽。這一些重要而易做的工作，要大家負責推動牠，想各位一定不會拒絕的吧。</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting on the Banks of the Suzhou Creek, Two Enemy Attempts to Cross Were Repelled</h3>
<p>A Small Number of Remaining Enemy Troops in Zhoujiaqiao Are Being Cleared Out by Us. Enemy Forces Fiercely Attacking Jiangqiao and Xiaonanxiang Have All Been Driven Back. Our Air Force Bombed Enemy Positions in Zhabei Last Night.</p>
<p>The enemy army is attempting to cross the Suzhou Creek, and is now actively beginning again. Along both banks of the Suzhou Creek, from Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing, and from Beixinjing to Shenj浜, the fighting was unusually fierce throughout yesterday, with artillery fire ceaseless all day. The western district of the concession also heard the booming sounds clearly. The afternoon was especially intense. Stray bullets were numerous in the Zhaofeng Park and Caojiadu areas of western Shanghai. Three more British soldiers on guard duty were injured by enemy artillery shells. From Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing, the enemy army repeatedly used artillery fire for cover, and also released smoke bombs, in an attempt to cross the river and attack southward. Yesterday at dawn, a small number of enemy soldiers, under the cover of smoke bombs, crossed the river at the northern end of Luobiegen Road in Beixinjing, numbering approximately eighty. Our army calmly responded, and after the smoke cleared, took advantage of their unstable footing and launched a fierce attack. Approximately fifty enemy soldiers who crossed the river were annihilated, and the rest fell into the water and fled. In the afternoon, the enemy army made a second attempt to cross, releasing smoke at the northern end of Huobilan Road in Zhoujiaqiao, and concentrating artillery fire for cover, forcibly building pontoon bridges. One enemy team was also able to cross the river. Our army launched a sudden attack, and fierce fighting ensued in the area along the creek. Under our army's fierce assault, by midnight last night, only a very small number of remaining enemy troops remained, and they are being cleared out, which should be fully resolved. On the central front of the entire line, fighting was also ceaseless throughout yesterday. Large groups of enemy troops fiercely attacked our army's positions on the line from Jiangqiao Town to Xiaonanxiang, with intense artillery and infantry battles. The enemy was extremely eager to infiltrate Xiaonanxiang, hoping to shake our army's left and right flank positions. Our army bravely fought back, and the positions remained firmly in place. Our army's left flank, north of Xiaonanxiang, from Guangfu to Liuhe, was relatively quiet. The enemy seemed to have taken no action in that area. The loyal and brave soldiers of our army who withdrew from Zhabei yesterday, after retreating to a safe area, have now moved to another location to rest.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Entire Line North and South of Xiaonanxiang, Our Army Annihilated Over Six Hundred Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>Enemy Attack on Taiping'an Has Been Repelled. Our Army Firmly Defends Its Positions, Remaining Steadfast. We Also Achieved Victory on the North Bank of Beixinjing.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 1:00 PM on the 31st that at around 4:30 AM this morning, the enemy charged from Zhenbei Road, past Lizhai, and pressed upon Huangjiazhai, our position. Our army's × Regiment bravely intercepted them, engaging in combat four or five times. Fighting continued until about 8:00 AM, when a temporary ceasefire was called.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:30 AM on the 1st that starting at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, fierce fighting erupted again on the entire line north and south of Xiaonanxiang, lasting for five hours. Our army launched a frontal assault, annihilating over six hundred enemy soldiers. At 2:00 PM, the enemy sent reinforcements to attack again, but they were also repelled by us.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent reported at 12:30 AM on the 1st that on the north bank of Beixinjing, our army had been confronting the enemy for four days, with twenty major and minor battles. Our army had achieved victory in all of them. At 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy again attacked us with a force of over four thousand men, supported by mechanized units. We immediately intercepted them, dividing the enemy into several sections and attacking each one fiercely. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the enemy army retreated in fear.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the enemy is actively attacking our Xiaonanxiang to Jiangqiao line of defense. Starting early yesterday morning, they used the combined firepower of aircraft and artillery to bombard us. Around noon, the artillery fire subsided slightly, and the enemy launched a full-scale assault on our entire line, but they were all repelled by us. The two strongholds of Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town have always been firmly defended by our army, and there has been absolutely no change in the entire line of defense. In the evening, fierce artillery fire broke out again, but the enemy infantry did not attack again.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 10:00 PM on the 31st that the enemy was still fiercely attacking the Xiaonanxiang to Jiangqiao section. This afternoon, under the cover of artillery and aircraft, the enemy attacked Taiping'an, north of Jiangqiao. Our army bravely charged through the artillery fire and launched an assault. Fighting continued fiercely into the night, and our army's position remained steadfast.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Enemy Army Made Several Attempts to Cross the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>At Beixinjing and Zhoujiaqiao, They Failed After Being Fiercely Attacked by Our Army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that for several days, the enemy army has been using artillery to bombard our positions on the south bank from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, and multiple aircraft have been wantonly bombing various villages and towns along the creek. Their infantry has attempted to cross the river several times, but all have been repelled by our army. Yesterday morning, taking advantage of the heavy rain and fog, and releasing smoke for cover, they again attempted to cross. However, after about eighty people had crossed, our army immediately launched a head-on assault, annihilating the majority of them, and the remnants fled in disarray. In the afternoon, a second attempt to cross failed. Subsequently, both sides engaged in artillery fire, which continued into the night. The following is a report on the battle situation at 10:07 PM last night from our agency's correspondent with the army.</p>
<h3>General Situation on Both Banks</h3>
<p>The area where the enemy and we are confronting each other on both banks of the Suzhou Creek extends from the west of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shenj浜, with a length of approximately seven kilometers. Among them, the section from the railway to Zhoujiaqiao is approximately one kilometer, with two bridges in between, but both have been destroyed by our army. The section from Zhoujiaqiao to Beixinjing is approximately two and a half kilometers long, with a straight river course and many factories and villages on both banks, which can be used as strongholds. The section from Beixinjing to Shenj浜 is approximately three and a half kilometers long, with a winding river course and many ports and streams on the north bank. In terms of terrain, the river bank in the Beixinjing section is high in the north and low in the south, and the western section has many ports and streams, making it easier to cross. The enemy previously crossed stealthily, entering the Suzhou Creek from Xitou'an via the Panjia Port with small boats. Therefore, our army has been particularly vigilant at these two locations and the mouths of the ports and streams.</p>
<h3>The Initial Crossing Was Annihilated by Us</h3>
<p>At dawn yesterday morning, it was rainy and foggy, and enemy aircraft could not operate, so they released smoke. Approximately one hundred enemy soldiers crossed the Suzhou Creek from the opposite bank of Beixinjing. Although their actions were very stealthy, they were intercepted by our army before they could establish a firm foothold. The enemy resisted stubbornly with their backs to the river, and most of them were annihilated by us. The remnants fled in disarray. At 1:00 PM, it was discovered that approximately one enemy company was gathered at Majiazhai on the opposite bank, seemingly planning to cross the river again. Our army immediately bombarded them with mortars, hitting them multiple times, causing heavy casualties, and scattering them in disarray. They ultimately failed to proceed according to their original plan.</p>
<h3>Another Fierce Attack in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the enemy again released smoke in the Zhoujiaqiao area to cover their crossing, and forcibly built pontoon bridges. Our army launched a sudden attack, confronting them in the area along the creek, fighting fiercely until 7:00 PM. Only a dozen or so enemy soldiers remained, unable to retreat, and they were about to be completely eliminated. At around 3:00 PM, approximately forty or fifty enemy soldiers also crossed from Jiangjiazhai on the north bank to Liujiazhai on the south bank. Our army had made preparations in advance, and when they landed and had not yet dispersed, we immediately rushed out and surrounded them, annihilating them. At around 4:00 PM, the weather cleared, and enemy aircraft were deployed for reconnaissance for a long time, dropping several bombs. However, the artillery fire from both sides did not stop into the night.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting in the Western District</h3>
<p>The fighting was most intense at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A reporter ventured to observe the battle, and when passing through the western district of the concession, the sound of artillery was dense, and there were few pedestrians on the road, all with worried expressions. Occasionally, people could be seen carrying boxes and baskets, moving eastward to take refuge, but their number was not large. Upon reaching the destination, only a few hundred meters from the front line, there were no people to be seen, with only a few military police stationed there. The streets were quiet, and the sound of gunfire was particularly jarring. Ascending to a high vantage point, one could only see swirling smoke, connecting with the clouds, a vast expanse stretching for several miles. On both banks of the creek, there were three locations where fires were burning fiercely, with flames soaring upwards. The sound of machine guns was intermittent, originating from a distance, and was not as dense and tense as the sound of artillery. After about 4:00 PM, the rain stopped, and one enemy reconnaissance plane circled several times, but after being attacked by our army with anti-aircraft guns, it seemed to have been hit once. The plane suddenly moved northward, descending towards the enemy's position, but eventually struggled to rise again, but after that, it did not dare to fly low.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Bombed the Enemy Army Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Enemy Was Moving Very Busily, We Dropped Over Ten Bombs.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at around 6:00 PM last night, our air force ventured into Shanghai in the rain to scout enemy positions. Although the enemy army fired with anti-aircraft guns, it was not intense. When our plane passed through Zhabei, it saw the enemy army moving very busily and dropped over ten bombs. Several places caught fire, and the enemy army suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battles on the Huangpu River the Night Before Last and Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Four Battles, the Front Line Extended Over Twenty Li. The Enemy Flagship Izumo and Destroyers Were Damaged.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM the night before last, our garrison in Pudong received reports that the enemy was planning to use wooden rafts to send troops to attempt a landing. They immediately ordered a strict alert along the entire Pudong line. At the same time, the artillery positions first fired artillery shells at the enemy positions in eastern Shanghai. The enemy ships on the Huangpu River hurriedly fired back, and the battle was quite fierce. At around 8:00 PM, lookout soldiers of ours discovered dark shadows looming on the surface of the Huangpu River in the area of Taitong Wharf and New Mitsui Warehouse east of Lujiazui. There were about a dozen rows of wooden rafts, each carrying fifteen soldiers, with sandbags piled in front and machine guns mounted on top, being towed by several small boats, attempting to rush to the beaches at those locations. Our garrison at each port did not wait for them to approach, and used heavy machine guns to fire fiercely into the river. The other side also returned fire. At around 9:00 PM, the outposts reported that the enemy's wooden rafts had been repelled. Subsequently, the sound of gunfire from both sides diminished. At 9:45 PM, our artillery team again displayed its power, continuously firing shells into the enemy's positions. The ×× artillery team joined the battle, and the enemy warships, ranging from the Japanese Consulate to the fish market, over ten large and small warships, jointly bombarded us, extending the battle line for over twenty li. The fierce fighting stopped after 10:30 PM. Then, at around 11:00 PM, our side and the enemy side engaged in a third artillery battle, and Chinese and foreign people alike were awakened from their sleep at midnight by the booming sound of artillery. The target of our artillery focused on the vicinity of the enemy warships. The flagship Izumo was hit by our artillery fire. The enemy Destroyer No. 1, anchored at Buoy No. 37, was hit by our artillery fire, and many enemy soldiers were killed and wounded, demonstrating the state of panic of the enemy warships at that time. The fighting stopped at 2:00 AM yesterday morning. The enemy's positions in the Yangshupu and Zhabei areas were also severely damaged. At around 3:00 AM, the enemy warships fiercely bombarded Pudong again in an attempt to retaliate. Our side, having completed its mission, ignored it. After the enemy fired for half an hour, seeing that we were not moving, they stopped at around 3:30 AM. In the four artillery battles last night, the enemy warships fired a total of three or four hundred shells. Only a small number of civilian houses were destroyed, and there were over a dozen civilians, including Shen Wenkui, who were wounded by shrapnel. Zhang Fengzhi died without being rescued due to his intestines flowing out. As for our army's fortifications, they were not damaged at all.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Were Flying Everywhere in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Enemy Set Fire to Our Civilian Residences on Wuchang Road.</p>
<p>In the western Shanghai area yesterday, the fighting between the enemy and our army was fierce, and the sound of artillery fire did not cease all day. Stray bullets were flying everywhere in the Public Concession, and many people were injured. The details are recorded separately below: ⑴ At 10:00 AM, two British soldiers stationed on Bailey Gate Road were wounded in the thigh by enemy artillery shells. ⑵ At 1:50 PM, a Chinese police officer at the intersection of Changping Road and Jiaozhou Road was injured in the leg. ⑶ At 3:45 PM, a man was killed and a woman was injured by stray bullets on Yichang Road, Xiaoshadu Road. ⑷ Three men near Zhaofeng Park on Yuwei Road were also wounded by stray bullets. All of the above-mentioned people were sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, and fortunately, their injuries were minor and they should recover within a few days.</p>
<p>Also, the residence of Tang Zhongliang at No. 537 Wuchang Road, North Sichuan Road, was set on fire by the enemy yesterday, and the houses have been completely reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Notified Various Consulates to Bomb Nanshi</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Circle and Reconnoiter Nanshi, Caojiadu, and Longhua Yesterday.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that it has been learned that the enemy notified the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai yesterday morning, and relayed to various churches, schools, and organizations in the Nanshi area, ordering the foreign nationals residing there to relocate immediately, stating that they would bomb Nanshi yesterday afternoon. It is heard that the French side has sent the navy to Nanshi to protect the main water pipes of the waterworks.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, two enemy aircraft flew to the sky above Nanshi, circling back and forth and repeatedly reconnoitering for about half an hour, then flew eastward without dropping any bombs.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that although it was drizzling yesterday, enemy aircraft were still active, circling for a long time in a small area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, from Caojiadu to Longhua, often flying low to reconnoiter our army's machine gun positions. Our army continuously bombarded them with anti-aircraft machine guns, and the enemy aircraft fled in disarray.</p>

The municipal government purchased 2,100 pieces of Western-style pastries from the Xueyuan Food Company on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday to reward all the soldiers. Yao Shaohua and Yuan Zhizhuang, the people in charge of Xueyuan, admired the loyalty and righteousness of the brave soldiers and generously donated them. The municipal government has sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Our Loyal and Brave Four Hundred Isolated Soldiers Withdrawing from Zhabei</h3>
<p>Many Officers and Soldiers Recount the Process of Attack and Defense. The Da Mei Evening News Records the Truth of the Withdrawal.</p>
<p>The 377 brave soldiers of the Yang Battalion of the 88th Division's Xie Regiment (in addition, there are 26 wounded and several seriously wounded), who had been isolated in Zhabei for over 120 hours, were ordered to reluctantly withdraw from the Sihang Warehouse at 2:10 AM yesterday morning. They have now been transferred to a certain location for rest from a safe area. A reporter followed the Xie Regiment to a certain location and learned about the entire battalion's experience of bravely defending the Sihang Warehouse and fighting the enemy. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>They Left the Sihang at Two O'Clock Yesterday Morning.</p>
<p>Our army, isolated in Zhabei, received a secret order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and at 2:10 AM yesterday morning, they tidied up their machine guns, ammunition, and rations, and calmly left the Sihang Warehouse, which they had defended in isolation for four days. At the time of departure, the enemy's artillery fire was fierce. After four days of attack without any results, they used rapid-fire guns and other fierce weapons to concentrate their bombardment. However, our army had received the order to withdraw and remained calm, preparing in advance, personally escorted and protected by Regiment Adjutant Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu. At that time, Regiment Adjutant Xie also left over thirty machine gunners near the Sihang to return fire on the enemy's attacking forces, and they completely withdrew at around 3:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Wounded Soldiers Continued to Fight.</p>
<p>Because there were many troops, the retreat was not easy, and because the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, over thirty soldiers of the escorting troops were injured. Regiment Commander Xie was slightly wounded, and Battalion Commander Yang was injured in the ankle, but they still bravely fought the enemy, not retreating at all. At around 3:15 AM, the escorting troops all retreated to a safe area with Xie and Yang.</p>
<p>The Sacrificed Loyal Corpses Will Forever Exude Righteousness.</p>
<p>The enemy was completely unaware of our army's withdrawal and continued to attack with fierce artillery fire. Half an hour later, the enemy forces saw no movement and began to grope forward, sending large numbers of enemy troops. Angered by our army's repeated heavy blows over the past few days, they set fire, and by yesterday afternoon, the fire was still not extinguished. When they rushed out, one of our army's escorting troops was seriously wounded and sacrificed his life in front of the Sihang gate. At 12:00 PM yesterday, the entire battalion transferred to a certain location to rest. Within a short period of time, they will return to their unit and rush to the front line to continue serving the country. The reporter went to a certain location to inquire at 1:00 PM, and returned to the agency at 6:00 PM, and learned of our army's attack and defense situation since the 27th, as follows.</p>
<h3>Situation of Attack and Defense Since the 5th</h3>
<p>According to several officers of the said battalion who spoke to the reporter, our army's isolated defense of Zhabei was brief. Having received orders to withdraw, we were deeply grateful for the praise and encouragement from Chinese and foreign circles. We can only repay them by striving forward. Furthermore, compatriots from all quarters generously donated relief goods in countless amounts, for which we feel deeply indebted. We hope that in the future, all sectors will convert the money used to buy relief goods into national salvation bonds, which is no different from killing enemies on the front lines. Since the 27th morning, when our army remained to defend the Sihang Warehouse, the enemy has been attacking day and night. We have long held the belief that we must die, seeking nothing but to fulfill our final responsibility for the country and shed our last drop of blood. On the first morning, the enemy did not know that such a large force was stationed there, so they acted rashly. Several enemies carried enemy flags and climbed onto the roof of the Sihang Warehouse. Our army, with elite troops stationed at the entrance on the second floor, immediately shot and killed them. We then sent a small number of troops to the bottom floor to close the doors and windows tightly. Knowing we were prepared, the enemy poured kerosene and other substances in an attempt to set fire to it, but we had already built solid fortifications there, and the Sihang Warehouse was constructed with steel and concrete, so the enemy's plot failed. They then set up machine guns at the door. Our army had previously set up sentry sandbags there, so the enemy set up machine guns on the sandbags and fired at our roof. Our army swept them away with hand grenades and machine guns, killing three enemies instantly. Afterwards, we did not charge out, and the enemy's machine guns were left there. From then on, they did not dare to drag them away. On the night of the 27th, the enemy tried to sneak around, but we were seriously vigilant and nothing happened.</p>
<p>Building Solid Fortifications the Next Day</p>
<p>The next day, the enemy used flat-trajectory cannons to attack from the Shanghai Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Rui Da Lumber Company, attempting to destroy our fortifications. In addition to using the walls as natural defenses, we also built fortifications to avoid accidents, and set up protective cover on the roof. The enemy attacked many times without success, so they used airplanes to threaten us. Our army, under extremely solid fortifications, fired from high places, killing more than fifty enemies in two days. That evening, we received flags from the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scouts, and after receiving assistance from all sectors, all the comrades in the battalion felt even more excited and courageous. That night, we attacked the enemy with flat-trajectory cannons. At that time, the enemy was already in a helpless situation, so apart from firing machine guns fiercely, the enemy soldiers never dared to approach within fifty meters. On the morning of the 29th, the enemy again used flat-trajectory cannons to specifically target our third floor and the windows of each floor. Our army remained calm as usual, ignoring them. In the evening, our army again displayed its prowess, individually eliminating the enemy's probing troops. By this point, the enemy's deaths and injuries had exceeded sixty or seventy.</p>
<p>Once Charged to the Upper Warehouse</p>
<p>On the 30th, the enemy came up with a hundred plans. In addition to fiercely throwing flat-trajectory cannons, machine guns, and hand grenades, they also planned to attack with yachts on the Suzhou Creek. But we were determined not to be intimidated by this. Many of our comrades searched forward at night. That night, our army even charged to the Shanghai Bank warehouse. The enemy was terrified and did not know what to do. Our purpose was to deplete the enemy's strength, so after charging to the upper warehouse, we reorganized and retreated.</p>
<p>Ordered to Withdraw Late at Night and Early in the Morning</p>
<p>Until after 12:30 am, we suddenly received the withdrawal order from the highest leader, Chairman Chiang. We took obedience to orders as our supreme duty, and killing the enemy is not limited to a specific time or place. At this point, we painfully withdrew from Zhabei. As for Xie and Yang, due to their injuries and having been awake for five days and five nights, they declined all comfort. Although these brave men now have the opportunity to rest, they still hope to immediately return to the front lines to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Sihang Losses Exceed One Million</p>
<p>Around 7:00 am yesterday, the reporter went to the Jiangyuan Lane area of Xinzha Road and looked north. He saw the Sihang Warehouse still standing on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, but it was empty, increasing people's admiration for the brave men. The western wall of the warehouse was riddled with bullet holes, and several places were pierced through, showing the intensity of the enemy's shelling. The interior of the warehouse after the enemy set it on fire was ablaze, and the burning could still be seen through the bullet holes. The enemy flag had been raised on top of the warehouse, and passersby glanced at it with disapproval. The reporter then learned from related sources that the initial construction cost of the Sihang Warehouse was more than 200,000 yuan. However, after many years, the current estimated value is around 500,000 yuan. The goods piled up in the warehouse were mostly wheat, flour, soybeans, sesame, and the like deposited by grain merchants. The quantity was quite large, worth about one million yuan. However, the Sihang authorities and various grain merchants had all taken out insurance, so the total loss is estimated to be over 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reporter's Eyewitness Account</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News also published a detailed account written by its reporter, Mr. White, about the Japanese soldiers attacking the mainland warehouse, the Chinese soldiers resisting, and their withdrawal. It stated that after the Chinese soldiers had all withdrawn, we rushed to a certain place to inspect, and the last three trucks had just arrived. We then counted the number of people. There were 377 uninjured people and 26 injured people. There were still several seriously injured people who had been taken to the hospital. The Chinese soldiers withdrew in a blaze of glory, carrying their injured comrades and their bedding. They were all in high spirits, but several people looked worried because several of their comrades had died in the warehouse and their bodies had not been carried out. We gave a young officer a cigarette, and he thanked us humbly. A translator told us that they were stationed there under orders, and they withdrew also under orders. We asked if they were willing to stay longer, and one of them replied that soldiers mainly obey orders. If they were ordered to stay longer, all the comrades would be very willing and would not be afraid.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army attacked, several bullets hit the nearby water and fire company. The company had 100,000 cubic meters of gas stored, and if it exploded, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, the withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers was not only ordered by the highest authorities, but also earnestly requested by the concession authorities.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegram from the Korean Revolutionary Party</p>
<p>To Director Xie and Battalion Commander Yang of the Shenbao Hall's 88th Division, and all the loyal and brave soldiers: The Japanese bandits are rampant, invading China. Their atrocities and aggression are resented by both gods and men. Since the August 13th Incident, your country's troops have bravely resisted the war and repeatedly defeated stubborn enemies. Your divine might has spread, and the world is shocked. In this major battle, there was an occasional setback. Strategically, the battle lines were temporarily moved. However, your regiment's soldiers, with eight hundred isolated troops, defended a corner to the death, fighting on scorched earth for four days and nights, securing the final stronghold. They were willing to make heroic sacrifices to fulfill the duties of a soldier and protect the glory of their motherland. Now, they have obeyed the orders of the highest leader, enduring the pain of retreat, escaping the encirclement, and gaining safety to continue their efforts to repay the country. The righteous and great spirit of all the officers and soldiers is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, and rarely seen in the world. Our party comrades have heard and seen it with our own eyes, and we are moved to tears. We hereby send a telegram to express our respect. Shanghai Special Zone of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, October 31st.</p>
<p>Headquarters Commends Brave Soldier Director Xie</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the brave soldiers under Director Xie, who vowed to defend the last position in Zhabei to the death, have been bravely entrenched in the Sihang Warehouse since the 27th of last month, fighting fiercely under the encirclement of artillery fire for four days, earning worldwide admiration. Yesterday morning around 2:00 AM, they painfully withdrew under orders from the highest leader, and gathered in a safe area in the afternoon. All sectors admired the brave soldiers' loyalty and offered condolences. The General Headquarters, recognizing that the regiment's loyal and brave resistance had brought glory to the country, specially rewarded them with 3,000 yuan and promoted each of them by one rank to show commendation. Generous compensation will also be given to those who died and were injured. Before the regiment withdrew, the enemy claimed to launch a general attack, besieging them with fierce artillery fire for about five hours, but ultimately failed. About twenty minutes after the regiment safely withdrew, seeing no movement, the enemy began to probe and enter, searching each floor and then setting it on fire. After daybreak, the reporter went to inspect. Although the brave soldiers had lowered the flag and retreated, the building still stood majestically. The western wall was riddled with bullet holes and flames were bursting out. Recalling the heroic posture of our brave soldiers fighting the enemy on the roof the other day, I couldn't help but feel saddened.</p>
<p>Promoted One Rank and Awarded Medals</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 31st, when our army shifted its position, our 524th Regiment was ordered to provide cover in Zhabei. When the mission was accomplished, the enemy troops had tracked and pursued them. Regiment Commander Han Xianyuan led two battalions to resist step by step, and has not yet returned to the team. His regimental deputy, Xie Jinyuan, led officers and soldiers to retreat to the Sihang Warehouse, fighting the enemy for four days, repeatedly killing stubborn enemies, which aroused the admiration of Chinese and foreign people. On the morning of the 31st, they were ordered to withdraw. It was also heard that Chairman Chiang was deeply pleased with the officers and soldiers of the regiment deputy Xie Jinyuan and below, who carried out their duties and achieved their goals. He specially issued an order to all troops to promote each officer and soldier of the regiment by one rank, and requested the government to grant them honorary medals. As for the whereabouts of Protector Commander Han Xianyuan and other officers and soldiers and the deceased, they have been identified and will be submitted to the government separately for rewards and generous pensions to comfort the loyal souls and reward the meritorious.</p>

At 3:00 AM on the 28th, more than one thousand enemies launched a strong attack on a certain brigade of our central unit, using various weapons in combination, and some used tunnels to secretly approach. Our defending soldiers were thin, and reinforcements could not arrive in time, so the situation was very dangerous. After a brave counterattack, more than 200 enemies were killed, and more than ten rifles, as well as diaries, maps, and notebooks, were obtained. Our officers and soldiers suffered more than fifty casualties. Around 2:00 PM, the enemy launched a fierce attack on a certain division's two brigades. The momentum was very strong.

<p>[Taiyuan] According to the military news received by officials here today, the Japanese army's attempt to reopen the transportation line between Jinbei and its rear was defeated by the Chinese ××× army, and they溃逃 towards Datong and Zhangjiakou. It is said that the farmers in Hebei and Shanxi, inspired by the ××× army's fierce anti-Japanese propaganda, have spontaneously risen up to resist the Japanese army's invasion. Whether in steep mountains or in any location, they have attacked the Japanese army and destroyed its baggage trains and vehicles, which has been of great help to the ××× army's operations. Now, summarizing the war news from various sources in the past ten days, it is briefly described as follows: On October 19, when a large Japanese army attacked Guangling, the ××× army was driven to the nearby mountains. There were often five Japanese planes and twenty tanks attacking the Chinese army. After three days and three nights of fierce fighting, on October 24, the ×× army received a large number of reinforcements and defeated the Japanese army. The Japanese army then retreated to Guangling and tried to close the city gates tightly. However, the Chinese army guerrillas had ambushed in the city, causing fierce street fighting. By October 25, Guangling was completely occupied. At the same time, another detachment of the ××× army attacked Lingqiu to the south. The Mongolian puppet army defending the city resisted slightly and fled to Hunyuan. After the ×× army occupied Guangling, they left a part to guard it and sent a large unit to advance northeastward, crossing the Hebei-Chahar border and occupying Weixian County in Chahar. During the occupation of Weixian County, there was also fierce street fighting with the Japanese army and the Mongolian puppet army. The Japanese and puppet armies could not hold out and fled towards Zhangjiakou. A detachment of the Chinese army occupied Qingfengdian, south of Baoding, on the 26th. Now, the ×× army's positions have been greatly expanded. Places such as Weixian County in Chahar, Laiyuan in Hebei, and Lingshou, 20 miles northwest of Shijiazhuang, are all within its defensive range. The highway from Datong to Taiyuan, the highway from Guangling to Xiaguan Town, and the Yanmen Pass, the throat of Jinbei, are now all held in common. (30th National Telegram)</p>

More people moved out yesterday than the day before.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of Enemy Aircraft's Frenzied Bombing of Songjiang for Two Days</h3>
<p>Songjiang, 31st telegram. It has already been reported in this newspaper that this area was subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft on the 28th and 29th of this month, and the prosperous areas were completely destroyed. Now, in order to understand the actual situation of the bombing and all the details of the local area, our reporter made a special trip to the urban and rural areas for an on-the-spot investigation. It was found that the most prosperous West Gate Street in this area, except for the area east of Qianjing Bridge, west of Baojia Bridge, and the newly widened Changqiao Street, which was bombed into rubble on the 24th, almost all of the shops and residences from the West City Gate and outside the city to the Malu Bridge were destroyed. However, most of them were destroyed in the裹埭 (wrapped in soil), so the facades are still quite intact. It was found that the shops in this section are all relatively large firms in Songjiang, and the four banks of China, Farmers, Pawn Industry, and Xinhua, as well as the two money houses of Chengda and Yukang, and the two pawnshops of Quand and Henghe, were all established in this section, and the losses are particularly high. To the west of Malu Bridge, the Kang Yongchu family, the Jiang family of the 缸甏 (jars and vats) store, Du Jintai of Xiuye Bridge, and the vicinity of the 痧神廟 (Goddess of Measles Temple) were all bombed. The bombing of Du Jintai was the worst. To the west of the Pagoda Bridge, the</p>
<p>Mu Wei Girls' School, run by the American Christian Church in Jiuqu Lane, was hit by a shell and caught fire. The fire was fierce, but fortunately, the neighbors on all sides were not affected. At the same time, the Shangsong Bus Station south of the Magao Bridge and the West City Gate also caught fire. The fire at the West Gate was the most intense. At that time, there was a strong north wind, making it even more difficult to extinguish. Other places, such as Black Fish Lane, Mo Jia Lane, Yangjia Bridge, Miaoyan Temple, Shihui Bridge, Zhuhang Street, Gao Jia Lane, Houzhuhang Street, Zhugan Hui, Yangjia Lane, etc., were also bombed. The main hall of the Yue Temple, which had just been rebuilt with funds raised from the Taoist temples, was also completely destroyed. When the shells hit the West City Gate, dozens of pedestrians were hiding inside the city gate opening. Seven or eight people were killed and dozens injured by shrapnel. Heads were missing and feet broken, a truly tragic sight. Even more shells hit the city. From the West Gate to Yangjia Bridge, more than a dozen shells hit the upper and lower embankments. The destruction of the Dahua Printing Bureau was the worst. Further east, from the entrance of Socks Lane to the end of Center Lane,</p>
<h3>Tragic Scene of People's Homes Bombed in Songjiang</h3>
<p>— (War Shadow Team Photo)</p>
<p>All Houses are Completely Destroyed. Among them, the section from in front of the Court to the end of Center Lane, because it had been bombed once before, after being bombed again this time, the houses completely collapsed and became a rubble field. In the south of the County Government, the south of the Court, the south of the Inspection Yard, the Lu Jia Bridge in the South Inner City, Qiu Jia Wan (Zhengxin Middle School, run by the Catholic Church, was also destroyed), and other small streets, one or two shells fell. In short, 70% of the main streets and small alleys outside the west and inside the city were hit by shells and bombed. Everywhere you look, it is a scene of desolation. The essence of Songjiang has been damaged by 60% or 70%. The number of dead and injured is no less than 200 people. The Songjiang Red Cross will find ways to rescue and bury them. All the shops are now closed. Poor people even have money but nowhere to buy rice and are suffering from hunger. The inhumanity of the Japanese pirates is enough to arouse the outrage of the world. As for the local authorities, except for Commissioner Wang of the Special Office, who is still leading his subordinates to work as usual in the original place and is working hard, the rest have moved to other places. The doctors in the hospitals are also scattered and the hospital services have been suspended. Therefore, after this incident, the Red Cross Society alone maintained all rescue and burial work. However, because the hospitals have moved or closed, the rescue team</p>
<p>Risking Their Lives to Go to the Bombed Areas for Rescue, after escaping danger, they felt deeply troubled because there was nowhere to send the wounded for treatment. Fortunately, the Director of the Society, Mr. Zhou Xuewen, led his subordinates to work hard, and even in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances, he never turned back and completed his mission. At present, 70% or 80% of the people in Songjiang have fled to other places, and only a small number of poor people are left. As for the local newspapers, because the Jinwen and Dahua printing presses were completely bombed and the Chengzhang printing press was also damaged by the shock, they have all been shut down, which has affected the printing of the newspapers, so they have all temporarily suspended publication. (Another report) An enemy plane flew over Songjiang for reconnaissance at around 2:00 PM on the 30th, and after circling in the city for two weeks, it flew to the northwest and dropped two shells each in the center of the two towns of Chenfang Bridge and Maihua Bridge. It is reported that many houses were destroyed and the number of casualties is still being investigated.</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>— Yi</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Resilient Warfare</h3>
<p>The enemy has captured Dachang and Niangziguan, thinking that they can easily take Shanghai and Taiyuan. But our brave soldiers retreated to new defense lines, fighting with even greater spirit. They are determined to defend Shanghai and Taiyuan, not only not allowing the enemy to advance another step, but also taking advantage of any opportunity to attack the enemy's lines.</p>
<p>This spirit of resilient warfare is the most valuable and commendable. Its effects are already evident. In the Shanghai theater, in the past two months, the enemy did not expect our army to be so resilient in combat, and their offensive plans failed many times. In the end, they had to risk extremely heavy sacrifices and adopt a roundabout assault strategy. However, our defenders in Zhabei still withdrew as an entire division. The enemy only gained a scorched earth in Zhabei, which can by no means compensate for the cost of many bloody battles. In the Shanxi theater, the enemy broke through the Yanmen Pass, but suffered repeated defeats. Now, the main force of the enemy in the Xinkou area is trapped in a predicament of advancing or retreating. And the enemy forces advancing from eastern Shanxi are still facing enemies on all sides. In any case, up to now, the situation in both theaters is extremely optimistic. And the main factor that makes it optimistic is the resilient spirit shown by our troops.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, our final victory can only be achieved through a protracted war of resistance. I believe that the strategy adopted by our military authorities must also maintain the spirit of resilient warfare as the first priority.</p>

<h3>The United States Intensifies Its Rearmament Plan</h3>
<p>Orders 270 "Flying Fortresses," Plans to Build 1,800 Military Aircraft, Roosevelt Again Rejects Militarism</p>
<p>[Washington] The United States' rearmament plan has recently been intensified. The Navy Department announced today that the government's order for 270 "Flying Fortresses" has been put out to tender, with a total cost of over US$200 million. At the same time, a spokesman for the Army Department also announced a plan to build 1,800 new military aircraft, with a budget that is expected to be completed by the end of 1938. At that time, the number of military aircraft in the United States will double. The Treasury Department stated that this year's national defense expenditure has increased by 10% compared to last year, and slightly exceeds President Roosevelt's budget. Since July 1, the expenditure has been 303,497,264 yuan, compared to 20,704,258 yuan at the same time last year. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙New York Sea Defense Park. President Roosevelt today cited the peaceful relations between the North and South American countries as a model for the abolition of war throughout the world. The President told representatives of a women's organization that the peace in the Americas was created by treaties and arbitration. Other countries have also gradually realized that international disputes can be resolved without the use of force. Therefore, the influence of the Americas on the world is very far-reaching. At present, some countries still have hostile attitudes towards each other, and the problem lies in their inability to abide by treaties like the American countries. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Prospects of the Brussels Conference</h3>
<p>Expresses Satisfaction with U.S. Active Action, German Foreign Minister States Reasons for Not Attending</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, The Times and The Observer commented on it separately, with different views. The Times expressed satisfaction that the United States did not participate in the conference as an observer, but actively participated as a member. It also stated that after the establishment of peace in the Far East, European countries, which love peace, can devote their full attention to the European situation, and European peace can be encouraged. The reason why other countries try to delay or hinder peace in the Far East also lies in this. The Observer said that "European countries' talk of peace plans for the Far East situation is laughable. As the saying goes, good deeds should start with enjoying oneself. Peace is the same as good deeds. If European peace is not achieved through the efforts of European countries, it will be difficult to contribute to peace in the Far East. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Munich. German Foreign Minister Neurath delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the German Academy of Law today, elaborating on Germany's attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. First, he analyzed the views of group politics, and then stated that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was a practical opportunity for Councillor to resolve international disputes. Germany did not accept the invitation because the conference was convened using the provisions of the 1922 Nine-Power Treaty. Since Germany is not a signatory country, it cannot be expected to participate. However, the reply clearly stated that when the time is ripe and the main conditions are met, Germany is willing to participate in the cooperation to mediate the Sino-Japanese conflict at any time. Regarding the prospects of this meeting, Neurath declared that when the League of Nations convened this meeting, the elements of group politics it contained were very few, and its progress may not be very smooth. I believe that no matter what attitude each country takes towards the Sino-Japanese conflict, it is difficult to achieve the purpose of mediation if they are in the position of moral judges when mediating the war.

<h3>Belgian New Cabinet Difficult to Produce</h3>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Spaak Expected to Succeed as Prime Minister</p>
<p>⊙Brussels. Since the resignation of former Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland, no new government has been formed. Former Socialist Finance Minister De Man was commissioned to form a cabinet on Friday, but later gave up because the Liberal Party refused to cooperate. Socialist stalwart Vandeville also refused to form a cabinet before. However, the whole country hopes that a new government can be formed before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (30th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels. After the failure of former Finance Minister De Man to form a cabinet, King Leopold III appointed right-wing Senator Obanpe to form a cabinet, but Obanpe has declined. It is now generally believed that the King will ask former Foreign Minister Spaak, a member of the Socialist Party, to form a new cabinet. It is likely that Spaak will accept and the new cabinet is expected to be formed, because the Liberal Party has a better impression of Spaak than De Man. If Spaak refuses to form a cabinet, someone from outside the parliament will be asked to form a cabinet. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan-Italy Negotiations</h3>
<p>Joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, Italy Has Not Yet Expressed Its Position</p>
<p>[Rome]</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's joining the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, observers generally believe that, as of now, there has been no official expression that would lead one to believe that it is immediately possible. As for those responsible in Japan and Italy, they have consistently refused to release any information. Furthermore, before Japan's former ambassador to Italy, Sugimura Yotaro, was transferred to be the ambassador to France, he negotiated and concluded a commercial treaty between Italy and Japan with the Italian government. However, this commercial treaty has not yet been signed. Therefore, some people believe that the reason for the delay in signing the commercial treaty may be due to the fact that Rome and Tokyo are currently negotiating a political treaty, so the commercial treaty will be concluded at the same time as the political treaty is established. However, whether Italy will only participate in the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, or conclude a separate agreement with Japan, is unknown to political figures. According to reports, when the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan was established last year, Italy was unwilling to join the agreement. Later, Italy changed its attitude and expressed its willingness to participate in the agreement at the beginning of this year. However, Japan suddenly expressed its unwillingness again. However, recently, as the situation in the Far East has evolved, the relationship between Japan and Italy has become increasingly close, so even if a political agreement is established between the two countries, it will not add anything to the actual relationship between the two countries. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Asahi Shimbun has learned that Italy will join the anti-communist agreement between Japan and Germany. A complete agreement has now been reached between Japan, Germany, and Italy. Italy has abandoned its proposal to establish a separate bilateral agreement. The draft of the three-nation anti-communist agreement will be discussed at the next meeting of the Privy Council. This three-nation agreement can be formally announced in early November. At that time, the agreement will be signed in Rome by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop, and Japanese Minister to Switzerland Horita Masaaki.

<h3>Italy Suddenly Recalls Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>European Speculation Uneasy</p>
<p>[Paris] Italian Ambassador to France Cerruti formally notified the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he had received instructions from his government to grant him "leave" to return home. Cerruti is scheduled to depart tomorrow afternoon and return to Rome. According to Italian sources here, the ambassador's leave is quite lengthy. The French generally believe that this move by the Italian government is to put its diplomatic representatives in France on an equal footing with the French diplomatic representatives in Italy, because after the retirement of former French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun a year ago, the government appointed Saint-Quentin, Director of the African Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to succeed him, and sought the consent of the Italian government. Although Italy agreed, it requested that the salutation on the new ambassador's credentials must use the words "His Majesty the King of Italy, Emperor of Abyssinia." France, in its capacity as a member of the League of Nations, found it difficult to accept this, so the Chargé d'affaires of the Embassy in Italy, Bérongtair, has been acting as the Chargé d'affaires to this day. (30th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The sudden recall of the Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, has caused speculation in various European countries, and Paris is particularly surprised. According to the official explanation in Paris, this move by Italy is due to the lack of a French ambassador in Rome. Since the retirement of the French Ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, last year, there has been no successor, and if France has to send an ambassador to Italy, it must recognize Italy as the Emperor of Abyssinia. There is also a saying that the speeches made by important figures at the rally of the Radical Socialist Party in Le Rée on Friday have greatly angered Mussolini, but this theory cannot be established now, because the speeches had not yet been conveyed to Rome when the Italian ambassador was recalled. At the Radical Socialist Party congress, former Prime Minister Herriot hinted at ominous developments in Africa and asked, "Who knows that the flag hanging in Palma is the Spanish flag." At the same time, Foreign Minister Terbos compared the incidents in Manchuria and Abyssinia, saying that the violation of treaties has emboldened imperialism and made the threatened countries more uneasy. Unofficially in Rome, it is believed that the recall of the ambassador is due to the gradual deterioration of friendship between the two countries over the past year, and it is felt that the current state of bad feelings between France and Italy has reached the extreme after the visit of French Foreign Minister Laval to Italy in 1935. However, officially, it is only said that Cerruti's return home is because Cerruti wants to spend his Christmas holidays in Rome. Furthermore, there are rumors that there will be a large-scale change of Italian diplomats, and Cerruti is intended to be given other appointments, while the Embassy in France will be headed by the Chargé d'affaires.

<h3>Bulgarian King and Queen Visit France and England</h3>
<p>Politically Significant</p>
<p>[London] Bulgarian King Boris and Queen arrived in Paris this morning, and are scheduled to arrive in England for a visit this evening. King Boris's trip has political significance, and he will hold talks with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden to explain Bulgaria's foreign policy. It is heard that this policy is purely based on historical viewpoints and geographical relations. Although it does not participate in the Balkan Accord group, it will also maintain a detached position towards the political axis formed by Italy and Germany. According to reports, the United Kingdom has latent influence on the Balkan countries in spirit, which can prevent these countries from being attracted by the Soviet Union or being brought under the control of the political axis of Italy and Germany. This can be seen from King Boris's visit to the United Kingdom. (31st Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Municipal Organizations' Meeting Issues Declaration and Telegram on Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Expressing Solemn Positions Based on the Spirit of the Treaty</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association, in view of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be held in Brussels on the third of this month, regarding whether this conference will have satisfactory results, is a major turning point for world peace and the blessings and woes of humanity. Therefore, the Association convened a joint meeting of over a hundred representatives from the city's industry, commerce, women, culture, and various national salvation organizations the day before yesterday to conduct a comprehensive review of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Several important proposals were decided on the spot and have been reported in various newspapers. The association specifically issued a declaration yesterday, expressing solemn positions based on the spirit of the treaty, and sent telegrams to the whole country to rise up and strive together. It also appointed nine representatives to deliver letters to the consulates of various countries in the city, requesting each to telegraph its government to uphold the treaty's consistent position. The declaration and telegram, etc., are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Declaration: We believe that only by guaranteeing international peace can human well-being be developed, and only by respecting international treaties can world peace be guaranteed. Therefore, any country that violates treaties and arbitrarily commits aggression is not only a major disaster in one area but also an enemy of humanity. Because peace is complete and indivisible, in the current stage of intricate and closely related international political economy, even a single strand can affect the whole body, and the disaster of a prairie fire, if not extinguished early, will not only cause China to suffer miserably, but also the friendly nations directly or indirectly related to the Pacific will inevitably suffer unpredictable and terrible consequences. Since the "September 18th" Northeast Incident, the enemy has been barbaric and unscrupulous, advancing step by step. The bullying and oppression we have suffered from Japanese imperialism in recent years are all performances of their consistent continental monopolization policy. Their purpose is not only to damage China's sovereignty and plunder China's territory, but also to destroy the entire China, then dominate East Asia, and threaten Europe and the United States. At that time, in order to trust and abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, we temporarily tolerated and did not argue, expecting righteous condemnation and effective sanctions. At the same time, we hoped that in the difficult and arduous situation, we would unify the interior, develop resources, and devote ourselves to economic and cultural construction, sharing the interests of all mankind, as a pillar of world peace. But the facts tell us that these expectations have gradually faded due to the enemy's continuous attacks and various forms of indulgence and perfunctory treatment. The dignity of the treaty has been submerged by the enemy's artillery fire, and international peace has been trampled by the enemy's muddy feet. The enemy's provocations from the Lugou Bridge to the Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai have created a situation in which the Chinese nation is fighting a full-scale war of resistance. No one can imagine its future, but we will never waver or succumb to any situation. Although we are a nation that loves peace and values ​​trustworthiness, we cannot but fight for survival, and we cannot but fight to protect the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which is to say that we cannot but fight for international peace and human justice. Now the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, convened by the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, will open in Brussels on November 3, in order to resolve the disputes between the two countries based on the principles of the treaty and to seek the re-establishment of world peace. We express our infinite gratitude and joy for the good intentions and efforts of the friendly nations. Although some people doubt its future, we cannot but recognize its importance and pay close attention to it. Since this conference is based on the Nine-Power Treaty, it should undoubtedly fulfill the obligations of the treaty without compromise and promote the spirit of the treaty. The first principle of the treaty is to "respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China." The second is to "give China the fullest and most unfettered opportunity to develop and maintain a strong and consolidated government." Japan is one of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. From the moral and legal point of view, it should abide by this principle unswervingly. Unfortunately, the enemy's acts of aggression and violence over the past few years have completely torn up the treaty in fact. Therefore, we have the following requirements for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference: First, the League of Nations has resolved to prove that Japan has destroyed the treaty and invaded China. Then this conference should take the same action as the League of Nations and declare Japan as a country that violates the treaty and behaves aggressively. Second, according to the first principle of the treaty, Japan should be ordered to fulfill the obligations stipulated by the treaty, that is, to immediately withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China back to Japan, and to abolish all false organizations that undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity. Third, any international treaty or agreement that violates the principles of the treaty should be declared invalid. Fourth, if the violating country does not fulfill all the resolutions to uphold the treaty, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, promptly impose collective and effective sanctions, that is, sever diplomatic, commercial, and financial relations with Japan. If it is still ineffective, then use force to stop Japan's acts of aggression. Fifth, the participating countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the member states of the League of Nations should give China substantial assistance, such as supplying military supplies and raw materials, and not prohibit their own people from participating in the Chinese army service and similar acts. Sixth, this conference should expand the original treaty, add mutual assistance clauses and sanction clauses, and stipulate the establishment of a permanent supervision and enforcement mechanism, so as to expand it into a general collective security treaty for the Pacific. The signatory countries should include all countries in East Asia or the Pacific that have vested interests. The above six points are our firm demands, and at the same time, they are the only way to maintain international peace. If it is just passive dredging and weak condemnation, the outcome of the conference will be tantamount to destroying its own position and fueling the enemy's ferocity. Although we love peace very much, we dare not agree with it. It must be known that China is a country that has been invaded, and most of its territory has been plundered by the enemy. National sovereignty and national survival are being persecuted in an unprecedented way. The question now is not how to stop the war, but what reasonable and thorough methods can be used to eradicate the war in the Far East. China is forced to fight, and is struggling painfully under the sword and chain. This war of self-defense will never end until sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity, and national survival are effectively guaranteed. In other words, our only purpose is to practice the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, to restore the original state of sovereignty, independence, territorial and administrative integrity, and to establish a treaty and mechanism for collective security in the Pacific. What is needed is permanent peace, not temporary peace, and glorious peace, not humiliating peace. The countries that convened and participated in this conference have always had sincere friendship with China, and they must also feel the threat of Japanese aggression deeply. If the treaty can be overthrown arbitrarily and justice can be discarded arbitrarily, then the Japanese ferocity will destroy the entire world, and those who suffer from it will not be limited to China. This is what we hope that friendly nations will be wary of in advance and prevent. Finally, we hope that our government and all compatriots will promote the success of the conference in a revolutionary diplomatic manner and give a serious blow to the invaders who violate the treaty.</p>
<p>Telegram: To all national agencies, organizations, newspapers, schools, and all overseas embassies and consulates, and all overseas Chinese, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, which was passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, is about to open in Brussels. No one can predict the outcome at this time, but the nature of the conference is convened because Japan has destroyed the treaty, so all claims and resolutions should be based on the principle of "respecting China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity" in the treaty, and strive to implement it actively in order to maintain the dignity of the treaty and to give weight to international credibility. Since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, Japanese imperialists have attacked Suiyuan and Chahar, ravaged eastern Hebei, used traitors and bandits, engaged in insidious plots of encroachment, and arbitrarily trafficked drugs and smuggled goods, destroying our people's lives, and recently intensified their efforts to forcibly seize Hebei by force, attacking Shanghai. Planes and artillery bombarded indiscriminately, cultural institutions have been destroyed, and women and children seeking refuge have been killed and bled. Their intention is not only to destroy China, but to dominate Asia, and covet Europe and the United States. If this continues to be rampant, it will inevitably lead to a world war and leave endless disasters for mankind. Our purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China. At this time of peace, despair, and national crisis, there is no way to protect survival without resistance, and there is no way to win a glorious victory without resisting to the end. The Nine-Power Treaty was originally established to promote international justice and protect peace in the Far East. All signatory countries have the obligation to fulfill it. Now Japanese imperialists, regardless of everything, take the lead in destroying it. In their minds, they have long despised justice and are willing to be the leader of bandits and international robbers. It is impossible to talk about reconciliation, and it is impossible for reconciliation to be effective. Since the League of Nations has proved that Japan has destroyed the treaty and invaded China, this conference should take the same action as the League of Nations and declare Japan as an aggressor and a violator of the treaty, ordering Japan to abide by all the provisions of the treaty, and withdrawing all naval, land, and air forces in China back to Japan within a time limit, and abolishing all false organizations that undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity. Any treaty or agreement that violates the spirit of the treaty should be declared invalid. If Japan still ignores this resolution and goes its own way, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, sever diplomatic, commercial, and financial relations with Japan. If it is still ineffective, then swords and shoes should be used immediately to implement military sanctions, and provide China with material, financial, and human assistance. In addition, we believe that in this conference, the Nine-Power Treaty should be supplemented, adding mutual assistance and sanction clauses, and stipulating the establishment of a permanent supervisory and enforcement agency, so as to be passed down as a collective security treaty and mechanism for the Pacific. All the above are our necessary claims, and they are a permanent guarantee for peace in the Far East. It must be known that this war is China's last war. Life and death are of great importance. There is a self-confidence in winning victory, and there is a spirit of no compromise. There is a determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and the nation has hope of revival. All measures taken to reconcile and compromise, hoping to seek temporary peace and self-interest, and to damage China's sovereignty, territory, and administrative integrity, we, for the sake of the future of the nation, have no choice but to refuse resolutely without being intimidated. The opportunity is urgent. We hereby appeal to our elders, brothers, sisters, and sisters to rise up together, use all means to run around and shout to show the true intentions of the people, and to promote the vigilance of friendly nations. The telegraph is endless. Shanghai Municipal Joint Conference of Various Groups bows to the world.</p>
<p>Visit: The meeting had previously decided to send representatives to visit the consuls of various countries in the city to deliver letters, requesting them to telegraph their respective governments to uphold the treaty and unanimously advocate sanctions against Japan. The delegation has appointed Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Tong Xingzi, Liu Zhanen, Xu Xinliu, Yan Fuqing, and Zhu Shaoping as nine representatives, and scheduled to visit the consuls of various countries in Shanghai today and deliver letters, requesting them to convey the opinions of the citizens of this city on the Nine-Power Treaty and the wishes of the governments of friendly nations.</p>
<h3>Young Air Force Reconnaissance Officer Yun Yi'an Sacrifices for the Country</h3>
<p>Engaged in a fierce battle with a large enemy aircraft formation on the Tongpu Northern Line in Shanxi Province, wounded, broke through and crash-landed in Huoxian County after exhausting all strength</p>
<p>Yun Yi'an, a young air force reconnaissance officer, was ordered to join the battle in Shanxi Province and died for his country on October 15. At that time, due to brief telegrams and delayed mail, there was no way to know the details. Yesterday, his brother Yun Yiduo obtained a letter from his family from his hometown, describing the circumstances of his martyrdom. It is specially recorded as follows: Martyr Yun Yi'an was from Wujin, Jiangsu. In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the Central Aviation School and graduated in the summer of the 24th year. He served in the Nanjing Aviation Committee and the Hangzhou alma mater. Later, he entered the advanced reconnaissance class of the Nanjing Aviation Committee for further study. Last year, he was selected to enter the Army-Air Force Liaison Reconnaissance Class of the Central Army Officer Training Class. He graduated in July this year and was assigned to the Air Force No. ×× Team. When the "August 13" Shanghai battle broke out, he was transferred to Nanjing from ×× to participate in the Eastern Battlefield campaign. In early September, he was transferred from Nanjing to ××, and fought on the Pinghan Line and Jin Sui. On October 15, while conducting reconnaissance on the Tongpu Northern Line, he encountered a large enemy aircraft formation and created an enemy defense. He was wounded and flew south, and crash-landed in Huoxian County after exhausting all strength. His remains were coffined and buried by the local authorities and have been transported to Luoyang. The martyr was only twenty-three years old. He was silent and liked to study tirelessly. He always had a book in his hand and had absolutely no juvenile habits. Before entering the officer training class and after graduating from the training class, his family urged him to get married twice, but the martyr refused with "How can I have a home before the Huns are destroyed?" The villagers and relatives all expected him to become a great talent, but his great ambitions have not been fulfilled and he has died for the country, and they all feel regret. His father, Mr. Xuan Shu, is over sixty years old. Although he comforted himself and others with "It is the glory of the family to have a son like this" when he heard the bad news, he could not help but shed tears and his heart was overwhelmed with grief. It is now decided by the family to establish a school in Changcheng with the martyr's pension, etc., as a permanent memorial.</p>

<h3>Those Who Are Enthusiastic About Purchasing Public Bonds Are Prepared to Request Rewards</h3>
<p>Detailed Reports from Individuals and Organizations, Compiling Calculations, Creating Registers, and Requesting Rewards</p>
<p>The General Association of the National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Committee issued Announcement No. 11 yesterday, stating: "The regulations and grading methods for rewarding the purchase of national salvation public bonds have been promulgated by order of the National Government and distributed by this association for inspection. This association should forward those compatriots at home and abroad who enthusiastically contribute and purchase bonds in accordance with the reward regulations and methods to the National Government for awards in accordance with the regulations in order to show encouragement and to promote the code of honor. However, although this association has ledgers that can be consulted for the bond funds that have already been purchased, it is difficult to compile statistics on the rewards that purchasers should receive because purchasers may pay in installments, or may be in professional teams, or may purchase more than once, or may be contracted in more than one place, resulting in separate collections and separate accounts. For this reason, a public announcement is made that all people from all walks of life, whether individuals or organizations, who have installment payments or payments made in different places, and who consider that the total amount of purchases meets the reward regulations and methods, should quickly submit the name, place of origin, address, payment date, receiving agency, and the number of the public bond receipt they hold, and report it to this association for compilation, calculation, creation of registers, and request for rewards. It is hoped that you will do so. This is a special announcement."</p>
<p>Special Group: The First Special Grade Group of the Citizens' Fundraising Team for National Salvation Public Bonds has continued to receive reports from various teams on the results of their fundraising as follows: First Team, 875 yuan; Fourth Team, 1002 yuan and 48 cents; Eighth Team, 1300 yuan; Fourteenth Team, 270 yuan; Twenty-first Team, 763 yuan and 20 cents; Sixth Special Team, 17,940 yuan. The group is urging the remaining unpaid teams separately in order to compile them and submit them to the general team for the fourth time.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine Community: Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, members of the traditional Chinese medicine community have been extremely enthusiastic about the patriotic movement. They have organized rescue teams to go to the front lines. Captain Xu led the team members to participate in the work of national salvation and the results are remarkable. The China Traditional Chinese Medicine Association purchased 4,000 yuan of national salvation public bonds from its public reserve fund, and the Shanghai Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Association purchased 1,000 yuan from its construction fund. Other doctors have purchased a total of more than 30,000 yuan. A local association recently launched a campaign to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers in the north, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association recognized a loss of 2,000 yuan, which was sent to the local association for joint delivery yesterday.</p>
<p>YMCA: The Shanghai YMCA previously launched a campaign to raise national salvation public bonds, and raised 100,000 yuan in less than two weeks, reaching its expected goal. Now the association has launched a campaign to raise reserve funds for national salvation public bonds, and has organized 100 fundraising teams, which are scheduled to start today and end at the end of this month. The estimated goal is 10,000 households. The fundraising methods are as follows: (A) Each household deposits at least one yuan to open a savings book. (B) Thereafter, deposits can be made continuously, regardless of the amount, until five yuan is deposited, and then national salvation public bonds can be exchanged. (C) Anyone who deposits five yuan or more at a time is also counted as one household and can receive a national salvation public bond receipt and a savings book. (D) The money can be sent directly by the fundraiser or the depositor to the Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or the Central Trust Bureau on Albert Road for payment and receipt of the savings book. (E) After the depositor receives the savings book, the fundraiser must still encourage continued deposits as much as possible to fulfill the original intention of the public bond savings. (F) If the fundraiser has money in hand, please pay it to the Trust Bureau immediately to clear the procedures. The YMCA also held a tea party at 2:00 pm yesterday to invite the captains to report everything, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Christians: Since the Shanghai Christian Association launched a campaign to raise national salvation public bonds, it has been progressing smoothly. Various churches in the city have established fundraising teams to actively promote it. According to news from Moore Church on Sanma Road, as of yesterday, the church had more than 4,270 yuan in subscriptions. The results of other churches are also considerable and are still actively raising funds.</p>
<h3>Memorial of the Death of Mr. Huang Keqiang</h3>
<p>Various Groups on Two Roads Hold Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>The Two Roads Party Department, the Two Roads Anti-Enemy Support Association, and the Two Roads Labor Union and other organizations held a memorial service for the death of Mr. Huang Keqiang at 10:00 am on the 31st of this month in the temporary auditorium of the Party Department. More than 60 representatives participated. Chairman Li Dasan, member of the Standing Committee, presided over the ceremony. After performing the ceremony as usual, the chairman gave a report, which roughly stated that Mr. Keqiang followed the Premier and dedicated himself to the revolution. Not only was his history long, but his achievements were also great. He had always studied military and political affairs and had his own ideas. He participated in various uprisings and was able to defeat the majority of the Manchu Qing forces with a small number of revolutionary forces. Now, at the time of the full-scale war of resistance, we must use Mr. Keqiang's spirit of fearlessness of death and revolutionary tactics to deal with the Japanese invaders, so that we can achieve the final victory and complete Mr. Keqiang's legacy. Then, Standing Committee Member Song Chuanji gave a speech (omitted). The meeting ended at 11:00 am.</p>
<h3>Anti-Enemy Association Sets Deadline for Exchanging Official Receipts</h3>
<p>At 133 Edward Road, Failure to Exchange After Deadline Will Disqualify Receipt of Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Anti-Enemy Support Association issued an announcement yesterday regarding the exchange of official receipts for national salvation donations: "The national salvation donations raised by this association were entrusted to various banks and newspapers in the city for collection. Initially, due to the inability to print official receipts in time for application, some donations were only given temporary receipts by the Bank of China and newspapers. It has been announced in newspapers and urged to exchange the receipts. Now that the fundraising has long been terminated and is in the process of closing, donors holding temporary receipts are urgently needed to exchange for official receipts, so that they can rely on these official receipts to exchange for national salvation public bonds from the National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Association. The procedure for exchanging official receipts is entrusted to Xu Yongzuo Accounting Firm to handle. All donors who have previously received receipts that only have the name and seal of the bank and newspaper but do not have the name and seal of this association are temporary receipts. It is hoped that they will exchange for official receipts from Xu Accounting Firm at 123 Edward Road, Shanghai, during normal office hours from now until the end of November this year. Failure to exchange after the deadline will not be allowed, and temporary receipts will not be allowed to exchange for national salvation public bonds.

<h3>The Relief Process for Refugees in Western Shanghai</h3>

<h3>The Tragic State of the Enemy Setting Fire to Burn Houses in Zhabei</h3>
<p>— (Shot by the War Film Group)</p>
<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>From "Sad Literature" to Popular Education</h3>
<p>— Chen Wangdao</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I read an article written by Mr. Shen Qiyu in a certain newspaper entitled "On Sad Literature," which roughly stated: In this war of resistance, "there are countless sad events happening," which should be used to write "sad literature." "Literature that expresses this true emotion can only inspire people from sadness to anger to grandeur, and there is no other adverse effect." However, "falsely expressing emotions and forcibly writing positive works," "what is seen is mostly "how are 450 million people," and in the end, it is "final victory belongs to us," which is not necessarily "popular or produces good results." In the article, he cited a reader's letter as proof for the latter, and for the former, he seemed to use himself as proof, saying:</p>
<p>"I have recently often loved to shed tears, shed when I saw my air force bravely night raid, shed when I saw the heroic sacrifice of wounded soldiers and homeless refugees, and when my wife and children were scattered, naturally, I also shed. However, I have not been decadent or desperate because of these sorrows, but on the contrary, I have strengthened my heart because of this. If there is any opportunity, I will not hesitate to die on this path of saving the nation."</p>
<p>"Not hesitating to die" is "grandeur," and this kind of grandeur sadness does not seem to be included in the single word "sadness." In reality, there will be people who "collapse and despair from sadness," and there will also be people who "become angry and grand from sadness." The difference lies in whether the emotion of sadness is combined with a strong will. A sad emotion connected with a strong will will be an emotion that is both grand and sad, making people feel sad and painful, but also feeling a sublime and heroic emotion, which is the so-called tragic feeling. There are originally many literatures in our country that are good at expressing tragic emotions and describing tragic facts, and now is the period when this kind of literature is produced. Countless tragic facts are constantly appearing, and we will definitely have countless tragic literature constantly produced.</p>
<p>These days, tens of thousands of Shanghai citizens are enthusiastically praising and assisting the eight hundred soldiers who died defending Zhabei, which is only natural, because this is the most clearly seen and understood tragic fact among countless tragic facts, and it is a typical example of dying to resist the strong with the weak produced by a strong will.</p>
<p>Literature that expresses these kinds of large and small examples should not simply pile strong will on paper and erase the sad emotions completely. But our war of resistance this time needs strong will too much. We are all forced to train ourselves into people who do not laugh easily or cry easily, like people made of iron and bronze who are not easily shaken. This is easy for some people to do, but not easy for others, but we must also abide by the so-called "not arrogant in victory, not discouraged in defeat" call, and also use some kind of form to call on others. We do not have time to concretize, nor to emotionalize. This forms the so-called "set." The shortcoming of this "set" is not so much "falsely expressing emotions," it seems, as it is being one-sidedly fixed on concepts. However, no matter how you say it, I agree with Mr. Shen that we should "write a little more personally" in literature.</p>
<p>However, in the will to resist the war and in the understanding of resisting the war, we are exactly requesting a "set." We are exactly still worried that the "set" has not gone deep enough, not popularized enough. We are still needing to promote popular education, to develop popular recognition, and to harmonize the will of the masses. In this area, phrases expressing determination and resolve are not annoying to speak a hundred times, not annoying to shout a hundred times, and not annoying to sing a hundred times. The students in the school diagonally opposite have been singing "Arise, you who do not want to be slaves! Let us build our new Great Wall with our flesh and blood!" countless times tonight. Listening to the sound getting stronger and stronger, they will probably continue singing it countless times. They are using the method of singing hundreds of times to train themselves and experience the tragic emotion of our movement to resist the enemy and save the nation. Resisting the enemy and saving the nation is a matter of life and death for the Chinese nation in the near future, and it must be dealt with with a broad mind. We must make friends with the most reliable friendly countries abroad, and we cannot but arouse the people at home to participate in the resistance together. All those who make a contribution to this, no matter how little, can be considered strength. We hope that all parties will relax their prejudices on this major matter, and the same goes for literature. Literature that is one-sidedly fixed on concepts may be due to the fact that it is too eager to do its best in this popular education. Or it may be because life is too one-sided and we have not experienced various scenes of the war of resistance. If it is due to the latter, it can naturally change with the change of life. The progress of reportage literature since August 13 is a clear proof. If it is due to the former, then it seems better not to change the original intention.</p>

<h3>Enemy Forces Attempt Three-Pronged Crossing of Suzhou Creek, Encircled and Annihilated by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Enemy Briefly Penetrates Toyota Mill but is Repelled; Our Defense Line Slightly Retreated East of Xiaonanxiang; Fierce Enemy Assault on Guangfu Town, Lao Lu Residence Lost and Regained</p>
<p>According to war reports received by this newspaper this afternoon, the main focus of the battles along the entire front remains on the central and right flank lines. On the right flank, starting yesterday morning and continuing until dawn today, the enemy launched continuous southward attacks within a 24-hour period along the Suzhou Creek from Fanhuang Iron Bridge westward to the northern bank of Shenji Bang (i.e., Yaojiadu). Our troops defended firmly on the southern bank, repelling numerous enemy attempts to cross the river. However, under the cover of heavy artillery and smoke screens, the enemy managed to force crossings at Beixin Jing and Zhoujia Bridge, though in small numbers. Last night, these enemy troops were encircled and annihilated by our forces, leaving no enemy presence on the southern bank. It is estimated that 50 to 60 rifles were seized at Beixin Jing and 20 to 30 at Zhoujia Bridge. Few survived, with most drowning in the river. This morning around 3 a.m., unwilling to accept complete failure at the aforementioned locations, the enemy dispatched approximately one company of infantry, attempting to cross the river stealthily near the Zhongshan Road Bridge. They were suppressed by our machine gun fire. However, a small detachment of approximately 20 enemy soldiers managed to reach positions near the Toyota Mill. They were then subjected to several attacks by our troops, and, lacking a firm foothold, they immediately collapsed and retreated. We seized over a dozen rifles. After dawn, the enemy resorted solely to artillery bombardment, which our troops met with calm resistance, holding firm. As of noon, both sides were engaged in a standoff across the river. On the central front, the enemy continues to pursue a central breakthrough strategy, aiming for Nanxiang. They have launched vigorous attacks along this line in recent days. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the enemy again used over 30 tanks to cover their infantry, launching fierce attacks on Wangtang Bridge, Zhangxian Temple, Xiejia Zhai, and other locations. They were repelled multiple times by our forces, resulting in intense fighting and heavy enemy casualties. Later, enemy tanks broke through, forcing our troops to retreat and abandon those locations, holding firm along the Zhuyuan, Shiditang, Qiujia Zhai, Aibang Tou, and Sijia Bridge line. On the left flank, the enemy's objective appears to be focused on the Guangfu line. Yesterday afternoon at 4:40 p.m., a unit of the enemy's 2nd Division launched a fierce attack on Lao Lu Residence south of Guangfu. The village was temporarily lost but was retaken by our forces with a counterattack at 10 p.m., resulting in the deaths of many enemy soldiers. It is also learned that the enemy is currently attempting to use their main army to attack Nanxiang, while their naval infantry operates south of Suzhou Creek, and their aircraft bombard our positions and rear transportation hubs.</p>

By late night, the enemy forces at Zhoujia Bridge and Liujia Zhai had been annihilated. Furthermore, the enemy had erected two canvas bridges in the Liujia Zhai area, one of which we have destroyed.

<h3>Russian Representative Departs for Belgium to Attend Nine-Power Conference</h3>
<p>Philippine Democratic System Protection Alliance Resolves to Condemn Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>[Moscow] After accepting the invitation from this country and agreeing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government appointed Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Maxim Litvinov, Deputy Commissar Bodan Kin, and Minister to Belgium Rubin Ning as representatives. Litvinov and Bodan Kin (one person) departed for Brussels at 10 p.m. this evening. Belgian Minister to the Soviet Union Leidelier and several Soviet government officials saw them off at the station. According to Soviet political figures, the Soviet delegation has high hopes for the attitude of the United States at this conference and believes that the only way to stop Japan's aggression against China is to rely on the United States. This is because England is prepared to support any compromise that maintains its interests in China and does not intend to take any further action. In the United States, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have both given speeches condemning Japan's aggression and explaining that the United States cannot remain isolated in the long term. Soviet political figures expressed approval of this attitude and believe that although there are still many proponents of isolationism in American public opinion, they hope that Roosevelt and Hull can turn words into action. In addition, the Soviet delegation will support the principle that all peace-loving countries must form a united front to confront aggressor nations at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, it is not yet known whether the Soviet Union will put forward specific proposals on this matter. (Havas News Agency report on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Manila] The Philippine Democratic System Protection Alliance passed a resolution condemning Japan's aggression and slaughter of Chinese non-combatants. It also called for a fundraising campaign to aid the wounded and refugees and preparations for an economic boycott of Japan. The Philippine Democratic System Protection Alliance is a private organization in the Philippines representing labor, students, and civilian groups. Only about 1,000 members attended yesterday's meeting. The remaining citizens were not allowed to attend due to concerns about disorder. In addition to Filipinos, speakers included one person each from China, England, and the United States. Many people from France and Spain also participated. Yesterday's resolution also advocated that the Philippines should "support all international actions to stop Japan's crimes of conquering other countries." (Reuters report on the 1st)</p>

<h3>Foreign Property in Nanshi Surveyed and Mapped for Enemy</h3>
<p>The enemy forces have notified the embassies of various countries stationed in Shanghai to survey and map all properties of their respective nationals in Nanshi and submit them. England, America, France, and other countries have complied and submitted the maps.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrive, Numbering 5,000</h3>
<p>At approximately 5 a.m. on the 30th, seven Japanese transport ships arrived in Shanghai. Three docked at the Osaka Wharf, one at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf, and the remaining three at wharves near the fish market. They transported approximately 5,000 officers and soldiers of the 6th Division, who disembarked at these wharves and were stationed in the areas of Wusong Road, Zhaopu Road, and North Sichuan Road. It is reported that they will soon be deployed to the Shanghai-Zhenru area to join the fighting.</p>

The remaining two escaped and are currently being searched for.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Calm Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shops Open as Usual; Residents Relocating to Avoid Casualties</p>
<p>The enemy forces recently issued a threatening announcement stating that they would launch a large-scale bombing of Nanshi. A reporter visited Nanshi to investigate and found that the situation there was still very stable. Most of the shops on Zhaojia Road, Fangbang Road, Xiaodongmen, and other main streets were still open. Police and trained citizens were maintaining order as usual, with a calm and composed attitude. However, many residents were leaving to avoid unnecessary casualties. Therefore, at around 8 a.m. this morning, vehicles carrying belongings crowded the areas of Xiaoximen and Laobeimen. By 10 a.m., the traffic was even more congested, and traffic flow was almost cut off. Fortunately, the police were able to maintain order effectively.</p>
<p>Because no one was home in Nanshi at night, bandits were rampant, especially in the Guohuo Road area. Among the thefts were the motor of the Hongxing Silk Factory and the entire contents of a tobacco and paper store. Therefore, the police and self-defense corps believe that these bandits are operating in the Nanshanli area behind Guohuo Road. They are conducting investigations and cracking down on traitors. Rice prices in Nanshi have skyrocketed, and demand is exceeding supply. Therefore, it was difficult to buy five dou of rice this morning.</p>
<p>The French Concession Waterworks is located on the Bund outside Bansongyuan Road in Nanshi. Therefore, many French soldiers were dispatched by the French military authorities this morning to protect it closely. A French warship has been stationed outside the Qiuxin Factory for a long time. Therefore, there are no concerns about the water supply.</p>
<h3>Czech Minister Pays Courtesy Call on Mayor Yu</h3>
<p>Czech Minister Seba, who has been in China for over two months and stationed in the capital, came to Shanghai on official business yesterday. This morning (the 1st) at 10 a.m., he paid a special visit to Mayor Yu at the Municipal Government Office on Fenglin Bridge. Mayor Yu received him cordially for a short time before he took his leave.</p>
<h3>Termination of Typhoon Warning Reports</h3>
<p>Due to the End of the Season for Typhoon Attacks</p>
<p>The Central Meteorological Observatory has announced that the season for typhoon attacks on China's coast has passed. From today onwards, typhoon warnings will no longer be broadcast to the Shanghai Coastal Radio Station. At the same time, the local observatory will also cease to provide reports on the direction of typhoons from today onwards. These typhoon direction reports will resume next July.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report</h3>
<p>Shell Lands on Huizhong Hotel</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st, an unexploded shell fell in a certain bathroom of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The Fire Brigade dispatched personnel to remove the shell upon receiving the report. Shortly thereafter, the Fire Brigade dispatched an ambulance to transport a team of wounded Chinese soldiers retreating from Zhabei to various hospitals for treatment. Fire engines were dispatched several times. There were fires on Yangshupu Road, North Xizang Road, Guangdong Road, and Wuchang Road. A shell flew into a house at No. 442 Heder Road, but the damage was minor.</p>
<h3>Casual Comments</h3>
<p>— Minister</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the London Times and the Observer have both offered commentaries. However, the views they put forth differ. The Times argues that peace in the Far East should be established first, and then peace in Europe. The Observer argues that peace in Europe cannot be contributed to unless the European countries make an effort to promote it. In other words, to establish peace in the Far East, peace in Europe must be established first. Both statements seem reasonable, but the first is more practical and appropriate. This is because peace in the Far East has already been shattered, while peace in Europe has not yet been shattered. It is like controlling water: if a dike breaks, it is best to quickly reinforce it, which will be more effective. If the flood spreads everywhere, it will be overwhelming. In fact, in the current situation, there is no distinction between first and last, or between East and West. The situation is such that pulling one hair can affect the entire body. But if this hair is not removed, the roots will grow deeper and the base will be more solid, and it will be impossible to remove this hair later.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Forcibly Occupy Hebao Bay in Guangdong to Build Airfield</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Carrier Moored in the Bay; But the Bay Has No Military Value</p>
<p>Guangzhou reports: Enemy warships sailing south are trying to obtain a base to open an airfield as a major base to harass our land, but have repeatedly failed. They are now using aircraft carriers to disrupt from the south, but fear our bombing retaliation, and keep changing mooring places, or simply have extreme panic because of supply difficulties. It is reported that the enemy once landed on various isolated islands overseas to choose a place to garrison, but because of the terrain of each island, it was difficult to land. Now the enemy troops have landed in Hebao Bay overseas between Taishan and Zhongshan counties, and are forcibly occupying it to build an airfield. This bay belongs to the seventh district of Zhongshan County, about ten miles long and five miles wide. The land in between is rocky and cannot be used for transportation. The water source is extremely lacking. It is usually only a place for our coastal fishermen to rest. The enemy troops were found to have landed on October 3, and simple wooden houses were built between them, rushing to build the airfield day and night, seemingly planning to occupy it for a long time. At present, there is an enemy aircraft carrier, three destroyers, and about 30 aircraft, half of which are seaplanes and half of which are heavy bombers. Those who have been harassing various parts of Guangdong Province in recent days have been flying out from there. However, in order to avoid being targeted, they take different routes for the raids. Usually five aircraft take the lead, with two aircraft on the side. A certain military expert said that the terrain of the bay is narrow and has no military value. As an airfield, it can only accommodate a dozen aircraft at most. At the same time, transport and supply will be difficult within a month. Even if the enemy obtains it, it cannot be used to park a large number of bombers. For the sake of self-defense, our province will impose severe punishment when the time comes.</p>
<h3>Six-An Cooperative Sells Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Enemy Goods Confiscated; Person in Charge Disciplined</p>
<p>Six-An Newsletter, Since the establishment of the Six-An County Anti-Enemy Support Association, the internal work has been quite tense. The association recently received a report that a treacherous merchant was selling a large number of enemy goods transported from Shanghai in Six-An. The association immediately ordered the investigation team to secretly investigate and discovered that the Gongying Bu in the Wanshou Temple District, three miles outside the west of the city, was selling a large number of enemy goods, including cloths labeled "Zhongxian Village," etc. The association sent Yunxiao Tuan, Xiangcha Tuan, and the Shangdian team to seal the seized enemy goods and report them to the higher authorities for strict handling in accordance with the law. The case has been pending for two months without a solution. Recently, Central Inspector Ma Yuanfang, Provincial Party Department Inspector Zhu Liyu, and Provincial Government Inspector Han Yisheng came to Six-An for inspection. The entire committee of the Six-An Anti-Enemy Support Association and the Zheng and Fu Zhuren of each group went to meet them and reported everything about the case in detail, requesting strict punishment in accordance with the law to warn others. At 4 pm on the 12th, the association held its seventh joint meeting. Ma, Zhu, and Han attended the meeting and unanimously agreed that it was unacceptable for merchants to sell enemy goods, let alone using public funds to sell enemy goods, which should be severely punished in accordance with the law to warn others. It was decided that: (1) the enemy goods would be confiscated, and non-enemy goods would be returned; (2) the person in charge would be reported to the provincial government and requested to be punished by the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the law. Thus, the incident of the Six-An Cooperative selling enemy goods, which had caused a sensation throughout Six-An City, finally reached a concrete solution.</p>
<h3>Hao Gengsheng Agrees to Unanimously Refuse to Participate in the Tokyo Olympics</h3>
<p>The Dissolution of the Far Eastern Games Still Causes Pain; This Time, the Condemnation is a Righteous Duty</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Hao Gengsheng, a sports supervisor from the Ministry of Education, previously represented China at various Far Eastern Games and Olympic Games, making significant contributions to the development of international sports in our country. Recently, Mr. Hao, in view of the sympathy of friendly nations towards our country's resistance against Japan, resolutely refused to participate in the 1940 Olympics held in Tokyo. He expressed his views on this matter and sent a letter to the Salvation Association of the sports community in this city, expressing his sincere support for condemning Japan's attempt to use international sports for its own purposes. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Hao's original letter to demonstrate his views (previous content omitted): He highly approves of initiating a nationwide appeal from the sports community to request all countries to unanimously refuse to participate in the World Games to be held in Japan in the 29th year of the Republic (1940). Recalling the Far Eastern Games held in the Philippines in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), the Japanese representatives brazenly disregarded international regulations and unilaterally disrupted the organization of the games. At that time, Gengsheng attended the meeting and strongly condemned their actions. Although the final result was a glorious defeat, the development of sports in East Asia suffered a serious blow from then on. Thinking about it now, it still causes pain. This condemnation by us is a righteous duty. Gengsheng is not talented, but he is willing to follow the comrades in the national sports community and work together for the future of international sports, striving to leave a foundation for pure development (subsequent content omitted). (It is noted that the 10th Far Eastern Games were held in the Philippines in 1936. Before the start of the games, the Japanese representatives妄想inviting the puppet Manchukuo to participate, resulting in a murky atmosphere that was unbearable. Fortunately, the Philippines understood the bigger picture and was able to make the games happen. Unexpectedly, before the closing of the games, the Philippines disregarded public opinion and colluded with Japan to privately amend the charter, attempting to allow the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the next games. Fortunately, our delegation, Hao Gengsheng and Shen Siliang, reasoned with the Japanese representatives Abe and Soya, and the Philippine representative Vargas, but the other side eventually failed to achieve their goals due to being in the wrong, and the meeting was adjourned. Although our side was saddened by the dissolution of the games, the spirit of independence and self-respect was praised by the international community).</p>

<h3>Recent Japanese Industrial Circles</h3>
<p>— Shi Ren</p>
<p>In the past month or two, Japan's industrial circles have been affected by the Sino-Japanese War. Except for military industries or industries indirectly related to military needs, which are showing active signs, other industries are generally sluggish. In particular, the textile industry, which is the foundation of Japan's nation-building, has suffered a great blow due to the war.</p>
<p>Looking at Japan's past trade statistics, the first half of the year is mostly an import surplus season, and the second half of the year is mostly an export surplus season. However, this year, February, July, and August have shown the opposite fact, that is, from the beginning of July to the middle of August, there was another import surplus of 136 million yuan. By the end of August, there was only an export surplus of 3 million yuan. As the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun" said, the situation is not yet optimistic.</p>
<p>Balancing Japan's international balance of payments is one of the fundamental financial policies of the country. If this phenomenon continues unabated, it will inevitably shake the foundation of the country. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Legislation Bureau saw this crisis and formulated the Trade Management Bill in late August, which is a completely wartime mandatory rule, consisting of eight articles.</p>
<p>(1) During incidents and wartime, the government, in order to ensure the operation of the national economy, can restrict or prohibit the export and import of certain goods when deemed necessary.</p>
<p>(2) During incidents and wartime, the government, in order to ensure the operation of the national economy, has the power to issue instructions regarding items that need to adjust supply and demand. A. The government has the power to restrict and limit products made from the raw materials of the aforementioned items. B. The government has the power to interfere with the allocation, transfer, use, and consumption of the said items.</p>
<p>(3) The government can request reports from or prohibit those who are related to the first restriction or prohibition or have been subject to the previous order.</p>
<p>(4) to (8) are penalty clauses.</p>
<p>From the above management bill, it can be seen that the Japanese government is making every effort to restrict the production and import of all non-essential goods and is focusing on the relief of import surpluses. However, in reality, its biggest goal is to promote military industries and suppress other industries. If we look at the raw material import restriction bill announced ten days ago, we can see its entirety. The bill consists of three articles, which are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(1) When restricting the raw materials for export industries such as cotton and wool, it must be in proportion to the export volume to prevent large-scale imports.</p>
<p>(2) After the raw materials are imported and become products, due to the soaring prices of these raw materials, the prices of these products are also soaring. Therefore, there is no profit to be made by exporting them to foreign countries for dumping, and they are instead sold domestically. All such behaviors should be prevented.</p>
<p>(3) Import raw materials from countries that practice exchange as much as possible, and restrict imports from other countries. This bill is almost exclusively designed to target the import of wool and cotton. Therefore, the import of wool and cotton will be greatly affected by this law. Japan's self-sufficiency rate for wool and cotton is only about 5%. Other countries rely on thrift. Once the import of raw materials is controlled, it should cause great panic. For example, the recent suspension of auctions at the Osaka Cotton Exchange is not without the influence of this bill. In fact, the most important thing is the struggle between the Textile Federation and the Department of Commerce and Industry, that is, in late August, the Textile Federation believed that the suspension of work due to the suspension of raw material imports and the influence of the Ministry of Finance's restriction on foreign exchange affected the purchase of goods, and requested ways to facilitate it, but the government believed that the amount of raw materials purchased this year was enough to manufacture until January of next spring, so it did not approve the request. Because of this war, general factories without cotton and wool stopped working, which not only created countless unemployed workers, but also shook the foundation of Japan's industry.</p>
<p>Similar to the situation in the textile industry, the electricity and steel industries have also been severely controlled, but because these two industries have a close relationship with military industries, they are not as painful as the textile industry. In terms of electricity, the possibility of realizing the recent national electricity policy has been seen. According to this movement, it was originally launched by the Hirota Cabinet, using Raimu's plan to nationalize the electrical business, but it was declared a failure due to the opposition of various companies and the collapse of the Hirota Cabinet. However, recently, under the influence of the domestic war, this movement has been promoted again, but the content has been slightly changed. It was proposed by the Political Economy Research Association and the Tokyo National Policy Research Association (the most powerful group in opposition, three members of the Konoe Cabinet and the secretary-general are members of this association), and it seems to have been approved by the Ministry of Communications. The plan consists of five articles, which are selectively translated below:</p>
<p>(1) Make the current electrical companies adapt to the national economic plan.</p>
<p>(2) Establish a special company to develop undeveloped electricity. Harmonize the advantages of capitalism with the requirements of the state's planned economy to become a new national enterprise model.</p>
<p>(3) The allocation of electricity and debt will be determined and promoted by the government from the government's perspective.</p>
<p>(4) Provide cheap electricity for special production projects in national policy.</p>
<p>(5) (Omitted)</p>
<p>This bill is of course beneficial and harmless to the government, but it is quite unfavorable to the established power companies, so it will be opposed by various power companies, which is expected. However, under the current circumstances, the power of the military government has dominated everything, and it is feared that the various companies will not be able to do anything.</p>
<p>As for steel, due to the expansion of military demand in various countries, there has been a steel famine, especially in Japan. Therefore, since this year, Japan's various difficulties and facilities caused by steel are too numerous to mention, such as changing import duty exemptions, mandatory surveys of steel companies, etc., all of which are noteworthy, especially the steel law published in early January is even more noteworthy. Due to space constraints, I will elaborate on it again when there is another opportunity.</p>
<p>Others, the most active industrial circles at present should be the emerging zaibatsu system. These industrial companies are all centered on military supplies and chemicals. For example, the Noguchi Enterprise Group, although it is based on the manufacture of light fertilizer industry, can become a major base for nitric acid explosion industry in wartime. The Mori Enterprise Group, although it is based on the manufacture of electrical machinery industry, but the aluminum it produces can be used as raw materials for airplanes and weapons. The Japan Soda Company, although it is based on the manufacture of soda, is a major base for the production of chlorine and other gases in wartime. Other companies, such as the Japan Industry Company, although it is not a directly military industrial company, it is actually a supply company for military industrial companies, so it has also had a noteworthy development under the influence of military demand. However, other companies, such as transportation companies and paper companies, have gradually shrunk due to requisition or restrictions. Therefore, in the current Japanese industrial circles, only military industrial companies stand in a dominant position, and other industrial companies have shown a decline. However, in reality, although military industries are active, their stocks are still plummeting along with other rayon, refined, and textile stocks, which is the most noteworthy fact. This matter has left the Japanese government at a loss. According to the "Tokyo Asahi" news on September 5, the Tokyo Stock Exchange is establishing a securities investment company to absorb a large amount of stock and raise its value. This kind of incomplete method cannot save the crisis at all. Therefore, it can be seen that Japan's general industry is already on the verge of crisis!</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of Youth</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>Everyone! You are all Chinese youth. Now that the country has reached a critical moment, you must be very enthusiastic, relying on the ability that youth should have, to fulfill the responsibilities that our youth should fulfill, in order to enhance the strength of resistance.</p>
<p>However, we must know that we do not necessarily have to go to the front line to kill the enemy to be considered resisting. We only need to take out our own strength. Simply put, those of us who have money should take out money to help the country, and those who have ability can contribute their ability to the country.</p>
<p>We must also know that our resistance is a long-term one, so our national salvation work is also continuous. Each of us should be responsible for training the people in our families and rushing to do some national salvation work. The elderly ladies can be asked to help make cotton vests for the soldiers at the front. The young people can participate in various national salvation organizations and serve in the rear. As for younger siblings, you can teach them three or four national salvation songs. Furthermore, the most important point is that we should analyze and explain the news of the war in the newspapers to the people in our families in great detail every day. These important and easy-to-do tasks need everyone to take responsibility for promoting them. I think everyone will not refuse, right?</p>
<h3>Jiangwan and Zhabei are Desolate</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Burn and Plunder, Leaving No Trace of Human Habitation</p>
<p>According to military sources, after our troops withdrew from the Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Dachang lines, all places were set on fire and plundered by the enemy troops. It was a desolate scene with hardly any intact land. Our country's residents had all evacuated in advance, so although the enemy troops occupied the above-mentioned places, they were actually in a desolate island with no trace of human habitation. Everywhere they looked was empty and silent like death. Even the enemy's Japanese spokesman even lied to foreign reporters, claiming that groups of Chinese residents had returned to their original places in Dachang, Zhabei, and other places, and were able to live and work in peace. This is completely a case of burying one's head in the sand and deceiving people. The reporters of various newspapers also sneered and rebuked his absurd words.</p>
<h3>Scene of Burning Civilian Houses in Zhabei</h3>

<h3>Traitorous Merchants Still Continuously Import Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>2.5 Million Yuan Reached in September; Seafood and Rayon Accounted for the Majority</p>
<p>The value of enemy goods imported in September, according to Jianghai Customs statistics, still reached more than 2.5 million yuan. However, it has greatly decreased compared to the same period last year. However, in this tense period of resisting the enemy, there are still traitorous merchants importing enemy goods, which is extremely crazy. According to reporter investigations, a part of it was imported after August 13, and most of it arrived before August 13, and those who went to customs to pay taxes and pick up goods in September were mostly seafood and rayon.</p>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>The Great Era</p>
<p>Wang Xinming, Xu Xingchu, Fan Zhongyun, Chuan Donghua, Zhou Hanmei, etc., in order to adapt to the discussion and practical research of issues during the period of resistance, published a weekly magazine called The Great Era. The inaugural issue has been sent for typesetting and is scheduled to be published on November 3. The content of this issue focuses on the study of the Nine-Power Treaty. Those who gave talks included Yan Huiqing and Shi Fajii, etc. Yan was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, and Shi was the chief representative of our country who signed the treaty, so their talks are especially noteworthy. The second issue will be a special issue on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The price of each issue is one cent. The address for correspondence is at the Times Building, No. 400, Fourth Road.</p>
<p>Zhongfeng Semimonthly</p>
<p>The inaugural issue of Zhongfeng Semimonthly is scheduled to be published on November 2. The main features include The Lone Army Firmly Defends Zhabei, Goodbye, Zhabei, After the Chinese Army Withdrew from Zhabei, Huang Qiuyue and Other Traitors, Common Sense of Poisoning, Demand Blood Debts, and many other articles. Each issue is sold for two cents and is available at all newsstands.</p>
<p>Front Line Semimonthly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Circle Wartime Service Corps previously published Front Line Daily to provide reading material for soldiers at the front. Due to transportation difficulties, it has been changed to a semimonthly, still adhering to the purpose of uniting to resist insults and promoting the national spirit. The inaugural issue was published yesterday and its content is very rich.</p>
