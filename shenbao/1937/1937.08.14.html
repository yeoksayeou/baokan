<h3>滬日兵昨晨首先挑釁我軍抗戰敵受重創</h3>
<p>日軍先挑釁俞市長抗議　我佔八字橋中興路橋等　敵撤滬西軍集中楊樹浦　今晨兩點半後炮聲隆隆</p>
<p>自華北事件發生後、日本軍部、卽派大批戰艦、紛載海陸軍士來滬、致滬市形勢頓趨嚴重、雖連日來經駐滬領團奔走調停、終鮮成效、而我保安隊及我衛國戰土、以日方種種違約、已忍無可忍、並為自衛計、因亦作相當準備葦抱與國北存共亡之決心、予打擊者以打擊、但該窮兵黷武之日本軍閥、仍是執迷不悟、竟於昨晨九時十分、突向我軍首先挑釁、而前日由日方所給領團之不先挑釁諾言、仍為日方破壞、我軍遂予還擊、茲將戰情分誌如左、</p>
<p>日軍昨晨首先挑釁</p>
<p>日陸戰隊約七八千人於昨日上午九時十五分、自北四川路日本小學開出、全副武裝，自虬江路口橫浜橋、以輕機關槍向我駐軍掃射、圖越淞滬鐵道、衝往寶山路、我駐防警察及保安隊、當予猛烈還擊、約越十五分鐘、日軍即不支而退、</p>
<p>兪市長提嚴重抗議</p>
<p>衝突發生後、兪市長當即以電話致日總領岡本、無如電話不易接通、乃正式提嚴重之書面抗議、並將抗議書錄送駐滬各國領事團領袖領事挪威總領奧爾、轉知各國總領、㊀致日本抗議書原文云、‘逕啟者、關於最近貴國海軍𪊦集上海威脅敝國之舉動、經本市長向貴總領事提出嚴重抗議在案後、本市長為維持本市和平治安計、曾與貴總領事約定雙方不得輕啟寡端、此事昨（十二）日在共同委員會開會時、英美意各國代表均皆聆悉、並可為證、乃言猶在耳、貴方陸戰隊於本日九時十五分、在北區地帶忽向本市區內警戒綫內衝入、攻擊我守軍、當經我軍沉着抵抗後、因我方不欲事態擴大、除將貴方挑寡部隊驅回外、並未追擊、糾粉旋即停止、本市長認貴方陸戰隊此舉、足以危害和平、妨碍治安、相應提山抗議、請煩查照、轉知貴國海軍當局尊重諾言、嚴切制止爲荷、此致日本駐滬總領事岡本’、㈡致奧爾函云‘啟者、今日本市長致日本駐滬總領事抗議書一件、關於日方今晨違背諾言、輕啟寡端事、相應抄同該抗議書函稿、送請查照、並煩轉知各國駐滬總領事知照為荷、此致挪威國駐滬總領事兼領袖領事奧爾、’</p>
<p>天通庵路連續衝突</p>
<p>日軍復於午刻、派出大隊、自江灣路日司令部背後、越天通庵車站火車過道處經同濟路、向我天通庵路八字橋等處警戒綫襲擊、卒為我守兵擊退同時另有日兵十餘名、由分水廟南進、過臨平路橋、入臨平路物華路一帶、警察局臨平路分駐所、據前方崗警趕回報告、該所所長亟率大隊幹警四五十人、上前應戰、尚有多處、均有小衝突、</p>
<p>閘北各處同時發動</p>
<p>下午三時餘、又復在引翔鄉·江灣路·八字橋·靑雲橋·及橫浜橋附近一帶、陸續開始戰𩰖、雙方均似利用小鋼砲與迫擊砲等互擊、惟砲聲並不甚密、故形勢亦不十分激烈</p>
<p>蘇州河北砲聲淸晰</p>
<p>昨日下午四時後、閘北方面一度稍歸沉寂、但六時未屆、而砲聲復作、約相隔一二分鐘一發、測其聲浪距離、均係日軍所發、而我方間亦還擊蘇州河以北淸晰可聞、至七時二十七分、寶山路及北站方面一帶、電炬忽然熄滅、砲聲仍賡統不絕、本報記者當時最感欣慰者、即自閘北一帶避入公共租界之貧苦民衆、雖露宿於街頭簷下、身受流離失所之痛但聞得我軍决心抵批消息、人人均表示極度興奮、愉快之色、溢於眉宇、足徵凡屬中華民國國民、無一不抱同仇敵愾有敵無我之决心、</p>
<p>四時砲中日司令部</p>
<p>迨至下午二時許、公共租界北區、隱約聞及砲聲三四響、蓋日軍首先發砲威脅、旋於四時、大舉猛轟大戰遂正式開始、寶興路近商務印書館一帶、中彈起火、我救火會當即出動、約一小時一度救熄、同時我方亦以重砲還擊、矗向江灣路日司令部、彈中其背、至七時許、砲聲益緊、清晰可數、我方部隊、士氣極旺、無不奮不顧身、爭先殺敵、刻正在繼續激戰中、雙方傷亡損失、尚無從調查</p>
<p>我軍迫近敵司令部</p>
<p>中央社云、九時許暫歸沈寂之前綫、至十一時半砲聲又作、惟每隔三五分鐘一響、戰事並不甚猛烈、江灣路我軍向前推進、現距敵陸戰隊司令部祇一千公尺、敵軍形勢頗爲危急、駐灘屋酒廠內之日軍二百餘、有被俘之設、引翔港方面、我軍亦佔優勢、前進頗速現與公大第一紗廠敵司令部之距離、步槍射程、可以達到、</p>
<p>我擊潰八字橋日軍</p>
<p>大戰於昨日下午四時爆發後、砲聲連續迄七時許暫告停止、緣日軍大隊據於八字橋中與路一帶、該處原在我防綫之外、蓋我用以誘敵自四時許、所有日軍、被我擊潰後日軍以重砲掩護後退耳、</p>
<p>中央社云、八字橋一帶、我軍於敵軍密集砲火下、奮勇衝鋒、敵不支潰退、五時半遂進至敵人陣地、而佔領八字橋、旋復跟踪追擊、佔領中興路橋、同時江灣路一帶、我軍以大砲向北四川路底敵陸戰隊司令部矗擊、有兩彈落於敵司令部附近、聞敵方頗有損失、又據未徽實消息、公大紗廠敵司令部亦被擊中一彈云、</p>
<p>日兵突衝不支而遁</p>
<p>當昨晨九時十分許、日本陸戰隊約三四十名、由日便衣隊前導、突向我天通庵路江灣路處衝人、將入寶山路時、日便衣隊首先開槍、陸戰隊步槍隨後而發、當時駐該處之我戰士、即沉着應忖、並以機關槍掃射、將首先衝鋒之日便衣隊陸戰隊擊倒十餘名、其他敵兵、竟即不支、返奔逃避、總計先後約戰二十餘分鐘、旋即停止、我軍未受損失、陣地鞏固、有備無患、至十時三十分許、日兵見天通庵路偷襲不遂、反受損失、乃改向東寶興路方面再團進攻、並挾有鐵甲車兩輛、作為掩護、當為我前哨瞥見、開槍對擊、時我隱伏該處軍士、即跟出迎戰、日兵沿途倉惶亂射、當又被我軍擊斃五六名、重傷六七名，日兵見勢不支即行退却、此次我方傷戰士一人、</p>
<p>擊斃日兵日婦遷避</p>
<p>迨至下午三時五十分許、日軍即開始以大砲鋼砲掩護、日兵紛向東體育會路·靑雲橋·中興路橋·八字橋等處、向我軍陣地作猛烈之攻擊、我軍鎮靜而待、以迫擊砲機關槍掃射返擊、因此槍聲密起、雙方相戰頗久、而日本便衣隊、更四出擾亂、希圖縱火、擾我軍心、但我軍心堅如鐵、態度鎭靜、且佈置嚴密、使日兵無隙可乘、一籌莫展、並予來者以重創、當塲擊斃日兵二十餘名、約二十五分鐘後、日兵又形不支、即退去、槍聲乃漸疏、惟砲轟仍未止、是役中、我軍砲隊、曾三次擊中江灣路日本陸戰隊司令部、擊毀該部房屋及牆壁、予日軍以不少威脅、因此在北四川路底之日籍僑民、大起恐慌、所有婦女一百三四十名、已於昨晚十時許、用運輸汽車三輛、由北四川路運至四川路漢口路口、日本所設救濟所內暫避、同時北四川路底、專任救護受傷日兵之大本營福民醫院、亦已於昨日下午遷避至外灘橫濱正金銀行內、並有受傷日兵五卡軍、於十一時左右、送入該院、由此已可知昨日至下午十時前為止之日兵死傷狀況矣、</p>
<p>日艦開砲掩護右翼</p>
<p>下午六時駐吳淞高橋之日艦、以巨砲向虬江碼頭至滬江大學一綫轟擊、聞滬江大學略有破壞、測其目的、係在試探我軍防守實力、並企圖掩護敵軍由右翼前進、我軍知其企圖沉着應付、敵艦約開八九砲、卽行停止、又江灣路一帶戰事至九時許、亦暫告停息、</p>
<p>日本三艦昨突離滬</p>
<p>上海戰事發生以後、日軍艦運來之大批軍火、在黃浦及大阪等各碼頭起卸、碼頭上之華籍小工、均自動離開碼頭、拒絕代卸工作、日艦無法、衹得自派陸戰餘兵⼠搬運、昨日午後、在滬之日艦隅田號·堅田號·及Kure三艘、均爲長江內吃水極淺之小軍艦、乃又突然離滬、駛出吳淞行踪至秘</p>
<p>日兵從漁市塲登陸</p>
<p>晚七時十分許、日兵艦二艘、駛近漁市塲碼頭、有陸戰隊二三百人登岸、時漁市塲內、職員工役等約三百餘人、見勢不佳、乃分批相率乘船向浦東東溝避去云、</p>
<p>日軍放棄滬西紗廠</p>
<p>原駐滬西中山路豐田紗廠之日軍約有三四百人、於昨日下午五時起用卡車十餘輛、分批撤退、所有大量軍火、亦同時運走、直至七時許始告完畢、雙戈登路宜昌路之同興·日華兩紗廠之日軍、亦定於今晨全部撤退、</p>
<p>我軍取大包圍形勢</p>
<p>據我軍前綫報告、我軍自開始與敵軍周旋後、全綫均已向前推進、如八字橋·方家木橋·以及江灣引翔鄕之綫、均有前進數百密突或一二華里不等、已在向敵軍取大包圍形勢中、</p>
<p>日僑男子入便衣隊</p>
<p>自日軍開始挑釁、雙方發生前哨戰後、所有未曾回日之日籍男子、據悉現均編入便衣隊、除担任間諜及擾亂後方工作外、並每以二三十名一組、身懷刀槍、出沒於虹口區域及租界各處、惟在虹口區域者、較在其他各處者標織較為明顯耳、尚希國人注意之、</p>
<p>我方部隊實力充厚</p>
<p>日軍侵略戰爆發後、我抵抗部隊、除保安隊外、已有富有作戰經騐之x×等師、開到增援、實力極為充厚、决可予侵略者以嚴重之打擊、聞日空軍今日將出動、我軍對此已有充分準備亦將予敵重創云、</p>
<p>滬大敎職員已逃出</p>
<p>昨日戰事發動後、滬江大學中美敎職員及眷屬百餘人、均在校內、因砲火猛烈、趨避地窑中數小時、至九詩許、始從陣地逃出、經公大紗廠被日軍包圍搜查、當均釋放、安抵租界、現暫住博物院路該校商學院云、</p>
<p>吳淞安謐泊日砲艦</p>
<p>吳淞方面昨日仍安靜、我軍已嚴重準備、當地各機關、為便利各方接洽起見、在桂枝路聯合辦公、淞滬火車前日下午一時暫行停駛、市輪渡昨午十二時後、只開到高橋爲止、故淞滬水陸交通、已完全阻斷吳淞張華浜鐵路工廠碼頭、昨由我方焚燬、防備日軍偷襲、記者於下午四時許、雇小輪離淞赴滬時、在張華浜灣浦江中、見泊有日本淺水砲艦一艘、高橋附近又泊一艘、砲衣均已卸去、守望兵時用望遠鏡、向進口船隻偵察、</p>
<p>實地踏查交界情况</p>
<p>昨晚八時至九時許、砲聲較密、戰事依然激烈、九時半後似在休止狀熊中、本報記者於十時許赴蘇州河北各處視察、北河南路海寗路口、市民徘徊觀望者、不下百餘人靶子路口、即有公共租界萬國商團崗位、鐵門緊閉、遙望寶山路上已成黑暗世界、十一時半許、曾聞砲聲一二響、及機關槍聲、但片刻即止、而東北角上、忽然紅光冲天、火燄殊熾、約一小時而止、當在日本陣地之內、界路一帶之鐵柵鬥處、均有公共租界萬國商團駐防、交界處交通絕對斷絕、且閒人不得臨近崗位、形勢十分嚴重、北四川路橋亦駐有日兵崗位、新亞酒店電炬全熄、朝北一帶、盡為日兵崗位行人絕跡、海寗路口之大利元票行門前、日兵疊有沙壘、由便衣兵及公共租界日警等駐守其間、而北四川路上之便衣敵軍、三五成羣、流連不絕、</p>
<p>字林報論歸咎日艦</p>
<p>本埠字林西報今日曾有社論、批評中日局勢、略稱、一日本軍事當局不信任外交力量、在華北取斷然行動、造成控制平津局勢之後、上海方面雖表示并無危害之企圖、但日來大量海軍之增援、頗非事實上應有之保證、此種增援、不能認為虹橋事件之結果、如在其他各國、則顯係戰爭狀態、此時情勞之嚴重、已不容否認、但追究此種情勢之所以造成、則由日本方面對中國情形之錯誤觀念、數月以來、日本輿論對中日衝突、均抱悲觀熊度、而陸海軍當局操切措置、以至如此、上海自虹橋事件發生後、雙方當局之力持鎮靜頗屬難能、但大量日艦之來滬、頓使情勢異常惡劣、若無力挽狂瀾之外交談判、則衝突將難以避免’云、（海通社譯）</p>

<h3>老實話</h3>
<p>— 誠齋</p>
<p>自上月七日，蘆濟橋事變發生以來，蔣委員長巳屢有明白肯定之宣言，為全國一致所擁護，亦即我國之國策也，國是旣有決策，人民無不樂從，一切咸在進行，但期拭目以待，本不勞更著餘詞，用資點綴，然人民期望之熱忱，與日內京華消息之沈寂，正且成為比例，因之態度，各異其詞，亦終無一是處，．汪精衛氏最近演說，謂國家危亟至此，應說老實話，敢本斯義，略舉所識，以祛羣疑。</p>
<p>人民於蔣氏宣言之國策，毫無間言，而懸揣所及，未釋於懷者，厥為目前應付事變，究純取軍事打動，亦尚兼特外交，若就軍事言之，建牙吹角，應在何時，全國動員，至何程度，若就外交言之，迥旋之中，有無餘地，最後希望，達何限度、凡此皆國民所欲問之老實話，而又或期期艾艾所不欲遽宣於口吻者也，今試條舉答之於左。</p>
<p>此次事變之來，原為日本檔逆相加，逞其武力，在我豈能順受，當然矛以抗抵，然抵抗之策，軍事外交，本可兼程同進，因之中樞首要，一面旣立具英斷，宣示國策，責成宋哲元守士抗戰，同時外郎亦公表願相商榷，求得外交上之辦法，奮抗戰所以治標，交涉所以整本，殊途同福，所以表我「柔亦不茹剛亦不吐」之政策，於義　至當也，不意宋氏徘徊於和戰之途者至再，遂至不能言和之際，而亦不能充分備戰，二十力軍，英勇可嘉，捍衛不屈，然臨渴掘井，已無濟於艱危，不轉瞬閒，平津淪陷，更有何交沙之可言，至日本一面黷武陳帥，一面以其國力上之考慮，乃至政府亦有持重之一派，固亦未必即欲全面用兵，因之疾風雷雨，復有不俟終日之势，而川越大使，遂先定於七月杪甫夾，惟七月杪正我平津淪陷之際，在彼旣有所得，不妨喘息少舒在我驛遭打擊，寗能默爾而息，蔣委員長痛心國難之日趨嚴重，因有第二次之宣言，川越以行成之人，聆此先聲，亦加考慮，遂又展主前日，遲遲始來，此在我國國策，不但戰事犧牲，已明徵其說，即外交綱要，亦有真體之範圍，倘不铁出範围以外，固無事不可商談，而一出範圍，自無屈受之理，截至今日，軍事準備以外，外交之門，本未深閉，但亦無所用其兼特也。</p>
<p>若論軍事，國策有應戰而不求戰之一語，方蘆馮橋事變之始，二十力軍固守勿退，是其嚆矢也，惟以局勢初起，旣尚在混沌之中，南北暌隔，又難得極度之聯絡，因之中央軍兼程北上，叫平津已告淪陷，去以軍事言，以國力言，我為弱國，無所諱言，以弱御强，可敗而不可拱手讓人，可犧牲而不可事以玉帛，此為弱國立國之道，亦正我國策中所大害特害者，今二十九軍因抗戰不勝而退却，應戰固未後人，支持極感難苦，旣為國人所共鑒，允符國策之初衷，現者時日少寬，後備較實，强敵之來，實有不奮勇應戰者乎，日人旣古平津，就軍專書之，亦難即此孤守，因之北攻南口延慶，冀併察省而通熱河，南窺津浦平漢兩綫，以資屏蔽牛律，蓋勢所必然之事，日內前綫較為沈寂，正以其一面從專平津之措置，一面竚候援軍之續來，我亦正得於此時期，妥為規發，耽耽負嵎之勢，正屏息以俟大戰之將臨，國人義憤填膺，爭欲濺其熱血，初不在須臾遲早之間，磨礪以須，正亦無勞頂卜其確切之時日也。</p>
<p>全國動員，本非旦夕間事，至何程度，初難斷䧋以相程，然日者自中樞至於各地，無論奉公職以及一介國尺，亦幾尸無不在動員之中，現代戰事，首貴建立簡當有效直捷統制之戰時體系，以𥙷承平時代百官端共之泄沓現者全而戰爭，雖未開始，而此項體系，正已熟籌有素‧將米需用之際，自必以第一流之人才，最少數之員額，最經濟之方法，最適宜之指揮，期得最鉅大之效果，最靈活之運用，可以斷言，又戰事旣將擴大方面亦須規劃量才稱使，因地制宜，𥨱以為政府亦必議有成竹，而各省大吏，先後來京，面聆機宜，各動厥職，更無待於推敵，此外後方之安定，人民之生活，乃至糧食之運藏，經濟之維持安老懷少，救死扶傷，雖以我新興之弱國，又向無戰時之經騐者，今亦一一急起直追，勉為其盛。縱不免於倉猝，要能見於設施，夫我旣預備澈底之犧牲，本無所用其愛惜，而今尚能統籌兼顧，希望國家多得一日之生存，即足與敵人多為一日之抵抗，則最後之勝利，必可操券以俟也。</p>
<p>舍軍事而言外交，外交之途經固在，然至今日而言外交，則外交之餘地亦窄，　越大使，駐華多年，頗知我國之情事，且身膺使職，豈不望國際。切，解决於專俎折閱之聞，然以其客年與張岳軍氏任外交部長時之交涉言之，彼此已極坦白之能事，而終不能得有結果，然憑其經騐，豈不更知丑國今日舉之心理，乃至所受之刺激，較客年為何如耶，推川越之心理，能以交涉謀中日兩國之和平，是其徇負，亦其夙願，若兩國兵刃互加，世仇永結，兩蒙其害，則為所不欲見而不欲聞者耳，今者渠之南來，固為此次返職後應到𩡶在國政府一行，然亦未始不可就其夙願，再謀𧗊最後之心力，余固敢為推定，倘專可得諧，彼必竭誠以赴，否則僅有潔身以行而已，然軍人所造成之事實，已至於斯，則留此迵旋，恐亦徒成檔案上一頁之紀念而已。</p>
<p>至於外交，在我固所不廢，而交涉之希望，無間朝野，自無不絕對奉行蔣委員長所宜言之國策為限度，是限度業已明確樹立，初無絲亳之彈性，足供雙方之折衝者也，平津已入占領狀態，日軍旣整旅入城，文告煌煌，治安方面，已受嚴格之統制，行政方面，日內雖無所聞，而其積極進行，不言可喻，方北平之陷落，宋氏猶以張自忠代委員長漸馮治安維持會成立，而張已辭委長入醫院矣，日者消息隔絕，併此維持會之設施，亦不之知，是常更有起而代此維持會者，而行政淌權之落於日軍手中，亦不問可知，謂交涉之結果，日人背以行政軍事兩權，金甌母缺，還諸我國耶，國人固宋敢作此不勞而獲之奢望，謂我肯承認損失若干實權而徒以收回平津兩地之名為巳足耶，則國策已有不能喪失任何領十與主權之明文，謂將諉之於地方當局，以其他折衷之方法，解此癥結耶則國策又有此後决無局部解决可能之規定，總之，兩國之間，軍事相接，彼已為事實上之占領，我已有四點立塲之國策，其中絕無通挪勝假之可能，縱使即此而止，已難成議，何况彼則尚求前進，我亦不吝犧牲，東因兩國國民之刺激，無時無地，均有新事實發生之虞調此時得由外交以解决一切，則運用外交之權力者，信能化臭豆腐為神奇，正恐非班外交家之所能及矣。</p>
<p>現茲舉國滔滔，人心興業，而首都以政所從出，奉公者參，尤為注意國事者集中之地，海茶餘酒後，資為談助，每僅皮相，而任何人又均不免於縍徨，友好相見，每加討研，惟有浮詞，從鮮誠語，余以感於汪氏之提倡說老實話也，故敢惟陳其事，以常喤引知我罪惟聽讀者之意是從可耳。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>上海大砲聲又響矣</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>上海大砲聲又響了。據日方宣傳。還斷斷於誰先開火。誰先啟衆但是這個問題。决無人能夠作證。亦决尋不出任何證據。不過我欲問者。卽日方近日開來兵艦。不下三十餘艘。戰士不下七八千人。試問目的安在。這原是鐵一般的證據。則發生此次戰事的責任問題。究當誰蜚。固可不辯自明。</p>
<p>戰索性戰。和索性和。不戰不和。亦戰亦和。在此種情形之下。我們不知吃了幾許的虧。自從蘆溝橋事件發生後。日方一面增兵運械。借題發揮。一面宣言事態决不致擴大。或用政治途徑來解决的口調來掩飾。這多是欺人之談。我國本不希望戰。更不願意戰。然爲日方步步逼迫至這樣地步。我們幾至無路可走。則惟有出於戰之一途。除戰之外。更當有什麼方法。足以控制帝國主義者之野心。除戰之外。更有什麼方法。足以喚醒侵略者的迷夢。</p>
<p>此時或者還有第三者的見解。以為戰端一開。必定損失他們部分的利益。或竟至被壞世界的和平。不惜煞費苦心。從中調解。不知此種行為。適以助長敵人的兇燄。㊀表示各國怯弱與畏權的心理。㊁使敵方在此時期。作充分的凖備。㊂懈怠雖希望和平而不能不出於一戰的心理。故此次平津的陷落。閘北的開火。非但和平之門已關。卽調解之路亦絕。</p>
<p>自從蘆案發生以來。我們抱定大事化小事小事化無事的本旨。與彼周旋。豈知我們退一步。他們便進兩步。我們退一寸。他們便進一尺。遂使我們到退無可退的地步。總之和平之門。我方本來常開。但到現在早被日方一扇一扇的關閉起來了。蘆溝橋之役。被日人關了一扇。廊坊之役。又被日人關了一扇。平津一役。又把和平的大門關上了。到現在閘北一役。連和平的後門而亦關閉起來。現在如何。惟有戰。惟有拚命戰。</p>
<p>不問勝負。不談利害。我們惟有拚全民族的生命。與敵人相肉搏。我們惟有賭國家的命運。與敵人相周旋。必使敵人受絕大的痛傷而後已。迄記者屬稿時。八字橋天通庵的砲聲還在震天震地的響。我們佔領了某處。佔據了某廠的消息。連績報來我想我們英勇氣槪的將士們。正是衝鋒陷陣得心應手時也。</p>

<h3>今日交通之急要問題（二）</h3>
<p>— 銳靈</p>
<p>（四）中國鐵路，因爲歷史複雜的關係，因爲投資背景不同的關係，各路對於車輛和機工方面的設備，都認爲是一路的私產，對於他路，界限分明，不肯通融，甚至有時候有些路有軍沒有貨可運，有些路則有貨而沒有車可運。九一八事變前，北寗路因歷次奉軍入關所扣各路車輛甚多，擁有最多的車輛，然而結果，大部份却終於送給敵人了！一直到最近，北寗路所擁有的車輛，照路綫長短為比例，仍然較其他各路為多，然而現在又送給敵人了，鐵部不能全權調度所有各路東輛，致失事機，不能不說是重要原因之一。其實，都是國有鐵路，都是國家資產，只看怎樣運用最有效，怎樣運用最適宜，爲什麼要分甚麼甲路所有，乙路所有？即令因爲經濟背景不同的關係，我們盡可以在會計方面設法各別記載，調度則應該集中統一，尤其現在事機緊迫，應將全國各路所有車輛一律部有化，由鐵部集中調度，就事實需要，分配相當數目於各路，此項撥歸各路駛用之數目，得隨時按情形變更之。在調度時，對危險區域內如膠濟路東段等，行駛及留置車輛應减至最少數，以免事變突發，不及撤退，致為敵所利用。此後自國外新購到之車輛無論用何路出資所購，除在會計方面，予以適宜之處置外，亦一律作爲部有，由部調遣。</p>
<p>（五）戰事倘爆發後，旣為持久戰，對於前方軍事運輸，必須力求敏捷，對於後方貨物流通，必須力求合理，故在前方應有統一之調遣機關，在後方應實行運輸統制之方法，此事頭緒萬端，非專文不能盡其詳。簡單言之，在前方最忌令出多門，使從事者無所適從，致成紊亂之𧰼，故應有一最高調遣機關，非經機關之命令，各軍不得任意索車，非經此機關之核准，各軍不得任意運送非急需之件，關於車輛容積應速定出標凖，如步兵每車可坐若干人，每師需車若干輛，騎兵及其馬匹每車可容若干，每師需車若干輛，砲兵及其所携之砲，每車可容𨞋干，每旅需車若干輛，給養之運送與分配，應如何規定，傷兵之運送，又應如何敏捷，凡此，固應有周密之計劃，尤應有適宜之調遣，至於後方，何種貨物，宜於水運，何種貨物，可由公路，何種貨物，必用火車，其他與軍事國防無關，或與國民經濟無益之貨物，如何拒絕或減少其運輸，關於各地生活必需品，應如何源源輸送，使不發生恐慌，對於出口貨物，應如何予以種種便利，俾可交換國外資金，以增加作戰力量目前急要工作，在前方應速成立統一之軍事運輸調度機關，在後方應速根據過去貨物流通情形，籌備實施統制辦法，中國煤鑛，多在華北，戰事爆發後，各大都市之燃料問題，尤應早為顧及，如能維持原來運輸狀况，源源繼續供給固最佳，否則何處可得代用品，如何以適應此新形勢，亦應預為之計，不獨燃料問題之運輸如此，其他生活必需品之運輸，亦如此也。</p>
<p>（六）各路重要處所，應速儲集修理材料，現代戰爭，空軍破壞之力量至大，凡可為空軍轟炸之目標者，應多備修理材料，以備隨時修理，恢復通車，重要橋樑，尤多此項需要。故對於建造便橋之木材及零件，應早充分準備，預備各重要橋樑附近，以備不時之需，担仍應置於最安全處，以防落入敵手，或爲敵破壞。</p>
<p>（七）長江及其支流，爲我國中部交通最重要衝衢，且係水道，可不處敵機之炸毁，故一旦戰事爆發，我們必須能充分利用長江及其支流，以維持我們的交通。我們要能充分利用，一方面須保障水道的安全，一方面還須有水上運輸的工具。我們的海軍太弱，我們在沿海沒有活動的餘地，將來沿海運輸，只能利用外國商船，但是長江水道運輸，則必須由我們自己負起責任，我們應該在適當時機，把所有可以移到長江航行的航輪，都開到長江以內，商輪如此，軍艦也應如此，積極的作用，可以在戰時負起內河水上運輸的責任，消極的作用，可以避免敵艦的砲轟利捕虜，海軍集中長江以後，可以扼要守住長江下遊險要，使敵艦不能駛進。如果有敵艦仍未退出，亦惟有解除其武裝，這樣水上安全才可以有保障，商輪除防備空中襲擊外，可以暢行，海軍軍艦，在必要的時候，也可帮助作運輸之用。我覺得我們現在已經到了應該將所有海軍與航輪，分別集中到長江珠江，以及其他内河的時候了！看！日本已經徵用其國內所有商船運輸軍隊了，已經命令在華營業的日輪也回國擔任軍事運輸了！而且，除此以外，更另外向英國商人租用輪船兩艘，以加强其運輸能力了！日僑一批一批的退回本國了！大戰就在目前，我們還能讓我們自己的商輪自上海向華北航行，向華南航行，預備做日本海軍的捕虜品嗎？趕快集中起來，在海軍保護之下分散到長江各地，預備負起未來對於戰時內河交通的重大使命罷！所以我們對於沿海航行，在這個非常時候，不妨暫時對外國商輪退讓一步，最低限度，我們應該將班次減至最少！我們如果在戰時不能利用長江作戰時的運輸要道，充分發揮其運輸能力，那我們無異乎自己割斷了自己的動脈，我們還望能運轉自如嗎？到時候我們已經不能只考慮、個時候的利害，應從大處遠處着眼，願海軍當局注意！</p>

<h3>防空淺說</h3>
<p>自從有了空軍以後，戰爭已由平面變咸立體，就是說，前綫陳地儘是十分堅固，但是敵人的飛機，會飛到後方重要地點，肆行轟炸，摧殘我們的政治中心地，經濟中心地，破壞我們的工廠，以及轟斷我們的交通，使我們精神及物質，均受到嚴重的打擊，所以現在有句口號說，“無防空，即無國防”這不是故甚其辭。</p>
<p>大概說起來，防空可以分作積極同消極二種，積極防空，是軍隊的責任，而消極防空是需要我們民衆一致起米擔負這個責任。</p>
<p>什麼呌做消極防空呢，就是當敵人的飛機要來轟炸我們的時候，想出種種方法，以求減少損害，要能擔任這種任務，自然應當受很嚴格的訓練，但是有幾點常識，要是做得到，也可以減少許多的損害，現在把他寫在下面。</p>
<p>一，燈火管制</p>
<p>假如我們有積極防空的話，敵人的飛機，為求達到任務起見，大都是在夜裹進襲的，當時天昏地黑，都市的燈光，就是他最好的指南針了，所以我們的燈火，揀不需耍的應當老早就熄滅不用，必要的燈火，也應該遮藏起來，使他的光亮，不透露到外邊，同時烟囪裹發出來的火光，鎔鐵時候的光亮，統統應當遮蔽起來，要曉得一盞燈的燈光不隱蔽，就可以使全部的燈火會制變為無效，遮蔽的地方，最要緊的是窗上用三層厚黑布遮起來，室內的電燈，也用長逾一尺的黑布，四面包住，使他光亮紙能向下，不致外洩，移動的燈光，像汽車燈之類，應賞用金屬品做成套筒，脚踏車燈之類，都可以用黑布完全包起，總之，不使有一綫光亮給飛機看見。</p>
<p>二，消防</p>
<p>用燃燒彈來引起火災，是飛機攻擊都市的狠毒辦法，假定不立即撲滅，就要受到重大的損害，平時發生火災當然要靠消防隊的力量，但是起火的地點一多，消防隊就要顧此失彼，所以各人應當把家裹容易起火的東西搬開，不幸中了燃燒彈的時候，應當在沒有成災以前，立即撲滅他，但是要注意，燃燒彈用水是撲滅不了的，所以每家至少應淮備黃沙兩擔鐵剷一只，燃燒彈落下時用剷將沙流下去，才是頂好的消防方法，同時每個家裹應有一兩個人留守，擔任本宅的消防，如鄰屋起火，也要優力幫忙，如不能撲滅時，當用鎮靜而迅速的方法通知消防隊。</p>
<p>三，救護</p>
<p>中傷中毒，當然要請醫生診治，在沒有送到醫院之前，最好施行消毒，如係出血，亦應設法止住，講到出血的原因，可以分成三種，一種是動脈破裂，血漂出得很有力，血色鮮紅，一種是靜脈破裂，血出得也很多，但是較為和緩，血色發紫，這種出血都很危險，因為出血過多，就要不及救治，第三種是毛細管出血，是慢慢的滲出，這種出血算是頂輕微了，止血的方總，應當先辨明是那種出血，假使是動脈出血，那末應當在傷口近心的地方，用力將手指侵犯動脈管，直至不覺得跳（歡迎轉載）動為止——例如小腿出血，應常在腿灣部份壓住，假使是靜脈出血，那就是反過來，在遠心端壓扁靜脈，毛細管出血，用消毒過的東西，壓住傷口，不多的時鮫，就可以止住，壓扁血管，是需要較大的力量，血止以後，立即用止血帶或繃帶等緊緊紥住，送至醫院救治，所應注意的，紮住血管不能過二小時，時間邊久往往局部變死，消毒方法，最普通的是用雙氧水滴於創內，再用硼酸棉花輕輕拭清，再用稀釋之碘酒涂於傷口，消毒止血後，應立即送到醫院，如擔架不夠用，那末用短梯舖上棉胎，亦可應用，臨時擔架的製造法很多，像籐榻棕墊之類都可以，搬運的時候，要平穩而迅速，最忌震盪。</p>
<p>四、警報</p>
<p>警報是通知民衆應當作何種準傭的信號，第一應當把一切音響管制起來，以免誤會，第二應當熟悉各種信號，才不致弄錯，警報的符號附列在下面。</p>
<p>防空警報：</p>
<p>敵機要到的時候就呌空襲警報</p>
<p>一，電（汽）笛：喔——喔，喔，喔，喔，喔………——————————</p>
<p>拉響二十秒長音後，運拉兩響短音（共三秒鐘）即停止兩秒鐘，像這樣運拉六次。</p>
<p>一，幫鐘：⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙噹，敲一響後，再運敲兩響，噹，噹，像這樣三分鐘。</p>
<p>敵機逼近的時候就呌緊急警報</p>
<p>一，電（汽）笛，喔——喔，喔，喔…………………——————………………</p>
<p>拉響三十秒鐘長音後，續拉短音若干次約一分點。</p>
<p>一，警鐘，—⊙—⊙—⊙—⊙—⊙—⊙—⊙—噹，噹，噹……急擊繼續不停，敲兩分鐘。</p>
<p>敵機已去的時候就呌解除警報</p>
<p>一，電（汽）笛，喔————繼續拉二分鐘的長聲（一次）</p>
<p>一，警鐘，⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙………噹噹噹噹噹………像這樣單獨一響一響的敲二分鐘。</p>
<p>此外還有兩種警報須特别注意</p>
<p>毒氣警報：</p>
<p>一，擊鼓（或敲洋油桶）咚，咚，咚，咚，咚，咚……</p>
<p>⊙—○—○—○—○—○……</p>
<p>咯，咚，咚，擊鼓三響後，稍停片刻後再擊一響，像這樣連續敲兩分鐘。</p>
<p>一，燈旗標示，白天有黃色旗揷在的地方，或黑夜有紅燈燃亮的地方，都是表示毒化的區域，</p>
<p>火災警報：</p>
<p>敵鐘，鑼聲亂敲二分鐘。　　五、警備</p>
<p>普通說起來，警備應當是軍警的責任，然而在戰時軍警一齊都到前方去抵抗敵人，那麼自衛的责任，就要民衆自已來負担了，所以在平時應當組織起來，加緊訓練，充份研究軍事知識，方能完成任務。</p>
<p>六、防毒</p>
<p>毒氣難然是可怕的東西，假使防禦得宜，也未常沒有辦法，在目前狀况之下，每個入都要有防毒面具及防毒衣恐為事實所不可能，應常用比較簡單的辦法，例如用炭酸鈉一兩，次亞硫酸鈉四兩，甘油一兩溶化在一面盆之熱水中，用紗布裹棉花浸在溶液裹，稍擰乾，拿來覆在口鼻上，也可以收防禦毒氣的功效，事熊十分繁急，用浸濕的手巾，或浸透小便的手巾，都可以暫時防止，所要注意的，碰到毒氣，應當頂風走，不要順風·走，至於挖築防空壕，同設防毒室那是團體防毒的有效辦法。防毒室是隔絕室外空氣的房間，進出口均用二道厚布幕隔住，內有糧食及消毒藥品等，假如室內人多的時候，還應有供給新鮮空氣的設備。</p>
<p>七、交通管制</p>
<p>自相踐踏的死傷，往往比受轟炸致傷還要多，所以需要交通管制，來維持秩序，並統制一切車輛，一方面使人民避難，得到便利，同時不致妨礙或有害於防護工作。</p>
<p>八、避難</p>
<p>老弱婦孺，在空聲的時候，應當退到此較安全的地位，担任避難工作的人統要指導民衆避難的處所及路徑，並且要維持避難所的秩序，至避難的塲所，當然是地下室最好，要是沒有地下室，那就要避到空地上去，或是指定的學校和公共塲所，假如敵人散放毒氣，樹林裹切忌不要去，因為那些地方毒氣不易吹散，走赴避難所的時候，要按着次序走，不可爭先，不要慌張，要明白慌張是沒用的，而爭先的給果是造成自相踐踏。</p>
<p>上面的八點都是容易做得到的事，衹要我們有堅定的意識，和努力奮鬥的精神，一定可以大大减少空襲的损害，這是我們所應當共同勉勵的，同時上海是國防第一綫，一旦有了國際戰爭，本市首當其衝，所以我們應當積極準備，現在本市有一個防護團的祖織，正在徵募勇敢的團員，加以組織訓練，準備替民衆來担負防護的任務，民衆們應當踴躍的參加啊。</p>

<h3>祖國的子孫</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>記得在五個月之前，我家隔壁一連五幢的石庫門房子都租掉了，搬來很多的機器。一個矮矮的傢伙，眼睛細細的，眼珠子却像老鼠那麼銳銳地看着別人，他用着一口生硬的江北語，支記着人們搬這樣搬那樣。我走进家，就對我的妻子說：</p>
<p>“啊呀！隔壁是被東洋人租去啦！並且，又是租的廠家，眞是麻煩！”</p>
<p>妻子的眉頭皺起來了，我們都不敢跟東洋人做“芳鄰”的，因為第一，為了東洋芳鄰是有過麻煩的，第二，我的弟弟因受了學校裹的救國教育，天天放學回家來，不是唱義勇軍進行曲，就是唱打回老家去，並且，在他簡單的腦子裹，因受着强烈的仇敵敎育，所以他時常咬牙切齒地痛罵着日本人。這樣，使我們擔憂了超來。在弟弟放學回家來的时候，我們一家人曾好好地規勸過也，要他對我們的“芳鄰”客氣一點，別鬧出不可收拾的事來。</p>
<p>弟弟倒也聽話的，對隔壁的小孩子也並不去惹他們，總是見了他們就走進家來。那個矮矮的瘦傢伙，他的老婆却是又高大又肥胖，並且，一點也沒有東洋氣味。我们全家也對他們有點莫明其妙。</p>
<p>可是有一天，那個矮傢伙到我家裹來了，他的一口生硬的江北話對我說：</p>
<p>“先生！借我一雙算盤好不好？”</p>
<p>“有的！有的！”我把算盤借給他了。</p>
<p>過了會兒，他是客氣地來還我了，從此以後，他時常見了我給我點點頭，我當然也很客氣地向他微笑一下，他的又大又胖的老婆却講不大來中國語，他的孩子們是只能講日本語，可是他們却很歡喜跟弄子裹的中國孩子們玩耍，而中國的孩子們總是帶着嘲弄的口吻跟他們玩，不時呌他們：“東洋小囡！東洋小囡！”</p>
<p>自從蘆溝橋事件發生後，對於那位“芳鄰”我是更加謹愼了。這並不是怕他們，怕的就是會有了一點蒼蠅一樣小的事，許會被他們的政府敲去一溧竹槓。有一天晚上，我在門口乘凉。那個矮傢伙拿了一份日本報紙，走到我的身邊，說：</p>
<p>“先生！先生！蔣介石要出兵啦！啊啊！”</p>
<p>我看他的臉上，正堆着滿臉快樂的笑容·我很是驚訝，神經過敏地覺得他不知會跟我搗的什麼蛋。然而，我還是客氣地搬過一雙凳子來，讓他坐下來。於是，我跟他攀談起來。</p>
<p>從沒有那麼跟他“懇談”過，這次談話，我才曉得他並不是日本人，他是中國人。可是他在日本已經住了十五年了，當他去日本的時候，還只十歲左右。現在，他的東家，（是日木人），在這裹開一個小廠家，因為他為人很是忠厚，所以要他在這裹支持，每月他有八十元的薪俸。他的老婆也是中國人，（江北人）孩子因為生在日本，所以只能講日本話，老婆却講不好中興話，所以不常講。</p>
<p>我問他為什麽還能講中國話，他很嚴肅地說：“中國人不會忘掉中國話的！”我就趁機問他：“那末你會忘掉中國麼？”他的神情更加嚴肅了，他說：“怎會忘掉中國呢？”他還告拆找，豐台克復的那天，他不知怎樣的，心中有說不出的快樂來。</p>
<p>可是他的觀念，因為受着多量的麻醉，却是非常的模糊的。他說：中國一定要跟日本合併起來才好，否則，大家不好“做生意”了。並且，他還認為東四省現在不是在日本人的手裹，因為有“宣統皇帝”在坐龍廷。我又問他：”旣然那邊有宣統皇帝，日本為什麼耍派兵在那邊呢？”我再問他：“日本兵隊為什麼要在華北打仗？他不是想吞併我們中國麼？”他聽着我講，就連連點頭說：“對！對！”最後，他說：“我過去倒沒有好好地想過。”</p>
<p>後來，他要求我把中國報給他看，可是他不大認識中國字，我就告訴他，我們中國，無論政府民衆，都團結在一起，準備抗戰，於是他興奮起來了，跳起來問：“眞的麼？我對他說：“不會，騙你的”，同時我問他：“假使中國跟日本打起來，你幫誰呢？”他一點也不加思素地說：“我當然要跟中國人在一起打日本的！”</p>
<p>在日本是已十五年了，可是他的血管裹，還是流着中國的血啊！啊！祖國的子孫，你是不會忘掉你的祖宗的血土的！我感動得跟他握起手來，過去我對他的懷疑，現在，我們兄弟一橡地握緊手了。（作者按：續者讀把這勿作文章看，是實有其事的事實啊！）</p>
<h3>保衛蘆溝橋（六）</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>大家正在紛紛議論着，橋頭上又有人在嚷了起來。大家把視綫集中到一邊，紙見丁大頭歪歪扭扭的走來。他滿臉是血，手上也是血，嘴裹咕嚕着：“你打，你打，……你打吧！反正完啦！完啦”</p>
<p>李五：“大頭，怎麼啦！”</p>
<p>王先生：“是給鬼子打了吧！”</p>
<p>丁大頭彷彿失去了知覺，兩只手在半空裹亂劃起來：“鬼子！鬼子！我……我不怕你，……給我把大刀，我砍—你們這些狗雜種……”</p>
<p>丁大頭的兩畝大豆是在路上的．自然給鬼子糟塌了。大家看了他的瘋如狂如的情形，蘇把他按倒，讓他安靜一下，先醒蘇醒。</p>
<p>李五：“我們怎樣活下去！”</p>
<p>王先生就說：“只有大家起來把他們趕走——趕出我們中國地方去，那我們才有太平日子過。”</p>
<p>“是的！一王先生握緊了拳頭：“只要大家齊心，不管是做工的，種地的，當兵的，都聯合起來！”</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Shanghai First Provoked Our Army's Resistance Yesterday Morning, Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Provoked First, Mayor Yu Protests; We Occupied Baziqiao, Zhongxing Road Bridge, etc.; Enemy Withdraws from Western Shanghai and Concentrates Forces in Yangshupu; Loud Cannon Fire After 2:30 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Since the North China Incident, the Japanese military has dispatched a large number of warships, carrying naval and army soldiers to Shanghai, causing the situation in Shanghai to suddenly become serious. Although the consular corps stationed in Shanghai has been mediating for days, it has yielded little effect. Our security forces and patriotic soldiers, due to various violations of the agreements by the Japanese side, have reached the limit of their tolerance. For the sake of self-defense, they have also made considerable preparations, harboring the determination to perish together with the nation, to strike back at those who strike. However, the warlike Japanese militarists remain obstinate and suddenly provoked our army first at 9:10 AM yesterday. The promise given by the Japanese side to the consular corps not to provoke first was once again broken by the Japanese side. Our army then retaliated. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Provoked First Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Approximately seven to eight thousand Japanese marines, fully armed, marched out of the Japanese Primary School on North Sichuan Road at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. They swept our troops with light machine guns at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Yokohama Bridge, attempting to cross the Songhu Railway and rush towards Baoshan Road. Our garrison police and security forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack. After about fifteen minutes, the Japanese troops could not withstand and retreated.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu Files a Serious Protest</p>
<p>After the conflict occurred, Mayor Yu immediately telephoned Japanese Consul General Okamoto. Unable to get through easily, he formally submitted a serious written protest, and sent the protest letter to the leader of the consular corps stationed in Shanghai, Norwegian Consul General Aal, to inform the consuls general of various countries. ⑴ The original text of the protest letter to Japan stated, "Sir, regarding the recent actions of your country's navy assembling in Shanghai to threaten our country, this mayor has filed a serious protest with your consul general. To maintain peace and order in this city, this mayor agreed with your consul general that neither side should lightly initiate hostilities. This matter was fully heard by the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy at a joint committee meeting yesterday (12th), and they can testify to it. Yet, the words were barely out of our mouths when your marines suddenly charged into the area within the alert line in the northern district of this city at 9:15 AM today, attacking our defending troops. After our troops resisted calmly, because our side did not want the situation to escalate, we only drove back the troops who provoked hostilities and did not pursue them. The conflict soon stopped. This mayor believes that this action by your marines is sufficient to endanger peace and disrupt order. Accordingly, I lodge a protest and request that you investigate and inform your country's naval authorities to respect their promises and strictly restrain them. Respectfully addressed to Japanese Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai." ⑵ The letter to Aal stated, "Sir, I am enclosing a copy of the protest letter that this mayor is sending to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai regarding the Japanese side's violation of its promises and light initiation of hostilities this morning. I am sending this along with the draft of the protest letter for your review and request that you inform the consuls general of various countries stationed in Shanghai for their information. Respectfully addressed to Norwegian Consul General and Leader of the Consular Corps in Shanghai, Aal."</p>
<p>Continuous Conflicts on Tiantong'an Road</p>
<p>At noon, Japanese troops dispatched a large contingent from behind the Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road, crossing the train passage at Tiantong'an Station, and attacked our alert line at Baziqiao on Tiantong'an Road. They were eventually repelled by our defending soldiers. At the same time, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers advanced from the south of Fenshui Temple, crossed Linping Road Bridge, and entered the area of Wuhua Road on Linping Road. The Linping Road branch of the police station reported that the police on duty at the outpost had rushed back to report. The chief of the branch station urgently led a team of forty to fifty police officers to engage in battle. There were also minor conflicts in several other places.</p>
<p>Simultaneous Launching of Attacks in Zhabei</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, battles successively began in the areas near Yinxiang Township, Jiangwan Road, Baziqiao, Qingyun Bridge, and Yokohama Bridge. Both sides seemed to be using small cannons and mortars to attack each other. However, the sound of cannons was not very frequent, so the situation was not very intense.</p>
<p>Cannon Fire Clearly Heard North of Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>After 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Zhabei area briefly returned to calm. However, before 6:00 PM, the sound of cannons resumed, with a shot fired approximately every one or two minutes. Based on the distance of the sound waves, all shots were fired by the Japanese army, and our side also occasionally retaliated. The north of Suzhou Creek could be clearly heard. At 7:27 PM, the electric lights in the Baoshan Road and North Station areas suddenly went out, but the sound of cannons continued uninterrupted. What made our reporter most gratified at the time was that the impoverished people who had fled from the Zhabei area into the public concession, although they were sleeping in the streets and under the eaves, suffering the pain of being displaced, all expressed extreme excitement and joy upon hearing the news of our army's determination to resist, which was evident on their faces. This is sufficient to show that all citizens of the Republic of China hold the same determination to fight the enemy, with no one willing to coexist with them.</p>
<p>Shells Hit Japanese Headquarters at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, faint cannon fire was heard three or four times in the northern district of the public concession, presumably the Japanese army fired the first shots as a threat. Then at 4:00 PM, they launched a full-scale bombardment, and the great battle officially began. The area near the Commercial Press on Baoxing Road caught fire after being hit by shells. Our fire brigade immediately responded and extinguished the fire in about an hour. At the same time, our side also retaliated with heavy artillery, targeting the Japanese headquarters on Jiangwan Road. The shells hit the back of the headquarters. Around 7:00 PM, the sound of cannons became more intense and could be clearly counted. Our troops were in high spirits, all fighting fearlessly and vying to kill the enemy. Fierce fighting is currently continuing. Casualties and losses on both sides are still under investigation.</p>
<p>Our Troops Approach the Enemy Headquarters</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the front line, which had temporarily subsided around 9:00 PM, resumed cannon fire at 11:30 PM, but with shots fired every three to five minutes, the fighting was not very intense. Our troops on Jiangwan Road advanced and are now only 1,000 meters away from the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters. The enemy's situation is quite critical. More than 200 Japanese troops stationed in the Taya Brewery are likely to be captured. In the Yinxiang Port area, our troops also have the upper hand and are advancing rapidly. The distance between them and the enemy headquarters at the No. 1 Cotton Mill of the Public University can be reached by rifle fire.</p>
<p>We Defeated the Japanese Troops at Baziqiao</p>
<p>The great battle broke out at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and the sound of cannons continued until about 7:00 PM when it temporarily stopped. The Japanese troops were mainly based in the area of Baziqiao and Zhongyu Road, which was originally outside our defensive line, as we used it to lure the enemy. After about 4:00 PM, all the Japanese troops were defeated by us, and the Japanese troops retreated under the cover of heavy artillery.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in the Baziqiao area, our troops bravely charged under the enemy's intensive artillery fire, and the enemy collapsed and retreated. At 5:30 PM, they advanced to the enemy's position and occupied Baziqiao. They then tracked and pursued, occupying the Zhongxing Road Bridge. At the same time, in the Jiangwan Road area, our troops used artillery to bombard the enemy's Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. Two shells landed near the enemy's headquarters, and it was reported that the enemy suffered considerable losses. According to unverified news, the enemy's headquarters at the Public University Cotton Mill was also hit by a shell.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Charged Suddenly but Could Not Withstand and Fled</p>
<p>At around 9:10 AM yesterday morning, about thirty to forty Japanese marines, led by Japanese plainclothes agents, suddenly charged towards our positions on Tiantong'an Road and Jiangwan Road. As they were about to enter Baoshan Road, the Japanese plainclothes agents opened fire first, followed by the marines with their rifles. The soldiers stationed there immediately responded calmly and swept with machine guns, knocking down more than a dozen Japanese plainclothes agents and marines who were the first to charge. The other enemy soldiers could not withstand and fled back. In total, the battle lasted for about twenty minutes before stopping. Our army suffered no losses, and the position was consolidated, prepared for any eventuality. At around 10:30 AM, the Japanese soldiers, seeing that the sneak attack on Tiantong'an Road had failed and resulted in losses, changed their direction and launched another attack on the Dongbaoxing Road area, with two armored vehicles as cover. This was spotted by our sentry, who opened fire. Our soldiers, who were lying in ambush there, immediately came out to meet the enemy. The Japanese soldiers fired haphazardly along the way and were again killed five or six and seriously wounded six or seven by our army. Seeing that the situation was unsustainable, the Japanese soldiers retreated immediately. In this battle, one of our soldiers was wounded.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Killed, Japanese Women Moved to Avoid Danger</p>
<p>At around 3:50 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese army began to use artillery and mortars as cover, and Japanese soldiers launched a fierce attack on our army's positions at East Sports Road, Qingyun Bridge, Zhongxing Road Bridge, Baziqiao, etc. Our army waited calmly and retaliated with mortars and machine guns, causing a dense barrage of gunfire. The Japanese plainclothes agents also went out to disrupt, attempting to set fires and disturb our army's morale. However, our army's morale was as firm as iron, our attitude was calm, and our arrangements were tight, so the Japanese soldiers had no chance to take advantage and were at a loss, suffering heavy losses on the spot. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot. After about twenty-five minutes, the Japanese soldiers were again unable to withstand and retreated, and the gunfire gradually subsided, but the artillery bombardment did not stop. In this battle, our artillery team hit the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters on Jiangwan Road three times, destroying the buildings and walls of the headquarters, posing a considerable threat to the Japanese army. As a result, Japanese residents at the end of North Sichuan Road were panicked. All one hundred thirty to forty women were transported by three transport vehicles from North Sichuan Road to the relief center set up by the Japanese at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Hankou Road for temporary shelter at about 10:00 PM last night. At the same time, the Fukumin Hospital, the headquarters for rescuing wounded Japanese soldiers at the end of North Sichuan Road, was also moved to the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund yesterday afternoon, and five military vehicles carrying wounded Japanese soldiers were sent to the hospital around 11:00 PM. From this, it can be seen the status of the Japanese soldiers' deaths and injuries as of 10 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Opened Fire to Cover the Right Flank</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM, Japanese warships stationed in Wusong and Gaoqiao fired heavy artillery at the line from Qiujiang Wharf to Shanghai University, and it was reported that Shanghai University was slightly damaged. The purpose was to test our army's defensive strength and attempt to cover the enemy's advance from the right flank. Our army knew their intention and responded calmly. The enemy warships fired about eight or nine shots and then stopped. The fighting in the Jiangwan Road area also temporarily ceased around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Three Japanese Warships Suddenly Left Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, a large number of munitions transported by Japanese warships have been unloaded at the Huangpu and Osaka wharves. Chinese coolies at the wharves have automatically left the wharves and refused to unload the goods. The Japanese warships had no choice but to send the remaining marines to carry the goods themselves. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese warships Sumida, Katata, and Kure, all small warships with extremely shallow drafts in the Yangtze River, suddenly left Shanghai and sailed out of Wusong. Their whereabouts are top secret.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Landed from the Fish Market</p>
<p>At about 7:10 PM, two Japanese warships approached the Fish Market pier, and two to three hundred marines landed. When the staff and workers of the Fish Market, about 300 people, saw that the situation was not good, they took boats in batches to Donggou in Pudong to take refuge.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Abandoned the Shanghai West Cotton Mill</p>
<p>About three or four hundred Japanese troops originally stationed at the Toyota Cotton Mill on Zhongshan Road in Shanghai West began to withdraw in batches in more than a dozen trucks from 5:00 PM yesterday. All the large quantities of munitions were also transported away at the same time, which lasted until about 7:00 PM. The Japanese troops at the Tongxing and Rihua Cotton Mills on Gordon Road and Yichang Road are also scheduled to withdraw completely this morning.</p>
<p>Our Army Takes a Large Encirclement Formation</p>
<p>According to reports from our army's front line, our army has advanced on all fronts since the beginning of the engagement with the enemy troops. The lines of Baziqiao, Fangjia Muqiao, and Jiangwan Yinxiang Township have all advanced by several hundred meters or one or two Chinese miles, and are taking a large encirclement formation against the enemy troops.</p>
<p>Japanese Men Join the Plainclothes Teams</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army began to provoke and the two sides engaged in preliminary skirmishes, all Japanese men who have not returned to Japan have reportedly been incorporated into the plainclothes teams. In addition to serving as spies and disrupting rear operations, they also appear in groups of twenty or thirty, armed with knives and guns, in the Hongkou area and various parts of the concession. However, those in the Hongkou area have more obvious markings than those in other areas. It is hoped that the people will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Our Troops Have Abundant Strength</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Japanese invasion, in addition to the security forces, our resistance forces have also been reinforced by divisions such as x×, which are rich in combat experience. The strength is extremely abundant and will definitely give the invaders a serious blow. It is reported that the Japanese air force will be dispatched today, and our army has made full preparations for this and will also inflict heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Faculty and Staff Have Escaped</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the battle yesterday, more than one hundred Chinese and American faculty and staff members and their families at Shanghai University were all on campus. Due to the intense artillery fire, they took refuge in the underground cellar for several hours. At about 9:00 PM, they escaped from the position and were surrounded and searched by Japanese troops at the Public University Cotton Mill. They were all released and safely arrived in the concession, where they are temporarily staying at the school's Business School on Museum Road.</p>
<p>Wusong is Peaceful, Japanese Gunboats Moored</p>
<p>Wusong remained quiet yesterday. Our army has made serious preparations. Local agencies are jointly operating on Guizhi Road to facilitate contacts between all parties. The Shanghai-Wusong train service was temporarily suspended at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday. The city ferry only operated to Gaoqiao after 12:00 PM yesterday, so the water and land transportation between Shanghai and Wusong was completely blocked. The Wusong Zhang Huabang Railway Factory Wharf was burned by our side yesterday to prevent Japanese troops from launching a sneak attack. When the reporter hired a small boat to leave Wusong for Shanghai at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, he saw a Japanese shallow-water gunboat moored in the Zhang Huabang Wanpu River, and another one moored near Gaoqiao. The gun covers had been removed, and the guards were using telescopes to scout incoming ships.</p>
<p>On-the-Spot Investigation of the Situation at the Boundary</p>
<p>Last night from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, the sound of cannons was denser and the battle was still fierce. After 9:30 PM, it seemed to be in a state of rest. The reporter of this newspaper went to various places north of Suzhou Creek for inspection at about 10:00 PM. At the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, no fewer than one hundred residents were lingering and watching. At the Target Road intersection, there were posts of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession, the iron gates were tightly closed, and Baoshan Road was a dark world in the distance. At about 11:30 PM, one or two cannon shots and the sound of machine guns were heard, but they stopped after a moment. Suddenly, a red light shot into the sky in the northeast corner, and the flames were very intense, which lasted for about an hour. It was inside the Japanese position. All the iron fences on the boundary road were guarded by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession. Traffic at the boundary was completely cut off, and idlers were not allowed to approach the posts. The situation was very serious. Japanese soldiers were also stationed at the North Sichuan Road Bridge. The electric lights of the New Asia Hotel were all turned off. The area facing north was full of Japanese soldier posts, and there were no pedestrians. In front of the Dali Yuan Pawnshop at the intersection of Haining Road, Japanese soldiers piled up sandbags, which were guarded by plainclothes soldiers and Japanese police of the Public Concession. The plainclothes enemy troops on North Sichuan Road were lingering in groups of three or five.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News Blames the Japanese Navy</p>
<p>Today, the North China Daily News had an editorial criticizing the Sino-Japanese situation, stating, "The Japanese military authorities do not trust diplomatic forces and have taken decisive actions in North China, creating a situation in which they control the situation in Tianjin and Peking. Although Shanghai has stated that it has no intention of harming, the massive reinforcement of the navy is not a de facto guarantee. This reinforcement cannot be considered the result of the Hongqiao Incident. In other countries, this would clearly be a state of war. The seriousness of the situation cannot be denied, but the cause of this situation is the Japanese side's misunderstanding of the Chinese situation. For months, Japanese public opinion has held a pessimistic view of the Sino-Japanese conflict, and the hasty measures taken by the army and navy authorities have led to this. Since the Hongqiao Incident in Shanghai, the efforts of the authorities on both sides to maintain calm have been quite commendable, but the arrival of a large number of Japanese warships in Shanghai has suddenly made the situation extremely bad. Without diplomatic negotiations to reverse the situation, conflict will be difficult to avoid." (Translated by the Haitong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Appointed Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Representative of the Shanghai Garrison, Xing Zhennan, and Others Host Reporters, Hoping That the Press and the Army Will Unite to Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhong, who served as the commander of the Fifth Army during the January 28 Incident and directed the 87th, 88th, and Er Divisions to resist the violent enemy, has now been appointed Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai. In addition to establishing the headquarters, Zhang Zhizhong has also appointed Xing Zhennan and Tang Wu as representatives stationed in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, Xing and Tang hosted reporters from local newspapers at the Atlantic Restaurant, with dozens of people attending. During the dinner, Xing stood up to deliver a speech, stating that in order to maintain peace, our country has repeatedly tolerated and conceded to the violent Japanese aggression. This painstaking effort is known to the world. However, the violent Japanese are insatiably greedy and keep moving inch by inch. Since the North China Incident, they have provoked hostilities everywhere. The Hongqiao Incident also occurred in this city. While our country is trying its best to seek a diplomatic solution, they are greatly increasing their troops, and today they are attacking our defenses again, attempting to expand the incident. For the sake of self-defense, our side has no choice but to retaliate against the aggressors. The current situation has reached the most critical moment. At this time of national crisis and survival, the whole country must unite and cooperate, and we especially hope that colleagues in the press will closely contact the army and jointly resist foreign aggression, etc. Xing also reported on the situation in Japan as discussed by those who recently returned from Japan. It is said that the Japanese warlords are militaristic, wantonly aggressive, and the people in the country are full of resentment. Recently, the government issued a mobilization order to recruit reservists, but most people are unwilling to enlist. Therefore, the number of people killed and committed suicide is hundreds in Tokyo alone. The Japanese domestic finances are also very difficult. Each soldier on the expedition receives 50 yuan per month for family expenses. Japan will definitely not be able to support this huge military expenditure for a year.</p>

<p>Nanjing Correspondence</p>
<h3>Honest Talk</h3>
<p>— Chengzhai</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred on July 7th, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly made clear and affirmative declarations, which have been unanimously supported by the whole country and are also our national policy. With national policies having been decided upon, the people are all happy to follow, and everything is proceeding accordingly. We only need to wait and see, and there is no need to add any more words for embellishment. However, the people's fervent expectations and the silence of the news from the capital are becoming proportional. As a result, attitudes vary, and there is no consensus. In a recent speech, Mr. Wang Jingwei said that the nation is in dire straits, and we should tell the truth. I dare to follow this principle and briefly mention what I know to dispel the doubts of the masses.</p>
<p>The people have no objection to the national policy declared by Chiang, but what they are pondering and have not yet been relieved of is whether the current response to the incident is purely military action or also involves diplomacy. If we talk about military action, when should the bugles be blown and the horns sounded? To what extent should the whole country be mobilized? If we talk about diplomacy, is there any room for maneuver in the twists and turns? To what extent can the final hope reach? These are all honest words that the people want to ask, but also something that they hesitate to say. Now, I will try to answer them below.</p>
<p>The cause of this incident was the deliberate aggression of Japan, displaying its military force. How could we simply accept it? Of course, we had to resist. However, the strategy of resistance, military and diplomatic, could have been pursued concurrently. Therefore, the central government first and foremost made a decisive decision, declared the national policy, and instructed Song Zheyuan to defend the territory and resist the war. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also publicly stated its willingness to negotiate to find a diplomatic solution. Resisting the war is to treat the symptoms, and diplomatic negotiations are to address the root cause. Different paths lead to the same destination, which is to show our policy of "being supple without being submissive and being firm without being aggressive." This is morally appropriate. Unexpectedly, Song hesitated between peace and war repeatedly, until he could neither negotiate peace nor fully prepare for war. The 29th Army was brave and commendable, defending the territory unyieldingly, but digging a well when thirsty could not alleviate the crisis. Before long, Pingjin fell. What more diplomatic negotiation could there be? As for Japan, on the one hand, it indulged in military force, and on the other hand, considering its national strength, even the government had a prudent faction. It certainly did not want to use force on all fronts immediately. As a result, there was a situation where the storm could end before the day was over. Ambassador Kawagoe was scheduled to return at the end of July. However, the end of July was when our Pingjin fell. Since Japan had gained something, it could afford to take a breath. We, on the other hand, had suffered a blow, how could we silently rest? Chairman Chiang was saddened by the increasingly serious national crisis and made a second declaration. Kawagoe, as a person who was about to travel, added consideration after hearing this first announcement and delayed his departure again and again before finally coming. This shows that our national policy not only states the sacrifice of war, but also has a clear framework for diplomacy. If it does not fall outside this framework, there is nothing that cannot be discussed. If it falls outside the framework, there is no reason to submit. As of today, in addition to military preparations, the door to diplomacy has not been completely closed, but there is no need to pursue it exclusively.</p>
<p>If we talk about military affairs, the national policy has the saying of responding to war without seeking war. At the beginning of the Lugouqiao Incident, the 29th Army firmly defended and did not retreat, which was its beginning. However, because the situation was still chaotic at the beginning, and the north and south were separated, it was difficult to achieve extreme contact. As a result, the Central Army marched north day and night, but Pingjin had already fallen. If we talk about it from a military point of view, from the point of view of national strength, we are a weak country, which we do not shy away from saying. Using weakness to resist strength can lead to defeat, but we cannot surrender. We can sacrifice, but we cannot serve with silk and jade. This is the way for a weak country to stand, and it is also what our national policy emphasizes. Now that the 29th Army retreated due to not winning the war of resistance, it did not lag behind in responding to the war, and the support was extremely difficult, which is recognized by the Chinese people and conforms to the original intention of the national policy. Now that there is a little more time, and the reserves are more substantial, if a strong enemy comes, will there really be no one who bravely responds to the war? Now that the Japanese have occupied Pingjin, from a military point of view, it is difficult to defend it in isolation. Therefore, they are attacking Nankou and Yanqing in the north, hoping to merge the Chahar province and connect to Rehe. They are looking south at the Jinpu and Pinghan railways to shield Beiping. This is inevitable. The front line has been quieter in recent days precisely because it is taking measures to occupy Pingjin and waiting for reinforcements to arrive. We are also taking advantage of this time to properly plan and prepare. The situation of stubbornly resisting is waiting in silence for the arrival of a major war. The Chinese people are filled with righteous indignation and want to spill their blood. It does not matter whether it is sooner or later. Sharpening the sword is also not to be bothered by determining the exact date.</p>
<p>National mobilization is not something that can be done overnight. It is difficult to judge the extent to which it should be done at the beginning. However, from the central government to various localities, whether it is a public official or an ordinary citizen, almost everyone is in the process of mobilization. Modern warfare first values the establishment of a simple, effective, direct, and controlled wartime system to inherit the dilatory pace of a hundred officials serving the public in peacetime. Now that the full war has not yet begun, this system is being carefully planned. When needed, it will use first-class talents, the fewest number of personnel, the most economical methods, and the most appropriate command to achieve the greatest results and the most flexible operation. It can be said with certainty. Also, when the war is about to expand, the government must also plan to use people according to their abilities and adapt to local conditions, so that the government must also have a plan, and the senior officials of the provinces will come to Beijing one after another to listen to the instructions, each performing their duties, and there is no need to push the enemy. In addition, the stability of the rear, the people's livelihood, and even the storage of food, the maintenance of the economy, the care of the elderly and the young, and the rescue of the dying and the injured, even though we are a newly emerging weak country and have no wartime experience, we are now catching up quickly and trying our best to do well. Even if it is inevitably rushed, it should be reflected in the measures. Since we are prepared for thorough sacrifice, there is no need to cherish it. If we can plan comprehensively and hope that the country will survive for one more day, we will be able to resist the enemy for one more day. Then the final victory can be confidently expected.</p>
<p>Leaving aside military affairs and talking about diplomacy, the path of diplomacy is still there, but today, the room for diplomacy is narrow. Ambassador Kawagoe has been stationed in China for many years and knows a lot about the situation in our country. As an ambassador, he must hope that international disputes can be resolved through negotiation. However, if we look at his negotiations with Mr. Zhang Yuejun when he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs last year, both sides had already been extremely frank, but ultimately no result was achieved. Based on his experience, does he not know better than last year what the psychology of the Chinese people is today and what kind of stimulation they have received? 推 Kawagoe believes that he can use diplomacy to seek peace between China and Japan. It is his duty and his long-cherished wish. If the two countries fight each other with swords and weapons, and the hatred lasts forever, harming both sides, it is what he does not want to see or hear. Now that he is coming south, it is originally to return to the government and report the duties to the country, but it is not impossible for him to make one last effort for his long-cherished wish. I dare to presume, if it can be successful, he will go all out, otherwise, he will only keep his reputation. However, the facts created by the military have already reached this point, so keeping this wiggle room may only become a memorial on a page of the archives.</p>
<p>As for diplomacy, we certainly do not abandon it, and the hope of negotiations, whether in the government or among the people, is absolutely limited to the national policy declared by Chairman Chiang. This limit has already been clearly established, and there is no flexibility for both sides to compromise. Pingjin has already entered a state of occupation. The Japanese army has entered the city with troops, and the announcements are bright and clear. Security has been strictly controlled. Although nothing has been heard about administration in recent days, its active progress is self-evident. At the time of Beiping's fall, Song Zheyuan still asked Zhang Zizhong to replace the chairman and gradually establish a public security maintenance committee, but Zhang had resigned from the committee and entered the hospital. Since news is cut off these days, even the facilities of this maintenance committee are not known. It is even more likely that someone has risen to replace this maintenance committee, and it is self-evident that administrative power has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. Can we say that as a result of negotiations, the Japanese will relinquish both administrative and military powers, restore the gold to the country, and return it to our country? The people of the country are certainly not daring to have such extravagant hopes of gaining something without effort. Can we say that we are willing to acknowledge the loss of some actual powers and only recover the name of Pingjin? Then the national policy already has a clear statement that no territory or sovereignty can be lost. If we say that we will delegate it to the local authorities to resolve this problem through other compromise methods, then the national policy also has a provision that there can be no partial solution in the future. In short, between the two countries, the military is in contact, and they have already occupied it in fact, and we have a national policy of four points of standing, in which there is absolutely no possibility of passing off something that is fake. Even if it stops here, it is difficult to reach an agreement, let alone they are still seeking to advance, and we are not stingy with sacrifice. Due to the stimulation of the people of both countries, there is a risk of new facts occurring at any time and in any place. If everything can be resolved diplomatically at this time, then those who exercise the power of diplomacy must be able to turn stinky tofu into magic, which I fear is not something that ordinary diplomats can achieve.</p>
<p>Now the whole country is surging, and people are in a state of excitement. As the place where the government comes from, the capital is particularly noteworthy for those who are engaged in public service and those who are concerned about national affairs. After tea and wine, they are used as a means of conversation, but only superficially, and anyone is inevitably at a loss. When friends meet, they often discuss and research, but there are only superficial words and few sincere words. I am moved by Mr. Wang's advocacy of telling the truth, so I dare to present the facts and listen to the readers to know my guilt is what is from.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Cannon Fire Resounds Again</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The cannon fire in Shanghai has resumed. According to Japanese propaganda, it is adamantly uncertain who fired first, who initiated the conflict. However, no one can testify to this question, nor can any evidence be found. However, what I want to ask is, in recent days, the Japanese have brought no fewer than thirty warships and no fewer than seven or eight thousand soldiers. I ask, what is the purpose? This is ironclad evidence. Therefore, the question of responsibility for this war, who should be blamed, is self-evident.</p>
<p>To fight, then fight outright; to make peace, then make peace outright. Neither fighting nor making peace, fighting and making peace at the same time. Under such circumstances, we do not know how much we have suffered. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has been increasing troops and transporting weapons, using the incident as an excuse to expand, while declaring that the situation would not escalate and using political means to resolve it to cover up their actions. These are mostly deceptive talks. Our country originally did not hope for war, much less want it. However, the Japanese side has been pushing step by step to such an extent that we have almost no way to go. We can only resort to war. Besides war, what other method is sufficient to control the ambitions of the imperialists? Besides war, what other method is sufficient to awaken the aggressors from their delusions?</p>
<p>At this time, perhaps there are third parties who believe that once the war starts, it will definitely damage their partial interests or even disrupt world peace. They spare no effort to mediate. They do not know that this kind of behavior only serves to fuel the enemy's arrogance. ㊀ It demonstrates the cowardice and fear of power of various countries. ㊁ It allows the enemy to make full preparations during this period. ㊂ It weakens the psychology of those who hope for peace but cannot avoid war. Therefore, the fall of Tianjin and Beiping, and the firing in Zhabei, have not only closed the door to peace but also cut off the path to mediation.</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, we have held to the principle of turning big issues into small issues and small issues into no issues, and we have been dealing with them. How could we know that if we retreated one step, they would advance two steps; if we retreated one inch, they would advance one foot. This has brought us to a point where we have nowhere to retreat. In short, the door to peace has always been open on our side. But now it has long been closed, door by door, by the Japanese side. The Lugouqiao incident saw the Japanese close one door. The Langfang incident saw the Japanese close another door. The Tianjin-Beiping campaign closed the great door of peace. Now, the Zhabei campaign has even closed the back door of peace. What is left now? Only war. Only desperate war.</p>
<p>Regardless of victory or defeat, regardless of gain or loss, we can only risk the lives of the entire nation and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. We can only gamble on the fate of the country and deal with the enemy. We must make the enemy suffer great pain before we stop. As of the time of this reporter's writing, the cannon fire at Bazihqiao and Tiantong'an is still shaking the earth. News of our occupying certain places and seizing certain factories is constantly being reported. I think our brave and spirited soldiers are exactly at the time when charging into battle is most suitable.</p>
<h3>Cracks Appear in Japan's Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Young Officers Control Politics; Veteran Statesmen Advocate Moderation; Konoe's Situation is Difficult, He May Resign</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A well-informed individual with intimate knowledge of the Japanese political situation stated that since the September 18th Incident, Japan's policy towards China has been controlled by the military. After the Lugouqiao Incident, young officers became even more arrogant. The Tokyo government can only deal with the accomplished facts and cannot put forward any proposals beforehand. The deterioration of North China and the increase of troops in Shanghai are all the work of these military personnel, seeking personal promotion and wealth. However, innocent civilians are being drafted into military service, and complaints are rampant. The huge amount of military expenditure is likely to lead to bankruptcy, which has already caused an unprecedented crisis in Japan. It is heard that major cracks have now appeared within the Japanese government. Veteran statesmen mostly advocate moderation and focus on economic development. The military advocates a high degree of autonomy for the five provinces of Hebei and Chahar, or at least a neutral zone for the three provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong, and free ports for Tianjin and Qingdao. The two sides are arguing fiercely, and some even advocate convening an Imperial Conference to determine the final policy. Prime Minister Konoe is in a difficult situation and may resign as a last resort. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>

When asked whether it was confirmed that Britain and France were sending troops to Shanghai, he replied that he had not heard of it. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:45 a.m. on the 13th. All cabinet members, led by Prime Minister Konoe, attended. They discussed countermeasures for dealing with the emergency situation in Shanghai. First, Naval Minister Yonai explained the situation in Shanghai.

The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to today's Asahi Shimbun, the highest authorities in Japan held a meeting last night to discuss the Shanghai Incident. As a result, it was decided that Japan should take strict action. This resolution will be submitted to the emergency cabinet meeting this morning for its approval. Those who attended the meeting last night included the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Naval Minister, and the Army Minister. Furthermore, Naval Minister Yonai met with the Prime Minister at 9:00 p.m. to report on the Shanghai situation and submit Commander Hasegawa of the Japanese fleet's "important recommendations" to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister then summoned the Army and Navy Ministers to discuss the matter together. The Army and Navy Ministers also separately convened their subordinates to discuss everything.

(Allied News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] As the situation in Shanghai continues to deteriorate, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, Prince Fushimi, convened a meeting of senior officers on the morning of the 13th. Naval Minister Yonai and others attended. At 10:00 a.m., four admirals, including Military Councilors Osumi, Suetsugu, Takahashi, and Fujita, were also invited to attend. Both the Navy Ministry and the Naval General Staff are extremely tense. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Due to the North China Incident and the Shanghai dispute, relations between China and Japan have suddenly become perilous. The government is making every effort to find countermeasures. Now, all parties are adapting to the situation in China and adopting a quasi-wartime system, which has become the unanimous opinion of the entire country. The financial authorities, based on the Konoe Cabinet's policy guidelines, must adapt to the new situation after the North China Incident when compiling the budget for the 13th year, tightening subsidies and other expenses, with national defense expenditures as the core, and adopting a wartime budget compilation. This view is also a powerful argument within the cabinet. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>Impeding the Interests of Various Countries; Japan Should Bear Full Responsibility</p>
<p>[London] The provincial newspapers are extremely concerned about the international impact that Japan's threat to Shanghai may cause. The "Yorkshire Post," known as the mouthpiece of Foreign Secretary Eden, recently commented, "Shanghai is an international commercial center, and its fate is at stake. Japanese military officers may, without waiting for the consent of the Tokyo government, impede the main interests of various foreign countries and establish a kind of Monroe Doctrine on the Asian continent to facilitate their plans, or at least occupy a vast area of the city as a bargaining chip." The "Manchester Guardian" stated, "If a Sino-Japanese war breaks out, Japan will threaten Shanghai from the sea in order to weaken China's strength, and European countries will also be unable to rest easy."

<h3>Urgent Issues in Today's Transportation (II)</h3>
<p>— Rui Ling</p>
<p>(IV) Chinese railways, due to the complex historical relationships and different investment backgrounds, each railway regards its rolling stock and mechanical equipment as its own private property. Clear boundaries are drawn with other railways, and there is no willingness to accommodate each other. Sometimes, some railways have soldiers but no goods to transport, while others have goods but no rolling stock. Before the September 18th Incident, the Beining Railway had the most rolling stock due to the many vehicles seized from other railways during the successive entries of the Feng Army into Guanzhong. However, in the end, most of it was given to the enemy! Even until recently, the rolling stock owned by the Beining Railway, in proportion to the length of the line, was still more than that of other railways. However, now it has been given to the enemy again. One of the important reasons for the Iron Ministry's inability to fully dispatch the rolling stock of all railways, resulting in lost opportunities, must be attributed to this. In fact, they are all state-owned railways, all national assets. It only depends on how to use them most effectively and appropriately. Why should we distinguish between what belongs to Railway A and what belongs to Railway B? Even if there are different economic backgrounds, we can find ways to record them separately in accounting. However, dispatching should be centralized and unified, especially now that the situation is urgent. All rolling stock of all railways in the country should be nationalized, and the Iron Ministry should dispatch them centrally, allocating an appropriate number to each railway according to actual needs. The number allocated to each railway can be changed at any time according to the situation. When dispatching, the number of vehicles operating and staying in dangerous areas, such as the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, should be reduced to the minimum to prevent sudden incidents and prevent them from being utilized by the enemy. In the future, all new rolling stock purchased from abroad, regardless of which railway funded the purchase, should be treated as nationally owned and dispatched by the ministry, except for appropriate accounting arrangements.</p>
<p>(V) If war breaks out, and it is a protracted war, we must strive for speed in the military transport to the front and strive for rationality in the circulation of goods in the rear. Therefore, there should be a unified dispatching agency in the front and a system of transportation control should be implemented in the rear. This matter has countless aspects and cannot be described in detail in a separate article. Simply put, in the front, it is most taboo to have multiple orders issued, making it impossible for those who are engaged in the work to know what to do, resulting in chaos. Therefore, there should be a supreme dispatching agency. No army may arbitrarily requisition vehicles without an order from the agency, and no army may arbitrarily transport non-urgent items without the agency's approval. The standard for vehicle capacity should be quickly determined, such as how many infantrymen can sit in each vehicle, how many vehicles are needed for each division, how many cavalrymen and their horses can fit in each vehicle, how many vehicles are needed for each division, how much artillery and its cannons can fit in each vehicle, how many vehicles are needed for each brigade, how the transportation and distribution of supplies should be regulated, and how quickly wounded soldiers should be transported. All of this should have detailed planning and appropriate dispatching. As for the rear, what kind of goods are suitable for water transport, what kind of goods can be transported by road, and what kind of goods must be transported by train? How to reject or reduce the transportation of goods that are not related to military national defense or are not beneficial to the national economy? How to continuously transport daily necessities from various places to prevent panic? How to provide various conveniences for export goods so that they can exchange for foreign funds to increase combat power? The current urgent work is to quickly establish a unified military transportation dispatching agency in the front, and to quickly prepare to implement control measures in the rear based on past goods circulation. Most of China's coal mines are in North China. After the outbreak of war, the fuel problem in major cities should be taken into account as early as possible. It would be best to maintain the original transportation status and continue to supply fuel. Otherwise, where can substitutes be obtained, and how should this new situation be adapted to? This should also be planned in advance, not only for the transportation of fuel, but also for the transportation of other daily necessities.</p>
<p>(VI) Repair materials should be quickly stored in important locations on each railway. In modern warfare, the power of air force destruction is extremely great. For all targets that can be bombed by the air force, repair materials should be prepared to repair and restore traffic at any time. Important bridges especially need this. Therefore, sufficient preparation should be made for the wood and parts for building pontoon bridges, and they should be prepared near each important bridge for emergencies. However, they should still be placed in the safest place to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy or being destroyed by the enemy.</p>
<p>(VII) The Yangtze River and its tributaries are the most important transportation hub in central China and are waterways that are not subject to bombing by enemy planes. Therefore, once war breaks out, we must be able to fully utilize the Yangtze River and its tributaries to maintain our transportation. If we want to be able to fully utilize them, on the one hand, we must ensure the safety of the waterways, and on the other hand, we must have water transport tools. Our navy is too weak, and we have no room for activity along the coast. In the future, coastal transportation can only rely on foreign merchant ships. However, we must take responsibility for the transportation of the Yangtze River waterway ourselves. We should, at the appropriate time, move all the ships that can be transferred to the Yangtze River to the Yangtze River, both merchant ships and warships. The active role is to take on the responsibility of inland river water transportation during wartime, and the passive role is to avoid shelling and capture by enemy ships. After the navy is concentrated in the Yangtze River, it can hold the key points of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, preventing enemy ships from entering. If there are still enemy ships that have not withdrawn, they must be disarmed. Only in this way can the safety of the waterways be guaranteed, merchant ships can travel freely except for defense against air raids, and naval warships can also help with transportation when necessary. I feel that we have now reached the time when we should concentrate all our navy and shipping to the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and other inland rivers! Look! Japan has already requisitioned all its domestic merchant ships to transport troops and has ordered Japanese ships operating in China to return home to take on military transportation tasks! Moreover, in addition to this, it has also leased two ships from British merchants to strengthen its transportation capacity! Japanese expatriates are returning to their country in batches! A major war is imminent. Can we still allow our own merchant ships to sail from Shanghai to North China and South China, preparing to be captured by the Japanese navy? Hurry up and concentrate them, disperse them to various parts of the Yangtze River under the protection of the navy, and prepare to take on the important mission of inland river transportation in the future! Therefore, we should temporarily give way to foreign merchant ships for coastal navigation at this critical time. At the very least, we should reduce the number of sailings to a minimum! If we cannot use the Yangtze River as a wartime transportation artery during wartime and fully develop its transportation capacity, then we will be cutting off our own arteries, and how can we hope to operate freely? When the time comes, we should no longer only consider the gains and losses of that time, but should look at the big picture and the long term. I hope the naval authorities will pay attention!</p>

<h3>London Air Defense Drill Achieves Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>Proving Security Can Be Ensured</p>
<p>[London] Air defense drills were conducted on the night of the 9th of this month over the urban and northeastern suburbs of this city. Both the attacking and defending sides each used 200 bombers and fighter planes. It is now known that the results of the exercise are quite encouraging, meaning that London is one of the most difficult cities in the world to attack from the air. According to expert calculations, during the exercise, approximately 80% of the attacking planes were intercepted by the defending forces and unable to carry out their attacks, which serves as clear proof. The experts also stated that British Air Force pilots are accustomed to the country's climate and can fly regardless of the weather, while foreign Air Force pilots cannot. This is another factor ensuring the safety of the British mainland in the air. (Havas dispatch, 13th, via the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Tianjin-Pukou Front Line</h3>
<p>Over Two Hundred Japanese Cavalrymen Defeated by Our Forces; Japanese Planes Dropped Over Ten Bombs on Machang</p>
<p>According to local communications from Jinan, the Japanese army on the Tianjin-Pukou line has repeatedly advanced south in recent days, but has been bravely repelled by our forces. Therefore, the positions of both sides have not changed. As of the morning of the 11th, our army was firmly defending the south side of the destroyed railway bridge north of Jinghai and the west side of the Grand Canal, while the Japanese army was concentrated in Duliu and on the east bank of the Grand Canal, also laying landmines on the main road north of Jinghai. After 10:00 AM, the Japanese army suddenly launched artillery fire on our army's position, firing intermittently, each time with more than ten shots. After 1:00 PM, over 200 Japanese cavalrymen suddenly charged towards Wulipu, about five li north of our Jinghai position, under the cover of artillery fire. They were surrounded by our army on three sides, and a fierce battle ensued. Our side immediately increased the deployment of a certain unit to participate in the battle, while launching a flanking attack on Yangliuqing from the left flank. The Japanese army was unable to withstand it, and its cavalry retreated north in a disorganized manner at 10:00 PM on the 11th. At 11:40 PM, the Jinghai Chen position was completely under our army's control and is now advancing forward. According to reports from Tangguantun, there has been no artillery fire from the Japanese side since late in the night of the 11th.

<h3>Efforts by Consuls-General of Various Countries in Shanghai to Mediate Peace Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>We Will Respect and Protect Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Consuls-General of Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries in Shanghai made a final effort to mediate peace in a private capacity. However, the Japanese side was determined to invade and showed no sincerity, so the efforts of the consuls were unsuccessful. The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, seeing that peace was hopeless, are extremely concerned about the security of the concessions. It is reported that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was deployed the night before last, and the armored vehicles of the French Concession have also been deployed. At the same time, the detectives have all put on steel helmets and are on strict alert. According to a spokesman for our military authorities, the responsibility for the outbreak of the Shanghai war rests entirely with the Japanese side, which has long been recognized by people of all countries. Our side will respect and protect the lives and property of foreign nationals in the concessions, but we deeply hope that the concession authorities will not provide the aggressors with various conveniences through the concessions.</p>

Chen Guangfu, Li Fuxun, Xu Xinliu, Wang Zhixin, Wang Boyuan, Qin Runqing, Du Yuesheng, Song Ziliang, Pan Jiufen, Ye Fuxiao, Wu Yunqi, Zhu Runsheng, and Lu Zidong attended. Chen Guangfu presided over the meeting, and Secretary Gu Chengan recorded the minutes. The chairman first reported on the meeting convened by the Vice Minister of Finance with the silver and banking industries, and read out the Ministry's order to close for two days. Discussions then began, and decisions were made on matters such as exchange rates. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Visit Xu for Instructions</p>
<p>The Banking Association dispatched Chen Guangfu, Du Yuesheng, Song Ziliang, and others, and the Money Industry Association dispatched Qin Runxiang, Shao Yanshan, and others to visit Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan this morning to request instructions on measures to stabilize wartime finance in the silver and banking industries. Once approved, they will be announced to the public. Reporters from the New Sound Agency learned from the two industries yesterday that the measures to stabilize wartime finance are said to include limiting foreign exchange transactions, extracting living expenses, and concrete measures for using exchange rates in the market.</p>
<p>Investigate Inventory</p>
<p>In order to understand the inventory of various banks and money shops, the Ministry of Finance has dispatched Dai Mingli, Director of the Coinage Department, to notify the chairmen of the silver and banking associations, Chen Guangfu and Shao Yanshan, that personnel will be sent by the Ministry to investigate the inventory of various banks and shops starting today for several days. All banks and shops have been ordered to prepare in advance.</p>
<p>Business as Usual for Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Foreign merchant banks, including HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, Chartered Bank, New Sassoon, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, etc., are operating as usual. Japanese merchant banks, including Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui, Taiwan Bank, Korean Bank, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, etc., are also operating as usual.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Premium</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai banking industry, due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram order to suspend operations for two days in preparation for wartime finance, only had spot exchange trading. The premium futures market was also suspended. However, a certain bank sold 700 taels of the existing premium, with a price of 1,185 yuan, which was distributed equally among the 13 members of the Yinlou Bangda Tongxing. According to sources close to a certain bank, the maintenance of the spot exchange will not be stopped, and 700 taels will be supplied daily for regulation. However, it is carefully stated that silver shops must not change the jewelry gold price. (Calculated according to the current premium of 1,185 yuan, the 烚赤 should be around 1,290 yuan.) It has been found that a batch of current premiums was traded on August 4, with a price of 1,330 yuan, a discount of 145 yuan. Public debt is only a small touch of 96 debts, also about 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>French Concession Notice to Residents for Peaceful Business</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, in view of the second outbreak of war in Shanghai, and with the need to make meticulous arrangements for security within the concession, convened a meeting of key personnel from various departments last night. It is reported that the result of the discussion was that, in addition to strictly adhering to a neutral stance, a public notice would be issued to reassure residents, and to encourage them to continue their livelihoods and maintain peace and tranquility within the concession.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin River Blockade, Waterway Traffic Severed</h3>
<p>First, the Huangpu River will be blocked at the 16th Pier section. Five giant ships will be sunk to block the river at Jiangyin.</p>
<p>The waterway traffic at Jiangyin in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was effectively blockaded yesterday. All foreign merchant ships on the Yangtze River have been announced to cease operations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sinking Ships in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>From the 16th Pier Ning Shao Wharf in the southern section of the Huangpu River in this port, our side began preparing to block the river surface on the night of the 16th, in order to prevent enemy warships from approaching Gaochang Temple and other places. A large number of sand barges were detained, and over one hundred were selected to be towed to Wusong for use. Yesterday morning, in front of the 16th Pier Ning Shao Wharf, the detained Daxing Company's Fuxing Wheel, Sanjiang Transportation's Dayun, and the Zhonghua fishing boat were simultaneously sunk into the river. In addition, two 600-ton sand barges were sunk next to the four ships. Furthermore, the detained Zhongxing Wheel, with a load capacity of 4,267 tons and a draft of 21 feet, was abandoned in the Pudong river area for the final blockage of the Huangpu River. Currently, small sampans can barely pass through both sides, but ships and warships can no longer sail into the southern Huangpu River. Three Japanese warships stationed south of Xinkai River immediately fled and anchored elsewhere after our blockade.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Blockade</p>
<p>The implementation of the blockade at Jiangyinkou has completely cut off Yangtze River traffic. Yangtze River ships of various Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Mingxing, Xinming, Wuhu, Wusong, etc., are blocked upstream of Jiangyin and cannot move, all at a loss for what to do. Enemy warships absolutely cannot pass through the Jiangyin river area.</p>
<p>Ships Disappear</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Taikoo Shipping's New Beijing arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo, entering the port at 9:00 AM and departing as usual at 4:00 PM, limited to carrying 500 passengers. The New Ning Shao entered the port at 12:00 PM and departed at 3:00 PM, specifically carrying refugees out of Shanghai. Apart from these two ships, no other ships left the port. Starting today, except for British foreign ships that occasionally sail, Chinese merchant ships have disappeared. Navigation on the entire Suzhou Creek, regardless of civilian or cargo ships, is prohibited, and waterway traffic on both the Yangtze River and inland rivers is completely cut off.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Westerners Jointly Form International Relief Organization</h3>
<p>Bylaws Passed, Standing Committee Elected; First Meeting Held Today</p>

<h3>City's Relief Organizations Mobilized Yesterday</h3>
<p>All relief organizations in this city have been fully mobilized yesterday, concentrating in two locations, one at the Country Hospital and the other at Lake Side Mansion. The entire group departed at 3:00 PM yesterday to serve in the war zone. Various war zone service teams also departed separately to assist the defense forces in constructing defensive works, working together, and singing patriotic songs that resonated in the sky. Various fellow-townsman associations, carrying their respective flags, went to various locations within the concession to receive displaced refugees. The situation on all sides was extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow-Townsman Association Begins Receiving</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Ningbo, since the registration of fellow-townsman relief personnel began, as of yesterday, there were 200 people. In view of the serious situation in Shanghai, a relief meeting was specifically convened at 9:00 AM yesterday. Under the chairmanship of Chen Zhongbi, it was resolved to divide the group into ten teams, with twenty people in each team, and to divide them into various groups responsible for ambulance assistance, reception, information supply, ships, and medicine. The responsible personnel for each group have also been determined as follows: Director Mao Heyuan, Deputy Directors Chen Zhonggao and Chen Yiting, and Secretary General Shen Jiucheng. The first reception center has been established at the Siming Guild Hall on Minkuo Road, and the second reception center has been established at the Dinghai Guild Hall on Pingjili Road, to begin receiving fellow-townsman refugees and to send personnel to care for fellow-townsmen returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Songjiang Fellow-Townsmen Prepare to Mobilize</p>
<p>The Shanghai Songjiang Fellow-Townsman Association convened an emergency meeting of the board of directors yesterday due to the outbreak of an extraordinary incident in Shanghai. It was resolved to fully mobilize to participate in wartime service work, and to find suitable locations as soon as possible to receive and resettle fellow-townsmen seeking refuge.</p>
<p>Jingwu Martial Arts Association Conducts Poison Gas Drill</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jingwu Martial Arts Association, in view of the fact that the national crisis has reached a final juncture and a full-scale war of resistance is about to begin, is actively promoting work during extraordinary times. It has reached an agreement with the city's relief committee to open a wartime relief training class with a quota of 300 people, divided into six classes, with morning and evening sessions. The first and second classes are scheduled to officially begin on the 16th and 17th. In order to publicize common knowledge of poison gas prevention to citizens, a large-scale poison gas drill and first aid knowledge training will be held. Charts and models of poison gas warfare will be displayed publicly, and instructions will be given on the use of gas masks and clothing, as well as detoxification and first aid. Medical knowledge will be taught. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 20th, lasting three days. Starting next week, admission tickets will be issued. At 7:30 PM on the 17th, Mr. Hu Yuzhi will give a public lecture on "The International Situation After the Outbreak of War Between China and Japan." All are welcome to attend. In addition, a wartime military hospital and refugee shelter are being planned. If any sectors wish to contact us, please go to the Special Zone Branch Office of the association on the third floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road, telephone number 93285.</p>
<p>Relief Society Hopes Various Sectors Will Set Up Reception Centers</p>
<p>The relief committee organized by the city's Social Affairs Bureau, the Charity Federation, and the Local Associations has been working very hard since its establishment. Since the situation in this city became serious yesterday, the secretariat has been working with the reception department and has set up reception centers in the First Special District to provide relief to refugees coming to Shanghai. However, there are a particularly large number of people seeking refuge this time, and the existing centers of the association are really difficult to accommodate. If there are benevolent people willing to contribute funds to set up centers to receive refugees, they can contact the reception group of the association at Renji Hall on Dama Road, or Mr. Wang Boyuan at the Local Associations or the China Reclamation Bank on Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Yousheng Troupe Establishes Third Hospital</p>
<p>The Yousheng Travel Troupe Relief Association has established the Third Relief Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross. Yesterday, a fundraising declaration was issued (text omitted for brevity). The fundraising method is divided into regular donations, with monthly donations of a certain amount (from one yuan upwards, the more the better), with six months as a term, and temporary donations. The association will use receipts of one, five, and ten yuan as proof. Each booklet totals fifty yuan. For caution's sake, if the donor loses the receipt, he must compensate for the amount. The titles and amounts of the donors will be published daily in the "Great Shanghai Evening News."

<h3>Songhu Garrison Command Notice Protecting Foreign Nationals</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command issued a notice stating: For the sake of the notice, the current situation is unstable and people's hearts are shaken. However, our government loves peace, and Chairman Chiang has declared this to the world, which is known and seen by all friendly nations. This command is responsible for guarding the territory and protecting the people. All of our people from all walks of life should remain calm, obey the government, and especially protect friendly foreign nationals at all times and in all places. If there are lawless elements who intend to disrupt public order, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with, and no leniency will be shown. You are to abide by this and earnestly implement it. This notice is issued on August 13, 1937, by Commander Yang Hu.</p>
<h3>Foreign Warships Concentrated in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Total of Eight Ships</p>
<p>The Asian US Fleet's Shanghai warship Loncle-Manes has been moved from the US Navy pontoon in the Huangpu River to the vicinity of the Shanghai Power Company in Yangshupu, as the company is a US industry and an important public utility. However, no soldiers have yet landed. The US Navy pontoon is now docked with a US supply ship. In addition, there are two British warships, three French warships, and one Italian warship in the Huangpu River. Another French warship entered the port at 2:05 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Urgently Requests Curbing Profiteering Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Soar to Sixteen Yuan; Various Groups Express Outrage</p>
<p>The City Rice Industry Association announced a few days ago that the city has more than 800,000 piculs of rice in stock, which is sufficient and will absolutely not affect the people's food supply. Unexpectedly, yesterday, due to the serious situation in Shanghai, rice shops raised prices one after another, soaring more than two yuan in one day, with each picul selling for sixteen yuan and several jiao. This is clearly an attempt to manipulate prices for profit, which is extremely hateful. Various groups in the City Chamber of Commerce are very indignant about this and have asked the Rice Industry Association to order all groups to quickly curb this. At the same time, they have also petitioned the municipal government authorities to thoroughly investigate and deal with this, so as not to affect the people's food supply and plunge the livelihoods of ordinary people into despair.</p>
<h3>Wu Ruiyuan Contributes 150,000 to National Salvation</h3>
<p>Type W National Salvation Bonds; An Unprecedented Individual</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Ruiyuan, a prominent Shanghai textile merchant, is known for his generosity. He usually donates a great deal to local public welfare and other undertakings. Now, with the national crisis at hand, the people have launched a national salvation donation to support the government. Individuals and groups are making donations of tens or hundreds of thousands in succession, showing that their patriotic zeal has reached a boiling point. Now, Wu has donated 150,000 yuan of Type W National Salvation Bonds in his individual name, which has been handed over to the China Remittance Bank for collection. Wu can be considered the unprecedented individual in Shanghai's national salvation donations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Issues Statement Maintaining Peace Zone in Concessions</h3>
<p>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Deployed to Patrol; Troops from Various Countries Assist in Sections</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a statement to the public last night. The translation is as follows: "At this extraordinary time, the duty of the Municipal Council is to use all methods within its power to ensure the safety of life and property within its jurisdiction, maintain the public order of the Public Concession, and maintain a good administrative structure. To achieve this goal, and as a necessary part of defense arrangements, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has been mobilized and is being assisted by troops from certain countries to cooperate with the police in maintaining the Public Concession as a peaceful zone where all residents, regardless of nationality, can live and work in peace. All those who care about the public interest are urged to cooperate with the authorities as much as possible, and to gladly endure any inconveniences, and to generally assist in maintaining calm, security, and order."</p>
<p>Chinese Company of the Volunteer Corps Mobilized Urgently</p>
<p>The Chinese Company and Translation Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were urgently mobilized by the headquarters of the corps on the evening of the 12th and immediately assembled at approximately 9:00 PM that evening to await orders. A temporary command post was established at 119 Jiujiang Road, with the company commander, Mr. Chen Shixia, as the commander. It is reported that starting yesterday morning, the Chinese Company has been ordered to guard Tilanqiao Prison, and the translators are responsible for the work of the foreign troops from the United Kingdom and the United States to eliminate the barriers between the military and civilians.</p>
<p>British and American Troops Assist in Defending the Border</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sentries of the Japanese Marine Corps had actually extended south to the Sichuan Road Bridge on Suzhou Creek, posing a clear threat to the concession. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession, since being ordered the night before last, first dispatched infantry, and yesterday morning also dispatched mechanized units. Armored vehicles patrolled Haig Road and Avenue Foch from time to time. Many armored vehicles were also concentrated on the lawn of the Red Church on Jiangxi Road. British troops stationed in Shanghai and US Marines stationed in Shanghai were also dispatched yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to inspect the area west of Shanghai yesterday afternoon and saw British troops piling sandbags and erecting barbed wire in front of the Huxi Railway crossing on Brenan Road and at the end of Jessfield Road, appearing extremely busy. At the same time, a team of American heavy artillery, totaling over one hundred people, was departing on Gordon Road.</p>
<p>Statistics on the Number of Armed Personnel in the Concessions</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the total number of armed personnel in the Shanghai concessions, excluding Japanese soldiers. It is estimated that there are approximately 4,600 personnel protecting the Public Concession and the police force, with over 5,000 reservists, approximately 1,000 in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and approximately 960 British Army, including auxiliary troops. There are also 800 sailors, approximately 1,000 US Army, approximately 150 sailors, approximately 700 Italian Army, and approximately 300 sailors. The French Concession police force totals 2,000 people, and there are fewer than 400 Italian soldiers. If the situation becomes urgent, the British battalion stationed in Hong Kong can arrive in Shanghai within two days. The United States can transfer troops from the Philippines, and France can transfer troops from Vietnam to strengthen the defenses of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Telephones Request Implementation of Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce held a joint emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 PM yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqing, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Luo Qinghua, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Peizhen, Pei Yunqing, Chen Ziming, and over twenty other people attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai first reported that since the Shanghai situation became tense, the Chamber of Commerce, based on the requests of various industry associations, had telephoned the Ministry of Finance to quickly determine financial adjustment and industrial and commercial protection measures, and had invited leaders of the banking and money exchange industries to discuss the matter. Unexpectedly, today, the banks and money exchanges in this city suddenly cited a ministerial order and took a two-day holiday, which is apparently for the sake of preparing for an extraordinary economy during extraordinary times. Should the Chamber of Commerce propose something regarding this matter? It should be discussed. As a result of the discussion by the various committee members present, separate telegrams were sent to the Ministry of Finance and separate letters were sent to the Banking and Money Exchange Associations.</p>
<h3>Charity Groups, Disaster Relief Associations Discuss Methods for Relieving Battlefield Refugees Yesterday</h3>
<p>Request Fellow-Townsman Associations to Take Responsibility for Receiving Separately; Determine the Quantity of Provisions and Handle Unifiedly; Relief Association Sets Up Lost Refugee Inquiry Office; Great World Amusement Park Converted to Receive Refugees</p>
<p>The City Relief Association and the Charity Federation United Disaster Relief Association jointly invited representatives from various fellow-townsman associations, schools, and charity groups to hold their first conversation meeting yesterday. Pan Gongzhan presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of holding the conversation meeting, stating briefly that the war in the city is unavoidable, and in the past two days, refugees fleeing from northern Shanghai, Jianghu, and Wusong have filled the roads and urgently need to be received in order to avoid becoming displaced. Therefore, several requests are made to everyone: ⑴ Fellow-townsman associations are requested to determine the number of refugees they can receive within their capacity. If there are no spare houses to receive them, please determine the number of people they can provide provisions for. Each refugee needs approximately three to four yuan of provisions per month. ⑵ Schools in non-war areas can continue to open, which is the best. If they cannot open, please try to allocate them for use as reception centers. ⑶ Various charity groups are requested to provide as much assistance as possible in carrying out relief work. Subsequently, the representatives present expressed their opinions separately and determined the number of refugees they can receive or provide provisions for, for the association to handle in a unified manner. Also, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Townsman Association held a special committee meeting yesterday to discuss matters related to relieving fellow-townsmen in distress. It was resolved to raise relief donations and try to maintain transportation to send fellow-townsmen back to their hometowns. In addition to setting up a reception center at the Siming Guild Hall, the association plans to add one to three more locations to prevent fellow-townsmen from becoming displaced.</p>
<p>The City Relief Committee has been actively receiving refugees for the past two days, no less than several thousand people. Now the council believes that some refugees' family members may be temporarily separated, which is worse than death, and they are in great pain. Therefore, it has specifically set up a refugee general inquiry office at Renji Shantang on Ernan Road, which will start operating from today. Refugees who have lost family members can request registration at the inquiry office to prepare for recruitment at any time. Refugees from all over the world can directly inquire at the office if they have lost family members. If they are received or registered by the association, they can be claimed. If there are homeless refugees, they can directly contact the Relief Committee and request arrangements for reception and repatriation. Also, people who read the newspapers are requested to provide assistance to refugees along the road who have lost family members and instruct them to come to the inquiry office for inquiries so that families can be reunited and avoid becoming displaced. This is also immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>The Rongji Great World on Eight Immortals Bridge in this city has stopped all dragon entertainment since yesterday due to the outbreak of war in Shanghai and converted it for use as a reception center for wartime refugees.</p>

<h3>A Tour of the Northwest District After the Outbreak of the Shanghai War</h3>
<p>Traffic is Cut Off in the Chinese Concession; Many People are Still Relocating; People's Hearts are Inevitably Floating; Local Order is Very Good</p>
<p>The war in Shanghai, committed by the Japanese invaders, began yesterday morning. The northern and western districts of the Public Concession, close to the war zone, have reached the extreme of unrest. The various trends witnessed are described in detail below, which must be of interest to those who care about the reality in the northern Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps Garrison</p>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps mobilized a portion of its forces at 8:00 PM the night before last to defend the northwest districts. The American troops are responsible for the defense north of Suzhou Creek, garrisoned at the open space at the intersection of Ke Neng Hai Road, the Municipal Council West District Elementary School, and North Henan Road Bazilu, the Nanyang Elementary School on Kaifeng Road, and the Huisi Police Station ball field. It is heard that the Western District defense is the responsibility of the British Scottish troops. In addition to garrisoning in the Western District, troops are stationed at the Gezhi Public School on Beihai Road in the central district and the racecourse on Jingansi Road. The racecourse also has armored vehicles and other heavy weapons parked inside. As for the troops of other nationalities and the Chinese Company, as of now, they have not all been dispatched.</p>
<p>Tight Security</p>
<p>The areas where the Northern District borders the Chinese territory, such as the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu, the northern side, the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu, the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road, the intersection of North Shanxi Road and Jielu, the intersection of Ke Neng Hai Road and Jielu, the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Jielu, the intersection of Aierjin Road and North Zhejiang Road, the intersection of Haining Road and Kaifeng Road, as well as the intersections of Xinjiang Road, Rehe Road, Alabai Sitou Road, and the North Xizang Road Bridge, and the iron gates at the Xinzha Bridge, Niaozhen Road Bridge, and Sampan Factory New Bridge to the west of the bridge, have not been opened all day yesterday. In addition, the alleys directly adjacent to the Chinese territory, such as Gongyi Li, Huatongfang, and Huaxingfang, which have not been equipped with iron gates, are all separated by barbed wire. Therefore, traffic between the concession and Zhabei was completely blocked yesterday. The reporter attempted to go to Zhabei for inspection by car twice, at 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, but despite repeatedly detouring, was unable to reach it. It really felt like being close yet far away. Finally, it was planned to exit Zhongshan Road via Brinan Road, and it was fortunate to pass through the iron gate there, but was stopped by the police on duty on Zhongshan Road, who said that there was already contact ahead, and had to quietly retreat. In addition to the Chinese and Western police posted at each iron gate, a small team of approximately ten Volunteer Corps members armed with guns was added to each location for garrison, making the situation quite serious. The two artillery positions in the middle of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road and in the middle of Bazilu and North Jiangxi Road had Volunteer Corps members stationed inside them yesterday morning, and there were even more people defending inside and outside the square bunker at the North Xizang Road Bridge. The patrol teams of search police and Volunteer Corps members were patrolling back and forth on various roads along the border, so although people's hearts are inevitably floating, local order is very good. However, the Hongkou and Diswei Road police stations are taking extremely strict precautions due to the location of their regions, and the gate controls are very tight. Chinese and Western investigators must wear uniforms for duty at night.</p>
<p>Relocation Still Flourishing</p>
<p>Yesterday, those who moved south of Suzhou Creek were all from the Hongkou area. The vehicles transporting boxes and cages along the way did not stop from morning to night. Although the residents of Zhabei who had not moved out yesterday wanted to escape the dangerous area, it was extremely difficult to fly over because the concession had been blocked. However, the parents were unwilling to sit idly by and get stuck inside, so they hired boats from the waterways at the west end of Suzhou Creek to cross the river. Therefore, the river banks at Xinzha Bridge and Sampan Factory New Bridge were crowded from morning to dusk. The police station in charge specifically dispatched experienced search police to maintain order on the south bank.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Hongkou</p>
<p>The area north of Haining Road on North Sichuan Road has entered a state of war. Shops are completely closed, and pedestrians going north only reach the intersection of Bazilu. Trams of the first and second class also turn around there, so there are more Volunteer Corps search police stationed there. Since the contact on the front line, citizens have been standing there, watching the Japanese troops coming and going by car, one after another. The areas of East Haining Road, Wusong Road, Minhang Road, and Youheng Road were originally where Japanese expatriates gathered. Yesterday, very few Chinese passed through those places. On both sides of the road, only young Japanese expatriates were wandering back and forth in groups of three or five. It is said that these people are actually plainclothes troops composed of Japanese veterans.</p>
<p>Court Preparation</p>
<p>The First Special District Local Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, since they are located adjacent to Zhabei, should be prepared to ensure safety and prevent emergencies during this time of war. They have already leased the former site of the Tongyi Trust Company on Beijing Road and have first moved important items to that location. Yesterday, they also hired craftsmen to engage in decoration inside the house. If difficulties in office occur, they will move at any time.</p>
<h3>High Ah Mao and Other Repeat Offenders in Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>The Case of Young Jiang’s Brother: Four Accomplices Released, Remaining Bandits to Intercept the Baohua Steamer</p>
<p>Regarding the case of six-year-old Jiang’s younger brother from Chenmu Town outside Suzhou’s Xumen, who was lured to Shanghai last month on the 14th by bandits and hidden in the French Concession, after which the Hongkou Police arrested the ringleader, Gao Ah Mao from Suzhou, and fifteen others involved in the kidnapping. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. This morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the Third Criminal Court for investigation. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police force stated that after further investigation, suspects Zhou Xiaoyue, Zhu Azong, Dai Xiaodi, and Jin Genrong, four individuals were found to be uninvolved and requested their release, which the court granted. The kidnapped victim, Jiang’s younger brother, is actually named Yu Genfu. His grandmother, Yu Zhang, is present in court to testify that her residence is in Zhuanggang Village outside Suzhou’s Xumen. When Yu was kidnapped, Gao Ah Mao, along with the other defendants, used weapons to first rob 80 yuan in legal tender before kidnapping her grandson, Yu Genfu, and fleeing. Initially, they demanded a ransom of 1,000 yuan. Later, Yu Zhang paid the gang 500 yuan. The ringleader, Gao Ah Mao, lives in</p>
<p>Hujiawan, Chenmu Town, outside Suzhou City, and is a boatman. During the investigation, police detectives, acting on a warrant from the court, went to Suzhou in collaboration with the local police. They secretly searched his home and found two long-barreled rifles, a Spanish-made .32 caliber handgun with the number 229, a cloth bag containing thirty-one gunpowder bullets for the rifle, five flashlights, and two police whistles. It was discovered that the handgun was used during the pirate robbery of the Baohua Steamer at Wusongkou in November of last year, when a passenger was shot and killed; the bullets were fired from that handgun. It was found that Gao Ah Mao and his gang specialized in kidnapping for ransom in the interior and had committed</p>
<p>two other kidnapping cases: ⑴ the victim was killed because the family could not afford the ransom; ⑵ a ransom of 1,500 yuan was obtained. Among the defendants, Gao Xiangsheng and Li Chenshi denied involvement in this case during the police investigation, so their cases were postponed for further investigation. The others all confessed, stating that they were invited by a fugitive named A Jin Tu. The grandmother of the child, Yu Zhang, was force-fed feces and had two pieces of flesh cut from her breasts because she initially refused to pay the ransom. The gang's methods were extremely cruel. The guns and other items found at Gao Ah Mao's home were presented as evidence. After Judge Zhong questioned the defendants, all were remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>New Hurricane Reaches Fujian and Zhejiang Waters</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Observatory's report yesterday morning, a new hurricane in the Pacific Ocean was heading north-northwest. The center was sixty nautical miles away, located at 16 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees 40 minutes east longitude, approximately in the waters between Fujian and Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>Small Plane Lands in Racecourse</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:40 PM, a red small training plane landed on the polo field inside the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse. Unfortunately, during the landing, due to a moment of carelessness, the propeller struck the ground and broke, and the right wing immediately hit the ground and collapsed. Both wheels were also damaged. The pilots were two foreigners, but it could not be determined whether they were British or American. It was reported that the two foreigners were associated with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Fortunately, the impact upon landing was very weak, so they were not injured.</p>
<h3>Ferry Sailor Hit by Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>Ding Miaoxiang, a 21-year-old sailor on a municipal ferry, was working on the boat around 4:00 PM yesterday when a stray bullet suddenly flew towards him as the ferry approached the Qiujiang Wharf. The bullet struck Ding Miaoxiang in the head and exited, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by the ship's officers. It is reported that his injuries are severe and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Auto Drivers' Union Forms Traffic Service Corps</h3>
<p>Due to the extraordinary tense situation, the Municipal Automobile Drivers' Union held an emergency meeting yesterday (the 13th). In addition to all the directors, more than one hundred drivers from various companies attended. Everyone was extremely enthusiastic about resisting the war. First, Chairman Du Weichang reported the purpose of the meeting and described the current critical situation in Shanghai. All attendees were enraged and ready for action. A traffic service corps was then formed, with the following organizational structure: ⑴ Liu Zhigang was appointed as the corps commander, and Wang Jiaan, Zhang Liansheng, and Zhao Youcai as deputy commanders to lead the corps members to serve at the front lines; ⑵ Zhu Weichang was appointed as the director of the corps' rear defense office; ⑶ recruitment of corps members was expanded; ⑷ corps members' wages would be one to two yuan per day, based on skill level. At that time, over one hundred people had already registered. It is reported that the matter has been reported to the Municipal Police Bureau, awaiting orders to depart. The people's enthusiasm for fighting the enemy together is evident.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association's 17th Lottery Drawing</h3>
<p>To Be Held on the 16th at the Pudong Native Association on Avenue Edward VII</p>
<p>The Central Savings Association has been established for just over a year, and its business has been exceptionally prosperous, with over one hundred thousand account holders and special prize money exceeding twenty-five thousand yuan. Because the original location on Hankou Road is no longer sufficient for office space, the Association has purchased a building at the corner of Tianjin Road and Jiangxi Road (the former site of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Bank) and will relocate its business there, effective immediately. A branch office will also be established at 609 Avenue Joffre to allow citizens residing in the southwestern district to conveniently join the Association and make payments. Furthermore, this period's lottery drawing will be changed to the Pudong Native Association on Avenue Edward VII and will be held publicly. Because the 15th falls on a Sunday, the drawing will be changed to Monday, the 16th, at 2:00 PM. This Saturday (the 14th) and Sunday (the 15th), both the new location on Tianjin Road and the branch office on Avenue Joffre will be open all day as usual.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Wu Longji's representative, I have read the article titled "Local News: Ten Japanese Warships Sailed Out Yesterday" on page 9 of the third section of the 13th of this month's Shen Bao, which stated, "Foreman Wu Longji supervised laborers in storing 600 cases of poisonous gas bombs loaded from (Japanese) ships in the Huishan Wharf warehouse late at night." I was shocked by this false report. After investigating the matter, it has been found that I, Wu Longji, have been in the transportation business in Shanghai for more than thirty years, dealing exclusively with Chinese merchants. I have never done business with Japanese merchants. Although I have not received a high level of education, my love for my country is no less than that of others. During this time of national crisis, I would never do anything so outrageous. In addition to pursuing legal action, I am publishing this statement in the newspaper to clarify the truth. Therefore, I request that your esteemed lawyer send a letter to your newspaper to correct this false report in order to prevent malicious individuals from spreading rumors and harming legitimate merchants, causing patriots to be wrongly accused. I hope you will investigate and take appropriate action. Respectfully, to the Editor of the Local News section of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Lawyer Qiu Hanping, August 13, the 26th year.</p>

<h3>Elementary Thoughts on Air Defense</h3>
<p>Since the advent of air forces, warfare has changed from a planar one to a three-dimensional one. That is to say, even if the defensive positions of the front lines are very strong, enemy planes can fly to important locations in the rear and carry out bombings, destroying our political centers, economic centers, damaging our factories, and destroying our transportation, causing serious damage to our spirits and material resources. Therefore, there is now a slogan that says, "Without air defense, there is no national defense." This is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, air defense can be divided into two types: active and passive. Active air defense is the responsibility of the military, while passive air defense requires all of our people to take on this responsibility together.</p>
<p>What is passive air defense? It means devising various methods to reduce damage when enemy planes come to bomb us. To be able to undertake this task, of course, one should receive very strict training. However, if a few common sense measures are taken, much of the damage can be reduced. I will write them down below.</p>
<p>1.  Light Control</p>
<p>If we have active air defense, enemy planes, in order to accomplish their missions, mostly attack at night. At that time, it is dark, and the lights of the city are their best compasses. Therefore, we should turn off all unnecessary lights early. Necessary lights should also be covered so that their light does not leak out. At the same time, the flames from chimneys and the light from iron smelting should all be covered. You should know that not concealing the light of one lamp can make the light control of the whole area ineffective. The most important thing to cover is the windows, using three layers of thick black cloth. The electric lights inside the room should also be wrapped on all sides with black cloth more than a foot long, so that the light can only shine downwards and not leak out. Moving lights, such as car lights, should be made into sleeves with metal products, and bicycle lights can be completely wrapped in black cloth. In short, no light should be visible to the planes.</p>
<p>2.  Firefighting</p>
<p>Using incendiary bombs to start fires is a vicious method of attacking cities by planes. If they are not extinguished immediately, major damage will be sustained. Of course, the fire department is relied upon to extinguish fires that occur at ordinary times, but if there are many places on fire, the fire department will be unable to attend to all of them. Therefore, everyone should move away things that are easily ignited in their homes. If you are unlucky enough to be hit by an incendiary bomb, you should extinguish it immediately before it causes a disaster. But you should be aware that incendiary bombs cannot be extinguished with water. Therefore, each family should prepare at least two loads of yellow sand and an iron shovel. When an incendiary bomb falls, use the shovel to pour the sand down on it. This is the best method of firefighting. At the same time, one or two people in each family should stay behind to be responsible for firefighting in their home. If a fire breaks out in a neighbor's house, you should also help as much as possible. If you cannot extinguish the fire, notify the fire department in a calm and quick manner.</p>
<p>3.  First Aid</p>
<p>If you are injured or poisoned, of course you should ask a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. Before being sent to the hospital, it is best to disinfect the wound. If there is bleeding, you should also try to stop it. Speaking of the causes of bleeding, there are three types. One is a ruptured artery, in which the blood flows out very forcefully and is bright red. The second is a ruptured vein, in which the blood also flows out a lot, but it is more gradual and the blood is purple. This type of bleeding is very dangerous, because excessive bleeding can make it impossible to save the person. The third type is capillary bleeding, which is slow oozing. This type of bleeding is considered very minor. The method of stopping bleeding should be to first determine what type of bleeding it is. If it is arterial bleeding, then the fingers should be used to press down on the artery near the heart until no pulsing is felt -- for example, if there is bleeding in the calf, you should always press on the part of the leg near the knee. If it is venous bleeding, then it should be reversed, flattening the vein at the distal end. For capillary bleeding, use a disinfected object to press on the wound. After a short time, it can be stopped. Flattening the blood vessel requires greater force. After the bleeding is stopped, immediately tie it tightly with a tourniquet or bandage and send it to the hospital for treatment. What should be noted is that the blood vessel cannot be tied for more than two hours. Over a long period of time, the local area often becomes necrotic. The most common method of disinfection is to drip hydrogen peroxide into the wound, then gently wipe it clean with boric acid cotton wool, and then apply diluted iodine to the wound. After disinfection and hemostasis, it should be sent to the hospital immediately. If there are not enough stretchers, then a short ladder can be laid with cotton padding. There are many ways to make temporary stretchers, such as rattan mats and palm cushions. When carrying, be steady and quick, and avoid shocks as much as possible.</p>
<p>4.  Air Raid Warnings</p>
<p>Air raid warnings are signals to notify the people of what preparations to make. First, all sounds should be controlled to avoid misunderstandings. Second, everyone should be familiar with the various signals so as not to make mistakes. The symbols of the warnings are listed below.</p>
<p>Air Raid Warnings:</p>
<p>The air raid warning is sounded when enemy planes are approaching.</p>
<p>1.  Electric (steam) whistle: "Ooo-ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo..." ------------------</p>
<p>After sounding a long tone for twenty seconds, sound two short tones (three seconds in total) and then stop for two seconds, repeating this six times.</p>
<p>2.  Bell: ⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙ Dang, strike once, then strike twice, Dang, Dang, for three minutes.</p>
<p>An emergency warning is sounded when enemy planes are approaching closely.</p>
<p>1.  Electric (steam) whistle, Ooo-ooo, ooo, ooo ... ------------------......................................</p>
<p>Sounding a long tone for 30 seconds, followed by short tones several times for about a minute.</p>
<p>2.  Alarm, -⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-⊙-Dang, Dang, Dang... strike rapidly and continuously for two minutes.</p>
<p>The all-clear is sounded when enemy planes have left.</p>
<p>1.  Electric (steam) whistle, Ooo----- continue to make a long sound for two minutes (once)</p>
<p>2.  Alarm, ⊙⊙⊙⊙⊙... Dangdangdangdangdang... Like this, strike separately one by one for two minutes.</p>
<p>There are two additional types of alerts that require special attention.</p>
<p>Poison Gas Alarm:</p>
<p>1.  Drumming (or knocking on a kerosene can) Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong...</p>
<p>⊙ - ○ - ○ - ○ - ○ - ○ ...</p>
<p>Clatter, dong, dong, striking the drum three times, pausing briefly, then striking once again, continuing like this for two minutes.</p>
<p>2.  Flag Markings: During the day, the place where a yellow flag is inserted, or the place where a red light is lit at night, indicates an area contaminated by poison gas.</p>
<p>Fire Alarm:</p>
<p>Striking a gong randomly for two minutes. 5. Guarding</p>
<p>Generally speaking, guarding should be the responsibility of the military and police. However, in wartime, the military and police all go to the front to resist the enemy. So the responsibility for self-defense falls on the people themselves. Therefore, in peacetime, people should organize themselves, intensify training, and fully study military knowledge in order to complete their tasks.</p>
<p>6.  Poison Gas Protection</p>
<p>Poison gas is indeed a terrible thing, but if defended properly, it is not without a solution. Under the current conditions, it is impossible for everyone to have a gas mask and protective clothing as a practical matter. Simpler methods should be used more often, such as dissolving one or two ounces of sodium carbonate, four ounces of sodium hyposulfite, and one ounce of glycerin in a basin of hot water, soaking gauze wrapped in cotton wool in the solution, wringing it slightly, and covering the mouth and nose with it. This can also achieve the effect of protecting against poison gas. In very urgent situations, a wet towel or a towel soaked in urine can be used to temporarily prevent it. What should be noted is that when encountering poison gas, you should walk against the wind, not with the wind. As for digging air raid shelters and setting up poison gas-proof rooms, these are effective methods of collective poison gas protection. A poison gas-proof room is a room that is isolated from the outdoor air. The entrances and exits are separated by two thick curtains. Inside there are food and disinfectants. If there are many people in the room, there should also be equipment to supply fresh air.</p>
<p>7.  Traffic Control</p>
<p>Deaths and injuries from trampling each other are often greater than injuries from bombing. Therefore, traffic control is needed to maintain order and control all vehicles, so that people can evacuate easily and not hinder or harm protection work.</p>
<p>8.  Evacuation</p>
<p>The elderly, weak, women, and children should retreat to safer places during air raids. Those responsible for evacuation work should guide the people to the evacuation sites and routes and maintain order in the evacuation shelters. The best place to evacuate is, of course, the basement. If there is no basement, then you have to evacuate to an open space, or a designated school or public place. If the enemy releases poison gas, do not go to the woods, because the poison gas does not dissipate easily in those places. When going to the evacuation site, you must walk in order, do not rush ahead, and do not panic. You must understand that panic is useless, and the result of rushing ahead is to cause trampling.</p>
<p>The eight points above are all things that are easy to do. As long as we have a firm awareness and a spirit of hard work, we can definitely greatly reduce the damage from air raids. This is what we should encourage each other to do. At the same time, Shanghai is the first line of national defense. Once there is an international war, this city will bear the brunt. Therefore, we should actively prepare. Currently, there is a protection corps organization in this city that is recruiting brave members to organize training and prepare to take on the task of protection for the people. The people should enthusiastically participate.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the area around Shandong was clear to cloudy, with winds from the south to east. The wind direction in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River was uncertain. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River were cloudy with torrential rain and strong east to north winds. There were typhoons and rain in Manna Island, the East China Sea, and Taipei, due to the typhoon moving north or northwest. The center of the hurricane reached within sixty miles of 27 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday. The wind force was fierce. Furthermore, the highest temperature in Shanghai within 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 90.5 degrees, and the lowest was 76.6 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 93.9 degrees, and the lowest was 79.2 degrees.</p>
<h3>Descendants of the Motherland</h3>
<p>— Ma Jia</p>
<p>I remember that five months ago, the five consecutive Shikumen houses next to my house were all rented out, and a lot of machinery was moved in. A short guy with narrow eyes, but with eyeballs as sharp as a rat's, watched others moving this way and that way. He used a crude Jiangbei accent to order people to move things. I walked into the house and said to my wife:</p>
<p>"Oh dear! The house next door has been rented by the Japanese! And it's a factory, which is really troublesome!"</p>
<p>My wife frowned. We didn't dare to be "friendly neighbors" with the Japanese because, first, there had been trouble with Japanese neighbors, and second, my younger brother, because of the patriotic education he received at school, sang the "March of the Volunteers" or "Fight Back to Our Old Home" every day when he came home from school. And, in his simple mind, because he was receiving strong enemy education, he often gritted his teeth and cursed the Japanese. This made us worry a lot. When my younger brother came home from school, our whole family had persuaded him to be polite to our "neighbors" and not to cause any trouble that couldn't be cleaned up.</p>
<p>My younger brother was obedient and didn't provoke the children next door. He always went home when he saw them. The short, thin guy's wife was tall and fat, and didn't have any Japanese air about her. Our whole family was a little baffled by them.</p>
<p>But one day, the short guy came to my house and said to me in his crude Jiangbei accent:</p>
<p>"Sir! Could you lend me an abacus?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" I lent him the abacus.</p>
<p>After a while, he politely returned it to me. From then on, he often nodded to me when he saw me, and I, of course, smiled at him politely. His big, fat wife couldn't speak much Chinese, and his children could only speak Japanese. But they liked to play with the Chinese children in the alley, and the Chinese children always played with them in a mocking tone, constantly calling them: "Japanese kids! Japanese kids!"</p>
<p>Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, I have become even more cautious about that "neighbor." It's not that I'm afraid of them, but I'm afraid that even the smallest thing like a fly might be used by their government to extort a lot of money. One night, I was enjoying the cool air at the door. The short guy took a Japanese newspaper and walked up to me, saying:</p>
<p>"Sir! Sir! Chiang Kai-shek is going to send troops! Ah, ah!"</p>
<p>I saw that his face was full of happy smiles. I was very surprised, and my nerves made me feel that he was planning some trick on me. However, I politely moved a stool over and let him sit down. So I started talking to him.</p>
<p>I had never had such a "sincere talk" with him before. This conversation made me realize that he was not Japanese, he was Chinese. But he had lived in Japan for fifteen years. When he went to Japan, he was only about ten years old. Now, his boss (who is Japanese) has opened a small factory here. Because he is very loyal, they asked him to support them here. He has a monthly salary of eighty yuan. His wife is also Chinese (from Jiangbei). The children were born in Japan, so they can only speak Japanese, but his wife can't speak good Chinese, so she doesn't speak often.</p>
<p>I asked him why he could still speak Chinese. He said very seriously: "Chinese people will not forget Chinese!" I took the opportunity to ask him: "Then will you forget China?" His expression became even more serious, and he said, "How could I forget China?" He also told me that on the day Fengtai was recovered, he didn't know why, but he felt unspeakable happiness in his heart.</p>
<p>But his concepts were very vague because he had been heavily drugged. He said that China must merge with Japan, otherwise, it would be difficult for everyone to "do business." And he still believed that the four northeastern provinces were not in the hands of the Japanese because there was a "Xuantong Emperor" sitting on the dragon throne. I asked him again: "Since there is a Xuantong Emperor over there, why does Japan want to send troops over there?" I asked him again: "Why are Japanese soldiers fighting in North China? Isn't he trying to annex our China?" He listened to me and nodded repeatedly, saying, "Yes! Yes!" Finally, he said, "I didn't think about it properly in the past."</p>
<p>Later, he asked me to show him Chinese newspapers, but he didn't know many Chinese characters. I told him that we Chinese, whether government or people, are united and preparing for war. So he got excited, jumped up and asked, "Really?" I said to him, "I won't lie to you." At the same time, I asked him, "If China and Japan fight, who will you help?" He said without hesitation: "Of course I will be with the Chinese to fight the Japanese!"</p>
<p>He has been in Japan for fifteen years, but Chinese blood still flows in his veins! Ah! Descendants of the motherland, you will not forget the blood and soil of your ancestors! I was so moved that I shook his hand. In the past, I had doubts about him. Now, we are holding hands like brothers. (Author's note: Readers, don't treat this as an article. It is a true fact!)</p>
<h3>Defending the Marco Polo Bridge (6)</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen He</p>
<p>While everyone was discussing this, someone was shouting on the bridgehead again. Everyone focused their attention on one side, and saw Ding Datou walking crookedly. His face was covered in blood, and his hands were also bloody. He muttered, "You hit, you hit... you hit! Anyway, it's over! It's over."</p>
<p>Li Wu: "Datou, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang: "Was he beaten by the Japanese devils?"</p>
<p>Ding Datou seemed to have lost consciousness, waving his hands wildly in the air: "Japanese devils! Japanese devils! I... I'm not afraid of you... Give me the broadsword, I'll chop... you bunch of bastards..."</p>
<p>Ding Datou's two mu of soybeans were on the road. Naturally, they were ruined by the Japanese devils. Everyone looked at his crazy and manic behavior, so they pressed him down, calmed him down, and first sobered him up.</p>
<p>Li Wu: "How are we going to live?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang then said: "Only if everyone rises up and drives them away - drives them out of our Chinese territory - then we can have peaceful days."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Mr. Wang clenched his fist: "As long as everyone is united, whether it's workers, farmers, or soldiers, let's all unite!"</p>
