<p>仍申國闕、同時宛平我駐軍及專員公署亦來電話報告、謂有大隊日軍正將縣城包圍、竊斷交通、我為免意外、已將四門緊閉、盼速交涉等語、當局電與松井洽商、經决定雙方派員前往攔阻、以免衝突、松井派其副特務員團長寺平大尉及伞田口駐平第一聯隊長、我派外交委會參議林齊宇、交委會議員周永業等馳往、詎寺平到後、仍主日軍非入不可、正爭辯中、東門外忽槍聲大起、西門外亦發現砲聲及槍聲、我駐軍至此、迫不得已、簡略予抵抗、惟並未出城、士兵傷亡甚衆、現渾河岸森林內有日軍約近五百餘名、取臥倒預備放式、情形臻嚴重、日方要求將永定河岸騎兵撤退、我駐在該方均屬步兵、並無騎兵、顯係經理要求、我决本鎭靜對處、倘日方仍肆經理壓迫、則我忍無可忍、當本公理、决不退讓、又宛平駐軍並無砲兵、其砲聲何自、不問自明、設因此發生意外、一切責任、應由日方負之、（八日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］蘆溝橋在廣安門外西南二十里、為平西名勝之一、扼平漢交通孔繼、其東豐台、又為平漢北寧兩路接軌處、四年以前、宛平縣始移洽蘆溝橋、縣府在橋西、城頭不甚大、但尚堅固、自去年日本在華北增兵後、迭在豐台建兵營轅出道而謀在蘆溝橋作同樣設備、縣長兼專員王冷齊、周旋應付、煞費苦心、卒獲保持土地之完整、認為日方所痛恨、此為事件之遠因、最近又以此間當局久滯梓鄕、交涉失其對象、而國大代表擬奉遵令進行、後予以多少刺激、乃欲造成恐怖局面、以達壓迫當局返平之目的、此為事件之近因、邇來日軍頻頻在蘆演習、且皆實彈露營、人民已司空見慣、但至七日夜間、人數忽增、至八日晨三時二十分左右、忽敎閔成為散兵綫以宛平縣城為目標、向西急進、至距離約百米時、竟發砲鳴槍、衝鋒前邇於是事件之衝突、遂開始矣、記者於八日晨曾一度赴當地視覺、因該縣城四門緊閉、東南城角且有日兵甚多、故無法入城、據探悉、當日軍向我進攻時、我方初猶疑係日軍演習、及見其愈迫愈近、有意搗衆、始知係欲搶奪縣城、當卽起而應付、為正當防衛計、予以遠離、因縣城舊小、茍不抵抗、卽將不保也、日方見我抵抗、更以小鋼砲小過山砲轟擊、其目標在奪取蘆溝石橋、進取縣城、自八日晨三時半起、至八日晨七時五十分、槍砲聲不停、我方死者約六七十人、附近大井村一農民、且無辜被日軍斬首、日軍方面據傳死准尉一人、一少尉負傷、自八時以至十一時、為雙方接洽調停之時間、十一時我方以日方所提先撤兵條件、不能接受、日方乃又開始攻擊、至十二時始復停止、直至下午六時、雙方尚在對峙中、此關於日軍向我軍挑釁之經過也、至於我當局態度、固希望和平解决、但决不能接受日方先撤兵之條件、故交涉雖在進行、有無結果、則未可知、惟民衆憤慨、士氣旺盛、守軍咸抱與縣城共存亡之决心、北平市內人心亦極鎭靜、雖八日晚八時卽宣告戒戰、但道路行人絕無張皇驚慌之色、董平津民衆已習於此等生活矣、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>兩軍衝突經過别報</p>
<p>［北平］中日兩軍自今晨四時卅分起互起衝突、戰至九時卅分乃“休戰”、至十一時後、復曾發生短戰一次、但今日下午未續起衝突、日軍死傷者十餘人、死者中有軍官一人、下士兩人、傷者中有副中尉一人、最初事變發生於昨晚、當時有日兵一中隊、在蘆溝橋附近演習戰鬥、不意與華兵互起衝突、據日方聲稱、日兵初聞手槍之聲數響、料係駐龍主廟之華兵而發者、北平日軍事當局乃要求許日兵入宛平城搜查開槍者、而經華方拒絕、於是日援軍卽由豐台馳往、開始包圍宛平城、今日侵晨、中日軍民當局代表五人、（華方三人日方兩人）由北平同赴宛平、澈查此案、惟在會商之中、蘆溝橋附近頓起戰事、至九時卅分始已、華軍受損甚巨、日軍曾否認砲轟宛平、惟華軍則稱、確有砲彈落於城中、致喪失生命毀及財產云、戰事終止後、有日飛機在天空擲下傳單、要求華軍撤退、惟華軍置之不理、準備扼守平漢路綫、故至上午十一時、戰事復作、但僅歷數分鐘卽已、駐平日武官今井少佐宣稱、華軍除於昨晚射擊日軍外、今晨復首先開槍、日軍遂不得不予報復、中國當局則稱、當解决最初爭案之談判、正在進行之際、日軍忽向華軍開槍、華軍至萬不得已時始開槍回擊云、查華軍與戰者、為第二十九軍第三十七師、該師由馮治安統率、馮於昨晚戰事發生前、方由北平赴保定任所、聞今晨日方提出之要求、其一為蘆溝橋之華軍、應加撤退、卽經中國代表毅然拒絕、談判乃於上午十一時决裂、下午日當局由冀察政委會外交委員會商請中國當局績作談話、於是雙方乃進行非正式之討論、同時中國領袖刻正在北平市長秦德純寓所、會商應付大局之辦法、（中央社八日路透電）</p>
<p>雙方交涉未有結果</p>
<p>［北平］蘆溝橋事件、中日外交人員魏宗瀚•松井等、八日晨十時開始交涉、日方要求駐蘆之二十九軍部隊須先撤退後、再談判一切、我方以日方要求不當、卽婉詞拒絕、致雙方交涉無結果、十時至十一時、日兵繼續進攻、但俱未得逞、十二時後、日方復派外交人員擬與秦德純馮治安協商一切、秦馮派魏宗瀚等接見、但交涉亦無何進步、刻冀察政委會日籍顧問櫻井•曁宛平縣長王冷齋•及市府朱專員等、仍在繼續斡旋、期事態不致擴大、又張自忠八日晨由津乘汽車來平、下午卽訪秦德純會商對策、據日軍部參謀長橋本向人表示、謂决不願使事態擴大、又東交民巷日兵營鋼甲車開出城、增厚兵力、又北寗路開赴通州之車、於十二時五十分起、業已停止開出、又北寗路下午四時應行開津之車、亦已停此駛出、（八日中央社電）</p>

<p>平外交團奔走調停</p>
<p>［北平］我當局對保守蘆溝橋抱極大决心、有蘆溝橋卽是我們的墳墓語、極憤慨、豐台至蘆溝橋鐵道兩旁、潛伏日方便衣隊多人、任意向行人放槍、無辜行人受傷者甚衆、外交團正奔走調停中、（八日專電）</p>

<p>平各城門俱已緊閉</p>
<p>［北平］在苗家地演習之日兵、約二百餘人、八日晨亦欲開援進城、現東直東便朝陽等門、俱已緊閉、廿九軍兵士多在城上警戒、刻平漢北上車只能開至長辛店為止、南下車八日晨均未開出、東交民巷自事變發生以後、戒備極嚴、我方警憲在外亦加崗戒備、冀察政委秦德純•馮治安等、八日晨召開緊急會議、商應付對策、並派魏宗瀚•王冷齋•林耕宇•等與日使館武官今井•松井•等會商解决辦法、聞我當局對此事件、决處以鎭靜、並不欲事態趨於擴大、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］日軍便衣隊現在蘆溝橋附近散佈梭巡、遇有行人、卽嗚槍阻止前進、至八日午十一時許、蘆溝橋日兵忽又反攻、但旋卽被我方擊退、又平則廣安永定等門亦俱已關閉、現平市情形如昔、一般市民、均頗安靜、（八日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>又一次侵略行動</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>華北日駐屯軍。昨日拂曉。突然猛襲宛平縣城。我守軍馮治安部。本捍衛國土的天職。予以抵抗。截至屬稿時止。雙方軍隊還在對峙中。這次衝突。在日軍方面。顯然又是有計劃的侵略行動。共性質之嚴重。是足以震驚全世界的。</p>
<p>然而這樣的事變至少在我國一般人。却也早可意料到幾分。我們知道在今日的日本。侵略主義還在抬頭。人民生活異常困苦。軍事當局為暫時消弭國內的危機起見。再用一回侵略行動。來轉移其本國人民的視線。原有很大的可能性。近數月來。華北日駐屯軍强化其組織。並且高唱準備第二九一八前夜之說。使華北方而局勢尤其見得緊張。這次事變無非是潛伏多時的危機一旦爆發罷了。</p>
<p>這次事變的發展前途。現在還難推斷。姑且就已知的幾點事實。約略表示些我們的感想。</p>
<p>第一。日軍進攻宛平縣城。所假借的口實。是“七日晚間演習時。忽聞槍聲。收隊點騐。缺少一兵。認為放槍者已入城。要求立卽率隊入城檢查。“這已顯得非常牽強。而日軍代表還在與我方專員進行調查之時。就用猛烈砲火轟擊縣城。更可表明日軍方面這種行動。含有充分的侵略性質。意在奪取宛平這個平漢綫上重要的戰略地。進而席捲平津。這樣的舉動。我們决不能不認為敵對行為。</p>
<p>第二。日本近衛首相剛在上月中旬發表談話說。“吾人對華北在原則上並非侵略主義。吾人自始至終卽努力於華北之經濟發展。而無武力侵略之意”。川越大使月初返任以後。又表示“…在消極方面。尤須注意勿使兩國間引起新糾紛。此點亦可謂為日本政府之方針”。現在言猶在耳。而華北日駐屯軍就乘深夜用大砲機槍殘殺我宛平城內無辜的軍民。這種彰明較著的侵略事實要不是證明着日本政府當局甚至在公開談話上也毫無信義。那就證明着日本國家機構的健全性是極有疑問的了。</p>
<p>第三。冀察當局對於日軍方面的無理要求。婉辭拒絕。當日軍猛攻宛平縣城時守軍馮治安部則又抱“與圍城同存亡”的决心竭力抗拒這都表示着二十九軍的忠勇。我们素知二十九軍能雊效忠中央。最近宋哲元的請假回籍。就為的是他奉行着中央各種命令。引起日方的不快。不得不暫時避一下日方說客的糾纏。現在從這次事變的表現。我們更可以袪除過去對於二十九軍的懷疑了。</p>
<p>第四。這次事變是日軍在我國領土上的非法演習所引起的。日本把我華北領土看做半殖民地。在那里擅自增兵。擅自演習這本是我國所萬不能容忍的情勢。從今次不幸事件的發生。我們尤其痛感到華北這種特殊化局面的禍害。</p>
<p>根據以上幾種觀點。我們認清在華北特殊化局面存在的期間。同樣的事變是隨時隨地很容易發生的。而這次事變。也就是豊台事件的重演。然而我們相信。政府一定早已有着充分的准備。能夠從容的加以應付。再不會讓這次事變有惡劣的結局的。</p>

<h3>西班牙叛軍當局擬棄意就英乎</h3>
<p>葡駐英公使轉致文書　願獲得財政上之援助</p>
<p>［倫敦］葡萄牙駐英公使蒙特羅曾於昨日訪謁艾登外相、頃悉蒙特羅曾以西班牙國民軍政府領袖弗朗哥將軍送致葡國總理兼外長薩拉查之節略一件、轉遞艾登外相、弗朗哥將軍在該節略內、對於意國援助國民軍一事之政治的性質、表示憂慮、並稱、渠决定保持西班牙領土完整、並願與英國政府成立妥洽、俾由英國予以經濟財政上之援助、以從事西班牙建設事業云、據聞艾登外相閱悉之後、僅表示英國政府業已收到此項文件、而不及其他、至於英國一部分人士、對於西班牙國民軍此項表示、雖具好滅，但因昨日國民軍政府發出非正式照會、以經濟報復相威脅、要求承認國民軍為交戰團體、因此良好印象亦已為之抵銷矣、又據樂觀派觀察家預測、關於志願兵自西班牙撤退一事、不久可有重要之發展云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙瓦倫西亞　據地中海西屬馮洪島傳來消息、本年六月二十八日晚間、意國軍艦多艘、在距該島十餘英里之海面、舉行示威、其中擊艘、則在該島附近之拉蒙訥要塞前面排成戰鬥行列云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］西班牙國民軍政府昨日向各國發出非正式之照會、要求承認西國民軍為交戰團體、此項照會頃已送達法國外交部、措詞極為鄭電、首稱、弗朗哥將軍奮鬥目的、係為剷除共產主義、藉以保障西班牙境內之西方文化、並納西國於復興之途徑、若干國家現在精神上為國民軍聲援者、旣無領土野心、亦不願變更地中海之現狀、今茲各國若拒絕承認國民軍為交戰團體、則他日國民軍若憶及各該國所採態度、從而設法應付、其勿以為怪云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］艾登外相本日曾與法國大使考實賡續進行談話、討論英國所擬折衷方案、此項方案主張、俟外國志願兵完全自西班牙撤退、並由外國視察員證實之後、始乃承認西國內戰當事雙方為交戰團體、頃悉法國始終認為承認交戰團體一事、未便照辦、以故對於英國折衷方案、自不致加以考慮、此外、昨日羅馬方面消息、謂意大利政府為盡量維持意德兩案起見、曾向出席調整委員會各國接洽、請其縝密研究對案之內容、此訊頃已證實、並悉已有十七國向意國提出肯定的答復、但此非謂各該國已捨棄英法兩國監察計劃、而贊成德意兩國對案之謂也、一般人現以為、調整委員會本月九日舉行全體會議之際、英國方面不至提出任何折衷案、調整委員會將僅聆取各國代表對於英法兩國計劃與德意兩國對案之意見、而不舉行投票、並為延宕時日、以冀避免決裂起見、將組織特種小組委員會、研究折衷方案、而俟調整委員會下星期舉行全體會議時、再行作最後之决定、届時如特種小組委員會不能擬就折衷方案、則各國代表、卽可恢復自由行動云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日韓人在漢販毒案</h3>
<p>被搜獲之毒品業已焚燬　日租界內有製毒廠數家　當局組成嚴禁毒品密網</p>
<p>字林報云、漢口中國查禁毒藥警察、近將搜獲之日本毒藥焚燬時、日本領事官員亦曾蒞止、此為中日當局長時期爭抗之結局、於此足徵華中毒藥貿易、外人實佔主要部分也、本年五月間、有一私運者、一為日人、一為韓人、在漢口車站被捕、二人皆穿特製之襯衣、其上滿綴橡皮袋、而將嘉藥縫於袋中、此項襯衣、共分三層、外層乃粗帆布者、中層乃黃油布者、裏層乃精美之橡皮者、各層皆有“日木製造”之字樣、私運者之一、挾海洛因七十八盎司、另一人俠紅丸十克蘭姆、均經當局沒收、而將其人押解日領事署、日領事即要求將毒藥交還、經兩星期之談判、日員始允當衆檢視此項毒藥、並監視焚燬、此項毒藥值價四千五百元、日本當局與中國禁烟當局會晤時、（日方以副領事一員•司法書記一員•藥劑師一人•為代表、）中國當局問目副領事、按照日領事法律、私運毒藥、處何罪罰、該員答稱、至大之處分為徒刑三個月、或繳罰鍰一百元、中國當局又問、曷為處罪若是之輕、渠答曰、“韓人甚貧、若輩之願處獄中、受日當局之供養、較之從事私運尤甚、故久禁若輩、殊無益也、“六月十一日、復有韓人一羣、在軍站被阻、搜出海洛因三十五盎司、其他毒藥八十七包、其首鎖携有日領事填發旅行河北河南山西之護照、當時諸韓人曾用武拒捕致傷華員三人、均入醫院醫治、日員到塲監視焚燬其自己之毒藥、不足為奕更對毒藥態度之確證、因此輩領事官員、現仍疪護漢口日租界內製造毒藥廠多家也、此種毒藥裂造廠、曾經報告國聯、且在彼等之報告中發表、故目下於此宣布其內容、殊無損害、且烴口僑民之不閉其目者、皆熟諗之也、</p>
<p>第一廠</p>
<p>製造海洛因與嗎啡、資本日金十萬元、每日能製嗎啡七十八盎司强、海洛因之數未詳、嗎啡每盎司售價三十四元、有日本警官五員守衛該廠大門、</p>
<p>第二廠</p>
<p>製造海洛因與嗎啡、日製四十盎司、由九家商店銷於武漢兩處、並運往河南江西兩省、</p>
<p>第三廠</p>
<p>製造紅丸、除天津外、此為最大之製造紅丸廠、每日能製一千盎司、合一年計之、數達十噸、每盎司售價三元、該廠僱用製造師九人、推銷員十五人、皆受日領事署保護、</p>
<p>衆信漢口日人所設之製造廠、在已往三年中、自一家至六家不等、迫國聯或中政府增强宣傳運動時、其數漸减、本年初、曾停閉兩家、顯因日內瓦嚴厲抨擊之故、廠家之數、雖見减少、但推銷員似已擴張其活動範圍、而入漢口四周之鄕區矣、近漢口西北應城曾拘獲私運者一人、其地乘長途汽車、一日可達、是人挟有日本毒藥十五盎司、華中毒藥製造與分銷之程度、可由漢口中國當局所發表本年六月一日止一年中漢口當局搜獲之毒藥總數淸單知其大概、</p>
<p>總類　　　　　　　　　　　盎司　　　　　　值價</p>
<p>丸藥（白黑紅黄四色）　　　六一，九四○　　一二四、六五○元</p>
<p>麻醉品（嗎啡海洛因高根）　三二，四六八　　三七七、六二二元</p>
<p>鴉片混合物　　　　　　　　一五，○二一　　一二、○一八元</p>
<p>總數　　　　　　　　　　　一○八，四二九　五一四、二八○元</p>
<p>據非官塲方面消息、法租界現有旅館十三家、出售鴉片、並供人賭博賣淫、</p>
<p>本年中政府所實施之主要計劃、為組織嚴禁麻醉品之密網、使販賣者難以脫網、而無利可獲、並令湖北省內吸食鴉片者皆向當局登記、本年四月十六日蔣委員長所派之禁烟專員曾召集會議、組成嚴禁麻醉品之密網、由各種機關二十所協助搜查、省政府縣政府與軍事機關皆在其內、此外有國民黨黨部三所•航業公會•碼頭小工公會•海關職員•及各航業局等、此項組織、僅為第一步、每一單位之人員、現均由偵察毒品處加以訓練、</p>
<p>鄂省烟民登記者、現共約十五萬人、此事進行、亦殊不易、其最佳之方法、當為派員一人至鄕間與農民縣長紳士聚談、烟民之姓氏不必詢諸縣兵、而可直接得諸甲兵、蓋此輩甲長、熟悉當地情形、凡烟民住址、無不知之也、若取此行動、則烟民當得三倍於今日登記之人數、</p>
<p>漢口人民初對於蔣委員長禁毒計劃、頗懷疑慮，今則咸贊助其六年肅淸計畫、一般與情對於蔣委員長均抱信任、而以為今卒以可能的穩健方法、漸近齋淸毒患之目的矣、</p>

<p>神州社云、自本市喧傳日南銀行運來偽滿中央銀行鈔票、將於市面上混用消息後、海關當局已嚴予注意、滬西各日商工廠、亦因有發工資時、將搭發二成偽滿鈔票之傳說、因致羣情惶恐、於昨日曾召集各廠代表會議、商訂拒收辦法、茲將各情誌後、</p>
<p>海關當局嚴密注意</p>
<p>邇來海關當局、因市上盛傳日商銀行、巳由偽滿運來大批中央銀行偽鈔、將在本市混用、已予以嚴密之注意、據該關當事人談、此次日銀行運入此項偽鈔、並未向海關報裝、而各輪埠船上關員密佈、亦不易偷運、大約係從陸路混入、私運無疑、海關已通令派在各鐵路郵局之檢查人員注意、嚴防此項偽鈔流入內地、以地人民免內受累、</p>
<p>日廠工人拒絕收用</p>
<p>本市各日商工廠工人、聞此次日人發放工資時將搭用二成偽鈔、咸甚惶恐、良以此項偽鈔、工人收下、市上不能應用、不啻將工資打一八扣、而再者現距十五發放工資之期已近、昨日上午、特在滬西存善里、由各廠工人推派代表二人召集會議、討論辦法、當一致議决、如日方搭用此項偽鈔、一致拒收、如有强令工人收受之舉動、工方為制止此項違法行為、不惜採取最後手段、再者工人大都不諳鈔票式樣、要求市商會將該項偽鈔式樣、刋印於各報上、俾工人明瞭、不致受欺、</p>

<h3>四川同鄕會等各團體聯呈請撤苛政</h3>
<p>本市四川同鄕會、成渝市商會、合組工商業考察團、川災救濟協會、川災善後研究會、昨聯名呈請行政院蔣院長財政部孔部長云、呈為聯名𥸤懇飭令撤廢川省四大苛政事、竊川省歷年苛政虐民不勝枚舉、人民苦於淫威之下、莫敢誰何、其病民最甚、足以使人民生機斷絕者、厥為濫征田賦、勒派烟款、强行騐契、以及重征地方稅四大苛政、屬會等曾分別一再呼籲、撤廢在案、逎川省府毫未省納、置民生疾苦於不顧、當前天災奇重、民窮財盡之時、而其潘征也、勒派也•强騐也•重征也•如故、不知人已待斃溝洫、救死猶恐不贍、何以應此紛如牛毛、</p>
<p>猛於虎口</p>
<p>之誅求、是不啻速全用人民於萬刦不復之地、查川省田賦、名義上今雖由去歲一年四征、减為一年三征、而其每征所收之練額、遠較歷來應收之數為鉅、益以省縣各項附加、事實上直等於－年八九征、乃至十一二征、而用省府乃美其名曰减征、及川災嚴重、舊歲欠糧、無法追收、迫而放棄、乃美其右曰免賦、又以冬荒春荒、今年新賦無法催比、改為下季一併統收、而美其名曰緩征、於是人民共聞减免之虛名、仍負十一二倍之苛賦、試問、</p>
<p>赤地千里</p>
<p>寸草不蓄、另款續付、尚不可堪、統而整收、其何能任、况全國統一、各省田賦、皆只一年一征、</p>
<p>川民何辜</p>
<p>獨遭荼毒、此屬會等特再聯名𥸤請、飭令撤廢濫徵田賦、實行一年一徵者一也、其次勒派烟款、全川無論大小各縣、每月納禁烟機關、强派於縣府、再由縣府强派於區署、再由區署强派於聯保主任、再由聯保主任及保長等、强迫人民、最奇者、不吸食亦必繳稅、估計全川每月額銷五百餘萬兩、全年六千五百餘萬兩、每兩以批價二元二角計、（各地方機關附加之手續費七八種尚不計焉）設令全部換回現款、每年又得一萬萬四千萬以上之收入、</p>
<p>名為禁烟</p>
<p>實則勒款、是不特有辱地方行政之尊嚴、寶大有悖中央之法令、今雖有改變辦法之風傳、但當此舉國厲行禁政之際、若仍聽其改頭換面、强行勒派、有類勸吸禍國病民、莫此為甚、此屬會等特再聯名籲請、飭令撤廢勒派烟款、實行禁烟條例者二也、其次、全川舉行騐契、名為保障人民業權、而實在藉此收費、川省契稅、向稱覆實、為各省冠、漏稅之契、幾無一戶、矧自民國三年以來早經施行騐契、</p>
<p>國號未更</p>
<p>何須重騐、今以百元以上之地契、每張收工本及騐換費各一元五角、即共計三元、百元以下之地契、收工本費一元五角、（地方機關附加之手續費尚不計內）如逾期未繳、加倍處罰、甚至拘押追繳、人民耗財失業、且以每張計算收費、以川省田地之廣大、契張之零雜、總計收費數量之大、固足駭人聽聞、無論富有之家、貧窮之戶、同遭全省之奇災、均不堪此新增之重負、聞尚有若干縣份、完糧後方能取契、甚至勒令富紳抬墊預繳、數及正糧二倍、是又藉無名之騐契、以催苛重之田糧也、如此苛求、</p>
<p>民何以生</p>
<p>此屬會等特再聯名𥸤請、飭令停止騐契者三也、其次則為正糧而外、又復征收地方稅、查地方稅、原由防區時代各軍之各種苛雜歸併而成、（如重慶護商費、渝䕫護商、渝北護商江防捐、百貨統稅、馬路捐、自來水捐、電力廠以及其他關卡市縣查騐費、落地捐等）至四川地方稅局、成立於民國二十四年、係對貨佔本、每種貨分上中下三等、估計每百元征進口稅十五元、出口稅十元、自中央舉辦營業稅以來、堆方稅應根本撤銷、不待請求、蓋中央早已明令、所有各省一切苛捐雜稅、統限於二十三年十二月以前一律裁撤盡凈在案、乃川省當局、竟</p>
<p>悍然不顧</p>
<p>仍行征收如故、且也川當局前此曾一再宣言、營業稅實施、地方稅即行撤銷、皇皇布告、川民周知、乃今營業稅已將遍設全川、地方稅依然不撤、當玆農村破產、災祲洊臻之際、救濟已苦不遑、乃復留此防區苛雜之遺毒、重累工商、全川人民、更無所逃命矣、此屬會等特再聯名𥸤請、撤廢重征地方稅者四也、以上所陳、為川省苛政中之最病民者、屬會等洞悉慘狀、用以聯名懇請鈞院（部）即日飭令川省府、早日實行撤廢此四大苛政、以舒民困、則災民戴德、災區稍蘇矣、迫切陳辭、不勝瞿企待命之至、謹呈、</p>

<p>楊嘯天氏防空播音</p>
<p>淞滬警備司令部司令楊虎、昨日下午二時四十五分、在市電台播音、題為“市民防空的意義和要領”、略為㊀“空中戰爭、對於都市市民的直接影響、”凡屬一個國家、一個民族、應付他所遭遇的戰爭、本來是全民族全國上午共同存亡關頭的共同責任、但是我們中國市民、一向把戰爭的一切責任、都推在前綫的軍隊身上、自己只在後方聽聽消息、這在只有陸戰和海戰的時代、容或可以做做這種夢、如今是空戰時代了、只要戰爭一揭幕、都市市民立刻就會聽見敵人的爆炸機的聲音、在頭上旋轉、立刻就可以使市民們的生命財產、化為灰燼、這是說明都市市民、對於空中戰爭的威脅、只有從事自衛的防護、不能像從前一樣、對戰爭可以不管不問、其次說到“市民防空的要領、”我們明瞭了上面所說的市民防空的意義、我們還得講求市民防空的方法、大槪可以區分若干種、㊀“警報”就是敵機來襲的時候、我們該有規定的報警的方法、㊁“燈火管制、”燈火管制的目的、是使都市變為黑暗、使敵機難於發現都市的位置、這裹有要注意的一點、就是都市四週的地方、也要同時施行燈火管制、否則四週依然有燈火的話、反為等於告訴敵人說、黑暗的部分是都市了、㊂“消防、”防空消防的意義、不單是救火、還要救助在屋子裹面被災的人、還要從事地域以內的消毒、㊃“救護、”當然就是用各種方法、救護一般被災的同胞、以上說的幾種、是市民防空的主要方法、也是市民防空主要的任務、不過這些方法的實行、要平時隨時研究、隨時準備才行、今天限於時間、不能詳細底說、最後我們可以下幾句結語、空戰是未來戰爭中的主要戰爭、都市是敵人轟炸的主要目標、都是無疑的事實、所以國家無空際、便可說是國防、市民不知防空、便可以說是不顧安全、所以希望市民諸君、認識市民防空意思的重要、並了解市民防空的各種方法、加以注意、加以研究、</p>

<h3>本市選舉事務所發表宣傳要點投票須知</h3>
<p>國民大會本市代表、定於七月十八日舉行選舉、上海市選舉事務所為欲使一般選民明瞭大會意旨、及踴躍參加選舉起見、製就國民大會上海市選舉宣傳要點、及投票須知兩種、特錄如下、</p>
<p>宣傳要點</p>
<p>國民大會、已經中央决定於本年十一月十二日、在首都召開大會、去年冬間、因事延期的代表選舉事務、在最近期間、便要開始從新進行了、我們對於這一個决定百年大計的集會、應該要有一個深切的了解和認識、㊀國民大會的任務、中國自被外力侵入以來、凡是國民、時時刻刻感覺到國亡種滅之禍、迫於眉睫、自九一八後來、這種共同的感覺、更是日日加劇、由共同的感覺、而發生共同的認識、知道非一致團結、無以救亡圖存、所以精神團結、共赴國難的口號、普及於全國、中國國民黨黨員、懍於責任和使命之重大、更知非一致團結、無以負荷、五全大會、認清這環境的需要、便决定召集國民大會、這次國民大會的唯一任務、便是制定憲法、亦即是踏入憲政之第一重門戶、將來憲政之能否順利推行、就要以這次國民大會總選舉之成績而定、何以說國民大會的唯一任務、是制定憲法、因為“憲法是由人民自己轉與自己”的、也就是說國民大會為制定憲法而召集的、所以憲法的主要目的、便是規定國家之組織、使整個中華民族聯合一氣、以不可動搖的信仰與堅决的意志、創立一個三民主羲的法治國家、詳細的說、因對外的防禦與對內的和平、以及社會公共福利、與未來時代之進步的保證、乃不能不制定一部完善的憲法來共同遵守、㊁我們怎樣選舉代表、國民大會的任務、旣如此重大、那麼我們對於他的產生代表的選舉、自然應該踴躍去參加、不過在選舉前還得明白我們應該怎樣去選舉代表、要曉得這種選舉、必須能夠正確的反映全國人民的公意、使舉出的每個代表、能與他職分相稱、所以我們一面固然要遵守選舉法則的規定、一面還得注意“賢良方正”的選擇、就是要使一般具有道德學問、為地方所敬仰的人士、能蔚為國用、現行國民大會代表選舉法、對於被選舉人的資格、除年滿二十歲及為該選舉區內之人民外、僅設有幾種消極的限制、（見選舉權第五條第十二條規定）此外雖有防範選舉舞弊的規定、恐亦難達到選舉賢能的目的、因為選舉的法則、只能防範由選舉方面所發生的弊端、而不能盡其選賢舉能的責任、那麼要希望大會出席的每個代表、都能盡其職責、能不負人民之所託、則必須預先對於所要選舉之代表人物、加以充分的選擇、因此我們在選舉的時候、對於被選舉人、（候選人）不能不有幾個準則去决定取舍、我們選舉的準則是、（第一）高尚的人格、因為人格不高尚的人、他的思想、一定不純正、他的心地、一定不光明、即徼倖做了代表、亦不免做出許多出賣民意的事、而失去社會的尊嚴與信賴、那麼不特是憲法的障碍、且是那個選舉區的恥辱、所以人格的高尚、是被選舉人最要的條件、（第二）豐富的學識經騐、學識這東西、本來很難講、有熟讀了五車書、而不辨菽麥的、只不過指學有專長、並非一定要博士碩士之類、因為有了學識和經騐、對於關係國家的重要問題、才能有澈底的認識、與合理的决定、所以學識與經騐、必不可少、（第三）𤍠心社會公益事業、大凡𤍠心公益事業的人、他的責任心必重、耐心必强、必能盡力替國家服務、這亦是選舉的最要對象、（第四）著有革命勞績、此層不可輕易看過、並非為革命同志推薦、因為曾經在革命戰綫上努力過的人、他多少是歷史的創造者、他負有推進社會的使命、抱着𤍠烈犧牲的精神、為社會人羣謀福利、這也是我們選擇的對象、由上述幾點、我們可以得到一個結論、就是對於選出代表、應按照上開準則、審愼周慮、成為一種正確的完善的選舉、使國家全體意見、得由大會盡量的照映出來、否則選舉不正確、人民之眞意必將為其代表所朦蔽、所歪曲、於是大會將不能成為民意之反映、人民所要求的憲法、將不能在大會中產生、於是形成大會意思與人民意思之衝突、國民代表、將不能代表選民的眞意了、（標語口號）㊀國民大會是制定憲法踏入憲政的重要階段、㊁國民大會是求中華民族的共同團結、㊂國民大會是鞏固中華民國對外的力量、㊃國民大會是集中人才共負復興民族的使命、㊄制定憲法是社會公益和時代進步的保證、㊅制定憲法可以使中華民國成為三民主義的法治國家、㊆召集國民大會是人民行使四權的先聲、㊇我們要明白國民大會的重要性踴躍去參加選舉、㊈我們要選舉人格高尚𤍠心公益的候選人做我們代表、㊉我們要選舉學識經騐豐富的候選人做我們代表、</p>

<h3>抗日之時期至矣</h3>
<p>— 中</p>
<p>汪先生說，我們不是排日，是抗日，恐怕至矣。</p>
<p>現在抗日之時期，昨據北平電，時夜十一時，松井武官以電話向當局稱，昨夜日軍一中隊，在蘆溝橋演習，忽聞搶聲，收隊點騐，缺少一兵，認為放槍者已入城，要求立即率隊入城搜查，等語。</p>
<p>我方以深夜日兵入城，殊引起地方不安，我在蘆溝橋部隊，昨竟日未出城，該槍絕非我方所放，婉詞拒絕。</p>
<p>旋松井又來電稱，我方如不允許，彼方將以武力包圍前進云云，時日軍對宛平縣城，已取包圍前進形勢，於是我方與日方商定，共同派員調查，詎正在交涉間，忽聞東門外槍聲大作，我軍未還擊，俄而西門外大砲機槍聲，又連續不絕。</p>
<p>據以上種種消息，已十足表現日方藉詞起釁，假端動員，毫無疑義，因為日方的大陸政策，本來蓄志已久，華北的明朗化，亦早明目張膽地高喊着，現在的蘆溝橋事件，自然是不言而喻的有組織，有計劃地强硬侵佔行為，在這樣情形之下，我們還有退讓的餘地麼？</p>
<p>日方在北平天津等地，時常演習軍隊，不論地點，不論晝夜，或是飛機，或是大砲，他們這種示威行動，早已司空見慣，我方為息事寗人貫澈和平起見，從未曾與他們作有效的裁制，此種態度，不但我國人知之，日方明達之士知之，卽世界各國亦無不知之，今日方於演習夜戰之餘，忽而藉口缺少一兵，欲入城搜查，此種事件，與藏本事件，同一顯明的機械作用，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>假定日方果無侵佔的野心，與整個的計劃，何以雙方正在派員商議之時，</p>
<p>東門外槍聲大作，我軍未曾還擊，而西門外大砲機槍，又連續不絕，其時日軍對宛平縣城，已取包圍形勢，這明明是日方有計劃有組織的侵佔行為，在如此情形之下，眞可說是可忍孰不可忍的一句古語了。</p>
<p>華北方面的情形，本來已成畸形之局面，因為我國酷好和平，相忍為日之下，在未曾破臉以前，决不願與他們算這篇壞賬，到現在的情形，我們還能够忍耐下去麼？還能彀吐面自乾麼？還能彀認為地方事件而姑且退讓以圖後日恢復麼？</p>
<p>我們是抗日，而不是排日，此其時矣，此其時矣。</p>

<h3>迷夢應該醒了</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>比爾波陷落以後，西班牙叛軍的氣燄便越發高漲起來，而幕後人助逆的形跡也更公開的暴露出來了。據近日的報載，則不干涉委員會不僅將有所謂“折衷方案”，以圖“轉圜餘地”，而叛軍的領袖更公然向各國提出照會，要求承認叛軍為交戰團體：“各國對於此項要求若加以拒絕，則吾人將來確定國際經濟政策之際，對於此等向吾人表示惡感之國家，當一律曁以閉門羹，屆時其勿以為怪也。</p>
<p>用威迫和利誘，如果施行於一個是非超過利害的國家，那將是無能為力的。然而現在的國際關係，顯然是並不如此。英法雖然有心想維持西海岸的監察計劃，但為了近利，為了叛軍的氣燄炙手可熱，看樣子，大概又將在强權前低下頭來，作為轉圜餘地的所謂“折衷方案”，不是就將提出實行了嗎？而承認叛軍為交戰團體，那至多也祇是時問問題。如果幕後的牽线者更露骨一些，如果叛軍能夠維持，或者再高漲些像現在的氣燄。</p>
<p>對這樣的事，慨感是無用的，因為過去的例子太多了。“文明”的意軍向“野蠻的阿比西尼亞“灌輸文明”的時候，不就來過這一套嗎，而現在，則連國聯會上的阿代表團也祇能自動聲請不出席了。類同的事情經過一多，感慨是應該消滅的，不是刺激得麻木，變成逃避：便是讓仇恨在心裏生了根，咬緊牙關來幹！</p>
<p>關於西班牙，是怎樣呢，弗朗哥給希特勒的“報告”說，“……西班牙境內戰事，萬不能支持至本年冬季，蓋一至嚴寒，國民軍士氣不振，勢難應戰：故現當不惜一切代價，而於未屆冬令以前結束戰爭，茍然，則必須有生力軍十二萬五千員名，飛機五百架，砲兵五十隊，坦克車多輛，方足以濟事。……據事業報記者解釋，德意兩國實因接得此項報告書，故乃於最近主張取銷海軍監察，俾可迅速以各項物質，增援西班牙國民軍，並使西班牙政府在其轄境各處海岸，均遭封鎖堵塞。（見中央巴黎哈瓦斯六日電）而另外一方面，從“火中的西班牙”那張紀錄影片告訴我們的，則我們知道西班牙的人民，是在怎樣勇敢地對叛軍浴血苦戰，他們甚至不吝惜把每幢財產所寄的房屋都變成戰壕，就連孩子們，他們也在替政府軍，也是替他們自己挖着戰壕！</p>
<p>從這顯明的對照中，我們是可以看出最後勝利的究將誰屬的。而從血的敎訓中，西班牙人民是已經踢開了感慨，把仇恨埋在心底，咬緊着牙關在幹了！</p>
<p>再來回頭看看我們自己，東四省淪亡到現在，是五年多了：名存實亡的所謂“華北特殊化”，到現在是更逼緊了一步，用盡心計在點起華北的烽火，想重來一個“九一八”，當各報號外帶來了日軍挑釁所引起的豐台蘆溝橋一帶的“衝突”，同胞們，你們有怎樣的感想呢：是無力的感慨？還是“寗為玉碎”，準備來幹一下？</p>
<p>迷夢應該醒了！勝利是握在我們手裏，是要我們自己去剏造的。</p>
<h3>鄉居隨筆</h3>
<p>— 李雯</p>
<p>我國的度量衡制度</p>
<p>每年夏天，總要搬一次家，巳成了習惯。幸虧我的輕便底家祇要三輛黄包車就能搬個乾净大吉了。夏天總以住鄉下為佳，房租又便宜，小橋流水，亦可避署：我是沒有固定職業的，大熱天也懶得走動，舊得享享清福。今年搬到這里的時候，却發生了一個難問題，是以前所沒有遇到，想到過的，眞是頗為轉手。</p>
<p>因為房東也是經濟人家，沒有僱得娘姨，搬來後第二天早上，就被買小菜問題遲疑了好半天。房東太太果然沒有想到這位新房客並不如其他的大學生（這里大學生在校外賃居的很多）一樣有錢去上館子；而新房客，又不好意思馬上託人家購買小菜。到將近中午時光，才硬着頭皮向房東借了籃秤上鎭去，這很使他們驚奇。起初堅邀我在他那里吃一頓，因為我不肯答應，就慨然允諾從期天起由他們代勞，這倒是感恩不盡的。謝了聲出門了。</p>
<p>自己雖然也會煮幾色菜，買菜這門功課却是十足外行。鄉下人處處誠實，見了穿西裝褲買小菜的，也知道可以敲敲小竹槓。光景菜攤將要歇市了，問問價錢還是老貴的，又做不來一個個銅子遞加起來的那套討價還價術，吃虧當然是吃虧定了。但是禍不單行，旣吃了老價錢，他們又說我的秤是二十四兩的，我不知房東太太倒底是不是黑心人；二十四兩秤與天平秤又是怎樣區別，只好由他們隨意秤了給我。然而菜蔬的多少是看得清楚的，他們給我秤的至少减少一倍以上。假如房東的秤果然是二十四兩的，英販手里的也是十二兩秤，小菜塲上每天爭執，口角不絕，這或許是個大原因。</p>
<p>幸而第二天起這任務由房東太太代勞了，否則，我想我又要搬回家。難問題是解决了，對於我國的度量衡制度却發生了疑問，譬如秤，旣規定了十六兩為天平，為什麼又隨意增减為十二兩與二十四兩的，售出的當然不肯每斤貨物吃虧八兩，購買者又怎肯十二兩作一斤呢？而偏偏雙方都不肯老老實實用天平秤。又如剪衣料，商店用的是市尺，而裁縫用的是足尺，算就了的衣料常常不能縫製，那末為什麼不一律用市尺或足尺呢？實在令人費解。其他如斗斛之大小不一，只好歸之於這店家之黑心不黑心了。</p>
<p>一個月前，讀到一條常熟通訊，是關於檢定酒壺量器，現在抄在下面：</p>
<p>“懸府以本邑酒商所用之酒壺，向以半斤，一斤，斤半，二斤四種之分，頃通知該業，以事屬量器，應加檢定，掉換新制，否則於端午節後，一律沒收。該商以損失殊鉅，特呈縣辯正，謂酒壺乃盛器之一種，分量另有戥子，茲為便利免致誤會起見，將酒壺名稱卽日改稱泰，大，中，小四號，請求備案。如果盛器而必欲檢定，則煮飯之鍋子，裝米之麻袋，亦將檢定……”</p>
<p>酒量不足，本來與酒壺無干，所謂酒壺乃盛器之一種，分曁另有戥子是也，不過那戥子是否標準，戥手能否戥足，到是個問題，而且酒家規矩，酒壺以摔瘸者為貴，卽使“掉換新制”，也是無補於事。</p>
<p>這關於度量衡的缺點，也可以說是流弊，應該如何“加以檢定”，各業應自動辦理，本文不為他們設計了。</p>
<p>不過在制定了標準度量衡之後，還有過與不及之流弊，那又是所謂“黑心”問題。中國人是個喜歡“佔便宜”的民族，也早已有定評了。</p>

<h3>Sudden Change in Situation in North China: Japanese Troops Bomb Wanping County Town</h3>
<p>Two Conflicts Result in Considerable Casualties; Gunfire Heard Again in the Evening</p>
<p>Both Sides in Standoff; Japanese Side Demands Withdrawal of Our Troops</p>
<p>Our Garrison Firmly Declares Willingness to Live or Die with Lugou Bridge</p>
<p>Martial Law Imposed in Beiping and Tianjin; Qin Dechun and Others Discuss Response Methods Until Late at Night</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At approximately 1:00 AM on the 8th, Chinese and Japanese troops clashed near Lugou Bridge in Fengtai. The conflict ceased at around 5:00 AM. Both sides are dispatching personnel to investigate the cause of the incident. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Japanese troops shelled Wanping County Town and Lugou Bridge last night. After both sides sent personnel to investigate and negotiate, the matter remained unresolved by noon. Gunfire ceased after 9:00 AM this morning, but shooting continued intermittently. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A Japanese company of soldiers, approximately 600 strong, conducting exercises at Lugou Bridge, suddenly opened fire on the 29th Army's infantry stationed at Lugou Bridge around midnight on the 7th. Both sides immediately engaged in contact, ceasing around 4:00 AM on the 8th. There were casualties on both sides. Lugou Bridge Station and all nearby coal yards were occupied by the Japanese troops. Wanping County Town was also surrounded by the Japanese troops. Currently, the 29th Army's troops stationed at Lugou Bridge remain in a standoff with the Japanese troops across the Yongding River. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Starting at 7:30 PM on the 8th, faint sounds of gunfire were again heard from the southwestern corner of the city of Beiping, indicating that Japanese troops had resumed their attacks against us. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Tianjin authorities received reports that by 6:00 PM on the 8th, the situation in Wanping had eased, and both sides were working towards a peaceful resolution. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] From 5:30 AM this morning, Japanese troops fired over a hundred shells at Lugou Bridge and Wanping County Town. Lugou Bridge was bombed and broken. Our army suffered over fifty casualties. At 7:45 AM, the Japanese side entered a ceasefire state to negotiate peaceful resolution methods with our side, requesting our troops stationed at Lugou Bridge to withdraw. Our side firmly refused. At 11:30 AM, peace broke down. After 11:30 AM, Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge immediately made tense deployments, taking a four-sided encirclement formation. Over 300 Japanese troops from Tongzhou and over 1,000 Japanese troops from Fengtai successively arrived outside Qihua Gate and outside Yongding Gate at around 1:00 PM. For city defense purposes, our side simultaneously closed the gates of the outer city. Temporary martial law was declared starting at 8:00 PM tonight. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Japanese side demanded that our army withdraw from Lugou Bridge, which our side refused. As of 9:00 PM tonight, the situation remains deadlocked. There was gunfire again at Lugou Bridge at 8:00 PM tonight. The Japanese Imai, Matsui, and Wachi repeatedly visited our authorities to negotiate. Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yunrong, and other important figures held meetings all day to discuss response methods. They were still at Qin's residence late into the night. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Since the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, Hashimoto, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison Army, and Sakurai, the Japanese advisor dispatched to Wanping County on the morning of the 8th to negotiate with the county magistrate Wang Lengqi, all hoped that the matter would not escalate. However, the conditions proposed by the Japanese side were too harsh, requiring our side to first withdraw the troops stationed at Lugou Bridge before discussing other issues. Our garrison resolutely stated that they were willing to live or die with Lugou Bridge, and declared that while peace was desirable, if the Japanese army demanded that our army withdraw from Lugou Bridge, then death was the only option. Lugou Bridge could be our grave. Morale was high, and everyone was determined to be shattered jade rather than a whole tile. Currently, our army is standing by in strict formation. If the Japanese side does not withdraw its unreasonable demands, our side will not hold talks with them. As for military matters, Ji Xingwen, the regimental commander of the Lugou Bridge garrison, is calmly responding. Currently, they are in a standoff in Heitao Village. According to our troops defending Wanping County Town, speaking to reporters from the city wall, the Japanese army had long planned to seize Lugou Bridge, conducting exercises in the area for days to scout out the situation. On the 7th, the Japanese army suddenly increased defenses in the area, which unfortunately led to this incident. The Japanese side's claim that a soldier was missing is purely an excuse. We serve the country and are determined to repay the country with our deaths, they said, with calm but tragic attitudes. Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, etc., all have calm attitudes, expressing their willingness to resolve the matter peacefully, but cannot agree to unreasonable conditions. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to an announcement by the Army Ministry at 9:30 PM on the 8th, Chinese and Japanese armies are currently in combat. (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Rumors are spreading like wildfire in Tianjin, but the general situation is calm. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, this location received news from Fengtai stating that the situation had eased, and both sides had stopped the conflict, with everything being resolved through investigation. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Tianjin-Beiping long-distance telephone lines were blocked once on the morning of the 8th, and resumed in the afternoon. However, there were many people making calls all day, making communication difficult. Traffic between Tianjin and Beiping was normal, except that at around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, our army at Beiping's Qianmen Station inspected for spies to prevent accidents, causing the 301st Tianjin-Pukou Express Train and the Third Beiping-Tianjin Express Train to be delayed by about an hour. Trains from Tianjin to Beiping were also delayed by one or two hours. Trains had to stop temporarily upon reaching Huangcun Station, and only dared to proceed after receiving a phone call from Fengtai. Fengtai Station was peaceful. (Special Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] According to transportation circles, telecommunications on the Pinghan Railway suddenly experienced obstructions starting on the morning of the 8th, currently only reaching Changxindian. The special express train southward from Beiping at 10:00 PM on the 8th had still not arrived in Zhengzhou as of the evening of the 8th. However, the Eurasian aircraft still passed through Zhengzhou southbound from Beiping on the 8th. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to railway sources, telecommunications between Beiping and Hankou on the Pinghan Railway experienced obstructions starting late on the 7th, and were still not clear as of the evening of the 8th. Although passenger tickets northward on the railway on the 8th were still sold to Beiping, it was heard that they could only reach Baoding. The southbound express train departing from Beiping on the morning of the 7th arrived at the Jianda Zhimeng Station at 7:20 PM on the 8th. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After the Lugou Bridge Incident was reported in Tianjin, along with reports of a large number of Japanese tanks passing through the city along the Beiping-Tianjin highway to Fengtai, and Japanese officers constantly flying to various places to scout, people inevitably experienced some shock, but remained calm. The local authorities here have always had thorough arrangements for public security in the city. Starting today, the police bureau has ordered its subordinates to pay closer attention to prevent petty criminals from taking the opportunity to act. Patrol police are all on special alert in their respective jurisdictions. The Japanese military department here also indirectly expressed to the local authorities that they do not want this matter to affect the public security of Tianjin. Also, telecommunications between Tianjin and Beiping are still open, but extremely congested. The Fifth Train between Beiping and Tianjin was originally scheduled to arrive in Tianjin at 6:00 PM, but was only able to depart from Beiping after 6:00 PM. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Beining Railway has stopped all trains on the entire line at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. A special martial law has also been implemented in Tianjin City. (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] This afternoon, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, but Chinese and Japanese troops continue to be in a standoff. (Domei News Agency Dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>The Authorities State the Truth of the Provocation</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the Lugou Bridge matter, the authorities issued a statement saying that around 11:00 PM on the 7th, they received a phone call from Japanese military officer Matsui, stating that the Japanese garrison was conducting exercises near Lugou Bridge, and that three mounted scouts were dispatched, with one missing and two returning to camp, requesting to enter Wanping County Town to search. The authorities informed them that our garrison in Wanping had not gone out, and to avoid alarming the people, we could conduct the search on their behalf, hoping that they would not enter the city. Shortly after, Matsui called again.</p>

<p>Repeatedly reported to the National Government. Simultaneously, our garrison in Wanping and the Commissioner's Office also telegraphed, reporting that a large number of Japanese troops were surrounding the county town, cutting off traffic. In order to avoid accidents, we have tightly closed the four gates, hoping for a quick negotiation, etc. The authorities telegraphed Matsui to negotiate and decided that both sides would send personnel to stop the conflict. Matsui sent his Deputy Special Agent Commander, Captain Terahira, and the commander of the first regiment stationed in Ping, San Taguchi. We sent Lin Qiyu, Councilor of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Zhou Yongye, Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, to rush there. Unexpectedly, after Terahira arrived, he still insisted that the Japanese troops had to enter. While they were arguing, gunshots suddenly broke out outside the East Gate, and artillery and gunshots were also discovered outside the West Gate. At this point, our garrison was forced to offer a brief resistance, but did not leave the city. Many soldiers were killed and wounded. Currently, there are nearly 500 Japanese troops in the forest on the Hun River bank, lying down in a prepared firing position. The situation is becoming serious. The Japanese side demanded the withdrawal of cavalry on the Yongding River bank. Our troops stationed there are all infantry and there is no cavalry. Obviously, it is an unreasonable demand. We are determined to deal with this calmly. If the Japanese side continues to exert pressure unreasonably, then we will have no choice but to uphold justice and will not back down. Also, the Wanping garrison has no artillery. Where did the artillery fire come from? It is self-evident. If an accident occurs because of this, all responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Lugou Bridge is located twenty miles southwest of Guang'anmen, and it is one of the famous scenic spots in western Beiping, controlling the key point of the Ping-Han transportation. Fengtai to its east is also the junction of the Ping-Han and Beiping-Liaoning railways. Four years ago, Wanping County was moved to Lugou Bridge. The county government is located west of the bridge. The town is not very large, but it is still solid. Since Japan increased its troops in North China last year, it has repeatedly built military barracks in Fengtai and sought to do the same in Lugou Bridge. Wang Lengqi, the county magistrate and commissioner, has made great efforts to deal with the situation and finally maintained the integrity of the land, which is considered to be hated by the Japanese side. This is the long-term cause of the incident. Recently, because the local authorities here have been staying in their hometown for a long time, negotiations have lost their target, and the National Assembly representatives are planning to proceed according to orders. After giving them some stimulation, they wanted to create a terror situation to achieve the purpose of pressuring the authorities to return to Beiping. This is the immediate cause of the incident. Recently, Japanese troops have frequently conducted exercises in Lugou Bridge, and they have all been camping with live ammunition, which the people have become accustomed to. However, on the night of the 7th, the number of people suddenly increased. At about 3:20 on the morning of the 8th, they suddenly ordered the people to form a skirmish line with Wanping County as the target, advancing rapidly to the west. When they were about 100 meters away, they opened artillery and fired guns, charging forward, and the conflict of this incident began. The reporter went to the local area for a visual inspection on the morning of the 8th. Because the four gates of the county town were tightly closed and there were many Japanese soldiers in the southeast corner of the city, it was impossible to enter the city. According to reports, when the Japanese troops attacked us, we initially suspected that it was a Japanese military exercise. When we saw that they were getting closer and closer, and they intended to disturb the public, we realized that they wanted to seize the county town. We immediately stood up to deal with the situation. For the sake of legitimate defense, we stayed away. Because the county town is old and small, if we do not resist, it will not be protected. Seeing our resistance, the Japanese side used small steel cannons and small over-the-mountain cannons to bombard us. Their goal was to seize the Lugou Stone Bridge and advance into the county town. From 3:30 a.m. on the 8th to 7:50 a.m. on the 8th, the sound of guns and cannons did not stop. About sixty or seventy of our people died. A farmer in Dajing Village was also beheaded by the Japanese army innocently. It is said that on the Japanese side, one warrant officer died and one second lieutenant was injured. From 8:00 to 11:00, it was the time for both sides to negotiate and mediate. At 11:00, our side could not accept the Japanese side's condition of withdrawing troops first. The Japanese side then started the attack again, and stopped again at 12:00. Until 6:00 in the afternoon, both sides were still in a standoff. This is the course of the Japanese army provoking our army. As for our authorities' attitude, we firmly hope for a peaceful resolution, but we will never accept the Japanese side's condition of withdrawing troops first. Therefore, although negotiations are in progress, whether there will be results is unknown. However, the public is indignant, morale is high, and the garrison is determined to coexist and die with the county town. The people in Beiping City are also extremely calm. Although martial law was declared at 8:00 p.m. on the 8th, there was no panic or panic among pedestrians on the road. The people of Dongping and Tianjin have become accustomed to this kind of life.

<p>Details of the Clash Between the Two Armies Reported Separately</p>
<p>[Beiping] Chinese and Japanese troops clashed with each other from 4:30 this morning, and fought until 9:30, when they "ceased fire". After 11:00, there was another short battle, but there were no further clashes this afternoon. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, including one officer and two non-commissioned officers. Among the wounded was one deputy lieutenant. The initial incident occurred last night, when a Japanese company was conducting combat exercises near Lugou Bridge. Unexpectedly, they clashed with the Chinese troops stationed there. According to the Japanese side, the Japanese soldiers initially heard several gunshots, which they believed were fired by the Chinese troops stationed in the Dragon Lord Temple. The Japanese military authorities in Beiping then demanded that Japanese soldiers be allowed to enter Wanping City to search for the shooters, but this was rejected by the Chinese side. Therefore, Japanese reinforcements rushed from Fengtai and began to surround Wanping City. This morning, five representatives of the Chinese and Japanese military and civilian authorities (three from the Chinese side and two from the Japanese side) went to Wanping from Beiping to investigate the case. However, while they were meeting, fighting suddenly broke out near Lugou Bridge, which ended at 9:30. The Chinese army suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army denied shelling Wanping, but the Chinese army claimed that artillery shells did fall in the city, causing loss of life and damage to property. After the fighting ended, Japanese planes dropped leaflets in the sky, demanding the withdrawal of the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army ignored them and prepared to defend the Ping-Han railway line. Therefore, at 11:00 a.m., the fighting resumed, but only lasted for a few minutes. Major Imai, the military attache stationed in Beiping, declared that in addition to shooting at Japanese soldiers last night, the Chinese army also opened fire first this morning. The Japanese army had no choice but to retaliate. The Chinese authorities claimed that when negotiations to resolve the initial dispute were underway, the Japanese army suddenly opened fire on the Chinese army, and the Chinese army only fired back as a last resort. It is reported that the Chinese army that fought was the 37th Division of the 29th Army, which was commanded by Feng Zhi'an. Feng had just left Beiping for Baoding to take office before the fighting broke out last night. He heard that the Japanese side had made a request this morning, one of which was that the Chinese army at Lugou Bridge should withdraw. The Chinese representative resolutely rejected it, and the negotiations broke down at 11:00 a.m. In the afternoon, the Japanese authorities asked the Chinese authorities to continue talks through the Diplomatic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council. Therefore, the two sides conducted informal discussions. At the same time, Chinese leaders were meeting at the residence of Qin Dechun, the mayor of Beiping, to discuss how to deal with the overall situation. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>No Results in Negotiations Between the Two Sides</p>
<p>[Beiping] Wei Zonghan, Matsui, and other Chinese and Japanese diplomats began negotiations on the Lugou Bridge incident at 10:00 a.m. on the 8th. The Japanese side demanded that the 29th Army stationed in Lugou must withdraw first before any further negotiations. Our side politely rejected this demand, deeming it inappropriate, resulting in no results from the negotiations between the two sides. From 10:00 to 11:00, Japanese soldiers continued to attack, but were unsuccessful. After 12:00, the Japanese side sent diplomats to consult with Qin Dechun and Feng Zhi'an on everything. Qin and Feng sent Wei Zonghan and others to meet with them, but there was no progress in the negotiations. Currently, Sakurai, the Japanese advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, Wang Lengzhai, the magistrate of Wanping County, and Zhu, the commissioner of the municipal government, are still continuing their mediation, hoping that the situation will not escalate. Also, Zhang Zizhong came to Beiping from Tianjin by car on the morning of the 8th, and immediately visited Qin Dechun in the afternoon to discuss countermeasures. According to Hashimoto, the chief of staff of the Japanese army, he said that he was determined not to let the situation escalate. Also, armored vehicles from the Japanese barracks in Dongjiaominxiang drove out of the city to increase their strength. In addition, the train on the Beiping-Liaoning Railway to Tongzhou was stopped at 12:50. Also, the train on the Beiping-Liaoning Railway that should have departed for Tianjin at 4:00 p.m. has also stopped leaving.</p>
<p>[Beiping] Today, Military Attache Imai, representing our side, met with Qin Dechun, Jia Deyao, and others to negotiate a solution. The talks began at 7:00 p.m. and lasted for about two hours. Qin expressed his intention to avoid escalating the incident and hoped to resolve it peacefully. The two sides were in complete agreement, but there was still a great distance between the specific conditions, and the key points had not yet been fully grasped. (8th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] In the Wanping incident, at about 11:00 a.m. today, the conflict resumed. The Japanese side urgently demanded that our garrison on the Yongding River bank withdraw, but we did not agree.

I am ordered to lodge a serious protest with your embassy and declare that all legal demands are reserved. Sino-Japanese relations have reached a critical juncture and must not be allowed to deteriorate further. It is requested that your side immediately telegraph the Japanese garrison in North China to immediately cease all military actions and order the representatives of the garrison army to work with personnel dispatched by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to seek a peaceful resolution based on accurate facts to avoid escalating the situation. Mr. Hidaka Shinrokuro, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, immediately stated that Japan had no intention of escalating this incident and was confident that it would not deteriorate, and promised to immediately telegraph the garrison army with our demands for the cessation of military actions.

<p>[Guling] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui is scheduled to fly to Nanjing from Lushan on the morning of the 9th to facilitate the handling of all matters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The following is what is known in Nanjing regarding the incident in which the Japanese army provoked our garrison troops at Lugouqiao near Beiping on the night of the 7th around 12:00 AM: ㊀ After the news of the Japanese army attacking our troops at Lugouqiao reached Nanjing, relevant agencies immediately inquired about the situation in Peiping and Tianjin by telegram and telephone. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang, who was in Lushan, to report and seek instructions. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo was still on his way to Lushan and was expected to arrive this morning. In the afternoon of the 8th, Foreign Minister Wang telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Lushan with instructions on how to respond. Although the temperature was nearly 90 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon of the 8th, key personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to work as usual. Vice Minister Chen Jie and Intelligence Division Chief Li Dijun were extremely busy and had not left the ministry by evening. Intelligence Division Chief Li Dijun was originally scheduled to go to Lushan today with International Affairs Division Chief Wu Songgao to attend the summer seminar, but due to this sudden incident, Li decided to postpone the trip. ㊁ Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is currently ill in Shanghai. At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, Dong Daoning, Section Chief of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited Hidaka at the Japanese Embassy in China to inquire about the matter. Military Attaché Ogi of the Japanese Embassy visited Section Chief Dong Daoning at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 6:30 PM in the evening and also mentioned the matter. The government has not yet made a formal representation before a detailed report arrives, as the key central figures have all gone to Lushan and must be consulted at any time. ㊂ Key personnel of the Japanese army stationed in North China said that the incident of the Japanese army's attack on our troops will not escalate. However, whether the intentions of the Japanese army are consistent with their statements should be judged by the facts. On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army once stopped attacking, but then resumed firing with guns and cannons. There are facts of the Japanese army attacking in the Fengtai and Wanping areas. Therefore, even if the Japanese army claims that the situation will not escalate, it is necessary to observe the measures taken by the Japanese authorities to stop it. This incident was entirely a provocation by the Japanese army, and the Japanese side should bear full responsibility. It is generally expected that the degree of future development of this matter will be apparent within days. ㊃ Yesterday, transportation between Nanjing and Peiping, telephone, telegram, postal service, and remittance were normal. It is reported that Peiping city has considerable inspections in order to maintain public order. Railway transportation between Peiping and Tianjin was slightly affected. Traffic on the Peiping-Hankou Railway was normal, which shows that our side is quite calm in maintaining transportation. The relevant departments received a report from Peiping Mayor Qin Dechun on the situation and are studying ways to deal with the aftermath. ㊄ The military and diplomatic agencies in Nanjing received a telegram from the Hebei-Chahar Political Council on the 8th, stating that at 0:30 AM this morning, the Japanese garrison army stationed in Fengtai suddenly attacked Feng Zhi'an's troops near Lugouqiao during night combat exercises, resulting in a conflict. The situation is serious, and Wei Zonghan, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, is in negotiations with the Japanese. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, all parties were deeply indignant, and the government attached extreme importance to it. However, because a detailed report has not yet been obtained, it is unwilling to make a formal statement rashly. However, based on the existing reports, there is no doubt that the responsibility for the incident does not lie with us. At a time when the Konoe cabinet is formed and Kawayagoe has returned to his post, all parties had some expectations for the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. It is indeed regrettable that this unfortunate incident has suddenly occurred. At this point, Sino-Japanese relations should only strive to improve and must not be allowed to deteriorate slightly. It is deeply hoped that the Japanese side will immediately cease military actions and resolve the matter peacefully based on accurate facts to avoid escalating the situation and increasing the obstacles to adjusting relations between the two countries.

<h3>Another Act of Aggression</h3>
<p>-- Should</p>
<p>Yesterday at dawn, the Japanese garrison in North China suddenly launched a fierce attack on Wanping County. Our defending troops, under Feng Zhi'an, resisted, fulfilling their natural duty to defend the national territory. As of the time of writing, the two sides are still in a standoff. This conflict is clearly another planned act of aggression by the Japanese, and its severity is enough to shock the world.</p>
<p>However, such an incident was, to some extent, predictable to the general public in our country. We know that in Japan today, expansionism is still on the rise, and people's lives are exceptionally difficult. The military authorities, in order to temporarily quell the domestic crisis, use an act of aggression to divert the attention of their own people. There was a great possibility of this. In recent months, the Japanese garrison in North China strengthened its organization and loudly proclaimed preparations for a "pre-2918 night," making the situation in North China particularly tense. This incident is simply the eruption of a crisis that has been lurking for a long time.</p>
<p>It is still difficult to predict the future development of this incident. Let us briefly express some of our thoughts based on the few known facts.</p>
<p>First, the excuse the Japanese army used to attack Wanping County was that "during exercises on the night of the 7th, gunshots were suddenly heard. When the troops assembled, one soldier was missing. It was believed that the shooter had entered the city and demanded to lead a team into the city for inspection." This already seems very far-fetched, and the fact that the Japanese representatives bombarded the county with fierce artillery fire while still conducting an investigation with our commissioners further demonstrates that the Japanese side's actions are fully aggressive, with the intention of seizing Wanping, a strategically important location on the Peiping-Hankou Line, and then sweeping through Peiping and Tianjin. We cannot help but consider such actions as hostile acts.</p>
<p>Second, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe stated in a speech just last month that "We are not, in principle, expansionist toward North China. We have consistently strived for the economic development of North China and have no intention of military aggression." After Ambassador Kawagoe returned to his post at the beginning of the month, he also stated "...in the negative aspect, special attention must be paid to avoiding new disputes between the two countries. This can also be said to be the policy of the Japanese government." Now, these words are still ringing in our ears, and the Japanese garrison in North China, in the middle of the night, used cannons and machine guns to massacre innocent soldiers and civilians in our Wanping city. This blatant act of aggression, if not proving that the Japanese government authorities have no credibility even in public statements, then proves that the integrity of the Japanese national structure is highly questionable.</p>
<p>Third, the Hebei-Chahar authorities tactfully refused the unreasonable demands of the Japanese army. When the Japanese army fiercely attacked Wanping County, the defending troops under Feng Zhi'an were determined to "coexist or perish with the besieged city" and resisted with all their might. This demonstrates the loyalty and bravery of the 29th Army. We have always known that the 29th Army can loyally serve the central government. Song Zheyuan's recent request for leave to return to his hometown was precisely because he implemented various orders from the central government, causing displeasure from the Japanese side, and he had to temporarily avoid the entanglement of Japanese lobbyists. Now, from the performance of this incident, we can further dispel past doubts about the 29th Army.</p>
<p>Fourth, this incident was caused by illegal exercises by the Japanese army on our country's territory. Japan regards our North China territory as a semi-colony, arbitrarily increasing its troops and conducting exercises, which is an intolerable situation for our country. From the occurrence of this unfortunate incident, we especially painfully feel the harm of this special situation in North China.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, we recognize that during the period when the special situation in North China exists, similar incidents are very likely to occur anytime and anywhere. And this incident is a re-enactment of the Fengtai Incident. However, we believe that the government must have already made full preparations to deal with it calmly and will not allow this incident to have a bad ending again.</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise in Palestine After Partition Plan Announced</h3>
<p>Jewish People Oppose, Emotions Run High; British Authorities Determined to Use Force to Quell Unrest</p>
<p>[London] After the Royal Commission's report recommending the partition of Palestine into Jewish, Arab, and British-mandated zones was released, it is said that British intelligence teams are paying close attention to the tense situation there, especially monitoring those suspected of inciting anti-British sentiment, because Britain believes that the situation in Palestine is related to the entire Mediterranean issue. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙ Jerusalem: After the British Royal Commission's report divided Palestine into three major regions: Jewish, Arab, and British mandated territories, a nationwide disturbance has broken out in Palestine. The authorities are working hard to prevent it, but so far, no riots have occurred. British police have all received gas masks in order to use tear gas when dealing with public riots. British, Arab, and Jewish police have all been transferred out of defense. In cafes, thousands of people gather to listen to broadcast news. The initial reaction to the report seems extremely calm, neither approving nor disapproving, and no formal criticism has been issued. British High Commissioner for Palestine, General Wavell, broadcast a speech after the release of the Commission's report, advocating that all parties accept the Commission's recommendations, as this approach will definitely create a new era of harmony and satisfaction for both Arabs and Jews. Before the report was released, the National Council of Palestinian Jews issued an exhortation, ordering the public to remain calm. However, the officers of the Jewish nationalist organization released a declaration afterwards, making the first public comment on the Commission's recommendations. Although the declaration promised to conduct a careful review after detailed study, it strongly refuted the report's conclusion that the mandate system was inappropriate. Furthermore, the election of representatives to the Jewish National Congress was actively underway all day yesterday. However, the voters were unaware of the report's contents before it was released, and the election was not allowed to be stopped immediately after the report was released. According to the opinions of the general Jewish population, the Royal Commission's recommendations represent "the end of a great dream and a great experiment." After listening to the broadcast of the report, bearded old men lined up and went to the "Wailing Wall" to pray that the country would not be divided. The Arab side also rose up to express its opposition. Fattsaba, Secretary of the Arab Higher Committee, declared, "This matter is extremely bad and will cause endless dissatisfaction."

<h3>Iraq and Iran Sign Treaty</h3>
<p>Border Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>⊙ Capital of Iraq: Iraq and Iran had a long-standing dispute over the border in the Shatt al-Arab region, which remained unresolved. Recently, the two countries signed a treaty in the capital of Iran, effectively resolving this dispute and various border issues between the two countries. People here express great satisfaction, believing that this treaty is an important step towards the establishment of broad understanding among the nations of the Near East. Iraqi government officials also believe that the diplomatic representatives of Turkey, Iraq, and Iran have now gathered in the capital of Iran, and the Afghan Foreign Minister, Fei Shi, will soon arrive in the capital of Iran. At that time, the Near East Four-Nation (i.e., Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan) Pact can be signed in the capital of Iran. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

<h3>Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Discussing Draft Election Law</p>
<p>[Moscow] The fourth plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union was held today at the Kremlin, discussing the draft law on elections to the Supreme Soviet. When the Presidium members Stalin, Molotov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Jubar, Kusi, Zdanov, and Yezhov attended the meeting, all members of the Central Executive Committee, guests, Stakhanovite workers from various Moscow factories, and representatives of workers from all walks of life warmly applauded them. The plenary session began with an opening speech by Kalinin, followed by a report on the draft election law by Yakovlev, who pointed out many specific examples to prove that no bourgeois country has such a democratic election law. In the most democratic bourgeois constitutions, the youth in the military cannot enjoy the right to vote, while Soviet Red Army soldiers have both the right to vote and to be elected. Soviet law stipulates that women are equal to men, there are no restrictions regarding nationality, and it guarantees that all public organizations have the right to nominate candidates for the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In his report, Yakovlev emphasized criticizing various shortcomings in the work of the Soviet system at all levels. Yakovlev said that the correct implementation of the Stalinist Constitution can guarantee the improvement of the work of the Soviet system at all levels from top to bottom. The Stalinist Constitution will lead the Soviet people to new victories and complete the construction of socialism. When the speech was over, the entire venue resounded with applause.

<h3>Greek Crown Prince Renounces Honor</h3>
<p>Marries Commoner Woman</p>
<p>⊙ Vienna: According to news received here from Athens, Prince Paul, brother of the King of Greece, has notified his brother that he is determined to marry a commoner woman, Komadaros, and will not change his mind. If the king does not allow it, he is happy to renounce the right to inherit the throne. Prince Paul traveled to Corfu, where the king is currently residing, to personally plead his case. Although the king was very moved, he firmly refused this request. Greek Prime Minister Metaxas, accompanied by the Minister of Interior, Minister of National Defense, and Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office, also traveled to Corfu to meet with the king and present the internal and external situation. Political figures believe that this trip is related to Prince Paul's matter, so they attach great importance to it. (National Overseas Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>U.S. President Roosevelt Hosts Lunch for Kong Xiangxi</h3>
<p>Cordial Conversation; Kong to Discuss Economy with Hull</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi returned here today from New York, stating that China does not intend to seek foreign credit within the scope of silver, but may discuss general silver issues with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Today, Kong and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting had lunch together in President Roosevelt's office at the White House for a close conversation. The lunch was slightly earlier because the President was going to watch a baseball game. Afterwards, Kong told the Associated Press that "the Philippine Islands produce many items needed by China. After the Philippines become independent, Philippine goods may greatly develop in the Chinese market, but it is still difficult to predict at present." If Philippine sugar is reduced in quota in the United States, the sales in China may become more important. Moreover, with the progress of China's economic situation, sugar imports may increase. Finally, the Far East may conclude another agreement outside the London Agreement to dispose of the remaining Philippine sugar. Kong will stay here for two or three days and then return to New York. According to Kong himself, this trip to the United States is "satisfying." After the ballgame today, the President's wife invited Wang Zhengting and his two daughters to a tea party at the White House. It is generally believed that this is the President's intention to make diplomatic relations more personal, so foreign envoys visiting the United States are often invited to tea parties at the White House. Tonight, the Chinese Embassy will host an informal banquet for Kong. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi declared today after dining with President Roosevelt at the White House that their exchange was very harmonious and it was one of the most pleasant days of his life. Kong's plans in Washington, D.C., after this are unknown, but it is understood that he will soon meet with U.S. Secretary of State Hull to discuss economic issues. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Begin on Coordination of China Policy</h3>
<p>Kadono Says Opportunity Ripe Today; British Business Community Hosts Banquet for Japanese Study Group</p>
<p>[London] Lord Hirst, President of the British Industrial Federation, hosted a banquet this afternoon for the Japanese commercial study group. After the banquet, the Japanese members began a meeting with the British-Japanese Trade Relations Committee of the Federation to discuss. This meeting may take two days to complete. Mr. Kadono Jukuro, leader of the Japanese study group, told a Reuters interviewer that the study group had no special agenda or special proposals and did not want to raise the issue of import quotas for British colonies, but believed that this matter could be raised by the British side. In his opinion, the most important event was Anglo-Japanese coordination in China. Sir Leith-Ross, Chief Economic Advisor to the British Government, raised this issue twice during his previous visit to Japan. The timing was not ripe at the time, but today it is more appropriate. When the Reuters interviewer asked about the nature of the so-called coordination, Kadono replied that China needs funds for development, and we would like to see China unified and prosperous, with everyone having more financial resources and being able to buy more goods. Japan is currently unable to provide China with loans itself, but Japan deeply desires to have friendly relations with China. The Japanese side believes that the issue of Anglo-Japanese distribution of the world market may be raised and believes that whether the import quotas of British colonies are increased or decreased, it may not have a significant impact on the quantity of imported Japanese goods, but if Britain cancels the quotas, it will be a very commendable gesture by Britain towards Japan and may produce tangible results. The Japanese side is now certain that British companies are willing to have greater freedom to import their machinery into Manchuria and hopes that talks between the British and Japanese governments can have the effect of improving Sino-Japanese relations. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The Japanese Economic Study Group, led by Kadono Jugoro, arrived here the day before yesterday and is scheduled to begin discussions with the British-Japanese Relations Committee tomorrow. A Havas interviewer recently interviewed the group leader Kadono Jugoro to inquire about the purpose of this visit to the UK and the procedures for the discussions. He replied in detail, stating that the main purpose of this visit by the Japanese Economic Study Group was to repay the visit of the British Industrial Federation Study Group to Japan two and a half years ago. As for the issues to be discussed this time, the Japanese Study Group has not determined them, and they will be decided by the British side. Kadono Jugoro continued, "Japan and 'Manchukuo' can become important sales markets for British steel machinery, especially 'Manchukuo.' Unfortunately, when the British Industrial Federation Study Group and Sir Leith-Ross, British government financial advisor, visited Japan two years ago, the environment was not very favorable for the development of Anglo-Japanese trade, but the atmosphere has greatly improved since then, and there is hope for the development of trade between the two countries. As for the issue of market competition between the British and Japanese cotton textile industries, if there is a need to raise it, it should be discussed with the former leaders of the Manchester cotton industry. The Japanese side does not intend to raise this issue, but I would not be surprised if the British side raised it for discussion." Finally, he requested that the issue of promoting Japanese goods in the British dominions and colonies should be discussed when negotiations are held on the redivision of the world market.

<h3>International Economic Conference Unlikely</h3>
<p>U.S. Expects European Countries to Resolve Political Issues First</p>
<p>[London] Regarding this country's Prime Minister Zeeland's efforts to remove obstacles to international trade, British well-informed sources have recently stated that Prime Minister Zeeland is welcomed everywhere, and authorities from various countries have expressed their willingness to reduce tariff barriers and stabilize international exchange rates in order to develop international trade. However, Prime Minister Zeeland has not discovered any factors to rely on to realize this wish, and therefore, an international economic conference is unlikely to be convened in the short term. In addition, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech yesterday, stating that U.S. foreign policy has four goals. Local well-informed sources interpreted this as an expression of the U.S.'s willingness to cooperate with European countries in economic and financial matters, but European countries must first carry out appeasement work politically. This is why close associates of British Prime Minister Chamberlain hope that German Foreign Minister Neurath can visit Britain in the near future. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>⊙ Charlottesville: U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles recently delivered a speech at the University of Virginia, discussing the Spanish issue. He stated, "Certain countries are currently striving to ensure that the principle of non-intervention is respected. The United States expresses its strong sympathy for this effort. If countries cannot strictly adhere to the principle of non-intervention, then a spark can ignite a prairie fire, and the whole world will inevitably fall into another catastrophe." He continued, stating that U.S. foreign policy has four main objectives: the revival of international moral principles, the elimination of tariff barriers, the limitation of armaments, and the holding of multilateral conferences by government representatives of various countries, as well as allowing various nations to have free relations with each other.

<h3>Romania Brewing Coup</h3>
<p>Intends to Overthrow the Imperial System</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest: It is rumored here that former Romanian Prime Minister Maniu is planning to launch a coup and form a republican government to replace the current monarchy. It is said that Maniu (Maniu is the leader of the Peasant Party) recently secretly discussed with former Foreign Minister Titulescu in Paris and agreed to overthrow the current government through open revolution. Because King Carol of Romania's change in foreign policy, Maniu deeply fears that the power of the Peasant Party will be weakened. Although a political friend of Maniu denied this rumor, the former Secretary-General of the Prime Minister, Tinia, admitted it and said that Maniu's hatred of King Carol of Romania had been a publicly recognized fact for many years, which lies in the fact that the King excluded him from government affairs.

<h3>Spanish Rebel Authorities Intend to Abandon Italy and Turn to Britain?</h3>
<p>Portuguese Ambassador to Britain Forwards Document, Willing to Obtain Financial Assistance</p>
<p>[London] Portuguese Ambassador to Britain Monteiro visited Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday. It is learned that Monteiro forwarded to Foreign Secretary Eden a memorandum sent by General Franco, leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, to Portuguese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Salazar. In the memorandum, General Franco expressed concerns about the political nature of Italy's assistance to the Nationalist army, and stated that he is determined to maintain Spain's territorial integrity and is willing to reach an agreement with the British government to obtain economic and financial assistance from Britain to engage in Spanish construction projects. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Eden, after reading it, only stated that the British government had received this document, and did not mention anything else. As for some people in Britain, although they are favorably inclined towards this expression of the Spanish Nationalist army, the good impression has been offset by the informal note issued by the Nationalist government yesterday, threatening economic retaliation and demanding recognition of the Nationalist army as a belligerent group. Furthermore, optimistic observers predict that there may be important developments soon regarding the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙ Valencia: According to news from Feng Hong Island in western Spanish Mediterranean, on the evening of June 28 this year, several Italian warships held a demonstration on the sea more than ten nautical miles from the island. Several of them formed a battle formation in front of the Ramon fortress near the island. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Spanish Nationalist government issued an informal note to various countries yesterday, requesting recognition of the Spanish Nationalist army as a belligerent group. This note has been sent to the French Foreign Ministry, and its wording is extremely solemn. It first stated that General Franco's struggle aims to eradicate communism, thereby safeguarding Western culture within Spain, and guiding Spain onto the path of revival. Some countries that are now morally supporting the Nationalist army have no territorial ambitions and do not want to change the status quo in the Mediterranean. If these countries refuse to recognize the Nationalist army as a belligerent group, then they should not be surprised if the Nationalist army remembers the attitude adopted by these countries and finds a way to deal with them in the future.

<h3>Britain and France Consult on the Spanish Issue</h3>
<p>Recognition of Belligerent Rights Has Difficulties</p>
<p>[Paris] The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee met today, and Foreign Minister Delbos attended to explain the situation of the Spanish Civil War in the past three weeks, and submitted a report on the progress of the exchange of opinions between the governments of the relevant countries on the Spanish issue, stating that the French government has reached an agreement with the British government and will adopt a firm position at the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee on the 9th of this month. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden continued talks with French Ambassador Corbin today to discuss the compromise plan proposed by Britain. This plan advocates that the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War should be recognized as belligerent groups only after foreign volunteer soldiers have completely withdrawn from Spain and have been verified by foreign inspectors. It is learned that France has always believed that it is not convenient to follow the practice of recognizing belligerent groups, so it will not consider the British compromise plan. In addition, according to news from Rome yesterday, the Italian government, in order to maintain the Italian-German case as much as possible, contacted the countries attending the Adjustment Committee and asked them to carefully study the content of the counter-case. This news has been confirmed and it is learned that 17 countries have given positive replies to Italy, but this does not mean that these countries have abandoned the British and French surveillance plan and supported the German and Italian counter-cases. It is now generally believed that when the Adjustment Committee holds a plenary meeting on the 9th of this month, the British side will not propose any compromise plan. The Adjustment Committee will only listen to the opinions of representatives of various countries on the British and French plans and the German and Italian counter-cases, and will not hold a vote. In order to delay the time and avoid a break, a special subcommittee will be organized to study the compromise plan, and a final decision will be made when the Adjustment Committee holds a plenary meeting next week. If the special subcommittee cannot formulate a compromise plan by then, the representatives of the various countries can restore their free action. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Describes Recent Situation of Scattered Anti-Japanese Volunteers in Northeast China</h3>
<p>They Occupy Areas in Various Provinces such as Pseudo-Binjiang and Heilongjiang, and the Japanese Army Formulates Three Countermeasures</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese Kwantung Army published a Japanese booklet entitled "Recent Security in Manchukuo" in May of this year. According to its description of the distribution of anti-Japanese volunteer armies in Northeast China (referred to by the Japanese as bandits), they are generally concentrated in Jidong and provinces such as Pseudo-Binjiang, Heilongjiang, and Sanjiang. Among them, the largest forces that the Japanese and puppet armies cannot underestimate are the forces of Xie Wendong (5,000 men) who appear near the Bin-Sui highway line, Chang You (3,000 men), and Guan Xianren (3,000 men). They usually enter and exit Yilan and Fangzheng counties, often taking the opportunity to attack the Japanese and puppet armies, making the Japanese and puppet armies exhausted in defense and suffering relatively heavy losses. The largest force operating in the areas of Wuchang, Weihe, and Zhuhe counties is the force of Qin Fenglin and Wu Long, each with about 4,000 men. They have a base in Donghe County and promote the purpose of resisting Japan and saving the country to the people, so the morale in that area is quite high. The anti-Japanese volunteers operating in the counties of Hulin, Raohe, Boli, and Mishan are led by Li Xuewan's "Northeast People's Revolutionary Army Fourth Army," which is the largest force, with about 5,000 men. There is also an anti-Japanese volunteer army led by Li Yanlu, with about 1,000 men, echoing Li Xuewan's army and fighting guerrillas along the river, making it extremely difficult for the Japanese and puppet armies to deal with them. Those operating in the counties of Tangyuan, Mulan, Suiling, and Fengshan on the left bank of the Songhua River are mainly the force of Zhao Xiangzhi, with about 5,000 men. Small anti-Japanese volunteer armies and small anti-Japanese militias in nearby areas are all under his command. They often use the method of feinting east and attacking west, placing the Japanese and puppet armies in a difficult situation, and the Japanese and puppet armies are also very afraid of their elite troops. The above-mentioned anti-Japanese volunteer armies all have complete organizations, sharp weapons, and adequate ammunition. They also maintain contact with each other and have high-level military and political institutions in Raohe, Hulin, and Mishan, so their actions are planned and disciplined, and they are deeply trusted by the people. The Japanese and puppet sides often point out that the various anti-Japanese volunteer armies are regarded as one faction by the people, making it particularly difficult to suppress them. Since the spring, they have implemented a policy of clearing the fields, building collective settlements, and burning all villages that could be used by the anti-Japanese volunteer armies, forcing the villagers to move to one place so that the anti-Japanese volunteer armies would lose the support of the people. However, after the villages were burned and more people lost their homes and jobs, more and more people angrily joined the anti-Japanese volunteer armies. Therefore, the implementation of this policy has failed. The new policies currently being formulated by the Japanese and puppet sides are: ⑴ Implementing the Baojia system, dividing ten households into one Pai, one settlement into one Jia, and one village into one Bao. Residents monitor and guarantee each other. If one person commits a crime or runs away, the ten households will be held jointly responsible to prevent communication with the anti-Japanese volunteer armies. ⑵ Implementing the Security Maintenance Association organization, with Dongjo Hideki, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, as the chairman. A Central Security Maintenance Association is established in Changchun, and branches are established in various counties, cities, and towns. The branch chairmen are appointed by Japanese military captains and commanders, and the puppet military brigade commanders and police chiefs serve as committee members. The powers and responsibilities of suppressing the anti-Japanese volunteer armies are controlled by the Japanese side to prevent ineffective attacks. ⑶ Confiscating civilian firearms to prevent them from being supplied to the anti-Japanese volunteer armies. One million eight thousand one hundred forty-nine firearms have been confiscated. Those who hide firearms or fail to report those who do will be punished. However, the villagers, fearing the severe punishment of the Japanese and puppet sides and preparing for future resistance, would rather bury them than voluntarily hand them over. Therefore, according to current estimates by the Japanese and puppet sides, there are at least 700,000 to 800,000 firearms, large and small, scattered among the people. This is also what the Japanese and puppet sides are most uneasy about. In the past year, the Japanese army and the anti-Japanese volunteer armies fought 1,891 times. About 13,384 anti-Japanese volunteer armies died in battle, while 1,070 Japanese soldiers died in battle. The number of those wounded is not counted. Comparing the two sides, we can see the fierceness of the anti-Japanese war and the bravery of the anti-Japanese volunteer armies in killing the enemy. Recently, throughout the Northeast, due to domestic unification, public sentiment has been growing, preparing to rise up in response. If there is an opportunity to recover the territory, as long as an order is issued, no less than hundreds of thousands of people in the four provinces will rise up. (7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Korean People Selling Drugs in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Seized Drugs Have Been Burned, Several Drug Factories in the Japanese Concession, Authorities Form a Tight Net to Strictly Prohibit Drugs</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that when the Chinese police in Hankou burned the seized Japanese drugs, Japanese consular officials also attended. This is the result of a long-term struggle between the Chinese and Japanese authorities, which shows that foreigners actually occupy a major part of the drug trade in China. In May of this year, a smuggler, one Japanese and one Korean, were arrested at the Hankou Railway Station. Both were wearing specially made shirts, which were full of rubber bags, and the drugs were sewn into the bags. This shirt is divided into three layers, the outer layer is made of coarse canvas, the middle layer is made of oilcloth, and the inner layer is made of fine rubber. Each layer has the words "Made in Japan". One of the smugglers carried 78 ounces of heroin, and the other carried 10 grams of red pills, all of which were confiscated by the authorities, and the people were escorted to the Japanese consulate. The Japanese consul then requested the return of the drugs. After two weeks of negotiations, the Japanese official agreed to publicly inspect the drugs and supervise their burning. These drugs were worth 4,500 yuan. When the Japanese authorities met with the Chinese anti-smoking authorities, (the Japanese side was represented by a deputy consul, a judicial clerk, and a pharmacist,) the Chinese authorities asked the deputy consul what the punishment was for smuggling drugs according to Japanese consular law. The official replied that the maximum punishment was three months of imprisonment or a fine of 100 yuan. The Chinese authorities asked again, why is the punishment so light? He replied, "Koreans are very poor. These people are willing to be in prison and supported by the Japanese authorities, which is even better than engaging in smuggling, so it is useless to detain these people for a long time." On June 11, another group of Koreans was stopped at the military station and found to have 35 ounces of heroin and 87 packages of other drugs. The head of the group carried a passport issued by the Japanese consul to travel to Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi. At that time, the Koreans used force to resist arrest and injured three Chinese officials, who were all admitted to the hospital for treatment. Japanese officials attending the scene to supervise the burning of their own drugs is not enough to be a definite proof of their attitude towards drugs, because these consular officials are still protecting many drug manufacturing plants in the Japanese concession in Hankou. These drug manufacturing plants have been reported to the League of Nations and published in their reports, so it is harmless to announce their content here, and all foreigners in Hankou who have not closed their eyes are familiar with them.</p>
<p>Factory 1</p>
<p>Manufactures heroin and morphine, with a capital of 100,000 Japanese yen. It can produce more than 78 ounces of morphine per day. The amount of heroin is unknown. The price of morphine is 34 yuan per ounce. There are five Japanese police officers guarding the factory gate.</p>
<p>Factory 2</p>
<p>Manufactures heroin and morphine, 40 ounces made in Japan, which are sold to Wuhan in two places by nine stores and transported to Henan and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>Factory 3</p>
<p>Manufactures red pills. In addition to Tianjin, this is the largest red pill manufacturing factory. It can produce 1,000 ounces per day, amounting to 10 tons per year. The price is 3 yuan per ounce. The factory employs nine manufacturers and fifteen salesmen, all of whom are protected by the Japanese consulate.</p>
<p>It is believed that the number of manufacturing plants set up by Japanese people in Hankou has ranged from one to six in the past three years. When the League of Nations or the Chinese government increased publicity campaigns, their number gradually decreased. Two of them were closed at the beginning of this year, apparently due to the severe criticism of Geneva. Although the number of factories has decreased, it seems that the salesmen have expanded their scope of activities and entered the rural areas around Hankou. Recently, a smuggler was detained in Yingcheng, northwest of Hankou, which can be reached by long-distance bus in one day. This person carried 15 ounces of Japanese drugs. The extent of drug manufacturing and distribution in China can be roughly known from the list of the total number of drugs seized by the Hankou authorities in the one year ending June 1 this year, which was published by the Hankou Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Category Ounces Value</p>
<p>Pills (white, black, red, and yellow) 61,940 124,650 yuan</p>
<p>Narcotics (morphine, heroin, cocaine) 32,468 377,622 yuan</p>
<p>Opium mixtures 15,021 12,018 yuan</p>
<p>Total 108,429 514,280 yuan</p>
<p>According to non-official sources, there are currently 13 hotels in the French Concession that sell opium and provide gambling and prostitution.</p>
<p>The main plan implemented by the central government this year is to organize a tight net to strictly prohibit narcotics, making it difficult for traffickers to escape the net and unprofitable, and ordering all opium smokers in Hubei Province to register with the authorities. On April 16 this year, the anti-smoking commissioner sent by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting to form a tight net to strictly prohibit narcotics, assisted by 20 various agencies in the search, including the provincial government, the county government, and military agencies, as well as three Kuomintang party departments, the Shipping Association, the Dock Coolies Association, customs officials, and various shipping bureaus. This organization is only the first step, and the personnel of each unit are now being trained by the drug detection office.</p>
<p>There are currently about 150,000 registered smokers in Hubei Province. This matter is also very difficult to carry out. The best way is to send one person to the countryside to talk with farmers, county chiefs, and gentry. The names of the smokers do not have to be asked of the county soldiers, but can be obtained directly from the armor soldiers, because these armor chiefs are familiar with the local situation and know the addresses of all the smokers. If this action is taken, the number of registered smokers should be three times the number of people registered today.</p>
<p>The people of Hankou were initially skeptical of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's drug prohibition plan, but now they all support his six-year eradication plan. The general public trusts Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and believes that he is gradually approaching the goal of eradicating the drug problem with possible and prudent methods.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Land Registration in the Eighth District</p>
<p>The Wuxian Land Administration Bureau has completed the land registration in the urban area. Starting this year, it will implement the collection of urban land value tax, but local people are requesting a postponement of the tax collection. The bureau started to handle the land registration in the eighth district on the 7th and has hired more than ten local people as investigation committee members to establish an investigation office to investigate land matters.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Establishment of Xinfu Creditors Association</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce requested an emergency meeting on the morning of the 7th based on letters from the Xinfu Bank Creditors Association, the Silk and Cloth Industry Association, and 16 stores including Longchangxiang. It convened a creditors meeting at 3:00 pm, chaired by Zhou Jiping. At that time, the creditors expressed their opinions and expressed their disagreement with going to Suzhou for registration. It was then decided to establish a creditors association on the same day, named the Changzhou Xinfu Bank Creditors Association. The association will temporarily be located at the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce to first handle creditor registration matters and publish a notice in the newspaper. The creditors who attended the meeting registered the amount of their claims separately after the meeting, totaling 43,809 yuan, which is about 4/10 of the claims in the city. The creditors who did not attend the meeting will be notified by the association in the newspaper to register at the meeting within three days to cooperate and proceed according to law.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wheat Merchants Compete to Collect Wheat</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the weather, the wheat harvest in the four villages of this city has been reduced, decreasing by 5/10 compared with previous years. Therefore, there are not many wheat arrivals at the rice shops after the wheat is launched, and there are very few wheat shipments to Wuxi by foreign gangs, but the cutting stomach is very smooth, which has never happened in previous years, resulting in higher market prices. Recently, there have been fewer arrivals in various industries, because the general farmers see that the market price is increasing and there is no reduction, and they are all watching to wait for a good price, and the general merchants also believe that the wheat price this time will never return to a low price, so there is a great profit, and they send employees to the countryside to compete for collection from house to house, but the number is very small, and it is still not enough to meet the sales demand. Yesterday, the total amount of goods arriving at Hexia was only over 10,000 stones, and the price of the attack was again skyrocketing. Each package has risen from 9.7 yuan to 9.99 yuan, breaking the 10 yuan mark. In addition, the market price of flour also rose by 5 cents yesterday. The price of each package at the foot of the mountain is 4.13 yuan, and the sales of the stomach are very good. There is still a trend of continued increase. Flour mills such as Jiufengmao and Xin are also competing to collect wheat to avoid a shortage of raw materials.</p>

<p>Various Counties Restore Construction Sections</p>
<p>In the past, many counties in Jiangsu Province had abolished the construction sections due to cost savings, and only construction directors and section members were appointed. Yesterday, the provincial government meeting decided that all counties in the province that had not established construction sections would establish sections uniformly starting from the 26th year. The salaries of the section chiefs would be appropriately increased according to the original salary amount of the former construction directors and section members.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Land Compensation for Highway Construction</p>
<p>The Baoluo Highway, running from outside the west gate of this county to Luodian in the Fourth District, was completed some time ago. Over 130 mu of private land was requisitioned for its construction. The county government has repeatedly received requests from district and township heads, urging them to provide appropriate compensation for the land to avoid losses for the people. It is now known that the authorities have decided, after discussion, to grant compensation of 50 yuan per mu, and have submitted this to the provincial government for approval and allocation of funds.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Improving Native Cloth Weaving Machines</p>
<p>The Nantong District Native Cloth Improvement Association is implementing a three-year plan, the first step of which is to improve weaving machines. A loan of 490,000 yuan has been arranged through a banking syndicate. A Native Cloth Loan Department has been established at the Bank of Communications to specifically handle loans for native cloth cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the Huainan Railway Completed</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway, in order to develop its operations, received a large investment from the Shanghai Construction Bank Corporation and was converted into a commercial operation. After its takeover on July 1st, it was renamed Huainan Mining Railway Co., Ltd., and its internal structure was reorganized. The bureau system was changed to a manager system. The former director, Cheng Shifan, was appointed as the deputy general manager of the entire railway. Operations have been greatly expanded. Fifty freight cars have been purchased for use, and the passenger ticket prices for each station have been revised to align them with those of the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou), Shanghai-Nanjing and Jiangnan Railways. This was announced and implemented on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Verdict Announced in Land Tax Embezzlement Case</p>

<p>Three Fraudsters Paraded Through the Streets</p>
<p>The Sixth District Security Headquarters recently learned that Zhang Laifu, Xue Debao, Dong Abing, and three others had impersonated inspectors from the headquarters and defrauded the manager of the Yihe Sugar Company in this port. They were apprehended by the Public Security Bureau and brought to the headquarters. They confessed without denial. Considering that the crimes of these criminals were likely not a one-time occurrence, and that there were likely many accomplices, starting from the 5th, soldiers were specially dispatched to escort them through the city streets to be paraded as a warning to the public, so that merchants and other victims could identify them. A strict investigation will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Fuyang</h3>

<h3>How to Mobilize to Go to the Countryside to Build Rural Areas by Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>(Speech at the Joint Meeting of Various Guangdong Provincial Government Departments Discussing the Mobilization for Rural Construction on June 28th)</p>
<p>Today, I have invited everyone here to report on the governance policies of Guangdong regarding the promotion of the rural construction movement, which is divided into four parts: ㊀ political construction, ㊁ economic construction, ㊂ cultural construction, and ㊃ rural construction. However, political construction, cultural construction, and economic construction should all be centered on rural construction, because not only is rural construction the focus of provincial administration, but it also has a significant relationship with national defense construction. As the saying goes, "If food is sufficient and there are enough soldiers, the people will trust [the government]." It is evident that the problem of the people's food and the problem of national defense have been two major political tasks for governing the country and ensuring the people's livelihood since ancient times. Moreover, the problem of food for the people of Guangdong is particularly serious and pressing compared to the rest of the country, so rural construction in Guangdong Province should be listed as the center of the implementation of new policies. Since taking office, I have discussed this several times with the heads of various responsible departments, exchanged views with local people and experts, and met with administrative commissioners of various districts and county magistrates to inquire about the actual situation in the localities. After two months, the conclusion is that rural construction is the most urgent issue at present. Now, after two months of effort, the three-year plan for rural construction is being drafted. The section on increasing food production has been drafted, and funding has also been secured, with a total investment of 30 million yuan per year from the government and the financial sector for rural construction. With a plan and funding, the most important issue now is how to promote it and how to mobilize. The form of China's rural society is still in the semi-natural economic stage, and it requires great force to move it forward. In particular, the local organizations in various counties of our Guangdong Province are too unsound. Even with a very thorough plan and sufficient funding, it will be useless and cannot be promoted. There are ninety-seven counties in Guangdong Province, and the population of nine-tenths of the counties has not been clearly surveyed, and the baojia system has not been properly organized. In this situation, even with a smart and capable county magistrate, given the large area of a county and the complexity of its affairs, one county magistrate is not omnipotent. How can he take care of everything and personally oversee everything in the county? Now that rural construction has progressed from drafting a plan to starting to implement it, who exactly are we relying on to do it, and how are we going to mobilize them? This is the biggest issue that we need to discuss together. Today, I would like to offer some personal opinions for your reference, hoping that you will jointly study a general rule and a method.

<h3>Japanese Factory Workers Resolve to Refuse Counterfeit Manchukuo Currency</h3>
<p>Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Print Samples in Newspapers, Customs Has Closely Monitored Inflow of Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, after rumors spread in the city that the Yokohama Specie Bank had shipped counterfeit Central Bank of Manchuria banknotes to be mixed into circulation in the market, the Customs authorities have paid close attention. Each Japanese factory in Western Shanghai has also been panicked because of rumors that two-tenths of their wages would be paid in counterfeit Manchukuo currency. Factory representatives met yesterday to discuss ways to refuse to accept the currency. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Customs Authorities Closely Monitor</p>
<p>Recently, the Customs authorities have paid close attention due to widespread rumors in the city that Japanese banks have shipped a large batch of counterfeit Central Bank of Manchuria banknotes from Manchukuo to be mixed into circulation in the city. According to the person in charge of the Customs, the Japanese banks did not declare the shipment of counterfeit currency to the Customs, and it is not easy to smuggle them through customs officials on each of the port ships, so it must have been smuggled in by land. The Customs has issued a notice to the inspectors stationed at various railway post offices to pay attention and strictly prevent the counterfeit currency from flowing into the interior, so that the people may not suffer.</p>
<p>Japanese Factory Workers Refuse to Accept</p>
<p>The workers of various Japanese factories in the city heard that the Japanese will use counterfeit currency for 20% of their wages, and are very panicked. If the workers accept the counterfeit currency, it cannot be used in the market, and it is equivalent to an 80% reduction in wages. As the wage payment period on the 15th is approaching, factory workers sent two representatives from each factory to a meeting in Cunshan Lane, Western Shanghai, yesterday morning to discuss solutions. They unanimously resolved that if the Japanese side uses this counterfeit currency, they will unanimously refuse to accept it. If there is any action to force the workers to accept it, the workers will not hesitate to take the final measures to stop this illegal act. Furthermore, most of the workers are not familiar with the appearance of the banknotes and request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to print the samples of the counterfeit currency in the newspapers so that the workers can understand and not be deceived.</p>
<h3>Jiang Dingwen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Going to Shaanxi in a Week, Not Returning to Fujian Temporarily</p>
<p>Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Fujian, was summoned to Lushan by telegram from Chairman Chiang. After completing his duties, he took the Taikoo Company's Gonghe ship east and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. He took the 11:00 PM express train to Shanghai that night and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he went straight to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. According to information learned by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, Jiang met with Xu Yongchang, Director of the Military Affairs Committee's Office, in Nanjing and had discussions with him. He also met with Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, in Shanghai to discuss everything. According to Zhu Pingzhi, Counselor of the Fujian Pacification Headquarters, Jiang will stay for about ten days and then go to Xi'an, not returning to Fujian temporarily.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Compatriot Association and Other Organizations Jointly Request the Abolition of Oppressive Policies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Compatriot Association, the Chengdu-Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, the Jointly Organized Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group, the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, and the Sichuan Disaster Relief Research Association, jointly submitted a request to President Chiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding the Jointly Named Earnest Request to Order the Abolition of the Four Major Oppressive Policies in Sichuan Province. We, the Sichuan province, have had countless oppressive policies over the years, and the people have suffered under oppressive power, daring not to oppose them. The ones that are most harmful to the people, and sufficient to cut off the people's livelihoods, are the excessive collection of land taxes, the levy of opium suppression funds, the forced verification of deeds, and the heavy collection of local taxes, the four major oppressive policies. The associations have separately and repeatedly called for the abolition of these policies, but the Sichuan Provincial Government has not adopted them, disregarding the people's suffering. At a time when natural disasters are extremely severe and the people are impoverished, the collection, levy, forced verification, and heavy collection are still the same. People are waiting to die in ditches and canals, and there is not enough to save the dead, how can we cope with this innumerable chaos?</p>
<p>More Ferocious Than Tigers</p>
<p>The demands are no less than leading the people to a place of no return. Although the Sichuan land tax is nominally reduced from four levies a year last year to three levies a year, the amount collected for each levy is much larger than the amount that should have been collected in the past. With the provincial and county surcharges, it is actually equivalent to eight or nine levies a year, or even eleven or twelve levies. But the provincial government praises it as a tax reduction. When the Sichuan disaster is severe, the old debts cannot be collected and are forced to be abandoned, it is praised as a tax exemption. Because of the winter famine and spring famine, the new taxes this year cannot be urged, and they are changed to be collected together in the next season, which is praised as a tax deferral. As a result, the people have heard the false name of reduction and exemption, but they still bear the heavy tax of eleven or twelve times. I ask,</p>
<p>Land is Barren for a Thousand Miles</p>
<p>Not even an inch of grass remains. It is unbearable to pay the renewal fee. The collection of all of them will be integrated, how can they bear it? Moreover, in the national unification, the land taxes of all provinces are only levied once a year.</p>
<p>What Crime Have Sichuan People Committed?</p>
<p>They are uniquely poisoned. Therefore, the associations specially jointly request that you order the abolition of the excessive collection of land taxes and implement a one-year levy. Secondly, the levy of opium suppression funds. All counties in Sichuan, large and small, are required to pay to the opium suppression agencies every month, which are forcibly assigned to the county government, then forcibly assigned to the district office, then forcibly assigned to the joint guarantee director, and then forced to the people by the joint guarantee director and the保長. The strangest thing is that even those who do not smoke must pay taxes. It is estimated that the total monthly sales in Sichuan are more than 5 million taels, and more than 65 million taels per year. Each tael is calculated at a wholesale price of 2.2 yuan (excluding the seven or eight kinds of handling fees added by local agencies). If the total amount is exchanged for cash, there will be more than 140 million yuan in revenue per year.</p>
<p>Nominally Banning Opium</p>
<p>In reality, it is levying funds. It is not only insulting to the dignity of local administration, but also greatly contrary to the laws of the central government. Although there are rumors of changing the method, if we still allow it to change its face and force the levy when the whole country is strictly enforcing the prohibition of politics, it is like encouraging the harm to the country and the people. Therefore, the associations specially jointly appeal to you to order the abolition of the opium suppression funds and implement the opium suppression regulations. Thirdly, the entire Sichuan province is carrying out the verification of deeds, nominally to protect the people's property rights, but in reality to collect fees. The deed tax in Sichuan has always been regarded as a reality, which is the crown of all provinces. There are hardly any households that leak taxes. Since the Republic of China in three years, the verification of deeds has been implemented early.</p>
<p>The National Name Has Not Changed</p>
<p>Why re-verify? Now, for land deeds above 100 yuan, each sheet is charged 1.5 yuan for labor and verification fees, which is a total of 3 yuan. For land deeds below 100 yuan, a labor fee of 1.5 yuan is charged (excluding the handling fees added by local agencies). If it is not paid by the deadline, the penalty will be doubled, and even detained and recovered. People spend money and lose their jobs. And calculating the cost per sheet, the vastness of Sichuan's land and the disarray of the deed, the total amount of charges is shocking to hear. Whether it is a wealthy family or a poor household, they have suffered the same strange disaster in the province, and they cannot bear the heavy burden of this new addition. It is heard that there are still some counties that can only obtain deeds after completing the grain payment, and even force the wealthy gentry to raise pads and prepay, two times the amount of the main grain. It is also using the verification of deeds without name to urge the heavy land grain. Such harsh demands,</p>
<p>How Can People Live?</p>
<p>The associations specially jointly request you to order the cessation of deed verification. Fourthly, in addition to the main grain, local taxes are levied. Originally, local taxes were formed by the merger of various harsh miscellaneous taxes of various armies in the defense zone era (such as Chongqing Commercial Protection Fee, Yuyukui Commercial Protection, Yubei Commercial Protection Jiangfang Donation, Department Store Unified Tax, Road Donation, Tap Water Donation, Power Plant and other checkpoints and county inspection fees, landing donation, etc.). The Sichuan Local Taxation Bureau was established in 1935. It is based on the capital of goods, and each type of goods is divided into upper, middle, and lower grades, estimating that 15 yuan is levied for every 100 yuan of import tax, and 10 yuan for export tax. Since the central government launched the business tax, the heap tax should be completely abolished, without waiting for a request. The central government has long made it clear that all harsh miscellaneous taxes in all provinces are limited to be completely abolished before December 23. However, the Sichuan authorities</p>
<p>Blatantly Disregard</p>
<p>Still collecting as before, and the Sichuan authorities have repeatedly declared that the business tax will be implemented and the local tax will be abolished. The emperor's proclamation is known to the people of Sichuan. Today, the business tax will be set up throughout Sichuan, and the local tax will still not be abolished. At the time of rural bankruptcy and frequent disasters, relief is already hard to come by, but retaining the legacy of the harsh miscellaneous taxes of the defense zone will heavily burden industry and commerce, and the people of Sichuan have nowhere to escape. The associations specially jointly request you to abolish the heavy levy of local taxes. The above is the most harmful of the oppressive policies in Sichuan province. The associations understand the tragic situation and jointly request the钧院（部） to order the Sichuan Provincial Government to abolish these four major oppressive policies as soon as possible to relieve the people's difficulties, and the disaster victims will be grateful and the disaster area will be slightly revived. A pressing statement, with utmost eagerness to await orders. Respectfully presented.</p>

<h3>Hai Yuan's Return to Shanghai After Refloating, Bureau Investigates the Accident</h3>
<p>Establishing an Investigation Committee to Inquire into the Cause of the Reef Impact</p>
<p>In the latter half of last month, the Hai Yuan vessel, which struck a reef near Jishui Gate outside Hong Kong, was salvaged by Taikoo Dockyard upon commission by the bureau. Our bureau dispatched Evaluation Section Chief Li Yunqu to oversee the rescue. The foreign personnel salvaging the vessel discarded the cargo from the first two holds into the sea. After three weeks, the breached hull was patched, and the vessel was towed off the reef. Subsequently, it underwent extensive repairs at Taikoo Dockyard, only completing repairs on the 3rd of this month. It then returned to Shanghai, arriving yesterday morning. It is estimated that the various losses incurred by the Hai Yuan vessel due to this reef impact, including cargo, hull, and schedule disruptions, amount to over one million yuan, nearly the entire cost of building the Hai Yuan. Upon the ship's arrival in Shanghai yesterday morning, the bureau immediately formed the "Hai Yuan Vessel Accident Investigation Committee," with Cai Zengji serving as chairman. Deputy Manager Shen Zhongyi, Chief of Business Zeng Guangqing, Head of the Ship Section Chen Shaoji, Deputy Head Zhou Houkun, Evaluation Section Chief Li Yunqu, and Feng Feng of the Maritime Section were appointed as investigators. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, Captain Strong Hannason of the Hai Yuan, along with the first and second mates and other senior officers, were summoned to the bureau. The committee members interrogated them about the circumstances of the Hai Yuan's reef impact and whether any negligence of duty contributed to the accident. The committee members conducted a detailed inquiry, first questioning the captain and then the first and second mates. All questions and answers were recorded by Feng Feng to serve as a basis for investigating the case. The interrogation lasted three hours, from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM, without completing the entire inquiry. Due to the late hour, the meeting was adjourned, and the crew members returned to their duties on the ship. The second interrogation is scheduled to continue to hear all the crew members' testimonies. After the interrogation is completed, the testimonies will be transcribed and submitted to the ministry for review. Copies will also be sent to the Navigation Administration Bureau for review in preparation for the next interrogation. The ministry will send committee members, and Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau Wu Yu will come to question them to determine responsibility and take appropriate action. Therefore, the testimonies cannot be made public at this time. It is reported that after the incident, the second mate, Luo Bingqiu, instructed two helmsmen to work, leading to a conflict. The second mate reprimanded the two helmsmen, who disobeyed, resulting in a verbal altercation that escalated into a physical fight. Luo Bingqiu was injured by the two helmsmen. Today, Second Mate Luo submitted a report detailing the incident to General Manager Cai for review. After interrogating the crew members, Cai Zengji separately summoned Luo Bingqiu and the two helmsmen to the bureau for a confrontation. As a result, the helmsmen were found to have disobeyed orders, defied authority, and committed assault, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the law. They were immediately dismissed. The Ship Section was notified to promptly dispatch replacement helmsmen to the ship. The ship is scheduled to depart for Qingdao today for a summer break. Upon its return to Shanghai, the crew will be interrogated again.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Smuggling Movement Sends a Letter to the Municipal Council Requesting Non-Interference</h3>
<p>Protecting Legitimate Commerce of All Nations, Not Disrupting Social Order</p>
<p>The Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee of Shanghai sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the rampant influx and dumping of smuggled goods on the market has severely impacted our nation's industries and businesses, and poses a similar threat to commerce from all nations in China. Therefore, preventing smuggling is a shared goal of all legitimate merchants. Our city's communities, deeply concerned about the prevalence of smuggling, have organized this committee to encourage all Chinese citizens to refrain from buying and selling smuggled goods in order to stem the tide of smuggling. Recently, our committee requested that movie theaters screen promotional slogans to broaden our publicity efforts. However, we have received numerous reports that your council has dispatched personnel to prohibit this, which has caused us great consternation. After repeated declarations by this committee, the Anti-Smuggling Movement aims purely to save the national economy and protect the legitimate commerce of all nations. It neither disrupts social order nor harms international relations. We are deeply puzzled by your council's arbitrary interference. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to request that your council recognize the stance of our committee and refrain from such unreasonable interference in the future, in order to alleviate public anger and achieve the goal of preventing smuggling and safeguarding legitimate commerce. We eagerly await your response."</p>

<p>Yang Xiaotian Lectures on the Essentials of Air Defense, Special Fireworks Displayed in the Evening for Added Entertainment</p>
<p>The 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Municipal Government officially commenced the day before yesterday amidst the joyful cheers of the people. Yesterday was the second day, and people from all walks of life flocked to the central district to visit the seven major exhibitions. The lively atmosphere was undiminished from the previous day. Especially as the sun set and a cool breeze arrived, visitors were as numerous as weaving threads, and the traffic was as dense as shuttles. They only began to disperse late into the night. The events of yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Crowds Swarm the Exhibition Venues</p>
<p>Yesterday, the seven major exhibitions remained open as usual. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life were able to admire the various new constructions in the city center district and view various valuable exhibits. Therefore, they braved the distance and the summer heat to visit, resulting in a constant stream of visitors. The air defense exhibition was open to the public and free of charge, attracting especially large crowds. The number of visitors exceeded ten thousand in a single day. The handicrafts exhibition venue offered low prices and displayed extremely valuable items, also attracting no fewer than ten thousand visitors. Other exhibitions, such as the machinery industry, industrial safety, municipal sanitation, and literature exhibitions, each showcased their strengths and featured extensive collections, proving quite captivating. Therefore, each exhibition attracted no fewer than several thousand visitors. The intense activity was evident to all.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaotian's Radio Broadcast on Air Defense</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 PM, Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, broadcast a speech on the municipal radio station titled "The Significance and Essentials of Air Defense for Citizens," outlining the following: ⑴ "The direct impact of aerial warfare on urban citizens." In addressing the wars encountered by a nation or an ethnic group, the common responsibility of the entire nation should be to jointly survive or perish. However, Chinese citizens have historically placed all responsibility for war on the soldiers at the front lines, only listening to news from the rear. This was perhaps acceptable during the era of land and sea warfare. However, in the era of aerial warfare, as soon as war commences, urban citizens will immediately hear the sound of enemy bombers circling overhead, threatening to reduce their lives and property to ashes. This illustrates that urban citizens must engage in self-defense against the threat of aerial warfare, unlike in the past when they could ignore war. Secondly, he discussed "the essentials of air defense for citizens." Having understood the significance of air defense for citizens as mentioned above, we must also study air defense methods. Generally, these can be categorized into several types: ⑴ "Alarm," which refers to the designated method for alerting the public when enemy aircraft approach. ⑵ "Blackout," the purpose of which is to darken the city, making it difficult for enemy aircraft to locate. It is important to note that the areas surrounding the city must also implement blackouts simultaneously. Otherwise, if lights remain on in the surrounding areas, it would be equivalent to informing the enemy that the dark area is the city. ⑶ "Firefighting," the purpose of which is not only to extinguish fires but also to rescue people trapped inside buildings and to disinfect the area. ⑷ "Rescue," which naturally involves using various methods to rescue fellow citizens affected by the disaster. The above are the main methods and tasks of air defense for citizens. However, the implementation of these methods requires continuous research and preparation. Due to time constraints, I cannot elaborate in detail today. In conclusion, we can state that aerial warfare is the primary form of warfare in future conflicts, and cities are the primary targets of enemy bombing. Therefore, it can be said that a nation without air defense lacks national defense, and citizens who are unaware of air defense neglect their safety. Therefore, I hope that all citizens will recognize the importance of understanding air defense and learn about the various methods of air defense, paying close attention and conducting research.</p>
<p>Special Fireworks Displayed in the Evening</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Peking Opera performances were held in front of the Municipal Government and at the Nanshi Public Sports Field, with participation from performers from the Big Stage Comedian Monologue Research Association, Drama Research Association, and the Great World Drama Society. Tonight, there will be a special fireworks display by Zhan Songshan, featuring constantly changing scenes and numerous programs, including city towers and pavilions, flowers, and rare birds, all meticulously presented. It promises to be an unprecedented spectacular performance in Shanghai. The performance venue is located in the sports field in the city center district.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Celebrations by Citizens</p>
<p>The Zhabei Keming Road Tianshou Lane has an autonomous association, managed by those with a passion for public welfare. Yesterday, the lane held a celebration, and Liang Fuchu, Chief of the North Station Police Precinct, was invited to give a speech, offering many admonishments. After the meeting, various recreational activities were held, such as comedy skits, harmonica performances, accordion performances, Cantonese music, and lion dances, all performed with great skill. Residents in the vicinity flocked to watch, creating a lively scene. The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, First District Branch, erected a pine and cypress archway with electric lights at the Bund on Nanjing Road, visible from three sides. The horizontal inscription read "Shanghai Municipal Government 10th Anniversary," with couplets on each side. One couplet read, "The people's interests rely on government protection, the nation's policies depend on the people's adherence." Another couplet read, "The nation's rise and fall is the responsibility of every citizen, all united as one to resist foreign aggression." The third couplet read, "The hidden worries of the future are just beginning, active construction is our inescapable duty." The electric lights illuminated the structure at night, creating a magnificent sight. It is reported that the cost was approximately one thousand gold coins.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Election Office Announces Key Promotional Points and Voting Instructions</h3>
<p>The election of representatives from Shanghai to the National Assembly is scheduled for July 18th. In order to ensure that voters understand the purpose of the assembly and actively participate in the election, the Shanghai Municipal Election Office has prepared two documents: "Key Promotional Points for the Shanghai Municipal National Assembly Election" and "Voting Instructions." They are listed below.</p>
<p>Key Promotional Points</p>
<p>The Central Government has decided to convene the National Assembly in the capital on November 12th of this year. The representative election, which was postponed last winter, will commence anew in the near future. We should have a deep understanding and recognition of this gathering, which will determine the direction of the next century. ⑴ The task of the National Assembly. Since China was invaded by foreign powers, all citizens have constantly felt the imminent danger of national subjugation and ethnic extinction. Since the September 18th Incident, this shared feeling has intensified daily. From this shared feeling arose a shared understanding that only unity can save the nation and ensure survival. Therefore, the slogan of spiritual unity and jointly facing national crisis has spread throughout the country. Members of the Chinese Nationalist Party, aware of the significance of their responsibilities and mission, recognize that they can only fulfill them through unity. The Fifth Plenary Session, recognizing the needs of this environment, decided to convene the National Assembly. The sole task of this National Assembly is to draft a constitution, which is the first step into constitutional governance. Whether constitutional governance can be smoothly implemented in the future depends on the success of this general election for the National Assembly. Why is the sole task of the National Assembly to draft a constitution? Because "the constitution is transferred by the people to themselves," meaning that the National Assembly is convened for the purpose of drafting a constitution. Therefore, the main purpose of the constitution is to stipulate the organization of the nation, uniting the entire Chinese nation into a single entity with an unshakable belief and resolute will to create a Three Principles of the People's rule of law state. In detail, for the sake of external defense, internal peace, public welfare, and the guarantee of progress in future times, we must draft a perfect constitution and jointly abide by it. ⑵ How we elect representatives. Since the task of the National Assembly is so important, we should actively participate in the election of its representatives. However, before the election, we must understand how we should elect representatives. We must understand that this election must accurately reflect the public opinion of the entire nation, ensuring that each representative elected is worthy of their position. Therefore, while we must abide by the provisions of the election law, we must also pay attention to selecting "virtuous and upright" individuals, ensuring that those with morality, learning, and respect in their localities can serve the country. The current National Assembly Representative Election Law only sets a few negative restrictions on the qualifications of candidates (see Articles 5 and 12 regarding the right to vote), in addition to being over 20 years old and a resident of the electoral district. Although there are provisions to prevent election fraud, it may be difficult to achieve the goal of electing capable individuals. This is because election laws can only prevent abuses arising from the election process itself and cannot fulfill the responsibility of selecting virtuous and capable individuals. Therefore, to ensure that each representative attending the assembly fulfills their responsibilities and lives up to the people's trust, we must carefully select the candidates beforehand. Therefore, when we elect, we must have several criteria to determine our choices. Our criteria for election are: (1) Noble character. Because a person without a noble character cannot have pure thoughts or a bright conscience. Even if they are elected as representatives by chance, they will inevitably betray public opinion and lose the respect and trust of society. This would not only be an obstacle to the constitution but also a disgrace to that electoral district. Therefore, noble character is the most important condition for a candidate. (2) Rich knowledge and experience. Knowledge is difficult to define. Some may have read countless books but cannot distinguish between beans and wheat. Here, it simply refers to having specialized knowledge; it does not necessarily require a doctorate or master's degree. Because with knowledge and experience, one can have a thorough understanding and reasonable decision on important issues related to the nation. Therefore, knowledge and experience are essential. (3) Dedication to social welfare. People who are dedicated to public welfare must have a strong sense of responsibility and patience, and they will be able to serve the country with all their might. This is also the most important target of the election. (4) Distinguished revolutionary achievements. This point should not be easily overlooked, and it is not a recommendation for fellow revolutionaries. Because those who have worked hard on the revolutionary front are, to some extent, creators of history. They bear the mission of promoting society, holding a spirit of fierce sacrifice, and seeking the welfare of the social group. This is also our target of choice. From the above points, we can draw a conclusion: that we should carefully and thoughtfully elect representatives according to the above criteria to create a correct and perfect election, so that the overall opinion of the nation can be fully reflected by the assembly. Otherwise, if the election is incorrect, the true intention of the people will inevitably be obscured and distorted by their representatives. As a result, the assembly will not be able to reflect public opinion, and the constitution required by the people will not be produced in the assembly. This will create a conflict between the will of the assembly and the will of the people, and the national representatives will not be able to represent the true intentions of the voters. (Slogans) ⑴ The National Assembly is an important stage for drafting a constitution and entering constitutional governance. ⑵ The National Assembly seeks the common unity of the Chinese nation. ⑶ The National Assembly consolidates the external strength of the Republic of China. ⑷ The National Assembly gathers talents to jointly shoulder the mission of national revival. ⑸ Drafting a constitution is a guarantee of social welfare and progress of the times. ⑹ Drafting a constitution can make the Republic of China a rule of law state based on the Three Principles of the People. ⑺ Convening the National Assembly is the prelude to the people exercising their four powers. ⑻ We must understand the importance of the National Assembly and actively participate in the election. ⑼ We must elect candidates with noble character and dedication to public welfare to be our representatives. ⑽ We must elect candidates with rich knowledge and experience to be our representatives.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangrong Discusses This Year's Yellow River Flood Prevention Work</h3>
<p>Spring Work Completed, Active Flood Prevention Measures in Place, Fundamental Work Planned and Underway</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, recently traveled from Henan to Beijing to attend the National Water Conservancy Conference. After the conference, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing to pay his respects to Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, and Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan, reporting on the recent Yellow River management situation. He is scheduled to return to Beijing and then to Kaifeng today or tomorrow. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency interviewed Kong at his residence yesterday, and he provided detailed information on the recent Yellow River management situation. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Preventing This Year's Yellow River Flood Season</p>
<p>According to Kong, in recent years, the Yellow River has repeatedly breached its banks. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all parties to rescue the situation, more serious disasters have been avoided. This year's flood season has already begun. According to reports from various hydrological stations, the Wei, Jing, Luo, and other tributaries in the upper reaches have all risen. Therefore, the flow at Longmen and Tongguan in the upper reaches has exceeded 4,000 cubic meters per second, causing the flow at Zhongmu and Taochengbu in the lower reaches to increase to 6,000 cubic meters per second. Therefore, this year's flood season has arrived early. All necessary materials and other flood prevention matters are being expedited. All stone materials, etc., have been prepared, with the exception of a portion. To facilitate transportation, a transportation agency has recently been established. The Lanfeng Transportation Office in Dongzhuang has been reorganized into the Materials Transportation Office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, responsible for handling transportation work. Numerous material transportation stations have been established along the north bank of the Yellow River and at Dongba Tou, Dongzhuang, and Luokou to provide convenience. According to my recent inspection of the banks of the Yellow River in Shandong, Hebei, and Henan, the spring flood protection projects have been largely completed. However, the main flood season is approaching, so the construction of preventive projects for the main flood season is actively underway, hoping to ensure safety and stability. As for this year's Yellow River flood prevention funds, I have also discussed this with the authorities in Beijing, and there should be no major problems.</p>
<p>Recent Progress on Fundamental Yellow River Management Work</p>
<p>When asked about the recent progress on fundamental Yellow River management work, the reporter was told that to permanently eliminate Yellow River disasters, it is necessary to manage the river from its source. However, the cost of fundamental management work is too high, and it cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, the implementation of fundamental management work must be carried out in stages. In addition to the work that has already been done in the past, the following projects have recently been planned: ⑴ The first phase of the project to regulate the river channel upstream and downstream of the Pinghan Bridge. ⑵ The first phase of the project to regulate the Tongwaxiang river channel. ⑶ The first phase of the project to build a flood control reservoir in Baoji Gorge on the Wei River. ⑷ The project to improve transportation on both banks of the Yellow River. The total cost of the above first-phase construction projects is estimated to be 3 million yuan. In addition, the large-scale experimental field at Heigangkou has been established and is now actively constructing a demonstration zone to prevent erosion, conducting research to aid the implementation of fundamental management work. Kong concluded by saying that Yellow River management is currently the most difficult water conservancy work in our country. The fundamental solution of this water conservancy problem cannot be achieved in a short period of time or by the talent of a few people. He hopes that people in the country will pay attention and assist in this endeavor.</p>

<h3>Pudong Merchants Bureau New Wharf Fire Causes Over Two Million in Losses</h3>
<p>Fire Spreads from Shed No. 6 to Shed No. 5; Most of the Stored Goods are Dongbei Cotton; Firefighters Fight All Night in a Tense Situation; Both Cargo Owners and the Wharf Had Insurance</p>
<p>The Merchants Bureau's new wharf at Yangjiadu, Pudong, has a total of thirteen sheds. The buildings are nearly forty years old. Near the waterfront, there are eight sheds, each with a depth of 300 feet and a perimeter of 100 feet. All are surrounded by thick brick walls, with huge wooden beams supporting the roofs, which are covered with lead sheets and coated with asphalt. Sheds No. 5 and No. 6 were filled with large quantities of Dongbei cotton, shipped from Lianyungang by Renhe and other cotton firms via the Merchants Bureau's Northern Seas steamers. Shed No. 5 contained over 5,000 bales of machine-picked cotton (i.e., foreign cotton), and Shed No. 6 held 4,900 bales of loose cotton. In addition, the rear of Shed No. 5 contained over 8,000 bags of white rice, yellow grain, and other miscellaneous grains belonging to Xiedaheng, Xinfeng, and several dozen other rice merchants. Therefore, both sheds were fully loaded. Yesterday, Sheds No. 7 and No. 8 were being used by the bureau's chartered steamer Yong'an, which was unloading rice from Jiujiang, and workers were even working overtime last night. Sheds No. 5 and No. 6, however, had no cargo being loaded or unloaded all day. As usual, the shed supervisor opened the shed doors at 7:00 a.m. and closed them at 5:00 p.m. After finishing work, the staff had already returned home. Unexpectedly, at around 8:20 p.m. last night, while workers in Shed No. 7 were unloading cargo, thick smoke suddenly billowed from the windows and cracks of Shed No. 6. Soon after, flames raged fiercely. The night-shift staff of the shed immediately reported the fire and urgently telegraphed various agencies for assistance. However, cotton is extremely flammable, and the flames quickly pierced the roof, soaring high into the sky, creating a red glow that illuminated the area like daylight. It could be seen even from ten miles away. The Pudong Fire Brigade, led by Director Zhao, arrived with three fire engines to put out the fire. Following them were two fire engines from the Yangjiadu Fire Brigade, two fire engines from the Yangjing District Fire Brigade, and the Customs Pujit Fireboat. Even the fire brigades from the southwestern and eastern districts of Shanghai sent pump engines via ferry to Pudong to assist, mooring at the wharf. The Yong'an steamer, docked at the same wharf, sounded its whistle wildly. The situation was extremely tense. Yang, the head of the Yangjiabo police station in charge, and Xu, the head of the security force, along with the fourth team of the security force, dispatched police officers to the scene to maintain order. However, the fire burned more and more fiercely. After an hour, the wooden beams on the roof of Shed No. 5 caught fire in succession. The asphalt on the lead roof, scorched by the flames, melted and dripped onto the cotton inside the shed. As a result, the fire in Shed No. 5 became uncontrollable, its intensity matching that of Shed No. 6. Therefore, although dozens of hoses poured countless amounts of water onto the two cargo sheds, they could not quell the fire even slightly. In the end, it was fortunate that Sheds No. 4 and No. 7 on either side were able to be saved. The fire burned until late at night at 12:00 a.m. By then, the two sheds, including the outer gatehouse of Shed No. 5, were completely destroyed, and the fire gradually subsided. However, because the interior was still burning fiercely, firefighters would continue to put out the fire all night. The losses from this fire were enormous. Each bale of loose cotton in Shed No. 6 was worth over one hundred yuan, resulting in a total loss of over six hundred thousand yuan. Each bale of machine-picked cotton in Shed No. 5 was worth over two hundred yuan, resulting in a total loss of over one million yuan. In addition, over 8,000 bags of white rice, worth about ten yuan per bag, were lost, totaling over eighty thousand yuan. The two sheds, which had been built for forty or fifty years, were worth about twenty thousand yuan. The estimated total loss was nearly two million yuan, truly an unprecedented catastrophe. It is said that the cargo owners and the shed owners had considerable fire insurance. The shed staff has telegraphed the shed manager, Zhang Zihou, to return to the shed overnight to discuss how to handle the aftermath. The head office has also sent Section Chief Zhong to cross the river to investigate. However, according to those familiar with the shed's interior, although there are as many as thirteen sheds, there is no fire-fighting equipment. Moreover, tap water is now available in Pudong, but the hydrants are too far away, and the bureau has never connected to the water supply, making fire-fighting difficult when a fire breaks out. When this reporter left the fire scene at 0:30 a.m. this morning, the fire was still intensifying. According to the firefighters, they were prepared to work through the night.</p>
<h3>The Oppressive Heat Still Fierce in This City</h3>
<p>Although There Was a Shower at Noon, the Temperature Still Reached 97 Degrees; The Number of Epidemic Patients is Increasing Rapidly</p>

Although there was a shower yesterday at noon, the oppressive heat did not dissipate. The reporter from Datong News Agency hereby records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>The Heat Has Not Abated</p>
<p>This city has recently been plagued by heat waves. The midday temperature has been above 90 degrees every day. The oppressive heat is intense, and it is difficult to find ways to escape it. The heat was especially severe the day before yesterday, with the highest temperature rising to 99.3 degrees, setting the highest record for extreme heat this year. Although there was a shower yesterday at noon, it lasted only thirty minutes. After the rain, the scorching sun still hung high, and the highest temperature also rose to 97.5 degrees.</p>
<p>Patients Increasing</p>
<p>The number of epidemic patients is increasing rapidly due to the intense heat of recent days. The day before yesterday, 333 people sought medical attention at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road (264 men and 69 women), and 73 were hospitalized. As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, nearly 300 patients had sought medical attention. By midnight, the number will likely be no less than the day before yesterday. If this extreme heat continues unabated, the health of the residents will be severely threatened.</p>
<h3>Instigator of Violence at Shanghai Dance Hall Surrenders</h3>
<p>Sentenced to 30 Days of Detention</p>
<p>A brawl occurred at the Shanghai Dance Hall at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road on the night of the 19th of last month. At the time, nine suspects, including Sun Xianglin and Zhou Yongfu, were arrested and sent to the Special Court No. 1. It was learned that the arrested individuals were all workers of the British American Tobacco Company. The cause of the fight was the instigation by Chen Kefu, an employee of the company. In addition to punishing Sun Xianglin and others separately, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Chen Kefu. Now, Chen Kefu suddenly surrendered himself to the police station the day before yesterday and was immediately taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 1. Zhang Shizhu, the police lawyer, prosecuted him according to law. When questioned, Chen Kefu claimed that his name was Chen Qiufi and that there was no Chen Kefu in the British American Tobacco Company. He denied instigating the fight and hired attorney Fan Zhu to defend him. Judge Pan ruled that Chen Kefu, also known as Chen Qiufi, was guilty of instigating damage and sentenced him to 30 days of detention. If he chooses to pay a fine in lieu of detention, it will be calculated at two yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Aunt and Sister-in-Law Abducted Together; Two-Year Legal Battle Ends with Order for Investigation and Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>The Aunt Has Returned, But There Is No News of the Sister-in-Law; Wang Youxin and Two Others Are Suspected</p>
<p>Yan Xu, a local woman, 40 years old, used to run the Dingtai Flour and Noodle Shop at No. 1236 Caojiadu. She had a daughter, Yan A'mei, 22 years old, and a son, Yan Xinfa, 20 years old. The daughter was unmarried, and the son had married Ma Sanmei. On March 25th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, when Yan A'mei and Ma Sanmei were both under 20 years old, the aunt and sister-in-law were abducted simultaneously. In May of the same year, A'mei returned, but Sanmei did not. According to A'mei, it was Chen Cao, a Jiangyin woman who used to be a maid in their house, who acted as the go-between, and Zhang Yunyi, a mechanic from the Toyota Mill, who helped send them to Wang Youxin, the head of the mechanics at the Toyota Mill in Qingdao (38 years old, from Tiantai, with family in Shanghai). It was a double play. Sanmei was later abducted and hidden by Wang Youxin. Yan Xu and others filed a complaint with the local court, but Wang Youxin denied the facts, only saying that the two women came to Qingdao and were ill. He had borrowed 300 yuan from them due to their neighborly relationship and had written two IOUs. The case dragged on for two years through three trials. It has now been ruled that the private prosecution was inappropriate and has been changed to an investigation by the prosecutor of the original court, with Wang Youxin, Zhang Yunyi, and Chen Cao all suspected of abduction and jointly prosecuted publicly. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing held a court hearing. Wang Youxin continued to deny everything as before. Yan A'mei testified that she currently lives on Yidingpan Road and had graduated from elementary school. In the past, a maid named Chen Cao introduced her sister-in-law, Ma Sanmei, saying that Wang Youxin was a good and wealthy man and was now in Qingdao. Her sister-in-law wanted her to go with her. On the 25th of the month in the 24th year of the Republic of China, because of an argument with her mother, the aunt and sister-in-law went out, and Zhang Yunyi picked them up by car and took them to Room 11 of the Huadong Apartment in the French Concession. Then, they took the Yisheng steamer to Qingdao and opened Room 7 of the Zhonghua Hotel. That day, they went to the Toyota Mill and found Wang Youxin. Wang took them to the Zhonghua Hotel. That night, Zhang slept alone, and she, Ma Sanmei, and Wang Youxin slept in the same bed. When asked how she could agree to that, she replied that he had lied to her that he had no wife and that they would live together first and then go to Tiantai to get married. When asked about Ma Sanmei, she replied that she and Wang were already in love. About four or five days later, they moved to the Toyota Mill dormitory. After living there for a few days, they moved back to the Zhonghua Hotel, Room 13. After living there for more than ten days, because the expenses were too high and Zhang Yunyi had found a job, they moved to Room 27 of the New Zhonghua Hotel. When asked if she had borrowed 300 yuan from him, she replied no. Because he had told her to go to Tiantai first, but to transfer in Shanghai, he said he was afraid that her mother would sue him, so he drafted it and told her to write it accordingly. She didn't want to write it, but he threatened her with a gun, so she wrote it. After she and Ma Sanmei came to Shanghai, they went to her grandmother's house, and Wang Youxin returned to Tiantai. When he didn't see them go to Tiantai, he came to Shanghai to investigate her grandmother's house and took Sanmei away, never to return. He told her to leave, but she didn't want to, so she temporarily lived in the Bailian Nunnery in Jiangwan. That was in May. At this point, the official questioned Zhang Yunyi, 28 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 391 Meibaike Road. Wang Youxin was his uncle, and Chen Cao was a maid in Wang's family. The year before last, he went to Qingdao to look for business and visited his uncle. Chen Cao said that Ma Sanmei and Yan A'mei also wanted to go to Qingdao to find work, so they went together, and there was no affair. At this point, when asked, Chen Cao testified that she had worked in the Yan's house for a month and then went to work in Wang Youxin's house. Wang Youxin's mother-in-law was a neighbor of the Yan's family. Yan A'mei called Wang's wife "Mum". She had never brought them together; it was a false accusation. At this point, the plaintiff, Yan Xinfa, testified that Ma Sanmei was his wife and had been abducted by Wang. At this point, Yan Xu testified that after her daughter and daughter-in-law left, she had reported it to the police station. On the fifth day of the fifth month, Wang Youxin came and said that Yan A'mei had returned to Shanghai and was at her grandmother's house and claimed that he had lent her 300 yuan, so she went to get it back, but Sanmei was not there. She also hired attorney Zhang Jie to file a private prosecution. The court adjourned for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Argument Over Cooling Off Leads to Fatal Fight</h3>
<p>Autopsy Results Show Cause of Death Unknown; Dai Tingyuan's Body Awaits Autopsy</p>
<p>You Wenlong, a small tailor from Yangzhou, 20 years old, worked at the Wang Senji Tailor Shop at No. 298 Kunming Road. He was very close to Dai Tingyuan (37 years old), a fellow townsman and tailor at the Deji Tailor Shop at No. 113, Lane 1134, Dongyouheng Road. Recently, Dai introduced him to the Sun Deji boss to help make clothes. At 8:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, Dai returned to the shop from bathing somewhere and saw that You Wenlong was still working, making a pair of pants. Dai told him to stop and go outside to cool off, but he refused, leading to a quarrel. They cursed each other as "pigs" and grabbed each other's hair. You, being young and strong, took the opportunity to push Dai to the ground. Unexpectedly, Dai lost consciousness and was on the verge of death. You immediately reported to the beat patrolman and called an ambulance to take Dai Tingyuan to the Sacred Heart Hospital at No. 41 Ningguo Road, where he died after treatment failed. You Wenlong was arrested by the police and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated the case and requested that You Wenlong be detained pending the coroner's examination of Dai Tingyuan's cause of death. When questioned, You stated that he had no feud with Dai and that he had pushed him down in a moment of anger without hitting him. He also said that he was an old smoker and suffered from stomach problems, requesting a review. Judge Xiao Xiefei ruled to remand him in custody pending clarification of Dai's cause of death. At around 10:00 a.m., the court commissioned Prosecutor Tang to go to the autopsy room on Feilun Road to examine the body, questioning the defendant, as well as the witness, Sun Deji, and the deceased's wife, Ms. Wu. It was concluded that the cause of death of the deceased, Dai Tingyuan, was unknown and approved for an autopsy. After the autopsy, the body was released to his wife, Dai Wu, for burial.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry Sends Councilor Chen to Court</p>
<p>The case of speculation and manipulation at the Cotton Yarn Exchange, requested by the Ministry of Industry to be investigated by the First Special District Court of this city, opened in court the other day. Because the defendants Wu Qiding and Sheng Shengyi did not arrive, only Kuang Yunwen, the first section chief of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, appeared in court to make a statement, and Wen Lanting, the standing director of the Cotton Yarn Exchange, and others surrendered themselves for questioning. There were no results, so it was decided to continue the court investigation at 9:00 a.m. this morning.

<h3>Loss of One Yuan Leads to Death of a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Zhou Yi, a Suzhou native residing at No. 12, Chengyu Lane, Lafeide Road, French Concession, 46 years old, runs the Longhua Sock Factory at No. 52 Shikan Lane, Xiafei Road. Because he has no children, he adopted a daughter named Meimei in her early years, who is 13 years old this year. The Zhou couple love her dearly, sending her to school in the hope of cultivating her to rely on in the future. The girl is currently resting at home due to summer vacation. At 11:00 a.m. on the 7th, Meimei entered the room of Qiu Yao, a Ningbo woman (23 years old) renting a room in the pavilion, to chat. Soon after, Qiu Yao discovered that a one-yuan banknote was missing. She thought that no one else had entered the room, only Meimei, the daughter of the second landlord, had come to chat, so she suspected the girl of stealing it. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, she complained to the girl's father, Zhou Yi. Zhou then reprimanded his daughter, saying that she should not enter other people's rooms for no reason, causing suspicion. The girl felt unjustly accused and had a sudden thought. At 11:00 a.m., she found raw opium ash and swallowed it to commit suicide. At 2:30 p.m., the poison took effect. After someone found out, they immediately called Zhou home, who took her by car to Renji Hospital for treatment, but she died at 4:30 p.m. The hospital reported it to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall for autopsy, pending a request to the Second Special Court for an official to examine it this morning.</p>

<h3>International Eccentric Monk Zhao Kong Travels Busily Between Tianjin and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Also Leads Male and Female Disciples to Tianjin; Unable to Cross the Sea by Sailing Boat</p>
<p>Zhao Kong, a foreign monk (a Hungarian who became a monk in China) who had a lawsuit with a certain Russian newspaper in this city a few years ago and did not admit to being an eccentric monk, was introduced by a Buddhist organization in this city to Tianjin last year and was welcomed by various Buddhist organizations in Tianjin. Later, Zhao Kong returned to Shanghai in the winter of last year and established himself on Daxi Road. It is now known that Zhao Kong left Shanghai for Tianjin again last week with six of his foreign male and female disciples. It is said that he is going to propagate Buddhism and will return to Shanghai soon.

<h3>Procuress Takes in Country Girl as Daughter-in-Law and Sells Her into a Brothel</h3>
<p>Suddenly Meets Relatives While Soliciting Customers; Letters Father to Shanghai to Report and Arrest Her</p>
<p>Wu Hongbao, from Dijiang, Huzhou, made a living as a boatman. He had a daughter named Lan Ying, 17 years old. In January of this year, he was introduced by his fellow townsman, Yang Amao, who said that there was a Changzhou woman named Qiu Laosan who ran a cigarette paper shop in Shanghai. Her son, Xilin, wanted to marry Lan Ying as his wife. At that time, it was stated that the betrothal gift was 80 yuan. Lan Ying was taken to Shanghai by Qiu from Huzhou to choose an auspicious day for the wedding. However, on January 16th, Lan Ying was taken by Qiu to her home at No. 14 Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road, Shanghai. Qiu was actually a procuress who ran a brothel, and her recognition of Lan Ying as her daughter-in-law was a trick. Therefore, three days after arriving in Shanghai, she sold Lan Ying to the brothel run by Ge Laowu at No. 8 and a half, Lane 30, Zhibu Road for 230 yuan and forced her into prostitution. Although Lan Ying resisted at the time, she had no choice but to obey because she could not endure the punishment. Lan Ying was originally a pure country girl and has since suffered physical and mental torment. Recently, while soliciting customers on the streets of Zhibu Road, Wu suddenly met her relative, Xia Asan, and told him everything. Xia sent a letter to the girl's father, Wu Hongbao, who rushed to Shanghai after receiving the letter and reported it to the Lao Zha police station. Chinese Detective Yang Chengcai first arrested Qiu Laosan, and then continued to arrest Ge Laowu, who had already fled after hearing the news, but the girl was found. Yesterday morning, Qiu was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated the case, prosecuting her under Article 240 of the Criminal Code and requesting severe punishment according to law. Wu Hongbao and Wu Lan Ying then submitted a detailed account of what happened. When questioned, Qiu Laosan completely denied it, saying that she did not know the Wu father and daughter and that she had never recognized Lan Ying as her daughter-in-law. She claimed that it was a false accusation. The presiding judge of the Criminal Court, Qian Hongye, reviewed the confession and ruled that the case be adjourned for one week for investigation of evidence and then further questioning.</p>

<h3>Boatman Falls into River and Dies; Wife Denies Murder</h3>
<p>Court Hearing Adjourned for Further Trial</p>
<p>Boatman Ma Shifa made a living on the water. His wife, Ma Xing (26 years old, from Shandong), lived on the boat with her husband. However, she was lewd by nature and committed adultery with Zhu Yongjiang (30 years old), a fellow townsman in the same profession. Driven by lust, they plotted to make it permanent. They conspired with Zhu to push Ma Shifa into the Huangpu River and drown him on April 24th of this year at the buoy No. 34 and 35 in the Huangpu River. The Water Patrol Police recovered the body and investigated the situation, arresting Ma Xing and Zhu Yongjiang and charging them with murdering her husband. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongyue held a court hearing. Ma Xing testified that on April 24th of this year, her boat was docked at the Pudong Egg Factory. That night at 8:00 p.m., her husband told her to row to Yangjing, Pudong, when the tide rose. At that time, her husband went to sleep in the cabin. When she woke up, it was already 12:00 a.m. She rowed to buoy No. 34 and 35, when a large ship came and collided with her boat, causing it to sink. Her husband was rescued by the large ship. She cried for help, and the Water Patrol Police came to rescue her. Unexpectedly, the large ship disappeared. Eight days later, her husband's body was suddenly discovered. She said she knew nothing about it and denied having an affair with Zhu Yongjiang. When questioned, Zhu Yongjiang also denied everything, saying that he had quarreled with Ma and was being wrongly accused. Police officer No. 9155 testified that he had heard a woman crying for help that day and went to investigate and found it was the woman. The court hearing was adjourned for further trial.</p>

<h3>Apprentice Blows Flute to Raise Alarm; Bandits Flee in Panic</h3>
<p>No Losses for Ruiyu Tobacco and Paper Shop; Bullet Strikes Uniform of Night Watchman</p>
<p>Ruiyu Tobacco and Paper Shop, located at No. 70 Renyuan Lane, Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, is owned by a Ningbo native named Han Ruixin. Due to its thriving business and annual profits, it attracted the covetous eyes of bandits. Yesterday at noon, while the shop assistants were having lunch, four bandits wearing Xiangyun gauze and blue short-sleeved shirts and trousers suddenly appeared. They carried three handguns; two bandits, each holding a gun, stood guard at the entrance, while the other two, each with a gun, stormed inside. Because the counter was surrounded by iron bars, they broke into the shop through a side door. They grabbed the shop owner and claimed they needed help. However, in their haste and confusion, they failed to notice the movements of people in and out of the shop. An apprentice seized the opportunity to escape upstairs and frantically blew a police whistle, shouting "Robbers!" The passersby in the street, hearing the noise, began to make an uproar, yelling "Robbers!" The bandits, seeing the clamor outside and hearing the incessant shouts, did not have time to loot and fled in panic. As one bandit fled to Guangyu Lane on Jiale Road, Jin Fulin, the night watchman of the lane, stood up from his chair. The bandit, suspecting that he was being apprehended, drew his handgun and fired a shot, the bullet passing through the corner of the watchman's uniform. He then fired another shot into the air and fled without a trace. After the French General Police Station received the report, a large number of detectives were dispatched in patrol cars to search for the bandits, but they were unable to find them. Later, a suspect wearing Xiangyun gauze shirts and trousers was apprehended in front of No. 27 Tingyun Lane on Lafayette Road and taken back to the police station for investigation. Ruiyu Tobacco and Paper Shop suffered no financial losses, only a fright, which could be considered fortunate.</p>
<h3>Someone Snores on the Bed</h3>
<p>Husband's Income Meager; Wife Brings Lover Home</p>
<p>Cheng Luosong, an 18-year-old native of Anhui, works as a clerk at Kousheng Garden in Penglai Market. He married Cheng Zhou, a 19-year-old woman who is plump and wobbly. They live at No. 32 Wuyuan Road, behind Yeshi Garden. However, Cheng Luosong is just a small shop assistant with a meager income, which is not enough for the wife's extravagance. She began to frequent the Fuan Company Amusement Park in Xiaodongmen. In May of this year, she met Wang Yongquan, a Suzhou native (26 years old, residing at No. 25 Dunren Lane, Lanwei'ai Road). After several romantic encounters at a hotel, they found it too expensive. Therefore, on the evening of the 27th of this month, the wife invited the lover to her home for illicit relations. She assumed that her husband was staying at the shop and there was nothing to worry about. Unexpectedly, at dawn on the 28th, Cheng Luosong returned home to check and found Wang Yongquan and Cheng Zhou sleeping in the same bed. He immediately called the police, who took them into custody at the local court on charges of adultery. Yesterday, Judge Chen presided over the trial. Cheng Luosong hired lawyer Wang Liwu and filed a civil suit, seeking compensation totaling 1,400 yuan for the loss of reputation and mental distress. The judge questioned Cheng Zhou, who confessed that Cheng Luosong was her husband and they had been married for three years, always living together. In May of this year, he said he had no money to spend, so she rented a house with her girlfriends. He worked as a clerk at Kousheng Garden in Penglai Market and stayed at the shop at night, not returning home. Because her husband did not care about her livelihood, she started an affair with Wang Yongquan. She met him while playing at the Fuan Amusement Park. At first, she struck up a conversation with Wang, and he did not know she was married, so they often met at hotels. After several times, she asked him to come to her house at night, and he paid her 10 yuan per month. At that time, she said she had no husband to deceive him and get some money. It was true that on June 28th, they were caught by her husband. Wang Yongquan testified that he met Cheng Zhou while watching a show at the Fuan Company. She said she had no husband, so he started a relationship with her, first having illicit relations in a hotel on Lafayette Road. More than ten days later, he stayed at her house twice. On June 28th, he was caught by her husband and did not know she had a husband. He paid her 10 yuan per month. Cheng Luosong testified that he had been married to Cheng Zhou for three years. They used to live together in Wujia Lane. Since June 7th, he had been staying at the shop. His mother said she was going to her mother's home in the countryside. Later, friends told him that his wife was not behaving properly, so he caught them in the act on the morning of June 28th. He did not want her anymore and asked for the law to take action. Upon hearing this, the wife immediately said to her husband, "I won't do it again, spare me this time," begging for forgiveness. After lawyer Wang persuaded him, he withdrew part of the suit against the wife. The part of the suit against Wang was concluded after court examination, and the verdict will be announced on the 12th.</p>

Yesterday, news came from the Shanghai Local Court that the Jiangsu High Court did not pronounce the sentence on the 6th. The presiding judge of the case announced the revocation of the debate conclusion because further investigation of evidence was still needed, and a new debate would be reopened at a later date.</p>
<h3>Woman Suing for Identity Confirmation Does Not Appear in Court</h3>
<p>Lu Wu and Yu Shaoqing Sued; Court Concludes One-Sided Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Lu Guanzeng, a wealthy man from Tianguanfang, Suzhou, has two pawnshops in Shanghai, Yuchang Yuanli. Recently, a woman named Lu Zhengkun initially petitioned the First Special Court to summon Lu Wu, the mother of Lu Guanzeng, and Yu Shaoqing, the former general manager of Yuchang Pawnshop, to mediate and confirm that she was their daughter. However, Lu Zhengkun did not appear in court when the hearing was held, resulting in unsuccessful mediation. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Now, Lu Zhengkun has filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court against Lu Wu and Yu Shaoqing, seeking confirmation of her identity. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Fuji presided over the hearing in Civil Court No. 13. Lu Wu and Yu Shaoqing hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Wang Fushang to appear in court, while Lu Zhengkun again failed to appear, only submitting a statement to the court claiming she was ill due to accumulated worries and unable to attend. Lawyers Wu and Wang immediately stated that the so-called Lu Zhengkun simply did not exist. Her statement contained no mention of the name of her illness or the hospital where she was receiving treatment, clearly indicating a deliberate attempt to delay the lawsuit. Her claim was merely aimed at extortion. Therefore, they requested permission for a one-sided debate and a judgment. The court granted this request, and Lawyers Wu and Wang presented various reasons for dismissing the plaintiff's claim. The court then announced the conclusion of the hearing and scheduled the pronouncement of the verdict.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun Out of Danger</h3>
<p>Trip to Mount Lu Terminated</p>
<p>Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, suffered from neurasthenia and went to Baohua Temple in Dachang on June 17th for recuperation. On the evening of the 2nd of this month, while watching fish in the release pond, he suddenly had a stroke. His attendants, Wu Bikang and Wang Youyuan, supported him to prevent him from falling. After rushing him to Shanghai for treatment by Chinese and Western doctors, his condition gradually improved and he was out of danger. Yesterday, Wang Youyuan told reporters that Li's illness was caused by excessive labor in recent days. Because he was bored and lonely in the temple, he was accompanied by Zhang Mingjing, the Magistrate of Baoshan County, to visit scenic spots in Baoshan and Wusong. The excessive travel led to his illness. On doctor's orders, he will continue to recuperate in Baohua Temple for the time being. His planned trip to Mount Lu on the 7th of this month was also terminated due to illness. He will reschedule his trip after he fully recovers.</p>
<h3>Those Invited to Lushan Talks from This City Will Depart Soon</h3>
<p>More Than Twenty People Invited to Participate</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Wang Jingwei have invited more than 200 academic and community leaders from across the country to Mount Lu for talks to discuss ideological and academic issues. It is learned that the invitees from this city include Huang Renzhi, He Bingsong, Zhu Qinglai, Hu Zhengzhi, Zhang Jiluan, Li Haoran, Zhu Xinong, and Li Zhaohuan, among others, totaling more than twenty people. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency met with Huang Renzhi yesterday. According to him, he has decided to take a ship to Mount Lu on the 10th to participate. Most of the other invitees, except for a small number who have already gone to Mount Lu, are scheduled to take ships to Mount Lu on the 10th or 11th.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Seeks Aid for Fujian Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, Fujian Province has been plagued by continuous rain and torrential floods, reaching record high levels and causing severe flood disasters in the provincial capital and various counties. Many residents have drowned, and losses are extremely heavy. The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at No. 97 Renji Road received a letter yesterday from the Fujian Shanghai Fellow Association, and representatives Zhu Yuanyuan, Chi Hualong, and Zhuang Dingli came to the association to report on the disaster and request relief. The original letter is as follows: "Our province's capital and more than 40 townships in southwestern Minhou County have been hit by floods as many as six times in the past month. Fields and gardens have been submerged, houses have been washed away, livestock have been almost completely lost, and lives have been lost. The severity of the disaster breaks the record of Fujian flood disasters in the past century. Our association has received numerous letters and telegrams from disaster-stricken communities and victims seeking help. We hereby appeal for large sums of money to be allocated to assist in disaster relief and save the people of Fujian from starvation." It is heard that the association is exhausted from handling droughts in various provinces. Unexpectedly, before the drought is over, flood disasters are frequently reported, causing deep anxiety. However, most overseas Chinese are from this province and have always been dedicated to raising funds to help when disaster strikes any province in the country. It is hoped that all kind-hearted people from all walks of life will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance and come together to help the province in this tragic disaster.</p>

<h3>Research on the National Assembly and Women's Political Participation</h3>
<p>— Hu Lan</p>
<p>Since the Standing Committee and the Legislative Yuan successively revised the National Assembly Organization Law and the National Assembly Representative Election Law, and scheduled the National Assembly to convene on November 12th this year, it seems that only the election and designation of representatives remain to be carried out, and other preparations are simple and easy to promote. However, in reality, there are still issues that need to be discussed, such as the issue of women representatives, which is an important one. The assembly has 260 ex officio representatives, 1,200 elected representatives, and 240 designated representatives, totaling 1,700 representatives. With so many representatives gathering together, how many women, who account for more than half of the national population, will obtain the qualifications to attend as representatives is still unknown. In today's countries with universal politics, the slogans of women's liberation, women's political participation, and equal treatment are being shouted, which cannot be ignored. In the preliminary elections of the National Assembly, candidates for district elections and occupational elections have been produced in accordance with the National Assembly Representative Election Law. However, it is found that none of the candidates elected in the preliminary elections in various provinces include women. This matter concerns the fundamental plan of the country and goes against the true essence of gender equality. The amended oath of the National Assembly stipulates that "I represent the people of the Republic of China, accept the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, and exercise my powers in accordance with the law." However, Article 12 of the Kuomintang's platform formulated by Mr. Sun, stipulates, "Confirm the principle of gender equality in law, economy, education, and society, and promote the development of women's rights." The National Assembly Election Law does not have any gender restrictions. Why are the representatives of the 200 million women of our country uniquely absent? Is this because our women have voluntarily given up, or are they being monopolized and manipulated by men? Or is it that society is stuck in the old ways, considering women to be insignificant and without the qualifications to elect and be elected? In other countries, such as England, the right of women to participate in politics was established before the European War. After the European War, due to women's special contributions during the international war, women were granted the legal right to elect and be elected. In France, since the French Revolution in 1789, there have been female heroes such as Madame Roland and Lonfge Leeombe fighting for political power, expressing women's rights, and advocating freedom of speech, saying, "Since women have the right to go to the guillotine, they certainly have the right to speak on the podium." In order to resist the "Declaration of the Rights of Man" (LedroftdeI’homme) published by the National Assembly at that time, they were unfortunately sacrificed for the political power of the women's world under the oppression and violence of a male-centered society. Up to now, the House of Commons has acknowledged that women have equal rights to participate in politics. In the United States, in August 1920, Secretary of State Kalban issued a proclamation stating that "the federal government, or any federal state, shall not deny or hinder the right of the people of the United States to vote on the basis of gender." American women were then guaranteed the right to participate in politics. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>The Time to Resist Japan Has Arrived</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said that we are not anti-Japanese, but resist Japan. I am afraid the time has arrived.</p>
<p>The time to resist Japan is now. According to a telegram from Beiping yesterday, at 11:00 PM, military officer Matsui told the authorities by telephone that a Japanese company was conducting a military exercise at Lugou Bridge last night. Suddenly, gunshots were heard. When the troops were assembled, one soldier was missing. It was believed that the soldier who fired the shot had entered the city, and demanded that troops be immediately led into the city to search, etc.</p>
<p>Our side considered that the entry of Japanese soldiers into the city late at night would cause local unrest. Our troops at Lugou Bridge did not leave the city all day yesterday. We politely refused, saying that the shot was definitely not fired by our side.</p>
<p>Matsui then telephoned again, saying that if our side did not allow it, their side would surround and advance with force. At that time, the Japanese army had taken the form of surrounding and advancing on Wanping County. Therefore, our side and the Japanese side agreed to jointly send personnel to investigate. Unexpectedly, while negotiations were underway, gunshots were heard outside the east gate, but our army did not return fire. Soon after, cannon and machine gun fire was heard continuously outside the west gate.</p>
<p>Based on the above news, it is fully demonstrated that the Japanese side is using excuses to provoke incidents and mobilize troops, which is undoubtedly a strong and organized and planned act of aggression. Under these circumstances, do we have any room for retreat?</p>
<p>The Japanese side often conducts military exercises in Beiping, Tianjin, and other places, regardless of location, day or night, whether it is airplanes or cannons. Their show of force has long been commonplace. In order to settle matters peacefully and maintain peace, our side has never taken effective measures to restrain them. Not only do our people know this, but also the enlightened people on the Japanese side, and even all countries in the world know it. Today, after a night battle during the exercise, they suddenly want to enter the city to search on the pretext of a missing soldier. This incident is the same obvious mechanical operation as the Zangben Incident, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Assuming that the Japanese side had no intention of aggression and no overall plan, why did gunshots break out outside the east gate while both sides were sending personnel to negotiate? Our army did not return fire, and cannon and machine gun fire continued incessantly outside the west gate. At that time, the Japanese army had taken the form of surrounding Wanping County. This is clearly a planned and organized act of aggression by the Japanese side. Under such circumstances, it can truly be said that this is the ancient saying that what is tolerable is intolerable.</p>
<p>The situation in North China has already become abnormal. Because our country loves peace and endures for the sake of peace, we are determined not to settle this bad debt with them before we completely break with them. In the current situation, can we continue to endure it? Can we continue to wipe our faces and swallow our anger? Can we still consider it a local incident and temporarily retreat in order to restore it in the future?</p>
<p>We are resisting Japan, not rejecting Japan. This is the time, this is the time.</p>

<h3>The Delusion Should End</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Since the fall of Bilbao, the arrogance of the Spanish rebels has become more and more rampant, and the behind-the-scenes assistance to the rebels has become more and more openly exposed. According to recent reports, the Non-Intervention Committee will not only have so-called "compromise plans" in order to "leave room for maneuver," but the leader of the rebels has also openly issued notes to various countries, demanding that the rebels be recognized as belligerent parties: "If various countries refuse this request, then when we determine international economic policy in the future, we will uniformly impose a 'closed door' policy on those countries that have expressed ill will towards us, and they should not be surprised at that time."</p>
<p>Using coercion and inducement will be ineffective if applied to a country that values right and wrong over interests. However, current international relations are clearly not like that. Although Britain and France are determined to maintain the West Coast surveillance plan, for the sake of immediate interests and because the arrogance of the rebels is too hot to handle, it seems that they will probably bow their heads again before the powerful and the so-called "compromise plan" to leave room for maneuver will be put into practice, right? And recognizing the rebels as belligerent parties is at most just a matter of time. If the behind-the-scenes puppeteers are more blatant, if the rebels can maintain or even increase their current arrogance.</p>
<p>It is useless to lament such things, because there are too many past examples. When the "civilized" Italian army was "infusing civilization" into "barbaric Abyssinia," wasn't this the same thing that happened? And now, even the Ethiopian delegation at the League of Nations can only voluntarily request not to attend. After too many similar experiences, lamenting should be eliminated, either stimulated to numbness and becoming an escape, or letting hatred take root in the heart and clenching the teeth to do it!</p>
<p>What about Spain? Franco's "report" to Hitler said, "...The war in Spain cannot be sustained until this winter, because once the cold arrives, the morale of the National Army will be low and it will be difficult to fight. Therefore, we must end the war before the arrival of winter at all costs. If so, then we must have 125,000 fresh troops, 500 aircraft, 50 artillery teams, and multiple tanks to be sufficient. ..." According to a reporter from the "Shijie Bao," Germany and Italy actually received this report, so they recently advocated canceling naval surveillance so that various materials can be quickly used to reinforce the Spanish National Army and block all coasts in the territory of the Spanish government. (See the Central Paris Havas dispatch on the 6th) On the other hand, from the documentary film "Spain in Flames," we know how bravely the people of Spain are fighting the rebels in bloody battles. They do not even hesitate to turn every house where their property is deposited into a trench, and even the children are digging trenches for the government army, which is also for themselves!</p>
<p>From this clear comparison, we can see who the final victory will belong to. And from the lessons of blood, the Spanish people have already kicked away lamenting, buried hatred in their hearts, and are clenching their teeth to do it!</p>
<p>Let's turn around and look at ourselves. It has been more than five years since the loss of the three northeastern provinces. The so-called "specialization of North China" that exists in name only is now being pushed tighter, using every trick to ignite the flames of war in North China, wanting to repeat a "September 18th Incident." When the extra editions of the newspapers bring news of the "conflict" in the Fengtai and Lugou Bridge areas caused by Japanese provocations, compatriots, what are your feelings? Is it powerless lamenting? Or "rather be a shattered jade," preparing to do something?</p>
<p>The delusion should end! Victory is in our hands, and it is up to us to create it.</p>
<h3>Random Jottings from Rural Life</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>Our Country's System of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Every summer, I have to move once, which has become a habit. Luckily, my light belongings only require three rickshaws to move everything cleanly and auspiciously. Summer is always best spent in the countryside, where rent is cheap, with small bridges and flowing water, which can also help escape the heat. I don't have a fixed job, and I'm too lazy to move around in the hot weather, so I enjoy some peace and quiet. However, when I moved here this year, I encountered a difficult problem that I had never encountered or even thought of before, which was quite perplexing.</p>
<p>Because the landlord is also a thrifty person and doesn't hire a maid, the next morning after moving in, I hesitated for a long time about the problem of buying groceries. The landlady really didn't expect that this new tenant was not as rich as other college students (many college students rent off-campus here) and could afford to go to restaurants; and the new tenant was too embarrassed to ask them to buy groceries right away. It wasn't until almost noon that I plucked up the courage to borrow a basket and scales from the landlord to go to the market, which surprised them greatly. At first, they insisted on inviting me to have a meal at their place, but because I refused, they readily agreed to do it for me from the next day, for which I am immensely grateful. I thanked them and went out.</p>
<p>Although I can cook a few dishes myself, I am completely ignorant when it comes to buying groceries. Country people are honest everywhere, but when they see someone wearing Western trousers buying groceries, they also know they can take advantage a little. It looked like the vegetable stalls were about to close, but when I asked the prices, they were still very expensive, and I couldn't do that haggling trick of adding up copper coins one by one, so of course I was bound to suffer. But misfortune never comes singly. Not only was I charged high prices, but they also said that my scale was based on 24 liang per jin (catty). I don't know if the landlady is really dishonest or not; and what the difference is between a 24-liang scale and a balance scale, so I had to let them weigh it for me as they pleased. However, I could clearly see the amount of vegetables, and they weighed at least half of what they should have given me. If the landlord's scale is indeed 24 liang, and the vendor's scale is also 12 liang, then the daily disputes and arguments in the vegetable market are probably due to this reason.</p>
<p>Fortunately, from the next day onwards, the landlady took over this task, otherwise, I think I would have had to move back home again. The difficult problem has been solved, but I have doubts about our country's system of weights and measures. For example, with scales, since it is stipulated that 16 liang is equivalent to a catty on a balance scale, why is it arbitrarily increased or decreased to 12 liang or 24 liang? Of course, the seller is not willing to lose eight liang per catty, and how can the buyer accept 12 liang as a catty? And yet, neither side is willing to honestly use a balance scale. Another example is when cutting clothing material, stores use the market foot (市尺), while tailors use the full foot (足尺), so the calculated material often cannot be sewn. Then why not uniformly use the market foot or the full foot? It's really puzzling. Other things, such as the varying sizes of dou (斗) and hu (斛) (units of dry measure), can only be attributed to whether the store is dishonest or not.</p>
<p>A month ago, I read a Changshu dispatch regarding the inspection of wine pots and measuring vessels. I am now copying it below:</p>
<p>"The county government has notified the wine merchants in this county that the wine pots they use, which are traditionally divided into four types: half a jin (catty), one jin, one and a half jin, and two jin, must be inspected because they are measuring vessels, and replaced with newly made ones. Otherwise, they will all be confiscated after the Dragon Boat Festival. The merchants, feeling that the loss would be too great, specially submitted a petition to the county government, arguing that wine pots are a type of container, and the weight is determined by weighing separately. To avoid misunderstandings for the sake of convenience, they requested that the names of the wine pots be changed to Tai (泰), Da (大), Zhong (中), and Xiao (小) (Extra Large, Large, Medium, and Small), and that this be put on record. If containers must be inspected, then the pots used for cooking rice and the sacks used for storing rice should also be inspected..."</p>
<p>Insufficient wine capacity has nothing to do with the wine pot. The so-called wine pot is a kind of container, and the weight is separately measured. However, whether the scales are standard and whether the weigher can weigh accurately is another question. Moreover, according to the rules of wine shops, a wine pot with a broken spout is considered more valuable. Even if "newly made ones are exchanged," it won't help.</p>
<p>These shortcomings of the system of weights and measures, which can also be said to be malpractices, should be "inspected." Each industry should handle this automatically. I will not design solutions for them in this article.</p>
<p>However, after establishing standard weights and measures, there are still malpractices of excess and deficiency, which is the so-called "dishonest heart" problem. The Chinese are a people who like to "take advantage," which has long been established.</p>
