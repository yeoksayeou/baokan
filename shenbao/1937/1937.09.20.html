<h3>全綫沉寂僅有小接觸</h3>
<p>敵軍三次總攻死亡逾萬　永安橋我二度反攻獲勝　我維持原陣線仍佔優勢</p>
<p>近一週來敵傾全力、下全綫總攻擊令、經我前綫各路忠勇將士迎頭痛擊、敵死亡逾萬、士氣大挫、創傷之巨、確為滬戰以來所未有、目下敵似在積極整理殘部、調集援軍、圖作最後之掙扎、我軍亦抱定沉着堅守、以逸待勞原則、故昨日一晝夜間、全綫比較沉寂、僅有小接觸、敵以小部隊雖不斷騷擾我陣地、均經我先後擊退、蓋為窺探虛實性質、無關戰局、昨日下午三時、及六時、我軍二度向敵永安橋陣地反攻、我砲隊並發砲助戰、敵倉皇應戰、不支後退、截獲輜重頗多、未幾我仍退守原防、羅店劉行方面、我陣綫兀然不動、江灣閘北一帶間有機關槍及步槍聲、今晨一時後較密、我堅守原陣地、且仍保持優勢、預料此數日中、敵當再傾海陸空軍全力、犯我羅店劉行之綫、我養精蓄銳、誓與頑敵再决雌雄、</p>
<p>最近一星期來、前綫兩方無重大變化、敵現傾全力犯羅店及劉行、自羅店失陷後、該方我軍現在五斗涇·南北塘·北朱店等處、與敵相持、敵連日損失極重、劉行以東、我軍扼守朝王廟及金家灣、顧家宅北、我軍在楊木橋東陸宅、敵已佔永安僑、昨日下午我軍復向楊行之敵反攻、敵雖頑强抵抗、我已進至永安橋、此處為本月十三日我軍變化陣綫以來、敵攻擊最烈之處、江灣區北、我軍守嚴家灣（沿蘊藻浜）陸家橋宅、嶺南學校、葉家花園之綫、兩方深溝高壘、連日無大戰、僅為雙方哨兵每日互相開槍攻擊而已、而該方敵、皆為我被迫而來之東北同胞、為張海鵬李守信二逆之部隊、信一旦遇有機會、當可反正來歸、據口口口部參謀口君談、過去一月中、我軍未將敵完全消滅者、由於敵賴艦砲及飛機之轟炸、我損傷稍重、自移至新陣綫後、卽在各地裝置高射機槍及機關砲、一見敵機、卽予射擊、故最近數日中、敵飛至我陣地上空者殊少、偶或飛來、亦均徘佪高空、其不若以前之猖狂、是足見其膽怯而不敢嘗試也云云、</p>
<h3>滬戰爆發後敵第三次大慘敗</h3>
<p>敵於九一八前夕孤注一擲　屢遭重創士氣沮喪正待援</p>
<p>中央社云、連日戰事重心在羅店一綫、敵自在虹口楊樹浦受挫後乃襲“一二八”故智、置其主力於瀏河登陸、全圖威脅我之側背、不料於羅店之役、被我殲滅殆𧗊乃不得不向國內乞援、迨本月一日以來、復挾其海陸空軍之精銳、及機械化部隊、由吳淞强行登陸、進犯我北泗塘及楊行附近之陣地、經我軍英勇抗戰、斃敵甚多、我軍為一網打盡計、乃遂漸引敵深入、敵以為勝利可操、不惜冒然輕進·連日於永安橋楊木橋附近、激戰甚烈、至十七日、敵不惜盡其所有之精銳、作孤注一擲、期於“九一八”之前夕、與我决戰、孰知我軍早已窺破其陰謀、我前方將士、忠勇為國、不惜犧牲、以一當百、予敵以迎頭之痛擊、經數度衝鋒、遂將敵完全殲滅於我陣地之前、是為滬戰爆發以來敵第三次之大敗績、敵屢遭重創、士氣沮喪、不敢輕進、正待增援補充中、</p>
<h3>楊行月浦羅店方面連日激戰經過</h3>
<p>某高級軍官之談話</p>
<p>中央社記者、於九一八赴淞滬戰綫視察、晤及某高級軍官、承告以近日楊行月浦及羅店方面之激戰、狀况甚詳、茲特誌之如下、</p>
<p>本月十二日、敵陸軍第三第六第十一第十二第十六及新增之第九各師團、利用優勢之海空軍、開始向我作第三期總攻、其主力由楊行月浦、沿竇劉竇羅公路兩側地區、向我陣地中央攻擊、企圖於九一八以前、截斷滬太公路、確古淞滬、並以一部由羅店及小川沙方面、向我包圍羅店之部隊突擊、</p>
<p>十三十四兩日、迭在顧家閣、徐家閣、永安橋等處、與我軍作劇烈之爭奪戰、我軍將士俱抱與陣地同存亡之决心、待其步兵接近時、卽行迎擊斃敵甚多、屍橫遍野、其攻擊毫無進步、是敵第一次之頓挫、十四日黃昏後、我乘敵疲憊、全綫逆襲、在羅店地區、戰鬥尤為劇烈、長橋六維橋潘家橋站等處敵軍、當時俱被我軍攻破界涇河水、帶成赤色、羅店全被焚毀、奪獲敵第二十二聯隊軍旗一面、搜獲敵軍重要命令文件甚多、據某軍官日記內記載、激戰十日、每連傷亡超過半數、</p>
<p>十六日、敵收拾殘餘、以台灣守備隊、向羅店增援、再行攻擊、因天氣陰霧、大雨淋漓、敵空軍頓失活動、我軍士氣奮發、常以主力由正面逆襲、在南北塘口東姜西姜及羅店一帶、與敵激戰、因我步砲協同得力、迫擊砲發揮偉大效果、攻擊我張家堰之敵約一團、立見崩潰、同時我嘉定之高射砲、及金家灣我陣地前面、各擊落敵轟炸機一架、本日敵死亡奇重、是敵攻擊第二次之頓挫、</p>
<p>十七日、敵以其新到之一師、加入楊行正面、復作最後之總攻、不惜以密集部隊、向我重疊猛攻、我以機槍掃射、斃敵無算、我陣地屹然未動、適我生力軍趕到、卽由楊木橋金家宅及北朱橋一帶加入反攻、向敵猛力掃蕩、至十二時、將敵全部擊潰、十八晨以來、敵全部向後退却、楊行永安橋金家灣一帶地區、方圓十餘里、敵人屍體遍地皆是、並遺棄軍用品甚多、其狼狽可以想見、計與敵激戰六日、斃敵鉅萬、此為敵軍第三期總攻慘敗之經過情形、氣燄萬丈之敵軍、已無再攻之能力矣、</p>
<h3>我空軍襲擊敵大損</h3>
<p>西報記載其受損事實　上海紡織公司亦被炸</p>
<p>字林報云、十八日晚六時五十分起至九時止、又自十一時起至午夜後止、上海遭遇歷史上空前之空襲、蓋中國飛機、在楊樹浦匯山百老匯區紛擲炸彈與燒夷彈、致引起大火數處也、諸機自月光皎潔之天空中突下、在低度拋擲炸彈、其勇敢爲前所未覩、當時起火之地、共有九處之多、日人所辦上海紡織公司炸彈一枚、適中其廠、起火甚熾、據太陸報云、上海紡織紗廠為日人在華所辦紗廠最大者之一、日人現因為軍事集中點、至該廠內部損失情形、則未能探悉、怡和紗廠紡紗間、亦因中彈起火、但卽為守廠印人撲滅、又據上海泰晤士報云、十八日晚、中國飛機之襲擊楊樹浦等處、有炸彈一枚、擊中日砲艦一艘、楊樹浦日軍陣地亦大受損失、</p>
<p>中央社云、我空軍前晚來滬襲擊敵艦、並轟炸敵軍陣地、除擊中敵艦一艘、（另有一艘係砲彈擊中）、及炸毀敵軍軍用品甚夥外、並悉東熙華德路兆豐路之空地上、停有敵　軍車坦克車及裝甲車多輛、亦被我軍炸毀云、</p>
<h3>劉行敵軍慘敗紀實</h3>
<p>楊木橋殘敵完全擊潰　滬太公路旁敵屍山積</p>
<p>昨接得劉行方面戰報如下、㊀十七日有敵軍三聯隊、向我劉家行東面楊木僑至朝王廟之綫、猛烈砲轟自下午至黃昏之間、復有步兵一部向我陣地進攻、我軍立卽奪起、予以逆襲衝鋒、肉搏數次、激戰至當晚十時許、卒將敵軍完全擊潰、沿滬太公路兩旁敵軍、屍如山積、其在小朱宅方面之敵、被我集中砲火、猛力轟擊、捐失奇重、自十七晚至十八晨、前綫已歸靜寂、足知敵軍攻勢行動、已完全失敗矣、㊁十七晚劉家行之敵被我擊斃中佐一名搜査其身藏之符號、係廣島第五師團之三十四聯隊、又査閱其日記簿上所載、知該部於本月一日到揚子江口、五日登陸、六日在吳淞休息、九日始向楊行劉行方面前進、㊂楊木橋沿公路兩旁、及金家灣附近、敵軍死傷最多、約有一千餘人、並遺棄武器材料甚多、</p>
<h3>敵機窺探浦東等處</h3>
<p>昨晨（十九日）六時左右、敵機十餘架由東北飛來、在浦東上空盤旋、窺探良久、並用機槍無的掃射、旋乂分散至閘北滬西滬南龍華等處窺察、至九時許始去、</p>
<p>浦東</p>
<p>敵機三十餘架、於昨日上午七時至十時、飛往浦東一帶、濫肆轟炸、然被害者乃係平民、浦東洋涇鎭與其昌棧一帶房屋、幾半數被毀、民衆因是處淪為戰區、早已多數逃亡、故死傷尚少、惟敵機分一小隊、又在南碼頭董家渡楊家渡一帶、或用機槍掃射、或投以炸彈、浦東新馬路一帶民房、被毀若不少、而各該處後方鄕民較多、且係中秋節、較平日來往行人為多、計傷者有十餘人之多、幸無死者、</p>
<p>閔行</p>
<p>上海縣屬閔行鎭、為全縣第一市鎮、沿黃浦建有碼頭、為全縣之最繁盛地段、其精華處之老街前街一帶、凡被四次投彈、都為瓦礫、乃昨晨敵機復住閔行鎮市梢及祝港一帶投彈、是以閔行所餘完好可以居住者、僅稍遠之鄕間、</p>
<p>南翔</p>
<p>南翔方面、敵機至昨日已六次轟炸香花橋及南街、最繁盛之區域、已成焦土、惟香花橋有奉通緝之漢奸方某房屋、毫無損失、且無綫電之電綫、並未毀壞、</p>
<h3>閘北一帶前線沉寂</h3>
<p>中央社云、軍息、昨日閘北及江灣路一帶、前綫殊為沉寂除偶有小接觸外、整日並無劇戰云、</p>
<p>江灣方面之敵、以援軍開到補充配備、十七日以來、敵蟄伏壕內、未敢濟出、故全綫沉寂、至前晨五時、敵突向我北站五卅公墓及持志大學各點、以猛烈之砲火、不斷射擊、至六時半始止、我工事堅固、絕無損失、而三民路以北李家橋泗涇球塲一帶、有敵三百餘人、向我進犯、經我迎頭截殺、當將其擊退、</p>
<h3>寶山城內傀儡組織</h3>
<p>昨日淞滬各綫沉寂、未有劇烈之戰門、敵軍淸晨進攻劉行、曾有繁密之槍砲聲、但半小時卽停息、閘北八字橋水電路一帶、敵以迫擊砲掩護、分批向我陣地進襲、經我軍用機槍掃射後、遂倉卒退回原路、茲探悉敵方為利用漢奸便利騙使起見、已在寶山城內組織地方維持會、會址設於城隍廟、聞由漢奸何梅生及王正才等三十餘人組織、居然傀儡登塲、並出示安民、語多荒謬無恥、幸該地民衆、早已逃避一空、所餘僅少數老弱殘廢之輩云、</p>
<h3>敵艦續運軍火到滬</h3>
<p>今晨（十九日）黎明前續有敵運輸艦上海丸衣笠丸二艘駛滬、停靠匯山碼頭、起卸軍火、頗形忙碌、至前駛滬之良友丸、地田丸、第五雲海丸、另一艘無名號之運輸艦、依然外泊於招商局北棧及黃浦碼頭、迄未駛出、現大阪黃浦招商局北棧中棧匯山各碼頭棧房、皆已堆滿敵軍火及軍需品云、</p>
<h3>浦江昨敵艦廿五艘</h3>
<p>中央社云、泊浦敵艦、自經我空軍於前晚數度夜襲後、多相率逃往楊樹浦以下一帶浦面、直至昨日下午、始有一部陸續駛回浦內、茲據記者昨日下午赴浦面調査所得、悉各敵艦停泊情形如下、日本郵船碼頭十一號驅逐艦一艘、招商局北棧良友丸一艘、無名號運輸艦一艘、匯山碼頭上海丸衣笠丸各一艘、黃浦碼頭地田丸第五雲海丸各一艘、三十八二十一十七十五十三及一號浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、三十一二十七二十四二十二十八十六十四及十三號浮筒砲艦各一艘、另十一號浮筒砲艦二艘、新三井碼頭砲艦一艘、二號浮洞出雲旗艦一艘、以上共計砲艦十一艘、驅逐艦七艘、運輸艦六艘、出雲旗艦一艘、共二十五艘、</p>
<h3>東京大政變之內幕</h3>
<p>宇垣并辭大將頭銜後　少壯派認為反抗天皇</p>
<p>東京通信、所謂東京大政變、此間當局、雖未明白發表、而其內容、已有洩出、惟不能詳細耳、被暗殺之某大將、卽宇垣大將也、宇垣在去年組閣、軍部以其與財閥有關係、且黨派不同、故竭力阻梗、宇垣在失敗後、憤恨之餘、曾將大將頭銜一併辭去、意謂、余旣無組閣資格、當然亦不能為大將、蓋大將在戰時、須統率三軍也、宇垣明知日本陸軍中、大將人材缺乏、以資格論、將來一朝有事、彼軍部必用我爲主將、故特辭大將、以示抵抗、及此次滬戰上、陸戰隊失敗、擬派陸軍、一時苦無相主將、軍部暗中探宇垣意、欲其出馬、宇垣不可、且頗堅决不得已、軍部乃以松井敷衍戰事、一面少壯派軍人、對宇垣大為憤慨、謂大將頭銜、係天皇所授、與學者之學位不同、豈可辭去、辭去大將、卽反抗天皇、彼等謀害宇垣、之原因卽在於此、</p>
<h3>前駐美大使施肇基之談話</h3>
<p>應以國際行動抑制敵軍暴行　各國對日放任程度令人疑慮　我對美國關係密切期待較深</p>
<p>中央社云、前駐美大使施肇基博士、自卸去大使職務後、卽寓居滬上、昨日（十九日）對記者發表談話、略謂、“我國民衆對暴日侵略、敵愾同仇、精神團結、余頗為欣慰、此次歐美各國、在滬報紙之社論、對日本侵略行為、及作戰方法、莫不一致痛加譴責、友邦輿論、對我深表同情、余亦大為感動、至日本違反迄今世界各國所認為‘文明’之一切國際公法、如殘殺非戰門員醫院病人及紅十字會會員等、事實俱在、毋庸多言、日人此種殘暴行為苟不以國際行動加以抑制、在將來或且最近將來、必致發生反響、誠然、此文化世界决不能漠視國聯盟約九國公約凱洛格非戰公約下所負之義務、彼等必須起而阻止日本侵略行動、緣一九三一年日本侵略滿洲之結果、已使全世界陷人混亂也、”施氏談及淞滬戰局、謂“我國軍隊英勇抗戰、士氣極盛、蓋彼等瞭解彼等乃為正義與文化及保衛國家、俾免受侵略與蹂躪而奮鬥、我國軍民、無論在國內或國外、無不决意繼續抵抗到底、實則一切空前未有之浩刦與流血、常可循適當國際行動而得减輕或避免、余每念及此、卽憶及數十年前在天津所發生之某事伴、卽美國海軍司令營敎英海軍司令於其危急之時是也、此事發生於一八五九年、當時英國艦隊司令霍勃海軍上將、曾受重傷、其所部亦死傷甚衆、美艦波瓦倫號司令戴納爾、當卽親訪該司令加以慰問於途中、時適有英水兵若干名、分乘數小船、於企圖營救沙灘上之英水兵時、為潮退所阻、美司令覩此卽毫不猶豫、令其淺水船數艘、馳往援助、並謂“血誠較水為重也”、彼時美司令戴納爾之行動、雖在技術上違反“中立”地位、且外交界人士亦均認爲茲事複雜、惟美司令此種義擧、卽已迅速獲得世界各方之同情、美司令認人道主義較重於外交上之考慮、此種英明之判斷、各國人士、均認爲合理、美司令戴納爾之言行、不僅使當時芙美人士、深為感動、且至今仍爲人所稱頌、職是之故、世界各國對日本之侵略行為、究將視若無覩至何程度、誠令人表示疑惑也、對於中美目前關係、施氏因係前駐美大使、現卸職歸來、故踟願不欲多言、惟謂中國人民與美國接觸較早、故對美國期待較他國為深、此種感覺、具有歷史基礎、蓋在美國宣吿獨立前、兩國卽發生密切之貿易關係、早年中美通商時、對於當時幼年美國之經濟情形、大有裨益、嗣機於上世紀之上半葉時、美國航業發展、中美貿易、復使美國在太平洋沿岸之發展、蒙受其惠、美國敎士、幾與美國商船同時抵達廣州、美國人士在敎育工作醫院及慈善事業、亦均常處於領導地位、世界大戰後、當華盛頓會議擧行時、美國曾堅决主張在東方採行新措施、於是乃有九國公約之簽訂、九國公約簽字國、幾將與目前中日糾紛有關之太平洋各國包羅在內、施氏於結論謂、該項公約、並含有應付目前糾紛之條款云、</p>

<h3>抗日罪言</h3>
<p>— 林庚白</p>
<p>頃者邦人君子，每以為中日之爭，實由日之軍閥，刦持其政府，及其元老重臣，以迄其政黨，而出於鹵莽滅裂，非元老重臣之本意，抑亦非政黨與人民所樂聞，此大誤也。日本目其傳統之封建集團意識之存在，與夫經濟之發展不能不更求廣大之殖民地為其尾閭而言，兩者皆不得不吞併中國，此豈僅如歐美資本主義各國於歐戰之損失，殖民地之不易於統治，可同日而語，襄大隈重信嘗戲伊藤一君為朝鮮總監，我將為支那總監，一此稍習日本者能道之。矧其民族共有之狹隘愛國主義，由於好大喜功之民族性，助長發揚，又與其政治經濟之立場，相激相邊，終於一橫决，故日本帝國主義之組織，一日不變更，則日本之必不肯放棄其天併中國之企圖，請也亦勢也。於此而猶冀中日妥協，何異於談孝經以却“黃巾”，是直天下之至騃者矣。愚深信日本社會之革命未實現以前，日本帝國主義之機構，依然强固，茍非其政治，突起重大而急劇之變化，如一九一九德國之革命者，君主政體，隨戰爭而颠覆，中日蓋無合作之餘地。何則，國際之環境，日本自身之政治與經濟，固皆早已决定日本帝國主義者之動向，雖軍關跋扈稍殺，無改於日本對華之心理也。吾人旣主張澈底抗戰，願全國人士，同此認識，從而引伸之，倡導之，庶幾中華民族最後之一滴血，不輕於犧牲，愚將馨香以求之。</p>
<p>自平津形成日本帝國主義者事實上的軍事根據地，抗戰空氣，隨敵熖而高，在中央政府和最高領袖的領導之下，我們早就相信中日的和平，走進最後的階段了，上海的戰爭爆發後，這最後的階段，更到了盡頭。本來這幾年的中日期，所謂和平，僅是一方面的幻想，和他方面利用時機的湊合，因此在文字賞中，雖可以看見中國領土和主權的完整，同時這美麗的文字，也已經被日本帝國主義者的砲火紛碎了。中國方面，本其最大的容忍，始則以言和為主，而以備戰為副，繼則以備戰為主，而以言和為副，從未嘗停止和議進行，其用意不但在維持中日的和平，而在奠定東亞的和平，以至世界的和平。不幸始則啟日本的輕蔑而加强侵略，繼則招日本的猜忌和乘虛，於是有先發制人之舉，牠們預定在年內對華全面作戰的提早，好像已呈現於眼面前，但我的觀察，日本帝闢主義者外强中乾的裂痕，恰於上海的戰爭，暴露了出來，也正為了這個，我們應當以最終的決心和努力，澈度抗戰，並宣布斷絕國交，那末最有利的前途，一定在中國而不在日本。誰都知道，日本帝國主義者的襲取平津，為的要佔領察綏，浸假而威脅冀晋，進而侵略蒙古，更進而進攻蘇聯，可是我們還要知道，而使日本帝國主義者對於察綏乃至於冀晋的企圖，全都實現了，但整個的中國，牠們仍不能夠抓住時，這就會影響於牠們的侵路蒙古和進攻蘇聯，所以牠們在一天沒有支配著整個的中國以前，日本帝國主義者是不敢輕於發動對蒙對蘇的軍事，因為中國隨時可以給予牠們以重大的打擊，在這一觀點上，我們狠明顯的看出，日本帝國主義者必須把中國的政權，置於牠們的支配下，換一句話，牠們至少要有操縱中國政府的把握，而且要完全操縱，才能以全力來侵略蒙古和進攻蘇聯，牠們天天所喊的中日共同防共的協定，那不過是日本帝國主義者暫時穩定中日關係一種的手段，到了牠們勝利的一天，中國的命運也就不待說了。</p>
<p>這樣更知道，日本的不宣而戰，而且以外交為緩衝，不僅是欺騙，不僅是日本政府施放的烟幕彈，簡直可以說，這是日本帝國主義者始終掩蓋不住的牠們自己的弱點，只要看最近。全面戰事，已經開始，日本外務省，並斷絕國交而不承認，大家不要忽略了，這不絕如縷的國交，是日本帝國主義者的弱點，是對於中國下的酖毒，是中華民族解放的暗礁，我們萬萬不可以在部局的戰事獲得勝利，甚至失敗了的時期中，采取外交的方式，讓牠們多了凖備的機會，另一方面，我們的戰事，無論勝敗，或者相持，都要認定外交的談判，最足以懈士氣而長寇氛，東北四省和平津的敎訓，已經在告訴我們。</p>
<p>在這裹我所慮者，不是中國軍事整個的敗北，而是局部的勝敗，或者相持，因為敗北的結果，如果言和，到那時，城下之盟，等於亡國，這在中國方面，該會出於最後的掙扎，但中國要遭帥到局部的勝利，或者相持時，第三國免不了要再出來為進一步的調停，尤其在局部的勝利時，一例如上海登陸日軍的肅清一道進一步的調停，多少帶有緩和日本和點綴中國的體面的意味，至於日本是否能接受，另一問題，那麼一來，歧路的徬徨，又橫在中國的面前了。</p>
<p>也是誰都知道，日本帝國主義者的對華不能持久戰，但除了大家公認的政治上內在的危機，和經濟上的不容許以外，顧慮蘇聯，實是最大的原因，我們可以肯定，日本的重視中蘇，蓋互為其因果，在中國不曾完全被支配時，日本固然不敢進攻蘇聯，可是放鬆了蘇聯，而先以整個的武力來侵略中國，使蘇聯坐大，萬一戰爭延長，蘇聯的國力，也一天天的充實起米，這後顧之憂在日本等於黃雀，日本帝國主義者，決不會這樣不智的，因此日本的對華，只能步步為營，假使中國眞的能澈底抗戰，日本帝國主義者勢力的崩潰，可立而待。</p>
<p>因此在蘇聯肅軍和中國備戰中，日本急遽的大舉侵略中國，看似逞强而實是示弱，由於這個，日本帝國主義者的對華不能持久戰，愈益圖窮匕見了。我相信澈底抗戰到了相當期間，蘇聯自然而然地會參加聯合的戰綫，因為中國戰勝，蘇聯的出兵，固然可以坐收漁人之利，如果戰敗，為了唇亡齒寒的關係，蘇聯史不能不奮起為中國後盾，也就是為自衛，否則日德夾攻中的蘇聯，豈有倖免的可能。同時我更相信，中國如能利用戰事的相持，亟與蘇聯締結遠東的軍事協定，於彼此尤其有裨。</p>
<p>有人以為蘇聯一旦捲入中日戰爭的漩渦，勢必使英美猜疑，德意嫉視，我覺着這僅看到一半，因為英美對華，只要保持市場的地位，並無其他企圖，德意在遠東更沒有直接的利害關係。英美的不能助華反日，也就同樣決定了。牠們的不能助日排華，至於德意對中國，旣無所謂利害，自然只有站在旁觀的立場，這都是顯而易見的。要是說，英德不顧意削弱日本的力量，更為了英日同盟的醞釀，日德協定的成立，英德的挺身而出，總有一天，那我們更要知道歐洲國際間的矛盾，和歐美國際間的矛盾，錯綜複雜，千變萬化，假使不是和自身的直接利害生衝突，而且萬不可避免訴諸武力時，任何一國，都躭憂着牽一髮而動全身，在相互的掣肘中，誰也不肯輕易越出自己的軍事圍牆外，向別個和自己國力相等的國家挑戰起來，這也是鐵一般的事實。何况美國的遠東門戶開放政策，和英國傳統的外交政策，都是以避免武力為原則，德意雖是在大大伺隙而動，尤其德國對於蘇聯某一部分領士的顗覦，但畢竟也為了這些矛盾的阻礙，决不會像日本這樣的鹵莽滅裂，所以英德即使要袒日，至少也要到了日本帝國主義者的勢力縮減至某，限度時，如果在這期間中，中國還不曾和蘇聯實際上有軍事同盟白結合，那末牠們的袒日，止於中立，就是和蘇聯結合了時，爲袒日而出於武力，也只有德國，但還要看那時，中蘇兩國外交的運用怎樣。</p>

<p>有功將士之酬庸。死傷將士之優卹。中央自有其辦法。但以為酬庸之典。於升遷獎賞榮施優禮之外。在今雖無軍功世襲之例。然於其後裔亦宜有優異之待遇。並宜仿凌烟紫光之故事。俾誌景仰於無窮。死亡將士。於從優矜恤撫養遺孤之外。並宜酌免其捐稅。敎育其子女。尤當於死難殉忠之所。建立昭忠祠。俎豆千秋。以激發後人忠勇之熱忱。至於受傷將士。最關緊要者莫過於有適宜之治療。從各方報告中。知前方將士受傷後所遭遇之困難有不堪言狀者。薔敵人不顧人道。不守公法。任意轟炸救護之車輛。遂使前方受傷將士。非夜間不得出運。而夜運多艱、父不能迅速將享。𥨱謂前綫亟應配置相當之敎護設備。而后方之傷兵醫院。旣為傷兵而服務。尤宜處處對之寄以深厚之同情。蓋彼等之創傷。非為私門。而為公戰。非為自已。而為吾人。無論呻昤呼號與夫暴躁忿激之狀。要知皆為病者之常態。卽至不可救治。亦必使其在一瞑之前。仿忘其苦痛之所自。此則不得不屬望於具有割股心腸之醫生護士。勉抑情感。蕃為調治。頻加安慰。使傷者不覺其為苦也。</p>

<p>今也貴國竟入迷途、不以友誼之態度、與合作之精神、與中國共謀兩國之福利、貴國誠能對華實行親善、則日本之所欲取於中國者、將何求而不得、若中日彼此親善、互相供給、根據合作之原則、以求兩國之繁榮、則日本之大學、必滿有中國之學生、日本之工廠、必取得中國與亞洲之原料、以為製造、今貴國不此之圖　而甘趨於黑暗之途徑、窮兵黷武、以求一逞　此去戰事延長、無論明戰暗戰、恐須長年累月也</p>
<p>德恐貴國誤入歧途、釀成災禍、且目下東方對日之態度、已有變更、昔也亞洲民族、大都欽羨日本之進化、而心仰之為領袖、以為亞洲權益、可得貴國之保障、而不受西方之侵害、詎創貴國反自蠶食亞洲大陸、以遂鯨吞之野心、致使亞洲民族咸懷惶懼之心、而日本因之亦失其盟主之地位、此種地位、日本早已佔得、但以宰割中國之故而復失之、日本若非軍事當局之妄用武力、則中國早已傾心相向、而表同情、即其餘亞洲各國、當與中國同其態度、須知日本生機、繫於商業、然仇日者終無與日通商之可能、故日本此舉、實不啻自斬其生機也、</p>

<p>若謂德之所言、不外片面之辭說、然德不欲有所演說、惟覺中心悲痛、而不能不呼號也、且德所言、較德對於中國領袖、舉凡腐敗錯誤之處、直陳切勸、自視措詞尚無過激、且德方與敝國民衆講演、凡屬敝國民族之罪惡、尤為指斥不赦、此則人之共知者也、</p>
<p>當知吾人皆深有缺憾、即筆者與其他無不如是也、惟茲所欲言者、則今日世界中所犯之國際罪惡、實為日本對於中國之侵略、此種舉動、實為對華之罪行破壞國際之和平、毀損自身之利益、而又消滅日本對於世界固有之貢獻、尚望貴國猛自反省、復為當日未入迷途而為吾人所希望之日本、俾吾人得以追隨其後、而沾其惠、惟貴國對華之失策、一日不變、則無論文化道德精神各方面、皆難蒙受其益、即經濟方面、吾恐亦將如是也、誠以德與貴國人士、素有友誼、故敢掬誠忠吿、臨穎痛心尚希察鑒、龔斯德上言（完）</p>

<h3>市救濟委員會辦理救濟難民情形</h3>
<p>自蘆溝橋事件爆發、本市各慈善團體、卽紛起組織救濟機關、旋以滬上局勢、亦日趨緊張、市社會局局長潘公展、為集中救濟力量、統一辦事機構起見、卽聯合有關係各機關團體、組成上海市救濟委員會、由潘局長任主席委員、並羅致慈善界領袖十一人、担任常務委員、先假仁濟堂辦公、繼復遷至浦東大厦、一月來工作極為緊張、茲將該會成立後情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>創辦團體</p>
<p>該會係上海市社會局、上海市地方協會、上海慈善團體聯合救災會、中國紅十字會、世界紅卐字會、上海華洋義振會、中國華洋義振救災總會、中華公敎進行會、上海基督敎靑年會、及本市醫藥團體、暨各旅滬同鄕團體等所共同組織、純以慈善普濟為宗旨、辦理非常時期一切救濟事宜、</p>
<p>內部組織</p>
<p>該會之內部、分設秘書處及總務外交財務收容給餐遣送醫藥訓導警衛掩埋等組、秘書處設祕書主任一人、秘書二人、幹事若干人、各組設主任委員一人、副主任委員二人、委員若干人、另設監察委員若干人、負監察該會會務進行之責、</p>
<p>收容救濟</p>
<p>該會成立未久、滬戰卽行爆發、於是戰區居民、紛紛逃入租界避難、該會卽派員接洽收容難民塲所、及調度救護車輛等事宜、旋以戰區擴大、難民源源而來、原有塲所、勢難容納、乃由潘局長先行令知各學校、儘先為收容之用、後復與各遊藝塲所接洽、借給收容難民、蓋是時各學校在暑期內、均未開學、各遊藝塲所、亦以時局關係、均陷於停頓狀態中、故利用此種塲所、可收容多量難民、</p>
<p>收容情形</p>
<p>滬　爆發於八月十三日、但於十二日已有無數民衆、遭遇敵軍之蹂𨈆、紛紛逃難出外、故於是日、該會卽成立收容所五所、收容難民五百餘人、其後戰事爆發、戰區遂見擴大、難民亦日益增多、該會除竭力設法、增設收容所外、並促請其他團體機關或個人協助、添設收容所、據該會最近之調査、由該會設立兼自發糧食者、計有五十九所、其他機關辦理、由該會發給糧食者、計十二所、其他機關辦理兼糧食者、三十九所、尚有開辦後因辦理不善而中止者、及尚在籌備中者、亦有三十餘所、故最多時遠一百四十餘所、所收難民約四萬餘人、收容塲所、均分佈於各寺廟各游藝塲各學校各空房屋及其他公共塲所、設法輸送、自開辦收容後、難民愈來愈衆、頗有容積不下之勢，且租界內時遭流彈之波及、故不得不設法遣送、該會卽與航政局公用局及兩路管理局洽商、指定專車專輪、由水陸兩路分別遣送、但因鐵路綫時為敵機所轟炸、致路綫發生障礙、火車無法行駛、故僅賴汽車及輪船輸送、輸送之難民、大半至杭州蘇州嘉興湖州等處、每日所輸送之難民、多則數千人、少則數百人不等、</p>
<h3>國際救濟會擬辦華界收容所</h3>
<p>自八一三淞滬抗日戰爭發生後、戰區難民紛紛逃避租界、投入各處收容所、但在戰區未逃出者、為數尚多、時有擬入租界而被阻止者、東奔西突、為狀殊慘、現值秋季、入夜寒冷異常、國際救濟會為此、擬在華界假學校收容、由該會常委奧爾負責向日方接洽、由屈文六向各校接洽、</p>
<h3>“我已經許身於國家和民族”</h3>
<p>— 呂文亭</p>
<p>前天報上登載着敵機長斧田卯之助的妻子敏子的一封信，內有“黑崎军曹逃避戰死的那樣事，希望你具有那樣的神氣。”而在友聲旅行團創辦的傷兵醫院裹却有一位許身於國而要未婚妻另行出嫁的我們的勇士蔣鈞德，在互相對照之下，這是更給於“最後之胜利屬於我們的”一個强有力的保證。</p>
<p>呂文亭女士是友德小學的創辦人，現在這學校或許已經燬滅於砲火之下了，她就自願加入醫院為看護，這篇文字就是由她執筆的　　編者識</p>
<p>走着泥濘的路，準時抵達了傷兵醫院。看護傷兵，這對我是件愉快的工作，每天，我好像去受了“民族救亡抗敵”的一課，在和他們——他們是一羣民族的英雄—的接近中，充分地知道最前綫的勇士們的生活，思想，英雄的抗戰的事實，以及壯烈犧牲的故事。</p>
<p>“在後方如同生活在前方”，德國大戲劇家歐文坡斯卡托的話驚地又浮上腦膜。在這裹，我是暸解了敵人的槍砲如何地激動着他們的情緒，轉變着他們的意識。士氣之盛，那不是一般人可以想像得到的；這，使我更堅信了；“最後勝利是必然屬於義們的</p>
<p>“呂小姐！”一個四川人的口音。</p>
<p>“什么？要茶喝嗎？”掉轉身去，我知道××師×××團的一個兵士在喊我，他的姓名是蔣鈞德。</p>
<p>勞駕您啦，我想請你代我寫封信，寄給我家裏老父。”</p>
<p>我非常高興的答應了他。於是，他就述他那封要寄去的家信的內容；</p>
<p>“首先吿訴我爸爸，我在上海殺敵略帶受了一些傷，現在住在醫院裹，一切都很舒服，呌他老人家不要牽記。再說我等待傷愈後，仍要赴前綫去殺敵，替我們的民族，國家復仇，呌他老人家不要替我擔心傷愁。”</p>
<p>說到這裏，他暫時的沉默了。許是傷口在疼痛，用手撫着右腿膝骨包紮着的傷處，但他絕不示弱地呻吟，使我感到他的偉大的精神。</p>
<p>半響，他接着說；</p>
<p>“呂小姐，請你在信上再吿訴他老人家，說這次的抗敵，是為民族爭自由而戰，是為國家求生存而戰。我們不願做奴隸，所以我們要跟敵人拼命。‘忠心衛國’，這是男兒的天職！再吿訴他老人家吧，忠孝是不能兩全的，請他好好地保重身子，保護弟妹，說等我殺盡了國土內的敵人，那時我可回去再孝順他的。”</p>
<p>他的話使找萬分的感動，我興奮，我高興，我更敬佩他對於這次抗戰底正確的認識。</p>
<p>“沒有旁的話嗎？”</p>
<p>“不，還有，吿訴他老人家，假如我的未婚妻的家屬來說話，呌她去另行嫁人吧，說我已經許身於國家和民族了，恐怕誤她的終身幸福。”頓了一頓，他又說；“家裹恐怕又短了零用，我領到的餉銀預備從郵局匯去，請你在信上也附提一筆吧，再說以後有錢當再寄去。”</p>
<p>這時候，在我的腦膜上頓的浮起了兩幅圖畫。一幅是志士們勇敢地犧牲了自己的幸福，擎着槍，吹着號角，為祖國的獨立自由而抗敵！另一幅却是那些所謂高等華人在百樂門舞廳裹享樂逍遙。</p>
<p>“土耳其人已經到了拜占庭城下，而那兒的紳士們却還在睡着”。醉死夢生的人們呀！要是你們能够在志士們的跟前站立一分鐘，我想你們眞會汗顏而愧死的！</p>

<h3>羅店前線平靜無事敵軍分兩路進犯劉行</h3>
<p>我軍分頭迎擊固守原來陣地　黃興路昨夜激戰敵不支潰退　圖窮匕見敵機散發荒謬傳單</p>
<p>我軍自以主力部隊集中在第一道防綫後、敵軍現取中央突破計劃、以劉行爲攻擊之目標、昨夜十二時後、敵分兩路進犯、一由羅店東面之淑里橋向南犯張家宅、謝宅、及吳宅、一由劉行東北面之代家宅、李家店、向小朱家宅、朱宅、及金家灣進攻、冀圖衝破我警界綫、集中兵力、突擊劉行之中心點、昨夜戰事異常激烈、淑里橋方面南犯之敵、當卽被我軍擊退、我仍固守原來陣地、朱宅與小朱家宅方面、接戰更烈、敵砲兵亦集中轟擊、我軍奮勇抵抗、無如敵軍砲火密集、朱宅及小朱宅曾一度失守、退至金家灣與敵隔河作戰、我以重機關槍與小鋼砲對敵密結掃射、一方面則由楊木橋方面抄襲敵軍後路、激戰至今農三時、敵軍不支而退、我軍仍規復朱宅小朱宅之原來陣地、羅店鎭方面、昨夜並無戰事、閘北方面亦僅有小接觸、乘敵軍換防時、我軍用步槍機關槍對敵射擊、敵軍一時手慌脚亂、倉皇應付、死亡甚衆、虹口公園方面之敵軍砲隊、則不時開砲向我陣地轟擊、時斷時續、目的僅在擾亂及警戒性質、於我毫無損失、又敵軍企圖破壞我後方交通、昨日不斷以砲轟滬西中山路、祇以目標不準、並無損壞、</p>
<h3>戰訊簡報</h3>
<p>匯山區域以北、機關槍步槍及重砲聲澈夜未停、晚八時至九時間、八字橋附近及北站一帶、均有激戰、寶山路附近亦有砲火、惟砲聲尚稀、西區及浦江中寂靜無事、今晨七時四十五分、北站附近有機關槍聲、連續可聞、七時五十五分、敵飛機一架飛往南市散放傳單、七時半至八時間、江灣北面砲火頗烈、八時至十時間、虹口公園附近（卽敵軍司令部北面）有一處起火、閘北商務印書館舊廠附近會受轟擊、九時至十時間、寶山路寶通路附近均有砲火、</p>
<h3>敵犯劉行經我擊潰</h3>
<p>以威脅我第一道防綫　我分頭截擊斃敵甚多</p>
<p>敵進犯羅店計劃失敗後、昨起改變目標、向劉行侵犯、進行其中央突破之企圖、以威脅我第一道防綫、該處位於羅店大塲之間、爲滬太公路之一重鎭、我軍早加準備、紮有重兵、敵自昨晚（十九日）十時起、係分兩路進犯、一部向我劉行之北前方吳宅陣地猛攻、經我迎頭痛擊、未有進展、另一方面則以極精銳之部隊、藉鐵甲車多輛之掩護、向劉行前方我朝王廟、朱宅、小朱宅、之警戒綫猛攻、我以機關槍掃射、斃敵甚多、敵雖遭打擊、仍圖頑進、我軍勁强異常、紛紛出壕肉搏、苦戰逾一小時許、卒爲敵突破陣綫、我軍乃略行後退、在金家灣憑小浜之兩岸與敵對峙、旋我生力軍趕到、越浜衝鋒、與敵肉搏多次、前仆後繼、有進無退、終將敵擊退、恢復原有警戒綫、是役敵我各以精銳部隊奮勇肉搏、達數小時之久、故雙方損失、均甚重大、但我卒能恢復原有陣地、而生力部隊仍源源開到、卽下令反攻云、</p>
<h3>敵犯閘北慘敗而回</h3>
<p>敵司令部附近中彈起火</p>
<p>八字橋及北站附近一帶、敵軍於昨晚八時許突以密集部隊、向該綫一帶進犯、同時敵軍砲火亦集向該處作漫無標的之轟擊、希冀壓迫我軍後方、但均無效、我軍除亟起應戰外、我後方砲兵亦予猛烈之還擊、相戰約一小時許、虹口公園敵軍司令部附近、被我砲擊中起火、在今晨七時四十分許、又有敵軍一小部隊向北站附近進襲、當被我軍以機關槍掃蕩、敵傷亡十餘名退却、未畿、又復進窺、仍被我軍擊退、我軍仍持原陣綫、</p>
<h3>黃興路昨夜有激戰</h3>
<p>敵兩次來犯均被我擊退</p>
<p>市中心區之敵約千餘名、於昨日午夜藉其重砲掩護、向黃興路寗國路方面我軍陣地作猛烈之進攻、鐵甲車數輛、爲其先導、我軍鎭靜以待、俟其將近、卽以手溜彈迫擊砲小鋼砲迎頭痛擊、敵見鐵甲車失去效用、卽以步兵來衝、我軍乃躍出戰壕、以白刃與敵肉搏、敵受挫傷、立卽退却、但未幾又來、我軍卽以機關槍等輕重火器、密集掃射、并奮發神威、衝入敵陣、左衝右突、予敵重創、敵軍見勢不支、亟亟增援、而我後方生力軍亦及時趕到、於是激戰又復開始、機關槍步槍以及重砲之聲、澈夜未停、直戰至今晨拂曉前、敵以傷亡過重、仍不支而退、我軍固守原陣地、</p>
<h3>敵退守羅店鎭東北</h3>
<p>待援補充前綫沉寂</p>
<p>敵軍三次總攻羅店、經我奮勇抗戰、迭受重創、其部隊雖再度進據該鎭、惟在敵密集砲火及任意焚毀之餘、已無完棟、且受我小堂子方面重兵之威脅、不敢頑守、故亦退至鎭之東北一帶佈防、待援補充中、故前綫戰事沉寂、間以大砲向我後方陣地轟擊、但我並無損毀、</p>
<h3>浦東我軍擊退敵軍</h3>
<p>今晨敵機十二架飛浦東偵察</p>
<p>日方對浦東我軍陣地、尙未採取攻勢、昨晚全綫沉寂、僅浦中敵艇往返遊弋、我軍在各口岸均嚴陣以待、間惟發生雙方互用機槍掃射、並無激烈行動、今晨九時、有敵機十二架、分爲四隊、盤旋於其昌棧一帶、不時用機槍掃射、同時浦江日艦、亦開砲助戰、至十時卽歸平息、我方並未受損、</p>
<h3>敵機一架墮落浦江</h3>
<p>敵機五十一架今晨西飛</p>
<p>昨日天甫黎明、有敵機多架、飛浦東一帶我陣地窺察、其中有水上機一架、被我機槍擊傷、倉遽間擬逃往淞口、無奈飛至三井碼頭附近時、受損機身、因受劇烈震動、致中途不支、跌落於三井碼頭浦面、旋卽沉沒、</p>
<p>路息、敵機昨兩度進襲首都、毫無結果、今晨（二十日）又有敵機五十一架、結隊沿鐵路綫西上、約十一時經過崑山、繼續西飛云、</p>
<h3>敵軍死亡已逾兩萬</h3>
<p>久留米師團殆已全部解决　五次援軍一師團日內抵滬</p>
<p>大公社云、軍息、自八月十三日滬戰发生迄今、敵軍之死亡人數、總計在二萬人以上、此外空軍之戰死者、尙不在內、同時傷亡最慘重者、爲首先犯我吳淞·張華浜·獅子林·羅店一帶之敵軍久留米師團、因該批敵軍、迭遭我軍痛擊、幾無一生還者、至盤據虹口區之敵海軍特別陸戰隊、亦幾全軍覆沒、故此次敵軍侵滬之損失、實開中日戰局中之最高紀錄云、又據關係方面接得報告、敵軍第五次增援部隊、計有一師團、現已分由長崎神戶等地動員、約明後日可抵此、</p>
<h3>敵機又發荒謬傳單</h3>
<p>敵機兩架、於今晨七時半、飛越租界而至南市一帶、盤旋偵察、並散發荒謬無恥之傳單、該項敵機、飛經南市斜橋以南、至龍華路一帶、折而向浦東方面飛去、惟敵機在低飛時、輒以機槍爲斷續之掃射行人、但今日上午則未投彈、</p>
<p>今（二十）晨九時許、敵機十餘架、又在浦東滬南等處窺探、在眞如中山路等處投彈十餘枚、希圖破壞我後方交通、但我損毀甚微、旋該機十七架集合後、向東南方面飛去、</p>
<h3>千餘敵屍載運返日</h3>
<p>車行各路血漬斑然</p>
<p>據確息、十八日晚十一時、有敵卡車三十餘輛、每輛皆載有以黑布捆扎之敵死屍三四十具、上覆油布、由吳淞路、經過百老匯路駛楊樹浦碼頭、倉遽間起運至停泊該處之敵運輸輪上海丸上、裝運返國、據目擊者談、該批卡車之最後一輛、所載者多爲斷足殘臂、軀體不全之敵屍、鮮血淋漓、且有露出油布以外者、厥狀之慘、不忍卒觀、昨日有人經過該項卡車行經各路時、尙見血漬斑然、直至楊樹浦碼頭爲止、而估計該批敵軍死屍之總數、當在千具以上云、</p>
<h3>敵機一架在錫降落</h3>
<p>［無錫］十九晨十時、敵機一架襲京受創、降落縣屬福星鎭江灘、機師二人泅水圖逃、開槍拒捕、當被壯丁擊斃、壯丁亦有一人受傷、（十九日專電）</p>
<h3>連雲港外敵艦他駛徐州</h3>
<p>海訊、連雲港外之敵艦、於我封鎖海口後、業經他駛、惟水上機時飛連雲上空偵察、十五晨被我高射砲擊傷其尾部、落於外海、（十九日專電）</p>
<h3>敵方危言聳聽謂南京已成危險區域</h3>
<p>將派大隊敵機前往轟炸　敵方通知各國僑民遷避</p>
<p>日本海軍第三艦隊司令官長谷川、於本月十九日下午、向駐滬各國使領、致送節路、聲明日本海軍航空隊、將於本月二十一日午後、轟炸我國首都、請各國使領、立卽通知旅京僑民、一律於是日午前退避至安全地點以免遭受危險、所有駐泊在該處之各國兵艦及商輪、亦請駛至揚子江上游云云、</p>
<p>又聞各國駐滬領團、定於今日下午開會討論此事、以便决定方針、答復日方、又悉法國方面、絕對不作遷避之計云、</p>
<p>確息、法國駐滬總領事、今日上午答復日方稱、法國在南京之大使館及領事館、與在下關江面之軍艦、不能撤退、所有法國在中國首都之權益、應請加以注意等語、</p>
<h3>華北日軍包圍企圖失敗</h3>
<p>平南我大軍佈置完固　津浦綫左翼發生激戰　興濟站敵軍業已退却</p>
<p>［濟南］今正面無變化、左翼我生力軍某部與敵激戰甚烈、肉搏殺敵甚多、曾奪回數村、因無工事、仍回原陣地、我某團到興濟站南二三里、興濟站敵已退走、我扼守站南娘娘河、興濟馬廠路員已奉命準備回站、敵機數架、今早到滄州站投彈、傷一人、電綫被炸、一經桑園窺探本市興齊河、下午四點有二十一架過臨沂滕縣窺徐州、旋飛返海州、又三架到興濟南掃射、同時敵鐵甲車到興濟南、今晚似欲攻擊、但已被我鐵甲車擊退、又李樓殘敵八十餘、已被我圍困、（十九日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］據此間日本軍司令部宣稱、日軍向北平迤南、繼續進展、同時承認華軍向西南方面移動、秩序極爲優良、此間指陳、日軍包圍企圖之失敗、已經日方證實、山西方面、華軍陣地極固、日軍屢犯未逞云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［天津］據此間今日所接消息、日軍在華北包圍中國軍隊之企圖、已經證實失敗、北平迤南五十公哩處之華軍五萬人、已籍大雨中、佈置完固、日軍　用機化部隊轟炸追擊、但未達到所期勝利、且對於華軍之改變陣地、認爲華方戰略、不可捉摸、因此頗感疑懼云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［北平］據海通社記者親往北平與平漢路間之日本陣地視察、申稱日軍之路綫、可從彈穴、及敗瓦頹垣、尋其去向、華軍所掘深溝、用以阻碍坦克車者、觸目皆是、但戰塲並不見陣亡官兵之死屍、因均爲雙方所掩埋故也、該記者繼稱、日軍之包圍企圖失敗、可於星期六涿州失陷之時、俘虜甚少一事證明之、蓋華軍在日軍入城之前十二小時、已經在整齊之步調中、完全撤空、而其他各處日軍之進犯、則遭華軍猛烈堅强之抵抗云云、（三十日國民社）</p>
<h3>柏林舉行防空演習</h3>
<p>全市總動員　情景極緊張</p>

<h3>敵軍殘暴行爲</h3>
<p>德興里居民被刺致死　東區七百工人被槍殺</p>
<p>敵軍之殘暴行爲、層見疊出、無辜民衆之慘遭殺害者、不知凡計、本月十六日匯司捕房曾在海甯路北江西路口德興里、査獲一年約三十歲之華籍男子、係爲步槍殺害、乃相隔三日、於昨日土午十時、匯司捕房又在該德興里二十七號門牌內、査獲一年三十餘歲之男子、死於屋內、察得係用刺刀致死、經報請第一特區法院、委派張宗儒檢察官法醫張炎、檢騐結果、騐得該男尸左手大指虎口部份、有刺刀傷一處、腹部腕部有刺刀傷一處、右背部有刺刀傷一處、委係被刺刀殺死、査無屍屬、故諭飭普善山莊收埋、據悉該里内、尚有一部份居民留居於內云、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>語曰“隨機應變。”所謂隨機應變者。卽是見機趨避之意。機者飛機也。應變者趨避也。今淞滬戰爭。至爲劇烈。或敵機來襲。或我機出動。路人駐足仰觀。或升屋項遙望。此種冒險精神。固可欽佩。但恐流彈所及。不免無謂犧牲。大可不必。故隨機應變四字。不妨作歪曲解焉。在此大砲飛機殺人如麻之下。我人生命。本同螻蟻。原不足惜。然與其犧牲於街衢屋頂之間。甯願犧牲於前綫戰壕之上。較爲值得。與其觀望而犧牲。不若殺敵而犧牲。一樣犧牲。兩樣估價。</p>

<h3>沉痛的回憶（八）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊇逃亡</p>
<p>能夠從奴隸的地位上逃亡出來的人，和那些熬受着奴隸生活的比，還算幸運的哩！</p>
<p>記者個人，本來打算的南來行期，是在七月初。其後，因了種種緣故，一再地拖延着，拖廷着，……（大家以為，時局雖然緊張，但風勢總會看的，到不行的時候，奔走吧。）然而，突的一下，像一個風箏斷了綫似的，古城被抓到敵人手裹去了！這時，我簡直像一個關在玻璃屋裹的蒼蠅：到處亂撞。</p>
<p>我終天在外面跑，宣稱着：無論如何，也要離開這敵人的後方。我打算化裝由小路逃走，又打算從高粱地裹鑽出去，又打算……朋友們見面所談的，也全是逃走的方法，但姑終也發現不了妥當的。</p>
<p>“我相信，你的急於離開此地，絕不是僅為了逃難！”我的一個最知己的朋友陶君，為了寬慰我起見，好幾次地，這麼對我說。</p>
<p>“我一定努力不使你的盛意辜負！”我堅決地。</p>
<p>七月五日，平津　火車，第一日恢復通行。我趕緊向中國旅行社買一張票，打算六號走。然而———</p>
<p>“那是不妥當的：”我的一位親戚勸阻了我。“船票不打聽好，到天津去住着，比這兒還要危險哩！”</p>
<p>車票退還了旅行社，同時，托他們打電報到天津，訂購到上海去的艙位。電報由無綫電轉拍了出去以後，一兩天沒有回電，八號起，無綫電也不通了。好在同樣情形的人很多，於是，旅行社决定派人到天津去，專辦這件事。</p>
<p>在這幾天之內，我有許多朋友走開了。我問：“船票沒有辦法，天津去耗着斡嗎呀？”</p>
<p>一致的回答是：多挨出一步去好一步。”</p>
<p>旅行社的人，從天津回來了，答覆許多圍著他問消息的人們的，是一連串的搖頭和擺手：“沒辦法！沒辦法！有沒有船，還不一定，票子更難說了。”</p>
<p>賸下來的辦法，祗好是“挨出一步去好一步”的這條路了。十一號一大早，從打着架似的人羣裹，好容易在旅行社買了一張票。票子買到手後，滿身汁是不用說的，連襯衣的扣子，也擠掉子一個。十三號早晨五點鐘，我自以為很早地到了車站。然而，車站上早已擠滿了人羣，據說有一兩天上不了車，就露宿在站上的。月台標不賣了。送我上車的，祗有一位陶君。他為了送我，一夜沒有睡，三點鐘就到了站。車子規定是七點開，一直到九點還沒有開出去。我和陶君在月台上踱子幾十次來回，左右前後，來來往往的，全是敵軍和浪人之類，我們彼此什麼話也不敢說；而且，什麼也說不出，有一種要嘔吐似的難受。為了减少這種痛苦，不等車開，我就勸陶君回去。</p>
<p>“那末，再見了！”陶君伸出了手。</p>
<p>“再見！再見！”我堅强握着他的手。</p>
<p>我們意味深長地，互相說了幾十個“再見。”—我說的“再見，”是意味着他的南來，和我們站在一條戰綫上的那一天。</p>
<p>我坐的這輛餐車裹，連桌上也坐的是人。沒有坐位了，我祇好站着。然而，開車前的幾分鐘，忽然有個苦力模樣的人，向我打交道：“要位子吧，先生？三塊錢。”</p>
<p>“兩塊怎樣？”我還價。</p>
<p>“剛剛那位老太太，”他指一指那邊，“還花了五塊哩”。</p>
<p>坐下來更難受：那站在我旁邊的人們，簡直成了“肉屏風”，檔得一絲風也不透。滿車是汗臭氣。我的邊旁，剛剛站着兩側守車的日本兵，有股非常討厭的汗味傳過來，這兩倒矮而寬胖的脚色，滿身是累累贅贅的鋼盛，水壺，刺刀之類，還時刻不寗地轉動着身子，這，令我非常警惕起來了：我拚命躱讜着，不使我碰到他們身上的任何物件。因為，我親眼看到：有一位乘客進來，碰了他們的水壺一下，道着歉，道着歉，還被他們用手在頸子上拚命一叉。另有一位，下車時擦了下他們的肩背，就被提起皮鞋，在屁股上蹴了一下，以致踉蹌了一丈多遠，還發子一聲“哎唷”。有時，他們把槍端平了，對着人業，將子彈裝進槍膛，然後，又一顆一顆地跳出來；一遇到子彈卡住了，就嘰嘰咕咕地罵着，一面用手拚命拍着“槍閂”，要是一個“失手走火”，那末被他擊倒的人們，會像一串魚似的，一齊倒下去的吧。全車人，在提心吊膽地，為這個說不准什麼時候就會發生的慘劇憂慮着。沿途車停的次數，是算不淸的，有時為了讓敵軍的兵車，有時為了檢查；有時什麼也不為地被敵軍阻止了，停不久，又命令快些開走。這一天，據說因為車上人擠得太多了，查起來麻煩，所以，比起前些時來，檢查次數還算少的。車子過豐台，廊房，楊村！等地的時候，有大羣大羣由南口潰下來的敵軍，在鐵道兩旁坐着，有的沒有帽子，有的失去了子彈帶，有的甚至掉了一隻鞋，光着一隻脚板，在碎石上面走來走去，……那狼狽，是可想見的。</p>
<p>火車到天津東站的時候，是七點半。本來是火車三小時的行程，現在，約走了整整十個鐘頭。然而，却是自通車以來最快的記綠，就在這前一天的火車，走到當天夜裹十二點多才到的。車站出口的地方，有十多個敵軍對面立着，槍平夾在腋下，又上了刺刀；乘客呢，就側着身子，從這不到二尺距離的簇簇的刺刀尖之間，走出站。記者沒有被查，有些人却被查得很嚴，不知是什麼標凖。也許是看樣子的吧？—我想。我又想：那末，什麼樣子才有檢查的必要呢？是保安隊的樣子吧？（後來聽說，就在前些天，有一位旅客，已經被查過出站了，忽然被風一飄，長衫下面露出條黃褲子，於是從後面，就被敵軍擊了一槍，完給了生命。當時大家不明了什麼道理，後來想到，大槪因為穿保安隊一樣的褲子了吧。）是中央直屬機關人員的樣子吧，是文化界人士的樣子吧？是共產黨樣子吧！是藍衣社樣子吧……我一面想，一面替自己高興：大槪我扮得和上面這幾種人，完全兩樣了，因而就免除了檢查。非常高興地坐在洋車上，在路上走着，……正在高興的，忽然路旁吆喝了一聲。</p>
<p>一個“友邦兵士跑過來了，手指着我的箱子。我連忙陪着笑臉，打開箱子請他看，他翻了翻，全是衣服；而外，什麼也沒有，他把手一揚，又用我不懂的話，向車夫大吼了一聲，那意思，大槪是呌快些滾開吧。</p>
<p>洋車拉到法國橋時，已經戒嚴了，進不了法租界。我下來想打電話我朋友。拿通行證來接。然而借了幾處，才知道電綫全被日軍割斷了。祇好準備和其餘幾百位難友一般的，暫且在法國橋畔露宿一夜。</p>
<p>天津的法國橋畔，那天晚上，瀰漫着孩子們的哭和病人們的哼。而日本軍用汽車，却不斷地從近處衝來衝去；經過這裹時，就把速度放慢了，用電筒向人業慢慢地移動着，照了過去。</p>
<p>九點多鐘時，忽然降下了暴雨。頃刻間，法國橋畔的難民羣，就呈現了一幅哀號着掙扎着的悽慘的景象。我的箱子，在水面浮起來了。鞋子裹面灌滿了水，一走動，水花就一濺、而且一唧的響了一聲。身子濕得打戰，然而並不冷。一個站崗的法租界巡捕對我說，那樣過一夜，是危險的：第一，日本兵說不定會向難民開槍的，第二，淋一夜也會出毛病。那末，“有什麼辦法呢？”我問了。於是，他就呌我候在橋旁，停一會搭外國人的汽車走。果然，不一會，他呌住了一輛正在開着的汽車嘰咕了幾句，呌我付五塊錢，然後，讓我提着箱子上了車，從面容和身影上看，這開車的大槪是一個俄國人。車子到法國橋前入口處時，一個法國巡捕上前來看了一看，這個開車的俄國人，把頭由車窗裹伸出去一下，就一點也不阻攔地、開了過去。</p>
<p>朋友李君家裹，樓上下祇有五六間屋，這時候，住了由北平逃來的四五家，給我的印象，就是簇簇的到處全是人。當我皺了皺眉頭，問李君附近有什麼旅館時，他立刻明瞭我的意思，笑起來了：“哈哈，我知道你是嫌這兒太擠的。可是，這租界上，那個旅館都擠得滿滿的，連樓梯下面都住的是人。”這一夜，祇好在樓板上暫且睏了。</p>
<p>船是個大問題。住在天津等船的，大槪有八九萬人吧。最受歡迎的，自然是英國怡和太古兩公司的船；然而已公告開船期的祇有用隻船。船票是前十天就賣光了。除此而外，有在兩條野雞輪船，或者可以開，但是日期也不一定。我到處託人代覓船票，祇要有人肯轉讓，幾倍價餞，我都願意出。最後，是覓到了一張，乘野雞船到烟台去的船票。票價原來是一元半，原買的人花了八元半，而讓給我的代價，却是二十四塊。</p>
<p>李君不贊成我這樣做、第一，這是條走私貨的船，船長是日本人，坐牠太冒險了；第二，船期也不知是那天哩！我却以為：正因為是走私的船，反倒保險些，也說不定；其次，那天開，就那天走好了，反正另外也別無辦法。——說老實的，我對於能不能坐這條船走，目不大存什麼奢望的。</p>
<p>然而，徼倖得很，這條船第四天就開了，而且平平安安地把我送到烟台。除掉在大沽，塘沽後，曾受軍艦上的日兵恐嚇地對着呌喚了幾次，以及船上人太擠而外，總算是相當滿意。</p>
<p>連頭連尾，共總六天，我就由北平到達烟台了。聽見我坐的船名號，烟台的朋友們，都伸伸舌頭，以為我太冒險；但替我算算日期，又一致說我是走的更快。</p>
<p>呼吸着自由空氣的時候，不由地，想念起北平城，和那裹面沒有逃出來的人們。（九，十四，在上海）</p>

<h3>日本政界惑星“宇垣一成”（下）</h3>
<p>— 斐丹</p>
<p>至於宇垣和政黨的關係，當然是比較密切；因為他曾經歷任五次內閣的陸相，和黨人的接觸較多，而且他任陸相的時候，正是日本政黨政治甚為得勢，他受政黨的影響，實在也不少，所以他也比較有政治手腕。但是文官黨人尚且可以做首相，難道與政黨有關係的軍人，倒不能做首相嗎？當然理由是不充分的。實際上是宇垣的手腕太利害，在他的傘下，眞有謀士如雲之概，如果宇垣上台，則少壯派軍人，是有被壓倒的危險，這是他們堅决反對宇垣的原因。</p>
<p>至於說宇垣的勢力圈，究竟有多少大，說來實在可驚，在日本是無出其右者；他的勢力，是在財界，政界，軍界，官僚，新聞界，無化不入的，在任何方面都有擁護宇垣的分子。只要政局一有波紋，就有財閥來出活動費，軍人代他買力，新聞雜誌來替他鼓吹，政客黨人來把他聯絡各方面，官僚來為他捧場，頃刻之間，會全體動員起來；但是一切努力，總敵不過少壯派軍人的槍桿兒。因爲他們的槍桿兒，曾經槍殺財閥主腦井上準之助團琢磨，把濱口雄幸，犬養毅血染首相官邸，並起事東京，殺戳了高橋是淸，齊藤實渡邊錠太郎等，這是不能不使人有所顧慮的，所以宇垣勢力縱大，也不能事如人意。</p>
<p>元老西園寺，和重臣集團的器重宇垣，是不必說了，現在為大家易終明瞭起見，把各方面與宇垣有開的主要人物寫在下面：</p>
<p>軍部方面，南次郎，二宮治重，寺內壽一，阿部信行，杉山元。</p>
<p>政黨方面：屬於民政黨的有，川崎克，富田幸次郎，山道襄一，小山壽松，櫻內幸雄，池田秀雄，永井柳太郎，牧山耕藏，鈴木富士彌，淸水長鄕，賴田木桂吉等，屬於政友會的有，砂田重政，河野一郎，岡田忠彥，星島郎，山本悌一郎，鳩山一郎等；屬於社會大衆黨的有麻久，龜井貫太郎；現在無所屬的望月圭介，秋田淸小泉三申等。</p>
<p>貴族院方面：有研究會的靑木信光，溝口直亮，石黑忠篤，有馬賴寗；官僚派的伊澤多喜男，井上醫男，田大次郎，松木學；及阿部房次郎等。</p>
<p>財閥方面：為宇垣出政治資金的，主要的為關西財閥，有住友的小倉正恒，根津系的稻烟勝太郎，安宅彌吉，東洋紡織系統的阿部房次郎，坂男斡太，關西信託系統的加藤小太郎；朝鮮財閥的野口遵；岡山財閥，馬越恭平，大原孫三郎，岡崎眞一郎，服部和一郎，藤田聯藏，尾崎邦三等，及三菱系，安川系的人物。</p>
<p>至新聞方面，與財閥政黨有關係，差不多都擁護宇垣的，無庸詳說了</p>
<p>宇垣雖然擁有如此龐大的勢力，但是結果還是不能如願的組織內閣，這很明白的表露出日本軍部少壯派猖獗的畸形政治狀態。過去日本的到外戰爭，雖然可以使日本國內趨於統一，但是現在日本的對外戰爭，却要促進日本國內的分裂，現在宇垣遭暗殺的消息，雖然未能證實，倘若是眞實的，則日本在此次對我侵略戰爭中，他的政治的分裂，必定是意外的早。在軍事行動之下，日本雖有暫時軍部獨裁的可能，可是他的結果，不過促進軍閥勢力的更快的崩潰罷了。</p>
<h3>壯哉“老子軍”的建議</h3>

<p>前錢忠勇殺賊的將士，浴血鏖戰。衰翁枯坐斗室，攢眉賦詩，這是多麼慚愧！多麼罪過！日者側聞張一麡先生有“老子軍”的建議，何其壯也！因賦三首。</p>
<p>正是天坍地塌時，吞聲歌哭亦頑痴。健兒報國能湔恥，父老猶深壯往思。</p>
<p>努力同揮逐日戈，會當整頓舊山河。扶衰返老同心力，如此精神總不磨！</p>

<h3>Entire Front Quiet with Only Minor Contact</h3>
<p>Enemy Suffered Over 10,000 Deaths in Three General Offensives; Our Second Counterattack at Yong'an Bridge Victorious; We Maintain Original Line and Remain in Superior Position</p>
<p>Over the past week, the enemy has exerted all its strength, issuing orders for a full-line general offensive. Our loyal and brave soldiers on all fronts met them head-on, inflicting over 10,000 enemy deaths. Morale was greatly diminished, and the extent of the damage was unprecedented since the start of the Shanghai battles. Currently, the enemy appears to be actively reorganizing its remaining forces and mobilizing reinforcements, attempting a final struggle. Our army is also committed to a calm and steadfast defense, adhering to the principle of waiting for the enemy to exhaust themselves. Therefore, yesterday, the entire front was relatively quiet with only minor contact. Small enemy units continuously harassed our positions, but were repeatedly repelled by our forces. These actions were likely reconnaissance in nature and unrelated to the overall battle situation. Yesterday at 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, our forces launched a second counterattack on the enemy's Yong'an Bridge position. Our artillery units provided support, and the enemy, caught off guard, retreated after being unable to withstand the assault. A considerable amount of baggage and supplies were seized. Shortly thereafter, we returned to our original defensive positions. In the Luodian and Liuhang areas, our front line remained completely unchanged. In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, sporadic machine gun and rifle fire occurred, becoming more intense after 1:00 AM this morning. We firmly hold our original positions and maintain a superior advantage. It is anticipated that in the coming days, the enemy will once again use all its naval, land, and air forces to attack our Luodian and Liuhang lines. We are conserving our strength and are determined to engage the stubborn enemy in a decisive battle again.</p>
<p>Over the past week, there have been no major changes on either side of the front line. The enemy is currently focusing all its efforts on attacking Luodian and Liuhang. Since the fall of Luodian, our forces in that area are now holding positions in areas such as Wudoujing, Nanbeitang, and Beizhudian, engaging the enemy in a stalemate. The enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses in recent days. East of Liuhang, our forces are holding Chaowang Temple and Jinjiawan. North of Gujiazhai, our forces are in Yangmuqiao East and Luzhai. The enemy has occupied Yong'an Bridge. Yesterday afternoon, our forces launched a counterattack against the enemy in Yanghang. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly, we advanced to Yong'an Bridge. This location has been the site of the most intense enemy attacks since our forces shifted their lines on the 13th of this month. In the northern Jiangwan area, our forces are defending the line of Yanjiawan (along the Yunzaobing), Lujiaqiao Village, Lingnan School, and Ye's Garden. Both sides have built deep trenches and high ramparts, and there have been no major battles in recent days. Only daily exchanges of gunfire between sentries have occurred. The enemy forces in that area are all Northeastern compatriots who were coerced into service and belong to the units of traitors Zhang Haipeng and Li Shouxin. It is believed that if given the opportunity, they would defect and return to our side. According to a staff officer of the XXXXXX unit, the reason our forces have not completely eliminated the enemy in the past month is due to the enemy's reliance on naval gunnery and aerial bombardment, which caused us some casualties. Since moving to the new front lines, we have installed anti-aircraft machine guns and cannons in various locations. As soon as enemy aircraft are spotted, they are engaged. Therefore, in recent days, very few enemy aircraft have flown over our positions. Those that do occasionally fly over hover at high altitudes. They are not as brazen as before, which shows that they are timid and dare not attempt anything rash.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Third Major Defeat Since the Outbreak of the Shanghai Battle</h3>
<p>The Enemy Gambled Everything on the Eve of the September 18th Incident; Repeatedly Suffered Heavy Losses, Morale is Low, Awaiting Reinforcements</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the focus of the fighting in recent days has been on the Luodian line. After suffering setbacks in Hongkou and Yangshupu, the enemy resorted to the old "January 28th Incident" strategy, placing its main force to land at Liuhe, hoping to threaten our flank and rear. Unexpectedly, in the Battle of Luodian, they were almost completely annihilated by our forces and had to seek reinforcements from their homeland. Since the first of this month, they have once again brought their elite naval, land, and air forces, as well as mechanized units, to forcibly land at Wusong and attack our positions near Beisitang and Yanghang. Our troops fought bravely and killed many enemy soldiers. In order to eliminate the enemy in one fell swoop, our forces gradually lured the enemy deeper into our territory. The enemy, believing victory was within their grasp, recklessly advanced rashly. Fierce battles have raged near Yong'an Bridge and Yangmuqiao in recent days. On the 17th, the enemy spared no effort, committing all its elite forces in a desperate gamble, hoping to have a decisive battle with us on the eve of the "September 18th Incident." However, our forces had already seen through their plot. Our frontline soldiers, loyal and brave for the country, spared no effort, sacrificing themselves and fighting as one against a hundred, giving the enemy a head-on blow. After several charges, the enemy was completely annihilated in front of our positions. This marks the enemy's third major defeat since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle. The enemy has repeatedly suffered heavy losses, its morale is low, and it dares not advance rashly, waiting for reinforcements and resupply.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Fierce Battles in the Yanghang, Yuepu, and Luodian Areas in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Talk by a Senior Military Officer</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency inspected the Shanghai front on September 18th and met with a senior military officer who provided a detailed account of the recent fierce battles in the Yanghang, Yuepu, and Luodian areas. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month, the enemy's 3rd, 6th, 11th, 12th, 16th, and newly added 9th Divisions, utilizing their superior naval and air forces, launched the third phase of their general offensive against us. Their main force attacked the center of our positions from Yanghang and Yuepu, along both sides of the Douliu-Douluo Highway, attempting to cut off the Shanghai-Taicang Highway before September 18th, consolidate Wusong and Shanghai, and use a portion of their forces to break through our encirclement of Luodian from the Luodian and Xiaochuansha areas.</p>
<p>On the 13th and 14th, fierce battles of attrition were fought with our forces in places such as Gujia Pavilion, Xujia Pavilion, and Yong'an Bridge. Our soldiers are resolved to live and die with their positions. When the enemy infantry approached, they were met with counterattacks, killing many enemy soldiers. Corpses littered the field, and their attack made no progress. This was the enemy's first setback. After dusk on the 14th, taking advantage of the enemy's fatigue, we launched a full-line counterattack. The fighting was especially fierce in the Luodian area. The enemy troops in areas such as Changqiao, Liuweiqiao, Panjiaqiao Station were all defeated by our forces. The waters of the Jiejing River were stained red. Luodian was completely burned down. We captured an enemy regimental flag from the 22nd Regiment and seized many important military orders and documents. According to a diary of a certain officer, in ten days of fierce fighting, each company suffered more than half casualties.</p>
<p>On the 16th, the enemy reorganized its remaining forces, using the Taiwan Garrison to reinforce Luodian and launch another attack. Due to cloudy, foggy weather and heavy rain, the enemy air force lost its effectiveness. Our army's morale soared, and we often used our main force to launch counterattacks from the front. Fierce battles were fought with the enemy in the areas of Nanbeitangkou, Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Luodian. Because our infantry and artillery coordination was effective, and the mortars had a great effect, about a regiment of the enemy attacking our Zhangjiayan collapsed immediately. At the same time, our anti-aircraft guns in Jiading and in front of our positions in Jinjiawan shot down an enemy bomber each. The enemy suffered extremely heavy deaths on this day. This was the enemy's second setback.</p>
<p>On the 17th, the enemy added one of its newly arrived divisions to the Yanghang front and launched a final general offensive, recklessly attacking our positions repeatedly with dense formations. We used machine guns to mow them down, killing countless enemy soldiers. Our positions remained unshaken. At this time, our fresh troops arrived and immediately joined the counterattack from the areas of Yangmuqiao, Jinjiazhai, and Beizhuqiao, sweeping the enemy. By 12:00 PM, the enemy was completely routed. Since the morning of the 18th, the enemy has retreated completely. The corpses of the enemy are scattered everywhere in the Yanghang, Yong'an Bridge, and Jinjiawan areas, covering an area of more than ten miles. The scene of their utter defeat can be imagined. It is estimated that in six days of fierce fighting with the enemy, we have killed tens of thousands of enemy soldiers. This is the detailed account of the enemy's disastrous defeat in the third phase of their general offensive. The enemy, with their arrogance, no longer has the ability to attack again.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Raids the Enemy, Inflicting Great Damage</h3>
<p>Western Newspapers Report the Facts of the Damage; Shanghai Textile Company Also Bombed</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that from 6:50 PM to 9:00 PM and again from 11:00 PM to after midnight on the 18th, Shanghai experienced an unprecedented aerial bombardment in its history. Chinese planes dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on the Yangshupu, Hongkou, and Broadway areas, causing fires in several locations. The planes swooped down from the clear moonlit sky and dropped bombs at low altitudes, showing unprecedented bravery. At that time, there were as many as nine fires. A bomb struck the Shanghai Textile Company, which is run by the Japanese, causing a fierce fire. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the Shanghai Textile Mill is one of the largest Japanese-owned textile mills in China. The Japanese are now using it as a military concentration point. The extent of the damage inside the factory is unknown. A spinning room at the Ewo Mill also caught fire after being hit by a bomb, but it was extinguished by Indian guards. According to the Shanghai Times, during the Chinese air raid on Yangshupu and other places on the evening of the 18th, a bomb hit a Japanese gunboat. The Japanese military positions in Yangshupu also suffered heavy damage.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that our air force raided enemy ships in Shanghai last night and bombed enemy military positions. In addition to hitting one enemy ship (another ship was hit by artillery shells) and destroying a large quantity of enemy military supplies, it was also learned that many enemy military vehicles, tanks, and armored vehicles were parked on vacant lots on East Xihua Road and Zhaofeng Road, which were also destroyed by our forces.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of the Enemy's Disastrous Defeat in Liuhang</h3>
<p>Remaining Enemy Forces at Yangmuqiao Completely Defeated; Enemy Corpses Pile Up Along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway</p>
<p>The battle report from Liuhang was received yesterday and is as follows: (1) On the 17th, three enemy regiments launched a fierce artillery bombardment on our line from Yangmuqiao to Chaowang Temple, east of Liujiaxing. From afternoon to dusk, a portion of the enemy infantry advanced towards our positions. Our forces immediately retaliated, launching a counterattack charge, engaging in melee combat several times. After fierce fighting until about 10:00 PM that night, the enemy forces were finally completely defeated. Enemy corpses were piled up like mountains along both sides of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. The enemy in the Xiaozhuzhai area was subjected to concentrated artillery fire and heavy bombardment, suffering extremely heavy losses.

<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Pudong and Other Areas</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning (the 19th), more than a dozen enemy planes flew from the northeast, circling over Pudong for a long time to conduct reconnaissance. They also fired indiscriminately with machine guns. They then dispersed to Zhabei, West Shanghai, South Shanghai, Longhua, and other areas to conduct reconnaissance before leaving at around 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>More than thirty enemy planes flew to the Pudong area from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM yesterday morning, indiscriminately bombing. However, the victims were civilians. Almost half of the houses in Yangjing Town and Qichangzhan in Pudong were destroyed. Because the area had become a war zone, most of the residents had already fled, so there were few casualties. However, a small squadron of enemy planes fired machine guns and dropped bombs in the Nanmatou, Dongjiadu, and Yangjiadu areas. Many civilian houses in the Pudong Xinmalu area were destroyed. There were many villagers in the rear of each of these areas, and it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, so there were more pedestrians than usual. It is estimated that there were more than a dozen injured, but fortunately there were no deaths.</p>
<p>Minhang</p>
<p>Minhang Town, which belongs to Shanghai County, is the largest town in the county. There is a wharf along the Huangpu River, which is the most prosperous area of the county. The most valuable area, the old street and front street, was bombed four times and is now completely rubble. Yesterday morning, enemy planes bombed the market tail of Minhang Town and the Zhugang area. As a result, the only undamaged and habitable areas in Minhang are in the more remote countryside.</p>
<p>Nanxiang</p>
<p>In the Nanxiang area, enemy planes have bombed Xianghuaqiao and South Street, the most prosperous areas, six times, reducing them to scorched earth. However, the house of a certain Mr. Fang, a wanted traitor in Xianghuaqiao, suffered no damage, and the wireless telegraph wires were not damaged either.</p>
<h3>Front Lines Quiet in Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the front lines in the Zhabei and Jiangwan Road areas were very quiet yesterday. Aside from occasional minor contact, there were no major battles all day.</p>
<p>The enemy in the Jiangwan area has been reinforced with newly arrived troops. Since the 17th, the enemy has been holed up in trenches, not daring to venture out. Therefore, the entire front has been quiet. At 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, the enemy suddenly launched a heavy artillery barrage on our positions at the North Station, the May 30th Cemetery, and Chi Chih University, which lasted until 6:30 AM. Our fortifications are solid, and there was no damage. In the area north of Sanmin Road, including Lijiaqiao and Sijing Ball Field, more than 300 enemy soldiers advanced towards our positions. They were met with a head-on interception and were repelled.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization in Baoshan City</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the various lines in Shanghai were quiet, and there were no fierce battles. Enemy troops attacked Liuhang in the early morning, and there was a dense sound of gunfire and artillery, but it stopped after half an hour. In the Baziqiao and Shuidian Road areas of Zhabei, the enemy used mortars as cover and launched attacks on our positions in batches. After our troops swept them with machine guns, they retreated in disarray. It has been learned that the enemy, in order to exploit traitors to facilitate deception, has organized a local maintenance association in Baoshan City. The association's headquarters is located in the City God Temple. It is said that it is organized by more than 30 traitors, including He Meisheng and Wang Zhengcai, who have boldly appeared as puppets and issued announcements to reassure the people, full of ridiculous and shameless statements. Fortunately, the residents of the area have long since fled, leaving only a small number of elderly, weak, and disabled people.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Continue to Transport Military Supplies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This morning (the 19th), before dawn, two more enemy transport ships, the Shanghai Maru and the Kasagi Maru, sailed into Shanghai and berthed at the Wayside Wharf to unload military supplies, which was a busy operation. The Liangyou Maru, the Jida Maru, the Fifth Unkai Maru, and another unnamed transport ship that had previously sailed into Shanghai remain berthed outside the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf and the Huangpu Wharf and have not yet sailed out. Currently, the warehouses at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha Wharf, the Huangpu China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, the Central Wharf, and the Wayside Wharf are all filled with enemy military supplies and materiel.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Five Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after our air force launched several night raids the night before last, the enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River mostly fled downstream towards Yangshupu and other areas.

<h3>Inside Story of the Tokyo Coup</h3>
<p>Ugaaki Resigned as General; Young Officers Believe It Was an Act of Defiance Against the Emperor</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: Although the authorities here have not explicitly announced the so-called Tokyo coup, its contents have been leaked, but not in detail. The assassinated general is General Ugaaki. When Ugaaki formed his cabinet last year, the military, because of his relationship with financial groups and different factions, did everything possible to block him. After failing, Ugaaki, in resentment, resigned his general's title as well, meaning, "Since I am not qualified to form a cabinet, I naturally cannot be a general either." Generals must command the three armed forces during wartime. Ugaaki knew that there was a lack of talented generals in the Japanese army. Logically, if something happened in the future, the military would use me as the main general. Therefore, he specifically resigned as general to show his resistance. And during this Shanghai battle, the naval landing force failed. When they planned to send the army, there was no suitable main general for a time. The military secretly probed Ugaaki's intentions, wanting him to come forward. Ugaaki refused, and was quite firm. The military then used Matsui to perfunctorily handle the war. On the other hand, the young officers were greatly angered by Ugaaki, saying that the general's title was granted by the Emperor, and was different from a scholar's degree. How could it be resigned? Resigning as general was defying the Emperor. Their motive for harming Ugaaki was precisely this.</p>
<h3>Talk by Former Ambassador to the United States Shih Chao-chi</h3>
<p>Enemy Military Atrocities Should Be Suppressed by International Action; The Extent to Which Countries Are Indulging Japan Is Cause for Concern; Our Relationship with the United States Is Close and We Have Higher Expectations</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Dr. Shih Chao-chi, the former ambassador to the United States, has been residing in Shanghai since he left his post. Yesterday (the 19th), he made a statement to reporters, saying, "I am very pleased with the spirit of unity and common hatred of the enemy among our people in the face of the violent Japanese invasion. The editorials in the European and American newspapers in Shanghai have all consistently condemned Japan's aggression and methods of warfare. The friendly nations' public opinion has expressed deep sympathy for us, and I am also greatly moved. As for Japan's violation of all international laws that have been recognized as 'civilized' by countries around the world, such as the slaughter of non-combatants, hospital patients, and Red Cross members, the facts are all there, and there is no need to say more. If such brutal acts by the Japanese are not suppressed by international action, there will be a reaction in the future, or even in the near future. Indeed, this civilized world cannot disregard its obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. They must rise up and stop Japan's aggression, because Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931 has already plunged the world into chaos." Referring to the Shanghai battle situation, Shih said, "Our troops are fighting bravely and their morale is extremely high, because they understand that they are fighting for justice, culture, and the defense of their country, so as to avoid invasion and trampling. Our soldiers and civilians, whether at home or abroad, are determined to continue to resist to the end. In fact, all unprecedented disasters and bloodshed can often be alleviated or avoided through appropriate international action. Whenever I think of this, I remember something that happened in Tianjin decades ago, when the American naval commander Yingjiaoyu helped the British naval commander in his time of need. This happened in 1859. At that time, British fleet commander Admiral Hope was seriously injured, and many of his troops were killed or wounded. Commander Darnell of the American warship Powhatan immediately visited the commander to express his condolences. On the way, several British sailors were sailing in small boats, and when they attempted to rescue British sailors on the beach, they were blocked by the receding tide. When the American commander saw this, he ordered several of his shallow-draft ships to rush to their aid, saying, 'Blood is heavier than water.' At that time, although Commander Darnell's actions technically violated his 'neutral' status, and diplomatic circles considered the matter complicated, this righteous act by the American commander quickly won the sympathy of all parties in the world. The American commander believed that humanitarianism was more important than diplomatic considerations. This wise judgment was considered reasonable by people of all countries. Commander Darnell's words and deeds not only deeply moved the British and Americans at the time, but are still praised to this day. Because of this, the extent to which the countries of the world will turn a blind eye to Japan's aggression is truly cause for doubt. Regarding current Sino-American relations, Shih said that because he is a former ambassador to the United States and has now returned after leaving his post, he does not want to say too much, but he said that the Chinese people have had contact with the United States earlier, so they have higher expectations for the United States than for other countries. This feeling has a historical basis. Even before the United States declared its independence, the two countries had close trade relations. In the early days of Sino-American trade, it was of great benefit to the then fledgling American economy. Later, in the first half of the last century, the development of American shipping and Sino-American trade benefited the development of the United States along the Pacific coast. American missionaries arrived in Guangzhou at about the same time as American merchant ships. American personnel have always been in leading positions in education, hospitals, and charitable undertakings. After the World War, when the Washington Conference was held, the United States resolutely advocated the adoption of new measures in the East. As a result, the Nine-Power Treaty was signed. The signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty almost included all the Pacific countries related to the current Sino-Japanese dispute. Shih concluded that the treaty also contained provisions to deal with the current dispute.</p>
<h3>The Comforting Association Calls on All Sectors Not to Send Comforting Items Directly to the Front</h3>
<p>The Situation of Entering and Exiting Gunfire Is Dangerous; There Are Also Fears That Traitors May Be Mixed In, Resulting in the Leakage of Military Secrets</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that recently, all sectors have been sending comforting items directly to the front, which is certainly commendable, but the situation of entering and exiting gunfire is extremely dangerous, and it is inevitable that villains will be mixed in, resulting in the leakage of military secrets. A certain headquarters yesterday sent a special letter to the Shanghai Municipal Comforting Committee, stating, "The war zone is heavily guarded, and the enemy's bombing is becoming more frequent. There are also fears that traitors may use the pretext of comforting to enter the positions, endangering the entire battle situation. In order to protect the safety of the enthusiastic groups or individuals from all walks of life who love the frontline soldiers, we specially request your committee to immediately notify the public in Shanghai that in the future, all comforting items should be sent to your committee for forwarding, so as to unify and avoid danger." The committee yesterday sent separate letters to relevant groups, advising them not to send items directly to the front, but to hand them over to the Comforting Committee for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Fifteen of Our Merchant Ships Have Been Detained by the Enemy</h3>
<p>Crew Members Are Being Sent Back to the Country in Succession</p>
<p>Continental Daily reports that according to news from the shipping industry and the naval circles in this port, all Chinese ships chartered by Japanese merchants have been detained in Japan. It is said that this move is in retaliation for the Chinese army's sinking of several Japanese Kiyokawa Company ships when it blockaded the river in Shanghai's Nanshi and Zhenjiang. It is estimated that there are a total of fifteen Chinese ships in Japan, and their crew members will be sent back to Hong Kong, Qingdao, and Tianjin in succession.</p>

<h3>Pawnbrokers Association Letter to Fellow Businesses Soliciting Cotton Quilts</h3>
<p>To Transport to the Front Lines for Soldiers' Use</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association has specially issued an official letter to all pawnbrokers yesterday regarding the solicitation of bedding to be transported to the front lines for soldiers' use. The letter reads as follows: "To whom it may concern, we have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which forwarded a letter from the Shanghai Comfort Committee, stating that the secretariat of the All-Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association has approved a letter from He Mingjun of the pawnbroking industry. The letter stated, 'Having recently read reports that cotton quilts are urgently needed at the front lines, according to a military officer, the weather is now cold, especially at night, and cotton quilts are essential for keeping warm. When wounded soldiers are transferred to the rear, the journey takes time, and exposure to wind and cold will make treatment even more difficult. My humble opinion is to collect cotton quilts and entrust them to the Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, the Beishi Pawnbrokers Office, and the Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, to donate expired cotton quilts from various pawnshops to the front lines. Within a few days, two to three thousand cotton quilts can be easily collected. There are six to seven hundred pawnshops in the city, so the burden on each is minimal. We hope that you will quickly send special personnel to contact and solicit donations to meet the urgent needs of the front lines. This would be most fortunate.' This has been approved.</p>
<p>We have noted that the weather has been getting colder recently, and the soldiers at the front and rear undoubtedly need cotton quilts. Therefore, we plan to write to your association, forwarding letters to the Pawnbroking Industry Association and the Beishi Pawnbrokers Office, requesting that you widely collect and donate them voluntarily, delivering them directly to Qianjiang Primary School on Ningbo Road for transfer to the soldiers. We have received this information. We believe that the request in the letter is for maintaining the health of the soldiers and increasing our resistance to the enemy. Moreover, considering the strength of the pawnbroking industry in the city, donating two to three thousand expired cotton quilts will not cost much. We sincerely hope that your association will lead the industry in accomplishing this righteous act. We received this information and approved it.</p>
<p>We believe that this matter concerns relieving the front lines and increasing our resistance to the enemy. Accordingly, we have recorded the case and forwarded it to you. We hope that when you encounter expired cotton quilts, you will donate them as much as possible or first inform our association so that we can determine donation methods to distribute the burden evenly and meet the urgent needs. This letter is addressed to members of a certain pawnshop, Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, issued on September 18th."</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Taiyuan reported on the 17th that on the 15th, the enemy in the area of Diaoquan, Lingqiu, launched five or six fierce attacks on us, but we repulsed the stubborn enemy with a head-on attack. However, taking advantage of the fact that our troops were changing positions and had not yet established contact, the enemy attacking Lingqiu launched a fierce attack on one of our divisions with a large force. The division commander led his troops in a desperate resistance, and the entire division suffered heavy casualties and are now fighting hard. A brigade of our fresh troops has been sent to reinforce them. On the 15th, enemy planes attacked Taiyuan twice from the morning. In the first attack, fourteen enemy planes dropped fifty-three bombs in the factory area north of the city, killing and injuring more than ten people. In the second attack, four enemy planes dropped seventeen bombs in the city, injuring more than ten students and civilians. It is also reported that over a thousand enemies, infantry and cavalry combined, and several hundred enemies at Heishi Ridge, both have the appearance of advancing westward. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Several enemy planes attacked Taiyuan in the morning of the 19th. Our air force immediately took off to intercept them.

One enemy plane was shot down at Dameng Town (fifty miles south of Xin County), and details are being investigated. Another plane fled to the vicinity of Mahui Town in Xin County and encountered our planes returning from assisting in the front lines, and was hit by the incoming planes, exploding, crashing, and burning. The pilots were all killed. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

The enemy vehicles retreated in fear, and a part of our fresh troops bravely attacked the enemy in Li Lou, completely surrounding more than eighty enemy troops. The enemy fled into nearby civilian houses, and our troops are now searching and clearing them. The situation on the front is now improving, and our troops will make great progress in the coming days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Hull's Important Speech on American Peace Movement</h3>
<p>America Adopts a Moderate Approach and Strives for Peace; Better to Not Excel Neighbors in Aircraft and Cannons</p>
<p>[New York] The National Peace Congress opened today. Secretary of State Hull gave a speech, saying, "The consequences of a completely isolationist policy are the same as the negative consequences of intervening in foreign affairs, resulting in wasted effort." The principles upon which international peace should be based have been explained in my written statement issued on July 16. The United States government is committed to peace and spares no effort because peace and the welfare of the people are fundamentally inseparable. "If the nations of the world can cooperate economically, thereby developing trade, then the lives of the people of all countries will be prosperous, and the benefits of peace for all countries will be balanced. This balance is more sustainable than that created by outdoing neighboring countries with cannons and aircraft." (Havas dispatch from New York on the 18th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Advocates Supporting China</h3>
<p>As a Matter of Conscience</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German "Attack" newspaper commented on the Far Eastern situation today, saying, "Regarding China and Japan, we must decide whether to support China or Japan. This is a matter of conscience, both in Europe and especially in Germany. Speaking for Germany, our emotions are balanced. If we allow China to be swallowed by Japan today, the blame borne by the white powers will be significant. For Japan's sake, now that Japan has obtained the entire northern coast of China, it should stop advancing. Otherwise, one day it will encounter not only Chinese resistance but also the resistance of international forces." (Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 18th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Discusses Preventing Trafficking of Women and Children</h3>
<p>Planning to Establish an Office in Shanghai or Singapore to Facilitate Progress</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Social Issues Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly met this month. Chairwoman Countess Albert Apponyi, the Hungarian representative, discussed the issue of selecting one of two locations, Singapore and Shanghai, to establish a League of Nations office to prevent trafficking of women and children. Chinese representative Ms. Yan Yaqian, Danish representative Ms. Fu Xiangmei, British representative Ms. Ward (a member of the House of Commons), and French representative Madame Schryer successively gave speeches, all acknowledging in principle the necessity of establishing a specialized organization in the Far East to prevent trafficking of women and children. However, opinions differed regarding the location. Dutch representative Rutten, citing financial reasons, advocated selecting Singapore. Chinese representative Ms. Yan Yaqian expressed her opposition on behalf of the Chinese delegation, advocating selecting Shanghai, stating that most of those trafficked are Chinese women, and that even from an economic perspective, Shanghai is more suitable. The Chinese government's responsibility to prevent trafficking of women is currently difficult due to the inability to concentrate various intelligence affairs. The establishment of an office by the League of Nations will be extremely beneficial. Furthermore, after the office is established, it is hoped that it will publish publications in Chinese. The committee then resolved to appoint representatives from China, India, Siam, the Commonwealth of Australia, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal to form a subcommittee to study the location issue at a meeting on the 20th of this month.

<h3>Enemy Troops Again Massacre Innocents</h3>
<p>Near Haining Road; Corpses Examined and Buried</p>
<p>Although various groups have appealed to uphold justice regarding the enemy troops' atrocities and indiscriminate killing of our innocent people, these actions cannot be slightly curbed. Yesterday morning, a poor Chinese man, around thirty years old, passing through Dexing Lane at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, was suddenly dragged into the lane by many enemy troops and did not come out for a long time. After the Concession police station received a report, they immediately went to investigate and found that the man had been shot dead. The injuries were on his back. Based on the wounds, they were caused by rifle bullets. The corpse was sent to the morgue, and the inspector of the Special First Court confirmed that the death was caused by gunshot wounds and ordered burial. This is also evidence of the Japanese military's atrocities.</p>
<h3>US Embargo on Munitions: Ambassador Wang Visits President Roosevelt</h3>
<p>After Declaring This Action is Unfavorable to China, He Smiles and Departs; US Authorities Consider Participating in League of Nations Meetings</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull and State Department legal expert Wilson met with President Roosevelt today. According to reliable sources, the meeting concerned whether the United States should participate in the League of Nations' Twenty-Three Nation Committee. Whether the United States and China have received the request from this advisory committee is yet to be announced by US officials. According to White House sources, Chinese Ambassador Dr. Wang Zhengting met with the US President today to discuss that the prohibition of government ships carrying munitions is unfavorable to China. However, reliable sources say that the US authorities may not be able to retract this order. Dr. Wang smiled and departed after a half-hour meeting at the White House, unlike his worried expression when leaving the State Department after meeting with Hull yesterday. (Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to knowledgeable sources, Chinese Ambassador Wang Zhengting's discussion concerned the US government's prohibition of its ships transporting munitions and military supplies to both China and Japan. Ambassador Wang explained the Chinese government's position on this matter. Generally speaking, the Chinese government did not want the US government to view this communication as a protest, but the consequences of this embargo, which are unfavorable to China, have greatly disappointed China and they hope the US will understand. Furthermore, Secretary of State Hull also called on President Roosevelt today, and it is said that the discussion also concerned the Far Eastern situation. (Havas dispatch from Washington on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the League of Nations Council decided to refer the dispute between China and Japan to the Twenty-Three Nation Advisory Committee, the committee has scheduled its first meeting on the 21st of this month to discuss two matters: ① Inviting representatives from both parties, i.e., China and Japan, to attend and express their opinions; ② Whether Germany should be invited to attend, given that after the committee was established in February 1933, Germany announced its withdrawal from the League in October of that year. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that after the United States joined the committee in 1933, it set a precedent for non-member states of the League of Nations to participate in the committee. Whether the current US government will continue to participate is still under negotiation between the League of Nations and the Washington government, and the United States has not yet made a decision. The Chinese delegation firmly believes that the United States will at least send observers to attend the meeting. (Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Sins of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Lin Gengbai</p>
<p>Recently, patriots have often thought that the conflict between China and Japan is actually due to the Japanese militarists coercing their government, including its senior statesmen, ministers, and even its political parties, and is a reckless and destructive act that is not the original intention of the senior statesmen, ministers, nor is it what the political parties and people want to hear. This is a big mistake. Japan, given the existence of its traditional feudal group consciousness and the fact that economic development cannot but seek a larger colony as its outlet, both of these compel it to annex China. This cannot be compared to the losses of European and American capitalist countries in the European war and the difficulty of governing colonies. Okuma Shigenobu once jokingly said to Ito Hirobumi, the Resident-General of Korea, "I will be the Resident-General of China." Anyone who knows a little about Japan can say this. Moreover, their nation's shared narrow patriotism, fostered and promoted by a penchant for aggrandizement, interacts and collides with their political and economic stances, finally leading to a decisive break. Therefore, unless the organization of Japanese imperialism changes, Japan will inevitably not abandon its attempt to annex China. This is both inevitable and a foregone conclusion. To still hope for a Sino-Japanese compromise in this situation is no different from discussing the Classic of Filial Piety to ward off the Yellow Turbans; it is the height of foolishness. I firmly believe that before a revolution in Japanese society is realized, the structure of Japanese imperialism will remain strong. If there is no significant and drastic change in its politics, like the German revolution of 1919 where the monarchy was overthrown with the war, there is no room for cooperation between China and Japan. Why? Because the international environment and Japan's own politics and economy have long determined the direction of Japanese imperialists. Even if the arrogance of the military is slightly reduced, it will not change Japan's attitude towards China. Since we advocate thorough resistance, we hope that people throughout the country share this understanding, and from this understanding, they will promote and advocate it, so that the last drop of blood of the Chinese nation will not be sacrificed lightly. I will offer incense to seek this.</p>
<p>Since Tianjin and Beiping have become the de facto military bases of Japanese imperialists, the atmosphere of resistance has risen with the enemy's flames. Under the leadership of the central government and the supreme leader, we have long believed that peace between China and Japan has entered its final stage. After the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, this final stage has reached its end. Originally, the so-called peace between China and Japan in recent years was only a one-sided fantasy and a combination of the other side taking advantage of the opportunity. Therefore, although the integrity of Chinese territory and sovereignty can be seen in the text, this beautiful text has also been shattered by the artillery fire of Japanese imperialists. On the Chinese side, based on the greatest tolerance, it initially focused on negotiation and prepared for war as a secondary measure, and then focused on preparing for war and used negotiation as a secondary measure, never ceasing to pursue negotiations, with the intention of not only maintaining peace between China and Japan, but also laying the foundation for peace in East Asia and even world peace. Unfortunately, it initially incited Japan's contempt and intensified aggression, and then invited Japan's suspicion and exploitation, leading to preemptive actions. Their plan for a full-scale war against China within the year seems to be unfolding before our eyes, but my observation is that the cracks in the outwardly strong but inwardly weak Japanese imperialists have been exposed in the war in Shanghai. Precisely because of this, we should thoroughly resist with the ultimate determination and effort, and declare a severance of diplomatic relations. Then, the most favorable future will definitely be in China, not Japan. Everyone knows that the Japanese imperialists' seizure of Tianjin and Beiping was to occupy Chahar and Suiyuan, gradually threatening Hebei and Shanxi, and then invading Mongolia, and further attacking the Soviet Union. But we must also know that even if the Japanese imperialists' intentions for Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi are all realized, they still cannot grasp the entirety of China, which will affect their invasion of Mongolia and their attack on the Soviet Union. Therefore, before the Japanese imperialists dominate the entire China, they dare not easily launch military operations against Mongolia and the Soviet Union, because China can give them significant blows at any time. From this point of view, we can clearly see that the Japanese imperialists must place the Chinese government under their control. In other words, they must at least have a grip on controlling the Chinese government, and they must completely control it in order to invade Mongolia and attack the Soviet Union with all their strength. The anti-communist agreement with China that they shout every day is only a means for Japanese imperialists to temporarily stabilize Sino-Japanese relations. When they have victory, China's destiny will go without saying.</p>
<p>Knowing this even more, Japan's undeclared war, with diplomacy as a buffer, is not only deception, not only a smokescreen released by the Japanese government, but can simply be said to be that the Japanese imperialists have never been able to cover up their own weakness. Just look at recent. The full-scale war has already begun, but the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is severing diplomatic relations without admitting it. Everyone must not ignore that these tenuous diplomatic ties are the weakness of Japanese imperialists, the poison given to China, and the hidden reefs for the liberation of the Chinese nation. We must never, in times of victory or even defeat in regional battles, adopt diplomatic methods and give them more opportunities to prepare. On the other hand, our battles, whether victorious, defeated, or stalemated, must recognize that diplomatic negotiations are most likely to demoralize our troops and encourage the enemy's arrogance. The lessons of the four northeastern provinces and Tianjin are already telling us this.</p>
<p>What I am concerned about here is not the complete military defeat of China, but the local victories or defeats, or the stalemate, because if the result of defeat is to negotiate for peace, then the alliance under the city walls is equivalent to national subjugation. China would make a final struggle, but China were to be faced with local victories or a stalemate, third countries would inevitably come out again for further mediation, especially in the case of local victories, such as the elimination of the Japanese troops landing in Shanghai, would involve further mediation, which would somewhat have the meaning of easing the situation for Japan and embellishing the image of China. As for whether Japan can accept it, that is another question, and then the indecision of a forked road is again in front of China.</p>
<p>Also, as everyone knows, the Japanese imperialists cannot sustain a prolonged war against China, but in addition to the political internal crisis and economic impossibility that everyone recognizes, concern for the Soviet Union is the biggest reason. We can affirm that Japan's emphasis on China and the Soviet Union is mutually causal. When China has not been completely dominated, Japan certainly does not dare to attack the Soviet Union, but if it relaxes on the Soviet Union and uses all its military force to invade China first, allowing the Soviet Union to become stronger, and if the war is prolonged, the Soviet Union's national power will become stronger day by day. These worries behind them are equal to a mantis stalking a cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Japanese imperialists would never be so unwise. Therefore, Japan's policy towards China can only be to advance step by step. If China can truly thoroughly resist, the collapse of Japanese imperialist forces can be awaited.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the midst of the Soviet Union's purge of its military and China's preparations for war, Japan's rapid and large-scale invasion of China seems to be a show of strength, but it is actually a demonstration of weakness. Because of this, the Japanese imperialists' inability to sustain a prolonged war against China is becoming increasingly evident. I believe that after a considerable period of thorough resistance, the Soviet Union will naturally join the united front, because if China wins, the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops will certainly reap the benefits of a fisherman, and if China loses, for the sake of lips and teeth being interdependent, the Soviet Union cannot but rise up to back China, that is, for self-defense, otherwise the Soviet Union, besieged by Japan and Germany, would have no chance of survival. At the same time, I believe that if China can use the stalemate of the war to urgently conclude a military agreement with the Soviet Union in the Far East, it will be especially beneficial to both.</p>
<p>Some people think that once the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex of the Sino-Japanese war, it will inevitably cause suspicion from Britain and the United States, and jealousy from Germany and Italy. I feel that this only sees half of the picture, because Britain and the United States only want to maintain their market position in China and have no other intentions, and Germany and Italy have no direct interests in the Far East. The inability of Britain and the United States to help China and oppose Japan also determines that they cannot help Japan and exclude China. As for Germany and Italy, since they have no so-called interests in China, they will naturally only stand on the sidelines, which is obvious. If it is said that Britain and Germany do not want to weaken Japan's power, and even more so for the sake of the brewing of the Anglo-Japanese alliance and the establishment of the German-Japanese agreement, Britain and Germany will step forward one day, then we must also know that the contradictions between European countries and the contradictions between European and American countries are complicated and constantly changing. If it is not a conflict with their own direct interests, and if they cannot avoid resorting to force, any country is worried about affecting the whole body with one hair. In the mutual restraint, no one is willing to easily step out of their own military walls and challenge a country equal to their own national power. This is also an ironclad fact. Moreover, the United States' open door policy in the Far East and Britain's traditional foreign policy are both based on avoiding force. Although Germany and Italy are greatly watching for opportunities, especially Germany's coveting of a part of the Soviet Union's territory, they are ultimately prevented by these contradictions and will never be as reckless and destructive as Japan. Therefore, even if Britain and Germany want to favor Japan, it will at least be when the power of the Japanese imperialists is reduced to a certain limit. If during this period, China has not yet actually united with the Soviet Union in a military alliance, then their favoring of Japan will be limited to neutrality, and even if they favor Japan and resort to force, it will only be Germany, but it also depends on how the diplomacy of China and the Soviet Union is being used at that time.</p>

<h3>How to Comfort the Loyal and Brave Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the enemy re-enacted the 'January 28th' incident in Shanghai, the enemy originally hoped to "sweep away our troops within a week." However, for six weeks, our loyal and brave soldiers have resisted valiantly, and although they have not been driven out of the Jiangwan coast, they have repeatedly blunted the enemy's attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. It is no wonder that the British "have increased their respect for the martial valor of Chinese soldiers." However, this is only the beginning of a major war. The great achievements of our soldiers will surely be earth-shattering throughout history and praised by the world without decline. In the future, the country will have a constant code for revering virtue and rewarding merit, and it is not necessary for us to chatter about it. However, we, acting in accordance with our conscience, cannot help but speak out. Just think, on the battlefield, cannons are exploding in front and planes are towering above. All the merciless bullets that graze the face and ears are more than enough to cause death. And yet, they nestle in that environment, calmly responding to the battle. They charge forward, fighting bravely to kill the enemy, bandaging their wounds without knowing that the scars are still fresh. Even when dying, they still shout to kill the enemy, their spirit shaking the mountains and moving the ghosts and gods to tears. The enemy is fighting for aggression and slaughter, driven to death by their militarists. Our soldiers, who resist the aggression of a strong enemy, do not hesitate to face the bayonets and leave themselves exposed to bullets because of the survival of our masses, not wanting to see a continuation of the Korean experience. Now that our soldiers are fighting for our masses, their deaths and injuries are naturally deaths and injuries for our masses. How should we express our reverence for the meritorious soldiers and how should we do our utmost to care for the dead and wounded soldiers? This is what we should be mindful of at all times.</p>
<p>The reward of meritorious soldiers and the preferential treatment of the dead and wounded soldiers, the central government has its own methods. But the code of reward, in addition to promotion, awards, honorary grants, and preferential treatment, should also provide special treatment for their descendants in this era, even though there is no example of hereditary military merit. We should also imitate the stories of Lingyan Pavilion and Ziguang Pavilion, so that admiration is recorded for eternity. In addition to providing generous care and raising orphans for the fallen soldiers, we should also appropriately exempt them from taxes and educate their children. We should also build ancestral shrines to honor the loyal martyrs at the places where they died in order to inspire future generations with enthusiasm for loyalty and bravery. As for the wounded soldiers, the most important thing is to have appropriate treatment. From various reports, we know that the difficulties encountered by soldiers at the front after being injured are unspeakable. The enemy disregards humanity, disregards public law, and arbitrarily bombs ambulances, so that the wounded soldiers at the front cannot be transported out except at night. And night transportation is difficult, and the delivery cannot be done quickly. It is said that the front line should be equipped with considerable nursing equipment. And the military hospitals in the rear, since they serve the wounded, should especially treat them with deep sympathy everywhere. Their wounds are not for private matters, but for public battles. They are not for themselves, but for us. Whether they are moaning and groaning or in a state of agitation, we must know that these are the normal states of the sick. Even if they are incurable, we must make them forget the source of their pain before they pass away. This is what doctors and nurses with compassionate hearts must strive to control their emotions for, to frequently treat them, and to repeatedly comfort them, so that the injured do not feel the pain.</p>
<p>As for what the public should do, in addition to working hard to provide relief to the soldiers at the front, all efforts should be made to expand rescue equipment, raise consolation money for the descendants of the fallen soldiers, establish education funds, plan for job introductions, and care for the disabled soldiers and provide them with relief. I know that all those who have a concept of the country and the nation should deeply understand this meaning.</p>

Two French cruisers and six destroyers passed through the Strait of Gibraltar from the Atlantic this afternoon and entered the Mediterranean to implement the surveillance measures stipulated in the Nyon Agreement to prevent piracy. In addition, British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Hotham has arrived here aboard his flagship HMS Barham from Malta. Twenty more British warships will arrive in port tomorrow and enter the Mediterranean to implement the surveillance measures. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Mediterranean surveillance measures, British officials have stated that the number of British and French destroyers in the Mediterranean is greater than the number used to prevent submarine attacks during the European War. Their power is extremely strong and sufficient to effectively enhance the position of Britain and France. Any attempts to blockade the Spanish Republican government through piracy will be impossible. In the future, any ships sailing to ports under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government, unless they are smuggling arms, will be facilitated by the British and French fleets. Although Britain and France have now withdrawn the surveillance work on the Spanish coast regarding the non-intervention policy, they will not change their non-intervention policy. The director of the surveillance measures relief headquarters, Dutchman Van Ham, is planning to submit a plan to the Adjustment Committee, which includes eight points:</p>
<p>㊀ The surveillance measures for all Spanish ports are ineffective and should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>㊁ The activities of ships in the ports of all relevant countries, whether or not they are sailing to Spain, should be reported to the Adjustment Committee by the governments of those countries.</p>
<p>㊂ Inspectors should be dispatched to board and monitor all ships of relevant countries leaving European ports, regardless of whether or not they are sailing to Spain.</p>
<p>㊃ The inspectors should report the number of foreign ships anchored in ports along the way to the Adjustment Committee.</p>
<p>㊄ The governments of relevant countries should report the number of Spanish ships in their ports to the Adjustment Committee.</p>
<p>㊅ For ships of neutral countries sailing to Spain, the Adjustment Committee should liaise with the governments of those countries to verify their activities.</p>
<p>㊆ Any aircraft flying over the Pyrenees Mountains on the border between France and Spain should be closely monitored.</p>
<p>㊇ The land border surveillance measures in Spain should be maintained.</p>
<p>France and Sweden have already accepted the above plan, and Britain will also express its approval. In short, Britain and France are now determined to maintain the non-intervention policy and will strengthen it, unless there is definite large-scale assistance to the Spanish Nationalist forces, in which case it will be considered separately. However, there is currently no indication of this. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Britain will soon establish its second air force base in the Mediterranean in Gibraltar (Malta is currently Britain's only air force port in the Mediterranean). All residents and shops in the western district of the port have been ordered to vacate within three months to build the air force port. (19th, National Maritime News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙ Naples. The Italian army 'Sartrada Division', stationed in the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, with 231 officers and 2,791 soldiers, boarded the 'Liguria' postal ship tonight and headed to Libya for defense. In addition, the 20th Battalion and 22nd Battalion of special infantry also sailed to East Africa tonight aboard the 'Victoria' postal ship. It is unknown where the 23rd Battalion will depart on the 'Sicilia' ship. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Rome] The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, England, and the French Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Balon Perrier, visited Foreign Minister Ciano together this morning. It is reported that the two Chargés d'Affaires yesterday sent Ciano a full copy of the appendix to the Nyon Agreement. Today's visit may be related to this matter. The Roman People's Daily reported that the British and French Chargés d'Affaires explained to the Foreign Minister that if Italy raises any concrete opinions on the text of the Nyon Agreement or its appendices, all signatory countries are willing to accept or consider them with enthusiasm. In addition, Italian newspapers published news from correspondents in London and Paris, stating that the Nyon Conference and the debates at the League of Nations will not deprive the Adjustment Committee of the London Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Measures of its powers, which would benefit the League of Nations, or in other words, benefit organizations that Italy does not welcome. This kind of overstepping is unlikely to facilitate the rapprochement between the positions of Britain and France and the position of Italy. However, the attitude of the Italian newspapers towards the current situation is extremely calm. (China Fire News Agency, 19th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] After the establishment of the Nyon Agreement, the stalemate between Britain and France and Italy and Germany seems to be irreparable today. An Italian newspaper said that the cooperation between Britain and France in the Mediterranean is the 'most convenient exercise for future wars'. However, it is widely rumored in Berlin that German leader Hitler is unwilling to support Italy's tough stance on the situation in the Mediterranean. Well-informed observers do not believe that Italy and Germany have forgotten that the combined naval strength of Britain and France far exceeds that of Italy and Germany, and that the number of French troops is also beyond Germany's reach. (19th, National Electric)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian newspapers commented on the Nyon Agreement, pointing out that it was a conspiracy by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to harm Italy. The Italian Forum newspaper stated that it is now clear that Britain and France are currently taking dangerous actions according to a predetermined plan, purely for their own interests. The ultimate goal of their predetermined plan is still unclear. It is time for us to stop the intolerable tyranny. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Air Defense Exercises in the Berlin Area</h3>
<p>Large scale and long duration</p>
<p>[Berlin] The government has decided to hold large-scale air defense exercises in Berlin and the northern provinces in the middle of next week. It is expected to last for a week. The scale and duration are unprecedented. The results of this exercise will be applied when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini comes to Germany to review the German army, navy, and air force later this month. During the exercise, each city and village in the northern region will have commissioners in charge of air defense matters. Once the alarm is issued, residents must strictly follow the commissioners' orders and evacuate to designated locations for shelter. Without permission, they are not allowed to go outside. In Berlin, all lights must be completely turned off every night during the exercise. Residents in the most threatened areas must evacuate to cellars. Gas masks have also been distributed throughout the city for emergency use. According to the scheduled procedure, at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month, a large number of aircraft will fly from the east to the sky above Berlin to drop bombs. The bombs used are specially for exercise purposes and will produce loud noises and thick smoke when they land. At the same time, real bombs and incendiary bombs will be used to bomb designated areas along Wilhelmstrasse, where most of the old houses were originally scheduled to be demolished and all residents were relocated months ago. This time, they will be used as bombing targets so that the city's fire brigade and police can go to put out the fire for practice. In addition, gas bombs will be dropped in many places in the city to test the nature and effectiveness of various gases. At the same time, the effectiveness of smoke bombs will also be tested. Berlin Police Chief Count Heldolf has issued a notice ordering all residents of the city to abide by the prohibitions and remain calm and maintain normalcy during the exercise.

<h3>League of Nations Cautious on the Spanish Issue</h3>
<p>Will not impose sanctions on Germany and Italy</p>
<p>[Geneva] Spanish Prime Minister Negrín yesterday requested at the League of Nations General Assembly that the League recognize Spain as a victim of Italian and German aggression and restore the Spanish government's right to purchase war equipment. However, according to general opinion, the League of Nations cannot discuss the issue of Italian and German aggression, because if this matter is dealt with, Article 16 of the Covenant will apply, and most member states are unwilling to be forced to take sanctions. Therefore, this issue may be discussed slightly by the Sixth Committee, but there will be no concrete measures other than empty resolutions. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] French Foreign Minister Delbos met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck this afternoon to discuss bilateral relations.

<h3>Roosevelt to Tour the West</h3>
<p>Fighting with the Supreme Court</p>
<p>[Washington] After President Roosevelt delivered an important speech the day before yesterday, he is scheduled to tour the northwestern states of the United States within days. According to the general impression, President Roosevelt intends to continue to fight firmly with the Supreme Court, which can now be confirmed by this matter. The speech delivered by President Kwai clearly affirmed that he would continue to make great efforts to restore the stability of executive and judicial power. Although the President recently suffered a defeat in the Senate, the Supreme Court Justice Black, whom he recently appointed, is rumored to be a member of the KKK, which has caused a lot of criticism. However, the President's determination to stabilize the executive and legislative powers will not change because of this, because in the President's opinion, this stability has been undermined by a few oligarchs who want to turn the Supreme Court into a fortress for a few people to protect the interests of a few people. The President also mentioned that he would defeat the resistance of the Supreme Court, only stating that the reform of the Supreme Court should be carried out within the scope of the Constitution, because the Constitution has no clear regulations on the number of Supreme Court Justices. The speech delivered by President Kwai this time is similar in nature to a campaign speech, and its purpose is to promote his so-called Second New Deal. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After US President Roosevelt delivered a broad speech yesterday criticizing dictatorship, German Nazi Party figures have vehemently criticized it. The party's organ, the People's Observer, stated that the situation of divergent opinions among countries around the world was already quite serious. President Roosevelt has now issued words hostile to dictatorship in a demagogic manner, and his intention is nothing more than to make the divergent state even more serious. Moreover, there are many questionable points in Roosevelt's domestic policy. Roosevelt himself also harbors dictatorial ambitions. His criticism of foreign dictatorships is intended to divert the attention of the American people in order to cover up his ambitions. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>US to Maintain the French Franc Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Washington] The exchange rate of the French franc has recently fallen sharply. Financial figures here are not worried about the position of the French franc, but believe that the US Exchange Equalization Fund may purchase French francs to maintain its exchange rate, which is not impossible. It is also said that French Finance Minister Tingley has not adopted various measures to deal with financial difficulties, which is insufficient. As for the reasons for the recent repeated depreciation of the French franc, there are only two: ㊀ The financial difficulties of France, which were generally thought to be coming to an end, have not yet been resolved. ㊁ The various social measures implemented by the government in the past are the same as the US New Deal and must be given time to take effect.

<h3>Dr. Gong Sude's Faithful Advice to the Japanese People (Continued)</h3>
<p>Now, your country has strayed into a lost path, not seeking the welfare of both countries with China in a spirit of friendship and cooperation. If your country can implement a friendly policy towards China, then what Japan wants to obtain from China will be obtained without asking. If China and Japan are friendly to each other, supply each other, and seek the prosperity of both countries based on the principle of cooperation, then Japanese universities will be full of Chinese students, and Japanese factories will obtain raw materials from China and Asia for manufacturing. Now your country does not plan this, but willingly follows a dark path, exhausting its military power to achieve its goals. From now on, the war will be prolonged, whether it is overt or covert, I am afraid it will take years.</p>
<p>I fear that your country will stray into a wrong path and cause disaster, and the attitude of the East towards Japan has changed. In the past, Asian nations mostly admired Japan's progress and admired it as a leader, thinking that Asian rights and interests could be guaranteed by your country and not be infringed by the West. Unexpectedly, your country has instead been蚕食 of the Asian continent to achieve its wild ambitions of鲸吞, causing Asian nations to feel frightened, and Japan has lost its position as an ally. Japan had already occupied this position, but lost it again because of its分割 of China. If it were not for the reckless use of force by Japan's military authorities, China would have already been inclined and expressed sympathy, and the rest of the Asian countries would have taken the same attitude as China. It must be known that Japan's vitality depends on commerce, but those who hate Japan will never be able to trade with Japan, so Japan's actions are tantamount to severing its own vitality.</p>
<p>If it is said that Japan's current actions are nothing more than following in the footsteps of Europe, it must be known that in the competition between two strong countries, none can自山. However, what the East hopes for is freedom. Now that Japan uses force against people, will it not follow in the footsteps of Europe? The Lord I have always revered said, "All who take the sword will perish by the sword." Is the current situation in Europe not an interpretation of this saying? In the past few decades, Europe used force against the world, but now it is killing each other to the point of滅亡. The way of heaven is good for还, which is clear and not bad. God is eternal, without distinction between East and West, and all are judged. If your country still refuses to repent, I am afraid it will perish and not escape God's condemnation. Indeed, the retribution of the great way is clear. Your country is sowing the seeds of military injustice today. Even if you do not immediately reap its evil results today and tomorrow, God is always there, and justice always exists, and you will eventually receive evil retribution.</p>
<p>I am honest and not good at words. I know that faithful words are offensive to the ear, but the pain in my heart is really great, because what I hope for is another Japan, coming out as a leader. If it is Japan under the power of the military today, it is very different from this, and it is not what I hope for. Moreover, I come from China and see its innocent farmers,颠沛流离. Once I see Japanese planes肆虐, I cannot help but tremble and lose color,仰天待毙. This kind of ignorant common people, even your Japanese people, have nothing to do with them. Now they are suffering this disaster. This kind of military action is truly unnecessary and unforgivable.</p>
<p>I hope that your country will repent and not blindly believe the false propaganda of militarists, but listen to the clear vision of general steady politicians, and quickly seek to restore friendship with China. Those who are strong in迷途 are brave to admit their mistakes, but the cowardly are not. Even if they know their mistakes in their hearts, they still refuse to repent and自文其其. I hope that your country can be as brave as the strong to admit its mistakes and痛改前非, so as to 收拾人心 and restore its position as the leader of peace on that day. If it is said that this is too late, I do not believe it. I have recently met with the Chinese authorities, and many said that if Japan really has good intentions and gives China a臂助, it should be respectfully welcomed. If it still maintains its old state and包存祸心, it is prepared to resist to the death. Moreover, world opinion has mostly sympathized with China. This is what I can see, so I dare to speak frankly and tell you.</p>
<p>If it is said that my words are nothing more than one-sided arguments, I do not want to make any speeches, but I feel pain in my heart and cannot help but cry out. Moreover, my words are no more激 than my direct and earnest advice to the Chinese leaders, and I consider my wording to be no more激. Moreover, I have given lectures to my people, and all the crimes of my nation have been指斥不赦. This is something that everyone knows.</p>
<p>It must be known that we all have deep regrets, including the author and others. However, what I want to say is that the international crime committed in the world today is Japan's invasion of China. This kind of action is a crime against China, destroys international peace, damages its own interests, and eliminates Japan's inherent contribution to the world. I hope that your country will reflect on itself and become the Japan that we hoped for before it entered迷途, so that we can follow it and enjoy its benefits. However, unless your country's mistakes towards China change one day, it will be difficult to receive its benefits in terms of culture, morality, and spirit. I am afraid that it will be the same in economic terms. Because I have a friendship with the people of your country, I dare to express my sincere advice. I am heartbroken and hope you will察鉴.

<h3>The Board of Works, etc. Expresses Disapproval to the Japanese Side for Detaining Grain</h3>
<p>It is unreasonable to push each other off responsibility. If it is not resolved immediately, the responsibility lies with you.</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the troops of various countries stationed in Shanghai have refrigerated rooms and warehouses in Hongkou, in which various grains are stored, some of which are urgently needed by refugees, and some of which are stored by foreign troops. The Japanese authorities now do not allow them to be transported out uniformly. If this matter is not agreed upon at the beginning of this week, the parties concerned will jointly publish an article to correct its wrong. According to an official of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, the Japanese officials have no reason to push each other off responsibility, because the Japanese army said that this matter should be the responsibility of the Japanese navy, and when asked about the Japanese navy, they pushed the responsibility to the Japanese consulate, and the Japanese consulate borrowed the Japanese army or navy to shirk responsibility. In short, the Japanese authorities are determined to prevent this grain from being transported out. Many people believe that the north of Suzhou River is now relatively quiet, and the Japanese authorities have no right to prevent foreigners from going to transport out their own urgently needed items. The Japanese officials even refused to transport out the medicines urgently needed by the refugees from the area. If this matter is not agreed upon in the next forty-eight hours, the parties will publish an article and effectively attribute the responsibility for making the Shanghai refugees unable to get food to the Japanese officials. Yesterday, senior foreigners in this port were all indignant at the actions of the Japanese officials. It is heard that foreign visitors will also take a unified and firm action against this action. Non-official circles now believe that the Japanese officials are deeply afraid that the grain transported out will fall into the hands of the Chinese army. All circles of foreigners ridiculed this statement, saying that the various items transported out of the Hongkou area are urgently needed by civilians and will be used immediately. Even if there is any surplus, it will be stored for future lack. However, according to an official of the Food Committee of the Public Works Bureau, although the grain in the warehouses in the Hongkou area is difficult to transport out due to the difficulties of the Japanese officials, there is no need to worry about the lack of grain in the Concession immediately. As for the reason why they want to transport the grain stored in the north of Suzhou River, it is to avoid the rise in prices in the Concession. For example, refrigerated fish is one of the main meals of the Chinese, and it is now very needed to meet the market. As for rice, there will be no shortage for a while, and vegetables can also be transported in from outside the Concession without any difficulty.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Urgent Appeal for Donations to All Refugee Camps; Repatriation of Refugees Continues</p>
<p>As the weather turns cooler, refugees in various camps lack clothing and food, urgently awaiting donations of funds or old clothes from all sectors to meet their needs. The relief association held a fundraising broadcast yesterday. The repatriation of refugees to their hometowns continues, but due to transportation issues, some routes have been changed. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Relief Committee</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the Municipal Relief Committee's work on September 18: ㊀ General Affairs Group: Received donations of $5,220.80, bringing the total received to $131,722.23 in national currency, and $1,440 in government bonds (face value). ㊁ Shelter Group: Newly admitted 80 refugees, repatriated 201, voluntarily left 344, and 300 were transferred to the Taijiabao Refugee Camp for self-support. The current number of refugees in residence is 21,091 in 61 camps supported by the committee. ㊂ Repatriation Group: Repatriated 1,030 refugees on behalf of various hometown associations, traveling to Suzhou on the Xin Yingzhou. ㊃ Food Supply Group: Provided food for 22,166 refugees. ㊄ Medical Group: Treated 1,580 refugees with minor illnesses, 377 with serious illnesses, and sent four to relief hospitals. ㊅ Guidance Group: Conducted skills registration for 225 refugees and issued the "Implementation Measures for Refugee Children's Education," with instructors in each camp borrowing blackboards and textbooks to start classes.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Fundraising Broadcast</p>
<p>The Municipal Relief Association yesterday invited famous local celebrities, opera enthusiasts, and Dr. Mei Lanfang, in consultation with the Radio Industry Association, to broadcast special and exciting programs all day on the Sino-Western Radio Station, and simulcast on all Shanghai radio stations, to raise funds for refugee relief. It is reported that at 10:00 AM yesterday, the chairman of the association, Pan Gongzhan (represented by the association secretary, Lei Kenan), visited the Sino-Western Radio Station to deliver a speech, reporting on the association's work and explaining the significance and purpose of raising relief donations. The broadcast then commenced according to the scheduled program, with generous donations pouring in from all sides. The association had a tightly organized system for receiving donations, with 13 staff members, in addition to internal staff, divided into eight cars provided by Xiang Sheng, carrying official receipts and promptly proceeding to the addresses indicated by telephone to collect donations. By noon, the amount received was considerable. The association will wait until all donations have been collected before publishing the details in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Only Over 30,000 Received; Continued Appeals for Donations</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Comfort Committee, its work has been extremely intense. It has been striving to solicit and supply the front-line soldiers with necessities such as cotton vests, biscuits, straw sandals, military blankets, cotton quilts, and motorized bicycles. However, it is difficult to collect large quantities of supplies immediately. Therefore, the Anti-Enemy Support Conference resolved that, apart from the Shanghai Comfort Committee, no other organization is allowed to solicit comfort funds. However, those commissioned by the Comfort Committee may issue receipts on its behalf for collection and fundraising, with well-defined regulations. In the ten days since its implementation, the results have been impressive, with a total of over 4,900 yuan collected. The names of the collecting agencies and donors will be announced soon to ensure transparency. It is also reported that the number of silk cotton vests collected by the committee has reached over 30,000 as of yesterday. The goal is to collect 200,000 vests within ten days, and we hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Cruelly Inflict Starvation on Chinese in the Eastern District</h3>
<p>No Way to Escape Due to Lack of Food; Corpses Litter the Roadside</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that there are still Chinese people in Hongkou and the Eastern District who are unwilling to abandon their homes and relocate. Their lives are very precarious, and the main problem is food. Some Chinese initially stored rice bags in their homes to protect against shells and bombs. However, as their food supplies dwindled, they had to rely on these "protective objects." In the past two days, families have been found starving to death on Jiaxing Road and other "no man's lands." They ran out of food and dared not venture out to escape. The corpses of men, women, and children who had starved to death can be found on Caishi Road, Yuanfang Road, and Yuanchang Road. It is truly tragic. Yesterday, someone found two small black dogs in a house in Hongkou that had been without food for at least two weeks. They were given food, and it is likely that they will be taken in. Yesterday, foreigners transporting food north of Suzhou Creek still saw some Chinese people in the Eastern District, who did not stay indoors during the day but sat in the alleys and on the roadside. Some were forced to work in areas managed by the Japanese. The northern part of the Eastern District is still burning corpses.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Municipal Relief Committee in Relieving Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, various charitable organizations in the city have risen up to form relief agencies. Subsequently, as the situation in Shanghai became increasingly tense, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to centralize relief efforts and unify administrative structures, united relevant agencies and organizations to form the Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee, with Director Pan serving as Chairman and eleven leaders from the charitable sector serving as Standing Committee members. Initially, the office was temporarily located in Renji Hall, and later moved to the Pudong Building. The work has been extremely intense over the past month. The situation since the establishment of the committee is described below:</p>
<p>Founding Organizations</p>
<p>The committee is jointly organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Disaster Relief Association, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the World Red Swastika Society, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Disaster Relief Federation, the Chinese Catholic Action Society, the Shanghai YMCA, medical organizations in the city, and various Shanghai hometown associations. Its sole purpose is to provide charitable relief in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>The internal organization of the committee is divided into a secretariat and general affairs, foreign affairs, finance, shelter, catering, repatriation, medical, guidance, security, and burial groups. The secretariat has one chief secretary, two secretaries, and several staff members. Each group has one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and several committee members. There are also several supervisory committee members responsible for supervising the progress of the committee's affairs.</p>
<p>Shelter and Relief</p>
<p>Shortly after the committee was established, the Shanghai war broke out, and residents from the war zone fled to the concessions to seek refuge. The committee immediately sent personnel to negotiate for refugee shelters and to dispatch ambulances. Subsequently, as the war zone expanded and the number of refugees continued to increase, the original shelters could hardly accommodate them. Director Pan first ordered all schools to be used for shelter as a priority, and then contacted various entertainment venues to borrow them for sheltering refugees. At that time, schools were not in session during the summer vacation, and entertainment venues were also shut down due to the situation, so using these venues could accommodate a large number of refugees.</p>
<p>Shelter Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai war broke out on August 13, but on August 12, countless people had already been trampled by the enemy and fled. Therefore, on that day, the committee established five shelters, accommodating more than 500 refugees. Subsequently, as the war expanded and the number of refugees increased, the committee tried its best to increase the number of shelters and urged other organizations, institutions, or individuals to assist in establishing shelters. According to the committee's latest survey, there are 59 shelters established by the committee that also provide their own food, 12 shelters managed by other organizations with food provided by the committee, and 39 shelters managed by other organizations that also provide food. There are also more than 30 shelters that have been discontinued due to poor management or are still in preparation. Therefore, at most, there were over 140 shelters, accommodating approximately over 40,000 refugees. The shelters were distributed in temples, entertainment venues, schools, empty houses, and other public places. Transportation was arranged. Since the opening of the shelters, the number of refugees has increased, and there is a shortage of space. Moreover, the concessions are sometimes affected by stray bullets, so it is necessary to arrange repatriation. The committee contacted the Maritime Affairs Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the two Road Management Bureaus to designate special vehicles and ships for repatriation by both land and water routes. However, because the railway line was bombed by enemy aircraft from time to time, causing obstacles to the line, trains could not operate, so transportation relied only on automobiles and ships. Most of the repatriated refugees went to Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places. The number of refugees transported each day varied from several thousand to several hundred.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Plans to Establish Shelters in the Chinese Area</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, refugees from the war zone have fled to the concessions and poured into various shelters. However, there are still many who have not escaped from the war zone, and some who attempt to enter the concessions are prevented from doing so, leading to a very tragic situation. Now that it is autumn, the nights are exceptionally cold. Therefore, the International Relief Committee plans to use schools in the Chinese area as shelters. Mr. Orr, a standing committee member of the Committee, is responsible for contacting the Japanese side, and Qu Wenliu is responsible for contacting various schools.</p>
<h3>"I Have Already Dedicated Myself to the Nation and the People"</h3>
<p>— Lu Wenting</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the newspaper published a letter from Toshiko, the wife of enemy pilot Uta Magonosuke, which contained the sentence, "I hope you have the spirit of Sergeant Kurosaki, who escaped death." In contrast, in the wounded soldier hospital founded by the Yousheng Travel Group, there is our brave soldier Jiang Junde, who has dedicated himself to the country and asked his fiancée to marry someone else. This is a powerful guarantee that "the final victory belongs to us."</p>
<p>Ms. Lu Wenting is the founder of Youde Primary School. Now, this school may have been destroyed by gunfire. She volunteered to join the hospital as a nurse. This article was written by her. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>Walking on muddy roads, I arrived at the wounded soldier hospital on time. Nursing the wounded soldiers is a pleasant task for me. Every day, I seem to be taking a lesson in "National Salvation and Resistance." In my proximity to them—they are a group of national heroes—I fully understand the lives and thoughts of the brave soldiers at the front line, the facts of their heroic resistance, and the stories of their glorious sacrifices.</p>
<p>"Living in the rear is like living on the front line," a phrase from the great German playwright Erwin Piscator suddenly surfaced in my mind. Here, I understand how the enemy's guns and cannons stirred their emotions and transformed their consciousness. The morale is so high that ordinary people cannot imagine it. This makes me even more convinced: "The final victory will inevitably belong to us."</p>
<p>"Miss Lu!" A Sichuan accent.</p>
<p>"What? Do you want tea?" Turning around, I knew that a soldier from the ×× division, ××× regiment was calling me. His name is Jiang Junde.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, I would like to ask you to write a letter for me and send it to my father at home."</p>
<p>I happily agreed. Then, he described the contents of the letter he wanted to send home:</p>
<p>"First, tell my father that I was slightly injured while fighting the enemy in Shanghai and am now staying in the hospital. Everything is very comfortable, and he should not worry about me. Also, say that I will go to the front line to kill the enemy again after I recover, to avenge our nation and country, and he should not worry about me."</p>
<p>He paused here. Perhaps the wound was hurting, and he rubbed the bandaged area of his right knee with his hand, but he did not show any weakness, making me feel his great spirit.</p>
<p>After a while, he continued:</p>
<p>"Miss Lu, please also tell him in the letter that this resistance is to fight for the nation's freedom and for the country's survival. We do not want to be slaves, so we must fight the enemy desperately. 'Loyalty to the country' is a man's duty! Also, tell him that loyalty and filial piety cannot be fully realized. Please tell him to take good care of himself and protect my younger siblings. Say that when I have killed all the enemies in our territory, then I can go back and be filial to him."</p>
<p>His words moved me deeply. I was excited, I was happy, and I admired his correct understanding of this resistance even more.</p>
<p>"Nothing else?"</p>
<p>"No, there is more. Tell him that if the family of my fiancée comes to talk, tell her to marry someone else. Say that I have already dedicated myself to the country and the people, and I am afraid of ruining her lifelong happiness." After a pause, he said again: "I am afraid that there is a shortage of pocket money at home. I will send the salary I receive from the post office, so please mention it in the letter. Say that I will send more money later if I have it."</p>
<p>At this time, two images suddenly floated in my mind. One is of patriots bravely sacrificing their happiness, holding guns, blowing bugles, and resisting the enemy for the independence and freedom of the motherland! The other is of those so-called high-class Chinese enjoying themselves in the Paramount Ballroom.</p>
<p>"The Turks have arrived under the walls of Byzantium, and the gentlemen there are still asleep." Oh, drunken and dreaming people! If you could stand in front of the patriots for one minute, I think you would truly be ashamed to death!</p>

His salary is insufficient to support his family, and he usually relies on borrowing to make ends meet. After the war, it has become even more difficult. However, my heart for saving the country not only dares not lag behind others but also often strives to be a leader. At this time of raising government bonds, Xiaolai, as the captain of the general team, should also do his best. Now, in the absence of any other way, I respectfully donate all the silver shields, silver tripods, and other silverware given by friends to purchase National Salvation Bonds. I transfer the love of my friends for me to love the country, so that even those who are as powerless as Xiaolai can be powerful. I am ashamed and excited to draw this. I hope you will understand."</p>

<p>Charitable Group Nursing Hospital</p>
<p>The Wartime Refugee Relief Association of the Joint Relief Association of Various Charitable Organizations has established a branch nursing hospital at 68 Yuyuan Road to provide medical care for wounded soldiers. Huang Dinghu, the son of Huang Hanzhi, Vice Chairman of the Association, serves as the director of the hospital. All operating expenses are raised by Huang Hanzhi and others. Dr. Ai Xianren, a German surgeon, has been hired to assist. In recent days, the hospital has admitted over 180 wounded soldiers, and over 40 have been cured and discharged.</p>
<p>Seamen's Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Commander Yu Hu, the Chinese Seamen's Anti-Enemy Support Association has been working extremely hard on rear-area affairs since the outbreak of the war, including comforting, transporting, rescuing, and fundraising. It has shown unique performance in all these aspects. In light of the intense fighting at the front lines in recent days, a relief team has been sent to rescue many of our wounded soldiers under heavy fire and immediately send them to the hospital. It is heard that the relief team's required trucks, gasoline, stretchers, equipment, and even the food expenses of the staff are all funded by the Seamen's Support Association.</p>

The hospital has three branches and can accommodate around 200 wounded soldiers. All surgical instruments and X-ray machines are available, making it a formal surgical hospital. It is also heard that the person in charge of the hospital said that as the weather is getting colder, there is a shortage of cotton quilts and cotton vests, and efforts are being made to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Heavy Machine Guns of Our Army in Baoshan Road Street Fighting Prepare to Sweep Enemy Troops</h3>
<h3>Cotton Production in Pudong on the Market; Please Handle Subsidized Loans</h3>
<p>Cotton production in various counties in Pudong is on the market, but it cannot be transported and sold, causing panic in the rural economy. Diao Yebai, a citizen of Fengxian, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department yesterday, requesting that cotton subsidized loans be launched early to facilitate financial turnover. The original text is as follows: "It is found that the economic center of the four counties of Pudong, Fengnan, Jinshan, and Chuansha has always been the export of large quantities of cotton. Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, yarn factories have closed, sales have been sluggish, and there is no formal price on the market. It is heard that each dan is only worth about five or six yuan. Farmers are deeply worried about the excessive losses. Cotton merchants have also been forced to stop weighing because they have not cleared their remaining goods and have no capital. As a result, finance has stagnated, causing panic to businesses, people, rich, and poor alike. Now that the land tax collection period is approaching and National Salvation Bonds are also being issued, funds are urgently needed everywhere. If no measures are taken to dredge the economic source, the situation will be even more desperate, and the impact will be significant. Previously, the Internal Affairs Department had a subsidized loan plan for this problem, and agricultural products were included in it. The autumn harvest in various counties in Pudong has already been put on the market and is urgently awaiting transportation. I dare to telegraph and request the Director of the Provincial Farmers' Bank to instruct the offices of the bank in the four counties of Pudong, Jinshan, Fengnan, and Chuansha to launch cotton subsidized loans as soon as possible. At the same time, set up warehouses as usual and open cotton pledge loans. On the one hand, ask the county governments to: ㊀ invite local merchants to reduce the monthly interest on cotton. ㊁ Invite local gentry, merchants, and small cotton dealers to raise funds for loan offices in various districts, towns, and villages to handle small cotton loans and collect scattered cotton catties to maintain people's daily lives. ㊂ Concentrate and store goods. There may be unexpected dangers in areas close to the war zone. ㊃ Stipulate that farmers with more than three dan of cotton are allowed to report to the Baojia chief to verify the weighing together with the township head, add a printed stamp on the cotton bale, report to the district office for joint and several liability guarantee, and issue a certificate. With this certificate, they can temporarily borrow from financial institutions, and the procedures are more stable. In summary, the above methods will not only provide an outlet for cotton production and circulate economic sources, but also benefit the anti-war military needs and people's livelihood. The views of a frog in a well are respectfully submitted for approval and implementation. I am grateful."</p>
<h3>National Salvation Movement</h3>

<p>Labor Circles</p>
<p>The labor and agricultural circles of this city convened a preparatory meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM to organize the All-China Labor Circles Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, drafted a simple charter, and submitted it to the various Anti-Japanese Support Associations for registration.

<p>Cartoon Circles</p>
<p>Today (the 20th), 'National Salvation Cartoons' is published, sponsored by the Cartoon Circles National Salvation Association. It is a nationwide mobilization of the cartoon circles to attack the enemy. The themes are popular and highly meaningful in awakening the people and striving for national salvation. Moreover, the selling price is lower than the cost, making it a truly mass-market reading material in this extraordinary period. This newspaper warmly welcomes various national salvation groups to purchase in large quantities and send them to the front lines to comfort the heroic anti-Japanese soldiers, or to post them in the back alleys and shelters. The newspaper hopes that all propaganda efforts in the rear will focus on the propaganda materials for all-out resistance in the current issue of "National Salvation Cartoons" to support national salvation work.</p>
<h3>The Tax Bureau Issues a Statement Regarding the Truth About Tax Payments Limited to Cash</h3>
<p>The recent reports regarding tax payments being limited to cash have attracted considerable attention from society. A reporter from Guomin News Agency, wanting to clarify the truth, specifically visited relevant personnel at the Tax Bureau. According to them, the bureau collects national taxes in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's order, which limits payments to legal tender and negotiable instruments that can be exchanged for legal tender. Drafts and remittances are not applicable. The bank had not added a seal of approval for cash payment to the application for the check submitted by the Da Zhonghua Company for tax payment previously, and only allowed remittance, so the bureau was unable to accept it. Furthermore, the Ministry responded to the Hubei Provincial Government's request to allow merchants to pay taxes by check by stating that the application process should still be followed, and did not approve remittance for tax payment. Therefore, the bureau's tax payments should be made in legal tender and negotiable instruments that can be exchanged for legal tender. The news reported by a certain newspaper on the 16th contains many misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Changshu Detains Rice, Shanghai People's Food Association Sends Personnel to Negotiate</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau Sends Another Letter to the County Government Urging Swift Release</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the incident of the Changshu County Government detaining grain, the shipment of river rice from the interior to Shanghai has gradually been blocked, causing great concern among various organizations and groups in Shanghai. The Municipal People's Food Regulation Committee, in order to coordinate the supply of food to all of Shanghai and dredge the sources, has been deeply affected. Therefore, Lu Muqin was specifically sent to Changshu to negotiate with the county government. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government urging the county to release the grain quickly in order to maintain provincial laws and regulations. The Municipal Social Bureau also, in accordance with the document from the Jiangsu Provincial Food and Fuel Regulation Office, sent a letter to the county requesting the release of both the ships and the shipowners. Furthermore, after the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a joint letter from the Lianyi Association of merchants shipping goods from Shanghai and the Public Association of Rice Dealers, requesting them to vigorously strive for the release, the chamber immediately sent a letter to the Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, stating (details omitted above): Upon investigation, before the batch of rice was loaded in Changshu, the People's Food Regulation Committee, jointly organized by the Shanghai military, political, police, and commercial sectors, issued a certificate proving that it was legal trade and there were no irregularities. This can serve as irrefutable evidence. After the detention, the Shanghai Office of the Jinghu Garrison Command issued a pass, and the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau sent a telegram to the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, instructing your county government to release the cargo. Your local government has disregarded the impartial handling of the matter by the responsible officials of the Jiangsu and Shanghai provinces and cities. Where is the law to be placed? We request your association to vigorously strive for the release of the people and the rice, truly appreciating the public interest.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Writes to Water and Electricity Company Requesting Acceptance of Chinese Bank Checks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the French Water and Electricity Company yesterday, stating: Sirs, We have received a letter from Chen Gengyu, a resident of 220 Route Pichon, reporting that the French Water and Electricity Company refuses to accept checks for water and electricity bills, requiring payment in cash or the use of foreign bank checks. He requests our assistance in negotiating a solution. We have investigated and found that foreign-owned telephone companies within the concession have been accepting checks from Chinese banks for payments, recognizing that the creditworthiness of Chinese banks has been improving over the years and is no less than that of foreign banks. There is no reason for a company receiving payments to discriminate. This action only creates difficulties for customers and gives Chinese people the unfavorable impression that the division between Chinese and foreigners has not been eliminated. For the convenience of the majority of your Chinese customers and for the sake of your long-standing good relationship, we trust that you will not persist in this prejudice. Therefore, we are writing to you requesting a satisfactory response.</p>

<h3>The Luodian Front is Quiet and Peaceful, Enemy Forces Attack Liuhang in Two Routes</h3>
<p>Our Troops Intercept and Defend the Original Positions Separately, Fierce Battle on Huangxing Road Last Night, Enemy Forces Collapsed and Retreated, Desperate Measures, Enemy Planes Scatter Absurd Leaflets</p>
<p>Since our main force concentrated on the first line of defense, the enemy is now taking a central breakthrough plan, with Liuhang as the target of attack. After 12:00 last night, the enemy attacked in two routes, one from Shulibiao on the east side of Luodian, southward towards Zhangjiazhai, Xiezhaizi, and Wuzhai, and the other from Daijiazhai and Lijiazhai on the northeast side of Liuhang, towards Xiaozhujiazhai, Zhuzhai, and Jinjiawan, hoping to break through our police line and concentrate forces to attack the central point of Liuhang. The battle last night was exceptionally fierce. The enemy attacking southward from Shulibiao was immediately repelled by our army, and we continued to defend our original positions. The battle at Zhuzhai and Xiaozhujiazhai was even more intense, and the enemy artillery also concentrated its bombardment. Our army fought bravely, but due to the dense enemy artillery fire, Zhuzhai and Xiaozhujiazhai were once lost, retreating to Jinjiawan and fighting the enemy across the river. We used heavy machine guns and small cannons to densely sweep the enemy, and on the other hand, we attacked the enemy's rear from Yangmu Bridge. Fierce fighting continued until 3:00 AM, when the enemy forces could not hold out and retreated, and our army regained the original positions of Zhuzhai and Xiaozhujiazhai. There was no battle in Luodian Town last night, and there was only minor contact in Zhabei. Taking advantage of the enemy's change of guard, our army fired on the enemy with rifles and machine guns. The enemy was momentarily panicked and responded hastily, suffering many casualties. The enemy artillery team in Hongkou Park fired on our positions from time to time, intermittently, with the aim of only disrupting and warning us, causing no loss to us. Furthermore, the enemy attempted to destroy our rear transportation. Yesterday, they continuously bombarded Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai with artillery, but due to inaccurate targets, there was no damage.</p>
<h3>War News Brief</h3>
<p>North of the Huishan area, the sound of machine guns, rifles, and heavy artillery did not stop all night. Between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, there was fierce fighting near Bazibao and the North Railway Station. There was also artillery fire near Baoshan Road, but the sound was sparse. The western district and the Huangpu River were quiet and peaceful. At 7:45 AM this morning, the sound of machine guns could be heard continuously near the North Railway Station. At 7:55 AM, an enemy plane flew to the South City to drop leaflets. Between 7:30 AM and 8:00 AM, the artillery fire north of Jiangwan was quite intense. Between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM, a fire broke out near Hongkou Park (i.e., north of the enemy headquarters). The old factory of the Commercial Press in Zhabei was bombarded. Between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, there was artillery fire near Baoshan Road and Baotong Road.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Liuhang Was Smashed By Our Forces</h3>
<p>To Threaten Our First Line of Defense, We Intercepted and Killed Many Enemies</p>
<p>After the enemy's plan to attack Luodian failed, they changed their target yesterday and invaded Liuhang, attempting to break through our central line and threaten our first line of defense. That area is located between Luodian and Dachang, and is an important town on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Our army had made preparations early and had heavily armed troops stationed there. Starting from 10:00 PM last night (the 19th), the enemy launched a two-pronged attack. One part launched a fierce attack on our Wuzhai position north of Liuhang, which was met with a head-on blow from our forces and made no progress. The other part, with extremely elite troops, used several armored vehicles for cover and launched a fierce attack on our warning line at Zhaowangmiao, Zhuzhai, and Xiaozhuzhai in front of Liuhang. We swept them with machine guns, killing many enemies. Although the enemy was attacked, they still tried to stubbornly advance. Our army was exceptionally strong and rushed out of the trenches for hand-to-hand combat. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy finally broke through our line of defense. Our army then retreated slightly, confronting the enemy across the two banks of the Jinjiawan small stream. Soon, our reinforcements arrived, charged across the stream, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy many times, falling forward but continuing the attack. Finally, the enemy was defeated and the original warning line was restored. In this battle, both the enemy and our forces used elite troops to bravely engage in hand-to-hand combat for several hours, so both sides suffered heavy losses. However, we were finally able to restore our original position, and the reinforcements continued to arrive, and an order was immediately issued to launch a counterattack.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Zhabei Ended in a Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>The Enemy Headquarters Was Hit and Caught Fire</p>
<p>Near Bazibao and the North Railway Station, the enemy suddenly launched an attack on that line with a dense force at around 8:00 PM last night. At the same time, the enemy artillery also concentrated on indiscriminate bombardment of that area, hoping to suppress our rear, but all were ineffective. In addition to immediately responding to the battle, our rear artillery also launched a fierce counterattack. After about an hour of fighting, the enemy headquarters near Hongkou Park was hit by our artillery and caught fire. At around 7:40 AM this morning, a small unit of enemy troops attacked near the North Railway Station and was swept away by our machine guns, with more than a dozen enemy casualties. Before long, they tried to peek again, but were still repelled by our army. Our army maintained its original line of defense.</p>
<h3>There Was Fierce Fighting on Huangxing Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Two Enemy Attacks Were Repelled By Our Forces</p>
<p>About a thousand enemy troops in the city center took advantage of their heavy artillery cover at midnight yesterday and launched a fierce attack on our army positions on Huangxing Road and Ningguo Road. Several armored vehicles were their vanguard. Our army calmly waited, and when they were close, they immediately met them head-on with hand grenades, mortars, and small cannons. Seeing that the armored vehicles had lost their effectiveness, the enemy rushed with infantry. Our army then jumped out of the trenches and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. The enemy was frustrated and immediately retreated, but soon came again. Our army immediately launched a dense sweeping fire with machine guns and other light and heavy weapons, and showed great power, rushing into the enemy ranks, charging left and right, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Seeing that the situation was unsustainable, the enemy urgently increased reinforcements, and our rear reinforcements arrived in time, so the fierce battle began again. The sound of machine guns, rifles, and heavy artillery did not stop all night, and the fighting continued until before dawn this morning, when the enemy retreated due to heavy casualties. Our army held its original position.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Retreats to the Northeast of Luodian Town</h3>
<p>Waiting for Reinforcements, the Frontline is Quiet</p>
<p>The enemy launched three general offensives against Luodian, and after our brave resistance, they suffered heavy casualties. Although their troops once again occupied the town, there was no complete building left after the enemy's dense artillery fire and arbitrary burning, and they were threatened by our heavy troops on Xiaotangzi. They dared not hold on stubbornly, so they also retreated to the northeast of the town to deploy defenses, waiting for reinforcements. Therefore, the battle on the front line was quiet, and artillery shells were occasionally fired at our rear positions, but there was no damage to us.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Pudong Repels Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>Twelve Enemy Planes Flew to Pudong This Morning to Reconnoiter</p>
<p>The Japanese side has not yet taken an offensive against our army positions in Pudong. The entire line was quiet last night. Only enemy boats in Pudong patrolled back and forth. Our army was on high alert at various ports, and only sporadic machine gun fire occurred between the two sides, without any intense action. This morning at 9:00 AM, twelve enemy planes, divided into four teams, circled over the area around Qichang Wharf, firing machine guns from time to time. At the same time, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River also opened fire to assist. At 10:00 AM, the situation calmed down. Our side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>An Enemy Plane Crashed into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Fifty-One Enemy Planes Flew West This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, as soon as dawn broke, many enemy planes flew to our positions in the Pudong area to reconnoiter. One of the seaplanes was hit by our machine gun fire. In a hurry, it tried to escape to Songkou, but when it flew near the Mitsui Wharf, the damaged fuselage was severely shaken, causing it to crash into the Huangpu River near the Mitsui Wharf and sink immediately.</p>
<p>According to news, enemy planes attacked the capital twice yesterday, but to no avail. This morning (the 20th), another fifty-one enemy planes, in formation, went west along the railway line. They passed Kunshan at about 11:00 AM and continued to fly west.</p>
<h3>Enemy Deaths Have Exceeded 20,000</h3>
<p>The Kurume Division Has Been Almost Completely Eliminated, One Division of the Fifth Reinforcements Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since the Shanghai battle broke out on August 13, the total number of enemy deaths has exceeded 20,000. In addition, those killed in action by the air force are not included. At the same time, the most severely casualties were the Kurume Division, the enemy forces who first attacked our Wusong, Zhanghuabang, Shizilin, and Luodian areas. Because this batch of enemy troops was repeatedly attacked by our army, there were almost no survivors. The enemy naval special marine corps occupying the Hongkou district was also almost completely wiped out. Therefore, the enemy's losses in this invasion of Shanghai are the highest record in the Sino-Japanese war. Furthermore, according to reports received from relevant parties, the enemy's fifth reinforcement force, totaling one division, has now been mobilized from Nagasaki, Kobe, and other places, and is expected to arrive here in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Again Drop Absurd Leaflets</h3>
<p>Two enemy planes flew over the concession to the Nanshi area at 7:30 AM this morning, circling and reconnoitering, and dropping absurd and shameless leaflets. The enemy planes flew south of Xieqiao in Nanshi to the Longhua Road area, turned and flew towards Pudong. However, when the enemy planes flew low, they fired intermittent machine guns at pedestrians, but did not drop any bombs this morning.</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM this morning (the 20th), more than a dozen enemy planes scouted Pudong and South Shanghai, dropping more than a dozen bombs in areas such as Zhenru and Zhongshan Road, hoping to destroy our rear transportation, but the damage to us was minimal. Soon after, seventeen of the planes gathered and flew in a southeast direction.</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand Enemy Corpses Transported Back to Japan</h3>
<p>Blood Stains Were Visible on the Roads Traveled By the Vehicles</p>
<p>According to reliable news, at 11:00 PM on the 18th, more than thirty enemy trucks, each carrying thirty to forty enemy corpses wrapped in black cloth and covered with tarpaulins, passed through Wusong Road and Broadway Road to the Yangshupu Wharf, where they were hurriedly loaded onto the enemy transport ship Shanghai Maru, which was moored there, and transported back to their country. According to eyewitnesses, the last of the trucks carried mostly broken feet and arms, and incomplete enemy corpses, with blood dripping and some exposed beyond the tarpaulin. The scene was too tragic to bear. Yesterday, when people passed by the roads traveled by the trucks, they could still see blood stains as far as the Yangshupu Wharf. It is estimated that the total number of enemy corpses in this batch was more than a thousand.</p>
<h3>An Enemy Plane Landed in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Wuxi] At 10:00 AM on the 19th, an enemy plane that attacked Nanjing was damaged and landed on the Jiangtan in Fuxing Town, which belongs to the county. The two pilots swam to escape, fired their guns to resist arrest, and were shot and killed by strong men. One strong man was also injured (Special Dispatch on the 19th).</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Outside Lianyungang Sailed Elsewhere</h3>
<p>Sea News, The enemy warships outside Lianyungang have sailed elsewhere after we blockaded the harbor. However, seaplanes sometimes fly over Lianyungang to scout. On the morning of the 15th, its tail was damaged by our anti-aircraft guns and it fell into the outer sea (Special Dispatch on the 19th).</p>
<h3>The Enemy Is Engaging in Scaremongering, Saying That Nanjing Has Become a Dangerous Area</h3>
<p>Will Send a Large Squad of Enemy Planes to Bomb, The Enemy Notifies Foreign Nationals to Evacuate</p>
<p>Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, sent a note to the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, stating that the Japanese Navy Air Force will bomb our country's capital on the afternoon of the 21st of this month. Please notify all foreign nationals in Beijing to evacuate to safe places by the morning of that day to avoid danger. All foreign warships and merchant ships berthed there are also requested to sail to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the foreign consulates in Shanghai are scheduled to meet this afternoon to discuss the matter in order to decide on a plan and respond to the Japanese side. It is also learned that the French side will definitely not make plans to evacuate.</p>
<p>According to confirmed news, the French Consul General in Shanghai replied to the Japanese side this morning that the French Embassy and Consulate in Nanjing, and the warships on the Jiangmian in Xiaguan, cannot withdraw. Please pay attention to all French interests in the capital of China.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army's Encirclement Attempt in North China Fails</h3>
<p>Our Grand Army in Pingnan Is Completely and Securely Deployed; Fierce Fighting Erupts on the Left Flank of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line; Enemy Troops at Xingji Station Have Already Retreated</p>
<p>[Jinan] There are no changes on the front today. On the left flank, a certain unit of our fresh troops is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy, killing many in hand-to-hand combat. They once recaptured several villages, but due to the lack of fortifications, they returned to their original positions. A certain regiment of ours arrived two or three miles south of Xingji Station. The enemy at Xingji Station had already retreated. We are guarding the Niangniang River south of the station. Employees of the Xingji Machinery Plant have been ordered to prepare to return to the station. Several enemy planes bombed Cangzhou Station this morning, injuring one person and damaging the power lines. One plane scouted the Xingqi River in this city via Sangyuan. At 4 p.m., twenty-one planes passed over Linyi and Tengxian to scout Xuzhou, then flew back to Haizhou. Three more planes strafed south of Xingji. At the same time, an enemy armored train arrived south of Xingji. It seemed they intended to attack tonight, but they were repelled by our armored train. Furthermore, over eighty remnants of the enemy at Lilou have been surrounded by us. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to a statement by the Japanese military headquarters here, Japanese troops are continuing to advance south of Beiping. At the same time, they acknowledge that Chinese troops are moving southwest in excellent order. Sources here point out that the failure of the Japanese attempt to encircle has been confirmed by the Japanese side. In Shanxi, the Chinese troop positions are extremely secure, and repeated Japanese attacks have been unsuccessful. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to news received here today, the Japanese army's attempt to encircle Chinese troops in North China has been confirmed to have failed. Five thousand Chinese troops fifty kilometers south of Beiping have completed their deployments securely amidst heavy rain. The Japanese used mechanized units to bomb and pursue, but did not achieve the desired victory. Furthermore, they consider the changes in position by the Chinese troops to be strategically unpredictable, and therefore feel quite apprehensive. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to a reporter from the Haitong News Agency who personally inspected the Japanese positions between Beiping and the Pinghan Railway, the route of the Japanese troops can be traced by the bullet holes and the ruins of collapsed walls. The deep trenches dug by the Chinese troops to obstruct tanks are visible everywhere. However, the reporter didn't see the corpses of fallen officers or soldiers on the battlefield because both sides had buried them. The reporter went on to say that the failure of the Japanese encirclement attempt can be proven by the fact that very few prisoners were captured when Zhuozhou fell on Saturday. This is because the Chinese troops had completely withdrawn in orderly formation twelve hours before the Japanese troops entered the city. And the other Japanese advances encountered fierce and determined resistance from the Chinese troops. (30th National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Air Defense Drill Held in Berlin</h3>
<p>Total Mobilization of the City; Extremely Tense Situation</p>
<p>[Berlin] The city's air defense drill is scheduled to begin tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. However, from 1:00 a.m., all personnel in charge of air defense, police, fire brigades, ambulance teams, and anti-gas teams will be fully mobilized. The city police also worked all day today, posting signs with the words "Resident Shelters" at designated locations in various districts. Three anti-aircraft guns were installed on the rooftops of the Aviation Bureau, and powerful searchlights illuminated the sky all night. According to the planned procedure, "enemy" planes will drop incendiary and poison gas bombs on the Imperial Hotel and the Potterdamer department store tomorrow morning. (Note: Before becoming Chancellor, Hitler resided in the Imperial Hotel for many years.) As soon as the bombing is complete, five hundred people disguised as victims of poisoning and bombing will be scattered in front of the hotel, and the ambulance team will transport the "dead" to the "cemetery," namely the Tiergarten Park, for burial. The injured will be treated in various rescue hospitals. Each of these people disguised as casualties will receive a reward of five marks per day. In addition, the fire brigade will immediately drive to various thoroughfares to practice extinguishing fires after the air raid siren sounds. At the same time, the city's anti-aircraft guns will also fire intensely at enemy planes. The scene at that time will definitely be extremely tense. (Havas Dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Barbaric Acts of the Enemy</h3>
<p>Residents of Dexing Lane Stabbed to Death; Seven Hundred Workers in the Eastern District Shot</p>
<p>The barbaric acts of the enemy are constantly appearing, and the number of innocent civilians who have been tragically killed is countless. On the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Police found a Chinese man, about thirty years old, who had been killed by a rifle in Dexing Lane at the intersection of Hainan Road and North Jiangxi Road. Three days later, yesterday at 10:00 a.m., the Shanghai Municipal Police found another man, also about thirty years old, dead in the house at No. 27 Dexing Lane. It was discovered that he had been stabbed to death with a bayonet. The case was reported to the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Zhang Zongru and forensic doctor Zhang Yan to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the corpse had a bayonet wound on the thenar area of the left hand, a bayonet wound on the abdomen and wrist, and a bayonet wound on the right back. It was confirmed that he had been stabbed to death with a bayonet. Since no relatives of the deceased could be found, the body was ordered to be buried at the Pushan Villa. It is understood that there are still some residents living in the lane.</p>
<p>The Yangshupu area in the eastern district of Shanghai is a district with many factories, with a total of 700,000 workers. Although many had fled after the August 13th Incident, a small number had not left. Yesterday, we met a refugee from that area, Mr. Chen, who is over fifty years old. He said that about ten days ago, he and more than seven hundred others fled to Yuanfang Road, where a team of enemy soldiers ordered the young and strong to stand in one place and massacred them all with machine guns. Only eighty or so elderly and weak people were left, and he himself had been stabbed in the face.</p>
<h3>Eight European and American Statesmen Broadcast Speeches on Peace</h3>
<p>Hull Says Complete Isolation Is Impossible; Eden Expresses Willingness to Cooperate Economically with the U.S.</p>
<p>[New York] The National Peace Conference today broadcast the speeches of important statesmen from eight countries on the issue of world peace to one hundred million listeners in more than sixty countries. U.S. Secretary of State Hull was one of the speakers, stating that while "we are determined both to avoid embroilment and to avoid entanglement in the armed conflicts of other nations," this policy "must be implemented in a way that will contribute to establishing conditions everywhere under which peace can be maintained." "Complete isolation in this new world is impossible. If order and law disappear in the world, the security of the United States will be greatly harmed." "Some believe that peace can only be achieved after aggression and conquest. This is a delusion. A country that starts a war, initially believing that lasting peace lies in the complete suppression of the enemy, will eventually see that the enemy's future still exists." Hull also said that any country that does not pay attention to the safety or interests of its overseas citizens will soon have even its most basic rights disregarded. In his view, economic improvement is the best hope for peace, because prosperous people are less likely to be tempted into war, while poor countries that see life as expendable are more likely to take a gamble or resort to militarism to achieve their goals. British Foreign Secretary Eden also broadcast a speech from Geneva, stating that there is no reason to be overly pessimistic about the economic situation of the United States or other countries in the world. Although international trade has encountered difficulties, there are signs of recovery. He hoped that Britain could establish an agreement with the United States to reduce tariffs based on the most-favored-nation principle, which would not only benefit both parties but also the world. Most countries are more prosperous than last year, which alone shows that a policy of peace is appropriate. Other politicians who participated in the broadcast included French Prime Minister Xu Dan, Bison Chilann, Canadian Prime Minister King, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, Colombian President Lopez, and Czech Prime Minister Hodza.

<h3>Trivial Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>There's a saying: "Adapt to circumstances." Adapting to circumstances means avoiding danger when you see it coming. "Circumstances" here refers to airplanes. "Adapting" means avoiding. The Shanghai-Songhu battle is now extremely fierce. When enemy planes attack or our planes sortie, passersby stop to look up or climb onto roofs to watch from afar. This spirit of adventure is admirable, but it's likely that stray bullets will cause unnecessary sacrifice. It's really not necessary. Therefore, the four characters "adapt to circumstances" can be interpreted in a distorted way. Under the current conditions, with cannons and airplanes causing mass casualties, our lives are as insignificant as ants. They are not worth regretting, but it's better to sacrifice oneself in the trenches on the front lines than to sacrifice oneself in the streets or on rooftops while watching. It's more worthwhile to be killed while fighting the enemy than to be killed while watching. The sacrifice would be the same, but the value would be different.</p>

<h3>Painful Memories (8)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shudi</p>
<p>㊇ Flight</p>
<p>Those who are able to flee from slavery are luckier than those who endure the lives of slaves!</p>
<p>I had originally planned to come south at the beginning of July. Afterwards, due to various reasons, I repeatedly delayed it, postponed it, ...(Everyone thought that although the situation was tense, we could still watch the wind. When it was unbearable, we would run.) However, suddenly, like a kite with a broken string, the ancient city was captured by the enemy! At this time, I was like a fly trapped in a glass house: bumping around everywhere.</p>
<p>I ran around outside all day, declaring that I had to leave this enemy's rear. I planned to escape in disguise along small roads, and I planned to crawl out through the sorghum fields, and I planned... When friends met, they all talked about escape methods, but in the end, they couldn't find a suitable one.</p>
<p>"I believe that your eagerness to leave this place is not just to escape!" My closest friend, Tao, said this to me several times to comfort me.</p>
<p>"I will definitely work hard to not let your kindness be in vain!" I said firmly.</p>
<p>On July 5th, the Beiping-Tianjin railway resumed service for the first day. I quickly bought a ticket from China Travel Service, planning to leave on the 6th. However -</p>
<p>"That's not appropriate," a relative of mine advised me. "If you don't inquire about a boat ticket, going to Tianjin to stay is more dangerous than staying here!"</p>
<p>The ticket was returned to the travel agency, and at the same time, I asked them to send a telegram to Tianjin to book a cabin to Shanghai. The telegram was relayed by radio, but there was no reply for a day or two. On the 8th, the radio was also cut off. Fortunately, there were many people in the same situation, so the travel agency decided to send someone to Tianjin to handle this matter specifically.</p>
<p>Within these few days, many of my friends left. I asked, "There's no way to get a boat ticket. Is it okay to waste time in Tianjin?"</p>
<p>The unanimous answer was: "Every step further is a step better."</p>
<p>The person from the travel agency returned from Tianjin. The answer to the many people surrounding him and asking for news was a series of shakes of the head and waves of the hand: "There's no way! There's no way! It's not even certain if there's a ship, and the tickets are even harder to get."</p>
<p>The remaining option was to "take every step further as a step better." Early in the morning on the 11th, I managed to buy a ticket at the travel agency from a crowd of people who were fighting as if they were in a melee. It goes without saying that I was covered in sweat after getting the ticket. Even a button on my shirt was squeezed off. I thought I was very early when I arrived at the station at five o'clock in the morning on the 13th. However, the station was already crowded with people. It was said that some people had been sleeping at the station for a day or two without being able to board the train. The platform tickets were not for sale. Only Mr. Tao saw me off. He hadn't slept all night to see me off, and arrived at the station at three o'clock. The train was scheduled to depart at seven o'clock, but it still hadn't left at nine o'clock. Mr. Tao and I paced back and forth on the platform dozens of times. All around us, coming and going, were enemy soldiers and Ronin. We didn't dare to say anything to each other; and we couldn't say anything, either. There was a feeling of wanting to vomit. To reduce this pain, I urged Mr. Tao to go back before the train left.</p>
<p>"Well, goodbye then!" Mr. Tao extended his hand.</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Goodbye!" I grasped his hand firmly.</p>
<p>We said "goodbye" to each other dozens of times with profound meaning. — My "goodbye" meant his coming south and the day we would stand on the same front.</p>
<p>In this dining car I was riding, even the tables were occupied. There were no seats. I had to stand. However, a few minutes before departure, a coolie-like man approached me: "Want a seat, sir? Three dollars."</p>
<p>"How about two dollars?" I bargained.</p>
<p>"That old lady over there," he pointed, "even spent five dollars."</p>
<p>Sitting down was even more uncomfortable: the people standing next to me were simply "meat screens," blocking every bit of air. The car was full of the stench of sweat. The Japanese soldiers guarding the car were standing right next to me. There was a very disgusting smell of sweat coming from these two short and wide fellows, who were covered in cumbersome steel, kettles, bayonets, etc., and constantly moving their bodies. This made me very vigilant: I desperately avoided touching any objects on their bodies. Because I saw with my own eyes: a passenger came in and bumped their kettle, apologized, apologized, and was still desperately choked on the neck by them with their hands. Another person brushed their shoulders when getting off the train and was kicked in the butt with a leather shoe, causing them to stagger more than ten feet away, and let out a cry of "Ouch". Sometimes, they leveled their guns, aimed them at people, loaded bullets into the chamber, and then jumped out one by one; whenever a bullet got stuck, they would scold "jiji gugu", while desperately patting the "bolt." If there were a "misfire", the people shot down by him would fall down together like a string of fish. Everyone in the car was worrying with trepidation about this tragedy that could happen at any moment. The number of times the train stopped along the way was uncountable, sometimes to let enemy troop trains pass, sometimes for inspection; sometimes the enemy stopped us for no reason. After stopping for a while, they ordered us to leave quickly. It is said that on this day, because there were too many people crowded on the train, which made inspection difficult, the number of inspections was less than in previous times. When the train passed Fengtai, Langfang, Yangcun! and other places, large groups of enemy troops who had collapsed from Nankou were sitting on both sides of the railway. Some didn't have hats, some had lost their bullet belts, and some even lost a shoe, walking back and forth on the gravel with one bare foot... The state of their disarray was imaginable.</p>
<p>The train arrived at Tianjin East Station at 7:30. The three-hour train journey had taken almost ten hours. However, it was the fastest record since the railway was opened. The train the day before had only arrived at twelve o'clock that night. There were more than a dozen enemy soldiers standing opposite each other at the station exit, with their guns clamped under their armpits and with bayonets fixed. The passengers had to turn sideways and walk out of the station through the dense bayonet tips that were less than two feet apart. I was not inspected, but some people were inspected very strictly. I don't know what the criteria were. Maybe it depends on the looks? — I thought. I also thought: Well, what kind of looks require inspection? The look of a security team member? (Later, I heard that a few days ago, a traveler had already been checked and was about to leave the station when a gust of wind blew the bottom of his long robe, revealing a pair of yellow pants. As a result, he was shot in the back by an enemy soldier and died. At the time, no one understood why, but later they realized that it was probably because he was wearing pants like those of a security team member.) The look of someone who works for a central government agency? The look of someone from the cultural world? The look of a communist? The look of a Blue Shirt Society member... As I thought, I was secretly happy for myself: I probably dressed completely differently from the people in the above categories, so I was spared the inspection. I was very happy to sit on a rickshaw and walk on the road... Just as I was happy, someone suddenly shouted from the roadside.</p>
<p>A "friendly soldier" ran over, pointing to my box. I hurriedly put on a smiling face, opened the box and asked him to look. He rummaged through it, and it was all clothes; and apart from that, there was nothing else. He waved his hand, and roared at the rickshaw puller in words I didn't understand. The meaning was probably to tell him to get lost quickly.</p>
<p>When the rickshaw pulled up to the French Bridge, it was already under martial law, and I couldn't enter the French Concession. I got off and wanted to call my friend. To get a pass to come and pick me up. However, after borrowing from several places, I learned that all the power lines had been cut off by the Japanese army. I had no choice but to prepare to spend the night temporarily on the banks of the French Bridge, like the other hundreds of fellow refugees.</p>
<p>That night, the banks of the French Bridge in Tianjin were filled with the cries of children and the moans of the sick. Japanese military vehicles, however, continued to rush back and forth from nearby; when passing this place, they slowed down and slowly moved the flashlights, shining on people.</p>
<p>At a little after nine o'clock, a torrential rain suddenly fell. In an instant, the refugee crowd on the banks of the French Bridge presented a miserable scene of wailing and struggling. My box was floating on the water surface. My shoes were filled with water. Every time I moved, the water would splash and make a "squishing" sound. My body was wet and shivering, but it wasn't cold. A French concession policeman on guard told me that it was dangerous to spend the night like that: first, the Japanese soldiers might shoot at the refugees; second, getting wet all night could cause problems. "Well, what can I do?" I asked. So, he told me to wait near the bridge and take a foreigner's car later. Sure enough, after a while, he stopped a car that was passing by and muttered a few words, telling me to pay five dollars, and then he let me take my box and get into the car. Judging from his face and figure, the driver was probably a Russian. When the car reached the entrance in front of the French Bridge, a French policeman came forward to take a look. The Russian driver stuck his head out of the car window for a moment, and then drove past without any obstruction.</p>
<p>My friend Li's house only had five or six rooms upstairs and downstairs. At this time, it was occupied by four or five families who had fled from Beiping. My impression was that there were people everywhere. When I frowned and asked Li if there were any hotels nearby, he immediately understood what I meant and laughed: "Haha, I know you think it's too crowded here. But every hotel in this concession is full, and even the space under the stairs is occupied by people." That night, I had to sleep on the floor temporarily.</p>
<p>The ship was a big problem. There were probably eighty or ninety thousand people staying in Tianjin waiting for a ship. The most popular ships were naturally those of the British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire companies; however, only occasional ships were announced to be setting sail. Tickets had sold out ten days in advance. In addition, there were two unlicensed pirate ships that might sail, but the dates were also uncertain. I asked people everywhere to help me find a ship ticket. As long as someone was willing to transfer it, I would be willing to pay several times the price. In the end, I found a ticket to Yantai on a pirate ship. The original price was one and a half yuan, the original buyer spent eight and a half yuan, but the price they gave me was twenty-four yuan.</p>
<p>Li did not agree with me doing this. First, it was a ship that smuggled goods, the captain was Japanese, and riding it was too risky; second, the sailing date was unknown! But I thought: precisely because it was a smuggling ship, it might be safer; and secondly, I would leave whenever it sailed, because there was no other way anyway. — To be honest, I didn't have much hope of being able to leave on this ship.</p>
<p>However, fortunately, the ship sailed on the fourth day and safely brought me to Yantai. Apart from being threatened and shouted at by the Japanese soldiers on the warships several times after Dagu and Tanggu, and the ship being too crowded, I was quite satisfied.</p>
<p>In a total of six days, I arrived in Yantai from Beiping. When they heard the name of the ship I was on, my friends in Yantai stuck out their tongues, thinking that I had taken too much risk; but after calculating the date for me, they all said that I had travelled faster.</p>
<p>When I was breathing the air of freedom, I couldn't help but miss the city of Beiping and the people inside who hadn't escaped. (9, 14, in Shanghai)</p>

<p>The Wuxi and Jiangyin Native Place Associations jointly established four shelters. The Association hired the Zhenji to send refugees back to their hometowns. It has already sent out more than 32,000 refugees. Recently, the Xiexing Company also sent out more than 2,000 people. There are still more than 400 refugees in various shelters. It is said that all the refugees will be sent back to their hometowns, so as to end the operation.</p>
<p>Jishenghui Shelter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jishenghui independently operates the Society's No. 1 Shelter at Yufo Temple on Pinlang Road, and the Society's No. 2 Shelter at the Daodong Girls' School on Aiwengyi Road. A total of 2,325 refugees were registered in the Yufo Temple from August 15th to September 15th. It is a cyclical process to avoid overcrowding. Of these, 1,447 refugees have been sent to Guangdong, Jiangsu, Nanjing, Anhui, Hefei and 20 other counties in batches. There are still 878 refugees. In the Daodong Girls' School, a total of 723 refugees were registered from August 14th to September 15th. Of these, 360 refugees have been sent to Guangdong, Yangzhou, Ningbo, Yin County and 5 counties in Shanghai. There are still 363 people. It is found that the Society's two shelters have successively accommodated more than 3,000 people. More than 1,700 people have been sent away in batches, and more than 1,200 people remain in the two shelters. It is a great problem that the shelters are full and insufficient.</p>
<p>Repatriation of Dinghai Refugees</p>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai sent out more than 1,000 refugees on the Xinde Ferry the day before yesterday. There are still more than 3,000 refugees in the shelter. The lease term of the Maler Ferry has expired. After negotiations between the Dinghai Native Place Association and the Ferry, the Ferry sent Dinghai refugees back to their hometowns yesterday. In the future, refugees from eastern Zhejiang will be transported by inland river or land.</p>

Subsequently, Mr. Meinl, the chairman of the Czech People's Association in China, delivered a speech in English, praising Masaryk's accomplishments in establishing the nation.</p>
<h3>Support Association's Propaganda Committee Forms Domestic Propaganda Group</h3>
<p>Set to Depart on October 1st</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, recognizing the importance of domestic propaganda in the prolonged war of resistance, has decided to organize a domestic propaganda group. The group is scheduled to depart next month, on the 1st, to conduct propaganda in various provinces, cities, and counties. Yan Keding, a propaganda committee member and director of the song group, has been appointed as the group leader, and He Shide, a professor at the Shanghai Xinhua Art School, has been appointed as the deputy group leader. Active preparations are underway, and all staff members have been carefully assigned to four categories: ㊀ choral singing, ㊁ drama, ㊂ folk song research, and ㊃ current affairs lectures on the war of resistance. Detailed plans are being drafted in succession. The departure points will be divided into two phases, with the first phase covering nine provinces and the second phase covering six provinces, all of which have been carefully studied.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Collects Funds for Troops Three Times</h3>
<p>Since the start of the all-out war of resistance, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union has initiated a campaign to collect anti-enemy comfort funds from its members, which has now been carried out three times. The first time was in July, when a total of 271.40 national currency units were collected and entirely transferred to the Military Affairs Commission to be used for comforting the soldiers at the front lines. The second time was in August, when a total of 1,415.80 national currency units were collected. Aside from transferring 1,000 national currency units to the Military Affairs Commission for discretionary use in comforting troops, 1,500 burlap sacks worth 200 national currency units, 2 military telephones worth 145 national currency units, and 4 bicycles worth 140 national currency units were purchased and sent to the front lines for use. The shortfall was covered by funds allocated from the union's capital. This month marks the third fundraising effort, and as of yesterday, a total of 1,286 national currency units and 21 national bonds have been collected. Among these, 1,000 national currency units were already remitted to the Military Affairs Commission on the 16th. The remaining funds will be used to purchase burlap sacks, cotton, and other necessary supplies based on the needs of the front lines for their use. Fundraising efforts for this month are still ongoing.</p>

<h3>A Planet in the Japanese Political World: "Kazushige Ugaki" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fei Dan</p>
<p>As for Ugaki's relationship with political parties, it is naturally closer because he has served as the Minister of the Army in five cabinets and has had more contact with party members. Moreover, when he was the Minister of the Army, it was when Japanese party politics was quite powerful, and he was indeed influenced by political parties quite a bit. Therefore, he is relatively politically astute. But if civil servant party members can become Prime Ministers, then why can't military men with ties to political parties become Prime Ministers? Of course, the reasons are not sufficient. In reality, Ugaki's political skills are too sharp. Under his wing, there are truly strategists like clouds. If Ugaki comes to power, young military officers are in danger of being suppressed. This is the reason why they resolutely oppose Ugaki.</p>
<p>As for the size of Ugaki's sphere of influence, it is truly astonishing and unparalleled in Japan. His influence is pervasive in the financial world, political world, military world, bureaucracy, and the press. In every aspect, there are elements that support Ugaki. As soon as there is a ripple in the political situation, financial tycoons will come out to pay for activities, military men will exert their strength on his behalf, newspapers and magazines will promote him, politicians and party members will connect him with various parties, and bureaucrats will support him. In an instant, the entire machinery will be mobilized. But all efforts cannot match the guns of young military officers because their guns have assassinated financial tycoons Junnosuke Inoue and Takuma Dan, stained Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi and Inukai Tsuyoshi's official residence with blood, and started an incident in Tokyo, killing Takahashi Korekiyo, Saito Makoto, Watanabe Jotaro, etc. This cannot but cause people to worry. Therefore, no matter how great Ugaki's influence is, he cannot always get his way.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the elder statesman Saionji and the group of senior statesmen valued Ugaki. Now, for the sake of clarity, the main figures from various circles associated with Ugaki are listed below:</p>
<p>Military side: Jiro Minami, Harushige Nomiya, Juichi Terauchi, Nobuyuki Abe, Hajime Sugiyama.</p>
<p>Political parties: Belonging to the Minseito party are Katsuki Kawasaki, Kojiro Tomita, Kyoichi Yamamichi, Jusho Koyama, Sachio Sakurauchi, Hideo Ikeda, Ryutaro Nagai, Kozo Makiyama, Fujimi Suzuki, Nagahisa Shimizu, Keikichi Yorita, etc. Belonging to the Seiyukai party are Shigemasa Sunada, Ichiro Kono, Tadahiko Okada, Ichiro Hoshijima, Teiichiro Yamamoto, Ichiro Hatoyama, etc. Belonging to the Social Masses Party are Kyu Ma, Kantaro Kamei; current independents such as Keisuke Mochizuki, Kiyoshi Akita, Mishen Koizumi, etc.</p>
<p>House of Peers: Nobumitsu Aoki, Naosuke Mizoguchi, Tadatoku Ishiguro, Yorina Arima from the Research Society; Takio Izawa, Iin Otokoyo, Daijiro Tagawa, Manabu Matsuki from the bureaucrat faction; and Fusajiro Abe, etc.</p>
<p>Financial circles: The main sources of political funds for Ugaki are the Kansai financial groups, including Masatsune Ogura of Sumitomo, Katsutaro Inayane of Nezu, Yatsukichi Ataka, Fusajiro Abe of the Toyo Spinning system, Bannan Atta, Kotaro Kato of the Kansai Trust system; Jun Noguchi of the Korean financial group; Kyohei Magoshi, Sunzaburo Ohara, Shinichiro Okazaki, Waichiro Hattori, Renzo Fujita, Kunizo Ozaki, etc. from the Okayama financial group; and figures from the Mitsubishi and Yasukawa groups.</p>
<p>As for the press, almost all those related to financial groups and political parties support Ugaki, so there is no need to elaborate.</p>
<p>Although Ugaki possesses such a vast amount of power, he still could not organize a cabinet as he wished. This clearly demonstrates the abnormal political state of the rampant young officers in the Japanese military. In the past, Japan's external wars could unify the country internally, but now Japan's external war is promoting internal divisions. The news of Ugaki's assassination, although unconfirmed, if true, Japan's political division in this war of aggression against us will inevitably come unexpectedly early. Under military actions, Japan may have a temporary possibility of military dictatorship, but the result will only accelerate the collapse of the military clique's power.</p>
<h3>The Magnificent Proposal of the "Laozi Army"</h3>
<p>— Hu Junfu</p>
<p>As the brave soldiers at the front lines fight bloody battles to kill the enemy, an aging man sits in his study, knitting his brows and writing poetry. How shameful! How sinful! Recently, I heard about Mr. Zhang Yichu's proposal for a "Laozi Army," how magnificent! Therefore, I compose three poems.</p>
<p>Precisely when the sky is collapsing and the earth is sinking, stifling voices and singing laments is foolish and stubborn. Brave sons can wash away shame by serving the country, and old fathers still deeply cherish the thought of a grand past.</p>
<p>Strive together to wield the sun-chasing spears, we shall certainly reorganize the old mountains and rivers. Supporting the frail and returning youth, uniting hearts and strength, such a spirit will never be worn down!</p>
<p>The difficult situation is unprecedented in ancient times, and the resourceful and extraordinary figures are also unique. Generally, they are all Arhats, having experienced hundreds of millions of great calamities.</p>
