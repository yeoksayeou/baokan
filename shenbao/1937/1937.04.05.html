<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀中國銀行二十五年度業務報告</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>二十五年度中國銀行業務報告書。昨已發表。關於此一年中工商金融情形。該報告書列舉貨幣管理之益見集中。外匯之異常穩定。物價之顯著回漲。工商業之復興。以及國外貿易之改善等諸點。並謂“此類良好結果。固可歸功於去歲之豐收。而益見新貨幣制度推行之初。國內外種種疑慮。未免過分矣。……今日管理幣制之成功。要在國人對於管理當局之意旨及能力加以信仰。倘無此信仰。縱使幣制當局具有巨額準備。亦難維持幣制之穩定。”其言至當。蓋任何事業之得以成功。皆惟“能力”與“信用”是賴。經濟市場縱可藉他種因素。獲得一時之興奮。而其基礎之能否穩定。要仍繫於一般購買力之強弱。去年經濟狀況好轉之原因。僅就國內而言。自當以各地豐收為第一。而其次則在幣制改革後國人對於諸領袖銀行之信任。然而此非偶然也。</p>
<p>茲請以中國銀行為例。中國銀行能有今日之地位。固因其經理得人。措置咸宜。而過去不受袁世凱之亂命。實為信用深入人心之一大原因。自此而後。國人咸知中國銀行能不畏強禦。而惟存戶及持券人之利益是謀。願舉其素日對於外國銀行之信任。移轉於中國銀行。故近年時局屢有變動。而中國銀行則以變動反益顯其業務之進展。觀於本屆報告。法幣發行額。中國銀行竟占其百分之四二·七九之絕對多數。存欵總額則自二十四年之七億六千六百萬元一躍而至二十五年之九億七千八百萬元儲蓄存欵甫於二十四年五月間開辦是年年終已有四千三百一十萬元。至二十五年末幾增加一倍而為八千五百六十萬元以上數端。足為一般人信任中國銀行之明證。然而吾人尚望該行此後能善保其信用長為中國社會經濟作屏藩也。</p>
<p>再就中國銀行今後業務言之。該行在中央儲備銀行未正式成立前。仍分負中央儲備銀行所應負之職責。但據報告書云“一俟此過渡時代結束之後各領袖銀行之機能將愈能劃分清楚各行當能按照條例所規定聚精會神於本身范圍內金融業務之發展。”吾人深知各領袖銀行機能之明確劃分。乃鞏固中國金融基礎之必要條件。惟切望報告書上所云。能早日實現而已。</p>
<h3>日本藏相宣稱不望新黨出現</h3>
<p>但希望政黨能改過自新　政友會對政府態度硬化</p>
<p>⊙宇治山田　結城藏相與津島日銀副總裁同謁伊勢神宮、報告履新、已於四日午前九時行抵宇治山田車站、此次在西下車中語人如左、㊀選舉問題、此次解散議會之理由、在要求政黨之改革與反省、並非因政策不同、故政府亦未期待出現新黨、以作今後之與黨、倘總選之議員、改善其質、則議會無論如何分野均可、㊁匯兌問題、為防止匯兌率、因不可避免之入超增加、而趨惡化起見、今後當在新產金之范圍以內、仍須適宜運出現金、以便努力維持匯兌之水準、七月以降之輸入匯兌許可制度、是否撤銷、尚須觀察情勢、現在未便談論、又市上匯兌銀行等亦希望修正、其他當業情形等節亦復不少、凡僅圖利己者、均須排斥之、例如紡績公司、向華北進展、而其資本之匯兌、輒謂因輸入許可制、而感困難云云、請求設法緩和、此乃紡績公司僅以本身利益為目標者、現遲未許可、對於此事、大藏省與紡績聯合會、均在調查中云云、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］民政黨連日在本部召開選舉委員會、關於銓衡繼任候補人以及選舉對策、業已着手辦理、最近尤堪注目者、即黨內之對政府態度、漸次硬化、其主張大致如左、吾黨之對政府態度、原屬微溫、政府既藐視政黨、而採取其極非立憲之態度、無理解散、吾人對此、當然應在確立憲政凈化政界行使刷新之大旆下、堂堂與政府宣戰、但事前須與政友會取得協調、若能發表共同聲明、更當使兩黨之對政府態度、成為明確者也云、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］“星報”今晚登載一社評、題曰“十字街頭之日本”略謂“日本軍部與政黨、因互爭雄長而相角逐、亦已久矣、此次衆議院解散、舉行改選、實使此種政治鬥爭、進入一新階段、查日本首相林銑士郎、於解散衆院之後、即下令於本月杪舉行總選舉、可見渠尚有所顧忌、而不欲將民治制度之最後殘跡、悉加毀滅也”、該報繼復謂、日本現已產生一新政黨、該黨公然宣佈、以實行法西斯政治為其目的、總之、日本自明治維新七十年以來、民治思想根底是否穩固、要當於此次選舉中有所證明矣云、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日物價暴漲如何制止</h3>
<p>日本銀行總裁　以為方法甚多</p>
<p>［東京］因實行大預算、而使物價暴漲、如何制止、乃為日本財政經濟上最為重視之問題、今後實行物價對策之中心機關、即日本銀行總裁池田是也、該總裁於四日對於物價問題、談話如左、抑制物價昂貴之方法甚多、但結局為擴大生產力、此事在我國現狀上言之、當為最善之方法、增加生產力物資之供給豐富、則消減疑惑、即可抑制物價之暴騰、觀夫德國之實例、亦可明瞭、但為擴充生產力起見、而供給產業資金、則其過渡時期物價、急趨暴騰、此種傾向、在所難免、至於如何處理、吾人非大加考慮不可、至於供給產業資金、亦須念及反動時期之到達、及其他各種情形、又如對於若何事業、方可給與資金、亦非考慮不可、在此項意義之下、當有統制之必要也云云、（四日同盟社電）</p>

<h3>南遊鱗爪（四）</h3>
<p>— 君寶</p>
<p>多年以前，安南和平地方，發見一種石器，與在暹羅．馬來亞•爪哇•及其他南洋羣島所發見者相同。足證遠古有同一民族廣播於安南暹羅•馬來亞•南洋羣島新幾內亞各地。荷蘭地質教授賈蘭弗callenfels氏，曾在中爪哇發見四萬年前冰河時代之人類頭骨十一個，並在同一地方掘出人類兵器及牛，海馬骨骼等件。此種發見，震動世界，南洋羣島，遂為人類學者視線集中之處。美國干爾基公司，以－萬八千元美金與新加披萊佛士博物館，作發掘馬來亞民族文化津貼金，指定一九三四至一九三六年支用。馬來亞古代民族骨骼發掘工作，遂於一九二四年開始，由賈蘭氏領導，先在檳榔嶼屬威利斯省掘出數千年人骨及古代石器，與在安南和平所發見者相同。去歲太平博物館考古家在和平順園石岩內發見古代人骨數具，並在和平山洞，獲得比前更古人類骸骨一副，洗刷後，面孔·上下顎骨•牙齒•等一一顯明。考古家認係屬於Austronesian種族，（馬來族）遠在四千五百年前，移居此間，比石器時代為古。現賈氏發掘工作，巳經完成，將各處所獲，運至新加坡博物館陳列，一方面草就詳細報告，不久即可發表。萊佛士博物館特闢一室，陳列發掘所得古代文化證物，供專鬥家研究，此種南洋古代文化，既具一種特別體系，研究此種文化者，因以一概括名詞“和平文化”名之，以此種古代文化，首在安南和平地方發見。故馬來人種的起原，定將由此得着新的證明了。</p>
<p>自十六世紀初，西·舊·諸國人航海東來，開闢殖民地，荷蘭人以及英法各國的人，相繼接踵而至，鯨吞蠶食的便把整個南洋各島，豆剖瓜分，全變成白色人種的殖民地。虎入羊羣，擇肥而噬，從此東方有色人種，變作孤城落日，澌滅陵夷，不易悻存，馬來民族更是首當其衝。</p>
<p>一般自命文明人類而富於傳統思想的學者們，對世界各地未開化或半開化的人類，都認作是劣等的民族，不能與文明人類等量齊觀。人類不平等觀念，根深蒂固，牢不可破，這不過是自私自利的慾念作祟。因此所謂文明人類來支配野蠻人類，壓榨殘殺，都是分所應然，不會有人非議或干涉的。</p>
<p>世界未開化或半開化人類，滯留在原始時代生活而不進化原因，無非是居處的環境使然：如惡劣的氣候，使人不能不振作·交通阻隔，不受外界激刺：生活需要簡單，易於獲取，競爭不烈的種種因素。</p>
<p>南洋羣島的馬來人種，决不像一般學者所預期的那樣低劣，自外來人種侵入後，環境更大改觀，所受之激剌薰陶，已十分深刻，最重大的刺激，就是經濟上的壓迫，前數年，蘇島馬來人國民黨大會宣言說：荷印是東印度人的東印度，荷人侵略占領後，施以不平等待遇，每一苦工，每年只給工資八盾，貧富平均每人每日生活費只有八仙，目前經濟恐慌，每人只有三仙，無論如何，必須獨立自主。故其進步甚速，一日千里，早與世界文化人類相抗衡，揚眉吐氣了</p>
<p>自十九世紀到二十世紀東方民族，已開始與西方民族爭平等，日本民族的崛起，和中華民族的革命推進，固不必論，即馬來民族的獨立自主運動，亦已放一異彩，如菲律賓的獨立，開始於一八九０年反抗西班牙政府及美人占領菲律賓後，菲律賓民族的反美運動，繼續奮鬥，卒使菲律賓的獨立，得獲勝利。荷屬東印度羣島的馬來人，追逐菲律賓的後塵，獨立運動，也風起云涌，荷人用懷柔高壓雙管齊下政策，他們統治方式，也以變不少，如一九一七年設立民會，一九二五年擴大東印度自治權，自是馬來人也有代議土出現於殖民地政府的自治會議場中。然而在比較前進的馬來人，尚不因此種覊糜而自足的。繼起要求解放，仍不少衰，他們所組織的政黨，有印度黨·回教黨·統一黨·國民黨·等等的名稱。前菲總統奎松氏就職時，東印度統一黨領袖覃林氏，致電馳賀，殆隱然以東印度的奎松自居，不過荷屬人對待激進政黨，不惜用高壓手段，使他不能存在，方始放心，現在荷印政府，政治上最感煩苦的事，就要算對待馬來人獨立自主運動了，馬來民族的曙光，漸放光明，終有如日中天的時候，馬來民族正在覺醒過程中，馬來民族是最會享樂而不長進的民族的觀念，應該加以改正了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>教科書減價間題</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>教科書減價問題，是頗值得商量的。因為這一問題，關係於普及教育，殊為重大，未可忽視。教部前曾飭令各書局，將教科書定價核減。書業公會以紙張原料上漲，不能照辦。對於此事，前日市教會列舉教科書應減價理由，籲請各書局實行減價。翌日書業公會又申述不能減價理由，對教育會所陳各點，加以答辯。以此看來，書業方面，不願减低教科書定價，是很顯然的。</p>
<p>教科書定價，應以最廉價格發售，這理由是簡單的。一，教科書為普及教育的工具，非以廉價出售，不能普及。二，教科書須定價低廉，以減輕學生的教育费，使一般人易於就學。三，教科書銷路甚大，廉價發售，仍有厚利可得。四，書業負有促進教育的使命，對於教科書，尤應特别克己。</p>
<p>然而教科書在書業方面，每視為“奇貨”。這只須一看各書局的爭發教科書，及過去競爭的情形，即可明白。教部飭令各書局，將教科書定價核減，此舉殊善，各書局若能顧及我國教育前途，應立刻遵辦才是。但書業公會，以紙張原料上漲為理由，不願實行減價，這未免使人失望。</p>
<p>教科書能不能減價，須視成本為轉移。教科書的成本多少，非外行人所得明白。據市教育會的計算。世界初小國語第三冊，僅一分八厘，商務初中國語第三冊，僅一角二分七厘。而前者定價六分，后者定價九角，可見獲利是頗厚的。即依書業方面所說，此不過為一部份成本而已，還有其他費用。今假定前者成本為三分，後者成本為三角，與售價相差尚遠，再減低一些，想是可以的。</p>
<p>“屬會以為同業必須先謀維持生存，方能對教育有所貢獻”，這話自然是不錯的。呌各書局犧牲血本，來推銷教科書，無論誰都不願意。然而另一方面，將“生意眼”全放在教科書上，怕也是不該的。試問各書局的發行教科書，抱着怎樣的態度？為教育而服務的成分多，還是為賺錢的成分多？</p>
<p>故教科書減價問題，在不虧本的原則下，還是希望書業能多少減一些。這對於各書局，或不免有若干影響。但對於普及教育，便有很大利益。即撇開大問題不講，近來一般學生家庭，子女教育費負擔極重，各書局若能將教科書定價，實行核減，這在求學者，真是受惠不淺。</p>
<h3>歸鄉拾記</h3>
<p>— 劉子明</p>
<p>回到鄉下的第二天，遠近親戚都到我家來，他們似乎都很高興我每年在清明先後回鄉来一趟。故鄉把掃墓看做最重要的事。我是個獨生子，父母死亡之後就孑然一身飄落在外面，而每年在清明先後所以要回去一趟的理由，恐怕自己都不明白。一個終年飄流在外面的年青人，對於家的懷戀自然縈繞在心頭，不過為什么一定要在這時候回去呢？要博得那些親戚們的高興嗎？當然不是的，不過誰在督促着我：“要回去一趟！”其實故鄉的春天，已不再是羣鶯亂飛的時候了。</p>
<p>姑丈告訴我：看墳人去年來說過，祖墳上的竹籬已做了野狗的巢了，種植着的松柏被漁船上的孩子砍去做柴燒了……他雖然沒有說出要我馬上去看一看墳，但是那是子孫應該做的事，我向他道謝了照拂的盛意，下一天即雇了船上墳去。</p>
<p>那舟子是我家從前的長工。現在他租了一艘馬頭船過水上生活了，他的家就是船，船就是他的家。清明是最出生意的時節，他另外雇佣了一個幫手，據說靠一春的生意也堪維持他簡單的生活了。船開出了池河，恰遇順風，於是張了帆，讓那幫手在船尾把着舵，他鑽進艙裏來和我扯談了。</p>
<p>他還像在我家做長工的時候－樣，喜歡渴酒，喜歡講笑話，祇是額上網佈了生活的皺紋，兩鬢染着蒼白短髮，或許身材也變從前瘦削一些。爬進艙來，他先笑了起來，那種莫來由的善意也祇有拋了書報了他一個微笑。他量平了船的重量，一屁股坐在我的對面，用粗大的手背擦着他的厚嘴唇，一面從腰囊裏掏出一偶酒瓶來，揭了瓶塞，仰起𩓐子灌了两口，又用手背擦着嘴唇，才開口說：“阿官，還記得罵我酒鬼的時候？”</p>
<p>我小時候常缠住他讲故事，但是那股直冲的酒臭委实難聞，其他的孩子們也常常罵他酒鬼的。現在我對他祇有微笑，因為我知道他的老婆就是喝酒喝掉的。提起酒，或許要勾引起那老實人的悲哀的。但是他却自己說了：</p>
<p>“阿官，喝酒喝掉一個老婆，恐怕祇有我阿二了。那臭婆娘現在不知道在那個倒霉鬼身上賣騷。阿官，記得嗎？就是楊老爺家的小丫頭。”</p>
<p>我點點頭。那小丫頭被他弄上手的時候也是抄了小路的，楊老爺為了多一事不如少一事，就糊裏糊涂送給了阿二，但終究落了空。</p>
<p>“現在就單身過著嗎？”我問他，“楊老爺家恐怕也沒有第二個小丫頭了。”</p>
<p>“阿官，不要取笑，他灌了口酒，手背擦着嘴唇，彷彿這舉動無論如何分不開似的，”“一個人過活不是寫意得多嗎，老婆簡直是腳鐐，絆住你走不開一步路，一走開，就飛了……”</p>
<p>搖搖頭，又喝酒，擦嘴唇，或許他有着更多的牢騷不能用言語表示吧。而我這個常常坐在他膝蓋上剝毛荳莢的阿官現在對他那樣落落無語。</p>
<p>順風裏行船，祇一半時間到了。在收港的時候，阿二鑽出艙去收了帆。船靠岸，他第一個跳上去繫了纜，就高聲對墳屋里喊那看墳的老頭。我在船艙裏向外望去，簡直已認不清那一個是我家的墳墓了。記得祖父下葬的時候，從岸邊到墳的甬道上搭着廠棚，墳墓上剛挑了新土，四圍的松柏像大傘似的蓋着，那是堪與先生所覓得的好風水。那老頭兒從墳屋裏出來了，看他蹌跟的樣子，他和漁船上的孩子們鬥勁，和我們向生活搏鬥不是一樣地失敗嗎？</p>
<h3>賽金花（十二）</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>義和團的騷動，終于觸怒了帝國主義。中國在列強的眼中，是最好的“殖民地。”他們的侵略怒焰，怎能息滅呢？他們聯合着八國的軍隊，向中國大肆殘殺了！</p>
<p>老頭兒向我嘆息着他太不中用了，很歉仄地低着頭，我反而安慰他，另外給了他一點錢，吩咐他把竹籬結結好。我不想藉風水結我什么幫助，但是祖宗的墳墓做着野狗的窠，也將於心無安吧。</p>
<p>酒阿二大概喝多了酒，用最高的聲音和老頭談着：“阿官將來發了財，還要大大的造墳屋，祖宗福氣好，你老頭也佔着光呢。”</p>
<p>我想問他又想着逃掉的老婆？一個過了中年的人他不會不想到將來的歸宿的，他的老婆逃了，自然還沒有一個兒子，醉話見真心，那老賓人的悲痛或者更甚於我嗎？那句話冲到口頭，終於咽住了，喚他早些打回，到鎮上請他喝一斤白乾。</p>
<h3>外國人的迷信談</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>我們常聽人說道：“當今科學昌明，應打倒一切迷信。又有人說：“中國人迷信最多。其實中國人固然好迷信，外國人亦何嘗不好迷信呢？在靠着墻壁間的梯子下走過，外國人認為要觸霉頭的，鼎鼎大名的科學家愛因斯坦，有一次寧願踏水而過，却不願在梯子下經過，可見科學有時還敵不過迷信啊。</p>
<p>迷信的種類很多，一種是相信未來事情的吉兆或兇兆。中外人很多相信夢兆是很靈驗的。現在把外國人的夢話說一兩件：倘若夢見拔去一個牙齒，流了許多血，那是兇兆，要防親屬害病，甚至要嗚呼哀哉。夢見自己身上失去什麼，流了許多血，那也是兇兆。倘若拔牙沒有血，雖是不吉，却跟你親屬無關，不過要防遭遇小禍，可不必多憂愁。夢見死人，有許多關係。倘若那死人跑一個活着的人同行，防備要遇喪事。倘若那死人拿些食物或別的東西給一個活着的人，受物的人可遇吉事。倘若病中夢見死人給他什麼東西，那是不日便能痊愈的豫兆。有些迷信不深的人，却也相信夢是未來事情的預兆，他們說夢是睡着中的潛意識的腦經作用，未來的事情，確能預先映在腦裹，不過愚人一時不能察覺罷了。</p>
<p>有些偶爾遇到的小事，也可以當作一種豫兆。倘若進餐的時候，無意中把監灑在桌上，同桌的人必要不樂，因為那是口角的預兆。倘若兩個已經訂婚的人，雨天一同散步，在路上遇見一輛汽車駛過，把泥水濺在滿身，在常人一定要罵那司機人，但是未來的夫婦遇到這種事，並不以衣服被污為惜，還要滿心歡喜哩，因為那是甘苦相共，團結到老的一個預兆。倘若一對未來夫婦走在路上，要越過馬路，恰巧有一棵樹在面前，一個由樹的左面走過，一個由樹的右面走過，那是要切忌的，趕緊縮回，在同一方面走過，否則恐怕好事多磨，不久便要鴛鴦分拆了。</p>
<p>女學校的學生，也有許多迷信，倘若兩個人同時說起同一件事情，那是一個絕好的機會，趕快把小指相繞，祝你心上的所願，保可使話的願望不久必可實現。小姐們對於本人婚姻大事，倘若有些動情，可向她已訂婚的朋友借用訂婚的戒指，套在自己的戴訂婚戒指的手指上一兩分鐘，在這個當兒，把那戒指轉三次，口中默祝你的心頭所願，那末，在三個月內保你姻緣巧合，得到終身的伴侶。或在在新月初升皎潔的夜裏，對着月兒默祝，那月兒自己雖是處女，跟異性没有什麽關係，但是她很願成全人的好事，使你逹到願望，</p>
<p>談到迷信，决不是短短的篇幅可以說得盡的。時代愈古，迷信愈多，中華本是一個古國，自然迷信之事，隨處都有，不過在二十世紀以前，倘若談在迷信，人人都相信而不以為羞的，今日呢，一般自以為智識高出老太婆的人們，便要斥為頑固了。</p>
<p>可是有一件事切勿忘記。莎翁集上曾說過羅馬大帝凱撒當被刺的那夜，倘若聽了他夫人的警告，也許不會遭那場橫禍。凱撒不是一位很堅决的丈夫麼？他恥笑他夫人的迷信，却得到什麼結果呢？（譯自英文大美晚報）</p>

<p>[Xi'an] Text of the Central Executive Committee's Memorial to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum: "On the occasion of the National Tomb Sweeping Day, April 4th, the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in remembrance of the achievements of our ancestors, desires to enlighten those who come to understand their heritage and to revitalize the spirit of our nation. We specially dispatch members Zhang Ji and Gu Zhutong to travel to the mausoleum to represent us in paying tribute to the tomb of our founding ancestor, the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, saying: 'Looking back to the distant past, the world was in a primitive state, heaven created the earth, and the people lacked laws and regulations. It was our Yellow Emperor who received the mandate of heaven, founded the nation, and established the foundation, leading the people. He initiated systems and rules, regulated all industries, and the feudal lords relied on his influence and all became his followers. He established calendars to record time, created characters to record events, built palaces and clothing, and created a wealth of cultural artifacts. The wicked Chiyou, who dared to resist, caused chaos. He resolutely punished the disobedient, establishing a permanent distinction between the Chinese and barbarians. We admire his achievements, which have spread to all regions, and he has blessed and inspired future generations to expand and promote them. In pursuit of his legacy, our people have never slackened, protecting our people, relying on the spirits of our ancestors. Remembering the dew of spring, the sacrificial ceremonies are completed, and we present these offerings to invite you to come and enjoy. Respectfully presented.'" (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Xi'an] Text of the Nationalist Government's Memorial to the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum: "In the 26th year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, Chairman of the Nationalist Government, specially dispatches Sun Weiruo, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, to respectfully present incense, wine, and humble offerings to the Bridge Mausoleum. The text reads: 'O Emperor, your wisdom encompasses all things, and your grace extends to the entire world. You lifted the masses from suffering and secured the foundation of the nation. You mobilized troops in Zhuolu to conquer the feudal lords, and unified the wilderness. You quelled chaos with weapons and created peace with systems. Your great virtue and far-reaching plans are still relied upon today. Today, on this auspicious day of Qingming, we renew the ancient rituals of sacrifice. The mausoleum is lush and green, as if we are beholding the majesty of your bow and sword. The torches are bright, as if we are hearing the elegant music of Yunmen. We hope that your spirit in heaven will observe our sincerity, silently enlighten our people, and unite our hearts and minds, turning disasters into blessings and advancing the world towards longevity. We earnestly rely on your great favor to accomplish great achievements. We have prepared the rituals with purity and sincerity, and humbly beseech your acceptance.'" (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Kong and Others Pass Through Hong Kong En Route to the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Auxiliary Secretary and Various Sectors Welcomed Them at the Port; He Dong and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Held Banquets to Entertain Them</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Kong Xiangxi, Chen Shaokuan, and a group of more than thirty people arrived in Hong Kong on the Victoria at 10:00 AM on the 4th. The Hong Kong Auxiliary Secretary Shi Mei and members of the business community, as well as provincial representatives Zeng Yangfu, Liu Weichi, Zou Minchu, and others, numbering several hundred, disembarked to welcome them. Kong sent Yang Guangsheng to meet with reporters and stated that after attending the coronation of the British monarch in England, Kong visited various European countries for inspection and then returned to China via the Americas. Kong went ashore and went directly to the Governor's Office to pay his respects to the Governor of Hong Kong. The Governor, being ill, sent Shi Mei to represent him in receiving them. After Kong left, he went to He Dong's banquet and said in his speech that after the opening of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, transportation between Hong Kong and various parts of China has become more convenient, and the relations between China and Britain have become closer. This delegation's visit to England will promote cooperation between the two countries. At 4:00 PM, Kong went to the Sze Hoi Hotel for a welcome meeting organized by forty-two overseas Chinese organizations and gave a speech. He said that Sino-British relations are increasingly harmonious, and the friendship between the two great nations is growing closer. Hong Kong is the hub of Sino-British trade, and he hopes that overseas Chinese will continue to maintain Sino-British amity. At 4:30 PM, Kong went to the banquet held by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, encouraging Chinese businessmen to promote and expand Sino-British trade. Chen Shaokuan went to the Great Hotel at 1:00 PM for a banquet hosted by British Naval Commander Li Du. Kong and Chen returned to the ship at 6:00 PM and departed west at 8:00 PM.

<p>[Hong Kong] Special Envoy Kong and his party, after attending the reception hosted by the local General Chamber of Commerce at 5:00 PM on the 4th, boarded their original ship at 8:00 PM in the evening to go to Manila. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy specially sent by our country to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the British King George VI, arrived in Hong Kong at 10:00 AM today (the 4th). There were many welcomers at the pier. Hong Kong Governor Hotung, due to illness, was recuperating in the countryside, and was represented by Secretary Smith to welcome him at the pier. Smith expressed to Special Envoy Kong that the Governor felt very sorry for not being able to come in person to welcome him due to his illness. The Governor also provided his car and boat for the use of Special Envoy Kong. Smith, on behalf of the Governor, invited Special Envoy Kong and Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan to the Governor's Office for a short rest, and Smith accompanied them. Sir He Dong hosted a banquet for Special Envoy Kong at his magnificent private residence on the summit, with more than one hundred prominent figures from all walks of life in Hong Kong participating in the banquet. Mayor Zeng Yangfu of Guangzhou also participated in the banquet. During the banquet, Sir He Dong proposed a toast to the prosperity of the Republic of China, and Special Envoy Kong then suggested a toast to the health of the British monarch.

Sir He Dong then continued to talk about the cooperation between China and Britain in the reform of the Chinese monetary system, and expressed his hope that Kong would go to various places for inspection after attending the coronation ceremony, which would be beneficial to the country. Special Envoy Kong then gave a reply speech, which was simple but very moving. Kong first expressed his gratitude for the host's hospitality, and thanked all the guests present. He then stated the purpose of this trip, which was purely to attend the British monarch's coronation ceremony, but he would take the opportunity in Europe to investigate the economic, industrial, and progress situations in various European countries, and solemnly stated that Hong Kong and Guangdong and other parts of China are geographically close, and economically and commercially close. The majority of the population of British colonies are Chinese immigrants, so Hong Kong is the link between Sino-British friendly relations. The completion of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway has made transportation more convenient, which is of great benefit to trade between China and Hong Kong. The Chinese government's dispatch of me to lead a special envoy delegation to attend the British monarch's coronation ceremony proves the Chinese government's special emphasis on the friendship between China and Britain. This trip by the special envoy delegation will further strengthen the cooperation and friendly relations between the people of China and Britain. Kong's speech was frequently interrupted by applause.

<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways issued a notice regarding the reorganization of the Hukuang Railway Loan. The outstanding amount of the Hukuang Railway Loan of 1911 is approximately £5,650,000 in British currency. A reorganization plan has been drafted to reduce the interest rate payable in the 26th and 27th years of the Republic of China and to revise the redemption method. Other provisions in the loan contract will remain unchanged. The articles of this reorganization plan are as follows: ㊀ The interest for the years 26 and 27 of the Republic of China will be paid at a rate of 2.5% per week, and thereafter at a rate of 5%. The interest will be paid from the net surplus of the railway and guaranteed by the salt tax. From January 1, 30th year of the Republic of China, subsequent interest payments will be guaranteed by customs duties, with the order of precedence calculated from the date of this notice. ㊁ Redemption of principal will commence in the 30th year of the Republic of China, calculated from the 26th year, and will be completed within 39 years, according to the redemption schedule issued to the managing banks. The redemption of principal and interest, and the payment of the receipts issued according to Article 3 of this plan, will be made from the net surplus of the railway. Any shortfall will be supplemented by the Ministry of Finance from tax revenues. The government may, with appropriate notice, increase the amount of redemption at any redemption date without additional cost. Bonds that have been drawn but not redeemed shall be redeemed in the order in which they were drawn. ㊂ Accrued interest will be changed from the original 5% to 1% per week simple interest and paid in the form of non-interest-bearing receipts. The interest underpaid during the 26th and 27th years will also be paid at one-fifth of the value in the form of non-interest-bearing receipts. These receipts will be redeemed starting in the 31st year of the Republic of China and will be cleared within approximately 20 years. The amount paid each year should be roughly equal, except that the government may reserve the right to transfer up to 50% of the amount payable in the first three years to the last two years. ㊃ The reorganization plan should be separately ordered to the Inspector General of Customs, the Chief Inspectorate of Salt Revenue, the Central Bank, and the Railway Administration for compliance. It is further stated that the railway authorities are currently seeking to rectify railway administration and improve management in accordance with the purpose of the loan contract, so that the government and bondholders may benefit together.

<h3>Reading the 25th Annual Business Report of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The 25th Annual Business Report of the Bank of China was released yesterday. Regarding the industrial, commercial, and financial situation during this year, the report lists the increasing concentration of currency management, the abnormal stability of foreign exchange, the significant rebound in prices, the revival of industry and commerce, and the improvement of foreign trade. It also states, "These positive results can be attributed to last year's bumper harvests, but also show that the initial domestic and international concerns about the implementation of the new currency system were somewhat excessive... Today, the success of managing the currency system depends on the people's belief in the intentions and capabilities of the management authorities. Without this belief, even if the currency authorities have huge reserves, it will be difficult to maintain the stability of the currency system." This statement is accurate. The success of any undertaking depends on "ability" and "credit." Economic markets may be temporarily stimulated by other factors, but the stability of their foundation still depends on the strength of general purchasing power. In terms of domestic reasons only, the most important reason for the improvement in the economic situation last year was the good harvest in various places, followed by the trust of the people in the leading banks after the currency reform. However, this was not accidental.</p>
<p>Taking the Bank of China as an example, the Bank of China has achieved its current position not only because of its capable managers and appropriate measures, but also because its refusal to obey Yuan Shikai's illegal orders was a major reason for its deeply ingrained credit. Since then, the people of the country have known that the Bank of China can withstand the powerful and only seek the interests of depositors and bondholders. They are willing to transfer the trust they used to have in foreign banks to the Bank of China. Therefore, in recent years, the situation has changed repeatedly, and the Bank of China has shown its progress in its business. According to this report, the Bank of China accounts for an absolute majority of 42.79% of the total legal tender issued. The total amount of deposits jumped from 766 million yuan in the 24th year to 978 million yuan in the 25th year. Savings deposits were only started in May of the 24th year, and by the end of the year, they had reached 43.1 million yuan. By the end of the 25th year, they had almost doubled to over 85.6 million yuan. These figures are clear proof of the general public's trust in the Bank of China. However, we still hope that the bank can continue to maintain its credit and serve as a long-term shield for China's social economy.</p>
<p>Regarding the Bank of China's future business, before the official establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, the bank will continue to share the responsibilities that the Central Reserve Bank should bear. However, according to the report, "Once this transition period is over, the functions of the leading banks will be more clearly defined, and each bank will be able to concentrate on the development of financial business within its own scope as stipulated in the regulations." We deeply know that the clear division of the functions of the leading banks is a necessary condition for consolidating China's financial foundation. However, we sincerely hope that what is said in the report can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Declares He Does Not Hope for the Emergence of New Parties</h3>
<p>But hopes that political parties can reform themselves. The Seiyukai's attitude towards the government hardens.</p>
<p>⊙Ujiyamada Finance Minister Yuki and Vice President of the Bank of Japan, Tsushima, visited the Ise Grand Shrine to report on their new appointments. They arrived at Ujiyamada Station at 9:00 AM on the 4th. During the stop in Ujiyamada, he said the following: ㊀ Regarding the election issue, the reason for dissolving the parliament this time is to demand the reform and reflection of political parties, not because of policy differences. Therefore, the government does not expect new parties to emerge to serve as its partner in the future. If the quality of the members elected in the general election improves, the parliament can be divided in any way. ㊁ Regarding the exchange rate issue, in order to prevent the exchange rate from deteriorating due to the inevitable increase in import surplus, we will continue to appropriately transport cash within the scope of new gold production to maintain the level of the exchange rate. Whether the import exchange permit system after July will be abolished remains to be seen and cannot be discussed now. In addition, exchange banks in the market also hope to revise the regulations, and there are many other business situations. All those who only seek self-interest must be rejected. For example, textile companies are developing in North China, but the exchange of their capital is said to be difficult due to the import permit system, and they request that the system be relaxed. This is because textile companies only aim at their own interests and have not yet been permitted. The Ministry of Finance and the Textile Federation are investigating this matter.

<p>[Tokyo] The Minseito Party has been holding election committees at its headquarters for several days to handle the selection of successor candidates and election countermeasures. What is particularly noteworthy recently is that the party's attitude towards the government is gradually hardening. Their claims are roughly as follows: Our party's attitude towards the government was originally lukewarm. Now that the government despises political parties and adopts an extremely unconstitutional attitude and unreasonable dissolution, we should of course declare war on the government under the banner of establishing constitutional government and purifying the political arena. However, we must coordinate with the Seiyukai beforehand, and if we can issue a joint statement, we should make the attitudes of the two parties towards the government clear. (4th Allied Press)</p>
<p>[London] "The Star" published an editorial tonight entitled "Japan at the Crossroads," which stated, "The Japanese military and political parties have been competing for supremacy for a long time. The dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of new elections have brought this political struggle into a new stage. After dissolving the House of Representatives, Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō ordered the general election to be held at the end of this month, which shows that he is still wary and does not want to destroy the last remnants of the civil administration system." The newspaper continued, "A new political party has emerged in Japan, which openly declares that its purpose is to implement fascist politics. In short, whether the foundation of civil administration thinking is solid in Japan since the Meiji Restoration seventy years ago will be proven in this election."

<h3>How to Curb the Soaring Prices in Japan</h3>
<p>Governor of the Bank of Japan believes there are many ways.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] How to curb the soaring prices caused by the implementation of the large budget is the most important issue in Japan's financial economy. The central agency for implementing price countermeasures in the future is the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Ikeda Shigeaki. The governor spoke about the price issue on the 4th as follows: There are many ways to suppress high prices, but the ultimate solution is to expand productivity. In our country's current situation, this should be the best way. Increasing productivity and the abundant supply of materials will reduce doubts and suppress soaring prices. The example of Germany can also be understood. However, in order to expand productivity and supply industrial funds, prices will inevitably tend to soar during the transition period. This tendency is inevitable. We must consider how to deal with it. Regarding the supply of industrial funds, we must also consider the arrival of the reaction period and other various situations. It is also necessary to consider which businesses can be given funds. Under this meaning, there must be a need for control. (4th Allied Press)</p>

<p>[New York] Philippine President Quezon delivered a speech at the Foreign Relations Research Society today, stating that the national defense of the Philippines can be made so strong that aggressors must suffer losses in life and property to the extent that they dare not try it lightly. Quezon absolutely denied that the Philippine national defense plan was designed to consolidate the authority of the United States in the Western Pacific. Quezon also said that he did not intend to use military procedures to militarize the Philippines, but only to create a peaceful army of the people, and that military training for young people would be modeled on that implemented in Switzerland, supplemented by a small number of technical units. Quezon further said that the increase in Philippine military preparations is in preparation for self-government. If it is said that it is intended to help the United States against Japan, it is not only baseless, but also has considerable malice. (3rd Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>[New York] The strike at the Ford assembly plant in Kansas City has now been resolved. According to the union, the strike was caused by Ford's disregard for the rights of those who have served for a long time and discrimination against union workers. Therefore, five senior officials of the company have flown from Detroit to Kansas City to investigate the truth of the strike. (4th Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[New York] The strike in the US automobile industry has not yet ended at this time. 60,000 workers at the Chrysler automobile plant in Detroit, Michigan, have been on strike for a month. Industrial Progress Association Chairman Lewis has now returned to Lansing from New York to hold negotiations with Chrysler factory owners in the hope of resolving the strike. Michigan Governor Murphy will also participate in these negotiations. In addition, the factory set up by General Motors in Flint City was occupied by striking workers. The factory accused the union of damaging the agreement signed with the company last month and criticized it. Therefore, the union leader in the city has ordered the striking workers to withdraw from the factory. In addition, a strike has also broken out at the Ford automobile factory. 14,000 workers at the Ford factory in Kansas City have stopped working entirely and occupied the factory until now because the factory dismissed 350 workers. As of now, the union has not ordered Ford factory workers to strike, but Automobile Union Chairman Martin has declared that Ford factory workers' wages are too low and working conditions need to be improved. In Washington, most members of Congress and senior administrative officials are now advocating a quick resolution to the strike.

<h3>Southern Travel Jottings (4)</h3>
<p>— Junbao</p>
<p>Many years ago, stone tools were discovered in the Hoa Binh region of Annam (present-day Vietnam), similar to those found in Siam (Thailand), Malaya, Java, and other islands in the South Seas. This is sufficient proof that in ancient times, the same ethnic group spread widely across Annam, Siam, Malaya, the South Seas islands, and New Guinea. The Dutch geology professor Callenfels discovered eleven human skulls from the Ice Age, 40,000 years ago, in central Java. He also unearthed human weapons and bones of cattle and seahorses at the same location. This discovery shook the world, and the South Seas islands became the focus of attention for anthropologists. The American Carnegie Corporation provided US$18,000 to the Raffles Museum in Singapore as a subsidy for the excavation of Malayan ethnic culture, designated for use from 1934 to 1936. The excavation of ancient Malayan ethnic skeletons began in 1924, led by Callenfels. He first excavated thousands-year-old human bones and ancient stone tools in the Province Wellesley of Penang, similar to those found in Hoa Binh, Annam. Last year, archaeologists from the Taiping Museum discovered several ancient human skeletons in the Sungei Siput rock shelter in Hoa Binh and obtained an even more ancient human skeleton in the Hoa Binh caves. After cleaning, the face, upper and lower jawbones, teeth, etc., became clearly visible. Archaeologists believe they belong to the Austronesian race (Malay race) who migrated here as early as 4,500 years ago, even earlier than the Stone Age. Currently, Callenfels' excavation work has been completed, and all the findings from various locations will be transported to the Singapore Museum for display. At the same time, a detailed report is being drafted and will be published soon. The Raffles Museum has specially opened a room to display the ancient cultural artifacts unearthed, providing resources for specialists to study. This ancient South Seas culture possesses a unique system, and those who study this culture have named it with a general term, "Hoa Binh culture," because this ancient culture was first discovered in the Hoa Binh region of Annam. Therefore, the origin of the Malay race will undoubtedly gain new evidence from this.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the sixteenth century, people from Western countries came east by sea, opening up colonies. The Dutch, as well as people from England and France, followed one after another. They devoured and fragmented the entire South Seas islands, turning them all into colonies of the white race. Like tigers entering a flock of sheep, they chose the fattest to devour. From then on, the colored people of the East became like a lonely city under the setting sun, declining and disappearing, with little chance of survival. The Malay ethnic group was the first to bear the brunt.</p>
<p>Scholars who pride themselves on being civilized humans and are rich in traditional ideas regard the uncivilized or semi-civilized humans in various parts of the world as inferior races, not to be equated with civilized humans. The concept of human inequality is deeply rooted and unbreakable; this is merely a result of selfish and self-serving desires. Therefore, it is natural for so-called civilized humans to dominate barbaric humans, to oppress and slaughter them, and no one will criticize or interfere.</p>
<p>The reason why uncivilized or semi-civilized humans in the world remain in the primitive age and do not evolve is simply due to their living environment: such as harsh climates, which force people to exert themselves; obstructed transportation, preventing external stimulation; and simple living needs, easy to obtain, and a lack of intense competition.</p>
<p>The Malay race of the South Seas islands is by no means as inferior as expected by general scholars. After the invasion of foreign races, the environment has greatly changed, and the stimulation and influence they have received has been profound. The most significant stimulus is economic oppression. Several years ago, the Congress of the Malay Nationalist Party of Sumatra declared: The Dutch East Indies is the East Indies of the East Indians. After the Dutch invaded and occupied it, they imposed unequal treatment. Each coolie receives only eight guilders per year in wages, and the average daily living expense per person is only eight cents. Currently, due to the economic panic, it is only three cents per person. In any case, they must be independent and autonomous. Therefore, their progress is very rapid, advancing a thousand miles a day, and they are already contending with the world's cultured humans, raising their eyebrows and breathing freely.</p>
<p>Since the nineteenth century to the twentieth century, Eastern nations have begun to fight for equality with Western nations. The rise of the Japanese nation and the revolutionary advancement of the Chinese nation need not be mentioned. Even the independence and autonomy movement of the Malay nation has shone with unique brilliance. For example, the independence of the Philippines began in 1890 with resistance against the Spanish government and the American occupation of the Philippines. The Philippine national anti-American movement continued to struggle, and finally the independence of the Philippines was victorious. The Malays of the Dutch East Indies are following in the footsteps of the Philippines. The independence movement is also surging. The Dutch are using a dual approach of appeasement and coercion. Their ruling methods have also changed considerably. For example, in 1917, they established a people's assembly, and in 1925, they expanded the autonomy of the East Indies. Since then, Malays have also had representative figures appearing in the autonomous conference halls of the colonial government. However, the more progressive Malays are not satisfied with this kind of superficial appeasement. The continued demand for liberation has not diminished. The political parties they have organized have names such as the Indian Party, the Islamic Party, the Unity Party, the Nationalist Party, etc. When former Philippine President Quezon took office, Tan Malaka, the leader of the East Indies Unity Party, sent a congratulatory telegram, almost positioning himself as the Quezon of the East Indies. However, the Dutch treat radical political parties with no hesitation in using coercive measures to prevent them from existing, only then can they rest assured. Currently, the most troublesome thing for the Dutch East Indies government in politics is dealing with the Malay independence and autonomy movement. The dawn of the Malay nation is gradually brightening, and there will eventually be a time when it is in its zenith. The Malay nation is in the process of awakening, and the idea that the Malay nation is a nation that enjoys pleasure and does not make progress should be corrected.</p>

<h3>Poland Pays Attention to German-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Situated Between Two Powers, Situation is Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw: Political figures here are paying close attention to the evolution of German-Soviet relations. Judging from the various psychological and economic signs recently, although the policies of Germany and the Soviet Union are currently incompatible and there is no room for compromise, it seems possible that they may change course and cooperate in the future. If this kind of cooperation is realized, Poland, situated between the two major powers, will inevitably feel fearful. This is especially unsettling for the Polish opposition. For example, the right-wing opposition newspaper Ateneum Weekly commented: "Germany's market for obtaining raw materials abroad is now only the Soviet Union. Germany wants to conquer the Soviet Union by force and seize its raw materials, which is currently difficult to do. Therefore, if Germany wants to obtain raw materials, it can only reach an understanding with the Soviet Union and promote trade between the two countries. Therefore, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union will one day change their current state. Some may think that the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union are so bad that cooperation is impossible, but this is not the case. Past facts prove that Germany once regarded Poland as its number one enemy, but after the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in 1934, Germany declared Poland as its friend. So, how can we be sure that Germany and the Soviet Union cannot reconcile one day?" In addition, right-wing figures believe that there is a possibility of rapprochement between Germany and the Soviet Union from a psychological perspective.

<p>###沧州缉私案日方提抗议</p>
<p>向冀省府提出四项要求　私货自津南下形成停顿</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication, March 12th Morning, the Cangzhou security team killed two Koreans and wounded one while suppressing smuggling. The Japanese Consulate General in Tianjin sent personnel to collect evidence and take photos regarding the case. Initially, they intended to protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but after consulting with the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, they received a reply stating that the case was a dishonorable matter and it would be difficult to formulate a protest letter.  It would be more appropriate to protest to the local authorities. After receiving the telegram, the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin studied it carefully and believed that protesting to the Cangxian government would be disrespectful because of its low rank, and they would not be an appropriate recipient of a protest.  Protesting to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was also deemed inappropriate because Cangxian was not under the council's direct jurisdiction.  Finally, at the end of March, they drafted a protest letter after careful consideration.  At 4:30 PM on the 1st of this month, Vice Consul Nishi Daichōkō was dispatched with the protest letter to visit Chen Dongsheng, the head of the Hebei Provincial Government's office in Tianjin, to deliver the letter and ask him to forward it to the provincial government.  On the morning of the 2nd, Nishi also took a copy of the protest to Beijing and delivered it to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council.  They were still unwilling to regard the Hebei Provincial Government as the sole party and bypass the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, lest we should underestimate the importance of the issue.  The main points of the protest are: ㊀ Severely punish the security team police who opened fire and killed people. ㊁ Replace Li Guojun, the magistrate of Cangxian, and the police chief of the county. ㊂ Provide generous compensation to the families of the dead and injured Koreans and compensate for the loss of goods. ㊃ Guarantee that such humiliating and anti-Japanese incidents will not occur again in the future. The original text concluded with a warning, urging the Hebei Provincial Government not to obscure the facts of the case, and warning that if such incidents were to occur again, the Japanese side would take decisive independent action. After receiving the protest, Chen Dongsheng telegraphed the provincial government to report the matter. The response of the provincial government will depend on Provincial Chairman Feng Zhi'an's instructions to Song Zheyuan. After the incident, the Cangxian government, in preparation for diplomatic procedures, took photos of the scene after the incident and voluntarily detained two security team police officers related to the case. When Onozaki, the Japanese police and judicial officer, went to Old Cangzhou to investigate on February 12th and 13th, County Magistrate Li Guojun argued with him based on the facts and kept a record of the conversation, which has been reported to the provincial government. The provincial government intends to have Chen Dongsheng negotiate locally in Tianjin if the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has no direct responsibility for negotiation, and to consult with Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong at any time in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Since the Cangxian incident, the smuggling of Ronin from Tianjin to the south has gradually come to an end. At the same time, the General Inspectorate of the Customs Road Transportation Anti-Smuggling Office has jointly suppressed and searched unscrupulous merchants inside and outside the city, and the market for smuggled goods is on the verge of decline. There are many smuggled goods piled up in Tianjin, and sales have been cut off, causing great panic among the Ronin. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Japanese government will use this dispute to expand the problem itself, making it serious, so that we will feel the suppression is difficult and abandon the current plan, so that the smuggling trend can be revived. Therefore, the resolution of this case is quite difficult.</p>
<p>One day early, a smuggling Ronin from the Japanese Concession in Tianjin loaded a heavy truck with 200 bags of smuggled sugar and transported it south along the Jinpu Road. When it arrived in Dezhou, it was intercepted by the Road Transportation Anti-Smuggling Office personnel. The Ronin showed the Jin Customs transportation certificate filled in for transportation to Henan, indicating that it had obtained permission from the Tianjin Customs, and relying on his barbarity, he tried to force his way through. After the inspector pointed out that the transportation direction was incorrect and that he was suspected of smuggling, he was detained. The Ronin then rushed back to Tianjin on the morning of the 2nd to report to the Japanese Consulate. The consulate believed that this was the customs deliberately making things difficult for legitimate Japanese merchants, and was preparing to protest to the customs within days. (Evening of the 2nd)</p>
<h3>闽省府召集地方财政会议</h3>
<p>积极建设地方事业　筹措资源整理税收</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication, Before the end of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, local unrest and chaos in Fujian province multiplied, and the local finances of various counties were chaotic, complex, and unverifiable. After the Fujian Incident was quelled, Chen Yi was ordered to preside over Fujian, and he urgently sought to reform all aspects of government, especially financial reform, which was a matter of utmost urgency. It is said that after the chaos, the people need rest and recuperation before they can talk about production. Without increased production, there is no way to enrich the tax base. Therefore, in the face of extremely difficult financial conditions, efforts were made to reorganize. Last year, more than 520 kinds of harsh and miscellaneous taxes were abolished, totaling more than 5 million yuan. Fourteen counties were exempted from land tax, totaling more than 2 million yuan. Other taxes such as tea, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, etc. were also repeatedly reduced. This year, the Xiamen fruit business tax was abolished, the Putian-Xianyou bamboo and wood tax was exempted, and the Zhangzhou export rice tax was abolished. At the same time, in order to accumulate and rectify the collection methods and eliminate long-standing abuses, revenue collection offices were set up in various counties to abolish redundant agencies. All provincial and county local taxes are collected together, and county treasuries are set up to exclusively manage provincial and county public funds and accounting affairs, so as to unify the revenue and expenditure of provincial and county funds, implement a new accounting system, formulate local accounting regulations in the province, seek to promote accounting independence, and establish a special business tax consolidation office to consolidate special business taxes. In Fujian Province, special business taxes, such as bamboo, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, oil, sugar, tea, seafood, wax, fertilizer, fruit, etc., are a major source of provincial revenue. In the past, due to shortfalls in treasury revenue, it was necessary to use contracted merchants to pay taxes in advance to subsidize the treasury. However, the contracting system had many abuses, and its complex organization and diverse names were generally criticized. Every additional collection agency means more harassment for merchants and the people. The provincial government is well aware of this situation and has gradually changed contracting to consignment. Those whose contract period has expired are generally ordered to be merged into various special business tax bureaus and tax bureaus for collection, and no longer recruit merchants to contract. After this reorganization of Fujian's finances, monthly revenue has gradually increased. According to the Finance Department's report, the total revenue in July of the 25th year of the Republic of China was more than 444,000 yuan, 533,000 yuan in August, 633,000 yuan in September, 899,000 yuan in October, 773,000 yuan in November, and more than 1.04 million yuan in December (of which 60,000 yuan was an advance payment, so the actual total revenue was more than 978,000 yuan). The largest progress in each month was special business tax, followed by slaughter tax and brokerage tax. However, land tax revenue has not increased. The expenditures in each month have also gradually increased. In the December 25th expenditure, debt repayment and interest payment alone reached more than 550,000 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure were still insufficient.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen has designated this year as the year of economic construction in Fujian Province. Local construction projects are being actively promoted. Therefore, raising resources, consolidating local taxes, and increasing tax revenue are the primary goals. It was decided to convene a local financial conference in the province on April 6, attended by ㊀ the Director, Secretary, Section Chief, and Director of the Finance Department, ㊁ the Director of the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government and the Finance Section Chiefs of each county, ㊂ the heads of various tax agencies, and ㊃ experts designated by the chairman. The Finance Department Director will serve as the chairman. The scope of discussion is limited to the proposals submitted by the Provincial Chairman, the Finance Department Director, and the Finance Section Chiefs of each city and county. The attendees from each city, county, and tax agency must submit a financial report to the Finance Department Secretariat seven days before the meeting. As the conference date approaches, all counties have successively prepared reports and proposals on their opinions on tax administration and the difficulties encountered and sent them to the province. The General Assembly Office has also been organized, with three groups: General Affairs, Procedures, and Editing, headed by Mao Yiheng, Yan Zhichao, and others. All matters resolved at this meeting will be selected and approved by the Finance Department Director for implementation by the Provincial Government.</p>

<p>Dagongshe said, since the central government approved the tax-free import of foreign rice to Guangdong Province, rice merchants from five provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Shanghai, have petitioned in Beijing to oppose it, but to no avail. Now, foreign rice in Guangdong Province has been imported since April 1. Rice merchants from various provinces and cities believe that this move has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, and they held a joint meeting yesterday and, together with representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, petitioned in Beijing again. The Ministry of Finance will submit this case to the Executive Yuan's routine meeting for discussion tomorrow. Here are the details:</p>

<p>The petition of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grains Associations of this city to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan stated: We note that Guangdong Province requested tax exemption for imported foreign rice, initially citing the high price and shortage of rice, and then worrying about the off-season. To sum up, the reasons are nothing more than these. Whether to approve the tax exemption should be determined by whether domestic rice can meet its needs. According to the Ministry of Finance's careful instructions in December of last year in response to Guangdong Province's request, the agricultural harvests in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces were abundant and had surplus grain that could meet Guangdong Province's needs. Guangdong Province should purchase domestic rice as much as possible to provide relief and adjust the surplus and deficiency, which can be said to be fair and appropriate. Therefore, there is no need to discuss whether Guangdong Province should be exempted from import tax on foreign rice. Afterwards, Guangdong Province still insisted on the request, and the government accommodated its intention, allowing the import of 1.3 million dan of rice at half tax on account, and the Yuehan Railway increased special trains to transport Xiang rice. The Grain Transportation and Marketing Bureau specially hired special ships to transport Wan rice. The government's overall planning for the people's food in Guangdong Province has been all-encompassing. According to the survey report of the Transportation and Marketing Bureau, the so-called rice shortage in Guangdong Province has become a thing of the past. Recently, various producing areas have taken advantage of the abundant harvest last autumn and have carried out a large number of shipments of edible rice to South China. According to estimates by rice merchants in Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces, there are still more than 2 million shi of surplus rice in each of these provinces, which is currently waiting to be transported to Guangdong. According to the "General Situation of National Industry in the 25th Year" compiled and printed by the Statistics Office of the Ministry of Industry last month, the output of indica and japonica rice this year was 859,601,000 dan, an increase of 25,064,000 dan compared to previous years. From this, we know the wealth of surplus rice stored, and it is more credible than the estimates of rice merchants. Moreover, the harvest period in Guangdong Province is earlier than in other provinces. The early rice harvest in Xiang rice is also no later than March. With such cooperation between officials and merchants, how can the people's food in the province not be supplied? We were expecting domestic rice to sell well in Guangdong, and farmers and merchants could benefit from both sides. Unexpectedly, according to reports, starting from April 1, 4 million dan of foreign rice were allowed to be transported to Guangdong tax-free. Earlier, the governments of Hunan and Hubei provinces, upon hearing this news, telegraphed the central government one after another to stop it. It is true that this move will block the throat of domestic rice sales and add wings to the dumping of foreign rice, which will not only increase imports but also violate economic principles. Considering the national economy and the people's livelihood, there is nothing that is feasible. Even if Guangdong does not take this into account, your Excellency should take the overall situation into consideration and coordinate the situation. We propose that the relevant departments be instructed to meet with the leaders of the four provinces of Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei as soon as possible to conduct an accurate survey of the surplus rice in each of these provinces. If the estimates of the rice merchants are not false, then the order for tax exemption for imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province should be immediately revoked, and the rice merchants in the rice-producing provinces should be instructed to rush the rice to Guangdong as much as possible at the same price as foreign rice, so as to avoid the worry of the off-season. Only in this way can it be fair and appropriate, and the rice-producing provinces and the merchants and people of Guangdong Province will be convinced. Now we recommend representatives to respectfully visit your Ministry to petition, and we humbly request your approval and implementation. Presented by Wang, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, Wu, the Minister of Industry, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>One Million Stones of Jiangxi and Hunan Rice Begin Loading in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Representatives of Jiangxi Rice Industry Personally Negotiate Transportation</p>
<p>Last year, Hunan had a bumper harvest of rice, but the Xiang River was low, and transportation was impossible. For half a year, a large amount of Hunan rice was stockpiled and waiting to be transported. Recently, the Xiang River has risen sharply, and the shallowest point has exceeded eleven feet. Large river steamers can directly reach Changsha. On April 1, the Six Companies issued the third announcement on shallow water fees for the Hankou-Changsha section, and all fees were cancelled (i.e., the final 25%). The rice that had been stuck in Hunan was frantically wired to the Six Companies in Shanghai, requesting that a large number of river steamers be sent to Changsha as soon as possible to transport the rice to Shanghai. The most urgent rice to be loaded now is about one million stones in Changsha. The Six Companies have sent river steamers directly to Changsha to compete for the transport of this large amount of rice to the east. In addition to dispatching the "Ming" series of four ships, the Sanbei Company has also transferred the Long'an to Hunan to transport the rice. It is expected that the first batch can be imported within ten days. In addition, Jiangxi has also stockpiled 500,000 to 600,000 stones of rice waiting to be transported to Shanghai. In recent days, grain merchants have been urging the loading very urgently. Shen Huating, director of the China Merchants Bureau in Jiujiang, along with representatives from the Jiangxi rice industry, personally came to Shanghai to negotiate with the head office to add special-purpose steamers for transporting rice to supply the transportation. The negotiations were successful yesterday, and the representatives of the Jiangxi rice industry took the steamer back to Jiangxi that evening to prepare for loading.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioners Lu Bohong and Others Go to Kaifeng, Henan Province, to Distribute Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Received 320,000 Yuan in Relief Funds</p>
<p>The drought in Henan Province is extremely severe. Special commissioners came to Shanghai to appeal for help. Various charitable organizations jointly formed a United Relief Association and have already remitted 320,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. Chang Zhizhen, the acting chairman of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago to thank all parties and accompanied the disaster relief committee members Lu Bohong and others to leave Shanghai last night for Henan to distribute the relief funds. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chang's Departure from Shanghai</p>
<p>After the establishment of the United Relief Association of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, representatives Lu Bohong, Mu Ouchu, and Zhu Ziqiao were sent to investigate. They returned to the association and reported that the disaster in the province was extremely severe, famine was widespread, and people were crying for food. Therefore, the various organizations immediately advanced 320,000 yuan and remitted it to the Henan Provincial Relief Committee for emergency relief. Chang Zhizhen, the acting chairman of the committee, came to Shanghai a few days ago to thank all sectors and accompanied the disaster relief committee members Lu Bohong, Li Shaoduo, Bi Yuncheng, and many staff members to leave Shanghai last night via Nanjing. They will join Guo Fangwu, the director of the Xindu Orphanage in Henan Province who is in Nanjing, and travel together to Kaifeng to negotiate with the Henan Provincial Government and the Relief Committee to determine the method of distributing the relief funds. Last night, fellow Henan provincials living in Shanghai went to the station to see them off.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Funds</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Chang at his lodging. According to him, the relief funds received totaled 320,000 yuan from various charitable organizations, including 120,000 yuan for work relief and 200,000 yuan for emergency relief. Some charitable organizations have already automatically remitted funds for disaster relief. Although the amount may still be insufficient, he is very grateful for the enthusiasm of all parties. As for the provincial government, it has also raised 850,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan for emergency relief and the remaining funds for work relief. The four highways of Luoye, Luogong, Luomeng, Yandeng have been designated for paving the road surface, and work has already begun. The strong men along the road can be accommodated, and wages of 20 cents will be paid for each job. Other projects will be launched in order as needed. If the funds are insufficient, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to provide subsidies. As for emergency relief matters, a disaster relief office has been specially set up to assign personnel to go to the countryside to distribute relief. Chen Bohong will return to Shanghai first, and the remaining personnel will stay in the province to supervise the distribution.</p>
<p>Tragic Situation of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Chang Father discussed the tragic situation of the disaster victims in various places in the province. According to him, less than two or three out of a hundred households in a village can afford to eat rice, and less than eight or nine can grind tree bark and bran into flour to make a paste to feed themselves. The rest have exhausted their rice and flour, and their houses are empty. Everywhere you look, people are digging soil and stones underground to fill their hunger. The situation is so tragic that it is unimaginable. Therefore, they cry all day long and are on the verge of death. Emergency relief cannot be delayed. There are now more than 1,500 tons of miscellaneous grains stored in Beiping. If there are relief funds, they can be purchased and distributed. Chang then showed various samples collected from various places, such as grain bran flour and stone flour, and urged wide publicity. So far this year, the area along the Longhai Railway in the province is still suffering from drought and no rain, and spring plowing has not been able to enter the soil. The suffering in the future will be even greater than today. This is a major crisis, he said.</p>

The amount of investment must be based on the assets, liabilities, and business conditions of each company and shop. The Joint Office of Domestic Goods Companies will assist in the accounting of assets. 3.

<h3>Jisheng Association Investigates the Tragic Situation of the Henan Disaster</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association and the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association jointly organized the Henan Relief and jointly recommended Feng Junwei Yangshan and Zheng Juncan Shouchang to go to Henan to investigate the disaster. Now, a letter has been received from Feng from the disaster area, stating that the situation in the ten counties in western Henan is more serious than in other places. There has been no rain since June last year, the ground is cracked, the villages are desolate, people are displaced, and the corpses of the starving are everywhere. The thin and weak bodies stagger and fall to their deaths, which is unbearable to hear. Recently, the tree bark and grass roots that have been eaten are exhausted, and mountain stones are ground into flour to fill hunger. It is difficult to digest and has no nourishment. Eating it causes abdominal distension and constipation, and death soon follows. Dengfeng in western Henan is the most tragic area. The association has recognized the relief in Dengfeng. It is said that there are more than 240,000 disaster victims in the county. This spring, apart from those who have died and have not returned, there are now more than 60,000 very poor people, about 100,000 or more poor people. There is an increasing number of poor people. A drop in the bucket is impossible to save. Please report the situation and ask the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association to increase the amount of relief. The association has discussed and tried to increase the relief funds with the Chinese and Foreign Righteous Relief Association and invited several relief friends to take a car to Henan last night to transfer to Dengfeng from Yanshi to investigate and release the funds. However, the disaster is severe and the funds are meager. If they are not rescued, they will not survive. Good people, save this remnant and hope for it.</p>

<h3>All Overseas Chinese in Paris Contribute Opinions on Participating in the Exposition</h3>
<p>It was recently learned from a visit to the office of the delegation participating in the Paris International Exposition that all overseas Chinese in Paris sent an important letter to the association, stating the significance of holding the exposition and the preparations that should be made for participation. The letter was very detailed. The following is a copy of the letter:</p>
<p>The "International Exposition of Modern Living Arts and Technology" to be held in Paris from May to October this year is a grand international movement to promote modern social civilization and material progress. It is of great importance to the development of the future of nations and countries. Therefore, countries around the world are enthusiastically participating, with the number now exceeding fifty. Among the countries that stand in this modern era, only China has not participated. Recently, the opening date of the exposition is approaching, and the construction of the venue is almost complete. News has come from the motherland that academic groups have jointly initiated participation with the Shanghai business community. This is a very good phenomenon. All overseas Chinese are very happy to hear about it. However, due to the vast distance between the country and overseas, the people of the country may not be fully aware of the actual situation of this exposition. Therefore, we are providing a brief overview: "A" The significance of holding this exposition. According to the association's charter, the greatest significance of holding the exposition lies in stimulating modern production capacity, exchanging ideas and emotions between nations, and conveying the unique characteristics of their countries, thereby promoting international culture in the twentieth century. "B" The standard program for this exposition and the necessary preparations for China's participation. The program for exhibits as stipulated by the association can be summarized into the following twelve items: ㊀ Performances of artistic movements. ㊁ Inventions of industrial technology. ㊂ Educational systems and their structures at all levels. ㊃ Facilities for art and technical education. ㊄ Social life phenomena and their education. ㊅ Family education. ㊆ Modern construction of cities and villages. ㊇ Daily necessities and decorations. ㊈ Plastic arts. ㊉ Printing and publishing. ㊉㊀ Transportation. ㊉㊁ Customs and etiquette. The items listed above are all closely related to human life and are more educational in nature. They should be expressed in various ways and cannot be represented by a portion of exhibits. For China's participation this time, the following preparations should be made: ㊀ Regarding exhibits, new-style charts and on-site photographs with a consistent system should be created based on the aforementioned standard program, so as to represent the new spirit, new construction, new education, and new life of the entire Chinese nation and national revolution, thereby dispelling foreigners' contemptuous and evil views of Chinese society. ㊁ Regarding dynamic performances, the most valuable and representative films and dramas of the era in China should be gathered to perform at the exposition. At the same time, famous domestic scholars should be invited to the exposition to give long-term lectures on promoting the inherent national spirit of China, thereby promoting China's inherent national spirit. ㊂ Regarding printing and written publicity, a national construction plan for the entire country should be compiled, focusing on photographic illustrations, including social life, construction projects, education, health, academic inventions, etc., with explanations in English and French, so that foreigners can understand the true social phenomena of China and know how to respect it. Furthermore, the living conditions of farmers in the lost northeastern provinces and the current situation of the volunteer army should also be promoted as much as possible. "C" Even if China cannot formally participate, work should still be actively carried out. This exposition is a major international movement to promote modernity and also a good opportunity for international publicity. Our country is an ancient country with four thousand years of culture and should naturally have something to show. In today's time of national crisis, we must do our best to arouse international sympathy. Therefore, we believe that at least we should: ㊀ Print and distribute publications for publicity, including the aforementioned national construction plan and a collection of photographs of Chinese social life, with many photographs and illustrations, accompanied by famous Chinese works of art, to be distributed to various sectors at the conference. At the same time, rent a space in the public areas of the venue as a distribution point for this publicity. ㊁ Hold a Chinese art exhibition. One of the major significance of holding this exposition lies in the preservation of permanent modern art after the exposition. This new museum is large in scale. In the future, carefully selected works of art from various countries will be exhibited in it. Recently, a national art exhibition was held in China. If good works can be collected after the exhibition and transported to Paris for exhibition, it can not only promote China's unique Oriental art but also find ways to include our country's art exhibition works in the modern art museum to compensate for the failure to formally participate. It is indeed a win-win situation. It is heard that the delegation office has fully adopted the above opinions, and many of the points have already been handled, such as printing publicity materials. The points that have not been handled have been sent to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Communications, the Railway Department, the National Economic Commission, the Construction Committee, and the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters for assistance.</p>
<h3>Qingming Ancestor Worship Breaking Superstition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government believes that every Qingming Festival, the people mostly indulge in feasting, wasting money, and burning ingots, which are superstitious acts. Therefore, it has repeatedly issued notices to persuade the abolition of these practices. It is now learned that during this year's Qingming Festival, the gentry and scholars in the county mostly followed the ancestor worship methods of the Shuxiang Improvement Association, abolishing feasting and burning ingots, only offering incense, flowers, and fresh produce. The head of the family led the family members to pay respects in order, and then the head of the family was invited to describe the virtues of the ancestors to commemorate them.</p>
<h3>Monstrous Fetus Corpse Found on Jiaole Road</h3>
<p>In front of No. 200 Jiaole Road (near the intersection of Lafayette Road) in the French Concession, under the street edge, at eight o'clock yesterday morning, an abandoned rush bag was found, containing the corpse of a male infant who had just been born and died. The inspectors examined the corpse and found it to be a monster fetus. The head and body were the same as ordinary infants who die immediately after birth. The only difference was that a reproductive organ grew in the center of the forehead, with a stem about five minutes long. Both eyes were merged into one eye socket, with no nasal bridge or passage. The mouth was smaller than usual, and the ears were similar to monkey ears. The umbilical cord was connected to the placenta without being cut. For a time, it attracted curious onlookers to speculate. It seemed that the family was frightened after the birth and suffocated the child to death before abandoning the corpse. The inspector reported to the French Police Department, which sent detectives to investigate and notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall to order a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Ciyou Association Maid Training Institute Officially Established to Shelter Maids</h3>
<p>Attached to Lafayette Road Ciyou Training Institute, now housing and educating over twenty people.</p>
<p>The China Ciyou Association, recognizing the urgency of the problem of liberating maids, has specially established a maid training institute to take in homeless and abused maids who have been rescued through various means, so that they can live independently in the future. It has now been formally established, attached to the association's Ciyou Training Institute on Lafayette Road. According to Chen Tiesheng, the vice president of the association, the establishment of the maid training institute is to rescue maids. It has now taken in over twenty people, two-thirds of whom were sent by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the rest were mostly rescued by the institute. The original plan included instruction in household work and childcare. However, those who have been taken in are all under the age of fifteen. Due to their young age, primary school-level books are temporarily used as the teaching standard. All clothing, food, medicine, and other items are provided by the institute.</p>

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Textbook Price Reduction Issue</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The issue of textbook price reduction is worth discussing. Because this issue is related to the popularization of education, it is very important and cannot be ignored. The Ministry of Education previously ordered various bookstores to review and reduce the prices of textbooks. The Book Industry Association stated that due to rising paper and raw material costs, they could not comply. Regarding this matter, the Municipal Education Association recently listed the reasons why textbook prices should be reduced and appealed to various bookstores to implement price reductions. The next day, the Book Industry Association again stated the reasons why prices could not be reduced and responded to the points raised by the Education Association. From this, it is clear that the book industry is unwilling to reduce textbook prices.</p>
<p>Textbook prices should be sold at the lowest possible price. The reasons for this are simple: First, textbooks are a tool for popularizing education. If they are not sold at a low price, they cannot be popularized. Second, textbook prices must be low to reduce students' education costs and make it easier for ordinary people to attend school. Third, textbook sales are very large, and selling them at a low price can still yield substantial profits. Fourth, the book industry has a mission to promote education. For textbooks, they should be especially self-restrained.</p>
<p>However, textbooks are often regarded as "rare goods" in the book industry. This can be seen by looking at the competition among various bookstores to publish textbooks and the past competitive situation. The Ministry of Education ordered various bookstores to review and reduce textbook prices. This is a very good move. If various bookstores can consider the future of education in our country, they should comply immediately. However, the Book Industry Association's unwillingness to implement price reductions on the grounds of rising paper and raw material costs is disappointing.</p>
<p>Whether textbook prices can be reduced depends on the cost. The cost of textbooks is not something outsiders can understand. According to the calculations of the Municipal Education Association, the cost of World Elementary School Chinese Language Textbook Volume 3 is only 1.8 cents, and the cost of Commercial Press Elementary School Chinese Language Textbook Volume 3 is only 12.7 cents. The former is priced at 6 cents, and the latter is priced at 90 cents, which shows that the profit is quite high. Even according to the book industry, this is only a part of the cost, and there are other expenses. Now, assuming that the cost of the former is 3 cents and the cost of the latter is 30 cents, the difference from the selling price is still far, and further reducing it should be possible.</p>
<p>"The association believes that fellow members must first seek to maintain their survival before they can contribute to education." This is naturally correct. No one is willing to sacrifice their capital to promote textbooks. However, on the other hand, it is also inappropriate to focus entirely on textbooks. What attitude do various bookstores have when publishing textbooks? Is it more about serving education or more about making money?</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the textbook price reduction issue, it is hoped that the book industry can reduce prices somewhat under the principle of not losing money. This may have some impact on various bookstores. However, it will greatly benefit the popularization of education. Even setting aside the big picture, in recent years, the burden of education expenses for children in ordinary student families is extremely heavy. If various bookstores can review and reduce textbook prices, this will be a great benefit to those seeking education.</p>
<h3>Notes on Returning to My Hometown</h3>
<p>— Liu Ziming</p>
<p>On the second day of returning to my hometown, relatives from near and far came to my house. They all seemed very happy that I returned to my hometown around Qingming every year. In my hometown, tomb sweeping is considered the most important thing. I am an only child, and after my parents died, I became a lone wanderer. However, I probably don't even understand the reason why I have to go back around Qingming every year. Does a young man who wanders outside all year long naturally yearn for home? But why must I go back at this time? To win the happiness of those relatives? Of course not, but who is urging me: "You have to go back!" In fact, spring in my hometown is no longer the time when warblers are flying around.</p>
<p>My uncle told me: The tomb keeper said last year that the bamboo fence on the ancestral tomb has become a den for stray dogs, and the planted pines and cypresses have been chopped down by children on fishing boats to be used as firewood... Although he did not say that he wanted me to go and take a look at the tomb immediately, that is something that descendants should do. I thanked him for his kindness and went to the tomb by boat the next day.</p>
<p>The boatman used to be a long-term worker in my family. Now he rents a Mátó boat and lives on the water. His home is the boat, and the boat is his home. Qingming is the busiest time of the year. He hired another helper. It is said that he can maintain his simple life by relying on the business of one spring. The boat left Chihe and encountered a favorable wind. So he raised the sails and let the helper steer the rudder at the stern. He crawled into the cabin to chat with me.</p>
<p>He was still like he was when he was a long-term worker in my family. He liked to drink and tell jokes. It's just that his forehead was covered with wrinkles from life, his temples were dyed with pale short hair, and perhaps his figure had become a little thinner than before. Climbing into the cabin, he first laughed. That kind of inexplicable goodwill could only be repaid with a smile after putting down my books and newspapers. He estimated the weight of the boat and sat down opposite me with a plop. He wiped his thick lips with the back of his big hand, and then took out a small wine bottle from his waist bag. He uncorked the bottle, tilted his head and took two sips, and then wiped his lips with the back of his hand before saying, "Aguan, do you still remember scolding me for being a drunkard?"</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often pestered him to tell stories, but the pungent smell of alcohol was really hard to bear. The other children often scolded him for being a drunkard too. Now I can only smile at him because I know that his wife was lost to drinking. Mentioning alcohol might evoke the honest man's sorrow. But he said it himself:</p>
<p>"Aguan, I'm afraid only I, A'er, have lost a wife to drinking. I don't know which unlucky ghost that stinky woman is selling herself to now. Aguan, do you remember? It was the little maid from Master Yang's house."</p>
<p>I nodded. When he got his hands on that little maid, he also took a shortcut. Master Yang gave her to A'er in a muddle-headed way to avoid trouble, but in the end, it came to nothing.</p>
<p>"Are you living alone now?" I asked him, "I'm afraid there are no more little maids in Master Yang's house."</p>
<p>"Aguan, don't make fun of me." He took a sip of wine, wiped his lips with the back of his hand, as if that action was inseparable. "Isn't it much easier to live alone? A wife is simply a shackle, tying you down and preventing you from taking a step. Once you take a step away, she flies away..."</p>
<p>He shook his head, drank wine again, and wiped his lips. Perhaps he had more complaints that he couldn't express in words. And I, the Aguan who used to sit on his lap and peel edamame pods, was so speechless to him now.</p>
<p>Traveling with the wind, we arrived in just half the time. When docking, A'er crawled out of the cabin to take in the sails. After the boat docked, he was the first to jump up and tie the cable, and then shouted loudly to the old man who kept the tomb in the tomb house. From the cabin, I couldn't even recognize which one was my family's tomb. I remember when my grandfather was buried, there was a shed built on the road from the shore to the tomb, the tomb was covered with fresh soil, and the surrounding pines and cypresses covered it like big umbrellas. It was a good feng shui that Master Kan had found. The old man came out of the tomb house. Looking at his staggering appearance, wasn't he just as unsuccessful as we were in fighting the children on fishing boats and fighting life?</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua (12)</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezuo</p>
<p>The agitation of the Boxers finally angered the imperialists. In the eyes of the great powers, China was the best "colony." How could their flames of aggression be extinguished? They united the armies of eight countries and wantonly slaughtered in China!</p>
<p>The old man sighed to me that he was too useless, and bowed his head apologetically. I comforted him instead, gave him a little more money, and told him to fix the bamboo fence properly. I don't want to use feng shui to give me any help, but if the tombs of my ancestors become dens for stray dogs, I will not be at peace.</p>
<p>A'er probably drank too much wine and talked to the old man in the loudest voice: "Aguan will make a fortune in the future and build a big tomb house. The ancestors are lucky, and you old man will also share the glory."</p>
<p>I wanted to ask if he was thinking about his runaway wife again? A middle-aged man would not fail to think about his future home. His wife ran away, and naturally he didn't have a son yet. Drunken words reveal the true heart. Was the old man's grief even greater than mine? The words came to my lips, but I swallowed them in the end. I asked him to hurry back and treat him to a catty of baigan in town.</p>
<h3>Talking About Foreign Superstitions</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>We often hear people say: "Today, science is flourishing, and all superstitions should be overthrown." Others say: "The Chinese are the most superstitious." In fact, while the Chinese are indeed superstitious, foreigners are no less superstitious. Walking under a ladder leaning against a wall is considered bad luck by foreigners. The famous scientist Albert Einstein once preferred to wade through water rather than walk under a ladder, which shows that science is sometimes no match for superstition.</p>
<p>There are many types of superstition. One is believing in the good or bad omens of future events. Many Chinese and foreigners believe that dream omens are very accurate. Now, let's talk about one or two foreign dream interpretations: If you dream of having a tooth pulled out and bleeding a lot, it is a bad omen. You must guard against relatives becoming ill, or even dying. Dreaming of losing something on your body and bleeding a lot is also a bad omen. If you have a tooth pulled out without blood, although it is not auspicious, it has nothing to do with your relatives. However, you must guard against minor misfortunes, but you don't have to worry too much. Dreaming of the dead has many implications. If the dead person is walking with a living person, be prepared to encounter a funeral. If the dead person gives some food or something else to a living person, the recipient will encounter auspicious events. If you dream of the dead giving you something while you are sick, it is a sign that you will recover soon. Some people who are not deeply superstitious also believe that dreams are a prediction of future events. They say that dreams are the brain's subconscious activity while asleep. Future events can indeed be projected in the brain in advance, but fools cannot perceive it for a while.</p>
<p>Some small things that happen occasionally can also be taken as a kind of prediction. If you accidentally spill salt on the table while eating, the people at the table will definitely be unhappy because it is a sign of arguments. If two engaged people are walking together on a rainy day and encounter a car driving by that splashes mud all over their bodies, ordinary people will definitely scold the driver. However, future couples who encounter this kind of thing do not feel sorry for their clothes being dirtied. They are also happy because it is a sign of sharing weal and woe and being united until old age. If a future couple is walking on the road and has to cross the road, and there happens to be a tree in front of them, and one walks past the left side of the tree and the other walks past the right side of the tree, that is something to be avoided. They should quickly shrink back and walk on the same side, otherwise, I am afraid that good things will be delayed and the mandarin ducks will be separated soon.</p>
<p>Female school students also have many superstitions. If two people say the same thing at the same time, that is an excellent opportunity. Quickly wrap your little fingers together and wish for what you desire in your heart, and you can be sure that your wish will soon be fulfilled. If young ladies are moved by their own marriage, they can borrow an engagement ring from their engaged friend and put it on the finger on which they wear an engagement ring for a minute or two. During this time, turn the ring three times and silently wish for what you desire in your heart. Then, you can be sure that within three months, your marriage will be a coincidence and you will find a lifelong companion. Or, on a clear night when the new moon rises, silently wish to the moon. Although the moon itself is a virgin and has nothing to do with the opposite sex, she is very willing to help people achieve good things and make you achieve your wishes.</p>
<p>Talking about superstition can definitely not be exhausted in a short article. The older the era, the more superstitions there are. China is originally an ancient country, so naturally there are superstitions everywhere. However, before the twentieth century, if you talked about superstition, everyone believed it and was not ashamed. Today, people who think they are more knowledgeable than old women will denounce it as stubborn.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing to never forget. Shakespeare said in his collection that if Roman Emperor Caesar had listened to his wife's warning on the night he was assassinated, perhaps he would not have suffered that disaster. Wasn't Caesar a very decisive husband? He laughed at his wife's superstition, but what was the result? (Translated from the English "Great American Evening News")</p>
