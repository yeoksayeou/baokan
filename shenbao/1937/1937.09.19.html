<h3>戰時的民衆</h3>

<p>—某高級指揮官的談話</p>
<p>（本報特寫）連朝陰雨，好不納悶，可是一上前綫，看到忠勇將士們的精神抖擻，像生龍活虎那般的氣魄，不由你不頓時興奮起來。昨天下午，約莫四點光景，我曾冒着濛雨，和莊仲文敎授驅車至××陣，他已去過兩次，路徑很熟，繞道至某地，得和高級指揮官××將軍作一度談話，將軍公務冗忙，他要批公文，閱電信，接電話，在這短短一小時的會話中，談了又停，停了又談，差不多分成七八段了。所說的話，有些不便發表的，這裹，把可以公開的，拉雜寫來，讀者當可會意。</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>「平時沒有把民衆組織得好，戮時便吃了許審虧，目前後方應立即開始訓練民衆，把各個單位，互相聯繁，在信任政府和領袖的原則之下多研究，多商討，大家努力本位救國的工作，無形中可推動前方部隊的殺敵致果的效能。消極的，如助理前方供應，檢舉漢奸活動，維持地方秩序；積極的，增加一切生産，參加戰時工作，訓練後方民衆等，不勝枚舉。要如像目前戰地上，只見漢奸，不見民衆，那是很痛心的。</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>「到如今，還有許多人對抗戰的意義，還認識不淸，須知敵國欲滅我中華，是既定的國策，我們惟有立定脚跟，咬緊牙關，趁今朝民情激昂的時候，拚個你死我活。明知這次抗戰的犧牲很大，然而這犧牲是有代價的。即使我們失掉一城一邑，而這些地方，一定是經過砲火之後，一片焦土，敵人也無所用處，敵人跋涉遠洋，勞師動衆，困難既多，消耗亦大，我則天時，地利，人和，三者兼備，此時不戰，更待何時？</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>“我們抗戰的方針，早就决定持久戰，消耗戰，即使戰至三年五年，依然不變初衷，我們要有百折不撓的精神，不能有患得患失的心理，所以我（××將軍自稱）有兩句口號：可以獻給同胞，即是㊀中途妥恊是投降，㊁委曲求全是自殺！</p>

<p>「我們的領袖，是署名的天才軍事家，但看過去歷次戰爭，一般人認爲冒險，而結果都是勝利。這次抗戰，領袖早已成竹在胸，記得暑期在廬山時他曾對我們說過：」三年之內，我一定可以打倒日本帝國主義者，只要四萬萬人跟我走！」我們的領袖是革命家，他已完成了統一中國的偉大使命，第二步工作，是怎樣復興中國？而日本竟不斷侵略，甚至愈來愈兇，我們以後出路，惟有全國一致，不惜犧牲，抗戰到底，現在正是抗戰的開始！</p>

<h3>工廠遷往內地問題</h3>
<p>— 鳴</p>
<p>工廠遷往內地。不特在此抗戰期間。為時勢所要求。卽平時為培植國力。整頓國防。也是應有的布置。原來現代工業若單就商業經濟論。選擇廠址。理想上只須具備四要件。第一。水陸運輸要便利。第二。原料取給要便利。第三。動力假借要便利。第四。資金流轉要便利。但若能認識工農為一國自給自足的命脈。維護保全。務使不可一日停頓。則安全第一。凡上述所謂便利的條件皆次之。設若廠址適當安全。卽使天然上的便利條件不能具備。也儘可由人工補益的，例如交通可以興建，原料可以存儲。動力可以開發。資金可以隨附。如此相需相助。工業藉國力自存。國力藉工業不敝。</p>
<p>我國僅有極淺薄的工業基礎。皆散布於沿海口岸，考其原因除地點差可適合於商業經濟上所謂便利條件外。向日國家視工業為稅源。工業認國家為地主。國家漠視工業的展布。工業界深染自由貿易的思想。甚且有依傍外力。因以為利的念頭。是國家的失策。也是工業界的短視。試單觀上海虹口浦東工廠區的毀滅。便是眼前的事實敎訓。或謂在此空炸轟轟砲擊隆隆聲中。方纔計劃遷移。不免臨時抱佛脚。但平時過失。不在一方。於今誰也不該怨怪得誰。現在火已延燒到眼前。能搶救得多少就是能保全得多少。殘餘比全毀終較勝些罷。立國計百年的安享，立廠也應謀永久的基礎。一時的艱難不可畏怯。萬一的徼倖尤不可存心。</p>
<p>我國處亞洲大陸。素稱得江河水利。原來水利本是最經濟鐵道公路皆不能及。工廠遷入內地貨運必然增加。也許更可推動江河的修治疏濬。西北水流急湍。大可逐漸利用生發動力。鑛產的開發。雖一時未必能觀成。但植物原料。必能隨需求以適應和改進。他若人口的移殖。資金的流入。更為情勢所必然。歐美稱工廠區的建立。為生產集團因中心的移轉附麗必相隨。加以政府的扶助。當不患孤懸荒地。自生自滅的。</p>
<p>今旣决計遷入內地了。那麽相度地域。自是最重要的問題，暴露着給空襲砲擊做目標。江邊與海。曾無稍異。羣集一處。甲地與乙地。也無稍異。工廠宜散置。不宜集合。須隱蔽又須便利。散置的利益很多。例如發展時。可以從容工人可以散居。建置可以橫擴。保衛經濟。兼而有之。工作能散也宜散。如手工業輕工業大可分發工人家製作。所謂藏工於農。工人也可以兼事耕耘。自給上使得挹注。歐洲地域雖侷促。尚有行之者。俄美兩國。更有不少先例。可以效法所謂隱蔽。例如蘇俄建廠於深山築煙突於山後。但仍當擇原料取給。水陸運輸。相當便利。和逐漸可以改進的地域方不陷於自己封鎖自己的失策。於此不過提供一些淺近的意思。至於設廠計劃。廠主專家。應考慮需要决定之。遷廠辦法。有主管官廳與各同業公會的部署。可不贅述。</p>

<h3>龔斯德博士忠吿日本國民書</h3>
<p>敬啟者、德此次致書忠吿貴國人士、事　冒昧、然局勢如斯、心實謂危、故未敢緘默、掬誠以吿、鑒諒與否、在所不計也、蓋德之作此書、不外出於三點、一德對於貴國百問敢稱良友、而於貴國人十素所欽羨、二則深恐日本人民、因國家領袖之錯誤主張、而尤以軍事當局之迷夢、致被蓄蔽、導入歧途、三則此種意見、靡府德個人獨具、即舉世人士莫不見及、故欲竭誠舉以奉吿、區區之意、諒能鑒納也、</p>
<p>德對貴國友誼、可舉一事以爲明證、査日美兩國之間、曾以移民問題、頗有發生誤會、德近兩晤羅斯福總統、一再請其設法、緩和兩國間緊張之態度、冀使日本移民美國、可以得到按照人數之比額、否則依據世界其他各國公定移民百份二之原則、則全亞人民可以移居美國者、每年祇限二百五十人、而日本更無論矣、誠能如是、則從此不公之分配、以及對於日本移民之制限、皆得糾正而鬆放矣、深信雜總統及其他各國當局對於此種建議、俱有採納之意、德旅居亞洲三十年、其中多在印度、在此三十年中、親見日本人民日有進步、實為欣羨、當時深望日本出而領導亞洲、以從事於積極之建設、而維護和平之善意、以爲亞洲自是得以改變局勢、而不似歐洲今日之糾紛、詎知吾人之願望皆成泡影、日本且於亞洲演出劇烈之戰爭、結成不解之讐恨、不知採取正道、以友誼之態度、及合作之精神、取得中國之問情、自是再進而爲亞洲之盟主、今也大道弗由、而竟走入迷途、斯可慨也、</p>
<p>按日本人民所取之態度不外有三、一則保守孤立、二與中國善意合作、如是可以促成中日兩國之發達、三則與華爲仇、因而仇及亞洲、而最後大勢所趨、或將與世為敵、總論上述三種態度、第一種爲不可能之事實、第二種日本已經明白拒絕、而且採取第三種之動態、此誠大誤名也、日本具有遠大眼光之政治家、多數力倡第二種之方策、使日本當日聽從此種主張、則其補裨於中國與亞洲者當不少也、且日本之可以大貫獻於世界之要需者實多、然日本曁立軍事障礙、致與世界發生隔膜、而不能得到其貢獻、</p>
<p>日本人士答稱、中日之所以不能合作者、實由於中國反對之態度、拒絕合作有以致之、試問中國是否拒絕合作、中國固不能一任日本併吞其土地、而侵犯具主權、此種假名之合作、中國當然予以拒絕、而世界公論、且以此贊揚其拒絕之有方也、蓋此實非合作、而為獨霸、直主人對於奴僕之行爲耳、使中國盲然接受此種合作、則必喪失國魂、而不成為國家、試問貴國人士對於屈服之中國、平心而論、復能尊重其為國乎、深信稍有氣概之日人、必曰否也、</p>
<p>至於日本人口過剩之問題、日本有何出路、人口過剩固爲貴國切耍問題、而德亦深信當力請世界、予以重視、妥爲設法、惟是對於中國本部、能否容納日本過剩之人口、請本諸良心、試為考盧、可藉此為目前侵略之口實否耶、中國本部、茲姑不論、即滿洲三省之侵佔、亦不得以此為理由、蓋當三十年前滿洲開放、移殖其地、從事開墾者　爲三千萬之華人、而非日本之人民也、此豈不足以見人口緊迫之所在、蓋人口之緊密、實在華而不在日也、使日本不能移殖其民於人口比較稀少之滿洲、則其農民如何可與中國本部人煙稠密之農民、爭相競處、吾恐日本此次侵略中國之行為、難以人口過剩為理由、其眞正之原因、蓋別有在也、若謂“中國混亂、官吏腐敗、奠定中國、實為日本國家之使命”、然中國固曾混亂一時、但一代之間、已經五次革命、官吏方面、固有幾分腐敗、而德在中國官吏前亦曾發表諍論、方主革新、實際上中國國民自身曾努力改革、各方面多已改良、戰事初起之際、中國人民正在整肅官箴、大著成效至於國內紛亂、近兩年來較之過去二十五年中、任何時期、實已少見、現正極度發達、國內一致團結、各種改良、世所罕見、故今日貴國之所謂對華“使命”、實已不合其時、若研其實、日本此次阻撓中國、其結果無他不外引起紛亂、發生破裂、結成仇怨、而其禍且方始未已也、貴國現在對於中國、可謂極力阻礙其進展、倘使日本眞欲中國發達、何不聽其自由、而必於其建設極度之時加以阻力耶、若謂日本阻撓中國、不過引起一時混亂、但將來必能予以安定、目舉高麗、滿洲往事以爲例證、一似甚有其理者焉、然德實未敢置信也、蓋此次事件、與前不同、日本現用武力、欲制一大國之死命、須如中國對於邊區、如高麗滿洲兩地、或能忍痛屈服、而其中部絕對不能任人侵略、决努力奮鬥、以求領土之完整、即使長期抗戰、亦所不計、然此已足銷磨日本之精力矣、方今世界風雲日急、一旦日本有事於俄、則此四萬萬之勁敵、滿具力量之民族、寗不爲肘腋之大患乎、此後連年多事、日本處此情形之下、其眞能無懼耶、且此次戰事日本縱得勝利、然亦不足解决一切、而其所種之怨毒、恐將爲世所棄、况中國决心長期抗戰、日本師老無功、將來勝利未必能操左券、而目前日本經濟之危期、加以一般同情中國之國家、或將與日絕交經濟、則日本在華之戰事、恐難維持而不敗也、至若華北日人之被殺、及上海飛機塲之事變、此固可為扼腕但推原禍始、凡此事實、無非起於同一之禍因、即日本侵略中國之土地是也、蓋日本侵害中國、致而激成事變、故此事變不得謂為此次戰事之原因、此則應請貴國人士明察者也、據德觀察、日本對於中國之態度、不外出於輕視與恐懼兩者之間、輕視其政府與人民、而恐懼其目前驚人之進步也、方今中國進步迅速、所謂輕視之態度、自不成為理由、日本侵略中國之主因、蓋出於恐懼之心理、以爲日本統治中國、此正其時、過此中國强大機制、此則日本侵華眞正之原因、其他所提之理由、不外近似而已、然而日本之欲統治中國、則明甚矣、</p>
<p>惟是日本欲樹勢力於中國、其道有二、一則憑藉武力、一則結以友誼、現在日本已取武力之道、此實自取敗亡、而結一累世不解之深仇也、日本自謂日本得志於華、則中國必無能爲、而其微弱之憤怒、亦不足長、”是則非德之所敢深信也、</p>
<p>中國人民四萬萬、日本對此偉大民族、能否長久壓服、須知中國非印度可比、不宜以之相提並論、英國縱失印度·尚屬無礙、蓋彼此相距實遠也、日本之於中國則不然、縱使一時可以制服、將來如有一失、本國恐將隨之而亡、蓋中國不能獨立則已、一能獨立、必將日本吞併、誠以中日土地毘連、而日本之民族亦較小也、</p>
<p>誠恐貴國當局、殘民以逞、而爲孤注之擲、目下縱能勝利、前途實堪危懼、而況勝利誰屬、尚未可必、中國方且决心長期抗戰、以銷磨日本之精力、長此以往、患难愈深不但自貽伊戚、而且爲害鄰邦也、（未完）</p>

<h3>敵軍第三次大敗績連日傾師來犯傷亡慘重</h3>
<p>羅店附近激戰敵兵死亡逾萬　楊木僑之役我斃敵中佐一名　敵機三十除架今晨窺探浦東</p>
<p>自滬戰發生從、敵初受挫於上海、繼乃襲一二八之故技、傾其主力於瀏河登陸、希圖威脅我之側背、不料於羅店之役、被我殲滅殆盡、乃不得不向國內乞援、迨本月一日以來、復挾其海陸空之精銳及機械化部隊、由吳淞强行登陸、進犯我北泗塘及楊行附近之陣地、經我軍英勇抗戰、斃敵甚多、我軍為一網打盡計、逐漸引敵深入、敵以為勝利、貿然輕進、連日於永安橋·楊木橋·附近激戰甚烈、至十七日、敵不惜盡其所有之精銳、作孤注之一擲、企圖於九一八之前夕、與我决戰、孰知我軍早已窺破其陰謀、我前方將士忠勇為國、不惜犧牲、以一當百、予敵以迎頭痛擊、經數度衝鋒、遂將敵完全殲滅於我陣地之前方、是為戰事發生以來第三次之大敗績、</p>
<h3>敵軍三次總攻死亡逾萬士氣沮喪</h3>
<p>羅店全鎮化為灰燼　界涇河水盡成赤色</p>
<p>記者今晨曾赴淞滬戰綫視察、獲晤某高級長官、據談楊行月浦以及羅店方面、連日戰况甚詳茲特紀述於下、</p>
<p>速戰速决計不得逞</p>
<p>本月十二日敵陸軍第三·第六·第十一·第十二·第十六·及新增之第九各師團、及利用優勢之海空軍、開始向我作第三期總攻、其主力由楊行月浦沿寶劉及寶羅兩公路之兩側地區、向我陳地中央攻擊、企圖於九一八以前、截斷滬太公路、確占淞滬、並以一部由羅店及川沙方面向我突擊、以解被我包圍之部隊、</p>
<p>兩次慘敗敵受重創</p>
<p>十三·十四兩日、迭衣顧家角·徐家角·永安橋等處、與我軍作劇烈之爭奪戰、我軍將士俱抱與陣地同存亡之决心、待其步兵接近時、卽行迎擊、斃敵多人、尸橫遍野、其攻擊毫無進步、是敵第一次之頓挫、十四日黃昏後、我乘敵疲憊、全綫逆襲、於羅店北方地區、戰鬥尤為猛烈、盛橋·六維橋·潘家橋站等處敵軍、當時俱被我軍攻破、界涇河水、盡成赤色、羅店全被焚燬、奪獲敵第二十二聯隊軍旗一面、搜獲敵軍重要命令文件甚多、憑某軍官日記內之記戰、激戰十日、每連傷亡、超過半數、</p>
<p>大雨淋漓我軍施威</p>
<p>十六日敵收拾殘餘、以台灣守備隊向羅店增援、再行攻擊、因天氣陰霾、大雨淋漓、敵空軍無法活動、我軍士氣奮發、常以主力由正面逆襲、在南北塘口·東姜宅·及羅店一帶、與敵激戰、囚我步砲兵協同得力、迫擊砲隊發揮偉大威力、攻擊我張家堰之敵一團、立見崩潰、同時我嘉定高射砲及金家灣我陣地前面、各擊落敵轟炸機一架、本日敵死亡奇重、是敵攻擊第二次之頓挫、</p>
<p>激戰六日斃敵逾萬</p>
<p>十七日敵以其所到之一師、加入楊行正面、復作最後之總攻、不惜以密集部隊、向我重疊猛攻、我以機槍掃射、斃敵無算、我陣地屹然未動、適我生力軍趕到、卽由楊木橋金宅及北朱店一帶、加入反攻、向敵猛力掃蕩、至十二時、將敵全部擊潰、十八日晨以來、敵全部向後退卻、楊行·永安橋·金家灣·一帶地區、方圓十餘里、敵尸體遍地皆是、並遺棄軍用品甚多、其狼狽情狀、可以想見、先後計與敵激戰六日、斃敵逾萬、為敵軍第三期總攻慘敗之經過情形、氣燄萬丈之敵軍、士氣大挫、</p>
<h3>敵攻楊木橋遭慘敗</h3>
<p>滬太公路兩邊敵屍山積　斃敵中佐查係廣島師團</p>
<p>今晨接得劉行方面戰報如下、㊀十七日有敵軍三聯隊、向我劉家行東面楊木橋至朝王廟之綫、猛烈砲轟、自下午至黃昏之間、復有步兵一部、向我陣地進攻、我軍立卽奮起、予以逆襲衝鋒、肉搏數次、激戰至當晚十時許、卒將敵軍完全擊潰、沿滬太公路兩旁敵軍、屍如山積、其在小朱宅方面之敵、被我集中砲火、猛力轟擊、損失奇重、自十七晚至十八晨、前綫已歸靜寂、足知敵軍攻勢行動、已完全失敗矣、㊁十七晚劉家行之敵、被我擊斃中佐一名、搜查其身藏之符號、係廣島第五師團之三十四聯隊、又查閱其日記簿上所載、知該部於本月一日到揚子江口、五日登陸、六日在吳淞休息、九日始向楊行劉行方面前進、㊂楊木橋沿公路兩旁、及金家灣附近、敵軍死傷最多、約有一千餘人、並遺棄武器材料甚多、</p>
<h3>敵向北站等處開砲</h3>
<p>泗涇球塲敵三百餘　進犯江灣經我擊退</p>
<p>江灣方面之敵、以援軍開到補充配備、十七日以來、敵蟄伏壕內、未敢潛出、故全綫沉寂、至昨晨五時、敵突向我北站五卅公墓及持志大學各點、以猛烈之砲火不斷射擊、至六時半始止、我工事堅固、絕無損失、而三民路以北李家橋泗涇球塲一帶、有敵三百餘人、向我江灣區陣地進犯、經我迎頭截殺、當將其擊退、</p>
<h3>敵機卅餘架窺浦東</h3>
<p>作無目標之轟擊於我無損</p>
<p>浦東局勞、尚未抵嚴重階段、昨晚浦江日艦畏我空軍轟炸、通宵達旦、陷於紛亂慌急狀態中、故僅派武裝汽艇數艘、往來遊弋、以防我軍乘機襲擊、始終未敢靠近浦東陣線、今晨七時、突有敵方大隊飛機三十餘架、盤旋於其昌棧洋涇一帶上空、擲彈轟炸、我軍卽全綫嚴密戒備、但日機作無目標之轟擊、三十分鐘後、卽四散飛開、至上午九時、虹口一二敵艦、又向浦東各地開砲十餘響、我軍當亦加以還擊、使敵艦感受威脅、不得不迫而停放、故於十時回復平靜、</p>
<h3>浦中敵艦逃往下游</h3>
<p>懼我空軍襲擊</p>
<p>昨日舶浦敵艦、突見增加、共有二十四艘、自一號浮筒至二十浮筒、幾每一浮筒皆有敵艦一艘停泊、但自經我空軍於昨夜數度夜襲後、泊浦敵艦、皆驚恐無已、相率潛逃至楊樹浦以下一帶浦面、而尤以四號浮筒至十號浮筒之敵艦、今晨已逃逸一空、聞其中兩艘、於被我機轟炸受傷後、已逃往淞口一帶修理、</p>
<h3>永清固安激戰我軍奮勇退敵</h3>
<p>涿州城仍由我軍固守　津浦綫姚官屯方面戰事猛烈</p>
<p>［南京］軍息、我軍平漢路正面各軍、連日與敵激戰於房山西北山地、一旦琉璃河永定河沿岸之綫、戰况異常壯烈、永淸固安方面、數次渡河之敵、均為我軍奮勇擊退、敵方傷亡甚衆、現我消耗戰之初步目的已達、乃於十七日晚依照預定計劃、由警戒陣地撤至涿縣以南之旣設陣地、準備與敵决戰、目下我前綫部隊、均已到達預定位置、敵方企圖側襲涿縣、遮斷平漢交通、包圍我涿縣以北作戰軍之計畫、已完全失敗、（十八日中央社電）</p>
<p>［北平］平漢綫戰事、十八日已進展至涿州以南高碑店附近地方、惟涿州城、現仍由華軍固守中、長鄕與涿州間、亦月大隊華軍、仍與日軍抗拒中、（十九日快訊社電）</p>
<p>［濟南］昨夜敵乘我換防、佔據姚官屯、西北高官屯東北梅官屯今早十點起、砲戰大作、竟日未停、敵北發八九百砲、因不准均落站四周空地、僅傷數老百姓、站西北仁和村敵坦克車六輛活動、被我甲車擊退、敵甚懼我發砲準確、站西北四五里李樓敵八十餘人、已被我圍住、敵入民房、正嚴搜、至晚九點戰停、（十九日專電）</p>
<h3>抗日義軍活躍東北局勢緊張</h3>
<p>海龍鐵橋被破壞　日偽軍疲於奔命</p>
<p>［瀋陽］近日來瀋吉綫車時受義軍攻擊、海龍站附近之鐵橋、十七日晚已被義軍破壞、使交通受極大影響、日軍已在該地附近各鄕村標貼告示、警告各鄕民、勿為義軍利用、否則一經發覺、全鄕村將受炸燬、但義軍仍活躍如常、據一般估計、刻在“滿”之日軍約有四十萬人、但皆不如義軍之慣善於遊擊戰、大有疲於奔命之苦、（十九日快訊社電）</p>
<p>［瀋陽］近日來由日韓來“滿”之日本生力軍有如潮湧、可知滿境局勢緊張之一斑、日軍移動往往係在夜間、並嚴守祕密、但據可靠方面傳出消息、近由日開抵滿之日軍、已分向西北部之道安（譯情）及東部之寗塔、等地開㧞、（十九日快訊社電）</p>
<h3>敵機襲太原擊落三架</h3>

<h3>沉痛的回憶（七）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊆敵人鐵蹄下的北平</p>
<p>北平失陷後的十天以內，日軍並沒有進住北平城裹，祇在四郊駐紥着．郡原因，一共有三個：一，津浦·平漢·平绥三綫的戰事，還正在向前發展中，沒有佔到確切的根據地·二，四郊潛伏着許多的冀北保安隊。三，等着看看列强方面的態度。另外，‘地方維持會一諸人，當時也以為他們請日軍不進城的要求，是有力的原因之一，事後證明，那完全是不相干的。</p>
<p>北平失陷之後，北平的一般人們，大概可分為兩類，一類是打算交通一有辦法，立刻就走的；另一類，是走不動，或走出來生活無着，祇好聽大山命的。至於政治上的什麽“會”什麽‘處之類，反正全是漢奸和準漢奸們的勾當，大家並不注意。而且，那是混亂的期間，一個日本浪人，可以收買一批中國漢奸，來個什麼處’發發宣言，幾個中國人志在當漢奸的脚色，也可以來個什麼‘會’，請請願。而實際，這全是不確定的，將來日軍正式着手偽組織時，到底怎麼弄，還不知道。所以，那時的北平局面，祇可以算是各種漢奸在競爭的時期，沒有注意的必要，至於他們的醜態，在上面，記者已經約略述過了。</p>
<p>北平有一百五十三萬人口。這些人，如果全體能走得動，有辦注走，而且，走出來生活有着落的話，我想，除去極少的漢奸而外，沒有不走開的。其實，就一般人說，在北平住下去，大危險倒也沒有；然而，却沒有一個不想即刻就走開；誰也撇不住那口悶氣！這裹，證明着申國民族確是覺醒了。八月五號試車，六號正式通車。東車站乘客的擁擠，為歷來所未見過。每天到天津去的，練在兩三千以上．開始的幾天，日本方面說：這批走的人，不是藍衣社，就是共產黨，因為懼怕‘皇軍’，所以逃了。那口吻，似乎很高與大家定的。後來，越走越多，北平大有成為空城的趨勢了，於是連日方也慌了起來；所以在站上，就往往向乘客們提出‘為麼要走’？的問題。有些因為答得不確當，已經到天津了，卻又被押送回平，强制留住。</p>
<p>市面方面，一切店鋪，因為警察局有命令，强迫着開門，連報閉歇都不准，於是，每天不得不勉强開門；然而，大都是門可羅雀”。為了‘繁榮市面’起見，偽市政府把娛樂捐完豁全免一月，強迫各娛樂場所，照常營業；但一方面因為顧客非常稀少，另一方面電影院還不到新片子，戲院也請不到名角，所以也都萧條得很。住家戶，終天閉着大門，不敢外出；自偽當局宣佈了嚴密檢查戶口辦法以後，就更加具了戒心，時時刻刻地，担心着那說不定什麼時候就會突然光臨的惡運。</p>
<p>偽警察局長潘毓桂曾經發表過談話，有四種人是不受保護的：㊀中央直屬機關的人員，㊁文化界人士，㊂共產黨，㊃藍衣社分子。他這話裹面所指的可算包括了北平人口的很长一部，其用意，就是在於驅逐這一大批人離開北平，於是，謠言起來了：某方在打算捕某人了，某方在打算檢會某學校了，…等等。於是，各大學敎授，各大學學生，以及各種文化界人士，全都紛紛地化了裝，向天津逃跑。教授裹面，比較著各的，比較為日方及漢奸們忌視的人物，這時候，大半在廬山參加中央召集的談話會，這可算是一件幸事；不然的話，像蔣夢麟，胡適之，顧頡剛等氏，素來被日方視為排日，被漢奸視為‘中央派一的，這時，恐怕就很危險了。學校方面，四個國立大學以及各私立院校，並沒有什麼破壤，仍舊由原來的負責人暫時維持。畢業肄業的學生，全都分別發了畢業證明書和肄業證明書。四個國立大學的教職員工友的薪資，七月份完全由學校先行在存款下墊發，因為平津院校的每月三十六萬費，七月份的，始終沒有匯到。各學校大多在南京設了通訊處；北平校裹留存的人，看起來，是在辦結束了。各校的圖書儀器，除去很久以煎，還出小部份外，大半全沒有運走。二十九軍撤退得那麼快，大家於什麼準備也沒有的狀况下，一下子落在敵人生裹，這是非常可痛心的事！偽當局已經表示過，一切圖書儀器，總絕對禁止遷運了。文化界裹，最狼狽，最危險，同時也最令人啼笑不得的，要算新聞界了。新聞界是消息最靈通的人，而這回，却也於糊糊塗塗的狀况下，落到了敵人手裹。除去平素和方及某方有拉攏的而外，那共餘，都有着很大的被捕危險性，實際呢，也的確有些是被敵人拘去了，我離開北平時，還一直不知道他們怎麼下落。上面述的，是光明的一面；但在黑暗的另一面，却也有些舉措，是應當在這裹約略述一述的。學校方面，聽說偽當局也在計劃着辦一个大學，記者離開時，似乎他們還沒有成議，不知現在怎樣了。中小學，一律照舊，由偽當局繼續開辦。不過，敎科書的修改，是不用說的；其次，偽當局並曾下了命令，不准再授那些‘不必要’的課程了。他們的意思，大概是指的黨義，公民等類的課程。報紙呢，日人辦的，和漢奸的，除原有的仍然繼續外，交出了些新的，（他們是不受紙張缺乏的影響的，因為可以從日本運紙，所以還是原來的篇幅。）此外，北平其他各報，也還是大多數在出版，不過內容完全變了，主持人也大半換了。</p>
<p>直接受到敵軍燒殺的是四郊。記者在十號下午，曾經冒險坐一位美國人的車子，到西郊去。沿途十多里，不斷地，有屍首的臭气吹來。那個汽車夫，一邊開車，一邊指點着路兩旁不斷看到的新土堆子，告訴我們那裹面埋着人的姓名。這條路，他常走的，所以，死的也全是他的熟人。新𤩳是紅十字會埋的。</p>
<p>逃開北平後，到現在，已經許多天了。近來的詳細情况，是不知道的；然而，有一點我却可以斷定：那些逃不出的同胞，一定終天在盼望着重睹靑天白日旗！</p>
<h3>日本政界惑星‘宇垣一成’（上）</h3>
<p>— 斐丹</p>
<p>近五年来，日本的政局一有風浪，於去年才退職的前朝鮮總督，政界惑星，陸軍大將從一位動二等功三級的宇垣一成的名字，立刻就會浮顯於日本一般人的腦膜，而宇垣行將組織新閣的謠傳，立刻卹傳佈開來；即使政局平靜無事，如果這位總督渡過對馬海峽，從朝鮮跑回東京，也立刻會發生政局動搖的風說。但是五年來，日本發生了五次政變，首相的衣砵出蕭藤傳給岡田廣田林近衛，而沒有輪到宇垣，雖然今春廣田辭職之後，宇垣曾一度奉命組織，但因軍部少壯的反對，使宇垣有志難成。宇垣因為組閣未成，至為憤恨，以為以陸軍大將而遭軍部的反對，已失去了統御軍隊的資格，於是就向天皇辭去了陸軍大將的頭銜，解甲歸農去了。</p>
<p>可是這次我國對日全面抗戰發生以後，又發生了宇垣為日軍統帥的消鳥；不料這個消息尚未證實，現在又傳宇垣於日前遭暗殺了。宇垣是否眞遭暗殺，現在雖然不得而知，但宇垣久為少壯派軍人所忌，他的遭暗殺，是很可能的；我想大家定在想，日本的少壯派軍人，為什麽要这樣地痛恨宇垣呢？</p>
<p>在說少壮倣軍人痛恨字輝的原因之先，我先來說一說宇垣的簡史。宇垣出世之初，是畢業於岡山師範學校，做月薪—六元的窮小學教員，後來終於棄文習武，考進了志願所在的陸軍士官學校，於一八九○年畢業於該校，第二年就任少尉軍官，在同年進了日本陸軍大臣登龍必經的陸軍大学之門。陸軍大學畢業之後，就任駐德武官，回國後就任參謀本部附，軍事課長，參謀本部總務部長，陸軍大學校長，第十師團長，陸軍次官等職。一九三四年由田中的推薦，任淸浦內閣的陸相，以後在加藤第一次，第二次內閣，若槻濱口等內閣繼續歴任陸相。一九三一年，濱口被刺，才辭去陸相之職，到朝鮮去做總督，一直做了五年，到去年八月才掛冠回東京，由此我們可以知道宇垣以住所過的，是一帆風順的生涯。</p>
<p>向來日本的陸相，是由軍部自已推薦的，在昔日為軍部所擁戴的宇垣，為什麼今日却為軍部自己所反對呢？這是一般人所大惑不解，亦是宇垣州之所以為政界惑星的原因。究極的說，這不能不說是時勢了。因為少壯派反對宇垣的理由，說來雖然很多，但是主要的可說有二點，第一宇垣出資陸軍，第二宇垣與旣成政黨財閥的關係太深。這兩件事，完全是時勢使然的。</p>
<p>先說少壯派所說的宇垣出資陸軍，是因為宇垣附䢫政黨主張．實行縮軍。因為宇垣出任陸相的時候，是在世界大戰之後不久，和平縮軍的空氣，彌漫全球，日本的議會也受這種和平氣流的衝擊，而主張縮軍極烈。宇垣也不得不順從時勢而把日本的陸軍，山二十一個師團，縮减為十七個師團。原來日本軍備的理想標準，是陸軍二十五個師團，海軍五十萬噸，歷代的軍部大臣，都把他看作金科玉律，宇垣縮軍的舉動，當然要使陸軍中的保守派驚奇。同時縮軍的結果，許多軍官陷於失業，流離失所。他們的痛恨宇垣，是不言可知。但實際上，宇垣向來主張擴軍的，從前西園寺內閣時，他是當時陸軍省的軍事課長，極力主張增加陸軍二師團：到了宇垣任陸相的時候，時勢已完全變了，不僅和平縮軍運動極為熾烈，而且由世界大戰的經驗，知道將來的戰爭，不僅在於軍隊人數的多寡，軍器裝備的優劣，尤為重要，在當時縮軍空氣極為濃厚的時候，要軍費不减縮，已是不客易、要其增加，實在非常困難，在此種情况之下，宇垣只得以同额的軍費，由縮編四個師團，以所節省下來　經費，充實軍備。宇垣的用心，雖然未可厚非，但是有誰諒解他呢？結果是給反對他的野心家以利用的機會，而給他戴上一頂出賣陸軍的帽子。出賣陸軍的帽子，使宇垣失去靑年將校的信仰，使靑年將校　怨恨都集中在他的身上。</p>
<h3>今日中秋各業穩渡節關</h3>
<p>客賬收取什九轉賬　市場洋拆依然兩角</p>
<p>今日為各業中秋結賬節、各錢莊公司工廠商號、均於十五日起、對各往來戶發給淸單、今日起，已派員分別照常催收賬款、‘對於戰區之往來戶、因地址不明，均採用登報辦法、通告各戶，應顧全商業信用、將賬款自動送往、但際此非常時期，收賬頗覺困難、十之八九轉賬而已，中中交農四銀行、為穩定金融、調劑各業起見、以前成立之拆放委員會、均儘量辦理拆放、銀錢兩業同業公會所屬之準備機關、對於會員行莊、亦竭力調劑，間接亦為救濟工商業、所以滬市金融、尚稱穩定、市埸洋拆、依然二角</p>

<p>存煤總約二十萬噸　柴炭照常裝船運滬</p>
<p>上海市政府、對於燃料之供給、頗為重視、已由公安祉會等局、合組燃料委員會、辦理燃料之供給、記者昨向關係方面探悉、滬市存煤、總約二十餘萬噸、以煙煤為大宗、白煤次之、今因虹口閘北南市浦東竿處、工廠均已停歇、租界內工廠、開工者寥寥、所以需煤較前大减、目前存煤足能維持三四個月、至開灤煤礦公司秦皇鳥所產之煤、照常裝英輪駛滬、同時柴炭燃料、由內河民船裝運來滬、所以滬市燃料、决無缺乏之虞、</p>

<h3>The Enemy Warships on the Whangpoo Are Uneasy All Night - Our Air Force Successfully Bombs Them on a Moonlit Night</h3>
<p>Enemy positions in Hongkew are hit in many places and set ablaze. Two enemy warships are damaged and three enemy planes are shot down. Our forces in Pudong simultaneously support the battle with heavy artillery.</p>
<p>This newspaper received the following confirmed report from the front lines at 2:00 AM this morning: A. Luodian Area: (1) Since dawn yesterday, approximately three regiments of enemy troops, under the cover of airplanes and tanks, launched a fierce three-pronged attack against us. One route was from south of Gujiage, attacking Beizhujiazhai. Another route was from Xujiage, attacking Xuzhai and both Nantungkou. The last route was from Wudoujing, attacking Tuzhuyuan. The enemy in the Beizhudian area was attacked from the side by our [censored] army's [censored] brigade. The enemy troops could not withstand the attack, and retreated in disarray. One enemy plane was shot down and three enemy tanks were destroyed. Approximately two thousand enemy troops in front of Nantungkou and Tuzhuyuan launched a fierce attack last night against our Xiezhai and Jinzhai lines. Our [censored] division's [censored] regiment suffered heavy casualties, resulting in the enemy seizing the Jinzhai and Xiezhai positions. Although our troops fought bravely in close combat and pushed forward vigorously, briefly recapturing the positions, they had to temporarily withdraw due to overwhelming enemy firepower. (2) Yesterday afternoon, several enemy planes circled over Jiading, attempting to bomb the area. One plane was shot down by our dense anti-aircraft fire. At the same time, our [censored] division also shot down an enemy plane near Daqiaotou. B. Shanghai Area: (1) The enemies north of Sanmin Road, in the areas of Lijiaqiao and Sijing Golf Course, all speak with a Northeastern accent, and the bullets they are using are all dumdum bullets. (2) From 7:00 PM last night until 2:00 AM this morning, our air force continuously flew over the Whangpoo River and enemy positions in Hongkew, bombing them repeatedly. Every bomb hit its target. At the same time, our artillery positions in Pudong also launched a fierce bombardment. All of our citizens were extremely excited.</p>

<p>Repeated attacks left the enemy in a panic. Stray bullets flew during the aerial battle. Bombs dropped near the Wayside Wharf and other areas. All of our citizens were extremely excited.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM last night, our air force, in the bright moonlight and starlight, suddenly appeared over the enemy warships on the Whangpoo River and the enemy military positions in the eastern part of Shanghai. Immediately, the enemy's red, green, and white signal flares danced in the sky. At the same time, searchlights and sea-searching lights on the enemy warships turned on, shining brightly into the sky like long rainbows. The enemy's anti-aircraft guns and machine guns fired continuously. Simultaneously, the loud explosions of the large number of bombs dropped by our air force began. After about half an hour, everything became quiet. At 8:25 PM, our air force attacked again. Even when the sound of the planes was still far away, the enemy's anti-aircraft guns fired randomly into the sky. Our planes dropped four bombs, and two fires started near the enemy bases of Hongkew's Wayside Wharf and Osaka Wharf. At the same time, many ambulances from the Special District rushed to provide aid. The enemy suffered quite a few deaths and injuries. At 8:45 PM, the enemy air force flew from the temporary enemy airfield near the Yangshupu Public University Textile Factory to provide support. Immediately, the most intense aerial night battle since the outbreak of the Shanghai War occurred over the Whangpoo River. The clear sound of machine guns from both sides filled the air. The fierce battle lasted for twenty minutes before stopping. After 11:25 PM, our air force attacked several times, causing the enemy to respond in a panic, with the sound of anti-aircraft guns like drums. In addition to dropping bombs, our planes also used intense machine-gun fire to strafe downward. All of our citizens, on this painful anniversary night of September 18th, witnessed our air force bravely killing the enemy and expressed extreme excitement. Xia Xiaochen, a sixteen-year-old apprentice from Zhenjiang at the Huadong Leather Shoe Company at No. 13 Jinli on the southern end of Sanma Road, went to bed at 9:00 PM last night. His bedroom was on the fourth floor, when suddenly at 11:30 PM, he was severely wounded by a stray bullet. The bullet pierced through the roof, leaving a very small hole. It appeared to be a machine-gun bullet that went through his right chest and out his back, causing a lot of bleeding. He was immediately taken by car to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was the sixth anniversary of the fall of our four Northeastern provinces into enemy hands. During these six years, our government has endured humiliation and worked hard to prepare, and the establishment of a powerful air force can be considered a great achievement. Recently, it has been unusually active in Shanghai and North China, posing a great threat to the enemy. Last night was the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, with a bright and clean moon and a sky as blue as water. Our air force again flew to Shanghai to attack the enemy at night, bombing them severely. At around 7:00 PM that evening, a squadron of our bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, appeared over Shanghai. The enemy warships in the Whangpoo River hurriedly fired anti-aircraft guns and machine guns randomly. Our planes calmly flew over the Whangpoo River and went straight to Songkou to bomb the enemy warships. They then returned to Shanghai at 7:30 PM, circling over Hongkew, Yangshupu, and the Whangpoo River. The enemy warships fired anti-aircraft guns and machine guns densely. Our air force officers and soldiers were extremely brave, tumbling up and down in the gunfire, dropping many bombs. They returned to Songkou at 8:50 PM to bomb the enemy warships again. At 11:20 PM, they flew over Shanghai again to bomb the enemy warships and positions. They safely left Shanghai and returned at 12:30 AM this morning. Our air force's night raid on Shanghai was very successful. Many bombs were dropped on the enemy positions in Hongkew and Yangshupu, causing four fires. The enemy suffered great damage. At 8:15 PM, when the enemy warships were focusing on another of our planes in the southeast sky, one of our planes flew from the northwest corner and dropped a bomb, hitting an enemy warship berthed at the northern wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The ship was severely damaged. Our plane immediately rose into the clouds. Although other enemy warships fired anti-aircraft guns in pursuit, there was no damage. When our planes circled overhead, the enemy warships illuminated them with sea-searching lights. Our artillery positions in Pudong used the lights as targets and fired artillery shells. Another enemy warship was hit and severely damaged. Last night, there were many fragments of anti-aircraft shells and stray bullets from anti-aircraft machine guns falling within the concessions, resulting in many deaths and injuries.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Withdraw from Luodian Town</h3>
<p>The current guard line is holding against the enemy. Our front-line fortifications have been completely destroyed. The enemy's advance on Xiaotangzi was repelled.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy troops in the Luodian area have been fiercely attacking our positions since the 13th, attempting to threaten our positions in the Liuhe area. We have been bravely resisting them, and fierce fighting continues. Luodian Town has been turned into scorched earth by the concentrated bombing of enemy planes and artillery, but our troops are still holding on desperately. The town was lost once on the 14th, but recaptured in a counterattack at midnight the next day. After several more losses and recaptures, the enemy, having suffered heavy losses, bombarded us with artillery barrages for several hours each day. Our front-line fortifications were completely destroyed, forcing us to withdraw again the night before last. We are now holding the Qianjiacun and Qianwangzhai areas, 2,000 meters from the Luodian-Dachang highway, with a guard line in front of the first defense line, holding against the enemy. Yesterday, the enemy advanced on our positions in Xiaotangzi, southwest of Luodian, but was repelled by our troops. In the Luodian area, the entire front line has been in fierce combat for three days. Since our troops recovered the town on the 15th, the enemy, having suffered heavy losses, has urgently redeployed reinforcements and launched fierce counterattacks one after another. The fierce fighting only paused slightly during heavy rain. East of Luodian, the two battles at Beizhudian and Houjiazhai on our left flank were the targets of the enemy's offensive. Artillery fire was concentrated in these areas. In addition to artillery, several enemy planes circled over our positions, and infantry advanced under their cover. Our troops fiercely resisted, advancing wave after wave, fighting in bloody battles until the evening before last, when our troops changed their lines and held the Wangzhai, Lizhai, and Youmeizhai lines, holding against the enemy. South of Luodian, on our right flank, the enemy also launched a fierce attack on our Nantungkou line, concentrating artillery fire and bombarding us for several hours. They then sent more than 2,000 infantry troops, under the cover of tanks, from Zhangzhai towards our Qianzhai area. Our soldiers held their ground firmly. However, due to the ferocity of the enemy, they were able to invade our area briefly. Although our troops bravely recovered the position, enemy troops were discovered again near Gongjiazhai, Jinzhai, and Qianzhai. Our troops then firmly held the east-west Sutang and Zhoujiazhai-Ximazhai lines, engaging the enemy in fierce combat. Enemy troops also appeared in front of our Xiaotangzi position near Luodian and launched a surprise attack. Our troops fought fiercely against the enemy, relying on the river. Some of the invading enemies were killed, while the rest retreated in defeat. The entire front line is still in fierce combat.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Liuhang Was Repelled with Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>We recovered the Yangmuqiao position and advanced north. Fierce fighting is ongoing in the Doujialong and Mengwan areas.</p>
<p>The fighting on the Liuhang front line has been extremely intense for days. At dawn the day before yesterday, the enemy concentrated fierce artillery fire on our positions from Yangmuqiao to Chaowangmiao. Yangmuqiao is located between Yong'anqiao and Liuhang, and the enemy fired more than a thousand shells. The enemy temporarily broke through our Yangmuqiao position. After a bloody battle until the afternoon, our troops rose up in a counterattack, advancing forward and engaging the enemy in a desperate close combat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and collapsed in defeat. Our troops then completely recovered the Yangmuqiao position, expanded northward, and advanced to Jinjiawan and Zhangzhai. In the evening, the retreating enemy was reinforced, and about 3,000 troops from three regiments attacked us again. Our troops rose up to meet them, and after a bloody battle throughout the night, they defeated the enemy. The enemy's ambitions were not dead, and yesterday they continued to attack our positions, and the enemy artillery fiercely bombarded us. Our artillery immediately returned fire. From morning to night yesterday, our troops engaged the enemy in fierce combat in the Doujialong and Mengwan areas, and the battle stalemated. There were no changes to our positions.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 18th, the enemy troops attacking along both sides of the Liuhang highway launched a fierce attack on the evening of the 17th, but were bravely repelled by our troops, who took the opportunity to counterattack and recapture several villages. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, leaving behind six to seven hundred corpses. One of their battalion commanders was killed, and one regimental flag was captured. Fearing our detailed attack, the enemy did not stop firing artillery throughout the night. In addition, the enemy's attacks have been thwarted for several days, and due to heavy casualties, their morale is low. Therefore, the front line was quiet on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Fiercely Bombards Enemy Positions</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, from the evening of the day before yesterday (the 17th) until dawn yesterday, the enemy intermittently bombarded our rear positions in Zhabei, attempting to disrupt them. In retaliation, our artillery positions in Zhabei and Pudong simultaneously opened fire at 6:30 AM yesterday, fiercely bombarding enemy positions in Hongkew and Yangshupu. The sound of the artillery was deafening and shook the entire city. The enemy Marine Corps headquarters on North Sichuan Road and its surrounding area were hit by several of our shells. At around 8:00 AM, our artillery positions in Jiangwan also bombarded the enemy with heavy artillery. Several fires broke out in the enemy positions in Hongkew and Yangshupu, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Although the enemy artillery also returned fire, it was aimless, and our troops suffered no losses. At around 10:00 AM, the sound of artillery gradually subsided.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Victorious at the Xiajiazhaibridge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the front line in Jiangwan was very quiet. Apart from one artillery battle in the morning, there were no major battles throughout the day. However, between Xiajiazhaibridge and Tangjiazhai, our troops feigned a crossing of a small creek. The enemy, seeing our troops attempting to cross, opened fire. We detected that the enemy was prepared on that line, but there was little preparation on the north bank of Xiajiazhaibridge. We immediately concentrated our forces and attacked. A small number of enemy troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. We then recaptured the area.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Zhabei Was Again Repelled</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 PM last night, the enemy troops advanced on our positions in Zhabei. Our troops calmly responded and waited for the enemy to approach before firing machine guns densely and attacking with hand grenades. After an hour and a half of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray. Our troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, advancing as far as North Sichuan Road. However, since there were no defensive fortifications to hold, we retreated to our original positions.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Chihchih University Was Crushed by Us</h3>
<p>Our troops advanced 300 meters.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, enemy troops advanced on our positions near Chihchih University. Our troops bravely met them, waiting for the enemy to approach before charging out of the trenches and engaging them in close combat. The enemy troops could not withstand the attack and retreated in defeat. Our troops took advantage of the victory to pursue, advancing 300 meters.</p>
<p>Another report states that the enemy on North Sichuan Road, under the cover of artillery fire yesterday evening, concentrated their forces and launched a fierce attack on our North Railway Station. Our troops bravely met them, and after a fierce battle throughout the night, the enemy troops retreated with heavy casualties at around 6:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Attempt to Land in Pudong Was Repelled by Us</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, an enemy gunboat suddenly sailed from the Wusong area to the waters off the Bund Park, then slowly sailed towards the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, without firing any shots. At the same time, two small motorboats full of enemy soldiers sped to the same location, intending to land. Our Pudong defenders initially ignored them, waiting for the enemy ships to approach before strafing them with dense machine-gun fire. The enemy, realizing that we were prepared, hurriedly returned fire with machine guns. The enemy motorboats took the opportunity to retreat first, while the enemy warship, still unwilling to show weakness, fired machine guns at our Pudong positions for more than half an hour. After our Pudong artillery positions bombarded the enemy with artillery fire, the warship hurriedly fled at around 7:00 AM.</p>
<h3>The Number of Enemy Warships Moored in the Whangpoo Suddenly Increased Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the number of enemy warships moored in the Whangpoo suddenly increased yesterday, and the frequency of their movements was unprecedented. A total of three enemy gunboats, four destroyers, and one transport ship sailed out at 6:10 AM, 7:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:10 PM, 4:00 PM, 4:30 PM, and 5:30 PM. A total of one enemy gunboat, three destroyers, and two transport ships sailed in at 6:50 AM, 9:20 AM, 9:50 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM, and 12:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, another enemy gunboat and a destroyer suddenly sailed and berthed in the waters off the City Ferry Terminal. The enemy soldiers on board used telescopes to observe our Pudong from afar for a long time before leaving, suggesting that they had some intentions towards our Pudong. The investigation of the enemy warships' mooring situation yesterday is as follows: No. 1 Buoy: Destroyer No. 11, No. 2 Buoy: Flagship Izumo, No. 3 Buoy: Destroyer No. 21, No. 4 Buoy: Destroyer No. 1, No. 5 Buoy: Ryoyo Maru, No. 5 Yunhai Maru, No. 7 Buoy: Chiyo Maru, No. 8 Buoy: Destroyer, No. 11 Buoy: Two gunboats, No. 9, No. 13, No. 14, No. 15, No. 16, No. 22, No. 27, No. 30 Buoy: One gunboat each, No. 17, No. 35, No. 40 Buoy: One destroyer each, Osaka Wharf: First Yunhai Maru, Huangpu Wharf: Chida Maru, China Merchants Middle Wharf: Unnamed transport ship.

<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Kuilei Lake in Kunshan</h3>
<p>Enemy planes dropped several bombs on Hongqiao Airport again. Another civilian ship was sunk in Beixinjing.</p>
<p>A person from Kunshan reported that several enemy planes flew west in the dark at around 0:00 AM the other day. When they passed seventeen or eighteen li northwest of Kunshan City, they saw a few stars flickering. They immediately dropped several bombs, but they did not explode. Then, they repeatedly searched with flares, only to find a vast expanse of water with three or five fishing boats, lit up for fishing. The bombs were dropped into the water. The enemy planes dropping bombs without a target is truly laughable. The area is Kuilei Lake, a branch of Yangcheng Lake.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, four enemy planes flew to western Shanghai and bombed our Hongqiao Airport, dropping a total of seven bombs. Four bombs landed inside the airport and three bombs landed outside the airport, all of which exploded, causing no losses to our side. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, enemy planes dropped bombs in the Beixinjing and Yujidun areas in northwestern Shanghai. It is reported that one refugee ship was sunk, and the number of casualties is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>No Enemy Building Airfield at Hengsha</h3>
<p>It was previously reported that the enemy was building an airfield in Hengsha, which is under the jurisdiction of Chuansha County. However, according to passengers from Hengsha yesterday, the island is located opposite Chuansha, separated by the sea. One or two days after the outbreak of the war, seven or eight enemy soldiers landed by small boat after a detour. Later, seeing that the roads were rugged and the waterways were winding, they realized that it was unsuitable for their purposes and retreated. There have been no signs of the enemy since then. The most pitiful thing is that the food supply for 17,000 people is running out and needs to be replenished.</p>
<h3>Four Enemy Transport Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, from before dawn to noon yesterday (the 18th), four enemy transport ships arrived in Shanghai: (1) Ryota Maru (No. 11), fully loaded with gasoline, diesel, etc., berthed at Buoy No. 5; (2) First Yunhai Maru (No. 51), fully loaded with military vehicles, tanks, armored vehicles, etc., docked at Osaka Wharf; (3) Chida Maru (No. 59), fully loaded with military supplies and ammunition, docked at Huangpu Wharf; (4) One unnamed transport ship, fully loaded with approximately 1,000 enemy reinforcements, docked at the China Merchants Middle Wharf and landed immediately. The ammunition and military supplies from the other ships were being unloaded continuously. There were 40 to 50 enemy soldiers at each wharf carrying goods into trucks and driving them away. As of yesterday, the Ikuta Maru and Chiyo Maru, which had arrived in Shanghai, were berthed at Buoys No. 7 and 5, respectively, while the Fifth Yunhai Maru (No. 166), which had arrived in Shanghai four days earlier, was berthed in Buoy No. 5.</p>
<h3>The Korean People Living Under the Iron Heel - National Humiliation and Hatred</h3>
<p>They have accumulated bitterness for thirty years and are willing to be shattered jade rather than whole tiles. They are reducing their food to comfort our troops and rise up together to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, in addition to awakening all Koreans in Shanghai to join the movement to restore their country, and in ardent sympathy for our soldiers resisting the enemy, all Koreans in Shanghai, living in exile, are tightening their belts and reducing their food consumption, even pawning their belongings to raise 121.30 yuan to send to the Shanghai Comfort Committee for the purpose of sewing cotton vests, to express their condolences. The Koreans' enthusiasm is such that they hope all our compatriots in the city will rise up together to sew one million vests in the near future and send them to the front lines for use. The original letter is excerpted below: Dear Sirs, our Korean people have suffered the tragedy of national subjugation for more than thirty years. During this period, we have lived under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism every day. The pain we have suffered cannot be described in words. Restrictions on our actions, suppression of our thoughts, and the insufficiency of subjugated countries have led to the desire to exterminate our race. Therefore, all our compatriots with a little knowledge and awareness have been forced into exile overseas. Losing both the country and the home, how heartbreaking is this? Fortunately, the human heart has not died, and the determination to avenge our country and restore our nation has not been forgotten. Therefore, we have struggled with the violent Japanese for years, with countless people sacrificing themselves heroically, like a raging tide that cannot be stopped. Since the start of the anti-Japanese war at Lugouqiao to the current Shanghai War, it has aroused unparalleled frenzy among our Korean people. We hate that we cannot sleep on the Japanese devils' skin and eat their flesh. This is truly caused by the inhumane oppression we have suffered daily. The accumulated hatred of more than thirty years is extremely eager to be vented. In addition to awakening the Korean nation at home and abroad to unite as one, we are willing to be shattered jade rather than whole tiles. We, the Korean residents in Shanghai, are tightening our belts and reducing our food consumption, or pawning our clothes to scrape together 121.30 yuan, which is sent to your committee for delivery to the soldiers resisting the enemy on the front lines, as a token of condolences. Although the amount is small, it shows our united enthusiasm for resisting the enemy. In the future, we will continue to collect funds and gather strength, little by little. Unfortunately, the Korean residents in Shanghai are all exiles who suffer from unemployment and live a difficult life, especially during this time of war. We hope that you will understand and convey this intention to your compatriots, to express the solidarity of the Korean and Chinese peoples in fighting together. We sincerely wish you victory in resisting the enemy. Respectfully presented by the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Korean National Revolutionary Party.</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds "September 18th" Memorial Meeting</h3>
<p>Also Holds Anti-Aggression and Self-Defense Oath; Chairman Wang Reports His Determination to Die</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held a "September 18th" 6th Anniversary Memorial Meeting on the morning of the 18th. All staff members of the department also held an anti-aggression and self-defense oath, which was supervised by Committee Member Wang Zhaoming. The ceremony was extremely solemn. After the ceremony, Wang gave a report, the original text of which is as follows: "Comrades, since we lost the Northeast on September 18, 1931, it has been six years. Not only have we failed to recover the lost territory, but we have continued to lose territory. Thinking about it, we are truly guilty of deserving death. We know that one death is not enough to atone for our sins. Therefore, for the past six years, under the guidance of the Supreme Commander, we have worked hard with one heart and one mind. As soon as the final beginning arrives, we will immediately use everything we have gained from six years of hard work. In other words, we have long since made up our minds to die. What we hope for and what we demand is to exchange our deaths for the survival of the nation. A few days ago, the Central Government issued an order in response to the martyrdom of the entire regiment of soldiers in Nankou and the entire battalion of soldiers in Baoshan, requiring us to seek the final victory with the determination to die. Today, we stand before the portrait of the Premier to take such a solemn oath, which proves that we are of one mind and one heart and will seek the final victory with the determination to die. What is the final victory? It is the survival of the nation. We know that we cannot achieve the final victory without the determination to die. Armed comrades, once we receive an order, we will advance. If we do not receive an order, we will not retreat. The world only has armies that are completely defeated due to preserving their strength. As for those who bravely sacrifice themselves, the greater the sacrifice, the greater the strength. Compatriots in areas not yet occupied by the enemy should exert all their efforts to resist the enemy. In areas that have already been occupied by the enemy, they should exert all their efforts to sabotage and harass the enemy. The world only has compliant people who will become slaves of a conquered nation. Slaves will sacrifice the nation for their own survival. Otherwise, they will be righteous people. Although the enemy may have occupied our territory by chance, if they encounter sabotage and harassment everywhere, they will eventually leave in disarray. This is exchanging one's own death for the survival of the nation. This is the most resolute determination shared by all compatriots and all party comrades in today's most tragic circumstances."

<h3>Japan's Hopes for Future Development in the Chinese Market are Desperate</h3>
<p>This August's Trade Volume with Us is Only One-Quarter of What it Was at the Same Time Last Year</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale invasion of our country, in addition to extorting over 2.6 billion yuan in direct military expenses from their citizens, they have also had to abandon investments worth over 2 billion yuan in various businesses operated in our country for decades. More importantly, Japan's hopes for future development in the Chinese commodity market can be said to be completely desperate. According to the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Japan's total export trade to our country in August this year was only 31.81 million yuan, only a quarter of the 121.67 million yuan in the same period last year. By region, North China was 45.55 million yuan in August last year, compared to 15.64 million yuan in August this year. Central China was 71.96 million yuan in August last year, compared to 15.81 million yuan in the same period this year. South China was 4.16 million yuan in August last year, compared to only 360,000 yuan in the same period this year. There are no trade reports for this month. Except for North China, the markets in Central and South China have completely disappeared. At the same time, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 8th of this month, Japanese traders trading with China have an estimated 36 million yuan worth of goods intended for sale in our country that are piled up domestically due to military impacts and cannot be disposed of. Among them, textile industrial products are worth about 28 million yuan, food is about 2 million yuan, machinery, equipment, and vehicles are about 2 million yuan, chemical industrial products are about 1 million yuan, and other miscellaneous items are about 3 million yuan. With such significant sacrifices of the people, to fill the insatiable desires of the warlords, it is no wonder that the Japanese people are filled with complaints.

<h3>Local Associations Collect Comfort Items on Behalf of the Public</h3>
<p>Recently, there is an urgent need for cotton clothing and dry rations for the resistance troops at the front.

The Local Association has also specially set up a collection point at the Dahua Ballroom at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Bellesme to collect and send items on behalf of the public. However, it is best to make cotton clothing using dark-colored cloth into front-buttoned cotton vests. Dry rations can be made on behalf of the public at Guanshengyuan and Qin Kang companies, and orders can be handed over to the collection point for pick-up on their behalf, which is more convenient.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Ban on US Ships Transporting Munitions to Our Country Deemed Unsatisfactory</h3>
<p>Ambassador Wang Relays Concerns to US State Department; American Newspapers Also Consider the Move Unfair</p>
<p>[Nanjing] President Roosevelt of the United States recently ordered a ban on US government ships transporting arms to China and Japan. The vessel Vicksburg has already halted its voyage mid-route in compliance with the order. While this move by the US government may appear impartial on the surface towards both China and Japan, in reality, it is detrimental to China and beneficial to Japan. This is because the ban only applies to ships owned by the US government, with commercial vessels not subject to the prohibition. Moreover, considering the current state of naval defense and shipping in China and Japan, it is more convenient and safer to transport arms to Japan via commercial vessels than to China. Therefore, our country, engaged in a war of resistance against aggression, cannot feel satisfied with this ban. According to diplomatic sources, our Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, solemnly conveyed to the US State Department on the 17th the reasons why our government and people are dissatisfied with the aforementioned ban by the US government. However, reports from foreign news agencies that Ambassador Wang lodged a protest with the US government are not factual. (Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, lodged a protest today with Secretary of State Hull regarding the US ban on ships carrying munitions. Hull declined to express an opinion on the matter, only acknowledging that the protest had been received. He stated that President Roosevelt's intentions were clear. Personnel from the Chinese Embassy stated that they had not received special instructions from the National Government regarding the protest. A telegram from Nanjing stated that the US President's ban had caused great unease in China, as it substantially hindered China and benefited Japan. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>[New York] Today's editorial in the New York Daily News criticized the US government's policy of banning arms shipments to the Far East. It stated, "If we consider the number of Americans who sympathize with China, it is likely over 95 percent. From what we can observe, even if Japan does not want to completely conquer China at present, it will inevitably seize a large part of it. Therefore, most Americans will likely regret President Roosevelt's ban on arms shipments to the Far East, as the result of this move will not only be detrimental to China but also only benefit Japan. Furthermore, after Japan conquers China, it will inevitably turn its aggressive attention to countries such as Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and France. Therefore, adopting such a policy that aids the aggressor is extremely lacking in common sense." (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>[New York] Regarding the League of Nations Advisory Committee's handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute and its invitation for the United States to participate again, the New York Times recently published an editorial, stating briefly, "The Committee will not make drastic decisions. The US government should at least participate as an observer." The committee, established in 1933, has been inactive for four years. Its revival is welcomed by China. If the United States refuses to participate, it would be seen as a moral victory for Japan, especially given that the US government's recent ban on its ships transporting arms and military supplies to the Far East has already exclusively benefited Japan.

<h3>The Wartime Populace</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>— Conversation with a High-Ranking Commander</p>
<p>(Special Report) Continuous days of rain are quite depressing. But once you reach the front lines and see the spirited and valiant soldiers, their energy like dragons and tigers, you cannot help but feel instantly excited. Yesterday afternoon, around four o'clock, I braved the drizzling rain and drove with Professor Zhuang Zhongwen to the ×× front. He had been there twice before and knew the route well. We detoured to a certain location to have a conversation with the high-ranking commander, General ××. The general was busy with official duties, reviewing documents, reading telegrams, and answering phone calls. In this short one-hour conversation, we talked and paused, stopped and talked again, dividing it into almost seven or eight segments. Some of the things said are not suitable for publication. Here, I will write down what can be made public, and readers can glean the meaning.</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>"If the populace is not well organized in peacetime, we will suffer great losses in wartime. The rear areas should immediately begin training the populace, connecting all units and engaging in more research and discussion under the principle of trusting the government and leaders. Everyone should work hard at their post to save the country, which will indirectly promote the effectiveness of the frontline troops in killing the enemy. Negatively, this includes assisting with frontline supplies, reporting traitorous activities, and maintaining local order. Positively, this includes increasing all production, participating in wartime work, and training the populace in the rear areas, to name a few. It is heartbreaking that on the battlefield today, we only see traitors and not the populace.</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>"Even now, many people still do not clearly understand the meaning of the war of resistance. It must be understood that the enemy's national policy is to destroy our China. We must stand firm, grit our teeth, and take advantage of the current surge of popular sentiment to fight to the death. It is clear that the sacrifices of this war of resistance will be great, but these sacrifices will be worthwhile. Even if we lose a city or a town, these places will certainly be reduced to scorched earth after the artillery fire, and the enemy will have no use for them. The enemy travels across vast oceans, mobilizing troops and causing great disturbances. They face many difficulties and incur great expenses. We, on the other hand, possess the right timing, the favorable terrain, and the support of the people. If we do not fight now, when will we fight?</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>"Our war of resistance policy has long been determined to be a war of attrition, a war of attrition. Even if we fight for three or five years, we will not change our original intention. We must have an indomitable spirit and cannot have a mentality of being concerned about gains and losses. Therefore, I (General ×× speaking of himself) have two slogans that I can offer to my compatriots: ㊀ Compromising halfway is surrender! ㊁ Seeking complete accommodation is suicide!"</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>"Our leader is a renowned military genius. Looking at past wars, what was generally considered risky by people all ended in victory. This time, the leader already has a plan in mind. I remember when he was in Lushan during the summer, he said to us, 'Within three years, I will definitely defeat Japanese imperialism, as long as 400 million people follow me!' Our leader is a revolutionary. He has completed the great mission of unifying China. The second step is how to revitalize China? But Japan is constantly invading, becoming increasingly aggressive. Our only way out is for the whole country to unite, to sacrifice everything, and to resist to the end. Now is the beginning of the war of resistance!"</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>"The enemy's Kurume Division (i.e., the 18th Division) is the most barbaric and ferocious unit in Japan. The Japanese boast that it is the 'guaranteed to conquer China' division. But in the recent fighting in Shanghai, they suffered more than half casualties, losing their elite forces. This shows that although the enemy is stubborn, they are not to be feared. What is most hateful is that the enemy's discipline is corrupt. They rape, pillage, and burn everywhere. The villages they pass through are reduced to ruins. The so-called 'bushido' spirit is nothing more than that of robbers who break into houses and loot!"</p>
<p>㊅</p>
<p>"In the month since the war of resistance began, what we consider most valuable is the high morale. From the officers to the brothers, no matter how tragic the sacrifices, there is absolutely no hesitation. When advancing to the front lines, everyone fights bravely and takes killing the enemy as a joyous occasion. Some continue fighting even when wounded and refuse to retire. Some wounded soldiers signal that they want to be taken back to the front lines. We have such loyal and valiant soldiers who fight for survival and fight for freedom. Ultimately, victory will surely be ours."</p>

<h3>The Issue of Relocating Factories to the Interior</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The relocation of factories to the interior is not only demanded by the current wartime situation, but it is also a necessary arrangement for cultivating national strength and reorganizing national defense in peacetime. Originally, if modern industry is discussed solely from a commercial and economic perspective, the ideal factory site selection only needs to possess four essential elements. First, convenient water and land transportation. Second, convenient access to raw materials. Third, convenient access to power. Fourth, convenient capital flow. However, if one can recognize that industry and agriculture are the lifeblood of a nation's self-sufficiency, safeguarding and preserving them to ensure that they do not stop for even a day, then safety comes first. All the aforementioned conditions of convenience are secondary. If the factory site is suitably safe, even if the natural conditions of convenience cannot be met, they can still be supplemented artificially. For example, transportation can be developed, raw materials can be stored, power can be developed, and capital can follow. Thus, mutually supporting and assisting each other, industry relies on national strength for survival, and national strength relies on industry without weakening.</p>
<p>Our country only has a very shallow industrial foundation, all scattered along the coastal ports. Examining the reasons, in addition to the fact that the locations are somewhat suitable for the so-called conditions of convenience in commercial economics, in the past, the state viewed industry as a source of tax revenue, industry recognized the state as the landowner, the state disregarded the development of industry, and the industrial sector was deeply influenced by the ideology of free trade. Some even had the idea of relying on foreign powers for profit. This was a miscalculation by the state and shortsightedness by the industrial sector. Just look at the destruction of the factory districts in Hongkou and Pudong in Shanghai, which is a lesson before our eyes. Some may say that planning to relocate in the midst of air raids, bombings, and artillery fire is like embracing Buddha's feet only when one is about to die. But the mistakes of the past are not the fault of one party alone. Today, no one should blame anyone. Now that the fire has spread to our doorstep, saving as much as possible is preserving as much as possible. Remaining is better than total destruction. Establishing the country should plan for a hundred years of enjoyment, and establishing a factory should also plan for a permanent foundation. Temporary difficulties should not be feared, and wishful thinking should not be entertained.</p>
<p>Our country is located on the Asian continent and is known for its rivers and waterways. Water transport is the most economical, surpassing both railways and highways. The relocation of factories to the interior will inevitably increase freight transport, which may further promote the repair and dredging of rivers. The rapid currents in the Northwest can gradually be used to generate power. The development of mineral resources may not be successful immediately, but plant-based raw materials can certainly adapt and improve to meet demand. Furthermore, the migration of population and the inflow of capital are inevitable given the circumstances. Europe and America claim that the establishment of factory districts leads to the formation of production groups, with the transfer of the center attracting accompanying industries. With the support of the government, there is no need to worry about being isolated in desolate areas and surviving or perishing on their own.</p>
<p>Now that the decision has been made to relocate to the interior, the selection of suitable regions is the most important issue. Being exposed as a target for air raids and artillery fire makes no difference between the riverside and the sea. Clustering together makes no difference between one location and another. Factories should be dispersed, not clustered. They must be concealed and convenient. There are many benefits to dispersal. For example, during development, it can be done calmly, workers can live scattered, and construction can be expanded horizontally. Defense and economy are combined. Work that can be scattered should also be scattered. For example, handicrafts and light industries can be distributed to workers' homes for production. This is called hiding industry in agriculture. Workers can also engage in cultivation to supplement their income. Although Europe has a limited area, there are still those who practice this. Russia and the United States have many precedents that can be followed. So-called concealment, for example, the Soviet Union built factories in deep mountains and constructed chimneys behind mountains. But the region should still be selected for convenient access to raw materials, water and land transportation, and gradual improvements so as not to fall into the mistake of self-imposed isolation. Here, I am only offering some superficial ideas. As for the factory establishment plan, the factory owners and experts should consider the needs and make a decision. The factory relocation method is handled by the competent authorities and various trade associations and will not be elaborated upon.</p>
<h3>End of Autumn Maneuvers for the Red Army in the Moscow Military District</h3>
<p>Voroshilov's Speech Encourages Officers and Soldiers to Strive for Improvement</p>
<p>[Moscow] The autumn maneuvers for the troops stationed in the Moscow Military District have concluded. A grand parade was held on September 15th, inspected by Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov. Tens of thousands of workers and civilians attended to watch. When Voroshilov appeared, the entire army and people erupted in cheers. After Voroshilov reviewed the troops on horseback, he delivered a speech to the entire army and people, first praising the progress of the Moscow garrison and encouraging all officers and soldiers to continue their efforts to improve, so that knowledge is further enhanced and military and political training is systematically strengthened. Voroshilov then spoke of the people's enthusiasm and love for the Red Army, saying, "Wherever we are, in villages or in collective farmers' homes, we are always and everywhere respected and loved by the people, unparalleled by any army in the world. This is easily explained, because our country's collective farmers all know that the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is their own army, which can protect their happy lives, their families, and all their undertakings. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is the blood and flesh of the farmers themselves, their own children." Finally, Voroshilov said that the 20th anniversary of the Great Proletarian Revolution and the election day of the Soviet Supreme Soviet are approaching. Voroshilov mentioned the enormous tasks facing the country and the Red Army during this period. "The Red Army is the fortress of our country and must participate in this work of paramount political importance together with the entire people in the most active, positive, and conscious manner." After Voroshilov finished his speech, the entire audience applauded and cheered. Subsequently, after Marshal Budyonny delivered a speech of thanks, the entire unit marched past the reviewing stand, concluding the grand ceremony. The next day, Voroshilov returned to Moscow.

<p>[Washington] According to sources from the Treasury Department, the US authorities are currently discussing with British representatives the international actions to be taken after the London Silver Agreement is terminated. According to experts studying the silver issue, after the Silver Agreement is terminated, the US silver purchasing plan will undergo changes. There are conflicting opinions on whether the United States will continue to purchase silver at the current price of 77 cents. The current US silver purchasing plan can be extended to the end of 1937 according to law, so the silver purchasing plan at the current price can be maintained until the end of this year. Furthermore, according to many authoritative scholars, the United States may still raise the price of silver for the benefit of China, as China currently wants to sell a large amount of silver on the world market. When Britain and the US discuss this issue in the future, they may need to pay attention to this issue. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] The British and French governments are currently engaged in negotiations to resolve the following two issues: ㊁ The fluctuating exchange rate of the franc. The exchange rate of the franc has fallen sharply in recent days. At the close of trading today, the exchange rate against the pound was 146 francs and 62 centimes. (A week ago, the exchange rate of the franc against the pound was around 128 francs.) Regarding this matter, British financial circles believe that the French government should allow the franc to float freely so that it can reach an appropriate exchange rate. The British Exchange Equalization Fund should not interfere excessively. In other words, the British Treasury may provide assistance only after the franc has reached an appropriate exchange rate. At this time, it does not intend to take any action to help France stabilize the price of the franc. ㊁ The loan of £40 million that Britain granted to France in March of this year will be due in December of this year. Regarding this matter, the British side believes that it can be extended if necessary. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Nine Nations Sign Supplementary Agreement, Nyon Conference Fully Concluded</h3>
<p>Methods for Safety Underwater, on the Surface, and in the Air Agreed Upon and Implemented. The Original Monitoring Plan in Spanish Waters Has Been Abolished. Germany and Italy Are Both Resentful of This Established Fact.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Nyon Conference has now established complete defense measures against illegal warfare by submarines, warships, and aircraft in the Mediterranean. With the completion of the work of the Nyon Conference, the representatives of various countries have signed a supplementary agreement, expanding the principle of the Nyon Agreement, which was specifically designed to deal with submarines, to warships and aircraft. This new agreement has been under consideration for a long time, and due to Greece's dissent, a sentence has been added to the original text, allowing each government to handle matters itself in its territorial waters as it sees fit. Thereupon, the representatives of all nine countries signed without reservation. The original text will be published on Saturday and Sunday, so that the original text can be sent to Italy first, and Italy will be asked to participate in this new agreement in addition to joining the original Nyon Agreement. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The text of the annex to the Nyon Agreement was released after it was signed here yesterday. It states, "The signatory countries of Great Britain, France, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, having reached an agreement, shall immediately implement the following measures: warships participating in the Mediterranean monitoring system, if they witness warships or merchant ships not belonging to any party in the Spanish Civil War being attacked by aircraft or warships on the high seas, shall immediately open fire in retaliation or interfere by all means to prevent the attack by the aircraft or warships. If the attacker is a warship, other warships participating in the monitoring in the vicinity may be notified to provide assistance. In addition, each signatory country shall, in accordance with the spirit of this agreement, take the measures it deems necessary within its own territorial waters." (Central News Agency, Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The signatory countries of the Mediterranean Agreement signed the annex to the Mediterranean Agreement here at 5:40 pm today. The annex was immediately sent to the Italian government and will be published tomorrow. The contents of the annex stipulate that, except for Spanish merchant ships, if merchant ships of various countries are attacked by aircraft or warships other than submarines, and the aircraft and warships do not comply with the various requirements of internationally recognized international law, especially the 1930 London Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, then the aircraft and warships of the signatory countries shall provide assistance and protection. If the warship attacking the merchant ship is larger in tonnage than the warship performing monitoring duties, other signatory countries' warships may be requested to assist. The above measures apply equally on the high seas and in the territorial waters of the signatory countries. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] Admiral Pound, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and Vice Admiral Esteva, Commander-in-Chief of the French Mediterranean Fleet, are scheduled to meet in Orente today to discuss all the details of joint monitoring of the Mediterranean. (National Maritime Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] After the establishment of the Nyon Agreement, Britain will have 52 destroyers monitoring piracy in the Mediterranean. Twenty-seven of them, namely the first, second, and third divisions, are originally in the central and eastern Mediterranean. Another nine, namely the fourth division, will soon sail from the United Kingdom to the British island of Malta in the Mediterranean. The other sixteen, originally in the Spanish coastal area implementing monitoring measures to prevent interference, will now specialize in monitoring piracy in the Mediterranean in accordance with the provisions of the Nyon Agreement. In addition, the British government has also dispatched two squadrons of seaplanes to assist in the monitoring work. One of them has already flown from the Felixstowe base via the Weymouth Port to the British island of Malta in the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After the signatory countries of the Nyon Agreement signed the annex to the agreement yesterday, Italian officials declared that the Italian government had previously submitted a note explaining Italy's general conditions for participating in the agreement. Since then, although the international situation has fallen into a deadlock, suggestions may be put forward by Britain and France. As for Italy, it has already said everything it could. (Central News Agency, Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] German and Italian newspapers have strongly criticized the Nyon Agreement and the British and French cessation of monitoring in Spanish waters. According to news from Rome, the tone of Italian newspapers criticizing Britain for the Nyon Agreement is more severe than in recent weeks. Rome now feels that the international situation has been aggravated as a result. Many quarters view the agreement as being directed against Italy. According to the Tribune, British-Italian relations have entered a critical period again. Italian newspapers mentioned the British and French fleets jointly defending the Mediterranean, saying that this move is either a formal exercise or an expression of cooperation in possible future wars. The German newspapers' tone is no less severe than that of Italy, saying that the Nyon Agreement and its new annex, as well as the British and French cessation of monitoring in Spanish waters, are developing into a clear demonstration aimed at preserving British and French interests in the Mediterranean while harming Germany and Italy. According to the newspapers, the crisis in the Mediterranean is now becoming increasingly serious. As for the views of German political circles, they can be reflected in the remarks of the newspaper La Toscana, which said that Italy and Germany want the British and French governments to sincerely explain to them their policies in the Mediterranean and towards Spain. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph reported that after Britain and France announced the cessation of monitoring in Spanish waters, the Non-Intervention Committee will continue to exist and handle daily events. Foreign reports that the committee will cease work are unreliable, but the date of the committee's next meeting has not yet been determined. (National Maritime Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Ship Bombed in Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Nationality of Aircraft Unidentified</p>
<p>[London] The Admiralty announced that the British destroyer HMS Fearless was bombed by an aircraft off the port of Gijón in northern Spain. A total of six bombs were dropped. The nationality of the aircraft is still under investigation. British officials said that the nationality of the aircraft could not be determined and that it may even belong to the Spanish Republic. At the time, several warships of the Spanish Nationalist forces were patrolling the coast of Asturias. It is possible that the government aircraft did not recognize the British warship before dropping the bombs. However, this has not yet been proven, so the British government has no basis for lodging a protest at this time. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] It is rumored that the British destroyer HMS Comet and the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious were nearly hit by torpedoes near Malta in the Mediterranean Sea but narrowly escaped. British officials recently stated that this rumor is completely unfounded. According to a report from sailors on the HMS Comet, they saw a streak of foam in the sea, suspected to be caused by a torpedo, but this could not be proven.

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Speech by French Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>The League of Nations is Weak and Needs Immediate Remedy. Spanish Prime Minister Criticizes Germany and Italy</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly convened this morning. After a speech by Spanish Prime Minister Negrín, French Foreign Minister Delbos took the stage at 12:15 PM. He said, "Based on our past experience, if the Covenant of the League of Nations had been accepted and implemented by all countries, the issue of peace would have been resolved long ago. France's belief in the League of Nations has never wavered. France firmly believes that the Covenant of the League of Nations is the best tool for maintaining peace. There is no crisis of the League of Nations at present, but only a crisis of peace. The heads of government of various countries have repeatedly issued declarations of pacifism, which France firmly believes are sincere. However, words alone are not enough; they must be followed by action. Regarding action, Britain and France have advocated a non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War, but everyone knows the outcome. This is truly regrettable. If the countries involved could sincerely withdraw their own people fighting in Spain, the non-intervention policy could be maintained. Otherwise, the crisis ahead is unimaginable, because the balance of power in Europe will be destroyed. In addition, the peace crisis is now seen in the Far East. If countries continue to engage in an arms race, it will not stop until the whole world collapses. However, it is impossible for one country to reduce its military strength while all other countries do not. France will spare no sacrifice to guarantee its own independence. The weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations is a fact. In the past, when incidents occurred, the League could have taken various measures to prevent or stop aggression, but it failed to do so. It is not too late to mend the fold now. France is considering amending the Covenant in this spirit. In short, the most reliable way to guarantee peace is for all countries to jointly respect the obligations they have undertaken. This is the foundation of civilization." Delbos opposed the self-sufficiency policies of various countries, saying that they threatened the peace, freedom, and survival of all nations. Finally, he said that the French government firmly believes that cooperation is possible for all countries, regardless of their political systems. He also said that the joint cooperation of Britain and France can be demonstrated by the Nyon Conference. As a result of this conference, all countries were united and worked hard to guarantee peace, which is by no means impossible. After Delbos finished his speech, the entire audience applauded warmly. Then the assembly was adjourned, and the date of the next meeting will be decided separately by the chairman. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly convened today. Spanish representative Prime Minister Negrín delivered a lengthy speech, stating, "The troops of the aggressor countries are now preparing to give Spain what they believe to be the 'final blow.' I can also responsibly announce to you that Italy is sending troops to the Spanish Nationalist side, in quantities twice as large as the current Italian troops in Spain." Negrín continued, "Fourteen months ago, an armed rebellion broke out in Spain. This was originally a local incident, but soon the situation was ignited by the aid of Italy and Germany. There is ample evidence to support this, because the aid from Italy and Germany to the rebels was the result of negotiations and treaties concluded between the rebels and Italy and Germany before the rebellion occurred. These treaties stipulated that Italy and Germany would aid the rebels, and the rebels would offer Spain to Italy and Germany as a reward. This can be seen even more from the exchange of congratulatory telegrams between Italian leader Mussolini and Spanish Nationalist General Franco after the fall of the port of Santander, and from the recent speech by German leader Hitler at the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg." Negrín then opposed the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War, saying that this agreement not only harmed the sovereignty of Spain, but also absolutely contradicted international law, and could not prevent the alliance of the rebels from continuing to send munitions and troops to supply the rebels. Negrín finally requested the implementation of the Covenant of the League of Nations and asked the League of Nations to recognize the following principles: ① Spain is now a victim of aggression by Italy and Germany; ② If this aggression is to be stopped, the League of Nations must hold an urgent discussion; ③ Spain should be allowed to purchase the military supplies it needs; ④ Foreign volunteers in Spain must be withdrawn; ⑤ Spain should enjoy the benefits of the Nyon Mediterranean Agreement, and the Mediterranean protection and surveillance system should treat Spanish ships equally.

<h3>Roosevelt's Speech Commemorating the American Constitution</h3>
<p>Vehemently Criticizes Dictatorial Politics, Says America Seeks to Protect Its Territory and People</p>
<p>[Washington] Today marks the 150th anniversary of the American Constitution. President Roosevelt recently gave an important speech via radio broadcast, stating that 150 years ago, European countries were not interested in the American political system, and America was also indifferent to Europe. Today, the situation has changed. "Our actions have a significant impact not only in the Americas, but also in Europe and the Far East. Conversely, the actions of all countries in the world are also closely related to us. In terms of political systems, monarchies, because they have neglected the welfare of the people, have been replaced by democracies. The operation of democracies may not be entirely satisfactory, and they have been replaced by dictatorships. In general, dictatorial countries openly provoke democratic countries, saying that they are incapable. These provocative actions, whether from communism or dictatorship, can enable the people of those countries to obtain certain material benefits that democracy cannot provide. In short, it is to maintain order by destroying freedom and rights and using terror. Dictatorial countries believe that democracy has reached its end and should be learned from, but the believers of democracy still account for the vast majority in the world and are not moved by it. It can be seen that dictatorship only threatens world culture." The President also said that all countries in the world are worried about foreign aggression and revolution. "The American people will be able to protect themselves within their own territory." He then addressed the situation of American workers, saying, "The working class demands to improve their material lives, and the government must be able to satisfy them. Once this goal is achieved, the value of democracy and the uselessness of dictatorship will be proven." Finally, the President addressed the Supreme Court reform bill, saying that this bill does not contradict the current Constitution. Although many of the Supreme Court's recent rulings have been untimely, the people should still believe in the current Constitution to solve various new problems.

Yesterday, the committee convened more than 20 women's organizations and 1,000 Boy Scouts to set off separately to solicit donations vigorously. According to the number of members of women's organizations, there are more than 5,000 people in total. At the meeting, the attending representatives enthusiastically donated on the spot and informed all their members to solicit donations from their relatives and friends. If each person donates ten items, 50,000 items should be obtained. If 1,000 Boy Scouts ask for one item to be made from each household, and each person gets five donations per day, then 50,000 items can also be obtained within ten days. It is not difficult to collect the total number of 200,000 on schedule. It is also reported that if the donation booklets received by women's organizations are insufficient, they can go to the Shanghai Branch of the China Women's Comfort and Self-Defense Association to collect them.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Songhu War, the front line has needed a large amount of supplies.

<p>Patriotism of Children is Commendable</p>
<p>Yesterday, a child, Hou Zhiqiang, only ten years old, because of his eagerness to serve the country, heard that the China Women's Movement League had a donation, and immediately took off his necklace, broke it, and asked the member of the League, Pan Qiying, to donate it to the country's war of resistance. Another eleven-year-old child, Guan Cunde, yesterday sent a telescope worth 300 yuan in national currency to the Shanghai Comfort Committee in the Ningbo Fellow Association, asking it to be forwarded to Commander-in-Chief Zhang for use, and hoping that all children in the city would save money on sweets and cakes and give it to the banks designated by the Comfort Committee, so that the necessary supplies for the front line could be purchased and transported at any time. It is also reported that Jiang Fu, Fei Sen, Zou Leng, He Yi, and others have collected a total of 40 yuan and asked our newspaper to purchase food needed by the officers and soldiers on the front line. Our newspaper has already collected and handled it and brought it to the front line. (Omitted donation list)</p>
<h3>Unofficial Representative of Spanish Rebels Expelled by Swiss Police</h3>
<p>[Geneva] Four unofficial representatives sent by General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, were compiling propaganda materials here, attacking the Prime Minister of the Republican government of that country, Negrín, and distributing these propaganda materials to the delegations of various countries to the League of Nations General Assembly. The Swiss Department of Justice and the Police Department have recently received an order from the Federal Government to expel the representatives and order them to leave Switzerland before the 20th of this month.

<h3>Telegrams to Changshu County to Release Rice</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Others Send Telegrams Separately. Provincial Government Certificate Regarding People's Food</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all sectors of society in this city have encouraged inland rice merchants to provide assistance in order to regulate the people's food and prepare for a long-term war of resistance, and have issued certificates and grain transportation permits from the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Command to protect them. Recently, a rice merchant, Bei Jindai, and others loaded 12 ships of rice in Changshu to Shanghai, but they were detained by the county government and have not been released. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others, believing that this matter affects the regulation of food for the citizens of Shanghai, have separately telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order its subordinates to release them immediately. The original text reads: ① To the Jiangsu Provincial Government, according to the Changshu Office, rice merchants Shi Zufou and others, under the order of the Municipal Food Regulation Committee, hired 12 ships from Changshu in winter and loaded more than 2,490 piculs of rice to Shanghai. They were detained after passing Mochen. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau had consulted with the Department of Civil Affairs and transferred an order for release, but it has not been released. The merchants are exhausted. Please order the Changshu County Government to release them on a specific date. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. ② To Chen County Chief of Changshu County Government, recently, according to a letter from the Changshu Rice Industry Association, members of our association, Shi Zufou and others, hired boatmen such as Bei Jindai to transport 12 ships of rice from Changshu. They were detained by your government. The sale of this food was originally to regulate the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai. The Social Affairs Bureau had already obtained approval and telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to certify it. I hope that the ships, cargo, and boatmen will be released together. I am deeply grateful to the public. Shanghai Municipal Local Association. In addition, the Municipal Food Regulation Committee also feels that the Changshu County Government's detention of rice ships from members of the Shanghai Changshu Public Office, such as Shi Zufou, has a great impact on the city's food supply. Therefore, it has specially dispatched Lu Muqin as a representative to go to Changshu tonight to negotiate with the county government to release all 12 rice ships and the boatmen on each ship in order to maintain the city's food supply.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>New Beijing Plans to Open Another Shift. Other Ships Change Routes</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai sent four British and Italian ships to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo to transport refugees back to their hometown.

<h3>Dr. Gonner's Sincere Advice to the Japanese People</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, I am writing this letter to sincerely advise the people of your country, which is presumptuous. However, the situation is such that my heart is truly alarmed, so I dare not remain silent. I sincerely offer my advice, and whether or not it is appreciated is of no concern to me. The reason for my writing this letter stems from three points: First, I dare to call myself a good friend of your country, and I have always admired the people of your country. Second, I am deeply afraid that the Japanese people will be deceived by the mistaken ideas of their national leaders, especially the delusions of the military authorities, and led astray. Third, this view is not unique to me, but is shared by people all over the world. Therefore, I want to sincerely offer it to you, and I hope that you can understand my humble intention.</p>
<p>My friendship with your country can be demonstrated by one thing. There have been misunderstandings between Japan and the United States due to the immigration issue. I have met with President Roosevelt twice recently and repeatedly asked him to find a way to ease the tense relationship between the two countries, hoping that Japanese immigrants to the United States can be allocated according to the proportion of the population, or according to the principle of 2% of the total immigration from other countries in the world, then only 250 people from all of Asia can immigrate to the United States each year, let alone Japan. If this can be done, then the unfair distribution and restrictions on Japanese immigrants can be corrected and relaxed. I firmly believe that President Roosevelt and other authorities have the intention of adopting this proposal. I have lived in Asia for 30 years, mostly in India. During these 30 years, I have personally witnessed the progress of the Japanese people, which is truly admirable. At that time, I deeply hoped that Japan would come forward to lead Asia, to engage in positive construction, and to maintain peace, so that Asia could change its situation and not resemble the conflicts in Europe today. Who would have known that our wishes would be shattered, and Japan would stage a fierce war in Asia, forming irreconcilable hatred. Instead of taking the right path, with an attitude of friendship and a spirit of cooperation, to gain the trust of China, and then advance to become the leader of Asia, now Japan has abandoned the right path and gone astray, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The attitude taken by the Japanese people can be divided into three types: First, maintaining isolation; second, cooperating sincerely with China, which can promote the development of both China and Japan; and third, becoming enemies with China, thereby becoming enemies with Asia, and ultimately, the general trend may be to become enemies with the world. In summary, the first type is an impossible fact, the second type has been clearly rejected by Japan, and the third type is being adopted. This is a great mistake. Most Japanese politicians with a long-term vision strongly advocated the second type of strategy. If Japan had listened to this suggestion, it would have been of great benefit to China and Asia. Moreover, Japan has many things to offer to the world, but Japan has erected military barriers, causing it to become isolated from the world and unable to contribute.</p>
<p>Japanese people reply that the reason why China and Japan cannot cooperate is due to China's opposition and refusal to cooperate. May I ask if China has refused to cooperate? China certainly cannot allow Japan to annex its territory and infringe upon its sovereignty. This kind of false cooperation is naturally rejected by China, and world opinion praises its effective rejection. This is not cooperation, but hegemony, the behavior of a master towards a slave. If China blindly accepts this kind of cooperation, it will lose its national spirit and cease to be a country. May I ask the people of your country, with a calm mind, can you respect a submissive China as a country? I firmly believe that any Japanese person with a bit of spirit will say no.</p>
<p>As for the problem of Japan's overpopulation, what is Japan's way out? Overpopulation is indeed a crucial issue for your country, and I also firmly believe that I should urge the world to pay attention to it and find a proper solution. However, as for whether mainland China can accommodate Japan's surplus population, please examine it in good conscience. Can this be used as a pretext for the current aggression? Leaving aside mainland China for now, even the occupation of the three northeastern provinces of Manchuria cannot be justified by this reason. When Manchuria was opened up 30 years ago, 30 million Chinese people, not Japanese people, immigrated there to engage in cultivation. Is this not enough to show where the population pressure lies? The population density is in China, not in Japan. If Japan cannot move its people to the relatively sparsely populated Manchuria, how can its farmers compete with the densely populated farmers of mainland China? I am afraid that Japan's current invasion of China cannot be justified by overpopulation. The real reason lies elsewhere. If you say that "China is chaotic, officials are corrupt, and stabilizing China is the mission of the Japanese nation," then China was indeed chaotic for a time, but there have been five revolutions in one generation. As for the corruption of officials, I have also expressed my opinions in front of Chinese officials, advocating reform. In fact, the Chinese people themselves have worked hard to reform, and many aspects have been improved. At the beginning of the war, the Chinese people were rectifying official conduct, achieving great results. Domestic chaos has been less common in the past two years than at any time in the past 25 years. The country is developing rapidly, united, and various improvements are rare in the world. Therefore, your country's so-called "mission" to China is no longer timely. In fact, Japan's obstruction of China this time will only lead to chaos, fragmentation, and resentment, and the disaster is just beginning. Your country is now doing its best to hinder China's progress. If Japan really wants China to develop, why not let it be free and insist on hindering it at the time of its greatest construction? If you say that Japan's obstruction of China will only cause temporary chaos, but will be able to stabilize it in the future, citing the examples of Goryeo (Korea) and Manchuria, it seems very reasonable. However, I dare not believe it. This incident is different from before. Japan is now using force to take the life of a large country. China may be able to painfully submit to Japan's control of border areas such as Goryeo and Manchuria, but the central part will never allow anyone to invade it and will fight hard to maintain its territorial integrity, even if it means a long-term war. However, this is enough to deplete Japan's energy. Today, the world situation is changing rapidly. Once Japan has a conflict with Russia, will this strong enemy of 400 million people, a nation full of strength, not become a major threat? Japan will be in a difficult situation for many years to come. Can it really be unafraid? Moreover, even if Japan wins this war, it will not be enough to solve everything, and the resentment it sows may be abandoned by the world. In addition, China is determined to fight a long-term war, and Japan's military operations will be ineffective. Victory in the future may not be guaranteed. Currently, Japan's economic crisis, coupled with the fact that some countries sympathetic to China may break off economic relations with Japan, Japan's war in China may be difficult to maintain without defeat. As for the killing of Japanese people in North China and the incident at the Shanghai airfield, this is indeed regrettable, but tracing back to the root cause, all of these facts stem from the same cause: Japan's invasion of Chinese territory. Japan's infringement on China has led to incidents. Therefore, these incidents cannot be said to be the cause of this war. This should be understood by the people of your country. According to my observation, Japan's attitude towards China is between contempt and fear. It despises its government and people, and fears its current astonishing progress. Today, China is progressing rapidly, and the so-called contempt is no longer justified. The main reason for Japan's invasion of China stems from a psychological fear, believing that this is the time for Japan to rule China. Once China becomes strong, this is the real reason for Japan's invasion of China. The other reasons are only similar. However, Japan's desire to rule China is clear.</p>
<p>However, there are two ways for Japan to establish its power in China: one is by force, and the other is by friendship. Japan has now taken the path of force, which is self-defeating and creates a deep hatred that will not be resolved for generations. Japan claims that if Japan succeeds in China, China will be powerless, and its weak anger will not last long. I dare not believe this.</p>
<p>The Chinese people number 400 million. Can Japan suppress this great nation for a long time? It should be known that China is not comparable to India and should not be compared with it. Even if Britain loses India, it will not be affected, because they are far apart. Japan's relationship with China is different. Even if it can be subdued for a time, if there is a loss in the future, the country may perish with it. If China cannot be independent, then so be it. Once it can be independent, it will annex Japan, because the land of China and Japan is contiguous, and the Japanese nation is also smaller.</p>
<p>I am afraid that your country's authorities will indulge in extravagance at the expense of the people and make a desperate gamble. Even if you can win now, the future is worrying, and who will win is not yet certain. China is determined to fight a long-term war to deplete Japan's energy. As time goes by, the hardships will deepen, not only causing trouble for yourself, but also harming your neighbors. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Enemy Army Suffers a Third Major Defeat, Launches Repeated Attacks, Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Near Luodian, Over 10,000 Enemy Soldiers Killed; Our Army Kills an Enemy Lieutenant Colonel in the Battle of Yangmuqiao; Over 30 Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Pudong This Morning</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy initially suffered setbacks in Shanghai, and then repeated the old trick of January 28th, deploying its main force to land in Liuhe, hoping to threaten our flanks. Unexpectedly, in the Battle of Luodian, it was almost completely annihilated by our army, and it had to ask for help from the country. Since the first of this month, it has once again brought its elite naval, land, and air forces, as well as mechanized units, and forcibly landed in Wusong, attacking our positions near Beisitang and Yanghang. After our army's heroic resistance, many enemies were killed. Our army, in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop, gradually led the enemy deeper. The enemy thought it had won and advanced rashly. In recent days, fierce fighting has taken place near Yong'an Bridge and Yangmu Bridge. On the 17th, the enemy spared no effort to use all its elites, making a desperate gamble, attempting to fight a decisive battle with us on the eve of September 18th. Who knew that our army had already seen through its conspiracy. The loyal and brave soldiers of our front line sacrificed themselves for the country, one against a hundred, and gave the enemy a head-on blow. After several charges, they completely annihilated the enemy in front of our position. This was the third major defeat since the outbreak of the war.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army's Three General Offensives Result in Over 10,000 Deaths, Morale is Low</h3>
<p>The Entire Town of Luodian is Reduced to Ashes; The Water of the Jiejing River Turns Red</p>
<p>This morning, a reporter visited the Shanghai-Wusong front line and met with a senior officer. According to him, the details of the recent battles in Yanghang, Yuepu, and Luodian are as follows:</p>
<p>The Plan for a Swift Victory Fails</p>
<p>On the 12th of this month, the enemy's 3rd, 6th, 11th, 12th, 16th, and newly added 9th Divisions of the Army, and utilizing the superior naval and air forces, began the third phase of the general offensive against us. Its main force attacked the center of our position from Yanghang, Yuepu, along both sides of the Baoliu and Baoluo highways, attempting to cut off the Shanghai-Taicang highway before September 18th, occupy Shanghai-Wusong, and use a part of its force to attack us from Luodian and Chuansha to relieve the besieged troops.</p>
<p>Two Miserable Defeats, the Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>On the 13th and 14th, there were fierce battles with our army in places such as Dieyujiaojiao, Xujiaojiao, and Yong'an Bridge. The soldiers of our army were determined to live and die with the position. When the enemy's infantry approached, they immediately counterattacked, killing many enemies, whose corpses were scattered everywhere. Their attack made no progress. This was the enemy's first setback. After dusk on the 14th, taking advantage of the enemy's fatigue, we launched a full-line counterattack. The fighting was particularly fierce in the northern Luodian area. The enemy troops at Shengqiao, Liuweiqiao, and Panjiaqiao stations were all broken through by our army at that time. The water of the Jiejing River turned red, and Luodian was completely burned down. We captured a military flag of the enemy's 22nd Regiment and seized many important military orders and documents of the enemy army. According to the war records in a certain officer's diary, every company suffered more than half of its casualties in the fierce fighting that lasted for ten days.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain, Our Army Displays its Power</p>
<p>On the 16th, the enemy reorganized its remnants and reinforced Luodian with the Taiwan Guard Force and attacked again. Because the weather was gloomy and rainy, the enemy's air force could not operate. Our army's morale was high, and it often launched counterattacks from the front with its main force, fighting fiercely with the enemy in the areas of Nanbeitangkou, Dongjiangzhai, and Luodian. Because our infantry and artillery cooperated well, the mortar team exerted great power and attacked a regiment of the enemy at Zhangjiayan, which immediately collapsed. At the same time, our Jiading anti-aircraft artillery and the front of our position at Jinjiawan shot down an enemy bomber each. The enemy suffered heavy casualties on this day. This was the enemy's second setback in the attack.</p>
<p>Six Days of Fierce Fighting, Over 10,000 Enemies Killed</p>
<p>On the 17th, the enemy added one of its divisions to the Yanghang front and launched the final general offensive again, sparing no effort to launch repeated attacks on our heavy defenses with dense troops. We used machine guns to sweep, killing countless enemies. Our position remained unmoved. Just as our fresh troops arrived, they joined the counterattack from the areas of Yangmuqiao, Jinzhai, and Beizhudian and swept the enemy fiercely. By 12:00, the enemy had been completely defeated. Since the morning of the 18th, the enemy has completely retreated. In the areas of Yanghang, Yong'an Bridge, Jinjiawan, and the surrounding ten miles, enemy corpses were everywhere, and many military supplies were abandoned. The state of their embarrassment can be imagined. After six days of fierce fighting with the enemy, over 10,000 enemies were killed, which was the tragic defeat of the enemy army's third phase of the general offensive. The arrogant enemy army's morale was greatly挫.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Suffers a Miserable Defeat in the Attack on Yangmu Bridge</h3>
<p>Enemy Corpses Pile Up Like Mountains on Both Sides of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway; Enemy Lieutenant Colonel Killed Identified as from the Hiroshima Division</p>
<p>The war report from Liuhang received this morning is as follows: (1) On the 17th, three regiments of enemy troops launched a fierce bombardment on the line from Yangmuqiao to Chaowang Temple in the east of Liujiahang. From afternoon to dusk, part of the infantry attacked our position. Our army immediately rose up, launched a counterattack, charged, and fought several times in close combat. The enemy army was completely defeated at about 10 pm that night. Enemy corpses piled up like mountains along the Shanghai-Taicang highway. The enemy in the Xiaozhuzhai area was heavily bombarded by our concentrated artillery fire, suffering heavy losses. From the evening of the 17th to the morning of the 18th, the front line returned to silence, which shows that the enemy's offensive action has completely failed. (2) An enemy lieutenant colonel was killed by our army at Liujiahang on the evening of the 17th. After searching the symbols hidden on his body, he was identified as belonging to the 34th Regiment of the 5th Division of Hiroshima. After reading his diary, it was learned that the unit arrived at the Yangtze River Estuary on the 1st of this month, landed on the 5th, rested in Wusong on the 6th, and only moved forward to Yanghang and Liuhang on the 9th. (3) The enemy suffered the most casualties along the highway in Yangmuqiao and near Jinjiawan, about more than 1,000 people, and abandoned many weapons and materials.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Opens Fire on the North Station and Other Places</h3>
<p>Over 300 Enemies at Sijing Ball Field Invade Jiangwan, Repelled by Our Army</p>
<p>The enemy in the Jiangwan area, with the arrival of reinforcements to replenish equipment, has been lying dormant in trenches since the 17th and dared not sneak out. Therefore, the entire line was silent. At 5:00 am yesterday, the enemy suddenly launched fierce artillery fire on our North Station, May 30th Cemetery, and Chi Zhi University, which lasted until 6:30 am. Our fortifications are strong and there were no losses. In the area of Lijiaqiao Sijing Ball Field north of Sanmin Road, more than 300 enemies invaded our Jiangwan area position and were repelled by our head-on interception.</p>
<h3>Over 30 Enemy Planes Reconnoiter Pudong</h3>
<p>Making Aimless Bombings, Causing No Damage to Us</p>
<p>The situation in Pudong has not yet reached a serious stage. Last night, the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River, fearing bombing by our air force, were in a state of chaos and panic all night long. Therefore, only a few armed speedboats were sent to patrol back and forth to prevent our army from taking the opportunity to attack. They never dared to approach the Pudong front line. At 7:00 am this morning, more than 30 enemy planes suddenly hovered over the area of Qichangzhan and Yangjing, dropping bombs. Our army immediately entered a state of strict alert. However, the Japanese planes carried out aimless bombing and flew away in all directions after 30 minutes. At 9:00 am, one or two enemy warships in Hongkou fired more than ten shells at various places in Pudong. Our army also retaliated, threatening the enemy warships, forcing them to stop. Therefore, at 10:00 am, calm was restored.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Escape Downstream in Pudong</h3>
<p>Fearing Our Air Force Attack</p>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy warships docked in Pudong suddenly increased, totaling 24 ships. From the No. 1 buoy to the No. 20 buoy, there was almost one enemy warship docked at each buoy. However, after our air force launched several night raids last night, the enemy warships docked in Pudong were terrified and fled to the Huangpu River area below Yangshupu. Especially the enemy warships from the No. 4 buoy to the No. 10 buoy have all escaped this morning. It is said that two of them were damaged by our aircraft bombing and have escaped to the Wusong Estuary for repairs.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Yongqing and Gu'an, Our Army Bravely Repels the Enemy</h3>
<p>Zhuozhou City is Still Firmly Defended by Our Army; Fierce Fighting on the Jinpu Line, Yao Guantun Area</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Military News, the armies of our army on the Pinghan Road front have been fighting fiercely with the enemy in the mountainous area northwest of Fangshan for days. The situation along the Liulihe and Yongding River lines is extremely tragic. The enemies who have crossed the river several times in Yongqing and Gu'an have been bravely repelled by our army. The enemy has suffered heavy casualties. Now that the initial goal of our war of attrition has been achieved, on the evening of the 17th, according to the predetermined plan, we withdrew from the guard position to the established position south of Zhuoxian, preparing for a decisive battle with the enemy. At present, all our frontline troops have reached the predetermined position. The enemy's plan to outflank Zhuoxian, cut off Pinghan transportation, and surround our combat troops north of Zhuoxian has completely failed. (Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The war on the Pinghan Line has progressed to the area near Gaobeidian, south of Zhuozhou, on the 18th. However, Zhuozhou City is still firmly defended by the Chinese army. A large team of Chinese troops between Changxiang and Zhuozhou is still resisting the Japanese army. (Express News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Last night, taking advantage of our change of guard, the enemy occupied Yao Guantun, Northwest Gao Guantun, and Northeast Mei Guantun. Since 10:00 am this morning, artillery battles have been fierce and have not stopped all day. The enemy fired eight or nine hundred shells to the north, but they all fell on the empty ground around the station, injuring only a few old people. Six enemy tanks were active in Renhe Village northwest of the station and were repelled by our armored vehicles. The enemy is very afraid of our accurate artillery fire. Over eighty enemies at Lilou, four or five miles northwest of the station, have been surrounded by our army. The enemies have entered civilian houses and are conducting a thorough search. The battle stopped at 9:00 pm. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Guerrillas Active in the Northeast, Tensions in the Region</h3>
<p>Hailong Railway Bridge is Destroyed, Japanese and Puppet Troops Exhausted</p>
<p>[Shenyang] Recently, the Shenji Line has been attacked by guerrillas from time to time. The railway bridge near Hailong Station was destroyed by guerrillas on the evening of the 17th, causing a great impact on transportation. The Japanese army has posted notices in various villages near the area, warning the villagers not to be used by the guerrillas, otherwise, once discovered, the entire village will be bombed. However, the guerrillas are still active as usual. According to general estimates, there are about 400,000 Japanese troops currently in "Manchukuo," but they are not as good as the guerrillas in guerrilla warfare and are exhausted. (Express News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>[Shenyang] Recently, the number of Japanese reinforcements coming to "Manchukuo" from Japan and Korea has been like a tide, which shows the tension in the situation in Manchuria. The Japanese army often moves at night and keeps it strictly secret. However, according to reliable sources, the Japanese troops who recently arrived in Manchuria from Japan have been divided and sent to Dao'an (translation) in the northwest and Ningta and other places in the east. (Express News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Taiyuan, Three Shot Down</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] At 11:00 AM on the 18th, one enemy plane flew over this city for reconnaissance. It was intercepted by several of our planes and fled. At 3:00 PM, two more enemy planes came, attempting to bomb. Five of our planes intercepted them, and the enemy planes dared not enter the city, immediately fleeing northeast. Our planes pursued and shot one down at Mumao River in Xinxian County and another in Guoxian County. All four pilots were killed, and one was captured by us. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Bombs Datong and Other Places</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] Our air force repeatedly flew to the Datong area to bomb enemy key installations, many of which were destroyed. The enemy's morale is extremely low. Seven of our planes flew to the Guangling and Lingqiu areas on the 18th to assist our army in combat. It is expected that our army will make significant progress within days. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Reconnoiter Outside Lianyungang</h3>
<p>[Xuzhou] Lianyungang telephone: Five or six enemy warships come and go不定综, escorting their aircraft carrier, entrenched in the Dongliandao and Che'niushan and Pingshan areas, and also frequently send small boats to and fro outside the port for reconnaissance. On the 17th, they captured more than a dozen of our fishermen from Dongliandao, forcing them to reveal military information, and after interrogation, drowned them in the sea. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Transport Ships Continue to Arrive at Dagu</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Transportation circles report that several more enemy transport ships arrived at Dagu on the 18th, with a total of three to four thousand people. After landing, they immediately went to the Jinpu Line for troop rotation. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee to Convene on Tuesday</h3>
<p>US Unlikely to Refuse Participation</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the League of Nations Council decided to refer the Sino-Japanese dispute to the 23-nation Advisory Committee, the committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 21st of this month to discuss two matters: ❶ Inviting representatives from both parties, namely China and Japan, to attend and express their opinions; ❷ Whether Germany should be invited to attend, given that Germany declared its withdrawal from the League in October of that year after the committee was established in February 1933. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that the United States previously participated in the committee, setting a precedent for non-member states of the League of Nations to participate in the committee. As for whether the US government will continue to participate, the League of Nations and the Washington government are still in continued negotiations. The US has not yet made a decision. The Chinese delegation is confident that the United States will at least send observers to attend. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Europeans Should Support China's Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>Praise for the "Deutscher Tageszeitung's" Correct Argument</p>
<p>[Berlin] The "Deutscher Tageszeitung" commented on the Far East situation today, stating that regarding China and Japan, we should decide whether to support China or Japan. This is a matter of conscience, especially in Europe and Germany. As far as Germany is concerned, our emotions are evenly balanced. If we allow China to be swallowed by Japan today, the blame borne by the white powers will be evident. For Japan's sake, having obtained the entire northern coast of China, it should stop advancing, otherwise, one day, it will not only encounter resistance from China but also resistance from international forces. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Batavia Donate 200,000</h3>
<p>500 Pounds of Quinine</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Overseas Chinese in Batavia have recently donated three batches of funds for charitable causes in the motherland, totaling 200,000 yuan. The Jinji Fujian Association and other groups have also made donations. The details are as follows: ❶ The Jinji Fujian Association remitted 10,000 yuan through HSBC Bank in Ipoh on August 21st and another 10,000 yuan through Overseas Chinese Bank in Ipoh on September 3rd. ❷ The Overseas Chinese in Batavia Donating to Charitable Causes Committee remitted 100,000 yuan to the Chinese Red Cross Society on August 23rd and another 100,000 yuan to the same society on September 2nd, totaling 200,000 yuan. Furthermore, as the city is a quinine-producing area, the committee has sent personnel to the quinine factory to negotiate the purchase of 500 kilograms, which will save approximately 6,000 yuan compared to the Shanghai market price. The shipment will be sent back as soon as a suitable vessel is available for use by the Public Health Bureau. (China News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Returned Overseas Chinese from Japan Arrive Safely in Changsha</h3>
<p>[Changsha] More than 300 returned overseas Chinese from Japan, after departing from Guangdong by train, were sent back to their hometowns on the 17th. They arrived in Changsha on the 18th. He Jian ordered the military and police to make proper arrangements for them. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Tzu Lien Hui Appeals for the Refugees</h3>
<p>Inviting Mei Lanfang to Broadcast, Famous Amateurs and Movie Stars All Invited to Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity National Fitness Joint Disaster Relief Association's Refugee Relief Committee has established 50 shelters to accommodate refugees who have gathered in the city since the start of the Songhu Battle. In addition to finding ways to send them away daily, the number of residents often exceeds 30,000, requiring daily supplies, medical care, etc., which require funds. Moreover, as the cool autumn approaches, it is even more necessary to prepare clothing and bedding for the refugees to keep warm. The association's source of funding relies entirely on donations from all sectors. At a time when the war is raging and all industries are stagnant, fundraising is already difficult, and it is unbearable to allow the refugees to starve to death. Therefore, in order to implement refugee relief, the association will specially invite Dr. Mei Lanfang, as well as amateur performers from the Zhengyi Society, Fanhuan Ferry Club, Letian Ji, and the General Affairs Section of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, and movie stars from Xinhua and Mingxing Yihua companies, the Shanghai Drama Circle Salvation Association, musicians, and famous performers to participate in broadcasting on the Foyin Radio Station (frequency 980, call sign XMHB) from 1:00 PM to 4:25 PM and from 4:30 PM to 8:00 PM daily on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month to raise funds for the relief of refugees.</p>
<h3>Situation of Reduced Administration in the Local Court</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, part of the office of the Shanghai Local Court's judges and other personnel is now located in the Zhonghui Building. Due to financial difficulties, most of the judges and clerks are temporarily given a living allowance of 50 yuan per month, while a few responsible personnel are paid as usual. As for the bailiffs, only four are retained, and the remaining fifteen are dismissed, to be notified again when the situation is calm. However, these fifteen dismissed bailiffs were dispatched to Shanghai by the High Court on July 18th of this year to replace a batch of old bailiffs who were dismissed. Unexpectedly, it has only been 25 days. The travel expenses are not covered, and even the 100 yuan deposit paid has not been received temporarily. On the day the bailiffs returned to their hometowns, the Songjiang Railway Station was bombed. At that time, many court badges were found at the station. If they were killed, it would be truly pitiful. As for the Procuratorate, because it is responsible for prosecution and cannot be suspended, everything remains as before. However, three prosecutors are assigned to take special responsibility. In the Han police section, Deputy Police Chief Chen Xihui has resigned and has been approved to return to his hometown. The court's work is currently overseen by Chief Police Zhang Shuping, who leads the bailiffs to guard the court, so the court's dignity is still maintained.</p>

<h3>More Than 1,400 US Troops Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The US transport ship Chaumont, accompanied by the cruiser Marblehead, carrying 1,435 US troops from San Diego, sailed through the Pacific to Shanghai. It entered Wusongkou at 9:00 AM this morning (the 19th) and arrived in Shanghai at noon.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Enemy Aircraft Raid the Capital This Morning</h3>
<p>Several Bombs Dropped, No Major Losses, Four Enemy Aircraft Shot Down by Our Air Force</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 8:45 AM this morning, 46 enemy aircraft attempted to raid the capital. However, after receiving the warning, we immediately dispatched a large number of air force planes to intercept them in the suburbs. When the enemy planes flew over Zhenjiang, our planes had already arrived, and a fierce encounter ensued. However, several enemy planes still managed to reach the airspace over the capital and dropped several bombs, causing no major losses. In this battle, four enemy planes were destroyed by our air force and anti-aircraft guns and fell in the nearby suburbs. An hour later, the remaining planes escaped. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Japan has invaded our North China and attacked our Shanghai. The greedy ambition is outrageous and infuriates both gods and men. Now, putting aside North China, let's talk about Shanghai. This time, the Japanese are fighting in Shanghai not only against our country but also against the UK, France, and the US. Not only are they fighting against the UK, France, and the US, but they are also fighting against themselves. Why is this? Since the start of the war, the sacrifice of life and property in our country in the war has been countless. The tangible and intangible direct and indirect losses of the UK, France, and the US are also immeasurable. Especially the losses of Japan, the destruction of factories, the stagnation of commerce, the waste of war expenses and machinery, and the sacrifice of generals and soldiers, how can they be measured? This is only the current sacrifice. The permanent sacrifice is even more difficult to count. Therefore, our resistance and war against Japan this time is not only for our country but also for the UK, France, and the US. Not only is it for the UK, France, and the US, but it is also for Japan. Only war can frustrate its ambitions. Only war can make it realize. Only war can prompt it to reflect. I ask the Japanese, what are they here for?</p>

<h3>Painful Memories (7)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>❻ Beiping Under the Iron Heel of the Enemy</p>
<p>Within ten days after the fall of Beiping, the Japanese army did not enter the city of Beiping, but were stationed in the suburbs. There were three reasons: First, the battles on the Jinpu, Pinghan, and Pingsui lines were still developing forward and had not yet occupied a solid base. Second, there were many Hebei security teams lurking in the suburbs. Third, they were waiting to see the attitude of the great powers. In addition, the members of the ‘Local Maintenance Association’ also thought at the time that their request to the Japanese army not to enter the city was one of the reasons, but it was later proved that it was completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>After the fall of Beiping, the general people of Beiping can be roughly divided into two categories: one category is those who plan to leave as soon as transportation is available; the other category is those who cannot leave or have no way to make a living after leaving, and have to listen to their fate. As for the various "associations" and "offices" in politics, they are all the doings of traitors and quasi-traitors, and everyone does not pay attention. Moreover, it was a period of chaos, a Japanese ronin could buy a group of Chinese traitors and start some "office" and issue declarations, and a few Chinese who aspired to be traitors could start some "association" and make petitions. In fact, all of this was uncertain. When the Japanese army officially started the puppet organization, it was not known how it would be done. Therefore, the situation in Beiping at that time could only be regarded as a period of competition among various traitors, and there was no need to pay attention. As for their ugliness, the reporter has already roughly described it above.</p>
<p>Beiping has a population of 1.53 million. If all of these people could move and had a way to move, and had a way to make a living after leaving, I think, except for a very small number of traitors, no one would not leave. In fact, for the average person, there is no great danger in staying in Beiping; however, no one does not want to leave immediately; no one can stand that depressed feeling! This proves that the Chinese nation has indeed awakened. The test train was on August 5th, and the official traffic was on the 6th. The crowding of passengers at the East Station was unprecedented. Every day, more than two or three thousand people went to Tianjin. In the first few days, the Japanese said: these people who are leaving are either members of the Blue Shirts Society or communists, because they are afraid of the ‘Imperial Army’, so they fled. The tone seemed very happy. Later, more and more people left, and Beiping had a tendency to become an empty city, so even the Japanese became alarmed; so at the station, they often asked passengers the question of ‘why do you want to leave’? Some were escorted back to Ping and forced to stay because their answers were inappropriate, even after arriving in Tianjin.</p>
<p>As for the market, all the shops were forced to open by the police bureau's order, and even closing down was not allowed, so they had to open their doors reluctantly every day; however, most of them were desolate. In order to ‘prosper the market’, the puppet municipal government completely exempted entertainment donations for one month and forced all entertainment venues to operate as usual; but on the one hand, because there were very few customers, and on the other hand, the cinemas did not have new films, and the theaters could not invite famous actors, so they were all very desolate. The residents kept their doors closed all day and dared not go out; since the puppet authorities announced strict household registration checks, they have become more vigilant and worried about the misfortune that might suddenly befall them at any time.</p>
<p>Pan Yugui, the puppet police chief, once made a statement that four types of people were not protected: ❶ personnel of central direct organs, ❷ people in cultural circles, ❸ communists, ❹ members of the Blue Shirts Society. What he said included a very large part of the population of Beiping. The intention was to drive this large group of people away from Beiping. So, rumors arose: a certain party is planning to arrest someone, a certain party is planning to inspect a certain school, and so on. So, professors from various universities, students from various universities, and various people in the cultural circles all disguised themselves and fled to Tianjin. Among the professors, the more famous and the more resented by the Japanese and the traitors were mostly participating in the talks convened by the Central Government in Lushan at this time, which can be considered a fortunate thing; otherwise, people like Jiang Menglin, Hu Shi, and Gu Jiegang, who have always been regarded by the Japanese as anti-Japanese and by the traitors as ‘central派一’would probably be very dangerous at this time. On the school side, the four national universities and various private colleges did not suffer any damage and were still temporarily maintained by the original person in charge. Graduating and studying students were all issued graduation certificates and study certificates respectively. The salaries of teachers, staff and workers of the four national universities were completely paid in advance by the school from the deposit in July, because the monthly fee of 360,000 yuan for the Pingjin colleges in July was never remitted. Most of the schools have set up communication offices in Nanjing; the people left in the Beiping school look like they are finishing up. Most of the books and instruments of the schools, except for a small part that was sent out a long time ago, were not moved away. The Twenty-Ninth Army withdrew so quickly that everyone was caught in the hands of the enemy in a state of unpreparedness. This is a very painful thing! The puppet authorities have already stated that all books and instruments will be absolutely prohibited from being moved. The most embarrassing, the most dangerous, and also the most ridiculous thing in the cultural circles is the press. The press is the most well-informed, but this time, they also fell into the hands of the enemy in a muddle-headed state. Except for those who have been close to 方及 and a certain party, the rest are in great danger of being arrested. In fact, some were indeed detained by the enemy. When I left Beiping, I still did not know what had become of them. What is described above is the bright side; but on the dark side, there are also some measures that should be briefly described here. On the school side, it is said that the puppet authorities are also planning to run a university. When the reporter left, it seemed that they had not yet reached an agreement. I don't know what is happening now. Primary and secondary schools are all the same, and the puppet authorities continue to run them. However, the revision of textbooks goes without saying; secondly, the puppet authorities also issued an order prohibiting the teaching of those ‘unnecessary’ courses. What they meant was probably courses such as party doctrine and civics. As for newspapers, those run by the Japanese and the traitors, in addition to the original ones that continued, handed over some new ones (they are not affected by the shortage of paper, because they can transport paper from Japan, so they are still the original size). In addition, most of the other newspapers in Beiping are still published, but the content has completely changed, and most of the hosts have also changed.</p>
<p>What directly suffered from the enemy's burning and killing was the suburbs. On the afternoon of the tenth, the reporter risked taking an American's car to the western suburbs. Along the way for more than ten miles, the stench of corpses kept blowing. The driver, while driving, pointed to the new piles of dirt constantly seen on both sides of the road and told us the names of the people buried inside. He often takes this road, so all the dead are his acquaintances. The new tombs were buried by the Red Cross.</p>
<p>It has been many days since escaping from Beiping. The detailed situation in recent times is unknown; however, there is one thing I can be sure of: those compatriots who cannot escape must be looking forward to seeing the blue sky and white sun flag again all day long!</p>
<h3>The Planetary Politician of Japan: Ugaki Kazushige (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fei Dan</p>
<p>For the past five years, whenever there has been turmoil in the Japanese political situation, the name of Ugaki Kazushige, the former Governor-General of Korea who retired last year, the planetary politician, and the army general who rose from a Second Class Merit and Third Class, would immediately surface in the minds of the Japanese people, and rumors that Ugaki was about to form a new cabinet would immediately spread. Even if the political situation was calm and uneventful, if this Governor-General crossed the Tsushima Strait and ran back to Tokyo from Korea, there would immediately be rumors of political upheaval. However, in the past five years, Japan has undergone five coups, and the mantle of the Prime Minister has been passed from Saito to Okada to Hirota to Hayashi to Konoe, but it has not been Ugaki's turn. Although Ugaki was once ordered to organize a cabinet after Hirota resigned this spring, the opposition of the young officers of the military made it difficult for Ugaki to realize his ambitions. Ugaki was extremely resentful of his failure to form a cabinet, believing that he had lost the qualification to command the army as an army general opposed by the military, so he resigned his title as army general to the Emperor and retired to his farm.</p>
<p>However, after the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance against Japan in our country this time, there was another rumor that Ugaki was the commander of the Japanese army. Unexpectedly, before this news was confirmed, it was now rumored that Ugaki had been assassinated a few days ago. Although it is not known whether Ugaki was really assassinated, Ugaki has long been jealous of by the young military officers, and his assassination is very likely. I think everyone must be thinking, why do the young military officers of Japan hate Ugaki so much?</p>
<p>Before talking about the reasons why the young military officers hate Ugaki, let me first talk about Ugaki's brief history. Ugaki was born and graduated from Okayama Normal School, working as a poor elementary school teacher with a monthly salary of —six yuan. Later, he finally abandoned literature and took up arms, and was admitted to the Army Officer School, which he had been aspiring to. He graduated from the school in 1890 and became a lieutenant officer the following year. In the same year, he entered the Army University, the door to the Japanese Minister of the Army. After graduating from the Army University, he served as military attache in Germany, and after returning to China, he served as an adjunct to the General Staff Headquarters, director of the Military Affairs Section, director of the General Affairs Department of the General Staff Headquarters, principal of the Army University, commander of the Tenth Division, and vice minister of the Army. In 1934, on the recommendation of Tanaka, he served as the Minister of the Army in the Kiyoura Cabinet. Later, he continued to serve as the Minister of the Army in the first and second cabinets of Kato, and the cabinets of Wakatsuki and Hamaguchi. In 1931, Hamaguchi was assassinated, and he resigned from the post of Minister of the Army and went to Korea to be the Governor-General. He did this for five years, and finally returned to Tokyo last August, which shows that Ugaki has lived a smooth life.</p>
<p>In the past, the Japanese Minister of the Army was recommended by the military itself. Why is Ugaki, who was supported by the military in the past, now opposed by the military itself? This is what most people do not understand, and it is also the reason why Ugaki is a planetary politician. Ultimately, this cannot be said to be due to the times. Because although there are many reasons why the young officers oppose Ugaki, the main reasons can be said to be two: First, Ugaki sold out the army; second, Ugaki has too deep a relationship with the established political parties and financial groups. These two things are completely due to the times.</p>
<p>First, Ugaki is said to have sold out the army by the young officers because Ugaki followed the political parties' advocacy and implemented military reduction. Because Ugaki took office as the Minister of the Army not long after the end of World War I, and the atmosphere of peaceful military reduction permeated the world, the Japanese parliament was also affected by this peaceful atmosphere and advocated military reduction extremely strongly. Ugaki had to conform to the times and reduce the Japanese army from 21 divisions to 17 divisions. Originally, the ideal standard of Japanese military equipment was 25 army divisions and 500,000 tons of navy. The ministers of the military in the past regarded it as the golden rule. Ugaki's move to reduce the army naturally surprised the conservatives in the army. At the same time, the result of the military reduction was that many officers were unemployed and displaced. Their hatred of Ugaki is self-evident. But in fact, Ugaki has always advocated expanding the army. When he was the Minister of the Army in the past, he was the director of the Military Affairs Section of the Army Ministry at that time, and he strongly advocated increasing the army by two divisions: when Ugaki was the Minister of the Army, the times had completely changed. Not only was the peaceful military reduction movement extremely fierce, but from the experience of World War I, it was known that the future wars were not only about the number of troops, the quality of military equipment was also very important. At that time, when the atmosphere of military reduction was extremely strong, it was not easy to keep the military expenditure from being reduced. It was really very difficult to increase it. Under such circumstances, Ugaki could only reduce four divisions with the same amount of military expenditure and use the saved expenditure to strengthen military equipment. Although Ugaki's intention was not blameworthy, who would understand him? The result was that it gave the opportunity to those ambitious people who opposed him to use it, and gave him the hat of selling out the army. The hat of selling out the army made Ugaki lose the faith of the young officers, and the resentment of the young officers was concentrated on him.</p>
<h3>All Industries Securely Navigate the Mid-Autumn Festival Financial Settlement</h3>
<p>Ninety Percent of Debts Collected Through Transfers, Market Overdraft Rate Remains at Two Jiao</p>
<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival financial settlement for all industries. All money houses, companies, factories, and businesses have issued lists to their respective counterparties since the 15th. Starting today, personnel have been dispatched to collect debts as usual. ‘For counterparties in the war zone, due to unknown addresses, the method of advertising in newspapers is adopted to notify all counterparties to take care of commercial credit and automatically send the debts. However, at this extraordinary time, debt collection is quite difficult, and eighty or ninety percent of it is done through transfers. The four banks of Zhongzhong Jiaonong, in order to stabilize finance and regulate all industries, the lending committee established earlier is handling lending as much as possible. The reserve agency affiliated to the silver and money industry association is also doing its best to regulate member banks and houses, indirectly also to relieve industry and commerce. Therefore, the financial situation in Shanghai is still stable, and the market overdraft rate remains at two jiao.</p>
<h3>Trade Union Federation Investigates Unemployed Vegetable Workers</h3>
<p>Orders Subordinates to Report, So as to Coordinate Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labour Union, in view of the August 13th Shanghai battle outbreak, the expansion of the war zone, the closure of most factories in the city, and the huge number of unemployed workers, in order to understand the unemployment situation of workers in Shanghai, printed investigation forms, distributed them to each trade union for detailed completion, in order to compile statistics, and consulted with party and government organs, and relief organizations, to find ways to provide relief. However, as the addresses of the unions were mostly in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas, the forms could not be delivered. Although a few trade unions took the initiative to collect and fill out the forms, most of them still did not complete them. The union yesterday notified all trade unions to collect the forms from the union's temporary office (telephone 81441) within one week and fill them out in detail, so as to coordinate relief.</p>
<h3>China Youth Anti-Enemy Corps Mobile Propaganda in Inland Areas</h3>
<p>More Than Twenty Team Members, Scheduled to Depart This Morning</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai China Youth Anti-Enemy National Salvation Corps has sent more than two hundred people to work at the front. Recently, the Corps' propaganda team selected more than twenty team members with rich propaganda experience to form a mobile propaganda team to conduct propaganda in the inland areas, and organize the masses. They are scheduled to depart this morning (the 19th).</p>
<h3>Sufficient Fuel in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Total Coal Reserves Around 200,000 Tons, Firewood and Charcoal Shipped to Shanghai as Usual</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government attaches great importance to the supply of fuel. The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus have jointly formed a Fuel Committee to handle the supply of fuel. A reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the total coal reserves in Shanghai are about 200,000 tons, with bituminous coal being the majority and anthracite coal being the second largest. Now that factories in Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong have all closed down, and only a few factories in the concessions are operating, the demand for coal has been greatly reduced. The current coal reserves are sufficient to last for three to four months. The coal produced by the Kailuan Coal Mining Company in Qinhuangdao is still being shipped to Shanghai on British ships. At the same time, firewood and charcoal fuel are being shipped to Shanghai by inland river merchant ships. Therefore, there is no shortage of fuel in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Promoting National Products Association Requests Lower Lending Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Letter to the Bankers Association, Easing the Burden on the Light Industry Sector</p>
<p>The Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, in response to the requests of its member factories, yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Bankers' Association, requesting that it not raise lending interest rates, in order to ease the burden on the light industry sector. The original letter is as follows: Dear Sirs, we have repeatedly received reports from our member factories that the call loan interest rate in August has been increased. Our factories themselves have been hampered by the war, and sales have been obstructed, and accounts receivable cannot be recovered, and are on the verge of falling into difficulties. If the pressure of high interest rates is added, they will be even more overwhelmed. It is considered that the high lending interest rate directly increases costs and causes prices to rise, and indirectly affects social order and people's livelihood. It is requested that your industry improve this. Our association believes that this is an unprecedented difficult time for the factory sector. We have always admired your association's leadership as an industry, and its enthusiasm for patriotism. We also ask you to maintain the spirit of mutual cooperation, and allow a reasonable reduction in lending interest rates, so as to slightly ease the burden of our factory sector in the midst of hardship. This is also the intention of your association to take care of the national economy and people's livelihood. A corresponding letter is sent, and we hope for a reply.</p>
<h3>Escaped Passengers Recount the Moment of Bombing at Songjiang Station</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese army has disregarded public law and repeatedly bombed our civilians with airplanes, even women and children, and has been wantonly trampled on, which has been witnessed and heard by people from all walks of life at home and abroad, and has been frequently spurned. Here is a letter from Zhen Duan of Sanshan, recounting the bombing of Songjiang Station by enemy planes, which is specially published to show the general situation of the barbaric bombing by Japanese planes at that time. The letter says, 'On the 8th of this month, I took the Shanghai-Hangzhou early train, turned from Zhejiang to Fujian with my friend Mr. Lin, his wife, and fellow villagers, and boarded the train from the West Station. At that time, the passengers were already crowded, mostly refugees from various places, with no room to stand, so they took the baggage car. At noon, the train arrived at Songjiang and stopped at the station. Suddenly, eight enemy planes soared into the sky and flew low. A child in the same car peeked out and was shot by the enemy plane's machine gun and fell on the car. The crowd was about to rush out of the door when the third-class car was bombed and caught fire. The passengers on the car, men, women, old and young, were spared from the disaster. At that time, the car door of the luggage was already shaken open. I carried Mr. Lin's son on my back, jumped down, and crouched on the side of the road. I repeatedly heard loud bangs. Looking back, corpses were lying across the road. The open machine fired more than a dozen bombs one after another. The cries of the refugees shook the fields, which was unbearable to hear. After the enemy planes bombed, their barbaric hearts did not stop at all, and they used machine guns to strafe the women and children who were hiding and crawling in the fields, and countless people were killed. There were also refugees who jumped into the water in an attempt to escape, and they were not allowed to live, and they were bombed with giant bombs in the water. Only the splashes of water were seen, the river was all red, and the corpses were rolling and floating on the water. It is estimated that this time, the cruel enemy killed and injured countless people and destroyed five or six vehicles. The cruelty has reached this point. Our group of eight people, except for Mr. Lin who was bombed and died on the spot, there were two seriously injured, who were carried to the hospital by the local Red Cross. One person was slightly injured, and a machine gun bullet pierced his left arm. As for Mr. Lin's wife and I, we were fortunate enough to be reborn. On the morning of the 9th, we returned to Shanghai and passed by the Puji Nursing Home in Minhang. We asked them to treat the machine gun bullet that pierced his arm. The doctors and staff of the hospital warmly received us, applied medicine, gave us a feast, and prepared a car to send us to Shanghai. After the disaster, our frightened souls were settled. We hereby describe the cruel behavior of the Japanese army that we witnessed, to tell the people of the country, and express our gratitude to the doctors and staff of the Puji Nursing Home for their kindness and compassion.</p>
<h3>'I have already dedicated myself to the country and the nation'</h3>
<p>— Lü Wenting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper published a long letter from Minzi, the wife of enemy Captain Maojio Taozaosuke, which contained 'I hope you have the spirit of Sergeant Kurosaki escaping from death.' In the wounded soldiers' hospital founded by the Ren Sheng 𣃮 Xing Tuan, there is a warrior of ours, Jiang Junde, who has dedicated himself to the country and wants his fiancée to marry someone else. In contrast, this is a powerful guarantee that 'the final victory belongs to us'.</p>
<p>Ms. Lü Wenting is the founder of Youde Elementary School. Now this school may have been destroyed by artillery fire, so she volunteered to join the hospital as a nurse. This text was written by her. — Editor's Note</p>
