<h3>廣九路快車失愼之教訓</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>日前廣九路快車由港開省。於石龍附近忽兆焚如。客車三輛。均被燒燬。死傷人數。竟至逾百。誠行車絕大之不幸。輓近罕過之慘劇也。災事發生以後。遐邇為之聳動。或則悼心失圖於暴珍之難復。或則呻痛吟楚於創傷之煎迫。慘戚之象。自無待書。卽非身丁其厄之輩。本諸人類互助之原則出於呴濡同情之感應。對茲突發之禍變亦有不能釋然者。吾人為懲前毖後計極欲有切實之討論以喚起各方之注意據臆伸懷敢辭喋喋。</p>
<p>火車為縮短時空之利器實吾人必要之企求處人事接構殷繁之今日其功用乃彌膾炙於人口。所給予之利便固大。所包含之危險，性亦多。小之如撞斃人命。大之則出軌傾覆。而中途匪徒之攔刦。車頭之互撞。並有其突發之可能。據京滬路局統計。二十四年度中。行車傷斃命。竟達三百有二十人。更就去年一年內火車失事而論。則有京滬路貨車之切軸。平綏路貨車之出軌。機車之互撞。隴海路兩車之互撞。同薄路兵車之出軌。貨車之失愼。而津浦粵漢兩路之撞車案。尤轟動一時之耳目。查德國於一八八九年全國一千一百萬之乘客中。無辜死者一人。至一九三○年迄一九三二年。三年內共有乘客千五百萬兆。死者乃祗三人。至其他救濟方法之層出。更足以遏阻一切之困難。德為科學前進國家。其突飛猛晋之程序。誠非吾國所能相提並論。然而由此可證鐵道交通之安全。端藉人力為推動。斯固吾人所應深思熟慮。勉圖改進者也。</p>
<p>關於行車安全問題。鐵部早經通令各路。予以注意。行車之設備。員工之考騐。職守之調查。並在軫懷關念之列。此次廣九路慘劇。據開起於盥洗室中化學用品之爆炸。而車上復未裝有報急機關。一時無從警告司機。逐令火勢蔓延。一發莫收。藉令事先有嚴密之檢點。當不致任令化學用品漫置盥洗所內。藉令車上有周全之設備。則停車施行灌救。可使乘客不遭殃及。須知失愼非撞車可比。施救有人事可盡。何至有七十七人之慘死。三十五人之灼傷。召如斯嚴重之結果哉。覆轍之禍。旣已莫挽於過去。補牢之圖。應知警惕於來日。如何力求人事之訓練。是在於當局之切實圖其整頓矣。</p>
<h3>英德駐意大使負責要使命返國</h3>
<p>研究意德對西班牙方案　從排俄以解决歐洲問題</p>
<p>［羅馬］重要外交行動現在秘密進行中、英駐意大使德鲁蒙與德駐意大使哈塞尔、同时分道往倫敦柏林、當攜有意首相墨索里尼與德航空部長戈林商妥之解决西班牙問題方案、前途發展頗堪注意、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］事業報外交記者塔布衣夫人頃發表一文、就德意兩國談話及西班牙內戰問題、有所論列、內稱“德國航空部長戈林將軍與意相墨索里尼此次在羅馬會晤時、曾擬有一種計書、主張由英德意三國進行談話、并主張先行討論西班牙內亂問題、然後再將保障安全問題、原料與殖民地重行分配問題、曁財政經濟問題、次第提出討論、英國倘能表示同意、卽當邀請法國參加談話、一俟法國接受之後、更當邀請波蘭出而參加、但無論如何、務當擯絕蘇聯、預料英國駐意大使德魯蒙爵士、日內當非正式向英國政府提出報告、”塔布衣夫人又謂、關於西班牙問題，英國某某方面亟望、由英德意三國先行發表宣言、聲明西班牙境內、惟有由溫和派組成政府、各該國始能承認、果爾、則其他各國當能會同英德意三國、擬定一種程序、以為綏靖西班牙時局之計、然後乃當召集國際會議、傳將此項計畫、付諸實施云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［柏林］漢堡自由報頃就德國航空部長戈林將軍與意國當局進行談話一事、發表一文、顯係半官方面授意而作、內容略謂、寗總兩國談話結果、業已組成精神上聯合陣線、戈林此次前往意國、係屬私人旅行性質、固屬毫無疑義、但渠此行、已使意德兩國外交政策相並而行、并在精神上、為此項並行政策、樹立基礎、則可斷言、意相墨索里尼前於本月十六日、向德國民衆觀察報訪員發表談話時、曾謂“吾人旣知布爾希維克主議乃係威脅吾人文化與生命之唯一危險、自不免感覺歐洲各國有聯合應付之必要”云、可見德國國社黨當局前於去年九月間在紐倫堡大會指責蘇聯各部、頗為意國當局所歡迎、而意德兩國、鑒于共產主義有以西班牙為出發點而攻擊歐洲各國之虞、爰乃在友好精神之中、相互接近也，至就英國而論、意德兩國所組成之軸心、與英意兩國地中海協定、并無牴觸之處、英國對於西班牙伐朗西亞政府、現方繼續予以承認、然當顧及意國依照君子協定、雖已應允尊重地中海現狀、但西班牙境內若果樹立蘇維埃共和國、或加泰隆自治邦成為赤色北和邦、則决非意國所能相與妥協也”云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>銅元兌價難復　原因在收買鎔燬　投下資本法幣一千元　可獲毛利七十元左右</p>
<p>近來鋼元兌價暴縮、初時－般心理、認為時局影響、不久卽可回復原狀、孰料目前風聲已平、而銅元兌價依然止於二千九百文左右、此雖因歲暮年底小有關係、但幕後實有種種重大原因、依筆者目光、前途難有回復之望、蓋自法幣推行、當然收回舊銅元、加以改鑄而便實現新貨幣、久之市上舊銅元自必减少但關鍵尚不止此、則因有人對銅元投機、於中牟利、投機者手續亦殊簡單、不過招覓受主、較為困難耳、今者時異勢遷、形式與重量、民衆之心理銅價之步漲，工廠之重視原料、一部份遂使行投機手叚、藉以博得微利、積少成多、盈餘亦極可觀，而銅元兌價、因是而難復矣、今再明言其投機之一法如次、</p>
<p>試以法幣一元、向烟兌業兌換、則得銅元二千九百文之譜、其中銅元種類、殊為繁複、但以質量分辨·則祗厚與薄之兩種耳、依現在情形、厚紫銅元與薄銅元約為七與三之比、設有人以法幣一千元、兌取銅元二千九百萬文（其中含有三成薄銅元、）而檢出其中簿銅元、約計八百七十萬文、轉輾換取厚紫銅元（每法幣約損失貼水一分、大致需換四次•可以換凈•）則損失法幣五元六角二分半如是成本為一千零零五元六角二分半，不過先前薄銅元八百七十萬文、現已挽得厚銅元矣、薄銅元與厚者重量之比、約為八成、則此厚銅元八百七十萬文之重量、等於一千零八十七萬五千文、加上原有厚銅元二千零三十萬文、等於三千一百十七萬五千文、普通銅廠買價、銅元每千文為三角四分半左右、（市價法幣一元兌銅元二千九百文也）則此人所有銅元三千一百十七萬九千文、售予銅廠、可得法幣－千零七十五元五角餘、除本金一千零零五元六角半、可獲利七千元左右之毛利矣、此不過大略情形而己投機者之手段方法、能使人不可捉摸也</p>

<p>昨日華商證券交易所公債市塲、趨勢續見下游、人氣亦頗感虛萎，多空雙方、掉期交易尚稱踴躍、惟因某大戶續有大量實貨套售於近期、檯面籌碼、供求不勻、市價復趨降跌、散戶則仍有收買、故午後市况、略呈堅定昨日上午開盤、市况極為疲軟、四十七號代某金融大戶專收丙種近期、而拋賣戊丁等四種、散戶則頗有買進、故市價僅丙種好五分、餘均降落一角至四角、次盤四十七號續見大批套賣戊丙種五十•七十二號等收買甚湧、戊甲等下跌五分至四角、乙丙種則回漲五份下午開盤、趨勢漸有盤旋、四十七十一•二十三號等賣出不少散戶及五十號等仍有收進、戊丁丙種上漲五分一角、乙甲等又疲一角左右、收盤行市尚稱平堅、四十七號續有套售、七十七•七十二號收購甚湧、市價均上升五分至一角半、全日結果、一律下降五分至四角半、丙種本月則好二角、成分總數計七百二十七萬元、茲將其漲跌高低比較列表如左、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗銷沉寂　期紗交易尤感缺乏</p>
<p>三品雖漲：僅帶起數角行情</p>
<p>紗市平庸、氣勢穩靜、蓋以總結賬期將屆、紗銷沉寂、客帮俱無動辯之意、因此人心閒散、多空兩方皆無意活動、故交易甚稀、市價更乏甚大變遷也、至於多方、對於二月期拉緊仍不放棄、然有一部份獨賣二月、前途若何殊難逆料、總之實需為根本問題也、</p>
<p>標紗獨小二月期　標紗前市開盤、近期銷昂、遠期平凡、一盤後、聞天孤一品紗本月漲四元外、遠漲二•元外、人氣轉趨堅挺、浮空稍有抵補、市價回升幾角、但塲內成交殊感烯少、上下不大、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲三四•五•角、午後開盤三品紗來電再漲三•四元、市氣復升數角、但成交仍解，未幾聞現紗交易五百包未滿、牧盤再入疲境、然大阪三品紗收盤再昂•結果比上日漲四元至九元六角外、標紗結果三月比上午收盤價漲二角、二•四月跌三•五角、查賣出生源一千一百包、聚與七百五十包、振大六百元十包、大昶七百包，錦昌五百包、賡豐四百死十包、恒益三百五十包、福康三百五十包、買進合興九百五十包、元一四百五十包、潤康六百五十包、仁豐五百包，永昌七百包、同和八百包、茲將一日問最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<p>棉市形同停頓</p>
<p>棉市不脫盤族之局、大勢亳無榮辱可言、市塲一片散漫之象、終日間之差價、僅在一、二角之間，足見人心怠鬆、同時現棉交易呆頓、廠胃閉塞矣、</p>
<p>標花升降範圍愈狹　標花前市開盤、各月平澹無勁、市塲異常渙散、絕無振作氣象、美棉雖升一•二磅音、印棉大跌二•三羅比、於是人心平常、塲中買賣尤缺、惟大阪三品花漲三•四•六角、散空略補、回好五分、結果各月比上日收盤價漲五分、午後開盤、三品花來電雖再漲、然市塲依然冷澹、一盤後絕少起伏、市態益覺呆木、結果近月比上午收盤價跌一角、遠月勿動、查賣出裕大三千三百擔、豐泰二千一百擔、泰昌一千九百擔、益昶一千九百擔、潤康一千二百擔、長和二千四百擔、明德九百擔、源大九百擔、賡豐九百擔、振大九百擔買進大昌成三千八百擔、大孚九百擔、合興二千六百担、森康九百担、愼記一千二百担、泰興一千一百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>棉花祇有一筆交易　現棉消費澹泊、廠需停頓、來源姚花一千五百六十八包、通花一千九百八十二包、沙市花　五一•○○　民豐廠進五四○○件　現貨棧交</p>
<p>印度棉農奮賣不絕</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因利物浦電訊不佳、汽車罷工欠利、多頭了結及棉農糞賣、各月跌三至七磅昔、在借欵棉花問題未有解决以前、商人大都採取觀望態度、其後，近月有廣大同業需要、惟新戶仍缺、同時、有若干掉期、亦有買進十月期棉花、以抵售出九月期棉干油者、低級現棉之脚地較軟、收擊時空戶抵補、同業眼價買進、趨勢甚堅、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨跌一磅音至漲二磅音、英棉現貨跌四點·期貨跌一點、印棉初因空戶拋售而疲、旋以本地廠家買進而回、卒因棉農套賣再疲、計平果兩跌一•五至二•五羅比•奧姆辣跌二至二•五羅比•白羅溪跌一•七五至二羅比、原電錄左、（十八日電）</p>

<p>漢口快信、本市棉花市况尚穩、產區粗細絨來源皆有、銷塲以申帮及出口商搜辦最強、裕華紗廠及日商•日信•東棉洋行等亦有購進、故各方去路尚稱不呆、共成交折合市秤為六千零五十八担、又八千斤、售價視前提高一•二角不等、又訊棉布自新年以來，客胃疲滯、花色及細布間有零星交易外、粗布問津者頗鮮•布價因紗價不振•每疋下落五分至數角不等云、</p>

<p>昨日粉市上午開盤、各月份又呈一致慘跌無神之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥微好四八分不等、坎拿大跌二角左右、當開價後、因洋麥出入尚少、人心尚定、惟本月份因近交割、實銷方面、依然停寂、致業外浮多、已擯無可擯、不得不逐步脫手、是以人心大虛、市面遂一瀉千里、莫可換救、因投機多頭、與客帮交易、究竟不同、一則可以抽裝、一則純以營利為目的、初未顧及銷塲也、迨至下午開盤、市面之跌度、更見狂暴、一二月份之開價、竟較前日跌一角而停柏、幸三月份因人心較定、未到限度、故至二盤、進期廢方已起而抵䋠、多頭方面、逐稍延殘喘、較最低時微好近分、據業中之推測、以為實銷不活、市面仍難站住云、</p>

<h3>戰時的財政</h3>
<p>— 奚東曙</p>
<p>信用的膨脹、物質的上漲，以及公價　　的消耗，均足以加重政府戰時財政上負担，還不如加稅之簡截了當，因為政府的購買力一减低，對於人力與物力的使用，卽處於不利的地位，物價高漲，使農民在生活上，感覺極端的痛苦，還不必論，與債不如加稅，已為一般經濟家所公認，有人謂戰爭，非僅求現代人民的生存，也是謀後代人民的利益，不如先與債，而讓後代人分任一部份的負担，豈不知現代的戰爭，是衝環不斷的，後代人，或將有他們的負担，不能將現代經濟的負担，推到後世，且持有公債的人，在戰時未作若何犧牲，及坐食其利，更造成經濟上不公平的担負，公債不過是賦稅一時的替身，公債的歸宿，畢竟是賦稅，如舉債以付戰費，必煩同時增加稅收，使足以償付公債的利息，及一部份的債本，否則政府的信用，必為之動搖，使以後不能冉發公債，正屬作繭自縛，故籌畫戰時財政之健全的方法，就是要高度的加稅使其加無可加，而用公債，以濟其臨時的急需，以補其不足之數務使公債的發行，在可能範圍內，限於最低的額數，前英國首相魯易喬治，在一九一四年十一月間，提出增稅案於國會時，曾經聲述，“戰時應提高稅率，俟和平恢復時，再使之减低，此法較易，因一般國民，在戰爭期間，愛國之心，油然而生，不惜犧牲一切。”英國在歐戰中，始終就竭力增加租稅以支付戰費，其戰費中租稅所佔的成份，比較歐洲所有交戰國為最大，以後美國也同樣的注重租稅，故英美兩國，在戰後得容易使其財政與經濟，恢復常軌，德國自始卽未加稅，完全以公債支付戰費，希望戰勝後，取償於敵國，至開戰後第三年，方决定加稅，法國也趨重公債一途，雖屬戰勝，而戰後財政異常的紊亂，經過很長時期的整理，方入正軌，德國自不必言，我們有此前車才鑒，在這未雨綢繆的時候，應當下一加稅的决心，作相當直接稅徵收的準備，按英國在戰時，直接稅是戰稅百分之七十三，美國戰時的直接稅，佔戰稅百分之七十九，可見直接稅地位的重要，我們在此時，應急速的籌設直接稅的機構，以期將來可收速效，現將各種戰時可以利用的直接稅，略為申述。</p>
<p>（一）所得稅，此稅在世界各國，施行已久，實為一種最合理的稅，幸政府已决意採用，誠加立法委員陳長蘅所云（一）所得稅范圍廣大，適合租稅普及之原則，（二）所得稅依人民負担能力之大小，而定差別稅額，適合租稅公平之原則，（三）收入豐富，適合租稅豐富之原則（四）所得稅基於人民確實之所得而征收，適合一租稅確實之原則，（五）所得稅富伸縮性，各國常以為調劑國家收支之適合，親兄弟為所得稅之伸縮性，在戰時至為重要，歐戰中，英國所得稅最高時，每廿先令，須徵收十先令六便士，美國所得稅的最高峯，達百分之七十七，此類有彈性的直接稅，最合非常時期中財政的需要。（未完）</p>

<h3>榮宗敬發表瓊州植棉意見</h3>
<p>氣候土質適宜增產額　自給出口與世界競爭</p>
<p>實業界鉅子榮宗敬氏、發表建議瓊州植棉意見云、吾華以農立國稻麥在農產中•占重要地位、桑次之、棉又次之、自紡織業興、國人始注意植棉、惟產量有限、原料多數取給國外成為絕大漏巵、近年政府復興農村、</p>
<p>提倡國貨植棉　遂有突飛進步、上年產額竟打破以前紀錄、然六十支以上原料、猶付缺如、蓋氣候土質與農產有密切關係、如魯、如豫、如陝、雖棉種傳播收獲已豐而氣候土質大率宜粗種、不宜細種、以吾國土地之大、求其氣候土質適宜細種、可得鉅量產額者、厥為瓊州•瓊州為中國銀行宋董事長之故鄉、宋氏此次巡視所得、已一一被露報端、且有開拓計劃、目光遠大、極端欽佩•本人（榮氏自稱）經營紗業、覺植</p>
<p>棉為紗廠命脈　觀於瓊州之氣候土質、培植埃及海島棉種以後、吾國細紗原料、絕對不生問題、本人對此事躊躇已久、因未得發表機會遂致默爾、數年前無錫有尤惜陰者、人極篤實於農業有特殊興趣、曾親赴瓊州試種棉花、成績極佳、據云、一月下種、六月收花不遇風雨、鈴大如桃、纖維一寸三分至一寸七分、可紡八十支細紗、每株高可三四尺、如叢生之樹、經冬不凋、可連續二三年、惟不花果、尤君所言如是惜當時因經濟及人事方面、無人援助、未能繼續研究、今宋氏旣有開拓瓊州之决心、則植棉似為當今急務、鄙意玆事體大、應由棉統會主持、派</p>
<p>專家實地調查　切實進行、先從宣傳入手、使當地農民、瞭然於植棉之利益、較任何農產品為優、一面組織合作社、集中經濟人才、自購種以至收獲、應全神貫注、增加信用、以圖擴充、利用天時、以盡地力、年產一百五十萬包、華廠六十支以上、</p>
<p>原料取給有餘　出數大增、可供出口、與世界產棉國競爭、且六月收花、正青黃不接之時、得此新棉為世界占先一着、辦理得人、成效可操左券、現今歐美各國、莫不競事植棉、强盛國家、莫不棉產豐富、卽如我國、今年棉產加增、農村商業有昭蘇氣象、植棉之關係國運如此、國人允宜重視、前值民廿年水災時、本人曾購棉籽二百噸、運赴魯豫陝各省播種、於農村與商業、已著成效、若瓊州實行植棉、其福利更什倍於此也云云、</p>

<p>經營經過　交通部為謀歐亞兩洲間空中交通之實現起見、於十九年、與德國漢沙航空公司（Deutsche　LmfthansaA.G.）訂立歐亞航空郵運合同、由交通部出資二百萬元、（現增至六百萬元、）漢沙出資一百萬元、（現增至三百萬元、）依中華民國法律、創立歐亞航空公司、（Eurasia　Aviation　Corporation）籌辦由上海至柏林之航空綫、其實施之步驟、係以先自經營中國國內航綫為始、並以上海為起點、漸進通至中俄邊境、然後再謀直接通至柏林、其合同內、原定應採之航綫如下、一•從上海經南京•天津、北平•及滿洲里•經亞洲俄國至歐洲、二•或從上海•經南京•天津•北平•及庫倫以外之中國邊境、經亞洲俄國至歐洲、三•或從上海•經南京•甘肅•及新疆•之中國邊境經亞洲俄國至歐洲、公司成立於二十年二月、經過相當之積極籌備、於同年五月、卽在上列第一綫內、卽上海至滿洲里間、作定期之飛航、惜未及四月、因滿洲之事變而中輟、滿洲事變後、公司立卽從事於第三綫之經營、此綫多係叢山交錯、荒漠橫亘、氣候惡劣、人跡罕至之區、對於機塲之開闢、房屋之建築、以及組織電信運輸•儲存油料•及換用機件等、備極艱難、但於二十一年四月、卽已開始上海至蘭州二千公里一段之定期飛航、至二十二年六月、卽已正式通至迪化、不幸同年九月起、此綫蘭州至迪化之一段、又因新疆境內發生含有國際性之政治障礙而中斷、公司於遭遇兩次含有國際性之障礙之後、一面積極從事國內航綫之發展、以資調劑、而靜待新疆政局之轉桂、一面又尋覓途徑、另謀由中國西南邊境、取道亞洲南部、以通至歐洲•但三年以來、新疆仍暫無復航之可能、而亞洲南部之通過、亦因國際情形之複雜、倘在研討期中、未能卽時實現、故公司現時之經營、仍係暫以國內航綫為主、</p>
<p>航綫現狀　公司之國際航綫　目前雖尚未通達、而五六年來、在中國國內所經營之航綫、則已有長足之發展、計除由上海至俄邊之滬新綫、因新疆不能通過、自二十二年十月起、僅能繼續經營至蘭州為止外、曾於二十三年五月、添辦平粵綫、同年十一月完成蘭包綫、又於二十四年九月開辦陝蓉綫、以上各綫、均繼續經營、迄今無阻、惟平粵綫、自二十四年七月起、僅飛行北平至鄭州一段、在二十四年之末、交通部令本公司籌劃代辦京滇航綫、係以通至昆明為目的、經本年二月試航之結果、决定卽將陝蓉綫展長至昆明、已於去年四月一日起正式通航、定為陜滇綫、西安事變發生、西安蘭州兩處暫時無法通航、自二十五年十二月十五日起、遵交通部令、在陝邊未完全解决前、本公司之航綫除西安蘭州兩處、暫不經停外、其餘各站、均照常通航、並增設太原一站、</p>
<p>設備改進　一•公司對於各機塲、不時予以改善及擴大、除在上海機塲、裝有照明設備、以求夜間航行之安全外、更在上海龍華機塲中、建築巨大之飛機棚廠、方於去年六月告成、計費時六月建築費用、共達十五萬元之鉅、該廠能同時儲藏巨型機三架、並附有修理廠•電信間•職員辦公室•及設備精緻之待客室、其設計之周密、布置之精美•以及外廓之偉大、在遠東堪稱獨步、且公司所有航綫、大部來往於西北邊陲、航程長而又艱、陸地交通、最感困難、設若事先不詳為籌劃、殊難使公司業務進展、其於油料一項為最、故公司為謀飛行安全計、特斥巨資在西安、建築巨大地下油池三座、每座可容納油量五十噸、依目前所有飛機之用油估計、則僅西安一處所存之油、足敷五個月之用、故公司對於西北航程上、决無中途用油缺乏之虞、二•電信設備、在二十五年以前、飛機上及陸地均裝置長波電臺、蓋長波較短波為穩定而準確、然長波之射程、則不若短波之遙遠、且易受天電之擾亂、公司大部航綫、均在西北、氣候甚為惡劣、且兩站間之距離甚遠、為求航行之安全、特在飛機及陸地電臺上、均添裝短波電臺、如此、則長短波之功盡收、其弊盡棄矣、更以成都昆明間•及西安蘭州間、增設氣象電臺四所、故去年度內、各路班機、從未有因氣候障礙、而致誤時者、截至去年底止、公司所有電臺如下、1上海•2南京•3鄭州•4觀音堂•5西安•6鳳翔•7漢中•8蘭州•9靜寗•10肅州•11安西•12寗夏•13包頭•14成都•15宜賓•16廣漢•17•廣元•18昆明•19宣威•20北平•21漢口•22太原、再巨型機上、係裝有覓地定向器、（卽由飛機自行測知其目的地、）較通空定向、（卽由陸地定向電臺、測知方向、通知飛機者、）為迅速而準確、該器能利用各地廣播及電臺定向、其定向方法、以聽覺或視覺辨別方向、僅以一開闢變換之、故極迅速而簡便、三•公司在二十年開辦之初所用飛機、僅為容克斯Junkers　F18及W33两种、及至二十二年三月、滬新綫全綫通航之始、為適應西北之地形及氣候起見、卽開始於滬新綫之西段、改用容克斯W34、惟以上各機均不甚大、客貨不能多載、且設備亦不見完善、公司鑒於營業之向上、客貨月有增加、航綫亦漸次展長及擴大、有增加載量及减少航時之需要、陸續添備容克斯Ju52號式之發動機之巨型飛機數架、配置於各航綫直至去年底止、所有公司各航綫完全採用巨型機飛行、</p>
<p>業務概况　公司為提高一般乘客對於空中旅行之信仰、及業務之發展計特與德國許杜加爾特聯合保險股份有限公司，Allianz　und　StuttgarterVerein　versicherungsA.G.訂立合同對於普通航空乘客、設立意外保險、此項保險、包括收費、免費•减費•之一切乘客、其主要賠償條件、為A死亡一萬元、中國法幣、B完全殘廢一萬元、C因傷致短時期內完全不能工作時、每日給付至多十元之養傷費、此種保險、完全由公司義務代客辦理、并不收任何費用、卽乘客除支付額定之票價外、亦不必再付保險費、而可享受此種意外賠償之權利、此種制度、在吾國尚屬創見、為該公司所特有之優點、二•公司之至要使命、在謀溝通歐亞兩洲之空中交通、然因環境特殊、終未能全部暢通是為憾事、而公司現所經營之國內航綫、適均在中國邊陲、文化商業•均較落後之區、多屬高原山區、或沙漠地帶、地形氣候、均極惡劣、公司在此經營五六年來、在營業上、竟能獲取不斷之進步、各年中載運數字、有顯著穩定之增漲、尤其在本年內增漲之率、比較已往各年為著、茲列表比較如下、</p>
<p>有×附號者、卽僅統計至二十五年十一月止、其十二月份因時怱促未及補入、</p>
<p>將來計劃　公司將來業務之發展、除於短期內恢復平粵綫外、並努力實現國際航郵、平粵綫、現時僅飛行於北平鄭州一段、去年粵漢鐵路全綫通達、將來於客貨載運發展、自可預期、故公司擬先由鄭州展長至漢口、業已呈請交通部核准中、一俟奉准、計劃就緒、最短期內、卽可實現、滬新綫可通至俄邊、則由上海至德國柏林之航程、最多祇須五日、此在二十二年九月、該公司三架容克斯W84由柏林飛滬、巴有三次之事實、可以證明、又如另由上海取道緬甸印度而往柏林、則亦祗須七日或八日可達、此又有二十三年九月及二十四年八九兩月歷次Ju52號大型機來滬之事實、可資證明、公司為期有副社會中外人士之望、仍望繼續努力、謀滬新全綫之復航、以促歐亞間五日到達國際航郵運送之實現、惟新疆情形特殊、短期間內實難實現、但公司亦擬以滬滇為基礎、另謀由昆明直出緬印以達歐陸航綫之可能、是尚賴於政府當局之提携、與乎社會人士之協作、有以促成之云、</p>

<h3>葉開鑫控杜宇飛</h3>
<p>合辦女體育學校　追償積欠之欵項</p>
<p>在民國史上有歷史之湘軍健將葉開鑫、字競秋、自解除四十四軍軍長職務後、雖任軍事參議院上將參議、但係閑散之職、故曾在滬作寓公法律系學院全盛時代、葉應時勢之趨勢在滬西康腦脫路金司徒廟創設江南學院、自為董事長滬律師郭衛•曾一度任院　　開辦未有三年、因學額及成績不佳、奉</p>
<p>部令停辦　葉遂與杜宇飛合辦中國女子體育專鬥師範學校、茲葉開鑫委託其江南畢業高足汪勵吾律師、在地方法院對杜宇飛求償㊀欠欵二萬六千八百四十三元、並自二十四年六月一日起、至執行終了日止按月一分五厘之利息、㊁確認賠償損害之責任、㊂判令交出其所管理之中國女子體育專門學校之</p>
<p>賬簿清理　等中、其訴狀事實稱、杜宇飛於民國二十四年三月四日與原告訂立合辦中國女子體育專門師范學校契約、卽以廣告所有之江南學院租地所造之房屋以及一切動產、（包括器具圖書）作價八萬元因雙方合辦關係、被告應付給原告國幣四萬元、但被告因一時不易凑集、故由被告與原告約定</p>
<p>分期拔付　辦法、詎被告僅陸續付與原告一萬三千一百五十七元、以後到期、竟均失約、計尚欠原告二萬六千八百四十三元，未經付清、屢向催索、一味延約、故提起上項請求之訴訟云云、昨日上午袁推事開庭、葉開鑫未到、由代理律師代到陳述原告年四十九歲、湖南人往南京太平橋四號、並陳述</p>
<p>起訴情形　而被告亦未到、委由蔡曉白律師到庭稱、當合辦中國女子體育專門師範學校、因專門兩字•不合章程、批駁不准、因此並未開辦、卽無合夥性質、根本並無賠償可言、及給付欠欵之事實、而因不能開辦之故、被告將自辦二三十年之中國女子體育學校老招牌掛起開辦、故與原告並無</p>
<p>絲毫關係　是以僅能作轉租校舍關係、况葉因建築江南學院欠建築公司欵項、已經判决、由吳凱聲律師來函通知、如有債務則止付、同時原告又將該項學舍抵押於鹽業銀行、亦來函通知保留債權、故根本不能向被告提起訴訟云云、至此、庭論改期再訊、</p>
<h3>無頭箱屍案上訴根弟盡翻前供</h3>
<p>以前所述全屬子虛　宣告訊結定期宣判</p>
<p>公共租界工部局法律部、因不服第一特區法院對無頭箱屍案犯林根弟•(女)茅阿根•蔣元英•宣告無罪之判决、提起上訴、業由高二分院一度開庭調查、各情已誌本報、昨日午後、復由高二分院刑庭長郁華、偕聶•蕭•兩推事曁林檢察官開刑一庭續訊、茅阿根之律師及法院指定為林根弟•蔣元菼•辦護之律師馮樹華均出庭、先由捕房律師甘鏡先陳述</p>
<p>上訴理由　（已見前報從略）後、而始終承認與茅阿根蔣元菼殺死彩英之林根弟、亦突然翻供、據稱關終所供殺死彩英之事、實屬完全子虛、係因受刑不過乃胡亂訴說、根本我與彩英並不相識、素未謀面卽存福里一號、亦從未去過、庭上卽詢以旣無此事、則在</p>
<p>未破案前　為何在卡德路烟紙店門口對開無軌電車者說出殺人之事、而林亦予以否認、總之將以前歷次所供、全部推翻、連稱冤枉、誌之茅阿根•蔣元菼仍一貫以前主張、堅加不認、繼由庭上飭傳存福里管赤人葉奎玉等到案、亦稱並無彩英住於該里三號屋內、郁庭長乃諭令</p>
<p>開始辯論　先由捕房甘律師辯論一過•請求廢棄原判决、治林等以應得之罪、繼由范剛律帥為茅阿根辯護、略謂、捕房之上訴、完全基於林根弟之供詞、今林旣盡翻前供、則其上訴根本無立足之地、卽依林前之供述亦與事實不相符、如日期之前後矛盾、及稱當往殺彩英時見彩英蒙被</p>
<p>臥於牀上　焉有在九十度氣候之時、而尚蒙被而臥之理、且華界調查戶口殊嚴、焉有人敢將房屋私自出租之理、况被上訴人均稱供詞係出於刑求、故上訴人之上訴、顯無理由、應請將上訴駁回云云末由馮律師辦論一過、郁庭長卽宣告終結，定二十六日下午二時宣告判决、</p>

<h3>怎樣使民衆信仰國貨？</h3>
<p>— 國維</p>
<p>自從民元以來，貿易入超•一年增加一年，目前入超額，已達每年數萬萬元之鉅；若長此以往，則再隔一二十年後，入超額將增加至百萬萬或千萬萬的數目，試想我們中國，有多大的財力，能負起這樣重漏巵的擔負呢？那時中國，卽使不被人用武力併吞，也勢必生貧血症而自亡。所以現在國內有識之士，都感覺到提倡國貨實是救國圖存基本的要務，但是提倡國貨，話可很容易講，而事實上卻很難實行，大原因是因為外貨在華勢力的龐大，和大多數民衆對於國貨缺乏信抑的緣故，所以我們要提倡國貨，必先把障礙國貨發達的病源去掉，就是說㊀要縮小或至絕滅外貨在華勢力，㊁要使民衆對於國貨生信仰心。至於要講到怎樣縮小外貨勢力，這是政府的事，姑且撇開不談，我們要研究的是怎樣使民衆對於國貨生信仰心？以作者的意思，應照下列兩法進行；茲分別寫在後面，以供國貨界同人的參考。</p>
<p>一積極宣傳：在現代工商業競爭中，宣傳是佔有很重要的地位，國貨要和外貨競爭，也自然要借重宣傳的力量，宣傳的功用可使民衆對於國貨多一層認識，誘導民衆走上對於國貨生信仰的途徑，宣傳的方法可分：㊀時常舉行國貨展覽會；㊁發行大量刊物介紹各種國貨和討論如何改善國貨等，並要求國內報章雜誌對於國貨廣告與以優待；㊂歡迎個人或團體至國貨廠家參觀並將有價值國貨製造情形，攝成影片，時往學校，公園，舟車等公共塲所開映：㊃雖在窮鄉僻巷之處，時常須派人携帶國貨樣品去作宣傳等工作。</p>
<p>二務求出品精良，價格低廉：若宣傳得法，民衆對於國貨更有想相當認識。若再加國貨能有優良的品質糧低廉的價格，那麼民衆的信仰心自然發生了，反之若是宣傳很得法，而品質低劣或價值過昂貴，那麼非但民衆對於國貨永遠不生信仰，並且反而增加他們對於外貨的信仰力，這是最危險不過的了。</p>
<p>總之，我們要希望提倡國貨，必先博得民衆的信仰心。有了信仰心，民衆便自然樂用國貨外貨也自然歛跡。國家，社會，民族的經濟前途方才有光明的一日。</p>
<h3>勞資合作與國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>我記得王雲五先生曾經演說過“勞資雙方如水泥與鋼骨，不可分離的，雙方合作，為事業而奮鬬，前途繼有光明的路的。”筆者服務工廠七八年來觀察和體味，覺得王先生的話是金科玉律，一些不錯的。可是近幾天來，國貨工廠，如—華商紗廠—勞方忽因要求增加工資，而接一連二的發生罷工情事，這是何等愚昧的舉動！誠然：物價的騰貴，生活的壓迫—在勞工立塲上說：出賣汗血，所得工資，不足以維持高度的生活，是相當地艱苦的，然而在資方立塲上說，歷年能在不景氣巨浪裏，掙扎過來的，到現在獲得復興機會，稍稍抬頭的，也不過失之東隅，未必能全收桑楡，僅僅是挖肉補瘡而已！所以在事實擺作眼前的洋貨侵略未曾消滅，洋貨心理未曾打倒的時候，勞資更其要步驟一致的團結起來，不容分裂！罷工是自殺的行為，萬萬不可輕易登生的，如果勞方有合理的環境上的要求，不妨一面工作，一面請願，鎮靜而不暴躁，守秩序！守紀律，資方自然解衣推食，有衡情的補救辦法的，生產不間斷，攸關於國貨的光明前途，是非淺鮮的，薛光前先生，在復旦大學演講“意大利”民族的能夠復興！原因是在㊀嚴密的經濟組織，㊁崇高的青年訓練，關於第一點，他說“……譬如紡織一項，”內部可分為地質，選種，棉花，紡紗，織部，染料等。工程師，機器商，跟消費者，都打成一片，……不合標準需要時，他們都可源源本本的去推求和改進……調和勞資一項，在一九二七年也公布了勞動章，規定工人不准罷工，工廠不得關閉，一切糾紛，都由公會調解……頓使國家的經濟組織也鞏固起來……“（見十一月八日新聞報茶話欄）然則勞資合作，直接關乎國貨工廠的本身，間接更關乎國家經濟組織的健全，真是何等重大啊！</p>
<h3>檢討與反省</h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>—我能算中國人嗎？　光陰過去得多快呀！</p>
<p>這上海市民服用國貨年又將和我人告別了！在這市民國貨年行將結束的時候，每一個同胞，對於今年一年來所作的提倡國貨工作，應該檢討一下；反省一下。</p>
<p>現在先說個人的，我們應該思想：我們今年實行提倡國貨服用國貨沒有，我們今年買若干錢的外貨，我們所買的外貨，是不是必需的？是不是沒有國貨可以代替的；如果不是的話，那末我們是不是對得起同胞？對得起國家？然後再由個人而想到家庭；由家庭而想到國家。對於今年的國貨運動，詳細的加以檢討：加以反省。</p>
<p>不錯，今年的市民服用國貨年裏，是有不少是值得欣慰的。像各種國貨的發明：各種國貨的改良；以及愛國同胞的熱心服用國貨等等，都是使我們非常快慰的。可是使我們悲痛的，就是漏巵依然是有幾萬萬，尤其是一切消耗品：娛樂品：化裝品：像什麼魚翅海參；無綫電收音機；香水脂粉：雪花膏：雪花粉：化裝首飾：以及烟酒等項，都有很大的漏　，　　　國貨年　，還有這種現像，實在是我們中華民國國民的恥辱！所以希望同胞們嚴謹的反省一下，記得首都提倡國貨運動會里，曾有　　樣的標語，就是：中國人須用中國貨！不用中國貨不是中國人，　　末，我敢請讀者們大家想一想：我是中國人嗎？諸位同胞！國難日重。外侮日亟，我們在這嚴重的狀態以下，如果再不脚踏實地的去作提倡國貨工作，而仍然祗唱高調的話，則中國的前途，眞可以加上“國亡無日”的那句老話了！我謹在這裏請求大家檢討和反省以後，下一個最大的决心，立時的來提倡國貨。</p>
<h3>訪問家庭和訪問工廠</h3>
<p>— 王樹</p>
<p>本年度，上海市國貨運動聯合會舉辦二件很有意義的工作：一是派女訪問員到各住宅區訪問家庭主歸，並携帶樣品，作實地的宣傳；一是派男訪問員參觀各國貨工廠；實際的調查生產情况。這二者，於溝通產消雙方聲息上是有重大的意義的。</p>
<p>但是，訪問員的工作是否能順利的進行，有待於各方協助者正多。據報載女訪問員的工作情形，知道有少數的主婦不能了解訪問的意義，因而有敷衍，厭惡，拒絕等等的阻礙。然而大體上說，各方面，尤其是報紙的輿論，對於她們都有很多的協助，所以她們的工作，較那些訪問工廠的自是便利不少。至於男訪問員的工作，雖沒見之報載，但據說他們在訪問工廠的時候，所感受到的困難，實還過於她們，要一說他們的癥結所在，就是不能得到廠方的諒解，有時是不能順利的讓他們參觀，而卽便是參觀之後，也祇能得到個浮面的輪廓，所有實際的產銷狀况，經濟情形，廠方都不願明白的指示。這在廠方，當然也有他們的理由，但是他們沒有了解訪問員的使命和少教主婦們一樣，那是無可諱言的。</p>
<p>照說，訪問家庭和工廠在理論上是同樣的重要的，前者可明暸消費者意旨而作改進生產的參攷，後者可知道廠方的生產情形以作推銷技衛的研討，二者是相補並進，不容偏頗的。但是各方面，尤其是負有直接關係的國貨工廠，對於訪問者有很多的誤解，這態度是需要加以糾正的。我們當使訪問員的工作能順利的進行，因為這是溝浦產銷聲息的最實際的方法。</p>
<h3>南洋羣島與國貨市塲</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>這裏所稱的南洋羣島，僅就菲列濱，荷屬東印度，馬來聯邦，婆羅洲，安南，緬甸等處，據最近的調查，華僑的散居在各島上者有六。一五五•○○○人之多，為了華僑之中，多數愛國而願意購買祖國的貨品，所以南洋羣島的確是國貨的大好市塲，就近年來中國對外貿易表上，出口貨品以南洋羣島為大宗，可知那邊自有國貨的廣大市塲，而中國的國貨工廠要求國貨在海外有所發展，那第一步就應注意設法推廣南洋羣島的國貨銷路。</p>
<p>南洋一帶，近年以來，因為土地的肥沃，人口的稠密，所以世各國已都密切的注意着，视为大好的市塲，儘量把货物出口到那边去推销，结果在南洋羣岛的市塲上面，东西各國商品便什麽都可看见，而在營業方面，彼此之間，也就競爭得非常劇烈。卽此已可見南洋羣島在商業上地位是多麼重要，面為我們所不可忽略的。因此，我們希望在當局指導之下，國貨工廠能夠盡力去推廣南洋的國貨市塲。</p>
<p>據說上述各島，每年的進出口統計，全盛時代到達過進口二，五○○，○○○，○○○元，而出口的數字是一，五○○，○○○，○○○元：自從整個世界開始鬧不景氣象而後，南洋方面近年來進出口統計也有自九○○，○○○，○○○元至一，二○○，○○○，○○○元的數字。在這個數字之中，中國方面，近幾年來也佔有不少，尤其是中國出口的國貨，正在逐年的加多起來。由此可知國貨工廠對於南洋方面的國貨市塲，今後如果能夠繼續設法，使其推廣，那前途當然更會有相當的發展。</p>
<p>這是不容諱說的，近年來為了整個世界在　鬧不景氣，所以各國對於舶來的貨物排斥甚力；這原因，中國在歐美各國，除了供給若干原料之外，所有的國貨出品是佔不到什麼地位的。因此，就目前的環境說來，要求國貨在海外有所發展，祇有先向南洋方面找求出路而謀取發展，然後再進而謀取其地各國的市塲。</p>
<p>至於我們應當採用種種方法去推廣南洋的國貨市塲，這裏當然也是一個要研究的問題。在我覺得除了研究南洋方面市塲上的貿易制度，商品實質，以及銀行家方面予以實力的援助，使國貨工廠有力向南洋推銷而外；和南洋的僑商謀取聯絡，時常在海外舉行國貨展覽，致力於各種宣傳，都是極端重要的。特別要望工廠界選擇上好的國貨運到南洋去，如果貪圖厚利而把劣等貨品混銷至南洋，那麼結果會失去僑胞的信心，甚至可失去南洋整個的國貨市塲，原是不可忽略的一點！</p>
<h3>第一流國貨</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>昔有第一流內閣，今有第一流國貨，第一流、云者，實至名歸，最著名最有價值最足以採用，而在一般國貨中堪居領袖地位之謂也。同一國貨，同一出品，而得第一流之美名者，非易事也，必焉經無數之精神，用無數之力量，經無數次之研究，歷無數次之改良，此中需要學識技衛，與一改進工夫者，不知多少，繼能享此美名，非倖致，更非假借。必焉名實相符，得人信仰，然後居之無媿，用之無慚。茍工業界欲以第一流自待者，人人以此策勉，以此奮發，異日凡屬國貨，均可以第一流加之，此時國貨工業之進展，豈今日能想像及之耶？事在人為，願共勉之。</p>

<h3>戰争</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>戰爭是殘酷的，悲慘的。</p>
<p>戰爭要破壞了人類的文明，毀滅了社會上一切的物質建設，使熱鬧的都市，變成廢墟，使偉大的建築物，化為灰燼，更使成千成萬的男女老少，喪失了生命。</p>
<p>然而，當前的世界，却正整個地陷在戰爭，火併的醖釀中，濃重的火藥氣，已經充滿了全地球。</p>
<p>有許多的野心家，是已在舒展牠的威力，公開或半公開地宰割我們弱者，可是，在他們的嘴裏，却正高唱着“征服野蠻‘傳播文明’和宣揚王道”的調子。</p>
<p>所以，我們千萬不要忘掉，只有為祖國的生存而戰爭，這纔是人類最偉大最光榮的戰爭，也只有這個戰爭，纔可以使人類重新建築起“和平的殿堂”。</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>我的屋子只有門，沒有窗，因為怕孩子闖進來吵，便連門也關着。問到空氣和光綫，不言可知。無論畫夜，總得開電燈，我的工作和生活，都在刺眼的電燈光下解决的。休息的時候在傍晚，街上踱踱，見見天日，雖然精神覺得輕鬆些，呈現轉動在眼前的，却仍是一幅幅生活的圖畫。往往仍使我帶着鬰黯的心回來，一天傍晚我照例踱出去，在那家國藥號門口圍着許多人，孩子尤其上勁，驀地裏從人羣中飛出一隻鳥來，剛飛上屋脊，一個旋兒又飛進人羣，因為從黑暗走到光亮的地方，眼睛有些花，瞧不清那鳥飛上飛下鬧着什麼玩意兒？便有意無意的擠上去，這才看明白了。</p>
<p>人羣中站着個戴瓜皮帽的中年男子，面孔瘦削面黝暗無澤，大約不很得意吧，手掌裏托着的正是那雙飛鳥。右手揑兩粒骨質彈丸，對鳥不時揚着手勢來了，他把一粒彈丸向空一丟，鳥亦顿时飞撲而土，他接着又丟上第二粒彈丸，那鳥先後把兩粒彈丸啣住，重飛到中年男子手上吐了出來，於是他打衣袋裏掏出幾粒殼，它俯首啄食。大家都看得出神，讚嘆着鳥的靈敏。</p>
<p>我却沒有讚嘆的意思，這正是一種生活的縮影，那烏拚着翅力飛上飛下，受人的驅使，所為者，幾粒榖食而已。這樣的把戲玩了四五次，那中年男子望了衆人一眼，說道：“那個歡喜這隻鳥，可以便宜出讓，我呌弄尷尬，不然，自己練熟了的，再也不肯讓給別人的，誰要，兩隻洋。”他托着那雙鳥送到人眼前。</p>
<p>這又有一重生活在裏面，他的話，聲明他不是在這裏玩把戲給人看的，不是公子哥兒的好整以暇，把自己的玩物誇耀於人前。他希圖獲得“兩隻洋”以填補其“尷尬”。然而，衆人給他的，是失望，失望。我自己吧，縱使有兩隻洋，我的屋子，又豈是養鳥玩鳥的地方呢？唉生活！</p>
<h3>摩興</h3>
<p>— 眞相</p>
<p>寒冷的朔風吹起以後，有外套的女人們，早披起冬季的外套，裹着或適應冬令的一種姿態。其中有一種反穿黑羔裘式大衣所表現出的姿態；對於我的印象，似乎更深。</p>
<p>我不是反對女人們穿黑羔裘的大衣；我却是每回看見那身材窈窕的女人，裏在那件黑色羔裘大衣裏，就不禁要想到“摩興”！</p>
<p>“摩興”是德人摩洛克的一條愛犬。他和－般外國的狼種獵犬完全不同，身材比我國獅子狗稍高大些。而全身的皮毛，簡直是黑綿羊一般。許多人看了以後，總會聯想到是和那着黑羔裘的女郎有同一的神氣。因為摩典不僅全身的皮毛是令人覺着怪可愛的；并且有一種柔順溫和的神氣，與一般帶有英挺姿態的外國獵犬，顯有特殊的差異。我們都以為這是難能可貴之點。</p>
<p>摩興的主人，去年特地化費好幾千元將他由柏林運到南京來，平時朝夕共處，形影相隨。當夏天氣候大暖，摩與那一身毛是不很適宜於炎日薰蒸的，主人為愛惜他起見，特常請專門理髪師，為其剪除長毛。每次修剪的代價，是三元五角。</p>
<p>摩興蹲在地上，可算像一個兩歲的小孩子。他沒有尾巴，而頭上披着蓬鬆的鬈毛，尤加美觀。我每次看到摩興，總要想起一個·穿着黑色羔裘大衣的女人；同時，我每次看到一個身材俊小的女人裏起一襲黑羔裘外套以後，也永遠不會將“摩興”忘了！</p>
<h3>鴿的秘密</h3>
<p>— 李大白</p>
<p>鴿何以會從很遠的距離飛回家裏來？這是一個極普通的問題，是一個極簡單的問題。對於這一個問題，誰都能夠解答。</p>
<p>一般的解答，都是這樣說：</p>
<p>因為鴿的眼睛特別銳利，認識力和記憶力極強，所以養熟之後，無論把它放到怎樣遠的地方去，它總是能夠飛回來的。</p>
<p>這種解說是最普通的，是最為多數人所承認的。初看起來，覺得是很對，是很有道理。因此，凡是購買鴿子的人，必先揀選鴿子的眼睛。眼睛好的便是好鴿，眼睛壞的便是壤鴿。養鴿的人，亦以眼睛之好壞來分別鴿之貴賤。眼睛最好的，他們便最寶貴它。</p>
<p>其實，這不過是一半的理由。眼睛的好壞，固然可以决定鴿的好壞。但是，這僅足以根據來斷定鴿的記憶力和認識力之強弱吧了。</p>
<p>假定把上海養的鴿帶到南京去放，在那樣遠的距離，它耶樣小的眼睛，無論如何，是看不到上海的景物的。無論它對於養育的地方認識得怎樣清楚，記憶得怎樣堅牢，在幾百里路遠的地方，它也無法去認識的。所以有人以為鴿必定是有別的本領，才會從那麼遠的地方飛回家來。</p>
<p>這是鴿的一種秘密，誰都不能知道。</p>
<p>關於鴿的秘密，許多科學家都覺得很有興趣，都極力潛心研究。但是，許多年以來，都沒有研究出來。</p>
<p>現在，有的科學家發見鴿的身體上能夠發生一種無綫電的作用。他們相信鴿的耳朶上的半圓形的淺溝，和無綫電收音器一樣，能夠收取相當距離內的無綫電。根據這種無綫電的作用，鴿始能從那看不見的很遠的地方飛回家來。</p>
<p>並且有些科學家正在研究鴿的無綫電。</p>
<h3>蘇州的茶博士</h3>
<p>— 德鄰</p>
<p>茶肆旣然是個消閒良地，各種典型的人物，都趨之若鶩，化上十幾枚的銅元，於是沁人心脾的一壺香茗，便可以儘量地暢飲，並且更有在喝茶之外，手裏抱了水烟袋，燃了紙捲，抽着烟，這更可以增進他們的談鋒，某家點心長，某家點心短，某家酒味好，某家酒味壞，某家姑娘俏，某家姑娘美，對於國事，有時也在那裏高談闊論，可是都不着邊際的。</p>
<p>但是，茶博士更有操着副業的，就是提了籠子養鳥，每天早晨午後，提了籠子裏的鳥，到他們的博士茶會去，眞是閒情逸致。在寂寞蕭條的僻街陋巷，伴了他啾唧喧嘈，解除了他在路上的無聊。</p>
<p>沒了，寄語博士，你們可知道現在中國備受着異族的威脅，塞外充滿了槍砲聲，和火藥味，前綫的將士，把他的血和肉，奮不顧身地在和敵人抗戰，所以絕對不容你們再醉生夢死地寄生下去了，要曉得：你們是人，人生是負有使命的，你們不要忘記自己的使命。（完）</p>

<p>第十回（黃花對憔悴秋心添愁素帕寄纏綿奇文鑄錯）</p>
<p>於是聯想到上次他所留下的那張字，這或者他又有什麼用意了。在這樣揣想之下，同時也就看到了正中抽屜裏露出來的那隻花綢手絹角。等劉媽走了，這就去把抽屜打開，只看那白綢絹子，上面花着紅藍相間的花格子，這就猜出是女子的用物，那很濃厚的香氣，是不印說了。接看手絹下那張字條，是很顯明的看到。捧起來讀了兩遍，始而是不解所謂。後來仔細想着，分明是自己寫的那張字，讓他看到了。同時有什麽相干，他何必這樣情意纏綿的還留下一條手絹呢？那字條上的字，大約還記得。那最後一句是表明自己態度之處，自己曾說着同我所欽佩的人，並不曾說過一句話，他也不想想，那絕對於他無關嗎？他自己誤會了，那還不能怪人。若是讓別人知道了，未免要生是非。尤其是江夢蘭聽不得這消息，彼此友誼，那要完全斷送了。但是這個誤會，又不便向友梅解釋的。和他說着，他不很是難為情嗎？現在正盼望他從中帮助着，以便和夢蘭通消息，把他也加入了這愛情之網裏，這消息無法讓他再知道了。不然，事情越紛亂了。國器得了這样一張字條，一條手絹，倒反是增加了不少的煩惱。而且自己又缺乏對女性說話的勇氣，假使他一天天的誤會跟着深了下去，到了將來，他也是照夢蘭這樣書信不斷，如何處置？而且他還能動自己家裏來的。難道見了他的面，逕直的對他說，並不愛他嗎？無論自己不忍出口，也就不好意思出口，更有一層，他有了這誤會，也許來得更密，恐怕自己的母親，也要認為事情可疑了。當天想了大半天的心事，想不出一個辦法來。到了次日，一會兒想出門去躲開他，一會兒又想躲開不得，躲開了對他所誤會的，無法解釋了。一兒兒又想，留封信在抽屜裏，讓他自己去看吧？一會兒又想，他看過了信之後，以為是翻來覆去，戲弄他，他要生氣呢？還是像作日一般，不能解决這個問題。可是這日完全過去，友梅也不曾來，最後國器預備了許多要和他說的話，總算白費了氣力。（一二五）</p>

<h3>東京寶塚舞影</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在歐戰之前，到中國菜館裏吃一碗麵都吝嗇的日本人，近來大變了，戲院銀幕，已做了幾年的好生意。以東京寶塚而論，已足以表示日本人都發了洋財，遠非昔比了。</p>
<p>寶塚歌舞團的大本營，原來是在大阪近郊。自從在東京分設了歌舞劇塲之後，營業鼎盛，至今不衰。戲劇節目，每月更換一次，可以始終滿座。正中較好的座位，必須當日留票，於是下午六時開塲的戲劇，在朝晨八九時便站成了長蛇陣。較前的座位，非前五六日購買不可。在開演和下塲的時候，門外又站滿觀衆，那是想看演員眞面目的熱心家。寶塚是歌舞學校公開表演的性質，學生全係女子，論理寶塚熱者當是男子，那知適得其反。日本摩登少女之歐化者，名為寶塚派“寶塚黨”，都是熱戀着寶塚的明星。據說為了蓋原邦子而死的女子，已不知多少了。在寶塚坐席上，至少三分之二是女子，最令人注目的是一羣穿着制服的女學生。</p>
<p>除了星期和節目，每日只演一塲，是寶塚創辦人以“娛樂不妨正事”為號召的。價格自半元至兩元，極合中流社會的胃口。於是中學生積蓄了星期的零用，也可娛樂一次了。寶塚的房屋只有四層，最高層是食堂商店，內中附有一間圖書館，和一座小孩子的小戲院，是用畫片和擴音機配成的。母齣歌舞劇終了之後，便有三十分鐘之休息。觀衆便隨意出外休息購買什物，或吸烟飲茶。把枯坐聽搭布景的弊病補救了。但是休息地方必須廣大，始可容納。每層大都有展覽會，以吸引觀衆，乘便又作為廣告。</p>
<p>表演日本舊式戲劇，亦加以改良，成為歌舞劇。但說白做工仍不脫舊式戲劇面目。新式歌舞，完全受歐美歌舞電影之影響，，完全歐化。所用的日本話中，尚時雜以英語，其他無論矣。編劇取材，亦以外國名著為本，於是連劇中人姓名亦用西文。建築雖並不十分華美，但歌聲甚清晰。衣服裝飾電光布景，均臻上乘。演員人數又多，伴舞伴唱常多至五六十人，在東亞稱獨步。然對於歌舞本身，仍未見有改進或創造，這是過鈴迎合觀衆心理的結果。</p>
<p>三層樓上的觀衆，可以租用一架望遠鏡，便利近視者不少。不幸而歸途遇雨，也可以租傘回家，其設計周到於此可見－斑。日人常輕視美國人民喜歌舞酒色，竟忘却了自己也已踏進享樂之路了。</p>

<h3>陝亂不難和平解决</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>西安之變，自經蔣委員長脫險，安然返京後，一般人的猜測，以為善後問題，必能迎刃而解，再沒有別的問題發生，不料張漢卿雖隨將委員長來京，而楊子又逞兵抗命，負隅自固，迄今旬餘，形勢嚴重，尚無和平解决之望，此實非我人意料所能及者。</p>
<p>然以我料之，此事不難順利解决，其故有二，㊀陝西方面，假定形勢嚴重，有絕對的野心，則蔣委員長之出險，必定比較困難，現在蔣委員長已安然抵京，回奉休養，而于楊復違抗中央命令，搗弄潢池，此種行為，已覺前後異趣，故我料其必易解决者一也。㊁現在我國的局勢，是怎樣的一個局勢？百靈廟雖經克服，而綏邊的形勢，還十分嚴重，于楊身為軍人，必能明瞭衛國責任，今于楊非但不去抗敵，而還欲搗亂後方，非特自己良心上所不許，抑亦國人所無從寬假者也。</p>
<p>故現在于楊崛強於西北，其欲要求之目的為何？雖尚不可得知，故惟望中央以寬大為懷，曉以大義，明以利害，使若輩頭腦簡單之軍人，幡然感悟，貼然服從，則我國實力非但絕不損失，而更得使之効命疆塲，贖其前愆，是我國一般人民所聲香禱祝者也。</p>
<p>萬一中央曉以大義，明以禍福，而被等竟怙惡不悛，抗命到底，此種跋扈不可教訓之軍人，旣為國人所共棄，則國軍所指，自易勦除，計日可待，故我更望此事，及早解决，萬一遷延時日，此種軍隊，鋌而走險，為共黨所利用，為異族所勾結，卽欲剷除，亦較費力。</p>
<h3>碼頭上</h3>
<p>— 平君</p>
<p>××班小火輪開走後，碼頭上冷寂起來了。</p>
<p>小火輪駛在河心，吃力地拖曳着兩艘民船，挺着它底狹窄的胸脯，把嫩艷的河面劃開。於是，平靜的河水便給激起兩道微波，一揚一揚地傳開去，最後，它就把軟弱而且懊惱的浪花朝着堤岸猛撞，但堤岸底冷面孔使它失敗了。一次，一次，都是泛着流淚似的白沫而退走的。</p>
<p>……漸漸地，連那渡輪底糢糊的影子也消逝了。</p>
<p>我正出神地想着每個被侵害者都應用一種有力的強固的抵抗，而給於他底對方以挫擊的恥辱……</p>
<p>烟剷（老槍）林甫光跨着母鴨一般蠢拙的步伐，從大路口拐過來。</p>
<p>“你這契弟仔是在想投河麼？”他露出一口烟屎牙，一顆顆給毒物蝕壞不的牙尚，當縫問還滿嵌祈那攤物底污黑痕跡。</p>
<p>我一邊打惡心，一邊把腦袋扭過來對着河水，說：</p>
<p>“死并不是能逃避的事實。慢性的自殺比較急性的不見得是高明的。而且，把寶貴的生命輕放在無價值的浪費上面，似乎‘人底意義’决不如此簡單吧。”</p>
<p>他底豬肝色的臉頰紅起來了•——紫中泛紅，又是別有一番風情。可是，我以為他底臉紅决不是因為害恥，懂得害恥的人，他底精神是不會向下的。</p>
<p>“遇到你這個‘頂頸出’就滯運（悔氣）啦，兄弟，老寶對你說，你這樣是很危險的，……唔，很危險……很容易冒犯朋友吧！一個人會寂寞地了却他底一生的。”说的时候，他底情绪很急燥，時常說着重覆的字眼，有點口吃似的了。“你覺得寂寞可怕麼？”</p>
<p>“你底話是什麼意思？”我對於林烟剷底問話感到奇怪了。</p>
<p>“我說這里怕祗有我們兩個廣東人吧。”他聳着瘦削的肩頭，親暱地笑着說。</p>
<p>“難道本地佬會喫人嗎？——喫人也要揀有肉的呀。”</p>
<p>“丟你個‘電燈胆’（不識相的傢伙）……”他又把黑牙齒露了出來。</p>
<p>於是，我勝利地笑起來了。</p>
<p>河水現在是緩緩地流着，似乎牠已經感覺到一切奮不顧身的鬥爭都是多餘而又徒然的事情一般。幽靜地它發出輕而微的，好像太息一樣的低唱。</p>
<p>古老的城墻懶懶然的舒伸着它底懷抱，在那里面矗立起一座在歷史上曾經有過光榮日子的寶塔。嚮晚的大太陽底紅光正凝視着塔底頂尖。……</p>
<p>古城底一切的囂擾現在是沈寂了。</p>
<p>我把靠着碼頭上底欄杆的身體向下俯了一點，我想，或者這樣可以聽到河水底憂怨的太息的。</p>
<p>但，林甫光把他底瘦得祗剩骨頭的手掌撼着我底背部。而後繼慢慢地說：</p>
<p>“你瞧，那東西多夠自由，快樂呀，一點無掛慮地在飛翔，……”</p>
<p>這時，一隻潑刺的穩健的蒼鷹正繞</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>着塔頂打旋轉。古塔在鷹底強調的傲視之吓，頽然地垂下腦袋。而且，還襯着那城牆底龐大面暗茫的陰影，一種遲幕的傷感，很容易地從人們底心緒里邊漫升起來了。</p>
<p>碼頭上，趕末班輪船的客人漸漸地又聚着了幾個。有三個散兵之流的人倚着欄目高聲地閒談着。那身材短小的，眼睛里橫溢着一種兇狠的光芒的一個，吐了一口痰在河上，說：</p>
<p>“××鎭眞是個好所在呢。”</p>
<p>“………三年了，唔………我離開那地方足足有……”那臉孔好像鸚鵡一樣的兵士夢囈一般地回答。</p>
<p>突然，一個美貌的風流的臉影在人叢間出現了。</p>
<p>林煙剷底眼光追逐似地掃了過去。</p>
<p>“那傢伙不是好路道，在這里碼頭上我看見得太多了。一次是還未上船的時候，和一個老頭子在喁喁的耳語，前回我到××鎮，又見她和一個上船時還不認識的漢子，起先攀談起來，上岸時就拍拖（挽臂同行的意思)而去了。”</p>
<p>“老舉（婊子）麼？”林烟剷反問着我。接着：“丢那媽，下江佬生無結髮妻，死無葬身地——”</p>
<p>“××鎮底女人有好些是有着娼妓底行為的。”我說。</p>
<p>“在一個健全的社會制度之下，娼妓底存在，纔能算是可恥的事情呢！”</p>
<p>林甫光略略地抬了一下腦袋，用沈鬱的聲調說着。</p>
<p>我又把眼光轉向那繞着塔頂打迴旋的蒼鷹。遼闊而廣漠的暗藍色的天空，襯了一個活潑，自由，快樂的黑影，是怎麼的使我神往地戀慕着啊。於是，我太息起來了。</p>
<h3>後樓紀事</h3>
<p>— 聶筠</p>
<p>後樓那家人家的兒子生了十多天病死了。那丈夫是個散工木匠，他每天到工頭家里去問生意，要等工頭接着了“包作”或者別的工頭那里缺少人手，他才有一天工好做最近工頭剛接手一宗建造家祠的“包作”據說那是一個富紳的後裔，為他的祖宗建造一所十分宏大富麗的祠廟，－切建築都是由專家精工設計的，預計要六個月後完成。這宗生意比建造住宅要多好處，因為住宅是活人住的，要表面美麗之外，還要估量到堅固耐久。造宗祠是並不如此，內容不妨隨意增减，祇要外表壯觀而已。那些子孫們本來的意思就是如此，如果因了那新建的宗祠為地方上多－個足供觀賞之景，也於願足矣！工頭果然可以在這一宗生意上坐吃幾年，那些散工似乎見實惠，要六個月不必顧慮到明天有不有工做，他們最怕的是每天到工頭那里去空跑一躺。</p>
<p>後樓的散工木匠剛在一個月之前生了個兒子他已經有五個女兒了，兒子却是第一個。平常在沒有工做的時候，那木匠常常喝醉了酒罵人，他不是抱怨沒有工做，却罵他的妻子是個“白虎精”，說她一進門就什麼事都不順手，而左一個右一個養了那些“賠錢貨。”那女人似乎也受慣了這一套，她總是趕着做事，不搭口的，或者她簡直沒有聽進去；因為住在前樓的我們，祇要工匠喝醉了酒，我們就知道他要說些什麼話出來了。</p>
<p>養了兒子後却有了一陣安靜，卽是沒有工做，他也抱抱孩子，頗像一個做爸爸的。我的妻子曾感概地對我說：在中國要打開重男輕女的習慣，不知要到什麼時候？有錢人不必說，他們恐怕那多末的造孽錢死後落了空。就像那個窮得沒有工做就要罵妻子白虎精的木匠，也把兒子看得那樣貴重，生了見子好像就有飯吃似的！</p>
<p>我的妻子的感慨却應了騐，在生兒子的一個月後，那工匠就有六個月的工好做。現在他又喝酒了，自然每次又是喝醉的，可是他却稱道他妻子肚皮的爭氣了：“時來運來，養個兒子帶進元寶來！”一個兒子眞的主宰了他們家庭的悲歡，雖然妻子還是不搭口；她現在又多了個孩子的事要做。</p>
<p>然而好景不常，這情形祇維持了一個多月。那個寶貝兒子生了病，看來很兇險，整天的哭鬧，也請過醫生，醫生不知說什來着的，有四五天後樓幾乎像招了火災似的，大哭小喊，連隔壁人家也偷偷地到後門口來探問了。那木匠大概是愛子心切吧，或者他竟是在籌划錢來為兒子醫病，有好好的工做也不想去了，那條粗嗓子獃在後樓彷彿是個戲台上的小丑，被妻子罵幾句也會閉上鳥嘴不發氣的。</p>
<p>那兒子終於生十多天病死了。死的時候天還沒有亮，我聽清楚後樓燒了幾件小衣服，夫妻倆個反默默地不作聲了，那個最大的“賠錢貨”在哭她的弟弟，却哭得很傷心。</p>
<p>到中午上，那木匠邀了個朋友把小棺材抬出去了。我剛在弄口遇到他，他像平時一樣，彷彿死了的不是他的兒子，健步如飛的走了。</p>
<p>後樓又寂靜了，他們都在回憶着那一塲惡夢吧！第二天丈夫上工去了，但是那眞是個不幸的消息，他的工已經有另外的一個本匠代替他的位子了，工頭的理由也是很充足的，他們訂了合同限期交貨，你不來做就由他來做了。</p>
<p>自然“白虎精”又發作了，也聽見摔去了一個玻璃東西的聲音，這一回妻子却搭口了：“命里窮總是窮的，白虎精也替你生了個兒子，你招得住嗎，窮鬼，眞是死不完的討債鬼！”</p>
<p>一個“賠錢貨”突然啞的一聲哭了出來，大概是那女人抓她來出氣的。</p>

<h3>彈詞</h3>
<p>曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」</p>
<p>中西「一○四○」下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「長生殿聞鈴」</p>
<p>峨嵋山下少人經。苦雨凄風撲面迎。風流天子情難盡。龍淚紛紛泣玉人。昨日馬嵬情太慘。六軍忽地變軍心。早難道，三星難照賢妃子。刧數該遭楊太真。而今追憶長生殿。人影衣香七夕盟。願生同羅帳死同陵。而今香魂艷魄歸何處。翠鳳青鸞兩地分。教就梨園歌一曲。霓裳從此絶知音。沉香亭有誰與我奏淸平。陳元禮，很無情，陽奉陰違違朕身。以致於祿山兵變范陽城。從今一别難相見。要見賢妃。只好見白綾。力士開箱與我取白綾。見綾如見賢妃面。妃子吓，並不是，江山情重美人輕。高力士，啟聖君，楊娘娘已死豈能生。請加鞭追趕羊腸道。劍閣聞鈴幾斷魂。杜鳴風雨夜三更。</p>
<p>蔣賓初「三笑」</p>
<p>新聲（一三八○）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「昭君」</p>
<p>傾國傾城千古談。王艢姿態妙非凡。三千粉黛無顔色。月亦留情花亦慚。不料單于聞絶色。和親天子賜和番。雖然糧足兵精鋭。文武朝臣拒敵難。後宫幾許良家子。我獨承恩出漢關。君皇親自呼宫主。斷送終身嫁異蠻。去路迢遥歸程遠。别時容易見時難。臨行拜别照陽院。雙手扶持雙淚澘。天子離亭親餞酒。酒杯和淚不能乾。漢家仗我安邦國。大小官員跪兩班。乘駿馬，颭旗旛，內家裝束跨雕鞍。此後終無相見日。今生未必望生還。歷盡千山與萬山。</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>蘇聯紀錄影片「阿比西尼亞」</h3>
<p>在阿比西尼亞所進行的，奪取殖民地的戰爭，是在「宣揚文明」的名義之下進行的，但是飛機大砲的殘酷的教訓，對於被侵略者是永不會忘記的。</p>
<p>而「阿比西尼亞」這部影片，更是一個很好的備忘錄。</p>
<p>這部影片是蘇聯電影新聞工廠特派員隨着阿國軍隊在前綫拍攝的。它允分的説明了什麽叫做法西斯蒂的「宣揚文明」，揭露了侵略者的本來面目，紀錄下征服殖民地土人的殘暴。並且在正確的觀點下，再三的在影片中表明被侵略者是怎樣的儘可能用了自己所有的力量去抵抗敵人，不屈服，不畏難，爲着自己祖國的獨立而戰爭。</p>
<p>這部蘇聯的紀錄影片，即將在上海大戲院公映。</p>
<p>孫瑜新作「春到人間」</p>

<h3>「業餘劇人」之訪問</h3>
<p>本月二十四起在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>幾乎每天都是通宵，他們和她們一點也不疲倦，也不想休息，整個屋子將爲他們的熱狂的精神撕毁了，燃燒了。</p>
<p>樓上樓下都在進行他們的總排練，沈西苓像一個軍事教官一樣地肅立着，眼睛出神地望着每一個演員，嚴厲地喊着：「All　ready」空氣是那麽緊張。李林開始感傷了，聲音好像要哭出來。「不够，感情不够，聲音起碼要五十排坐位外都聽得見！」沈西苓這樣喊出來了，趙丹在旁邊説：「Z。G。」</p>
<p>於是又再來一個。</p>
<p>這裏是君里和藍蘋，吕班和葉露茜，他們是倆對苦與樂的情人，藍蘋一看見君里就幾乎要哭出來。吕班呢，他挾着一支吉太，是哥薩克的裝束，漫聲地唱着俄國味的歌曲，他的愛人葉露茜來了，他立刻擁抱着她，「哈，哈！」吕班又蹤聲地笑了，顯出得意的樣子。</p>
<p>導演者章泯一聲也不響地坐在旁邊，冷静地觀察着每個人的動作和姿態。</p>
<p>那是另外一間屋子，有着一羣年青人，他們在計劃紀念特刋的編輯，洗印照片，畫招貼，忙得没有一刻鐘能够停手。</p>
<p>唐納，伊明又忙着把紙去分給各人簽名和寫一句這次公演的紀念留言，因爲要登在紀念特刋上。</p>
<p>袁牧之：戲劇是我的娘家，電影是我的夫家，出嫁兩年，没有回門，此次忙中抽暇，不能多事逗留，且待着春天吧。（大意）</p>

<h3>一九三七年式新司蒂倍克車到申</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>一九三七年式新司蒂倍克汽車。茲已運抵海上。木埠亞爾倍路一號司蒂倍克經售商垣通汽車公司。刻正從事開箱。日內卽將陳列於樣子問。以供衆覽。新車在基本方面。較諸一九三六式。雖無若何差別。但在美觀安全經濟及效用等方面。則新車所具有之種種新發明與特色。寶已登峯造極。確駕歷來出品而上云。新車共分兩組。卽總統組與執政組是也。總統組之機械工程上的偉大進步。不一而足。而其中尤以自動選定之特擋排。為最足稱。蓋凡在時速卅五英里以上之任何速度時、均可隨意運用之也。</p>
<p>特式後輪軸。為司蒂倍克總統組與執政組新車之又一顯著特色。其齒輪設計。介於斜旋傘形齒輪及蝸輪之間。為效用最宏之唯一齒輪組合新車因係裝配此種後輪。故車廂後部底板。儘可較低。而其路面距隙。並不致因此有所犧性。新車近車門口底板。較低三又十六分之一寸。故車門高度大增。而全車高度。則無所增益。新車內部所以寬宏舒暢。彌便進出。此種後軸之裝用。蓋亦其原因之一也。</p>
<p>新式雙落車架。為一九三七式新司蒂倍克之又一進步。其堅強鞏固程度。視一九三六式殆尤過之。又新車上之新式吸震器。乃與底盤構成一體。而非如尋常之僅係一種外加附屬品者。所可相提並論。新吸震器旣非釘於車架。而與輪軸復不相連接。蓋所謂直接動作式也。至其構造極為緊凑。而自動溫度管轄器等。並皆包括在內。</p>
<p>按如以駕駛管理而言。新司蒂倍克之得心應手。操縱便利。洵非舊有式樣所可冀及。推原其故。蓋以新車裝配最新雙桿式轉向輪也。此種復比式轉向輪。設計絕佳。構製彌簡。旣使停車轉向均更便捷。對於車行速度。且更能隨意節制。以充分享受駕駛之樂。至其機械力量。與抵抗路面巓震力量。均已大為增加。而其壽命亦且因無須勤加檢騐而愈臻悠久。</p>
<p>司蒂倍克總統組新車上裝配之發電機。因附有自動電流及電壓調整器。故不論車行速率若何。蓄電池均可充電足量。而於任何駕駛情形下。復决無過量之虞。新車不論總統組抑執政組。概裝佛勒姆機油與馬達澄清器。故除換季時例須更換外。機油蓋無更換之必要。善名之司蒂倍克阻風。茲已格外進步。且更簡單化。故欲實施應時檢驗。較前尤為便利。新阻風計有三種校準方法。可因馬達燃料所含四炭嶠質之不同。而施以相當調整運用。按此項調整方法。不僅為任何修理員所擅長。卽任何駕駛人。亦不難於三五分鐘內。立卽明瞭而優為之焉。</p>
<p>一九三七式司蒂倍克執政組新車。以裝有橡皮絕緣自由節。故其驅動自如。而動作部份。復不致於損蝕。且並無潤滑之必要。司蒂倍克新車。於高速時。所以極平穩安靜之至。此種裝置。蓋自有其極大關係也。又新車上一律裝配特種始動克拉子。故雖隆冬天氣。亦極便於開動。蓋以一經搖轉。卽能自然繼續。直至引擎駛動而後已也。</p>
<p>新車底盤方面之又一變更。厥為停放塞車桿之位置。恰為轉向輪左側表板之下方。駕駛人直接運用。彌感便利。至於前廂底板之上。且因此而雜物悉除。地位彌見寬宏。於是由左門進出。遂極便利之至。再司蒂倍克兩組新車上。一律裝有新式諧動器。故調排毫不費力。非常靈便。他如自動山抓。為司蒂倍克去年所首創之一種安全特色。今則一九二七式新車上。仍皆裝用之。新車引擎因主要軸承。與引擎橡皮托架。以及拐軸均衡等。均經改革。彌見精良，故其平穩安靜。尤為歷來所不逮。（未完）</p>
<p>▲殘餘零件所配成的汽車美國甘薩斯州惠奇太地方有一個名呌朋。潑萊斯東者。他利用汽車肇禍案中損壞汽車二十五輛的殘餘零件。裝配成左圖的一輛汽車。這二十五輛毀損的汽車。曾犧牲三十七人的生命。這輛東拼西凑而成的車子。有數種零件來自匪黨所用的汽車。在警士追緝時所毀損的。</p>

<h3>海外汽車新訊</h3>
<p>— 愚</p>
<p>▲英國汽車改裝風屏　英國運輸部規定自一月一日起。所有汽車上之屏或前窗玻璃。應一律改用安全玻璃。以期减少危險。此項規定對於兩層汽車之上層前窗玻璃。不在限內。運輸部對於安全玻璃使用之規定，車凡造新者。自一九三二年一月一日起風屏及前車窗均須裝安全玻璃。但各車之已在使川中者。則強迫限期至一九三七年一月一日起改用。據汽車製造商會之估計。目下使用中之汽車未裝安全玻璃者。約為私用汽車三○○•○○○輛。運貨汽車二○○、○○○輛。故此項規定於明正實行後。將有五○○•○○○車主感受影響。但聞此項玻璃之裝配手續頗快。祇須數小時卽可。其他價約為英金二鎊至三鎊云。</p>
<p>▲納菲爾捐資建教堂　歷年來英國馬律斯車廠之增鉅。工人所居之考萊村。人口續漸增多。在初當馬律斯廠•新設時。其人口不過二百餘而已。及至今日乃一躍而為二五•○○○人。該地原有教堂一所。當居民稀少時尚可應用。今則因聽道者衆。一至星期日卽不能相容。後至者乃多向隅。馬律斯主人納菲爾動爵乃斥資三五•○○○鎊。另建二規模宏大之教堂云。</p>
<p>▲運貨汽車產額估計　據克雷斯勒汽車。公司通琪組運貨汽車及商用汽車銷售主任白克氏之估計。美國今年產銷之運貨汽車其總數將達八三○•○○○輛。一九三六年計已增進百分之二十矣。百氏又謂。一九三五年最後之三個月產額旣為一八○•○○○輛如以此數伸加百分之二十。則本年同季之產額可達二一六•○○○輛。再以此數加於已經估計之六一八•○○○輛。本年一年間之運貨汽車量大約可達八三四。○○○輛。所謂八十三萬輛者。豈非綽乎有餘乎。</p>
<p>▲赫特森之奇妙展覽　此次在紐約舉行之汽車展覽會中。赫特森與透拉平有兩種奇妙展覽。極為參觀者所稱道。其名為“室內駕駛”與“自己講話之汽車”。第一項在室內張一巨大玻璃之電影銀幕。參觀者坐於此幕之前。卽見有馬路之景緻反射於幕上。乃不啻駛車於郊外。此時“駕駛者”可運用“電影”隨路景之不同而變換排擋。</p>
<p>第二項“自動說話之汽車”。當參觀者步入此車時。卽聞有說話聲不知從車中何方面來。但其語調則係正對自己而發者。且有時能呼客之名姓。繼卽詳釋新車之特點。甚為詳盡。客聆之亦不覺其嘮叨也。</p>
<p>▲各廠日夜趕造新車　紐約車展閉幕後。各廠卽將趕交定貨•故在十一月中旬左右各車廠卽日夜動工。以便臨時得以應市。別克之出品因零售市塲亟需。已屆最高之生產能率。十二月份該廠產額已定為二八•○○○輛。十二月六日為星期五。其總產量為一千三百三十三輛。其中一千零六十一輛為國內定貨。此外未造成之定貨尚有五六•一二三輛之多。又據別克總理寇的士稱。一九三七年之別克產量預計為二四七•○○○輛。雪佛蘭新因市塲需要甚殷。車亦動工。在十一月中句時每日已產車五加倍•○○○輛。但因不敷支配。更進而為每日六•○○○輛。納許新車自在紐約車展等處展覽兩日後。已獲得定貨二四•○○○輛。其後月有源源續增之勢。該廠為適環境起見亦正大事應趕造云。</p>
<p>▲雪佛蘭車又獲首選　按照美國汽車製造商聯會之規定。每次舉行車展時。凡會員廠之出品銷售上之價值最鉅者。得有第一選擇會塲之優先權。本屆紐約車展中此權又為雪佛蘭所得。因本年型車雪佛蘭已銷去一•一二五•○○○輛之多。乃得仍獲首選。雪佛蘭於已往往十年中。至此已為第七次之常年銷車最鉅者。</p>

<h3>Yang's Troops Attack National Army</h3>
<p>A Skirmish Has Already Occurred / Most Foreigners in Xi'an Have Escaped / Various Parties Urgently Request an Order for Suppression</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Yang Hucheng is actively preparing for war. His garrison brigade has launched an attack on the Central Army from Shang County. Liu Duoquan's troops in Chishui have also engaged in military action, and a skirmish has already occurred. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>◎ Tongguan The forward posts of Zhang's 104th to 1096th Divisions are intermingled with bandits and are heavily guarded. Only peddlers are allowed to pass. It is reported that Weinan has been looted, Xi'an is empty and only one division is stationed there. Sun Wei-ru intends to take up his new post, but is blocked by northern bandits. Over eighty foreigners have recently evacuated. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Today, it is learned that the Shaanxi side remains obstinate, which proves that their will is divided and efforts are still needed to resolve the situation. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to road news, snowfall along the western section of the Longhai Railway is causing the news from the front to become increasingly quiet. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Recently, people from Shaanxi Province have said that Xi'an is filled with red terror. According to statistics from the Public Security Bureau, more than 3,000 households have moved out. The city is desolate and sparsely populated, but food is still insufficient, and flour has risen to 6.4 yuan per bag. The future of society is extremely bleak. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan Yan Xishan's representative, Liu Shaoting, arrived in Tongguan on the 19th. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan Yang and Zhang's troops have shown no sign of repentance. Since the Red Bandits came east from Gansu Province, both banks of the Wei River have been filled with them. Red terror pervades Guanzhong. The people of Shaanxi Province and the soldiers at the front are deeply saddened by the rampant Red Disaster and the disturbances caused by Yang and Zhang's troops. In recent days, they have come to Tongguan to meet with military authorities, requesting that they report to the Central Government and swiftly issue an order for suppression to restore discipline and relieve the people from their suffering. Reports that there are 2,000 refugees in Tongguan are inaccurate. There are seventy-nine households and two hundred and forty-one family members of Zhang's troops staying in Tongguan. The local authorities have provided them with relief and they have no worries about their livelihood. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Sources concerned have stated that the post-settlement of the Shaanxi-Gansu issue is causing anxiety because Yu and Yang still obstinately refuse to cooperate. (19th Dispatch)</p>

On the afternoon of the 19th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Wang Guang stating that all the departing nationals were still en route from Tongguan to Luoyang and would arrive in Luoyang in the evening. Wang and Mr. Bockelridan, an official from the US Embassy, will leave Luoyang on the 20th to return to Nanjing after all the nationals have passed through Luoyang. It is expected that a portion of the foreigners will arrive in Nanjing on the 21st, and a portion will pass through Nanjing and transfer to Shanghai. Regarding the path to resolving the Shaanxi Incident, a large number of Red Bandits have joined Yang Hucheng's troops and are moving east. The front line is feeling the pressure, but no conflict has occurred. The sound of gunfire east of Chishui was due to a local misunderstanding between Yang and Zhang's troops. The Central Army is only adopting a monitoring and containment stance. All parties are still working to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Wang Shuchang visited Mo Dehui and Liu Zhe on the afternoon of the 19th and talked for an hour. Wang originally planned to fly to Lanzhou this week to take office, but has now decided to postpone his trip. Zhu Chunlin, Bao Wen-yue, and Li Zhigang are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 20th. Whether they will go to Shaanxi again or stay in Nanjing temporarily will be decided after their arrival. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] According to telegrams received this morning by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Embassy, seventy-five foreign nationals from Xi'an left the city safely by bus and arrived in Tongguan yesterday. Currently, only three British nationals and two Russian nationals remain in the area. It is expected that they will be flown out of the area by plane today. When the Eurasia plane arrived in Xi'an at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, preparing to transport the foreign nationals out of the area, it was learned that the seventy-five nationals had already left the area, so it flew back to Luoyang that evening. This morning, it flew Lieutenant Colonel Fraser, Deputy Military Attaché of the British Embassy, and Colonel Barrade, Military Attaché of the US Embassy, to Xi'an. Furthermore, the group of foreign nationals who left Xi'an by bus yesterday was accompanied by Captain Scott, Deputy Military Attaché of the British Embassy. After they safely arrived in Tongguan, Mr. Scott returned to Xi'an to monitor the departure of the remaining five foreigners. It is expected that the five will arrive in Luoyang this afternoon. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] This area has received a reliable telegram from Luoyang stating that the batch of foreign nationals who arrived in Tongguan yesterday all voluntarily withdrew from Xi'an. They are expected to arrive safely in Luoyang by car today. It is believed that the flight of Lieutenant Colonel Fraser and Captain Barrade to Xi'an is mainly to persuade the five foreigners currently remaining in Xi'an to evacuate as soon as possible. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to transportation circles, although most of the foreign nationals in Xi'an have safely escaped to Tongguan by bus, not all of them have arrived. Therefore, the Eurasia mega-plane flew from Luoyang to Xi'an again on the afternoon of the 19th to continue to transport them. It is expected that all of them will arrive in Luoyang within a few days. Chief Wang Guang must wait until everyone has arrived in Luoyang before returning to Nanjing to report on his mission.

<p>[Nanjing] The City Silk and Cloth Industry and other Trade Associations recently sent a telegram to the Central Government requesting the suppression of the rebels, and telegraphed the whole country unanimously advocating this position. The original telegram stated briefly that Yang Hucheng and others are stubborn and incorrigible, colluding with the Red Bandits, summoning bandits, and occupying Xi'an. Recently, the situation in Guanzhong has been chaotic, and military movements have been frequent, their intention to sell out the nation and subvert the country is obvious. They are insane, isolated from humanity, and truly resented by both gods and men and intolerable by heaven and earth. The Central Government has an inescapable duty to rectify discipline and uphold the foundation of the country and should no longer tolerate and accommodate them. They should resolutely make a decision, promptly issue an order to suppress the rebels, and fully quell the rebellion, and Zhang Xueliang should be immediately and publicly punished as a warning to those who endanger the country and stir up trouble. If any of our citizens have a breath left, we vow to be the central government's backing to exterminate the ugly elements. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Hubei Provincial Party Department and various popular organizations believe that Yang Hucheng and others colluded with the Red Bandits and their rebellious actions are obvious. On the 19th, they sent a special telegram to the Central Government requesting that troops be dispatched to eliminate the rebels, and telegraphed the whole country to unanimously advocate this position. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Yuehua organizations such as the Saigon Overseas Chinese Xingren Society, the Overseas Comrades Society, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Xingye Society, and the Guangzhou Physicians' Association sent separate telegrams to the Central Government on the 19th, requesting that an order be issued to suppress the rebellious Yang and Yu to rectify discipline and save the people of Shaanxi.

<h3>Fellow Northeasterners Residing in Beiping and Tianjin Issue a Letter to the Northeastern Soldiers</h3>
<p>"Unite and Obey the Central Government or Surrender a Unit to the Central Government"</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Fellow Northeasterners residing in Beiping and Tianjin believe that the internal situation in Shaanxi is complicated, with the Qin Army rebelling and the Communists infiltrating, which has a significant impact on the future of the country and the nation. They have recently issued a tearful letter to the Northeastern soldiers, containing over a hundred words filled with tears and sincere emotion. The following is an excerpt of the key points: ㊀ Being Used by the Communists Will Only Lead to Sacrifice: The Communists are insidious, treacherous, ruthless, and inhumane. To date, how many thousands of good people and military officers have been killed? You may be used temporarily at the beginning, but you will inevitably suffer a brutal massacre in an instant. If you continue to obey the Central Government, even if you are not rewarded, you will not suffer this disaster. Even if you are dissatisfied with your treatment, you will not be slaughtered without resistance. Which is better, please consider carefully. ㊁ The Communists are at the End of Their Rope: Do Not Join Them Now: Although there is an opportunity to take advantage of in Shaanxi, it is only a brief resurgence. If you are tempted at this time, it will not be worth it. Observe that the central government's unification is already established and international power is gradually increasing. If you do this, wouldn't you be abandoning the light for darkness, preferring death over life? Which is better, please consider carefully. ㊂ The Southeast of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces is Blocked, While the Northwest is Dangerous: Throughout history, heroes and great bandits who have risen up there have never been able to maintain their position permanently or have met their demise sooner or later. The Communists cannot even establish themselves in southern Jiangxi, let alone in Shaanxi and Gansu. Among you, there are many who know military affairs and surely understand this. This is something that even the unwise can understand. Please consider carefully. ㊃ Gathering of Heroes Will Inevitably Lead to Defeat: Today, there are the Qin Army, the Communists, and you in Shaanxi. Who dares to trust each other? Who would not engage in secret calculations? Engage in intrigues. What will happen if the Northeast Army, the Qin Army, and the Communists join forces? Moreover, each unit is divided into two or more factions. What will happen then? Ask yourself, what are Yang Hucheng and Sun Weiru like? What is the situation with the 17th Route Army and the Garrison Brigade? What is the situation with Zhu Mao and the two Xus? What about the Southern Communists, the Northern Communists, the Old Communists, and the New Communists? Even within the Northeast Army, can they be united? This is impossible. Fellow Northeasterners, we are truly worried about you and do not know how to ensure your safety. Please consider carefully. What has been said above only concerns a corner of Shaanxi and Gansu. The danger is already this great. If we consider the will of the people of the whole country and the full strength of the Central Government, there is nothing that is not dangerous. Because the bandit leaders who have not received military education cannot fight hard battles with regular troops, and the officers who come from the ranks cannot fight hard battles with regular troops either. Most of you have received considerable military education and can calculate all of this one by one. It is truly chilling. However, in our view, it is only a matter of your thoughts. Not only can you turn danger into safety, but you can also turn misfortune into blessing. If you are thinking of your ancestors' graves, your parents, your wives, your children, your country, your nation, your homeland, then the four words "correcting the wrong" sum it all up. It is also possible to unite and obey the Central Government or surrender a unit to the Central Government, to take the head of the Communist bandits and kill them to avenge the hundreds of thousands of compatriots, or to capture the arrogant and fierce generals in Qin and present them. He who knows the times is a great man. A true man should not live in this world without taking advantage of opportunities and acting righteously and for profit. Do a successful about-face and become famous! (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Bandits and Puppet Troops in Shangdu Plan to Attack and Harass Eastern Suiyuan</h3>

<h3>We Protest Japanese Aircraft Flying Over Qingdao</h3>

<h3>Japanese Economic Encroachment on China</h3>
<p>Plan to Use Gengzi Indemnity Surplus Funds to Invest in the Development of Roads and Mines in North China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government held an extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 18th and decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would submit a revised legal bill on the special accounting law for cultural undertakings in China to the parliament. The purpose of the revision is to expand the scope of use of the special accounting reserve for cultural undertakings in China in order to invest capital in railways and other economic construction in North China. The scope of use of the existing 36 million yuan in the special accounting reserve for cultural undertakings in China, which comes from the Gengzi Indemnity, is limited to purchasing public prices or depositing funds in the Ministry of Savings. However, the most recent interest rate reduction has caused various inconveniences. Therefore, the purpose of removing these inconveniences is to invest in profitable and reliable undertakings or bonds, regardless of their type. The method of use will be formally decided by the Committee on Cultural Undertakings in China. However, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy, the first method of investment will be to purchase the Treasury bonds of the Chinese Shantung Railway, which are currently held by the Ministry of Finance, for 25 million yuan, in order to promote the future development of economic cooperation in North China centered on the railway. Also, if necessary, the remaining 11 million yuan of the reserve funds will be invested in railways, mines, and other undertakings. If this revised legal bill is passed by parliament and the investment plan can be realized, then the Jinshi Railway, which cannot be started due to lack of capital, can be started, and the Longyan Iron Mine can also be developed, which will be very beneficial for economic cooperation between China and Japan in North China.

<h3>Lessons from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Express Accident</h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Recently, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway express train, en route from Hong Kong to the province, suddenly caught fire near Shilong. Three passenger cars were completely destroyed, resulting in over a hundred casualties. This is truly a major misfortune for railway travel and a tragedy rarely seen in recent times. Since the disaster occurred, it has caused a stir far and wide. Some mourn the irreparable loss of life, while others groan in pain from the torment of injuries. The image of grief is self-evident. Even those who did not directly experience the calamity are unable to remain indifferent to this sudden disaster, based on the principle of human mutual assistance and the response of heartfelt sympathy. For the sake of learning from the past and preventing future occurrences, we are eager to have a thorough discussion to draw attention from all parties. Presuming to express our views, we dare not refrain from speaking frankly.</p>
<p>The train is a convenient tool for shortening time and space and is a necessary pursuit for us. In today's world of frequent human interaction, its usefulness is increasingly appreciated. While the convenience it provides is great, the inherent risks it carries are also numerous. These range from minor incidents like running over people to major ones like derailments and capsizing. There is also the possibility of sudden occurrences like bandit attacks or collisions between trains. According to statistics from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau, there were as many as 320 deaths and injuries in train accidents in the 24th year [of the Republic]. Furthermore, looking at train accidents within the past year alone, there have been incidents such as the axle shearing of a freight train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the derailment of a freight train on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, collisions between locomotives, collisions between two trains on the Longhai Railway, the derailment of a troop train on the Datong-Puzhou Railway, and the negligence of freight trains. In particular, the train collision cases on the Tianjin-Pukou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways caused a great sensation. In Germany, in 1889, there was one accidental death out of 11 million passengers nationwide. From 1930 to 1932, a total of 15 million passengers were carried, with only three deaths. Furthermore, the emergence of other relief methods is sufficient to curb all difficulties. Germany is a scientifically advanced country, and its rapid progress is truly incomparable to that of our country. However, this proves that the safety of railway transportation ultimately depends on human effort. This is something we should deeply consider and strive to improve.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of train safety, the Ministry of Railways has long issued orders to all railways to pay attention. The equipment of the train, the examination of employees, and the investigation of duties are all included in the list of concerns. According to reports, the recent Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway tragedy originated from the explosion of chemical products in the washroom, and the train was not equipped with an alarm system, making it impossible to warn the driver in time. This allowed the fire to spread and become unstoppable. If there had been a thorough inspection beforehand, the chemical products would not have been allowed to be placed carelessly in the washroom. If the train had comprehensive equipment, the train could have been stopped for firefighting, preventing passengers from being affected. It must be understood that negligence is not comparable to a train collision. Rescue efforts can be exhausted. How could such serious consequences as the tragic death of 77 people and the burns of 35 people be brought about? The disaster of repeating the same mistake can no longer be undone in the past. The plan to fix the sheepfold should be alerted in the future. How to strive for the training of personnel is the responsibility of the authorities to earnestly plan its rectification.</p>
<h3>British and German Ambassadors to Italy Return Home on Important Missions</h3>
<p>Studying the Italian-German Plan for Spain. Solving European problems by excluding Russia.</p>
<p>[Rome] Important diplomatic actions are now underway in secret. The British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, and the German Ambassador to Italy, Hassel, departed separately for London and Berlin, carrying a plan agreed upon by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Aviation Minister Göring to resolve the Spanish question. Future developments are noteworthy. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for L'Œuvre, recently published an article on the talks between Germany and Italy and the Spanish Civil War. The article stated, "During their meeting in Rome, German Aviation Minister General Göring and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini drafted a plan proposing that Britain, Germany, and Italy hold talks, and that the Spanish Civil War be discussed first. Then, the issues of security guarantees, the redistribution of raw materials and colonies, and financial and economic issues would be brought up for discussion in sequence. If Britain expresses its agreement, France should be invited to participate in the talks. Once France accepts, Poland should be invited to join as well. However, under no circumstances should the Soviet Union be included. It is expected that British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond will submit an informal report to the British government in the coming days." Mrs. Tabouis also stated that, regarding the Spanish question, certain quarters in Britain urgently hope that Britain, Germany, and Italy will issue a joint declaration stating that only a government composed of moderates in Spain can be recognized by these countries. If so, other countries could join Britain, Germany, and Italy in formulating a procedure for pacifying the situation in Spain, and then convene an international conference to implement this plan.

<h3>Results of Italian-German Talks as Reported by the German Press</h3>
<p>A united front established in spirit. The two countries' diplomacy will advance side by side.</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Hamburger Fremdenblatt recently published an article on the talks between German Aviation Minister General Göring and the Italian authorities. The article, which was clearly inspired by semi-official sources, stated in part: "As a result of the talks between the two heads of state, a united front has been established in spirit. It is certainly true that Göring's trip to Italy was of a private nature. However, it can be asserted that his trip has brought the diplomatic policies of Italy and Germany into alignment, and has laid the foundation for this alignment in spirit. As Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated to a reporter from the Deutsche Nationalzeitung on the 16th of this month, 'Since we know that Bolshevism is the only danger threatening our culture and life, we cannot help but feel that the European countries have a need to unite to deal with it.' This shows that the German National Socialist Party's accusations against the Soviet Union at the Nuremberg Congress in September of last year were well-received by the Italian authorities. Italy and Germany, seeing that communism threatens to attack European countries from a starting point in Spain, are therefore approaching each other in a friendly spirit. As for Britain, the axis formed by Italy and Germany does not conflict with the British-Italian Mediterranean Agreement. Although Britain is currently continuing to recognize the Valencia government in Spain, it must be considered that if a Soviet republic is established in Spain, or if the Catalan Autonomous Region becomes a red republic, Italy will never be able to compromise."

<h3>250,000 Dead in the Spanish Civil War</h3>

<p>[London] According to recent estimates here, there are currently over 40,000 foreign soldiers participating in the Spanish Civil War on the government side, and approximately 32,000 on the Nationalist side. There are fewer than 1,000 Russians, almost all of whom are technicians. The exact number of French volunteers in Spain is not yet known, but rumors suggest as many as 20,000. The remaining foreign nationals assisting the Spanish government in the war include Germans and Italians dissatisfied with their own countries' politics, and there are also approximately 1,000 British citizens, most of whom have not received military training. There are a total of 12,000 Germans and 20,000 Italians among the volunteers in the Nationalist army, most of whom have received training. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Spanish Government and Rebels Submit Replies to Britain Separately</p>
<p>[London] Today, both the Spanish government and the Nationalist forces have replied to the British government's plan, proposed by the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War, to monitor the shipment of military supplies into Spain. The Spanish government does not object to the principle of monitoring but states that the plan does not provide for complete monitoring of the ports controlled by the rebels. The Nationalist forces' reply indicates that the plan is unacceptable, and claims that thousands of French volunteers are currently crossing the border into Spanish territory. The Non-Intervention Committee is now considering a new plan, which is expected to include the issues of volunteers and war materials. The new plan, unlike the current proposal, will not require acceptance by both sides to be implemented. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Nazi Party Activities in Hungary</h3>
<p>Propagating Anti-Soviet and Anti-Czech Sentiments</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: The propaganda machine of the German Nazi Party has recently intensified its activities within Hungary, fiercely attacking the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia without reservation. The Nazi Party has also printed a large number of leaflets in Hamburg, Germany, which are being distributed throughout Hungary by Hungarian landowners and agents of the Nazi Party's correspondence newspaper. The newspaper "Hungarian News," a publication of the new German faction, published an editorial stating, "We must purify national thought so that it is not misled by the works of Lewis, Wells, Thomasson (these three are famous independent writers from England, America, and Germany). Therefore, some enthusiastic young people have volunteered to distribute leaflets in various places in order to correct customs." The "People's News" published a speech by Mussolini, stating, "Democratic thought is sufficient to create the core of the Bolshevik Party. Therefore, all works of liberalism and democracy must be eliminated." (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt to Be Inaugurated Today for Another Term as President</h3>
<p>To Announce Future Policy Directions, Broadcast Worldwide by Radio</p>
<p>[Washington] Of the 30 million people preparing to attend President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, thousands have already arrived in Washington in the rain. Hotel room rates in the capital are expensive, with single rooms now costing at least $10 per night, but those who have come are happy to pay the price and do not mind. The grandstand in Congress Square, which can accommodate 50,000 people, has been completed. President Roosevelt will be sworn in on the steps of Congress and will deliver a speech announcing the major policy directions for the next four years. The speech will be broadcast worldwide by radio. Outside the White House, a reviewing stand has been built, modeled after the home of Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States from 1829. Like President Roosevelt, Jackson was elected for consecutive terms. A viewing box with glass surrounds has been set up in front of the stand. President Roosevelt will receive salutes from tens of thousands of Marines and Navy personnel. Their parade past the stand will take three hours to complete. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Reconvenes with Many Bills</h3>
<p>Preparing to Build Large Warships</p>
<p>[London] Parliament reconvened today after the Christmas recess with many bills to consider. After the meeting began, the Colonial Secretary, Malcolm MacDonald, first reported on his recent talks with the head of the government of the Irish Free State, Eamon de Valera. It is said that the two sides agreed that the trade agreement signed between Britain and the Irish Free State at the beginning of last year would remain in effect. The result of this conversation was that no formal negotiations were conducted. It is expected that this meeting will take a great deal of time to consider all financial needs. Naval experts believe that in addition to building several small warships this year, three new battleships and seven cruisers will also be built. Parliament will also discuss expanding the air force budget and improving the army's treatment and expenses in order to encourage people to enlist. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will propose issuing national defense bonds to fund the purchase of new military equipment, but maintaining national defense spending will come from national taxes, so raising the income tax to five shillings is unavoidable. Parliament will also set civil list expenses for the royal family. Each time a new monarch ascends the throne, this will be enacted. In addition, there is also a special area bill to expand the powers of police officers, as well as a bill to encourage the construction of new industries in distressed areas. This issue will be comprehensively planned in response to the demands of Conservative MPs. At the last meeting, the Conservative Party criticized the current method, which caused public alarm. It is the general opinion that the government still enjoys its former prestige in Parliament. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Secretary of War Said to Be Resigning</h3>
<p>Due to Failure to Meet Enlistment Quotas</p>
<p>[London] Parliamentary sources believe that the Secretary of War, Duff Cooper, may resign in the shortest possible time because he has failed to meet the quota for recruiting new soldiers. It is said that during the constitutional dispute caused by King Edward VIII's marriage, Duff Cooper's stance of vigorously supporting the King went against the Prime Minister Baldwin's wishes, and his position was once shaken. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>[London] The Secretary of War, Duff Cooper, recently gave a speech at a banquet at the Constitutional Club, stating, "The government has no intention of implementing mandatory conscription in peacetime because we do not need a large standing army to defend our territory. What we need is only a small number of specialized troops sufficient for the defense of the Empire." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Secretary of Commerce Counters US Remarks</h3>
<p>Redistribution of Colonies Not Welcomed by Britain</p>
<p>[New York] The British Secretary of Commerce, Runciman, arrived here from his country today and stated to the press, "The policy pursued by Britain is to ensure the security of all countries in the world. We will never use commercial bribery towards aggressor nations in order to achieve appeasement in the economic field." When reporters asked what was meant by "aggressor nations," he declined to elaborate but stated, "Even if Germany's former colonies were restored to it, it would never open a new era of prosperity for its economy." As for resolving general European problems by redistributing colonies, this is also not welcomed by Britain. His conclusion was, "We will never give commercial benefits to any country as a bribe to avoid making trouble for us." Runciman also stated that he was not carrying any mission on this trip. The above remarks were made only in his capacity as a member of the British Parliament and a member of the Cabinet on leave. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Saying They Have Caused the World's Monetary System to Fall Back Into a State of Instability</p>
<p>[Washington] Government officials stated today that they are very concerned about Japan's exchange control plan announced on January 8th. Business circles cannot obtain foreign exchange and have expressed their dissatisfaction to the government. It is also difficult to determine the basis of Japan's control plan.

<h3>US Maritime Labor Strike Negotiations Deadlocked Again</h3>
<p>Automobile Industry Negotiations Also Break Down</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The leader of the International Longshoremen's Association today rejected the conditions offered by management to resolve the labor dispute and proposed an alternative plan, requesting the renewal of the arbitration agreement established after the 1934 strike, but with the following three revisions: ⑴ Wages increased from 95 cents per hour to one dollar. ⑵ Increase wages for "checkers." ⑶ Prioritize the hiring of union members. If the management accepts, the union will seek the opinions of its members. The management immediately held a meeting to discuss the case and then announced that it could not accept it. As a result, the Pacific Coast labor dispute has again reached an impasse. (National Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Detroit: Representatives of General Motors and the union met for three minutes today, and negotiations broke down immediately. Martin, chairman of the automobile industry strike committee, declared that negotiations had completely failed. Our attitude is no different from what was announced last week.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council to Hold Regular Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Assumes the Chairmanship, Feels Great Responsibility</p>
<p>[Paris] The League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to hold a regular meeting on the 21st of this month. The position of chairman is rotated according to the first letter of the names of the member states. This year, it should be assumed by the Chinese representative, Ambassador to France Gu Weijun. Gu Weijun departed from here for Geneva this afternoon. Before leaving, he issued a statement to the Havas News Agency, stating, "I am very honored to be the Chairman of the Administrative Council this time, and the responsibility is extremely important, for two reasons. The topics to be discussed at this regular meeting of the Administrative Council include the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the issue of the Turkish minorities in the cities of Syria and Antioch, and the issue of refugee relief in the Spanish Civil War, all of which are very important. This is the first reason. Many great politicians from various countries will attend this meeting, such as French Foreign Minister Delbos, British Foreign Secretary Eden, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, etc. This is the second reason. Although the various issues raised at this Administrative Council meeting are not directly related to China, I am very honored to be the chairman, both for the country I represent and for myself. As far as the cause of the League of Nations is concerned, although it has experienced difficulties that are disappointing, we should still maintain our inherent belief in the League of Nations in principle. All the great achievements of human civilization cannot be achieved overnight, but often require great hardships and setbacks before the final victory is achieved. The League of Nations is the same. Moreover, the Chinese people are concerned about all attempts to save peace in Europe. If war unfortunately breaks out in Europe, it will inevitably cause a reaction in the Far East immediately, especially given the current situation in China." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: Mexico joined the League of Nations on September 8, 1931. In 1932, it notified its withdrawal due to financial difficulties, but then withdrew the notification and remained a member state. Now that the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting is approaching, in order to show its loyalty to the League of Nations, the Mexican government is about to appoint Mr. Castillo, the former envoy to the Dominican Republic, as a special plenipotentiary representative to the League of Nations.

<p>[Washington] Senator Borah spoke to those advocating for the Philippines today, strongly emphasizing the importance of amicable US-Philippine relations, saying that no matter what attitude is adopted towards a certain event, the peoples of the US and the Philippines must maintain friendly relations. All issues should be adjusted in a friendly spirit. This is not only economically and politically beneficial to the American people, but even more beneficial to the Filipino people.

<h3>New York Silver Market Leaders Advocate Repealing the Silver Purchase Act</h3>
<p>Members of Congress Rise Up in Opposition</p>
<p>[Washington] The New York silver market leader, Handy &amp; Harman Company, published a silver review suggesting that the United States repeal the Silver Purchase Act of 1934. Members of Congress rose up in opposition today. Nevada Congressman Scrugham said that this is the private prejudice of silver merchants. Utah Congressman Murdock also said that the Silver Purchase Act is part of the US monetary policy. If it has not been successful, it is due to the Treasury Department's poor implementation. Congressman Robinson of that state also said that members of Congress from the western states will unanimously oppose the repeal of the law because the price of silver has increased as a result, which has greatly benefited the western states.

<h3>Defendants in the February 26th Incident in Japan Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Sentences Ranging from Five Years to One Year</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Tokyo Military Court has recently thoroughly investigated those with indirect and background relations to the February 26th Incident and is currently deliberating carefully. According to the Army Ministry at 1:58 PM on the 19th, the currently serving officers and some civilians who have been convicted in the case are announced as follows:</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Masui Sokichi sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Captain Suganami Saburo five years, Captains Okura Eiichi and Suematsu Taihei each four years, Lieutenant Shimura Rikujo three years, Lieutenant Shiki Takato one year and six months, Reserve Army Major General Saito Liu sentenced to five years. The above persons were sentenced for the crime of using rebellion in accordance with Articles 30 and 29 of the Army Criminal Code.</p>
<p>Reserve Army Infantry Second Lieutenant Koshimura Sutejiro sentenced to two years of imprisonment, Fukui Ko and Machida Senzo each three years, Miyamoto Masamoto one year and six months, Kato Harumi two years (suspended for four years), Miyamoto Seizo and Sugita Shogo each one and a half years.</p>
<p>The above persons were sentenced for the crime of rebellion in accordance with Article 25, Paragraph 2 of the Army Criminal Code and Article 65, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In addition, two persons were fined for violating the Publication Law. Thirteen persons were acquitted.</p>
<p>Summary of the Facts of the Crime</p>
<p>⑴ Masui Sokichi: After graduating from the Army University in November of the 13th year of Taisho (1924), while serving in the central part of the Army, he came into contact with young reformist officers. He originally opposed direct action, but believed that the current situation could not be changed by legal means, and direct action would inevitably occur in the military or civilian sectors. At that time, he would also step forward to engage in it. When the Aizawa Incident occurred in August of the 10th year of Showa (1935), he attacked so-called privileged classes such as senior statesmen and zaibatsu, praised Colonel Aizawa's actions, and dared to engage in extreme debates, promoting the so-called Meiji Restoration. When the February 26th Incident broke out, Lieutenant Colonel Masui was quite surprised when rebellious generals such as Muranaka Koji occupied key locations in the capital, believing that there was no other way but to resolve the situation satisfactorily. At 3:00 PM on February 26th, he personally went to the residence of the Minister of the Army to meet with Muranaka and others, listened to their hopes and opinions, and conveyed them to the military officers. At 9:00 PM that day, he asked the military councilors who had gathered at the official residence to accommodate the hopes of the rebellious generals and deal with their troops to a certain extent, rather than simply suppressing them, and strongly advocated that they should be handled well. Furthermore, under the plan to organize a strong reformist cabinet the next day, he made requests and wrote proposals to the martial law staff. On the 28th, upon hearing the rebel army's declaration that they would continue to maintain the occupied areas until the restoration was realized, he conveyed the intentions of the rebel army to some of the military councilors and the vice chief of staff and the vice minister of the army, and expressed sympathy for the handling of the rebels in order to resolve the situation, explaining his specific policies. In essence, he wanted to provide the rebels with military benefits.</p>
<p>⑵ Suganami Saburo: When Muranaka and others were investigated on suspicion of conspiracy in November of the 9th year of Showa (1934), he immediately gathered his comrades to discuss countermeasures. When the Aizawa Incident occurred, he also conspired with his comrades in the public trial to carry out their long-cherished ambition and tried to collect campaign funds, giving Muranaka and others several thousand yuan to use for promotional campaigns. When the February 26th Incident broke out, he was determined to put the rebel army in an advantageous position. On the 29th, Lieutenant Shiki of the 13th Kumamoto Regiment went to Kagoshima at his behest to discuss how to respond with friends and persuaded his comrades to resolve to carry out their plans, giving him 45 yuan in travel expenses to return to Kumamoto to benefit the rebellion. Therefore, he should be considered as writing about and giving military benefits.</p>
<p>⑶ Saito Ryu: After being demoted to the reserve force in March of the 5th year of Showa (1930), he served as a director of the Meirin Association. On February 20th of the 11th year of Showa (1936), Kurihara told him that direct action would begin soon, resolving to carry out the Showa Restoration and asked him to raise funds. He then intended to help the rebel actions of the military personnel and urgently tried to raise funds, giving Kurihara 1,000 yuan in cash on the 21st to serve as funds for the rebellion. On the morning of the 26th, Kurihara asked him to come forward, negotiate with the higher authorities, and work hard to resolve the situation. He then put on his military uniform and went to the Prime Minister's residence to express his condolences to the rebels. He also went to the residence of the Minister of the Army to ask the Minister of the Army to respect the claims of the young officers and find a way to handle the situation well. He also told the Vice Minister of the Army of the resolution of the officers, requesting that he find a way to handle the situation well. He was a supporter of the rebels' claims, etc. (Domei News, 19th)</p>
<h3>Bukharin Dismissed from Government Newspaper in Russia</h3>
<p>Suspected of Counter-Revolutionary Case</p>
<p>[Moscow] It was officially announced today that Bukharin has been dismissed from his position as editor of the Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee's mouthpiece newspaper. It is heard that Mr. Bukharin's downfall is due to the fact that last August someone attempted to implicate him in the conspiracy to assassinate Stalin. Although the authorities investigated and proved his innocence, the suspicion could not be completely dispelled. As to whether Bukharin will be interrogated with Mr. Radek, the former editor of Pravda, it is not yet known. It is reported that when Zinoviev, Kamenev, and other fourteen counter-revolutionary leaders were tried last summer, the names of Bukharin and Radek were mentioned repeatedly. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Many traders closed out positions this morning, because negotiations to resolve the labor strike still show no sign of starting soon. Selling pressure is very common. Only oil stocks have good demand. Later, because the buying force is not strong enough, it could not withstand heavy selling pressure, so the price continued to fall. However, before 11:00 AM, the market situation was relatively stable, because there was some buying interest in metal and steel stocks. The market prices of various securities are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Liverpool Cotton: Today steady. The March futures price at the close of the early market was 6.93, the same as the closing price on Monday.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government Established, Huang Shaohong and Others Sworn into Office</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Published Five Guidelines for Governing Hubei</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The new Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Huang Shaohong, arrived in Hubei on the 15th. At 10:00 AM on the 16th, he held a swearing-in ceremony with Meng Guangpeng, Director of Civil Affairs; Jia Shiyi, Director of Finance; Wu Ting𩗺, Director of Construction; Zhou Tianfang, Director of Education; Lu Zhu, Committee Member and Secretary-General; Yang Kuiyi, Committee Member; and Wu Guozhen. Only Committee Member Fan Xiji was unable to attend because he was supervising work on the remote embankment. He Chengjun was sent by the Central Party Department of the Executive Yuan to supervise the oath in advance. Chairman He presented the seal and delivered a speech. Peng Guojun, Special Commissioner of the Provincial Party Department, Gao Yihan, Supervisor of Hunan and Hubei, Wang Xinggong, President of Wuhan University, and gentry Fang Benren delivered speeches one after another. Mr. Huang replied with a speech, outlining five points for his administrative policy: First, I personally believe that the political tasks undertaken are equivalent to the tasks undertaken on the battlefield. Taking office today is the same as going to the battlefield. We must first have the greatest determination, because Hubei is located in a crucial area. If there is no sufficient determination, it will be difficult to seek its governance. What is determination? It is to be loyal to one's duties. Second, we plan to pay attention to promoting national defense education in the future. At present, the country attaches great importance to education, but local public education still lacks practical results. Therefore, the current task should be to make the general public aware of the dangers of the country's situation, cultivate a clear national concept and a strong fighting consciousness, be able to understand things, distinguish right from wrong, and be able to fight against all unrealistic theories and evil forces. In this way, we can save ourselves and seek the eternal survival of the country and the nation. Hubei's education in the future will require it to be in line with the current extraordinary era. In other words, it is necessary to implement national defense education during extraordinary times, so that the people of the province have national defense thinking and national defense knowledge to cope with all current crises. Third, there is the issue of public security. The promotion of all political plans is based on local stability as a prerequisite. If public security is poor, all political construction is empty talk. When it comes to public security, of course the army bears the most direct responsibility. At present, the army responsible for local public security includes the national army and the security team. However, the national army is not stationed in a fixed area, nor does it have a fixed time, and it is frequently transferred. Therefore, the army that actually bears the responsibility for local public security is still the security team of each province. There are as many as 18 security teams in Hubei, and the annual military expenditure is more than 4 million yuan. With such a large army and huge amount of money, if it still cannot bear the responsibility for public security in the entire province of Hubei, it is a shame for the Hubei security team. Therefore, in the future, the public security of Hubei will be hoped to be borne by the Hubei security team. At the same time, in order to enable it to bear this responsibility, the Hubei security team will be given a necessary reorganization. Fourth, there is the issue of water conservancy in Hubei. The floods in Hubei have caused great harm. Almost more than half of the counties in the province are prone to floods. Hubei has been suffering from droughts and banditry for many years, almost all of which stem from floods. Therefore, the issue of water control is an urgent task for Hubei's future administration. Fifth, there is the issue of finance. The financial foundation of Hubei is not very stable. Most of the province's budget relies on subsidies from the central government. The central government's subsidies are based on special tax revenues, which are very unsound. Finance is the foundation for political advancement, so reorganizing finance is the most important thing. However, when it comes to reorganizing Hubei's finances, it is necessary to first reorganize the province's land tax. Hubei has a vast area, and the existing land tax burden is extremely light. This does not mean that land tax should be increased, but that land tax that is not taxed should be reorganized. If the above-mentioned important policies are not fully implemented, then everything else will be out of the question. Of course, we must concentrate all our efforts to implement national economic construction in the future. The economy is the center of modern politics. Hubei, where the countryside is declining, especially needs to be rescued by economic construction. For example, the promotion of agriculture, the improvement of cooperative undertakings, and the improvement of rural finance all need to be implemented step by step. Today, I will just briefly report my personal determination and the direction of future administration to Supervisor He and all the guests. I hope you will give as much guidance and help as possible, and I hope that all colleagues will do their best in accordance with this policy, and I hope that the people of the province will supervise and encourage them from the sidelines. After the speech, the ceremony was announced to be over. (January 16)</p>
<h3>Lianghuai Salt Transport Office Rectifies Salt Affairs on the Anhui and Henan Shores</h3>

<p>Bengbu Communication: The Anhui and Henan shores are the largest sales shores for Huai salt outside the Yangtze River shores, with annual sales of more than 1.6 million dan and tax revenue of no less than 10 million yuan. The area covers 21 counties in northern Anhui and 16 counties in eastern and southern Henan. The tax procedures are as follows: the regular tax is collected on-site by the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and the surtax is collected locally by the Bengbu, Xiba, Sanhejian, and Zhumadian tax offices. The agency responsible for salt affairs administration is the Lianghuai Salt Transport Office. The agency responsible for inspection, tax collection, weighing, and release is the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Inspection Office. In recent years, in order to unify authority and improve efficiency, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy to also serve as the manager of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office to comprehensively manage administrative tax collection affairs. Here is a record of its rectification of salt affairs:</p>
<p>Old Counties on the Shores, Added Counties</p>
<p>The Anhui and Henan shores are the Huai salt administrative transportation and sales area mixed between northern Anhui, eastern Henan, and southern Henan. Northern Anhui originally had 19 counties. Due to changes in county governance, the sales shores are roughly the same, but the number of counties has increased accordingly. Although Yingshan has been劃歸划歸管轄，仍然劃歸管轄，仍然皖豫岸內，原來仍然仍然個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠貽個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠個縣，為盯貽定遠五河泗縣，靈璧靈璧，鳳陽，鳳陽，懷遠，蒙城，渦陽，毫縣，鳳台，壽縣縣，潁上，阜陽，太和，霍邱，霍邱霍邱霍山山山山山，嗣添新設之嘉山，嗣添新設之嘉山山，嗣添新設之嘉山，嗣添新設之嘉山山山山山山，計二十一縣，豫境添設經扶縣，加之原來固始，商城，潢川，光山，息縣，羅山，信陽，信陽，新蔡，上蔡，汝寗，正陽，西平，遂平，確山十四縣，計十五縣，皖豫岸全岸共計三十七縣，均為自由販運區域。</p>
<p>Regulating Supply and Demand, Recruiting Merchants to Transport Salt</p>
<p>Huai north originally for salt production area. In recent years production increased day by day. Each field accumulated. Anhui and Henan shore thirty-seven counties, in recent years due to social and economic increasingly decline. People salt buying ability to compare difference. Therefore sales sluggish. Supply over demand. Gradually taxed heart tax reduce influence national treasury greatly minister. Lianghuai salt transport makes concurrently Lianghuai salt affairs inspection office manager Yao Yuanlun, have see and this. Special in planning Huai salt Changping storehouse case within. Stipulate each shore adds to transport to store salt and pay tax method. Merchants enlist amount undertake do. As for adjust supply and demand plan. Report by Ministry of Finance approved. Anhui and Henan shore also in its row. Anhui north and Henan Ru guang such as fifteen counties. One time each adds to transport 400,000 Dan. All is top first pay tax. At first although after transport merchants beautiful show dissent. End with local authorities insist very strength. Situation in will do. And admit transport salt of merchant. Comeback actively pay tax. Successively release transport new salt. New policy then implement unimpeded. As understand Bengbu. Mingguang. Guzhen. Sanbu. Last year already adds to transport ten more million Dan. Henan RugGuang such as fifteen counties merchant place transport new tax salt. Also will near two more million Dan. All is along with system inserts to sell. Not transport then successively release transport.</p>
<p>Improving Transportation, Reducing Freight Rates</p>
<p>Huai salt is sold in Anhui boats, transported from the Salt River to Xiba, and then from Xiba to Wuhe, Lantai, and Bengbu, and then distributed to various counties. However, in autumn and winter when the water is low, it is necessary to go from Xiba to Gaoliangjian. Sailing ships cannot travel, so ox carts or small carts are used to transport them to ships going out of the lake. Therefore, merchants often apply for sea transportation, transported by轮船to Pukou, and then by train to Bengbu. In recent years, salt from the Anhui and Henan shores has mostly been loaded at Dapu or Xinpu, passed through Xuzhou, and then transported to Bengbu, making Bengbu a hub for train-sea-river salt transportation. Those sold in the 15 counties of Henan such as RugGuang are mostly loaded by車at Dapu or Xinpu, transported to Zhengzhou, and then transferred to Zhumadian or Xinyang. Recently, because車transportation costs more, sea transport has been changed to export, arriving at Wusong and entering the Yangtze River, directly to Hankou, and then transferred by車to Xinyang or Zhumadian for unloading, which is more economical. The authorities are now concentrating the salt market after the arrival of車-sea-帆 transport, and are urging merchants to make full use of modern transportation才transportation tools, such as highway汽車 Huaihe small rounds to transport in separate ways, not only the freight rates are reduced, but also the time is saved.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Infringement of Sales, Maintaining Tax Revenue</p>
<p>The Anhui and Henan shores transport and sell top-quality salt produced in Taiping, Zhongzheng, and Daxinwei in northern Huai, with an annual amount of more than 1.6 million dan, accounting for 30% of the salt released from the four fields in northern Huai. Each dan is taxed with a regular tax (that is, field tax) of 4 yuan, a central surtax of 2 yuan, and a JianTuo fee of 0.1 yuan, which is higher than the tax rate on neighboring shores. Therefore, infringement of sales by neighboring salts is unavoidable, especially in the past year, the infringement of sales by light-tax salts from the six shores of Jiangsu was very serious. The six shores are Huaiyin, Huai'an, Siyang, Su County, Suining, and Pi County, because they belong to the near-field area, so the salt tax rate is lighter, which is the so-called light-tax salt. Since there is infringement of sales, the shore sales are affected, and the tax revenue is also sharply reduced. For example, in the 24th year, the Bengbu Salt Affairs Tax Collection Office collected more than 2.6 million yuan in surtax, while in the 25th year, it only collected more than 2.4 million yuan. The authorities have tried their best to crack down on and prevent the infringement of sales by light-tax salts in order to maintain tax revenue. Last year, the captured illegal salt amounted to 617 dan, all of which were confiscated. After active crackdown, the trend of infringement of sales on the Anhui and Henan shores may be reduced, and the salt sales and taxes in the 26th year are also expected to increase. (18th)</p>
<h3>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce's Views on the Collection of Income Tax</h3>
<p>Four Practical Issues Raised, Personnel Sent to Shanghai to Participate in Research</p>
<p>Wuxi Communication: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to study various practical issues in the collection of income tax, sent a letter to chambers of commerce in various places to recommend representatives to hold an income tax research meeting from the 20th to the 25th. In addition to recommending Qian Sunqing, Jiang Zhongliang, and Li Bosen to participate in the meeting in Shanghai, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce also raised four opinions based on the actual situation: ㊀ The account books used in commerce are mostly old-fashioned bookkeeping, which has long become a habit. If you want to change suddenly, there will inevitably be many difficulties. In recent years, Jiangsu Province has vigorously implemented the accounting system, and all agencies have uniformly switched to new-style bookkeeping, and the printing paper has suddenly increased several times. However, merchants in the interior, especially small and medium-sized ones, seek profits and seek profits. It is difficult to do this with nuclear costs. According to Article 24 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, the income declarer should submit a property catalog, a profit calculation statement, a balance sheet, or other account books and documents sufficient to prove his income amount at the time of declaration. It is also known that the commercial account books should be listened to according to their habits and should not be changed suddenly, so as not to hinder the progress of tax collection. ㊁ According to Category 3 of Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, the interest income from deposits is similar to the current accounts in merchants. It seems that it should not be directly regarded as a deposit. Merchants' operating capital often waxes and wanes with time. The current accounts are also often in debt, but they are only used for turnover. It is not a loan nature. It is different from fixed deposits, which do have interest income. Now that merchants have to collect business income, the current accounts, even if there is occasional interest, will still be taxed at the same time in the future, and the tax revenue is very small. The current accounts of merchants should not be compared with fixed deposits, and the interest income should be calculated separately, which is double taxation. ㊂ Since the development of banks, floating capital has entered the city, resulting in tighter silver roots and more depression in the interior. The commerce in various parts of Jiangsu Province is related to the Shanghai market. Foreign economic aggression also takes Shanghai as its base camp. If income is suddenly levied in the interior, and the interest income of foreign banks cannot be handled uniformly, merchants' capital will inevitably escape to foreign banks. Although there are strict laws and severe penalties, it is only to drive away the雀. It is proposed that the government should contact all foreign banks to settle the matter. Before it can be handled uniformly, it should not be collected suddenly, so as to leave some room for the national economy. ㊃ According to Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, an examination committee should be established to regulate officials' standards, which is beneficial to tax collection. Now that income tax has been collected, the organizational regulations of the examination committee have not been drafted. If there is any disagreement in the future, what will be decided? The Ministry of Finance should draft organizational regulations to facilitate taxation and should not be treated as a pending case. The above four items have been sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for public research yesterday to avoid hindering and facilitating implementation.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou Transportation Bureau Dredges Shallow River Channels</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, in order to dredge the shallow river channels in the territory of Jiangdu County, such as Wantou, Baotawan, Dongguan, and Xu Ningmen, specially instructed the Jiangdu County Government to generally use the winter water to dry up and the river body to narrow. The ships that come and go are relatively crowded. It is not easy to dredge to the middle of the river. It is ordered to inform the upstream and downstream ships to slow down when approaching the dredging section, and send two police officers to the construction site to direct them at all times to avoid danger. It is reported that the County Government has followed the instructions of the Public Security Bureau to send police officers, and has posted notices to the round bureau to comply.</p>

<h3>Sun, Chen, Feng, and Others Said to be Withdrawing from the Port Team</h3>
<p>Indicated Unwillingness to Go to Hong Kong and Participate in the Second Trial</p>
<p>The annual Hong Kong-Shanghai Port Football Match has been scheduled to be held in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year. The Shanghai Westerners Football Club is selecting representatives. The first trial was held last Sunday, and the result was quite unsatisfactory. The second trial has been scheduled for this Sunday (24th). The trial list has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. Of the six Chinese team members selected last time, only half of them got the chance to play. The rest, Jia, Li, and Chen (Zhenxiang), have been abandoned, and the relationship between the club and the Eastern China will become worse. According to the reporter of Guoguang News Agency, Sun, Chen, and Feng have formally expressed their unwillingness to participate in the port team and the second trial. Therefore, the Shanghai Port representative team this year will become an all-Westerner situation. However, with the overall withdrawal of the Chinese team members, the club is even more stretched for personnel allocation, and its strength will be greatly affected. It is also learned that the club has decided that the maximum number of representatives for this local team is 18. It has notified Hong Kong to change it to 17 people in order to save expenses. However, according to the usual practice, one manager should be sent, so some people advocate that Gaxu, the captain who does not attend the game, should also serve as the manager, because Gaxu is very familiar with Hong Kong, and can also serve as a reserve member for the mainstay. In addition to Gaxu, there is really no suitable person for the captaincy in the Shanghai team.</p>

<h3>Northeastern University Severely Punishes Students Involved in Incident</h3>
<p>Giving Expulsions and Demerits Separately; Injured Students to File Lawsuit</p>
<p>(North China News Agency) Northeastern University students, on the morning of the previous day, due to the issue of food, in the South campus that a bloody melee occurred. The lightly injured students on both sides have gradually recovered after their respective treatments. Except for Jing Simin, the severely injured students who were sent to the hospital did not show significant changes. Yesterday, the North, South, and East campuses were all calm and proceeding as usual, starting the term exams. Except for a small number of students who did not return to school after being involved in the assault the previous day, most of the other students were able to take the exams in peace. As for the students who were taken away from the incident the previous day, the school authorities have already issued a letter of guarantee yesterday. The school authorities, considering the matter to be serious, held a training committee yesterday afternoon to punish the students involved on both sides. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The school strictly punishes the students involved: The school authorities, considering the matter to be serious, cannot but punish the students involved. A training committee was specially convened in the school office at 1:30 PM yesterday to discuss and decide on the punishment of the students involved.

The following is a record of the notice: ㊀ Northeastern University Dong Zi No. 31, this school, on January 2 and 17, a small group of students used wooden sticks to beat each other, resulting in several injuries. This is considered to be a violation of school regulations. All of these students are exiled students, and at a time when their homeland is in trouble, they should be diligent and united, but instead, they have engaged in internal strife, resulting in tragic incidents. This is very regrettable. The main perpetrators and participants in the two incidents have been thoroughly investigated and discussed by the training committee, and they have been punished according to the severity of their circumstances. Shi Yi, Li Futong, Guo San Xue Zhenjia, Shi San Yang Xiaofei, Jing Er Wu Shixuan, Zhang Shangzhou, and other nine people will be expelled from school and must leave the school immediately.

Principal Zhang Xueliang, Secretary Director Zhou Jingwen. ㊁ Northeastern University Dong Zi No. 33, Wang Daren, Guo Si, Yang Yi Zheng, Guo San, and Liu Nanlu, Jing San, have each received demerits three times in a row. According to Article 2, Section 2 of Chapter 4 of the school rules, "those who have received three major demerits will be forced to withdraw from school." They will all be forced to withdraw from school and must leave the school immediately. This notice is hereby issued for the students to comply with. Principal Zhang Xueliang, Secretary Director Zhou Jingwen.</p>
<p>The condition of the severely injured students: After the incident the previous day, a total of nine severely injured students from both sides were sent to the Central Hospital by the school authorities for treatment. Later, fearing that students visiting injured classmates would cause a confrontation in the hospital, Jing Simin and two others were transferred to the Renren Hospital on Xidan North Street on the same night. Except for Jing Simin, who was still seriously injured, the others gradually recovered. Of those staying at the Central Hospital, Wang Daren's left eye was more severely injured. He has been able to see people after treatment. Xue Zhenjia's head and brain injuries were the most serious, and there was no change, but he fainted from time to time. Li Futong's arm injury has gradually healed. Zhang Guowei's injury has gradually healed, but he has not yet been discharged from the hospital. Those staying at the Renren Hospital, Ben Yi and Zhang Shengtai's injuries have not yet healed, but there have been no adverse changes. The most serious case is Jing Simin, who is unconscious. According to the doctor, if he does not develop meningitis within a week, his life is not in danger. Fearing an accident at 4:30 PM, he has been transferred to the German Hospital.</p>
<p>Classmates comfort the injured and file a lawsuit</p>
<p>The school's student union believed that the previous day's mass brawl was caused by a misunderstanding among individuals. It sent two representatives at noon yesterday, carrying fruits and snacks to the Central Hospital to comfort the injured. According to the injured, "We are extremely grateful for your personal feelings, but we dare not accept the student union's good intentions." The representatives returned to school at 2 PM. Other students at the school have visited various hospitals to offer comfort. According to the injured students staying at the Central Hospital, "We were groundlessly instigated by the school authorities and student union officials to be brutally beaten by dozens of students. We have decided to file a clear lawsuit with the local court." The defendants in the lawsuit are Zhou Jingwen (the school's secretary director), Xu Zhonghang (the school's secretary), Wang Yifu, Ting Rongmao, Wang Yuzhang, and Jiang Rongsheng (the above four are student union officials).</p>
<p>Term exams start on the 18th</p>
<p>The North and South campuses are calm. Except for the police guarding the brawl, the students in the school are taking the exams in peace.

<p>The Exchange Rate of Copper Coins Is Difficult to Recover; The Reason Lies in Buying and Melting Them Down; Investing 1,000 Legal Tender Can Yield a Gross Profit of About 70 Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate of copper coins has shrunk sharply. At first, the general psychology thought that the situation affected the rates but would soon return to normal. Who would have thought that the news is now calm, but the exchange rate of copper coins is still only around 2,900 articles. Although this is due to the year-end relations, there are various major reasons behind the scenes. According to the author's vision, the future is difficult to recover. Since the implementation of legal tender, of course, the old copper coins are recycled, recast, and the new currency is realized. Over time, the old copper coins in the market will inevitably decrease, but the key is not only this. It is because someone is speculating on copper coins and profiting from them. The speculators' procedures are also very simple, but it is more difficult to recruit a principal. Today, times have changed, the form and weight, the psychology of the people, the gradual increase in the price of copper, and the factory's emphasis on raw materials have made a part of the people take speculative measures to gain a small profit. Accumulating less makes more, and the surplus is also considerable, and the exchange rate of copper coins is difficult to recover because of this. Now, let me state one of the speculative methods as follows:</p>
<p>Try to exchange for 2,900 articles of copper coins from the smoke exchange industry with one yuan of legal currency. The types of copper coins are very complicated, but only two types can be distinguished by quality: thick and thin. According to the current situation, the ratio of thick purple copper coins to thin copper coins is about 7 to 3. Suppose someone exchanges 1,000 yuan of legal currency for 29 million articles of copper coins (including 30% thin copper coins) and takes out the thin copper coins, which is about 8.7 million articles, and then exchanges them for thick purple copper coins (about a discount loss of one cent per legal tender, which generally requires about four exchanges to complete), then the loss of legal tender is 5 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen. The cost is 1,005 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2.5 fen. However, the previous 8.7 million articles of thin copper coins have now been exchanged for thick copper coins. The ratio of the weight of thin copper coins to thick copper coins is about 80%. Then the weight of the 8.7 million articles of thick copper coins is equal to 10.875 million articles. Plus the original 20.3 million articles of thick copper coins, it is equal to 31.175 million articles. The ordinary copper factory's purchase price is about 3 jiao and 4.5 fen per thousand articles of copper coins (the market price of one yuan of legal tender exchanges for 2,900 articles of copper coins). Then the copper coins of this person are 31.179 million articles, and selling them to the copper factory can get 1,075 yuan and 5 jiao of legal tender, minus the principal of 1,005 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and a gross profit of about 70,000 yuan can be obtained. This is just a general situation, and the speculators' means and methods can make people unpredictable.</p>

After the opening, the Nikko Bank continued to dig up and settle the current East Exchange. Foreign banks worked hard to settle forward shillings. HSBC's listing was flat for both British and American currencies, and the silver balance tax did not move. The situation was fluctuating. The North Gang still sold East Exchange, and Nikko Bank still accepted it cheaply and could still support it. Chinese merchants slightly bought forward US dollars, which were slightly softening.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Spot Goods Cashed Out Recently; Public Bonds Continue Downward Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange continued to decline. Market sentiment was also quite weak. Both long and short positions were actively engaged in swap transactions. However, due to a certain major player continuing to sell off large quantities of spot goods recently, the supply and demand of chips on the surface was uneven, and market prices tended to fall again. Retail investors were still buying, so the market situation in the afternoon was slightly firmer. At the opening yesterday morning, the market situation was extremely weak. No. 47 on behalf of a certain financial giant specializing in collecting Category C short-term bonds, while selling off Category E, D, and other four types. Retail investors were quite keen to buy, so the market price only rose by five cents for Category C bonds, while the rest fell by one to four dimes. In the second session, No. 47 continued to see large-scale selling of Category E and C bonds, while No. 50 and 72 were eagerly buying. Category E and A bonds fell by five cents to four dimes, while Category B and C bonds rebounded by five cents. At the opening in the afternoon, the trend gradually hovered. No. 47, 11, and 23 sold off a lot. Retail investors and No. 50 and others were still buying. Category E, D, and C bonds rose by five cents to one dime, while Category B and A bonds weakened again by about one dime. The closing market was fairly stable.

As a result of the whole day, all fell by five cents to four and a half dimes. Category C bonds for this month rose by two dimes. The total number of components was 7.27 million yuan. The comparative table of their rise and fall, high and low, is as follows:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Sales are Stagnant; Trading in Futures Yarn is Especially Lacking</p>
<p>Even Though Grade Three Yarn Has Risen: It Only Brought Up the Market by Several Dimes</p>
<p>The yarn market is mediocre and the atmosphere is stable. As the final accounting period is approaching, yarn sales are stagnant. Customers and brokers have no intention of taking action. Therefore, people's minds are idle, and neither the long nor short positions intend to move. Therefore, transactions are very rare, and market prices lack significant changes. As for the long position, they still do not give up on tightening the February futures. However, a part of them are exclusively selling February futures. The future is difficult to predict. In short, the fundamental problem is actual demand.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Alone is Small in February Futures; Spot Yarn Pre-Market Opening, Short-Term Sales are High, Long-Term are Ordinary</p>
<p>After the first session, it was heard that Tian Gu Grade One Yarn had risen by four yuan this month. In addition, long-term prices rose by two yuan. Market sentiment turned firm, and floating shorts slightly covered. Market prices rebounded by a few dimes, but the transaction volume in the field was very scarce, and the fluctuation was not large. The results of spot yarn for each month rose by three, four, or five dimes compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, Grade Three Yarn's telegram said that the price rose again by three or four yuan, and the market atmosphere rose again by several dimes, but the transaction was still lacking. Before long, it was heard that the transaction of spot yarn was less than 500 bales. The market re-entered a state of fatigue. However, Osaka's Grade Three Yarn closed higher again, rising by four yuan to nine yuan six dimes compared with the previous day. The results of spot yarn in March rose by two dimes compared with the morning closing price, and the February and April futures fell by three or five dimes. It was found that 1,100 bales were sold: Ju Yu 750 bales, Zhen Da 610 bales, Da Chang 700 bales, Jin Chang 500 bales, Geng Feng 410 bales, Heng Yi 350 bales, and Fu Kang 350 bales. The purchases were: He Xing 950 bales, Yuan Yi 450 bales, Run Kang 650 bales, Ren Feng 500 bales, Yong Chang 700 bales, and Tong He 800 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Selling Price Drops by One Yuan; Spot Yarn Sales Market is Quiet</p>
<p>It was found that the total number of bales purchased by various brokers throughout the day was only 438 bales, and the single price dropped by one yuan. The purchase amount of each broker is listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Market is Almost at a Standstill</p>
<p>The cotton market does not break away from the situation of market makers. The overall trend has nothing to do with honor or disgrace. The market is in a state of scatteredness. The price difference throughout the day is only between one and two dimes, which shows that people's minds are lazy. At the same time, spot cotton transactions are stagnant and factory stomachs are blocked.</p>
<p>Fluctuation Range of Spot Cotton Becomes Narrower; Spot Cotton Pre-Market Opening, Each Month is Flat and Weak, the Market is Unusually Dispersed, and There is Absolutely No Sign of Revival</p>
<p>Although American cotton rose by one or two pounds, Indian cotton fell sharply by two or three rupees. Therefore, people's minds were ordinary, and buying and selling in the market was especially lacking. However, Osaka's Grade Three Cotton rose by three, four, or six dimes. Scattered shorts slightly covered, rebounding by five cents. The results for each month rose by five cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the afternoon opening, although the telegram of Grade Three Cotton said that the price rose again, the market was still deserted. There was very little fluctuation after the first session, and the market state felt more dull. The results for near-month contracts fell by one dime compared with the morning closing price, and far-month contracts did not move. It was found that Yu Da sold 3,300 piculs, Feng Tai 2,100 piculs, Tai Chang 1,900 piculs, Yi Chang 1,900 piculs, Run Kang 1,200 piculs, Chang He 2,400 piculs, Ming De 900 piculs, Yuan Da 900 piculs, Geng Feng 900 piculs, and Zhen Da 900 piculs.

The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>There is Only One Transaction in Cotton; Spot Cotton Consumption is Light, Factory Demand is Stagnant, the Source is Yao Cotton 1,568 bales, Tong Cotton 1,982 bales, Shashi Cotton 51.00, Minfeng Factory Entered 5,400 Pieces, Spot Goods Stored and Delivered</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Farmers Continue to Sell Enthusiastically</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened because Liverpool's telegrams were not good, the automobile strike was unfavorable, longs closed out, and cotton farmers sold off excrement. Each month fell by three to seven pounds. Before the problem of borrowing money for cotton was resolved, merchants mostly took a wait-and-see attitude. Later, there was a need for a large number of colleagues in near-month contracts, but there was still a lack of new accounts. At the same time, there were some swaps, and some bought October futures to offset the sale of September futures of dried oil. The footing of low-grade spot cotton was relatively soft, and the short positions covered when attacking. Colleagues bought at eye prices, and the trend was very firm. It is estimated that spot goods rose by one pound, and futures fell by one pound to rise by two pounds. British cotton spot goods fell by four points, and futures fell by one point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to short positions selling off, and then rebounded due to local factories buying, and finally weakened again due to cotton farmers cashing out. It is estimated that Pingguo fell by 1.5 to 2.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 2 to 2.5 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 18th).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 19th was: Bairoxi was 227.5 rupees, Aomula was 204 rupees, and Pingguoer was 179.25 rupees, all rising by 1 rupee.</p>

Cotton futures rose by one yuan to one yuan six dimes five cents, recently was 75 yuan three dimes five cents, and far-month was 77 yuan seven dimes.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Exports are Quite Smooth</p>
<p>Cloth Transactions Have Turned Stagnant</p>
<p>Hankou Express News: The cotton market in this city is still stable, and there are sources of coarse and fine velvet in the production area. The sales market is strongest for the Shanghai brokers and exporters. Yuhua Yarn Factory and Japanese firms, Nisshin, and Toyo Cotton Foreign Company also purchased, so the paths for all parties are still not stagnant. The total transaction volume converted to city weights is 6,058 piculs, and another 8,000 catties. The selling price has increased by one or two dimes compared with the previous price. Also, since the new year, the customer stomachs of cotton cloth have been fatigued. Besides occasional sporadic transactions in colored and fine cloth, there are very few inquiries for coarse cloth. The price of cloth has fallen by five cents to several dimes per bolt due to the weak price of yarn.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Actual Sales are Stagnant; Flour Plummets by Eight or Nine Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning, and each month showed a consistent and miserable slump. As for the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was slightly better by 48 cents, while Canada fell by about two dimes. After the opening price, the people's minds were still stable because there was still little foreign wheat entering or leaving. However, because this month is close to delivery, actual sales are still stagnant, resulting in floating longs outside the industry, which have been discarded and cannot be discarded, so they have to be gradually sold off. Therefore, people's minds are very weak, and the market is falling sharply, and there is no way to save it. After all, speculation longs and customer transactions are different. One can draw profits, and the other is purely for the purpose of making profits, and did not consider the sales market at the beginning. Until the afternoon opening, the degree of decline in the market became even more violent. The opening price in January and February actually fell by one dime compared to the previous day and stopped. Fortunately, the people's minds in March were more stable and did not reach the limit. Therefore, by the second session, the former abandoners had risen to resist the trap, and the long side gradually prolonged their last gasp, slightly better near the minimum. According to speculation in the industry, it is believed that if actual sales are not active, the market will still be difficult to stand still.</p>
<p>The standard for this month will be auctioned until the 25th, and delivery will be handled from the 26th.</p>
<p>Heavy Snow in the North Road; Wheat Prices Plummet</p>
<p>The Most Violent Long-Term Price Reached One Dime and Seven Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, each month saw a violent slump. As for the quoted price of foreign wheat, the trend was still difficult to revive. In the near-term, since flour sales were not moving, wheat could not be surprisingly expensive. Those with goods were thinking of selling them. As for the long-term months, due to heavy snow in the north road, there was a sign of a bumper year. Therefore, most people's minds had generally softened. Therefore, after the opening price, transactions in near-term and far-term were very few, and prices fell by five, six, or seven cents. Until the afternoon opening, due to the heavy slump in the flour market, the people's minds outside the industry were also unable to support it, and they sold off one after another. Therefore, the market turned sharply downwards again, and the downward trend was very violent. It is estimated that near-term contracts fell by eight cents, and far-term contracts fell by one dime and four cents to one dime and seven cents. The spot wheat market has stagnated and has not seen any transactions because the factory stomachs have stopped and the standards have plummeted. The standard for this month will be stopped until the 25th, and delivery will be handled from the 26th.</p>
<p>Dalian Soybean Telegram Reports a Fall</p>
<p>Local Bean Prices Become Flat; Foreign Companies' Sesame Still Maintain</p>
<p>Soybeans: Yesterday, under the frequent falls in Dalian, the soybean market situation, people's minds were uniformly softened. Transactions in the market were unusually deserted. Northeastern soybeans and train soybeans were not opened in bags. Only 500 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans, 600 bags of Late soybeans, 250 bags of Jiujiang Winter soybeans, 200 bags of Late soybeans, and 42 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow soybeans were opened. Prices fell by four or five cents.</p>
<p>Sesame: Foreign companies' sesame was handled by the Central Trust Bureau, 750 tons, and the selling price was maintained. The original plate was 15 yuan and one dime and a half. If the subsequent situation is as greedy as handling the stomach, the market may fall.</p>
<p>Guest Yuan Rice Alone Rises by a Dime</p>
<p>Yesterday, the de-hulling of the guest Xian rice was still sluggish, and the market continued to fall. Only Yuan rice from Shantou and this street inquired. There were still nearly 2,000 bags of transactions in the unified market, and the market price saw a step-by-step increase of a dime. Other coarse grain Xian rice all returned to cut by four or five cents to nearly a dime. In fact, because the end-of-year collection is approaching, the guests intend to stop, and Guangdong has recently had contacts with Hunan rice and foreign rice, which is even more of a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, in addition to Yuan rice, only Quanzhou took 400 bags, Shantou took 100 bags, and Guangdong brokers took 249 bags. The rest were all handled by this street. The total number of transactions throughout the day was about 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Hexia Rice is Excellent in the North City</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 30 Dongyuan brokers arrived, with a total of 6,230 stones of goods. The sales market on this street was even more deserted than before, and the bag stomachs were also lax. Only Qingdao brokers handled more than 1,000 bags of Bo Dao, which made it even more difficult for the market to revive. The Bo Dao market was unchanged, but the situation was stable with a soft trend. Hou Geng was still lingering and did not enter the store. The price fell by another five cents. Du Yangjian also dropped by a dime due to the higher price. Yin Yuan also followed down by a few cents.</p>
<p>(Zhabei) Yesterday, there were 34 Hexia sources. The stomachs of the goods in the market were damp and cloudy. The stomachs of the stores were still quite bad. The market shape of Bai Geng was stable. The price of Bo Dao was excellent and the price of Early Dao was also tightened. The prices of Yin Bian Yuan and various Xian rice were not much up or down.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Coarse Cloth Market Becomes Active Again</p>
<p>Although the domestic and foreign cotton yarn market situation lacked good signs yesterday, domestic cotton cloth business has been rising and falling. The actual sales momentum in this quiet settlement period is already not weak. Moreover, the price of fine yarn is very firm, and futures are especially high. Printed goods and cloth have lively customer traffic. Recently, various dyeing factories continue to sell short. Colored cloth, seeing that white goods are gradually softening, temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude and refuse to resist entering, resulting in increasingly light actual sales of white goods. The market price falls again and again, gradually arousing buying intentions. Currently, factory prices are still firm, but the stock of goods in the market has suddenly become short. Various dyeing factories and cloth shops are rushing to resist replenishment. The market voice is rebounding due to short covering, with each bolt rising by five cents. Transactions are becoming lively. Coarse cloth is also becoming active because spot sales are gradually becoming lively. The Yangtze River brokers and Guangdong brokers search for 11-pound and 13-pound coarse cloth. Mainland brokers and this street search for 9-pound coarse cloth. The Yihe Factory's products in the market are becoming tense again. The factory price for heavy-weight 16-pound goods is very high. Colleagues and military uniform brokers continue to place orders. The four-month futures of 14-pound coarse cloth Hengfeng Factory opened 600 pieces, which is said to be the reason for the military clothing industry. Therefore, the coarse cloth market has become active again. The momentum of printed goods and dyed cloth is also good, and the market price is generally stable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Golden Needle Vegetables Have Activity in Guangdong and Fujian</p>
<p>Golden needle vegetables have recently had activity from Guangdong and Fujian brokers, and market sentiment has turned low. Yesterday, the top grade vegetables opened at 28 yuan, and rural village vegetables opened at 27 yuan and two dimes. A total of more than 60 bags were opened. The market price of the top grade vegetables sold by brokers was 28 yuan and eight dimes, Da Yu vegetables were 28 yuan and three or four dimes, Yanghua rural village vegetables were 28 yuan to 27 yuan and a half, and Xuzhou vegetables were 26 yuan and five dimes. The market situation is Lanxiu.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Kirin Mian Chi Opens at Sixteen Yuan and a Half</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft. The association drew the price of 24 raw sugar white spot goods at 23 yuan and three dimes and a half, which was not achieved. The transshipment goods were 7 yuan and seven dimes and a half, and there were some transactions, which was a little less than one dime. Dongbai spot goods No. 4 was 23 yuan and three dimes, and No. 8 was 23 yuan, both one dime less. The rest of the original prices were unchanged. The cotton white of this factory, Dahua No. 1 was 22 yuan and three dimes, No. 2 was 32 yuan, one color, No. 3 was 21 yuan and nine dimes, No. 4 was 21 yuan and seven dimes, and No. 5 was 11 yuan and a half. Chao brokers opened 171 bags of Wu Gao Kirin brand cotton red in the market, and the price was 16 yuan and five dimes, which was two dimes higher. The newly arrived Anhai Red Tong Diao Qing is still negotiating the price and has not yet formed a plate. The Da Xiang Diao Qing may continue to be small.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Overseas Silk Prices Have All Seen a Miserable Fall</p>
<p>—The Shanghai Market Plate is Still Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk markets in Japan and the United States both saw a fall. It is estimated that the special prices of New York Japanese silk at 83 cents and 75 cents and Huasi all fell by five cents. The exchange sold at a price of 8.5 cents for near-term contracts and 6.5 cents for far-term contracts, which is equivalent to a decrease of 33 yuan, 3 dimes and 2 cents per load in the Shanghai market. The Lyon silk market was stagnant and did not move. Yokohama spot goods fell by 33 yuan, and far-term contracts fell by 21 yuan. The Shanghai silk market saw a slight opening yesterday. The market plate has not been greatly affected. Users of silk are still only slightly purchased by Hangzhou silk factories, and the price is quite stable. A total of 114 packages were sold.</p>
<p>African Tea Sales Are Gradually Becoming Active</p>
<p>The sales of African green tea had become stagnant due to the tense relations between Germany and France. In the past two days, the situation has become slightly more active. Yihua, Xiehe, and other firms in this city, as well as Huacha Company, etc., have sent telegrams to sell the remaining Zhenmei green tea on the market due to the low price. And because the end of the general accounting period is approaching, they are paying for the goods that were transacted in the previous two months. It is said that Jinlong, Baolong, and other firms, as well as Caiye Trading Company, will ship more than 3,000 boxes of green tea to Africa this week.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>— Xi Dongshu</p>
<p>The expansion of credit, the rise in material prices, and the consumption of public prices are all sufficient to increase the government's burden on wartime finance. It is better to increase taxes in a simple and direct way, because if the government's purchasing power is reduced, the use of human and material resources will be in an unfavorable position. High prices cause farmers to feel extreme pain in their lives. Not to mention, it is better to add taxes than to borrow debt, which has been generally recognized by economists. Some people say that war is not only for the survival of the people of the present day, but also for the benefit of the people of future generations. It is better to give debt first and let future generations share a part of the burden. How do you know that modern warfare is a constant cycle? Future generations may have their burdens. It is impossible to push the burden of modern economy to future generations. Moreover, those who hold public bonds have not made any sacrifices during the war, and they are sitting idly by and eating their profits, which creates an unfair burden on the economy. Public bonds are just a temporary substitute for taxes. The destination of public bonds is ultimately taxes. If debt is raised to pay for war expenses, it must be accompanied by an increase in tax revenue, so that it is sufficient to pay the interest on the public debt and a part of the debt principal, otherwise the government's credit will be shaken, so that public bonds cannot be issued in the future, which is tantamount to shooting oneself in the foot. Therefore, the sound method of planning wartime finance is to increase taxes to a high degree, so that they cannot be increased any more, and use public bonds to meet the urgent needs of the temporary and make up for the insufficient amount, so that the issuance of public bonds is limited to the lowest amount possible within the possible range. When former British Prime Minister Lloyd George submitted a tax increase bill to the National Assembly in November 1914, he stated, "The tax rate should be increased during wartime, and then lowered when peace is restored. This method is easier, because the patriotic hearts of the general public spontaneously arise during the war, and they do not hesitate to sacrifice everything." During the European War, Britain always tried its best to increase taxes to pay for war expenses. The proportion of taxes in its war expenses was the largest compared to all the belligerent countries in Europe. Later, the United States also paid the same attention to taxes. Therefore, it was easy for Britain and the United States to restore their finances and economies to normal after the war. Germany did not increase taxes from the beginning, and completely paid for war expenses with public bonds, hoping to be compensated by the enemy countries after victory. It was not until the third year after the start of the war that it decided to increase taxes. France also leaned towards the path of public bonds. Although it was victorious in the war, the post-war finances were unusually chaotic. It took a long period of consolidation before it entered the right track. Germany need not be mentioned. We have the lessons of the past, and we should make a decision to increase taxes at this time of being prepared for a rainy day, and prepare for the collection of considerable direct taxes. According to the British wartime direct taxes, the war tax was 73 percent. During the American war, direct taxes accounted for 79 percent of the war tax, which shows the importance of the status of direct taxes. At this time, we should quickly set up direct tax institutions, in order to achieve rapid results in the future. Now I will briefly describe the various direct taxes that can be used during wartime.</p>
<p>(1) Income tax. This tax has been implemented in various countries around the world for a long time, and it is indeed the most reasonable tax. Fortunately, the government has decided to adopt it. It is true that the legislator Chen Changheng said (1) The scope of income tax is wide, which is suitable for the principle of tax proliferation. (2) Income tax determines the differential tax amount according to the size of the people's ability to bear, which is suitable for the principle of tax fairness. (3) The income is rich, which is suitable for the principle of tax richness. (4) Income tax is levied based on the people's actual income, which is suitable for the principle of a sure tax. (5) Income tax is flexible, and countries often consider it to be suitable for regulating national revenue and expenditure. Brother pro-tax, for the flexibility of income tax, is extremely important during wartime. During the European War, the highest income tax in Britain was 10 shillings and 6 pence for every 20 shillings. The highest peak of income tax in the United States reached 77 percent. This type of flexible direct tax is most suitable for the needs of finance in extraordinary times. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Various Circles Telegraph the Central Government to Punish Zhang and Yang</h3>
<p>Chinese Seamen and Representatives from Various Organizations: Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, a joint meeting was held in the meeting room of the Special Party Department of the Chinese Seamen. A unanimous resolution was made to telegraph the central government requesting a clear order for punishment. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Yang as a final word of sincere advice. The original telegram is as follows: ⑴ Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: In the recent Xi'an Incident, the Central Government, with a magnanimous heart, originally intended to preserve national strength and give Yu Yang and others a chance to reform themselves. They should have been grateful and repaid the country with loyalty, atoning for their past transgressions. Unexpectedly, their wolfish ambitions remain unrepentant. Recently, they have colluded with the Red bandits to harm the country. Their rebellious actions are evident, and the law is unforgiving. We humbly request a clear order for punishment to curb the chaos and uphold the law. We send this urgent telegram with utmost sincerity, humbly requesting your consideration. Chinese Seamen, Chinese Ships, Wireless Telegraphers Public Welfare Association, Chinese Maritime Navigators Federation, Chinese Marine Engineers Federation, Chinese Customs Wheel Pilots Association, Chinese Yangtze River Pilots Association, Maritime United Righteousness Society, Merchants Ship United Benefit Society, North Jun'an Sailors Association, South Jun'an Sailors Joint Benevolent Society, Yan Ying Nan Society, Yan Ying Tong Xing Society, Maritime Helmsmen Carpenters Mutual Aid Association, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Tallymen's Association, New Taikoo Tallymen's Club, Shan Zheng Trade Association, Jardine Matheson Tallymen's Club, Yan Ying General Society, China Merchants Bureau Jun'an Association, Maritime Safety Travel Association, Outer Port Tallymen Mutual Assistance Association, Little Yangtze River Club, Jardine Matheson Rear Cabin Benefit Society, Sanbei Hongan Mutual Assistance Association, and other twenty-four organizations, respectfully inquire and stamp. ⑵ To Mr. Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Mr. Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, for your consideration: The telegram has been sent. The Central Government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident has been compromising and extremely tolerant. If you truly have a conscience, you should turn over a new leaf, be grateful, and repay the country. However, according to rumors, you have actually colluded with the Red bandits, reorganized the militia, constructed fortifications, requisitioned civilian labor, and actively engaged in war preparations, disregarding the Central Government's orders and the people's sincere advice. This is akin to recklessly challenging danger and heading towards your own demise. We urge you to pull back from the precipice, repent sincerely, and not cause pain to your loved ones and joy to your enemies. We offer this sincere advice once again, hoping for your wise consideration. Chinese Seamen, Chinese Ships, Wireless Telegraphers Public Welfare Association, and other twenty-four organizations, respectfully inquire and stamp.</p>
<p>Both Railway Workers' Unions: In a telegram to the Central Government, they stated: Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Military Council: In our previous telegram, we requested the suppression of rebels and the completion of unification, humbly requesting your consideration. We believe that the Central Government's handling of the special Xi'an Incident was solely aimed at preserving national strength, protecting the soldiers, and showing painstaking consideration and tolerance. Zhang Xueliang, Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others should have been deeply grateful, obeyed orders, reported to the Central Government with gratitude, and thanked the people for their expectations, striving to make achievements to cover up their past mistakes. However, recently, they have shown no remorse. Zhang Xueliang deceitfully conceals his intentions and dares to secretly instigate his subordinates to create disturbances. Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others dare to occupy the Northwest, collude with the Red bandits, and mobilize troops, plotting rebellion. Their rebellious actions are evident and cannot be tolerated. Military and administrative governance must have discipline. Disobeying orders and resisting with arms should be severely punished. Zhang Xueliang's early loss of power and humiliation of the country are already unforgivable. Now that he has intensified his actions, he should be publicly executed as a warning. We send this special telegram to the Council and the Departments, requesting the swift punishment of Zhang Xueliang and a clear order to punish Yang Hucheng and his cohorts, suppressing the rebels and eliminating the bandits. The so-called nurturing should be sufficient to leave a legacy of trouble. A single spark can start a prairie fire. It is impossible to grant further leniency, which would lead to misleading the country and harming the people. We send this urgent telegram in apprehension, humbly requesting your consideration. Railway Workers' Unions directly under the Ministry of Railways, Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) Railways, respectfully stamp.</p>
<p>City Farmers' Association: Together with the district branches, they telegraphed the Central Government, stating: Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, and the Military Council: At a time when the soldiers defending the border are bravely fighting the enemy and triumphant news is frequently reported, coinciding with the joyous occasion of victory for the people, unfortunately, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Our Central Government, with a magnanimous heart, and Chairman Chiang's great spirit, continue to make peaceful decisions regarding the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident, hoping for a change of heart from the misguided. All those with a conscience should repent and serve the Party and the country to atone for their past transgressions. Who knew that Yang Hucheng of Xi'an and Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou would propagate fallacies, stubbornly resist, disregard the Central Government's policies, treat the nation's destiny and people's lives like worn-out shoes, harbor evil intentions, and undermine unity? Their rebellious actions are already clearly exposed and cannot be tolerated any further, lest they leave future troubles. Therefore, we telegraphically request your Council (Government) to swiftly issue an order for punishment, eliminate the source of the disaster, eradicate the great evil, and restore discipline. We send this urgent telegram with utmost anticipation. Shanghai City Farmers' Association and the Farmers' Associations of South Shanghai, North Shanghai, Gao Hang, Jiangwan, Gaoqiao, Wusong, Fahua, Chan Jing, Pudong, Yangsi, Yangjing, Yinxiang, Yinhang, Pusong, Pengpu, and other districts, respectfully inquire and stamp. (Da Gong She)</p>
<p>City Education Association: The Professors and Writers Association and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Social Science Society, and other three organizations, urgently telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government yesterday, requesting severe punishment for Zhang Xueliang to uphold discipline and swiftly dispatch troops to punish the rebels Yang and Yu. The text of the telegram is recorded as follows: Respectfully to Chairman Chiang, Vice-Chairman of the Central Party Headquarters, and Chairman Wang of the Central Political Council, and Chairman Lin of the National Government in Nanjing: Since the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident, the people of the whole country have been filled with grief and indignation. Regarding the rebel Zhang Xueliang, everyone believes that even ten thousand deaths are not enough to atone for his crimes. Subsequently, the rebel Zhang respectfully escorted Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing and awaited punishment at the national gate. The people of the whole country generally advocated for public execution to uphold the national law. Considering the rebel Zhang's crimes throughout his life, when he established a feudal separatist regime outside Shanhaiguan, he deserved death; when he failed to resist on September 18th and lost four provinces, he deserved death; this time, he committed a great outrage by detaining the commander-in-chief, deserving death. There are many reasons for him to deserve death. However, our Central Government repeatedly showed tolerance, hoping that he would reform himself. When he established a separatist regime outside Shanhaiguan, he was appeased with an envoy and favored with the position of military and political chief of the Northeast. After losing the Northeast, he was sent to Europe and America to study. Upon his return, he was entrusted with the important task of suppressing bandits in the Northwest. This time, he colluded with the Reds, rebelled, and detained the commander-in-chief. The people of the whole country wanted to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. However, his sentence was first reduced by ten years and then he was granted a special pardon. The Central Government's treatment of the rebel Zhang can be described as infinitely generous. What reason could there be to oppose such kindness? If the rebel Zhang had the slightest conscience, he should have slit his throat to apologize to the people of the country. How could he still shamelessly live in this world today? Now, the rebel Zhang not only has no remorse but is also plotting and scheming to secretly instigate war. He has instructed Yang and Yu to rebel in the Northwest and coerced the officers and soldiers of the Northeast to obey the Central Government and act in unison, reaching a point of madness beyond redemption. If we show any more leniency, it would be tantamount to fostering evil and tearing our own entrails. Therefore, we request that you, the leaders, make a decisive decision and swiftly execute him publicly as a warning. The rebels Yang and Yu have not appreciated the Central Government's kindness in removing them from their posts but retaining them, and they are willing to be Zhang Xueliang's henchmen, rebelling to the end. We urge you to swiftly dispatch troops to suppress them as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will become a source of trouble, and the flames of the Reds will inevitably reignite in the Northwest, making it impossible to discuss resisting aggression and saving the country. The situation is urgent, and we cannot choose our words carefully. We respectfully request your adoption of our suggestions. The nation and its people will be fortunate. The Shanghai City Education Association, the Shanghai Professors and Writers Association, and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Social Science Society, respectfully inquire and stamp.

<h3>The Guangxi Inspection Delegation Departed for Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Delegation Leader Zhang Renmin Issues a Written Statement: Expressing Gratitude for the Hospitality and Praising the Efforts to Rebuild</p>
<p>The Guangxi Domestic Inspection Delegation visited various cultural institutions and factories in Shanghai and attended banquets hosted by various circles. Having completed their tasks, they departed by train for Hangzhou at 1:40 PM yesterday. Delegation leader Zhang Renmin issued a written statement before leaving, detailing the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Farewell from All Circles: The delegation attended a banquet hosted by Pang Tianjue, manager of the Hua'an Hequn Life Insurance Company, at 8:30 AM yesterday. Subsequently, at 1:40 PM, they went to the North Railway Station to board the train for Hangzhou. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, representatives Zhou Yongneng and Li Dachao, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Secretary Wang Zhinan, Chairman Chen Guangfu of the Bankers' Association, representatives Zhou Sizhong, Hu Xiyuan and Wang Zhisheng of the Chinese General Chamber of Industry, and others went to see them off. The Garrison Headquarters also sent a military band to play music at the station. The delegation prepared several gilded copies of "A Glimpse of Guangxi" and distributed them to leaders from various circles in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Future Itinerary: After arriving in Hangzhou, the delegation will stay for three or four days and then proceed to Jiaxing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and the capital, to pay respects to the central authorities. In Nanjing, they will wait for the Third Plenary Session to conclude before going to Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, Taiyuan, and Suiyuan for inspection. Then, they will go to Hankou and return to Guangxi via the Yuehan Railway to Guangdong. The estimated duration is more than two months. China Travel Service has specially assigned Chen Ligang to provide hospitality along the way.</p>
<p>Written Statement: Delegation leader Zhang Renmin issued a written statement on the train, stating that the delegation members were warmly welcomed by the local military and political leaders, business circles, and various sectors during their visit to Shanghai. They were not only treated to lavish banquets but also enlightened. Furthermore, they were grateful to the Chinese General Chamber of Industry for dispatching Mr. Wang Zhisheng to guide them in observing various industrial, commercial, and cultural constructions, which benefited the delegation members immensely. They also felt that the strength of the country and the nation primarily requires the prosperity of the national economy, which can consolidate and perfect all military and national defense. Moreover, the current economic warfare is even more important than military warfare. Fortunately, the people of all circles in Shanghai can support each other and strive to improve. In this extremely depressed situation, they can still work hard and strive for recovery. It is a pity that the time was too short to listen to their teachings thoroughly. Moreover, due to the hurried departure for Hangzhou, they were unable to bid farewell to everyone in person, which they deeply regretted. If there is an opportunity in the future, they will come to Shanghai again for a long discussion.</p>
<h3>The National Medicine and Pharmaceutical Circles Welcomed Director Jiao Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the evening, Director Jiao hosted a banquet for the medical, pharmaceutical, and ginseng industries to exchange opinions on the construction of the National Medicine Hall and its funding.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Medicine Hall, the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, the Medicinal Materials Industry Association, the Chinese National Medicine Association, the Shenzhou Medical Association, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese Medical College, the New China Medical College, and others, jointly organized a general meeting of all members of the national medicine, pharmaceutical, and ginseng circles in the city yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the auditorium of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Yu Qiaqing Road to welcome Mr. Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Medicine Hall. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. In the evening, Director Jiao hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel for leaders of the national medicine, pharmaceutical, and ginseng circles in Shanghai to exchange opinions on the construction of the National Medicine Hall and its funding. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Staff: The presidium of the general meeting consisted of Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, Mao Zijian, Shen Zhongfang, Gu Weichuan, Shi Jiqun, and Ding Jiwan. Jin Changyuan served as the master of ceremonies, Jiang Yuanfang as the recorder, and Chen Chuxiang, Zhu Hegao, Huang Baozhong, Dong Bowei, Gao Ziwen, Dai Dafu, Shen Xiangpu, He Yunsheng, and Yu Tongfang as the receptionists.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the formal ceremonies, the chairman, Du Yuesheng Shen Zhongfang, delivered a welcoming speech, briefly stating that Director Jiao of the Central National Medicine Hall has spared no effort in safeguarding our country's medicine and pharmaceuticals. Last year, the government promulgated the Regulations on Traditional Chinese Medicine, giving our country's medicine and pharmaceuticals a legal basis. While drinking water, one should think of its source, which is all thanks to Director Jiao. We, the comrades, are extremely grateful to Director Jiao. Today, in order to make our country's medicine and pharmaceuticals manifest in reality, Director Jiao is building a National Hospital in the capital, with a grand vision and significant results. Due to limited funding, Director Jiao has taken the time to come to Shanghai to discuss with our medical and pharmaceutical circles. I believe that our medical and pharmaceutical circles will actively donate to this grand undertaking to ensure its successful completion. Yuesheng Zhongfang and others are delighted to have the opportunity to listen to his great insights. We have jointly organized this general meeting of representatives from all sectors of the national medicine and pharmaceutical industries in the city to welcome Director Jiao and express our sincere admiration. I respectfully present these few words for your consideration.</p>
<p>Director Jiao's Instructions: Next, Director Jiao delivered instructions, briefly stating that our country's medical and pharmaceutical industry has a long history. In order to preserve the national essence and improve the national medical industry, the Central Government has established the Central National Medicine Hall and plans to establish branches in various regions. The Legislative Yuan has also passed the Regulations on Traditional Chinese Medicine, giving the national medical industry a legal basis. Medicine is a way to protect the health of the nation. The national medical industry is trusted by the majority of our people and has its own indelible advantages. Although it has been attacked by the Western medical community recently, observing the Western medical community, those from Europe, America, and Japan each practice their own techniques and have their own theories. It is questionable whether they can replace traditional Chinese medicine. However, our national medical community should remain calm and not feel discouraged by attacks. We should thoroughly research the national medicine that has been passed down for thousands of years and adopt the strengths of medicine from various countries to supplement the shortcomings of national medicine. There are more than two million practitioners of national medicine throughout the country. If they can unite and study diligently, they will surely achieve great results. Currently, public associations have been organized in various regions of the national medicine and pharmaceutical industries, which is a manifestation of unity. The establishment of schools and national medicine halls also demonstrates the spirit of research in our country's medicine. In the future, we should use scientific methods to improve the national medical industry, and the future of national medicine will definitely be bright.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang's Reply: After Director Jiao delivered his instructions, Mr. Fang Jiaobo gave a reply, briefly stating that Director Jiao's enthusiasm for the national medical industry has allowed the national medical industry to regain its momentum and flourish amidst various slanders, which is deeply appreciated by our medical and pharmaceutical circles. Today, Director Jiao has personally come to provide guidance, and we should follow Director Jiao's teachings, work hard, and express our gratitude. Subsequently, Gong Xingqi, Shang Jianqing, Mao Zijian, and others successively delivered speeches. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Director Jiao's Banquet: Director Jiao hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel at 6:00 PM yesterday for leaders of the national medicine, pharmaceutical, and ginseng industries in the city, with dozens of attendees including Shen Zhongfang, Gao Ziwen, Gong Xingzhai, and Ding Jiwan. During the banquet, they exchanged opinions on the fundraising for the construction of the National Medicine Hall. Those invited expressed their willingness to do their utmost to assist in promoting its early completion. Director Jiao had been away from Nanjing for a long time and had important official duties awaiting him in Nanjing, so he returned to Nanjing by train last night.</p>
<h3>The President Wilson Resumes Service as the First Ship to the Far East</h3>
<p>The American Sailors' Strike Partially Resolved: Departing from San Francisco on the 23rd</p>
<p>Since the American sailors' strike, all the mail ships and cargo ships of the American China Line of this port, including the Dollar Steamship Lines, the American Mail Line, and the Pacific Steamship Company, have completely ceased service. Since the departure of the Dollar Lines McKinley President, the last ship to arrive in Shanghai on November 13th of last year, more than two months have passed. The huge losses suffered by the various shipping companies are immeasurable. Two weeks ago, a private telegram was received here from the United States stating that the stoker and steward departments of the sailors had reached an agreement with the employers on the terms of resumption of work. However, there was no further news. Until yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, the Dollar Steamship Lines in this port received an urgent telegram from the American head office stating that a part of the sailors' strike had been resolved. The company's President Wilson will be the first ship to resume service to the Pacific and sail back to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to depart directly from San Francisco this Saturday (the 23rd).</p>
<h3>The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Held a Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng Yangfu, Chairman of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. He went to the company's general management office in Shanghai to give instructions on business and convened a meeting of the standing directors. Standing directors Li Shizeng, Song Zi'an, Lu Zuofu, Liu Zhujun, and others attended the meeting. During the meeting, they reported on the company's business and decided to commence construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing section, which will be built first, on the first day of next month. They also discussed the company's articles of association, the organizational regulations of the general office, and the organizational regulations of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau. The organizational regulations of the office consist of twelve articles, which were approved and implemented by the meeting. The company's articles of association consist of eleven chapters and forty-six articles, and the organizational regulations of the engineering bureau consist of twenty-one articles. After being approved by the meeting, they still need to be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and promulgation.</p>
<h3>The Spanish Consulate General is Not Listed in the Directory</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the name of the Spanish Consulate General in the 1937 Shanghai Directory was missing, indicating that the Spanish Civil War is still ongoing. The Spanish Consulate General in Shanghai is located at 1449 Avenue Joffre, which is now closed and uninhabited. Consul General Ferreiro resigned several months ago, followed by Vice Consul La Roche Quiaca a few weeks later. The only staff member who has not resigned is Counselor Victoriano Jing Jingshu, who is currently ill and unable to work. According to Spanish expatriates in Shanghai, it is unlikely that the civil war in their country will end in the short term, so the consulate in Shanghai cannot be reopened for the time being. The situation of the Western expatriates in China from various countries is quite difficult due to the lack of diplomatic representation.</p>

<h3>French Concession Chinese Medicine Stores Strike: Declarations of Support from Businesses in Both Districts</h3>
<p>Guild Asks for Negotiations and Sends Letters to Various Organizations; Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday to Discuss Response Measures</p>
<p>The Chinese medicine businesses in the French Concession of this city, due to the French Municipal Council cutting off water and electricity and forcibly collecting medicine tax, triggered a strike by all businesses in the area the day before yesterday. There is no hope of resumption of business at this time. In addition to requesting the authorities to negotiate and sending letters to various organizations to explain the truth and request assistance, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association also convened an emergency meeting of representatives of the city's businesses yesterday afternoon. Many assistance measures were decided upon at the meeting. All businesses in the city and the First Special District also issued declarations of support. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Firm Determination to Support the Strike</p>
<p>More than eighty Chinese medicine stores in the French Concession of this city, due to the French Municipal Council's implementation of cutting off water and electricity and forcibly collecting the "Chinese Medicine Retail Sales Regulations Tax," launched a full strike at 3 pm the day before yesterday. According to reporter investigations, Daren Tang, Guang Sheng Tang, Taishan Tang, and four or five other companies have had their water and electricity cut off. The remaining pharmacies are mostly striking in support with a very firm attitude. If the Municipal Council does not restore water and electricity to the cut-off establishments first, resumption of operations cannot be expected. The Municipal Council continued to send personnel to various pharmacies yesterday, tearing off the strike notices posted on the doors and prohibiting them from being posted again, claiming that they were disrupting public order. However, it had no effect. The advertising sign in front of Tian Ji Tang on Avenue Edward VII was destroyed as a result, and a worker from Da De Sheng store was also arrested for posting notices. There were no other indications. The order of each business is excellent, adhering to the association's advice. Businesses in the city and the First Special District are equally indignant at this high-pressure policy of the French authorities and have issued declarations of support. According to reporter investigations, if the French Municipal Council shows no sign of realizing its error, they will not hesitate to strike in response, to achieve the goal of abolishing the harsh taxes.</p>
<p>Guild Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the strike broke out, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association reported the facts and requested negotiation to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Second Special District Citizens' Association also sent letters making the same request. Furthermore, at 4 pm yesterday, representatives of all businesses in the city were convened to hold an emergency meeting at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association. More than 300 people attended, including He Yuanming, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yuan Hongjun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jiao Yitang, the director of the Central National Medical Hall, and representatives of the industry. The meeting was chaired by Gao Zhiwen. First, the chairman reported in detail on the negotiations with the French Municipal Council regarding this case, and the painful situation of being forced to strike. Then, representatives from the Party Headquarters, Director Jiao, and others delivered speeches, all hoping for an appropriate resolution soon, and asked all businesses to maintain order in the inevitable situation. Then, the conference passed the following resolutions: (1) No resumption of business until water and electricity are restored; (2) Refuse to pay all taxes before the incident is resolved; (3) Request all industry groups in the French Concession to unanimously support; (4) If necessary, businesses throughout the city will strike in support; (5) Request Party and government agencies to seriously negotiate with the French authorities regarding the barbaric act of cutting off water and electricity; (6) Request the press and various organizations to uphold justice and provide assistance; (7) Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayers' Association to seriously negotiate with the French authorities; (8) Organize a maintenance team to maintain order during the strike to prevent villains from mixing in and causing trouble; (9) All measures are subject to the association's orders and must not be acted upon freely; (10) Measures to maintain stores with cut-off water and electricity: rent gasoline lamps, provide food and water; (11) Restore electricity unconditionally and demand compensation for business losses; (12) The French authorities should guarantee that the same act of cutting off water and electricity will not happen again in the future; (13) Issue a declaration of support from all businesses in the city and the First Special District to the businesses in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Request Authorities to Seriously Negotiate</p>
<p>The Chinese Medicine Industry Association submitted separate requests to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning, requesting serious negotiations. The original request stated: The French Municipal Council's cutting off water and electricity has triggered a serious situation of full strike, and we implore you to negotiate seriously. The French Municipal Council's attempt to force Chinese medicine stores to pay harsh taxes by cutting off water and electricity has already been reported to your association and bureau, and we implore you to quickly forward a letter to stop it. Fortunately, the deadline of the 12th has passed, and the problem can be resolved through proper channels. Unexpectedly, at 3 pm yesterday, the water and electricity of Daren Tang and Guang Sheng Tang and other Chinese medicine stores in Baxianqiao were suddenly cut off, and the strike of all businesses in the area was triggered within an hour. It is clear that cutting off water and electricity is a hegemonic means to coerce our tax-paying Chinese, and the desire to exploit them is the Municipal Council's only method. Our tax-paying Chinese have suffered much from their poison. Now, for the sake of self-defense, for the sake of fighting for dignity, and even more for the sake of seeking welfare for all tax-paying Chinese in the area, all businesses in the area are willing to endure the greatest pain and cooperate to silently observe the situation, fearing that it will expand. In addition to submitting reports and requesting assistance from all sectors, we have attached a copy of the medicine sales regulations and a translated copy of the French Municipal Council's reply, requesting your association and bureau to seriously negotiate to avoid expansion and protect business.</p>
<p>Declarations of Support from Businesses in Both Districts</p>
<p>All Chinese medicine businesses in the city and the First Special District of this city jointly issued a declaration yesterday afternoon, expressing support. The original text reads: It is our belief that the addition of new taxes must have a legal basis, and should especially carefully consider whether it is feasible in reality. Going against the tide will only cause trouble. At this time of increasingly severe commercial depression, if the French Municipal Council truly wants to maintain the remaining prosperity within its district, it should properly support and assist it to recover. How can it bear to oppress each other with harsh taxes, accelerating the rate of collapse? Instead, it reveals a ferocious face, using the cutting off of water and electricity as a tool to fulfill its desire to exploit every drop of marrow, obliterating reason and defiling civilization. Nothing is more egregious than this. Our businesses in the entire French Concession, under unreasonable oppression, with the consciousness of self-defense and maintaining dignity, resolutely make the greatest determination and carry out the most painful strike. We, the businesses in this district, in addition to sympathizing with them, are filled with indignation. In addition to urging the Industry Association to strongly protest, we will make practical preparations and pledge to be their backing. We hereby declare this, hoping for public consideration.</p>
<p>Send Letters to Various Organizations to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>The association also sent letters to the Local Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Municipal Women's Association, the Municipal Defense Committee, the First Special District Citizens' Federation, the United Federation of Teachers at All Levels, various industry associations, and various fellow-provincial associations, requesting them to uphold justice. An excerpt from the original letter reads: It is our belief that the French Concession authorities' treatment of tax-paying Chinese is extremely harsh, abusing their authority and cutting off water and electricity. Those who have experienced it mostly turn pale at the mention of it, and all with blood and vigor gnash their teeth. This time, our members in the French Concession, driven by righteous indignation, are willing to strike to deal with the situation. The success or failure, and the gains or losses, are inextricably linked to the future interests of all tax-paying Chinese in the area. We are hereby sending a special letter to you, respectfully requesting you to examine this and uphold justice, and we sincerely ask for your guidance to correct our shortcomings.</p>

<h3>Tea Farmer Representatives from Anhui Come to Shanghai to Request</h3>
<p>Assistance in Developing the Tea Industry</p>
<p>Taiping County, Anhui Province, has always been a tea-producing area. Due to adherence to traditional methods of cultivation and the inflexibility of the rural economy, the excellent famous product (tea leaves) has been buried and unheard of, and the livelihoods of tea farmers have declined day by day. Now, after deliberations by all tea farmers, they are trying to improve the production methods for the purpose of promotion. In order to seek economic assistance and develop foreign trade, Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing have been specially sent as</p>
<p>Representatives of the Tea Farmers to Come to Shanghai to Request the China National Products Maintenance Association of this city to forward their request to the National Economic Council to approve the designation of a bank to set up a temporary office in Taiping County, and to introduce them to participate in the registration of the Tea Industry Control Committee and the International Trade Bureau. Sun and Xu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and brought a letter to the China National Products Maintenance Association for request. The association sent Secretary Sun Zheng to meet them. He decided to forward all the points raised by the tea farmers in the county. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, we have learned that Taiping County in southern Anhui has always been a tea-producing area. In past years, due to rural bankruptcy, the inflexibility of the economy, and the manufacturing process</p>
<p>Adhering to Traditional Methods and the lack of publicity, the excellent famous tea has been buried and unheard of. This year, agricultural production is abundant and the economy is improving. In addition to the original tea mountains, a large number of new areas have recently been developed. The output is expected to increase. More than 70 rural cooperative organizations have been established, and loans of about 80,000 yuan have been issued. The countryside can be remedied, and the future development can be expected. However, due to economic reasons, it is a pity that it cannot be sold throughout the country and the development of foreign trade is hampered. Now, after deliberations by all tea farmers, at this time when the National Government is working hard to promote national products, we plan to imitate the Qimen black tea method, trying to</p>
<p>Improve the Production Process in order to promote sales. Therefore, Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing have been specially sent as representatives of all tea farmers in Taiping County to come to Shanghai to earnestly request your association to introduce them to participate in the registration of the Tea Industry Control Committee and the International Trade Bureau, and to request you to forward this to the National Economic Committee, allowing a designated bank to set up a temporary office in Taiping County to provide assistance nearby, supervise the purchase, and issue loans against the goods in accordance with regulations, and collect documents to benefit the operation and benefit the countryside. It is a matter of promoting the special products of the country, and we implore you to approve the request and to help the rural public welfare. This is to the China National Products Maintenance Association, from all the tea farmers of Taiping County, Anhui Province.</p>
<h3>Australian Trade Commissioner to China, Bowden, Went to Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bowden, the Australian Trade Commissioner to China, recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the British company's Lanra on the afternoon of yesterday at 3:30 pm to handle official business in Hong Kong. He is expected to stay for three to four weeks before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Inland River Bureau Was Ordered to Cease Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Thousands of Employees Petition for Relief</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the routes under the state-run China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau include 23 routes such as Shenhu, Shenhang, and Shensu, with a total of about 40 small ships and company ships. Recently, the Ministry of Communications ordered that all ships on all routes be suspended and closed from yesterday. Thousands of employees of the bureau were panicked after hearing this. After deliberation, Chen Meisi, Xia Tongzhang, Shen Jingyi, Shen Gendi and others were elected to submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau at 2 pm in the afternoon, requesting relief to avoid unemployment of workers. Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section, received them and promised to forward the request to the director for approval. The representatives were satisfied and returned at about 4 o'clock. At the same time, they submitted a request to General Manager Cai of the General Bureau, requesting the Ministry of Communications to revoke the order to suspend operations, and explained their opinions.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing Published Opinions on Planting Cotton in Hainan</h3>
<p>Suitable Climate and Soil to Increase Output; Compete with the World Through Self-Sufficiency and Export</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing, a giant in the industry, published his opinions on planting cotton in Hainan, saying that China is a country based on agriculture, with rice and wheat occupying an important position in agricultural production, followed by mulberry, and then cotton. Since the rise of the textile industry, the Chinese have begun to pay attention to cotton planting, but the output is limited, and most of the raw materials are supplied from abroad, resulting in a huge drain. In recent years, the government has been reviving the countryside,</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Products and Cotton Planting has made rapid progress. Last year's output broke the previous record. However, raw materials above 60 counts are still lacking. The climate and soil are closely related to agricultural production. For example, in Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi, although the spread of cotton seeds has yielded abundant harvests, the climate and soil are mostly suitable for coarse species, not for fine species. Given the vastness of our country's land, the place with the climate and soil suitable for fine species and capable of producing a large amount is Hainan. Hainan is the hometown of Chairman Song of the Bank of China. All that Song has gained from this inspection has been fully disclosed in the newspapers, and his development plan is far-sighted and extremely admirable. I (Rong) run a yarn factory and feel that planting</p>
<p>Cotton is the Lifeblood of Yarn Factories. Considering Hainan's climate and soil, after cultivating Egyptian sea island cotton, our country's fine yarn raw materials will absolutely not be a problem. I have been hesitant about this matter for a long time, and I did not have the opportunity to speak until now. A few years ago, there was a You Xiyin in Wuxi, who was extremely honest and had a special interest in agriculture. He personally went to Hainan to try planting cotton, and the results were excellent. According to him, planting in January and harvesting flowers in June, without encountering wind and rain, the boll is as big as a peach, the fiber is one and three-tenths to one and seven-tenths of an inch, and can be spun into 80-count fine yarn. Each plant can be three or four feet high, like a clump of trees, and does not wither in winter, and can continue for two or three years, but does not produce flowers and fruits, as You said. Unfortunately, at that time, due to economic and personnel reasons, no one helped him and he could not continue his research. Now that Song has the determination to develop Hainan, planting cotton seems to be an urgent task. I think this matter is important and should be presided over by the Cotton Control Association, dispatching</p>
<p>Experts for On-the-Spot Investigation and practical implementation. First, start with propaganda to make local farmers aware that the benefits of planting cotton are better than any other agricultural product. On the one hand, organize cooperatives, concentrate economic talents, from purchasing seeds to harvesting, and concentrate all attention, increase credit, and expand. Take advantage of the weather and make the most of the land. The annual output of 1.5 million bales, Chinese factories 60 counts or more,</p>
<p>Raw Material Supply is More than Enough and Exports can be Greatly Increased. It can be exported and compete with cotton-producing countries in the world. Moreover, harvesting flowers in June is the time when the new and old are not connected. The acquisition of this new cotton is a world-leading move. If it is handled properly, the results can be controlled. Today, European and American countries are competing to plant cotton, and powerful countries are rich in cotton production. Just like our country, this year's cotton production has increased, and the rural business has a clear recovery. The relationship between cotton planting and the national fortune is such that the Chinese should pay attention to it. Before the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, I purchased 200 tons of cotton seeds and transported them to various provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi for planting, and achieved results in rural areas and commerce. If cotton planting is implemented in Hainan, its benefits will be many times greater.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Discuss Opinions on Employees Today</h3>
<p>May Make Some Revisions</p>
<p>The China Mail reports that the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council will meet tomorrow (20th) to accept the criticisms of the Municipal Council's employees on the economic plan. There may be important revisions to this plan. Members of the Employees' Union and many personnel of the Police Department have expressed their opinions on this plan. However, the Police Department's comments and suggestions will be submitted to the Board of Directors later. Chief Inspector Major Joly had asked the Police Department personnel to express their opinions, but Joly is currently on sick leave, staying in Hong Kong and will return to Shanghai before the end of the month, so it will be submitted to the Board of Directors after he arrives in Shanghai. Joly is currently in Hong Kong studying this economic issue. When the report of the Special Economic Committee of the Municipal Council was published last year, the affected employees were asked to express their opinions. Many people believe that the Board of Directors may make some revisions due to the opposition of the employees. It is expected that the situation of the economic plan at this meeting will be published in detail to reassure the public.</p>
<h3>President Yamamoto of the Japan Kaizo-sha Returns to Japan Today</h3>
<p>Yamamoto Sanetohiko, president of the Japan Kaizo-sha, came to China this time for sightseeing and visited leaders from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai to discuss the fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that he visited President Kong of the Central Bank with Mr. Matsumoto Shigeharu, president of the Shanghai Allied News Agency, the day before yesterday, and had a pleasant conversation. Kong specially hosted a banquet for Yamamoto, who is known as an independent and liberal commentator, and has a deep understanding of the stability and consolidation of the political foundation and the efforts to promote economic construction of the new China. He also wrote an inscription for the Kaizo magazine to encourage the Japanese authorities and civil leaders to eliminate the major obstacles to Sino-Japanese friendship. It is heard that Yamamoto has scheduled to return to Japan on the afternoon of the 20th (today) on the Haruna Maru. The following is a farewell poem from Shou Yicheng to Yamamoto: The Book of Changes says, "When a gentleman dwells in his chamber and his words are good, they are responded to from a thousand miles away, how much more so those who are near." It also says, "That which stirs the world is preserved in words, transformation and wealth are preserved in change, and promotion and action are preserved in communication." President Yamamoto, with the authority of the press, is planning the fundamental adjustment of the national relations between China and Japan. His enthusiasm and insight are deeply admired. Now, as we cherish the farewell, I write a few lines to leave a lasting impression. Written on January 19, 26th year of the Republic of China, Yicheng Duo Jingwei respectfully.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Corporation's Business Report for Last Year</h3>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is a Sino-German joint venture with a current capital of 9 million yuan. Its scheduled routes total over 4,600 kilometers. The total flight mileage for last year was over 910,000 kilometers. The number of passengers, calculated up to the end of November, reached over 5,000, an increase of approximately 40% compared to 1935. This surge in business is attributed to the company's widespread adoption of large aircraft, which have provided stable and fast flights. The company released its business report for last year yesterday, and excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Business Overview: The Ministry of Communications, with the aim of realizing air transport between Europe and Asia, entered into the Eurasia Airmail Contract with Deutsche Lufthansa A.G. in 1930. The Ministry of Communications invested 2 million yuan (now increased to 6 million yuan), and Lufthansa invested 1 million yuan (now increased to 3 million yuan) to establish the Eurasia Aviation Corporation in accordance with the laws of the Republic of China. The purpose was to prepare for an air route from Shanghai to Berlin. The implementation plan was to start with domestic routes within China, starting from Shanghai and gradually extending to the Sino-Russian border, and then directly to Berlin. The contract originally stipulated the following routes: 1. From Shanghai via Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and Manzhouli, through Asian Russia to Europe. 2. Or from Shanghai via Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, and a Chinese border city other than Kulun, through Asian Russia to Europe. 3. Or from Shanghai via Nanjing, Gansu, and the Chinese border of Xinjiang, through Asian Russia to Europe. The company was established in February 1931. After considerable active preparation, regular flights began in May of the same year on the first route mentioned above, between Shanghai and Manzhouli. Unfortunately, before April could be completed, the operations were interrupted by the Manchurian Incident. After the Manchurian Incident, the company immediately engaged in the operation of the third route. This route was characterized by interlocking mountains, vast deserts, harsh climate, and sparsely populated areas. The construction of airfields, the building of houses, and the organization of telecommunications, transportation, oil storage, and the replacement of machine parts were extremely difficult. However, regular flights on the 2,000-kilometer section from Shanghai to Lanzhou began in April 1932. By June 1933, the route had officially reached Dihua. Unfortunately, from September of the same year, the section from Lanzhou to Dihua was interrupted again due to international political obstacles within Xinjiang. After encountering two international obstacles, the company actively engaged in the development of domestic routes on one hand to make adjustments and quietly await the change in the political situation in Xinjiang. On the other hand, it sought other routes to reach Europe via the southwestern border of China through southern Asia. However, for three years, the resumption of flights in Xinjiang remained temporarily impossible, and the passage through southern Asia was also in the research stage due to the complexity of the international situation and could not be realized immediately. Therefore, the company's current operations are still temporarily focused on domestic routes.</p>
<p>Current Status of Routes: Although the company's international routes have not yet been opened, the domestic routes operated in China over the past five or six years have seen considerable development. Except for the Shanghai-Xinjiang route from Shanghai to the Russian border, which could only continue to operate to Lanzhou from October 1933 due to the inability to pass through Xinjiang, the Ping-Yue (Beiping to Guangzhou) route was added in May 1934, the Lan-Bao (Lanzhou to Baotou) route was completed in November of the same year, and the Shan-Rong (Shaanxi to Chengdu) route was opened in September 1935. All the above routes have continued to operate without interruption. However, the Ping-Yue route only operated the section from Beiping to Zhengzhou from July 1935. At the end of 1935, the Ministry of Communications ordered the company to plan and operate the Jing-Dian (Nanjing to Yunnan) route, with the aim of reaching Kunming. As a result of the test flights in February of this year, it was decided to extend the Shan-Rong route to Kunming, and it officially opened to traffic on April 1 of last year, designated as the Shaan-Dian route. After the Xi'an Incident, Xi'an and Lanzhou were temporarily unable to operate. From December 15, 1936, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Communications, before the Shaanxi issue was completely resolved, the company's routes, except for Xi'an and Lanzhou, continued to operate as usual, and Taiyuan was added as a stop.</p>
<p>Equipment Improvements: 1. The company constantly improved and expanded the airfields. In addition to installing lighting equipment at Shanghai Airport for safe night flights, a huge aircraft hangar was built at Shanghai Longhua Airport, which was completed in June of last year, costing a total of 150,000 yuan. The hangar can simultaneously store three large aircraft and is equipped with a repair shop, telecommunications room, staff offices, and exquisitely decorated reception rooms. Its meticulous design, beautiful layout, and grand exterior are unparalleled in the Far East. Moreover, the company's routes mostly traveled to the northwestern frontier, where the journeys are long and difficult, and land transportation is extremely challenging. Without detailed planning in advance, it would be difficult for the company's business to develop. Fuel is the most important factor. Therefore, for flight safety, the company spent a lot of money to build three huge underground oil tanks in Xi'an, each with a capacity of 50 tons. According to the current fuel consumption of all aircraft, the oil stored in Xi'an alone is sufficient for five months. Therefore, the company has no fear of running out of fuel on the northwestern route. 2. Telecommunications equipment: Before 1936, both aircraft and land were equipped with long-wave radios, as long waves are more stable and accurate than short waves. However, the range of long waves is not as far as short waves, and they are easily disturbed by static electricity. Most of the company's routes are in the northwest, where the climate is very harsh, and the distance between stations is very long. For flight safety, short-wave radios were added to both aircraft and land stations. In this way, the advantages of both long and short waves can be fully utilized, and the disadvantages can be eliminated. In addition, four meteorological radio stations were added between Chengdu and Kunming, and between Xi'an and Lanzhou. Therefore, last year, no flights were delayed due to weather obstacles. As of the end of last year, the company had the following radio stations: 1. Shanghai 2. Nanjing 3. Zhengzhou 4. Guanyintang 5. Xi'an 6. Fengxiang 7. Hanzhong 8. Lanzhou 9. Jingning 10. Suzhou 11. Anxi 12. Ningxia 13. Baotou 14. Chengdu 15. Yibin 16. Guanghan 17. Guangyuan 18. Kunming 19. Xuanwei 20. Beiping 21. Hankou 22. Taiyuan. Furthermore, large aircraft are equipped with a homing beacon (i.e., the aircraft can independently determine its destination), which is faster and more accurate than ground-based radio direction finding (i.e., the ground-based radio direction finding station determines the direction and informs the aircraft). The device can use local broadcasts and radio stations for direction finding. The direction finding method uses hearing or vision to distinguish direction and only requires a simple switch, so it is extremely fast and convenient. 3. The aircraft used by the company at the beginning of its operations in 1931 were only Junkers F13 and W33. By March 1933, when the Shanghai-Xinjiang route was fully opened, the Junkers W34 began to be used on the western section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route to adapt to the terrain and climate of the northwest. However, the above aircraft were not very large, and the passenger and cargo capacity was limited, and the equipment was not perfect. The company, in view of the increase in business and the increase in passengers and cargo each month, and the gradual extension and expansion of the routes, successively added several Junkers Ju52 large aircraft, which were deployed on various routes. By the end of last year, all of the company's routes were flown entirely by large aircraft.</p>
<p>Business Overview: In order to enhance the confidence of general passengers in air travel and the development of business, the company entered into a contract with Allianz und Stuttgarter Verein Versicherungs A.G. of Germany to establish accident insurance for ordinary air passengers. This insurance covers all passengers, whether paying, free, or discounted. The main compensation conditions are: A. Death: 10,000 yuan, Chinese legal tender; B. Total disability: 10,000 yuan; C. If injured and completely unable to work for a short period of time, a maximum of 10 yuan per day will be paid for recuperation. This insurance is completely handled by the company on behalf of the passengers free of charge, and passengers do not have to pay any insurance premiums in addition to the standard fare, and can enjoy the right to this accident compensation. This system is still a pioneering concept in our country and is a unique advantage of the company. 2. The company's most important mission is to facilitate air transport between Europe and Asia. However, it is regrettable that it has not been fully unblocked due to special circumstances. The domestic routes currently operated by the company are all in the border areas of China, which are relatively backward in culture and commerce, mostly plateau mountainous areas or desert areas, with extremely harsh terrain and climate. The company has been operating here for five or six years, and it has been able to achieve continuous progress in its business. The cargo figures have shown a significant and steady increase in each year, especially the rate of increase this year, which is more significant than in previous years. A table is listed below for comparison:</p>
<p>The figures marked with × only include statistics up to November 1936. The figures for December were not included due to the urgency of time.</p>
<p>Future Plans: The company's future business development, in addition to restoring the Ping-Yue route in the short term, will also strive to realize international airmail. The Ping-Yue route currently only operates between Beiping and Zhengzhou. With the full opening of the Yuehan Railway last year, the development of passenger and cargo transportation can be expected in the future. Therefore, the company plans to extend the route from Zhengzhou to Hankou first, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for approval. Once approved and the plan is ready, it can be realized in the shortest time. The Shanghai-Xinjiang route can reach the Russian border, and the journey from Shanghai to Berlin, Germany, will only take a maximum of five days. This can be proved by the fact that the company's three Junkers W34 flew from Berlin to Shanghai three times in September 1933. If another route is taken from Shanghai via Myanmar and India to Berlin, it will only take seven or eight days. This can be proved by the fact that the Ju52 large aircraft came to Shanghai several times in September 1934 and August-September 1935. The company hopes to live up to the expectations of the society and people at home and abroad, and will continue to work hard to seek the resumption of the full Shanghai-Xinjiang route, so as to promote the realization of international airmail transport arriving in five days between Europe and Asia. However, the situation in Xinjiang is special, and it is difficult to realize it in the short term. However, the company also intends to use Shanghai-Yunnan as a basis to seek the possibility of a route directly from Kunming to Myanmar and India to reach the European continent. This still depends on the support of the government authorities and the cooperation of the public, so as to promote it.</p>

<h3>Thief Held Up with Fake Gun, Captured with Four Gunshot Wounds</h3>
<p>Chinese Constable Hit by Stray Bullet on Forehead</p>
<p>Xie Deyan, an employee of the Bank of China, residing at No. 25 Baden Terrace, Tongfu Road, was suddenly approached by a robber, Tao Boliang (also known as Ah Bao, 44 years old, from Shaoxing), alone at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday. Tao broke into Xie's house through the back door, pulled out a pistol (it was found that the gun was fake, except for the iron pipe as the muzzle, the rest was made of black-coated glutinous rice flour), and threatened the maid to be quiet, watching her in the kitchen. Since Tao was alone, he abandoned the maid and went upstairs to rob. The maid, seeing the robber go upstairs, went out to report to the Sikh constable, who relayed the message to the Chengdu Road Police Station, and also called No. 3026 Chinese constable. Unexpectedly, Tao, having robbed 26 yuan in small change and carrying a fake handgun, was escaping from the back door. The constable took preemptive action, drew his pistol, fired one shot, and hit Tao's leg, causing him to fall to the ground. Just as the Chinese constable was about to arrest him, constables No. 2452, No. 2242, and No. 3082 from the Xinzha Police Station arrived, each raising their pistols and firing seven or eight shots. As a result, Tao was shot four times in both legs, and Chinese constable No. 3026 was also hit in the forehead by a stray bullet. At that time, Chinese detective Feng Baishun and detectives Xia Shikui and Ting Yutang, dispatched by the police station, also arrived, and took the injured Chinese constable and Tao in a car to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. They also investigated the scene of the incident, seized a fake handgun, stolen goods of 26 yuan in small change, four bullets, and seven shell casings, and brought them to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, Tao Boliang was in the hospital due to his injuries, so only the case file and evidence were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit according to Article 328 of the Criminal Law, and stated the above circumstances, requesting a postponement. The judge changed the date, postponing the hearing for 14 days until the defendant recovers from his injuries.</p>
<h3>Ye Kaixin Sues Du Yufei</h3>
<p>Jointly Operated Women's Physical Education School - Recovering Overdue Payments</p>
<p>Ye Kaixin, styled Jingqiu, a historical figure in the history of the Republic of China and a strong general of the Hunan Army, although holding the position of General Counselor of the Military Senate after being relieved of his duties as the commander of the 44th Army, it was a leisure position. During the heyday of law colleges in Shanghai where he once stayed as a recluse, Ye, in response to the trend of the times, founded Jiangnan College at the Jin Situ Temple on Kangnuo Road in western Shanghai, and served as the chairman of the board of directors. Guo Wei, a Shanghai lawyer, once served as the president of the college. It had not been open for three years when it was ordered to close by the Ministry due to poor enrollment and performance. Ye then jointly operated the China Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School with Du Yufei. Now Ye Kaixin has entrusted his outstanding Jiangnan graduate, lawyer Wang Liwu, to sue Du Yufei in the local court to recover: (1) 26,843 yuan in overdue payments, plus interest at 1.5% per month from June 1, 1935, until the date of execution; (2) Confirmation of liability for compensation for damages; (3) An order to hand over the accounts of the China Women's Physical Education Special School under his management for liquidation. The facts stated in the complaint state that Du Yufei entered into a contract with the plaintiff on March 4, 1935, to jointly operate the China Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School, using the buildings and all movable property (including equipment and books) built on the leased land of Jiangnan College as advertised, valued at 80,000 yuan. Due to the joint operation relationship between the two parties, the defendant should pay the plaintiff 40,000 yuan in national currency. However, because it was not easy for the defendant to raise the money at one time, the defendant and the plaintiff agreed on a method of paying in installments. Unexpectedly, the defendant only paid the plaintiff 13,157 yuan successively. Thereafter, all agreements were breached. A total of 26,843 yuan is still owed to the plaintiff, which has not been paid off. Repeated demands have been made, but with repeated delays, hence the lawsuit for the above requests. Judge Yuan opened the court yesterday morning. Ye Kaixin was absent, and the attorney appeared on his behalf, stating that the plaintiff was 49 years old and from Hunan, residing at No. 4 Taiping Bridge, Nanjing, and stated the circumstances of the lawsuit. The defendant was also absent, and was represented by lawyer Cai Xiaobai, who stated in court that the China Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School could not be opened because the term "specialty" (專門) did not comply with the regulations and was rejected. Therefore, there was no partnership nature, and there was no compensation to be made and no facts of payment owed. Because it could not be opened, the defendant hung up the old sign of the China Women's Physical Education School, which he had run for 20 or 30 years. Therefore, there was no relationship with the plaintiff whatsoever, and could only be considered a school building sub-leasing relationship. Moreover, Ye owed money to the construction company for building Jiangnan College, which has already been judged. Lawyer Wu Kaisheng sent a letter notifying that if there was a debt, payments should be stopped. At the same time, the plaintiff mortgaged the school building to the Salt Industry Bank, and also sent a letter notifying the reservation of creditor's rights. Therefore, it is fundamentally impossible to file a lawsuit against the defendant. At this point, the court debate was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Root Brother in Headless Box Corpse Case Completely Reverses Previous Confessions on Appeal</h3>
<p>Everything Stated Previously is Completely False - Closing of Hearing Declared, Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>The Legal Department of the Public Concession Municipal Council, dissatisfied with the acquittal of Lin Gendi (female), Mao Agen, and Jiang Yuanying in the headless box corpse case by the First Special District Court, filed an appeal, which has been investigated in a court session by the Second Branch of the High Court. The circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the High Court, headed by presiding judge Yu Hua, accompanied by judges Nie and Xiao and prosecutor Lin, continued the hearing in the first criminal court. Mao Agen's lawyer and Feng Shuhua, the lawyer appointed by the court to defend Lin Gendi and Jiang Yuanying, appeared in court. First, police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the reasons for the appeal (which have been reported previously and are omitted). Then, Lin Gendi, who had always admitted to killing Caiying with Mao Agen and Jiang Yuanying, suddenly recanted, claiming that his confessions regarding the killing of Caiying were completely false, and that he had been forced to make them due to torture. He did not know Caiying at all, had never met her, and had never been to No. 1 Cunfu Lane. The court immediately asked that since this was not the case, why did he say he had killed someone in front of a trolleybus in front of the cigarette shop on Carter Road before the case was solved. Lin also denied this, and in short, overturned all previous confessions, repeatedly claiming innocence. Mao Agen and Jiang Yuanying still consistently maintained their previous claims, firmly denying everything. Then the court ordered Ye Kuiyu, the head of Cunfu Lane, to be brought to court, who also claimed that there was no Caiying living in house number three in the lane. Presiding judge Yu then ordered the start of the debate. First, police lawyer Gan debated, requesting the original judgment to be set aside and Lin et al. to be punished with the crimes they deserved. Then, lawyer Fan Gang defended Mao Agen, stating briefly that the police's appeal was completely based on Lin Gendi's confession. Now that Lin has completely reversed his previous confession, their appeal has no basis at all. Even based on Lin's previous confession, it does not correspond with the facts, such as the contradiction between the dates, and the claim that when he went to kill Caiying, he saw Caiying covered with a quilt lying on the bed. How could anyone be covered with a quilt in ninety-degree weather? Moreover, the investigation of household registration in the Chinese area is very strict. How could anyone dare to sublet a house privately? Furthermore, the appellants all claimed that the confessions were obtained through torture. Therefore, the appellant's appeal has no reason and should be dismissed. Finally, lawyer Feng debated briefly. Presiding judge Yu then declared the hearing closed and scheduled the judgment to be announced at 2 PM on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain Causes Car Collision</h3>
<p>Driver Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 1:40, a service car with license plate number 12524, driven by car driver Zhu Wanzhang (21 years old, from Ningbo) of the World Automobile Company at 397 Edward Road, was traveling south on Gordon Road near the intersection of Connaught Road in western Shanghai when it collided with a public bus with license plate number 15138 (carrying workers returning from Yangshupu), driven by Xu Jinshou, 36 years old, from Tongzhou, traveling west. Due to the heavy rain, it was difficult to distinguish clearly, resulting in the collision of the two cars. As a result, the service car of the World Company was damaged, with the front glass water tank mudguard broken, and the car driver Zhu Wanzhang had a broken left chest bone, a very serious injury. The public bus driver Xu Jinshou also suffered abrasions to his left arm. After the accident, Chinese constable No. 2309 from the Gordon Road Police Station arrived and took both injured parties to Shijiang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Requesting No Increase in Taxes</p>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in response to a letter from the City Federation stating that the Municipal Council is considering increasing taxes, sends a special letter to stop it. Dear Sir, we received a letter from the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, stating that the executive committee members Liu Zhongying, Ge Futian, and Gu Yucang have jointly written a letter stating that, having read in the newspaper that the Public Concession authorities are planning to increase the municipal tax by 2% from this year onwards to supplement funds, they are extremely shocked. They state that, affected by the economic downturn in recent years, the market has declined to its extreme. Industrial, commercial, and residential households are already feeling overwhelmed by the existing rents and taxes. If they are to be subjected to more heavy taxation, they will be driven to the brink of ruin, and the future will be unbearable. The social security will also be adversely affected. We cannot remain silent. We request your association to consider the suffering of the taxpayers at this time when the Municipal Council is undecided, argue reasonably, negotiate to stop it, etc. This has been submitted to the fourteenth executive committee meeting for discussion, and it was unanimously agreed that, given the current economic downturn, if the concession authorities were to have this plan, this policy of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs would inevitably make the economic situation of the citizens more difficult, and the various industrial and commercial sectors would fall into an unimaginable state. The concession authorities should pay close attention. We hereby send a special letter requesting your association to consider the difficulties of the times, forward a letter to the Municipal Council to fundamentally revoke the proposed tax increase. The citizens would be fortunate, and the industry and commerce would be fortunate. Due to the meeting, the market situation and the social economic capacity, those with some common sense should be able to know it, without waiting for an explanation to your bureau. Moreover, in order to cope with this very tight period, we should request your bureau to pay attention to the frugality suggestions of our association years ago, and actively adopt them, especially to completely eliminate the "outdated" exchange rate subsidies, so that 1.7 million yuan can be saved in a year. Please do not continue to use irresponsible remarks such as "an extra yuan is added to a 100-yuan rent, and four yuan is added to a 200-yuan rent" (the North-China Daily News printed it as five yuan) to "be generous at the expense of others," and cause public panic. This is addressed to Mr. Fei, the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reply letter to the City Federation says: In reply to your letter of January 12, regarding the proposed tax increase by the Public Concession Municipal Council. Upon investigation, Chief Director An Nuode has often spoken about this issue, and it is not the first time. However, this year it is more concrete, saying "only two yuan will be added per month for a rent of one hundred yuan, and four yuan will be added for two hundred yuan" (the North-China Daily News reported it as five yuan, it is unknown who is wrong.) In addition to this, there are no concrete proposals. It is thought that the directors of the bureau are not as diligent as us, otherwise, the fable of King Atum would have been completely forgotten. In addition to a special letter to the bureau, please find enclosed for your information. This is addressed to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Introduces Domestic Export Products</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from Mr. J. L. Lipson of New York, USA, which says: Dear Sir, I have extensive research on botanical medicinal materials. I would like to know the names and addresses of Chinese and foreign firms in your country that specialize in importing ginseng. I can open and send official prices and possibly contact importers in your country for everything, which is what I hope for. At the same time, I am also engaged in the import business, and I am very willing to represent Chinese merchants in my country to operate the import of various goods, which I am most interested in. I work as an agent for customers on a commission basis, and I am very willing to accept commissions from first-class firms in your country. Respectfully, the goods he listed include various volatile oil spices and spice seed plant medicinal materials. Also, the Dutch shipping company Hai Chang Foreign Company also sent a letter introducing ephedra and other items. If there are import and export firms for the above-mentioned goods, please send personnel to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Business Section immediately for face-to-face consultation.</p>

<h3>County-Wide Re-Investigation of Opium Addiction Reveals Fifty-Seven Offenders</h3>
<p>Chenghuang Temple to be Used as Temporary Detention Center</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government attaches great importance to the thorough eradication of opium addiction in this county-wide re-investigation of opium, and therefore, is handling the situation with severity. Since its implementation this month, the Anti-Opium Section Chief Shen Jiaqi, together with Public Safety Bureau Chief Yin Xiongfei, have been traveling to various townships in the first, second, and third districts of Puxi to conduct house-to-house re-investigations. A total of fifty-seven opium addicts have been apprehended, and those who privately sell and smoke opium have not been spared. Furthermore, starting yesterday, investigations were conducted in the fourth and fifth districts of Pudong. From the 18th, a county-wide mobilization for re-investigation will commence. On the other hand, County Magistrate Li Zhifu has noted that the number of opium addicts detained is steadily increasing. Since the county has no prison, and the detention center is extremely small, in addition to requesting the Songjiang Third District Special Office to approve a location for accommodating convicted criminals, and expanding the detention center, it is planned to use the Chenghuang Temple as a temporary detention facility.</p>
<h3>Special Price for Jointly Transported Coarse Paper on Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Extended for One Year</h3>

After consultation with the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, and Beining railways, it was agreed to continue the extension for one year. The report requested instructions and ordered all related railways to comply. The association's statement was deemed feasible, and the order approved the continuation of the extension for one year from January 1, 1937, and instructed the railway to comply.</p>

<h3>General Strike by All Workers at Ruirong Factory Yesterday, Then Work Resumed</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the British-owned Ruirong Shipyard on Yangshupu Road in Eastern Shanghai has two factories, new and old, employing a total of over 700 workers, and is organized as the Fourth District Shipbuilding Workers Union. In the past, the union had agreements with the factory regarding labor and compensation conditions, which had been in place for many years. Recently, due to the factory's announcement of reorganization in 1935, the factory sent a letter to the union on December 18 of last year declaring the cancellation of the signed labor conditions. Upon hearing the news, all the workers panicked and the union negotiated several times but without result. Therefore, at around 7:00 AM yesterday, all the workers entered the factory, but except for a small number of junior workers who continued to work as usual, the remaining 500 or more workers declared a joint strike to urge the factory to understand. The order was very good and they waited for the authorities to mediate according to the law.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation: The labor side sent representatives to the Party and government agencies and the General Labor Union to petition for assistance. After receiving the report, the authorities sent Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, together with a translator, to the factory to mediate. The Associate Manager of the British United Shipyards, Ai Mu, received them. As a result of the mediation, it was decided that: (1) Regarding the new compensation conditions set by the factory, the Associate Manager will be responsible for urging the board of directors to respond within two weeks. (2) After the labor conditions are drafted, they will be submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau for review and publication in accordance with Chinese factory regulations. (3) Before the new conditions are published, regarding the workers' work, the previously determined 15 days of work per month will now be changed to 12 days of work out of every 28 days by the Associate Manager.</p>
<p>Persuading Resumption of Work: After the representatives of the Party and government agencies reached a mediation decision, they convened all the workers in the open space of the factory to speak and report on the content of the mediation, persuading the workers to immediately resume work. The workers of the factory, to show their compliance with the orders of the superior authorities, expressed their absolute support for the decisions. At around 10:00 AM, they all entered the factory and resumed work. The order was very good.</p>
<h3>Sanxing Tobacco Factory Ceases Operations and Dissolves, Workers Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Sanxing Tobacco Company, located at 71 Yulin Road, convened a shareholders' meeting on the 16th of this month. Due to a lack of working capital and severe difficulties in business, it was resolved to dissolve the company for liquidation and to appoint accountant Xu Yongqi and lawyer Tang Ming as liquidators. Upon hearing the news, all 400 or more workers panicked. At 2:00 PM yesterday, they sent Shao Acai and others to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, stating their opinions and requesting that the dissolution of the company be prevented to avoid the unemployment of hundreds of workers. The mediator of the Third Section, Zhu Guilin, received them and promised to forward the petition to the director for review. They then went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to make a similar petition. Zhang Sheng, the General Manager of the Civil Affairs Section, received them and promised to handle it together with the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Boatman Dies from Coal Gas Poisoning</h3>
<p>Yan Atong, a 43-year-old native of Pudong, had been working as a second mate on the Shuntai Company's No. 10 iron barge. The night before last, the boat was docked at Qichang Stack pier in Yongdong for the night. Yan burned coal briquettes for warmth because of the cold weather and fell asleep. The next morning, he was discovered by someone to have been poisoned by coal gas and was unconscious. Shanhaiguan Water Patrol Police Hua Detective Shen Changshan rushed him to Yangshupu Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but he died at 2:00 PM. Yesterday morning, the body was sent to the Salvation Bureau for the coroner to determine the cause of death, and his wife, Jin, was ordered to collect the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Worker Chops Foreman Due to Debt Dispute</h3>
<p>Ji Erbao, a 47-year-old native of Nantong, resided at 70 Chengping Lane, Linping Road, north of Xinchan. He worked as a foreman at the Rihua Paint Company. Recently, he had a debt dispute with worker Shen Shan Hong (a 30-year-old native of Nantong residing in Dongjiazhai). Shen harbored a grudge and lured Ji to a rural area in Dongjiazhai at around 7:00 PM last night, where he used a pre-prepared ax to violently chop Ji's head twice. The skull was fractured about three inches, and blood flowed profusely. Ji fell to the ground in pain, and Shen abandoned the ax and fled. After the incident, someone discovered it and reported it to the police, who rushed Ji to the hospital for treatment. The fugitive suspect Shen Shan Hong is currently being actively pursued.</p>
<h3>Key Defendant in Shao Wenbin Case Accuses Western Detective of Dereliction of Duty and Bribery</h3>
<p>And Also Letting Go of Key Defendants in the Case - Interrogation Ordered Yesterday Pending Investigation</p>
<p>Zhang Bingrong, a native of Ningbo (aged 35, nicknamed "Little Ningbo"), the murderer in the case of the assassination of Hua Hui King Shao Wenbin on Wagao Road in the French Concession on the night of July 28, 1933, was arrested by the French police and sent to court for prosecution. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and is currently serving his sentence in the Second Prison under the jurisdiction of Beixinjing. Recently, the French police arrested two key defendants in the case, Wang Shilong and Qian A Jin, and brought them to Zhang for questioning. Due to Wang and Qian's dissatisfaction with the verdict and their appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court, Zhang was required to testify and has not yet been sent back, and is temporarily detained in the Second Special District Prison. Now, Zhang has filed a petition with the Second Special Court Criminal Division, accusing the Twelfth Western Detective of the French Police Department of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes, letting go of the key defendant Chen Shuang'er, and requesting an investigation and arrest. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Criminal Court ordered Zhang to be brought in for questioning. Zhang claimed that he did not participate in the killing of Shao Wenbin and was wrongly convicted. This time, because Wang Shilong was arrested, the French police came to bring me to testify. On November 3, I was brought to the police station, but was not interrogated. It was not until the 21st that I was brought out. The Twelfth Western Detective beat me twice without asking the reason, causing me to be injured and vomit blood. I felt very unwilling. I also reported the address of Chen Shuang'er, a person related to the murder case, and asked them to arrest him, but they delayed the arrest, allowing Chen to escape. I request an investigation to seek justice. I asked if the Western Detective who beat you was French or Russian. He replied that he said two sentences to me in Chinese and was probably French. The court ordered an investigation and review, and ordered Zhang to be sent to the forensic doctor for treatment before being sent back to prison. It was also announced that if it was found that a Frenchman had beaten you, you could not sue here and should file a lawsuit with the French Consulate. The court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Two Defendants in Tang Youren Assassination Case Still Confess to Murder</h3>
<p>Tang's Sister, Meishu, Did Not Appear Yesterday - Court Ordered Rescheduled Hearing on the 26th</p>
<p>Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, was shot and killed by assassins in front of his private residence in Gancun, Gansidong Road in the French Concession of this city on the evening of December 25, 1935. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Police successively arrested Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu, the perpetrators who carried out the shooting. The French Police Department transferred them to the court for interrogation and detention for a month before completing the investigation. The Police Department's lawyer filed a public prosecution against the two defendants based on Article 271, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law for the crime of murder. The case was repeatedly heard by Wang Gangxu, the former presiding judge of the Second Special Court Criminal Division. The two defendants admitted to the killing of Tang with their accomplices who were still at large, but because the case still needed investigation, witnesses needed to be summoned for questioning, and defense lawyers needed to be appointed, the hearing was adjourned to a later date. This matter has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Another Hearing Was Scheduled: Presiding Judge Chen Daqi of the First Criminal Court ordered Liu and Qiu to be brought to the case. After questioning their ages and hometowns, he declared a renewed hearing. First, Fei Xizhen, the lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case and the articles of the indictment. Then, the detectives reported on the investigation process of arresting the defendants. When questioned, Liu and Qiu still confessed to the shooting and killing of Tang Youren. Then, the witness Zheng Ma, the maid employed by the Tang family, testified, "That day, I was playing with the four-year-old young master on the fourth floor when I suddenly heard</p>
<p>Gunshots Outside: I didn't pay attention until I heard crying downstairs. I went downstairs to the second floor and saw the master (referring to Tang Youren) collapsed inside the door, barely breathing and unable to speak. I didn't see what was happening outside," and so on. Detective Zuo Qihong reported that Tang's sister, Tang Meishu, did not plan to appear in court to testify today because she was unable to come. After reviewing the situation, the court ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the 26th, and the two defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Another Accomplice in Jingyun Building Robbery Arrested</h3>
<p>Discovered During Handgun Inspection - The Robbers Have Committed Many Other Robberies</p>
<p>During the morning of last New Year's Eve, Liu Jingde's office in the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road was broken into and robbed, resulting in a tragic struggle to capture the robbers. Subsequently, after investigations by Chinese and Western detectives from the patrol police station, Wang Jinsheng, Deng Shaoch臣, Yu Fengsen, and eighteen others related to the case were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for detention. The details were reported in this newspaper. Previously, detective of the Chengdu Road police station, Shan Zhaoxian and Wang Buchang, learned that several bandits were planning to commit crimes in the area of the Huishi police station, but</p>
<p>They Must Pass Through: The intersection of Longmen Road and Race Course Road. They went to wait and at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, as expected, the bandits Chen Rongsheng (also known as Xiaojiangbei, Ye A Da, Ye Baozi), a native of Jiangbei, Chen Lianjin, a native of Shandong, and An Ziwen, came. They rushed forward and arrested Chen and the other three, found a gun and three bullets on Chen, and took them back to the police station. Hua Detective Chief Shang Wu of the Huishi police station also arrested a Jiangbei native, Han Xiaolong. Han has</p>
<p>Special Influence: In the Hongkou area, with many followers, specializing in supplying arms to bandits, and has been imprisoned many times. He was recently released last month for the same offense. The Chengdu Road police station sent the seized gun to the Firearms Inspection Office for inspection, and it was discovered that the gun was the one used to resist arrest during the Jingyun Building case. Because the Jingyun Building case has been accepted by the patrol police station, the two Chens, An, and Han</p>
<p>Were Sent Together: To the Central Police Station. Chief Detective Zhang Mingde, Detectives Jiang Shangpei, Wu Yaozu, and others investigated. Wang Jinsheng, who had already been arrested, identified Chen Rongsheng as the one who went to the Jingyun Building to rob and resist arrest at the time. They were immediately arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the process, saying that the defendants in this case, in addition to the Jingyun Building case, had also committed</p>
<p>Many Other Robberies: And the investigation was quite difficult. Therefore, he requested a postponement to investigate and interrogate them together with Wang Jinsheng and others. When questioned, Chen Rongsheng only admitted to the names Ye A Da and Xiaojiangbei, and denied having the names Chen Rongsheng and Ye Baozi. After Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession, he ordered all of them to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing to be held together with Wang Jinsheng and others. Also, the women Lu Xu Xiuzhen and Xu Honglin, who were arrested at 8 Xiaopi Road in Nanshi, were found by the police to be unrelated, so yesterday morning, lawyer Ru Baoyi asked the First Special Court to stop the detention, and Judge Feng approved, ordering the release of Ms. Lu and Xu.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Opium Smokers Should Be Sent to the Garrison Command</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu began handling anti-drug matters on January 1 of this year, it has been quite serious. Anyone involved in the manufacturing, trafficking, or smoking of potent drugs will be punished according to the anti-drug regulations without any leniency, so that those addicted to these drugs are afraid to try them for fear of punishment. Recently, he again instructed the Municipal Police Bureau that all opium smokers arrested by the various sub-bureaus without licenses, regardless of whether they are smoking, should be sent to the headquarters for interrogation and punishment and should not be disposed of without authorization. It is said that Director Cai has already notified the responsible departments and various sub-bureaus to comply.</p>
<h3>Candle Industry Announces to the Trade</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association stated that since Yuanfengrun Lin Ji was giving away gifts, and advice based on industry rules was ineffective, the association, in addition to petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance, also announced to the trade for self-encouragement. The declaration stated, "The candle industry has been declining for years and has reached its limit. Although this is due to the economic downturn, the huge sacrifices caused by giveaways between each other are also a major reason. Last year, to seek a remedy, the entire industry agreed to abolish giveaways, and at the same time, the union jointly provided practical assistance. The outline of the agreement was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau in October and repeatedly published in newspapers and sent to everyone for compliance. Since the rectification, considerable results have been seen, and everyone said that the industry's turnaround is promising. On January 6, Dongxinqiao Yuanfengrun Lin Ji Candle Shop opened, and it was rumored beforehand that the shop had giveaways prepared. Representatives were immediately sent to send a letter to politely stop them, but it was not satisfactory. Yin Sheng and others felt that their sincerity was not trusted, and sent letters separately to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu Qiaqing to find ways to mediate. Who knew that the shopkeeper agreed to change the ten days of giveaways to three days, but the person in charge of the shop continued to give away gifts, causing neighboring businesses, who Yin Sheng and others had tried their best to dissuade from starting competition, to be unbearable. However, Yin Sheng and others still considered the entire industry, and proceeded patiently without slacking off, asking the government and begging well-known people. Everything that could be done to avert this imminent crisis was done wholeheartedly. But as of last night, hope was exhausted, industry rules lost their effectiveness, the agreement was equivalent to a blank sheet of paper, and the corruption was imminent. Although Yin Sheng and others are foolish merchants, the reason why they reluctantly supported it was that they thought the laws and regulations were enough to follow. If this is the case, how can they continue to procrastinate? Moreover, eliminating annual customs is the key to the industry's annual business, and time is of the essence today. Yin Sheng and others cannot afford to delay any longer. Therefore, this announcement is made to state the process. All of our industry, in this environment, has no choice but to adapt to changes and seek survival. Alas, years of effort have been wasted in one day, and the five inner organs are devastated, what more can be said? But as long as there is a breath, we will continue to proceed. We hope for your understanding. Yin Sheng and other members of the Shanghai Candle Industry Association pay their respects."</p>

<p>自從 民元 以來，貿易 入 超•一年 增加 一年，目前 入 超額，已達 每年 數萬 萬元 之 鉅；若 長此以往，則 再 隔 一 二十 年 後，入 超額 將 增加 至 百萬 萬 或 千萬 萬 的 數目，試想 我們 中國，有 多大的 財力，能 負起 這樣 重 漏 巵 的 擔負 呢？那時 中國，卽 使 不 被 人 用 武力 併吞，也 勢必 生 貧血症 而 自 亡。所以 現在 國內 有識之士，都 感覺到 提倡 國貨 實 是 救國 圖 存 基本 的 要務，但是 提倡 國貨，話可 很 容易 講，而 事實上 卻 很 難 實行，大 原因 是 因為 外貨 在 華 勢力 的 龐大，和 大多數 民衆 對於 國貨 缺乏 信 抑 的 緣故，所以 我們 要 提倡 國貨，必 先 把 障礙 國貨 發達 的 病源 去掉，就是 說 ㊀ 要 縮小 或 至 絕滅 外貨 在 華 勢力，㊁ 要 使 民衆 對於 國貨 生 信仰 心。至於 要 講到 怎樣 縮小 外貨 勢力，這是 政府 的 事，姑且 撇開 不談，我們 要 研究 的 是 怎樣 使 民衆 對於 國貨 生 信仰 心？以 作者 的 意思，應 照 下列 兩法 進行；茲 分別 寫在 後面，以 供 國貨 界 同人 的 參考。</p>
<p>一 積極 宣傳：在 現代 工商業 競爭 中，宣傳 是 佔有 很 重要 的 地位，國貨 要 和 外貨 競爭，也 自然 要 借重 宣傳 的 力量，宣傳 的 功用 可 使 民衆 對於 國貨 多 一層 認識，誘導 民衆 走上 對於 國貨 生 信仰 的 途徑，宣傳 的 方法 可分：㊀ 時常 舉行 國貨 展覽會；㊁ 發行 大量 刊物 介紹 各種 國貨 和 討論 如何 改善 國貨 等，並 要求 國內 報章 雜誌 對於 國貨 廣告 與 以 優待；㊂ 歡迎 個人 或 團體 至 國貨 廠家 參觀 並 將 有 價值 國貨 製造 情形，攝成 影片，時 往 學校，公園，舟車 等 公共 塲 所 開 映：㊃ 雖在 窮鄉僻巷 之 處，時常 須 派人 携帶 國貨 樣品 去 作 宣傳 等 工作。</p>
<p>二 務求 出品 精良，價格 低廉：若 宣傳 得法，民衆 對於 國貨 更有 想 相當 認識。若 再加 國貨 能 有 優良 的 品質 糧 低廉 的 價格，那麼 民衆 的 信仰 心 自然 發生了，反之 若是 宣傳 很 得法，而 品質 低劣 或 價值 過 昂貴，那麼 非但 民衆 對於 國貨 永遠 不 生 信仰，並且 反而 增加 他們 對於 外貨 的 信仰 力，這是 最 危險 不過 的 了。</p>
<p>總之，我們 要 希望 提倡 國貨，必 先 博得 民衆 的 信仰 心。有了 信仰 心，民衆 便 自然 樂用 國貨 外貨 也 自然 歛跡。國家，社會，民族 的 經濟 前途 方才 有 光明 的 一日。</p>
<h3>勞資 合作 與 國貨 前途</h3>
<p>— 孟 昭</p>
<p>我 記得 王雲五 先生 曾經 演說 過 “勞資 雙方 如 水泥 與 鋼骨，不可 分離 的，雙方 合作，為 事業 而 奮 鬬，前途 繼 有 光明 的 路 的。” 筆者 服務 工廠 七八年 來 觀察 和 體味，覺得 王 先生 的 話 是 金科玉律，一些 不錯 的。可是 近 幾天 來，國貨 工廠，如—華商 紗廠—勞方 忽因 要求 增加 工資，而 接 一連 二 的 發生 罷工 情事，這是 何等 愚昧 的 舉動！誠然：物價 的 騰貴，生活 的 壓迫—在 勞工 立 塲 上 說：出賣 汗血，所得 工資，不足以 維持 高度 的 生活，是 相當 地 艱苦 的，然而 在 資方 立 塲 上 說，歷年 能 在 不景氣 巨浪 裏，掙扎 過來 的，到 現在 獲得 復興 機會，稍稍 抬頭 的，也 不過 失之東隅，未必 能 全 收 桑 楡，僅僅 是 挖肉補瘡 而已！所以在 事實 擺 作 眼前 的 洋貨 侵略 未曾 消滅，洋貨 心理 未曾 打倒 的 時候，勞資 更 其要 步驟 一致 的 團結 起來，不容 分裂！罷工 是 自殺 的 行為，萬萬 不可 輕易 登 生 的，如果 勞方 有 合理 的 環境 上 的 要求，不妨 一面 工作，一面 請願，鎮靜 而 不 暴躁，守 秩序！守 紀律，資方 自然 解衣推食，有 衡情 的 補救 辦法 的，生產 不 間斷，攸關於 國貨 的 光明 前途，是非 淺鮮 的，薛光前 先生，在 復旦大學 演講 “意大利” 民族 的 能夠 復興！原因 是 在 ㊀ 嚴密 的 經濟 組織，㊁ 崇高 的 青年 訓練，關於 第一點，他說 “…… 譬如 紡織 一項，” 內部 可 分為 地質，選種，棉花，紡紗，織部，染料 等。工程師，機器 商，跟 消費者，都 打成 一片，…… 不合 標準 需要 時，他們 都 可 源源本本 的 去 推求 和 改進…… 調和 勞資 一項，在 一九二七年 也 公布 了 勞動 章，規定 工人 不准 罷工，工廠 不得 關閉，一切 糾紛，都 由 公會 調解…… 頓 使 國家 的 經濟 組織 也 鞏固 起來……“（見 十一月 八日 新聞報 茶話 欄）然則 勞資 合作，直接 關乎 國貨 工廠 的 本身，間接 更 關乎 國家 經濟 組織 的 健全，真是 何等 重大 啊！</p>
<h3>Review and Reflection</h3>
<p>— Thin Qiu</p>
<p>— Am I to be considered Chinese? How quickly time passes!</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizen's Use of National Products Year is about to bid farewell to us! As this Citizen's Use of National Products Year draws to a close, every compatriot should review and reflect on the work they have done to promote national products over the past year.</p>
<p>Let's start with the individual. We should think: Did we actually practice promoting and using national products this year? How much foreign goods did we buy this year? Were the foreign goods we bought necessary? Was there no national product that could replace them? If not, are we worthy of our compatriots? Are we worthy of our country? Then, from the individual, think of the family; from the family, think of the country. Conduct a detailed review and reflection on this year's national products movement.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is much to be gratified about in this year's Citizen's Use of National Products Year. Things like the invention of various national products, the improvement of various national products, and the enthusiastic use of national products by patriotic compatriots are all very gratifying to us. But what makes us sad is that the leakage [of money to foreign goods] is still in the hundreds of millions, especially for all kinds of consumables, entertainment products, and cosmetics. Things like shark fins and sea cucumbers, wireless radios, perfumes and powders, cold cream, snow powder, cosmetic jewelry, and tobacco and alcohol all have huge leakages. In the Year of National Products, there is still this phenomenon, which is truly a disgrace to the citizens of the Republic of China! Therefore, I hope that compatriots will carefully reflect on this. I remember that in the Capital's National Products Promotion Movement, there was such a slogan: Chinese people must use Chinese goods! Not using Chinese goods means not being Chinese. So, I dare to ask readers to think about it: Am I Chinese? Fellow compatriots! The national crisis is getting worse every day. Foreign aggression is becoming increasingly urgent. If we do not work practically to promote national products under these severe conditions, but continue to only sing high-sounding tunes, then the future of China can truly be described with the old saying "national demise is imminent"! I would like to request everyone here to make a great determination after reviewing and reflecting, and immediately start promoting national products.</p>
<h3>Visiting Families and Visiting Factories</h3>
<p>— Wang Shu</p>
<p>This year, the Shanghai National Products Movement Joint Association is conducting two very meaningful tasks: One is to send female interviewers to visit housewives in various residential areas, carrying samples, and conducting on-the-spot promotion; the other is to send male interviewers to visit various national product factories to conduct practical investigations into production conditions. These two are of great significance in communicating the voices of both producers and consumers.</p>
<p>However, whether the work of the interviewers can proceed smoothly depends on the assistance of various parties. According to reports on the work of the female interviewers, it is known that a small number of housewives do not understand the meaning of the interview, and therefore there are perfunctory, disgust, refusal, and other obstacles. However, in general, all aspects, especially the opinion of the newspapers, have provided them with a lot of assistance, so their work is much more convenient than those visiting factories. As for the work of male interviewers, although it has not been reported in the newspapers, it is said that the difficulties they feel when visiting factories are even greater than those of the female interviewers. The crux of their problem is that they cannot obtain the understanding of the factory owners. Sometimes they are not allowed to visit smoothly, and even after the visit, they can only get a superficial outline. The factory owners are unwilling to clearly indicate all the actual production and sales conditions and economic situation. For the factory owners, of course, they have their reasons, but it is undeniable that they do not understand the mission of the interviewers, just like a few housewives.</p>
<p>In theory, visiting families and factories is equally important. The former can clarify the intentions of consumers and serve as a reference for improving production, while the latter can know the production situation of the factory and serve as a research on promotion skills and technology. The two complement each other and progress together, and there is no room for bias. However, all parties, especially national product factories that have a direct relationship, have many misunderstandings about the interviewers, and this attitude needs to be corrected. We should enable the work of the interviewers to proceed smoothly, because this is the most practical way to communicate the voices of production and sales.</p>
<h3>The Nanyang Islands and the National Products Market</h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>The Nanyang Islands referred to here only include the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, the Malay Federation, Borneo, Annam, Myanmar, etc. According to recent surveys, there are as many as 6,155,000 overseas Chinese scattered on the various islands. Because most of the overseas Chinese are patriotic and willing to buy goods from their motherland, the Nanyang Islands are indeed a great market for national products. According to China's foreign trade statistics in recent years, exports to the Nanyang Islands are the largest. It can be seen that there is a vast market for national products there, and Chinese national product factories want national products to develop overseas. The first step should be to pay attention to finding ways to promote the sales of national products in the Nanyang Islands.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Nanyang region has attracted close attention from all countries in the world because of its fertile land and dense population, and is regarded as a great market. They try their best to export goods there for promotion. As a result, in the market of the Nanyang Islands, goods from various countries in the East and the West can be seen, and the competition between each other is also very fierce. This shows how important the commercial status of the Nanyang Islands is, and it is something we cannot ignore. Therefore, we hope that under the guidance of the authorities, national product factories can do their best to promote the national product market in Nanyang.</p>
<p>It is said that the annual import and export statistics of the above-mentioned islands reached 2,500,000,000 yuan for imports and 1,500,000,000 yuan for exports during the heyday. Since the entire world began to experience an economic downturn, the import and export statistics in Nanyang in recent years have also ranged from 900,000,000 yuan to 1,200,000,000 yuan. In this figure, China has also accounted for a lot in recent years, especially the national products exported by China, which are increasing year by year. From this, it can be seen that if national product factories can continue to find ways to promote the national product market in Nanyang in the future, then the future will certainly have considerable development.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that in recent years, because the entire world is experiencing an economic downturn, all countries have strongly resisted imported goods. For this reason, China, in European and American countries, can only supply a few raw materials, and all national product exports cannot occupy any position. Therefore, from the current environment, if you want national products to develop overseas, you can only first find a way out in Nanyang and seek development, and then further seek the market of various countries there.</p>
<p>As for the various methods we should adopt to promote the national product market in Nanyang, this is of course also a problem to be studied. In my opinion, in addition to studying the trade system, commodity substance, and strong assistance from bankers in the Nanyang market to enable national product factories to strongly promote sales in Nanyang; seeking contact with overseas Chinese merchants in Nanyang, often holding national product exhibitions overseas, and devoting efforts to various publicity efforts are all extremely important. In particular, it is hoped that the factory sector will select the best national products and transport them to Nanyang. If they are greedy for high profits and mix inferior goods into Nanyang, then the result will be the loss of confidence of overseas Chinese and even the loss of the entire national product market in Nanyang, which is a point that cannot be ignored!</p>
<h3>First-Class National Products</h3>
<p>— Natural</p>
<p>In the past, there was a first-class cabinet, and now there are first-class national products. The so-called "first-class" means that the reputation is well-deserved, the most famous, the most valuable, the most worthy of adoption, and worthy of being in a leading position among general national products. It is not easy to obtain the reputation of being first-class for the same national product and the same product. It must take countless spirit, use countless power, undergo countless studies, and go through countless improvements. The knowledge, technology, and improvement efforts required in this process are unknown. After that, it can enjoy this good reputation, which is not accidental, let alone borrowed. It must be that the reputation is consistent with reality, and that it gains people's belief, then it can live in it without shame and use it without embarrassment. If the industrial sector wants to treat itself as first-class, everyone should encourage and motivate themselves with this, and if all national products can be labeled as first-class in the future, how can we imagine the progress of the national product industry at this time? It is up to people to make things happen, let us encourage each other.</p>

<h3>War</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>War is cruel and tragic.</p>
<p>War will destroy human civilization, destroy all material construction in society, turn lively cities into ruins, turn great buildings into ashes, and even cause the loss of life of thousands upon thousands of men, women, old and young.</p>
<p>However, the current world is being wholly plunged into the brewing of war and infighting, and a strong gunpowder smell has already filled the entire globe.</p>
<p>There are many ambitious people who are already displaying their power, openly or semi-openly slaughtering us weak, but in their mouths, they are singing the tune of "conquering barbarism, spreading civilization, and promoting royalism."</p>
<p>Therefore, we must never forget that only war for the survival of the motherland is the greatest and most glorious war of mankind, and only this war can enable mankind to rebuild the "temple of peace."</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>My house has only a door, no windows, and because I am afraid that the children will break in and make noise, even the door is closed. As for air and light, it is needless to say. Whether it is day or night, I always have to turn on the electric light, and my work and life are solved under the glaring electric light. When I rest, it is in the evening. I stroll on the street and see the sun. Although I feel more relaxed, what is presented in front of my eyes is still a picture of life. It often makes me come back with a depressed heart. One evening, I went out as usual. There were many people surrounding the entrance of a Chinese medicine store, and the children were especially energetic. Suddenly, a bird flew out of the crowd. It just flew to the ridge of the roof, and then flew back into the crowd. Because it went from darkness to a bright place, its eyes were a little dizzy. I couldn't see clearly what the bird was flying up and down. I squeezed up intentionally or unintentionally, and then I understood.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man wearing a melon-skin hat was standing in the crowd. His face was thin and dark, and his face was dull, probably not very proud. The palms of his hands were holding the pair of flying birds. His right hand pinched two bone pellets, and he kept waving his gestures to the bird. He threw a pellet into the air, and the bird swooped to the ground. He then threw the second pellet, and the bird held both pellets and flew back to the middle-aged man's hand and spat them out. Then he took out a few grains of shell from his pocket, and it bowed its head and pecked. Everyone watched with fascination, praising the bird's agility.</p>
<p>But I didn't have the intention to praise. This is a microcosm of life. The bird struggled to fly up and down, being driven by people, for only a few grains of grain. This trick was played four or five times, and the middle-aged man glanced at the crowd and said, "Whoever likes this bird can sell it cheaply. I'm embarrassed to play with it. Otherwise, I won't let it to others after I've practiced it myself. Who wants it, two silver dollars." He held the pair of birds in front of everyone.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of life in it. His words declare that he is not here to play tricks for people to watch, not a young master who is leisurely and boasting about his playthings in front of others. He hopes to obtain "two silver dollars" to fill his "embarrassment." However, what the crowd gave him was disappointment, disappointment. As for myself, even if I had two silver dollars, my house is not a place to raise birds and play with birds. Alas, life!</p>
<h3>Mo Xing</h3>
<p>— Truth</p>
<p>After the cold north wind blows, women with coats put on their winter coats early, wrapping themselves in a posture that adapts to winter. Among them, the posture shown by wearing a black lamb fur style coat inside out seems to have a deeper impression on me.</p>
<p>I am not against women wearing black lamb fur coats; but every time I see a slender woman wrapped in that black lamb fur coat, I can't help but think of "Mo Xing"!</p>
<p>"Mo Xing" is the beloved dog of the German Moloch. He is completely different from the general foreign wolfhound. His figure is slightly taller than our country's Pekingese. And the fur on his whole body is simply like a black sheep. Many people will always associate it with the same spirit as the girl wearing a black lamb fur. Because Mo Dian not only has fur that is cute, but also has a gentle and docile spirit, which is obviously different from the general foreign hunting dogs with an outstanding posture. We all think this is a rare thing.</p>
<p>Mo Xing's owner spent several thousand yuan last year to transport him from Berlin to Nanjing. They usually spend day and night together, inseparable. When the weather is warm in summer, Mo and his fur are not very suitable for the hot sun. For the sake of cherishing him, the owner often asks a professional barber to cut his long hair. The price of each trimming is three yuan and five angles.</p>
<p>Mo Xing squatting on the ground can be counted as like a two-year-old child. He has no tail, and his head is covered with fluffy curly hair, which is even more beautiful. Every time I see Mo Xing, I always think of a woman wearing a black lamb fur coat; at the same time, every time I see a petite woman wearing a black lamb fur coat, I will never forget "Mo Xing"!</p>
<h3>The Secret of Pigeons</h3>
<p>— Li Dabai</p>
<p>How can pigeons fly home from a long distance? This is a very common question, a very simple question. Anyone can answer this question.</p>
<p>The general answer is this:</p>
<p>Because the pigeon's eyes are particularly sharp, and its recognition and memory are extremely strong, so after being tamed, no matter how far it is placed, it can always fly back.</p>
<p>This explanation is the most common and is recognized by most people. At first glance, it seems very right and very reasonable. Therefore, anyone who buys pigeons must first choose the eyes of the pigeons. Good eyes are good pigeons, and bad eyes are bad pigeons. Pigeon keepers also distinguish the value of pigeons by the quality of their eyes. They cherish the ones with the best eyes the most.</p>
<p>In fact, this is only half the reason. The quality of the eyes can certainly determine the quality of the pigeons. However, this is only enough to determine the strength of the pigeon's memory and recognition.</p>
<p>Suppose you take a pigeon raised in Shanghai to Nanjing and release it. At such a long distance, its small eyes cannot see the scenery of Shanghai no matter what. No matter how clearly it recognizes the place where it was raised and how firmly it remembers it, it cannot recognize it hundreds of miles away. Therefore, some people think that pigeons must have other skills to fly home from such a long distance.</p>
<p>This is a secret of pigeons that no one can know.</p>
<p>Regarding the secret of pigeons, many scientists are very interested and are trying to study it intently. However, for many years, they have not been able to study it.</p>
<p>Now, some scientists have discovered that pigeons' bodies can generate a kind of radio wave. They believe that the semicircular grooves on the pigeons' ears, like radio receivers, can receive radio waves within a considerable distance. Based on this radio wave, the pigeon can fly home from that invisible distance.</p>
<p>And some scientists are studying pigeon's radio waves.</p>
<h3>The Teahouse Keeper of Suzhou</h3>
<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>Since the teahouse is a good place for leisure, all kinds of typical people flock to it. After spending a dozen or so copper coins, you can drink a pot of fragrant tea to your heart's content. In addition to drinking tea, they hold a water pipe in their hands, light paper rolls, and smoke, which can further enhance their eloquence. Which family's snacks are long, which family's snacks are short, which family's wine tastes good, which family's wine tastes bad, which family's girl is pretty, which family's girl is beautiful, and they sometimes talk about national affairs there, but they are all irrelevant.</p>
<p>However, some teahouse keepers have side jobs, which is to raise birds in cages. Every morning and afternoon, they take the birds in the cages to their keeper's tea party. It is really leisurely. In the lonely and desolate back streets and alleys, the birds chirp and clamor with him, relieving his boredom on the road.</p>
<p>That's it. Tell the keepers, do you know that China is now suffering from the threat of foreign races, and the border is full of gunshots and gunpowder? The soldiers on the front line are fighting the enemy with their blood and flesh, risking their lives, so you must not be allowed to live on parasitically in a drunken dream. You must know that you are human beings, and life has a mission. Don't forget your mission. (End)</p>
<h3>The Mated Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 10 (Yellow Flowers Add Sorrow to Autumn Heart, Silk Handkerchief Expresses Tenderness, Strange Words Cast Errors)</p>
<p>Then he thought of the piece of paper he had left last time, perhaps he had some intention again. While thinking about this, he also saw the corner of the flower silk handkerchief exposed in the center drawer. After Aunt Liu left, he opened the drawer, and saw only the white silk handkerchief, with red and blue plaid flowers on it. He guessed that it was a woman's thing, and the very strong fragrance told him. Then he saw the note under the handkerchief very clearly. He picked it up and read it twice, and at first he didn't understand what it meant. Later, after thinking carefully, it was clear that he had seen the piece of paper he had written. What did it have to do with it? Why did he leave a handkerchief with such tender feelings? He probably still remembered the words on the note. The last sentence was where he expressed his attitude. He had said that he admired the person I admired, but he had never said a word to him. Didn't he think that it had nothing to do with him? He misunderstood himself, and he couldn't blame anyone. If others knew about it, it would inevitably cause trouble. Especially Jiang Menglan couldn't hear this news, and the friendship between each other would be completely ruined. But this misunderstanding was inconvenient to explain to Youmei. If he told him, wouldn't he be very embarrassed? Now he was hoping that he would help him to communicate with Menglan, and he had also joined this love network. This news could not let him know again. Otherwise, things would be more chaotic. Guoqi got such a piece of paper and a handkerchief, but it added a lot of trouble. Moreover, he lacked the courage to speak to women. If he continued to misunderstand day by day, what would he do in the future, if he continued to write letters like Menglan? Moreover, he could come to his house. Could he just tell him to his face that he didn't love him? Not only could he not bear to say it, but he was also embarrassed to say it. Moreover, he had this misunderstanding, and he might come more often, and I was afraid that his mother would also think things were suspicious. He thought about it for most of the day, but couldn't come up with a solution. The next day, he wanted to go out to avoid him, but he thought he couldn't avoid him, and he couldn't explain what he had misunderstood. He wanted to leave a letter in the drawer and let him read it himself? He thought again that after he read the letter, he would think that he was playing tricks on him and he would be angry? He couldn't solve this problem like yesterday. But this day passed completely, and Youmei never came. Finally, Guoqi prepared a lot of things to say to him, but it was all in vain. (125)</p>

<h3>Tokyo Takarazuka Dance Spectacle</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Before the European War, the Japanese, who were stingy even to eat a bowl of noodles in a Chinese restaurant, have changed greatly in recent years. The theater screen has been doing good business for several years. Taking Tokyo's Takarazuka as an example, it is enough to show that the Japanese have made a fortune and are far from what they used to be.</p>
<p>The main base of the Takarazuka Revue was originally in the suburbs of Osaka. Since the establishment of a music and dance theater in Tokyo, the business has been booming and has not declined to this day. The theatrical program is changed once a month, and it can always be full. The better seats in the center must be reserved on the day, so the drama that starts at 6:00 p.m. has long lines formed as early as 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. The seats in front must be purchased five or six days in advance. At the beginning and end of the performance, the door is full of spectators who want to see the real faces of the actors. Takarazuka is a public performance of a dance school, and all the students are girls. Logically, Takarazuka enthusiasts should be men, but the opposite is true. Japanese modern girls who are Europeanized are called Takarazuka faction "Takarazuka Party", and they are all infatuated with Takarazuka stars. It is said that countless girls have died for Kazuko Hara. At least two-thirds of the seats in Takarazuka are women, and the most noticeable is a group of female students wearing uniforms.</p>
<p>Except for Sundays and holidays, there is only one performance a day, which is the slogan of the founder of Takarazuka, "Entertainment does not hinder business." The price ranges from half a yuan to two yuan, which is very suitable for the taste of the middle class. Therefore, middle school students can save their weekly allowance and enjoy themselves once. The Takarazuka building has only four floors. The top floor is a cafeteria and shop, which is attached with a library and a small theater for children, which is composed of paintings and loudspeakers. After the main musical is over, there is a 30-minute break. The audience can go out to rest, buy things, smoke, or drink tea at will. It remedies the disadvantage of sitting and listening to the construction of the scenery. However, the rest area must be large enough to accommodate them. Each floor has an exhibition to attract the audience, and also serves as an advertisement.</p>
<p>Performing old-style Japanese dramas is also improved to become musicals. However, the narration and acting still do not escape the old-style drama. The new-style song and dance are completely influenced by European and American song and dance movies, and are completely Europeanized. In the Japanese used, English is still mixed from time to time. The script is also based on foreign masterpieces, so even the names of the characters in the play are in Western languages. Although the architecture is not very gorgeous, the singing is very clear. The costumes, decorations, electric lights, and scenery are all top-notch. The number of actors is also large, and there are often fifty or sixty dancers and singers, which is unique in East Asia. However, there is still no improvement or creation in the song and dance itself. This is the result of excessively catering to the psychology of the audience.</p>
<p>Audiences on the third floor can rent a telescope, which is convenient for many people with nearsightedness. If you unfortunately encounter rain on the way home, you can also rent an umbrella to go home, which shows the thoughtfulness of the design. Japanese people often despise the American people's love of singing, dancing, wine, and women, but they have forgotten that they have also embarked on the road of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>The Shaanxi Rebellion is Not Difficult to Resolve Peacefully</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Since Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek escaped from danger in the Xi'an Incident and returned to Nanjing safely, people generally speculated that the aftermath problem would be easily solved and no other problems would occur. Unexpectedly, although Zhang Xueliang came to Nanjing with Generalissimo Chiang, Yang Hucheng defied orders with his troops, entrenched himself, and has continued for more than ten days. The situation is serious, and there is no hope of a peaceful resolution. This is really beyond our expectations.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, this matter is not difficult to resolve smoothly. There are two reasons: ㊀ In Shaanxi, assuming the situation is serious and there is absolute ambition, it must have been more difficult for Generalissimo Chiang to escape from danger. Now that Generalissimo Chiang has arrived in Nanjing safely and is recuperating, Yang Hucheng's defiance of the central government's orders and his turmoil has made this behavior seem inconsistent with what came before. Therefore, I expect it to be easy to resolve, firstly. ㊁ What is the current situation in our country? Although Bailingmiao has been conquered, the situation on the border of Suiyuan is still very serious. As a soldier, Yang Hucheng must understand the responsibility of defending the country. Now, Yang Hucheng is not only not resisting the enemy, but also trying to disrupt the rear, which is not only intolerable by his own conscience, but also cannot be forgiven by the people of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the purpose of Yang Hucheng's rise in the Northwest? Although it is still unknown, I only hope that the central government will be generous, explain the great righteousness, and clarify the advantages and disadvantages, so that these simple-minded soldiers will suddenly realize and obey obediently. Then, our country's strength will not only not be lost at all, but will also be able to make them serve on the frontier and redeem their past mistakes. This is what the people of our country are praying for.</p>
<p>In the event that the central government explains the great righteousness and clarifies the blessings and misfortunes, but they still cling to their evil ways and resist the order to the end, then these domineering and unteachable soldiers have been abandoned by the people of the country, and it will be easy for the national army to suppress them. It is just a matter of time. Therefore, I hope that this matter will be resolved as soon as possible. In the event of a delay, this kind of army will take risks, be used by the Communist Party, or collude with foreign races, and it will be more difficult to eradicate them.</p>
<h3>On the Dock</h3>
<p>— Ping Jun</p>
<p>After the ×× class small steamer left, the dock became deserted.</p>
<p>The small steamer sailed in the middle of the river, laboriously towing two civilian boats, sticking out its narrow chest, and dividing the tender and beautiful river surface. Thus, the calm river water was stirred up with two tiny waves, spreading one by one, and finally, it slammed the weak and annoyed waves against the embankment, but the cold face of the embankment made it fail. Again and again, they retreated with tears-like white foam.</p>
<p>... Gradually, even the blurred shadow of the ferry disappeared.</p>
<p>I was thinking intently that every victim should use a powerful and solid resistance to inflict the shame of frustration on his opponent...</p>
<p>Lin Fugang, with a pipe (old gun), walked over from the intersection with the clumsy steps of a mother duck.</p>
<p>"Are you thinking of throwing yourself into the river, you bastard?" He showed a mouthful of tobacco-stained teeth, each tooth corroded by poison, and the seams were still full of dirty black traces of quinine.</p>
<p>I turned my head to face the river while feeling nauseous and said:</p>
<p>"Death is not a fact that can be avoided. Chronic suicide is not necessarily wiser than acute suicide. Moreover, putting precious life on worthless waste, it seems that 'the meaning of man' is definitely not that simple."</p>
<p>His liver-colored cheeks turned red•——Purple with red, it is another kind of charm. However, I think his blushing is definitely not because of shame. A person who knows shame will not have his spirit going downhill.</p>
<p>"It's bad luck to meet you, a 'rebellious guy', brother. Lao Bao told you that you are very dangerous,...um, very dangerous...it's easy to offend friends! A person will lonely end his life." While speaking, his emotions were very anxious, often saying repetitive words, a bit stuttering. "Do you think loneliness is terrible?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean by what you said?" I felt strange about Lin's pipe's question.</p>
<p>"I said that I'm afraid there are only two of us Cantonese here." He shrugged his thin shoulders and said with a cordial smile.</p>
<p>"Could it be that the locals will eat people?——Even if they eat people, they have to pick the ones with meat."</p>
<p>"Damn you 'light bulb' (a guy who doesn't know what's going on)..." He showed his black teeth again.</p>
<p>So, I laughed victoriously.</p>
<p>The river is now flowing slowly, as if it has felt that all struggles that disregard oneself are superfluous and futile. Quietly, it makes a light and subtle, sigh-like low singing.</p>
<p>The ancient city wall lazily stretches its embrace, inside which stands a pagoda that once had glorious days in history. The red light of the late afternoon sun is staring at the top of the pagoda. ...</p>
<p>All the noise of the ancient city is now silent.</p>
<p>I leaned my body leaning against the railing on the dock a little, I thought, maybe this way I can hear the river's melancholy sigh.</p>
<p>But, Lin Fugang shook my back with his thin, bone-thin palm. And then continued slowly:</p>
<p>"Look, how free and happy that thing is, flying without any worries..."</p>
<p>At this time, a vigorous and steady goshawk is circling</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>circling around the top of the tower. Under the intimidation of the goshawk's emphasized arrogance, the ancient tower drooped its head decadently. Moreover, against the huge and dark shadow of the city wall, a kind of sadness in the late afternoon easily rises from people's hearts.</p>
<p>On the dock, the passengers catching the last boat gradually gathered a few more. Three vagrant soldiers leaned against the railing and chatted loudly. One of them, short and with a fierce light in his eyes, spat a mouthful of phlegm on the river and said:</p>
<p>"×× Town is really a good place."</p>
<p>"………Three years, um………I have been away from that place for a full..." The soldier with a parrot-like face answered dreamily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a beautiful and flirtatious face appeared in the crowd.</p>
<p>Lin's pipe's eyes chased after it.</p>
<p>"That guy is not a good road, I have seen too much of it here on the dock. Once, before getting on the boat, she was whispering in the ear of an old man, and the last time I went to ×× town, I saw her again with a man she didn't know when boarding the boat. They started chatting at first, and when they went ashore, they went arm in arm (meaning walking arm in arm)."</p>
<p>"A prostitute?" Lin's pipe asked me back. Then: "Damn it, the people of Jiangnan have no wife to tie their hair when they are alive, and no burial place when they die——"</p>
<p>"Some of the women in ×× Town have prostitute-like behaviors." I said.</p>
<p>"Under a sound social system, the existence of prostitutes can be considered a shameful thing!"</p>
<p>Lin Fugang slightly raised his head and said in a deep tone.</p>
<p>I turned my eyes again to the goshawk circling around the top of the tower. The vast and boundless dark blue sky sets off a lively, free, and happy black shadow. How I yearn for and love it. So, I sighed.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Back Building</h3>
<p>— Nie Jun</p>
<p>The son of the family in the back building died after being ill for more than ten days. The husband is a casual carpenter. He goes to the foreman's house every day to ask about business. He has a day's work to do only when the foreman takes over a "contract" or other foremen lack manpower. Recently, the foreman has taken over a "contract" to build an ancestral hall. It is said that it is a descendant of a wealthy gentleman who is building a very grand and magnificent ancestral temple for his ancestors. Everything is designed by experts and skilled workers, and it is expected to be completed in six months. This business is more beneficial than building a house, because a house is for living people, and in addition to the beautiful appearance, it must also be considered strong and durable. Building an ancestral hall is not like this. The content can be increased or decreased at will, as long as the appearance is magnificent. That's what the descendants originally meant. If the newly built ancestral hall adds a scenic spot to the local area, it will be satisfactory! The foreman can indeed sit back and eat for several years on this business. Those casual workers seem to see the benefits, and there is no need to worry about whether there will be work to do tomorrow for six months. What they fear most is running to the foreman's house every day for nothing.</p>
<p>The casual carpenter in the back building had a son a month ago. He already has five daughters, but the son is the first. Usually, when there is no work to do, the carpenter often gets drunk and scolds people. He doesn't complain about not having work to do, but scolds his wife as a "white tiger spirit", saying that she has been unlucky since she entered the door, and that she has raised those "money-losing goods" one after another. The woman seems to be used to this. She always rushes to do things and doesn't say a word, or she simply doesn't listen; because we who live in the front building know what he is going to say as long as the craftsman gets drunk.</p>
<p>After raising a son, there was a period of quiet. Even if there was no work to do, he would hug the child, quite like a father. My wife once said with emotion: I don't know when it will be possible to break the habit of valuing men over women in China? Not to mention the rich, they are afraid that so much money will be wasted after death. Just like the carpenter who is so poor that he scolds his wife as a white tiger spirit when he has no work to do, he also values his son so much. It seems that he has food to eat when he has a son!</p>
<p>My wife's emotion was fulfilled. A month after giving birth to a son, the craftsman had six months of work to do. Now he is drinking again, naturally drunk every time, but he praised his wife's belly for being good: "When the time comes, good luck comes, raising a son brings ingots!" A son really dominates the joys and sorrows of their family, although the wife still doesn't say a word; she now has more things to do with the child.</p>
<p>However, good times do not last long, and this situation only lasted for more than a month. The precious son fell ill, and it looked very dangerous. He cried all day long, and he also asked a doctor. The doctor didn't know what he said, but after four or five days, the back building was almost like a fire, with loud crying and shouting, and even the neighbors secretly came to the back door to ask. The carpenter was probably eager to love his son, or he was planning to raise money to treat his son, and he didn't want to go to work even if he had a good job. That rough voice stayed in the back building as if it was a clown on the stage. He would shut his mouth and not say a word even if his wife scolded him a few times.</p>
<p>The son finally died after being ill for more than ten days. It was not dawn when he died. I heard clearly that the back building burned a few small clothes. The couple was silent and did not say a word. The oldest "money-losing goods" was crying for her brother, but she was crying very sadly.</p>
<p>At noon, the carpenter invited a friend to carry the small coffin out. I just met him at the alley, and he walked as fast as usual, as if the one who died was not his son.</p>
<p>The back building is quiet again, they are all recalling that nightmare! The next day, the husband went to work, but that was really bad news. Another carpenter had replaced him in his job. The foreman's reason was also very sufficient. They signed a contract to deliver the goods within a time limit. If you don't come to do it, he will do it.</p>
<p>Naturally, the "white tiger spirit" broke out again, and the sound of a glass thing being smashed was heard. This time, the wife replied: "Poverty is always poverty in life. The white tiger spirit also gave you a son. Can you afford it, you poor ghost, really never ending debt collectors!"</p>
<p>A "money-losing goods" suddenly cried out in a hoarse voice, probably because the woman grabbed her to vent her anger.</p>

<h3>Soviet Documentary "Abyssinia"</h3>
<p>The war to seize colonies that took place in Abyssinia was carried out in the name of "spreading civilization", but the brutal lessons of airplanes and cannons will never be forgotten by the invaded.</p>
<p>And the film "Abyssinia" is an even better memorandum.</p>
<p>This film was shot by the Soviet Film News Factory special correspondent accompanying the army of Abyssinia on the front line. It fully explains what the fascists called "spreading civilization", exposes the true face of the invaders, and records the cruelty of conquering the natives of the colony. And from the correct point of view, the film repeatedly shows how the invaded used all their strength to resist the enemy as much as possible, not to submit, not to fear difficulties, and to fight for the independence of their motherland.</p>
<p>This Soviet documentary will be shown publicly at the Shanghai Grand Theater.</p>

<h3>Interview with "Amateur Actors"</h3>
<p>Performing at the Carlton starting the 24th of this month</p>
<p>Almost every day is an all-nighter. They and she are not tired at all and don't want to rest. The whole house is about to be torn down and burned by their passionate spirits.</p>
<p>Upstairs and downstairs, they are doing their final rehearsals. Shen Xiling stands solemnly like a military instructor, staring intently at each actor and shouting sternly: "All ready!" The air is so tense. Li Lin begins to feel emotional, his voice sounding like he's about to cry. "Not enough, not enough emotion! The sound must be audible at least fifty rows of seats away!" Shen Xiling shouts like this, and Zhao Dan says from the side: "Z. G."</p>
<p>So, they do it again.</p>
<p>Here are Junli and Lan Ping, Lü Ban and Ye Luxi, they are two couples of joy and sorrow. As soon as Lan Ping sees Junli, she almost cries. As for Lü Ban, he is holding a guitar, dressed in Cossack attire, and singing Russian-style songs in a drawn-out voice. His lover Ye Luxi arrives, and he immediately embraces her, "Haha!" Lü Ban laughs again, showing a triumphant look.</p>
<p>The director, Zhang Min, sits silently on the side, calmly observing everyone's movements and postures.</p>
<p>That's another room, with a group of young people, they are planning the editing of the commemorative special issue, developing photos, and drawing posters, so busy that they don't have a moment to stop.</p>
<p>Tang Na and Yi Ming are also busy distributing paper to everyone to sign and write a commemorative message for this performance, because it will be published in the commemorative special issue.</p>
<p>Yuan Muzhi: Theater is my maiden home, and film is my husband's home. I haven't returned since marrying two years ago. I can't stay for long in this busy schedule, so I'll wait for spring. (General meaning)</p>
<p>Zheng Junli – Now we need a big thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan – I give my life to the stage.</p>
<p>Lan Ping – I want to be Desha, not Katerina.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian – One performance is one performance.</p>

<p>Automobile Special Issue</p>
<h3>New 1937 Studebaker Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>New 1937 Studebaker automobile. It has now arrived by sea. The Yuantong Automobile Company, Studebaker dealer at No. 1 Mu Bu Yabei Road, is currently unboxing it. It will soon be displayed in the showroom for public viewing. In terms of basic aspects, the new car does not have much difference compared to the 1936 model. However, in terms of aesthetics, safety, economy, and utility, the various new inventions and features of the new car have reached their peak, truly surpassing previous products. The new car is divided into two groups: the President series and the Commander series. The great progress in mechanical engineering of the President series is numerous. Among them, the automatic shift selection is the most remarkable. It can be used at any speed above 35 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The special rear axle is another significant feature of the Studebaker President and Commander series new cars. Its gear design is between helical bevel gears and worm gears, making it the most effective gear combination. Because the new car is equipped with this type of rear axle, the rear floor of the car can be lower without sacrificing ground clearance. The floor near the car door is three and sixteen-hundredths inches lower, greatly increasing the height of the door without increasing the overall height of the car. One of the reasons why the interior of the new car is spacious and comfortable, making it easy to get in and out, is the use of this type of rear axle.</p>
<p>The new-style double-drop frame is another advancement of the 1937 Studebaker. Its strength and solidity are even greater than the 1936 model. The new shock absorbers on the new car are integrated with the chassis, unlike ordinary ones that are merely an additional accessory. The new shock absorbers are not nailed to the frame, nor are they connected to the axles, making them so-called direct-acting. Their structure is extremely compact, and automatic temperature controllers, etc., are all included.</p>
<p>In terms of driving management, the new Studebaker is handy and easy to operate, something that older models could not hope to achieve. The reason for this is that the new car is equipped with the latest dual-rod steering wheel. This compound steering wheel has an excellent design and a simple structure. It makes parking and turning more convenient, and it also allows for easier control over the speed of the car, allowing drivers to fully enjoy the pleasure of driving. Its mechanical strength and resistance to road shocks have been greatly increased, and its lifespan has also been extended due to the reduced need for frequent inspections.</p>
<p>The generator equipped on the Studebaker President series new car is equipped with an automatic current and voltage regulator, so the battery can be fully charged regardless of the car's speed, and there is no risk of overcharging under any driving conditions. All new cars, whether President series or Commander series, are equipped with Fuller's oil and motor purifiers, so the oil generally does not need to be changed except for seasonal changes. The well-known Studebaker choke has been further improved and simplified, making it easier than before to perform timely inspections. The new choke has three calibration methods that can be adjusted according to the different carbon content of the motor fuel. This adjustment method is not only mastered by any repairman, but any driver can easily understand and master it in three to five minutes.</p>
<p>The 1937 Studebaker Commander series new car is equipped with rubber-insulated free joints, so its drive is smooth and the moving parts are not subject to corrosion, and there is no need for lubrication. The fact that the Studebaker new car is extremely smooth and quiet at high speeds is greatly related to this device. All new cars are also equipped with special starter clutches, so even in the cold winter, it is very easy to start. Once cranked, it can naturally continue until the engine starts.</p>
<p>Another change in the chassis of the new car is the position of the parking brake lever, which is located just below the dashboard on the left side of the steering wheel. It is more convenient for the driver to operate directly. As for the floor of the front compartment, clutter is eliminated and the space is wider, making it extremely convenient to enter and exit from the left door. Furthermore, both Studebaker series new cars are equipped with new-style harmonic gears, making shifting effortless and very flexible. Other features, such as automatic hill hold, which was first created by Studebaker last year as a safety feature, are still used on the 1927 series new cars. The engines of the new cars have been improved, making them more refined due to the reforms to the main bearings, engine rubber brackets, and crankshaft balance, so their smoothness and quietness are beyond what has been achieved in the past. (To be continued)</p>
<p>▲A car assembled from leftover parts. A man named Peng Pulaisidong in Huichi Tai, Gansas State, USA, used the leftover parts from 25 cars damaged in car accident cases to assemble the car in the left picture. These 25 damaged cars sacrificed the lives of 37 people. Some parts of this pieced-together car came from cars used by bandits and destroyed during police chases.</p>

The British Department of Transportation stipulates that from January 1st, all windshields or front windows of cars should be replaced with safety glass to reduce danger. This regulation does not apply to the front windows of the upper level of double-decker buses. The Department of Transportation's regulations regarding the use of safety glass require that all new cars manufactured after January 1, 1932, must have windshields and front windows made of safety glass. However, for cars already in use, there is a mandatory deadline of January 1, 1937, to replace them. According to estimates by the Automobile Manufacturers Association, approximately 300,000 privately owned cars and 200,000 freight cars currently in use are not equipped with safety glass. Therefore, after this regulation is implemented next month, 500,000 car owners will be affected. However, it is said that the installation procedure for this type of glass is quite fast, requiring only a few hours. The price is approximately £2 to £3.</p>
<p>▲Nuffield donates funds to build a church. Over the years, the expansion of the British Morris car factory has led to a gradual increase in the population of Cowley Village, where the workers live. When the Morris factory was first established, its population was only over 200. Today, it has jumped to 25,000. The original church in the area was sufficient when there were few residents. However, today, due to the large number of listeners, it cannot accommodate everyone on Sundays. Many latecomers are turned away. Lord Nuffield, the owner of Morris, has donated £35,000 to build two more large-scale churches.</p>
<p>▲Estimated freight car production. According to Mr. Baike, the sales director of the Freight Car and Commercial Vehicle Communication Group of the Chrysler Automobile Company, the total number of freight cars produced and sold in the United States this year will reach 830,000, an increase of 20% compared to 1936. Mr. Baike also said that the production volume in the last three months of 1935 was 180,000 units. If this number is increased by 20%, the production volume for the same quarter this year could reach 216,000 units. Adding this number to the already estimated 618,000 units, the freight car volume for the entire year could reach approximately 834,000 units. Isn't 830,000 units more than enough?</p>
<p>▲Hettison's amazing exhibition. At the auto show held in New York this time, Hettison and Toula Ping had two amazing exhibitions that were highly praised by visitors. They were called "Indoor Driving" and "Self-Talking Car." For the first item, a huge glass movie screen was set up indoors. Visitors sitting in front of this screen would see the scenery of the road reflected on the screen, as if they were driving in the suburbs. At this time, the "driver" could use the "movie" to change gears according to the different road scenes.</p>
<p>The second item, "Automatic Speaking Car," when visitors stepped into this car, they would hear a voice coming from somewhere in the car. However, the tone was directed at them. And sometimes it could call the visitor's name, and then explain the features of the new car in great detail. The guests did not feel that it was verbose.</p>
<p>▲Factories rush to manufacture new cars day and night. After the New York Auto Show closed, factories rushed to deliver orders. Therefore, around mid-November, factories began working day and night in order to meet the market demand in time. Buick's production has reached its highest production capacity due to the urgent need for retail sales. The factory's production volume for December has been set at 28,000 units. Friday, December 6th, saw a total production volume of 1,333 units, of which 1,061 were domestic orders. In addition, there were still 56,123 outstanding orders. According to Buick CEO, Koudishi, the estimated production volume for Buick in 1937 is 247,000 units. Chevrolet new cars are also being manufactured because of the high market demand. In mid-November, the daily production of cars had already increased fivefold to 5,000 units. However, because it was not enough to meet the demand, it was further increased to 6,000 units per day. Nash new cars have received 24,000 orders after being exhibited at the New York Auto Show and other places for two days. Since then, the number of orders has continued to increase. The factory is also rushing to manufacture cars in order to adapt to the environment.</p>
<p>▲Chevrolet wins first choice again. According to the regulations of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, at each auto show, the manufacturer whose products have the greatest value in terms of sales has the priority to choose the venue first. At this year's New York Auto Show, this right was again won by Chevrolet. This is because the Chevrolet model for this year has sold 1,125,000 units, and it has once again won the first choice. Chevrolet has been the manufacturer with the largest annual car sales for the seventh time in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Automobile driving safety campaigns are receiving a great deal of attention from municipal authorities in Europe and the United States. The city of Chicago in the United States has recently established two automobile driving experiment grounds specifically for teaching the public safe automobile driving techniques. The equipment in each is very complete. Furthermore, many senior schools are now making automobile driving methods a required course. As shown in the picture, this is one corner of the classroom. The students' desks are all shaped like driving steering wheels.</p>

<h3>Detroit City Orders Ford Large Long-Distance Buses</h3>
<p>The Detroit city street railway recently ordered 500 Ford V-8 city buses from the Ford Motor Company. Purchasing so many buses at once is truly the first large order of its kind in the entire United States.</p>
<p>The delivery deadline is within ninety days, with the last of these 500 vehicles being handed over to the railway company next spring. These vehicles are new-style buses that can accommodate 25 people, designed by the Ford Motor Company in consultation with Detroit Street Railway engineers. The aim is to provide a most modern vehicle for low-cost, high-speed operation in the city's most congested traffic areas.</p>
<p>The railway company's management has had a total of 331 Ford V-8 buses running on Detroit's busiest roads for the past two years. The large-scale purchase of new-style buses this time was decided after careful inspection of the past. The mileage of the existing Ford V-8 buses is increasing day by day and month by month, with the total monthly mileage exceeding one million miles. The first bus has already traveled more than 120,000 miles.</p>
<p>Detroit is the center of the entire diamond car industry, so this transaction is a practical compliment to the manufacturers of Ford cars and trucks.</p>
