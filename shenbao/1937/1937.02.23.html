<h3>蔣委員長發表談話</h3>
<p>開放言論祇禁止三點　集中人才當充分實現　赦免政治犯應有限制</p>
<p>［南京］蔣委員長於日前全會散會後、接見記者於會塲休息室、記者以外間對開放言論與集中人才二二點、異常注意、特叩詢中央今後之方針、並詢問關於赦免政治犯問題、中央討論與决定之經過、承二答覆如下、</p>
<p>㊀開放言論　此次提案中提及此點者甚多、且亦為各地言論界所注意、中央當然重視之、但中央過去並未限制言論自由、除刑法及出版法已有規定外、祇對於下列三種、不能不禁止、一·宣傳赤化與危害國家擾亂地方治安之言論與紀載、二·洩漏軍事外交之機密、三·有意願倒是非捏造毫無事實根據之謠言、除些三者以外、本屬開放、本屬自由、而且亦希望全國一致尊重合法之言論自由、但我國疆城廣大、各地對於開放言論、每不能一致、往往有中央所許可或為中央所發表之消息、而地方當局轉不許發表、與論界時有煩言、須知中央極尊重言論自由、斷不欲有意外之限制、今後更當本此主旨、改善管理新聞與出版物之辦法、且當進一步扶助言論出版事業之發展、使言論界在不背國家利益下、得到充分貢獻之機會、現各地當局既亦有此種要求、希望各地當局、今後一致做去、對於中央所許可發表之消息、不可隨便禁止、務使全國所有消息、得以暢達於國家之每一部分、以收統一意志之效、</p>
<p>㊁集中人才　近來各方頗注重此點、大會中亦曾討論及此、其實中央數年來卽本此方針而行、中央不但要集中人才、而且要多方徵集人才、來共同努力挽救國家、但不能照共產黨與所謂人民陣錢者之説法、使反覆投機之政客、與搗亂國家煽惑各省破壞統一之分子、皆得託於集中人才之名以作獵官之階梯、中央認為國家目前所迫切需要之人才、為眞能貢獻於國家一切文化經濟建設之專家、並不限於文章言説之土、更不是繼橫椑闔奔走政治之輩、要知此種觀念如不矯正中國卽不能進為統一進步之現代國家、所以中央數年來之方針、不但要集中人才、而且要保育人才、獎進人才、對於獎進眞正人才、並不在乎與以祿位、使之做官、而在便各地人才、能發揮其專長之能力、在各地社會上、做種種事業、政府近來對各省事業盡量補助、促其發展、卽在實行總理人盡其才之遺訓、亦所以促成國家之建設，此次全會中提有中國經濟建設方案、業已通過、此項方案之實行、正不知需要多少專門家與人才也、從政治方面説、中央十年以來、延攬黨外有能力之分子、不知凡幾、事實上對於民國十三年以前之各黨各派、早無岐視、更無排斥之意、尤共是對國內具有眞實學問與愛國熱忱之知識分子、與大學教授、更是虛心諮訪、極意尊重、切望其在教育文化上、在政治經濟各種建設上盡量貢獻、培育有用之青年、完成建國之大業、所以集中人才一層、可説是中央一貫之方針、今後必更進一步的期其充分實現、凡眞正愛國而願在同一自標之下、為國家盡力者、自必與以尊重、且亦歡迎之不暇、</p>
<p>㊂赦免政治犯問題　國事危急至現在地步、建國工作又如此追切、中央對於國內、自必以寬大平恕、召致和平、以謀一切之安定、對於過去政治上犯有過誤者、矜惜寬免、不乏其例、但現在之所謂政治犯、卽為反對國家破壤社會之共產黨及反動份子、對於此等罪犯、定有自新條例、凡經察有悔悟實跡、准許保釋者、已不在少數、故祇要此等份子、眞正覺悟、不再乘此國內嚴重之機、作搗亂國家破壞統一之舉、其悔過自新且有人保證者、當然可個別予以寬免、但如不問有無悔悟誠意、而普遍的一概赦免、則中央為重視國家之法紀、保證社會之安甯、决不能隨便出此、政府有政府之責任、寬大有寬大之辦法、不能漫無限制、以姑息為政、而貽害社會、此當為國人所共諒、</p>
<p>總之、吾人今後必須集中全國之意志與力量、眞誠坦白、做到團結一致、負責力行，以挽救國家目前之困難、深信全國愛國人土，必能擁護本屆全會之决議、而共同努力也、（廿二日中央社電）</p>

<p>［南京］林主席二十二日晨在國府紀念週、講個人自由與國家自由、“原調如下、</p>
<p>各位同志、這幾目中央開三中全會、關於全會重要的决議事項、報章多己登載、各位均可知道、今天上午大會行閉幕禮後、還有宣言發表、關於內政外交等各方面、應該如何進行及努力、各位看到宣言後、亦可明白、所以今天本席對於全會經過、不再報告、兹講“個人自由與國家自由、”總理在民權主義第三講當中説、“個人不可太過自由、國家要得完全自由、到了國家能夠行動自由、中國便是強盛的國家、要這樣做去、便要火家犧性自由、”總理的意思、是要我們犧性個人的自由、來爭取國家的自由，這當中的道理、現在説起來、覺得最關重要、所以本席今天特提出這個間題來講講、甚麼呌做自由呢、總理説、“自由的解釋、簡單言之，在一個團體中能夠活動來往自如、便是自由、”又説、“歐洲由羅馬亡後、到二三百年以前、君主的專制、是很進步的、所以人民所受的痛苦、也是很利害、很難忍受、當時歐洲的人民、既然受着這種不自由的痛苦、所以便要起來革命、爭取個人的自由、法國的大革命、就是這樣發生的、他們爭得個人自由後、更用法律來加以保障、這就是後來各國憲法上規定自由權的由來、他們有了這種自由權、起初也很能利用、做出許多事業來、原來那時候歐洲的經濟情形、還很落後、正要大量的人力去開發、而當時歐洲的人民、却根能利用自由的權力、去做這種經濟開發的事業、使後來的經濟情形，獲得驚人的發展、間接促進社會的進多、這樣説來、可見個人的自由、從前對於人類社會、也有過很大的貢獻、這是我們不可忽視的、不過個人自由運用到極點、便會生出許多弊害、這種弊害最顯著的、就是貧富階級懸殊的現象、為要免除這種弊害、所以現在世界的潮流、又與法國大革命的情形相反、大家都不認個入有完全自由、在政治上對於個人的自由權、都加以種種的限制、在經濟上，就有統制經濟等等的主張來代替自由競爭的學説，近來更有人主張國家是高於一切的有機體、個人只是國家不可分的一部份、沒有獨立的目的、應該為國家而犧性、從這種主張看來、就可見現在世界潮流的趨向了、再就我國來講、現在我們應不應該主張個人自由、依總理所説的、我們個人不但不應賅太過於自由、并且還要犧牲個人的自由，這當中的道理、有幾點可分開來講、第一、就是因為我們本來有很充分的自由、中國的古語説“日出而作、日入而息、鑿井而飲、耕田而食、帝力於我何有哉、這幾句話、就可證明我們有個人的充分自由、不必再求發展、第二、現在世界的潮流所趨，都不講個人自由了、這在前面我們巳經説過、所以我們也不能違反世界的潮流、再去講個人自由、第三、因為從前我們的自由太多、大多便形成一片散沙、沒有團結的力量、所以遇到外來勢力的壓迫、便不能抵抗、以致弄成現在這種地步、是我們已經深中個人自由之害、非另外想法子來挽救不可、至於我們耍犧牲個人的自由、也有三點可説、第一，現在我們國家、是很不自由的、我們要求國家的自由、就只有打破個人的自由、結成很堅固的團體、從事奮鬥、第二、社會進步、事務日多、這些事務、有許多不是個人新辦理的、所以在事實上、對於個人自由行動的範圍也不能不加以限制、這是為保障公共福利起見，不能不這樣、第三，在國家遇着非常事故的時侯、要能够應付得當、達到保全國家利益的目的、最要緊的還是在全國人民能夠服從國家的領導、一致行動、所以對於個入的自由、也不能不暫時的犧牲、這在歐美各國、都是有先例的，否則在這個時候、如果還要擴大個人自由，那就會分散國家的力量、加重國家的困離、總而言之、從前因為我們的自由太多、以致形成一片散沙、沒有組織、所以才受入家的侵路、現在我們要抵抗這種侵略、就要大家能夠犧性個人的自自、結成很堅固的團體、近來政府舉辦保甲等等、也就是要把大家組織起來、貫徹團結的目的、完成國家的自由、將來在整個國家獲得自由後、那時侯我們再來提倡個人自由、才有實際、（廿二日中央社電）</p>

<h3>三中全會閉幕</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>舉國屬目之三中全會。已於昨日宣告閉幕。本屆大會。承西安事變之後。緩戰醖釀之際。回皇之人心。游移之策略。胥有待於大會之鎮撫與决定。所負之賣仕旣重。所繫之期望彌殷。故於開會之先。各中委均肯不憚迢遞。踴躍參加。會議席上。復能屏絕浮華。集中討論。其所昭示於國人者。固巳極盡團結之能事矣。抑吾人所懸懸翹企者。尤在於內外國策之確定。俾有式循之方針。此次大會中不少重要提案。其决議見諸報端者。如西安事變之報告與處置。蔣委員長之辭職與慰留。國民大會召集期之决定。代表選舉法修正之授權。均為吾人所急欲得一結論者。今巳獲原則之通過。不離覘以後之躍進。衆望所饜。宣無間然。就中更有為一般人心目所縈注。而具有無限深切之意味者。則大會主席團所提關於根絕赤禍之議案是已。斯一議案。豈特國內上下認為非常重要之問題。即在國外人士。稍具關切之懷。當亦無不焦神悚慮。屏息凝佇。以耽視此情態之推移。</p>
<p>處外侮日亟之今日。集中國力之口號。久為通國所共喻。自非別具肺腸。孰不盼其實現。所謂集中國力云者。即凡屬中華民國之人民。均應傾向團結而力避意志之渙離。凡屬中華民國之物力。均應曲加讓惜而勿作無謂之犧牲。在禦侮目標之下。一切怨恨。應就消弭。一切意見。應便融化。如此方足以救亡而圖存。非此决不能匡危而定傾。天經地義。豈容否認。共產黨人旣屬國民之一份子。自當深明斯義。共維大局。不幸過去事實。猶多未能相諒。致造成“赤禍”之恐慌。而分散對外之力量。今讀大會主席團之議案。謂“共黨於窮蹙邊隅之餘。倡輸誠受命之説。本當以博愛為懷。决不斷人自新之路。“是共黨已知通去之非計。密謀輸誠而受命。雖其經過如何。猶雞洞稔眞相。要其有此表示。當係確切事實。更觀中央所規定之輸誠辦法。如取消一切破壞統一之組織。停止階級鬥爭赤化之宣傳。類能就實際之必須。作嚴正之指示。共黨方面果有眞誠合作之意。宜無不可照辦之處。則赤禍自可根絕於無形。而全國獲得整個之團結。此固本屆大會最大之收穫也。然非中央德意遠被。曷克臻此。蓋中央數年以來。本其力謀團結之旨。一以客忍寬大為懷。遠之如應付粵桂糾紛。近之如處置西安事變。無不委曲求全。刻意讓步。卒能感格人心。斡旋危局。迄於今兹。并號稱水火難容之共產黨人。亦復輸誠。來謀合作。則此後國內。自可更無分崩離析之憂。而一致對外。亦得永免捉襟現時之處。吾人不敏。惟有馨香禱祝。以盼共黨翰誠之實現。以期全國團結之成功。</p>

<h3>日陸相在議會席上再言增軍必要</h3>
<p>並辯稱對華無侵略意　政府避免與政黨衝突　預算案可望通過議會</p>
<p>［東京］陸相今日在貴衆爾院説明最近之內外情勢·遠東軍備之充實·歐洲之軍備狀態等、次言蘇聯雖稱縮少軍備、然未實行、且日本陸軍尤其日本軍備、與蘇聯之遠東軍十五師防備上到底不能比較、陸相並謂日本對之惟有充實兵力、而第一須充實航空談空、第二增強在滿兵器、第三增強在滿兵力、第四整備作戰資材等、（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］衆院預算總會今日午後舉行會議時、政友會牧野氏、請解釋大陸政策、陸相杉山元斷言軍部對大陸政策未予以特別之重視、而所認為急務者、為㊀從事“滿洲國”健全之發展、㊁鑒於中日關係不可分離之事實、促進中日兩國經濟及文化之提携、杉山並鄭重宣稱、陸軍甚至未有對華侵略之計劃云、（中央社二十二日電）</p>
<p>［東京］衆院預定於二十五日停止預算總會之質問、開分科會、而於三月三日開總會决定各項事件、截至今日為止、政民兩黨委員在預算總會中，關於調整地方財政交付金之增加·修正預算·及結城藏相財政之矛盾有所討論、並稍有觸及其核心之點、而雖對於政府之敷衍答辯抱不滿意、然未曾發揮任何威力、因此未得具體的效果、預算總會不過平安進行其預定路程而已、唯有增加地方財政交付金與預算形式論之返還政府問題、尚有惹起低氣壓之可能性、卽非僅政友民政兩黨、至於無產黨興小會派亦由同樣立塲、共同追求此兩問題、其中有強硬意見、主張現政府態度如何而出於斷然態度、故今後繼續二次三次論戰、此問題漸增其深度、結果不免發生小波瀾、亦未可知、然在政府方面如其在議會中言明、擬將地方交付金問題之怛久策、交下屆議會討論、認十二年度之漸定預算七千萬元、比諸前內閣之計劃毫無遜色、故力避卽時增加其數、擬以樹立恒久策為條件、請求諒解、至於預算之形式問題、林首相雖於二十日預算總會言明研究本問題、然由諸般事情面論、殊難闡明節減陸海軍預算各二千三百萬元之事、故决意在提出修正案時、始終以當初决定之方針邁進、因此政黨愈追求此問題、則政府與議會之對立愈激化、但以過去情勢論、政黨能否敢然向政府前進、殊屬疑問、據一般觀察政黨與政府將必實行政治的妥協而可决預算案、殆無疑義，（二十二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>基隆事件求和平解决</h3>

<h3>日本將致力調整對英關係</h3>
<p>［東京］日政府因英國於日德反共協定成立後之對日態度、對於日本今後外交政策有重要開係、極注意其表面與裏面之行動、據最近各方面情報、英國外交界今日情况、與日德協定成立當時有變化、英國外務當局意見、傾向主張從新檢討從來認識不足之對日政策、英國編制龐大國防預算、而由打算實理之見地、反省其對日態度之過度、並在此歐洲非常時期、擬將從來艾登外交加以改革、卽英國編製五年計劃十五億鎊之大國防預算對抗德國、以期萬無遺憾、在此時際、日本政府與德提携、必然促進德國之強化工作、英政府內部發生議論，主張變更其外交政策、由此觀之、英國今後必然出於實行阻止日本進入德國陣營政策之態度、殆無疑義、因此對於英國國防充實、放棄日英親善之議論、使用極端神經以路透通信否認此説、至於對華問題、英國雖於從來不無與日本採取協力的態度、然日本政府决定始終以冷靜態度、注視英國之對日動向、總之、今年春季日皇弟秩父宮赴英之前後時期、日英兩國之間必有頻繁交涉、日政府旣對駐英吉田大使發訓電、蒐集各方面情報、同時决定方針調整兩國關係、（二十二日同盟電）</p>

<h3>統一救國的眞詮</h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>統一救國變為實際的民族陣綫後，這一陣綫的開展是要經過不少的鬥爭的，我想，駱先生一定比我知道得更清楚，年來由蔣姿員長領導的統一運動、得到今日的結果，會費了多少喉舌，奔走和鬥爭，卽就西安事變説，這一和平解决又費了多少折衝呢！這項材料還是很新鮮的呀！這不是鬥爭是什麼？這方是統一的開始啊——這裏已有策略興戰術上的鬥爭了。過去不幸的是我們先沒有建立共同的陣綫，所以鬥爭常常出了常軌，至釀成西安這次不幸的事件，幾乎造成大錯。在統一的大前提確定下，鬥爭雖仍然會是我説的，是“不可否認的事實，一但不會走出一定的軌道，它的發展是隨民族抗戰而發展的，我為什麼把“聯合戰綫看成一種鬥爭過程，”我不過是實際的根據各社會勢血在實際行動中不是靜止狀態而觀察的結果，運動是動的啊，是發展的啊！每一個社會勢力在運動中總要表現它的特點的，在統一的行動中，一個策略一種戰術，總要通過各種討論才能確定，並且一個正確的策略往往總是經過無數爭辨才能得到，眞理常常是產生在鬥爭中，所以我説“聯合戰綫內部可以説是全賴於這種鬥爭而生存發展”“聯合而恐懼內部鬥爭而迥避應有的鬥爭，不能不是對聯合戰綫有利而是對共同的神聖戰爭的一種不忠實。”我這番話，自信説得很明顯，我説的內部鬥爭，絕非丧心病狂的主張在聯合抗戰中，多來幾次西安事變所採用的手段，自毀自己的陣營意思，不想這一意義竟被駱先生所誤解了。</p>
<p>我不知道以上的解釋是否巳釋駱先生的誤會，但我能得這一次的機會再來解釋這些話，我不能不感謝駱先生。我自問我與駱先生都是同一救國途上的友人，彼此素味平生原説不上半點個人的恩怨。駱先生對於我個人的誤會，主要的是出自人民陣綫與民族陣綫的混同。我想，經了這次解釋後，大致無不能彼此了解之理罷！</p>
<p>然而我還不能己於言者，卽今日中國祉會人士，愛國之心原不後人，而認識還甚模糊的人方甚多，對於統一救國的眞詮多不能有一個具體輪廓，過去許多不幸事實，不正確的觀念常常在作弄入影響人，致妨害人與人間的聯結，成為精神統一的障碍。這障碍之一，就是由於錯誤的觀念育成的狹隘性𢪝它性，限止報國有心的人走到救國道途上來，這是我常常引為最所痛心的事。今日還有成見很深的人，戴着颜色眼鏡去看人，愛將颜色無端的加在别人身上，改造成国力的分解，卽令世人本心原是為國，結果也無形的造成了紛亂，間接的帮助了敵人，教寫到這裏，我眞不禁墮下淚來，今日一切具有民族意識的人，誠應如何反省自己，糾正這一偏狹性啊！</p>
<p>最後我要高呼全民族統一救國萬歲，結成織的民族陣綫！反對不合中國國情的人民陣綫！以及出賣中國的漢奸陣綫！並向駱先生致民族敬禮！（完）</p>

<h3>敬告中國護士界（下）</h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>㊂保障職業延綿：我們要想護士職業能永遠存在，必對於職業之保障，有具體之辦法，因為護士每月所得着之薪金，如此之微末，僅可供给每月生活費用，維持一月生活的現狀，事實上就沒有儲藏積蓄的可能性，一旦超過四十歲以上，因其生理演進使護士入於老年，他的職務和工作效能隨之發生搖動，有失業之危險，一旦失業後，再幹其他職業，又無專門技長，從商不得，就業不能，不免有餓斃之虞，所以，假如對於職業的將來，亳無保障的辦法，來學習護士職業的人士，是不會踴躍，護士事業永遠不能發展，並且講士職業還要崩潰滅亡之途，不能永遠繼續延綿下去，那護士職業的生存，僅不過是時間的問題，故深望護教會諸公，對於職業保障的實旅，不可忽視為渺小，和預防醫學的創設是一樣性質，結果在將來，請愼重加以研究和注意之。</p>
<p>㊂給予未來伙件們的辭言。</p>
<p>時代的廻輪，不斷地展開“物競天擇”的現賞時代韶光易逝，葬送了青年頭髪染成雪白色素的快走，當我們做護生時代，先就得認識自己，是準備將來服務社會的後備軍，儲藏食糧的運輪者，如何去努力學藝，建筑品格，緊緊把握着光陰和時代，不尤許它如流水般的逝去，消失，空掷過去，不要為社會下意識所薰陶，求虛榮，崇奢侈，應建立自己良好的品格，學識，及健康身心，我們需要做一個好學生，好國民，是我們唯一的人生哲學。</p>
<p>明日護士教育是一日一日的革新，護士職業也是與時並進的難幹，如果在學習時馬馬虎虎的過去，一無所長，在現時代現社會是站立不住腳的，終歸為其淘汰的，未來伙伴們！起來吧！短短三年，將如何的鼓舞振作，埋頭努力，以準備將來服務社會之需耍哩，只有引證四書上一句：“曾子曰：………吾日三省吾身……”做我們常頭的棒喝。卽至到了服務社會時，應有二種意識把握住：</p>
<p>㊀學者的態度：假如服務社會時，沒有學者的態度，不但事業上收不到發展的成績，並且對於事業不免有感是機械生活的痛苦，敷衍塞青的工作，如果具以學者的眼光，服務社會，刻刻時時會使你感到與趣，入生的抱負，探其因，追其究，服務數十年，等於是一日，同時事業是一天一天的進步。</p>
<p>㊁孩子的心靈：孩子的心靈，可以説是純潔的，好奇的，熱烈的，前進的虛心的……，我們服務社會的份子，如果皆具有孩子的心腸，貪官朽吏，營私作弊，是不會產生出現的，孩子的一舉一動，是葵本着良心，待人接物不會虛偽獻媚，卑鄙齷齪，故孩子的心靈，如成人時永遠不失掉孩子的好心腸，他們的人生，一日比一日富有詩意，快樂，所以孩子心靈燃燒起來吧！蘊藏在服務社會人們的心坎里吧！才對。</p>
<h3>肺癆病人選擇滋養食物之標準</h3>
<p>— 鍾志和</p>
<p>肺結桃症（俗稱肺癆phthisis)係消耗病Wastinh　disease之一種。其因結核桿菌侵襲人體大施活動之結果。全身管養受其障碍。而患者遂日趨於消瘦贏弱。陷於憔悴衰孱之現象矣。此種情狀。若不急謀補救之方。維持方法。影響所至。勢必境况目下。而終必達于燈盡油乾。無術可以挽救之地步。吾人於斯。如欲設法補償其消耗。維持其營養。惟有選擇與攝取富含滋養食物之一途。然後庶可以言滋養療法也。</p>
<p>但病人如不加審愼。濫取食物。以求其體重之加增。消耗之補充。是不管將劣煤供機車之燃燒。結果徒使行車速率銳減。貽誤大事。由此可知。肺撈病人滋養食物之選擇。實為頗關重要之樞鉦。而當切實加以注意者也。兹將其標準。臄列於后。以供醫師與病家之參攷。——</p>
<p>（甲）牛乳</p>
<p>牛乳對於肺癆之功能。早為世人所熟知。八百年前Aretaeus氏己闡明其理。夫牛乳中含蛋自質之量極富。而其質量又頗佳。且其所供給之諸種阿米挪酸。（𠼞基酸）Ammino\Acid又為滋養上所必需之主要成分。故肺癆病人之滋餐食物中醫者每推荐之。</p>
<p>此外如脂肪鑛鹽類。及維生素等。牛乳中亦含量甚多。且甲乙丙三種維生素均有包涵。查牛乳一水磅。其在人體內供新陳代謝燃燒之價值。等於一磅之瘦肉。或八只鷄蛋。稱其為合乎標準而最輕濟之滋養食物。誰曰不宜。按尋常之病人。平均每日可食牛乳一磅至二磅。</p>
<p>在不易忍受生乳之病人。服後往往發生腹痛氣脹噯氣腹瀉等流弊。致令醫者每疑為潰瘍性腸炎。然在發生此稱症狀時。如令病人停進牛乳，則諸狀卽可減退或消減。或用鹽性溶液。如加入五分之一至五分之三的石灰水以稀釋之。亦可避免不消化症狀之呈現。有時與細米麥片或釆粥等調合而食之。似較易消化。</p>
<p>據Atwater氏之實騐。如牛乳單股。其消化之比例為蛋白質百分之九十二·二。炭水化物百分之八六。三·指肪百分之九二·八。但如和麵包同股。則消化力增強。其比例為蛋白質百分之九十七·一。炭水化物百分之九十八·七。脂肪百分之九十五也。</p>
<p>又牛乳中所含之鑛鹽類。其量亦不尠。均為肺癆患者每日滋養食物中。所不可或缺乏之主要成分耳。</p>
<p>（乙）鷄蛋</p>
<p>鷄蛋因其富含蛋自質脂肪及鑛鹽類等。在肺癆病人之滋養食物中。實佔極重要之地位。全卵含水份百分之七十五。蛋白質百分之十三。脂肪百分之十二。合計之則蛋白佔三分之二。卵黃佔三分之一。</p>
<p>全卵計重在五十克者。共滋養之值價。與牛肉三十五克或牛乳一百二十八克之滋養相等。卵黃含有脂肪百分之二十五。及蛋白質百分之十五。並核酸素Nuclein卵黃素Lecitine鐵及其他鹽類並胆脂素Cholesterin等。有強身補血之效。</p>
<p>每一磅之蛋白。能產生二百五十热力單位。Cnlor每磅卵黃能產生一千七百勢力單位。換言之卽每磅鷄蛋，其能產生七百以上之熱力單位也。</p>
<p>吾人深知常人如食服肪過多。結果每令肝臟充血。而食肉過多。則腎藏易起充血現象。倘食蛋過多。其害適與過食脂肪與肉類相等。</p>
<p>普通病人每喜食生鷄蛋。以為補力較大。但據研究所得。食生鷄蛋不易消化。甚或能惹起惡心嘔吐腹痛腹瀉等狀。凡蛋自質之熱度在攝氏三十七度者。易於消化。又病人如其胃肝之宜能紊亂。不易忍受鷄蛋者。則不可勉強其食鷄蛋。否則有損無益。决非醫者所願行。而病者所樂從者也。</p>
<p>偶有對鷄蛋具特異性者。雖食鷄蛋一枚。卽起腹部痠痛嘔吐或腹瀉等狀者。此為例外之現象。停食卽愈。可母恐懼。凡胃肝臟等官能之功用無紊亂者。每日可食鷄蛋四至六枚。收效卓著。</p>
<p>（丙）豆乳</p>
<p>豆乳（俗稱荳腐漿）由黃荳與水磨製而成。其為滋養品。吾國人早已熟知。决黃荳在一切穀類中。含有蛋自質最富。且其含量不亞於肉類。惟其中脂防甚少。故凡厭惡牛乳。或對牛乳其特異性者。可用以代替牛乳。肺癆患者每日除食牛乳外。仍可服豆乳一次。或兩次。亦屬價廉物美普遍經濟之滋養食物也。其所含成分之分析如下。</p>
<p>脂肪百分之二·五。</p>
<p>蛋白質百分之五·四。</p>
<p>炭水化合物百分之一·二。</p>
<p>水百分之九十·九。</p>
<p>（丁）蛋白質</p>
<p>肺癆病人因結核桿菌之作用。發生血中毒。Toxcemia毁滅與破壞人體之組織甚劇。其中尤以肌肉為最著。欲補償之。必需輸人適量之蛋自質。而後叫。大約體重每一公斤。每日需要蛋白質一·五克至一七五克。動物蛋向貿較植物蛋白質為佳。蓋動物蛋白質在人體。易起同化作用也。</p>
<p>肺結核患者。每日平均可食動物食物自四分之三至一磅。但最合宜而完備之食物。則莫加麵包一磅。（或米飯適量　鷄蛋三只。牛乳兩磅。四紅柿（蕃茹）八兩。新鮮蔬菜四兩。以及菓等。一磅之牛肉內含蛋白質約二三兩。一磅之鮮比目魚或繁魚含蛋白質一兩半至二兩半。</p>
<p>（戊）脂肪炭水化合物及鑛鹽類</p>
<p>脂肪亦為重要之滋養食物。其中當推乳酪牛奶油等為最佳。功效輿繁肝油相同。然進食則非所宜也。</p>
<p>炭水化合物。乃不可缺乏之滋養食物。蓋其在人體易於消化而起同化作用。</p>
<p>致於礦鹽類。如鐵鈣鈉鎂憐。為人體血腋興組織中極重要之元素可自各種食物中得之以滋養人體。</p>
<p>（己）維生素</p>
<p>維生素vitamins在十八以紀之末及十九世紀之初時。方為醫家所重視。一般研究學家。均以為滋養食物除蛋自質脂肪炭水化合物礦鹽類外。尚有更重要之滋養原素存於食物之中。而為人體康健所需要者也。公歷一九○五年Pekelharing氏。曾以乳酪蛋白米粉豬油水及監餵小鼠。結果小鼠雖有食物。但仍餓死。氏後以牛乳代替水分。小鼠皆活潑康健氏遂謂牛乳中必有不可思議之重要滋養成分。對於人體頗關聚要也。其後在公歷一九一二年。McCollum及Davis氏經實騐而發見甲種維生素。對於人生康健極有</p>

<p>重要之作用。倘缺乏該質。則人體易發生傳染症或染受傳染症。後經醫家之研究。則謂對於肺癆亦頗關重要。</p>
<p>至於乙種維生素。對於肺癆亦極有價值。蓋其在人體之運動神經具有特别之作用。據研究所得。謂肺癆患者如缺乏乙種維生素時。易患失眠症。且肺癆經過中病人常併發脚氣病。預後每多不良。故欲預防之。當多食富含乙種維生素之食物。</p>
<p>丙種維生素。爲普通强壯劑。在肺癆症用之有補益之功。Schraaedre氏曾證明患肺癆症時。必有丙種維生素缺乏現象。Hasselbach經種種檢查。更證明其説。謂肺癆症之咯血者。因毛細血管滲透性增加。故起輕度之咯血。或中等咯血及易於重發之咯血。多服丙種維生素可以减少出血。</p>
<p>丁種維生素。對於人體血液及骨質中之鈣質及燐質之吸收及新陳代謝之調整。極關重要。故肺癆病人服之。大有令肺損害處傾向於石灰化之性變。並促進與佐助其病勢之日趨於减輕矣。</p>
<p>夫多半之肺癆病人。其每日平均所需要之食物大約如下。</p>
<p>㊀蛋白質　一百克。</p>
<p>㊁脂肪　八十至一百克。</p>
<p>㊂炭水化合物　四百至五百克。</p>
<p>兹將滋養食物所含各種成分。及其供給之熱力列下。</p>

<h3>發展醫藥要使國人認識新醫藥（中）</h3>
<p>— 夏承道</p>
<p>至於説“舊醫有獨到之工夫”這便容易解答，亦是最要緊的關鍵，舊醫只知以藥治病，而不知治病藥品非絕對必須的，國人須知藥物治病，在治療中只佔一部分之位置，除藥物療法之外，尚有滋養療養法，水浴療法，寒冷療法，溫熱療法，氣候療法，礦泉療法，空氣療法氣壓療法，日光療法，高山療法，人工光綫療法，鐳錠療法，精神療法，輸血療法，等等言之不盡，種種療法，莫不是最巧妙最精確的科學產品，這豈是坐井觀天的舊醫夢想得到的嗎？所謂舊醫獨到處，這亦不過在藥物療法中，經過數千年之經騐，臂如當能止痛，大黃可下便，他們雖然不懂得是什魔道理，却也知道他的用途，是知其然，而不知其所以然也，孫總理中山先生説得好“知難行易，不知亦能行”舊醫知其然，就是舊醫無經騐之緣故，我國有數千年經騐的藥物，（所謂祕方及傳男不傳女的褲頭方亦在內），如能以科學的方法研究出來，對世界醫藥學，一定有很大的貢獻，國粹才能發揚，國家才有光榮！</p>
<p>舊醫治遺精病，必當補腎，言之眞可笑，舊醫以為精是來自腎臟，所以藥材店裏，補腎丸，固本丸，鬧得天花亂墜，而不知精來自精囊，因神經袞弱，管理精囊不週，以致精液容易遺流，腎是血液的濾缸，又是尿之產出所，卽所謂排洩器官是也，如患遺精而不治之，神經衰落之病源，專事補腎，眞是風馬牛不相及之事！</p>
<p>舊醫説“心主思想及知覺”，這又是笑話，他們又那裏知道心的作用，好像自來水公司的抽水機，一收一放，就把血液送到全身，主持血液之循環，凡此種種，全是根據多種實騐得來，若照舊醫的説法，腦部簡直是廢物了，他們何苦不把笨重壓在頭上的廢物的腦子挖去呢？</p>
<p>舊醫對自己人類各器官之作用，尚不能明明瞭，怎配做醫生？璧如一個修鐘表的工匠，他不明白鐘表之構造，和各部機件之作用，你一定不願把一個貴重的鐘表交給他修理的，偶或他會點一點油，鐘表因此能照跑，這是他一點小小的經騐，亦卽油之效用，這不算他有修理鐘表的技能！</p>
<p>綜而言之，舊醫的陰陽氣他玄談理論，完全是錯誤在此念六科學世界年，國人當去改正之，其數千年在藥物治療中到一部分的經騐，是有用的，換言之“中國本來無醫，祇有藥”，亦卽舊醫理論應當剷除，而中藥非特應保存，而且應當加以科學方法研究，而製造之，方能運出國門，以供世界治療之用。</p>
<p>數十年前的日本，醫藥界的情形，亦如今日我國一樣，更有甚者，提倡科學醫而被槍斃，卒因科學界之進步奮鬥，與國人能以國家整個之利益為目標，有遠大之眼光，能低首下心誠意接受世界的科學，用以建設國家，整理醫藥，全國上下一致，今日本的醫藥業，已擠在國際間的重要地位，與德英美爭雄矣，回顧我龍鍾老大國的國情，實令愛國之志士，傷心涙下不置！</p>
<p>國家之政治，能上軌道，須視國人之程度，及眼光如何，從來我國政府要人，自以為件件懂，事事談，門門能，無所不專，結果一無所專，兼職纍纍，結果只有担誤國事而己，國政務千頭萬緒，人雖為萬物之靈，然精神有限，時間有定，只有分工合作，分工越細事業越專，精紳益足，效率愈大，進步自速，富國強兵，才能早日如願達到，綜之現在已入訓政建設時代，應作精細工夫，換言之，在此建設時期，是須要用巧妙精細的工具——各科各類專門的人材，才能有名有實的，把國家從荒蕪之地建設起來！</p>
<h3>京滬蘇浙贛湘鄂等處衛生視察報告（二）</h3>
<p>— 儲晉芳</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>衛生事業，於近代國家，實為重要行政之一，因國際間之地位，往往有視一國民族之健康而衡定者。我國積弱已深，欲取得國際間之地位，非求民族之興盛不可。欲求民族之興盛，非先事衛生建設之完備不為功。</p>
<p>輓近歐美各國對於衛生事業，不獨政府倡導於前，人民亦多贊助於後。一過傳染病之發生，人民類都具有隔離，消毒，以及預防等常識，且能遵守衛生行政機關之指導，依法防範，故疾病率與死亡率，皆有顯著減低之現象。</p>
<p>我國年來對於衛生建設，雖積極推進，但尚未能普及。夫衛生事業，小則關於切身利害，大則繫乎民族之盛衰，實不容忽視而亟應講求者也。</p>
<p>本市市鄉各區，醫院與診療所，業已普遍設立，設備慚臻完備，惟尚偏重治療方面，對於病疫預防之設施上，如春季種痘及霍亂疫苗注射，每年雖免費施行，著有成效，但如婦嬰衛生，及健康教育等，尚待積極推進；為力求本市各項衛生設施之更為完善起見，自應博訪周諮，用資借鏡，此卽晋芳奉派视察衛生之主旨也。</p>
<p>此次視察地點，計经上海·杭州·鎮江·南京·南昌·九江·漢口·武昌·長沙等九處。以時間關係未能詳細考察；但於重要部份，均得窺見一斑。兹謹將視察情形，依行程之次序，繕具報告於後：</p>
<p>視察概况</p>
<p>上海</p>
<p>甲、市政府所屬機關</p>

<h3>統一與和平（再續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>或許又有人要問：以統一求和平是對的，不過要統一，一定要消滅割據的勢力，如果割據勢力不願消滅，一定要打仗，則其初爲和平而須統一，其繼爲統一而須打仗，這不是矛盾嗎？所以我再把統一與戰爭的關係加以説明。</p>
<p>再統一，須消滅割據勢力，那是毫無疑義的。用什麽方法來消滅呢？須知不一定用戰爭，也不一定不用戰爭；需要戰爭的時候則戰爭，不需要戰爭的時候則和平。所以要求和平，就要統一，這是一定的，而要求統一則不一定專用和平或專用戰爭。前一個「和平」是目的，後一個「和平」是方法。換言之，我們可以用和平的方法消滅割據勢力，完成統一，達到和平的目的；我們也可以用戰爭的方法消滅割據勢力，完成統一，達到和平的目的。</p>
<p>用戰爭的方法來消滅割據勢力，中外歷史上的例子很多，舉不勝舉。至於用和平的方法來消滅割據勢力的例子也未嘗没有。宋太祖趙匡胤做了皇帝以後，看見開國功勳的武將不免跋扈，深恐尾大不掉，形成割據，於是宴請各功臣一次，説動他們，把兵權交出來。這是歷史上有名的一段故事，叫做杯酒釋兵權。那就是用和平方法消滅割據勢力的例子。至於中華民國成立以來，那些軍閥割據勢力如何透漸消滅的呢？我可以説，民國十五年國民革命軍的出師北伐，伐什麽？就是伐軍閥。第一，伐吳佩孚，第二，伐孫傳芳，第三，伐張作霖。當時如果不出師北伐，請問這些軍閥割據的勢力何從消滅？所以説國民革命軍的出師北伐，就是用戰爭的方法以求統一，更藉統一以求和平。這種用戰爭的方法以求統一，有時是必要的，不過不一定專用此法罷了。孟子曾説「文王一怒而安天下之民，……武王亦一怒而安天下之民。」又説，「湯一征，自葛始，天下信之。東面而征西夷怨，南面而征北狄怨」。以成湯文武之聖，尚且不免用到戰爭來統一中國，那秦始皇以後歷朝的開創統一之局，更不必説是多少用到戰爭的了。乃現在少數有偏見的人，把以戰爭求統一稱爲「武力統一，」好像萬惡的，豈非遺忘了歷史，漠視了現實。平心而論，在民國十五年的時候，如果不出師北伐，如何可以消滅軍閥割據的勢力呢？所以到了必要的時期，用盡和平的方法還不能得到統一的時候，不得不用武力來戡亂，來討逆，來懲治破壞統一的罪人；否則要武力有什麽用？古今中外達到統一的途徑，可説祗有這兩條路：和平與戰爭。應該用和平的時候用和平；應該用戰爭的時候用戰爭。以素主「以德服人」的孟子，尚且對齊宣王説，「今王亦一怒而天下之民，民惟恐王之不好勇也，」又説，「今燕虐其民，王往而征之，民以爲將拯己於水火之中也，簞食壺漿，以迎王師。」可見戰爭並不一定是只許詛咒的事了。</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>印商方面準備收貨</p>
<p>本月紗高起二元半</p>
<p>空方交貨亦極努力</p>
<p>倉庫紗超出三萬包</p>
<p>遠期亦有鉅量套出</p>
<p>紗市遠期跌風陡熾、形勢虚弱、蓋以交貨籌碼充濫而挫、但二月期爲最後一幕、多方凖備掃數接收、故二月期獨漲二元半、惟遠月檯面大爲鬆懈、據市場言、多方收進之貨、在遠月巨量套出、以避危險、午後消息倉庫中解入已超出三萬包外、而有三萬三千包、其中有一千七百五十包、因收盤價小一元、業已抽回不交解、於是本月雖拉緊不放、遠月空方大活躍、市盤乃傾向下墮矣、但現紗客銷未衰、二月期標紗末盤價爲二百五十七元、比上月價漲四元云、</p>
<p>標紗近遠漲跌甚鉅</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、本月份爲最後一日交易、多空競爭愈見劇烈、空方雖努力交貨、然印商方面凖備巨量接受、故本月依然上漲二元、但遠月氣勢和平、二盤開拍、本月再漲一元、遠月反趨下挫、一般同業心思平淡、因解進倉庫之紗、已將近三萬包、於是對於遠月一致抛賣、壓力尤重、但現紗交易尚好、大阪三品紗亦回升二元七角至三元二角、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價跌九角至一元三四角、惟本月漲二元半、市場成交殊旺、至十二時半許遂告收盤、午後開盤、本月份市况仍昂、再漲五角、但遠月多方套出殊多而下跌、二盤以後、本月跌五角、遠月緩歩下降、以倉庫解進各紗、已達三萬二千包外矣、與上午收盤價標紗結果二月勿動、遠月再跌八九角至一元半、查賣出大孚二千五百包、通記二千三百包、錦昌二千九百包、賡豐一千二百五十包、大昌成一千包、長豐一千九百包、福康二千一百包、明德二千八百五十包、元一一千二百包、潤康二千八百五十包、信誠八百包、買進合興一千三百包、大豐一千三百五十包、聚興九百包、裕大一千七百包、振大一千五百五十包、大慶一千○五十包、長餘一千二百包、仁豐一千四百包、春昌一千六百包、森康三千包、均成一千○五十包、生源一千包、恒德九百包、吉豐八百包、愼記九百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>紗銷尚有二千餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚好、查全日各帮買去統計二千一百九十三包、售價與上日相仿、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>新籌碼大批交進</p>
<p>棉花浮多斬結尤夥</p>
<p>本月末盤跌至四二元六</p>
<p>棉市趨疲、且跌風殊盛、良以紗市下落、海外棉市不振、本月交貨新籌碼仍有四萬五千担、檢騐及格、廠方亦無收貨需要、於是人心尤挫、市盤乃歩瀉不已、本月跌破三元關口、末盤價爲四十二元六角、</p>
<p>各月跌半元餘</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月　致下降、且市勢異常衰弱、因本月期交貨籌碼充盈、棉花檢騐處審查及格之棉、新籌碼已有四萬五千擔、於是賣者益覺活躍、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均跌三角至四角半、午後開盤、市情依然不佳、且塲中浮多斬結尤衆、籌碼鬆濫、遠月跌風尤熾、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五分至二角、查賣出裕大九千担、同孚一千八百担、吉豐二千三百担、恒益六千九百担、振大二千四百担、豐春二千四百担、望泰興三千五百担、元一五千擔、福康五千擔、經華二千三百担、永大三千三百擔、信誠三千八百擔、長和四千二百擔、源興昌一千七百擔、森康一千八百擔、買進大孚　千三百擔、通記四千四百擔、聚興二千五百擔、大豐六千二百擔、泰興四千一百擔、愼昌二千八百擔、潤康六千九百擔、生源五千七百擔、同和五千八百擔、益昶二千八百擔、達記二千擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉消費平庸</p>
<p>廠胃不爽、來源亦未見云、</p>
<p>三品紗花所漲亦㣲</p>
<p>二十二日大阪電、現紗漲跌四至八元、十六支扇面二百三十二元、漲四元、二十支金魚二百五十三元、漲五元、四十支五星三百九十元、跌五元、四十二支雉子三百七十八元、漲八元、三品期紗漲一角五分至四角、近月爲二百四十三元九角、遠月爲二百四十五元五角、期棉漲三角至七角五分、近月爲七十三元八角、遠月爲七十五元二角五分、</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>乙種債劵下降最速</p>
<p>多頭回出連小四盤</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、爲本月份期貨最後之二日、市塲已恢復全日四盤交易、多空雙方、了結及掉期交易、較爲熱鬧、自四十五及四十六號兩家、將甲種賣小後、市氣即此不振、而本月份多頭、以乙種最爲擁擠、咸以抽籤紅票關係、多頭投機、集中一隅、故屆最後一二日、多頭出籠、亦以乙種下降爲最速、市價小四盤、形成軋多、今日爲二月份期貨最後一天、雖尚有傾軋、當亦無鉅大變動、惟畸形狀况、在所不免耳、昨日經過、上午開盤、初開三號十六及十一號買進、前列尚抬高一二角左右、後列轉小一二角左右、因五號及四十五·四十六號等仍有賣出、趨勢既變次盤即行不振、一致趨跌、大都續小二三角、午後開盤、多頭續有掉期、以六號爲最多、各債再小一二角至三角半、收盤散户雖有吸收、大户多頭掉期仍湧、本月乙種遽又小四角半、祗遠期甲種回上五分、結果一致趨跌、計小四五角至一元一角、成交總數、共計一千一百二十二萬五千元、兹將其漲跌結果、比較列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>金融</h3>

<p>後後開盤一一五五元半、大昌祥洽豐永恒餘售條、退至五元、慶發永天發同泰昌納條升至五元四角、鉅大天發再來覆出、又退至五元一角、同泰昌趁低維持、收盤爲一一五五元三角、一天間計有一元七角上落、結果下跌一元四角、</p>
<p>結價以中央銀行標凖價升爲一一五五元七角、照收盤價言約撳半元左右、本月份登賬一一五五元、三月份一一五六元、四月份一一五六元、上午補水一一五五元、現貨市况穩定、各烚赤照加十五元半、由同豐恒景福大豐恒等售予銀樓帮共　百餘兩、進價照加十二元、天津貨照加十四元、均無對做、掉期昨由多方慶發永與乾昌祥平掉二十一條、</p>
<p>場內交易平平、綜計春源永大豐恒同泰昌慶發永稍進、洽豐永元茂永生源永大昌祥恒餘鉅大略賣、三月份子剩一千九百二十五條、共計多方六家、空方十二家、四月期總數計三千九百四十八條、共計多頭二十四家、空頭十四家、成交總數計上午一百四十七條、下午二百十條、</p>
<p>公單前由空方景福解予洽豐、永四十二條、結價一一五六元、昨由空方乾昌祥三條解所、今日應由洽豐永收進之、結價一一五五元、本月份條子祇剩七條未淸矣、</p>
<p>供過於求外滙近遠均鬆</p>
<p>滙市昨因銀行胃口供過於求而趨硬化、晨初以海外電告、倫敦大條近遠俱平、紐約銀市停工、蒙得里遠期銀價微升五毫、倫敦生金漲半便士、英對美升一二五、英對法·英對日均平、美對英縮一二五、美對法跌○六二五、美對日勿動、中央銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、匯市晨開與上週六午收相同、開後華商稍塞、滙豐掛牌及白銀平衡税均平、此際銀行尚扒而略平、入後外商銀行紛紛塞出、美孚雖結、形勢仍鬆、幸有中國行家從中調劑、大勢尚稱平和、後市小吕宋電售少數美金、銀行胃口不振、形勢仍硬、中途銀行略有對做、市况尚盤、收盤近期賣價英滙一先令二便士五六二五、美滙二十九元六八七五、較前收計英鬆○三一二五、美滙硬○六二五、遠期亦然、銀行胃口不振、華商仍補東匯、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>各路現銷逐漸增加</p>
<p>當令各貨售盤均堅</p>
<p>昨布市續堅、蓋各路現銷均逐漸增加、同時青島布市較滬市爲尤佳、售盤高於滬市一角以外、致本埠青島貨細布細斜經天津帮不斷吸收、售價歩歩抬高、昨漲起每疋二分半至五分、滬貨亦帶高二分半、津帮成交五百餘包、本街進意較遜、成交近二百包、日商行家開貨寥寥、本廠貨細布·細斜梧州帮需要最旺、添辦五百餘件、廣州·汕頭等地吸胃亦濃、成交細布、漂布·細斜·粗布·條素府綢·嗶嘰·直貢·花布·色布等貨亦進四五百件、厦門·泉州·福州等帮均有起色、辦貨歩增、實以南洋市面漸轉景氣之故、此外長江流域·江浙內地·西北各區、現銷均有發展之望、因之滬埠存貨雖頗充盈、人氣仍佳、貨價當銷各貨售價均堅、跌價者惟落令各貨、然跌勢亦殊緩和云、</p>
<p>直貢嗶嘰暢銷特甚</p>
<p>國貨趨勢更爲優良</p>
<p>直貢呢目下走銷甚盛、本街客帮咸有需求、西貨到存甚缺、東貨雖有流通、但爲數亦少、致國貨乘機崛起、銷路大活、章華恊新二廠出品、幾有供不敷求之概、趨勢較其他毛織品爲俏、</p>
<p>素嗶嘰目前春銷及時、呢絨門市舖棉布莊及洋服帮等、均有大量進胃、國貨趨勢較東西貨爲優、因近年來由新運制服採製後、軍政學商多竭力提倡服用國貨、致市銷超過舶來品之上、交易節節增加、標凖行情尤見挺俏、其中以章華九一八及達隆一二八牌子、銷路尤廣、昨九一八元藏素嗶嘰母碼售三元零五分、一二八爲三元、草黄墨綠另加一角、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>廠套不暢麵粉跌後轉穩</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈一致回跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌一元零至一元一角、坎拿大跌六七八角不等、利物浦則祗小四分之一、當開價後、因洋麥跌風甚盛、人心當然不穩、本月份開價曾跌至四元零二三分、三四月份亦較跌四五分不等、七月份新以籌碼較稀、祇小二三分、二盤以下、本月份廠方補進、市面轉穩、遠期廠方套售不暢、業外微有收進、市氣亦見回挺、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、比較轉淸、市呈盤旋、據業中人之推測、往後如實銷通暢、洋麥又難確合、故看平定之勢云、</p>
<p>內地帮收買近遠期麥</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份呈先跌繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、雖回跌六七八角至一元一角不等、惟以陳麥而言、一時尚未合劃、新麥則更難合、且本月份因有津帮之吸住、市氣比較穩固、故開價祗小四分、旋即四上、三月份以下、因抛户甚寂、亦祗小一二分至三五分、迨至下午開盤、以粉市略穩、內地帮對近遠期均有收買、因此市氣甚穩、回漲三五六分、至結果反好一二三分、現麥市面、因標凖回振、廠胃亦佳、微好三四分、開洋河麥六元六角、次之一角半、蚌埠麥六元六角、江北紹興黄橋天台麥六元五角半、南京麥六元五角三分、由福新辦三千包、申大辦二千包、阜豐辦二百五十包云、</p>
<p>粤方辦機糙米甚旺</p>
<p>昨日客秈客化仍旺、尤以粤帮貪辦糙米與機晚最見活潑、粤帮在前昨兩日間已辦去機糙各米五萬包、本街汕厦北洋西安各帮兩日間亦去二萬多包、市面急轉直上、回好三角至四角不等、如今後粤化不絶、後市或須繼續上展、昨日所開各米四萬多包、粤帮所去占三分之二、因此人心多見激昂、雖長江來源不絶、而貨主依然有喊高之表示云、</p>
<p>油豆餅得連市之助</p>
<p>昨日標凖油豆餅市、上午以連電升降不多、市面仍居平局、祗標豆被現貨滯銷與存積影響、近月回小五六分、及午後突接連電激漲之消息、標油有補空與外行問津、價乃逐盤上抬、收市較大四五角、標餅亦好一分許、標豆雖大連回漲甚健、然以現化淸淡、既乏客化、車廠亦呆、而連地大票堆積久乏出路、亦有搬運南下之説、故人心仍虚、結果近月好一分、遠期好三分云、</p>
<p>薄稻津帮稍有動辦</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、較前稍多、共到有四十餘號、貨約八千一二百石、內薄稻占二十餘號、而客帮包胃仍屬不爽、雖有天津秦皇島帮辦去薄稻二千餘包、然吃盤奇苛、致薄稻猶難振作、僅高料貨勉告平定、中段貨悉貶角許、厚粳到貨殊屬不旺、然本街銷塲殊滯、致行情仍呈定中帶軟之局、惟聞客尖市價驟漲二角、粳市未免有被帶好希望、預料今日市况或可暫趨穩定耳、杜洋尖及陰變兀均無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源約廿二三號、市上各貨銷路淸淡、頂白粳價疲軟、中次者短小數分、薄稻積貨豐厚、價又小七八分、早稻到貨見湧、去胃平淡、價小近角、羊秈因售江西秈影響、價連小一角、埠杜尖亦軟五六分、其餘均帶軟勢、惟變元銷路尚可、價回漲六七分、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>南江青開升三角</p>
<p>昨洋糖趨勢平平、國産青糖仍見緊秀、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨二十二元九角、轉口七元半、均乏更動、東白惟八號現貨小五分、爲二十二元六角、餘持原價、本廠綿白亦乏軒輊、號貨有潮帮開出冲提青百餘包、十四元四角、廣帮開出海南洋數十包、十四元二角、又南江青二百餘包、十四元三角、比升三角、又北海片青七十餘件十一元、建帮開出漳刁青百餘包、十三元六角、又泉州片青數十包、十一元六角、比升二角、</p>
<p>合組公司昨爲本週第一次標兑粤糖之期、計總定額爲、四七二五包、標價仍舊、當售出順德廠五羊粗白六○包、二十二元八角、東莞廠又一六○包、二十二元八角、惠州中砂白二十元、未成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>中檔桂圓存底軋缺</p>
<p>中檔桂圓、近乏續到、市存亦缺、故漲度較高、並據泉州電訊、中粒亦云乏貨、未肯抛兑、可見各處均感軋缺、後市當有續升之望、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>內外絲銷尚難轉機</p>
<p>昨日海外絲市、紐約星期休業、横濱則呈微漲、現貨八八三元、漲三元、期貨八四八元、漲九元、里昂無變動、本埠絲市、廠商心理堅好、對外發電之價亦高、故成交不多、用户方面、綢廠大致尚未開工、交易亦寥若晨星、日前絲市、趨向頗屬平庸、內外絲銷一時尚難暢展去、</p>
<p>華茶出口無須派司</p>
<p>我國運銷海外紅綠茶、政府爲提倡國貨外銷起見、完全免税、但爲鑑别銷售內外計、向均有派司之設置、去年皖贛紅茶運銷委員會成立該會總經理程振基氏洞悉其詳、認爲出洋紅綠茶、既與內銷毛茶、有箱簍之别、商人持用此項派司、障礙滋多、爰經呈請上峯咨行財政部、轉知關務署令飭廢除、聞已正式批准、嗣後出洋箱茶、省却種種手續云、</p>
<h3>雜項</h3>
<p>大批日貨源源而來</p>

<h3>生與死</h3>
<p>— （黄偉玲）</p>
<p>生，是不是快樂的？死是不是痛苦的？許多人都探求這個問題。但都找不到正確的解答。</p>
<p>我們離開一切的學理，離開一切的哲學，事實已很淸楚的告訴我們：生既不能斷定是快樂的或痛苦的，同樣，死，也不能斷定是痛苦的或快樂的了。</p>
<p>但，這僅是時間上的問題，我們其實可以這樣説：當我們生在不應當生的時候，生是痛苦的。同樣，當我們死在應當死的時候，死是快樂的；當我們死在不應當死的時候，死是痛苦的。</p>
<p>如老年臨到了我們，我們應當死了，我們應當快樂的死！正義與責任逼廹着我們，我們應當死了，我們也快樂的去死！但老年離我們還很遠，我們就要積極去求生，爲了正義，爲了責任，我們更應去求正當的生。</p>
<p>應生的生是快樂的，應死的死也是快樂的，我們爲免除不應當的死而去求生，我們爲求生而去就正當的死。</p>
<p>自己的生死，握在自己的手裏！</p>
<h3>時髦的傀儡</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>説來慚愧！在上海飄泊了八九年，對於最時髦的電器燙髮，還不曾目覩過。原因很簡單，因爲我的貴處是鄉村。爲了剪一次髮特地跑到上海去，實在不便，而且也不經濟。昨天因事至法租界某馬路，恰巧髮兒已急待了；爲了有碍容顔起見，遂在一家雙開間門面的理髮所裏修理一下。真可説無獨有偶！這時正有一位女郎在電器燙髮呢！壓在我心頭已久的奇蹟，終於是給我發現了。那隻斗大的燙髮器具，籠罩在伊的頭上，把天然的頭髮串在器具內每一個的橡皮管中，等到電門一開，頭髮立刻跟着轉動起來。令我驚奇！令我慘不忍覩！暗想這和受電刑的犯人有何區别？假如那架器具一毁，殺那間就有生命的危險！爲了時髦而願去受這般活刑，真不合算。無怪有人説：「人表面雖是個萬物之靈的高等動物，其實却是個大呆子」。這話不無相當理由吧！</p>
<p>由於燙髮，又不禁使我聯想到爲時髦寗願犧牲一切的活劇來：在嚴寒的冬天，人們穿了棉袍和棉鞋，尚不覺暖，但是一般摩登娘兒們，身上還是披着夾旗袍，足上還是穿着絲襪和挖空的高跟鞋呢！難道伊們是銅皮鐵骨的而不怕冷嗎？那無非爲着時髦吧了。同事穆君，善跳舞，據他説某舞女，因爲嘴唇塗了口紅，以致飲食大感不便，終而减少了些。足徵爲了時髦，對於人生，最重要的吃，也會加以顧忌了</p>
<p>漢奸求名利，竟做了某方的傀儡，上海人求時髦，却不啻做了時髦的傀儡呀！</p>
<h3>副業漫談</h3>
<p>— 焦士潔</p>
<p>在正當職業之外，再要操副業，無非爲了想多得一些錢，補助用途，俗所稱爲「撈外快」者是也。</p>
<p>如果一個女子，譬如正當職業是女招待，而人家説伊是另操副業的，並且是不正當的副業，那意思就是以女招待爲名，而操神女生涯是實，這樣，伊實際上的生活是正副顛倒，因爲正業伊到没法可以生活，副業的進益倒反較多呢！於是到底孰是正業，孰是副業，也就無從説起了。</p>
<p>有的人爲了副業，反而躭誤了正業，所以普通的一般商人們，就不能兼職，不容有操副業的存在了。</p>
<p>有副業的人大概總是閑暇的，没有閑暇的人也就無暇去營副業的了。現在無綫電普遍後，新副業多了許多。</p>
<p>一個名伶，除登台唱戲外，灌留聲機片就是另一筆收入，無綫電裏播音，也是多一宗收入，這都是副業。文人可以買文賣字，可以上播音台去教書，講故事，會吹吹口琴的也可播音，能説説笑話的，唱唱曲調的，甚至會呌的狗，善鳴的鳥，也可以去播播音。（外國就有如此的。）於是副業途徑，平添了不少，有許多人，當副業有成就，勝過了正業時，副業就成了正業，兼職成了主職，不見許多人是在靠播音度活了。</p>
<p>本來，能够兼職的是唯有雄才大略者。可是現在很多人做了××會長，兼做××主席，這些兼職的人，與其説兼職，不如，直截地説副業，究其所以要操副業者，又無非想多賺些錢罷咧！</p>

<h3>示翠兒并寄立春日之柳花一掬</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>今年祀竈節，大寒已早過，恰巧遇立春，天氣乍暖　，（上聲）室恥計温表，升至六十五，侵晨畫眉啼，旭日滿庭樹，起來剛正卯，倐忽已當午。本與家人約，快車到黄浦，乃被凍瘃累，一足不能舉，雖能扶杖行，然而亦痛苦，我原在故鄉，豈曰歸期阻，開我池上軒，把酒面塲圃，寒虀正開甕，糉子亦已裹，所惜牙齒衰，且不如爾母。爾母長於我，六十慶初度，立春爲歳首，其製創於古，防老乃養兒，數典莫忘祖。汝年小一年，年氣方虎虎，勿學老年人，宜學小兒女，笑語白生春，勝用參求補，烏猶反其哺，羊則跪而乳。汝兄謀自立，自立其門户，汝弟太樸厚，訥訥不能語，孫兒恃嬌寵，動踂用其武，弱妹詎能甘，膚受則必愬。王母方一笑，亦復爲一怒，小婢猶痴憨，日高猶懶臥，每與竈下養，呶呶起齟齬，我願東廚司，一一施夏楚，直奏到天庭，勿向我告訴。我固怕煩惱，不願爲家主，因而有三窟，生肖本爲兎，聽之若罔聞，視之若無覩，醒則自蘧蘧，夢則常栩栩，既不論榮辱，亦不計毁譽。兒勿學古人，但須學爾父，有事皆當爲，無事不可恕，撫躬嘗一笑，提筆每四顧，祇覺天地寛，莫遣韶光誤，風静樹亦寗，椿萱賴維護。不觀西湖柳，初春已飛絮，簾攏罥輕紗，無端竟吹絮，寄與卜奇詫，爲索謝庭句，猶恐老眼花，或者是認錯，緘入玉璫中，聊以樹遲暮。（附柳絮？一包）</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>夢蘭道：當真有病嗎？怎麽我一點影子也看不出來，二少奶道：你是聰明一世，糊塗一時，你想，母親那樣疼愛你的人，他可肯讓你知道他身上有病？當你走近他身邊的時候，他立刻就打起全副精神翥，對着你不笑也笑，不説也説，你没有知道他的心事，你怎麽知道他身上會暗藏着有病呢？夢蘭聽到了嫂嫂這樣的報告，臉上立刻加了一番沉鬱之色，而且把身子坐得更端正些，表示他對於這件事的注意。這就望了二少奶問道：父親知道這件事嗎？二少奶道：也許略微知道一點影子，但是母親决不肯把真話告訴父親的。因爲父親要知道母親有病，一定會勸他吃藥的。夢蘭道：當然，誰也不願吃藥。可是良藥苦口利於病，非吃不可。母親縱然瞞着，兩位少奶奶，也可以在父親面前，透露一點口風。二少奶點點頭道：姑娘，你怎麽還是没有明白呢？母親並非是有什麽風寒虚食的病，他那個病，心裏藏有許多疙疸呢。你不把那疙瘩解了，只管教他喝苦水，那有什麽用？夢蘭道：據二嫂説起來，這情形倒是厲害得很！二少奶隨了這話，也把眉頭皺起來，因道：嚴重是没有什麽嚴重，不過老人家心裏總透着不大舒服似的。我想着，妹妹若是勸勸他老人家，那或者他心裏要寛慰一點。夢蘭道：何以我就能勸解呢？他説着這話，臉上可多增加了一層紅暈。二少奶也曾把眼睛朘了他一眼，但是態度很鎭静，微笑道：這個你有什麽不明白的？作娘的人，總是和自己的姑娘親近些，你若是能在老娘懷裏打上兩個滾，當然老太太心裏，就歡喜起來了。夢蘭心裏一塊大石頭，方才落了下去。因道：我以爲你説我有什麽靈丹妙藥，可以治老娘的病，原來就説的是這個。這個法子，無論我這麽大的人，不好意思做出來，就算好意思做出來，那也不過暫時引他老人家笑上一笑。要是母親有什麽心病，俗言道得好，心病還要心藥醫。二少奶倒是微笑了一笑，並没有把這話跟着説下去。夢蘭説過了那句話，也是默然的坐着。樓梯板咚咚一陣響，小菊兩隻手在懷裏操着，却捧住了四個碟子。二少奶道：你看這孩子做事，不是找駡挨嗎？四個碟子，怎好一下捧了上樓？（一三六）</p>
<h3>老馬脱厄記</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>一九二七年英戍軍之拔隊離滬也，軍中有駿馬一，服役有年，嘗建戰功，全軍贈以「老馬」之名，愛之綦甚。因不忍再使涉重洋，受長征之勞頓，乃與他馬數頭，分贈滬市某外團，而與約曰：「無論若何，不得鬻之。」方期「老兵」從此可安享其生，如戰士之解甲歸田然，不意其竟因是備受磨折，苟非及時獲援，則必委於溝壑而莫知其所終矣。蓋其新主人忘約言，或故失信，初以「老兵」供貰役，繼復鬻之龍飛拍賣塲，得資八十金。「老兵」於是乃入閘北卑暗之廐，服賤役，此其往年昻首馳驅軍中，主人愛之若友，其情况不啻霄壤之殊，「老兵」若有知，感慨當何如耶？一九三五年六月，滬市外人所設之護畜會偶於閘北郊外發見「老兵」之蹤跡，憐其晚境之鈍蹇，擬備價購回，商未妥，「老兵」復易主人，而爲龍華某漂白廠所有矣。且其遭遇每况愈下，至是雖年逾二十，而仍曳重載，奔波無寗日，車既笨拙，道復崎嶇，時或遠適松江，往往於鞭撻之下，喘汗大作，求死而不可得。去年護畜會復念及「老兵」，覔其所在，而往購之。至則見「老兵」繫蓆棚中，皮骨僅存，且已跛其一足，病幾斃已。棚之二面敞開，餘二面亦微以雜物爲蔽，地鋪草少許，泥濘汚穢，不可名狀，使「老兵」能言者，必將涕泣而訴其苦况矣。「老兵」雖幾無用於主人，而主人仍居奇昻索值，會故窘於資，備費唇舌，至古曆新年，始妥購，而寄飼於阿斯考特騎校。該會切望愛馬之士，或歐戰中曾與戰馬有關之軍人，慷慨解囊，使「老兵」獲生活資，以盡其餘年，聞月有十金，即足矣。該會初以「老兵」病甚，擬以合於人道之法斃之，俾解其痛苦，「刑者」奉命赴騎校，見「老兵」既獲温飽，精神復振，安處廐中，怡然自得，遂不忍下手而返。吾因是憶及昔田光先生告燕太子之言曰：「臣聞騏驥盛壯之時，一日而馳千里，至其衰老，駑馬先之。」馬焉如是，人焉亦然。然苟遇得其主，則縱衰老寡能，其主人必念其盛壯之出力，而善遇之如故。不則將不免如「老兵」之遭遇，憔悴至死，此所以英雄末路，每仰天椎心而泣血也。然使「老兵」盛壯之時，碌碌無功，則至絶境，誰復憐而援之。他馬老年，如「老兵」之遭遇者多已，未聞有得援而脱厄者。古語曰：「少壯不努力，老大徒悲傷，」誠至言也。</p>

<h3>談曆（上）</h3>
<p>— 曹義璇</p>
<p>觀測地球與其他天體的關係，可以預知未來氣節的變遷，推算一切的時令，逐日記載簿上，能使人類生活有正確順序的依據者，謂之曆。曆有陰曆與陽曆，以月的盈虚爲凖則，把太陰（月）一次運行地球的時間爲基礎的，謂之「太陰曆」，亦稱陰曆，如摩哈默德曆，中國曆，希臘曆，印度曆，巴維龍曆，猶太曆等是。上古時代，人類的生活，與月的運行很有密切的關係，就是現在對於潮汐的漲落與輪船交通上，尤爲重要，所以陰曆直到今日，還不能廢除。後來發明以太陽爲活動的中心，就是以地球繞行太陽（日）一周的時間爲標凖，合計爲三百六十五日五時四十八分四十六秒餘，除去零數，定三百六十五日爲一年，其零數過了四年爲二十三時十五分餘，作爲一日，加入第四年的閏，如此至四百年祇有三日。然而地球實際的運行，比曆面爲遲，所以爲防免起見，除去西洋紀元數四的年，作爲閏年，又西洋紀元數的終，以附二個零的年，用四百除去的年爲閏年，没有除去的年爲平年，用這陽曆的，有埃及曆，波斯曆，猶里烏斯曆，及現在世界所用的葛雷哥里阿曆。陽曆的起源，是在紀元前七百五十年以前羅馬的羅爾姆司王時代，其後經過種種改良，行至今日的。我們過了一日又一日，並没有什麽特别的感觸，可是二月的二十八日，七八月的三十一日等，每日的日數，多不平均，在二十八日與三十一日的月，有四個星期日，靠月薪度日的人，除了四個星期日，祇有二十四日與二十七日，所以曆的不備，應當加以改良的。然而曆法的改良，在百五十年以前，已成爲問題，主張合理主義與破壞傳統的法國革命鬬士，對於二月的二十八日，反對固烈，而且對於曆及時很有關係的羅馬，也從根本上爲其打破。他們主張以十時間爲一日，時間爲百分，廢週用旬，以一個月爲三十日，所餘五日，附在年底，其中最有趣者，把秋分立在年始，就以此日爲王政廢止宣言的紀念日，稱爲共和曆，此曆竟施行十三年，其後覺到太不合理，始行廢止，然而現行的葛雷哥里阿太陽曆，仍舊是不完全，雖經四百年的改良，尚不適當，其中反被改惡，就是以日與年爲自然單位，週爲人工單位，反來覆去，總没有想出優秀的改良方案。一九二三日國際聯盟注意改正曆法，特設調查委員會，一九二七年通告各國政府，希望調查研究曆法。後來得到二個改良方案，一個爲實證哲學的元祖奥格司德康德的十三個月案，案以週爲單位，合四週二十八日爲一個月，十三個月三百六十四日爲一年，因此平年剩下一日，閏年餘下二日，把這餘剩的日爲週外的日，放在年始，或年終。因把年頭的第一日，定爲星期日，那未，其餘，月，亦可以類推了。這是曆日與星期日相結便利的點，不過安分一年爲二或四，那是不便了</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“阿比西尼亞”在“上海”</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>“阿比西尼亞”影片在上海，起先是因抗議而停映，經中央電檢會把該片吊回，重行愼重檢查，並且把共中激烈部份剪去之後，又重行通過發下到上海公映了。這樣謹愼從事的結果，原以為是可以平安無事的過去的，結果可不然，反響還是有，並且是更激烈，木棍手槍之外，還有阿摩尼亞等“文明武器”：有這樣的武器，自然不必再大兜其圈子，來上什麼外交手續，“武力卽權力”，用武力力把認為可惡的東西一陣子搗毀，豈不快哉！何況，眞的阿王到現在雖己英雄末路，阿國的民衆到現在雖已在文明“統治下過着生活，而銀幕上的阿王，於阿國民衆却選是那麽慷慨激昂的圖謀不軌，這於“文明”的意國，豈不“國體有關”？用對阿比西尼亞野蠻民衆的手段同樣地來對“阿比西尼亞”影片者，那眞所以以示薄懲，而告訴人們説，意大利的“灌輸文明”的手段，現在還依舊有着也。這手段不僅切實地施行於阿國的國土，並且還將切實地施行於抗戰的阿國人民影子所到的地方。</p>
<p>這樣“文明”的“偉舉”自然是使我們瞠目驚嘆不置。可遺憾的却是這樣“文明”的“偉舉似乎還不夠偉大，偉大得使人懾服，例如意水兵在上海宣揚文明的前日，阿比西尼亚京城亞第斯亞貝城，“卽有不滿意國統治之阿比西尼亞人，混雜羣衆之中，拋擲手溜彈”，將前往教堂慶祝意國王孫那波利斯親王誕生的意國重要官員多人炸傷；而在上海，事情將會有怎樣發展，現在固然還未可逆料，然而提出抗議將是必然的，可見也並不能就此太平。</p>
<p>關於提出抗議的，虹日區市民會各區分會已經在聯名函請市聯總會轉呈市政府及外交部駐滬辦事處，要求“從嚴交涉，保證不得再發生同類情事，藉重社會洽安”了：中央方面呢，現在還尚無下文，但為了中央電檢會的威信計，我相信不久之後是也一定會將抗議提出的。上海大戲院以及其他各有關方面，也勢必一定會呈請中檢會主持公道。但是抗議提出以後又如何呢？我𫗻意靜待着看。</p>
<p>事情不是一紙抗議就算結束；“保證不得再發生同類情事，藉重社會治安”更是太抽象的説法：侵犯我主權，侮辱我國體，這些自然是目前至重且大的問題！而更實際而亟須解決的，則是中央電檢會的威信問題，如果經過中央通過的影片可以這樣隨便了結，叫試問以後舶來影片不服審查起來又如何辦理？</p>
<p>所以，為了表示中央電檢會的威信，並以事實來保證起見，我以為，在抗議的絛文中，應該有一條此次審查通過之“阿比西尼亞”影片，以後得不受任何限制在中國領士內繼續開映”並且，為了這不是具文，在交涉解决之日，就以原片在上海或其他各地公映。</p>
<h3>水車夫</h3>
<p>— 張浩瀑</p>
<p>照例，護國寺的喇嘛一敲鐘，轤轆手歪脖子老六就起來咧。他的動作是很輕悄，為的是怕驚醒那些正睡得香甜的水車夫。自己一個人把火爐生着，灌一壺水坐上，然後自己再穿套褲，紥襪腿。最後他拿了小油瓶，替每個車夫把車芯子和車耳子加上油。於是大聲的唱兩句“法門寺”劉僅的嗓門，把水車夫都嘓醒。火爐上的水壺唧唧的呵着，水將開的時候，大家都起來了！抽烟，洗臉，𤌄包脚布。歪脖子獨自開水糟蓋，他跟馬車夫“大個孫”説話兒，這兒，天天早晨最先來的是“大個孫”，牽着兩匹棗紅馬來飲。</p>
<p>生活死板而又平凡，痛苦在身上打了深深的烙印。他們麻木的度着艱困的日子，不知道如何改善生活，更失去了美滿生活的慾望。回憶到過去，他們甚至感到現在的日子還很幸福呢？從前黃河發大水，沖沒他們的房屋，田畝，耕牛，連父母妻子也都死的死，散的散。自己逃到遠處當了兵，心想當兵有個發達，可是吃過幾次仗，升官發財的不是自己而是那些長官，失望之後，不得不拚着性命“開小差”，這當兒總算有了飯門，每月還撈個三塊五塊，保住這飯碗吧，痴心妄想是解不了饑渴他們完全馴馴服服的做井主人的奴隸，替井主人賺了無数的錢，而他們所得到手的寶在少得可憐！井主人兇殘得恨，北京入都呌他們是“水閥”，因為他們往往跟吃水的人家爭吵，打架，提高水價。其實吃苦的祇有水車夫們！成年沒有一點空間，牛馬似的不停的工作着，一有差錯就被歇工。</p>
<p>頂辛苦的要算是轤轆手歪脖子了！他不會吃烟，也從木休息，放下轤轆就照管火爐，做饭，洗衣服，替水車夫們釘鞋！他簡直是車夫們的母親·誰都親熱的對待他，他也和氣的愛護著每個伙伴。雖然他比別人多掙兩塊錢，可是他拿出來大家化，比仿買小菜啦，買冰糖萌蔗啦，總之那比別人多掙的兩槐錢通通化在別人身上。他已是四十多歲的人</p>
<h3>直搗黃龍</h3>
<p>— 巨無霸</p>
<p>用强大的兵力，直搗黃龍，殺滅匪盜，可稱一大快事。</p>
<p>淋病初起時，每因誤服劣藥，及洗滌不愼之故，致病菌摧入尿道深處，侵及睪丸，因而睪丸發炎，尿道漲痛，猶如刀裂。</p>
<p>新藥“的立平”，其各種成分聯合之力量，能將頑強負嵎深入尿道之淋菌，殺滅凈盡。同時對於炎腫之結膜上，又能發揮其消炎，收歛，鎭痛，清濁之功，絕對不碍胃腸，不害腎臟，不具其他任何副作用，此在內服淋病藥之中，可稱為要最完善之製劑，逈非他種普通膚淺之藥，所能比擬。</p>
<p>服“的立平”新藥，直搗黃龍，殺滅淋菌，也是一大快事。</p>
<h3>婦女講座</h3>
<p>— 胡慧珍</p>
<p>虛弱的原因</p>
<p>我們一般婦女，因為運動不足，所以體弱；因為深居簡出，所以鬱悶；因為信水月至，所以血虧：因為養育兒女，所以疲勞，這就是婦女虛弱的幾個大原因！</p>
<p>在我國更甚</p>
<p>婦女比較男子，身體容易弱，精神容易衰，氣血容易𧇊，形容容易老，疾病容易侵，這在我國的環境底下，比較更甚！</p>
<p>補救的方法</p>
<p>補救婦女虛弱的辦法，除改良生活外，並宜調服健身的藥品。我有許多女友，她們自調服五洲製劑“女界實”後，她們以前種種的病態都消失了，所以我認為這是婦科的妙藥呢。</p>

<p>了，没娶過老婆，據他自己説從生下來他没跟女人睡過覺。有時别人講起娘兒們，他也挺動心，如果你問他：“歪脖子怎麽樣？想討老婆不？”他會嘴着牙笑一笑，又去摇他的轤轆。呱嗒呱嗒，無窮盡的生活都在轤轆上溜走了。</p>
<p>歪脖子把窩窩頭蒸好，切了鹹蘿葡頭，再倒點醋和醬油把鹹蘿葡頭拌了。等到水車夫都陸續回來，就開始吃早飯。一天三頓飯都是一模照樣，窩窩頭就鹹菜。</p>
<p>到天傍黑的時候加倍的忙起來，車夫們都心急手急，恨不得一時手上長手，脚上生脚。這會子的活計頂難幹！白天街道上的爛泥湯上凍了，凍得不結實，脚踏上去就成個窩兒。特别的裝滿一肚子水的車身，總是深軋在泥淤中，走起來異常費力，車夫們個個滿頭大汗，眼梁蓋上冒着熱氣，用了全身的力量對付車子。最難走的是没有完全凝凍的爛泥路，脚一扎不住根就得給滑倒翻了車便會摔傷自己，至少得滚一身爛泥。回來井主人凖得向你大駡一頓，你向誰訴寃呢？</p>
<p>每到眼藏黑兒，護國寺廟院中的年老古槐上就聚着一羣烏鳥，牠們在冷悄悄的屋中咭呱的悲呌，不知牠們是在替水車夫們嘆息，還是牠們的手飛舞着，長炳的水杓在手中迅速的擺動，一歇兒工夫就灌滿一車水。歪脖子這功夫也忙下，水槽里的水淺了又深，深了又淺，可是歪脖子自來不受車夫埋怨，他没有一次使水糟空過，井主人也誇讚過他這手活計幹得好。</p>
<p>可惡的是那些吃水的人家，越在忙的當口他們越來催的緊：“小温！趕快去倒呵！打早起没倒過！”誰也没工夫理會這些，祇是落水車，任兩膊如何酸痛，也得咬着牙根挨下去。車一灌滿，丢下大水杓就推車走。</p>
<p>夜色籠罩了這古城時，水車夫都推着空車子回來啦。把車子往地上一豎，除掉水箱上的木塞，讓殘留的水漬都空出來。抽口烟後，每人都從腰里陶出小錢口袋，數着錢數，計算妥當之後，再一五一十的交給井主人。等井主人帶着錢提着鳥籠子走了，他們一窩蜂的積到火爐邊，坐在小板凳上脱濕透了鞋和包脚布。</p>
<p>一揭開籠屜，窩窩頭冒着熱氣，每人都搶過一個放在手里暖手。歪脖子替他們倒了開水。洗完了手便動手吃飯。慢慢的渾身酸痛起來，疲乏在身上發酵了！一個個像黑熊似的跌在床上，閉上眼就睡着，任什麽聲音也攪不醒。歪脖子去拾這，整理那，直到别人統統睡着，賣“硬麵餑餑”的扯着嗓子喊過大楊家胡同，他才上床去睡。</p>
<h3>查夜</h3>
<p>— 弭藍</p>
<p>——瀋陽之什</p>
<p>夜，黑得像漆一樣。雖不下雨，可是有惡意的風在外面鼓得起勁。這一條日間非常吵鬧的街道，現在也浸在深厚的黑暗里。遠近祇有釘了鐵的皮鞋和槍托敲擊着路板的聲音，倉皇而驟急地𦂧動……</p>
<p>連續這幾天來，不知為些什麼，友軍們抓人的風炽，突然又比平常嚴緊起來。於是，這座古老喧囂的瀋陽城，整個濛在紊亂和恐佈的氛圍里。</p>
<p>晚上，六點鐘一敲過便開始戒嚴了祇要你一踏出門，隨地有武裝的軍人攔住了你去路，把槍對你腰叉裝着攻擊式，細細地還搜着你身邊的東西。……</p>
<p>為了這樣，我每近傍晚，就躲進自己房中，縮緊脑袋鑽在被窩里。但是我的屋子非常地狹窄，我整天限制在這里面，感到氣悶和窒息。有時，我祇把靠街那面窗子推出一條縫隙來，換換空氣，順便也窥探着外面的情景。但所見到的，是些褐色的軍用車輛，褐色的武裝軍士，和他們肩上亮閃閃的槍械……這些，更添加了我混身的顫慄！</p>
<p>如此已是四個晝夜了。突然那天的暮近，從茶役六福那里傳來一個消息，據説今天晚上他們還要挨戶來“查夜”。</p>
<p>查些什麼呢？——我招呼六福進來，這樣底問他。他也解答不出來只把一雙憤恨的目光投在我臉瞠上。</p>
<p>“這批傢伙眞蠻不講理。……“這麼説着：他又很快地搖搖頭。“簡直當我們這兒老百姓是匹好欺的猪！”</p>
<p>他退出房去的時候，還太息了一口長氣。</p>
<p>我直望着他後影楞了一會，回過頭來隔窗凝視着：窗外，夜仍在越展越深的黑暗里無聲地爬行。街道上，一切的饗動，也清清楚楚送進我的耳內。……！</p>
<p>隔不到一刻工夫，猛地六福掀進門來，攣轉着腰背，他換了一副驚慌的嘴臉湊近我耳邊低聲地説：</p>
<p>“外面……外面××人來查夜了”</p>
<p>“已進來了嗎！”我一怔，臉上似乎有些發燒，我問：“有幾個人啊，”</p>
<p>“人很多哩！”六福蹙緊着眉際對我望望，隨又安慰着我道：“不要紧的，現在，現在還在樓下，不過你快把書籍收拾一下，因為書籍最多麻煩……”</p>
<p>説完，他便匆匆地走出去了。</p>
<p>這回我的心兒又像吊了起來。但我竭力鎮定着，勉强把箱龍整顿了一下，加了鎖。雖則我沒有帶了什麼，然而我怕受意外的麻煩！</p>
<p>樓梯上接着一陣雜亂的腳步，由遠而近，漸慚又停在我的房門口。</p>
<p>“開門呵！房門上響了幾聲，我心床更衝動了。終於我硬起頭皮拉開了門</p>
<p>正面有個電筒照着我，那強烈的光芒，像幾千只金蝿在我面前示威。陡即，一個碗大的手拳抵在我胸口，這邊同樣也有人伸過手來，手里握着槍。</p>
<p>他們一夥五六個人，最初誰都不開口，祇向我房里詳細關切着。一會，六福在旁邊抖抖地拿過一張紙頭來——紙上的字跡，我不認識它，那是什麼意義呢？我也是不解，正這時候，他們中有人問起我話來。</p>
<p>我告了我的籍貫，姓名，年齡……</p>
<p>他們打着不大純熟的“支那”口音，還不厭求詳地追問下去，樣子像審着人犯。</p>
<p>“你不是關外人，為什麽到這兒來，”一個黑脸子的軍人對我問：</p>
<p>“……”我動了下嘴巴，才接下去道：“我是來找朋友的。”</p>
<p>“朋友？他很費勁地間：“他住在那里？”</p>
<p>“在××街上。”我鄭重地回答他。</p>
<p>“他是做什麼事情的呢？”</p>
<p>“也是經商的！”我仍鎮定着，不讓他們看出我在打抖。</p>
<p>“哦！”黑臉的傢伙最後也把槍收了回去。</p>
<p>他們自己人又咕嚕了一會，不知怎一來，硬要檢查我的行李。第一個是黑臉子的傢伙暴躁地用鐵棍打着旁邊這些箱箧，還睜大圓眼兒命令我：</p>
<p>“快些打開來，來……”</p>
<p>我蠕縮地震動着肩膀，邊又帶着求懇的態度向他們道：</p>
<p>“這兒大半是衣服，請馬虎一點行嗎？”</p>
<p>黑臉子的算過像個聾子，正經臉皮上連嘴巴也不動一下。六福却向我投了個眼色，這意思我懂得，他們是要錢，剛才樓下也正像有人五元十元的爭執着呵！</p>
<p>“要多少呢，”我低聲兒問六福道。</p>
<p>但不待六福回話，黑臉子的伸過一隻手來。——代表了五塊錢。</p>
<p>我故意裝出困難的樣子，把身邊所有四塊多錢湊成了那個數量交了過去，立刻一切都變得可以通融似的，五六個黑影擺搖了出去。</p>
<p>我回頭過來再望着窗外幽黯的夜色，摸摸空洞的袋底，這般就算就“查夜”嗎？</p>

<p>落霞孤鶩</p>
<p>落霞是從小被匪徒拐賣給趙重甫家的丫頭，受盡了女主人趙太太的虐待，但是她老是忍氣吞聲的勤奮工作。</p>
<p>這是一個冬天的早晨，陰森森的天氣，刮着很大的風，撒着鵝毛似的雪片。落霞穿着單薄的衣服，冒着大雪到菜市上去買菜。但是，不幸得很，她一個不留心，把買菜的錢丢了。她知道回去一定要挨一頓毒揍，於是站在雪地裏痛哭。幸虧江秋鶩經過，問明來由，慷慨解囊，給她一塊五毛錢，使落霞得免去了一頓揍。</p>
<p>落霞自從江秋鶩帮她忙之後，腦海裏常常有一位年輕的美男子在閃動。她每天經過江秋鶩帮忙的地方，就要站在那裏發一回楞。這一天，又是一個大雪的淸晨，她從菜市上買菜回來，適遇江秋鶩到求仁中學上課去。她因爲要請教他的姓名，就一直跟到求仁中學門口，在兩個小學生的嘴裏説出他的姓名叫江秋鶩，於是她就很滿意的回家；但時因爲躭誤了時候，又被她的女主人打得遍體鱗傷，甚至於不能工作。</p>
<p>過了三四天，落霞的傷尚未痊愈，可是趙太太逼着她起來工作。是日下午，趙重甫回來得很早，適遇那個表少爺朱柳風來訪，於是兩人就在客廳裏吃着炒栗子花生米談着閒話，落霞就在旁邊伺候着。在他們談話之間，她才知道江秋鶩是革命黨，那時候正是軍閥時代，軍警機關非常注意他，在兩三個鐘頭之內，江秋鶩就有性命的危險。落霞聽了這些話，就偷偷地跑到求仁中學，把江秋鶩引到鄰居馮姥姥家，告訴他軍警機關暗捕革命黨的消息，救他逃出了虎口。</p>
<p>江秋鶩自北京回南後，常常想到落霞救命之恩，於是就連寫了兩封信給他求仁中學裏的聽差萬有，叫他去打聽落霞的下落，并且給他十元錢做車費。萬有因爲情意難却，就拿了給落霞的信，到天香胡同找馮姥姥，托馮姥姥代轉；她因爲有利可圖，也就滿口答應了。但是這時候趙家已經搬到西城槐樹胡同去了，所以她不能够天天和落霞見面。某一天淸晨，天氣淸朗，馮姥姥就特意到西城去訪落霞，巧遇落霞於槐樹胡同內，於是就把江秋鶩的信交給她，完成了做紅娘的職務。</p>

<h3>花園錦簇之後天出演於卡爾登</h3>
<p>以擁有演員八十人美女四十人之百克門羣芳大會，久矣名聞全球，歷游世界各國，所至有聲，聲譽之隆，不亞於萬花團。當海京伯馬戲團來滬表演時，曾有百克門少數藝員參加，滬人士詫爲奇觀，可見技藝歌舞之不凡。今全團初次來申，已爲派克路卡爾登戲院重金聘得，定於本月二十五日（即後天）起，日夜開演。按該院對於歌舞劇團，選擇素主嚴格，數年前，萬花團來滬，即在該院表演，此百克門羣芳大會，足與萬花團分庭抗禮，别有一番新恣態，與滬人士相見云。</p>
<h3>「夜半歌聲」主題歌</h3>
<p>（一）空庭飛着流螢，高台走着狸　，人兒伴着孤燈，綁兒敲着三更。</p>
<p>（二）風凄凄，雨淋淋，花亂落，葉飄零，在這漫漫的黑夜裏，誰與我等着天明。</p>
<p>（三）我形兒是鬼似的猙獰，心兒是鐵似的堅貞，我祇要一息尚存，誓和那封建的惡魔王抗爭。</p>
<p>（四）啊姑娘，祗有你的眼，能看破我的平生；祗有您的心，能理解我的衷情。</p>
<p>（五）你是天上的月，我是那月邊的寒星；你是山上的樹，我是那樹上的枯藤；你是池中的水，我是那水上的浮萍。</p>
<p>（六）不，姑娘，我願意永做墳墓裏的人，理掉世上的浮名；我願意學那刑除的史臣，盡寫出人間的不平。</p>
<p>（七）哦，姑娘啊，天昏昏，地冥冥，用什麽來表我的憤怒？惟有那江潮的奔騰。用什麽來慰你的寂寞，惟有這夜半的歌聲！惟有這夜半的歌聲！</p>
<h3>關於「天作之合」</h3>
<p>「天作之合」是即將公映的聯華新作，一張國産的滑稽影片。</p>
<p>因爲生活的沉重，小市民觀衆大抵愛笑，愛輕鬆，所以卓别林的作品有着强大的叫座力，胡調的勞萊哈台也成了觀衆最親切的名字。中國的滑稽片本來不多，偶有一二張，大抵失之油滑，又很少意義。</p>
<p>「天作之合」的編導者爲沈浮，由韓蘭根，白璐，劉繼羣，殷秀岑主演。韓蘭根在這裏所演的是一個小工人，他質樸，老實，然而富於夢想，以和卓别林所扮演的角色一樣，白璐是貧家的少女，嬌憨，有良善的心，然而環境逼廹他做了賣淫婦。故事很動人，並且有含蓄，有風趣；笑料很多，却不是胡閙，使了解力較深的觀衆引起反感。這戲的結局，可以説是「悲劇的」，它雖然使人家笑，笑完了又使人覺得心裏沉重。</p>
<p>愛好聯華影片的觀衆，大概不會錯過欣賞的機會吧？</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Since the opening of the Third Plenary Session on the 15th, a total of six general assemblies, one preliminary meeting, four review sessions of various groups, and eight meetings of the presidium have been held. Important cases such as the regular convening of the National Assembly and the eradication of the Red Scourge have been passed. More than 170 members of the Central Committee participated. The intention of this plenary session has been fully stated in the declaration. The mission of the assembly was completed. The closing ceremony was held at 9:00 AM on the 22nd in the Central Auditorium. A joint Central Memorial Week was also held simultaneously. The Central Auditorium was slightly decorated in advance by the Secretariat.

<h3>Full Text of the Declaration of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The full text of the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee is as follows: On July 10th of last year, when the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was convened, the Central Committee members, in view of the increasing internal and external troubles, worked together to seek salvation. The solemn resolutions made were to safeguard territorial sovereignty externally and to promote peaceful unification internally. Since the adjournment of the meeting, tireless efforts have been made for seven months. This plenary session reviewed the achievements of the past, understood the current situation, and determined the future trends. After detailed discussions on various internal and external issues, solemn resolutions were made. Hereby, the main points are announced to our comrades and our countrymen. The Premier has clearly told us the origin of the national crisis in the Three Principles of the People, and has also clearly shown us the way to save ourselves and strengthen ourselves. Since the September 18th Incident, in extreme pain, we have only been able to follow the teachings of the Premier and seek a way out for the nation. The declaration of the Fifth National Congress clearly stated that "We are at a time of severe national crisis, and what we hold to deal with the crisis is only to uphold the Premier's two great instructions of 'Man will conquer nature' and 'Survival depends on ourselves, destruction depends on others,' to protect the survival of our country and the revival of our nation with the greatest patience and determination. We will not abandon peace until peace is completely hopeless, and when the country has reached a time when sacrifice is inevitable, we will resolutely sacrifice. We will hold on to the determination of the final sacrifice and make the greatest efforts for peace, hoping to turn the tide of the situation with sincerity and determination, so as to achieve the goal of self-reliance and co-existence, and work together with the countries of the world to achieve the realization of the Great Harmony." The declaration of the Second Plenary Session elaborated on this idea and added a more solemn explanation, stating that "Since the country is in this extraordinary situation, we must unite the people of the country with the greatest tolerance and painstaking efforts internally, and we must never recognize any fact of infringing on territorial sovereignty externally, nor will we sign any agreement infringing on territorial sovereignty. If there is a fact of infringement on territorial sovereignty, and political methods are exhausted without success, endangering the fundamental survival of the nation, we must make the determination of final sacrifice, without the slightest hesitation." After the adjournment of the Second Plenary Session, negotiations with Japan proceeded on this basis. In the intervening months, there were several instances of back-and-forth negotiations that were on the verge of breaking down, but the firm stance remained unchanged. When the bandit and puppet troops invaded Suiyuan, the power of the whole country was united to engage in defending the territory and resisting the invaders. Although the perpetrators of the Xi'an Incident wanted to use various slogans as tools to instigate people's hearts, the people of the country remained unshaken. In recent years, the understanding of the Party's ideology has deepened, and it is known that there is no other way to save the country and survive than this. The foreign policy of this plenary session should continue unchanged and strive to promote its progress. The consistent goal of our people is to seek self-reliance internally and co-existence externally. Even if we suffer damages beyond the limit of tolerance and resolutely engage in resistance, we only have the heart of self-defense and have no intention of rejecting foreigners. Therefore, the determination of sacrifice and the hope of peace are not contradictory at all. If the hope of peace has not been completely severed, we are still willing to firmly adhere to the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty to seek a preliminary solution, so that the bandits and puppets lose their dependence and sovereignty can be fully realized. In this way, although the unresolved issues between the two countries have not been completely resolved, the possibility of resolving disputes by peaceful means can begin to emerge. This is what our country must do with the concerted efforts of the whole country in the shortest possible time. As for other international relations, we should follow the path of international peace and strive to increase friendship. All political coordination and economic cooperation must be based on the principle of mutual benefit in order to seek closer mutual relations. This is the attitude that our country has adopted over the years, and it is the inherent spirit of our nationalism. We must adhere to it and further develop and promote it.</p>
<p>The foreign policy is as described above. As for the domestic policy, peaceful unification has been a common creed for the whole country for several years. It is necessary to unify in order to build a modern country. When the great task of saving the country and surviving is carried out, it is necessary to have peace so that everyone knows how to unite sincerely and go to the national crisis together in order to achieve true unification. However, there are things that should be paid attention to here. Peaceful unification and cessation of civil war have different meanings in terms of breadth. The purpose of peaceful unification is to concentrate the power of the entire country and the entire nation to eliminate the current national crisis, and to further step into the great road of democracy. If we understand the meaning of the entire country, we must know that the power of governance is indivisible, especially in the major areas of military affairs, diplomacy, finance, and transportation, which are related to the needs of national defense, and cannot be fully controlled by the central government. Otherwise, partial independence will become an inferior organism, and there will be no escape from international elimination. If we understand the meaning of the entire nation, we must know that all are nationals, sharing weal and woe. Even if there are slight differences in emotions between individuals or groups due to occupational relationships, the interests of the entire nation ultimately outweigh the interests of all individuals and all groups. Moreover, when external insults are constantly coming, the nationals will survive together or perish together. It is absolutely not possible to be confused by the theory of class struggle in order to dismantle their unity. These two meanings are the true meaning of peaceful unification. Therefore, the so-called cessation of civil war means that under the same ideology, differences of opinion are not determined by force, but by consultation. It does not mean that actions to split the country and split the nation can also be used as a pretext for cessation of civil war and proceed without fear. Since July of last year, the cause of unification has gradually taken shape, and the traces of local separatism will become a thing of the past. From now on, we should adhere to the principle of peaceful unification to adapt to national defense and to lay the foundation for long-term stability and security. As for the communist elements, although they have recently used the slogan of joint resistance against the enemy to call each other, according to past events, since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, they have claimed to join this party in order to engage in the National Revolution, but in reality, they have destroyed the National Revolution. Since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, they have used violent means to harm the Republic of China, reducing the country's external strength, and causing countless people's lives and property to be destroyed. All kinds of evils cannot be trusted with a single word. For the sake of the country and the people, this party will never bear to let the armed comrades and all comrades who have shed their blood and sweat for the past few years to engage in the work of suppressing bandits feel the pain of losing their success. No matter what method is used, we must use our own strength to eradicate the Red Scourge in China, so as to avoid endless future sorrows and permanently lay the foundation for national revival. This should be clearly stated to the world. As for organizing the people, training the people, and enabling them to jointly participate in the great cause of nation-building, it is the duty of this party. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, this party has deeply remembered its responsibilities and has stepped forward to do its part. At the same time, it deeply remembers the disaster of the overturned nest, and everyone has the same feeling. Therefore, it has spread the awareness of sincere unity and joint efforts to overcome the national crisis throughout the country. It has also discussed and decided on the convening of the National Assembly at various important meetings of this party. The Fifth National Congress solemnly resolved to convene the National Assembly within the 25th year of the Republic of China and announced the draft constitution. The First Plenary Session, based on this resolution, clearly set the date for November 12 of the same year and established command.</p>

<h3>No Changes in Heads of Departments and Ministries</h3>
<p>Wang Faqin stated that from the opening to the closing of the Third Plenary Session, the attending members of the Central Committee were harmonious and discussed major plans. The process was very good. As for the future political situation, it is rumored that there will be changes in the heads of the National Government and various departments and ministries. This is a rumor. Because the National Assembly is scheduled to be held on November 12, all issues will be decided at this meeting. There are only eight months left, so there will be no changes. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Statement by Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Opening up Speech Restricts only Three Points. Concentrating Talent Should be Fully Realized. Pardoning Political Prisoners Should be Limited.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the adjournment of the plenary session the other day, Chairman Chiang met with reporters in the rest room of the meeting hall. The reporters paid special attention to the two points of opening up speech and concentrating talent, and asked about the Central Government's future policy, and inquired about the central discussions and decision making process regarding the issue of pardoning political prisoners. The replies are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Opening up Speech: Many proposals mentioned this point, and it has also attracted the attention of the speech community in various places. The Central Government naturally attaches great importance to it. However, the Central Government has not restricted freedom of speech in the past. In addition to the provisions already stipulated in the Criminal Law and the Publishing Law, only the following three types cannot but be prohibited: 1. Speech and records that promote communism and endanger the country and disturb local public security; 2. Leaking military and diplomatic secrets; 3. Intentionally distorting right and wrong and fabricating rumors without any factual basis. Apart from these three, it is open and free, and it is also hoped that the whole country will respect legal freedom of speech. However, our country has a vast territory, and the opening up of speech in various places cannot be consistent. Often, the news that is permitted by the Central Government or released by the Central Government is not allowed to be released by local authorities. There are often complaints in the speech community. It must be known that the Central Government respects freedom of speech and does not want to have unexpected restrictions. In the future, we should follow this theme and improve the management of news and publications, and we should further support the development of the speech and publishing industry, so that the speech community can make full contributions under the premise of not betraying national interests. Now that the local authorities also have this kind of request, it is hoped that the local authorities will do so consistently in the future. For the news that the Central Government allows to be released, it must not be prohibited casually, so that all the news in the country can be communicated to every part of the country, so as to achieve the effect of unified will.</p>
<p>㊁ Concentrating Talent: Recently, various parties have paid much attention to this point, and it has also been discussed at the conference. In fact, the Central Government has been acting on this policy for several years. The Central Government not only wants to concentrate talent, but also wants to solicit talent from all sides to work together to save the country. However, we cannot follow the statements of the Communist Party and the so-called People's Front, so that politicians who repeatedly speculate and those who disturb the country, incite the provinces, and undermine unification can all take the name of concentrating talent as a stepping stone to hunt for official positions. The Central Government believes that the talents that the country urgently needs at present are experts who can truly contribute to all cultural and economic construction of the country, and are not limited to those who are good at writing and speaking, let alone those who rush around to engage in politics. It must be known that if this kind of concept is not corrected, China cannot advance to become a unified and progressive modern country. Therefore, the Central Government's policy in recent years is not only to concentrate talent, but also to nurture talent and encourage talent. For encouraging true talent, it is not about giving them official positions, but about enabling talents in various places to exert their special abilities and do various careers in various communities. The government has recently been subsidizing the careers of various provinces as much as possible to promote their development, which is to implement the Premier's will to make the best use of people's talents, and it is also to promote the construction of the country. The Chinese economic construction plan that was proposed at this plenary session has already been passed. The implementation of this plan does not know how many specialists and talents are needed. From a political point of view, the Central Government has recruited capable members from outside the party for ten years, and there is no discrimination against the various parties and factions before the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, let alone any intention to exclude them. Especially for domestic intellectuals and university professors with true knowledge and patriotic enthusiasm, we are humbly consulting and respecting them, hoping that they will contribute as much as possible in education and culture, and in various political and economic constructions, so as to nurture useful youth and complete the great cause of nation-building. Therefore, concentrating talent can be said to be a consistent policy of the Central Government, and it will be further realized in the future. All those who truly love the country and are willing to work for the country under the same goal will be respected, and we will welcome them.</p>
<p>㊂ The Issue of Pardoning Political Prisoners: The national crisis is at the current stage, and the work of nation-building is so urgent. The Central Government must be broad-minded and forgiving in order to bring about peace and stability. There have been many examples of leniency and exemption for those who have committed political mistakes in the past. However, the so-called political prisoners now are the Communist Party and reactionary elements who oppose the country and destroy society. For these criminals, there are certain regulations for self-renewal. Not a few of those who have been found to have signs of repentance and are allowed to be released on bail have already been released. Therefore, as long as these people truly realize their mistakes and no longer take advantage of this serious domestic opportunity to disrupt the country and undermine unification, and if they repent and renew themselves and have a guarantor, they can of course be given individual leniency. However, if we do not ask whether there is any sincerity in repentance and generally pardon everyone, then the Central Government, in order to attach importance to the laws and regulations of the country and ensure the peace and stability of society, will not casually issue this pardon. The government has the responsibility of the government, and leniency has its own method. We cannot be lenient without limits, and harm society by indulging. This should be understood by the people of the country.</p>
<p>In short, we must concentrate the will and strength of the whole country in the future, be sincere and frank, achieve unity and work hard with responsibility in order to save the current difficulties of the country. We deeply believe that patriotic people across the country will be able to support the resolutions of this plenary session and work together. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

Therefore, he will not report on the progress of the entire conference. He then gave a very detailed account of individual freedom and national freedom, which lasted for half an hour before the meeting adjourned. (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Lin spoke on individual freedom and national freedom at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 22nd. The original wording is as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, the Central Executive Committee held the Third Plenary Session a few days ago. The important resolutions of the entire conference have been mostly published in newspapers, and everyone can know about them. After the closing ceremony today, there will also be a declaration issued, outlining how to proceed and make efforts in various aspects of domestic and foreign affairs, which everyone can understand after reading the declaration. Therefore, I will not report on the progress of the entire conference today. I will speak on "Individual Freedom and National Freedom." In the third lecture of the Three Principles of the People, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Individuals should not be too free, and the nation should be completely free. When the nation can act freely, China will be a strong nation. To do this, the nation must sacrifice freedom." Dr. Sun Yat-sen meant that we should sacrifice individual freedom to fight for national freedom. The reason for this is very important now, so I am specifically raising this issue today to discuss it. What is freedom? Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Simply put, freedom is being able to move freely in a group." He also said, "After the fall of Rome in Europe, the autocracy of monarchs was very advanced until two or three hundred years ago, so the suffering of the people was also very serious and difficult to bear. At that time, the people of Europe, suffering from this lack of freedom, had to rise up and revolt to fight for individual freedom. The French Revolution was the result of this. After they gained individual freedom, they used laws to protect it. This is the origin of the freedom rights stipulated in the constitutions of various countries later. They were able to make good use of this kind of freedom right from the beginning, and they accomplished many things. Originally, the economic situation in Europe at that time was still very backward, and a large amount of manpower was needed for development. However, the people of Europe were able to use the power of freedom to do this kind of economic development, which led to the astonishing development of the economic situation later and indirectly promoted social progress. In this way, it can be seen that individual freedom has also made great contributions to human society in the past, which we cannot ignore. However, when individual freedom is exercised to the extreme, many弊害arise. The most obvious of these 弊害 is the disparity between the rich and poor classes. In order to avoid these 弊害, the current trend in the world is the opposite of the French Revolution. Everyone does not recognize that individuals have complete freedom. In politics, they impose various restrictions on individual freedom. In economics, there are ideas such as controlled economy to replace the doctrine of free competition. Recently, some people have even argued that the state is a higher-than-everything organic body, and that the individual is only an inseparable part of the state, with no independent purpose and should sacrifice for the state. From this point of view, it can be seen the trend of the world now. Furthermore, in our country, should we advocate individual freedom now? According to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, we individuals should not only be too free, but also sacrifice individual freedom. There are several points that can be distinguished in this: First, it is because we originally had a very full amount of freedom. An ancient Chinese saying goes, "Work at sunrise, rest at sunset, dig a well and drink, cultivate the field and eat. What does the emperor's power have to do with me?" These few sentences can prove that we have full individual freedom and do not need to seek further development. Second, the current trend in the world is not to talk about individual freedom. We have already said this earlier, so we cannot violate the trend of the world and talk about individual freedom again. Third, because we used to have too much freedom, most of it formed a sheet of loose sand without the power of unity, so when we encountered the oppression of external forces, we could not resist, resulting in the current situation. We have already deeply suffered from the harms of individual freedom and must find another way to remedy it. As for sacrificing individual freedom, there are also three points to say: First, our country is currently very unfree. If we want to ask for national freedom, we can only break individual freedom and form a very solid group to engage in struggle. Second, with social progress and increasing affairs, many of these affairs are not handled by individuals, so in fact, the scope of individual freedom of action cannot but be restricted. This is for the sake of protecting public welfare, and it cannot be otherwise. Third, when the country encounters extraordinary events, in order to be able to cope properly and achieve the goal of preserving national interests, the most important thing is that the people of the whole country can obey the leadership of the state and act in unison, so individual freedom must also be temporarily sacrificed. There are precedents for this in European and American countries. Otherwise, if we want to expand individual freedom at this time, it will disperse the strength of the country and increase the difficulties of the country. In short, in the past, because we had too much freedom, it formed a sheet of loose sand without organization, so we were invaded by other people. Now, if we want to resist this aggression, everyone must be able to sacrifice individual self-reliance, form a very solid group. Recently, the government has been carrying out baojia etc., which is also to organize everyone together, implement the goal of unity, and complete national freedom. In the future, after the entire country gains freedom, we can then promote individual freedom again, and that will be practical." (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Closing of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>-- Du</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which has attracted the attention of the whole country, was declared closed yesterday. This session of the conference, held after the Xi'an Incident, and during the brewing of a temporary truce, faced a situation where popular sentiment was wavering and strategies were uncertain, all of which required the conference to stabilize and decide upon. The responsibilities it bore were heavy, and the expectations pinned on it were profound. Therefore, before the start of the conference, all members of the Central Executive Committee were willing to overcome long distances and enthusiastically participate. In the conference hall, they were also able to avoid superficiality and concentrate on discussion. What they demonstrated to the people of the country was indeed the utmost effort towards unity. What we are anxiously waiting for is the determination of domestic and foreign policies, so that there is a direction to follow. Many important proposals in this conference, the resolutions of which have appeared in the newspapers, such as the report and handling of the Xi'an Incident, the resignation and retention of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the decision on the timing of the convocation of the National Assembly, and the authorization to amend the election law of representatives, are all conclusions that we urgently want to obtain. Now that we have obtained approval in principle, we cannot but look forward to future leaps forward. Public expectations are satisfied, and there is no room for criticism. Among them, there is one that is even more captivating in the eyes of the general public and has infinitely profound implications, namely the proposal on eradicating the "Red Menace" put forward by the presidium of the conference. This proposal is not only considered a very important issue by everyone in the country, but even foreign observers, if they have any concern, must also be anxious and attentive, holding their breath to watch the development of this situation.</p>
<p>Today, when external aggression is increasingly urgent, the slogan of concentrating China's strength has long been understood by the entire country. Unless one has ulterior motives, who would not hope for its realization? What is meant by concentrating China's strength is that all people of the Republic of China should tend towards unity and avoid the dissipation of will. All material resources of the Republic of China should be carefully conserved and not used for unnecessary sacrifices. Under the goal of resisting aggression, all grievances should be eliminated, and all opinions should be融化. Only in this way can we save the nation and seek survival. Without this, we can never rectify danger and stabilize the situation. It is a matter of natural justice and cannot be denied. Since the Communists are part of the people, they should understand this meaning deeply and jointly maintain the overall situation. Unfortunately, past events have often failed to achieve mutual understanding, causing the panic of the "Red Menace" and dispersing the strength against foreign forces. Now, reading the proposal of the presidium of the conference, which says, "The Communist Party, after being in a desperate situation, has advocated the saying of sincerity and acceptance of orders. We should embrace them with benevolence and never cut off the path of self-renewal," it seems that the Communist Party has realized that the past was not a good plan, and is secretly planning to show sincerity and accept orders. Although how they got there is still difficult to know the truth, this indication of theirs should be a definite fact. Furthermore, observing the methods of showing sincerity stipulated by the central government, such as abolishing all organizations that undermine unity and stopping class struggle and Red propaganda, are all able to make serious instructions based on practical necessities. If the Communist Party has a sincere intention to cooperate, there should be no place that cannot be followed, then the "Red Menace" can be eradicated invisibly, and the whole country can achieve complete unity. This is indeed the greatest harvest of this conference. However, without the Central Committee's virtuous intentions being far-reaching, how could this be achieved? The Central Committee, for several years, based on its purpose of striving for unity, has always taken tolerance and magnanimity to heart. In dealing with the Guangdong-Guangxi dispute in the past, and in handling the Xi'an Incident more recently, it has always sought to preserve the overall situation and deliberately make concessions, and was finally able to move people's hearts and mediate the crisis. To this day, even the Communists, who are said to be as incompatible as water and fire, have shown sincerity and come to seek cooperation. Therefore, from now on, there will be no more worries about domestic division and disintegration, and we can also permanently avoid the embarrassment of being stretched thin when facing the enemy together. We are not smart, but we can only offer our sincere prayers, hoping for the realization of the Communist Party's sincerity and for the success of national unity.</p>

First, the city of Oviedo, the capital of Asturias Province, was captured by the local militia formed by workers of the province. The city of Oviedo had been occupied by the Nationalist forces for several months, and the government forces had been attacking it for a long time without success. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the government forces began their offensive again, first using artillery to shell the Nationalist positions. The militia composed of miners from Asturias Province then launched a charge, and other teams cut off the Nationalist communication lines and occupied various military strongholds outside the city. The Nationalist forces inside the city, under the command of General Aranda, resisted fiercely, but the miners continued to advance and broke into the city. At this point, all areas inside the city were in the hands of the government forces, but street fighting continued. Second, yesterday, government forces advanced towards the town of Morata de Tajuña in the Jarama River area southeast of Madrid and captured several new positions, which allowed them to control the Nationalist communication lines between the cities of Maranoza and Madrid and Talavera. Third, government forces in Avila Province, northwest of Madrid, occupied the town of Valdemaqueda, which threatened the city of Cebreros and the communication lines between the former Nationalist Qian and the city of Avila. After that, the Nationalist forces' plan to advance on the city of El Escorial would have to be abandoned. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Almería: After the government forces and the Nationalist forces engaged in a fierce battle in Guétjar, the government forces suffered heavy losses.

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Jarama River Area for Days</h3>
<p>Heavy Losses for Rebel Army</p>
<p>Madrid: A special report from our correspondent. The fighting in the Jarama River area south of Madrid was extremely fierce this morning. Although the government forces' artillery fire was extremely fierce, the Nationalist forces, especially those with automatic weapons, were still able to concentrate in one place to plan an attack. As of today, the fierce battle in the Jarama River area has lasted for eleven days. The Nationalist forces have suffered extremely heavy losses, and several elite units have been wiped out. General Miaja, chairman of the Defense Committee, told our correspondent that the fighting in the Madrid area will be prolonged, but the rebel army lacks soldiers, while the military strength inside Madrid is very sufficient and will never surrender under any circumstances. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Avila: A special report from our correspondent. Several government artillery teams in the southern suburbs of Madrid bombarded the rear of the Nationalist positions, but were destroyed by Nationalist artillery fire. The cannons used by the government forces were made in the Soviet Union, and each cannon could fire four shells at a time. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Avila: Our correspondent learned from the Nationalist authorities that there had been no changes in the war on the Madrid front in the past week. At this time, the Nationalist front line starts from the town of Villaverde in the southern suburbs, goes east along the lower reaches of the Manzanares River to the town of Vaciamadrid, crosses the confluence of the Manzanares and Jarama Rivers, and then goes along the Valencia Avenue, with a distance of 600 meters in most places and only 4 meters in a few, to the south of Arganda del Rey, then passes through the town of Morata de Tajuña to the town of Nuevo Baztán, and then follows the right bank of the Jarama River to the towns of Anchuelo and Sena. The Nationalist forces are now consolidating their positions along this front line. After the Valencia Avenue was occupied by the Nationalist forces, it has not been retaken by the government forces. Madrid is now isolated and helpless, and its fall is inevitable. In addition, two aircraft belonging to the government forces flew over the city yesterday afternoon and dropped bombs. Nine soldiers and civilians in the city were killed and the number of injured is unknown. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Rebels Complete Preparations for General Offensive on Madrid</h3>
<p>Reinforcements Added, Weapons Sharp</p>

The government forces tried to destroy the rebels' newly added cannons yesterday, but the outcome is unknown here. Fibbs News Agency reported that 1,000 people were killed or injured in the battle of Oviedo yesterday. The city is still being contested by both sides. (21st National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Militiamen Captured After Fall of Málaga</h3>

American expatriates have now telegraphed the Washington government, saying that Málaga is gradually returning to normal and that the local American consulate should reopen its doors. After the fall of Málaga, the Nationalist forces temporarily appointed the Duke of Seville as the governor-general of the area. (Central News Agency 22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Various Countries Ban Volunteers from Going to Spain to Fight</h3>
<p>Seemingly Favorable to Rebel Army, Russia and Germany Have Already Implemented</p>
<p>Salamanca: Today, people here feel that the virtual ban by Europe on foreign volunteers entering Spain will be favorable to General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces. It is believed that the government forces and the International Brigades must now fight against the insurmountable advantage of the Nationalist forces. Since volunteers cannot continue to flow to Madrid, the Spanish Civil War, which has lasted for seven months, seems likely to end soon. (Central News Agency 22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government passed a resolution today banning people from going to Spain to join the war. The order banning volunteers from entering Spain also came into effect at midnight yesterday. Twenty-seven countries have now joined the resolution of the Non-Intervention Committee in the Spanish Civil War and are abiding by it. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, the German government promulgated an order prohibiting people from joining the war in Spain and forbidding people from traveling in Spain and Spanish Morocco.

<h3>Non-Intervention Committee to Convene Again for Discussions</h3>
<p>[London] It is expected that the governments of the twenty-seven countries participating in the London Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War will implement the ban in the next few days, fulfilling the agreement that took effect on Saturday night. As a result, no troops can be recruited in those countries to participate in the Spanish Civil War, and volunteers cannot set out or pass through those countries to go to Spain. As for the measures for maritime and land monitoring to prevent violations of the agreement, no agreement has yet been reached, but the existing difficulties are currently being adjusted. According to the agreement banning foreign troops from going to Spain to participate in the war, which took effect on Saturday night, it was stipulated that the monitoring system should be implemented from midnight on March 6.

<h3>Lion and Bull Fight</h3>
<p>Advertising Allure, Bullfighting Arena Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>Mexico City: The "Progress Bullfighting Arena" in Guadalajara Province advertised today's spectacle as a fight between a fierce lion and a brave bull, using moving words in advance to make it a big draw. The crowds were indeed moved by it, and the number of people who bought tickets to enter the arena was extremely crowded. When they reached the arena, the so-called brave bull was actually a calf. Before it had time to resist, the lion opened its gluttonous mouth and swallowed it whole. The audience realized that they had been deceived, and the crowd was furious. Bricks and stones flew in the arena, and some opened fire with pistols. Finally, the crowd set fire and reduced the bullfighting arena to ashes. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Minister of the Army Reiterates the Necessity of Increasing Troops in the Diet</h3>
<p>Also Defends That There Is No Intention of Aggression Against China; The Government Avoids Conflict with Political Parties; The Budget Bill is Expected to Pass the Diet</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, the Minister of the Army explained the recent domestic and international situation, the strengthening of armaments in the Far East, and the state of armaments in Europe at the House of Peers and Representatives. He then stated that although the Soviet Union claims to be reducing armaments, it has not actually done so. Moreover, the Japanese army, and especially Japanese armaments, cannot compare with the fifteen divisions of the Soviet Far East Army in terms of defense. The Minister of the Army also said that Japan can only strengthen its military force, and first must strengthen its air force, second, increase armaments in Manchuria, third, increase troops in Manchuria, and fourth, prepare operational materials. (Daimeng Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] During today's afternoon session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Mr. Makino of the Seiyukai party requested an explanation of the mainland policy. Army Minister Sugiyama Gen categorically stated that the military does not place special emphasis on mainland policy, and what it considers urgent is: ① to engage in the sound development of "Manchukuo"; ② in view of the inseparable relationship between China and Japan, to promote economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Sugiyama also solemnly declared that the army does not even have a plan for aggression against China. (Central News Agency Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives is scheduled to stop questioning at the Budget Committee on the 25th, convene subcommittees, and then hold a general meeting on March 3rd to decide on various matters. Up to today, members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have discussed the increase in the allocation of funds for adjusting local finances, the revised budget, and the contradictions in Finance Minister Yuki's finances at the Budget Committee, and have touched on their core points. Although they are dissatisfied with the government's perfunctory responses, they have not exerted any power, so no concrete results have been achieved. The Budget Committee is simply proceeding peacefully on its scheduled course. Only the increase in the allocation of funds for local finances and the issue of the return of the budget form to the government have the potential to stir up a low pressure. Not only the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, but also the Proletarian party and small factions are pursuing these two issues from the same standpoint. Some have strong opinions, insisting on a resolute attitude regardless of the current government's attitude, so the depth of this issue is gradually increasing as they continue to debate it two or three times, and it is possible that small waves will inevitably occur. However, the government has stated in the Diet that it intends to submit the permanent solution to the local allocation issue to the next Diet for discussion, recognizing that the gradually determined budget of 70 million yen for the twelfth year is no less than the plan of the previous cabinet, so it is trying to avoid immediately increasing the amount, requesting understanding on the condition of establishing a permanent solution. As for the issue of the budget form, although Prime Minister Hayashi stated at the Budget Committee on the 20th that he would study this issue, it is difficult to clarify the reduction of 23 million yen each for the army and navy budgets from various perspectives, so he is determined to proceed with the initially decided policy when submitting the amendment. Therefore, the more political parties pursue this issue, the more the confrontation between the government and the Diet intensifies. However, based on past situations, it is doubtful whether political parties can dare to advance towards the government. According to general observations, it is almost certain that the political parties and the government will implement a political compromise and the budget bill will be approved.

<h3>Seeking Peaceful Resolution of the Keelung Incident</h3>
<p>The Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Answers Questions from Diet Members</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At today's meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives, when a certain member of the Seiyukai party discussed guaranteeing individual rights, he again mentioned the incident on October 7th of last year in Keelung, Taiwan, where three British sailors and one officer were beaten and insulted by Japanese police. The Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs replied that the authorities have already investigated this matter in detail, but there is no evidence to support the British account of the situation at the time. He also said that this matter is still under negotiation, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now working to resolve this incident peacefully. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Devote Efforts to Adjusting Relations with Britain</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Because of Britain's attitude towards Japan after the establishment of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact, the Japanese government believes that this has an important bearing on Japan's future diplomatic policy, and is paying close attention to its superficial and underlying actions. According to recent information from various sources, the current situation in British diplomatic circles has changed since the establishment of the Japan-Germany Pact. The opinion of the British Foreign Office tends to advocate re-examining the previously insufficient understanding of Japan policy. Britain is compiling a huge national defense budget, and from the perspective of practical considerations, is reflecting on its excessive attitude towards Japan. In this extraordinary period in Europe, it intends to reform the previous Eden diplomacy, that is, Britain is compiling a large national defense budget of 1.5 billion pounds for a five-year plan to confront Germany, in order to prevent any regrets. At this time, Japan's cooperation with Germany will inevitably promote the strengthening of Germany, and internal discussions have occurred within the British government advocating changing its diplomatic policy. From this perspective, it is almost certain that Britain will adopt a policy of preventing Japan from entering the German camp. Therefore, regarding the discussion of Britain's national defense strengthening and abandoning Anglo-Japanese friendship, it used extreme nervousness to deny this claim through Reuters communications. As for the China issue, although Britain has not been without a cooperative attitude with Japan in the past, the Japanese government has decided to consistently adopt a calm attitude and pay close attention to Britain's actions towards Japan. In short, there will inevitably be frequent exchanges between Japan and Britain around the time when Prince Chichibu, the Emperor's younger brother, visits Britain this spring. The Japanese government has already sent instructions to Ambassador Yoshida in Britain to collect information from all sides, and at the same time has decided on a policy to adjust relations between the two countries.

<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Japanese Proletarian Party</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Labor-Farmer Proletarian Council, led by House of Representatives member Kato Kanju, held its first national convention at the Shiba Ward Coordination Hall yesterday. 350 representatives from across the country attended. The meeting proceeded under strict vigilance from the police authorities. As a result, it was decided to rename the Communist Party the "Japanese Proletarian Party." However, the movement guidelines for a unified anti-fascist movement and the convention declaration, etc., that they resolved were all deleted by the authorities. (Daimeng News Agency Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Refuses to Participate in Raw Materials Conference</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The League of Nations Administrative Council previously decided to establish a committee on the issue of raw material allocation, with representatives from fourteen countries as members, responsible for studying the issue of re-distributing world raw materials. The committee is scheduled to meet in Geneva on March 8th. Now, the German government has notified the League of Nations Secretariat that Germany has decided not to participate in the committee. People here explain that the reason for Germany's adoption of this decision is that the issue of raw material allocation is related to many issues in politics and economics, so it cannot be studied separately. However, some speculate that the raw material allocation committee is affiliated with the League of Nations, and since Germany is not a member of the League of Nations, it has made this decision. This aspect is not concealed by the general public in Germany. (Havas Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Signing of the German-Polish Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The German-Polish trade agreement was officially signed in Warsaw today.

The validity period of the agreement is set at two years. (Havas Telegraph, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Neurath Arrives in Vienna; German-Austrian Talks Begin</h3>
<p>Exchanging Frank Opinions on Various Political and Economic Issues</p>
<p>[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath and his party arrived here this morning and were warmly welcomed. Neurath's first action after arriving here was to lay a wreath at the Austrian War Memorial. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] At noon, German Foreign Minister Neurath, accompanied by German Minister to Austria Papen, visited Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt and State Chancellor Schuschnigg one after another. Afterwards, the Austrian Chancellor hosted a banquet for them, and Foreign Minister Schmidt accompanied them. During the banquet, various planning issues related to the political and economic affairs of the two countries were discussed in a friendly spirit. (Havas Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] Today, when German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived in Vienna, Austria, members of the Austrian National Socialist Party held a grand gathering to express their welcome. Wherever the German Foreign Minister and his delegation passed by car, members of the National Socialist Party gathered and shouted "Long Live Hitler!" Although 3,000 Austrian police officers were temporarily dispatched, they could only maintain traffic and were almost unable to cope with the actions of the masses. Many people were arrested. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The attitude of official circles here towards German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria can be glimpsed in the commentary of the semi-official newspaper "Foreign Traffic News." The newspaper said that all German people support this visit, just as they warmly welcomed Austrian Foreign Minister Dr. Schmidt's visit to Germany in November last year. It also stated, "The significance of this visit is not only an ordinary exchange between friendly countries, but is actually a visit by an important German figure to the capital of another Germanic country." Its important significance lies not in seeking to adjust the foundation of the relationship between the two Germanic countries of Germany and Austria, because after the signing of the treaty on July 11, 1936, this foundation already exists. The current hope is to make this foundation more secure and to bring practical benefits to both countries politically and economically. Neurath's visit proves that Germany does not want to give up any opportunity to enhance the spirit of sincere unity between the two countries. This visit will also help to implement the agreement signed on July 11, 1936. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<h3>Close Associate of the Polish Army Inspector General Issues Right-Wing Declaration</h3>
<p>Denouncing Communism as Incompatible with the Polish Spirit; National Defense Relies on Organized Economic Life</p>
<p>Warsaw - Colonel Koc, a close associate of French Army Inspector General Rydz-Śmigły, issued a broadcast declaration today, clarifying that the concept of the state should be based on ensuring the existence of the state. Therefore, the people should end internal strife, and national defense should be guided by one person according to the internal needs of the country. Koc also said that communism is completely incompatible with the Polish spirit, and national defense actually relies on the organization of economic life. Minorities account for 30% of the total population. If their actions do not violate the interests of the state, they will be respected. Koc finally asked the Polish people to wholeheartedly and single-mindedly assist the state, so that the disciplined strength led by one person can be successful. Koc stated that his remarks today are based on the declaration made by Inspector General Rydz-Śmigły in May last year. According to Rydz-Śmigły, he is the successor designated by the late dictator General Piłsudski. Judging from Koc's declaration today, Poland is about to become a disguised autocratic state. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Colonel Koc, the leader of the Polish veterans, recently called on patriotic people from the national army to organize the national front. He delivered a radio speech, announcing the main points of the front's political program, roughly stating: The national front should be placed under the protection of the army, and national defense should be the primary task. Communism in Poland has been completely eradicated in 1919-20, and there is no room for it now. As far as the economy is concerned, the national front should protect private property and individual creativity under state supervision, so that "Poland will never have class struggle." In addition, the national front will also improve the situation of farmers and develop urban industry to accommodate the surplus rural population. (Havas Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>Italian Government Orders the Conscription of One Million Men</h3>
<p>Testing the Effectiveness of National Mobilization; The First Response to Britain's Military Expansion; Italy Increases Military Preparations Pending Decision by the Supreme Party Meeting</p>
<p>[Rome] The first response from Italy to Britain's expansion of armaments is to order the conscription of five classes of men in the country, totaling about one million people. All men born between 1900 and 1904 are subject to conscription. Once the date and location are announced, they must report on time. The purpose of this conscription is to test the effectiveness and speed of Italy's mobilization plan. After these conscripted men report, they can still be sent home if there is no reason to keep them in the camp. Furthermore, the Fascist Supreme Council will meet on March 1 to discuss the military situation. It is said that the meeting will make more important decisions regarding the general strengthening of the Italian military, especially the strengthening of the air force.

<h3>2,000 Indigenous People Arrested in Albania</h3>
<p>Italian Governor-General Slightly Injured in Assassination Attempt; Albanian General Ambushed and Killed</p>
<p>[Rome] According to an official announcement from Rome, Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, General Graziani, has been recovering well since he was attacked in Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, the other day. In this assassination attempt, Graziani was only slightly injured, but his subordinate, General Liotta, was seriously injured and has now had a foot amputated. Since this case occurred, 2,000 people have been arrested by the police in Addis Ababa, and will be interrogated one by one by the military law officer in order to find the culprit. Currently, the suspected areas of Addis Ababa have been cleared by the Fascist inspection team. Addis Ababa is guarded by 30,000 Italian troops. Most of the people in Addis Ababa are still calm. When this assassination occurred, General Graziani and his subordinates were distributing goods to the poor in churches and monasteries. Some Albanians who were dissatisfied with Italian rule mixed in with the crowd and threw bombs at Graziani and others, injuring Graziani and General Liotta, as well as many Albanians standing nearby. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>[Rome] Former Southern Route Commander of Abyssinia, General Marian, fought hard against Italian Governor-General Graziani. The Italian authorities offered a heavy reward for his head. Now, he was ambushed and killed while fighting with an Italian column on the border of the Great Lakes. In addition, an Albanian general and many dignitaries were captured and executed by shooting. Now that Marian is dead, the only major Albanian general who has not been captured is General Taysta, the son-in-law of the Albanian King. (Central News Agency/Reuters Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Naval Exercises in the Western Mediterranean</h3>

<p>[London] According to the Daily Telegraph, "The British Home Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet must hold joint exercises every year.

<h3>Posthumous Honors for Ordzhonikidze</h3>
<p>Solemn Funeral Ceremony</p>
<p>[Moscow] After the death of People's Commissar of Heavy Industry Ordzhonikidze, a funeral was held in Red Square. Stalin, various important figures of the Soviet government, ambassadors and ministers from various countries, and tens of thousands of people attended the funeral. The ceremony was very grand. After the cremation of the body, the urn containing the ashes was built into the walls of the Kremlin Palace, and placed with the ashes of the former Secretary of the Communist Party, Kirov (who was assassinated in December 1934). Pravda recently published a eulogy for Ordzhonikidze, and explained the cause of death, stating that during the Tsarist era, Ordzhonikidze engaged in secret revolutionary work while in exile in Siberia and abroad. After the revolution succeeded, his vigorous work led to illness, which was the distant cause of death. Down to the present, it was the hateful Trotskyist elements that took Ordzhonikidze's life.</p>
<p>[Moscow] Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov and People's Commissar of the Army Voroshilov both attended and delivered eulogies. In his speech, Molotov said, "Under the leadership of Ordzhonikidze, Soviet heavy industry has now been transformed into a powerful force in the world, and the national economic and technological construction of the Soviet Union has been laid on its foundation." Voroshilov said, "If the Red Army can become the world's most powerful army, it is due to the technical equipment and weapons configuration that can adapt to various modern needs. For this reason, later historians will often give credit to Ordzhonikidze." (Havas Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<h3>Large Number of Traitors Arrested in Chaoshan</h3>
<p>A Certain Foreign Firm Openly Gambles During New Year; Many Traitors and Smugglers Flock There</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Chaoshan is a coastal area with many foreign firms established in recent years. Traitors and smugglers are rampant, colluding with hooligans, trafficking drugs, gambling, and engaging in all sorts of criminal activities. The foreign firms, relying on their special backgrounds, not only engage in smuggling but also undertake special tasks. Now, the Chaoshan Industrial and Commercial Anti-Smuggling Association has been successively established, and the people are voluntarily severing ties with traitors and smugglers, establishing anti-smuggling regulations, mutually guaranteeing surveillance, and encouraging each other to prevent the transportation of smuggled goods. The foreign firm traitors and smugglers are therefore fundamentally struck by this. Recently, they have been devoting all their efforts to drug trafficking and gambling, colluding with traitorous elements, and establishing various secret organizations to achieve their goals. During the Lunar New Year, the military police in Shantou and various Chaoshan-Meizhou villages strictly enforced the prohibition of smoking and gambling. In recent days, many ignorant gamblers have been arrested in various counties, districts, and villages. The military police put paper hats on their heads and paraded them through the streets as a warning to the public. Hearing this, the people became cautious and dared not test the law. However, in Shantou city, the hotel of a certain country's firm, relying on its gunboat as a protective symbol, openly and blatantly attracted traitors and hooligans who had connections with it to come in to smoke and gamble. As a result, the hotel was crowded with carriages and horses. Inside, there were fan-tan, pai gow, dice, mahjong, poker, and all kinds of gambling tools, all readily available. A national of a certain country guarded the entrance, shouting and making noise all night long. Especially after New Year's Eve, it was most lively for several consecutive days. Inside, there were also female attendants, wine, dishes, and opium lamps. Xue Hanguang, the director of the Shantou Public Security Bureau, believes that these shameless people are relying on foreign powers to harm the country, which is truly the most shameless act. It is completely different in nature from ignorant women and children stealing free time to gamble. Therefore, he specially dispatched dozens of plainclothes detectives to lie in wait near the gambling foreign firms. Whenever any Chinese people went inside to gamble and smoke, they would be arrested and taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation after they finished gambling and left. In several consecutive nights, more than 160 people were arrested and sent to the correctional facility for detention and interrogation. When they were escorted, the situation was very serious. Each person's hands and feet were shackled with three sets of iron fetters, treated as national traitors. The citizens who saw this all applauded. The extent to which these traitors had connections with people from a certain country varied. Some acted as agents for smuggled goods, while others indirectly undertook special tasks. If these internal traitors are not wiped out in one fell swoop, the foundation of spiritual national defense cannot be established. The Chaoshan garrison will arrest all those who come forward and interrogate them together for cross-examination.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Collapse of the Dike at the Japanese Willow Sluice Gate</p>
<p>The Willow River is an important trunk river in this county, discharging excess water from Taihu Lake and attracting the Jiang tide. It is related to the water conservancy of seven counties in Jiangnan, including Suzhou, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, Wuxi, and Cheng. As it is dredged and silted up from time to time, the nearby fields are affected. Last March, with the approval of the Yangzi River Water Conservancy Committee, the National Economic Committee allocated 300,000 yuan to build a giant sluice gate to facilitate opening and closing. In addition, a section of the Willow Dike was filled in and a new dike of about half a mile was opened. Unexpectedly, the dike embankment was not firmly constructed, and the Jiang tide was turbulent, causing the two banks to shake and collapse. Now there is a danger of breaches, and farmers have already suffered considerable losses. The district chief has urgently telegraphed the county government to forward the report to the higher authorities, requesting that measures be taken to repair it.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Second Day of the Cultural Relics Exhibition</p>
<p>After the opening of the Canglang Pavilion Cultural Relics Exhibition, visitors included Gu Shusen, director of the Ministry of Education; Teng Ruoqu, counselor of the Executive Yuan; Wang Diancun, professor of the Central Political School; Xiang Shaoxuan, chief of the Education Application Section; Yi Junzuo, editor-in-chief; Deng Zhexian, principal of the Industrial School; Shao Heting, principal of Suzhou Middle School; Zhang Hanwei, chief of the Police Bureau; and more than two thousand people. This cultural relics exhibition not only demonstrates the superiority of Wu's culture and art in the Southeast but also highlights the noble spirit of Zhou Zhongjie and the extraordinary filial piety of his son, Zi Pei, which is worthy of emulation by visitors. The "Blood Memorial" by Zhou Zipei (Maolan) on display at the exhibition was written by Mr. Zhou out of grief over the death of Zhongjie in prison. In the early years of Chongzhen, he wrote a memorial in blood to redress his father's grievances. Because there were taboo words in the memorial, he changed the manuscript before submitting it. However, the blood from his finger had dried up, so he used blood from his tongue instead. He finally cleared his father's name. The original manuscript is still treasured today, and the bloodstains are still fresh, showing his boundless filial piety. Visitors were all moved by it. There is a postscript by Shi Gong at the end of the memorial, which is also related to historical materials of the time. It is a collection of the Xu family. All members of the Suzhou-Shanghai Literature and Art Society, including Zheng Yimei, Jiang Hongjiao, Xu Bibo, Zhao Mianyun, Tao Lingyue, Fan Yanqiao, Fan Peiyu, Zhou Shoujuan, Gu Mingdao, Cheng Xiaoqing, Zhou Kerang, Fan Jugao, Fan Junbo, Cheng Zhanlu, Sun Licheng, Liu Junran, Xu Yunqiu, Fang Shenchang, and dozens of Suzhou calligraphers such as Wu Daichiu, Fan Shaoyun, Chen Jiamin, Gu Moqi, and Zhao Ziyun, visited the cultural relics exhibition and had a grand gathering for a meal and photo session at Canglang Pavilion. In the afternoon at three o'clock, they went to the Net Master's Garden to attend the Jiangsu Modern Literary and Art Writers Promotion Association. More than ten people from the Third College of Literature of Daxia University are scheduled to come to Suzhou on the 26th to visit the provincial social education institutions. All members are scheduled to come to Suzhou on the 22nd to visit the cultural relics exhibition and gather at the Suzhou Museum.

<h3>The True Meaning of National Salvation Through Unification</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>After national salvation through unification becomes a practical national front, the development of this front will go through many struggles. I think Mr. Luo must know this better than I do. In recent years, the unification movement led by Chiang Kai-shek has achieved today's results, and how much rhetoric, running around, and struggle has been spent? Even the Xi'an Incident, how much compromise was spent on this peaceful resolution! This material is still very fresh! Isn't this a struggle? This is just the beginning of unification—there are already struggles in strategy and tactics here. Unfortunately, in the past, we did not establish a common front first, so the struggle often went off track, leading to the unfortunate Xi'an Incident, which almost caused a big mistake. With the major premise of unification established, although the struggle will still be, as I said, an "undeniable fact," it will not go beyond a certain track. Its development will follow the development of the national war of resistance. Why do I regard the "united front as a process of struggle?" I am only observing the results based on the actual actions of various social forces in practice, not a static state. Movement is dynamic, it is developing! Every social force must express its characteristics in the movement. In unified action, a strategy and a tactic must be determined through various discussions, and a correct strategy is often obtained after countless arguments. Truth is often born in struggle, so I say, "The united front can be said to depend entirely on this struggle for its survival and development." "To unite but fear internal struggle and avoid due struggle cannot be beneficial to the united front but is a disloyalty to the common sacred war." I am confident that I have made this clear. The internal struggle I am talking about is by no means a reckless proposition to use the means adopted in the Xi'an Incident to destroy one's own camp in the united war of resistance. I never thought that this meaning would be misunderstood by Mr. Luo.</p>
<p>I don't know if the above explanation has dispelled Mr. Luo's misunderstanding, but I am grateful to Mr. Luo for this opportunity to explain these words again. I ask myself that I and Mr. Luo are both friends on the same path of saving the country, and we have never met before, so there is no personal grievance at all. Mr. Luo's misunderstanding of me mainly comes from confusing the People's Front with the National Front. I think that after this explanation, there is generally no reason why we cannot understand each other!</p>
<p>However, I still cannot restrain myself from speaking. Today, there are still many people in Chinese society who are patriotic but have a very vague understanding. Many people cannot have a concrete outline of the true meaning of national salvation through unification. In the past, many unfortunate facts and incorrect concepts often played with and influenced people, hindering the connection between people and becoming an obstacle to spiritual unification. One of these obstacles is the narrowness fostered by erroneous concepts, which limits people with a heart to serve the country from walking on the path of saving the country. This is what I often find most painful. Today, there are still people with deep prejudices who wear colored glasses to look at people and love to add colors to others for no reason, transforming them into a decomposition of national power. Even if the world's original intention is for the country, the result will invisibly create chaos and indirectly help the enemy. Writing this, I can't help but shed tears. Today, all people with national consciousness should truly reflect on themselves and correct this bias!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to shout long live the unification of the entire nation to save the country, and form a closely-knit national front! Oppose the People's Front that does not conform to China's national conditions! And the traitorous front that sells out China! And pay national salute to Mr. Luo! (End)</p>

<h3>Important West League Matches This Weekend: French Business vs. Loyola</h3>

Team members Feng Nianhua, Zhou Dayun, Han Zhenyuan, Yin Guiren, Kuang Yaoya, Chen Xiangneng, Yu Zude, Wang Huizhen, Cai Yanxiong, Chen Zongqi, Weng Renan, and others must all attend on time to form a team for practice. It is also heard that before the start of the championship, the Chinese team will have five practice games.</p>
<h3>Haiqing Loses to Russian Army Due to Underestimation</h3>
<p>West League Group A Championship Shaken</p>
<p>The Haiqing team, the reigning West League Group A volleyball champion, lost two games last night to the strong Russian team, their rival from the previous season, by scores of 15 to 10 and 15 to 8. From then on, Haiqing, who had the highest hopes for this championship, has been shaken, and the one who will reap the benefits is the West League Russian team, who has lost to the West League once. Su Ke is not worth mentioning. Haiqing has not been successful since the start of this season and was almost defeated by Su Ke last time. However, this battle is a double round robin, so if they can double their efforts, the situation may still be salvageable. In short, whether Haiqing can retain the champion seat will depend on the success or failure of next week's battle against the West League, which will determine their final fate.</p>

<h3>World Women's Swimming Record: Denmark Threatens the Netherlands</h3>
<p>(National Maritime News Agency, Amsterdam, 20th) Danish female swimmer Helvig has repeatedly set new records, causing panic in the local water sports scene, worrying that the Danish team will seriously threaten Dutch female players. Although the Netherlands maintains 11 or 12 of the 26 world women's swimming records, its strong enemy, Denmark, only has four. However, it is believed here that this ratio may change at any time. It is pointed out here that Helvig has broken the Dutch swimmer Odun's 400-meter prone record and holds the world records for 500-meter, 800-meter, and 1,000-meter prone. Moreover, the Danish team is not limited to Helvig alone, which makes the local sports scene even more uneasy. The local area has fully understood the efforts of Danish women's swimming pioneer Peterson in training young female athletes, because the results of Dutch swimming over the years are also the result of the efforts of Mrs. Braun, the "Mother of Dutch Women's Swimming."</p>

<h3>A Message to the Chinese Nursing Community (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>㊂ Ensuring Career Continuity: If we want the nursing profession to exist forever, we must have concrete measures to ensure the profession, because the salary earned by nurses each month is so meager that it can only provide for monthly living expenses, maintaining the status quo of living for a month. In fact, there is no possibility of savings. Once they exceed the age of forty, their physical evolution causes them to enter old age, and their duties and work efficiency fluctuate accordingly. There is a risk of unemployment. Once unemployed, they have no special skills to engage in other professions. They cannot succeed in business and cannot find employment. Inevitably, there is a risk of starvation. Therefore, if there are no measures to guarantee the future of the profession, people will not be eager to study nursing. The nursing profession can never develop, and the nursing profession will eventually collapse and perish. The survival of the nursing profession is only a matter of time. Therefore, it is hoped that the leaders of the Nursing Association will not ignore the implementation of career security as insignificant and that the establishment of preventive medicine is of the same nature. In the future, please carefully study and pay attention to it.</p>
<p>㊂ Words for Future Partners.</p>
<p>The wheel of the times is constantly unfolding the "survival of the fittest" scenario. The light of youth passes easily, burying the rapid pace that turns the hair of young people into snow-white pigments. When we are nursing students, we must first recognize ourselves as reserve forces preparing to serve society and transporters storing food. How to work hard to learn skills, build character, and tightly grasp time and the times, not allowing it to flow away like water, disappear, and waste the past. Do not be influenced by the subconscious of society, seeking vanity and admiring extravagance. We should establish our own good character, knowledge, and healthy body and mind. We need to be good students and good citizens, which is our only life philosophy.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's nursing education is innovating day by day, and the nursing profession is also difficult to manage with the times. If you pass through your studies carelessly and have no strengths, you will not be able to stand firm in the present era and society and will eventually be eliminated. Future partners! Get up! How will you inspire and cheer yourself up, bury your head and work hard in the short three years to prepare for the needs of serving society in the future? Only by quoting a sentence from the Four Books: "Zeng Zi said: ... I examine myself three times a day ..." can we use it as a constant reminder. Even when serving society, we should grasp two kinds of consciousness:</p>
<p>㊀ The Attitude of a Scholar: If you do not have the attitude of a scholar when serving society, not only will you not receive developmental achievements in your career, but you will also inevitably feel the pain of mechanical life in your career, a perfunctory job. If you serve society with the eyes of a scholar, you will feel interested at every moment. The pursuit of life, exploring its cause, pursuing its research, serving for decades is equal to one day, and at the same time the career is progressing day by day.</p>
<p>㊁ The Mind of a Child: The mind of a child can be said to be pure, curious, enthusiastic, forward-looking, and humble. If we, as members serving society, all have the heart of a child, corrupt officials and old clerks, engaging in private gain and fraud, will not arise. The actions of children are based on conscience, and they will not be hypocritical, flattering, or despicable when treating people and things. Therefore, the heart of a child, if adults never lose the good heart of a child, their lives will be more poetic and happy day by day. So let the mind of a child burn! Let it be hidden in the hearts of people serving society! That's right.</p>
<h3>Standards for Choosing Nutritious Foods for Tuberculosis Patients</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis (commonly known as consumption, phthisis) is a type of wasting disease. It is caused by the active invasion of tubercle bacilli into the human body, resulting in impaired systemic nourishment. Consequently, patients gradually become emaciated and weak, exhibiting a haggard and frail appearance. If no urgent measures are taken to remedy and maintain their condition, the situation will inevitably worsen, eventually leading to a point of no return, like a lamp running out of oil. Therefore, to compensate for their depletion and maintain their nutrition, we must choose and consume foods rich in nourishment. Only then can we speak of nutritional therapy.</p>
<p>However, if patients are not careful and indiscriminately consume food in an attempt to increase their weight and replenish their losses, it is like supplying inferior coal to a locomotive. The result will only be a sharp reduction in driving speed, delaying important matters. From this, it can be seen that the selection of nutritious foods for tuberculosis patients is indeed a crucial and significant hinge, and one that deserves careful attention. The standards are now listed below for the reference of doctors and patients:</p>
<p>(A) Milk</p>
<p>The benefits of milk for tuberculosis have long been recognized. Aretaeus elucidated this principle eight hundred years ago. Milk is extremely rich in protein, and its quality is also excellent. Furthermore, the various amino acids it provides are essential components for nourishment. Therefore, doctors often recommend milk as a nourishing food for tuberculosis patients.</p>
<p>In addition, milk also contains a large amount of fat, minerals, and vitamins, including vitamins A, B, and C. One pound of milk has the same metabolic combustion value in the human body as one pound of lean meat or eight eggs. Who would say it is not a standard and most economical nutritious food? For ordinary patients, an average of one to two pounds of milk can be consumed daily.</p>
<p>Patients who cannot tolerate raw milk often experience abdominal pain, bloating, belching, and diarrhea after consumption, leading doctors to suspect ulcerative enteritis. However, if milk is discontinued when these symptoms occur, the symptoms can be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, a saline solution, such as adding one-fifth to three-fifths of limewater to dilute the milk, can be used to avoid the presentation of indigestion symptoms. Sometimes, mixing it with finely ground rice cereal or rice porridge makes it easier to digest.</p>
<p>According to Atwater's experiments, when milk is taken alone, the digestion rate is 92.2% for protein, 86.3% for carbohydrates, and 92.8% for fat. However, when taken with bread, the digestive power increases to 97.1% for protein, 98.7% for carbohydrates, and 95% for fat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the minerals contained in milk are also abundant, and they are all essential components that should not be lacking in the daily nutritious food of tuberculosis patients.</p>
<p>(B) Eggs</p>
<p>Eggs are extremely important in the nutritious food of tuberculosis patients because they are rich in protein, fat, and minerals. Whole eggs contain 75% water, 13% protein, and 12% fat. In total, the egg white accounts for two-thirds and the yolk accounts for one-third.</p>
<p>A whole egg weighing 50 grams has the same nutritional value as 35 grams of beef or 128 grams of milk. The yolk contains 25% fat and 15% protein, as well as nuclein, lecithin, iron, other salts, and cholesterol, which have the effect of strengthening the body and nourishing the blood.</p>
<p>One pound of egg white can produce 250 heat units (calories), while one pound of egg yolk can produce 1,700 heat units. In other words, one pound of eggs can produce more than 700 heat units.</p>
<p>We all know that excessive fat consumption often leads to liver congestion, and excessive meat consumption easily causes kidney congestion. The harm of excessive egg consumption is equivalent to that of excessive fat and meat consumption.</p>
<p>Ordinary patients often like to eat raw eggs, believing they have greater nutritional value. However, according to research, raw eggs are not easily digested and can even cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Egg white that is heated to 37 degrees Celsius is easier to digest. Furthermore, patients whose stomach and liver functions are disordered and cannot tolerate eggs should not be forced to eat them, as it will be more harmful than beneficial, which is neither what doctors want nor what patients enjoy.</p>
<p>Occasionally, some people have a specific sensitivity to eggs, and even eating one egg can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. This is an exceptional phenomenon, and stopping consumption will cure it. There is no need to fear. Those whose stomach, liver, and other organ functions are not disordered can eat four to six eggs daily, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>(C) Soy Milk</p>
<p>Soy milk (commonly known as tofu whey) is made from ground soybeans and water. Its value as a nourishing product has long been recognized by the Chinese. Soybeans contain the most protein of all grains, and their content is no less than that of meat. However, they contain very little fat. Therefore, it can be used to replace milk for those who dislike milk or have a specific sensitivity to it. In addition to milk, tuberculosis patients can still consume soy milk once or twice a day. It is also a cheap, high-quality, and universally economical nutritious food. The analysis of its components is as follows:</p>
<p>Fat: 2.5%</p>
<p>Protein: 5.4%</p>
<p>Carbohydrates: 1.2%</p>
<p>Water: 90.9%</p>
<p>(D) Protein</p>
<p>In tuberculosis patients, the action of tubercle bacilli causes toxemia, which severely destroys and damages human tissues, especially muscles. To compensate for this, an appropriate amount of protein must be introduced. Approximately 1.5 grams to 1.75 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is needed daily. Animal protein is better than plant protein because animal protein is more easily assimilated in the human body.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis patients can eat an average of three-quarters to one pound of animal food per day. However, the most suitable and complete food is one pound of bread (or an appropriate amount of rice), three eggs, two pounds of milk, eight ounces of tomatoes, four ounces of fresh vegetables, and one pound of fruit. One pound of beef contains about two to three ounces of protein, and one pound of fresh halibut or cod contains one and a half to two and a half ounces of protein.</p>
<p>(E) Fat, Carbohydrates, and Minerals</p>
<p>Fat is also an important nutritious food, with cream cheese, milk butter, etc., being the best. Their effect is similar to that of cod liver oil, but it is not advisable to eat them directly.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates are indispensable nutritious foods because they are easily digested and assimilated in the human body.</p>
<p>As for minerals such as iron, calcium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphorus, they are extremely important elements in human blood and tissues and can be obtained from various foods to nourish the human body.</p>
<p>(F) Vitamins</p>
<p>Vitamins were not valued by doctors until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Researchers generally believe that nutritious foods, in addition to protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals, also contain more important nutritional elements that are necessary for human health. In 1905, Pekelharing fed mice cheese protein, rice flour, lard, water, and salt. As a result, the mice still starved to death despite having food. Later, when he replaced the water with milk, the mice became lively and healthy. He concluded that milk must contain an incredibly important nutritious component that is essential for the human body. Later, in 1912, McCollum and Davis discovered vitamin A through experiments, which has an extremely</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>important effect on human health. Lack of this substance makes the human body susceptible to infectious diseases. Later medical research revealed that it is also extremely important for tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Vitamin B is also extremely valuable for tuberculosis because it has a special effect on the motor nerves in the human body. Research has shown that tuberculosis patients who lack vitamin B are prone to insomnia. Furthermore, patients often develop beriberi during the course of tuberculosis, and the prognosis is often poor. Therefore, to prevent this, they should eat more foods rich in vitamin B.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is a common tonic and has a beneficial effect when used for tuberculosis. Schraaedre proved that vitamin C deficiency is inevitable when suffering from tuberculosis. Hasselbach further proved this through various examinations, stating that hemoptysis in tuberculosis patients is caused by increased capillary permeability, resulting in mild, moderate, and easily recurrent hemoptysis. Taking more vitamin C can reduce bleeding.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is extremely important for the absorption and metabolic regulation of calcium and phosphorus in human blood and bones. Therefore, taking it helps tuberculosis patients by causing the lung damage to tend toward calcification and promoting and assisting in the gradual reduction of the disease.</p>
<p>Most tuberculosis patients need the following average daily food intake:</p>
<p>(1) Protein: 100 grams</p>
<p>(2) Fat: 80 to 100 grams</p>
<p>(3) Carbohydrates: 400 to 500 grams</p>
<p>The various components contained in nutritious foods and the heat they supply are listed below.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>3.  Japanese Swertia (Swertia japonica, Makino)</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows wild in the mountains and fields and is a biennial herb. The stem has many branches, is square, and can reach up to 20 cm in height. The leaves are opposite, without stalks, and are narrowly linear with entire margins. In autumn, white flowers grow at the top or from the axils. The corolla is deeply divided into five lobes and has purple stripes. The capsule is linear. The entire plant has a prominent bitter taste.</p>
<p>Chinese Swertia (S. Chineosis, Hemel, et Forbes) closely resembles Japanese Swertia. It is slightly larger, and the branches are also shorter and thicker. The flowers are purple.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Swertia Herb (Herba Swertiae) is the entire plant of the above two species, collected and dried during the flowering period. This product is up to 20 cm long. The stem is square and dark purple. The branches and leaves are arranged oppositely. The roots are yellowish and quite thin, with numerous divisions. The leaves are narrowly linear, without stalks, and entirely green. It has an extremely bitter taste.</p>
<p>(Components) The bitter component is Swertiamarin C16H22O10, a crystalline glycoside with a content of 2.4%. This substance, due to the action of acid and Emulsin, undergoes hydrolysis, as in the following formula:</p>
<p>C16H22O10 + H2O → C6H12O6 (Glucose) + C10H10O5 (Erythrocentaurin) + 2H2O</p>
<p>Erythrocentaurin is directly detected from the plant. If it is hydrolyzed from the glycoside, it may not be generated. This substance is originally a colorless crystal, but it turns red when exposed to sunlight, which is its characteristic.</p>
<p>It also contains Swertiasaure C27H42O3, Gentisin C14H10O5, Swertisin C13H10O6, and other tasteless crystalline substances.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Swertia (as described in ancient medical texts) is used exclusively as a bitter stomachic and to make stomachic powder.</p>
<p>Oleaceae Family</p>
<p>1.  Forsythia (Forsythia Susdensa,vabi)</p>
<p>(Plant) It originates in China and can be cultivated everywhere. It is a deciduous shrub. The branches are slightly vine-like. The leaves have stalks and are ovate, often with three lobes and serrated edges. In spring, small yellow flowers bloom at the ends of the leaves. The capsule is ovate.</p>
<p>Korean Forsythia (F. viridissima, Lind.) originates in Korea and has slightly smaller flowers than the previous species. The flower stalk is also shorter.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Forsythia Fruit (Fructus Forsythice) is its fruit, collected and dried. This product is ovate, with a sharp tip, and approximately 2.5 cm long. The surface is light brown and has many small raised dots, appearing dirty gray, with deep longitudinal grooves. Mature ones generally split into two, revealing flat, slender seeds. It has a fragrant aroma and is astringent.</p>
<p>(Components) The herb contains phyllirin, a glycoside similar to this substance.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) According to old texts, Forsythia treats scabies, scrofula, sores, etc. It is used as an internal medicine and is highly valued.</p>
<p>Prescription Example: Forsythia Decoction, used to treat measles, chickenpox, and suppurative boils.</p>
<p>Forsythia, Scutellaria baicalensis, Ephedra, Cimicifuga, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, 1.5 each.</p>
<p>Rhubarb,枳實 (Zhishi, immature fruit of Citrus aurantium), 2.5 each.</p>
<p>The above eight ingredients are decocted into 200 ml and taken three times a day.</p>
<h3>Developing Medicine Requires the Chinese People to Understand New Medicine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xia Chengdao</p>
<p>As for the saying that "old doctors have unique skills," this is easy to answer and is the most important key. Old doctors only know how to treat diseases with medicine, but they do not know that medicinal products are not absolutely necessary for treating diseases. The Chinese people must know that medicinal treatment only occupies a part of the position in the treatment, in addition to drug therapy, there are also nourishing therapy, balneotherapy, cold therapy, heat therapy, climate therapy, mineral spring therapy, air therapy, barometric pressure therapy, sun therapy, high mountain therapy, artificial light therapy, radium therapy, psychotherapy, blood transfusion therapy, and so on, countless therapies, all of which are the most ingenious and precise scientific products. How could an old doctor sitting in a well and looking at the sky dream of this? The so-called unique skills of old doctors are only in drug therapy, after thousands of years of experience, such as being able to stop pain, rhubarb can lower the stool, they do not understand what the reason is, but also know its use, is to know what is, but do not know why. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, said it well, "It is easy to do what you know, and you can do what you do not know." The old doctor knows what is, which is why the old doctor has no experience. If the drugs with thousands of years of experience in our country (including the so-called secret recipes and the family recipes that are passed down to men but not to women) can be studied with scientific methods, it will definitely make a great contribution to the world's medicine. Only then can the essence of the country be carried forward, and only then can the country be glorious!</p>
<p>Old doctors must replenish the kidneys when treating spermatorrhea. It is really ridiculous to say that old doctors think that sperm comes from the kidneys, so in the pharmacies, kidney-tonifying pills and essence-solidifying pills are advertised in a flurry of rhetoric, but they do not know that sperm comes from the seminal vesicles, and the nerves are weak, and the seminal vesicles are not managed properly, so that the semen is easily lost. The kidney is the filter tank of blood and the place where urine is produced, which is the so-called excretion organ. If you suffer from spermatorrhea and do not treat it, it is the source of nerve weakness. Specializing in tonifying the kidneys is really irrelevant!</p>
<p>The old doctor said that "the heart is the master of thought and perception," which is another joke. How did they know the function of the heart, like the water pump of a water company, which sends blood to the whole body by contracting and relaxing, presiding over the circulation of blood? All of this is based on many experiments. According to the old doctor's theory, the brain is simply a waste. Why don't they dig out the brain, which is a heavy waste on their heads?</p>
<p>Old doctors still cannot clearly understand the functions of their own human organs. How can they be qualified to be doctors? For example, if a clock repairman does not understand the structure of the clock and the functions of each part, you will definitely not want to give him a valuable clock for repair. Occasionally, he will add a little oil, and the clock will be able to run as a result. This is his little experience, which is the effect of oil. This does not mean that he has the skills to repair clocks!</p>
<p>In summary, the old doctor's metaphysical theories of yin and yang are completely wrong. In this scientific world, the Chinese people should correct them. Their thousands of years of experience in drug treatment is useful to a certain extent. In other words, "China originally had no medicine, only drugs," that is, the theory of old doctors should be eliminated, and Chinese medicine should not only be preserved, but also studied and manufactured by scientific methods, so that it can be exported to other countries for the treatment of the world.</p>
<p>Decades ago, the situation in the medical and pharmaceutical circles in Japan was the same as in China today. What's more, people who advocated scientific medicine were shot. Finally, due to the progress and struggle of the scientific community, and the Chinese people's ability to take the overall interests of the country as their goal, have a long-term vision, and humbly accept the world's science, used to build the country, and reorganize medicine, the whole country united, and today Japan's medical and pharmaceutical industry has squeezed into an important position in the international arena, competing with Germany, Britain and the United States. Looking back at the national conditions of our old and backward country, it really makes patriotic people heartbroken!</p>
<p>Whether the country's politics can be on the right track depends on the level and vision of the people. From the beginning, the government officials of our country thought that they understood everything, talked about everything, were capable of everything, and specialized in everything, but as a result, they specialized in nothing, and held many positions, which only delayed the country's affairs. The national administration has thousands of things to attend to, and although people are the spirit of all things, their spirit is limited, their time is fixed, and only division of labor and cooperation, the more detailed the division of labor, the more specialized the career, the more sufficient the spirit, the greater the efficiency, the faster the progress, and the prosperity of the country and the strengthening of the army can be achieved as soon as possible. In summary, now that we have entered the era of tutelage and construction, we should do meticulous work. In other words, in this construction period, we need to use ingenious and meticulous tools—specialized talents in various subjects and categories—in order to truly and effectively build the country from a wasteland!</p>

<p>In modern countries, health undertakings are really one of the most important administrations, because the international status often depends on the health of a country's nation. Our country has been weak for a long time, and if we want to gain a foothold in the international arena, we must seek the prosperity of the nation. If we want to seek the prosperity of the nation, we must first complete the construction of health.</p>
<p>In recent years, European and American countries not only advocate health undertakings in front of the government, but also support them in the rear. Once an infectious disease occurs, the people all have common sense of isolation, disinfection, and prevention, and can abide by the guidance of health administrative organs and prevent it according to law, so the disease rate and mortality rate have significantly decreased.</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has been actively promoting health construction, but it has not yet been popularized. Health undertakings, small things are related to personal interests, and big things are related to the rise and fall of the nation, which cannot be ignored and should be studied.</p>
<p>Hospitals and clinics have been widely established in various urban and rural areas of our city, and the equipment is gradually becoming perfect, but it still focuses on treatment, and on the facilities for the prevention of epidemics, such as spring smallpox vaccination and cholera vaccine injection, although they are implemented free of charge every year and are effective, but such as maternal and child health, and health education, etc., still need to be actively promoted; In order to make the various health facilities in our city more perfect, we should consult widely and use it for reference, which is the main purpose of Jinfang's assignment to inspect health.</p>
<p>The locations of this inspection include Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Hankou, Wuchang, and Changsha. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct a detailed investigation; however, I was able to get a glimpse of the important parts. Now, I will respectfully prepare a report on the inspection situation in the order of the itinerary:</p>

<h3>Italian Soldiers Destroy Shanghai Grand Theatre: Municipal Government Lodges Protest Yesterday</h3>
<p>Besides Demanding Punishment for the Offending Italian Soldiers, [the Government] Reserves the Right to Claim Compensation for Losses; Consul Has Not Expressed Any Opinion, Details Carried in Various Newspapers; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Also Lodges Protest with the Italian Embassy</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, regarding the case of Italian soldiers destroying the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road, it is reported that the Municipal Government officially lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consulate in Shanghai at 5:30 PM yesterday, arguing that such violent acts by Italian soldiers, such as destroying the theatre, releasing tear gas, injuring the projectionist, and seizing the film, are sufficient to endanger the lives and property of residents. Besides demanding punishment for the offending Italian soldiers, the government also reserves the right to claim compensation for losses. It is reported that although there is no precise estimate of the theater's losses, they are estimated to be around 65,000 yuan. The theatre has decided to temporarily suspend operations until a resolution is reached. It is also reported that the theatre has fire insurance with a certain British insurance company, and the company also sent personnel to the theatre yesterday to investigate the situation and determine whether it should bear any responsibility.</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Niro, immediately ordered all personnel in the consulate to refrain from expressing any opinions regarding the case. Therefore, when reporters from the Shen Shi News Agency went to the consulate, they were unable to obtain any information. Subsequently, when reporters requested to meet with the Vice Consul, Mr. Tianlei, and the Commercial Attaché, Mr. Qiuqi, they were told that both had already left Shanghai, and their current whereabouts could not be disclosed.</p>
<p>According to a Nanjing dispatch, the Shanghai Municipal Government has reported the details of the case of Italian sailors destroying the Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telegram. According to Nanjing news last night, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the Italian Embassy in China.</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, the Italian sailors who destroyed the Shanghai Grand Theatre should be punished by Rear Admiral Basica, the commander of the Italian Navy in the Far East. Last night (the 20th), Mr. Basica stated on the gunboat Lepanto that he had not yet received any complaints regarding the actions of his sailors. He only learned about the details of the riot after reading the newspaper. He has only been stationed in Shanghai for less than three weeks and is naturally not familiar with the local political situation. However, regardless, he should first maintain military discipline. He is currently investigating the case. Mr. Basica also stated firmly that Italian soldiers stationed abroad generally behave well. The Lepanto only has eighty sailors, so the number of Italian soldiers who participated in the disturbance must be far less than initially expected. Furthermore, neither the Italian Embassy nor the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai has issued any official statement regarding the case. Repairs to the Greater Shanghai Theatre are currently underway. It is reported that the two injured Russian staff members are gradually recovering from their injuries yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, regarding the case of Italian sailors destroying the Greater Shanghai Theatre, it is reported that no one has been arrested so far. It is not yet known what actions the Italian Consul General in Shanghai and the Commander of the Italian Navy in the Far East will take regarding this case. The Soviet Consul General in Shanghai also declines to comment on the case at this time. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government has lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consul General. Although rumors are rampant, all parties concerned are currently unwilling to formally criticize the case.</p>
<p>According to the Foreign Press Agency, on Saturday (the 20th) afternoon, the Shanghai Grand Theatre was destroyed by Italian soldiers while screening a film about Abyssinia. At the time, a Frenchman was present at the screening and witnessed the destruction. According to his report to this newspaper (referring to a French newspaper), "When the film started, I (the Frenchman referring to himself, the same applies below) was watching from the balcony. At first, there was nothing unusual. However, when the Abyssinian King appeared in the "Abyssinia" film, the Chinese audience applauded loudly. Then, a foreigner in plain clothes sitting in the front row of the balcony blew a whistle, and the film's projection light was immediately blocked by someone using clothing. At the same time, someone in the entire venue started throwing ammonia gas, intending to force the audience to leave. Thereupon, the lights in the venue were turned on, and I saw Italian soldiers in uniform, all over the place, holding wooden sticks and weaving tubes, engaged in destruction. Many of the seats in the venue were smashed. In the front row of the balcony, there was a foreigner, with what looked like a scar beside his eye, acting as the commander, issuing orders in Italian. The audience, suddenly alarmed by this, almost went crazy and, under the intimidation of the Italian soldiers, gradually left. At this time, I also saw a group of Italian soldiers and Italian civilians in plain clothes continuing to throw ammonia gas, but in reality, this gas was not harmful. I also suddenly heard a shout coming from upstairs. Looking up, I saw a group of soldiers, holding crowbars and carrying film reels, coming down the stairs from the projection room and walking away through the crowd. At that time, I left the theatre and saw several Chinese policemen nearby, maintaining order. However, there were certainly too few of them, and they could not interfere. In fact, I did not hear any gunshots. It seems that some people had foreseen this incident. On February 11th, Reuters had a dispatch from Rome, stating that because of the screening of the Abyssinian film, Italy intervened, based on a Sino-Italian film agreement, in which both sides guaranteed that films detrimental to either country would not be screened in their respective territories. However, this news has not been confirmed and seems to be a rumor. However, this destruction has now occurred. This is the third time that Italian soldiers have used force to interfere with anti-Italian films in Shanghai. Eight years ago, they seized an American film at the Xian Lu Theatre and publicly burned it on the Zha Pu Road Bridge. In 1934, they also forcibly seized a film about the European War that mentioned the defeat of Italian soldiers at the Carlton Theatre. Afterwards, these incidents were resolved amicably by the Public Concession authorities and the Italian Consulate General."</p>
<h3>Fifth Anniversary of Major Short's Righteous Death</h3>
<p>Public Memorial Service Held Yesterday by Various Sectors</p>
<p>Major Short, an American aviator, driven by righteous indignation during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, bravely took to the skies in his plane to fight six enemy warplanes over Suzhou. He fought valiantly, but ultimately died due to the overwhelming odds. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese people mourned and admired him. Appreciating Mr. Short's righteous courage, the Chinese government later built a tomb for Mr. Short beside the Hongqiao Aerodrome in this city and erected a monument to commemorate him. Today marks the fifth anniversary of Mr. Short's death. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, various sectors of this city held a public memorial service in front of Mr. Short's tomb at the Hongqiao Aerodrome. Attendees included Tong Xingbai from the City Party Headquarters, Li Dachao from the Shanghai Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association, Huang Yanpei from the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai Air Defense Association, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Boy Scouts Council, the Su District Tax Police Bureau, the Hongqiao Air Force Station, and representatives from other groups, totaling over a hundred people. The City Party Headquarters, Garrison Headquarters, Naval Headquarters, China Aviation Construction Association, Shanghai Branch, Local Association, Air Force Station, Municipal Education Association, and other groups officiated at the ceremony, offering wreaths and performing the rituals. F.Y. Wagner, representing Mr. Short's family, delivered a speech, stating that she had come to Shanghai from the United States on behalf of Mr. Short's mother to participate in today's public memorial service. She was very pleased to see representatives from all sectors of China gathered here to pay tribute, and that the Chinese government had not forgotten Mr. Short's contributions. She would relay this information to Mr. Short's mother to comfort her and hoped that this spirit of righteousness would be perpetuated forever. Afterwards, the entire group took a photo and dispersed.</p>

<h3>First American Vessel Arrives After Strike</h3>
<p>Service Resumes After Seventy Days of Suspension; First Ship is the President Hoover</p>
<p>After the American sailors' strike, American vessels in the Pacific suspended their voyages. Since the last arrival in Shanghai of the President McKinley on November 14th of last year, it has been seventy days without any American ships entering the port. The strike has also affected the arrival of American cargo in Shanghai for a long time. Since the sailors resumed work, the first American vessel to cross the Pacific to China is the President Hoover, a regular mail ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines from San Francisco to Shanghai. This ship is fully loaded with cargo and passengers from America to Shanghai, via Honolulu and Japan. It was telegraphed yesterday that it is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning. This is the first American ship to resume service to Shanghai after the seventy-day suspension, and it is also the first batch of American goods shipped from San Francisco to Chinese ports. Yesterday, various American merchants and trading firms inquired with the shipping company about the arrival time, preparing to pick up their cargo. Furthermore, it was telegraphed yesterday that the President Wilson is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Decision Made on Method for Reducing Rickshaws and Sharing Costs</h3>
<p>Notification Issued to All Members to Comply</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of reducing the number of rickshaws in the Public Concession, an agreement was signed by both parties to extend the implementation date to June 1st. The rickshaw guild in the Special District decided on a method for reducing rickshaws and sharing costs at a meeting yesterday and issued a notification to all members to comply. The original text reads: "Notification regarding the following matter: As per the resolution of the general meeting of rickshaw owners at this office, an agreement has been reached with the Municipal Council to extend the deadline for reducing rickshaws from December 1st to June 1st. This office is responsible for handling the matter. All rickshaw owners will share the cost of reducing 484 rickshaws. The method for sharing costs has been decided as follows. Please comply: ㊀ All rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates, regardless of the number of rickshaws they own, must submit all their rickshaw owner certificates to this office for registration by February 26th. This office will issue a receipt, which can be used to pay the relevant fees at the designated bank and enjoy the benefits of the extended rickshaw reduction program managed by this office. Otherwise, the Municipal Council will deduct the licenses based on the number of rickshaws owned by the rickshaw owner, starting from March 1st through a lottery. ㊁ Rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for one to ten rickshaws must pay monthly license and guild fees of 3.69 yuan in national currency and a rickshaw reduction sharing fee of 5 yuan in national currency at the bank from the 1st to the 6th of March, April, and May of this year, using the rickshaw owner certificate receipt issued by this office. They must then present the two bank receipts to this office to receive the license and operate. ㊂ Rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for eleven or more rickshaws must sign a guarantee at this office by February 26th and pay a rickshaw sharing fee of 15 yuan in national currency per rickshaw. Only then will this office stamp the rickshaw owner certificate receipt with the words "rickshaw sharing," allowing them to pay monthly license and guild fees of 3.69 yuan in national currency at the designated bank from the 1st to the 6th of March, April, and May of this year. They must then present the bank receipt to this office to receive the license and operate. After May 10th, the rickshaws to be shared will be determined, and the signed guarantees and rickshaw sharing fees will be exchanged. ㊃ If a rickshaw owner holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for one to ten rickshaws has multiple certificates in the name of one person, one family, or one company, with the total number of rickshaws exceeding eleven, and wishes to share the rickshaws instead of paying the fees, they must apply to this office before February 26th. Only after approval will they be allowed to proceed in the same manner as rickshaw owners holding Municipal Council rickshaw owner certificates for eleven or more rickshaws. ㊄ If a rickshaw needs to be replaced due to being stolen within a specified period and the owner wishes to use it to offset the rickshaw reduction requirement, the small ticket number of the stolen rickshaw must be submitted to this office for registration at any time to be reported to the authorities, allowing for an exemption from replacement and for it to be used to offset the rickshaw reduction requirement."</p>
<h3>Siamese Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Chune, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Conditions for Overseas Chinese in Siam are Very Good; Hoping for Early Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Siam</p>
<p>Mr. Chune Pintvanon, Secretary of the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who is on his way to Japan to inspect consular affairs, passed through Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3 PM aboard the French mail ship Felix Roussel. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the delegation to Siam welcomed him at the wharf. Mr. Chune also met with reporters and made a statement, which is recorded below by a Central News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Arrival at Port</p>
<p>The Felix Roussel was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but due to fog in the Wusongkou, it was delayed until 3 PM in the afternoon before arriving at the China Merchants North Bund Wharf. Those who went to welcome him included Yu Ming, Special Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang, Director and Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Kanghou, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to Siam, delegation members Li Gan, Xu Ge Ting, standing committee member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Zhisheng and Madam Miao Zhongxiu, and others, more than ten people in total.</p>
<p>Departure for Japan Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings with the welcoming party, Mr. Chune went directly to the New Asia Hotel to rest. At 8 PM that evening, Lin Kanghou, Deputy Head of the Delegation to Siam, delegation members Yu Ming, Li Gan, Wang Zhixin, and others, as a show of hospitality and to thank him for his previous hospitality, jointly hosted a banquet at the International Hotel with Zhou Jue, Zhao Tiezhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to welcome Mr. Chune. Lin Kanghou, as chairman, delivered a welcoming speech. Today, Mr. Chune will be accompanied by Yu Ming to visit the construction in the city center. If the mayor returns to Shanghai, he will also visit the mayor. Mr. Chune is scheduled to depart for Japan on the original ship tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Chune's Statement</p>
<p>Mr. Chune met with reporters on board the ship and stated that his trip to Japan was to inspect the situation of the consulate in Japan and is expected to last for more than a month. He will come to China again at the end of April and will stay for a while and visit the authorities in Beijing. Before passing through Shanghai, he had visited Singapore, Penang, the Dutch East Indies, Hong Kong and other places to inspect the consular situation. The situation of Chinese compatriots in Siam is very good. The Siamese government treats overseas Chinese the same as its own people. Regarding diplomatic relations between China and Siam, he also hopes that they can be established as soon as possible. (Note: Mr. Chune is an important member of the Siamese New Party and has made significant contributions to the revolution in the past.)</p>

<h3>Zheng Baozhao Discusses Inspection of Rice Panic in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Annual Shortage of 10 Million Dan; Each Yuan Can Only Buy Six Jin</p>
<p>Liang Dingshu, Section Chief of the Rural Economics Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Lin Xichun, Section Chief, Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Shen Guojin, Section Chief, Wu Enzhi, Staff Member, Shi Jingchong and others, who were dispatched to Guangdong to inspect the rice shortage situation, have completed their work and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2 PM aboard the French mail ship Felix Roussel. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed Director Zheng on board the ship, and his statement is as follows: He was dispatched to Guangdong by order of the Ministry of Finance to investigate the rice shortage in Guangdong Province. Following Minister Kong's instructions, he first visited Wuhu at the end of last month and discussed with the Yuehan Railway the matter of increasing the number of trains to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong for relief. He then departed on the British mail ship on the 2nd of this month and arrived in Guangdong on the 5th. In Guangzhou, he repeatedly visited with various party, government, and military leaders of Guangdong, as well as leaders of the financial sector and organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and the rice industry, to listen to their opinions and convey Minister Kong's concern for the people's food supply in Guangdong Province. Guangdong Province has always been a rice-deficient province. According to investigations, it is short of approximately 8 million to 10 million dan of rice per year. Last year, the situation was even worse due to poor harvests of early, late, summer, and autumn rice crops in Guangdong, and the scarcity of foreign rice from Siam, South Vietnam, Burma, and other places due to active purchases by various countries around the world. Therefore, in November and December of last year and January of this year, there was no foreign rice market in Guangzhou. At the same time, various rice-producing provinces in China mostly prohibited rice exports. Although the central government issued a clear order to lift the ban and ordered the transport of rice to Guangdong for relief as much as possible, it was not enough to make up for the shortage in time, resulting in the food panic in Guangdong Province. The price of rice in Guangzhou in September of last year was already about 5 to 6 jiao per dan higher than in August. The price then rose gradually. In November, the market price of high-quality rice was 8 jin per yuan, and second-quality rice was 9.4 jin per yuan. By mid-January of this year, high-quality rice was only selling for slightly more than 6 jin per yuan, medium-quality rice for slightly more than 7 jin, and lower-quality rice for only 8 jin per yuan, which was the highest price in recent years. Subsequently, Minister Kong requested the government to order Hunan and Anhui rice to be transported to Guangdong for relief, and also ordered this bureau and the Central Trust Bureau to purchase Wuhu rice and transport it there. After approving the half-tax recording of 1 million dan of imported foreign rice, the price of rice in Guangzhou fell, and the degree of panic also gradually eased, which is not consistent with the situation reported outside. Therefore, the Guangdong authorities and people's organizations are very grateful to Minister Kong. Guangdong has now established a People's Food Adjustment Committee, which is actively purchasing rice from Hunan, Anhui, and Guangxi provinces and distributing it to twelve rice merchants in the city to conduct price stabilization and provide relief. There is no fear of panic in the near future. All the findings of this investigation will be compiled into a report and submitted to Beijing within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Jiang Dingwen Goes to Zhejiang to Meet Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Dingwen, member of the Central Executive Committee, attended the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in Beijing. He left Beijing by special express train on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and arrived at the North Railway Station at 10:20 PM that night. He went directly to his private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. Then, at 8:25 AM yesterday morning, he took the Shanghai-Hangzhou early train to Hangzhou. Mr. Jiang will go to Fenghua to meet with Mr. Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<h3>Xu Ge Ting Returns to Shanghai to Talk About the Forthcoming Establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association</h3>
<p>Negotiating with National Goods Company; Considering Navigation Between China and Siam</p>
<p>Xu Ge Ting, standing committee member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, recently went to Beijing to visit the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry to discuss matters such as the Sino-Siamese Association, Sino-Siamese navigation, and the development of national goods. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his work. A Central News Agency reporter interviewed him, and his statement is as follows:</p>
<p>The Sino-Siamese Association is About to be Established</p>
<p>Mr. Xu said that during his visit to Beijing, he visited Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ling Bing, Head of the Delegation to Siam, and made requests regarding the establishment of the Sino-Siamese Association in China. The purpose of this association is to seek the development of trade and culture between China and Siam. Siam has already established it long ago, and China is now actively preparing for it. The personnel have already been determined, about fifty or sixty people. All members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and all members of the delegation to Siam will be ex officio members. Chen Shuren will be the chairman, and ministers of various ministries will be appointed as honorary chairmen. The headquarters will be set up in the capital, and an office will be set up in Shanghai if necessary. It is expected to be established next month.</p>
<p>Negotiating with National Goods Company</p>
<p>There are a large number of Chinese compatriots living in Siam. The compatriots like to use national goods, so the development of national goods is imminent. Chinese merchants hope to establish a national goods company to handle all distribution matters. The National Goods Joint Operating Company of the Ministry of Industry will be established at the end of next month. At that time, the Joint Operating Company will cooperate with Chinese merchants, and the company will be subordinate to the Joint Operating Company. He will now stay in Shanghai to negotiate everything with the leaders of the national goods industry.</p>
<p>Sino-Siamese Navigation is Under Consideration</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Siamese navigation, Mr. Vili, the Siamese commercial officer, once exchanged views with our authorities, intending to establish a shipping company to transport the national products of the two countries, and set the capital at 4 million baht (about 6 million yuan in Chinese currency). This matter is complicated and difficult to realize for a while. The simplest way is to extend the China Merchants Bureau's South China shipping route, which is simple and easy. It is reported that the Bureau is currently considering it. As for the hope that major banks will establish branches in Siam to facilitate remittances, it is reported that a major bank has started investigating the financial situation in Siam and is expected to be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3>Xiao Songqin Arrives in Shanghai from Siam on His Father's Orders</h3>
<p>Visiting the Authorities in Beijing Today</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Songqin, son of Central Executive Committee member Xiao Focheng, (reported as Xiao Songjian in the newspaper), was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Siam to welcome his father back to the country to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. However, Mr. Xiao Focheng was unable to travel because his health had not yet recovered and he was very afraid of the cold. Mr. Xiao Jr. arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th from Siam and went to Guangdong. He took the French mail ship Felix Roussel north from Hong Kong on the 19th to report back. The ship encountered fog on the way and did not arrive in Shanghai until about 3 PM yesterday, mooring at the China Merchants North Bund Wharf on Broadway Road. Lin Kanghou, Wang Zhisheng, and others went to welcome him. After Mr. Xiao Jr. disembarked, he went directly to the New Asia Hotel to rest. Mr. Xiao Jr. brought four letters from his father to Sun, Ju, and Yu, the three heads of the Yuan, and Minister Kong. In addition to thanking them for their kind invitation, the letters stated the reason why he could not come to Beijing. President Jiang had previously telegraphed Mr. Xiao to return to China. It is reported that Mr. Xiao has already telegraphed back. Mr. Xiao Jr. is scheduled to go to Beijing today to report back to the Central Government and visit various dignitaries, representing his father to extend his greetings. It has not yet been decided when he will return to Siam. According to Mr. Xiao Jr., his father suffers from bladder problems, and urination becomes difficult when the weather is slightly cold, so he is very afraid of the cold. A month ago, the weather in Siam was about 95 degrees, but his father was still wearing a leather coat. Therefore, he could not come to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. His father decided to wait until the weather is warm and his health has recovered before returning to China. His father did not have any proposals for the Third Plenary Session, but he had previously sent a long letter to President Ju, conveying his personal opinions on national affairs to the comrades of the Central Government.</p>

<h3>Chinese Overseas in America Invited to Participate in the New York World's Fair</h3>
<p>President of Oberlin College Sends Letter to Minister Kong Requesting Sponsorship - Fujian Hui Nursery's Exhibit Creates International Art World Record</p>
<p>The two representatives who participated in the Chicago World's Fair, Mr. Dong Kunfan and Mr. Dong Guangying, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday. After the Chicago fair closed, the two traveled all over the United States to study education and industry. They arrived in New York, where they were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese, and expressed strong support for the plan to participate in the 1940 New York World's Fair. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of New York specifically resolved to petition the Executive Yuan for sponsorship to ensure tangible results. According to what the two gentlemen told reporters, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chicago Expo Exhibits Highly Praised</p>
<p>China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair has been highly praised by the people there. Representative Dong, who attended on behalf of Fujian Province, said that among China's exhibits, the products of the Fujian Hui Nursery School won the admiration of the entire American press. The Chicago Pictorial News praised it as the focal point of the Chicago Expo. The famous American calligrapher Mr. Li Bo gave a speech at the conference, publicly praising it as creating a record in international art. After the closing of the fair, in response to invitations from various parties and to promote Chinese culture and art, they traveled around, and together with Mr. Ye Keliang, the Consul General in New York, donated more than a dozen silk lacquer statues of Chinese greats to the China-America Association to promote national culture and introduce lacquer statues to Westerners. They donated them to promote good relations, including a portrait of President Franklin, which was donated to Oberlin College and was highly praised. In particular, the president of the university, Mr. Weir Deng, knew that Minister Kong strongly supported this participation, and personally wrote a letter entrusted to them to present to Minister Kong to express his gratitude. A portrait of the scientist Edison was donated to the Edison Academy, a portrait of President Roosevelt was donated to the Roosevelt Memorial Hall, and a portrait of the female educator Jane Addams was donated to the public education center she founded. In addition, portraits of President Hoover, the oil magnate Rockefeller, the automobile magnate Ford, and the steel magnate Schwab were all presented to them in person, and motion pictures were taken.</p>
<p>New York World's Fair Invites Participation</p>
<p>New York will hold the Washington Founding Anniversary Exhibition in 1940 and has invited China to participate. New York is the leading city in the United States and the center of world trade. Participating in the expo in the future will be an excellent opportunity to promote national glory and sell domestic products. We have drafted a plan for the authorities to adopt, planning to use Fujian's existing silk and lacquerware to create relief murals, divided into past and present aspects. The past includes the Yellow Emperor's invention of the compass chariot, the Qin Shi Huang's construction of the Great Wall, etc. The modern includes Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of revolution, up to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's northern expedition from Shaoguan, and the national unification, etc., with more than 20 pictures in four styles of Chinese calligraphy. We will adopt the essence of the murals in the Italian Pavilion at the Chicago Expo and the Japanese Shotoku Memorial Picture Gallery, as well as the historical murals of Roosevelt's meeting with the American Defense Family in the White House, extracting what can be used as our reference to promote and carry forward our inherent style. At the same time, we will develop durable lacquer materials, thereby improving and developing the future of Fujian lacquer. In addition to participating in the New York World's Fair, this work will be listed as a basic exhibit for participating in exhibitions in various countries. After the closing ceremony, it should be transported back to China and displayed in the Capital Museum or Art Gallery for the public to view, echoing the Japanese Shotoku Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Petition for Support</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Americas strongly support this plan and have sent a letter to the Executive Yuan stating, "The United States 1939 World's Fair has been decided to open in New York in May of this year, with meticulous preparations and a grand scale.

Mr. Dong and others, with their experience and the results of this investigation, are confident in the 1939 participation plan. We respectfully request that your government strongly support this participation, which will not only bring glory overseas but also benefit the livelihood of the people."

<h3>Commander of the U.S. Patrol Fleet, Marquis, Will Take Office Today</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Marquis, the new commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday on the transport ship Hunter Liggett. The inauguration ceremony is scheduled to take place at 10:00 am this morning on the warship Luzon. Mr. Marquis was formerly the commander of the Sixteenth Naval District and the Cavite Naval Shipyard in the Philippines. The current commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, Rear Admiral Allan, has been in office for two years and will return to the United States with his family to take up his new position soon after the handover. The arrival of the Hunter Liggett is of great help to the U.S. Naval Reserve in Shanghai, because since the U.S. shipping strike, the group of people who retired and received pensions have not received remittances of monthly salaries sent from the United States for two months. The ship will stay briefly in Wusong to allow several officers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment to land, and then it will sail to Qinhuangdao, because the ship carries officers and soldiers of the U.S. Embassy and some U.S. troops stationed in Tianjin, who need to be sent to replace the soldiers whose current term has expired. Then, around the 28th of this month, it will carry several hundred white soldiers to Shanghai to replenish the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Issues Notice on Withholding Tax Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance Affairs Office yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that it had received Instruction No. 109 from the Ministry of Finance Income Tax Affairs Office regarding the first category of profit-making business income tax and store employee salary income tax, stipulating three withholding methods, which are excerpted below: (1) In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, the first category of Class A and Class B profit-making businesses should be settled once a year and report their income within three months after the settlement. The start and end dates of the business year should be determined by the customs of each industry. The old habits of using three or five years as the settlement period should be abolished. (2) The office will not intervene in whether or not interest should be stipulated for the shares of store owners, but the net profit should be calculated first at the end of each accounting period, and the tax payable should be reserved in advance in accordance with the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the regulations before dividends can be distributed. (3) The practice of long-term advances for store employees is a kind of habit and seems not easy to abolish, but if the salary is calculated on a monthly basis, then the income of 30 yuan or more per month should be withheld income tax according to law on a monthly basis. If it is calculated on a seasonal, semi-annual, or annual basis, and the average monthly income is 30 yuan or more, then income tax should be withheld when the salary is paid. If the actual amount of salary is not stipulated, but bonuses are distributed at the end of the accounting period, then the corresponding income tax should be calculated and withheld based on the average monthly income when the bonus is paid. The letter is sent to you for your information and to inform all industry associations.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association Sends Letters to Banks to Complete Reporting Procedures</h3>
<p>Reporting Deadline at the End of February - Forms Can Be Obtained from the Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association, in view of the imminent deadline for reporting, specifically sent letters to each bank in the association to quickly complete the reporting procedures. The original letter stated, "It has been learned that Article 46 of the Implementing Rules for the Income Tax stipulates that 'companies, shops, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals should report their names, addresses, business capital or actual share capital to the local competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of these detailed rules.' All reporting forms have been announced by the Shanghai Income Tax Office (Shang Zi No. 1) and distributed by the association on January 15. Subsequently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce negotiated with the Income Tax Affairs Office to extend the deadline to the end of February this year because the deadline at the end of January was too short. There are not many days left before the deadline. I am sincerely afraid that some banks in the association have not yet reported, so I will notify you again. Please complete the reporting procedures within the deadline. If there are no ready-made reporting forms, you can go to the Shanghai Income Tax Office to obtain them. Please check and handle accordingly."</p>

<h3>Forcing Two Girls into Prostitution and Extreme Abuse</h3>
<p>Two Girls Seek Help in Desperation; Chen Shengcai Arrested for Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Shengcai, from Anhui, resides at No. 54, Weixing Lane, Taopeng Road. Between July and August of last year, in collusion with his concubine, Han Landi from Huzhou, he lured Wu Guizhen, a 20-year-old woman, and Sun Anfu, an 18-year-old woman, from Huzhou to Shanghai. Under the pretext of introducing them to work in a cotton mill, he deceived them into staying at a hotel in the middle of Hankou Road and forced the two girls to go to ships in the Shiliupu area to engage in prostitution, catering to customers' desires and spending nights with them. Chen Shengcai and Han Landi received and spent the earnings. Later, when the two girls refused, Chen threatened them with disfigurement by splashing nitric acid on their faces, forcing them to continue their prostitution. Subsequently, due to declining business, they moved to Chang'an Hotel in Yangshupu to sell their bodies. Any slight disobedience was met with beatings, and Wu was even splattered with excrement on her face. The two girls, enduring unbearable suffering, reported the situation to the Jianlin Road Police Station on the previous morning. Detective Xie Wanfang and officer Peng Zhenxuan were dispatched, and Chen was arrested. Upon questioning, it was revealed that his concubine, Han Landi, was hiding at No. 182, Singapore Road, in the Chinese-administered area of Caojiadu. The detectives, together with the local police, apprehended Han and brought her to the station for detention. Yesterday morning, Chen was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. A lawyer from the Public Works Department, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case and requested a postponement to bring Han in for a joint trial. Subsequently, Wu Guizhen and Sun Anfu testified to the events and questioned the defendant, whose statements were evasive. Judge Lu Lin ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Li Weiqing and Others Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Dispute over the Smuggling Intelligence Bureau</p>
<p>Li Weiqing, from Shanxi, who previously served as the director of the Ministry of Finance-approved pilot Smuggling Intelligence Bureau (which had a brief existence last summer before being dissolved) and is currently employed at the Central Bank, was recently sued in a criminal case at the Shanghai District Court by Gan Zhaoting, from Hunan, a former team leader of the Tong, Ru, Hai, Chong, Qi Wang counties district under the bureau. The suit accused Li Weiqing, along with Li's chief of general affairs, Xiong Xiangtao, and secretary, Hu Zhefu, of obtaining money through fraud. The court accepted the case. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Both the plaintiff and the defendants, accompanied by their lawyers, were present in court. Judge Zhang first asked Gan Zhaoting about the purpose of his lawsuit. Gan replied, "The defendants defrauded me of 1,350 yuan. Initially, a friend, Cao Mingqi, introduced me to the two defendants, Xiong and Hu, who said I could get a job at the Intelligence Bureau. They asked me to pay a deposit of 1,500 yuan and appointed me as the team leader of the Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi five-county district. I paid a total of 1,380 yuan in three installments. On September 15th, I finally received an appointment letter from Li Weiqing. On September 22nd, I went to Nantong to set up an office. Unexpectedly, less than three days later, on September 25th, the defendant Li Weiqing suddenly published a notice in the Minbao newspaper stating that the Intelligence Bureau had been ordered to close and await reorganization. After seeing the news in Nantong on the 26th, I rushed to Shanghai that evening to negotiate with the defendants. Li claimed that the word 'close' only referred to the Shanghai part and had nothing to do with Nantong. At the same time, Xiong handed me an order and instructed me to intensify my work." The judge asked Li Weiqing when the Intelligence Bureau was established. Li replied, "Around August of last year." The judge asked, "When did it close?" Li replied, "September 25th." The judge asked, "At that time, did you receive an order from the Ministry of Finance to close or reorganize?" Li replied, "I did not receive an order; I requested the closure myself." The judge asked, "Since you requested it yourself, you must have received an approval document." Li replied, "I don't have an approval document." The judge asked, "Without an order or an approval document, you acted on your own initiative? You are employed in a formal government agency, why are you so confused?" The judge ordered Li to provide a reliable guarantor who could be summoned at any time and instructed him to submit all closing orders and opening orders from the Ministry of Finance to the court for verification at the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Truck Collision Causes Disaster; Three Fishmongers Killed and Four Injured</h3>
<p>Two Trucks Collide at a Turn, Seven Fishmongers Bear the Brunt</p>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday, a No. 1692 licensed truck from Fuju Truck Company, No. 249 Jielu Road, Yangshupu Dinghai Island Fish Market, loaded with dozens of baskets of fresh fish and thirteen fishmongers, was driven by Zhang Genfu from Jiading, heading south on Yangshupu Road. At the same time, a truck with license No. 6499 from Su Hengmao Truck Company was also returning along the same road. As they approached the intersection of Songpan Road and Guangxin Road, the driver of the Su Hengmao truck, Wu Shaoyuan from Nanjing, became impatient and overtook the truck. However, as he reached the corner, he could not stop in time to avoid a collision. The two trucks collided at the turn. Due to the weight of the load, the Fuju truck did not suffer extensive damage, but the railing was broken. Among the thirteen fishmongers on the truck, seven who were at the front bore the brunt of the impact, suffering severe injuries and fatalities. After being informed, the nearby police officers immediately notified the police station to dispatch ambulances to transport the injured to the hospital for treatment. However, Xu Ayu, a 50-year-old from Ningbo, Wu Rongjin, a 17-year-old from Jiangyin, and Ka Laoan, a 52-year-old from Jiangyin, died from their critical injuries. Their bodies have been sent to the coroner's office for examination. Kong Qingyuan, a 46-year-old from Ningbo, was also seriously injured and is currently hospitalized. The other three, Qiu Genfa, 32, Chen Anqing, 11, both from Ningbo, and Dai Chongqing, 22, from Suzhou, sustained minor injuries and are not in serious condition. The driver responsible for the accident has been taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Three Die After Eating Turtle</h3>
<p>Zhao Xingsheng, 63, a coolie from Pudong, Xu Atian, 35, and a small tailor (unidentified, around 40 years old) who lived at No. 72, Li Mei Road, French Concession, made their living by scavenging and rummaging through trash cans. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, at around 5:00 PM, the three of them went to the Yiheguan small restaurant at No. 136, Huageo Road, for dinner and ate cooked turtle, which led to poisoning. The small tailor died from the poisoning at his residence on the afternoon of the 21st, at around 4:00 PM. His death was reported to the French police by his landlady, Wu Zhu, who had the body transported to the Tongren Fuyuan sub-hall for an autopsy. On the morning of the 22nd, at around 10:00 AM, Zhao and Xu, at their residence, also suffered severe abdominal pain due to the poisoning. They were sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital across from the Great World for treatment, but the treatment was ineffective. The two died successively at 1:40 PM that afternoon. The hospital reported the deaths to the French police, who had the bodies sent to the coroner's office and summoned Yao Jingzhi, the owner of the Yiheguan restaurant, for questioning. The matter has been reported to the Second Special District Court for officials to inspect the bodies today. It is also reported that the deceased were addicted to morphine, and it is suspected that the turtle reacted with the drugs, causing the deaths.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Addresses the Issue of Maids</h3>
<p>May Adopt a Registration System</p>
<p>In 1930, a Public Works Department police lawyer submitted a report detailing the Chinese custom of keeping maids and its origin. It also covered sections related to the practice of keeping maids within Chinese Criminal Law (crime against freedom). The Public Works Department has been paying close attention to this issue recently. The first planned step is to assign Miss M. Hinder, head of the Public Works Department Factory Affairs Office, to find ways to protect maids. Miss Hinder is a well-studied expert in factory issues and is familiar with apprentice and child labor conditions. She will attempt to ensure that needy maids receive protection and will collect relevant messages and data for the Public Works Department, allowing it to determine the appropriate steps to take, such as implementing registration or other methods. If violations of freedom are discovered, the Public Works Department may prosecute the case under Section 196 of Chinese Criminal Law.</p>

<h3>Female Workers at the Public Welfare Factory Expected to Return to Work Today</h3>
<p>Party and Government Mediation Agree on a Solution</p>
<p>At the British-owned Public Welfare Cotton Mill, No. 150 Route de Loubert, the workers in the coarse and fine yarn sections went on strike in protest of the dismissal of the workers in the bobbin section by the enemy. The party and government agencies dispatched personnel to mediate, and a resolution has been reached regarding the dismissal of male workers and water supply. However, on the female worker side, the factory hiring of a new foreman, Qin Defang, has raised fears of replacing the original foreman, so only a little over one hundred people returned to the factory yesterday. Most workers continued to strike. After receiving the report, the party and government agencies dispatched Li Weixiong from the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Committee, Yu Yueqiu from the Investigation Section, Zhang Chuqiang from the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Xuefan from the Federation of Trade Unions, and Yao Guangchuan, the head of the Ximen Branch of the Police Bureau, to the factory yesterday afternoon to mediate. The opinions of both parties were very close, and a solution has been drafted. The solution was immediately relayed to the factory management and they were urged to resume work. The factory management also agreed to the solution, so workers are expected to return to work as usual today.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Mediates the Hengfeng Silk Factory Dispute Yesterday</h3>
<p>First, Let Both Parties Consult on Their Own</p>
<p>After the workers of the Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory at No. 23 Haizhou Road went on strike due to the failure to meet their eight demands regarding treatment, the workers have resumed work after being persuaded by the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau convened a mediation session at 1:00 PM yesterday. The management representative, Tong Chuanqing, and the labor representative, He Yao, attended. The session was chaired by mediator Zhang Chuqiang, with Jiang Shifu recording. First, the chairman presented the eight demands for discussion one by one. The labor and management parties each stated their opinions. Finally, it was decided that the labor and management parties should first negotiate a solution on their own. If there is no result, the government will mediate according to law.</p>
<h3>Cai Yuanxing Sues Wang Yunfu and Others for Returning Estate Under Guardianship</h3>
<p>The Result of the Trial is that the Defendants are Not Guilty</p>
<p>When Cai Qin Fu, a shareholder of Ruilong Company in Ningbo, died of illness, his son Yuanxing was still a young child, and his wife was ignorant. Therefore, his estate was entrusted to his sworn brother Wang Yunfu from Zhejiang, who resides at No. 19, Lane 660, Seymour Road, for safekeeping. Not long after, Cai's wife, Wang, also died. Yuanxing became an orphan. Now that he has come of age, he has begun investigating the amount of the estate. After investigation, the amount that is under Wang's custody and can be verified is twelve shares of China Bank stock, each with a value of 100 yuan, and 1,174 yuan deposited in the bank. Last month, Yuanxing asked Wang for the estate. Wang said that Yuanxing was young and needed a certificate from a senior member of the Cai family before he would hand it over. Yuanxing then asked his uncle Cai Tongqiu and his maternal uncle Wang Mingsan to send a letter to Wang in their joint names to serve as proof. However, after receiving the letter, Wang requested that Yuanxing invite Cai and Wang to come to the venue for handover. However, Cai and Wang never went with him, resulting in an indefinite postponement. Yuanxing therefore determined that the three had the intention of jointly misappropriating the estate under guardianship. He hired lawyer Tao Wuzhi to file a criminal lawsuit of breach of trust and embezzlement against Wang, Cai, and Wang in the First Special District Court, and also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that the court order them to return the estate under guardianship. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the court to summon the plaintiff and defendants for interrogation. First, the plaintiff Cai Yuanxing explained the process. When questioned, Wang Yunfu admitted the facts but said that he would hand over the estate if the plaintiff could come with Cai and Wang. However, the two defendants, Cai and Wang, said that the estate was designated for a specific purpose by the deceased at the time of his death, and they were afraid that the plaintiff would use it for other purposes, so they were unwilling to go with him. After a debate by the lawyers on both sides, the court immediately announced the verdict: the defendants are not guilty, and the attached civil lawsuit is dismissed.</p>
<h3>Water Levels Rise; Yangtze River Night Navigation Ban Lifted</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Hankou Water Levels Return to Normal; Sunken Lao Shu Tong Wheel Does Not Affect Navigation</p>
<p>Due to scarce rainfall last year, the Yangtze River water level receded rapidly, causing the low-water season to arrive especially early, making navigation difficult. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the entire Yangtze River line is now clear and has returned to its normal water level. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yangtze River Gradually Returns to Normal Water Level</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Customs yesterday, the draft of the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River in the lower reaches is at least 17 feet and 8 inches, so large Yangtze River vessels can operate as usual. The water levels along the way yesterday are listed below: Hankou 7 feet 8 inches, Jiujiang 9 feet 3 inches, Anqing 8 feet 8 inches, Wuhu 6 feet 3 inches, Zhenjiang 6 feet 9 inches. It is now the spring flood season, so the river water is expected to increase further.</p>
<p>Sunken Shu Tong Wheel Does Not Obstruct Waterway</p>
<p>Yichang in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River also has a water level of 1 foot and 2 inches yesterday, and shallow water vessels can also travel smoothly. However, the Shu Tong Company's tugboat, which sank near Xintan upstream of Yichang, obstructed the waterway. The Jianghai Customs has received a telegram from the Yichang Customs Commissioner stating that Jiang vessels can pass safely through the sunken ship area. The telegram states that after the Shu Tong tugboat sank at Xintan on January 18th, the Minzhi vessel passed safely through the area. Merchants are instructed to be careful when traveling near the sunken ship.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Navigation in the Upstream Chai Pan Channel</p>
<p>In the Chai Panzi Channel in the Chongqing section of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Dalaiyu vessel sank in 1926. The sunken ship has not been removed or destroyed. The Jianghai Customs recently received a notice from the Jiang Wu Director of the Chongqing Customs that the sunken ship was 2 feet above the water surface. Due to accumulated sand and the receding water depth, the sunken ship is now 2 feet above the water surface. Upstream vessels should pay close attention.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hankou Night Navigation Ban Lifted at Any Time</p>
<p>Due to the especially low-water season, the customs office has banned night navigation for upstream and downstream vessels at the Huoyanshan Honggaopo waterway under the jurisdiction of the Jiujiang Customs in the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River. Due to the daily rise in river water, night navigation is now permitted for upstream vessels, while downstream vessels are still restricted to daytime navigation. The bans on other waterways will be lifted at any time depending on the river water situation.</p>

<h3>Sun Shaoqing Arrested for Controlling Lawsuits</h3>
<p>First Accused by Others, Then Prosecuted by the Police Department</p>
<p>Sun Claims That His Cousin Extorted Money and Made False Accusations</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing, a 46-year-old from Tongzhou, resides at No. 28, Huayan Lane, No. 56, Zhangjia Garden, Route des Soeurs. He used to be a detective in the Shanghai Municipal Police Department. After leaving the police force, he worked as a contractor at the Waibaidu Bridge wharf. Recently, Jiang Zhaozhou (also known as Jiang Shu), a native of Anhui who resides at No. 4, Hongxi Lane, Avenue Haig, filed a lawsuit against Sun in the First Special District Court of Shanghai, accusing Sun of controlling lawsuits.</p>
<p>Fraud and Breach of Trust: The facts are that Jiang and Sun jointly established the Shuguang Law Firm at No. 8, Lane 60, Weihaiwei Road, to handle litigation. The cases handled included Sun Wu's lawsuit against Wu Dengyun for division of property and Jiang Guopei's lawsuit against Jiang Yang for division of property. Both cases were resolved through mediation, resulting in a large amount of money. However, Sun only gave Jiang a small amount of money, and Sun embezzled the rest. Therefore, Jiang filed a lawsuit requesting that Sun be punished according to Articles 157, Section 2, 154, Section 1, and 340 of the Criminal Law. Because this type of case cannot be privately prosecuted, the Public Works Department Legal Department learned of the case and instructed the Chief Inspector's Office of the Patrol Department to investigate. Under the investigation of Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui, it was determined that Jiang and Sun were acting together. Therefore, they requested that the First Special Court issue Arrest Warrant No. 1295 against Jiang and Sun and issued a search warrant to search No. 8, Lane 60, Weihaiwei Road. Lu and Liu arrested Sun the day before yesterday and found that Jiang was not in Shanghai, so they did not arrest him. When they went to Weihaiwei Road, they found that Lane 60 had been rebuilt, so they could not carry out the search. Yesterday morning, Sun was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District, where Judge Qian Hongye presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and said that a litigation paper of Ma Hongkui was found in Sun's house. Because the case requires investigation, he requested a postponement. After the West Detective Inspector reported the arrest, he questioned Sun Shaoqing. Sun said that he knew Jiang Zhaozhou well and that they had recently partnered to open the Dahua Brewery. There was no such thing as jointly establishing the Shuguang Law Firm. The cause of this case was not that Jiang wanted to sue Sun, but that Sun's cousin Fang Nianxuan falsely accused him. Because Fang had previously been poor and lived in Sun's house, he was driven out for immoral behavior. Fang then organized gangs to threaten Sun, initially asking for 5,000 yuan, and then increasing the amount to 100,000 yuan. Because Sun did not agree and reported the case to the Chengdu Road Police Station, Fang made false accusations. Judge Qian reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be postponed to next Tuesday morning for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai South Exchange Industry Held a Representative Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Established Small Groups to Seek Self-Rectification</p>
<p>Investigated Capital and Re-Filed Reports</p>
<p>The Shanghai Exchange Industry Association Shanghai South Office, in order to relieve members, maintain business, prepare to report income tax methods, and exchange one-cent new copper auxiliary coins, convened a representative meeting at 12:00 noon yesterday. More than 30 people attended, chaired by Chen Zhongxian. Discussed items: (1) Yang Keqin proposed that the market has been declining recently, and the industry has not sought relief, but has been sacrificing itself with price cuts. At the end of the lunar year, exchange market prices were extremely chaotic, which outsiders considered manipulative. However, as a result, many businesses closed. If the association does not urgently seek relief measures, the future of the industry is of deep concern. He suggested that each road actively prepare a small group, with ten households as a group, and elect one person from each group to be responsible for guiding members to abide by commercial ethics and industry regulations, and to maintain business development and the industry's reputation. The meeting decided to convene a scheduled meeting to decide on the method, which will be organized by the Executive Committee. (2) Zhang Songji reported that members have been coming to the office to inquire about the income tax laws and regulations. It is unknown to them. The reporting deadline is approaching. If the association does not prepare for it, members will be affected in the future, and it will be difficult to shirk responsibility. He should follow the matter previously reported to the Association, but has not received a response. The meeting decided to send collectors Mei Dingxuan and Yang Xiazheng to first verify the member capital and report to the Association for filing. The tax law details and bookkeeping procedures will be notified to members after the Association verifies them, so as to avoid complicated procedures. (3) Ye Yasheng proposed that the Central Bank has entrusted the Association to entrust the allied industry to exchange new copper auxiliary coins, designating 100 companies per day, totaling 10,000 yuan, with 1,000 yuan to be distributed to the South City and French Concession offices. It is difficult to distribute equally among the households, and the allied industry has not completely received it. There is also a transfer. Now the two districts of South City and the French Concession are not enough to allocate. The Association should change its methods to make the exchange more widespread and avoid misunderstandings and disputes among members. There is no problem if there is no manipulation in the exchange of old copper coins for new coins. The meeting decided to retain the current method, and discuss it again when the market turns around. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Abortion Leading to Death: Female Doctor Sentenced</h3>
<p>Dáshēng Hospital Director Yán Pǐnzhēng Imprisoned for Three Years and Two Months</p>
<p>Nurse Gù Shǎoqín Also Sentenced to Ten Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lǐ Jìngzhēn, a 25-year-old woman from Shanghai and the stepmother of Lǐ Wénguì, a Shàoxīng native who has been doing business in Tiānjīn and resides at No. 97, Yǒngyù Lane, Bèilè Road, French Concession, had an affair with Shěn Fúshēng, resulting in a four-month pregnancy. Fearing the shame of childbirth, she decided to have an abortion. On the 4th of this month at 8 PM, introduced by her friend Xuē Kèbīn, she entered Dáshēng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 200, Sàbō Sài Road. There, Yán Pǐnzhēng, the hospital director and chief physician, a woman from Chóngmíng, along with intern nurse Gù Shǎoqín and Xuē Kèbīn, performed the abortion. Due to surgical incompetence, her uterus and birth canal were injured, causing unstoppable bleeding, leading to her death the following morning. The deceased's maid, Chǔ Zhāngshì, reported it to the French police, who detained Yán Pǐnzhēng, Gù Shǎoqín, and Xuē Kèbīn, seizing the abortion instruments. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. After confirmation by the Special No. 2 Court, Yán, Gù, and Xuē were handed over to the court. The police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution according to the law. The victim's husband, Lǐ Wénguì, also hired a lawyer to file a supplementary private lawsuit, seeking compensation for losses and the recovery of a diamond ring worth 12,035 yuan that had been swallowed by the hospital. After questioning by Judge Chén Shuòyīng, the defendants each hired lawyers to defend themselves. The announcement of the conclusion of the debate and the awaiting of sentencing had been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning, the sentencing was announced. Judge Chén arrived at the First Criminal Court and sentenced Yán Pǐnzhēng to three years and two months imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan for intentionally profiting from abortion leading to death. Gù Shǎoqín was sentenced to ten months imprisonment for assisting in the abortion. Xuē Kèbīn was sentenced to one year and eight months imprisonment for inciting the abortion. The supplementary civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial. During the appeal period, the defendants were transferred to the detention center. The defendants' defense lawyers requested bail for the defendants during the appeal period, but the court refused. The police then took the three defendants back into custody.</p>
<h3>Pawnbroking Industry: New and Old Colleagues Hold Annual Membership Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Discussing Deposit Earnings</p>
<p>The Pawnbroking Trade Association of this city, due to the pawnbroking businesses of its new and old members in the Chinese Concession, at the beginning of their establishment, when there were no banks or money houses in Shanghai, most surplus funds were deposited in pawnshops, making them financial institutions that activated the market. Later, with social evolution, banks and money houses were gradually established, and most deposits were transferred to banks and money houses. As of now, the surplus deposits in pawnshops are very small. Now, the Ministry of Finance authorities, because the deadline for tax declaration for various industries is approaching, instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to distribute notices, instructing compliance. After receiving the income tax declaration order, the association convened a full executive committee meeting to actively discuss and study various important issues. However, because this matter is significant and greatly affects the business of the industry, it is specifically scheduled for noon today, at the association's premises in Wújiā Lane, Nánshì, to hold an annual meeting of all new and old members. In addition to reporting on the association's affairs and accounts for the past year, they will also discuss the handling of income tax withholding on deposits in pawnshops, as well as how to declare the income tax on the pawnshops' own profits. A year-end banquet will be held afterwards for networking.</p>
<h3>Jealousy Among Dance Halls: A Shanghai Dance Hall Robbery</h3>
<p>Dance Hostesses Transfer from the Juélù to Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhū Xiánshēng Leads a Crowd to Make Trouble</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dance Hall at No. 10, Lane 440, Fújiàn Road, Guǎngdōng Road intersection, just opened last Lunar New Year's Eve. Tāng Yīyǎ is the manager, and Lù Xīfēng is the assistant manager. The business is quite prosperous. Unexpectedly, last Saturday night around 9 PM, a fight broke out in the hall. The music stand, teapots, teacups, and tables and chairs were mostly destroyed, with losses estimated at over one hundred yuan. Later, the police investigation revealed the cause of the incident. Two dance hostesses, Xià Wéiyīng and Zhào Yànyàn, originally danced at the Juélù Dance Hall on Yúqiàqīng Road. However, since the opening of the Shanghai Dance Hall, these two dance hostesses transferred to Shanghai and have been doing well. Therefore, it caused jealousy from the Juélù Dance Hall. Around 9 PM on the 20th of this month, Zhū Xiánshēng, the owner of the Juélù Dance Hall, led the hall's bodyguards, Mǐn Xīnyáng from Tiānjīn, Fáng Sōngtāo, inspectors Zhāng Lìlún and Wáng Tíngshēng, and more than twenty others to make trouble at the Shanghai Dance Hall. They first occupied several tables, then bought dance tickets, forcibly wanting Xià and Zhào to go out with them. However, at that time, dance hostesses Xià and Zhào happened to have dance guests Lǐ Yùlín and Wáng Chāo invite them to sit at their table. According to dance hall regulations, when a dance hostess has a guest sitting at her table, other guests cannot buy tickets to take her out. Therefore, the Shanghai Dance Hall manager refused. Unexpectedly, this angered the group, who started clamoring. They first smashed the tabletop with teacups, then threw chairs at the music stand, damaging the instruments. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the group dispersed. Manager Tāng reported it to the Lǎozhá Police Station, who dispatched Western Inspector Smith, Chinese Detective Wáng Shànqīng, and Hé Rénruì to investigate at Juélù. When bodyguard Mǐn Xīnyáng saw the detectives arrive, he fled north out the door and was caught after being chased. A nine-section steel whip was found on him. They then entered the dance hall and arrested inspector Zhāng Lìlún. The other three perpetrators, Zhū Xiánshēng and others, had escaped. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiǎng Bǎolián filed charges according to Article 150 of the Criminal Law for disrupting order and Article 354 for property damage, and presented the above situation, requesting a postponement because the main perpetrator was at large. He also stated that dance guests Lǐ Yùlín and Wáng Chāo were also injured and had sought treatment at the Rénjì Hospital afterward. Furthermore, according to the complaint filed by Tāng Yīyǎ, the manager of the Shanghai Dance Hall, and the supplementary civil lawsuit, when questioned, the two defendants, Mǐn and Zhāng, gave evasive testimonies and also hired lawyers to appear in court, requesting bail. Judge Dài ordered the two defendants to be detained and a new hearing scheduled for Wednesday morning this week.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shallow-Water Post Office Maintains Sìchuān-Guìzhōu Postal Service</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 139: Received an order from the Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Communications stating that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have low water levels, and ships are scarce, making it extremely difficult to transport mail and parcels to and from Sìchuān and Guìzhōu provinces. In order to maintain postal services during the shallow water period, the Húnán Administration has organized the Xiāng-Guì Automobile Route to reroute light mail and parcels to and from various provinces and Guìzhōu province, as well as Guìzhōu parcels, registered items, printed matter, etc., that were previously transited through Sìchuān, via Chángshā. Mail to and from Sìchuān province will still be temporarily transported by ship. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge. Director Zhà Pèilín, February 20.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Stamps Can Be Exchanged Until the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1391: Received a notice from the Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Communications stating that the sale of the commemorative stamps for the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the postal service was originally scheduled to cease on April 1, 1937. Within three months after the cessation of sales (i.e., from April 1, 1937, to June 30, 1937), they could still be used to pay for postage. From July 1, 1937, they would be invalidated and not allowed for use. However, the public holding these stamps would still be allowed to exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices within three months after the invalidation (i.e., from July 1, 1937, to September 30, 1937). This has already been ordered to be announced. Now, because the Postal Law has been implemented, according to the provisions of the law, the exchange period after invalidation should be limited to six months, i.e., from July 1, 1937, to December 31, 1937. No further exchanges will be allowed after the deadline. This is hereby announced for public knowledge. Director Zhà Pèilín, February 17.</p>
<h3>Dàjiābà in Jiāng Area: China Merchants' Dàshùnkāng Aground</h3>
<p>Jiānghuá Has Been Dispatched for Rescue</p>
<p>Jiāng Water Has Been Rising Continuously for Days</p>
<p>Shallow Water Fees to Be Reduced Again</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level has risen sharply, and the entire route is open for smooth navigation. Jiāng steamers with larger drafts can now sail to Hànkǒu. The shallow water fees previously added by the six companies have already been reduced by 10%. Today, further discussions will be held to reduce them by another 20%, leaving only 20% to be collected. On the Chángshā route, the fees have already been reduced by 50%. Now it is planned to reduce them by another 20%, leaving 30% to be collected. Because the river water has risen significantly, various companies have dispatched ocean-going ships to transport large quantities of rice from Jiǔjiāng to Guǎngdōng. The state-run China Merchants Bureau's Dàshùnkāng steamer sailed to Jiǔjiāng this time and loaded a full ship of rice from Gàn Province for transport to Guǎngdōng. Yesterday morning, the ship reached Dàjiābà, about 13 nautical miles below Tàizǐjī and above Dàtōng. At that location, the deepest draft of the river surface was 17 feet, while the Dàshùnkāng, fully loaded with rice, had a draft of 18 feet and 4 inches. Also, because there was heavy fog on the river surface, it ran aground. The hull was deeply embedded in the shallow beach and could not be moved. The shipowner immediately sent a telegram requesting rescue. The Shanghai Bureau received the telegram and, as there were no ships available for dispatch from Shanghai at that time, decided to send a telegram to the Jiānghuá steamer, which was coming from Hàn to Shanghai, to quickly go to Dàjiābà and find a way to rescue the Dàshùnkāng. If they can tow the Dàshùnkāng out during the rising water, that would be best. If they still cannot tow it, they will hire barges and the No. 1 tugboat to unload the cargo and then tow it away.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fújiàn Freight Rates Increase by 20%</h3>
<p>Effective from Next Month 1st</p>
<p>Last year, shipping on the northern and southern ocean routes and the Yangtze River routes was very developed, and the water freight rates at coastal ports and on the Yangtze River have repeatedly increased. Only the Shanghai-Fúzhōu route has remained at the old price. When the freight rates on various routes increased last year, this route had not increased. Recently, due to the fact that the cost of metal, coal, materials, and other items used for ships has been extremely high, some being more than double the previous cost, the China Merchants, Three Northern, Tàigǔ, and Rìqīng shipping companies held a joint meeting yesterday and decided that, starting from the 1st of next month, the cargo shipped from Shanghai to Fúzhōu will uniformly increase by 20% of the original freight rate. This will be announced to the customers today.</p>

<h3>Cǎěrdūn to Present the Bǎikèmén All-Star Gala the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The long-awaited Bǎikèmén All-Star Gala, renowned for its eighty performers and forty beauties, has stirred the local people with its great fame, who have been eagerly anticipating it. It is now scheduled to debut at the Cǎěrdūn Theatre starting the day after tomorrow (the 25th of this month). The theatre is strict in its selection of song and dance troupes. Years ago, when the Wànhuā Troupe came to Shanghai, it performed at the theatre and caused a sensation, with crowds of people thronging the streets. It is said that the reputation of the Bǎikèmén All-Star Gala in Europe and the United States is no less than that of the past Wànhuā Troupe. In the past, when the Hǎijīng Bómǎ Circus came to Shanghai, a few members of the troupe participated and were highly skilled, achieving surprising success. The ladies of Shanghai were amazed. Now the entire troupe is coming to Shanghai for the first time, appearing before the people of Shanghai in a completely new form. It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Unity and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pān Gōngzhǎn</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will ask again: seeking peace through unity is correct, but to achieve unity, it is necessary to eliminate separatist forces. If separatist forces are unwilling to be eliminated, war is inevitable. If the initial goal is unity for peace, and the subsequent action is war for unity, isn't this a contradiction? Therefore, I will further explain the relationship between unity and war.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that unity requires the elimination of separatist forces. What methods should be used to eliminate them? It should be understood that war is not always necessary, nor is it always unnecessary. When war is needed, then war; when war is not needed, then peace. Therefore, seeking peace requires unity, and this is certain. However, seeking unity does not necessarily mean relying solely on peace or solely on war. The first "peace" is the goal, and the second "peace" is the method. In other words, we can use peaceful methods to eliminate separatist forces, achieve unity, and reach the goal of peace; we can also use war to eliminate separatist forces, achieve unity, and reach the goal of peace.</p>
<p>There are many examples in Chinese and foreign history of using war to eliminate separatist forces. There are countless examples. As for examples of eliminating separatist forces through peaceful means, there are also some. After Emperor Tàizǔ of Sòng, Zhào Kuàngyìn, became emperor, he saw that the meritorious military generals inevitably became arrogant, and he was deeply afraid that they would become too powerful to control, forming a separatist situation. Therefore, he hosted a banquet for the meritorious officials and persuaded them to hand over their military power. This is a famous story in history called "Releasing Military Power with a Cup of Wine." That is an example of using peaceful means to eliminate separatist forces. As for how the warlord separatist forces gradually disappeared after the establishment of the Republic of China? I can say that the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926 was to suppress what? It was to suppress the warlords. First, Wu Peifu; second, Sun Chuanfang; third, Zhang Zuolin. If the Northern Expedition had not been launched at that time, how would these warlord separatist forces have been eliminated? Therefore, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was to seek unity through war and to seek peace through unity. This kind of use of war to seek unity is sometimes necessary, but it is not necessarily the only method. Mencius once said, "King Wen's one anger pacified the people of the world, ...King Wu's one anger also pacified the people of the world." He also said, "Tang's one campaign, starting with Ge, the world believed in him. Invading the western barbarians while facing the east, the eastern people complained; invading the northern barbarians while facing the south, the southern people complained." Even saints like Tang and Wu could not avoid using war to unify China. Needless to say, how much war was used to create a unified situation in the dynasties after Qin Shi Huang. Yet now, a few biased people call seeking unity through war "military unification," as if it were absolutely evil, forgetting history and ignoring reality. In all fairness, if the Northern Expedition had not been launched in 1926, how could the warlord separatist forces have been eliminated? Therefore, when it is necessary, and when all peaceful methods have failed to achieve unity, one must use force to quell rebellion, punish traitors, and punish those who undermine unity; otherwise, what is the use of military force? There are only two ways to achieve unity, past and present, at home and abroad: peace and war. Use peace when you should use peace; use war when you should use war. Mencius, who always advocated "subduing people with virtue," even said to King Xuan of Qi, "Now if the king is angry, the people of the world will only fear that the king does not like bravery." He also said, "Now Yan abuses its people, and if the king goes to conquer it, the people will think that he is rescuing them from fire and water, and they will bring baskets of food and pots of drink to welcome the king's army." It can be seen that war is not necessarily something that should only be cursed.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Indian Merchants Prepare to Receive Goods</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Rise by 2.5 Yuan This Month</p>
<p>Sellers Vigorously Deliver Goods</p>
<p>Yarn in Warehouses Exceeds 30,000 Bales</p>
<p>Large Volume of Forward Contracts Sold Off</p>
<p>The downward trend in forward yarn contracts is becoming increasingly intense, and the situation is weak. This is due to the abundance of delivery commodities causing prices to fall. However, the February contract is the final act, and many parties are prepared to receive all deliveries, so the February contract alone rose by 2.5 yuan. However, prices for later months have greatly loosened. According to market sources, the goods received by buyers are being heavily sold off in the forward market to avoid risks. Afternoon reports indicate that deliveries to warehouses have exceeded 30,000 bales, reaching 33,000 bales. Among these, 1,750 bales have already been withdrawn from delivery because the closing price was one yuan lower. Therefore, although this month is being kept tight, sellers are very active in the forward market, and the market is tending to fall. However, spot yarn sales have not declined. The closing price of standard yarn for the February contract was 257 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan compared to last month, it is said.</p>
<p>Significant Price Fluctuations Between Spot and Forward Standard Yarn</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the current month was the last day of trading, and the competition between buyers and sellers became more intense. Although sellers vigorously delivered goods, Indian merchants were prepared to accept a large volume, so the price for this month still rose by 2 yuan. However, the atmosphere for later months was peaceful. At the second trading session, the price for this month rose another yuan, while the price for later months declined instead. Most traders were neutral, because the yarn delivered to warehouses was already close to 30,000 bales, so they were unanimously selling off the forward contracts, putting heavy pressure on the market. However, spot yarn trading was still good, and Osaka's Three Products Yarn also rebounded 2.7 to 3.2 yuan. The final prices of standard yarn for each month fell by 0.9 to 1.34 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, but the price for this month rose by 2.5 yuan. The market transactions were very active, and trading closed at around 12:30 PM. At the afternoon opening, the market situation for this month was still high, rising another 0.5 yuan, but many buyers sold off their forward contracts, causing the price to fall. After the second session, the price for this month fell 0.5 yuan, and the price for later months gradually declined. The yarn delivered to warehouses had reached over 32,000 bales. Compared with the morning closing price, the result for standard yarn was that the February contract remained unchanged, while the price for later months fell another 0.8 to 1.5 yuan. Sales included Dafu (2,500 bales), Tongji (2,300 bales), Jinchang (2,900 bales), Gengfeng (1,250 bales), Dachangcheng (1,000 bales), Changfeng (1,900 bales), Fukang (2,100 bales), Mingde (2,850 bales), Yuan Yi (1,200 bales), Run Kang (2,850 bales), and Xincheng (800 bales). Purchases included Hexing (1,300 bales), Dafeng (1,350 bales), Juxing (900 bales), Yuda (1,700 bales), Zhenda (1,550 bales), Daqing (1,050 bales), Changyu (1,200 bales), Renfeng (1,400 bales), Chunchang (1,600 bales), Senkang (3,000 bales), Juncheng (1,050 bales), Shengyuan (1,000 bales), Hengde (900 bales), Jifeng (800 bales), and Shenji (900 bales). The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Exceed 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. A statistical check of all the groups buying throughout the day totals 2,193 bales. The selling price is similar to the previous day. The purchase amount of each group is listed below.</p>
<p>Large Batch of New Contracts Delivered</p>
<p>Many Cotton Futures Positions Liquidated</p>
<p>Month-End Price Falls to 42.6 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market is weakening, and the downward trend is particularly strong. This is due to the decline in the yarn market, the sluggish overseas cotton market, and the fact that there are still 45,000 dan of new contracts for delivery this month. After inspection, they are up to standard, and the factories have no need to receive goods, so people are particularly frustrated. The market continues to decline, and the price for this month breaks through the 3 yuan mark. The end-of-month price is 42.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Each Month Falls by More Than Half a Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, prices for each month declined generally, and the market trend was exceptionally weak. Because the delivery volume for the current month is abundant, and the new contracts of cotton that have passed the inspection at the cotton inspection office have reached 45,000 dan, sellers are increasingly active. As a result, the final prices of standard cotton for each month fell by 0.3 to 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, the market situation remained unfavorable, and there were many floating positions being liquidated in the market. With an oversupply of contracts, the downward trend for later months was particularly intense. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included Yuda (9,000 dan), Tongfu (1,800 dan), Jifeng (2,300 dan), Hengyi (6,900 dan), Zhenda (2,400 dan), Fengchun (2,400 dan), Wang Taixing (3,500 dan), Yuan Yi (5,000 dan), Fukang (5,000 dan), Jinghua (2,300 dan), Yongda (3,300 dan), Xincheng (3,800 dan), Changhe (4,200 dan), Yuanxingchang (1,700 dan), and Senkang (1,800 dan). Purchases included Dafu (1,300 dan), Tongji (4,400 dan), Juxing (2,500 dan), Dafeng (6,200 dan), Taixing (4,100 dan), Shenchang (2,800 dan), Run Kang (6,900 dan), Shengyuan (5,700 dan), Tonghe (5,800 dan), Yichang (2,800 dan), and Daji (2,000 dan). The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption is Mediocre</p>
<p>Factories have poor demand, and there are no new sources reported.</p>
<p>Small Increase in Prices for Three Products Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 22nd: Spot yarn prices rise and fall by 4 to 8 yuan. 16-count "Fan" yarn is 232 yuan, up 4 yuan. 20-count "Goldfish" yarn is 253 yuan, up 5 yuan. 40-count "Five Stars" yarn is 390 yuan, down 5 yuan. 42-count "Pheasant" yarn is 378 yuan, up 8 yuan.

The near month is 73.8 yuan, and the far month is 75.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Class B Bonds Decline the Fastest</p>
<p>Long Positions Retreat After Four Small Trading Sessions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange held the last two days of futures trading for this month. The market has resumed four full trading sessions each day. Both buyers and sellers are actively settling and swapping contracts. Since Nos. 45 and 46 sold short on Class A bonds, the market atmosphere has been depressed. Long positions for this month are most concentrated in Class B bonds, due to speculation related to the lottery red tickets. Therefore, in the last day or two, long positions have been unwinding, and the decline in Class B bonds has been the fastest. The market price declined over four small sessions, creating a short squeeze. Today is the last day of trading for the February futures. Although there may still be some squeezing, there should not be any significant changes. However, abnormal situations are unavoidable. Yesterday, at the opening in the morning, Nos. 3, 16, and 11 bought in, raising the leading prices by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, while lowering the trailing prices by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Because Nos. 5, 45, and 46 were still selling, the trend changed, and the second session immediately became depressed, trending downwards consistently, mostly falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. At the afternoon opening, long positions continued to swap, with No. 6 being the most active. All bonds fell again by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan. Although retail investors absorbed some at the closing, large long positions were still unwinding. The price of Class B bonds for this month dropped sharply again by 0.45 yuan. Only the far-term Class A bonds recovered by 0.05 yuan. The overall result was a consistent downward trend, with declines ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 11,122,500 yuan. The results of the price fluctuations are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Supply Exceeds Demand, Exchange Rates Near and Far Easing</p>

The HSBC's official exchange rates and silver balancing tax rates were flat. At this time, banks were still buying and slightly balancing. Afterwards, foreign banks were selling heavily. Although Meifu closed, the situation was still loose. Fortunately, Chinese firms mediated, so the overall situation was still peaceful. Later in the market, Little Luzon sold a small amount of US dollars. The banks' appetite was depressed, and the situation remained hard. Midway, the banks slightly offset, and the market stabilized. At the close, the near-term selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling 2 pence 0.5625, and the US exchange was 29.6875 yuan.

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Spot Sales from All Routes Gradually Increase</p>
<p>Prices for Current Goods are All Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fabric market continued to be firm. This was due to the gradual increase in spot sales from all routes. At the same time, the fabric market in Qingdao was even better than in Shanghai, with selling prices exceeding Shanghai's by more than 0.1 yuan. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill from Qingdao were constantly absorbed by Tianjin merchants, and selling prices rose steadily. Yesterday, the price increased by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per bolt, and Shanghai goods also increased by 0.025 yuan. Tianjin merchants traded over 500 bales. Merchants on this street were less interested, trading nearly 200 bales. Japanese merchants opened few goods. Fine cloth and fine twill from local factories were in highest demand from Wuzhou merchants, with 500 more pieces being purchased. The appetite for goods in Guangzhou and Shantou was also strong, with 400 to 500 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, striped plain silk, serge, zigong, printed cloth, and colored cloth being traded. Merchants from Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou also showed improvement, with increased purchases. This was actually because the Nanyang market was gradually improving. In addition, spot sales in the Yangtze River basin, the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the northwest regions were also expected to develop. Therefore, although Shanghai's inventory was quite abundant, the atmosphere was still good. Prices were firm for all goods that were currently selling, and the only goods whose price fell were those that were out of season. However, the downward trend was also very moderate, it is said.</p>
<p>Zigong Serge Sells Particularly Well</p>
<p>The Trend for Domestic Goods is Even Better</p>
<p>Zigong felt is currently selling very well, and merchants on this street all have demand. Western goods are very short in stock, and although Eastern goods are in circulation, they are few in number. As a result, domestic goods are taking the opportunity to rise, and sales are very active. The products of the Zhanghua and Xiexin Second Factories are almost unable to meet demand. The trend is better than other woolen fabrics.</p>
<p>Plain serge is currently in time for spring sales. Clothing stores, cotton cloth shops, and tailoring shops all have large purchases. The trend for domestic goods is better than for Western goods. This is because in recent years, after the new uniform system was adopted, military, government, academic, and business circles have all been vigorously promoting the use of domestic goods, resulting in sales exceeding imported goods. Transactions are increasing steadily, and standard prices are particularly firm. Among them, the Zhanghua 918 and Dalong 128 brands have particularly wide sales. Yesterday, 918 yuan Tibetan plain serge sold for 3.05 yuan, and 128 sold for 3 yuan. Grass yellow and dark green were an additional 0.1 yuan.</p>

<p>Flour Prices Fall and then Stabilize Due to Poor Factory Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after opening in the morning, prices for each month showed a consistent decline. As for foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell 1.0 to 1.1 yuan, Canada fell by 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan, while Liverpool only fell slightly by 0.25. After the opening prices, because of the strong downward trend in foreign wheat, people's confidence was naturally unstable. The opening price for this month fell to 4.02 to 4.03 yuan, and the prices for March and April also fell by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. July new contracts were relatively scarce, falling only slightly by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Below the second session, factories supplemented their positions in this month, and the market stabilized. The factories' forward sales were sluggish, and outside firms slightly purchased, so the market also saw a recovery. When the afternoon market opened, the transactions for each month were relatively clear, and the market was rotating. According to speculators, if actual sales are smooth and it is difficult to get foreign wheat, then the trend is expected to be flat.</p>
<p>Inland Merchants Purchase Near- and Far-Term Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a pattern of falling first and then rising. As for foreign wheat quotations, although they fell by 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 to 1.1 yuan, the price of old wheat had not yet been agreed, and new wheat was even more difficult to agree on. Moreover, because this month has been absorbed by Tianjin merchants, the market atmosphere was relatively stable. The opening price only fell by 0.04 yuan and quickly rose by 0.04 yuan. Before March, because sellers were very few, they only fell by 0.01, 0.02, or 0.05 yuan. When the afternoon market opened, the flour market was slightly stable, and inland merchants purchased both near- and far-term wheat. Therefore, the market atmosphere was very stable, recovering by 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan. The final result was even better by 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 yuan. In the spot wheat market, because the standard price recovered and factory demand was also good, it was slightly better by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The opening price for Ocean River wheat was 6.6 yuan, the next best was 0.15 yuan less, Bengbu wheat was 6.6 yuan, Jiangbei Shaoxing Huangqiao Tiantai wheat was 6.55 yuan, and Nanjing wheat was 6.53 yuan. Fuxin handled 3,000 bags, Shenda handled 2,000 bags, and Fufeng handled 250 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Buy Machine-Hulled Rice Very Actively</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica rice and customer glutinous rice were still in high demand, especially with Guangdong merchants eagerly purchasing machine-hulled rice and late-season machine-hulled rice. In the past two days, Guangdong merchants had already purchased 50,000 bags of machine-hulled rice and machine-hulled late-season rice. In the past two days, the merchants on this street from Shantou, Xiamen, Beiyang, and Xi'an also purchased more than 20,000 bags. The market has rapidly risen, recovering by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. If Guangdong rice demand continues, the market may continue to rise in the future. Yesterday, over 40,000 bags of rice were opened, with Guangdong merchants taking two-thirds of the supply. Therefore, the sentiment was mostly excited, and although the supply from the Yangtze River was continuous, sellers still expressed intentions to raise prices, it is said.</p>
<p>Soybean Oilcake Aided by the Dalian Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean oilcake market remained flat in the morning due to the small fluctuations in the Dalian market. Only standard soybeans were affected by the sluggish spot sales and inventory accumulation, with the near-term declining slightly by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. In the afternoon, news of a sharp rise in the Dalian market suddenly arrived, and standard oil saw short covering and interest from outsiders, so the price rose steadily in each session, closing higher by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Standard oilcake also improved by 0.01 yuan. Although the rebound in Dalian's standard soybean market was strong, the current market was sluggish due to a lack of customer interest, and factories were also stagnant. The large number of tickets in Dalian had accumulated for a long time and lacked outlets, and there was talk of transporting them south. Therefore, sentiment was still weak. As a result, the near-term improved by 0.01 yuan, and the far-term improved by 0.03 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Slightly Buy and Sell Thin Rice</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was slightly more than before, with a total of 40 sources arriving, totaling about 8,100 to 8,200 shi. Thin rice accounted for more than 20 sources, but the appetite of customer merchants was still depressed. Although merchants from Tianjin and Qinhuangdao bought more than 2,000 bags of thin rice, the purchasing conditions were extremely harsh, so thin rice was still difficult to recover. Only high-quality goods barely stabilized, and mid-range goods were all discounted by a small amount. The arrival of thick japonica rice was not strong, but sales in this street were sluggish, so the market situation was still stable with a hint of softness. However, it was reported that customer premium prices suddenly rose by 0.2 yuan, and the japonica rice market inevitably had the hope of being boosted. It is expected that the market situation today may temporarily stabilize. Du Yang premium and dark mutated glutinous rice had little glory or shame.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, about 22 or 23 sources came from the river. Sales of various goods on the market were sluggish. Top-quality white glutinous rice prices were soft, and medium-grade and low-grade ones were reduced by small amounts. Thin rice stocks were abundant, and prices fell by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan. Early rice arrivals surged, and appetite was weak, with prices falling by nearly 0.1 yuan. Sheep indica was affected by sales of Jiangxi indica, and prices fell by a straight 0.1 yuan.埠Du premium was also soft by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, and the rest all had a soft trend. Only mutated yuan glutinous rice had acceptable sales, and prices recovered by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>South River Green Opens Up 0.3 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in foreign sugar was flat. Domestic green sugar was still tight. The guild's drawing price was 22.9 yuan for spot goods of 24 rough white sugar, and 7.5 yuan for re-export, with no changes. Only 8th grade spot goods of East White were down 0.05 yuan, to 22.6 yuan, while the rest maintained their original prices. The local factory's fine white sugar also had no changes. Guangdong merchants opened up over a hundred bags of Chongti Green, at 14.4 yuan, Guangzhou merchants opened up dozens of bags of Hainan foreign sugar, at 14.2 yuan, and over two hundred bags of South River Green, at 14.3 yuan, up 0.3 yuan. In addition, there were over seventy pieces of Beihai sheet green sugar at 11 yuan, and Fujian merchants opened up over a hundred bags of Zhang Diao Green at 13.6 yuan, and dozens of bags of Quanzhou sheet green sugar at 11.6 yuan, up 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint venture company held its first tender for Guangdong sugar this week. The total quota was 4,725 bags, and the bid price remained the same. The tender sold 60 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep rough white sugar at 22.8 yuan. Dongguan Factory sold another 160 bags at 22.8 yuan. Huizhou medium sand white was offered at 20 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts</h3>
<p>Medium-Grade Longan Inventory Very Short</p>
<p>Medium-grade longan has recently lacked new arrivals, and inventory is also short, so the price increase is higher. According to Quanzhou telegrams, medium-sized longan is also said to be out of stock and sellers are reluctant to sell, indicating that there is a shortage everywhere. The market is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Internal and External Silk Sales Are Still Difficult to Improve</p>
<p>Yesterday in the overseas silk market, New York was closed for the weekend, and Yokohama showed a slight increase. Spot goods were 883 yuan, up 3 yuan, futures were 848 yuan, up 9 yuan. Lyon was unchanged. In the local silk market, manufacturers' sentiment was firm, and the prices sent abroad were also high, so there were not many transactions. As for users, silk factories have generally not yet started work, and transactions were sparse. Silk market trends have been mediocre recently, and it is still difficult to expand sales of internal and external silk for a while.</p>
<p>Chinese Tea Exports Do Not Require Permits</p>
<p>In order to promote the export of domestic products, the government has completely exempted taxes on the export of red and green tea from China. However, in order to distinguish between domestic and foreign sales, permits have always been required. Last year, Cheng Zhenji, the general manager of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee, understood the details. He believed that exported red and green tea already had different boxes and baskets from domestically sold rough tea. The merchants who held these permits faced many obstacles. Therefore, he requested the upper echelons to consult the Ministry of Finance and inform the Customs Administration to abolish them. It is said that it has been officially approved. From now on, export boxed tea will save all kinds of procedures.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items</h3>
<p>Large Batches of Japanese Goods Arrive Constantly</p>
<p>Large quantities of Japanese goods continue to be imported, as repeatedly reported in the past. Statistics show that, in addition to coal, sugar, iron sheets, and iron wire, approximately 10,000 tons of goods arrive each week, which is considerable. The trade deficit with Japan can be imagined. It has been reported that the Japanese ship Maya Maru arrived this afternoon, carrying 1,000 pieces of rayon, 4,000 bags of sugar, 3,440 cans of hardened oil (for chemical use), 7,054 pieces of iron sheets, and over 3,200 tons of hydrochloric acid, sulfur, etc.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Tinplate No Longer Has Futures Contracts Available</p>
<p>Tinplate factories in the United States are not producing enough to meet distribution demands, and Japan, the South Seas Islands, and India have restricted the issuance of near-term orders. Therefore, local merchants have no futures contracts available. As a result, the situation in Shanghai is very good. Association steel is selling for 41 yuan, 90-pound double-linked American goods are selling for 46 yuan, 100-pound double-linked goods are selling for 48 yuan, 180-pound Italian tinplate is selling for 44 yuan, 180-pound French tinplate is selling for 43 yuan, and 180-pound German goods are selling for 43.5 yuan. Yesterday, 600 to 700 boxes were opened, and merchants from Tianjin purchased them. Local factories also made some minor purchases.</p>
<h3>The Woolen Fabric Industry in 1936 Passed Happily (Continued)</h3>
<p>(December) Riding breeches, broadcloth, and covert cloth all rose sharply. Black and gray colors were particularly popular. Western and Eastern goods have been exhausted, and domestic production has fallen short by one-third, resulting in a crazy rise in prices. "Sea White Dragon" was particularly popular, and almost all of the market goods have been collected, and selling prices have soared by over one yuan. Horse sleeve linings and Jiangshan horsehair sold in a timely and broad manner, but production was very short due to raw material issues, and market prices continued to soar. Polish 5-yuan bright thick overcoat wool, Yuan Chang black, white, and gray all-wool, and Western-style clothing firms need and sell rapidly, and the market goods mostly became unable to meet demand. Goods all rose by 10 percent. The trend of chic, the speed of the rise, can truly be called unprecedented and unsurpassed. Although single-sided open-water beauty does not have an actual wholesale recipient, due to weak inventory, all prices are being increased to six yuan. Since the Xi'an Incident was reported on the 13th, sellers' attitudes have suddenly hardened, and all transactions are only conducted in current national currency banknotes. Because market stocks of all goods are lacking, there is much optimism and speculation. Due to income tax reasons, the industry's year-end account closures seem more serious than in previous years, resulting in more retail transactions and fewer wholesale transactions. However, industry insiders, given the excellent market conditions, price increases, and goods shortages in 1936, are quite active in placing orders with Western and foreign firms. As a result, the year of 1936 was happily passed in a joyful atmosphere of profits. A detailed comparison of woolen fabric prices over the past year is provided below for reference.</p>

<h3>Life and Death</h3>
<p>— (Huang Weiling)</p>
<p>Is life happy? Is death painful? Many people explore this question, but they can't find the correct answer.</p>
<p>Leaving aside all theories and philosophies, the facts clearly tell us: We cannot definitively say that life is happy or painful. Similarly, we cannot definitively say that death is painful or happy.</p>
<p>However, this is merely a matter of timing. In reality, we can say this: When we are born when we shouldn't be, life is painful. Similarly, when we die when we should, death is happy; when we die when we shouldn't, death is painful.</p>
<p>If old age comes upon us, and we should die, we should die happily! If justice and responsibility compel us, and we should die, we should also happily go to our deaths! But if old age is still far away from us, we should actively seek to live, and for the sake of justice and responsibility, we should strive for a proper life.</p>
<p>A life lived when one should be alive is a happy one, and a death when one should die is also a happy one. We seek life to avoid an untimely death, and we embrace a proper death in pursuit of life.</p>
<p>Our own life and death are in our own hands!</p>
<h3>Fashionable Puppets</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>I'm ashamed to say! After drifting in Shanghai for eight or nine years, I still haven't witnessed the most fashionable electric perm. The reason is simple: my noble place is the countryside. It's really inconvenient and uneconomical to travel to Shanghai just to get a haircut. Yesterday, I went to a certain road in the French Concession on business, and my hair was already in dire need of trimming. To avoid disfiguring my appearance, I went into a barber shop with a double-wide storefront to get it fixed. It was a coincidence! There was a woman getting an electric perm! The spectacle that had been on my mind for a long time was finally revealed to me. That large perm appliance covered her head, and strands of her natural hair were strung through each of the rubber tubes inside the appliance. Once the power was turned on, the hair immediately started to spin. It amazed me! It was a horrifying sight! I wondered, how is this different from a criminal being electrocuted? If that machine broke, there would be a risk of death in an instant! It's not worth enduring such torture for the sake of fashion. No wonder some people say, "Humans may appear to be higher animals, the spirit of all things, but in reality, they are just big fools." There's a good reason for saying that!</p>
<p>Because of the perm, I couldn't help but think of other living dramas of people willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of fashion: In the harsh winter, people wear cotton robes and cotton shoes and still don't feel warm, but modern girls still wear cheongsams with thin linings and silk stockings with hollow high heels! Are they made of copper and iron and not afraid of the cold? That's all for the sake of fashion. My colleague, Mr. Mu, is good at dancing. According to him, a certain dancer reduced her food intake because lipstick made it difficult for her to eat. This proves that for the sake of fashion, people will even be cautious about eating, which is the most important thing in life.</p>
<p>Traitors seek fame and fortune and become puppets of a certain power. People in Shanghai seek fashion and are no different from puppets of fashion!</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Side Jobs</h3>
<p>— Jiao Shijie</p>
<p>Engaging in a side job in addition to one's proper occupation is nothing more than wanting to earn some extra money to supplement one's income, what is commonly called "making extra money."</p>
<p>If a woman, for example, has a proper job as a hostess, and people say that she engages in a side job, and an improper one at that, it means that she uses the name of hostess, but in reality, lives the life of a prostitute. In this case, her actual life is a reversal of the proper and the secondary, because she cannot live on her proper job, and the income from her side job is greater! So in the end, it is impossible to say which is the proper job and which is the side job.</p>
<p>Some people neglect their proper jobs for the sake of their side jobs, so ordinary businessmen cannot hold concurrent positions and cannot tolerate the existence of side jobs.</p>
<p>People with side jobs are probably always idle. People without free time have no time to engage in side jobs. Now that radio is widespread, there are many more new side jobs.</p>
<p>For a famous actor, recording records is another source of income in addition to performing on stage. Broadcasting on the radio is also another source of income. These are all side jobs. Writers can sell their writings, can go to the broadcasting station to teach, tell stories, those who can play the harmonica can also broadcast, those who can tell jokes, sing tunes, even dogs that bark and birds that sing can also broadcast. (There are such things in foreign countries.) As a result, many side job opportunities have been added. When many people succeed in their side jobs, surpassing their proper jobs, the side job becomes the proper job, and the concurrent job becomes the main job. Don't you see that many people are making a living by broadcasting?</p>
<p>Originally, only talented and ambitious people could hold concurrent positions. But now many people are doing ×× Chairman, concurrently serving as ×× President. These people with concurrent positions, rather than saying they are holding concurrent positions, it is better to directly say they are doing side jobs. In the end, the reason why they want to engage in side jobs is nothing more than wanting to earn more money!</p>

<h3>Shown to Cuier and Sent with a Handful of Willow Catkins on Lichun Day</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>This year, the stove festival was before the Great Cold,</p>
<p>By chance, we meet Lichun, the weather suddenly warms.</p>
<p>(Rising tone) My humble home, I shamefully measure the temperature,</p>
<p>The thermometer rises to sixty-five.</p>
<p>At dawn, the thrush sings,</p>
<p>The rising sun fills the courtyard trees.</p>
<p>I get up just at mao hour,</p>
<p>In a flash, it's already noon.</p>
<p>Originally, I planned with my family</p>
<p>To take the express train to Huangpu,</p>
<p>But I am troubled by frozen chilblains,</p>
<p>One foot cannot lift.</p>
<p>Although I can walk with a cane,</p>
<p>It is still painful.</p>
<p>I originally came from my hometown,</p>
<p>How could I say my return is blocked?</p>
<p>I open my pavilion by the pond,</p>
<p>Holding wine, I face the vegetable garden.</p>
<p>Pickled vegetables are being opened from the jar,</p>
<p>Zongzi are also being wrapped.</p>
<p>What a pity that my teeth are failing,</p>
<p>And not as good as your mother's.</p>
<p>Your mother is older than me,</p>
<p>Celebrating her sixtieth birthday.</p>
<p>Lichun is the beginning of the year,</p>
<p>Its system was created in ancient times.</p>
<p>Preventing old age is raising children,</p>
<p>Counting the classics, don't forget the ancestors.</p>
<p>You are one year younger,</p>
<p>Your youth is vigorous.</p>
<p>Do not learn from the old,</p>
<p>You should learn from children,</p>
<p>Laughing and talking brings spring,</p>
<p>Better than taking ginseng for supplement.</p>
<p>Crows still feed their young,</p>
<p>Lambs kneel to give milk.</p>
<p>Your brother plans to be independent,</p>
<p>To establish his own household.</p>
<p>Your younger brother is too simple,</p>
<p>Stammering and unable to speak.</p>
<p>The grandson relies on pampering,</p>
<p>Moving and kicking, using his force.</p>
<p>The weak sister cannot bear it,</p>
<p>If her skin is injured, she will complain.</p>
<p>The Queen Mother smiles,</p>
<p>Also gets angry.</p>
<p>The little maid is still foolishly cute,</p>
<p>Still lying lazily late in the day.</p>
<p>Often arguing with the cook in the kitchen,</p>
<p>Grumbling, starting disagreements.</p>
<p>I wish to be the Kitchen God,</p>
<p>Applying Xia Chu punishment to each one.</p>
<p>Reporting directly to heaven,</p>
<p>Do not tell me.</p>
<p>I am afraid of troubles,</p>
<p>Unwilling to be the head of the household.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have three burrows,</p>
<p>My zodiac sign is Rabbit.</p>
<p>Listening to it as if I didn't hear,</p>
<p>Seeing it as if I didn't see.</p>
<p>Awake, I am alone and aloof,</p>
<p>In dreams, I am always vivid.</p>
<p>Neither discussing honor or disgrace,</p>
<p>Nor caring about praise or criticism.</p>
<p>Children, do not learn from the ancients,</p>
<p>But learn from your father,</p>
<p>Everything that should be done, should be done,</p>
<p>Nothing that shouldn't be done can be forgiven.</p>
<p>Touching myself, I often smile,</p>
<p>Picking up the brush, I look around.</p>
<p>Only feeling the world is vast,</p>
<p>Do not let the good times be wasted.</p>
<p>The wind is calm, the trees are peaceful,</p>
<p>The parents rely on protection.</p>
<p>Do not look at the West Lake willows,</p>
<p>Early spring has already flown catkins.</p>
<p>Curtains rolled up, catching light gauze,</p>
<p>For no reason, blowing catkins.</p>
<p>Sent to Bu Qicha,</p>
<p>To ask for Xie Ting sentences.</p>
<p>Still fearing old eyes are blurred,</p>
<p>Or perhaps a mistake in recognition.</p>
<p>Sealed in a jade earring,</p>
<p>To make up for old age. (Attached Willow Catkins? One package)</p>
<h3>The Replaced Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Murmurs of Gratitude for a Compassionate Mother-in-law, Repenting and Sacrificing Filially, Autumn Light Dims, Delicate Eyebrows Trigger Reflections on the Scenery)</p>
<p>Menglan said, "Is she really sick? How come I can't see a trace of it?" The Second Young Mistress said, "You are clever all your life, but foolish for a moment. Think about it, someone like mother who loves you so much, would she let you know that she's sick? When you get close to her, she immediately puts on a full display of energy, smiling at you even if she doesn't feel like it, talking even if she doesn't want to. If you don't know what's on her mind, how would you know that she has a hidden illness?" Hearing her sister-in-law's report, Menglan's face immediately became more somber, and she sat up even straighter to show her attention to the matter. Then she looked at the Second Young Mistress and asked, "Does father know about this?" The Second Young Mistress said, "Maybe he knows a little bit, but mother definitely wouldn't tell father the truth, because if father knew mother was sick, he would definitely advise her to take medicine." Menglan said, "Of course, no one wants to take medicine, but good medicine tastes bitter but is beneficial to the illness, and it must be taken. Even if mother hides it, the two young mistresses can reveal a little bit to father." The Second Young Mistress nodded and said, "Girl, how come you still don't understand? Mother doesn't have some kind of cold or digestive illness. The problem is that she has many knots in her heart. If you don't untie those knots and just keep telling her to drink bitter medicine, what's the use?" Menglan said, "According to Second Sister-in-law, the situation is quite serious!" The Second Young Mistress followed the words, and also frowned, because Dao: "Serious is nothing serious, but the old man always seems to have a bad feeling in his heart. I think, if my sister persuades him, then maybe his heart will be relieved." Menglan said, "How can I persuade him?" As she said this, her face added another layer of redness. The Second Young Mistress also squinted at him, but his attitude was very calm, and he smiled slightly: "What do you not understand about this? A mother is always closer to her daughter, and if you can roll around in the old woman's arms a couple of times, then of course the old lady will be happy." A big stone in Menglan's heart just fell down. Because of Dao: "I thought you were saying that I had some magic medicine that could cure the old lady's illness, but it turned out that you were saying this. This method, no matter how embarrassed a person as big as me is to do it, even if I am embarrassed to do it, it will only make him smile temporarily. If the mother has some psychological illness, as the saying goes, psychological illness still needs psychological medicine." The Second Young Mistress smiled, and did not follow up on this. After Menglan said that, she also sat silently. A series of footsteps echoed on the stairs, and Little Ju was holding four plates in his arms with both hands. The Second Young Mistress said, "Look at what this child is doing, isn't he just looking for a scolding? How can you carry four plates upstairs at once?" (136)</p>
<h3>An Old Horse's Escape from Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>In 1927, when the British garrison withdrew from Shanghai, there was a fine steed in the army. Having served for many years and achieved military feats, the entire army gave it the name "Old Horse" and loved it dearly. Unwilling to make it travel across the ocean again and endure the hardships of a long march, they gave it, along with several other horses, to a certain foreign corps in Shanghai, with the agreement that "under no circumstances should it be sold." They hoped that the "old soldier" could enjoy its life in peace from then on, like a warrior returning to his fields, but unexpectedly, it suffered greatly as a result. If it hadn't been rescued in time, it would have been left in a ditch to die without anyone knowing its end. Its new owner forgot the agreement, or deliberately broke his promise. At first, he used "Old Horse" for hire, and then sold it to the Longfei Auction House, earning eighty gold coins. "Old Horse" then entered the dark and lowly stables of Zhabei, serving as a common laborer. The contrast between this situation and its past glory, when it proudly galloped in the army and its owner loved it as a friend, was like heaven and earth. If "Old Horse" had known, how would it have felt? In June 1935, the Shanghai Animal Protection Society, established by foreigners, accidentally discovered "Old Horse" in the suburbs of Zhabei. Pitying its difficult situation in old age, they planned to buy it back, but before the negotiation could be finalized, "Old Horse" changed owners again and became the property of a bleaching factory in Longhua. Its fate continued to worsen. Even though it was over twenty years old, it still pulled heavy loads, running around without a day of rest. The cart was clumsy, and the road was rugged. Sometimes it traveled far to Songjiang, often sweating and panting under the whip, seeking death but unable to find it. Last year, the Animal Protection Society remembered "Old Horse" again, searched for its location, and went to buy it. When they arrived, they saw "Old Horse" tied in a reed shed, with only skin and bones left, and one of its feet was lame, close to death. The shed was open on two sides, and the other two sides were barely covered with miscellaneous items. A small amount of grass was spread on the ground, muddy and filthy beyond description. If "Old Horse" could speak, it would surely weep and tell of its suffering. Although "Old Horse" was almost useless to its owner, the owner still demanded a high price. The Society was short of funds and spent much effort persuading him. It was not until the Lunar New Year that they finally managed to buy it and board it at the Ascot Riding School. The Society earnestly hopes that horse lovers, or soldiers who were involved with war horses in the European War, will generously donate to provide "Old Horse" with living expenses so that it can live out its remaining years. They say that ten gold coins a month would be enough. The Society initially thought that "Old Horse" was very ill and planned to euthanize it in a humane way to relieve its pain. The "executioner" was sent to the Riding School and saw that "Old Horse" had been well-fed and its spirits had recovered. It was living comfortably in the stables and was happy. Therefore, he could not bear to do it and returned. This made me recall what Mr. Tian Guang said to Prince Yan in ancient times: "I heard that when a fine steed is in its prime, it can gallop a thousand miles a day, but when it is old and weak, a nag will overtake it." Horses are like this, and so are people. But if you meet a good master, even if you are old and weak, the master will remember your efforts when you were strong and treat you well as before. Otherwise, you will inevitably suffer the fate of "Old Horse," withering away until death. This is why heroes at the end of their road often look up to the sky, beat their chests, and weep tears of blood. However, if "Old Horse" had been mediocre and without merit when it was strong, who would pity and help it when it was in dire straits? Many other old horses have suffered the same fate as "Old Horse," but none have been rescued and escaped misfortune. As the ancient saying goes, "If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only grieve when you are old." This is indeed a wise saying.</p>

<p>Observing the relationship between the Earth and other celestial bodies allows us to predict future changes in the seasons and calculate all the times. Recording it daily in a book, which can provide a correct and orderly basis for human life, is called a calendar. There are lunar and solar calendars. The "lunar calendar," also known as the lunar calendar, is based on the waxing and waning of the moon, using the time it takes for the moon (the moon) to orbit the Earth once as its basis. Examples include the Mohammedan calendar, the Chinese calendar, the Greek calendar, the Indian calendar, the Babylonian calendar, the Jewish calendar, etc. In ancient times, human life was closely related to the movements of the moon, and it is still important today for tidal ebb and flow and ship transportation. Therefore, the lunar calendar cannot be abolished even today. Later, it was discovered that the sun was the center of activity, and the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the sun (the day) once was taken as the standard, totaling 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 46 seconds. Removing the fractional number, 365 days are set as a year, and the fractional number exceeding four years is 23 hours and 15 minutes, which is taken as one day and added to the leap fourth year. In this way, there are only three days in four hundred years. However, the actual movement of the Earth is later than the calendar, so to prevent it, the year whose Western Era number 4 is removed as a leap year. Also, at the end of the number of the Western Era, the year attached with two zeros is a leap year with the year removed by 400, and the year without removal is a common year. The solar calendar used in this way includes the Egyptian calendar, the Persian calendar, the Julian calendar, and the Gregorian calendar currently used in the world. The origin of the solar calendar was in the era of King Romulus of Rome before 750 BC. After various improvements, it has been implemented to this day. We pass one day after another without any special feelings, but the number of days each day, such as February 28 and July-August 31, are very unequal. The month of 28 days and 31 days has four Sundays, people who live on monthly wages, apart from the four Sundays, only have 24 and 27 days, so the shortcomings of the calendar should be improved. However, the reform of the calendar has become a problem 150 years ago. The French revolutionaries who advocated rationalism and the destruction of tradition were firmly opposed to the 28th day of February, and also fundamentally broke the Roman calendar and time. They advocated using ten hours as a day, dividing the hour into percentages, abolishing weeks and using decades, with one month being 30 days, and the remaining five days being attached at the end of the year. The most interesting of these was to establish the autumnal equinox at the beginning of the year, and use this day as the anniversary of the declaration of the abolition of the monarchy, calling it the Republican calendar. This calendar was implemented for thirteen years, and then it was realized that it was too unreasonable and it was abolished. However, the current Gregorian solar calendar is still incomplete, although it has been improved for 400 years, it is still inappropriate, and it has even been changed for the worse, that is, the day and year are natural units, and the week is an artificial unit. They have been trying to come up with an excellent improvement plan. In 1923, the League of Nations paid attention to correcting the calendar and set up an investigation committee to notify the governments of various countries in 1927, hoping to investigate and study the calendar. Later, two improvement plans were obtained. One was the thirteen-month case of Auguste Comte, the ancestor of positive philosophy. The case took the week as a unit, combined four weeks and 28 days as a month, and thirteen months and 364 days as a year. Therefore, one day was left over in a common year, and two days were left over in a leap year. These remaining days were the days outside the week and were placed at the beginning or end of the year. Because the first day of the year is set as Sunday, the rest of the month can also be inferred. This is the convenience of connecting the calendar day and Sunday, but dividing the year into two or four is inconvenient.</p>

<h3>"Abyssinia" in "Shanghai"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>The film "Abyssinia" in Shanghai was initially suspended due to protests. The Central Film Censorship Committee recalled the film, re-examined it carefully, and, after cutting out the most intense parts, re-approved it for public release in Shanghai. The original intent of this cautious approach was to pass through peacefully without incident. However, the result was not so. The backlash was still there, and it was even more intense. In addition to wooden sticks and pistols, there was also ammonia and other "civilized weapons." With such weapons, there was naturally no need to go through diplomatic procedures. "Might makes right." It must be joyous to use force to destroy what one deems to be odious! Moreover, although the real King of Abyssinia is now at the end of his heroic road and the Abyssinian people are now living under a "civilized" rule, the King of Abyssinia on the screen is still depicted as being so passionately plotting rebellion. Isn't this a matter that "concerns the national essence" of the "civilized" Italy? Treating the "Abyssinia" film with the same methods used against the barbaric people of Abyssinia is meant as a slight punishment and to tell people that Italy's means of "instilling civilization" are still in place. These means are not only earnestly implemented on Abyssinian soil, but will also be earnestly implemented wherever the shadow of the resistance of the Abyssinian people is found.</p>
<p>Such a "civilized" "great undertaking" naturally leaves us gaping in astonishment. However, regrettably, such a "civilized" "great undertaking" does not seem grand enough, not grand enough to inspire awe. For example, on the day before Italian sailors promoted civilization in Shanghai, in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Abyssinia, "Abyssinians who were dissatisfied with Italian rule mingled among the crowd and threw hand grenades," injuring many important Italian officials who were going to the church to celebrate the birth of Prince of Naples. As for how things will develop in Shanghai, it is still impossible to predict, but the act of lodging a protest is inevitable, and it is clear that there will be no peace.</p>
<p>Regarding lodging protests, the district branches of the Shanghai Hongri District Citizens' Association have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Joint General Association, requesting it to forward it to the municipal government and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding "strict negotiations to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, so as to safeguard social harmony." As for the central government, there has been no further news yet, but for the sake of the Central Film Censorship Committee's authority, I believe that a protest will also definitely be lodged soon. The Shanghai Grand Theatre and other relevant parties will also certainly petition the Central Censorship Committee to uphold justice. But what will happen after the protest is lodged? I am quietly waiting to see.</p>
<p>The matter cannot be concluded with just a protest. "Ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again, so as to safeguard social harmony" is too abstract a statement. Infringing on our sovereignty and insulting our national dignity are, of course, the most important and major issues at present! And what is more practical and urgently needs to be resolved is the Central Film Censorship Committee's authority. If films that have been approved by the Central Government can be casually shut down like this, how can one ask how to handle imported films that refuse to be censored in the future?</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to demonstrate the authority of the Central Film Censorship Committee and to guarantee it in fact, I believe that the text of the protest should include a clause stating that "the "Abyssinia" film that was approved this time should not be subject to any restrictions to continue showing within Chinese territory." And, in order for this not to be a pro forma measure, the original film should be shown publicly in Shanghai or other places on the day the negotiations are resolved.</p>
<h3>Water Carrier</h3>
<p>— Zhang Haopu</p>
<p>As usual, as soon as the lama of Huguo Temple strikes the bell, the winch operator, old man crooked neck, gets up. His movements are very quiet, to avoid waking up those water carriers who are sleeping soundly. He lights the stove himself, pours a pot of water to sit on, and then puts on leggings and binds his socks. Finally, he took a small oil bottle and oiled the cores and ears of each carrier's cart. Then, he sang two lines from "Famen Temple" in Liu Jin's voice, waking up all the water carriers. The kettle on the stove was hissing, and when the water was about to boil, everyone got up! Smoking, washing faces, wrapping foot cloths. Crooked Neck alone opened the trough lid. He was talking to the carter "Big Sun." "Big Sun" was the first to come every morning, leading two red horses to drink.</p>
<p>Life is rigid and mundane, and pain has left a deep mark on their bodies. They numbly live through difficult days, not knowing how to improve their lives, and have lost the desire for a good life. Recalling the past, they even feel that the present days are very happy. In the past, the Yellow River flooded, washing away their houses, fields, and cattle. Even their parents and wives died or scattered. They themselves escaped to a distant place and became soldiers, thinking that they could become rich as soldiers. However, after fighting several battles, it was not them who were promoted and made money, but those officials. Disappointed, they had to risk their lives to "desert." Now they finally had a means of livelihood, earning three or five yuan a month. Let's keep this job, wishful thinking cannot solve hunger and thirst. They are completely obedient and submissive slaves to the well owner, earning countless amounts of money for the well owner, while what they get is pitifully small! The well owners are very vicious. People in Beijing call them "water valves" because they often argue and fight with people who use water, raising the price of water. But it is only the water carriers who suffer. They have no space for adults, working non-stop like cattle and horses, and if they make a mistake, they will be laid off.</p>
<p>The most arduous task is the winch operator, Crooked Neck! He doesn't smoke, and doesn't rest at all. When he puts down the winch, he takes care of the stove, cooks, washes clothes, and nails shoes for the water carriers! He is simply the mother of the carters. Everyone treats him warmly, and he also lovingly protects each partner. Although he earns two yuan more than others, he takes it out for everyone to spend, buying small dishes, buying rock sugar sprouts, etc. In short, the two yuan more he earns are all spent on others. He is already over forty years old.</p>
<h3>Plunging Straight into the Enemy's Lair</h3>
<p>— Megatron</p>
<p>Using powerful forces to plunge straight into the enemy's lair, exterminating bandits and thieves, can be called a great pleasure.</p>
<p>When gonorrhea first begins, it is often due to mistakenly taking inferior medicine or being careless with washing, causing the bacteria to penetrate deep into the urethra and invade the testicles, resulting in inflammation of the testicles and swelling pain in the urethra, as if being cut by a knife.</p>
<p>The new medicine "Deli Ping" combines various components whose power can completely kill the stubborn gonorrhea bacteria that have deeply penetrated the urethra. At the same time, it can exert its anti-inflammatory, astringent, pain-relieving, and turbidity-clearing effects on inflamed conjunctiva, absolutely without harming the stomach and intestines, kidneys, or any other side effects. Among internal gonorrhea medicines, this can be called the most perfect preparation, far beyond what other ordinary and superficial medicines can compare with.</p>
<p>Taking the new medicine "Deli Ping" to plunge straight into the enemy's lair and kill gonorrhea bacteria is also a great pleasure.</p>
<h3>Women's Lecture</h3>
<p>— Hu Huizhen</p>
<p>Reasons for Weakness</p>
<p>We women in general are weak because of insufficient exercise; depressed because of living in seclusion; blood-deficient because of believing in the menstrual cycle; and tired because of raising children. These are the major reasons for women's weakness!</p>
<p>Even More So in Our Country</p>
<p>Women are more prone to physical weakness, mental decline, qi and blood deficiency, aging appearance, and susceptibility to disease compared to men. This is even more so in our country's environment!</p>
<p>Remedies</p>
<p>The remedies for women's weakness, in addition to improving lifestyle, should also include taking health-strengthening medicines. Many of my female friends, after taking Wuzhou Pharmaceutical's "Women's Essence," have had all their previous ailments disappear, so I believe this is a wonderful medicine for gynecology.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>He had never married. He himself said he had never slept with a woman since he was born. Sometimes, when others talked about women, he was quite moved. If you asked him, "Crooked Neck, how about it? Want to find a wife?" he would smile with his teeth showing and go back to cranking his winch. Clatter, clatter, endless life slipped away on the winch.</p>
<p>Crooked Neck steamed the cornbread, sliced the pickled radish, and added a bit of vinegar and soy sauce to mix it. When the water carriers returned one after another, they began to eat breakfast. The three meals a day were all the same: cornbread and pickled vegetables.</p>
<p>As dusk approached, the pace quickened with the water carriers becoming increasingly rushed, wishing they had extra hands and feet. This was the hardest part of the job! During the day, the muddy streets had frozen over, but not solidly, so that each footstep created a pit. In particular, a cart full of water always sank deeply into the mud, making it exceptionally difficult to pull. The water carriers were all covered in sweat, with steam rising from their foreheads, exerting all their strength to deal with the cart. The most difficult part was the muddy road that had not completely frozen. If their feet didn't find purchase, they'd slip and overturn the cart, injuring themselves, or at least get covered in mud. The well owner would be sure to scold you severely, and who could you complain to?</p>
<p>Every evening at dusk, a flock of crows gathered in the old locust trees in the Huguo Temple courtyard. They shrieked mournfully in the cold, quiet night, unsure whether they were lamenting for the water carriers. Their hands flew, swiftly swinging the long-handled dippers, filling a cart with water in no time. Crooked Neck was also busy at this time, the water in the trough shallow and then deep, but Crooked Neck never received complaints from the cart pullers. He never let the water trough run dry, and the well owner praised him for doing a good job with this task.</p>
<p>What was hateful were the people who needed water, especially during the busiest times when they were quick to urge: "Little Wen! Hurry up and pour! Haven't poured water since early morning!" No one had time to pay attention to these people, and they kept letting down water carts, no matter how sore their arms were, they had to grit their teeth and endure. As soon as a cart was filled, they would throw down the large dipper and push the cart away.</p>
<p>As night enveloped the ancient city, the water carriers all pushed their empty carts back. They stood the carts up on the ground, removed the wooden plugs on the water tanks, and let the remaining water drain out. After taking a smoke, everyone pulled out a small coin pouch from their waists, counted the money, and handed it over to the well owner, coin by coin. After the well owner left with the money and carrying his birdcage, they swarmed to the stove, sat on small stools, and took off their soaked shoes and foot wraps.</p>
<p>As soon as the steamer basket was opened, the cornbread steamed. Everyone grabbed one to warm their hands. After washing their hands, they started eating. Slowly, their bodies became sore, and fatigue fermented! One by one, they fell onto the bed like black bears, closed their eyes, and fell asleep, unable to be awakened by any sound. Crooked Neck picked up this and tidied up that until everyone else had fallen asleep and the seller of "hard-baked cakes" had yelled past Da Yangjia Hutong, and only then did he go to bed.</p>
<h3>Night Inspection</h3>
<p>— Mi Lan</p>
<p>— Miscellany of Shenyang</p>
<p>The night was as dark as lacquer. Although it was not raining, a malicious wind was blowing hard outside. This street, which was very noisy during the day, was now also immersed in deep darkness. In the distance, only the sound of iron-shod leather shoes and gun butts striking the road planks hurriedly and abruptly vibrated...</p>
<p>For the past few days, the friendly forces had been arresting people more intensely than usual, for reasons unknown. As a result, this ancient and bustling city of Shenyang was entirely shrouded in an atmosphere of chaos and terror.</p>
<p>Martial law began at six o'clock in the evening. As soon as you stepped out of the door, armed soldiers would stop you on the road, aiming their guns at your waist in an offensive stance, and carefully search your belongings...</p>
<p>Because of this, I would hide in my room every evening, shrink my head, and burrow into the blankets. But my room was very narrow, and I felt stifled and suffocated from being confined in it all day. Sometimes, I would just push a crack in the street-facing window to get some air and also peek at the scene outside. But all I saw were brown military vehicles, brown-clad armed soldiers, and the shiny guns on their shoulders... These only added to the trembling throughout my body!</p>
<p>This had been going on for four days and nights. Suddenly, one evening, a message came from the tea servant Liu Fu, saying that they were going to "inspect the night" house by house that night.</p>
<p>What were they inspecting? - I called Liu Fu in and asked him. He couldn't answer and just cast a pair of resentful eyes at my face.</p>
<p>"These guys are really unreasonable..." As he said this, he quickly shook his head again. "They simply treat us common people here as pigs that are easy to bully!"</p>
<p>When he left the room, he sighed deeply.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at his retreating figure for a while, then turned back to gaze through the window: outside, the night continued to creep deeper and deeper into the darkness silently. On the street, all the sounds were also clearly transmitted into my ears... !</p>
<p>Less than a quarter of an hour later, Liu Fu suddenly burst into the door, cowering with his back bent, he put on a frightened look and approached my ear to whisper:</p>
<p>"Outside... the people from XX are here to inspect the night."</p>
<p>"Have they come in yet!" I was stunned, my face seemed to be burning, and I asked, "How many people are there?"</p>
<p>"There are many people!" Liu Fu frowned tightly at me, then comforted me, "It's okay, now, now they're still downstairs, but you should quickly tidy up the books, because books are the most troublesome..."</p>
<p>After saying this, he hurried out.</p>
<p>This time my heart was hung up again. But I tried my best to calm down and reluctantly tidied up the suitcase and locked it. Although I didn't bring anything, I was afraid of unexpected trouble!</p>
<p>A burst of chaotic footsteps followed on the stairs, from far to near, gradually stopping at my door.</p>
<p>"Open the door, huh!" A few sounds rang on the door, and my heartbeat became more impulsive. Finally, I hardened my head and pulled open the door.</p>
<p>A flashlight was shining directly on me, the strong light like thousands of golden flies demonstrating in front of me. Suddenly, a fist as big as a bowl pressed against my chest, and someone on this side also reached out, holding a gun in their hand.</p>
<p>They were a group of five or six people, and at first none of them spoke, just carefully examining my room. After a while, Liu Fu tremblingly brought over a piece of paper - I didn't recognize the writing on the paper, what did it mean? I was also confused, just at this moment, one of them started asking me questions.</p>
<p>I told them my hometown, name, and age...</p>
<p>They used a not very fluent "China" accent, and still asked in detail, looking like they were interrogating a criminal.</p>
<p>"You're not from outside the pass, why did you come here?" A black-faced soldier asked me:</p>
<p>"..." I moved my mouth and then continued, "I came to find a friend."</p>
<p>"Friend?" he asked with difficulty: "Where does he live?"</p>
<p>"On XX Street." I answered him solemnly.</p>
<p>"What does he do?"</p>
<p>"He is also doing business!" I still kept calm, not letting them see that I was trembling.</p>
<p>"Oh!" The black-faced guy finally put his gun away.</p>
<p>They mumbled among themselves for a while, and for some reason, they insisted on checking my luggage. The first one was the black-faced guy who violently beat the nearby boxes with an iron rod, and also ordered me with wide eyes:</p>
<p>"Open it quickly, come on..."</p>
<p>I wriggled and shook my shoulders, and with a pleading attitude, I said to them:</p>
<p>"Most of these are clothes, please be a little more lenient, okay?"</p>
<p>The black-faced guy seemed like a deaf person, his expression not even moving his mouth. Liu Fu gave me a look, and I understood what he meant, they wanted money, just now downstairs it seemed like someone was arguing about five or ten yuan!</p>
<p>"How much do you want?" I asked Liu Fu in a low voice.</p>
<p>But before Liu Fu could answer, the black-faced guy stretched out a hand. - Representing five yuan.</p>
<p>I deliberately pretended to be in difficulty, gathered all the four yuan or so I had on me and handed them over, and immediately everything became negotiable, and the five or six black shadows swayed out.</p>
<p>I turned around and looked again at the dim night outside the window, and felt the empty bottom of my bag. Is this what they call "night inspection"?</p>

<p>Falling Rosy Clouds and Lone Duck</p>
<p>Falling Rosy Clouds was a young girl kidnapped by bandits and sold to Zhao Chongfu's family, where she suffered all kinds of abuse from the mistress, Mrs. Zhao. However, she always endured and worked diligently.</p>
<p>One winter morning, in gloomy weather with a strong wind and goose feather snowflakes falling, Falling Rosy Clouds braved the heavy snow in thin clothes to go to the market to buy vegetables. Unfortunately, she was careless and lost the money for the vegetables. She knew that she would be beaten severely when she returned, so she stood in the snow and cried bitterly. Fortunately, Jiang Qiuwu passed by, inquired about the reason, and generously gave her one yuan and fifty cents, saving Falling Rosy Clouds from a beating.</p>
<p>Ever since Jiang Qiuwu helped her, the image of a handsome young man often flashed in Falling Rosy Clouds' mind. Every day, she passed by the place where Jiang Qiuwu had helped her and stood there in a daze. One day, another snowy morning, she returned from the market after buying vegetables, and happened to meet Jiang Qiuwu going to Qiuren Middle School to teach. Because she wanted to ask his name, she followed him all the way to the gate of Qiuren Middle School, and through the mouths of two elementary school students, she learned that his name was Jiang Qiuwu, and she went home very satisfied; but because she had been delayed, she was beaten all over by her mistress, even to the point of being unable to work.</p>
<p>After three or four days, Falling Rosy Clouds' injuries had not yet healed, but Mrs. Zhao forced her to get up and work. That afternoon, Zhao Chongfu returned very early and happened to meet his cousin Zhu Liufeng visiting, so the two of them were eating fried chestnuts and peanuts in the living room and chatting idly, while Falling Rosy Clouds was serving them. During their conversation, she learned that Jiang Qiuwu was a revolutionary. At that time, it was the era of warlords, and the military and police agencies were very attentive to him. Within two or three hours, Jiang Qiuwu's life would be in danger. After hearing these words, Falling Rosy Clouds secretly ran to Qiuren Middle School, led Jiang Qiuwu to Granny Feng's house next door, and told him the news that the military and police agencies were secretly arresting revolutionaries, saving him from escaping the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>After Jiang Qiuwu returned south from Beijing, he often thought of Falling Rosy Clouds' life-saving grace, so he wrote two letters to Wan You, the errand boy at Qiuren Middle School, asking him to inquire about Falling Rosy Clouds' whereabouts and giving him ten yuan for travel expenses. Wan You could not refuse, so he took the letter for Falling Rosy Clouds and went to Tianxiang Hutong to find Granny Feng, entrusting her to forward it; because there was a profit to be made, she readily agreed. However, at this time, the Zhao family had already moved to Huai Shu Hutong in the West City, so she could not see Falling Rosy Clouds every day. One clear morning, Granny Feng specially went to West City to visit Falling Rosy Clouds and happened to meet her in Huai Shu Hutong, so she handed Jiang Qiuwu's letter to her, completing her duty as a matchmaker.</p>

Service and sacrifice. Impartial selflessness. Vast river water. Misty white clouds. Solemn universe exists forever. Great harmony and universal love. Share family affection.</p>

<h3>Following the Magnificent Garden, "The Grand Assembly of Buckman's Flowers" Will Be Performed at the Carlton the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Possessing 80 actors and 40 beauties, the Grand Assembly of Buckman's Flowers has long been famous worldwide. It has toured various countries around the world, earning acclaim wherever it goes. Its reputation is no less than that of the Grand Flower Troupe. When the Haiking Bo Circus came to Shanghai to perform, a few Buckman's artists participated, and Shanghai people were surprised to see it as a spectacle, which shows the extraordinary skills of the singing and dancing. Now the entire troupe is coming to Shanghai for the first time, and the Carlton Theater on Park Road has hired them at a high price, scheduled to perform day and night from the 25th of this month (i.e., the day after tomorrow). According to the theater's strict selection of song and dance troupes, the Grand Flower Troupe performed in the theater a few years ago. This Grand Assembly of Buckman's Flowers is enough to compete with the Grand Flower Troupe, presenting a new and uninhibited style to meet the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Theme Song of "Song at Midnight"</h3>
<p>(1) Fireflies fly in the empty courtyard, raccoons walk on the high platform, people accompany the lonely lamp, and the clapper knocks at the third watch.</p>
<p>(2) The wind is bleak, the rain is pouring, flowers fall in disorder, leaves flutter, in this long and dark night, who is waiting for dawn with me?</p>
<p>(3) My shape is as hideous as a ghost, my heart is as firm as iron, as long as I have a breath left, I vow to fight against the feudal demon king.</p>
<p>(4) Ah, girl, only your eyes can see through my life; only your heart can understand my feelings.</p>
<p>(5) You are the moon in the sky, I am the cold star beside the moon; you are the tree on the mountain, I am the withered vine on the tree; you are the water in the pond, I am the duckweed on the water.</p>
<p>(6) No, girl, I am willing to be a person in the tomb forever, getting rid of worldly fame; I am willing to learn from the historian who suffered punishment, writing out the injustice of the world.</p>
<p>(7) Oh, girl, the sky is dark, the earth is gloomy, what can I use to express my anger? Only the surging tide of the river. What can I use to comfort your loneliness? Only the song at midnight! Only the song at midnight!</p>
<h3>About "A Match Made in Heaven"</h3>
<p>"A Match Made in Heaven" is a new Lianhua film that will be released soon, a domestic comedy.</p>
<p>Because of the heaviness of life, the petty bourgeois audience generally loves to laugh and relax, so Chaplin's works have a strong box office appeal, and Laurel and Hardy's antics have also become the most familiar names to the audience. There are not many Chinese comedies, and if there are one or two, they are generally lacking in oiliness and have little meaning.</p>
<p>The director of "A Match Made in Heaven" is Shen Fu, starring Han Langan, Bai Lu, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen. Han Langan plays a small worker here. He is simple, honest, and full of dreams, just like the characters played by Chaplin. Bai Lu is a poor girl who is charming and has a good heart, but the environment forces her to become a prostitute. The story is very touching, and it is subtle and humorous; there are many laughs, but it is not a riot, which makes the audience with a deeper understanding feel disgusted. The ending of this play can be said to be "tragic." Although it makes people laugh, it makes people feel heavy in their hearts after laughing.</p>
<p>The audience who loves Lianhua movies will probably not miss the opportunity to appreciate it, right?</p>
