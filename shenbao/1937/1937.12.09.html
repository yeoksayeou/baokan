<p>［倫敦］今日泰晤士報論中日衝突之最近局勢、宣稱、蔣介石將軍現有兩途可擇、一為與日休戰言和、一為繼續抗戰、相信蔣氏不致採取第一項辦法、因中國軍事方面之意見相信疆塲上之得失、並非至關重要、日軍若深入內地、其所遭遇軍事上及行政上之困難、必至重大、在此種情形下而後言和、中國當可克於屈辱也、該報稱、中國方面之此種想望、未可深恃、但日本似亦不知其所欲求者有何物、中國將裂而為二、已為明顯事實、一由中國治之、一由日本經由傀儡國治之、但此兩種行政形式、均使日本處於困難地位、蓋若日本繼續企圖擊破蔣介石將軍之力量、則適足以陷日本勢力範團以外之中國諸省於混亂狀態、而便利共產主義之繁榮、故日本在華前途不容樂觀、（八日國民海通電）</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle at Chunhua Town, Capital, Yesterday Morning as Japanese Troops Attack on Three Routes</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for Three Hours, Our Forces Defend Original Positions; Two Regiments Besieged in Jurong Break Through; Buildings in the Suburbs of the Capital Begin to Be Torched</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM this morning, over a thousand Japanese troops, composed of infantry and cavalry, along with more than thirty tanks, attacked from Dongshan Town, ten kilometers west of Chunhua Town, towards Shijiajing, two kilometers north of the town. A regiment of our army launched a counterattack, first using tanks and artillery to bombard the Japanese tanks, followed by machine gun fire to block their advance. After three hours of intense fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to break through the town. Around 8:00 AM, the Japanese troops gradually retreated, leaving behind more than a hundred corpses. The wounded were taken away by the remaining Japanese troops. Five Japanese tanks were destroyed on the roadside, along with two light machine guns and over fifty rifles. Our side also suffered over three hundred casualties. Chunhua Town remains firmly defended by our troops. The Japanese troops on the right flank, due to large reinforcements, launched a sudden fierce attack yesterday on the Qiaotou area north of Xuancheng. A certain unit of our army is currently engaged in a staunch defense.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops on the front along the Jing-Tang Avenue have not dared to advance due to the heavy artillery fire from our side. Our army is currently firmly defending the area around the Artillery School. Two regiments of a certain Cantonese army defending Jurong, after resisting for three and a half days under encirclement by Japanese troops, have hindered the Japanese advance and achieved significant results. This morning, Japanese troops continued to reinforce their encirclement, and the attacks became even more fierce. The loyal and brave soldiers of these two regiments, due to heavy casualties and running low on ammunition, were ordered by regimental commanders Liang Zhuofen and Zhai Hongyu to use their last bullets to break through the encirclement. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the death of over a hundred Japanese soldiers. They broke through bravely and reached the Jing-Tang National Highway. By 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they had all safely reached XX and rejoined the ranks. (8th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Today's battles have approached Nanjing. Conflicts have occurred in the southeastern suburbs. The main force of the Japanese army seems to intend to use airplanes, mechanized units, and artillery to assist in attacking Chunhua Town outside Guanghua Gate. A portion of the Japanese army is currently undertaking an operation to encircle Jiuhua Mountain and advancing towards Qilin Gate. Another portion is pressing towards Changshan Gate. The outposts of the Chinese and Japanese armies have had frequent contact in the mountains. Gunfire could be heard in the city last night. To prepare for the defense, the Chinese army is currently starting to burn down various buildings. The beautiful new buildings in the Zhongshan Mausoleum area outside Zhongshan Gate are mostly being burned down. At the same time, civilians have been ordered to move to safe zones. Outside these zones, only vehicles or people with yellow armbands of the military police are allowed to pass. The entire city has been declared a war zone today. (8th Reuters)</p>
<p>External news: Seven Chinese cavalrymen were ambushed by over sixty Japanese soldiers while searching for Japanese troops behind Jiulong Mountain last night. Squad leader Huang shouted to kill the enemy and launched a fierce charge with cavalry artillery, killing five or six Japanese soldiers. Three Chinese soldiers were also wounded or killed. The remaining soldiers charged with bayonets, killing over ten Japanese soldiers before breaking through separately. The Japanese troops then returned to their original positions.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] As the Japanese troops continue to advance towards Nanjing, the Chinese military authorities have ordered the burning of houses in the near suburbs outside the southwestern gate of the capital to prevent the Japanese from using them for cover. Although the Chinese military authorities have announced that they have no intention of destroying houses within the city, other structures such as bridges and water towers that the Japanese may find useful may be destroyed. Last night, the sound of artillery fire from the direction of Tangshan near Jurong could be heard in the capital. It is said that three Japanese cannons were firing there. Six robbers who were executed yesterday are now displayed at the train station as a warning to the public. The special flags of the safety zones have been raised for the first time today. The police have issued notices to residents to move into the zones or leave Nanjing and have announced that the gates of the city that are not closed will be closed soon to manage the movement of the people. Tang Shengzhi, the garrison commander of the capital, after convening a military meeting yesterday, ordered all troops to leave the safety zones. This order was immediately implemented. The anti-aircraft guns erected on Wutai Mountain near the American Embassy have been quickly moved. More military supplies will be moved out of the area this morning. A Reuters reporter inspected the safety zone this morning and saw that it was already crowded with residents, and thousands more were continuing to move in. The streets leading to the area were congested with cars, making it almost impossible to pass. Evacuees could be seen sitting everywhere on the few belongings they had brought, waiting for housing arrangements. The International Safety Zone Committee has taken over all public buildings, schools, universities, the Supreme Court, military schools, and Chinese Overseas Clubs in the zone to accommodate the refugees pouring into the area. The housing stars in the above locations can accommodate approximately 65,000 people, but there are now 80,000 people in the zone. The Safety Committee has issued management rules, requesting those moving into the zone to make private arrangements for housing as much as possible, as the buildings of public institutions and organizations will be reserved for accommodating the poorest refugees. They also plan to contact the owners of empty houses to provide free housing for the homeless. The committee also stated that soup kitchens will be set up in the zone, under the auspices of the Red Swastika Society and the Red Cross, to provide food for the poor. Mr. Patterson, general manager of the Shanghai Chinese Aircraft Parts Company, arrived in Nanjing yesterday from Shanghai, having traveled for two weeks. He stated that Zhenjiang was heavily damaged by Japanese bombing. The office of the Asiatic Petroleum Company there was directly hit by a bomb. Mr. Patterson also stated that the retreating Chinese army was in good order and disciplined. Robbers in the streets of Zhenjiang were all executed by the army. It is rumored that many of these robbers were formerly under Zhang Xueliang.</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported that the Niigang and Ozakai units, advancing from Xuancheng towards Wuhu, began operations this morning. They repeatedly encountered resistance from the Chinese army and reached Heshang Bridge at noon, which is seventeen kilometers from Wuhu. (8th)</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported that the Japanese army, advancing on Nanjing in three routes, began the battle with infantry before dawn this morning. The Sukegawa and Ono units, advancing along the Jinghang Road, pressed into the Chinese army's positions on the hillside from the foot of Tangshan Mountain. The Waki and Sakashita units, which broke through Suoshe Town, continued to attack Pushan Fortress. The Chiba and Yamada units, which broke through the natural barrier of Moling Pass, have reached the foot of Qianshou Mountain, pressing the Chinese army at Yuhuatai. All battle lines have been opened, and the sounds of gunfire are shaking the mountains and fields, becoming even more intense by noon. (8th)</p>
<p>Japanese News: Zhenjiang Captured</p>
<p>[Tokyo] News received here today from Japanese sources states that the Japanese army has occupied Qingjiang. This is the first time since the start of the war that Japanese troops have landed on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Zhenjiang was captured by the Japanese army at 9:00 AM this morning. A detachment of the Japanese army attacking Wuhu reached a point fifteen miles south of the city this morning. (8th Reuters)</p>
<p>The Allied News Agency reported that the Hanatani and Adachi units, which departed from Danyang, passed through Xinfeng yesterday and continued to advance this morning. At 8:00 AM, they coordinated with the artillery units and attacked and entered Zhenjiang. (8th)</p>
<p>⊙Local News: A Japanese military spokesperson stated at a press conference held this morning that the blockade line laid out by the Chinese army in the Jiangyin area has not yet been broken through, so the Japanese navy has been unable to sail westward up the Yangtze River to attack Zhenjiang. (8th Express News Agency)</p>
<p>Investigation of Japanese Troops on All Fronts</p>
<p>According to intelligence obtained from a certain source: (A) The 2,500 troops of the 14th Brigade of the Japanese 16th Division, under the command of Motomura Senzo, arrived in Jiangyin around 3:00 AM on the 3rd to serve as the "bald-headed" force attacking the left flank of Nanjing. This unit is attached with a mechanized unit, eight mountain guns, 385 cavalry, 139 supply soldiers, 250 machine gunners, and the rest are infantry. (B) On the 3rd and 4th, the Japanese army reinforced the Jinghu Railway line with a total of 4,200 men, with a special emphasis on the Danyang-Jurong line. Currently, ㊀ the Japanese troops on the Danyang-Jurong line include 800 infantry and 200 artillery from Jinzhou, as well as a tank unit, led by Iwamoto; 300 artillery from Yanling Town; 500 cavalry; 500 infantry from Baitu Town; 300 mechanized units, led by Nakano; 300 marines and 300 artillery from Gengcun City, led by Sakagaki. ㊁ The Japanese troops on the Danyang-Zhenjiang line include 500 infantry and 300 artillery from Maling Town, led by Kuwada; 1,200 infantry, 300 cavalry and tank units, 800 mechanized units, 500 artillery, and a machine gun unit from Tanggang Town, led by scouts Goto and two others. ㊂ The Japanese troops on the Liyang-Lishui line include 1,500 marines, 500 infantry, 500 mechanized units, and 300 tank and cavalry units from Guantang Town, led by Kusumoto and Miyajima; 800 infantry, 300 mechanized units, and 200 tank and cavalry units from Tennoji Town, led by Mori, Tanaka.

The Tanaka unit in the central line has been transferred to Shanghai for rest on the 4th due to heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The headquarters announced in a public statement at 1:00 PM this afternoon that Lieutenant General Nakajima was wounded in the left flank by a bullet while directing the battle on the first line of defense around Nanjing at 3:40 PM yesterday. (8th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Qingdao City Government Personnel Have Not Retreated</h3>
<p>[Qingdao] The Reuters dispatch from Qingdao on the 2nd, stating that the authorities would block the harbor, that officials had retreated, and that banks had closed down, is completely inconsistent with the facts. It has been confirmed that Japanese warships had previously scouted near Qingdao and the waters off northern and southern Shandong, clearly with the intention of landing. The seriousness of the situation is indeed a fact. However, since a certain army commander led his troops to Qingdao to be stationed, and worked together with Mayor Shen, they have strived to defend the territory and for self-defense. They have made strict preparations for coastal defense works and have no reason to retreat in advance. The banks here are operating as usual and have not closed down for a single day. The city government, due to the tense situation, has experienced a sharp decline in revenue and has repeatedly laid off civil servants, purely in preparation for a long-term war of resistance, without any hint of retreat.

<h3>Our Guerrilla Force Enters Nanhui</h3>
<p>According to a person from Nanhui, on the evening of the 6th, over three thousand guerrillas suddenly entered Nanhui County, all armed.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Northern Shandong Gains Advantage; Yangxin and Qingyun Both Recaptured</h3>
<p>Successful flanking attacks on both wings; Leling and Huimin are surrounded; Japanese troops in western Shandong are holding Linqing; our main force enters Boping</p>
<p>The war situation in northern Shandong has taken a turn for the better in recent days as our army has advanced on both wings. After recapturing the five counties of Bin, Putai, Zhanhua, Lijin, and Wudi, our Right Wing Guerrilla Force immediately advanced forward. At noon on the 3rd, they successively recaptured Yangxin and Qingyun and Yanshan in Hebei. The Japanese troops in Leling and Huimin are now surrounded by us, transporting the wounded away day and night, and destroying many bulky items themselves, seemingly with the intention of escaping. A strong unit of our Left Wing had recaptured the counties in western Shandong. Subsequently, the Japanese army invaded Liulin Town in Tangyi, but was repelled by us. Seven to eight hundred Japanese troops, with two cannons, are now occupying the west gate of Linqing. A team of about two hundred infantrymen were active east of Gaotang on the afternoon of the 4th, but they were also defeated by us and retreated back to Linqing. Our main force was stationed in Boping on the 4th, and a unit of our army in Pingyin also crossed the river on the 4th to support. They are now besieging the Japanese army in Linqing on one side and restoring normalcy to the politics and people's livelihood of the recaptured counties of Boping and Renping. As for the front, from Huimin in the east to Pingyin in the west, we are still holding our original Yellow River defense line. Except for occasional sporadic artillery battles on both sides of Luokou every few days, there has been no other contact. Based on observations of the battle situation in recent days, the Japanese army in northern Shandong, due to being attacked on both flanks by us, will gradually be forced to be confined to the area near the railway line.</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The Xinhua News Agency reported from the 8th that the Japanese troops in Daming are forcibly conscripting laborers to build fortifications, seemingly with the intention of holding out. The Japanese troops in Anyang have recently transported a large number of materials in preparation for repairing railway bridges. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] A Jinan dispatch on the 7th stated that artillery battles on the Yellow River defense line have occurred intermittently from the 3rd to the 7th of this month, with the 3rd being the most intense. Our artillery displayed great power and accuracy, destroying the Japanese positions. Many Japanese shells fell in the desolate areas of the four villages around Jinan. The artillery fire on the 5th was exploratory in nature on both sides. The gunfire that started at 9:30 PM on the evening of the 7th came from the northeast of Jinan and was slightly sparser than on the 3rd and 5th. It had not stopped as of the time of dispatch. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] A Jinan dispatch on the 7th stated that the Japanese troops in Huimin, after being besieged by our army for several days, requested reinforcements from Shanghe. On the afternoon of the 5th, over a hundred infantrymen, two cannons, and two armored vehicles moved from Shanghe towards Huimin. Our army has joined forces with the local militia to destroy the highway from Shanghe to Huimin in order to cut off their reinforcements and is intensifying the attack on Huimin.

<p>[Qingdao] The climate in northern Shandong is very cold, but the morale of the Chinese soldiers is extremely high. As of this morning, there has been no fierce fighting on any of the routes along the Jinpu Railway.

The Chinese guerrilla forces north of the Yellow River are still very active. It is reported that the Japanese troops in Jiyang were again ambushed by guerrillas yesterday morning, suffering heavy losses. (8th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] It is reported that the Japanese troops near Zhangde on the Pinghan Railway again launched a fierce attack south on the morning of the 7th.

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Guangdong</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Five Japanese planes flew from Tangjiawan to attack the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway at 8:30 AM on the 8th, dropping five or six bombs in Tiantangwei. They then turned to Shenzhen, the junction of the Chinese and British territories, flying low to 500 feet and circling for a long time without dropping bombs, seemingly to reconnoiter the junction point of the Guangdong-Hong Kong highway. Another five planes attacked the Guangdong Road, dropping several bombs in Yuantan, Pajiang, and Shakou before leaving. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Regarding the incident of He Wu encountering Japanese planes dropping bombs on the way to Hong Kong from the Chinese-British border on the 5th, the Director of the British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway went to Sheung Shui on the 8th to investigate whether the bomb fell on British territory and report to the British government. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] At 2:00 PM on the 8th, several more Japanese planes continued to bomb both the Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railways. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Shilong Station and Tangtouxia on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were bombed again by Japanese planes this morning, but there was no significant damage. The Guangdong-Hong Kong train is still running. (8th Express News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Qibao</h3>
<p>According to someone from Qibao yesterday, a portion of the Japanese army, about a hundred or so men, are currently stationed at the North Gate, not daring to advance south. Seventy percent of the houses there have been destroyed by bombing. The residence of the village chief, Yuan Enru, was completely burned down, resulting in particularly heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Resettlement of Refugees from War Zones</h3>
<p>Regarding the resettlement of refugees from war zones to reclaim Huanglong Mountain, the Shaanxi branch of the Northwest Construction Association has decided to provide assistance.

<h3>The Route from Nantong to Hankou is Impassable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Luo returned to Shanghai from Nantong and told reporters that he set off on the 27th of last month intending to go to Hankou via Nantong. However, upon reaching the port, the Zhenjiang area had already completed the second line of blockade, and riverboats could not pass. At least two thousand passengers were stranded at the same time. Some of them returned to Tianshenggang and then to Shanghai, while many others, due to insufficient funds and other reasons, stayed in northern Jiangsu and were unable to return to Shanghai. Currently, there are a large number of refugees from southern Jiangsu in the counties of Tong, Ru, Tai, and Jing, and all prices have doubled. Therefore, those who want to go there to take refuge must prepare more travel expenses. As for passengers going to Hankou, they should change to another route, as Nantong is no longer a shortcut.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Meeting Discusses Peace Terms</h3>
<p>German Ambassador to Japan Has Long Talk with Hirota; British and French Concerned About Far East Situation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, Japanese newspapers all carry rumors that the Nanjing government is about to propose peace talks. This news is based on the fact that the German Ambassador to Tokyo, Dr. Herbert von Dirksen, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota for forty minutes yesterday, and that the German government has informed the Japanese government in detail about the recent mediation efforts of the German Ambassador to China, Dr. Oskar Trautmann, in Nanjing. Japanese newspapers all stated that the Japanese cabinet held a meeting last night to discuss peace terms. The newspapers also heatedly debated whether to negotiate with General Chiang Kai-shek or to overthrow Chiang and replace him with a government more acceptable to Japan. At the same time, it is heard that the Japanese troops advancing to Nanjing are now stationed in the suburbs, temporarily halting their offensive in the hope that China will change its government, which would be tantamount to Nanjing's unconditional surrender. It is also heard that Japanese military authorities do not want Nanjing to suffer the terror of an attack. Japanese cabinet members are currently busy debating: ㊀ If General Chiang Kai-shek retreats to western China to wage a long-term war, ㊁ If Chiang steps down and a new government emerges, what policy should Japan adopt? (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When the Foreign Ministry spokesperson met with reporters today, he was asked about the hope for peace in the Sino-Japanese War. The spokesperson replied that Japan's peace plan has not yet been formulated. When China asks for peace, Japan will consider the peace terms. The spokesperson also said that the rumor that British Ambassador Sir Robert Clive had consulted with the Foreign Ministry expressing a willingness to mediate is untrue. He believes that Britain may be advising China to negotiate directly with Japan. Germany, Italy, and the United States are all very concerned about Far Eastern affairs and may take similar actions as Britain. We are now awaiting good results from such activities. Japan does not need to anticipate anything else. He believes that the Japanese government is still adhering to its policy of having no territorial ambitions in China. However, if there are changes in the overall situation in China, Japan's wishes will also change accordingly. At the same time, he has not seen any signs of China changing its policy of resisting Japan. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Tokyo Sir Robert Clive visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota today to discuss the overall situation in China, as well as the military parade in the public concession on December 3 and the bombing of two British ships by Japanese aircraft in Wuhu on December 5. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the war between China and Japan, diplomatic sources here recently stated that once Nanjing falls, a new government may be established in the areas occupied by the Japanese army. At that time, Japan may negotiate with it to sign a peace treaty. Japanese sources here say that the future peace treaty must recognize Japan's various special interests in China, and Japanese troops will be stationed in the occupied territories to prevent anti-Japanese propaganda. As for Chinese customs, Japan respects the current system but will demand preferential treatment for Japan. The claim that the occupied territories cannot be developed due to a lack of capital is not accurate. Japan will establish various new industries in North China, and Japanese financial circles will provide credit loans. These loans will be promoted by issuing paper money and repaid within ten or fifteen years. In this way, these new industries will not have to rely entirely on European capital. However, if Japan's friendly countries want to participate in management, that is another matter. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding whether the Japanese army will continue to advance after capturing Nanjing, newspapers here have recently commented, all expressing anxiety. The Times wrote, "China still has the strength to continue to resist. General Chiang Kai-shek will not seek a humiliating peace. Moreover, Chiang knows that the war will be prolonged, Japan will feel greatly inconvenienced, and it will not want to expand its responsibilities indefinitely." The Daily Mail wrote, "After the fall of Nanjing, the Japanese army may be willing to reorganize the vast areas it has already occupied and may not want to advance further. In this way, it will be easier to begin negotiations on peace terms between China and Japan." The News Chronicle wrote, Japan may use "Manchukuo" as a blueprint and strive to establish a new government within China, but Japan's attitude is the biggest key, as Japan urgently needs to borrow money from foreign countries. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] Today, The Times commented on the recent situation in the Sino-Japanese conflict, declaring that General Chiang Kai-shek now has two options: one is to cease fire and make peace with Japan, and the other is to continue to resist. It is believed that Chiang will not take the first option, because Chinese military opinion believes that the gains and losses on the battlefield are not of paramount importance. If the Japanese army penetrates deep into the interior, the military and administrative difficulties it encounters will be significant. Only after this situation can peace be made, and China can overcome humiliation. The newspaper stated that this expectation on the Chinese side should not be relied upon too deeply, but Japan also seems to not know what it wants. It is clear that China will be split into two: one governed by China, and one governed by Japan through a puppet state. However, both of these forms of administration put Japan in a difficult position. If Japan continues to try to defeat General Chiang Kai-shek's forces, it will only plunge the Chinese provinces outside Japan's sphere of influence into chaos and facilitate the flourishing of communism. Therefore, Japan's future in China is not promising. (National Maritime News, 8th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The recent developments in the Sino-Japanese War have made the newspapers here extremely concerned about China's future. The Paris News stated that whether Japan can win in a political sense is a more important question. The newspaper suggested that Japan should follow the example of the German statesman Bismarck in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and not go too far. (National Maritime News, 8th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Newspapers here are very concerned about how the war between China and Japan will end. The Radical Socialist Party's "Business Report" stated that Germany's mediation efforts do not seem to be what Japan wants. On the contrary, it wants to continue to advance. American public opinion may have to wait until China is defeated before it awakens. As for Britain and France, they have failed to help General Chiang Kai-shek so far. On the contrary, the tripartite alliance composed of Germany, Italy, and Japan has an excellent opportunity in the Far East. The Radical Socialist Party's "Era Report" stated that although Japan has an advantage in armaments, the continuation of the war is also a problem for Japan. If the countries concerned only provide China with the necessary military equipment and financial assistance, the Sino-Japanese War will become a war of attrition, which will be unfavorable to Japan. The Radical Socialist Party's "Republican Report" stated, "Although Japan has won a battle, China's strength to resist can still last for a long time." The moderate "Order Report" stated, "If Japan can establish peace with China, China will become Japan's vassal, and in the future, when something happens, it will use its 400 million population as Japan's backing. How can this not frighten Western European countries?" (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Our Country Resolves to Resist to the End</h3>
<p>Unless Japan Changes its Policy: Declaration by Our Embassy in Switzerland</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Chinese Embassy in Switzerland declared today that, according to a semi-official report from Hankou, China has rejected Germany's mediation of the Far Eastern War. Although the Chinese authorities expressed gratitude for the mediation of German Ambassador Trautmann, the Chinese government is determined to continue to resist until Japan shows sincerity in respecting China's territorial and administrative integrity.

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong and Others Take Office in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Newly appointed Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Hangzhou at 8:00 AM on the 6th. In the afternoon, he met with Wu Tingli, Director of the Construction Department, Wang Xianqiang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Xu Shaodi, Director of the Education Department, and Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Finance Department, and took office at the same time. Huang met with reporters at 5:00 PM and said that his administrative policy, during this period of resistance, is based on the four words "concise and simple." He aims to consolidate the provincial administration system and organization in an extremely simple way and develop the strength of political civilians to supplement the inadequacy of the military. In the past, the military and administration could not be integrated, and the civilians could not be integrated with the army due to political relations, which resulted in no practical results. This is a phenomenon that we are dissatisfied with. Now, we will start anew with the people and work together. I firmly believe that a glorious and outstanding page will be left in the history of the nation. Zhejiang will definitely make a great contribution to the national resistance. He also said that he is extremely optimistic about the future of the war. Looking at it from a broad perspective, the final victory will definitely belong to us.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Observes the Situation and Then Decides on War or Peace with Japan</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Fight Alone Without Support from Other Countries; Air Force Strength Far Surpasses Germany's</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources here today, Soviet Russia has notified Britain and France that it is unwilling to fight Japan alone without the support of other countries. Observers familiar with the situation believe that the issue of Soviet Russia's war or peace with Japan still depends on the development of the international situation before a decision can be made. However, the Soviet air force is indeed very formidable. Even after transferring a thousand aircraft to China, its strength is still above Germany's. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Envoy Ishii Arrives in Britain to Confer on the Far Eastern Situation</h3>

After arriving, he met with important Japanese figures in Britain and had a meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigeru Yoshida. He plans to visit British Foreign Minister Eden in the coming days to discuss the Far Eastern situation.

However, Japan does not ask Britain to mediate. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Minister Eden met with Japanese Ambassador Shigeru Yoshida today and had a long discussion on the Far Eastern situation. According to diplomatic sources, the Foreign Minister informed Ambassador Yoshida of the British government's thoughts and adopted position regarding Japan's actions in China and reiterated the views he had clarified in the House of Commons yesterday, namely that acts of a provocative nature, such as the parade of Japanese military units in the Shanghai Public Concession, were of no benefit. In addition, Viscount Kikujiro Ishii, a member of the Japanese Privy Council, has arrived in London and plans to meet with Foreign Minister Eden. Ambassador Yoshida facilitated the introduction and arranged a date. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>[London] Regarding the bombing of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. steamer "Teh Hwa" and the Taikoo &amp; Co. steamer "Tungchow" by Japanese aircraft on the Wuhu River a few days ago, British officials have confirmed that Commander Hasegawa of the Japanese Third Fleet has dispatched his chief of staff to visit Sir Charles Little, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, to apologize to him. British officials attach great importance to this move, because both merchant ships were marked with the British flag and were easily identifiable, but they were bombed by the Japanese, causing great damage. One British sailor and two Chinese sailors were injured. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Active Guerrilla Warfare Around Muling</h3>
<p>A Small Japanese Unit Captured</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News carried a dispatch from Harbin on November 23, stating that a large number of Japanese troops had passed through here last month. Most of them arrived here from Japan via Sansing and Dalian, and then went to various locations on the border, fearing a sudden attack by the Soviet Union. In addition, several trains loaded with troops went east because guerrilla warfare was very active in Muling, Imianpo, Yike River, and other places, and there have been several fierce battles. Near Muling, a team of Chinese guerrilla fighters attacked a small team of Japanese soldiers. All the Japanese soldiers were killed or captured. A few days later, the Japanese army found the body of the team's officer, whose head had been cut off. The Japanese army later captured about twenty guerrilla fighters. The guerrillas constantly attacked the residences of Japanese and Koreans in the northern and northeastern districts. Now that a large army has been sent to suppress them, they should be able to stop them. A few weeks ago, the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin stopped issuing passports to foreigners going to Europe via Western Siberia, causing several travelers to return to China or Japan and take other routes to Europe. However, a few days ago, the passports were reissued as usual, so several British, French, and German people took this route to return to Europe. In the past few weeks, robberies in the streets of Harbin have become increasingly frequent. The Japanese vice-consul was also robbed and punched in New Town Street. A strict plan has been decided to curb these bandits. Now, residents mostly dare not go out at night.</p>
<h3>Japanese Establish Oil Refinery in Fushun</h3>

(The patent rights for the hydrogenation method have been acquired by Japan.) It is expected that the heavy oil needed by the Japanese fleet can be completely supplied within a year and will no longer depend on foreign countries. It is not yet known whether this refinery was built by Germany, but most of its machinery will be purchased from Germany and installed by German technicians. This has been largely decided.

<h3>Tani Masayuki to be Transferred to Beijing as Councilor</h3>
<p>▲The Osaka Asahi Shimbun said that Tani Masayuki, the minister to Austria, is currently on leave returning to his country. After he arrives in the country, he will be sent to Beiping to serve as a councilor at the Embassy of the Republic of China. Currently, Councilor Morishima is stationed in Beijing. The reason for sending Tani again is that Tani is Morishima's senior, and it is meant to realize the system of a large councilor system. That is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is trying to cope with the progress of various construction projects in North China and the trends of political economy in North China. Judging from the current situation, Ambassador Kawagoe cannot leave Shanghai, so Tani is specially appointed to be the head of the Beijing Embassy.</p>

Naval observers in the Far East view this move as an attempt to resist Japan's ambition to advance south or outside China. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Singapore Port Construction Project</h3>
<p>Nearing Completion</p>
<p>[Singapore] The large dry dock at the Singapore Naval Base, which can float the largest battleships, has been completed. The dock is 2,000 feet long and 130 feet wide, which is 25 feet longer and 12 feet wider than the White Star Line's giant ship, the "Queen Mary." Its size is second only to the Southampton dock built specifically for the "Queen Mary." A large hole of 3,648,59 cubic feet was excavated within the wharf walls and reservoir. The construction of this dock, which is located on the muddy coastline of Singapore Island, forming a huge stone trough, is one of the best engineering projects in the world. A year ago, 69,000,000 gallons of water were poured into the dock for testing, which lasted about two weeks. A very deep waterway was excavated specifically for the construction of this dock. At the same time, the huge floating dock brought from Britain eight years ago has been slightly damaged. According to Reuters, Singapore naval authorities are particularly pleased with the completion of this dry dock. It is now officially announced that the entire completion of the Singapore Naval Base will only take a few months. The budget for the entire cost has increased to £11 million. The expenditure for this year is estimated at £640,000. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>London Silver Market</h3>
<p>Gradually Stabilizing</p>
<p>[London] At the opening of the silver market today, everyone expected it to rise by one to three French francs, but the rise was very small, so everyone was surprised by the afternoon. It is heard that if there had not been a surge of sales from India today, the price of silver would have soared. A certain factor related to the sale of single orders also curbed the rise in prices. After the market price was set, people in the silver market all turned to discussing the quantity sold in the market yesterday afternoon and purchased by the United States, some saying 750,000 ounces and others saying as much as 1,500,000 ounces. After today's market price was set, India turned into a buyer, offering a high price of 1/25, but sellers were unwilling to let go. It is now believed that the United States has also asked to sell to the United States, but brokers have not done so because of the sellers' attitude. Arbitrageurs are also willing to purchase and transport to New York. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

At that time, the British government sent 10,000 volunteers to Spain to help the Spanish people. Today, we should also help the Spanish people with volunteers, as we have done in the past." Attlee then spoke, roughly stating, "I deeply disagree with the British government's attitude towards the Spanish Republican government." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Turkish Capital – It is reported that French Foreign Minister Delbos will come here for a visit in February next year. In 1926, Turkey signed a treaty of friendship with Syria, stipulating that all disputes between Turkey and Syria should be submitted to arbitration for resolution. The annex recognized the special status of the Alexandretta region of Syria. After the Alexandretta autonomy issue was resolved, the Turkish government announced the abolition of the treaty on the 6th of this month. Therefore, when the French Foreign Minister goes to Turkey, he will hold talks with the Turkish government to enable Turkey and Syria to continue to sign a treaty of friendship on a new basis. After the Turkish Parliament recently discussed the Alexandretta issue, the Turkish government's views on the future relationship between Turkey and Syria are quite inconsistent. France, on the other hand, has not yet completed its mandate over Syria. Therefore, in future negotiations, France will protect Syria's rights. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Our Army in Shanxi Province is Perfectly Equipped</h3>
<p>Each Line Adopts Guerrilla Tactics; Order Gradually Established in Recovered Counties</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Linfen, 8th – A reporter recently went to the front line to inspect the situation. At a certain place, he met a certain senior general and asked about the actual situation on the Jinzhong and Jin-Sui Highway lines. According to him, after our army recovered Pingyao, it has advanced to an area 15 miles south of Qixian. There are currently only a few hundred Manchu-Mongolian troops remaining in the county seat, and they will be completely annihilated soon. On the Jin-Sui Highway, after our army recovered Zihongkou, it also recovered the mountains on the left flank. The Japanese army in all the mountains on the right flank is also being surrounded. Recently, our army has adopted a guerrilla and steady approach, with the aim of preventing the Japanese army from escaping. Therefore, progress has been slightly slower. It is gratifying that the replenishment and equipment of our army on the Jinzhong, Jindong, and Jinxi lines have been perfected, and the defense is extremely solid. They can attack at any time. As for the Japanese army's recent reluctance to actively invade the south, there are three main reasons: (1) to clear the rear; (2) to stabilize Taiyuan; (3) to replenish its strength. The guerrillas and people's self-defense forces in Jinzhong, Pub, and Bei are unusually numerous and active, and the Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. According to intelligence reports, the unit of Japanese commander Itagaki has recently been transferred to Zhangjiakou, and it is said that Itagaki himself has also arrived in Zhangjiakou. The atmosphere in Outer Mongolia towards Korea and Japan is becoming increasingly tense. The Japanese army hopes that the Sino-Japanese War will end as soon as possible to prevent the Outer Mongolian army from attacking its rear. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

The Japanese front line is currently between Qixian and Pingyao.

According to well-informed Japanese sources, there are a total of 15 divisions of the Chinese army in southern Shanxi, including two divisions of the Red Army. About 14 divisions of the Chinese army are stationed between Tongguan and Zhengzhou. About 5 divisions are stationed on the north side of the Pinghan Railway to the Yellow River.

<h3>Panchen Lama's Will</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Yushu, 8th – When the Panchen Lama passed away, he left a will, which was signed by two ancient Buddhist instructors. The translation of the will is as follows: The great wish of my life is to support the Central Government, promote Buddhism, promote the unity of the five ethnic groups, and jointly protect the prosperity of the country. In the past 15 years, I have traveled extensively in the interior, and I have been deeply favored by the Central Government. I have seen that the Central Government truly respects religion and treats the Tibetan people equally. My heart is comforted, and my belief is strengthened. This time, I was dispatched to preach in the western frontier, and I planned to return to Tibet, but I did not expect that my ambition would not be fulfilled, and I passed away halfway. Now, I have a few things to entrust as follows: (Omitted) As for the guns of the Xuanhua Envoy's Office, except for those used by the guards and staff for self-defense, the rest should be dedicated to the Central Government to jointly overcome the national crisis, and they should be returned when I am reincarnated. Also, the rights enjoyed by the past Panchen Lamas should be restored as soon as possible. Finally, I hope that my Tibetan officials and people will adhere to the spirit of the Central Government's five-ethnic-group nation-building and strive for friendship between China and Tibet. Zhasasuma and the various Buddhist instructors should especially carry on my will to promote its realization. This is my will. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

At this time of national crisis, I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear of his passing. All matters after his death, I hope that the colleagues of the Envoy's Office and the local civil and military officials will handle with caution and take care to maintain them. This is of utmost importance. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Bishop Yu Bin Appeals to the World</h3>
<p>The Chinese Nation is Trapped in Deep Water and Fire; Can the People of Civilized Countries Remain Unmoved?</p>
<p>[Paris] Dr. Yu Bin, Bishop of the Nanjing Region of China, recently met with King Leopold III in this country, Cardinal Baillemaud, and then visited the tomb of the late Cardinal Van Roey in the Netherlands, and prayed before the tomb. He also visited Mota, Chairman of the Federal Executive Council in Switzerland, and visited Pope Pius XI in Rome. He is scheduled to come here on the 9th of this month, and will be hosted by the Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun. Yu will publish a booklet in Louvain City in this country within a few days, entitled "An Appeal to Good and Pious People All Over the World Regarding the War in the Far East," to explain the predicament China is encountering. The content roughly states, "The blood spilled in China is innocent blood. This is my responsibility, and I must tell you. Can you remain unmoved by the suffering of these innocent people? The pretext used by the Japanese army to invade China has no basis. Japan wants China to resist communism, but communism is gradually disappearing in China. In recent years, the construction work carried out in the Republic of China has been extensive, and General Chiang Kai-shek's 'New Life Movement' is also powerful. This movement can gradually bring the spiritual life of the Chinese people closer to Christian ideals. Now, this work has been hindered by another ethnic group of the same language and race. We originally wanted to befriend this ethnic group, but they have struck us and even slandered us. Driven by our conscience, we have no choice but to appeal to world justice."

<h3>Protest Against the Great Eastern Hotel Incident Has Been Delivered</h3>
<p>Delivered to the Japanese Consul by the Leading Consul; The Consular Body Will Hold a Meeting Soon; Fessenden Clarifies the Principles of the Protest</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) submitted a serious protest to the Leading Consul, Norwegian Consul-General Mr. Aal, regarding the incident of Japanese military police entering the Great Eastern Hotel to arrest people. According to SMC Director-General Fessenden, speaking to a representative of the Shanghai Times, the written protest is based on the violation of the SMC's legal police authority by the Japanese military police. As a rule, the protest will be personally delivered to the Japanese Consul-General by the Leading Consul, and they will discuss it in person. It is impossible to predict whether this will be done this time. Although Fessenden could not reveal the full text of the protest letter, he briefly described its content, stating that it clearly explained the SMC's police authority in the Shanghai International Settlement. The actions of the Japanese military police disregarded this police authority. People of any country cannot arrest residents in the Settlement without the permission of the SMC Police Department. The actions of the Japanese military police on Sunday morning were neither notified to the police authorities nor were they approved by the police authorities. Fessenden also stated that the SMC had also protested to the Leading Consul on Saturday regarding the Japanese army parade in the Settlement on Friday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy announced last night that Leading Consul Mr. Aal had delivered the protest letter submitted to him by the SMC to the Japanese Consul-General yesterday afternoon. This matter is currently under discussion. When the Consular Body holds a meeting soon, the Japanese Consul-General will attend to explain everything.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Japanese Consul-General has issued a statement to the SMC Director-General regarding the Great Eastern Hotel arrest case. (Translator's Note: This matter has been reported in this newspaper yesterday.) The Consular Body held a meeting on Sunday to exchange views on this case, but there is no news from official circles as to whether the consuls as a whole consider this case to be closed.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Nanhui</h3>
<p>Tao Xuesheng's Troops Enter the City; No Change in the Situation Inside the City</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Nanhui County, Pudong, there have been many conflicting reports in recent days. Yesterday evening, the reporter met with a gentleman who had just arrived in Shanghai from the county and asked about the recent situation. According to him, after the withdrawal of our troops from Nanyi, the Japanese army has never sent troops there. Local order has been maintained by the local militia. Shops are open as usual, and there is no chaos. Even after the incident in Zhoupu Town, when Wang Buxian was shot and killed, the Japanese army only dispatched a small number of troops, and they never entered the county seat. The rumor that 200 Japanese troops were sent to Nancheng on the 4th of this month and disarmed by 3,000 guerrillas on the evening of the 6th is not true. However, the defenses of Nanyi are weak. Several hundred members of our advance troops from Fenshuidun, west of Dagetou Town, led by Captain Tao Xuesheng, entered the city with weapons and were stationed there. The Japanese side once sent people to contact Tao, persuading him to take the position of President of the Nanyi Maintenance Association. Tao has not yet said yes or no, but the city is currently open as usual, no different from the past. However, Tao's troops inspect pedestrians very strictly, and armed soldiers guard all the city gates, and sentries are scattered throughout the four villages, obviously in defense against an attack. The informant also said that he walked from Nancheng to Zhujiaqiao, took the 11:00 AM small train, arrived at Xinlu at half past noon, and then walked to the Gaoqiao ferry, where it was already half past three. He then took the last Meller Wheel steamer to Shanghai at 4:00 PM. The places he passed along the way were also very peaceful.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society Rescues Refugees in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Li Tianzhen and Others Go to Tongzhou to Assist the Northern Jiangsu Branch</p>

The Society has now elected Chairmen Li Tianzhen and Li Shiyuan to take staff, funds, and medicines to Nantong on the Wuxue Wheel last night to contact Huang Shangrun, President of the Northern Jiangsu Office, and then go to various Jianghua societies to provide assistance and relief as appropriate. Various local associations also plan to find ways to raise funds to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Joint Launch of a Sino-American Charity Basketball Game by This Newspaper, the English-Language "China Press," and the YMCA of Western Communities</h3>
<p>To be Held at the YMCA Next Monday Evening; All Ticket Proceeds to Benefit Refugees; This Newspaper Specifically Donates the "Shen Bao Cup" Trophy</p>
<p>For the sake of Shanghai's hundreds of thousands of refugees, this newspaper, in conjunction with the English-language "China Press" and the YMCA of Western Communities, has launched a major Sino-American charity basketball competition. After more than a month of preparation and negotiations, it has been decided that starting next Monday evening (the 13th) at 8:00 PM, at the YMCA basketball court on Jing'an Temple Road, teams of Chinese and American athletes will compete in a best-of-three series for the championship. This newspaper has specially commissioned a large silver cup, the "Shen Bao Cup," to be awarded as a permanent trophy, increasing interest. All ticket revenue will be donated to refugee relief efforts. The long-dormant sports scene will be revitalized, and the numerous charitable individuals in Shanghai will undoubtedly contribute generously and enthusiastically, achieving two goals at once.</p>
<p>Best-of-Three Series</p>
<p>The competition will be a best-of-three series. The team that wins two games first will keep the "Shen Bao Cup" for the year. If each team wins one game, a third game will be held to determine the winner. In the future, a charity game will be held annually between Chinese and American teams to compete for this cup. This year's competition is scheduled for 8:00 PM on the 13th (Monday) and 15th (Wednesday). If a third game is needed, the final game will be held on the evening of the 17th.</p>
<p>Ticket Sales Begin</p>
<p>Tickets are priced at two yuan and one yuan. Two yuan for downstairs seats and one yuan for upstairs seats. Starting today, tickets will be available for pre-sale at this newspaper's office, the "China Press" office, the YMCA of Western Communities, the Chinese YMCA, Shih Ping Foreign Firm, China East Sports Equipment Company, and the McTyeire Club. Due to the limited space of the YMCA basketball court, tickets are limited, and the audience is expected to be extremely crowded. Those wishing to obtain tickets must act quickly.</p>
<p>Allocation of Donations</p>
<p>All expenses, in addition to being covered by the three organizers, all ticket revenue will be donated to refugee relief. A significant portion is earmarked for the Shanghai International Red Cross, with the remainder going to the International Refugee Relief Association. A small portion will also be allocated to the YMCA's Chinese Children's Christmas Celebration. The allocation of proceeds from future annual competitions will be decided separately each time.</p>
<p>Chinese Team Hopes High</p>
<p>The Chinese team roster includes captain Lu Zhen'en and teammates Zhou Dayun, Cai Yanxiong, Feng Nianhua, Chen Xuechong, Chen Xianglong, Sun Baoqing, Zhang Liangxiong, Lu Zhenyu, Lu Zhonghui, Cai Wenhuan, and others. The American team roster includes Squiers, Ryan, Carson, Henshaw, Weart, Robert Shaw, Barman, Solomon, Tissaleno, Allen. The referees are Zhang Guoxun and Bailatuo. The Chinese team is comprised of outstanding athletes who have been practicing at the YMCA for days, with excellent results. Although the American team is a combined team from the YMCA and McTyeire, its strength is not as good as last year's. General observations suggest that the Chinese team is the more promising.</p>
<h3>Former U.S. President Hoover and Others Benefit Chinese Refugees</h3>
<p>Fundraising of Ten Million Dollars Immediately Completed and Remitted to Shanghai; Red Cross Movement Donation Extension Period Closes</p>
<p>The Red Cross fundraising week initiated by the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross, originally scheduled from the 1st to the 8th, was interrupted for several hours due to the Nanjing Road incident and was extended for two days, closing this Saturday.

<h3>Two Major New Markets Added in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Pig Trade and Timber Trade Market; Chicken, Duck, and Coal Market</p>
<p>After the westward movement of the garrison in Nanshi, traffic was completely cut off, and businesses of all kinds were in a state of stagnation, resulting in huge losses. However, when the war will end is difficult for anyone to predict. Therefore, well-capitalized firms have no choice but to find alternative safe locations to resume business and meet market demand. Those that have already been established, such as the pig trade, timber trade, and coal trade, as well as chicken and duck trades, have found large open spaces on Jiaxiyi Road and the western section of Laoshenfu Road in the French Concession in Xuhui.

<h3>Arrival of Yang Rice on the Chengdu Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>Arrived on the 11th at noon, handled by Dafoe Foreign Firm; Continued Purchase of Foreign Rice to Meet Market Needs and Handle Retail</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Nanhua Rice Industry Company, entrusted the French company Dafoe Foreign Firm to continue purchasing, and the Yang rice handled by the firm on behalf of other commercial firms, had a batch loaded on the British vessel Chengdu, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 11th. The rice industry has now continued to handle the registration of five batches of rice distribution, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Chengdu Arrives in Shanghai on the 11th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Nanhua Rice Industry Company cooperated to purchase Yang rice for transport to Shanghai to regulate people's food supply, the first order was for 115,000 bags, which has been transported to Shanghai in four batches and sold out completely. It has again entrusted Dafoe Foreign Firm to continue purchasing to meet market demand. Its first batch (ie the fifth batch) of approximately 20,000 bags, as well as a portion of Yang rice purchased by Dafoe Foreign Firm on behalf of other Chinese and foreign commercial firms, were loaded on the Taikoo Company's Chengdu vessel for transport to Shanghai. Originally scheduled to arrive on the 12th, according to Taikoo Company's morning report on the 8th, the vessel has been scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 11th, berthing at Taikoo Company's pier Jiangxin buoy.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council and Others Continue to Order</p>
<p>The Municipal Council and the Huainan Rice Industry Company continue to purchase Yang rice to meet the actual needs of the market, as expected. The previous statement that the rice loaded on the Chengdu vessel was entirely for Dafoe Foreign Firm and not for the Huainan Company was not true. (1) The Municipal Council and Huainan Company jointly purchased Yang rice and entrusted Dafoe Foreign Firm to handle it. The majority of the rice loaded on the Chengdu this time is for Huainan, and a small portion is for Dafoe Foreign Firm on behalf of other commercial firms. (2) The first batch of rice entrusted by Huainan to purchase was 115,000 bags, which has been transported to Shanghai in four batches and completely distributed. Furthermore, the Rice Industry Business Association's fifth batch of rice distribution notice stated, "Now that the rice jointly handled by the Municipal Council and the Huainan Rice Industry Company will continue to arrive." If the Huainan Company does not continue to purchase, how can there be five batches of Yang rice to distribute? Therefore, citizens should not be overly concerned about food rice, as the Municipal Council and the Huainan Company's cooperative purchase of Yang rice has not been terminated.</p>
<p>Rice Store Distribution Registration is Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Business Association announced that rice jointly handled by the Municipal Council and the Huainan Rice Industry Company will continue to arrive, and since the notice to handle the registration of five batches of rice distribution, limited to the 7th and 8th to go to the association to pre-pay ten yuan for cartage fees, after filling out the rice purchase application, the 500 registered rice stores in the Public Concession and the French Concession who did not register on the 7th, all went to register yesterday morning. It is understood that the distribution of this batch of rice is still 40 bags per store, entirely for handling retail sales, the price is still 8.5 cents per catty, and each household shall not exceed one yuan at most, in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Groups Dredge Sources</p>
<p>Rice industry groups, such as the Miscellaneous Grains, Bean Rice, and Rice Store, etc. business industry associations, after being ordered to be responsible for regulating the Shanghai citizens' food supply, the chairman of each industry association, Gu Xin Yi, Zhang Nian Xuan, etc., have consulted on dredging sources and adjusting specific price measures, in addition to ordering member rice stores to directly purchase national rice from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and continue to order huge amounts of Yang rice from abroad. The second batch of 26,000 bags of Annam white rice ordered by Yongda Firm from Xigong Hengfeng Rice Store has been loaded on the British vessel Margaret Jenson and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th, the third batch of 20,000 bags and the fourth batch of 15,000 bags have been loaded on vessels and set sail.</p>

<h3>Silver Prices Plunge and Forward Exchange Rates Tighten Again</h3>

In the near term, the influence of the rise in the exchange rate between the British and American currencies has presented a tight British and loose American exchange rate, but because the foreign firms' settlement of rice has increased unabated, although the US dollar is loose, it is very limited. Yesterday, the formal transaction of spot British exchange was settled by Xinfeng Foreign Firm at only one shilling two pence one eight seven five, the US dollar Dafoe Foreign Firm settled at 29 yuan 5625, as for the forward January British exchange was one shilling one penny eight four three seven five, the US exchange was 28 yuan 8125, which is still considered to have prices but no market.

<h3>International Committee Inspects Various Shelters</h3>
<p>Deep Appreciation Expressed to All Staff</p>
<p>In managing its various shelters, in addition to requiring each shelter's head to submit daily reports detailing various conditions for evaluation, the International Relief Committee also has its members take turns inspecting to ensure thoroughness. Mr. Li Guiyong, a standing committee member of the committee, yesterday went to the First Shelter on Rue Lussan, the Second Shelter on Avenue Shearer, the Third Shelter on Avenue Edward VII, the Fourth Shelter on Avenue Petit Thouars, the Fifth Shelter at Jiaotong University in Zikawei, and the Sixth Shelter on North Honan Road to conduct separate inspections. He expressed deep appreciation to the staff of each shelter for their loyalty and diligence in serving the refugees. At the same time, he gave many instructions regarding the continued progress of various matters within the shelters. According to Mr. Li after the inspection, the Sixth Shelter had just been established, and the interior was still being arranged. There was still room, and it would continue to take in wandering refugees.</p>
<p>Recent Conditions of Various Shelters</p>
<p>Since the Salvation Army was ordered to take over the Fifth Refugee Shelter of the International Relief Committee at Jiaotong University in Zikawei, after Director Qi Zhitong devoted himself to actively rectifying the situation, neglecting sleep and food, the overall internal affairs, hygiene, supply, and other work have been on the right track. Recently, the shelter has devoted itself to the development of education and cooperation projects. Yesterday (December 6), the education group of the training section of the shelter held an opening ceremony for the literacy school for refugee children. Fifteen thousand refugees and three thousand children gathered together, a grand occasion unprecedented. Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department, and many Chinese and Western philanthropists in Shanghai also came to participate in the ceremony after hearing the news. They all gave impassioned speeches. The director also led senior staff such as the secretary general and section chiefs to give sincere speeches one after another. It is a pity that this group of poor children lacks school supplies. It is deeply hoped that people in the education and charity sectors will enthusiastically provide support.</p>
<p>The Fifth Refugee Shelter of the Shanghai International Relief Committee is currently working hard to promote cooperative undertakings so that both those who provide relief and those who receive relief can benefit. It is reported that the registration procedures for members of the Refugee Consumer Cooperative have been completed, and a general meeting of members will be held tonight to elect supervisors and directors. It is expected to officially open for business on the 10th. Other projects currently being prepared include the planning of production cooperatives such as garment and woolen thread workshops. The shelter hopes that people from all walks of life in this city and match and tobacco companies can first subcontract various small handicrafts to the refugees in the shelter to provide work as a form of relief.</p>
<p>The Zunsheng Shelter at Qielie Gei Fahui Temple has been established for four months since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. It houses more than 800 refugees. The shelter was initiated and established by all members of the Zunsheng Charity Association. All positions are held by members on a voluntary basis, and they do not shirk hard work. All implementations can be described as perfect. No effort is spared in training the refugees. Work and rest are scheduled regularly. Every morning, morning exercises are held. Other activities include sales meetings, labor classes, and literacy education for refugee children. Several Chinese and Western doctors are also employed in the shelter to implement disease prevention and nursing work for refugees.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Writes to Customs Commissioner Requesting Facilitation of Reporting and Inspection Procedures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, stating: "Dear Sir, this July, according to the request from the Leather and Tobacco Industry Association, our industry has always relied on wholesale to other ports for leather and tobacco. Since the sales market has decreased in recent years, the goods sold from this city to various ports are very small in number. Most of them are packed in small pieces and transported by mail. Recently, due to the changes in the Shanghai Postal Administration, postal transportation has been suspended. These small and scattered items, transported and sold to the interior of the Yangtze River, cannot be delivered by ship due to non-compliance with reporting regulations. They can only be carried by special personnel on ships. However, there is a major obstacle at this time, that is, the pre-requisite customs declaration procedures are difficult to handle. In the past, when reporting customs declarations for postal transportation, the sender only needed to fill out a package slip with the goods and submit it to the customs officers stationed at the post office, who would immediately inspect and stamp it before it could be mailed. The procedures were originally very convenient. Now, special personnel carry small and scattered items on ships, and customs declarations are still required, but the procedures are very troublesome, making it impossible for merchants to handle. According to customs personnel, this type of ship transportation declaration must first be signed by the shipping company of the ship on which the goods are carried, otherwise the customs will not allow the declaration and inspection, nor will they sign and release the goods. However, shipping companies only sign for a large number of goods and strictly limit it, requiring the declaration to be handled by a customs broker. The customs are holding merchants accountable for such an impossible fact, which is tantamount to announcing a ban on the export of small and scattered items. In the current extraordinary period, traffic in the interior of the Yangtze River is obstructed, with only the Tongzhou route remaining. The traffic is crowded, and it is difficult to transfer a large number of large items. Carrying small and scattered items has become an urgent need and is a phenomenon common to most industries, not just our industry. The customs and shipping companies should change their methods and provide as much convenience as possible. This will not only benefit merchants but also increase the customs duties and freight income for the customs and shipping companies themselves. Our association is deeply affected by the above-mentioned customs declaration obstacles. The business of selling goods to other ports has almost completely stopped, resulting in huge losses, and it will be impossible to maintain it. We have to apply to your association for special relief. We earnestly request that you forward this to the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, requesting that you order your subordinates to accept, inspect, and issue customs documents promptly for merchants who declare small items such as leather and tobacco for export, regardless of whether the shipping company has signed for the freight or not. If it is necessary to sign for the freight before declaring customs, then the customs should first notify the shipping company, and the shipping company must be allowed to sign for a small number of small items, without limiting it to a large number of large items, and merchants should be allowed to declare customs directly, without having to go through a customs broker, so as to be fast and convenient. It would be best if the signing for freight can be combined with the collection of customs duties, with personnel working together in one place at the same time, so as to achieve cooperative results without the risk of estrangement. We respectfully submit this letter for your consideration, and we respectfully hope that you will implement it quickly and reply as well." The association received the letter and found that the industry's export of leather and tobacco had been changed from postal transportation to being carried by special personnel due to the suspension of postal transportation. This is a last resort measure in an extraordinary period. We urgently hope that your customs will strive for simplicity in the reporting and inspection procedures in order to facilitate the flow of commercial goods and enrich tax revenue. The two methods proposed by the association are for the sake of taking both sides into account and eliminating difficulties. We sincerely hope that your customs commissioner will select one of the two methods and handle it with discretion. We also hope to receive a reply.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Industry Cracks Down on Soliciting Discounting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Association received a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to crack down on the exchange of legal tender using remittance and transfer methods in order to stabilize finance. In response to recent reports of speculators advertising discounting, and also engaging in the business of gold and silver currencies of various countries, who are not members of the Money Exchange Association, the association previously published a statement to correct public perception. Now, upon receiving a reply from the Chamber of Commerce, the association should pay more attention to prohibiting and strictly cracking down on such activities in order to uphold the law and stabilize the market.</p>
<h3>Red Cross International Committee Seeks to Borrow Private Cars</h3>
<p>One or Two Mornings a Week, for Doctors to Visit Refugees</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, the general manager of the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society, wrote a letter yesterday stating that the number of sick refugees in the shelters has been very large recently. Although doctors have been dispatched to provide treatment, the lack of vehicles has delayed the refugees. This has a great impact on the health of the refugees. He has learned that senior personnel and residents of major companies and businesses in Shanghai often have private cars. In addition to providing transportation to and from work, they are often idle on the roadside without being used for other purposes. If they could be borrowed for doctors to ride in during their idle time, once or twice in the morning each week, it would be of great benefit to the treatment of refugees. He has specially sent this letter to your esteemed newspaper to solicit widely. If anyone is willing to lend their vehicles, please call 95297 to notify Mr. Du Da or Mr. Kai Enhao.</p>
<h3>Relief Committee for Refugees Adds Old Age Shelter</h3>
<p>Lacking Winter Supplies, Hoping for Donations from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The War Zone Refugee Relief Committee of the United Charity Organizations of this city, in view of the urgent need for rescue of refugees wandering on the roads in this severe winter, and the fact that all shelters are full, has added an old age shelter to accommodate them. However, the association is currently sheltering refugees, and in addition to doing its best to transfer them, there are still more than 50,000 people, most of whom lack winter supplies. It is urgently hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate generously to benefit the disaster victims.</p>

<h3>Donggou also Opened Yesterday, Making Jiangpu Traffic More Convenient</h3>
<p>Changfeng Foreign Firm Also Sails the Gaoqiao Line</p>
<p>In order to maintain water traffic between Pudong and Puxi, since the American firm Moller &amp; Co. has managed to clear the route, the Gaoqiao line has been opened as usual. However, since Yangjing and Donggou have not yet been opened to navigation, passengers are concentrated on the Gaoqiao line. Therefore, more than 10,000 passengers travel back and forth every day. In addition to the Minna and Dina ferries operating back and forth, the express boats New Jiangnan and Jiangnan, managed by the Changfeng Foreign Firm, have also joined the Gaoqiao line. Moller &amp; Co. also believes that Pudong passengers are all ordinary civilians and vegetable vendors, and there is no obstacle to public security. Therefore, they are doing their best to clear and open the Yangjing and Donggou lines. The Donggou line has now been approved to open. The company posted a notice on the pier yesterday morning stating, "Moller boats will sail to Donggou and Gaoqiao this month." Therefore, the number of passengers traveling back and forth yesterday morning was more crowded than in the past few days.</p>
<p>In addition to the Moller &amp; Co. sending boats to operate the Pudong Gaoqiao route, the German firm Reihher &amp; Co., managed by the Changfeng Foreign Firm, also started operating its New Jiangnan and Jiangnan boats on the route yesterday. The times are ㊀ 6:30 AM and ㊁ 12:30 PM. The New Customs Wharf and Pudong Gaoqiao operate twice a day in opposite directions. The fare is 50 cents per person each way.</p>

The Hengsheng boat left for Qingdao yesterday, and the Shunzhi boat left for Shantou and Hong Kong. Foreign companies are still operating fairly frequently on near-sea and north-south ocean shipping routes.</p>
<p>Inland River Resumption Awaits</p>
<p>The New Yongan, a small inland river boat sunk near the Shanxi Road Bridge in the Suzhou Creek, is increasingly sinking due to the continuous inflow of water through the holes in the bottom of the boat. It is almost completely submerged. In the future, salvage will inevitably become more difficult. The plans of the Portuguese firm Deji &amp; Co. to resume inland river shipping have been thwarted because the detained boats have not yet been returned, so it is difficult to realize them for the time being.</p>
<h3>Huikang Boat Catches Fire Empty</h3>
<p>Extinguished by Fireboat</p>
<p>The Huiliang boat, which was anchored in the blockade line on the Puxi side of the South City, was empty. At 9:00 AM, for unknown reasons, a fire suddenly broke out under the deck in the bow of the boat and quickly became unstoppable. It burned until 10:30 AM, when the Puji fireboat of the Customs Service set off for the first time to put out the fire. It was finally extinguished at 11:30 AM. The cause of the fire is difficult to determine.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Dadao Municipal Government was established in Pudong, the police agencies in all the occupied areas have been restored one after another, such as Yangjing, Lannidu, and Yangjiadu, which were the first to be established. The Tangqiao Police Station has also been established as the Tangqiao Branch Bureau. The inspector is a Mr. Zhang, who was originally an internal patrol leader at the station. Most of the people in charge of the Caojiadu Branch Bureau are detectives who were dismissed from the former Municipal Police Bureau. At the same time, a Mr. Yang is in charge of the Ximen Branch Bureau in the South City. It is estimated that within a week, the city's police bureaus will be completely established. However, according to related sources, all personnel who have already been appointed as members of the new government must move their families to their place of residence to prevent spies, otherwise they will be dismissed. Strict prohibition is required for corruption and extortion. After Nanshi is opened, its court will also restore its temporary organization, and the candidates have also been internally decided to be a certain lawyer.</p>
<p>In addition, since the Pudong Dadao government was organized, the police chiefs have been appointed separately. According to people from Pudong yesterday, the police bureau has also announced the appointment of Wei Jiezhen as the police brigade commander and Ma Ziyun as the water patrol team captain. It is said that Zhang Yong will serve as the detective team leader. However, it is not yet known whether the above-mentioned personnel are willing to take office after the announcement.</p>
<h3>Reporting Rice Shops Manipulating</h3>
<p>Exploiting Civilians by Raising Prices, Public Exposure Transferred to Crackdown</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency: Shanghai Xilianyi Association believes that the people's food has been carefully managed and adjusted by the Engineering Bureau to ensure its source. A large amount of foreign rice has been transported to Shanghai, distributed to various rice shops for retail. The source is very abundant, and the rice inventory is quite sufficient. There is no shortage of panic for the time being. The chaotic situation of rushing to buy and sell has also disappeared invisibly. The painstaking planning of the concession authorities cannot be denied. However, according to reports over the past few days, the rice shops are of mixed quality, and some are still manipulating and hoarding, exploiting civilians. For example, they secretly sell whole packages, raising the price to about 20 yuan per picul, or even cheating customers with insufficient weight. There are many such cases. In view of this, the association specially notified all sectors of the city yesterday to strictly report such cases. If the above-mentioned situations are found, please send a letter to the association for exposure. The association will immediately forward the letter to the Engineering Bureau for cracking down, so as to maintain the people's food and eliminate all malpractices.</p>
