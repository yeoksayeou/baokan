<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北的最近情勢</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>察北匪偽軍經日關東軍的策動最近又有企圖犯綏的模樣上月十日匪偽軍首領德王李守信等在嘉卜寺舉行會議時就有議决於五月中再席犯綏的傳說。本月一日他們又乘成吉思汗紀念邀集各旗蒙人有所密謀六日日關東軍司令直日從多倫飛到嘉卜寺與德王等會議軍事並飛到張北賓昌沾源一帶視察軍情。九日才返長春據張家口消息察北匪偽軍近日調動很忙。且有小股曾在紅格爾圖附近騷擾熱河日駐軍也有三千人開往察西察綏邊境的嚴重情勢。從這些消息可以想見。同時華北日軍自增加後日見活躍。昨日駐津日軍在天津東鄕又寅習夜襲。任意踐踏農家靑苗這也足使冀祭的不安狀熊加深起來。</p>
<p>此種情勢的發展是戰爭我國軍事當局對於戰爭。顯然早已準備好了。汪精衛氏日前在中央紀念週說過“人加害於我們。我們不得不抵抗。”這正是全國上下一致的意志綏遠及冀察防軍在全國支持之下遇到敵軍來犯必然能夠迎頭痛聲。予以殲滅。從半年來的事勢日本當局對於中國已有新的認職。是不會不顧慮的。照我們的推測。近日察北日偽軍的積極活動及津東日軍的演習。大約還不外乎是威脅的性質。因為在中日交涉上。我國屢次聲明的最後立塲。其主要關鍵就在華北問題。但是日本的侵略野心一天不戢。它對於這個問題就非但不會退一步。而且還要進兩步。目下英王加冕期間。有中英日三角折衝之說。而華北問題正是折衝上最大的難題正在這時候日本在華北方面再來一下新的威脅行動也許為的是要在外交上獲得些有利的條件罷然而過去中英兩國因日本的這一種手段而退讓已經吃了不少的虧了難道此後還有再因此退讓的餘地麼。</p>

<h3>英王小史與其家庭</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英王喬治六世以一八九五年十二月十四日生於桑德林漢、為喬治五世時為約克、公爵與曼麗后之次子、小乃兄愛德華八世十八月、英國王子之敎育問題、嘗經國中名人殫精竭慮加以研究、而窒碍之處終難盡免、約克公爵夫婦對其二子之敎育、主張力求就環境所許、與素封家之子弟相若、王祖愛德華七世鑒於已身昔受德國制度之呆板敎育、甚予贊同、蓋一方面固宜保持王族之尊貴、而一方面亦宜化除高自矜尚之氣習也、因是二子勝衣就傳、卽同受業於漢塞爾氏、作投考王家海軍專校之準備、並兼習法文與唱歌焉、二子每逢夏令、輒在桑德林與溫德莎雜年歲相近之羣兒中、作板球戲、冬則改弄足球、秋日則垂釣水濱、或攀山遊覽、故王於壯年、擅長諸項運動、實得力於幼年之練習也、</p>
<p>王年十四、與乃兄同入渥斯朋海軍專校、後二年、又同校於達特茅斯、王攻讀勤於乃兄、而尤好歷史•航海學•地文學•與工業地理學、蓋偏近水手生活之實際方面也、一九一三年一月、王年甫十八、隨艦出遊、六月而歸、此行不特嫺習、航海之基本學識、而復遍遊西印度紐芳蘭加拿大等地、以一擴其眼界焉、歐戰爆發時、王在巡洋艦“柯林胡特”號充海軍士官候補生、一九一六年五月、以海軍少尉職麥加巨特蘭大戰、在艦司十二口徑之大砲、戰報中曾予以“臨戰鎮靜”之獎語、英國海軍習尚平民化、當戰鬥正烈之際、王曾為其砲手調製古古茶、未嘗以貴胄自尊，而士卒亦以是益愛之、初王嘗患盲腸炎症、經醫施用手術、靜養數月、復回艦供職、至是又以積勞違和、月患瘍癱、卒以久未復原、乃從醫諫吿、放棄海上生活、然此次病後、調養得宜、體復强健、故最近二十年來、未嘗一攖重疾焉、一九一七年十一月、供職王家海軍航空隊、翌年、擢升大尉職、飽受航空訓練、方圓立功疆塲、而歸至前綫三星期、休戰約成、遂以十一月二十二日隨比王奏凱入比京、此為王生平第一得意日也、和局旣定、王乃隸屬航空部、未成、受天空陸地之考騐、領得飛機駕駛員甲等證書、王族中人駕機飛於倫敦天空、實自王始、一九二○年七月、脫離航空部、第其名仍列於在役軍官冊中、而不領俸給、再前夏其父王所頒之榮典表、王已獲空軍司令長官之榮銜、此為名譽職位、蓋嘉尚王之關心空軍事務也、</p>
<p>歐戰期中、英國靑年多以從役而失學、王亦其一、故於一九一九年十月、偕乃弟亨利人劍橋大學、繼續其學業、王所治者、為歷史經濟公民三科、其在學之歲月頗短、且不常到班聽講、而所費之光陰亦殊有裨其未來之事業、王離大學迄登極之十六年中、致力於各種公共事務、其忙碌與大多數之人民同、最先任威姆白萊帝國展覽會會長、因是得與全世界之與會者接觸、而獲豐富之經騐、王素性羞怯、厭臨大庭廣衆之前、至是不得不與各界人士酬酢、羞怯之性為之一變、歐戰進行之數年中、凡與戰事有關之勞工、晝夜工作、辛勞綦甚、就軍火部所得之經騐、證明苟能注意勞工之衛生與娛樂、則工作之效率、與勞工之幸福、俱能因以增進、故戰事旣止、乃有工業幸福恊會之組織、而以王為會長、該會宗旨乃在溝通勞資雙方、而使下情得以上達、蓋在往日、工廠之職工人數無多、廠主得一一盡識之、今則一廠往往多至數百人或數千人、廠主遂與勞工相隔閡、勞工方面若有隱痛、無從宣達、而輒因以礙及工作效率、損及廠主利益、故該會之創設、實與雙方有利、而成立之始、勞資雙方皆抱疑慮、恐其別有作用、乃開辦未久、卽成效昭著、而王之𤍠心鼓勵與有力為、王因是、且得與各種工業生活相接觸、故遂獲“實業王子”之榮號、王族中人關心宗敎	慈善敎育社會種種活動者有之矣、而從未有如今、王之專心於工業問題者也、</p>
<p>因工業幸福恊會之工作、復發生靑年露營之事業、每年舉行一次、行之幾及十五年矣、斯舉也、蓋本“人類俱為兄弟”之主旨、而使有實現之機會、每年由百餘公共學校各推童子一人、復由百餘工業團體各推童子兩人、都約四百人、聚居海濱營帳中、兩星期、無分貴賤、共同起居、日輒作野外運動、或圍坐交談、發起之初、羣疑貴族子弟不慣與貧兒同處、而彼貧兒、亦將與貴族子弟格格不能相入、乃開辦之後、不數日間、貴賤諸兒、竟如水乳之相融、毫無階級之區別、諸兒一律衣球衫短褲、分為數團、各舉領袖、實行自治、斯舉之益、足以泯除貴賤之畛域、且使社會環境懸殊之兒童、得以聯絡感情、王於大婚之前、每年輒至營帳盤桓數日、而在登極之前、仍輒至營帳一遊、至則與羣兒共餐同嬉、絕不妨礙營中每日之程序、羣兒見王蒞臨、僅片刻間、局促不安、過此卽復興奮如常矣、王與羣兒同居所得之經騐、足以助其了解民間幼童之境况、王常以此為言、斯舉今極受衆歡迎、可望永久維持、其唯一困難、不過自請參加者為數綦衆、而組織者遴選甚費躊躇耳、（未完）</p>

<h3>越界築路案兪代市長發表重要談話</h3>
<p>維護主權兼顧事實方針决不變更　如有漠視我國主權甯待他方覺悟</p>
<p>兪代市長昨日發表“關於越界築路交涉”一案之重要談話如下、</p>
<p>工部局在租界範圍以外建築通路、其唯一之根據為洋涇浜常程、但該章程明白規定建築此種道路之目的、祇限於為公園及公共運動娛樂塲所之用、且越界築路為一事、在越界築路上執行警權及徵收捐稅又為一事、越界築路在法理上的根據本已薄弱、在越界築路執行警權及徵收捐稅、實屬毫無法理上的根據、市政府為維護國家主權、不得不依法據理提出交涉、數年以來、抱息事寗人之態度、採和平解决之方針、希望能於法理事實兼顧範圍中、商得一合理的臨時辦法、在工部局本身亦明瞭其所處之地位、故雙方折衝之際、頗能相見以誠、終因日本方面期望過奢、因枝節之橫生、遂致越界築路問題、未能解决、殊為可惜、最近日本方面、非正式向我方提出之方案、正在考慮中、但市政府之交涉、對手方為工部局、日方之意見、僅足為我方之参考、市政府對越界築路交涉、所抱“維護主權兼顧事實”之方針、决不變更、市政府深願能儘量採納日方及其他有關方面之合理意見、以促成本案之解决、但如有徒知片面利益、漠視我國主權者、則解决之期、寗可俟諸異日、以待公理之昭彰、他方之覺悟耳、至最近所傳“分區解决、”“稅捐百分之五十一歸華方、百分之四十九歸工部局、”及“日方擬在虹品闢日租界”等均非事實不應置信也、</p>

<h3>夫婦同游邑廟禍生不測</h3>
<p>盜匪圖刦金鐲　夫殞命婦受傷</p>
<p>昨日下午四時許、南市邑廟內九獅路發生一似是而非之路刦案當時盜匪竟開槍四響示威、流彈擊中一遊廟之穆姓夫婦、歸人傷勢甚微楊姓男子則因擊中要害、抵院未及一小時卽斃命、盜共三人、均於紛擾中◻脫、詳情錄下、</p>
<p>羊腸小道</p>
<p>南市邑廟內有一羊腸小道、名九獅路、該路雖無藉藉名、但四通八達、實為邑廟重要市衢之一、商店林立遊人熙攘、昨日適屆廢歷四月一日、遊人更數裎於往昔、至下午四時許、九獅路中突然發生聯珠槍聲數響、</p>
<p>倒臥地上</p>
<p>槍聲起處、路人紛紛奔逃、頓秩秩序大亂、結果、發見一對靑年男女、已倒臥於附近一金仁興胡琴店門口血泊中、該管邑廟警察所余所長聞訊、立率大批長警趕到、而開槍之◻徒早已杳如黃鶴、於是先將兩男婦傷者車送仁濟醫院、</p>
<p>夫婦同遊</p>
<p>男女兩傷者實係夫婦、男名楊炳根、年二十五歲、南翔人、向業船上茶房、乃父開設一小規模飯店於金神父路B字十號、妻徐氏因偕至邑廟遊玩、兩人步入九獅路、正在金仁興胡琴店內擬購買一木魚、詎尚未成交、而禍生肘腋、</p>
<p>楊炳根死</p>
<p>兩人車送醫院後、經醫生檢騐結果、除徐氏右小腿稍受皮傷外、楊炳根一彈則適中左部小腹要害、故抵院未及一小時卽斃命、由院通知捕房先將屍舁入菱倫路騐屍所候騐</p>
<p>圖刼金鐲</p>
<p>至本案如何起因、則言人人殊、卽該管警所、亦未能獲得一正確之眞象、事後僅據楊徐氏聲稱、彼與乃夫楊炳根、正行至中途、忽見前面有一時裝女子後隨一形跡可疑之男子、並見該男子目光密切、注視女孑臂上所御之金鐲、待行抵胡琴店門前時、該男子竟欲上前作攫奪狀、</p>
<p>開檐情形</p>
<p>此時炳根遂奮勇上前、將該男子抱住不料身旁尚有同黨兩匪、瞥見同伴被執、一匪遂向乃夫開槍轟擊云云、但據警所調查所得、則謂匪徒圖刻一時裝女子之金鐲、確係事實、但抱住匪徒者並非楊炳根而另有其人、惟究屬何人、亦未發現、</p>

<h3>悼牛惠生先生</h3>
<p>— 朱恒璧</p>
<p>—五月八日牛先生舉殯日喪事禮拜中對牛先生各親友述說的演辭</p>
<p>牛惠生先生在五月四日朝晨二點五十分去世。離間中華醫學會大會閉幕日期，只有三個多禮拜。開會時候，身體實在已經不能支持；開完了會，再奮勇地到南京表開醫學教育委員會，回來就着床，一天沉重一天，以致不起。他的死，完全死於努力為公衆服務。此點使吾們都很痛心。他死後，中外人士，上自中央最高當局，下至各民衆團體，遠如倫教，紐約，弔唁函電，像雪片飛來，都推祟備至，都很表示痛惜，都感覺到中國失掉了一位負重望的學者。足見牛先生生前給衆人愛戴的情况了。</p>
<p>各方的唁電裏，蔣宋夫人說，“牛先生一生為國家社會奔走，犧牲個人性命，其所成就，將永垂歷史，非特為醫界之模範，亦全國國民之表率，一旦溘逝，萬分悲情”。汪主席說，“中國醫界失此名彥，至深悼惜”。銓叙部劉次長纪文说，“惠生先生醫界泰斗，茲聞噩耗，痛悼彌深”。教育部醫學教育委員會說，“牛委員積勞致疾，噩耗傳來，同聲哀悼”。上海公共租界工部局衛生處處長喬登說，上海工部局醫務的發展，牛先生指導之力為多，現在牛先生去世，工部局猶如失去了“左右手”。可見大家公認牛先生㊀為醫界泰斗，㊁為公衆犧牲性命•此二點决非恒璧個人阿私之言。</p>
<p>所謂醫界泰斗，就是說他的學術已達到了最高地位，像泰山的高川羣山，北斗的給衆星拱衛一樣。那未有沒有事實可以作證呢？却是有的。恒璧記得有一個害骨科病的朋友，從中國動身，到美國去求專家診治，到達目的地後，那專家問“為什麼要遠道來美求治”，回答說，“中國沒有這樣專家”，那美國醫生說，“你不知道，中國有世界著名的骨科專家牛惠生在那裏”。可見他骨科的造詣之深，是世人所公認的。他的達到這種成就，决非偶然的，乃是從十分努力得到的•他開辦了骨科醫院，施行過五千六百次手術，每次在未開刀前，一定要把外科上解剖上各有關係的書籍研究一翻。開刀的前一天的晚上，家人絕對不許和他談話，好像古人祭天地祭祖宗時侯的齋戒沐浴一般，靜思應該如何對付那次開刀的事情。開刀時候所有一切消毒手續，非親自檢視，不輕易放過。所以治療結果，大多數可極滿意。人家只知道他手段好，不知道他怎樣會好。實在都因為他能够用功，苦幹，小心，鄭重，所以有此成绩。他死後，中国骨科专家、已是找不到像他一樣的人。这種大醫家的精神，却是可以當得起“泰斗”兩個字啦！</p>
<p>革命軍北伐時候，牛先生隨軍北伐，軍隊行動，瞬息萬變，革命軍軍醫在牛先生指導之下，凡大軍所到之處，軍醫必先到達。軍隊醫務，管理得極嚴密週到，統軍將領可安心規劃軍事，所有受傷士兵，到處有接洽妥貼的醫院可以收容。軍閥時代，傷兵每強硬入院，不守秩序，不付治療費，所以各醫院都不歡迎他們。牛先生做軍醫總鹽時候，傷兵治病，一律付錢，損失照價賠償。所以傷兵能够得到最良好的治療，各地醫院都竭力幫助革命軍鞏固軍心。北伐的成功，就軍醫一項而論，牛先生也不是沒有貢獻的。但是北伐成功後，牛先生便謝去軍職，回到上海，過他的平民生活。牛先生功成不居，此種人格，實足令人欽佩小置。卽此一端，不但當得起“醫界泰斗”的稱譽，眞如蔣宋夫人說的，也實在做得“全國國民之表率”。</p>
<p>又如我國醫界，向分派別•牛先生認為醫應該沒有國際界限，分派乃中國醫界不幸之事，非常痛心•所以在他公私忽忙之中，努力把醫界團結，使得具有四十多年歷史的博醫會和中華醫學會合併起來•當合併之初，有種種困難，因為當時國人以入博醫會為榮，以入中華醫學會為無價值，死認博醫會地位較中華醫學會為高，經牛先生一年多的努力，得到雙方的諒解，才成立現在的中華醫學會，把醫的國際觀念完全打破。現在的中華醫學會，英，美，德，日，法，意，各國，的會員都有。此種特殊的組織，為世界各國所無。如果沒有牛先生那遠大的眼光，艱巨的毅力，恐怕現在醫界，除掉了舊醫以外，有新醫，而新醫又有中國人之醫，外國人之醫那種分別。近年來，牛先生並几進一步，要把外人在國內所辦醫學事業,都受中國政府的指導，以增進民族的健康。此點也已得到中外人士的同情,已擬定具體的辦法。惜乎還沒有充分實現他的計劃，他便去世了。牛先生處處為民衆着想，刻刻為醫界計劃，服務，此種精神，也的確是醫界泰斗的風格。</p>
<p>至於他樂於為公共事業犧牲個人生命利益一點，也有事實足以證明的。他非他在國內服務，時常奮不顧身地去幹，在國際間也曾犧牲過很大的精力。在歐戰時，美國派許多醫生到前敵去服務，是派先生去訓練那班軍醫的。訓練的成續極好。直到如今，美國陸軍部還是常常關心着他，時時有問候的書信寄來的。足見我國軍人雖然沒有參加歐戰，牛先生個人却曾代表着我國民參戰過的。他的犧牲精神怎樣，不難在此處見得。他見院中沒有錢的人。不繳費，也必定替他治好才放他去•所以他辦醫院，年有損失，而他絕不計較•他知道牛老太太對年老無依的婦人很是憐憫，在他老太太六十九歲的壽辰，捐出萬元，在馬橋地方辦着個養老院，安揷那許多窮婦人。成立的那天、他害病已很久，臉面浮腫得了不得，還是親自陪着母親去開幕。他當初的專攻骨科，他實在並非為己，乃是憐憫那小兒生骨科病的很多，社會上對他沒有辦法，所以去學習的。他的胃病已經害了十四年，腎病已經害了三年多，可是他還是隨時盡力替社會服務，只嫌日子不够。人家以為他總是養尊處優，享盡人間幸福了。那裏知道他却常常在病痛之中，有了好的東西，也不能吃，事情一樣要苦幹。有人以為他戇，可是社會上一部份人却靠了他的戇，得到些幫助；可是他自身終於犧牲，終於因此短促他的壽命了•再就他所兼任的職務都是無給職說，最近如卸任，中華醫學會連任兩任的會長後，接續着担在一年多的總幹事，又如所任中山醫院院長，中央衛生委員會委員，醫事教育委員會委員，法醫審議委員會委員，防癆協會理事長，麻風教濟會董事，慈幼協會董事，全國醫師聯合會執行，委員兼會計等等，都非但不受津貼，並且還要拿出錢來，幫助那許多事業的進展。你想他這種犧牲精神，還不值得佩服嗎？</p>
<p>他的一生，就恒璧所知，有數種美德，可以概括着稱贊他的：第一是忠。忠於社會，忠於國家，忠於職守，忠於朋友。第二是仁，秉性仁厚，樂於助人•第三是孝，他的母親和他住在兩處，他每晚必去問安。他自信力很强。無確實理由，要他服從，絕對辦不到；但經他母親一言，從不違拗。他的辦養老院，也是他盡孝道的一端、第四是直，他為人最直爽，醫界中的派別紹紛，往往得着他一句話，就可立刻解除•他說話毫不客氣。但理道極對。申說理道時候，也極委婉曲折，娓娓動聽，能令人心悅誠服。第五是恕，牛醫生絕對不願談他人的壞處。人家和他“道人之短”，必到“顧而之他”，只當沒有聽見。這樣的好人，一旦長逝，我們做朋友的實在悲痛到萬分，眼涙也哭乾了。他遺囑要薄葬，親友不要送花圈幛聯，以便省去無謂的悄耗，積成小小成數，去補助杭州廣濟醫院小兒骨科。又我國骨科人材，非常缺乏。牛先生生前，常常表示，如果他有能力，須設法使各醫學院都特設個骨科議座，栽培這項人材。可惜天不假年，未能完成他的志願，便和人世隔別了。希望在座各位親友能够依然他的遺囑和平生的、願望做去，助成其志，來紀念他。又恒璧剛才所說的，只是就個人所知，和所想到的說說•在座各位所知道的牛先生其他懿行，－定很多。希望大家寫述此出來，送到牛徐夫人那兒，準備彙集起來，出一紀念刊，好永久紀念着他。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>那末所圖何事呢？</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>佐藤外相前日接見外國新聞記者，述及華北問題，謂“日本並未抱有在華北樹立特殊與獨佔的勢力範圍之意”。日當局這項聲明，我們自來是聽慣的了。今假定佐籐氏的話為實，那末日本在華北所圖何事呢？</p>
<p>自治運動，是曾鬧過一時的，而且至今還沒有息滅。這種活動，表面雖由浪人漢奸出頭，背後策動者為誰，却是大家所知道的。這為的是什麼呢？</p>
<p>日本要求我國締結所謂“防共恊定”，不但駐軍强迫我們答應，且見之於廣田的三原則中，難道這不是陰謀嗎？</p>
<p>華北日駐軍，一再擴充，日不時舉行大規模的演習。這種行動，目的又在那裏呢？</p>
<p>日本對華北大局的渴望，是所謂冀察政權明朗化。這要求果屬正當嗎？冀東偽組織的成立，日本不惜用力予以支持，且又時謀擴展。這是什麼企圖呢？</p>
<p>還有近來日本之驅策匪偽軍犯綏，不也是一種控制華北的策略嗎？</p>
<p>那末日本對於華北，當不是沒有所圖了！</p>
<p>那佐藤外相旣稱：“日本並未抱有在華北樹立特殊與獨佔的勢力範圍之意，”何以又說：“但立時解决華北政治問題，殊感𣗥手”呢？只這一點，也足看出日本對華北有心的一班。</p>
<p>但日外相的聲明，原也不足為怪，我們一向何曾聽過有人公然說要對誰侵略呢？可惜這項聲明，欲蓋彌彰，只愈暴露其野心而已。</p>
<p>而况日本不但聲稱“沒有侵略中國之意”，他們甚且說在和我們實行“親善”呢？“空言親善，聞之熟矣。誠意二字，業已被汚，甚至成為笑話。”英國報這句話，說得眞不錯。</p>
<p>佐藤外相又謂：“兩國邦交，現已陷入不快之狀態，為相互利益計，實不應如是也。惟此種關係，為時已久，我人務必設法掃除障碍。”中央社記者問他：“此種障碍，果為何物”？他答道：“目前以不談此問題為愈。”</p>
<p>然以我看來，日本的圖謀華北，該是一大障碍吧</p>
<h3>平民學校</h3>
<p>— 白岩</p>
<p>一個僅能容納兩個人並行的小門，門口懸著一塊“平民小學”的藍色木牌，這就是我將生活一年的所在地了。院中有二棵矮的榆樹，風來時聲音瑟瑟的陰氣通人，這是所古廟，房屋經累年的風雨吹打，已坍塌完了。有三間東廂房是新用泥坏砌的，白木門被一個大鐵鎖鎖着，裹面是用蓆套囤著高梁黃豆粿子，幾絛桌凳橫七八糟的堆到墻角裹，落得厚厚的灰塵上，印著猫鼠的脚跡，草黃的窗紙已零落的脫下來，麻雀穿梭似的打窗欞中飛過，黑白斑點的烏糞散滿了潮濕的屋地，壁聞斜掛着黑板，那裹寫著高糧豆子的統計數目。</p>
<p>一個年約六十多歲的老頭，他掛著湘妃竹的長旱烟袋，蹣跚的迎門走來，經那個守廟的香火道士告訴，才知道他就是校董，一個光緒年間的秀才。他弓著腰坐到一方倒在泥土中的石碑上，翻起小眼睛端詳了我一陣，才說：</p>
<p>“學房里囤着村公所的糧，暫時不能賣，屋子也勝不出，你先回去吧，我找個人給你挑行李。”</p>
<p>我心裹躊躇了半天，才勉强的說：</p>
<p>“今天是縣政府規定的開學日子，敎育局才派我來的，要回去，將來縣裹曉得了，不好說吧。”</p>
<p>“那都由我担當！”他撫摸著他嘴邊蒼灰色的鬍鬚，像一個老祖父對孫兒講話時的神氣，問我會不會看陰陽宅，我袒白的有點近於氣憤的告訴他，在師範里讀書並不學些醫卜之類的課程，他把烟袋輕輕的叩打著石頭，冷笑的說：</p>
<p>“現在念書，就是掛個空牌子，沒一點眞本領，大不過白耗費公家的金錢，或父兄的血汗。我向來就不贊成洋學堂，不過為敷衍官差，沒有法子…”</p>
<p>說完便擺動著兩隻細腿，灰布後襟一飄一飄的走了。後半天，香火道士替我担着行李，重回到縣裏來。</p>
<p>開學的那天，有一個到城裹來買藥的農人給帶了個信，我僱了四毛驢駝著東西趕到那所古廟里，在睡覺的屋子安置妥當，外間已來了十幾個光腦袋，眉上手背上塗著靑泥的孩子，有一個梳著半尺長的小辮，尾上拖條大紅絨頭繩的白凈孩子，問問他，却還是校董的孫兒，地們像篩蘿似的搖榥著身子，嘴裹異口同聲的念道：</p>
<p>“正月初一日呵，新年頭一天哪，清晨五更起呵，手臉洗一番哪，……”</p>
<p>我驚異的跟他們說，並不要讀這種東西，他們一個個睜大了小眼睛，奇怪的問道：</p>
<p>“先生，那麼念什麼呢？爹說念這五言雜字與我們有用，不許看那書著猫呵狗呵的書。”</p>
<p>我嘆口氣，感到這帬兒童的精神被一匹龐大毒惡的野獸啃食着。</p>
<p>晚間，孩子都回家去了，我在一盞昏黃的石油燈前，正給一個住在都市裹的友人，寫封久別的信時，門外一陣響郎着自由車的鈴聲，我拉開門，進來的是作縣視學的子明，他由公文袋裹取出份縣政府的訓令來，忙問他夜晚幹麼還跑到鄕下來，他說：</p>
<p>“為掃除文盲，救濟失學民衆，省里通令各鄕鎮在平民小學里，附設民衆夜校一所，於三日內，將入學人數，具</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>册呈報，省里不久就派員來視察平民教育。”</p>
<p>他説得很莊重，不是平日慣説俏皮話的神氣，第二天我把訓令拿給那老頭子校董看，他很懣怨我不通世故，從帽筒里扯出張粉連紙來，滿不高興的説：</p>
<p>“隨便胡寫二十個人名字交給他，再寫張民衆夜校的條子糊在門口，不就完了。”</p>
<h3>柳絮</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>湖上春深，柳絮漫天，閒坐蘇堤，看此一天晴雪，不覺腸斷。</p>
<p>按柳絮一名楊花，實則並非花也。羣芳譜：“柳春初生，柔荑如筋，長寸餘，開黄花，鱗起荑上，甚細碎，漸次生葉。至晚春長成，花中結細子如粟米大，細扁而黑，上帶白絮如絨，名柳絮，又名柳絨。隨風飛舞，着毛衣即生虫，入池沼，隔宿即化爲浮萍花…………。”</p>
<p>柳絮非花，目前稍有植物學常識的人，都知道。“粟米大”的“細扁而黑”的細子上，“帶白絮如絨”者，是便於分散繁殖。羣芳譜雖則能够説明柳絮非花，但是，對於“入池沼，隔宿即化爲浮萍花，”這不經之説，還是承認的。</p>
<p>西溪叢話云：“楊柳二種，楊樹葉短，柳樹葉長，花即初發時黄蕊，子爲飛絮，今絮中有小青子，着水泥沙灘上，即生小青芽，乃柳之苗也，東坡謂絮化爲浮萍，誤矣。”</p>
<p>因爲柳絮的隨風飛舞，人們就説他是輕狂的象徵，唐人詩“顛狂柳絮隨風舞”，而“水性楊花”一語到現在還是一句詈駡女人的成語，然而柳絮本身是非常美麗的。暮春天氣，杜鵑亂啼，萬點楊花，輕盈蕩颺，使人懷疑這如錦芳春，就乘着這楊花歸去。</p>
<p>自然讚美的人我們也找得出來的，南部烟花記云，“陳後主與張麗華游後園，有柳絮點衣，麗華謂後主曰“何能點人衣？”曰“輕蕩物誠卿意也。”麗華在專剏艷史的陳後主和張麗華的一生中，也算最美麗的。假使没有柳絮，是不會存在的，當然這還不是讚美柳絮本身的。</p>
<p>唐書“玄宗幸建章，見楊花點妃子衣曰似解人意”，這才是正面的稱頌柳絮了。</p>
<p>柳絮在目前大概都以爲一無用處的罷，然而柳絮是有用的，唐書南蠻傳“訶陵國以柳花椰子爲酒，飲之微醉，”四民月令“三月三日以及上除，采柳絮可以愈瘡”，歳時記“洛陽人家寒食煮楊花粥”，花史“宋憲聖時，收楊花爲冬日鞵韈氈褥之用”。就是目前，我也曾經收集柳絮作印泥用，牠的輕軟更在艾絨之上。不過要弄去其中的黑子是十分麻煩的。吾鄉小孩，在楊花飛時，偶然弄破了手出血，就拿此柳絮掩上去止血。有時候也有些功效，這大概就是四民月令“采柳絮可以止血”的遺意罷。不過不是“三月三以及上除”取集備用罷了。</p>
<p>捫虱新話，“語曰：“南人不識雪，向道如楊花”。然南方楊實無花，以此知南人不識雪，則亦不識楊花矣。”江淮吳越之間，没有人不識雪的，那末，這裏所謂南人，自然是指閩粤間人，但是閩粤間的柳樹，也没有“無花”的，捫虱新話所説，實在不知何所據？</p>
<p>淸異錄，“盧文紀有玉枕骨，故凡枕之堅實者，悉不可用，親舊間作楊花枕贈之，遂獲安寢”。日來病臥空山，常常感到枕的硬而難睡，有時失眠，更覺得枕頭的不好，安得在此暮春，收集了大批柳絮，做一個枕兒睡呢？</p>
<p>關於柳絮的詩詞，實在太多了，這裏，還是介紹一個無名的妓女的作品罷。</p>
<p>全唐詩話：“韋憺廉問鄂州罷，賓僚祖餞，憺曾書文選句云：“悲莫悲兮生别離，登山臨水送將歸，”以箋毫授賓衆，請續其句。逡廵，有妓泫然起曰：“某不才，不敢染翰，欲口占二句。”韋大驚異，令隨念云：“武井無限新栽柳，不見楊花撲面飛。”坐客無不嘉歎，韋令唱作柳枝詞”。</p>

<h3>Japan's Three-Minister Conference Reviews China Policy</h3>
<p>Sato Stresses the Necessity of Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations Based on the Principle of Equality</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The first Three-Minister Conference since the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet was held today at 2:00 PM, chaired by Foreign Minister Naotake Sato. It lasted for two hours. Attendees included: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kenkichi Horiuchi, former Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and recently appointed Counselor to the Japanese Embassy in China Morishima Shigeru, newly appointed Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shotaro Ishii, Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shin Uemura (representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army Kogu, Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Military Affairs Bureau Shibayama (representing the Ministry of the Army), Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy Toyoda Sufu, Chief of the First Section of the Military Affairs Bureau Yoshishiro Hoshina (representing the Ministry of the Navy). In addition, Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe also attended, providing a detailed report on the situation in China. Important and lengthy discussions were then held based on this report. It is said that after Kawagoe's report, Foreign Minister Sato strongly advocated the necessity of gradually and firmly adjusting Sino-Japanese relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. According to some evening newspapers here, the representatives at the Three-Minister Conference exchanged views and reached the following conclusions in broad outline: (1) Regarding the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, it is generally recognized, in view of the failure of the Nanjing negotiations last autumn, that future negotiations should proceed according to the principles of equality and mutual benefit or mutual concession. In particular, regarding the so-called special trade in North China, Japan will actively assist in cracking down on it, but at the same time, it will propose reducing tariffs on Japanese goods. Regarding this point, it is said that if the Chinese side shows sincerity in adjusting the overall Sino-Japanese relations, the Japanese government will take a favorable attitude towards abolishing the bogus organization of Eastern Hebei. (2) Regarding the rumored intention of the Chinese diplomatic authorities to promote the establishment of a collective security system in the Pacific region, Japan must adopt a completely negative attitude. In other words, Japan will not change its attitude towards the collective security system that it held when it withdrew from the League of Nations. (3) Regarding the restoration of Anglo-Japanese cooperation on the China issue, the Three-Minister Conference believes that the closest possible relationship with Britain should be maintained and that existing positions should be respected. At the same time, the possible consequences of the attitude of the Chinese National Government should be thoroughly considered. Japan will respond to Britain regarding the resolution of several individual issues. It is said that all those attending the meeting also agreed to thoroughly unify foreign policy toward China and prevent any new incidents that could expand friction between China and Japan.

<h3>Ambassador Kawagoe's Resignation Not Approved</h3>
<p>Ishii Appointed Director-General of the East Asia Bureau</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Ambassador to China Shigeru Kawagoe submitted his resignation to Foreign Minister Sato, but it was not approved. He will return to his post at the end of this month, reportedly carrying new instructions. The principles of these instructions were decided in today's Three-Minister Conference. According to semi-official sources, these new instructions mark a new starting point for Japan's China policy. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Cabinet has decided to appoint Minister to Siam Shotaro Ishii as Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shigeru Morishima as Counselor to the Embassy in China.

<h3>Liu Zhi, Wang Shuchang, and Others Call on Acting President Wang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Issues Circular on Taking Office</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Liu Zhi, Wang Shuchang, Yu Xuezhong, He Zhuguo, and others called on Acting President Wang on the morning of the 10th and reported on various matters. Wang hosted a lunch banquet. Regarding the reorganization of military affairs in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the principles have been largely determined as a result of discussions between Liu in Nanjing and Yu, He, Chen Cheng, Chen Jicheng, and others. Only a portion remains to be further discussed. In the afternoon, Liu resumed discussions with Yu, He, Chen, and others, and will stay in Nanjing for another three or four days to finalize the outline, report to the central authorities, and then go to Henan to convene a reorganization committee meeting.

<p>[Bengbu] The Pacification Headquarters here, in anticipation of the entry of its troops into Jiangsu, has specially appointed Chief of the Adjutant's Office Liu Zhenpian as commander of the accommodation arrangements. Liu is scheduled to proceed to Huaiyin on the morning of the 11th, accompanied by Deputy Adjutant Feng Mengrui of the 50th Army and eleven other officers, hired from Bengbu, to inspect barracks along the Huai River. The Pacification Headquarters is preparing to move to Huaiyin. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Huaiyin] Yu Xuezhong, Director of the Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters, issued a circular on the 10th, stating: "Lin, Chairman of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, are hereby informed. I have received an order from the National Government stating: 'Yu Xuezhong is specially appointed as Director of the Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters. This order,' etc. In accordance with this, I respectfully took office on the tenth day of this month. Xuezhong is a mediocre individual who has been erroneously entrusted with military authority. Knowing that the responsibility is heavy and the talent is insufficient, I am ever cautious. I hope that you will provide guidance from time to time so that I may follow it. I respectfully submit this telegram for your review and approval. [Signed] Yu Xuezhong, humbly bowing (10th) [Seal]" In addition, Yu also sent the date of his inauguration in separate telegrams to various central Yuan departments, pacification directors of various provinces, commanders-in-chief, commanders, and provincial and municipal governments for their information, and requested that they provide timely advice so as to compensate for his shortcomings.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Recent Situation in North China</h3>
<p>—Yi</p>
<p>The bandit puppet troops in Chabei, instigated by the Japanese Kwantung Army, have recently shown signs of attempting to invade Suiyuan again. When the leaders of the bandit puppet troops, De Wang and Li Shouxin, etc., held a meeting in Jiabusi Temple on the 10th of last month, there were rumors that they had decided to invade Suiyuan again in mid-May. On the 1st of this month, they took advantage of the Genghis Khan memorial to gather Mongols from various banners for a secret plot. On the 6th, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Zhi Rixing, flew from Doron to Jiabusi Temple to discuss military affairs with De Wang and others, and flew to Zhangbei, Binchang, Zhanyuan, and other areas to inspect the military situation. He only returned to Changchun on the 9th. According to news from Zhangjiakou, the bandit puppet troops in Chabei have been very busy with troop movements recently, and small groups have harassed the vicinity of Honggetu. There are also 3,000 Japanese troops stationed in Rehe heading to the western Chahar-Suiyuan border, indicating a serious situation. These messages can be imagined. At the same time, the Japanese army in North China has become increasingly active since its increase. Yesterday, the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin again practiced night raids in Dongxiang, Tianjin, wantonly trampling on the seedlings of farmers, which has also deepened the uneasiness in Hebei and Chahar.</p>
<p>The development of this situation is war. Our military authorities have obviously long been prepared for war. Mr. Wang Jingwei said at the Central Memorial Week a few days ago, "If people harm us, we have to resist." This is the unanimous will of the entire nation. With the support of the whole country, the Suiyuan and Hebei-Chahar defense forces will surely be able to meet the invading enemy head-on and annihilate them. From the situation in the past six months, the Japanese authorities have a new understanding of China and will not fail to consider it. According to our speculation, the recent active activities of the Japanese puppet troops in Chabei and the exercises of the Japanese army in eastern Tianjin are probably still of a threatening nature. Because in Sino-Japanese negotiations, the final position repeatedly stated by our country, the main key lies in the North China issue. However, Japan's aggressive ambitions are not curbed for a day. It will not only not take a step back on this issue, but will take two steps forward. At present, during the coronation of the King of England, there is talk of a Sino-British-Japanese triangular mediation, and the North China issue is the biggest problem in the mediation. At this time, Japan's new threat in North China may be to gain some favorable conditions in diplomacy. However, in the past, China and Britain have suffered a lot of losses due to Japan's methods. Is there any room for further concessions in the future?</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Ministry Reforms Navy</h3>
<p>Emphasis on Quality over Quantity Publishes Pamphlet Explaining Mission</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Navy Ministry today published a pamphlet entitled "Two Empires Combined Fleet," which outlines the organization and mission of this combined fleet and compares Japan's maritime power with the military strength of England, the United States, and Russia. The pamphlet states that the Japanese naval authorities intend to establish a fleet with at least a limited military strength based on non-aggression and non-threats, and at the same time use qualitative improvement instead of quantitative increase to avoid being involved in the trend of the arms race. The pamphlet also states that the Japanese Navy is currently in active training, with an average of only three days of rest in port each month. Therefore, it is hoped that the people of the whole country will give strong support to the Navy Ministry's efforts to build superior maritime power.

<h3>Our Customs Anti-Smuggling Team Should Urgently Restore Armament</h3>
<p>Merle Davis Arrives in England to Discuss Smuggling Situation in North China</p>
<p>[London] The Inspector General of Chinese Maritime Customs, Merle Davis, arrived here today to serve as an advisor to the Chinese delegation attending the coronation of the King of England. He gave an interview to a Reuters reporter, saying that Chinese Customs has recently organized anti-smuggling teams on various railways and nearby roads in Tianjin, resulting in a large increase in the number of smuggled goods seized in Tianjin, and the trend of smuggling has been slightly curbed. However, the situation in the Jiidong area has not been tightly guarded. The position of the customs there, in terms of an effective anti-smuggling plan, has not improved. Unless China's sovereignty is effectively restored in areas where troops are not stationed and the customs anti-smuggling team can exercise its usual functions, the customs position there will not be improved. In other words, only after the maritime patrol boats and the land anti-smuggling team can restore their armament can the customs anti-smuggling functions be performed as usual. Japanese civil and some military officials have recently expressed their willingness to help Customs stop smuggling, and this sympathetic attitude will be beneficial. At the same time, local officials in Hebei Province are acting on orders from the central government and are now giving effective cooperation to the Customs anti-smuggling team, which is also strengthening the customs position. In terms of Chinese trade, there has been a general improvement in the past six months, and customs revenue has increased to an unprecedented level.

<h3>Governor-General of Taiwan Kobayashi Returns to Country for Duty</h3>

<h3>Japan's Soaring Prices Flood the Country</h3>
<p>Economic Lameness, Labor Unrest, Rural Anxiety, Whether the High Degree of National Defense Can Be Completed Is Doubtful</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The infighting between the Japanese government and the military and political parties is currently developing. The high tide of rising prices is flooding the country. The future change in the Tokyo political situation, that is, whether the military can complete the so-called high degree of national defense within the scheduled period, and whether it will exacerbate the resistance of the Japanese people at all levels, depends to some extent on how well the problem of rising prices is resolved. The Cabinet meeting today decided on the candidates for the Price Countermeasures Committee (Note: The establishment of the Price Committee is to control prices). In addition to the chairman of the committee, who is served by Prime Minister Hayashi, and the three vice-chairmen, who are served by Finance Minister Yuki and Goto and Yamazaki, there are also 15 committee members, 14 of whom are representatives of financial groups. Consumers are represented by only one person, Professor Yamazaki of Tokyo Imperial University. General observers express deep doubts about the effectiveness of this kind of institution using artificial forces to control prices. At the end of April, the Japanese retail prices increased by an average of 30% compared with the same period last year, and were higher than the total increase in the five years since the Manchurian Incident. The increase in steel prices last year was almost two or three times higher than the average increase. This terrible and dangerous phenomenon has caused the following direct consequences: (1) The budgets of the Army and Navy for this fiscal year prove to be insufficient to implement the original military expansion and replenishment plans. Therefore, in the next fiscal year, the military must demand a larger military expenditure in the new budget. Some people expect the total amount to exceed 3.2 billion yuan, which will further stimulate the soaring of general prices; (2) A vigorous expansion of the so-called "national defense production capacity" means thoroughly militarizing the national economy; (3) The completion of the organic organization of the national defense state, forced control of production and consumption, and therefore the establishment of the Planning Agency and the Price Countermeasures Committee, and the issuance of temporary imperial edicts to reduce steel import taxes, etc.; (4) Increase the exploitation of national labor, such as increasing working hours, intensifying working conditions, and imitating Germany to improve national labor service, etc. Whether the Hayashi cabinet can implement this work depends on the scope of the military's support for the current cabinet. However, the implementation of this policy will exacerbate the clash between the military and the financial groups attached to the military and the industrialists and commercial capitalists who support free competition. Most of this conflict is reflected in the existing political parties and the current struggle of the government. Coupled with the increasingly lower living standards of the majority of the people, the heat of labor disputes that the whole of Japan is worried about, and the deepening of rural unrest, all of these cannot be suppressed by any artificial countermeasures.

<h3>Deputy Envoy Chen to Visit British Naval Authorities</h3>
<p>Envoy Kong and Chen Entertain in England Every Evening</p>

<p>[London] The King and Queen, along with their two daughters, returned to London from Windsor Castle this afternoon, receiving the grandest welcome since their accession to the throne last December. Because the crowds filled the streets, the royal carriage had to take a detour, but police still found it difficult to clear the way. The royal carriage stopped several times en route due to vehicles and spectators becoming entangled. Crowds also gathered outside Buckingham Palace, awaiting the arrival of the royal carriage. When the royal carriage entered the palace, the crowds cheered for several minutes and were still unwilling to disperse. British Dominion troops guarded Buckingham Palace and St. James's Palace for the first time today.

<h3>Lively Scene in London Streets</h3>
<p>Striking Workers March with a Coffin; Shouting Slogans for Reduced Working Hours</p>
<p>[London] The central area of London is often sparsely populated and the streets are quiet on holidays. But today is different. As the King's coronation ceremony is approaching, flags and banners are hung on both sides of the streets, dazzling and eye-catching. Curious people from all over the city come to watch, bustling with activity and excitement. Although the weather is not good, with continuous rain since morning, the enthusiasm of the crowd has not diminished at all. Those who drive cars from major cities in other provinces to visit the capital are also constantly arriving, so that the stands along the road are too crowded, and they often sit for a few minutes and then leave. In order to maintain order, the police have increased the number of guards, more than two or three times as many as usual, but they cannot control the actions of the crowd. Sometimes the sidewalks are crowded, and the police can do nothing about those who walk outside the sidewalks. In addition, the rain made the roads slippery, and the number of people taking taxis increased sharply. The vehicles on the street were endless, often only able to move a few feet before having to stop, and there was no more of the speed of the wind. In the afternoon, thousands of striking bus drivers marched in teams, holding flags with slogans such as "Drivers reduce working hours, the public can increase safety." At the front was a car carrying a coffin covered with a driver's uniform and cap, with the words "This person died at work, only 46 years old." The marching team was in good order and proceeded slowly. When they reached Trafalgar Square, several people gave speeches to the crowd, all advocating for the interests of labor and not stopping until their goals were achieved. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] As the coronation ceremony of King George VI is approaching, the arrangement work along the route taken by the honor guard on that day is about to be completed. Flagpoles stand tall along the road, soaring into the sky, topped with huge crowns and covered with small flags. Some are decorated in the shape of shields, adorned with鲜flowers, and some are decorated with the initials GE of the King and Queen's names, colorful, gorgeous and beautiful. This is in sharp contrast to the smog-filled and dim scenes of London streets on weekdays. The sidewalks along the road are the location of the stands, which are also covered with fresh flowers. The exteriors of large public and private buildings in the Trafalgar Square area are also competing for novelty and brilliance. In the "Whitehall" area where government offices are located, flags are fluttering, and the balconies outside the windows are decorated with fresh flowers. A huge stand has been built in Parliament Square, and the honor guard will proceed along the Victoria Embankment from here. There are two ships docked in the river there, and stands have also been built on them. There are also stands on the opposite bank, but they have not yet been completed. From here, the honor guard will proceed along Northumberland Avenue, where the decoration is more simple. From here to Pall Mall, passing in front of the Pall Mall Club, the arrangement there is very rich and beautiful. From here to St. James's Street, because it is the location of St. James's Palace, the arrangement is even more pleasing to the eye. Then to Piccadilly Street, the color is even more bright. From here, the honor guard will proceed along Oxford Street to Hyde Park. Stands have also been set up on the green lawns in the park. Passing through Park Corner under the archway, through Queen's Park, you will reach Buckingham Palace, where tall flagpoles have been erected and the stands on both sides are incredibly high. Observing the various situations mentioned above, the grand occasion on the day of the coronation will definitely be unprecedented. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>

Among them, the Argentine battleship "Moreno" is the largest, with a displacement of 28,000 tons, and the Estonian submarine "Kalev" is the smallest, with a displacement of 600 tons. British warships will be divided into four types: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers, arranged in a row. Foreign warships will be interspersed among them. The King and Queen will travel back and forth on the yacht "Victoria and Albert" for the review. When the officers and soldiers of each ship see the royal yacht approaching, they will stand at attention and salute. According to the scheduled program, next to the flagship of the British Home Fleet "Nelson" (displacement 33,500 tons) will be the American battleship "New York" (built in 1914, displacement 27,000 tons). Opposite the British battleship "Rodney" (displacement 33,900 tons) will be the French battleship "Dunkerque" (displacement 26,500 tons, just completed last year, the fastest warship in the world). Next will be the Soviet battleship "Marat" (displacement 23,000 tons), the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" (displacement 10,000 tons, using an internal combustion engine), and the Japanese cruiser "Ashigara" (displacement 10,000 tons). Next will be the warships of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, and other countries. All British warships that participated in the European War will be in the front row to show their glory, including the battleships "Queen Elizabeth," "Barham," "Revenge," (all 31,000 tons) "Royal Sovereign," "Royal Oak," "Ramillies," "Resolution," (all 29,150 tons) and the world's largest battleship "Hood" (42,000 tons).

<h3>British Malaya Celebrates Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>[Singapore] Singapore spent more than 10,000 pounds on celebrating the coronation of the British King, so the whole island was illuminated with electric lights, flags were flying, and it was extremely lively. This morning, thousands of children of various ethnic groups watched movies for free. In the afternoon, they gathered in the square to listen to the broadcast of congratulatory messages to the British King. In the evening, tens of thousands of colored lights were lit up at the same time, which was especially spectacular. Although the streets of Singapore are wide, there are so many tourists that they still feel crowded. Not only Singapore is like this, but every place in Malaya is like this. Even remote villages on large islands off the coast have the same expression of loyalty to the British King. The Singapore government office is located in the center of the city and is on higher ground. The office is surrounded by millions of colored electric lights, with a large crown in the middle, with the words "George Ascends the Throne." At night, the sky is clear and the electric lights are all lit up. Looking at it from a distance, it is truly a different scene. Other places such as the European War Memorial Arch on the beach, the City Hall building, and the cathedral built by predecessors, emit light at night, presenting a solemn scene. Large and small ships in the harbor from all over the world are also flying flags during the day and burning lights at night. The most noticeable one is the warship "Terror," whose 15-inch caliber giant guns show the meaning of not forgetting danger in times of peace. All areas of the city are decorated, and each area has a archway to show congratulations. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>The King and Queen Visit the Coronation Ceremony Rehearsal</h3>
<p>[London] The King and Queen suddenly went to Westminster Abbey this afternoon to watch the coronation ceremony rehearsal. The King wore a felt hat, a black short coat, and striped trousers. The Queen wore a dove-gray loose-sleeved long coat and a wide-brimmed hat with a large red ribbon. The crowds outside the church cheered when they saw the royal carriage. The Queen smiled and waved to the crowd. The King's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent also arrived. At that time, the rehearsal of the honor guard was to the coronation platform ceremony. The Archbishop of Canterbury wore a purple and gold robe. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>A Short History of the King of England and His Family</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>King George VI of England was born on December 14, 1895, at Sandringham. He was the second son of George V, then the Duke of York, and Queen Mary, eighteen months younger than his older brother, Edward VIII. The education of English princes had long been a topic of meticulous study by the nation's prominent figures, yet unavoidable obstacles always remained. The Duke and Duchess of York advocated that their two sons' education should, as far as circumstances allowed, resemble that of the sons of wealthy families. King Edward VII, the boys' grandfather, having experienced the rigid German system of education, strongly agreed. It was deemed important to maintain the dignity of the royal family while also tempering any tendencies toward arrogance. Therefore, both sons, still young, were tutored by Mr. Hansell in preparation for the entrance exam to the Royal Naval College, and also studied French and singing. Every summer, the two boys would play cricket with other children of similar ages in Sandringham and Windsor. In winter, they switched to football, and in autumn, they fished by the water's edge or hiked in the mountains. Thus, the King's prowess in various sports during his adulthood was a direct result of his childhood training.</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen, the King and his brother entered the Osborne Naval College. Two years later, they both attended Dartmouth. The King studied harder than his brother, especially enjoying history, navigation, geography, and industrial geography, leaning toward the practical aspects of a sailor's life. In January 1913, at the age of eighteen, the King went on a cruise with the fleet, returning in June. This trip not only familiarized him with the fundamentals of navigation but also broadened his horizons as he traveled to the West Indies, Newfoundland, Canada, and other places. When the European War broke out, the King served as a midshipman on the cruiser "Collingwood." In May 1916, as a naval sub-lieutenant, he participated in the Battle of Jutland, manning the twelve-inch guns on the ship. He was commended in battle reports for his "calmness under fire." The British Navy was known for its egalitarian spirit, and during the heat of battle, the King prepared cocoa for his gunners, never behaving as if he were superior because of his noble birth. The soldiers, in turn, respected and loved him even more. Initially, the King suffered from appendicitis, undergoing surgery and resting for several months before returning to duty. However, he then suffered from boils due to overwork, and after a prolonged recovery, he heeded medical advice and gave up his life at sea. Since then, with proper care, his health had improved, and he had not suffered any serious illnesses in the last twenty years. In November 1917, he served in the Royal Naval Air Service. The following year, he was promoted to captain and received extensive aviation training, ready to contribute to the war effort, but just three weeks before being sent to the front lines, the armistice was signed. He then entered Brussels with the King of Belgium on November 22. This was the first triumphant moment in the King's life. After the peace was established, the King was assigned to the Air Department. Before long, he passed the sky and land examinations and obtained a Class A pilot's license. He was the first member of the royal family to fly an aircraft over London. In July 1920, he left the Air Department, but his name remained on the active officer list without pay. Previously, in the honors list announced by his father, the King had received the honorary title of Air Commodore, a token of appreciation for his interest in air force affairs.</p>
<p>During the European War, many young British men lost their education due to military service, and the King was one of them. Therefore, in October 1919, he and his brother Henry entered Cambridge University to continue their studies. The King studied history, economics, and civics. His time at university was quite short, and he did not attend classes regularly, but the time he spent there greatly benefited his future career. In the sixteen years between leaving university and ascending the throne, the King devoted himself to various public affairs, as busy as most people. He first served as the chairman of the Wembley British Empire Exhibition, which allowed him to interact with participants from all over the world and gain rich experience. The King was naturally shy and disliked being in front of large crowds, but he had to socialize with people from all walks of life, and his shyness gradually changed. During the years of the European War, laborers involved in war-related industries worked day and night, enduring great hardship. The experience gained from the munitions department proved that attention to workers' health and recreation could improve work efficiency and the well-being of the workers. Therefore, after the war, the Industrial Welfare Society was organized, with the King as its chairman. The aim of the society was to bridge the gap between labor and management and to ensure that the lower levels could communicate their needs to the upper levels. In the past, factories had few workers, and the factory owners could know each one individually. Now, factories often had hundreds or thousands of workers, and the factory owners were separated from the workers. If the workers had hidden grievances, they had no way to express them, which hindered work efficiency and harmed the interests of the factory owners. Therefore, the establishment of the society was beneficial to both parties. At the beginning, both labor and management were suspicious, fearing that it had other purposes. However, it soon became clear that the society was effective, thanks to the King's encouragement and active involvement. As a result, the King came into contact with various aspects of industrial life and earned the title of "Industrial Prince." There have been members of the royal family who have been concerned with religion, charity, education, and various social activities, but never before has there been one as focused on industrial issues as the King.</p>
<p>The work of the Industrial Welfare Society led to the establishment of the youth camping program, held annually for nearly fifteen years. This initiative was based on the principle that "all mankind are brothers," and it provided an opportunity to realize this ideal. Each year, more than a hundred public schools each nominated one boy, and more than a hundred industrial organizations each nominated two boys, totaling about four hundred people, who lived in tents by the sea for two weeks. Without distinction of rank, they lived together, engaging in outdoor activities or sitting around talking. At the beginning, there was widespread doubt that aristocratic children would be unaccustomed to living with poor children, and that the poor children would be incompatible with the aristocratic children. However, after only a few days, the children from all social classes blended together like milk and water, with no class distinctions. All the children wore jerseys and shorts, were divided into groups, and elected leaders to practice self-government. This initiative helped to eliminate the boundaries between social classes and allowed children from different social backgrounds to connect emotionally. Before his marriage, the King would spend several days at the camp each year, and before ascending the throne, he still made a point of visiting the camp, where he would eat and play with the children without disrupting the daily routines of the camp. The children were only briefly uneasy when they saw the King, and then quickly returned to their normal excitement. The King's experience living with the children helped him understand the circumstances of ordinary children. The King often spoke of this, and the initiative is now extremely popular and is expected to continue indefinitely. The only difficulty is that the number of applicants is too large, and the organizers have difficulty choosing. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Tomorrow, Listen to the Central Radio Station's Broadcast of the Coronation Ceremony of the King of England</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 12th of this month, England will hold the coronation ceremony of the King of England. The Central Broadcasting Station will broadcast the coronation ceremony program broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) on that day. It is reported that the station originally planned to broadcast the entire program from 18:15 to 23:10, but the broadcasting time was too long and may affect other regular programs. Therefore, it has been changed to broadcast the three most important parts of the coronation ceremony: ㊀ 18:00 Report on the arrival of the King at Westminster Abbey for the ceremony; ㊁ 18:15 Report on the start of the coronation ceremony; ㊂ 20:15 Report on the completion of the coronation ceremony. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[London] When the coronation ceremony is held on May 12, Daventry will use six wireless microphones to broadcast all the actions and sounds of the ceremony. Today, it was learned that the program includes twelve consecutive hours of broadcasting so that people in Malaya and the Far East can hear it all. From 9:10 AM to 5:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time, Shanghai time is 5:10 PM to 1:00 AM), it will be broadcast to the Far East at a wavelength of 19.76 meters. From 5:20 PM to 7:10 PM (Shanghai time is 1:20 AM to 3:10 AM on May 13), it will be broadcast at a wavelength of 25.53 meters. The wavelengths for broadcasting to Malaya are slightly different. The first time is 22.93 and 16.86 meters, and the second time is 19.82 meters. (Central News Agency, Reuters)</p>
<p>More than 8,000 people will participate in this year's British coronation ceremony. The International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation's affiliated Standard Telephone and Telegraph Company has installed the latest invented microphones in Westminster Abbey, which can capture every word and sound of the coronation ceremony and transmit them to the audience. This is a record for coronation ceremonies. It has been found that this equipment is a major advancement in the field of public speaking and a great success in sound transmission technology. It is based on research and advancements made in previous installations. Installing microphones in Westminster Abbey is not easy due to the unique architecture, but it has been successfully achieved using the latest methods. The equipment installed this time uses five large amplifiers, each with 30 watts of power for sound transmission, and the sound is emitted from 120 speakers. These speakers will be installed behind curtains, decorations, and pillars, making them virtually undetectable. The equipment is very complete. At the same time, the British Broadcasting Corporation will use the same equipment to broadcast wirelessly to all parts of the world. Even the roads along the route of the procession will be equipped with loudspeakers, so that not only those invited to attend can hear the words spoken during the coronation, but also the common people along the route can hear everything from this unprecedented coronation ceremony, as if they were there in person.</p>

<h3>Frequent Japanese Military Exercises in North China</h3>
<p>Japanese troops gather in the Tianjin-Yushu area for combat exercises. Residents in the exercise areas have been notified to evacuate.</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Japanese troops stationed in North China seem to have entered the exercise season again in the past half-month. Japanese troops in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), Tongfeng, Jianqin, and other places have been holding field combat, seizure, and defense exercises. On May 9, which is considered the most painful day by our entire nation, the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin gathered more than 1,000 soldiers from the Haiguang Temple and Limingzhuang battalions at the Limingzhuang barracks in the eastern suburbs of Tianjin. They occupied the area around the Huitong Company airfield for a large-scale review. At the same time, they celebrated the first anniversary of the establishment of the Limingzhuang soldiers' camp. The commander of the Japanese troops, Tashiro, led all his staff to personally review the troops. Special forces conducted drills with chemical warfare equipment such as poison gas and smoke bombs near the Huitong airfield. The exercises began in the morning and lasted until late in the evening. Also, on the 10th and 11th, from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, field exercises were conducted by infantry and artillery troops in the Dayibzhuang and Sunzhuangzi areas in the southern and western suburbs of Tianjin. About three or more battalions participated, along with an engineering vehicle team of about 400 people. The commander of the First Infantry Regiment, Kayashima, served as the reviewing officer. Senior staff from the headquarters were temporarily assigned to the attacking and defending teams. The exercise area was relatively large, so the Tianjin Municipal Government was notified in advance to inform the villagers to evacuate at the time to avoid misunderstandings. However, it is now the season for spring crops to sprout and grow in the fields. The Japanese military exercise areas are mostly farmland. The villagers in the towns and villages are worried that they will be trampled and suffer losses. On the 9th, representatives from dozens of villages such as Dayibzhuang came to Tianjin to petition the authorities, requesting them to negotiate with the Japanese to move the exercise elsewhere. However, the authorities said that the date of the Japanese military exercises was too close, and they were probably unable to do anything about it. They could only be comforted by the representatives. In addition to the troops participating in the exercises, there were also about 400 infantry and artillery soldiers who boarded a special train of the Beining Railway at 8:20 PM on the 9th and headed for Shanhaiguan. Starting on the 12th, they will link up with the Japanese troops in the Yushu and Qin areas to conduct exercises near the Shihe River for two days, followed by camping. This is a remote echo of the Tianjin Jiu incident. (Night of the 9th)</p>
<h3>Action of Ueda, Commander of the Japanese Guandong Army, in Northern Chahar</h3>
<p>Summoning puppet troops' conferences to instruct on westward invasion, re-employing bandit leaders such as Wang and Liu to expand three major teams.</p>
<p>Zhangbei Communication: On the 27th of last month, Member Zeng, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, Song Zheyuan, visited Chahar from Ping to inspect everything. Therefore, the sound of recovering the two counties in northern Chahar suddenly spread throughout the cold regions. The puppet army, because of the direct and personal relationship, paid special attention to the sound, such as strengthening vigilance everywhere. A loud banner was set up in Zhangbei. At night, the soldiers on duty did not leave their guns, and the horses did not remove their saddles. All the actions were aimed at the sound. Under the facts, the residents inside and outside the mouth are worried and afraid, thinking that the war is at hand. After Song returned to Ping, Ueda, the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, quietly arrived in Chengde, and then went to northern Chahar to give instructions, so the situation in northern Chahar was very tense for a while. However, in fact, except for the small stocks of about 20 to 30 puppet troops on the eastern border of Sui, there was no movement. As for Ueda's whereabouts, he and more than 10 senior staff members such as Watanabe entered Chahar from Chengde on the 4th of this month. The car stopped at Doron. On the 5th, he rested for a day, and on the 6th, he went from Doron to Baoyuan (the name after the merger of Baochang and Guyuan counties, the county seat is located in Baochang) to review the puppet troops and give speeches. He returned to Doron that night and decided to go to Zhangbei and then Huade within a few days. It is also said that Ueda Xing and Watanabe arrived at Jiabusi early on the 68th, and summoned a conference of the puppet Mongolian military and political leaders that night. On the morning of the 7th, they flew back to Chengde by military plane, and Bao Yueqing went with them. As for the content of the meeting, it was said that there was a detailed discussion and instruction on the opportunity to invade the west. In addition to inspecting the situation of the puppet army and instructing the opportunity to invade the west, Ueda's mission was also said to be to mediate the feud between De Wang and Li Shouxin, and to decide on the re-employment of Wang Ying and Liu Guitang. As for the time when the puppet army will invade the west, there is no definite news yet. After Wang Ying and Zhang Wanqing received economic assistance from a certain party, they actively conducted activities in the eastern Hebei war zone and Rehe Fengning Guidance Office. It is said that they have gathered 3,000 people and are concentrating on Guyuan. Liu Guitang is also gathering old troops in the Fengning area. There are now more than 1,700 people. On the 7th of this month, about 300 of their advance troops have arrived in Nanhoucha, and the rest of the troops are continuing to set off. It is also rumored that a certain party has announced the expansion of three major teams, the first major team is Wang Ying, the second major team is Zhang Haipeng, and the third major team is Liu Guitang. Although there are rumors about the entry of a certain party's regular army into Chahar and the supply of heavy weapons, aircraft, and tanks, there is no factual proof. (8th)</p>
<h3>Collision of Yuehan Railway Trains Near Juntian Station</h3>
<p>Locomotives and passenger and freight cars were destroyed. Dozens of track workers were injured, and one died.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, at about dusk, a train crash occurred near Juntian Station on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, injuring two or thirty track workers on the train. One of them has died from his injuries, and the firefighters in the other locomotive were also seriously injured. According to news from the railway office here, on the afternoon of the 4th, a 202 passenger train carrying hundreds of highway construction workers from the South Main Highway was pulled north by locomotive No. 117. After passing Letong Station, at 7:25 PM, as it was about to reach the No. 338 milestone at Juntian Station, locomotive No. 118, which was heading south from the north with a freight car carrying rice, came speeding. The area was on a slope, and although the southbound train was traveling slowly, it was coming down a steep slope and its momentum was great. It collided with the northbound locomotive No. 117, and the sound shook the valley. Both locomotives derailed at the same time and overturned onto the road. In addition, three southbound freight cars and several northbound carriages were also overturned off the tracks. More than ten northbound track workers were slightly injured, and more than ten were seriously injured. When locomotive No. 117 overturned, two firemen in the locomotive, Luo Song and Long, jumped from the train to the side of the road when the danger occurred. Long was injured in the chest, and Luo was injured in the head and had a broken arm. In addition, a track worker who was riding on the train had his head smashed open. The injured were sent back to Jiangcun Hospital for treatment. The worker who was injured in the head died upon admission to the hospital. A small number of other track workers were sent to the provincial hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the Yuehan Railway Southern Section Office immediately dispatched the chief of the Fifth Transport Section, Cheng Yaonan, the deputy chief of the section, Zeng Shuyue, the engineer Lu Jingqing, and the deputy director Wang Rengeng to the scene of the accident to investigate and handle the aftermath. However, because the locomotives and passenger and freight cars that had been damaged in the collision were still lying across the road on the left, and several meters of tracks and sleepers were also destroyed, traffic was blocked. Therefore, on the 5th and 6th, the northbound and southbound passenger and freight cars were forced to return. The engineers then supervised the workers to build a detour near the accident site on the 5th to allow vehicles to pass. However, the 80th and 82nd passenger and freight mixed trains to Lechang were suspended for one day on the 6th. In the afternoon of the 6th, the detour was completed, and the second Zhengtong express train from Guangzhou to Wuchang started running as usual that evening. On the 7th, passenger and freight cars between Guangzhou and Lechang also operated as usual. After investigating the circumstances of the accident, the railway officials returned to the Guangzhou office of the bureau to report to the Guangzhou branch of the road traffic safety committee. In order to study the true cause of the accident, the parties concerned were summoned to a meeting on the morning of the 7th at 11:00 AM. Those present were Wang Renkang, Cheng Yaonan, Zeng Shuyue, Lu Jingqing, and the station chiefs of Juntian and Letong, as well as the two drivers involved in the accident. They discussed the cause of the accident in detail. It was also heard that this accident was related to the terrain as well as personnel. The slope between Juntian and Street has a distance of 0.05% (that is, one foot high per hundred meters). Because the slope is too steep, the southbound trains can slide straight down even if they are opened very slowly, so it is not surprising that they collided with the northbound trains. (May 7)</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Petition to trial horse-drawn carriages</p>
<p>The streets here are narrow. Since the north-south main road was widened by manpower, the east-west main road will also be opened. However, it is still inconvenient for cars to enter the city after the roads have been widened, and manpower is too slow. Wang Enguang and others are planning to organize a horse-drawn carriage company and request the government to allow them to put ten carriages on trial. The county government is considering it.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Rice boat robbed by pirates in the river</p>

The other day, they transported rice from Wuhu to Tangjiazhai, Nantong for sale, worth more than 1,900 yuan in legal tender, and paid 1,000 yuan first. Unexpectedly, they were robbed by pirates on the way, and they lost both their lives and property. They sailed empty downstream to the south beach of Shazhou. On the 8th, the fisherman Chen Baofu spotted them and found a way to detain them. He reported to the village chief and transferred them to the county government for handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Poor fish harvest in nine fields</p>
<p>The production of yellow croaker in the nine coastal fields of Tongshu this year has been affected by the cold weather and the output has decreased. Fishermen in Lvsi Qiongying and other places have also suffered losses due to typhoons on the ocean surface. According to the investigation, the fish production this year is 40% less than the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Fourth District detains chiefs for training</p>
<p>Liu Zhiqin, the Fourth District Director of Jiangsu, has already started training the chiefs this month. However, some of the chiefs have registered at the civil school but have not reported, and some have not registered at the civil school at all, which is close to evasion. The police have been dispatched to investigate and determine the names and addresses of each chief and send them to the civil school for training.</p>
<p>Reassess official property to increase rent</p>
<p>The official property of Jiangdu has been leased out by the Official Property Bureau for many years without being reorganized.

<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Building a highway between Xiang, Huai, and Lian</p>
<p>The transportation business of Xiangshuikou has been developing rapidly in recent years. There are large ships on the waterway that can directly reach Shanghai and other places, and there are long-distance buses on the land route that can go to Donglai, Fuyan and other places. However, the southwest Huai and Lian counties are hundreds of miles away from Xiangshuikou, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. The Lianyungang Long-distance Bus Company plans to repair the section of road to facilitate transportation and benefit merchants.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Hotel owner arrested</p>
<p>Sun Yaofu, the owner of the Dongmen Nanhu Hotel, is from Zhuji and has lived here for many years. Because he is economically well-off, he also operates Hongxing Cattle Farm, Transportation Company, Civilian Entertainment Center, and Tea House in Gaojiawan at the same time. On the morning of the 9th, Sun was suddenly arrested by personnel sent by the Jiaxing District Security Command and detained for trial. It is said that this was handled by the command in accordance with a provincial telegram because he was suspected of a certain case. His family is currently questioning the case and requesting bail. The merchants in the Dongmen and Gaojiashu areas will also jointly submit a petition to bail Sun.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Various legal entities continue to request tax reduction</p>
<p>Jiashan's tax policy is the most additional tax in the province, with taxes being repeatedly increased, almost exceeding one and a half times the normal tax. At this time of frequent disasters, the people's burden is unbearable. Last month, the Land Administration Department had presented the real situation of the heavy tax in the county and the plan to correct the grain tax after the Qingzhang to the people's finance departments. Afterwards, the finance department approved the order, saying that the special construction donation was about to be abolished, and the amount requested was not much different, so it seemed difficult to approve. It is reported that the County Chamber of Commerce, Home Association, Education Association, and Women's Association continue to appeal for a reduction in taxes.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>

Zhao was shot in the leg and captured immediately. Two wooden-cased guns were embroidered and sent to the county government for handling at 4:00 PM on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Yunnan-Sichuan Journey (11)</h3>
<p>— Bai Juan</p>
<p>The twelfth day (April 27th): Departing from Anshun Prefecture, passing through Zhenning County, we arrived at Huangguoshu [Yellow Fruit Tree]. The Huangguoshu Waterfall is famous far and wide. Upon arrival, we saw a cliff more than ten zhang [~33 meters] high overlooking a deep abyss. The waterfall's water flowed down, but due to the prolonged drought, it wasn't very large. Initially, the public thought it could be used as "power," but after seeing it today, we realized that besides being admired as "scenery," there was no other hope. In the Guizhou dialect, "Mandarin orange" is called "Huang Guo." The area produces Mandarin oranges, hence the name. West of Huangguoshu, the terrain gradually rises, forming "Guansuo Ridge," with an elevation of 1,440 meters. Descending in multiple switchbacks, we reached Panjiang [Pan River] after more than ten turns. It is said that Guansuo Ridge was where Zhuge Liang [also known as Kongming] got lost while pacifying the barbarians. It was also the place where the former Governor of Guizhou, Zhou Xicheng, lost his life in internal warfare. Below is a "Ba Ling Bridge," which commemorates Zhou. The Panjiang River is shallow enough to wade across, but vehicles must slowly pass over the iron chain bridge. The bridge is a hundred chi [~33 meters] long and divided into two sections, supported by a stone wall in the middle. The five large characters "Panjiang Iron Chain Bridge" are engraved on the rock, written by Zeng Yangfu. Our vehicles unloaded their cargo and transported it across the bridge. The empty vehicles slowly crossed the iron chains one after another. When it came to the thirteenth charcoal vehicle, due to insufficient power and not driving fast enough, and because the lubricating oil was depleted, the steam pipe suddenly cracked. In the end, this vehicle had to stop there for repairs. The remaining vehicles continued forward, passing through Liangshuiying [Cool Water Camp] and arriving at Hama Village. The high ground was all above 1,500 meters above sea level. During the construction of this section the year before last, more than two thousand workers died. The engineer, Mr. Lin, also died there. Today, our group offered flowers at his grave to pay our respects. When we passed Guansuo Ridge, several vehicles rolled back tens of zhang while trying to ascend. The head of the group, along with the other gentlemen and members, all got out of the vehicles to push them. The inch-thick mud was slippery, and everyone became covered in mud. The successful progress of the journey was due to the combined efforts of everyone. Continuing on to An'nan County, An'nan has a history of leprosy transmission. The residents have a three-character mnemonic: "Don't rush early," "Don't eat fully," "Don't wash in the cold," "Don't take off your coat." In reality, the area is mountainous and lacks water. People collect muddy water from ditches several li away to drink, which easily leads to incurable diseases. Today, it happened to be rainy, so everyone used the inch-deep water as drinking water, hopefully free of germs. As soon as we arrived in An'nan County, someone reported that a foreigner was driving a car from Guiyang, following our group, and had now also arrived. Nie Shiwei and Qun Xiu, who know English from the Central Daily News, went to inquire. He claimed to be British, currently a reporter for the North China Daily News stationed in Beijing, with the Chinese name Lü Yisen. Some members of the group considered Guizhou as a bandit area and foreigners were not allowed to tour there. Furthermore, before our group set off, foreign reporters had requested to join, but were all politely declined. Now, this Englishman was tailing our group, which was suspicious. Fu Shanwu asked him if he had a passport. He said he had a military council and traveling permit from the provincial government. He was told that foreigners were not allowed to travel in this area, and if anything happened, the local authorities could not be held responsible. He replied that he would leave for Pan County that night, but he did not leave that night. The local government then sent a receptionist, Mr. She, to ask him to show his passport, which proved that Mr. Lü Yisen had come from Hunan to Guangxi, passing through Guizhou to Yunnan. The next morning, Mr. Lü left before our group, completing his journey through Guizhou and Yunnan. This showed the Englishman's interest in this road. Moreover, An'nan County has a Catholic church, and French priests frequently travel between Yunnan and Guizhou. The local residents are accustomed to seeing foreigners, but seeing a touring group of so many people was their first time, so they found it quite rare. An'nan County has antimony deposits, which can be mined to a limited extent. Among the mineable minerals in western Guizhou, only this antimony ore is currently known. In addition, although coalfields are visible everywhere, the coal seams are very thin, so the locals can only dig it from the mountains for fuel. It was also heard that the British military officers Hao Yejin and his wife, and Major Packe and his wife, had departed from Danchi and were traveling separately to Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. They had already arrived in Guangxi and would arrive in Guiyang in a few days, taking the same route as us to enter Yunnan. The British interest in this road is so strong. Western Guizhou has high mountains, composed entirely of limestone. There is more steam than red sandstone, so it is perpetually shrouded in clouds and mist, making it difficult to see the true face of the mountains. These are known as the "Cloud Ridge" mountains. The physique of the people of Guizhou, exposed to this harsh climate, lacks sunlight and is undernourished, resulting in an unusually dry complexion, not solely due to opium poisoning.</p>
<p>The twenty-fourth day (April 28th): Departing from An'nan, we descended from the mountains in twenty-four turns, passing through Jiangxipo, Bajiao Ridge, and Puan County, arriving at Jiufeng Temple. The terrain suddenly rises, with a barometer reading of 1,700 meters. The area around Jiufeng Temple has a long-standing reputation for malaria. Thousands of road workers died there each year, infected by mosquitoes. Our group did not stay long, and passing through Banqiao, we arrived in Pan County, the hometown of Wang Shufang, a member of the Central Committee. His younger brother, who lives there, also joined in welcoming us and helping our group. The former residence of Zhang Daofan, another member of the Central Committee, is also in these mountains. When the tour was being planned, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces competed for the dining stations. Guizhou proposed Pan County, while Yunnan proposed Pingyi, determining the location of future large and small stations. As a result, Pan County was designated as a tea station, providing refreshments, while Pingyi County was designated as a dining station. Traveling further west, the high mountains reached 2,100 meters above sea level. Passing Yizikong, we reached the place where Li Ciwen, a member of the Central Committee, was injured when his plane crashed. Upon inspection, the mountainous areas from Pan County to this point have all been cultivated, some even up to the mountain tops. However, the soil is barren and there is little grazing land, demonstrating the diligence of the people who have made the most of the land and its resources. Along the way in western Guizhou, there were wild roses in the mountains. They are abundant in Shanghai, but regrettably inedible. Passing through Pingyisuo from Yizikong (Pingyisuo belongs to Guizhou province), we arrived at Xiaojiezi, the scenic Shengguan Pass on the border between Guizhou and Yunnan. Within Guizhou, the land is entirely limestone, while entering Yunnan, it becomes red sandstone, clearly delineating the two mountain ranges. After entering Shengguan Pass, the weather cleared up. We had not seen the sun for more than ten days in Guizhou. Looking back at the top of the Cloud Ridge mountains, it was still covered in dense clouds. How vastly different is the natural fortune of the people of Guizhou and Yunnan! The roads in Yunnan are flat and well-maintained, with white lines marking pedestrian lanes on both sides, smoother than the Beijing-Tanggu road. The Yunnan roads were initially managed by Jian Ying, but later a provincial road bureau was established to handle these matters. Qian Jiejun, a member of the group, had previously been in charge of the road construction. Everyone expressed their respect for Mr. Qian, the son of Zhang Weihan, a member of the Legislative Yuan, who has an established reputation. Today, the group personally verified this. We arrived at Pingyi County at Shen hour [3-5 PM]. The fields and farms appeared slightly arid, and grazing land was scarce. The Yunnan provincial government set up a pine and cypress cafeteria outside Pingyi, with pine needles as the floor covering, wisteria vines draped on the pillars, and walls made of lush green leaves. Entering it, the aroma was refreshing, clearly requiring considerable thought. The food was also exquisite, which particularly pleased the Yingdun group. Pingyi is the poorest county town in Yunnan. In the center is a bell tower, from which one can view the north pass. The public reading room has several newspapers from Kunming and Shanghai. The Pingyi area, at 1,900 meters above sea level, is a plateau. The soil is similar to that north of the Yellow River. The climate is dry. As evening fell, we passed through Zhan Yi County, with thousands of lights illuminated. People from all walks of life came out to welcome us, standing in neat rows for half a li.</p>

<h3>Deputy Mayor Yu Issues Important Statement on Cross-Border Road Construction Case</h3>
<p>The Policy of Safeguarding Sovereignty while Considering Facts Will Not Change; We Would Rather Wait for the Other Party to Realize if They Disregard Our National Sovereignty.</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor Yu yesterday issued an important statement regarding the "Cross-Border Road Construction Negotiation" case as follows:</p>
<p>The only basis for the Public Works Department's construction of roads outside the concession boundaries is the Yangjingbang [Soochow Creek] Regulations. However, these regulations clearly stipulate that the purpose of constructing such roads is limited to use for parks and public sports and recreation grounds. Moreover, cross-border road construction is one thing, while exercising police power and collecting taxes on cross-border roads is another. The legal basis for cross-border road construction is already weak, and exercising police power and collecting taxes on cross-border roads has absolutely no legal basis. The Municipal Government, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, has no choice but to raise negotiations based on law and reason. For several years, adopting an attitude of minimizing conflict and seeking peace, we have pursued a peaceful resolution, hoping to reach a reasonable temporary solution within the scope of considering both law, reason, and facts. The Public Works Department itself is also aware of its position, so during the negotiations between the two sides, they have been quite sincere. However, because the Japanese side's expectations were too high, and due to the emergence of minor issues, the cross-border road construction issue could not be resolved, which is truly regrettable. Recently, the informal proposals made by the Japanese side to our side are currently under consideration. However, the Municipal Government's negotiation partner is the Public Works Department, and the Japanese side's opinions are only for our reference. The Municipal Government's policy of "safeguarding sovereignty while considering facts" regarding cross-border road construction will not change. The Municipal Government sincerely hopes to adopt the reasonable opinions of the Japanese side and other relevant parties as much as possible to promote the resolution of this case. However, if there are those who only know about their own partial interests and disregard our national sovereignty, then the resolution can wait for another day, until public justice is revealed and the other party realizes. As for the recent rumors of "resolving by district," "51% of taxes going to the Chinese side and 49% to the Public Works Department," and "the Japanese side planning to establish a Japanese concession in Hongkou," these are all untrue and should not be believed.</p>
<h3>Xirao Jiacuo Discusses Hope for Communication Between Han and Tibetans</h3>
<p>Both Sides Must Recognize the Facts and Improve Han-Tibetan Relations.</p>
<p>The Tibetan Great Geshe Xirao Jiacuo, at the invitation of various Buddhist organizations in the city, came to teach Buddhist scriptures. He arrived in Shanghai on the 9th, accompanied by his secretary and Gao Guanru. Reporters from the Zhuojin Buddhist Pure Land Society and the Xin Xin News Agency paid a special visit yesterday morning. According to him, he was invited by the central government to teach in the Central Plains and was deeply honored by the warm reception from all sectors. He was very excited to see the various constructions and cultural and educational developments in Beijing, which all have a new atmosphere. In addition to teaching, he also hopes to promote communication between Han and Tibetans and improve Han-Tibetan relations. However, both sides must recognize the facts, work together, and strive for mutual affection and goodwill. He especially hopes that the central government will take the initiative to support Tibetan culture and education, politics, society, and economic construction. He can also use the religious beliefs of Tibetans to connect with each other because religious faith has become an ironclad reality for Tibetans, which goes without saying. As for the Panchen Lama returning to Tibet, it is of course a matter of course because the master is the leader of Tibet, and everyone hopes that he will return to Tibet to preside over various affairs in Tibet. He plans to stay in Shanghai for about a week and then go to Beijing to teach. In the summer, due to the hot climate in the south, he may have to go to Beiping to escape the heat and teach at Peking University and Tsinghua University. It is also understood that Master Xirao attended a banquet hosted by various Buddhist organizations at noon yesterday. At 3:30 PM, he ascended the altar to teach the scriptures. People from all walks of life who went to listen were very enthusiastic. It is reported that after the lecture is completed, Master Xirao plans to go to Ningbo to visit famous mountains such as Putuo, Tiantai, Yuwang, and Tiantong to worship Buddha.</p>

<h3>City Party Headquarters Held a Memorial Meeting Yesterday for the First Anniversary of Hu Zhantang's Death</h3>
<p>Chairman Cai Hongtian Reported the Significance of the Memorial; All Agencies and Organizations Lowered Flags to Mourn</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters of this city convened representatives from all sectors at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 10th) in the auditorium of the headquarters to hold a memorial meeting for the first anniversary of Mr. Hu Hanmin's death. (Originally, it was to be held in the next two days, but it was brought forward due to the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor). An order was issued to all agencies, organizations, schools, party headquarters at all levels, and households in the city to lower the national flag for one day on Sunday to express mourning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue was set in the auditorium of the City Party Headquarters. The Party's national flag and a white cloth banner were hung in front of the door, with the words "Shanghai Celebrities Hold a Memorial Meeting for Mr. Hu Zhanchang's Death." The Party's national flag and a portrait of the Prime Minister were also hung in the center of the auditorium. Order slogans were pasted on both sides, and the four walls were covered with slogans. The arrangement was solemn and respectful.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Qiu Hongzao from the Local Court, Li Yanqu from the Prosecutor's Office, Ju Zhaoding from the Maritime Administration Bureau, Lu Muqin from the General Labor Union, Lin Ketin from the Women's Association, Cao Zhigong from the Municipal Assembly, Lu Yin from the Labor Association, Huang Xianggu from the French Concession Taxpayers Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Business Promotion Association, Yu Yaoqiu from the First Special District Citizens Joint Association, Gong Jingyan from the Second Special District Citizens Joint Association, Zhu Shide from the National Goods Maintenance Association, Zhang Sheng from the Farmers and Workers Life Improvement Society, Gan Jinqi from the Press Reporters Friendship Association, Liu Zhongying from the National Manufacturers Association, Huang Kegui from the Municipal Education Association, Zhang Yi'ao from the Moral Education Association, Wu Guofang from the Wharf Business Office, Dai Yongchan from the Jiangsu Fellow Villagers Association, Li Weixiong from the Juvenile Propaganda Group, Zhang Xiaotong from the Songjiang Homecoming Association, Zhao Zhenling from the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Lao Jianshao from Chih Chih College, and more than 300 representatives from various agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters at all levels.</p>
<p>Meeting Minutes</p>
<p>⑴ All stand in silence, ⑵ Sing the Party song, ⑶ Bow three times to the Party's national flag and the manager's portrait, ⑷ Silent tribute for three minutes, ⑸ Chairman's report, ⑹ Speech, ⑺ Shout slogans, and then the meeting adjourned. After the salute, Chairman Cai Hongtian first gave a report, roughly stating that today is the Prime Minister's Memorial Week, and at the same time, it is the first anniversary of Mr. Hu Zhantang's death. Mr. Hu passed away in Guangdong on May 12 last year. Because the day after tomorrow is the coronation ceremony of the British King, the central government stipulated that today will be combined with the Prime Minister's Memorial Week. It is even more meaningful to commemorate Mr. Hu today. The Prime Minister's Memorial Week is usually held to commemorate the Prime Minister's greatness and study and implement his doctrines. It requires us to complete the Prime Minister's teachings and continue to work hard. Mr. Hu has the most faith in and the most diligent implementation of the Three Principles of the People created by the Prime Minister. Mr. Hu is a great man in our Party. Generally, a person who has made special contributions to the nation and the country, who can establish words, establish virtue, and establish achievements, will surely be admired by future generations. Mr. Hu can be said to have combined all of these. Therefore, people inside and outside the Party admire him. In terms of establishing words, in the early revolutionary period, he worked hard to develop revolutionary theories, and later expounded the Prime Minister's teachings and instructed the direction of implementation. In terms of establishing virtue, Mr. Hu never liked beautiful women and was absolutely responsible for everything, without any sloppiness. Whether it was public or private morality, he was a model for young people. In terms of establishing achievements, he was loyal to the Prime Minister and always believed in his doctrine. He assisted the Prime Minister in creating the Republic of China. Therefore, Mr. Hu's life and words and deeds are indeed worthy of commemoration. Today's commemoration, in addition to the ceremony, also commemorates him in the spiritual aspect, learning from Mr. Hu. First, we must work hard in learning and cultivation. Second, we must cultivate morality and integrity. Third, we must always recognize Mr. Hu's dying will: only the Three Principles of the People can save China. Finally, we should strive to unite and resist insults and revive the nation, and so on.</p>
<p>Slogans</p>
<p>⑴ Learn from Mr. Hu's revolutionary spirit ⑵ Learn from Mr. Hu's integrity ⑶ Mr. Hu's spirit is immortal ⑷ Long live the Three Principles of the People ⑸ Long live the Kuomintang ⑹ Long live the Republic of China</p>
<p>Condolences from All Parties</p>
<p>In addition to sending representatives to participate in the memorial meeting of the City Party Headquarters, all agencies, organizations, schools, party headquarters at all levels, and households in this city lowered their flags for one day to express their condolences. The Special Party Headquarters of the Chinese Seafarers convened various seafarers' organizations yesterday to hold a memorial meeting, led by Yang Hu, the special commissioner of the headquarters. The Special Party Headquarters of the Jinghu, Huhangyong Railway also held a conference to express their commemoration.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Initiates a Campaign to Promote Not Selling Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Manufacturers Association of this city believes that the proliferation of smuggled goods is enough to endanger the national economy, and the smuggled goods in this city have also been rampant recently. To investigate the reason, there must be unscrupulous merchants who are blinded by profit and act as accomplices. Therefore, if we want to eradicate smuggled goods, it is essential for the customs to step up anti-smuggling efforts, and it is even more fundamental to stimulate the patriotic thinking of merchants and citizens and refuse to buy and sell smuggled goods. Therefore, it specially launched a campaign not to sell smuggled goods to remedy this. In order to promote the implementation, it also sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, trade associations, the Municipal Farmers Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, local associations, the Municipal Women's Association, various national goods organizations, and the Citizens United Associations of various districts, requesting them to jointly promote this. The association also plans to hold a general meeting for the campaign not to sell smuggled goods on a regular basis to expand publicity and awaken the attention of merchants and citizens.</p>

<h3>All Circles in this City Organize a Sichuan Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>▲Zhang Qun Reported on the Disaster Situation Yesterday ▲Elected Standing Committee to Plan and Proceed</p>
<p>The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association in this city held a tea party for leaders from all walks of life at the Bank Club at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the actual situation of the Sichuan disaster and raise relief funds. More than 100 people attended. Zhang Qun, Xu Kan, Yang Shukan, Wu Dingchang, Lü Chao, Xiang Fuyi, Xie Chi, and Dai Fuxian were publicly elected as the presidium. After the etiquette was completed, Chairman Zhang Qun first reported on the disaster situation, saying that Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance" and has never experienced disasters. Unexpectedly, disaster news has been heard from time to time in the past three years. As of this year, the disaster situation has become more serious. According to investigations, the disaster area in Sichuan Province covers 147 counties, about 800,000 square miles, and there are more than 35 million victims. The Sichuan-Chongqing highway, known as the richest area, has already had more than 5,000 people who died of starvation due to the disaster this year. This kind of tragic situation cannot be described in detail, which led to the strong taking risks and the weak filling the ditches. Although the Sichuan Provincial Government has raised 2 million yuan to handle emergency relief, it is a drop in the bucket. The issue of the government issuing bonds, its fund problem, has not been decided. In this crisis, we have to find other ways to raise more money. I think the gentlemen present today are all leaders from all walks of life, and you are kind-hearted. You should be sympathetic to the relief of the Sichuan disaster. Please express your great opinions and plan good strategies, so that a call to the heights will be echoed by all the mountains. This is not only the fortune of the victims, but also the blessing of the country and society. Subsequently, Wu Dingjing, Yang Shukan, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu and others expressed their opinions one after another. Finally, it was decided to organize the Shanghai All Circles Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, and it was decided that Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Wu Dingchang, Zou Lin, Lü Chao, Xu Kan, Yang Shukan, Xie Chi, Xiong Kewu, Huang Fusheng, and Xiang Fuyi. In addition to the eleven people as ex officio members, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Song Hanzhang, Yu Zuoting, Xu Xinliu, Qu Wenliu, Mu Ouchu, Wang Boqi, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Guo Shun were also added as members. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 PM. After the meeting, all the committee members continued to hold a talk meeting, exchanged opinions and decided to hold an inaugural meeting tomorrow (the 12th) to discuss specific relief measures.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Invites All Circles to Beg for Relief for the Guizhou Disaster</h3>
<p>This Afternoon at the International Hotel</p>
<p>The drought disaster in Guizhou is severe. Wang Chengying, the Director of the Provincial Department of Finance, and Committee Member He Jiwu, have come to Shanghai one after another to beg for relief. He Yingqin, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, is also for the drought in his hometown, and is scheduled to invite Shanghai philanthropists and financial circles to a tea party at the International Hotel at 4:00 PM today (the 11th). It is also heard that the Relief Joint Association in this city will also distribute donation appeals for the Guizhou drought disaster. Unfortunately, Guizhou has been plagued by successive disasters. Tracing back to the source of the disaster, it is actually a long drought. Guizhou is a barren area with thin soil and shallow water. Even occasional rain may already save the disaster situation. This time, since the rain on March 17, 1935, there has been no rain this year, with more than 62 counties affected out of 81 counties, and a total of 2,762,276 people affected. Based on the province's population of 9,199,514 people, it accounts for more than 30% of the province's population. This is something that has not been seen in recent years. The autumn harvest last year was already poor, and we were hoping that the spring harvest would make up for it. But the spring harvest was disappointing again, which led to today's strange famine. As for the land, the four villages are scorched, and the fields are cracked into turtle patterns. The ditches are full of salt, and the rivers and wells are dry, and drinking water is almost cut off. What was called a disaster in the past was nothing more than grain shortages and vegetable shortages, but now it is also reported as a water shortage. Alas, how can the people of Guizhou bear this? As for the people, food is scarce and prices are high, and life is becoming increasingly difficult. The rich are becoming poorer, and the poor are becoming refugees. Even thieves steal things regardless of the owner, and robbers are on the thoroughfare. The reason is that they have no choice. If relief is not sought urgently, or if it is feared that the hungry geese will take risks, the impact on public security is of great concern. As for the things, the grass roots have been dug up, the tree bark has been peeled off, and even chalk is taken to fill the stomach. Turbid water is used daily to quench thirst. What is even more painful is that the plows are hung high and the rural areas are bankrupt. In the east road in recent months, groups of hundreds of plows are commonly seen leaving the province one after another. Other roads are also similar. The average poor peasant is now feeling the failure of farming tools and is forced to sell the plows on which he relies for life because he has no capital for life. The pain is almost equal to that of exchanging children and splitting bones. Even if there is rain in the future, the farming tools will be gone. The desolation has reached this point, what can be said? The above is just a general outline, and there are countless other things that are unbearable to see and hear. Alas, Zheng Xia's picture of refugees may be difficult to depict this tragic scene, and Zhao Wen's distribution of food still awaits the future. In addition to the central government allocating funds for relief, considering that the disaster is deep and the disaster area is too large, it is still difficult to help with a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that the wise men in the country will make great efforts in this era, based on the plainness of hunger and drowning, and make a great effort to solve the problem. Either help with gold or quickly issue food. Accumulating sand at the bottom of the pagoda and collecting fur into robes, perhaps the benevolent and righteous grain will come from the sea and the river, and the precious water and rich mountains will always be remembered for the gift of the sky. Life and death are relatives, and the merits are boundless. This is what we are asking for the lives of millions of victims and praying for you. Sincerely,</p>

Yang Zhiping was formerly the manager of the Bank of China in Shenyang and provided much support to Du in the management of porcelain making in the Northeast. After the Kuang Ta Company was prepared two years ago, Du was imprisoned due to the New Life Movement, so all the affairs were entrusted to Yang to handle. Yang came from Shenyang to Jiangxi for planning, so all parties were deeply pleased to have him.</p>

<h3>Young Aviator Xu Qixing to Perform in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Mrs. Huang Jianliang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Sightseeing Trip to Beijing Rescheduled for the 13th — Aviation Construction Association Hosts Grand Banquet Last Night —</p>
<p>Young overseas Chinese aviators from Java, Mr. Xu Qixing and Mr. Chen Yi'an, after flying back to China for sightseeing and receiving a warm welcome from all sectors upon their arrival in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Mr. Xu's wife, Ms. Huang Jianliang, also arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday. Mr. Xu is scheduled to perform in Shanghai today and visit Beijing for sightseeing on the 13th, after which he will return to Shanghai and fly to Beiping, Tianjin, and other places for sightseeing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Aviation Construction Banquet</p>
<p>Ms. Huang Jianliang, wife of Xu Qixing, returned to China with her husband for sightseeing. However, because Mr. Xu's travel airplane can only accommodate two people, after Mr. Xu returned to China with Mr. Chen Yi'an the day before yesterday, Ms. Huang immediately took the Italian Postal Shipping Company's "Conte Biancamano" liner from Singapore to Shanghai. The liner originally sailed in the Atlantic Ocean and this voyage was her maiden voyage in the Pacific Ocean. She arrived at the port at 1:30 PM yesterday and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf on Broadway Road. Those who went to welcome her, in addition to Xu Qixing and Chen Yi'an, included more than a dozen people such as Zhang Yuliang from the Chinese Aviation Construction Association, Tan Zhonglu from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Mr. and Mrs. Ding Wushi. After Ms. Huang briefly socialized with the welcomers on the ship, she took a car to the Hua'an Hotel to rest. At 7 PM, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Aviation Construction Association hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Xu Qixing and Mr. Chen Yi'an at the International Hotel. During the banquet, Chairman Wang Xiaolai stood up and delivered a speech, stating that the government leads the aviation movement for the construction of national defense, while the private sector promotes it to seek the development of private aviation undertakings. Although aviation is a sharp weapon of war, we are quite willing to use it for commerce and transportation to gradually create world peace and prosperity. Mr. Xu's business in Java is very large, and he has started manufacturing airplanes for the convenience of transportation, which coincides with my own wishes. I have also heard that Mr. Xu's return to China this time was facilitated by his wife, and that he intends to work hard for the aviation industry of the motherland in the future. There will be no problem with the capital for establishing a factory. His ambition is very admirable, and the lady's contribution is also significant. I would like to raise a glass to wish Mr. and Mrs. Xu and Mr. Chen success. Lin Kanghou said in his speech that there are more and more Chinese people who can fly airplanes, but Mr. Xu should be the first person who can manufacture airplanes himself. He also hopes to realize his ambition to return to China to establish a factory for manufacturing. Colleagues should support his success with both spirit and material resources. Xu Qixing delivered a reply speech, stating that most people deeply believe that the air force will definitely determine the victory or defeat of land and sea battles in future wars, and that aviation is especially important to China. Because in terms of time and financial resources, China cannot afford to establish a huge navy, and China's land is vast, so marching will inevitably be slow. Therefore, aviation is a major plan to save the country. I deeply know that among our young people, there are quite a few who are willing to sacrifice for the country. The only problem at present is how to prevent this kind of talent from making meaningless sacrifices. If airplanes are used, the sacrifice of one person can sink a huge battleship of the enemy country. This is a good strategy for invaded countries to defeat the enemy. Chairman Mr. Wang Xiaolai stated in his speech today that airplanes should be used exclusively for civilian purposes in the future, rather than as tools for killing people. This is indeed the heartfelt cry of a great philanthropist. This one sentence alone is enough to be praised by future generations. It is a pity that this kind of ideal world has not yet arrived. The only thing that can coincide with Mr. Wang's words is that our Chinese air force will be used for self-defense and will never be used as a tool of aggression. We hope that China will quickly establish factories and manufacture the best airplanes. If necessary, we will train a suitable air force, and when there is no war crisis in the world, we will change it to civil aviation to seek the convenience and comfort of passengers and seek the economic development of the country. Regarding this plan, I am prepared to do my best. If the elders and folks in the country are willing to give me a helping hand, it will surely achieve greater results. I have already told you all. My coming here at least at this time is definitely not just for travel. Finally, I express my deep gratitude for the warm hospitality of tonight's banquet. Finally, Mr. Chen delivered a brief thank you speech, and the banquet ended happily at around 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu Talks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shenshi News met with Ms. Huang Jianliang on the ship yesterday. According to her, she was born in Nanyang. She returned to China to study in Beiping in her childhood. She felt greatly stimulated when the May 3rd Massacre occurred, so she went to a school run by another academic institution in Beiping. She returned to Nanyang in 1933. She married Mr. Xu the following year, 1934. Then the reporter asked about the rumor that the lady is also proficient in aviation technology. Ms. Huang smiled and replied that she herself has not learned aviation and therefore does not fly airplanes, but her two younger sisters are quite familiar with flying. Ms. Huang is short in stature and has the demeanor of a Nanyang person. She speaks fluent Mandarin and is 27 years old this year. Her joy at returning to her motherland this time is evident in her eyebrows.</p>
<p>Today's Performance</p>
<p>Since Mr. Xu and Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, their travel-style self-equipped airplane has been stored in the hangar of the China Aviation Company. Mr. Xu inspected it yesterday and found that all the internal parts were undamaged. It is now scheduled to perform at the Longhua Airport today to observe the Shanghai airspace and practice. It is now heard that the Nanjing Airport has not been repaired yet, and the original flight to Beijing on the 12th coincided with the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor, so it was changed to take a car to Beijing on the 13th to pay respect to the capital, and then return to Shanghai to fly to Beiping, Tianjin, and the northwest for sightseeing.</p>

<h3>Basketball Match Assault on Referee Case Opens</h3>
<p>Defendant Lin Jianxian Admits to Being of Dutch Nationality; Referee Wu Zibin Requests Court to Bring Him to Justice</p>
<p>Lin Jianxian, basketball player and team leader No. 4 of Datong High School, competed with Guanghua High School for the High School United Championship on April 20th in the Shenyuan Basketball Hall. Wu Zibin, a teacher from Dongya Sports College, served as the referee. As a result, a dispute arose over the ball, and the Datong basketball team beat Wu Zibin, causing him to be injured. Wu sued in the local court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Lide opened the court. Lin Jianxian testified that he was 21 years old, a Dutch Javanese, and lived in Datong University High School on Fan Gan Du. My ancestors have lived in the Netherlands for more than 40 years, and we have all become Dutch citizens. The issue of nationality should be under the jurisdiction of the Dutch consulate. The judge asked if there was any evidence of loss of nationality. He replied, no, there is none at present. The judge instructed him to testify according to the law. Lin then testified that he was basketball player No. 4 and captain of Datong High School. At 3 PM on April 20th, he competed with Guanghua High School for the High School United Championship in the Shenyuan Basketball Hall. Wu Zibin, a teacher from Dongya Sports College, served as the referee. In the second half, a dispute arose over the ball between our team's player No. 8 and Guanghua's player No. 3. According to the rules, Guanghua should be punished, but the referee was biased and punished us instead. Because I was the captain, I raised a question on behalf of the whole team. He scolded us instead, so someone twisted him. I never hit him at all, etc. Wu Zibin testified that he was 27 years old, from Suzhou, and a teacher at Dongya Sports College in Lujiagou. At 3 PM on April 20th, Datong High School competed with Guanghua High School in basketball. The High School Sports Federation invited me to be the referee. Because of the cycle of responsibility, I was the only referee. In the second half, I enforced my duties in accordance with the sports rules, so I punished Datong. Unexpectedly, that day, Guanghua won by six or seven points over Datong, so many students were led into the hall and surrounded me and beat my chest and other places. I vomited blood on the spot and was seriously injured. I am still being treated in the hospital and have not recovered. I cannot attend classes, so I ask that the law be brought to justice and attach a private lawsuit. The defendant's lawyer, Chen Tao, raised the issue of nationality again. The court discussed that the case was entirely a dispute of emotion. If someone came out to reconcile and apologize, wouldn't the lawsuit be settled? As for the issue of nationality raised by the defendant, two weeks were given to present evidence. However, because the defendant has raised the issue of nationality, there is a risk of fleeing abroad, so a bail of 500 yuan was specially paid to await rescheduling of the trial.</p>
<h3>Couple Touring the City God Temple Encounter Unexpected Disaster</h3>
<p>Bandits Attempt to Rob Gold Bracelet; Husband Dies, Wife Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 4 PM, a road robbery case that seemed to be a robbery occurred on Jiushi Road in the City God Temple in the southern city. At the time, the bandits fired four shots as a warning. A stray bullet hit a Mr. and Mrs. Mu who were touring the temple. The wife's injuries were very minor, while the husband, surnamed Yang, died less than an hour after being sent to the hospital due to a fatal injury. There were three robbers in total, all of whom escaped in the chaos. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Narrow Lane</p>
<p>There is a narrow lane in the City God Temple in the southern city called Jiushi Road. Although the road is not well-known, it is accessible in all directions and is actually one of the most important commercial districts in the City God Temple. There are rows of shops and many tourists. Yesterday happened to be the first day of the lunar April, and there were even more tourists than in the past. At around 4 PM, several shots rang out suddenly on Jiushi Road.</p>
<p>Lying on the Ground</p>
<p>At the sound of the gunshots, pedestrians fled in all directions, and the order was disrupted. As a result, a young man and woman were found lying in a pool of blood near the entrance of the Jinrenxing Huqin Shop nearby. Chief Yu of the Yimiao Police Station, who was in charge, immediately led a large number of officers to the scene, but the gunmen had long since disappeared. So they first sent the two injured men and women to Renji Hospital.</p>
<p>Couple Touring Together</p>
<p>The two injured men and women are actually husband and wife. The man's name is Yang Binggen, 25 years old, from Nanxiang. He used to work as a steward on a ship. His father runs a small restaurant at No. 10, B, on the Jin Shenfu Road. His wife, Xu, came to the City God Temple with him to play. The two walked into Jiushi Road and were planning to buy a wooden fish at the Jinrenxing Huqin Shop. However, before the deal was concluded, disaster struck.</p>
<p>Yang Binggen Dies</p>
<p>After the two were sent to the hospital, the doctor's examination showed that in addition to Xu's minor skin injury to her right calf, Yang Binggen was fatally wounded in the lower left abdomen, so he died less than an hour after arriving at the hospital. The hospital notified the police to send the body to the autopsy room on Linglun Road to await autopsy.</p>
<p>Attempt to Rob Gold Bracelet</p>
<p>As for how the case started, there are different opinions. Even the police station in charge was unable to obtain an accurate picture of the truth. Afterwards, only Yang Xu said that she and her husband, Yang Binggen, were walking in the middle of the road when they suddenly saw a fashionable woman in front of them followed by a suspicious man. She also saw that the man's eyes were closely watching the gold bracelet on the woman's arm. When they reached the front of the Huqin Shop, the man wanted to rush forward to grab it.</p>
<p>Circumstances</p>
<p>At this time, Binggen bravely stepped forward and hugged the man. Unexpectedly, there were two other accomplices beside him. Seeing that their companion was arrested, one of the bandits shot her husband. However, according to the investigation by the police station, it is true that the bandits attempted to rob a fashionable woman's gold bracelet, but it was not Yang Binggen who hugged the bandits, but someone else. However, it has not been discovered who it was.</p>

<h3>Country Girl Loses Job, Owes Room and Board Money; Scoundrel Plots to Abduct and Sell Her</h3>
<p>Boat Ticket to Qingdao Already Purchased; Fortunately, Female Companion Discovers and Reports to the Police, Cracking the Case</p>
<p>Zhang Fengzhu, a woman from Jiangbei, 19 years old, came to Shanghai from her hometown last winter and lived at No. 8, Shangde Lane, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. After losing her job in a silk factory, she often fell ill. Her money ran out, so she could not maintain her rent and expenses. She wanted to find a job but could not find one. At around 7 PM on March 9th of this year, while walking on Zhoushan Road, she met Zhang Youdao, a fellow villager, and told him about her situation. Zhang said that there was a fellow villager, Chen Yuli, who ran a steamed bun restaurant at No. 15 Huade Road, where she could stay temporarily. He would try to find her a job. So he took the woman there and agreed on a daily board and lodging fee of 40 cents. Between April 26th, the room and board money amounted to about 20 yuan. Chen returned to Zhang to ask for it, but could not cope. At the moment, a promissory note was made, and the woman went to the home of her friend Min Longhai at No. 46 Tangshan Road to discuss. She wanted to deceive the woman to Qingdao and sell her to a brothel to be a prostitute. She temporarily lived in Min's place. On the 30th, Min Longhai bought a Taikoo Wharf Hankou round trip ticket to Qingdao from Wang Shengji Travel Agency at No. 67 Gongguan Road in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Several tickets. At 7 AM the day before yesterday, Zhang Youdao gave the woman a boat ticket, saying that Min Longhai was now introducing her to work in a silk factory in Wuxi. All the clothes, etc., were prepared properly. The woman had a close friend, Zhou Zhu, a woman from Sichuan, who lived on Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei, and went to tell her about the situation. The woman noticed that the boat ticket was to Qingdao, not a train ticket to Wuxi at the North Railway Station. She knew that those people were tricking the woman into selling her to Qingdao, so she reported to the Huishan Police Station. Detective Liu Decheng was dispatched to investigate Min Longhai's home at No. 46 Tangshan Road with the woman, and it was true. Three Qingdao Hankou steamboat tickets were found. The people who were going to Qingdao together were Min Longhai and his father, Min Youcai (70 years old), and Zhang Youdao, a total of four people including the woman. Chen Yuli was also suspected of being an accomplice. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation and asked for an investigation. According to the woman Zhang Fengzhu and the Sichuan woman Zhou Zhu, it was confirmed that Detective Liu presented the four boat tickets to Qingdao for inspection. Asked about it, Min Longhai said that his cousin was a garment maker in Qingdao and the woman was recommended by Zhang Youdao for a job, and he did not sell the woman as a prostitute. The rest of the confession was vague. Min Youcai said that he did not know the situation and asked to be supervised. Zhang Youdao's confession was vague. Chen Yuli confessed that he was not an accomplice. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Min Longhai and Zhang Youdao to one year of imprisonment each. Min Youcai and Chen Yuli were released.</p>

<h3>Funeral Held for Detective Han Juncai, Who Died in the Line of Duty Apprehending Bandits</h3>
<h3>Impersonating Director of Ningbo Native Place Association, falsely claiming celebration for mother</h3>
<p>Seemingly aimed at fraudulently obtaining congratulatory gifts; Association sends letter to police to investigate</p>
<p>The Ningbo Natives Association in Shanghai sent a letter yesterday to the police departments of the International and French Concessions, stating: "We hereby inform you that someone is falsely using the name of our association's former director, Zhang Chuanbao, to distribute invitations to fellow Ningbo natives in Shanghai, falsely claiming an eightieth birthday celebration for his elderly mother and a wedding celebration for his niece, with the intention of defrauding people of money. After our association investigated the matter, we discovered that former director Zhang's mother had long passed away, and he has no niece getting married. Therefore, we are writing to request that your police departments immediately order investigators to look into the matter in order to clarify the truth. We would be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Conning a Blind Student out of his Typewriter</h3>
<p>Wu Guobiao, a student from St. John's University on Avenue Haig in Western Shanghai, has been blind since childhood. He uses his own Underwood English typewriter to write letters. The day before yesterday morning, a man speaking with a Tianjin accent came to his dormitory and asked to borrow the typewriter temporarily. Wu mistakenly thought he was a classmate and agreed to the request. However, by yesterday at around twelve o'clock, the man still had not returned. Realizing something was wrong, Wu immediately reported the matter to the Caojiadu police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>American Woman Graham, Detained in Japan, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Relates in detail the experience of being obstructed by the Japanese; Also says will never go to Japan again</p>
<p>Betty Graham, the American woman who was detained in Japan on suspicion of illegally photographing Japanese national defense sites, has been released after paying a fine by a Japanese court and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to Ms. Graham's statement to reporters, "I (Graham speaking of herself) unexpectedly became an international female spy for taking photos in Japan. After I was released, Japanese detectives followed me closely, never leaving my side. When boarding the train in Moji, I was again obstructed by Japanese police. Fortunately, another Japanese reporter explained the situation, and I was finally able to leave. All my cameras have now been confiscated by the Japanese and will be sold publicly. When I (Graham speaking of herself) was detained, I was on a mountaintop, taking photos from a high vantage point. Subsequently, Japanese police searched my hotel room, taking away all my personal letters for study. They then found multiple photographs in my suitcase, forcing me to go to the police station for questioning more than ten times. When I (Graham speaking of herself) stated that I did not understand Japanese, they refused to believe me and accused me of being a spy for a certain country. Although I have now been released and feel very fortunate, I will never go to Japan again."</p>
<h3>Jin Su, the Assailant in the Yan Duhe Stabbing Case, Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Two years of custodial measures to be implemented after completion of sentence; Yan Duhe submits a statement to the court recounting the previous events.</p>
<p>Jin Su, a clerk at the Jiangsu High Court from Suzhou, believed he was being harmed by Yan Duhe, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, through some kind of inexplicable magical force, and stabbed Yan with a file at the entrance of the Xinwen Bao building at 1 p.m. on the 25th of last month. Jin was also arrested. The case was tried twice by the First Special District Court. Jin Su was examined by Dr. Wei Ligong, a medical examiner at the First Special District Court, who concluded that Jin suffered from a mental illness characterized by incomplete intellectual and conscious development. Such mental illnesses often involve intense feelings of animosity and pose a danger to society and individuals, potentially implicating others. The illness is considered a dangerous and incurable mental disorder, requiring isolation or supervision. The case was continued yesterday morning in the criminal court by Chief Judge Qian Hongye. Yan Duhe, whose injuries were gradually healing, appeared in court with his attorneys Wu Zhiping and Yan Yinwu. Yan first submitted a statement detailing Jin's repeated harassment (see Yan's petition below), stating that he was fortunate to have suffered only minor injuries and requested a lenient sentence. However, for the sake of the safety of himself, the public, and the defendant, he requested the imposition of security measures and delivery to a guardian. Jin Su continued to maintain his original stance, claiming that the file he used to stab Yan was a foreign product, exceptionally strong, and impossible to break even during struggles. He argued that the fact that it broke without resistance proved that Yan possessed magical powers. Wang Yaotang, the police department's attorney, stated that although the plaintiff's injuries did not constitute serious harm, the methods used by the defendant met the criteria for causing serious injury under Article 178 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, he requested a sentence according to law. However, considering that the defendant suffered from mental deficiency, he requested that, in accordance with Article 87 of the Criminal Code, security measures, such as delivery to a guardian, be implemented after the completion of the sentence. The lawyer appointed by the court to defend the defendant argued that the defendant did not intend to cause serious harm to the plaintiff, but only sought to inflict some pain. Therefore, he requested that the sentence be based on the ordinary injury charge under Article 277 of the Criminal Code. Judge Qian, after reviewing the case, announced the court's judgment: Jin Su is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for causing bodily harm, and custodial measures will be implemented for two years after the completion of the sentence. Yan Duhe submitted a statement to the court after the incident, providing a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the incident. Here is a summary: "Approximately six or seven years ago, the defendant began sending letters, claiming that I possessed magical powers or a type of magic invented in India that could control his soul, causing him immense mental and physical suffering. The tone of the letters was deeply resentful, even including words such as 'attack the plaintiff.' These postcards were only signed with the name Jin Su and did not include an address. I found the defendant's claims of magical powers to be strange and paid attention to them, but after more than a year without further correspondence, I dismissed the matter, assuming it was just the disturbance of someone suffering from a mental illness. After some time, I received another letter with the same wording, but this time it included an address, demanding a clear response explaining why I was using magical powers to harm him. In order to dispel his delusion, I personally wrote a reply (which was found on the defendant when he was arrested). However, upon receiving the reply, the defendant not only failed to understand but accused me of self-incriminatingly admitting to using magical powers to harm him. Since he was unreasonable, I wrote to my friends Su Youcheng and Xiao Qing, asking them to visit the defendant to assess his condition and try to dissuade him.程later received a letter from 程stating that the defendant's demeanor was not rude and his speech was logical, but he adamantly insisted that I was harming him with magical powers, making it impossible to reason with him. It was clear that he had a mental disorder. The defendant's mother and brother also stated that the defendant suffered from a mental illness and asked me to be understanding. After this, the defendant came to the Xinwen Bao newspaper office to request a meeting, but I asked colleagues in the editing department to meet with him on my behalf. Aside from exhibiting signs of mental instability, he showed no unusual behavior. Last autumn, the defendant sent another letter, accusing me of avoiding him out of guilt. About one or two weeks after receiving this letter, the defendant came to request a meeting again. Hoping that a meeting would allow me to explain things in a sincere manner and perhaps bring him to his senses, I agreed to meet him and repeatedly explained that I did not understand magical powers and could not harm him in any way. I did not give him my name, but he suddenly asked, 'Are you Mr. Yan?' I sensed anger in his expression and pretended to be Zhang Zishi, a representative meeting guests on behalf of Mr. Yan, and told him that Mr. Yan did not understand magical powers and could not harm him in any way. I feared that he would never be able to answer this question, so the defendant left angrily, saying, 'Then, when necessary, I will eliminate you to get rid of the harm.' After he left, because he claimed to have read the writings of Jian Qiu in the newspaper, implying that he admired Chen Jun, I asked Chen Jun to write a letter to enlighten him. He remained unyielding. Later, he came to the office to request a meeting, which was held by my colleague Jiang Jianhou. The defendant then said that the Zhang Zishi he had met earlier was actually Yan Duhe and said he knew this because he asked the tea servant in the office. However, the defendant had now recognized my face and had a concrete target to carry out his long-planned assault. On April 18th, the defendant waited at the entrance of the office and approached me upon my arrival, saying, 'Mr. Yan, I have something to discuss.' I told him to wait in the reception room, but I went straight to my office and asked a colleague to meet with him on my behalf. After much entanglement, he finally left. Then, on the 25th, the stabbing incident occurred (details omitted as they have been reported in the newspaper). According to the defendant's confession at the police station, he had planned the attack in advance and deliberately targeted vital areas. His long-nurtured intention and the force he used demonstrated a deliberate intention to kill. However, based on his usual words, letters, and courtroom testimony, it can also be inferred that he suffers from mental deficiency. Therefore, I still hope that the court will appropriately reduce the sentence due to the defendant, but for the sake of maintaining my future safety and for the treatment of the defendant's illness, I request that security measures be announced as well. The law protects those who are mentally deficient. Their reason is unclear, and their behavior is unpredictable. If they are not placed under strict supervision, they may commit acts of violence against me today, and who knows if they will endanger others or even themselves in the future? My request is also for the safety of the public, not just to protect myself from future harm."</p>
<h3>Fake Gambling Den Cracked at the New New Hotel</h3>
<p>Sentences and fines imposed separately</p>
<p>Lu Dagong, a Chinese detective from the Mao Zha police station, and Huilinsheng, a Western detective, learned on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 8:30 p.m. that someone was organizing an active gambling table in room 417 of the New New Hotel on Nanjing Road, gathering people for gambling. They requested and received a search warrant from the First Special District Court and secretly went to the address, arresting the bosses Wang Jingsheng and Qu Hua, as well as fifteen other gamblers. They confiscated a set of Shan Pai Gow tiles, five dice, 403 silver dollars, 41 twenty-cent coins, 128 ten-cent coins, 44 nickel coins, and 162 one-cent copper coins. All of these items were taken to the police station for safekeeping. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police attorney Zhang Shizhu filed charges of gambling. After Judge Pan determined the facts were clear, he sentenced each defendant and imposed fines separately, and the gambling proceeds were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Yellow River Lottery Ticket Ring Busted in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Qian Yulin and two others prosecuted; Lu Quande found to be unrelated and released</p>
<p>The Finance Department of the Beiping Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee issued Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery tickets, entrusting the Beiping Municipal Bank to manage the wholesale distribution. Twenty-five installments have been issued, with monthly drawings and sales in various provinces of North China. Last month, someone presented a counterfeit winning ticket from the 24th installment for a prize. After investigation, it was learned that these counterfeit tickets were being distributed by the Han-purchasing department of the Dahua Deji Company at 54 Li Mei Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee sent Xu Xingru, a member of the Finance Department, to Shanghai to contact the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee's Shanghai Office. On the 20th of last month, they reported to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Qian Yulin of Changshu at 94 Li Mei Road. Qian confessed to selling counterfeit Yellow River Flood Relief Lottery tickets and said that Lu Quansheng of Baoshan, who operated a printing business at 162 East Zilaihuo Street, printed the tickets. The detectives subsequently arrested Lu and his brother Lu Quande. Lu admitted to printing all the printing plates and storing them at the home of his friend Cheng Buyun at 28 Huayi Youth Road. The detectives, together with detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, arrested Cheng and recovered the printing plates, seals, and movable type. All items were brought back to the police station and handed over to the Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Details have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Sun Peng, an official from the Second Court, presided over the criminal court and interrogated the case. Gu Shouxi, the police department's attorney, explained the case and charged Qian Yulin, Lu Quansheng, and Cheng Buyun with three crimes under Articles 201, Paragraphs 1 and 2, 339, and 165 of the Criminal Code: counterfeiting valuable securities, fraud, and destruction of evidence. Lu Quande was found to be unrelated and was not prosecuted, and a request for his release was made. Subsequently, the investigating detectives reported on the case and presented the evidence to the court. Qian Yulin confessed that he had previously operated a cigarette paper shop but had lost his job. He sold airline tickets, but business was slow, so he had Lu print counterfeit Yellow River Lottery tickets to sell and make a living. Lu Quansheng confessed that Qian had given him a sample and asked him to print 1,000 copies for 70 yuan, and that this was the only time. Cheng Buyun confessed that Lu Quansheng had left the printing plates at his place and that he was unaware of the counterfeiting. After reviewing the confessions, the court ordered closing arguments and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the 15th. The defendants were returned to custody, and Lu Quande was released without charge by the police department.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Should Not Use Foreign Licenses</h3>
<p>Trade Bureau issues directive to Factory Joint Association</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau yesterday issued a directive to the Factory Joint Association, stating: "We have received a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated April 14th, which states that the consulate general in Hanoi reported that the Haiphong office reported that the Tokyo Tax Office Inspector General stationed in Haiphong, Gudaibo, stated in person that the Haiphong post office had recently discovered Podong Ce medicine water sent from the Shanghai Nanjing Road Yanling Drugstore Business Department addressed to the Beautiful West French Inlay Tooth Clinic on Wenshan Road, Yunnan. The packaging, in addition to containing French instructions, also contained Chinese instructions. After investigation, it was determined that neither French trademark registrations nor French-produced medicines contained this type of medicine water. It is clearly a fake French product. Both the sender and receiver are within Chinese territory. If handled according to domestic law, the case should be submitted to the Haiphong local court for investigation. If handled according to international law, the matter can be simplified by requesting the French ambassador to China to negotiate with your government. However, due to the recent unresolved Newfu criminal litigation involving Chinese residents in Haiphong, the local customs does not wish to cause further disputes over this matter. My colleagues here believe that it is desirable to resolve matters simply. Please investigate and severely prohibit such behavior to avoid future international disputes. We are enclosing a copy of the instructions and requesting your Ministry to review and handle the matter and provide a response. Therefore, in addition to replying to the communication and issuing separate orders, we hereby order you to take note, investigate, rectify, and provide guidance to manufacturers. This is hereby ordered, in addition to issuing a general order and separate letters, we correspond to your association for your information, hoping you will provide guidance to your merchants and remind them to pay attention in order to emphasize reality and prevent confusion."</p>
<h3>Gao Yuzhu Launches Frontier Development Association</h3>
<p>Inaugural meeting of initiators on the 15th; Location: 9th floor of the YMCA</p>

<h3>Chen Shuzi, Who Embroidered the First Party Flag, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Madame Chen Shuzi, wife of Zhang Yongfu, a member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday noon on the Yangzi Shipping Company's SS Contepiacano from Singapore. Also arriving were Zhang's younger brother, Hua Dan, and his family, totaling seven people. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent representatives to welcome them. Both Zhang and his daughter (Mrs. Luo Longji) came to Shanghai from Nanjing to take care of everything. In addition to accompanying Madam Chen back to China, Zhang Hua Dan will also go to Nanjing to handle the burial arrangements for the late martyr Lin Yishun. According to Madam Chen Shuzi, when she was in Singapore, upon hearing of her husband's sudden illness and death, she forgot to bring back the original design for the first Party flag embroidered by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which was given to her personally. The design features a liberty bell in the center, with the word "Liberty" handwritten by Dr. Sun Yat-sen below the bell. The four corners contain the Party and National flag and the army and navy flags. It also includes inscriptions by Chairman Lin and Chairman Wang. The design is on yellow satin. It is now planned to send it from Singapore immediately. The Zhangs will stay in Shanghai for a short time before heading to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Niu Huisheng</h3>
<p>— Zhu Hengbi</p>
<p>— Address Delivered to Mr. Niu’s Relatives and Friends During the Funeral Service on May 8th</p>
<p>Mr. Niu Huisheng passed away at 2:50 AM on May 4th. It was only a little over three weeks away from the closing date of the Chinese Medical Association conference. During the conference, his body was already failing to support him. After the conference, he bravely went to Nanjing to attend the Medical Education Committee meeting, and upon returning, he took to his bed, growing weaker day by day until he could not rise again. His death was entirely due to his dedication to public service. This makes us all very saddened. After his death, Chinese and foreign individuals, from the highest central authorities to various public organizations, and from distant places like London and New York, sent condolence letters and telegrams like snowflakes. All highly praised him, expressed deep regret, and felt that China had lost a highly respected scholar. This shows the affection and respect Mr. Niu enjoyed during his lifetime.</p>
<p>In the condolence telegrams from various parties, Madame Chiang Song said, "Mr. Niu devoted his life to serving the country and society, sacrificing his personal life. His achievements will be forever recorded in history, not only as a model for the medical profession but also as an example for the entire nation. His sudden passing is a cause for great sorrow." Chairman Wang said, "The Chinese medical community has lost a distinguished talent, which is deeply regrettable." Liu Jiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, said, "Mr. Huisheng was a leading figure in the medical field. Hearing the sad news, I am filled with deep sorrow." The Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education said, "Committee Member Niu fell ill due to overwork. Upon hearing the sad news, we all mourn together." Mr. Jordan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, said that Mr. Niu's guidance was essential to the development of the Shanghai Municipal Council's medical services and that now that Mr. Niu has passed away, the Municipal Council feels as if it has lost its "right and left hands." It is evident that everyone recognizes Mr. Niu ⑴ as a leading figure in the medical field and ⑵ as someone who sacrificed his life for the public. These two points are by no means personal flattery from Hengbi.</p>
<p>To be called a leading figure in the medical field means that his academic achievements reached the highest level, like Mount Tai towering above the mountains, or the Big Dipper being surrounded by all the stars. Is there any evidence to prove this? Yes, there is. Hengbi remembers a friend with an orthopedic condition who traveled from China to the United States to seek treatment from a specialist. Upon arrival, the specialist asked, "Why did you come all the way to America for treatment?" The friend replied, "There are no such specialists in China." The American doctor said, "You don't know, China has the world-renowned orthopedic expert Niu Huisheng." This shows that his deep understanding in orthopedics was universally recognized. His attainment of such achievements was by no means accidental; it was the result of great effort. He opened an orthopedic hospital and performed over five thousand six hundred operations. Before each operation, he would study all relevant books on surgery and anatomy. On the night before the operation, his family was absolutely not allowed to talk to him, just like the ancient people's fasting and bathing before worshipping heaven, earth, and ancestors, quietly contemplating how to deal with the upcoming operation. During the operation, he personally inspected all sterilization procedures, never letting anything slip. Therefore, the treatment results were mostly very satisfactory. People only knew that his skills were good, but they didn't know how he became so good. It was all because he was able to work hard, diligently, carefully, and solemnly, which led to his achievements. After his death, it is hard to find an orthopedic expert like him in China. This spirit of a great physician truly deserves the title of "leading figure."</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, Mr. Niu accompanied the army. As the army moved, circumstances changed rapidly. Under Mr. Niu's guidance, the military doctors of the Revolutionary Army would arrive at every place before the main force. The army's medical services were managed very strictly and thoughtfully, allowing the commanding generals to focus on military planning. All wounded soldiers had access to well-arranged hospitals for treatment. During the warlord era, wounded soldiers would forcibly enter hospitals, disregard order, and fail to pay for treatment, so hospitals did not welcome them. When Mr. Niu was the chief of military medical services, wounded soldiers were required to pay for treatment, and losses were compensated at the market price. As a result, wounded soldiers received the best possible treatment, and hospitals everywhere did their best to help the Revolutionary Army consolidate morale. The success of the Northern Expedition, from the perspective of military medicine, was not without Mr. Niu's contribution. However, after the success of the Northern Expedition, Mr. Niu resigned from his military position and returned to Shanghai to live as an ordinary citizen. Mr. Niu's achievement without taking credit is truly admirable. This alone not only deserves the title of "leading figure in the medical field" but also truly makes him "an example for the entire nation," as Madame Chiang Song said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the medical community in our country has always been divided into factions. Mr. Niu believed that medicine should have no international boundaries and that factionalism was unfortunate for the Chinese medical community, which caused him great pain. Therefore, in his busy schedule, he worked hard to unite the medical community, merging the Bo Medical Association, which had a history of over forty years, with the Chinese Medical Association. At the beginning of the merger, there were various difficulties because at that time, Chinese people considered it an honor to join the Bo Medical Association and considered joining the Chinese Medical Association to be worthless, stubbornly believing that the Bo Medical Association had a higher status than the Chinese Medical Association. After more than a year of Mr. Niu's efforts, understanding was reached between the two sides, and the current Chinese Medical Association was established, completely breaking down the international concept of medicine. The current Chinese Medical Association has members from England, the United States, Germany, Japan, France, and Italy. This special organization is unique in the world. Without Mr. Niu's far-sighted vision and arduous perseverance, I am afraid that the medical community today, in addition to the old medicine, would have new medicine, and within new medicine, there would be the distinction between Chinese doctors and foreign doctors. In recent years, Mr. Niu has gone a step further, wanting all medical undertakings run by foreigners in the country to be under the guidance of the Chinese government to improve the health of the nation. This has also gained the sympathy of Chinese and foreigners, and concrete measures have been drafted. Unfortunately, before he could fully realize his plan, he passed away. Mr. Niu always considered the people and planned and served the medical community at all times. This spirit is indeed the style of a leading figure in the medical field.</p>
<p>As for his willingness to sacrifice his personal interests for public service, there is also evidence to prove it. Not only did he serve domestically, often rushing to do things regardless of his own safety, but he also sacrificed a great deal of energy internationally. During the European War, when the United States sent many doctors to serve at the front lines, he was the one who was sent to train those military doctors. The training results were excellent. Even now, the U.S. Department of the Army still often cares about him, with letters of inquiry being sent from time to time. This shows that although our country's soldiers did not participate in the European War, Mr. Niu personally represented our people in the war. His spirit of sacrifice can easily be seen here. He would treat people in the hospital who had no money and couldn't pay, and he would not let them go until they were cured. Therefore, his hospital often suffered losses, but he never cared. He knew that Mother Niu was very compassionate towards elderly women without support, so on his mother's sixty-ninth birthday, he donated ten thousand yuan to establish a nursing home in Maqiao to accommodate those poor women. On the day of the opening, he had been sick for a long time, and his face was terribly swollen, but he still personally accompanied his mother to the opening. His initial specialization in orthopedics was really not for himself but out of compassion for the many children suffering from orthopedic conditions, which society had no way to deal with, so he went to study it. He had been suffering from stomach problems for fourteen years and kidney problems for more than three years, but he still tried his best to serve society at all times, only regretting that there were not enough days. People thought that he was always living a life of luxury and enjoying all the blessings of the world. Little did they know that he was often in pain and could not eat good things, and he still had to work hard. Some people thought he was foolish, but some people in society relied on his foolishness to get some help. However, he himself ultimately sacrificed himself and ultimately shortened his life because of it. Furthermore, all the positions he held were unpaid positions. Recently, such as after stepping down as president of the Chinese Medical Association after serving two consecutive terms, he continued to serve as secretary-general for more than a year. Also, as the president of Zhongshan Hospital, a member of the Central Health Committee, a member of the Medical Education Committee, a member of the Forensic Review Committee, the chairman of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, a director of the Leprosy Relief Association, a director of the Child Welfare Association, an executive member and treasurer of the National Medical Association, and so on, not only did he not receive stipends, but he also had to take out money to help the progress of those many undertakings. Don't you think his spirit of sacrifice is worthy of admiration?</p>
<p>In Hengbi's opinion, his life had several virtues that can be summarized to praise him: First is loyalty. Loyalty to society, loyalty to the country, loyalty to his duties, loyalty to friends. Second is benevolence. He was inherently kind and happy to help others. Third is filial piety. His mother lived in two places with him, and he would visit her every night to inquire about her well-being. He had a strong sense of self-confidence. Without a good reason, it was absolutely impossible to make him obey, but if his mother said something, he would never disobey. His establishment of the nursing home was also an aspect of his filial piety. Fourth is straightforwardness. He was most straightforward, and the factional disputes in the medical community could often be resolved with just a word from him. He spoke without reservation, but his reasoning was very correct. When explaining reasoning, he was also extremely tactful and eloquent, able to convince people wholeheartedly. Fifth is forgiveness. Doctor Niu absolutely did not want to talk about other people's shortcomings. When people "spoke ill of others" to him, he would "look away and turn to other matters," as if he had not heard it. Such a good person, once passed away, we friends are really in extreme pain, and our tears have run dry. His will was to have a simple burial, and for relatives and friends not to send wreaths or banners to save unnecessary expenses and accumulate a small amount of money to subsidize pediatric orthopedics at Guangji Hospital in Hangzhou. Furthermore, our country has a great shortage of orthopedic talent. Mr. Niu often expressed during his lifetime that if he had the ability, he would have to find a way to have each medical school set up a special orthopedic chair to cultivate this talent. Unfortunately, heaven did not grant him many years, and he parted ways with the world before he could fulfill his wish. It is hoped that all of you present relatives and friends can continue to fulfill his will and his lifelong wishes, to help him achieve his goals, to commemorate him. Furthermore, what Hengbi has just said is only what I know and what I have thought of. I am sure that everyone present knows many other virtuous deeds of Mr. Niu. I hope everyone will write them out and send them to Madam Niu Xu, preparing to compile them into a commemorative publication to permanently commemorate him.</p>

<p>Comments</p>
<h3>Then What is Being Planned?</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato met with foreign journalists the other day and, referring to the North China issue, said that "Japan does not harbor the intention of establishing a special and exclusive sphere of influence in North China." We have long been accustomed to hearing such statements from the Japanese authorities. Now, assuming that Mr. Sato's words are true, then what is Japan planning in North China?</p>
<p>The autonomy movement was once a hot topic, and it has not yet subsided. Although such activities are ostensibly led by rogues and traitors, everyone knows who is behind them. What is this for?</p>
<p>Japan is demanding that our country conclude a so-called "anti-communist agreement," not only stationing troops to force us to agree but also including it in Hirota's Three Principles. Isn't this a conspiracy?</p>
<p>The Japanese garrison in North China has repeatedly expanded, and Japan conducts large-scale exercises from time to time. What is the purpose of these actions?</p>
<p>Japan's desire for the overall situation in North China is the so-called clarification of the Hebei-Chahar political power. Is this request truly legitimate? The establishment of the bogus East Hebei organization has been vigorously supported by Japan, which is also constantly seeking to expand it. What is the intention of this?</p>
<p>Furthermore, isn't Japan's recent drive to incite bandits and puppet troops to invade Suiyuan also a strategy to control North China?</p>
<p>Then Japan is not planning nothing in North China!</p>
<p>If Foreign Minister Sato claims that "Japan does not harbor the intention of establishing a special and exclusive sphere of influence in North China," then why does he also say, "However, it is difficult to resolve the political issues of North China immediately"? This alone is enough to show that Japan has designs on North China.</p>
<p>But the statement of the Japanese Foreign Minister is not surprising. Have we ever heard anyone publicly say that they want to invade someone? Unfortunately, this statement is a clumsy attempt to conceal the truth, only further exposing its ambitions.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan not only claims that it "has no intention of invading China," they even say that they are practicing "friendship" with us? "Empty words of friendship have been heard too often. The words sincerity have been defiled and have even become a joke." This sentence in the British newspaper is very true.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato also said: "The relations between the two countries have now fallen into an unpleasant state, which should not be the case for mutual benefit. However, this relationship has been going on for a long time, and we must find ways to remove obstacles." A reporter from the Central News Agency asked him, "What are these obstacles?" He replied: "It is better not to discuss this issue at present."</p>
<p>But in my opinion, Japan's attempt to control North China should be a major obstacle.</p>
<h3>People's School</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>A small door that can only accommodate two people side by side, with a blue wooden sign hanging at the entrance that reads "People's Elementary School," is where I will be living for a year. In the courtyard, there are two short elm trees. When the wind blows, the rustling sound is eerily penetrating. This is an ancient temple, and the houses have collapsed after years of wind and rain. Three east wing rooms are newly built with mud bricks. The white wooden door is locked with a large iron lock. Inside, sorghum, soybeans, and cakes are piled up in straw bags. Several tables and benches are piled haphazardly in the corner against the wall, covered with a thick layer of dust, on which are printed the footprints of cats and mice. The yellowed window paper has fallen off in shreds, and sparrows fly through the window frames like shuttles. Black and white speckled bird droppings are scattered all over the damp floor. A blackboard hangs askew on the wall, on which are written the statistics of sorghum and beans.</p>
<p>An old man of about sixty, wearing a long bamboo dry tobacco pipe, came staggering to greet me. After the temple keeper told me, I realized that he was the school trustee, a scholar from the Guangxu era. He sat hunched over on a stone tablet that had fallen into the mud, and after examining me for a while with his small eyes, he said:</p>
<p>"The schoolhouse is storing the village office's grain, which cannot be sold for the time being, and the house cannot be spared either. You should go back first, and I will find someone to carry your luggage."</p>
<p>I hesitated for a long time before reluctantly saying:</p>
<p>"Today is the opening day stipulated by the county government, and the Education Bureau just sent me here. If I go back, it won't be good if the county finds out in the future."</p>
<p>"I will take responsibility for that!" He stroked the gray beard at the corner of his mouth, with the air of an old grandfather speaking to his grandson, and asked me if I knew how to read feng shui. I frankly and somewhat angrily told him that studying at the normal school did not involve learning medicine or divination. He tapped the stone lightly with his tobacco pipe and said with a sneer:</p>
<p>"Studying now is just hanging up an empty sign, without any real skills. At most, it's just wasting public money or the blood and sweat of your parents and brothers. I have never supported Western schools, but to appease the officials, there is no way..."</p>
<p>After saying this, he swayed his thin legs, and the gray cloth hem of his robe fluttered away. In the afternoon, the temple keeper carried my luggage and returned to the county with me.</p>
<p>On the day of the opening, a farmer who had come to town to buy medicine brought a letter. I hired a four-mao donkey to carry my belongings and rushed to that ancient temple. After settling down in the room where I would sleep, more than a dozen bald-headed children with Qingni mud smeared on their eyebrows, hands, and backs had already arrived. One fair-skinned child with a half-foot-long braid and a large red velvet head rope trailing at the end asked him, but he was still the school trustee's grandson. They shook their bodies like sieves and recited in unison:</p>
<p>"The first day of the first month, oh, the first day of the new year, oh, get up at the fifth watch in the morning, oh, wash your hands and face, oh..."</p>
<p>I was surprised and told them that they didn't need to read this kind of thing. They all widened their small eyes and asked strangely:</p>
<p>"Teacher, then what should we read? Dad said that reading these five-character miscellaneous characters is useful to us and that we are not allowed to read books about cats and dogs."</p>
<p>I sighed, feeling that the spirits of these children were being gnawed at by a huge, venomous beast.</p>
<p>In the evening, the children had all gone home. I was writing a long-awaited letter to a friend living in the city by the light of a dim kerosene lamp when a ringing bicycle bell sounded outside the door. I opened the door, and in came Ziming, the county school inspector. He took out a copy of the county government's instructions from his briefcase and hurriedly asked him why he had come to the countryside at night. He said:</p>
<p>"In order to eliminate illiteracy and rescue out-of-school people, the province has ordered each township to set up a people's night school in the people's elementary school and, within three days, to provide the number of students enrolled in the register.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The province will send personnel to inspect people's education soon."</p>
<p>He said it very solemnly, not with the playful demeanor he usually had. The next day, I took the instructions to the old school trustee to see. He complained that I was not worldly-wise, pulled out a sheet of pink paper from his hat bucket, and said unhappily:</p>
<p>"Just write down the names of twenty people casually and hand it to him, and then paste a strip of paper for the people's night school on the door, and it's done."</p>
<h3>Willow Catkins</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>It is deep spring on the lake, and willow catkins fill the sky. Sitting idly on the Su Causeway, watching this clear snow in the sky, I cannot help but feel heartbroken.</p>
<p>According to the Materia Medica, the name willow catkins is actually not a flower. The Encyclopedia of Flowers says: "Willow trees grow in early spring, with soft catkins like tendons, more than an inch long, opening yellow flowers, scales rising on the catkins, very fine and fragmented, gradually growing leaves. By late spring, they are fully grown, with tiny seeds in the flowers, the size of millet grains, small, flat, and black, with white catkins like velvet, called willow catkins, also known as willow down. They fly in the wind, and if they land on wool clothing, they will produce insects. If they enter ponds and swamps, they will turn into duckweed flowers overnight..."</p>
<p>Willow catkins are not flowers, as people with a little botanical knowledge know today. The "small, flat, and black" seeds the "size of millet grains" with "white catkins like velvet" are for ease of dispersal and reproduction. Although the Encyclopedia of Flowers can explain that willow catkins are not flowers, it still acknowledges the unsubstantiated claim that "if they enter ponds and swamps, they will turn into duckweed flowers overnight."</p>
<p>Xixi Conghua says: "There are two kinds of willows, the Yang willow and the Liu willow. The leaves of the Yang willow are short, and the leaves of the Liu willow are long. The flowers are yellow stamens when they first bloom, and the seeds are flying catkins. Now, there are small green seeds in the catkins, and when they land on cement sand beaches, they will produce small green buds, which are the seedlings of the Liu willow. Su Dongpo's saying that catkins turn into duckweed is wrong."</p>
<p>Because willow catkins fly in the wind, people say that they are a symbol of frivolity. The Tang Dynasty poem says, "Crazy willow catkins dance with the wind," and the phrase "fickle as willow catkins" is still a curse word for women to this day. However, willow catkins themselves are very beautiful. In late spring, when cuckoos cry wildly, ten thousand dots of Yang flowers, light and graceful, make people suspect that this brocade-like spring is riding on these Yang flowers to return.</p>
<p>We can also find people who praise nature. The Southern Fireworks Records say, "Emperor Chen Houzhu and Zhang Lihua were playing in the back garden when willow catkins landed on their clothes. Lihua said to Chen Houzhu, 'How can they land on people's clothes?' He said, 'Light and floating things are what you mean.' In the life of Chen Houzhu and Zhang Lihua, who specialized in creating romantic history, Lihua was considered the most beautiful. If there were no willow catkins, it would not exist. Of course, this is not praising willow catkins themselves.</p>
<p>The Tang Shu says, "Emperor Xuanzong was fortunate to visit Jianzhang and saw Yang flowers landing on the clothes of his concubine, saying that they seemed to understand human intentions." This is a positive praise of willow catkins.</p>
<p>At present, willow catkins are probably considered useless, but willow catkins are useful. The Tang Shu Nanman Biography says, "The Holing Kingdom uses willow flowers and coconuts to make wine, which is slightly intoxicating." The Four People's Monthly Orders say, "On the third day of the third month and on the day of purification, collecting willow catkins can cure sores." The Sui Shi Ji says, "The people of Luoyang cook Yang flower porridge on the Cold Food Festival." The Flower History says, "During the reign of Emperor Xian Sheng of the Song Dynasty, Yang flowers were collected for winter shoe socks and felt rugs." Even now, I have collected willow catkins for use in printing ink, and its lightness is even better than that of mugwort floss. However, it is very troublesome to remove the black seeds. Children in my hometown, when Yang flowers are flying, accidentally break their hands and bleed, and they use these willow catkins to cover them to stop the bleeding. Sometimes it is effective, which is probably the remaining meaning of the Four People's Monthly Orders, "Collecting willow catkins can stop bleeding." However, it is not "collected and prepared for use on the third day of the third month and on the day of purification."</p>
<p>Men Shi Xin Hua, "The saying goes: 'Southern people do not know snow, saying it is like Yang flowers.' However, there are no flowers in Yang in the South, so it is known that Southern people do not know snow, and they also do not know Yang flowers." There is no one in the Jianghuai and Wuyue regions who does not know snow. Then, the so-called Southern people here naturally refers to people in the Minyue region, but there are also no "flowerless" willows in the Minyue region. What Men Shi Xin Hua says is really unknown what it is based on?</p>
<p>Qing Yi Lu, "Lu Wenji had a jade pillow bone, so all solid pillows were unusable. Relatives and friends made Yang flower pillows as gifts, and he was able to sleep peacefully." Recently, I have been lying sick in the empty mountains, often feeling that the pillow is hard and difficult to sleep on. Sometimes, I feel more uncomfortable with the pillow when I can't sleep. How can I collect a large number of willow catkins in this late spring and make a pillow to sleep on?</p>
<p>There are really too many poems about willow catkins. Here, I would still like to introduce a work by an unnamed prostitute.</p>
<p>The Complete Tang Poems says, "When Wei Tan was asked about the dismissal of Ezhou, the officials and subordinates held a farewell banquet. Tan once wrote a sentence from Wen Xuan, 'The saddest thing is parting, climbing mountains and facing water to send you home,' and gave the paper to the officials, asking them to continue the sentence. After hesitating, a prostitute stood up and said with tears, 'I am not talented and dare not dip the brush, but I want to orally recite two sentences.' Wei was greatly surprised and ordered her to recite, saying, 'The Wujing has countless newly planted willows, but I don't see Yang flowers hitting my face and flying.' All the guests praised and sighed, and Wei ordered her to sing as a willow branch song."</p>
