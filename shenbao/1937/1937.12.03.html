<p>東戰塲抗戰形勢、近日我軍頗見穩定、其原因一則積極補充、增加作戰力量、一則自戰綫移至山嶺地帶後、易取守勢、故前綫消息傳來、使人振奮、據昨日本報所得各方戰訊、綜合如下、㊀江陰要塞在我翁照垣將軍統率之下、大軍二萬、應付裕如、日維傾力攻襲、我陣地仍安如磐石、㊁常州我陣綫西移後、現堅守奔牛附近之地區、外傳陵口被佔、實係訛傳、㊂金壇東郊、我已構成新工事、準備迎擊、惟連日金壇•溧陽．丹陽•溧水•句容•各縣、均遭慘烈轟炸、民間損失之重、難以數計、㊃右翼廣德、已兩失兩得、現由我軍堅守中、該處有叢山峻嶺、迂迴曲折、日軍以地形不熟、輙遭我軍之奇襲、㊄崇德石門灣之繼、戰事已入緊張狀態、日軍似有威脅杭垣模樣、現我已在石門•桐鄕•及沿京杭國道之白沙村•靑山關•三橋埠•等處配置重兵扼守、可保無虞、㊅駐防海鹽之我軍、因受左翼及中路西移之影響、已現突出之勢、奉令改守海寗沿塘一帶、堅守此重要之據點、</p>
<p>［南京］據美聯社記者今日報稱、華軍在東戰場雖有一部份向後移動、但此間人心、仍極鎮靜、衆意中央精銳、必能於南京一帶予日軍以最猛烈之打擊、據稱、蔣委員長最近曾於中山陵園默禱一整日云、（一日國民電）</p>

<p>廣德業於一日午由我收復、當三十日晨激戰之際、我軍□□師師長饒國華、曾奮勇抗戰、按右翼之日軍自長興分兩路進犯、而以主力西向廣德、經二十八•二十九•兩日之激戰、飛機塲一帶於三十日午失陷、我軍卽退守距城三四公里、但仍堅守據點、奮勇抗戰、屢進屢退、相持甚久、饒師長身先士卒、雖在日軍坦克車及野砲轟擊猛暴進攻之下、猶鎭守據點、指揮作戰、以是日軍傷亡甚多、而饒師長卒以身殉、同時旅團長三人亦受傷、士卒異常痛憤、此時我軍因工事俱被炸燬、不得不自廣德西移、此役戰事之激烈、為我軍退出淞滬以後所僅見、日軍雖隨踪抵誓師渡鎭一帶、但我饒師將士同仇敵愾之心益深、俟機還擊、此時我安徽守軍、乘日軍立足未定之際北進突擊、日軍倉惶應戰、野砲兩門及裝甲車槍械等多不及運走、泗安鎭旣收稪、日軍腹背受擊、乃由廣德一帶繞道公路之東北向長興潰退、於是淪陷日軍一晝夜餘之廣德、於一日午完全克復、現正肅淸泗安鎭廣德一帶、及此地帶公路以外之殘餘日軍、</p>

<h3>日總領事對香港態度</h3>
<p>恫嚇之說係屬誤會　香港普及防空運動</p>
<p>［香港］港日領水澤二日談、余昨日謁港輔政司、謂港有某種分子組排日活動、有等與日商交易之商店亦遭恫嚇、受雇於日商之工人、亦接恐嚇函、港昨發生之炸彈案、顯係排日之活動、余信港必有排日秘密組織、故求港府加以取締、否則日與港關係將受影響云、（二日專電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］外傳日本駐港總領事、因中國政府官員在港作抗日活動、曾向香港當局施行“恫嚇”、惟倫敦未接徵實消息、如日總領事確有此舉、則料香港總督羅富國爵士、必已嚴詞答覆之、但此間當局迄今未接爵士關於此事之情報（二日路透電）</p>
<p>［香港］香港二日晨接得倫敦方面消息、謂據同盟社訊、日軍事當局曾警吿港政府、要求禁止反日運動、否則香港將不免被捲入中日糾紛之漩渦、倫敦人士得訊後、頗感不安、香港英文電聞報記者二日晨往訪日駐港總領水澤、叩詢此事、據答稱、此說純係出於誤會、余昨日往見輔政司、談及香港有祕密反日組織事、請求港政府予以取締、並謂此等組織、若不加以取締、則日本與港當局之關係、將受影響、或影響至某種程度但此非向港政府警吿或恐嚇云、（二日專電）</p>
<p>［香港］日本駐港總領事今日對東京方面所發表日本通訊社所傳、渠曾警吿香港當局云云、特向路透社記者、鄭重否認稱、“余之談話實被誤傳、余昨日因與日商交易之碼頭工人及各中國商行接獲秘密團體所發出之恐嚇函、遂向香港殖民聽長提出抗議、余僅喚起香港政府注意、此類事件如不遏止、英日關係或將發生障礙、”按日本通訊社所傳消息、謂香港日總領事請香港當局注意、近來出入香港之中國政府領袖若干人、曾在港作不利於日本之政治活動、宜予完全遏止、並發警吿、謂香港當局如再容忍此種活動、則恐香港終將陷入中日爭端之漩渦云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於日本警吿香港一事、向來主張孤立之每日快報、今日以嚴厲之社評聲稱、“倘英國果被牽入遠東之戰爭漩渦、則日本恐將不能再行談笑自若矣、香港非上海公共租界、甚至非代管區域可比、香港與直布羅多瑪爾泰、塞浦路斯、及錫蘭等處相同、英國决以最後之一卒一彈保守”云、卽向主和平之新聞記事報亦稱、“卽保守黨政府、亦萬難容忍他國直接攻擊英國之國旗、或欲操縱英國領土之政策”云云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>［香港］香港政府今日宣布舉行實際防空運動、俾港地居民、對於防空事宜、得有認識、此後兩週內、將舉行公開防空演講、以萬一遭遇空襲時之各種防空方法、指導居民、現已邀請各商行派代表聽講、並請彼等在其他方面與當局合作、從事萬一之備、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>常陰沙並未淪陷日艦離開狼山江面</h3>
<p>常陰沙難民逃出萬餘　上海郵包轉南通轉口</p>
<p>南通通信、狼山江面日艦、二十七日晨、共計泊三十二艘、乃各艦突然向下游開去、至午、江面已無一艦、晚僅來四艘、在江陰要塞江面、尚有三艘、時有斷續砲聲、南通安謐如常、南通戒嚴司令官部、以謠言甚熾、特布吿民衆、母輕信浮言、沿江防務鞏固、絕無足慮、</p>
<p>南通西南江中之常陰沙、前傳失陷說不確、緣該沙臨東北江面、受日艦威脅、南通第五區區長金鼎、將卷械遷移來通、遂致訛傳、目下狼山江面日艦、掃數駛往上海、南通常陰沙間義渡船已通行、沙洲安謐如常、各港仍由我大軍扼守、防務鞏固、但二十七日、沙洲難民、紛乘義渡船來通男女老幼、逃出多至一萬餘人、西南兩部人民、則均向江陰方面逃避、情形極慘、</p>
<p>通邑地處江北、非用兵區域、連日江南及浙東戰區難民、紛紛來通、茲聞上海租界當局、鑒於收容戰區難民、感覺供應上管理上種種困難、主張劃出通屬一帶、為收容難民區域、已向中日雙方商洽、可望日現、</p>
<p>上海與長江各埠、曁京滬津浦綫南段郵件、刻均由南通轉遞、每次裝卸、數近千袋、郵局職員、極為忙碌、因難民北渡者愈多、舟車運輸、尤不暇給、天生港為英義輪船停泊碼頭、貨物山積、均待輪運滬、（十一月二十八日）</p>

<h3>The New Defense Line from Zhenjiang and Danyang to Jintan is Ready</h3>
<p>Mountainous Areas are Easy to Defend. Guangde and Si'an are Recaptured One After Another. The Jiangyin Fortress Remains in Our Hands.</p>
<p>[Hankou] According to the latest news here, China's new defense line has been deployed, stretching from Zhenjiang and Danyang to Jintan. The northern end of this line is Zhenjiang, located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, about seventy kilometers from Nanjing. The Chinese side strongly asserts that military authorities initially planned this gradual withdrawal. Therefore, the retreat of Chinese troops is orderly and disciplined, inflicting significant losses on the Japanese army. Authoritative sources believe that Japan will not be able to attack Nanjing by sailing up the Yangtze River in the short term. Military experts believe that even if Japan breaks through the blockade line near Jiangyin, it will still take several days. However, China can also build a new blockade line near Zhenjiang. (1st National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>The war situation on the eastern battlefield has been relatively stable recently. This is due to active replenishment and increased combat power, as well as the shift of the battle line to mountainous areas, making defense easier. Therefore, news from the front line is encouraging. According to war news from various sources obtained by this newspaper yesterday, a summary is as follows: ㊀ Under the command of General Weng Zhaoyuan, the Jiangyin Fortress has 20,000 troops, who are well-prepared to cope with the situation. Despite the Japanese army's all-out attacks, our positions remain as solid as a rock. ㊁ After our battle line in Changzhou shifted westward, we are now firmly defending the area near Benniu. Rumors that Lingkou was occupied are false. ㊂ On the eastern outskirts of Jintan, we have constructed new fortifications to prepare for counterattacks. However, the counties of Jintan, Liyang, Danyang, Lishui, and Jurong have been subjected to fierce bombings for days, and the civilian losses are incalculable. ㊃ Guangde on the right flank has been lost and regained twice and is currently firmly defended by our army. The area has towering mountains with winding paths. Unfamiliar with the terrain, the Japanese army is often ambushed by our troops. ㊄ Following the battle of Chongde Shimen Bay, the war has entered a tense state. The Japanese army seems to be threatening Hangzhou. We have deployed heavy troops in Shimen, Tongxiang, and along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway in Baisha Village, Qingshan Pass, and Sanqiaobu to guard against danger. ㊅ The Chinese army stationed in Haiyan has been affected by the westward shift of the left flank and central route, and now appears to be protruding. It has been ordered to change its defense to the Hai'ning embankment area and firmly defend this important stronghold.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to an Associated Press reporter today, although part of the Chinese army is moving backward on the eastern battlefield, the morale here remains very calm. The public believes that the central elite troops will inflict the most violent blow on the Japanese army in the Nanjing area. It is said that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek recently prayed silently at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum for a whole day. (1st National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a public announcement released by the Chinese military authorities, the Sichuan Army defending Guangde launched a counterattack today, severely inflicting damage on a Japanese column in the Guangde-Si'an area. These two places were previously occupied by the Japanese army, Guangde being particularly important, as it is home to one of China's best airfields. From there, the Japanese army could also spy on Wuhu and flank the Chinese army in Nanjing. The Sichuan Army fought on the front lines for the first time and achieved good results, recovering the two places after a vigorous counterattack. (2nd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Guangde was recovered by our forces at noon on the 1st. During the fierce battle on the morning of the 30th, Rao Guohua, the commander of the [unclear] division of our army, fought bravely. The Japanese army on the right flank advanced on Guangde from Changxing in two routes, with the main force heading west. After fierce battles on the 28th and 29th, the airfield area fell into enemy hands at noon on the 30th. Our army retreated to a point three or four kilometers away from the city, but continued to firmly defend its strongholds, fighting bravely and advancing and retreating repeatedly for a long time. Division Commander Rao led by example, and even under the fierce bombardment and violent attacks of Japanese tanks and field guns, he still defended his stronghold and commanded the battle, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. However, Division Commander Rao eventually died in battle. At the same time, three brigade commanders were also injured, and the soldiers were extremely grieved and indignant. At this time, our army had to retreat westward from Guangde because all the fortifications had been destroyed. The intensity of this battle was unprecedented since our army withdrew from Shanghai. Although the Japanese army followed the retreat to the area where the oath was taken to cross the town, the officers and soldiers of my Rao Division deepened their hatred of the enemy and waited for an opportunity to counterattack. At this time, the Anhui garrison of our army took advantage of the Japanese army's unstable foothold and launched a surprise attack from the north. The Japanese army responded in a hurry, and two field guns and armored vehicles, as well as other firearms, were not transported in time. With Si'an Town recovered, the Japanese army was attacked from both sides and retreated from the Guangde area northeastward along the highway to Changxing. Thus, Guangde, which had fallen to the Japanese army for more than a day and night, was completely recovered at noon on the 1st. We are now clearing the remaining Japanese troops in the Si'an Town and Guangde area, as well as outside the highway in this area.</p>
<p>[London] British Consul in Nanjing, Mr. Barlen, and the British Deputy Military Attaché, Mr. Frazer, are still in Nanjing. Twenty-one British citizens from the British Embassy are staying in Nanjing, some of whom are on a British gunboat, while most are sheltering on Jardine Matheson's ship about four miles upstream. The ship has also reserved space for the German Consul and his staff, eleven people under the protection of the German Embassy, some American citizens (including five women), and three Dutch citizens. The British authorities have informed the Japanese authorities that the ship is now used for British citizens and others to avoid being affected by the war. (1st Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Frankfurt. According to a report from a Frankfurt News correspondent stationed in Hankou today, China has now regrouped a large army to resist the Japanese invasion. Most of the Chinese Central Army, which has not yet participated in the war, will be the core force of this reorganization, and will be supplemented by reserve forces from various regions. It is also reported that some administrative departments of the Chinese government have been established in Hankou. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Conference, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, Wang Longhui, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Zhang Wei, Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, have all arrived one after another and have begun working.

<h3>The German Ambassador Will Hold Ceasefire Talks with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek Regarding the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>The Key Point is to Persuade China to Join the Anti-Communist Pact. Hankou Believes These Talks Have Little Hope of Success.</p>
<p>[Hankou] German Ambassador to China, Dr. Oskar Trautmann, departed from Hankou for Nanjing on the 30th of last month, accompanied by Vice Minister Xu Mo. According to reliable sources, the German Ambassador will hold ceasefire talks with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing regarding the Sino-Japanese War. The reconciliation terms proposed by the German side include the following three points: ㊀ Japan should make a clear statement that it has no territorial ambitions in North China and only wants to cooperate with China economically. ㊁ China should join the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Communist Pact. ㊂ The Japanese army should withdraw from Chinese territory. The above minimum terms for reconciliation are said to have been agreed upon by Germany and represent a clear concession compared to the original terms proposed by Japan. It is not yet known whether the terms proposed by Germany will be accepted by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. It is said that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek may provide an answer. However, although Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has agreed to discuss the matter with the German Ambassador, this is not an indication that the Chinese government has abandoned its policy of resistance. According to Chinese opinions here, China has never wanted to go to war with Japan and has always expressed its willingness to resolve disputes peacefully, as long as Japan respects China's territorial and administrative integrity. Now that Germany is willing to act as a mediator, China is of course willing to discuss with it. However, Chinese leaders in Hankou believe that these talks have little hope of success, as it is doubtful whether these proposals are sincere, and it is believed that this is an attempt to cut off China's support from the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Chinese leaders expressed disappointment that these parties have not provided China with effective substantive assistance. They said that they would welcome a formal announcement of sanctions against Japan or a declaration of war by the Soviet Union against Japan. They now admit that both of these are unlikely to happen. Chinese leaders still insist on resisting Japan and are waiting for news of the outcome of the Nanjing talks. (2nd Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Qingdao Municipal Government Personnel Retreat</h3>
<p>All Chinese Banks Suspend Business. Export Ships are Crowded with Passengers.</p>
<p>[Qingdao] There is considerable panic here due to fears that the Japanese may send troops to land in Qingdao. Reuters learned today that all Chinese banks in Qingdao have suspended business, including the Bank of China. Export ships are crowded with Chinese people fleeing the area. Qingdao municipal government personnel have retreated, and it is rumored that Mayor Shen Honglie is also preparing to leave Qingdao. Shipping companies have received warnings to have their ships ready to set sail, as they must leave the port within half an hour of receiving notice at any time. It is now believed that this may indicate that the Chinese authorities intend to block the port, as sinking a ship in the port would accomplish this. At the same time, residents of Sifang (phonetic) area, about fifteen miles from the center of Qingdao, have received orders to evacuate. According to foreign observers, this move is likely intended by the Chinese to destroy the Japanese cotton mills in the area. (2nd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Consul-General's Attitude Toward Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Threatening Remarks are a Misunderstanding. Air Defense Exercise is Popular in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Japanese Consul-General Mizusawa spoke on the 2nd: Yesterday, I visited the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong and said that certain elements in Hong Kong have organized anti-Japanese activities. Stores that trade with Japanese merchants have also been threatened, and workers employed by Japanese merchants have also received threatening letters. The bombing in Hong Kong yesterday was obviously an anti-Japanese activity. I believe that there must be a secret anti-Japanese organization in Hong Kong, so I asked the Hong Kong government to crack down on it, otherwise the relationship between Japan and Hong Kong will be affected. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] It is rumored that the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong has exerted "threats" to the Hong Kong authorities because Chinese government officials are conducting anti-Japanese activities in Hong Kong, but London has not received any concrete information. If the Japanese Consul-General has indeed done this, then it is expected that the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, must have responded sternly. However, the authorities here have not yet received information from the Governor regarding this matter. (2nd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] News was received in Hong Kong on the morning of the 2nd from London that, according to Domei News Agency, Japanese military authorities had warned the Hong Kong government, demanding that it prohibit anti-Japanese movements, otherwise Hong Kong would inevitably be drawn into the whirlpool of Sino-Japanese disputes. Reporters from the English-language newspaper in Hong Kong visited Mizusawa, the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, on the morning of the 2nd to inquire about this matter. He replied that this statement was purely a misunderstanding. I visited the Colonial Secretary yesterday to discuss the existence of secret anti-Japanese organizations in Hong Kong and asked the Hong Kong government to crack down on them, saying that if these organizations are not cracked down on, the relationship between Japan and the Hong Kong authorities will be affected, or affected to some extent, but this is not a warning or threat to the Hong Kong government. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong solemnly denied to Reuters reporters today the news transmitted by the Japanese news agency to Tokyo that he had warned the Hong Kong authorities, saying, "My remarks have been misinterpreted. Yesterday, because dockworkers and Chinese merchants who trade with Japanese merchants received threatening letters from secret groups, I protested to the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong. I only drew the Hong Kong government's attention to the fact that if such incidents are not stopped, Anglo-Japanese relations may be hindered." According to news transmitted by the Japanese news agency, the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong asked the Hong Kong authorities to pay attention to the fact that some leaders of the Chinese government who have recently entered and exited Hong Kong have been engaged in political activities in Hong Kong that are detrimental to Japan, and should be completely suppressed, and issued a warning, saying that if the Hong Kong authorities continue to tolerate such activities, Hong Kong will eventually fall into the whirlpool of Sino-Japanese disputes. (3rd Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Japanese warning to Hong Kong, the Daily Express, which has always advocated isolationism, claimed in a stern editorial today, "If Britain is indeed drawn into the whirlpool of the Far East war, then Japan may no longer be able to talk and laugh so freely. Hong Kong is not comparable to the Shanghai International Settlement, or even a mandated territory. Hong Kong is the same as Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, and Ceylon. Britain will defend it with the last soldier and the last bullet." Even the pro-peace News Chronicle said, "Even the Conservative government would find it impossible to tolerate a direct attack by another country on the British flag, or a desire to manipulate the policies of British territory." (2nd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong government announced today that it will hold a practical air defense exercise so that residents of Hong Kong can have an understanding of air defense matters. In the next two weeks, public air defense lectures will be held to guide residents on various air defense methods in case of an air raid. Various commercial firms have been invited to send representatives to attend the lectures and to cooperate with the authorities in other aspects in preparation for any eventuality.

<h3>Japanese Troops Will Pass Through the Concession Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Dōmei News Agency's local news said that the Japanese military authorities confirmed last night at 8:00 PM that several Japanese troops will pass through the Public Concession today and tomorrow. Starting at 11:00 AM this morning, Japanese troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, departed from the Toyota Cotton Mill in western Shanghai, passing through Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, turning to Foch Road, then turning to Yu Qiaqing Road, then turning to Nanjing Road, and reaching Hongkou from the Bund. An aircraft also provided cover in the air. Tomorrow, they will return along the Bund to the 16th Wharf and enter the South City.</p>
<h3>Obstacles in the Southern Huangpu River are Being Destroyed</h3>
<p>Transportation sources said that the Japanese military authorities decided to completely destroy all obstacles in the blockade line on the Huangpu River starting on the 1st, due to the busy transportation in the Southern Huangpu area. Those on the surface of the water were burned with fire, and those under the water were blown up with explosives. The project is huge and cannot be completed in a few days.</p>
<h3>Building Committee Electrical Bonds to be Drawn in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Banking sources said that the Building Committee's Electrical Bonds were drawn in Shanghai on the morning of the 1st. The long-term four bonds are 07, 16, 79, and 95. The short-term eight bonds are 32, 35, 37, 50, 80, 81, 85, and 92. The principal repayment is 260,000, plus interest of 32,750, which will be paid starting this month.</p>
<h3>Students at Northwest University are Implementing Wartime Training</h3>

<h3>Changyinsha has not Fallen, and Japanese Warships have Left the Waters of Langshan</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Refugees Flee from Changyinsha. Shanghai Parcels are Rerouted to Nantong for Transshipment.</p>
<p>Nantong correspondence: On the morning of the 27th, a total of 32 Japanese warships were anchored in the waters of Langshan. Then, the ships suddenly sailed downstream. By noon, there were no ships on the river. Only four ships came at night. There were still three ships in the waters of the Jiangyin Fortress. There were intermittent gunshots from time to time. Nantong was as peaceful as usual. The Nantong Martial Law Command issued a notice to the public, urging them not to easily believe rumors, as the coastal defense was solid and there was nothing to worry about, due to the rampant rumors.</p>
<p>The previous reports of the fall of Changyinsha in the southwest of Nantong are inaccurate. Because the sandbar faces the northeast river and is threatened by Japanese warships, Jin Ding, the district chief of the 5th district of Nantong, moved his equipment to Nantong, leading to false rumors. Currently, all the Japanese warships in the waters of Langshan have sailed to Shanghai. The ferryboats between Nantong and Changyinsha have resumed operation, and the sandbar is as peaceful as usual. Our army still guards the ports and the defense is solid. However, on the 27th, as many as 10,000 refugees from the sandbar, men, women, old, and young, fled to Nantong by ferry. People in the southwest fled to Jiangyin, and the situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Nantong is located north of the Yangtze River and is not a war zone. In recent days, refugees from the Jiangnan and eastern Zhejiang war zones have flocked to Nantong. It is reported that the authorities in the Shanghai concession, in view of the various difficulties in supply and management in accommodating refugees from the war zone, are advocating designating the Nantong area as a refugee accommodation area and have negotiated with both China and Japan, which is expected to happen soon.</p>
<p>Mail between Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River, as well as the southern section of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Tianjin Railway, is currently being transshipped through Nantong. Each loading and unloading involves nearly a thousand bags, and postal workers are extremely busy. As more refugees cross north, transportation by boat and car is particularly insufficient. Tianshenggang is a pier for British and Italian ships, and goods are piled up like mountains, all waiting to be shipped to Shanghai. (November 28th)</p>

<h3>Results of British-French Talks Notified to German Ambassador to the UK</h3>
<p>Poland Also Intends to Claim a Share of Colonies; Germany Denies Affecting Belgian and Portuguese Territories</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden recently met with German Ambassador Ribbentrop in the afternoon to provide supplementary information regarding the public announcement made after the British-French talks. He also explained the British and French governments' views on a "Comprehensive Solution to European Problems." It is reported that Ribbentrop agreed to convey all points mentioned by the Foreign Secretary to the German government. He also informed the Foreign Secretary that reports in certain British newspapers regarding Germany's demands concerning the Belgian Congo and Portuguese Angola in Africa are untrue. Regarding colonial issues, the views of anyone not directly responsible for German politics are insufficient to represent the German government. Germany's official views had been explained by Führer Hitler and Aviation Minister General Göring to Lord Halifax, the British Lord Privy Seal. Namely, Germany's demand for return is limited to its former colonies. However, if certain former colonies cannot be returned to Germany due to military strategic considerations, Germany is willing to accept any compensatory measures proposed by the UK. British observers generally believe that Germany has always advocated for bilateral negotiations, so the proposal for a "Comprehensive Solution to European Problems" may not be welcomed by Germany. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet held a regular meeting this morning to hear Prime Minister Chamberlain's report on the British-French talks. Regarding the colonial issue, the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office will conduct a lengthy period of preparatory work to determine the nature of concessions to Germany acceptable to the countries involved. At the same time, the British government will explore the views of Belgium on the one hand, and maintain contact with France through diplomatic channels on the other, to decide what concessions can be made on colonial territory issues in the future. Regarding French Foreign Minister Delbos's planned visit to Central European countries, the British generally believe that this is a preliminary diplomatic move with three objectives: first, to reaffirm the strong and united relationship between Britain and France; second, to express Britain's stake in the security of Central and Eastern Europe; and third, to inquire about the potential contributions of Central European countries to a comprehensive solution to European problems. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>[London] After the report that Germany was demanding territories in the Belgian Congo and Portuguese Angola was denied by Berlin, political figures here expressed satisfaction. They believed that after the rumor surfaced, Belgium was greatly shaken, and the British, German, and Belgian governments immediately exchanged views through diplomatic channels, resulting in Germany's denial. Informed sources in Britain still maintain that the information is reliable. The plan to establish companies with special privileges within the Congo and Angola to develop these colonies was originally proposed by former German Economics Minister Schacht to British Lord Privy Seal Halifax, but Schacht has now left office. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Warsaw The Polish Foreign Minister Beck, in a declaration made on January 29th of last year, stated, "If the colonial question is raised for discussion on an international scale, our country should enjoy common rights and receive equal treatment with other countries concerned with this issue." Now that Germany's demand for colonies is progressing internationally, Polish public opinion is revisiting this declaration. Regarding this matter, the moderate newspaper "Warsaw Evening News" recently published an article with the title, "When French Foreign Minister Delbos Comes to Poland, Polish Officials Should Raise the Issue of Granting Poland a Mandate Over Colonies." The article stated that Poland has a population of 34 million but no colonies, while the Netherlands and Belgium each have populations of only 8.5 million and yet possess colonial empires, which is unfair. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Brussels After the German newspapers denied reports that Germany was demanding to participate in the administration of the Belgian Congo in Africa, officials here expressed satisfaction. Regarding this report, before the denial was issued by the German newspapers, Belgian newspapers responded strongly and unanimously published a message from the semi-official Belgian news agency stating that the Belgian authorities had repeatedly declared that any action attempting to seize Belgian colonies would not be tolerated. The "Belgian National News" stated that this was a ridiculous joke that must be stopped as soon as possible. Now that our new cabinet has been established, we should solemnly declare that Belgium's colonies are not to be challenged. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] A British newspaper reported that German Führer Hitler, in a meeting with British Lord Privy Seal Halifax, proposed returning Cameroon and Togoland to Germany, and establishing a company with special privileges within the Belgian Congo and Portuguese Angola to develop them, which should be controlled by Germany. Political figures here expressed great dissatisfaction upon hearing the news and specifically denied it, stating that the talks between Führer Hitler and Lord Halifax were of a general nature, only requesting the restoration of Germany's former colonies, and did not involve other colonies. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Responsible figures here recently declared that after the British and French authorities conducted talks, it has been proven that the policies of both sides are completely consistent. When Foreign Minister Delbos visits Central European countries in the coming days, his statements will be more forceful as a result. The current policies of Britain and France will not be significantly altered in general, and they will continue to adhere to their existing obligations. In essence, both sides aim to stabilize the general situation, and therefore are prepared to hold talks with Italy and Germany at any time as a starting point for a comprehensive solution to European problems. The British and French authorities did not directly reject the German demand for colonies, but stated that this issue should be resolved in conjunction with other European issues, which is why. It is generally believed that the attitude adopted by the British and French authorities is both compromising and realistic, and other countries will not be able to make excessive demands or protest. In addition, one point to note is that although both sides are eager to establish arms reduction agreements with various countries, they must continue to expand their military strength separately at this time.

<h3>Japanese Army Detains US Ship, Apologizes and Settles the Matter</h3>
<p>The Ship Has Now Been Returned to US Merchants; Public Opinion Concerned about the Far East Situation</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull declared today that regarding the Japanese army's detention of the US ship "Feiting" and insult to the American flag, Japanese Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa has expressed regret to the US authorities. The ship has now been returned to the US merchant company Wei Li Han Foreign Firm in Shanghai. Although Hull did not make a definitive statement, observers believe that the State Department considers the matter closed. (National News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Far East situation remains a concern for American public opinion, as news from Tokyo indicates that Japan may declare war on China in the near future. This has also caused unease in American diplomatic circles, who believe that if Japan does so, the US government will inevitably find it difficult to deal with, and the implementation of the Neutrality Act will become even more acute. Informed sources here also said that although President Roosevelt has decided not to invoke the Neutrality Act, so that China can continue to purchase arms from the United States, according to news from Tokyo, the Japanese naval authorities intend to implement a "wartime blockade" along the Chinese coast immediately after the declaration of war, and inspect ships from various countries, which the United States has consistently rejected. The possibility of a dispute between the United States and Japan has therefore increased. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>

<h3>Situation of French Naval and Air Force Expansion</h3>
<p>The Defense Line Is Very Solid</p>
<p>[Paris] Naval Minister Campinchi recently attended the Naval Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to report on the progress of naval shipbuilding. It is reported that the new 35,000-ton battleship "Jean Bart" will be completed in 1939, and the second battleship "Richelieu" will be completed in 1940. In addition, the air defense equipment of existing warships is also being actively strengthened. Generalissimo and Army Minister Daladier reported to the Army Committee of the Chamber of Deputies on the development of air force equipment and said that after the aircraft factories were nationalized, the results have been very positive and satisfactory, and both quality and quantity have improved. In addition, the training of air force personnel will also be intensified. When discussing the military situation in European countries, he said that he was very pleased after recently inspecting the "Maginot Line" on the eastern border. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<h3>Important Figure of the British Labour Party Goes to Spain</h3>
<p>To Study Whether Mediation Is Possible</p>
<p>[London] Major Attlee, leader of the Labour Party caucus in the House of Commons, left for Spain this evening via Paris to hold talks with the authorities of the Spanish Republican government. He is scheduled to make a brief stop in Paris to seek the opinions of key figures in the French Socialist Party. According to informed sources in the British Parliament, Major Attlee's trip is aimed at studying whether mediation is possible in the Spanish Civil War. Key figures in the British Labour Party also believe that the fighting on the various front lines in Spain has been relatively quiet recently, and other countries involved seem more concerned about the plan to withdraw volunteer soldiers. Therefore, under the current circumstances, not mediating is more convenient. However, those affiliated with both sides of the Spanish Civil War here remain skeptical about whether mediation will be effective, because people on the rebel side believe that the rebels have a military advantage and the government army will be forced to sue for peace, while people on the Republican government side say that the Spanish people would rather fight to the end than surrender to General Franco.

<h3>Russia and Germany Mutually Release Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Moscow] According to reliable sources, the Soviet Russian authorities have now handed over 42 German spies from the prisons in Kiev and Kharkov to Germany. At the same time, Germany has also handed over many Russian sailors captured by the Spanish rebel army to Russia. These German prisoners have now been led by the former Leningrad police force to be handed over to the German side. This kind of friendly gesture between Russia and Germany is the result of the tense situation in the Far East and the Soviet Union's attention turning to other matters.

<h3>Business Association of the Refugee Area Arranges Goods for Stores</h3>
<p>Voluntary in Nature and Does Not Charge Any Fees; Sets Up Order Monitors to Assist Authorities</p>
<p>The Business Association of the Refugee Area in Nanshi, Shanghai, accepted the request of merchants in the area. Chairman Shen XinFu set up arrangements to request the opening of the old North Gate iron gate from various relevant parties. In general, merchants who were displaced outside the area returned to the area one after another, eagerly seeking to resume business. However, due to the inconvenience of entering and exiting and the difficulty of arranging goods, the association selected Le Zixiang, Xian Guangsheng, Xue Shuling, and others to organize a goods arrangement committee to contact Father Zhao and various related parties. The association's purpose is to restore commerce and arrange goods. It is voluntary in nature and does not charge any fees. All stores in the area, whether they have resumed business or not, bring their store seals to the association registration office at the intersection of Minguo Road and Jiu Cang Street in the area to register. It is also reported that the association, in light of the winter defense emergency and the resumption of stores, selected several store representatives in the area who are over 30 years old and have lived there for more than three years, adopting the ancient system of mutual assistance and mutual watch among merchants, to serve as order monitors to assist the International Relief Committee and the French Concession authorities in resolving difficulties. If any unscrupulous people are encountered, they will be sent to the police authorities for strict handling. The association has been busy with affairs recently and plans to invite prominent Shanghai figure Wei Tingrong to serve as a director of the association, Pan Zhijie as an accountant, and Shen Qiuyan, etc., as association affairs consultants.</p>
<p>Food Rice Price Stabilization in the Refugee Area After the French Concession authorities allowed them to return to live, the number of residents in the Nanshi Refugee Area has gradually increased. In order to regulate the food supply for the residents, the International Relief Committee has established 27 price stabilization points in the area. Five of them started selling rice at stabilized prices yesterday. The temporary price for each bag is 16 yuan. It is also learned that food has been provided to the refugees in the area starting yesterday, with each refugee receiving five "he" (a unit of volume) per day. It is estimated that 400 bags of rice are needed per day. In order to maintain this for a long time, it is still hoped that people from all walks of life will donate various foods, such as salt, salted food, vegetables, fuel, etc., all of which are welcome.</p>
<p>More Refugees on the Streets Yesterday Although a portion of the iron gate at the old North Gate has been opened, and refugees from the Concession are allowed to pass through to the refugee area, passage from the refugee area into the Concession is still prohibited. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, when reporters from Da Tong News Agency separately observed the iron gates on Xin Qiao Street, Xin Old North Gate, and Xiao North Gate, the number of refugees wandering the streets in the Minguo Road area increased again. Some were carrying packages in their hands and carrying bedding on their shoulders, wandering the streets. There were also people talking with relatives on the Concession side across the iron gate. Observing their intentions, it seems that they are eager to reach the Concession, but it is so close yet so far, hopeful yet unattainable. The situation is miserable. The practice of throwing food from the iron gate has stopped, as this is enough to cause the refugees to riot and cause danger. There were also many vagrant refugees in the Fa Da Ma Road area in the past few days, but since a portion of the old North Gate was opened, these people seem to have automatically entered the refugee area to find shelter, so they are rarely seen on the streets.</p>
<p>Continued Sending Refugees Back to Their Hometowns Yesterday The Disaster Relief Committee Refugee Repatriation Committee of charitable organizations sent another 130 refugees from Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces yesterday morning, taking the Taikoo "WuXue" ship to return to their hometowns to make a living.</p>
<h3>Four Batches of 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Rice Merchants' Stock Was Sold Out Again Yesterday; Large Quantities of National Rice and Foreign Rice to Be Shipped Soon</p>
<p>—He DeKui Talks About the Municipal Council's Plan—</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council is cooperating with the South China Rice Industry Company to explore purchasing foreign rice. The fourth batch of 30,000 bags is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Various food groups have purchased national rice and ordered foreign rice, which has been loaded onto foreign ships in batches and will arrive in Shanghai soon. At the same time, they are trying their best to adjust food prices. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Four Batches Arriving in Shanghai The French trading company Da Fu Foreign Firm was entrusted by the Public Concession Municipal Council and the South China Rice Industry Company to order 115,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which were loaded onto foreign ships in four batches to be shipped to Shanghai. The fourth batch of 30,000 bags, loaded onto the British Taikoo Company's "Zhejiang" ship, was delayed until 1:00 PM today due to bad weather along the coast. The foreign firm has assigned personnel to handle the unloading of the goods after they arrive, to be collected by the Rice Merchants' Association and distributed to 500 member rice shops for retail sales.</p>
<p>National Rice and Foreign Rice In order to regulate the people's food supply, member rice shops of the Grains, Beans, and Rice Merchants' Association (1) purchased 300,000 "dan" (a unit of weight) of national rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo counties in Zhejiang province. Personnel have been dispatched to purchase them, and they can be loaded onto the British Taikoo Jardine Matheson companies' ships for shipment to Shanghai after the local county governments ask for instructions from the Zhejiang Provincial government. (2) The first batch of Saigon Annam foreign rice, about 30,000 bags, has been loaded onto the French mail ship "LiLuo" of the French Postal Company, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>Retail Sales The foreign rice that the Rice Merchants' Association received from the Public Concession Municipal Council and the South China Rice Industry Company, totaling 60,000 bags in the first, second, and third batches, was handed over to member rice shops for retail sales. Due to the market demand exceeding supply, it was sold out completely yesterday. The rice shops posted "Rice Sold Out" or "Waiting for Goods to Arrive" signs. It is expected that after the fourth batch of rice arrives in Shanghai today, retail sales can resume as usual tomorrow morning. A small number of restaurants have temporarily closed down due to rice depletion. The previously closed porridge shops can only resume business after the national rice arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>He's Talk Mr. He DeKui, Deputy Director of the Public Concession Municipal Council, met with Mr. Zhuang Ping, Chairman of the Shanghai West Union Welfare Association, yesterday morning to discuss the issue of regulating the people's food supply. The council has drafted a complete plan to dredge the source, and more rice and grain can be transported to Shanghai in the future. Mr. He first mentioned the incident of 40 bags of foreign rice being transported into MaoYiLi, ShanhaiGuan Road, on the 29th of last month. It has now been found out that it was applied for and collected by the Beans and Rice Industry Association on behalf of the rice shops, and prepared for the families of the staff, not within the scope of retail sales. However, it was not declared in advance, the investigation was clear, and no responsible person gave a definite answer, which caused many misunderstandings, and the outside world's speculation may have arisen because of this. Now that the matter has been investigated and clarified, there is no other fraudulent behavior, so it can be concluded. The Municipal Council authorities are very appreciative of the West Union Welfare Association's hard work in reporting and concern for the people's food supply. The Municipal Council's ears and eyes are not all-seeing, and if there are any issues that have not been handled properly, it is hoped that the association will continue to do its best to assist in the process. He then talked about the current method of rice shops distributing rice for retail sales, which is only an expedient measure and not a fundamental solution. The Municipal Council has now formulated a complete and concrete plan to do its best to find ways to dredge the source so that a large amount of rice and grain can be transported to Shanghai to provide relief. After the stock of rice is sufficient, the retail sales method will be cancelled immediately. The selling price can naturally fall, and the rice shops will not be able to manipulate and monopolize and raise prices. These groups will cooperate with various people's food-related groups. Regarding transportation, the Municipal Council authorities have already made practical solutions for any difficulties.</p>
<h3>Foreign Factories in Pudong Prepare to Resume Work</h3>
<p>After the war moved west, the tense situation in Shanghai gradually disappeared. The foreign factories in Pudong are preparing to resume work one after another. The reporter investigated from various sources yesterday. There are already more than 200 female workers in the Longmao warehouse in Lujiazui, picking flowers as usual. Every morning, they take small ferries from the Bund to the warehouse, and return to Shanghai on the original ferries in the evening. There are also ships berthing at the wharf, starting to load and unload cargo. The British LunChang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at the Fengshan Wharf also started work yesterday. However, the number of workers recruited is only two-thirds. They also enter and exit from the Bund. When the British YiZhong Cigarette Factory distributed relief funds yesterday, it officially announced that it would start work on the 6th of this month (next Monday). In addition to providing their own photos, workers do not need to wear uniforms. Workers will take tugboats and barges from the small wharf next to the Municipal Ferry Terminal at the south end of the Bund Park to enter the factory.</p>
<h3>News of the Resumption of Sino-British Liner Service</h3>
<p>The "Empress of Canada" Changed to Only Go to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Sino-British liner service of the British Shipping Company in this port was suspended after the outbreak of the war. Now that the front line has moved west, the company has decided to resume the Shanghai route. Starting from the 7th of this month, the first-class mail ship "Ran Ganpu Tai Nai" will start picking up passengers and loading cargo from Shanghai to London. The Changxing Company's "Empress of Canada", which sails in the Pacific Ocean, was originally scheduled to resume its Shanghai service on the 28th of last month. Unexpectedly, because various insurance companies believed that the Shanghai route was still not safe, they refused to allow it to resume service. Therefore, the company has completely cancelled the plan for the "Empress of Canada" to resume its Shanghai service and changed it to only go to Hong Kong to transfer passengers to and from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Pudong Transportation Still Not Restored</h3>
<p>Muller &amp; Co. et al. are Trying to Clear the Way</p>
<p>To facilitate the travel between Pudong and Puxi, British company Muller &amp; Co. and Italian company Hua Yi Co. have specially opened a temporary ferry service on the Huangpu River, which is very convenient for ordinary villagers and vegetable vendors. Since the Japanese side sealed off the ferry crossings at Yangjing and Donggou, transportation has relied solely on the Gaoqiao line. However, the Gaoqiao line is now also blocked, resulting in the complete disruption of transportation in Pudong. Villagers and vegetable vendors are all prevented from coming to Shanghai, causing a significant shortage of vegetable supplies. The two British and Italian shipping companies are currently trying to clear the way, hoping to resume ferry services as soon as possible so that villagers and vegetable vendors can travel freely. However, as of 6:00 PM yesterday, no ferry had resumed service, and a large number of vegetable vendors gathered at the Jianghai Customs Wharf to inquire about any news of ferry services. Only two or three small steam launches owned by various foreign firms are still operating to transport their staff, but they are not allowed to be used without a pass from the respective foreign firm. Currently, those who want to obtain news from Pudong can only rely on the small launches of Meifu Oil Depot, Texaco Oil Depot, Asia Oil Depot, and Lun Chang Printing and Dyeing Factory. Outside the Yangjingbang Bund, there is a small pier with rowboats and sampans that can cross to the Longmao Warehouse pier on the opposite bank. However, getting ashore at that pier poses another problem, and after getting ashore, one must pass through the Lanni Du town, which is extremely inconvenient along the way. Therefore, it is practically impossible to travel between Puxi and Pudong. It is now reported that a Czech merchant is organizing the "Welfare Transportation Company," which will be established within days. Once negotiations are completed, service will begin. It is planned to first open services to Gaoqiao and Donggou in Pudong, followed by Minhang and other places, following the previous routes of the municipal ferries, first carrying passengers and then cargo. Passengers from Shanghai will still embark and disembark at the original municipal ferry locations.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Continues to Solicit Blood</h3>
<p>According to records from the Public Works Department's Health Department, in the week before November 27th, 154 people in the concession died from measles. The department believes that injecting serum made from human blood into the body can prevent the disease or reduce its severity. It has been soliciting blood from the public specifically for the production of serum, to be used for injecting children in the refugee camps. However, to date, only 18 people have responded, including eight women and ten men, of whom six are employees of the Public Works Department's Health Department. It is estimated that there are at least 5,000 children under the age of five in the refugee camps within the concession, who are highly susceptible to contracting measles. If they become infected, their lives will be in grave danger. At most, half of the patients can be expected to recover. The incubation period of this disease is quite long, and it is easily transmitted, so even isolating patients cannot stop its gradual spread. However, injection with serum can save lives. Serum made from the blood of those who have previously had measles is especially effective. If 500 kind-hearted people are willing to donate blood (extracting 200 to 300 cc of blood from each person is sufficient to save ten children, and will not affect their health in any way), then all 5,000 children can be saved. The serum already produced has been used in various refugee camps within the Huishi District. The Public Works Department sincerely hopes that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically respond, so that the department can continue to produce serum for use in other refugee camps. (Blood collection locations: ① Office No. 102, Public Works Department, Hankou Road; ② Patrol Hospital No. 445, Shanhai Guan Road; Time: Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM; Saturday, 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM.)</p>
<h3>The 41st Aviation Lottery Tickets Will Not Be Drawn</h3>
<p>Ticket Holders Can Redeem in Full at the Three Banks</p>
<p>The 41st National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery, originally scheduled to be drawn publicly on December 3rd at the Yiyuan Garden on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, will now be suspended from the 41st issue onwards due to the current situation and obstacles in lottery operations, with approval from the office. All 41st issue lottery tickets can be redeemed in full at the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various locations for three months from December 11th, at the ticket price of ten yuan in national currency per ticket and one yuan in national currency per strip. Also, the Dayun Company has already announced to all ticket holders to redeem in full at the nearest Central, China, and Communications Banks.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Charcoal Allowed to Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, regarding the shortage of fuel in the city, sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday requesting permission to ship Wenzhou charcoal to Shanghai. The letter stated, "To the esteemed government, we hereby inform you that, based on the letter from the Charcoal Trade Association, our association previously, upon the request of members such as Mao Xing Xie Shun Xiang and other charcoal businesses, sent a letter on the 17th of this month to your esteemed office, requesting you to instruct the Yongjia County Government to allow charcoal merchants in that area to ship wood charcoal to Shanghai. We trust that this matter was promptly handled. Now, representatives dispatched by Yongjia charcoal merchants have come to Shanghai to report that the Yongjia County Government has not allowed the export of wood charcoal because it has not received a telegram from the provincial government. They request that we send another telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to appeal. Upon investigation, wood charcoal is a necessary fuel for Shanghai residents and has always been sourced from Zhejiang Province. Regarding the case of Mao Xing Xie Shun Xiang and others purchasing wood charcoal in Yongjia, our association previously sent a telegram to your office requesting that the county be instructed to allow the shipment, but because the original document was sent to the provincial capital in Hangzhou, and the situation is serious, communication is obstructed, and it may not have reached the Yongjia County Government in time to comply, resulting in the inability to export the wood charcoal procured by the businesses. Currently, fuel in Shanghai, like food, is causing panic. Our association, being the leader of commercial organizations, has the inescapable responsibility to regulate the market. The businesses now plan to raise funds and send personnel to Yongjia to purchase 40,000 dan of wood charcoal, to be shipped in batches to Shanghai for sale. In addition to issuing certificates from our association proving that the two batches of goods are indeed for supplying fuel to residents, we earnestly request that you promptly telegraph Yongjia County to allow the export of the batches of wood charcoal procured by Shanghai charcoal merchants, which would truly be in the spirit of public service."</p>
<h3>Increasing Number of Taverns on Jing'an Temple Road</h3>
<p>Public Works Department Does Not Impose Restrictions, But Each Case Must Be Individually Considered</p>
<p>The number of taverns in the Jing'an Temple Road area is increasing daily. There are now as many as forty-one licensed establishments. Recently, more liquor merchants have planned to add four more in the area and have applied to the Public Works Department for business licenses. The Public Works Department's Security Committee believes that an excessive number of taverns in a residential area is inappropriate. Therefore, at the last meeting, this issue was raised for discussion. It was decided that there would be no fixed limit on the number of taverns in the Jing'an Temple Road area. However, in the future, if anyone applies to establish a new one, their application must be considered on a case-by-case basis. As for the four applications that have already been submitted, one of them (No. 1525 Jing'an Temple Road) will not be allowed to open due to the unsuitable location. The other three will be allowed to operate if they comply with the conditions set by the Public Works Department. This resolution has been approved by the department's board of directors.</p>
<h3>Repatriation of Overseas Chinese Returning from Japan Continues</h3>
<p>Taking the Wuhu Steamer to Transfer Home</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese who returned from Japan on the French mail steamer Aramis a few days ago, except for the twelve from Zhejiang, who boarded the Haiping Steamer to Ningbo to return to their hometowns, also included one each from Shandong and Jiangsu. A certain organization arranged to purchase ship tickets and sent them to board the Wuhu Steamer departing from Shanghai to Tongzhou today, so that they could return to their original homes.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Association Held Regular Meeting of Member Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association held its 26th regular meeting of member representatives of the third session at its office on Ningbo Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from 46 firms including Fu Yuan, Zhen Tai, Tong Yu, Bao Feng, and Hong Sheng, namely Xu Wenqing, Yan Dayou, and Shen Jingliang, were present, chaired by Liu Wuqiao and recorded by Ge Huaiqing. After the chairman's report, the November interbank interest rate was discussed, and a rate of 4.5% was decided. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Xin Yong'an Automatically Sinks</h3>
<p>Portuguese Merchants' Five Small Steamers Detained, Not Yet Released Today</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the five small steamers of the Portuguese merchant De Qi Company have not been released after being detained by the Japanese side. Although the Portuguese consulate negotiated with the Japanese side for their release, the company stated that it was said that they could be released yesterday. Yesterday, inquiries were made again to the company, and it was learned that the above-mentioned detained steamers had not yet been returned, and it seems that there is still some waiting to be done. Also, of the small steamers in the Suzhou Creek that have not been detained, only one, the Xin Yong'an, remains. The steamer was usually docked under the North Shanxi Road Bridge. It is now learned that the steamer automatically sank at its original mooring place yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>German Tugboats Confiscated by Japan Have Been Returned</h3>
<p>National Maritime News Agency's Shanghai report states that the two German tugboats confiscated by Japan on the 17th of last month have been returned to their owners after days of negotiations between the German and Japanese authorities. This morning, in the presence of representatives from the German Consul-General, the Japanese Embassy, Japanese naval officers, and representatives from the German shipping company, the German flag was once again raised on the two tugboats.</p>
<h3>Post-Shutdown Salary Supplements for Municipal Government Are Untrue</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that yesterday's local newspapers reported that various Shanghai municipal government agencies were giving staff two months' salary as severance pay. According to reliable sources obtained by reporters, it may be true that central government agency staff are receiving two months' severance pay. As for the municipal agencies, since the "August 13th" incident, the city's tax revenues have completely stopped. Expenses for September and October were entirely dependent on central government subsidies. In November, the central government only provided a small subsidy, which was insufficient for distribution. Even the salaries of the police have not been issued. The financial difficulties are self-evident. Therefore, the municipal government's request to issue severance pay to dismissed staff is truly beyond its means. Therefore, the report that two months' severance pay would be issued is untrue.</p>

<h3>Weekly Red Cross Donation Drive – 500 Female Students Mobilize to Plead for Refugees</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Yuan Raised Yesterday Through Street Collections – Benefit Performance Planned in the Near Future</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross Society believes that the refugees sheltered by various charitable organizations in the city urgently need relief in this severe winter season. It has initiated a plan to raise 10 million yuan from the world to be used for the next six months. It is now actively underway. In addition to telegraphing charitable organizations and kind-hearted individuals around the world to generously donate and support it, it is also promoting a large-scale fundraising campaign in the city, with the aim of raising 100,000 yuan. Yesterday was the second day of "Red Cross Fundraising Week." All the street fundraising teams jointly organized by Weixin, Zhongxi, Peicheng, Moore Memorial, and the Public Works Department Girls' School continued to set off yesterday to conduct fundraising in the bustling areas of the two concessions. All team members wore white nurse uniforms, with a red cross pinned on their chests and gauze caps, and carried specially made donation tubes. They fundraised along the streets with amiable manners. People from all walks of life, recognizing the urgent need to save the disaster victims, donated enthusiastically. Therefore, the fundraising results yesterday were quite impressive, reaching over 10,000 yuan. In addition, to increase the interest of donors, the society has specially produced exquisite calendars and Red Cross commemorative badges to give to donors. Starting yesterday, the society has also posted extremely eye-catching slogans in key areas and on buses and trams, such as "Three yuan a month can save a life," which has attracted the attention of pedestrians. It is now learned that the society is also negotiating with various theaters to arrange benefit performances to raise funds.</p>

<h3>Recent Status of Various Shipping Lines Between Shanghai and the Interior</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Carries Passengers Only, Stops Loading Cargo – Shanghai-Ningbo, Dinghai, Taizhou Lines Operate as Usual – Chongming-Ruifengsha Line About to Open</p>
<p>The only means of maintaining water transportation between Shanghai and the interior are the Shanghai-Tongzhou, Shanghai-Ningbo, Dinghai, Taizhou, and the recently opened Ruifengsha lines by British company Muller &amp; Co. However, fares are several times higher than usual. The recent situation of the above shipping lines is investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tongzhou Line Stops Loading Cargo The shipping lines operating between Shanghai and Tongzhou are British company Taikoo, Jardine, and Italian company Hua Yi Shipping Company, with ships such as Wuhu, Wuxue, Tonghe, Pinghe, and Ende regularly traveling back and forth, handling joint passenger and cargo transport and mail with ships on the Yangtze River. It is the only transportation line since the shift in the war situation. Therefore, every time it sails, cargo is crowded, and fares skyrocket. The fares are: ⑴ Shanghai to Tongzhou, volume per ton 40 cubic feet, and weight per ten quintals, totaling 2,000 catties, fare is 11 yuan in national currency. ⑵ Shanghai to Hankou, volume per ton 40 cubic meters, and weight per ten quintals totaling 2,000 catties, fare is 45 yuan in national currency (fares to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, etc. above Tongzhou are calculated as Hankou). Due to the excessive accumulation of goods waiting to be transported to various ports on the Yangtze River from Tongzhou, and the limited capacity of barge transfers on the Tongzhou-Zhenjiang section, Taikoo and Jardine are now temporarily stopping loading cargo on the Wuhu, Wuxue, Pinghe, and Tonghe steamers from Shanghai to Tongzhou, and only carrying passengers in order to clear the accumulated cargo. Hua Yi Company's Ende steamer has also stopped loading cargo to ports above Tongzhou after returning to Shanghai with the cargo it previously loaded.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Line Operates on Schedule The only steamer currently operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line is Hua Yi Shipping Company's De Ping steamer. The line was previously ordered to suspend operations by the Ningbo Defense Command due to the closure of the Yong River due to the war. After the Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association requested permission to resume operations, the De Ping steamer has now resumed its regular schedule between Shanghai and Ningbo, carrying passengers and cargo. The De Ping steamer departed from Jinliyuan Wharf to Ningbo at 3:00 PM yesterday, and passengers were still very crowded. The British company Shenfu Steamer, which operates to Dinghai and Taizhou, is scheduled to depart at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Chongming Line About to Open The new shipping line opened by British company Muller Shipping Company, from Shanghai directly to Ruilaisha at the mouth of the Yangtze River, its first voyage sailed a few days ago. It is now learned that Taikoo Steamer Company is also planning to open a Shanghai Chongming line to carry passengers and cargo, and has dispatched the Xiushan steamer, which has already started selling passenger tickets. The date of its first voyage to Chongming is scheduled for the 3rd or 4th.</p>
<p>Portuguese Shipping Merchant Negotiates for Detained Ships The five small steamers that the Portuguese merchant De Qi Company purchased from various inland river steamer bureaus have been dragged away. After repeated negotiations by the Portuguese side, it was said that they could be returned yesterday. The reporter from New Voice News Agency went to the company yesterday to investigate. The dragged-away steamers have not been returned. However, according to company personnel, the company's general manager, Mr. Goethe, is continuing to negotiate. The only remaining steamer in Suzhou Creek, the Xin Yong'an, sank near Pantang Bridge a few days ago due to damage.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Minhang</h3>
<p>Local Conditions Gradually Stabilizing – Japanese Army Pays Respect to Li Yingshi's Tomb</p>
<p>After Mr. Tang of the Free Profession Weavers Union established temporary maintenance in Minhang Town, Shanghai County, the local situation has gradually stabilized. Shops in the town have also resumed business one after another. It is now learned that the house of the town chief, surnamed Wu, has been set up as a headquarters, Zhang Boliang's residence is a supply station, and the orphanage is a hospital for wounded soldiers. There are currently about 200 wounded soldiers. Several trucks are parked at the Shanghai-Minhang Bus Station, traveling back and forth day and night, transporting supplies frequently. Seven or eight submarines are parked in the Huangpu River, and transport boats loaded with military supplies frequently drive to Minhang and transfer to the supply station, which is extremely busy. Temporary maintenance has set up an office in the town hall. Li Yuan in the town is the tomb of the late Lieutenant General Li Yingshi. The firm monument inscription states that he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy. Therefore, Japanese soldiers passing by salute the portrait and pay their respects. The Japanese Command has also issued instructions to strictly protect it.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police in Pudong Completely Withdrawn, Japanese Navy Deploys</h3>
<p>Puppet Police Concentrated for Training</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain person escaped from a ferry crossing in Laiyi Ferry, Pudong, by rowboat, and spoke about the recent situation in Pudong. According to reports, after the Japanese army stationed there was transferred away on the 29th of last month, the navy in black woolen uniforms took over the defense that night, stationed in several places including Tianzhang Paper Mill in Lujiazui, the Chen family in Yangjiazhai, the Lin family at the west end of the Pudong YMCA, the Zhang family in front of the Pudong Branch Bureau, and Hongsheng Warehouse in Laiyi Ferry. They distributed posts on the main streets and roads, with three people per post. The police who had resumed their duties were ordered to withdraw on the 30th. Except for a small number patrolling in various places every day, the majority were concentrated in the Pudong Branch Bureau, Chen's Primary School, Pudong Hospital, and the YMCA, totaling about 500 people. They trained on the YMCA grounds twice a day, morning and afternoon. The instructors were also Chinese, and the training style was the same as in our country, but it was exceptionally strict. More than a dozen policemen deserted due to physical exhaustion. After the Japanese discovered this, they now send personnel to take roll call at irregular intervals every day, as many as three or four times. The police's salary is divided into three levels: 22 yuan, 24 yuan, and 26 yuan. The police chiefs are also divided into three levels: 30 yuan, 34 yuan, and 38 yuan. The inspector receives 80 yuan. He works as a laborer in the branch bureau, earning half a yuan per day. Yesterday (the 1st) was the first day of salary payment, and the chiefs and police had received half a month's pay. He did not know why, but he only received five yuan, so he angrily left. He also said that the Japanese Navy is stricter than the Army. When landing, they arrested more than 60 civilians deemed suspicious in various places and detained them in the Cundedang Pharmacy opposite the Pudong Bank. More than 20 of them were coolies from a certain warehouse, so they were released on bail. The rest are still not released. In the past two days, many more people have been arrested, totaling more than 200 civilians. This morning, they were all transferred to the Dachang Paper Mill for interrogation. How to dispose of them is still unknown. At present, it is desolate, and no maintenance committee has been established. The rumors about so-and-so and so-and-so are not true.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Announcement on Anti-Theft Measures</h3>
<p>Hoping for Resident Cooperation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department Police Department, due to the frequent armed robbery cases in the concession recently, has specifically set out two measures for prevention, and specially issued and posted announcements yesterday, and distributed the measures to households. The announcement is as follows: "Announcement: It has been found that there have been frequent armed robbery cases in this concession recently. Although this department has arrested many bandits and punished them according to law, the police also have difficulties in handling the cases. Residents need to help each other. The measures are divided into two points as follows: ⑴ When armed robbers enter the house, servants often open the door and enter through the front and back doors. Residents must not open the door to allow strangers to enter. ⑵ It has been found that the robbed residents often do not dare to sound the alarm. Sometimes, when armed robbers are present, it is difficult to sound the alarm. But once the alarm is sounded, the robbers will flee immediately. It must be known that robbers are not brave people. The reason they dare to rob is because residents are cowardly and allow them to rob. Now, let me ask you, if you do not speak up and sound the alarm, how can the police arrest the robbers? If you unfortunately encounter armed robbers in the future, you should immediately sound the alarm, shout loudly, or sound the whistle, or strike the gong, or press the alarm bell, or use other methods, so that neighbors and patrolmen can pay attention. This is a special announcement. All residents are requested to be aware of this. This is the announcement. December 1st, 26th Year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>One-Dime Donation Actively Promoted by All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>The International Relief Society is promoting a one-dime donation campaign every day to provide relief to refugees. Companies, businesses, and households are enthusiastically participating. Yesterday, the following donations were received: 47 yuan and 1.5 dimes from the staff of China Soap Company, 54 yuan from Shen Chengxiang Paper Store, 18 yuan from Jingxingxuan Cao, 12 yuan from Jin Qinxiang Paper Store, 10 yuan from Cai Ji Timber Company, 9 yuan and 6 dimes from the staff of Jiu Feng Silk Store, 37 yuan from Yao Songru, 15 yuan from Mrs. Tong, 15 yuan from Dong Cui Ting, 15 yuan from Li Nengcai, 12 yuan from Yu Wenqi, and 6 yuan from Lu Yiting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Nanshi Chinese Merchant Tramway Employees Issue Relief Funds</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Chinese Merchant Tramway Company stopped operating after the Shanghai war. Manager Lu Bohong had been paying half of the salaries to the employees every month. A temporary office was set up in front of the Nanyang Bridge iron gate every day. After the fall of Nanshi, the entire Nanshi area was scorched earth, but the tramway company was able to maintain its integrity. However, it was temporarily unable to resume operations. Therefore, the board of directors decided yesterday that the relief funds will be issued as follows: those with a salary of 30 yuan or less will receive 15 yuan per month, those with a salary of 50 yuan or less will receive 20 yuan per month, and those with a salary exceeding 50 yuan, whether it is 200 or 300 yuan, will all receive 30 yuan per month, for a period of three months. At that time, it will be resolved separately depending on changes in the environment. However, employees are still demanding an increase in the amount of relief funds.</p>
<h3>Fire in Nanshi Re-ignites</h3>
<p>Fires Raging in Dafang Lane and Wengjia Lane – Refugee Area Has Fire Protection, Not Yet Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday, from morning to night, Nanshi was burning all day long. There were no less than a dozen fires of varying sizes. In the morning, the area near the Guandi Temple in Laoximen was burning the most severely, with thick smoke surging into the sky. The fire burned more and more fiercely and did not subside into the night. Red light filled the sky, and tongues of fire flickered and spread in all directions. The fire has now split into two locations. One location is burning westward, having already reached the Ximenkou. The Ximen Department Store is already on fire. The other location is burning northward towards Dafang Lane and Wengjia Lane. These areas are all residential areas, with many alleys, all narrow lanes, tightly packed, making it difficult to extinguish the fire on its own. Before noon, a large fire also broke out at the entrance of Shipi Lane on Fangbang Road (in front of Guangfu Temple) outside the refugee area. The flames rushed straight towards the northern refugee area with great force. It gradually died down around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Fortunately, the refugee area fire brigade was prepared early, and it was not affected. However, along the way, countless houses were burned down. Xuenongdi Street, Guoyutang Street, and Taosha Market in the rear of Nanfangbang Road were the most severe. Minor fires in areas such as Kangqu Road in Rihuigang, outside Hunan, and the roads and Zhonghua Road inside Xiaodongmen were completely extinguished by noon. The fires in the Zhongshan Road area in western Shanghai have mostly been extinguished. There were no more flames to be seen last night. As for the areas around Dananmen and Xiaoximen reported in the evening newspapers last night, there were no reports of fires or flames seen yesterday. Also, a fire broke out near the China Bank on Dongmen Road outside Xiaodongmen at around 9:30 PM the night before, burning straight from Dong Street to Jukui Street and Fangbang Road. The victims included Jingye Middle School and Wang Dayou Copperware Store. The fire only began to subside yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Water Cut Off in Aike Area Has Not Yet Been Restored</h3>
<p>Citizens Branch in the Area Sends Letter to General Assembly Requesting Negotiation</p>
<p>The citizens branch of Aike Area, North District, Public Concession, sent a letter to the General Assembly yesterday, stating, "Upon investigation, residents in the Suzhou Creek North District, who had previously taken refuge south of Suzhou Creek due to the tense situation in Zhabei, have been returning in large numbers recently, and order is gradually being restored. However, because the arrears of rent have not been resolved, areas such as Gaoshou Lane, Jiu'an Lane, Changqing Lane, Fushou Lane, and Wanxiang Lane north of Aierjin Road have not yet been restored after being cut off from water, causing great inconvenience to the returning residents. It is believed that drinking water is necessary for citizens' daily use. If the stalemate continues for a long time, it will definitely affect public security. For the sake of social order and the lives of citizens, our association hereby requests your esteemed assembly to negotiate for the restoration as soon as possible. This is what we hope for."</p>
<h3>Pickled Mustard Greens Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Vegetable Supply Still Lacking</p>
<p>Since transportation to Pudong was disrupted, Pudong vegetables could not be supplied to the market, causing vegetable prices to rise again for days. However, according to what reporters have learned, a batch of pickled mustard greens from Taihu Lake arrived in Shanghai yesterday. However, the number was only three or four hundred dan. According to the person transporting the vegetables, a total of twelve ships were loaded with pickled mustard greens to Shanghai. They encountered dangers along the way and were detained for a week after arriving in Shanghai. Therefore, the vegetables were mostly yellow in color. Also, Ningbo and Guangdong radishes have also arrived in Shanghai recently, but the number is also very small. Therefore, the vegetable supply is obviously lacking, and it is difficult to expect market prices to fall immediately.</p>
<h3>Imported Foreign Ships Still Pay Customs Duties</h3>
<p>Customs has already issued customs declarations; customs duties are still managed by Customs.</p>
<p>The issue of the Japanese takeover of the Jianghai Customs has not been implemented due to international relations. The British ship "Greenflas," which arrived yesterday, and the "Tai Yang" ship, which arrived in Shanghai on Sunday, must both enter the Huangpu River to load and unload goods. All customs declarations for shipments have been issued by Customs, and the import and export duties payable are still managed by the Jianghai Customs. Yesterday, various foreign shipping companies followed their usual procedures, obtained number slips from Customs, and paid their taxes.</p>

<h3>Distributing Low-Priced Rice, Forty Bags Short</h3>
<p>While reporting to the police, they were suddenly attacked by hoodlums; Liu Longxiang was detained pending investigation and interrogation.</p>
<p>Previously, due to the lack of food in the city, the Municipal Council, together with the South China Rice Company, purchased a large quantity of Saigon rice and distributed it to various rice shops for retail. Each shop received forty bags. When receiving the rice, the Rice Trade Association sent personnel to distribute it based on slips. Liu Longxiang, Zhou Guangcheng, and Deng Fucheng were employees dispatched by the Association to the Bund branch of the Bank of China to manage the rice distribution. On July 27th, when Zhou and Deng went to the Bund at 4:00 PM, Liu had already finished distributing the rice. At that time, a representative from Xin Cheng Rice Shop at 532 White Crane Road came with a slip to collect forty bags of rice, but the rice had already been distributed and not actually received, resulting in a shortage of forty bags of white rice. Zhou and Deng believed that Liu should be held responsible, so at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, they accompanied Liu Longxiang to the Rice Trade Association at No. 51, Lane 153, Shanhai Pass Road, to meet with Chairman Fu Qiangeng. Liu left the association after arriving, but returned shortly. Chairman Fu decided that the matter should be reported to the police for a thorough investigation. So Liu, Zhou, and Deng left the association together, intending to go to the police station. Unexpectedly, just as they exited the association, more than twenty hoodlums rushed forward and severely beat Zhou and Deng, causing injuries to Zhou's left waist and Deng's body. Police officer No. 772 arrived and arrested Jiang A'gen, a native of Jiangbei, who was committing the assault on the spot, and took him to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyers Jiang Baolian and Zhang Shizhu filed charges based on Article 277 of the Criminal Law, stating that it was urgently necessary to investigate whether Liu Longxiang had instigated the assault and how the forty bags of white rice, worth about 700 yuan, were short, and whether there was any corruption. They requested a postponement. Judge Meng questioned them and approved a postponement for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Two More Gangs of Thieves Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>A gateman's pistol was discovered.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Public Concession police authorities have spared no effort in investigating and arresting bandits hiding within the concession. Many thieves have been apprehended by various police stations, and many modern weapons have also been seized. Yesterday, two more gangs of thieves were arrested. ⑴ Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Detective Song Bingzheng, Detective Zhang Changgui, and others from the General Inspectorate arrested five Jiangbei natives, Xu Henian, Tang Jiyun, Wu Hongbin, Wu Yongshou, and Chen Shuanglin, at No. 20, Lane 524, Edward Road, inside the Australia Hotel. They seized a pistol, five bullets, and a fake pistol. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Special Court No. 1, and police lawyer Li Zhishan requested permission to detain them. ⑵ Thieves Jin Songhai, a native of Pudong, and Zhang Jinshan, a native of Shandong, were caught with a pistol and five bullets at No. 28 Kangjia Bridge. It was discovered that the gun belonged to Li Yingshun, gateman No. 2374 of the Municipal Council, who had lent it to Jin and others. The detectives then went and arrested Li. Later, it was found that Chen Xiantian, gateman No. 1225, had also lent the pistol used for his service to Jin and other criminals, so he was also arrested. Yesterday morning, they were also sent to Special Court No. 1, and police lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xunjiu requested detention for investigation of the crimes. After interrogation by Judges Feng and Dai, both cases were approved for detention and postponement for further investigation.</p>
<h3>A Stray Bullet Hit While Casually Looking on the Street</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday, many villagers were standing near the electric pole in front of Yang Baokang Rice Shop on Haig Road in Xujiahui, Shanghai, seeking refuge and talking. Unexpectedly, a stray bullet suddenly struck a villager, about thirty years old, in the foot, causing a torrent of blood. The bullet had not yet been removed. The French police arrived and took the injured person to the Red Cross for treatment.</p>
<h3>News from the Fengjing Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association</h3>
<p>Since Fengjing was occupied, Ma Shouliang, a fellow villager in Shanghai, returned to Fengjing to visit. He has recently returned to Shanghai. According to him, the places bombed in Fengjing were the railway station, the Ruan family, the Xie family, the Fengjing Town Public Security Bureau of Jiashan County, the upper and lower sections of Xishengjia Bridge, the main street from Shengtang Bridge to Xinjiekou, the area around Beifeng Bridge and Shigulong, Dongzha, and Lujiahui. Houses near the city river were collapsed by the bombing. All houses that were not bombed were left with their doors open, without exception. Many residents fled west. He met fellow villagers Li Xuecheng, Li Binyin, Wang Youchen, Tao Disheng, and others in Wuzhen. He heard that fellow villagers were also taking refuge in towns such as Xinshi, Shuanglin, and Linghu. Cai Yuanzhai, along with his eighty-year-old grandmother and more than ten family members, men and women, and their relatives Chen Bonian and his family, fled to the countryside of Xincheng Town, Jiaxing. They sent a letter to relatives in Shanghai, but it took more than three weeks to arrive. Now that the war has moved west, it is unknown where they have fled to. Therefore, their relatives in Shanghai hope that fellow villagers in Fengshan who know of their whereabouts will notify them to find a way to go to Ningbo and then to Shanghai, as only the Shanghai-Ningbo ships are still sailing normally.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Live Pigs Arrived in Port</h3>
<p>More will arrive in the future; there will be no more worries about shortages.</p>
<p>Since the "August 13th" incident, there has been a shortage of rice and food in the city. The transportation of cattle, sheep, and pork has also been obstructed, resulting in high market prices. The Fresh Pig Trade Association has tried to adjust the situation, and a large batch of live pigs was shipped from Nantong and other places yesterday. They were transported by trucks to the 殺 Cattle Company on Avenue Monteverdi in the French Concession in the morning and afternoon. It is said that more will arrive in the future, so there will be no more worries about shortages.</p>
<h3>Dressed as a Woman for Fifteen Years Without Being Discovered</h3>
<p>Worked as a maid without any impropriety; recently discovered due to illness in the hospital.</p>
<p>—Released after a reprimand from the court—</p>
<p>Zhao Jinbao, a young man from Suzhou, is twenty-five years old. With his delicate features and slim figure, he had the bizarre idea of dressing as a woman. After dressing up, he looked just like a slender woman. A month ago, through an introduction agency, he was introduced to work as a maid at the Sheng residence at No. 1 Yongcun, Avenue Petain in the French Concession. The day before yesterday, Zhao Jinbao suddenly suffered from typhoid fever. His employer sent him to the China Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road for treatment in the inpatient ward. Unexpectedly, the doctor discovered the ruse and found two fake breasts on his chest. He immediately notified his employer by telephone and reported it to the French police station. Detectives were dispatched to the hospital to investigate and took Zhao Jinbao to the police station. The police chief questioned him about why he was disguised as a woman. Zhao replied that his parents had passed away when he was ten years old. He came to Shanghai from his hometown with an old woman. Forced by livelihood and because it was difficult to make a living in Shanghai, the old woman taught him to disguise himself as a woman. He first worked as a senior maid at the Zhu residence on Liaoyang Road in the Public Concession for ten years. After a break, he worked at the Tang residence on Seymour Road for two years, and then transferred to the Sun residence on Rue Bourgeat, also for three years. He has been a domestic helper for fifteen years. Recently, he started working at the Sheng residence on Avenue Petain. He had never been discovered because he was forced by livelihood to come up with this plan to make a living. Since becoming a domestic worker, he had never done anything illegal or out of line, and had always been law-abiding. He asked for leniency. The police chief verified his words and reported them to his employer. Since the employer did not want to investigate further, considering that Zhao had not committed any illegal acts, he was leniently dismissed and ordered to correct his attire from now on and not to engage in any frivolous behavior. Otherwise, he would be arrested and severely punished. Zhao obediently complied and left.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Urges Members to Collect Licenses</h3>
<p>The Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association previously issued a notice to all members to donate and collect licenses. From December, each vehicle would cost a total of three yuan, one jiao, and nine fen, including mutual aid fees and association fees. As the deadline is approaching, all members are urged to pay within the time limit so that they can collect their licenses and operate before the 6th of this month to avoid penalties from the Municipal Council for withholding licenses.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Education Committee Reviews Subsidies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Education Committee decided at its meeting on the 19th of last month to recommend to the Council a decision to establish two special committees (as subcommittees of the Education Committee) to review applications for school subsidies for 1938. The proposed members of each committee are as follows: Foreign Schools: Bodde, Belsen, Yamamoto, and Mrs. Whitehorn; Chinese Schools: Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Xi Yushu, Chen Jicheng, Tang Guoxun, Wei Pengdan, Liao Shicheng, and Mrs. Xia Jinlin. The members of the committee for reviewing applications from foreign schools are all reappointed from the previous session, except for Dr. Thomson, who has left Shanghai and been replaced by Belsen. Of the eleven original members of the committee for reviewing applications from Chinese schools, eight are reappointed from the previous session, and Tang Guoxun is a new appointee. There are still two vacancies, and it is currently planned not to appoint additional members to fill them. Because the committee has too many members, and the number of schools applying for subsidies will inevitably be reduced due to the war, the committee may as well reduce its organization. The Municipal Council resolved at its meeting on December 1 to approve the proposed arrangements.</p>
<h3>Zhonghua Middle School Opens an Economics Class</h3>
<p>Zhonghua Primary and Middle School, located at the intersection of Qipu Road and Gansu Road, previously moved south to Junle Village on Avenue Edward VII due to its proximity to the war zone. Recently, as the war has shifted west, students' families have been moving back one after another. In order to help the general out-of-school children, the school has opened an economics class at its original address on Qipu Road, in addition to continuing classes as usual on Avenue Edward VII. Classes are held for eight hours a day, and there are no holidays on Sundays. The monthly tuition fee is only one yuan for primary school and two yuan for middle school. The aim is to complete a semester's worth of work at the lowest possible price and in the shortest possible time with redoubled efforts. It is said that many people have been rushing to register and enroll in recent days.</p>
<h3>A Fire Destroyed Wujia Lane on the Shanghai-Minhang Road</h3>
<p>There are more than a hundred houses in Wujia Lane on the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus route. Shanghai Private Middle School is also located here, so the Shanghai-Minhang Company has a station to facilitate transportation. It is learned that the station was burned down long ago, and the houses in the Wujia Lane market at the southern end also caught fire and burned down completely a few days ago. The fire also affected the teachers' dormitories and classroom buildings of the middle school. The total loss is truly substantial.</p>
<h3>French Barracks to Auction Off Old Items</h3>
<p>The French barracks will auction off a pile of old items on Monday, December 13th, at 10:00 AM inside the French barracks at 691 Route Frelupt. Those who wish to purchase can inquire about details at the military supply office of the French barracks at 75 Route Frelupt from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM daily (except holidays), and view the goods inside 691 Route Frelupt from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>"Niuzhuang" Ship Arrived with 3,000 Tons of Hongji Coal</h3>
<p>Unloading has begun.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the British Swire Shipping Company's "Niuzhuang" ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday morning, carrying 3,000 tons of Hongji coal. It docked at the Swire Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession and began unloading at around 10:00 AM. The cargo owners are transporting it by trucks to coal yards in the concession for storage.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Crushed to Death by Car</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a yellow truck with license plate number 17010, driven by a driver heading from east to west along Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, unexpectedly struck a man, about thirty years old, wearing a blue long gown and resembling a refugee, near the east side of the Ta Kung Pao newspaper office. The wheels ran over his head, and his brains splattered, killing him instantly. The street police took the driver to the police station for questioning. After photographing the body, it was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan temporary morgue for examination.</p>
<h3>Gu Yulin Seeks Father and Wife</h3>
<p>Gu Yongxun and his daughter-in-law, Gu Liu, were residing on Shantang Street in Suzhou. There has been no news from them for months, and their fate is unknown. Their son, Gu Yulin, currently residing at No. 36 Renji Lane, Xinzha Road (telephone 30915), is searching everywhere to reunite with them.</p>
<h3>Seeking News of Wuxi</h3>
<p>Xu Qin'sun is originally from Liangxi and lives in Shegangli, outside the North Gate. Lately, there have been many war reports, and he is deeply concerned about the safety of his hometown. He hopes that fellow villagers in Shanghai who know the latest news of his hometown can contact him in person at the cashier's room of the Sutai Hotel on Fourth Avenue, or call 94736.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read in your newspaper that I returned to Songjiang yesterday. This is not true. I am still residing in Shanghai. Please make the correction. Sincerely, Zhu Jiuwang, December 2nd.</p>
