<h3>旅歐隨筆</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>二十二　德國報紙的邏輯的</p>
<p>德國宣傳部部長哥白爾司博士生平最得意的一點，就是在他指揮之下德國報紙的論調已經淸一色化。報紙應該是黨并政府的工具，這是國社黨的新聞政策。國社黨人特別覺得驕傲的地方，在於德國的報紙已皆“獨樹一幟，不與別國的報紙一樣，隨波逐污”，專門登載一股不道德的新聞。換句話，德國報紙的德道標準已經提高了起來。</p>
<p>例如去年冬天英王愛德華第八同他一位美國籍已經結過婚的女友戀愛，為了這個事件與首相鮑爾溫發生衝突。關於這種新聞各國的報紙，甚至於英國的報紙都大登特登。例外的只有德國的報紙。德國各報都刋載了一個啟事，說明這個事件是英國的內政問題。德國報紙不願意干涉別國的內政，所以對於這個新聞只好割愛。於是乎自始至終不提隻字，一直到愛德華第八遜位以後，許多報級當天才連忙發行號外，雖然到這一天大部分德國人民已知道這一段故事。</p>
<p>相反的，是西安事變。當將介石先生被留後，德報卽根據日本同盟社的消息，說他已經被害。另一面硬主張學良先生是共產黨。於是借題發揮，在中國人的賬上去攻擊共產黨。一種論調，無異替日本的遠東政策聲辯。等到蔣介石先生無恙歸來，中國人民在全世界入士館證明了中國是一個統一的國家。這時候德國報紙一部份改變了原來的態度，可是一部分却仍說，中國人是看重面子的。社次蔣介石先生失了面子（？）他的地位已經動搖？所以中國的前途未可樂觀。甚至於說，蔣介石先生的請假，純粹為了面子問題。事實上，我們中國人目前大家十分明白本國國離的嚴重并統一的需要。經過西安事變以後，蔣介石先生不但沒有丟掉“面子”，相反的，他在人民間的聲譽只有增高。因為中國需嬰蔣介石先生。中國人民此日所以愛護的并不是介石先生個人，而是千辛萬苦所換來的統一局面。</p>
<p>其實西安事件正是中國的內政問題。假如德國報紙肯維持自己一貫的主張，不去干涉別國的內政，那末不但社論文章應該有另外的一種態度，甚至於根本就不應該做日本同盟社的留聲機。尤其是明函新消息報上的論調。我們覺得，該報每次對於中日事件的言論總比日本人還要日本化。這也許是德國人爽直的地方！</p>
<p>二十三　我們所不敢說</p>
<p>在歐洲人眼中，咱們中國人自然是一個不可了解的民族，同樣的，中國的風俗習慣也是一個無法猜破的謎。反過來說，由我們中國人看來歐洲也有許多事情是不可思議的。例如歐洲人的家庭觀念。</p>
<p>新近認識了一個家庭，父親是一個工廠廠主，母親是個再嫁了的寡婦。她的第一次婚姻有了兩個兒子。歷來這兩位也跟着他們的後父一起生活。母親的第一次婚姻却單生一位女兒。一位年紀十八歲生得十分體面的姑娘。雖說父親還五十歲不到，擁有十分壯健的體格。可是在母女間却已常争論到遺產問題。而且當着父親面前</p>
<p>有一次這個家庭舉行了一個小宴會，記者也是客人之一。席散後，大家坐着談天。無意中忽然談到遺產問題。母親說，“先生，您瞧我的女兒多少沒有理山。她告訴她的爸爸，立遺囑時把全部產業多給牠。至於我的晚年生活費用由她來俱給。自然，這是不可能的”。女兒說，“爸爸，不是麼？遺產交給我以後，我不是也會照顧媽媽？不是麼，爸爸？”她說完後很親熱地給父親一個吻。於是乎當客人面前母女間起了衝突。父親呢，他只微笑着不說話。</p>
<p>這種情形我們所能够了解的，就是母親替她的兩位兒子着想，倘若母親得到全部遺產，那末她的兩個兒子起碼也可以分得一些。恰因為這一點這位姑娘就不願意。她自然不讓她兩位同母異父的兄弟也共同享受這份遺產。然而我們所無法了解的，就是當着父親面前大家這麼公開來討論他他後的問題。我們并不是說什麼諱忌，但這種談話使一位健康的父親聽了，將發生那一種感想！尤其使我們覺得奇怪的，在座的客人太家都來參加討論，好像這是宗極平常的事件。大家都把父親忘記了</p>
<p>歐洲人究竟是欧洲人。像這種話，我們中國入是决不敢说的。</p>
<p>二十四　德國的外交家</p>
<p>一位德國人说：“我们有軍人式的軍人，問時也有軍人式的外交家，一部德國的悲就在這里”。許多人都認為上次德國在歐戰時的失敗第一個要負責的人物是德國的外交官。有的人更說，在德國歷史上除了俾斯麥以外，根本就找不出一位第一流的外交家。雖然德國曾產生過許多名將。</p>
<p>“第三帝國”目前也患着同樣的毛病，缺乏良好的外交人材。平心而論，一般歐洲人對於蘇俄的恐怖只有比對於德國厲害。但德國沒有李維諾夫這類人物，於是乎大家反而覺得德國特別可怕的了。年來德國正在設法，想在外交上打出一條新路，不過是否行得通自然是一個問題。</p>
<p>一個例。去年秋天但澤自由市議院議長格萊瑟博士代表但澤出席國聯。當他演說完後，將右手高舉向各國代表行了一個希特勒敬禮。這一來不但旁聽的各國新聞記者哄笑起來，甚至於在塲的各國外交團有的也忍不住笑聲格萊瑟博士生氣了。當他退席時走過新聞記者旁聽席，特地向大家作了一個鬼臉。各國記者自然不肯放鬆，於是大家發生爭執。結果英國外相艾登說，格萊瑟傳士的鬼臉他并沒有看見，一塲風波，始暫告平息。第二天各國報紙說，格萊瑟博士的錯處，在於把日內瓦國聯會議願看做阿拉伯街頭，所以有這一塲笑話。</p>
<p>另外一個例。德國駐英大使李班特洛甫先生（德日“防共協約”的簽字人）新近於呈遞國書與英王喬治第六時，不按照英國慣例行鞠躬禮，却也來一個希特勒敬禮。這在素來富於保守性的英國人看來簡直是有意侮辱。英國報紙對於此事的反感，自然在情理之中。按希特勒敬禮除右手高舉以外，口裏尚須喊：希特勒萬歲，為什麼要向英王喊希特勒萬歲，這一點我們無論如何都猜測不出。李班特洛夫先生是目前主持德國外交的要人。也許他希望由此得到英國人的敬畏。假如他眞的有這麼念頭時，那末他把英國人看錯了。</p>
<p>一家法國報說，俄意兩國也是新式政體，可是他們的大使對於英王却照例鞠躬，為什麼德國人特別高興例外。記得有一種笑話，有人把外交家與女人分為兩型人物。當一個姑娘口裏說“不”時，意思是“也許”；說“也許”時，已經是同意的了。一位聰明的女性絕對不肯把“是”字說出口來的。相反的是外交家。外交家口中的“是”只等於“也許”。當他說“也許”時，已經是“不”的不。例如一位張三請李四帮忙一宗事情。李四是吊人可以直截了當地拒絕他說，“不能。”但李四是一位外交家就應當說，“也許，”或者“讓我試試看。”</p>
<p>德國人的爽直性格有時是可愛的。但應用到外交塲上去那未就要使別人“莫明其妙”的了。</p>
<p>二十五　一位法女記者論德國男人</p>
<p>德法兩國雖說只有萊茵河一水之隔，但東西兩岸究竟是兩個世界。不單人種，言語，風俗不同，就是說每日生活也有極大的差別。例如好裝飾是法國婦女的習慣，甚至於有的男子也要夾途脂擦粉這一套，德國呢，恰是相反。除了大城市的婦女以外，大部分德國婦女都是粗枝大葉，身邊不帶粉盒的姑娘。正因為這種區別，所以我們從一位法國女性口中，聽到她對於德國男人的論調，自然是一宗很有趣味的事情。</p>
<p>大約半年前某次無意中認識了一位法女記者。當她聽到記者也明瞭一些德國現狀，於是乎我們的談話就以德國問題為中心。她說，多年來她幾乎一年一度地在德國各地作一次旅行。目的在於聽音樂。但自從希特勒登台以後，她這種成了慣例的旅行只好取消掉。原因，德國已經沒有眞正的音樂家。在她看來，希特勒在藝術上所犯的罪過比其他的一切都深重！</p>
<p>她說“………德國的男子麼？呵！一種多麼不懂得情趣的人物！幾乎每一個德國男人都是兵士，最少都含有兵士的氣概。軍人的特色在於會發命令，會服從命令。德國男子白天在軍營中會服從命令，晚上回到家裏來就會向妻子發命令。這幾乎已經成為習慣，德國的男子是德國女人的長官。……”</p>
<p>“德國男子也有許多好處，”她接着說：“例如善組織，生活紀律化，有毅力，研究學問時有精密的態度，特別是對於政治問題有全盤的理論，有時這理論錯誤得很厲害，但他却有自信力，相信那是對的………然而这一切對於我們女人又有什麼用處？他們不懂得女人，或者他們不願意去懂她。他們同你談天，不是告訴你軍操怎麼樣好，就是對你說，某人的理論在某點上有某種弱點。或者說明某種新式機械的妙用在那裏。我們女人要聽這種乾燥無味的論調，甚至於戰爭。你瞧，先生，這就是德國的男人！”</p>
<p>“………我們女子所需要聽的，是一種溫情，不是一種嚴重的人生問題。我們所需要的，是一種稍為懂得我們內心的人物，而不是戰士。我時常懷疑，到底大部分德國男人懂不懂得人生的意義？………”這是她的結論</p>
<p>這位女記者的說法，當然不無中肯的地方。不過，我們覺得，讓法國女子去批評德國男人，恰像蘇州姑娘眼中的山東大漢。出發點根本就不同。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>誠與信</h3>
<p>— 起</p>
<p>最近有人對國事抱着很大的樂觀。因爲他們看到國內有了一種團結的新精神。　　又有人抱着悲觀。因爲他們覺得這團結的精神也許和曇花一現似地容易消逝。</p>
<p>這團結精神的能不能持續。國事究竟是否可以樂觀。我以爲决定於全國上下的兩種態度之有無。那兩種態度呢。一是誠。二是信。</p>
<p>要衷心地接受這二種態度。我們先得不容情地指摘出吾們不誠不信的兩種毛病來。現在是什麼時候了。還容我們諱疾忌醫麼。</p>
<p>不必諱言的。直到眼前。全國上下雖有了團結一致的覺醒。所行所爲。却未必與此覺醒盡相應合。待人還不免乎不誠。對人還不免乎不信。這兩種態度不除。所謂團結。所謂統一。便似紙糊燈籠。經不起微風細雨。就要現出破碎的原形的。</p>
<p>所謂誠者。就是無所蔽曲的意思。示人以無他的意思。旣然無所蔽曲。則無論功罪是非。都如日中天。人人皆得而見之。旣然人人皆得而見之。最低度不會引起人家的猜疑誤會。我們歷觀過去辦理外交的人所遭遇到的許多意外糾紛。太半都是由於態度的不誠所致。至於說示人以無他。那是涉及做事的動機。比上一層更來得重要。我們處事。如果面上標榜這樣。心里懷着另樣的計較。或是故意聲東擊西。表直裏曲。那更爲僨事之尤。能坦白自然無所蔽曲。眞摯別人自不致疑有其他。所謂誠者就是坦白與眞摯的總義。</p>
<p>所謂信者。就是推心置腹的意思。在今天。中國人都面着同樣的命運。負着同樣的任務。走着同樣的路子。旣然要携手同行。如何還能不推心置腹。就以抗敵禦侮来說吧。中國人在這總目標下。便應泯絕一切猜嫌。拋棄一切舊賬。心心相印地共同工作着。如果還有人懷着鬼胎。以爲有那些人宿命地不能参列抗敵禦侮的營堡中來。那簡直是執行自殺政策。有一個思想家說過這麼一句聰明話。信仰能產生所信仰的事實。反過來說。就是沒有信仰。則所信仰的事。自然絕對不會產生。這話在我們普通人事關係中。也可找出不少的例證。譬如有一張君。對於李君是很好的。可是李君對張君沒有信念。懷着鬼胎。以爲張君沒有好心思。因此對張君的態度也變了。這樣下去。就是很好的友誼也會破裂的。沒有信仰的人往往演著悲劇。他可不知道自己是悲劇的製作者。</p>
<p>誠與信是一個環。缺一是不成的。待人不誠。怎能呌人起信。不能信人。別人又何從誠起。所以。在“國亡無日”的現時。我們中國人。不論上下。無分朝野。莫問階層。更應該推誠相與。以信相見。這樣。所謂團結統一。才不會變成外鑠的强合。</p>
<p>也許有人以爲上面這些老生常談。有“代人立言”之嫌。则請他注意現在中國人全體是不是已經有了一個共同的要求。共同的行動鋼領。丟開是非不論。在理論和行動的綱領沒有一致以前。誠與信也許還可說非策略所能容。現在明明大家異口同聲地提出救亡圖存的要求。還能以這樣話來掩飾推諉麼。</p>
<p>近來很有人注意國民的心理改造與建設。我們以爲誠與信二端乃是全國上下心理建設的根本。</p>

<h3>增重民衆負擔</h3>
<p>社大之水谷長三郎首先中張反對、對於藏相大施攻擊謂—</p>
<p>此次之增稅案、無論間接稅與直接稅、仍歸勤勞大衆負担者也、至於龐大之軍費、除促民衆窮困外、別無所謂、擴大國防費容應以何時爲止境、吾人對於促民窮困之增　稅絕對反對、若圖充實國防、則不應增加民衆之負担、應對於資本家　或地主實行增稅也、結城藏相之所謂與軍部握手、不外乎軍部與金融資本家之　握手而已、此項增稅仍應一由被壓迫階級起而　行使歷史的否認者也、</p>
<h3>結城考慮欠週</h3>
<p>水谷氏演畢、鼓掌之聲大起、其次由民政黨之高橋守平起稱、—</p>
<p>結城財政方針雖善、而對於政治的結果、殊覺考慮不足、故吾人由此見地、提山六項附帶决議、務望注意糾正、</p>
<p>伊禮肇（國同）起稱—</p>
<p>臨時增稅法　案第六條第一項之修正、吾人表示反對、其他部分則表贊成、並朗讀國民同盟之希　望絛項、復謂此項增稅計畫、係以資本家階級爲本位、未聽國民大衆與中小商工業者之呼籲聲云云、</p>
<p>宮澤胤勇（民政）起稱臨時利得稅　原爲糾正都市農村之跛行景氣者、故於根本糾正之際　應卽廢除、</p>
<h3>小會派之搗亂</h3>
<p>宮澤氏繼論地方交附金與物價問題　及國防費之增大等節、長述不休、議塲頗呈厭態、於是“間單”之聲瀕起、宮澤氏至此述以莫名其妙之贊成論調、當時松永氏　動議主張截止討論、因政民兩黨多數起立而決定、但小會派忽發生大搗亂、前田耕作（第二）跳入民政黨議員席上、大聲疾呼、當被議塲衛士押歸原席、此時小會派表示贊成者　達三十人以上、對於可否截止討論、要求記名投票、開票之結果、以絕對多數贊成松永主張截止討論、於是該項動議得以成立、</p>
<h3>最後表决通過</h3>

<h3>奧斯德敗於西洋南華南希望突高</h3>
<p>李惠堂連中三元敗華塞斯　包家平攔江截斗功亦不小</p>
<p>（港訊）十四日星期日尋常杯甲組足球、南華南賴李惠堂之三射、冷勝勁旅華塞斯三球、渡此難關、而前日西洋却以四對二擊敗奧斯德、予南華南助力不少、用是南華南成績得與奧斯德相等、僅少賽一塲）從此前途如錦、所餘各塲、已無荊棘、行看蟬聯三屆冠軍之美夢，將必可完成也、茲先將四强形勢列下、</p>
<p>是日戰觀者殊多、掃桿埔中、四座客滿、雙方均以勁敵當前　無不努力以赴、南華譚江柏缺席、而久已不見之葉北華、忽重現身手當左翼、鄭季良退補左衛　用隊實力相衡、南華實高一着　接觸之後、卽见懸殊、李惠堂之射門絕技、大寒敵胆、果於十二分鐘之內、首建功動、華塞斯旋得十二碼球、竟被家平擋救、上半時一比零、下半時華塞斯不振、復因左中衛泰羅受傷出塲、僅以十人應戰　常處下風、惠常再進兩球、乃以三比零勝、南華老包、持家謹愼、鄭季良反串左衛、與李天生搭擋、居然演來規矩、拱衛得宜、中衛三子呵成一氣、前鋒曹黎葉平平無奇、李馮最出色、李使出混身解數、挑盤撥射、令人叫絕、華塞斯陣勢紊亂、聯絡散渙、攻則有勇無謀、守則臨危不定、其致敗也宜矣、</p>
<p>李惠堂　國脚破敵</p>
<p>裁判員李路氏山塲鳴笛啟戰、南華首取攻勢、李惠堂神出鬼沒、猛放急箭、羅蘭士拱手歡迎、轉瞬南華再來光顧、溫連犯規、惠堂主踢、直射龍門、羅蘭士又接去、華塞斯兩度進兵、徒勞無功、南華黎馮兩輔、次第迫敵門、亦未成事、華塞斯化守為攻、鄭季良在禁地外勇拒巴利、被判罰球、伊雲士望門直吊、家平妙手接球、旋沙利雲重來、撥球交羅拔士深入射門、中柱出界、大戰十二分鐘、南華已入佳境、黃美順中路送球、李馮短傳而進、惠堂輾轉深入、急足掃射、打開紀錄、掌聲滿塲、</p>
<p>包家平　鐵手保城</p>
<p>華塞斯旣失守、急圖報復、中綫再開之後、三數回合之間、拖拔盤球而進、斜撇左方、羅拔士趨前接應、底綫回球禁地、竟中美順之手、得一十二碼球、沙利雲踢出不勁、家平鐵手𢫦接、沙欲趕上一脚、已告　及、南華逃過大難、前鋒又告活動、黎曹合作、迫得角球、泰羅發出、季良遠奉回原璧、惠堂接球盤上遠射、球去如矢、可惜偏出界外、華塞斯反攻、沙利雲近門、泰羅遠吊、均被家平沒收、拖拔繼之殺上、轉沙利雲近門斜射、家平撲救出險、敵軍死不甘心、伊雲士截球交巴利傳中、羅蘭士左方嚮應、搖頭猛頂、越楣而出、半時亦告終結、</p>
<p>﻿　　華塞斯　損兵折將</p>
<p>易地再賽、形勢已不如前緊張、溫連供球拖拔、遠放冷箭、偏斜下野、俄而泰羅因高歷黎兆榮、墮地傷手、離塲而去、從此僅以十人應戰、南華常佔土風、黎榮照之吊高球、羅蘭士接得送出、美順截刦送前、景祥斜揮、北華疾進、伊雲士被迫失角球、拚命殺出、北華旋因勇戰傷足、退塲小休、雙方以十人戰十人、曹桂成深入敵陣、傑庭殺成角球、桂成踢出後、巴利反窺、傳中險球、幸爲榮照殺出重圍、惠常縱橫敵陣、桂成迫得角球、伊雲士在後衛界外、不戒於手、惠堂主踢罰球、直取龍門、又被羅蘭士接收、</p>
<p>南華南　衣錦旋鄕</p>
<p>此時北華復出、華塞斯已漸覺不支、至二十一分鐘時、梁榮照從後推進、交球送前、三鋒五傳、破防而入、傑庭手觸皮球、萬目共見、但竟未受極刑、惠堂雄心頓起、從人叢中左挑右撥、猛發利砲、清清楚楚、球入龍門、造成二比零之局、華寒斯一度掙扎、迫得角球、無濟於事、桂成久伏思動、妙脚傳中、羅蘭士一拍一踢、暫解燃眉之急、至二十八分鐘時、李天生殺遇敵人、大脚送前、曹桂成閃過傑庭、沿邊斜送惠堂、突飛猛進、威拉啣星窮追不及、被李近門掃射、又建奇功、乃成三比零之凈數、　華塞斯士無鬬志、難破光蛋、不久遂告完塲、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、各月微見上漲、但美棉三品紗花俱見回挫、然本埠人心轉趨堅昂、因空方乘外棉回小時、紛起扒補、於是市盤由疲反挺、三盤各月猛跳一元七八角至二元、遠期一律漲破四十元關口矣、迨至收盤、聞現紗交易較前爲少、成交一千三百包、售價漲一二元、收盤略小、標紗結果各月比上日收盤均漲一元七·九角至二元一角、午後開盤、市情更挺、以現紗消息良好、空頭紛起扒補、市盤愈拍愈緊、遠月漲力益强、迨至收盤、再進一歩、聞現紗生意有四千包以外、標紗結果各月比上午收盤價再漲一元三·四·五角、查賣出吉豐一千包、明德一千七百五十包、賡豐八千零五十包、長餘一千零五十包、愼記一千三百五十包、仁豐一千包、義成二千包、長豐四千四百包、恊成二千九百五十包、恒昌一千四百包、昶記一千一百包、瑞大一千一百包、望泰興一千零五十包、泰昌三千九百五十包、大昶一千二百五十包、同和一千四百包、買進大孚三千四百五十包、恒益二千五百五十包、錦昌二千五百五十包、振大一千七百五十包、合興四千六百包、同豐一千七百包、豐泰二千八百包、大昌成三千九百包、大昶四千四百五十包、裕大五千一百包、潤康一千五百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>漢花可解棉花不若紗市之昂</p>
<p>棉市續漲、且氣勢堅挺、蓋以美棉連朝狂騰、上海市塲尚未漲足、昨則美棉稍見回風、一般浮空乘機扒補、於是檯面乾枯、市盤反趨上漲、但據一部份云、本月份因沙市花與漢口花、均能交解、故午後收盤市情稍挫、</p>
<p>標花補空與了多均有</p>

<p>遠期新麥因春賽獨俏</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因洋麥接連高漲、氣候又轉不正、故開價後各月份均較前日好三四五分不等、惟交易不暢、勢成擯局、迨至下午開盤、三四月份初尚平定、旋以本月份之津帮多頭、吐賣甚暢、致人心突轉不佳、傾瀉頗暴、至收盤竟小至六元二角一分、四月份亦因此故、較初開跌去六分、六月份以下、因天時及洋麥關係、人心反好、較上午回振三四分、現麥市面、見交甚少惟以天雨關係價則微好、開江北麥六元三角七分、崇明麥六元一角八分、祗開四五百包云、</p>

<p>由主席姜豪報告、略謂、“各位代表、各位同志、今天是“三一八”北平民衆革命的紀念日、關於這件事實的經過、現在先報告一下、就是在十五年春、直魯聯軍與國民軍相持於平津一帶、國民軍爲了防止直魯軍的渤海艦隊之襲擊、所以把大沽海口封鎖起來、禁止中外一切船舶的通行、中國軍隊封銷自己海口、這本是獨立國家在領海應有的權利、但是帝國主義是不管你權利不樓利的、日本軍艦首先故意駛入、而且於三月十二日、竟然砲轟大沽口、不僅此也、三月十六日、荷蘭公使代表辛丑條約諸國、藉口辛丑條約、提出最後通牒、並且調集各該國軍艦、實行威脅、至此、北平民衆因爲看到北京軍閥政府的歷次媚外辱國行爲、預料對於這件事情、必然會出於屈服和承認其要求的，遂於三月十八日、在天安門外、舉行國民大會、集議應付辦法、並向執政府請願、那知執政府非但不接受民衆善意的進言、反而命令衛隊開槍掃射民衆、由是當塲殉難者五十餘人、重傷者七十餘人、輕傷者更不勝計、這就是那次北方革命的民衆爲維護國權而向軍閥政府和帝國主義者鬬爭所遭受的壯烈犧牲的概况、從這次事件的昭示、我們可以清清楚楚的知道、軍閥是完全以個人私利的企圖下、他們只要求得茍安一時、只要求得保全地盤、他們是不惜把國脈民命、長跪於敵人之前、而雙手獻奉的、對於民衆一方面、反而當作唯一的敵人、竟大施淫威、不惜刀槍並使、至於帝國主義對於弱小民族、本來只有盡情侵略爲前提、對於那般賣國求榮的軍閥和漢奸、更是一隨喜怒而玩之於掌握之中、惟有對於革命的民衆、一方面是害怕、一方面視之爲唯一敵人、而用了種種直接和間接的方法、來加以殺戮、我們知道了軍閥和帝國主義的這種眞面目、我們知道了北平民衆在軍閥和帝國主義雙重的壓迫下、遭受了這次壯烈的犧牲、我們今天來紀念他們、我們紀念的意義、究竟是怎樣的呢、北平的許多革命民衆、在十一年以前、於軍閥和帝國主義萬惡勢力的摧殘下犧牲、現在我們來看一看、我們的現實環境、軍閥的惡勢力、固然於北伐成功後、一一的打倒、但是目前許多出賣祖國出賣靈魂的漢奸的前身、不多數是軍閥嗎、至於帝國主義、我們看一看十五年以後、到最近幾年來的情形、五三慘案•九一八•二八•和冀察綏三省的匪亂、這些不都是我們的芳鄰所惠賜的佳禮嗎、我們處於目前環境之中、軍閥餘孽的漢奸、和帝國主義所給我們的慘痛、十百倍於民國十五年以前、我們今天紀念“三一八”烈士的唯一意義、就是要效法諸先烈爲國犧牲的精神、一致團結起來、向挽救國難的血路上奮進、一方面大家要厲行新生活運動、使禮義廉恥的精神、實現於衣食住行的實際生活上、然後可以造成道德高尚、智識豐富和體格強健的國民、個個人能做具有最高戰鬭力的現代國民、一方面要厲行國民經濟建設運動、節省各人的浪費、集中全國的財力、來豐裕國民的生活、和建設國防基礎的國家經濟力、充實國民個人的智德體三育、和建設國家命脈的經濟力、這是目前救亡圖存的二大基本工作、我們要救國和救自己、只有把這二件工作當作我們終身努力的目標、同時在目前我們一方面要肅清赤匪和漢奸、以除我民族內在之隱忠、而收安內攘外之實效、同志們、我們今天紀念北平“三一八”犧牲的先烈、我們要完成我們應該繼續努力的使命、我們大家唯有擁護中央整個的國策、在偉大領袖蔣委員長領導之下、來共同努力、”</p>

<p>我方提案</p>

<p>臨行談話</p>
<p>朱氏於輪次向各報社記者發表書面談話云、本人此次奉派代表出席世界紡織會議及第二十三屆國際勞工大會、自顧菲才、深懼勿勝、且以事務覊身、事實上亦不能擺脫、但中央以本人前次會出席大會、人地較𤍠、可不再遣派秘書顧問隨行、以節經費固辭不獲、祇有勉承其乏、此行先至華盛頓、參加世界紡織會議、吾國參加此會、尚屬初次、並無提案、會後卽轉道日內瓦出席六月三日舉行之廿三屆國勞大會、本屆大會之議程、爲討論健築工人安全及紡織印刷化學工業縮減工時、修正工業工人及非工業工人最低年齡公約等問題、縮减工時、係屬本屆大會兩級討論程序之第二階段、大會根據各國政府答復、卽可制定國際公約、在歐美工業進步、生產過剩國家、縮減工作時間、確可調整勞力需供、救濟失業、吾國工業、尚在萌芽時代、正須埋頭加緊生產、故目前尚無此幫要、本人此次擬向火會提出關於日人在華走私及工廠檢查二提案、前者不僅直接影響工人生計、且足以動搖中國整個金融、應使國際間對於此種卑污行爲、有充分正確之認識、以促成輿論的制裁、至於租界工廠檢查問題、過去國際勞工局從中斡旋頗力、年來雖經多方交涉、仍未完全解决、此事關係工人生計康健幸福、及吾國主權至鉅、且中國目前大部份工業、均在租界區內及外資經營之下、故此問題之解决、需要至爲迫切、中國目前正在走向工業社會之途、勞工問題、已漸爲各方所注意、此誠為可喜的現象、但工人之疾苦及地位、每易爲一般人所忽視、吾人認爲建設一個新國家、决非少數人所能肩此大任、換言之、在生產建設過程中、資本與勞力實有同等的重要性、必使勞工生活安裕經濟建設、始能順利推進也、此行頂計約四個日後返國、今日承各方友好遠送、曷勝感激、尚祈隨時賜敎、以匡不逮、</p>

<h3>服飾華貴的女伶歆動法院觀衆</h3>
<p>王彩雲因汽車控案到庭　一般訴訟人羣向之注目</p>
<p>近幾年來、社會上各行各業都在鬧不景氣、而失業的人們、更是與日俱增、“另找出路”•“尋覓麺包”、幾成爲大衆普遍的呼聲、惟獨娛樂事業、居然得天獨厚、尚在蓬蓬勃勃向上發展、而俳優人材、遂因有閒階級之提倡、日有造就、現在單就目前百戲盛行中之</p>
<p>蘇灘一部門</p>
<p>而言、其種類較諸往昔增加、奚啻倍蓰、男女演員、更僕難數、此中成名而紅極一時者、更比比皆是、如在新新公司等游戲塲演唱之女演員王彩雲、尚是個中中駟材、而其服御之奢華、已可與貴族婦女並駕齊驅、若等而上之者、則其</p>
<p>奢侈之舉動</p>
<p>當亦不難想象、昨日午後彩雲以無錢償付所欠汽車修理費等欵、爲利喴汽車公司控諸第一特區地方法院、特偕其弟投案候審、服飾異常麗都、御萊青色綢長袍、足登褐色革履、左手中指戴鑽戒、右手中指與無名指則各戴紅寶石翡翠戒一、左腕</p>
<p>復束一金條</p>
<p>脫未開庭前小立於第十三法庭門首、其地本爲一長形之通道、兩旁各室、槪係法庭、終日不被陽光、雖頂有電炬二三、然燈光如豆、人至其處、莫不感覺黑暗、茲被彩雲兩手之鑽光寶氣、耀入眼簾、致一時廣集此長弄中之一般訴訟人的視綫、不期然集於此豸、彩雲身段婀娜頎長、</p>
<p>雙頰染胭脂</p>
<p>經衆注目之下、頰上桃花、愈形紅艶、其最被人指摘之點、厥爲右肋衣襟扣紐處懸鑰匙一串、數約七八枚之多、斯殆其家中全部箱篋開啓之具歟、今旣須臾不離其身、且復不置諸囊中、血形於外、故見者多謂個妮子意在自炫、俄而推事方還、率同書記官開庭、彩雲遂被丁役傳呼人庭受審、惟</p>
<p>利喴車公司</p>
<p>竟無代表到案、當據彩雲供稱、伊之汽車雖購自該公司、但修理則係另一公司承乏、故並不欠原告之欵方推事旋以原告未經到庭、不能進行審究、宣告將案延判、王彩雲遂仍緊握法院送交伊之本案訴狀副本一份、傳票一紙姍姍步出法庭、與乃弟歸去、在此翩若驚鴻之影中、其過處猶聞“可惜伊人兩只眼睛稍有大小”之笑聲焉、</p>
<h3>養女中止收養法院庭訊紀實</h3>
<p>養女祇請求五十金　主婦兇悍堅决不允　法官勸導始给二十</p>
<p>時和首飾公司職员粤人梁杏卿、家住虹口武昌路文鏡里九號、其妻陳佩瓊、亦嶺南產、年三旬餘、平日居家御下甚厲、往歲曾領養一女名秀珍、現該女年已十九、事梁陳如父母、而陳氏則視之如婢僕、女不能受、至上月悄然而逸、經陳氏報由虹口捕房將女查獲、解經法院審訊之下、着陳氏領回、但女深懼歸後必遭更</p>
<p>殘苛之凌虐</p>
<p>故迄未返現陳氏乃延律師具呈第一特區地方決院、請求對秀珍終止牧養關係、昨日下午、由徐福基推事開庭傳審、李秀珍亦偕律師出庭、該女所穿藍衣長衫、絨小短外套、及足上皮鞋、均已破舊不堪、短髮蓬蓬、面容戚戚、異常缺乏活潑女郎之形態、據女訴稱、</p>
<p>原籍係蘇州</p>
<p>被收養時才五歲•因不堪凌虐、始於上月十九日出走、並未竊取任何物件、現寓義姊家、請首陳氏給我五十金、暫充目前生活費、次不願再回陳氏家等語、徐推事用喚陳氏至案、諭以秀珍所要求者、祇區區五十金、事尚易爲、汝不若卽遂其願、毋須涉訟、且訟亦需錢、該婦聞論、</p>
<p>竟不肯一破</p>
<p>慳囊、連稱無錢無錢不置、徐推事乃勸其減給三十元、婦仍頻頻搖首、官因問其“請律師何以有錢、”婦則稱“律師係帮忙”官曰“律師旣非汝之親戚、焉有帮忙可能、况此種案件、更無樹上開花之希望、足見汝之爲人、實屬太兇、”此際陳婦之律師遂遵庭上意旨、向婦反覆開導、婦始</p>
<p>礙於勸告者</p>
<p>情面、聲言願給付十元、並不允再有所增益、徐推事見該婦未易理喻、不免躊躇、而婦之律師卽聲明彼願助以五金、官覺猶有轉環餘地、爰再不憚唇舌、對婦君最後勸告、着其凑足二十元、俾女得充短時間之生活費、婦猶移推諉、嗣始從之、當經書記官製就彼此脫離關係之和解筆錄、由婦與女及雙方律師相繼簽字結案、</p>
<h3>被本夫控通姦婦人訴說身世</h3>
<p>爲生計所逼迫始與人姘居　夫亦深知其事並時來取款</p>
<p>住居南市文明路一六五號之本地人顧文寶、向在專售機器油之元昌華行辦事、於十年前娶北平女子武文娟爲室、育有一子、年已十二、近顧忽向新閘捕房報告、謂其妻武文娟與粵人謝鴻標通奸、同居於青島路八十號等情、捕房乃飭探目阮瑤前往調查屬實、由工部局律師蔣保廉依刑法二三九條</p>
<p>妨害家庭</p>
<p>罪起訴、業經特一院一度傳訊、因有和解希望、諭令改期再訊、各情已誌本報、昨晨、此案由詹良策推事升座刑二庭更新審理、捕房律師蔣保廉陳述起訴意旨後、卽據顧文寶投稱、與武文娟結婚、已有十餘年、育有一子、年已十二歲、數年前、我妻忽然出走、經我四出探訪、查無踪跡、直至上月間、始</p>
<p>在途撞見</p>
<p>乃暗隨於後、見我妻步人青島路八十號、遂據悄報告捕房云云、武文娟供、年卅二歲、北平人、與謝鴻標同居、已有五年、曾育一孩、亦已四歲、查我與謝之結合、丈夫完全知悉、蓋我自嫁顧文寶後、因顧不務正業、不加瞻養、乃入華成烟公司爲女職员、及後生意被歇、爲生計所迫、祇得</p>
<p>不顧廉恥</p>
<p>轉人民和里王老二所開之弄玉書庽爲侍葉、其時我丈夫固所深知、且曾向夫詢問　來倘有客人如何辦法、夫答祇須給我錢財、可以自便、從此丈夫不時前來取欵、每次三五元不等、我尚顧全丈夫之顏面、如撞見客人、緅推稱丈夫爲親戚、最後實因不堪其苦、乃毅然於民國二十年向上海地方法院提起</p>
<p>離婚之訴</p>
<p>因條件不合、致我遭取訴、當我在書庽時、卽遇客人謝鴻標、詢悉我之身世可憐、在爲不忍遂和屋同居、維持我之生活、迄已五載、丈夫亦所深知、在此數年之中、夫輙候我於小菜場借欵、或竞至青島路八十號、因我與謝同居樓上、夫</p>
<p>不敢登樓</p>
<p>遂向房客婦人陳張氏探詢謝是否出外、如已外出、則請樓上之女人下來、迨我下樓、必給欵數元、今日陳張氏亦已到案云云、繼據謝鴻標供認與武文娟同居、惟不知其係有夫之婦、又據見證婦人陳張氏證明顧文寶確曾前來、託我邀武文娟</p>
<p>下樓談話</p>
<p>惟借欵之事、則不知、末由顧文寶供明武文娟頃間所供、全非事實、因自武出走後、從未謀面，亦無時向借欺之事、此次在改期中扯告豁曾向我切解默掛狀一千覺、經我拒絕、應請嚴意、詹推事饑會案尚有展期調會護據吃必要、儿齡改劇下足期二再訊、</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>最後，我們從近代政治的眞相來研究的結果，便充分的說明了近代政治有四個大的趨勢：</p>
<p>甲•由多黨趨於一黨；</p>
<p>乙•由分權趨於集權；</p>
<p>丙•由合議趨於獨裁；</p>
<p>丁•由重法治而趨於重人治•</p>
<p>這四個大的傾向，是今天政治裏所值得研究的問題•我們要研究今天的中國政治，當然要研究今天的世界政治；因爲在這二十世紀裏，無論政治，軍事，經濟，統統要受世界影響•所以，我們一定要在研究今天世界政治以後，才能研究今天的中國政治•說到此處，不禁使我想起墨素里尼氏批評近代民主政治創始國家——美國——的政治的一段話，墨氏股：“今天的美國是一個無政治的國家，因爲美國人民是一些無政治觀念的人民•因爲他們要四年才有一回討論吃啤酒與不吃啤酒的問題•這種人民還有政治的觀念，政治的思想，和政治的行動嗎”？墨氏的話是否正確，我們自不能肯定；但是我們想一想：一個國家的人民，要到四年才討論吃不吃啤酒的問題，其政治觀念之薄弱，的確是可想而知•但是我們回轉頭來看一看中國，中國的情形恐更比美國不如，因爲他們還能夠四年討論一次自己的切身問題，而我們大部份的人民連討論也不知道討論，——根本不知道什麼是政治，討論什麼呢？我以爲：過去的中國政治——也許一直到今天——只有兩件事：㊀要人民的錢；㊁打人民的屁股•除此以外，還有什麼關係呢？眞是言之痛心！（未完）</p>

<h3>大掌櫃</h3>
<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>身體很肥胖，大約要兩個平常人，拚在一塊，還要外加幾十斤肉，才能配成他吧。臉子紫糖色，極其飽滿結實。說話聲音，頂響亮。打個哈哈，會震驚你的耳朶。他姓周，但大家都不提，只呌他大掌櫃，這一則因為他塊頭大，二則也因爲他是個開大雜貨店的。</p>
<p>出門呌黃包車的時候，車夫看一下他，又看一下車子，會担心地說道：</p>
<p>「怕坐不下吧？」</p>
<p>他一面上去，一面説道：</p>
<p>「不要緊，我會側起身子坐的。」</p>
<p>車夫無可如何，便要多加車錢，他就胡亂哼了一聲，充作答允。等到跑到目的地，他却一個錢也不添，反而把雙手往背後一抄，挺起肚，抑着頭，邊走邊說：</p>
<p>「你說你累嗎？哼，我也坐得不愜意呀！真是受罪，真是受罪！」</p>
<p>出街回來，一進門就照例要嚷道：</p>
<p>「拿點啥來打尖呀！」</p>
<p>一個乾癟了的老女僕，便不聲不響，端出一碗紅燒牛肉給他。他接看大嚼，一壁還自駡自己。</p>
<p>「媽的，真是越窮越餓！」</p>
<p>其實他哪裏窮呢，大雜貨店之外，還有好些當舖。而且，商會會長每次替當局籌欵，也總不會忘記他。他打了尖之後，便要喊道：</p>
<p>「今天的報呢？」</p>
<p>如果不找來給他，他也不會發氣的。因為早上一下床，就已讀過報，把重要的新聞，如米糧長跌之類，瀏覽過了，這時只不過拿來消遣而已。本省新聞，本國新聞以至莫明其妙的外國新聞也看，但看了之後的批評，總是一句話：</p>
<p>「胡鬧！」</p>
<p>再不然，便是尚未看完，就朝報紙上，點着鼻了打盹了。</p>
<p>他在大雜貨店內，頂喜歡坐的地方，便是管賬先生和木櫃式的錢斗之間。夥計些懂得他的脾氣，就將那隻為他特別做的蠻大交椅，擺在那裏。他並不是要監督賬，或者親自管理銀錢，而是他高興聽那些夥計，把錢丟錢斗時，那種嘩啦嘩啦的驟響，以及他們向管賬先生講「五元找三角」之類的聲音。據他說，這總比到什麽戲院，去聽男子唱女人的腔調，有味道些。</p>
<p>至於什麽當塲籌欵一類的讌會，他是更不願意去了。如果過後向他責難的話，他就會拍一拍臀部，笑着分辯道：</p>
<p>「我來做什麽？……你們没椅子給我坐呀！」</p>
<p>他對人生，認為一切都假，只有銀子錢賺在手裏，才算是頂真實的。但到三十五歲時，突然想個把兒女了，便討個小，不生。三十七歲，又討個，也不生。毛病在哪裏呢？想不出。一滿四十歲，着急了，於是乎只好信神。每年六月間，城隍菩薩出駕的時候，說由他自告奮勇，一壁揩拭滿頭的汗，一面扶着城隍的駕遊街。因為這在傳說上講，的確可以生兒子，而且又只是出氣力，並不大花錢的好事情。</p>
<p>此後，也做慈善事業，省城的紅十字會，他便出過幾塊錢，買過一塊正會員的徽章，拿來和牙籤之類，一齊吊在衣　上面。但會裏的辦事人，來替傷兵募捐醫藥費時，他却生氣地駡道：</p>
<p>「誰叫他們打仗呀！真是些儍瓜！」</p>
<p>接着，便又和顏悅色起來，講一大籮筐，不關緊要的話，把這募捐的事情鳻開。如果募捐的人還不知趣告辭，他就親手將茶葉呀，火腿呀，等等東西，捧出來，對募捐的慇慇勤勤地指點道：</p>
<p>「這是頂好的貨色，聞一聞看，砰香呀！別家不會拿這種給你的。………買一點吧，價錢公道哪，難道我們熟人，還會賺你錢麽？」</p>
<p>各廟的當家和尚，知道他想兒女，便乘機貢獻方法，他先前是討厭這批人的，現在也很虛心的接納了。因爲他懂得這猶如做生意，須要多方的盤算，單是扶城隍的嗎，是不够的但是和尚無論講什麽好辦法，歸根結蒂，總是要給菩薩出點錢才行，譬如替大佛穿金以及買油點天燈之類。大掌櫃怎麽辦呢，皺緊眉頭，想了一想，就慷慨地説道：</p>
<p>「你拿緣簿來吧！」</p>
<p>和尚請他自家寫，他便露出又粗又壯的手腕，推辭道：</p>
<p>「看哪，這怎麽成？寫起來顫顫抖科的，呌我畫蛇麽？」</p>
<p>和尚問他願出多少，他便跚着方歩，很大方地説：</p>
<p>「隨你便吧！」</p>
<p>和尚不敢多寫，只替他寫了五十天。等到要問他兌現，他才走到人家的身邊，輕輕拍人家一下，說私話似的說道</p>
<p>「你好不明白！老師傅。虧你活這大年紀囉。這還要我出錢麽？我告訴你，我的名字就值錢哪。你現在就拿去化緣吧，人家一看見我大掌櫃都出了錢，就曉得這是頂好的事情，誰個還肯不捐呢？……嚇嚇，我的名字，好容易給人哩！」</p>
<p>煞尾這一通笑聲，會使對方感到顫慄的。</p>
<p>邊遠省份，是最莫明其妙的，軍隊要移防了，便叫人民籌集開拔費，要打仗了，便叫人民出軍火捐。因此，商會會長便遞給大掌櫃一張紙條，說他名下共該出銀二十元。他便當面把紙條子搓成一團，幾乎像駡似的嚷道：</p>
<p>「哼，我問你，你到底是幹嗎？我們是叫你做會長！不是叫你做强盗哪！」</p>
<p>但會長是個老狐狸精，並不生氣，反而用話來説服了他。他也明白不能為了二十元就封了舖子，而且全市貨物俱得提高賣價，則　回損失，也極容易，便破例挖一回自己的腰包，但還是怒氣冲冲，逢人駡道：</p>
<p>「媽的，這生意有啥做頭？還是關門大吉的好！」</p>
<p>街坊鄰舍，素來當面呌他大掌櫃，背後就戲呼他爲「大胖子」「肉牌坊」的，關於這種名稱上的嘲笑，到底還無傷於大鴉，等到二十元捐欵消息散佈出來時，另外給他取的新綽名，才算盡了刻薄的能事。那便是叫他「軟邊邊」。所謂「軟邊邊」即是鱉魚，他們認爲這東西是呌他走絶不成功的，足搭在牠的背上，一蹂就爬動了。有時他們不呌他「軟邊邊，」率性就呌他「踩倒爬」。這樣情形也有過的。</p>
<h3>父親的髮</h3>
<p>— 程兆翔</p>
<p>到了二十冒頭年紀，非但不能養活「家」，而且自己的生活也幾乎全然在發憂里過去時，聽到家中傳來的瑣碎的事，不免也要怔怔的發獃的了。</p>
<p>我不愛聽人家吐訴自己的寂寞，也不愛向人家吐訴寂寞。而到了從幾點真摯的感情里發覺一切歡欣，一切希望都離我太遠時，返顧我自己乃是感到真的寂寞的。我們在寂寞中長大：沒有歡欣，沒有希望，只有一副生活的桎梏不即不離的磨折我們。</p>
<p>我發現了更好的例子，我看到我寂寞了一輩子的父親的頭髮完全白了。</p>
<p>在幾年前我記到他的頭髮還不那樣的全白。有一回，是祭祖的時候，彎下腰去膜拜的父親，頭髮給微風撩了起來（他的頭髮乃是一種蓄辮剪去後的向後梳的長髮），乃開始看到輝閃在他頭上的不是黑的，而是銀樣的半白髮，佔據到十分之三子，我不禁默默的驚訝起來：</p>
<p>「呵！竟有如此之快嗎？」</p>
<p>幼時携着手多方安慰我上學去的父親，那時却還健朗。曾有一次是他抱着我而撩開他的頭髮——完全是黑的，白的幾乎找不出來。</p>
<p>相去祗十四五年，頭髮由烏黑變白了。那中間我們好像没有注意到牠怎樣發白的——而閃開在我眼前的是一個疑問，這些年間，他幹了些什麽呢。</p>
<p>到了近時，自己也偶爾在梳下的頭髮中發現一二莖白的了，把住了細細看着，心中也發生一點無告的落漠的悲哀。</p>
<p>在這里，我又從白髮的長成上悟出我們生活着的寂寞來。</p>
<p>回到家中，在第二天的破曉，就有這樣感覺的：矇朧中照例先聽到父親母親談着家中瑣事，從這一天的錢的來處說到柴米油鹽之類，我則照例對於這些事怕聽。然而怕聽也只好忍着。沙沙的嗓帶的次重音帶顫地推擊着我的耳膜滔滔不絶着；是父親。</p>
<p>「年老了也許都會嘮叨點罷！」</p>
<p>我想。年老了，的確說話要比別人多。當父親壯年的時候，他果敢，决斷，而沉默，且對於家中瑣碎事是從不顧問的。</p>
<p>我不願聽這聲音，我帶着喟感的心情把頭埋入被中了。</p>
<p>然而，一會——老了老了……那聲音推撼着我的心，我重新把頭探出被面時，看到了没有拉緊的窗帷外面，半個佝僂着的影子——而且恰好他的白髮頂鮮明的讓我看到了。</p>
<p>「呵呵，那麽大清早，又修鋤花樹了嗎？」</p>
<p>照例是氣咻咻一會直起腰來，一會傴下身去半生的事業算是給衰老吞蝕了去，而現在也只好把勞碌寄托在花草上罷。在晨陽中，我看到他那頭髮被亮光顫閃作一片紊亂的麻絲了！</p>
<p>於是我又悟出白髮的所以要爬上人們的頭的理由。到了那時，我們也依舊寂寞，頭髮也依舊通通要變白罷！現在我們雖少得找都找不出來。</p>
<p>三月三日，作於故鄉之老屋中。</p>

<p>一九三七年春</p>
<h3>那麽一個奇怪的人</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>我幸運得很，碰到過那麽一個奇怪的小火車站的站長，火車站小得可憐，山角的小廟宇一般。我第一次看見他在下着雪雨的冬天，他坐在售票室裏，雙脚擱在小檯子上，精濕的皮鞋旁邊有一包花生米和一碗熱黃酒。煤爐畢剝地響着，罅隙裏冒出蜘蛛絲一般的白烟。他痛駡那些買票的農民，現在他面前什麽人都沒有，就對着火爐打盹。到第十次碰見他也還是這樣……</p>
<p>不斷的饞涎滴在他胸前那塊髒得發亮的污垢的製服上。春天和夏天他把沙發搬到站後空地上，在那裏睡一整天，冬天——風一颳起來他就躱在售票室裏動都不動，喝着黃酒，等那些他以爲又愚蠢又慳吝的農民前來捱駡。</p>
<p>現在又是下着雪雨的冬天，仍然在那售票室裏。報站鈴一點響動也沒有。他無聊地在房間裏廵視着他底打票機，及那敞開的連鬼影都沒有的窗洞，和牆上掛着的帽子，寒暑表，滅火筒，紅綠號旗和各種大大小小的表格和文告等，——這一切都是異常熟悉而彷彿一點用處也沒有的麽物。</p>
<p>「好吧……可是你站在這裏幹什麽呀？」</p>
<p>他拍着那十年也沒有移動過的塗了紅漆的滅火筒好像在拍一個老友底肩膀，然後又像頑童似地對着壁上規規矩矩的圓掛鐘做一個鬼臉。</p>
<p>一月第一個禮拜天——曆上却是上一個禮拜二……站長自己知道年份月份和一個禮拜中的任何一天，從來沒有過錯誤，因此他像對他底屬員們——事務員，岔道夫，腳夫，知道他們在什麽時候做了什麽事並且缺點在那裏一樣，對日曆那一類的東西異常冷淡。……但是現在牠却使站長停下脚歩了。</p>
<p>這體氣壯旺的中年男子添濕了兩隻手指，動手發狼地撕去那些日曆紙——他無緣無故地唱着淫猥的歌調，哼呌着，恰像他正在動手剝去一個女人底衣服。</p>
<p>「不錯——是禮拜天呢！」</p>
<p>他自言自語地呻吟道……「如果我把今天當做禮拜六……做錯了一點事情——那多麽好玩呵！」他拿出一根牙籤深深地含在嘴裏，走到賣票的窗口俯下身去向外面張望。從站前通到站後去的甬道上潮濕，寂寞，草鞋和橡皮底鞋在那上面疏落地印着泥痕，人或動物——影子都没有。</p>
<p>我走到他後面——我推開門，一點聲音都没有……他已經把他底臉孔塞在窗洞上三十分鐘了。「站長，下班車快來了嗎？」他睬也不睬我，仍然呆望着外面濕漉漉的甬道。</p>
<p>每個禮拜天第一班車到這裏，有一個姓林的中學校長就會打他面前經過，和他簡單地問好，「你好嗎，站長？」——是站長每禮拜僅有一次的最大的快活。今天——禮拜天，那姓林的中學校長却一直到下午四點鐘還不曾來，他一直在盼望着……一點不知道我和他說了些什麽。</p>
<p>是的，每個禮拜天他都把他底壯健的臉堵塞住那小小的賣票的窗洞口……有時候別人不知道他在等候什麽……</p>
<h3>超乎俏皮的悲憤</h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>（讀書隨筆）</p>
<p>著名的報告文學家基希（Egon　Erwin　Kisch）説過：「報告文學者所描寫的地方和事象，他所嘗試的經騐，他所證明的歷史，他所探測的泉源，不應該一定要是遼遠的，稀有的，使人們難以接近的，在一個總是要想隱匿真相，因此總是找着謊話的世界里，我們的作家，只要能够捉得住他的對象就好。世上沒有比簡單的真實更奇異的，沒有比我們周圍的環境更富於異地風光的，也沒有比客觀的現象更美麗的事物。」</p>
<p>這是至言，是對於報告文學的作者們最好的教訓。我看了中流第八期上魯西良先生的初選，更深深地相信了這話的真實性。</p>
<p>基希曾經寫過二十三段關於我們的事情，合成了一部秘密的中國，而爲愛好真實的人們所傳誦。但是，在這裏，在這個古老的國家裏，每天每天，總有人在製造着謊話，在醜惡的上面蓋上錦繡，在荒亂的上面飾着平静，使人們看不見那真實，她還有更多的秘密，初選的作者所發掘的，　　是這秘密的一種。</p>
<p>作者借一個鄉長的口吻，述説　　縣裏某一次初選的情形，賄選的跑票員們，活躍地拉攏着鄉長。銀錢，酒菜，地位，禮物，什麽方法都施展出來了，鄉長們也决定了他們所要選舉的人物，一切都已定當，臨到選舉的時候，被一個縣政府的科員和一個兵士，挾到文廟大殿裏縣長的面前，不料縣長瞪着眼説：</p>
<p>「昨夜省政府密令，叫我這樣辦！我也以為你們亂選一陣是不合適的；既難檢票，又好起糾紛。現在就依省府的辦法，可是我先告訴你們：我寫這幾位都是你們縣裏德高望重的，你們誰要反對，就是搗亂份子。我對搗亂份子是不客氣的。」</p>
<p>說完了，縣長就去黑板上寫出四個名字來：督軍的侄子楊××，軍長的弟弟江××，前任縣長尤××，還有一個，却是「既沒有金錢，又沒有勢力，還没有資格」的泥腿漢老吳，這是被綁去做傀儡的，也就是正義和公平的招牌。以後是臨走時候的訓話：</p>
<p>「對你們説：出門時，你們誰要被拉，我就認爲被拉者是貪圖了賄賂；拉者是有意賄選。一併帶區，没話説，我給他一打二罰。」</p>
<p>「出了選舉的地方，跑票員們以爲他們已經如了約，就拉拉扯扯的請吃飯。可是這些鄉長們，既脅於縣長的訓話，艾慚愧於自己的爽約，沒辦法，只得撒開腿，跑掉了。</p>
<p>這故事是現實的，在中國，還顯見得十分不凡，但作者却能够運用諷刺的筆調，冷靜地，然而却又熱烈地描畫出來，使人們能够感覺到他的筆下的力量。這力量使你發笑，但當你還沒有笑出聲來的時候，却又立刻使你變成嚴肅了。這是因為蘊蓄在作者的心中的，不是俏皮，而是超乎俏皮的悲憤。雖然作者的名字顯得陌生，但那樣熟練的手法，平易而能動人的格調，在所謂報告文學裏面，也是不多見的。</p>
<p>不過，我以爲末了的一段，寫到這些鄉長們的覺醒，是好的，但却和通篇不能調和。作者並沒有將老韓的身世交代清楚，這個夾在泥腿漢中間的人物，竟至於説出「……我們有民衆，民衆就是力量。只要我們領導起來，救國救民族，都不成問題！」這未免存點不相稱。而且，那些鄉長們自己所要推選的標準，先就不大光明，我們且看這個被寫作第一人稱的鄉長的自述：</p>
<p>最初，我的票上决定了兩個人。一個是文校長，他和父親是朋友。請客送禮，比別人都來得實在。一個是何科長，他是教育界的領袖。我想以後向他薦幾個初小的教員。那兩個，我拿不定主意，可巧輪着俺家出訓練員了。我弟弟剛在小學畢業，父親怎肯讓他受訓？可是不能避免。我只得去托陳團長，呌他和聯莊會總隊長說說，不受訓，也不僱人受訓。因為僱人，得給人八畝安家田呀！果然，陳團長一說就行了。他對我的表示是：只要舉他，就算謝他了。我這不化錢的票，還能不寫他！弟弟呢，一心要考師範講述所。所長曾向人明白的說過：「這次以票取學生。」弟弟的要求，沒法推托。而所長也允許給我換換脚踏車的外帶，於是就又定了他。</p>
<p>我們十幾個不約而同了。——當然他們也都得着便宜。——</p>
<p>縣長强奸了民意，這些鄉長們覺悟到自己的被賣，却一點囙沒有想到自己其實早已出賣了自己。這種境界，離覺悟還很遠，把他們寫成了羣「熱忽忽地」的覺醒的羣衆，是不適宜的。</p>
<p>但除此以外，初選仍不失爲一篇很好的文章，尤其是在今日——連前進的創作家們也在「打油」的今日，牠是具有着嚴肅的意義的。</p>
<h3>兩種女性</h3>
<p>— 雙飛</p>
<p>『第三種人』，這是把男性分成三種；我現在把女性也分成兩種：</p>
<p>一種女性是面色紅潤，體態豐滿，精神常覺愉快的，這種女性被稱為『健美的女性』，她們很能在社會上活動。另一種女性則是面色憔悴，體態瘦弱，精神常覺悒鬱的；這種女性被稱爲『林黛玉式的女性』，她們在社會上就處於落伍的地位！</p>
<p>女性這兩種的不同，當然是由環境所支配的；健美的女性因為受了新時代的洗禮，所以體格能成壯健。而『林黛玉式的女性』，則仍是受着封建的縛束，所以體格衰弱，甚至引起生理上種種的病態！我們對於這種女性除過抱着很深的同情外，希望她們能改善生活的狀况。假使是因體虚血虧而成病的，我們願意介紹幾種婦女妙藥：通經活血的『月月紅』，養血調經的『女界寳』，對症調服，也能治病　之　　　强仁。</p>

<p>日本新任外相佐藤先生，很精彩的在就任之初來了一篇對華“平等外交”的宣言，聲言過去日本處處以特殊地位進行對華交涉的錯誤，而今後應一本平等精神與中國謀妥恊。這一“九一八”以來從未聽見過的大胆宣言，在日本國內國外，立刻博得了爱好和平者巨大的掌聲·於是，我們有些人也以爲日本政策眞有“轉𠮓”了。可是事實却沒有這麼容易·想來佐籐先生在發表大胆的宣言之後，究竟有些不大胆，或者，反對者的聲浪已隱隱而起了的原故罷，於是，趕着在宣言發表後二三天內，接二連三的更發表了許多補充的說明。在這些補充說明中着重着说：日本國策，是一貫不𠮓的，所變者只方法而已。我們可以看出佐籐先生在大胆的宣言發表之後，又在趕緊的把它逐步收回了。可是儘管佐籐十分善觀氣色，竭力把自己宣言中和平的成色冲淡，以適合反對者的胃口，而一種反對着他這一宣言的浪潮，還是在不可遏止的蕩漾開來了。於是，在距離宣言的發表不過四五天的光景，接着便泛起了一片不滿之聲，最後的一句話，是：“認識時局之錯誤”！接着的要求，是：外相與首相應連帶去職。聽着中外不少掌聲的佐藤，正在興高彩烈，而却兜頭來了一勺冷水；而國內國外不少的聽客們，𤍠烈的掌聲還沒有終了，接着便是一陣刺骨的陰風，弄得大家都目瞪口呆了。國際上出現了這樣一幕的滑稽悲喜劇眞足以使人嘆“觀止”的了。</p>
<p>然而從這一事，對於我們，倒是結結實實一番最好的敎訓。</p>
<p>過去我們有一部分人，始終還相信人家有一天會“回心轉意”的，這呌作“覺悟”。如說：“我如始終以誠意待人，人最後亦必以誠意待我也”的語，就是此意。然而事實上以一個龐大的國家機構，除非它就等於一部機器，可以隨人指揮，停開隨便，國家的機構，却並無如此容易。請問：以友邦維新六十年來，其繁榮蒸盛，根本是建築於對外軍事勝利之上的，而在今日，軍事的勝利更有一日千里之勢，不費吹灰之力而得了廣大的土地，這便宜今日到那裏去找？而在這樣一個軍車勝利邁越古今的順利形勢之下，要它中途停一下，拍一下它肩背說：“息一下罷！”這是事實上可能的嗎？而况今日的形勢，除非前面忽然遇到一個極大的障碍，使它根本不得前進，而它爲勢所逼，自己正也有欲停不得之苦，何况前面並無什麽的障碍，正顺利的很呢？故關於佐籐此次演出的滑稽悲喜劇，我們自己倒正可及時澈底“覺悟”一下，看出前方開來的戰車，除非趕快擲個炸彈過去，或是轟它一砲，這戰車却絕不會忽然在我們面前中途停下，就連“稍停片刻”也是不可能的　像佐籐那樣的“口惠而實不至”的演說，尚且不能存在，還何論其他！</p>
<h3>先農壇</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>“先農壇”在從前是“禁地”，是有九五之尊的帝王用來作祭典農事的，因之，在祀祭的大殿裏，陳列着各般的農具，當祭典的時侯，據說這農具也曾每年被“御用”過一次。壇址，相當的大，以前有一道高牆圍攏着，不使閑雜的人能够揷足。後來呢？城牆一樣的障礙物是拆除得沒有絲毫的餘留，這功得，的確不小，不論你是從北面號稱繁盛帶有點神秘性的“香廠”或是由西面穿過了“江南城隍廟”趕往大橋的往來的人們，就能够不必再沿了牆根兜上那末一個大圓圈，直接的，可以由被禁的壇裏橫穿過去。</p>
<p>跟着，這裏變成了公園，銅元幾枚就能飽覽個痛快，參天的松柏，把枝葉緊遮了人行的甬道，不讓太陽的毒臉刺傷了遊人的皮膚，一走進“二道壇門”，那一股凉爽的清新的氣息撲上鼻子，疲憊的心情便也隨了振奮起來。在從前這禁地是什麼樣子，我們沒有那種眼福，不能知道，不過，這時的設備想去不是以前遺留下的。</p>
<p>順了參差的樹幹，在濃密的地方有大的“茶棚”，白桌布籐靠椅，整潔的企待着一般的來客。假使你身邊有那末幾毛錢，不妨坐了下去，要是餓，也有小食，想運動一回麼？有地球之類不妨練一下身體。假使你想找個女人談會天，並不是什麼難事，只須留心的看着生意上的女人在樹叢中緩慢的踱過來，把眼睛向茶棚裏溜轉的當口，這機遇不可失掉，凑上去搭訕兩句，於是便輕巧的成功了。倘若這一切都與你無緣，你倘想舒散一下筋骨，好，信着脚步在花圃當中停留一會，呈在眼前的有不知名的雜色的花草，有煞费心機佈置成功的圖案的體形；看一下鐵絲籠裏的珍鳥，孔雀，獮猴之類，也會有點悠學。</p>
<p>進了第三道壇門，分正甬道左右的有兩方“祭壇”，爲了天地五形說不上來的什麽玩藝，石雕的山水和“指儀”則按規例的分置在某個方向。龍形的盤松低低地讓枝子灣下來一個“龍爪”，幾乎挨了人的頭，壯勁的攀籐爬上了頂尖蛇樣的繞纏着。登上高壇，永定門的城頭讓垜口伸過來懷抱了這三道壇牆的外圍，如果是在風凄月冷的夜間，如果是在絕了人跡的深更時候，四面的枝葉沙沙地嚮，在龍形蛇樣的松籐之下，彷彿有什麼鬼怪，而城牆無語的露出了巨魔般可怕的齒牙，不覺間就會毛骨悚然的。</p>
<p>曾經一度在這裏開過燦爛的花，“香廠”闢成了遊樂的市塲，胡同裏的姑娘們把香巢遷移到附近落成了的新房，壇的隔壁那城南遊藝傷的鑼鼓招來了天南地北的遊旅，過去不遠，就是“天橋”，每天，成夥的人兒會把壇裏茶棚佔據得不夠分配！</p>
<p>之後，香巢改成了市房，吃喝的塲所又搬到中心的地帶去，而招致遊旅的遊藝塲在緊張的氣喘下停止了最後的呼吸，於此，先農壇便落漠了。</p>
<p>本來，這地方近了城南，平時就怪偏僻的，除了香廠那幾條街以外，附近就缺少住居的人家。𤍠天還好些，一交秋令，北地天寒的程度是滿早的，秋風撩起了地上的黃沙時候，壇裏的游人少得可憐，上燈以後，除了小販偶爾的打這裏穿過，幾乎少有行人。於此，惟恐天下不亂的造謠專家透出了一個消息，說是這地方常有鬼靈精的出現，有聲有色，聽之能毛髮森豎，就此，壇的命運被可怕的氛氣深深地埋下去！</p>
<p>寂靜的夜裏，我夢想到那雄偉的御用過的農壇，現在，故都是投在沉暗的暮色裏，幾年不見，怕牠更沉沒下去了。</p>
<h3>讀廣告有感</h3>
<p>— 卓人</p>
<p>最近某舞廳因更換×××樂隊刋登巨幅廣告，以資號召“舞迷”，但是第二天×××舞廳也刋廣告云：“本廳原有樂隊，絕未更動一人，有人借名詐欺，特此鄭重聲明。”這種“張小泉起首老店”式的廣告戰，在上海已經是數見不鮮了。不過我不是　舞迷”，“起首老店”也好，“掛羊頭賣狗肉”也好，我因之却想到“商業道德”。</p>
<p>做生意是“將本求利”，把自己的東西說得好一點似乎未可厚非，除了賣苦瓜的，天下本無不　好”的廣告。但是剪刀未必是張小泉的出品最好，陸稿薦宰的也是普通的猪玀，然而一開剪刀店好像非張小泉不足以號召，賣肉的非掛塊陸稿薦招牌也好對不起“吃客，結果，使人無所適從，卽使有比張小泉更犀利的剪刀，此陸稿薦更鮮美的猪肉，也一網打盡了。</p>
<p>從前讀“商業英文”的時候，讀到一個很好的舉例：在一家理髮店的對面一家新的理髮店開張了，有一位顧客問老闆·“生意怎樣？”老闆微笑着回答：“到我們店里來的都是“上等人”，他們祇是做“販夫走卒　的生意的。”</p>
<p>他不在“本行”的裝璜富麗，座位舒適，招待週到，技師精良上面着眼，只輕巧地用“上等人”與“販夫走卒”來一比較，誰又願意不做“上等人”而做“販夫走卒”呢？—這是頗可傚法的廣告術。</p>
<p>魯迅先生逝世之後，坊間翻版書觸目皆是，我以二角八分大洋買了本定價四元的一折七扣翻版“雜感集”，但是翻到最後一頁的時候，赫然“版權所有，翻印必究”八個大字在焉，或許書賈比其他生意人高明一點，想得出那種“死無對證”的“幽默”。</p>
<p>然而商人道德淪亡矣！</p>
<h3>難民船</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>無邊灰濛的霧，捲走夕陽最後的光彩，海上的黃昏，顯得多麼岑岑與悽寂。</p>
<p>風不住地吹嚮着號角，在天際翻騰。海潮像調皮的孩子，不住地𨂃跳歡躍和歌唱；但又像是野心勃勃的政客，相互地爭持高下，攘奪地盤：不住地喊殺和囂嘯。</p>
<p>一帆危立的孤舟，任着浪潮的推擠，不住顚覆飄搖：百十個無家的流浪者，不分晝夜地兼程。儘他是孱弱的老者，無知的穉童和少壯的人，心同樣地冷漢岑寂。向前望，望不斷的海天，望不斷的渺茫！向後看，家鄕裏張掛着凶神的鬼臉。</p>
<p>死的陰影，披掛着每個人的心神。他們不像是詩人，呌不出海上黃昏的岑寂，也唱不出“落霞孤鶩”的詩句。對於一切，他們只有恐怖與憎恨。他們企圖衝上天去，把太陽摘下來搗成碎粉；因爲他們實在恨透牠的毒刻殘忍——旱災扯毁了他們生命的源泉：禾稼枯成了黃草，種子爛了合着焦泥；地面縫成龜背的斑裂，千年的古井也看見了底兒。毒辣的太陽迫着大家挖草根，剝樹皮，甚至吃死人的肉！</p>
<p>難災下慘厲的哀呌，，確像似浪潮的狂囂。</p>
<p>這浪潮，這海同樣使他們憎恨與憤怒；也抹着極濃的恐怖。是旱災過後的大熟年，苦寂的臉上，剛剛恢復一點兒笑意；離開他們許久的希望，也重新回復一點兒生機。可是水，那無邊的巨浪，冲毁農村的堤壩，冲毁他們生命的安全：吞滅許多人畜的生命與財產，逼迫他們離開祖宗生活的發祥地，茫茫裏踏</p>

<p>洪三年任滿，奉召偕賽返國。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>上流浪的途程，走過一個村荘一個鄕鎭，又一個縣城。</p>
<p>大夥兒跨高山，越峻嶺，也渡過紆廻的水；環廻過幾千里的路程。比遊牧的民族更多一點流動性。終年沒有一次安閒的睡，甜適的憧憬和夢，早遠遠地離開了他們，只有流浪與飢饉，終日在身側徘徊。</p>
<p>無論到什麼地方，很少得到同情與帮助；不能允許他們有多一點的停留。彷彿天地間就容不住他們這夥“多餘者”。一些帮閒的人物，更老愛替他們造下許多誣蔑的謠言：“黃河婆”是會使閉眼法，會畫符念咒的，偷了東西一時使你不覺察……他們生來就是這種賤相，行乞是祖傳的行業；每個人總要經受幾年流浪的苦味，才能安順地活到終老；在家鄕裏他們都還有着整幢的房子，整塊的田地……</p>
<p>就這樣一般人對他們更多了防範與仇視，咒咀和怨懟。為着維持地方上的“安寗”，他們老常遭受着“護送”出境的待遇——使流離疾苦的生命，憑添無限的難堪苦痛！</p>
<p>由陸地上被迫下了海，在茫茫的海上，又不知將揚帆何處？</p>
<p>誰都把持不住心的平衡，誰都瞧不定自己的生命，也更估不定明天將是怎樣的生活？大夥兒裏又不知是誰輪到了死亡？</p>
<p>海上的夜色一步步地深沉了。在昏濛慘暗的霧的籠罩和浪潮不斷的襲擊裏；大水衝入村子的回憶，又在大夥兒的心頭攪擾了；這悲慘的回憶使他們恐怖得發抖。往往會因爲船身的顚簸搖動而惹起大𨺑悽厲絕望的哭和呌喊，祈求和禱告—雖然他們是被派充天地间的“多餘者”，但他們却都非常愛惜自己的生命；在伙伴之間互相依傍着，照顧着；過去是陌生的不同居處的人們，現在却變成比嫡親兄弟姊妹更親熱。</p>
<p>在長途上雖然他們也生育着，但遠敵不過死亡：三四百人的大夥兒，就只落得百十條生命——這生命，一重重綑束着飢寒和疾病，一步步迫近了死亡。他們舒不出一口比較輕鬆的氣息，祇有哀歎着人世的陰慘！</p>
<p>無邊的黑暗，重重的慘霧，配合着狂風猛浪，流浪人的心，更迷茫了！</p>
<h3>灰鶴</h3>
<p>— 朱露</p>
<p>在北國古城，帝王的大廟裏，滿是壯嚴的遺蹟，那紫金的庭頂，圓粗的殿柱，古老楠木的靠椅，那在潔白得像羊脂一樣的石階上，雕刻着一條條，象徵着威嚴和暴虐，舞着爪牙的龍。</p>
<p>在古廟裏，那點綴着的香爐牌位，都被當做古董，保護着。在陰森的大殿外，在粗大樹林裏，有着空中的女王，一羣羣的灰鶴，在樹蔭裏飛翔。</p>
<p>在那古老寂靜的氣氛裏，祇有它，一羣羣的灰鶴，代表着年青的一夥，它有着灰色靈巧的軀幹，灰色絨一樣的翼膀，灰色的頭，……當它在黃金色的陽光裏，張開着灰白的翅膀，穿出了樹林，在天空裏飛翔，那陽光照耀着牠，顯得那樣的美麗。</p>
<p>它有着倔强的性格，年年都飛到那永遠一圈的樹林，它不會更變到另一的地方，錯飛到別處去。</p>
<p>年年，牠從嚴寒曠野的西伯利亞飛來，飛到那飛舞着風沙的古城，依照着牠祖先的例子，每次，老祇停留在一圈的樹林裏，牠那樣喜愛着自由，當人家吵鬧着，掀弄着牠居處，牠就會在雲靄裏消逝。</p>
<p>那圈樹林，已用着鐵絲攔住，阻止着遊客們的跑進•當在春天，明媚的春光照着，一羣羣灰鶴，在樹林裏出現，在靜寂得像埋在墳墓裏的太廟，在播散着春光的種籽，在樹蔭裏唱着春天的歌，那樣自由激動的歌。</p>
<p>常常，那一只只勇敢的灰鶴，扭動着尖嘴，張開着翅膀，昻起着頭，衝向着浮雲裏，……陽光閃着它美麗的身子，……它飛着，勇敢地飛着，……激昻地向着燦爛的陽光裏衝去。</p>

<h3>「慈母曲」寫些什麽？</h3>
<p>一個道地中國式「良妻賢母」型的女性，嫁了一個懶而愛酒的丈夫。丈夫既無出息，她除了爲他盡一份女人的可憐的義務，生出一大羣孩子以外，還得辛苦劬勞，靠一雙手來維持家庭，替丈夫打酒，替孩子縫衣補襪，在這種悲苦的生活裏，青春去了，頭髮白了，丈夫顧自己吐出最後一個呼吸，從此一切完事。孩子大了。男的娶了，女的嫁了，結果是大家快快樂樂享受青春去了。一個有着成羣兒女的白髮老母，却變成了東飄西泊，無家可歸的人，不得不到養成堂裏終老去。——聯華公司鉅片「慈母曲」，所描寫的就是這樣的故事。</p>
<p>這自然是倫理的悲劇，但我們就是中國女性的傳統的悲劇也不妨。現在「慈母曲」就將在上海金城大戲院公映了，不知觀衆在感動流淚之餘，有什麽另外的感想没有？</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrives in Nanjing from Taiyuan</h3>
<p>He Yingqin and Others Wait at the Airport to Greet Him, Having Participated in the Review of Various Troops in Suiyuan, They Began Returning to Their Original Defense Posts Yesterday.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang, having attended the memorial service for soldiers and civilians who died in the defense of Suiyuan, departed Suiyuan on the 17th for Taiyuan. After resting for one night, he, along with Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, Secretary Lin Baisheng, and eleven attendants, took Eurasia Aviation Corporation's flight No. 18, a Junkers chartered plane, back to Nanjing on the morning of the 18th. The plane took off from Taiyuan at 9:15 a.m. on the 18th and flew directly to Nanjing without stopping along the way. Due to the headwind, the flight time was slightly longer, arriving at Ming Palace Airport at 1:40 p.m. Those who had heard the news and went to the airport to welcome him included He Yingqin, Yu Feipeng, Peng Xuepei, Zeng Zhongming, Gu Zhenglun, Wang Gupan, and more than a dozen others. After Wang got off the plane, he looked energetic and shook hands with each of the welcoming personnel. Then, he changed into a car and returned to his residence. Chu, Wang, and the secretary also returned to their respective residences with Wang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] The various troops that came to Suiyuan to participate in the review began to depart on the 18th to return to their original defense posts. Cavalry Division Commander Peng Yubin led his troops back to their defense post on the 18th. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Chairman Wang and others flew from Taiyuan to Nanjing at 8:30 a.m. on the 18th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] On the 17th, Chairman Wang met with reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in Taiyuan, as well as correspondents stationed in Taiyuan from other newspapers. The reporters raised questions about Sino-Japanese relations, the Communist bandits in the Northwest, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's health. Chairman Wang answered them one by one, speaking for about 30 minutes. Here is a record of Chairman Wang's remarks: (1) According to recent statements from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the arrival of the economic investigation group in China, there is much talk again about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. This is certainly what the Chinese people desire. However, past events are deeply imprinted in the minds of our entire nation and will never be forgotten. Therefore, no matter what, preparations for resistance must not be relaxed in the slightest. We must follow the declaration of the Third Plenary Session and work hard. For every minute we have, we must make a minute's worth of preparations. At the same time, we must always be prepared to make sacrifices. (2) If the Communist Party accepts the declarations and resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, then the central government should give them a path to reform. However, this is by no means tolerating communism. In the past, tolerating communism meant allowing the Communist Party to organize and propagate. Now, in this time of national resistance, we only have one path: that is, for the entire nation to unite and work together under a single goal and a single leadership for national resistance. Not only can the Soviet government and the Red Army not exist, but even the Communist Party's organization and propaganda cannot be tolerated by the doctrine of unity for national salvation. The theory of class struggle will inevitably incite riots and break up the entire front of national resistance. (3) It was reported a few days ago that Mr. Chiang will take a leave of absence for a month or two after returning to Nanjing, which may be true. However, this is only to prevent minor matters from disturbing Mr. Chiang's health so that he can recover sooner. As for major national policies, they will still be the responsibility of Mr. Chiang. We love and care for Mr. Chiang and sincerely hope for his early recovery. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>

The entire amount of pig iron produced should be purchased by the company and not allowed to be sold externally; 2. The pig iron needed for steel manufacturing should be reserved according to the required quantity; 3. The Japanese iron company has the first right to purchase steel refining shuttles; 4. The Japanese iron company has the right of first refusal for all by-products of the Longyan Mine.

<h3>European Travel Notes</h3>
<p>— By Our European Correspondent, Lieshan</p>
<p>Twenty-two: The Logic of German Newspapers</p>
<p>Dr. Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda of Germany, is most proud of the fact that the tone of German newspapers has been unified under his command. Newspapers should be tools of the party and the government; this is the news policy of the National Socialist Party. National Socialists are particularly proud of the fact that German newspapers are all "unique and different from newspapers in other countries, not following the tide," exclusively publishing unethical news. In other words, the moral standards of German newspapers have been raised.</p>
<p>For example, last winter, King Edward VIII of England was in love with an American divorcee, which caused a conflict with Prime Minister Baldwin. Newspapers in various countries, even in England, reported extensively on this event. The only exceptions were German newspapers. German newspapers all published a notice stating that this event was an internal affair of the United Kingdom. German newspapers did not want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, so they had to forgo this news. Therefore, they did not mention a word about it from beginning to end. It was not until after Edward VIII abdicated that many newspapers hurriedly issued extra editions, although by this day, most Germans already knew this story.</p>
<p>The opposite was the Xi'an Incident. When Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was detained, German newspapers immediately reported, based on news from the Japanese Domei News Agency, that he had been killed. On the other hand, they insisted that Mr. Zhang Xueliang was a communist. Thus, they used this as a pretext to attack the Communist Party at the expense of the Chinese. This rhetoric was no different from defending Japan's Far East policy. After Mr. Chiang Kai-shek returned unharmed and Chinese people in embassies around the world proved that China was a unified country, some German newspapers changed their original attitude, but some still said that the Chinese value face. Did Mr. Chiang Kai-shek lose face (?); was his position shaken? Therefore, the future of China is not optimistic. They even said that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's leave of absence was purely a matter of face. In fact, we Chinese people are currently very aware of the seriousness of the national crisis and the need for unity. After the Xi'an Incident, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek not only did not lose "face," but on the contrary, his reputation among the people only increased. Because China needs Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. What the Chinese people cherish today is not Mr. Chiang Kai-shek personally, but the unity that has been achieved through great hardship.</p>
<p>In fact, the Xi'an Incident was precisely an internal affair of China. If German newspapers were willing to maintain their consistent stance of not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, then not only should editorials have a different attitude, but they should not even be mouthpieces of the Japanese Domei News Agency. Especially the rhetoric in the Ming Hsin News. We feel that this newspaper's comments on Sino-Japanese affairs are always more Japanese than the Japanese themselves. Perhaps this is where the straightforwardness of the Germans lies!</p>
<p>Twenty-three: What We Dare Not Say</p>
<p>In the eyes of Europeans, we Chinese are naturally an incomprehensible people, and similarly, Chinese customs are also an unfathomable mystery. Conversely, from the perspective of us Chinese, there are also many things in Europe that are unbelievable, such as the European concept of family.</p>
<p>Recently, I met a family. The father is a factory owner, and the mother is a widowed woman who has remarried. Her first marriage produced two sons. Traditionally, these two sons also live with their stepfather. The mother's first marriage only produced one daughter, a very presentable young woman of eighteen. Although the father is not yet fifty years old and has a very strong physique, the mother and daughter often argue about inheritance issues, even in front of the father.</p>
<p>Once, this family held a small banquet, and I was one of the guests. After the meal, everyone sat and chatted. Inadvertently, the topic turned to inheritance issues. The mother said, "Sir, look how unreasonable my daughter is. She told her father to give her all the property when he makes his will, and she will provide for my later years. Naturally, this is impossible." The daughter said, "Dad, isn't that right? After the inheritance is given to me, won't I take care of Mom? Isn't that right, Dad?" After she finished speaking, she gave her father a kiss affectionately. As a result, a conflict arose between the mother and daughter in front of the guests. As for the father, he just smiled and said nothing.</p>
<p>What we can understand in this situation is that the mother is thinking of her two sons. If the mother receives all the inheritance, then her two sons can at least get some. Precisely because of this, the young woman is unwilling. She naturally does not want her two half-brothers to share in this inheritance. However, what we cannot understand is that everyone is discussing his afterlife problems so openly in front of the father. We are not talking about any taboos, but what kind of feelings will such a conversation evoke in a healthy father! What makes us feel particularly strange is that all the guests present participated in the discussion, as if this were a very ordinary event. Everyone forgot about the father.</p>
<p>Europeans are, after all, Europeans. We Chinese would never dare to say such things.</p>
<p>Twenty-four: German Diplomats</p>
<p>A German said, "We have military men who are like military men, and we also have diplomats who are like military men. Part of Germany's tragedy lies here." Many people believe that the person primarily responsible for Germany's failure in the last European war was the German diplomatic corps. Some even say that in German history, apart from Bismarck, it is impossible to find a first-rate diplomat, although Germany has produced many famous generals.</p>
<p>The "Third Reich" is currently suffering from the same problem: a lack of good diplomatic talent. In all fairness, Europeans generally feel more terror toward Soviet Russia than toward Germany. But Germany does not have someone like Litvinov, so everyone feels that Germany is particularly terrifying. In recent years, Germany has been trying to forge a new path in diplomacy, but whether it will work is naturally a question.</p>
<p>One example: Last autumn, Dr. Greiser, the president of the Danzig Free City Council, represented Danzig at the League of Nations. After he finished his speech, he raised his right hand and gave a Hitler salute to the representatives of various countries. This not only caused the newspaper reporters from various countries in the audience to laugh, but even some of the diplomatic corps from various countries in the hall could not help but laugh. Dr. Greiser was angry. When he left the hall, he passed by the newspaper reporters' audience and specially made a face at everyone. The reporters from various countries naturally refused to let go, so a dispute arose. As a result, British Foreign Secretary Eden said that he did not see the grimace of Dr. Greiser, and the storm was temporarily calmed. The next day, newspapers from various countries said that Dr. Greiser's mistake was in regarding the League of Nations meeting in Geneva as an Arab street, which is why this joke occurred.</p>
<p>Another example: German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Mr. Ribbentrop (the signatory of the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Pact"), recently presented his credentials to King George VI of England and, instead of bowing according to British custom, he also gave a Hitler salute. In the eyes of the conservative British people, this was simply a deliberate insult. The British newspapers' antipathy toward this matter is naturally reasonable. According to the Hitler salute, in addition to raising the right hand, one must also shout: "Heil Hitler!" Why shout "Heil Hitler" to the King of England is something we cannot guess no matter what. Mr. Ribbentrop is a key figure currently in charge of German diplomacy. Perhaps he hopes to gain the respect and awe of the British in this way. If he really has such a thought, then he has misunderstood the British.</p>
<p>A French newspaper said that Russia and Italy are also new-style political systems, but their ambassadors bowed to the King of England as usual. Why is Germany especially happy to be an exception? I remember a joke that divides diplomats and women into two types of people. When a girl says "no," it means "maybe"; when she says "maybe," she has already agreed. A clever woman will never say the word "yes." The opposite is true of diplomats. A diplomat's "yes" is only equal to "maybe." When he says "maybe," it is already a "no." For example, Mr. Zhang asks Mr. Li to help with something. Mr. Li is a straightforward person who can directly refuse and say, "I can't." But if Mr. Li is a diplomat, he should say, "Maybe," or "Let me try."</p>
<p>The straightforward character of the Germans is sometimes lovely, but when applied to the diplomatic arena, it will make others "baffled."</p>
<p>Twenty-five: A French Female Reporter on German Men</p>
<p>Although Germany and France are only separated by the Rhine River, the two sides are two different worlds. Not only are the races, languages, and customs different, but even daily life has great differences. For example, good grooming is a habit of French women; even some men apply rouge and powder. Germany, on the other hand, is the opposite. Except for women in large cities, most German women are rough and do not carry powder compacts. Precisely because of this difference, hearing a French woman's comments on German men is naturally a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>About half a year ago, I accidentally met a French female reporter. When she heard that I also understood something about the current situation in Germany, our conversation focused on German issues. She said that for many years, she had been traveling to various parts of Germany almost once a year, with the purpose of listening to music. But since Hitler came to power, she had to cancel this customary trip because Germany no longer had real musicians. In her opinion, Hitler's crimes in art were more serious than everything else!</p>
<p>She said, "....German men? Ah! What a group of people who don't understand romance! Almost every German man is a soldier, at least containing the air of a soldier. The characteristic of a soldier is that he can give orders and obey orders. German men obey orders in the barracks during the day and give orders to their wives when they return home at night. This has almost become a habit. German men are the superiors of German women...."</p>
<p>"German men also have many advantages," she continued. "For example, they are good at organizing, their lives are disciplined, they have perseverance, they have a precise attitude when studying, and they have a complete theory, especially on political issues. Sometimes this theory is very wrong, but they have confidence and believe it is correct....However, what use are all these things to us women? They don't understand women, or they don't want to understand her. When they talk to you, they either tell you how good military exercises are, or they tell you that someone's theory has some weakness in some point, or they explain the wonderful use of some new type of machinery. We women want to hear this kind of dry and tasteless rhetoric, even war. You see, sir, this is the German man!"</p>
<p>"....What we women need to hear is tenderness, not a serious life problem. What we need is someone who understands our hearts a little, not a warrior. I often wonder if most German men understand the meaning of life at all?...." This was her conclusion.</p>
<p>This female reporter's statement is, of course, not without its pertinent points. However, we feel that letting French women criticize German men is like a Shandong man in the eyes of a Suzhou girl. The starting point is completely different.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Sincerity and Trust</h3>
<p>— Beginning</p>
<p>Recently, some people have been very optimistic about national affairs because they have seen a new spirit of unity in the country. Others are pessimistic because they feel that this spirit of unity may disappear as easily as a fleeting flower.</p>
<p>Whether this spirit of unity can be sustained and whether national affairs can ultimately be optimistic, I believe, depends on the existence of two attitudes among the entire nation. What are those two attitudes? One is sincerity, and the other is trust.</p>
<p>To wholeheartedly accept these two attitudes, we must first ruthlessly point out our own shortcomings of insincerity and distrust. What time is it now? Can we still afford to avoid seeking medical treatment?</p>
<p>It must be frankly stated that until the present, although the entire nation has awakened to the idea of unity and cooperation, our actions may not fully correspond to this awakening. We still cannot avoid being insincere in our treatment of others, and we still cannot avoid being distrustful of others. If these two attitudes are not eliminated, the so-called unity will be like a paper lantern that cannot withstand even a slight breeze or light rain and will reveal its broken original form.</p>
<p>Sincerity means having nothing to hide or conceal and showing others that there are no hidden motives. If there is nothing to hide or conceal, then whether it is merit, fault, right, or wrong, it will be as clear as the sun in the sky, and everyone will be able to see it. At the very least, it will not arouse suspicion or misunderstanding. Throughout the past, many unexpected disputes encountered by those handling foreign affairs have been caused by insincere attitudes. As for showing others that there are no hidden motives, it involves the motive for doing things and is even more important than the previous point. If we promote something on the surface but harbor other calculations in our hearts or deliberately feint to the east while attacking the west, showing a straight face but concealing ulterior motives, that is even more likely to spoil things. Being frank and natural means having nothing to hide, and being sincere means that others will naturally not suspect that there are other motives. Sincerity is the general meaning of frankness and sincerity.</p>
<p>Trust means treating others with complete sincerity. Today, the Chinese people face the same destiny, bear the same tasks, and walk the same path. Since we want to hold hands and move forward together, how can we not treat each other with complete sincerity? Take resisting the enemy and defending against insults, for example. Under this general goal, the Chinese people should eliminate all suspicions, abandon all old grievances, and work together wholeheartedly. If there are still people harboring ulterior motives, thinking that some people are destined not to participate in the fortress of resisting the enemy and defending against insults, that is simply implementing a policy of suicide. A thinker once said something wise: Faith can produce the facts that are believed in. Conversely, without faith, the facts that are believed in will naturally never be produced. This statement can also be found in many examples in our ordinary interpersonal relationships. For example, there is a Mr. Zhang who is very good to Mr. Li, but Mr. Li does not trust Mr. Zhang, harboring ulterior motives and thinking that Mr. Zhang has no good intentions. Therefore, his attitude toward Mr. Zhang also changes. If this continues, even a good friendship will break down. People without faith often play out tragedies. They may not know that they are the creators of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Sincerity and trust are a ring; it cannot be formed if one is missing. If you are insincere to others, how can you ask them to trust you? If you cannot trust others, how can others be sincere to you? Therefore, in the present time when "the country will be destroyed any day now," we Chinese people, regardless of whether we are high or low, whether we are in the government or in the private sector, or what social class we belong to, should treat each other with sincerity and meet each other with trust. Only in this way will the so-called unity not become a superficial and forced union.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that the above-mentioned platitudes have the suspicion of "speaking on behalf of others." Then please pay attention to whether all Chinese people now have a common demand and a common program of action. Leaving aside right and wrong, before the theory and program of action are consistent, sincerity and trust may still be said to be not tolerated by strategy. Now that everyone is clearly calling for national salvation and survival in the same voice, can we still use such words to cover up and shirk responsibility?</p>
<p>Recently, many people have paid attention to the psychological transformation and construction of the people. We believe that sincerity and trust are the foundation of the psychological construction of the entire nation.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Speech Expresses Hope that Britain and France Will Not Doubt Italy</h3>
<p>His Visit to Africa Has No Hidden Secrets, Italy Wants to Live in Peace with All Countries, Belgian King to Visit England to Discuss Neutrality</p>
<p>⊙ Tripoli Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held a ceremony here today to unveil a bronze statue of Caesar and gave a speech expressing hope that Britain and France would no longer doubt Italy. First, he said that he would not forget the League of Nations' attempt to block Italy's breathing. Then, he said that his visit to Africa had no hidden secrets or intention to invade others. The so-called democratic countries are making sensational propaganda, which is quite strange. In fact, Italy is willing to live in peace with the world both within and outside the Mediterranean Sea. Italy is willing to cooperate with anyone who expresses the same desire. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] King Leopold III of Belgium is now scheduled to come here on the 22nd of this month for a three-day stay to hold important talks with the British authorities on the issue of this country's neutral status, especially the fulfillment of the obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. What Belgium wants to obtain is "to have its neutral status guaranteed by the great powers, in other words, to have the great powers guarantee that no other country's troops will pass through the country to resist an aggressor." This is contrary to the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and Article 16 of the Covenant. According to the general impression, Belgium may abandon its claim to "guaranteed neutral status" and only request the lifting of the obligations arising from the Locarno Treaty in order to restore full military sovereignty. As for the obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, they should still be adhered to in good faith. (Havas, Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Two Million Workers in Paris Stage Half-Day General Strike</h3>
<p>Protesting the Bloody Incident in the Suburbs, Implementing the People's Front Platform, Dissolving Fascist Groups</p>
<p>[Paris] Two million workers in the entire city staged a half-day general strike this morning in response to a notice from the General Confederation of Labor to protest the bloody incident in Clichy yesterday. The workers also held demonstrations in the factories and uniformly resumed work in the afternoon to show strict discipline. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Workers in various industries in the Parisian region affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor went on strike for half a day this morning and ended at noon. Public transport workers, according to the orders of the General Confederation of Labor, should not have participated in the strike, but they also stopped working and even resumed work early at about 11:00 a.m. so that workers outside the city could use public transport to come to Paris and resume work in the afternoon. In addition, all newspapers were published as usual, and civil servants also worked as usual. The city was very quiet. Political groups held lengthy talks to discuss how to deal with the changing situation. The People's Front held a meeting in the Clichy City Hall last night, attended by 3,000 people. The Secretary-General of the Communist Party, Doraire, and the leader of the far-left wing of the Socialist Party, Member of Parliament Bevan, gave speeches, demanding that the government dissolve all fascist groups, implement the entire People's Front platform, and purge the police organs. Subsequently, a resolution was passed advocating the establishment of a joint committee of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party in order to adopt various means to protect the people. The meeting ended without incident. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The order for a half-day strike issued by the General Confederation of Labor last night seems to have been complied with by workers in various industries in the Parisian region. As a result, the activity in Paris this morning was not as great as usual. Shuttle buses stopped running from 7:00 a.m. Many citizens, because the strike order was issued late at night and they were not notified, waited for trains at the underground train station, but the underground trains had also been ordered to stop running, and they did not start running until 11:00 a.m. In addition, although employees and civil servants of public utilities worked as usual, the General Confederation of Labor ordered them to "adopt a method to show solidarity with other workers." It is noted that the strike movement is limited to the Paris region, and the situation is very quiet. As of 8:00 a.m., no incidents have occurred. (Havas, Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Paris Trade Union Coordination Committee recently issued a declaration to the workers of Paris, urging all workers to abide by discipline and not take any excessive actions. The purpose of holding a half-day general strike this time is to express the will of labor. What is this will? That is: ㊀ All fascist groups should be immediately dissolved in their entirety; ㊁ Colonel de la Rocque, the leader of the "French Social Problems Research Party," which was reorganized from the former Croix-de-Feu, should be immediately arrested; ㊂ All anti-communist elements in the military, police, and public administration organs should be purged. In addition, the declaration also stated that the general strike was not intended to oppose the People's Front government. "The People's Front government should still be allowed to continue to hold power. The purpose of our general strike is nothing more than to support the government in its efforts to fight against the enemies of the people and all elements who have been bribed by foreign countries."

<h3>Various French Left-Wing Factions Hold Meetings, Cracks in the Popular Front Deepen</h3>
<p>Blum's Position Not Expected to Be Shaken; Interior Minister Announces Investigation into Bloody Incident</p>
<p>[Paris] Following the clashes between the fascist Social Studies Party and the Communist Party in the suburb of Clichy last night, which led to a bloody incident, it is generally believed that the position of the Blum cabinet will not be jeopardized. The General Confederation of Labor is also paying close attention and is determined not to create difficulties for the Popular Front government. The Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, Stonehouse, recently visited Prime Minister Blum and assured him that the unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor plan to hold a half-day general strike tomorrow at noon to protest. However, public utilities and civil servants are not included in the strike, so the local order is not expected to be affected. Today, the situation in the capital was as normal as usual, quiet throughout the day, with no incidents occurring. The police also did not take special preventive measures to protect public institutions and the Prime Minister's residence. Cabinet members held a meeting at 7:30 PM, which lasted for two hours. During the meeting, Interior Minister Daladier reported that a judicial investigation is currently underway, and the government has decided to take severe measures, strictly punishing anyone who violates the law. In addition, appropriate measures will be taken to maintain public order and social peace. After the cabinet meeting, cabinet members jointly issued a letter to the people of Paris, earnestly advising residents not to participate in any demonstrations that could disrupt public peace. They also stated that the working people have loyally supported the Popular Front government for ten months, which is commendable, and the government will continue to trust them. In the future, everyone should maintain a calm attitude and be wary of provocative actions, not to be fooled by them. In addition, various groups belonging to the Popular Front in Clichy held a meeting in the city hall tonight, which was approved by the government authorities beforehand, but only on the condition that the meeting be held inside the city hall. About three thousand people attended the meeting. At that time, some people were in groups on the streets, discussing yesterday's incident, but no other incidents occurred. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The parliamentary delegation of left-wing parties recently convened a meeting in the afternoon regarding the bloody incident in the suburb of Clichy yesterday. It was decided to send a delegation to visit Prime Minister Blum tomorrow morning to state the views of the left-wing parties on this incident. During the meeting, representatives of the Communist Party insisted that the fact that the French Social Studies Party convened a meeting in the working-class area of Clichy yesterday was an intentional provocation. Therefore, they demanded that various fascist-like groups be immediately disbanded. They also believed that the government's recent change in policy, the "suspension of implementation" of various social legislations stipulated in the Popular Front platform, has caused deep unease among the working class. For this reason, the Communist Party demanded that the government continue to implement various social legislations, especially the special grant system for the elderly unemployed, which should be quickly passed. The chairman of the Radical Party parliamentary group, Cambon, repeatedly stated that the party is determined to continue to support the Blum cabinet. However, from the perspective of the Radical Party's theory, freedom of thought and assembly is the primary right of all French citizens, and all parties must be able to enjoy it. The left-wing independent parliamentarian, Perret, said that the government must change its current economic policy, as this policy is too lenient towards the wealthy class and is not in line with the Popular Front's social program. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the incident in the suburb of Clichy, the Popular Front government will continue to lead the country. Although some quarters say that this incident could cause discord between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the confrontation between the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist-Communist Party within the Popular Front is even more serious than the confrontation between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The Radical Socialist Party has expressed opposition to the proposal for a half-day strike in the Paris area. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party want to investigate the responsibility for the incident. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Temps, praised the courage of the police in maintaining law and order, saying, "From the police chief to the investigation team members, all have fulfilled their duties, which is a credit to the republican government and the nation." The Socialist Party's newspaper, Le Populaire, published an article by Blum's confidant, Rosenfeld, which stated, "The responsibility of the police at the time of the incident must be thoroughly investigated. Whether the superiors were too panicked and failed to direct properly, or even allowed their subordinates to act arbitrarily, hoping to alienate the Popular Front government and the working class, should be punished according to the law." The Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, stated, "The government must punish the criminals, cleanse the various administrative agencies, and also have a way to control those who want to imitate the actions of General Franco in Spain and cause civil unrest in France."

Fortunately, he was not seriously injured and has been taken to the hospital for treatment. The woman, a former journalist, has been arrested. As for the motive, according to the woman's confession at the police station, "He caused me to lose my lover. Everyone knows this woman, there is no need to say it.

<p>Three Bombing Incidents in Jerusalem in One Day; British Authorities Consider Curbing the Unrest</p>
<p>⊙Jerusalem Three bombing incidents occurred here tonight, injuring a total of seventeen people, several of whom were seriously injured. The first incident occurred on a major street at 7:00 PM, when there were many pedestrians, injuring sixteen people, including one policeman and four children. Shortly after, two bombs were thrown into a café set up by an Arab on a major street, injuring seven Arabs, two of whom were seriously injured and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Before long, the third bombing incident occurred. A bomb was also thrown into a café opened by Arabs in the suburbs, injuring four people. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, in response to questions in the House of Commons today regarding the recent assassinations and riots in Palestine, considered them extremely regrettable. Ormsby-Gore stated that he was satisfied to hear that the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and other members of the Arab Higher Committee expressed outrage at the atrocities. However, illegal actions continue to this day. Ormsby-Gore also said that this matter occurred after a long period of unrest last year, so it is extremely difficult to maintain security. He recently consulted with the Palestine Higher Committee on methods to prevent riots. The Higher Committee will arrive in Palestine on Friday, at which time it will discuss emergency measures with the local military authorities. As for whether a state of martial law will be declared, Ormsby-Gore stated that the government is very unwilling to actively engage in it until it is certain that martial law can deal with the matter. When asked whether these acts of violence were directed by a central organization, Ormsby-Gore replied that these matters, regardless of where they come from, are the actions of local groups and are limited in nature, and have no relationship with the Higher Committee.

<h3>British and Japanese Naval Main Battleship Caliber</h3>
<p>The Dispute Between 14-inch and 16-inch Will Affect Battleship Tonnage Issues</p>
<p>[London] According to reports, the Japanese government will refuse to accept the main battleship caliber (14 inches) specified in the 1936 London Naval Treaty. Naval sources recently stated that even if this news is true, the United Kingdom does not intend to make any changes to its naval shipbuilding plan from 1936 to 1938. According to the opinion of most experts, a 35,000-ton battleship is suitable for installing 14-inch caliber guns, because the weight of the battleship can be saved, and the armor can be thickened, thereby strengthening the battleship's ability to resist artillery fire. As for 16-inch caliber guns, they can only be installed on 45,000-ton battleships, but the United Kingdom does not intend to build this type of battleship at present. If Japan decides to build battleships of 35,000 tons or more in the future, the British Admiralty may stipulate the construction of 45,000-ton battleships in its naval shipbuilding plan from 1938 to 1939 to respond. In addition, naval sources also said that the attitude adopted by the Japanese government will also have an impact on the Soviet Pacific Fleet. An agreement has been reached in principle between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union on naval negotiations, with the United Kingdom accepting a guarantee clause for the Soviet Pacific Fleet, that is, if Japan does not respect the qualitative restrictions specified in the London Naval Treaty, the Soviet Pacific Fleet will also be free from the restrictions of this measure, but the Soviet Union must immediately notify the United Kingdom in the event of such a situation. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Japan's refusal to accept the main battleship caliber (14 inches) specified in the 1936 London Naval Treaty, The Times recently commented that if the main battleship caliber is increased from 14 inches to 16 inches, the impact in the future will inevitably lead to a country using "technical" reasons as an excuse to increase the battleship tonnage to more than 35,000 tons, and thus naval shipbuilding competition will never end. It is known that this competition is not beneficial to any country. If the Japanese government can accept the restriction of the 14-inch caliber before April 1, this situation can be avoided. Otherwise, mankind's most insane behavior will be seen again today. In other words, the next half month is the only opportunity for countries around the world to prevent this action. If it is missed, the naval armaments of countries around the world will be engaged in unrestricted competition, and who should bear the responsibility will be obvious at that time. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will make a decisive decision, and that the content of the reply they submit will be better than what is rumored outside.

<p>[London] Today's news is that the United Kingdom and Germany are currently in the process of concluding a treaty to exchange naval construction plans every year. It is reported that the newly appointed British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, hopes that the treaty can be signed by both parties before taking a detour through New York to Japan. However, the Soviet Union happened to propose holding a European nine-nation naval conference at this time, which led to the delay of the treaty. (National dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Navy Department today published a notice inviting private shipyards to bid for the construction of a new battleship approved by Congress. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of this new ship is approximately US$50 million. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>"Female Lindbergh"?? Encircling the Globe by Air</h3>
<p>Departing from East to West Yesterday</p>
<p>⊙Oakland American female aviator Mrs. Putnam took off from here at 3:38 PM today, planning to fly around the world via the South Pacific. Mrs. Putnam was flying a Lockheed twin-engine monoplane. At the time of takeoff, it suddenly dropped sharply and almost fell into the cluster of cars near the airport. For a moment, tens of thousands of spectators held their breath and waited. However, it rose steadily not far from the ground and flew towards Honolulu. The weather was not good today, with rain all day long, so it was difficult to determine whether it could take off beforehand. However, it stopped slightly before departure, and the gentle wind blew slowly from the southwest, providing assistance during the ascent. Mrs. Putnam has one technician and two guides on board, carrying 900 gallons of oil. If this flight is successful, it will cover 27,000 miles, creating a record of circumnavigating the globe near the equator. After Mrs. Putnam arrives in Honolulu, she plans to go to Howland Island first, which is one of the stations in the Pacific established by the Commerce Department for the US-Australia air route. From there, she will reach Lae in New Guinea and then to Darwin, Australia. After Mrs. Putnam arrives in Australia, she plans to follow the Australia-England route to India, pass through the interior of Africa to Dakar, and then go to Brazil, north to Florida or Mexico, and return to Oakland. Mrs. Putnam's flight is not for speed, taking about three weeks. Its purpose is to study whether commercial flights around the world can be held, and there is no subsidy. All income is only the postage for the mail sent by philatelists. (National dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>⊙Oakland American famous female aviator, Ms. Earhart, or Mrs. Putnam, plans to make a feat of flying around the world, and recently departed from here, flying to the first destination, Honolulu. A few minutes before the departure, two commercial aircraft, one "Hawaii Clipper" and one "Pan American Clipper", flew westward via the same route. These three aircraft can have a competition in the Pacific. According to reports, Ms. Earhart has been preparing this flight plan for more than a day. It is from east to west, flying around the earth in a week, and trying to go along the equator. The lady once flew across the Atlantic in 1928, and the lady was the first American woman to fly across the Atlantic, so she has the reputation of "Female Lindbergh". (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Using Morocco as Bait to England and France</h3>
<p>Exchange Aid to Suppress Rebel Army; British and French Governments Decide to Reject</p>
<p>[London] It was learned today that the British and French had previously received a secret document from the Spanish government, requesting British and French aid to the Spanish government to suppress the rebel army, and promising special rights in Spanish Morocco as an exchange condition. After exchanging opinions, the British and French have decided to reject it. According to the opinion of diplomatic experts, this move by the Spanish government is a major diplomatic error and is harmful to the future of the Spanish government army and the rebel army's combat. As for the content of the Spanish proposal, it does not include the cession of land, but only the granting of a special military right, such as allowing British and French troops to pass through, or setting up naval and air force bases. British and French external experts have been ordered to draft a similar reply, stating the reasons for the rejection. (National dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Remains Cremated Today</h3>
<p>British House of Commons Holds Memorial Service; Baldwin and Others Deliver Eulogies</p>
<p>[London] Today, the British House of Commons held a memorial service to commemorate the late great statesman, Austen Chamberlain. Prime Minister Baldwin and others delivered moving eulogies in silence and solemnity. The seat of the former Foreign Secretary was empty, while his brother, Neville Chamberlain, silently sat behind the Speaker's chair, listening to the elegies. Baldwin said that when he first entered Parliament twenty-nine years ago, Austen had introduced him. Although there were differences in political views for a short time after that, their mutual respect never diminished. Baldwin also said that Austen's achievements during his tenure as Foreign Secretary were immortal, and that he was also a great parliamentary scholar whose eloquence was unparalleled in the world. His entire political career was extremely impressive, and his ability to abandon partisan prejudices and promote his frank and selfless spirit in his later years further proved the greatness of his personality. Then, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Attlee, stood up to speak, praising Austen for his efforts to mediate among the great politicians of Europe, hoping to eliminate various difficulties through friendly understanding. He also praised Austen's efforts in the Indian constitutional issue. Liberal Party Member of Parliament Sinclair, representing his party, called Austen a great member of the House of Commons who was able to adhere to his aspirations and beliefs, and whose words were frank and sincere, but forgiving to his political enemies, which was his special feature. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George, Austen's first friend in life, said that Austen's death was a blow to his heart, and that millions mourned him, because they were convinced that the leader who made them deeply admire democratic politics had passed away. In addition, members of various parties who paid tribute to the former Foreign Secretary included Independent Labour Party Member of Parliament Maxton, etc. Austen Chamberlain's remains will be cremated on the 19th and then buried in the St. Margaret's Cemetery in Westminster.

<h3>Important Resolution of the All-India Congress</h3>
<p>Continue to Oppose the Constitution</p>
<p>⊙New Delhi The All-India National Congress, which has been striving to oppose the Constitution in recent provincial assembly elections, resolved last night that provincial governors not exercising the special powers granted to them by the new Constitution is the only condition for party members to accept government office. This resolution was proposed by the Congress Working Committee and passed by a majority vote. Reuters News Agency learned from well-informed sources in London that the provincial governors of India are unwilling and unable to give Congress leaders any guarantees regarding the exercise of their special powers. If the Congress leaders insist on obtaining concrete guarantees regarding these special powers, it will be difficult to obtain them, and a complete deadlock will ensue. Mahatma Gandhi, who had not been involved in politics for a long time, joined the committee at the beginning of this week, and his compromise proposal was put forward, while Congress Chairman Nehru strongly opposed accepting office. With this new resolution, the Congress's front was maintained without breaking apart. However, it is still unclear whether a provincial government of the Congress faction can be organized, as both sides claim that the new resolution is a victory for their side. The opposition to accepting office believes that the guarantees required by the resolution will be difficult to obtain from the provincial governors, while supporters of accepting office believe that these guarantees are very vague and can be obtained. The Congress has a majority in six of the eleven provincial assemblies: Mumbai, Madras, Central Provinces, United Provinces, Bihar, and Orissa. The Congress is also the largest party in the assemblies of Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier. The Unity Party, which supports the Constitution, is organizing a government, and its leader, Sir Hayat Khan, is currently doing so. The new Constitution of India stipulates provincial autonomy and grants certain special powers to the provincial governors appointed by the British Emperor. The recent election was the first one held according to the new Constitution. The special powers of the provincial governors are roughly as follows: ㊀ The right to take any action deemed necessary to maintain peace and security, even if advised against by administrative officials; ㊁ Prevention of racial or other discrimination; ㊂ Prevention of discriminatory or punitive treatment of goods imported from the United Kingdom or Burma; ㊃ Protection of the rights of Indian states and protection of the rights and dignity of the rulers of each state.

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Passes Tax Increase Bill</h3>
<p>With Amended Clauses</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's general assembly of the House of Representatives opened at 2:39 PM, and the chamber was full due to the submission of the tax increase bill. First, the agenda was changed, and Chairman Masuda reported on the progress and results of the Provisional Tax Increase Law and four related bills in the committee, and explained that the three parties of the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Showakai jointly proposed three amendments and six supplementary resolutions, all of which had been approved. Next, the entire bill was taken as a topic for the second reading, which was immediately discussed.</p>
<h3>Increasing the Burden on the People</h3>
<p>Shakai's Chozo Mizutani first opposed in strong terms, launching a harsh attack on the Minister of Finance, saying:</p>
<p>This tax increase bill, whether indirect tax or direct tax, is still borne by the working masses. As for the huge military expenditure, it does nothing but impoverish the people. When should the expansion of national defense expenditure end? We are absolutely opposed to the tax increase that impoverishes the people. If you want to strengthen national defense, you should not increase the burden on the people, but should implement tax increases on capitalists or landowners. The so-called handshake between Finance Minister Yuki and the military is nothing but a handshake between the military and financial capitalists. This tax increase should still be historically denied by the oppressed class.</p>
<h3>Yuki's Consideration is Insufficient</h3>
<p>After Mizutani's speech, there was a great applause. Next, Morinaga Takahashi of the Minseito rose and said:</p>
<p>Although Finance Minister Yuki's financial policy is good, I feel that there is insufficient consideration for the political results. Therefore, from this point of view, we have proposed six supplementary resolutions, hoping to pay attention to correcting them.</p>
<p>Hajime Irei (Kokumin Domei) rose and said:</p>
<p>We express our opposition to the amendment to Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Tax Increase Law, and we support the other parts. He read out the items of the National League's hopes, and said that this tax increase plan is based on the capitalist class and does not listen to the calls of the general public and small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists.</p>
<p>Tsuguyo Miyazawa (Minseito) rose and said that the temporary profit tax was originally intended to correct the crippled economy of urban and rural areas, so it should be abolished immediately when it is fundamentally corrected.</p>
<h3>Disturbances by the Minor Faction</h3>
<p>Miyazawa then discussed the issues of local grant money, commodity prices, and the increase in national defense expenditure, and continued to speak without stopping. The chamber was quite tired of it, so the voice of "simple" rose frequently. At this point, Miyazawa made an inexplicable statement of support. At that time, Matsunaga moved to advocate stopping the discussion, which was decided because the majority of the Seiyukai and Minseito rose. But the minor faction suddenly caused a major disturbance. Kosaku Maeda (Second) jumped into the seat of the Minseito member and shouted loudly, and was escorted back to his original seat by the chamber guards. At this time, more than 30 members of the minor faction expressed their support and requested a roll-call vote on whether to stop the discussion. As a result of the vote, an absolute majority supported Matsunaga's proposal to stop the discussion, so the motion was passed.</p>
<h3>Final Vote Passed</h3>
<p>The Speaker proposed to vote by standing up for or against, and with the support of the Seiyukai, Minseito, Showakai and other factions, the amendment reported by the committee chairman was confirmed and approved. The meeting adjourned at 6:13 PM amid the clamor and angry shouts of the minor faction. (Domei dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>New York Mayor Insults Hitler, Hull Apologizes to German Ambassador</h3>
<p>States that the United States values freedom of speech, but festering resentment is not beneficial to both countries.</p>
<p>[Washington] The German Ambassador to the United States, Luther, protested again to the U.S. Department of State today because New York Mayor La Guardia made a speech at an anti-German rally, insulting German leader Hitler. Secretary of State Hull immediately replied, expressing his deep apologies again, and stating that the United States has always valued freedom of speech. It is futile to dwell on the past. He only hoped that the people of the United States and Germany would no longer participate in this type of increasingly bitter dispute, but would end it as soon as possible, change the subject, and engage in discussions in a civil manner, which would be beneficial to both countries.

Infantry, artillery, and cavalry advanced in succession, lasting 40 minutes before it was completed. The uniforms and steps of the troops were neat and lively. The cavalry's movements were particularly agile, and the horses were all the same color, which was greatly praised by the audience. The national army wore khaki uniforms. This was the fourth class, only trained for a month, but their spirit was also good. After the parade, the troops gathered separately and lined up in front of the platform to listen to the address. At 11:00 AM, Wang presented memorial medals to the wounded soldiers. The wounded soldiers took their places and stood solemnly in front of the platform, with three representatives receiving the medals on their behalf. After the presentation, the master of ceremonies reported on the deeds of Zhang Yangxian and Zhang Ziqing. Wang also presented memorial medals.

Fu Zuoyi presided over the meeting, with Wang and Yan standing on the left side of the platform, and Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengzhou, and Tang Enbo standing on the right side. After the ceremony was performed as usual, Fu delivered a welcome speech, briefly stating, "Today, Sui province has this opportunity to welcome Chairman Wang, a national hero, and Director Yan, who is responsible for the Jin-Sui region, in a united effort between Mongolia and Han, which is a great honor. Chairman Wang has endured great hardships and threats for the revolution before reaching today. We greatly admire his character and efforts. Director Yan has worked hard in the local area, especially in benefiting Jin-Sui. Last year, he presided over the War of Resistance and restored our confidence. Therefore, we should take the spirit of the two leaders as our spirit and the actions of the two leaders as our model, especially the Mongolian and Han nationalities in the border provinces, who can, under the leadership of the central government, make the relationship closer and the national defense more consolidated. Therefore, after the welcome rally, infinite hope is born." Next, Wang lectured on the central government's decision to unite sincerely and face national difficulties together, and the process of saving the country from extinction, and finally encouraged everyone with the words "China will achieve freedom and equality, otherwise, China will be the tomb of 400 million compatriots." Next, Yan gave a speech, saying that he would do his best to assist the development of Sui province, promote the sense of responsibility of civil servants, and be determined to preserve the integrity and safety of the land and people of Sui province. When Wang and Yan spoke, the audience stood up every time the Premier, Chairman Lin, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Chairman Wang, and Director Yan were mentioned to pay respect. Wang spoke a total of 14 times, and Wang and Yan bowed to thank the audience each time they paid respect. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet</p>

The Sparrow Mansion Orchestra played music in the hall. Mongolian lords, local gentry, and Catholic priests were also invited, totaling more than one hundred people. Wang and Yan arrived around 7:00 PM. During the banquet, Fu first delivered a speech, briefly stating, "Distinguished leaders and guests, this time Suiyuan held a memorial service for the soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, and you came from afar, which is a great honor for the deceased and an encouragement for the living. Everything has not only been inadequate, but you have also been inconvenienced for a few days. In addition to gratitude, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you good health with vegetarian dishes and light wine." Next, Wang stood up and replied, saying, "Chairman Fu, distinguished leaders, fellow compatriots, you are shouldering heavy responsibilities in Suiyuan, the front line of national defense, and I greatly admire you. This time, I participated in the memorial service yesterday and the military parade today. Everything shows the spirit of military-civilian cooperation. I feel that the future is infinitely bright. In your busy schedules, you did not forget to entertain us, which shows your meticulousness in handling affairs. In addition to gratitude, I would like to borrow the host's wine to wish you all good health." From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves in the midst of melodious music and dispersed. (17th)</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Merchants Request Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The tax bureau's newly determined tax amount for merchants is four to five times higher than the merchants' own assessment.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: The Fujian Department of Finance believes that the general business tax in this province is paid by merchants of various guilds based on their own assessments. This is not very accurate as the standard for taxation is based on business volume and capital. A special tax investigation was launched, starting with the provincial capital. The Provincial Capital Tax Special Investigation Office was organized in conjunction with the Provincial Capital Tax Bureau. A large number of investigators were dispatched to shops throughout the city to review accounts and investigate capital and business conditions, and re-determined the tax amount to be paid. Notices were sent to the shops to comply. If the shops believe that the newly determined tax amount is not very accurate, they can submit their accounts to the tax bureau within three days to request correction. However, the tax bureau notices received by the shops recently have been two to three times higher, or even four to five times higher, than the old amount. For example, the gold and silverware industry used to pay 1,560 yuan per year for the entire guild, but now they have to pay more than 30,000 yuan. Those who used to pay ten yuan per month now have to pay more than 390 yuan, which is really unbearable. Trade associations of various industries have been holding meetings for days to discuss how to deal with the situation. Many have sent the notices to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that they be returned to the tax bureau on their behalf, expressing that they cannot recognize them and demanding a re-evaluation. The situation is quite tense. The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce convened a special meeting on the previous day (15th). After representatives of various industries reported on the situation, it was resolved to request the authorities to comply with Article 4 of the "General Guidelines for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces" stipulated by the Ministry, which should not exceed 5/1000 at most, and to abolish all harsh and miscellaneous taxes. The standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Meihui, led more than 30 representatives of various industries to the tax bureau and the Department of Finance to petition, stating their difficulties. Furthermore, with the income tax about to be levied, merchants would be unable to bear the burden if the business tax were to be further increased. It was appropriate that the Director of the Department of Finance, Si Lie, was on leave due to illness, and no results were obtained. On the 16th, the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating that the Fujian Department of Finance's reorganization of the business tax this time, promulgating the revised articles of March 1936, has been increased in intensity. At a time when various harsh taxes have not been abolished, the suffering of merchants is already deep, and it is really difficult to bear the burden. Recently, the Provincial Capital Tax Bureau has been distributing tax notices that exceed the articles stipulated by the Ministry by many times. If this is not resolved and improved, all merchants will inevitably go bankrupt. Now, the merchants are in a state of panic and vow not to recognize them. They implore that Chairman Chen be ordered to order the Fujian Department of Finance to collect taxes in accordance with the Ministry's regulations in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties, etc. At the same time, they also telegraphed the fellow-provincial associations in Beijing and Shanghai, requesting them to appeal to Chen Yi, the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government staying in Shanghai, to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and quickly order the taxes to be collected as before. (March 17th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Kailuan Mining Company Robbed</p>
<p>The Kailuan Coal Mine branch company near the train station outside Pingmen was robbed by four bandits at 7:00 PM on the 17th. The company's tea boy climbed over the back wall to report to the station's military police. Military Police Company Commander Deng immediately dispatched seven military policemen to pursue and apprehend them. However, upon reaching the destination, the bandits were just breaking out of the struggle. Seeing the military police arrive, they immediately opened fire and swept the area. Military Policeman Wu Peng was immediately killed by a bullet. Military Policeman Shi Youmin was seriously injured in the lower abdomen by a bullet and was sent to the hospital for treatment. One bandit, Bao Xin, was captured on the spot and sent to the regimental headquarters for interrogation that night. After this case occurred, people in Suzhou were impressed by the brave sacrifice of the military police, which is commendable and encourages future generations. A memorial service is planned in the coming days, and it is planned to bury the deceased military policeman in Suzhou and erect a monument to commemorate him.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Discussion on Land Price Estimation</p>
<p>After handling the urban land price declaration, the Wuxi Land Administration Bureau is currently handling land registration. The Provincial Land Administration Bureau specially sent specialist Ma Yulin to Wuxi last month to estimate land prices. After arriving in Wuxi, Ma went to various places inside and outside the city to inspect and convened town leaders in the urban area for talks. He then used the prosperity and decline of the commercial districts as the standard for the height of land prices. As a result, the highest estimate was more than 15,000 yuan per mu, and the lowest was more than 1,000 yuan. After the land price estimation committee has discussed it once, it will be submitted to the province to prepare for the levy of taxes. The Wuxi Shanghai Fellow-Provincial Association believes that according to Article 6 of the "Rules for the Collection of Land Price Tax in Various Counties and Cities Revised in Jiangsu Province," regarding the regulations on land price tax rates, if the land price is high, the estimated price is already high and the tax is heavy. If the land price is low, the tax rate is high and the tax is even heavier. Compared to the original land price tax of 9 jiao and 6 fen and 6 li per mu, it has suddenly increased to 100 times or more than 60 times. The financial capacity of the people is limited. How can they bear the burden? Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, urging them to pay special attention to this comprehensive tax rate reform. After receiving the telegram, the Chamber of Commerce forwarded it to local public legal groups and scheduled a meeting of local gentry on the afternoon of the 20th of this month to discuss it.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Ordering of Spring Silkworm Seeds</p>
<p>This spring silkworm season, due to the good harvest last year and the revival of the rural economy, and the recent rise in silk prices, farmers have shown an exceptionally strong interest in silkworm rearing and are ordering silkworm seeds in large numbers. According to statistics from the Silkworm Model Zone, approximately 3,000 sheets are ordered per day. In the past half month, including previous reservations, a total of more than 10,000 sheets have been ordered. The sales volume this year is expected to break all previous records. In addition to sending personnel to the countryside to provide guidance, the zone also conducts training classes for silkworm farmers. Technology Director Zhou Dao also went to the Qianzhou Town area of the 9th district on the morning of the 17th to provide guidance and promote all work. It is also reported that the province has issued 10,000 mulberry seedlings for planting in this county, which will be received by the Qianqiao Silkworm Experiment Field and allocated to the Anzhen Cooperative for planting.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Meningitis Found in the City</p>
<p>The weather was not very cold last winter, and the climate has not returned to normal in the spring. As a result, epidemics have occurred in Xicheng and other counties, and the epidemic has now spread to this county. A woman surnamed Mou suddenly died outside the South Gate the other day. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was meningitis. It is spreading extremely quickly. There have already been several deaths near the Southeast Gate that were rumored to be caused by infection. Furthermore, according to general speculation, because the main road in the first urban expansion area is currently being widened, the ditches along the road are being excavated. The accumulated filth in the ditches evaporates after being exposed to the sun, causing this epidemic. The authorities are taking measures to prevent it.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Robbery Occurs on Bo'ai Road</p>
<p>Zhou Mouliang, a resident of the middle section of Bo'ai Road outside Wu Yi Bo'ai Gate, is currently employed by Sassoon &amp; Co. in Shanghai, leaving only his wife, Zhou Liangjin, at home to take care of the house, and renting the remaining rooms to Zuo Qingying. At around 1:00 AM on the 17th, six or seven bandits suddenly entered by digging a hole in the back wall. They tied up Zhou Liangjin and looted at will, leaving nothing of value. Zuo Qingying, who lived with her, was also affected. After about two hours, they left through the front door with their loot. Upon inspection after the incident, the total loss for both families was six to seven hundred yuan. By the time the police were notified to investigate, the bandits had already fled far away.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Large Sum of Money Robbed from Qianzhuang</p>
<p>Dacheng Qianzhuang, located at the intersection of Tianzhu Street and Dongwu Street in Zhenjiang, was opened by Guo Yuzhang, a local. It has been in operation for 17 years. The business was quite prosperous at first, but the business has gradually declined due to the market. However, at around 8:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, just as the partners were opening the door for business, four bandits suddenly arrived. One person was outside acting as a lookout. The other three, wearing blue robes, two holding box guns and one holding a Browning, speaking in a Shanxi accent, one in a Zhejiang accent, and carrying a bamboo basket, rushed in and ordered everyone in the qianzhuang to be quiet and drove them into a small room in the back. Then, the bandit with the Shanxi accent demanded the key to the silver box from Feng Xiangren, the teller of the qianzhuang. Seeing the bandit pointing a gun at him, Feng did not dare to refuse and handed over the key. The bandits opened the silver box and completely robbed more than 3,900 yuan in jiao notes stored in the box, storing them in the bamboo basket. They called the lookout and left through the door. The owner of the qianzhuang then reported the incident to the police. The police chief personally came to investigate and ordered a strict arrest.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Catties of Stored Grain Stolen</p>
<p>In the Jiqing Township of Yin County, there is a township granary built within the township office, storing grain accumulated over the years, amounting to a considerable quantity. The township clerk, who usually resided there, recently took leave to go to Ningbo due to his wife giving birth there. As a result, the premises were unoccupied at night. On the night of the fourteenth, a large group of thieves scaled the wall and entered, prying open the lock of the township office door, as well as the granary boards on both the left and right sides. They stole over 16,000 catties of stored grain from the two granaries on the right. The door of the left granary was also pried open, but the grain was not stolen. This incident was discovered in the morning by a passerby, who reported it to the township head. A deputy was dispatched by the county to investigate, but no leads have been found yet.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Statistics on Education Expenditures of Various Provinces and Cities Across the Country for the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently compiled statistics comparing the education expenditures of various provinces and cities across the country for the 23rd year. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Central Education and Culture Expenditures: In the 23rd year, the central education and culture expenditures amounted to 33,819,365 yuan, education subsidies amounted to 9,229,172 yuan, and the expenditures on education organized by other central ministries and commissions amounted to 2,793,260 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Education Expenditures of Various Provinces and Cities: In the 23rd year, the “revenue” for education expenditures in various provinces and cities totaled 36,856,444 yuan, and the “expenditures” totaled 36,971,544 yuan. Among these, 5,463,882 yuan was “allocated” to primary education, 16,995,117 yuan to secondary education, 7,159,072 yuan to higher education, 2,358,686 yuan to social education, 3,066,484 yuan to various project expenses and subsidies, and 1,928,303 yuan to educational administration.

The “allocation of higher education expenditures” in various provinces and cities was 904,558 yuan for specialized schools, 4,471,610 yuan for universities or independent colleges, 129,928 yuan for other academic institutions, and 1,652,976 yuan for overseas studies. The “allocation of secondary education expenditures” was 6,548,497 yuan for junior middle schools, 2,018,892 yuan for senior middle schools, 4,048,657 yuan for normal schools, 931,599 yuan for short-term normal courses, 2,267,603 yuan for junior vocational schools, and 1,179,886 yuan for senior vocational schools. The “allocation of primary education expenditures” was 360,349 yuan for kindergartens, 3,591,274 yuan for junior primary schools, and 1,512,259 yuan for senior primary schools. The “allocation of social education expenditures” was 70,786 yuan for social education talent training institutions, 1,847,776 yuan for general social education institutions, 317,849 yuan for school-style social education institutions, and 122,275 yuan for other professional fees and subsidies. The average expenditure on education per person was 13 cents.</p>
<p>(Explanation) ㊀ In the 22nd and 23rd years, the provinces with education expenditures exceeding 4 million yuan were Jiangsu and Guangdong. Provinces exceeding 3 million yuan were Hebei and Shandong. Provinces exceeding 2 million yuan were Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Guangxi, and Henan. Provinces and cities exceeding 1 million yuan were Shanxi, Peiping, and Beijing. Qingdao's expenditures were approximately 7-800,000 yuan. Guizhou and Suiyuan provinces each had approximately 3-400,000 yuan. Weihaiwei had over 100,000 yuan, and Qinghai had only over 99,000 yuan. As for the percentage of education expenditures to the total estimated expenditures of each province and city, the urban area with the highest percentage was Weihaiwei, with 29% in the 22nd year and 43% in the 23rd year. Nanjing had the lowest percentage in the 22nd year, at 8%. Among the provinces and cities, Anhui ranked first with 24%, followed by Jiangsu, Suiyuan, Henan, Guangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Jiangxi, etc., all between 10% and 20%. The rest were all below 10%, with Qinghai having the lowest, at approximately 5%.</p>
<p>㊁ Among the provinces, counties, and cities, Jiangsu had the highest education expenditures, approximately 10 million yuan, followed by Shandong and Henan, at approximately 4-5 million yuan. Suiyuan had the lowest, at over 200,000 yuan. Regarding the percentage of education expenditures to the total expenditures, Chahar had an exceptionally high percentage, estimated at over 60%. Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu all accounted for approximately 30-40%. Suiyuan accounted for 27-28%, and Jiangxi, which was only 16% in the 22nd year, increased to 24% in the 23rd year. According to the draft constitution announced by the National Government, the minimum central education expenditure should be 15% of the total budget (only 4.68% in the 23rd year), and the provinces, regions, counties, and cities should be 30%. It seems that the difference between the provinces, regions and the actual is still large, and the central government needs to increase it urgently. ㊂ The sources of education expenditures in various provinces and cities mostly come from the unified revenue and expenditure of provincial and municipal treasuries. The only ones with designated education funds are Jiangsu's land tax and slaughter and brokerage taxes, which can generate over 4 million yuan annually; Zhejiang's packaging and business tax and tobacco and alcohol surcharges (although still paid by the provincial treasury irregularly); Jiangxi's annual allocation of 2 million yuan from the salt tax fund; Guizhou's annual slaughter tax revenue of over 300,000 yuan; and Henan's annual deed tax revenue of over 2 million yuan. Other provinces and cities are all under the unified planning and allocation of the provincial treasury, or rely on central government subsidies.</p>
<p>㊃ In the county and city parts, except for Guangxi, which is unified revenue and expenditure by the county government, most other provinces rely on land tax revenue as the main source. Henan Province has a significant amount of deed tax and miscellaneous donations, and Fujian Province also has a large income from education surcharges. The expenses for village schools in Shandong and Chahar provinces are raised locally, accounting for a considerable amount.</p>
<p>㊄ The average percentage of the entire education expenditure is highest for secondary education, accounting for 40-50%. Higher education accounts for 19%, primary education accounts for 13-14%, social education accounts for 6.38%, project and reserve funds account for 8%, and educational administration accounts for the lowest, at 5%. In the county and city parts, primary education accounts for the highest, at 65%, secondary education accounts for around 10%, social education accounts for 8-9%, project expenses decreased to 9% in the 23rd year, and educational administration accounts for between 7 and 8%.</p>
<p>㊅ On average, the higher education expenditures of various provinces and cities are mostly spent on universities and independent colleges (62.46%), followed by overseas studies (23.09%), specialized schools account for about 12-13%, and other academic institutions account for only about 1%. Secondary education expenditures are mostly spent on senior high schools, accounting for over 50%, normal schools account for about 30%, and vocational schools account for 20%, which is far from the Ministry's standard of 35%. In primary education expenditures, junior primary schools account for 65-66%, senior primary schools account for 28-29%, and kindergartens account for 5-6%. In social education expenditures, general social education institutions account for the most, at over 70%, followed by social education talent training institutions, and then school-style social education institutions, with other professional subsidies accounting for the least, at about 4-5%. ㊆ Secondary education expenditures in various provinces, counties, and cities are still mostly spent on junior and senior high schools, accounting for 50%, normal schools account for 40%, and vocational schools only get 10%. Primary education expenditures are spent mostly on junior primary schools, accounting for about 70%, senior primary schools account for about 30%, and kindergartens are very few, less than 1%. Social education expenditures are also spent mostly on general social education institutions, accounting for 78-79%, school-style social education institutions account for 20%, and social education personnel training institutions are just over 1%.</p>
<p>㊇ Guangdong Province had the largest increase in education expenditures compared to the 22nd year, with an increase of about 22%, and Xikang increased by about +11%. Among the cities, Nanjing had a sharp increase of 76%, and Weihaiwei increased by 32%, which were the most significant. Other provinces and cities also had increases to varying degrees, but Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi had reductions. In the county and city parts, Shandong and Jiangxi both increased by 25%, Guangxi increased by 18%, and Suiyuan increased by 2%. Henan decreased by 1%, Chahar decreased by 6%, and Jiangsu decreased sharply by 17%.</p>
<p>㊈ Regarding the average expenditure on education at all levels per person, the cities bear a heavier burden. Beijing is 2 yuan 35 cents, Qingdao is also close to 2 yuan, and Beiping and Weihaiwei are both between 7 and 8 jiao. Among the provinces, Guangxi bears 2 jiao, which is relatively high. Most provinces are several cents of 1 jiao, with Guizhou having the lowest, at only 6 fen. In the county and city parts, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Chahar each bear more than 2 jiao, while Shandong, Hebei, and Suiyuan bear about 1 jiao 4-5 fen. The overall average for all provinces and cities is 1 jiao 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Leningrad Children's Palace</h3>

<h3>Diagnostic Test of Engineering Ability of Zhongda Students</h3>
<p>Conducted by the Educational Experiment Institute of Zhongda</p>
<p>In recent years, China's construction industry has become increasingly developed, and there is an urgent need for engineering talents. Young people with aspirations flock to it. Dr. Xiao Xiaorong, professor guiding the Educational Experiment Institute of the College of Education of Zhongda, noted that most high school students in our country strive to enter the engineering departments of universities, but many are eliminated either because they do not meet the physical and intellectual requirements, or during the entrance examination, or they change their majors midway after entering the university, or they have difficulty achieving success after graduation, which has a profound impact on vocational education. Therefore, he developed several engineering ability diagnostic tests to determine whether high school seniors and university freshmen have the qualifications to receive engineering education, so as to avoid wasting time, energy, and money. It is reported that he is now guiding graduate student Wu Jianglin to carry out this work. In addition to testing in major middle schools in Nanjing, Wu will also go to Shanghai and Hangzhou on the 14th of this month to conduct tests. It is expected that about 1,000 university engineering students and middle school students can be tested.</p>

<h3>National Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>More Valuable Exhibits Arrive</p>
<p>The preparatory committee for the National Art Exhibition has recently received 8-9,000 exhibits sent by various parties. The National Peiping Library has also sent dozens of valuable exhibits from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, as well as manuscripts and ancient books by famous people, and ten kinds of Dunhuang manuscripts, including copies by famous people from the Jin, Wei, and Tang dynasties, which are rarely seen outside. At that time, people will be able to feast their eyes on them. Chen Danian, a collector from Guangdong, has over 1,000 kinds of ancient jade. In addition, Wen Youju painted a hand scroll of the scenery along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, one foot high and 530 feet long. Introduced by the Guangdong Education Department, he is willing to send it to the exhibition. However, he stated that the exhibition should prepare 40 large eight-immortal tables for display. The preparatory committee believed that the hand scroll required 40 large eight-immortal tables to be displayed, which would occupy one-third of the entire area of the venue. Due to the limitations of the site, it was really impossible to receive and display it. It has replied with a letter expressing regret.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The organizing committee of the National Art Exhibition has decided to form an editorial committee and has hired 20 experts as members, with Teng Gu as the director. Their task is to write papers, disseminate knowledge related to the exhibits, guide criticism, and enhance social artistic taste. The association has also decided that the price of each admission ticket is 2 jiao, and half price for military, police, and students.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Actively Promoting Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>▲Adding Short-Term Primary Schools and Expanding Enrollment This Semester</p>
<p>▲Ordering Compulsory Enrollment Measures, Violators to Be Punished</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Compulsory Education Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has been actively promoting compulsory education with all its might. The committee held its ninth regular meeting the other day, passed the implementation of the Compulsory Enrollment Law and various plans, and Xue Wei, an official of the bureau, broadcast a report on the current situation of compulsory education on the municipal radio station yesterday afternoon at 4:30. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Adding Short-Term Primary Schools This semester, a total of 19 short-term primary schools, 1 ordinary primary school, 1 two-part grade, and 2 mobile education classes will be added. In total, 44 short-term primary schools with 104 classes were established in the 25th year, accommodating 5,720 students. There were 107 short-term primary school classes in the first semester and 91 classes in the second semester, accommodating 5,885 students. In the first semester, 5 ordinary primary schools (1 two-part grade) were added, and 1 school was added in the first semester. A total of 58 grades were added in the first semester and 11 grades in the first semester, accommodating a total of 3,500 students. Two-part systems total 30 grades, accommodating 3,000 students. There are 5 mobile education classes, accommodating 275 students. This year, a total of 18,380 students were enrolled. In order to increase the effectiveness of teaching, the Social Affairs Bureau also provided short-term training to all principals, teachers, and teaching assistants during the winter vacation, and they have now been assigned to work.</p>
<p>▲School-Age Children in the City The Social Affairs Bureau's survey of school-age children in the city has now been completed (excluding the special zone). A total of 53,763 school-age children in the city have been enrolled, 36,630 have not been enrolled, 606 have deferred enrollment, and 281 are exempt, totaling 108,115. Among them, the Yuejie Building Road has not been surveyed, and the primary school district of Zhongbishi Primary School in Yinhang District, Lukge Primary School, has not been surveyed. In total, since most of the students enrolled are over 12 years old and under 6 years old, and there are many students coming from the Kunlian Concession and various counties in Kunlian and Zou provinces, the number of children in the city is only over 108,000, which does not seem correct.

<h3>Chinese Basketball Team Going to Beijing This Morning</h3>
<p>Two Games Against Central Military Academy Tomorrow and the Day After</p>
<p>The Chinese basketball team, which gathers the essence of Shanghai, failed to win the international championship this year, but its talents and skills are indeed superior to those of the past few years. For example, in the final battle against the United States, it had a 38-minute advantage. Although the final victory was still won by the Americans, the beauty of the performance at that time was truly worthy of praise. In order to observe the skills, a group of thirteen people took a fast train to Beijing at 8:30 this morning to play two friendly matches with the Central Military Academy basketball team, which dominates the capital. The order is as follows: ㊀ Chinese vs. Military Academy: 4:00 pm on the 20th at the Amateur Court. ㊁ Chinese vs. Military Academy: 3:00 pm on the 21st at the Amateur Court. The full team list is as follows: Coach: Li Xianjun, Manager: Shen Kunnan, Players: Wang Nanzhen (Captain), Feng Nianhua, Chen Xianglong, Kuang Yaoya, Zhou Dayun, Cai Yanxiong, Yin Guiren, Weng Renan, Chen Zongqi, Han Zhenyuan, Li Zude.</p>
<h3>Austrian Defeat Boosts South China's Hopes</h3>
<p>Li Huitang Scores a Hat-Trick, Defeating Wireless; Bao Jiaping's Goalkeeping Also Crucial</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) On Sunday the 14th, in the First Division of the Ordinary Cup Football Tournament, South China, relying on Li Huitang's three goals, surprisingly defeated the strong Wireless team by three goals, overcoming this difficult hurdle. The day before, Western defeated Austrian 4-2, greatly assisting South China. Thus, South China's record is equal to Austrian's, with only one game less. From now on, the future is bright, and there are no more obstacles in the remaining games. It seems the dream of winning three consecutive championships will definitely be realized. The current situation of the top four teams is listed below:</p>
<p>The number of spectators that day was particularly large. The stands in So Kon Po were full. Both sides regarded the match as facing a strong enemy and spared no effort. Tan Jiangbai of South China was absent, but Ye Beihua, who had been absent for a long time, suddenly reappeared as left winger. Zheng Jiliang retreated to fill the left back position. Weighing the strength of the teams, South China was indeed a step ahead. After the start of the match, the difference was immediately apparent. Li Huitang's shooting skills greatly intimidated the opponents. As expected, within twelve minutes, he scored the first goal. Wireless then got a penalty kick, but it was blocked by Bao Jiaping. The first half ended with a score of 1-0. In the second half, Wireless was not in good shape, and their left centre-back, Taylor, was injured and had to leave the field, leaving them with only ten players. They were constantly at a disadvantage. Li Huitang scored two more goals, winning 3-0. Old Bao of South China was cautious and prudent. Zheng Jiliang played left back, partnering with Li Tiansheng, and surprisingly performed well, defending properly. The three centre-backs were a cohesive unit. The forwards Cao, Li, Ye were mediocre, while Li and Feng were the most outstanding. Li used all his skills, dribbling, passing, and shooting, which was amazing. Wireless's formation was chaotic, their coordination scattered. Their attack was brave but lacked strategy, and their defense was indecisive in critical moments. Their defeat was therefore justified.</p>
<p>Li Huitang, National Player, Breaks the Enemy's Defense</p>
<p>Referee Mr. Li Lu blew the whistle to start the match. South China took the offensive first. Li Huitang was elusive, launching rapid attacks. Lawrence welcomed the attack. Soon, South China attacked again. Wan Lian committed a foul. Li Huitang took the free kick, shooting directly at the goal, but Lawrence caught it again. Wireless attacked twice, but to no avail. Li and Feng of South China, assisting each other, gradually pressed towards the enemy's goal, but did not succeed. Wireless switched from defense to attack. Zheng Jiliang bravely blocked Bailey outside the penalty area and was penalized. Evans lofted the ball towards the goal, but Jiaping caught it skillfully. Soon, Sullivan returned, passing the ball to Roberts for a deep shot, but it hit the post and went out of bounds. After twelve minutes of the match, South China was already in good form. Huang Meishun passed the ball from the center, and Li and Feng passed it on briefly. Huitang dribbled and advanced, shooting quickly, opening the scoring. There was a round of applause.</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Iron Hands Guard the City</p>
<p>Having conceded a goal, Wireless quickly tried to retaliate. After the restart in the center, within a few rounds, Torbett dribbled and advanced, passing diagonally to the left. Roberts moved forward to receive the pass, returning the ball to the penalty area along the baseline, hitting Meishun's hand. A penalty kick was awarded. Sullivan's kick was not strong, and Jiaping caught it with iron hands, saving the day. The forwards then attacked again. Li and Cao cooperated, forcing a corner kick. Taylor took it, and Jiliang returned it to the original spot. Huitang received the ball and took a long shot, the ball flying like an arrow, but unfortunately, it went wide. Wireless counterattacked, Sullivan shot from close range, and Taylor lobbed from afar, but both were collected by Jiaping. Torbett then charged up, passing to Sullivan for a diagonal shot from close range. Jiaping dived and saved the danger. The enemy soldiers were unwilling to give up. Evans intercepted the ball and passed it to Bailey for a cross. Lawrence responded from the left, shaking his head and heading fiercely, but it went over the bar. The half ended.</p>
<p>Wireless Loses Soldiers and Generals</p>
<p>Changing ends for the second half, the situation was no longer as tense as before. Wan Lian passed the ball to Torbett, who fired a long-range shot, but it went wide. Suddenly, Taylor, due to a collision with Li Zhaorong, fell and injured his hand, leaving the field. From then on, they fought with only ten players. South China often dominated the field. Liang Rongzhao lobbed the ball high, Lawrence caught it and passed it out, Meishun intercepted and sent it forward, Jingxiang slashed diagonally, and Beihua advanced quickly. Evans was forced to concede a corner kick, desperately trying to break out. Beihua was then injured in a brave battle and retired for a short rest. Both sides fought with ten players. Cao Guicheng penetrated the enemy's formation, and Jie Ting forced a corner kick. After Guicheng kicked it out, Bailey countered, passing a dangerous ball, but Rongzhao managed to break through the encirclement. Hui constantly moved back and forth in the enemy's formation. Guicheng forced a corner kick. Evans, outside the back line, did not guard his hand, and Huitang took the free kick, shooting straight at the goal, but it was again caught by Lawrence.</p>
<p>South China Returns Home in Glory</p>
<p>At this time, Beihua returned to the field. Wireless was gradually feeling unsustainable. In the 21st minute, Liang Rongzhao advanced from the back, passing the ball forward. The three forwards passed it five times, breaking through the defense and entering the area. Jie Ting touched the ball with his hand, which was seen by everyone, but was not penalized. Huitang's ambition was aroused, dribbling and passing through the crowd, firing a sharp shot. Clearly and precisely, the ball entered the goal, making it 2-0. Wireless struggled once, forcing a corner kick, but to no avail. Guicheng, who had been waiting for a long time, passed a wonderful ball from the center. Lawrence hit and kicked it, temporarily relieving the pressure. In the 28th minute, Li Tiansheng encountered the enemy, sending the ball forward with a big kick. Cao Guicheng dodged Jie Ting, passing it diagonally along the side to Huitang, who flew forward, Wilmer chasing hard but unable to catch up. Li shot from close range, scoring another great achievement, making it a clean score of 3-0. Wireless had no fighting spirit and could not score a goal. Soon, the match ended.</p>

<h3>Chinese Team to Play Portugal in International Cup Semi-Finals Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ 2:30 PM at Yat Yuen Stadium</p>
<p>This week's football highlight is the International Cup semi-final between China and Portugal on Saturday. This year, domestic teams have achieved very little. The issue of Tung Wah and Loyola's withdrawal from the Scott Cup has not yet been resolved, and the Chinese team has no hope in the First Division. Therefore, this International Cup match must be played with effort in order to win some glory for the Chinese. In addition, there will be two First Division matches: Kiang Nan vs. Lux and Westerners vs. French Merchants. The situation will likely be one-sided, with Lux and French Merchants undoubtedly winning. On Sunday, the most anticipated league match is between Chen Tan and Tsin Tak, with victory likely going to Tsin Tak. Another match will be between French Merchants and Sociedade. Although the French Merchants will be fighting for two days, they should have no problem against the weak Sociedade. The order of matches for the two days is listed as follows:</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Following the Lead of the Financial Sector</p>
<p>Public Bonds Surge to Prominence</p>
<p>Rising by $1 to $1.35</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly saw a special surge in the afternoon. All public bonds except Class A reached new highs. After brewing for several weeks, good news appeared and prices rose. As the March term was approaching, this triggered short covering, which further boosted the market. As the reporter predicted, the surge was particularly strong because yarn merchants and gold merchants followed the financial sector and bought in large quantities. The market suddenly became prosperous, and confidence soared. The trend is expected to continue. Yesterday, the market opened with mixed results, with fluctuations of only five cents. The stagnation in the second session was unprecedented. Although various public bonds were opened in turn, none of them, except for the current month's bonds, which were slightly down by five cents, showed any fluctuations. In the afternoon, numbers 10, 14, 34, and 77 suddenly saw buying, which quickly changed market sentiment and prices rose slowly. Class B forward bonds suddenly rose by as much as 65 cents, and the market became lively. At the close, numbers 10 and 35 continued to see buying, which again triggered short covering. Class D soared by $1.15, and the rest also rose by several cents to about $1. The result was that the current month's Class E rose by 65 cents, and the current month's Class A rose by 80 cents, the least. The rest all rose by $1 to $1.35. The total transaction volume was $8.33 million. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn</h3>
<p>Sichuan Sales Surge Again, Yarn Prices Soar</p>
<p>Shorts Suffer and Cover at a Loss</p>
<p>Market Advances Steadily</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend intensified. This was because spring sales developed, and merchants rushed to purchase. Sichuan merchants bought even more aggressively, and Tianjin, inland, and Changsha merchants also searched for supplies. At the same time, the atmosphere of good news was strong, shaking confidence. Shorts, seeing the unfavorable environment, had to cover at a loss, and the market advanced steadily. All months broke through the $240 mark, reaching new peaks in recent times.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rises by $3.8</p>
<p>In the opening session of the standard yarn market, all months saw slight increases, but US cotton and grade three cotton both fell. However, local sentiment turned firm and bullish, and shorts took the opportunity to cover when foreign cotton fell slightly. As a result, the market rebounded from weakness, and each month jumped by $1.78 to $2. The forward months all broke through the $40 mark. By the close, it was reported that spot yarn transactions were less than before, with 1,300 bales sold, and prices rose by $1-2. The close was slightly lower. The result of the standard yarn was that each month rose by $1.7-9 to $2.1 compared to the previous day's close. The market was even stronger in the afternoon session. Due to good news about spot yarn, shorts rushed to cover, and the market became tighter. The forward months rose even more strongly. By the close, there was a further advance. It was reported that the spot yarn business was more than 4,000 bales. The results of the standard yarn were that each month rose by another $1.3, 4, and 5 compared to the morning session's close. It was found that 1,000 bales of Jifeng, 1,750 bales of Mingde, 8,050 bales of Gengfeng, 1,050 bales of Changyu, 1,350 bales of Shenji, 1,000 bales of Renfeng, 2,000 bales of Yicheng, 4,400 bales of Changfeng, 2,950 bales of Xiecheng, 1,400 bales of Hengchang, 1,100 bales of Changji, 1,100 bales of Ruid, 1,050 bales of Wang Taixing, 3,950 bales of Taichang, 1,250 bales of Dachang, and 1,400 bales of Tonghe were sold. 3,450 bales of Dafu, 2,550 bales of Hengyi, 2,550 bales of Jinchang, 1,750 bales of Zhenda, 4,600 bales of Hexing, 1,700 bales of Tongfeng, 2,800 bales of Fengtai, 3,900 bales of Dachangcheng, 4,450 bales of Dachang, 5,100 bales of Yuda, and 1,550 bales of Runkang were bought. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Exceed 4,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remained active. Statistics show that merchants bought a total of 4,269 bales throughout the day. The selling prices were: yuan/bale, yuan/bale. The amount of purchases by each merchant is listed below.</p>
<p>Han Cotton Can Be Delivered, Cotton Prices Not as High as Yarn Prices</p>
<p>The cotton market continued to rise and the momentum was strong. This was because US cotton had been soaring for days, and Shanghai market had not yet risen enough. Yesterday, US cotton slightly retraced, and general speculators took the opportunity to cover, resulting in a dry market and a rebound in prices. However, according to some, this month's Shashi cotton and Hankou cotton can both be delivered, so the market slightly retreated at the afternoon close.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Sees Both Short Covering and Profit Taking</p>
<p>In the opening session of the standard cotton market, all months saw increases, but US cotton fell while Indian cotton continued to rise. Shorts took advantage of the US cotton decline to cover, resulting in a tighter market. At the same time, the yarn market advanced, making the market even stronger, rising step by step. The result of the standard cotton was that each month rose by 3, 4, and 5 cents compared to the previous day's close. The market remained firm in the afternoon session, following the yarn market, but the momentum was not as strong as the yarn market. This was because profit-takers sold out, and the forward months had already risen above the $6 mark. The result of the standard cotton was that each month fell by 5 cents to 1.5 cents compared to the morning session's close. It was found that 4,200 dan of Jifeng, 4,200 dan of Dafeng, 5,500 dan of Changji, 3,300 dan of Shenchang, 14,300 dan of Taichang, 5,500 dan of Yichang, 3,400 dan of Runkang, 10,400 dan of Dachang, 6,300 dan of Shengyuan, 6,300 dan of Xinchang, 2,800 dan of Yuan, and 2,100 dan of Fukang were sold. 7,400 dan of Hengyi, 2,600 dan of Dafu, 8,800 dan of Yuda, 11,700 dan of Jinchang, 4,400 dan of Zhenda, 3,000 dan of Ruid, 3,400 dan of Senkang, 3,100 dan of Tongfeng, 7,000 dan of Dachangcheng, 3,300 dan of Xincheng, 4,400 dan of Wang Taixing, and 2,100 dan of Yuanxingchang were bought. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Increasingly Interested in Importing Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still decent, and Japanese factories are buying more actively. There are no reports of sources.</p>
<p>US Cotton Sees Large-Scale Profit Taking</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with mixed results. Each month varied from a drop of 3 points to a rise of 4 points. In the early morning, industry peers, Wall Street, and foreign merchants bought in. The forward months were particularly firm due to strong cloth sales. As the March term was ending today, long positions were closed out, resulting in relatively weak performance. This caused the price gap between the May and October terms to narrow. Spot cotton was firm. Later, industry peers and shorts bought in, and the market recovered slightly. However, large-scale profit taking and sales from New Orleans caused prices to weaken again. The closing was flat, with spot prices falling by 12 points and futures falling by 12 points to rising by 1 point. British cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures rose by 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to purchases by futures traders and European exporters, but weakened due to large-scale profit taking. Ultimately, various goods and stocks were strong, and shorts and the public bought in, causing prices to rise again. The final results were: Pingguo rose by 0.75 rupee, Aomla rose by 3.5 to 4.25 rupees, and Bairokh rose by 4 to 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 17th).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 18th is: Bairokh at 252 rupees, Aomla at 238.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Pingguo at 199.75 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Longs Accumulating, Forward Flour Particularly Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw firmness after the opening of the morning session. This was because the prices of foreign wheat in Chicago continued to be good, ranging from 245 cents, and in Canada, around 68 cents, and in Liverpool, up 2 pence. When prices opened, foreign wheat had risen for three or four days in a row, and this momentum was significant. However, as the near term was approaching settlement, the accumulated flour in this and other regions had very little real sales. In the midst of this surplus, confidence remained difficult to boost. The opening prices for March and April were only slightly better by one or two cents. Afterwards, both longs and shorts closed out in large quantities, and the market stabilized. June and July, on the other hand, saw good sentiment due to the high prices of foreign wheat, and rose by three or four cents. By the afternoon opening, both sides continued to close out March and April positions, and new trading was extremely sluggish. As a result, they only rose by two or three cents. July and August, on the other hand, saw long accumulation, and continuous cold and rainy weather made sentiment continue to be good for one or two cents. Based on the current situation, if there is no real sales support in the near term, the near and forward months may separate again.</p>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Dump, This Month's Wheat Plunges by 2.2 Cents</p>
<p>Forward New Wheat Unique in Spring Competition</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw the following: After the opening of the morning session, each month's market price rose by three, four, and five cents compared to the previous day due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat prices and the unfavorable weather. However, trading was sluggish, creating a stalemate. By the afternoon opening session, March and April were initially stable, but the Tianjin merchants' long positions in this month were sold off smoothly, causing sentiment to suddenly turn unfavorable and prices to plunge sharply. At the close, it was as low as $6.21. The price of April also fell by six cents compared to the initial opening price. June and later months had better sentiment due to the weather and foreign wheat, rebounding by three or four cents compared to the morning session. Spot wheat saw very few transactions, but the rain caused the price to improve slightly. The opening price for Jiangbei wheat was $6.37, and for Chongming wheat, $6.18, with only four or five hundred bags opened.</p>
<p>Puli Factory Soybean Cake Sold 8,000 Pieces</p>
<p>Tested by Shantou Merchants Yesterday</p>
<p>Soybean Sales Yard Continues to Be Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, Changzhou Puli Factory's four-brand soybean cake (Fat Brand) was inquired about by Shantou merchants, and 8,000 pieces were tested. Delivery was scheduled for the second half of March at a price of $2.08. Because it was the first time the price was opened, for the sake of courtesy, it was slightly more favorable compared to the prices of other factories. In addition, there were peddlers who wanted to trade, with a total transaction of 25,000 pieces of Dafu Factory's four-brand cake, including 1,000 pieces of spot goods at a price of $2.10, 13,000 pieces for April delivery at a price of $2.12, and 11,000 pieces for May delivery at $2.16. The market remained stable and there were no major changes. Soybean sales continued to be quiet, but sellers remained firm, resulting in a stalemate. Yesterday, only two cars of Yingzhou beans, 700 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 300 bags of Jiujiang winter beans, 50 bags of Shashi beans, and 150 bags of Du beans and Shahuang beans were opened.</p>
<p>Oil and Soybean Cake Still Without Honor or Disgrace</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard oil and soybean cake market still lacked honor or disgrace. Only standard beans were arriving in abundance as spot goods, and actual sales were quiet. Brokerages had standard shorted, and cake and oil sales were also weak. However, the Dalian market was firm, and factories and customers rarely sold short.

Later in the market, stimulated by bullish rumors, the market began to firm up. The swap rate was offered by bullish parties at 0.07 yuan yesterday.

<p>Overseas Silk Market Is Booming</p>
<p>Yokohama Spot Prices Soar by 35 Yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Transactions Total 229 Bales</p>

Although there were rumors in the market that the recent surge in the silk market was caused by speculators and short covering on the exchange, the daily increase in domestic and foreign silk prices still felt like the beginning of something big. Foreign firms in this port, such as Lianna, Yuanchang, and Yuanfeng, continued to take in new silk. There were transactions in both coarse and fine grades. Foreign firms and local users sold and opened positions with each other, with a total transaction volume of 229 bales.</p>
<h3>統計</h3>
<p>Shanghai Price Index for February</p>
<p>Has Recovered to Pre-Economic Recession Levels</p>
<p>36% Higher Than the Lowest Period</p>
<p>According to a report by the National Tariff Commission, the Shanghai wholesale price index and cost of living index (Note 1) for February 1937, compared with the previous month, wholesale prices continued to rise, while the cost of living remained unchanged. The total wholesale index was 122.9, an increase of 1.1% compared to the previous month and 16.6% compared to the same month last year, the highest index since December 1931. The impact of the world economic recession on China's prices began in the autumn of 1931. The Shanghai wholesale price index fell from 129.2 in September of that year to 90.5 in July 1935. As prices in various countries rebounded first and China implemented legal tender afterward, this index began to show an upward trend in November 1935. In the past three or four months, it has seen particularly rapid progress. This month's index is almost on par with the index during the economic recession (September 1935). The reason for the increase in this month's index is that it is the beginning of the Lunar New Year, and red markets typically rise, and the price of metals continued to rise sharply. The following is a comparison of the classified indices (Note 2) with the previous month:</p>
<p>Wholesale Classified Index 1. Compared with the previous month, the eight category indices showed a sharp rise in metals, a slight increase in miscellaneous goods and chemicals, and a slight decrease in fuels and building materials. The remaining three categories saw changes of less than 1%. The metal category index was 184.7, an increase of 7.1% compared to the previous month. Steel prices have generally risen sharply, and sales of various products have been quite smooth, so the red market prices have become even higher. The largest price increase was in French nails and white lead wire. The market price of French nails per barrel was 10.50 yuan last month and 13.00 yuan this month, an increase of 24%. The index for this category has been rising steadily since July last year, and the rise has been particularly sharp in the past four months. This month's index is 49% higher than the 123.7 in July last year. The main reason is the sharp increase in international market demand and soaring prices. The miscellaneous category index rose by 3.7% compared to the previous month. Enamel basins saw a price increase of more than 20% due to high raw material costs. Asphalt was selling well in foreign markets. Bran, raw cowhide, rough-edged paper, and newspapers were all in high demand and prices soared. The chemical category index rose by 1.1% due to the rise in alum and indigo oil. The fuel category index fell by 1.9%. Coal prices generally fell due to sluggish sales, and firewood prices also declined. The building materials category index fell by 1.1%. Liu'an boards, teak, and lime all saw weakness.</p>
<p>Wholesale Classified Index 2. Compared with the previous month, the two category indices both saw a slight increase. The raw material index rose by 0.1%. Among the four-month indices for this category, animal products and forestry products rose slightly, while mineral products and agricultural products fell slightly. Animal products rose by 1.3%. Pork and mutton prices rose along with raw cowhide due to high demand during the New Year. Forestry products rose by 0.3%. Asphalt, Douglas fir, and construction pine all saw rising prices. Mineral products fell by 0.4%. Although pig iron and alum both rose, coal prices generally fell, so the index still fell. Agricultural products fell by 0.1%. Suchang rice was active in both local and foreign sales. Jimoto rice prices rose due to demand during the New Year. Wheat also followed the upward trend of foreign markets. However, corn, sorghum, and beans generally fell due to sluggish sales, and tobacco leaves also saw a slight easing in prices as holders were eager to sell. The manufactured goods index rose by 1.5% compared to the previous month. The indices for both items in this category rose across the board. Among them, the producer goods index rose by 2.0%. Cotton yarn prices fell due to sluggish sales, and Japanese yarn prices plummeted. White silk prices fell sharply overseas, and foreign merchants were watching and exports were stagnant. Selling prices fell. According to New York telegraphs, the market price of silk from Shanghai factories was US$1.83 per pound on the 15th of this month, a decrease of more than 10% compared to the US$2.05 in the previous month. However, Jili dry silk saw a price increase due to a shortage of goods. Steel, iron, purple copper, bran, indigo oil, and newspapers also showed the same trend. The consumer goods index rose by 1.1%. Enameled basins, silk, and crepe all saw price increases due to the rise in raw material prices in recent months, which increased costs. Fine serge was being actively purchased in central China. Flour prices continued to rise with wheat prices. Prices for salmon, daylily, black dates, patterned labels, and rough-edged paper also rose. However, soybean oil prices have fallen frequently in recent markets. Fine twill and cotton gabardine saw sluggish sales. Fresh oranges arrived, sales were smooth, and hemp bags and Longkou vermicelli also fell.</p>

<p>Evening Banquet Hosted Jointly by the Chamber of Commerce and Four Other Groups</p>
<p>The first general membership meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association was held yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. One hundred and thirty-one members from both China and Japan attended. The meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the Association, Zhou Zuomin, who delivered a welcoming speech and report. This was followed by a speech by Mr. Kodama, Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association. Subsequently, two motions, including the completion of organization, were passed. Kodama Kenji and others also went to Zhou Zuomin's residence at 10:00 AM yesterday morning for a preliminary symposium, followed by a luncheon hosted by Zhou. In the evening, they attended a joint banquet hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and four other groups, adjourning around 4:00 PM. The details of each event are recorded below:</p>
<p>Symposium at Zhou's Residence: Kodama and others went out to visit friends yesterday morning. Around 10:00 AM, at the invitation of Zhou Zuomin, they went to Zhou's residence on Yuyuan Road for a symposium. Directors of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhi, Li Fusun, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, Zhong Bingfeng, Wu Yunzhai, Yoshida Seiji, Ube Takue, Yamamoto Takeo, and others were also invited to participate.

Therefore, they drafted two motions, including the completion of organizational preparation, to be submitted to the general meeting for discussion. At noon, Mr. Zhou hosted a special luncheon.

Members' seats were arranged in two rows, with a aisle in the middle leading directly to the platform. The press gallery was located on both sides at the rear of the room. Outside the venue, many police officers were on guard, and access was strictly controlled. After signing in, members were issued a triangular badge with a red ribbon to wear on their lapels. They were then led by ushers to the lounge to rest. At 3:30 PM, the meeting began with the ringing of a bell, and attendees entered the venue in an orderly fashion. Reporters from various newspapers with press passes were admitted upon presentation of their passes. The agenda of the general meeting was as follows: 1. Opening, 2. Secretary-General's Report, 3. Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association's Report and Welcoming Speech, 4. Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association's Speech and Report, 5. Discussion of Motions, 6. Speeches, 7. Photography, 8. Adjournment.</p>
<p>Attending Members: Those present yesterday included Chairman Zhou Zuomin, Vice-Chairmen Xu Xinliu and Kodama Kenji, Directors Li Fusun, Qian Xinzhi, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Liu Hongsheng, Yu Zuoting, Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Du Yuesheng, Zhong Bingfeng, Wu Zhenxiu, Wu Yunzhai, Lin Kanghou, Yoshida Seiji, Ube Takue, Yamamoto Takeo, and members from both China and Japan, including Wang Xiaolai, Yu Gumin, Wu Qiding, Song Hanzhang, Zhang Peishen, Guo Bingwen, Huang Jiangquan, Yin Tong, Yuan Liang, Ke Ganchen, Xu Xinliu, Wang Yiting, Chen Bofan, Lu Bohong, Lu Ziwen, Li Zhishi, Zhou Wenbin, Xu Xiuzhi, Wang Liangtong, Xu Xungong, Qin Runqing, Zhuang Dezhi, Ye Fuxiao, Dohi Sen, Yamamoto Hitoshi, Yamazaki Suisai, Tanabe Teruo, Yabuki Keiichi, Sato Kiichiro, Tsutsumi Takashi, Ueda Kenjiro, Tachibana Saburo, Tanabe Terugoro, Habu Yoshikichi, Yamanaka Kiichi, Tatsukawa Danzo, Ishida Hideji, as well as Kato Keizaburo, Miyakegawa Hyotaro, Miyajima Seijiro, Fujiyama Aiichiro, Hori Arata, Akiyama Akihisa, Iio Ichiji, Aburaya Boichi, Shoji Otokichi, Ohira Ken, Toyota Risaburo, Ishida Reisuke, and others who came from Japan to participate.

According to Article 11, Paragraph 3 of the Association's Constitution, a general membership meeting must have at least one-third of the total number of members present to be convened. The legal quorum has now been met, and the meeting can proceed.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the opening, Chairman Zhou Zuomin took the stage and said, "Chairman Kodama of the Japan-China Trade Association and all the members have taken time out of their busy schedules to attend this meeting from afar. The members of this association are truly grateful and admiring. On behalf of all the members of this association, I extend my highest respect and welcome. Since the establishment of this association, it has been a year and a half. During this period, due to the political environment, the association's affairs have not progressed as expected, which I deeply regret. However, most of the important figures in our country's economic circles have joined this association, which shows that people in our country have a considerable understanding and sympathy for this association. I believe that Japan also has the same trend. Although the members of this association on both sides are people from the business community and have nothing to do with politics, in the current international situation, politics and economics are indeed inseparable. China and Japan were originally like brotherly countries, as mentioned yesterday. Therefore, the economic co-prosperity of the two countries should be developed to the utmost extent, as is clear. However, looking at the trade situation, which is the most important and realistic aspect of the economic relationship between the two countries, last year, Japan's share of China's total foreign trade was only 15.49%. Also, last year, China's share of Japan's total foreign trade was only 7.3%. Although there has been an increase in the last three years, the ratio is still only that. It is obvious that there is still plenty of room for development. If there is great potential for development, but its efficiency is not fully realized, there must be an obstacle in the way. What is this obstacle? The thorny political issues are well known to the world. Now, it is necessary to open up the difficult situation with a new understanding, as also mentioned yesterday. We have all heard and greatly admired Chairman Kodama's repeated great speeches. We firmly believe that now is the opportune time for the relations between China and Japan to improve. The members of this association should help eliminate the obstacles to this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to achieve emotional harmony and make all necessary preparations for cooperation to await its realization. Finally, I hope that the members of this association will exchange opinions frankly and fully on all matters that this association should promote or reform during this short session, thereby increasing the efficiency of this association. I offer my most sincere prayers."</p>
<p>Kodama's Speech: This was followed by a speech by Chairman Kodama of the Japan-China Trade Association, who said, "I am greatly honored to participate in today's meeting as the Chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association and the Vice-Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. Chairman Zhou has already described the details of the association in detail, so I need not repeat them. I will briefly describe my impressions. The organization of this association began last year. At that time, the Chinese Economic Survey Mission went to Japan, and both China and Japan felt that it was a good opportunity. In order to make the relationship between the two sides more friendly, there was the organization of this association. Although the association has been established for a year and a half, none of the various hopes have been realized. The two associations in Tokyo and Shanghai have not had any actual consultations, which I deeply regret. This time, our delegation came to your country for inspection. After arriving in Shanghai, we went to Beijing. The impressions we received were very good. We had the honor of being received by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who gave a sincere speech, and met with various authorities of your country's government. After returning to Shanghai yesterday, we had several meetings with leading figures in the business community and influential people in the financial world. Although the time was very short and we did not discuss specific issues, we felt very happy. This alone is a prototype for future hopes, and I am sincerely pleased. Chairman Zhou mentioned just now that politics and economics have a close relationship. Due to the poor political environment, economic cooperation has encountered resistance. This is indeed an undeniable fact. However, the stimulation, environment, and atmosphere that we have obtained in your country this time are all very good. I firmly believe that if we take advantage of this good environment and atmosphere and work together, the expectation of friendship between the two sides will surely be achieved. I am willing to do my best for this, and I hope that you will all work together."</p>
<p>Passing of Resolutions: After the speeches, the resolutions were discussed: (1) Kodama Kenji, Zhou Zuomin, and Xu Xinliu proposed a motion to complete the organization of the association and prepare for its implementation. The motion stated: "Since the establishment of this association, due to environmental factors, it has not been able to progress as expected, which is greatly regretted. However, the establishment of this association originally had a purpose and a mission. To achieve its purpose and mission, it is natural to first determine the steps to be taken and complete the organization of its structure. This association sincerely hopes for the improvement of the environment, but if we wait until the environment improves before we start to implement it, we are afraid that it will be like digging a well when thirsty. Therefore, we should plan to complete the organization of the institution as soon as possible, and prepare all matters that should be prepared in a timely manner to await the opportunity and facilitate implementation. Among the things that should be prepared now, investigation and research should be the priority. Our two general associations originally have investigation departments, and we should immediately find suitable talents to take on their duties separately. Then, we should investigate and research in every way possible where this association can do its best, or accept the entrustment of various related parties and work on investigation and research within the possible scope, so that once the environment improves and the time for implementation arrives, it can be adopted. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly." The resolution was passed to proceed with organization based on the circumstances in both locations. (2) Kodama Kenji, Zhou Zuomin, and Xu Xinliu proposed a motion that members of the association should submit opinions on association affairs at any time and assist in construction. The motion stated: "The various matters that this association should prepare for implementation depend on the collective efforts of all to achieve the effect of collective effort. Since the colleagues of our two general associations are all influential figures in the economic circles of the two countries, if they have insightful opinions and matters that should be investigated and researched on various important matters of this association, they should be submitted to this association at any time so that we can consider handling them. If there are matters that need assistance from this association, we hope that they will not hesitate to provide support to facilitate implementation. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly." The resolution was passed. At 4:15 PM, after the discussion was completed, the entire group took photos in the main hall, had refreshments, and dispersed.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "Chairman Kodama, esteemed members, esteemed guests, I am deeply honored that you have taken time out of your busy schedules to grace us with your presence today. On behalf of the four associations, I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Kodama, all members, and guests, and to express our sincere welcome. However, our hospitality may not be adequate, which is not in accordance with the etiquette of welcoming our distinguished guests. I sincerely apologize for this, and I hope you will forgive us. Chairman Kodama and the members are willing to spend valuable time to improve relations between the two countries and have come to China from afar. Before you entered the country, I had the opportunity to read Chairman Kodama's great words and insightful comments in the newspapers, which gave the people of our country a very good impression. I deeply admire this and believe that the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations will be achieved as a result of your visit. In the past few days, the sincerity and enthusiasm with which our government and business community have received you fully demonstrates how eager our country, both in the government and among the people, hopes to improve Sino-Japanese relations. Since the September 18th Incident, it is undeniable that China and Japan have unfortunately been in a state of opposition. However, we will never be discouraged by this, and we feel that this is precisely why we need to make even greater efforts to improve relations between the two countries. You are all leaders and pioneers in the business community of your country, and you must have the power to guide public opinion in your country. I would like to take this opportunity to boldly represent the people of our country and express their true intentions, so that they can be conveyed to the people of your country. I believe that Chairman Kodama's statement that 'Sino-Japanese relations can only be opened up by deepening mutual understanding and cultivating mutual trust' is indeed a perfect statement. Only when the people of the two countries can truly achieve mutual understanding and mutual trust will there be true friendship between the two countries. Since you and I are all comrades who are working hard to promote friendship between the two countries, we should not simply engage in meaningless diplomatic rhetoric at today's meeting. We should frankly reveal our thoughts. I believe that all intelligent people will feel the same way. China is a peace-loving nation, which has been recognized by the world. Recently, feeling the urgency of the national crisis, we have realized that we must unite the national spirit, establish a completely independent and self-reliant modern country, and obtain equal status with other countries in order to achieve true peace. In particular, we deeply understand that only with equal and mutually beneficial friendship and genuine and sincere cooperation between China and Japan can we guarantee permanent peace in the Far East and promote world peace. This is the fundamental national policy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the national spirit of China today. Self-defense is a necessary means of seeking independent survival and is by no means caused without reason. Since the urgent need for friendship between China and Japan is our common belief, there is no need to mention economic cooperation. You have come here to promote economic cooperation between the two countries. We deeply feel that it is not only necessary for the economies of the two countries to cooperate, but also a necessary way to promote friendship between the two countries. Looking at the Sino-Japanese trade over the years, it has not decreased due to the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. On the one hand, this proves that China is by no means anti-Japanese, and on the other hand, it shows that the economies of the two countries have a close relationship. However, politics and economics are inextricably linked. Without improved political relations, economic relations cannot be promoted. Chairman Kodama once said that although there are many different opinions on economic cooperation, everyone sincerely feels that the improvement of friendly relations between China and Japan and the harmony of the people of the two countries are prerequisites. Under the circumstances of confrontation, it is extremely difficult to make cooperation proceed smoothly. This is indeed a penetrating statement. However, how to promote friendly relations between the two countries and how to reduce the difficulties in carrying out cooperation, in other words, how to eliminate the biggest obstacle between China and Japan at present, is nothing more than first improving the current special situation in North China. If you were to look at it from another perspective, you would have strange feelings. Your country has always believed in Confucius and respected the Kingly Way. Based on the principles of loyalty and forgiveness, the circumstances experienced by the citizens of China should be clear to you and need not be detailed. We have always admired Chairman Kodama and all of you as people who are truly working hard to promote friendship between China and Japan. Therefore, I take this opportunity to frankly express my thoughts without hesitation and ask for your candid advice. We will also accept it with twelve minutes of sincerity, which can be conveyed to our people. Only when we do not hold back at all and exchange our true intentions can the people of the two countries understand and trust each other. At this time of bright spring and the flourishing of all things, distinguished guests have come and are shaking hands and talking happily. The joy is difficult to express. From now on, the relations between the two countries will always be as bright as the spring sunshine, and the people of the two countries will go together on the road to prosperity. This trip by Chairman Kodama and others will not be in vain. I offer a toast to wish Chairman Kodama, all members, and all guests boundless happiness."</p>
<p>Kodama's Reply: Kodama Kenji, the head of the Japanese Economic Survey Mission, replied, "I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of the four associations. On behalf of the entire delegation, I would like to express my gratitude. The hopes we have for this trip to China have already been expressed to the correspondent of the Central News Agency stationed in Tokyo before we came to China. I believe you have already seen them. Moreover, what we wanted to say has been expressed completely by Chairman Wang's speech. I will listen carefully. However, I feel that there is a shortcoming. Most of you here are from the business community. According to our ideals, we should talk about business and what kind of business can make money and what kind of business will not lose money. However, what we are talking about is not this, but political issues. This is what we are ashamed of. I remember that I said yesterday that I hope that the people of the two countries can love each other so that we can hope for a solution to the national relations problem. In the work of making the people of the two countries reach mutual love, we can certainly not talk about politics. Today, China and Japan can take advantage of the banquet to express their thoughts and open their hearts, which is a good phenomenon that we have not seen since arriving in China. We hope that the feelings of the people of the two countries will gradually get closer from now on to achieve the goal of true friendship. Now, I would like to use the host's cup of wine to wish you all good health."</p>
<p>Entertainment to Entertain Guests: After the banquet, the four associations held entertainment activities at the association to entertain the guests. The Pudong Native Place Association specially sent Cai Futang as a representative to entertain. The entertainment program was Peking opera: (1) Xiao Gai Jiaotian's "Water Curtain Cave," (2) Lin Shusen and Cheng Shaoyu's "The Old City Instructing the Younger Brother," (3) Qilin Tong Wang Yunfang's "Aspiring to Join the Army," (4) Liang Xiujuan's "The Thirteenth Sister," Kun opera Zhang Chuanfang, Zhu Chuanming, Zhou Chuanying's "Touring the Garden and Startling the Dream," and stacking flowers.</p>
<p>Today's Receptions: Mayor Wu Tiecheng has specially scheduled a banquet at the City Hall at 12:30 PM today to entertain Kodama and others. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the Shipping Association will hold a tea party at the Guangdong Road Club. In the evening, Japanese Consul General stationed in Shanghai, Kawasai Tatsuo, will host a banquet to welcome them.</p>

<p>Municipal Discussion Conference Discussion Issues and Explanations (1) Review of the current municipal system (Explanation) The Guangzhou Municipal Government was established in 1920 when Sun Yat-sen served as the Extraordinary President. This was the earliest municipal government in Chinese history. In 1927, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, establishing the three special municipalities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. Since then, many cities have been established across the country, most of which have existed for ten years, except for Guangzhou, or at least several years. During these ten years, the Municipal Organization Law has been amended twice, once in 1928 and once in 1930. The current administrative system of various cities is based on the Municipal Organization Law amended and promulgated on May 20, 1930. Domestic municipal administrators have a considerable understanding of this current system. It is thought that European and American countries have a longer history of municipal administration than China, and their spirit of research and improvement increases with each year, enduring and unremitting, and is worthy of emulation. It is proposed to invite representatives and experts from various provinces and cities to take advantage of the Shanghai Municipal Government's tenth anniversary to conduct a review of the current municipal system for academic research and administrative reference. (2) The impression felt by citizens in the implementation of current municipal laws and regulations in various cities (Explanation) Various cities have formulated various individual laws and regulations and publicly announced rules to meet their needs. The purpose of laws and regulations is: 1. To define the scope and standards of administration; 2. To determine the rights and obligations of citizens; 3. To maintain public safety, health, and order; 4. To crack down on bad habits and behaviors. The above points are originally intended to protect, educate, and nurture the people and to enable administrative officials to know what to follow. However, what is the impact on citizens since the implementation of various laws and regulations, and are there any improvements that can be made based on the experience of implementation? It is proposed to take advantage of the tenth anniversary of Shanghai to conduct a review in principle and welcome citizens to express fair and practical opinions for reference in municipal administration. (3) The difficulties felt in the implementation of current central laws and regulations related to municipal administration (Explanation) The original intention of the central government in promulgating various laws and regulations related to municipal administration is to unify administrative laws and regulations and facilitate the people. However, the distribution of cities across the country, the customs and economic conditions of the people are different, and the environment is different. While many implementations are smooth, difficulties are also not uncommon. It is proposed to invite representatives and experts from various provinces and cities to express their opinions and discuss them in detail for central selection. (4) Discussion on municipal policy guidelines (Explanation) Municipal affairs are numerous and complicated. It is impossible to do everything at once. Regardless of domestic and foreign cities, it is not allowed due to limited human and financial resources. Only by considering national conditions, establishing policy guidelines, and determining the order of business based on the importance and urgency of the business can we proceed. The significance of this topic is to discuss a municipal policy guideline suitable for national conditions in principle, within the scope of economic permission in various places, under the national standing, and to give examples for reference by various cities.</p>
<p>Measures for Hosting Representatives and Experts from Various Provinces and Cities at the Municipal Discussion Conference 1. Representatives and experts from various provinces and cities shall report to the Preparatory Office of the Conference no later than 4:00 PM on July 6, 1937. 2. Representatives and experts from various provinces and cities shall be responsible for their own round-trip transportation and travel expenses. Meals and vehicles during the conference shall be provided by the Municipal Discussion Conference. Escorts should take care of themselves. 3. If representatives and experts from various provinces and cities need to book a hotel, please notify the Preparatory Office of the Conference before June 15th, and specify the grade, number of people, etc. for contact purposes. 4. The Preparatory Office of the Municipal Discussion Conference is located in the Public Utilities Bureau in the center of Shanghai. The telephone numbers are 7721 in the urban area and 46280 in the special district, and the cable registration number is 8338 for communication.</p>

Then, Inspector General Mei delivered a speech, and finally, General Manager Jiali Ai of the Java China Japan Line gave a reply on behalf of the shipping industry, expressing his gratitude (the speech is omitted). The guests and hosts dispersed in joy at around 11 PM.</p>
<p>Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Tonight, I am deeply honored to have the authorities of the Customs, health officials, and leaders of the Chinese and foreign shipping industries grace us with their presence. This is the sixth annual banquet, and I am able to gather with you all. Therefore, I will briefly contribute some humble words and hope for your guidance. In the past few years, the shipping industry has provided a great deal of assistance and cooperation to us. I hope that we will continue to promote this spirit in the future. Our goal is to apply the latest international quarantine methods. With the assistance of the shipping industry, quarantine work can be further improved. Regarding the policy of quarantine management, we adhere to the following main principles: We share the responsibility of epidemic prevention with various coastal countries, closely supervise diseases transmitted by ships, and at the same time, we try to facilitate imported ships without interference, so as not to affect the prosperity of the port. Now, let me give you an example. In 1932, due to the tidal water of the Huangpu River, if all imported ships were to anchor in Wusong to wait for inspection, it would take too much time. Therefore, it was decided that from that year onwards, all ships could temporarily enter the port and dock for inspection, provided that they reported the situation on board in advance. Everything was normal, and there were no quarantinable diseases or deaths. The adoption of this measure seemed quite revolutionary, but judging from the results of the past few years, it can indeed prove the appropriateness of our handling. This reform has not hindered our work in any way or reduced its effectiveness, and our relationship with the shipping industry has increased because of this. It is now heard that the health authorities of the Port of New York in the United States have recently made a similar reform, that is, under certain conditions, passenger ships can directly enter the port without having to wait on the quarantine island. Although we boldly took this measure six years ago, we are not complacent about it, because we are not bound by traditional habits, and we are not afraid to implement reforms that do not conflict with the fundamental principles of quarantine. We now gradually understand the cause of diseases and their transmission, rather than the previous blind fear, so all preventive methods are also more rationalized, and harbor quarantine can be integrated with industry and commerce, no longer trapped in isolation. Taking this port as an example, we have received a lot of assistance from the shipping industry. The relationship between customs and quarantine is very close. Before the establishment of the current harbor quarantine agency, all quarantine work in various ports was handled by the customs, which laid the foundation for the existing quarantine organization in our country. Until 1930, the Harbor Quarantine Station was established and gradually took over the quarantine affairs of various ports. The customs side still provided assistance to ensure smooth progress. We are very grateful for the sincere assistance of Inspector General Mei Lehe, various customs supervisors, commissioners, and staff. Now, please allow me to briefly describe the general situation of this port's work last year. The inspection affairs are very busy, and all colleagues are working hard. The total tonnage of imported ships was more than 14 million tons, with a total of 1,821 ships. In terms of tonnage, the United Kingdom ranks first, followed by Japan, and the United States ranks third. In terms of nationality, there are a total of 14 countries. The number of imported passengers is about 113,000 (including 50,000 Chinese). Violations of quarantine regulations have been greatly reduced, which shows that the spirit of cooperation in the shipping industry is improving. Although fumigation affairs have not developed, everything is proceeding as usual. The fumigation equipment in Shanghai is the latest type, and the certificates issued are recognized by various countries without any difficulties. The seventh report of this station is now in print. When you receive it in the future, you will know that we are not only busy dealing with daily work, but also committed to scientific research related to quarantine. The cholera overview and plague overview we have compiled have been published successively and have been well received by the medical community at home and abroad. Finally, I would like to thank you all for attending this annual banquet. I and all my colleagues would like to raise a glass to wish all the guests good health.</p>
<p>Mei Lehe's Speech</p>
<p>Tonight, I am greatly honored to be invited by Director Wu to attend this grand banquet. I am even more terrified to be mentioned for the assistance of the Customs to quarantine and to be praised so much. Director Wu's work achievements are known to both China and foreign countries and need not be repeated by me. He presided over the epidemic prevention work in the Northeast as early as 1910, with remarkable results, and was promoted as an authority in the medical field, and his reputation has grown. In recent years, the government has given him the important position of harbor quarantine, and he has made many contributions. Tracing back to 1930, he took over all the quarantine affairs under the management of the Customs and worked hard to rectify them. Taking this port as an example, its achievements are no less than those of other important ports in the world. It also provides convenience to imported ships, and at the same time, it does not reduce the efficiency of quarantine. Chinese and foreign merchants unanimously praised it. In addition to admiration, I am deeply grateful to the government for getting the right person. Now, I would like to wish Director Wu and his colleagues success in their careers and unlimited future.</p>
<h3>Representatives from All Walks of Life Held a Memorial Meeting for "March 18th" Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Whole City Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Express Mourning</p>
<p>Guomin News reports that yesterday was the "March 18th" Beijing Revolutionary Memorial Day. The Municipal Party Department of this city convened representatives from all walks of life at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the department to hold a memorial meeting. Those present included Jiang Hao, member of the Municipal Party Department; Huang Zao Xiong of the Municipal Education Association; Lin Kecong of the Municipal Women's Association; Du Mengsen of the Cooperative Business Promotion Association; Huang Xianggu of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association; Mao Yun of the Second Special Municipality Residents Association; Li Weiliang of the Living Mutual Aid Society; Hu Shouqi of the Southern District Residents Association; Li Jirong of the Zhiguang Society; and the guilds of inlaying teeth, warehouses, the First District Shui Mu, and other labor unions; the Jiangsu Ningbo and other fellow villagers associations; and representatives from schools such as Minli, Shangren, Dezhi, and Da Zhonghua, totaling over two hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The report was given by Chairman Jiang Hao, who stated, "Representatives, comrades, today is the anniversary of the 'March 18th' Beijing people's revolution. Let me first report on the facts of this event. In the spring of 1926, the Zhilu Allied Army and the National Army were in a stalemate in the Pingjin area. In order to prevent the Zhilu Army's Bohai Fleet from attacking, the National Army blockaded the Dagukou and prohibited the passage of all Chinese and foreign ships. It is the right of an independent country to block its own sea mouth in its territorial waters, but the imperialists do not care about your rights. Japanese warships deliberately sailed in first and bombarded Dagukou on March 12th. Not only that, but on March 16th, the Dutch minister, on behalf of the countries of the Boxer Protocol, invoked the Boxer Protocol, issued an ultimatum, and mobilized warships of various countries to carry out threats. At this point, the people of Beijing, seeing the Beijing warlord government's repeated acts of appeasement and humiliation of the country, expected that it would yield and recognize its demands. Therefore, on March 18th, they held a national assembly outside Tiananmen, gathered to discuss countermeasures, and petitioned the Executive Government. Who knew that the Executive Government not only did not accept the people's well-intentioned advice, but ordered the guards to open fire and strafe the people. As a result, more than fifty people were martyred on the spot, more than seventy were seriously injured, and countless were slightly injured. This is the heroic sacrifice suffered by the people of the Northern Revolution who fought against the warlord government and imperialists to safeguard national rights. From the revelation of this incident, we can clearly know that the warlords are completely motivated by personal interests. They only seek temporary peace and preserve their territory. They do not hesitate to kneel before the enemy and offer the country's lifeline and people's lives with both hands. On the one hand, they regard the people as the only enemy and use their power, resorting to both knives and guns. As for the imperialists, their only premise for weak nations is to invade them to their heart's content. They play with those warlords and traitors who sell the country for glory according to their whims. Only for the revolutionary people, they are afraid on the one hand and regard them as the only enemy on the other hand, and use various direct and indirect methods to kill them. We know the true face of the warlords and imperialists. We know that the people of Beijing suffered this heroic sacrifice under the dual oppression of the warlords and imperialists. What is the significance of our commemoration of them today? Many revolutionary people in Beijing sacrificed under the destruction of the evil forces of the warlords and imperialists eleven years ago. Now let's take a look at our real environment. After the success of the Northern Expedition, the evil forces of the warlords were indeed overthrown one by one, but are not most of the predecessors of many traitors who sell their motherland and their souls today warlords? As for imperialism, let's take a look at the situation in recent years since 1926. The May 3rd Massacre, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, and the banditry in the three provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Sui are not all good gifts bestowed by our neighbors? In our current environment, the suffering caused by the remnants of the warlords, the traitors, and the imperialists is a hundred times greater than before 1926. The only significance of our commemoration of the 'March 18th' martyrs today is to emulate the spirit of sacrificing for the country of the predecessors, unite together, and strive forward on the bloody road to save the country from disaster. On the one hand, everyone should vigorously implement the New Life Movement, so that the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame can be realized in the actual life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Then we can create citizens with high morals, rich knowledge, and strong physique. Everyone can be a modern citizen with the highest combat power. On the one hand, we must vigorously implement the National Economic Construction Movement, save everyone's waste, and concentrate the country's financial resources to enrich the lives of the people and build the national economic power of national defense. Enriching the individual's intellectual, moral, and physical education and building the economic power of the national lifeline are the two major basic tasks for saving the country at present. We must save the country and ourselves. Only by making these two tasks our lifelong goals can we succeed. At the same time, at present, we must eliminate the Red bandits and traitors in order to eliminate the hidden loyalty within our nation and achieve the practical effect of securing the country internally and resisting foreign aggression. Comrades, today we commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed in the 'March 18th' in Beijing. We must complete the mission that we should continue to strive for. We can only support the overall national policy of the central government and work together under the leadership of the great leader Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans</p>
<p>Memorial slogans: (1) "March 18th" is the memorial day for the Beijing people's sacrifice for the country. (2) To commemorate "March 18th", we must eliminate the remaining Red bandits.

<h3>Kowloon Representatives Going to Beijing, Lu Zhang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Outcome of Discussions Was Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government's forceful demolition of the walled city of Kowloon and the expulsion of its residents has aroused resentment among Kowloon residents. They elected Lu Zhang as their representative to go to Beijing to petition the central government, requesting the government to quickly negotiate with the British side. Lu, upon receiving the order, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and immediately transferred to Beijing to petition. Having completed his mission, he returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to a statement to the Central News Agency reporter, after arriving in Beijing, he met successively with the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Interior to petition. The outcome was very satisfactory. Foreign Minister Wang paid particular attention to the case. He personally presented three requests to Foreign Minister Wang: ㊀ earnestly requesting the government to quickly negotiate with the British government, ㊁ earnestly requesting the government to quickly protect the safety of Kowloon residents, and ㊂ earnestly requesting the government to demand compensation from the British government for the losses suffered by Kowloon residents. Foreign Minister Wang accepted all these requests. Believing that his mission was accomplished, he plans to return south within days.</p>
<h3>Successful Trial Run of the New Shanghai-Quanzhou Route</h3>
<p>New Maritime Chart No. 975 Completed; Changfeng Ship Successfully Completed Trial Voyage</p>
<p>Over the years, dozens of ships sailing between Shanghai and Quanzhou, Fujian, have struck reefs and sunk, resulting in losses of life and property amounting to tens of millions of dollars. Last year, Xu Zufan of the insurance industry and Yao Shumin of the shipping industry requested the Naval Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of the Navy to survey and chart a new waterway for this route. They also requested the Customs Port Affairs Office to establish indicators along the Shanghai-Quanzhou sea route.</p>
<p>All Completed</p>
<p>Generally, two red and black buoys are set up at Jixinqi (i.e., south of Dazhui Island) to guide merchant ships through the shoals between Dazhui and Xiaozhui Islands. In addition, two navigation marker poles are set up near Rihu Pagoda to guide merchant ships past the shoals south of Xiaozhui Island. Also, Jixinqi is equipped with red and black lighted buoys; fearing that they may be moved by tides and waves, the two marker poles will serve as accurate indicators. Other lighthouses have been added along the new route. From now on, the Shanghai-Quanzhou route can be permanently safe. After the completion of this project, the Customs has notified shipping companies. The Minxin Shipping Company of this port immediately dispatched the Changtai ship as a</p>
<p>Route Lighthouse</p>
<p>in order to ensure permanent safety. After many months of surveying and charting, the Hydrographic Office has now completed the survey and charted the new Quanzhou sea route, listed as No. 975. The chart details the hidden reefs and shoals near Dazhui and Xiaozhui Islands, as well as the rise and fall of tides. The water depth within the new channel is very deep. At the shallowest point, there are thirty feet at high tide and fifteen feet at low tide. Even deep-draft seagoing ships can safely navigate at half-tide without any danger. As for the establishment of navigation lighthouses and other facilities by the Customs, the Changtai ship has already completed the</p>
<p>Trial Voyage on the New Route</p>
<p>The ship traveled from Shanghai to Quanzhou and back to Shanghai, following this new route in accordance with the new chart No. 975 and the lighthouses and marker poles set up by the Customs. It has arrived safely without any danger. Shipping companies and insurance firms are very satisfied with the facilities provided by the Hydrographic Office and the Customs.</p>
<h3>Brief Shipping Report</h3>
<p>The Craigned, which ran aground and sank off Sydney, Australia, was purchased by Chinese merchants in this port and used for dismantling after arriving in Shanghai. It ran aground and sank off Sydney on the 15th of this month. It sank into the sea in just one hour. All the crew members escaped safely, and none were killed. The shipowner is named Lair. This ship was insured by the American Asia Insurance Company of this port. Because it was not used for navigation, it was not registered with the Maritime Administration Bureau. The shipwrecked crew members are now returning to Shanghai on another ship.</p>
<p>The Sanbei Hongheng ship ran aground on the Jiangkou River in the upper reaches on the 16th and could not be freed for a while. The Hongzhen ship has now been dispatched with a barge to unload cargo. News was received yesterday that the Hongheng had not yet been towed out of the shallows.</p>
<p>Sichuan suffered a severe drought last year, and food is scarce for the people. A large quantity of rice has been purchased from Hankou, Jiujiang, and Wuhu to provide relief. Due to shallow waters blocking the Sichuan River waterway, various shipping companies are now transferring the cargo to Shashi and using civilian boats to transport it into Sichuan.</p>
<p>In the case of the Haiheng ship colliding with a sampan, resulting in two deaths, the family members of the deceased went to the China Merchants Bureau yesterday to seek compensation. The Bureau refused because the fault lies with the sampan. The local court also sent a summons to the Bureau yesterday, calling on the ship's senior crew members to appear in court for questioning. The Bureau decided to submit a written statement of reasons, stating that the case has been reported to the Maritime Administration Bureau and, according to regulations, is not under the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<h3>Patrick Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Returned from Inspection in South China</p>
<p>Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, went to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong on the 2nd of this month to inspect the economic situation in South China. After half a month, Patrick, believing that his mission was completed, took the McKinley President of the Dollar Steamship Company from Hong Kong and returned north, arriving here at 8:30 yesterday morning. His secretary, Solley, and others arrived at the port to welcome him. Patrick's itinerary has been formally announced in Hong Kong. It is understood that Patrick will rest briefly in Shanghai before going to North China and Central China to inspect.</p>
<h3>All Silk Weaving Workers in the City Resumed Work as Ordered</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, after the Party and government authorities jointly issued a notice prohibiting strikes in the city's silk factories, the workers, in order to show their obedience, all resumed work last night in the seventeen silk factories in Pudong, Puxi, and Zhabei that were on strike.</p>
<h3>He Yaozu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Envoy to Turkey, He Yaozu, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 7:00 yesterday morning. Whether He's resignation has been withdrawn is reportedly still under consideration, so there is no definite date for when he will go to Turkey to resume his post.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing's Remarks on the Wugu Village Case</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Did Not Report to the Board of Directors; Directors Raised Questions During the Meeting</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, regarding the dispute caused by residents of Wugu Village, who refused to pay Municipal Council house tax, after the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Council agreed on a solution, a reporter interviewed Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Municipal Council, yesterday to inquire about his thoughts on the case. He replied that some of the residents there have paid the house tax, while others have not. This matter should have been resolved through consultation with the Municipal Government. The fault does not lie with the residents. The Municipal Council's decisive handling of this matter was also inappropriate. The case was never reported to the Board of Directors, so it was not known in advance. During the Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting yesterday (the 17th), some directors raised questions. Subsequently, the Director-General reported that a peaceful resolution had been reached.</p>

<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Association Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cai Shengbai Reported on the Situation of the Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Factory Operators Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, with over thirty people in attendance. Cai Shengbai, chairman of the association, reported that the history of the silk weaving industry in Shanghai is only about twenty years. Before the founding of the Republic of China, there was nothing worth mentioning. The Wuhua Factory first started it, and gradually others followed, increasing the number of looms to about 8,000. However, before 1927, there were only about 2,000 looms in Shanghai. After the January 28th Incident, due to the influence of the economic environment, the number of looms decreased sharply from 7,000 or 8,000 to just over 4,000. Until recently, it has increased slightly to just over 5,000. The reasons for the increases and decreases can be stated as follows: 1. Due to the diligence and thrift of the operators; 2. Due to the influence of the social economy. The silk weaving industry in Shanghai, except for a few factories like Meiya, Tianyi, Meiwen, Damei, and Meifeng, which have a larger number of looms, most others have only dozens or as few as two or three looms. It seems that they have not yet broken away from the model of family industry, and there are absolutely no capitalists who invest heavily to operate them. Therefore, most of the silk weaving factory owners in Shanghai are former silk weaving workers. They usually use their wages to save money and buy one or two looms to weave in their homes, working hard day and night and never leaving the position of laborers. When they become slightly better off, they dare not enjoy themselves and add more looms. The weavers they hire are either relatives or friends, maintaining their relationship through emotions and not bound by conditions. Many factories have gradually expanded their base in this way. Therefore, other industries may have so-called capitalists, but there are no capitalists in the silk weaving industry in Shanghai. Even in the case of Meiya and Tianyi, there are quite a few workers who are shareholders. After 1927, the number of looms gradually increased because the workers' skills gradually matured and their savings gradually became considerable, so they all bought their own looms. This is the real factor in increasing the number of looms. It is not that capitalists saw that there was profit to be made and hurriedly invested. After the January 28th Incident, due to the bankruptcy of the rural areas and the decline of the social economy, all industries were in decline. Civilians had little surplus power to buy cloth, and silk became a surplus commodity. In general, silk weaving factories, due to their nature as family industries, had no liquid funds to accumulate inventory, so they had to stop their machines and close their businesses. Among them, those with a solid foundation, for the sake of ensuring the livelihood of their workers, worked hard to support themselves and maintain their operations, but they were also in difficult and arduous circumstances, barely making ends meet. The hardships in this situation are beyond the knowledge of outsiders. We are engaged in business, half of which is for the sake of our own livelihood, and half of which is not for the sake of the country and the nation. Silk satin is originally a unique and superior product of our country. Before the silk weaving industry was developed, imported goods poured in. In recent years, domestically produced silk satin has improved in technology and increased in production, and imported goods have gradually declined. This is not unrelated to the efforts of the domestic silk weaving industry to reduce a part of the outflow of wealth. Therefore, even after experiencing hardships, we still support them. If you ask whether there is a foreign silk weaving factory in Shanghai, you can understand it. Last year's bumper harvest of agricultural products caused all industries to turn around slightly, and outsiders thought that the silk weaving industry must also benefit from it. Who knows that the distress of the silk weaving industry has not decreased? In the first half of the year, silk sales did not increase much, and the price of silk from the previous year rose sharply, and the cost was extraordinarily high, but the price of silk supply and demand did not reach an equal relationship, and it could not be raised. In the second half of the year, silk sales seemed to move, but the price of silk rose sharply again due to the movement of foreign traders, which increased the cost of silk satin, but it was difficult for the selling price to be in an equal proportion to the cost. Even if there was a small profit, it was only enough to pay official interest, and there was no dividend to be obtained. This can be verified by the final accounts reports of various factories. In short, the silk weaving industry has never reached the ideal realm of affluence, and in the midst of the hardships of the past few years, it has never forgotten the national industry of the country, and it must be fully revitalized, or at least maintained without defeat. Therefore, the total monthly output of silk fabrics in the city last year reached 160,000 pieces in the busiest month, and the annual average was worth about 30 million yuan, accounting for one-fifth of the national silk fabric production, which seems to have fulfilled one or two responsibilities for the national product, without self-reproach. However, due to the dumping of smuggled goods, it is even more difficult to make a profit on the selling price. After the great closure last year, the factories this year started work extremely late, because sales are not moving, the economy is not easy to turn around, and they have to reluctantly start work because they are worried about the livelihood of the workers. Also, last winter, in order to assist the government in cracking down on smuggling, the association vigorously carried out anti-smuggling work within the industry. All silk weaving factories in the city joined the association in order to carry out national law and enthusiastically love the country, so as to increase the strength of the association. The products of the industry are all investigated by the association's personnel to investigate the source of its raw materials, and to audit its consumption and inventory. Each piece of finished product is stamped with the association's certification stamp. The customs can allow it to purchase rayon and release the finished product only with the association's certificate. Since the implementation of this anti-smuggling work, rayon smuggling has become more difficult to import and cannot be sold. According to the Customs report, very few confiscated smuggled rayon have been found recently. However, the association's expenses have increased sharply due to the vigorous anti-smuggling work, which is all jointly borne by the industry. We claim that we dare not lag behind others in loving the country, and we do not only think of our own interests, but we put the country and the nation first. However, the members of the association have little knowledge and are always in danger of failing. I hope that the society will give guidance and assistance at any time, which is really hoped for.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Health Department's Budget for This Year</h3>
<p>Approximately 5% Higher Than Last Year</p>
<p>The draft budget for the expenditure of the Health Department of the Municipal Council for 1937 has been reviewed by the Council's Board of Directors and approved for consideration by the Finance Committee. The main points are supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Recurring Expenditures</p>
<p>Excluding the purchase of supplies, allowances, and subsidies, a total of 1,809,600 yuan is required, an increase of 168,880 yuan over the previous year, which is approximately 12%. According to the Director of the Health Department, all kinds of expenditures have been rigorously budgeted and cannot be saved any further. This year, the Department plans to hire two assistant physicians and one temporary assistant physician, respectively, for school medical affairs, prison hospitals, and summer and autumn cholera eradication campaigns. The required expenditures have been included in the budget. The expenses required for mosquito eradication have been increased by 20,950 yuan. There are many facilities that need to be expanded for this kind of work, but due to financial constraints, they have been reduced to a minimum. In order to prevent smallpox and cholera, it is planned to add four full-time nurses. The required expenses have been included in the budget. After studying the above-mentioned entire budget, the Director of Finance reduced the amount as appropriate and set it at 1,711,400 yuan, an increase of approximately 5% over the previous year. The expenses of the chemical laboratory, pharmacy, and various hospitals have increased, and the income of the slaughterhouse and meat market has decreased. The French Concession Municipal Council has independently devised a method to eradicate mosquitoes, and has stopped subsidizing the expenses required by the Municipal Council for this matter. These facts are all the reasons for the increase in expenditures.</p>
<p>(B) Special Expenditures</p>
<p>Special expenditures are divided into two categories, A and C. Category A is those that have been approved by the Board of Directors or are considered important. Category C is those that should not be allocated this year in terms of economic conditions and other aspects. The details are as follows: ㊀ Expanding the West District Infectious Disease Hospital, adding a land purchase fee of 41,000 yuan, listed in Category A. ㊁ The construction cost is tentatively set at 599,450 yuan, of which 300,000 yuan is for the construction of the West District Infectious Disease Hospital, 125,000 yuan is for the reconstruction of the Aerodrome Road vegetable market, and 35,000 yuan is for the addition of the Avenue Edward VII sanitary branch, all of which are listed in Category C. The project fee for the slaughterhouse and cattle shed, in addition to the part that has been spent last year, still requires 20,000 yuan. The project fee for the slaughterhouse's pig slaughtering place is 26,000 yuan, the machinery and equipment are 35,000 yuan, and the equipment fee for the central laundry is 20,000 yuan, all of which are listed in Category A.</p>
<h3>Bad Children Stole Letters from Mailboxes and Tore Off Stamps to Exchange for Money</h3>
<p>Stole As Many As Thirteen Letters in Total; Arrested and Interrogated After Being Reported by Postman; Small Tobacco and Paper Shop Owner Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Zhou Mingbiao and Zhu Amao, two twelve-year-old children from Ningbo, stole as many as thirteen letters from the postal mailbox at Avenue Petain and Dalianwan Road at 7:45 PM on the 9th of this month. They tore off the stamps and exchanged them for newspapers and copper coins at nearby tobacco and paper shops, totaling seventeen stamps of one fen, five fen, and ten fen. The case was discovered when postman Zhou Xinyi reported to the Yulin Road police station. Detective Li Hongsheng arrested the two children and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention pending trial. During the trial, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case found that the stolen stamps had been sold to Hu Dongchen, a Zhenjiang native who opened a small tobacco and paper shop at No. 335 Avenue Petain. They went to investigate and found old stamps of one fen (two pieces), two fen (one piece), and three jiao (one piece). Hu Dongchen claimed that the stamps from the two children were handled by his son, Hu Shixian, and he was unaware of them. Yesterday morning, the police station summoned Hu and his son and sent them to the Third Criminal Court along with Zhou and Zhu. Zhang Tianyin, the Municipal Council's lawyer, stated that Zhou had a pawn ticket for seventeen yuan, which was found to be owned by someone named Jia, who works at the World Book Company in Shanghai. Hu Dongchen and his son were prosecuted for receiving stolen goods. Zhou confessed that he sold two five-fen stamps to Hu Shixian, getting twenty-five copper coins, giving twelve coins to Zhu and exchanging the rest for newspapers, so that he could stuff them into the mailbox to pad the bottom and steal letters. Zhu insisted that Zhou invited him to help steal letters and peel off stamps. Hu Dongchen confessed that his three-jiao stamp was returned by a Qingkou person who sent an airmail letter and exchanged it for a five-fen stamp to keep in the store, not from the two children. Hu Shixian's confession was evasive, and he hired a lawyer to request bail. Judge Chuan Lin ordered Zhou and Zhu to be remanded in custody, and Hu Dongchen and Hu Zhixian were each allowed to stop detention with a 200-yuan bond, and the case was changed to a hearing.</p>

<h3>Zhu Xuefan Left the Country Yesterday to Attend the International Textile and Labor Conferences</h3>
<p>Two Proposals to Inspect Factories and Stop Smuggling; Zhu Published a Written Statement on the Ship</p>
<p>Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union Committee, was appointed by the Central Government as a representative to attend the World Textile Conference and the Labor Representative to the 23rd International Labor Conference. Zhu boarded the McKinley President of the Dollar Steamship Company yesterday morning at 11:30 AM and set sail. The city's labor community held a grand send-off. Zhu published a statement on the ship, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Send-Off</p>
<p>Those who went to the Bund Customs Wharf yesterday morning to send off Zhu included Du Yuesheng and his son Weifan, Huang Renzhi, Huang Bodu, Lin Kanghou, Director Cai Jinjun's representative Chen Guangzong, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Ye Xianggao, Gong Yuting, Wu Shaoshu, Sun Lufing, Chen Haifeng, Zhao Banfu, Xu Caicheng, Zhang Kechang, Yu Yaoqiu, Lu Muqin, Guo Lanxin, Tang Shichang, and various groups, including Heng She, Yi She, Yongjin She, the Twenty-Two Societies Association of Caojiadu, the Labor Association, and various labor unions, including the National Postal, Shanghai Postal, Postal Workers, Fourth District Cigarette, First District Water and Electricity, Tenth District Cotton Spinning, British Tramway, Ninth District Soap and Medicine, Military Uniform, Automobile Driver and Training Team, Tug and Barge, Wharf Mutual Aid Association, First District Cosmetics, Huxi Nissha Welfare Society, Fourth District Rubber, Sauce Industry, Tang Tablets, Brewing, Hotel, Seventh District Silk Weaving, Fifth District Shoulder Carrying, Civilian Boat, Fourth District Hat Making, Third District Silk Weaving, Pharmaceutical Industry, and Fifth District Papermaking, etc. Various schools included Minli Middle School, Yangjian Primary School, Lunshan Children's Primary School, and Lunshan Woodworking Research Primary School, with more than 1,000 representatives gathering at the wharf to send off, setting off firecrackers, and hiring several small ferries to accompany them, with extremely enthusiastic emotions.</p>
<p>Going Abroad to Attend the Meeting</p>
<p>Zhu arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 10:30 AM. After bidding farewell to the well-wishers, he took the scheduled Yuebao small ferry to Bailianjing and transferred to the Dollar Steamship Company's McKinley President ship, which set sail from Shanghai at 11:30 AM. After Zhu arrives in the United States, he will attend the World Textile Conference held in Washington on April 2, and then proceed to Geneva to attend the 23rd International Labor Conference on June 3. Then, he will go to the UK for inspection and is expected to return to China and Shanghai in early August.</p>
<p>Our Proposals</p>
<p>We have no proposals for the World Textile Conference. However, at the meeting, our country's employer and labor representatives will make a detailed report on the current situation of the textile industry in our country for reference by the conference. As for the 23rd International Labor Conference, our country has two official proposals: ㊀ Factory inspection; ㊁ Stopping smuggling. In addition, we will make greater efforts to promote the implementation of the case of equal treatment for Chinese and foreign workers, which was proposed at the last (20th) conference.</p>
<p>Farewell Remarks</p>
<p>Zhu published a written statement to reporters on the ship, saying that he was appointed as a representative to attend the World Textile Conference and the 23rd International Labor Conference. He considered himself to be incompetent and was deeply afraid that he would not be able to win. Moreover, he was tied up in affairs and could not get rid of them in fact. However, the Central Government believed that he had attended the conference last time, and that he was more familiar with the people and places, so he could no longer send secretaries and advisors to accompany him to save expenses, and he could not resign. He had to reluctantly accept his shortcomings. This trip will first go to Washington to participate in the World Textile Conference. This is the first time that our country has participated in this conference, and there are no proposals. After the meeting, he will go to Geneva to attend the 23rd International Labor Conference held on June 3. The agenda of this conference is to discuss the safety of construction workers and the reduction of working hours in the textile, printing, and chemical industries, and to revise the conventions on the minimum age of industrial and non-industrial workers. The reduction of working hours is the second stage of the two-level discussion procedure of this conference. The conference can formulate international conventions based on the replies of various countries. In European and American countries with advanced industries and overproduction, reducing working hours can indeed adjust the supply and demand of labor and relieve unemployment. Our country's industry is still in its infancy, and we need to bury our heads and step up production, so there is no such need at present. I plan to submit two proposals to the conference on the Japanese in China smuggling and factory inspection. The former not only directly affects the livelihoods of workers, but also shakes China's entire finance. The international community should have a full and correct understanding of this despicable behavior in order to promote public opinion sanctions. As for the issue of factory inspection in the concessions, the International Labor Bureau has made great efforts to mediate in the past. Although there have been many negotiations over the years, it has not been completely resolved. This matter is of great importance to the livelihood, health, well-being, and sovereignty of workers, and most of China's current industries are in the concession areas and operated by foreign capital, so the solution to this problem is extremely urgent. China is currently on the road to becoming an industrial society, and the labor issue has gradually been noticed by all parties. This is truly a gratifying phenomenon, but the suffering and status of workers are often overlooked by the general public. We believe that the construction of a new country is by no means a task that can be shouldered by a few people. In other words, in the process of production and construction, capital and labor are equally important. Only by ensuring that workers' lives are secure and economic construction can be smoothly promoted. This trip is expected to return to the country in about four days. Today, I am very grateful for the long-distance send-off from friends from all walks of life. I hope that you will give me your advice at any time to help me overcome my shortcomings.</p>

<h3>Glamorously Dressed Actress Excites Courtroom Audience</h3>
<p>Wang Caiyun Appears in Court for Car Case, Attracting Attention from General Litigants</p>
<p>In recent years, various industries in society have been experiencing an economic downturn, and the number of unemployed people is increasing daily. "Finding new ways" and "seeking sustenance" have become a common cry among the masses. However, the entertainment industry has surprisingly been blessed with unique advantages and is still developing vigorously. As a result, actors and talents are cultivated daily due to the promotion of the leisure class. Taking just the currently flourishing</p>
<p>Shanghai Opera Department</p>
<p>as an example, its variety has increased many times over the past, and the number of male and female actors is countless. Among them, there are many who have become famous and are popular for a time. For example, Wang Caiyun, a female actress who performs at venues like the New New Company, is still a middle-ranking talent, but her luxury in clothing and accessories can rival aristocratic women. If we consider those even higher up, then their</p>
<p>Extravagant Actions</p>
<p>are not difficult to imagine. Yesterday afternoon, Caiyun was sued in the First Special District Local Court by Livi Auto Company for failing to pay car repair fees and other expenses. She specially accompanied her younger brother to the court to await trial, dressed in unusually beautiful attire. She wore a light green silk cheongsam and brown leather shoes. A diamond ring adorned the middle finger of her left hand, while the middle and ring fingers of her right hand each sported a ruby and jade ring. On her left wrist was</p>
<p>A Gold Bar</p>
<p>As she stood in front of Courtroom 13 before the trial began. The location was originally a long corridor, with courtrooms on both sides. It was not exposed to sunlight all day long. Although there were two or three electric lights overhead, the light was dim. People who came here could not help but feel darkness. Now, the brilliance of Caiyun's diamonds and jewels shone into their eyes, causing the gaze of general litigants in this long alleyway to involuntarily focus on her. Caiyun had a graceful and slender figure,</p>
<p>Cheeks Dyed with Rouge</p>
<p>Under the gaze of the crowd, the peach blossoms on her cheeks became even redder. The most criticized point was a bunch of keys hanging from the button of her right rib's placket, numbering about seven or eight. These were probably the opening tools for all the chests and cabinets in her home. Now that she had to carry them with her at all times, and did not put them in her pocket, they were visibly displayed. Therefore, many who saw her said that the girl intended to show off. Soon after, the judge returned and opened the court with the clerk. Caiyun was then summoned by the bailiff to appear in court for trial. However,</p>
<p>Livi Auto Company</p>
<p>had no representative present. According to Caiyun's statement, although her car was purchased from the company, the repairs were undertaken by another company, so she did not owe the plaintiff any money. The judge then stated that because the plaintiff had not appeared, the trial could not proceed and announced that the case would be adjourned. Wang Caiyun then tightly grasped a copy of the lawsuit and a summons delivered to her by the court and slowly walked out of the courtroom with her younger brother to return home. In this shadow, fleeting like a startled swan, the sound of laughter "It's a pity that her eyes are slightly different in size" could still be heard where she passed.</p>
<h3>Record of Court Hearing on Termination of Adoption of Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Adopted Daughter Only Asks for Fifty Dollars, Hostess Ferociously Refuses, Judge Persuades Her to Give Twenty</p>
<p>Liang Xingqing, a Cantonese clerk at Shihe Jewelry Company, lives at No. 9 Wenjing Lane, Wuchang Road, Hongkou. His wife, Chen Peiqiong, also from Lingnan, is over thirty years old and is usually very strict at home. In the past, she adopted a daughter named Xiuzhen. Now the girl is nineteen years old and treats Liang and Chen like her parents, but Chen treats her like a servant. The girl could not bear it and quietly ran away last month. After Chen reported it, the Hongkou Police Station found the girl and handed her over to the court for trial. Chen was ordered to take her back, but the girl was deeply afraid of being subjected to further</p>
<p>Cruel Abuse</p>
<p>after returning, so she has not returned. Chen then hired a lawyer to submit a petition to the First Special District Local Court, requesting the termination of the adoption relationship with Xiuzhen. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji opened the court for trial. Li Xiuzhen also appeared in court with her lawyer. The girl's blue cheongsam, velvet short jacket, and leather shoes were all worn and tattered. Her short hair was disheveled, and her face was sad. She lacked the liveliness of a normal girl. According to the girl's statement,</p>
<p>Her Hometown is Suzhou</p>
<p>She was only five years old when she was adopted. Because she could not bear the abuse, she ran away on the 19th of last month and did not steal any items. She is currently living at her sworn sister's house. She asks that Chen give her fifty dollars to cover her current living expenses and does not want to return to Chen's house. Judge Xu then summoned Chen to the case and told her that what Xiuzhen was asking for was only a mere fifty dollars, which was easy to resolve. You might as well fulfill her wish and not get involved in litigation, and litigation also costs money. The woman, hearing this,</p>
<p>Absolutely Refused to Open</p>
<p>her stingy purse, repeatedly saying that she had no money. Judge Xu then persuaded her to reduce the amount to thirty yuan, but the woman still shook her head frequently. The judge then asked her, "How do you have money to hire a lawyer?" The woman said, "The lawyer is helping out." The judge said, "The lawyer is not your relative, how could he be helping out? Moreover, this kind of case has no hope of bearing fruit. This shows that you are too fierce." At this point, Chen's lawyer followed the court's instructions and repeatedly persuaded her. The woman finally</p>
<p>Yielded to Persuasion</p>
<p>and said that she was willing to pay ten yuan and would not increase it any further. Judge Xu saw that the woman was not easy to reason with and could not help but hesitate. The woman's lawyer then stated that he was willing to contribute five dollars. The judge felt that there was still room for maneuver, so he spared no effort to give the woman a final piece of advice, asking her to make up twenty yuan so that the girl could cover her short-term living expenses. The woman still tried to shirk responsibility, but eventually agreed. The clerk then drafted a reconciliation record of their separation, which was signed by the woman, the girl, and both lawyers to close the case.</p>
<h3>Wife Accused of Adultery by Her Husband Tells Her Story</h3>
<p>Driven by Livelihood, She Began Cohabiting with Another Man; Husband Was Well Aware of the Matter and Came to Collect Money from Time to Time</p>
<p>Gu Wenbao, a local resident of No. 165 Wenming Road, Nanshi, works at Yuanchanghua Firm, which specializes in selling machine oil. Ten years ago, he married Wu Wenjuan, a woman from Beiping, and they had a son who is now twelve years old. Recently, Gu suddenly reported to the Xinzha Police Station that his wife, Wu Wenjuan, was committing adultery with Xie Hongbiao, a Cantonese man, and living together at No. 80 Qingdao Road. The police station then ordered detective Ruan Yao to investigate and confirmed the facts. Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, prosecuted them under Article 239 of the Criminal Law for</p>
<p>Disrupting Family</p>
<p>The case has already been heard once by the First Special Court. Due to hopes of reconciliation, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the case was re-examined by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Second Criminal Court. After the police station lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the intention of the prosecution, Gu Wenbao testified that he had been married to Wu Wenjuan for more than ten years and had a son who was twelve years old. Several years ago, his wife suddenly ran away. After searching everywhere, he could not find any trace of her. It was not until last month that he</p>
<p>Saw Her on the Street</p>
<p>He then secretly followed her and saw his wife enter No. 80 Qingdao Road. He then secretly reported to the police station, etc. Wu Wenjuan stated that she was thirty-two years old, from Beiping, and had been living with Xie Hongbiao for five years. They had a child who was four years old. Her husband was fully aware of her relationship with Xie. After she married Gu Wenbao, Gu did not engage in proper work and did not provide for her. She then became a female employee at Huacheng Tobacco Company. Later, when the business closed, she was forced by livelihood to</p>
<p>Disregard Shame</p>
<p>and became a hostess at Wang Laoer's Yu Shu Zhai in Renmin Heli. At that time, her husband was fully aware of it. She had even asked her husband how to handle it if there were customers. Her husband replied that as long as she gave him money, she could do as she pleased. From then on, her husband came to collect money from time to time, usually three to five yuan at a time. She still maintained her husband's face, and if she encountered customers, she would claim that her husband was a relative. Finally, unable to bear the suffering, she resolutely filed a</p>
<p>Divorce Lawsuit</p>
<p>with the Shanghai Local Court in 1931. Because the conditions were not met, she was sued. When she was at the bookstore, she met Xie Hongbiao, a customer, who learned of her pitiful life. Unable to bear it, he lived with her to maintain her life, which has been five years. Her husband was also fully aware of it. In these years, her husband often waited for her at the small vegetable market to borrow money, or even went to No. 80 Qingdao Road. Because she and Xie lived upstairs, her husband</p>
<p>Dared Not to Go Upstairs</p>
<p>he asked Chen Zhang, a tenant woman, about Xie's whereabouts. If he had gone out, he would ask the woman upstairs to come down. When she came downstairs, she would give him several yuan. Today, Chen Zhang has also come to court, etc. Xie Hongbiao then confessed that he lived with Wu Wenjuan, but did not know that she was a married woman. Chen Zhang, a witness woman, proved that Gu Wenbao had indeed come and asked her to invite Wu Wenjuan</p>
<p>Downstairs to Talk</p>
<p>However, she did not know about the matter of borrowing money. Finally, Gu Wenbao stated that Wu Wenjuan's statements were all false. Since Wu ran away, he had never met her and had never borrowed money from her. During the postponement of the hearing, she had asked him to settle out of court for one thousand yuan, but he refused. He requested a severe sentence. Judge Zhan stated that the case still needed to be investigated and postponed the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>The Species is Fierce and Untamed</p>
<p>Currently Temporarily Housed Near the Silk Factory</p>
<p>The black panther purchased by the Municipal Zoo from New Zealand arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. The zoo is currently building a strong iron cage for display. The panther's body is short, small, and powerful, about four feet long and one and a half feet tall. Its fur is black and shiny with colorful spots. It is currently temporarily housed on a pile of sand in a giant fish tank, as it is extremely fierce and untamed. The cage is made of iron bars and wrapped in iron sheets, so it is not easy to see it without permission. The zoo will soon build a strong cage for display to the public. One of the cages originally used to house kangaroos will be reinforced with iron bars and the interior decorated. It is expected to be completed soon. The exact date of formal display has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Finally, as a result of studying the truth of modern politics, we have fully explained that modern politics has four major trends:</p>
<p>A. From multiple parties to one party;</p>
<p>B. From separation of powers to centralization of powers;</p>
<p>C. From deliberation to dictatorship;</p>
<p>D. From emphasizing the rule of law to emphasizing the rule of people.</p>
<p>These four major trends are issues worthy of study in today's politics. To study today's Chinese politics, we must of course study today's world politics; because in this 20th century, politics, military affairs, and economics are all affected by the world. Therefore, we must study today's world politics before we can study today's Chinese politics. Speaking of this, I can't help but recall Mussolini's criticism of the politics of the founding country of modern democratic politics - the United States. Mussolini said: "Today's United States is a country without politics, because the American people are people without political concepts. Because they only discuss the issue of drinking beer or not drinking beer once every four years. Do these people still have political concepts, political thoughts, and political actions?" We cannot be sure whether Mussolini's words are correct; but let's think about it: the political concept of the people of a country is indeed weak when they only discuss the issue of whether to drink beer once every four years. But when we turn around and look at China, China's situation may be even worse than the United States, because they can still discuss their own pressing issues once every four years, but most of our people don't even know how to discuss - they don't even know what politics is, what is there to discuss? I think: past Chinese politics - maybe even to this day - only has two things: ㊀ want the people's money; ㊁ beat the people's butts. What other relationship is there besides this? It is truly heartbreaking to say! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>After Years of Togetherness, a Sudden Parting: Mother, Daughter, and Sisters Embrace and Weep</h3>
<p>Four Conditions Agreed Upon in Court: Severing Family Ties Hereafter</p>
<p>Ms. Shi Xiangyun, a renowned performer of Shanghai-style opera and local resident, is skilled in performing arts at various entertainment venues in this city, as well as excelling in Kunqu opera, enjoying considerable fame. She resides at No. 46, Tongkang Li, opposite the Slaughterhouse Company on Chujia Bridge in the French Concession, a property she owns. Her brother, Shi Qingtang, stage name Xiao Yun, performs Shanghai-style opera. The siblings each have their own distinct style. Qingtang and Wu Lanying collaborate and broadcast on major radio stations in this city. Their father, Shi Xikang, had taken Ms. Leng Feixia from Sichuan as a concubine when he was in Hankou.</p>
<p>She also learned Shanghai-style opera</p>
<p>And performed with Xiangyun and others. She gave birth to a daughter named Lan Shi, who is fourteen years old this year. Xikang passed away last spring. Feixia and her daughter continued to live with Qingtang, Xiangyun, and others. However, after her husband's death, Feixia suddenly became pregnant. In January of this year, she gave birth to twins, both boys, at the China-Germany Maternity Hospital. Both infants were not viable and died shortly after birth. After being discharged from the hospital, Feixia took her</p>
<p>daughter Lan Bao</p>
<p>And rented a place at No. 47, Fuzhi Fang, Beile Road. Shi Qingtang, considering that his father's concubine, Shi Leng Feixia, had behaved improperly by becoming pregnant and giving birth after his death, thereby disgracing the family, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Leng Feixia in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court, seeking to sever their relationship. The defendant, Leng Feixia, also hired a lawyer to file a defense and a counterclaim demanding property division. The case was heard twice and then</p>
<p>adjourned for out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Details of these events have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Wu Xiaoke continued the hearing in Civil Division Six. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the case had been settled out of court through the representatives. They requested the court to draw up a settlement record. Each party added one additional person as a party to the agreement. The plaintiff added Shi Xiangyun, and the defendant added Shi Lanbao. They agreed on</p>
<p>four conditions:</p>
<p>㊀ Shi Qingtang and Shi Xiangyun will pay the defendants, Shi Leng Feixia and Shi Lanbao, 2,700 yuan for alimony and education expenses. ㊁ The jewelry and property in the safe deposit box at the Four Banks Savings Society previously held by Xikang will no longer be claimed by the defendants. ㊂ After the settlement, Leng Feixia will sever her family relationship with the plaintiffs. ㊃ Lanbao will remain under the guardianship and care of Feixia. The court verified the terms and ordered Feixia to act as Lanbao's legal guardian. The court clerk was instructed to prepare the</p>
<p>settlement record.</p>
<p>The parties and their lawyers signed the record, and the court declared the settlement to be legally binding and adjourned. Shi Lanbao, who had lived with her older sister Xiangyun for many years, was deeply saddened by the sudden separation. Tears streamed down her face. Xiangyun and Feixia, witnessing the scene, could not bear it and embraced each other, weeping with reluctance. They were eventually persuaded by those present and left with tears in their eyes.</p>

<h3>The Head Shopkeeper</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>He was very fat, probably requiring two ordinary people plus several dozen pounds of meat to match his size. His face was the color of purple sugar, extremely full and solid. His voice was exceedingly loud. A simple yawn could startle your ears. His surname was Zhou, but no one ever mentioned it, simply calling him "Head Shopkeeper," both because of his large size and because he ran a large general store.</p>
<p>When calling for a rickshaw, the puller would glance at him and then at the vehicle, worriedly saying:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it can't hold you?"</p>
<p>He would climb aboard while saying:</p>
<p>"It's alright, I'll sit sideways."</p>
<p>The puller, having no choice, would then ask for more money, to which he would grunt vaguely in agreement. But upon reaching the destination, he wouldn't add a single coin, instead placing his hands behind his back, sticking out his belly, tilting his head, and saying as he walked off:</p>
<p>"You say you're tired? Hmph, I didn't have a pleasant ride either! What suffering, what suffering!"</p>
<p>Upon returning from the streets, he would invariably bellow:</p>
<p>"Bring me something to eat!"</p>
<p>A withered old maid would silently bring him a bowl of braised beef. He would devour it greedily, all the while cursing himself.</p>
<p>"Damn, the poorer I am, the hungrier I get!"</p>
<p>In reality, he was far from poor, owning not only the general store but also several pawnshops. Moreover, the president of the Chamber of Commerce would always remember him when raising funds for the authorities. After his snack, he would shout:</p>
<p>"Where's today's newspaper?"</p>
<p>If no one brought it to him, he wouldn't get angry. He already read the newspaper first thing in the morning, scanning important news such as the rise and fall of grain prices, and was merely using it for leisure at this point. He would read provincial news, national news, and even incomprehensible foreign news, but his criticism after reading was always the same:</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>Or, he would doze off over the newspaper before finishing it, his nose practically touching the newsprint.</p>
<p>In the general store, his favorite place to sit was between the accountant and the wooden cash counter. The clerks, knowing his habits, would place the extra-large chair made especially for him there. He wasn't there to supervise the accounts or personally manage the money, but because he enjoyed listening to the clerks dropping coins into the cash counter, the sudden clattering sound, and the sound of them telling the accountant things like "Five yuan, change three corners." According to him, this was more interesting than going to the theater to hear men sing in women's voices.</p>
<p>As for banquets for raising funds and the like, he was even less willing to attend. If he was questioned about it later, he would pat his rear and laughingly defend himself:</p>
<p>"What would I do there? ... You don't have a chair for me to sit on!"</p>
<p>He believed that everything in life was fake, and only money earned and held in hand was truly real. But at the age of thirty-five, he suddenly wanted children and took a concubine, but she didn't conceive. At thirty-seven, he took another, but still no children. What was the problem? He couldn't figure it out. Upon turning forty, he grew anxious and finally turned to the gods. Every year in June, when the City God went on procession, he volunteered to help, wiping sweat from his brow while supporting the City God's palanquin through the streets. Because, according to legend, this could indeed produce sons and was a good deed that only required effort and didn't cost much money.</p>
<p>After that, he also engaged in charitable activities. He donated a few dollars to the Red Cross in the provincial capital, buying a badge as a regular member, which he hung on his coat with toothpicks and the like. But when officials from the association came to raise money for medical expenses for wounded soldiers, he angrily cursed:</p>
<p>"Who told them to fight! They're such fools!"</p>
<p>Then, he would become amiable again, speaking a great deal of unimportant words to dismiss the fundraising effort. If the fundraiser was still not sensible enough to leave, he would personally bring out tea, ham, and other items, warmly pointing out to the fundraiser:</p>
<p>"These are top-quality goods, take a sniff, very fragrant! Other stores wouldn't give you this kind. ... Buy some, the price is fair, surely we wouldn't try to profit from an acquaintance?"</p>
<p>The monks in charge of the various temples, knowing that he wanted children, took the opportunity to offer methods. He had previously disliked these people, but now he accepted them very humbly. Because he understood that this was like doing business, requiring multiple calculations. Supporting the City God alone was not enough, but no matter what good methods the monks suggested, it always came down to giving money to the bodhisattvas, such as gilding the large Buddha or buying oil for sky lanterns. What did the head shopkeeper do? He frowned, thought for a moment, and then generously said:</p>
<p>"Bring me the donation book!"</p>
<p>The monks asked him to write himself, but he revealed his thick, strong wrists and declined:</p>
<p>"Look, how can I do that? My writing is shaky, am I supposed to draw snakes?"</p>
<p>The monks asked him how much he was willing to donate, and he strutted his square steps and said generously:</p>
<p>"Whatever you like!"</p>
<p>The monks dared not write too much, only writing fifty days' worth for him. When they asked him to pay, he would walk up to them, pat them lightly, and say as if in private:</p>
<p>"You're so clueless! Old master. How have you lived this long? Does this still require me to pay money? I'm telling you, my name is worth money. You take it and solicit donations now. When people see that I, the Head Shopkeeper, have donated, they'll know it's a very good thing, who wouldn't donate? ... Heh heh, it's not easy to give people my name!"</p>
<p>The burst of laughter at the end would make the other party shudder.</p>
<p>In remote provinces, things are most baffling. When the army needs to move, they tell the people to raise departure fees; when they need to fight, they tell the people to contribute war funds. Therefore, the president of the Chamber of Commerce handed the Head Shopkeeper a slip of paper, saying that he owed twenty yuan. He crumpled the slip of paper into a ball in front of him, almost yelling:</p>
<p>"Hmph, I ask you, what exactly do you do? We elected you to be the president! Not a robber!"</p>
<p>But the president was an old fox and didn't get angry, instead using words to persuade him. He also understood that he couldn't close the store just for twenty yuan, and raising the prices of all goods in the city to recoup the loss would be very easy, so he exceptionally dipped into his own pocket, but was still furious, cursing everyone he met:</p>
<p>"Damn, what's the point of doing this business? It's better to close shop!"</p>
<p>Neighbors on the street had always called him "Head Shopkeeper" to his face, but behind his back they jokingly called him "Big Fatty" or "Meat Archway." Such ridicule about his name was ultimately harmless to him, but when the news of the twenty-yuan donation spread, the new nickname they gave him fully displayed their malice. That was to call him "Soft Edge." "Soft Edge" refers to a turtle, and they believed that it was impossible to get him to move by coaxing. As long as you stepped on its back, it would crawl. Sometimes they didn't call him "Soft Edge," and simply called him "Step On and Crawl." Such situations also happened.</p>
<h3>Father's Hair</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>Having reached my early twenties, not only unable to support a "family" but also spending almost my entire life in worry, I can't help but stare blankly at the trivial things I hear from home.</p>
<p>I don't like to hear people pour out their loneliness, nor do I like to pour out my loneliness to others. But when I discovered that all the joy and hope were too far away from me from some sincere emotions, looking back at myself, I felt truly lonely. We grow up in loneliness: without joy, without hope, only a set of shackles of life grinding us non-stop.</p>
<p>I discovered an even better example, I saw my father's hair, which had been lonely all his life, had turned completely white.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I remembered that his hair was not yet completely white. Once, during a ancestral worship ceremony, when my father bent down to worship, his hair was lifted by a breeze (his hair was a kind of long hair combed backwards after his braid was cut off), and I began to see that what was shining on his head was not black, but silver-like half-white hair, occupying about three-tenths of it. I couldn't help but be silently surprised:</p>
<p>"Ah! Has it become so fast?"</p>
<p>My father, who used to hold my hand and comfort me in many ways to go to school when I was young, was still healthy at that time. Once he held me and lifted his hair - it was completely black, and white hairs were almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>Only fourteen or fifteen years apart, his hair had changed from black to white. In the meantime, we seemed to have not noticed how it turned white - and what flashed before my eyes was a question, what did he do during these years?</p>
<p>Recently, I have occasionally found one or two white hairs in the hair I combed down, and when I held them and looked at them carefully, a little helpless and desolate sorrow arose in my heart.</p>
<p>Here, I also realized the loneliness of our lives from the growth of white hair.</p>
<p>Returning home, in the dawn of the second day, I had such a feeling: in a daze, I habitually heard my father and mother talking about trivial matters at home, from where the money would come from that day to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and I habitually dreaded listening to these things. However, I had to endure it even if I dreaded listening to it. The sandy voice, with the secondary stress and trembling, relentlessly bombarded my eardrums; it was my father.</p>
<p>"When you get old, you may become a bit talkative!"</p>
<p>I thought. When you get old, you do talk more than others. When my father was in his prime, he was decisive, resolute, and silent, and he never cared about trivial matters at home.</p>
<p>I didn't want to listen to this voice, and with a sighing mood, I buried my head in the quilt.</p>
<p>However, after a while - old, old... the voice shook my heart, and when I poked my head out of the quilt again, I saw half of a hunched figure outside the unfastened window curtains - and his white hair happened to be very clear for me to see.</p>
<p>"Heh heh, so early in the morning, are you pruning the flower trees again?"</p>
<p>As usual, he panted for a while, straightened his back, and bent down again. Half of his life's work was swallowed up by old age, and now he can only entrust his labor to flowers and plants. In the morning sun, I saw his hair trembling in the light into a mess of hemp threads!</p>
<p>So I realized again the reason why white hair climbs onto people's heads. By then, we will still be lonely, and our hair will still turn completely white! Now we have so little that we can't find it.</p>

<h3>That Strange Person</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>I was very lucky to have met a very strange little train station master. The train station was pitifully small, like a small temple in the corner of a mountain. The first time I saw him was in the winter when it was snowing and raining. He was sitting in the ticket office, his feet resting on a small table. Next to his soaked leather shoes were a bag of peanuts and a bowl of warm yellow wine. The coal stove crackled, and white smoke like spider silk emerged from the crevices. He scolded the peasants who bought tickets. Now there was no one in front of him, so he dozed off in front of the stove. The tenth time I met him, he was still like that...</p>
<p>Constant drool dripped onto the dirty, shiny stain on his uniform. In spring and summer, he would move the sofa to the open space behind the station, where he would sleep all day. In winter - when the wind blew, he would hide in the ticket office and not move at all, drinking yellow wine and waiting for those peasants he thought were both stupid and stingy to come and be scolded.</p>
<p>Now it was winter again, snowing and raining, still in that ticket office. The station bell didn't ring at all. He aimlessly patrolled the room, his ticket machine, and that open window hole with no ghosts in sight, and the hats, thermometers, fire extinguishers, red and green signal flags, and various large and small forms and notices hanging on the wall - all of which were exceptionally familiar and seemed to be of no use at all.</p>
<p>"Okay... but what are you standing here for?"</p>
<p>He patted the red-painted fire extinguisher that hadn't been moved in ten years, as if patting the shoulder of an old friend, and then made a face at the neat, round wall clock like a mischievous child.</p>
<p>The first Sunday of January - but the calendar showed the previous Tuesday... The station master himself knew the year, month, and any day of the week, and never made a mistake, so he was extremely indifferent to things like calendars, just as he knew what his subordinates - clerks, switchmen, porters - did at what time and where their shortcomings lay. ... But now it stopped the station master in his tracks.</p>
<p>This physically strong middle-aged man moistened two of his fingers and started to tear off those calendar pages wolfishly - he sang obscene songs and groaned for no reason, just like he was taking off a woman's clothes.</p>
<p>"That's right - it's Sunday!"</p>
<p>He muttered to himself... "If I treat today as Saturday... do something wrong - that would be so fun!" He took out a toothpick and held it deeply in his mouth, walked to the ticket window, leaned over, and looked outside. The path from the front of the station to the back was damp and lonely. Straw sandals and rubber-soled shoes sparsely imprinted mud marks on it. There were no people or animals - no shadows at all.</p>
<p>I walked behind him - I pushed open the door, there was no sound at all... He had been sticking his face to the window hole for thirty minutes. "Station Master, is the next train coming soon?" He ignored me and continued to stare blankly at the wet path outside.</p>
<p>Every Sunday, when the first train arrived here, a middle school principal named Lin would pass in front of him and simply greet him, "How are you, Station Master?" - It was the station master's only and greatest joy of the week. Today - Sunday, that middle school principal named Lin hadn't come until four o'clock in the afternoon. He had been waiting for him... not knowing at all what I had said to him.</p>
<p>Yes, every Sunday he would block that small ticket window with his strong face... Sometimes others didn't know what he was waiting for...</p>
<h3>Grief Beyond Playfulness</h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>(Reading Notes)</p>
<p>The famous reportage writer Egon Erwin Kisch said: "The places and phenomena described by the reportage writer, the experiences he tries, the history he proves, and the sources he explores do not necessarily have to be distant, rare, or difficult for people to approach. In a world that always wants to hide the truth and therefore always finds lies, our writers only need to be able to grasp their subjects. There is nothing more strange than simple truth, nothing richer in exotic scenery than our surroundings, and nothing more beautiful than objective phenomena."</p>
<p>These are words of wisdom, the best lesson for the authors of reportage. After reading Mr. Lu Xiliang's preliminary selection in the eighth issue of Zhongliu, I became even more convinced of the truth of these words.</p>
<p>Kisch once wrote twenty-three segments about our affairs, forming a secret China, which was widely circulated by people who love the truth. However, here, in this ancient country, every day someone is creating lies, covering ugliness with brocade, and decorating chaos with tranquility, so that people cannot see the truth. She has even more secrets, and the author of the preliminary selection has discovered one of these secrets.</p>
<p>The author, using the tone of a township head, tells the story of a preliminary election in a certain county. The vote-buying runners actively woo the township heads. Money, wine, food, positions, gifts, all methods are used, and the township heads have also decided on the people they want to elect. Everything is settled, but when it comes to the election, a clerk from the county government and a soldier escort them to the county magistrate in the Wen Miao Hall. Unexpectedly, the county magistrate glared and said:</p>
<p>"The provincial government issued a secret order last night, asking me to do this! I also think it's inappropriate for you to elect randomly; it's difficult to count the votes and easy to cause disputes. Now we'll follow the provincial government's method, but let me tell you first: the people I've written down are all highly respected in your county. Whoever opposes them is a troublemaker. I won't be polite to troublemakers."</p>
<p>After saying that, the county magistrate wrote four names on the blackboard: the nephew of the military governor, Yang ××, the younger brother of the military commander, Jiang ××, the former county magistrate, You ××, and one who was "neither rich, nor powerful, nor qualified," the peasant Lao Wu. This was to be a puppet, a signboard of justice and fairness. Afterward, he gave instructions before leaving:</p>
<p>"I'm telling you: when you go out, whoever is bribed will be considered to have coveted the bribe; the briber will be considered to have deliberately bribed. Take them to the district together, no discussion, I'll give them one beating and two fines."</p>
<p>"After leaving the election place, the vote-buying runners thought they had fulfilled their agreement and pulled them around to invite them to dinner. But these township heads, intimidated by the county magistrate's instructions and ashamed of breaking their promise, had no choice but to run away."</p>
<p>This story is realistic, and in China, it is still quite remarkable, but the author is able to use a satirical tone to describe it calmly, yet passionately, so that people can feel the power of his pen. This power makes you laugh, but before you can laugh out loud, it immediately makes you serious. This is because what is contained in the author's heart is not playfulness, but grief beyond playfulness. Although the author's name seems unfamiliar, such skilled technique, simple and moving style, is rare in so-called reportage.</p>
<p>However, I think that the last paragraph, writing about the awakening of these township heads, is good, but it is not harmonious with the whole article. The author did not explain Lao Han's background clearly. This character, sandwiched between the peasants, actually said, "...We have the masses, and the masses are power. As long as we lead them, saving the country and the nation will be no problem!" This is somewhat inappropriate. Moreover, the standards that the township heads themselves wanted to elect were not very bright in the first place. Let's look at the self-description of the township head written in the first person:</p>
<p>Initially, I decided on two people on my ballot. One was Principal Wen, who was a friend of my father. His banquets and gifts were more substantial than others. One was Section Chief He, who was a leader in the education field. I wanted to recommend a few primary school teachers to him in the future. I couldn't decide on the other two. It so happened that it was our family's turn to provide a trainee. My younger brother had just graduated from elementary school, how could my father let him be trained? But it was unavoidable. I had to ask Regiment Commander Chen to talk to the chief of the joint village association and tell him not to train or hire someone to be trained. Because hiring someone, you have to give them eight mu of land to settle down! Sure enough, Regiment Commander Chen said it would be fine with just one word. His expression to me was: as long as I voted for him, it would be a thank you. How could I not write his name on my vote, which didn't cost me money! My younger brother was wholeheartedly trying to pass the teacher training institute. The director had clearly said to people: "This time we will select students by vote." My brother's request could not be refused. And the director also agreed to replace my bicycle's tire, so I decided on him again.</p>
<p>A dozen of us coincided. - Of course, they all got their benefits. -</p>
<p>The county magistrate raped public opinion. These township heads realized that they had been sold out, but they didn't realize that they had actually sold themselves out long ago. This state is far from being awakened, and it is inappropriate to write them as a group of "hot-headed" awakened masses.</p>
<p>But apart from that, The Preliminary Selection is still a very good article, especially today - when even the progressive creators are "writing doggerel," it has a serious meaning.</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Women</h3>
<p>— Shuangfei</p>
<p>"The Third Kind of Person" is a way of dividing men into three types; now I divide women into two types:</p>
<p>One type of woman has a rosy complexion, a full figure, and often feels cheerful. This type of woman is called a "healthy and beautiful woman," and they are very capable of participating in society. The other type of woman has a sallow complexion, a thin figure, and often feels depressed. This type of woman is called a "Lin Daiyu-esque woman," and they are relegated to a backward position in society!</p>
<p>The difference between these two types of women is naturally dictated by their environment. Healthy and beautiful women have been cleansed by the new era, so their physique can become strong and healthy. "Lin Daiyu-esque women," on the other hand, are still bound by feudalism, so their physique is weak, even leading to various physiological ailments! Apart from deep sympathy for these women, we hope they can improve their living conditions. If their illness is caused by physical weakness and blood deficiency, we would like to introduce several miraculous women's medicines: "Monthly Red" for promoting menstruation and blood circulation, and "Women's Treasure" for nourishing blood and regulating menstruation. Proper treatment can also cure the disease—Qiangren.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Farce</h3>
<p>— Tianyu</p>
<p>Japan's new Foreign Minister Mr. Sato, gave a wonderful "equal diplomacy" declaration towards China at the beginning of his tenure, stating that Japan's past mistakes of dealing with China everywhere with a special status, and in the future, it should seek a compromise with China in the spirit of equality. This bold declaration, which had never been heard since the "September 18th Incident," immediately won huge applause from peace lovers at home and abroad. As a result, some of us also thought that Japan's policy had really "turned a corner." However, the reality is not so easy. It seems that after making a bold declaration, Mr. Sato was not so bold after all, or perhaps the voices of opponents had already subtly risen, so within two or three days after the declaration was issued, he successively issued many supplementary explanations. In these supplementary explanations, he emphasized that Japan's national policy has been consistent and has not "turned a corner," and that only the method has changed. We can see that after making a bold declaration, Mr. Sato was quickly trying to gradually take it back. However, despite Sato's keen observation of the situation, and his efforts to dilute the peaceful colors of his declaration to suit the tastes of his opponents, a wave of opposition to his declaration was still spreading uncontrollably. As a result, just four or five days after the declaration was issued, a wave of dissatisfaction arose, and the last sentence was: "Misunderstanding of the situation"! The next request was: the Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister should resign together. Sato, who was listening to a lot of applause at home and abroad, was in high spirits, but he was suddenly splashed with a bucket of cold water; and many listeners at home and abroad, whose enthusiastic applause had not yet ended, were followed by a chilling wind, leaving everyone stunned. Such a farcical tragicomedy in the international arena is truly worthy of sighing "it is the limit."</p>
<p>However, this incident is the best lesson for us.</p>
<p>In the past, some of us always believed that people would "return to their senses" one day, which is called "awakening." As the saying goes: "If I always treat people with sincerity, people will eventually treat me with sincerity," which is what it means. However, in fact, a huge national institution, unless it is equal to a machine, can be controlled at will, stopped and started at will. A national institution is not so easy. May I ask: Since the Meiji Restoration of our friendly country, its prosperity has been fundamentally built on military victories abroad. Today, military victories are even more rapid, and it has gained vast lands without any effort. Where can you find such a bargain today? In such a smooth situation where the military chariot is surpassing ancient and modern times, is it actually possible to stop it midway, pat it on the shoulder and say: "Take a break!" Moreover, in today's situation, unless it suddenly encounters a huge obstacle in front, preventing it from advancing at all, and it is forced by the situation to suffer from the pain of wanting to stop but being unable to, let alone when there is no obstacle in front, and it is going very smoothly? Therefore, regarding Sato's farcical tragicomedy, we ourselves can take the opportunity to thoroughly "awaken" and see that unless we quickly throw a bomb at the oncoming chariot, or fire a cannon at it, the chariot will never suddenly stop in front of us midway, and even "stop for a moment" is impossible! Even Sato's "empty promises" speech cannot exist, let alone anything else!</p>
<h3>The Temple of the God of Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>The "Temple of the God of Agriculture" used to be a "forbidden area," used by emperors with the dignity of the ninth five-year plan to perform agricultural ceremonies. Therefore, in the main hall of worship, various agricultural tools were displayed. During the ceremony, it is said that these agricultural tools were "used by the emperor" once every year. The altar site is quite large. There used to be a high wall around it to prevent miscellaneous people from setting foot in it. What happened later? Obstacles like city walls were removed without leaving any trace. This achievement is indeed not small. Whether you are from the north, from the so-called prosperous and somewhat mysterious "Fragrant Factory," or from the west, passing through the "Jiangnan City God Temple" and rushing to the bridge, you can no longer circle along the foot of the wall, and you can directly pass through the forbidden altar.</p>
<p>Then, it became a park, and a few copper coins could give you a good view. The towering pines and cypresses tightly covered the pedestrian path with their branches and leaves, preventing the poisonous face of the sun from hurting the skin of tourists. As soon as you enter the "Second Altar Gate," a cool and fresh breath hits your nose, and your tired mood is also invigorated. We didn't have the eye for what this forbidden area looked like in the past, so we can't know, but the facilities at this time are probably not left over from the past.</p>
<p>Following the uneven tree trunks, there are large "tea sheds" in the dense places, with white tablecloths and rattan armchairs, neatly waiting for ordinary guests. If you have a few cents on you, you might as well sit down. If you are hungry, there are also snacks. Do you want to exercise? There are Earths and other things that you can use to exercise your body. If you want to find a woman to talk to, it's not difficult. Just watch carefully as the women in business slowly stroll through the trees, and when their eyes glance into the tea shed, don't miss this opportunity, go up and strike up a conversation, and then you will easily succeed. If all of this is not for you, if you want to relax your muscles and bones, well, believe your steps and stay in the flower garden for a while. In front of you are unknown miscellaneous flowers and plants, and patterns that have been carefully arranged; look at the rare birds, peacocks, macaques, etc. in the wire cages, and you will also feel a little relaxed.</p>
<p>Entering the third altar gate, there are two "altars" on the left and right of the main path, for some playthings related to heaven, earth, and the five elements that cannot be explained, stone-carved landscapes and "pointing instruments" are placed in a certain direction according to regulations. The dragon-shaped coiled pine lowers its branches into a "dragon claw," almost touching people's heads, and the strong vines climb to the top, winding around like snakes. Climbing to the high altar, the city head of Yongdingmen extends over the embrasure and embraces the outer perimeter of the three altar walls. If it is a windy and cold night, if it is in the deep of the night when there is no one around, the branches and leaves rustle on all sides, and under the dragon-shaped snake-like pine vines, it seems that there are ghosts and monsters, and the city walls silently reveal their terrible teeth like giant demons, and you will feel chills down your spine.</p>
<p>Once, brilliant flowers bloomed here, the "Fragrant Factory" was opened as an amusement market, the girls in the hutongs moved their fragrant nests to new houses built nearby, and the gongs and drums of the amusement center in the south of the city attracted tourists from all over the world. Not far away, there was the "Tianqiao," and every day, groups of people would occupy the tea sheds in the altar so much that they were not enough to distribute!</p>
<p>After that, the fragrant nests were changed to municipal houses, the places to eat and drink were moved to the central area, and the amusement centers that attracted tourists stopped breathing under the strain of tension. At this point, the Temple of the God of Agriculture became desolate.</p>
<p>Originally, this place was close to the south of the city, and it was usually quite remote. Apart from the few streets of the Fragrant Factory, there were few residents nearby. The hot weather was fine, but once it entered autumn, the coldness of the north was quite early. When the autumn wind stirred up the yellow sand on the ground, there were pitifully few tourists in the altar. After the lights were turned on, except for the occasional peddler passing through here, there were almost no pedestrians. At this point, the rumor experts who feared that the world would not be in chaos revealed a message, saying that ghosts and goblins often appeared in this place, with vivid descriptions, which could make people's hair stand on end. Because of this, the fate of the altar was deeply buried by a terrible atmosphere!</p>
<p>In the silent night, I dreamed of the magnificent agricultural altar that had been used by the emperor. Now, the old capital is cast in dim twilight. I haven't seen it for several years, and I'm afraid it has sunk even lower.</p>
<h3>Reflections on Reading Advertisements</h3>
<p>— Zhuoren</p>
<p>Recently, a certain dance hall published a huge advertisement for the replacement of the ××× band to attract "dance fans," but the next day, the ××× dance hall also published an advertisement saying: "The band in this hall has never changed a single person. Someone is using our name to deceive people. We hereby solemnly declare." This kind of advertisement war in the style of "Zhang Xiaoquan's original old store" is already common in Shanghai. However, I am not a "dance fan." Whether it is the "original old store" or "selling dog meat under a sheep's head," I thought of "commercial ethics" because of it.</p>
<p>Doing business is "seeking profit with capital," and it seems excusable to say that your own things are a little better. Except for those who sell bitter gourds, there are no advertisements in the world that don't say "good." However, the best scissors may not be produced by Zhang Xiaoquan, and the pigs slaughtered by Lu Gaojian are also ordinary pigs. However, it seems that opening a scissors store must rely on Zhang Xiaoquan to attract customers, and selling meat must hang a Lu Gaojian sign, or it would be unfair to the "eaters." As a result, people don't know what to do, and even if there are scissors more sharp than Zhang Xiaoquan, and pork more delicious than Lu Gaojian, they are all swept away.</p>
<p>When I read "Commercial English" in the past, I read a very good example: A new barber shop opened across from a barber shop. A customer asked the boss, "How's business?" The boss smiled and replied: "Those who come to our shop are all "upper class people." They only do the business of "peddlers and servants."</p>
<p>He did not focus on the luxurious decoration, comfortable seats, attentive service, and excellent technicians of the "trade," but simply compared "upper class people" with "peddlers and servants." Who would be willing to not be an "upper class person" and be a "peddler and servant"? — This is a very effective advertising technique.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lu Xun passed away, pirated books were everywhere on the market. I bought a pirated "Miscellaneous Essays Collection" for two dimes and eight cents, which was originally priced at four yuan with a 17% discount. However, when I turned to the last page, I saw the eight characters "Copyright Reserved, Reproduction Prohibited." Perhaps the book dealer is a little more clever than other businessmen, and came up with that kind of "dead people can't testify" "humor."</p>
<p>However, the ethics of merchants have been lost!</p>
<h3>Refugee Ship</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>The boundless gray mist swept away the last rays of the setting sun. The evening on the sea seemed so bleak and desolate.</p>
<p>The wind kept blowing on the bugle, churning in the sky. The sea tide was like a naughty child, constantly bouncing, jumping, rejoicing and singing; but it was also like an ambitious politician, vying for superiority and seizing territory: constantly shouting, killing and clamoring.</p>
<p>A lone boat stood precariously, pushed by the waves, constantly overturning and swaying: hundreds of homeless wanderers traveled day and night. Whether they were frail old people, ignorant children, or young and strong people, their hearts were equally cold and desolate. Looking forward, the endless sea and sky, the endless vastness! Looking back, the faces of fierce gods were hung in their hometowns.</p>
<p>The shadow of death hung over everyone's minds. They were not like poets, unable to utter the desolation of the sea at dusk, nor could they sing the poem "The Lone Duck Flies with the Setting Sun." For everything, they only had terror and hatred. They tried to rush up to the sky and crush the sun into powder; because they really hated its poisonous cruelty - the drought tore up the source of their lives: the crops withered into yellow grass, and the seeds rotted together with the scorched mud; the ground cracked into a turtle's back, and even the ancient wells that had been around for thousands of years saw the bottom. The poisonous sun forced everyone to dig up grass roots, peel tree bark, and even eat the flesh of dead people!</p>
<p>The tragic cries under the disaster were indeed like the clamor of the waves.</p>
<p>These waves, this sea, also made them hate and angry; and smeared with extremely strong terror. It was a great harvest year after the drought, and the bitter faces had just regained a little smile; the hope that had been away from them for a long time had also regained a little vitality. But the water, the boundless giant waves, washed away the dikes of the countryside, washed away the safety of their lives: swallowed the lives and property of many people and animals, forcing them to leave the birthplace where their ancestors lived, and step into the vastness.</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>on the wandering journey, passing through a village, a township, and another county town.</p>
<p>Everyone crossed high mountains, traversed steep ridges, and also crossed winding waters; circled for thousands of miles. It has a little more mobility than the nomadic people. There has not been a peaceful sleep all year round, sweet dreams and reveries have long left them far away, only wandering and famine, hovering beside them all day long.</p>
<p>Wherever they went, they rarely received sympathy and help; they were not allowed to stay for a little longer. It seemed that the world could not tolerate this group of "redundant people." Some busybodies were even more fond of creating many slanderous rumors against them: "The Yellow River Woman" can use closing-eye magic and can draw talismans and chant spells, stealing things without you noticing for a while... They were born with this cheap look, and begging is an ancestral profession; everyone must endure several years of wandering suffering to live peacefully to old age; in their hometowns, they still have whole houses and whole pieces of land...</p>
<p>In this way, the general public became more defensive and hostile towards them, cursing and resenting them. In order to maintain local "peace," they often suffered the treatment of being "escorted" out of the country - adding infinite embarrassment and pain to the lives of those who were displaced and suffering!</p>
<p>Forced off the land and onto the sea, in the vast sea, they did not know where they would set sail?</p>
<p>No one could maintain their mental balance, no one could see their own life clearly, and no one could estimate what life would be like tomorrow? No one in the group knew who would die next?</p>
<p>The night at sea was getting deeper step by step. Under the shroud of dim and miserable fog and the constant attack of waves; the memory of the flood rushing into the village stirred up in everyone's hearts again; this tragic memory made them tremble in terror. Often, because of the overturning and shaking of the ship, it would cause a great, miserable, desperate cry and shout, a request and a prayer - although they were assigned to be "redundant people" in the world, they all cherished their lives very much; they leaned on each other and took care of each other among their companions; people who used to be strangers living in different places have now become closer than their own siblings.</p>
<p>Although they also gave birth on the long journey, it was far from being able to withstand death: the large group of three to four hundred people was left with only a hundred lives - these lives were bound by hunger, cold, and disease, and were approaching death step by step. They could not breathe a sigh of relief, only lamenting the gloom of the world!</p>
<p>The boundless darkness, the heavy miserable fog, combined with the raging wind and waves, made the hearts of the wanderers even more confused!</p>
<h3>Gray Crane</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>In the ancient northern city, in the emperor's great temple, it is full of solemn relics, the purple-gold courtyard top, the round and thick hall pillars, the old camphor wood armchairs, and on the white stone steps like mutton fat, there are carvings of dragons, symbolizing majesty and tyranny, dancing with claws and teeth.</p>
<p>In the ancient temple, the decorated incense burners and memorial tablets are all protected as antiques. Outside the gloomy main hall, in the thick woods, there is the queen of the sky, a group of gray cranes, flying in the shade of the trees.</p>
<p>In that ancient and quiet atmosphere, only it, a group of gray cranes, represents a group of young people, it has a gray and clever body, gray velvet-like wings, gray head, ... when it is in the golden sunlight, opening its gray-white wings, flying out of the woods, flying in the sky, the sunlight shines on it, it looks so beautiful.</p>
<p>It has a stubborn personality, and flies to the eternally circling woods every year, it will not change to another place, and fly to another place by mistake.</p>
<p>Every year, it flies from the cold and barren wilderness of Siberia, to the ancient city flying with wind and sand, following the example of its ancestors, each time, it only stays in the circle of trees, it loves freedom so much, when people are noisy and disturbing its residence, it will disappear in the clouds.</p>
<p>That circle of woods has been fenced off with iron wire, preventing tourists from running in. When spring comes, and the bright spring light shines, a group of gray cranes appear in the woods, spreading the seeds of spring light in the quiet too temple like being buried in a tomb, singing spring songs in the shade of the trees, such free and exciting songs.</p>
<p>Often, that brave gray crane, twisting its sharp beak, spreading its wings, raising its head, rushes towards the floating clouds, ... the sunlight flashes its beautiful body, ... it flies, bravely flies, ... excitedly rushes towards the brilliant sunlight.</p>

<p>Young master used to wear silk. Today, he is poor and ragged. No heels on shoes. No sleeves on clothes. Who will recruit you with disheveled hair and dirty face? The stomach is not full. No opium to smoke. There is no way to go east and no way to go west. Rack your brains to come up with bad ideas. Clever changes during the day. Try to steal at night. The thief's heart is empty and his body trembles. Afraid of leaking the incident. Turn back and grab the cigarette butt. Making a nest under the gate tower. Waste paper as a quilt. Once the north wind rises. How to spend the cold. Thinking about the past. Suffering is self-inflicted. Regret not throwing yourself into the net. Black rice is anxious. White rice is even more worried. Far-fetched idea clever plan. Tell the story and kowtow. Tears stain the clothes. Snot all over the ground. At this time, he sighs long and lies across the street. He is now yellow and thin. Skin and bones. Looks like a skeleton.</p>

<h3>What Does "Song of a Loving Mother" Depict?</h3>
<p>A truly Chinese "good wife and loving mother" type of woman marries a lazy and alcoholic husband. Since her husband is not promising, in addition to fulfilling her pitiful obligation as a woman to give birth to a large group of children, she also has to work hard and rely on her own hands to support the family, buy wine for her husband, and sew and mend clothes for her children. In this miserable life, her youth is gone, her hair turns white, and her husband breathes his last breath, and everything is over. The children grow up. The sons marry and the daughters are wed, and as a result, everyone happily enjoys their youth. An old white-haired mother with a crowd of children becomes a wanderer, homeless, and has no choice but to spend the rest of her days in an orphanage. - The giant film "Song of a Loving Mother" by Lianhua Company depicts such a story.</p>
<p>This is naturally a tragedy of ethics, but we might as well say it is the traditional tragedy of Chinese women. Now "Song of a Loving Mother" will be released at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater in Shanghai. I wonder, in addition to being moved to tears, what other feelings do the audience have?</p>
