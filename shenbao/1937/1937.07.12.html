<p>時評</p>
<h3>防守華北之必要步驟</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>华北的局势現已到臨最緊急的關頭。本駐屯軍司令已由田代易為香月。關東軍已有大批過楡關天津。結集豐臺。平市四周都有日軍活動的形跡。而第三艦隊也已開始特別警備。這種種。證明日帝國主義對於華北。已表露其武力擭取的野心所以前日蘆溝橋事件的雙方撤兵辦法在日方只是暫時緩兵之計。現在我二十九軍雖已退至永定河西。而日軍則仍盤踞蘆溝橋車站。且復大批增援。向我軍陣地猛烈砲擊。我們觀察局勢。覺得這次日軍在蘆溝橋的挑釁。實為有計劃的以武力攫奪整個華北的開端。</p>
<p>在這次蘆溝橋事件發生之前。日方卽盛傳“九一八前夜復臨”之說。有人觀察這次事件。謂其作用至少與去年九月的豐台事件相同。從這兩種說法。我們還可以斷定這次日軍的挑釁。乃是一個大規模侵略行動的初步試探。假使沒有我二十九軍的堅强抵抗。則今日之北平。早已成昔日之瀋陽。而大批的侵略軍之來。或者已將河北一舉囊括。作為旣成事實。但現在日方的挑釁。却因我軍的抵抗。不能逞共野心。於是退而求其次。日方乃要求我軍自蘆溝橋撤退。使這個平漢路上的唯一要站。變成豐台第二。然而今日我國上下都已認識這種敎訓。卽有了去年的豐台事件。才有現在的蘆溝橋事件。假如此次蘆溝橋事件仍與豐台事件同樣作讓步的解决。則侵略者逐步挺進。不斷造成同樣事件。必使整個華北被零星肢解。完全陷於敵人的控制下面而後已。</p>
<p>所以在今日我軍的防守蘆溝橋卽是防守整個的華北我當局過去曾表示對日之外交。有一定容忍之限度。若越過此限度。則任何犧牲。在所不惜。現在我們卽當以蘆溝橋為最後限度的界綫我們全國軍民當誓為廿九軍的後盾使侵略者不能越雷池一步。</p>
<p>此外。在外交方面。我國應有嚴正的聲明。昭吿全世界。使各國明瞭此次事件的責任。全在於日方。同時對於日方外交當局。則應以書而提出嚴重的抗議。我們知道這次事件發生以後。華北日軍當局卽招待各報記者。大肆宣傳。使國際間不明是非責任之所在。但我們覺得在世界列强中間。以蘇聯親歷的經騐。以美國對我的深厚同情。以英法對於遠東和平的關切。只要我們有堅强正直的表示。則國際間必予我以最大的聲援。我們應使全世界明瞭。華北為我國有機之一部。任何加以侵略割裂的企圖。必將引起我們整個民族的抗拒。</p>
<p>目前我國全民族正以最大的關心。注視華北局勢。日軍向蘆溝橋的砲擊挑釁。已引起我國上下的震憤但我們正以沉着鎮靜的步驟堅决應付。使侵略者的威脅壓迫都不能奏效不過在這嚴重的關頭。我們希望關於交涉應付的一切發展。除了軍機上的秘密不容披露外。凡屬外交上折衝的內容。必須盡量公布使民衆明瞭。這在一方面可使侵略者的片面宣傳無所用其技。一方面又可使我們整個人民的力量成為外交的後盾。我們必須以全民族的一致力量。保持華北。給侵略者的野心以最大的打擊。</p>

<p>［巴黎］關於政府决定自七月十三日起、停止比利紐斯山一帶法西兩國邊境監察一事、此間各報鮮加評論、其中“愛克西宥報”之評論可以代表各報一般之見解、略謂“法國此項决定、純係關於國家尊嚴及主權之問題、至於法國對於西內戰之不干涉政策、絕不因此而有所變更、法國此種態度、完全為英國所諒解、英政府對於不干涉西班牙內戰一事、現正覓求衷折方案、斷不因法國之决定而受牽制也”人民報一則謂、“法國此舉、原係步葡萄牙之後塵、葡國撤銷西葡兩國邊境之監察辦法、則固獲得德意兩國之贊同也、自今以後、倘不能在西班牙海陸邊境恢復公正無私之監察辦法、則吾人固已準備一切、惟有恢復對終西班牙共和政府自由通商之制度而已”云、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意德反響</h3>
<p>謂法假面具已揭開</p>
<p>［柏林］法政府决定停止實施法西邊境監察、此間民衆觀察報評論謂、“法國現已揭去其假面具矣、以前法國僅以取銷監察辦法相恫嚇、今則已加以實行、查法國對西班牙赤黨供給兵士軍火與子彈、始終未見停止、今則公然大開貿易之門戶矣”、此外各報論調亦均類似、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］注國與西班牙邊境之國際監察辦法、已由法國政府决定於本月十三日起停止實施、“斯丹巴”報頃加以評論云、“法國政府若果自願擔負不干涉政策完全失敗之全部責任則意大利即當恢復自由行動、而以軍火運交西國國民軍、並派軍艦護送意國船舶、俾遇遭受襲擊時、加以還擊”云、此在意國半官方面則以為法國政府態度頑强、實已陷於孤立地位、即如意大利日報載稱、英法兩國監察計畫業已失敗、法國惱羞成怒、爰乃出以上項决定云、“法西斯工作”報則謂、“法國何時將再有貞德聖女出世、而將法俄兩國互助公約之束縛、一舉而斷之乎”云、（中央社十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］半官機關德意志通訊社頃發表巴黎消息、僅宣佈法政府業已自本月十三日起、將法西邊境監察辦法、暫停實施、但法國此項决定實行與否、繋於匍西交界處監察辦法能否恢復、且法國仍當繼續信守不干涉恊定、此兩層則均未加提及、上項消息發出之後、德國各報即資為根據、而對法國猛烈攻擊、嗣後哈瓦斯社訪員雖要求該通訊社加以更正、但至午夜為止、仍未照辦、（中央社十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>防空與防毒（一）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>防空防毒，是目前國防上最重要的一件事，各國政府都在孜孜經營，不遺餘力。吾國政府也不甘落人之後，現正在積極設備，所以這次上海市政府成立十週年紀念慶祝中，舉行一個防空防毒展覽大會，以期喚起人民的注意。日前本埠字林報載有英國下院議員勞合德氏在倫敦無綫電廣播電臺所發關於防空防毒的演說，茲擇錄於下，俾資借鏡。讀之可以知道這件事是跟國民人人有密切的關係，急當未雨綢繆才萬無一失，臨渴掘井，是不行的再者，這件事不能完全倚賴政府，凡屬國民，大家都應該起來帮助政府，才能容易收功。其實帮助政府，便是帮助自己的全家，跟自己的本身。</p>
<p>人們有時問我，（勞合德氏自稱下同）政府為什麼現在從事製造防毒面具，跟佈置其他種種防空戒備？那答語是很簡單的。我們希望今後永遠不見戰爭，我們希望永遠沒有敵人的飛機來襲擊我們的城鎮，我們希望永遠沒有毒瓦斯投在我們的人民中。但是今日的轟炸機，飛行之速，飛程之遠，跟載重之巨，已遠非一九一八年可比。這種事實，我們必須應付的，所以我們當知道假使沒有防空的戒備，那空襲的結果，必定慘烈到萬分。</p>
<p>今日所須覺悟的要點，是這種戒備，要有一種精密的組織，跟完美的設備品的基礎，才能收效，斷不能在危險降臨的當兒，忽促間所能供給的。所以在保安政策中所準備的組織跟設備品，便是未雨綢繆，以備萬一之用。我們目前所經營的，却著看在這點。</p>
<p>在空襲的當兒，因為種種理由，平民的安全處所，便是戶內有若干簡單戒備的一個房間，例如用紙糊沒窗洞，跟用浸水的報紙把隙縫淹沒，使毒瓦斯不能侵入。這一個避險房間，可稱為第一道防綫，但是我們還須準備第二道防綫，那便是防毒面具，以防避險的房間不幸損毀，跟供在戶外的人戴了到平安地點之用。</p>
<p>因為這些事故，政府便决定凡在戰爭中處於危險的人們，無論貧富，無論有無購買力，都應該備一個防毒面具。於是怎麼設計跟製成一種可大批製造千百萬旣簡單而又妥善的防毒面具，便成了科學家跟技術專家熬費苦心，加以研究的嶄新的難題。經過長期的試騐，政府專家才完成他們的工作，所以我在數月前能在國會宣布，政府已存儲大批防毒面具，遇到緊急事變發生時，將免費發給有被攻危險的區域內的每個國民。自從我宣布這事以後，製造防毒面具的工作，便積極進行，非常迅速。試騐的製造，現在的確已進行數星期之久，每星期能出產濾毒管一萬五千枚，不久每月可以增至二百萬枚。目下所備完成的濾毒管，數以數十萬計，面具却以百萬計。</p>
<p>這些防毒面具，將存儲在全國各處，等到要用的時候　可以在緊急事變實在降臨之前發給全體民衆，非常神速。孟却斯特有一個大儲藏所，現在已很快地儲滿了。第一批防毒面具在幾天後便可運到倫敦，其他各省會在數星期後，都將設立儲藏所。倫敦到耶穌降臨節時，便可存儲應用的防毒面具一大部分。全世界首都中的全體民衆，都備有防毒面具，將推吾英為第一國。同時國內各省儲藏所，也全將滿儲防毒面具。稍緩，還將設法使民衆中願意親自試戴新防毒面具的，都可許他一試，這大約是諸君所樂聞的。</p>
<p>我願意使諸君知道這種防毒面具曾經過實在的試騐，凡政府所知能用於戰爭中的各種毒瓦斯，都能防禦，萬無一失。賀特素爾隊長跟我，最近曾數次戴了這種面具，走進播滿毒人瓦斯的特別試騐室，我們都安然無恙，毫不覺得什麼。</p>
<p>最後我願意諸君知道這種防毒面具的設備，雖然至為重要，但不過是全國建設中的國家消極防空大制度的一方面，各處地方委員會目前正在籌備組織初步救傷所，救援隊，瓦斯偵察隊，瓦斯廓淸隊，改良消防的器具，以應付燃燒彈，限其他種種計畫。</p>
<p>內備部所設的防毒學校，正在訓練各地民衆限地方人員，以便他們可以回到本地，訓練他們的同事。鐵路船港當局，大公用公司，跟其他許多商行，都在各自經營他們的防空計畫。總而言之，防空戒備的組織，現在已逐日向前推動了。</p>
<p>我最後還有一言，奉吿諸君，各地委員會不日將招募志願隊，恊助防空戒備的組織，有幾處已經實行。我所樂言的，就全部而論，人民都有十分滿意的響應，我很希望這種滿意的應募，能夠繼續不絕，推行到全國各處。在這防空的要務中，我們已證明英國雖依自由投効基礎辦理這事，所得的效果，縱不能勝過他國，也能跟各國並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>在上戰的談話當兒，來了一位英國無綫電廣播公司的代表，走到傳聲器前，把他當天在毒瓦斯室中所製成的話片，供獻給聽衆。他說道：</p>
<p>我們製這話片的當兒，實實在在站在毒瓦斯的密烟中。我們借用內務省一輛活動的毒瓦斯車，做這一番描寫。我們經過遮着帆布，不洩空氣的走道，走進車中。這種警車，專供訓練各部警官,使他們知道防毒面具跟毒瓦斯的曲折之用。我像火星中的怪人一般，戰戰兢兢地站在一個角落裏，那時一位警務稽查準備燃燒他的緊聚着毒瓦斯的手提囊。（未完）</p>

<h3>宛平事件轉趨惡化</h3>
<p>日軍向縣城取大包圍式　少壯派軍人不贊同撤兵　關東軍二千到榆關待進</p>
<p>天津通信、蘆溝橋事件、十日又突趨惡化、宛平•豐台•一帶消息、頃猶不明、北平市內、時聞隆隆砲聲、天津間交通、由十日午後三時中斷、綜合各方所得報道、為述如左</p>
<p>衝突再起</p>
<p>十日晨二時許、宛平東門外涵洞東北之高地、有未撤退之日軍二百餘名、突以機關槍向城內我保安隊掃射、歷二十分鐘經冀察會軍事顧問日人中島•協同宛平專員王冷齋、向日軍交涉、日方始謂因有戰死之日兵屍體二具、未曾搜獲、須進城搜索、因誤會保安隊先開槍、故出於防衛、是晨七時後、通州•天津•兩處日軍、各有增援、部隊開到豐台、其所駐豐台之日軍、則有三百餘開往五里店、午後三時許、日飛機三架、由天津飛往蘆溝橋•永定河右岸•及宛平縣城•上空盤旋偵查、約歷二十分鐘始他去、午後五時、豐台日軍、續有鐵車隊砲兵隊二百餘、增至蘆溝橋正面、五時十分、卽向永定河右岸我二十九軍•及宛平城內保安隊•猛攻、至六時左右少停、七時整續攻、且向宛平縣城取大包圍式、砲火之密、較前次為烈、我軍追不獲己、分別應戰、傷亡極衆、歷二十餘分鐘、日軍停攻、七時半、砲轟復起、夾以機關槍衝鋒、均遭我軍沉着擊退、八時以後、砲聲雖不斷、但因天已昏黑、方向不辨、攻擊始漸弛、</p>
<p>日軍集結</p>
<p>由十日起、日軍陸續集結、通州•唐山•天津•塘沽•各處隊伍、分批開向豐台、由豐台轉向蘆溝橋、其大本營似在豐台、前方總指揮部則在龍王廟、砲乓根據地則在五里店、駐秦皇島•榆關•南大寺各處之日軍、則向唐山集中、並已向北寗路索車、欲分批運往唐山•塘沽、再遵陸路開往豐台、十日上下午、原駐通州之日軍、因其防務業有由唐山•塘沽•開去之部隊接替、乃以三百餘名開往豐台、駐津之鈴木砲兵獨立聯隊、亦有三百餘名、偕萱島步乓第二聯隊三百餘名、乘載重汽車開豐台、故截至十日晚間止、日軍集結於豐台者、已約二千餘名、其中六百餘名、已開赴五里店•蘆溝橋、駐平步兵放團長河邊、九日下午、卽赴五里店指揮、大隊長森田、則在永定河左岸、擔任攻擊我二十九軍之指揮、軍車行動、轉趨積極、駐津之日軍主力部隊、業為緊急出動準備、倘戰况激烈、當開往增援、十日早六時、迄午後一時、日關東軍駐錦州綏中部隊、有二千餘名、分乘五列車開抵榆關、停於車站、待機前進、偽奉山路亦正調集車輛、擬運輸軍隊前來、</p>
<p>事態陡變</p>
<p>駐津日軍司令部參謀長橋本、九日到豐台晤日軍旅團長河邊、及森田•嘉田•一木•各大隊長、傳達日軍司令官田代意旨、原擬卽赴平召集和知•松井•今井•等會商善後交涉辦法、詎聞少壯派軍人頗以如此了解、有損皇軍威嚴、且恐使二十九軍生蔑視日軍人心理、以後無法壓服、故均主張非予以斷然膺懲、發揮其皇軍武威不可、同時日關東軍方面、態度强硬、慫恿駐華北日軍少壯派、必須為一鎮服×××舉動、因此橋本所齎去之使命、適受制於少壯派、祗得在豐台閱軍、慰問傷兵、延至十日午後方去平、日不會晤我方當局、日軍再度攻擊蘆溝橋、逐在河邊•和知•松并•乙中田口•等少壯派軍人孤行已意下、迭次發生、其行動亦趨尖銳化、日軍司令官田代、殆完全失却其統馭控制部下能力、十日夜十一時、日軍司令部且發出聲明、調“十日午後五時十分•七時•七時半、二十九軍夾河以迫擊砲向蘆溝橋•窰門口•兩地日軍砲擊、倘因此發生重大不幸事件、其一切責任、賞由中國方面負之”等語、揆其用意、似在轉嫁責任於我方、而為其大舉攻擊之口實、故此間咸慮此事件將擴大至不可收拾矣、</p>
<p>交通復斷</p>
<p>十日早七時、平津交通、本已恢復、惟各次車祇能於晨七時復駛入北平前門車站、北平一駛津車、亦須七時後方得開津、迨十日午後三時、蘆•豐•情形復趨緊張、永定門鐵軌、再度由我軍自動拆毀、平津交通、遂又中斷、駛平客車、到豐台後、皆折返天津、晚九時後、卽天津豐台間交通亦斷絕、豐台車站𪊽集日兵極多、站房電話房、皆為日兵把守、車站堆積日軍火甚多、來往行人、須受檢查、惟平津電話、照舊可通、呼呌仍極困難、天津方面人心漸趨恐慌、警察局長李文田、十日午後一時、召集各分局長•保安隊長•會議、討論嚴密市內治安辦法、當決定八項、卽日起清查戶口、一週內辦竣、如形跡可疑、卽行究訊、雜居處所、不許容留閒人、各區互相聯絡、警備期於綿密、管理燈火、必要時得令熄滅、</p>
<p>一綫曙光</p>
<p>迄至十日夜、秦德純猶為和平努力、與日方駐平特務機關畏松井•武官今井•第二課長和知•等不斷磋商停戰辦法、及善後各項手續、宛平專員王冷齋•冀察委會顧問日人中島•櫻井均在平、盡此一夜工夫接洽、倘有一綫曙光、當局决本和平友善宗旨、化戾氣為祥和、設對方壓迫過甚、使我無迴旋餘地、亦惟有拚却一切、雖有犧牲亦所不惜、聞十日夜間、秦德純已將此意傳達與日方、冀對方有此惕警、冀主席馮治安、定十一日早返保、交涉事責、皆由秦德純任之矣、（十日夜十二時半）</p>
<h3>撤兵談判一幕</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>救亡與演劇自由</h3>
<p>— 乃一</p>
<p>宛平的砲聲又在嚮了。這一次的是非誰屬，責任誰負，這在電訊上已明白的告訴了我們，用不到再說了。敵人在華北處心積慮的着着進逼了這麼久，我們難道一些兒覺察不出來嗎？現在，祇是在離人方面以爲事機成熟，加以引發而已。</p>
<p>在事光，我們旣未能防患未遂，把敵人趕出國境以外，制止敵人的侵略，而在事變臨頭的今天，如果再張皇失措，舉棋不定的不能妥爲對付，我們又會有怎樣的結果呢？前例都放在我們眼前，我們請隨便把那件事件來看罷。</p>
<p>現在，我們祇有集中所有的力量，來一致救亡，那才能渡過目前的危險，那才能使中華民族永生不滅！</p>
<p>而在集中力量的原則下，在一致救亡的前提下，我們對於救亡的工作，其方式，則是應該多方面的。</p>
<p>這就很快的使人想到昨天在開成立大會的“上海文化界撤銷和界電影戲曲檢查運動會，以及日前在外灘公園因唱救亡歌曲有好幾位青年被捕的事情。</p>
<p>在租界上，救亡工作之受阻礙，那眞是書不絕書，政冶的以及其他的人民團體不必說了，以電影和戲曲來說，我們也不知道經歷過了多少次，舉證過了多少次，而在這樣積壓下，撤消電影戲曲檢查運動之勃起，原是必然的，這也不必多說。而可注意的則是由這運動所引起的反應，例如因唱救亡歌曲而被捕等等，這點，昨天沈家千先生也已經說過了。</p>
<p>電影戲曲的本身就是敎育而救亡戲曲的敎育力量，從租界方面的一再阻礙上看來，那更可得一反證：際此宛平的砲聲又在嚮了，舉國一致的抗敵戰爭即將發動的現在，我們對此一向爲正人君子們視爲消愁解悶的“雕虫小技”，又該怎樣的來推動發展呢？</p>
<p>一方面，我們已在發動撇消檢查運動了；關於這一運動，我以爲，我們祇有目標異同的限制，而不應該有參加者資格的限制。因爲我們的目的是在撤消租界的非法檢查權，而並不在考騐參加的團體有否向社會局登記也。另一方面，那是說，在租界以外，在租界的非法檢查還未撤銷以前，我們應該廣大而深入地利用各種形式來推進救亡的宣傳，我們不僅應該積極地有敎亡戲曲的演出，我們更其應該把這種救亡戲曲深入到農村和工廠中去，困之，對於日前市府的當機立斷取消慶祝節目的通告，使我們異常感動，面感動之外，則還不免因所取消的節目恰巧是救亡戲劇而可惜，因爲在目前，救亡戲曲的演出，他的意義不是爲了娛樂，而是爲了敎育也。</p>
<p>而也因之，我們除希望在租界以外立刻會有盛大而普遍的救亡戲曲之演出之外，對於和界的檢查權之撤消，更感到了責任的重大和急切！</p>
<h3>華工</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>那個痲臉小伙子，身體長得很胖的，說話總帶點兒鼻音的招工委員王大扣子，俯下頭去思索了好些辰光，這時重又跑了過去，湊近洋車夫阿甩的耳邊，鬼鬼祟祟地又和他絮語起來了。</p>
<p>屋內的空氣，此刻仍是那麼嚴肅而且緊張，幾乎連一隻青蠅飛過，也可以聽得淸嗡嗡的呌響。阿甩——他這時完全正經着臉皮，在注意大扣子手裏的招工名單，他那颗心兒可更加的酥癢起來了。於是，他這回不自主地亂點着頭兒，並且亳不猶豫的將委員賜他的那張符號接了過來。</p>
<p>符號上寫著“××國鑛產委員會籌工……”等幾個清秀奪目的支那字，連阿甩自己的名字也被寫在下面。他心裏又覺得一陣高興，舉手把符號朝胸前高高地揚了一揚，怪神秘似的，重又藏進了腰包，含着笑脸。</p>
<p>他看見王委员是非常忙碌的在向別人谈论着。好容易直到臨走的時光，他才放大膽量走上前去，對這位王委员斬釘截鐵地說道：</p>
<p>“那末，我現在凖照你的吩附辦事，待下午我把車照還了再來這兒見你；不過——你們別變心……我家裏大小還有三口子，…生活可不是鬧玩的啊”！</p>
<p>阿甩把車子拖著，拖著，在一家車行的門口，他喜氣洋洋地將車輛停了下來。——</p>
<p>然而，當他看見趙老闆的時候，却故意地裝出一臉哭傷的神氣：</p>
<p>“趙老闆！你是知道的，我家裏有四口子要飯吃，天天靠我拉這輛車子眞是活不下去了。……况且，前天山東鄕下的老娘又帶信出來，說她自個兒年高啦，作下動活了……因此，我就打算明後天回到家鄕，還是自己去墾幾塊子老田……省得……一輩子飄流老在外……。”</p>
<p>“嗯，……嗯……！”趙闆鄕考慮了一會，便從鼻孔裏迸出二個字來回了他的話。隨卽，卻張紅了臉兒道：“我知道的，你們說是活得了，活不了；其實……！要去跟××人作工，是不是？”</p>
<p>“誰說的啊？——我的天！”</p>
<p>阿甩十二分難過地表示着驚訝。</p>
<p>“那兒有什麼天！——別人可瞞得了，阿甩你可瞞不了我。”做車行老闆的這時把斜曲不勻的嘴唇了一下，道：“生意做不做是隨便你的，不過我得關照你：王大扣子他們多不是好人啊！……”</p>
<p>“……”這大套話雖然還使阿甩有點猜疑，便他再想說些抵賴的話，一時可講不出來。於是，他愕然地楞住了。</p>
<p>然而趙老闆却更加的明白了他的来意。</p>
<p>阿甩！我说赚××人的錢是很不容易的！你們有這麽大的膽量去嘗試，我自然沒有什麼好說的，可是，將來……將來你們別再回頭來求托我放車（卽租車的意思）。他頓了頓“而且，怕的是一去不能重回這兒來。……這幾天你們不見滿江的浮屍嗎？”</p>
<p>阿甩心兒這時像被戳了一刀似的刺痛起來。好半晌，才又過去訴說道：</p>
<p>“老闆！我不是想發財，實在是要回老鄕去啊！”</p>
<p>“好的，你去吧！”老闆這麼說着，再也不規勸他了：“那末你把車照還我就得啦！嗯，嗯！……”</p>
<p>到家。阿甩不說一句話，連王大扣子那裏也不去蹓雊，逕自的爬在破坑上一覺睡過去了。</p>
<p>可是半夜裏，阿甩却做了一個可怕的噩夢。他夢見一片廣闊的大水，好像就和地所熟悉的那絛海道一樣。他正掛着王委員給他那塊符號在海邊眺望，突然，被人家擁簇着，把他的身子擲入了海心；他喊着，竭力的嘶喊着……</p>
<p>醒來，他一陣覺得心兒悸跳着，身子也變得異樣的空洞了。他孤獨地望着暗慘的角落，回憶着夢境，自個兒又迷茫起來了，……</p>

<h3>Kagetsu Succeeds as Japanese Army Commander</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Kagetsu, the Inspector General of the Japanese Military Education, was appointed today as the commander of the Japanese Garrison in China, replacing Tashiro, who is currently ill. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After Kagetsu arrived, he summoned Hashimoto and other military staff for a meeting at 11 p.m. on the 11th to discuss measures regarding the Lugouqiao Incident. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kagetsu Kiyoshi arrived in Tianjin at 4:30 p.m. on the 11th, escorted by eleven Japanese aircraft, and immediately took over his duties. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Kagetsu does not want people to know of his arrival, so the military is still denying the news of his arrival to the outside world. (Urgent dispatch from this newspaper at 2 a.m. on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Kagetsu, the director of the Education Bureau headquarters, went to the Army Minister's official residence at 8:00 a.m. on the 11th to receive important instructions from Army Minister Sugiyama. He left the official residence fifteen minutes later and immediately went to the General Staff Headquarters. Subsequently, at 10:00 a.m. today, he took a military aircraft from Tachikawa Airfield and flew urgently to an unspecified location. (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>⊙ Keijo According to a statement issued by the Korean Army Headquarters, the newly appointed commander of the Chinese Garrison, Lieutenant General Kagetsu, is scheduled to fly from Keijo to Changchun at 7:00 a.m. on the 12th to meet with General Ueda, commander of the Kwantung Army, to discuss countermeasures before proceeding to an unspecified location in North China. (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Hashimoto, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, did not meet with the local authorities here after arriving in Peiping on the 9th. He also failed to meet with Qin Dechun when he visited him on the morning of the 11th, and flew back to Tianjin at 1:00 p.m. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese Garrison in North China, has been transferred internally and replaced by Kagetsu Kiyoshi, a member of the younger faction. Kagetsu, the commander of the North China Garrison, was an important figure in the Japanese February 26th Incident. This transfer has attracted attention from all sides. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Kagetsu Kiyoshi served as commander of the North China Garrison in 1931, inciting Chinese traitors to form plainclothes teams to disturb Tianjin. He was promoted to lieutenant general for his merit. He is now transferred from the Director of the Japanese Military Education Headquarters. Kagetsu has long been known as a dangerous figure among Japanese soldiers. With this change, the Lugouqiao situation is feared to deteriorate further. Hashimoto, who belongs to the moderate faction of the garrison, will likely leave office with Tashiro. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Tashiro Critically Ill and Unconscious</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Tashiro is suffering from cardiac insufficiency. He fell into a coma this morning, the 11th, and lost all motor function. He is unable to swallow even a grain of rice. After Kagetsu arrived, Tashiro moved to the Maison Meier. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] It is rumored that Tashiro died of illness on the afternoon of the 11th. The military is keeping it secret to maintain morale and prestige. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Tashiro resigned to the military headquarters because junior officers disobeyed his command, and Kawabe and Kazuchi especially acted arbitrarily. He requested to return home to recuperate. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Kwantung Army Advances Towards Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The first batch of the Kwantung Army set off from Shanhaiguan at noon today, heading towards Tianjin. Because the Chinese railway authorities refused to provide special trains, the troop trains were all behind regular trains. It is reported that six trains of the Kwantung Army arrived in Shanhaiguan yesterday, and the soldiers disembarked and spent the night there. Meanwhile, according to news received from Tianjin, 700 Japanese soldiers drove past Beicang towards Fengtai in 35 heavy trucks this morning, carrying weapons such as machine guns. This afternoon, the horse races here have been suspended at the request of the Japanese military authorities, because the Japanese airfield and its barracks are close to the racecourse. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Many Japanese Aircraft from Outside the Pass Arrive in Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] A total of thirteen Japanese military aircraft from outside the pass arrived in Tianjin today, including six fighter planes, three bombers, and the rest reconnaissance planes. They are all currently parked at the airfield in front of the Japanese barracks in Dongjuzi. There are not many Japanese soldiers stationed there now, and they have been patrolling around the barracks since the 11th. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Chinese and Japanese troops briefly engaged on the afternoon of the 11th, but then stopped. Both sides are currently in a standoff. A Japanese aircraft flew over Peiping city on the morning of the 11th, circled once, and then flew to the Lugouqiao area for reconnaissance. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency at 5 p.m. on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Six Japanese Kwantung Army bombers flew from Jinzhou to Tianjin in formation at 4:30 p.m. on the 11th, circled once in the sky, and landed at the airfield in front of the Japanese barracks in Li Mingzhuang. Two aircraft from a certain company were still scouting in the sky. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] China Aviation Company received a notice from a certain party that it must move the aircraft stored in Tianjin to Qingdao and vacate the airfield. It is reported that a certain party will increase its troops by 500 from Yuguan and temporarily station them there. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Defeat Individually</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] As of the morning of the 11th, it has been determined that the Japanese aim is to eliminate the so-called anti-Japanese troops around Peiping, paying particular attention to Feng Zhi'an's 37th Division in Xiyuan. From 11 p.m. on the 10th to the morning of the 11th, they have been constantly gathering troops at Babao Mountain west of Peiping, launching fierce attacks on the strategic Yamenkou pass. The Japanese have changed to operating in regimental units since the morning of the 11th, with the main force of the First Infantry Regiment of the Kawabe Brigade taking on the task. The regimental commander, Mutaguchi, personally commanded this operation. It has now been determined that in the Lugouqiao battle: ㊀ The Babao Mountain Yamenkou is under the supervision of Colonel Mutaguchi. ㊁ The Lugouqiao Yongding River Jiahe artillery battle is commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Morita. ㊂ The encirclement of Wanping County, monitoring our security team to break out, is strafed by machine guns, commanded by Major Morita. The commander of the Kawabe Brigade moved his headquarters to Longwangting on the morning of the 11th. The Japanese are currently intending to provoke internal changes within the 29th Army. The current operation is specified as targeting Feng Zhi'an's division, hoping to defeat them individually. We have seen through their cunning scheme and will definitely not fall for their trick. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Results in Japanese Retreat</h3>
<p>[Beiping] After 2 p.m. yesterday, the Japanese troops at Lugouqiao began to deploy. At 3 p.m., they attacked our troops. At 5:30 p.m., they bombarded with artillery, and the battle was fierce. It paused slightly at 8 p.m. At 9 p.m., the Japanese troops attempted to seize the Shagang highland northeast of Wanping City. The Japanese troops launched a fierce attack with the 188th Regiment. This battle was extremely fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. At 1:15 a.m. this morning, the Japanese troops increased to a battalion and continued to attack Shagang. At 2:40 a.m., a ceasefire was called. At 2 a.m. this morning, another group of Japanese troops attempted to cross the Yongding River south of Wanping City, intending to attack the rear of our troops at Yinglong Temple. A fierce battle lasted for two hours. The Japanese troops were finally repelled, and Song was able to cross the river. At 4 a.m. this morning, the majority of the two groups of Japanese troops retreated to Dajing Village. At 9 a.m. this morning, the Japanese troops increased their infantry by 700 to 800 men and fiercely attacked Dawa Yao. After a fierce battle for half an hour, they retreated again. Wanping County and Lugouqiao have always been in the hands of our troops. It is reported that the reason for the Japanese troops' two attacks was the order from the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, seemingly intending to occupy one or two places as bargaining chips during negotiations. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Reinforcements Gather in Fengtai</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] At 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, more than 400 soldiers from the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Tianjin Japanese Army opened a reinforcement road to Lugouqiao in more than 20 vehicles to Fengtai. Because too many Japanese troops had gathered, civilian houses were occupied, and merchants and residents all fled. On the morning of the 11th, the Japanese cavalry in Fengtai reconnoitered the movements of our 38th Division around Huangtupo Station in Nanyuan, and a skirmish occurred. The Japanese troops were repelled by our army, and our army is still under strict guard. The security of Fengtai Town is currently maintained by a small number of police, and all transportation and construction are in the hands of the Japanese. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese troops stationed in Qin Yinan Dasi have boarded two trains and arrived in Tangshan on the morning of the 11th. At noon, they marched to Tongfeng on foot, with a number of about 600. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The bodies of Japanese soldiers from Lugouqiao were loaded onto three large trucks last night and taken back to Fengtai. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] After the Lugouqiao Incident reversed, the Japanese side here transported military supplies to Fengtai in a large number of baggage trucks on the morning of the 11th. All baggage trucks from car dealerships in the Japanese concession were requisitioned on the morning of the 11th. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Five large trucks of gasoline and bullets from the Tianjin Japanese Army were transported to Fengtai at 4 p.m. on the 11th. Another special military train was opened at 9 p.m., with soldiers escorting nine cars of gunpowder and other items, also transported to Fengtai. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Headquarters Withdraws to Another Location</h3>
<p>[Beiping] The military headquarters occupying the Lugouqiao train station entrance reportedly withdrew to another location this afternoon. The location is unknown. The road embankment room and important equipment inside the station have been destroyed. The railway and telegraph poles in the Lugouqiao area have been cut off, making it difficult to restore in the short term. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] When each train on the Beining Line passes through Fengtai, Japanese soldiers board the train for inspection. The Peiping-Shenyang through train, which was scheduled to arrive in Peiping at 9:30 a.m. this morning, was suddenly detained by Japanese troops when it arrived in Yuguan. The passengers were driven off, and more than 200 Japanese soldiers boarded the train and went to Tianjin from Yu. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Obstacles on the Langfang Railway Track</h3>
<p>[Beiping] The Pinghan train is still not running. The various trains on the Beining Line are departing from Xizhimen Station because of obstacles on the railway track outside Yongdingmen, but it is not running again in the afternoon. The station is temporarily refunding tickets. It is rumored that there are obstacles on the Langfang railway track. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese troops stationed in Beining, Qianyu, Guan Changli, Beidaihe, and other places have now mostly concentrated in Tangshan. It is reported that they will take the Tongzhou road from Tangshan to open Fengtai. The number of Japanese Kwantung Army troop trains staying in Jianguan has increased to six or seven, and they also have the appearance of going west to Tangshan and transferring to Tongzhou. Also, at noon on the 11th, the Peiping-Yu 42nd train, which departed from Jianguan to Tianjin, had more than 60 Japanese soldiers forcibly board the train and come along. It can arrive in Tianjin at 7 p.m. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Our Troops Firmly Defend Wanping County</h3>
<p>[Beiping] At dawn this morning, Peiping was surrounded by a very tense atmosphere. However, on the surface, apart from military preparations near the city gates, there are still few alarming scenes. The residents still maintain a calm attitude and carry on as usual as far as the environment permits. However, rural farmers have not been able to return goods into the city, so food prices are soaring. Two Japanese aircraft flew over Peiping sky this morning and headed toward Wanping. The situation in Wanping is currently unclear, but Wanping City is still in the hands of the Chinese army. According to Chinese sources, the fighting last night was caused by the Japanese army first breaking their word and returning to Wanping, resulting in a clash. As for the true reason for the Japanese army returning to Wanping, it is not yet known. After 12 p.m. yesterday afternoon, artillery fire was heard, but it soon subsided. After the Japanese reinforcements arrived in the evening, the artillery fire resumed. It is reported that around 9:30 p.m., the fighting stopped. Chinese railway authorities reported last night that two Japanese troop trains passed through Tianjin and arrived in Fengtai. Japanese soldiers then set off in all directions, seemingly surrounding Peiping. The troop trains were carrying tanks, field guns, and machine guns. At Shijing Mountain (transliteration), about ten miles northwest of Peiping, which is the location of the Peiping Electric Plant, 100 Japanese soldiers were reportedly discovered nearby. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Residents inside Wanping City have all been evacuated, with only troops guarding the city. Four hundred refugees from the county fled to Peiping this morning and are temporarily living in Baoguo Temple inside Guang'anmen. Wang Lengzhai is being treated at the German hospital due to overwork in running around for negotiations and is still expressing his willingness to serve the public despite his illness. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Pretext for Protecting Overseas Chinese and Fleet Security</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Third Fleet began security operations uniformly on the morning of the 11th to protect Japanese overseas Chinese in China and uphold their rights and interests. There are currently 30,000 Japanese overseas Chinese in Shanghai, 20,000 in Qingdao, 10,000 in Tianjin, 5,000 along the Yangtze River, and 5,000 in South China. (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Qingdao] The Japanese official agencies here and Rear Admiral Shimomura, commander of the 11th Squadron, held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 11th to discuss methods for protecting overseas Chinese. (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Rear Admiral Tanimoto, commander of the Japanese First Squadron, returned to Hankou yesterday afternoon from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the warship Hotsu. Because the situation in North China is critical, he ordered the 11th Squadron to urgently take up security duties and the Marines to stand by to protect Japanese overseas Chinese. (Dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Peiping and Tianjin Circles Handle Comfort Activities</h3>
<p>[Beiping] The Peiping-Tianjin Education Federation convened a meeting of all circles today and decided to form a Peiping City Joint Association to visit various authorities to inquire about the current situation and handle comfort activities. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Each city gate in Peiping City opened one door at around 8:00 a.m. this morning to let pedestrians through, and closed after about half an hour. Afterwards, it was opened once every two hours. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>[Beiping] The Peiping Post Office announced that mail sent from Peiping to the Pinghan Road will be transported via Pingmen Road to Mentougou, then connected to Changxindian via dry road, and then transported via the Pinghan Road. However, heavy mail to Pinghan, Pingpu, and other roads will all be temporarily sent to Datong, taking the Tongpu Road to Zhengda Road to Shijiazhuang and then transferred to the Suhai Road. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Several representatives from Tsinghua students went to comfort the soldiers of the 29th Army in groups on the morning of the 11th and presented a large number of comfort items. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Qin Dechun Sends a Telegram to Nanjing to Report</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Shijun, Song Zheyuan's representative in Nanjing, spoke with Qin Dechun, the mayor of Beiping, via long-distance telephone lines between Nanjing and Peiping twice, at 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on the 11th. The first time, Qin reported that the Japanese army disregarded the righteousness of withdrawing troops and repeatedly attacked Lugouqiao for the third time yesterday, which our side bravely repelled. The second time, Qin stated that there had been no major contact in the front line from 7:00 a.m. to the time of the phone call at 6:00 p.m. The security in Peiping and Tianjin was excellent, the morale of the army was high, and the defenses were very thorough. It is reported that Li has reported the contents of the two phone calls to Minister He Yingqin and Minister Wang Chonghui separately. According to a certain important person who received a telegram from Peiping, the Japanese side sent personnel to contact the Hebei-Chahar authorities on the 11th, expressing regret over the incident and expressing condolences to the officers and soldiers who died on both sides, saying that they should strive to minimize the situation. Those with inside information believe that this move by the Japanese side may be a delaying tactic, as ten Japanese troop trains have entered from outside the customs through the customs, abandoning the Qinhuangdao area, and are attached to fifty aircraft, indicating that the Japanese side has planned to expand the matter.

<p>[Nanjing] While the Lugouqiao Incident was being peacefully resolved, the Japanese army suddenly broke the agreement and advanced on our garrison. At noon on the 11th, the 29th Army's office in Nanjing received telegrams from Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, and Feng Zhi'an, which were forwarded to the central government for reporting. The contents included detailed reports on the Japanese army's breach of the agreement and attack.

Li Shijun, the director of the office, will go to Guangzhou within the day. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Statement by the Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Lugouqiao Incident</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Should Be Fully Responsible for Violating the Agreement and Attacking Our Side's Maintenance of Peace Is Universally Recognized</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the Japanese army's failure to withdraw troops in accordance with the agreement and its repeated attacks on our garrison in Lugouqiao, the spokesman of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued the following statement: According to reports, the Japanese army did not comply with the agreed-upon measures to cease military action and refused to withdraw completely to the designated location. First, they left more than 200 troops at Wulidian northeast of Lugouqiao, and then mobilized a large number of troops, more than 1,000, to gather at Dawayao, three miles northeast of Lugouqiao. From 6 p.m. on the 10th, they continuously launched fierce attacks on our garrison in Lugouqiao. At the same time, they mobilized large armies from both inside and outside Japan, continuously sending them to Peiping and Tianjin, intending to carry out large-scale military operations. To the extent that their initial purpose has been thoroughly exposed, the Lugouqiao Incident has once again become serious, and the responsibility should naturally be borne by the Japanese side. This incident originated late at night on the 7th, when the Japanese army was illegally conducting exercises at Lugouqiao and claimed that a soldier was missing, demanding to search the city. After our side refused, they fired artillery and attacked the city, causing a conflict. It is very obvious that this was a planned and purposeful action by the Japanese side. Lugouqiao was originally not a place where foreign troops were allowed to garrison and conduct exercises according to the treaty. The illegality of their behavior is beyond doubt. In addition to the Lugouqiao garrison defending the territory and bravely resisting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Embassy, demanding that the Japanese army immediately stop its military actions, and declared that it would reserve all legitimate demands. On the other hand, the local authorities and representatives of the Japanese army negotiated, hoping for a peaceful resolution of the incident as soon as possible. It can be said that our side's painstaking efforts to maintain peace are universally recognized. Fortunately, a solution was agreed upon by both sides on the evening of the 8th: ㊀ Both sides cease military action; ㊁ The troops deployed by both sides return to their original defenses; ㊂ Lugouqiao is still garrisoned by our troops. The Japanese side claimed that the incident could be brought to an end here. Initially, it was unexpected that the so-called troop withdrawal measures were just a delaying tactic by the Japanese army, with no sincerity in resolving peace. China's national policy is to maintain peace externally and engage in production and construction internally. All outstanding issues between China and Japan are willing to be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. It is hoped that Japan will immediately stop its military actions, abide by the previous agreement, withdraw its troops immediately, and, in order to avoid future conflicts, effectively prevent illegal garrisoning and exercises, so that the situation can improve and be resolved more easily. Otherwise, if one mistake leads to another, Japan will inevitably fail to escape its serious responsibility, and the peace and tranquility of the Far East may inevitably become more dangerous, which is not a blessing for the overall situation.

Hidaka said that there was news that the Chinese central army was currently moving north, which the Japanese side was very uneasy about. Chen replied that he firmly believed that the Chinese army had no intention of challenging the Japanese army, but it was difficult to tolerate any foreign country arbitrarily increasing troops to China and invading China's territorial sovereignty, so it had no choice but to make normal defenses. He deeply hoped that the Japanese authorities would repent and not put China in a dangerous state. Hidaka also thought so, and bid farewell at 5:30 p.m. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 11th)</p>

<h3>International Concern Arises from North China War News</h3>
<p>German Newspaper Does Not Take Sides; American Newspaper Calls It a Dangerous Game</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, the spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry stated that the news of the war in North China naturally raises concerns about international repercussions. However, the information from both sides is largely contradictory. Currently, hesitation outweighs concern. We have not yet received detailed reports, so we cannot offer accurate opinions. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] All German newspapers are publishing news of the North China war in prominent positions. Germany does not attempt to conceal the gravity of the situation and clearly does not want to side with either party. Both sides' official statements are published equally. The "Posen Daily" carried an editorial stating that the immediate cause of the war is likely the hot weather and frayed nerves. Such wars often end in reconciliation. The peaceful outcome this time depends on both sides not overreacting. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" reported that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has trained the Chinese army into a strong force, no longer as listless as before. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The "Washington Post" today published an editorial titled "Playing with Fire," discussing the situation that the incident near Lugou Bridge could cause. The article begins by stating that the situation in North China is very dangerous if the Kwantung Army is allowed to continue the same tactics it has employed there in recent years. It is not yet clear which side, Chinese or Japanese, initiated the conflict, but this point is very important. In the past, Japanese troops have frequently conducted night exercises near Chinese troop encampments, causing incidents. The newspaper continued, stating that Japan had a dispute with the Soviet Union a week ago and is now provoking China, demonstrating the restlessness and instability of the Japanese military. Japan's activities in North China have made China uneasy. It is unknown when the frequent Japanese exercises will turn into actual actions to expand Japan's control over North China. In fact, the Kwantung Army has expanded its control since Japan occupied Manchuria. The newspaper concludes that playing with fire is a dangerous act, especially near a powder keg.

<h3>Necessary Steps to Defend North China</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The situation in North China has reached its most critical juncture. The commander of the garrison army has been changed from Tashiro to Kasagi. Large numbers of Kwantung Army troops have crossed the Yu Pass to Tianjin. Japanese troops are gathering in Fengtai. Japanese troops are active around Beijing. The Third Fleet has also begun special alert status. All this demonstrates that the Japanese imperialists have revealed their ambition to seize North China by force. Therefore, the previous agreement for both sides to withdraw troops in the Lugou Bridge incident was only a temporary delaying tactic on the Japanese side. Now, although our 29th Army has retreated to the west of the Yongding River, Japanese troops still occupy Lugou Bridge Station and are reinforcing in large numbers, heavily shelling our army's positions. Observing the situation, we feel that this Japanese provocation at Lugou Bridge is a planned beginning to seize the entire North China by force.</p>
<p>Before this Lugou Bridge incident occurred, the Japanese side widely circulated the saying "The eve of the September 18th Incident has returned." Some observers of this incident said that its effect is at least the same as the Fengtai incident of last September. From these two statements, we can also determine that this Japanese provocation is a preliminary probe for a large-scale invasion. If not for the strong resistance of our 29th Army, today's Beijing would have already become the Shenyang of the past, and the arrival of a large number of invading troops would have swept up Hebei in one fell swoop as an accomplished fact. But now, the Japanese provocation cannot fulfill its ambition due to our army's resistance. Therefore, they retreat to seek the next best thing. The Japanese side is now demanding that our army withdraw from Lugou Bridge, turning this only important station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway into a second Fengtai. However, today our country, both above and below, has recognized this lesson. It is because of last year's Fengtai incident that there is now the Lugou Bridge incident. If this Lugou Bridge incident is still resolved with the same concessions as the Fengtai incident, then the aggressors will advance step by step, constantly creating similar incidents, inevitably causing the entire North China to be dismembered piecemeal and completely fall under the control of the enemy before it is done.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, defending Lugou Bridge means defending the entire North China. Our authorities have previously stated that our diplomacy with Japan has a certain limit of tolerance. If this limit is crossed, then no sacrifice will be spared. Now we should take Lugou Bridge as the final limit. Our entire nation, both military and civilians, should pledge to be the backing of the 29th Army, so that the aggressors cannot cross the Lei River one step.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of diplomacy, our country should make a solemn statement, announcing to the whole world so that all countries understand that the responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the Japanese side. At the same time, we should lodge a serious protest in writing to the Japanese diplomatic authorities. We know that after this incident occurred, the Japanese military authorities in North China hosted reporters and advertised extensively, causing international confusion about the location of right and wrong responsibility. But we feel that among the world powers, with the Soviet Union's direct experience, with America's deep sympathy for us, with Britain and France's concern for peace in the Far East, as long as we have a strong and upright expression, then the international community will definitely give us the greatest support. We should make the whole world understand that North China is an organic part of our country. Any attempt to invade and divide it will inevitably arouse the resistance of our entire nation.</p>
<p>Currently, our entire nation is watching the situation in North China with the greatest concern. The Japanese army's shelling provocation at Lugou Bridge has aroused shock and anger throughout our country. But we are resolutely responding with calm and steady steps, so that the threats and oppression of the aggressors cannot work. However, at this critical juncture, we hope that all developments regarding negotiations should be made public as much as possible, except for military secrets that cannot be disclosed. This will prevent the aggressors' one-sided propaganda from being effective, and it will also make the power of our entire people the backing of diplomacy. We must use the unified power of the entire nation to preserve North China and give the greatest blow to the ambition of the aggressors.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kong Completes Mission and Bids Farewell to American Friends</h3>
<p>Expresses Satisfaction with American Economic Aid; Kong to Leave New York for Europe on Wednesday</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has held meetings with US government officials several times over the past few weeks and is scheduled to leave here tomorrow night to embark for Europe from New York. Therefore, he specially published a farewell speech to American friends today, saying that he was very honored to receive the hospitality of government leaders and important groups during this visit to the United States. He predicts that the gold and silver exchange agreement signed between China and the United States will further advance China's currency reform and also benefit the business of the two countries. "The two major countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean have always had close relations, and now they are promoting the friendship between the two countries through monetary and economic cooperation. It is expected that the trade between the two countries will increase, the currency will stabilize, and the peace and political stability of the world will benefit." Kong also thanked Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank, for granting credit to China. Kong will leave New York for Europe on Wednesday and will end everything here today and draft a report on his visit to the United States. (National Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Dr. Kong Xiangxi and his party are scheduled to leave New York for France on the 14th aboard the "Normandie," and then transfer from Paris to Germany for a short rest before returning home. Dr. Kong recently gave a speech to the press, expressing his satisfaction with the cooperation between US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and the Federal Reserve Bank and the Chinese Ministry of Finance to consolidate the financial foundation and develop trade between China and the United States. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Today's cover of the "Washington Post" carried an article by the famous political commentator Walter Lippmann, elaborating in detail on the importance of the new Kong-Morgenthau agreement to exchange US dollars for Chinese silver. The article states that this agreement, in addition to strengthening the economic ties between China and the United States, will also make China's national system more consolidated and allow it to join the ranks of the world's powers. The exact numbers of silver and gold mutually purchased by China and the United States have not yet been announced. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Finance Minister of China, have both agreed not to announce the amount of silver and gold mutually purchased by both parties, because this move would only provide speculators with valuable information. However, according to financial sources, the so-called huge amount of gold may refer to gold worth 10 million or 50 million US dollars. Therefore, it is widely believed that the amount of gold and silver exchanged between China and the United States is probably no more than this number. According to Vice President Kong, the gold purchased by China will be kept in the United States as a reserve for China's currency. It makes no difference where the gold is stored. This gold reserve is sufficient to increase the credit of the Chinese government's monetary system. The article concludes that Sino-US trade has increased in the first month of this year, with Chinese exports to the US increasing by 30% and US exports to China increasing by 65%.

<h3>Japanese Spies Active in Russia</h3>
<p>Colluding with Special Envoys</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Communist Party newspaper "Pravda" recently published an article exposing Japanese espionage activities in the Soviet Union, saying that "a Trotskyite named Kniyazev sabotaged railway traffic as many as 15 times between 1935 and 1937. A major Japanese spy, who works at the Japanese embassy, ​​asked Kniyazev to find a way to add bacteria to military food. This plan will be implemented only when the Russo-Japanese War begins." The newspaper also said that a man named Gulbakanrif is now in Japan and is the main organizer of espionage work in the Soviet Far East Jewish Autonomous Oblast. In addition, various newspapers have continued to write articles against foreign espionage activities, with the most vehement attacks against Japanese espionage activities.

<h3>Soviet and Swedish Foreign Policies Aligned</h3>
<p>Maintaining the Principle of Collective Security; Turkey and Russia Renew Old Ties</p>
<p>[Moscow] Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, who came here to visit on the 9th of this month, has recently started his return trip. (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] After the Swedish Foreign Minister visited here some time ago, an official communique was recently released, stating, "The Swedish Foreign Minister and People's Committee Chairman Molotov and Foreign Minister Litvinov held talks on the relationship between the Soviet Union and Sweden and the general international situation. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of normal relations between each other in politics, economics, and culture, and reiterated that both countries are determined to achieve lasting peace and security and maintain their political independence. The diplomatic policies of both countries should be based on the collective security system based on the League of Nations Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact as their fundamental principle." (Central News Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>[Turkish Capital] Foreign Minister Suat and Interior Minister Sukru are scheduled to arrive in Moscow on the 13th of this month to seek to renew the old ties between Turkey and Russia. Turkey and the Soviet Union have had very close relations over the years, but in recent months, the feelings of both sides have been quite cold. The Soviet side believes that the 1920 Treaty of Alliance between Russia and Turkey stipulates that the Turkish government should consult with the Soviet government on all international issues before acting, but recently, the Turkish government's various diplomatic actions have been quite independent in tendency, which is inappropriate. On the Turkish side, it is believed that the Soviet Union's interference in Turkish foreign policy is unacceptable to Turkey. Not only that, but during the Montreux Conference in June and July last year, an agreement was reached on restoring fortifications in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. Later, when the League of Nations dealt with the dispute between France and Turkey over the cities of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, Russia and Turkey both expressed dissatisfaction with the positions taken by the other party. This is also the reason for the cold feelings between the two countries. This time, important Turkish figures are going to the Soviet Union, which should make up for this shortcoming. Political figures are all confident that the results of Suat and Sukru's trip will be fruitful, because in terms of political needs and geographical location, the policies of Russia and Turkey towards Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Near East should not be at odds with each other.

<p>Strong Opposition from Both Arab and Jewish Nationalities</p>
<p>[Jerusalem] After receiving a telegram from the Higher Arab Committee of Palestine, requesting them to rise up in opposition to the Royal Commission's partition plan in the name of God and religion, Iraq and Kuwait (a Jewish state in the Arabian Peninsula), both Islamic countries, have recently expressed their opinions and do not agree to the division of Palestine. Iraqi Prime Minister Suleiman replied to the Higher Committee today, saying that the Iraqi government will lodge a formal protest with the British government against this plan and is willing to assist the Arabs of Palestine to achieve their goals. The King of Kuwait also sent a reply with similar wording, but the King of Transjordan, in his reply telegram, repeatedly stated that he would be the support of the Arabs, but advised the Higher Committee to study the Royal Commission's report.

A certain leader of the faction recently gave a speech to a Havas reporter, discussing the report submitted by the British Royal Commission on the Palestine issue, saying, "According to the report's proposal, the area of ​​the future Jewish state is only 5,000 to 6,000 square kilometers, while the Arab state has as many as 96,000 square kilometers. Also, the holy city of Jerusalem is not included in the future Jewish state. How can we accept this? Regarding this report, Jews around the world will soon hold a referendum to express their opinions on the partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. We firmly believe that the results of the vote will show that opponents will account for the vast majority." The date and method of the vote will be decided by representatives of various groups affiliated with the Zionist Federation at a meeting in London within the next half month. Once the results of the vote are announced, they will be submitted to a temporary meeting of the League of Nations Mandates Commission before the end of July to serve as a basis for discussion.

<h3>US Government Announces Construction of Two Additional Battleships</h3>
<p>Equipped with 16-Inch Caliber Guns</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department recently announced that, regarding the limitation of battleship cannon caliber, the US government's repeated negotiations with relevant countries have proven that governments have failed to unanimously accept the 14-inch limitation stipulated in last year's London Naval Treaty between Britain, France, and the United States. Therefore, the US government has decided that the two battleships currently under construction will each be equipped with 16-inch caliber cannons. The State Department did not specify which country refused the 14-inch caliber limitation. A high-ranking official from the Navy Department stated that the two new US battleships each have three gun turrets, each equipped with three 16-inch caliber cannons, totaling nine cannons. The range of these cannons is estimated to be 17.5 nautical miles, and the projectiles fired weigh one ton. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>British Government Entrusted to Seek a Compromise</h3>
<p>France Resolves to Abolish Border Surveillance, Gains Full Understanding from Britain</p>
<p>[London] After being entrusted by the Adjustment Committee to seek a compromise between the surveillance plans of Britain and France and the counter-proposals of Italy and Germany, it is generally expected that the plan to be proposed by Britain will be divided into two parts: ① Britain and France will temporarily undertake the surveillance work of the entire Spanish coast, and Italy, Germany, and other neutral countries will be invited to send observers to monitor aboard British and French surveillance warships. ② After the above temporary surveillance plan is accepted, the Adjustment Committee will study a more detailed plan, which advocates: (A) Dispatching observers to perform surveillance work in the ports belonging to both sides of the Spanish war; (B) Implementing aerial surveillance measures; (C) Withdrawing volunteers from various countries within Spain, and linking this measure to the recognition of both sides of the Spanish Civil War as belligerent entities. According to reports, until yesterday, Britain originally advocated implementing the second measure first. Now, it will first restore the maritime surveillance plan in the form of a compromise, so that Italy and Germany can accept it, and then it can consider the second step. London diplomatic circles now believe that this compromise plan can be accepted by Italy and Germany, because representatives from those countries, as well as representatives from the Soviet Union and Portugal, all expressed their desire to maintain the non-intervention agreement at the Adjustment Committee yesterday. If maritime surveillance can be quickly restored, the main difficulty will no longer exist. It is generally believed that the Adjustment Committee will hold a plenary meeting next Tuesday or Wednesday (i.e., the 13th or 14th of this month) to discuss the British compromise plan. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the government's decision to suspend surveillance along the French-Spanish border in the Pyrenees Mountains from July 13th, local newspapers have rarely commented on it. The commentary in "L'Époque" can represent the general view of the newspapers, roughly stating, "This decision by France is purely a matter of national dignity and sovereignty. As for France's policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, it will not change as a result. This attitude of France is fully understood by Britain. The British government is currently seeking a compromise plan for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and will not be constrained by France's decision." "Le Populaire" stated, "France's move is originally following in the footsteps of Portugal. Portugal's revocation of the surveillance measures on the Spanish-Portuguese border has indeed been endorsed by Germany and Italy. From now on, if fair and impartial surveillance measures cannot be restored on the land and sea borders of Spain, then we are already prepared for everything and can only restore the system of free trade with the legitimate Spanish Republican government." (Havas News Agency, 11th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Italian and German Reactions</h3>
<p>Saying France's Mask Has Been Removed</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the French government's decision to suspend the implementation of surveillance on the French-Spanish border, the "Völkischer Beobachter" commented, "France has now removed its mask. Previously, France only threatened to cancel the surveillance measures, but now it has implemented it. Investigations show that France has never stopped supplying soldiers, weapons, and ammunition to the Spanish Reds. Now it has openly opened the doors to trade." In addition, the arguments of other newspapers are similar. (Havas News Agency, 11th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] The French government has decided to suspend the implementation of international surveillance measures on the border between [the country being referred to, likely Spain based on context] and Italy from the 13th of this month. "La Stampa" recently commented, "If the French government is willing to bear the full responsibility for the complete failure of the non-intervention policy, then Italy should restore free action, transport weapons to the Spanish National Army, and send warships to escort Italian ships to retaliate in case of attack." In the semi-official Italian view, the French government's stubborn attitude has indeed fallen into isolation. For example, "Il Giornale d'Italia" reported that the British and French surveillance plans have failed, and France, out of frustration, has made the above decision. "Il Lavoro Fascista" stated, "When will France have another Joan of Arc emerge to sever the bonds of the French-Russian mutual assistance pact in one fell swoop?" (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The semi-official German News Agency recently published a dispatch from Paris, only announcing that the French government has temporarily suspended the French-Spanish border surveillance measures from the 13th of this month. However, it did not mention that the implementation of this decision by France depends on whether the surveillance measures at the [likely French and Spanish] border can be restored, and that France should continue to abide by the non-intervention agreement. After the above news was released, German newspapers used it as a basis to launch fierce attacks on France. Subsequently, although a Havas News Agency reporter requested the news agency to correct it, it still did not comply by midnight. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Eden Travels to France</h3>

<h3>Endless Troubles in Spain</h3>
<p>The Civil War Will Soon Reach Its First Anniversary; Government Troops Achieve Victory in Counteroffensive Near the Capital</p>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish Civil War began on July 18th last year, and it is now less than a week away from its anniversary. Battles on various front lines are becoming more active again. (Havas News Agency, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Andaye: After the Spanish government forces launched a large-scale offensive, there is intense fighting northwest of Madrid. The government issued a communique last night stating that it had achieved a great victory and recovered the three important towns of Brunete, Villanueva de la Cañada, and Quijorna. However, news from the Nationalist forces in Salamanca claimed that 45,000 government troops attacked for three days without success, losing 10,000 men, including 4,000 killed in action. (Reuters, 11th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding rumors of a possible mediation between the two sides of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Embassy in France issued a special communique to deny it, stating, "The Spanish government believes that there is absolutely no possibility of mediation between the legitimate government and the rebellious elements."

<h3>Contents of the New Franco-German Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Tariff Reciprocity, Exchange of Coal and Iron</p>
<p>[Paris] The detailed contents of the Franco-German trade agreement signed today have now been announced, including agreements on goods, payment methods, and goods transportation. It is generally based on the Franco-German agreement of June 28, 1934. The new agreement will take effect from August 1st of this year and will be valid for two years, until July 31, 1939. The most significant differences between the new treaty and the old agreement are: ① Both parties pay in cash for transactions, without using clearing agreements; ② Trade calculations are based on German exports as the standard, and the repayment plan is based on the estimated annual German exports, which will reach approximately 324,000 marks in 1937, equivalent to 3,180,000,000 francs. The following three items must be deducted from this amount: ① Unexpected expenses; ② Repayment of the French suspension agreement; ③ Balance clearing of goods transactions. As for the value of French goods exported to Germany each year, it remains 1,637,000,000 francs, or 156,500,000 marks, approximately 13,000,000 marks per month. In addition, the trade agreement expands the quota and reduces certain important tariffs. The most-favored-nation treatment clause has been retained, but the tax rates for some goods have also been determined, with both increases and decreases. The most significant fact is the trade in coking coal. In the future, France's coking coal will be entirely supplied by Germany, with Germany exporting at least 275,000 tons of coal per month to France, and France will exchange it with 7,200,000 tons of iron ore per year.

<h3>Order</h3>
<p>The State Council issued an order on the 8th, stating that the revised Publishing Law is hereby promulgated. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Air Defense and Gas Defense (I)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Air defense and gas defense are currently the most important matters in national defense. Governments around the world are diligently managing them and sparing no effort. Our government is also unwilling to lag behind and is actively preparing. Therefore, a Air Defense and Gas Defense Exhibition was held during the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government to arouse public attention. The "Shanghai Evening Post" recently published a speech on air defense and gas defense given by British Member of Parliament Lloyd George at the London Wireless Radio Station, which is excerpted below for reference. Reading it can show that this matter is closely related to every citizen, and we should prepare for a rainy day to avoid any mistakes. Digging a well when you are thirsty is not feasible. Furthermore, this matter cannot be completely relied upon by the government. All citizens should rise up to help the government so that it can easily achieve success. In fact, helping the government is helping your own family and yourself.</p>
<p>People sometimes ask me (Lloyd George referring to himself, hereinafter the same), why is the government now engaged in manufacturing gas masks and arranging various other air defense preparations? The answer is very simple. We hope never to see war again in the future. We hope that enemy planes will never attack our towns. We hope that no poisonous gas will be dropped on our people. However, today's bombers, with their speed, range, and carrying capacity, are far from comparable to those of 1918. We must deal with this fact, so we should know that without air defense preparations, the consequences of an air raid will inevitably be tragic.</p>
<p>The key point to realize today is that this kind of preparation requires a precise organization and a foundation of perfect equipment to be effective. It cannot be provided hastily when danger comes. Therefore, the organization and equipment prepared in the security policy are precautions to be used in case of emergency. We are currently focusing on this point.</p>
<p>During an air raid, for various reasons, the safe place for civilians is a room with some simple precautions indoors, such as pasting paper over window holes and covering the gaps with soaked newspapers to prevent poisonous gas from entering. This shelter room can be called the first line of defense, but we must also prepare a second line of defense, which is a gas mask, to prevent the shelter room from being damaged and to be used by people outdoors to reach a safe place.</p>
<p>Because of these incidents, the government decided that all people in danger during the war, regardless of wealth or ability to purchase, should have a gas mask. Therefore, how to design and manufacture a simple and effective gas mask that can be mass-produced in the millions became a new and difficult problem that scientists and technical experts painstakingly researched. After a long period of testing, government experts completed their work, so I was able to announce in Congress a few months ago that the government has stored a large number of gas masks, which will be distributed free of charge to every citizen in areas at risk of attack in the event of an emergency. Since I announced this, the work of manufacturing gas masks has been actively underway and very rapid. Trial manufacturing has indeed been going on for several weeks now, with a weekly output of 15,000 filter canisters, which will soon be increased to 2 million per month. The number of completed filter canisters currently prepared is in the hundreds of thousands, and the number of masks is in the millions.</p>
<p>These gas masks will be stored throughout the country and can be distributed very quickly to the entire population before an emergency actually occurs when they are needed. Manchester has a large storage facility that is now filling up quickly. The first batch of gas masks will be transported to London in a few days, and other provincial capitals will have storage facilities established in a few weeks. London will have a large portion of the gas masks needed stored by Christmas. Having all citizens in the capital of the world equipped with gas masks will make Britain the first country. At the same time, storage facilities in various provinces across the country will also be full of gas masks. After a short delay, we will also find ways to allow people who are willing to try on the new gas masks themselves to try them on. This is probably what you are happy to hear.</p>
<p>I would like to let you know that this gas mask has undergone real tests and can defend against all kinds of poisonous gases that the government knows can be used in war without fail. Captain Hothusoul and I have recently worn these masks several times and walked into a special test chamber filled with poisonous gas. We were safe and sound and felt nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like you to know that the equipment of this gas mask, although extremely important, is only one aspect of the national passive air defense system under construction throughout the country. Local committees are currently preparing to organize preliminary casualty stations, rescue teams, gas reconnaissance teams, gas decontamination teams, and improved fire-fighting equipment to deal with incendiary bombs, limit other plans.</p>
<p>The Gas Defense School established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs is training local people to limit local personnel so that they can return to their local areas and train their colleagues. The Railway and Port Authorities, large public companies, and many other commercial firms are all managing their own air defense plans. In short, the organization of air defense preparations is now moving forward day by day.</p>
<p>I have one last word to tell you that local committees will soon recruit volunteer teams to assist in the organization of air defense preparations, and several places have already implemented it. What I am happy to say is that, on the whole, the people have responded with great satisfaction, and I very much hope that this satisfactory response will continue unabated and be promoted throughout the country. In this important task of air defense, we have proven that although Britain handles this matter on a voluntary basis, the results achieved can match those of other countries, even if they cannot surpass them.</p>
<p>During the battle talk, a representative from the British Wireless Radio Corporation came to the microphone and offered the audience the recording of his speech made that day in the poisonous gas chamber. He said:</p>
<p>While we were making this recording, we were actually standing in the dense smoke of poisonous gas. We borrowed a mobile poisonous gas vehicle from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to do this description. We walked into the car through a canvas-covered, airtight passage. This kind of police car is specially used to train police officers from various departments so that they know the intricacies of gas masks and poisonous gas. I stood nervously in a corner like a Martian alien, while a police inspector prepared to ignite his handbag containing poisonous gas. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Wanping Incident Turns for the Worse</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Launches a Large-Scale Encirclement of the County Seat; Young Officers Disapprove of Troop Withdrawal; 2,000 Soldiers from the Kwantung Army Arrive at Yuguan Awaiting Advancement</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident on the 10th suddenly worsened again. News from the vicinity of Wanping and Fengtai remains unclear. The sound of artillery fire has been heard intermittently within the city of Beiping. The transportation between Tianjin was cut off at 3:00 PM on the 10th. A comprehensive report from various sources is as follows:</p>
<p>Conflict Rekindles</p>
<p>Around 2:00 AM on the 10th, over two hundred Japanese soldiers who had not withdrawn were positioned on the high ground northeast of the culvert outside the east gate of Wanping. They suddenly opened fire on our security forces inside the city with machine guns for twenty minutes. After the Japanese military advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, Nakajima, along with Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai, negotiated with the Japanese army, the Japanese side claimed that two dead Japanese soldiers had not been found and that they needed to enter the city to search. They also claimed that the security forces had fired first due to a misunderstanding, thus their actions were defensive. After 7:00 AM that morning, Japanese troops from Tongzhou and Tianjin reinforced Fengtai. The Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, about three hundred soldiers, moved towards Wulidian. Around 3:00 PM, three Japanese airplanes flew from Tianjin to the Lugouqiao, the right bank of the Yongding River, and above Wanping County, circling for reconnaissance for about twenty minutes before departing. At 5:00 PM, the Japanese troops in Fengtai continued to send a train with artillery, adding over two hundred soldiers to the front of Lugouqiao. At 5:10 PM, they launched a fierce attack on our 29th Army on the right bank of the Yongding River and the security forces inside Wanping City. The attack paused slightly around 6:00 PM, then resumed at 7:00 PM, launching a large-scale encirclement of Wanping County. The intensity of the artillery fire was greater than before. Our troops had no choice but to fight back, resulting in heavy casualties. After twenty minutes, the Japanese troops stopped their attack. At 7:30 PM, the artillery bombardment resumed, accompanied by machine gun fire and charges, all of which were resolutely repelled by our troops. After 8:00 PM, although the sound of artillery fire continued, the direction could not be distinguished due to the darkness, and the attack gradually subsided.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Assemble</p>
<p>From the 10th onwards, Japanese troops successively assembled. Troops from Tongzhou, Tangshan, Tianjin, and Tanggu were dispatched to Fengtai in batches, and then transferred from Fengtai to Lugouqiao. Their headquarters seemed to be in Fengtai, while the forward command post was in Longwangmiao, and the artillery base was in Wulidian. The Japanese troops stationed in Qinhuangdao, Yuguan, and Nandasi were concentrated in Tangshan and had requisitioned vehicles from the Beining Railway to transport them to Tangshan and Tanggu in batches, and then proceed to Fengtai by land. On the 10th, both morning and afternoon, the Japanese troops originally stationed in Tongzhou, due to their defenses being taken over by troops from Tangshan and Tanggu, dispatched over three hundred soldiers to Fengtai. The Suzuki Independent Artillery Regiment stationed in Tianjin, with over three hundred soldiers, also along with the Kayashima Infantry Second Regiment with over three hundred soldiers, took heavy trucks to Fengtai. Therefore, as of the evening of the 10th, the Japanese troops assembled in Fengtai numbered about two thousand, of which over six hundred had gone to Wulidian and Lugouqiao. Hebian, the commander of the infantry regiment stationed in Beiping, went to Wulidian to command on the afternoon of the 9th. Battalion Commander Morita was on the left bank of the Yongding River, commanding the attack on our 29th Army. Military vehicle activity became more active, and the main force of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin was preparing for an emergency deployment. If the fighting intensified, they would be dispatched to reinforce. From 6:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 10th, over two thousand soldiers from the Kwantung Army stationed in Jinzhou and Suizhong arrived at Yuguan on five trains, parked at the station, awaiting orders to advance. The pseudo-Fengshan Railway was also mobilizing vehicles to transport troops.</p>
<p>Situation Takes a Sudden Turn</p>
<p>Hashimoto, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin, met with Japanese Brigade Commander Hebian and battalion commanders Morita, Katada, and Ichiki in Fengtai on the 9th, conveying the intentions of Japanese Army Commander Tashiro. Originally, he planned to go to Beiping immediately to convene Wachi, Matsui, Imai, and others to discuss methods for handling the aftermath. Unexpectedly, young officers believed that such understanding would damage the prestige of the Imperial Army and feared that it would cause the 29th Army to despise the Japanese army, making it impossible to subdue them in the future. Therefore, they all advocated for decisive retaliation to demonstrate the might of the Imperial Army. At the same time, the Kwantung Army adopted a strong stance, urging the young officers of the Japanese army stationed in North China to take action to subdue [omission]. Therefore, Hashimoto's mission was constrained by the young officers, and he could only inspect the troops in Fengtai, comfort the wounded soldiers, and leave for Beiping in the afternoon of the 10th. The Japanese did not meet with our authorities. The Japanese army attacked Lugouqiao again, repeatedly, under the unilateral decisions of Hebian, Wachi, Matsui, Katada, and Ichiki, etc. Their actions also became more aggressive. Japanese Army Commander Tashiro had almost completely lost his ability to control his subordinates. At 11:00 PM on the night of the 10th, the Japanese Army Headquarters even issued a statement, stating that "at 5:10 PM, 7:00 PM, and 7:30 PM on the 10th, the 29th Army fired on Japanese troops at Lugouqiao and Yaomenkou with howitzers from across the river. If any major unfortunate events occur as a result, all responsibility will be borne by the Chinese side." Judging by their intentions, it seems to be shifting responsibility to our side and providing a pretext for a large-scale attack. Therefore, there is general concern here that this incident will escalate beyond control.</p>
<p>Transportation Cut Again</p>
<p>The transportation between Beiping and Tianjin, which had resumed at 7:00 AM on the 10th, with each train only able to re-enter Beiping's Qianmen Station at 7:00 AM and the first train from Beiping to Tianjin also having to depart after 7:00 AM, became tense again around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. The Yongdingmen railway tracks were once again dismantled by our troops, and the transportation between Beiping and Tianjin was interrupted again. Passenger trains heading to Beiping all turned back to Tianjin after reaching Fengtai. After 9:00 PM, even transportation between Tianjin and Fengtai was cut off. Many Japanese soldiers were crowded at Fengtai Station. The station's telephone room was guarded by Japanese soldiers. A large amount of Japanese ammunition was piled up at the station. Passengers had to undergo inspection. However, Beiping-Tianjin telephone lines remained open, although making calls was still extremely difficult. People in Tianjin became increasingly panicked. Police Chief Li Wentian convened a meeting of all branch chiefs and security team leaders at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th to discuss strict measures to maintain public order in the city, deciding on eight items, including conducting a census starting immediately and completing it within a week. Suspicious persons would be interrogated immediately. Congested residences would not be allowed to harbor idlers. Each district would liaise with each other to ensure close security. The management of lights could be ordered to be extinguished if necessary.</p>
<p>A Glimmer of Hope</p>
<p>Until the night of the 10th, Qin Dechun was still making efforts for peace, constantly consulting with Japanese special service organ officials Matsui and military attache Imai, and Second Section Chief Wachi, etc., to discuss ceasefire methods and follow-up procedures. Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai, Hebei-Chahar Political Council Advisor Nakajima, and Sakurai were all in Beiping, working hard all night to negotiate. If there is a glimmer of hope, the authorities are determined to uphold the principle of peace and friendship, turning hostility into harmony. If the other party's oppression is excessive, leaving us no room for maneuver, we will have to risk everything, even at the cost of sacrifice. It is said that on the night of the 10th, Qin Dechun conveyed this intention to the Japanese side, hoping that the other party would be warned. Chairman Feng Zhaonian is scheduled to return to Baoding early on the 11th, and Qin Dechun will be responsible for all negotiations. (12:30 AM on the 11th)</p>
<h3>A Scene of Troop Withdrawal Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Late at night on the 8th, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a new instruction to Tianjin regarding the attack on Lugouqiao by the Japanese army stationed in Fengtai. Tashiro, the Japanese army commander stationed in Tianjin, convened an emergency meeting at the commander's residence in Zhangyuan in the Japanese Concession, discussing it for a long time. After deciding on a method, he immediately telegraphed Wachi, Matsui, Imai, and others in Beiping to inform them, and ordered Oomoto, the chief of the First Section of the headquarters, along with staff officers Asai and Senda, to depart by steamship at 5:00 AM on the 9th to convey the order to the Japanese army at the front in Fengtai. At the same time, Wachi, Imai, Matsui, and others, based on Tashiro's instructions, held several talks with our officials Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, and Zhang Zizhong from about 1:00 AM on the 9th. Both sides agreed to first withdraw troops to resolve the wartime situation, and then convene a meeting to negotiate future issues. At 5:30 AM on the 9th, a five-point troop withdrawal method was finalized: the 29th Army battalion stationed in Lugouqiao would first withdraw from the city and assemble on the right bank of the Yongding River; then, three companies of soldiers would retreat to Gu'an County, and one company would remain in villages outside the city within Wanping County. The Japanese army would first retreat to Zhaoxinzhuang and, after the 29th Army had retreated to the so-called appropriate location, would completely retreat back to their original defense area in Fengtai. The defense of Lugouqiao City would be filled by three hundred men from Shi Yousan's Hebei Security Brigade. At around 1:00 AM on the 9th, while the negotiations were underway, the sound of gunfire from the Japanese army gathered outside Lugouqiao City continued intermittently. Our defending troops remained calm until 5:40 AM, when the 29th Army, based on the agreement between the two sides, sent Ho Jifeng, the commander of the 110th Brigade of the 37th Division, along with Zhou Yongye, the director of the Communications Department of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters, by car to Lugouqiao to meet with the Japanese military advisors to the 29th Army, Nakajima and Sakurai, Wanping Commissioner Wang Lengzhai, Lin Gengyu, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and the battalion commanders Morita, Katada, and Ichiki of the First and Second Battalions of the Japanese Infantry First Regiment, the deputy director of the special service organ stationed in Beiping, Terahira, and the commander of the Beiping Gendarmerie, Akato, to jointly discuss and monitor the troop withdrawal of both sides. At this time, Shi Yousan led three hundred security troops to fill the defense, driving in heavy trucks. The Japanese army mistakenly thought that reinforcements from the 29th Army in the city had arrived and opened fire. Shi's troops quickly got out of the vehicles and lay down in skirmish lines on the ground to avoid bullets, but one soldier was killed. Our troops in the city, seeing the Japanese army open fire, also mistakenly thought that the Japanese side was unwilling to withdraw troops and opened fire as well. As a result, gunfire erupted. By 8:00 AM, Oomoto, Asai, and Senda had arrived from Tianjin and participated in the negotiations. Both sides then tried their best to stop the attack. At 8:45 AM, they retreated according to the agreement. After our troops retreated to the right bank of the Yongding River to assemble, after Shi Yousan's troops entered the city to complete the deployment, one company was left in a small village near the city, and the rest retreated to Gu'an. The Japanese army first retreated to Zhaoxinzhuang, several kilometers away from Lugouqiao, and then returned to Fengtai around 10:00 AM. After 10:00 AM, the wartime situation began to ease. However, a small number of Japanese cavalry were still trying to patrol the Hun River and monitor the movements of our troops.</p>
<p>Since the troops of both sides have been withdrawn, the two sides will hold a joint meeting in Pingzhong to discuss subsequent matters. Hashimoto Gun, the chief of staff of the Japanese army stationed in North China, took a ride on the Beining passenger train with his staff officer Tsukada and the affiliated Suzuki to Ping in the afternoon of the ninth. However, because the car could only drive to Fengtai, he got off at Fengtai at about 6:00 PM and transferred to Lugouqiao to investigate the situation after the withdrawal of troops by both sides, and met with Morita, Katada, Ichiki, etc. After giving some instructions, he turned to Beiping in the evening to meet the two generals, Hebian and Mutaguchi, exchanged opinions, and then planned to call Wachi, Matsui, Imai, Asai, Senda, Oomoto, and others to hold a meeting to determine the future negotiation steps. It is said that because Wachi will be transferred to the first section chief of the Japanese army stationed in North China, he is actually the backbone staff of the main battle section of the headquarters. Hashimoto and others will respect his opinions and ask our side for compensation, condolences, and apologies. On the night of the 9th, Chinese and Japanese personnel were still negotiating in Pingzhong. Although the Japanese army had withdrawn to Fengtai, it was still making vocational preparations. On the night of the 8th, the headquarters of the Japanese army stationed in North China had repeatedly asked the Beining Road Bureau for vehicles to transport troops to Fengtai, but was rejected by the Road Bureau. On the morning of the 9th, a batch of chemical warfare troops, about two hundred people, took heavy trucks to Fengtai along the Beining Road. At 6:40 in the evening, another 30 Japanese soldiers and 8 horses escorted a train of military supplies from Nandasi to Tianjin, and transported them to Fengtai overnight in heavy trucks. The Japanese army gathered in Fengtai currently has more than 1,300 people. On the evening of the 9th, they asked the Road Bureau for vehicles to drive to Beiping, but the Road Bureau did not respond. Therefore, Beiping closed its four doors at 7:00 PM on the 9th and imposed martial law ahead of schedule. People generally do not dare to be optimistic about this situation.</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone between Tianjin and Ping was still crowded on the 9th and it was not easy to get through. Although the telegraph line was intact, there were few users. From 7:00 AM, there was heavy rain in Ping and Tianjin at the same time and it did not clear all day. The conflict between the two sides on the 9th was not so fierce, which may be due to the heavy rain. The 21st passenger train from Fengtai to Tianjin in the morning was sparsely seated. The 22nd passenger train from Tianjin to Ping at 7:00 AM also only reached Fengtai and there were not many passengers. The 42nd and 4th passenger trains from Tianjin to Ping at 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM, respectively, had the section of track near Yongdingmen that was demolished repaired at 5:00 PM on the same day. However, because Beiping temporarily advanced martial law to prevent accidents, the 42nd and 4th passenger trains still only went to Fengtai. The 3rd passenger train and the 1st through train from Ping to Shanghai were all advanced to before 6:00 PM according to the prescribed time. The Tianjin-Tangshan, Tianjin-Yuguan, Ping-Shenyang, and Tianjin-Pukou passenger trains were all changed to depart from Tianjin Station according to the schedule. The through trains that should have driven to Beiping stopped at Tianjin Station and were scheduled to depart one after another after 3:00 AM on the 10th, and arrive after Beiping lifted martial law and the city gates opened at about 7:00 AM. If there is no tension on the 10th, the transportation between Ping and Tianjin should be restored.</p>
<p>The Japanese concession here is quite nervous because they don't know where they got their information. Since the late hours of the 8th, all detectives have been dispatched to guard all important intersections, and sandbags have been piled up and electric nets have been set up in remote streets and alleys, and security posts have been added. On the morning of the 9th, the Acting Police Chief Kawatori convened an emergency meeting and decided to divide the entire concession into five districts, and the Japanese police and the Japanese volunteer team [In rural areas, soldiers] jointly divided the districts and were responsible for defense. At 1:00 PM, the Japanese Gendarmerie sent a camp to visit Li Wentian, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, requesting attention to public security in the city. Li promised to take precautions. In the afternoon, dozens of Japanese wounded soldiers from the Lugouqiao front were transported to Tianjin by train and heavy vehicles. (Midnight on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Continued Report on the Anti-Xiong Movement</p>
<p>Since the county education director was commissioned by the provincial office to bear the height of Xiong Zhugao, all circles have risen up in opposition. Now I know that the academic and educational circles of Jiangyin County have also sent a letter to Xiong, the original letter is as follows: "To Mr. Xiong Zhugao, the leader of the Education Department, how about the results of your teaching in our city for several years? Why were you driven out? Now that you have left your job and left with a full load, you can enjoy yourself for the rest of your life without worrying about being frozen or starving. Now, why do you have to go to Songjiang again, which has aroused opposition from the people of the city? The newspapers have reported this, and you can be aware of it. Even if you go with a thick face, you will only cause trouble in Songjiang as you did in Jiangyin. I hope you will rein in your horse before the cliff, it is fortunate."</p>
<p>Escaped Prisoner Captured in Shanghai</p>
<p>The notorious thief, Pei Liu, escaped from prison on December 12th of last year. It has been half a year. Recently, I learned that the criminal was hiding in Shanghai, so on the 9th of this month, the police station sent personnel to Shanghai to join the Gordon Road Patrol Room, and captured Pei and his wife, Xu, on the floor of No. 1298, Pinlang Road, in the Public Concession. Songdi Court ordered the police to go to Shanghai, submit a document, and bring the two criminals to Song and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>End of Hangzhou-Caoe Section Project</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Caoe section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has completed about one-third of the track laying project, and is now speeding up the laying in four sections to complete it by the end of the month. Most of the station ticket offices along the way have been completed, only the Xiaoshan Station ticket office started construction slightly later and needs to be completed at the beginning of next month. Because there are many rivers along the line, there are a total of 77 large and small bridges. The bridge body has already been built, and all the steel beams were erected on the 10th. However, the bridge piers of the Caoe River Bridge are limited to completion within a month, and the steel frame materials are being supplied in time. It can be completed by the middle of next month. The engineering office is now preparing to close, and will transfer the unfinished project to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau at the end of the month to continue handling it.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Opening of Scenic Area Bus</p>
<p>The Yixi long-distance bus is run by Jiangnan Company, and its business is quite developed. Now, Stationmaster Liu of the Wuxi Station, because tourists from all over come to Wuxi for sightseeing, hiring rickshaws is quite inconvenient. In order to make it easier to visit the scenic area, he plans to open a special bus for the scenic area. He has specially applied to the Nanjing General Company for approval, and a station will be opened in Huishan. It is scheduled to officially sell tickets on the 15th of this month, and the fare is 1.2 points.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>

It is now heard that the mine has agreed with the Jinpu Railway Bureau to build a railway branch line from Sanbu Township to Huajiaosi in the mine site, which is 60 Huali long, and requires 500,000 yuan. Shandazhong and the Road Bureau share the costs and have named it the Sanhua Branch Line. The Road Bureau has already started surveying, and will soon circle and purchase people's land, and is determined to start construction within this year to facilitate the transportation of the coal mine.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Strange Plane Comes to Territory to Drop Bombs</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 9th, a white-shell plane came from the sky, with obvious red markings on the wings. It then proceeded to the border between Jinjiabang and Jiejinggang in Lijiaqiao Town and dropped a bomb, which happened to be in the paddy field, so it did not explode. Some farmers reported to the 7th Squadron of the town's water police, who forwarded it to the county government, which sent personnel to conduct an on-site survey.</p>
<h3>Zhuji</h3>

<h3>Director Li Discusses the 29th Army's Determination to Defend the Territory</h3>
<p>Japanese Provocation is a Premeditated Plan; The Strength of the 29th Army is Sufficient to Cope; Qin Dechun and Others Telegraphed War Situation Yesterday Morning; The Press Will Be Invited to Report in the Coming Days</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the Japanese army replayed the old trick of Fengtai at Lugouqiao, the news has spread, and people here are all indignant and looking north, their blood boiling. The 29th Army is extremely grateful for the successive telegrams of condolences and support from all walks of life. Li Guang'an, the army's office director stationed in Shanghai, will invite the press in the coming days to report the details and express his gratitude. Yesterday morning, the office also received a telegram from Qin Dechun and others reporting the situation of our army's resistance to the Japanese army's provocation. The original text reads: "To Director Li Guang'an, the office director of the 29th Army stationed in Shanghai, Brother Guang'an, the Japanese army, with a large force of more than a thousand, more than 20 artillery pieces, and more than 30 machine guns, concentrated on Da Waya, about three miles northeast of Lugouqiao, and then launched several violent attacks on our Lugouqiao position, and seized part of the Lugou Iron Bridge, all of which were resolutely repelled by our army. The gunfight gradually subsided at 6:30 PM. Special report, Brother Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, knock on the steamer and ginseng."</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, Li Guang'an recently made a statement to reporters, saying that the spirit of the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army to be loyal and defend the country has long been known to the people of the country, and they have the determination to sacrifice. When Chairman Song took responsibility for Hebei and Chahar, all officers and soldiers had this belief. The reason why the Japanese army has always been critical of the 29th Army, creating rumors and provoking, is nothing more than for this reason. The Wanping incident this time was completely a premeditated plan by the Japanese. At first, they wanted to provoke the 29th Army to retreat with a small number of troops, and then they exerted pressure with all the forces of the North China Garrison Army. But because all failed, and at the same time, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council decided to deal with the Japanese side according to the government's instructions, there were unreasonable attacks on both of the past two days. According to various reports, in addition to the North China Garrison Army, most of the Kwantung Army has also entered the pass and concentrated on Langfang Fengtai. This kind of urgent action of continuous reinforcement is nothing but a pre-determined plan. But since our army has the determination to defend the territory and defend the country, it should spare no sacrifice under the leadership of the government and resist to the end. In terms of strength, it is sufficient to cope.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Discusses the Lugouqiao Incident's Potential for Expansion</h3>
<p>The Central Government is Determined Not to Lose Another Inch of Land; Song Zheyuan's Will is Firm and He is Willing to Swear to Defend to the Death</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence yesterday afternoon. According to the discussion of the Lugouqiao incident, I and Foreign Minister Wang and others heard about this news in Lushan, and had discussions with Chairman Chiang and others. The initial intention was that the situation would not expand and could be resolved peacefully on the spot. Unexpectedly, while the Japanese side was conducting peaceful negotiations, on the other hand, they sent the Kwantung Army to greatly reinforce it, pretending to cease fire, but actually using it as a delaying tactic. Last night and this morning, they continued to attack us. I recently received a long-distance call from Foreign Minister Wang, who observed that the war may expand. Now the central government is determined not to lose another inch of land. Song Zheyuan's will is firm. If the Japanese side continues to press, he is determined to swear to defend to the death. My trip to Guangdong is to take advantage of the summer recess of the Legislative Yuan to return to my ancestral home in Zhongshan to visit my mother and take care of private affairs. I may have to go to Qiongyai to inspect. I originally planned to leave in the coming days, but now I have to wait for news of the war in the north before I can leave. I will stay in Shanghai to wait for the ship to go south and will not return to Beijing before leaving. Sun also said that the symposiums convened by Chairman Chiang and Chairman Wang for academic experts and leaders from all walks of life will be held as usual and will not be affected by the war in the north. The government personnel who participate are designated by the Central Political Committee. The reason why the central leaders went to Lu one after another was to discuss official business separately and there was no special meeting convened, etc.</p>
<h3>Japanese Third Fleet Flagship Izumo Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Temporarily Stationed in Shanghai for Alert</p>
<p>The Japanese Third Fleet flagship Izumo, was ordered to sail to Shanghai yesterday morning (11th). It entered Songkou at 5:10 and docked at the Bund outside Edward Road at 6:00. According to Japanese news, the Izumo will temporarily prepare for stationing in Shanghai. Commander Hasegawa Kiyoshi of the Japanese First Fleet in China took the Izumo flagship from Shanghai to Qingdao last month, and then turned to Taiwan to inspect various domestic warships. The Lugouqiao incident occurred this time, and a Japanese telegram came, and the Japanese Ministry of the Navy ordered the fleet to be on alert in unison, under the pretext of protecting the bridges and people in various places. Hasegawa was ordered to return to Shanghai on the original warship, entered the port at 5:10 yesterday morning, and berthed in front of the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, the dock of the Japanese Mail Company. According to the head of Kawatani, he will stay in Shanghai temporarily. Next Thursday, there will be a new transfer order to Shanghai from the Foreign Affairs Department, and then the future trends will be decided. According to the Zilin Bao, Lieutenant General Hasegawa, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Third Fleet in Chinese waters, was ordered by the Tokyo Ministry of the Navy to return to Shanghai on his flagship from Taiwan today (Sunday). The Tokyo instruction was issued on Thursday, ordering him to take all necessary measures to protect the life and property of the Japanese Bridges along the coast and along the river in China, so the lieutenant general will probably stay in Shanghai for a certain period of time.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Invites Shanghai Financial Circles to Guangdong for Inspection</h3>
<p>Cultural and Economic Circles Especially Welcome the Visit, Wu to Fly to Lushan on the 13th to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, accompanied by Zhang Yuanruo, a member of the design committee, and Li Dachao, a section chief, to attend the 10th Anniversary Celebration of the Municipal Government and the National Congress of the China Cultural Construction Association. Having completed these matters, he is now scheduled to fly to Nanjing tomorrow morning (the 13th), and then to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang, to report on the administration of Guangdong Province and seek instructions. Mr. Li Dachao may accompany him. It is understood that one of the important tasks of Wu's visit to Shanghai this time is to solicit the Shanghai financial community to jointly invest in the development of rural construction in Guangdong Province. The current priority of Guangdong Province is the implementation of last year's rural construction plan, which requires a huge amount of funds. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency visited Mr. Li Dachao yesterday. According to him, Chairman Wu has announced the policy of Guangdong Province, whose outline is divided into politics, economy, culture, and rural areas. Among these four aspects, rural areas are particularly important. In terms of loans, the Guangdong banking sector also pays close attention to rural construction and regards it as a fundamental task. Therefore, it has organized a syndicate to prepare to invest in rural areas. The funds are expected to be 30 million yuan, so there has been no mention of borrowing from Shanghai. However, he requested that the Shanghai banking and financial circles organize an inspection team to Guangdong. Since Chairman Wu has old friendships with all circles in Shanghai, he not only specifically invites the banking sector to Guangdong, but also welcomes all sectors such as culture, rural areas, and economy to enter Guangdong for inspection and study good plans, in order to promote the new construction, he said.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Plans to Establish a Factory for Local Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>Planning a Thorough Solution to the City's Opium Problem</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee and the Municipal Police Department have recently compiled statistics on the occupations of registered opium addicts. More than 80% are workers and unemployed vagrants. Moreover, these opium addicts, due to long-term physical damage and loss of ambition, are unable to produce, which often leads to their degradation. Therefore, after being dissuaded by the authorities, they repeatedly relapse in a short period of time. If a fundamental solution is not sought, its impact on national physique, national livelihood, and social tranquility will be enormous. Recently, the Municipal Police Department has found an increase in the number of relapsed offenders as a result of its investigation. The reason is that it has failed to isolate the reformed opium addicts from the adverse environment. Even if the authorities impose severe penalties, it is not easy to change their environment and reform their minds and bodies. In view of the fact that Jiangsu Province has established opium addict vocational training factories in its anti-smoking work to solve this difficulty, which can be used as a reference, the Shanghai anti-smoking authorities have sent personnel to Nantong, Tongzhou and other places for inspection. After the inspection was completed, the details of the inspection have been reported to the Municipal Government for approval. The Municipal Authorities have started preparations to establish a factory for local opium addicts based on this report, so that the city's anti-smoking work can achieve a more thorough effect, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yu and Sun, the Two Presidents, Visited Li Liejun Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the National Government, who was recuperating quietly at the Baohua Temple in the Huochang, suddenly suffered a severe turn for the worse in his brain condition. He was admitted to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment on the 9th. His condition has been quite good in the past few days. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Central Committee Zhang Ji, Ding Chaowu, and others, all visited the hospital yesterday to express their condolences.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Strives to Work Despite Illness After the Lugouqiao Incident</h3>
<p>—Sends Huang Bodu as Representative to Beijing for Instructions—</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, the ambassador to Japan, has been receiving medical treatment daily since his otitis media relapsed recently. He is also following his doctor's advice to decline seeing guests and is recuperating quietly at his residence on Laoshenfu Road. However, after the news of the Lugouqiao Incident was received, Xu felt very distressed and his spirits suddenly rose. Although he was ill, he still strove to work, listening to information from all sides, paying attention to the development of the incident, and communicating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone every day. He also telegraphed the embassy in Tokyo, instructing everything. Xu originally intended to rush to Nanjing to discuss important matters with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in person, but due to his weak physical strength and the doctor's firm instructions, it was temporarily inappropriate for him to move. Therefore, he sent Huang Bodu, a secretary of the embassy in Japan, as a representative to Beijing to contact and request instructions. Huang originally planned to enter Beijing the night before last, but since yesterday was a regular holiday and many inconveniences would arise after arriving in Beijing, he temporarily postponed it until 1:00 AM last night when he took the night train to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union and Others Send Telegrams to Military Authorities Urging Determination to Resist and Defend the Country</h3>
<p>National Postal Workers' General Union</p>
<p>To General Song Zheyuan and General Feng Zhian in Beiping, and to all officers and soldiers: We have learned that Japanese soldiers at Lugouqiao, using the guise of military exercises, suddenly fired at our garrisoned infantry at Lugouqiao. The Japanese occupied nearby coal mines, surrounded Wanping, and deliberately provoked us. Their intentions are unpredictable. When the news came, both gods and men were outraged. We are filled with righteous indignation, awaiting orders in battle array, and have the will to serve the country and die for the nation. Generals, you are responsible for defending the territory and guarding the land. We urge you to uphold your unyielding spirit, deal with the ugly Japanese, and order your subordinates to be ready for battle, using force as a backup for seeking peace.

The National Postal Workers' General Union and the postal workers' unions in various regions respectfully submit.</p>
<p>Workers' Movement Association</p>
<p>To General Song in Laoling, General Feng in Baoding, and all the officers and soldiers on the front line: The violent Japanese have trampled on our China for a long time, forcibly occupied our territory, destroyed our sovereignty, and slaughtered our people. The aggressive acts that violate international law are too numerous to count over the years. Our Central Government and the people of the whole country, determined to exist together, have spared no effort to seek perfection and maintain peace in the Far East, enduring humiliation until now. However, the Japanese side has not recognized this and has once again staged the Lugouqiao Incident. When the news spread, our eyes were torn. Generals, you have already established a glorious reputation for annihilating the enemy in the Great Wall Resistance in the past. Today, disaster is imminent, and you should complete the great task of saving the country. We hope that you will immediately mobilize to annihilate the Japanese invaders. All members of our association vow to be ready for battle and await orders. The Shanghai Workers' Movement Association respectfully submits.</p>
<p>China Labor Association</p>
<p>The China Labor Association sent a telegram to Song Zheyuan yesterday. To Chairman Song of the Beiping-Hebei-Chahar Political Committee: We were shocked to learn that the Japanese army has once again provoked and approached Lugouqiao. Our army fought bravely to resist the enemy and vowed to defend the land to the death. Their loyal hearts and heroic deeds illuminate the world. This association respectfully represents the labor circles across the country to express our condolences and sincere greetings. We also urge you to persevere to the end, not to lose an inch of land, to bring glory to our nation, and to extinguish the flames of the strong neighbors. This association vows to be your backing.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Plans to Restore the Lanzhou-Suzhou Line</h3>
<p>The Eurasia Corporation opened the Shanghai-Xinjiang line in June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. It originally flew directly from Shanghai to Dihua, Xinjiang, in an attempt to cross Russia to Berlin in Germany, completing the grand vision of air transportation between China and Europe. However, it was suddenly blocked in September of the same year due to international political obstacles in Xinjiang. Therefore, this line was hindered and could only fly to Lanzhou, Gansu. For many years, this has been the case. Since the company was threatened by the border situation, it had no choice but to change its course and engage in reorganizing domestic air routes (the most important example is the Pinggang Air Service), while quietly waiting for the improvement of the political situation in Xinjiang and planning to resume air service. It is now learned that the company has recently decided to first carry out a plan to restore the flight between Lanzhou and Suzhou, in order to prepare for the restoration of the entire Shanghai-Xinjiang air service. Recently, Holz, the director of the flight crew, went to inspect and has already gained some clues. Therefore, the Lanzhou-Suzhou line will be restored to air service in the short term.</p>

<h3>Vocational Students of the City's Student Training Corps Held Their Outbound Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Commander Yang Relays Chairman Chiang's Speech, Acting Mayor Yu Discusses the Critical Moment of Survival</p>
<p>The outbound ceremony for vocational students of the City's Student Training Corps was held at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 11th) at the Zhongzheng Camp in West Shanghai. Participants included Commander Yang Xiaotian, the representative of the Chairman, Mayor Yu Hongjun, Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Hua Zhou and Wang Xiaolai of the Security Corps, Vice Commander Li Qiqi of the Corps, Corps Commander Luo Kelun, and more than 100 other people. After raising the flag, Commander Yang, the representative of the Chairman, led the military review ceremony. First, Chairman Li Xiangqi delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Commander Yang, the representative of the Chairman, and the awarding of graduation certificates, commemorative badges, and prizes. The ceremony was extremely grand. The speeches by Commander Yang, the representative of the Chairman, and others are recorded below.</p>
<p>Commander Yang's Speech</p>
<p>Today is the outbound ceremony for the vocational students of this corps. I am ordered by the Chairman to represent him in giving certificates and delivering a speech. I respectfully compile the Chairman's instructions to young students in recent years and read them on behalf of the Chairman. Young people are the masters of the country and should take it as their responsibility to save the world, save the country, and save the people. Young people should strengthen themselves, create human culture for the country and society. Young people should understand the responsibilities of the country and themselves, and create a country of the Three Principles of the People. Young people should understand society and develop a spirit of service. In the family, young people should be filial sons. In schools and organizations, young people should be responsible, loving, sincere, united, and unified. Young people should obey their leaders, strictly abide by discipline, and develop a spirit of collective living, decisiveness, courage, adventure, and progress. The goal of education is for the country and for the nation. If we study not to save the country and the nation, it is the same as not studying. Education is to cultivate the habits of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, to develop the habit of labor, and to promote the inherent moral culture and spirit of the nation. Although the training you have received here is short, it has a profound impact on your scholarship, self-cultivation, and life. This is the most valuable page in your life history, because this training has laid the foundation for our being human and for protecting the country. In the future, we must give full play to the spirit of training obtained from the training corps at any time and any place to fulfill our responsibilities to the country and society.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu's Speech</p>
<p>Today, I am very happy to participate in the outbound ceremony for the vocational students of this corps. At the same time, I am also extremely moved. Although the students of vocational schools only have a 40-day training period, under the hard work of all the officers, they have a considerable understanding of various basic military knowledge and have a considerable degree of spiritual cultivation. From now on, it will be easier for you to shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and saving the people. This is where I am happy. What moves me is that every time Hongjun comes to the corps headquarters, he sees our young classmates and thinks of the future hope of the country. Students, you must not forget that our country is in a period of turmoil and severe national crisis. Our responsibility is particularly important. Our country is at a critical juncture of survival. I hope that every young person will have the greatest determination. The greatest determination is to prepare for the greatest sacrifice. Students, you must know the words and deeds of the ancients in Chinese history, such as Yue Wu Mu's loyalty to the country, and Wen Tianxiang's words in prison, "Confucius said to achieve benevolence, Mencius said to take righteousness," which means that each of us should be loyal to the country and should take achieving benevolence and taking righteousness as our purpose. Now that we are in a period of severe national crisis, we want every young man and woman to have the greatest determination to sacrifice. We must look at the two words "life and death" very clearly. Life must have the meaning of life, and death must have the meaning of death, that is, death can be "as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather." After our training, we can contribute our bodies to the country. This death is valuable and as heavy as Mount Tai. Otherwise, even if we are alive, we are not as good as a dead person. People who have no meaning in life are not needed by our country. Students, you all know that there is a law of survival of the fittest. The reason why human beings can survive to this day is because of human resistance. Human beings first competed with the natural world, and then fought with wild animals. Because the strength of human beings is higher than that of wild animals, human beings have won. Until now, this struggle for survival of the fittest has progressed to the mutual struggle between people. If our young people do not know how to resist and do not understand the principle that non-resistance cannot survive, then we will inevitably be eliminated under the law of survival of the fittest. Now we are in a period of severe national crisis, how can we save the country? I hope that our young classmates must remember the solemn oath we took in front of the Premier in the past. We must not only read it every day, but we must also put it into practice. Secondly, we must strengthen our bodies and cultivate our minds in order to prepare for the greatest sacrifice in case of danger. Finally, Cai Ju and Wang Xiaolai delivered speeches, encouraging us very much.</p>
<p>Sports and Dinner</p>
<p>The City's Student Training Corps held a sports meeting the day before yesterday (the 10th). Chairman Li Xiangqi and Commander Yang Xiaotian held the opening ceremony. The sports meeting started at 7:00 AM. Except for the high jump and long jump, which were the same as the ordinary rules, most of the rest were armed competitions. The results were extremely excellent. The most tense events for the audience were the 3,000-meter armed cross-country race, the 5,000-meter bicycle cross-country race, and the tug-of-war competition, which were extremely exciting. It was not completed until 5:00 PM. Chairman Wu Tiecheng and Mayor Yu Hongjun both rushed to participate in the closing ceremony before 5:00 PM and watched the tug-of-war competition. It is said that about 300 athletes participated in the sports meeting. The prizes donated by various agencies and schools in Beijing and Shanghai were displayed on the rostrum, a dazzling array of beauty. The quantity was particularly high, setting a new record for the training sports meeting of all sessions. At 6:00 PM that day, a dinner party was held in the exercise field of the Zhongzheng Camp for the same joy. Participants included Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Mayor Yu Hongjun, Police Chief Cai Jingjun, Vice Commander Li Xiangqi of the Corps, Corps Commander Luo Kelun, and more than 8,000 officers and students. During the dinner, the guests, officials, and students enjoyed themselves very much. At the beginning of the dinner, Vice Commander Li reported on the meaning of the dinner party and detailed Chairman Wu's enthusiasm for leading national military training during his tenure as mayor and the fact that he resolutely allocated huge funds to build the Zhongzheng Camp when the city treasury was in deficit, laying the foundation for military training in the city. Finally, Chairman Wu gave a speech, roughly to encourage all the students to support the leader and revive the nation, and to explain the meaning of the naming of the Zhongzheng Camp. When Mr. Wu gave his speech, his words were passionate and his tone was loud, and the audience was excited by it. It was not until 8:00 PM that everyone dispersed happily. The prizes received from all parties at the sports meeting were awarded at the same time during yesterday's outbound ceremony.</p>
<h3>Increased Seriousness of the North China Situation Affects Shanghai-Beiping Transportation</h3>

Pan Bingchen first reported, saying, "Gentlemen, our guild is holding this oath-taking ceremony today to reject counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods. The significance of this oath and the relationship between counterfeit Manchukuo currency, smuggled goods, and our national economy and people's livelihood were thoroughly explained by me at the previous members' meeting. I believe all of you who attended have heard it, and those who did not attend have likely seen it in the newspapers. There's no need to waste time repeating it. Today, gentlemen, you have come to this meeting to take the oath on such a hot day. This is truly an excellent phenomenon in China. I hope all of you who attend will faithfully act according to the oath. First, you must never be blinded by profit and forget righteousness, bringing shame to our guild and causing your own downfall and disgrace. Second, you must persevere consistently and never slacken at any time. This is what our guild most earnestly hopes for. Today, we are also honored to have representatives from all sectors come to the meeting for guidance. Our guild is extremely grateful and requests much advice."</p>
<p>Speeches from Higher Authorities</p>

I hope you will maintain this enthusiasm and persevere consistently." (2) Cao Zhigong, representative from the Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, delivered a speech, stating, "Your guild's holding of this oath-taking ceremony today is of great significance. The relationship between counterfeit Manchukuo currency and smuggled goods is something I also need not say much about. The Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee originally wanted to ask various guilds to hold oaths, but your guild is enthusiastic and able to advocate and implement this before other guilds. It is truly admirable." (3) Yuan Hongjun, representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, stating, "Your guild's first holding of the oath-taking ceremony to reject counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods is greatly admirable. I hope that after taking the oath, members of each Zhuang will follow through to the end."</p>

<p>Under the leadership of the presidium, the managers of the 51 member Qian Zhuang families all took the following oath: "We hereby swear with utmost sincerity not to accept or give counterfeit Manchukuo currency and not to trade in smuggled goods in order to fulfill our duties as citizens.

<p>General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>Declaration of the Establishment of the Constitutional Advancement Association: The conditions that a modern country must possess are complete territory, independent sovereignty, and a sound national organization. Because we lack a good organization, we have been subjected to countless foreign invasions, contempt, and insults. Why do we lack a good organization? It is only because until recently, China had not yet embarked on the path of constitutional government. But constitutional government is by no means something that can be obtained without effort. Many modern countries have gone through long periods of revolution, bloodshed, and turmoil before embarking on the path of constitutional government. The Chinese people's demand for constitutional government has also gone through a long struggle of forty years. The Xinhai Revolution was to demand constitutional government, the Second Revolution was to demand constitutional government, and the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang after sixteen years to overthrow the rule of warlords was also only to realize constitutional government. The modern constitutional movement has finally reached the day of victory. Our domestic peace and unification have been achieved, and the national rejuvenation is beginning. After the period of military and political tutelage predetermined by the Chinese Kuomintang, the constitutional period is about to arrive. The National Government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 11, 26, to formulate a constitution and return power to the people. In this way, a new year in the history of the Republic of China will immediately begin. This future constitutional period will arrive along with the bright and happy future of the Republic of China. From then on, we will forever cleanse the national humiliation of "disorganization." Our country will be transformed into a brand new, youthful, and modern country. These are by no means empty words. We can expect at least the following things from this constitutional period: First, the people of the Republic of China will raise their heads and make China a truly democratic, of the people, by the people, and for the people republic. Second, the rights of freedom that the people of a modern country should enjoy, the Chinese people should all enjoy equally. In particular, freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, these minimum freedoms should be considered sacred and inviolable. Third, the relationship between the government and the people, and the relationship between the central government and the local governments, will be permanently established on the basis of the rule of law. The whole country will be truly united, and internal friction and conflict will be avoided forever. In short, China in the constitutional period will become a democratic, free, united, and harmonious China. After we establish democracy, freedom, unity, and harmony, we will have a solid guarantee of victory in our external resistance to aggression. But to achieve these goals, the work is not very easy. We have already paid a great price to win the constitutional government. After we have won it, we must make the greatest effort to guarantee and promote the realization of the constitutional government. At present, our efforts should be in the following areas: First, the constitution is the foundation of the constitutional government, and the constitutional government should be participated in by all the people. Therefore, the constitution must also be created by an organ that truly represents the will of the people. Therefore, we must strive to make the National Assembly a constitutional organ that truly represents the will of the people. From this National Assembly, we must also strive to create a democratic constitution that is most suitable for China's national conditions and modern needs. Second, the formulation and promulgation of the constitution is only the beginning of constitutional government. After the constitutional government begins, it must be able to guarantee the full implementation of the constitution. The government should avoid all laws and actions that conflict with the constitution. The people should regard the constitution as sacred and inviolable. The whole country, from top to bottom, must unanimously and sincerely support and abide by the new constitution. It is not easy for our country, which lacks constitutional elements, to achieve this step. This requires a long period of training, supervision, publicity, and education before it can be achieved. Third, the constitution itself, and the operation of the political structure after the establishment of the constitution, are extremely complex and very important. This requires close attention from most people and in-depth research by scholars and experts to be able to consider and improve, so that constitutional government can develop and grow under healthy conditions. The Constitutional Advancement Association is a popular organization including various parties and non-party people with the above work as its purpose, and this organization welcomes all enthusiastic patriots, law-abiding Chinese people to participate. We are now in a period of external resistance to aggression and internal construction. In this period, we need national defense construction and economic construction, but especially we need a strong and good national organization as the foundation of all construction. We believe that assisting the government and promoting constitutional government should be the most fundamental and most important work at present. Fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of the whole country, let us all participate in this important construction work, and let us all work together to build a new China of democracy, freedom, unity, and harmony. Long live the Republic of China!</p>

<p>General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>The General Assembly issued a declaration stating, "In recent years, the Shanghai Concession authorities have wantonly destroyed the Chinese New Culture Movement, and it has reached its limit. The Shanghai cultural circles, because they did not want to cause serious disputes, have exercised extreme patience and made concessions everywhere, hoping that the situation would improve and that the Concession authorities would gradually realize their mistakes and injustice. But the result of many years of patience has not only failed to make them realize their mistakes, but has instead fueled the flames of oppression. The facts of recent years can clearly prove that the Concession authorities have consistently used colonial policies to suppress cultural workers with forward-thinking and awakening consciousness, while at the same time allowing the cultural aggression of warmongers to be rampant. Films with maps of the four northeastern provinces must be censored before they can be shown. Dramas with the line 'The Northeast is ours' are banned from being performed. Even slogans such as 'Do not buy or sell smuggled goods' are not allowed to be shown. But films like 'New Land' are openly shown under the protection of public concession police. What is placed before our eyes is an ironclad fact, a fact that the Concession authorities are oppressing us, a fact that the Concession authorities are favoring the aggressors. We have now reached a point where there is no retreat, but the oppression is becoming more and more fierce. Recently, the Concession authorities have deliberately nitpicked the censorship of drama and songs, and at the same time, they have newly formulated even more harsh censorship procedures. If we do not unite and resist now and abolish their censorship rights, then in the near future, there will be no culture to speak of in the Shanghai Concessions, except for anesthetizing culture and culture that promotes imperialism. In order to fight for freedom for the entire cultural circle and to save it from destruction, we have now united various cultural groups in Shanghai to organize and implement our proposal to abolish the censorship rights of the Concessions. The censorship currently implemented by the Concession authorities is completely unreasonable and absolutely unfair. Our struggle this time is to fight for the survival and freedom of the entire Chinese cultural circle. We hope that the Central Government will immediately negotiate seriously with the Concession authorities to abolish this illegal organ in the Concessions that infringes upon China's sovereign rights. We are willing to use the power of the entire cultural circle as the government's support. We want to expand the movement and unite with all sectors of society to fight against the Concession authorities until we achieve our goal. At the same time, we must also convey our voice to the cultural circles of the world to expose the fact that the Concession authorities are oppressing the Chinese cultural movement and shielding Japanese imperialists. We will not hesitate to use the greatest determination and sacrifice to implement our proposal. We ask the national people and all those in the world who sympathize with us to stand with us on the same front and fight. With an indomitable spirit, we will surely achieve final victory!"</p>
<p>Telegram to Encourage Soldiers</p>
<p>The association also sent a telegram stating, "To the Headquarters of the 29th Army in Beiping and to all officers and soldiers at the front lines, The Japanese army is using pretexts to provoke, and the people of the whole country are extremely indignant. All of you are bravely defending the country, and the whole world is in admiration. We urge you to persevere to the end. The members of this association vow to be your backup. Founding Meeting of the Shanghai Cultural Circles Movement to Abolish the Film and Drama Censorship Rights of the Concessions."</p>

<h3>Private Smuggling of Opium Discovered Inside Bamboo Basket</h3>
<p>Weight: 53 Ounces</p>
<p>Wei Hehan, a native of Hubei residing at 214 Yanshan Road, was found carrying a bamboo basket containing 50 small packets of opium, weighing 53 ounces in total. This occurred near Yangshupu Lan Road at 9:35 PM the day before yesterday. A Chinese constable, badge number 3376, found his behavior suspicious and stopped him. When asked about the contents, Wei claimed it was clothing. However, the pungent odor of opium was unmistakable. Upon inspection, the basket was found to contain raw opium. Wei was immediately taken to the Yulin Road Police Station and detained. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan has filed a public prosecution against him on the charge of transporting opium. Constable 3376 submitted a report detailing the arrest, presented the evidence for inspection, and questioned Wei. Wei confessed that he was crossing the river from Pudong on a sampan when a man named Qiu, from his hometown, asked him to carry the bamboo basket to a certain location. Qiu works at the Xinmeihe Wharf in Pudong and was following behind him but fled when Wei was arrested. Wei claimed the 41 national currency dollars found on him were entrusted to him by fellow villagers Li Zhengcai and An Ren to take to their families in their hometown. Other statements were evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Injured After Jumping from Window to Escape Forced Marriage</h3>
<p>Wei Wenjian Accused of Depriving Freedom; Imprisoned Li Huailin's Sister at a Friend's House</p>
<p>Li Huailin, a 38-year-old teacher from Wujiang residing at No. 4 Fudeli, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, has a younger sister, Li Ruizhu, 23, who is quite attractive. Wei Wenjian, a 27-year-old bookseller (also from Wujiang), living at No. 1 Fengyuli, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, has been in love with Ruizhu and proposed marriage. However, Ruizhu and her mother opposed the marriage, and she became engaged to a man named Gao. After being rejected, Wei Wenjian lured Ruizhu to a friend's house and confined her for two days and three nights, coercing her to agree to the marriage. In desperation, Ruizhu jumped from the window and was injured. Li Huailin filed a lawsuit in the local court against Wei for deprivation of freedom. Yesterday, Judge Weng held a hearing. Wei Wenjian testified that in March of last year in Chongming, Li Ruizhu expressed her intention to marry him, and her mother and others agreed. Later, she became engaged to someone else. On the 14th of last month, he met her at the Daxin Amusement Park and invited her to ride in a car with him to his friend Cai Shunzhang's place on Fangxie Road. He pleaded with her due to considerations of face, and she agreed to the marriage. They stayed at Cai's house for two days but did not sleep together. After two days, she somehow escaped, and he chased her to a relative's house. Seeing that she was injured, he sent her to the hospital for treatment, but he did not force her, etc. Li Huailin testified that Li Ruizhu is his younger sister, 23 years old. Wei Wenjian proposed to her in Chongming, but because of the large age difference, their mother was unwilling, and his sister did not agree. Later, she became engaged to Gao. On the 14th of last month, his sister was accompanying relatives at the Daxin Amusement Park when Wei used forceful means to take her to his friend's house, confining her for two days and three nights, demanding marriage. In desperation, his sister escaped from the window, resulting in serious injuries. She was sent to Qu Zhibu Hospital, but due to lack of funds, she was discharged. She has not recovered. If he can bear the medical expenses, he does not wish to pursue the matter further, etc. The judge said that money is one thing, and the law is another. He declared the debate concluded and scheduled the verdict for the 14th.</p>

<h3>"Little Anhui" Commits All Kinds of Evil: Stealing and Extorting a Myna Bird</h3>
<p>Arrested and Awaiting Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Xianhai (also known as "Little Anhui"), a vagrant, stole a myna bird worth several tens of dollars from Shen Youzhang, a local, at the Yantian Road vegetable market at 10:00 AM on the 6th of this month. After a while, he told Shen that if Shen wanted the bird back, he would have to pay ten dollars, or it would be in danger. Shen knew he was a notorious vagrant and, fearing his violence, had no choice but to pay the ransom and redeem his beloved bird. Afterwards, he felt resentful and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Police officers arrested Chen at 371 Longshan Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he was handed over to the First Special District Court. Police attorney Li Zhishan stated that there was still a mastermind in the case at large.

<h3>An Elderly Man, Sixty-Seven, Suffering From Mental Illness Disappears</h3>
<p>Found Lying by the Road by a Vietnamese Constable; Died Despite Treatment; Family Notified</p>
<p>Gong Shengqing, a 67-year-old native of Wuxi residing at No. 3 Shide Lane, Kezalu Road in the French Concession, has suffered from mental illness for the past two years due to unfavorable circumstances. The illness comes and goes. When he is ill, his family watches him to prevent him from leaving. On the 7th of this month, his old illness recurred. At about 8:00 PM that night, he took advantage of a moment of inattention and went out alone to see the lantern show celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Municipal Government. He did not return all night. At about 10:00 AM the next morning, he was found lying on the side of Maizilu Road in the western district of the French Concession by a Vietnamese constable, badge number 173. When questioned, he was unable to speak. The constable reported the incident to the Fuxu Police Station, which sent him to Guangci Hospital. He died at 5:00 PM on the 10th despite treatment.

<h3>Appeal Debate Concluded in Bai Yushuang's Breach of Contract Case</h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 15th</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang, the "Queen of Pingju Opera" and Bengbeng Opera actress, also known as Li Guizhen, has been very popular since arriving in Shanghai, where her performances have been risqué. Her career has been extremely successful. Therefore, the Empire Theater entered into a long-term contract with her, which proved to be quite profitable. However, at the end of last year, due to a change in personal circumstances, she had a disagreement with her adoptive mother, Li Bian, and left without saying goodbye, disappearing without a trace. It has now been half a year, and her whereabouts are unknown. Zhang Juchuan, manager of the Tongyi Company, which owns the Empire Theater, believed that Bai Yushuang's contract had not yet expired. During the Lunar New Year period, the theater suffered considerable losses. Therefore, Zhang Juchuan, through Tongyi Company, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Bai Yushuang's family and Xu Peigen, director of the Pingju troupe, demanding compensation of 5,000 yuan for breach of contract and over 10,000 yuan for the business losses during the unfulfilled contract period. After the initial trial, the plaintiff's claim was rejected. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Because the Empire side was dissatisfied with the judgment, they appealed to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. After investigation, the Third Civil Division of the High Court, led by Judge Xia Quande, accompanied by judges Tong and Fan, came to the Third Court the day before yesterday morning to hold a joint hearing. Lawyers for both sides were present. The appellant requested the reversal of the original judgment and an order for the appellees to compensate the losses in full. The appellees argued that the original judgment was appropriate and requested that the original judgment be upheld and the appeal be dismissed. The court, believing that the case was clear, ordered the debate to be closed and announced that the verdict would be announced at 9:00 AM on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Yang Weinian Stabbed by Thugs on Xiexu Road</h3>
<p>Head, Back of Head, and Other Areas Most Severely Injured; Ximen Branch Investigating Perpetrators</p>
<p>Yang Weinian, a 30-year-old Cantonese man residing at No. 4 Fuhai Lane, Julada Road in the French Concession, and a young woman named Huiyu, left an amusement park at around 11:40 PM the night before last and were walking together when a thug suddenly jumped out of the darkness at a deserted location on Xiexu Road in the Chinese territory, grabbed Yang, and stabbed him more than ten times with a sharp blade. Yang, after being attacked, cried for help. He ran to the vicinity of Tiyuan Road, where a guard at station No. 57 discovered a bloodied man with knife wounds rushing towards him. The guard immediately inquired. Yang was still able to say that he had been attacked by thugs but then collapsed in pain and became unconscious. The guard immediately reported to the patrol officer, who sent the injured man to the hospital. Doctors found that Yang's head, back of the head, behind his right ear, and the back of his right hand were the most severely injured, and his condition was critical. Yesterday, the Ximen Branch, which has jurisdiction over the area, sent police to investigate the perpetrators and the whereabouts of the young woman, Huiyu, in order to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>

More and more factory workers are taking cold baths, resulting in drowning accidents due to a lack of swimming skills. At around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wang Laocha, a 30-year-old Zhejiang native working at the Meiya Silk Factory in Zhabei Baziqiao, drowned in the river behind the Dahua Farm while taking a bath due to a lack of swimming skills.

<h3>Robbery Attempt Leads to Assault</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 PM yesterday, Zhou Ahe, a peddler of Xiangyunsha silk, was arguing with a female customer near Shenjiazhai on Xietu Road about the exchange of goods. Shi Aidi (previously convicted of robbery and sentenced to two years and six months, recently released), a local thug, learned of the situation and attempted to extort Zhou. When this failed, he beat Zhou severely. Zhou ran to the Sanjiaodi Police Station to report the incident, but the police could not find Shi. Zhou went home, but after walking only a few steps, Shi suddenly chased him and slapped him in the face. Shi was about to search Zhou's body for money and goods when Yang Chuanxin, who lived nearby, saw what was happening and shouted for him to stop. Shi turned his anger on Yang and began to beat him. Police Chief Chen arrested the thug and took him back to the Xujiahui Police Station to be dealt with by the court.</p>
<h3>Gao Zengfu Sued for Adultery with a Married Woman</h3>
<p>Court Announces Trial Concluded; Verdict on the 16th</p>
<p>Ding Songren, a native of Qingpu, currently residing at No. 13 Jingye Lane, Hengfeng Road, has a wife, Lu Fuqing, who is 24 years old this year. She originally lived in their hometown, while Ding was a merchant in Shanghai and did not often return home. Unable to bear the monotony of her life alone in the countryside, Lu sneaked to Shanghai around the Duanwu Festival of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, wandering around various public places to relieve her depression. She met Gao Zengfu, a 37-year-old native of Anhui, and they quickly became intimate. They rented a small house on Dapu Road in the Nanshi District and lived together like a married couple for three years. Ding Songren searched tirelessly for his wife, hoping to find her again. Recently, Lu happened to meet Ding while buying groceries. He followed her and arrested her and Gao Zengfu, handing them over to the local court for investigation. Gao Zengfu claimed that he did not know that Lu was married and that Lu had even written a voluntary statement in the 24th year of the Republic of China as proof. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang found that Lu was not yet 20 years old at the time, so Gao Zengfu should be charged with abduction and seduction, and Lu Fuqing should be charged with adultery. Yesterday, Judge Cai questioned the parties. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yan Sun, filed a private prosecution for 676 yuan. The defendants' statements were the same as those given to the prosecutor's office. The court announced that the trial was concluded and that the verdict would be announced on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Shaanxi Inspection Team Visits Domestic Goods Factory</h3>
<p>Li Kuiyao, leader of the Sichuan Industrial and Commercial Inspection Team, led the team members yesterday afternoon to visit the main factory of Guanghutang Lao Hu Kaiwen Brush and Ink Shop. Hu Hongkai, the general manager of the shop, personally received them and showed them around each department. They took photographs and then departed. Han, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and the entire Shaanxi Provincial Commercial Inspection Team, led by Li Zhigang from the Shaanxi Provincial Office in Beijing, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to visit the various pharmaceutical production rooms of the Sino-French Pharmaceutical Factory on Daxilu Road. They were very interested in the rapid and accurate output of various new pharmaceutical machines. They particularly praised the small Rendan grinding machine designed by the pharmaceutical factory and praised the excellent quality of the Longchuren Rendan, which they said was superior to any other summer heat medicine.</p>
<h3>Kangfuduo Sales Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Zhengde Pharmaceutical Factory in this port is the most advanced pharmaceutical factory in modern times. Kangfuduo preparations produced by the factory have long been sold at home and abroad, and are delicious health products, cough remedies, and phlegm medicine. Because its main ingredients are fish oil essence and other precious nourishing ingredients, it is especially effective for physical impairment, neurasthenia, lung disease, cough, etc. Furthermore, after the famous medical experiment, the results show that Kangfuduo successfully and safely quit smoking, and has the satisfying effect of restoring health. Since the famous medical experiment announced its effectiveness last year, more than 100,000 people have been addicted to smoking in various places through this method to quit smoking. Therefore, the sales of Kangfuduo in various places are very prosperous. Recently, the government has been stricter in implementing the prohibition policy, and everyone is competing to quit smoking on their own, so the sales of Kangfuduo have increased sharply in recent days. It is reported that the pharmaceutical factory is greatly expanding to meet the needs of society.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>National Salvation and Freedom of Drama</h3>
<p>— Nai Yi</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire in Wanping rings again. The rights and wrongs of this time, and who is responsible, have been clearly told to us on the telegram, and there is no need to say more. The enemy has been deliberately pressing in North China for so long, can't we detect it at all? Now, it's just that the enemy thinks the opportunity is ripe, and adds fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>In this situation, since we failed to prevent problems before they happened, drive the enemy out of the country, and stop the enemy's aggression, if we are flustered and indecisive today when the crisis comes, and cannot deal with it properly, what will be the result? The previous examples are all before our eyes. Please feel free to look at that incident.</p>
<p>Now, we can only concentrate all our efforts to unite for national salvation, so that we can overcome the current danger, so that the Chinese nation will live forever!</p>
<p>Under the principle of concentrating strength and under the premise of consistent national salvation, the methods of our national salvation work should be multi-faceted.</p>
<p>This quickly makes people think of the "Shanghai Cultural Circles Abolish and Boundary Film and Drama Inspection Movement" that opened its founding meeting yesterday, and the several young people who were arrested in the Bund Park a few days ago for singing national salvation songs.</p>
<p>The obstacles to national salvation work in the concessions are truly endless. Political and other people's organizations do not need to be mentioned. In terms of films and dramas, we don't know how many times we have experienced and how many times we have produced evidence. Under such accumulation, the rise of the movement to abolish film and drama inspection is inevitable, and there is no need to say more about this. What is noteworthy is the reaction caused by this movement, such as being arrested for singing national salvation songs, etc. Mr. Shen Jiaqian also said this yesterday.</p>
<p>Film and drama themselves are education, and the educational power of national salvation drama. From the repeated obstructions by the concessions, a counter-proof can be obtained: At this time, the sound of gunfire in Wanping rings again, and the nationwide war of resistance against the enemy is about to start. How should we promote and develop this "carving insect skills" that has always been regarded by gentlemen as relieving sorrow and boredom?</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are launching a movement to abolish inspections; Regarding this movement, I believe that we only have the limitations of different goals, and should not have the limitations of the qualifications of participants. Because our purpose is to abolish the illegal inspection rights of the concessions, and not to test whether the participating groups have registered with the Social Bureau. On the other hand, that is to say, outside the concessions, before the illegal inspection rights of the concessions are abolished, we should widely and deeply use various forms to promote national salvation propaganda. We should not only actively perform national salvation dramas, but we should also integrate this kind of national salvation drama into the countryside and factories. Because of this, we are extremely moved by the recent announcement by the municipal government to decisively cancel the celebration program, and in addition to being moved, we can't help but regret that the canceled program happens to be a national salvation drama, because at present, the performance of national salvation drama is not for entertainment, but for education.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to hoping that there will be large-scale and widespread performances of national salvation dramas outside the concessions, we feel that the responsibility for the abolition of the inspection rights of the boundary is even greater and more urgent!</p>
<h3>Laborers</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>That pockmarked young man, quite stout, Wang Dakouzi, the recruitment committee member whose speech always carried a bit of a nasal tone, bowed his head and pondered for quite some time. Then, he hurried back and leaned close to the rickshaw puller A'Shuai's ear, whispering secretively to him again.</p>
<p>The air in the room was still so solemn and tense that you could almost hear the clear buzzing of a bluebottle fly passing by. A'Shuai—his face completely serious now, paying attention to the recruitment list in Dakouzi's hand—felt his heart itching even more. So, this time, he nodded his head uncontrollably and unhesitatingly accepted the symbol given to him by the committee member.</p>
<p>The symbol had several delicate and eye-catching Chinese characters written on it, "The Committee for Mining Production of ×× Country is Recruiting Laborers…" even A'Shuai's own name was written below. He felt another surge of happiness in his heart, raised his hand, and waved the symbol high in front of his chest, mysteriously, and then hid it again in his waistband, with a smiling face.</p>
<p>He saw that Committee Member Wang was very busy talking to others. Only when the time to leave was near did he boldly step forward and say decisively to this Committee Member Wang:</p>
<p>"Well then, I will now act according to your instructions. I will return the rickshaw in the afternoon and come back here to see you; but—don't change your mind… I have three family members, big and small,… making a living is not a joke!"</p>
<p>A'Shuai dragged the rickshaw, dragged it, and stopped the vehicle cheerfully at the entrance of a rickshaw shop. —</p>
<p>However, when he saw Boss Zhao, he deliberately put on a face of sorrow and sadness:</p>
<p>"Boss Zhao! You know that I have four family members to feed, and it's really impossible to survive by pulling this rickshaw every day… Moreover, the day before yesterday, my old mother in the Shandong countryside sent a letter saying that she is old and can no longer work… Therefore, I plan to return to my hometown the day after tomorrow and cultivate a few old fields myself… to avoid… wandering outside all my life…"</p>
<p>"Hmm… hmm…!" Boss Zhao considered for a moment and then spat out two words from his nostrils in response. Immediately afterward, his face turned red and he said, "I know, you say you can survive, but you can't; actually…! You're going to work for the ×× people, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Who said that? —My God!"</p>
<p>A'Shuai expressed his surprise with great distress.</p>
<p>"What God is there! —You can deceive others, but you can't deceive me, A'Shuai." The rickshaw shop owner pursed his uneven lips and said, "It's up to you whether you do the business or not, but I have to warn you: Wang Dakouzi and the others are not good people!…"</p>
<p>"…" Although these big words still made A'Shuai a little suspicious, he couldn't come up with any words to deny it for a moment. So, he was stunned in confusion.</p>
<p>However, Boss Zhao understood his intention even more clearly.</p>
<p>A'Shuai! I tell you, earning the money of the ×× people is not easy! You have the courage to try, so naturally I have nothing to say, but in the future… in the future, don't come back to me to ask me to rent out the rickshaw again (that is, the meaning of renting a rickshaw). He paused, "Moreover, I'm afraid that once you go, you won't be able to return here… Haven't you seen the floating corpses all over the river these days?"</p>
<p>A'Shuai's heart was pierced like a knife. After a long while, he went over and pleaded:</p>
<p>"Boss! I don't want to get rich, I really want to go back to my hometown!"</p>
<p>"Okay, go!" The boss said this and didn't try to dissuade him anymore: "Then you can return the rickshaw license to me! Hmm, hmm!…"</p>
<p>Arriving home. A'Shuai didn't say a word, didn't even go to Wang Dakouzi's place to stroll around, and went straight to sleep on the broken bed.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the night, A'Shuai had a terrible nightmare. He dreamed of a vast expanse of water, just like the familiar sea route. He was hanging the symbol that Committee Member Wang had given him and looking out at the sea when suddenly, he was surrounded by people who threw his body into the heart of the sea; he shouted, shouting with all his might…</p>
<p>Waking up, he felt a palpitation in his heart, and his body felt strangely empty. He looked alone at the dark corner, recalled the dream, and became confused again,…</p>
