<p>各位同胞、在此存亡危急的關頭、兄弟所要說的、只是幾句話、大家要說老實話、大家要負責任、論到責任、原是大家都有的、服務政府機關的各有各的責任、服務社會機關的、也各有各的責任、就政府方面來說、從前的措置如何、現在的措置如何將來應該如何的措置、這固然是很大的責任、就社會方面來說、幾年以來、人民所供給的血汗、實在不少了除了以法定的貢獻、供給國家之外還有許多的義務捐、以至娛樂捐、其於責任可謂已盡、然以之比較日本對於所謂“華北事變經費迫加預算”、一動筆就是四萬萬圓、其相去又如何呢中國歷史上有兩句最痛心的話、一是鄭國說臣偽韓延數年之命、然渠成亦秦萬世之利也、明知不能救韓之亡、而徒欲延其數年之命、這樣的以並參湯來延最後之喘息到底不是辦法、一是張悌說、吳亡之際、乃無一人死節、不亦辱乎、明知不能救吳之亡、而惟欲一死以自盡其心、然想到了自己死了之後、未死的人都要為奴為隸了、這又何能瞑目、到底不是辦法、然則不能不商量怎樣的大家負責任了、兄弟的愚見、以為大家若要负责任、則必先以大家说老实话、所谓说老實話、是心口如一、心裹怎样想、口裹這樣說、這是很要緊的、中國宋末明天曾兩次亡國、其亡國之原因、最大最舊的、在於不說老實話、必裹所想與口裹所說並不一樣、其最好方法、是自己不負責任、而看別人去怎樣負法常和的時候、拚命的指摘和、當戰的時候、拚命的指摘戰、因為和是會吃虧的、戰是會打敗仗的、最好的方法、還是自己立於無過之地、橫堅別人該死於是熊廷弼傳首九邊了、袁崇煥凌遲菜市了、此之可悲、不在其生命之斷送、而在其所有辦法在這種大家不說老實話、不負責任的空氣之中、只有隨處碰壁、除了以一死塞責之外、簡直替他想不出一條出路、宋亡將及百年、明亡將及三百年、這樣長時期的亡國之痛、已夠受了自十九世紀以來、亡人之國、不只武力、一切經濟文化、皆可為亡人之國的工具、所以國不亡則已、旣亡之後、絕無可以復存、除了波蘭、因特殊情形、亡而復存外、更無可舉之例、在大戰中、俄國敗於德國幾乎亡了、德國土國敗於協約國幾乎亡了、然足能保存、目能復興、這都是於垂亡之際、人人下了救亡圖存的决必、人人肯說老實話、和呢、是會吃虧的、就老實的承認吃虧、並日求於吃虧之後、有所以抵償、戰呢、楚會打敗仗的、就老實的承認打敗仗、敗了再打、打了再敗、敗個不已、打倒不已、終於打出一個由亡而存的局面來這種做法、無他妙巧、只是說老實話而已、這說老實話、不是等閒的、人人能說老實話、繼能人人負責任、反之、人人不說老實話、則必人人不負責任、人人不負責任的結果、除了亡國、還有那一條路、我們知道現在戰爭有强國對於弱國的戰爭、有弱國對於强國的戰爭、强國對於弱國的戰爭、利用自已力量豐富、運用迅速期以一舉而糜爛弱者、使無復戰鬥能力、弱國對於强國的戰爭自知力量不及、但是已經下了决必、就要將所能使用的心力物力完全使用、不留一點一滴、那麼自己的力量固然使盡、而强國的力量、也為之消耗、强國於是便不能不有所顧慮了、我們必須知道、强國之對於弱國、如饕餮之徙貪得無厭、如果吃着甜頭、那自然越吃越甜、永無不吃之理除非吃着了苦頭、方纔會把吃慾打了回去、所以我們若能將所能使用的心力物力、完全使用不留一點一滴、則至少至少總可使他吃些苦頭還有一層、我們也必須知道、現代戰爭不只是有形之戰、而且是無形之戰、一個强國、平日對於其他强國、雖不以兵力相見、然野心旣大、樹敵必多、其兵力已有備多力分之苦、何况除了兵力之外、還有經濟戰·商務戰·工業戰·等等無形之戰時時刻刻都在性命相搏絲亳不肯相讓、因此之故一個强國對於個弱國、為有形之戰、以消耗了兵力以至於財力、則無異對於其他强國發生了破綻使之得乘間而入、其始只是若干消耗、其終且成為致命之傷、一個强國無論如何的强法、對於此點、决不能無所顧慮的、明白了以上的意義、則可知一個弱國對於一個强國、不得已而應戰、熱度的犧牲、是萬萬不能免的、而這種熱度的犧牲、决不是白白葬送下去、純無效果的、反之、不肯犧牲犧牲而不肯熱度、則强國不但吞食得容易、而且消化得也容易、這眞便他越吃越胖、不但不因消耗而發生破綻、且將以這一個弱國為資源、更為吞食其他强國之用民、有人說道、一我們雖是弱國、但我們的力量、不可估量太高、也不可估量太低、估量太高、則將輕於嘗試、估量太低、則將卽於消沉，一這些說話、誠然是至理名言但是估量兩字、是不容易做到的、例如歐戰開始、德國原欲聚其兵力於最短期內、擊破法軍、直入巴黎、當時德國佔量自已兵力、必然可以做到、但是後來遇著比國里愛巨之抵抗、以及法國馬期河之立定陋綫、原定計劃不能達到、這是德國估量自己力量太重、法國力量太輕、以至於此、德國的軍事學、世界有名的、尚且對於估量不免有差、又如近來義大利之攻擊阿比西尼亞、當時各國的軍事觀察家、皆以為阿此西尼亞多沙漠不毛之地、而且又有雨季、届時義大利軍隊、必不能前進、然而後來義大利之進兵迅速、阿比西尼亞之一敗塗地、竟不待至雨季、一般軍事觀察家所估量的、完全錯了、由此可知估量一字、是不容易做到的、大抵一個强國對於一個弱國、用兵之始、必欲以雷霆萬鈞之力、摩碎之於一擊之下、當此之際、這一個弱國、惟有硬着頭皮、盡力掙扎、掙扎愈久、生存之希望愈多、舍此實無生路、又有人說道、我們雖是弱國、但我們是愛好和平者、如果被人侵略、將必得尊重和平者之援助、這些說話誠然也是至理名言、但是我們固然愛好和平、而和平之存在、不取决於愛好和平之志願、而取决於維持和平之力量、沒有維持和平之力量、而言愛好和平、這不是愛好和平、而是輕蔑和平、世界上固然有尊重和平的國家、但只知尊重和平、而不知拿出力量來、與其稱為和平之尊重者、毋寗稱為和平之嘲笑者、然而拿出力量來是不容易的、第一必先要我們自己拿出力量來、第二所謂路見不平拔刀相助、雖然是人類應有的道德、然就現在世界上國家民族林立的局面來說、那一個國家民族不是為自己國家民族的生存而拔刀、那一個國家民族肯為別個國家民族的生存而拔刀、除非是共同利害即使是共同利害、而權衡輕重、斟酌緩急、也大有提刀四顧、躊個滿志之餘地、由此可知一個弱國被人侵略的時候、全靠自己盡力掙扎、掙扎愈久、生存之希望愈多、舍此實無生活、於是有人說道“然則以弱敵强、豈不困難”拿破崙說字典無難字、我們說字典無易字因為知其難而說是易、那就不免隨便的說、隨便的做、說旣不老實做又不負責任、反之、知其難而說是離、知其難而仍然向着難去做、那就說是老實的說、做是負現任的做、這决心與勇氣當然增加十倍、卽使困難十倍於此、亦可將他打破、我們大家說老實話、我們大家負責任我們不掩飾、我們不推諉、我們不作高調、以引起無謂的衝動、因為這种衝動、是易於頹喪的我們不作奢想、以引起無聊的希望、因為這些希望、是易於幻滅的、綜而言之我們守着弱國的態度、我們抱定必死的决心、除非强國放下屠刀、立地成佛、不然湯誓所說、時日曷喪予及汝偕亡、便是全國同胞的一致呼聲了、（四日中央社電）</p>

<h3>英意親善空氣益見濃厚</h3>
<p>英法仍維持友誼關係　英政府政策實事求是</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相艾登日前在下議院發表演說、主張改善英意兩國關係、日昨意外長齊亞諾伯爵、乃向美國報紙訪員發表宣言加以答覆、表示贊成改善英意兩國之關係、此間負責人士、聆悉齊亞諾此項宣言之後、頗為欣悅、但以為英意兩國所希望之相互協凋、不宜使英法兩國間之友誼有所變更、則以英法友誼乃為英國政策之礎石、且為維持歐洲和平起見、英法兩國互相協調萬不可少、固未有如今日之甚者云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英意兩國首揆互通音問一事之眞實意義、英國消息靈通人士頃加以評論云、英國目的係在緩和歐洲緊張局勢、而並非另修新好、以妨害英國固有的友誼、此在意國人士則謂、依照可靠消息、意大利政府目的係欲英法兩國所成立之諒解、推及於意國、而並無離間英法兩國之意存乎其間、此外美國政界人士又就英國所採態度加以說明、謂㊀四國公約（英法德意四國前於一九三三年七月十五日所訂立）乃歐洲多數國家所明白反對、英國不願使其復活、而僅促使四國（亦卽羅迦諾公約簽字國）就西歐未來公約問題進行談話而已、㊁關於承認意國併吞阿比西尼亞一事、英國不願作為討價還價之條件、但僅欲採取實事求是之政策、而以增强國聯會之地位為最後目的云、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］關於英意兩國首揆往返信札之內容、意國負責人士拒不有所表示、各報則僅根據駐法德英三國京城訪員發來消息、作為評論資料、並指出歐洲各大國對於此事均感興趣、但並未登載何項明確消息、足資補充、意國一般人士以為此項信札往返、與其謂係英意兩國進行談判之先聲、無寗認係一種表示、而以促進兩國邦交為其目的、此在觀察家所見、英意兩國首揆信札措詞雖極謙恭、但頗空洞、并主張兩國有恢復傳統的睦誼之必要、而未說明應以何項辦法為基礎、大抵張伯倫格蘭弟二人進行談話時、對於英國承認意大利併吞阿比西尼亞一項問題定必討論及之、英意雨國日後若果進行談判、必以此項問題作為出發點而有成功之希望云、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英相張伯倫與意相墨索里尼間友好函件之交換、已引起倫敦人士之希望以為此舉當可造成英意關係中之新空氣、惟路透社探悉、雙方旣未作任何允諾、亦不討論任何詳則、報端所載之種種計劃、純為推測之詞而未有事實上根據、當七月三十日英外相艾登在下院言及地中海事後、駐英意大使格蘭第先商諸艾登而後訪問英相張伯倫、傳達意相措詞友好之來文、張伯倫旋以私人性質之親函復之、未幾墨索里尼亦報以一函、往來兩函皆以尋常友誼詞句出之、對於西亂不干沙問題、羅迦諾條約問題·阿比西尼亞問題或其他特殊問題、皆未有直接關係、惟一般人以為英意兩國總揆之互換私並函件、定可銷釋雙方疑慮、而英意政府對於英外相艾登所說明之地中海局勢、彼此觀念相同、此點亦或可於兩國總揆之交換兩件見之、按數日前艾登曾謂英國在地中海固决定保障其自己利益、但對於任何他國之利益、並無加以挑鱟之意、於是衆望任何問題皆可於羅馬與倫敦之坦率討論中解决之英國政界咸覺現有一種相當機會、可在現有之英法間密切親善關係上有所成就、如再轉以英意間關係之改善、則歐洲一般緊張空氣可期幾和矣、（中央社四日路透電）</p>
<h3>一九三八年英國造艦計劃</h3>
<p>添建大小艦艇九十餘艘　海軍機增至五百五十架</p>
<p>［倫敦］“每日電聞報”海軍訪員稱、一九三八年英國海軍造艦計劃、大約與一九三七年相同、消息靈通方面、預料將造戰鬥艦一艘至五艘、巡泮艦六艘或七艘、及相当數額之驱逐艦一濟水艇一反其他小艇、停駐航空母艦上之海軍飛機於是近四年內、將自二三○架、增至五五○架云、該訪員估計、本年抄英國正在建造中之軍艦將達六六四·○○○噸之多、此為和平時期之新記錄云、新軍艦中包括三五·○○○噸之戰鬥艦五艘、二二·○○○噸或二二·○○○噸之航空母艦五艘、自九·○○○至一○·○○○噸之巡徉艦八艘、八·○○○噸之巡洋艦五艘、五·三○○噸之巡洋艦五艘、一·八五○噸之超等驅逐艦十六艘、一·六五○噸之大驅逐艦二十四艘、五四○噸至一·五二○噸之潛水艇十八艘及快艇十二艘云、（四日海通電）</p>
<h3>不干涉僵局可望打開</h3>
<p>蘇聯態度轉緩和</p>
<p>［倫敦］路透社外交訪員探悉、蘇聯政府現願重行考慮其所抱茍非將西班牙境之志願兵連摩兵在內全行撤退、不以交戰國之權利許給西班牙國民軍領袖費朗哥將軍之態度、衆視此舉、或可以打開不干涉乏僵局而獲一解决、蘇聯之决議、以章德兩國宣布在原則上贊同撤退志願兵、用撤退至可使不干涉委員會滿意之人數為條件、不干涉委員會主席撲萊茅資勳爵今日正與主要列强之代表會商委員會下次開會日期（中央社四日路透電）</p>
<h3>敎廷否認承認西叛軍</h3>
<p>⊙梵蒂岡教廷　外傳敎廷業已承認西班牙國民軍政府、團民軍政府並已派遣埃西納瑪侯爵、為駐敎廷代辦此間負責人士、須加以否認謂教廷與國民軍政府間之關係並無變化、國民軍政府前駐教廷非正式代表焉加士、近已調任駐德大使、遺缺乃由前西班牙駐敎廷大使埃西納瑪繼任、至敎皇駐國民軍政府非正式代表、仍由多萊杜城大主敎伊多美士繼續担任、此外、敎皇前駐阿爾巴尼亞代表安德努伊蒂係因西國比爾波港被國民軍佔領之後、乃前往該處担任保護巴斯克自治邦大主教徙之和益、但並未具有外交性質、且亦並未派駐國民軍政府、其職僅係敎會代表而已云、（中央社四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>“政府同僚意見完全一致”</h3>
<p>— 雍</p>
<p>溯自九一八以來日本對我侵略。已亘六年。此六年间。旣經抗戰。亦曾交涉。要均在政府所立國策之下行之。夙為人民所共見。至此次蘆溝橋事變發生於七月七日。而十九日起蔣委員長又兩度宣言。對於和戰關頭。確立限度。闡明國策。昭示世人矣。</p>
<p>夫國家政權。托之於政府。當局旣立國策。寅僚有所秉承。在大計未决之前。勝流羣彥。正不妨各抒所見。以期其萬全。旣决之後。靖共在位。但只當竭其所長。以同赴一鵠。國勢急取。在野者旣已成見都泯。以奉身於國第之下。則政府同僚。豈至別滋疑貳。以自亂其步驟。自壞其長城。所謂“政府同僚。意見完全一致。”吾人益深信之。流言之至。中央社昨特詞而關之。亦其宜矣。</p>
<p>所謂國策。蔣委員長之宣言。歷歷可說。其尤精尤警之語。一則曰“我們只有犧牲只有抗戰。”再則曰“祇有拚民族的生命。求我們最後的勝利。”夫我為弱國。無庸諱言。以弱禦强。僅有拱手讓人與犧牲到底之二途。今茲强敵之來。征城略地。早已軼出和戰關頭之外。我旣不甘放棄。自當拚命爭存。盡抗戰之能事。國策確立。惟此一語。方趾圓覷。篤守勿渝。固無間於在朝在野之分也。</p>
<p>至就國策之立塲。以求具體之實現政府當局。籌之有數。徵調部署。應手得心。姑勿置論。而或有昧於現代智識及政治軍事者。轉以求全之切。促其顧慮之心。前席陳詞。激昂慷慨。獨居深念。繞室徬徨。於事固屬杞憂。於情猶屬可諒。今敢正言以告之曰。戰事發動。原應以最經濟之時間力量。最低度之損失。突擊敵人用獲勝利。今則我以弱國不吝周旋舉凡曠日持久。赤地千重。壯士罹鋒鏑。老弱委溝壑。人民犧牲之苦。在其他交戰塲合避之不遑者。我乃一一甘之如飴。以我疆域之遼闊。人口之衆多。資源之豐富。給養之簡單。但能赤地于里。卽足以老侵略者之大兵。但能曠日持久。卽足以糜侵略者之餉糈。師老餉糜。更何能戰。此最後勝利之說。可以證於日本甫在軍事發𨋃之始。卽行舉辦捐稅。擴大預算。而益深其信念者也。</p>
<p>國策旣已確定。當局屢有闡揚。戰事業經開幕。人民義無返顧自今日。始國人但延頸側耳。以靜俟戰報。初不必問其過程中枝枝節飾之勝負。要常竚候最後之捷音。乃日本於窮其黷武之餘。忽又旁敲側擊。似將以外交之詞。令濟軍事之力量者。在彼蓄志侵略本為主動之人。何施不可。而我則鐵律如山。大計夙決。政府同僚意見一致。全國人士誓竭忠貞望平津之焦士。無淚陳詞。對死難之同胞。吞聲欲絕。豈尚有敢違國策。逾最後之限度。捨拚命之關頭。以自甘為千古之罪人者乎。際茲民族存亡之時。僚吏同心。德音孔嘉。特申其義。以為最後勝利之左券。</p>
<h3>日本積極侵華二次追加預算</h3>
<p>總額四億一千萬元　特稅法案提出議會　近衛答議員問仍持不擴大方針</p>
<p>［東京］衆院大會今日自午後一時五十五分開會、因緊急提出華北事變特別稅法案、故議塲忽表現緊張氣象、首先决定提案十飲件後、復將產金法案等八件照委員長報告可决、又議員提案五件託交委員、二時五十分休息、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］第二次華北事件費之財源、為增加稅收及發行華北事件公債而為之籌措、其內容大致如左、</p>
<p>㊀增加稅收本年度實收額為六千六百萬圓、㊁增加稅收明年度可收三千六百萬圓、㊂華北車件公債追加發行者過三億八百萬圓、若將第一次發行之九千六百萬圓合計之、則其總額實達四億四百萬圓、茲據賀屋藏相所說明、第二次華北車件之追加預算為四億一千萬圓、其中可分為左列各項、外務省所轄者五百萬圓、陸軍省三億圓、海軍省一億圓、大藏省所轄者三百三十萬圓（公債費）、共計四億八百三十萬圓、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］政府於四日午後四時向衆院提出華北事變特別稅法案、同時發表該案理由書如左、</p>
<p>茲為籌充華北事變費之一部分起見、特設華北事變特別稅·加徵所得稅·及臨時利得稅、同時對於紅利及公債公司債利息之一部分興規定之物品、一律課以特別稅、此即提出本案之理由也云云、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］衆院大會午後績開、將稅率修正法案等五件可决後、緊急提出華北事變特別稅法案、經藏相說明後開始質疑、首由民政黨之篠原陸朗質問該案之實施期限為一年、其理由何在等語、賀屋藏相答、</p>
<p>該項課稅乃徵諸納稅力强者之直接稅、並不欲將此稅永久化、</p>
<p>其次由砂田重政氏述曰</p>
<p>華北悄勢現已擴大、為打開時局計、未知政府有無召集臨時議會之意、</p>
<p>近衛首相答</p>
<p>政府採取地方局部的解决、原不欲使局面擴大、迄今方針未變、倘實際上有擴大之勢、我方亦當堅持旣定方針、即處於極其惡劣之際、仍擬採取臨機應變之策、政府决必如此、召開臨時議會與否、此間未便說明、</p>
<p>清瀨一郎氏述曰</p>
<p>據謂此次增稅係捐款之意義、但余則嫌其為數太少、未便要求國民情緒緊張、而使各界捐款趨於合理化、當局以為若何、</p>
<p>賀屋藏相答</p>
<p>全國民衆一致團結以處事、固屬可感、但由財政上觀之、尚無竭全力以應付乏必要也河上文太郎氏問</p>
<p>此次增稅係對於所有階級之課稅、似乎迴避大衆課稅、但不幸而擴大事態之際、仍須堅持此項方針到底否、</p>
<p>賀屋藏相答</p>
<p>倘事變更趨惡化、則課稅問題或有考慮必要亦未可知、但現在之事態尚可不必竭盡全力、此次課稅因係直接稅、當不致使生活必需品高抬市價也、</p>
<p>加籐渡邊等人與藏相有所問答後、質問告畢、午後六時散會、（四日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本對華侵略違背國際公法</h3>
<p>美報均主張援引九國公約　遠東和平各國應共同負責</p>
<p>［紐約］此間輿論對日本積極侵華、均主張援引九國公約、紐約著名之鷹報發表社評云、日本以維持亞細亞和平自許、但對華侵略仍在積極推進中、九國公約為中美日共同簽字者、違犯此約卽違國際公法、故英法等國近均對日表示、遠東和平須由各國共同負責云、（四日中央社電）</p>
<h3>俄報痛斥日軍暴行</h3>
<p>津蘇領館被搗毀　俄對日决施報復</p>
<p>［莫斯科］關於日人反白俄搗毀天律蘇聯領館一事、消息報評云、“日軍閥及其白俄走狗之無恥暴行、實令全蘇人民聞之髮指，彼侵略者侮辱中國人民猶嫌未足、進而日向各方面挑戰、此次天津領館之被匪搗毀、顯由日本軍閥指便、彼等方用盡一切手段對蘇聯挑釁、彼等此種暴行、將得到蘇聯之適當答復、其作為搗亂家·挑戰者·盜匪的面目·將被烙印於整個文明世界之前也、”</p>
<p>眞理報稱、“日本軍閥佔據天津猶嫌未足、進而更有意與法兵衝突、及有組織地進攻蘇聯領事館、其時日領事館首要人員則縮頭如龜、不敢接見蘇聯領事及出席領事團會議、一面公然挑蘊釁、一面復匿不見人、此其卑劣無恥為何如、夫日本軍閥之膽敢公開虜刦中國城市、甚至租界區域、此與日帝國主義之能暢行侵略整個中國、其原因殊無二致、蓋中國民衆雖志願抵抗外虜、然其組織則尚屬不夠、而此外各資本國家之公開縱容、尤為鼓勵日本肆意屠掠有如盜匪之主因”、該報結論云、“日軍閥及其白俄匪徒、過去曾屢在蘇聯邊境挑釁、然彼等亦屢受無情的答復、彼等旣覺悟蘇聯疆土不可侵犯、今乃在其强佔的土地內、用卑劣手段洩憤於蘇聯樓關、然此種狠毒的挑釁舉動、不但不能成功、且終將遭遇適當的報復也、（三日塔斯電）</p>

<p>［柏林］蘇聯官方通訊社之報告略稱、英國已請德意兩國調解遠東糾紛、此項消息業已引起驚異、因德意兩國“以國際局勢嚴重化為利”、且德國為日本之同盟國、最近黑龍江衝突發生時、亦曾參加煽動云云、此間當局方面指稱、此項報古顯欲引起糾紛、加重現行緊張局勢、德國並非日本之“同盟國”僅與日本簽訂防共協定而已、觀於此項惡意報告、防共協定實屬必要也、德國對於遠東糾紛完全中立、對於雙方均保待友好關係、並不欲援助日本也關於黑龍江衝突德國於該地並無利益、實無參加煽動之理由、德國方面希望採取消除此項引起糾紛之報告之步聚云（四日海通電）</p>
<h3>袒護日本侵略意報情見乎辭</h3>
<p>［羅馬］意大利新聞報主筆今日發表社論、申稱遠東事件在目前不致變為國際糾紛、國際聯盟之無能為力、已不待言、英法美三國與南京東京之間、皆保持通常友好關係、同時并明顯表示、彼等决不直接或間接干預此事、蓋鑒於日外相廣田之宣言、堅决拒絕任何調停、因此遠東糾紛將純粹為一中日事件、但對各國地位政策不無影響云、（三日海通電）</p>

<h3>轟炸機和燃燒彈襲擊下都市防空準備之重要性</h3>
<p>— 驚心</p>
<p>國際道德低落，轟炸機燃燒彈等殘忍武器之使用，出諸無理性之國家，已成極平凡事什！空襲所至，一地之文化機關，行政樞紐，雄偉建築，生命財產；悉供敵人肆其無限度之蹂躪！我人痛心之餘，惟有起而謀防制之術。</p>
<p>防空設備完密之國家，足使敵方任何轟炸機盡失其轟炸效能。此點在今日之中國·尚難驟致！</p>
<p>歐戰前之倫敦，絕無所謂防本設施，敵機來犯時一籌莫展；戰爭爆發後，漸知注意；經過相當時日，防空之設施漸週；迄夫近年，敵機已無由遂期轟炸之野心矣！</p>
<p>歐戰開始，倫敦市上最初發見轟炸機來襲時市民惶張失措，為狀至慘，東奔西竄，結果仍膏敵吻！被犧牲於德機下之生命財產，不可勝計！乃至戰爭未期，市民見敵機來襲時，均能鎮靜應變，探取預定步驟，警報發出，市上卽空無人影，到處有避難之準備，防空設施，無微不至。</p>
<p>敵方慘無人道之轟炸，其目的實在擾亂民心，引起其對戰爭之恐怖，養成其怯敵心理；在此情形下，市民最低限度，須有防空智識，徒事恐怖，有損無益！執政者尤應注意防空設施，相輔並進，庶有濟也。酷愛和平之國家，平時每不注意及此，言之可慨！應知軍事準備實為和平後盾。微此則人為刀俎我為魚肉，惟有聽受宰割而已！</p>
<p>防空設施之重要，一二八後已有一部份先覺之士，加以注意。此次蘆溝事變，平津淪敵。敵方給予我人之敎訓，更形深刻！國中不乏專門學者，亟應起而組織防空研究機關；供獻政府，訓練市民；當局對此尤宣充介注意，當務所急，已不容有一刻之猶豫矣！</p>
<h3>退讓與犧牲</h3>
<p>— 唐明</p>
<p>汪主席的演講，不佞是一向極其注意的。而且，不佞也很榮幸，好幾回直接聽過他激昂慷慨帶有煽動性的演講。</p>
<p>此次汪主席從廬山回京，就發表了一篇極重要的演說詞。對於六年來的忍讓，有了極扼要的解釋，其詞如下：“我們知道日本對於中國是侵略無已的。自九一八以來，對於中國是一步一步的殺進來，而中國呢，卻是一步一步的往後退。中國為什麼一步一步的往後退呢，因為中國比較日本進步遲了六七十年，中國的國家力量，不能擋住日本的侵略。然則自從九一八以來，中國外交內政的方針，是怎樣呢？總括說來，在外交上不能擋住日本一步一步的殺進來，只能想些方法使他進得慢些，中國不能不一步一步的往後退，只能想些方法，使我們退得慢些。為什麼想慢些呢，難道想趁此偷安苟活麼，不然，我們只想趁着這慢些，騰出一些時間來，在內政上做種種準備的工作，以加强我們的抵抗力。這便是九一八以來中國外交內政的方針。”</p>
<p>接着汪主席又說明政府訂立了淞滬停戰協定，塘沽停戰協定以後精神物質兩方面建設的成功然而，這“成功”作什麼呢？汪主席說：”我們是弱國之民，我們所謂抵抗，無他內容，其內容只是犧牲，我們要使每一個並，每一塊地，都成為灰燼。不使敵人有一些得到手裏。這意義誠然是嚴酷的，然不如此，則尚有更嚴酷的隨在後頭。質而言之，我們如不犧牲，那就只有傀儡了。”就是為了使全國蕩然無餘，作最後的犧牲。</p>
<p>我們是同意犧牲的，而且，正準備着各自的武器與生命興敵並周旋。但我們的犧牲的最後，却是求生存。我們的信條，不是以退讓求生存，而是以犧牲求生存。同時，我們在此更希望政府能以六年來忍辱負重一再退讓的堅韌精神，一轉而為始終不渝的堅韌的抗戰精神。那麼，我們的抗戰，决不是困獸猶鬥的絕望的抗戰，更不是每一們人每一塊地都成為灰燼的失敗主義者的抗戰。我們是解放戰，是為建設新的國家，維持世界和平而抗戰。我們的友並遍滿了全世界的最下層！</p>
<h3>最後一課</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>七月八日的清晨，在甜睡中的宛平縣突然被一陣急迫的槍聲驚醒了。</p>
<p>—鬼子兵又在演習啦！每一個從睡夢中驚醒的人都在心頭滾過這句話。但是從去年二十九軍退到蘆溝橋來以後，鬼子兵在宛平的橫行無忌，已經是司空見慣了。自己人不爭氣，呌老百姓怨恨誰呢？名呌演習，却是荷槍實彈，荳田踏壞了，房屋被穿了洞，挨幾下槍柄，更是常有的事，但是老百姓有什麼辦法呢？心里是痛恨的，祇好關起門來坐在家里等死。</p>
<h3>走狗世界</h3>
<p>— （王枚作）</p>
<p>這時候縣城里一所小學校里，剛打着起身鈴。因為聽見那急迫的槍聲，老茶房故意用力打着鈴，好像這樣可以洩口鳥氣似的。</p>
<p>學生們都從床上跳了起來。他們都喜歡偷偷地窺看鬼子兵演習，差不多每個小學生都學會了“跪下”，“衝錄”等實習，有時就在操塲上分做甲乙兩隊，代表中國與鬼子，互相厮殺起來。</p>
<p>校長是個五十開外的學者，頭髮已斑白，但他看到自己的學生那種潛意識的愛國表演，就高興地站着觀看，點頭。</p>
<p>但是今天那些小學生齊集到高樓上去觀望鬼子演習的時候，校長跑來阻止了，他命令他們到敎堂去，今天的早操也停止了。</p>
<p>學生們都是服從校長的，像聽他們父親的敎訓一樣。他們馬上迅速地到敎堂里，坐着，一點聲音也沒有，有一種恐怖就要襲來底預感似的。</p>
<p>校長直立在教桌上，半響沒有說話，他忘了用怎樣的開始去告訴他的親愛的小學生—他昨晚上所得來的不祥的消息。</p>
<p>槍聲又一陣地響起來，每一對小眼睛都互相覷視着，他們驚異，同時也恐懼，希望校長馬上解釋給他們聽。</p>
<p>“這是最後一課了！”</p>
<p>校長用了最大的力量說出了這幾個字，但是他不能立刻接下去說，兩行清淚從眼眶里掛了下來。</p>
<p>“孩子們，這是最後一課了！”他重覆着，“昨天晚上，日本藉口走失一個兵士，要求進城檢查，……這是中國的土地，孩子們，我們能允許他們這樣幹嗎？…”</p>
<p>孩子們都靜聽着，他們注視着校長的臉，讓校長的每一個重濁的聲音投散開來。</p>
<p>“自然不能！”校長握緊了拳頭，“他們就開槍尋事了。………還用砲轟炸我們的縣城，但是我們忠勇的二十九軍已經向他們還擊，…”</p>
<p>說着，校長把壁上的地圖展開來，用手指點着宛平和蘆溝橋的地勢，一邊講解着說：“自從一九一八”事件發生，我們東四省被奪，去年又佔領了豐台，日人的野心一步步緊迫了。最近又想壓逼北平，以遂其操縱整個華北的夙願。而要壓逼北平，一定先要奪到蘆溝橋，因為蘆溝橋是北平的咽喉：要奪到蘆溝橋，又必先得宛平，因為宛平是北平咽喉的守衛者……”校長的聲音越提越高，幾乎壓過外面的槍聲，“如此，我們可以放棄宛平，放棄蘆溝橋嗎”</p>
<p>一個突然的騷動，數十張小嘴喊着同一的聲音：</p>
<p>“不能！”</p>
<p>“是的！”校長點點頭，彷彿換過一口氣來似的，“現在，我們忠勇的二十九軍立誓與橋共存共亡，同時王縣長已經傳令堅守縣城，待援軍開到後繼續抗戰。—這是中華民族的最後關頭，每一個中國人都應該參加救亡工作，所做，我說今天是最後一課了！”</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>教堂里暫時沉默着，但是彷彿有一顆要爆炸的火藥迷蔓着。校長緩緩地把地圖捲好了。</p>
<p>“我們是讀書人，自然不能上前綫去殺敵，但是後方是需要我們給那忠勇的兄弟援助的，我們立即要組織一個慰勞隊，盡我們國民一份子的責任，去慰問我們抗敵的兄弟，孩子們，誰願意參加的舉手。”</p>
<p>數不清的手掌同時舉起來，一顆堅强的心互相聯繫起來。</p>
<p>血腥的悲劇</p>
<p>這悲劇太血腥氣了！我想信我决不會忘掉，永永遠遠不會忘掉的！</p>
<p>也許是我的嗜好：我喜歡在那文明的產物上—那高高的，堅固的，汽車電車交織往來的鐵橋上，望着那黃污的黃浦江水，獨自個兒呆想一會。</p>
<p>是三十日的下午二時多些，我因為有事走過提籃橋，於是我又伏在那鐵欄干上，下望着那黃黃的江水，幾隻小船，裝滿了西瓜向東邊搖去。其實後根本不會注意這些人物，我的腦海里，裝滿了各種各樣的想頭，那天後正在呆想着那段天津電報，—那是在早報上看到的，那電報說：“在天津城內的日軍，拿了煤油，四出到各處去放火！居民有向門外逃的，那街口的日軍就用機關槍掃射！”當時，我始終不肯想信那段消息是確實的。因為，在現今二十世紀裹，尤其是那文明之邦的日本皇軍，决不會作此等原始人那麼的野蠻的獸行的！也許是傳聞失實？也許是通訊社揑造的？更也許是譯電報的譯錯的？我腦海裹正在作此等種種畸想的時候，突然的，我身後起了一陣“軋軋”的聲浪，我趕快回過頭來看一個究境。我看見一輛××的裝甲車從橋下面飛快的開上來。於是：電車停了；汽車停了；行人都恐慌急促地向橋的兩旁逃開，那裝甲車更急促地開過來了！將走盡橋面的時候，那血腥的悲劇展開了！</p>
<p>天呀！這是一個侈麼悲慘的景象呀！一個年紀約摸四十多歲的女人，已經淌臥在那裝甲車的鐵輪下的鮮血裹了！那殷紅的血還在向上冒！這時；怕事的人唯恐禍事的降及己身，早已跑開了；膽小的，也儘躲在橋角落裹不敢走出來；幾輛洋人的汽車走過，他們把頭從窗口裹伸出來看了看，隨卽冷笑了幾聲，命車夫繼續地向前開去。正當這時—那輛裝甲車想開走的時候，突然來了一個印度巡捕，他大聲地喊它停下來！誰知道那裝甲車裹的一個××兵也很快地跳了出來，他那猙獰的面目，一手拔出手槍，對着那印捕的胸口，嘴裹說着我聽不懂的話。那意思想是呌印捕讓他開走，否則他會打死他！那個印捕倒也不慌不忙的拔出手槍，打開了保險機，也拿來對着那×兵的胸口，嘴裹勇敢地說：“你開吧！我死，你也死！”果然，那××兵屈服下來了。汽車號碼讓印捕抄了下來，××兵也讓印捕帶了去！當那救護車來搬走那受傷的女人時，她已經流了更多的血了！看來大約是要死的了！</p>
<p>這時，却有許多同胞們來相帮，他們都七手八脚地來相帮搬傷者上汽車，這是咱們中國人的同情心吧？</p>
<p>當時，我想起一個故事，那故事說：‘有一個中國人罵一個印度巡捕說：“你這亡國奴’那個印度巡捕却倒很安詳的回罵那個罵他的中國同胞說：“你也差不多”！’這句話原來是侮辱我們的，我們决不肯承認這與‘亡國奴’差不多的‘差不多’三個字的！現在，却不料‘亡國奴’的印度巡捕却敢勇敢地拔出手槍向猙獰兇惡的××兵作正義的抵抗，而我們尚未作‘亡國奴’的中國人，而且所犧牲的又是自己同胞的中國人，却不敢向××兵作抗議，這是多麼地羞恥呀！然而，也會說：我們沒有武器，不能向他抵抗，那麼，擁有重兵的華北高級軍事將領們，為什麼也不敢向×兵作止義的抵抗？較之已做‘亡國奴’了的那印度巡捕，將如何呀？</p>
<p>剛才在後腦海裹猶豫不决的那段天津電訊，很快的被我决定那是確實的你想：在主權尚且自主的上海，××兵尚且如此的兇橫，視中國人性命如草芥，那在已淪陷了的平津，中國人的性命，當然更算不了什麼一會事的！</p>
<p>讀者諸位：你們不要幸運那橫死者不是你自己，也不是你的妻妹，母親，更不是你的親戚女友。你須知道！在今天，或明天，這慘酷的命運也許會降臨到你的頭上來，你的血，你的肉，决不會引起他們仁慈之心。他們是兇惡的野獸，他們是殺人不眨眼的魔王！他們要吃你的肉，還要喝你的血，誰也逃不過這悽慘的刦數，除非，我們弱者一致聯合起來，用武力來抵抗他，把他打一個死！這才有我們活的路，我們才能活下去！否則，這悽慘的命運終會有一天要降臨的！我們終會有一天給吃掉肉，吮掉血而死的！我們現在還活着，這僅是時间的遲早罷了！</p>
<p>昨天，我又走過提籃橋，那一輛輛的××裝甲車，還是如飛一般的在跑着。我，幸而避得快了一些，否則，不是要給那最前的一輛裝甲車所犧牲了嗎？</p>
<p>橋上的一個“牽黃牛”的孩子，熱心地忠告我說：“下次你得小心呀！跑得快一些的好！××人輾死人是不抵命的！昨天不是輾死了一個老太婆”？</p>
<p>我慘然地點了點頭。（金戈）</p>

<h3>Bai Chongxi Arrives in Nanjing from Guilin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Military and political figures gather at Xiaguan to welcome him. He visits Chiang Kai-shek and other high-ranking officials for extensive talks that evening. Bai's visit is to jointly face the national crisis.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Bai Chongxi departed from Guilin at 9:15 AM on the 4th, arrived in Hankou at 11:30 AM, changed to a hydroplane, and arrived in Nanjing at 5:30 PM. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Bai Chongxi arrived in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 4th, landed at the Xiaguan hydroplane airfield, and immediately went to the city to visit Chairman Chiang. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Bai Chongxi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, along with Central Committee member Li Renren, and Liu Weizhang, Li Hangshu, Liu Ren, Liu Weizhou, and others, took a special plane sent from Nanjing and departed from Guilin at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 4th despite the storm. They landed on the river surface at Xiaguan at 4:30 PM that afternoon. Military and political figures in Nanjing, including He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Wang Chonghui, Qian Dajun, Zhang Jiaao, Liang Hancao, Mai Huanzhang, and Wang Luyi, representative of President Yu, a total of ten people, all gathered at the Jinpu Railway Wharf in Xiaguan to welcome them. Those who waited at the Ming Palace airfield also went to Xiaguan when the plane flew over Nanjing. Bai looked energetic, even more heroic than in the past. After disembarking, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one to express his gratitude, and then took a car to the residence of Li Liejun in the mausoleum area to rest. At around 6:00 PM, he met with Chairman Chiang and had dinner together, talking for a long time before leaving. Other personnel who came with Bai were entertained separately by personnel dispatched by the Military Affairs Commission. According to Central News Agency reporters who spoke with Central Committee member Li Renren, Deputy Commander Bai and his colleagues came here to jointly face the national crisis. The military and civilians of Guizhou Province are determined to contribute all their strength to the country, and everything will follow the orders of the Central Government. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A reporter visited Deputy Commander Bai's residence at around 9:00 PM on the 4th to request an interview, but was informed that Bai had gone to the military academy residence to visit Chairman Chiang and had not yet returned. It is said that Bai has been away from Nanjing for nearly ten years. This time, due to the national crisis, he came to Nanjing and witnessed the rapid progress of the city's construction, and was truly overwhelmed by the changes. It was also heard that Bai expressed to others after his arrival that China's material preparations may not be as good as those of the aggressors, but the large population and vast land are definitely beyond their reach. We should be determined to sacrifice everything and vow to use our blood to exchange for the survival of our nation and country. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>⊙Guilin Bai Chongxi left the Governor's Office at 9:00 AM on the 4th by car and went to the Ertang Airfield to fly to Nanjing. Li Zongren personally saw him off. Shops and households along the way hung flags and set off firecrackers to send him off. Staff and students from Party, government, military, and school organizations, soldiers, and militias, totaling 30,000 people, lined up outside the South Gate to see him off. More than 300 high-ranking officials from Party, government, and military organizations went to the airfield to see him off. Before departure, they took a group photo together as a memento. At 10:30 AM, Bai saluted Li and shook hands with those seeing him off before boarding the plane. Accompanying Bai were Central Committee member Li Renren, Chief of Staff Li Hangshu, Senior Staff Officer Liu Weizhang, Military Academy Education Director Liu Ren, Military Advisor Huang Ruihua, Councilor Li Qiong, Staff Officer Liu Weizhou, Military Academy Instructor Ma Yufu, Secretary Min Zhida, and fifteen attendants. Due to insufficient seating on the plane from Nanjing, another plane from the province, the Guangxi, was dispatched to carry them. At 10:40 AM, the two planes took off together for the north. At the airfield, Bai told reporters that the national crisis is so severe that the whole country should launch a nationwide resistance war under the guidance of Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang's recent talks and four demands are the minimum requirements for the survival of our entire nation. This trip of mine will bring the loyalty of the people of Guangxi Province to the Central Government in resisting the enemy. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Frontline is Quiet and Uneventful</h3>
<p>Our army still holds the original positions. Traffic between Beiping and Tianjin has been restored. Qin Dechun and others arrive in Nanjing to report.</p>
<p>[Baoding] The frontline is quiet today. Our army on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines still holds the original defense positions without moving. Enemy planes come to scout from time to time, flying very high and not dropping bombs. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] This place is relatively calm. Traffic between Beiping and Tianjin, which was suspended for a week after the incident, has resumed this morning. The train departed from Tianjin Station at 8:00 AM, mostly with foreign passengers. The Tianjin Dagongbao newspaper has suspended publication from today. The English evening newspaper, which was founded just a few months ago, has also voluntarily suspended publication. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Civil Army Commander Sun Dianying came to Baoding on the morning of the 4th to visit various authorities and make reports, and returned to his defense area that evening. Also, Shi Yousan has left Baoding and is still going to the front. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] The plane arrived in Dezhou at 9:00 AM this morning and the scout returned north immediately. The Japanese troops who arrived in Yangliuqing yesterday are restoring traffic, totaling more than 200 people in twelve armored vehicles. They did not go today. (Special dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Japanese planes came to Baoding again at around 10:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, circling for about ten minutes before flying away. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Song Zheyuan sent Qin Dechun and Shi Jingting to Nanjing to report to the Central Government on the progress of the war in Beiping and Tianjin and to request instructions. Qin and others arrived in Nanjing at noon on the 4th and are scheduled to return north on the 5th. A reporter visited Qin and, according to his account, the battle in Beiping and Tianjin was unprecedentedly fierce. The 37th Division had conflicts every day since the night of July 7th. The Liu Zhensan Brigade of the 38th Division clashed with the Japanese army in Langfang on the evening of the 26th, repeatedly gaining and losing ground, and fought fiercely for three days and nights. On the 27th, our 132nd Division was advancing in Hejian Renqiu. A unit encountered the enemy in Tuanhe. The enemy bombarded and attacked with aircraft, artillery, and tanks, which was extremely fierce. Our army calmly responded, advancing without retreating, and therefore suffered heavy losses in this battle. On the 28th, there were battles in the suburbs of Beiping. The areas of Nanyuan, Xiyuan, Beiyuan, and Huangsi were all bombarded by heavy artillery and aircraft. In total, the war lasted more than twenty days, resulting in the deaths of one deputy army commander, Tong Linge, and one division commander, Zhao Dengyu, with a total of more than 5,000 officers and soldiers killed or wounded. The enemy also suffered heavy casualties. The reason for the losses in this war was that the defense line was too long and concentration was not completed. In addition, the enemy used a large number of aircraft, artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles to fight us in close combat, and our reinforcements could not arrive in time due to transportation issues, which led to Nanyuan being broken by the enemy. In the battle of Tianjin, the bloody battle lasted two days and nights, which was especially heroic, but the success fell short, which is regrettable. Generals Sun Dianying and Shi Yousan fought bravely against the enemy and have completed their deployments according to the predetermined locations. Our Chinese nation seeks to establish a foothold in today's world and only seeks a way out in resisting foreign aggression and war. This issue is a major national plan and should be quietly listened to by the government. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Japanese Military Movements Become More Busy</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Japanese troops are being transferred to the Beiping-Tianjin area in an endless stream, so the situation in North China is still extremely tense. It is reported that 2,000 Japanese soldiers arrived in Tianjin and Junliangcheng between Tanggu after the railway tracks were repaired two days ago. Yesterday, three more Japanese troop transport ships arrived in Tanggu. At that time, 500 Japanese soldiers were stationed in Tongzhou. At the same time, there are still many military vehicles on the Beining Road. After the railway tracks are repaired, they will come south immediately. It is reported that when the Beining Road tracks were damaged a few days ago, more than 50 military vehicles were stranded on the way. The number of military vehicles waiting to depart now is often double this number. The Japanese are now trying their best to restore traffic in Beiping. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>[Beiping] At 9:30 AM on the morning of the 4th, a unit of the Japanese army entered the city of Beiping, entered the city through Qianmen, and heard that they entered the city via Chang'an Street. (Tongmen News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<p>[Baoding] According to sources from Beiping, the Shi Brigade originally stationed in the city of Beiping has now safely retreated to Nankou and made contact with our troops in Chahar Province. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang's Speech</h3>
<p>“Everyone must speak the truth, and everyone must take responsibility”</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang delivered a speech on the evening of the 4th at 8:00 PM on the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "Everyone must speak the truth, and everyone must take responsibility." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, at this critical juncture of survival, what I want to say are just a few words: everyone must speak the truth, and everyone must take responsibility. Speaking of responsibility, it is something that everyone has. Those serving in government agencies each have their own responsibilities, and those serving in social organizations also each have their own responsibilities. From the government's perspective, how were things handled in the past, how are they being handled now, and how should they be handled in the future? This is certainly a great responsibility. From society's perspective, the blood and sweat provided by the people over the past few years have really been considerable. Besides the legal contributions to the country, there have also been many obligatory donations, even entertainment taxes. It can be said that they have fulfilled their responsibilities. However, compared to Japan's "forceful addition of a budget for the so-called 'North China Incident expenses'," which amounts to 400 million yen with a single stroke of the pen, what is the difference? There are two of the most heartbreaking sentences in Chinese history: one is Zheng Guo's saying that he falsely prolonged the life of Han for several years, but his success ultimately benefited Qin for generations to come. Clearly knowing that he could not save Han from its demise, he merely wanted to prolong its life for a few more years. Such a method of using ginseng soup to prolong the final gasps is ultimately not a solution. The other is Zhang Ti's saying that when Wu was about to fall, not a single person died for the cause; is this not a disgrace? Clearly knowing that he could not save Wu from its demise, he only wanted to die to fulfill his heart's desire. However, thinking that after his death, those who did not die would become slaves, how could he rest in peace? This is ultimately not a solution either. So, we must discuss how everyone can take responsibility. In my humble opinion, if everyone wants to take responsibility, then they must first speak the truth. Speaking the truth means that the heart and mouth are one; what one thinks in their heart is what one says with their mouth. This is very important. China twice fell as a nation at the end of the Song and Ming dynasties. The biggest and oldest reason for the fall of those nations was the failure to speak the truth. What they thought in their hearts was not what they said with their mouths. The best method was to not take responsibility oneself, but to watch how others would take responsibility. When it was time for peace, they desperately criticized peace; when it was time for war, they desperately criticized war, because peace would lead to losses, and war would lead to defeat. The best method was still to place oneself in a position of innocence. In any case, it was others who should die. Thus, Xiong Tingbi's head was displayed in the Nine Border Regions, and Yuan Chonghuan was executed by slow slicing in the marketplace. The tragedy of this lies not in the loss of their lives, but in the fact that all their methods, in this atmosphere where everyone did not speak the truth and did not take responsibility, only resulted in hitting walls everywhere. Besides using death to atone for their responsibilities, it was simply impossible to think of a way out for them. Nearly a hundred years have passed since the fall of the Song, and nearly three hundred years have passed since the fall of the Ming. Such a long period of national humiliation has been enough to endure. Since the 19th century, the loss of a nation has not only been through military force; all aspects of economy and culture can become tools for the loss of a nation. Therefore, once a country falls, there is absolutely no chance of recovery. Apart from Poland, which was restored due to special circumstances, there is no other example that can be cited. During the Great War, Russia was defeated by Germany and nearly fell, and Germany and Turkey were defeated by the Allied Powers and nearly fell. However, they were able to preserve themselves and are now able to revive themselves. This is all because, at the point of near demise, everyone made a firm resolution to save the nation and strive for survival, and everyone was willing to speak the truth. Peace would lead to losses, so honestly admit the losses and seek ways to compensate after the losses. War would lead to defeat, so honestly admit defeat, and fight again after defeat, and keep fighting even after repeated defeats, until a situation of survival after demise is achieved. There is no other clever trick to this; it is simply speaking the truth. This speaking the truth is not something trivial. Everyone can speak the truth, and then everyone can take responsibility. Conversely, if everyone does not speak the truth, then everyone will certainly not take responsibility. The result of everyone not taking responsibility is, apart from the loss of the nation, what other path is there? We know that there are now wars between strong countries and weak countries, and wars between weak countries and strong countries. In wars between strong countries and weak countries, the strong countries utilize their abundant strength and swift movements, aiming to annihilate the weak in one fell swoop, leaving them with no ability to fight back. In wars between weak countries and strong countries, the weak countries know that their strength is insufficient, but they have already made a firm resolution to fully utilize all the mental and material resources they can use, without leaving a single drop. Then, while their own strength is exhausted, the strength of the strong country is also consumed. Thus, the strong country cannot help but have concerns. We must know that the strong country's attitude towards the weak country is like that of a glutton, insatiable. If they taste sweetness, then naturally they will eat more and more sweetly, and there is no reason for them to stop eating, unless they taste bitterness. Only then will they suppress their desire to eat. Therefore, if we can fully utilize all the mental and material resources we can use, without leaving a single drop, then at the very least, we can make them taste some bitterness. There is another level we must also understand: modern warfare is not only a tangible war, but also an intangible war. A strong country, even if it does not confront other strong countries with military force on a daily basis, if its ambitions are great, it will inevitably create many enemies. Its military force already suffers from the pain of being prepared in many places, let alone the fact that in addition to military force, there are economic wars, commercial wars, industrial wars, etc. These intangible wars are fought with lives at stake at every moment, with not the slightest bit of compromise. Therefore, when a strong country engages in a tangible war with a weak country, consuming its military force and even its financial resources, it is no different from creating a flaw for other strong countries to exploit. What begins as a certain amount of consumption ultimately becomes a fatal wound. No matter how strong a strong country is, it cannot be without concerns about this point. Understanding the above significance, we can see that when a weak country is forced to fight a strong country, the inevitable sacrifices are absolutely unavoidable. And these inevitable sacrifices are definitely not buried in vain, without any effect. Conversely, refusing to sacrifice, or sacrificing without inevitability, then the strong country will not only swallow easily, but also digest easily. This will truly make it eat more and more, not only will it not develop flaws due to consumption, but it will also use this weak country as a resource to swallow other strong countries. Some people say, "Although we are a weak country, we must not overestimate our strength too much, nor underestimate it too much. Overestimating it will lead to recklessness, and underestimating it will lead to depression." These words are indeed words of wisdom. However, the word "estimate" is not easy to achieve. For example, at the beginning of the European War, Germany originally wanted to concentrate its forces within the shortest possible time, defeat the French army, and directly enter Paris. At that time, Germany estimated that its own military strength would definitely be able to do so. However, later, encountering the resistance of Liège in Belgium and the established line of the Marne River in France, the original plan could not be achieved. This was because Germany overestimated its own strength and underestimated France's strength, leading to this. German military science is world-renowned, yet it still inevitably made errors in estimation. Also, in the recent Italian attack on Abyssinia, military observers from various countries all believed that Abyssinia was mostly a barren desert, and there was also a rainy season. When the rainy season arrived, the Italian army would definitely not be able to advance. However, later, Italy's advance was rapid, and Abyssinia was completely defeated, not even waiting for the rainy season. The estimates of general military observers were completely wrong. From this, it can be seen that the word "estimate" is not easy to achieve. Generally speaking, when a strong country uses force against a weak country, it will definitely want to use the power of thunder to crush it in one blow. At this moment, the only thing this weak country can do is to brace itself and try its best to struggle. The longer it struggles, the more hope there is for survival. Apart from this, there is really no way to survive. Someone also said, "Although we are a weak country, we are peace-loving. If we are invaded, we will definitely receive the assistance of those who respect peace." These words are indeed words of wisdom as well. However, while we are indeed peace-loving, the existence of peace does not depend on the desire to love peace, but on the power to maintain peace. To speak of loving peace without the power to maintain peace is not loving peace, but rather despising peace. There are indeed countries in the world that respect peace, but only knowing how to respect peace without knowing how to bring out power is better called a mocker of peace than a respecter of peace. However, bringing out power is not easy. First, we must first bring out our own power. Second, the so-called "drawing a sword to help when injustice is seen on the road" is indeed a morality that humans should have. However, in the current situation of numerous countries and nations in the world, which country or nation does not draw its sword for the survival of its own country or nation? Which country or nation is willing to draw its sword for the survival of another country or nation, unless there is a common interest? Even if there is a common interest, there is still much room for pondering over the relative importance and urgency, after looking around with a raised sword. From this, it can be seen that when a weak country is invaded, it relies entirely on its own efforts to struggle. The longer it struggles, the more hope there is for survival. Apart from this, there is really no way to survive. Then someone said, "In that case, is it not difficult to fight the strong with the weak?" Napoleon said that there are no difficult words in the dictionary. We say that there are no easy words in the dictionary. Because knowing that it is difficult and saying that it is easy is bound to lead to casual talk and casual actions. Speaking is not truthful and acting is not responsible. Conversely, knowing that it is difficult and saying that it is difficult, knowing that it is difficult and still facing the difficulty, then that is speaking truthfully and acting responsibly. This determination and courage will naturally increase tenfold. Even if the difficulty is ten times greater than this, it can still be overcome. Let us all speak the truth, and let us all take responsibility. We do not conceal, we do not shirk, and we do not make grand pronouncements to incite unnecessary impulses, because this kind of impulse is prone to depression. We do not indulge in extravagant hopes to incite idle hopes, because these hopes are prone to disillusionment. In summary, we maintain the attitude of a weak country, and we hold firm to the determination to die. Unless the strong country puts down its butcher knife and becomes a Buddha on the spot, otherwise, the unanimous cry of the entire nation will be, as stated in the Oath of Tang, "When will this sun perish? I will perish with you!" (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan's Telegram Entrusts Feng Zhi'an to Act as Military Agent</h3>
<p>[Baoding] Song Zheyuan telegraphed on the 3rd: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Chairman Zeng of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, all Yuan Presidents, all ministries, committees, provincial and municipal governments, all Commanders-in-Chief, all Pacification Commissioners, all Commanders, all Army Commanders, all Division and Brigade Commanders, all Commanders are aware, all organizations and newspapers are aware. Since Zheyuan was ordered to preside over the military and political affairs of Hebei and Chahar, I have always felt the responsibility was great, working diligently day and night, originally hoping to consolidate sovereignty for North China and protect the construction of the Central Government. Therefore, I have spared no effort in maintaining Tianjin and Beijing. Unfortunately, our military preparations were incomplete, and the concentration of troops was not completed, and the Japanese had already preemptively attacked us. Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred on July 7, our 37th Division fought the Japanese for more than 20 days from Lugouqiao to the Babaoshan area. Our regimental commander, Ji Xingwen, was injured but did not retreat, and our soldiers suffered more than a thousand casualties. On the 26th, the Langfang Incident broke out again. Our 38th Division's Liu Zhenshan Brigade was stationed in the area and fought the enemy, advancing and retreating several times. Officers and soldiers suffered approximately 500 casualties. On the same day, the enemy again attacked our Guang'anmen, which was repelled by our guarding soldiers. On the 27th, our Tongzhou Anti-Rebellion River garrison was also under enemy pressure, suffering heavy casualties. On the 28th, the enemy used a large number of airplanes, tanks, and various mechanized units to attack our Nanyuan, Beiyuan, Huangsi, and Shahe. Nanyuan was the location of our military headquarters and its various units and the 3rd Regiment of the 38th Division, jointly commanded by Deputy Commander Tong Linge and Division Commander Zhao Dengyu, fighting fiercely with the enemy all day. In this battle, our officers and soldiers suffered more than 2,000 casualties. Deputy Commander Tong Linge and Division Commander Zhao Dengyu both died for their country. The garrisons in the Beiyuan and Huangsi areas were the troops of Shi Yousan and Ruan Xuanwu, suffering more than a thousand casualties. On the 29th, the enemy attacked Tianjin, and our 38th Division troops stationed in Tianjin fought the enemy for two days, suffering more than a thousand casualties. In summary, our officers and soldiers suffered approximately 5,000 casualties in various battles, and the losses of other military supplies are incalculable. The above is a brief overview of the current operations of our army, which is indeed a long-planned plan of the enemy, and also a result of Zheyuan's improper handling. I should be severely punished by the state. The military affairs of the 29th Army have now been entrusted to Division Commander Feng Zhi'an as an agent, and I have been approved by the Central Government. Zheyuan has been feeling unwell since the recent events and intends to take a leave of absence for recuperation to serve the country again. Fearing that the country does not understand the truth, I hereby report sincerely, hoping for a clear understanding. Song Zheyuan kowtows." (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Typhoon Passed Through the Capital and Entered Anhui</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Due to the passage of a typhoon through the capital city on the 4th at noon, there was a violent wind and rain, the magnitude of which has not been seen in recent years. The water accumulated in the low-lying areas of the roads, reaching several inches deep. Some telephones were cut off due to broken lines, and repairs were not completed for several hours. The wind gradually decreased by evening, but there were still showers. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the center of this typhoon crossed the capital at noon on the 4th after landing in Ningbo, Zhejiang, and reached the central part of Anhui Province at 5:00 PM. Its position was longitude 118 degrees east and latitude 32 degrees north. It is currently advancing northwest, but the wind force has slightly decreased. The provinces of Shandong and Henan and the lower reaches of the Yellow River will still be severely affected on the 5th, and the wind will gradually dissipate.

<h3>The Atmosphere of Anglo-Italian Friendship is Becoming Increasingly Thick</h3>
<p>England and France Still Maintain Friendly Relations; The British Government's Policy is Pragmatic</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in the House of Commons a few days ago, advocating the improvement of relations between Britain and Italy. Yesterday, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano issued a statement to an American newspaper reporter in response, expressing his support for improving relations between Britain and Italy. Responsible figures here were quite pleased to learn of Ciano's statement, but believe that the mutual coordination hoped for by Britain and Italy should not cause any change in the friendship between Britain and France, because British-French friendship is the cornerstone of British policy. Moreover, for the sake of maintaining European peace, mutual coordination between Britain and France is indispensable, and there has never been a time like today. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the true significance of the exchange of messages between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, well-informed British sources recently commented that Britain's purpose is to ease the tense situation in Europe, and not to create new friendships that would harm Britain's inherent friendships. Italian sources said that, according to reliable sources, the Italian government's purpose is to extend the understanding reached by Britain and France to Italy, and there is no intention of alienating Britain and France. In addition, American political figures also explained the attitude adopted by Britain, saying: (1) The Four-Power Pact (signed by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy on July 15, 1933) is clearly opposed by most European countries. Britain does not want to revive it, but only to urge the four countries (also the signatories of the Locarno Treaty) to conduct talks on the future treaty of Western Europe. (2) Regarding the recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, Britain does not want to use it as a bargaining chip, but only wants to adopt a pragmatic policy, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the position of the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the content of the exchange of letters between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, Italian responsible figures refused to express anything. Newspapers only use news from reporters stationed in the capitals of France, Germany, and Britain as commentary material, and point out that major European countries are interested in this matter, but no clear news is published that is sufficient to supplement it. The general Italian public believes that this exchange of letters is not so much a prelude to negotiations between Britain and Italy, as it is a kind of expression, with the purpose of promoting friendly relations between the two countries. In the eyes of observers, although the wording of the letters between the British and Italian Prime Ministers is extremely humble, it is quite empty, and it is advocated that the two countries have the need to restore traditional friendship, but it is not stated on what basis this should be done. It is generally believed that when Chamberlain and Grandi talk, the issue of British recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will definitely be discussed, and if Britain and Italy conduct negotiations in the future, they must use this issue as a starting point in order to have a hope of success. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] The exchange of friendly letters between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has aroused hopes in London that this move may create a new atmosphere in Anglo-Italian relations. However, Reuters has learned that neither side has made any promises nor discussed any details. The various plans reported in the press are purely speculative and have no factual basis. When British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke in the House of Commons on July 30 regarding the Mediterranean situation, Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi first consulted with Eden and then visited British Prime Minister Chamberlain, conveying a friendly message from the Italian Prime Minister. Chamberlain then replied with a personal friendly letter, and soon Mussolini also responded with a letter. Both letters were expressed in ordinary friendly terms and had no direct relationship to the Spanish Civil War, the Locarno Treaty, Abyssinia, or other specific issues. However, it is generally believed that the exchange of private letters between the Prime Ministers of Britain and Italy can dispel mutual doubts, and the British and Italian governments have the same views on the Mediterranean situation explained by British Foreign Secretary Eden. This point may also be seen in the exchange of two letters between the Prime Ministers of the two countries. According to reports, Eden said a few days ago that Britain is determined to protect its own interests in the Mediterranean, but has no intention of provoking the interests of any other country. Therefore, it is hoped that any issues can be resolved through frank discussions in Rome and London. British political circles generally feel that there is now a considerable opportunity to achieve something on the basis of the existing close friendship between Britain and France. If this is then transferred to the improvement of relations between Britain and Italy, the general tense atmosphere in Europe can be expected to ease. (Central News Agency, 4th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The 1938 British Shipbuilding Plan</h3>
<p>Adding More Than Ninety Ships of Various Sizes; Naval Aircraft to Increase to 550</p>
<p>[London] The naval reporter for the "Daily Telegraph" stated that the British Navy's shipbuilding plan for 1938 is roughly the same as in 1937. Well-informed sources expect that one to five battleships, six or seven cruisers, and a considerable number of destroyers, submarines, and other small boats will be built. The number of naval aircraft stationed on aircraft carriers will increase from 230 to 550 in the next four years. The reporter estimated that the number of warships currently being built by Britain this year will reach 664,000 tons, which is a new record in peacetime. The new warships include five 35,000-ton battleships, five 22,000-ton or 23,000-ton aircraft carriers, eight 9,000-ton to 10,000-ton cruisers, five 8,000-ton cruisers, five 5,300-ton cruisers, sixteen 1,850-ton super destroyers, twenty-four 1,650-ton large destroyers, eighteen 540-ton to 1,520-ton submarines, and twelve speedboats.

<h3>The Stalemate of Non-Intervention is Expected to Be Broken</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's Attitude is Becoming More Moderate</p>
<p>[London] Reuters diplomatic reporter has learned that the Soviet government is now willing to reconsider its attitude that it will not grant the belligerent rights to Spanish Nationalist leader General Franco unless all volunteers, including the Moorish troops in Spain, are withdrawn. It is widely believed that this move may break the stalemate of non-intervention and achieve a resolution. The Soviet Union's decision is based on the announcement by Germany and Poland that they agree in principle to withdraw volunteers, conditioned on the withdrawal of a number sufficient to satisfy the Non-Intervention Committee. The Chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, Lord Plymouth, is currently consulting with representatives of major powers on the date of the next meeting of the committee.

<h3>The Vatican Denies Recognition of the Spanish Rebels</h3>
<p>⊙Vatican City: It is rumored that the Vatican has already recognized the Spanish Nationalist government, and the Nationalist government has dispatched Marquis de Essina to be its representative to the Vatican. Responsible figures here must deny this, saying that there has been no change in the relationship between the Vatican and the Nationalist government. The former unofficial representative of the Nationalist government to the Vatican, Anjias, has recently been transferred to the post of Ambassador to Germany. The vacancy has been filled by the former Spanish Ambassador to the Vatican, Essina. As for the Pope's unofficial representative to the Nationalist government, the Archbishop of Toledo, Edomes, continues to serve. In addition, Pope’s former representative to Albania, Anderinuitti, went to the port of Bilbao in Spain after it was occupied by the Nationalist forces to protect the interests of the Basque autonomous region and its archbishop, but he did not have diplomatic status, and he was not stationed in the Nationalist government. His role was only as a representative of the church. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Intention to Build a Highway in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Highway from Addis Ababa to the Red Sea Coast Officially Opens</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian government has recently constructed a wide highway in Abyssinia, stretching 1,200 kilometers from Addis Ababa to Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, and the port of Massawa. The highway was originally completed in June of this year, but due to the onset of the rainy season, the authorities took the opportunity to test the road's durability during the heavy rains. After considerable improvements, the official opening ceremony was finally held on the first of this month. On that day, two fleets of cargo trucks departed simultaneously from Addis Ababa and Asmara. In addition, a route from Asmara to Gondar in northern Abyssinia, passing through the Lasta region of the Tafari River, has also recently opened to traffic. More than sixty cargo trucks travel back and forth daily, making for a thriving business. (Central News Agency, Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Jewish Congress</h3>
<p>Opens in Switzerland</p>
<p>⊙Zurich, Switzerland The 20th Zionist Congress opened here last night, with over 600 representatives from various locations. The congress immediately discussed the Palestine issue and the report submitted by the British Royal Commission. Congress Chairman Weizmann also read a letter from British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, stating, "We will study the results of your deliberations with the utmost attention, and we hope that your congress will create peace, prosperity, and a sound administrative system for Palestine." Weizmann then provided an account of the various events that had occurred in Palestine last year, saying, "Many Jewish residents died in the disturbances, but we remained calm and maintained our daily lives. The report submitted by the Royal Commission, while being the most valuable document on Zionism, unfortunately contains fundamental errors, namely, the so-called current mandate system cannot be continued. The Royal Commission's conclusion was likely influenced by the turbulent atmosphere at the time. In reality, the mandate system can still be implemented, and there should be no restrictions on the immigration of Jews to Palestine." (Central News Agency, Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Expresses No Intention to Stabilize Currency Value</h3>
<p>International Situation Changes Rapidly; Adjusting the Monetary System Is Not Appropriate; Leith-Ross to Visit the United States</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt wrote to Senator Thomas, expressing "complete sympathy with Thomas's proposal to stabilize the dollar and control agricultural product prices." The letter was released by Thomas today and read to the Senate Agriculture Committee. In the letter, the President stated, "The United States is still seeking to establish a currency that will not change its purchasing power and debt value after thirty years. However, now is not the time for strict stabilization, as the international situation is changing rapidly, and strict stabilization by the United States would be quite dangerous." At the same time, Thomas also released a letter from Federal Reserve Chairman Eccles, stating that the Federal Reserve shares the ultimate goal of promoting economic stability. According to Thomas's proposal, a federal agency would be established to control currency prices and raise commodity prices to the average price of 1926. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Danger on the Western Zhejiang Seawall</h3>
<p>Seawall Damaged in Multiple Places by Giant Waves; Large Numbers of Laborers Hired to Rescue; City Nearly Flooded</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] On the morning of the 3rd, a hurricane-fueled tidal surge struck the western Zhejiang seawall, destroying the earthen seawall, the surface of the Haiyan highway, and the bus station, disrupting traffic. The Hangping Section Engineering Office, in conjunction with the county government, dispatched workers to rescue the situation. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 3rd, the wind and waves remained extremely fierce. The soil attached to the seawall outside the east gate of Haiyan was washed into a pool, and a section of the highway, about 30 meters long, was also washed away. In addition, about 50 meters of the stone seawall with the "Tenan" and other characters in the fourth district collapsed. Fortunately, the earthen seawall was still blocking the tide, preventing a major disaster. The top layer of the "Wei Wu" character firewood seawall was swept away by the giant waves, and the soil attached to the "Xi Yin" character sloping stone seawall and other Tan Shui projects was also washed away, creating an extremely dangerous situation. The Hangping Engineering Office is supervising the engineering team, together with the local government, to hire a large number of laborers to rescue the situation and ensure safety.

<p>[Hangzhou] The continuous gale and torrential rain have now subsided slightly. Near Wangjiabu above Yuhang on the Hanghui Road, the water level has risen four to five feet, and traffic has been suspended.

<p>[Hangzhou] This morning, the hurricane seems to have left Zhejiang and moved elsewhere. The wind force has gradually weakened. The Qiantang River ferry resumed normal operations at 5:00 AM. Passengers and merchants traveling on the Huhang and Zhegan Roads, who had been stranded on both the north and south banks, crowded to cross the river. Additional ferries were added, and it is estimated that more than 30,000 passengers crossed the river in the morning and afternoon. All small steamers have resumed service. However, around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when the wind and waves on the Qiantang River were at their peak, a cargo ship capsized near the south bank, resulting in significant losses.

He smiled often, and the children sat on the ground in a circle. The King sat in the middle, singing with the children. He then watched the children play a special ball game. When a child fell at the King's feet while fighting for the ball, the King quickly moved out of the way. Afterwards, he ate with the children. He then placed a hat in the children's name and drew one. The child drawn gave a speech, with a two-minute time limit. A gunshot was fired to indicate when they should stop.

<h3>Mayor of Nanjing Ma Chaojun Speaks on the Issue of Self-Defense and Resistance</h3>
<p>Exhorts City Government Employees to Assist the Front Lines in Uniting to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The city government held Premier Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Week at 8:00 AM yesterday, attended by all employees and presided over by Mayor Ma. After leading the ceremony, he delivered a speech on the issue of self-defense and resistance, stating: "Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Beiping and Tianjin have fallen one after another. Beiping is our country's hometown for hundreds of years, and Tianjin is our country's only important town in the north. We are deeply saddened on the one hand, and extremely excited on the other. All the soldiers of the 29th Army were able to rise up in unison, holding a determined resolve to bravely resist. In particular, the martyrdom of Generals Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu can shake the earth and make the ghosts cry. We are deeply moved by this spirit and can foresee that China will be able to revive. As for Japan, since the Sino-Japanese War, it has had the intention of destroying China. Primary schools constantly instilled knowledge on how to destroy China. The Russo-Japanese War, which was fought on Chinese territory, set an unprecedented record in world history. More recently, Japan has seized the privileges of the three northeastern provinces, further proving Japan's ambition to invade China. Premier Sun Yat-sen often told us that Japan's invasion of China is not accidental. The northeast and northwest routes are the most dangerous. Unfortunately, his words have come true. Japan is using a policy of encroachment, gradually advancing. If China does not resist, the invasion will never end. In recent years, our country has been working hard on construction. Japan, seeing that it will be unable to invade once our country is completed, has been constantly plotting to slander and undermine the development of our country's construction and prevent our country from moving forward. A country that takes advantage of others' dangers cannot be held accountable with righteousness. However, since the Japanese army invaded Tianjin, its atrocities of killing the innocent and destroying culture are unheard of in all countries of the world. This barbaric act will not only fail to reduce our courage to resist, but will only demean its international standing. At the same time, the Japanese warlords are acting arbitrarily, war-loving in nature, and destroying peace in the Far East,妄想妄想以武力併吞中國, Our only choice for self-defense is to unite and rise up to resist aggression, making the final sacrifice to seek the survival of the nation. The tyranny of the Japanese warlords will eventually lead to their own destruction. Although we are now a weak country, if we can resist to the end, we will surely achieve final victory. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly told us that we have reached the final moment. Only sacrifice can lead to survival. The colleagues of this government have the responsibility to maintain the capital, and I am confident that everyone can be a member of the national revolution and can embrace the determination to sacrifice themselves. There are five hopes for everyone: ㊀ We are still in the rear, and we should work hard to step up preparations. ㊁ When things happen, remain calm and deal with them, and do not panic. ㊂ Lead the people to maintain social order, such as stabilizing prices and stabilizing finance. ㊃ Prevent traitors and conduct strict reconnaissance. ㊄ Guide the people to engage in air defense. In short, those of us in the rear should establish close contact with the front lines, invigorate our spirits, and assist the front lines in resisting aggression. Be like wartime in peacetime and like peacetime in wartime, and calmly deal with the situation in order to overcome the difficulties and achieve final victory. Now the morale of the people is very high. There is only one goal for the whole country, which is to resist aggression and save the country. As for temporary or partial setbacks, they will not discourage our spirit. We should continue to work hard, persevere, and continue to struggle, implement Chairman Wang Jingwei's call to resist aggression, and under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, save the future crisis and permanently protect the safety of the nation."</p>
<h3>Gao Junting's Troops Pledge Allegiance</h3>
<p>Contacting the Garrison Commander Liu Mao'en; Concentrating and Awaiting Orders to be the Vanguard in Killing the Enemy</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The remnants of bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have been actively suppressed by the National Army in recent years. The border area between Anhui and Zhejiang has long been cleared, and the area between Anhui and Jiangxi is also completely stable. As for the areas near Henan and Hubei, after being supervised and suppressed by Wei Lihuang, the Director of the Border Region of the Three Provinces, the scattered remnants of bandits who were hiding in various places have been eliminated one after another. The bandit troops of Gao Junting, which had a larger number of people and guns, have recently pledged allegiance to Liu Mao'en, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eleventh Route Army stationed in the Anhui border. The troops, numbering more than 2,000, have voluntarily abolished all illegal organizations and expressed their willingness to concentrate and await orders to be the vanguard in killing the enemy. After Liu carefully investigated and confirmed that the bandit's move was indeed sincere, but because he was responsible for suppressing the bandits, it was not appropriate to accept their surrender hastily, he went from Lu'an via Hefei to Wuhu and then to Nanjing on the 2nd to ask the military authorities for instructions. The remnants of bandits in the border areas of the three provinces, which have been causing trouble for many years, can now be completely eliminated. (August 3rd)</p>

<h3>"Government Colleagues Have Completely Unified Opinions"</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's aggression against us has lasted for six years. During these six years, we have both resisted and negotiated. These actions have consistently been conducted under the national policies established by the government, which has always been clear to the people. As for the Lugouqiao Incident that occurred on July 7th this time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek again declared twice from the 19th onwards, establishing the limits and clarifying national policies regarding the critical juncture of war and peace, thereby announcing them to the world.</p>
<p>The power of the state is entrusted to the government. Since the authorities have established national policies, the officials should abide by them. Before the major plans are decided, the outstanding talents can express their opinions freely to ensure perfection. Once a decision is made, everyone in their position should diligently perform their duties and devote their talents to a common goal. In this critical state of the nation, those who are out of office have already abandoned their personal opinions to dedicate themselves to the country’s difficulties. How could government colleagues harbor doubts or dissent, disrupting their steps and undermining their strength? The saying "Government colleagues have completely unified opinions" is something we deeply believe in. The spread of rumors was specifically addressed and refuted by the Central News Agency yesterday, which is appropriate.</p>
<p>The so-called national policy, as declared by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is vivid and clear. The most insightful and警醒 words are: "We only have sacrifice and resistance," and "Only by risking the lives of the nation can we seek our final victory." It is undeniable that we are a weak nation. When a weak nation confronts a strong one, there are only two paths: surrendering or resisting to the end. Now that the strong enemy has come, conquering cities and seizing land, it has long exceeded the threshold of war and peace. Since we are unwilling to give up, we should fight to survive and exert our utmost in resistance. The national policy is established; only this one word remains. Steadfastly adhere to it without wavering, regardless of whether one is in or out of office.</p>
<p>As for the government authorities, based on the standpoint of national policy, they have concrete plans and carefully considered implementation to effectively mobilize and deploy resources. Let us leave that aside for now. However, there are those who, lacking modern knowledge of political and military affairs, out of a desire for complete victory, give rise to concerns. They eloquently express their views in front of their superiors, and pace anxiously in their rooms when alone in deep thought. In reality, these worries are unnecessary. But understandably, their concern for the country is genuine. I dare to speak plainly to them: when a war begins, it should aim for the most economical use of time and resources, and the least amount of losses, to strike the enemy and achieve victory. But now, as a weak nation, we do not hesitate to engage in prolonged battles, resulting in scorched earth across vast lands, brave soldiers dying in battle, the old and weak being left in ditches, and the suffering of the people. These are hardships that other warring parties try to avoid, but we willingly endure them. Given the vastness of our territory, the size of our population, the abundance of our resources, and the simplicity of our supplies, even scorched earth tactics can exhaust the enemy's large army, and prolonged resistance can deplete the enemy's resources. An exhausted army with depleted resources is incapable of fighting. This concept of ultimate victory is demonstrated by the fact that Japan, at the very beginning of its military mobilization, immediately implemented tax increases and expanded its budget, further strengthening our belief.</p>
<p>Since the national policy has been determined and repeatedly emphasized by the authorities, and the war has already begun, the people have no choice but to move forward. From today onwards, the people should patiently await battle reports. Initially, there is no need to question the gains or losses of minor skirmishes. It is essential to wait for the final victory. However, Japan, after exhausting its military aggression, is now attempting to achieve its goals through diplomatic means, as if to supplement its military strength with diplomatic maneuvers. As the aggressor, there is nothing Japan will not do. However, our iron principles are firm, and our major plans are long decided. The government colleagues have unified opinions, and the people of the entire nation are vowing to be loyal and devoted. Looking towards the soldiers suffering in Tianjin, there are no tears to express their feelings. Facing the martyred compatriots, they swallow their grief in anguish. Surely, no one would dare to violate the national policy, exceed the final limit, abandon the life-and-death moment, and willingly become a sinner for all time. At this moment of national survival, officials and colleagues are united in heart, which is truly commendable. I especially express its meaning as a guarantee for ultimate victory.</p>
<h3>Japan's Active Aggression Against China: Second Supplementary Budget</h3>
<p>Totaling 410 Million Yuan, Special Tax Bill Submitted to Parliament, Konoe Responds to Assembly Members' Questions, Maintains Non-Expansion Policy</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 1:55 PM today. Due to the urgent submission of the Special Tax Bill for the North China Incident, the atmosphere in the assembly hall suddenly became tense. After first deciding on ten agenda items, it approved eight items, including the Gold Production Bill, based on the committee chairman's report. Five proposals from assembly members were entrusted to committees. There was a recess at 2:50 PM. (4th, Domei News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The source of funds for the second expenditure on the North China Incident is to be secured through increased tax revenue and the issuance of public bonds for the North China Incident. The details are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Increase tax revenue: 66 million yen in actual revenue for the current fiscal year. ㊁ Increase tax revenue: 36 million yen receivable for the next fiscal year. ㊂ Additional issuance of 308 million yen in public bonds for the North China Incident. If combined with the 96 million yen issued in the first round, the total amount would reach 404 million yen. According to Finance Minister Kaya's explanation, the supplementary budget for the second phase of the North China Incident is 410 million yen, which can be divided into the following categories: 5 million yen under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 300 million yen for the Ministry of the Army, 100 million yen for the Ministry of the Navy, and 3.3 million yen under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance (for public bond expenses), totaling 408.3 million yen. (4th, Domei News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At 4:00 PM on the 4th, the government submitted the Special Tax Bill for the North China Incident to the House of Representatives. At the same time, it released the rationale for the bill as follows:</p>
<p>In order to raise funds to cover a portion of the expenses for the North China Incident, a special tax for the North China Incident will be established. Income tax and temporary profit tax will be increased. At the same time, a special tax will be levied on a portion of dividends and interest on public and corporate bonds, as well as on specified goods. This is the reason for submitting this bill. (4th, Domei News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The plenary session of the House of Representatives continued in the afternoon. After approving five items, including the Tax Rate Amendment Bill, the Special Tax Bill for the North China Incident was urgently submitted. After the Finance Minister's explanation, questioning began. Shinohara Rikuro of the Minsei Party first questioned the reason for limiting the implementation period of the bill to one year. Finance Minister Kaya replied:</p>
<p>This tax is a direct tax levied on those with greater taxpaying ability, and we do not want to make this tax permanent.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Sunada Shigemasa stated:</p>
<p>The situation in North China has now expanded. To resolve the situation, I wonder if the government intends to convene an extraordinary session of parliament.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Konoe replied:</p>
<p>The government is adopting a local and partial solution, and originally did not want the situation to expand. The policy has not changed to this day. If the situation actually expands, we will also adhere to the established policy. Even in extremely adverse circumstances, we still intend to adopt flexible response measures. The government will definitely do so. Whether or not to convene an extraordinary session of parliament, I am unable to explain at this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Kiyose Ichiro stated:</p>
<p>It is said that this tax increase has the meaning of a donation, but I fear that the amount is too small and it is inconvenient to demand that the national sentiment be tense, so that donations from all sectors can be rationalized. What does the authorities think?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kaya replied:</p>
<p>It is commendable that the entire nation is united in dealing with matters, but from a financial perspective, there is no need to exhaust all efforts. Mr. Kawakami Buntaro asked:</p>
<p>This tax increase is a tax on all classes and seems to avoid mass taxation. But in the event that the situation unfortunately expands, will we still adhere to this policy to the end?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kaya replied:</p>
<p>If the incident worsens, there may be a need to consider the tax issue. But in the current situation, there is still no need to exert all our efforts. Because this tax is a direct tax, it should not cause the prices of necessities to rise.</p>
<p>After Kato, Watanabe, and others had some questions and answers with the Finance Minister, the questioning ended and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. (4th, Domei News)</p>
<h3>Japan's Aggression Against China Violates International Law</h3>
<p>American Newspapers Advocate Invoking the Nine-Power Treaty, Countries Responsible for Far Eastern Peace Should Assume Joint Responsibility</p>
<p>[New York] Public opinion here on Japan's active aggression against China advocates invoking the Nine-Power Treaty. The New York Eagle published an editorial stating: Japan claims to maintain peace in Asia, but its aggression against China is still actively advancing. The Nine-Power Treaty was signed jointly by China, the United States, and Japan. Violating this treaty violates international law. Therefore, countries such as England and France have recently indicated to Japan that all countries must be jointly responsible for peace in the Far East. (4th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Denounces Japanese Military Atrocities</h3>
<p>Soviet Consulate in Tianjin Vandalized, Russia Vows Retaliation Against Japan</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the incident of Japanese anti-White Russian vandalism of the Soviet consulate in Tianjin, the News reported: "The shameless atrocities of the Japanese warlords and their White Russian pawns have made the entire Soviet people enraged. These aggressors, not satisfied with insulting the Chinese people, are now challenging all sides. The destruction of the Tianjin consulate was clearly directed by the Japanese warlords. They are using all means to provoke the Soviet Union. Their atrocities will receive an appropriate response from the Soviet Union, and their faces as troublemakers, challengers, and bandits will be branded before the entire civilized world."</p>
<p>Pravda stated: "Not satisfied with occupying Tianjin, the Japanese warlords are even intentionally clashing with French soldiers and organizing attacks on the Soviet consulate. At that time, the leading officials of the Japanese consulate shrank back like turtles, refusing to meet with the Soviet consul and attend meetings of the consular corps, openly provoking disputes on the one hand and hiding from people on the other. What is their baseness and shamelessness? The reason why the Japanese warlords dare to openly loot Chinese cities, even in concession areas, is the same reason why Japanese imperialism can freely invade the entire China: the Chinese people, although willing to resist foreign invaders, are not sufficiently organized, and the open connivance of other capitalist countries encourages Japan to recklessly slaughter as if they are bandits." The newspaper concluded: "The Japanese warlords and their White Russian bandits have repeatedly provoked on the Soviet border in the past, but they have also received merciless responses. They have realized that the Soviet territory is inviolable, and now they are using despicable means to vent their anger on the Soviet building within the land they have forcibly occupied. But this kind of vicious provocation will not only fail, but will eventually encounter an appropriate retaliation." (3rd, TASS)</p>
<h3>Suma Visits American Authorities to Exchange Information on the Far East</h3>
<p>[Washington] Suma, the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States and the former Consul-General in Nanjing, exchanged information with the Department of State today regarding the situation in the Far East. Afterwards, Suma told a reporter from the Associated Press that the incident of the Soviet consulate in Tianjin being looted was also mentioned, but Japan believes that this is a dispute between Russian factions. Although the plan for American expatriates in Shandong to concentrate in safe locations was discussed, it was merely an exchange of information, as this matter is purely related to the American government. Suma also said that he had notified the Department of State of the news of Chinese troops moving north, but details could not be published. (3rd, National News)</p>
<h3>Germany Reaffirms Neutral Stance on China-Japan Dispute</h3>
<p>[London] Local authorities have already denied reports that British Foreign Secretary Eden has asked Germany to mediate the China-Japan conflict. It is said that it is unknown whether the British Foreign Secretary harbors such intentions, and it is pointed out that such efforts can only be considered after both parties involved in the Far East dispute have clearly expressed their hope for mediation. (3rd, Haitong News)</p>
<p>[Berlin] A report by the Soviet official news agency claimed that England had asked Germany and Italy to mediate the Far East dispute, which has caused surprise, because Germany and Italy "benefit from the escalation of the international situation," and Germany is an ally of Japan. They also participated in inciting the recent conflict in Heilongjiang. Local authorities pointed out that this report clearly intends to provoke disputes and intensify the current tense situation. Germany is not an "ally" of Japan and has only signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. In view of this malicious report, the Anti-Comintern Pact is indeed necessary. Germany is completely neutral on the Far East dispute, maintains friendly relations with both sides, and does not want to assist Japan. Regarding the Heilongjiang conflict, Germany has no interests in that area and has no reason to participate in inciting it. Germany hopes to take steps to eliminate this report that causes disputes. (4th, Haitong News)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Reveals Pro-Japanese Bias</h3>
<p>[Rome] The chief editor of the Italian News published an editorial today, stating that the Far East incident will not turn into an international dispute at present. It goes without saying that the League of Nations is powerless. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States maintain normal friendly relations with both Nanjing and Tokyo. At the same time, they clearly stated that they will not directly or indirectly interfere in this matter, given Foreign Minister Hirota's declaration that he firmly rejects any mediation. Therefore, the Far East dispute will be purely a China-Japan affair, but it will have an impact on the position and policies of all countries. (3rd, Haitong News)</p>

<h3>Japan Charters British Ships to Transport Steel</h3>
<p>[London] The temporary demand from Japan for chartering British ships is currently a characteristic of the shipping market. According to The Times, Japan chartered two British ships yesterday for Far East trade for a period of six months, with charter rates of ten shillings and sixpence and eleven shillings respectively. This demand from Japan has not yet ended, and charter rates for merchant ships may continue to rise in the face of needs from all quarters. Japan is demolishing old ships, so it currently needs to charter ships to make up for the shortage. In addition, Japan is transporting large quantities of steel from Europe and India, and the import of scrap steel from the United States to Japan has also increased recently. The Times stated that if Japan is at war in China, it will inevitably use a large portion of its merchant ships in the Far East. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Lingering Aftermath of the Typhoon in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Wind Blows Towards Anhui Province; Ships Dare Not Venture Out to Sea; Shanties Collapse and Electric Wires Kill</p>
<p>After making landfall in Hangzhou Bay, the typhoon from the Pacific Ocean directly struck Shanghai on the night before last. Due to its fierce winds, the damage it caused was significant everywhere. Although it has now largely moved out of the Shanghai area, passing through the Tai Lake basin and entering the interior, the tail end of the storm continues to lash the city. Bamboo fences, wooden barriers, and other less sturdy structures have been blown down. Scattered debris litters the streets, and the storefronts and residences on both sides have been greatly transformed. Because the tail of the storm has not yet passed, the damage in various places remains substantial. A description of yesterday's situation follows:</p>
<p>The Wind Travels Northwest</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, according to the report from the Great Observatory, the typhoon's force remained extremely strong, with a speed of sixty nautical miles per hour, heading north-northwest. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it was located at longitude 119 degrees and latitude 32 degrees, approximately in the southern Jian Lake area on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui. By the 2:00 PM report, the typhoon had passed Zhenjiang and swept over the capital at 3:50 PM, reaching 22 degrees north latitude and 118 degrees east longitude. The wind direction had also shifted to due north, seeming to threaten the Bengbu area, which would greatly affect inland crops. It was also learned that Shandong and the Yellow Sea area were experiencing strong northeasterly winds due to the typhoon's northward trend. The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River were hit by gale-force winds and rain, while the lower reaches had overcast skies and strong southeasterly winds. The Jianghai Customs signal station had removed one of the two warning globes yesterday morning, indicating that the wind force was beyond 100 nautical miles and not as turbulent as the previous day's roaring and howling, although the flow was still continuous, it was gradually becoming milder.</p>
<p>Shipping Disrupted</p>
<p>The typhoon struck Shanghai for over a day and night, disrupting maritime traffic. After forty hours, some shipping resumed yesterday afternoon, but some had not yet recovered. Among the Chinese and foreign vessels leaving port in the morning were the Nippon Yusen's Ryuta Maru, Da Lai's Jackson, and Great Britain's Ka什伊顯. An hour later, Jiang Shun, Shun Tian, Bei Fang, Guang Dong, Hai Yuan, Tai Shun, Zhou Shan, Da Xing, Xin Ming, and others, totaling eighteen ships, successively departed. Each ship went to the Wusongkou to assess the winds and waves before deciding whether to proceed. City ferries, small steamers, civilian boats, sampans, and barges within the Huangpu River all stopped running and sought shelter in small harbors, gradually resuming operation only after 10:00 AM yesterday. A few small steamers were seen operating on the river surface. Due to the typhoon, the wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River were unable to load and unload cargo, causing work to stop for forty hours as well, gradually resuming loading and unloading around noon yesterday. By the afternoon, small sampans still dared not venture out in the wind and waves. The Ningbo-Shanghai route ships Xin Jiang Tian and Ning Yu were sheltering in Zhenhai, while the Xin Ning Shao and Xin Bei Jing, which were in Shanghai, suspended their voyages. Yesterday afternoon, the Ning Shao's Xin Ning Shao and the Wenzhou-Taizhou route's Zhou Shan and Da Xing ships, seeing that the wind had left Shanghai, normally set sail and left port. However, upon reaching Wusong, they deemed the sea conditions too dangerous and dared not venture out to sea, so they returned to Shanghai to wait for the next sailing. It was heard that the Ningbo's Ning Xing and Xin Jiang Tian had already left Ningbo. The Shi He ship of the Gong Ji trading firm of this port unloaded its cargo at Twelve Forts and sailed back to Shanghai. While sailing on the Fushan estuary sea, they encountered the typhoon. To avoid danger, the ship quickly dropped anchor, but the wind force was too great, and the large iron anchor chain broke, causing the anchor to sink to the bottom of the sea. Fearing an accident, the ship steered towards the shore and avoided one, but the hull was slightly grounded, fortunately they escaped danger immediately. The ship sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, informing that they were returning to Shanghai. As for whether other ships had accidents, the companies had not received reports yesterday.</p>
<p>Lights Out</p>
<p>When the typhoon struck Shanghai at midnight the day before, the wind force was extreme, so it was very strong when it struck Shanghai. As the wind howled, buildings rattled, and citizens were awakened from their sleep. The streetlights and some residential lights in the areas of Shanghai's Min Guo Road, Zhong Hua Road, Xieqiao, and Gaochang Temple went out for two hours because the main lines were affected by the wind. The telephone lines in the Wusong, Jiangwan, and Longhua areas were cut because of their proximity to the coast. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau dispatched workers to repair them immediately, and they were completely restored by last night.</p>
<p>Special Zone Number Two Streets</p>
<p>In Shanghai's Second Special Zone, i.e., the French Concession's Huangpu Bund, Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Avenue Joffre, and other roads, the larger trees on both sides of the roads were blown down, and the smaller ones were uprooted and toppled. Also, lower-lying roads and streets, such as the Caishi Street area from the east end of Zhengjia Muqiao Street to the Dongxi Zilaihuo Street, and routes like Rue Massenet, Rue Saussure, Route Mercier, etc., were knee-deep in water due to the overflowing of Jiangshui and underground sewers. The worst was the French Municipal Council's two sides of Avenue Joffre opposite Shangxian Fang. In other areas of the concession, shop signs and laundry racks on the balconies were blown down in several places, fortunately, no one was injured. As for the fallen trees, the Municipal Council hired workers yesterday morning to replant them or clear them away.</p>
<p>Many Collapsed Houses</p>
<p>The situation of house collapses in Zhabei has been briefly noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that behind the billboard next to the standard clock at the northern end of the Xin Zha Bridge also collapsed a kitchen room and a section of high wall along the road. Also, at No. 19 and 20 of Dexing Li across from the Xinmin Road Xin Zha Police Station, two empty buildings collapsed, fortunately, no one was injured. In addition, almost all awnings were destroyed, resulting in considerable losses. The awning of the Shanghai-Taicang Automobile Company's car factory at the intersection of Hutai Road was also blown down by the strong wind and fell on the electric pole at the entrance. Yesterday, the awning was removed and the electric pole was repaired. In addition, eight or nine out of ten of the thatched sheds in various places, such as Tanziwan, Dayang Bridge, Pingjiang Bridge, Pushan Road, Zhonghua Xin Road, Gonghe Xin Road, Liuying Road, etc., were damaged. Yesterday afternoon, it was seen that the poor people in those places were repairing them. At the same time, in Zhabei, due to the high tide of the Wusong River (commonly known as Suzhou River), low-lying areas, such as the Pendang Lane Nunnery to the Old Rubbish Bridge section, the Xin Rubbish Bridge to Wuzhen Road Bridge section, and the Xin Zha Bridge west to the Sampan Factory section, had river water rising onto the land in the lowest places. The worst was the east end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge, in front of the Bank of Communications warehouse. Due to the siltation of the sewers, the accumulated water had not drained away until around 3:00 PM yesterday. The wind blew into waves, and employees entering and leaving the warehouse had to cross the water on long planks. A dozen naughty children were playing happily in the water.</p>
<p>Electric Wire Kills</p>
<p>On the Pudong Tangqiao Pudong Avenue side, many electric poles were broken by the strong typhoon the day before. Some electric wires fell to the ground, and some were hanging. Unfortunately, a man, about thirty years old, wearing a Xiangyun yarn short shirt and black Indian silk pants, passed by. Because the hanging electric wire blocked the road, he reached out to push it away. Unexpectedly, the current shocked his hand, as if it were glued on. At the same time, a gust of wind wrapped two electric wires around his body, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. Afterwards, someone notified the electric company to come to the scene and cut the electric wires, but there was no way to revive the dead. Upon inspection, the word "王" (Wang) was tattooed on the dead man's right arm, and the letter "S" was tattooed on the tiger's mouth of his right thumb. Yesterday, the local headman reported to the local court for verification. ㊁ At the Lai Yi ferry Beihuo Tang Road, the chimney of the tiger stove opened by the local Xí Guānróng fell down and hit Xi's head, fortunately, the injury was light and he is expected to be safe. ㊂ Twenty to thirty thatched sheds were blown down in the area of Eighteen Rooms and the Blue Chimney Wharf. The Jiangbei poor people had nowhere to live and were exposed to the wind and rain, in a very pitiful situation. ㊃ Hundreds of trees planted on both sides of Pudong Avenue were blown down, causing regret among passersby. ㊄ At 9:00 AM, the Yizhong Tobacco Factory in Lujiazui temporarily stopped work due to wind and rain, causing a false alarm among the workers. ㊅ Generally, male and female workers working in various tobacco and cotton factories in Yangshupu had no boats to cross the river and return home in the evening after going to the factories in the morning. ㊅ Countless fences were blown down everywhere. Calculated by the length of connections, there were at least a thousand zhang. ㊇ Pudong and Puxi's mail was suspended for a day due to the interruption of traffic on the Huangpu River, and postal service only resumed yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Telephone Restored</p>
<p>Many poles and trees were broken in the area outside the Wusong district, and the electric wires were in a mess. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Wusong long-distance telephone was interrupted. Although the town could still make calls, there was a lot of noise. Fallen electric wires were everywhere. The Wusong Water and Electricity Plant office, in order to avoid danger, stopped the current yesterday and immediately sent workers to sort things out. It will take about two or three days to restore the original condition.</p>
<p>Thatched Sheds Blown Down</p>
<p>More than thirty thatched sheds on Shanghai's No. 4 Zhongshan Road were blown down by the wind. Also, more than one hundred thatched sheds were blown down at the bottom of Jiesifei Road and north of the Dihang. Around Bailinan Road's Zhoujiaqiao, over forty thatched sheds were also blown down. The residents there are all coolies, and for a time they had nowhere to stay. Amidst the wind and rain, they all cried and walked everywhere to find shelter, in a very miserable situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe May Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency says that Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru has been kept in Dalian for a long time by the Japanese garrison in North China. Now, after repeated instructions from the Japanese Foreign Ministry to return south, according to Japanese sources in Shanghai, Kawagoe flew to Dalian the day before yesterday and yesterday noon, accompanied by Chinese Counselor Shimizu and Secretary Hoshida, boarded the Dalian Steamship Company's Qingdao Maru. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon without stopping in Qingdao. However, if the ship is affected by the typhoon, it will be delayed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ping Delayed 20 Hours</h3>
<p>Add Passenger Cars to the Beijing-Shanghai Line to Facilitate Travel and Avoid Crowding</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ping train that departed from Jinan the day before yesterday was delayed by more than twenty hours due to the very crowded passengers and delays at various stations along the way. It is estimated that it will arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 AM this morning. The Shanghai-Ping train that departed from Shanghai to Jinan at 12:00 AM last night (i.e., 0:00 AM this morning) had to wait for the train cars to arrive, so it was also delayed accordingly. The extent of the delay of the train that left Jinan yesterday is not yet known. In order to regulate the travel on this section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, two extra passenger trains were opened at 12:00 AM last night from Beijing and Shanghai stations to replace the regular trains. In addition, in recent days, the number of middle and lower-class passengers traveling to the interior has been very crowded. The railway specially added a third and fourth-class passenger train at 9:00 PM last night to facilitate travel.</p>

<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Zheng Hongnian and Wu Jingxiong took the night train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Rescue Team Departs Today</h3>
<p>Catholic Church and Charity to Organize Relief</p>
<p>The rescue team organized by the General Association of the Red Cross Society of China has decided that two major groups will be undertaken by the National Shanghai Medical College and the National Tongji University. They are scheduled to go to a certain place today to implement their work. In addition, in order to centralize the city's medicines to meet the urgent needs of the rescue team and wounded soldiers' hospitals, the association specially convened representatives of the pharmaceutical industry yesterday, designated goods, and purchased medicines worth hundreds of thousands of yuan at a fixed price to avoid shortages. Currently, there are 300,000 refugees in Tianjin, suffering from hunger and homelessness. The Red Cross Society and various charitable organizations are discussing relief methods. The General Association of the Red Cross Society will first undertake 10,000 yuan, and various groups will separately identify and raise 50,000 yuan, and then send representatives to Tianjin to join hands with the charity groups in Hubei, in addition to providing emergency relief, and set up shelters.</p>
<p>Lu Renhong, President of the Chinese Catholic National Association, in view of the outbreak of war in North China, has joined forces with the Shanghai Federation of Charity Organizations and the Chinese Red Cross Society to organize shelters, and has obtained the consent of a major hospital and a certain university in the French Concession to be used as future shelters and sanatoriums, and plans to organize a rescue team to send to the front line to work. However, there is a lack of first aid surgical instruments and medicines, etc. They are currently raising funds to purchase them. Patriotic people from all walks of life who are willing to donate can send them directly to the association.</p>
<h3>Xiao Zhenying Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Former Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying went abroad to Europe this spring for investigation. After learning of the outbreak of the North China Incident and the full-scale war, he stopped his overseas investigation and rushed back to the country by plane from the United States. According to a Shenzhou News Agency reporter's investigation yesterday, Xiao's Pan American Airlines plane arrived in Hong Kong from Manila yesterday, and a telegram was sent to relatives and friends in Shanghai yesterday. After arriving in Hong Kong, Xiao was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane today. Because CNAC's Shanghai-bound plane was blocked by the typhoon yesterday and did not fly south, there will be no plane north today, and he may change to coming to Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Mayor Yu's Swearing-In Ceremony Scheduled</h3>
<p>Mayor Yu of this city, after receiving the clear order from the Central Government to remove him, should first inspect the industry on July 17, and separately report the letters and announcements to let everyone know.

<p>Following the arrival of Yan Xishan, Yu Hanmou, and He Jian in Beijing, Bai Chongxi also boarded a special plane sent by the Central Government yesterday and entered Beijing from Guangxi. The movements of these important border officials are sufficient to dispel the doubts and anxieties of the people and completely eliminate the atmosphere of gloom in North China. The Central Government's decisive measures to deal with the current serious national difficulties can be inferred from this. Recently, according to a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency, Zou Lu, a member of the Central Committee who stayed in Guangdong Province, is scheduled to take the Japanese Empress ship from Hong Kong on the 6th to come north. Xiao Focheng, a party-state elder who is convalescing in Thailand, also intends to return home in the near future, despite his illness, to prepare to overcome national difficulties with comrades in the Central Committee.

The Japanese nationals in Yichang, Shashi, and other places in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have now completely withdrawn, so there are no Japanese nationals in that area. Only a few have not withdrawn in Hankou, Wuhu, Anqing, and other places, but they are all preparing to leave and can come to Shanghai and return to Japan in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Manzanar Maru Fully Loaded with North China Refugees Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the North China Incident, foreigners and Chinese people from Tianjin, Dagu, Yantai, Qingdao, and other places in North China flocked south to take refuge. Since the Shanghai-Ping train could not directly reach Tianjin, refugees from the Pingjin area mostly changed to taking ships south by sea. It is learned that the Manzanar Maru, a ship of the Netherlands East Indies Line, which set sail from Dagu Tianjin amidst the fierce fighting in Tianjin, carrying a large number of Chinese and foreign people fleeing south from Shanxi and North China, will arrive in Shanghai this morning. According to reports, the ship was originally scheduled to enter port yesterday, but was changed to today due to the typhoon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Monks Begin Training Today</h3>
<p>Huang Hanzhi and Others Also Organize Rescue Teams</p>
<p>As the Sino-Japanese war becomes increasingly urgent, support associations and shelters have been organized everywhere. Buddhist celebrities in this city, Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, and others, have also been preparing for rescue work, and have drawn monks from the four major righteous forests in this port, Fuzang Temple, Qingliang Temple, Jade Buddha Temple, and Haichao Temple, for training. In addition, the Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations has established a rescue team in preparation for rescuing refugees in the war zone, and has entrusted the Chinese Buddhist Association to select physically strong monks to participate in training. The first batch of one hundred has been selected and will begin training at the orphanage today, teaching them various necessary first aid knowledge. The training period is set for ten to fifteen days. After the first batch expires, the second phase of training will be held.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Asks the Municipal Council to Pay Attention to Japanese Disturbing Public Order</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Council, saying: Dear Sirs, with reference to the letter from the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association stating that it has recently received reports that the Japanese have been organizing special agent teams in the concession to disturb public order since the outbreak of the war in North China, it is hereby stated that this matter concerns the public order of the concession, and it is hereby requested that your council immediately file a protest with the Municipal Council to maintain public order, etc., to the association. It is hereby stated that the Japanese soldiers have been violating police authority and threatening public order in the area for more than a day, and have recently taken off their masks and revealed their barbaric nature, hostile to world civilization, hostile to world progress, and hostile to world peace. The facts are clear, and public opinion has condemned them. Peace has decided to fight them. Even the Chinese and foreign newspapers in this port, especially the British and American newspapers, have criticized them with all their might! It is clear that democratic governance is striving for light. In accordance with the preceding letter, we hope that this report is based on facts that do not yet exist, but your bureau is responsible for the public order within the area and has an unshirkable responsibility, so as to ensure that these rumors do not exist. It is hereby requested that you investigate, exercise serious vigilance, and maintain the area's security.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Forbids Japanese Police Officers from Leaving the Concession</h3>
<p>Foreign Police Officers Are Also Subject to Restrictions; The Intention Is to Ensure Security Within the Concession</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily News says that the Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday prohibiting Japanese and foreign police officers from leaving the concession to avoid various disputes. According to Uehara, the Japanese Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, the following statement was issued: It is true that the Municipal Council has issued a strong directive prohibiting Japanese and foreign police officers from leaving the concession. However, this policy is not entirely negative. Since the North China Incident, the Municipal Council has been working hard to ensure the security of the concession, preparing for any eventuality, so it has ordered all police officers not to take leave and to stand by, so that they can be summoned in an emergency. If police officers have private affairs, they should also avoid going to the Nanshi, Zhabei, and other areas outside the concession, but this directive has no other meaning, but is to ensure the security of the concession.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Actively Prepare to Advance National Salvation Work</h3>
<p>Recently, the atmosphere of nationwide resistance has been strong, and the whole country, from top to bottom, is in high spirits. Various sectors in this city are actively advancing work during this extraordinary period. Based on the information obtained, the details are recorded as follows:</p>

Yesterday, the association received a large batch of silverware from Ms. Liang Yiqing, wife of Chen Beilan, the former general manager of the Hong Kong Zizhi Daily, including nineteen silver tripods and other items, of great value.

All our citizens should do their best to contribute their wealth and exert their strength to overcome national difficulties. Only in this way can the nation be saved. Rear support work must be actively carried out, so that the soldiers on the front line have no worries. Considering that the people of the country have always paid little attention to scrap copper and iron, the enemy takes the opportunity to buy it to meet the needs of wartime. If prevention is not taken urgently, the damage in the future will be unimaginable. Our school, in view of this, has initiated a collection of a thousand catties of scrap copper and iron from all students and their relatives, and specially sent it to your association to be transferred to the government. This move can not only prevent traitors from buying scrap copper and iron and reselling them to support the enemy, but also increase the raw materials for manufacturing military supplies in our country. We respectfully ask your association to strongly advocate and petition the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to hold a student iron donation movement, so that hundreds of thousands of catties of scarce steel and iron in this city can be collected easily. This matter concerns national salvation, and we hope you will consider it with gratitude.</p>
<p>Shipping Merchants Strictly Prevent Renting Vessels to Support the Enemy</p>
<p>According to insiders in the shipping industry, there are quite a few national vessels rented to Japanese merchants. However, it is understandable that the ships could not be taken back due to prior contracts. At this critical time of resistance against the enemy, there are actually treacherous merchants who only care about profit and still want to rent out ships to support the enemy, which is simply insane. It is also said that the relevant authorities are closely investigating and trying to ban this.</p>

<h3>Nouveau Riche Unjustly Abandon Adopted Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>Yao Lindi Sues to Maintain Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Lu Atao Demands Reimbursement of Training Expenses</p>
<p>Lu Juxing Salted Goods Store at No. 196 Xizhen Town, Yangjing, Pudong, is opened by Lu Atao. His son, Lu Liugen, is 18 years old. Since childhood, Yao Lindi (17 years old) was raised as his daughter-in-law. Now, because Lu Liugen does not want to marry this woman, Yao Lindi is anxious and retains lawyer Xu Xingdi to sue the local court requesting enforcement of the marriage contract, and attacking her father-in-law for being greedy and abandoning the poor. The lawsuit states: In 1926,</p>
<p>She Has Been a Child Bride, Working Diligently Day and Night, Fulfilling Her Duties as a Daughter-in-Law. However, Lu Atao's Business Has Been Flourishing Recently, and His Family Has Gradually Become Wealthy. He Has Actually Become a Nouveau Riche and Unjustly, Arrogantly, and Rudely Abruptly Expelled Her Last Winter. Although the Original Matchmaker Has Repeatedly Sent Her to Lu's House, She Has Been Rejected. She Grew Up in the Fields, and Has Always Been Focused on Honesty and Etiquette. According to Custom, Divorce Is Considered a Shameful Thing. Now That She Has Been</p>
<p>Unjustly Divorced by Lu, She Feels Deeply Ashamed and Heartbroken. She Has Been in Lu's Family for More Than Ten Years. She Has Never Made Mistakes or Disobeyed Her Parents-in-Law. Since Being Divorced, Distant and Close Relatives Have Been Suspicious, Causing Much Gossip and Scandal. Moreover, She Is a Child Bride, Which Is Fundamentally Different from an Ordinary Marriage. Therefore, She Requests That the Marriage Contract Be Valid, and</p>
<p>Compensate for Losses of One Thousand Yuan, Etc. Yesterday, Judge Wang Run Held a Hearing. The Defendant Retained Lawyer Pan Zhensheng to Act as His Agent, Saying That Lu Liugen Does Not Want His Fiancee, Which Has Nothing to Do with His Father. According to Law, He Cannot Be Forced, and He Not Only Does Not Wish to Compensate for Losses, But the Plaintiff Came as a Child, and Was Raised and Taught by Lu Atao, and Several Hundred Yuan Was Spent</p>
<p>To Cultivate Her Education. Therefore, the Plaintiff Should Be Ordered to Return Lu Atao's Food and Tuition Fees for Eleven Years, Etc. The Court Discussion Was Adjourned for Further Hearing.</p>
<h3>Yu Shunxing Leather Trunk Store: Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Dispute</h3>
<p>Daughter-in-Law Claims Trunk as Her Own, Mother-in-Law Sues for Severance of Relationship</p>
<p>Yu Shunxing Leather Trunk Store, located on Jixiang Street in the French Concession, was opened by people from Beicai. When the old owner was alive, it had many branches and dominated the Shanghai leather trunk industry. The old owner passed away ten years ago, and his sons also managed to revive the business for a time. However, recently, it is not as prosperous as before. The old store on Jixiang Street is currently managed by the old owner's second wife, Yu Cai, who employs Jiang Afu as the manager. Yu Cai only has daughters, namely Cai Yu, Chen Yu, and Lu Yu. On the male side, the first wife bore Yu Jinliang, who also runs a leather trunk business under a different banner. Additionally, there is</p>
<p>an adopted son named Yu Shangzhi, who opened Yu Yuansheng Leather Trunk Store at 52 Huayi Street in the South City. Yu Shangzhi passed away on May 10th of this year, leaving behind his widowed wife, Yu Tang, and several orphans, in dire straits. All that remained were about five hundred leather trunks in the store, valued at over a thousand yuan, which was insufficient for funeral expenses and to provide a livelihood for the widow and orphans. Therefore, the body was displayed for two or three days. Finally, a mediator was invited to the scene, and Yu Cai, the aunt, promised to allocate two tile-roofed houses and ten mu of land in Wafang, Beicai Town, Pudong, and provide monthly expenses. In return, Yu Cai would handle the Yu Yuansheng Leather Trunk Store on Huayi Street. However, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were not on good terms, and problems arose regarding the monthly living expenses. Recently, when customers came to Jixiang Street to purchase,</p>
<p>Yu Cai instructed Jiang Afu and her daughters Cai Yu and Chen Yu to go to Yu Yuansheng on Huayi Street to take away the leather trunks. Yu Tang refused, resulting in a conflict. As a result, Yu Tang and Cai Yu were both taken to the police station. However, as it was a family dispute, they were both ordered to return home. However, Yu Tang and Yu Cai were unwilling to give in, and their relationship had completely broken down. Yu Tang then sued her aunt, as well as her husband's sisters and Jiang Afu, in the local court for robbery and assault. Yu Cai also recounted her daughter-in-law's shortcomings and requested the court to sever the relationship. Summons were issued on the past two days, and the matter is awaiting investigation.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Falls into a Brothel, Cries for Help from Window and is Rescued</h3>
<p>Enduring Four Customers in One Night, Unable to Bear the Suffering, Brothel Owner Arrested and Prosecuted by the Police</p>
<p>Zhang Wang, a young woman from Huzhou, aged twenty-three, was lured to Shanghai by Chen Zhu, a woman from the same hometown, ten days ago. She was lodged at 54 Chuanji Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. The day before yesterday, on the pretext of recommending her to work in a factory, Chen Zhu sold Zhang Wang to Zhao Xiao, a Yangzhou woman who ran a brothel at 41 Longmen Road, forcing her into prostitution. In one night, Zhang Wang had to serve four customers. Zhang Wang found this kind of inhumane life no different</p>
<p>from a living hell and could not bear it. Yesterday morning, she took the opportunity to open the window and loudly cried for help. Nearby Chinese constables heard the alarm and reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Xichang. Wang rescued Zhang Wang from the brothel and arrested the brothel owner, Zhao Xiao, along with prostitutes Wang Zhao Di and Wang Xiao Ru Yi Zi. Zhao Xiao was detained, and the others were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for shelter. The police also worked with detectives from the Zhabei Police Bureau to locate related persons Chen Zhu, Qian Gong, and Zhao Lu at 54 Chuanji Lane, Xinjiang Road.</p>
<p>All three were detained at the police station to await documentation and transfer. Yesterday morning, Zhao Xiao was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Luotang stated the above situation and prosecuted Zhao Xiao for violating Article 300, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, for restricting freedom. According to Zhang Wang's statement, she was from Huzhou, aged twenty-three, and had been living in her hometown with her husband, Zhang Bingmu. Ten days ago, a woman named Ye A'san (i.e., Chen Zhu) came to my house, saying she had something important and asked me to go with her. I went with her, but that night I was</p>
<p>taken to Shanghai and first lodged in Zhabei. Until the day before yesterday, Ye A'san said that she had recommended me to a factory and urged me to go to work quickly. I was then taken to the defendant's place and locked in a room. I still didn't know I had fallen into a brothel. Until the evening, the defendant and a maid forced me to put on makeup and stand on the street to solicit customers. Then I realized I was trapped, but under their lewd power, I had no room to resist and could only let them do what they wanted. Later, I received a man in a suit who said he would pay two yuan and forty cents for the night. When we entered the room, I refused to comply, and the man also</p>
<p>expressed sympathy and left, promising to help me. Unexpectedly, the defendants still forced me to receive customers. I then received a man in short clothes who paid two yuan and was raped once. However, the defendant still refused to give up and continued to force me to solicit customers. Afterwards, I received two more customers, but they both sat briefly, paid, and left. The money was all taken by the defendant. It wasn't until after three o'clock in the morning that I was able to rest, but the door was locked. When it was about to dawn, I managed to open the window and cry for help, and the police came to rescue me, she stated. The defendant, Zhao Xiao, gave evasive statements, denying that she ran a brothel and forced prostitution. Judge Huang discussed the matter and ordered her to be detained for further questioning on August 10. Zhang Wang was temporarily detained at the Jiliang Institute to await notification of her husband to come to the court for verification.</p>
<h3>Female Criminal Enters Jail with Tears in Her Eyes</h3>
<p>Habitual Offender Relapses Soon After Release; Though Expressing Repentance, the Law Offers No Leniency</p>
<p>Lu Xiulin, a woman from Pudong, thirty years old this year, though past her prime, is fashionably dressed. She had been imprisoned several times before for committing theft. Not long after her latest release, she relapsed. On the afternoon of the 17th of last month, at around 4 p.m., she entered the third-floor pavilion room at 74 Remi Road in the French Concession and stole thirty-two yuan in cash and several pieces of clothing. As she was about to leave, she was discovered and stopped by Dai Shan, the landlady. Dai had someone go outside to call the police, who arrested Lu and sent her to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Criminal Division Chief Jian Ning presided over the first criminal court to question her. The Police Department prosecuted her for habitual theft. Subsequently, the victim and witnesses testified about the theft and how it was discovered. Lu Xiulin's testimony was cunning and evasive, and she repeatedly expressed remorse. After reviewing the evidence, the court sentenced Lu Xiulin to four months of imprisonment for habitual theft. Pending the appeal period, she was transferred to the detention center. Lu Xiulin entered the jail with tears in her eyes upon hearing the sentence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Employee of Gonda Textile Mill Commits Suicide Grieving Over Warmongering of Japanese Military</h3>
<p>Makino Ichiro Grieves Over Son's Death in Battle; Swallows Smoke (Opium?) After Conscription Notice, But is Rescued</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, a Japanese employee of the Gonda Textile Mill revealed that Makino Ichiro, an employee of the factory's engineering section, has been working at the factory for over ten years. He usually works diligently and lives in the factory without his family. Last year, his two sons in Japan were conscripted into military service. After the outbreak of the North China Incident, the two sons happened to be serving in North China. In the battle of Tianjin and Beijing, both sons died simultaneously. Upon hearing the bad news, he was filled with grief and angrily cursed the domestic military cliques for their warmongering, which caused the people to suffer endless pain. Recently, he received a notice of conscription from his home country, causing him to be deeply stimulated. He expressed that rather than dying unconsciously on the battlefield, he would rather commit suicide. Therefore, he swallowed opium to commit suicide. However, his colleagues in the factory discovered it and rushed him to Fumin Hospital for treatment, and he was saved. He is now being monitored by his companions to prevent him from committing suicide again.</p>
<h3>Iron Explosion at Hongxiang Iron Factory Kills Worker</h3>

<p>Hu A'er, a 32-year-old worker from Wuxi at the Hongxiang Iron Factory at Chunjiang Pier, Pudong, was forging an axle tube for the rudder of a ship in the furnace at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, after the forging was red-hot, it suddenly exploded, and the red debris scattered all over his body, killing him instantly. The incident was reported to the police station, but due to the typhoon and suspension of ferries, the local bailiff, Lu Shunlong, did not report to the local court for an autopsy until yesterday. However, the deceased's brother, Hu Donglin, petitioned the court for an exemption from the autopsy. The petition was approved by Prosecutor Chen, and he signed a bond in court and was allowed to arrange for the burial himself.</p>

<h3>Extortion Through Letters Accompanied by Threats with Hand Grenade</h3>
<p>Cigarette Store Owner Reports to Police in Fear; Extortionist Apprehended in Another Case and Brought for Interrogation</p>
<p>Wu Genjin, a 51-year-old local, the owner of Shunxing Cigarette Store located at 159 Jianweilu Road outside the West Gate of the French Concession, had saved up some money through thrift and hard work. This attracted the attention of criminals. On the afternoon of the 15th of last month, at around 4 p.m., a criminal threw a letter into the store. Wu picked it up, opened it, and read it. It was an extortion letter demanding 10,000 yuan, along with two handgun bullets. The letter arranged to</p>
<p>negotiate payment on the Old Garbage Bridge on the 22nd and 23rd of the same month. Wu ignored it. On the 24th, Wu received another letter stating that if he continued to ignore them, they would resort to using hand grenades, and they arranged to meet on the 24th and 25th to negotiate. The letter also said, "You have two sons, one grenade for each of them. You have money, but who will you rely on later," and so on. After receiving the second letter, Wu became anxious and reported the letter and the evidence to the French police, requesting an investigation. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>the criminals in this case were arrested by the Public Concession Police Bureau in another case. Three suspects were apprehended and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. After investigation, the French Police Bureau requested the First Special Court to issue a document to send detectives to the First Special Court to transfer the three suspects into French Custody. Yesterday they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where they were interrogated by Liao Ning, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court. One of them, Chen Deqing (40 years old, from Funing, residing at 11 Xujiawu, Xujiajiu Road), another Zheng Mingde (also known as Lao Wu, 48 years old, from Yancheng,</p>
<p>residing in a shanty on Shanzhong Road), and the third Chen Deyu (40 years old, Chen Deqing's younger brother), gave evasive statements and also stated that the extortion letters were instructed by Feng Da, who is still at large. Subsequently, the Police Department's lawyer requested a postponement of the investigation to gather more information and arrest the remaining accomplices who are at large, and request the court to hear the case. After reviewing the evidence, the court ruled to reschedule the hearing for 9 a.m. on the 10th of the month. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Urban Air Defense Preparedness Under Attacks by Bombers and Incendiary Bombs</h3>
<p>— Alarming</p>
<p>The decline of international morality and the use of cruel weapons such as bombers and incendiary bombs by irrational countries have become commonplace! In the event of an air raid, a region's cultural institutions, administrative centers, magnificent buildings, and lives and property are all subjected to the enemy's unbridled devastation! In addition to our heartache, we must rise up to seek ways to prevent it.</p>
<p>Countries with complete air defense equipment can make any enemy bomber lose its bombing effectiveness. This point is still difficult to achieve in China today!</p>
<p>Before the European War, London had no so-called air defense facilities, and it was at a loss when enemy planes attacked. After the outbreak of the war, people gradually began to pay attention. After a considerable period of time, air defense facilities gradually became more comprehensive. In recent years, enemy planes have been unable to fulfill their bombing ambitions!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the European War, when bombers were first discovered attacking London, the citizens were panicked and at a loss, running around chaotically, resulting in a terrible situation. Countless lives and properties were sacrificed under the German planes! Until the end of the war, when citizens saw enemy planes attacking, they were able to calmly respond, taking predetermined steps. When the alarm sounded, the city was empty, and there were preparations for evacuation everywhere, and the air defense facilities were meticulous.</p>
<p>The purpose of the enemy's inhumane bombing is actually to disrupt the public's morale, create their fear of war, and cultivate their cowardice. Under these circumstances, the citizens must have at least a minimum knowledge of air defense. Merely being terrified is detrimental and useless! The government should also pay attention to air defense facilities and promote them in conjunction with each other, so that they can be effective. It is regrettable that countries that love peace often do not pay attention to this during peacetime! They should know that military preparedness is the backing of peace. Without it, we will be fish on the chopping board, only to be slaughtered!</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, some enlightened people paid attention to the importance of air defense facilities. This Lugouqiao Incident and the enemy's occupation of Tianjin and Beijing, gave us even more profound lessons! There is no shortage of specialists in the country, and they should rise up to organize air defense research institutions, make contributions to the government, and train citizens. The authorities should also pay full attention to this, and the task is so urgent that no delay is allowed!</p>
<h3>Retreat and Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Tang Ming</p>
<p>I have always paid close attention to Chairman Wang's speeches. Moreover, I have also had the honor of hearing him give impassioned and inciting speeches directly on several occasions.</p>
<p>This time, Chairman Wang returned to Nanjing from Lushan and delivered an extremely important speech. He gave a very concise explanation of the six years of forbearance, as follows: "We know that Japan is constantly invading China. Since the September 18th Incident, it has been killing its way into China step by step, and China has been retreating step by step. Why is China retreating step by step? Because China is sixty or seventy years behind Japan in progress, and China's national strength cannot stop Japan's invasion. So, what has been China's diplomatic and internal policy since the September 18th Incident? In summary, diplomatically, we cannot stop Japan from killing its way in step by step, but we can only think of ways to make it advance more slowly. China cannot but retreat step by step, and can only think of ways to make us retreat more slowly. Why do we want to slow down? Do we want to take this opportunity to seek temporary peace and survive? No, we just want to take advantage of this slowness to free up some time to do various preparatory work in internal affairs to strengthen our resistance. This has been China's diplomatic and internal policy since the September 18th Incident."</p>
<p>Chairman Wang then explained the success of the government's construction in both spiritual and material aspects after the signing of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement and the Tanggu Armistice Agreement. However, what is this "success" for? Chairman Wang said: "We are the people of a weak country. What we call resistance has no other content. Its content is only sacrifice. We want to turn every soldier and every piece of land into ashes so that the enemy cannot get anything into their hands. This meaning is indeed harsh, but if we don't do this, there will be even harsher things following behind. In essence, if we don't sacrifice, then we will only be puppets." It is to make the whole country devoid of anything, for the final sacrifice.</p>
<p>We agree to sacrifice, and we are preparing our weapons and lives to fight the enemy. But the end of our sacrifice is to seek survival. Our creed is not to seek survival by retreating, but to seek survival by sacrificing. At the same time, we hope that the government can transform the tenacious spirit of enduring humiliation and retreating repeatedly for the past six years into a tenacious spirit of resistance throughout. Then, our resistance will never be a desperate resistance of trapped beasts, nor will it be a resistance of defeatists where every soldier and every piece of land becomes ashes. We are a war of liberation, a war to build a new country and maintain world peace. Our friends are all over the world at the lowest levels!</p>
<h3>The Last Lesson</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>On the morning of July 8, Wanping County, which was in a sweet sleep, was suddenly awakened by a burst of urgent gunfire.</p>
<p>"The Japanese soldiers are drilling again!" This was the thought that rolled through the minds of everyone who was awakened from their dreams. But ever since the Twenty-Ninth Army retreated to Lugouqiao last year, the Japanese soldiers' wanton behavior in Wanping had become commonplace. The people of our own country are not up to par, so who can the common people resent? It's called drilling, but they are armed with live ammunition. The bean fields are trampled, the houses are pierced with holes, and being hit with rifle butts is even more common. But what can the common people do? They hate it in their hearts, but they have to close their doors and sit at home waiting for death.</p>
<h3>The World of Running Dogs</h3>
<p>— (By Wang Mei)</p>
<p>At this moment, in a small school in the county town, the bell for waking up had just rung. Hearing the urgent sound of gunfire, the old tea room attendant deliberately rang the bell with force, as if to vent his frustration.</p>
<p>The students all jumped out of bed. They all liked to secretly peek at the Japanese soldiers' drills, and almost every elementary school student had learned practices such as "kneel down" and "charge," sometimes dividing into two teams, A and B, in the playground, representing China and the Japanese, and fighting each other.</p>
<p>The principal was a scholar in his fifties, his hair already graying, but he was happy to stand and watch, nodding, at his students' subconscious patriotic performances.</p>
<p>But today, when the elementary school students gathered on the upper floors to watch the Japanese drills, the principal ran to stop them, ordering them to go to the church, and canceling morning exercises for the day.</p>
<p>The students all obeyed the principal, as if listening to their father's instructions. They immediately and quickly went to the church, sitting down without a sound, as if sensing an impending terror.</p>
<p>The principal stood upright at the teaching desk, silent for a long time, forgetting how to begin to tell his beloved elementary school students the ominous news he had received last night.</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire rang out again, and every pair of small eyes looked at each other, surprised and afraid, hoping that the principal would explain it to them immediately.</p>
<p>"This is the last lesson!"</p>
<p>The principal said these words with all his strength, but he couldn't continue immediately, and two lines of clear tears hung from his eyes.</p>
<p>"Children, this is the last lesson!" he repeated, "Last night, the Japanese, under the pretext of a missing soldier, demanded to enter the city for inspection... This is Chinese land, children, can we allow them to do this?..."</p>
<p>The children listened quietly, their eyes fixed on the principal's face, letting each of his heavy voice spread out.</p>
<p>"Of course not!" the principal clenched his fist, "They then opened fire to make trouble... and even bombarded our county town with artillery, but our loyal 29th Army has already returned fire..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, the principal unfolded the map on the wall and pointed with his finger to the terrain of Wanping and the Lugou Bridge, explaining, "Since the 1918" incident, our four eastern provinces have been seized, and last year they occupied Fengtai. The Japanese ambition is pressing closer step by step. Recently, they have wanted to pressure Beiping to achieve their long-cherished wish of controlling the entire North China. And to pressure Beiping, they must first seize the Lugou Bridge, because the Lugou Bridge is the throat of Beiping: to seize the Lugou Bridge, they must first seize Wanping, because Wanping is the guardian of the throat of Beiping..." The principal's voice rose higher and higher, almost drowning out the gunfire outside, "So, can we abandon Wanping, abandon the Lugou Bridge?"</p>
<p>A sudden commotion, dozens of small mouths shouting the same voice:</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Yes!" The principal nodded, as if taking a breath, "Now, our loyal 29th Army is vowing to live and die with the bridge, and County Magistrate Wang has already ordered the city to be defended, and to continue the war of resistance after the reinforcements arrive. This is the final moment for the Chinese nation, every Chinese person should participate in the work of national salvation, so, I say today is the last lesson!"</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The church was temporarily silent, but it felt as if an explosive powder was permeating the air. The principal slowly rolled up the map.</p>
<p>"We are scholars, so naturally we cannot go to the front line to kill the enemy, but the rear needs us to provide assistance to those loyal brothers. We must immediately organize a comfort team to fulfill our responsibility as citizens, to comfort our brothers resisting the enemy. Children, who is willing to participate, raise your hand."</p>
<p>Countless hands were raised simultaneously, and strong hearts were connected to each other.</p>
<p>A Bloody Tragedy</p>
<p>This tragedy is too bloody! I believe I will never forget it, never, ever!</p>
<p>Perhaps it's my hobby: I like to stand on that product of civilization - that high, solid iron bridge, crisscrossed by cars and trams, looking at the yellow, polluted Huangpu River water, and indulge in solitary thoughts for a while.</p>
<p>It was a little after 2 pm on the 30th. I was passing by Tilanqiao on business, so I leaned on the iron railing again, looking down at the yellow river water. A few small boats, loaded with watermelons, were rowing east. Actually, I wouldn't pay attention to these figures at all. My mind was full of all kinds of thoughts. That day, I was pondering over that Tianjin telegram - the one I saw in the morning paper. The telegram said: "The Japanese army in Tianjin city took kerosene and set fires everywhere! When residents tried to escape outside, the Japanese army at the street corners used machine guns to strafe them!" At that time, I refused to believe that the news was true. Because in the present 20th century, especially the imperial army of a civilized nation like Japan, would never commit such savage and barbaric acts as primitive people! Perhaps it was a rumor? Perhaps it was fabricated by the news agency? Or perhaps the telegram was translated incorrectly? While my mind was indulging in all sorts of bizarre thoughts, suddenly, a "grinding" sound rose behind me. I quickly turned around to see what was happening. I saw a ×× armored car speeding up from under the bridge. So: the tram stopped; the cars stopped; pedestrians frantically and hurriedly fled to both sides of the bridge, and the armored car drove over even more urgently! When it was about to reach the end of the bridge, the bloody tragedy unfolded!</p>
<p>Oh my God! What a tragic scene! A woman, about forty years old, was already lying in the blood under the iron wheels of the armored car! The bright red blood was still gushing upwards! At this time, those who were afraid of trouble were afraid that disaster would befall them, and had already run away; the timid also hid in the corners of the bridge, not daring to come out; a few foreign cars passed by, and they poked their heads out of the windows to take a look, then sneered a few times and ordered their drivers to continue forward. Just at this moment - when the armored car was about to drive away, an Indian constable suddenly came and shouted loudly for it to stop! Who knew that a ×× soldier in the armored car also jumped out quickly, his face ferocious, drew a pistol with one hand, pointed it at the Indian constable's chest, and said something in a language I didn't understand. The meaning was that he wanted the Indian constable to let him drive away, otherwise he would shoot him dead! The Indian constable wasn't flustered either, he drew his pistol, opened the safety, and also pointed it at the ×× soldier's chest, bravely saying, "You shoot! If I die, you die too!" Sure enough, the ×× soldier yielded. The car number was copied down by the Indian constable, and the ×× soldier was also taken away by the Indian constable! When the ambulance came to carry away the injured woman, she had already lost more blood! It looked like she was about to die!</p>
<p>At this time, many compatriots came to help. They all helped to carry the injured person into the car. Is this the compassion of us Chinese people?</p>
<p>At that time, I remembered a story, which said: "A Chinese person scolded an Indian constable, saying, 'You slave of a subjugated country!' But the Indian constable calmly retorted to the Chinese compatriot who scolded him, saying, 'You're not much different'!" These words were originally intended to insult us, and we would never admit to the 'almost' of being 'not much different' from a 'slave of a subjugated country'! Now, unexpectedly, the Indian constable, a 'slave of a subjugated country', dared to bravely draw his pistol and make a righteous resistance to the ferocious and evil ×× soldier, while we Chinese, who are not yet 'slaves of a subjugated country', and whose own compatriots are sacrificed, dare not protest to the ×× soldier. How shameful is this! However, one might also say: we have no weapons and cannot resist him. Then why don't the senior military generals in North China, who possess heavy troops, dare to make a righteous resistance to the ×× soldier? Compared to that Indian constable who is already a 'slave of a subjugated country', what will they be like?</p>
<p>The Tianjin telegram that I had been hesitating about quickly led me to decide that it was indeed true. Think: in Shanghai, where sovereignty is still autonomous, the ×× soldiers are still so brutal, regarding the lives of Chinese people as worthless. Then in the fallen Pingjin, the lives of Chinese people are certainly even less important!</p>
<p>Readers: don't be fortunate that the one who died a violent death was not you, nor your wife, sister, mother, or even your relatives and friends. You must know! Today, or tomorrow, this cruel fate may befall you. Your blood, your flesh, will not arouse their mercy. They are vicious beasts, they are demons who kill without blinking an eye! They want to eat your flesh and drink your blood. No one can escape this tragic calamity, unless we, the weak, unite and resist him with force, and beat him to death! Only then will we have a way to live, only then can we live! Otherwise, this tragic fate will eventually come one day! We will eventually be eaten of our flesh and sucked of our blood and die one day! We are still alive now, and this is only a matter of time!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I passed by Tilanqiao again, and those ×× armored cars were still running as fast as lightning. Fortunately, I dodged a little faster, otherwise, wouldn't I have been sacrificed by the foremost armored car?</p>
<p>A "cattle herding" child on the bridge warmly advised me: "Next time you have to be careful! You better run faster! ×× people don't pay for killing people! Didn't they run over an old woman yesterday?"</p>
<p>I nodded sadly. (Jin Ge)</p>
