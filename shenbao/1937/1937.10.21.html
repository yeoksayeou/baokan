<h3>敵分數路進窺大塲我猛烈反攻敵已不支</h3>
<p>公路綫我仍扼守陳家宅俞家宅　黃港附近戰事最烈敵陣地動搖　廟行以北惡戰我軍進逼嚴家灣</p>
<p>（本報今晨三時接得前綫戰報）蕰藻浜南滬太公路以西由黃家宅沿公路南犯之敵軍、被我擊退後、卽盤擄於黃家宅至長棘樓下附近一帶、在昨日下午四時前、未敢進犯、但四時以後、敵增調援軍、補充軍實已畢、卽分兩路來攻、一由公路東面譚家灣宅·長棘樓下之綫、向東猛撲我高荏橋宅、一由公路以西黃家宅向南猛撲我陳家宅·俞家宅、我軍立卽當起衝殺、激戰至晚間八時許、敵以傷亡重大、狼狽潰退、我軍仍扼守陳家宅至長荏樓下陣地、待機進襲、公路以西葛家牌樓宅至黃港一綫敵軍、被我東南西三面包圍後、已勢窮力竭、無法進展、我軍遂於晚間八時起、配備輕重武器、三面同時反攻、我砲兵以密結砲火、猛射敵陣、同時我方空軍、亦奉令出動助戰、當卽展開空前激戰、我軍將士莫不浴血前進、奮勇萬分、槍聲密如聯珠、砲聲隆隆不絕、至十時後、戰事更趨激烈、黃港方面敵軍陣地、已有動搖狀態、似已陷於苦戰之中、雖不斷以砲火向我猛轟、企圖壓迫我軍前進、但終不能减少我軍勇氣、預料不難將該處頑敵擊潰、自張家牌樓至丁家橋宅·陳家巷之綫、我方工事、堅固非常、兵力十分雄厚、敵雖不斷由蕰藻浜南分頭來犯、希圖分散我方兵力、但結果均遭我軍痛擊而退、又滬太公路以東蕰藻浜南岸、除沿浜如譚家灣·嚴家彎·北楊宅·等處被敵突進外、其餘沿南岸之綫、直至廟行東北面之孫宅為止、均為我軍所固守、並據我方軍事長官稱、大塲以北、蕰藻浜以南、自極東之孫宅起、迄西至浜北之陳家巷止、兩翼陣地、工事堅固、實力雄厚、敵欲中央突擊、奪取大塲、直等夢想耳、</p>
<p>兩軍主力戰、截至昨晚、尚未結束、以敵集淞滬精銳、圖最後一逞、在我方則洞燭敵之陰謀、為保衛江灣閘北計、固非堅守蕰藻浜南不可、故雙方一面鏖戰、一面仍調兵遣將、醖釀未來大戰、㊀昨日下午二時許、敵用坦克車三十餘輛、飛機十餘架、掩護步兵六千人、又越葑村塘進犯、傍晚將我軍壓迫至葛家牌樓、六時、預備該處之我生力軍、俟敵迫近、卽構成火網、全綫施行反攻、至八時許、我軍甚佔優勢、敵退壩石橋宅、十時左右、我軍復由俞家宅·陳家宅·及趙家角·牆門頭·左右兩路會同正面同時夾擊、敵勢不支、迨午夜敵又退回葑村塘以北、敵死傷五百餘人、被我擊毀坦克車二輛、敵遺棄槍械、我方正在收拾中、㊁嚴家灣之敵、蟄伏多日、昨晚六時半、忽又蠢動、先雙方砲戰約二小時、繼敵以三千人進犯、經我軍沿閘楊路在紫陽浜附近發生激戰、我軍甚爲强勁、業已將敵壓迫至嚴家灣相近、㊂頓悟寺我軍、昨日曾屢以小隊活動、沿橋亭宅·小廣宅·向敵進襲、敵每處恒用小型坦克車三四輛、阻我前進、八時九時後、雙方砲戰甚烈、</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜南之敵四路進犯未得逞</h3>
<p>黃港附近相持卅小時以上敵企圖向東面發展甚明顯</p>
<p>敵軍在蕰藻浜南岸、雖有進展、但隨處遭遇强力之抵抗、其進展之緩、傷亡之重、非敵軍始料所及、刻敵已被阻於黃港及俞家宅兩點、昨晨起、敵機又大肆活動、在蕰藻浜南公路東西各處投彈、幾數百枚、至晚八時半、據中央社隨軍記者報告時、尚盤旋不去、而敵軍大砲亦密如兩下、在此方約四公里之區內、砲火彌漫、血肉橫飛、慘酷之景象、有非筆墨所能形容者、敵在飛機大砲掩護之下、向我兩翼陣地不斷衝擊、但我忠勇將士、浴血抗戰、扼守原陣絕未稍却、茲將各處情形、及本報所得前晚昨晨之戰訊、併誌於後、</p>
<p>四路進犯均未得逞</p>
<p>昨日該區內共有四處激戰、其最激烈者、係在黃港附近、敵我相持、已達卅小時以上、惟我軍始終扼守湖裏宅至盛家宅之綫、嚴阻敵軍之西進、其在劉行大場公路旁之陳家宅敵於昨日（廿日）午後四時、猛烈進犯、經我軍死力抵禦、迄晚陣地無變化、其他兩處、則在浜之沿岸、敵軍以一路西犯我陳家巷·丁家橋宅·張家樓·桃園浜·之綫、先後衝鋒二次、均為我軍擊退、另一路由譚家灣宅·花園宅·進犯我陸宅·膏荏橋宅·之綫、亦未得逞、</p>
<p>前晚昨晨血戰情况</p>
<p>大塲北面戰事、自前晚至昨晨十時前、其重心仍在滬太公路兪家宅左右兩綫、尤以公路以西葛家牌樓宅至蘇家宅一帶為最激烈、敵車目的、以戰車沿公路直撲大塲正面、另以主力衝擊小池園蘇家宅、企圖突破大塲南翔間之公路、壓迫我軍後路、故敵軍於突進葛家牌樓宅後、復於前日傍晚起、調集大批强頑步兵、在其大砲密射之下、由黃港方面、向我蘇家宅·小池園·陣地、猛力衝擊、以尖角形之陣勢、激烈進撲、我軍以此路有關大塲之得失、乃調遣精銳部隊、分左右兩翼向敵包抄、會同蘇家宅正面圍攻、當卽展開空前血戰、至昨晨八時止、敵軍四次衝鋒、我軍三面廝殺前仆後繼、有進無退、故敵軍屢次猛衝、均遭痛擊、死傷過半而退、我方亦有相當損失、敵終以傷亡慘重、於昨晨八時後、退集黄港一帶、被我三面包圍中、敵因該綫我方勢必反攻、且駐有重兵、故在葛家牌樓宅附近趕築工事、又沿公路正面黃家宅方面之敵、昨以坦克車三十輛、分向東南面蘇家林宅·俞家宅我軍陣地、掩護大隊敵兵、猛力進撲、並有敵機多架、投彈轟炸、當時我後方援軍以敵軍火力過密、未能趕上致有一部陣地、被其突破、黃昏後我軍始分途反攻、血戰通宵、敵之坦克車、被我迫擊砲摧燬三輛、乃於昨晨拂曉前、不支潰退回黃家宅以北、自天明至十時、敵未敢來犯、我軍仍在沿滬太公路之兪家宅陳家宅以北陣綫堅守、陳家巷仍在我軍之手、前被突破之陣地、亦已修復、日將該處北面自頓悟寺至蔡家塘之間、一部陣地、亦經奪回、</p>
<p>敵軍企圖向東發展</p>
<p>敵軍在浜南之陣地、成一楔形、其底邊自公路西之牆門頭宅、至公路東之張兪宅、長為四千五百公尺、由黑大黃宅向南伸入、約二千公尺、以黃港為頂點、至在公路綫上、則南進約一千五百公尺結集兵力、已逹一師圑以上、現且源源增加、其在劉行方面之主力、已移至浜南、昨有千餘敵兵、集駐公路東相近我膏荏橋宅之長棘樓下附近叢林中、又有一聯隊、則向公路東沿浜之張兪宅增援、迄晚雖尚無舉動、惟敵向公路東面發展之企圖、固甚明顯矣、</p>
<h3>廟行北面激戰</h3>
<p>我軍逼近嚴家灣</p>
<p>中央社江灣隨軍記者二十一日晨零時三十分報告、沉寂三日之廟行前綫、昨晚六時半、在該處北面又發生激戰、敵約四千人、由蕰藻浜沿岸嚴家灣方面來犯、敵軍大砲、驚破沉寂之空氣、而揭開惡戰、我亦以大砲還擊、互轟約兩小時、我軍大隊、冒砲火沿閘楊路挺進、在紫陽浜左近、開始血戰、我軍反復衝鋒、經幾度之肉搏、已逼近嚴家灣、繼續推進、報告時、激戰尚在進行中</p>

<p>自朱家宅推進八百公尺</p>
<p>中央社廣福隨軍記者二十日午十二時五十分報告、昨日午後起、敵間歇以大砲向我施相公廟左右轟擊、至晚七時、楊涇練祁塘之交點處、遂發生激戰、敵坦克車二輛掩護一聯隊之兵力來力、來犯我朱家宅北周宅之綫、敵雖猛力衝鋒、但均為我擊退、相持在八小時以上、進出達四五次、殲敵約二百餘、至今晨（二十日）七時、我步步追擊、向東南推進八百公尺、已抵吳家宅杜宅之間、聲勢甚盛、尚在不斷追擊中、</p>
<h3>江灣我軍包圍擊敵</h3>
<p>敵向其美路退却</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者二十一日晨零时三十分报告、昨日我軍圍擊泗涇塲之敌、甚為得手、故昨日午後五时、我又由體育會路徑翔投路向復旦大學之東南、以大包圍之形勢、向敵進擊、至晚九時、前哨接觸、卽發生激戰晚九時、前哨接觸、即發生激戰、經我奮勇衝殺、斃敵六七十人、敵猶勉力支持兩小時、不敢戀戰、乃向其美路方面退去、至於其他各處、均甚沉寂、惟聞持志大學及廣東街方面、有前哨小接觸、從遠處傳來、隆隆之砲聲中、偶有尖鋭之步槍聲、以爲點綴耳、</p>
<h3>廣福擊落敵機一架</h3>
<p>昨日午後、敵機一架、為我高射砲擊中受損、降落於廣福鎮西南我軍陣地內、機件完好、惟機師已匿避、刻我正在搜索緝捕中、</p>
<p>中央社廣福隨軍記者二十日午前十一時半報告、今日拂曉、敵由廣福附近之老徐宅趙宅向我進犯、我軍沉着抗戰、並不衝出、旋由砲兵集中轟擊、連發五十餘枚、命射精確、斃敵頗多、敵知不可犯、旋亦退去、</p>
<h3>我空軍又燬敵彈庫</h3>
<p>楊樹浦定海路第四百四十九弄內第六百三十一號至六百三十六號、為日商裕豐紗廠廠址、最近敵軍因各軍火貯藏處、被我空軍先後炸燬、乃將大部軍火及新近運到之彈藥等、移貯裕豐紗廠工房內、且有大隊敵兵、集藏屋內、但仍被我軍偵悉、昨晚我空軍飛滬助戰時、曾往該處投彈、均行命中、被我炸燬工房六間、炸爆之聲、震驚四野、並曾起火燃燒、敵方損失奇重、死傷又衆、詳情待續、</p>
<p>中央社云、浦中敵艦、於昨夜十一時及今晨零時半一時半、又起三次紛擾、惟其高射砲聲似甚稀疏而無力、其探照燈光亦僅二三道、向空搜索、其時我機係由滬西經過而未飛至浦江及楊樹浦投彈云、</p>
<h3>敵艦又向浦東開砲</h3>
<p>敵輪竊煤被我擊退</p>
<p>停泊九號浮筒之敵砲艦一艘、於今晨（二十日）八時左右、突又向我浦東發砲、猛烈轟擊、同時另有敵小輪三艘、徐徐馭靠浦東新三井碼頭、企圖登陸、竊取該處煤棧之燃料、我守軍洞燭其奸、於敵艦開砲時、皆置之不理、靜待敵小輪逼近岸旁後、遂以機關槍密集掃射、敵見我早有準備、相率倉皇遁去、惟已被我射擊死傷十餘人、</p>
<h3>空中警戒防我夜襲</h3>
<p>夜間敵機巡邏滬東上空</p>
<p>自我空軍不時來滬夜襲後、滬東區一帶敵軍根據地、所受損失頗鉅、敵遂於前晚起、每晚必派機二隊共六架、往來飛翔于滬東區上空、以為警戒、防我夜襲、</p>
<h3>敵援軍又到六千人</h3>
<p>將繼續增援三師團來滬</p>
<p>日方為轉移國際視綫及挽回國譽起見、擬在本月三十日九國公約會議開幕以前、限令攻克以前淞滬協定以內非駐兵區域、故已另由陸軍省增調三師團以上之軍隊、約五萬餘人來滬參戰、聞該批援軍、將於二十六日到滬、</p>
<p>昨日拂曉、有敵商輪改建之運輸艦共七艘駛抵滬、停靠吳淞鎮市輸渡碼頭三艘滿載戰馬及軍械、四艘滿載敵軍約五千餘人、當卽分別起卸上岸及登陸、由敵軍用卡車五十餘輛、分批運赴前方、查此次所到敵軍、為第六次增援軍中之第二批、再昨日下午三時、另有敵三三一號運輸艦和歌丸、載來大批炸彈、（用草包紥）在大阪碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>敵又駛到航空母艦</h3>
<p>並在砲台灣築臨時機場</p>
<p>確息、停泊吳淞口三峽水海面之敵艦、除巡洋艦砲艦多艘外、航空母艦原僅一艘、本月十八日晨、又另有敵航空母艦一艘駛到、故現泊淞口之敵航空母艦已增至兩艘、此外敵在吳淞砲台灣附近、亦已築成一臨時飛機塲、據昨自淞口來滬之某外人談、渠曾目睹在吳淞水產學校左近、停有敵機二十餘架、另有敵機三架、正自該處起飛、</p>
<h3>敵方迭次誣我用毒瓦斯毫無事實根據</h3>
<p>軍政部發言人鄭重聲明　我抗戰决不用非法手段</p>
<p>［南京］邇來敵方在滬迭次聲言我軍使用毒瓦斯、本月十八日晚復向外國記者發表公報、為同樣誣妄之宣傳、頃據我軍政部發言人稱、敵人此種卑鄙伎倆、早為世界識者所唾棄、當上週敵方揚稱曾獲我毒氣彈與其機機時、外國記者當塲質問、是否在化騐時得有中立國技師之見許、敵無詞答對、卽日外務省發言人受路透社記者詢問時、亦承認尚無事實足以證明日軍曾受毒氣、觀此足見敵方此種武斷宣傳、實無絲毫事實之根據、其迭次散播上項空氣者、殆為再度對我施用毒瓦斯之先聲、茲特鄭重聲明、我軍抗戰决不採用非法手段、倘使敵人再稱其官兵遭受毒氣、當請其如我國之例、交由第三國正式醫生為之證明、否則以後敵復發表此等反宣傳之讕言、均為共誣妄之词、不辯自明云、（二十日中央社電）</p>
<h3>敵機昨日四出轟炸</h3>
<p>閘北浦東滬西南市　炸毀燃燒民房頗多</p>
<p>昨日敵機續飛閘北·浦東·眞如·大塲·等處作竟日轟炸、各情如次、</p>
<p>閘北</p>
<p>閘北方面於昨晨十時起即有敵軍轟炸機三架飛至新民路大統路上空、在新民路一帶投三彈、毀民房二十餘間、旋又飛長安路南昌路一帶投彈九枚、烏鎮路光復路帶投燒夷彈七八枚、彈落火起、燃燒頗烈、十一時半該機又東飛、在寶山路商務印書錧附近投二彈、該處民房、中彈起火、燃燒亦烈、下午一時起、又有敵機三架、飛蒙古路·大統路·寶山路商務印書館一帶、續肆轟炸、被炸起火者、有三處、旋該敵機等復飛北站上空、在兩路管理局大廈投燒夷彈二枚、該厦因係竊骨水泥構成除最上層被炸起火、燃燒約數十分鐘外、其餘無何損失、</p>
<p>大塲</p>
<p>昨晨六時起、在八字橋·大塲·眞如一带、即有敵机多架、在上列数處輪流作竟日轟炸、其投彈總數不下百餘枚尤以大塲為最多、然因敵機機的欠準、除有數十彈投中我民房、因以被毀外、餘多落於出野、於我軍事上固無絲毫損失也、</p>

<h3>中國走向民主途中</h3>
<p>— 宋慶齡</p>
<p>孫夫人宋慶齡女士於昨日清晨七時十三分、在上海美商R·C·A·廣播電臺、發表播音演說、由該電臺播送美國各處、題曰“中國走向民主的途中”、聞美國無綫電聽衆數千萬人、均可直接收得此項播音、茲錄演說詞如下、</p>
<p>我有這一個機會、向美國人士訴說在我們中國人心中感到焦灼的問題、實在非常快慰、</p>
<p>我在美國渡過我靑年時代、受過美國偉大的民主傳統的薰染、它已經成為我生活中偉大的力量之一、它的文化成為我所接受的敎育的一部分、這對於我祖國、十分需要民主精神的祖國、是非常珍貴的、因此、我現在對靑年時代所寄居的國家訴說時、並不感覺到是以陌生人的地位和諸君接觸、却知道我的呼籲、一定可以獲得你們的了解和響應、一如美國向在對華態度所慷慨表現的那樣、</p>
<p>中國已發動抗戰、抗拒非言語所能補述的慘無人道的侵略者、夢想實現法西斯侵略迷夢的日本軍閥又以死亡感毀滅加於我們的國土、看到了中國人民每大遭遇恐怖的消息、誰不能爲之駭絶呢、目覩忍心轟炸無辜婦孺的野蠻行動、誰能不立誓撲滅這萬惡的罪犯呢、明明知道在我們每個城市中屠殺非戰鬥員對於軍事目標上並無必要那末、對於這種不僅威脅中國、並且威脅全世界文明的公敵、離還能保持消極的態度呢、所謂日本的開明首相近衛文歷竟說“日本的唯一方法是鞭撻中國、使之屈膝、使不再有戰鬥的精神”這種殘酷的言詞更放了嗜殺成性的日本軍問、</p>
<p>日本其他的外交家、是更為狡猾而欠坦白了、他們這樣詭辯他們所要求的只是中國應該充分了解他們提出的“合作”建議為報答他們的盛意起見、祇要中國照他們的意思把我們的歷史改造一下就行了、抗日思想應該從我們的生活中及敎科書中排除盡凈、他們的野蠻行為、應該由我們解釋為奉力承命的神聖事蹟、我只能讓世界人士想一想、這是怎樣荒誕的一回事情啊、就是在日本、這種防禦的宣傳中、也包含着對於美國本身的威脅、同時、任何國家、凡感到中國人民因日本種種暴行而飽嘗着無上的苦痛、也應該認為是一種威脅、英·美·以及各國人士、幾於一致的激動、表明全世界對於這些野蠻人類的普通譴責、美國方面自發的反日情緒、不免引起日本軍閥腍峻的注意、憎悵你們沒有合作的精神、目前日本的威脅、雖僅加於中國、但誰能保證到了某種時候、這樣奇特的態度、不會從行動上危害其地民族呢、</p>
<p>幾十年來、日本帝國主義不斷侵略中國、攫取我們的土地不談遠的最近六年來日本帝國主義的侵略、現在已經發展為進攻華北·上海·而逮到了中國生死存亡的最後關頭、全世　界總還能記得東北三省的被侵佔、一九三二年的上海戰爭、和日本帝國主義以挑陰謀屠殺等手段、而漸次進入熱河·察哈爾·與冀北美國號召全世界列强舉行華盛頓會議使日本接受尊重中國領土與行政完整以及門戶開放政策的條約、可是、白利安·凱洛格·非戰公約和九國公約的簽字國、却萎縮地坐視這些條約被簽字國之一的日本所撕毀、對於日本軍閥征服中國的瘋狂的冒險行動、並不設法加以阻止、被每個日本軍閥認爲是聖經的田中奏摺、是放在一切條約之前的日本征服全亞洲的既定計劃、全世界人士、對於這一點、是不是還需要我們來提醒呢</p>
<p>中國爲什麽貧弱、日本爲甚麽能夠在中國領土內橫行、這一問題、很難用幾句話來解說清楚、扼要脫來、十年來我們中國的虛弱無力、是由於內部的磨擦與自相殘殺所致、一九二三年到一九二七年、在孫中山先生領導之下、普及全國的偉大的國民革命運動、將全國統一起來、而成為偉大的團結的民族之開端舊軍閥一個個被打倒、在孫中山先生的指示之下、中國已走上了完成堅强而民主的國家的道路、但孫先生的去世使中華民族遭遇了極大的不幸、他的遺敎與三民主義、在連年的內戰中消聲匿跡、自相殘殺的結果、使國家受到破壞、人民大衆的生活、日陷貧困、因此日本才能夠攫取我們東北四省、再繼續侵略我們的土地、我們內部的分裂、僅使日木坐收漁翁之利、</p>
<p>七月中旬、日本續派大軍到華北它又企圖攫取我們的另一大塊領土同時則以長江流域為第二個目標、在上海駐屯了大批的軍隊、企圖佔據上海及附近各地、以便推動更進一步的侵略、可是它却失敗了、中國人民、以勇武的决心和血肉之軀、抵抗侵略者的巨艦·大砲·飛機·和機械化部隊、敵人的轟炸、毁滅了我們的城市·學校·圖畫館·和其他文化機關、敵人任意屠殺我們的婦女兒童、使每一個中國老百姓都感覺到日本的瘋狂和無理性、不管日本軍閥是怎樣的瘋狂、不管日本軍閥的威力怎樣、我敢代替全中國人民堅决地告訴你們、日本軍閥必定在我們的領土上遭遇滅亡中國人都準備以最後的犧牲來保衛祖國、我們全體民衆的義憤、儘足以補償軍器上的差遞而有餘、</p>
<p>過去三作中、反日運動的力量、已大大的增加、這幾年來、我們的工人·農人·和知識份子、紛紛在救亡團體中聯合起來、組織全國的抗戰、同時、民族意識也隨着這一個運動而物質、我們已覺悟到中國的偉大民族是不能分裂的一個整體、足以粉碎日本的任何陰謀、當日軍向我們進攻、敵機向我們無辜平民濫施轟炸的時候、全國各黨各派各集團、就都忘記了過去的一切爭執、聯合起來組成一個堅强的陣綫展開神聖的民族解放戰爭、內戰是早經終止了、一切內部的磨擦、是已經消除了、勢不兩立的蔣委員長和朱德將軍、也在南京言歸於好了、這次日本帝國主義的新進攻、竟成了結合全中國一切資源和力量以抵抗暴敵的媒介劑、過去的紅軍、即現在的第八路軍、已是記軍的一部分、正加入作戰、第一次與敵軍接觸、就獲得壓倒一切的勝利、我們全國的團結統一、已發生偉大的力量、如堡壘一樣堅固、給予侵略者以迎頭的痛擊、</p>
<p>如果必要的話、我們自然當以自己的力量單觸來抗拒日本的法西斯侵略者、可是我們已經聽到了全世界的同情之聲、因此、慶幸我們雖在苦難的期間、却並不孤立全世界對於日本劊子手的暴行的譴責、給予我們苦難的同胞以許多安慰、我深信美國對於我國爭取自由與獨立的奮鬥、必然表示懇切的同情、我們知道我們並不是在孤軍抗戰、我們知道、我們發動反抗這些法西斯暴徒的戰爭不單是為了我們自己、也是為了一切仍舊愛護自由民主的人們你們憎恨這些法西斯魔鬼、因而自發地願意抵制一切日貨、這對於我們還有許多迫切的要求、請你們不要讓任何一隻船從美國開往日本去、因為日本可以把你們任何出產物加以改造來對付我們、金錢上的帮助、對於我們的戰爭、固然是重要的、但更重要的是请你們源源不断地輸送軍械軍火來充實我們的軍隊、我們要有强有力的軍隊來抵禦强有力的敵人、我希望美國公正輿論的呼聲和儘力、傳達到全世界去、美國是用不着参加戰爭來毀灭這遠東的法西斯威脅的、羅斯福總統令人感動的演詞、扼要地說出了全世界對於這國際惡棍的暴行、都加以道德上的譴責、請你們一致擁護羅斯福總統的演説、使他的話能够見諸行動、趁殘酷的火燄、尚未延燒到全世界各國之前、將它撲滅、我　請美國人士起來領導這個神聖的十字軍、我深信你們不會使我們失望、</p>

<h3>在轟炸中来去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>十二</p>
<p>二十五日的首都特別晴朗了。一大淸早起來便有人在說，今天恐怕有敵機來襲。果然，在九點鐘左右，我正要乘汽東去訪汪先生的時候，同居的人說，警報來了。——這警報在我半聾的耳裏，實在什麽也沒有聽見。</p>
<p>不一會又是緊張急警報，於是同居的人都一齊跑向對山下的土壕裏去避難，他們都很關切我，呌我進最深處去坐。壕是因山鎜成的，除有進口外沒有通氣的氣孔，坐在壕裏做了一會兩脚老鼠，實在有點氣悶，我又移到了近口處來。高射砲在轟隆地響着。</p>
<p>季惺和銘德是上報館去了的，季惺有一位兄弟呌友海，還在高中讀書。這位小朋友很活潑，穿着一套黃色帆布的中山裝，戴着一副黑色的做翻羔羊角般的擴音器，站在進口的階段上瞭望空中的情形，一一向壕裏的人報吿。壕裏有一人向我說：友海是我們的哨兵。</p>
<p>—他很有趣，等我也來替你們當個哨兵！我說着也就率性站上階段上去了。</p>
<p>—郭先生，你下來，危險。壕裏的人在說。</p>
<p>—郭先生，你下去，危險，壕外的友海在說。</p>
<p>—把你那聽器給我好了。我後有聽從他們，只向友海索求他那對倒翻羔羊角。</p>
<p>友海把聽器替我套上了。聲音是要聽得大些。</p>
<p>高射砲和敵機的角逐眞是可觀。</p>
<p>據我所看見的說，開始是有十一架敵機飛來，山南轉向東城去預備散開，四處埋伏的高射砲一時一時震天價響亮，砲烟在敵機的隊中穿揷。烟雲和機影密接着，不易辨別淸楚</p>
<p>忽然有一聲砲響得特別着實，敵機隊中的第十架帶着一股黑烟，像彗星一樣墜落了。</p>
<p>—打得好，眞打得好！敵機墜落了一架。友海滿高興地向壕裏報吿。</p>
<p>敵機被打中了一架之後，其餘的散開了來，高射砲烟和它們角逐了一會，它们又各自逃竄了。</p>
<p>空中的音樂告了一次的中休。我和友海，索性離開了土　，踞在土丘上瞭望。街路上除掉警衛的士兵之外是一個行人也沒有的。一切的交通機關不用說是早已絕跡。</p>
<p>寂靜的街，萬籟無聲的海，但在道無聲之中有意志力的波濤澎湃。</p>
<p>不一會又有一隊敵機來了。這次是十五架，依然是由南而來，却轉向城西北去散開。高射砲烟更加肩摩踵接地和它們角逐。忽然又是一聲　別着實的砲響，敵機中的一架發出一朶紅光，紅光上冒着黑烟，又像一顆彗星一样，墜下了。</p>
<p>打得好，眞打得好！敵機又打落了一架！友海跳起來了，比剛才更加高興地向壕裏報吿着。</p>
<p>怎麽放紅光呢？我懷疑着問。</p>
<p>—那一定是打中了汽油槽。友海很內行地向我說。</p>
<p>被　落了的敵機落在城西北區去還買起了一陣火烟。</p>
<p>其它的敵機慌慌忙忙地亂飛了一陣，又逃竄了。</p>
<p>很有好一會，上天下地都凝寂着，没有聲響。</p>
<p>—眞是痛快，到了一次南京，親眼看見我們的空中戰，並親眼看見我們的高射砲打落兩架敵機，眞是痛快·我自己對友海遠懷着。</p>
<p>—高射砲打中飛機是不容易的舉體，我也是今天才親眼看見。</p>
<p>—怎麽不看見我們的飛機來呢？</p>
<p>—我們的飛機是在城外和敵作戰，堵截敵機，如敵機竄入了城空，便用高射砲射擊。在城空作戰，弄得流彈橫飛，對於市民是相當危險。</p>
<p>友海好像是很明白作戰過程的一樣，確否不得而知，好在是年靑人隨便的談話，姑且把它記錄在這兒。</p>
<p>警報期間特別長，太陽把頭壓得有點痛，戲弄得有點不能忍耐了。</p>
<p>—我看得看是快要解除約的，我們回去吧。我向友海　促着。</p>
<p>—好的，大概是快會解除了。</p>
<p>友海陪着我剛好回到門口，他說：哦，你有先見之明，警報解除了。</p>
<p>他是聽見了解除警報的哨聲的，但我依然什麽也沒聽見</p>
<p>不一會壕裏的人也回來了，大家都笑逐顏開地十分快與</p>
<p>接着又是新民報館銘德來電話，這電話中所報吿的消息，更於大家的快與之中又增加了快與。</p>
<p>據說，這次的敵機的來襲，我機在城外和它堵截了好一會，竄進了城空的，只是其中的一部分。</p>
<p>又說，我們的高射砲，在浦口一砲連中了三機。怎麽連中了的呢？是因爲一砲打中了敵機的炸彈，炸彈爆裂了，自行打傷了兩架，一並墜落了下來。</p>
<p>一砲中三機在將來恐怕要成爲語。這比舊時的“一箭射雙雕”更來得摩登而可紀念。</p>
<p>敵人宣言，要把南京化爲灰燼。</p>
<p>我卻親眼看見，敵人在南京化爲了灰燼。</p>

<h3>敵人軍事上的第一次搖動</h3>
<p>— 金仲華</p>
<p>自從敵人對我大舉侵略以來，在時間上不過兩個半月，而因為作戰方面，並不能如預定的計劃，順利進展，在軍事上現在已顯示了第一個動搖的象徵·這象徵，最顯明的表現，是由於上海的五次總攻，都不能收得預期的效果，於是敵人國內的許多方面，立刻提出了‘非難’的意見，認為這樣的大擧侵略，犧牲過大，得不償失自然，在敵人的戰時嚴密新聞封鎖之下，這種內部搖動的消息，還不能顯明透露出來；但在敵人官方的新聞宣傳間，却已無意的顯示了這種搖動的象徵。</p>
<p>本月十七日下午三時東京無綫電播音，說有同盟社特社特派員謁見某海軍將官，在雙方的問答中，有如下的兩段：</p>
<p>‘問：上海戰綫最近動靜如何？</p>
<p>‘答：沒有什麼變動，日軍仍在陸海空軍恊力之下，照旣定計劃進行作戰。近來據聞國內人士一部分，有非難軍事行動不能迅速展開者，老實說一句，上海戰局因地形方面所限制，迅速進展，是談何容易呢？………</p>
<p>‘問：南方戰事如何？</p>
<p>‘答：南方戰事方針，主在轟炸。海面封鎖亦非常辛苦。兵士之辛苦，可說超過於實際。’</p>
<p>這兩段問答，實在大堪吾人回味。其中最足注意者，有下列三點·㊀日本國內，現在確實證明有人非難軍事進展的不能迅速。㊁日本軍事當局，已‘老實承認要迅速進展，决非易事。㊂日軍士兵作戰之‘辛苦’，已證明他們所感受的困難及苦痛，為局外所不能想像。</p>
<p>兩個半月的侵略，在敵人方面卽已暴露了軍事上的第一個搖動；則在長期侵略戰爭之中，種種搖動不安的滋長，更為當然的結果。老實說，以日本這樣一個經濟基礎薄弱的國家，要冒險進行持久的苦戰，它的國內人民所感受的苦痛，它在前途所包含的危機，真是不可思議的。在這點上，正也證明了我們持久抗戰前途的有把握。</p>
<p>我們更知道，日帝國主義的軍事凖備，本來以“速戰速决”為基礎。所以，在這次敵軍大舉對我侵略之初，近衛在對他國內人民的表示中，卽已一再聲明要迅速求得這戰爭的結束。後來敵軍一次次對上海總攻，軍事指揮者也總是劃定期限，要把我第一道防綫衝破。然而敵人的預期，結果却一次次的歸於失敗。於是在無可奈何之中，近衛與杉山不得不宣布這次的戰爭，將為長期的大戰，在一九三七年內，必無結束的希望。同時，在日本統治者對於他們國民所發表的談話中，也毫不掩飾這次冒險侵略對於日本帝國主義前途的嚴重性，有時甚至不惜加以過分的誇大，誘勸日本的被壓追大衆忍受犧性，支持這個侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>本月十五日，在日本臨時內閣參議人員町田，前田，秋田，安保，末次，松岡，　垣等接見記者的時候，前第三艦隊司令末次大將說：“目前時局比日俄戰役重大而且嚴重，日本非努力貫澈所期目的，收穫完美之結果，則前途非常危險。”（據十五日下午三時東京無綫電播音。）所謂“前途非常危險，一這正也是日帝國主義統治者的老實話·二個半月的全面戰爭，給與侵略者以第一個嚴重的警告。侵略者已經在搖動了！他們已經想見着對華侵略碰壁之後對於日帝國主義前途的悲劇了！</p>
<p>然而，雖然這樣說，我們知道在日帝國主義軍閥统治者的腦海中，却决不會有悔過的念頭。他們認為要貫澈侵略的目的，“收穫完美之結果，”才能避免前途的危險。所以他們這樣悲慘地狂呌，乃是要泣求日本勞苦大衆的忠心，不要起來革命，使他們的侵略事業能够忍痛支持下去而已。</p>
<p>在目前，在日帝國主義侵略機構遇到第一個挫折的時候，我們知道這搖動還不會促成它立卽的崩潰。但我們相信，只要我們堅决抗戰下去，則一次一次內部摇動現象的暴露，就是日帝國主義一聲一聲的落魂鐘。到最後，它的崩潰是不可避免的。</p>

<h3>加緊民衆組織</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>在對外戰爭中間。嚴密的民衆組織有着絕對的需要。是不消說得的。</p>
<p>現在各地政府所設立的保甲機構。黨部所領導的民衆團體。為了抗戰。似乎都在熱心地推進着工作。可是各地作戰部隊却還多數因得不到民衆的切實援助而訴苦。有的地方甚至漢奸密布。肆意搗亂。這是什麼緣故呢。</p>
<p>顯然。平時的民衆組織不够健全。所以現在儘管努力推進着工作。還是不能深入民衆。適應抗戰期間的需要。各地負責的政府和黨部。如不甘心誤國必須把這方面工作上所暴露的弱點。隨時痛切地檢討着克服着。尤須拋棄了所有的門。戶之見。儘量吸收富於才能的前進靑年。敎他們担當戰時的民衆組織的工作。</p>
<p>我們相信。各地大多數的同胞有着充分的抗敵意識。只要活潑幹練的組織人員。重新把他們嚴密地組織一番。就可發揮出非常堅强的力量來。</p>

<h3>抗戰期中女同胞應做的工作</h3>
<p>— 吳毓芳</p>
<p>我們知道：整個中華民族的解放戰爭己經展開了，我們必須要喚起全國的民衆，一致的動員起來，來參加這些救亡的抗戰運動，才能雊獲得最後的勝利。我想這是大衆多能夠明白的意義，在這里我所要提山的就是怎樣使我們全國二萬萬五千萬的婦女，都動員起來，担負起救亡圖存的抗戰使命。</p>
<p>自從華北及上海的抗戰發生之後，在前方服務的，除了一般的營救人員外，婦女們也起來踴躍的參加，如看護，慰勞，徵募，救濟歌詠等，都能夠表現出積極的服務精神，尤其是在上海的童子軍戰時服務團，裏面已有三百餘名女童子軍參加工作，這種新中國女子大無畏的精神，可以說是初次的發現。參加紅十字會的女隊員，她們也和男隊員一樣地勇敢冒着槍林彈雨在火綫上去搶救傷兵和難民，雖然敵人不顧國際公法，在眞如的東南醫院，當許多的童子軍及紅十字會的救護隊，在那裹工作的時候，敵人的飛機，就照凖了她們開機關槍掃射，死傷了幾個，可是她們還是前仆後繼的，勇敢地去執行她們應做的工作，參加救護工作的女童軍及紅十字會的女隊員，她們的工作是不分日夜地在那裹苦幹，忠實的服務，另一方面在傷兵醫院工作的女童軍，每天關於傷兵們的一切事情，都由她們在那裏料理，替傷兵寫書信，縫補衣服襪子，洗滌被褥，包紮偽口，唱愛國歌講述愛國故事，表演愛國短劇——等等，她們簡直使每一個傷兵遺忘了傷痕的痛苦，而得到無限的安慰·至於在難民收容所服務的女童軍們，她們也同樣地和難民們寫信，安慰家鄉的長老，有病的送入醫院，關於兒童的給養和產婦的調養，女童軍們都具有豐富的常識，都能夠應付週到在那裏，不論是傷兵或難民，甚至於一般的市民，看見女童軍們這樣體貼的忠賓服為，都會感激流涕的·這是直接給傷兵和難民們深切的同情。其他如徵募寒衣等工作，女童軍們，天天出發在馬路的弄堂內，向居民徵募，總是很晚的回來，始終不覺得辛苦，一個個都帶着興奮的精神，為難民們徵募了許多寒衣，她門的快樂，也可以說，是每一個難民快樂的種子。這一種精神，就是在外國也不多見，不僅僅表示出新中國女子的愛國熱忱，不在人後，而且更足以領導全國婦女們，將如潮水一般地向著救亡陣綫上街湧上去—</p>
<p>現在我們要使工作的效率更加偉大起見，不論在前綫，或後方的婦女們，應該一致的起來參加下面所講的抗戰工作：</p>
<p>㊀要鼓動戰士精神及救濟其家屬—我們不僅對於傷兵們施予醫治及慰勞，同時尤應對於他們的家屬予以相當的救濟，要聯絡集合所在地的婦女，來促起各地的婦女，一致的起來組織慰努團體，從事調查陣亡將士的家屬籍貫，住址及其經濟狀况，切實執行救濟事宜。</p>
<p>㊁訓練難民明瞭敵人的兇暴！難民收容所的設立，是暫時性的，遲早是必須耍把難民遣回原籍去，婦女團體就應該在難民收容所裏指示他們瞭解日帝國主義侵略的野心領導他們救亡圖存的道路，當他們回到鄉下去，至少可以發生較正確的官傳作用，同時訓練他們回鄉去發動各種救國工作。</p>
<p>㊂盡量參加生產工作—在此特久戰的局面之下，戰區內所有生產事業，不是停頓，就是被敵人破壞，將來戰事的擴大到如何程度，未可揣測，但大多數男子們是必須要上前綫去和敵人奮鬥的，那末，所有的工，商業，勢非靠婦女們起來繼續工作，不能調劑經濟，一方面由政府與實業家設法移動工商業到內地去，我們廣大的婦女們是責無旁貸的應該起來參加這民族工業的建設工作．此外如組織各種軍需供給品製造所，如防毒面具棉夾軍衣，其他毛織物等，我們有了製造所，方能源源不絕的供給，如農村的壯丁，或被調赴前綫，或被遣去受訓，則田間的種植事業，婦女們也應當担負起來。在此國難嚴重的關頭，我們婦女們應該盡量的到工廠去—到軍需品製造所去—到田間去！</p>
<p>㊃要救濟失學兒童—婦女們要在敵入的砲火下積極的進行，救濟失學兒童，凡戰區內逃出的靑年兒童，都要設法使他們有繼續求學的機會，對於一般的民衆方面，也應當廣汎的推行識字教育，並且要深入民間去，普遍的教育他們有關戰時的一切常識，以避免不必要而無抵抗的犧性，尤其重要的是在敎育中發動他們的救國熱情。</p>
<p>㊄募捐寒衣及慰勞品天氣一冷，無家可歸的難民，一定是無衣御寒，所以婦女們應做像女童軍一樣地工作起來，搬集寒衣分發收容所各難民，其次是慰勞品的徵集，慰勞前綫將士及傷兵。</p>
<p>㊅保育產婦及兒童—在難民收容所裏充滿了產婦及兒童，婦女們對於這一種的工作，也應該切實組織起來，從事看護產婦及保育兒童的工作，在可能範國內盡量設法使兒童撤退到安全地帶，以避免敵人的摧殘。這一點可以組織兒童戰時保育會，一方面保養地們，一方面敎育他們，因為兒童是我們民族的新生命，誰都應該負責保育的，婦女們担任此項工作是再適當也沒有的了。</p>
<p>㊆從事各馬路里弄的小組織—上海的抗戰，我們士氣的旺盛足使敵人望而膽寒，可是仍不免小有挫折，大半是為了有漢奸的作祟，因此消滅漢奸，這種工作是非常重要的，婦女們應該起來從事各馬路里弄的組織（辦法可參考抗戰第二期）茲為便利起見特分條略述如下：</p>
<p>甲·宣傳有關戰時的一般常識。</p>
<p>乙·維持該里弄的治安，如防止漢奸的活動及指導避雞防毒防空等。</p>
<p>丙·講述當天戰事新聞。</p>
<p>丁，提倡節衣縮食，盡量儲蓄，貢獻國家，並作獻金運動的實傳，勸弄里婦女們將金銀飾物及用具等，貢獻國家或調換公債。</p>
<p>戊，舉辦里弄消費或生產合作社。</p>
<p>己，集團作慰勞傷兵，救濟難民等工作。</p>
<p>庚，舉辦里弄幼稚園或小學，以救濟戰區內逃出的失學兒童。</p>
<p>辛，其地的宣傳工作如話劇播音，歌詠，演讲，發報，擘報等。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我們希望全國的女同胞，一致起來，建築成一個健全的婦女救亡陣綫，來發動以上各种的杭戰工作，來共同担負起救亡图存的使命。</p>

<h3>Enemy Forces Divide and Advance, Attempting to Seize Dachang; Our Fierce Counterattack Leaves the Enemy Unsupported</h3>
<p>On the Highway Line, We Still Hold Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai – The Fiercest Fighting Occurs Near Huanggang, Where the Enemy's Position Wavered – Fierce Battle North of Miaohang, Our Troops Pressing Towards Yanjiawan</p>
<p>(Report from the front lines received by this newspaper at 3:00 AM this morning) After being repelled by our forces, the enemy troops that advanced south along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway west of the Yunzaobang River from Huangjiazhai consolidated their positions around Huangjiazhai to Changjilouxia. They did not dare to advance before 4:00 PM yesterday. However, after 4:00 PM, the enemy reinforced their troops and completed their supplies, then launched two offensives. One route proceeded east from the line of Tanjiawanzhai and Changjilouxia, fiercely attacking our Gao Renqiaozhai. The other route proceeded south from Huangjiazhai west of the highway, fiercely attacking our Chenjiazhai and Yujiazhai. Our troops immediately engaged in a counterattack, fighting fiercely until around 8:00 PM, when the enemy, suffering heavy casualties, collapsed in disarray. Our troops still held the Chenjiazhai to Changjilouxia positions, awaiting an opportunity to advance. The enemy troops on the Gejiapailouzhai to Huanggang line west of the highway were surrounded on three sides (southeast and west) by our forces. They were exhausted and unable to advance. Therefore, at 8:00 PM, our troops, equipped with light and heavy weapons, launched a simultaneous counterattack on all three sides. Our artillery used dense fire to bombard the enemy positions. At the same time, our air force was also ordered to assist in the battle. An unprecedented fierce battle ensued. Our soldiers advanced fearlessly, fighting valiantly. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls, and the sound of artillery boomed incessantly. After 10:00 PM, the battle became even more intense. The enemy's position in the Huanggang area showed signs of wavering and appeared to be in dire straits. Although they continued to bombard our troops with artillery fire in an attempt to suppress our advance, they ultimately failed to diminish our soldiers' courage. It is expected that the stubborn enemy in that area will be defeated without difficulty. From the Zhangjiapailou to Dingjiaqiaozhai and Chenjiaxiang line, our fortifications are extremely strong, and our troop strength is very formidable. Although the enemy continuously launched separate attacks from the south of the Yunzaobang River, hoping to disperse our forces, they were repeatedly repelled by our troops with heavy losses. In addition, on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River east of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, except for areas along the river such as Tanjiawan, Yanjiawan, and Beiyangzhai, which were infiltrated by the enemy, the rest of the line, up to Sunzhai northeast of Miaohang, was firmly held by our troops. According to our military officers, north of Dachang and south of the Yunzaobang River, from Sunzhai in the far east to Chenjiaxiang north of the river in the west, the fortifications on both flanks are solid, and the strength is formidable. It is nothing but a daydream for the enemy to attempt a central breakthrough and seize Dachang.</p>
<p>The main battle between the two armies had not yet ended as of last night. The enemy is concentrating the elite of Shanghai and Songhu in an attempt to make a final stand. Our side is well aware of the enemy's conspiracy and, in order to protect Jiangwan and Zhabei, must firmly hold the south bank of the Yunzaobang River. Therefore, both sides are fighting fiercely on the one hand and deploying troops and generals on the other, brewing for a future major battle. ① Around 2:00 PM yesterday, the enemy used more than 30 tanks and more than 10 aircraft to cover 6,000 infantry soldiers, who then advanced across the Fengcun Tang River. In the evening, they pushed our troops back to Gejiapailou. At 6:00 PM, our reserve forces stationed there waited for the enemy to approach and immediately formed a network of fire, launching a full-scale counterattack. By about 8:00 PM, our troops had a significant advantage, and the enemy retreated to Bashiqiaozhai. Around 10:00 PM, our troops launched a coordinated attack from Yujiazhai, Chenjiazhai, Zhaojiajiao, and Qiangmentou, simultaneously on the left, right, and front. The enemy's momentum faltered, and by midnight, they had retreated north of the Fengcun Tang River. The enemy suffered more than 500 casualties, and we destroyed two tanks. The enemy abandoned weapons, which our forces are currently collecting. ② The enemy at Yanjiawan, after lying dormant for many days, suddenly became active again at 6:30 PM last night. First, the two sides engaged in artillery battles for about two hours. Then, the enemy launched an attack with 3,000 soldiers. Our troops engaged in fierce battles along the Zhayang Road near Ziyangbang. Our troops were very strong and had already pushed the enemy close to Yanjiawan. ③ Yesterday, our troops at Dunjuesi repeatedly engaged in small-scale operations, advancing towards the enemy along Qiaotingzhai and Xiaoguangzhai. The enemy used three or four small tanks at each location to block our advance. After 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, the artillery battles between the two sides were very intense.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Launch Four-Pronged Assault South of Yunzaobang River, Failing to Achieve Success</h3>
<p>Stalemate Near Huanggang Lasts Over Thirty Hours, Enemy's Intentions to Expand Eastward Quite Evident</p>
<p>Although the enemy troops have made some progress on the south bank of the Yunzaobang River, they are encountering strong resistance everywhere. The slow pace of their advance and the heavy casualties are beyond the enemy's initial expectations. At the moment, the enemy has been blocked at Huanggang and Yujiazhai. Starting yesterday morning, enemy aircraft also carried out extensive activities, dropping hundreds of bombs on both sides of the highway south of the Yunzaobang River. According to reports from the Central News Agency's correspondents embedded with the troops at 8:30 PM, they were still circling overhead. The enemy's artillery was also firing intensely. Within an area of about four kilometers, artillery fire filled the air, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. The tragic scene is indescribable in words. Under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, the enemy continued to attack our flank positions. However, our loyal and brave soldiers fought bloody battles, holding their original positions without retreating. The situation in each location and the battle reports received by this newspaper from the previous evening and yesterday morning are recorded below.</p>
<p>Four-Pronged Assaults All Fail</p>
<p>There were four fierce battles in the area yesterday. The most intense was near Huanggang, where the enemy and our forces have been locked in a stalemate for more than 30 hours. However, our troops have consistently held the line from Hulizhai to Shengjiazhai, strictly preventing the enemy's westward advance. At Chenjiazhai, next to the Liuhang-Dachang Highway, the enemy launched a fierce attack at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 20th). After our troops' desperate resistance, there was no change in the position until the evening. In the other two locations, on the banks of the river, the enemy launched an offensive westwards along Chenjiaxiang, Dingjiaqiaozhai, Zhangjialou, and Taoyuanbang, launching two successive assaults, which were both repelled by our troops. Another route, from Tanjiawanzhai and Huayuanzhai, attacked our Luzhai and Gao Renqiaozhai, but also failed.</p>
<p>Situation of the Bloody Battles from the Previous Evening to Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>In the battles north of Dachang, from the previous evening to 10:00 AM yesterday, the focus was still on the Yujiazhai area of Shanghai-Taicang Highway, especially the area from Gejiapailouzhai to Sujiazhai west of the highway. The enemy's goal was to use tanks to directly attack the front of Dachang along the highway and to use their main force to attack Xiaochiyuan and Sujiazhai in an attempt to break through the highway between Dachang and Nanxiang and put pressure on the rear of our forces. Therefore, after the enemy broke into Gejiapailouzhai, they gathered a large number of strong and stubborn infantry, and under the dense fire of their artillery, they launched a fierce assault on our Sujiazhai and Xiaochiyuan positions from Huanggang, using a wedge-shaped formation to aggressively attack. Our troops, realizing that this route was crucial to the success or failure of Dachang, deployed elite units, divided them into left and right flanks to encircle the enemy, and launched a joint assault with the front of Sujiazhai. An unprecedented bloody battle ensued. Until 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy launched four assaults. Our troops fought on three sides, fighting bravely and relentlessly, advancing without retreat. Therefore, the enemy's repeated assaults were met with heavy blows, and they retreated after suffering more than half of their casualties. Our side also suffered considerable losses. The enemy finally retreated to the Huanggang area after suffering heavy casualties at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, where they were surrounded by our forces on three sides. Because our forces are bound to counterattack on that line and have stationed heavy troops, the enemy rushed to build fortifications near Gejiapailouzhai. The enemy in the Huangjiazhai area along the front of the highway yesterday used 30 tanks to attack our Sujialinzhai and Yujiazhai positions in the southeast, covering a large number of enemy troops, and many enemy aircraft dropped bombs. At that time, our rear support troops were unable to catch up due to the enemy's intense firepower, and a portion of our positions was broken through. After dusk, our troops began to counterattack in different directions, fighting bloody battles all night. Three of the enemy's tanks were destroyed by our mortars, and they collapsed and retreated north of Huangjiazhai before dawn yesterday. From dawn to 10:00 AM, the enemy did not dare to attack. Our troops are still firmly defending the front lines north of Yujiazhai and Chenjiazhai along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. Chenjiaxiang is still in the hands of our troops. The previously breached positions have also been repaired. During the day, our troops recaptured a portion of the positions north of that area, between Dunjuesi and Caijiatang.</p>
<p>Enemy's Intentions to Expand Eastward</p>
<p>The enemy's positions south of the Yunzaobang River form a wedge shape, with the base extending 4,500 meters from Qiangmentouzhai west of the highway to Zhangyuzhai east of the highway, and extending approximately 2,000 meters south from Heida Huangzhai, with Huanggang as the apex. On the highway line, they have advanced about 1,500 meters south, gathering a force of over one division. They are currently increasing their forces steadily. The main force in the Liuhang area has moved to the south of the Yunzaobang River. Yesterday, over a thousand enemy troops gathered in the forests near Changjilouxia, close to our Gao Renqiaozhai east of the highway. A regiment has reinforced Zhangyuzhai, east of the highway, along the river. Although there has been no action as of yesterday evening, the enemy's intentions to expand eastwards from the highway are very evident.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle North of Miaohang</h3>
<p>Our Troops Approach Yanjiawan</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops in Jiangwan reported at 0:30 AM on the 21st that a fierce battle broke out again at 6:30 PM last night on the front lines of Miaohang, which had been silent for three days. Approximately 4,000 enemy troops attacked from Yanjiawan along the banks of the Yunzaobang River. The enemy's artillery shattered the silence, signaling the start of the fierce battle. Our forces also returned fire with artillery, and the two sides exchanged fire for about two hours. Our main force advanced along the Zhayang Road amidst the artillery fire, and a bloody battle began near Ziyangbang. Our troops launched repeated assaults, and after several hand-to-hand combats, had approached Yanjiawan and continued to advance. At the time of the report, the fierce battle was still in progress.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Advance at Shixianggong Temple</h3>
<p>Advancing 800 Meters from Zhujiazhai</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops in Guangfu reported at 12:50 PM on the 20th that the enemy intermittently shelled the area around Shixianggong Temple from the afternoon yesterday. At 7:00 PM, a fierce battle broke out at the intersection of Yangjing, Lianqi, and the Tang River. Two enemy tanks covered a regiment of troops in an attack on our Zhujiazhai-Beizhouzhai line. Although the enemy launched a fierce assault, they were repelled by our troops. A stalemate lasted for more than eight hours, with four or five attacks and retreats. Approximately 200 enemy soldiers were killed. By 7:00 AM this morning (the 20th), our troops were pursuing step by step, advancing 800 meters to the southeast and reaching the area between Wujiazhai and Duzhai. The momentum is strong, and the pursuit is still continuing.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Encircle and Attack the Enemy at Jiangwan</h3>
<p>The Enemy Retreats Towards Qimei Road</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops reported at 0:30 AM on the 21st that our troops' encirclement and attack on the enemy at Sijingchang yesterday was very successful. Therefore, at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, we launched an assault on the southeast of Fudan University from the Tiyuhuilu-Jingtoulu area in a large encirclement formation. At 9:00 PM, the vanguard made contact and a fierce battle broke out. After our brave charge, 60 to 70 enemy soldiers were killed. The enemy struggled to hold on for two hours, but did not dare to linger and retreated towards Qimei Road. The other areas were very quiet. Only small skirmishes were heard from the vicinity of Chih Chee University and Guangdong Street. The sharp sounds of gunfire occasionally punctuated the distant rumbling of artillery fire, like ornaments.</p>
<h3>One Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Guangfu</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, an enemy aircraft was hit by our anti-aircraft fire and damaged. It landed in the southwestern part of Guangfu Town, within our troops' positions. The aircraft's components are intact, but the pilot has fled. Our forces are currently searching for and arresting the pilot.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent embedded with the troops in Guangfu reported at 11:30 AM on the 20th that the enemy launched an attack on us from Lao Xuzhai and Zhao Zhai near Guangfu at dawn today. Our troops calmly resisted the attack, without charging out. Then, the artillery concentrated their fire and launched over fifty shells, which hit the targets accurately, killing many enemy soldiers. The enemy, realizing they could not succeed, also retreated.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Destroys Another Enemy Ammunition Depot</h3>
<p>Numbers 631 to 636, Lane 449, Dinghai Road, Yangshupu, are the site of the Japanese-owned Yufeng Cotton Mill. Recently, the enemy military has been forced to move a large portion of the military supplies and newly arrived ammunition to the workshops of the Yufeng Cotton Mill. Additionally, a large troop of enemy soldiers were hiding inside the buildings. Our forces detected this and reported it. Last night, when our air force flew to Shanghai to assist in the battle, they dropped bombs on the location, all of which hit their targets. Six workshops were destroyed by our bombing. The sound of the explosions shook the surrounding area, and a fire broke out. The enemy suffered heavy losses and many casualties. Details to follow.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that enemy warships in the Huangpu River conducted three disturbances last night at 11:00 PM, this morning at 0:30 AM, and again at 1:30 AM. Their anti-aircraft fire seemed sparse and weak, and their searchlights only made two or three sweeps, searching the sky. At that time, our planes were passing over western Shanghai, but did not fly to the Huangpu River and Yangshupu to drop bombs.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Open Fire on Pudong Again</h3>
<p>Enemy Vessel Attempts to Steal Coal, Repelled by Our Forces</p>
<p>An enemy warship anchored at buoy number nine suddenly opened fire on our Pudong area around 8:00 AM this morning (the 20th), bombarding it fiercely. At the same time, three other enemy vessels slowly approached the Pudong New Mitsui Wharf, attempting to land and steal fuel from the coal depot there. Our defending troops detected their scheme and ignored the enemy warship's shelling, waiting quietly for the enemy vessels to approach the shore. Then, they unleashed a dense barrage of machine gun fire. The enemy, seeing that we were prepared, fled in panic, but not before more than ten of them were killed or wounded by our fire.</p>
<h3>Aerial Patrols Guard Against Our Night Raids</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Patrol the Skies Over Eastern Shanghai at Night</p>
<p>After our air force launched occasional night raids on Shanghai, the enemy's base of operations in eastern Shanghai suffered significant losses. Therefore, starting the night before last, the enemy has been dispatching two squadrons of six aircraft each night to fly back and forth over eastern Shanghai, as a precaution to guard against our night raids.</p>
<h3>6,000 More Enemy Reinforcements Arrive</h3>
<p>Three More Divisions Will Continue to Reinforce Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to divert international attention and restore national prestige, the Japanese side plans to seize the non-garrison areas within the Shanghai Armistice Agreement area before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 30th of this month. Therefore, they have additionally mobilized troops of three or more divisions, totaling approximately 50,000, from the Ministry of the Army to Shanghai to participate in the war. It is rumored that this batch of reinforcements will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday, a total of seven enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Wusong Town Ferry Wharf. Three were fully loaded with war horses and military equipment, and four were fully loaded with approximately 5,000 enemy soldiers. They were immediately unloaded and disembarked, and then transported to the front in batches by approximately fifty enemy military trucks. According to investigations, the enemy troops that arrived were the second batch of the sixth reinforcement army. Furthermore, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, another enemy transport ship, No. 331, the "Wakasa Maru," arrived with a large batch of bombs (wrapped in straw bags) and unloaded them at the Osaka Wharf.</p>
<h3>Another Enemy Aircraft Carrier Arrives</h3>
<p>Temporary Airfield Being Built in Baotaishan</p>
<p>Confirmed reports state that, in addition to the many cruisers and gunboats, there was originally only one enemy aircraft carrier stationed at the Wusongkou Sanxia waters. On the morning of the 18th of this month, another enemy aircraft carrier arrived. Therefore, the number of enemy aircraft carriers currently anchored at Wusong has increased to two. In addition, the enemy has built a temporary airfield near Baotaishan in Wusong. According to someone from Wusong who came to Shanghai yesterday, they witnessed over twenty enemy aircraft parked near the Wusong Fisheries School, and three other enemy aircraft taking off from there.</p>
<h3>Enemy Repeatedly Accuses Us of Using Poison Gas, With No Factual Basis</h3>
<p>Spokesperson for the Ministry of Military Affairs Issues Solemn Statement: We Will Never Use Illegal Means in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Recently, the enemy has repeatedly claimed in Shanghai that our troops are using poison gas. On the evening of the 18th of this month, they issued a public statement to foreign journalists, making the same false and fabricated allegations. According to the spokesperson for our Ministry of Military Affairs, the enemy's despicable trick has long been spurned by knowledgeable people around the world. When the enemy claimed last week that they had obtained our poison gas bombs and their mechanisms, foreign journalists immediately asked if neutral technicians had been allowed to be present during the chemical experiments. The enemy was unable to answer. That same day, when the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was questioned by a Reuters reporter, he also admitted that there were no facts sufficient to prove that Japanese troops had been subjected to poison gas. This shows that the enemy's arbitrary propaganda has no basis in fact. The repeated dissemination of this information is a prelude to the renewed use of poison gas against us. We hereby solemnly declare that our troops will never use illegal means in the war of resistance. If the enemy claims again that their officers and soldiers have been subjected to poison gas, we will ask them, as we have done, to have a formal doctor from a third country provide proof. Otherwise, any further slanderous rumors published by the enemy will be considered completely fabricated and require no further explanation. (Central News Agency report, 20th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombarded Everywhere Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhabei, Pudong, Southwestern Shanghai, and the Old City - Many Homes Destroyed and Set Ablaze</p>
<p>Yesterday, enemy aircraft continued to fly over Zhabei, Pudong, Zhenru, Dachang, and other places, bombing all day long. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>Starting at 10:00 AM yesterday, three enemy bombers flew over Xinmin Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, dropping three bombs in the Xinmin Road area, destroying over twenty homes. They then flew over the Chang'an Road and Nanchang Road area, dropping nine bombs, and dropping seven or eight incendiary bombs in the Wuzhen Road and Guangfu Road area. The bombs ignited fires, and the burning was quite intense. At 11:30 AM, the aircraft flew east again, dropping two bombs near the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road. Homes in that area were hit by the bombs and caught fire, and the burning was also intense. Starting at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, three more enemy aircraft flew over the areas of Menggu Road, Datong Road, and the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, continuing to bomb. Three locations were bombed and caught fire. Then, the enemy aircraft flew over the North Railway Station, dropping two incendiary bombs on the office building of the Two-Roads Management Bureau. Because the building was constructed of reinforced concrete, only the top floor caught fire and burned for about several tens of minutes. The rest of the building suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Dachang</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday, several enemy aircraft continuously bombarded Baziqiao, Dachang, Zhenru, and the surrounding areas all day long, dropping no fewer than one hundred bombs in total, with the most being dropped on Dachang. However, because the enemy aircraft's targeting was inaccurate, except for dozens of bombs that hit our homes and were destroyed, the rest fell in the open fields, causing no loss to our military.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>In Pudong, four enemy aircraft flew low over Zhangjiabang at 8:00 AM yesterday, strafing the area with machine guns several times. At around 11:00 AM, three more enemy heavy bombers circled several times over Pudong, dropping six bombs near Yangjiadu. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, three more enemy aircraft dropped bombs in the Datangqiao area. Starting at 4:30 PM, another enemy aircraft circled over Laninidu, dropping another six or seven bombs, destroying over ten homes, and finally left in the evening.</p>
<p>Western Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition, in the Hongqiao Town of Western Shanghai, enemy aircraft dropped six bombs at noon yesterday, injuring over ten people. Enemy aircraft also flew to the Old City of Shanghai yesterday morning, but did not drop any bombs.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Memorial Day, U.S. Ships Hold Commemoration</h3>
<p>The 27th of this month is U.S. Navy Memorial Day. The U.S. ships anchored in the Huangpu River will hold a commemorative ceremony in Shanghai at that time.</p>
<h3>Enemy Movements</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Military Supplies Stored in Hongkou; Kawashima Yoshiko Arrives in Shanghai to Engage in Activities</p>
<p>▲ According to confirmed reports, Hongkou Zhabu Road Honganji Temple (Japanese Buddhist temple) is one of the enemy's important military installations. An underground tunnel has been excavated under the main hall of the temple, storing large quantities of military supplies. Three hundred artillerymen are stationed there, with two heavy artillery emplacements and two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns on the roof. In addition, the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Seward Road also has artillery emplacements.</p>
<p>▲ In the Pingliang Road area of Eastern Shanghai, from Huaxing Road to the end of Pingliang Road, the enemy has planted many landmines at the intersections of the various small roads bordering the Chinese concessions.</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Women's Elementary School on Hongkou Shigaota Road has been used by the enemy as the headquarters of the Hongkou District since the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>▲ Recently, the enemy has transported a large number of bamboo ladders and wooden rafts made of wooden boards, which are stacked at the Jun Gong Road and the waterfront of the golf course for landing purposes.</p>
<p>▲ Enemy Navy Commander Hasegawa convened a meeting at the Japanese Club on Hongkou Bong Road on the morning of the 17th, attended by approximately twenty people, including Harada, Okawa, Uchi-o, Tamatsu Naga, and military commanders. The topics discussed included: ① the location of troop concentration for this campaign; ② the defense against our air raids; and ③ plans to actively occupy Dachang.</p>
<p>▲ Shimizu, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, left Shanghai and returned to Japan on the 13th of this month. Before his departure, he contacted the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France before proceeding. It is believed that Shimizu's mission in returning to Japan is mainly to establish a neutral zone in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday morning around 7:30 AM, Kawashima Mamu, accompanied by Counselor Shimizu, traveled from his residence on Judong Road by car to Hongkou to meet with enemy military commanders Hasegawa, Matsui, Masaki, and others to listen to reports on the front lines and discuss diplomatic issues. He did not return to his residence in the French Concession via the Garden Bridge until 8:50 AM.</p>
<p>▲ The enemy Kwantung Army recently dispatched international spy Kawashima Yoshiko and several Chinese and Japanese women to Shanghai to engage in activities. It is now known that they have established an intelligence agency in a certain location to probe Soviet intelligence. The person in charge is Vonsiatsky, an important member of the White Russian Fascist movement, who has several White Russians working under him in Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ The enemy has been actively counterattacking in recent days, attempting to occupy the area that they once occupied on January 28th within this month. However, they have been met with heavy resistance from our troops, and their casualties have been unprecedented. The eleven military hospitals in the Shanghai East District are all full, and as a last resort, they have been forced to bring in Red Cross ships to transport the wounded back to their home country for treatment. At around 2:00 PM this afternoon, another merchant ship-turned-Red Cross ship, the "Asu Maru," arrived, loading approximately sixty wounded enemy generals and soldiers for transport back to Japan.</p>
<p>▲ The enemy flagship "Izumo" suddenly sailed to Wusong at 9:10 AM yesterday morning and sailed back at 6:25 PM, still anchored at buoy number two across from the Gonghexing Wharf.</p>
<h3>China's Path to Democracy</h3>
<p>— Song Qingling</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:13 AM, Madam Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling, delivered a broadcast speech at the American-owned R.C.A. radio station in Shanghai. The speech, entitled "China's Path to Democracy," was broadcast to various locations in the United States. It is said that tens of millions of radio listeners in the United States were able to directly receive this broadcast. The text of the speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>I am truly delighted to have this opportunity to speak to the American people about the pressing issues in the hearts of us Chinese.</p>
<p>I spent my youth in the United States and was imbued with the great democratic traditions of America, which has become one of the great forces in my life. Its culture has become a part of the education I received. This is very precious for my motherland, which desperately needs the spirit of democracy. Therefore, when I speak to the country where I resided in my youth, I do not feel like I am contacting you as a stranger. Instead, I know that my appeal will surely be understood and responded to by you, just as America has always generously shown in its attitude towards China.</p>
<p>China has launched a war of resistance against an inhuman aggressor that cannot be described in words. The Japanese militarists, who dream of realizing the fascist dream of aggression, are inflicting death and destruction on our land. Who can not be shocked by the news of the terrible suffering encountered by the Chinese people? Who can not vow to wipe out these heinous criminals after witnessing the barbaric act of ruthlessly bombing innocent women and children? It is clear that the massacre of non-combatants in our cities is not necessary for military targets. Then, can one maintain a passive attitude towards this public enemy, which not only threatens China but also threatens the civilization of the whole world? The so-called enlightened Prime Minister of Japan, Fumimaro Konoe, even said, "Japan's only way is to lash China, to make it kneel, to make it no longer have the spirit of fighting." These cruel words further unleashed the bloodthirsty Japanese military.</p>
<p>Other Japanese diplomats are more cunning and less frank. They sophistically argue that all they ask is that China should fully understand their proposed "cooperation" proposal. In return for their kindness, China only needs to reshape our history according to their wishes. Anti-Japanese sentiment should be completely eliminated from our lives and textbooks. Their barbaric behavior should be interpreted by us as sacred deeds of obeying fate. I can only let the people of the world think about how absurd this is. Even in Japan, this defensive propaganda contains a threat to the United States itself. At the same time, any country that feels that the Chinese people are suffering endless pain from Japan's atrocities should also consider it a threat. The almost unanimous agitation of British, American, and other people shows the universal condemnation of these barbaric humans by the whole world. The spontaneous anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States cannot but attract the solemn attention of the Japanese militarists, resenting your lack of cooperation. Although the current threat from Japan is only applied to China, who can guarantee that at some point, such a strange attitude will not harm its own people in action?</p>
<p>For decades, Japanese imperialism has been constantly invading China and seizing our land. Not to mention the distant past, in the recent six years, the aggression of Japanese imperialism has now developed into an attack on North China and Shanghai, and has reached the final moment of China's life and death. The whole world can still remember the occupation of the three northeastern provinces, the Shanghai War of 1932, and the means by which Japanese imperialism gradually entered Jehol, Chahar, and northern Hebei through conspiracies and massacres. The United States called on the world's powers to hold the Washington Conference to make Japan accept the treaty respecting China's territorial and administrative integrity and the open-door policy. However, the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty shrinkingly sat and watched these treaties being torn up by Japan, one of the signatory countries, and did not try to stop the crazy adventure of the Japanese militarists to conquer China. The Tanaka Memorial, which is regarded as the bible by every Japanese militarist, is the established plan of Japan to conquer all of Asia, which is placed before all treaties. Do we still need to remind the people of the world of this point?</p>
<p>Why is China poor and weak, and why is Japan able to run rampant in Chinese territory? This question is difficult to explain clearly in a few words. To put it briefly, China's weakness and powerlessness in the past ten years has been due to internal friction and mutual slaughter. From 1923 to 1927, under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great national revolutionary movement that spread throughout the country united the country and became the beginning of a great united nation. The old warlords were overthrown one by one. Under the instructions of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, China had embarked on the road to completing a strong and democratic country. However, the death of Mr. Sun caused great misfortune to the Chinese nation. His legacy and the Three Principles of the People disappeared in the years of civil war. The result of mutual slaughter was the destruction of the country, and the lives of the masses of people fell into poverty. Therefore, Japan was able to seize our four northeastern provinces and continue to invade our land. Our internal division only allowed Japan to reap the benefits.</p>
<p>In mid-July, Japan continued to send large armies to North China. It also attempted to seize another large piece of our territory, while targeting the Yangtze River basin as its second goal, stationing a large number of troops in Shanghai, attempting to occupy Shanghai and its surrounding areas in order to promote further aggression. But it failed. The Chinese people, with their brave determination and flesh and blood, resisted the aggressor's giant ships, cannons, airplanes, and mechanized troops. The enemy's bombing destroyed our cities, schools, libraries, and other cultural institutions. The enemy arbitrarily massacred our women and children, making every Chinese commoner feel the madness and irrationality of Japan. No matter how crazy the Japanese militarists are, no matter how powerful the Japanese militarists are, I dare to tell you firmly on behalf of all the Chinese people that the Japanese militarists will surely meet their demise on our territory. All Chinese people are prepared to defend their motherland with the ultimate sacrifice. The indignation of all our people is more than enough to compensate for the difference in military equipment.</p>
<p>In the past three weeks, the power of the anti-Japanese movement has greatly increased. In recent years, our workers, farmers, and intellectuals have joined together in salvation groups to organize a national war of resistance. At the same time, national consciousness has also materialized along with this movement. We have realized that the great Chinese nation is an indivisible whole, enough to shatter any conspiracy of Japan. When the Japanese army attacked us and enemy planes indiscriminately bombed our innocent civilians, all parties, factions, and groups in the country forgot all past disputes and united to form a strong front to launch a sacred national liberation war. The civil war had long ended. All internal friction had been eliminated. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and General Zhu De, who were at odds with each other, also reconciled in Nanjing. This new offensive of Japanese imperialism has become a catalyst for combining all the resources and forces of China to resist the violent enemy. The former Red Army, now the Eighth Route Army, is a part of the national army and is joining the war. It won an overwhelming victory in its first contact with the enemy. Our national unity has generated great power, as strong as a fortress, giving the invaders a head-on blow.</p>
<p>If necessary, we will naturally resist the fascist aggressors of Japan with our own strength. But we have heard the voices of sympathy from all over the world. Therefore, we are fortunate that we are not isolated during our suffering. The condemnation of the Japanese executioners' atrocities by the whole world has given much comfort to our suffering compatriots. I firmly believe that the United States will express sincere sympathy for our country's struggle for freedom and independence. We know that we are not fighting alone. We know that we are launching a war against these fascist thugs not only for ourselves, but also for all those who still love freedom and democracy. You hate these fascist demons and spontaneously want to boycott all Japanese goods. This is what we urgently need. Please do not let any ship leave the United States for Japan, because Japan can transform any of your products to deal with us. Monetary assistance is certainly important for our war, but more importantly, please continuously transport military arms and ammunition to replenish our army. We must have a strong army to resist a strong enemy. I hope that the voice and efforts of the fair American public opinion will reach the whole world. The United States does not need to participate in the war to destroy this fascist threat in the Far East. President Roosevelt's moving speech succinctly stated that the whole world morally condemns the atrocities of this international rogue. Please unanimously support President Roosevelt's speech, so that his words can be put into action, and extinguish the cruel flames before they spread to all countries in the world. I ask the American people to rise up and lead this holy crusade. I firmly believe that you will not disappoint us.</p>

<h3>Enemy Retreats North on the Jinpu Line</h3>
<p>Fierce battle between our forces and the enemy south of Pingyuan; enemy routed between Shijiazhuang and Baoding; our right flank in northern Shanxi under heavy enemy attack</p>
<p>[Beijing] According to news from foreign sources in Jinan today, the Japanese army is currently retreating from northern Shandong. Han Fuju's troops have advanced rapidly towards Dezhou from the Tuhai River, with little resistance from the Japanese army. Foreign sources indicate that this development is due to political reasons. Other sources say it is due to the active guerrilla forces in Hebei province, so the Japanese army has to shorten its communication lines in the Jinpu Railway area. At the same time, the Japanese army that entered northern Henan has temporarily stopped advancing and is waiting for reinforcements to attack the Chinese army's positions north of Zhangde. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Military News: 1. Our guerrilla forces have now seized Dongguang; 2. More than 1,000 enemies entrenched in Pingyuan and Lijizhai, ten miles south of Pingyuan, are under siege and fierce attack by our army; 3. A squadron of our aircraft bombed Lijizhai and Pingyuan this afternoon at 3:00 PM, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy; 4. Our aircraft safely passed over Jinan and returned to defense at 4:00 PM. The public saw our aircraft for the first time and were extremely excited. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Today, the enemy in Pingyuan attacked south and engaged in fierce fighting with our army on the north bank of the Tuhai River. The fighting stopped at 8:00 PM. Today, four enemy planes dropped eight bombs on Yanzhou, damaging one arch of the Sihe stone bridge. They bombed one shed car in Sunshidian. Five more planes reconnoitered Yucheng and Yancheng, and one plane reconnoitered Sangzidian. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The capital has just received a telegram from the Shandong provincial authorities stating that after our army crossed the Tuhai River and launched an attack to the north, the enemy retreated in disarray. A certain division of our army on the Jinpu Railway front has now advanced to the area north of Luanzhuang and north and west of Jimingdian, and is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. Pingyuan will soon be recovered. On the right flank, a certain unit of our army has now advanced to the area north of Lingxian and Shanghe. A certain guerrilla unit has even recovered Ningjin in Hebei province. On the left flank, a certain guerrilla unit, in addition to recovering Gaotang, northwest of Yucheng, on the 18th, is also actively advancing. The Jinpu Railway defense line is now as solid as a rock, and the enemy will certainly not be able to cross the Lei Pond. (20th, Central News Agency) [Nanjing] A squadron of our air force, in order to assist the army in attacking on the Jinpu Railway line, flew to the Pingyuan area at 2:00 PM on the 20th to bomb the enemy's supplies and military engineering works. When our aircraft flew over Pingyuan Railway Station, a large number of enemy troops were concentrated at the station, and several armored vehicles were parked there. When the enemy troops saw our aircraft flying over, they fled in panic. Our aircraft calmly dropped dozens of bombs on the station and armored vehicles. The station immediately caught fire, and the armored vehicles exploded at the same time. Our air force completed its mission and returned to defense together. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Relevant sources: Our army captured Dezhou on the Jinpu Railway on the 20th. The enemy retreated north from Dezhou. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Kaifeng] The enemy between Shijiazhuang and Baoding has been routed. Small groups of plainclothes troops that have been harassing Handan and Cixian are being surrounded and eliminated by our forces. Therefore, the sound of artillery can be heard in Zhangde. Passenger trains are temporarily operating to Baoliansi. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Kaifeng] A regiment of the enemy that crossed the Zhang River was completely eliminated by our forces on the 20th, and an enemy armored vehicle was seized. (20th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the morning of the 19th, the enemy launched a fierce attack on a certain army on our right flank. The fighting was most intense from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Later, after our fresh troops joined the counterattack, they finally repelled the enemy, and we still firmly defended our original position. By the afternoon, the fighting gradually eased. In the central area, because the enemy and we were fighting for high ground, both sides suffered heavy casualties. On the left flank, the enemy released smoke bombs, seemingly transferring troops from the rear to other places. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the afternoon of the 19th, the enemy in Yongxing Village (about thirty miles northwest of Xinkou) sent more than forty people to reconnoiter and guard Zhaowuzhuang. More than ten people were wounded by our forces. At 1:00 PM, the enemy reinforced more than 200 people to retrieve their wounded soldiers and launched an attack on our guard position. They were repelled by our forces. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the evening of the 16th, a certain detachment of our army divided its forces to attack Hanjiafang Village, Chenjiabao, Daiyue Town, and Yulin Village in Huairen. They immediately blew up the iron bridge in Chenjiabao. Now the traffic between Yanmen and Datong has been destroyed by us, and the enemy's transportation is difficult and the rear support has been cut off. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The enemy attacking Niangziguan from Jiuguan has always been surrounded by our forces. The enemy's two regiments have been annihilated by us for days, with about more than 2,000 casualties. Our army also suffered heavy casualties. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>24 Enemy Aircraft Destroyed in Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The news that our army raided the enemy's temporary air force base in Yangmingbao in northern Shanxi and destroyed 24 enemy aircraft has also been reported by relevant sources here and has been confirmed. (20th, Central News Agency) [Taiyuan] In order to eliminate the enemy's aircraft arbitrarily strafing our non-combatants, our army has made up its mind to destroy its aircraft warehouse in northern Shanxi. A certain regiment of Liu's division was sent to Yangmingbao enemy airport for reconnaissance (Yangmingbao is north of Guoxian and south of Daixian, and is a temporary base for the enemy's air force invading our Shanxi Province), hiding around and watching for opportunities for many days. At first, only a few enemy aircraft were found taking off and landing. Regiment Commander Chen Xishi and Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Naigui personally concealed themselves and watched again a few days ago. On the evening of the 18th, they saw a total of 24 enemy aircraft landing. Regiment Commander Chen saw that the opportunity had come and immediately began to deploy. One battalion was deployed to Guoxian, one battalion was deployed north of Yangmingbao and Daixian to block the enemy's reinforcements on both flanks, and one battalion was determined to die bravely. At 1:00 AM on the 20th, they broke into the airport. Hundreds of hand grenades were fired simultaneously, and the sound of explosions was endless. All 24 enemy aircraft were blown up and caught fire. The enemy's guards, about a battalion or so, moved out upon hearing the alarm and began a melee with our army in the dark night at the airport for more than an hour. The enemy's reinforcements from Yangmingbao also arrived, and more than ten armored vehicles escorted the battle. The battalion saw that the mission had been accomplished and began to leave safely. In this battle, our side suffered more than 100 casualties, and only more than 20 wounded soldiers were rescued. The rest all made heroic sacrifices. There was also one battalion commander, two company commanders, and five platoon leaders seriously injured. The enemy's casualties were several times more than ours. Also, a small artillery team of a certain brigade of our army shot down two enemy aircraft in the front on the afternoon of the 18th, both of which crashed near Lingshan. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Although enemy aircraft still came to disturb Pingxing on the 20th, only one or two aircraft came each time, without dropping bombs. This may be because our army destroyed 24 of its aircraft, and the enemy's transportation was also destroyed, so there was a shortage of aircraft and ammunition. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Enemy Deploys Puppet Troops for Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] People from the front said that the enemy is recently afraid of the divine power of our army's guerrilla warfare and wants to imitate it by disguising puppet troops as farmers, with towels or blue cloth wrapped around their heads, and appearing near our positions. Our army has noticed this situation and has stepped up its attention to prevention. However, their guerrilla warfare lacks training and has little effect. The enemy's army originally used puppet troops as the vanguard, but recently they have changed to deploying puppet troops for reconnaissance, disturbance, and other tasks, while their regular army acts as the vanguard. (20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Many Low-Ranking Enemy Officers are Tired of War</h3>
<p>[Taiyuan] In recent days, our army has won many victories and captured many low-ranking enemy officers and soldiers. Diaries and letters were found, in which the records and correspondence mostly expressed disgust for the war. A certain company commander wrote in his diary, "Heavy casualties have been suffered in continuous battles. I have witnessed several comrades being shattered by artillery fire. My conscience has discovered that the psychological aversion to war can no longer be supported," etc. This proves that the few Japanese militarists who launched the war of aggression against China are not only deeply hated by their people, but also that their low-ranking officers are also tired of war, and their collapse must not be far away.

<h3>Enemy Planes Attack Nanjing Twice</h3>
<p>Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bombed Again; Jiangxi Shoots Down Two Enemy Planes</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Nine enemy heavy bombers and five fighter planes advanced towards Nanjing along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway at 12:30 PM on the 20th. Our air force, upon receiving the report, immediately intercepted them. When the enemy planes reached the vicinity of Changzhou, they suddenly turned towards Jiangbei and detoured to attack Nanjing. Around 1:00 PM, nine enemy bombers were discovered in the suburbs of Nanjing. Our anti-aircraft guns and artillery fired fiercely at them. The enemy planes panicked and dropped more than twenty bombs near the airfield. Three of them flew high and sped across the sky above Nanjing. At that time, the city's anti-aircraft guns and artillery densely and simultaneously fired. The enemy planes hurriedly flew towards the northwest. It is reported that, apart from some office buildings inside the airfield being destroyed by the bombing, there were no other losses. At 2:30 PM, six enemy planes flew to the Danyang and Changzhou areas to drop bombs, then appeared to be advancing towards Nanjing. Our air force immediately flew to intercept them.

<p>[Nanjing] In the attack at 12:30 PM, there were a total of nine heavy bombers, escorted by four fighter planes. They dropped about twenty-four large bombs outside the South Gate. Because they were flying very high, the anti-aircraft guns were unable to hit them. The enemy planes did not bomb Pukou. Only three bombers flew towards the Wutai Mountain area. Due to the intense anti-aircraft fire, they dropped their bombs and immediately fled. At 3:40 PM, the alarm sounded again, indicating that four enemy planes were advancing towards Nanjing, but they did not reach Nanjing and instead dropped bombs in Danyang and Changzhou. Subsequently, several civilian ships were sunk in the river near Changzhou. Today, six enemy planes dropped large bombs outside the South Gate in succession. A Reuters reporter believed that the airfield and arsenal there must have suffered heavy damage. However, after the second all-clear signal, he went to inspect the two places and found that the arsenal was still busy with work as usual, and the airfield had fifty large craters, which were being quickly filled by workers. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] This afternoon, enemy planes attacked Nanjing again. There were at least six bombers and four fighter planes. At 12:40 PM, heavy bombers flew in from the east and bombed the airfield from an altitude of 10,000 feet, shaking the entire city. The anti-aircraft guns immediately fired fiercely. The enemy planes then flew north to attack Pukou. At the same time, three more bombers flew in from the west and bombed the airfield and arsenal outside the South Gate again. Four fighter planes flew in a circle from north to south to protect the bombers. After the enemy planes flew away from Nanjing, an explosion was heard from the southeast, probably near Banqiao. The all-clear signal was given at 1:30 PM. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th, via Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>U.S. to Take Strong Measures Besides Mediation at Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>U.S. President States No Prior Commitments with Other Countries; Davis Talks with Roosevelt at Length Before Leaving for Belgium; Originator of Kellogg-Briand Pact Condemns Japan for Abandoning Faith</p>
<p>[Washington] The State Department today, together with representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, jointly studied the Nine-Power Treaty and various diplomatic documents to determine what rights should be enjoyed by countries that declare their adherence to the treaty. They also indicated that they had considered steps that were more forceful than mediation regarding the Sino-Japanese War. It is said that while the conference can take any appropriate measures, it is unlikely that there will be any more severe actions other than the imposition of sanctions by the countries concerned. Diplomatic circles believe that based on the recent attitudes of countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, there still seems to be a tendency towards mediation and compromise. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>[New York] Davis, the chief U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, is scheduled to lead the delegation on the "Washington" liner to Belgium tomorrow. President Roosevelt recently made a statement on this matter to answer the opposition, stating, "Regarding Mr. Davis' trip, the U.S. government has not made any promises to other relevant countries." The New York Times also commented, saying, "Although President Roosevelt has made this statement, we still believe that the head of state must have a plan in mind to effectively punish 'international lawlessness.' This plan is not military in nature, and the United States will not be drawn into a vortex of war as a result. As for its content, President Roosevelt remains tight-lipped." (Havas dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>⊙Hyde Park, New York President Roosevelt met with Davis, the chief U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, for a long time today. Afterward, the President stated that before Mr. Davis' attendance at this conference, the U.S. government had absolutely no tacit understanding with any other government. The invitation to the conference stated that "countries will examine the situation in the Far East and study peaceful methods to shorten the scourge of war." (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙St. Paul, USA Kellogg, Secretary of State during President Coolidge's administration from 1925 to 1929, and the originator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, stated here today, "Japan's aggression against China is completely inconsistent with the spirit and text of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. I still believe that the hope for world peace depends entirely on signatory countries adhering to the principles of the treaty. Any country that violates the treaty is abandoning faith and creating international anarchy. Therefore, countries that respect international obligations should seriously consider steps to make the treaty effective." (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>[New York] After a long talk with Davis, the U.S. representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, President Roosevelt declared today that the U.S.' participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference does not bind it to any other government. This statement is seen as a response to Republican Senator Johnson, who gave a speech in San Francisco today, asking Davis not to depart for Belgium until the U.S. and Britain had previously agreed on some kind of plan. President Roosevelt also said that the purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is for all countries to find a way to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem by agreed methods. We aim to cooperate with other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, including China and Japan. The U.S. delegation is scheduled to depart for Belgium on the "Washington" on Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the German and Italian governments are currently in negotiations. Italy's acceptance of participation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is almost completely certain. Therefore, what Germany and Italy are discussing is not related to whether Italy will participate in the conference. It is mainly about what attitude the Italian representative should take.

<h3>Japan Can Only Be Self-Sufficient in Copper for Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Iron, Lead, Zinc, and Aluminum All Depend on Foreign Supply</p>
<p>[Washington] According to a report released today by the National Resources Committee, of the main raw materials needed by Japan for its war in China, only copper can be fully produced domestically. Other basic war materials such as iron, lead, zinc, and aluminum all need to be imported in large quantities. Based on a survey from 1932, Japan produced a total of 76,000 metric tons of copper, with consumption being only 75,000 metric tons. Other minerals: ⑴ Iron: Japan must import from various countries. Domestic iron production in Japan is only 1,200,000 metric tons, while consumption reaches 1,600,000 metric tons. Of the 400,000 metric tons of iron imported by Japan, about 300,000 metric tons come from China and about 100,000 metric tons from India. ⑵ Lead: Japan's dependence on foreign supply is even greater. Domestic lead production in Japan is only 4,000 metric tons, while consumption reaches 61,000 metric tons. The 57,000 metric tons imported is mostly supplied by the U.S. and Canada, followed by Australia and Mexico. ⑶ Zinc: Japan only produces 10,000 metric tons, while consumption reaches 50,000 metric tons. The shortfall is mostly supplied by Canada and Australia. ⑷ Aluminum: Japan consumes 8,000 metric tons, which is entirely supplied by Europe, Canada, and the U.S. Therefore, if various countries implement economic sanctions against Japan, it will definitely be effective.

<h3>U.S. Opposition Party Criticizes Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Landon and Johnson Give Speeches, Saying the President's Policies Are Quite Dangerous</p>
<p>⊙Topeka, USA Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in the last presidential election, gave a radio speech today, launching an extremely fierce attack on President Roosevelt's foreign and domestic policies. He said, "The Roosevelt of today is completely different from the Roosevelt of 1932 during the election. What is most concerning is that the power we have given him has reached a concerning level. For example, in foreign affairs, President Roosevelt's actions, if not cautious, risk drawing the U.S. into a vortex of war. In short, the President's impulsive, arbitrary, and dictatorial attitude will encounter a greater crisis internationally than domestically. For example, Congress has adopted a neutrality policy, but the President has rejected this principle of neutrality with his personal will. Under this situation, the U.S. Congress should decide whether it will completely rely on the President's whims or still adhere to its original policies." Landon then asked 170 million voters to unite to protect the Republic, because the President's actions today have violated the provisions and spirit of the Constitution, so he requested Congress to withdraw the broad powers it has given to the President, so that the President can be guided by experienced people. Landon pointed out that the President's plan to reorganize the Supreme Court was an attempt to expand his personal power, and he also believed that the various other bills proposed by the President were reckless and impractical, and did not help the actual situation, so there was no talk of recovery, and unemployment was still a problem. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Republican Senator Johnson issued a formal statement today, arguing that the U.S. should stay out of the Far Eastern crisis and avoid any entanglement with the League of Nations. Johnson asked Americans to pay attention to the various actions and propaganda that led the U.S. to participate in the last World War, so as to avoid repeating past mistakes. Japan's actions in China are undoubtedly outrageous, leading to sympathy for China and hatred for Japan, but this kind of emotion is enough to lead people into a vortex of war, which we should guard against. Finally, Johnson asked Americans not to forget the failure of Stimson's warning to Japan in 1918 and the cold shoulder he received from the British. He meant that if the U.S. does not take this failure as a lesson, it will repeat Stimson's mistakes. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

As a result, a great disturbance has occurred in the securities market, which is only seen after the great chaos of 1929. Speculators are dumping in large quantities, making brokers unable to cope. The market is full of shouts and noises. Business people calling to demand margin calls continue throughout the night. The sale of whole blocks of shares has reached from thousands to twenty-five thousand shares, and notices sent by telegram from all over the country are flying in like snowflakes. The total number of securities traded throughout the day has reached 7.29 million shares. Fortunately, large investment companies purchased in large quantities in the afternoon, which slightly stopped the collapse. As a result, prices rose to six points, and the number of drops also reached five points. According to news from Hyde Park, President Roosevelt is unwilling to discuss the sharp fall in New York securities, and is unwilling to exercise the President's prerogative to declare the securities market closed.

<p>[New York] In recent weeks, the stock market here has been very chaotic, and the prices of various securities have fallen significantly. After the market opened today, the decline was even sharper. Within an hour, the number of securities traded reached more than two million shares. However, by the time the market closed, the prices of various major securities had rebounded. The stocks of various railway companies, public utilities companies, and government bonds remained strong. In total, the number of shares traded throughout the day reached 7.5 million, which is the highest amount since 1933. Financial circles believe that the current general economic situation in the United States is still good, so they do not know the reason for the continued decline in the prices of various securities. Well-informed sources also do not believe that the continued decline in the prices of various securities in recent days is a harbinger of a future financial panic, as in 1929. The current government is closely watching the situation in the stock market, but the Federal Reserve Board does not seem likely to intervene for the time being. In addition, Representative Sabath, a Democrat from Chicago, recently sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, saying that the recent decline in the stock market was caused by speculation and manipulation by the banking industry, and requested the President to take immediate and severe measures to stop it, even if it means implementing currency inflation, so as not to follow the path of the 1929 financial panic.

<p>⊙Toronto The sharp fall in U.S. securities has now affected the Canadian market. According to the Toronto Star's editorial, there is no reason for this sharp fall. There is no reason in the trend of slow commerce to cause this change. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th, via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Non-Intervention Committee Meeting: The Spanish Issue Becomes Deadlocked Again</h3>
<p>Italian and Russian Representatives Reject French Proposal; British Government Decides to Make a Final Rescue Attempt</p>
<p>[London] This morning, London is making a final effort to salvage the breakdown of the Non-Intervention Committee. It is believed here that although the committee reached a deadlock last night, it is not entirely hopeless to avoid a breakdown at the meeting this afternoon. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources recently stated that the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteers from Spain will continue to be discussed within the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention Measures for a considerable period. When the committee continues its meeting this afternoon, the British and French governments may declare their acceptance of the Italian proposal, using the compromise proposal put forward by the United Kingdom on July 14 as the basis for discussion. However, there is one condition: the issue of withdrawing volunteers should be resolved as soon as possible. The reason for the concessions made by Britain and France to Italy is, firstly, to show sincerity, and secondly, to force Germany and Italy to adopt a definite stance. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon to continue discussing the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries. British Foreign Secretary Eden personally chaired the meeting and submitted the proposal made by the French representative at the last meeting for discussion. After three hours, there was still no hope of reaching a compromise. The subcommittee then decided to postpone the meeting until 3:30 p.m. tomorrow. However, it is generally believed that a better result may not be obtained at that time. At today's meeting, Italian representative Grandi spoke first, strongly stating that the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War must re-submit the compromise proposal put forward by the British government on July 15 for discussion, and said that the Italian government had submitted a reply to this proposal. When Grandi spoke, Chairman Eden repeatedly interjected, asking him to pay attention to the facts of the discussion and not to involve procedural issues, and said that the proposal put forward by the French representative was actually based on the British compromise proposal, and the two cases were actually two in one. French representative Corbin said that the French proposal was sent to the governments of the countries concerned on the 16th, and the representatives of the countries should be asked to express their opinions without involving other issues. Portuguese representative Monteiro then spoke, describing in detail the evolution of the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and said that the first to intervene in the Spanish Civil War was actually the Soviet Union, and that the current situation was becoming increasingly serious. The Nyon Agreement was actually detrimental to the Spanish National Army. The best solution now is for all countries to recognize the National Army government as a belligerent group. In conclusion, he said that if France could restore the land border surveillance measures, Portugal would also be prepared to do the same. Chairman Eden, considering that what the Portuguese representative said was inconsistent with the purpose of the meeting, replied that the subcommittee was meeting today to invite representatives from various countries to express their opinions on the French proposal. Please pay attention. At this point, representatives from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden successively expressed their acceptance of this proposal. However, German representative Wallmann still insisted on re-discussing the British compromise proposal first. Soviet representative Maisky then spoke, saying that although the Soviet government did not refuse to discuss French construction, "this proposal is actually equivalent to continuing to promote the so-called non-intervention policy. There is no guarantee of how to make it more effective, and it does not stipulate effective measures for monitoring violations of the non-intervention agreement. Therefore, if the French proposal is accepted, it will only cause the representatives of the countries on the Adjustment Committee to continue to talk endlessly in the future, while certain countries that supply the Spanish National Army with weapons and volunteers can still continue to do so. The Soviet government cannot be responsible for the consequences that this situation may cause." Maisky then stated that the Soviet Union has always supported the complete withdrawal of volunteers from various countries in Spain. It is proposed that foreign volunteers belonging to both sides of the Spanish Civil War should immediately withdraw in large numbers in proportion to the total amount. Two, implement surveillance measures, but only on the condition of restoring maritime surveillance measures. After Maisky's speech, the subcommittee adjourned for a moment. After resuming, Chairman Eden summarized the opinions of the representatives of various countries, stating that the Soviet Union advocated that the belligerent groups in the country should be recognized only after all volunteers from various countries within the Spanish borders have withdrawn. The Italian representative argued that the opinions of the groups advocating prior recognition of belligerent groups were extremely contradictory, which was already undeniable. However, if the subcommittee is declared to be adjourned indefinitely because of this, it would "not only be unfair, but also not help the situation. It is decided to continue the meeting tomorrow afternoon in order to strive to find a compromise." (Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Coming and Going in the Bombing</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Twelve</p>
<p>The capital on the 25th was particularly clear. Early in the morning, people were saying that enemy planes might attack today. Sure enough, around nine o'clock, just as I was about to take a car east to visit Mr. Wang, a housemate said that the air raid alarm had sounded. -- In my half-deaf ears, I really didn't hear anything.</p>
<p>Before long, there was another tense and urgent air raid alarm, so my housemates all ran to the trenches at the foot of the mountain to take refuge. They were all very concerned about me, calling me to sit in the deepest part. The trench was dug into the mountain, and there were no air vents except for the entrance. Sitting in the trench for a while, my feet felt like they were being gnawed by rats, so I moved closer to the entrance. The anti-aircraft guns were booming.</p>
<p>Ji Xing and Mingde had gone to the newspaper office. Ji Xing had a brother named Youhai who was still in high school. This lively young man, wearing a set of yellow canvas Zhongshan uniform and a pair of black, inverted lamb-horn-like speakers, stood on the steps of the entrance, watching the situation in the sky and reporting to the people in the trench one by one. One person in the trench said to me: Youhai is our sentry.</p>
<p>"He's very interesting, let me be a sentry for you too!" I said, and I simply stood on the steps.</p>
<p>"Mr. Guo, come down, it's dangerous," said the people in the trench.</p>
<p>"Mr. Guo, go down, it's dangerous," said Youhai outside the trench.</p>
<p>"Give me that speaker," I finally listened to them, only asking Youhai for his pair of inverted lamb horns.</p>
<p>Youhai put the speakers on me. The sound was to be heard louder.</p>
<p>The duel between the anti-aircraft guns and the enemy planes was really spectacular.</p>
<p>As far as I could see, there were initially eleven enemy planes flying over, turning from the south to the east of the city to prepare to disperse. The anti-aircraft guns hidden everywhere roared to the sky at times, and the gun smoke pierced through the enemy planes' formation. The smoke and clouds were closely connected with the shadows of the planes, making it difficult to distinguish clearly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was an especially solid cannon sound, and the tenth plane in the enemy formation, carrying a plume of black smoke, fell like a comet.</p>
<p>"Well done, really well done! An enemy plane has been shot down," Youhai reported to the trench with great joy.</p>
<p>After one enemy plane was hit, the others scattered, and after the anti-aircraft gun smoke competed with them for a while, they each fled.</p>
<p>The music in the sky took a break. Youhai and I simply left the trench and sat on the mound to watch. There was not a single pedestrian on the street except for the guarding soldiers. Needless to say, all means of transportation had long disappeared.</p>
<p>The silent street, the sea of silence, but in the silent road, there was a surging tide of willpower.</p>
<p>Before long, another squadron of enemy planes came. This time there were fifteen, still coming from the south, but turning to the northwest of the city to disperse. The anti-aircraft gun smoke competed with them even more closely. Suddenly, there was another especially solid cannon sound, and one of the enemy planes emitted a red light, and black smoke rose from the red light, like a comet, and fell.</p>
<p>Well done, really well done! Another enemy plane has been shot down! Youhai jumped up, reporting to the trench with even greater joy than before.</p>
<p>Why does it emit red light? I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"That must be because the fuel tank was hit," Youhai said to me very knowledgeably.</p>
<p>The enemy plane that was shot down fell in the northwest area of the city and also started a fire.</p>
<p>The other enemy planes flew around in a panic for a while, and then fled.</p>
<p>For a good while, the sky and the earth were still and silent, without any sound.</p>
<p>"It's really delightful. I came to Nanjing and saw our aerial battle with my own eyes, and I saw our anti-aircraft guns shoot down two enemy planes with my own eyes. It's really delightful," I said to Youhai with great emotion.</p>
<p>"It's not easy for anti-aircraft guns to hit planes. I saw it with my own eyes for the first time today."</p>
<p>"Why don't we see our planes coming?"</p>
<p>"Our planes are fighting the enemy outside the city, blocking the enemy planes. If the enemy planes break into the airspace of the city, we use anti-aircraft guns to shoot them down. Fighting in the airspace of the city, causing stray bullets to fly around, is quite dangerous for the citizens."</p>
<p>Youhai seemed to understand the process of the battle very well. Whether it was true or not, I don't know. Anyway, it was a casual conversation between young people, so I'll just record it here.</p>
<p>The air raid alarm lasted especially long, and the sun pressed on my head a little painfully, teasing me a little unbearably.</p>
<p>"I see that the alarm is about to be lifted. Let's go back," I urged Youhai.</p>
<p>"Okay, it's probably going to be lifted soon."</p>
<p>Youhai accompanied me back to the entrance, and he said: "Oh, you have foresight, the alarm has been lifted."</p>
<p>He heard the whistle of the all-clear alarm, but I still didn't hear anything.</p>
<p>Before long, the people in the trench also came back, and everyone was smiling happily.</p>
<p>Then, there was a phone call from Mingde of the Xinmin Newspaper Office, and the news reported in this phone call added even more joy to everyone's joy.</p>
<p>It is said that in this enemy plane attack, our planes blocked it outside the city for a long time, and only a part of it broke into the airspace of the city.</p>
<p>It is also said that our anti-aircraft guns hit three planes in a row at Pukou with one cannon. How did they hit them in a row? It was because one cannon hit the enemy plane's bomb, the bomb exploded, and it itself injured two planes, and they fell down together.</p>
<p>One cannon hitting three planes will probably become a saying in the future. This is more modern and memorable than the old "killing two birds with one stone".</p>
<p>The enemy declared that it would turn Nanjing into ashes.</p>
<p>But I saw with my own eyes that the enemy turned into ashes in Nanjing.</p>

<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>The Enemy's First Military Wavering</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhonghua</p>
<p>It has only been two and a half months since the enemy launched a large-scale invasion against us. However, because the war is not progressing smoothly as planned, the first symbol of military wavering has now appeared. The most obvious manifestation of this symbol is that the five general offensives in Shanghai have failed to achieve the expected results. As a result, many parties within the enemy's country immediately raised "criticisms," believing that such a large-scale invasion entailed too much sacrifice and was not worth the cost. Naturally, under the enemy's strict wartime news censorship, the news of this internal wavering cannot be clearly revealed; however, the symbol of this wavering has been unintentionally displayed in the enemy's official news propaganda.</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. on the 17th of this month, Tokyo Radio broadcast an interview with a certain naval officer by a special correspondent from the Domei News Agency. In the question-and-answer session, there were the following two passages:</p>
<p>'Question: What is the recent situation on the Shanghai front?</p>
<p>'Answer: There is no change. The Japanese army is still carrying out operations according to the established plan with the cooperation of the army, navy, and air force. Recently, I have heard that some people in the country are criticizing the military operations for not being able to unfold quickly. To be honest, it is difficult to progress quickly in the Shanghai battle due to the limitations of the terrain........</p>
<p>'Question: What about the war in the South?</p>
<p>'Answer: The strategy for the war in the South is mainly bombing. The naval blockade is also very difficult. It can be said that the soldiers are suffering more than the actual situation.'</p>
<p>These two passages are really worth savoring. The most noteworthy points are the following three: ㊀ It is now definitely proven that some people in Japan are criticizing the military progress for not being able to be swift. ㊁ Japanese military authorities have 'honestly admitted' that it is 'by no means easy' to progress swiftly. ㊂ The 'hardship' of the Japanese soldiers in combat has proven the difficulties and pains they have been experiencing, which outsiders cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Two and a half months of invasion, and the enemy has already exposed its first military wavering; therefore, it is only natural that various wavering and uneasy growths will occur in a long-term war of aggression. To be honest, it is truly unimaginable the pain the people of a country with a weak economic foundation like Japan will feel, and the crisis it will contain in the future if it ventures to engage in a prolonged and arduous war. This point also proves that we are confident about the prospects for our long-term resistance.</p>
<p>We also know that the Japanese imperialist military preparations were originally based on "quick victory." Therefore, at the beginning of this large-scale invasion against us by the enemy army, Konoe had repeatedly stated to his own people that he wanted to quickly end this war. Later, when the enemy army launched general offensives against Shanghai time and time again, the military commanders always set deadlines to break through our first line of defense. However, the enemy's expectations repeatedly failed. In desperation, Konoe and Sugiyama had no choice but to announce that this war would be a long-term war, with no hope of ending within 1937. At the same time, in the talks that the Japanese rulers gave to their citizens, they did not conceal the seriousness of this adventurous invasion for the future of Japanese imperialism. At times, they even exaggerated excessively, enticing the oppressed masses of Japan to endure sacrifices and support this war of aggression.</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, when members of the Japanese Provisional Cabinet Council, Machida, Maeda, Akita, Anbo, Suetsugu, Matsuoka, and 　垣, met with reporters, General Suetsugu, the former commander of the Third Fleet, said: "The current situation is more significant and serious than the Russo-Japanese War. If Japan does not strive to carry out its desired objectives and achieve perfect results, the future will be very dangerous." (According to Tokyo Radio broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on the 15th.) The so-called "very dangerous future" is precisely the honest words of the Japanese imperialist rulers. Two and a half months of all-out war have given the aggressors the first serious warning. The aggressors are already wavering! They have already imagined the tragedy for the future of Japanese imperialism after their invasion of China hits a wall!</p>
<p>However, even though we say this, we know that the Japanese imperialist warlords will never have any regrets. They believe that in order to carry out the purpose of aggression and "harvest perfect results," they can avoid the dangers of the future. Therefore, their tragic cries are intended to beg for the loyalty of the Japanese working masses, not to rise up in revolution, so that their aggression can painfully sustain itself.</p>
<p>At present, when the Japanese imperialist aggression mechanism has encountered its first setback, we know that this wavering will not immediately lead to its collapse. But we believe that as long as we resolutely resist, the exposure of internal wavering phenomena, one after another, will be the death knell of Japanese imperialism, one by one. In the end, its collapse is inevitable.</p>

If calculated according to the current market price, it is more than this amount.

<h3>Properly Plan to Relieve Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Forwarded the Order to the Social Affairs Bureau for Compliance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government approved the Ministry of Industry's request, considering that after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, factories closed down one after another, and the number of unemployed workers was very large, urgently needing to find ways to relieve them. Unemployed workers should be registered as soon as possible, and relief plans should be properly planned. It is heard that the order has been forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for compliance. Because the Social Affairs Bureau has already organized a committee to handle the relief of unemployed workers, the municipal government's instructions have been forwarded to the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee for compliance.</p>
<h3>Ende Wheel Alters Course to Tongzhou</h3>
<p>The China-Italy Shipping Company, for the convenience of Shanghai refugees going to Ningbo and other places north of the Yangtze River, has already dispatched the Ende Wheel, which sails the Shanghai-Ningbo line. Over 100,000 refugees have benefited from its service, being carried to Ningbo Zhenhai. Now that the weather is getting colder, there are still many refugees from Shanghai north of the Yangtze River who urgently need to be transported back to their hometowns. The company has decided to add another ship, the Deping, which will sail to Ningbo, replacing the Ende, which will be rerouted to the new Tongzhou line. The service is scheduled to start next week. The Italian Consul in Shanghai has notified the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy to take note that Italian ships entering and leaving Wusong shall not be obstructed or inspected by Japanese warships.</p>
<h3>Central Government Key Personnel Send Telegrams of Condolence to Vice President Kong</h3>

Subsequently, he received telegrams from Chairman Lin, Chairman Wang, President Jiang, and other key central figures such as Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, Dai Chuanxian, the President of the Examination Yuan, Ye Chuqiang, the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, Zhang Qun, the Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, and various ministers such as Wang Chonghui, He Yingqin, Shao Lizi, and Zhu Jiahua, all extending their welcome and condolences. The telegrams from Chairman Lin, Chairman Wang, and President Yu are recorded below to give a general idea. Lin's telegram stated, "Your return eastward is deeply gratifying. I send this telegram to welcome you with utmost anticipation." Wang's telegram stated, "Your hard work overseas is admired. We have been instructed by you for some time, and we are particularly pleased to know of your thirst for knowledge." Yu's telegram stated, "After reading your published remarks, the country has benefited greatly. We have been instructed by you for some time, and we send this telegram to welcome you."</p>
<h3>US Industrial Reform Committee Passes Boycott of Japanese Goods</h3>

<h3>China-Italy Shipping Company Hosts Banquet for Italian Ambassador and Others</h3>

It was a grand occasion, and the guests and hosts parted in high spirits.</p>
<h3>Zoo's Wild Animals to Be Housed in Safe Zone</h3>
<p>In Case of Enemy Bombing Damage, Escape of Wild Animals Would Be Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district, although not very large, is well-arranged and houses many rare and exotic animals. Therefore, it usually attracts many visitors, and the ticket revenue is sufficient to cover its expenses. A stray bullet recently hit the roof of the zoo's office building, reportedly an unexploded anti-aircraft shell, causing no damage. However, the zoo's director, Shen Xiangrui, is deeply concerned that enemy bombing, which is indiscriminate, could damage the enclosures of the zoo's wild animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, and bears. If these animals were to escape, the harm to nearby residents would be unimaginable. Therefore, he consulted with the Zhaofeng Park Zoo and obtained their agreement to temporarily house the zoo's wild animals there. Because the Zhaofeng Park Zoo is quite large and relatively safe, however, that zoo only has sturdy enclosures for bears, and has no other vacant land for housing the animals. The Municipal Zoo has therefore requested an appropriation from the remaining funds in its ticket revenue to build temporary enclosures for the animals to be housed. These temporary enclosures can be moved in the future. The request has been approved by the Municipal Government and work has already begun to hire craftsmen to rush construction. The estimated cost is over six thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Donations of First-Aid Kits from Other Places</h3>
<p>Wartime Soldiers Need First-Aid Kits; Recent Donations from Other Places Are Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Wartime soldiers need first-aid kits. Recent donations from other places have been very enthusiastic. For example, the colleagues of the Wuxi branch of the Shanghai Bank remitted 54 yuan and 6 jiao to the Shanghai branch yesterday, entrusting them to purchase 546 first-aid kits from the China-West Drugstore. In addition, Fang Yunxiang and He Xingrong of the Xinyuan Renji Clothing Store in Tinglin, Songjiang, collected 73 yuan from various sectors of society, and also entrusted the China-West Drugstore to purchase 730 first-aid kits. The drugstore has already remitted these kits to the慰勞委員會 (Comfort Committee) for transportation to the front lines for use. It is reported that 600,000 of these first-aid kits are needed, and it is hoped that donations will continue to be made enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>Enemy Shamelessly Appoints Puppet Baoshan County Magistrate</h3>
<p>Traitor Wu Lansheng Appointed Secretary-General</p>
<p>After our Baoshan county town was occupied by the enemy, a small number of traitors organized a puppet local maintenance association to serve the enemy's purposes. According to news from relevant sources, the enemy still believes that the puppet maintenance association is not reliable enough, and the military department has appointed a Japanese person named Yoshida as the puppet county magistrate, and Wu Lansheng, an opium-addicted traitor who served as the former head of the maintenance association, as the puppet secretary-general. They have actually cobbled together a shameful puppet government. The enemy is shameless and unparalleled in the world.</p>
<h3>The Front Lines Urgently Need Transportation</h3>
<p>Relates to the Shanghai Battle Situation, Eagerly Awaiting Donations</p>
<p>In recent days, the battle at the front lines is in full contact, which is crucial to the overall situation in Shanghai. All support from the rear cannot be neglected in the slightest. However, there is a severe lack of trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and telephones used to communicate military information, which is greatly affecting strategy. It is urgently hoped that our people will share the enemy's hatred and jointly shoulder the responsibility to enthusiastically donate or temporarily supply the above-mentioned urgently needed transportation tools. The more, the better. Please send them to No. 1197 Lafayette Road to be collected and transferred by the Transportation Committee for distribution and use, so as to benefit military needs. This is what is hoped for.</p>

<h3>Intensify the Organization of the People</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>In the midst of a war against foreign aggression, a strict organization of the people is absolutely necessary. This goes without saying.</p>
<p>The 保甲 (baojia) system established by local governments and the mass organizations led by the Party seem to be enthusiastically advancing their work for the sake of resisting the war. However, many of the fighting troops in various places are still complaining that they are not receiving effective assistance from the people. In some places, there are even traitors everywhere, wantonly causing trouble. Why is this?</p>
<p>Obviously, the peacetime organization of the people was not sound enough, so now, despite the efforts to advance the work, it is still unable to deeply penetrate the people and meet the needs during the war of resistance. Responsible governments and party departments in various places, if they do not want to fail the country, must painfully and thoroughly review and overcome the weaknesses exposed in this aspect of work at any time. In particular, they must abandon all factionalism and absorb as many talented and progressive young people as possible. Let them take on the work of organizing the people during the war.</p>
<p>We believe that the vast majority of our compatriots have a full awareness of resisting the enemy. As long as lively and capable organizers reorganize them strictly, they can unleash a very strong force.</p>
<h3>Chairman Jiang Commends Donations of Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Anyone Who Donates or Raises 500 or More Pieces Will Receive a Certificate of Commendation</p>
<p>The frontline soldiers have repeatedly received donations of cotton vests and first-aid kits from all walks of life. Chairman Jiang believes that the enthusiasm of the people is commendable and has instructed the Military Commission to transfer the matter to the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee for verification. Anyone who donates or raises 500 or more cotton vests will receive a certificate of commendation. The committee has already prepared separate forms. However, in cases where donations have been made continuously and have exceeded 500 pieces, the receipts, numbers, names, and quantities of the various慰勞會 (comfort committee) should be copied and sent to the accounting section of the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee on Yu Qiaqing Road for verification, so as to facilitate verification and listing for commendation. Yesterday, the committee also received 400 cotton vests from Tong Yuting and others sent by the Yang Xiang Various Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association. It is reported that there is a great need for cotton vests and first-aid kits, and it is still hoped that donations will continue to be made.</p>

Thank you very much. This letter is sent in advance to inform you that it is hoped that you will check and inform your affiliates to follow the same procedure. This is very important."</p>
<h3>Beijing-Hankou Line Resumes Flights</h3>
<p>Wuhu is the Starting and Ending Point, Anqing Station Does Not Land</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Post Office news, the Beijing-Hankou route operated by China National Aviation Corporation has now resumed flights. Flights operate in opposite directions every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. However, the eastern end is temporarily using Wuhu as the starting and ending point. Mail between Wuhu and Nanjing will be transported by China National Aviation Corporation's vehicles. When the plane passes through Anqing Station, it will not land temporarily because the airfield problem has not yet been resolved. In addition, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the original plan was to use postal planes to transport mail exclusively, without passengers. However, the postal plane is under repair and cannot fly for the time being.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Reduced by Four 角 (jiao)</h3>
<p>Grain Transit Tax Has Been Waived, Rice Price Restored to Original Limit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Food Regulation Committee previously stated that the Ministry of Finance was collecting local transit taxes, and rice and grain were also included in the local products. Therefore, it was requested that the collection of transit tax on rice be exempted to maintain people's food supply. At the same time, it was announced that before approval was obtained, various types of rice and grain would be increased by 4 jiao per dan. Now that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Jianghai Customs to allow the exemption of transit tax on all rice, grains, and wheat from the 18th of this month, it is hereby announced to all rice sellers in this city that the price of all types of rice and grain sold will be reduced by 4 jiao from today. The highest price for white粳 (japonica rice) should still not exceed 14 yuan, and the medium grades should be reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Replies to the Federation of Trade Unions by Telegram</h3>
<p>The city’s Federation of Trade Unions recently received a telegram from the Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner’s Office, which read: “To the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and the Shanghai Industrial Circle’s National Salvation Association, we are grateful for your telegram and deeply moved. Resisting foreign aggression is the duty of soldiers. We are deeply moved by your encouragement and will certainly supervise our troops to kill the enemy and strive to make up for the war of national revolution.” Special telegram in reply, Yan Xishan, Seal.</p>
<h3>Pu Qiting Generously Assists the Family of Song Shujun</h3>
<p>Song Shujun, a member of the 8th Rescue Team of the City's Rescue Committee, died of overwork while rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line.

The committee has sent a letter of thanks and hopes that all sectors of society can also generously donate to comfort Song Shujun's loyal spirit.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Workers of the Tenth District Donate Funds to Console Soldiers</h3>
<p>Xieshunxiang Hengji Donates Cotton Clothes to Refugees</p>
<p>The City’s 10th District Cotton Textile Industry Trade Union, following a notice from the Federation of Trade Unions to donate funds to console soldiers resisting the enemy, immediately convened workers from the Shenxin No. 8 Factory to discuss the matter. As a result, they have raised a donation of 1,495 yuan, 2 jiao and 9 fen. It has been designated that 500 yuan will be used to console the soldiers in North China, 500 yuan to console the soldiers fighting in the淞滬 (Songhu) area, and the remaining 495 yuan, 2 jiao and 9 fen will be used for refugee relief. The funds have been transferred to the Shanghai Local Association for separate allocation. The enthusiasm of the workers of these two factories is commendable, and it is hoped that workers in other industries will unite and donate to increase the strength of the resistance against the enemy.</p>
<p>The City’s International Relief Committee, yesterday received 500 sets of newly made cotton-padded jackets and trousers from Mr. Hengji of Xieshunxianghao on Caishi Street, in view of the cold weather, and delivered them to the committee to distribute to refugees in the shelters. His enthusiasm and generosity are admirable. However, it is heard that the shelters of the committee are built with reed mats, which are colder than other shelters, and the number of refugees is quite large, so the supply of cotton clothes is far from sufficient, and the need for cotton quilts is even greater. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate more and send them to the committee on the third floor of the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Certifies Goods May Not Carry Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the various industry associations, stating: "We are writing to inform you that, for the convenience of cargo transportation for various industries, the association has drafted a type of cargo transportation certificate, which is issued to businesses upon request by the industry association. The above-mentioned certificate has now been approved by the commander of the ×××× Command Headquarters and all affiliated troops have been ordered to facilitate its passage. However, the goods transported by each business should be carefully examined and should not carry enemy goods or contraband. In order to be cautious, the association has printed a standard format for requesting the issuance of cargo transportation certificates, which should be filled out in accordance with the format and submitted to the association for verification when members request it. This measure will be implemented from the 22nd of this month, and we hope you will pay attention to it."</p>
<h3>Zhu Shi'en Establishes Refugee Hospital</h3>
<p>Well-known figure Zhu Shi'en is usually benevolent and enthusiastic about relief matters. Mr. Zhu believes that the enemy's re-invasion of Shanghai this time can only be survived by a long-term war of resistance, and rear relief is particularly important. All citizens should do their best. He has established the Shi'en Refugee Hospital at No. 456 Jiujiang Road in this city. Refugees and wounded soldiers, whether hospitalized or outpatients, will not be charged for medical treatment. The day before yesterday, his son, Mei Su, and Miss Zhi Cheng, the daughter of Mr. An Weimo, held a wedding ceremony at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge, with Mr. Fang Jiaobo as the officiant. The groom and bride are a talented and beautiful couple. Mr. Zhu simplified everything due to the serious national crisis, saving materials and resources. Although no invitations were sent, the guests were still present and the ceremony was quite grand.</p>
<h3>Yangzi Dance Hall Enthusiastically Provides Relief</h3>
<p>Eagerly Hoping that Other Dance Halls and Theaters Will Respond</p>
<p>The Yangzi Dance Hall on Yunnan Road, in view of the fact that our loyal and brave soldiers are fighting bloody battles and urgently need relief after being wounded, has decided to contribute 2% of its daily business income from the 21st of last month to the Shanghai Relief Committee through the Shanghai Daily to pay for relief expenses. As of the 15th of this month, nearly 700 yuan has been raised. The relief committee has already sent a letter of thanks and hopes that the dance hall can continue to donate and that other dance halls and cinemas will respond.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Applicants for Transportation Engineering Cadre Class</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the enrollment of students for the transportation engineering team cadre training class organized by a certain agency in this city, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic.

<h3>Fire Department Report</h3>
<p>On the 19th of this month, the Fire Department reported 19 fire alarms, all of which occurred in the war zone. The department's ambulance was dispatched 11 times and transported a total of 11 patients and injured persons to the hospital, including one person who was injured by shrapnel. The fire engine was dispatched twice, both in Yangshupu. The fire was quite fierce and lasted for a long time before it was extinguished.</p>
<h3>Zhang Deyi Relocates Clinic</h3>
<p>Zhang Deyi and his wife, of the Qianyi Orthopedic Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, are nearly sixty years old but still tirelessly serve the community. Since the start of the Shanghai battle, their original residence has been relocated due to the war to No. 696, Xuanyi Temple, at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Rue Cardinal Foch, telephone number 30601. They continue to provide medical services, both medicine and treatment. Those injured by the enemy's aggression and injured refugees are all given their utmost effort to help. Recently, it has been heard that there are still many people with fractures who dare not seek medical treatment because they are afraid that the place is not Mr. Zhang's clinic. Therefore, this information is disclosed so that those with fractures can seek treatment and avoid the delay that could lead to permanent disability.</p>
<h3>Returned Overseas Chinese Wang Zhonghai Talks About the Extreme Economic Difficulties Facing Japan</h3>
<p>Frequent Conscription in the Country Leads to Widespread Grievances, Business for Overseas Chinese Declines, Many Plan to Return</p>
<p>Japan's launch of the invasion of China, as those in the know had predicted, is only accelerating the collapse of its national economy and plunging the country into serious difficulties. According to Mr. Wang Zhonghai, an overseas Chinese who returned to the country recently on the French postal ship "Andre Lebon," since Japan's unprovoked provocation at the Lugouqiao in North China and the outbreak of the August 13 Shanghai battle, its domestic military has been frequently conscripted. Not only have young men in the countryside been forced to serve in the military, but also workers in factories and shop assistants in cities have been successively drafted to serve as reservists for dispatch. As for military supplies, the people are forced to provide them, which is extremely demanding. Now, various taxes have been increased one after another, while prices have soared, and supply and demand are unbalanced. Life is painful, and public grievances are boiling. Looking at its domestic economic situation, it has fallen into an extreme situation. The price of timber and galvanized iron has increased more than three times compared to before the war. Now, if cities need to build houses, the government has restricted the use of steel to no more than five tons, and violators will be fined. This shows the shortage of military supplies and the urgency of replenishment. In short, if our country can wage a protracted war of resistance, then the invading army will inevitably retreat due to the inability of its domestic economy to support it. As for the business of overseas Chinese in Japan, it has naturally plummeted. Now, in view of the inability to live in that country for a long time and in order to express their determination to resist the war, many plan to return.</p>

<h3>Our Army's Left Wing Launches a Full-Scale Counterattack, the Enemy Spying on Dachang is Already in a Predicament</h3>
<p>Our Heavy Artillery Bombards the Enemy's Position All Night, Achieving Results; Our Army Continues to Advance at Various Strongholds on the Left Wing; The Situation at Gejiapailou is in a Standoff</p>
<p>For several consecutive days, the enemy has been using all its strength to attack our Dachang line on several routes. On the front, they advanced south along the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, once breaking through our Maqiaozhai position. After our counterattack, they were repelled and are now stalemated in the Yujiazhai area. Our forces are strong and our defenses are solid, and the enemy on the front has suffered a serious blow. To the west of the highway, the enemy broke through from Heida Huangzhai and advanced to Bashiqiao, crossing the Fengcun Pond and reaching the area between Gejiapailou and Huanggang, attempting to encircle and attack from the side, attacking Dachang. After our army's strict interception and encirclement, the enemy was in a difficult situation and trapped in a predicament. As of this noon, the enemy on this line had no more strength to attack and is now actively reorganizing, replenishing, and gathering reinforcements, planning to make a final struggle. At dawn this morning, there was a fierce battle between the two sides, but it only lasted for an hour. The two armies are now in a stalemate. We are holding the original defense line, and the enemy will never succeed. To the east of the highway, the enemy has not dared to try lightly. There has been no major battle since last night until this noon. Last night, our artillery positions on the left wing bombarded the enemy's position on Yunzaobang without interruption, and the enemy's fortifications were severely damaged. With the cover of fierce artillery fire, our left wing launched a full-scale counterattack against the enemy. The enemy was caught off guard, leaving corpses everywhere and fleeing in panic. Our army quickly returned victoriously to its original position and advanced hundreds of meters in several places. More than a dozen enemy planes took off at night, circling and reconnoitering in places such as Zhenru and Dachang, and releasing flares for indiscriminate bombing, but we suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Trying to Break Through at Gejiapailou This Morning Were Repelled</h3>
<p>The Enemy Suffered Heavy Losses and Its Activity Greatly Reduced; Confrontation Across the River in the Batouzhai Area</p>
<p>To the north of Dachang, the battle is still raging. Our army's defense line is extremely solid. The enemy, who used all its strength to attack Dachang, suffered heavy losses after being attacked by our army in Gejiapailou, Huanggang, Yujiazhai, and other places, and dared not continue to advance. After two days and two nights of bloody battles, the enemy troops were obviously exhausted and unable to support themselves. Last night, the enemy's activity was greatly reduced and was only able to barely support our army's fierce counterattack. The intruding enemy troops were extremely busy building fortifications in the rear, preparing for our army's counterattack, and using the area as a base for continuing their attacks. At 4:30 this morning, the enemy troops attempted to break through and attacked our army fiercely, and the bloody battle resumed. Our army bravely went forward and wiped them out. Under the concentrated fire of the enemy troops, they fell forward and continued to charge, killing countless enemies who were trying to break out. After this heavy blow, the enemy troops retreated to their original position. This morning, the front line only had mutual shelling and machine gun fire. The enemy in Gejiapailou and Huanggang, west of the highway, is still surrounded by our army. Our army is about to launch a major offensive to annihilate them. To the northwest of Gejiapailou, on the south bank of Fengcun Pond, west of Zhangjialouxia, in the area of Batouzhai, Zhujiazhai, and Houjiazhai, the Chen site on our army's left wing is extremely solid. Our enemy armies are confronting each other across the river, firing at each other with artillery, machine guns, and rifles. Our army is closely guarded, not allowing them to cross. There have been no changes in the important positions.</p>
<h3>Our Left Wing Army Counterattacked Last Night</h3>
<p>Our Artillery Fiercely Bombed the Enemy's Position; Gejiapailou is Controlled by Us</p>
<p>Our reporter recently met with a military officer who arrived in Shanghai this morning from the front line, who told us about the battle last night. A summary is given below: ㊀ Last night at 8 o'clock, the various units of our left wing were ordered to counterattack. A certain senior officer personally went to the front line to command, and the morale was boosted. By midnight, all units had advanced forward. The enemy had been attacked fiercely by our army for several days and its morale had been weakened. ㊁ Last night, our artillery positions continuously fired shells, bombarding the enemy army like rain. It was heard clearly in the west of Shanghai. However, the enemy rarely returned fire. ㊂ Several enemy planes circled back and forth in the Zhenru area after 8 o'clock last night and released flares, intending to detect the artillery positions, but our army paid no attention and continued to fire shells. The enemy planes gained nothing. ㊃ Gejiapailouzhai has been reduced to scorched earth after being destroyed by artillery fire. It is now under our army's control and the enemy has no power to attack. ㊄ In Dachang, our army has built solid fortifications. Although the enemy is stubborn, it will be difficult to invade.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Progress in Luodian</h3>
<p>The enemy disregards international law by using tear gas; newly arrived troops are exceptionally cowardly.</p>
<p>According to a certain director who returned this morning from the Luodian front lines, the enemy troops arrayed with their backs to the Yunzaobang River have suffered significant losses in strength after four days and nights of bloody battles. However, their ambition to invade Dachang has not been thwarted. According to reliable reports from the front, the enemy troops will draw on the right-wing forces from the Luodian area to replenish their strength south of the Yunzaobang River. A certain commander of our troops guarding the front lines in that area, in order to crush the enemy's plan, adopted a strategy of counter-offense. Starting at 8:00 PM last night, he ordered a general attack on the enemy. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. When the director left the front lines at midnight, news of victory had already arrived. Our troops on the Shi Xiang Gong Temple and Cao Wang Temple lines have aggressively advanced one thousand several hundred meters towards the enemy in the Luodian area. The battle is still developing fiercely. Furthermore, the small unit of enemy troops that secretly landed at Baimaokou earlier was completely eliminated by our forces yesterday. During the clearing of the battlefield, a portion of ×× shells were found and have been handed over to the higher authorities.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Guangfu reported at 11:30 AM on the 21st that the enemy in the area of Laodan House, Qin House, and Zhangjia Village, northwest of Luodian, has recently been replaced. The discipline of their newly arrived troops is very poor. Whenever they are hit by our aircraft and artillery, they shout loudly and become extremely chaotic and cowardly. They fire their guns wildly day and night to bolster their courage. However, their machine gunners seem quite composed.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Guangfu reported at 11:30 AM on the 21st that the battle lines from Luodian to Guangfu were relatively calm from last night until this morning. Only a unit of enemy troops from the Liuhang area launched a fierce attack on the areas of Laolu House and Xinlu House. Our troops bravely resisted and repelled them after multiple engagements. It is found that Laolu House and Xinlu House are the protective screen southeast of Guangfu. The enemy's invasion of Guangfu has been under considerable threat in recent days. Therefore, the enemy is extremely keen on invading these two locations. However, we have long stationed strong forces there, and it will be difficult for the enemy to succeed if they attack.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attack on Jiangwan Immediately Repelled</h3>
<p>In the Jiangwan area, after our forces heavily attacked and inflicted serious damage on the enemy forces surrounding the Sijing Ball Field in the past two days, our forces simultaneously launched a fierce offensive against the enemy from the direction of the Sports Association Road, along Xiangyin Road, and Fudan University in a large encirclement. Our forces have made considerable progress. The rest of the two lines from Jiangwan to Zhabei have seen no fierce fighting, except for forward outposts engaging and artillery duels. This morning at dawn, the enemy in the downtown area, under the cover of armored vehicles, launched an offensive against our Jiangwan positions with a large detachment of infantry. Although their attack was fierce, it was immediately repelled by our concentrated firepower, and after an hour of intense fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand and retreated, leaving many corpses behind. Reliable sources reported that there were occasional skirmishes around Baoshan Road and Yinxiang District last night, with the sound of machine guns starting and stopping intermittently. Between 5:30 AM and 6:00 AM this morning, enemy warships opened fire on the Baoshan Road area, while there was artillery fire in the Dachang area. Around 8:00 AM, enemy aircraft dropped three heavy bombs on the Lianglu Administration Building. The railway line west of the North Station was also bombed. At the same time, enemy troops shelled the area around the Maigen Road station. A large fire broke out behind the Nippon Yusen wharf in Pudong. Around 11:00 AM, there were concentrated machine gun and mortar fire in the area of Beijiangxi Road (the section where roads were built across the boundary) and the Jinghu Railway line.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bomb Zhabei Again</h3>
<p>Fire near the North Station extinguished immediately</p>
<p>Starting at 7:00 AM today, three groups of enemy aircraft, consisting of three and two aircraft each, circled again over Baoshan Road, Xinmin Road, and the public concession along the Suzhou River. At 7:30 AM, the three enemy aircraft dropped three more bombs, bombing the Lianglu Administration Building and the surrounding areas of the North Station. Numerous bombs also fell on Qiujiang Road, North Han Bridge, and Song Park Road. At 8:30 AM and around 12:00 PM, three more aircraft dropped six heavy bombs on the North Station area, creating thick smoke all around the station. The newly renovated east and west sides of the sampan factory along the Suzhou River were also hit by three bombs each. The fire at the intersection of Changan Road and Haichang Road, which had already been extinguished by the fire brigade, was reignited by continuous bombing from enemy aircraft. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished again after the fire brigade made strenuous efforts.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that before dawn this morning, the enemy at the Sijing Ball Field attacked our guard lines near Fudan University and Tanjia House for the second time, but were repelled each time. In the Baziqiao House area, the enemy continuously fired to create disturbances. However, after daybreak, the entire line became quiet.</p>
<h3>We Shot Down an Enemy Aircraft at Huacao Town</h3>
<p>Both pilots killed instantly</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that at 10:00 AM this morning, an enemy aircraft was shot down by us and crashed near the Suzhou River in Huacao Town, catching fire upon impact. Both pilots were killed instantly.</p>
<h3>Enemy Officers' Deaths and Injuries Confirmed</h3>
<p>Japanese aircraft frequently crash</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the enemy suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Liuhang on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month. Their military headquarters announced that six officers with the rank of major or higher were killed or seriously wounded. Tokujiro Iizuka died in battle at Sujia House; Jojiro Unno was seriously wounded by a bullet at Yangjia House; Masao Sato was seriously wounded by a bullet in Liuhang, with a hole through his right chest. Additionally, Sueki Nakayama died in battle; Teiichiro Inaba and Michikazu Ishida were both seriously wounded, but the locations were not specified. Furthermore, the enemy, realizing the weakness of their air force and the significant sacrifices of their combatants, is actively engaged in training, leading to aircraft accidents almost every day. According to the Tokyo Asahi, a fighter plane crashed at Kagamigahara Airfield on the afternoon of the 6th, completely destroying the aircraft and killing Chief Petty Officer Tsutomu Imai on the spot. The Osaka Mainichi also reported that on the morning of the 9th, two aircraft collided in the air at Kasumigaura Naval Airfield. One aircraft was piloted by instructor Lieutenant Commander Motohachi Miyazaki, who crashed to the ground and died.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Carried Out Nine Night Raids Causing Extremely Heavy Damage to the Enemy</h3>
<p>Yufeng Cotton Mill hit by bombs and caught fire; military supplies destroyed, casualties heavy</p>
<p>Our air force carried out nine raids on enemy positions between 7:09 PM last night and 2:18 AM this morning. The enemy opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. Fragments of artillery shells fell within the Huisi area. Our forces dropped bombs in the following locations: ⑴ 10:35 PM, Pingliang Road (near Dinghai Road); ⑵ 1:20 AM, Yangshupu Road (near Linqing Road); ⑶ 1:50 AM, Yangshupu Road (near Ewo Cotton Mill). All three locations caught fire due to being hit by bombs. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and losses.</p>
<p>At 1:40 AM this morning, our air force dropped bombs and bombarded enemy positions in the eastern district. An incendiary bomb hit the Ewo Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, causing a large fire. There were shrapnel in the reeling and sorting rooms. Indian staff members in the factory reported to the fire brigade, which dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire. The Yufeng Cotton Mill on Dinghai Road was also hit by bombs and caught fire, destroying six staff residences. Military supplies stockpiled there by the enemy were completely destroyed, causing even heavier casualties.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles North of Dachang Ceased Not All Night</h3>
<p>Our forces retake Huangjia House in a night raid; we defend our original positions on both sides of the highway</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency accompanying the army from Jiangwan reported at 12:25 PM on the 21st that battles raged all night at several locations south of the Yunzaobang River, along Fengcun Pond and the Liuhang-Dachang highway. After the enemy's southward advance was blocked and their westward attacks failed, they continued to harass us, as they still had considerable progress along the highway.</p>
<p>Enemy fiercely attacks Gaoqiao House</p>
<p>Gaoqiao House, a critical point on the highway, was subjected to the fiercest attacks. The enemy was stationed at Zhangyu House and Changjilou, where they massed large forces. We were encircled by the enemy from the northwest on both sides. The enemy at Zhangyu House attacked last midnight. We fought bravely and held out until this morning. The enemy attacks were very fierce, and the enemy at Changjilou also continuously harassed us in support. However, we counterattacked from the left and right, handling the situation with ease. By daybreak, the enemy had not succeeded and gradually retreated, and the battle became quiet. At Luzhai and Sujiaqiao House, small groups of enemy troops constantly harassed us from last night until this morning, resulting in only minor skirmishes.</p>
<p>Our night raids were quite successful</p>
<p>Huangjia House, west of the highway, was attacked and captured by the enemy on the afternoon of the 18th, using multiple tanks. However, the enemy only stationed a small number of troops there. Yesterday, we attempted a night raid, which was quite successful. The enemy offered slight resistance and then retreated north. Our forward outposts retook the position. Yu House, about 600 meters south of Huangjia House, is also an important stronghold west of the highway. The enemy attacked three times since 10:00 PM last night. The attack at 2:00 AM this morning was particularly intense, making the battle the fiercest. However, our forces defended our original positions throughout. When the enemy realized they could not succeed by daybreak, they also retreated.</p>
<p>Enemy troops gather on both sides of the highway</p>
<p>The battles at all locations became quiet after daybreak. Soon, multiple enemy tanks advanced slowly from the south of Tang Bridge, still attempting to encroach towards Dachang. Our Chenjia House, Jixiang House, and Maqiao House are located on both sides of the highway, serving as the protective screen for Dachang. Enemy tanks massed there and launched fierce attacks. Multiple enemy aircraft dropped bombs to assist in the battle. Our forces calmly fought back under the combined air and ground attack of the enemy. As of the time of the report, the battle was still ongoing.</p>

<p>Leaves room for Japan to maneuver; Davis issues statement before departure</p>
<p>[New York] Davis, the chief representative of the United States attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, met with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park City yesterday to discuss the situation of the meeting for three hours. He also met with Belgian Ambassador to the United States Pontus today. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, he led the delegation on the "Washington" liner to Europe. Before the departure, many reporters, especially reporters from China and Japan, asked if the severity of the international situation was equal to that of 1914. Davis refused to comment, saying only, 'I am not a prophet. We are going to Brussels this time at the invitation of the Belgian government to seek constructive and peaceful solutions to the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with Article 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty. We have neither taken any constraints nor hold any prejudices. In short, the US government is prepared to seek any path that can achieve peace.' The spokesman for the US delegation said that the Brussels meeting would focus purely on the Nine-Power Treaty and would not be involved with the League of Nations. However, if the meeting ultimately fails, the League of Nations will continue to take action. The current position taken by the United States is to leave room for Japan to maneuver.

<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>The soldiers at the front, guarding the land for the country, are fighting bloody battles. Now that the autumn wind is blowing and the air is getting chilly, the public, motivated by patriotism, has donated no less than hundreds of thousands of cotton vests. The three armies receive them as if they have been blessed. This truly boosts morale and stimulates morale. Indirectly, it is enough to chill the enemy's courage and promote its rapid collapse. It is a very meaningful event. The government, seeing the public's enthusiasm, ordered an investigation into incentives, which of course should have government orders. However, the public's voluntary donation does not question whether the government has rewards. It shows that the government, the people, and the army are a cohesive unit. The significance is even greater. Now, the north is already cold. The ice and snow are on the road. Frostbite is imminent. We can expand and enrich it. Change cotton vests to leather vests, and transport them to the north. Let the soldiers hold the key to the northern gates. The government has no worries about the north. I hope the gentlemen and people of the south will enthusiastically donate. We are looking forward to it.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Harass the Coastal Areas of Chaozhou and Shantou</h3>
<p>Destroying the lighthouse in Shantou Port, occupying various small islands, and surveying; fishermen defend themselves and attack enemy boats</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: Enemy warships are blockading the coastal line of Guangdong Province. Outside the port of Shantou, enemy warships often send marines on small electric boats to intercept fishing boats, causing more than 100,000 fishermen in Darang, Nanao, Tuolin, and Haimen to become unemployed. Also, the reefs near Biaojiao and Guangao are undulating. This place is close to the construction line and is a must-pass place for ships sailing at night. There is a lighthouse on a small island in the area, managed by a foreigner sent by the sea and several Chinese workers, living in a stone house on the island. Apart from raising medicine and taros, their food depends entirely on the supply from Shantou. In the latter half of last month, it had also been invaded by more than 30 enemy marines who destroyed the lighthouse, forced the foreigner in the lighthouse to hand over self-defense guns, and forcibly seized all the liquor, meat, and canned food they had made. As a result, personnel at the Zhuxia and Chi Han lighthouses have resigned. Now, the lighthouses no longer emit light at night, which makes it very dangerous for ships passing through the area. Also, the enemy marines had invaded the vicinity of Guangao and were repelled by the local ×× team. After surveying several small islands in the area, the enemy has already left because they were not suitable. In the 26th year [of the Republic], enemy warships sent patrol boats to attack fishing boats near both Aos. The fishing boats immediately hoisted their sails and quickly returned to Ao Island's Qianjiang. The enemy boats still followed and opened fire. The soldiers and militiamen guarding Qianjiang saw the enemy boats approaching and returned fire, covering the escaping fishermen. The enemy then retreated. In less than an hour, another enemy warship sailed to Nanao and shelled Qianjiang. Our army also returned fire. After two hours, the enemy warship retreated towards Zhao'an. On that day, one or two of our soldiers and civilians were killed or injured. At that time, two wooden boats from Dongshan Island in Fujian Province were carrying passengers and goods to Huanggang in Rao County. They encountered an enemy warship in the sea off Shao'an. The enemy warship immediately sent a patrol boat to chase them. Knowing that their methods were vicious and that there was no chance of survival, the two wooden boats immediately spread out in a figure-eight formation. The fire powder cannons on the boats had also been loaded with medicine and covered with clothes. When the enemy patrol boat approached, they fired cannons, sinking the enemy patrol boat and thirty enemy soldiers into the sea. The enemy warship then opened fire in retaliation. The two wooden boats also sank, killing forty boatmen and passengers. More than a dozen people who were good at swimming were able to swim to the shore of Dagang and survived. The fishermen along the coast hate the enemy deeply. Once they encounter an enemy boat, they will never let it survive. In the past, many fishermen were timid and did not resist. After being captured by the enemy, both of their ears were pierced and strung together with thick iron wires, forty people in a row, and thrown into the sea to play with and amuse themselves, or they were sealed in a cabin and set the ship on fire, burning them to death. The most outrageous thing was to inject poison needles into their arms and send them home. They died of poisoning ten days later. It is heard that enemy ships have recruited former smugglers as guides, because they are familiar with the coastal reefs and the depth of the sea. Therefore, enemy ships dare to go deep into Guangao, Aotou, Donghu, Caogou, Bingzhou, and the lakes. Many of the people driving enemy boats to pursue fishing boats are dressed in white sailor uniforms, but their faces are traitors and smugglers that the fishermen have recognized for many years. The fishermen in Haifeng, facing livelihood problems, decided to arm themselves and go to sea to make a living. Their fishing boats are equipped with fire powder cannons and platform guns. They predict that enemy ships will not necessarily hit them with artillery fire. If enemy patrol boats come after them, they can fight to the death. On the 25th of last month, four large fishing boats were chased and captured by an enemy warship that sent a patrol boat and more than thirty marines to Shanwei. One boat had already been captured and towed to the vicinity of the warship. The fishermen saw that they had reached the final moment and immediately lit fire powder cannons and blasted them towards the warship, killing more than a dozen enemy marines on the spot. Then, they opened fire and sank the enemy patrol boat. The enemy then opened fire and sank the fishing boat, killing and injuring dozens of people. The other two fishing boats took the opportunity to escape. Such a heroic sacrifice was unexpected by the enemy warships. Also, many of the fishermen who were previously captured by enemy warships were burned to death in the cabins. Their inhumanity has reached such an extent, so the fishermen hate them very much.</p>
<p>Enemy warships in the sea area of Chaozhou and Shantou not only send marines on speedboats every day to drive away fishing boats, but also secretly land and practice on the secluded coast in an attempt to expand the scope of harassment. On the 2nd of this month, the enemy troops had broken into Pujangkeng on Nanao Island and cut off the telephone poles there. County magistrate Lin Jiezhi immediately sent a team to search. Eight enemy soldiers fled by boat. Now the telephone lines there have been repaired, and the entire island can talk. The Guandi Temple at Qianjiangwei was hit by eight artillery shells from enemy warships. The front building collapsed and three houses of the militiamen were destroyed. Two civilians were killed and three were injured. On the morning of the 6th, three enemy aircraft flew out to scout the border area between Shao'an and Xiaomin Guangdong, flying far over Jiaoling, Longyan, Zhang Xia, and at high altitude without dropping bombs.</p>
<h3>Wenling Traitorous Merchants Transport Rice to Support the Enemy</h3>
<p>Various Groups Request Strict Punishment of Traitorous Merchants</p>
<p>Taizhou Communication: In Songmen, Shitou, and other places in the southern district of Wenling County, some traitorous merchants smuggled 439 bags of rice, pretending to go out to sea. They were seized and taken to the county by the security police stationed at Ruoheng. With the approval of the county government, they were publicly auctioned in the county warehouse a few days ago. Now, the county's Chamber of Commerce, Farmers' Association, Workers' Union, and other groups have jointly telegraphed the county government, asking to detain and investigate the rice-smuggling traitorous merchants, according to Chinese law, and do this for the future.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that traitorous merchants have recently been discovered smuggling rice out to sea in Tingtou, Hefan, and other places in the western district of Wenling. In order to avoid public attention, these traitorous merchants have been very secretive in their smuggling methods. They secretly pack the rice into kerosene tanks, sealing them with tin under the pretext of solidity, tying one end of the rope to the rice tank and the other end to the side of the sea, submerging the rice tank in the seawater, towing it out to sea, and selling it to the enemy in the sea area of Damai Island (where many enemy warships are moored). These traitorous merchants then use the money they get to buy tax-evading goods to sell inland, making even more profit.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Enemy Distributes Absurd Leaflets</p>
<p>At 2:12 PM on the 15th, an enemy plane attacked Songjiang, circling above the four city gates three times. Afterwards, it released a large number of printed materials at a height of 1,000 meters in the western suburbs. An investigation revealed that the printed materials were issued by the enemy's 'New Shen Bao' newspaper, located at 455 Zhapu Road, Shanghai. The content was all in Chinese, with absurd sentences intended to disrupt the rear. Citizens who picked them up tore them up and discarded them on the ground.</p>
<p>Xia Jia-san Destroys Home to Save the Country</p>
<p>Xia Jia-san, a resident south of Jinzhao Temple in this county, recently sent a house and stock certificates from the local telephone company to the Public Organization Committee, requesting that they be sold to generously support the soldiers at the front. The committee approved the request, praising Mr. Xia's destruction of his home to save the country as highly commendable. In addition to a letter of thanks, personnel were dispatched yesterday to verify and receive the items.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Enemy Plane Bombs and Kills Police Officer</p>
<p>The county government was mostly destroyed by enemy planes bombing it on August 23rd. The surrounding area was also largely affected. In recent days, enemy planes have frequently wreaked havoc. Although the residents in the city have all fled, the police station is still on duty to prevent and investigate spies. At 12:30 PM on the 12th of this month, police officer Ma Lian-sheng was on duty near the county government when an enemy plane suddenly came and dropped a bomb, unfortunately hitting him in a vital area and killing him immediately. It is reported that Xu, the head of the county police station, has reported the situation of the officer's diligent and selfless death to County Magistrate Zhang and plans to grant him preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Strafe Danyang</p>
<p>At 1:10 PM on the 15th, six enemy planes flew westward from Shandong, flying very low when passing over Danyang. They circled in the sky for 20 minutes, strafing four times with machine guns over the station and Fusi Temple in the northern suburbs. Each burst of gunfire consisted of about ten shots, approximately 100 meters from the military station. A civilian house was hit by three bullets, and a cook was shot in the head, seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>All Sectors Contribute to National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>For National Salvation Bonds, Jiangdu County has been assigned 600,000 yuan, and a fundraising branch has been established. In addition to separately collecting contributions based on official positions and wealth, land will be taxed at 40% of the total tax amount for the 26th year (i.e., 4 jiao per yuan). Collection began on the 15th of this month. Business employees will be taxed one month's salary, similar to civil servants, with the Chamber of Commerce responsible for collecting and remitting the funds. Teachers and staff will contribute according to their salaries, and middle school students will purchase 5 yuan each. In addition, those who voluntarily subscribe are extremely enthusiastic, and it is expected that the amount collected will exceed the target.</p>
<p>Two Strange Visitors Arrive on Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Train</p>
<p>On the evening train from Zhenjiang to Yangzhou on the 14th, strange merchants (around 40 years old) who had come to buy antiques, along with a local youth (around 20 years old) disguised as Chinese, dressed in Qing student attire, carrying a rough cloth bundle, rushed into Fuyun Gate in rickshaws. A strong man in the same car recognized their appearance and voice (speaking in a northern Beijing accent, but not pure), and quickly reported it to the authorities. After checking the hotel without success, strict orders have been issued to the Baoding and Jia system to investigate and search, and the city gate guards are paying attention.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Providing Grain to the Enemy</p>
<p>The Ning-Shao Martial Law Command recently stated that enemy warships are patrolling overseas, buying grain at high prices. Some unscrupulous gentry and merchants are colluding with each other to smuggle it out. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the coastal county magistrates of the two districts to pay special attention to the investigation and prohibition of this activity.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Hefei</p>
<p>It is reported that since the start of the Shanghai battle, the city has maintained order as usual. However, at 4:10 PM on the 13th, three enemy bombers and three fighter planes, divided into two teams, flew from Bengbu and Tianjia'an along the Huainan Road to Hefei for an air raid. The first team turned towards Zhangdagang outside the east gate and dropped five or six heavy bombs. The second team flew high above the city, circling once from northeast to southwest, dropping six or seven bombs in succession and then retreating along the original route. The air raid alert was lifted at 4:30 PM. Subsequent investigation revealed that the bombs mostly landed in nearby open areas and fields. Except for Gao Jitang, a former member of parliament, who was killed by the bombing, and one Mr. Zhang who was injured, there were no other losses.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau Announcement Regarding Procedures for Sending Secret Telegrams</h3>
<p>Businesses Sending Telegrams to Submit Seal Impressions; Foreign Secret Telegrams Require Consular Certification</p>
<p>Domestic business telegrams in code have resumed being accepted and sent as usual since the 10th of this month. The requirement to add the old store chop and the manager's chop to the bottom of the telegrams from the same date onwards was mentioned in this newspaper on the 11th. Yesterday, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau issued a further announcement stating: It has been previously announced that all sectors sending telegrams should have the store chop and manager's signature or chop on the bottom of the telegrams. In order to facilitate all sectors, the Bureau has prepared a type of seal impression card. All businesses sending telegrams are requested to write to the Bureau to request a seal impression card (stating the name, address, and nature of the business in the letter). Hereafter, the seal impression at the bottom of the telegram will be based on the retained seal impression. Private individuals sending telegrams should still add their occupation and occupational address in addition to their name and address. If necessary, they should also fill out a survey form or seek a shop guarantee. Furthermore, from October 15th onwards, all foreign businesses sending secret telegrams should first ask the consul to provide a letter of responsibility stating that the content of the telegram does not contain any political or military news. If the consul cannot provide a letter of certification, then each secret telegram should have the consul's office stamp on the bottom of the telegram before it can be sent. The Bureau may still request to inspect the codebook for any business telegram at any time. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Mobile Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>Departs for the Jinpu Railway Line</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, the national salvation movement has surged across the country, especially in the theatrical world, which has become even more active. The "China Drama Society," which has always been active in the capital, has twice performed anti-Japanese national salvation plays, such as "The Traitor's Descendants," "Roar Like Hebei," "Alarm," and "Our Homeland." Although there were rumors that the China Drama Society would form a national salvation mobile drama troupe, the news gradually faded. The week before last, it was suddenly learned that Dai Ya, Hong Zhenglun, Leng Bo, and others, who are the backbone of "China Drama," had all come to the town. The reporter visited them and learned that the society had not abandoned its theatrical mission and was working urgently. Because the organization of the national salvation mobile drama troupe had to be firm and solid, and the route and transportation also had to be carefully planned, the departure of the troupe was delayed. It is now heard that the troupe has been prepared and is led by Leng Bo and Hong Zhenglun, and will depart for the north along the Jinpu Railway Line on the 16th. The first stage of the troupe's work will be in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>What Female Compatriots Should Do During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Wu Yufang</p>
<p>We know that the liberation war of the entire Chinese nation has already begun. We must awaken the people of the entire country and mobilize them to participate in these national salvation and war of resistance movements in order to achieve final victory. I think this is a meaning that the majority can understand. What I want to bring up here is how to mobilize our 250 million women across the country to take on the mission of resisting aggression and saving the country.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war of resistance in North China and Shanghai, in addition to the general rescue personnel serving at the front, women have also risen up to participate enthusiastically in nursing, comfort, recruitment, relief singing, etc., and have been able to show a proactive spirit of service. In particular, in the wartime service corps of the Boy Scouts in Shanghai, there are already more than 300 girl scouts participating in the work. This fearless spirit of the girls of the new China can be said to be a first discovery. The female team members who participated in the Red Cross are also as brave as the male team members, braving bullets and shrapnel on the front line to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. Although the enemy disregarded international law, at the Southeast Hospital in Zhenru, when many Boy Scouts and Red Cross rescue teams were working there, the enemy planes aimed their machine guns at them, killing and injuring several. However, they continued to bravely carry out the work they should do. The girl scouts and female Red Cross team members participating in the rescue work worked hard day and night, providing loyal service. On the other hand, the girl scouts working in the wounded soldiers' hospitals handled everything related to the wounded soldiers every day, writing letters for the wounded soldiers, mending clothes and socks, washing bedding, bandaging wounds, singing patriotic songs, telling patriotic stories, performing patriotic short plays—and so on. They simply made every wounded soldier forget the pain of their wounds and get infinite comfort. As for the girl scouts serving in the refugee shelters, they also wrote letters with the refugees, comforted the elders in their hometowns, and sent the sick to the hospital. The girl scouts had a wealth of common sense about the nutrition of children and the recuperation of mothers, and they were able to deal with them properly. There, whether it was the wounded soldiers or the refugees, or even the general public, seeing the girl scouts' considerate and loyal service, they were all moved to tears. This is direct and deep sympathy for the wounded soldiers and refugees. In other work, such as soliciting winter clothing, the girl scouts set out every day in the alleys of the roads to solicit from the residents, always returning very late, never feeling tired, and each bringing back many winter clothes for the refugees with an excited spirit. Their happiness can also be said to be the seed of every refugee's happiness. This kind of spirit is rarely seen even in foreign countries. It not only shows the patriotic enthusiasm of the girls of the new China, not lagging behind others, but also leads the women of the whole country to surge towards the front line of national salvation like a tide—</p>
<p>Now, in order to make the efficiency of our work even greater, women at the front and in the rear should unite to participate in the following war of resistance work:</p>
<p>(1) To encourage the spirit of the soldiers and relieve their families—We should not only provide medical treatment and comfort to the wounded soldiers, but also provide appropriate relief to their families. We must unite and gather the women in the area to promote the women in all areas to unite to organize comfort groups to investigate the hometowns, addresses, and economic conditions of the families of the fallen soldiers, and earnestly carry out relief matters.</p>
<p>(2) Train the refugees to understand the enemy's brutality! The establishment of refugee shelters is temporary. Sooner or later, the refugees must be sent back to their hometowns. Women's groups should instruct them in the refugee shelters to understand the Japanese imperialists' ambition to invade and lead them to the path of national salvation. When they return to their hometowns, at least they can have a more accurate propaganda effect. At the same time, train them to return to their hometowns to launch various national salvation works.</p>
<p>(3) Participate in production work as much as possible—Under this special long-term war situation, all production undertakings in the war zone are either suspended or destroyed by the enemy. It is impossible to predict how far the war will expand in the future, but most of the men must go to the front line to fight the enemy. Then, all industry and commerce must rely on women to continue working in order to regulate the economy. On the one hand, the government and industrialists should find ways to move industry and commerce to the interior. Our vast number of women have an unshirkable responsibility to rise up and participate in the construction of this national industry. In addition, we should organize various military supply manufacturing plants, such as gas masks, cotton-padded military uniforms, and other woolen fabrics. With our manufacturing plants, we can have a continuous supply. If the strong men in the countryside are either transferred to the front line or sent for training, the women should also take on the task of planting in the fields. At this critical juncture of national crisis, our women should go to factories as much as possible—to military supply manufacturing plants—to the fields!</p>
<p>(4) To relieve out-of-school children—Women must actively carry out relief for out-of-school children under the enemy's artillery fire. For all young children who have escaped from the war zone, we must find ways to give them the opportunity to continue their studies. For the general public, we should also broadly promote literacy education, and we must go deep into the people to universally educate them about all kinds of wartime knowledge in order to avoid unnecessary and unresistant sacrifices. What is especially important is to launch their patriotic enthusiasm in education.</p>
<p>(5) Raise winter clothing and comfort items. When the weather turns cold, the homeless refugees will definitely have no clothes to keep warm. Therefore, women should work like girl scouts, moving and collecting winter clothing and distributing them to the refugee shelters. The second is the collection of comfort items to comfort the soldiers and wounded soldiers on the front line.</p>
<p>(6) Protect mothers and children—Refugee shelters are full of mothers and children. Women should also earnestly organize themselves to engage in the work of nursing mothers and protecting children. Within the possible scope, we should try our best to evacuate children to safe areas to avoid the enemy's destruction. A wartime children's protection association can be organized to take care of them and educate them, because children are the new life of our nation, and everyone should be responsible for their protection. It is most appropriate for women to take on this task.</p>
<p>(7) Engage in small organizations in various roads and alleys—In the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the strength of our morale made the enemy tremble with fear, but we inevitably suffered minor setbacks, mostly because of the actions of traitors. Therefore, eliminating traitors is a very important task. Women should rise up to engage in the organization of various roads and alleys (refer to the second issue of the War of Resistance for methods). For convenience, the following is a brief description in separate articles:</p>
<p>A. Publicize general wartime knowledge.</p>
<p>B. Maintain the security of the neighborhood, such as preventing the activities of traitors and guiding air-raid shelters and poison gas prevention.</p>
<p>C. Tell the day's war news.</p>
<p>D. Advocate frugality, save as much as possible, contribute to the country, and promote the movement of donating money, and persuade the women in the alley to contribute or exchange gold and silver jewelry and utensils for government bonds.</p>
<p>E. Hold neighborhood consumption or production cooperatives.</p>
<p>F. Group together to comfort the wounded soldiers and relieve the refugees.</p>
<p>G. Hold neighborhood kindergartens or primary schools to relieve out-of-school children who have escaped from the war zone.</p>
<p>H. Local propaganda work such as drama broadcasting, singing, lectures, sending reports, and writing reports.</p>
<p>In summary, we hope that female compatriots across the country will unite to build a sound women's national salvation front, launch the above-mentioned anti-Japanese works, and jointly assume the mission of resisting aggression and saving the country.</p>
