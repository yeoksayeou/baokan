<p>專論</p>
<h3>保衛大上海</h3>
<p>從八月十三日開始的對日抗戰，是一個長時期性的戰爭。這戰爭到目前爲止，還不過是一個開頭。可是單是這一個開頭，已經造成了中華民族革命史上一個光榮的紀錄。</p>
<p>在這次全國抗戰中，上海顯然居領導的地位。雖然在八一三以前，華北已有局部的抗戰，可是真正的全國性的抗戰，却是從八一三開始。敵人用陸海空全部武裝進攻的，是上海。我國用最大的人力物力以防衛的也是上海。雖然我們的軍隊，在華北各處前線也顯示了無比的英勇與壯烈的犧牲，但是爲全世界目光所集中，而且具有左右整個戰局的影響的，却無疑地是我們保衛大上海的戰爭。</p>
<p>吳淞　，羅店，蕰藻浜，大塲這幾次戰役，戰鬪的猛烈，比之於歐戰中馬爾納，松納河諸役毫無媿色。可是就我軍將士作戰的勇敢與犧牲的壯烈來說，在歐戰歷史中却找不到先例。在歐戰中無論那一次著名的戰役，雙方的武器是對等的。在上海戰爭中，我們却以陸軍，主要的是步兵隊，來和敵人最精锐的陸海空三軍搏擊。鏖戰兩個半月的結果，敵軍是進展了，但是進展所獲得的陣地有多少呢？離開黃浦江北岸綫不過十餘公里而已。</p>
<p>雖然我們爲了保衛一尺一寸的土地，往往犧牲數千數百的健兒，可是敵人也必須出同樣的或者更大的代價，才能得到這一尺一寸的土地。</p>
<p>單是到目前爲止，大上海一隅的戰事，已經寫下了我民族歷史中萬丈光輝的一頁。創造這光榮記錄的，並不是某部或某軍。這是全國無數地方的部隊的集體創作。雖然參加這英勇戰鬪的，有四川人，有雲南人，有貴州人，有廣東人……有中央軍，有地方軍，有保安隊，有別動隊，……但是在淞滬火線上，已經不再有地方和部隊的分別。現在我們只有一個國軍，爲着國家和民族的利益，而從事保衛大上海的鬪爭。</p>
<p>全國的武裝同志，已經盡了他們最大的責任，而且繼續在盡他們最大的責任，有的時候甚至超過了他們應有的責任。還有未盡的責任應該落在誰的身上呢？自然是在後方民衆的身上，尤其是在特區過着安逸日子這一些民衆的身上。</p>
<p>大上海的市民，大家想一想，在火綫上的武裝同志，是爲了誰拚命，是爲了誰流血，還不是爲了整個民族嗎？我們是不是應該讓武裝同志單獨負荷這重大的犧牲。而我們却躲在特區，過着紙醉金迷的日子？</p>
<p>假如在前綫有一個部隊沒有得到充分的接濟，這是上海市民所應當負責的。有一個傷兵躺在路旁呻吟得不到救護，是上海市民所要問心自媿的。要是五萬萬元的救國公債，不能限期募集，是一切享着安逸生活的人們所應該反躬自責的。</p>
<p>假如在這時候，還要存苟安逸樂的心理，甚至想到對敵人妥洽屈服，甚至以爲有租界的存在，大上海可以放棄，甚至夢想九國公約會議，會給我們一點面子，我們就可以藉此停戰，假如今天還有這種亳無心肝的人，一定要爲全國人民所共棄。蔣委員長領導發動全國的抗戰，而且再三指示我們犧牲到底，抵抗到底。全面抗戰的國策旣定之後，假如還有人懷疑最高領袖，還有人要動搖政府旣定的國策，卽使主觀上不想做漢奸，客觀上是已執行漢奸的任務了。</p>
<p>九國公約會議快要開會了。要提高我國的國際地位，引起友邦的更進一步的同情，我們只有趁這個機會，更堅决地支持全國對日抗戰。而保衛大上海尤其是十分重要的。前綫的壯士，正在作壯烈的犧牲。我們的當局更應該趕快喚醒民衆，解放民衆，領導民衆，動員民衆，使每一個上海市民，都成爲保衛大上海的堅强力量。任憑敵人的武力怎樣雄厚，手段怎樣兇殘，假如我們能夠保衛大上海，到相當長久的時間，國際的同情必然日見增加，敵人勢力必然要被摧毁。大家起來，保衛大上海，再不能有絲毫的怠忽動搖了。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>必須排除的一種錯覺</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>近來有好些人。因爲對於國際援助及軍事勝利。期望得過於殷切的緣故。不免陷入了一種錯覺。以爲民族前途的光明完全憑藉着目前國際的有力援助及軍事的步步勝利。這種心理是非常有害的。因爲方繼萌芽的民族精神。正需要着各個國民堅韌的抗敵意志來培養。而在那一種錯覺之下。一時不利的情勢。就容易使意志消沈下去。影響到民族精神的發榮滋長。</p>
<p>其實國際情勢與軍事情勢是時刻變動的。今天的情勢好。到明天儘可以轉壞。反之。今天的情勢壞。到明天說不定會轉好。祇有我全民族適應着變動中的一切情勢。始終不懈地努力奮鬥。才可以使有利的因素逐漸鞏固。不利的因素逐漸消除。而達到最後勝利的目的。</p>
<p>我們必須竭力排除一切對於民族前途的近視的錯覺。我們必須認清現在還是在抗戰的初期。而抗戰的途程是艱險的。我們不能因軍事上外交上任何一時的挫折。而絲毫鬆懈抗戰的意志。郤須把一切挫折當作刺戟素。來激勵自己加緊地努力奮鬥祇要全民族强韌的抗戰精神繼續着。國際的援助與軍事的成功是不成問題的民族前途的唯一光明就在我全國軍民抗戰到底的决心。</p>

<h3>江灣閘北我軍昨晚西撤</h3>
<p>江灣大塲公路昨被敵軍突破　後路被侵乃作戰略上之撤退　眞如附近刻正激戰中</p>
<p>大隊敵軍、向我猛犯、我軍退出大塲後、公路西側、敵軍仍繼續進犯、直趨眞大公路企圖佔據我眞如車站、我軍應援部隊、已馳往堵截、國際無綫電台附近、仍在猛烈激戰之中、我軍將士、奮勇迎擊、迄午敵軍尚未能到達鐵路綫、今晨拂曉、大隊敵機、當有百數十架之數、在眞如車站附近我軍上空猛烈轟炸、企圖威脅我軍正在作戰之部隊、雖彈下如雨、敵機滿佈天空、我軍將士、絲毫無所畏懼、前仆後繼、仍在猛烈抗戰之中、</p>
<p>敵軍佔據大塲後、滬太公路東面、江灣大塲公路我軍防綫亦被突破、向江灣我軍後路進犯、雖經我軍奮勇抵禦、但以戰略上關係、昨晚午夜起、江灣我軍遂不得不向後作秩序之移撤、同時因江灣之撤退、閘北方面、亦遂陷於極度困難之中、遂同時奉命向京滬鐵路線南面撤退至今午已撤退完竣、我軍撤退時、當將所有防禦工事、盡付一炬、一時火光冲天、黑烟蔽日、敵軍初尚不敢深入、今晨六時後、敵軍方徐徐自靶子路虬江路橫浜橋等處、向北站及寶興路等處衝入閘北、八時以後、恒豐路　光復路·大統路·烏鎭路·各處、已俱發現敵軍踪跡、京滬鐵路綫南面至蘇州河一帶、我軍所築工事、異常堅固、敵如再犯、必難得逞、</p>

<h3>某軍事長官談我撤退閘北原因</h3>
<p>今後敵軍如再進犯　更當耗最大之代價</p>
<p>大公社云、今晨據前綫來此之某軍事要員語大公社記者、我軍自因戰略關係、自動撤退至第二道防綫後、而閘北方面防軍、因地位上過於凸出、易受攻擊、亦於昨晚同時撤退、故今後我方在整個戰略上、自當有新的發展、換句話說、卽敵軍過去所佔之便宜、自此以後、則將完全消去、而我方則能盡量發展抗敵力量、故敵軍欲獲得某某等地、决不可能、雖彼再耗在過去二月餘作戰中較重大之代價、亦徒見其犧牲上之增加、於戰事亦無絲亳有濟於事、今更當聲明者、現我軍雖將閘北一隅放棄、但保護整個大上海之計、則仍始終堅决保守、此實可堪吿於國人之前也、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>大塲廟行閘北等處我們的軍隊已有計劃有秩序的退却了。但是這個退却。用不着什麼懷疑。什麼驚恐。因為這種退却。早在我們意料之中。我們是平面戰。他們是立體戰。他們是用大砲坦克車而戰。我們只用步槍機關槍而戰。機械方面是相差太遠了。但是這樣的戰爭。我們能夠支持到七旬有餘之久。使敵人受到重大的犧牲。相當的代價。不能說是我們抗戰積極的成功。也可以說是消極的勝利。故外報論淞滬戰事。謂不論今後中日戰局如何。中國已獲重大的優點。並非虛語。</p>

<h3>滬戰特寫</h3>
<p>— 中央社隨軍記者王晉琦</p>
<p>二·血戰東林寺</p>
<p>在羅店的西南、離不了三四里地的光景、有一個地形較高、東南北三面環水的東林寺、當時是我們比較最突出的一點陣地、在那裏、守可以瞰視敵人的行動、攻可以截斷敵人的後背、所以敵人侵佔了羅店之後、最不放心下便是東林寺、</p>
<p>從九月十七日開始、敵人不斷的以小部隊行使威力的探索、我們駐守在　裏　一連士兵、把敵人每一次的進犯、都擊退了、到了二十九日的拂曉、敵人出動了大量的兵力、向着東林寺猛烈進犯、一方面是敵人的火力非常猛烈、一方面是敵我的數量衆寡懸殊、我們的陣地、先後被敵人突破了、我們的守兵、一個個掛了彩、甚至一個個倒斃了、可是僅存的幾十個戰士、還留着最後的一滴血、最後的一顆子彈、死守着和敌人拚、這样苦持到快要中午的时候、我们的援軍到了、於是死守着的士兵、做了敢死隊、增援的二連士兵、從左右夾擊、敵人終究不能支持、當天傍晚、敵人完全給我們擊退、</p>
<p>三十日那天、敵人以大小各種砲、施展着面積射擊、把這邊的房屋、都毀壞了、接着步兵衝了過來、雙方的部隊、一步一步的接近、敵人更用密集的機關槍、自動步槍、和小鋼砲、緊對着我們部隊轟擊、我們爲避免過大的犧牲、便向兩旁移動、在這斷垣殘壁的枯廟裏、祇留着三班士兵苦守、架着幾挺輕機關槍等候敵人、</p>
<p>敵人已是一步一步　迫近了這枯廟、我們最後留剩下的忠勇士兵、想摇動機關槍、同敵人拼完了了事、但是在這千鈞一髮的時際、機關槍發生了障碍、大槪是為了射擊過多的原因吧、但是大家仍然很沉着、一些也不着慌、胡玉林班長、囑咐了他的生死相隨的弟兄大家帶足了手溜彈、一聲喊殺、從這斷垣殘壁裏跳了出去　猛烈的向着敵人投去、他自己更英勇地迎上前去、一連投了十餘枚手溜彈、敵人猝不及防、炸死的炸死、炸傷的作傷、其餘的見勢不佳、都狼狽地向後逃去、這時我們的大隊、便又結合起來向敵進擊、敵人急忙回身迎戰、就在田野裏急忙的築着工事、和我對持、敵人雖是迭次敗挫、可是奪取東林寺的　、决不停止、十月一日、敵又用小部隊衝過來、接連幾次都給打了回去、翌日拂曉、敵人的砲又開始轟擊、掩護了敢死隊、蜂擁的衝來、後邊又跟進大隊人馬、我們的部隊、全數出動、向敵人迎擊、經過幾小時的衝鋒肉搏、雙方的死傷、都是很重、</p>
<p>突然間敵人、富田、義信中尉、率領了幾個敵兵、從空隙裏竄進了這殘破的古廟、我們受了傷的胡玉林排長、這時正躺在廟裏、他看見敵人進來、急擧手槍瞄準敵人就打、可是手槍又發生障碍、胡排长急中生智、在他的手旁有一把挖掘戰壕的鐵鍫、他忘却了他的創痛、一躍而起、高舉鐵鍬向敵人砍去、富田義信便做了鍬下之鬼、但是其餘的敵人、還是撲殺進來、班長徐愛山、從廟背轉了過來、看見這樣緊張的局面、便屏住了氣、不作一聲地、從一個敵人的後背、奪得了一把戰刀、揮舞着向敵人沒命的砍將過去、結果了幾個敵兵的性命、在混戰的時候、一等兵劉益刀、被敵人戳中了兩刀、他顧不了身上流着的鮮血、仍舊擧起刺刀、和敵人肉搏、接連刺死了兩個敵人、這樣英勇的搏鬥、把剩下來的三兩個敵人、嚇得魂飛魄散、丟了兵器、拼命逃走、這一塲肉搏、我們雖是受了極大的犧牲、但得了很多的戰利品、使敵人靜伏了幾天、不敢來進犯、</p>

<h3>救亡與求學</h3>
<p>— 郭我力</p>
<p>在民族垂危的時候，我們顧不了本身的一切，耍動向戰鬥的陣綫上去，盡其所有的力量，予打擊者以打擊，挽回民族的危機後，才能談得到自身的問題。</p>
<p>不過，這裏却有一個問題與抗戰有切要關係的，就是“求學”，要解决這件事，目下確是很嚴重而困難的問題。</p>
<p>敵機不顧人道，弁髦國際條約，橫蠻抹理，在我們非軍事設備的文化機構上，恣意轟炸，遍地都遭牠蹂躪了！我們的知識供應的學校，多被破壞得一片瓦礫，這書又從何讀起咧？所以多數靑年斷了知識上的供應。</p>
<p>現在政府當局與敎育界先進，雖努力挽回這刦運，可是失學的靑年，仍不在少數　縱然有些跟着學校遷移到安全境界出了，但，關起門來，唸着死書，彷彿與世隔絶，民族存亡也不關痛　的樣子，確也非任何心之所願？尤其是富於血性的靑年，我相信雖在後方的敎室裏，然內心的沉悶，必有加無已？</p>
<p>發動全面抗戰這固然滿足了我們從“九一八”來一致的渴望，使我們感着無窮的興奮！尤使我們有奮然而起，大家丟掉書本，挺身跑上殺敵陣綫的勇氣和决心。</p>
<p>有人說：“靑年人要努力向學……”靑年人固然不能荒廢學業，而强鄰逼境，已經是深入堂奧，把我們的學校都輪為火塲了·整個民族生命，都在風雨飄搖中，岌岌不可終日！拯救之不暇，還能談到求學的問題上去嗎？可是，知識的飢荒，確也是一件重要的，須使不成為恐怖的事態才好！若求抗戰的勝利，亦就不能忽略這相輔而行的智識問題。</p>
<p>知識是一切事業的發紉，孫子兵法云：“知己知彼，百戰百勝，”學力不夠，又焉能談到“知己知彼？”故“百戰百勝”，也就在夢中了！</p>
<p>這兒我們約略的把究竟怎麽辦來談個大概，前面説過，關起門來讀死書，是沒有用的，而且環境也不可能了，最好是確定，為“抗戰而讀書，為讀書而抗戰，”的觀念，兩者相輔並進，抗戰工作不僅限於火綫，抗戰是不分前綫與後方的，在後方安全境界的，雖泰然置身於課堂裏，也决不能在那兒研究八股式的策論和烏托邦的什麽主義，可要埋頭於各種有關於救亡的學術，（如機械化學，生產技術，防空防毒，醫藥救護等）這才是戰時敎育的最大任務，而且是必盡的職責，因此，我們要把現在後方的學校敎育，變成急追需要的“國防敎育”，把後方的靑年學生，實行勞働化，科學化，軍事化，除凖備直接參與前綫外，其餘要動向生產事業和建設工程上去，已經失學而在前綫和從事後援工作的靑年學生，在努力任務的閒餘，我們更要利用時間之可能，精力之所及，來探求新的知識，决不能就丟閒學業，走入荒廢的一途，求學不定要在學校裏，戰塲和後方工作的塲所以及各社會層，就是我們的敎室與廣大的圖書館，祇要提精會神，隨時隨地，出潛心悉力搜集本身所盡要的材料，以備防知識上的飢荒，才能助長自己抗戰工作的本能，增進救亡的力量。</p>

        <h1>1937.10.27</h1>
<h3>After the Nanda Highway Was Breached by the Enemy, Our Forces Withdrew South from Dachang Temple</h3>
<p>We are actively deploying new defenses, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack.  Enemy forces harassed Zhabei and Jiangwan but were repelled by us.  The enemy attempted to attack Zhenru; fierce fighting occurred at the radio station.</p>
<p>Military intelligence: On the evening of the 24th, enemy forces, using the main force from the Liuhang-Dachang Highway, advanced towards the Tahe Bridge area west of our Dachang position. After a night of intense fighting, the enemy breached our Dachang-Nanxiang Highway defense line by one kilometer, creating a critical situation in Dachang. After nightfall, our troops bravely counterattacked, launching fierce assaults and eliminating many enemy soldiers, at one point driving them back. However, the enemy continued to reinforce in large numbers. By daybreak yesterday, they launched another large-scale attack. Although our troops defended with all their might, all of our fortifications, having been destroyed by the enemy's concentrated artillery fire and continuous bombing by hundreds of aircraft, were not repaired in time, resulting in another breach by the enemy. A large number of enemy troops surged forward like a tide and turned east to attack the left flank of Dachang. Our troops held firm and blocked the attack, while at approximately 9:00 AM, orders were given to the troops stationed at Dachang to withdraw south. Although our troops were determined to defend to the death, due to strategic considerations, they withdrew with tears in their eyes. The Miaohang area, also being too exposed, had to be abandoned simultaneously, with an orderly retreat to the north of Jiangwan. By afternoon, the enemy began to enter Dachang from the northwest. At the same time, they advanced westward along the Dachang-Zhenru Highway, attempting to attack the Zhenru radio station. They were intercepted at the Changbang River, where fierce fighting broke out. The remaining enemy forces were also advancing south. Currently, our front line forms a semicircle from the eastern end of Dachang Town, northeast along the Da(chang)-Zhong(city center) Road, circling north of Jiangwan, extending for one and a half to two kilometers, all the way to the Songhu Railway Station east of Jiangwan. The line from Xiajiangwan to Zhabei remains unchanged. Yesterday, elite troops were dispatched to strengthen the line. At Wangjiazhai, three and a half kilometers west of Dachang, we are also firmly defending the north side of the highway and have deployed a strong defensive line in a diagonal northwest to Aibangtou, about one kilometer east of Xiaonanxiang. South of Dachang, because the enemy had broken through, we deployed a gourd-shaped curve south of Dachang, with the furthest point being Yaojiazhai, about one and a half kilometers south of the highway and about four kilometers from Zhenru.</p>
<p>This newspaper received a frontline report at 2:00 AM this morning stating that after the highway line west of Dachang was breached by the enemy before dawn yesterday, our troops on the Dachang-Miaohang line, being too exposed, had to withdraw south strategically. Starting yesterday morning, the enemy continued to advance south along the Da-Zhen Highway, mobilizing large detachments of infantry and cavalry, with tanks as the vanguard, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launching fierce attacks on our positions west of the Zhenru International Radio Station, attempting to occupy the Zhenru Railway Station and the railway line west of it, cutting off our army's retreat from Jiangwan and Zhabei. Our military authorities, in addition to dispatching elite troops near the Zhenru Radio Station to launch fierce attacks to strictly block the enemy, have also paid close attention to the enemy's conspiracy, determined to prevent them from succeeding. Furthermore, it was learned that fierce fighting, unprecedented in scale, broke out near the Zhenru Radio Station starting yesterday afternoon, with extremely heavy casualties on both sides. As of 3:00 AM this morning, fierce fighting was still ongoing in that area.</p>
<h3>Our Troops' Tearful Withdrawal from Dachang</h3>
<p>Miaohang, being even more exposed, withdrew simultaneously. New defenses were established; a counterattack will be launched with all our strength.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 10:00 PM on the 26th: The reporter safely returned to Zhabei from Dachang this morning. Our troops' tearful withdrawal from Dachang Town was truly unexpected. The fortifications our troops deployed in Dachang were extremely solid, and the determination of the officers and soldiers to fight the enemy to the death was also extremely high. Therefore, the enemy only attempted to advance on the front of Dachang once along the Liuhang-Dachang Highway on the 24th. After being fiercely attacked by our troops, they retreated and concentrated their forces to launch a fierce attack at a point about one kilometer west of Dachang, implementing a strategy of central breakthrough. They used as many as forty or fifty tanks and armored vehicles. The intensity of the attack was unprecedented. Our positions at the Huojiazhai and Taheqiaozhai were successively lost. Then, our fresh troops reinforced and launched a counterattack, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat, killing more than 2,000 enemy soldiers. However, the enemy's will to attack was not diminished by this. Instead, they advanced with even more powerful forces and finally crossed the Zouma Pond. On the 25th, our troops launched another fierce counterattack. A certain division commander took the lead and personally directed operations on the front line. Despite being wounded, he did not retreat. The soldiers became even more invigorated, advancing wave after wave. The intensity of the battle was earth-shattering. The enemy troops were forced back to the edge of the pond, but the enemy's reinforcements arrived continuously, like a surging tide. The firepower of their aircraft and artillery was also incomparable. Although our troops intended to defend to the death, they ultimately could not hold on. At dawn on the 26th, the enemy broke through the Dachang-Nanxiang Highway and advanced to Chenjiameiyuanzhai and Xuzhai. The enemy then turned eastward, heading straight for the rear of our positions from the west side of Dachang. At this point, our troops had no choice but to make a strategic withdrawal. At that time, our troops resisted the advancing enemy with strong units while gradually retreating in good order. At this point, the positions around Miaohang became even more exposed and had to be withdrawn simultaneously. Before 9:00 AM, the withdrawal was completed. Now, our new defensive positions have been established, and a counterattack will be launched with all our strength.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Fierce Fighting Occurred in Two Locations in Jiangwan; Our Troops Counterattacked and Repelled the Enemy</h3>
<p>The enemy harassed us with three infantry companies, without success. We countered from several directions, holding a dominant position and killing over a hundred enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army in Jiangwan reported at 11:30 PM on the 26th: Starting at 2:00 PM, multiple enemy tanks appeared on Tiyu Hui Road, advancing in formation, covering three companies of infantry, attacking our position. Our machine gun teams and artillery teams fired fiercely, causing the enemy to be startled and stop, but they still lingered and continued to harass us. At dusk, our troops launched a counterattack, killing more than fifty enemy sentries. Around 7:00 PM, the enemy finally retreated. From the Zhishe University to Fangjia Muqiao along Shuidian Road, Liuying Road, and Guangzhong Road, there was also intense fighting starting at 3:00 PM. The enemy attacked from the direction of the 63 Huayuan Patriotic Girls' School, with intense firepower. Our troops countered from several directions, holding a dominant position. By around 6:30 PM, the enemy was repelled, with approximately ninety enemy soldiers killed or wounded.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army in Zhabei reported at 12:20 PM on the 26th: In Zhabei, around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, over three hundred enemy soldiers were active in the Beisichuan Road area, using flat-trajectory guns from tanks loaded with incendiary bombs to bombard us from time to time. Several civilian houses in the area caught fire from the strikes. Our troops, knowing the enemy was attacking, immediately responded with fierce fire from various intersections such as Dongbaoxing Road and Guangdong Street. For a time, fierce street fighting broke out, lasting until around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, when the enemy troops were unable to sustain the fight and retreated. In this battle, more than forty enemy soldiers were killed, and four light machine guns were captured.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army in Jiangwan reported at 12:20 PM on the 26th: Our troops in the Zhishe University and Baziqiao areas launched a night attack around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, charging past Tongji Road and attacking the enemy in the 63 Huayuan area. The enemy used machine guns and flat-trajectory guns to create a wall of fire, preventing our advance. However, our troops fearlessly charged forward. After closing in on the enemy, in addition to throwing hand grenades at the enemy, they also used light machine guns to fire at the enemy, eliminating many enemy soldiers. Our troops retreated back to their original positions after dawn.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Again Used Poison Gas Shells on the South Bank of the Yunzaobang</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 26th reported that enemy forces have been fiercely attacking the area along the south bank of the Yunzaobang for days, but have been repeatedly thwarted by our troops' courageous resistance. Therefore, the enemy disregarded international law and, in desperation, released poison gas to hinder our advance. It is reported that several of our soldiers have been poisoned.</p>
<h3>Our Artillery Killed the Enemy Artillery Regiment Commander, Itta</h3>
<p>Over forty artillerymen died.</p>
<p>On the night of the 22nd of this month, Itta, the artillery regiment commander of the enemy's 11th Division in the Yunzaobang area, was hit by artillery fire from our artillery positions, suffering severe injuries. At the same time, over forty enemy artillerymen in the area were all killed. After being wounded, Itta was transported by the enemy to the enemy wounded soldiers hospital on Miller Road in Hongkou.

<h3>The Enemy's Attack on Guangfu Was Repelled by Us</h3>
<p>The artillery battle was fierce the night before; the enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army in Guangfu reported at 10:15 AM on the 26th that the enemy forces in the Guangfu area have been attacking for days, but have been bravely repelled by our troops. However, the enemy has not given up. From the night before to yesterday morning, they launched another fierce attack. Our troops calmly responded, completely routing most of the enemy forces. Only a small portion of the enemy is still engaged in scattered fighting north of Guangfu.</p>
<p>A fierce artillery battle unfolded in the Guangfu area starting at 10:00 PM the night before. According to a report from the military authorities, the enemy initially began to concentrate artillery fire at 9:30 PM, bombarding our positions in Guangfu. Our troops initially ignored it, but the enemy's artillery fire became increasingly dense, so our ×× artillery positions responded with heavy artillery fire. It became even more intense by 12:30 AM, with the sound of artillery clearly audible within a five-kilometer radius. The two sides exchanged fire until after 2:00 AM yesterday morning. It is estimated that the enemy fired no fewer than a thousand shells. Our side returned fire with four hundred shells. However, the enemy's artillery fire was indiscriminate, so our side was not significantly affected. On the contrary, the shells fired by our artillerymen were extremely accurate, and the enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Infantry in Luodian Did Not Dare to Fight</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 25th reported that the enemy bombarded our Xiang Gong Temple positions all day on the 24th without stopping. However, the infantry never dared to approach us. On the morning of the 25th, several enemy aircraft flew back and forth over our positions, reconnoitering, and two tanks were active, but their infantry still did not appear.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Destroyed an Enemy Ordnance Depot</h3>
<p>And destroyed multiple enemy aircraft at the Yangshupu enemy airfield.</p>
<p>At 0:50 AM yesterday morning, when our brave air force came to Shanghai for the second time to bomb enemy positions, they dropped a bomb on an enemy gasoline and munitions depot on Huade Road and Beikai'er Road. An explosion immediately occurred, and the enemy's supplies there were completely destroyed. The gasoline also caught fire and burned until approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, still not extinguished. In addition, the enemy airfield at the bottom of Yangshupu was also hit by a bomb. It is reported that multiple enemy aircraft were destroyed.</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reported that on Sunday afternoon, Chinese aircraft appeared in the skies over the Shanghai area for the first time in daylight. Several fighters engaged Japanese aircraft at very high altitude. According to witnesses, two aircraft fought fiercely for a long time and then flew off in different directions. Two Chinese fighters were also seen diving to attack Japanese bombers and then ascending to extreme altitude, disappearing from sight. Neither side had any aircraft shot down, so there was no significant result in this engagement.</p>
<p>Our air force came to Shanghai again last night to assist in the fighting, passing over the Huangpu River four times at 10:50 PM, 0:25 AM, 1:10 AM, and 2:15 AM this morning. Enemy ships were extremely alarmed, frantically searching with searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns fired immediately, as if strung together like beads. However, our aircraft passed safely. Each time, the sound of artillery fire lasted about two or three minutes and then stopped.</p>
<h3>After Enemy Aircraft Killed a British Soldier, the British Army Implemented Defensive Measures</h3>
<p>The British government awaits a complete report. Anti-aircraft guns were installed on Kaixuan Road.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from London on the 25th, Havas: Regarding the case of a unit of the British defense forces in Shanghai being attacked by Japanese aircraft, resulting in one soldier being killed by a bullet, the British government has not yet received a complete report and has not decided what attitude to adopt. However, according to general predictions, the government will present the following demands to the Japanese government: (1) a formal apology; (2) compensation for damages; (3) punishment of those responsible; and (4) a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. It is expected that Japan will comply with these demands, including apologizing and punishing those responsible.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Invade and Open Fire</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based *North-China Daily News* reported that the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Phillips, and the Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, Little, personally visited the Commander of the British Garrison in Shanghai, General Smalley, on the 24th to express their condolences. The Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Yarnell, also visited General Smalley on the 26th to express condolences and sorrow. British Consul-General Phillips recently informed Japanese Consul-General Okamoto, expressing concern about the Japanese aircraft attack on British civilians on Kaixuan Road and requesting that various measures be taken to avoid similar incidents. Furthermore, the British military authorities informed the Japanese authorities on the 25th that in the future, whenever Japanese aircraft attack British military defense locations, British soldiers will open fire in response. Anti-aircraft guns have now been installed at British military defense locations on Kaixuan Road for defense purposes. The National Maritime News Agency's London dispatch on the 26th stated that the local newspapers paid close attention to the news that the British garrison in Shanghai had been ordered to open fire on any Japanese aircraft attacking the public concession. The *Daily Express* reported that three Japanese aircraft flew over the public concession yesterday and were fired upon by British sentries. This is the first time British troops have opened fire on Japanese aircraft since the Sino-Japanese incident occurred.</p>
<p>MacGowan's Funeral Was Solemn</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that the funeral for MacGowan, the British soldier killed by Japanese aircraft with machine gun fire on Sunday, was held at the Jing'an Temple Road Cemetery yesterday (Sunday). The ceremony was grand, rarely seen in Shanghai. Representatives of the armies and navies of all countries stationed in Shanghai, except Japan, led their teams to the ceremony to pay their respects. Among them were the commanders-in-chief of the British, American, French, and Chinese navies, as well as consular officials and representatives of various organizations and groups in the city. The deceased was Irish and a Catholic, so the ceremony was presided over by a Catholic chaplain from the British defense forces. As the chaplain was sprinkling holy water on the coffin amidst the swirling incense, the sound of aircraft in the sky broke the surrounding silence. Three Japanese aircraft were flying to the western district of Shanghai to carry out their bombing operations. The British military authorities requested that British citizens no longer ride horses on Kaixuan Road after the incident there, but some people still rode horses on that road yesterday. It was reported that some of them were among those who had encountered danger the day before.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Has Formally Apologized</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from London on the 26th, Havas: Regarding the case of Japanese aircraft killing British soldier MacGowan in Shanghai, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota recently sent a note to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, for transmission to the British government. The note stated, "It has been found that several Japanese military aircraft accidentally killed a soldier of your country on Kaixuan Road in Shanghai on the 24th of this month. This minister hereby formally apologizes to your Excellency the Ambassador in the name of the Japanese government. The Japanese government will impose appropriate punishment on those responsible after completing the investigation and is prepared to provide necessary compensation for the losses suffered by the citizens of your country." The British government is currently studying this note and may issue a statement on this note when the House of Commons meets this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Map of the War Zone Near Dachang and Nanxiang</h3>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Continue to Wreak Havoc</h3>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, over a dozen enemy aircraft circled and dropped bombs over Zhabei at the intersection of the Huta Highway and Zhongshan Road, as well as Tanzi Bay. Another group circled over Hengfeng Road, Datong Road, and Gonghe Xin Road, flying over the Suzhou River and the Xinzha Bridge, dropping a bundle of silver powder as large as a dou. At this time, the southeast wind was very strong, and the aforementioned powder entered the river and was blown away by the wind, flying towards the rooftops of Zhabei. The sky was filled with smoke. At 2:30 PM, enemy aircraft again dropped bombs, which landed at the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Zhongshan Road, near the Maigen Road East Station, in Chaomibang (i.e., Xujiazhai), on Yongxing Xiaomal Road, on Zhongxing Road North, at the intersection of Huiwen Road and Zhiyuan Road, and on Hongxing Road, Hongxingfang, etc. At 4:35 PM, another enemy aircraft dropped twelve bombs, eight of which landed at the Dayang Bridge on Jiaotong Road and near the Capital Temple on Zhongxing Road West, and four of which landed between Datong Road and Haichang Road (i.e., the original site of the Xinzha Police Branch Office). The houses in that area immediately caught fire, and the fire was very intense. Starting at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy aircraft bombed the Maigen Road Station area. Enemy aircraft also reconnoitered and dropped bombs over the highway between Dachang and Zhenru. One place between the Maigen Road East Station and the Guangzhao Mountain Villa caught fire due to the bombing.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>In Pudong, three enemy aircraft circled at various locations yesterday morning, primarily for reconnaissance purposes. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, six light bombing aircraft formed two groups and flew south one after another. Their destination is unknown. At 3:00 PM, two more reconnaissance aircraft came and circled over the Zhangjialou and Jinjiaxiang areas for a long time without leaving. At 5:30 PM in the evening, three heavy bombers flew from the Zhabei area and dropped six heavy bombs successively in the countryside east of Qianjiaxiang. The extent of the damage is pending investigation.</p>
<p>The Jinjiaxiang Catholic Church in Pudong has been bombed three times by enemy aircraft in recent days. More than ten bombs have been dropped. All the new and old halls, priests' bedrooms, and classrooms for male and female students in the church have been completely destroyed. The extent of the damage is even greater than that of the Zhangjialou Catholic Church.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Is Building Underground Ordnance Depots on Jungong Road</h3>
<p>To avoid the threat of our artillery fire from Pudong.</p>
<p>The docks and warehouses of Osaka, Huangpu, and Huishan in the Eastern Shanghai District originally stored a large amount of enemy munitions. In recent days, because the various artillery shells fired from our artillery positions in Pudong have often hit key enemy targets, in order to avoid our threat, in addition to having previously moved important explosives to the Yufeng Cotton Mill, in recent days, the enemy has also built multiple important underground ordnance depots along the Jiangyan section of Jungong Road from Shanghai University to Zhanghuabang, moving most of the munitions originally stored at the Huangpu, Huishan, and Osaka docks to that location. The munitions shipped to Shanghai in recent days, if unloaded at internal docks, are immediately transported to the front lines. The rest are mostly unloaded at the Qiujiang Wharf and Zhanghuabang Wharf.</p>
<p>The Enemy Has Also Shipped In Six Heavy Cannons</p>
<p>The enemy has shipped in six 40mm heavy cannons, as well as more than ten smaller-caliber cannons, and deployed them in the Jilin Road and Huishan Park area. It is reported that they are preparing to attack our Pudong and Zhabei areas.</p>
<p>On the 24th, the enemy transport ship Ma'anshan Maru and others arrived at the Osaka Wharf from Sasebo with a large number of munitions from the Huangpu Wharf. On that day, enemy military trucks transported some of them to the front lines for use. The remaining supplies and a small number of bullets had not been transported away as of 11:00 AM yesterday and were mostly covered with canvas to prevent attacks by our land and air forces. Multiple enemy soldiers were stationed in the adjacent warehouses. At the same time, over ten enemy soldiers were rushing to install cranes at the wharf to be used for unloading heavy military equipment.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that at approximately 6:00 AM yesterday morning (the 26th), the enemy merchant ship Fengguang Maru, converted into a transport ship, sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf, carrying over a thousand boxes of munitions. After arriving at the wharf, unloading onto the shore began immediately.</p>
<p>The Enemy Secretly Installs Floating Docks in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Gonghexiang Wharf currently has dozens of specially made floating docks and buoy beacons for rivers, all painted red and freshly painted. They were recently transported from Japan on the enemy transport ship Guangde Maru on the 24th. It is reported that starting today, two enemy steamers will separately transport them to the Huangpu River and Wusong area for installation to facilitate the nighttime passage and mooring of enemy ships.</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Wounded Soldiers Transported Back Home</p>
<p>At approximately 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the enemy merchant ship Haruna Maru (No. 380), converted into a Red Cross ship, sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Wharf, continuing to transport over a thousand wounded enemy soldiers back to Japan. The severity of enemy casualties can be seen from the continuous arrival of their Red Cross ships in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Temple Military Supplies Transferred</p>
<p>The troops stationed at the Japanese temple on Zhapu Road (commander: Kuinohara Ichi) and all of their munitions were transferred to the Nakao Village Printing Factory on Haibin Road on the 22nd. Currently, a military supply transport office has been established in the Japanese temple, with Chokuda Choshirō as the director. A large number of military supplies still remain in the temple.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military Authorities Order Japanese Residents to Return Home</h3>
<p>Due to Difficulties in Supplying Food</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Suzhou on the 25th reported that since the start of the Shanghai War, the food for the Japanese residents remaining in Shanghai has been controlled by the Japanese Navy. Currently, because the Shanghai War has not achieved the Japanese military's goal of a quick victory, the supply of food has become very difficult. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities have ordered all Japanese residents remaining in Shanghai who are not involved in military or political affairs to return home. These Japanese residents have been in Shanghai for many years and have considerable assets. It is reported that their painstakingly managed businesses have been destroyed by the Japanese military's actions, so they deeply resent the military's acts of aggression.</p>
<h3>The German Ambassador Visited Kawagoe Yesterday</h3>
<p>The German Military Attaché Stationed in Tokyo Inspects Japanese Front Lines</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that the German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, visited the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, at his residence on Bixun Road at 11:00 AM yesterday (Sunday) and held a lengthy meeting. The nature of the conversation is unknown. At the same time, Major General Walter, the military attaché of the German Embassy in Tokyo, arrived in Shanghai from Japan last Friday and inspected the Japanese front lines in the Songhu area yesterday.</p>
<h3>Two Major British Newspapers Discuss the Songhu Battle</h3>
<p>Regardless of the Future Course of the War, China Has Gained Significant Advantages</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from London on the 26th, Reuters: Regarding the battle in Shanghai, the *Manchester Guardian* published an editorial today stating that regardless of the future course of the war in Shanghai, China can be said to have gained significant advantages. The Japanese currently have approximately 120,000 troops participating in the battle in Shanghai, which is actually the force that is indispensable for the war in North China. In terms of losses, both China and Japan have suffered extremely significant losses. The difference is that China can afford it, while Japan cannot. The Japanese military should blame itself for its impatience, which has led to this unnecessary sacrifice on a stage outside the main one. Furthermore, *The Times* reported today that the hospital equipment in the war zone, the lack of supplies, and the incompleteness of the organization in Shanghai are worse than in any other country in the world. Therefore, every British family should remember the appeal of the Mayor of London when preparing to buy Christmas gifts.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Bombard Kinmen</h3>
<p>Enemy's Attempt to Land Unclear, Our Security Forces Suffer Heavy Casualties, Xiamen-Kinmen Traffic Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>[Xiamen] Enemy warships bombarded Kinmen around 4 a.m. on the 26th, firing over forty shells. At dawn, three warships sailed into Houbu Port, launching three inflatable boats and four sampans, carrying soldiers towards Shuitou and Tong'an wharves to attack. Our security forces and local militia bravely resisted. The enemy's attempt to land is still unclear. At 5 p.m., an enemy plane scouted the Wutong Aotou area in the northern suburbs of Xiamen and then flew away. In the morning, enemy planes dropped six bombs in the southern suburbs, all landing in the fields, only injuring a grass-cutting woman. Otherwise, there was no damage. In the afternoon, many Kinmen residents escaped to Xiamen by sailboat. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xiamen] The enemy's attempt to invade Kinmen on the 24th was unsuccessful. On the 25th, nine more warships arrived outside Xiamen Port, making a total of eleven ships including the original two destroyers. At around 4 a.m. on the 26th, eight ships bombarded Kinmen, and simultaneously attacked the mouth of Xiamen Port. Xiamen's fortress returned fire, firing over twenty shells, driving the enemy back. At 9 a.m., an enemy plane flew over the southern suburbs of Xiamen, back and forth for an hour and a half, dropping four bombs in the fortress area. There were three air raid alerts. At 10:40, the enemy plane was approximately 30 miles away. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xiamen] When enemy marines attempted to land on Kinmen at 7 a.m. on the 26th, two aircraft provided bombing cover. Our county security forces and local militia resisted, suffering heroic sacrifices. Since then, the situation has been unclear. The county government has moved its offices to Dadan Island. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Enemy's Two-Pronged Attack on Taiyuan Thwarted</h3>
<p>Our Reinforcements Arrive and Recapture Guangling, Toihara's Troops Retreat North of the Zhang River, Enemy Main Force on the Jinpu Line Near Ling County</p>
<p>[Beiping] The Japanese army advancing towards Taiyuan is currently encountering fierce resistance in the mountains of Xinkou and Niangziguan. A Japanese army spokesman claimed today that small units of Japanese soldiers have occupied a position inside Niangziguan, but Chinese troops are encircling and attacking from the mountains south and north of the pass, hindering the Japanese advance. Guerrilla warfare is also constantly underway. Simultaneously, Chinese troops in the Xinkou mountains have launched a vigorous counterattack in an attempt to repel the Japanese army. (26th Central News Agency/Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Since our army occupied Guangling, the enemy felt threatened in the rear. Starting on the 23rd, they led a large army to attack Guangling, attempting to retake the area. A battle for control ensued. Our army bravely defended, and after three days of intense fighting, the enemy sent reinforcements. Our forces, outnumbered, temporarily withdrew from the city. On the 25th, our reinforcements arrived and immediately counterattacked the enemy, retaking Guangling. In this battle, hundreds of enemy soldiers were killed and many guns and cannons were seized. The remaining enemy soldiers fled towards Yuxian. The enemy in Lingqiu is also escaping towards Hunyuan. We are currently pursuing them on different routes. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] In recent days, our armies on various routes in northern Shanxi have achieved repeated victories, and morale is extremely high. The enemy army has suffered heavy blows in its advance. Moreover, their rear has been cut off by us, making resupply difficult. The soldiers are weary of battle and their spirit is completely depleted. It is expected that the war in northern Shanxi will have new developments within days. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] On the 25th, a portion of the enemy army in eastern Shanxi retreated. According to information gathered on the 26th, this move by the enemy clearly indicates other plans. Our side has taken precautions. Enemy troops south of Jiuguan are still stubbornly resisting. There have been intense battles on both the 25th and 26th. However, because it is difficult for enemy artillery and tanks to move in the mountains, they can only fight on foot, which allows us to demonstrate our strengths. Moreover, with the addition of our fresh troops to the battle, morale has been boosted. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Our troops dispatched from Yanmen Pass are currently facing off against over a thousand enemy soldiers near Heishitougou. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Our army previously destroyed 22 enemy aircraft with outstanding courage and resourcefulness. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a special order to commend them. The original telegram stated, in brief: "Commander Liu's division and Colonel Chen's regiment launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield, destroying 22 enemy aircraft, demonstrating remarkable resourcefulness and courage. This is extremely commendable. In addition to being referred to the Ministry of Military Affairs for deliberation and reward, this telegram is sent first to commend them." (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sources received a telegram from Taiyuan on the 25th stating: 1. A detachment of our army attacked the enemy in Wangcun near Pingshan, capturing 22 horses, destroying 4 vehicles, and seizing several rifles. The enemy suffered over 30 casualties. 2. On the evening of the 21st, a unit of our troops blocked the enemy's transportation route between Fanxian and Yangmingbao, encountering over 30 enemy vehicles fully loaded with infantry heading towards Fanxian.

<p>[Taiyuan] A telegram received here today from the ××× Army reported that a column of the army ambushed a Japanese outpost on the Datong-Yanmen Pass highway, destroying five bridges and inflicting significant damage on the Japanese transportation line. The report also stated that as a result of the transportation line being in a precarious state, the Japanese were experiencing a growing shortage of artillery shells. As a result, 100 cannons are currently being moved from the front line back to Daixian, the second transportation line, to prevent them from being intercepted by the Chinese army. As for the 22 aircraft damaged at Yangmingbao, the Japanese are still unable to transport them to the rear for repairs, so the Japanese air force is rarely seen in action. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The cities of Guangling and Lingqiu and the villages between them have all been destroyed by enemy artillery fire, and thousands of civilians have been massacred. The situation is extremely tragic. The people's hatred is deeply ingrained, further increasing their anti-Japanese sentiment. They are actively joining the war effort, launching attacks to destroy transportation. Currently, the roads between Lingqiu and Guangling, Datong, and Pingxingguan Tuanchengkou have been destroyed. They cannot be opened to traffic without extensive repairs. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Enemy Aircraft Repeatedly Attack the Capital, Gaining Little and Losing Much</h3>
<p>Our Losses are Very Minor, The Enemy Wastes Ammunition and Gasoline</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to estimates by foreign experts, since the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai War, the Japanese army has dropped approximately 1,200 bombs on the capital alone. However, the damage suffered is extremely minor because the Japanese planes' aim is inaccurate and they fly too high. The bombs range from 500 to 750 pounds, and 10% of them do not explode upon impact. Although half of the total number of bombs targeted ××××, the above two areas were not damaged. The only damage was to the power plant's Fangpeng. According to the opinions of several foreign military observers today, the losses suffered by Nanjing due to the Japanese planes' bombing are far less than the cost of the bombs dropped by the Japanese army and the two million yuan worth of gasoline required to fly to Nanjing. It is truly a losing proposition. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Qingshan and Ziyue form a large circle, silent and still beneath our feet. All is quiet and still. This is the air raid in Nanjing. No one dares to move. Everything is quiet and disciplined. Residents throughout the city are hiding in air raid shelters. Only a few air defense soldiers are scattered on the peaks of the hills, gazing at the blue sky with telescopes. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Secretary-General of the Aviation Commission, is here, preparing to conduct an on-site survey of the bombed areas, busy tallying the losses in order to provide relief to the victims. There, officers are directing their men to work. News reporters and photographers are also on the rocks, risking their lives for sensational shots. Above, the sky is blue, so blue it cannot be bluer. Gray clouds are stacked in piles, and the autumn sun shines like gold on the ground. Two teams of airmen are engaged in a fierce dogfight in the air. China's brave eagles are fighting fiercely against Japanese heavy bombers and fighters to protect the capital. Falling bombs unleash terrifying explosions. Anti-aircraft guns spit out regular, short, sharp howls. There are also successive, grinding machine gun sounds. The planes dive straight down. Everyone is making a life-or-death decision, but every movement is so elegant and far away, as if these horrors are not real. The air forces of both sides chase each other between the gray clouds, forming rings in the glittering sunlight, surrounding each other. The eagles triumph, and the enemy planes retreat. Watching them pursue, what happened to this one? Why is it rolling? It did not agree with them. Chinese planes are opening fire on it. It does not pursue anyone, it rolls and rolls again, accelerating, making a beautiful, large circle, flying into the clouds and flying out again... many circles... five, six, seven... After flying for a long time, the circle is still completely motionless, chasing the enemy relentlessly. Finally, where are the Japanese planes... gone, they must have fled... The next day, a plane was found crashing into a mountain, with seventeen bullets piercing its fuselage. Before his death, he knew that the god of death was coming. He chased after the god of death, surrounding the enemy, safely all the way. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hubei High Court Tries Yang Assassination Case</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The Hubei High Court opened the trial of the Yang assassination case at 9 a.m. on the 26th. Xiong Renchang presided as the presiding judge. Cheng Fen Chao, Xi Baizhou, Cao Bingrong, Liu Luyin, Yang Qixin, Nie Jingquan, and Wen Maoguan were questioned separately. Tang Shuren, the prosecutor of the Wuchang District Court, explained why he disagreed with the original verdict. When Cheng Gong was cross-examined, he was stopped from speaking for a time because he roared and cursed. Liu Luyin explained his anti-Japanese stance, saying that although he approved the expenses for the Revolutionary Corps, it was not established, and its purpose was to resist Japan, not the central government, so the assassination of Yang had nothing to do with it. Cheng Xi's lawyer, Lin Hengyuan, defended him, saying that Cheng's purpose was to eliminate traitors for anti-Japanese purposes, which stemmed from patriotic enthusiasm, and that Xi especially had no evidence of murder. He requested a reduced sentence. Liu Luyin's lawyers, Wang Zhaoxiang and Zhang Guoen, severely refuted the original judgment, saying that it violated the facts, the law, the teachings of the ancients, and national policy in four points: Anti-Japanese elimination of traitors is absolutely unrelated to assassination. The word "即" (i.e.) in the original judgment's "eliminating traitors is i.e. assassination" is even more arbitrary than the baseless accusations of Mo Xu You. At a time when the war of resistance against Japan is underway, Liu is still imprisoned for resisting Japan, which is truly incomprehensible. They requested that he be acquitted. Xie Shengkan, a representative of Yang's family, requested compensation of 110,000 yuan. Finally, the presiding judge concluded the debate, and a verdict will be announced within a week. The court was adjourned for a time. It is rumored that a verdict will be announced on the 27th. It is generally speculated that the original verdict will be upheld. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Vice President Kong Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Minister of Finance Kong arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai this afternoon. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by car at 5 a.m. on the 26th. He made a statement to reporters from the Central News Agency, briefly saying that the entire nation is united in resisting Japan, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advances. During his time abroad, his conversations with people from all walks of life in various countries have all expressed sympathy for our country and condemned Japan's atrocities. He hopes that both the front and rear will work even harder to win the final victory. As for financial and monetary issues, the central government has long planned effective measures. Enemy aircraft are wantonly bombing our capital, but our people and civil servants remain calm and work tirelessly, which is deeply admirable. Kong then rushed to the Executive Yuan to preside over a meeting. After the meeting, he also met with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and Chairman Wang to report on matters.

<h3>Japanese Plot to Rob and Steal Stamp Printing Plates</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reliable sources, Japanese soldiers in Beiping, in the name of the so-called "Advisors of the Beiping Maintenance Association," forcibly took 50,000 yuan worth of our country's stamps from the Beiping Postal Administration. They are also searching for the printing plates used to print various stamps in order to freely print stamps. Because the printing plates have always been kept by Tao Majiefu (Russian), the Postal Administration's resident stamp printing supervisor in Beiping, they have repeatedly forced him to truthfully reveal their location and warned Tao not to leave the country, otherwise he would be subjected to the most severe punishment. Tao replied that the printing plates were sent to the Postal Administration in early August of this year and have not been in his custody since. At about 5 p.m. on October 23rd, six men wearing police uniforms suddenly came to Tao Majiefu's home, kidnapped Tao and took him away. His whereabouts are unknown. The Beiping postal authorities are currently trying to rescue him. The Japanese army's various atrocities in Beiping are too numerous to record. Now, they have even arrested postal personnel, plotting to rob and steal stamp printing plates in order to freely print stamps and secretly sell them in various parts of our country for profit, which is truly despicable and shameless.

<h3>Enemy Attempts to Land at Yanglinkou</h3>

<h3>Enemy Rampantly Conscripts Within the Country</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to Jinan News, because the number of soldiers in the three-year service period is insufficient, the Japanese have now issued an order that all men aged 18 to 50 who are not in the three-year service period must serve in the national temporary military service. The severity of the enemy's casualties and their exhaustion in coping with rampant conscription can be seen from this. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Our authorities have warned all foreign ships that if they are followed by Japanese warships when sailing to the outer Humen, they must immediately stop and retreat to avoid Japanese warships taking advantage of the foreign ships as cover to sneak into the Pearl River. We will not be responsible for any losses incurred if these warnings are not heeded. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference Postponed to November 3rd</h3>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Refuse Participation, Geneva Expresses Doubt About the Conference's Future</p>
<p>[Brussels] Due to changes in the Belgian cabinet, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has now been postponed from October 30th to November 3rd. (Central News Agency 26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Because a cabinet crisis has occurred in the Belgian government, it has inquired of the British government whether the Nine-Power Conference can be postponed to November 3rd. Although the British government is willing to hold the conference on October 30th as originally planned, it has complied with the Belgian government's request to avoid embarrassing the Belgian government. An official announcement will be made as soon as the relevant powers agree to the postponement. (Central News Agency 26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is rumored that this morning's Japanese cabinet meeting decided not to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels. After it is submitted to the Emperor for approval, a reply will be sent to the Belgian government. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] All Japanese newspapers expressed sympathy for the Japanese government's decision not to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels. Organizations that explicitly expressed opposition to Japan's participation in the conference included the Association of Members of the House of Representatives and the Association of Retired Civil and Military Officials. The Association of Retired Civil and Military Officials passed a resolution stating that Japan's military operations in China are purely for self-defense and do not violate the Nine-Power Treaty or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It also stated that interference by third countries would only cause disputes in the overall situation. (Central News Agency 26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, after the adjournment of the League of Nations Assembly, the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Issue was entrusted to pay attention to the evolution of the conflict between China and Japan. Subsequently, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference decided to convene a meeting in Brussels on the 30th of this month, so the Advisory Committee also scheduled to meet here at the end of this month. Today, the governments of the countries participating in the Advisory Committee received a notice from the Secretariat of the League of Nations stating that the original meeting date of the Advisory Committee should be postponed, and the meeting will be rescheduled after the results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are clear. As for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it will not be convened before the 3rd of next month. (Central News Agency 26th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Diplomatic circles here studying news from various capitals mostly expressed skepticism today about the Nine-Power Treaty Conference's hope for restoring peace in the Far East. The reasons are: 1. Japan still harbors the delusion of defeating China's resistance forces. 2. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States cannot jointly restrain Japan. 3. The United Kingdom and France are too preoccupied with the serious situation in the Mediterranean to attend to other matters. It is understood that after the meeting of eighteen countries on Saturday, Russia and Germany will be invited to participate. The meeting will then be postponed until Tuesday of next week to await the arrival of the representatives of the two countries. The strongest point for China at this meeting is that the Nine-Power Treaty originally guaranteed China's territorial integrity. Participants should not propose to split China. Furthermore, China can ultimately submit the entire issue to the League of Nations, making it impossible for the United Kingdom and France to evade their responsibilities.

<h3>British King Addresses Parliament, Expressing Concern Over Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Determined to Cooperate with All Nations to Seek Restoration of Peace</p>
<p>[London] Today, Parliament reconvened. The King and Queen attended to deliver the address. People thronged the streets to Westminster Abbey to witness the ceremony. This was the first convocation of Parliament personally attended by the King since his accession. Parliament Square was packed with people, and crowds also gathered in front of Buckingham Palace. Members of the Royal Family and nobility attended the Upper House in full ceremonial dress. The grandeur of the ceremony was second only to the coronation. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain was unable to attend due to a bout of gout.</p>
<p>The King's speech stated: "I have invited the King of Belgium to visit Britain in November of this year, and the King of Romania has been invited to visit next spring. At that time, I will extend a grand welcome to them, to further strengthen international friendship. My ministers are increasingly concerned about the war in Spain, and intend to make every effort to bring peace to the people of Spain. They firmly believe that the strict implementation of the international non-intervention policy will greatly contribute to peace. Furthermore, the events in the Far East will continue to receive the close attention of my government. My ministers will work in cooperation with other nations, whether or not they are members of the League of Nations, to reduce the suffering caused by the war. I also eagerly desire to personally visit my Indian Empire in the future." The King further stated that Britain's national defense construction is progressing rapidly, and that legislation will be introduced to seek protection for civilians against air raids. The King also said that the situation in commerce and industry is excellent, and that the progress made last year can certainly be maintained this year.

<h3>American Peace Groups Support Government's Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>[Washington] The National Peace Conference, composed of forty groups, today wrote to Secretary of State Hull, endorsing the government's participation in the Nine-Power Conference, stating that condemning war or isolating military aggression is not sufficient to achieve practical results. Economic and political justice is the only foundation for rebuilding lasting peace. We believe that the United States should cooperate with the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to initiate steps towards economic adjustments to improve the living standards of all nations.

<h3>British Times Expresses Sympathy for China</h3>
<p>Brutal Atrocities of the Japanese Are Unbearable, Calls on British People to Donate for Relief</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the relief of wounded soldiers and civilians in the Chinese war zone, The Times has again published an article calling on the British people to donate generously. In addition to depicting the tragic situation on the Shanghai front lines, it also stated that the situation in various cities in the Chinese interior affected by the war is particularly pitiful. The cities and towns in the Chinese interior are densely populated, and sanitation facilities are often lacking. For example, in the area along the Pinghan Railway in Hebei Province, which is currently under bombardment, and in the province of Chahar, which is already experiencing wind and snow, the soldiers huddled in trenches and non-combatants everywhere have no knowledge of relief and epidemic prevention, and their suffering can be imagined. Fortunately, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Broadbridge, has stepped forward to raise funds. Our sympathy for the wounded soldiers and civilians in China can thus be expressed in a tangible way. All our citizens are urged to respond enthusiastically and contribute generously to this righteous cause. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoys in Europe Convene Meeting in Brussels</h3>

<h3>Japan's New Wartime Budget</h3>
<p>Expanding Military Expenditures for the Invasion of China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government's budget for the next fiscal year is currently under review by the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. According to the opinion of the top officials of the Ministry of Finance, the budget for the next fiscal year, including the special account for temporary military expenditures, will be prepared as a wartime budget. (1) The temporary military expenditure (China Incident expenses) will be prepared under the policy of acquiring and supplying military supplies in order to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>(2) A proactive approach will be adopted for rear-area work such as military relief, assisting wounded soldiers, and introducing soldiers to occupations. Furthermore, in view of the current situation, consideration will be given to defense expenditures other than temporary military expenditures. Wartime fiscal and economic policies will be implemented. When imbalances occur in various sectors of the domestic economy, they will be compensated for by taxes or other policies.</p>
<p>(3) New expenditures in general and special accounts must be severely reviewed, and efforts will be made to save expenses in accordance with the wartime budget preparation policy. (Domei News dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>Abundance of Aluminum in Japanese Mandated Islands</h3>
<p>Essential for the Munitions Industry</p>
<p>[San Francisco] According to a report published today by the Pacific International Relations Research Association, the League of Nations mandated territories of Yap and other islands now under Japanese rule contain extremely rich deposits of bauxite. Bauxite is the raw material from which aluminum is derived, so it is of great help to Japan's munitions industry. According to a survey conducted by Mitsui &amp; Co. in Yap and other places, there are at least 5 million tons of aluminum there. Active mining is now planned, and it is estimated that 50,000 to 60,000 tons of aluminum can be obtained each year. Therefore, Japan can expect to be self-sufficient in aluminum raw materials and need not worry about the sanctions of others. (National News dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Janson Announces Reasons for Resignation, Former Finance Minister to Succeed in Forming Cabinet</p>
<p>[Brussels] Following a cabinet meeting this afternoon, a communiqué was issued stating that Prime Minister Janson has decided to resign, and all cabinet members will resign with the Prime Minister, and have submitted their resignations. Prime Minister Janson then went to the palace to meet with King Leopold III to submit his resignation. Subsequently, at 8:00 p.m. in the evening, he delivered a radio broadcast to the nation, explaining the process of his resignation, stating: "In recent months, the national unity cabinet has been in a very difficult situation. The elements that once supported the cabinet now make things difficult for it. At the same time, my political enemies have used all kinds of base and despicable means to spread rumors and slander throughout the country, even saying that I am involved in the National Bank's corruption case. Although I am innocent of such allegations, I cannot remain silent and refuse to defend myself. Therefore, I have decided to resign from the position of Prime Minister to restore my freedom of action in order to present a defense." In conclusion, he said: "In the current turbulent atmosphere, I cannot continue to serve as Prime Minister. Under these circumstances, the government can hardly succeed." Janson succeeded the Theunis cabinet on March 25, 1935, and formed the first cabinet. Due to domestic economic difficulties, currency devaluation had to be implemented. He resigned after the parliamentary elections in June 1936, and was appointed by the King to form the second cabinet, which has continued until today. The majority party in the House of Representatives that supports the government has approximately 140 members, including 70 Socialists, 60 Catholics, and approximately 20 Liberals. The opposition party has approximately 70 members. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>[Brussels] It is rumored that the new cabinet will still be a national unity cabinet, and will be formed by a member of the Socialist Party. It is almost certain that Finance Minister De Man will serve as the new Prime Minister. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>French Air Station on Spanish Minorca Island Attacked by Air</h3>
<p>Paris Greatly Shocked by the News, Mediterranean Situation Turns Serious</p>
<p>[Voies, France] After the French ship "L'Aetmela" was sunk yesterday by an unidentified seaplane, the French air route base in Fornells, Minorca Island, was bombed today by seaplanes painted with black crosses of unknown nationality. French personnel were greatly shocked by the repeated attacks on their interests in the Mediterranean. Several bombs hit a ship repairing aircraft at the air base, causing a fire, but no one was injured. A French destroyer has now sailed to Fornells to protect the safety of the Marseille-Algiers route. At the same time, the French authorities have ordered an investigation into the sinking of the "L'Aetmela" in order to determine the nationality of the attackers. After the investigation report, the French government will decide on the measures it will take. The captain of the "L'Aetmela" and 22 crew members told a Reuters reporter upon arriving in Port Vendres on a French destroyer that the ship was flying the French flag and had the national emblem painted on the deck, but it was still attacked. The attackers were two seaplanes with black crosses painted on their wings. The ship was carrying miscellaneous grains from Morocco to Port Vendres. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] According to information received here, aircraft belonging to the Spanish Nationalist forces dropped manifestos in the style of Aedemton over the Spanish island of Minorca in the Mediterranean (now in the hands of the government forces), demanding that the island surrender to the Nationalist forces. In addition, a small boat belonging to Air France was sunk today in the port of Fornells, Minorca Island, by an aircraft of unknown nationality. British diplomatic circles were very disturbed by the news, and believed that if the Spanish Nationalist forces attacked Minorca Island, the situation in the Mediterranean would become extremely serious. However, British military experts said that the fortifications of Minorca Island are known to be strong, and that if the Nationalist forces attack the island, it would cause diplomatic disputes. Therefore, General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist forces government, may not rashly attack the island. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<h3>Non-Intervention Committee Likely to Grind to a Halt</h3>
<p>Italy and Russia Refuse to Concede</p>
<p>[Rome] Because Italy and the Soviet Union have both declared their positions on Friday of last week and are unwilling to concede, the meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee are likely to grind to a complete halt after today. Italy is in favor of the entire plan declared by Britain in July, one section of which stated that the two sides in the Spanish war should recognize that they have the rights of belligerents at sea. This section has been unanimously welcomed in Italian public opinion circles. The Italian representative, Grandi, insisted that the representatives of all countries should unanimously approve this British plan. However, the Soviet representative stated that the Soviet Union is unwilling to grant the rights of belligerent groups to both sides before the volunteer soldiers are completely withdrawn. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] It is rumored that the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, has stated to British Foreign Secretary Eden that the Soviet Union is unwilling to pay any further expenses to maintain the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish conflict, because the entire mechanism of the Non-Intervention Committee only covers up a completely different situation. It is also rumored that the Soviet Union may consider withdrawing from the Non-Intervention Committee meeting today or in the future at an appropriate time. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<h3>US Designing and Building Anti-Aircraft Ships</h3>
<p>The Only Effective Weapon in Naval Warfare</p>
<p>[Washington] American naval experts are now planning to build a type of anti-aircraft ship to defend against air force attacks. The hull of this warship is approximately 600 feet long, with a flat deck, similar to an aircraft carrier. At least 25 anti-aircraft guns will be installed on each side of the deck, for a total of at least 50 anti-aircraft guns per ship. Naval experts believe that by using this dense anti-aircraft fire to simultaneously deal with the attacking air force, an extremely dense fire net can be formed to shoot down enemy aircraft in large numbers. At present, each of the US Navy's main battleships is only equipped with four anti-aircraft guns. If twelve main battleships are concentrated in one place, there would still be only 48 anti-aircraft guns. Therefore, concentrating all of the main battleships at one point would not provide as much defensive power against air force attacks as a single anti-aircraft ship. Since the 48 anti-aircraft guns are distributed on twelve warships, it is impossible to achieve a high degree of coordination in their operation. Furthermore, since there are no other superstructures on the deck of this warship, its anti-aircraft guns can operate freely within a 260-degree angle, facing the enemy on all sides without restriction. Therefore, it can be used for high-angle fire to deal with aircraft, and also for indirect fire and direct fire to deal with the enemy's destroyers. However, this anti-aircraft ship is still in the design stage, and its actual construction is still pending. (National News dispatch from the 25th)</p>

From major cities to overseas Chinese scattered in rural areas, all are generously donating to fundraising organizations and remitting funds to the Far East. The Chinatown in San Francisco alone has donated 500,000 US dollars. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>Defending Greater Shanghai</h3>
<p>The resistance war against Japan, which began on August 13th, is a long-term war. This war is, so far, just a beginning. But even this beginning has created a glorious record in the revolutionary history of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>In this national war of resistance, Shanghai clearly occupies a leading position. Although there was already a local war of resistance in North China before August 13th, the real national war of resistance started on August 13th. Shanghai was attacked by the enemy with all its land, sea, and air forces. Shanghai was also defended by our country with the greatest manpower and material resources. Although our troops have also shown unparalleled bravery and magnificent sacrifice on the front lines in various places in North China, the war to defend Greater Shanghai is undoubtedly the one that has been focused on by the world's attention and has an impact on the entire war situation.</p>
<p>The battles of Wusong, Luodian, Yunzaobang, and Dachang were as fierce as the battles of Marna and the Songhua River in the European war. However, in terms of the bravery and magnificent sacrifice of our soldiers, no precedent can be found in European war history. In any famous battle in the European war, the weapons on both sides were equal. In the Shanghai war, we used the army, mainly infantry, to fight against the enemy's most elite land, sea, and air forces. As a result of two and a half months of fierce fighting, the enemy has made progress, but how much territory has this progress gained? It is only more than ten kilometers away from the north bank of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Although we often sacrifice thousands and hundreds of strong men to defend every inch of land, the enemy must also pay the same or even greater price to obtain this inch of land.</p>
<p>So far, the battle in the corner of Greater Shanghai has written a page of immense glory in the history of our nation. The creation of this glorious record is not the work of a certain unit or army. It is the collective creation of troops from countless places across the country. Although the participants in this heroic battle include people from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong... There are the Central Army, the local army, the security team, the special operations team... But on the Shanghai front line, there is no longer a distinction between places and troops. Now we only have one national army, fighting to defend Greater Shanghai for the benefit of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>Armed comrades across the country have fulfilled their greatest responsibility, and continue to fulfill their greatest responsibility, sometimes even exceeding their due responsibility. Who else should bear the unfulfilled responsibility? Naturally, it falls on the people in the rear, especially those people who live a comfortable life in the special zone.</p>
<p>Citizens of Greater Shanghai, everyone think about it, who are the armed comrades on the front line fighting for, who are they shedding blood for, isn't it for the entire nation? Should we let armed comrades bear this great sacrifice alone? And we hide in the special zone, living a decadent life?</p>
<p>If a unit on the front line does not receive sufficient supplies, this is the responsibility of the citizens of Shanghai. If a wounded soldier lies groaning on the side of the road and cannot get help, it is the Shanghai citizens who should ask themselves whether they are ashamed. If the 500 million yuan of national salvation bonds cannot be raised within the time limit, it is the people who enjoy a comfortable life who should reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>If at this time, we still want to maintain a mentality of complacency and pleasure, and even think about reaching a compromise and surrender to the enemy, and even think that with the existence of the concession, Greater Shanghai can be abandoned, and even dream that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will give us a little face, so that we can use this to stop the war, if there are still people who have no heart and liver, they will definitely be abandoned by the people of the whole country. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the launch of the national war of resistance, and repeatedly instructed us to sacrifice to the end and resist to the end. After the national policy of all-out war of resistance has been established, if there are still people who doubt the supreme leader, and there are still people who want to shake the established national policy of the government, even if they do not want to be traitors subjectively, they have objectively carried out the task of traitors.</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is about to open. To improve our country's international status and arouse further sympathy from friendly countries, we can only take this opportunity to more firmly support the national war of resistance against Japan. And defending Greater Shanghai is especially important. The brave men on the front line are making magnificent sacrifices. Our authorities should quickly awaken the people, liberate the people, lead the people, and mobilize the people, so that every citizen of Shanghai becomes a strong force for defending Greater Shanghai. No matter how strong the enemy's military force is and how cruel its methods are, if we can defend Greater Shanghai for a considerable period of time, international sympathy will inevitably increase day by day, and the enemy's power will inevitably be destroyed. Everyone, get up and defend Greater Shanghai, there can be no more slightest negligence or hesitation.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Sports Circles Organize Salvation Association</h3>
<p>The Municipal Sports Salvation Association Sends Telegrams to Overseas Chinese in Various Countries</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Sports Circles Salvation Association has actively promoted its work, the registration of sports organizations has been very enthusiastic in recent days. In addition to holding a sports symposium on a regular basis to discuss progress, there is now a possibility of expanding and establishing a national association. According to the preparatory office of the association, they recently received a letter from comrades in the Hong Kong sports circles, expressing their deep sympathy for the organization of the association and adopting a unified action, and immediately organizing the Hong Kong Sports Circles Salvation Association, in order to echo each other and establish a glorious foundation for our sports circles. The original letter and the telegram sent by the association to overseas Chinese in various places are translated as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from Hong Kong Sports Circles</p>
<p>Respectfully, it is reported that your association, for the sake of national salvation and survival, has launched the great fearless spirit of our sports circles and resolutely organized the Sports Circles Salvation Association. We admire your vision and are deeply impressed by your plans. We believe that sports are an essential plan for the revival of the nation. Although the government spends huge sums of money every year, the promotion and support have never stopped slightly. Recently, when the national crisis is imminent, it is time for our sports circles to work hard to strengthen the country and serve the country. How can we be silent and suddenly announce a suspension? Fortunately, your association has been established, regardless of whether it is a beacon of hope, and it shines brightly for our sports circles. We can see that the future development is unlimited. We and other colleagues are humble sports practitioners in Hong Kong. How can our patriotic enthusiasm lag behind others? We have discussed and organized the Hong Kong Sports Circles Salvation Association, in order to follow the leaders of your association and work together on salvation work, so as not to betray our national duty. We respectfully send a short letter, hoping that you will show us your organizational outline and various regulations, so that we can follow them. Sincerely, the Hong Kong Sports Circles Salvation Association Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>Telegram to Overseas Chinese in Various Countries</p>
<p>To the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Student Association in various countries through the Ambassadors of the Republic of China: Since the Japanese invaders have invaded our territory and the motherland has been in distress, fortunately, all our comrades across the country have been united in hatred and vowed to resist the war to the death. The final victory is not far off. We have learned that the British League of Nations Association has proposed to refuse to participate in the World Games to be held in Tokyo in 1940. The whole country is gratified. Since the beginning of the organization of our association, in addition to inviting the National Sports Association to petition the sports authorities of various countries to respond, we have always admired your association's love for the motherland and concern for our homeland. We dare to ask you to lead overseas Chinese to work hard and strive to obtain the unanimous sympathy of the sports circles of friendly countries in the shortest possible time, so as to achieve the goal of canceling the qualifications of the Japanese Empire as a member of the Olympic World Games. The telegram is urgent and we are looking forward to it.</p>
<h3>Mr. Luo Yiwen Discusses the Situation of Shanghai's Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Strict Discipline Maintained, Hospital Order Excellent. Anxious to Recuperate, Eager to Kill the Enemy. However, Material Still Lacking, Hope for Donations from All Sectors.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th battle, our loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting bravely on the front lines, eliminating stubborn enemies. The daily lives of wounded officers and soldiers are of great concern to the people. This reporter specially interviewed Mr. Luo Yiwen, Director of the Shanghai Wounded Soldiers Management Committee and Director of the General Affairs Department. He said that since the outbreak of the August 13th incident, leaders from all walks of life in the city have risen up and established dozens of rescue hospitals. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Rescue Committee, they have taken in wounded soldiers and engaged in large-scale</p>
<p>Rescue and Healing</p>
<p>work. Towards the end of August, Mr. Yan Fuqing, Xu Guanqun, Wang Kui-sheng, Yu Songyun, Guo Qiyuan, Wu Liguo, and other gentlemen in charge of rescue work, realizing that the management of wounded soldiers should have a strict and sound organization and unified methods, began to prepare for the Wounded Soldiers Management Committee. On September 1st, representatives from the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Administration, the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, and various participating troops and related parties in Shanghai, formally established the committee. Relying on the sincere guidance of the responsible leaders and the enthusiastic cooperation of the hospital authorities, the work has been progressing smoothly. The committee's expenses are all allocated by relevant groups in Shanghai. However, all staff members, from the director to the office staff, are</p>
<p>Serving Voluntarily</p>
<p>working hard and not shying away from hardship. Their spirit is truly admirable. The committee is organized by three members, who mutually elect one director to preside over daily affairs. Under the director, there are three departments: General Affairs, Management, and慰劳(comforting). Each department is divided into groups. Since its establishment, the committee has processed ××× soldiers who have recovered and returned to their units, and ××× soldiers with minor injuries who have been transferred to the rear. We inspect the rescue hospitals every day and are deeply impressed by the medical leaders' emphasis on wounded soldiers as national treasures and the seriousness of the rescue work, which has changed the old concept of 轻武 (disregarding military affairs) in the past. All doctors, nurses, boy scouts, etc., do not fear hardship or pressure, and do their best to serve under the minimum living conditions. They all contribute their abilities, engage in rescue work, and take increasing the strength of the war of resistance as their sole aim. The development of this spirit of service is truly the most valuable foundation for the overall war of resistance, and it is also a great progress for the Chinese people. All the wounded officers and soldiers are scattered in hospitals. Thanks to the hospital directors' serious work and perfect equipment, they are able to</p>
<p>Abide by Discipline</p>
<p>obey hospital regulations, and recuperate peacefully. There are very few disputes. Even though they are wounded in battle, they are never arrogant because of their merits. Their high level of awareness and strong morale show that all the soldiers deeply understand the great significance of this war of resistance. Therefore, from their sickbeds, one can often hear shouts of "Kill the enemy!" As soon as they recover, they all ask to return to their units and continue to fight bravely. This firm determination to kill the enemy is the characteristic of our new soldiers. Some soldiers want to return to their units even before they are fully recovered. Their spirit of generously sacrificing themselves for justice is especially the military soul of the Chinese nation's rejuvenation. In order to improve work efficiency, the committee often sends staff to inspect various hospitals to ensure that they are as perfect as possible within the possible range. Larger hospitals are assigned special personnel to be stationed in the hospitals to assist the authorities in management and慰劳 (comforting). Although the committee's various measures have not been able to proceed as we initially envisioned due to financial constraints, fortunately, in the past fifty-odd days, with the enthusiastic assistance of all sectors of society and the hard work of our colleagues, we have been able to advance smoothly. Currently, the most difficult issues to deal with are</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>and contacting some returning units. However, colleagues do not slacken their efforts due to difficulties. They must do their best to find solutions. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will provide assistance from time to time. There are many aspects to the work in the future that need to be carried out urgently, such as investigating the exact number of casualties since the Shanghai battle, rushing to produce a list of the total number of wounded officers and soldiers received by various rescue hospitals in Shanghai, and the number of deaths in the hospitals. As for the wounded soldiers in the hospitals, since the Shanghai慰劳 (comforting) Committee has sent staff to be stationed in various hospitals to handle慰劳 (comforting) matters, we still hope that leaders from all walks of life will give them further encouragement in spirit. In addition, as it is now late autumn, there is a great need for quilts, cotton clothing, trousers, rubber shoes, socks, and gloves. We also hope that all sectors will provide assistance so that they can be distributed to those who have recovered and returned to their units or those who have been transferred to the rear with minor injuries.</p>
<h3>The Pawn Broking Industry in the Special Zone Donates Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Pieces</p>
<p>The pawn broking industry in the Shanghai Special Zone, considering the hard work of the soldiers on the front lines who are bravely fighting the enemy and defending the country, and the urgent need for warm clothing as the weather turns cold, sent 1,360 yuan in national currency to the local協(cooperation) Association on the 26th of this month, asking them to make 2,000 cotton vests and forward them to the front lines.</p>
<h3>Lili Company Serves as Agent for慰劳 (comforting) Cotton Goods</h3>
<p>Since the start of the war, soldiers at the front lines have bravely fought the enemy and repeatedly annihilated Japanese pirates. Good news has spread, and the whole country is encouraged. Now that the weather is getting colder, the front lines urgently need a large number of cotton clothes to keep warm. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will donate. It is learned that Lili Company at 762 Jing'an Temple Road has brought in a large batch of new cotton and is very willing to act as an agent for various sectors on a voluntary basis. They also have ready-made cotton vests, general's quilts, cotton-padded jackets and trousers, and white cotton quilt batting, etc., priced low, which should satisfy various sectors.</p>
<h3>First Announcement of National Salvation Bonds in the Business Community</h3>
<p>Total Subscriptions of 16.9 Million, Over 8.08 Million Yuan Already Paid</p>

It is reported that the team held a meeting at 5 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Secretary-General Luo Qinghua, to discuss plans for further active progress, and the amount of the second announcement of results is expected to increase even more.</p>

<p>The He Brothers Donate Property</p>
<p>Central Committee member He Shizhen has always been enthusiastic about public welfare and founded Chizhi University to cultivate talents for the country, which has already made a great contribution. This time, the Shanghai battle occurred, and the school happened to be in the war zone, suffering great losses. However, Mr. He is still unwilling to lag behind others in national affairs. He has now specifically sought the consent of his brothers, Shi Mo, Shi Kai, and Shi Mei, to donate all the property in Tao Wu Town, Nanjing, consisting of 411.4 mu of land and 400 shi of rented rice, to purchase national salvation bonds. All nine land deeds have been transferred by the Solicitation Headquarters to the Nanjing Branch for sale and valuation. He Shimo has also separately donated 500 shi of rented rice in Anhui to purchase bonds, which will also be handled by the headquarters through the Anhui Branch. A letter was sent to Mr. He expressing admiration. The He brothers can be called brothers in adversity.</p>
<p>Young Writer Subscribes for One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Young writer Yan Chonglou has provided much assistance to慰劳 (comforting) and relief matters since the outbreak of the Songhu War of Resistance. He has now subscribed to 100 yuan of national salvation bonds. According to Mr. Yan, although writers' lives are often hard, they should also do their best to contribute wealth. At this time of deep crisis, the work of saving the country must be expressed in deeds.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Orders Elementary Schools to Adopt the National Salvation Bond Picture Book</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau, upon receiving a picture book on national salvation bonds submitted by the Commercial Press, reviewed it and considered it to be rich in content and accurate in its ideas, and suitable for elementary school students as supplementary reading material. Yesterday, it specially ordered all public and private elementary schools in the city to adopt it as one, in order to promote it and achieve significant results. The original text of the order is as follows: According to the Commercial Press's submission, since the brutal Japanese invasion of our country, in order to save the nation and survive, we have launched a comprehensive and sustained war of resistance and issued national salvation bonds to concentrate financial and material resources to strengthen national defense. All Chinese people should be united against the enemy and enthusiastically subscribe. However, the significance of this move is great and still needs to be widely publicized. The National Salvation Bond Fundraising Committee has recognized this and compiled a picture book of national salvation bonds for teaching in elementary schools. The content is substantial and can inspire elementary school students to develop anti-enemy enthusiasm and deeply cultivate a patriotic spirit after reading it. It is now entrusted to our library for publication by the committee. We enclose two copies of the sample. We respectfully ask for review and permission to order all elementary schools under your jurisdiction to adopt it as one, as a necessary supplementary reading material for elementary schools, which is truly beneficial, etc. Accordingly, it is ordered that all schools must adopt it as necessary. This order, Director Pan Gongzhan, October of the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Women's慰劳 (comforting) Association Raised a Large Batch of慰劳 (comforting) Goods</h3>
<p>Divided into 400 Packages and Shipped to Shanghai, Telephoned Mrs. Kong to Distribute to Various Places</p>
<p>Mrs. Kong, the Vice-President's wife, previously considered that the relief work for wounded soldiers and refugees was extremely important during the war, and specifically proposed organizing the Hong Kong Women's慰劳 (comforting) Association to lead the women's circles in Guangdong to engage in work nearby. Since its establishment, it has been very active in慰劳 (comforting) and relief work. Recently, it has raised a large batch of慰劳 (comforting) goods from various parties, including cotton vests, cotton clothing, rubber shoes, flashlights, underwear,万金油(medicinal ointment), towels, cotton, gauze, silk ribbons, cotton balls, etc., which were divided into more than 400 packages and shipped to Shanghai by the Taikoo Steamship Company's Guangdong ship a few days ago. The association telegraphed Mrs. Kong to send someone to collect them and distribute them nearby based on the urgency of the needs of various disaster areas and wounded soldiers' hospitals. After receiving the telegram, Mrs. Kong immediately sent someone to retrieve them and carefully distribute them to various places. It is reported that the batch of慰劳 (comforting) goods also included more than 100 pieces of慰劳 (comforting) goods raised by the New Transport Association and the Hong Kong War Disaster Relief Association, which were also transported to Shanghai by the association.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>A Misconception That Must Be Dispelled</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Recently, many people have fallen into a misconception because they have excessively high expectations for international assistance and military victories. They believe that the bright future of the nation depends entirely on the current powerful international assistance and the gradual military victories. This mentality is very harmful because the nascent national spirit needs to be cultivated by the tenacious will of every citizen to resist the enemy. Under that misconception, temporary unfavorable situations can easily depress the will and affect the growth of the national spirit.</p>
<p>In fact, international situations and military situations are constantly changing. Today's situation is good, but it can turn bad tomorrow. Conversely, today's situation is bad, but it may turn good tomorrow. Only when our entire nation adapts to all situations in the midst of change and strives tirelessly can we gradually consolidate favorable factors, gradually eliminate unfavorable factors, and achieve the ultimate goal of victory.</p>
<p>We must do our best to eliminate all shortsighted misconceptions about the nation's future. We must recognize that we are still in the early stages of the war of resistance and that the path of resistance is difficult. We cannot relax our will to resist the enemy in the slightest because of any temporary setbacks in military or diplomatic affairs. Instead, we must treat all setbacks as stimuli to encourage ourselves to work harder. As long as the strong national spirit of resistance continues, international assistance and military success are not a problem. The only bright future for the nation lies in the determination of our entire army and people to resist to the end.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Enemy Association Formulates Propaganda Strategies for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Expressing Solemn Demands, All Sectors Acting in Unison, the Municipal Education Association Cables All Countries to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association believes that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is of great importance and the people should express their views on it. After several meetings of international propaganda personnel from various groups to discuss unified propaganda methods, and at 4 p.m. yesterday, experts on international issues were invited to hold a symposium to discuss in detail and carefully formulate a "Propaganda Strategy for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference," which was distributed to various groups and newspapers to carry out in unison in accordance with this strategy. It was also decided to convene an emergency meeting of representatives from various groups in the city to issue an important declaration expressing solemn demands. The following is an excerpt from the propaganda strategy issued by the association:</p>
<p>(A) Theoretical Principles ① The Nine-Power Treaty Conference should absolutely maintain the spirit of the treaty and implement the purpose of the treaty. ② The participating countries in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should absolutely assume the obligations they should have under the treaty. ③ The convening of the Nine-Power Treaty is to resolve the issue of breach of contract, so any resolution should adhere to the dignified position of the treaty. ④ The breaching country should be held legally responsible and given practical sanctions.</p>
<p>(B) Our Demands ① Japan's violation of the treaty and aggression against China have been proven by the League of Nations. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference should take the same action as the League of Nations and declare Japan an aggressor and a breaching country. ② In accordance with the spirit of Article 1 of the treaty, China's sovereignty, independence, territorial and administrative integrity must be restored. Under this principle, Japan should be ordered to fulfill its obligations under the treaty. At a minimum, it should be done within a time limit: 1. Withdraw all naval, land and air forces in China back to Japan; 2. Abolish all pseudo-organizations that undermine China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity. ③ In accordance with the spirit of Article 2 of the treaty, any international treaty or agreement that violates the principles of Article 1 of the treaty should be declared invalid. ④ If the breaching country does not strictly implement all the above resolutions to uphold the treaty, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, promptly impose collective and effective sanctions. The sanctions include: (1) Cutting off diplomatic, commercial, and financial relations with Japan. If it is still ineffective, then take (2) using force to stop Japan's acts of aggression. ⑤ China is resisting the aggressor to uphold the treaty. The participating countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and the member states of the League of Nations should provide practical assistance, such as supplying military supplies and raw materials, not prohibiting their citizens from participating in the Chinese army, and similar actions. ⑥ In order to implement the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty and achieve its purpose, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should expand the original treaty or expand it into a general collective security treaty for the Pacific, which should add: 1. Mutual assistance clauses; 2. Sanction clauses; 3. Provisions for the establishment of permanent supervision and enforcement agencies; 4. The signatory countries should include all countries in East Asia or the Pacific with relevant interests. ⑦ Request the government to issue an important declaration expressing solemn demands (omitted below).</p>
<p>(C) Our Attitude If various countries propose mediation, we should express the following attitudes: ① If various countries strictly maintain the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty and come out to mediate, and the proposed measures do not harm China's independence, sovereignty, territorial and administrative integrity, our country can accept it. ② If various countries do not intend to strictly enforce Japan to fulfill the Nine-Power Treaty, but base themselves on the established facts and propose a compromise mediation method, which causes damage to China's independence, sovereignty, and territorial and administrative integrity, then our country should resolutely reject this kind of mediation (omitted below).</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association telegraphed the Nine-Power Conference and the three representatives Gu, Guo, and Qian, saying: ① To the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels: Our association believes that the Japanese army's invasion of our country is barbaric and unreasonable. Therefore, we cable the peace-loving Nine-Power Treaty Conference to call for help. Since Japan forcibly occupied our Northeast Provinces, it has advanced to massively increase troops in Tianjin, destroying the Boxer Protocol. On July 8, a conflict broke out between the garrison troops in Lugou Bridge. We were deceived by the Japanese army's false peace, and the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Suiyuan were all invaded by the Japanese army. On August 13, Japan used the incident of Japanese sailors at the Hongqiao Airport in our country's economic center of Shanghai to launch a major war. Afterwards, the Japanese army implemented its inhuman actions as much as possible. Major cities across the country, such as Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Hangzhou, as well as railway stations along the railway, were mostly bombed. Hospitals, cultural institutions, the elderly, young, women, and children were all tragically massacred. Even worse, they bombed and shot at the Red Cross rescue teams and even third-country diplomats. This kind of perverse action, even in formal warfare, is a major violation of international law and is intolerable to world peace and humanity. Moreover, Japan has not yet formally declared war on our country. Now that the Nine-Power Conference is about to open, we urge all peace-loving participating countries to uphold justice, never give any accommodation to the aggressor, and resolutely take united action to deal with this barbaric aggressor. The Shanghai Education Association and the Shanghai District Education Associations respectfully greet you. ② To the three representatives Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, and Qian Tai in Brussels: Since the outbreak of our country's comprehensive war of resistance, the international community has seen you winning on the diplomatic stage, and the world is sympathetic. Now that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is about to be held in Brussels, we deeply hope that you will continue to work hard to ensure that this conference accurately determines that Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, so that when the League of Nations Conference reopens, it can be further proposed to impose economic sanctions on Japan and provide assistance to our country. The Shanghai Education Association and the Shanghai District Education Associations respectfully greet you.</p>
<h3>Huang Juyin Executed by Shooting Yesterday for Embezzlement of Donations at Asia Sound Radio Station</h3>
<p>Hampering the Work of Saving the Nation, Disturbing the Rear, Punished According to Wartime Military Law to Serve as a Warning</p>
<p>Commander Yang Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Huang Juyin of the Asia Sound Radio Station in this city was accused of embezzling donations. He was handed over by the police bureau to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation on the 11th of this month. Commander Yang attached great importance to this case and ordered the military law department to handle it quickly. The department presented a request to appoint Judge Xi to investigate the case. The investigation was completed yesterday, and it was determined that Huang Juyin had indeed embezzled a large sum of money. Commander Yang immediately approved an order for him to be executed by shooting on the same day. The execution was carried out yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m. next to the Chen Ying Shi Pagoda in Ximen, which greatly pleased the people. The following is a record of the proclamation:</p>
<p>▲Proclamation of the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Proclamation of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, Law No. 262, states: Huang Juyin of the Asia Sound Radio Station, under the pretext of raising donations to help wounded soldiers and refugees, embezzled a large sum of money. After investigation by this headquarters, the allegations were found to be true. His actions are seriously harmful to the work of raising donations to save the nation. Disturbing the rear in this way is truly hateful. In accordance with the provisions of the second half of Article 9 of the Wartime Military Law of the Republic of China and Article 1 of the Implementing Regulations of the same law, he is sentenced to death. The defendant will be verified, bound to the execution ground, and executed by shooting to serve as a warning. In addition to reporting it, this is a proclamation for general knowledge. This proclamation includes: the executed criminal Huang Juyin, 33 years old, from Nanhui, Republic of China, October 26, 26th year.</p>
<p>▲Commander Yang Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Regarding this case, Commander Yang made a statement to reporters yesterday, saying: Huang's actions originally constituted the common crime of embezzlement. However, at a time when patriotic people are advocating donations to save the country, they are embezzled by unscrupulous people. Although this does not hinder their patriotic enthusiasm, hatred of villains is something everyone feels. Moreover, in the midst of a comprehensive war of resistance, soldiers on the front lines are fighting desperately with their blood. Support from the rear is not only a duty that citizens should fulfill, but also something driven by conscience. However, Huang has lost his conscience to this extent. His actions clearly disturb the rear. According to wartime military law, he should be punished with execution to apologize to all the citizens and to make unscrupulous people aware of the warning. I know that after this severe punishment, patriotic people will be more enthusiastic in donating money, and the prospects for the work of donating money to save the nation will be smoother. The Asia Sound Radio Station issues temporary receipts for donations, which are handed to the donors. In addition to reporting to the radio station, the donations, along with the stubs of the receipts, are sent to the receiving organization to issue official receipts. The radio station then notifies the donors to bring the temporary receipts to exchange them. If this can be done conscientiously, there is nothing wrong with it. However, Huang Juyin took advantage of the psychology of the citizens who did not always exchange for official receipts, and actually embezzled a portion of the donations. It was not until someone went to exchange the temporary receipts for the official receipts of the receiving organization and found nothing that it was discovered. According to Huang's confession, he donated a total of about 39,000 yuan. Only over 25,000 yuan of official receipts have been retrieved from the various receiving organizations. The remaining over 9,000 yuan includes over 5,300 yuan that had already been discovered because Huang had not submitted the money and could not obtain official receipts, resulting in donors being unable to exchange for them with their temporary receipts. The rest were embezzled by Huang et al. There is also a sum of 4,000 yuan that is also unaccounted for. If Huang's confession of the amount donated is not false, then those holding temporary receipts have not yet come forward to negotiate, so it has not been discovered. In total, the amount embezzled by Huang et al. is over 9,000 yuan, but the receipts for gold and silver items without numbers, or without records of their color, purity, and weight, which were embezzled by him, are not included. Currently, in addition to taking the 2,000 yuan that Huang had in the Bank of China and a car (said to have been bought for 750 yuan), negotiating for their return and converting them into compensation, the remaining amount should still be recovered separately according to law to replenish the donation funds. I have one thought: After this case was handled by this headquarters, although many letters were received from donors every day, out of the over 25,000 yuan of official receipts that the radio station had retrieved, over 18,000 yuan had not been exchanged by the donors even after the Broadcasting Industry Association published a notice in the newspaper. Although this is due to the donors' temporary carelessness, thinking that the donations came from patriotism and not caring about other things, abandoning the responsibility of supervision allows unscrupulous people to take advantage of weaknesses to engage in fraud, which is also regrettable. I hope that in the future, donors will pay attention to supervision at any time, so that the purpose of all the donated funds is clear, and there will be fewer disputes. As for the handling of this case, because the case was complicated, the investigation and calculation of accounts took time. After two weeks, the case was closed, and the Broadcasting Industry Association's tireless efforts to assist the government are also commendable.</p>
<h3>The British Creasy's Tobacco Factory Generously Donates 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>To Help Our Refugees</p>
<p>The Mayor of London launched a fundraising campaign to help refugees in our country, and the results were very impressive. A total of over 13,000 pounds in British money were donated, equivalent to about 130,000 yuan in national currency. Among them, the famous British "Creasy's Tobacco" factory alone donated over 520 pounds in British money, equivalent to about 10,000 yuan in national currency. This factory is the manufacturer of Creaven and other cigarettes.</p>
<h3>German Professor at Tongji University Willing to Help</h3>
<p>The Wusong campus of the National Tongji University was destroyed by enemy artillery fire in this battle, and classes are now temporarily relocated to Jinhua, Zhejiang. Two German professors from the school have already gone to Jinhua, and it is reported that there are still twelve people who will also be going there in the coming days. Both the German government and the public expressed their regret over the destruction of the school. The German professors expressed their willingness to do their best to assist President Weng Zhilong in planning the restoration.</p>

<p>Zhabei is set ablaze, smoke fills the sky, preventing the enemy from advancing. Our troops gather in Western Shanghai, morale is calm and defenses are actively deployed. The positions in Nanshi and Pudong are fortified and can engage the enemy in a protracted war.</p>
<p>After our troops automatically withdrew southward from Dachang and Miaoxing, the enemy simultaneously entered Dachang from the northwest and aggressively advanced westward along the Dachang-Zhenru highway. The vanguard troops reached the Zhenru International Radio Station and continued to advance southward. Our troops defended the Zhenru Railway Station, deploying new positions along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line to tightly block the enemy. Our right flank, the Jiangwan position in Zhabei, was cut off from its rear transportation lines by the enemy. To avoid unnecessary and excessive sacrifices, our military authorities ordered a full withdrawal to the southwest at 10 PM last night. Our frontline troops immediately launched a major counterattack to cover the retreat. By 4 AM this morning, our right-wing troops had completed their movement. The enemy still dared not advance rashly. Around 6 AM this morning, a small number of enemy troops advanced from Qiujiang Road and other places toward Baoshan Road, occupying the North Railway Station and the office building of the Roads Bureau. At 6:15 AM, the enemy flag was raised on the roof of the Management Bureau building. After 7 AM, the enemy continued to advance. To implement the scorched earth policy, our last withdrawing troops burned down all the civilian houses in Zhabei. For a time, thick smoke covered the sky, and a somber atmosphere pervaded the Kaifeng Road area. Our defending soldiers expressed their determination not to retreat and their willingness to share life and death with the nation. After repeated persuasion and encouragement from their superiors, the thousands of soldiers began their painful withdrawal after 10 AM this morning. This newspaper's reporter went to the end of North Xizang Road this afternoon to observe from afar, and also inspected the high-rise buildings across the Suzhou Creek. Enemy flags were hoisted on all of them, and enemy sentries were on the rooftops, using flag signals. Enemy soldiers and enemy flags were also present on the opposite side of the Hengfeng Road Bridge. Intermittent sounds of machine guns and rifles were heard, which were fired by our loyal and brave soldiers who refused to retreat, causing the enemy to shrink back and dare not penetrate deeply. This great national spirit is truly worthy of shining throughout the world. Currently, our troops are deploying a new defensive line in a circular fashion along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in the Western Shanghai area. If the enemy continues to advance, they will be resolutely attacked. It is expected that fierce battles will unfold on both sides of the Suzhou Creek in the future. As for the Nanxiang area, the enemy and our forces are still in stalemate near Xiaonanxiang. The war situation north of Guangfu is quiet. As for the situation in the Nanshi area, everything is as usual. Our military authorities firmly stated that Pudong and Nanshi would never be easily abandoned. Our new positions are extremely solid and can engage the enemy in a protracted war.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter with the troops in Zhenru reported at 12:30 PM on the 26th: The enemy troops fiercely attacked west of Dachang, and our first line of defense was broken through. The enemy is advancing southward, and a fierce battle has begun at the Zhenru Radio Station. While reinforcing, we considered that the Dachang, Miaoxing, and Jiangwan areas were at risk of having their rear routes cut off. Therefore, starting at 9 AM yesterday, we withdrew southwestward from these three areas and gathered at the second line of defense to defend Zhabei and Zhenru. By evening, the Zhenru Radio Station reported an emergency again, and Zhabei was also threatened. Therefore, at 10 PM last night, an order was issued to continue the retreat, still defending the line of the North Railway Station, Pengpu, and Jinan University. At that time, the fierce battle near the Zhenru Radio Station was still ongoing, and a battle also broke out at Mengjiazhai, east of Xiaonanxiang. Although our troops retreated with forbearance due to strategic considerations, their morale was high and they were not discouraged in the slightest. The fierce battles at both locations are still ongoing this morning. As for the North Railway Station, it is also gradually withdrawing westward. By dawn today, the key point of Zhabei, which had been defended for more than seventy days, had to be abandoned with pain.</p>
<h3>Our Troops in Jiangwan and Zhabei Withdrew West Last Night</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan-Dachang Highway was breached by enemy troops yesterday. The rear route was invaded, so a strategic retreat was made. Fierce fighting is currently underway near Zhenru.</p>
<p>A large number of enemy troops fiercely attacked our forces. After our troops withdrew from Dachang, enemy troops continued to advance west of the highway, heading straight for the Zhenru Highway, attempting to occupy our Zhenru Railway Station. Our supporting troops have rushed to intercept them. Fierce fighting is still underway near the International Radio Station. Our officers and soldiers are bravely resisting. By noon, the enemy troops had not yet reached the railway line. At dawn this morning, a large number of enemy planes, numbering hundreds, fiercely bombed the Zhenru Railway Station and the airspace above our troops, attempting to threaten our troops who were fighting. Even though bullets rained down and enemy planes filled the sky, our officers and soldiers were not afraid in the slightest, advancing one after another, and are still fiercely resisting.</p>
<p>After the enemy troops occupied Dachang, the Jiangwan-Dachang highway on the east side of the Shanghai-Tai Highway was also breached by enemy troops, invading the rear route of our troops in Jiangwan. Although our troops bravely resisted, due to strategic considerations, our troops in Jiangwan had to withdraw in an orderly manner starting at midnight last night. At the same time, due to the withdrawal from Jiangwan, Zhabei also fell into extreme difficulty. Therefore, an order was simultaneously issued to withdraw southward to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line. The withdrawal was completed by noon today. When our troops withdrew, they set fire to all defensive works. For a time, flames soared into the sky and black smoke blotted out the sun. The enemy troops initially dared not penetrate deeply. After 6 AM this morning, the enemy troops slowly surged into Zhabei from Bazilu, Qiujiang Road, Hengbang Bridge, and other places toward the North Railway Station and Baoxing Road. After 8 AM, enemy troops were found in Hengfeng Road, Guangfu Road, Datong Road, and Wuzhen Road. The works built by our troops from the south side of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line to the Suzhou Creek are extremely strong. If the enemy invades again, it will be difficult for them to succeed.</p>
<p>According to another report, our side, due to the enemy breaching the Dachang line of defense, for strategic reasons and to concentrate forces, had no choice but to painfully abandon the defense line in Zhabei. Yesterday, the heavy artillery unit stationed in Zhabei was first withdrawn, and late at night our defending troops were also ordered to make an orderly retreat. Initially, the enemy was completely unaware, and when they later discovered it, our troops had been retreating for a long time. However, the enemy was still afraid of being ambushed and did not dare to penetrate deeply, firing intensively with artillery at Zhabei to test the situation. Only when it was clear this morning did they send teams into our Zhabei positions. The North Railway Station was occupied by the enemy at 6:15 AM this morning. The enemy immediately raised an enemy flag on the top of the Roads Bureau and on the eastern wireless tower. At the same time, many enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in various places west of the North Railway Station, dropping a large number of bombs to detect whether our side had an ambush. A large number of bombs were dropped in Xinzang Road, Menggu Road, and north of the Suzhou Creek, in Kulun Road, and Xinmin Road. At that time, the houses in Huatongfang along North Xizang Road, near the Suzhou Creek and behind the warehouses of the Continental Bank, suddenly caught fire, burning fiercely. The fire spread quickly, and soon burned to the houses along North Xizang Road. The fire brigades of the various districts of the Public Concession, fearing that the fire would spread into the Concession, immediately dispatched a large number of fire engines to rush to the scene to put out the fire inside the Concession. The firemen on the roof of the Bank of China on North Xizang Road bravely put out the fire from a high position with hoses. The Laozha and Huishi police stations implemented temporary martial law on both sides of the Xiamen Road and Zhejiang Road bridges, as well as on various roads near the fire zone. British troops and Chinese and Western detectives were also fully mobilized to maintain order. As of the reporter's writing, the fire had not yet been extinguished. When the enemy troops occupied the North Railway Station, they raised a large balloon in the eastern district of Hongkou, writing on it that the enemy had occupied Dachang. When the enemy entered Zhabei, one part of the enemy troops advanced to the intersection of Menggu Road and North Xizang Road. Our large forces had already withdrawn, and only a few of our loyal and brave soldiers were still holding the position and refusing to retreat. At that time, someone advised them to abandon their weapons and enter the Concession to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, but these soldiers firmly refused. When the enemy approached, they resisted and made the most glorious sacrifice. Since the start of the Shanghai war, many residents living along the Concession and inside Zhabei had not moved out. This morning, they also followed the troops as they withdrew, throwing objects out from inside the wire fences of the Concession, and then followed out. Although they were in a state of panic, the order was still good. The order in the Concession area north of the Suzhou Creek was still good. Trolleybuses on Route 6 were still running as usual.</p>
<h3>Latest News</h3>
<p>At 2 PM this afternoon, this newspaper's reporter went to the western district to inspect. Our troops and enemy troops were engaged in fierce fighting along the railway line. The sound of machine guns and artillery was as dense as a string of pearls. Residents in the vicinity fled to the Shanghai West Concession. The Concession authorities are taking measures to accommodate and provide relief.</p>
<h3>A Certain Military Officer Discusses the Reasons for Our Withdrawal from Zhabei</h3>
<p>If the enemy troops invade again in the future, they will have to pay an even greater price.</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: This morning, a certain military official who came here from the front line told a reporter from the Dagong News Agency that our troops automatically withdrew to the second line of defense due to strategic reasons. The defending forces in Zhabei, because of their exposed position and vulnerability to attack, also withdrew simultaneously last night. Therefore, in the future, our side will have new developments in the overall strategy. In other words, the advantages that the enemy troops have gained in the past will completely disappear from now on, and our side will be able to fully develop the strength to resist the enemy. Therefore, it is impossible for the enemy troops to obtain certain places. Even if they spend a heavier price than they did in the past two months of combat, it will only increase their sacrifices and will not help the war in the slightest. What must be stated now is that although our troops have abandoned a corner of Zhabei, the plan to protect the entire city of Shanghai is still firmly maintained. This is something that can be told to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>An Enemy Plane Shot Down in Zhenru</h3>
<p>It crashed on Zhongshan Road Bridge, and the people and plane were destroyed.</p>
<p>This morning, more than a hundred enemy planes flew all over the sky near the Zhenru Railway Station, wantonly bombing. One of them was damaged by our anti-aircraft units and immediately fled. It crashed on the Zhongshan Road Bridge in Western Shanghai, and the people and plane were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Our Positions in Nanxiang are Extremely Solid</h3>
<p>No fierce fighting from Guangfu to Luodian and Liuhe.</p>
<p>The enemy north of Dachang, attempting to invade Nanxiang from Chenjiaxiang, is still being blocked by our troops east of Xiaonanxiang. Although they have repeatedly attacked our positions, they have all been repelled by our troops. Our Nanxiang positions are still extremely solid. There was no fierce fighting last night on the line from Chenjiaxiang north to Guangfu and then to Luodian and Liuhe. Both sides' main forces are concentrated around Dachang.</p>
<h3>There is Absolutely No Danger in Pudong Positions</h3>
<p>After our troops shifted to new positions to the west due to strategic reasons, all parties are quite concerned about the Pudong positions across the river. It has been verified that our troops in Pudong have strong fortifications and a strong force, and are equipped with strong artillery units. Over the past two months, the enemy has repeatedly used a joint attack by the naval and air forces in dozens of battles of varying sizes, but has not achieved the dream of landing. A reporter visited a certain officer this morning and also said that the new strategy has no impact on Pudong, and the other side has no strength to divide their troops to attack Pudong. As the other side has been focusing all of its efforts on attacking the Dachang area in recent days, the entire Pudong line has been quiet. If the enemy wants to take advantage of this opportunity to land on any shore of Pudong, they will be annihilated without a doubt, because our side is able to deal with everything.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Drop Bombs in Pudong Again</h3>
<p>The Catholic Church in Jinjiaxiang was bombed.</p>
<p>At dawn this morning, two enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Nanshi, Rihui Port, and Gaochang Temple area, dropping absurd leaflets, and then flew towards Pudong. At around 8 AM, several enemy planes flew low over Pudong's Zhengjiawan, Zhangjiabang, Panjiazai, Xinmalu, Lujiazui, and Dongjiao areas, circled, dropped bombs, and frequently strafed pedestrians with machine guns.</p>
<p>Also, enemy planes have been continuously bombing innocent civilians and houses in the Pudong area for days, and it is not enough. They are now attacking peaceful organizations that promote religion, regardless of international law. The Jinjiaxiang Catholic Church in Pudong has been bombed twice and completely destroyed. The Zhangjialou Catholic Church was bombed once and suffered less damage. This morning at 8:45 AM, two enemy planes dropped four bombs on the Zhangjialou Catholic Church, two of which landed inside the church, completely destroying the school buildings and one corner of the auditorium.</p>
<h3>More than 3,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive Again</h3>

In addition, they also brought forty or fifty small motorboats and a large number of munitions (unloaded at the China Merchants Bureau's Central and Northern warehouses).</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb and Destroy Two Cotton Mills, Killing and Wounding More Than 200 People</h3>
<p>The Triangle Vegetable Market was also hit, and more than 100 vegetable vendors and others were killed and wounded.</p>
<p>At around 9:30 AM this morning, twelve enemy planes flew to Bailinan Road in Zhoujiaqiao, Western Shanghai, and dropped more than ten bombs. The first to be hit was the Shenxin No. 1 Mill and the Minsheng Cotton Mill. The furnace rooms and cotton rooms of both mills caught fire and burned, and the internal machinery and cotton were completely destroyed. Only the outer corridors and houses remained. Approximately two hundred male workers were killed and wounded in the two mills. Several bombs also fell on the Triangle Vegetable Market. It happened to be crowded with residents buying vegetables. After the bombing, more than one hundred vegetable buyers and vendors were killed and wounded on the spot, with broken arms and legs, burnt heads and faces, and groaning on the roadside. The scene was unbearable. Order was chaotic. The Chinese and Concession police authorities quickly ordered a large number of detectives to rush to maintain order, and at the same time notified the Red Cross rescue team to risk their lives to rush to the rescue, burying the dead one by one, and carrying the wounded to various hospitals for treatment.</p>
<h3>Italian Soldiers Killed by Enemy Anti-Aircraft Shells</h3>
<p>Hasegawa Sends Representatives to Apologize to the Italian Army</p>
<p>At 2:40 AM this morning, when our air force launched a night attack on enemy positions, enemy ships fired anti-aircraft guns in disarray, causing many stray bullets to fall on the Italian army's defensive area on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. An Italian soldier, Padula, was hit in the head by a bullet and suffered serious injuries, and died on the spot. The Italian army authorities immediately protested to the headquarters of the Japanese Third Fleet, and Hasegawa immediately sent representatives to apologize to the Italian army.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Circle Over British Army Defensive Area, British Army Opens Fire as a Warning</h3>
<p>At 7:45 AM this morning, several enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over the Bailinan Road area in Western Shanghai. This area is the British army's defensive area. Previously, after enemy planes strafed and killed one British soldier each on Kaixuan Road, the British army was ordered to prepare for air defense. Therefore, this morning, the British army opened fire with anti-aircraft machine guns as a warning, and the enemy planes flew away.</p>
<h3>Compatriots in Manado, Netherlands East Indies, Generously Donate to Jointly Overcome the National Crisis</h3>
<p>In addition to raising donations of 100,000, monthly donations are also being solicited. This achievement in this small port is truly admirable.</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Federation in this city received a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manado, Netherlands East Indies, yesterday: After the news of the Lugou Bridge Incident came, our Chamber of Commerce immediately organized a Red Cross and started fundraising. Fortunately, with the authority of the Central Government, more than a thousand Chinese overseas from all ages in this port enthusiastically donated, reaching 100,000 yuan in national currency. The first remittance of 10,000 yuan in national currency was sent to the Central Military Commission, and the following five military remittances were all delivered to the Shanghai Chinese Red Cross, totaling more than 60,000 yuan in national currency. The remaining funds will be remitted in the near future and can continue to be sent. Furthermore, considering that the strong invaders have not yet ceased their aggression and that self-defense will take a long time, we have also actively carried out monthly donation work. It is estimated that these monthly donations will be about seven or eight thousand guilders (approximately 15,000 yuan in national currency). With this achievement in our small port, it is enough to prove that our people have the determination to resist the enemy and the spirit to jointly overcome the national crisis. There is indeed a dawn for the future of the nation. Therefore, we are reporting the fundraising process accordingly and hope that you will review and approve. With the utmost respect and friendship.</p>
<h3>Annie Morrison Girls' School Completely Destroyed by Enemy Bombing</h3>

<h3>Smooth Counteroffensive on the Pinghan Railway, Our Troops Advance to Handan</h3>

<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference, US Delegation Arrives in England</h3>
<p>The issue of inviting Germany and Russia can be decided immediately. Bolivia has expressed its intention to participate in the conference.</p>
<p>[London] The chief US representative to the Nine-Power Conference, Davis, arrived in Plymouth today. He told a Reuters interviewer that he dared not predict the outcome of the Beijing conference. He hoped that Japan could join the conference to study whether we could find a constructive solution to the difficult problems of the Far East. It is heard that the issue of inviting Germany and the Soviet Union to join the conference can be decided soon. Several countries have not yet expressed their agreement, so a decision must wait until their agreement is obtained. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Bolivian Embassy in the United States recently announced that the country has decided to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and will send its envoy to Switzerland, Costa, to attend the Beijing conference. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Expresses His Views on the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Organizing the people is the most urgent task. Although the enemy is stubborn, victory will ultimately belong to us.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Li Zongren recently returned from the front and gave a statement to reporters regarding his views on the War of Resistance. Li first stated that the violent Japanese aggression against us, their meticulous planning, is necessary to destroy the entire China. We can only defend our territory by resisting to the death. The loyal and brave soldiers on our front lines, fighting in the blood, are truly enough to shock the earth and move the gods. Our country has this Great Wall of flesh and blood, and we are even more confident that we can achieve final victory. During this war of resistance, the whole country should urgently "mobilize the spirit," and organizing the people and training the people are the most urgent tasks. It is believed that the government must work closely with the people in order to generate great power. It is argued that university students, in addition to science and engineering, should focus on the manufacture of military supplies, while the remaining liberal arts students must all go deep into the countryside and assume the task of training the people. Regarding general propaganda methods, Li said that in addition to newspapers and magazines, emphasis should be placed on plays and speeches. When reporters asked about the Guangxi army's expedition situation, Li smiled and said that he felt ashamed for not being able to quickly send out troops this time, but it was also due to inconvenient transportation. When the wealthy Guangxi army received the conscription order, several regiments were stationed in Guilin and Chenzhou, and the rest were engaged in mining and road construction. After receiving the order, all were excited and enthusiastic. Fathers and brothers learned that their children were going on expeditions and regarded it as the highest honor. Even peasant women had no reluctance at the time of farewell, but repeatedly exhorted their husbands to swear to kill the enemy. Li then told reporters that Guangxi has been training strong men for years and can now mobilize more than two million. Although the enemy is stubborn, our united will is enough to sweep away their ferocity. In recent times, enemy planes have wantonly bombed various places, further strengthening the hearts of our people to hate the enemy and share the same hatred. Soldiers are fighting on the battlefield, sacrificing their lives to defend their motherland, which is truly called dying in the right place. As a member of the military, I am about to return to the front and vow to fight the Japanese to the death. When he spoke, his attitude was extremely firm, and the conversation lasted about an hour before it concluded. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Hijacked and Insulted by Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Panamanian-flagged Hong Kong-Vietnam merchant ship Chikan was hijacked by Japanese warships one day at sea 100 miles from Hong Kong, forced to Penghu, and then to Taiwan, where it was subjected to various insults. The shipowner, Xia Minde, the Danish captain, Nelson, and the crew of fifty-two people were escorted to Hong Kong on the Hong Kong Maru on the 26th and regained their freedom. Xia and others were extremely indignant at the Japanese side's abuse. The Consul-General of Panama in Hong Kong has reported to the government and has decided to lodge a serious protest with Japan. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Trivial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Our troops have retreated in a planned and orderly manner from Dachang, Miaoxing, Zhabei, and other places. But there is no need to be doubtful or fearful about this retreat. Because this retreat was within our expectations. We are fighting a flat war, while they are fighting a three-dimensional war. They are fighting with artillery and tanks, while we are only fighting with rifles and machine guns. The mechanical aspects are too different. But we have been able to sustain such a war for more than seventy days, causing the enemy to suffer significant sacrifices and considerable costs. If we cannot say that this is an active success in our war of resistance, we can also say that it is a passive victory. Therefore, foreign reports on the Shanghai war say that no matter how the Sino-Japanese war situation develops in the future, China has already gained a significant advantage, which is not an empty statement.</p>

<h3>A Week of Enemy Aircraft Attacking Guangdong, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Suffering Severe Bombardment</h3>
<p>Many Civilian Houses Near Humen and Huangpu Were Burned</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the enemy aircraft carriers sailed to waters outside Zhongshan Port in Zhongshan County, Tangjia Bay, and off Yamen in Xinhui County, and Chiwan in Bao'an County, and anchored there, from the 6th onwards, they have dispatched aircraft several times a day to attack various parts of the province. Merchants cannot find peace, farmers abandon their fields, and citizens cannot sleep or eat in peace. Our air force, indignant at the enemy aircraft's ferocity, also engaged them in counterattacks. It is estimated that from the 6th to the 12th, over the course of a week, several enemy aircraft were damaged, and one was shot down. One fell into the sea off Hengdang Township, at the junction of Shunde and Zhongshan counties, one fell in Yushan Village, Ping'an Township, in the ninth district of Zhongshan County, and one fell near Shasan in Dongguan County. The following is a summary record of the enemy aircraft's bombing of various key areas over the past week:</p>
<p>Suburbs of Guangzhou</p>
<p>On October 7th, six enemy aircraft arrived at 9:00 AM and dropped over twenty bombs in the eastern suburbs, destroying over thirty civilian houses nearby and killing dozens of villagers. At about 1:00 PM, three more enemy aircraft came and dropped several more bombs in the eastern suburbs. On the morning of the 8th, at 9:35 AM, six enemy aircraft dropped seven or eight bombs in the area along Huadi Road in the northern suburbs, attempting to bomb the Niulangang ×× School, burning over twenty civilian houses and killing over twenty villagers, their bodies torn apart, a gruesome sight. Nearby graves were turned into giant holes, and skeletons were destroyed. On the 9th, twenty-eight enemy aircraft flew over the suburbs at high altitude, attacking Humen and the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, but did not drop any bombs. The 10th was the Double Tenth National Day, and the enemy bombed Sun Yat-sen University, the highest institution of learning in Guangdong, and the Shipai Municipal Relief Center, a charitable organization, leaving us with a profound sense of anger and hatred. On the morning of the 10th, at about 8:00 AM, five enemy aircraft were first spotted in the eastern suburbs, dropping eighteen bombs, including three on the agricultural field of Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai. As the enemy aircraft flew over Baiyun Mountain, one was damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery, but dozens of civilian houses near Shahe were destroyed, killing over ten villagers. The poor people's dormitory at the Shipai Relief Center was also hit, destroying several outbuildings of the dormitory and damaging over ten poor people. On the morning of the 11th, at about 7:00 AM, twenty-four enemy aircraft took off from Tangjia Bay and Yamen, dividing into routes to attack. Five flew to the eastern suburbs and dropped over ten bombs from an altitude of 7,000 to 8,000 feet. Five bombs hit nearby civilian houses, destroying over thirty houses and killing over ten villagers. Soon after, they flew to Shipai and Sun Yat-sen University and dropped two bombs, but fortunately missed.</p>
<p>Humen and Huangpu</p>
<p>The enemy's bombing targets over the past week have focused on key fortresses such as Humen, Huangpu, Changzhou, and Yuzhu. On the 7th, enemy aircraft attacked three times, once against the suburbs of Guangzhou, once against the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, and once bombing Humen and Huangpu. At 9:20 AM that morning, six enemy aircraft first appeared over Humen, circling and observing. After a long time, they flew to Huangpu and dropped twelve bombs on the old Naval Mine Bureau in that area, burning over ten houses in nearby villages and killing twenty to thirty villagers. On the 8th, over twenty enemy aircraft attacked the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the northern suburbs of Guangzhou. At 9:00 AM on the 9th, eighteen enemy aircraft focused on bombing key stations in the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. At the same time, four aircraft attacked Humen twice. The first time was at 9:30 AM, when they dropped six bombs. One bomb hit a wooden sentry post at Humen, but the sentry had already left to take cover, so he escaped unharmed. The second time was at 10:40 AM, when three enemy aircraft came and dropped four bombs, all of which landed in the mountains, causing no damage to the fort. On the 10th, eight enemy aircraft flew over Humen, then flew to Huangpu and Changzhou, dropping three bombs, destroying over ten houses in Shangzhuang and Xiazhuang villages and killing several villagers. On the morning of the 11th, at about 7:00 AM, three enemy aircraft flew from Yuzhu to Huangpu, dropping several bombs, then dropping three bombs near the Changzhou fort, all of which missed. However, several dozen houses were burned in the villages near Huangpu and Changzhou, killing and injuring forty to fifty people. On the 11th, eight enemy aircraft flew over Humen again and headed towards northern Guangdong. In recent days, Huangpu has been bombarded by enemy bombs, and the central area has become scorched earth. Many new construction projects have also been destroyed. The power lines between Humen and Guangzhou were once cut off, but were soon repaired and communication was restored as usual. The fortifications of the various fortresses are very solid, and the defenses are strong, so it is not easy for the enemy to succeed.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<p>The enemy has been scheming and plotting to destroy the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, so since the end of last month, they have been sending heavy bombers every day to indiscriminately drop bombs on various stations in the southern section of the railway, and have dropped over a hundred giant bombs on Gangjiang Station, also targeting the mouth of the Gangjiang River for bombing. On the 6th of this month, the enemy sent as many as thirty-five aircraft to attack in a large-scale operation. On the morning of the 7th, at about 10:00 AM, seventeen enemy aircraft flew to the northern suburbs of Guangzhou and headed north along the southern section of the railway, dropping bombs on Shijing, Jiangcun, and other stations. When they reached Yingde, our air force intercepted them in the air, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting over Maba. The enemy aircraft fought and fled, putting up slight resistance when they reached Gangjiang Station, then turning south to escape. In this battle, it is estimated that two enemy aircraft were damaged by our air force. After the enemy was defeated, they did not give up their ambitions, and at about 2:00 PM, they sent fifteen aircraft to attack again, first dropping bombs on Yinzhan'ao, Juntian, and Gangjiang stations, totaling sixty to seventy bombs, then invading Qujiang, where they encountered our air force and another fierce battle broke out. The enemy aircraft had a one-to-two numerical advantage, but our air force still fought bravely to resist, and by 3:30 PM, the enemy aircraft were finally driven back. On that day, one of the enemy aircraft that was damaged by us crashed into the sea at Hengdang, and another went missing. At noon on the 8th, twelve enemy aircraft returned to Gangjiang Station and flew to Yingde to bomb, dropping over ten bombs, and also dropping seven or eight bombs at Wushi Station, destroying fifty to sixty civilian houses and killing over twenty people. Later, our air force launched an attack, engaging them at Yingde and Gangjiang. By about 2:00 PM, the enemy aircraft ran out of bombs and fled in a panic. At noon on the 9th, sixteen enemy aircraft attacked the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, dropping forty to fifty bombs along Yinzhan'ao, Yuantan, and Juntian stations. The tracks near Dakengkou in Qujiang above Yingde were all destroyed. Over thirty bombs fell in Qujiang City, and part of the South Gate Bridge in Shaozhou was damaged. Twenty-nine boatmen on the river were killed. Eight bombs fell in the Qujiang urban area, and civilian houses were burned. The fire did not die down until 9:00 PM. The loss of life and property was incalculable. On the 10th, twenty enemy aircraft flew a roundabout route to spy on the Guangzhou-Sanshui section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, but were bombed by our anti-aircraft artillery. They then flew to Qujiang and dropped over fifty more bombs on the East Gate Bridge, South Gate Bridge, and Simiao Street, Xunfeng Road, Fenglie Road, Fengdu Road, and various inner streets in Shaoguan, destroying over a hundred civilian houses and shops, causing a major disaster. On the 11th, at 9:00 AM, fourteen enemy aircraft flew to Yinzhan'ao and dropped eight or nine bombs. At about 10:00 AM, they flew to Yingzui Station and dropped five bombs. Soon after, they returned to Yinzhan'ao and dropped over ten more bombs. Many civilian houses at various stations were bombed, and hundreds of villagers were killed. In total, from the 6th to the 11th, enemy aircraft flew to bomb the railway three or four times a day, dropping an average of fifty bombs each day. It is estimated that forty to fifty zhang of railway tracks were destroyed at Yuantan, Yinzhan'ao, Gangjiang, Yingde, Maba, and Qujiang above Jiangcun.</p>
<h3>Enemy Traces Found on Sijiao and Tanhu Beaches</h3>
<p>Mountain Villagers and Fishermen All Suffered Trampling</p>
<p>Zhelin Correspondence: There have long been rumors outside that Sijiao Mountain has been occupied by enemy warships landing there. Now it is learned that several enemy warships did indeed moor off the mountain several weeks ago. Many traitors from north of the Yangtze River guided them to land, intending to survey the land and build a pier, hoping to establish a base. However, the foot of the mountain is all reefs and tidal flats, and the water flow is rapid and turbulent, repeatedly causing damage, making construction difficult. About a hundred mountain villagers were trampled upon and suffered terribly. All fishing nets and boats were seized by enemy boats, and they were arbitrarily massacred. In terms of food supplies, the mountain's sweet potato production was almost completely exhausted, and even the amount of freshwater stored was very small. The enemy was very alarmed by this, so many have already left voluntarily. On the 24th, refugee fishermen reported that Tanhu Mountain, seventy or eighty li from Jinshanwei, was also landed on by the enemy the day before. They first completely destroyed all the wireless radios, lighthouses, and other equipment of the Huangsha Company on the mountain, and then went out to loot. The mountain villagers were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. Before leaving, the enemy seized dozens of fishing boats of all sizes, towing them to nearby enemy warships with gasoline boats. All the fishermen on board were monitored and unable to escape. Along the coast near Qinchongtang, enemy aircraft have frequently been flying low to scout in recent days, and have dropped bombs at Yanggongmiao and other places near Jinshanwei, but fortunately there were no casualties. As for other coastal areas, due to the authorities' thorough defenses, the market remains quiet as usual.</p>
<h3>Confiscation and Severe Punishment for Trading in Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>City West Joint Association Suggests to Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from the Shanghai City West Joint Welfare Association, which stated: "Respectfully, according to the suggestion adopted by your Chamber from the Association of Industrial Circles for National Salvation, a notice was sent to various trade associations to issue separate letters to various companies and shops to add the words 'This company or shop does not trade in Japanese goods' on the packaging paper of their goods. Our Association believes there is something that cannot be left unsaid. Although this method is one of the ways to promote economic severance through publicity, we fear that its actual ability to alert people's hearts and achieve results is doubtful. Merchants in this city are of varying quality, making it impossible to distinguish them. Those with ulterior motives may use this text as a cover to carry out their tricks of passing off enemy goods, trying to deceive people. Customers who do not discern the truth are easily deceived, thinking that since there is a sign that enemy goods are not sold, they will naturally not suspect anything else. As a result, unscrupulous merchants are given the opportunity to promote their sales. Therefore, in the opinion of our Association, this text is impractical and its effect is equivalent to a mere formality. It would be better to change it to words such as 'This store does not trade in Japanese goods; if found, please confiscate and punish severely,' so that under the supervision of the general public, they will know what to fear and dare not openly use their tricks. At the same time, send letters to relevant organizations to earnestly implement the resolutions on economic severance against Japan, acting vigorously and without allowing any leniency. We believe that those who trade in enemy goods may therefore have concerns. Whether this is appropriate or not, we hope you will consider and adopt it, issue a notice for implementation, and promote public justice."</p>
<h3>Refugee Work Design Council Collects Opinions</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, more than two months have passed. Apart from those who have taken refuge in the war zone and have been sent to the interior by charitable organizations and various hometown associations, it is known from surveys that there are still over 100,000 people in Shanghai's refugee shelters, including 30,000 to 40,000 adult men, most of whom are healthy. Sitting idly and doing nothing for a long time will not only cause difficulties in terms of supplies, but will also develop into a habit in the future, turning healthy and useful people into dependent and lazy people. Even if there are jobs in the future, they may be too lazy to work, which will have a significant impact on the country, society, and their personal future. At present, the war atmosphere is very bad, and enemy aircraft are doing their best to destroy transportation. If these people are allowed to work outside the concessions, such as building roads, they will inevitably be bombed and strafed, endangering their lives, which is not appropriate. Therefore, they must be put to appropriate labor within the concessions. In view of this, the Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross has organized a Refugee Work Design Committee to study the above issue. However, since there are not many members, in order to gather wisdom from all sources, it is planned to invite suggestions from people in society to observe their completion and achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>Commander Han's Letter of Thanks to the Rescue Association</h3>
<p>Rescuing Those in Danger is Nothing Less Than Rebirth, the Rescue Teams Should Increase Their Efforts</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, the Shanghai Rescue Committee has dispatched rescue teams to the front lines to actively rescue the wounded. Yesterday, a letter was received from Han Xiying, commander of the ×× Division of the ×th Army of the Army, praising the work of the committee. The following is an excerpt from the letter: "The violent Japanese are invading us, and the whole country shares the same hatred. Your committee is at the forefront of the people, leading the masses to participate in national salvation work. Such a great spirit truly inspires the weak and timid to stand up. Our division has been ordered to resist the enemy, fulfilling the soldier's duty to defend the country and protect the people. The officers and soldiers of the department also understand the supreme meaning of not allowing an inch or a foot of land to be lost, and swear to resist without the slightest discouragement. However, the violent Japanese are wielding sharp weapons and bombing wantonly, causing heavy casualties. Those with severed limbs and broken feet are crawling and waiting for help. Fortunately, your committee's rescue team enthusiastically assisted in escorting them to the hospital, allowing them to find a safe place to stay. Rescuing those in danger is nothing less than rebirth. Out of admiration, I hereby lead all officers and soldiers to express our sincere gratitude." After receiving the letter, the committee immediately issued a notice to all rescue teams to increase their efforts and work hard to rescue the wounded.</p>
<h3>New Commander of US Marine Corps Visited Commander Yang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Extremely Praising and Admiring Our Anti-Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>The newly appointed Commander of the US Marine Corps in Shanghai, Bo Meng, who originally served as a colonel in the US Marine Corps Headquarters in Shanghai, was promoted to major general some years ago and transferred back to his country to serve in the military. He was then reassigned as the commander of the garrison in Seattle. He has now been transferred back to Shanghai to take up his post. Yesterday (the 26th) morning at 10:30 AM, accompanied by his aide-de-camp, Qiqi Ji, he paid a visit to Yang Hu, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, as his first visit after resuming his post. Yang met with them along with his secretary, Sun Lvpang. It was a happy reunion, and they chatted happily. Bo expressed extreme praise for the loyalty and bravery of our country's anti-Japanese soldiers, saying that since the invention of modern weapons, he had never seen another country that could resist the enemy's fierce attacks from land, sea, and air with just infantry, and still stand firm and defend its position like China. At the same time, he said that the vigorous morale on the Shanghai front was especially commendable. After talking for half an hour, they took a photo and shook hands in farewell. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Commander Yang and his secretary, Sun Lvpang, returned the visit to the British Consul-General, Mr. Feilibo.</p>
<h3>Catholic People Enthusiastically Rescuing</h3>
<p>Taoist Nuns Working Diligently All Day Long, Priests Go to Assist</p>
<p>According to the China Press, two Catholic priests from this port went to Songjiang on Sunday morning to assist in the treatment of more than 400 civilians who were injured by the bombing of the area by Japanese aircraft on Sunday afternoon. It is said that most of the bombed area was the new area outside Songjiang City, and the devastation was unbearable to see. More than 200 men, women, and children were killed instantly, and about 100 houses were destroyed. The local Catholic hospital was almost hit by a bomb, but four French Taoist nuns are still caring for those injured by the bombs, working diligently all day long without rest. A Catholic school was hit by Japanese aircraft last time, and was also almost affected this time. The Japanese aircraft's main target was the long-distance bus station, and the hospital and school are both adjacent to the station, so it is now planned to move the hospital elsewhere to prevent the injured from suffering further accidents. The school is naturally closed at this time. It is said that the two priests returned to Shanghai last night.</p>

<h3>Special Report on the Battle of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wang Jinqi, Central News Agency War Correspondent</p>
<p>2. Bloody Battle of Donglin Temple</p>
<p>To the southwest of Luodian, not more than three or four li away, there is a relatively high terrain, Donglin Temple, surrounded by water on three sides, east, north, and south. At that time, it was our most prominent position. From there, we could observe the enemy's movements by defending, and cut off the enemy's rear by attacking. Therefore, after the enemy occupied Luodian, the most uneasy thing was Donglin Temple.</p>
<p>Starting from September 17th, the enemy constantly used small units to explore the use of force. The soldiers of a company stationed there repelled every enemy invasion. By the dawn of the 29th, the enemy had mobilized a large number of troops to launch a fierce attack on Donglin Temple. On the one hand, the enemy's firepower was very fierce, and on the other hand, the disparity between the numbers of the enemy and us was too great. Our position was broken through by the enemy one after another. Our guards were wounded one by one, and even died one by one. However, the few dozen remaining soldiers still kept the last drop of blood and the last bullet, desperately defending and fighting the enemy. After enduring until almost noon, our reinforcements arrived. The soldiers who were desperately defending became a suicide squad, and the soldiers of the Second Company who were reinforcing attacked from the left and right. The enemy could not support it after all. That evening, the enemy was completely repelled by us.</p>
<p>On the 30th, the enemy used various cannons, large and small, to carry out area shooting, destroying all the houses here. Then the infantry rushed over. The troops on both sides approached step by step. The enemy used intensive machine guns, automatic rifles, and small mortars, closely bombarding our troops. In order to avoid excessive sacrifices, we moved to both sides, leaving only the soldiers of the Third Squad to defend the withered temple in these broken walls, setting up several light machine guns to wait for the enemy.</p>
<p>The enemy was approaching the withered temple step by step. Our last remaining loyal and brave soldiers wanted to shake the machine gun and finish the matter with the enemy, but at this critical moment, the machine gun malfunctioned, probably due to too much shooting. But everyone remained calm and did not panic at all. Squad Leader Hu Yulin instructed his brothers who had been with him through thick and thin to bring enough hand grenades. With a shout of killing, they jumped out of the broken walls and threw them fiercely at the enemy. He himself bravely stepped forward and threw more than ten hand grenades in a row. The enemy was caught off guard. Those who were bombed died, and those who were bombed were injured. The rest saw that the situation was bad and fled in panic. At this time, our large force reunited and attacked the enemy. The enemy hurriedly turned around to meet the battle, hurriedly building fortifications in the field to confront us. Although the enemy suffered repeated defeats, they never stopped their attempt to seize Donglin Temple. On October 1st, the enemy used small units to rush over, but were beaten back several times. At dawn the next day, the enemy's artillery began to bombard again, covering the suicide squad who rushed over in droves. The rest of our troops moved out and meet the enemy. After a few hours of charging and hand-to-hand combat, the casualties on both sides were heavy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the enemy, Lieutenant Yixin, led several enemy soldiers and竄entered the broken temple through a gap. Our wounded platoon leader, Hu Yulin, was lying in the temple at this time. When he saw the enemy enter, he quickly raised his pistol and aimed at the enemy to shoot, but the pistol malfunctioned again. Platoon Leader Hu quickly thought of a plan. There was an iron shovel for digging trenches next to him. He forgot his pain, jumped up, raised the iron shovel and slashed at the enemy. Lieutenant Yixin became a ghost under the shovel. But the rest of the enemy still pounced in. Squad Leader Xu Aishan turned from the back of the temple and saw the tense situation. He held his breath, made no sound, grabbed a war knife from an enemy's back, waved it, and slashed at the enemy desperately, ending the lives of several enemy soldiers. During the melee, Private Liu Yidao was stabbed twice by the enemy. He ignored the blood flowing from his body and still raised his bayonet and fought the enemy hand-to-hand, stabbing two enemies to death one after another. This heroic fight frightened the remaining three or two enemies, who lost their weapons and fled desperately. Although we suffered great sacrifices in this hand-to-hand battle, we gained a lot of spoils of war, which made the enemy lie dormant for a few days and dare not invade.</p>
<p>Wartime Youth, Issue 23</p>
<h3>Saving the Nation and Seeking Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Guo Woli</p>
<p>At a time when the nation is on the brink of collapse, we cannot concern ourselves with our personal matters. We must move to the battle lines, dedicate all our strength, strike the aggressors, and only after averting the national crisis can we address our individual concerns.</p>
<p>However, there is a matter here that is vitally related to the war of resistance, and that is "seeking knowledge." Resolving this issue is indeed a very serious and difficult problem at present.</p>
<p>Enemy planes, disregarding humanity and trampling on international treaties, act barbarously and unreasonably, bombing our non-military cultural institutions at will, devastating everything! Our schools, which provide knowledge, have been largely reduced to rubble. How can we study then? As a result, the intellectual sustenance of most young people has been cut off.</p>
<p>Although the government and educational leaders are striving to reverse this calamity, there are still many young people without schooling. Even if some have followed schools to safer areas, shutting themselves off and studying dead books, seemingly indifferent to the life and death of the nation, is certainly not what anyone desires? Especially for spirited young people, I believe that even in the classrooms of the rear, their inner depression must be increasing.</p>
<p>The launch of the full-scale war of resistance has undoubtedly satisfied our collective desire since the "September 18th Incident," filling us with boundless excitement! It has especially given us the courage and determination to rise up resolutely, throw away our books, and step onto the front lines to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Some say, "Young people must strive to learn..." While young people certainly cannot neglect their studies, the powerful neighbor has already invaded deeply, turning our schools into crematories. The entire national life is swaying in the wind and rain, in imminent danger! We are too busy trying to save ourselves, how can we even talk about the problem of seeking knowledge? However, the famine of knowledge is indeed an important matter, and we must ensure that it does not become a terrifying situation! To achieve victory in the war of resistance, we cannot ignore this mutually reinforcing issue of knowledge.</p>
<p>Knowledge is the foundation of all endeavors. Sun Tzu's Art of War says, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." Without sufficient learning, how can we even talk about "knowing ourselves and knowing our enemy?" Thus, "never being defeated" remains a dream!</p>
<p>Here, we will roughly discuss how to deal with this situation. As mentioned earlier, shutting oneself off and studying dead books is useless, and the environment no longer makes it possible. It is best to firmly establish the concept of "studying for the war of resistance and resisting the war for studying," with the two complementing each other. The work of resistance is not limited to the front lines. The war of resistance does not distinguish between the front and the rear. Those in the safe areas of the rear, even if calmly situated in the classroom, must never study stereotyped examination essays or utopian ideologies. Instead, they must immerse themselves in various fields of study related to national salvation (such as mechanical chemistry, production technology, air defense and poison gas prevention, medical rescue, etc.). This is the greatest task of wartime education, and it is an essential duty. Therefore, we must transform the current rear area school education into a urgently needed "national defense education," and implement the laborization, scientification, and militarization of young students in the rear. In addition to preparing to directly participate in the front lines, the rest must move towards productive enterprises and construction projects. For young students who have lost their schooling and are working on the front lines and in support work, we must make use of all possible time and energy to explore new knowledge in our spare time. We must never abandon our studies and descend into a state of idleness and waste. Seeking knowledge does not have to be in schools. Battlefields, rear area workplaces, and all levels of society are our classrooms and vast libraries. As long as we concentrate our minds and diligently gather the materials we need at all times and in all places, in order to prevent a famine of knowledge, we can enhance our ability to resist the war and increase the power to save the nation.</p>
