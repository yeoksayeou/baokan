<h3>國防綫上（六）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>（四）“山西是一個謎”麽？</p>
<p>動身的前夕，和朋友們在一家酒樓上，談到我的即將出發的國防綫上的旅行。於是，有位朋友就抓抓腦袋，縐着眉說：</p>
<p>“山西？山西？！這些年來，山西情形，對我們眞是一個謎。”</p>
<p>一到太原，我就把我積在肚裏的，各種各式的疑問，一個接一個地，不住地向朋友們提了出去。這心急的神情，往往令他他們覺得好笑。於是有一回，主張公道團總團部的秒書主任薄右丞先生就笑了起來，對我說道：</p>
<p>“你們外邊人，也許，把山西看成一個謎了吧？”</p>
<p>其實，說外邊人把山西看成一個謎，倒是不至於的；不過，近幾年來，山西已經成了我們國防的第一綫。一方面全國人對他的關心和注意，是格外加重了；而另一面，山西當局各種加緊的埋頭苦幹和設施，又更加引起了全國人的注意。大家關心山西狀况，注意山西動態，希望能夠了解牠的眞象，看淸牠的全貌；但在他們的關心注意，到他們的了解看淸之間，自始至終，還有着相當的距離，使他們一時還達不到目的。這種距離，就使山西的各種情况，在外邊人士們方面，或多或少地，引起了近於“謎”樣的感覺。</p>
<p>我這－回到山西看了一趟之後，上述的這種距離，在我，已經是可存在了。我不敢說已經完全了解山西；但在大致的輪廓上，我至少已經淸除了“謎”樣的感覺。這裏，我們先說一說。什麽是造成，大家“謎”樣感覺的原因呢？</p>
<p>首先，我們當注意牠地理上的環境。在天然地勢方面，東，西，北，三面，幾乎全圍繞着山嶺，蜿蜒在東邊的太行山脈，西邊的呂梁山脈和北面的五台山，桓山等等，再加上南邊的黃河，這些，幾乎是替山西造成了一個天然的屏蔽，對外邊的交通，在此，必然以雁門關為總口，在東必然以娘子關做總口，假如把這兩個關口一封鎖，那情形，眞會呈名符其實的一閉關自守一現象。過去這二十多年，是中國由舊的君主專制式的政治統一，向新的民主共和式的政治統一去的過渡階段，因而，長期的掙扎，不斷的內戰，伏而又起的革命，等等，皆是不可免的現象。對於這些內戰革命和掙扎，山西境內，－直是沒有被捲入漩渦的。這呢，－方面，可說出於山西當局應付環境的適當；另一面，最大的原因，却由於地形的阻隔。山西這二十多年來，沒有受內戰的災害，是牠的有利處所，然而在與外邊的融合上，比起沿江沿海的各省來，就差多了。</p>
<p>說到交通情形，山西境內，的交通設備，可說是非常發達，遠在別的省份大舉建築公路以前，牠境內的各處，就已經佈滿了汽車路。然而對外省的交通，上面已經說過了，在北與東兩面，是祇有雁門關和娘子關兩個總口的。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>論改訂鹽法</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>年來中央支出。日漸膨脹。國家歲入不得不隨之俱增。度支當局籌劃舉債增稅。要皆求收支之能適合也。今年四月以後。各項統稅稅率。均已變更。鹽稅於正課以外。另增建設專欵每担一元。最近且聞有改訂鹽法之議。擬將徵稅單位之“公”斤易為“市”斤。表面上雖僅一字之差。而稅率不啻倍增。此事將來在立法院中。是否能順利通過。目前尚不可知。茲姑就管見所及。加以論列。</p>
<p>二十年五月所公布之新鹽法。原定在二十五年年底以前。次第施行。其所以至今猶未見諸事實者。據吾人之想像。殆有兩種窒礙。舊日引商之阻撓。一也。稅收有減低之虞。二也。但此兩種窒礙之發生。正足以表現新鹽法之合理。蓋新鹽法規定就塲徵稅。一稅以後任其所之。摧毀曩日之引岸制度。使食鹽有需供平衡之利。同時統一稅率。規定每百公斤徵稅五元。（漁鹽為三角）不得重徵。亦不得附加。將過去鹽稅之積幣。悉數掃凈。凡此種種。皆為新鹽法精義之所在。其最大目的。實在消滅引商與減輕人民鹽稅之負擔也。</p>
<p>今日財政當局對於新鹽法之態度不僅要求稅率之增加。抑且就“一稅以後任其所之”之政策。亦有所懷疑。例如最近鹽務總局曾仰豐氏之鹽務視察報告中。卽對新鹽法之自由主義。認為尚有問題。（見五月一日本報）按曾氏所特之理由。約有三點。㊀“任其所之”之結果。必將引起私鹽充斥。㊁國內交通不便。鹽斤運銷。必賴官廳調劑。㊂就塲一次徵稅之結果。將使商人一套之資本。祇能作半套之營業。稅收必受影響。此三者恐非確論。蓋私鹽之充斥與否。與自由運銷之本質無關。而為輯私之效果問題。至於交通不便之能影響商品運銷者。大都非必要之物。至若食鹽之類。人生不可稍缺。需要之彈性極小。且在自由主義之下。任何商人皆得競爭運銷。就商人之立塲言。但求有利可圖。就消費者之立塲言。但求其購價在能力範圍以內。關山雖阻。貿遷無礙。本不需要官廳之調劑。至於第三點理由。吾人亦不無懷疑。蓋在今日引岸制度之下。一區以內。鹽商僅為一人。是以一次徵稅之結果。容或發生資本滯澀之現象。然而在新鹽法之自由運銷主義之前提下。商人不限於一人。資本亦不限於一套縱令一套之資本。祇能作半套之營業。當亦不致影響於稅收也。</p>
<p>尤有進者。據新鹽法所規定。鹽稅絕對不許附加。然依今日之情形而論。鹽稅之地方附加。時有所聞。中央其能使之立時務徵乎。卽在中央自身。甚亦有斷然取消附加之决心與可能乎。近二月來。如廣東新增鐵路建設附加稅五角。中央新徵建設專欵附加一元。此種新徵難以立廢。殆可斷言也。</p>
<p>總之。新鹽法有三特點。一為廢除引商。二為減低鹽稅。三為停徵附加。而此三者又有不可分之聯緊性。斷不容支解割裂。然就目前之事務而觀。稅率旣不能減低。引岸又不能盡廢。附加亦難以停徵。若新鹽法為遷就此種情勢而改訂。則其精義盡失。吾人何貴乎有此種新鹽法哉。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>佛誕日的聚訟</h3>
<p>— 亦人</p>
<p>關於佛敎方面的種種，我雖然一無心得，却極有眼福在報上看到什麽主持爭產，暗藏春色，再不然，又是什麽護國，息災，和平法會等，（現在八大行省正鬧得兇的災荒，不知是否還是這些法會的功績？）諸如此類的“佛法”，五花八門的眞是好看煞人！</p>
<p>阿彌陀佛，現在又有眼福讀到－條“釋尊成道及誕生日期，諸說紛歧，各民族間所訂之曆法，亦復不同，茲參照西藏，錫蘭，緬甸，暹羅，及各國慣例，擬以國曆五月月圓日（當夏曆四月十五日）為世界佛敎紀念日；惟我國向以夏曆四月初八日為釋尊降誕日；為全國遵奉，垂兩千年。本會未敢由少數人决定，故擬函各方大德同意後，電請班佛轉呈國府通令紀念，用特專函奉詢，務乞我公賜予詳為審核，並懇見復，至深企禱”云。</p>
<p>這條新聞自然沒有因爭產而鬧得頭破血流，或是在禪房裏抄出春藥瓶等來得香艷熱鬧。而且小子與佛無緣，實在也回答不出，（想不通的則是佛門信徒也居然會纏不淸佛祖誕日，而弄得“諸說紛歧”。）據各方緇素和居士們的主張呢，則也“紛歧”得很：“㊀應秉固有習慣，不必曲從他人主張；㊁仰體班禪大師之意，如其所擬辦理；㊂固有紀念日固應保持，班禪大師主張，亦應贊同，不妨在原有紀念日外，另定一新紀念日”。</p>
<p>這些主張好像各有理由，委實有趣可喜：小子旣非緇素，又非居士，并一本佛經也從未看過，話自然無從說起。不過從這三種主張中，却也可以看出中國人的處世哲學來，這却是想說一說的。自然那已經是與佛無涉了。</p>
<p>第一種人說，凡是“固有習慣”總是對的，所以“不必曲從他人主張”，這和“古已有之”說一加起來，也就是說越古越好，而這古也必須合於自己；第二種人則反之，他們相信權卽是力，所以“如其所擬辦理”，也就是“你老說的還會錯嗎，哈哈哈。”第三種人則更圓滑：“你老所說的不錯，不過‘固有習慣’總也得顧全，”所以“不妨以原有紀念日外，另定一新紀念日，”這樣，雙方都過得去。</p>
<p>這三種處世方式在這個世界上都容易立足，第一種雖然比較有些危險，但是有“固有習慣”可恃。“習慣”旣成“固有”，則其無礙於世也可知；不然，說得好聽點，不是早已遭“淘汰”了嗎？所以也不要緊。</p>
<p>處世方式中祇有認眞是最危險的，其罪狀，卽“標新立異”是也。譬如佛祖誕日，我想總不會沒有人想到考查一下佛祖究竟诞生於何日的，但因為太麻煩，並且說不定還會查出第三個日期來，需得另起爐灶。於是深於世故者，遂或以“固有習慣”，或以抑體上峯來作安身立命之道了。</p>
<p>因為這樣，才有飯吃，也才有好飯吃也。</p>
<h3>巡迴施敎車</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>巡迴施敎車，是江蘇省立鎭江民衆敎育館所創製的，它在前天繼由本市中國汽車公司製造完成，昨天特在南市文廟公園公開表演，當時我便去參觀了一回。</p>
<p>它是利用電化施敎來普及內地民衆敎育的一種新工具，在我們中國却還是創見。因為它不特裝置新穎，而且設備也非常周至。</p>
<p>該車的車身很高，用柴油發動，那油光碧綠的顏色上，寫着許多紅色的標語字，似乎覺得格外鮮艷奪目。車頭上，“巡迴施敎車”的牌子傍邊有“實行新生活，革除舊習慣”的一副聯語，後面車棚上也有“可觀可聽又學又做”及兩傍“採用電影電播，統一全民思想，”等標語，車的兩側面頂欄上，更綴着“演者如敎師，觀者如學生，聽者如上課，幻影等於實物。”和“銀幕代黑板，映書代課本，播音代口授，廣塲有如講堂。”等倣宋體字。</p>
<p>據說他們的工作分為八點，如：舉行中心展覽，實施流動演講，介紹標準國貨，代攝大衆相片，流通大衆讀物，灌輸科學智識，電播時事消息，開映敎育影片等。車廂里的佈置也很精緻，沙發的坐椅，柏木的長檯，播音機台，都極齊整，正中央有黨國旗和總理遺像及遺囑，左右分縣着林主席和蔣委員長像，兩邊的車壁上却掛着古今科學家，敎育家以及古代聖賢和民族英雄的圖像。此外，還有科學化學醫學圖書等之設備。車里有會議室，可容十六人，是備以供鄕村里鄕鎭保甲長開會用的，而大宗的書籍也可流通借閱，祇以書價作押，並未收取手續費，至於代攝照片也只收軟片代價。所有工作人員之衣飾敎具膳宿等，更完全在這車廂里面，這簡直有點像是一個小型的民衆敎育館。車頂上也可佈置各種裝飾，像長檯，長櫈，旗杆，播音機，電影放映機等，所以在大庭廣衆之問可以作為演講台或主席台，並且能夠升旗，頭頂可以撑大傘，以避雨露。車前能裝鐵梗，需要開放電影時，祇須將鐵梗裝上，伸展至相當距離，繃上了一方幕布，便好放映電影了。並且車的四周都裝有擴聲機，全塲遠近聽台上人演講說話歌唱都非常淸晰，四面也裝有四百支光電燈四隻，在鄕村里黑夜也可施敎。</p>
<p>又據該車上負責者劉君告訴我，他們這車子不但在交通發達的公路上可以行駛，就是交通不十分便利的地方也能夠通行無阻：因為車上的－切東西都可裝卸，在鄕村小路及汽車所不能行走的地方，祇須－件一件地拆了下來，呌人挑或用船裝運，也是十分便利的。</p>
<p>車上的服務人員，除劉君外，尚有職員，醫生，機匠，工役等四人，他們在可能範圍內，都誠懇地為民衆效勞。而該車除了播音機，電影機，攝影機等中國尚無製造外，一切完全採用國貨。</p>
<p>現該車尚係第一輛在中國出現，聽說在不久的將來，在全中國內都會有這電化施敎的普及民衆敎育的工具出現了。</p>

<h3>做了一天嚮導員</h3>
<p>— 朱麗英</p>
<p>我很淸楚地知道“嚮導員”在上海已經變成了什麽模樣，但是許許多多我們的同伴為了生活，竟然自願地墮入那黑暗的地獄，而做着所謂漂亮的“嚮導員”了。我想在這許多可憐的人們中間，有一部份據說是被人拐賣來的，自然她們已經沒有支配自己身體的自由主權了。而其他，就像我自己，至少也讀過幾年書，而且淸楚地知道“嚮導員”所過着的非人生活，終後還是投到這黑暗的地獄里去，你能說這是我自己甘願墮落嗎？吃飽了肚皮的人，他們始終不知道挨餓的難受；為了錢，人類就永遠被分隔在二個不同的世界里。</p>
<p>現在我告訴你們我怎樣開始我的嚮導員生活的，雖然祇有一天。說起來或許像其他不幸的同伴一樣，我生長在一個窮困的家庭里，但是父親要能多活幾年的話，也不至於到這樣悲慘的局面。他是一個公家機關里的小職員，他自己拚命省衣節食，維持一家三口之外，就扶植我去讀書，為了我的讀書，母親不知和他拌過多少回嘴。母親果然有她自己的想頭，以為窮人家的女孩子讀了書有什麽用處。父親却堅决着孩子一定要讀書的，不問他是男是女。邀天之倖，我總算讀完了初中，但是父親到底積勞成疾和我母女二人分手了。之後，要想繼續讀書當然是不可能了，而且我應該馬上擔負家庭的生活費。我竟然毫不費力地找到了一個小學敎員的職位。有了三十元一月的進欵，母女二個也夠苦度光陰了。不過你們也知道，上海的弄堂學校是一種什麽局面，起初二個月還能按月支到薪水，以後却就不客氣了，校長常常避不見面，卽使見到了，隨你說得怎樣困難，他抽起一支烟捲，始終給你一個不睬。能夠偶然由他分發一元，或幾毛錢，那是一個月里碰不到一回的。</p>
<p>做了一學期敎員，拿到二個月薪水，和二塊錢的“特賞”。父親死的時候又沒有留下一塊錢，這半年的苦况也可想而知了。下學期我自然脫離了那個學校，可是以後找職業就沒有你想像的便利了。這中間也做過一家公館裏的保姆，又不幸男主人是別有用心的。其他看來是很漂亮的所謂“婦女職業”也都嚇得我沒有三天二天退了回來…終於逼着嘗試做嚮導員了。</p>
<p>說起來也是受了廣告的欺騙，說是有一家糖菓公司聘請幾位女推銷員的，可是按照廣告上的地址前去應徵的時候，我就知道又是滑頭性質的了。那家糖菓公司在一家裁縫舖的樓上，一進門，就見一桌女人在那里打雀牌，有一個年輕的滑頭小伙子對我相了一眼，便問我是不是應徵來的.我點點頭，他馬上老實告訴我這里是嚮導社。照我先前的脾氣，早巳回頭就跑了。那時候，一則已經到了無路可走的地步，而且也想看看嚮導社的內幕情形，由他問了姓名，籍貫等後，便毫不疑遲地在他交給我的一張合同上簽了字。他要我下一天上“寫字間”。</p>
<p>那些可憐的同伴們到是很和氣的，她們告訴我許多應付客人的“門檻”。平時在報上讀到我們的同伴受侮辱的新聞，起初以為兩方面都應該負一點責任的，現在覺得那些“客人”眞是太可怕了，他們完全把我們看做另外一等女人的。</p>
<p>那一天有一位同伴請假，有客人打電話來指定她的時候，那位滑頭小伙子（原來他就是老闆）就馬上介紹我，用一種贊美貨品介紹詞，在電話裏告訴人家：“有一位新來的，是中學畢業生……交關嶄！包儂靈！”你們想想，這成什麽話？</p>
<p>那位客人還算老實，問了我許多關於學校的情形，大概他想試探我是不是中學生，坐了兩個多鐘頭，他給了我五塊錢。後來知道因為他是請假的同伴底“老客人”，他不敢對我怎樣免得引起麻煩，這眞是天曉得！</p>
<p>交賬的時候，我老實告訴他們拿到五塊錢，那老闆笑笑，祇要我交三塊錢，二塊是我的“外快”，社里是不問這些事的。當天晚上，老闆要我去跳舞，他說做了嚮導員會跳舞的可以佔便宜，他願意敎我，因為一個嚮導社里有一位中學生是很出風頭的。但是到了跳舞塲里他就換了一付面目，他强迫喝酒，跳舞的時侯故意說一些油話，而且一點也不規矩地摟着我，看他樣子眞是不曉得存着什麽壤念頭！到了十二點鐘我一定要走了，他還不肯放我，他說今天的五塊錢不是他特別帮我忙的嗎，好樣我應該服從他的威迫，作為酬報。</p>
<p>我總算見識這黑暗地獄的眞面目了，我們不但要受“客人”的侮辱，同時那些吸我們汗血的魔鬼也處處在佈置天羅地網來做他們的俘虜！</p>
<p>第二天我不敢再去了。我現在又徘徊在“十字街頭”。到什麽地方去呢？</p>
<h3>故鄕的枇杷</h3>
<p>— 田靑</p>
<p>春光殘了，這時候有一縷悠悠的情意，把我牽迴於故鄕的庭園，尤其是那棵我親手種植的杷枇。</p>
<p>故鄕是容易見到夏天的，故鄕的枇杷也隨着夏天這熱情而快樂的姑娘而早熟了。當這春殘花老的時候，不論在果樹園裏，在原野裏，陌上路旁，到處都展露着枇杷矯勁的英姿。那過度闊綠而多毛的叢葉襯托着軟黃的佳果，像煞是深藍的天空裏的星星——它逕引了無數羨慕的月光和貪饞的涎沫。</p>
<p>是的，枇杷是可愛的。它有着獨特的個性——它不辛酸，也不給人以過度的甜蜜。它有如原野裏樸實的少女，恬靜而且溫存。枇杷的花在純靜而帶有輕柔的香味，漿汁是有沁人的淸甜的。在秋風蕭殺裏它蓓蕾了；鬥着嚴冬的風霜舒開了化朶；迎着初春溫暖的風結實了。我愛枇杷，我會親手栽種過；在故居的前庭，我寄托了它的生命。</p>
<p>是在中學的時候，那棵我親手栽植的小樹，嘗試地為我孕育了。我的心花跟枇杷的花同時開放了，我的歡欣被每－個動作，每一句言語所漏泄了。然而我躭心着這麽嬌小的軀幹，結不成優美的果實，於是更小心地加肥，灌漑，盡可能地帮助它吸收養料。不論是淸晨或者是黃昏，沒有一次我不歡欣地分開多毛的闊葉，撫摸每一球的果實，每一粒水果。𨯿定那一球是最優美的，那一粒小果的生長最快。瞧着那纍纍的新果，就像瞧着最親愛的人，將為着我們的情愛而生育的那麽快活。潛意識裏的歡意，又常常被殘春的夢洩露了。</p>
<p>隨着時季的轉換，果實是脫下翠玉般暗綠的舊衣，顯出軟柔柔的鵝黃色的新裝:這簡直像一朶朶鮮艷的薔薇在我心中舒放了，除掉自己，沒有誰明白得這顆心是多麽美麗與快活。</p>
<p>為着過度的愛情，又仿傚人家經營果樹園的方法：用紗布包紥所有的果實，避免鳥雀的損害。這時候我不能探出它們是在慶幸它們的安全呢？是懊惱自私的我使它們不見天日的憂鬱？也許它們是驕傲主人的寵愛；可是我自己却憤恨着世界上怎麽會有損害別人生長的動物，硬生生地使我和它們隔離。</p>
<p>每日的黃昏，我都小心地解開包扎的紗布，逐一地撫摸，逐一地審視，注意它們這一天的生長狀况，然後又像慈愛的母親侍候嬰兒的睡眠那麽小心地逐一包扎來。習慣地倚在它的身邊：現在我是做着帶有憂鬱性的幻夢。同時也考慮着誰是享受我這最香甜的果實的人！</p>
<p>一陣突然的匪亂，騙我們向異鄕逃亡。我那親愛的小樹，我那卽將成熟的甜果，我的家鄕的一切，都淪為別人的所有，我的－顆歡樂的心，不禁暗然了</p>
<p>三年以後我第一次回到故鄕，撫摸着那棵可愛的手植的小樹——不，它已經有了蠻大而矯健的軀幹，昂然地突出於籬落之間。可是它身上被帶的槍彈和刀砍的創傷，是明白地記載着匪亂的痕跡。</p>
<p>十年來我到處飄浮，很少有會見故鄕的機會，縱有也難逢枇杷盛熟的時，甚至它的開花結蕊，也不讓我瞧瞧。可是我有三千里外悵望着故鄕的危局，更懷戀我那甜蜜的伴侶——枇杷——幾時會呌我再嘗到它的甜意和蜜味！</p>
<h3>冷落的埠頭</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>埠頭是張大了口，口是針對着那條狹的河流。</p>
<p>“埠頭冷落了！”</p>
<p>十餘年了，從一個中年婦人而至目前的老乞婆，這過程在她的記憶裏是容易抓得到的，有個時期的繁榮，老乞婆並且多上了積蓄。</p>
<p>現實的衰落是使人驚駭的，以往賺有重利息的昌興米行，雖然還是支着個冷冷的塲面。小夥計閒得打起瞌睡來了；掌櫃的揑了支水烟管，獃望看埠頭出神。</p>
<p>“世界變了嗎”</p>
<p>果眞，載米船幾乎絕了跡。如果有一艘兩艘的發現，埠頭上的鱗甲就活躍起來了。</p>
<p>埠頭的冷落，連河水也像永遠靜止樣的不縐一些漪漣。</p>

<p>Japanese Side Becomes Increasingly Indifferent Due to New Mine</p>
<p>[Beiping] The issue of restoring the Longyan Iron Mine has been repeatedly contacted by Chinese and Japanese parties for a cooperation plan for half a year, but no results have been achieved. It is rumored that the Japanese side is no longer as eager to resume operations at the Longyan Mine as before. The reason is that the Japanese side recently discovered a treasure near the Anshan Mine that is equivalent to that mine and plans to fully develop it. The Hebei and Chahar authorities have ordered specialists to draft a plan, preparing to raise funds locally and operate independently after the Japanese side gives up cooperation.

He buried himself in his studies and was not afraid of difficulties or dangers. His spirit of tireless work is worthy of our emulation. Mr. Chen was most strongly opposed to Yuan Shikai, so Yuan was most afraid of him and decided to assassinate him. Mr. Chen was murdered by Yuan on this day 21 years ago. Furthermore, Mr. Chen treated his comrades with the utmost care and concern throughout his life, which was unmatched. We should also emulate him.

<h3>Central Government and Other Banks Add Supplementary Measures for Exchanging Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Already Requested the Executive Yuan to Forward to the National Government for Record</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance, in order to rapidly promote legal tender, has repeatedly sent official letters to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, urging them to step up the collection of silver coins, so as to consider the exchange situation in various places, and to order the cessation of exchange at any time and place. However, the four banks have not yet completed this mission, for two reasons: first, the people have to bear considerable expenses for carrying, exchanging, transporting, and packaging silver coins, but the banks have no regulations for paying these fees, so they are unwilling to exchange directly with the banks; second, the people's silver coins are often detained by military and police agencies when they carry them for exchange, so they dare not exchange directly with the banks. In order to complete this mission of collecting silver coins as soon as possible, the four banks, after consultation, have drafted a method of issuing vouchers for full face value in silver, and sent it to the Issuing Reserve Management Committee to request the Ministry of Finance for approval. The Ministry of Finance believes that the proposed method should be approved and implemented, and the name of the method should be changed to Supplementary Measures for Exchanging Legal Tender. The content has also been revised appropriately. It has now been sent to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China for implementation. At the same time, it has also been submitted to the Executive Yuan to forward to the National Government for record, and a telegram has been sent to the Military Affairs Commission to instruct all military agencies to comply with it, and other agencies have been informed to take note of it. The supplementary measures for exchanging legal tender are as follows: ㊀ In order to facilitate the exchange of legal tender by the people, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, in addition to the original method of issuing vouchers for silver coins and banknotes at a ratio of 4:6, which will still be handled as before, if ordinary commercial firms, companies, or individuals exchange legal tender for silver coins at face value at the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, the four banks may give a handling fee at their discretion, as a fee for transportation, packaging, etc., limited to six yuan per hundred yuan. ㊁ The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China should report to the Ministry for verification on a regular basis the amount of silver coins collected for exchanging legal tender at face value and the amount of handling fees paid in advance. The handling fees paid in advance will be reimbursed by the Ministry when the case is closed. ㊂ All silver coin businesses, ordinary commercial firms, companies, or individuals who carry silver coins to the four banks or other entrusted agencies to exchange for legal tender, except for those along the coast and border areas that should be inspected by the customs to prevent smuggling, all military and police agencies in all places should immediately check the telegram from the Ministry of Finance on April 27, 1936, to protect them and not intercept them. If there is any violation, the people should be allowed to accuse them and they should be strictly investigated and punished. (Central News Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>

After the death was reported and verified, the bodies were buried, but the cost of the car and labor was too high, so they were discarded in the Haihe River, allowing them to float away. Later, they handed over a bamboo pole used to carry the corpses as evidence. The municipal government has ordered the police station to interrogate the two suspects strictly. The two Tians are specifically responsible for picking up and burying dead bodies on land in the Japanese Concession. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Librarians of Peiping Library Steal Copies of Rare Books</h3>
<p>Yuan Jiaoli Talks; Absolutely Not True</p>
<p>[Beiping] Regarding the matter of two or three librarians of the Peiping Library compiling an abstract of the Sequel to the Siku Quanshu for the Oriental Cultural Enterprise Committee, and stealing copies and photographing rare books, Yuan Dunli, the curator of the library, recently issued a statement saying that although two or three staff members of the library had participated in the compilation of the abstract of the Siku Quanshu for the Oriental Cultural Enterprise Committee, they have already left the relationship. As for the matter of librarians privately stealing, copying, photographing, and selling rare books for outsiders, it is absolutely not true. The library is a cultural institution and is purely open in nature. Over the years, many domestic academic institutions and scholars have entrusted it to transcribe rare books, so the library has many scribes who specialize in transcription. However, the transcription of any book must first be approved and permitted by the curator. Also, Hu Shi said that in the past, one or two lecturers had compiled several abstracts of specialized bibliographies for the Oriental Cultural Enterprise Committee, but they had accepted the advice of friends and no longer continued.

<h3>On the National Defense Line (6)</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Shu Di</p>
<p>(IV) "Is Shanxi a Mystery"?</p>
<p>The night before I set off, I was at a restaurant with friends, talking about my upcoming trip on the national defense line. Then, a friend scratched his head and frowned, saying:</p>
<p>"Shanxi? Shanxi?! In recent years, the situation in Shanxi has really been a mystery to us."</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived in Taiyuan, I kept asking my friends one question after another, all kinds of questions that had been accumulating in my stomach. This anxious expression often made them laugh. So once, Mr. Bo Youcheng, the secretary director of the General Corps of the Advocating Justice Group, laughed and said to me:</p>
<p>"You outsiders probably see Shanxi as a mystery, right?"</p>
<p>Actually, it's not necessarily that outsiders see Shanxi as a mystery; however, in recent years, Shanxi has become the front line of our national defense. On the one hand, the people of the whole country are paying more attention to it; on the other hand, the hard work and facilities that the Shanxi authorities are intensifying have also attracted the attention of the people of the whole country. Everyone is concerned about the situation in Shanxi, paying attention to the trends in Shanxi, hoping to understand its true nature and see its full picture; but between their concern and attention, and their understanding and seeing clearly, there is always a considerable distance, making it impossible for them to achieve their goals for a while. This distance has caused the various situations in Shanxi to arouse a feeling close to a "mystery" in the minds of outsiders.</p>
<p>After I returned to Shanxi for this trip, the above-mentioned distance has become non-existent for me. I dare not say that I have completely understood Shanxi; but in the general outline, I have at least cleared up the feeling of a "mystery". Here, let's first talk about what caused the "mystery" feeling for everyone?</p>
<p>First of all, we should pay attention to its geographical environment. In terms of natural terrain, the east, west, and north sides are almost completely surrounded by mountains. The Taihang Mountains winding in the east, the Lüliang Mountains in the west, and the Wutai Mountains, Heng Mountains, etc. in the north, plus the Yellow River in the south, almost create a natural barrier for Shanxi. Therefore, the traffic to the outside must take Yanmen Pass as the general gateway, and in the east, Niangzi Pass must be the general gateway. If these two passes are blocked, then the situation will truly present a phenomenon of being closed off from the world. The past twenty years or so have been a transitional stage for China from the old autocratic political unity to the new democratic republican political unity. Therefore, long-term struggles, constant civil wars, and revolutions that rise and fall are all inevitable phenomena. Shanxi has never been involved in the vortex of these civil wars, revolutions, and struggles. This, on the one hand, can be said to be due to the Shanxi authorities' proper response to the environment; on the other hand, the biggest reason is due to the obstruction of the terrain. Shanxi has not suffered from the disaster of civil war in the past twenty years, which is its advantage; however, in terms of integration with the outside world, it is much worse than the provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast.</p>
<p>Speaking of the traffic situation, the traffic facilities in Shanxi can be said to be very developed. Long before other provinces began to build highways on a large scale, its territory was already covered with motor vehicle roads. However, as mentioned above, the traffic to other provinces only has two general gateways, Yanmen Pass and Niangzi Pass, in the north and east.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>On Revising the Salt Law</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>In recent years, central government expenditures have been increasing day by day. The national revenue has to increase accordingly. The financial authorities are planning to raise debts and increase taxes, all in order to balance revenue and expenditure. Since April of this year, the tax rates of various consolidated taxes have been changed. In addition to the regular salt tax, a construction special fund of one yuan per picul has been added. Recently, there has been news of a proposal to revise the salt law, proposing to change the tax unit of "kilogram" to "market" kilogram. Although there is only a difference of one word on the surface, the tax rate is more than doubled. It is not yet known whether this matter will be successfully passed in the Legislative Yuan in the future. Now, I will briefly discuss it based on my limited knowledge.</p>
<p>The new salt law promulgated in May 1931 was originally scheduled to be implemented gradually before the end of 1936. The reason why it has not yet been realized is, in our imagination, that there are two obstacles: the obstruction of the old salt merchants and the concern that tax revenue will be reduced. However, the occurrence of these two obstacles is enough to show the rationality of the new salt law. The new salt law stipulates that taxes should be levied at the salt fields, and that the salt should be allowed to go wherever it is needed after the tax is paid. This will destroy the old system of salt licenses and allow the supply and demand of edible salt to be balanced. At the same time, the tax rates are unified, and it is stipulated that five yuan should be levied per 100 kilograms (three yuan for fishing salt), and no additional taxes should be levied. All the accumulated ills of the past salt tax are swept away. All of these are the essence of the new salt law. Its biggest purpose is to eliminate salt merchants and reduce the burden of salt tax on the people.</p>
<p>Today, the financial authorities not only demand an increase in the tax rate of the new salt law, but also have doubts about the policy of "allowing the salt to go wherever it is needed after the tax is paid." For example, in the recent salt affairs inspection report of Zeng Yangfeng, the salt affairs director, the freedom of the new salt law was considered to be problematic. (See the May 1st issue of this newspaper) According to Zeng's reasons, there are about three points: ㊀ "Allowing the salt to go wherever it is needed" will inevitably lead to the rampant smuggling of salt. ㊁ Domestic transportation is inconvenient, and the transportation and sale of salt must rely on the government's regulation. ㊂ Levying taxes at the salt fields at one time will make the capital of the merchants only able to operate half of the business, and tax revenue will be affected. These three points may not be accurate. The rampant smuggling of salt has nothing to do with the nature of free transportation and sale, but is a matter of the effectiveness of smuggling suppression. As for the inconvenience of transportation that can affect the transportation and sale of goods, most of them are not necessary items. As for salt, people cannot do without it. The elasticity of demand is extremely small. Moreover, under free market, any merchant can compete in transportation and sale. From the merchant's point of view, they only seek profit. From the consumer's point of view, they only seek to purchase at a price within their means. Although the mountains are blocked, trade is unimpeded. There is no need for the government's regulation. As for the third reason, we also have doubts. Under the current system of salt licenses, there is only one salt merchant in one area. Therefore, the one-time levying of taxes may lead to the phenomenon of capital stagnation. However, under the premise of the new salt law's free transportation and sale, merchants are not limited to one, and capital is not limited to one set. Even if one set of capital can only operate half of the business, it should not affect tax revenue.</p>
<p>What is more, according to the new salt law, salt tax is absolutely not allowed to be added. However, according to the current situation, local surcharges on salt tax are often heard of. Can the central government make it effective immediately? Even the central government itself, does it have the determination and possibility to resolutely cancel the surcharge? In the past two months, such as the new railway construction surcharge of 50 cents in Guangdong, and the new construction special fund surcharge of one yuan levied by the central government. It can be asserted that this kind of new levy is difficult to abolish immediately.</p>
<p>In short, the new salt law has three characteristics: first, the abolition of salt merchants; second, the reduction of salt tax; and third, the cessation of surcharges. And these three have an inseparable connection and should not be dismembered and divided. However, judging from the current affairs, the tax rate cannot be reduced, salt merchants cannot be completely abolished, and surcharges are difficult to stop. If the new salt law is revised to accommodate this situation, then its essence will be completely lost. Why should we value this kind of new salt law?</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Kong Speaks at a British Church School on the Pioneers of New Education in China</h3>
<p>Hope to Work Harder to Improve; Our People Will Cooperate</p>
<p>[London] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy of China participating in the coronation ceremony of the King of England, attended a banquet of the Joint Committee of Chinese Church Universities at the Florence Hotel at noon today and delivered a speech, praising the achievements of Christianity in China and its impact on China. (Note: The Joint Committee of Chinese Church Universities represents the various churches in England and jointly presides over the various Chinese church universities with the local churches in China and the various churches in North America.) He said that the Chinese government does not impose restrictions on education based on differences in nationality, race, religion, or class. The undertakings carried out by Christianity in China not only have educational and religious qualities, but also greatly benefit the promotion of international friendship. He then recalled the long history of a certain Protestant church in China, saying, "In terms of modern education, the churches are the pioneers of new education in China. Although China has been turbulent for many years in the past, the churches have still been able to hold high the torch of modern knowledge and religious belief, illuminating the whole country. The Chinese people have always valued freedom of belief. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Kuomintang, was a Christian and studied at a church school. In addition, there are many leaders from all walks of life in our country who studied at church schools in their early years, and there are also those who have been influenced by church friends and converted to Christianity. General Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan, is one example. Chiang Kai-shek's wife is the most vigorous advocate of the New Life Movement and has also been enlightened by the Christian church. In short, church education is an important factor in the Chinese reform movement, which has been generally recognized. If the responsible authorities of the various churches can have a broader mind and a more farsighted vision, then the work they carry out will definitely achieve greater success. Fortunately, in recent years, the Christian church has taken a further step and expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Chinese authorities, so that the various churches can become truly Chinese churches. This is truly gratifying. We should welcome and wish prosperity to all churches that are willing to devote themselves fully and adapt to the wishes of our people. I firmly believe that our people will be able to cooperate with them." Kong then explained his personal experience in assisting church schools, saying that the Chinese budget in the past few years had allocated funds to subsidize the various church schools. "Before I conclude this speech, I have one more word to tell you: Chinese church schools still have a mission to accomplish, which is to introduce Chinese culture to European and American countries." (Havas News Agency telegram from London on the 18th)</p>
<p>[London] The Joint Board of Directors of Christian Universities gave a public banquet to Special Envoy Kong today. Kong delivered a speech on the spot, praising the valuable contributions made by Christian schools in China, saying that Christian schools in China have a long history and have achieved remarkable results. In the new era of education, church schools are pioneers. Today, the level of students in Christian universities is on par with that of independent Chinese universities. Many schools have absorbed a large number of outstanding male and female students in China. Christian schools also have valuable contributions in matters such as social well-being. During the eventful period of the Chinese national revival, Christian schools held high the torch of bright truth, new knowledge, and religious belief. This kind of good work is recognized by all Chinese people with broad minds and progressive ideas. Kong continued to list many Chinese leaders as Christians, and said that he must give appropriate trust to Christian schools, but these schools must also understand that there is still room for improvement and progress. In recent years, Christian schools have gradually expressed their willingness to cooperate with the Chinese authorities. In the future, these schools will become truly independent Chinese schools. Kong praised the foreign teachers who came to China to teach for their selfless spirit of service and the foreign friends who provided financial assistance to these schools.

<p>[Rome] Following Foreign Minister Count Ciano's moderate remarks on Anglo-Italian relations in the Chamber of Deputies on the 14th of this month, Italy's attitude towards England has become closer to Germany's attitude towards England. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Ciano held talks with British Ambassador Sir Drummond yesterday, discussing improvements in the relationship between the press. The recent criticisms of Italy by British newspapers have been one of the causes of the deterioration in Anglo-Italian relations. This is why the Italian government recalled its journalists stationed in England and banned British newspapers from entering the country. Therefore, if Anglo-Italian relations are to be improved, the relationship between the press must be improved. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Newspapers here are paying close attention to the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and British Ambassador to Italy Drummond. According to the Rome correspondent of The Times, the two discussed the attitude of their respective newspapers. The Daily Telegraph reported that an understanding had been reached on the Western European Pact during the meeting between the foreign minister and the British ambassador. Other issues discussed included the expulsion of Abyssinia from the League of Nations and the recognition of the Italian Empire. The News Chronicle reported that the Abyssinian delegation will not be able to attend the next League of Nations Assembly, but this does not deprive them of their right to make future claims. (18th, National Maritime Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] According to reports here, the attacks on Britain by the Italian press have ceased due to the improvement in relations between the two countries. At the same time, the Italian press's indifferent attitude towards the coronation ceremony of the British King has also changed, and they have recently begun to publish news of various activities in London. In addition, the News Chronicle's Rome correspondent, who was previously expelled, has now been allowed to continue to reside there, which is deeply satisfying. (18th, National Maritime Telegram)</p>

<p>⊙ Monts, France: Rogers announced the wedding date of the former King of England, the Duke of Windsor, and Mrs. Warfield today. At that time, there were strong winds and heavy rain, and farmers were crying out in distress, calling it an ominous sign. One hundred and eighty journalists from various countries braved the rain to attend. Someone jokingly told the Duke of Windsor about the farmers' concerns, and the Duke replied with a smile, "The wedding day will surely see the heavens shine brightly." (18th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] After the former King of England, the Duke of Windsor, and Mrs. Simpson are married, they will move to Carinthia, Austria, to reside at Schloss Wasserleonburg.

<p>[Washington] The Associated Press obtained secret information today, revealing that the U.S. Army has completed a new air defense plan that will completely transform current aerial defense. While the Army Department remains silent on this news, it is understood that the plan involves the Army deploying two anti-aircraft gun teams, located far apart. Each team has sensitive audio equipment. Once an aircraft is detected, the electrically controlled guns will be activated, and each gun will automatically aim at the enemy aircraft and fire accurately. (17th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Nine-Member Cabinet Formed in Spain</h3>
<p>Naval, Land, and Air Departments Merged into Ministry of National Defense; Two Major Labor Unions Do Not Participate in the New Cabinet</p>
<p>⊙ Valencia: Former Finance Minister Negrín, leader of the moderate Socialist Party, formed a new cabinet today, which includes three members of the Socialist Party, two members of the Communist Party, one member of the Catalan Republican Left, and one member of the Basque Nationalist Party. It is noteworthy that former Prime Minister Caballero did not participate. In addition, neither the anarchist party nor the General Confederation of Labor has representatives. Negrín continues to serve as Minister of Finance, Republican Giral succeeds as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and former Minister of the Navy and Air Force Prieto is appointed Minister of National Defense. This department is newly established, merging the three departments of Navy, Land, and Air. In fact, Prieto is now the de facto dictator of the government's military operational policies. (18th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Negrín, 48 years old, is a biology professor at the University of Madrid. He served as Minister of Finance in the Caballero Cabinet. This time, he was appointed to form a cabinet and continues to serve as Minister of Finance. The number of cabinet members was originally fifteen, but this time it has been reduced to nine. The most important changes are that former Prime Minister Caballero and former Foreign Minister Vayo did not join the cabinet this time. Also, Bastião, the former Speaker of the Parliament, who rushed back from London, is not among the cabinet members. (18th, National Maritime Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙ Valencia: Former Finance Minister Negrín has formed a new cabinet as follows: Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Negrín (Socialist), Minister of Foreign Affairs Giral (Republican Left), Minister of National Defense Prieto (Socialist), Minister of Interior Pescadero (Socialist), Minister of Justice Irujo (Basque Nationalist Party), Minister of Education and Health Haintaisti (Communist), Minister of Agriculture Uribe (Communist), Minister of Public Works and Transportation Rios (United Republican Party), Minister of Social Affairs Aigad (Catalan Autonomous Region Left). It appears that all parties belonging to the Popular Front have sent representatives, but it is noteworthy that the anarchist National Confederation of Labor and the socialist Workers' General Union do not hold cabinet seats. The Propaganda Department has been merged into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and renamed the Information Division. The new Prime Minister Negrín, 48 years old, was formerly a professor of physiology at the University of Madrid and is an expert in economics. Since being elected as a member of the House of Representatives, he has made many contributions to financial and economic issues. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian King Accompanies Foreign Minister on Reciprocal Visit to Hungary</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome in the Hungarian Capital</p>
<p>[Rome] King Vittorio Emanuele III and the Queen, accompanied by Foreign Minister Count Ciano and many attendants, departed for the Hungarian capital this morning at 10:30 to make a reciprocal visit. Many Italian and Hungarian dignitaries, such as Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Bastianini and the Hungarian Minister and military attaché, were at the station to see them off. The press car departed first at 10:10, and the royal train followed twenty minutes later. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[Rome] Newspapers here have published lengthy articles describing the enthusiastic preparations for the welcome in the Hungarian capital, and explaining that the friendship between Italy and Hungary has been long-standing. Italy has always supported Hungary's demands for the revision of the post-World War I treaties, for which Hungary is grateful. As for what issues Italy and Hungary will discuss this time, the newspapers have not mentioned anything. Observers generally believe that Italian officials have always claimed that they would "fight for justice for Hungary," but now the newspapers do not mention it at all, probably because Italy has just signed a political and economic agreement with Yugoslavia and hopes to get closer to Romania. Therefore, it is inconvenient to insist too much on Hungary's demand to revise its borders, so as not to hinder Italy's relations with Yugoslavia and Romania.

<h3>Strengthening Combat Power: Soviet Union Unifies Military Authority</h3>
<p>Orders Each Military District to Organize a Council, Directly Responsible to the Minister of National Defense</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union have passed and promulgated the regulations on the military councils of the land and naval military districts. The regulations stipulate that each military district should establish a military council, composed of the commander of the garrison and two other members. All troops and military organs within the district are under the jurisdiction of the council. Each military council is directly responsible to the People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union. (17th, TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government issued a decree today to establish military councils in all land and naval military districts across the country. This is the first step in the announced measures to strengthen control over the Red Army. Each council is subordinate to the highest military authority in each military district. In Moscow, there is a supreme military council, jointly chaired by the People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov and two senior officials of the Party Central Committee. According to today's decree, the purpose of this supreme military council is to implement military and political training in the army, supervise the appointment and removal of officers, instill Party indoctrination, eliminate all spies and corrupt elements who harm the people, as well as other dangerous elements, and to plan the overall mobilization of the Soviet Union in peacetime. The work of the military councils in each district is to "prepare for the rapid mobilization of the Soviet Union," as well as to organize the people to provide military training, to handle water and land transportation for the army, and to undertake other tasks related to national mobilization. (18th, National Maritime Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Military Commission, authorized by an order signed by Chairman Kalinin of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Chairman Molotov of the Council of People's Commissars, has been granted extraordinary powers. To facilitate rapid militarization, three-member committees have been established in each military district to allow the government to control them. These committees, composed of the army commander and two appointed members, have supreme authority over the military affairs of the district and may requisition people and military supplies. All defensive and non-defensive engineering works and educational institutions related to military equipment are under the control of the committee. The military commander appointed by the committee is directly responsible to the Commissar of Defense Voroshilov, which proves that the opinions of Voroshilov and Stalin are in complete harmony.

<h3>Britain Supports Australia's Proposal for a Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>But Doubts Whether an Agreement Can Be Reached in the Near Future</p>
<p>[London] A Reuters reporter interviewed Australian Prime Minister Lyons today. Lyons did not want to explain the proposal he made at the opening of the Imperial Conference for the Pacific countries to conclude a non-aggression pact, but said that the proposal would be discussed in detail by the Imperial Conference Committee. Any concrete invitation to convene a Pacific conference should be issued by Britain, as it would be more appropriate than being issued by an overseas dominion. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph published an editorial today on the matter of convening a conference of Pacific countries, stating that this move is welcomed here no less than in Australia, and even more so. However, a Pacific agreement is not very likely in the near future. The United States will inevitably be an indispensable part of such an agreement, but friendly opinions in the United States believe that it is not yet the time. It is difficult for other countries to speculate on whether the United States is prepared to assume the obligations of resisting aggression in the Australian plan. The opening speech of the British Imperial Conference advocated the unity of the Empire and the full efforts of the British Isles and the interior of the Empire to manage world peace. The United States has expressed great sympathy for this, which is a welcome sign. The principle of cooperation among the free nations that make up the Empire is limitless. Their main purpose in foreign policy is peace, and they need to work diligently with countries of good will in economic and political affairs. (Central News Agency, 18th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙ Melbourne: According to today's "Melbourne Herald," it is expected here that Britain will invite countries related to the Pacific to discuss Australian Prime Minister Lyons' proposal to conclude a regional understanding and a non-aggression pact. The meeting place will likely be in Tokyo, and the participants will be Britain, the United States, China, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Russia, and France. At the opening of the British Imperial Conference in London last Friday, Lyons stated that Australia has a vital interest in the Pacific and welcomes regional understandings and non-aggression pacts based on the spirit of the League of Nations among Pacific countries. Australia is prepared to cooperate with other Pacific countries to establish such agreements in a spirit of understanding and sympathy. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Judicial Reform</h3>
<p>Meets Major Opposition; Will Accept Compromise</p>
<p>[Washington] It is confirmed today that President Roosevelt is willing to support a compromise at the appropriate time regarding the judicial reform plan and is willing to accept Senator Claren's counter-proposal, stipulating that only two judges be added. The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote tomorrow.

<h3>Soaring Prices in Japan: Countermeasures Studied</h3>
<p>Government Establishes Committee; First Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Temporary Price Countermeasures Committee, established by the government to suppress soaring prices and stabilize national life, held its first meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 this morning. Chairman Prime Minister Hayashi, Vice-Chairman Finance Minister Yuki, Commerce Minister Godo, and Agriculture Minister Yamazaki, as well as all committee members, attended. First, Chairman Hayashi delivered an opening address, then decided on the rules of procedure and formally began discussions. Finance Minister Yuki supplemented Chairman Hayashi's address and proposed countermeasures regarding the improvement of the rationing organization, means of consumption adjustment, international lending issues, and the supply and demand of funds related to price countermeasures, how they would affect consumers and workers in the future, and what kind of nature these countermeasures would have in social policy, requesting all committee members to express their opinions. Next, Commerce Minister Godo explained that the recent soaring prices were due to: ㊀ insufficient productivity, ㊁ insufficient production equipment and raw materials, and ㊂ production restrictions. Then, each committee member expressed their opinions separately, generally believing that the current high prices are a common phenomenon in foreign countries and are not limited to Japan. As for the reasons for the high prices, the most important is that the price of goods has already risen before they are imported into Japan, and it is natural to continue to rise after they are imported into Japan. In addition, tariffs also cause prices to be high, so as a result, everyone agreed that a small committee should be established first to study the reasons for rising prices. Finally, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry reported in detail on the trend of wholesale and retail prices, and the meeting adjourned at 12:40 in the afternoon. (18th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi delivered the following address at this morning's meeting of the Price Countermeasures Committee: The impact of recent price increases in our country is worrying. The government recognizes that it is an urgent task to immediately investigate the causes of rising prices and establish effective and appropriate countermeasures so that the national policy in this extraordinary situation can be carried out without being affected by it. Therefore, we have gathered knowledgeable people from the public and private sectors to establish this committee. Unlike previous committees of this kind, whose functions were only to consult and deliberate on proposals submitted by the government, this committee will serve as the basis for making proposals for the government. Therefore, I hope that all those present will not be bound by the formalities of the meeting and will freely express their opinions. If there are topics, those responsible should collect them and transfer them to a small committee composed of a few members for concrete deliberation and proposals, and then submit them to this committee for review, so as to establish appropriate and comprehensive price countermeasures suitable for all aspects. (18th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Yuki's Remarks</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the adjournment of the Price Countermeasures Committee, Finance Minister Yuki told people that the Price Countermeasures Committee was convened for the first time today and has not yet been fully discussed. A special committee will be convened once a week in the future, and the selection of committee members can also be decided at the second convening to handle committee affairs quickly. Many issues were discussed today, first of all, how to handle the urgent matter of the need and supply of iron, steel, and other metals. The second is the coal problem, and how to consider fuel resources in the future. Relations with China also need to be fundamentally studied. Although the currency issue does not currently pose a risk to prices, it is also a matter for thorough study in the future. Whether the relationship between distribution and supply should be reviewed in accordance with past economics and other old habits. Whether the Important Industries Control Law and other legislation related to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are appropriate in the current situation also needs to be reviewed. As for consumption, the people must conserve general consumption, which is considered extremely urgent in light of the circumstances. In this way, various issues must be convened separately in a special committee in order to plan, etc. (18th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Expresses Determination to Cling to Power</h3>
<p>He Vehemently Criticizes Political Parties' Tendency Towards Excessive Westernization, Stating It Is Unsuitable for Japan's National Character</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi, after the first day's meeting with local governors last night, hosted a banquet for all the governors at the Prime Minister's official residence, with government cabinet members in attendance. During the banquet, the Prime Minister delivered a speech, explaining his state of mind since the dissolution of the parliament until today, and expressing his belief in resisting the political parties' movement to overthrow the cabinet and in facing the current situation. The Prime Minister's speech was as follows:</p>
<p>Since forty years ago, I have often considered that the developmental trends of political parties are unsuitable for Japan's unique national spirit. Political parties forget Japan's original character and completely transform into European streams. According to the general theories of politics from the past, they adopt the common points of various countries in the world as the standard for measuring the development of Japan's political form. However, in my opinion, Japan is a special country, and this kind of standard cannot be met. Therefore, to apply the common theories of various countries in the world to the unique national character of Japan is a mistake. Looking at the parliament's situation, the government and the opposition party are in opposition, just like in various European countries, contending with antagonistic consciousness. During this critical situation, the political parties still maintain their two major parties' mutual contention and current state of mind, which is truly regrettable. Especially after the issue of requesting an extension of the parliament session, parliamentary deliberations have become even more sluggish. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the government and political parties to seriously deliberate. My intention in dissolving the parliament was not to reject or antagonize political parties, nor to attempt to prolong the cabinet's life or organize a new party. I dissolved the parliament hoping that political parties would gain the people's trust. I knew early on that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties would elect a majority of members. Therefore, as a result of the general election, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties obtained a majority of seats. I have no intention of resigning my position. If I resign now, it would lose the meaning of dissolving the parliament. It is my duty to observe whether the members of parliament have a sense of reflection after the general election. The saying that the political power should shift if the number of members of a certain party in the parliament increases is a Western idea. The government plans to establish a Cultural and Educational Deliberation Council to clarify the essence of the national character, study Japan's unique political form, and approach the special parliament with sincerity.

<h3>Albanian Rebellion Suppressed</h3>
<p>Another Italian Adventurous Move; Communist Background Not True</p>
<p>⊙Albanian Capital: Regarding the disturbances that occurred in the southeast, it is heard that government forces have already occupied the cities of Tepeleni and Argyrokastro without encountering resistance. Residents in these areas have warmly welcomed the government troops. (Seventeenth day, Havas dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the disturbances in southeastern Albania, a certain important person from that country, currently residing here, made a statement to the Petit Journal yesterday, claiming that the rebellion was actually a result of King Zog's policies, and that it was not caused by communist agitation. Albania only has farmers and small landowners, with no so-called working class, so there is no such thing as a communist party. Once the scope of the rebellion expands, a certain country will intervene. It goes without saying which country is referred to by "a certain country". (Eighteenth day, Havas from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the disturbances in southeastern Albania, the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, recently commented, believing that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now preparing another adventurous move. It said, "After Abyssinia and Spain, now Albania. It is hard to believe that this is a rebellion. It is also absurd to say that it was instigated by communists. The Italian government's desire to eliminate Albanian dissidents has been premeditated for some time. Now that the opportunity has arrived, it will naturally use the excuse of eliminating communists and saving Albania to provide support for King Zog I of that country."

<h3>Japan's 50 Million Yen in Cash</h3>
<p>Continue to Be Shipped to the United States in Batches</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In the past, in order to maintain the current level of exchange rates, the Japanese government has twice exported gold in cash, with the amount reaching approximately 100 million yuan. However, as a result of the implementation of the large budget, the import of foreign goods has a tendency to continue to increase. Therefore, in order to implement an effective exchange rate policy in the future, it is necessary to replenish foreign currency funds at this time. As a result of recent discussions between the Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Japan, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, it has been decided to make a third cash shipment of gold at the end of this month, amounting to approximately 50 million yuan. The shipping method is the same as the previous two times, and it will still be divided into three shipments, all of which will be shipped to the United States. (Eighteenth day, Domei dispatch)</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of Liu Luyin (Continued)</h3>
<p>At 1:20 PM, the court continued the trial in the first courtroom. The defendant Cheng Xie was brought in first. He was wearing a grass-green military uniform, a military cap, and shackles. The bailiff escorted him to the courtroom. The presiding judge asked for his name, age, place of origin, occupation, address, etc., which Cheng answered one by one. The presiding judge asked, "Do you have any background?" Cheng replied, "I am a citizen of the Republic of China, with no party or faction." The judge asked, "Do you know Yang Erqian?" He replied, "Yes, I know him." The judge asked, "Do you know Liang Jiubin?" He replied, "Yes, I know him." The judge asked, "Do you know Gong Bozhou?" He replied, "Yes, I know him." The judge asked, "Do you know Fan Qishu?" He replied, "Yes, I know him." The judge asked, "Are you the captain of the Anti-Treason Special Service Team of the China Youth?" He replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "When did you join the Anti-Treason Special Service Team of the China Youth?" He replied, "Last September." The judge asked, "After you joined the Special Service Team, were you directly commanded by Yang Xiaoming?" He replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "Do you know the Revolutionary Corps of the Chinese Kuomintang?" He replied, "No." The judge asked, "Is your joining the Anti-Treason Special Service Team of the China Youth commanded by the Revolutionary Corps of the Chinese Kuomintang?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "Can someone who is not from the Revolutionary Corps of the Chinese Kuomintang join the Anti-Treason Special Service Team of the China Youth as a member?" He replied, "I'm not clear." At this point, the official said that the above questions were related to the order of the courtroom, and now he would ask about the murder. The judge asked, "Was Yang Yongtai, the former Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, assassinated by you?" He replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "In which year, which month, and when did you assassinate Chairman Yang?" He replied, "Last year, on October 25th, around 3 PM." The judge asked, "Where did you assassinate Chairman Yang?" He replied, "Jianghan Customs, at the pier." The judge asked, "Did you assassinate Chairman Yang alone, or did you go with several people?" He replied, "Gong Bozhou and I went together." The judge asked, "What tool did you use to assassinate Chairman Yang?" He replied, "A gun, a small handgun." The judge asked, "Did you assassinate Chairman Yang because you joined the assassination group, or was there another reason?" He replied, "That's not the case. Joining the assassination group has nothing to do with it. I have my own will. Since the 20th year of the Republic [1931], I have been traveling to Wuhan, and I understand everything about Chairman Yang. I decided to assassinate him." The judge asked, "Did you know Chairman Yang before?" He replied, "I met Chairman Yang in the spring of the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. At that time, I was in the 89th Division, and we were building the ring road around the city in Hongshan, Wuchang. Later, after the road was completed, our troops were about to leave, and Chairman Yang came to inspect the road. That's how I saw him." The judge asked, "Didn't you say before that Chairman Yang was recognized by Fan Qishu showing you a photo?" He replied, "No, it was Yang Erqian who showed me the photo of Yang." The judge asked, "When and where did Yang Erqian show you the photo of Chairman Yang?" He replied, "It was in early September of last year at the Xin Tai An Inn." The judge asked, "Who else was present at the time?" He replied, "Gong Bozhou. This case always only involved Yang Erqian, Gong Bozhou, and me." The judge asked, "After you saw the photo of Chairman Yang in early September, before the assassination on October 25th, did you go anywhere to find out about Chairman Yang's movements?" He replied, "Yes, two or three times." The judge asked, "How did you find out, and how did you prepare for the assassination?" He replied, "The first time was in early September, on Sandao Street in Wuchang. Gong Bozhou and Liang Jiubao went with me. The three of us waited in front of the Provincial Hospital in the morning, because a group of patients went in to change medicine every morning, and we mixed in with them." The judge asked, "Why didn't you assassinate him?" He replied, "Our plan was to wait for Chairman Yang's car to pass by, and Liang Jiubao would find a way to block the traffic, so that Chairman Yang's car would stop, and we would assassinate him. That day, we waited for a long time, but we didn't see Chairman Yang's car come. At that time, several students passed by us, and Gong Bozhou heard the students say, 'Hurry up, something might happen.' He thought our actions had been noticed, so we didn't wait for Chairman Yang's car to come and left." The judge asked, "How did you prepare for the assassination the second time?" He replied, "The second time was still on Sandao Street. Liang Jiubao went first, and Gong Bozhou and I ate lotus seed breakfast at the restaurant, so we were a bit late. Liang Jiubao waited there for a while. Chairman Yang's car came. Liang Jiubao called a chartered rickshaw and sat in it, walking in front of the car. When he got close to the car, Liang Jiubao asked the rickshaw puller to turn back. Just as the rickshaw puller turned the rickshaw sideways, the car was already approaching. Liang Jiubao jumped out of the rickshaw. Chairman Yang's car also stopped. Chairman Yang's attendant got out of the car and hit the rickshaw puller a few times, then drove away. By the time Gong Bozhou and I arrived, the car had already driven away, so we didn't succeed in the assassination again. These few times, I followed Gong Bozhou's actions. I hardly had any opinions of my own." The judge asked, "Why did you wait on Sandao Street? Is Chairman Yang's mansion there?" He replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "Where did you prepare for the assassination the third time?" He replied, "We didn't succeed on Sandao Street twice, so we decided to change the location. That day, we heard that Chairman Yang was going to the Provincial Party Headquarters and the court to work, so we waited near the Provincial Party Headquarters." The judge asked, "It seems like you said before that it was near the Provincial Government. Which is it, the Provincial Government or the Provincial Party Headquarters?" He replied, "It's the Provincial Government. We didn't wait this time. From then on, we decided to go to Jianghan Customs in Hankou to wait for an opportunity." The judge asked, "How did you find out that Chairman Yang had crossed the river to Hankou on October 25th?" He replied, "One day in early October, Yang Erqian found out that Chairman Yang had crossed the river, and I was staying at the Xin Tai An Inn. Yang Erqian came to call me to wait at Jianghan Customs. I waited there for a long time. Chairman Yang's car came, but there were several cars coming with him. I was afraid of alarming the officials in those cars, so I didn't do it. On October 25th, because I was having financial difficulties, I felt bored sitting in the inn, so I went out for a walk. Later, Yang Erqian found out that Chairman Yang had crossed the river to have drinks, so I took my gun to the Jianghan Customs pier to wait. Gong Bozhou also came. Gong Bozhou and I were chatting idly by the iron railing on the right side of the Jianghan Customs pier when Chairman Yang came. I pulled out my gun and fired two shots from behind Chairman Yang." The judge asked, "On October 25th, was Yang Erqian alone in investigating Chairman Yang's crossing the river, or was someone with him?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "What about Cao Bingrong?" He replied, "I'm not clear." The judge asked, "How did Yang Erqian find you after finding out that Chairman Yang had crossed the river?" He replied, "He came to the Xin Tai An Inn to find me. Because I had gone out for a walk, Gong Bozhou went to the street to find me." The judge asked, "Who decided to assassinate Chairman Yang at Jianghan Customs?" He replied, "Yang Erqian, Gong Bozhou, and I decided." The judge asked, "Was Cao Bingrong present?" He replied, "No." The judge asked, "When you assassinated Chairman Yang on October 25th, you and Gong Bozhou were together. Who fired the first shot?" He replied, "I fired two shots, and then Gong Bozhou and I ran away." The judge asked, "Did you fire the shots from behind or in front of Chairman Yang?" He replied, "From behind." The judge asked, "After you fired the shots, did Chairman Yang fall to the ground?" He replied, "Chairman Yang shouted after the first shot hit his head. He only bent his waist after the second shot." The judge asked, "When you fired the shots, was Yang Erqian present?" He replied, "I don't know. I guess he was watching from the side." The judge asked, "Did Gong Bozhou fire any shots?" He replied, "Gong Bozhou also fired a shot when I fired the second shot." The judge asked, "According to the hospital's examination report, Chairman Yang had two gunshot wounds. You said you fired two shots, and Gong Bozhou also fired a shot. Then, did Gong Bozhou hit Chairman Yang or not?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "Where was Cao Bingrong when you assassinated Chairman Yang?" He replied, "I ran into him at the People's Affairs Office. We nodded at each other." The judge asked, "Was Cao Bingrong responsible for any work there?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "It seems that you said before that Cao Bingrong was standing somewhere as a marker, is that right?" He replied, "I didn't say that. I don't tell lies, and I don't care about anyone, nor do I implicate anyone." The judge asked, "Didn't Gong Bozhou fire first?" He replied, "No." The judge asked, "Where did your gun come from?" He replied, "Yang Erqian gave it to me. One gun for Gong Bozhou, and I got it at the hotel. But at first, when I brought it with me to Sandao Street to wait, when we came back, I wrapped it in a towel on the way and gave it to Gong Bozhou, because I had just joined their group, and they didn't quite believe me yet. Later, at the Xin Tai An Inn, they gave it to me for my own safekeeping." The judge asked, "How many bullets were in your gun?" He replied, "Nine. I fired two, and seven were left." The judge asked, "How many were in Gong Bozhou's gun?" He replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "The gun used to assassinate Chairman Yang is now in the warehouse of this court as stolen goods. According to the rules, I should show it to you to see if it's your gun. Do you want to see it in person?" He replied, "No need, it's probably mine." The judge asked, "Where did you put the gun after you assassinated Chairman Yang?" He replied, "After I assassinated him, I held the gun in my hand and saw that the bullet was stuck in the chamber and couldn't be ejected. I ran with it. Before I ran far, a policeman told me to stop. I pointed the gun at him to escape. Later, I ran to an alley in front of the Flower Building, and I put the gun in my pocket. Unexpectedly, there was a policeman nearby who ran over and knocked me down. I was arrested, and the gun was also confiscated." At this point, the presiding judge ordered Cheng to sign the confession and return to custody.</p>
<p>The next to be interrogated was Gong Bozhou, 37 years old, from Xingren, Guizhou, residing at 39 Xinjiekou, Nanjing. He had previously worked in the military. According to his confession, he had gone to Xingzi County, Jiangxi, and Wutaishan Village Park, Nanjing, with Yang Qixin, but his testimony regarding investigating the whereabouts of Chairman Jiang in Lushan and the former Minister of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing was cunning and evasive. He also claimed that Yang Xiaoming was his maternal uncle in name only. He came to Hankou on September 15th of last year to collect debts from Yang Xiaoming. Regarding the purchase of the gun, his words were also hesitant and did not match his previous confession. However, he admitted to going to Shanghai twice and receiving seventy yuan from Yang Xiaoming. The presiding judge did not announce the adjournment of the court until 4:10 PM. The other defendants, Yang Xiaoming, Yang Qixin, Cao Bingrong, Li Qunjian, etc., were scheduled to be interrogated in a continued investigation court on the 17th at 9:00 AM. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Starting Land Value Tax in Urban Areas</p>
<p>The Wu County Land Administration Bureau is preparing to start collecting land value tax in this county and has decided to start with the urban areas first. On the 18th, it issued a public notice stating that the land value tax in the urban areas will be implemented starting from the 16th year of the Republic [1927]. All land sales contracts that have not yet been taxed must be taxed and exchanged for land ownership certificates within this year to avoid fines. Those who fail to pay taxes after the deadline will be punished according to the regulations. As for the land registration in the urban areas, the bureau has already completed it and is preparing to issue land ownership certificates. The land value tax collection standard will be 10 per mille or 15 per mille of the land value. The approximate budget is that it can collect 200,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Water Police Ordered to Protect Cocoon Markets</p>
<p>The silkworm season in Su Township is now in full swing. Silkworms are opening and developing well. It is a pity that the high price of leaves is causing losses for silkworm farmers. Various cocoon merchants are already preparing to set up shops to collect cocoons. The 2nd District of the Jiangsu Water Police stationed in Suzhou has been ordered to protect the cocoon markets in Wu County, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Guanxing, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other eight counties. After receiving the order, District Chief Ke decided to set up an office in Wuxi starting from the 20th of this month to plan and protect the cocoon shops in various counties in the vicinity.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Universally Establishing Substitute Cocoon Drying Shops</p>
<p>Because the spring cocoons are about to enter the market, the County Farmers' Association of this county is sincerely afraid that a small number of cocoon merchants will monopolize the cocoon price and oppress silkworm farmers. It has specially sent a letter to the Silkworm Model Area, requesting that, according to the precedent of last year, substitute cocoon drying shops be universally designated. After the area approved the letter, it stated that the rise and fall of the cocoon price are stipulated by the Silk Improvement Association of the National Economic Council, and the opening of cocoon drying stoves must be approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Association. Moreover, cocoon shops that dry fresh cocoons on behalf are subject to the Silkworm Industry Control Measures. In order to benefit the farmers, other methods should be planned. However, it is necessary to ask the province for instructions on this matter. On the morning of the 18th, the technical director Zhou Dao took a car to the province to ask the Improvement Association about the number of substitute dry cocoon stoves and various methods.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Investigating the Purchase of Copper and Lead Wire</p>
<p>Sun Huashan, the fourth squad leader of the 11th Security Team of Wu County, together with Inspector Wang Taopeng of the urban police station, went to the home of Gao Shunxing, a tailor in Shuangguifang, and found two baskets of thick and thin purple copper wire and lead wire, weighing a total of 163 and a half catties. Gao Shunxing and his wife, Ms. Fang, were immediately taken into custody, and it was determined that in December of last year, he had purchased 6,992 pounds of old copper wire from the Wujin Electric Factory, valued at 2,990 yuan. Since it is necessary to thoroughly investigate where he transferred it, he was taken to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Conducting Land Statistics</p>
<p>Of the counties in Jiangsu Province, ten have completed all the land registrations, and thirteen are about to complete them. The Provincial Land Administration Bureau plans to use the existing registration materials of various counties to organize and conduct land statistics. Previously, the bureau's technician, Zhang Yanzhe, was designated to plan all the methods and application forms. Now, preparations have been made, and a private house at No. 7 Wujiamen has been rented as an office. At the same time, 45 former Nanjing population statisticians and calculators from the former Central Land Commission have been hired to come to Zhenjiang to perform calculation and statistical work. These employees gathered in Zhenjiang the day before yesterday and began work immediately. It is heard that this statistical work is based solely on the land registration application form, entirely from what was obtained after the land survey. The boundaries are clear, the area is accurate, and the land type and distribution are very clear. Therefore, it must be detailed and accurate, and it is much better than the past, which was based on sampling methods for statistics.</p>

<p>Mulberry Prices Soar During Silkworm Season</p>
<p>The improvement of the silkworm industry in Jiangdu has achieved considerable results, especially in the third district, which has more silkworm farmers, followed by the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. Now, during the busy silkworm season, mulberry prices in the third district have soared, and those who absorb mulberry leaves and sell them to other places are still flocking in an endless stream. On the 17th, Zhoumin Fang Yaoxi and others presented the matter to the county magistrate district office, requesting strict prohibition to avoid affecting silkworm feeding. It is reported that Inspector Qian, sent by the Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Association, went to the third district on the 17th to inspect the silkworm breeding situation together with Yang Rengnong, the chief instructor of this county, and then transferred to the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts to inspect in order to seek considerable improvement.</p>
<h3>Jiande</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Occurs in the West Countryside</p>
<p>Since last winter, bandit cases have occurred frequently in the west countryside of Jiande County, Zhejiang. Because the area is connected to Chun'an and Sui'an, the people often hide and dare not report to the government. On the evening of the 15th of this month, bandits abducted Shao Yu, Wang Yi's nephew (both eleven years old), at the same time near Yangxiyuan and Hexi Village in the west countryside. After being kidnapped, they handed over a letter, claiming to be sent by Commander Ke from Simalu, Shanghai, extorting 8,400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japan Feared Steel Shortage, Plans to Exploit Shandong Jinling Iron Mine</h3>
<p>Testing and assessment underway for large-scale mining. Estimated reserves of 100 million tons, sufficient for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Amidst the shipbuilding race between Japan and other major powers, the demand for steel has surged. Given Japan's small island nation status and its lack of iron ore resources, it relies heavily on foreign supplies. Consequently, iron prices have skyrocketed, doubling from previous levels. Despite restrictions on industrial iron usage, supply still falls short of demand. The Jinlingzhen iron mine in Zichuan County, Shandong Province, has therefore become a significant focus for Japan. This mine was initially exploited by Germans. After Japan occupied Qingdao, it came under Japanese control. Following World War I, iron prices plummeted, and Japan ceased mining operations. With the resolution of the Shandong Question, mines along the Jiaoji Railway were transferred to the Sino-Japanese joint venture, Luda Company. Thus, the Japanese considered it an easily accessible asset. Recently, Japanese mining experts visited Shandong for several days of surveys. The Japanese Xingzhong Company also collected ore samples and sent them to Tianjin for testing and assessment to determine their value, with plans for large-scale exploitation.</p>
<p>The Jinlingzhen iron mine is located between Jinlingzhen Station and Zhangdian Station. The mining area covers approximately 283 square kilometers (equivalent to slightly less than 852 Chinese li). During the second year of the Xuantong reign in the late Qing Dynasty, a Sino-German agreement granted the Germans mining rights to this mine and the Zichuan Fangzi coal mine simultaneously. The Shandong Mining Company was specifically established to manage these operations, later merging with the Railway Company, with a capital of 70 million marks. Subsequently, the Germans planned to establish an ironworks in Cangkuo, with the site already selected and the construction of the smelting furnaces and factories underway. However, with the outbreak of World War I and Japan's capture of Qingdao, the German plan was halted. After acquiring the mine, the Japanese postponed development until 1921, commencing operations in April 1919. However, due to the lack of smelting furnaces, all extracted iron was shipped back to Japan for use in the Yawata Iron and Steel Works. It was projected that 200,000 tons could be extracted annually. The ore veins are located in the Tieshan, Tuanshan, Yuhuangshan, Huangshan, Sibao Mountain, and Qinglong Mountain areas. Estimated reserves are approximately 100 million tons, with a minimum of approximately 80 million tons. Approximately 40 million tons are exposed on the surface, making extraction easy. The ore quality is excellent, with a high iron content of approximately 55% to 70%, surpassing even the Anshan Iron Mine in Manchuria. Mining ceased after World War I. The Japanese now plan to resume operations, intending to establish smelting furnaces on-site, utilizing local coal for iron production, sufficient for 300 years. The Japanese believe this will greatly benefit Japan's military needs in the future.</p>

<p>The Sino-American Trade Association and the American Chamber of Commerce are holding a Sino-American Trade Week from May 16th to May 21st to commemorate Sino-American trade. At noon yesterday, members of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Sino-American Trade Association, and the American Chamber of Commerce gathered for a luncheon at the Water Margin Hotel on the Bund of Beijing Road. Those present included Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Arnold, US Commercial Counselor, Pollen Pettit, President of the American Chamber of Commerce, Miao Zhongxiu of the Sino-American Trade Association, as well as Zou Bingwen, Lin Kanghou, and over one hundred others.

<h3>New Long-Distance Telephone Regulations are Equivalent to Increased Fees</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, requesting that the old regulations be maintained.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, stating that long-distance telephone calls have traditionally been charged in five-minute units. The new regulations now change this to three-minute units, shortening the billing unit, which is equivalent to increasing rates. In recent years, the Ministry has been promoting the use of transportation tools by businessmen and the public and has made great efforts in this regard. It does not seem appropriate to change course for long-distance telephone calls. It is requested that the old regulations be maintained. Furthermore, for expedited calls with extended time, it is proposed that the extended time be charged at the regular rate to facilitate commerce. We request your consideration and instructions. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Issues a Notice to Relevant Industries to Prevent the Purchase and Smuggling of Iron Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to relevant trade associations such as the iron industry, steel bar and scrap iron industry, copper and iron machinery industry, copper and tin industry, hardware industry, and oil and hemp industry. The notice stated that iron goods are of great importance to national defense. Recently, some merchants in the city, only knowing how to seek profit, have been purchasing scrap pig iron everywhere and smuggling it out of the country. If this continues, the remaining scrap pig iron in our country will likely be exhausted. This will not only hinder national defense tools but also cause concerns for industries that genuinely need iron goods, as there may be no goods to purchase. The notice was issued in response to previous knowledge and instructions. The notice asked how to mutually prevent the purchase and smuggling of iron goods. It is hoped that everyone will act in good conscience, prevent such activities at any time, and inform the chamber of any effective prevention measures for verification and handling. This is of utmost importance and is greatly hoped for.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Machine Weaving Federation Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resolved to form a petition delegation to go to Beijing on the 27th to request that import duties on rayon be changed to ad valorem.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Machine Weaving Federation, concerned that the import tax difference between rayon and woven goods is more than double, resulting in a large influx of foreign rayon woven goods and a severe blow to the sales of domestic silk, and having heard that the Japanese Cabinet meeting has decided to request that our country reduce import duties on Japanese goods, which would further hinder the sales of our goods, convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in Shanghai, gathering industry representatives from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to discuss relief measures. Representatives from the Shanghai, Wuxian, Danyang, Hangzhou, and other silk and satin industry guilds, silk merchant guilds, iron machine silk weaving industry guilds, machine silk industry guilds, and silk industry guilds, including Wang Jie'an, Wang Yangzhen, Wang Shaochun, Tang Zhipeng, Cheng Yin Zhi, Jiang Jingtao, Chen Ruoren, Shi Yiren, Deng Gengxin, Han Meiqin, Cao Zhengbing, Wang Yinglin, Yang Junnan, Wang ShouLian, Hu Zongpei, Shen Bowu, Shi Chunshan, and over twenty others, attended. Chairman Wang Jie'an reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by each representative expressing their opinions. Subsequently, the following proposals were discussed: (1) The import tax difference between rayon and woven goods is double, making it difficult to sell domestic silk. It should be requested that the government change the import tax on rayon to ad valorem to provide relief to domestic silk. It was resolved that each group would nominate two representatives to form a petition delegation to go to Beijing to petition the central authorities and request implementation. (2) Regarding the departure date of the petition delegation, it was resolved that the delegation would depart from Shanghai on the evening of the 27th of this month and gather at the Central Hotel in Nanjing. (3) It was heard that Japan plans to request our country to reduce import duties on Japanese goods, which will make it more difficult to sell domestic silk. How should this be dealt with?

<p>Yesterday (18th) marked the 21st anniversary of the martyrdom of the late Chen Qimei. The City Party Headquarters convened representatives from all circles at Lake Society at 10:00 AM yesterday for a memorial service, attended by over 500 people. Chairman Pan Gongzhan gave a report, followed by a public memorial service by Lake Society members, presided over by Shen Tianxin. At the same time, the martyr's relics were exhibited, and flags were flown at half-mast in mourning. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>Yesterday's memorial service was held in the Chen Qimei Memorial Hall at Lake Society on Guizhou Road. The Party and National flags and a white cloth banner were hung in front of the gate, inscribed with the words "Memorial Service for Martyr Chen Qimei Held by Representatives from All Circles in Shanghai." In the center of the memorial hall was the Party and National flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, with Chen Qimei's portrait in the center. Electric torches were installed around the hall, making it dazzling. Fresh flowers, dried fruits, seafood, wreaths, and other items were placed on the table. Slogans were pasted on both sides in order. The four walls were covered with slogans, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan from the City Party Headquarters, Chen Kecheng from the City Government, Jiang Huaixu from the Defense Committee, Wang Xiaolai from the City Chamber of Commerce, Shen Jiesheng from the City Social Affairs Bureau, Qiu Hongzao from the Shanghai Local Court, Gu Ruofeng from the New Life Movement, Ma Hanfeng from the Labor Education Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Professional Promotion Association, Xu Genghua from the China National Products Maintenance Association, Zhang Yichen from the First Special District Citizens' Association, Huang Xianggu from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Hu Shouqi from the Southern District Citizens' Association, Zhu Yaokui from the Bar Association, Huang Kegui from the City Education Association, Qiu Yuji from the Shipping Administration Bureau, and representatives from over 500 people from trade associations such as the Qian Industry and Antique Industry, labor unions such as the Postal Service, Cigarette, and Wharf Unions, law and politics schools such as Jinnan, Jingye, New Asia, and Huzhou, Jingxiong, Shangren, Dezhi, Qimei, and other schools, and various organs and organizations at all levels of the Party. Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Recorder Du Mengsen, Driver Zhang Hanyun. After the rituals were performed as usual,</p>
<p>Pan's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan first gave a report, stating in brief, "Today is the 21st anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Chen Qimei. Mr. Chen's life and deeds are known throughout the world and do not require a report from me. However, there are two things about Mr. Chen that are worthy of our commemoration. I will discuss them separately. First, the spirit of the martyr's support for the leader and belief in the leader is worthy of emulation by future generations. Since joining the revolutionary party, Mr. Chen has never shied away from any difficulties or feared any dangers. He has always obeyed Sun Yat-sen and fought for the revolution. When the first revolution was frustrated, Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and party members were re-registered. Even though some people held dissenting opinions, Mr. Chen remained as he had always been, without any doubt. At this time, Mr. Chen wrote a letter to Mr. Huang Xing, explaining his private thoughts, stating that he would always support the leader and firmly believe in the leader, and the revolutionary party could succeed. Sun Yat-sen greatly approved of his views. This letter is compiled in the complete works of Sun Yat-sen, which shows its importance. Second, Mr. Chen was able to care for and identify talented comrades for the party, which is also a rare quality. Throughout his life, Mr. Chen sought to find useful talents for the party. It can be said that he had reached the realm of knowing people and being good at using them. When General Chiang Kai-shek was studying in Japan, Mr. Chen recognized his ability and introduced him to Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen was also able to recognize Chiang Kai-shek's talent and entrusted him with the important task of training the party army. The revolutionary cause was thus advanced to the realm of success. Today, General Chiang Kai-shek, following Sun Yat-sen's will, is striving to unify the country and working hard on reconstruction to achieve the revival of the nation. Mr. Chen's insight is truly worthy of our infinite admiration," and so on. Finally, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, encouraging the people of the country to sacrifice and struggle for the revolution. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Slogans</p>
<p>(1) Chen Qimei's spirit is immortal! (2) Emulate Chen's revolutionary spirit! (3) Rely on our own efforts to suppress bandits and resist foreign aggression! (4) Support the leader and believe in the government! (5) Chen was Sun Yat-sen's loyal follower! (6) Chen was a revolutionary hero who assisted Sun Yat-sen in founding the Republic of China! (7) Long live the Three Principles of the People! (8) Long live the Kuomintang! (9) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Lake Society Public Memorial Service</p>
<p>Lake Society members also held a public memorial service at the Lake Society Huaxing yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, presided over by Shen Tianxin, with Yan Xuan and Yao Yinfo assisting. The rituals were as follows: (1) Chairman takes his place. (2) All stand at attention. (3) Sing the Party song. (4) Bow to the Party and National flags and Sun Yat-sen's portrait. (5) Chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's will. (6) Silence. (7) Public memorial service is held. The chief mourner takes his place and music is played. (A) Offer flowers. (B) Read the memorial text. (C) Bow three times to the portrait of the late Chen Qimei. (8) Sing the memorial song: a Huzhou Shanghai Primary and Secondary School, Jingxiong Primary School. (9) The ceremony concludes, and music is played.</p>
<p>Reading the Memorial Text</p>
<p>The memorial text was read by Yao Yinfo, the assisting mourner, saying, "On this 18th day of the 9th month of the 26th year of the Republic of China, all members of the Lake Society, publicly commemorate the spirit of our martyr Chen. Alas, Chen's nature was comparable to Zhu and Guo, and Chen's valor shone like the sun and moon. But heaven is unkind, and treacherous bandits paid to assassinate Chen, causing the nation to collapse and the republic to falter. How can our people not feel the pain of a deep-seated illness? Does Chen know this? Chen's righteous banner pointed the way, and all voices echoed with anger against the enemy. Chen's open-mindedness allowed him to borrow wisdom from others, and the members of the association, whether comrades or fellow villagers, followed Chen day and night, and felt honored to do so. Old affections are relived, and tears cannot be stopped. Today, the party and the nation are unified and have a solid foundation. We dare to make this announcement and repeat our words: Alas, since Chen's departure, the clouds and wind have been disturbed, and changes have followed one after another for twenty-one years. The restoration of Hongxian and the recurrence of disasters, the imperialist invasion, and the rampant warlords extended to Sun Yat-sen, who suffered hardships and remained steadfast. Sun Yat-sen’s will was earnest, and the Three Principles of the People were protected with a loud voice. Those who came before and those who followed had successors. In the end, evil forces were eradicated, the people's lives were saved, and the party's righteousness established the nation, laying a foundation for success. To comfort the announcement, we pour wine and offer our sincerity, and present incense in tribute. May you come and receive our offerings. May you enjoy this sacrifice!"</p>
<p>Exhibition of Relics</p>
<p>Lake Society also opened the Chen Qimei Memorial Room to the public all day yesterday. The exhibits included the clothes worn by the martyr when he was assassinated: a black satin mandarin jacket, an ochre cotton robe, and a gray, cooked silk cotton coat and trousers stained with blood. In addition, there were portraits of the martyr from various periods, as well as his calligraphy (such as couplets and letters to his brother Qi Cai and nephew Guofu). There were also commemorative gifts sent by various circles, among which the lamp made from the shell from the Zhaohe Uprising presented by Yang Hu was the most meaningful, with inscriptions on it. The shell was made of Mingjiao.</p>
<p>Flags Flown at Half-Mast in Mourning</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the late Chen Qimei. In addition to complying with the City Party Headquarters' notice to send representatives to the memorial service, all organs, groups, schools, party departments at all levels, and households in the city flew flags at half-mast for one day to express their condolences.</p>

<h3>German Company Recruits Chinese Laborers as Stewards; Unemployed Chinese Workers Demand Employment</h3>
<p>Stating that the termination three years ago was temporary; Party and government organs promise to negotiate with the Jebsen &amp; Jessen Company.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that a German company in Shanghai is recruiting a large number of Chinese workers as stewards on various ships. Wang Chunlin and other previously unemployed German-Chinese workers petitioned the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting employment. The text of their petition is recorded below: Petition for an Order to Employ: We, the petitioners Wang Chunlin, Shen Donglai, and over 300 others, have been working as stewards on ships of the German Jebsen &amp; Jessen Shipping Company at No. 2 Guangdong Road, Shanghai, for more than ten years. Three years ago, the company stated that due to internal political affairs in Germany, they had to employ Germans, and ordered the petitioners to temporarily leave their positions. They promised that if Chinese workers were to be rehired in the future, the old workers would be given priority. Unexpectedly, a third party suddenly entered into a contract in Germany, ignoring the old workers. As a result, the petitioners are all unemployed, displaced, starving, freezing, and living in dire straits. Therefore, we humbly request that your honorable organization order the General Manager of the Shanghai branch of the German Jebsen &amp; Jessen Shipping Company to quickly telegraph the company to terminate the contract with the third party and rehire the petitioners, thereby maintaining our livelihoods. We also rely on your fair assistance to help us succeed. We would be extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association Appeals for Exemption from Increased Salt Tax</h3>
<p>Maintain Existing Tax Rate</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai yesterday sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Military Council in Nanjing, Acting President of the Executive Yuan Yu, and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "According to a letter from Jin Chuxiang, a member of this association, recently reading the newspaper, the new salt law tax rate is about to be revised, and the original tax rate will be increased. The kilogram will be changed to the market catty, and the salt tax will be levied at five yuan per hundred market catties, and the fishing salt tax will be levied at two dimes per hundred market catties. Reading this is extremely alarming. Salt is related to the livelihood of the entire nation, and fishing salt is related to the livelihood of millions of fishermen. At a time when the national rural areas are bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, and the economy is declining, there is no time to reduce it, how can we plan to increase it again? We especially request that it be forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and various ministries and commissions to maintain the tax rate announced on May 30 of the tenth year, in order to alleviate the difficulties of the people of the whole country." It is believed that salt is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. At a time when the people's difficulties have not been alleviated, it seems that it should be handled with caution, so as not to cause harm. For this reason, we telegraphed for your review and approval, and your support is deeply appreciated. Yu Hede, Chairman of the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai, respectfully greets you.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Import of Fish Cargo Increased Greatly</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Guidance Office of the Municipal Social Bureau has been compiling fish cargo reports and statistics for four years. Previously, the situation of domestic fish cargo was investigated from the fish firms in the Sixteenth Bund. Since the opening of the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry, fish cargo transactions have been concentrated. In addition, the Fish Market reported fish cargo transactions daily, so the collection of materials was particularly accurate. As for imported aquatic products, they are based on the figures reported by the customs, so they are also very detailed. At the same time, assistance is also provided by the International Trade Bureau. The quantity and value of imported fish cargo in this city last year are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Fish Cargo Imports Increased Annually</p>
<p>The fish cargo imports in this city, including fresh and salted domestic aquatic products, are transported from Ningbo, Shengsi Islands, and Qingdao, Yantai, and Weihaiwei. Imported aquatic products have increased year by year. Last year's total import was 2,060,751.45 dan, totaling 20,630,023.14 yuan, an increase of about one time compared with the total of 1,408,149.78 dan totaling 15,491,360.64 yuan in the twenty-fourth year. Among them, imports totaled 735,004.00 dan, totaling 7,045,367.00 yuan, an increase of about two times compared with the total of 180,346.240 dan totaling 3,583,012.89 yuan in the twenty-fourth year. If imported goods are counted by exporting countries, Japan is the largest, totaling 541,307 dan, totaling 4,748,325 yuan. The next largest are the United States and Canada, each about 40,000 dan, and the next largest is Singapore, about 30,000 dan.</p>
<p>Quantity of Imported Fish Cargo</p>
<p>The domestic salted fish transported from Nanyang (Ningbo Shengsi Islands) totaled 92,694.80 dan, totaling 967,892.77 yuan. The salted fish transported from Beiyang (Qingdao Yantai Weihaiwei) totaled 55,943.67 dan, totaling 712,531.59 yuan. Fresh chilled fish cargo from Nanyang totaled 86,595 dan, totaling 1,087,1849.6 yuan, and that from Beiyang totaled 19,922 dan, totaling 455,781.24 yuan. Separately statistics by various types of fish, there are 22 types of fresh chilled fish, and the quantity of the main types of fish is as follows: ㊀ Yellow croaker 323,426 dan, totaling 1,643,972.76 yuan, large yellow croaker 222,645 dan, totaling 11,57.535.87 yuan, swimming crab totaled 73,452 dan, totaling 113,888.27 yuan, hairtail totaled 2,065 dan, totaling 873,045.08 yuan, salted fish totaled 24 types, the main ones are as follows: ㊀ Yellow sole totaled 4,340 dan, totaling 69,874.15 yuan, reeves shad totaled 30,471.28 dan, totaling 216,968.20 yuan, jellyfish totaled 25,546.20 dan, totaling 208,295.80 yuan.</p>
<p>Price Fluctuations in the Fish Cargo Market</p>
<p>The price of fish cargo in the market fluctuates according to the amount of imports. Therefore, the market price falls when the goods are crowded during the production season, and the price rises when the goods gradually decrease after the production season has passed. Last year, the prices of the five main types of fish were as follows: ㊀ The production season of gizzard shad is from May to July. During these three months, the average price was slightly less than ten yuan (per dan, the same below). The highest for the whole year was in January, with an average price of 24.5 yuan. ㊁ The production season of yellow croaker is from April to July. During this period, the average price was 6.3 yuan. The highest for the whole year was in March, with an average of 18 yuan. ㊂ The production season of hairtail is from August to October, so the average price was 8.79 yuan. The highest for the whole year was in September, with an average price of about 11.5 yuan. ㊃ The production season of cuttlefish is from May to July. During this period, the average price was 7.8 yuan. The highest for the whole year was in December, with an average price of 15.5 yuan. ㊄ The production season of horse mackerel is from May to June. During this period, the average price was 11.75 yuan. The highest for the whole year was in April, with an average price of 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Half of Industrial and Commercial Credit Loans Recovered</h3>
<p>A total of more than 800,000 yuan can be fully recovered in September.</p>
<p>In the spring of last year, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the repeated financial turmoil and the decline of industrial and commercial professions, raised 1.5 million yuan from the banking industry in this city to set up the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee to handle small-amount credit loans. As of October last year, more than 2,000 loans totaling more than 800,000 yuan had been granted. General small industrial and commercial businesses have benefited greatly. Later, the Ministry of Finance stopped lending because the financial situation was straightened out and industry and commerce were active. All loans are for a period of one year, and half of them have now expired and been recovered. It is said that all of them will expire and be recovered in September of this year.</p>
<h3>Germany Did Not Recruit Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Shanghai, 18th - Yesterday, various newspapers in this city published a news item stating that Germany was recruiting Chinese laborers in Shanghai to engage in active war preparations. According to the German Consulate General in Shanghai and various German shipping companies in this city, this news is purely unfounded rumors. German shipping companies have, for many years, been like shipping companies of all countries in their region, employing laundry workers and cooks to serve on their ships in Shanghai. All crew members employed hold official passports issued by the Chinese governing authorities. As for the statement that they have to wait until they arrive in Germany before being assigned work, it is even more groundless.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Leather Factory Strike Case Social Bureau Order</h3>
<p>Increase wages by five cents, workers resume work</p>
<p>After the workers of the Shanghai Leather Factory on Bailinan Road in West Shanghai went on strike due to the failure to improve treatment conditions, the party and government organs mediated twice. However, due to the increase in wages, the two sides insisted, resulting in no results. The Social Bureau has approved the method and ordered both labor and management to comply with it. At the same time, the workers were ordered to resume work on a specified date. It is heard that the method is to increase wages by five cents, ㊁ allow the dismissal of one male worker, and pay severance pay for one month's wages, ㊂ other conditions will be handled as usual in the factory.</p>
<h3>Two Dyeing Factories Resumed Work Together Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Gongmao and Hengye mercerized dyeing factories on Xie Xu Road and Wei Ning Road in South Shanghai, respectively, previously experienced labor unrest due to workers' demands for improved treatment. Subsequently, the Dyeing Industry Union legally requested the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau to mediate and resolve the issue. It was originally scheduled that Gongmao would start work on the 20th and Hengye would start work on the 18th. Now the procedures for sorting out and stocking up in the two factories have been prepared, so all the workers started working as usual at 7:00 am yesterday morning with good order.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Soliciting Opinions on Estate Tax</h3>
<p>If you have any opinions, please indicate them within a week, so that the case can be sorted out and replied.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association sent a circular to its member banks to solicit opinions on the estate tax regulations. The original letter said: "Dear Sirs, the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan is drafting estate tax regulations. As this is a pioneering undertaking, we are specially soliciting opinions from various public groups in order to be thorough. After receiving the order, this association immediately formed a sub-committee to conduct research. After the committee drafted an opinion report, it submitted it to the 23rd Executive Committee meeting for discussion. It was decided that, for the sake of prudence, we would separately consult with the banks in the association to see if there are any additions or modifications. We hope to gather everyone's ideas and benefit from your expertise in consultation. Therefore, we are specially sending a consolidated copy of the estate tax principles and draft regulations, as well as a copy of the proposed amendments by this association. Please check and receive them, and if you have any comments, please sign and indicate them. Please show them to us within a week so that the case can be sorted out and replied as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>The China Foreign Relief Society Receives Reports of the Tragic Disaster Situation in Gansu</h3>
<p>Urgently awaits assistance from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Foreign Relief Society at 57 Renji Road yesterday received a statement from the Lanzhou Catholic Church Bishop who recently came to Shanghai from Gansu, stating that the disaster situation in Gansu was extremely serious. According to him, the reasons for the disaster were based on natural disasters and man-made disasters. ㊀ There was a severe drought without rain for six months, and there were only two light rains. ㊁ Repeatedly suffered bandit disasters. Now the victims, due to hunger and lack of food, are dying on the road. Those who survive are using tree bark, weeds, and stone powder to fill their hunger, and selling sons and selling daughters is common, especially girls. The rural houses have been destroyed and filled in completely. What is urgently needed is seeds, plows, cattle, food, clothing, and medicine. After the local looting, there is nowhere to buy even with money, because ten houses have been empty for a long time. It takes more than three months from sowing to harvesting in Gansu. Now there is an urgent need for seeds, and the most difficult thing is the lack of strong men. All young people have either been captured, killed, or fled to other places. It is expected that the situation in winter this year will be even worse, and it is necessary to plan ahead. Ploughing cattle can still be obtained from non-disaster areas in this province. If production plans cannot be set up as soon as possible, the local situation will become more unimaginable. The number of disaster victims is estimated to be 20,000 to 30,000 in Lanzhou, 20,000 to 30,000 in Min County, 10,000 in Daozhou, 20,000 in Zhang County, 10,000 to 40,000 in Longxi, at least 100,000 in Jingzhou Pingliang, 10,000 in Ganliang, 20,000 to 30,000 in Wuwei, 10,000 to 20,000 in Zhangye, and 10,000 in Gaotai. According to a letter from the appeal group in the disaster-stricken counties of Hexi, Gansu, Gansu is located in a remote border area in the west, where the land is barren and the people are poor, and it has suffered repeated disasters, greatly damaging its vitality. The wild is full of mournful cries, and it has long been crying for food. Unfortunately, on October 25 of last year, 40,000 to 50,000 communist bandits fled to the west and captured various counties, such as Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, Linze, Gaotai, and other counties, occupying them for dozens of days. The property and savings of merchants and counties, and the food, livestock, clothing, and property of rural areas were looted, not to mention. Therefore, families with a little wealth were immediately bankrupted, and households in poverty immediately ran out of food. In particular, officials, gentry, and people with slightly better livelihoods were often pulled in for votes and interrogated in every possible way. If there was a slight mistake, they would be killed immediately. Those who saw it were horrified, and those who heard it were heartbroken. It is estimated that the people's losses were no less than 30 million yuan, and the number of disaster-stricken people reached more than 170,000. The severity of the disaster is no less than that of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Henan provinces. Now that spring plowing has passed and seeds are lacking, there is no hope for the autumn harvest in the future. If we do not seek relief, the old and weak will fill the gullies, and the young and strong will be displaced. It is inevitable, etc. The association has already allocated 61,500 yuan to the China Jisheng Association to jointly handle Henan relief, and has set up shelters in Luoyang and Zhengzhou. It has now passed Gansu, 10,000 yuan, and allocated it to the branch to handle relief for Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces. It is actively trying to raise funds. It is heard that although the association has allocated funds since its establishment, it is worried that the disaster is widespread and the funds are small, and urgently hopes that all walks of life will give more assistance.</p>
<h3>Guizhou Disaster Relief Association Sends Letters to All Sectors Soliciting Donations</h3>
<p>The Guizhou Disaster Relief Association in this city sent a letter to all sectors yesterday soliciting donations, saying, "Dear Sirs, this year, Guizhou has suffered from prolonged drought and failed to plant spring crops, and the disaster-stricken area has reached more than 60 counties. Two hundred and seventy million people have been affected, and the streets are full of refugees. The tragic situation is unparalleled. Guizhou is originally a poor area, and after two bandit disasters, its vitality has not recovered. It has suffered another great disaster, and the remaining people will not have any descendants. Therefore, the military, political, commercial, academic circles in Shanghai, and fellow villagers from Guizhou Province traveling to Beijing and Shanghai have jointly organized the Guizhou Disaster Relief Association to raise donations for relief. However, the disaster area is vast and a lot of funds are needed. To seek thorough relief depends on everyone's money. I have always been familiar with charity, compassion, and concern for hunger and drowning. For these dying victims, I will surely sympathize and empathize. I hope you will generously donate on my behalf and give me your early kind assistance. I cannot help but look up to you."</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Trials Weaver Loans in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Total amount of 500,000, term of one year, monthly interest of 7 cents for production and sales</p>
<p>Tang Xunmin, general manager of the Bank of Communications, once sent Lu Guojing to Guangdong to investigate the situation of weavers in Lun Jiao, so as to provide loans for relief. Now, with regard to weaver loans, a cooperation contract has been signed with Gu Ligao, president of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, and a trial run will be conducted in Lun Jiao first, because the silk is concentrated in the weaver area of Guangdong Province. The two banks have signed a loan contract with the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Bureau, which will guide weavers to organize cooperatives. The method is that the bank will provide loans to various weaver cooperatives, and the Sericulture Improvement Bureau will guarantee them. The total loan amount is 500,000 yuan in national currency, the term is one year, and the monthly interest is 7 cents. Loans are divided into two types: production and sales. After the results are achieved, it will be gradually extended to the whole province. The above loans have already started.</p>
<h3>Railway Unions in Two Routes Telegraph to Negotiate with Foreigners who Beat Railway Workers</h3>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Unions telegraphed that at 9:00 pm on the 15th, foreigners riding horses destroyed the gate of Zhongshanmen on the Huhang Railway and kicked the gatekeeper Zhao Dengbang. The union believed that the reckless actions of these people were not only insulting to the railway workers, but also insulting to the country. It immediately demanded that the murderers be punished, an apology be made, and compensation be paid for the losses, etc., and telegraphed the railway bureau for serious negotiations. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administration Junjian: According to reports, at 5:00 pm on the 15th of this month, Zhao Dengbang, a member of the union's engineering department and gatekeeper, was working at the gate between Zhongshan Road on the Huhang Railway. Just as the 81st train was about to pass, the member closed the gate as usual. Unexpectedly, two foreigners came galloping on horseback. Because they could not stop in time, they crashed into the gate, and the people fell off their horses, their faces scratched by lead wires. They were temporarily angered and blamed the gatekeeper without asking the reason. They punched and kicked him, causing Zhao Dengbang to be kicked in the lower abdomen and injured. Later, the local military police and road police sent Zhao Dengbang to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment and twisted the two foreigners to the municipal police station for handling. It has been investigated and confirmed by the union that the two foreigners are employees of the American Chinese Business Company, one named Pei and the other named Marks. The police station has now temporarily bailed out the foreigners through the Chinese Business Company. Zhao Dengbang's reason for closing the gate while performing his duties is justified. However, the two foreigners disobeyed the road regulations, galloped on horseback, crashed into the gate, and kicked the gatekeeper. This reckless act should not have been done by people from civilized countries and is insulting to our country. We especially telegraphed the directorate to quickly return to the foreign agency, the American Business Company, for serious negotiations, so as to achieve the punishment of the murderers, an apology, compensation for losses and medical expenses, and a guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future, so as to respect the country. Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Union Council Keqiao."</p>
<h3>China-Japan Trade Association Establishes Investigation Department</h3>
<p>The China-Japan Trade Association passed a resolution at its first member meeting held in Shanghai to establish a complete investigation department to conduct investigations of both countries and prepare for the development of trade. This matter has been negotiated by Zhou Zuomin, chairman of the China-Japan Association, and Kenji Kodama, and a general decision has been made. It is heard that the association's office on the fourth floor of Jin City Bank on Jiangxi Road is now small and not enough for use, and it is currently looking for a suitable building.</p>
<h3>Workers of Gongmao Xing Mercerized Factory Repeatedly Accused</h3>
<p>Lu Bingsheng sued twice, defendants found not guilty</p>
<p>Lu Bingsheng, manager of Gongmao Xing Mercerized Factory, 644 Xie Xu Road, South City (43 years old, from Nantong), commissioned lawyer Di Huyuanjun, sued workers Gu Lingnan, Chen Guoliang, Lu Rongsheng, Zhu Afu, Sun Quanshan, etc. in the local court for intimidating the public and continuously interfering with freedom, saying that on April 17, the defendants joined the union, locked the workplace, and planned to strike, interfering with freedom. A private prosecution has been filed by the people, requesting that the court summon the case for trial. Interrogation was conducted on April 20. However, the plaintiff was unable to present his case because he was delayed in reporting to the shareholders. A request for postponement was filed, but the defendant was declared not guilty in court, and the defendant was instructed not to cause further disturbances. Unexpectedly, the defendants were bold and reckless, ignoring the law. Suddenly, at about 8 pm on the 20th, they gathered many people and did not allow the people to work in the factory. They rushed forward with seven punches and eight kicks. He hurriedly reported to the police for help and had been slapped and covered in mud. The defendants threatened that if the people did not leave the factory voluntarily, their lives would be in danger in the future. They claimed that the court summoned us, and there was nothing we could do. He believed that they were extremely unreasonable, so he was brought to the West Gate Branch, ordered to post bail, and filed a private prosecution in accordance with Articles 304 and 305 of the Criminal Law. He was summoned by Wu Xiangzu to testify, and the defendants were ordered to post bail again. The trial continued the next day, and the reconciliation mechanism reconciled the matter, so the plaintiff returned to the court to request withdrawal of the lawsuit. The court ruled that the lawsuit could not be withdrawn according to law, but since the plaintiff did not want punishment, the defendant was granted, and the defendants were acquitted in court.</p>
<h3>Three Criminals who Plotted to Rob the Water and Electricity Company's Appeal Dismissed</h3>
<p>In the morning of January 9 of this year, they hired a southern car to rob the French Water and Electricity Company of a large sum of money. The robbers, Jiangbei people Shen Chaoyu, Liang Hongzhang, Wang Changxing, Wang Shaoting, Sun Youfa, Xue Shiqing, Qiu Rufu, Liang Tongfang, and eight others, were arrested by the French police, and two pistols, one box cannon, and twenty-six bullets were seized. It was found that they had committed three other robbery cases, all of which hired cars to rob the escorted goods. They were sued in the Special Second Court and sentenced to imprisonment for seven years, five years, to six months, etc. Because the three criminals Liang Honggen, Tu Shaoting, and Xue Shiqing refused to accept the original judgment (the original judgment sentenced Liang to seven years and two months of imprisonment, Wang to seven years, and Xue to five years and one month), they appealed to the High Third Branch for trial. The date for sentencing was set, and the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for sentencing. Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, together with Associate Judges Chen and Wang, ordered the appellants to be brought to the Criminal Division II, announced the judgment, and dismissed the appeal. After the judgment, they were still returned to the detention center.</p>

<h3>Gansu Disaster Area Appeal Group Comes to Shanghai to Appeal for Relief</h3>
<p>Disaster victims not only have no food but also no clothes. Scheduled to invite all sectors to plead for benevolence.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in the counties of Hexi, Gansu is extremely severe. The victims not only have no food but also no clothes, and are dying on the road, experiencing the most tragic events in the world. Since the province is located in a remote area in the west, with blocked transportation and slow news, people in the southeastern provinces are very isolated from it. After receiving the news of the disaster, Zhu Nonglan, chairman of the Relief Committee, transferred from Sichuan to Gansu to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. The central government has made an overall plan to allocate funds for relief. However, in order to make all sectors truly understand the disaster situation, people from the disaster areas of Liang Le, Jingtai, Yongdeng, Gulang, Wuwei, Yongchang, Shandan, Minle, Linze, Zhangye, and other counties selected representatives to organize the Gansu Appeal Group to go to the southeastern provinces to appeal for relief. It is learned that a group of more than ten people, including Jiu Jianxing, went to Beijing at the beginning of the month and reported the disaster situation to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Relief Committee, and requested rapid remittance for relief. The result was satisfactory. The group then set out for Shanghai the day before yesterday, and will schedule a special invitation to all sectors of the city within a few days, and please generously solve the benevolence, so as to make clear the integration of small contributions into a sac, and to relieve the disaster-stricken Li people who are about to die.</p>

<h3>Zhou Zibin and Son Seduce and Rape the Huang Mother and Daughter</h3>
<p>Father and Son No Longer Visit; Mother and Daughter File Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>Huang Guifang, a woman from Jingjiang, currently residing in a three-story building at No. 74, Duncun, South Chu Family Bridge, Mintini Road, French Concession, is 35 years old. She was formerly married to Zhu Yin'fu, a fellow villager, and had a daughter named A Ying, who is 17 years old. Later, due to disagreements between the couple, they divorced by mutual agreement in 1932. The daughter was raised by Huang Guifang. The mother and daughter made a living in Shanghai by sewing. In June of last year, Huang Guifang was introduced to Zhou Wangbin (53 years old), a native of Lingjiang who owns two medicinal material shops, Guangyisheng at No. 292 Wuzhou Road, Public Concession, and Guangrentang at No. 230 North Henan Road. They became intimate and first had relations in a hotel. Later, Zhou rented No. 1 Xianglin Lane, Qiujiang Road, to live together. The Huang mother and daughter then abandoned their sewing work and relied on Zhou for their livelihood. They subsequently moved to No. 204 Malong Road and No. 6 Changli Lane, Haining Road, and finally to their current residence at No. 74, Mintun. From then on, Zhou's affection for Huang gradually cooled until he stopped visiting altogether. Zhou's son, Zhou Zhenming, also known as Wang Guangde, 23 years old, often visited Huang's place to find his father during the period of intense affection between his father and Huang. Seeing that A Ying was of marriageable age and not unattractive, and that he was not yet married, he seduced her. In December of last year, Zhou's son gave A Ying a blue glass ring, falsely claiming it was a diamond ring, and seduced her into having sexual relations. They made a secret vow of lifelong commitment. From then on, he continued to meet A Ying secretly. The matter was discovered by A Ying's mother, Huang Guifang, who confronted the Zhou father and son. The Zhou father and son agreed to hire a matchmaker, send betrothal gifts, and formally marry A Ying. Unexpectedly, the matter was delayed until today, and Zhou Zibin has not held the marriage for his son, and Zhou Zibin and his son Zhou Zhenming have not visited Huang's place. Furthermore, they have disregarded the daily living expenses of the Huang mother and daughter. After unsuccessful negotiations, Huang Guifang, believing that the Zhou father and son intentionally seduced, raped, and abandoned her, hired lawyer Tang Xingjian to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special First Court, accusing Zhou Zibin of abandonment. At the same time, as A Ying's legal guardian, she hired lawyer Tang to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhou Zhenming, also known as Wang Guangde, of disrupting the family. She requested that they be investigated and punished according to the law. In the Special First Court, Judge Feng Shide held a preliminary hearing and ordered a new hearing to examine evidence. In the Special Second Court, Judge Sun Penghan presided over a hearing in the Second Criminal Division yesterday. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. The court declared the hearing closed to the public due to the case's scandalous nature. It is reported that after the plaintiffs, mother and daughter, stated the facts of the lawsuit, the defendants presented a marriage certificate, claiming that they had divorced Huang A Ying in November of last year. However, the facts presented by the two sides were inconsistent, and each insisted on their own version. As a result, the court ruled that the case be suspended and instructed the defendant to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division to confirm the marriage. The trial will resume after the judgment is finalized.</p>
<h3>One-Yuan Banknote Can Be Changed into Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Russian and Servant Scam; Apprentice Suspected of Making Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Ying He Da, 39 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 47 Guanyinge Street, Xinkaihe, Chinese Concession, who works as a deliveryman at the Jishi Foreign Firm, met Li Shuchun (20 years old), a Cantonese youth who works as a servant for a Russian named Bo Xin, Xin Yidaenuofu (transliteration), at No. 6 Bushixing Road, Bushi Road, French Concession, a week ago. Li told him that his master had magic and could turn a one-yuan banknote into two yuan, which could be used in the market. Ying, driven by greed, entrusted Li with 530 yuan in cash from the Ji Huatang Pharmacy, where he worked, on the 15th of this month, to be handed over to the Russian, Bo Xin, Xin Yifanuofu, to be transformed into double the amount the next day. When the time came to collect the money from Li, Li claimed that the banknotes handed over the previous day were counterfeit and could not be transformed. At that time, the Russian had avoided meeting him, and the matter was dropped. The day before yesterday, Ying went to demand the return of the original banknotes, which led to a dispute with Li. The two sides were taken to the French Concession Police Station, and the police detained the Russian. Ying was also detained because he was also at fault. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where they were interrogated by Judge Chen Shuoying. The police lawyer, Tiao Zhaodi, stated that the defendant Li Shuchun and the Russian had committed fraud, and that Ying A Da was suspected of counterfeiting banknotes. He requested an extension for investigation and then a formal trial. The court verified the statements, briefly questioned the defendants, and ordered a new hearing on the 21st. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Old Woman Injured in Accident Turns Out to Be Xiang Sheng Car</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from the Registry Office of the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, stating: "We were surprised to see a news item in your newspaper on the 18th of this month about a car from our court's prosecutor's office injuring an elderly woman in her sixties. The description of the incident is not only inconsistent with the facts, but completely contrary to them. It was found that at about 8 a.m. that morning, Prosecutor He of our court, because of a case for inspection, took a bailiff and a legal police officer in a car to Zhenru Road via Heping Road. He saw a Xiang Sheng car coming from the opposite direction. An elderly woman on the road was unable to avoid it and was hit by the car. Prosecutor He, fulfilling his prosecutorial duty, immediately ordered the car to stop and instructed the legal police officer to get out of the car and detain the offending car. At this time, a nearby traffic police officer arrived after hearing the sound. Prosecutor He, believing that there was someone responsible, was about to direct the police to detain the perpetrator when two people in gray uniforms, similar to car drivers, stopped our court's car, claiming that the old woman was injured by our court's car. They were aggressive and unreasonable. Prosecutor He believed that it was important to rescue the victim. He ordered the Xiang Sheng car to take the old woman to the hospital and drove to the Ximen Police Station to report the incident to the patrol officer of the station, ordering him to send the offending car for investigation. The situation at the time was witnessed by many. Your newspaper's reporter did not investigate and reversed the facts. We ask that you make a correction to clarify the truth. We wish you all the best. Sincerely, Registry Office of the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, May 18th."</p>
<h3>Yonggu Paint Factory Invites the Press for a Visit</h3>
<p>Yonggu Paint Factory was founded in 1926 and was the first to manufacture domestic paint. In recent years, the factory's products have been in high demand, recovering many rights. The factory is located at No. 900 Jiangwan Road. Due to business development, the old factory's buildings are insufficient, so a second factory has been added at No. 12 Labor Sheng Road. Jiangwan Road is the first factory. The various paints made under the Great Wall and Windmill brands are bright and lustrous, strong and durable. The factory has been established for ten years. In order to expand its business, yesterday afternoon, the factory specially invited the city's press to visit the paint manufacturing process. Many reporters from various newspapers attended. The factory's managers and others warmly welcomed them. After a short rest upon arriving at the factory, they were guided to visit all parts of the factory. The various paint-making machines they saw were the latest models. The internal operations were orderly, and the management system was scientific. The factory also has a chemical laboratory dedicated to engineers to test various new paint inventions in order to continuously improve and strive for progress. In terms of sales, in addition to supplying the needs of major commercial ports throughout the country, the company has international customers, such as the South Seas Islands. The "Great Wall" brand special gray anti-rust paint is particularly unique, as it has never been available in China. It must be used for all national railway bridges, ship hulls, steel materials, and large buildings. It can be permanently used after two coats of paint, and the price is only 40-50% of foreign products. It is truly the best of domestic paint. After the visit, the manager provided refreshments, and the event ended at 5 p.m.</p>

<h3>Xiaoluo Music Society Performs Twice Every Evening</h3>
<p>The renowned Xiaoluo National Music Society held its second concert at the Lyceum Theatre the night before last (the 17th). Around 9 p.m., the road on West Love Road was crowded with traffic and very lively. Many audience members came from faraway places such as Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui. There were also many Western gentlemen and ladies who came for the fame. The depth of its achievements and the distance of its reputation can be imagined. The opening was at 9:15 p.m. The program included Longlongwei, Borderland Song, Brahma Palace, Yulun Robe, Chang'e Flies to the Moon, Autumn Cries of a Dying Orchid, Changmen Lament, Moon High, and so on.

<h3>Bandits Prepare Cars to Rob Rice Sifters and Vegetable Baskets</h3>
<p>Fei Junfu, 54 years old, from Songjiang, recently hired two civilian boats from his hometown of Yiyun to transport more than 3,000 rice sifters and vegetable baskets made of Qing bamboo. At 6 a.m. yesterday, the boats arrived at the Shi Yunhui section of the Pu River in South Shanghai and docked. Fei then shouldered a sample of the goods ashore to peddle. Unexpectedly, seven or eight bandits swarmed onto the boat, forcibly loaded all the rice sifters and vegetable baskets onto a waiting car in a loading area, and sped away. Fei returned at noon and found that he had lost everything. He was extremely frustrated. After receiving the news, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to investigate. They have found leads and expect to solve the case soon.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Two Male and Female Gamblers Escorted to Court for Trial</h3>
<p>At 10:30 p.m. the night before last, the Xinzha Police Station of Zhabei, acting on a tip-off, reported that there was a large gambling den at No. 44 Yiren Lane, Kulun Road, and requested immediate arrest. The station dispatched Inspector Meng, along with police chiefs Chuan Zhonghe and Zhang Shuilai, and police officers Cui Zhengguo, Cui Yu, and Wu Dichen, to the police station at the Zhen Road to investigate. They found a large group of gamblers who were in high spirits. When they saw the police, they fled in all directions. As a result, they arrested a total of thirty-two male and female gamblers, as well as gambling tools, wooden treasure chests, gambling funds of silver dollars, small silver dollars, copper coins, and other items. They were taken to the station, interrogated by the officers, and ordered to be escorted to the Shanghai Local Court yesterday morning at about 10 a.m., along with the gambling tools, gambling funds of six yuan and nine jiao in silver dollars, and an anonymous report letter. The names of the gamblers are as follows: Shen Mingde, Ren Danhua, Xu Asi, Shao Liang, Ding Apin, Gu Awu, Zhou Amao, Li Pinsheng, Zhu Decheng, Wang Desheng, Yu Yuesheng, Bao Wuyou, Tang Yimin, Shu Hesheng, Gu Fuxing, Sun Caixing, Cai Alin, Hu Zhengsheng, Hu Caizhang, He Xiangfa, Wang Along, Li Gaosheng, Li Alai, Zhang Ligui, Chen Shaokang, Li Weisheng, Yan Zhengkang, Li Dingan, Hu Ahua, and the women Li Zhongshi, Huang Zhushi, and Xue Yinshi, totaling thirty-two people.</p>
<h3>Bai Asan Causes Trouble Over Debt, Six Yuan Costs a Life</h3>
<p>Jin Daotian Beaten to Death</p>
<p>Jin Wanjv (60 years old, from Yangzhou), a dock worker, and his son Jin Daotian (35 years old), owed Bai Asan, a crew member on the Xiaofu boat, six yuan. On the 16th of this month, two barges arrived at Bailianjing, Pudong, to unload goods and parked at the pier. Bai Asan immediately asked Jin Daotian for the six yuan. Jin could not pay, and Bai cursed him. Jin retorted, and a fight broke out. Wang Shanliang, a colleague of Bai Asan, was strong and powerful and rushed to help. Bai Asan punched and kicked Jin Daotian, injuring his vital parts. Jin immediately fell to the ground. Jin Wanjv reported to the Water Patrol Team, who arrested Bai Asan and Wang Shanliang. Jin Daotian was sent to the Shanghai Hospital at the Liangshi Santai Pier for treatment, but died at 6:30 p.m. on the 17th. Yesterday, Qin Defang, the head of the 23rd Baojia, reported the case to the local court. Prosecutor Zhong Chao and Inspector Shen and others were appointed to the court to examine the body. They ordered the family to collect the body and await interrogation of the defendants.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Suddenly Robbed</h3>

<p>Shen Tingrong, a 16-year-old apprentice from Shaoxing at Gu Liaohao, residing at No. 6 Baishou Lane, Penglai Road, Fushi, was ordered by his boss, Chen Wu, yesterday morning at 10:30 to withdraw 100 yuan in legal tender from the Bank of China at Xiaodongmen, as well as more than ten yuan in room rent from a certain place. While walking near the Yuxing Bridge on Zhaojiabang Road, Dadongmen Street, three bandits, one long and two short, carrying two pistols, suddenly jumped out from behind and snatched away all the banknotes before fleeing without a trace. The apprentice was startled and stood there like a wooden chicken. Passersby called the police on his behalf to pursue the escaped robbers.</p>
<h3>Joint Conference on Cholera Prevention</h3>
<p>Organization of a Central Epidemic Prevention Communication Agency</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Conference on Cholera Prevention was held at the Municipal Government at 3 p.m. on May 17th.

<h3>Dismembered Corpse of a Young Girl Found in Two Locations</h3>
<p>Examination of the Lower Body Suggests She Was a Virgin; The Court is Requested to Investigate and Arrest the Murderer</p>
<p>At about 1 p.m. on the 14th of this month, the head of a young girl wrapped in an old blue cloth shirt, about 15 or 16 years old, with short hair and pierced earlobes, was found in a small stream behind the headquarters of the Fifth Team of the Pengpu District Security Corps, Jiangmiao Road, Gonghe New Road, Zhabei. The cloth was stained with blood. The Tanjiaqiao Police Station of the Xinzha Sub-Bureau sent police officers to retrieve it. Since the case was a brutal murder, they continued to dredge the bottom of the stream. Unexpectedly, at about 3 p.m., they found two arms, clearly dismembered by a murderer's deadly hand and thrown away separately to destroy the evidence. They immediately notified the local Baojia to petition the local court for an examination. After the body was collected, the sub-bureau immediately ordered the detectives under its jurisdiction to strictly investigate the murderer for prosecution. Several days have passed, but no clues have been obtained. Unexpectedly, at about 7 a.m. yesterday, a blue-black cloth package floated down the Suzhou River near the Fujian Road Bridge with the receding tide. It was spotted by a Western patrolman from the Customs Water Patrol Department. He retrieved it and found that the package was tied with hemp thread. Unwrapping the cloth revealed the lower half of a young girl's body. The upper part of the body above the waist and the legs below the knees had been cut off. The murder weapon appeared to be a sharp, broad knife used by butchers. The wound was smooth, and the skin was pale due to being submerged in water for several days, but it was not swollen. The lower body appeared to be that of a virgin. The station took it back to the police station. After the head of the station examined it, he speculated that the cause of death might have been due to a failed rape attempt, which led to this brutal act. The truth is still difficult to ascertain. However, there is no doubt that the torso belongs to the same body as the head and arms found in Zhabei. It is believed that the murderer used six cuts: the first to cut off the head, two to cut off the arms, one to cut off the torso, and two to cut off the legs. The full body is still missing the chest and feet. It is feared that more parts will be discovered soon. The head of the station immediately ordered the detectives to take half of the body to the Rescue Bureau in the afternoon and report it to the local court for examination. Due to the lack of time, officials will be dispatched to the bureau this morning to examine the body and collect it.</p>
<h3>Cao Qiming Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping, Followed by a Series of Threatening Letters from Bandits</h3>
<p>Authorities are Cooperating to Rigorously Investigate; Cao is Mentally Disturbed and Has Gone to Be Treated in Beiping</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: Cao Qiming, a local resident and former manager of the Baofeng Cotton Firm on Jiangxi Road in this city, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits on the 6th of this month in front of his residence on Laoshifu Road. Fortunately, passersby shouted for help, and Officer Han Jiao Cai of that precinct arrived. The bandits immediately opened fire to resist arrest, resulting in Han being shot and killed. Cao was able to take the opportunity to escape unharmed. These details were previously reported. It is now learned that Cao Qiming was so deeply traumatized at the time that he became mentally disturbed and has been accompanied by his family to Shanghai in recent days to seek treatment in Beiping. The affairs of the cotton firm are also being finalized. However, the bandits have not given up and continue to send threatening letters daily, as many as four or five a day. His family has reported this to the French Concession police, requesting a thorough investigation. The police are currently cooperating with the Chinese and British Concession police authorities to rigorously investigate and resolve the case as soon as possible. According to reporters' investigations, Cao Qiming has been in the yarn and cotton business for many years and has accumulated considerable savings. However, nearing sixty years of age and without a son, he felt particularly lonely in his twilight years. He used his private savings to oversee the construction of a cemetery on Junjing Road, both to beautify the local landscape and to pass the time in his later years, spending over ten thousand yuan in total. He had exhausted his life's energy on this. Last year, he also suffered significant losses due to speculative failures. It is also said that Cao is known for his philanthropy, donating generously to local public welfare causes. Therefore, he has been outwardly strong but inwardly weak for years and burdened with debts, making him a target for bandits, which can be considered unjust.</p>

<h3>Yanshou Temple Renovated and New, Hoodlums Demand Protection Money</h3>
<p>Extortion Attempt Fails, Resulting in Extensive Vandalism; One Suspect Arrested and Prosecuted</p>
<p>Venerable Miaoshan, the abbot of Wannian Temple at 225 North Xizang Road, recently took another position and transferred the temple to the management of Monk Yushan. Yushan then changed the temple's name to Yanshou Temple and carried out extensive renovations, preparing to hold an opening ceremony soon. Unexpectedly, this came to the attention of local hoodlums. On the 19th of last month, at around 9 PM, they gathered a gang of accomplices and went to the temple, intending to extort sixty yuan in protection money from Monk Yushan under false pretenses. When they were refused, they immediately started a fight, destroying all the items in the room before scattering in all directions. Afterward, Monk Yushan reported the incident to the French Concession police, who ordered a thorough investigation. It was not until the day before yesterday that Detective No. 2 Zizai arrested a suspect in the case, Yan Fukang, at the 260 North Shanxi Road teahouse, and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him for attempted extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, and stated the details of the case, noting that accomplices such as Ma Pi A Chun were still at large and requesting an adjournment. According to Monk Yushan's testimony, the circumstances of the extortion and vandalism by the group were described. The defendant, Yan Fukang, claimed, "That evening, I asked my friend Wang Aqing for five yuan he owed me. Later, I learned that Wang was at Yanshou Temple, so I went there. Unexpectedly, a fight was taking place in the temple, so I tried to mediate and did not attempt to extort anyone." Judge Huang reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending a further hearing.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Drug Offenders Arrested in the Hongkou and Zhabei Areas</h3>
<p>Twenty Drug Offenders Arrested, One Hundred and Twenty-Eight Packets of Heroin Seized</p>
<p>Recently, drugs have been spreading rampantly in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas of this city. According to a reporter's investigation, the Yongxing Road Police Station alone arrested more than fifty drug offenders last month. On the 17th of this month, officers Zhao Zhenfang and Yao Chengbin of the Changjing Police Station arrested a total of twenty-one drug offenders and seized one hundred and twenty-eight packets of heroin in areas such as Qiujiang Road. They were sent to the bureau for strict handling. It is reported that most of these drugs are purchased from Korean residents and Japanese ruffians. The police station chief is still actively investigating and confiscating drugs.</p>
<h3>Allegations of Torture by Caojiadu Police Station are Untrue</h3>
<p>Reports in recent days have stated that the Caojiadu Police Station in this city tortured Zhou Apin, a worker at the Dahua Leather Factory, to death, which has drawn considerable public attention. The reporter, finding the reports bizarre, wanted to investigate the truth and conducted investigations with relevant parties yesterday. The facts did not match the reports. Zhou Apin was a worker at the Dahua Leather Factory who stole a motor from the factory. When he tried to sell it in the concession, he was first arrested by the Hongkou Concession police. After learning that the crime had taken place in the Chinese area, they notified the Detective Team of the city police bureau by telephone and sent officers to transfer Zhou Apin to the local court for trial. Zhou Apin was later released on bail by the court and died at home. Therefore, the case was never handled by the Caojiadu Police Station or the detective team stationed at that branch. The report that the Caojiadu branch handled the case is clearly inconsistent with the facts. As for the report yesterday that the local court held a hearing and that a public official had been detained, the person in charge of the city police bureau stated that no public officials of this bureau had been detained.</p>
<h3>Famous Cantonese Opera Martial Artist Liang Rong to Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Liang Rong, a famous Cantonese opera martial artist, is as famous as Bai Ju, a young male lead, and Qian Li Ju, a female lead. Bai Ju and Qian Li Ju have both been to Shanghai, but Liang Rong has never been. According to reliable news from Guangzhou, Rong is planning a tour of Pingjin and will soon depart from Guangdong. The owner of the Guangdong Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road, upon hearing the news, immediately asked Rong's friends to persuade him to perform at the theater for a few days when passing through Shanghai. It is reported that Rong has agreed. Rong has served as the lead martial artist in famous Cantonese opera troupes in Hong Kong and Guangdong, such as "Renshou Nian," "Daluo Da," and "Gaosheng Le." His outstanding performances, such as "Farewell My Concubine," "Acheng Sells Vegetables," "Night in Caofu," and "Guan Zhang Fight in the Ancient City," have long been household names. His records are also popular at home and abroad. This time, he will perform at the Guangdong Theater in Shanghai. Those who wish to witness Rong's demeanor and artistry should pay attention to the date of his performance.</p>
<h3>Cui Shisheng Sentenced to Thirteen Years for Drug Trafficking</h3>
<p>Cui Baosheng from Tianjin recently secretly sold red pills in Lane 143, Taopeng Road, for profit. Wang Rulin, a detective from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Inspection Office, learned of this and sent an informant to purchase the pills. At 10 AM the day before yesterday, the informant purchased a packet of fourteen pills with a secret code using two jiao in subsidiary coins. Detective Wang then rushed forward to arrest him and confiscated a large bag of seventy packets, totaling more than seven hundred pills, from a house at No. 66 in the same lane. They were taken to the Yulin Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant claimed at the police station that the pills belonged to Zhou Kui, who lived in a flat on Longjiang Road, and that he was selling them on his behalf. Zhou has fled and is being pursued. The red pills were presented for inspection. Judge Zhong Qing questioned Cui Baosheng and sentenced him to thirteen years of imprisonment, and the red pills were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Issuing Bad Checks Results in Fine</h3>
<p>Zhang Feiran, a 36-year-old resident of Qipu from No. 6, Jide Village, Gaojia Lane, West Gate in the Chinese area, hired lawyer Pan Renxi to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court against Xu Yinghai, a resident of No. 26, Heng'an Lane, Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, for issuing bad checks, requesting an investigation and demanding the recovery of the 900 yuan debt attached to the civil suit. According to the lawsuit, in early February of this year, the plaintiff's friend, Pan Yihua, manager of the Congming Advertising Company, needed funds and exchanged two Central Bank checks signed by the defendant, one for 500 yuan and one for 400 yuan, both dated August 9, for 900 yuan in cash from the plaintiff. When the checks were presented to the Central Bank for payment, they were dishonored due to insufficient funds. Pan Yihua was entrusted to pursue the matter with the defendant, but after two months, the matter remained unresolved. The plaintiff requested an investigation. The court, after receiving the complaint, held a hearing yesterday morning presided over by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. Both parties and their lawyers appeared in court. After questioning by the court, the case was deemed simple and clear, and the proceedings were concluded after arguments. The court ruled that Xu Yinghai was fined 500 yuan for issuing bad checks and ordered to repay the plaintiff the 900 yuan debt.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Dies from Electric Shock</h3>

<h3>Lianqing Society's Charitable Donations</h3>
<p>Excellent Results, Reaching 7,000 Yuan; Charity Ball at the Paramount Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lianqing Society, for its Lianqing Children's Clinic, the Children's Playground in the People's Village, and the planned vocational education projects, began raising funds and scheduled a charitable ball at the Paramount Grand Ballroom on the afternoon of the 19th at 8 PM. According to Ma Bole, the chairman of the Society's Fundraising Committee, this effort has received considerable sympathy from all walks of life, with donations of cash, advertisements in the program, and prizes to add to the festivities, for which they are sincerely grateful. The total amount raised has exceeded 7,000 yuan in national currency. There will also be a lottery at the ball tomorrow night, which has been carefully planned and is expected to be very successful. There will be over 900 prizes, with a total of 3,000 tickets, so three out of every ten numbers will win a prize. There are fifteen major prizes, including a 1937-style Arctic electric refrigerator worth 800 yuan in national currency. Even the smallest prize is worth about three yuan. Tickets that do not win a prize can be redeemed for two linen handkerchiefs or a silk flower from Beiping, so every ticket has a reward.

<h3>Gong Guobao Accused of Seizing Land Certificates</h3>
<p>Entrusted to Exchange Certificates, but Instead Pledged for Loans; Wu Dingde and Others Discover and Sue</p>
<p>Wu Qiutang, also known as Maosheng, a native of this county, owned a considerable amount of real estate in Shanghai. He had one son and five daughters. The son's name is Pengchen, and he is not yet an adult. The eldest daughter, Fengquan, the second daughter, Dingde, the third daughter, Lindi, the fourth daughter, Gendi, and the fifth daughter, Fudi. The eldest daughter married Wu Jin, and the second daughter married Lin Baochen. The fifth daughter married Gong Guobao, who works for the Shanghai Finance Bureau. Qiutang passed away many years ago. In addition to the sons-in-law, the other daughters were given considerable dowries when they married, so all the estate was divided and managed by the eldest and second daughters and the son, Pengchen. In August 1934, Fengquan, Dingde, and others entrusted their brother-in-law Gong Guobao to exchange the three land deeds of the ① Two mu and eight fen of farmland in Tuze, Dongshang, Nianba Bao, Huafa District, ② Eight fen of farmland in Tuze, Wuliu Bao, Huafa District, ③ Three fen and one li of farmland in Tuze, Shiwu Tu, Nianba Bao, Pusong District, along with three years of grain receipts, at the Land Bureau for land ownership certificates. Unexpectedly, Gong pledged the land under the names of Wu Qiutang and Wu Zhenzhi to the Quangong Bank and Ma Xiangsheng for huge sums of money. Wu Dingde and others were unaware of this at the time. Later, the Quangong Bank filed a lawsuit with the local court requesting a provisional seizure of the pledged land, and the matter was discovered. Wu Dingbao and others filed a lawsuit with the local court contesting the enforcement of the seizure and hired lawyers Xu Shihao, Zuo Daotao, and Rong Zhenglong to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Gong Guobao for the crimes of forging documents, breach of trust, and embezzlement, requesting that he be punished in accordance with Articles 210, 341, and 355 of the Criminal Code. Judge Shi Lin held a hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division yesterday. The defendant, Gong Guobao, was not summoned. After the plaintiff submitted a written statement of the case, the court ordered an adjournment for further hearing.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Disputes on Buddha's Birthday</h3>
<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>Although I have no personal understanding of Buddhism, I am fortunate enough to read in the newspapers about property disputes involving abbots, hidden romantic affairs, and various national protection, disaster relief, and peace conferences. (With the serious famines raging in the eight major provinces, I wonder if these conferences are to be credited?) Such "Buddhist teachings" are varied and truly fascinating to behold!</p>
<p>Amitabha, now I have the fortune to read a piece of news stating, "The dates of the Buddha's enlightenment and birth are disputed, and the calendars of various ethnic groups also differ. After consulting the customs of Tibet, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, and other countries, it is proposed that the full moon day in May of the Gregorian calendar (corresponding to the fifteenth day of the fourth lunar month) be designated as World Buddhist Memorial Day. However, our country has traditionally observed the eighth day of the fourth lunar month as the Buddha's birthday for two thousand years, which is respected by the entire nation. This association does not dare to make a decision based on the opinions of a few people. Therefore, we intend to write to various prominent figures for their consent and then telegraph the Panchen Lama to forward the proposal to the National Government for promulgation as a memorial day. We hereby send this special letter to seek your detailed review and earnestly request a reply."</p>
<p>Naturally, this news item is not as sensational or lively as disputes over property leading to bloodshed or the discovery of aphrodisiacs in meditation rooms. Moreover, I have no affinity with Buddhism and cannot provide an answer (what I cannot understand is how Buddhist believers can be so confused about the Buddha's birthday, leading to "various conflicting opinions"). According to the proposals of various monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists, the opinions are also quite "conflicting": "① We should uphold our existing customs and not blindly follow the proposals of others; ② We should follow the intention of the Panchen Lama and handle the matter as he proposes; ③ The existing memorial day should be maintained, and the Panchen Lama's proposal should also be supported. We might as well establish a new memorial day in addition to the existing one."</p>
<p>These proposals all seem to have their own reasons and are truly interesting and delightful. I am neither a monk nor a lay Buddhist, and I have never even read a Buddhist scripture, so I naturally have nothing to say. However, from these three proposals, one can discern the Chinese philosophy of life, which I would like to discuss. Naturally, this is unrelated to Buddhism.</p>
<p>The first group of people says that all "existing customs" are correct, so "we should not blindly follow the proposals of others." This, combined with the saying "it has existed since ancient times," means that the older it is, the better. Moreover, this "ancient" must conform to oneself. The second group of people, on the other hand, believes that power is strength, so "we should handle the matter as [the Panchen Lama] proposes," which means "Can you ever be wrong, haha?" The third group of people is even more shrewd: "What you say is correct, but we must also take care of our 'existing customs'," so "we might as well establish a new memorial day in addition to the existing one." In this way, both sides can get by.</p>
<p>These three ways of dealing with the world can all easily gain a foothold in this world. The first one is relatively dangerous, but it has "existing customs" to rely on. Since "customs" have become "existing," it is known that they do not hinder the world; otherwise, to put it nicely, wouldn't they have been "eliminated" long ago? So it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Among the ways of dealing with the world, only being earnest is the most dangerous, the crime being "innovation." For example, with the Buddha's birthday, I think someone must have thought of investigating the actual date of the Buddha's birth, but because it is too troublesome and might even reveal a third date, it would require starting from scratch. Therefore, those who are well-versed in the ways of the world use "existing customs" or following the superiors to secure their position.</p>
<p>Because of this, there is food to eat, and there is good food to eat.</p>
<h3>Mobile Education Vehicle</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>The mobile education vehicle was created by the Zhenjiang Public Education Museum of Jiangsu Province. It was completed by the China Motor Company in this city the day before yesterday, and a public demonstration was held yesterday at the Confucius Temple Park in the South City. I went to see it at that time.</p>
<p>It is a new tool for popularizing public education in the interior of China using electrical and chemical teaching methods and is still a novel concept in our country. Because it is not only equipped in a novel way, but also very comprehensive.</p>
<p>The body of the vehicle is very high and powered by diesel. On the shiny green color are written many red slogan characters, which seem particularly bright and eye-catching. On the front of the car, beside the sign "Mobile Education Vehicle" is a couplet, "Practice the New Life, Eliminate Old Habits." On the rear of the car shed is "Watchable, Listenable, Learnable, Doable," and on both sides are slogans, "Adopt Film and Radio Broadcasting, Unify National Thought." On the top rail of both sides of the car are inscribed in Imitation Song typeface: "The performer is like a teacher, the audience is like students, the listener is like attending class, and the phantom is equal to the real object," and "The screen replaces the blackboard, the projection book replaces the textbook, the broadcast replaces the oral instruction, and the plaza is like a lecture hall."</p>
<p>It is said that their work is divided into eight points, such as: holding central exhibitions, conducting mobile lectures, introducing standard domestic products, taking photos for the masses, circulating public reading materials, imparting scientific knowledge, broadcasting current affairs news, and showing educational films. The interior of the carriage is also very exquisitely furnished. The sofa seats, cypress tables, and broadcasting machine platform are all very tidy. In the very center are the Party and National flag and the portrait and will of the Premier, with portraits of Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang on the left and right. The walls of the car are hung with images of ancient and modern scientists, educators, ancient sages, and national heroes. In addition, there are scientific, chemical, and medical books and other equipment. The car has a conference room that can accommodate sixteen people, which is prepared for village, township, and baojia chiefs to hold meetings. The books can also be borrowed and circulated, with only the book price charged as a deposit and no handling fee charged. As for taking photos, only the cost of the film is charged. All the clothing, teaching materials, food, and lodging of the staff are completely inside the car. It is almost like a small public education center. Various decorations can also be arranged on the roof of the car, such as long tables, long benches, flagpoles, broadcasting machines, film projectors, etc. Therefore, it can be used as a podium or platform in a large public place and can raise flags. An umbrella can be propped up to protect from rain. An iron rod can be installed in front of the car. When it is necessary to show a movie, it is only necessary to install the iron rod, extend it to a considerable distance, and stretch out a square screen to show the movie. In addition, the periphery of the car is equipped with sound amplifiers, so that the speech, singing, and speaking of people on the stage can be heard very clearly throughout the audience, and four hundred light-emitting diode lights are installed on all sides, so that education can be carried out in the countryside at night.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Liu, who is in charge of the car, their car can not only travel on developed roads, but can also pass smoothly in places where transportation is not very convenient. Because everything on the car can be loaded and unloaded. In rural paths and places where cars cannot travel, it is only necessary to disassemble them piece by piece and have people carry them or transport them by boat, which is also very convenient.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Liu, there are four other service personnel on the car, including staff, doctors, mechanics, and laborers, who sincerely serve the people to the best of their ability. And the car, except for the radio, movie projector, and camera, which China does not yet manufacture, is entirely equipped with domestic products.</p>
<p>At present, the car is the first to appear in China. It is said that in the near future, this electrical education tool for popularizing public education will appear throughout China.</p>

<h3>Working as a Guide for a Day</h3>
<p>— Zhu Liying</p>
<p>I know very clearly what "guide" has become in Shanghai, but many of our companions, for the sake of survival, have willingly fallen into that dark hell, doing what is called a beautiful "guide." I think that among these many pitiful people, some are said to have been abducted, and naturally they no longer have the freedom to control their own bodies. As for others, like myself, at least having studied for a few years and knowing clearly the inhuman life of a "guide," yet still throwing myself into this dark hell, can you say that I willingly fell into degradation? Those who have full bellies will never know the suffering of hunger; for money, humanity is forever separated into two different worlds.</p>
<p>Now I will tell you how I started my life as a guide, although it was only for one day. Speaking of which, perhaps like other unfortunate companions, I grew up in a poor family, but if my father had lived a few more years, the situation would not have been so tragic. He was a small clerk in a public institution, and he desperately saved on food and clothing, not only to support a family of three, but also to support my schooling. For my schooling, my mother argued with him countless times. My mother indeed had her own ideas, thinking that what use was it for a poor family's daughter to study? But my father was determined that his child must study, regardless of whether it was a boy or a girl. Fortunately, I finally finished junior high school, but my father eventually became ill from overwork and parted ways with my mother and me. Afterwards, it was of course impossible to continue studying, and I should immediately bear the family's living expenses. I unexpectedly found a position as a primary school teacher without much effort. With thirty yuan a month, my mother and I could barely make ends meet. But you also know what the situation is like in the alleyway schools of Shanghai. For the first two months, the salary could be paid on a monthly basis, but after that, they became impolite. The principal often avoided meeting us. Even if we met him, no matter how difficult you said it was, he would light a cigarette and always ignore you. To be able to occasionally receive one yuan, or a few cents, from him was something that happened less than once a month.</p>
<p>After working as a teacher for one semester, I received two months' salary and two yuan as a "special reward." My father didn't leave a single penny when he died, so you can imagine how difficult the past six months have been. Naturally, I left that school in the next semester, but finding a job afterwards was not as convenient as you might imagine. In the meantime, I also worked as a nanny in a mansion, but unfortunately the male owner had ulterior motives. Other so-called "women's occupations" that looked very beautiful also frightened me so much that I quit after only a few days... Finally, I was forced to try working as a guide.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I was also deceived by advertisements, which said that a candy company was hiring several female salespersons, but when I went to apply at the address on the advertisement, I knew it was another slippery trick. The candy company was upstairs in a tailor shop. As soon as I entered, I saw a table of women playing mahjong. A young, slippery young man glanced at me and asked if I was there to apply. I nodded, and he immediately honestly told me that this was a guide agency. According to my previous temper, I would have turned around and run away long ago. At that time, on the one hand, I had reached the point of having no way to go, and on the other hand, I also wanted to see the inside story of the guide agency. After he asked for my name, place of origin, etc., I signed the contract he gave me without hesitation. He wanted me to go to the "office" the next day.</p>
<p>Those poor companions were very kind. They told me many "tricks" for dealing with customers. Usually, when I read news in the newspaper about our companions being insulted, I initially thought that both parties should bear some responsibility, but now I feel that those "customers" are really terrible. They completely regard us as another kind of woman.</p>
<p>On that day, one of the companions took leave, and when a customer called to specify her, that slippery young man (who turned out to be the boss) immediately introduced me, using a product promotion speech, telling people on the phone: "There is a newcomer, a high school graduate... Very fresh! I guarantee you'll like her!" Think about it, what kind of talk is this?</p>
<p>That customer was quite honest. He asked me many questions about school, probably trying to test whether I was a high school student. After sitting for more than two hours, he gave me five yuan. Later, I learned that because he was the "old customer" of the companion who took leave, he didn't dare to do anything to me to avoid causing trouble. Only heaven knows!</p>
<p>When I handed in the money, I honestly told them that I had received five yuan. The boss smiled and only asked me to hand in three yuan. The two yuan was my "extra money," and the agency didn't ask about these things. That night, the boss wanted me to go dancing. He said that guides who knew how to dance could take advantage of it, and he was willing to teach me, because having a high school student in a guide agency was very eye-catching. But when we got to the dance hall, he changed his face. He forced me to drink, and when we danced, he deliberately said some lewd things and held me in a very impolite way. Looking at him, I really didn't know what bad intentions he had! When it was twelve o'clock, I insisted on leaving, but he still wouldn't let me go. He said that today's five yuan wasn't he who helped me especially, so I should obey his coercion as a reward.</p>
<p>I finally saw the true face of this dark hell. We not only have to endure the insults of the "customers," but also those demons who suck our blood and sweat are setting up nets everywhere to make us their prisoners!</p>
<p>I didn't dare to go again the next day. I am now wandering at the "crossroads" again. Where should I go?</p>
<h3>Hometown Loquat</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>Spring is fading, and at this time a wisp of leisurely sentiment leads me back to the garden of my hometown, especially the loquat tree that I planted with my own hands.</p>
<p>My hometown is easy to see summer in, and the loquats of my hometown ripen early with the enthusiastic and happy girl that is summer. When spring fades and flowers wither, whether in orchards, in the wilderness, or along the roads, loquats everywhere show their vigorous and heroic posture. The excessively broad, green, and hairy clusters of leaves set off the soft yellow fruit, like stars in the deep blue sky—they directly attract countless admiring moonlight and greedy saliva.</p>
<p>Yes, loquats are lovely. They have a unique personality—they are not sour, nor do they give people excessive sweetness. They are like simple girls in the wilderness, quiet and gentle. The flowers of the loquat have a pure and gentle fragrance, and the juice is refreshingly sweet. In the bleak autumn wind, they bud; fighting against the frost and snow of the harsh winter, they unfold their petals; welcoming the warm wind of early spring, they bear fruit. I love loquats, I have planted them with my own hands; in the front yard of my old home, I entrusted its life.</p>
<p>It was in middle school that the small tree I planted with my own hands tentatively conceived fruit for me. My heart blossomed at the same time as the loquat flowers, and my joy was revealed by every action and every word. However, I worried that such a small body would not be able to bear beautiful fruit, so I more carefully fertilized and irrigated it, helping it absorb nutrients as much as possible. Whether it was morning or dusk, there was never a time when I didn't joyfully part the hairy, broad leaves, and caress each ball of fruit, each grain of fruit. I determined which ball was the most beautiful, and which small fruit was growing the fastest. Looking at the laden new fruit, it was like looking at the dearest person, who was about to give birth for the sake of our love so quickly. The joy in my subconscious was often revealed by the dreams of late spring.</p>
<p>As the seasons changed, the fruit shed its old clothes of emerald-like dark green, revealing new clothes of soft, gentle, goose-yellow color: this was simply like bright roses blooming in my heart. Apart from myself, no one knew how beautiful and happy this heart was.</p>
<p>Because of excessive love, I also imitated the methods of others in managing orchards: wrapping all the fruit with gauze to avoid damage from birds. At this time, I couldn't tell if they were rejoicing in their safety, or if they were annoyed by my selfish act of making them unable to see the light of day? Perhaps they were proud of their master's love; but I myself resented how there could be animals in the world that harm the growth of others, forcibly separating me from them.</p>
<p>Every evening, I carefully unwrapped the gauze, stroked them one by one, examined them one by one, noting their growth status that day, and then carefully wrapped them one by one, as carefully as a loving mother cares for her sleeping baby. Habitually leaning beside it: now I am having melancholic illusions. At the same time, I am also considering who will be the one to enjoy my most fragrant and sweet fruit!</p>
<p>A sudden bandit rebellion tricked us into fleeing to another land. My dear little tree, my soon-to-be-ripe sweet fruit, everything in my hometown, all became the property of others, and my joyful heart couldn't help but darken.</p>
<p>Three years later, I returned to my hometown for the first time, stroking the lovely little tree I had planted with my own hands—no, it already had a rather large and vigorous trunk, proudly protruding from between the fences. But the bullet and knife wounds it bore clearly recorded the traces of the bandit rebellion.</p>
<p>For ten years, I have been floating around, rarely having the opportunity to see my hometown. Even if I do, it is rare to encounter the time when the loquats are ripe. Even its flowering and budding are not allowed for me to see. But I long for the dangerous situation in my hometown from three thousand miles away, and I miss my sweet companion even more—the loquat—when will it call me to taste its sweetness and honey again!</p>
<h3>Deserted Pier</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>The pier is wide open, its mouth pointed at the narrow river.</p>
<p>"The pier is deserted!"</p>
<p>For more than ten years, from a middle-aged woman to the current old beggar, this process is easy to grasp in her memory. There was a period of prosperity, and the old beggar even had some savings.</p>
<p>The decline of reality is astonishing. In the past, the Changxing Rice Shop, which earned high interest, still maintains a cold facade. The shop assistants are idle enough to doze off; the shopkeeper holds a water pipe and stares blankly at the pier in a daze.</p>
<p>"Has the world changed?"</p>
<p>Indeed, rice boats have almost disappeared. If one or two are discovered, the scales on the pier will become active.</p>
<p>The desertion of the pier makes the river water seem to be forever still, without even a ripple.</p>
