<p>時評</p>
<h3>經濟與外交</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在現代的國際關係上。經濟與外交已經形成非常重要的連繋。不但重要而且這種連繋也是非常微妙的國與國間經濟關係的增進。有時是表示眞正友誼的發展。有時却正相反的表示侵略支配的加深。所以在國際關係上我們常常聽到“經濟合作、”這個好詞令。在某種情形下。可以作為誠意的外交態度的表白在另一種情形下也正可以看作侵略的外交活動的掩護。</p>
<p>因為經濟與外交具有這樣密切的關連。所以這次日本經濟考察團來華的。特別引起了各方面的注意。這考察團由日華貿易協會會長兒玉謙次領導。它的代表人員的重要。它在出發前的新聞宣傳。使我們意識到它的使命。决不是僅限於“經濟”的。而據三日中央社東京電。兒玉氏在他對記者的談話中。說到“東亞兩大國。實應從大局上着眼。相互合作。而致力於緩和各種磨擦。儘速掃盡目前之不快狀態。使之明朗化。”又說到“經濟提携一點。”以為現在“一般人均誠摯感覺中日兩國友好關係之改善。及兩國人民之和諧實為先决條件。”這些話和不久以前林首相在施政演說中所表露的正合着節拍。由此我們想到兒玉氏這次經濟考察團的來華。其外交的意義。實在要大過於經濟的意義。</p>
<p>不要多少天這個“經濟使節”的團體就要光臨我們的國土了。說句坦白話。我們一般寬大而且良善的中國人。對於遠道的來賓總是歡迎的。對於兒玉氏所表白的“極無些微惡意”的意思。也竭力希望自己能够加以信託的。不過。說句更坦白的話。這幾年來。我們寬大而且良善的中國人。在世界的廣大變動中。在我們親歷的經騐中。卻已獲得了不少辛辣的教訓。例如。對於經濟與外交的密切關連就是我們所獲得的教訓之一。而在這次佳賓惠臨之前。我們又不得不把這個教訓回味起來。</p>
<p>我們從自己的經騐說起。近幾年來。“經濟提携”這個好詞令。我們是常常聽到的。在華北。似乎比別處更來得流行。但是華北所受到“經濟提携”的實惠是怎樣呢。第一是海關的被刦奪。第二是走私的橫行。第三第四以至一切結果。是我們的經濟資源漸漸成為他人“準戰時經濟體制”的附屬物。我們固然不願懷疑他人的“惡意。”但是我們已在“經濟提携”這個好词令下。感受到超乎“恶意”的残酷教訓了。在世界的廣大方面。我們若要在無數的實例中略舉一二。則美洲的古巴當是一個。美國和古巴的經濟關係最密切。但古巴這個“糖罐子”所有的甜味都是給美國人嚐的。古巴自己所得到的。只是武裝干涉的辛辣苦味而已。</p>
<p>這樣。對於“友邦”佳賓這次所懷抱的熱烈期望。事實上的殘酷教訓。却使我們不敢樂觀了。不過兒玉氏在對記者談話時那句“奮勇”的結論。說到在政治上必要堅决尊重中國的領土主權。這話倒是值得深思的。因為離開了這個根本的政治條件。所謂“經濟提携”者。確實只是達到外交上某種目的的掩護而已。假使兒玉氏對於這句結論確有誠摯的感覺。我們希望他在蒞臨我國之際。或者先取道我們的東北。然後南下。或者在訪問我們南方之後。再到長城外去看一下。因為那裏屬於中國的領土主權。現在却被插上了別國的旗幟。</p>

<h3>英下院三讀通過國防國債案</h3>
<p>邱吉爾亦發言擁護　德有重砲千五百尊</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國國防公債法案已於今日在下院三讀通過、該法案授予政府權利於五年內舉債四萬萬鎊、此議案、提出三讀時、工黨曾動議取銷、但議院終以二四一票對一一七票予以通過、於是該議案卽移交於上院、今日辯論中最可注意之演說、為大政治家邱吉爾對於政府整頓軍備之辦法、表示慶幸、彼稱政府之五年軍備計劃、英國財力之偉大、各黨各派之擁護、以及世界各國、尤其各小國之歡迎、俱足證明各自治領及各外邦與不死顛亦步亦趨、實有利益云、</p>
<p>邱吉爾復謂、英國現根據於國聯盟約、與英法間之特別協定而成立一種外交政策、乃大衆人民所需求者、倘英國今後能繼續施行其國防政策、至四年五年、則英國將臻於自德國重整軍備後更安全更適宜之地位云、</p>
<p>邱吉爾繼稱、現空軍概算、尚未送達議院、彼表示以現狀觀之、空軍概算之須由公債中撥支者、約有六七千萬鎊之間云、</p>
<p>邱吉爾對於政府提案之中未曾加入軍備建築程序中各項軍備可得之數目及其一定日期、表示遺憾、被稱德國除已經裝置之重砲外、尚有重砲一千五百尊、彼詢英國究於何時能有可靠最新式重砲一千五百尊、及受有訓練之士兵及相當之設備、</p>
<p>邱吉爾復宣稱英國之下院已無法繼續漠視國家安全之大問題、尤其在政府已承認其預測錯誤之後、彼詢政府能否担保英國之空軍、在此一年之後其實力能否增强、較之目前與德國之空軍實力、相差不致過遠、或德國之陸軍、不致永久維持其對法之優勢、邱吉爾復稱、今日英法之諒解、實不啻對於不經挑釁而實行侵略者之一種防守同盟、而兩國間之友善卽為和平繼續存在、或相互生存最大之保障云、</p>
<p>財相張伯倫於是繼邱吉爾發言、將辯論作一結束、彼謂議會之討論、已足證下院對於國家重整軍備之需要、已有眞實普遍及根本上之了解、反對黨雖稱英國之軍備、超過事實之需要、並謂英受攻襲時、他國必起而相助云云、但同時他國受襲擊時、英國將起而助彼等、故英國之負担實有增而無减也、</p>
<p>張伯倫復謂、英國在國聯盟約之下、尚無於他國受攻擊時、須以武力相助之義務、</p>
<p>張伯倫未復表示、其深信英政府所循行之軍備政策、實為最後軍縮時期前必需經過之初步云、（中央社四日路透電）</p>

<h3>中學畢業會考問題（二）</h3>
<p>— 應</p>
<p>統觀會考辦法前後變更情形、會考科目迭次减少、今已减為五科、約及昔之半數、會考前學校不復舉行畢業考試、僅舉行學期考試、以纍計學校之畢業成績學期考試之所考者僅最後一學期之科目及其內容範圍、與畢業考試之須考試三學年所習全部科目及其內容者區以別矣、會考各科範圍雖亦為各該科三學年之全部學程、然而會考五科目中僅算學•理化•史地等科為較有實質內容學科、其國文外國語二科係符號學科、以積漸修養為功、無憚精强記之勞、設非會考而舉行學校畢業考試、則在初中須考全部學程者尚有公民•勞作•音樂等科、學程早經結束須重行全部考試者、有生理•衛生•植物•動物等科、在高中須考全部學程者有體育•音樂等科、學程早經結束須重行全部考試者、有公民•論理•生物學等科、又况會考辦法以物理與化學•歷史與地理各併為一科、較之畢業考試各科目為單位者、其輕重難易又顯有不同、是內舉行會考、所有三學年中全部科目及其內容、一部份僅須考試最後一學期之學程、一部份以早經結束免予考試、一部份又合併二科目為一單位、非會考所加於學生之担負遠輕于學校畢業考試乎、至於會考一二科不及格者之先准升學、補考後仍不及格之救濟、畢業成績之計算均經迭加改善、又由會考估計學校成績確有不少流弊、其尤著者為不良學校平日管教廢弛、臨時大量留級、冀减低不及格人數與參加會考人數之比例、貽害青年甚巨、變更辦法已逕予刪除矣、</p>
<p>使會考而僅為無害、則亦無取於多此一舉、然固求其有利也、其利維何、在欲整齊中學學生畢業程度及增加教學效率、中學課程標準雖自十八年後卽已頒行、但各校採用課本仍復參差、自會考施行、命題一依標準範圍、於是各校教學不得不確遵標準、採用審定教本、凌雜情形頓形改變、至於各科教學情形反映於會考結果者、以最優科目言、二十一年度高中為國文黨義、初中為黨義國文地理、二十二年度高中為地理黨義國文、初中為黨義史地、二十三年度高中為黨義國文史地、初中為黨義國文理化史地、以最劣科目言、二十一年度高中為算學外國語、初中為算學自然外國語、二十一年度高中為算學•外國語•物理、初中為外國語•算學•國文、二十三年度高中為算學外國語、初中為外國語•理化•算學是統三年言之、無論高初中、其較優科目均為黨義國文二科、史地次之而最劣科目均為外國語•算學•理化及自然等科、鑒於此種重大之缺陷謀所以補救之者已施行三事、一為修正課程標準、高中算學自第二年起分組教學、甲組時間較前增多、而課程內容照舊不變乙組時間减少、內容程度亦低减、使學生得就個性所近、分別選習、務獲確實熟練、二為厲行教員進修、暑期講習班已續續舉辦三年、算學及理科特加注重、講習及選派辦法亦日趨嚴密、三為科學儀器之製造、自二十四年起教育部聯合管理中英庚欵董事會及中華文化教育基金委員會共撥欵項委託中央研究院物理研究所依據部頒高初中理化設備標準製造國產科學儀器、减價售與全國各中學、本年此計劃更擴大範園繼續舉辦、將來各校務須均具備此項標準設備、以增進科學教學之效率、凡此固改進中學教育所應行舉辦之事、然藉會考結果之參證、則先後緩急益知所抉擇耳、總之、因會考而整齊中學畢業程度與提高教學效率雖不易驟覩其效、然年來各校教者學者對於課業之認眞努力、一掃過去敷衍虛浮之弊、則確為昭著之事實、循是以往中學生知識教育之漸臻確實、一業程度之漸趨整齊、可以斷言、至青年因努力課業而行動趨於常軌、學風日臻嚴肅、實為會考制度之副作用、初非其主要鵠的、說者乃謂“會考制度為鞭策學生用功於書本、增加其工作、移其對國家社會之注意、藉以消弭學潮、”難免有具色鏡觀察、認識不清之嫌、卽就消弭學潮一端言、亦為倒果為因之推證、</p>

<h3>紗花紗花近期較堅</h3>
<p>遠期殆或强弩之末　現交頗有發展氣象</p>
<p>紗市上日大漲後、昨則稍有反動、昨見回挫但趨勢尚參差不定、蓋以美棉一品紗雖俱回落、然跌度甚微、惟一般空方、鑒於目前紗廠錠子開齊、做空心思奇濃、故近期印商派雖把持不放、且較堅昂外、遠期則拋賣甚力、所以多空兩方競爭劇烈、前途若何仍依實需而伸縮也</p>
<p>紗市入後愈不振</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤•本月份因上日漲風太激、微回小七角、又以美棉三品紗漲風稍戢、人氣見鬆、但一盤開拍、多頭在近月仍買進、市况復挺、迨至收盤、聞現紗交易連前成交在一千一百包外、某方面多頭略有出籠　檯面一平、市價回落、四月期猛落一元一角遠月隨之而下　標紗結果、近月比上日收盤價漲二五角、遠跌三•四角午後開盤、本月份多頭稍有了結、市價回跌幾角、遠月愈見怠懈、一盤後仍無上升能力、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌六•八角至一元、查賣出錦昌四千一百包、賡豐二千九百包、望泰興九千五百九十包　頣大一千五百五十包、恒昌一千九百包、生源九百包、仁豐一千零五十包、元一七百包、信誠七百五百包、買進大華九百包、恒益一千三百五十包、興昌一千七百五十包、泰昌一千二百五十包、益昶一千九百包長豐七千九百五十包協成一千九百五十包、合興一千包、茲將一日間行市比較於後、</p>
<p>現紗成交二千包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚稱不頗、查全日各帮買去統計二千一百零四包、售價與上日相仿各地買額如下、　　棉市轉趨平淡、因美棉大漲小回頭、人心軟化、但印棉漲風尤熾、故有一部份頗有多頭觀念、不過紗市回挫、市况稍受影響、但現棉廠方進意漸濃、日廠採辦較旺云、</p>
<p>期花更缺乏精采</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉漲跌互見、印棉仍漲二至四羅比、大阪三品花跌一二角、市況人心平凡、各月漲跌五分、二盤隨紗市上升一二角、迨至收盤復回下、標花結果各月比上日收盤價漲跌五分至一角、午後開盤市况平庸、進出在五分至一角間、結果本月比上午收盤價跌一角外。其餘勿動、查賣出恒德一千九百担、裕大一千二百担、裕康三千五百担、泰興一千九百担、森康二千五百担、義成四千一百担、潤康六千一百担、恒昌一千四百担、生源四千一百担、新昶二千一百担、益康一千七百担、昶記一千一百担、買進同興三千四百担、吉豐一千五百担、恒益五千二百担、泰昌二千二百担、益昶五千六百担、長豐四千二百担、大昶三千九百担、新華二千六百担、新興五千二百担、源興昌二千八百担、明華二千五百担、茲將一日間行市比較於後、</p>
<p>現花廠需漸開展</p>
<p>現棉消費尚堪維持、廠胃漸見開展、來源姚花一千三百包云、</p>
<h3>各紗廠購進原棉較少</h3>
<p>—二月分的統計—</p>
<p>二月份上海中外各廠購進原棉合計七萬一千五百九十八包、較一月份减少七千六百四十二包、其中華廠購進四萬六千二百二十九包、較一月减一千六百八十包、日廠購進一萬五千三百六十九包、較一月减五千九百五十四包、其减少原因、乃以廢曆年關及新春間之休業、一時市况清淡、而紗廠買意隨之消沉、一方面廠家在廢曆年前、頗有相當買進、故近呈觀望形勢矣茲將二月份華日廠之購辦棉量列左、（單位包）</p>
<h3>美棉一日間上落頗大</h3>
<p>昨日美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、利物浦、同業及經濟商活動買進、各月漲五至八磅音、旋以大批多頭了結及套賣之故、反動甚烈、尤以近月為最、其後限價買進復起、經紀商買進新棉、現棉繼續堅昂、布需較活、市價又漲、三月期交割通知單十一紙、立被接受、外商購買、直至收盤、同業似有等候新鮮發展、收盤平穩、計現貨跌三磅音、期貨跌三磅音至漲八磅音、英棉現貨漲十三點、期貨漲三四點、印棉初因美棉消息良好而漲、旋以套賣及多頭獲利了結而回、卒以空戶抵補及期貨商買進再昂、收盤時有多頭了結、計平果商漲二羅比、奧姆辣漲三•七五至四羅比、白羅溪漲三•五至三•七五羅比、原電錄左（四日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、五日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百二十四羅比、奧姆辣為二百十六羅比、平果爾為一百八十五羅比半、均跌一羅比、</p>

<p>其合夥組織所分設之支店，資本自本店劃來者，亦可填入營業資本地位。或本店申報本表時，預備將本支店所得分別申報者，則以股本實額，除去劃與支店後之餘數，填入營業資本地位。支店申報本表時，並無劃分之資本者，可於營業資本地位填明資本在本店字樣，本表所填之營業資本或股本實額，應與謄清簿中所記之資本或股本，及為商號登記時所報之資本或股本相同。合夥之立有議單者，賬簿上關於資本或股本之記載，亦須與議單相符合。公積金及盈餘之未經正式轉作資本或股本者，不可混合計入。如必欲報明其公積金，可於備考地位填入之。其實依照現行關於所得稅之法律，公積金如不轉作資本或股本，尚未能以其三分一，加入資本計算，以為計算所得稅率之基礎。蓋第一類營利事業所得稅徵收須知草案第五條，曾規定公積金之以三分之一加入資本計算者，僅以依法令所規定之公積金為限。而所謂依法令所規定之公積金，實為公司法第一百七十條對於股份有限公司所定之公積金。凡個人經營或合夥組織所提之公積金，尚非依法令所規定之公積金也。各商家對於行號報告表之未盡能如期申報，其主要原因，卽由資本額之未能决定。因按諸現行關於所得稅之法律，營利事業之計算所得稅，係先算出其所得合資本實額百分之若干，然後援用累進之稅率，算出其應繳納之稅額。同一獲有若干之盈餘，其資本愈大者稅率愈小。此種觀念，各商家大部份已經深入。但我國簿記法，大部份未經改良。對於資本實額之計算，因陋就簡，未曾完備。甚有當初投入本金數千元，現其純財產上達數十萬元，而賬上之資本額仍記數千元者。或有營業規模宏大，財產之組織又甚複雜，而賬上竟無資本者。以致整理核計，遷延時日，行號申報，因以遲緩。實則本表所申報之事項，將來可以變更。現在賬簿已有資本之記載者，或資本額之已經一部份之響理掛股啊、無鑰其寫數若干，儘可先行申報。至將來完全核實算出時，再為變更之申報。其所申報之額，若暫與商號登記及合夥議單未符者，亦屬不妨。商號登記，可以變更。合夥議單，可以重訂，或另立升股收條也。（未完）</p>

<h3>婦女們目前的新任務</h3>
<p>— 金聲</p>
<p>“婦女解放”“男女平等”的呼聲，在這個非常時期裏，却是一天增高一天了，表面上當然未始不是一種進步的現象，不過我們如在事實上觀察一下，却又感到大大的失望！因為現在一班的婦女，一方面高呼着“男女平等”，而另一方面又甘心給“男子作玩物”，一方面高呼“婦女解放”，一方面又給自己加了“無限的束縛”，要知婦女求“眞解放”“眞平等”，决計不是靠空話所能收效的，而是要實幹的，至於怎樣可以實幹的要義，分列如下：</p>
<p>一·智識的美　智識是維持生活的基本，如一個人沒有智識，就是無靈魂的軀殼他沒有思想；凡遇事物都存心倚賴，無論何時何地，總難去掉這種惡習，若一旦倚賴的目標，遠離或隔世，到那時恐怕東走西撞，到處都感到苦痛了所以欲求解放，必不能存倚賴心，欲求不倚賴，自己先要有一種獨立的精神，心中要有相當的智能，所以我們要努力我們的學業，充實我們的智識，尤其在這個非常時期，不得不力求日進，美化我們的智識，做一個時代的婦女。</p>
<p>二·健康的美　要有健全的智識，必須先有健全的身體，要身體的健全，必須有適當的運動，有了健康的身體，能耐勞苦，能耐勞苦，然後才有作事的力量，有了作事的力量，就不患“男女不平等”，“婦女不解放”了。</p>
<p>三·德性的美　具有健康的體格，和充分的智識，倘沒有美的德性，則精神智識，反足以助其作惡的思念，如見他人衣飾華麗，生活舒適，如遇一位無德性的婦女，就生羨慕之心，一經誘惑，卽易墮落了，像這種缺乏德性的婦女，如何能談眞平等呢？所以無論那個婦女，要尊重自己的德性，要認清自己的責任，做到了，心底坦然的毫無缺憾，如此則不求眞平等而自得，一般玩弄婦女的男子，亦無不肅然起敬了！</p>
<p>愛美的心，是人人所有的，而婦女是尤甚，我們需要的美，正如餓求食，渴求飲，但是我們所需要的美，决非表面的，而是要內心的，表面的美，是暫時的；內心的美，是永久存在的，誰不愛美的臉兒，但臉兒是不久便要衰老誰不愛美麗的聲音，但聲音不久要改變，這都是表面的美，不能持久的。</p>
<p>婦女們我們如果能把上面的三項做到，又何患他人不予以相當同情呢？</p>
<h3>婦女節創導者克洛拉·蔡特金事略（1857-1933）</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>—寫在“三八”節的前面—</p>
<p>國際婦女節，是婦女從舊禮教的桎梏中，爭得獨立人格的紀念日，也是婦女求得解放最光榮的一頁，所以每年遇到“三八”節，世界各國的婦女，都有熱烈的紀念大會，這是我們多麼快活的佳節呢！已經得到解放的姊妹們，當然很歡躍，大家跳跳舞，唱唱歌，談談，說說，但是回頭看看中國婦女，因為受着封建社會的茶毒，依然有不少的姊妹們，在過着“非人的生活，”那是何等痛心的事！希望大家踏着以前掙扎的血跡，努力奮鬥！努力邁進！才對得起這位領導我們的克洛拉•蔡特金女士，現在我不妨關於她的事略，介紹給諸位聽聽。</p>
<p>克洛拉·蔡特金女士，是生於一八五七年德國的尼得拉地方，父親是個小學教師，家風樸實，生活在純潔的大自然中，在二十歲的那年，才離開了家庭，進了拉依普的師範學校。當時的德國，正在國力日漸發展，資本主義也日漸成熟，勞資的衝突也就漸漸滋長了，克洛拉女士，在這時，認識了不少俄波的亡命者，加入了社會民主黨，不久她又認識了俄國的亡命革命家沃西普蔡特金·一八七八年德政府頒布了“反社會主義法，”凡是有信仰社會主義的嫌疑者，都被拘捕，沃西普蔡特金也被驅逐出境，所以克洛拉女士跟了沃西普離別了祖國德意志。一八八○年他倆便在瑞士實行同居之愛，不久又到法國巴黎，後來沃西普，又患了不治的重症，她為了病夫和子女二人，不得不教書，翻譯或寫作，來維持他們的生活，於是她嘗盡了異鄉流離的痛苦，同時也受到革命者的物質痛苦，這種痛苦，或許是使她為被壓迫者而奮鬥。</p>
<p>到了一八八九年，沃西普就溘然長逝了。那時，恰巧德國的“反社會主義法”已經取消，克洛拉才帶了兒女，回到故國。不久她加入司徒嘉德城的社會民主黨，一八九二年，她編輯“平等婦女雜誌，”竭力從事於婦女解放運動，為勞働婦女謀福利，她的言論，得到許多人的同情和擁護，這個主筆職務，支持到十三年之久，她闡明了資產階級婦女運動和勞働階級的婦女運動的不同，並且，她更組織不少婦女團體，從事於婦女大衆的眞有名的“倍恩宣言”，反對一般為少數人的利益，而進行最殘酷的戰爭，因此，她又吃了幾個月的官司，但是這種懲罰，反增强了她反對的意志，在當年七月，她又創辦了“國際雜誌。”一九○七年，由她提議在國際社會主義的婦女大會中，建立一個國際婦女社會主義秘書處，同時她被任為秘書。國際婦女會成立在一九○七年三月八日，於是决定此日為“國際婦女節，”這就是“三八”節的由來，或許諸位不知道吧！</p>
<p>一九一七年，俄國革命爆發，她努力為俄國的革命宣傳，當時她已當選為德國第一屆的國會議員，在初次上臺演說的時候，就大膽地表示贊成蘇聯，她的雄辯偉論，振動了全塲的聽衆。一九二○年，她才踏進期望中的蘇聯，這時，蘇聯正在開第九次大會，當她走進克來穆林宮的“斯瓦德洛夫”廳的時候，頓時掌聲雷動，羣衆很熱烈地歡迎。一九三三年，在阿姆斯特所舉行的國際反戰大會中，她從各方面用各種手段來反對第二次世界大戰的必要，“反對戰爭就是反對帝國主義的侵略者”，這是她的唯一口號，本年又重返德國一次，以德高望重的資格，在德國國會中致開會辭，後來再到俄京莫斯科，不久就長眠在那裏了，享年七十有六，參加葬禮者有數十萬人，像俄國要人斯大林，莫洛托夫等都親扶靈柩，將博學多才的世界女革命家安葬在列寗墓之後，眞是極盡死後的哀榮了。</p>
<p>我們從上面的事略看來，她是個全世界婦女的救星，現在她雖然死了，但是我們從桎梏中，求得解放，和獲取平等的地位，她的確是我們唯一的領導者，所以我們應該如何繼續奮鬥，把許多可憐的女同胞，從水深火熱的“非人生活”中救出來，也好使她得到些安慰！關於她一生的著作，有“盧森堡與俄國革命”“現代婦人問題中的婦人勞働”“女子參政問題”“無產婦女運動的起源”“憶列寗”等。親愛的女同胞！後天就是“三八”節紀念日，請大家不要忘記這位勞苦功高的克洛拉·蔡特金女士啊！</p>
<h3>梅開時節</h3>
<p>— 友蘭</p>
<p>春來了，第一件快心的事便是那些暗香疏影的梅花的開放；旭初曾經有一次很得意忘形地說：“我死之後，願意葬在任何一株梅樹的下面”。也足見他的梅癖之深了。</p>
<p>有一個梅花盛開的時節，我約定了旭初同上蘇州廣福那邊去消遣兩三天工夫，原說兩個人去，後來我到了車站，一瞧旭初還帶着一位女性，雖然這情形很突兀，但在這個時代裏，當然也用不到我大驚小怪。於是三個人便一起上了車，歸座之後，旭初少不得就給我介紹道：“這位是徐心影女士，你時常愛瞧中國影片，想來也聽到過伊的名字吧？啊！不錯，怪不得面熟得很，原來是一顆電影界的紅星。</p>
<p>徐女士的本來面目，實在比畫面上更好看，可惜我生平最不會形容女人的相貌，祗知道那一位醜，那一位美，却一些描摹不出來。當然！徐女士是屬於美的一類的，而且總在美的一類中的甲乙等之間。至於旭初究竟怎樣會和她相識，甚至能够請伊同來做旅行件侶的緣故，我不但當時沒有知道，就是到現在，也還很模糊咧！</p>
<p>但那一天他們倆的情景却眞使我感到一種興奮，旭初固然是那樣熱烈地廝緾着她，而她也柔情如水的依戀着旭初；我曾經在梅林內悄悄地窺見他們擁吻過六次或是七次，有一次的時間大約總在五分鐘以上。到回來的時候，旭初的衣襟上，兀是插着那一小枝徐女士所採給他的綠梅，看得像嘉禾章，采玉章一樣的珍視。</p>
<p>此後我們有好久沒有見面，不，見是見到的，只是大家很怱促，不曾講得幾句話，差不多等於不曾見面一樣。這樣不覺便過了兩年，一霎眼又到了梅開時節了，我忽發遊興，想上超山去走一遭，因為知道旭初是梅癖最深的人，便在先幾天打電話去約他；不料他旣不在公事房，再問他的家，又說也搬走了，我當然很詫異，忙去仔細一打聽，才知道他為了和徐女士的戀愛事件，給人丟了石灰包，把兩顆眸子全弄瞎了，事情旣不能再辦，只得鍜羽回鄉。而那徐女士呢？誰還能强迫她隨旭初一起回鄉啊！</p>
<p>這消息完全打斷了我探梅的興緻。</p>
<h3>第六信</h3>
<p>— （卓呆）</p>
<p>B女士</p>
<p>尊函所問：“為什麼近年來上海一帶，人家的花園，都呌日本人建造？”這是一個值得研究的問題。</p>
<p>現在把金地球園林的格式，分起類來，大概可以分為三派：歐美等國的，成為一派，中國的，也自成一派，而日本的，又是一派。造園家為着稱呼的便利起見，那第一派歐美式的園林，呌做整形式，又呌幾何式，又呌圖案式。因為他們不但園林的佈置，都是方方正正，就是一棵樹，也往往會把牠剪成方形。日本的恰巧相反，呌做自然式，一切都模仿天然。我們中國的園林，稱為繪畫式，旣不是整形似的在一片空地上，作什麼圖案，又不是絕對模仿自然，完全與中國的畫一般。如果三者都把畫來譬喻，那末，歐美式的，是用器畫，目本式的，是寫生畫，中國式的，就是中國畫。然像寫生，其實不是完全寫生。</p>
<p>中國的庭園，建築物木多樓臺亭閣，往往排得密密層層，露天的地方並不多，這與現代造園的目的上，完全相反。那歐美和日本的，建築物很少，大部分在露天，與現代的需要很多，而且建築物一多，經費也就大得不得了。</p>
<p>所以近來中國人造園，一來為時代的潮流，不喜歡縮在室內，二來因為經濟關係，不打算一定要有樓臺亭閣那些點綴，三來，舊式的花園，看得也有些厭了，於是不能不變一個方向，採些外國的趣味進去。最初與中國人接觸的當然是上海等處歐美式的庭園；但是這圖案式的東西，充公園還相宜，如果私人的庭園，也仿這格式，不但面積要很大，而且不能喚起中國人的趣味來，不免覺得單調。</p>
<p>倒不如日本式的庭園，容易入眼。一則，東方趣味的成分多，二則，卽使地位極小，也很能佈置，三則，材料人工，都很便宜。（雖然有的也很貴，但是可以設法便宜。）因為有種種關係，所以上海一帶的私人花園，由日本人建造的，很多。我也在上海參觀過四五處，徐家匯路程霖生先生的花園，（好像呌遂吾廬？）也完全是日本格式，面積雖然不大，非常的有曲折，可惜近來不加修理，而樹木，也因着浜內有某工廠傾倒鹽酸水的關係，都枯死了。</p>
<p>但是在上海跟人家佈置花園的日本人，都不是眞的造園專門家，不過是些花樹匠，兼充此職，其中難得有一二個是庭園師。這庭園師，差不多像造房子的作頭，他可以包工建築；但有時他也往往大膽的替人設計，不過這些人設計的，總不免有些俗氣，而且會有不合理的地方。譬如在中國人的庭園中，點綴一個純日本式的石燈籠，那就太惡劣；如果要他想一樣代替的東西，他就沒有這能力了。女士！下一次，我再和你談談三種格式的優劣比較，再會。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>越界築路地段的“市政捐”</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>上海有租界，又有所謂“越界築路地段”。本來，在“越界築路地段”的市政權是屬我國市政府，而兩旁房屋亦釘市界門牌，且均由市財政局派員徵收市政捐，而在馬路亦由市警察局派立崗位，保護治安。如今，突如其來的一個消息，說公共租界當局擬向“越界築路地段”各業主徵收市政捐，並以斷水電作要挾。顯然這一問題已相當地展開了，我們除了希望市政當局為我國主權而力爭外，還有如下意見的補充。</p>
<p>關於“越界築路地段”的問題，以前已曾有過“收回越界築路”的交涉，但在市政當局與公共租界當局交涉的結果，却是因為“種種關係，未能得一澈底辦法”，後來且半途停頓了，許久不聽見有什麼“澈底辦法”的解决，一直便是沉寂下去了。不過沉寂下去當然不就是解决，這次公共租界當局的擬向業主徵收市政捐，却正是給我們的很大的教訓：要不是澈底解决，那就是沒有解决。這是第一點。</p>
<p>其次，這一次的公共租界徵收市政捐的手段，還是傳統的“以斷水电要挾”的方法。這方法已曾給我們不少的教训，而每一次還是讓步和屈服，因為在商人方面，這是一件很大的要挾，他們不能一日無水無電，所以卽使稍為吃虧，也情願馬虎了事。此次“市政捐”事件已有了類似的結果。由此可知此次的結局又有蹈覆轍的危險了，如果不急謀整個解决，那又是一件多可怕的事啊。按“越界築路地段”的水電問題，“在北四川路越界築路一帶，所有水電，大半已由閘北水電公司所供給，在滬西方面，電氣供給”，只“由市政府核准另設立滬西電氣公司承辦”，但是這一切都是“遠水救不得近火”，而少數業主竞不能不“忍痛接受”，這不又是解决的不能澈底的過錯嗎？</p>
<p>不過，我們對那“忍痛接受”的少數業主是不能有所諒解的。越界築路地段的“市政捐”問題，是關乎我國主權的被侵害的，“忍痛接受”旣不能保國家主權，且有防碍於“力爭”的進行，這無論如何是一個“苟且偷安”的蠢方法：同時，越界築路地段的“市政捐”也是整個的，不可分的，决不是少數“忍痛接受”便可以部份解决。而且，“忍痛接受”也只會引起更大的“痛”，而决不是就消滅了“痛”。所以，希望當局在“力爭”當中，不可忘記說服這一班願意“屈服”的“忍痛”的少數業主；同時我們更希望使他們之所以“忍痛”的理由加以分析且解决。不過，如今“亡羊補牢”還是時候，我們不但要妥善解决“市政捐”的糾紛，而且還得舊事前提地清理了那“收回越界築路”這一陳年的檔案。</p>
<h3>大上海的陷阱</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>有位女士，寫了篇“報告文學”，報告她在這個大上海求職而三遇陷阱的事實。她所遇到的第一個陷阱是：弄堂小學。原來那二十七歲的校長之所以要聘請女教員者，是為了準備做他的妻子；第二個陷阱是：騙取現金保證的小醫院；第三個陷阱是：和妓女不相上下的嚮導員。</p>
<p>那位女士當去接洽女教員，立在一所二幢房子的校所前，曾這末發呆着：“一所二幢石庫門的校舍，就能算是個高尚的教育機關！恐怕是個騙取學費的學店吧！我就忍心去做個教育界中的敗類麼？”這是，第一，弄堂小學是不是完全是“騙取學費的學店”？因此第二，即使教育界完全是敗類，然而我們能忍心看這些敗類在教育界裏麼？我們如果有點積極性，我們是要深入敗類陣營中去，“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”？我們絕對不能戴了白手套，讓敗類永遠敗類下去的。</p>
<p>當那位女士逃出那間招請嚮導員的屋子，她是如何的憤怒呵！她寫道：“這時意識告訴我，這是强迫我出賣肉體和靈魂的陷阱，什麼是職員，簡直是和妓女不相上下的嚮導員啦！我是死也不願的，無論如何窮困，怎能和這班獸類似的人去纏，來污濁我純潔高尚的人格。”這里第一，“這班獸類似的人”，是出自甘願的呢？還是也和那位女士一樣，為飢寒所迫，出於無法？第二，“這班獸類似的人”，眞的人格污濁了麼？人格的污濁抑或高尚，是不是因為肉體的出賣呢？多少女性，為了貞節觀念，而忍凍受飢，甚至因失身而羞憤自殺的不知多少！這是封建的貞操觀，不知害死了多少人？同時，這封建的貞操觀，又不知把多少可憐的婦女，被當作“獸類似的人”呵！我要為那些可憐的婦女們，大聲呼呌抗議！</p>
<p>那位女士雖三遇陷阱，然一點不灰心，她“更加發憤用功的自條以希望學得技能，能進正當之職業機關，用自己的力，來換取自己的生活”，這誠然是可嘉許的，然而失業人數，與日俱增，這恐怕不是個幻想吧？又何况月下的所謂“正當的职業機關”，對於女性又有多少不跟陷阱相類似呢？</p>
<p>女人們的苦難。……</p>
<h3>春風得意</h3>
<p>— 崢嶸</p>
<p>事業得意</p>
<p>“春風得意”這句話有兩種意思：一種意思就是說“春風是和煦而得意”，一種意思就是說“春風的時候人的事業正可以得意”。</p>
<p>假使人在這春風醉人的時候，精神疲倦，身體衰弱，那他就要辜負了這大好的春光，他的事業更談不到“得意”了。</p>
<p>所以凡是體軀不健的人，應該趁着這陽春的時候，調服滋補有效的藥品，譬如是血份不足的，就應調服補血的“自來血”。肺氣不足的，就應調服“五洲乳白魚肝油”，或“地球牌麥精魚肝油”。因為這三種都是著名的補品，平素有“補品三傑”的美譽，現在有許多社會上的成功者，他們平常都調服這種補品，健進他們的身體。我想病弱者如果能聽從我的話，每日調服，那麼在今年的時候，他就可以轉弱為强，到明年春風的時候，他的事業也必定可以得意了。</p>
<h3>暮天懷遠</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>爬伏在村會頂上的烟囱，噴起一縷縷白烟，慢慢飄散在暮空的烟雲裏，化成難遮的灰頹情調；西山托着將殘的夕照，聳立的物體的影子，在地上更拖得長了，沒有晚霞的美景，這是愁人的黃昏。</p>
<p>望不盡的田野，望不斷的麥苗，繡成了無涯的綠意，傾瀉滔天的碧浪。爬伏的丘陵，墳起的土墩，土墩上的烏柏早飄盡了紅顏的落葉，賸得粗笨的枯幹，在那裏惋憐青春之消逝；滿含詩意的紅葉，於今也悄悄偎貼着泥土，再沒有憑吊的詩人，來此唱秋波臨去了。沙塵枯葉像妒恨桃花的專美，唦唦捲起一陣旋風，打落紛紛的花朶。任落英的啜泣，任枯樹的無聲嘆氣，只丟下冷風的嘲弄，再沒有嗚虫歡欣的樂奏。袤草綠不透蔓延的生意，悄悄歎出命運的凄凉。遠處的城垣古道，在夕陽裏顯着古老不堪的哀怨，與亘古的頹然。</p>
<p>在目光所能見及的這角落裏，顯現得多境寂寥單調。</p>
<p>由山崖田地闢成的紅泥馬路上，不時有飛馳而遇的汽車——或者就是這角天地裏竟有的活力的點綴。憑立鄉道的村舍，籬門外依倚着一顆古老的心；凄</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>萋的鬢角，皺疊的無限懷念憂愁的紋溝：都寫出這個心神的凌亂。運着生命裏所有殘餘的力，緊注着遠方的天海，天海裏談素的雲彩，輕輕地飛過一個山巔又一個嶺，慈母的心，在晚風浮雲之間，更凄然無際了。</p>
<p>古道旁，汽車上，她懇切地尋求一個她旦暮愁牽的對像——冉冉自遠道歸來的幼子，來安慰暮年人的寂寞，温回她早經失去的熱情。</p>
<p>昏鴉陣陣噪過天邊，母喚着兒投進遠山的長林裏。這充滿孝心的慈鳥，她們的家，該多麽熱情舒適，充溢着天倫團聚的快樂；暮年人的家裏；却只有煢煢的燈火，凄凄伴着孤單的瘦影；慢慢的長夜，難尋遊子歸家的好夢。往往會因爲西風的擊瓦，野狗的狂吠，殘葉的蕭索；被認爲有遊子連夜歸來的履歩：暮年的慈母會衝開深夜的陰寒與恐怖，幽幽在無底的黑暗裏待到天明。但是難眠輾轉，空數盡每一下時間的廻轉，聽殘更漏的哀訴；霜華重露，只有她獨領人間的凄寂。這暮天，這静悄悄的鄉道，有誰來投給她一絲兒慰藉！？</p>
<p>夕陽收盡了最後的光彩，暮色一歩歩地加濃了。灰黯的夜霧，爬上人家的屋頂，爬近暮年人的身旁；遮糢糊了遠山的輪廓，遮濃厚了頽城古道的岑寂。烏柏的頽枝上，幾點凄宿的亂鳥，往往會因爲一陣風響，一聲狗呌，便不安地離開枝頭，向昏茫的暮空裏打一次徘徊，哀哀地像唱出無家無恃的疾苦，一聲聲呌痛暮年人的心。</p>
<p>晚風撩起驚人的怪呌，掀起暮年人的衣角，拂亂斑斑的髮鬢，使老弱的心神，在陰冷的威脅裏抖索。……但暮年的慈母，依然不忍離開這個處所；彷彿昏茫的暮色，會迷失遊子歸家的道路。</p>
<h3>紫羅蘭</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>已經記不起在什麽時候，自己也開始了愛花。</p>
<p>也許，近來的生活太閒散了吧，往往在無事的時候，總想找一點適合於個性的消遣，或者是自己所歡喜的娱樂，來作爲生活中的點綴；可是，能够適合自己個性和我所歡喜的消遣或娱樂，這里實在太少了。</p>
<p>爲了自己的肺病，醫生曾經指定一個很悠長的時期呌我静養，並且他還禁止我閲報看書和寫文章。於是，因爲希望延續自己的生命，便無可如何地被逼廹着回到了故鄉。在鄉村里，生活是非常單調的，没有娱樂，没有消遣，書報是好久不接近了，文章就是不禁止，也懶得作。一切，只彷彿隔絶在另外一個世界里；况且自己的一舉一動都要受着家人們的監視，那簡直是與在牢監里吃官司差不多。</p>
<p>於是，就這樣地開始了愛花。</p>
<p>我們家里原有一個庭園，但是一向没有人去整理，花徑不掃，園門常掩，荒蕪得太不像樣了。</p>
<p>終於爲了自己也没有地方消磨那一天一天的無聊光陰，就把那園子整理了一番，覓了許多奇花異卉和常綠樹來，栽植在里面。一年來，這寂寞的庭園，居然也成一個很活潑的花圃。</p>
<p>在淸晨，每當鷄鳴聲蕩漾在薄霧的空氣中時，園里的每一株花剛沐着晶瑩的朝露里，我便站在花前，樹下，鑒賞着每一株花摇曳着的惺忪的姿態，輕輕地在熹微的晨光中擺動，像是一個妍麗多姿的少女，她在含情脈脈地，微笑的向着我招手。</p>
<p>去年有一位朋友送我一盆紫羅蘭；我把一半仍舊留在盆中，將另一半却分了出來移栽在庭園里的小池畔。他送給我的時候，正是去年的四月，那青翠碧綠的葉子叢里，爬滿了許多細碎的紫色小花；那花蕚非常奇特，一種馥郁的芬芳播送着，却並没别些花卉那麽帶着誘人的刺激香味。</p>
<p>據説它一年中能發兩次花，這在常綠種里是不可多得的。我很愛它，愛它的有着薔薇的芬芳，但不像薔薇的太艷，有着梅花的堅忍，但比了梅花更淸高。</p>
<p>現在，又是它的開花季節了，在那青翠碧綠的葉子叢里，又爬滿了許多細碎的紫色小花。我愛它在太陽下散着温馨的氣息，也愛它浸潤在雨露下的艷麗姿態。</p>
<p>不論在每天的淸晨或傍晚，我總愛在這園子里留連一回，那幾乎已成了我日常的習慣。</p>
<p>紫羅蘭的顔色是不艷不淡的，紫羅蘭的芬芳是香而不烈的，它正彷彿是一位淡裝雅緻而静嫻的姑娘。在我的庭園里，我像愛護自己的愛人一樣，小心地灌溉着它，培植着它；冬天，晚上給它用稻草遮蓋起來，夏天，在日中却用簾子替它擋了過烈的陽光，我看着它一天比一天的繁榮，由一小叢變了一大叢，再將它分植了許多地方。</p>
<p>最近病漸漸地痊愈了，爲了生活，爲了負担，重新又離開了故鄉，離開了那個心愛的庭園，特别值得依戀的是那叢可愛的紫羅蘭。</p>
<p>春天了，紫羅蘭無恙耶，悵望着天涯，我像懷念愛人那樣不禁傷感起來。</p>

<h3>Dispute Over the Petition of Landowners in Beijing Who Have Had Their Land Requisitioned</h3>
<p>Guards Prevented Them in Vain, and They Poured in; Petitioners Were Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>(Nanjing) About 200 landowners whose land was requisitioned at Tongjimen Daxiao Field petitioned the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM on the 5th, demanding an increase in land prices, a re-measurement, and the immediate payment of the entire land price. The guards of the Municipal Government asked the petitioners to elect representatives to enter the government to state their case, but the petitioners insisted on entering the government as a whole. The prevention was ineffective, and the gate guard signs were torn off, and everyone poured in. The military police heard the news and went to the Municipal Government in full force to maintain order. A petitioner, Hu Ligui, was beaten, injured, and fainted. Wang Shufang, Secretary Wang of the Municipal Government, and others came out to talk to the petitioners. (1) This case is for land requisition on behalf of the Military Affairs Commission, and the price is not low. If the landowners believe that it is too low, the Municipal Government can forward the matter for verification. (2) If there are errors in the measurement, the surveying was done by the Military Affairs Commission using aerial surveying, and the Municipal Land Administration Bureau carried out the cleaning. If there are errors, the affected landowners can individually petition for re-measurement. (3) According to precedent, all banner land property in Beijing is 40% official and 60% private, so the land price of banner land can only be issued at a 60% discount. Zhang Peijin and others did not agree with this at the time, saying that the land price must be increased immediately and the method of 40% official and 60% private for banner land must be abolished. Wang repeatedly explained that the Municipal Government had no right to increase the land price, but there was no result. Kong, the police chief of the Third Police Bureau, had his clothes torn by the petitioners. They remained at odds until 4:00 PM when they all left the Municipal Government. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Meeting Revises and Passes the Implementing Regulations of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 93rd meeting on the morning of the 5th, with 65 members including Chen Changheng present. Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. The meeting revised and passed the Implementing Regulations of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law drafted by the Finance Committee, and resolved that the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law should be implemented on January 1, 1938, and that the budget and its execution for the year 1937 should continue to be handled as usual, and should be submitted to the National Government for approval and compliance. During the discussion of the case, a fierce debate arose among the committees regarding judicial expenses. Article 17 of the original draft stipulated that "The expenses of the central government in exercising judicial power in the localities shall be borne by the central government, and all judicial revenues shall belong to the central government. If the revenues and expenditures are insufficient, the localities may be ordered to assist as appropriate." Ma Yinchu, Zhao Huan, Xiao Shuyu, and others argued that the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law had stipulated that the expenses required by the central government to exercise judicial power in the localities should be borne by the central government, but now the implementing regulations stipulated that if these expenses were insufficient, the localities could be ordered to assist as appropriate, and that there were obvious discrepancies in the legislation before and after. Moreover, since all judicial revenues now belonged to the central government, it would be even more burdensome for the localities to bear the insufficient judicial expenditures, and the central government seemed to be infringing on the localities. They all advocated deleting the article. Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, and others argued that the current shortfall in local judicial expenses was being assisted by the localities, and that without this provision, the central government would have to increase an expense, which the national treasury might not be able to afford. Therefore, they advocated maintaining the original proposal, but Chen advocated making textual revisions to the article, and Wei advocated adding a time limit to the section on ordering local assistance, limiting it to three years. In addition, Chen Guyuan also proposed an amendment. After the chairman submitted it for a vote, the result was that the proposal to delete the article by Ma and others was passed by a majority, and the article was deleted. The full text consists of 19 articles, with the main points as follows: ㊀The percentage of income tax distributed to provinces, cities, and counties by the central government in the first year of implementation of these regulations shall be determined by the central government in accordance with the standards stipulated in Article 4 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, and shall be redetermined every three years thereafter. As for the portion of income and inheritance taxes distributed to provinces, cities, and counties, it shall be allocated by the central government in a unified manner. ㊁The portion of business tax distributed to counties and cities shall be determined by the respective provincial governments and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. ㊂The original tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, and other taxes of a business tax nature in various localities shall be changed to business tax, and the tooth stamp tax, pawn stamp tax, slaughter household license tax, and other taxes of a business license tax nature shall be changed to business license tax. ㊃The land tax and land improvement tax shall be determined in the first year of implementation of these regulations in accordance with the standards stipulated in Article 7 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law. The percentage allocated to the province shall be proposed by the county and city governments and submitted to the provincial government for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. The percentage of land tax allocated to the central government by cities directly under the Executive Yuan shall be proposed by the city government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and shall be redetermined every three years thereafter. In the provinces, cities, and counties that have not implemented land tax in accordance with the Land Law, the allocation of land tax shall be subject to the preceding provisions. ㊄Provinces, cities, and counties may continue to collect and allocate deed tax in areas where land tax has not been implemented in accordance with the Land Law. ㊅The original boat tax and vehicle tax in various provinces, cities, and counties shall be changed to boat and vehicle license tax. Usage fees may be collected for boats and vehicles passing through for the improvement and equipment of waterways and roads. ㊆Provinces, cities, and counties shall immediately abolish any double taxation or surcharges on existing central taxes, but if there are special circumstances where funds for compensation have not yet been raised, the Executive Yuan may be requested to abolish them in phases, or the central government may take them back for reorganization and provide subsidies, up to a maximum of three years. ㊇Special monopoly industries established by provinces, cities, and counties shall be taken over by the central government in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, but if funds for compensation for the original monopoly income have not yet been raised, the central government may subsidize them, for a maximum of three years. ㊈When provinces, cities, and counties levy special taxes in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, the project plans, expenditure estimates, and collection methods shall be submitted to the higher-level government for approval before they can be included in the budget. ㊉The award money stipulated in Article 19 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law shall be limited to informants, personnel directly involved in investigation and enforcement, and military police. ㊉㊀When provinces, cities, and counties stipulate exclusive prices in accordance with the provisions of Article 22 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, if their legislative bodies have not yet been established, they shall submit them to the competent higher-level authority for approval. ㊉㊁The matters exempt from customs duties stipulated in Article 28 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law shall be temporarily subject to the existing precedents and methods for exemption from customs duties before the Customs Law is promulgated. ㊉㊂The banks exempt from bank income tax stipulated in Article 30 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law shall be limited to those with completely government-owned shares, unless otherwise stipulated by law. ㊉㊃The amount of subsidies and assistance provided by the provincial government to its subordinate counties and cities shall be determined first and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. ㊉㊄The amount of allocation of income tax, inheritance tax, business tax, land tax, and land improvement tax, and the amount of government subsidies and assistance, shall be notified to the lower-level governments by the higher-level governments one month before the budget is prepared. ㊉㊅When provinces, cities, and counties borrow money in accordance with the provisions of Article 42 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law, if their legislative bodies have not yet been established, they shall first obtain the approval of the higher-level government. ㊉㊆Governments at all levels shall gradually increase the expenditures for education, culture, economic construction, health, medical treatment, childcare, relief, etc. stipulated in Article 49 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law to the standard amount stipulated in that article within five years.

<h3>Economy and Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In modern international relations, economy and diplomacy have formed a very important link. Not only is it important, but this link is also very subtle. The increase in economic relations between countries sometimes indicates the development of genuine friendship, and sometimes, on the contrary, indicates the deepening of aggression and domination. Therefore, in international relations, we often hear the beautiful term "economic cooperation." In some cases, it can be expressed as a sincere diplomatic attitude, while in other cases, it can be seen as a cover for aggressive diplomatic activities.</p>
<p>Because economy and diplomacy are so closely related, the recent visit to China by the Japanese economic delegation has attracted special attention from all parties. This delegation is led by Kenji Kodama, chairman of the Japan-China Trade Association. The importance of its representatives and the news publicity before its departure make us aware that its mission is by no means limited to "economy." According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 3rd, Kodama said in his interview with reporters, "The two major countries in East Asia should focus on the overall situation, cooperate with each other, and strive to ease various frictions and eliminate the current unpleasant situation as soon as possible to make it clear." He also mentioned "economic cooperation," believing that now "the general public sincerely feel that the improvement of friendly relations between China and Japan and the harmony of the two peoples are prerequisites." These words coincide with the rhythm revealed by Prime Minister Hayashi in his policy speech not long ago. From this, we can imagine that the diplomatic significance of Kodama's economic delegation's visit to China is actually greater than its economic significance.</p>
<p>In a few days, this "economic envoy" group will be visiting our country. To be honest, we, the generally generous and kind Chinese people, always welcome guests from afar. We also try our best to trust the meaning of Kodama's expressed "extremely innocent" intentions. However, to be more honest, in recent years, we, the generous and kind Chinese people, have gained a lot of bitter lessons in the great changes of the world and in our own experiences. For example, the close relationship between economy and diplomacy is one of the lessons we have learned. And before the arrival of this distinguished guest, we have to recall this lesson.</p>
<p>Speaking from our own experience, in recent years, we have often heard the beautiful term "economic cooperation." It seems to be more popular in North China than elsewhere. But what are the benefits that North China has received from "economic cooperation"? The first is the seizure of customs, the second is the rampant smuggling, and the third, fourth, and all subsequent results are that our economic resources are gradually becoming appendages to someone else's "quasi-wartime economic system." We certainly do not want to suspect others' "malice," but we have already felt a cruel lesson that goes beyond "malice" under the beautiful term "economic cooperation." In the broader aspects of the world, if we want to briefly mention one or two examples out of countless ones, Cuba in the Americas would be one. The economic relationship between the United States and Cuba is the closest. But all the sweetness of Cuba, the "sugar bowl," is tasted by the Americans. What Cuba itself gets is only the bitter taste of armed intervention.</p>
<p>Thus, the enthusiastic expectations for this "friendly country" guest, combined with the cruel lessons of reality, make us unable to be optimistic. However, Kodama's "courageous" conclusion in his interview with reporters, saying that it is necessary to firmly respect China's territorial sovereignty in politics, is worth pondering. Because without this fundamental political condition, so-called "economic cooperation" is indeed just a cover to achieve certain diplomatic purposes. If Kodama has a sincere feeling for this conclusion, we hope that he will either first take the road through our Northeast and then go south when he comes to our country, or go to the outside of the Great Wall to take a look after visiting our South. Because that place belongs to China's territorial sovereignty, but now it is planted with the flags of other countries.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Decides on Measures to Save the Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Saving Budget of 6 Billion Francs; No Issuance of Public Debt Except for National Defense; Private Individuals Permitted to Freely Import Gold</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of Ministers recently discussed financial issues at its meeting this morning and issued a public statement stating that France's financial policy is still based on the currency agreement reached by Britain, France, and the United States on September 25 of last year. Therefore, it does not intend to impose controls on exchange matters, but will request the Bank of France to allow private individuals to freely import gold and freely buy and sell gold coins domestically. The Bank of France will purchase gold from the 8th of this month according to the daily market price. The Council of Ministers also appointed Bank of France Governor Labeyrie, former Vice Governor Professor Rist, Baudouin, General Manager of the Banque de l'Indochine, and Roueff, Deputy Director of the Exchange Equalization Fund of the Ministry of Finance, to form a committee to manage the exchange equalization fund to maintain the current price of the franc and to monitor the domestic public debt market. In terms of finance, the Council of Ministers instructed all competent authorities not to request additional funds beyond the regular budget and decided to reduce the funds contained in the 1937 budget by 6,000,000,000 francs, while stipulating that no other debts should be issued during this fiscal year except for national defense bonds. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fifth)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Finance recently issued a public statement stating that the Council of Ministers will take some appropriate measures regarding the financial situation at its meeting tomorrow, but their nature will not be exceptional. As for the rumors that the government will stabilize the price of the franc and take new legislative plans in finance, and that Bank of France Governor Labeyrie will resign, they are not true. In addition, responsible parties have also firmly denied that the cabinet will be reorganized and said that the government does not intend to appoint new cabinet members, and there will be no changes to the current list of cabinet members. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed financial sources recently declared that the Council of Ministers will decide on the following measures at its meeting tomorrow:</p>
<p>㊀Stabilize the price of the franc according to the current parity.</p>
<p>㊁Take some important measures in finance, but any policy that aims to induce foreign exchange managers will not be adopted.</p>
<p>㊂Establish a Financial Advisory Committee to assist the Ministry of Finance and monitor the financial situation. Former Vice Governor of the Bank of France, the famous economist Rist, and Baudouin, former Director of the Ministry of Finance, will be hired as committee members.</p>
<p>In addition, financial figures firmly deny the rumors that the cabinet will be reorganized and that Bank of France Governor Labeyrie will resign. Also, Finance Minister Olivol held talks with Gayot and Vallière, the chairmen of the finance committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, this evening to prepare for the measures to be taken at tomorrow's Council of Ministers meeting. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Council of Ministers is scheduled to discuss financial issues at 10:00 this morning. Well-informed sources believe that as a result of the meeting, the gold content of the franc will still be based on the current standard of 0.046 grams, and the layer that the rightists have spread, that is, it should be reduced to 0.044 grams, is not accurate. In addition, the talks held yesterday by the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, and the US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, are generally believed to be related to the issue of franc stability, but officials refuse to express their opinions. As for the government, it will avoid using various methods such as controlling exchange rates and controlling the flow of private funds. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fifth)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau held talks with the French Ambassador Bonnet today. Afterwards, Morgenthau issued a statement to the press stating that the US government is very concerned about the French financial situation and that he had demonstrated this during his meeting with Ambassador Bonnet. "We will continue to do our best to cooperate economically with France, but the spirit of our various existing laws must still be observed."

<p>(Paris) The Bank of France recently released its weekly report.

<h3>British House of Commons Passes the National Defense Loan Bill on Third Reading</h3>
<p>Churchill Also Spoke in Support; Germany Has 1,500 Heavy Cannons</p>
<p>(London) The British National Defense Loan Bill has been passed on third reading in the House of Commons today. The bill grants the government the right to borrow 400 million pounds within five years. When the bill was proposed for third reading, the Labor Party moved to abolish it, but the parliament finally passed it by 241 votes to 117 votes. Thereupon, the bill was transferred to the House of Lords. The most noteworthy speech in today's debate was the great statesman Churchill expressing his delight at the government's measures to reorganize the military. He said that the government's five-year military plan, the greatness of Britain's financial resources, the support of all parties and factions, and the welcome of all countries in the world, especially small countries, are sufficient to prove that it is in the interest of all autonomous regions and foreign countries to follow suit.</p>
<p>Churchill further said that Britain's current diplomatic policy is based on the League of Nations Covenant and the special agreement between Britain and France, which is what the public wants. If Britain can continue to implement its national defense policy for four or five years, then Britain will be in a safer and more suitable position since Germany reorganized its military.</p>
<p>Churchill continued that the current air force estimate has not yet been submitted to the parliament. He said that judging from the current situation, the air force estimate will require about 60 to 70 million pounds to be allocated from public debt.</p>
<p>Churchill expressed regret that the government's proposal did not include the number of armaments that can be obtained in the military construction program and their specific dates. It is said that Germany, in addition to the heavy cannons that have already been installed, still has 1,500 heavy cannons. He asked when Britain will have 1,500 reliable and latest heavy cannons and trained soldiers and appropriate equipment.</p>
<p>Churchill further declared that the British House of Commons can no longer continue to ignore the great problem of national security, especially after the government has admitted that its predictions were wrong. He asked the government whether it could guarantee that the strength of the British Air Force would increase this year, and that the difference between its current strength and that of the German Air Force would not be too great, or that the German Army would not permanently maintain its superiority over France. Churchill further said that today's understanding between Britain and France is nothing less than a defensive alliance for those who carry out aggression without provocation, and the friendship between the two countries is the greatest guarantee for the continued existence of peace or mutual survival.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain then spoke after Churchill and concluded the debate. He said that the parliament's discussion has fully demonstrated that the House of Commons has a real, universal, and fundamental understanding of the need for national military reorganization. Although the opposition party claimed that Britain's military equipment exceeded the needs of reality, and said that when Britain was attacked, other countries would rise up to help, etc., at the same time, when other countries were attacked, Britain would rise up to help them, so Britain's burden has increased rather than decreased.</p>
<p>Chamberlain further stated that Britain has no obligation under the League of Nations Covenant to assist other countries with force when they are attacked.</p>
<p>Chamberlain did not reply, expressing his deep belief that the military policy pursued by the British government is a necessary preliminary step before the final period of military reduction. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the fourth)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Budget Published</h3>
<p>First-Line Aircraft: 1,500</p>
<p>(London) The Air Force budget has been released today. The gross expenditure totals £88,588,600, and the net expenditure totals £56,500,000. It includes a plan to significantly increase the British Air Force. The main points are summarized as follows: As of April 1, the Air Force will consist of one hundred squadrons within the country, equivalent to twenty squadrons, and twenty-six squadrons serving overseas. The number of officers will increase to 4,640 on the same day, and the number of airmen will increase to 51,000. The strength of the Air Force in the metropolitan area will increase to one hundred and twenty squadrons by the summer, including twenty auxiliary air squadrons. There will be a total of 1,500 aircraft on the first line of battle. These squadrons will be expanded to bring the total strength of front-line aircraft to 1,750, as mentioned in the defense statement last March.</p>
<p>As of December 1, 1936, the strength of the British Air Force was as follows: sixty regular air squadrons serving within the country, sixteen auxiliary air squadrons, twenty squadrons attached to the fleet, and twenty-one squadrons serving overseas. There are currently six factories under construction to manufacture aircraft engines, most of which will be completed within a few months. Two factories for manufacturing aircraft fuselages are also under construction. In addition, new factories for manufacturing aerial propellers and bombs are currently under construction. The budget includes a special subsidy of £26,000,000 related to national defense loans; otherwise, the total would be £82,500,000, an increase of £31,800,000 compared to £50,700,000 in 1936. The difference between gross and net expenditure, £32,088,000, will be covered by £26,000,000 from loans and £6,088,600 from various revenues, such as income from national civil airports and contributions to imperial air defense from autonomous territories and colonial governments. The largest part of the expenditure, apart from the £26,000,000 allocated from loans, is £3,882,000 approved by the Admiralty for air force expenses attached to the fleet.</p>
<p>Civil aviation expenditure is £2,315,000, an increase of £1,555,000 compared to 1936, mainly due to the development of imperial aviation business.</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia Opposes Austrian Restoration</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Issues Statement to Parliament; Members Applaud in Support</p>
<p>⊙Yugoslavia. Regarding the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family in Austria, Yugoslavia has once again expressed its firm opposition. This afternoon, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović gave a speech in Parliament on the diplomatic situation, mentioning Yugoslavia's relationship with Austria, saying, "Certain circles in Austria are currently continuing to promote the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, but we sincerely hope that the responsible persons in Austria will find ways to avoid any actions tending towards restoration, because such actions will inevitably cause serious disturbances in Central Europe." At this point in the Prime Minister's speech, all the members applauded in support. The Prime Minister continued, "The Yugoslav government has always adopted a completely negative attitude towards the restoration of the old Habsburg royal family, and will maintain this attitude in the future." The members applauded and cheered unanimously, demonstrating their firm opposition to the Austrian restoration. In addition, Prime Minister Stojadinović reiterated the Yugoslav government's commitment to the League of Nations and reviewed the friendly relations between Yugoslavia and various European countries, but did not mention the Soviet Union. The Prime Minister first stated that Yugoslavia and France have always maintained a traditional friendship, and there is also a friendly relationship with the United Kingdom, and there is no estrangement with Germany.

Furthermore, Yugoslavia's relationship with the Little Entente, the Balkan Pact, other countries, and Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland is also good. (Central News Agency, 4th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Disturbance Occurs in Morocco</h3>
<p>Spanish Nationalist Army Plans to Protest to Britain and France</p>
<p>⊙Salamanca. The Nationalist Army radio station here broadcast a startling message this afternoon, stating that the Spanish Nationalist Army government has received reports that various activities are taking place in the area bordering Spanish Morocco and French Morocco, with the aim of causing disturbances in Spanish territory so that the French Moroccan authorities can use the pretext of restoring order and preventing native tribes from migrating out of the country to invade Spanish territory. It is alleged that this type of activity violates the international obligations stipulated in the Treaty of Algeciras (signed by Britain, Germany, France, Spain, and other countries on April 7, 1906) and endangers European peace. For this reason, the Nationalist Army government has lodged a protest with each signatory to the treaty, requesting that an international committee be organized immediately to investigate the truth. In addition, the Nationalist Army government will also submit a negotiation on this issue to the London Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee. (Central News Agency, 5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Speech: America's Current Crisis</h3>
<p>Judges Hinder the Interests of Farmers and Workers; the Judicial System Must Be Reformed</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt spoke at the Democratic Party's "Celebration Dinner" tonight, calling on the nation's farmers and workers to support the Supreme Court system reform plan, saying that the majority decisions of the Supreme Court justices have made it impossible for the government to help the nation's farmers and workers, and have jeopardized the Tennessee Valley Authority and Social Security Act. The most pressing issue facing America today is to ensure the economic freedom of farmers, workers, and small business owners, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled the Agricultural Adjustment Act and other laws unconstitutional. In that case, what else can this Congress do? The government has done everything in its power to raise wages, reduce working hours, abolish child labor, and eliminate unfair practices in the business world, but the Supreme Court has repeatedly hindered it, and soon the Railroad Workers' Retirement Act, the National Recovery Act, and the Guffey Coal Act will all be declared invalid. At the same time, the state of New York cannot set a minimum wage for female workers. From this point of view, neither the federal government nor the state government has the right to manage these matters. Then, how should these most difficult factual problems be resolved? Although only two of the locks built by the Tennessee Valley Authority have been completed, the river valley has been spared flooding this year. However, a preliminary court has now issued a ruling to stop the Authority from performing its duties, and its future is unknown. In addition, if the Ohio River Valley and drought-stricken areas are to be dredged and irrigated, this will conflict with the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. In that case, should the lives and property of the people be sacrificed to accommodate the clauses? Therefore, the court's attitude has jeopardized the government's entire plan, such as assistance to the disabled, women, and children, as well as unemployment insurance, old-age security, and deposit insurance. Democrats, for the sake of the entire party and individuals, should remove these obstacles. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Philippine President Quezon Appeals to Americans</h3>
<p>Philippine Economy Is at a Disadvantage; the United States Should Be Responsible for Developing the Philippines</p>
<p>(Washington) Philippine President Quezon gave a speech today, saying that the current economic and political relationship between the Philippines and the United States is absurd. Since the implementation of the Independence Act, the only effect has been to divide the sovereignty of the United States and the Philippine autonomous government. We must correct this in both theory and practice, otherwise the great achievements of the United States in the Philippines will be thrown into a void. If the United States can conclude a reciprocal trade agreement with the Philippines, as the United States has concluded with Cuba, it will benefit both countries. Quezon discussed President Roosevelt's sugar production issue with Agriculture Secretary Wallace this morning and requested the passage of the sugar subsidy bill, but this subsidy has not been extended to the Philippines. However, Quezon said that returning the domestic tax to the Philippines is better than subsidizing Philippine sugar merchants. Quezon continued, when the Philippines approved the Independence Act, it thought that the Act was a treaty between the two countries, and the economic relationship between the two countries would be fixed and unchanged. But soon, the US Congress passed the Coconut Oil Domestic Tax Law, and the sugar production control bill did not stipulate subsidies for Philippine merchants, nor did it state that the domestic tax would be returned to the Philippines. All of this makes Filipinos feel uneasy about the US Congress's attitude towards Philippine trade. Sometimes we are considered part of the United States, and sometimes we are considered uncivilized. Anything that is beneficial to Filipinos is considered uncivilized, and anything that is detrimental to Filipinos seems to be part of the United States. What I am saying is not unfounded, because all Filipinos know to be grateful to the United States. Quezon did not express his opinion on future changes to the Independence Act, only saying that the United States should be responsible for developing the Philippines, but one of the two governments must have the right to handle it freely. Currently, the powers of the two governments are very confused, and we should find a way to save it. This speech was delivered at a welcome meeting of the National Press Club, attended by 2,000 journalists, as well as Under Secretary of State Sayre, US Military Advisor to the Philippines General MacArthur, and many of Quezon's entourage. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Foreign Policy Research Association's weekly report published an article by柏波, stating that after President Roosevelt's talks with Philippine President Quezon and US Military Advisor to the Philippines General MacArthur, the US foreign policy towards the Philippines will be clarified. The results of the US-Philippine economic conference may determine the fate of the Philippine autonomous government. If the Philippine economy is not greatly adjusted to compensate for the lost US market, Filipinos may fall into social and political turmoil. The way to maintain the stability of the Philippine government is to amend the articles of the Independence Act, allowing Filipinos to increase tariffs, and providing Filipinos with technical and financial assistance to develop agriculture and industry, or to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement with Filipinos. As for military plans, they will constitute a serious danger, because this military organization may not be able to resist naval blockade, but can be used to create a dictatorial politics.麦克纳's succession as US High Commissioner to the Philippines is ominous. His proximity to the US Army faction may lead him to abuse his power, sacrificing urgent social plans to promote military plans. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Ship Cash to the United States</h3>
<p>15 Million Yuan; More Will Be Shipped Later</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government has decided to ship the first batch of cash, 50 million yuan, abroad. This cash was purchased by the government from the public before the gold export ban and the promulgation of the Bank of Japan Gold Purchase Law in April 1934, and stored in the Bank of Japan. After being shipped to the United States, it will be exchanged for US currency and deposited in the New York branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank, and used as the government's foreign payment when necessary. This cash will be shipped in installments. The first shipment will load 18.5 million yuan in cash held by the Osaka Mint onto the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) Asama Maru. The ship will depart from Kobe on the 9th and is scheduled to arrive in San Francisco on the 24th. The insurance premium will be borne by the government. (5th, Domei)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Yuki, in order to prevent the decline of exchange rates and maintain the standard, decided to ship gold to the United States and has obtained cabinet approval. He issued the following statement on the 4th: The government believes it is necessary to maintain Japan's current exchange rate standard and has always taken appropriate measures to this day. However, since last year, merchants have speculatively imported goods, causing import exchange rates to increase sharply for a time. This time, it is considered appropriate to replenish foreign funds, so it has been decided to ship cash worth 50 million yuan to the United States in several installments. Furthermore, the government now believes that it is necessary to ship a considerable amount of cash to the United States when necessary. Needless to say, this method has no impact on Japan's legal tender reserves. (5th, Domei)</p>
<h3>New York Mayor Ridicules Hitler as a Brown-Shirted Madman in Speech to Jews</h3>
<p>Germany Protests to the United States for Insulting Its Leader; US State Department Declares It Will Investigate and Respond</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to local newspapers, at a meeting of the women's group of the American Jewish Congress, New York Mayor La Guardia gave a speech mentioning Chancellor Hitler, calling him a "brown-shirted madman who endangers European peace." People here are very angry, and the press has unanimously criticized it. The Nazi Party's official newspaper published this news on the front page, with the following headline in large print: "The Jewish Mayor of New York Insults the German Chancellor with Obscene Words." The newspaper's editorial stated, "Because La Guardia insulted the German Chancellor, we must ask the US government how it will ensure that its territory respects the most basic international etiquette." (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The German government today protested to the State Department through its ambassador to the United States against New York Mayor La Guardia's speech. It is claimed that La Guardia, in a speech to the women's department of the American Jewish Congress, proposed setting up a "chamber of horrors" at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, the most important exhibit of which should be German Chancellor Hitler. After receiving the protest, Secretary of State Hull informally expressed his apology for the content of the speech and stated that he had thoroughly investigated the truth of the matter. However, observers said that the State Department has no control over the statements made by local government officials. It is recalled that last year, when the German ship Bremen was in New York, anti-Nazi elements boarded the ship and rioted, and several people were arrested. Later, a judge released them in court, and called the German flag a "black flag of pirates." Germany also protested, and the State Department apologized, but also stated that the federal government could not interfere with the officials of local governments. (4th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) New York Mayor La Guardia himself, after hearing the news of the German government's protest, quipped, "This is absolutely correct, they should protest, because as far as I know, there is not a single artist or sculptor in the world who can depict the Nazi government's dignitaries, Hitler himself, or the German government, so vividly. My words and descriptions of Hitler have not even reached a fraction of his true self, so it is right to provoke the German government's protest." (4th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Compatriots in Northeast China Are Brutally Trampled Upon by Ronin and Traitorous Scoundrels</h3>
<p>Ronin and Traitorous Scoundrels Extort Valuables from Good People Under the Protection of the Military Police</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Our more than 30 million compatriots in Northeast China have been subjected to the brutal rule of the Japanese puppet regime and trampled underfoot for more than five years. As if this were not enough, a certain military police unit colludes with ronin and traitorous scoundrels who have lost all conscience to exploit the good people, causing innocent people to be unable to live or die. All kinds of tragic situations are indescribable. For example, a certain military police officer in Shenyang colluded with ronin and traitorous scoundrels, totaling more than 40 people, to extort valuables and cash from good people. From July of last year to February of this year, the number of good people who have been victimized is countless, causing resentment among the four classes of people. The matter has become serious. Later, a senior officer of the military police headquarters learned of this and said that it was detrimental to the military's reputation. He used a trick, falsely claiming to report it, and did not admit that the certain military police officer had committed this act, blaming all the guilt on the ronin and traitorous scoundrels. Among the more than 40 people who were reported, it was believed that there were secret agents of the pseudo-military police. In reality, when extorting valuables from good people, some wore military police uniforms and some held official documents and name cards. Their actions included intimidation and robbery, or falsely accusing people of communicating with the volunteers and extorting wealth, ranging from several thousand yuan to as little as several dozen yuan. If good people resisted slightly, they would immediately suffer disaster. The names of the ronin and traitorous scoundrels who were reported are listed below: (1) Cang Yi Iwao, 27 years old; Ban Ying Fu, 27 years old; Kobayashi Saichiro, 28 years old; Saito Hiroo, 39 years old; Kumano Seitaro, 37 years old; Uchiyama Nakamasa, 32 years old; Yamashita Haruichi, 32 years old; Aoki Wazaburo, 43 years old; Yamahata Yoshio, 27 years old; (2) Koreans: Kim Ki-jeom, 21 years old; Zou Yushan, 22 years old; Lee Jung-hak, 23 years old; (3) Traitorous Scoundrels: Zhang Xingya, 35 years old; Fu Yingqiao, 30 years old; Li Zichen, 18 years old; Tian Zhendong, 23 years old; He Fengjun, 31 years old; Wang Mingshan, 24 years old; Zhao Guixuan, 26 years old; Li Wenyou, 23 years old; Liu Mingyuan, 33 years old; Dai Changzhong, 31 years old; Chen Chunfang, 34 years old; Wang Mingchang, 38 years old; Chen Shituan, 22 years old; Gao Yongku, 26 years old; Chen Futang, 30 years old; Zhao Fuchun, 34 years old; Wang Zhenyu, 29 years old; Yi Wanjia, 40 years old; Yu Hongtao, 49 years old; Tian Baorong, 24 years old. Among the above people, some do work in a certain military police unit, and some are plainclothes military police. Most of the rest are unemployed vagrants. Among them, there are also employees of companies and shops, who also have the mission of the military police unit. On the Korean side, they are all unemployed ronin. Among the traitorous scoundrels, the members are the most mixed, such as district chiefs, police officers, teachers, inn waiters, soldiers, rickshaw pullers, and merchants. The places where victims are located, in addition to Shenyang city and township, also include Hailong County, Qingyuan County, Liaoyang County, and the pseudo-Andong Province, Tonghua County, Andong County, and towns. The number is incalculable. As for the entire Northeast, there are countless similar situations that have not yet been revealed to the world.</p>
<h3>After the Fall of the "Chang Geng" Aircraft into the River, Both Passenger and Pilot Drowned</h3>
<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Government Graciously Commemorates Dr. Wu Bofan; Officials Dispatched to Assist with Post-Mortem Affairs</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Southwest China Airlines "Chang Geng" aircraft, en route from Guangzhou to Guangxi on the 22nd, encountered fog and crashed in Sanshui County, with the plane and all aboard sinking into the river, as previously reported. Due to severe weather that day, the plane was forced to descend. However, while attempting to land on a sugarcane field, the aircraft struck a river embankment and flipped into the river near Shangduan Fengxiang. The mechanical parts had failed, and the large aircraft tilted into the water before quickly sinking. The pilot, Zhan Daoyu, and passenger Wu Bofan (a Shaanxi representative invited by Li Bai of Guangxi Province to travel from Guangdong to Guilin via chartered plane) drowned. After the accident, local villagers who witnessed the scene reported it to the county government, which immediately informed the provincial authorities and related departments. Southwest China Airlines immediately dispatched technicians to Sanshui, accompanied by an adjutant from the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, to recover the bodies of Wu and Zhan. After discovering traces of aviation fuel on the river's surface, they dragged the wrecked aircraft out of the water and recovered the bodies of Wu and Zhan. On the 24th, a dedicated train on the Guangzhou-Sanshui railway transported the bodies back to Guangzhou. Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Route Army, personally attended the memorial service for Mr. Wu. Wu's body was taken to the Yueguang Company for funeral arrangements. Xiang also sent two adjutants from the headquarters to handle Wu's post-mortem affairs. The body of the pilot, Zhan Daoyu, was also taken to Yueguang Company for funeral arrangements, overseen by Southwest China Airlines. The company telegraphed Zhan's family in Qiongya (Zhan's ancestral home) to come to Guangzhou for the funeral and offered condolences, in accordance with relevant regulations. As for Wu Bofan, a scientific inventor and consultant to the Shaanxi Provincial Government, who was on an official mission from Guangdong-Guangxi province, the authorities greatly valued his presence. Now, having tragically lost his life in service, Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander of the Fourth Route Army, dispatched an adjutant to join a special envoy from the Guangxi authorities in Guangzhou to organize Wu's funeral arrangements. They also telegraphed his family to come to Guangzhou to transport Wu's coffin back to his ancestral home in Hubei for burial. A grand memorial service for Dr. Wu Bofan will be held during the day to honor his memory and talent. Li Zongren of Guangxi Province, recognizing Wu's unfortunate demise as a great loss to the academic community, telegraphed Kan Zonghua, Director of the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters stationed in Guangdong, on the 24th, authorizing 3,000 yuan to cover Wu's funeral expenses and dispatching personnel to assist with the post-mortem affairs. The telegram stated, "(Above omitted) Dr. Wu Bofan tragically lost his life in a plane crash en route to Guangxi. The nation's reconstruction has lost a talented individual, deeply regrettable. Please, Brother Huaizhou (Kan Zonghua), immediately allocate 3,000 yuan for Dr. Wu's funeral expenses and dispatch personnel to assist with all arrangements to comfort his spirit. Regarding condolence matters, please verify his qualifications and consult with Brother Xiang Molin (Hanping), so that Guangdong and Guangxi can jointly petition the central government to show the utmost respect and consideration for the virtuous. Zongren respectfully (24th) stamped." From this, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities' respect for this scholar and consultant to the Shaanxi government is evident. The "Chang Geng" aircraft, salvaged from the river, was transported back to Guangzhou by small boat on the 26th and towed to the Shipai airfield for repairs. It is reported that the damage was not severe, and the aircraft should be able to resume flying after repairs.</p>
<h3>Jia Ding Bandit Den, Little Liangshan, Burned Down</h3>
<p>Little Liangshan is a village in Zhuzhai Township, the second district of the county, with more than 40 households, most of whom are thieves. It is named after Liangshanbo from the Water Margin. The original village name is no longer used. Their thievery is organized, with Xu Aliang as the leader. They use the proceeds to hire Tao as a legal advisor. Nearby people know their activities but are afraid to speak out. They travel in groups at night, and people avoid them for fear of their ferocity. Their history goes back decades. But the local government has never paid attention because it is remote and news doesn't spread. On February 9th, they went to Bo Aliu's house near Panlong, Qingpu, to steal. The bandit Yang Er crawled into the hole. Bo sensed this and prepared a sharp blade. When Yang was halfway out of the hole, Bo stabbed him. Yang cried out. The other bandits broke down the door. Bo fought back but was outnumbered. Yang was seriously wounded in the stomach. The other bandits carried him back, leaving a trail of blood. He died when he arrived home. The bandits secretly buried him to hide their crime. On the 10th, Bo Aliu reported to the Qingpu police, and the Qingpu Huangdu and Xu Jing police squads went together to Little Liangshan to investigate. They arrested eight men and one woman and recovered a lot of stolen goods. They were all sent to the Qingpu county government for interrogation. The woman arrested was Yang Er's wife. She confessed and they recovered Yang's body. The township head reported to the county government, which sent an official to verify the body on the 11th. After the raid, the bandits hid. Many people went to see the bandit den and were outraged to see the stolen goods. They burned 30 tile-roofed houses and damaged 20 more. The Nanxiang police squad came to suppress the crowd and restore order. It is rumored that the bandits are using their money to lobby officials in Nanxiang and Jiwang to resolve the matter. County Chief Guo thought the matter was serious because it involves Qingpu County and Shanghai, and is consulting with the other governments to decide how to handle it.</p>
<h3>The "Hujing" Ferryboat Sinks in Suzhou Lake</h3>
<p>The "Hujing" ferryboat, owned by the Shanghai Zhengchang Shipping Company, departed from Shanghai with dozens of passengers and a large quantity of goods on the afternoon of the 4th, heading directly to Huzhou. At 4 a.m. on the 5th, while still dark, the ferryboat arrived at the Chenwang Township police station on the river under the jurisdiction of Wujiang County. While passing through the Ande Bridge and making a turn, the bottom of the boat struck the bridge stone, causing significant damage. After sailing about 50 or 60 feet from the bridge, the crew realized that the boat was rapidly sinking due to a severe leak in the hull. They quickly steered towards the shore. Passengers scrambled to escape, creating chaos. Simultaneously, the ferryboat gradually sank. After about 20 minutes, the ferryboat was submerged. Fortunately, all the passengers escaped, but most of the cargo could not be salvaged. Afterwards, the head engineer, Zhao Abing, returned to Shanghai to report to the company and arrange for salvage operations.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Death of a County Middle School Student</h3>
<p>Hu Bangduo, an 18-year-old student at the Canglangting Wuxian County Middle School from Hunan Province, complained of fever at 3 p.m. on the 4th during class, and returned to the dormitory to rest. At 9 p.m., he suddenly experienced severe vomiting and diarrhea. The school doctor, Cao Zhongwen, diagnosed acute gastroenteritis and prescribed medication. Unexpectedly, he died at 5 a.m. on the 5th. The school authorities notified the student's father, Hu Tingsheng, who traveled from Dongting East Mountain to the school. Upon seeing his son's corpse with a purplish complexion, and learning about the course of his illness, he confronted the school principal, Cao Deyue, alleging that his son died only ten-odd hours after becoming ill, and the corpse was feverish, implying that the death was caused by incorrect medication. The school doctor claimed the corpse was purple because of the high fever near death caused blood vessel to burst. The two parties are currently in negotiation. The court was notified and went to examine the body at 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Changshu Embezzlement Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>The embezzlement case involving Zhang Changqi, a second-level clerk and land tax commissioner in the county government, has attracted the attention of the local residents. It is reported that the county government, which also handles judicial matters, has dismissed the case and archived it. The embezzled funds of 1,000 yuan have also been returned. Zhang left Changshu three days ago. The people are suspicious of Zhang, as he is a clerk with limited income. How could he have remitted such a large sum of money to his hometown in just a few months? Even if it were his private property, why would he secretly go to Suzhou to remit it? The various organizations have telegraphed County Chief Chen, pointing out that he concurrently handles judicial matters and should recuse himself due to his subordinate's involvement. However, Chen did not take any action. Now, at the conclusion of the county's judicial proceedings, before the court is established, he ordered the presiding officer to make this judgment, which is causing dissatisfaction among the people.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Minfeng Factory Strike in Stalemate</h3>
<p>The strike by female workers at the Minfeng Yarn Factory has been through multiple disturbances, with the destruction of objects in the machine room meeting room and other places. Xu Baoguang, head of the city police station, and Jiang Dingsheng, director of the general labor union preparation, serve as mediators. The female workers put forward seven requests. The factory agreed to study them, and will give a reply on the 4th. The factory was peaceful from the night of the 3rd to the morning of the 4th. On the afternoon of the 4th, the female workers went to the county party headquarters to listen to the news. But they didn't get results. Most of the female workers went back to the factory and caused trouble. Some held up chamber pots and brooms and danced. Some threw bricks at the wall. The factory said that the workers interfering with the students of the training class was a matter of personnel administration, and workers do not have the right to interfere. It insisted on the principle of unconditional resumption of work. Xu Baoguang went to the county government to consult with Secretary Huang Xianzeng, who consulted with the second district commissioner. At 9 PM, Jiang Dingsheng went to the factory to solicit opinions. The female workers seemed to be making concessions. They said that the students in the training class should not interfere with workers' jobs, and some machines should be allocated to the students in the training class. Wages should be increased pending a review by an arbitration committee. Chen Yuchuan and Sun Jinsheng should be transferred to other positions. Jiang Dingsheng consulted with the factory. The factory agreed to consult and reply on the morning of the 5th.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Business Tax Difficult to Cancel</h3>
<p>At the recent conference of the Jiangsu Provincial Businessmen's Federation, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce proposed that, given the Ministry of Finance's implementation of income tax collection, in order to reduce the burden on businesses and residents, the conference should petition for the cancellation of the business tax bureau. However, according to officials from the Department of Finance, the Federation's suggestion was made directly to the Ministry of Finance, and the department had not received any formal document. The department did not want to express any opinion on this matter. Objectively speaking, it is unlikely that this request will be granted. It should be noted that income tax is a national revenue, while business tax is a provincial revenue. In terms of principles, they do not conflict. The business tax has become increasingly standardized in recent years, with tax revenues increasing. The future of business taxation is unlimited. The Business Tax Law was approved by the Legislative Yuan and approved by the Executive Yuan and is a legitimate tax revenue. It cannot be easily changed.</p>

<h3>Today's Group A Soccer: Donghua Faces Laurel Again</h3>
<p>Matches at Shenyuan Stadium at 3:00 PM; Jinan vs. Western Police at Jiaozhou Garden</p>
<p>Today's Western Union soccer schedule includes four Group A matches. The outcomes of the French Business vs. Portuguese, Lax vs. Western Business, and Western Police vs. Jinan matches are relatively predictable. The Donghua vs. Laurel match is of greatest interest. In the first round-robin, Donghua defeated the British Army 4-0. Today, the situation has changed dramatically. Laurel is at its peak, with the god of victory favoring the British Army, which can be foreseen. The roster for tomorrow's International Cup semi-final match will be determined after today's Donghua match, according to manager Yu Hengzhi. About 70% of the Chinese representatives are from Donghua. Therefore, the intense battle today will impact tomorrow's International Cup. Fortunately, yesterday was rainy, and it is uncertain whether today's matches will be played, depending on the weather and field conditions. Hopefully, the postponement will preserve strength for tomorrow's International Cup semi-final. Today's Schedule French Business vs. Portuguese (Group A) Yiyuan, He Chunhui Lax vs. Western Business (Group A) Hongkou, San Laurel vs. Donghua (Group A) Shenyuan, Marshall, Linesmen Zhang Le, Maiqidi Jinan vs. Western Police (Group A) Jiaozhou Garden</p>
<h3>Ten Teams Already Registered for Jiangwan Group Cross-Country Race</h3>
<p>Registration Deadline: 14th</p>
<p>The annual public international Jiangwan group cross-country championship, organized by the Westerners' Athletic Association, will be held on the 21st of this month (Sunday). According to the association's secretary, Wei Dejun, ten teams have already registered, including the Chinese Police Team, the French Army, the British Army, Laurel, and two mixed teams organized by the association, as well as the Hongkou and Yibing teams. The two Chinese teams will register after their selection. As the race date is approaching, the registration deadline is set for the 14th of this month. Those who wish to participate but have not yet registered can contact Wei Dejun at the General Transportation Office of the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road. The association stated that, in accordance with British cross-country race rules, this year will feature teams of ten, with the scores of the first eight finishers counted, doubling the number of counted finishers from the past. Therefore, the number of prizes has also increased. However, the prizes committee believes that prizes should represent honor and should be made of silver, steel, bronze, or antimony to symbolize permanence, rather than the currently popular silver shields and cups. Athletes endure much hardship and expend much sweat and blood during training. If the association were to provide imitation products that would fade with time, it would be equivalent to temporary deception, which is regrettable and contradicts the purpose of promotion. Therefore, the prizes for the top ten finishers this year will be especially rich. In addition to the prizes provided by the association, the Continental Daily, Mr. Littell, Mr. Kangtian De, the American Express Bank, and the Yizhong Tobacco Company have donated many silver cups and shields. There are also no fewer than ten other companies and individuals who have pledged donations but have not yet delivered them. These prizes are planned to be displayed at a certain company within days, and negotiations are still underway. The association's tenth practice session is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM, starting from the west gate of Hongkou Park, with a total distance of six miles. All Chinese and Western teams are expected to arrive on time.</p>

<h3>Promoting Labor Affairs at the Chinese Vocational Education Society</h3>
<p>In Collaboration with Shenxin Textile Mill No. 3, Establishing a Labor Autonomy Experimental Zone</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Vocational Education Society began promoting labor affairs, using the labor autonomy zone of Shenxin Textile Mill No. 3 in Wuxi as an experimental site, progress has been rapid. The latest situation is detailed below for the reference of those concerned with labor education.</p>
<p>Zonal Organization</p>
<p>The entire area is divided into four major zones: the single female workers' zone, the single male workers' zone, the staff and family zone, and the workers' family zone, totaling fifteen villages with 3,130 people. In the future, it is planned to fully develop the workers' family zone and engage in the organization of an "Anle New Village" (Peace and Happiness New Village), to achieve the goal of ruralizing the factory and turning the zone's residents into farmers.</p>
<p>Educational Situation</p>
<p>Currently, there are two levels of nurseries, accommodating 48 children; primary school-level students number 215; and there are 18 literacy classes with 795 students. Twelve classes in rabbit raising, chicken raising, mink raising, photography, sewing, and car driving have graduated 695 students. There are 115 female worker training school students and 12 machine worker training school students. There are 157 primary school teachers of all levels, over 580 books, and two kinds of publications, including "Shenxin News."</p>
<p>Sanitary Facilities</p>
<p>A new Western-style employee hospital building was constructed, costing 4,100 yuan. In addition, X-ray and surgical blood testing equipment were added, valued at over 10,000 yuan. This year, 1,728 employees have been treated by Western medicine and 435 by traditional Chinese medicine (starting in August). There are five bathhouses, able to accommodate 120 people simultaneously.</p>
<p>Employee Life</p>
<p>Usually, great attention is paid to imparting life skills and knowledge to employees, such as promoting rural side occupations and teaching practical skills, to ensure they possess a skill that can be applied. Employee efficiency has greatly improved, and the spirit of happy work is especially rich. In addition, collective organization and entertainment activities are also vigorously promoted. This year, a new auditorium was built, accommodating over 400 people, for residents to use for centralized training, meetings, lectures, and entertainment in their spare time. Radio equipment has been installed. This year, there was one Peking opera performance, two movie screenings, and three theatrical performances. Four tour groups were organized. At the same time, particular attention is paid to instilling and promoting the national spirit. A Zunxian Hall (Hall of Honoring the Virtuous) has been established, with statues of Yue Fei and Qi Jiguang enshrined in the center, for reverence.</p>
<h3>Middle School Graduation Examination Questions (2)</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Looking at the changes to the graduation examination procedures, the number of subjects has been reduced several times, now down to five, about half of what it used to be. Before the graduation examination, schools no longer hold graduation exams, only semester exams. The total score of the school is based on the semester exams. The content of the semester exams only includes the material of the last semester. This is clearly different from graduation exams, which cover all subjects learned in the three years. Although the scope of each graduation examination subject is also the entire three-year curriculum, only subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, and geography have substantial content. Chinese and foreign languages are symbolic subjects, relying on gradual cultivation rather than rote memorization. If school graduation exams were held instead of graduation examinations, junior high school would require exams in civics, manual labor, music, and other subjects covering the entire curriculum. Subjects such as physiology, hygiene, botany, and zoology, whose courses ended earlier, would require re-examination of the entire curriculum. Senior high school would require exams in physical education, music, and other subjects covering the entire curriculum. Subjects such as civics, ethics, and biology, whose courses ended earlier, would require re-examination of the entire curriculum. Furthermore, the graduation examination procedures combine physics and chemistry, and history and geography, into single subjects, which differs significantly in weight and difficulty from the graduation exams where each subject is a separate unit. Therefore, the burden on students from internal graduation examinations, where some subjects only require examination of the last semester's coursework, some are exempt from exams having ended earlier, and some combine two subjects into one unit, is much lighter than that of school graduation exams. Regarding the acceptance of students who fail one or two subjects in the graduation examination, the remedies for those who still fail after supplementary exams, and the calculation of graduation scores, all have been repeatedly improved. It is also estimated that there are many drawbacks in using the graduation examination to estimate school performance. The most prominent is that poorly managed schools neglect discipline and instruction, resulting in a large number of students held back temporarily to reduce the percentage of failing students and the ratio of participants in the graduation examination, which greatly harms young people. The changed procedures have already deleted this.</p>
<p>If the graduation examination is merely harmless, there would be no point in taking this extra step. However, we seek to make it beneficial. What is the benefit? To standardize the graduation level of middle school students and increase teaching efficiency. Although the middle school curriculum standards were promulgated after 1929, schools still use different textbooks. Since the graduation examination is implemented, questions must be based on the standard scope, so schools have no choice but to strictly follow the standards and use approved textbooks. The situation of using a variety of standards has changed greatly. As for the teaching situation of each subject reflected in the results of the graduation examination, the best subjects in senior high school in 1932 were Chinese language and party principles, and in junior high school were party principles, Chinese language, and geography. In 1933, the best subjects in senior high school were geography, party principles, and Chinese language, and in junior high school were party principles and history and geography. In 1934, the best subjects in senior high school were party principles, Chinese language, history, and geography, and in junior high school were party principles, Chinese language, physical science, chemistry, history, and geography. The worst subjects in senior high school in 1932 were mathematics and foreign languages, and in junior high school were mathematics, natural science, and foreign languages. In 1933, the worst subjects in senior high school were mathematics, foreign languages, and physics, and in junior high school were foreign languages, mathematics, and Chinese language. In 1934, the worst subjects in senior high school were mathematics and foreign languages, and in junior high school were foreign languages, physical science, chemistry, and mathematics. Generally speaking over three years, the better subjects for both senior and junior high school were party principles and Chinese, with history and geography next, and the worst subjects were foreign languages, mathematics, physical science, chemistry, and natural science. In view of these major defects, three things have been done to seek remedies. First, the curriculum standards have been revised. Senior high school mathematics has been divided into groups for teaching from the second year. Group A has more time than before, and the curriculum content remains unchanged. Group B has less time, and the content and level are also reduced, so that students can choose to study according to their personality and obtain a solid understanding. Second, teacher training is being vigorously promoted. Summer training courses have been held for three consecutive years, with special emphasis on mathematics and science. The training and selection methods are becoming more strict. Third, scientific instruments are being manufactured. Since 1935, the Ministry of Education, jointly with the Board of Trustees for the British Boxer Indemnity Fund and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, has allocated funds and entrusted the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica to manufacture domestic scientific instruments according to the standards for physics and chemistry equipment for senior and junior high schools promulgated by the Ministry, and to sell them to middle schools across the country at reduced prices. This year, this plan will be expanded in scope and continued. In the future, all schools must have this standard equipment to increase the efficiency of science teaching. All of these are matters that should be done to improve middle school education, but with the reference of the results of the graduation examination, the order of priority becomes clearer. In short, although it is not easy to see the effect of standardizing the graduation level of middle school students and improving teaching efficiency through the graduation examination, it is a clear fact that teachers and students in schools have been working hard on their studies, eliminating the past abuses of perfunctory and superficial work. Following this trend, it can be said that the knowledge education of middle school students will gradually become more solid, and the level of graduation will gradually become more standardized. The fact that young people's actions tend to be more regular and the academic atmosphere is becoming more serious because of their efforts in their studies is a side effect of the graduation examination system, and not its main goal. Some say that "the graduation examination system is to urge students to study books, increase their workload, and shift their attention away from the country and society, thereby eliminating student unrest," which is a biased view and a misunderstanding. Even in terms of eliminating student unrest, it is a reverse inference.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Regularly Holds Academic Lectures</h3>
<p>Jointly Organized with the Chinese Academy of Arts and Sciences</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Prices Relatively Firm Recently</h3>
<p>Distant Futures May Be at Their Limit, Spot Transactions Show Potential for Development</p>
<p>After a large increase in the yarn market the previous day, there was a slight reaction yesterday. Yesterday's decline saw a varied trend, as American cotton and first-grade yarn both fell back slightly, but the degree of decline was minimal. However, in general, the shorts, seeing that yarn mills are operating at full capacity, are extremely keen to short. Therefore, although Indian merchants are holding firm and prices are relatively firm, distant futures are being sold off heavily, so competition between the longs and shorts is fierce, and the future will depend on actual demand.</p>

However, the pullback in the yarn market has slightly affected the market situation, but spot cotton mills are becoming more willing to enter, and Japanese mills are purchasing more vigorously.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Lacks Excitement</p>
<p>The opening of the tag cotton market saw a flat market sentiment due to mixed涨跌 in American cotton, Indian cotton still rising by 2 to 4 rupees, and Osaka three-grade cotton falling by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan.各月涨跌 five points.

<p>Spot cotton consumption is still maintained, and mill appetite is gradually developing. The source is 1,300 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>Various Yarn Mills Purchased Less Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>—Statistics for February—</p>
<p>In February, Shanghai Chinese and foreign mills purchased a total of 71,598 bales of raw cotton, a decrease of 7,642 bales compared to January. Among them, Chinese mills purchased 46,229 bales, a decrease of 1,680 bales compared to January, and Japanese mills purchased 15,369 bales, a decrease of 5,954 bales compared to January. The reason for the decrease is due to the Lunar New Year holiday and the temporary shutdown during the Spring Festival, which made the market quiet for a while, and the yarn mills' buying interest declined accordingly. On the one hand, factories had purchased quite a bit before the Lunar New Year, so they are now taking a wait-and-see approach.

<h3>Compilation Method for Income Tax Return Forms (3)</h3>
<p>(1) Business Report Form (Continued)</p>
<p>— Pan Shih-hao</p>
<p>Branch stores established by a partnership, with capital allocated from the head office, can also fill in the position of operating capital. Or, when the head office files this form, intending to separately report the income of the branches, the remaining amount after deducting the allocated capital to the branches from the actual amount of the share capital should be filled in the operating capital position. If the branch stores are filing this form and have no allocated capital, they can indicate "Capital at the Head Office" in the operating capital position. The operating capital or actual amount of share capital filled in this form should be the same as the capital or share capital recorded in the transcription book and reported when registering the business. If a partnership has a written agreement, the records of capital or share capital in the books should also be consistent with the agreement. Accumulated surplus and profits that have not been formally transferred to capital or share capital should not be included. If it is necessary to report the accumulated surplus, it can be filled in the remarks section. In fact, according to the current laws on income tax, if accumulated surplus is not converted into capital or share capital, one-third of it cannot be added to the capital calculation as a basis for calculating the income tax rate. Article 5 of the Draft Notice on the Collection of Income Tax for Category 1 Profit-Seeking Enterprises stipulates that the one-third addition of accumulated surplus to capital calculation is limited to the accumulated surplus stipulated by laws and regulations. The so-called accumulated surplus stipulated by laws and regulations is actually the accumulated surplus stipulated for limited companies in Article 170 of the Company Law. Accumulated surplus withdrawn by individual proprietorships or partnerships is not the accumulated surplus stipulated by laws and regulations. The main reason why businesses cannot file the business report form on time is the inability to determine the capital amount. According to the current income tax laws, the income tax for profit-seeking enterprises is calculated by first figuring out what percentage of the actual capital amount the income is, and then using progressive tax rates to calculate the tax payable. The larger the capital of the same profit-making business, the smaller the tax rate. This concept has been deeply ingrained in most businesses. However, most of China's bookkeeping methods have not been improved. The calculation of the actual capital amount is simplified, lacking comprehensiveness. Some businesses initially invested several thousand yuan in capital, but now their net assets reach several hundred thousand yuan, while the capital amount on the books is still recorded as several thousand yuan. Others have large-scale operations and complex asset structures, but have no capital recorded on the books. As a result, it takes a long time to organize and verify, and the business report is delayed. In reality, the matters declared in this form can be changed in the future. If there is already a record of capital in the books, or the capital amount has already been partially agreed upon by shareholders, regardless of the written amount, it can be filed first. When a complete verification is calculated in the future, another change can be filed. It is also permissible if the declared amount temporarily does not match the business registration and partnership agreement. The business registration can be changed. The partnership agreement can be revised or a new share receipt can be created. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The New Tasks of Women Today</h3>
<p>— Jin Sheng</p>
<p>The cries for "women's liberation" and "gender equality" are rising day by day during this extraordinary period. On the surface, this is undoubtedly a sign of progress. However, upon closer observation, we feel greatly disappointed! Because some women today, on the one hand, are shouting for "gender equality," while on the other hand, they willingly "become playthings for men." On the one hand, they are shouting for "women's liberation," while on the other hand, they are adding "limitless constraints" to themselves. Know that women seeking "true liberation" and "true equality" cannot achieve results by empty talk but by practical action. The essentials of how to take practical action are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  The Beauty of Knowledge: Knowledge is the foundation of life. A person without knowledge is like a soulless shell, lacking thought. They rely on others in everything and can hardly get rid of this bad habit no matter the time or place. If the object of reliance disappears or dies, they will likely wander around and feel pain everywhere. Therefore, to seek liberation, one must not have a dependent mind. To avoid dependence, one must first have an independent spirit and sufficient intelligence. Thus, we must strive for our studies, enrich our knowledge, and especially during this extraordinary period, we must strive for daily progress and beautify our knowledge to become women of the times.</p>
<p>2.  The Beauty of Health: To have sound knowledge, one must first have a healthy body. To have a healthy body, one must have proper exercise. With a healthy body, one can endure hardship. With the ability to endure hardship, one has the power to work. With the power to work, one need not worry about "gender inequality" or "women's liberation."</p>
<p>3.  The Beauty of Morality: Having a healthy physique and full knowledge, but lacking beautiful morality, the spirit and knowledge can instead help them to do evil. For example, seeing others wearing gorgeous clothes and living comfortably, a woman without morality will feel envious. Once tempted, she will easily fall. How can such a woman lacking morality talk about true equality? Therefore, every woman must respect her own morality and recognize her own responsibilities. If she achieves this, her heart will be calm and without regrets. In this way, she will obtain true equality without seeking it, and even men who play with women will respect her!</p>
<p>The love of beauty is inherent in everyone, especially women. The beauty we need is like hunger seeking food and thirst seeking drink. However, the beauty we need is not superficial but internal. Superficial beauty is temporary, while internal beauty is permanent. Who doesn't love a beautiful face, but faces age quickly? Who doesn't love a beautiful voice, but voices change soon? These are all superficial beauties that cannot last.</p>
<p>Women, if we can achieve the above three points, why worry that others will not give us due sympathy?</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Clara Zetkin, Founder of International Women's Day (1857-1933)</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>— Written before "March 8th" —</p>
<p>International Women's Day is a memorial day for women to fight for independent personalities from the shackles of the old feudal ethics. It is also the most glorious page for women to seek liberation. Therefore, every year on "March 8th," women in countries around the world hold enthusiastic commemorative meetings. This is such a happy festival for us! Sisters who have already been liberated are naturally very joyful. Everyone dances, sings, talks, and says. But looking back at Chinese women, because of the poisoning of feudal society, there are still many sisters who are living "inhuman lives." What a heartbreaking thing! I hope everyone will follow in the bloodstained footsteps of the past struggles and work hard! Work hard to move forward! Only then will we be worthy of Ms. Clara Zetkin, who leads us. Now, I might as well introduce her brief biography to you.</p>
<p>Ms. Clara Zetkin was born in 1857 in Niederrad, Germany. Her father was a primary school teacher. The family style was simple, and she lived in pure nature. At the age of twenty, she left home and entered the Leipzig Normal School. At that time, Germany was gradually developing its national strength, and capitalism was gradually maturing. The conflict between labor and capital was also gradually growing. At this time, Ms. Clara met many exiles from Russia and Poland and joined the Social Democratic Party. Soon, she met the Russian exiled revolutionary Osip Zetkin. In 1878, the German government promulgated the "Anti-Socialist Law." Anyone suspected of believing in socialism was arrested, and Osip Zetkin was also deported. Therefore, Ms. Clara followed Osip and left her motherland of Germany. In 1880, the two lived together in Switzerland. Soon, they went to Paris, France. Later, Osip suffered from an incurable serious illness. For the sake of her sick husband and two children, she had to teach, translate, or write to maintain their lives. Thus, she tasted the pain of being displaced in a foreign land and also suffered the material pain of revolutionaries. This pain may have led her to fight for the oppressed.</p>
<p>In 1889, Osip passed away. At that time, the German "Anti-Socialist Law" had been abolished. Clara took her children and returned to her homeland. Soon, she joined the Social Democratic Party of Stuttgart. In 1892, she edited the "Equality Women's Magazine" and devoted herself to the women's liberation movement, seeking benefits for working women. Her remarks received sympathy and support from many people. She supported this editor's position for as long as thirteen years. She clarified the differences between the bourgeois women's movement and the working-class women's movement. Moreover, she organized many women's groups and engaged in the women's public. The real famous "Bain Declaration" opposed the most cruel war for the benefit of a few people. Therefore, she ate several months of lawsuits, but this punishment strengthened her will to oppose. In July of the same year, she founded the "International Magazine." In 1907, at her suggestion, an international women's socialist secretariat was established at the International Socialist Women's Congress, and she was appointed as secretary. The International Women's Association was established on March 8, 1907, and it was decided that this day would be "International Women's Day." This is the origin of the "March 8th" Festival. Perhaps you don't know it!</p>
<p>In 1917, the Russian Revolution broke out. She worked hard to promote the Russian Revolution. At that time, she had been elected as the first member of the German parliament. When she first took the stage to speak, she boldly expressed her support for the Soviet Union. Her eloquent and great remarks shook the entire audience. In 1920, she stepped into the Soviet Union she had been looking forward to. At this time, the Soviet Union was holding the Ninth Congress. When she walked into the "Sverdlov" Hall of the Kremlin Palace, there was a thunderous applause, and the crowd warmly welcomed her. In 1933, at the International Anti-War Conference held in Amsterdam, she used various means from all aspects to oppose the necessity of World War II. "Opposing war is opposing the aggressors of imperialism." This was her only slogan. In the same year, she returned to Germany once and used her highly respected qualifications to deliver a closing speech in the German Parliament. Later, she went to Moscow, the capital of Russia, and soon fell asleep there, at the age of seventy-six. Hundreds of thousands of people attended the funeral. People like Stalin and Molotov, important figures in Russia, personally helped with the coffin and buried the learned and talented world female revolutionary after Lenin's tomb. It was truly the ultimate posthumous glory.</p>
<p>From the above brief biography, we can see that she is the savior of women all over the world. Now that she is dead, but we have sought liberation from shackles and obtained an equal status. She is indeed our only leader. Therefore, we should continue to fight to rescue many pitiful female compatriots from the "inhuman life" of deep water and fire, so that she can also get some comfort! Her lifetime works include "Luxembourg and the Russian Revolution," "Women's Labor in Modern Women's Issues," "Women's Suffrage Issues," "The Origin of the Proletarian Women's Movement," and "Remembering Lenin." Dear female compatriots! The day after tomorrow is the "March 8th" anniversary. Please don't forget Ms. Clara Zetkin, who has worked hard!</p>
<h3>When the Plum Blossoms Bloom</h3>
<p>— You Lan</p>
<p>Spring has come, and the first happy thing is the blooming of those plum blossoms with their subtle fragrance and sparse shadows. Xu Chu once said very triumphantly: "After I die, I would like to be buried under any plum tree." This also shows how deep his love for plum blossoms is.</p>
<p>During a season when plum blossoms were in full bloom, I arranged with Xu Chu to go to Guangfu, Suzhou for a two or three-day vacation. We originally said that the two of us would go, but when I arrived at the station, I saw that Xu Chu had brought a woman with him. Although this situation was abrupt, in this era, it was of course unnecessary for me to be surprised. So the three of us got on the train together. After returning to our seats, Xu Chu couldn't help but introduce her to me: "This is Ms. Xu Xinying. You often watch Chinese movies, so I think you've heard her name before, right?" Ah! No wonder she looks so familiar, she's a rising star in the film industry.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu's true appearance is actually even more beautiful than on the screen. Unfortunately, I am the worst at describing a woman's appearance. I only know who is ugly and who is beautiful, but I can't describe it at all. Of course! Ms. Xu belongs to the beautiful category, and is always among the best in the beautiful category. As for how Xu Chu got to know her, and even managed to invite her to be a travel companion, not only did I not know at the time, but I'm still very vague about it even now!</p>
<p>But the scene of the two of them that day really made me feel excited. Xu Chu was so enthusiastically entangled with her, and she was also as tender as water, relying on Xu Chu. I once secretly spied on them kissing six or seven times in the plum grove, and one time the time was about five minutes or more. When we came back, Xu Chu's clothes were still inserted with that small branch of green plum that Ms. Xu had picked for him, and he cherished it as much as the Jiahe Medal and Caiyu Medal.</p>
<p>After that, we didn't see each other for a long time. No, we did see each other, but we were all in a hurry and didn't have a chance to say a few words, which was almost the same as not seeing each other. In this way, two years passed without realizing it, and in a blink of an eye, it was the plum blossom season again. I suddenly had the urge to travel and wanted to go to Chao Mountain for a walk. Because I knew that Xu Chu had the deepest love for plum blossoms, I called him a few days in advance to invite him. Unexpectedly, he was not in the office. When I asked about his home again, they said that he had also moved away. Of course, I was very surprised. I hurried to inquire carefully and found out that he had been splashed with lime bags because of his love affair with Ms. Xu, and both of his eyes were blinded. The matter could not be handled anymore, so he had to return to his hometown in frustration. And Ms. Xu? Who can force her to return to her hometown with Xu Chu!</p>
<p>This news completely broke my interest in exploring plum blossoms.</p>
<h3>Sixth Letter</h3>
<p>— (Zhuo Dai)</p>
<p>Ms. B:</p>
<p>The question you asked in your letter: "Why have gardens in Shanghai been built by the Japanese in recent years?" This is a question worth studying.</p>
<p>Now, the styles of Jin Diqiu Garden can be roughly divided into three schools: the European and American countries, which become one school, China, which also forms its own school, and Japan, which is another school. For the convenience of the architects, the first school of European and American style gardens is called the Formal style, also called the Geometric style, and also called the Pattern style. Because not only the layout of their gardens is square, but even a tree is often cut into a square shape. The Japanese style is exactly the opposite, called the Natural style, and everything imitates nature. Our Chinese gardens are called Pictorial style, which is neither like the Formal style, creating any pattern on an open space, nor does it absolutely imitate nature. It is completely like Chinese painting. If the three are all compared to painting, then the European and American style is instrumental painting, the Japanese style is sketching, and the Chinese style is Chinese painting. However, like sketching, it is not completely sketching.</p>
<p>Chinese gardens have many buildings made of wood, such as towers, pavilions, and terraces, which are often arranged densely, and there are not many open-air places. This is completely contrary to the purpose of modern gardening. The European and American and Japanese styles have very few buildings, most of which are outdoors, which meets modern needs a lot. Moreover, the more buildings there are, the more expensive it becomes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese people build gardens in recent years. First, because of the trend of the times, they do not like to be confined indoors. Second, because of economic reasons, they do not plan to have towers, pavilions, and terraces. Third, they are a little tired of the old-fashioned gardens, so they have to change a direction and adopt some foreign interests. The first thing that Chinese people came into contact with was of course the European and American style gardens in Shanghai and other places; however, this patterned thing is suitable for parks. If private gardens also imitate this style, not only does the area need to be very large, but it cannot arouse the interest of the Chinese people. It is inevitable to feel monotonous.</p>
<p>It is better to have a Japanese-style garden, which is easy to look at. On the one hand, there are more elements of oriental interest, and on the other hand, even if the location is extremely small, it can be arranged well. Third, the materials and labor are very cheap. (Although some are also very expensive, it is possible to find a way to make it cheaper.) Because of various reasons, many private gardens in Shanghai are built by the Japanese. I have also visited four or five places in Shanghai. The garden of Mr. Cheng Linsheng on Xujiahui Road (it seems to be called Suiwulu?) is also completely in Japanese style. Although the area is not large, it is very tortuous. Unfortunately, it has not been repaired recently, and the trees have also withered because a factory in the beach dumped hydrochloric acid.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese who arrange gardens for people in Shanghai are not really garden experts, but just some flower and tree craftsmen who also serve in this position. It is rare to have one or two garden designers among them. This garden designer is almost like a house-building foreman. He can contract the construction; but sometimes he often boldly designs for people, but these people's designs are always inevitably a bit tacky, and there will be unreasonable places. For example, it is too bad to decorate a purely Japanese-style stone lantern in a Chinese garden; if you want him to think of something to replace it, he does not have this ability. Madam! Next time, I will talk to you about the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the three styles. Goodbye.</p>

Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided, Ye Zhizhong recorded, and after the ceremony, the chairman gave the opening remarks, followed by reports from the standing committee member Ke Ganchen and secretary Yan Ese of the Chamber. Next, Liang Hejun, director of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, delivered a speech. Finally, Huang Yisheng, Tang Wenji, and Yan Ese answered over 50 questions raised by the representatives. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai said in his address: "Representatives, the purpose of convening this meeting today is to explain the meaning of declaring capital for income tax purposes. Originally, the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the declaration period should be the end of January. However, as various businesses had not yet completed their annual financial closing at that time, the Chamber negotiated an extension to the end of February. However, the end of February is only half a month away from the financial closing. Given the large number of merchants in Shanghai, many had not yet received the declaration forms during this period, and some businesses did not understand the meaning of declaring capital and were unable to complete the process in time. Therefore, when the deadline arrived at the end of the month, many businesses had not yet reported. In fact, it was necessary to continue the extension. The Chamber believes that declaring capital is the first step in handling income tax and is also the most complicated. Since this first step is not clear, the Chamber believes it is necessary to provide an explanation. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance also shared this sentiment, and therefore scheduled today's meeting. The points that should be explained are as follows: ⑴ The necessity of declaring capital or share capital: Profit income tax is levied on capital of 2,000 yuan or more. Therefore, if the capital is less than this amount, those who are exempt from income tax according to the regulations should report it, otherwise there will be no basis for exemption in the future. Those with capital of more than 1,000 yuan will need to use this to calculate the ratio of profit to capital to determine the tax bracket. If it is not listed and reported, there will be no way to classify it in the future. Therefore, this is the first step in handling income tax. ⑵ The amount of capital declared in form A is different from the amount of income declared: Businesses have two misunderstandings about this: ⑴ They believe that the business year is from the end of May each year to the end of June of the following year. ⑵ They say that the business has peak months and off-peak months, and the current value is an off-peak month, which is no different from a business shutdown. Therefore, based on the above two reasons, they requested another extension. In fact, although the business is suspended, the capital is fixed. The business outlook is the key to calculating the business income. Declaring capital only needs to be based on the current capital, without considering the profits and losses after the end of the year. In short, "business boom and bust" and "the business year has not yet ended" all relate to the scope of declaring income. We are not talking about this now. The declaration of income must be made within three months after the end of the Dingchou year, according to Article 8 of the regulations. Now we only report capital, and we don’t need to discuss this together. ⑶ Capital is different from assets: In addition, many businesses say that it is impossible to complete the inventory of goods and estimate the property in a short time and request an extension, which all fall within the scope of assets. In the future, when declaring income, it may be necessary to submit a balance sheet for verification. Now we only report capital, and we do not need to check the property and inventory. ⑷ Moreover, some businesses say that they are old stores for many years, and the capital cannot be determined. This is not entirely true. If the industrial and commercial enterprise is a company organization, the amount of share capital must be stated in the articles of association and share book or its registration license. If there has been no capital increase or decrease from the beginning, it shall be reported according to the share capital at the beginning. If the share capital has subsequently increased or decreased, it shall be reported according to the actual amount after the increase or decrease of the share capital. If it is a partnership organization, it must also be stated on the agreement and the ten thousand gold book. If it is a sole proprietorship, the amount of capital invested when it was opened must also be stated in the account book, so that there is no way to verify it. In addition, there is a sole proprietorship that has not invested capital by itself, but is overdrafting from the bank at any time for turnover. It should be reported according to the actual amount of capital borrowed, based on the average of the maximum amount and the minimum amount. ⑸ Some say that the entire reserve fund is included in the calculation of capital, and it cannot be determined, so it can only be temporarily postponed. This can be explained in two levels: (1) Capital increase is the freedom of the merchant, and the law does not interfere. If the business is anxious to solve this problem, it can use the capital increase procedure to convert the reserve into capital. At this time, it is not impossible to include it in the table first. (2) If one party is included in the capital calculation, and the other party still wants to retain the name of the reserve fund, you can do the supplementary reporting procedure separately. The above sections are a brief explanation of what I have seen. Today, there are representatives from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance present. If you have any questions, you can ask them face to face for instructions."</p>
<p>Ke Yan's Report</p>
<p>Next, Ke Ganchen, a standing committee member of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, reported, "Income tax is a complicated tax system. In this initial stage, we taxpayers all feel the pain of being at a loss. However, this new tax system is a good tax for self-reliance and national revival. Our people should of course do their best to support and promote it. As a Shanghai merchant group, the Chamber should lead the city's merchants to fulfill the obligation of implementing this good tax. Therefore, not long ago, a series of income tax lectures and research conferences were held. Later, we invited famous scholars and experts in the city to form a special committee, which held more than ten meetings before and after, and thoroughly studied the various collection guidelines and implementation rules, contributed opinions, and requested the tax authorities to adopt them separately to modify the legal terms that were not suitable for business conditions, so as to promote the implementation without obstacles and not to be harsh. We also added income tax training courses and improved Chinese bookkeeping classes to the commercial supplementary school and the Nanshi commercial vocational school affiliated to the Chamber, so that merchants can study. The meaning of convening this meeting today has already been reported by Chairman Wang. It is to make everyone understand how to declare capital, etc. Today, Director Liang of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax has personally attended. We take this opportunity to ask him about any unclear aspects of the tax payment procedures and ask him to answer everything." Then, Secretary Yan Ese reported that item 4 of the declaration of business capital form refers to sole proprietorships, and item 5, "Amount of Paid-in Shares," refers to partnerships. In addition, the interest income from business deposits can also be subject to a handling fee of 10/1000 according to the established practice of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Liang's Speech</p>
<p>Liang Hejun, director of the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, said, "Levying income tax is a necessary and effective financial policy during the national crisis. Our country is seeking national revival and self-reliance, which is imminent. Therefore, today's income tax can be said to be a requirement of the people rather than a government initiative. Former consultant Gamal once said, 'China does not yet have a registered statistics of population and property, and cannot immediately implement income tax.' Recently, Li Ziluosi also said, 'If China wants to implement income tax, it should be handled by foreigners like the customs and post office.' Foreigners often have such views. However, our government has resolutely implemented it. In just a few months, it has achieved results. This is based on the patriotism and self-consciousness of the people. Although social institutions and economic conditions are still incomplete, we believe that after detours and struggles, we will eventually reach the realm of the road. At present, there are 17 units in the country handling income tax. The number of personnel in each unit ranges from a dozen to fifty or sixty, depending on the complexity of local commerce. Most of them are experts or college students who have been tested and trained. It is by no means like the situation of ordinary agencies. At present, a foreign reporter is writing in a certain evening newspaper, criticizing that the tax agency uses too few people, which is quite laughable. Although there are only more than 30 people in the Shanghai Office, the tax collection is handled by the Central Bank and 30 post offices in the city. The audit is handled by all the accounting experts of the future Central Trust Bureau. The investigation is handled by the entire Social Bureau Credit Investigation Office in the city. There are more than 115,000 units for withholding. Therefore, in Shanghai alone, the number of people mobilized for income tax has reached more than 100,000. What the reporter said about relying on only a few people to do things is ridiculous. Foreigners use special rights and maliciously propaganda, which is abominable. However, we are now burying our heads in hard work and self-reliance. We will do it first and say it later. Facts speak louder than words, so we disdain to argue with these irresponsible reporters and say idle words. The tax payment situation has been very enthusiastic recently. Not to mention the Chinese, even the Chinese employees in foreign firms, such as Wah Hai, Ke Pei, Medi, Fu Kang, Ji Bei, Yi Hua, Yu Xing, Lian Na, Bu Nei Men, and other foreign firms, and the Allied Life Insurance Company, An Bao Insurance Company, and Daley Accounting Firm, and other companies have voluntarily reported to the office in no less than 20 cases. It can be seen that our original intention of self-reliance has won a lot of sympathy. If we continue to work hard, we will naturally be greatly successful. In short, income tax must be fair and universal. However, to achieve fairness and universality, foreigners must pay taxes to be meaningful, and the people who handle it will be considered to have fulfilled their responsibilities. However, to make foreigners pay taxes, the people of our country must first actively contribute to be considered self-reliant. In the past month, the merchants and people of the country have unanimously supported this new tax system of self-reliance, which has been proven. In the future, we must hope that everyone will unite and urge the government to be able to handle fair income tax, universal income tax, and more meaningful income tax. This is not only the responsibility that the people in the government dare not forget, but also what everyone should work together to achieve. Today, those who are present are all cadres of various industry groups. I hope to base this idea on guiding the colleagues. If there are still those who are not enthusiastic, we should give them a practical explanation. The most important things to do at present are: ⑴ Declare Capital: The declared capital amount can be obtained from the Chamber of Commerce or the respective trade association, or from this office to obtain the prescribed reporting form. If it is a sole proprietorship, fill in the amount of capital in column 4 of the form. If it is a partnership, fill in the total amount of paid-in capital in column 5 of the form. If the partnership organization has been approved and registered by the Ministry of Industry, fill in the company reporting form prescribed by this office item by item. Do not be afraid of reporting capital, everyone, that you will be subject to any restrictions in the future. If there are any changes in the future (for example, adding the reserve fund to the capital, etc.), or the filling is incorrect, you can correct it, and there is no restriction. ⑵ Declare Deposits: A report form for commercial firms and deposit reports has also been established. Speaking of ordinary commercial firms, many actually have deposits. The government only cracked down on the publicly solicited and savings parts in the past. Other parts are not on the list of cracked down, don't suspect. We should quickly collect the forms and fill them out. ⑶ Withhold Salaries and Remuneration: The Chamber of Commerce should withhold the income tax on the salaries and remuneration of employees for January of this year. The reporting and payment period has arrived. In recent days, tens of thousands of reporting and payment units have arrived. This office has also sent letters to various trade associations to forward the notification letters, urging the commercial firms in attendance, and published an announcement in the newspaper. I hope that everyone will inform their colleagues to report and pay as soon as possible to avoid exceeding the limit. If the tax payable is less than 5 yuan, if everyone finds it troublesome and is willing to consolidate the payment, the person in charge only needs to report to this office, and he will be allowed to consolidate the payment once every three months. ⑷ Withhold Interest on Deposits: The reporting and payment of the income tax on interest on deposits for January of this year has arrived.</p>
<p>Those who have reported have reached millions. When each household is issued interest, it should be withheld at the tax rate prescribed in Article 6 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, which is 50/1000. The handling fee item is of course handled in the same way as the banking industry. For the above three or four items, if there is no withholding tax in that month, the notification letter issued by this office can be attached to the reply letter and mailed to this office for verification, or if the reporting and payment procedures and filling methods are unclear, you can inquire at the "Inquiry Office" of this office, and the person in charge can give instructions one by one. I hope that you can do the above points, and in terms of procedures, this office will do its best to simplify it. For example, salaries and remuneration were originally scheduled to be withheld monthly. Later, some people said that if they were withheld monthly, the amount below 5 yuan was too small, and the round-trip fare and time were not economical. This office has changed it and allowed it to be reported in aggregate. For example, salaries and remuneration were originally required to be withheld monthly, but now a specific advance reporting method is also available. Each business can estimate the number of employees and salaries for the year and withhold them once. If there are any changes at the end of the year, supplementary reports are still allowed. These are all specially accommodated in the middle of the law. In the future, if the business community still feels inconvenient, this office should try its best to come up with ideas within the scope of what is possible in terms of reason and sentiment. If this office does not have the power in time, it will also ask the Ministry of Finance on its behalf, because I have served in the financial industry and have been the president of the High Court and the director of the Finance Department. I know that the government's tax collection, no matter how perfect the principles are, as long as there is a slight inconvenience in the procedure, it will make the taxpayers feel that money and time are wasted. This is what makes taxpayers feel the pain of being difficult and troublesome. Therefore, this time I was ordered to handle income tax, and I have made up my mind to seek convenience for the merchants and people. Don't treat me as a tax official, but treat me as a member of the public service. I should always be urged or reprimanded. The officials of the past did not make the people love them, but only made the people fear them. Now, the reason for handling income tax is to revive the nation and be self-reliant. The government and the people should be united and stand on the same line to fight to the end. A certain foreigner once said that the Chinese were loose sand, but recently he changed his tone and said that the Chinese have become as strong as cement. Are we like cement or loose sand? This should be a unanimous reflection and effort. Finally, I have one more sentence to report to you incidentally: Income tax is originally a lottery tax. If you want the tax to be prosperous, you must make the merchants and people rich. Now the central government is paying great attention to the development of the national economy. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session also has an exact expression. Minister Kong has the determination to develop the national economy by using the power of the government, the financial resources of the government, or the convenient methods prescribed by the government. On the one hand, everyone should put forward various plans based on their own business to tell the government and subsidize the progress. If everyone is living a good life, our income tax can of course benefit from it. This is an even deeper meaning in the voice of self-reliance." After Liang's speech, Huang Yisheng, secretary of the office, Tang Wenkai, and Yan Ese, secretary of the City Chamber of Commerce, answered questions and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Zhang Fang Hosted Guests from All Walks of Life Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report on the Drought Situation in Henan Province, Establishment of Relief Committee from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Central Committee Member Zhang Fang called for relief to the drought in Henan Province. He specially hosted guests from all walks of life in the city at the 8th floor of the Hua'an Apartments at 4:00 PM yesterday to report on the disaster situation. The Shanghai Relief Committee for the Henan Drought was organized, and Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was appointed Honorary President, and Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, was appointed President. It was established today. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Hosting Guests from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The leaders from all walks of life who attended included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Director Pan Gongzhan, Local Association President Du Yuesheng, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, as well as Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Shouyong, Yu Zuoting, Jiang Yiping, Li Dachao, Chen Hang, Song Hanzhang, Wu Yun Chu, Hu Bijang, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Yiting, Tang Shoumin, Qian Jingping, Guo Wufang, Shen Na, and more than 100 others. They were received by Zhang Fang and Lu Dangping, Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<p>Zhang Fang's Report</p>
<p>Zhang Fang gave a report on the drought situation in Henan Province on the spot, stating that Henan Province was unfortunate and suffered frequent disasters. There was a severe drought last year, and it did not rain for years. The autumn crops yielded nothing, and the second wheat was mostly not sown. The wheat harvest is hopeless this year. Even if there is rain in the future, it will not be possible to obtain food until after the autumn. Ninety-three counties in the province were affected, the most seriously affected were 27 counties including Dengfeng, the next most seriously affected were 34 counties including Runan, and the next most seriously affected were 32 counties including Xuchang. The disaster area accounted for nine-tenths of the province, and there were more than 9 million victims, at least half of whom could not survive without accounts. A few months ago, the stems of sweet potatoes, cotton leaves, elm bark, locust beans, etc. were all eaten. Some even used wheat straw and stone powder to fill their hunger. Some sold their wives and children for food. Those who were displaced and fled to all directions numbered more than a thousand. At the Minquan County Railway Station, more than 2,000 victims were competing to board the train, and there were clashes with the security team, resulting in four deaths and dozens of injuries. There were also thousands of victims at Guanyintang and other places in Luoyang, demanding to take the train. Famine victims from other counties came to the province to eat, and the roads were blocked. The southeast gates of the provincial capital were closed for many days. Recently, incidents of organized grain robbery have occurred in Fugou, Xihua, and other counties. Those who are weak and unable to find food either hang themselves in their homes or commit suicide by cutting their stomachs. All kinds of tragic situations cannot be described. Previously, the central government issued 300,000 yuan in public bonds, which was equivalent to more than 180,000 yuan in national currency, which was distributed for urgent relief. It was a drop in the bucket, and very few were fully alive. After the spring, it became more and more serious. A large number of victims died every day. As Tang Song and Guo, special commissioners of the Central Supervision and Release, said, if we do not continue to raise large sums of money and provide universal relief, the tragic situation of widespread starvation in Guanzhong in 1929 will surely reappear in Henan. Fang is responsible for Henan's relief and feels anxious. In addition to proposing a proposal for food at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I believe that our country's morality has always been focused on responsibility and comfort. Shanghai is the meeting place of charitable, chivalrous, artistic, and major benefactors. Whenever there is a disaster in the country, they all rush to help and strive to provide relief. The scope of the disaster area and the number of victims in Henan Province this time is unprecedented, and it is located in the Central Plains. The governance, security, and stability are related to the overall situation. At this time of unity against the enemy, it is especially important to help each other in times of crisis. I beg you to show great compassion and initiate fundraising for the disaster victims in Henan Province, so that the day of Henan's people's rebirth will be the day when they do their best to serve the country in return for your kindness."</p>
<p>Organization Meeting Place</p>
<p>Then, Lu Dangping, Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, supplemented the report on the disaster situation, and Wang Xiaolai and others gave speeches, which were omitted. Then, Jiang Yiping proposed to organize a committee to preside over the implementation. It was decided to organize the "Shanghai Relief Committee for the Henan Drought," and set up a meeting place in the Local Association, and drafted a charter. Article 1: The Shanghai Relief Committee is organized by all circles to assist with fundraising for the drought in Henan and is named the Shanghai Relief Committee for the Henan Drought. Article 2: The meeting place of this committee is located in the Local Association in the Zhonghui Building. Article 3: This committee will have several members, who will be publicly elected by the initiators from all walks of life. Article 4: This committee will have one honorary president, six honorary vice presidents, one president, four vice presidents, fifteen standing committee members, one general secretary, and two deputy general secretaries to handle daily affairs, who will be publicly elected by the initiators. Article 5: This committee will have a general affairs group to handle publicity, documents, accounting, general affairs, and public relations. Article 6: This committee will have a fundraising group to handle the collection of donations and articles and the custody of donations. Article 7: Each group will have one director, one deputy director, and several clerks to handle daily affairs. Article 8: The operating expenses of this committee will be freely donated by the initiators and members. Article 9: The committee and the standing committee of this committee will meet once every half a month, convened regularly by the president. Article 10: The working period of this committee is up to two months. Article 11: The detailed rules for this committee will be formulated separately. Article 12: This charter will be implemented from the date of passage.</p>
<p>Nominate Committee Members</p>
<p>Then, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, was appointed Honorary President, Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Zhu Ziqiao, and Xu Shiying were appointed Honorary Vice Presidents, Song Ziwen was appointed President, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Qu Wenliu, and were appointed Vice Presidents, Zhang Shouyong was appointed General Secretary, Li Dachao and Jiang Yiping were appointed Deputy General Secretaries, and more than 60 leading figures from Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, and the banking industry were appointed members. It was established today to carry out fundraising activities.</p>
<h3>Jade Exhibition for the Paris Exposition Opens Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing to Oversee Everything / Unprecedented Event Showcasing the Crystallization of a Century of Jade Art</p>
<p>The preview exhibition of jade art pieces for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition opened yesterday morning on the fourth floor of the Sun Sun Department Store. No ceremony was held. From morning until evening, people from all walks of life in the city were invited to visit. Public viewing will begin tomorrow. Tickets are available for sale at various companies. Group visits will receive special discounts. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Room Full of Treasures</p>
<p>The Emerald Jade Pagoda, which was sent to the Chicago Exposition in the United States three years ago, caused a sensation in Shanghai. It was considered a rare treasure and the crystallization of a century of jade art in China. However, due to the rushed timeframe, it could not be exhibited domestically. The exhibitor, Zhang Wendi, told reporters from the Central News Agency that he deeply regretted this. Therefore, before going to France this time, a preview exhibition was specially held. At the same time, hundreds of pieces of precious jade were collected from domestic collectors and antique dealers, all of which are rare treasures. The room is filled with dazzling displays, truly an unprecedented event in Shanghai in recent years.</p>
<p>Inviting All Sectors</p>
<p>The first day of the opening yesterday morning was an invitation for all sectors. From 10 o'clock, viewers arrived one after another. Mr. Zhang Wendi was on site to receive guests. Mr. Chu Minyi, Chairman of the delegation, came to Shanghai from Nanjing especially and visited the site carefully for a week at eleven o'clock. According to his statement to the Central News Agency reporters, the entries for this competition are very exquisite and numerous, all the result of the efforts of the Chinese people. He is very honored to attend as a representative and hopes to take the time to visit. It is said that the Emerald Pagoda will be offered for sale in France at a good price. When reporters inquired of Mr. Zhang, he denied it. According to him, this item is a rare treasure of modern China, and he deeply hopes that it will not fall into foreign hands. As for the value of the pagoda, it cannot be estimated, but it is said that the insurance is two million yuan.</p>
<p>Exquisite Emerald Pagoda</p>
<p>The layout of the venue is simple and magnificent. The Emerald Pagoda is placed in the center, lined with green silk, and placed on a table. It is two meters high and five meters square. The pagoda has seven levels, modeled after the Longhua Pagoda. The carved railings of each level are particularly exquisite. The pendants and corner bells on the top of the tower are all made of jade. When the breeze passes, the bells ring crisply, like knocking on gold and jade. The interior of the pagoda and the palace lanterns are all equipped with electric torches, shining brightly. The so-called "Three Wonders of Jadeite" is indeed not an empty reputation. The base of the pagoda is exquisitely inlaid with cloisonné enamel, and below it are three layers of mahogany steps. The railings and stone steps are also carved from jade. There is a memorial archway and two palace lanterns, the style is elegant, and the overall figures are finely carved, each vividly portraying the likeness. As for the beauty of the archway, it is another matter. There are also lion, tortoise, crane, sundial and other parts, placed around. The entire project took ten years to complete. It is called a unique treasure of China, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Other Jade Items</p>
<p>This exhibition features an extremely extensive collection of jade items, totaling more than 1,800 pieces, large and small. The preciousness of the jade and the exquisite carving are rarely seen. In addition to the three wonders of the Emerald Jade Pagoda, the archway, and the palace lanterns, there are also coral phoenixes, jade "Four Joys Ascending the Plum Tree" vases, lapis lazuli double chicken cups, amber Cowherd and Weaver Girl, white jade chain vases, Western-style white jade vases, white jade incense burners, emerald openwork flower baskets, five-color jade fishermen's benefit jars, crystal Queen Mother Longevity Star vases, jade landscape plaques, white jade Guanyin, and emeralds in large numbers. Due to space limitations, they could not be fully displayed. It has now been decided to change them every two days for people to appreciate.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Reviews</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaders from all walks of life left inscriptions and comments after the visit. Pan Gongzhan said, "Fantastic and bizarre, surpassing nature's craftsmanship." Xu Peihuang said, "Promoting national essence." Dai Chunfeng said, "Exquisite craftsmanship beyond human capabilities." Jiang Huaishu said, "Valued as a city." Chen Jicheng said, "Rare treasure." Chu Minyi said, "A dazzling array." Lin Kanghou said, "Essence of art." Liang Hancao said, "Extraordinary treasure and divine craftsmanship." Shen Tianxin said, "National essence."

According to Zhang Wendi, speaking to reporters from the Xin Xin News Agency, the jade industry's participation in this exhibition is to demonstrate the essence of Chinese jade art. Li Shizeng said, "Rare treasures." Zhao Jinqing said, "National essence and rare treasures." Wang Yiting said, "Treasure of the world." The association also stipulates preferential treatment for groups. All groups of ten or more people, equipped with formal official letters, can get a 20% discount, but only if ten people go to buy tickets at the same time.</p>

<h3>Mo Keming Discusses the Hainan Island Industrial Inspection Group</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Li Xingqu, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, has invited Mo Keming to Shanghai to meet with Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Economic Commission, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the development of Hainan Island. The organization of an industrial inspection group is progressing smoothly. The reporter met Mr. Mo at the office of Mr. Xiao Songjun, the manager of the Xin Xin Company, yesterday afternoon. According to him, Hainan Island is a barrier for our country's South China Sea, and its climate is suitable, so it is also an excellent industrial area in southern China. All tropical agricultural products such as forests, coffee, rubber, coconuts, and sugar cane are available. Other industries such as mining and fishing can also be developed. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce specially initiated the connection between the industrial circles of Guangzhou and Shanghai to organize an industrial inspection group to go to Hainan Island for inspection as a basis for development. Now Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission, is particularly enthusiastic in supporting this matter. The central government plans to allocate huge funds to first handle Hainan Island's transportation and port construction. At the same time, it advocates that the government should not compete with the people for profits and welcomes capital circles at home and abroad to jointly invest. The negotiations in Shanghai this time went smoothly. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, has separately solicited opinions from banking and other trade associations to send personnel to participate in the inspection group. The National Economic Commission decided to send mining experts and agricultural experts to accompany the inspection group for investigation. Once Shanghai's solicitation is completed, it is planned to gather in Hong Kong and depart in early April, welcoming people from the industrial and financial sectors to actively participate.</p>
<h3>Strike by Machinists at the British Tramway Company</h3>
<p>Party and Government Mediate Yesterday / But No Results</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, Zhang Shunbao and Zhang Shiqing, workers in the machine room of the old Hart Road factory of the British Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession, were fired by the company for exceeding the leave period. After the workers in the factory negotiated with the company, the request to reinstate them was ineffective. Therefore, from 10 o'clock (on the 3rd), 86 workers joined the strike. Yesterday morning, 76 workers at the Huixiao Road factory and 299 workers at the Beikaier Road factory also joined the strike and put forward conditions to negotiate with the capitalists, but were rejected and unresolved. Yesterday, all the workers continued the strike, and the situation was quite serious.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Lu Yinchu of the Municipal Party Department's Civil Movement Section, Yu Yaoqiu of the Investigation Section, Zhu Jintao, a staff member of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gong Yuting of the General Labor Union went to the workers' side to investigate the truth of the strike and separately summoned the foremen of various departments for talks and to discuss solutions. However, the workers' will was quite firm, and it may not be easy to resolve the strike for a while.</p>
<p>Mediation Result</p>
<p>At 2 pm yesterday, the representatives in charge went to the company's general office on North Suzhou Road to meet with manager Evan, vehicle supervisor Broker Hua, compradors Hu Zixing, etc., to mediate. As a result of the mediation, the capitalists agreed to consider handling the wages during the strike period, but did not agree to accept other conditions, so it has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Both Sides' Attitudes</p>
<p>In order to understand the attitude of the workers, a reporter from Da Gong News Agency specifically inquired about their opinions from the workers' representatives. According to them, the workers have put forward seven required conditions, including everything, but in terms of facts, they hope that the company will accept: (1) Fire two workers and allow them to resume work. (2) Regardless of retirement or dismissal, dismissal pay must be given uniformly without limitation of years, one month for one year (and so on). If these two methods are accepted, they will immediately resume work. The company's representatives were then consulted about their opinions. According to the person in charge of the company, the two dismissed workers were actually lazy at ordinary times and often asked for leave, so the company had no choice but to fire them. Now the workers do not understand the truth and suddenly go on strike to make demands, which is unreasonable. The conditions put forward by the workers are difficult to accept, but they hope to uphold the emotions of labor and capital, take into account the transportation business, and resume work immediately, otherwise the company will recruit new workers to maintain business.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at the British-Owned Lun Chang Printing and Dyeing Factory</h3>
<p>Party and Government Mediation Yields No Results</p>
<p>Hundreds of male and female workers in the cloth machine room of the British Lun Chang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, announced a slowdown on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. The dispute was resolved peacefully through negotiations between labor and management and work was restored. Unexpectedly, more than a thousand male and female workers in the yarn spinning room also made demands and stopped working on the 3rd. After the yarn spinning room stopped work, other rooms were also affected, so more than 2,000 male and female workers in the entire factory were virtually in a state of slowdown. According to the company's announcement, the factory has always provided particularly good treatment to workers, and wages are higher than other factories. Even the lowest wages are equal to those of other factories. Moreover, in the depression, the factory is still operating day and night in order to maintain the workers' livelihoods. The factory suddenly went on strike without prior legal procedures to make requests, so the reasons are unknown. Now the factory has notified Ding You to invite 20 representatives to negotiate reasonable solutions, but it said that it is impossible to accept the wage increase, and other matters can be discussed at length. The company authorities posted a notice at the factory gate yesterday morning, announcing a temporary shutdown. The original text of the notice reads: "Our company has always treated workers very well, and wages are also higher than other factories. In recent years, other factories have been suspended due to the impact of the depression, and our company has tried to maintain operations in order to take care of the workers' livelihoods and avoid difficulties in their lives. All of these are obvious to all, but recently a part of our company's spinning workers suddenly made unreasonable demands and disrupted the factory, causing losses to the company, which is regrettable. Therefore, our company will temporarily suspend operations until there is a satisfactory solution between the two parties."</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, after being informed of the situation, the Municipal Party Department sent Li Weixiong and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Chuqiang to Pudong at 2 pm yesterday to join Zhang Mingqin, the Director of the Pudong Police Sub-bureau, to first summon more than 20 representatives of textile workers at the sub-bureau to investigate the truth of the labor dispute and inquire about the purpose of the demands. Then they went to the factory to mediate. The capitalists said that it was possible to continue the treatment portion, but refused to accept the wage portion and there was no room for accommodation, resulting in no results in the mediation. It is now known that representatives of party and government agencies are scheduled to conduct mediation again this morning to eliminate the dispute as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The National United Association of New Pharmaceutical Industries sent a letter to its members yesterday, stating: "Regarding the general registration of prepared medicines, although the deadline has passed, due to the time required for chemical testing, most licenses have not yet been issued. Therefore, this association petitioned the Ministry of Health to allow for a temporary, flexible approach during this transitional period. A reply was received from the Ministry of Health (Medical Department Document No. 343), stating that after examining the provisions of Article 12 of the Revised Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines regarding prepared medicines that violate Article 2, the Ministry must approve any penalties. The Ministry has also issued instructions regarding the meaning of 'obtained' in Article 12 and circulated them to provincial and municipal governments for compliance. If a prepared medicine has already been submitted to the Ministry for testing and inspection, the local government should temporarily suspend any inspection or prohibition until the Ministry has reviewed and rejected it. There is no need to discuss any provisions regarding exemptions. Therefore, this letter is being sent for your information and compliance."</p>
<h3>Penalties for Food Stores, etc., Not Donating License</h3>
<p>A Total of Over Forty Businesses</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Health has always stipulated that food stores, laundry shops, caterers, etc., must donate (to) a permit, in order to facilitate the management of hygiene facilities. However, a recent investigation revealed that over one thousand such businesses have not complied with the order to donate a license. Because they have not donated a license, it is impossible to verify whether the hygiene facilities of these stores are adequate, which is extremely relevant to the health of the people in the concession. Therefore, subordinates were instructed to conduct a thorough investigation. Any businesses found to have not donated for a license will be served a ticket to appear in the First Special District Court to be penalized. Yesterday afternoon, over forty businesses were prosecuted by the Bureau of Health. The Public Concession's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, appeared in court, requesting strict penalties. Judge Ye Shengchao considered the circumstances of the cases and imposed appropriate fines on each one.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Explains Ambiguities in Stamping</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce explained two ambiguities regarding stamp duties yesterday as follows: ㊀Regarding your letter of the 4th of this month inquiring whether price draft books should be stamped, this matter was addressed in a document issued by the Ministry of Finance (Taxation Document No. 18917) on October 17, 1935, to Cheng Jiyun, Commissioner of Stamp Tax Inspection, stating that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had previously inquired about whether correspondence books used by stores should be stamped. The Ministry verified that they do not need to be stamped. Therefore, correspondence books can also be exempted from stamping. Also, in a document issued by the Ministry of Finance (Taxation Document No. 22002) on January 27, 1936, to Gu Xiance, Commissioner of Stamp Tax Inspection, it was stated that correspondence books used by stores are only used for communication and record-keeping, so they do not need to be stamped. Therefore, you can follow these guidelines and do not need to stamp them. ㊁Regarding your letter of the 4th of this month stating that your factory uses a fiscal year system for closing accounts, and that it appears that the years 1926 and 1931 have already passed, inquiring whether it is necessary to add additional stamps. According to the regulations in the second half of Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, "If accounts are closed according to a fiscal year, the deadline should be the end of the fiscal year. Any continued use beyond the deadline should require additional stamp tax." Therefore, merchants who close accounts according to a fiscal year do not need to add stamps to their books before the end of the fiscal year, as permitted by law. However, for the sake of clarity during inspections, it is advisable to stamp the first page of the book with the words "This factory's fiscal year is from [Month] of each year to [Month] of the following year," which would be more prudent.</p>
<h3>Dongting Dongshan Native Place Association Held Solicitation Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Three Gambling Cases Broken in One Night on Roads Beyond the Settlement in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Road and Haige Road in western Shanghai were built beyond the boundaries of the French Concession by the French Bureau of Public Works. Recently, due to strict enforcement against gambling in the urban areas, gamblers have been secretly gathering in the French Concession to gamble. The head of the Lujiiawan General Patrol Station reported this to the relevant authorities. On the night before last, at 9:00 PM, he ordered all members of the gambling arrest team to go to arrest gamblers. At two locations, Chenjia Lane on Haige Road and Chengdeli near the bridge on Xujiahui Road, forty to fifty gamblers were arrested, and a large amount of gambling money and equipment was confiscated. At 11:30 PM, in a three-story building above the Yong Maode Bowl Store at 1221 on Xujiahui Road across from the Second Road Tram Stop, people were also gambling at Pai Gow. As soon as the detectives entered, three or four people jumped out of the window in an attempt to escape, resulting in broken hands and feet and head injuries, as well as knocked-out teeth. After being stopped by the detectives, over thirty gamblers were arrested, and over eighty yuan in gambling money was confiscated, along with gambling equipment, and taken back to the patrol station for interrogation at the Second Special Court. It is reported that Zeng, a police officer from the Xujiahui Town Police Station, was also arrested in the building. After a pistol was found in his possession, he was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for disposal yesterday.</p>
<h3>Investigation Reveals Robbers Were Deserters Who Repeatedly Committed Robberies in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Previously Robbed Passengers on a Bus; Several Accomplices Arrested and Taken to the Police Station for Interrogation</p>
<p>On February 21st, a robbery occurred near Meixie Road in Nanshi. Huang Genrong, a 29-year-old Shandong native residing at 13 Xiangcheng Lane, Xinqiao Road in South Shanghai, who previously worked as a waterworks craftsman, was robbed of over 50 yuan in legal tender at around 8:00 AM that morning and was shot in the foot. He was accompanied by two friends to Renji Hospital for treatment. It has been learned that this case has some suspicious points, so the patrol officers escorted the two accompanying people to the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. After investigation by the leader of the fifth detective squad, it was revealed that the two accompanying people, Tian Houyin, 29 years old, from Shandong, residing at 13, Alley 611, Xietu Road, and Zhu Youxin, 32 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at 16 Fuxing Lane, Xinqiao Road, who sells salted fish for a living, and it was also discovered that there was no robbery in the Meixie Road area of Nanshi at the time. After strict interrogation, Tian Houyin confessed that the person who was shot, Huang Genrong, whose real name is Yu Xingcheng, was previously a soldier in the security team in Wuxi. He deserted with a Mauser pistol and came to Shanghai. They intended to commit robbery, but accidentally, the gun went off, causing injury to the leg. There is also an accomplice, Zhao Rulin, 33 years old, from Tianjin, who is hiding at 88 Ruanle Lane, Tangjiawan in the French Concession. They will join the French patrol officers and rush to arrest the suspect Zhao and the suspect Yao Baosen, Zhao's mistress, Yan Wangshi. According to Zhao's confession, accomplices Tian San (still at large) and the wounded Yu Xingcheng, Tian Houyin, etc., robbed passengers on a bus on the evening of January 7th, and robbed Zhixiang Rice Shop on Jumen Road of 6-700 yuan in legal tender on January 11th, as well as eight cases including Ronghua Coal Ball Factory at 538 Liyuan Road, Tongshun Paper Shop on Puyuxi Road, Dafeng Paper Shop on Sanguantang, and Zhenxiang Paper Shop at 282 Zhangminan Zhe Road on January 29th. A Mauser pistol stolen by Yu Xingcheng in Wuxi was seized from Zhu Youxin's home, with the gun number 68089, the fire brand 00166, and five bullets. After the gun went off at the time, it was thrown and hidden in Zhu's home, causing him to be implicated. The suspect Gao Yuqi, 36 years old, from Qingjiang, was not arrested and was sent to the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Savings of Over Ten Years of Fishing Lost After Arriving in Shanghai Due to Fraud</h3>
<p>False Claims that the Shopkeeper Absconded with Funds; Jiang Huan Accused of Fraud and Deception</p>
<p>Du Riyuan, a 48-year-old man from Muping, Shandong, has been fishing in Vladivostok for over ten years. He had modest savings and returned to China at the end of last year's lunar calendar. While passing through Shanghai, he was introduced by Jiang Yun, a fellow villager who also runs a small business in Vladivostok, to stay at the Xingfa Company, which belongs to Jiang Yun's cousin, Jiang Huan, at [Number] Huicheng Lane, Maidie'an Road, in the French Concession. Recently, Du has filed a suit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Jiang Huan, the owner of Xingfa Company, of fraud and deception and requesting legal action. According to his complaint, he arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok with Jiang Yun. Jiang Yun arranged for him to stay at the defendant's Xingfa Company. On December 14th of the lunar calendar, the defendant told the plaintiff that if he had money, he should deposit it in the accounting room, otherwise, they would not be responsible for any losses. Therefore, he deposited the US$230 in banknotes that he had brought with him in the defendant's accounting room. The next day, he deposited another 66 yuan and 2 jiao in national currency, which he had obtained by exchanging US$20. On the 24th, the defendant suddenly claimed that the head shopkeeper of the company had absconded with funds and was unable to return the deposited funds. He then claimed that there were still over 800 yuan in the accounting room's safe and that he could find a way to open it and distribute the money to the plaintiff and Jiang Yun for return. When the coppersmith was called to open it, there were only 81 yuan inside the safe. After deducting 2 yuan for the coppersmith, the net remaining was 79 yuan, and the plaintiff only received 49 yuan. Waiting until the 27th, the head shopkeeper still had not returned, so he went to the patrol station with the defendant. The defendant promised to compensate, but has not done so. The defendant is actually deliberately defrauding and encroaching on the funds and requests legal investigation. Based on the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, arranged for Judge Qiu to preside over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff arrived with his lawyer, but the defendant did not appear. The court stated that since the defendant did not appear, the trial could not proceed and announced that the defendant would be summoned again for the trial on the 9th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Private Salt Smuggler Gets Revenge, Pushing Anti-Smuggling Officer into the River</h3>
<p>Patrol Station Prosecutes for Attempted Murder</p>
<p>Ye Xinkang, a Ningbo native residing at 6 Zhicheng Lane, Fuyou Road in the Chinese-administered area of this city, makes a living by selling private salt. In August of last year, while transporting private salt to the French Concession, he was discovered by Zhou Changyou, an anti-smuggling officer from Qingjiang, and was arrested and prosecuted in the Second Special Court. Ye was sentenced to three months in prison. As a result, Ye and Zhou became enemies. On the morning of January 19th of this year, Ye Xinkang was transporting a load of private salt again to sell on a Yangtze River liner and was transporting it to Jinliyuan Wharf No. 2 when he was discovered by Zhou Changyou again. Ye took advantage of Zhou's lack of preparedness and pushed Zhou into the Huangpu River. He turned around and escaped. After falling into the river, Zhou was rescued by the efforts of a sampan boatman nearby and sent to the French patrol station to report the incident. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. On the 20th of this month, Ye Xinkang was arrested by the Municipal Police Bureau in the Chinese-administered area on suspicion of robbery. The French patrol station learned of this and yesterday learned that Ye had been transferred to their custody. He was sent to the Second Court for trial and detention pending investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court presided over a continued trial of the defendant in the First Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahuang, a lawyer from the medical office, presented the case, prosecuting the defendant under Article 135 and Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder. The defendant Ye Xinkang's confession was evasive and denied the charges. After reviewing the confession, the court announced that the witness would be summoned again on the 9th for further questioning, and the defendant would be returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association Contributes Opinions on Seizure of Land</h3>
<p>If Specific Plots Are Indicated, They Can Be Responsible for Accurate Seizure</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday submitted a document to the Shanghai District Court and the First and Second Special District Courts, stating: "Regarding a request for submission, it is reported that member Xu Zuoliang proposed: 'The enforcement of judgments is the responsibility of the court. All Chinese government agencies have an obligation to assist in the execution of the court. Recently, the Shanghai District Court has required creditors to investigate the plot numbers and acreage of the debtor's land before seizing it. When inquired about the reason, it was said that the seizure of land now requires notifying the Land Bureau to send personnel to jointly survey the land, but the Land Bureau refuses to send personnel because the plot numbers and acreage of the land have not been reported.' According to the investigation, the joint survey and measurement of the land to be seized has no legal basis. Now, it is even more inappropriate to refuse seizure because the plot number of the land is unknown. Since our country's land registration has not yet been established and the land has not been reorganized, how can the plot number of the debtor's land be ascertained? Since the Land Bureau is a Chinese government agency and is allowed to send personnel for joint seizure, if the Land Bureau does not assist the court in executing the general principles by investigating and filling out the land register, or ordering the local land guard to report, then who will have the opportunity to ascertain the plot number of the land? In 1935, the Land Bureau replied to the association, stating, 'Regarding the appraisal of land prices requested by various courts in this city, we follow the procedures stipulated by this bureau. Except for the appraisal of land that requires prior surveying and measurement, and cases where the reported plot number is incorrect, or the location is unclear, requiring the land guard to investigate and demarcate the boundaries, and single contracts with other disputes, which are temporarily difficult to complete within the time limit, we will complete the task within ten days of receiving the document. In light of this, when the parties report an incorrect plot number or an unclear location, the Land Bureau has impartially assisted and executed its duties by investigating. Why is it that only because the parties do not know the plot number of the land, they will not assist in the seizure? This seems to be not considerate enough to protect the interests of the creditors.' In light of this, we should send separate letters to the local courts and the Land Bureau. In the future, when creditors request the seizure of land, if they can be responsible for specifying the location, even if the plot number is not clear, the Land Bureau should investigate and report, or order the land guard to report, before the Land Bureau has reorganized the land register and made it public, and still seize the land to comply with the law." The 24th joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the association discussed this matter and believed that Xu's proposal was not without merit and that separate letters should be sent to the courts and the Land Bureau. In addition to sending separate letters, we urgently request that your court review and approve the following: In the future, when creditors request the seizure of land, if they can specify the location and be responsible for its accuracy, even if the plot number is not clear, we should ask the Land Bureau to investigate and report by its authority, or order the land guard to report, and still seize the land before the Land Bureau has reorganized the land register and made it public, which would be very convenient for the public.</p>

It is said that Li was unhappy that the cotton quilt his wife made was too small, and Li was speechless, so he had the thought of committing suicide by hanging himself.

<h3>Representative of the Party Department Stationed in Vietnam Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Zhou Qichu, the representative of the General Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang stationed in Annam, along with Zheng Manlin, an executive member of the branch, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Guangzhou on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship "Haiyuan." They stayed at the Dongya Hotel and took a fast train to Beijing at noon for official business. Zhou is a native of Nanhai, Guangdong, and currently serves as a standing committee member and head of the organization section of the Executive Committee of the General Branch stationed in Annam, honorary advisor to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, director-general of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese General Labour Union, secretary of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Vietnam, and head of the business department of the Annam Minbao newspaper directly under the Central Government. He has been in Vietnam for over twenty years and is very familiar with the situation there. According to him, there are many special circumstances overseas that cannot be conveyed through writing, so a special envoy must be sent to meet with the central authorities to explain everything in person. This is the reason why he was appointed to return to China. Vietnam is a place where Sun Yat-sen once travelled and deeply sowed the seeds of revolution. Revolutionary pioneers, before the restoration, considered it easy to coordinate because it was adjacent to the motherland. For example, former Chairman Hu Hanmin and Chairman Wang Jingwei successively came to Vietnam to guide comrades and organize institutions. Therefore, in various revolutionary uprisings, comrades from that area participated and sacrificed their lives to a great extent. There are over ten thousand party members there. The general branch is located in Dike, Annam, and oversees ten branches and more than sixty sub-branches. All cities and important towns in Vietnam have party organizations, which cooperate well with the local overseas Chinese. Therefore, the promotion of public welfare, relief for disasters in the motherland, and national salvation movements have achieved excellent results. For example, after the outbreak of national crisis and the January 28th Incident, overseas Chinese enthusiastically contributed financially to support the border. During the floods in the motherland the previous year, people from all walks of life donated money for relief. Many overseas Chinese schoolteachers participated, and the academic community promoted the sale of admission tickets, raising eight or ninety thousand yuan in an instant. Even recently, the aid to Suiyuan is no less enthusiastic than before. The port has been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, and the number of overseas Chinese returning to China is increasing daily. It was previously reported that there were 400,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, but now only half remain. Vietnam is most famous for its rice production. In the past, most of the rice milling industry (i.e., powered rice mills) was run by overseas Chinese, but it has now mostly changed hands. The current resident government is implementing a new system, stipulating that workers' working hours should not exceed eight hours. As a result, unemployment among factory workers has decreased. Last year, the franc depreciated, and prices rose slightly. In the past, the rice trade relied on sales to China, but since the imposition of taxes, Europe has purchased a lot of rice, and very little is transported to Hong Kong. Currently, there are Chinese consuls there. The consulate general is in Hanoi, North Vietnam, and the consulate is located in Saigon. Overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam pay a personal tax of 30 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen per year. If they open a store, they pay a business license tax, which ranges from dozens to over a thousand yuan depending on the size of the business. Last year, the election of candidates for the National Assembly was held there, and overseas Chinese participated enthusiastically in the election. It was found that the area should have two National Assembly representatives. According to the organizational law, several people must be elected first, and the central government will select three from them. The remaining six people will then be re-elected by the overseas Chinese to select three official representatives. The elected candidates are Lin Zechen (Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner of the National Government), Zhang Guowei (Colonel Secretary of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters), Liu Houwu (Commissioner of the Control Yuan), Tao Duiting (Director of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce), Xiang Yutang (Standing Committee Member of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese General Labour Union), Liu Zeng (Chairman of the Xidi Qifu Public Office), Wang Yusen (Chairman of the Hakka Chongzheng General Association), Cao Yunze (Former President of the General Chamber of Commerce), and Xu Yixian (Secretary of the General Chamber of Commerce). I have been abroad for a long time. This time I returned to China to observe the construction and found that the progress is improving rapidly, which is refreshing. This shows the result of the hard work of the government authorities in recent years.</p>

<h3>County Government Prepares for Arbor Day Ceremony</h3>

It was resolved to hold it at 9:00 AM on March 12th at the Chongnong Hall of the Zhuanqiao People's School on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. ㊁ A motion was made to invite members to arrange the facilities for the Arbor Day ceremony. It was resolved to invite the Third District Office, together with the Zhong'an Township Office and the Zhong'an People's School, to be responsible for handling it. ㊂ Regarding the trees planted in the county's newly built park that are damaged or missing, how should they be replanted completely, and how should special management measures be formulated? It was resolved to invite Director Qi Kezhong and District Head Zhang Fengsan to draft special management measures and investigate the damage and missing trees, and to find ways to replant them. ㊃ Regarding the roadside trees on the Shanghai-Minhang and Shanghai-Songjiang highways in the county, which should be planted by the respective transportation companies according to regulations, but have not been planted or replanted completely after repeated orders, how should they be supervised to proceed? It was resolved to order them to replant all trees by the 20th of this month. After the discussion was concluded, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai County Education Bureau believes that planting trees in schools not only beautifies the environment but also complies with school hygiene. Yesterday, it specially issued a notice to its subordinates to tidy up the trees on campus during this year's Arbor Day. If there are any trees that have not been planted, they must be planted during this festival. The required seedlings can be collected from the seedling field of the Qianqiao People's Education Center. The Jiangwan Office of the Chamber of Commerce is handling the matter on their behalf.</p>

<h3>After Separating from His Wife, Wang Ligang Sued His Lover for Divorce</h3>
<p>Wang Ligang, a native of Ningbo, is 30 years old and a shareholder of Wang Shunchang Tailor Shop at 421 Jing'an Temple Road. In November of the 15th year of the Republic (1926), he married Fu Meiyu (currently 29 years old), a woman from his hometown. Before a year had passed, the couple's relationship was not very harmonious, and they finally decided to separate. Wang paid her 30 yuan per month for living expenses. She lived alone at No. 1 Xinmin Lane, Bairbu Road, and later moved to Dongyouheng Road for about seven or eight years. The couple only existed in name and never saw each other. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Wang met Chen Yuliang, a native of Baoshan. Initially, it was only a friendly relationship, but because Meiyu became seriously ill, Chen Yuliang accompanied her bedside day and night, decocting medicine and serving her. Meiyu was touched by Chen's sincerity and repaid him with her body, living together and forming a small family at No. 7, Lane 370, Yuanfang Road. Wang Ligang learned of this and, at the cost of 30 yuan per month, ended up with a cuckold. He was greatly angered and reported the matter to the police in September of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), arresting Meiyu and Chen and sending them to the First Special Court. Fu Meiyu was sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a three-year reprieve. Chen Yuliang was found not guilty because he did not know that Fu Meiyu was married. Now, Wang Ligang believes that his wife's actions are irreversible, so he hired lawyer Jiang Rong to file a lawsuit in the local court requesting a divorce. Judge Wang Yi opened the court yesterday, but neither party was present. Only the plaintiff's agent, Lawyer Jiang, appeared in court and requested a default judgment. The judge ordered that a new summons be issued for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Accomplice in the Wang Ada Murder Case Captured While on the Run</h3>
<p>Wang Ada, a local who served as an inspector (i.e., detective) in the Zhabei Public Security Bureau, was lured out of the Sihai Teahouse on Dongxi Huade Road at around 2:00 PM on February 19th of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) by his enemies, who shot him in the head, intending to take his life, and fled in a panic. Subsequently, the police arrested the perpetrators Zhang Xingsheng, Tang Xinfa, and others, and sent them to the First Special District Court. After questioning, they were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. They confessed that the mastermind, Zhu Atang (also known as Little Ghost Atang), a native of Ningbo, was on the run. At around 8:00 AM on the morning of the previous day, Chinese Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Xia Shutang learned that he was hiding at the Tangshan Hotel at No. 434 Tangshan Road in the Canal District. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Public Works Department explained the case and prosecuted him for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting a postponement. Subsequently, the victim Wang Ada testified about the circumstances of being ambushed and shot at the time, and Zhu Atang's testimony was evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The "Municipal Donation" in Extraterritorial Road Sections</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Shanghai has concessions, and there are also so-called "extraterritorial road sections." Originally, the municipal authority in the "extraterritorial road sections" belonged to our national municipal government, and the houses on both sides were also marked with city boundary plaques, and the municipal finance bureau sent personnel to collect municipal donations. Also, the municipal police bureau sent standing posts on the road to protect public security. Now, a sudden piece of news says that the Public Concession authorities plan to collect municipal donations from the owners of various businesses in the "extraterritorial road sections" and threaten to cut off water and electricity. Obviously, this issue has developed significantly. In addition to hoping that the municipal authorities will strive for our national sovereignty, we have the following supplementary opinions.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of "extraterritorial road sections," there have been negotiations on "recovering extraterritorial roads" in the past, but the result of the negotiations between the municipal authorities and the Public Concession authorities was that "due to various relationships, a thorough solution could not be obtained," and later it was suspended halfway. For a long time, we did not hear of any "thorough solution," and it has been silent. However, silence is certainly not a solution. This time, the Public Concession authorities' plan to collect municipal donations from property owners is a great lesson for us: if it is not a thorough solution, then it is not a solution. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Public Concession's method of collecting municipal donations this time is still the traditional method of "threatening to cut off water and electricity." This method has given us many lessons, but each time we still concede and succumb, because for merchants, this is a very big threat. They cannot live without water and electricity for a day, so even if they suffer a little loss, they are willing to deal with it carelessly. The "municipal donation" incident has already had a similar result. From this, we can know that the ending this time is in danger of repeating the mistakes. If we do not seek a comprehensive solution urgently, then it will be another terrible thing. According to the water and electricity issues of the "extraterritorial road sections," "in the extraterritorial road section of North Sichuan Road, most of the water and electricity have been supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In the western part of Shanghai, electricity supply" is only "handled by the Shanghai West Electricity Company established with the approval of the municipal government," but all of this is "distant water cannot quench a present thirst," and a few property owners cannot help but "endure the pain and accept it." Isn't this another mistake of not being able to thoroughly solve the problem?</p>
<p>However, we cannot have any understanding of the few property owners who "endure the pain and accept it." The issue of the "municipal donation" in the extraterritorial road sections is related to the infringement of our national sovereignty. "Enduring the pain and accepting it" cannot protect national sovereignty, and it hinders the progress of "striving for it." This is, in any case, a foolish method of "living in the moment and taking chances." At the same time, the "municipal donation" in the extraterritorial road sections is also a whole and indivisible, and it cannot be partially solved by a few "enduring the pain and accepting it." Moreover, "enduring the pain and accepting it" will only cause greater "pain" and will not eliminate "pain." Therefore, we hope that the authorities will not forget to persuade this group of minority property owners who are willing to "succumb" and "endure the pain" while "striving for it." At the same time, we hope to analyze and solve the reasons why they "endure the pain." However, now it is still time to "mend the fold after losing the sheep." We must not only properly resolve the dispute over the "municipal donation," but also clear up the long-standing files on "recovering extraterritorial roads."</p>
<h3>The Trap of Great Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>There is a lady who wrote a "reportage," reporting the facts of her three encounters with traps while seeking employment in this Great Shanghai. The first trap she encountered was: a back alley elementary school. It turned out that the twenty-seven-year-old principal wanted to hire a female teacher in order to prepare her to be his wife; the second trap was: a small hospital that defrauded her of cash guarantees; the third trap was: a guide not much different from a prostitute.</p>
<p>When that lady went to contact the female teacher, standing in front of a school building consisting of two houses, she was stunned like this: "A school building of two shikumen houses, can it be considered a noble educational institution! I'm afraid it's a school shop that defrauds tuition fees! Can I bear to be a degenerate in the educational world?" This is, first, is the back alley elementary school completely a "school shop that defrauds tuition fees"? Therefore, second, even if the education world is full of degenerates, can we bear to watch these degenerates in the education world? If we have a little bit of initiative, we should go deep into the degenerate camp, "How can you get cubs without entering the tiger's den?" We absolutely cannot wear white gloves and let the degenerates remain degenerates forever.</p>
<p>When that lady escaped from the room that recruited guides, how angry she was! She wrote: "At this time, consciousness told me that this is a trap that forces me to sell my body and soul, what is an employee, it is simply a guide not much different from a prostitute! I am unwilling to die, no matter how poor, how can I entangle with these beast-like people to pollute my pure and noble personality." Here, first, are "these beast-like people" willing? Or are they, like that lady, forced by hunger and cold, and out of helplessness? Second, are "these beast-like people" truly morally corrupt? Is the corruption or nobility of personality because of the selling of the body? How many women, for the sake of chastity, endure cold and hunger, and even commit suicide out of shame and anger after losing their virginity, is unknown! This is the feudal concept of chastity, which has killed many people! At the same time, this feudal concept of chastity, I don't know how many pitiful women, are regarded as "beast-like people"! I want to shout out loud and protest for those pitiful women!</p>
<p>Although that lady encountered traps three times, she was not discouraged at all, she "worked harder to study and hoped to learn skills, be able to enter a legitimate professional institution, and use her own strength to exchange for her own life." This is commendable, but the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day, I am afraid this is not an illusion? Moreover, how many of the so-called "legitimate professional institutions" under the moon are not similar to traps for women?</p>
<p>The suffering of women…</p>
<h3>Spring Breeze Success</h3>
<p>— Zheng Rong</p>
<p>Successful Career</p>
<p>The phrase "spring breeze success" has two meanings: one meaning is that "the spring breeze is gentle and successful," and one meaning is that "during the spring breeze, people's careers can be successful."</p>
<p>If a person is tired in spirit and weak in body during this intoxicating spring breeze, then he will fail this great spring, and his career will not be "successful" at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone with an unhealthy body should take advantage of this spring season to take effective medicinal products, such as those with insufficient blood, should take the blood-replenishing "Zilai Blood." Those with insufficient lung qi should take "Wuzhou Milky White Cod Liver Oil" or "Globe Brand Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil." Because these three are famous tonics, with the reputation of "Three Heroes of Tonics" in normal times, now many successful people in society usually take these tonics to strengthen their bodies. I think that if the sick and weak can listen to me and take them every day, then this year, he can turn weakness into strength, and when the spring breeze comes next year, his career will definitely be successful.</p>
<h3>Evening Sky Longing</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>The chimney crawling on top of the village meeting hall spews wisps of white smoke, slowly dissipating in the smoky clouds of the twilight sky, turning into a melancholy mood that is hard to conceal; the western mountain supports the setting sun, and the shadows of the towering objects are dragged longer on the ground. There is no beautiful scenery of the sunset glow, this is a sad dusk.</p>
<p>The endless fields, the endless wheat seedlings, embroidered into boundless greenery, pouring out滔天碧浪. The crawling hills, the raised mounds, the Chinese tallow trees on the mounds have long shed the fallen leaves of red faces, leaving only the clumsy withered trunks, there to lament the passing of youth; the red leaves full of poetry, today also quietly snuggle against the soil, no more poets come here to chant farewells to the autumn waves. The sandy dust and withered leaves, like hating the exclusive beauty of the peach blossoms, rustle and roll up a whirlwind, knocking down the scattered flowers. Let the sobbing of the fallen flowers, let the silent sigh of the withered trees, only leaving the mockery of the cold wind, no more joyful奏樂of the鳴虫. The luxuriant grass does not透蔓延the business, quietly sighing out the desolation of fate. The distant city walls and ancient roads show an ancient and unbearable sorrow in the setting sun, and the eternal desolation.</p>
<p>In this corner that the eye can see, many lonely and monotonous scenes appear.</p>
<p>On the red mud road opened from the mountains and fields, there are often cars whizzing by - or it is the vitality that this corner of the world actually has. The village houses stand by the country road, and outside the hedge gate leans an ancient heart;凄</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>萋temples, the infinite wrinkles of remembrance and sorrow: all write out the chaos of this heart. Using all the remaining strength in life, closely watching the distant sky and sea, the faint clouds in the sky and sea, gently fly over one mountain peak after another ridge, the heart of a慈母, in the evening breeze and floating clouds, is even more sadly boundless.</p>
<p>By the ancient road, in the car, she earnestly seeks an object of her lifelong sorrow - the young son slowly returning from afar, to comfort the loneliness of the elderly, and to温回the enthusiasm she had long lost.</p>
<p>Crows crow in阵阵over the horizon, mothers calling their children to投进the long forest of the distant mountains. These filial慈鳥, their home, must be so passionate and comfortable, filled with the joy of reunion; in the home of the elderly; there is only the煢煢lamp light,凄凄accompanying the lonely thin shadow; the slow long night, it is difficult to find a good dream of游子returning home. Often because of the西風hitting the tiles, the狂吠of野狗, the蕭索of残葉; it is considered to be the履歩of游子returning home overnight: the慈母in暮年will冲开the陰寒and恐怖of深夜,幽幽wait in the bottomless darkness until dawn. But難眠輾轉,空数尽every rotation of time, listening to the哀诉of殘更漏;霜华重露, only she独领the寂静of the world. This暮天, this静悄悄country road, who will投给her a丝儿慰藉! ?</p>
<p>The setting sun has 收尽了the last brilliance, and the twilight色is gradually加浓. The灰黯night fog climbs up the roofs of people's houses,爬近the身旁of暮年people;遮糢糊了the outline of the distant mountains,遮濃厚了the寂静of the頽城古道. On the頽枝of乌柏, a few凄宿乱鳥often leave the branches unsteadily because of a gust of wind, a一声狗呌, and徘徊in the昏茫evening sky,哀哀singing out the misery of无家无恃,一声声呌痛the heart of the暮年people.</p>
<p>The evening wind撩起a惊人的怪呌,掀起the 衣角of暮年people,拂乱斑斑the鬓发,使the old and weak心神, in the阴冷的威胁里抖索……But the暮年慈母still can't bear to leave this处所;彷彿the昏茫twilight色will迷失the归家of游子.</p>
<h3>Violet</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>I can't remember when I started to love flowers.</p>
<p>Maybe, my recent life has been too leisurely. Often when I have nothing to do, I always want to find some pastime that suits my personality, or some entertainment that I like, to serve as a decoration in my life; however, there are really too few pastimes or entertainment that can suit my personality and that I like.</p>
<p>For the sake of my lung disease, the doctor once specified a very long period for me to recuperate, and he also forbade me to read newspapers, read books, and write articles. So, hoping to prolong my life, I was helplessly forced to return to my hometown. In the countryside, life is very monotonous, with no entertainment, no pastime, I haven't approached books and newspapers for a long time, and even if writing is not forbidden, I am too lazy to do it. Everything seems to be isolated in another world; moreover, every move of mine is monitored by my family, which is almost the same as eating官司in prison.</p>
<p>So, this is how I started to love flowers.</p>
<p>There was originally a garden in our home, but no one has ever tidied it up. The flower paths are not swept, the garden gate is often closed, and it is too desolate to look like anything.</p>
<p>Finally, because I had no place to spend the boring time day after day, I tidied up the garden, looked for many exotic flowers and rare herbs and evergreen trees, and planted them inside. Over the past year, this lonely garden has actually become a very lively flower garden.</p>
<p>In the early morning, whenever the sound of the cock crowing荡漾in the misty air, when every flower in the garden is刚沐着in the晶莹morning dew, I stand in front of the flowers, under the trees,鉴赏着the惺忪posture摇曳of every flower, gently swaying in the熹微morning light, like a妍丽多姿young girl, she is含情脉脉地, smiling and招手towards me.</p>
<p>Last year, a friend gave me a pot of violets; I left half of it in the pot, and divided the other half and transplanted it to the small pond in the garden. When he gave it to me, it was exactly April last year, the clusters of青翠碧绿leaves were covered with many细碎purple small flowers; the花萼is very奇特, a kind of馥郁芳香播送着, but it does not have the诱人的刺激香味of other flowers.</p>
<p>It is said that it can bloom twice a year, which is rare in evergreen species. I love it very much, I love it for having the fragrance of roses, but not as艳as roses, having the perseverance of plum blossoms, but more清高than plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Now, it is its flowering season again, and the clusters of青翠碧绿leaves are covered with many细碎purple small flowers. I love it for散着温馨气息in the sun, and I also love its艳丽姿态浸润in the rain and dew.</p>
<p>Whether in the 清晨or傍晚of every day, I always like to留连in this garden once, which has almost become my daily habit.</p>
<p>The color of the violet is not艳不淡, the fragrance of the violet is 香而不烈, it is just like a淡装雅緻and静娴girl. In my garden, I take care of it and cultivate it carefully, like taking care of my lover; in winter, I cover it with稻草at night, and in summer, I use curtains to挡了the过烈的阳光for it during the day, I watch it become more and more繁荣day by day, from a small clump to a large clump, and then I transplant it to many places.</p>
<p>Recently, my illness has gradually recovered, and for the sake of life and burden, I have left my hometown again, left that beloved garden, and what is especially worth依恋is that cluster of lovely violets.</p>
<p>It's spring, are the violets无恙耶,怅望着天涯, I can't help but伤感起来like missing a lover.</p>
