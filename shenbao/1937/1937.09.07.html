<h3>我勇猛精銳部隊浴血反攻寶山敵軍已完全擊潰</h3>
<p>殘敵向吳淞逃竄異常狼狽　獅子林方面昨有激烈礮戰　我空軍戰士擊燬敵艦兩艘　瀏河敵登陸企圖失敗</p>
<p>連日敵增援二師團到滬後、以全力侵犯我寶山縣城、我軍為保持實力計、略向後撤、但我軍一營、始終留守城內待援、昨晨我精銳生力軍趕到、下令全綫反攻、展開滬戰以來最猛烈之惡戰、我軍有進無退、勇氣萬倍、向敵肉搏衝擊、敵亦拼力頑抗、我逐步進逼、戰至下午三時半、寶山城廂敵軍被我完全擊潰、向吳淞鎮逃竄、我軍乘勝追擊、敵屍遍野、而堂堂靑天白日滿地紅之國旗、乃復飄揚於寶山城樓上、民衆夾道歡呼、熱烈情景、得未曾有、誠為滬戰以來我軍最光榮之戰績、至獅子林方面、敵艦集結數十艘、不斷開砲向我陣地轟擊、並掩護其由寶山另股竄出之部隊前進、圖窺月浦鎮、業經我軍擊退、截至今晨三時止、我月浦羅店陣綫無變動、至楊樹浦方面、敵軍在虬江碼頭沙灘上岸、謀與張華浜殘敵取得連絡、我軍正嚴密監視、卽當予以掃蕩、江灣閘北方面雙方僅有砲戰、刻仍在原陣綫對峙中、</p>
<h3>我精銳部隊猛烈反攻寶山城完全解圍</h3>
<p>中央社、前傳寶山縣城淪陷、茲悉當時我軍一營始終留守城內待援、不肯後退、澈夜與敵血戰、至昨晨十時、猶在交鋒、敵軍前夜曾派一部兵力、越寶山城向我獅子林及月浦綫前進、同時我增援之某精銳部隊、亦已趕到、與敵遭遇肉搏、敵軍傷亡極重、不支潰退、我軍乘勝猛烈追擊、至昨晨進至距寶山三里之三官堂、此時敵應援部隊到達、再度猛戰、我軍勢如潮湧、忘命前進、喊殺之聲、震驚天地、至下午一時許更逼近城郊、相距祇一里、敵軍仍作困獸之鬥、卒以我軍勇氣百倍、銳不可當、下午三時半、寶山城廂敵軍、被我完全擊潰、向吳淞鎮逃竄、靑天白日滿地紅之國旗、仍然飄揚寶山城樓之上、此役我軍雖頗有損失、但敵軍傷亡之重、則遠在我軍一倍以上、</p>
<p>昨日吳淞方面主力戰、在三官堂城楊路地帶、我生力軍開抵前綫後、卽於上午七時許、分兩路進攻、一路由城楊路直取寶山、一路向同濟路推進反攻吳淞、我敵兩軍隊開始大激戰、一時砲火連天、殊為劇烈、迄至下午三時、城楊路敵軍敗退、我軍已抄越大廟逼近寶山城西門、同濟路陣綫未動、因該路敵軍勢重、不應輕入、但我軍冲殺、俱各奮力當先、不稍後退、尚相持於暮色蒼茫之中、泗塘河陣綫、昨日未有戰事、</p>
<p>寶山縣城、地處江濱、殊難防守、原非軍事要塞、但我駐兵壁壘堅固、敵雖一再增援、向我進犯、終未得手、待前日（四日）敵軍由城北沙龍口江岸偸渡登陸、凡四百餘人、利用海陸空三軍立體式的向我陣地猛撲、同時吳淞砲台灣之敵、亦向側面推進、我駐兵奮勇抵抗、百折不撓、雙方砲火猛烈、血戰肉搏、死傷俱重、前日（五日）下在敵又大批增援、傾全力來犯、向寶山縣城進攻、我軍憑險扼守、抵抗至烈、惟敵以砲艦及飛機猛烈轟炸、傷亡頗重、至昨晨止、我軍某部、在寶山城內、死守待援、自前晚至昨晨、我口師大批援軍、業已開到、已將敵軍四面堵住、擊潰敵軍、直指顧間事耳、</p>
<h3>獅子林昨砲戰甚烈</h3>
<p>中央社、停泊於淞口之敵艦、自昨晨以迄午後三時許、不斷開砲向我獅子林方面轟擊、我軍亦以重砲還擊、砲聲隆隆、聲震遐邇、</p>
<p>敵軍侵入寶山後、又企圖向獅子林及月浦方面進展、以解羅店之圍、同時希冀取得聯絡、故昨日敵軍全日以重砲向我軍陣地轟擊、掩護其部隊前進、獅子林方面、激戰最烈、直至昨晚、我軍仍堅守原地、月浦方面、我軍亦仍在奮勇迎戰中、</p>
<h3>瀏河全日激戰敵登陸企圖失敗</h3>
<p>敵援軍到滬後、分在各處登岸、瀏河方面、亦捲土重來、企圖登岸、我守軍卽奮起痛擊、敵一部份仍憑藉其砲火之掩護、向前進犯、猖獗萬分、雙方遂發生劇烈戰鬥、我軍沈着應戰、在密集砲火之下、卒將登陸進犯之敵擊退、</p>
<p>中央社、自昨晨拂曉起、敵艦集結於瀏河·小川沙·楊林口·及七鴉口等處、企圖登陸、我方戒備嚴密、一俟敵艦逼近、卽予痛擊、直至昨晚止、敵軍登陸企圖完全失敗、</p>
<p>瀏河方面之敵、前夜起又在猛烈砲火掩護之下、開始向我猛攻、藉以牽制我方兵力、企圖使羅店東北盛橋一帶被我包圍之敵、可以突圍而出、我軍沈着應戰、敵終不得逞、昨晨又有敵機多架、在太倉及嘉定一帶轟炸、被燬民房甚多、城內居民紛紛逃避</p>
<h3>楊林口敵被我擊退</h3>
<p>中央社蘇州六日電、六日晨一時許、有一部敵軍乘輪至楊林口七鴉口（在瀏河西北）一帶、企圖登陸、當卽被我駐軍擊退、</p>
<h3>我空軍異常活躍昨晚炸燬敵艦兩艘</h3>
<p>我轟炸機一隊、昨晚七時、飛往小川沙口外、轟炸停泊該處之敵艦、敵艦雖以高射砲密集射擊、然我空軍人員、勇敢異常、在砲火中投擲炸彈多枚、當有敵艦兩艘、着彈起火、全部焚燬、</p>
<p>中央社南京六日電、航界息、我空軍轟炸機一隊、於六日下午七時、飛往滬上轟炸停留羅店口外之敵艦、當我空軍已飛近敵艦上空時、敵方始發覺、急倉皇發砲、我軍在砲彈密集中、上下自如、投彈數十枚、當有敵方兩驅逐艦起火、稍頃、火熖愈烈、我軍見已完成任務、乃相偕安全返防、</p>
<h3>羅店等處陣綫鞏固</h3>
<p>據官方消息、羅店方面、於昨日上午十時之前、敵我曾有小接觸、八字橋方面、咋日平靜無戰事、浦東方面、昨日除敵艦曾一度砲擊外、亦無戰事、北站一帶、則僅敵機曾往轟炸而已、上述各地、我軍之陣綫、均無變動、</p>
<h3>敵登虬江碼頭附近沙灘我今晨可將其肅清</h3>
<p>中央社、昨日自晨迄午敵機不斷在軍工路引翔鄉市中心區及江灣一帶轟炸、連日在楊樹浦方面增援之敵、共達五六千人、卽在敵機掩護之下、向我軍工路及引翔鄉一帶陣地進攻、我軍奮勇抗戰、迄晚敵未得逞、同時敵艦二十餘艘、停泊虬江碼頭附近江面以密集之砲火向我轟擊、掩護敵軍由虬江碼頭登岸、我軍亦以密集之機槍掃射、抗拒敵軍登岸、相持至昨日午後、卒有一部之敵、強達虬江碼頭附近之沙灘、我軍正嚴密監視中、預定今晨可將其掃數肅清、</p>
<h3>敵艦又轟閘北浦東</h3>
<p>中央社、敵艦二日猛攻浦東我軍陣地、掩護登陸、當被我擊退、敵以所圖未逞、沉寂兩日、經補充彈藥後、前午夜又向北站方面猛攻、我××方面之野砲隊、亦開砲還擊、互轟約一小時許始息、乃至昨晨五時許、敵驅逐艦一艘、又向我浦東轟擊、砲火甚密、全市震動、我方亦予還擊、並令前哨將士嚴密警戒、防止敵人偷渡、敵計不售、約七時、砲聲始停、</p>
<h3>續有敵艦運到援軍</h3>
<p>中央社、前晚及昨晨續有敵運輸艦一艘、及商輪三艘、駛入浦江、運輸艦停靠招商北棧、商輪三艘則一艘停靠大阪碼頭、二艘停靠黃浦碼頭、除有一部敵軍登岸外、各該敵輪敵艦皆在起卸彈藥草包、及其他軍需品、甚為繁忙、黃浦碼頭並有敵大量重砲卸下、其砲筒長近二丈、口徑之大、可以想見、</p>
<h3>出雲艦仍駛回浦江</h3>
<p>敵第三艦隊司令艦出雲號、於前晚駛泊淞口、策劃並指揮敵艦作戰方略後、於昨日下午零時十五分、始駛回浦江、仍泊公和祥碼頭對過二號浮筒、</p>
<h3>浦江敵艦昨僅十艘</h3>
<p>自敵方最近增援之二師團及大批彈械、由敵艦四十九艘運滬後、除大部集結口外、企圖登陸、增援吳淞瀏河一帶敵軍外、同時並有一部駛入浦江、增援楊樹浦及虹口之敵軍、前昨二日、該批援軍及彈藥、業已分批起卸完竣、而前日浦江敵艦尚有甘一艘、昨日則僅剩十艘、蓋敵艦之大部、現皆集結吳淞口獅子林及瀏河一帶、作掩護敵軍再度進犯之用、茲將昨日下午浦江各敵艦停泊情形、調査如下、卅五號廿三號七號及十一號浮筒砲艦各一艘、十號七號浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、二號浮筒出雲旗艦一艘、日本郵船碼頭第廿一隊驅逐艦一艘、三菱碼頭第十六隊驅逐艦一艘、招商局中棧第一六○號運輪艦一艘、共計十艘、</p>
<h3>敵機連日轟炸楊行</h3>
<p>三日上午十時許、敵機六架、飛翔於楊行鎮上空、時該鎭東市張家橋積糓倉、正臨時救急、開倉平糶、居民往糶者頗衆、致被敵機察覺、疑有軍事行為、遂投下炸彈七八枚、當卽炸死無吿居民二十餘人、受傷十餘人、日軍手段之毒辣、可見一般、次日（四日）午後三時、復有敵機十餘架、前往投彈轟炸、竟將該鎮倪行橋迤西至孫家橋一段最熱鬧市街、完全炸燬、死傷二三十人、慘狀可悲、昨（五日）晨又有敵機六架、飛抵該鎮投彈、因標的不準、彈均然於鎮後田野間、惟有一彈落於西市梢娘娘廟附近、炸毀廟屋一角、未有死傷、</p>
<h3>敵機昨又轟炸滬西</h3>
<p>中央社云、昨晨七時許、敵機又出現於滬西北新涇一帶上空、在庇亞士路投下一彈、其時有由北新涇逃往租界之難民、行經該處、以致被炸斃六人、傷二人、</p>
<p>昨日上午八時許、敵機六架、在滬西陳家渡上空盤旋偵察後、投彈二枚、旋卽向東飛去、</p>
<p>昨晨七時半、敵機四架、在虹橋區內及租界西北面之京滬鐵路上空投彈、一時半至二時間、敵機在市中心南面、滬西聖約翰大學以北鐵路線處及遠東跑馬塲附近轟炸</p>
<h3>日報對我勇士欽佩</h3>
<p>上月十七日、我機三架飛往轟炸北四川路底之敵陸戰隊司令部、當時敵方以高射砲密集射擊、不幸我機一架被擊受傷、航空員閻海文君、立卽使用降落傘下落、詎意仍墮於敵軍陣地、敵軍立將閻君包圍、閻君卽出手槍向敵射擊、當擊斃數人、至最後一粒子彈、向太陽穴自擊殉國、此壯烈犧性之史實、日本各報、均以大字刊載、昨日此間收到八月三十一日之大阪每日新聞、亦以長篇之通信、載述此事、並對此壯烈犧牲之勇士深致欽佩、</p>
<h3>虹口昨日頻吿火警</h3>
<p>昨晨八時虹口救火會西北面、有一處起火、其勢頗烈、華德路西牢以北之大火、至九時尚未熄滅、正午至二時間、虹口救火會附近有兩處起火、下午三時二十分、虹口救火會附近（卽公共停屍所相近）有火警一起、</p>
<h3>日軍部發現重大危機在鄉軍人之沒落</h3>
<p>不願作戰多投井自殺勉　强入伍又涕泗交流</p>
<p>東京訊、日本本有常備兵二十餘萬、後備兵二百萬、現因積極侵華、已將常備兵改編成四十一師團、惟二百萬之後備兵、則全國壯丁、搜羅已盡、無法擴充矣、但最近日本軍部、忽發見一重大危機、卽軍部所持為軍隊後援之在鄉軍人、其腐敗情形、實足以使軍部起大恐慌、按此輩在鄉軍人、為數甚多、平日藉軍閥餘威、魚肉鄉里、人民皆敢怒而不敢言、自蘆溝橋事件發生以來、更神氣活現、各處街頭巷尾、皆可見在鄉軍人之張牙舞爪、不意此次軍部擴充軍隊時、此等在鄉軍人、竟有若干不能應召而至、甚至有杳無着落者、軍部至為驚駭、現尚束手無策、更有一部分在鄉軍人、在入伍之時、親友送往車站、往往有對親友流淚者、亦有在鄉軍人不願作戰而投井自盡者、於八月二十二日、在東京大森區、為憲兵司令部捕去在鄉軍人赤池常雄等三人、其犯罪情形、更足證大和魂之破産、蓋以軍事機密、出售於某國大使館也、因之、日本之在鄉軍人一百餘萬、其中有若干腐敗分子、彼軍部目下尚以為眞相未洩露也、</p>
<h3>字林西報痛斥廣田演說</h3>
<p>此種似是而非言論　决不能欺騙全世界　散播排日者卽日本之自身</p>
<p>字林西報昨載短評、題曰“局部的解决”、謂日外相廣田之演說、以上海目前之危機、歸咎於中國政府拒絕服從日本之力謀成立局部解决、此種似是而非之辯論、雖可使彼想像以為接受日本之主張可以免去甚大之損失與夫痛苦者之胸中發生及響、然不能欺騙世界也、日本之求區域或局部解决也、不特與其莊嚴表示認南京政府為中國中央政府之志願相反、且使中國陷入難關、不得不屈服日本、任令零碎割佔中國土地、而對於此種手段之結局、亳不能獲有保障、假使中央政府屈服日本之條件、而將因蘆溝橋發生之爭案作局部解决、則衆必責其所發抵抗任何繼續侵略中國土地之質言、乃屬虛偽、因是就政治與軍事而論、在何地抵抗最為合宜之問題、遂發生矣、其擇定上海區域也、雖如廣田所言、爲對一二八上海休戰協定之顯然違背、第日本在華北侵略之事實、與東京政府對中國在該方抵抗侵略所持之態度、已使些微出入、無關大要、而有一事亦須記憶者、該協定下所設保障忠實遵守之機構、迄未用及、僅日本欲掩蔽其意志明白之運動時、欲援引該協定之條款、而當然不能激起他人之熱誠、尤其因日人在該協定簽字後、卽在虹口與楊樹浦恣睢狂行、絕不遵守該協定之精神、至於遵守文字、更不必言矣、廣田力圖利用上海之兵燹、而歸咎於中國當局、但廣田絕不悟彼非在一九三二年發言也、當時流利的辯詞、大可激動人心、而今日則大異於昔、蓋全世界皆能察知日本軍閥加於中國政治全體嚴酷之壓力也、例如廣田抨擊中政府實行極惡之排日運動時、不幸其所撾之鼓、鼓上裂一巨洞、致不能發出動聽之聲、要知中國排日情感之最有效力的散播者、卽為日本黷武主義之本身、與夫依時並失時狂悖宣布黷武主義之意志之善於詞令的日本發言人也、</p>

<p>时評</p>
<h3>與敵人進行“封鎖”戰</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從敵人侵我淞滬。歷時旬餘。未能得手。乃於上月二十五日。由第三艦隊宣布封鎖我南部海岸。從我江蘇北部到廣東汕頭。所有我國的商船航行。敵方都準備加以襲擊。這封鎖辦法施行了旬日。對我未見絲毫影響而敵軍在吳淞瀏河一帶的盲衝猛撞也仍舊沒有任何的進展於是敵方海軍省又宣布從本月五日起。封鎖我東南的全部海岸。這一步驟的實行。在一方面固然表示蠻橫狠毒的敵人。對我的侵略手段。已是無所不用其極。但另一方面則又顯出敵人雖然兇惡剛强而在兩旬以來的戰爭中。實已“黔驢技窮。”它的宣布封鎖我全部海岸只是無可奈何的一種威脅手段而已。</p>
<p>就國際法看來。敵人此次對我侵略。並沒有正式宣布戰爭。要實行封鎖我海岸。與國際公法的常則。完全是相背的。不過以日帝國主義的兇暴無理。根本上不能與它計較法理。我們對於日帝國主義這個荒謬行動。只有從兩個要點。加以考慮。卽第一·它的封鎖我全部海岸。對我是否會有何種損害。第二·敵人這種威脅行爲我們應該怎樣的加以對付。</p>
<p>在軍事上。海岸封鎖的施行。主要有兩種目的。第一是在海軍作戰中間。把敵人的艦隊封鎖於某一地帶。消滅其戰鬥能力。第二是在海洋的航道上。截斷敵人的商船往來。以達到摧毁敵人對外貿易及阻止敵人外來接濟的目的。不過在施行這種封鎖的中間常包含有很大的危險卽影響到第三者中立國的利益。像上次世界大戰中德國不顧一切的施行海上封鎖。擊沉美國商船多艘。終於使維持中立的美國。加入協約國方面。使德帝國主義陷於慘敗。</p>
<p>我們從上述海岸封鎖的兩種目的來觀察這次日帝國主義對我封鎖的影響。第一·我國沒有海軍。我們對於日帝國主義的戰爭。主要爲陸戰及空戰。所以封鎖我海軍的目的。根本上是談不到的。第二·我國雖有小部分的沿海商航。但因爲我們向來沒有海外投資。又不須依賴海外市塲。敵人欲斷絕我對外的商運往來。結果却又是完全落空。實際上。在近年來。隨着敵人軍艦的來往我沿海。深入我腹地。有種種的私貨貿易。毒品販賣。使我的關稅門戶。全被破壞。無數平民。受到毒害。現在戰爭一經展開。加以敵人的宣布封鎖。反使這種破壞我經濟。毁損我國力的勾當。一舉廓淸。從這種情形看來。敵人的封鎖我海岸。非但於我無損。且有某種利益。而敵人在對我封鎖時期。造成第三者的損失。招致中立國的反對更是對我重大有利之點。</p>
<p>不過在敵人業已宣布封鎖我海岸之後它將在我沿海各地濫施暴行也是意想中的事情。對於敵人這種野蠻手段。我們自當給以有力的對付。最簡截的。在敵人對我沿海施行威脅的時候我們當以堅强的防禦給與有力的回擊同時敵人在我海岸的野蠻暴行。我們更當以迅速的暴露。昭告全世界。我們相信。在最近美國海員發動、拒運貨品往日的表示中可知全世界海上勞動者對我的深厚同情。是日帝國主義所無法想望的。在世界各友邦的海員之外。我們散佈於世界各處。特別是太平洋沿岸的僑胞。也將爲對日發動“反封鎖”的一個偉大力量。近年來日貨傾銷南洋。據說華僑亦爲重要的買主。血日本商輪行駛各處海洋。都有我僑胞充當水手。自今以後。我們僑胞當以堅决的行動。實行封鎖。使敵人的海外貿易與商運。受到致命的打擊。我們將使敵人得到一個敎訓。卽他們的封鎖對我不足有何種損失而我們的廣大封鎖却能擊中敵人眞正的弱點。</p>
<h3>日飛機擊傷英大使案</h3>
<p>英要求迅速答覆</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國駐華大使許閣森遭日本飛機攻擊受傷一事、外交界人士頃宣稱、英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士曾與日本廣田外相舉行談話數次、請其注意必須迅速答覆、惟東京方面所傳消息、謂日本政府已以覆交草案、遞交克萊琪爵士、則外交界人士並未加以徵實、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［東京］日外相廣田今日在國會中言及英國駐華大使許閣森被擊事、謂迄今尚未有明白證據、可證明英大使乘車爲日機所攻擊、渠確信日本軍隊决不故意攻擊非戰鬥員云、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國駐華大使許閣森爵士被日本飛機擊傷一案、工黨每日民聲報頃載稱、英國前於上月二十八日向日本政府所提出之照會、日本在本月八日之前若不提出復文、英國政府卽當考慮他項應付辦法、例如立卽召回駐日新任大使克萊琪爵士、英國政府並已通知日本、謂此項照會甚盼及早答復、屆時日本若將日本空軍人員所負責任、予以推諉、决非英國所能認可云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］“星期快報”預料、關於英駐華大使許閣森爵士被擊傷之抗議照會所載要求三項、日本如拒絕其中任何一項要求、則英國將重行提出抗議、又稱、日本對於新照會、倘依然不加注意、則英日外交關係將暫時中斷、該報繼稱、星期三之內閣會議、將討論保護英國在華利益之辦法云、（五日海通電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］每日電聞報頃評論中日兩國戰爭、略謂、日本能否迅速克服中國、或與中國成立妥協、殊屬疑問、中日戰事若果曠日持久、日本在財政上定必引起種種困難、所望兩國仍能眞誠合作、“日木原以爲對華戰事、必可迅速結束、中國軍隊卽使抵抗、亦必不難立卽予以掃蕩、但此種估計、顯屬不確”云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>地中海會議當有劇烈辯論</h3>
<p>本月十日在瑞士開幕　德意兩國均被邀出席</p>
<p>［巴黎］據可靠消息、地中海會議將於九月十日在瑞士尼洪地方舉行、其地在日內瓦與洛桑之間、法國報紙預料開會時將有劇烈之辯論及驚人之發展、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］按之官方消息、英法兩國政府已於本日晚間正式邀請意·德·蘇聯·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·阿爾巴尼亞·保加利亞·土耳其·埃及·希臘十國、派遣代表出席地中海安全會議、其中德國因參加西班牙·國海面監察辦法、又蘇聯·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞三國、（卽黑海沿岸各國、）因對於地中海航運有極重要關係故均邀其參加、至於西班牙內戰當事雙方、則並未被邀、據一般所知、英法兩國均認爲地中海各國船舶安全問題、極須予以解决、倘能在國聯會大會開會（九月十三日）之前、覓獲解决辦法、自屬最佳、以故地中海會議將於本月十日開始舉行、英法兩國政府現正賡續進行磋商、以便擬定議事日程云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］般人預料意國將接受參加地中海會議、意國報紙最初對於法國所提召集地中海沿岸各國會議之計劃、加以猛烈之批評、其後聞悉英國積極參加地中海會議議程之編製始乃停止攻擊、各報均謂地中海會議已决定不在日內瓦舉行、而意德兩國亦被邀參加會議、此兩事足證法國原定計劃及其反對義國之舉動、已遭失敗、目前各報僅詆責地中海會議、謂其與西班牙內亂不干涉辦法調整委員會實相重複云（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］地中海會議擬於本月十日在瑞士尼洪鎭開會、頃據外交部人士宣稱、德國政府尚未接得邀請書、倘接得邀請書之後、亦不至立即向英國政府提出答復、則以德國政界領袖人物、現均在紐倫堡、參加國社黨常年大會故也、外交部人士並以爲、關於地中海會議問題、德國政府自賞與意國政府密切合作、致行動抑德國官塲方面、曾迭次說明其對於地中海船舶被擊事件之觀點、當德國巡洋艦萊浦齊號被西班牙政府軍轟擊之後、德國政府曾提出抗議及各項建議、彼時英法兩國倘能考慮及之、則目前地中海各國會議、或將成爲多餘之舉矣云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯）</p>

<h3>敵機今又轟炸閘北</h3>
<p>中央社云、今晨七時許、敵機十餘架、在滬市天空盤旋達二小時許、先在滬南一帶、結成一大隊、窺察甚久、旋分成若干小隊、在閘北浦東滬西等處投彈轟炸、閘北區投彈尤多、并用機槍掃射、我駐軍以高射砲及高射機關鎗射擊、敵機始行逸去、</p>
<p>中央社云、敵機三架　於今晨十時左右、在北新涇一帶投彈轟炸、其中一彈落於庇亞士路附近爆炸、死平民八人、傷二人、其他無甚損失云、</p>
<h3>出雲又開至吳淞口</h3>
<p>上午不時砲轟我軍陣地</p>
<p>敵旗艦出雲號、昨晨開往吳淞、指揮各艦、向我獅子林等處開放排砲、企圖援軍在各處登陸、至晚該艦仍退回浦江、今晨又複從浦江第二號浮筒開赴吳淞、在楊樹浦以下一帶之敵艦、隨同開赴下游者亦有三數艘、砲轟我軍各處陣地、藉使績到之援軍、乘機向瀏河等處掩護上陸之敵兵、我軍正在抗戰中、現外白渡橋三菱碼頭停驅逐艦一艘、公和祥碼頭前停敵巡洋艦一艘、中棧停敵運輪艦一艘、</p>
<h3>虹口敵軍佈防情形</h3>
<p>對行人一概禁止來往</p>
<p>大公社云、虹口區敵軍、自增援後、現悉其大部集中於北四川路四六五號日本小學、吳淞路海寗路口上海銀行株式會社、狄思威路二四七號日陸軍武官室、海寗路威利大戲院、密勒路四百號海軍俱樂部、東江灣路十號日軍司令部、及黃陸路海軍醫院等地、至其餘部隊則分別佈防於通衢要道、及沿各馬路較堅固之建築物屋頂、負嵎防守、同時該項敵軍大多躲避於各弄里內、故表面上殊鮮見敵軍踪跡、此外海寗路之豐陽館、乍浦路之常盤館、亦均為日浪人及便衣隊佔為總部、作策劃一切搗亂工作之用云、</p>
<p>又訊、據某西報記者云、虹口區自百老匯路起、至虹口一帶止、現日軍已禁止任何第三國人士往來、號持有日領事館方面之通行證者、亦不能例外、故該地一帶現已與祖界處於隔絕中、至日軍此舉動機、聞因佈置軍事關係、恐被外人覩見云、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>日軍閥天天在其國內。宣傳對華用兵。怎樣勝利。怎樣大捷。但據確息。日本近調五師來援。號稱最精銳之御林軍近衛師團。亦奉調來滬。倘使果然勝利。何必更調大軍來援。其說可不攻自破。</p>
<p>據由日來華之某外人談。每當日軍開㧞來華時。各軍人家屬。均扶老携幼相送。哭聲震天。此種情形。我們同情之滬。不禁為之奪眶而出。不知日軍閥聞之。當作若何感想。</p>
<p>又據被俘之穉齡幼童言。因見報載。倘赴上海服務。有冰淇林汽水可吃。不料到滬後。卽赴前綫作戰。與報上所載。完全不符。冰淇林汽水之害人如此。殊屬可歏。而冰淇林汽水之效用若此。亦至足驚人。</p>

<h3>第二次歐戰快要爆發麽(下)</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>㊁德國可要利用這千載一時的良機？</p>
<p>一位南美洲的德國僑民貧向人訴冤，諾貝爾的和平獎金不給希特勒，是一件人間的不平事．兩三年來希特勒於重整軍備以後，事實上曾作過多次的和平演講。一位美國記者說也許人家不相信希特勒願意和平，不過希特勒本人說慌了口漸漸自己反而相信起來。希特勒要戰爭嗎？這個答案不很容易。國社黨中人屢次聲明，他們不願再見流血的悲慘，但無論如何他們却要收回德國原有的殖民地。收回殖民地可以用和平的方法，這個是歷史上空前所未見的例外！</p>
<p>我們不管希特勒本人喜歡和平也好，戰爭也好，但他此日掌握了第二次歐戰的鎖鑰，却是一種事實。國社黨人希望一個强盛德國，照他們的計劃看來，對於目前德國的境界似乎不會有滿意的理由。不經過一次戰爭，就會逹到他們的目的，大數國社黨人不至於有這種便宜的奢望。㯫軍事專家的估計，德國的全部軍備計劃目前已實規了十之六七。也許還要一二年時間的準備，才有東西兩個戰綫作戰的實力。可是德國能够久待嗎？一二年中的變化如何，誰能够預料？并且英國此日又在加緊它的軍備。德國不願利用這千載一時的良機？</p>
<p>▲英國的軍備已可以應付急變？據一位熟悉西歐政局的某國外交家口述，他由可靠方面得到的消息。英國政府此次會乘英王加冕典禮機會，特別招待了德國的觀禮特使，國防部部長白倫堡上將，參觀了英國各地的海陸空軍新式設備。白倫堡上將看了以後，張開口說不出話來。為了此事他曾訓斥過德國駐英大使館的武官辦事不力，平日的報告與英國軍備的實際情形相去太遠。白倫堡上將會對人表示，就他此次所看到的東西，已經夠了。他從來沒有想到，英國軍備擴充的程度會怎麽迅速！</p>
<p>有幾家英國報紙怪英國軍事當局冒昧，把自己軍備的秘密，公開給未來的敵人看。但一般外交界中人却認為英國政府這種舉動十分聰明，最少在第二次歐戰要爆發時，白倫堡上將總得自己先考慮一下，可以不可以冒這個險。因為他是一個軍事專家，他知道新式軍械的作用。不過少數人又覺得，這多少仍帶點危險性。英國的全部軍備目前還沒有完成，也許德國明瞭了英國的實力以後，知道此時不發動，等英國專佈置一二年，將來把握更少·說不定反而會促成第二次歐戰的爆發更加迅速！又何况，目前西班牙事件愈迫愈緊，德國借題發揮的機會正多，德國會不會立刻去利用這個良機？這是大家所担心的。</p>
<p>英德两國目前大家正在討價還價。也許戰禍可以避免，假如英國所出的代價能够使德國人滿意的話否則在德國人看來，這個千載一時的機會决不應輕易放過的。倘若這時候發生了戰事，最少，還可以以空軍的力量迫英國嚴守中立。雖說，德國此時動手已經算是一種冒險。因為德國人也知道英國遲早總會加入敵人那　面去的。</p>
<p>▲紅軍的戰鬥力怎樣　新近蘇淸黨案件是一個謎，大家都要知道那到底是什麼　回事，可是沒有一個人能够答復，甚至於各國駐俄的外交官並新聞記者，說是紅軍中八位高級將領眞的同希特勒有勾結，這似乎說不過去，因為我們想像不出希特勒，墨索利尼的親信會勾結斯太林來反對他們的首領，說是沒有這回事嗎？那末新近捷克自己焦急起來，會更改全部國防計劃，（據說，原有的計劃被紅軍杜卡策夫斯基上將洩漏給德國），並且此事發生後，法俄的關係好像又比從前更加密切。</p>
<p>據部分人猜測，蘇俄此次淸黨，淸軍是兩回事，雖說，托洛斯基與杜卡策夫斯基間有個共同點，是反對斯太林，杜卡策夫斯基上將，索來被人家推崇為蘇俄的拿破侖，也許有政治的野心，但要說他“賣國求榮”，把蘇俄的國土割讓與德國，那又不見得是一宗事實，大約他以軍事專家的看法，於是乎與斯太林的政策發生衝突，這裹我們要記起，蘇俄紅軍與德國軍部的關係，有了十六七年左右的歷史，假如不是希特勒登臺，那末兩國間軍事同盟的可能性極大，（由地理上，戰略上看來，德國需要蘇俄帮助，收回它東部的失地，同樣的，蘇俄也有許多國土被波蘭，羅馬尼亞佔去，（兩國對於東歐目前的國境分配法不滿，是一宗事實，）年來斯太林的聯法政策發與紅軍原有的國防計劃自然要發生衝突，或因此遂引起了此次的事變，</p>
<p>杜卡策夫斯基上將等死後，紅軍幹部已加以改組，以人才來論，紅軍實力自然要受一種影響，假如他生前是主張聯德（不是希特勒）的一個人，那末此後紅軍與德國的聯絡，即將中斷，德國參謀本部從此眞的要把蘇俄算做是一位主要的敵國，（記得去年德俄雙方互相攻擊激烈的時候，英國外相艾登曾說過，兩國的政治家盡管咒罵，但兩國的軍人仍暗談合作問題，他這句話並不是沒有根據的，）</p>
<p>目前的問題是，德國會不會乘紅軍變動組織的時候先發制人？</p>
<p>本年秋收過後，也許希特勒會給我們個答案。</p>
<h3>抗戰中救護事業底一個斷面</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>這次華北戰事發生、京周奔走京滬廬山間、曾對救護事業做過幾次的演講、發表過三四篇的文字，並且播過一兩次的音、有所報告、有所論列、而所得效果、似乎不免聽置藐藐、後來虹橋事件發生了、紅十字會曾經用巨幅廣告徵求人材物品、以為準備、不過所得捐款、未足一千投效的人、絕無專材、這種情形、雖然不敢說滬人士確有滬諺“不見棺材不哭”的脾氣但是事實如此、不能不使京周痛心、上海砲火喧天了、許多熱心愛國的人士、方始在倉皇間、來扶助職司救護、了無實力的紅會、以應付當前這樣大的難關、同人埋頭苦幹、一方而因為工作緊張、無暇宣傳、也無席宣傳另一方面　也因為受軍部約束、（見八月二十七日紅會通告）對於華洋雜處的上海社會不應透露和軍情有關的消息、所以工作情形、對社會絕少報告、初不料海上人士仍以未能免俗喜事宣揚、竟因紅會工作的秘而不宣、對紅會加以莫大的懷疑、就是協作團體、也不免漸加責難、現在作者便受了這種環境的驅使不得不選擇一些可以向國人披露的工作經過、陳告一下、希望國人——尤其是上海人士——多多指導贊助、俾便集思廣益、共策進行、</p>
<p>一、抗戰准傭中的全國救護準備</p>
<p>去年中央因為日人對華情勢惡化、國防日益吃緊、早就頒布了個非常區域救護事業辦法大綱、指定某某十幾個省市　為非常區域、令由黨政機關參加指導、當地紅十字會分會、醫藥團體醫事敎育機關　商會、和其他與救護工作有關各團體、組設救護委員會、附設相當的救護機關、從事編練儲備、準備辦理軍民區時救護工作、在由衛生署和中國紅十字會總會派員、並聯絡軍醫署、和其地與救護工作有關各機關團體、在中央設置救護事業總管理處、以便指揮調度、期收指臂相使之效、紅十字總會除通令全國各分會參加組織、加緊準備外、並聯絡總管理處和各界專門人員、特設救護委員會、設計協助供應、支配、訓練、各事宜、</p>
<p>迄平津危急、沿江沿海一帶要隘、隨在有戰事爆發之可虞、紅會救護委會和總管理處、便切實妥籌款項預計暫以五萬受傷病人，可用五個月為度、購置藥械、一面呈山敎部衛署先後會令各省市查辦醫藥人員、各醫藥院校速組救護隊、準備組織二十個救護大隊、候命編發所購藥械、撥總數三分之一、分區存儲某某六個比較安全的場處、餘即供戰區使用、各院校遵組救護隊者、除同濟·齊魯·先已受軍醫署委託、組織手術組、準備參加軍傷醫院工作、東南同德·準備留滬服務外　計有上海醫學院二隊、中央·湘雅·中山·華西·光華·南通·河南·廣西諸醫學院·和贛專·浙專·魯專·藥專各隊、此外、河北省立醫學院、以院長爲紅會華北救護委員會副主席早受紅會囑託、編組手術組　隊、在保定帶服務、管理處並酌發藥機、令緩蒙衛生院組設一隊、相機出發、其他地方衛生機關自動組設救護隊者、有吳與二隊、自告奮勇準備待命出動者、有甘庸衛生處、海鹽縣立醫院兩處、又威海衛兩醫院同人、灘縣基督敎醫院同人、中華護士會護十數百人、滄縣博施醫院男護士全體同人、亦會向管理處自請候命參加救護工作、</p>
<p>二、華北的戰區救護</p>
<p>紅會自綏遠抗戰事起　即在平組設華北救護委員會、以便就近策動救護工作、這次七七事變、華北委員會於倉卒間籌劃布置也盡過相當的努力、平津失陷後、除促華北護委會駐保人員、就河北省立醫學院抽組手術組、令清苑分會協力合作、以應急需、並即派中大和中央醫院合組之救護隊、赴平漢綫隨某軍服務外、並添請齊魯大學所組之一隊、即開赴津浦綫某地協助軍醫担任救護、一面令小站武淸滄緊·蠡縣·任邱·僥陽·獻縣·各分會查報地方情形準備救護不同時青島·滄緊·宣化·洛陽·定興·惠民·各分會、也都自動函告、已積極準備、宣化方面請款補助、並經准予撥發定興獻縣、並都請發藥機、準備辦理後方醫院、併力協助、詳情俟得報後、當再陳告只是南口·張垣·商都·各方面紅會織下的救護工作、因爲種種阻礙、尚付闕如、僅由軍醫自行救護、是我們覺得最感不安的、</p>
<p>三、淞滬戰區救護</p>

<p>京周不敏、追隨紅會詣公、助理會務、凡所措施、大概已如上述周口是示、物力是資、端賴時賢、惟京周於此、也有幾點、要希望我各界和醫界愛國諸公鑒奪的、請順便把牠寫在下面、做我這段文字的一個結尾、</p>
<p>㊀這次上海市救護工作、把幾天的預備工作、應付這般大的戰局、運輸工具並且這般缺乏、根本不能相稱、自然不容易辦得滿意、</p>
<p>㊁在長期抗戰歷程中、上海根本不是後方、上海救護醫院的所以能這樣蜂起雲湧、都尺爲上海醫界的人材和器械較多、辦理比較客易一些、但是長期抗戰下去、傷兵是否可以永遠移尊就敎、到上海來求醫、還是或許要由醫師們屈駕赴後方處理、這是京周所要請我醫界同人詳加考慮的、</p>
<p>㊂在長期抗戰中辦救護醫院、應有一定的水準（中央會有規定）要旨是在能撙節物力準備持久、在水準以下社會人士固然應寓加以裁制、但必欲辦到水準之上、似亦母須提倡、京周以爲大家爲國家服務、應先存一無我之念、他日旣不希望論功行賞、那末現在殊可不必爭奇鬥異、假如他處醫生用客觀眼光、目我上海的醫生爲‘海派’怕也不是諸公所樂聞的啦、</p>
<p>㊃在特區裏辦醫院、和在戰綫上救護傷兵、是截然不同的兩樁事情希望辦醫院的、能體認到從前綫救回一個傷兵、是很不容易的、對入院傷兵的留院施治、幸勿加以選揮不論輕傷重傷苟可留治、務必視同仁地留下施治、</p>
<p>㊄因爲社會上一般人的不知尊重紅會、往往把紅會旗幟、作不正富的用途、所以特區當局、對傷兵的出入、時時發生很大的周折、現在紅會對章幟的使用、已有嚴密的規定並已分別知照軍事和特區富局、希望社會人士、對紅會章幟、也嚴密監視、帮同杜絕朦混、以利工作、</p>
<p>㊅滬戰救護工作爲財力所限、對於熱心投效的青年、尤其是對於受過敎護訓練的學員、未能盡量羅致、很是歉仄、但是所以未能通函錄用的原因、也不少是因爲諸位底住址改變、或是原通訊處尸陷入戰區的此點應請多多鑒原、大家勿因失望而發生反感、是所至禱、</p>
<p>㊆現在有許多人士、很想到救護醫院裹去慰勞傷兵、紅會各救藥醫院和特約醫院、鑒於上海華產雜處、同時必須遵守軍警命令、門禁不得不稍關緊、因此却一律謝絕慰勞、開罪之處、知所不免、併祈各界多多鑒諒、</p>

<h3>Our Brave and Elite Troops Counterattacked Baoshan with Bloodshed, Enemy Forces Completely Defeated</h3>
<p>The remaining enemy forces fled to Wusong in utter disarray. Fierce artillery battles occurred in the Shizilin area yesterday. Our air force warriors shot down two enemy warships. The enemy's attempt to land at Liuhe failed.</p>
<p>After the enemy's Second Division was reinforced in Shanghai for several days, it launched a full-scale invasion of our Baoshan County. Our army, in order to preserve its strength, retreated slightly. However, one battalion of our army remained in the city to await reinforcements. Yesterday morning, our elite reinforcements arrived and ordered a full-scale counterattack, launching the fiercest battle since the start of the Shanghai war. Our troops advanced without retreat, displaying ten thousand times their usual courage, engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy also resisted stubbornly. We gradually advanced, and by 3:30 PM, the enemy forces in Baoshan City were completely defeated by us and fled towards Wusong Town. Our army pursued the victory, leaving enemy corpses strewn across the field. The dignified national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth was once again flying over the Baoshan city tower. The people cheered along the streets, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic scene. It was truly our army's most glorious victory since the start of the Shanghai war. As for the Shizilin area, dozens of enemy warships gathered and continuously bombarded our positions, also covering the advance of enemy troops fleeing from Baoshan in another direction, attempting to spy on Yuepu Town. They have already been repelled by our army. As of 3:00 AM this morning, there were no changes to our Yuepu-Luodian front line. As for the Yangshupu area, enemy troops landed on the beach at the Qiujiang Wharf, attempting to connect with the remaining enemy forces at Zhanghuabang. Our army is closely monitoring and will soon eliminate them. In the Jiangwan-Zhabei area, there was only artillery fire between the two sides, and they are currently still facing off on their original front lines.</p>
<h3>Our Elite Troops Fiercely Counterattacked, Baoshan City Completely Relieved</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Previous reports indicated that Baoshan County had fallen. It is now known that one battalion of our army remained in the city to await reinforcements, refusing to retreat, and fought a bloody battle with the enemy all night. As of 10:00 AM yesterday morning, they were still engaged in combat. The enemy had dispatched a force the night before, bypassing Baoshan City and advancing towards our Shizilin and Yuepu lines. At the same time, our reinforced elite troops arrived and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy forces suffered extremely heavy casualties and collapsed in retreat. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued fiercely. By yesterday morning, they had advanced to Sanguantang, three miles from Baoshan. At this time, enemy reinforcements arrived, and another fierce battle ensued. Our army surged forward like a tide, advancing with reckless abandon. The sounds of battle cries shook the heavens and the earth. By around 1:00 PM, they were even closer to the city suburbs, only one mile away. The enemy forces continued to fight like cornered beasts. Finally, with our army's hundredfold courage and irresistible momentum, at 3:30 PM, the enemy forces in Baoshan City were completely defeated and fled towards Wusong Town. The national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth is still flying above the Baoshan city tower. Although our army suffered considerable losses in this battle, the enemy's casualties were far more than double those of our army.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the main battle in the Wusong area was in the Sanguantang-Chengyang Road area. After our fresh troops arrived at the front line, they launched a two-pronged attack at around 7:00 AM, one route taking Chengyang Road directly to Baoshan, and the other advancing towards Tongji Road to counterattack Wusong. The two armies began a fierce battle, with artillery fire filling the sky, making it extremely intense. By 3:00 PM, the enemy forces on Chengyang Road had been defeated, and our army had bypassed the Great Temple and approached the west gate of Baoshan City. The Tongji Road front line remained unchanged because the enemy forces on that road were strong, and it was not advisable to enter lightly. However, our troops charged and fought bravely, each striving to be the first, without any retreat, and continued to fight into the twilight. There was no fighting on the Sitang River front line yesterday.</p>
<p>Baoshan County, located on the riverside, is extremely difficult to defend and was originally not a military stronghold. However, our garrison had solid fortifications, and although the enemy repeatedly reinforced their forces and attacked us, they ultimately did not succeed. It was not until the day before yesterday (the 4th) that enemy troops secretly crossed the riverbank at Shalongkou north of the city and landed, numbering over 400. They used a three-dimensional approach of sea, land, and air forces to attack our positions. At the same time, the enemy at the Wusong Paotaiwan also advanced from the side. Our garrison fought bravely, persevering despite numerous setbacks. Both sides engaged in fierce artillery fire and bloody hand-to-hand combat, suffering heavy casualties. The day before yesterday (the 5th), the enemy again sent a large number of reinforcements, launching a full-scale attack and advancing on Baoshan County. Our army held the dangerous terrain, resisting fiercely. However, the enemy used gunboats and airplanes to bombard fiercely, causing considerable casualties. As of yesterday morning, a unit of our army was defending Baoshan City, awaiting reinforcements. From the night before last until yesterday morning, a large number of our division's reinforcements had arrived, completely blocking the enemy forces on all sides. Defeating the enemy forces and heading straight for Gujian is imminent.</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battle at Shizilin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Enemy warships anchored at the Songkou (Wusong Mouth) continuously bombarded our Shizilin area from yesterday morning until around 3:00 PM. Our army also returned fire with heavy artillery, with the sound of cannons resounding far and wide.</p>
<p>After the enemy forces invaded Baoshan, they attempted to advance towards Shizilin and Yuepu to relieve the siege of Luodian and also hoping to make contact. Therefore, yesterday, the enemy forces bombarded our army's positions all day with heavy artillery, covering their troops' advance. The fighting was fiercest in the Shizilin area. Until last night, our army was still holding its ground. In the Yuepu area, our army was also still fighting bravely.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Liuhe All Day, Enemy Landing Attempt Failed</h3>
<p>After enemy reinforcements arrived in Shanghai, they landed in various places. In the Liuhe area, they also made a comeback, attempting to land. Our defending troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack. Some of the enemy forces, still relying on the cover of their artillery fire, advanced, acting extremely recklessly. The two sides then engaged in a fierce battle. Our army responded calmly, and under intense artillery fire, finally repelled the landing enemy.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: From dawn yesterday, enemy warships gathered at Liuhe, Xiaochuansha, Yanglinkou, and Qiyakou, attempting to land. Our side was on high alert, and as soon as the enemy warships approached, they were met with a fierce attack. Until last night, the enemy's landing attempt completely failed.</p>
<p>The enemy at Liuhe, under the cover of intense artillery fire from the night before, began to attack us fiercely, attempting to contain our forces so that the enemy surrounded by us in the Shengqiao area northeast of Luodian could break out. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed. Yesterday morning, several enemy planes bombed the Taicang and Jiading areas, destroying many civilian houses. Residents in the city fled in droves.</p>
<h3>Enemy Repelled at Yanglinkou</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 6th: At around 1:00 AM on the 6th, a unit of enemy troops arrived by ship at Yanglinkou and Qiyakou (northwest of Liuhe), attempting to land, and were immediately repelled by our garrison.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Extremely Active, Destroyed Two Enemy Warships Last Night</h3>
<p>A squadron of our bombers flew to Xiaochuanshakou outside the harbor last night at 7:00 PM to bomb enemy warships anchored there. Although the enemy warships fired intensely with anti-aircraft guns, our air force personnel were exceptionally brave and dropped multiple bombs in the midst of the gunfire. Two enemy warships were hit and caught fire, completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: Aviation circles report that a squadron of our air force bombers flew to Shanghai at 7:00 PM on the 6th to bomb enemy warships anchored outside Luodiankou. When our air force had flown close to the enemy warships, the enemy only then discovered them and hastily opened fire. Our army, moving freely amidst the intense barrage of artillery fire, dropped dozens of bombs. Two enemy destroyers caught fire. Shortly after, the flames intensified. Our army, seeing that they had completed their mission, returned safely to base together.</p>
<h3>Front Lines at Luodian and Other Places Consolidated</h3>
<p>According to official sources, there were minor skirmishes between the enemy and us in the Luodian area before 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The Baziqiao area was calm yesterday with no fighting. In the Pudong area, there was no fighting yesterday except for an enemy warship shelling it once. In the North Station area, only enemy planes bombed it. There were no changes to our army's front lines in the areas mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Enemy Landed on Beach Near Qiujiang Wharf, We Can Clear Them Out This Morning</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Yesterday, from morning to noon, enemy planes continuously bombed the Jungong Road-Yinxiangxiang downtown area and the Jiangwan area. In recent days, a total of five to six thousand enemy reinforcements have arrived in the Yangshupu area and, under the cover of enemy planes, attacked our positions along Jungong Road and Yinxiangxiang. Our army fought bravely, and the enemy did not succeed until evening. At the same time, more than 20 enemy warships anchored on the Jiangmian near Qiujiang Wharf bombarded us with intense artillery fire, covering the enemy's landing at Qiujiang Wharf. Our army also used intense machine gun fire to resist the enemy's landing. After a stalemate until yesterday afternoon, a portion of the enemy finally forced their way onto the beach near Qiujiang Wharf. Our army is closely monitoring the situation and plans to completely clear them out this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Bombarded Zhabei and Pudong Again</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Enemy warships fiercely attacked our army's positions in Pudong on the 2nd, covering the landing. They were repelled by us. Not having succeeded in their plan, the enemy remained silent for two days. After replenishing ammunition, they launched another fierce attack on the North Station area at midnight the day before yesterday. Our field artillery unit also opened fire in retaliation, and the mutual bombardment lasted for about an hour before ceasing. Then, at about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, an enemy destroyer bombarded Pudong again, with extremely dense artillery fire, shaking the entire city. Our side also retaliated and ordered the outposts to be on high alert to prevent the enemy from crossing over secretly. The enemy's plan failed, and the shelling stopped at about 7:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Continue to Transport Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The night before last and yesterday morning, another enemy transport ship and three merchant ships entered the Huangpu River. The transport ship docked at the Zhaoshang North Wharf, while the three merchant ships docked at the Osaka Wharf and the Huangpu Wharf. In addition to a portion of enemy troops landing, the enemy ships were all unloading ammunition, straw bags, and other military supplies, making them extremely busy. A large number of enemy heavy artillery pieces were unloaded at the Huangpu Wharf, with the barrels nearly two zhang long (approximately 6 meters), and the caliber was imaginable.</p>
<h3>Izumo Still Sailed Back to Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The enemy's Third Fleet flagship, Izumo, sailed to Songkou the night before last to plan and direct enemy warship operations. Yesterday at 0:15 PM, it sailed back to the Huangpu River and docked at the No. 2 buoy opposite the Gonghexing Wharf.</p>
<h3>Only Ten Enemy Warships in Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the enemy's recently reinforced Second Division and a large quantity of ammunition and equipment were transported to Shanghai by 49 enemy warships, most of them gathered outside the harbor, attempting to land and reinforce the enemy forces in the Wusong and Liuhe areas. At the same time, a portion sailed into the Huangpu River to reinforce the enemy forces in Yangshupu and Hongkou. The reinforcements and ammunition have been unloaded in batches over the past two days. The day before yesterday there were still eleven enemy warships in the Huangpu River, but yesterday there were only ten left. Most of the enemy warships are now gathered in the Wusongkou, Shizilin, and Liuhe areas to cover the enemy's renewed attacks. The situation of enemy warship docking in Huangpu River yesterday afternoon is investigated as follows: One gunboat each at No. 35, No. 23, No. 7, and No. 11 buoys; one destroyer each at No. 10 and No. 7 buoys; one Izumo flagship at No. 2 buoy; one destroyer of the 21st Squadron at the Japan Mail Line Wharf; one destroyer of the 16th Squadron at the Mitsubishi Wharf; and one transport ship No. 160 at the Zhaoshangju Middle Wharf, for a total of ten ships.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bombed Yangxing for Several Days</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 AM on the 3rd, six enemy planes flew over Yangxing Town. At that time, the Zhangjiaqiao Granary in the eastern part of the town was providing temporary relief, opening its doors to sell grain at reduced prices. Many residents went to buy grain, which was detected by the enemy planes, who suspected military activity, so they dropped seven or eight bombs, killing more than twenty innocent residents and injuring more than ten others. The ruthlessness of the Japanese army's methods is evident. The next day (the 4th) at 3:00 PM, more than ten enemy planes went to drop bombs and completely destroyed the most bustling streets from Niheng Bridge in the west to Sunjia Bridge, killing and injuring twenty or thirty people, a tragic scene. Yesterday morning (the 5th), another six enemy planes flew to the town and dropped bombs. Because the targets were inaccurate, the bombs all landed in the fields behind the town. However, one bomb landed near the Shaonniangniang Temple in the West Market, destroying a corner of the temple building, but there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bombed Western Shanghai Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at about 7:00 AM yesterday, enemy planes appeared again over the Xinjing area northwest of Shanghai and dropped a bomb on Piazzi Road. At that time, refugees fleeing from Beixinjing to the concession were passing through the area, resulting in six people being killed and two injured in the bombing.</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, six enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over Chenjiadu in western Shanghai before dropping two bombs and then flying east.</p>
<p>At 7:30 AM yesterday morning, four enemy planes dropped bombs over the Hongqiao area and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway in the northwest of the concession. Between 1:30 PM and 2:00 PM, enemy planes bombed the railway line south of the city center, north of St. John's University in western Shanghai, and near the Far East Racecourse.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Admire Our Brave Warriors</h3>
<p>On the 17th of last month, three of our planes flew to bomb the enemy Marine Corps headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. At that time, the enemy fired intensely with anti-aircraft guns. Unfortunately, one of our planes was damaged. Aviator Yan Haiwen immediately used a parachute to descend, but unexpectedly fell into the enemy's position. The enemy troops immediately surrounded Yan. Yan used his handgun to shoot at the enemy, killing several. He used the last bullet to shoot himself in the temple and died for his country. This heroic and sacrificial historical fact was published in large characters by Japanese newspapers. Yesterday, we received the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun from August 31st, which also published a lengthy dispatch describing this incident and expressing deep admiration for the brave warrior who made this heroic sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Frequent Fire Alarms in Hongkou Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out northwest of the Hongkou Fire Brigade. The fire was quite fierce. The major fire north of the Xilao on Huade Road had not been extinguished by 9:00 AM. Between noon and 2:00 PM, there were two fires near the Hongkou Fire Brigade. At 3:20 PM in the afternoon, there was a fire near the Hongkou Fire Brigade (near the public mortuary).</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Discovers Major Crisis: Decline of Reserve Soldiers</h3>
<p>Many unwilling to fight, commit suicide by drowning. Those forced to join the army weep.</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japan originally had more than 200,000 regular soldiers and 2 million reserve soldiers. Now, due to its active invasion of China, it has reorganized its regular soldiers into 41 divisions. However, the 2 million reserve soldiers are all the able-bodied men in the country, and it is impossible to expand them further. But recently, the Japanese military suddenly discovered a major crisis, that is, the corruption of the reserve soldiers, which the military relies on as a backing for the army, is enough to cause great panic in the military. According to these reserve soldiers, there are many of them. On weekdays, they use the remaining power of the warlords to oppress the villagers, and the people dare to be angry but dare not speak. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, they have become even more energetic. Reserve soldiers can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys showing off their power. Unexpectedly, when the military expanded the army this time, some of these reserve soldiers could not be called up, and some were even missing. The military was extremely shocked and is currently at a loss. There are also some reserve soldiers who, when they are enlisting, their relatives and friends see them off at the station, and they often shed tears to their relatives and friends. There are also reserve soldiers who are unwilling to fight and commit suicide by drowning. On August 22, in Omori Ward, Tokyo, three reserve soldiers, including Akaike Tsuneo, were arrested by the military police headquarters. Their criminal acts further prove the bankruptcy of the Yamato spirit, that is, selling military secrets to the embassy of a certain country. Therefore, there are more than one million reserve soldiers in Japan, and there are some corrupt elements among them, and the military still believes that the truth has not been revealed.</p>
<h3>North China Daily News Denounces Hirota's Speech</h3>
<p>Such Sophistical Arguments Cannot Deceive the Whole World. The Most Effective Propagators of Anti-Japanism are the Japanese Themselves.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News published a short commentary yesterday entitled "Localized Solution," which stated that Foreign Minister Hirota's speech attributed the current crisis in Shanghai to the Chinese government's refusal to submit to Japan's efforts to establish a localized solution. Although this specious argument may make those who imagine that accepting Japan's demands can avoid great losses and suffering resonate, it cannot deceive the world. Japan's pursuit of regional or localized solutions is not only contrary to its solemn expression of recognizing the Nanjing government as the central government of China, but also puts China in a difficult position, forcing it to submit to Japan and allowing it to fragmentarily seize Chinese territory, and there is no guarantee for the outcome of such a method. If the central government submits to Japan's conditions and makes a localized solution to the dispute that occurred at Lugouqiao, then the public will condemn its assertion that it will resist any continued invasion of Chinese territory as false. Therefore, the question of where it is most appropriate to resist arises in terms of politics and military affairs. Its selection of the Shanghai area, although as Hirota said, is a clear violation of the January 28 Shanghai Truce Agreement, the fact that Japan invaded North China and the attitude of the Tokyo government towards China's resistance to aggression in that area have made some discrepancies insignificant. One thing that must be remembered is that the mechanism established under the agreement to ensure faithful compliance has not been used, and only when Japan wants to cover up its clear movement of will, it wants to invoke the terms of the agreement, and of course it cannot arouse the enthusiasm of others. Especially because the Japanese indulged in atrocities in Hongkou and Yangshupu immediately after the signing of the agreement, and never complied with the spirit of the agreement, let alone complied with the words. Hirota is trying to use the Shanghai war to blame the Chinese authorities, but Hirota never realizes that he is not speaking in 1932. At that time, fluent rhetoric could excite people's hearts, but today it is very different from the past, because the whole world can perceive the harsh pressure exerted on the entire Chinese politics by the Japanese warlords. For example, when Hirota criticizes the Chinese government for implementing an extremely evil anti-Japanese movement, unfortunately, the drum he beats has a huge hole in it, so it cannot make pleasant sounds. To know that the most effective propagators of anti-Japanese sentiment in China are the Japanese militarism itself, and the eloquent Japanese speakers who declare the will of militarism at the right time and miss the right time.</p>

<h3>After Blocking Our Entire Coastline, Japan Strictly Searches Third-Country Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Italian merchant ship Longshan suffered two searches. Shipping companies from various countries telegraphed their home countries to protest.</p>
<p>After illegally blockading our coast, Japan first blockaded our central and southern regions from 32 degrees north latitude, 121 degrees 44 minutes east longitude, to 23 degrees 14 minutes north latitude, 116 degrees 40 minutes east longitude on August 25. Now, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy have expanded their scope starting on the 5th of this month, and blockaded the coast of North China, that is, from 39 degrees 54 minutes 40 degrees north latitude, and 119 degrees 54 minutes east longitude, to 21 degrees 33 minutes north longitude and 108 degrees 03 minutes east longitude. All of our coast, from Qinhuangdao in the north to Beihai Port in Guangzhou in the south, except for Qingdao, has been blockaded. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly declared that there will be no hindrance to the peaceful merchant ships of third countries, the North and South Pacific liners of Jardine Matheson and Swire have resumed operations as usual. Unexpectedly, yesterday Japanese warships disregarded everything and inspected third-country merchant ships entering Shanghai, and the search was not only once, which was extremely strict. The Longshan, flying the Italian flag, arrived in Wusong at noon yesterday. It was an empty ship from Ningbo to Shanghai, and then loaded refugees to go to Yong. Outside Wusongkou, it was first stopped by a Japanese warship, and personnel were sent to the ship for a detailed search. Because there were no items in the ship, it was allowed to leave. When it arrived at Wusongkou, it was stopped again, and personnel were sent on board for a more strict inspection. As a result, nothing was found, and it was allowed to leave. Another British ship was also required to be inspected by a Japanese warship. After the shipowner protested, the Japanese naval authorities said that all ships using Chinese ship names, even if they fly foreign flags, must still be inspected. Shipping companies from various countries in this port decided to report to their home countries and protest to Japan because they harmed the shipping interests of third countries.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th, Reuters: After Japan blockaded the South China coast, the British ship Taishan was the first foreign ship to be affected. When the ship was sailing from Hong Kong to Guangzhou today, it saw several Japanese destroyers at the mouth of the Pearl River, so it slowed down and sent a wireless telegram to consult with the shipowner. The Taishan then sailed up the river, but the ship was intercepted twice by a destroyer on the way back to Hong Kong, apparently because it suspected the nature of the goods it was carrying. The shipowner has stated that he will no longer sail to Guangzhou under any circumstances. It is now believed that there is a full squadron of Japanese destroyers patrolling the Guangdong coast, because the blockade has been extended to South China from today.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 6th, Havas: Japan announced the blockade of the entire coast of China on the 25th of last month. Experts from the British Foreign Office are studying the legal point of view, thinking that if Japan does not interfere with British legal shipping for one day, the British government does not intend to negotiate with Japan for one day. The Japanese government did not formally notify the British government of the expansion of the scope of the blockade, because this blockade can only be applied to Chinese ships.</p>

<h3>An Interview with a Person from Japan on the Fervent State of Japan</h3>
<p>Soldiers Embark, People Forced to Cheerfully Send Them Off / Wounded Soldiers Must Bow and Pay Respect Upon Landing / Cremated Remains of the War Dead Also Transported at the Same Time / Japanese Intellectuals Hope for the Overthrow of the Japanese Militarists</p>
<p>The Continental Press reports that Dr. MacMillan, the principal of Hangzhou Huilan School, has returned to China from the United States. Dr. MacMillan traveled east on the Siberian Railway, passing through several key locations in the Soviet Union and Japan, before arriving in Shanghai aboard the Shanghai Maru from Nagasaki. He stated yesterday that Japan and the Soviet Union are currently deeply hostile towards each other, but the situations in the two countries are vastly different. Japan as a whole seems to be in a state of fervor, with soldiers and preparations for war visible everywhere. Every time the train he was on passed through a station, hundreds of men, women, and children could be seen waving flags and shouting "Banzai!" to see off their relatives or neighbors departing to join the army. He had visited the Soviet Union twice since leaving the United States three months ago, and the situation there was very different from Japan. The people and government leaders of the Soviet Union all abhor war, which is unlike most countries in Europe except for England. Although the Soviet Union opposes war, it is very concerned about and expresses sympathy towards China and the Chinese people. Upon learning that he came from China, people eagerly inquired about events in China. Furthermore, a certain foreigner who arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the same ship as the doctor told a reporter from the Continental Press that when conscripted soldiers depart from the station, their neighbors are required to gather in groups to see them off. Residents of villages are also required to show their patriotism in groups. This is done under government orders, not out of the people's own volition. Although prices in Kobe have not risen significantly, foreigners generally believe that they will soar soon. If China's resistance only lasts for six months longer, Japan's financial difficulties will be unimaginable. Another foreigner who arrived in Shanghai from Japan stated that war activity is clearly visible in Nagasaki. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has specialized in the production of small arms and bullets, and other factories are likely doing the same. In peacetime, 60% of Nagasaki's residents rely on Mitsubishi factories for their livelihood. Although they all have jobs at the moment, it is unknown how they will make a living when peace is restored and the factory resumes manufacturing goods for the world market. Japan has already lost its best customer in the world, and it will be very difficult to regain them in the future. Another foreigner stated that Japanese ships returning from Shanghai often carry a large number of wounded Japanese officers. The stern cabins of the ships are entirely occupied by these men, totaling about fifty or sixty. When the ships arrive in Nagasaki, foreign passengers are not allowed to watch these wounded officers disembark. However, some people inside did glimpse everything. At the time, representatives of the military and civilians welcomed them at the dock. Every time a wounded person disembarked, these representatives would bow and pay their respects. Then, Japanese sailors spent half an hour carrying small boxes of cremated remains of fallen Japanese soldiers ashore. Judging by the time, the total number was probably in the hundreds, or even far more. According to travelers who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, there were eighteen Japanese transport ships anchored outside Wusongkou, and another ten or so anchored near the Junpu Bureau Wharf. Several hundred Japanese soldiers were also seen near Wusong. Four or five hundred horses were gathered at the racecourse facing the Huangpu River. Japanese soldiers were landing at Wusong by motorboat, with the boats moored near the Wusong River Bridge. More than twenty tanks were parked in the W.O.B. wharf area. From the Zhabei Waterworks to the Jiangbin Power Plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, not a single soldier from either side was seen, but several farmers were still quietly cultivating the land on both sides of the river. Before arriving in Wusong, more than twenty Japanese planes were seen flying over Chongming Island. Also, a certain famous beauty who arrived in Shanghai aboard the Shanghai Maru told a reporter from the Continental Press that knowledgeable people in Japan are all working hard to oppose war with China. When they talk about this matter with American friends, many say that the most beneficial thing for Japan and the Japanese people would be for the army and navy to suffer a good defeat in China. They all hate the mad actions of the military, but they are powerless to stop them and can only hope for their downfall.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Speaks on "National Salvation Bonds"</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang delivered a broadcast speech at 8 p.m. on the 6th, entitled "National Salvation Bonds." The original text is as follows: Fellow countrymen, since the beginning of the war of resistance, all compatriots throughout the country have held the determination to die and fight for the survival of the nation and the country. Death is a tragic thing, but there is something even more tragic to follow, which is to be a subjugated slave. Thinking that if we do not die, we will be subjugated slaves, then death is nothing to be sad about. Moreover, after becoming subjugated slaves, we will still die anyway. Because the invaders today will either exterminate our race or directly slaughter us, or indirectly cause us to kill each other. Both are death. Rather than dying as a subjugated slave, it is better to die fighting for the survival of the nation and the country. Everyone saw yesterday's newspaper. When the enemy troops were fighting in Luodian, a group of soldiers from the Three Northeastern Provinces were mixed among them, forced to charge. When the enemy troops in that area were surrounded by us, this group of soldiers from the Three Northeastern Provinces mostly shouted in Mandarin, carrying weapons to return to us. They have all been sent to a certain place. These people have all requested our military officers to join the front line and fight to the death against the enemy. This passage in the newspaper's record probably moved everyone who read it. We cannot rescue the compatriots in the Three Northeastern Provinces and free them from the position of subjugated slaves. And when the compatriots in the Three Northeastern Provinces were forced by the enemy to engage in mutual slaughter, they saw that rather than dying in mutual slaughter, it is better to die killing the enemy. Rather than dying as a subjugated slave, it is better to die fighting for the survival of the nation and the country. The ancients said it well, "Death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather." To die fighting the enemy for the nation and the country, the value of this death is truly heavier than Mount Tai. Because when we die, our nation and country will survive. I have repeatedly said before that we must all have the determination to die, and then we can persevere. If we can persevere, then we can win. Now, the facts show that everyone has the determination to die, which is no longer a problem. Now we can go a step further and talk about perseverance. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the heroic sacrifices in Nankou and other places cannot be fully described at the moment. Now, let's just take the nearby Songhu War of Resistance and the capital's air defense as examples. We still remember that during the January 28th Incident, enemy warships were scattered all over the place from Wusongkou to Hankou, with more than 40 ships in total. In Nanjing alone, there were seven ships, docked in Xiaguan, unloading their gun covers and pointing their guns at the city of Nanjing. But now, enemy warships can only be stationed outside Wusongkou, at most they can only be docked on the Huangpu Beach, and cannot go any further. During the January 28th Incident, the first troops we had fighting in Songhu were only the 19th Route Army, and later the 5th Army joined. The remaining reinforcements, either because of inconvenient transportation and difficult marching, or because unification had not been completed and orders could not be carried out in areas that the government's power had not reached. But now, the highways of various provinces are sufficient for marching, and with the success of unification, the troops of the whole country are under the command of the supreme commander. Once the order is given, they start immediately, like a body using its arms, like an arm using its fingers. The goal of the entire country and the entire nation fighting together has been achieved. During the January 28th Incident, we only saw enemy planes soaring over our territory, parading freely, firing machine guns whenever they wanted, dropping bombs whenever they wanted, taking our beloved compatriots and brave soldiers, with blood and flesh flying everywhere, to provide them with laughter. We could only stare with our eyes and grit our teeth. But now, we have anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. When enemy planes break in, they are driven away by our anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. Those that cannot escape fall to the ground like dog droppings. This is what we have seen and heard with our own eyes and ears in the past 20 days or so. The above examples are enough to prove that in the past few years, the government has been holding back tears and squeezing out the blood and sweat of the people drop by drop to do national defense equipment and other economic construction. It was not spent in vain. In general, resistance requires spirit and also material. Today we can have such resistance, is the result of the soldiers with the blood and sweat of the people for several years squeezed out, plus their own blood and sweat produced. Speaking of this, our blood straight up, we are bound to continue to squeeze out all the blood and sweat, and the previous and now all the soldiers and all the people's blood and sweat, confluence together, into a river, to extinguish the arrogance of the invaders, wash away all the humiliation of being invaded in history. The above is the meaning of this issue of National Salvation Bonds. As I said just now, there are only two ways to save the country: spirit and material. In terms of spirit, such as organization and training, it is important in peacetime, but especially important in wartime. If you pay attention to it, then organization and training will make rapid progress due to the needs and experience of wartime, which will be ten times faster than in peacetime. The same is true in terms of material, from military supplies to various supplies, all are necessary. Whether the military can last depends entirely on whether the finances can last.

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee Questions the Situation in China</h3>
<p>Konoe Declares Seeking a Quick Victory Against China / Hirota Does Not Forget the Clarification of North China</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee met this morning. Minsei Party member Kotaro Ogawa asked the Prime Minister what he meant by "making the Chinese army lose its will to fight." There will soon be major battles in North China and Shanghai. If China does not reflect, will it enter a long-term war? Under what kind of premise is this supplementary budget based? Konoe replied that he would be sure to give them a thorough blow as soon as possible. Minister of Finance Kaya replied that he could not say when the additional budget of more than 2 billion yuan would be fixed. Minister of the Army Sugiyama replied that if there were no major changes in the war, there would be no need to convene a special session of the Diet. Ogawa then asked what the government thought of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the Chinese ambassador to Japan said that the treaty was of a passive nature and there was no secret agreement, and that China would not become communist. The new Soviet ambassador to Japan also said that the Soviet Union had no intention of interfering in Sino-Japanese relations. Seiyukai member Tadahiko Okada asked what the future of North China would be. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the future of North China would have to wait until the end of the war, and that it was necessary to make it a clear area for Japan, China, and "Manchukuo." Kunimatsu Hamada asked about the Nine-Power Treaty. Hirota replied that he could not say at present. Okada then asked if American labor unions were refusing to transport goods to Japan. Hirota replied that he expected the US government to take appropriate measures. He also asked what methods the government would take to make other countries understand Japan's attitude. Hirota replied that not only diplomatic officials would be involved, but also people with close ties to various countries would be asked to work hard to convey Japan's true intentions.

<h3>The United States Still Takes a Watching Attitude Toward the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>The Policy Can Be Changed at Any Time / Temporarily Based on Not Closing the Door to Reconciliation</p>
<p>[New York] President Roosevelt is currently cruising on the yacht "Potomac" off the coast of Rhode Island. He recently met with reporters on the yacht and gave a speech on the situation in the Far East, saying that the US government is still taking a watching attitude toward the conflict between China and Japan. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Block Island, USA President Roosevelt told reporters today that the US government's policy toward the Sino-Japanese war is still limited to 24 hours and can be changed at any time. As for the 7,780 American people living in China, most of them are Christian missionaries and are far from the sea. If they do not withdraw at this time, they are taking a risk. The government currently has no plans to increase warships in the Far East. The existing military force is sufficient to evacuate expatriates. Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue itself, the President declined to comment, saying only that the situation was difficult to resolve. He also said that the government has not yet decided whether to implement the Neutrality Act. It is understood that the President believes that the presence of American expatriates and soldiers near the war zone is an obstacle to the implementation of the law. (5th Guomin Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Most people in American political and public opinion circles recently commented on the international situation, deeply believing that the Far East incident and the current tense situation in the Mediterranean are mutually related. They believe that countries that are obsessed with force and countries that seek to prevent the spread of anarchy are irreconcilable. The Far East incident and the tense situation in the Mediterranean are two stages of this global conflict. In short, people in the United States now feel that the "expansionism" promoted by Japan and Italy is a threat to the United States in terms of ideology and economy. This is why the principles set forth by Secretary of State Hull in his written statement have a universal nature. Also, the commentaries in American newspapers today mostly clarify that the policy pursued by the United States in the Far East is enough to affect the situation around the world. This is also why. According to current American public opinion, one faction advocates implementing the Neutrality Act. But on the other hand, there are many important people who support the policy pursued by Secretary of State Hull, saying that if the US government implements the Neutrality Act, it will be regarded as cowardly by Japan and will deny the principles listed by the Secretary of State. This is actually because the US government does not want to close the door to a peaceful resolution of any dispute in the Far East or elsewhere. However, the US's patience has a limit, but it is unwilling to specify to what extent. (Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 5th)</p>
<h3>US Peace Groups Demand Neutrality</h3>
<p>Say US Situation Similar to European War Era; Several Thousand US Troops Arrive in Shanghai to Protect Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Washington] Six national peace groups today issued a joint statement, saying that if the US government does not implement the Neutrality Act regarding the Sino-Japanese war, it would be tantamount to abolishing the act. The Far East situation is similar to when the United States joined the European War. Merchants profit from the war, foreign propagandists are active, and incidents occur frequently. We should deal with this with a cool head and demand that the President implement the Neutrality Act. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, the State Department issued a statement yesterday, saying that currently, the government has no legal right to prohibit domestic merchants from supplying arms or lending money to China and Japan. Six American pacifist groups (including tens of thousands of members), upon hearing this, decided to demand that President Roosevelt immediately implement the Neutrality Act, so that the government can prohibit domestic merchants from selling arms to China and Japan and lending money to these countries, based on the Neutrality Act or its clauses. In addition, the groups have drafted a letter to the nation, to be distributed by various local branches, stating, "The current events in the Far East are very similar to the situation in 1917 that led the United States to enter the war. The next few days are crucial and must be approached with caution. Those who profit by transporting arms to China and Japan are sending American ships into war zones, which is extremely dangerous. Now, foreign propagandists have begun their activities in the United States, leading to daily incidents in the country. All our compatriots must remain calm and not be deceived, and should demand that President Roosevelt immediately implement the Neutrality Act." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Engaging in a "Blockade" War with the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since the enemy invaded Shanghai, more than ten days have passed without success. On the 25th of last month, the Third Fleet announced the blockade of our southern coast. From northern Jiangsu to Shantou in Guangdong, the enemy is preparing to attack all of our country's merchant ships. This blockade has been in effect for ten days, without any impact on us, and the enemy's blind and reckless attacks in the Wusong-Liuhang area have still made no progress. Therefore, the enemy's Ministry of Navy announced that, starting from the 5th of this month, it would blockade the entire southeastern coast of our country. The implementation of this step, on the one hand, shows that the barbaric and vicious enemy has exhausted all means of aggression against us. But on the other hand, it also shows that although the enemy is fierce and strong, in the war of the past two weeks, it has actually "run out of tricks." Its announcement of the blockade of our entire coast is merely a helpless means of threat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of international law, the enemy's current invasion of us has not been formally declared a war. To implement a blockade of our coast is completely contrary to the norms of international law. However, given the ferocity and unreasonableness of Japanese imperialism, it is fundamentally impossible to reason with it on the basis of legal principles. We should consider this absurd action of Japanese imperialism from only two key points. First, whether its blockade of our entire coast will cause us any harm. Second, how we should deal with this threatening behavior of the enemy.</p>
<p>In military terms, the implementation of a coastal blockade mainly has two purposes. The first is to blockade the enemy's fleet in a certain area during naval operations, eliminating its combat capability. The second is to cut off the enemy's merchant ship traffic on ocean routes, in order to destroy the enemy's foreign trade and prevent the enemy's external supplies. However, the implementation of such a blockade often contains great dangers, namely, affecting the interests of third-party neutral countries. Like in the last World War, Germany recklessly implemented a naval blockade, sinking many American merchant ships, and eventually causing the neutral United States to join the Allied Powers, leading to the disastrous defeat of German imperialism.</p>
<p>We can observe the impact of this blockade by Japanese imperialism on us by considering the two purposes of the above-mentioned coastal blockade. First, our country has no navy. Our war against Japanese imperialism is mainly a land and air war. So the purpose of blockading our navy is fundamentally out of the question. Second, although our country has a small portion of coastal merchant shipping, because we have never had overseas investments and do not need to rely on overseas markets, the enemy's attempt to cut off our foreign trade is completely unsuccessful. In fact, in recent years, with the comings and goings of enemy warships along our coast and deep into our hinterland, there has been all kinds of private trade and drug trafficking, which has completely destroyed our customs and harmed countless civilians. Now that the war has begun and the enemy has announced a blockade, this kind of activity that undermines our economy and damages our national strength has been cleared away in one fell swoop. From this point of view, the enemy's blockade of our coast is not only harmless to us, but also has certain benefits. Moreover, the enemy's loss to third parties and attracting the opposition of neutral countries during the period of blockading us is even more beneficial to us.</p>
<p>However, it is to be expected that the enemy will carry out atrocities in various coastal areas of our country after it has announced the blockade of our coast. We should give a strong response to such barbaric acts by the enemy. The simplest and most direct thing is that when the enemy carries out threats against our coast, we should give a strong response with strong defense. At the same time, we should promptly expose the enemy's barbaric atrocities on our coast to the world. We believe that in the recent indication by American sailors to refuse to transport goods to Japan, we can see the deep sympathy of maritime workers around the world for us, which is something that Japanese imperialism cannot imagine. In addition to the sailors of friendly countries around the world, our compatriots scattered all over the world, especially those along the Pacific coast, will also be a great force to launch a "counter-blockade" against Japan. In recent years, Japanese goods have been dumped in Southeast Asia. It is said that overseas Chinese are also important buyers. Japanese merchant ships travel to various oceans, and our compatriots are employed as sailors. From now on, our compatriots should take resolute action to implement a blockade, so that the enemy's foreign trade and commercial transportation will be fatally hit. We will teach the enemy a lesson, that is, their blockade is not enough to cause us any loss, while our extensive blockade can hit the enemy's true weakness.</p>
<h3>Case of Japanese Aircraft Injuring British Ambassador</h3>
<p>Britain Demands a Prompt Reply</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, by Japanese aircraft, diplomatic sources recently stated that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, has held several talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, asking him to pay attention to the need for a prompt reply. However, diplomatic sources have not confirmed the news from Tokyo that the Japanese government has submitted a draft reply to Sir Robert Clive. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota mentioned the attack on British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, in the Diet today, saying that there is no clear evidence to prove that the British Ambassador's vehicle was attacked by Japanese aircraft. He is convinced that the Japanese army would never deliberately attack non-combatants. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the case of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being injured by Japanese aircraft, the Labour Party's Daily Herald recently reported that if Japan does not submit a reply to the note that Britain sent to the Japanese government on the 28th of last month before the 8th of this month, the British government will consider other measures, such as immediately recalling the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive. The British government has also notified Japan that it hopes for an early reply to this note. The report also stated that if Japan attempts to evade responsibility for the actions of its air force personnel, it will not be acceptable to Britain. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] The "Sunday Express" predicts that if Japan refuses any of the three demands contained in the protest note regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, Britain will issue another protest. It also stated that if Japan still does not pay attention to the new note, Anglo-Japanese diplomatic relations will be temporarily suspended. The newspaper continued to say that Wednesday's cabinet meeting will discuss ways to protect British interests in China. (Haitong telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph recently commented on the war between China and Japan, saying that it is doubtful whether Japan can quickly overcome China or reach a compromise with China. If the Sino-Japanese war drags on, Japan will inevitably encounter various financial difficulties. It is hoped that the two countries can still cooperate sincerely. "Japan originally thought that the war against China could be ended quickly, and even if the Chinese army resisted, it would not be difficult to immediately wipe them out, but this estimate is clearly inaccurate."

<h3>Mediterranean Conference to Have Heated Debate</h3>
<p>Opening in Switzerland on the 10th of This Month; Germany and Italy Invited to Attend</p>
<p>[Paris] According to reliable sources, the Mediterranean Conference will be held on September 10 in Nyon, Switzerland, which is located between Geneva and Lausanne. French newspapers predict that there will be heated debates and surprising developments at the meeting. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to official news, the British and French governments formally invited Italy, Germany, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, and Greece, ten countries, to send representatives to attend the Mediterranean Security Conference this evening. Among them, Germany was invited because of its participation in the Spanish coastal surveillance plan, and the Soviet Union, Romania, and Bulgaria (i.e., the countries along the Black Sea coast) were invited because of their extremely important relationship to Mediterranean shipping. As for the two parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, they were not invited. As is generally known, the British and French governments believe that the safety of ships of Mediterranean countries must be resolved. It would be best if a solution could be found before the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly (September 13). Therefore, the Mediterranean Conference will begin on the 10th of this month. The British and French governments are continuing to consult in order to formulate the agenda. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is generally expected that Italy will accept the invitation to participate in the Mediterranean Conference. Italian newspapers initially criticized France's plan to convene a conference of Mediterranean coastal countries, but after learning that Britain was actively involved in the preparation of the Mediterranean Conference agenda, they stopped attacking. The newspapers all said that the facts that the Mediterranean Conference had decided not to be held in Geneva and that Italy and Germany had been invited to participate in the conference proved that France's original plan and its opposition to Italy had failed. Currently, the newspapers are only criticizing the Mediterranean Conference, saying that it duplicates the tasks of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Mediterranean Conference is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month in Nyon, Switzerland. According to Foreign Ministry officials, the German government has not yet received an invitation. Even if it receives an invitation, it will not immediately respond to the British government, because German political leaders are currently in Nuremberg, attending the National Socialist Party's annual conference. Foreign Ministry officials also believe that regarding the Mediterranean Conference, the German government has been closely cooperating with the Italian government. The German government has repeatedly stated its views on the Mediterranean ship attack incidents. After the German cruiser Leipzig was bombarded by the Spanish government army, the German government made protests and various suggestions. If the British and French governments had considered these at that time, the current Mediterranean countries conference would have been redundant. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party's Annual Conference</h3>
<p>700,000 Participants</p>
<p>⊙Nuremberg 700,000 members of the National Socialist Party are holding their annual conference here today. Führer Hitler will arrive here by plane on Monday to deliver an important speech. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Stuttgart Among the delegations returning from overseas to participate in the National Socialist Party's overseas representatives conference, there is a delegation returning from China, led by Dr. Wahl, a parliamentary leader. Dr. Wahl met with a Haitong News Agency reporter yesterday and solemnly declared that the overseas Chinese who returned from China are very concerned about the development of the Far East events and have unlimited sympathy for China. Dr. Wahl pointed out that the Far East events have also brought misfortune to the German overseas Chinese, such as the death of Ektor, a sixteen-year-old member of the Hitler Youth Group from Shanghai, who was killed in a bombing at the Sincere Company. Dr. Wahl expressed hope that China can soon recover peace, so that it can continue the economic recovery work that has had significant success in recent years. At the same time, Dr. Wahl also hopes that the traditional friendship between China and Germany will continue, so that the commerce of both countries will benefit. Finally, Dr. Wahl reported that there are National Socialist Party district branches in nine places in China: Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. (Haitong telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Association to Hold Special Meeting</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Geneva Establish National Salvation Association</p>
<p>[Geneva] With the violent Japanese invasion of our country, Zhu Jia-hua, president of the League of Nations Association's branch in our country, telegraphed the headquarters of the World League of Nations Association in Geneva, requesting that an extraordinary meeting be convened to find ways to stop the violent actions of Japan. The secretariat of the association has accepted the request, but the association's president, Rohlin, only instructed Secretary-General Rusen to prepare for the 12th special council meeting, because a council meeting is easier to convene and more effective than an extraordinary meeting. The Geneva branch of the China Association has received Zhu's telegram and decided to send three representatives to participate in the council meeting. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Overseas Chinese in various European countries have established national salvation associations one after another. The Geneva National Salvation Association was also officially established today. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a memorial week on the 6th. Chairman Lin, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Bohua, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Chen Qicai, and others, as well as civil servants, military officers, accountants, and staff from the three departments, attended.

<p>[Nanjing] Belgian Ambassador Guillaume de Wassemberge visited Chairman Lin at the National Government at 10:30 a.m. on the 6th to present his credentials. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After the Belgian Ambassador returned to the embassy on the 6th, Chairman Lin sent Lu Chao to deliver the Chairman's business card as a return courtesy. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Students Studying in the United States to Sail Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Each Purchase National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>This year's students studying in the United States are scheduled to sail tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., they continued to discuss departure procedures at the meeting hall and handled issues such as boarding the Chichibu Maru to Hong Kong tomorrow. They also each purchased ten yuan of National Salvation Bonds before leaving the country, reaching a total of five hundred yuan, which has been transferred to the Anti-Enemy Support Association.</p>
<h3>Japanese Shelling of the Longshan Wheel; Japanese Side Has Responded</h3>
<p>The Wheel Still Carries Refugees Out of Port This Morning</p>
<p>The Italian Shipping Company's Longshan Wheel previously carried refugees sent back to Ningbo by the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. It had previously agreed with the Japanese military to freely enter and exit the Wusongkou without Japanese interference. Unexpectedly, the previous day, while transporting refugees out of Shanghai, it was shelled by Japanese warships in an attempt to threaten and intimidate. After the shipowner reported to the company, the Italian Consulate in Shanghai protested to the Japanese Consulate. It is now learned that the Japanese Consulate has given a satisfactory reply to the Italian Consulate. Therefore, the Longshan Wheel returned to Ningbo from Shanghai yesterday morning and still carried more than 4,000 refugees. It is scheduled to open tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau's New River Wheel Jinjiang Sunk by Bombing</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Specializing in Destruction</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's River Wheel Jinjiang, a new river boat made with a cost of forty thousand yuan to rebuild a new hull, held a launch ceremony on June 23. It was originally planned to go to Chongqing on its maiden voyage in the latter half of this month. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai war broke out. The construction of the wheel, now at 19%, was stopped on the Gaochangmiao river surface. For days, enemy aircraft indiscriminately bombed non-combat areas and peaceful civilians, causing the "Jinjiang New Wheel" to be bombed by multiple bombs dropped by enemy aircraft yesterday and sunk.</p>
<h3>More Than 50,000 Refugees Still in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Statistics</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's statistics, as of the 5th of this month, there are a total of 117 refugee shelters in the International Settlement that have been inspected by the Council's Health Department, accommodating 58,236 refugees. On the 5th of this month, 79 refugees were vaccinated by Council staff. On the 4th of this month, 1,318 people were vaccinated and 995 people were injected with preventive vaccines.</p>
<h3>French Deputy Prime Minister Speaks; World Peace is Indivisible</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Socialist Party branch in Vanves, a suburb of Paris, held a meeting today. State Councilor and Socialist Party leader Léon Blum spoke, stating that the Far East situation and the Spanish problem were related to the Sino-Japanese war. If the Spanish Civil War had not broken out, Japan's actions might have been more cautious. Conversely, if Britain had not been forced to closely monitor the Far East situation, its attitude towards European issues might have been more resolute. It can be seen that peace is indivisible and has a universal nature, both in space and time. "Five years ago, if the countries had not allowed Japan to invade China's Northeast, the Far East situation might not have been what it is today." He then spoke about the Spanish problem, saying that the non-intervention policy advocated by France and the various efforts made in the past have actually failed. This is undeniable. The Spanish coastal surveillance plan no longer exists. The measure of withdrawing volunteers from Spain has been unable to be implemented due to the repeated delays by Germany and Italy in the London Adjustment Committee.

The measures have already been internally determined, and as soon as the passbooks are printed, the acceptance of savings deposits will begin.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Cables Business Associations to Solicit Donations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, your telegram received. Your association's patriotic enthusiasm is highly commendable. National salvation bonds have been scheduled to be issued on September 1. It is hoped that you will actively solicit donations to gather substantial funds as early as possible to meet the needs. Special reply. Seal of the Ministry of Finance, Winter." The Chamber of Commerce replied by telegram, stating: "Nanjing Ministry of Finance, respectfully acknowledge your telegram, Winter. The association has already established the Shanghai Business Community Solicitation Corps for National Salvation Bonds, hoping to contribute a small effort to fulfill the task of the people and live up to the anxieties of your ministry.

Rural credit cooperatives for agricultural loans are also included.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation Encourages Citizens to Purchase</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city is very actively soliciting donations for national salvation bonds. In addition to leading the district branches to organize solicitation teams, the federation has also issued a letter to the citizens, stating in essence: "The disaster of the invaders is deepening, and the national crisis is urgent. Everyone has the responsibility to sacrifice their families to relieve the national crisis. This war is a long-term resistance war, and we must have adequate preparations to achieve final victory. Therefore, the government is now issuing national salvation bonds to complete the mission of long-term resistance and national revival. Our citizens, by purchasing national salvation bonds, on the one hand, express their patriotic fervor, and on the other hand, save themselves. Everyone, think about it, if the country is destroyed, can individuals still exist alone? Can life and property still be guaranteed? Moreover, purchasing national salvation bonds will be repaid with interest in the future, which is a good savings deposit for saving the country and saving oneself. We urge all compatriots to purchase enthusiastically to the best of their financial ability."</p>
<p>YMCA Plans to Raise 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has decided to organize 50 solicitation teams to solicit donations for national salvation bonds. Prominent figures in the city will be invited to serve as team leaders. It is reported that Social Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan will be invited to serve as the commander of the solicitation team, and opinions are being sought. It is also learned that the fundraising target of the association this time is 100,000 yuan. The targets of the solicitation are divided into two types: one is the member team, which is composed of members of the association, and the other is the friend team, which is composed of people who sympathize with the YMCA and those who sympathize with this movement.</p>

<h3>Wartime Financial Measures Take Effect, Various Industries Stabilize</h3>
<p>Four Banks Extend Loans as Much as Possible to Stimulate Market Turnover; Pawnshops Remain Open as Usual, Providing Support for Ordinary People</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the wartime financial stabilization measures, Shanghai's banking industry has followed the ministry's orders and achieved good results. Now, in order to take care of the economic turnover and livelihood maintenance of small depositors, the Ministry of Finance has specifically re-stipulated that deposits below 300 yuan can be withdrawn in full, without being subject to the 5% withdrawal restriction, and has sent letters to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Farmers Bank to comply. At the same time, the banking industry not only facilitates withdrawals for pawnshops, but also provides as much loan as possible. Therefore, various pawnshops have sufficient economic reserves and accept as many pawned items from the poor as possible. Most of the pawnshops in the Hongkou area have moved into the Public Concession or French Concession to operate. Even in the Nanshi area, although they are sometimes subject to enemy reconnaissance and bombing, they still open as usual during the stipulated hours, from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. The circulation of the economy of ordinary people has benefited greatly. According to Xin Xin Sheng reporter's investigation, since the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China Farmers Bank were ordered to organize a joint lending committee to regulate finance and stimulate the market, the committee has accepted applications for mortgages with securities or goods from only a few smaller banks and firms as much as possible. Therefore, the financial situation of the market and the situation of various industries are very stable.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Refugees Transported Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>First Batch of 10,000 People Sent by Wuhu and Wuxue Ships</p>
<p>There are many Jiangbei refugees in the various refugee shelters in this city, numbering nearly fifty to sixty thousand. Now, the Jiangbei native associations have decided to send these refugees without jobs or work back to their hometowns so that they can find other means of livelihood. After consultation with Yu Qiaqing, the British firm Taikoo &amp; Co. has been asked to station the two large ships Wuhu and Wuxue at the Taikoo &amp; Co. Wharf in the French Concession. The first batch of approximately 10,000 people will be transported today morning, and the two ships will transport them to Tongzhou for landing. All procedures were completed yesterday, and permission has been granted to transport them out this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hawkers in the French Concession Must All Donate for Permits</h3>
<p>The authorities of the French Concession of this port, in order to maintain order within the concession, starting today, all street hawkers must obtain permits to operate, otherwise they will be detained and fined. Also, yesterday afternoon, a large number of military police were dispatched to major intersections on various roads to search pedestrians and vehicles (commonly known as "chao ba zi") to prevent troublemakers from disturbing public order.</p>
<h3>US Warship Officers and Soldiers Perform a Play to Aid Refugees</h3>
<p>Thursday Evening at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the people in the war zone have been devastated by the enemy's artillery fire and have become refugees, wandering in the concessions. The scene is unbearable. Some of them have already been sent back to their hometowns by various charitable organizations, but there are still many who have not left Shanghai due to traffic congestion. Clothing and food are insufficient, and the situation is extremely pitiful. It is learned that the officers and soldiers of the flagship Augusta, commanded by US Navy Commander General Yierlu, have scheduled a play at the Grand Theater this Thursday (the 9th) evening. The proceeds from ticket sales will be used to donate to help refugees in distress. There will also be singing and music programs. This shows a glimpse of the sympathy of foreigners for us.</p>
<h3>Charity Federation Seeks Winter Clothing and Bedding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association has already sheltered more than 20,000 refugees, and the provision of supplies is vast and difficult. In addition, the war zone is expanding daily, and there is no end in sight. Refugees from various places are still arriving in a steady stream. The difficulties in the future will be even greater than today. Moreover, the time is approaching, and the weather is getting colder. The refugees' clothes are very thin and should be considered in advance. Therefore, we sincerely request that people from all walks of life, in addition to generously donating food and cash, also donate winter clothing and bedding if available. This will benefit the disaster victims greatly.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Yuan and Ministry, Requesting Suspension of Payment of Japanese Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Nanjing Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance, In view of the fact that Japan's use of the Boxer Indemnity paid by our country has always been, according to Japan's unilateral claim, a tool for cultural aggression against China, which is different from the actual concessions of the United Kingdom and the United States for beneficial undertakings in our country, public opinion has long been deeply saddened by this. Now that we are fully engaged in the war, there is no reason to provide the enemy with huge sums of money. It is proposed that we follow the precedent of suspending payments to Germany in previous years when war was declared, order the customs to suspend payments temporarily, or temporarily store the funds in a special account without using them or handing them over, and notify the other party. When peace is restored, the funds will be remitted. This will not only safeguard our credit but also serve the purpose of self-defense. We sincerely request the approval and implementation of the Executive Yuan (Ministry). This is for the public good. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>
<h3>Aviation Lottery Continues to Be Issued</h3>
<p>The Rumor of Suspending the Next Issue Is Incorrect</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the aviation lottery would continue to be issued and then suspended after a certain period. To verify the information, the reporter inquired with the Ministry of Finance. According to the person in charge, the lottery will continue to be issued as usual, and there is no plan to suspend it. The report is completely untrue.</p>
<h3>Two Savings Deposit Branch Offices' Services Transferred to Other Offices</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Savings and Remittance Business Notice No. 57 states: "It has been investigated that the savings and remittance business of the branch offices in the Nanshi and Zhabei Hongkou areas has been transferred to other offices. The detailed measures have been announced in this Bureau's Savings and Remittance Business Notice No. 56. It has now been found that the Huajin Road and Ximen branch offices are still operating as usual at their original locations. However, in order to facilitate the public's savings and withdrawals, the savings management of the Huajin Road branch office and the savings business of the Ximen branch office will be temporarily transferred to the Kaizi Er Road branch office. Those who have opened general savings accounts at these two branch offices can still deposit and withdraw funds at the savings branch offices in this district. As for the drafts to be cashed by the respective branch offices, they will be cashed by the Masnan Road branch office. All measures will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Savings and Remittance Business Notice No. 56. This notice is hereby announced for general knowledge. Director Zha Peilin, September 5."</p>
<h3>More Than 600 Baoshan Refugees Fled to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Charity Federation Opens Shelters</p>
<p>Many Baoshan refugees fled to Shanghai yesterday. These refugees gathered outside the Cilian Association on Yunnan Road, Six Malu. The total number of people was no less than 600. The disaster relief section of the association dispatched personnel to contact the authorities of the Hengshun Building on Dajin Road, and obtained their permission. The building was set up as a shelter, and at about 3:00 p.m., the above-mentioned refugees were transported to the building by large trucks for accommodation, and a large amount of food was delivered for distribution to fill their stomachs.</p>

<h3>Siege of Baoshan Lifted, Our Forces Taking Advantage of the Victory to Advance Vigorously</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops at Qiujiang Wharf Have Been Forced Back to the Riverbank; Our Army's Counterattack on Shizilin is Quite Successful</p>
<p>From last night to this afternoon, the enemy troops in Baoshan were subjected to a fierce pincer attack from within and without by our forces and suffered heavy losses. Although they were still in danger, they were no longer a cause for concern. The enemy who landed at the Qiujiang Wharf was severely attacked by our forces and forced back to the riverbank. On the Shizilin front, the enemy's artillery fire fiercely bombarded the area all day yesterday. At dusk, it was once lost. Later, our army counterattacked and was quite successful. The military authorities received reports from the front that there were contacts in Luodian, Liuhe, Bazibqiao, and Yangshupu last night and this morning, but they were not fierce, and there were no changes in the front lines of both sides. On the Pudong front, enemy planes continued to harass. At the Chunjiang Wharf, the enemy troops frequently attempted to land, but were unsuccessful due to our strict defense. Another report stated that several enemy planes went to the Zhenru and Nanxiang areas this morning to drop bombs.</p>
<h3>Baoshan's Remaining Enemy Troops Are No Longer a Cause for Concern</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Never Entered Baoshan City; Our Army is Conducting a Thorough Search From Within and Without</p>
<p>Authentic information indicates that a battalion of our army stationed in Baoshan City is still holding fast and awaiting reinforcements. The battalion commander was still in contact with our army outside the city by telegram at about 1:00 a.m. this morning. Our army is conducting a thorough search for the remaining enemy in the surrounding area outside the city. At the same time, another large elite army is tracking and pursuing the enemy on the northeast side of Baoshan, vowing to annihilate them before stopping. Another report stated that because our army was holding Baoshan City to the death, the enemy troops never entered the city. As of this afternoon, our army outside the city was actively counterattacking.</p>
<p>The enemy in Baoshan County City attacked from the east gate. At that time, a battalion of our army was in the west of the city. Later, our reinforcements arrived and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's attempt to encircle the city on the outskirts of the city. Our soldiers who were defending the west of the city took the opportunity to attack the east gate. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy urgently increased reinforcements, hoping to encircle our reinforcements again. At that time, our elite troops had already arrived and immediately launched a fierce counterattack. After six hours of fierce fighting, the enemy finally couldn't hold out and retreated completely. The siege of Baoshan County City was thus lifted, and the remaining enemies at the east gate scrambled to retreat towards Wusong Town. Our army is pursuing them. There are still a few remnants scattered in the four suburbs of the city, and they are also being cleaned up. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and we also suffered losses. However, our morale was high, so those who stood in the way were all crushed. Although enemy shells fell like rain, they could not suppress our edge. There was a fierce battle south of Baoshan City this morning, which was caused by our army pursuing the remnants towards Wusong after lifting the siege of Baoshan County City. When the reporter was drafting the manuscript, our army was still advancing.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops at Qiujiang Wharf Retreat in Defeat</h3>
<p>The Enemy Was Hit Hard Before They Gained a Foothold; Our Army Took Advantage of the Victory to Pursue and Has Approached the Jungong Road</p>
<p>Around Qiujiang Wharf, the enemy troops who landed there yesterday numbered between 4,000 and 6,000. After landing, they set up positions along the Jungong Road on various high grounds. Starting at 1:00 a.m. this morning, our army launched a full-scale counterattack. Loyal and brave soldiers all moved forward courageously. Because the enemy troops had not gained a firm foothold, they responded in a panic. After being hit hard by our army, the enemy troops retreated in confusion under the cover of artillery fire. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue. At dawn this morning, it had approached the Jungong Road.</p>
<p>According to another message, yesterday the enemy troops who landed at Qiujiang Wharf, under the cover of enemy planes, attacked our positions in the Jungong Road and Yinxiang Township area. Many enemy ships parked on the Pujiang surface of Qiujiang Wharf also bombarded us with dense artillery fire. Our side fired with machine guns. From morning to night, the two sides fought fiercely for more than ten hours. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. There are currently about 2,000 of them waiting for an opportunity to move on the sand surface near Qiujiang Wharf. However, our defense line there is solid, and the enemy will never succeed.</p>
<p>China News Agency said that yesterday midnight, our army launched a fierce attack on the Qiujiang Wharf area. As of this morning, our army has forced the enemy troops to retreat to the riverbank.</p>
<h3>There Was Fierce Fighting in Shizilin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Enemy Ships Concentrated Artillery Fire to Cover Reinforcements Landing; Our Reinforcements Arrived and Launched a Fierce Counterattack and Gained Success</p>
<p>Authentic reports indicate that more than 20 enemy ships in the waters of Shizilin fiercely bombarded our army's positions in Shizilin all day yesterday. Our army responded calmly and remained unmoved. Until dusk yesterday, the enemy artillery concentrated its firepower and cut off the rear road to the south, and reinforcements failed to arrive in time, resulting in a temporary loss. After nightfall, our reinforcements took advantage of the enemy's artillery fire to be slightly weaker, surged forward, and joined the original garrison in Shizilin to launch a fierce counterattack. The fighting was very fierce. As of this morning, our army's front line has been quite successful.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plots to Land at Chunjiang Wharf</h3>
<p>Our Army Is on Strict Alert</p>
<p>At about 10:00 a.m. today, about 30 to 40 enemy troops attempted to secretly cross and land at the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong. The No. 16 destroyer anchored in the heart of the Pujiang River at the Mitsubishi Wharf frequently fired artillery shells at our Pudong positions. As of 1:00 p.m., the artillery fire had not stopped. Our army there is on strict alert, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate them.</p>
<p>China News Agency said that at 9:40 a.m. today, the enemy destroyer No. 16, which was anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf, suddenly fired artillery shells at our Lujiazui area in Pudong, and then stopped immediately. At the same time, two small boats carrying more than 50 enemy plainclothes troops were cruising on the Pujiang surface of the Chunjiang Wharf, seemingly attempting to land.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoitering Pudong for Days</h3>
<p>At about 8:00 p.m. last night, two enemy planes flew to Pudong for reconnaissance. At about 10:00 p.m. late at night, Japanese ships in the Pudong area continuously fired artillery shells again. The shells had a long range and landed in the wilderness fields. At 4:00 a.m. today, the sound of artillery fire started again, and the firepower was even more intense. Our army then fired back, and the shells landed in the Pudong and Hongkou areas, causing the Japanese ships to panic. At 5:00 a.m., heavy artillery was fired continuously, and the sound shook Shanghai. The artillery battle between the two sides lasted for about an hour before stopping. Our side did not suffer any damage. On the contrary, the enemy troops in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas suffered considerable losses due to the accuracy of our targets. At about 7:00 a.m. in the morning, 13 enemy planes flew to the sky over Pudong and conducted low-altitude reconnaissance. Their purpose seemed to be to find our ×× positions. After half an hour, they left without getting anything. At 9:30 a.m., two Japanese ships anchored in Hongkou fired artillery shells again. At that time, the reporter was walking in the ×× area, and the shells passed overhead and shot towards the ×× area. At the same time, four enemy planes flew to spy on our army's movements in preparation for any action. Our side understood the enemy's strategy and ignored the enemy's naval and air operations, except for being on strict alert.</p>
<p>At about 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, enemy artillery indiscriminately fired, dropping two shells on Zhu Asong's milk shed at No. 2, Niqiangquan, east of Hujia Muqiao, Pudong, killing nine cows and injuring eight, with a total loss of more than 10,000 yuan. Also, a shell fell on Zhangtuan Xinjia, east of Pudong, injuring two men and two women, who were all sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy ships anchored on the Pujiang surface of Yangshupu bombarded Pudong for a long time. Our army was not damaged. It is now learned that only three civilians were injured by shrapnel, including Yan Baoxiang, 19 years old, from Hebei, with a 2-inch graze on his head; Ji Rentong, 50 years old, from Hebei, with a back injury; and Gu Xiaoting, 41 years old, from Chongming, with a lacerated and festering left shoulder lung bone. The above three people are all being treated by the 10th Team of the Pudong Red Cross.</p>
<h3>Three Enemy Ships Were Destroyed by Our Bombing</h3>
<p>According to reliable reports from the military authorities, a large squadron of our air force heavily bombed the enemy fleet in the waters of Xiaochuansha at about 7:00 p.m. last night, resulting in the destruction of two destroyers and one cruiser. This achievement has been confirmed by our Nanjing side.</p>
<p>China News Agency said that at about 7:00 p.m. last night, a squadron of our air force flew to Xiaochuansha and bombed enemy ships. At that time, two enemy ships were hit and burned. According to official sources, the two ships that were burned belonged to the destroyer class. In addition, an enemy cruiser was also bombed by our plane and suffered heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Zhabei Again Today</h3>
<p>China News Agency said that at about 7:00 a.m. this morning, more than 10 enemy planes circled in the sky over Shanghai for about two hours. First, they formed a large team in the area south of Shanghai and observed for a long time. Then, they divided into several small teams and dropped bombs and strafed in Zhabei, Pudong, and west of Shanghai. There were especially many bombs dropped in the Zhabei area, and they also used machine guns to strafe. Our garrison fired with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, and the enemy planes fled.</p>
<p>China News Agency said that at about 10:00 a.m. today, three enemy planes dropped bombs in the Beixinjing area. One of the shells exploded near the Avenue Piaton, killing eight civilians and injuring two. There was no other significant loss.</p>
<h3>Izumo Sails to Wusong Estuary Again</h3>
<p>Bombarding Our Army's Positions from Time to Time This Morning</p>
<p>The enemy flagship Izumo sailed to Wusong yesterday morning to command the ships and open fire on our Shizilin and other places in an attempt to help troops land in various places. The ship returned to the Pujiang River at night. This morning, it set off again from the No. 2 buoy in the Pujiang River to Wusong. Three or four enemy ships in the Yangshupu area followed and sailed downstream, bombarding our army's positions everywhere, allowing the enemy troops who arrived to take the opportunity to cover the landing of enemy soldiers in Liuhe and other places. Our army is resisting. Currently, there is a destroyer anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf outside the Baidu Bridge, an enemy cruiser anchored in front of the Gonghexiang Wharf, and an enemy transport ship anchored in the Zhongzhan.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops' Defense Situation in Hongkou</h3>
<p>All Pedestrians are Prohibited From Coming and Going</p>
<p>Dago News Agency said that the enemy troops in the Hongkou area, after reinforcements, are now concentrated in the Japanese Elementary School at No. 465 North Sichuan Road, the Shanghai Bank Corporation at the intersection of Wusong Road and Haining Road, the Japanese Army Military Attaché Office at No. 247 Dixiwei Road, the Willie Grand Theater on Haining Road, the Naval Club at No. 400 Miller Road, the Japanese Army Headquarters at No. 10 Dongjiangwan Road, and the Naval Hospital on Huanglu Road. The remaining troops are deployed on major thoroughfares and on the roofs of the more solid buildings along various roads for defense. At the same time, most of these enemy troops are hiding in the alleys, so it is rare to see traces of enemy troops on the surface. In addition, the Fengyang Hall on Haining Road and the Changpan Hall on Zhapu Road are also occupied by Japanese ruffians and plainclothes troops as their headquarters for planning all kinds of sabotage activities.</p>
<p>Another report stated that, according to a Western newspaper reporter, the Japanese army has now prohibited any third-country nationals from traveling from Broadway to Hongkou. Even those holding passes from the Japanese Consulate are no exception. Therefore, the area is now isolated from the Concessions. It is reported that the motivation of the Japanese army is to prevent foreigners from seeing the military arrangements.</p>

No French warship is expected. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Fuzhou] Several enemy warships and two enemy planes attacked Xiamen again at 3:30 PM this afternoon. Our forces immediately engaged them, fighting fiercely until 4:45 PM, when the enemy planes, damaged, fled, and the enemy warships retreated in defeat. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] When Japanese warships attacked Shanwei on the 4th, they used several small steamships to land hundreds of soldiers. We sank two of these ships, drowning dozens of soldiers. The survivors fled in panic. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Japanese warships attacked Chiwan on the morning of the 6th, attempting to land troops and attack Shenzhen to cut off traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. They were fiercely repelled by our security forces. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The two customs ships seized by the enemy, named "Xun Guan" and "Guan Xiong," are rumored to have been sunk. The location is believed to be in British territorial waters. Hong Kong authorities are investigating. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The British ship "Taishan" left Guangzhou on the evening of the 5th. Near Chiwan, it was intercepted by Japanese warships, which forced it to stop and searched for military supplies. The ship immediately returned to Hong Kong. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Approximately 300 Japanese and Hong Kong women and children are scheduled to return to their countries on the 7th. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Shantou] Six enemy planes flew to Shantou and dropped bombs at 6:25 AM on the 6th. After our forces countered with anti-aircraft fire, they fled. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Five enemy planes attacked Shantou at 5:55 AM on the 6th, dropping several bombs, causing little damage. In Chiwan, part of Bao'an County, four enemy warships arrived at 7:00 AM on the 6th and fired twelve shells, all of which landed in fields. Our garrison immediately responded, and fighting was still ongoing at the time of this dispatch. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>School Reopenings Are Pending</h3>
<p>Concessions Authority Concerned About Safety</p>
<p>Education circles report that due to the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai war and the enemy's wanton destruction of our cultural institutions, such as Tongji University, school authorities are concerned that the youth are wasting their time. They initially planned to find buildings in the French Concession, where it is relatively safe, to resume classes. However, the Concession authorities, concerned about the safety of the Concession, believe that the gathering of young students for classes should be carefully considered. Therefore, the reopening of schools is difficult to implement for the time being.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Blockade of Eastern District of Concession: German General Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>Foreign Businesses Denied Permission to Move Goods. German Chamber of Commerce Cables Protest to Homeland. Other National Chambers of Commerce Express Similar Sentiments.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that since the Japanese military in Shanghai announced the blockade of the eastern district of the Public Concession, various foreign businesses in the city have discussed with the Japanese military authorities to request protection and permission to move foreign goods out of the eastern district. However, the Japanese military authorities have been stubbornly uncooperative, refusing the request. It is reported that the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai cabled the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce on the 3rd of this month, requesting the government to strongly protest this action by the Japanese government. It is also reported that other foreign chambers of commerce in Shanghai have expressed similar sentiments.</p>
<h3>Japan Announces Extension of Blockade Range, Hong Kong Suffers Great Losses</h3>
<p>Foreigners Pay Extreme Attention, British to Protect Merchant Ships with Warships</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Eight hours after the Japanese authorities announced the extension of the blockade range on the 5th, British merchant ships were immediately threatened. Simultaneously, Japanese warships bombarded Chiwan, near Hong Kong, further substantiating previous statements by Japanese leaders that they would not hesitate to bomb the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Foreigners here are paying extreme attention. General opinion is that Hong Kong's sustenance relies entirely on the land and water routes connecting it with Guangzhou. Now that these two routes are threatened, Hong Kong will become a "dead island." The resulting damage to Hong Kong from the blockade will far exceed that suffered by Guangdong. The Japanese initially only targeted Shantou, likely considering this factor. Now, they have rashly implemented the blockade, and the British authorities will inevitably resort to protecting merchant ships with warships. Regardless of how steady and peace-loving they are, once lives are threatened by force, they will have no choice but to protect their lives with force. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] It is reported that Hong Kong authorities will dispatch warships to protect the "Taishan" and "Foshan" ships coming to Guangzhou on the morning of the 7th. (Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[London] It is reported that London is closely considering the legal issues surrounding Japan's announcement of a blockade of Chinese waters. Since the Japanese government has not declared a state of war between China and Japan, this action is contrary to international law. The British government will likely determine its response based on future developments. The general consensus is that unless a major incident occurs, equivalent to a genuine interference with British ships, the British government will not engage in serious negotiations with the Japanese government.

<h3>Xuzhou Militia Fully Deployed</h3>
<p>[Xuzhou] Due to frequent enemy aircraft intrusions, the Xuzhou city militia's defense group has been fully deployed for patrols. They have captured various criminals in recent days, maintaining social order. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to road reports, after enemy aircraft briefly harassed Xuzhou, they only passed through the area at night due to our intense anti-aircraft fire. They did not linger in Xuzhou. Our air defenses remain on alert day and night. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Our Country's Self-Defense Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>British Labor Community Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>[London] Today, during the 69th annual conference of the British Trades Union Congress in Norwich, attended by approximately one thousand delegates, Chairman Bowen (leader of the British Transport and General Workers' Union) mentioned the bombing of the British Ambassador's residence in China by Japanese aircraft, which has caused great public outrage. He stated that while they deeply regret the attack on the British Ambassador, the Japanese have been brutally massacring non-combatants in China for many months. These atrocities are awakening the conscience of the public, and may result in demands for our government to end its weak response to these events. Bowen also expressed hope that the Republican forces in Spain would achieve victory, and stated that he believed British trade union members would sympathize with the efforts of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and integrity today.

<h3>British Ambassador's Bombing: Japan Submits Provisional Reply</h3>
<p>Still Attempts to Evade Responsibility; Great Disappointment in Britain</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the case of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being injured in an attack by Japanese aircraft, officials have confirmed that the Tokyo government has submitted a "provisional" reply after the note submitted by Britain on the 28th of last month. The reply expresses the Japanese government's regret over the incident, but states that the investigation is still ongoing, and therefore a formal response cannot be given. It is understood that the British government will firmly request Japan to provide a complete and clear reply as soon as possible. The new British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is also discussing this matter with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota. British officials also stated that the Japanese government believes it is still difficult to determine whether the perpetrators were members of the Japanese air force, as evidenced by the use of the word "regret" rather than "apology" in the provisional reply. It is said that this "provisional" reply has caused great disappointment in Britain. It is also rumored that Ambassador Craigie will only present his credentials after the three demands raised in the British note have been met. If the Japanese official response is not deemed satisfactory by Britain, the British government is also considering recalling its ambassador. Political figures in Britain also stated that Japan is mistaken if it intends to delay the matter and believes that Britain's attitude will gradually soften. (Havas, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Naval Minister Yonai stated in Parliament today regarding the note sent by the British government to Japan concerning the injury of the British Ambassador to China, Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, that the Imperial Japanese Navy would never, under any circumstances, take actions that violate humanitarian principles. Conservative leader Azuma stated that the British note greatly damages the prestige of Japan and implies that the Japanese army is a barbaric army that frequently engages in attacks on non-combatants. Before Yonai's statement, Foreign Minister Hirota stated that there is no clear evidence that the British Ambassador's car was bombed by Japanese aircraft. The Foreign Ministry firmly believes that the Japanese military never intentionally attacks non-combatants. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Casual Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords are daily proclaiming in their country how victorious and triumphant the war against China is. But according to reliable sources, Japan has recently dispatched five divisions as reinforcements. The so-called most elite Imperial Guard, the Konoe Division, has also been ordered to Shanghai. If they were truly victorious, why would they need to send more troops? This argument disproves itself.</p>
<p>According to a certain foreigner who came to China from Japan, whenever Japanese soldiers are sent to China, their family members, young and old, see them off, and the cries of grief are deafening. Hearing of this situation, we, filled with sympathy, cannot help but shed tears. We wonder what the Japanese warlords think when they hear of this.</p>
<p>Also, according to a young captured child soldier, he was lured to Shanghai by reports that he could eat ice cream and drink soda water if he served there. He did not expect to be sent to the front lines after arriving in Shanghai. What he experienced was the total opposite from the news reports. Ice cream and soda water have harmed people to such an extent, which is deplorable. And the effect of ice cream and soda water has been this great, which is astounding.</p>

<h3>Is the Second European War About to Break Out? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Our European Correspondent, Lieshan</p>
<p>① Will Germany Seize this Once-in-a-Millennium Opportunity?</p>
<p>A German expatriate from South America was complaining to people, lamenting how it was unfair that the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded to Hitler. In the past two or three years, Hitler had in fact made multiple peace speeches after rebuilding the military. An American reporter said that perhaps people did not believe Hitler desired peace, but Hitler himself, having lied so many times, gradually came to believe it himself. Does Hitler want war? This question is not easily answered. Members of the National Socialist Party have repeatedly stated that they do not wish to see the tragedy of bloodshed again, but they definitely want to reclaim Germany's original colonies. Reclaiming colonies through peaceful means is an unprecedented exception in history!</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Hitler himself prefers peace or war, it is a fact that he currently holds the key to the Second European War. The National Socialists hope for a strong Germany. According to their plans, they do not seem to have satisfactory reasons for the current state of Germany. Most National Socialists do not have the luxurious expectation that their goals can be achieved without a war. Military experts estimate that Germany's entire military buildup plan has currently been implemented to sixty or seventy percent. Perhaps it will take another one or two years of preparation to have the strength to fight on both eastern and western fronts. But can Germany wait that long? Who can predict the changes that may occur in one or two years? Furthermore, Britain is currently accelerating its military buildup. Will Germany not seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity?</p>
<p>▲ Britain's Military Buildup Can Already Cope with Sudden Changes? According to a diplomat from a certain country familiar with the political situation in Western Europe, he received reliable information that the British government took the opportunity of the King's coronation ceremony to specially invite the German special envoy to observe the ceremony, General von Blomberg, the Minister of National Defense, to visit the new military equipment of the British navy, army, and air force throughout Britain. After seeing it, General von Blomberg was speechless. Because of this matter, he reprimanded the military attaché of the German Embassy in Britain for being incompetent, as the daily reports were far from the actual situation of British military preparations. General von Blomberg reportedly told people that what he saw this time was enough. He had never imagined that the extent of British military expansion would be so rapid!</p>
<p>Several British newspapers criticized the British military authorities for being rash in exposing the secrets of their military buildup to a future enemy. However, people in diplomatic circles generally believe that this move by the British government was very clever. At least when the Second European War is about to break out, General von Blomberg will have to consider first whether he can take this risk because he is a military expert, and he knows the effectiveness of new weapons. However, a few people also feel that this is still a bit risky. Britain's entire military buildup is not yet complete. Perhaps Germany, after understanding Britain's strength, will realize that if it does not act now and waits one or two years for Britain to be fully prepared, it will have even less chance of success. It may actually accelerate the outbreak of the Second European War! Moreover, the Spanish situation is becoming increasingly pressing, providing Germany with more opportunities to exploit. Will Germany immediately seize this opportunity? This is what everyone is worried about.</p>
<p>Britain and Germany are currently bargaining with each other. Perhaps war can be avoided if the price offered by Britain can satisfy the Germans. Otherwise, in the eyes of the Germans, this once-in-a-millennium opportunity should not be easily let go. If war breaks out at this time, at the very least, the power of the air force can be used to force Britain to strictly maintain neutrality. Although Germany knows that getting involved now is a gamble, because the Germans also know that Britain will eventually join the enemy's side sooner or later.</p>
<p>▲ What is the Fighting Strength of the Red Army? The recent purge of Soviet communists is a mystery. Everyone wants to know what exactly happened, but no one can answer. Even foreign diplomats and journalists stationed in Russia say that it is difficult to believe that eight senior generals in the Red Army really colluded with Hitler. We cannot imagine that Hitler and Mussolini's confidants would collude with Stalin to oppose their leaders. Is it not true? Then why would Czechoslovakia suddenly become anxious, change its entire national defense plan, (it is said that the original plan was leaked to Germany by Red Army General Tukhachevsky), and after this incident, the relationship between France and Russia seems to be even closer than before.</p>
<p>Some speculate that the Soviet purge, the purge of the military, and the purge of the party are two separate matters. Although Trotsky and Tukhachevsky have one thing in common, which is opposition to Stalin, General Tukhachevsky has always been hailed as the Napoleon of the Soviet Union. Perhaps he had political ambitions, but it is not necessarily a fact that he "betrayed the country for personal gain" and ceded Soviet territory to Germany. He probably had a conflict with Stalin's policies from the perspective of a military expert. Here we must remember that the relationship between the Soviet Red Army and the German military has a history of about sixteen or seventeen years. If Hitler had not come to power, the possibility of a military alliance between the two countries would have been very high. (From a geographical and strategic point of view, Germany needed Soviet help to recover its lost territory in the east. Similarly, the Soviet Union also had much territory occupied by Poland and Romania. The two countries are dissatisfied with the current distribution of borders in Eastern Europe, which is a fact.) Over the years, Stalin's pro-French policy naturally conflicted with the original national defense plan of the Red Army, which may have led to this incident.</p>
<p>After the death of General Tukhachevsky and others, the Red Army's cadres have been reorganized. In terms of talent, the strength of the Red Army will naturally be affected. If he was a person who advocated for alliance with Germany (not Hitler) before his death, then the Red Army's contact with Germany will be severed from now on. The German General Staff will truly have to consider the Soviet Union as a major enemy from this point on. (I remember that last year, when Germany and Russia were fiercely attacking each other, British Foreign Secretary Eden said that the politicians of the two countries were just cursing each other, but the soldiers of the two countries were still secretly discussing cooperation. He said this not without reason.)</p>
<p>The current question is, will Germany preemptively strike when the Red Army is in the midst of organizational changes?</p>
<p>Perhaps Hitler will give us an answer after the autumn harvest this year.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse into Wartime Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in North China, Jingzhou has been traveling between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Lushan, delivering several speeches and publishing three or four articles on relief efforts. He also broadcasted one or two times, reporting and commenting on the situation. However, the impact seemed to be minimal. Later, after the Hongqiao Incident, the Red Cross Society used large advertisements to recruit personnel and supplies in preparation, but the donations received were less than a thousand, and there were no specialists among those who volunteered. Although I wouldn't dare say that the people of Shanghai have the saying, "Not crying until they see the coffin," this is the reality, and it cannot but pain Jingzhou. When the cannons roared in Shanghai, many enthusiastic patriots began to assist the Red Cross, which lacked real strength, in a rush to cope with such a great crisis. Colleagues buried themselves in hard work. On the one hand, due to the intensity of the work, there was no time for publicity, and no opportunity for publicity. On the other hand, due to the restrictions of the military (see the Red Cross announcement of August 27), the Shanghai society, where Chinese and foreigners lived together, should not reveal any information related to military affairs. Therefore, the progress of the work was rarely reported to the public. Unexpectedly, the people of Shanghai still could not avoid the custom of celebrating good news, and instead, due to the Red Cross's secrecy about its work, they harbored great suspicions about the Red Cross. Even collaborating groups inevitably began to criticize. Now, the author, driven by this environment, has to choose some of the work processes that can be disclosed to the people of the country and report them, hoping that the people of the country—especially the people of Shanghai—will provide more guidance and support, so that we can pool our wisdom and work together to promote progress.</p>
<p>I. National Relief Preparedness in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Last year, because the Japanese situation in China was deteriorating and national defense was becoming increasingly strained, the central government issued a general outline for emergency area relief, designating a dozen provinces and cities as emergency areas, ordering party and government agencies to participate in guidance, and the local Red Cross branch, medical groups, medical education institutions, chambers of commerce, and other groups related to relief work to form relief committees, with attached appropriate relief agencies, to engage in organization, training, storage, and preparation for military and civilian relief work in wartime. The Ministry of Health and the General Red Cross Society of China were to send personnel, and liaise with the Military Medical Department and other agencies and groups related to relief work in the area, to establish a General Administration of Relief Affairs in the center, to command and dispatch, in order to achieve the effect of mutual cooperation. In addition to issuing notices to all branches across the country to participate in the organization and intensify preparations, the General Red Cross Society also liaised with the General Administration and experts from all walks of life to establish a relief committee, designing assistance, supply, distribution, training, and other matters.</p>
<p>When Tianjin and Peiping were in danger, and the key points along the river and coast were in imminent danger of war, the Red Cross Relief Committee and the General Administration carefully planned and estimated the funds, temporarily estimating 50,000 injured patients, available for five months, purchasing medicines and equipment. On the one hand, they presented to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health to jointly order the provinces and cities to investigate medical personnel, and medical colleges and universities to quickly form relief teams, preparing to organize twenty relief brigades, waiting for orders to compile and distribute the purchased medicines and equipment, allocating one-third of the total number, storing them in six relatively safe places, and the rest for use in the war zone. Of the colleges and universities that complied to form relief teams, except for Tongji and Qilu, which had already been entrusted by the Military Medical Department to organize surgical teams to participate in the work of military injury hospitals, Southeast Tongde was prepared to stay in Shanghai. There were two teams from Shanghai Medical College, and teams from Central, Xiangya, Zhongshan, Huaxi, Guanghua, Nantong, Henan, and Guangxi Medical Colleges, and teams from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Pharmaceutical Vocational Schools. In addition, Hebei Provincial Medical College, with the president as the vice-chairman of the Red Cross North China Relief Committee, had been entrusted by the Red Cross to organize a surgical team to serve in Baoding. The General Administration also issued medicines and equipment to the Yuanmeng Health Center to organize a team and set off at the right time. Other local health agencies that voluntarily organized relief teams included two teams from Wu, and the Gansu Provincial Health Department and Haiyan County Hospital volunteered to be ready to dispatch. The colleagues from the two hospitals in Weihaiwei, the colleagues from the Tancheng Christian Hospital, and hundreds of nurses from the Chinese Nurses Association, and all the male nurses from the Cangxian Boshi Hospital, also applied to the General Administration to be ready to participate in relief work.</p>
<p>II. Battlefield Relief in North China</p>
<p>Since the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War, the Red Cross established a North China Relief Committee in Peiping to promote relief work nearby. During the July 7th Incident, the North China Committee also made considerable efforts to plan and deploy in a hurry. After the fall of Peiping and Tianjin, in addition to urging the personnel stationed in Baoding of the North China Relief Committee to draw a surgical team from Hebei Provincial Medical College, and ordering the Qingyuan branch to cooperate to meet emergency needs, it immediately sent a relief team jointly formed by Zhongda and Central Hospital to serve with a certain army on the Pinghan Line. In addition, it requested another team from Qilu University to go to a certain place on the Jinpu Line to assist military doctors in undertaking relief work. At the same time, it ordered the Xiaozhan, Wuqing Cangjin, Lixian, Renqiu, Yaoyang, Xianxian branches to investigate and report the local situation and prepare for relief. At the same time, the Qingdao, Cangjin, Xuanhua, Luoyang, Dingxing, and Huimin branches also automatically sent letters stating that they had actively prepared. The Xuanhua side requested funding and was approved for allocation. Dingxing and Xianxian also requested medicines and equipment in preparation for running rear hospitals and assisting with all efforts. Details will be reported again after receiving the report. However, the relief work organized by the Red Cross in Nankou, Zhangyuan, and Shangdu has been lacking due to various obstacles. Only military doctors have carried out relief, which we feel is the most worrying.</p>
<p>III. Relief in the Shanghai-Songhu War Zone</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Shanghai war on August 13, the Shanghai Red Cross Branch, the Local Association, the Municipal Party Department, the Social Bureau, the Health Bureau, and other medical groups rushed to form the Shanghai Relief Committee, together with the Red Cross General Society, to arrange everything. The funds were allocated by the Anti-Enemy Support Association. The Medical Affairs Group handled hospitals and relief separately. The Relief Section, from the eve of the start of the war to August 18, successively recruited enthusiastic people as needed, organized ten relief teams and five first-aid teams to rush to Zhabei, Jiangwan, Gujiazhai, Zhenru, Dachang, Nanxiang, Wusong, Hongkou, Luodian, Jiading, Yangxing, Liuhe, Pudong, Bailonggang, Lan Nidu, Nanshi, Longhua, and other places, day and night, risking their lives to rescue and escort wounded soldiers and civilians, sending them to the rescue hospitals, designated hospitals, or Kunshan Field Hospital (initially established in Zhenru, later moved to Kunshan, and the Zhenru hospital site was bombed). Changshu and Suzhou Rescue Hospitals, and Wuxi Red Cross Temporary Hospital received treatment. In order to clear the battlefield and consolidate the military's morale, several burial teams were dispatched to the Pushan Villa to carry out burial work. Each relief team had 53 people and five ambulances, and each first-aid team had 15 to 20 people and three vehicles. Between August 18 and 31, because the Japanese army disregarded humanitarianism and public law, and treated relief personnel with hostility, arbitrarily bombing and shooting, resulting in the tragic killing of one doctor, one nurse, one stretcher team leader, one team leader and one deputy team leader, seven team members, one burial team member, and one team worker. Three team members and one cook were missing. However, all team members continued to work hard, regardless of their own safety, often rushing to the front line to rescue. From the 29th, the association had no choice but to order all teams to work during the day and leave at night to quickly rescue. In total, the war zone in August was dozens of kilometers long, the average number of service team members was 37, and a total of 6,700 soldiers and civilians were rescued. In 19 days, each person rescued an average of 22 and a half people, and each person rescued more than one person every day. The strong spirit of service of each team was highly praised by the military commanders and military authorities. However, according to past situations, it is still inevitable that due to the rapid expansion of the war zone, the personnel, vehicles, and financial resources are insufficient to make appropriate deployments, and because the residences of the teams have been repeatedly bombed, people have been repeatedly injured, and sometimes contact is lost, especially the shortage of vehicles is too bitter, often causing many delays. Recently, after exhausting efforts to dredge the rear traffic, it has been possible to use other vehicles and waterways for simultaneous water and land transport, and to transport the wounded soldiers to other places for treatment. In the future, the escort work may be slightly more convenient.</p>
<p>By the end of August, the Hospital Section had successively established 16 rescue hospitals and designated hospitals. The rescue hospitals had 3,429 beds, and the designated hospitals had 883 beds, accommodating a total of 4,350 wounded soldiers and 988 wounded civilians. Recently, it is planned to add a hospital in a more convenient place for transportation, and to form a medical emergency rescue team to provide temporary treatment when the hospitals are full. Because typhoid patients were found among the wounded soldiers, it is specially planned to set up a hospital for sick soldiers for prevention and treatment. The number of hospital beds will be added successively as needed, but there is still a problem of insufficient beds and overcrowding. Sending patients to the special zone for treatment is a temporary expedient. Once the rear traffic is slightly smooth, efforts must be made to transport them to the rear hospitals. The issues of wounded soldier management and discharge and return to the team have recently been discussed and agreed upon with the military commanders and the Military Medical Department and are being implemented.</p>
<p>The Rear Wounded Soldier Hospital and Field Hospital Committee originally planned to establish four hospitals in Zhenru, Kunshan, Wuxi, and Jiaxing. Later, Zhenru was bombed and merged into Kunshan. Jiaxing has considerable equipment and has not been set up. The first rescue team of the National Shanghai Medical College in Wuxi applied to the General Society for medicines and equipment to organize and had already succeeded. Recently, due to the re-determination of the relief scope by the Shanghai Relief Committee, Kunshan Songjiang was used as the boundary, and the Wuxi Hospital was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Red Cross General Society. At the same time, medicines were allocated to promote the joint organization of a wounded soldier hospital by the Wujin County Government, the medical community, and the Chamber of Commerce to serve together.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting the Japanese army's illegal killing of relief personnel to Wang Rutang, the chairman of the American Association, to be submitted to the League of Nations for disposal, the Red Cross General Society plans to establish a prisoner-of-war hospital to show our great national demeanor and build international visibility. Because it is the malaria season, officers and soldiers on the front line are prone to suffering from abuse and disease. A large number of quinine are transported on schedule for prevention, and it has been suggested that another rear hospital should be set up in a suitable location to facilitate supply. Suzhou, Songjiang, and Changshu have all been issued medicines to assist the branches and relief committees in setting up rescue hospitals. Haimen and Dangtu will prepare to send medicines to assist. The rescue team organized by the Suzhou Nursing Committee has already set off for work.</p>
<p>Jingzhou is not clever and follows the Red Cross to assist in the association's affairs. All measures have been roughly as described above. Things are shown in the mouth, and materials are used as capital. Everything depends on the worthy people of the time. Jingzhou also has a few points here, and wants to hope that the patriotic gentlemen of all walks of life and the medical community will judge and seize them. Please write them down below as an ending to this text of mine.</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai relief work has taken several days of preparation to cope with such a large war situation, and the means of transportation are so lacking, which is fundamentally incompatible. Naturally, it is not easy to do it satisfactorily.</p>
<p>(2) In the long course of the War of Resistance, Shanghai is not a rear area at all. The reason why Shanghai rescue hospitals can rise up like this is that Shanghai's medical community has more talent and equipment, which makes it easier to handle. However, in the long run of the War of Resistance, can the wounded soldiers always move to Shanghai for medical treatment? Or maybe the doctors have to condescend to go to the rear to deal with it. This is what Jingzhou wants to ask his colleagues in the medical community to consider carefully.</p>
<p>(3) There should be a certain standard for running rescue hospitals in the long War of Resistance (the central government will have regulations). The main purpose is to save material resources and prepare for a long time. The social figures below the standard should be restrained. But if we want to achieve above the standard, it seems that we don't need to advocate it. Jingzhou believes that everyone should first have a selfless mind when serving the country. If we don't hope to be rewarded for our merits in the future, then we don't have to compete for novelty now. If doctors in other places objectively see our Shanghai doctors as 'Shanghai style', I'm afraid it's not what you gentlemen would like to hear.</p>
<p>(4) Running a hospital in the special zone and rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line are two completely different things. I hope those who run the hospital can realize that it is not easy to rescue a wounded soldier from the front line. Don't choose to treat the wounded soldiers who are admitted to the hospital. No matter how minor or serious the injuries are, be sure to treat them equally.</p>
<p>(5) Because the general public does not respect the Red Cross, the Red Cross flag is often used for improper and wealthy purposes. Therefore, the authorities in the special zone often have great twists and turns in the entry and exit of wounded soldiers. Now the Red Cross has strict regulations on the use of seals and flags and has informed the military and wealthy bureaus in the special zone. I hope that people from all walks of life will also closely monitor the Red Cross seals and flags, help to stop the confusion, and facilitate the work.</p>
<p>(6) Due to the limited financial resources of the Shanghai War Relief Work, it is very sorry that we have not been able to recruit as many enthusiastic young people as possible, especially students who have received nursing training. However, the reason why we have not been able to send letters for recruitment is also because your addresses have changed, or the original communication addresses have fallen into the war zone. This point should be considered. Please don't feel resentful because of disappointment. This is what I pray for.</p>
<p>(7) Now many people want to go to the rescue hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. The Red Cross rescue hospitals and designated hospitals, in view of the fact that Shanghai is a mixed residence of Chinese, must also abide by military and police orders, and the gate must be closed tightly. Therefore, all consolations are rejected, and it is inevitable to offend people. Please understand.</p>

<h3>National B-Type Seafarers Fundraising Patriotic Donation</h3>
<p>Joint Meeting Decides on Five Measures</p>
<p>The China Seafarers Anti-Enemy Support Association, jointly formed by Chinese seafarer organizations, is indignant that the Japanese are attacking us. All nationals are indignant. Therefore, in order to consolidate the rear and assist the front line, in addition to the fact that all A-type seafarers have decided to levy a one-day salary for patriotic donations, the Association's Fundraising Section convened representatives of various seafarer organizations and team leaders of various fundraising teams, and decided on the following five standards for the national B-type seafarer fundraising patriotic donation. (1) All wheel and water sailors, cargo supervisors, and workshop workers shall be levied 4% of their original salary. (2) All workers in the cabin department of all wheels shall be levied one yuan of national currency per person. (3) The chief steward of the catering department of all wheels shall be levied two yuan of national currency, and the second steward and below shall be levied five cents of national currency. (4) All workers on the small Yangtze wheels shall be levied one yuan of national currency per person. (5) Workers on small inland wheels shall donate one day's salary. The persons in charge of each wheel and each department shall work hard to raise funds, and submit the accumulated amount to the Association, which will be donated to the government. In addition, the Association will also prepare more sealed patriotic donation tubes and distribute them to designated persons in charge of each wheel to pass on passenger wheels, and passengers can donate at any time to fulfill their national duties. However, regardless of the amount, the collectors on each wheel will issue a receipt, and the passengers will deposit it themselves.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Creates Unprecedented Record</h3>
<p>More than a Thousand Times Last Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade sent out ambulances 1,038 times last month, setting a record. Among them, 792 times were for emergency rescue, 204 times were for transferring hospitals, and 42 times were for transporting people suffering from infectious diseases. Fire engines were dispatched 158 times during the month. This shows the hard work of the members of the Association. The other day (5th), a fire broke out in the Eastern District, burning 14 Chinese-style houses. There were also two fires in the Central District, but they were extinguished soon. Ambulances were dispatched 30 times and transported a total of 16 injured or sick people to the hospital. Most of them were related to the current situation. Four residents were injured by shrapnel, etc. Fires often occur in various places in Zhabei, and are reported by the lookout station at any time.</p>
